Entry Date: Unconfirmed

&#147;The doctors say you&#146;ll be fine in a few weeks. Is there anything I 
can do for you while you&#146;re here?&#148;

That Shinobu-chan&#133;it&#146;s nice of her to volunteer to take care of my 
affairs while I&#146;m stuck in this damn hospital but personally, I&#146;d 
prefer to keep an eye on how she handles them. I insisted on her 
calling me on my cell phone for every major decision to be made. It&#146;s 
not exactly the control I look for in such things but I don&#146;t really 
have much of a choice, having a broken leg and arm. It&#146;s a good thing 
my internal bleeding has been fixed.

I&#146;ve only been able to get the strength to move myself about recently, 
after that little incident. Aoyama&#133;I hate being hammered like that. I 
hate her even more. Her bitter insistence on getting rid of me is 
completely insane. She broke my leg, my arm, caused various internal 
organs to bleed badly. I don&#146;t have the strength to fight back, not 
yet anyway. I&#146;ll have my revenge soon enough, I just need to get my 
strength back. At least she didn&#146;t break my favorite naginata.

She broke my right arm but at least I can still write with my left. I 
never thought I&#146;d be so thankful for being ambidextrous. I will have 
my revenge, you mark my words. I&#146;ll make her know what it is to call 
out for, to beg, to pray for death. I still can&#146;t open my left eye, 
damn glass hard must have got to it somehow when she blasted me out 
the window. Oddly enough, I am sure she was out to kill me that time. 
I could almost see that light at the tunnel people say you see before 
you die but&#133;I&#146;m alive.

I guess whoever is up there doesn&#146;t think I&#146;m done yet. Or whoever is 
down there is afraid I&#146;ll take over.

I have entrusted the renovations of Hinata Sou to Shinobu-chan, 
hopefully it doesn&#146;t keep her too busy. If anything though, it&#146;ll help 
Miho-san spend some time with her own son. Shinobu-chan says 
Shinji-kun spends too much time with her so this&#146;ll be a good 
opportunity. Damn bloodstains. I have an eye that is temporarily 
blinded and my other seems capable only of seeing red. I hate red. 
I&#146;ve always hated the color red, the color of passion and of love. Two 
things I never had in my life.

Aoyama&#133;she&#146;ll pay, I swear it.

I hate feeling like this, being like this, I have being vulnerable. It 
doesn&#146;t feel right, my body being incapable of fending off attackers 
by itself. I half-expect Aoyama to come charging in with her katana, 
ready to send me to the next world. Damn it. My kidneys are still 
healing but at least they&#146;re functioning properly. There was something 
strange about those two, I was certain Aoyama would have killed me 
then and there until Shinobu-chan stood in the way, if I wasn&#146;t 
hallucinating from blood loss.

There was that look in Aoyama&#146;s eyes, something I couldn&#146;t quite 
place. What it is, I have my suspicions but I&#146;d rather not inform 
anyone of them for now. For the time being, I have to keep a lot of 
things to myself. The past seven years, my suspicions, my secrets. I 
hate to say this, to even think this, but I have to find Kana again. I 
have to be sure that what he said wasn&#146;t just the ranting of a madman. 
Why am I obsessing over this? It makes no sense. Why do I feel so cold 
towards every other kill and yet my conscience won&#146;t let up on this 
one? Is it because he was connected to&#133;Shinobu-chan?

I don&#146;t understand it. Why do I feel so&#133;alive when I&#146;m around her? I&#146;d 
wake up in the middle of the night with the insane desire to hold her 
in my arms, to just hold her to me. Why do I feel so alive when she 
visits me in the hospital, with those red roses? I hate red, I don&#146;t 
like roses too much either. Why do I feel this way? Why do I want to 
be around her? And that time in the park&#133;my arms around her&#133;I almost 
drew myself in&#133;I could see her going the same way&#133;damn it! What is 
wrong with you Kanako!

Bah! I need my painkillers. I still have a revenge to plan&#133;
