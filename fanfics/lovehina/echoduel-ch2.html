<a href="../lovehina/echoduel-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>They stood there on the crowded street in the middle
of Shinjuku, the boyish pink haired young woman and
her dusky companion, each looking at each other
silently. Utena smiled down at her hesitantly, &quot;It&#39;s
good... to see you, Anthy.&quot;

&quot;Utena,&quot; Anthy smiled back, looking up at the taller
woman. The casually dressed young woman took a deep
breath, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, for everything I did.&quot;

Utena closed her eyes for a moment, remembering the
shock of pain and betrayal, then she firmly shook it
off. &quot;What I did,&quot; she finally answered her, &quot;I did of
my own free will, Anthy.&quot; A weak smile, &quot;It wasn&#39;t
your fault.&quot;

Anthy reached up to rest her hand on Utena&#39;s cheek,
tears glistening in her eyes. &quot;You haven&#39;t changed,&quot;
she murmured.

Utena shook her head, &quot;Oh, I&#39;ve changed, it&#39;s just not
that noticable.&quot; The noise around them rose as she
made a face, &quot;Let&#39;s go find someplace to talk?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; and Anthy hesitantly reached for
Utena&#39;s hand.

&quot;Hgow did you find me?&quot; Utena asked, somehow knowing
that it wasn&#39;t a coincidence that Anthy had run into
her like that.

&quot;I&#39;ve been looking for you for years,&quot; Anthy answered
her promptly, &quot;right after you left Ohtori.&quot; She gave
Utena a slight smile, &quot;You certainly moved around a
lot.&quot;

&quot;I wanted to let you go,&quot; Utena said softly as they
passed beneath a glowing neon sign, &quot;to set you free
from any obligation to me.&quot;

Anthy squeezed Utena&#39;s hand slightly as she looked up
to give her a reproachful look, &quot;I didn&#39;t want to be
free of you.&quot; She took a deep breath, &quot;I love you.&quot;

&quot;I....&quot; Utena stumbled, visibly shocked to hear that
from her.

Anthy steadied her, looked at Utena with honest
concern. &quot;You really didn&#39;t expect me to tell you
that?&quot; she asked softly.

Utena looked up, noticing that they were standing by a
small cafe. &quot;Let&#39;s go in here,&quot; she turned to lead
Anthy into the small shop, &quot;we can talk easier
inside.&quot;

Anthy silently followed Utena to a corner table,
sitting there apart from the other customers. They
ordered tea, remembering times that they had spent
together drinking it back at the academy then sat
there quietly a moment until their cups were
delivered.

&quot;You know everything,&quot; Anthy said into the near
perfect stillness, &quot;about Akio and I, the Duels and
Dios. Is that why...?&quot;

Utena took a drink of her tea, feeling the warmth
slide down her throat. &quot;It&#39;s not that,&quot; she answered,
&quot;from what I knew of Dios I think I would have fallen
in love with him, too.&quot;

&quot;Then... Akio?&quot; Anthy asked.

Utena sighed softly, &quot;I think in some ways I hated
him, you know. He tried to take my strength away, to
make me a helpless princess....&quot;

Anthy sighed, &quot;Like me.&quot;

&quot;You were never weak,&quot; Utena shook her head firmly,
&quot;in some ways I think you&#39;re the strongest woman I
know.&quot;

That made Anthy smile, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Utena stirred her tea, the woman clearly looking for
the right thing to say. &quot;I don&#39;t... know you, Anthy,&quot;
she admitted softly.

&quot;What?&quot; Anthy blinked.

&quot;If that moment on the dueling field taught me
anything it was that,&quot; Utena sighed, &quot;despite knowing
you for so long, I never even saw it coming.&quot;

Anthy closed her eyes, a look very like pain on her
pretty face. &quot;You know me better than you think,&quot; she
finally said.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Utena asked.

&quot;I was never false about how I felt about you,&quot; Anthy
softly said as she drank, &quot;I just believed that Akio&#39;s
needs were more important.&quot;

That left them sitting in silence, uncomfortable in
the dim light of the corner. &quot;You spent so long
looking for me,&quot; Utena finally asked, &quot;what... were
you looking for?&quot;

&quot;To make amends,&quot; she admitted, Anthy smiling shyly as
she continued, &quot;I wanted to know that you were all
right, Utena.&quot; She paused before blurting, &quot;What were
you doing the last two years? I&#39;d get a fix on where
you were, rush there then find you were gone.&quot;

&quot;Trying to be a prince,&quot; Utena answered ruefully. A
small sip, &quot;Maybe because of the power of Dios or
maybe it&#39;s just me, but I seem to be drawn to those in
need.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not the power,&quot; Anthy shyly reached out to set
her hand on Utena&#39;s, &quot;you just have a noble heart and
eyes that cannot look away.&quot;

They talked on for several hours, these two young
women, filling in many of the details of the years
that they had spent apart. There were smiles on their
faces when the waitress finally came along to
apologetically tell them that the cafe was closing up
for the night.

Anthy shivered slightly, the night air having grown
cool. Casually Utena pulled her jacket off to drape
over Anthy&#39;s shoulders, &quot;Here.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Anthy looked up to smile warmly, pulling
the jacket closer over her casual dress. She smiled at
Utena&#39;s boyish clothes and added, &quot;We seem to be in
our roles, tonight.&quot;

&quot;I do have a few dresses now,&quot; Utena smiled slightly
as they set out together, walking casually under the
street lights.

&quot;I&#39;m so shocked,&quot; Anthy said with dry humor. She
hesitated, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t presume that you&#39;ll take me
home with you, Utena.&quot;

Utena pushed her pink hair back with a sigh, &quot;Not now,
maybe, but in time...&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Anthy said happily. She pulled a white
card from her pocket and quickly wrote something on
the back, &quot;I&#39;ve been staying here, using it as a sort
of a home base while I was moving around Japan.&quot;

&quot;Hinata Inn?&quot; Utena blinked, noting the address and
phone number. She flipped the card over to see Anthy&#39;s
name and printed below, &quot;Fortunes Told, Spiritual
Advisor.&quot;

Anthy shrugged at Utena&#39;s questioning glance. &quot;I tend
to be pretty good at it,&quot; she said simply, &quot;or so I&#39;m
told.&quot;

Utena chuckled, &quot;I thought about having a card printed
with &#39;Have Sword, Wuill Travel&#39; on it, but I didn&#39;t
think anyone would get it.&quot;

Anthy shook her head, &quot;American westerns?&quot;

Utena just shrugged. She flashed a sudden smile,
&quot;Maybe next time you can come and meet my Aunt, I&#39;m
staying with her in town.&quot;

Anthy&#39;s face lit up with a smile, &quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot; She
sighed softly, looking up at the night sky, &quot;I&#39;d
better get a taxi back.&quot;

Utena waved one down smoothly, opening up the back
door for Anthy smoothly. &quot;I will call you, soon,&quot;
Utena promised.

&quot;I&#39;ll be waiting,&quot; Anthy murmured as she leaned in to
press her lips to Utena&#39;s cheek. With a wave she
climbed inside, the taxi smoothly sliding into
traffic.

Utena stood there watching until the red tail lights
went around a corner then she shook her head with a
soft sigh. &quot;Even after two years,&quot; she smiled to
herself wryly, &quot;she can still wrap me around her
little finger.&quot;</pre>
