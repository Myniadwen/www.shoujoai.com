&#147;Today is a good day to die.&#148;

Well, not really. It just felt appropriate to put that in. Anyway, 
this game is going well. I am surprised however that the endgame is 
coming this soon. It is a rather unexpected move. It feels a little 
too simple, if you ask me. Something is going to go wrong, I can feel 
it. Something drastic is going to happen and I should be ready for it. 
The poker faces are on, should I call their bluff?

&#147;Coffee. Black.&#148;

I can never understand why some people actually prefer their coffee 
black. The taste is unbearable. Anyway, that is beside the point. I m 
alarmed by the sudden quickness of this game&#146;s pacing. I&#146;ve never 
failed to accurately predict the pace of these things but somehow&#133;I 
must have failed to properly anticipate Motoko&#146;s factor in the 
outcome.

&#147;Shields up.&#148;

Certainly, I failed to see just how Motoko-san&#146;s actions but I 
certainly hope I won&#146;t make that mistake again. For Shinobu-chan&#146;s 
sake, I can&#146;t afford to make another mistake. She&#146;s afraid of 
something that is absolutely certain. Is she afraid of something? Is 
she afraid that she made a mistake? I would like to think that she has 
the confidence to face this situation but I am not sure. As her 
sister, I have to protect her.

&#147;Target their weapons array.&#148;

I could see it though; Motoko-san may no longer be a problem. I&#146;m not 
sure why but something in her eyes during those fleeting moments of 
silence before we all went our separate was that day makes me think 
she won&#146;t be on the offensive in this game. I mean no offense but 
samurai are not exactly known for their skills as manipulators and 
users of dirty tactics. I simply mean her moves have been too easy to 
read but&#133;

&#147;The Force is strong with you young one, but you are not yet a Jedi&#133;&#148;

As for Kanako-san, I must confess an attraction to her from early on 
and even until now. Yes, I admit that I love looking into those brown 
eyes of hers, those eyes that hold such mystery for me. She has the 
makings of a true master. That is absolutely certain. There is a fire 
in her eyes; it reminds me in the days of my youth. Kanako-san is a 
definitely cunning but soon&#133;well, she&#146;ll be playing with the best of 
them.

&#147;Do or do not. There is no try.&#148;

This is becoming all too interesting for me to ignore. Still, I can&#146;t 
afford to make my move just yet. The events don&#146;t call for it yet. I 
have a feeling that that time will come sooner than I expect. I&#146;ll 
have to be careful and listen for the cues. Whatever or whoever causes 
this little game to end, I don&#146;t know, presumes to know or care. All I 
can really be sure of is that&#133;I&#146;ll be there to see it.

&#147;I am The Game.&#148;

The players in this little game: Shinobu-chan, Motoko-san and 
Kanako-san. What are they going to do? What cards will they bring to 
the table? Will they call each other&#146;s bluffs? This is going to be fun 
to watch, probably even more so to maneuver for me to get just the 
right angle to watch it all. In any case, I have a feeling that the 
time for me to make my move is coming&#133;
