<h1>Echoes of a Final Duel (part 9 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../lovehina/index.html">Love Hina</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../lovehina/echoduel-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Tendo Nabiki had a grim look on her face as the black
haired young woman stood by the warehouse, the work
crews gathered outside milling about aimlessly. The
car pulled up and she strode over, clearly saying,
&quot;Arisugawa, we&#39;ve got a problem.&quot;

Arisugawa Juri slammed the door to her sports car as
the orange haired woman stood, her back straight with
annoyance. &quot;You said on the phones the crews are
refusing to work?&quot; she said crisply, walking with
Nabiki over to the waiting teams.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Nabiki nodded before dropping her voice,
&quot;Representatives of the local yakuza family have made
it clear that if they continue working, they&#39;ll regret
it.&quot;

Juri swore softly under her breath the sighed, &quot;All
right, lets talk to the chief.&quot; The older man was
quite apologetic but he was firm that his crews were
not going to work until they had some assurance that
the yakuza wasn&#39;t going to injure or kill them.

&quot;Do you want me to try calling in other workers?&quot;
Nabiki asked.

Juri flipped open her phone as she said, &quot;No, I bet
word has gotten around by now. Excuse me.&quot; She dialed
fast as she excused herself, stepping away to make
talking easier.

&quot;Hello?&quot; a pleasant female voice asked after a moment.

&quot;Aoi, it&#39;s Juri,&quot; she answered with a smile, &quot;how are
you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Aoi answered with amusement, &quot;and we&#39;re
still a topic of conversation here at Bokuto police
station.&quot;

&quot;I swear, you police are just a bunch of gossips,&quot;
Juri chuckled as she ran a hand through her hair. More
seriously she said, &quot;I hate to impose but I need to
know who the leader of the Yakuza here in Shinjuku
is.&quot;

&quot;I can find out in a moment,&quot; Aoi said, adding
worriedly &quot;Having some trouble?&quot;

&quot;Nothing I can&#39;t handle.&quot; Juri reassured her friend.

&quot;All right,&quot; after a moment Aoi said, &quot;the leader is
the Ooedo clan, though we don&#39;t know who is head right
now.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, I owe you another night out, maybe,&quot; Juri
said, earning a chuckle from her friend before saying
good-bye.

&quot;You have friends in the police?&quot; Nabiki asked after
Juri rejoined her.

&quot;One or two,&quot; Juri downplayed it. She started dialing
again, &quot;We&#39;re going to need some muscle, then we&#39;re
going to play the Ooedo clan a visit.&quot;

Only a few minutes later they stared arriving, all of
them dressed up for the occasion. Ordinary clothes had
been exchanged for leather jackets and jeans,
headbands and boots. All in all the band of women
looked more like a group of punks than one would have
thought possible.

&quot;So working on a club is what&#39;s been keeping you away
from Michiru and I?&quot; Tenoh Haruka asked, sandy blonde
hair falling into her eyes. She had been one of the
first to answer Juri&#39;s call, a old friend from Juri&#39;s
more wild period.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I plan to invite you both to the grand
opening,&quot; Juri said calmly as they climbed into the
cars.

&quot;So what are we planning?&quot; Ryouko asked, the blue
haired space pirate hefting a wooden practice sword
she had borrowed for effect.

&quot;We need to negotiate from a position of strength,&quot;
Juri said calmly, &quot;so you&#39;ll all help me bust in then
I&#39;ll talk to their Oujo.&quot;

Over in the other car Minagi casually sat in the
passenger seat, Ryouko&#39;s twin cracking her knuckles in
studded gloves she found somewhere. &quot;When Juri called
I wasn&#39;t expecting something this fun,&quot; she smirked.

&quot;You have an interesting definition of fun,&quot; Makoto
Kino said wryly, the brown haired amazon sitting in
the back seat, &quot;though I tend to agree with you.&quot;

&quot;How did you get drafted into this?&quot; Nabiki asked
curiously.

Makoto chuckled as she said, &quot;I was over at Haruka&#39;s
when Juri called and Haruka suggested it might be
fun.&quot;

They stopped up the street from the address Juri had
been given, then Juri faced her troops. &quot;Don&#39;t go too
far,&quot; she advised them, &quot;there are mostly just
ordinary guys we&#39;ll be facing. All I want you to do is
delay them so that I can get to the boss.&quot;

&quot;Awww,&quot; Ryouko pouted, tapping the wooden sword
against her shoulder.

&quot;If anyone&#39;s carrying guns Ryouko or Minagi get them,&quot;
Juri said firmly, &quot;other than that divide the goons as
you wish. Ready?&quot;

&quot;Lets do this,&quot; Nabiki said firmly.

Juri lead the way up the street to the traditional
home, well aware of the figures who were watching
them. As they neared the front a large, heavily
muscled figure appeared at the door, staring down at
them menacingly. &quot;What do you want?&quot; he asked, the
bald young man looking over the group warily.

&quot;We&#39;re here to see the Ojou,&quot; Juri said calmly, &quot;about
why work has been stopped on building my nightclub.&quot;

&quot;Ojou don&#39;t see anyone without an appointment...&quot; he
started then ooofed as a fist suddenly hammered him in
the gut.

&quot;Tetso,&quot; a blonde haired punk yelled in alarm then
roared, &quot;shit, it&#39;s a raid!&quot;

Juri&#39;s people swept in as the gangsters responded,
quickly taking on the men as Juri strode forward. They
were outnumbered but refused to give ground to the
gangsters, striking with speed and force to drive them
backwards.

&quot;What the hell?&quot; the black haired woman yelled as she
raced into the room, hair tied back in twin ponytails.
She instantly assessed the situation and spotted Juri
as the leader, racing forward with a yell of, &quot;You
bitch!&quot;

Juri parried the first punch then struck outward,
surprised to see the other woman dodge. Back and forth
they fought as the sounds of battle slowly stilled,
everyone seemingly hypnotized by the two women&#39;s
combat. After a few moments they stopped, looking into
each other&#39;s eyes warily.

&quot;Sorry to burst in like this,&quot; Juri said a bit
breathlessly, &quot;but I didn&#39;t figure I could see you any
other way.&quot;

&quot;Maybe so,&quot; the woman agreed, equally winded. She
straightened, looking at Juri with respect, then
turned to her men. &quot;What the hell are you standing
around here for? Get this mess cleaned up!&quot;

&quot;See if you can help,&quot; Juri told her own people as she
and the other women went off to talk.

&quot;Sorry about the gut punch,&quot; Ryouko told the big guy
apologetically.

&quot;I&#39;m good,&quot; Tetso wheezed.

&quot;Yamaguchi Kumiko,&quot; she introduced herself as she
offered Juri sake.

&quot;Arisugawa Juri,&quot; she took the cup as they settled on
the mats in the small room. She studied Kumiko
thoughtfully, &quot;Ojou, why are you interested in my
club?&quot;

&quot;Two reasons,&quot; Kumiko answered calmly, &quot;first, you
didn&#39;t clear construction with my people and another
club I control in this area is worried about
competition.&quot;

&quot;I most humbly apologize for the first one,&quot; Juri
bowed her head slightly, &quot;may I ask which club is
concerned?&quot;

&quot;The Yasuke club,&quot; Kumiko answered.

&quot;I don&#39;t think our clients will cross over,&quot; Juri
said, well aware of the hostess club, &quot;you see, I&#39;ll
only be serving lesbians.&quot;

Kumiko blinked, &quot;You&#39;re serious?&quot;

Juri nodded, &quot;Yes, Ojou.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;ll reassure her,&quot; Kumiko mused. She studied
Juri, &quot;I suppose if I asked for a... gratuity to keep
your club free of trouble you&#39;d refuse?&quot;

&quot;The Ojou is a wise woman,&quot; Juri said calmly.

Kumiko fought back a smile, &quot;All right, I&#39;ll let work
continue but I have a condition.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Juri asked warily.

&quot;You have good people out there,&quot; Kumiko said, &quot;I&#39;d
like the option to borrow them one time if the need
arises.&quot;

Juri hesitated, &quot;Not for anything illegal?&quot;

&quot;Fighting in the streets is illegal, but I know what
you mean,&quot; Kumiko said seriously, &quot;so, do we have a
deal?&quot;

&quot;A deal, thank you,&quot; Juri nodded.

To be continued...

Under Arrest.</pre>
