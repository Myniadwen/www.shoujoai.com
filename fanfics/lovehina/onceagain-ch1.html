<h1>Love Hina: Once Again (part 1 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../lovehina/index.html">Love Hina</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Kanako Urashima looked at her elder brother, her brown eyes gently 
worried. &quot;Are you sure about this, Oniisama?&quot; she asked him, black 
ponytail falling down her back. She wore a white vest over her usual 
black dress, her clothes as neat as if she was going to a business 
meeting.

Keitaro Urashima smiled fondly as his little sister, his brown hair 
falling in a unruly mess before his glasses. He looked good dressed in 
his labcoat over school clothes, kneeling in the manager&#39;s room of the 
Hinata girl&#39;s dorm. &quot;I think so,&quot; he answered seriously, &quot;my being a 
part time manager isn&#39;t good for the dorm.&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m the best person to replace you,&quot; Kanako pointed 
out seriously, &quot;I kind of made a mess of things before.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s an understatement,&quot; Kuro the black cat muttered, flicking his 
long ears.

&quot;Hush,&quot; Kanako chided him.

&quot;Oh I don&#39;t know,&quot; the quiet voice said as she entered the room, &quot;I 
think you did a pretty good job, considering.&quot; Naru Narusegawa smiled as 
she slid the door shut behind her, carrying in the tray of drinks. She 
knelt beside Keitaro as she added, &quot;I haven&#39;t seen you since the 
wedding.&quot;

&quot;Grandmother has had me busy with my training,&quot; Kanako said just a bit 
stiffly. In truth she had been trying to adjust to the idea of her 
brother and Naru&#39;s marriage, as well as letting go of her own dreams on 
the subject.

Naru&#39;s smiled was gently sympathetic, &quot;I&#39;m sure.&quot; She took a deep 
breath, &quot;I&#39;m going into full time teaching this fall, so I can&#39;t run the 
dorm, either.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve always dreamed of running the dorm,&quot; Keitaro pointed out, 
&quot;here&#39;s your chance.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Kanako corrected firmly, &quot;I dreamed of running the Hinata Inn.&quot;

&quot;I think there&#39;s a way you can run both the dorm for the girls and have 
a inn here, too,&quot; Keitaro said to her enthusiastically.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Kanako looked curious.

&quot;With the destruction of the annex we suddenly have a whole new section 
to build in,&quot; Naru offered with a grin, &quot;and the insurance would cover 
the cost of building a separate Inn, and even opening up the rest of the 
vacant rooms in the dorm.&quot;

&quot;That could work...&quot; Kanako blinked.

&quot;How would you do it?&quot; Keitaro asked curiously, taking a drink.

&quot;Like I did earlier I&#39;d offer reduced rents to any residents who want to 
work in the new inn,&quot; Kanako offered promptly before adding a bit 
sheepishly, &quot;though I think I&#39;ll run the dorm a bit more loosely than 
last time.&quot;

Naru fought back a laugh even as Keitaro looked mildly confused, the 
young man still largely unaware of the reign of terror Kanako had 
instituted last time.

Meanwhile over at the Cafe Hinata there was a conference going on, 
several young women gathered around the table. Mitsune Konno smiled as 
the sandy blonde served the drinks, then Kitsune asked, &quot;So how much 
trouble are we in?&quot;

Shinobu Maehara looked worried, the black haired younger woman flushing 
slightly, &quot;But Sempai wouldn&#39;t let anything happen.&quot;

&quot;Still,&quot; Motoko Aoyama said as she drank her tea, her shrine maiden&#39;s 
garb crisply neat, &quot;I have my misgivings about the evil one&#39;s return.&quot;

&quot;Calling her the Evil One is a bit much,&quot; Kitsune sat down with a smile, 
her Cafe Hinata apron a bit messy. Since she and Mutsumi Otohime being 
given the cafe Kitsune had really blossomed, becoming a capable manager 
of the business.

&quot;I thought she was fun,&quot; Koalla Su noted cheerfully, the dusky skinned 
blonde grinning.

&quot;You think that everyone is fun,&quot; Shinobu teased.

&quot;So who is she again?&quot; Ema Maeda asked them tentatively, her long brown 
hair flowing. The newest resident of Hinata Inn was still getting used 
to the place, even a few months after her arrival just before Keitaro 
and Naru&#39;s wedding, but she seemed to be settling in nicely.

&quot;Kanako is Keitaro&#39;s younger sister by adoption,&quot; Kitsune cheerfully 
explained, &quot;who ran the dorm for awhile after Keitaro went to study 
abroad. She tried to convert the place back into a Inn and we resisted, 
sorta.&quot;

&quot;Sort of? I seem to remember armed conflict,&quot; Mutsumi reminded them as 
she sent the last few lunch customers out. The busty graduate student 
settled down with a happy sigh, her brown hair flowing in waves, two 
antenna sticking up from the front.

&quot;Armed conflict?&quot; Ema squeaked.

&quot;Thankfully Keitaro returned before Kanako could go through with her 
attempt to destroy the Inn with explosives,&quot; Motoko noted, drinking a 
bit more tea.

&quot;And she tried to burn Kitsune at the stake,&quot; Su added eagerly.

&quot;Now you&#39;re scaring her,&quot; Shinobu scolded, seeing the look on Ema&#39;s 
face.

&quot;Kanako settled down quite a bit before she left,&quot; Kitsune noted.

&quot;I think we should giver her a chance,&quot; Mutsumi said, looking around and 
meeting everyone&#39;s eyes. &quot;A lot of what happened before was our fault, 
too,&quot; she reminded them.

&quot;Hmph,&quot; Motoko smoothly rose, collecting her sword from nearby then 
walking out of the cafe without another word.

&quot;Guess she&#39;s still carrying a grudge,&quot; Su blinked.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen her do that, just leave without a word,&quot; 
Ema looked to where the law student and sword master had gone.

&quot;She and Kanako...&quot; Kitsune hesitated, &quot;she won&#39;t talk about it but 
something happened just after Kanako arrived.&quot; She looked over at 
Mutsumi, &quot;But yeah, I think you&#39;re right.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll give Kanako a chance and see what happens,&quot; Shinobu agreed.

&quot;Besides we can always gang up on her if something bad happens,&quot; Su 
added cheerfully.

&quot;Su!&quot; everyone scolded.

Motoko strode away from the cafe and up the sidewalk, her own thoughts 
in turmoil behind her cool expression. The Gods Cry School taught her to 
focus to seek inner calm, but she found it difficult even under the blue 
skies of the Hinata Dorm.

&quot;Skree!&quot;

Flinging up a arm Motoko caught Shippu, the phoenix-like bird that she 
had inherited from her sister Tsuruko along with the leadership of the 
Gods Cry School. She always seemed to know when Motoko needed her, the 
bird returning to provide comfort and a bit of peace.

&quot;I wish things were that easy,&quot; Motoko murmured as she stroked the 
bird&#39;s head absentmindedly as she returned to the dorms and headed to 
her room... only to stop in surprise as she saw who waited there.

Kanako stood by the door, fidgeting a bit as she waited. Her face was 
grave as she saw Motoko approach, &quot;Hello.&quot;

&quot;What do you want?&quot; Motoko coldly asked, knowing that she was being rude 
but still unable to help herself.

Kanako hesitated, then she knelt on the floor before the startled 
Motoko. &quot; Aoyama-sama,&quot; she said formally, &quot;I committed a great wrong 
when I met you, and humbly wish to beg your forgiveness.&quot; Then she 
bowed, pressing her head to the floor.

&quot;Get up,&quot; Motoko said, deeply uncomfortable.

Kanako rose, dusting off her skirt, her expression serious. &quot;I took 
gross advantage of you when we first met, an act I deeply regret. More 
so now, since I&#39;ve gotten to know what kind of person you are. I don&#39;t 
expect you to forget what happened,&quot; she finished, &quot;but I hope you might 
forgive.&quot;

Motoko hesitated, studying Kanako thoughtfully for a moment. &quot;So,&quot; she 
said softly, &quot;the rumor is true, you are coming back to manage the 
dorms?&quot;

&quot;Hopefully doing a better job than last time,&quot; Kanako nodded.

Her cat Kuro bounded up on her shoulder as he remarked, &quot;Couldn&#39;t do 
much worse.&quot;

&quot;Hush,&quot; Kanako frowned at him.

&quot;You&#39;re right that I won&#39;t forget,&quot; Motoko agreed, &quot;but... I will give 
you a chance.&quot; She met Kanako&#39;s eyes, &quot;But if anything like that happens 
to someone else at the dorms, I will show no mercy.&quot;

&quot;You have my word,&quot; Kanako nodded, &quot;besides, I&#39;m not a lesbian.&quot;

A grim little smile appeared on Motoko&#39;s lips, &quot;Kanako, you are the one 
who jumped me.&quot; With that she slid the door open and went into her room, 
leaving a very thoughtful Kanako standing out in the hallway.

To be continued...

Authors Notes: This is the first chapter of a Love Hina based crossover 
series, set shortly after the end of the manga and the anime Love Hina 
Again. By the way Ema is a new character from the final manga, not my
