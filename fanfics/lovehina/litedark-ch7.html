<h1>Angel Light, Angel Dark (part 7 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../lovehina/index.html">Love Hina</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kanako.html">Kanako Urashima</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../lovehina/litedark-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Night in Hinata Sou. The stars twinkling in the sky, the moon was not 
present and the darkness was serenely overwhelming, it was the very 
definition of a starry, starry night. Van Gogh was probably the only 
master to have truly captured the essence of that scene, Kanako 
thought, as she sat on the roof with her legs bent towards her, a 
slight smile forming at the end of her pale lips. Alone amongst the 
stars, she had long forgotten how comfortable it was for her to be 
like that. She silence, the embrace of the shadows, the serenity, the 
way the stars seemed to phase in and out of the reality that was the 
night sky, she had been away from it far too long. The renovations 
were still a few weeks away from being finished but they had already 
completed most of the necessary repairs and her old room was now 
habitable. She avoided meeting Shinobu for the past three days now, 
yet, as the stars lit up the black canopy of the sky, all she could 
see were those eyes. Her eyes that were full of innocence and 
sweetness, eyes that she longed to see again.

&#147;I wonder&#133;are you looking at the sky as I am now?&#148; she asked no one in 
particular. &#147;Or do you lay in bed, sleeping, dreaming of a love found 
and love lost?&#148;

She missed Shinobu, she would not deny that. It was a sucking wound 
that was eating through her chest, this intentional avoidance. It was 
making her miserable through the day but she couldn&#146;t face her 
anymore. It was too confusing, too stressful, to maddening to have to 
imagine what would happen. She still wasn&#146;t sure about what Kana had 
told her and she couldn&#146;t sense whether it was the truth or not. She 
had no insight to the mind of the madman, a man her former kaisho had 
so often called evil incarnate. This uncertainty was worrying her 
endlessly and she could find peace of mind only when alone, amongst 
the stars that once, a long time ago it seemed to her, were thing she 
reached for with the optimism of childhood. So long ago, it felt to 
her, that she last even dreamt of anything. She sighed; the night was 
her home and her stronghold, where no one could touch her. The 
darkness was her friend and companion, her protector and sometimes, 
perhaps, it was even a lover.

&#147;And so I fade into darkness, lost and alone.&#148; She whispered to 
herself, quoting something she had read long ago. &#147;Like the moon of 
the night sky, I came from darkness and to darkness I shall return.&#148;

Kanako sat there, still and staring into the stars with a childlike 
innocence she thought she had lost long ago. Slowly, she stood up and 
wondered. Slowly, she proceeded into Hinata Sou&#146;s interior, passing 
through the various wooden beams and such that the team used for 
construction. It was still organized chaos but in a different way. 
This wasn&#146;t the organized chaos that Hinata Sou once carried with an 
amazing strength and almost human-like grace. As she moved her hand 
slowly through the wooden door of the kanrinrin&#146;s room, she closed her 
eyes with a passing fondness. She walked in, the new lights still 
weren&#146;t properly wired and it was the darkest room in the whole inn. 
She sat in the center, her legs tucked under her, her mind holding on 
to memories of the past. She crossed her arms, slowly embracing 
herself as the darkness seemed like they were wrapping around her too. 
Within the confines of her privacy in this place, she felt comfortable 
enough to let her heart out. In silence, a single tear fell down her 
cheek.

&#147;Why are you always alone? Why do you insist on doing this to 
yourself?&#148; she asked herself. &#147;You deserve your chance; you deserve 
happiness as much as anyone, maybe more than anyone else. If so, then 
why be like this? Why torment yourself, Kanako?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;d have loved to ask you the same question.&#148;

Kanako stopped and raised her head up a little, that voice was 
familiar. She let go of herself, knowing who was there with her in the 
darkness. The purple hair and eyes, that smile that showed nothing of 
what was inside, the way she leaned on the wall, it was Maehara Miho. 
Kanako stood up and straightened herself, there was a confrontation 
that was coming and she wanted to be ready for it. Miho kept that 
smile on her face, her hands in her pant&#146;s pockets, her long hair tied 
behind her head. Kanako couldn&#146;t understand that smile, a smile that 
in so many ways was like the smile she wore. The silence was deafening 
as neither of them moved from where they were, like two combatants 
measuring the other&#146;s level of skill before being the one to make the 
first move. Finally, Miho stopped leaning, stood by herself and walked 
closer, her eyes locked with Kanako&#146;s eyes. Her smile waned for a 
second before taking root again.

&#147;I&#146;d appreciate it if you knock the next time you do that.&#148; Kanako 
said. &#147;How did you get in, by the way?&#148;

&#147;I opened the door for her.&#148;

Shinobu stepped out of the shadows, with a slightly guilty smile. 
Kanako remembered that she gave a set of keys to Shinobu. She wondered 
whether she should regret that mistake. It was not that she wasn&#146;t 
happy to see Shinobu but she hated anyone catching her at a vulnerable 
moment. Still, as Shinobu stepped into the room with a grace and soft 
dignity such that only she could possibly pull it off, Kanako felt a 
little lighter. It made her heart race a little as Shinobu smiled and 
seemingly floated into the room, her attention was completely diverted 
from Miho&#146;s assessing looks. There was an air of disappointment in 
Shinobu&#146;s eyes, or were they a look of hurt? Was she hurt by Kanako&#146;s 
blatant avoidance? She certainly hoped not. She didn&#146;t understand why 
she was so worried about what Shinobu was thinking of her, it never 
really occurred before. Then, in a flash, she recalled that moment in 
the park.

With a single look, Shinobu remembered that exact same scene. How her 
body was wrapped in Kanako&#146;s caring embrace, the warmth, the way her 
heart raced as she saw those lips close in on her. She felt it, the 
same feeling that she had when Keitaro and her were in a similar 
situation. She had felt exactly the same way, her heart calling for a 
kiss. She didn&#146;t know if Kanako felt the same way in that situation at 
first but as those pale lips closed in on hers, the way she could 
almost hear Kanako&#146;s hear racing was too much to ignore. That warmth, 
that feeling that this person existed for her and only for her, it was 
overwhelming. Lost in the moment, she didn&#146;t give any resistance and 
instead, made her moves to help the kiss along. Then, they both got 
cut off. She stared at Kanako&#146;s eyes, which were barely visible in the 
darkness and all she could see was the same denied longing for that 
moment to come again, a longing that she could see in her own eyes 
whenever she looked in the mirror. That was why she was here, that was 
what she had come there to see. And now that she did, she felt 
relieved.

&#147;Isn&#146;t it unwise to leave Shinji-kun alone in your home like this?&#148;

&#147;We brought Shinji-kun along.&#148; Miho answered. &#147;He&#146;s in the sandbox 
near the woods.&#148;

&#147;Oh, I see.&#148;

&#147;Shinobu-chan&#133;&#148; Kanako walked out towards the windows, opening them 
and staring out once more into the stars. She could think of nothing 
else to do at the moment. &#147;&#133;have you ever seen anything so beautiful?&#148;

&#147;What?&#148; Shinobu asked as she walked closer.

&#148;I think I&#146;ll leave you two lovebirds alone.&#148; Miho smiled as she 
walked away. &#147;Have fun.&#148;

&#147;Look at the stars, Shinobu-chan. It&#146;s been so long since I last took 
a good look at the stars.&#148; Kanako said with a slight sentimentality. 
&#147;Haven&#146;t you ever tried it? Reaching out your hand, to see if you can 
take at least one from the night sky and keep it in your palm? I know 
I did, once upon a time.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re absolutely right. They are beautiful.&#148; Shinobu looked out into 
the sky, seeing the same majestic tapestry of light and darkness that 
Kanako did. She looked at Kanako, wondering what thoughts were running 
through that wicked web of a mind and a question came to mind. &#147;Why 
are you here?&#148;

&#147;This is the kanrinrin&#146;s room, Shinobu-chan. Once this place is fully 
renovated, this will be rightfully mine.&#148; Kanako answered her with a 
tinge of surprise.

&#147;No, it&#146;s not that. I mean&#133;why here? Why are you always in these dark 
places? I don&#146;t think I&#146;ve ever seen you in a place that was well lit 
aside from the park.&#148;

&#147;Walk with me.&#148; Kanako said as she took hold of Shinobu&#146;s hand.

The two of them walked outside the kanrinrin&#146;s room, towards the 
narrow hallway. Both of them found themselves lost in the memory of 
times that seemed so bygone now, of the longing to see people that 
they hadn&#146;t seen in too long a time. The ronin that they fell in love 
with, Urashima Keitaro and his wife, the red cockroach, as Kanako 
loved to call her, where were they now? Kaolla Su, was she on the 
throne of Molmol now? Kitsune, the fox of Hinata Sou, did that fox 
finally find a get rich quick scheme that worked? Or did she simply 
use Kentaro&#146;s money? And of Otohime Mutsumi, where was she now? 
Farming turtles in Okinawa? Or eating her fill of watermelons? They 
passed along the rooms of the former residents, one by one, 
remembering them with a passing fondness and a longing to see them 
once more. Then, they passed the room of the last of the residents, 
the heir to Shinmei Ryu, Aoyama Motoko.

&#147;Aoyama&#133;&#148; Kanako&#146;s voice turned most bitter. &#147;I haven&#146;t forgotten 
yet&#133;&#148;

&#147;Kanako-san&#133;&#148; that was all that Shinobu could mutter worriedly. 
Something about Kanako&#146;s change in expression made her look rather 
beastly. There was bad blood between those two, which Shinobu 
remembered with certainty. &#147;&#133;&#148;

Kanako walked on ahead, leaving Shinobu to look over the room a little 
more. Kanako soon wandered off alone on the outskirts of Hinata Sou, 
the wind was beginning to gather strength and was blowing harder than 
before. Once more, just like the old days, Kanako tied her hair with a 
red lace from her pocket. She always had that red lace with her; it 
was a gift from Keitaro, her beloved onii-san. She sat on the step 
closest to the doors of Hinata Sou, looking at the stars again. It did 
look like someone scattered a bottle of beads on a black cloth 
somewhat, Kanako thought, remembering the song. Within moments, 
Shinobu stepped out with two cups of hot, green tea. Sitting alongside 
Kanako, they kept their silence. Neither of them felt the need to 
speak, only the need to sit close to one another, to feel the other&#146;s 
presence. The winds were still blowing; the steam from the tea moving 
in the same direction and the two of them simply sat, looked at the 
beauty of the night sky and clung to hope.

Then, a figure walked up along the steps. They heard the steps which 
seemed to lack any semblance of gentleness. They felt the deep well of 
power of this person that was approaching them. Both Shinobu and 
Kanako noticed this and they both recognized who it was. It was 
unmistakable, the confident steps, the strength exemplified by her 
posture and stance, the ferocity that was subtly shown by the position 
of the hands. They could feel that power, a power they had come to 
know well years ago. They both knew what the other was thinking, they 
both suspected the same person. Years spent together in Hinata Sou 
were difficult, if not impossible to undo and in those years, they had 
come to know this feeling. They could almost smell it, ferocity and 
gentleness, inexorability and mercy, coldness and kindness, 
contrasting qualities that were found in only one person. As they 
confirmed with their eyes that this person was who they thought it 
was, they both reacted differently.

One was of hatred, absolute loathing and perhaps, even a little 
jealousy. She hated this person for everything that she was. It was no 
mere rivalry; this was much, much more. Gently, she put down her tea 
and stood up not to fight though, but to question and for the time 
being, tolerate. The new arrival stopped just a few steps away and she 
could feel the aura, that aura that had grown stronger and deadlier in 
the time since they last fought. The figure&#146;s own aura had become 
stronger in that time, the prospect of another battle brought a smile 
to that lovely face. The wind kept blowing relentlessly, one standing 
there in a timeless stance of defiance, the other in a stance of 
subtle power. Then, as both of them took a step forward, to settle 
their hatred once and for all, something interrupted them. It was the 
sound of a cup falling on the steps, shattering upon impact. The third 
among them wanted to run but couldn&#146;t.

&#147;Aoyama&#133;&#148; Kanako whispered with bitterness.

&#147;Motoko-chan&#133;&#148;</pre>
