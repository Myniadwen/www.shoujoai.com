<pre>	It was nearly 10:00 p.m., so Kitsune was surprised indeed to see 
Kaolla enter the living room.  &#147;What&#146;re you watching, Kitsune?&#148; the 
energetic girl chirped as she plopped down on the couch with a large 
bowl on her lap.
	&#147;Um, it&#146;s an American movie called&#133;Lady Hawke.  It&#146;s pretty 
good,&#148; the short-haired girl replied.
	&#147;Mind if I join you?&#148;  Su grabbed a handful of cheddar popcorn 
from the bowl and began munching.
	&#147;No, not at all, Kaolla-chan.  But it&#146;s pretty late, you know.&#148;
	&#147;Oh, I&#146;m not tired.&#148;
	&#147;Ha!  You&#146;re never tired.  But won&#146;t you wake Motoko-chan when 
you do go to bed?&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;m sleeping in my own room tonight.&#148;  The blonde girl&#146;s voice 
was tinged with hurt.  &#147;Motoko says she needs some time to herself.&#148;
	&#147;She does?&#148;  That was not believable to Kitsune.  Motoko was a 
proud swordswoman who rarely showed emotion or admitted to needing 
anything.  Asking for time alone was completely out of character for 
her.  And Kitsune was very curious.  True, it was Motoko&#146;s first day 
back at Hinata after a week of training, but something else was going 
on.  &#147;So&#133;did she say anything else?&#148; Kitsune prodded.
	&#147;No, she was in a big hurry to go to the bath.&#148;
	Now Kitsune was sure that something was up with her samurai 
friend.  Motoko had just been in the bath with all of them not an hour 
ago.  There had to be a reason she was going back so soon.  Kitsune 
searched her wicked mind.  Maybe Motoko had met someone during her 
training.  Kitsune shook her head.  Motoko with a man-that didn&#146;t 
sound right.  But what other explanation was there?  Or a better 
question: how had Motoko managed to sneak him into Hinata?
	Kitsune quickly thought of a way to check her theory.  She ran 
her hand through her short, light brown hair, trying to look casual.  
&#147;Hey, Kaolla, do you still have those IX goggles you invented a few 
months ago?&#148;
	&#147;Yeah, they&#146;re on my nightstand.&#148;
	&#147;Can I borrow them right quick?&#148;
	&#147;Sure, Kitsune.&#148;
	&#147;Thanks!  I&#146;ll be back in a minute, okay?&#148;
	&#147;Okay.  But if you don&#146;t hurry, all my popcorn will be gone,&#148; Su 
warned.  Kitsune was already out the door.
	&#147;Finally, some fun!  Some excitement!&#146; Kitsune rejoiced aloud as 
she jogged to Su&#146;s room.  She opened the door and stepped into 
Kaolla&#146;s private jungle.  After some hunting, she found the mattress 
that the nimble girl never used.
	&#147;-Nightstand is usually near a person&#146;s bed&#133;&#148; Kitsune muttered.  
She looked around but didn&#146;t find anything that resembled a 
nightstand.
	Wait a minute, she thought.  Why am I looking near her mattress?  
Su never uses it.  I should look near where she sleeps.  Hmm.  When 
she doesn&#146;t sleep in Motoko&#146;s room, she&#146;s usually&#133;in a tree!  Kitsune 
began looking around at the larger trees.  After a few minutes, she 
found a tree that seemed to have a boll with one or two strangely 
straight edges.  She scrambled up the tree.  Sure enough, there was a 
vine-covered nightstand.  &#147;Oh, Kaolla-chan,&#148; Kitsune chuckled, &#147;you 
have such a bizarre way of doing things.&#148;  She grabbed the powerful 
goggles and shimmied back down the tree.
	Now how to approach Motoko&#146;s room?  After a moment&#146;s 
consideration, the mischievous girl decided to try outside the 
building.  It was a warm, clear night, with an almost-full silver moon 
making the early dew sparkle.  Kitsune walked quietly around the 
building.  There was a light on in Motoko&#146;s room.  The shutters were 
closed.
	Kitsune fumbled with Kaolla&#146;s goggles until she located the &#147;on&#148; 
switch.  She raised the device to her eyes.  She saw only the night 
sky.
	The goggles were set too high.  Kitsune found a dial marked, 
&#147;lumen intensity.&#148;  She turned the knob slowly.  The stars were 
replaced with vague, fuzzy shapes.  Two of them were moving slightly.  
I was right, Kitsune&#146;s brain shouted triumphantly.  Now how do I focus 
these things?  She located another dial, this one marked, &#147;image 
sharpen.&#148;  She carefully turned the dial.
	Yes, they were two people.  She turned some more.
	The people seemed to be kissing!  She adjusted further.  Who was 
Motoko&#146;s new flame?
	Ah, sharp enough at last.  That was definitely Motoko.  And she 
was locking lips with&#133;
	&#133;Shinobu!
	The goggles dropped from Kitsune&#146;s nerveless fingers.  And onto 
her big toe.  &#147;Ow!&#148; she exclaimed, keeping her voice as low as 
possible.  She picked the heavy glasses up from the ground.  These 
weren&#146;t ordinary binoculars; it would take more than a short fall to 
break them.  When Su built something, she built it to last.  Still not 
believing what she&#146;d just seen, the brunette&#146;s trembling hands put the 
goggles up to her eyes.  She readjusted the focal control.
	Motoko was unbuttoning Shinobu&#146;s nightgown.  The girls were 
kissing passionately.  Shinobu eased away and spoke a few short 
syllables into Motoko&#146;s ear.  Those syllables might well have been, 
&#147;Aishiteru.&#148;
	Kitsune lowered the glasses quickly.  Though normally 
unflappable, she was embarrassed and a little ashamed of her snooping.  
Shinobu and Motoko were two of her closest friends.  She had no right 
to invade their privacy this way.  She&#146;d spied on Naru and Keitaro 
once, but that was different.  Keitaro and Naru shared a crush.  
Shinobu and Motoko&#133;even from this distance, even though she&#146;d only 
watched for a few seconds&#133;Kitsune could see that they were deeply in 
love.
	Envy flashed through Kitsune&#146;s brain, but guilt quickly squashed 
it.  Her relationships had been many and brief.  She&#146;d never actually 
felt love.  She shouldn&#146;t be jealous of her friends, she should be 
happy for them.  Still, she felt a dull ache in her heart when she 
thought of what she&#146;d seen.  When would it be her turn?
	She figured she ought to finish watching the movie.  With some 
effort, she climbed the tree and replaced Su&#146;s goggles on the 
nightstand.  She sighed and walked back to the living room.
	&#147;What did I miss, Kaolla-chan?&#148;
	She was answered only with deep, even breathing.  Kitsune strode 
softly over to the couch and looked down at Su.  She&#146;d fallen asleep 
in front of the TV, her hand still in the popcorn bowl.  She looked a 
little worried.
	I can&#146;t leave her to sleep here, Kitsune realized.  Her neck 
will ache all day tomorrow if she does.  I can&#146;t bring her to Motoko, 
she&#146;s-Kitsune giggled to herself-occupied.  I guess I&#146;d better get Su 
back to her room and let her sleep in one of her trees.  Kitsune 
walked to the front of the couch and bent to wake the smaller girl.
	But Kitsune found that she hadn&#146;t the heart to wake her.  The 
older girl pondered the dilemma.  She could carry Su to her room, but 
she&#146;d never be able to climb a tree with her.  &#147;Can&#146;t leave her here 
to get all sore and stiff,&#148; she mused.
	On impulse, Kitsune gently gathered Kaolla into her arms.  &#147;You 
can sleep on my mattress, Kaolla-chan,&#148; she whispered.  She carried 
the smaller girl to her room and laid her on the sheets.  Heavy 
sleeper, light body, Kitsune thought.  She removed Su&#146;s shoes and 
socks and covered her with a blanket.  She stood looking at her 
younger friend.  Su&#146;s face had been serene while she was in Kitsune&#146;s 
arms, but now she appeared troubled again.
	&#147;Kaolla is so bright and enthusiastic during the daytime; why 
does she look sad now?&#148; Kitsune wondered.  As carefully as she could, 
she untied the sky blue ribbon in Kaolla&#146;s hair.  Her shimmering, ash 
blonde locks rolled across the mattress and pillow.  The girl sighed 
and shifted under the blanket.
	&#147;Don&#146;t leave me,&#148; Kaolla mumbled through her dreams.
	Kitsune&#146;s heart transformed into a growing puddle of melting 
ice.  She knelt next to her young friend and stoked her hair softly.  
The dark-skinned girl&#146;s face sprouted a smile.  &#147;I won&#146;t leave, little 
angel,&#148; Kitsune said in a hushed voice.  The smile widened slightly.
	Kitsune kicked her sandals off her feet.  She changed into her 
nightshirt in record time and lay down next to Su on the mattress.  
She brushed Su&#146;s bangs from her forehead.
	She&#146;s so brave, Kitsune thought, out on her own in a foreign 
country.  She makes everyone around her happy.  She&#146;s so smart, too.  
Not to mention beautiful.  The way she talks is so endearing&#133;
	I&#146;ve never thought about a girl this way, Kitsune realized.  It 
must be an effect of what I observed tonight.  And my previous lack of 
satisfaction in a relationship.  Plus, I&#146;m very tired.  And I&#146;m lying 
next to a beautiful young lady.
	Kaolla snuggled up closer to Kitsune while she dreamed.  Kitsune 
felt an incredibly strong emotion grip her.  Was it love?  I wouldn&#146;t 
know, the older girl thought bitterly.  But I do know how much she 
means to me.  I know that I like spending time with her.  I know that 
she would rather sleep with someone than by herself.  I will be that 
someone.
	Maybe I do love her, Kitsune admitted silently.  I wish I knew 
for sure.  But if I can help it, she&#146;ll never feel sad while she 
sleeps-never again.
	Kitsune leaned forward and tenderly kissed Kaolla&#146;s tan cheek.  
&#147;You&#146;ll never be alone, my angel,&#148; she whispered.
	Kaolla cuddled gently nearer to Kitsune.  The brown-haired girl 
yawned and closed her eyes.  
	She fell asleep in moments, with a smile on her face.</pre>
