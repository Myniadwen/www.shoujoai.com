<h2>a <a href="../lovehina/index.html">Love Hina</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dragonhealer.html">Dragonhealer</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;I hate you, Keitaro Urashima!&quot;  Naru screamed out loud as she slammed 
the door and stomped downstairs.  She sat down on the couch beside 
Mutsumi.  No one else was in the dorm as they all were out shopping.  
It was a cool evening.  It became quiet again as Naru struggled to 
calm down.

Mutsumi looked at her troubled friend.  She reached out and gently 
placed a hand on Naru&#39;s shoulder.  Naru reacted a bit but calmed down 
as soon as she saw Mutsumi&#39;s pretty and smiling face.  &lt;Why do I 
always feel my anger disappear everytime I see her face?&gt;  Naru 
thought to herself as she moved in closer to Mutsumi&#39;s warm embrace.  
&quot;Naru, tell me what&#39;s wrong,&quot; Mutsumi said in her sweet voice as she 
held the younger girl who was shaking a little.

She took a deep breath and responded in a frustrated voice, &quot;Keitaro 
hasn&#39;t even tried to many anymore progress in our relationship.  
That&#39;s why I&#39;m so upset about it.  Why should I wait forever?  Why 
should he wait?&quot;

She began to sob.  As Mutsumi comforted her, she decided to try and 
fix Naru&#39;s problem.  &quot;Please don&#39;t cry anymore, Naru,&quot; she said as she 
gently planted a kiss on her forehead.  &quot;Just what is it that you are 
expecting?&quot;

Naru tried to stop sobbing, her breath coming in little hiccups.  
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;  she asked in a small voice.

&quot;Well, what are you expecting out of your relationship with Keitaro?  
What are you waiting for?&quot;  Mutsumi asked in a mother-like voice.  
Naru had never heard Mutsumi sound so wise before.  If she was this 
wise she would have already gotten into Tokyo University a long time 
ago. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;  she said as she wiped away her tears.  She 
looked up at Mutsumi&#39;s cute face and suddenly had a strange sensation.

&quot;I don&#39;t know.  Some kind of sign.  I&#39;m not wasting anymore time with 
him,&quot; Naru responded in an exasperated voice.  It hurt Mutsumi deep 
inside from seeing Naru so depressed.  When Naru sat up, Mutsumi 
slowly took her hand and locked her eyes with Naru&#39;s.  Naru hadn&#39;t 
felt this way since their first encounter alone with each other.  She 
knew Mutsumi had a strange habit of being intimate with people whom 
she met, regardless of their gender.  She had never seen the older 
girl look so serious before.

&quot;What?&quot;  Mutsumi continued to press on.  &quot;What exactly are you waiting 
to happen between the two of you?&quot;

Naru could suddenly feel all her blood rush to her cheeks.  &lt;I&#39;m 
getting a strange feeling about this.&gt;  Looking down, she responded, 
&quot;Anything, I guess.  We are at the same place we were a year ago.&quot;

Mutsumi thought for a moment.  Finally after a moment of silence she 
decided to shift gears.  &quot;Naru, how do you feel about me?&quot;

Shocked, Naru suddenly remembered when Mutsumi &quot;stole&quot; her first kiss 
that time.  &lt;What is she doing asking me a thing like that?  Then 
again, she probably could care less if we had a relationship and she 
wouldn&#39;t even know it.&gt;  She feigned a laugh.  &quot;You can be really 
funny sometimes.&quot;

To her surprise, Mutsumi did not laugh along with her.  Naru&#39;s heart 
began beating fast when she noticed Mutsumi&#39;s cheeks turning red.  
&quot;What do you mean?  I asked because.....what do you mean by that?&quot;

Naru began to panic, terrified that Mutsumi was going to faint like 
she always did.  She gently held Mutsumi&#39;s shoulders and pushed her 
against the back of the couch.  &quot;Mutsumi, please.......I don&#39;t want 
you to have another anemia....I....&quot; she was surprised that Mutsumi 
was smiling.  &quot;It&#39;s okay, Naru, I&#39;m fine, really.&quot;

Naru watched in awe as Mutsumi gently hoisted herself on the couch.  
Naru took a deep breath before responding, &quot;We&#39;re both girls, you 
know.&quot;

Mutsumi stared at her, hurt.  &quot;What...what are you getting at?  I just 
can&#39;t stand seeing you hurt.  I can&#39;t believe Keitaro would ever try 
to hurt you, but it looks like he did.  I care about you, Naru, a lot.  
I thought he would finally see what a wonderful person you are.  
You&#39;re very kind and sweet.&quot;

Naru was stunned.  She never imagined Mutsumi would try to make 
advances towards her.   She tried shaking it off as a joke.  &quot;Okay?  
But you don&#39;t have to joke about it.&quot;  She then realized she had said 
the wrong thing.

The older girl was hurt.  Her smile disappeared.  &quot;What are you 
talking about, Naru?  I&#39;m not joking around.   Seeing you hurt is 
hurting me even more,&quot; she said in a hurt voice.

Desparately Naru struggled to think of a solution.  &quot;It&#39;s okay.  It&#39;ll 
work out.&quot;

&quot;But what if it doesn&#39;t?  If Keitaro still doesn&#39;t hurry up with you 
then you&#39;ll be even more depressed.  If only there was something I 
could do to make you feel better...&quot;

&quot;Stop worrying, Mutsumi,&quot; Naru protested with a forced smile.  
&quot;Keitaro did get into Tokyo University so he can&#39;t be that stupid.&quot;

Mutsumi shook a little.  She had a funny feeling in her stomach.  She 
looked at Naru and realized how beautiful she was.  She leaned in 
closer and said, &quot;Naru....you&#39;re so beautiful.....I know you like 
Keitaro but......can I kiss you?&quot;

&quot;Wha- wha- wha?!&quot;  a shocked Naru thought what she heard was 
incorrect.  Mutsumi moved in until her face was inches away from 
Naru&#39;s.  &lt;She smells so good....&gt; Naru thought to herself.  &quot;Naru, I 
like you a lot.  Even though we&#39;re both third-year drifters, you&#39;re 
stronger and more persistent than I am.  You&#39;re more determined.  You 
gave me so many great memories since I met you and Keitaro.  I feel 
you are suffering so much, and it hurts me deeply.  Naru, if Keitaro 
still wants you, he can make his move, but if not, you can take a 
chance on me.  How do you feel about me, Naru?&quot;

Naru began to back up.  &quot;Mutsumi, please......stop it.....you&#39;re 
scaring me.&quot; Mutsumi could feel her heart being stabbed.  Tears filled 
her eyes.  Naru noticed and began to feel extremely guilty.  &quot;Naru, I 
know I shouldn&#39;t have said that, but I can&#39;t help it.  I didn&#39;t mean 
to scare you.  It&#39;s just that you&#39;re so impatient with Keitaro, I 
thought I could make you feel better.  He&#39;s so busy with Tokyo 
University that he barely has enough time to be with you.   You still 
have me, your friend.  I&#39;m sitting right next to you.&quot;

Naru could not believe what she was hearing.  She could feel her heart 
racing, her body sweating and feeling like jelly.  Mutsumi looks at 
her.  Naru had never seen her so sad before.  &lt;How could I do that to 
her?  She&#39;s always been so kind and caring to me, even when I was 
feeling down.  She may be clumsy and weak, but she&#39;s so pure-hearted 
and she always means well.  And what did I just do?  I reject her just 
like that!&gt;  Naru scolded herself.  Mutsumi looked at Naru and 
whispered, &quot;You long for a chance at at love and sex, don&#39;t you?  I 
know you do.  What&#39;s wrong with me, Naru?  Why are you afraid of me?&quot;

Horrified, Naru quickly responded, &quot;No, Mutsumi!  I could never be 
afraid of you!  I&#39;m not, I&#39;m not afraid b.....but.....&quot;

&quot;But what?  Don&#39;t be scared.  I would never hurt you,&quot; she spoke 
softly as she brought up a hand to touch Naru&#39;s face.

&quot;I know, but....&quot;  Naru could feel herself surrendering to Mutsumi&#39;s 
touch and presence.

&quot;We can do it now or tonight if you want.  No one has to know.  
Please, Naru.  I can&#39;t stand seeing you hurt anymore.  I......I love 
you.&quot;

&quot;If we did, then.......&quot;

&quot;What then?  What would happen that you are so afraid of?  It&#39;s me, 
Naru.  I&#39;m not a stranger.  You should know me better by now.  You&#39;re 
denying your desire to be with me.  I know you are.&quot;

A thought suddenly occured to Naru.  &quot;Hey......Mutsumi.....by any 
chance.....Kitsune didn&#39;t put you up to this......did she?&quot;  she asked 
with caution in her voice.  Mutsumi was surprised.   &quot;Why, Naru 
Narusegawa.  You of all people ougtht to know that I am NOT the kind 
of person who would allow anyone to manipulate me.&quot;

Naru immediately felt ashamed.  She looked down and sighed.  &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, Mutsumi...it&#39;s just that......&quot;

But before she could continue Mutsumi held Naru&#39;s shoulders and kissed 
her passionately.  &quot;Stop, please, Mutsumi,&quot; she could feel pleasure 
surging through her body.  &quot;You&#39;re making me......please.....oh.&quot;

Mutsumi kept kissing her, feeling up her body.  She whispered in her 
ear, &quot;You like it, don&#39;t you?  I know you do.&quot;

Naru struggled to resist until Mutsumi touched a more pleasurable 
spot.  Oh yes....right now.....&quot; Naru moaned.  She began to lose 
control of herself.

Mutsumi stopped and whispered, &quot;Naru, if you want to go that far, not 
in here, but in your room.&quot;

Naru sat on the bed, practically in a trance from all the pleasure she 
received and looked at Mutsumi with needy eyes.  It was half past 
nine.  Mutsumi locked the door, closed the blinds and sat on the bed.  
&quot;First, we need to take off our clothes,&quot; she said calmy with a smile.  
Soon both were naked.  Both blushed furiously after seeing each 
other&#39;s naked body.  Mutsumi kissed Naru passionately.  &quot;I&#39;m so glad I 
can do this with you, Naru,&quot; she whispered in between kisses, moving 
on to her neck.

Naru felt more pleasure and gladly welcomed it.  &quot;Yes, please don&#39;t 
stop, Mutsumi....I need more......&quot; she moaned.  &quot;I&#39;ll give you what 
Keitaro could never give,&quot; Mutsumi said mysteriously as she lowered 
her head and licked at her vagina.  She found Naru&#39;s clitoris and 
sucked on it.  Naru raised her head and let out a passionate moan.  
Intense pleasure caused her to moan even louder in pleasure.

&quot;Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.......please.......&quot; her body produced cum.  Mutsumi 
licked up every drop.  &quot;You have a very sweet taste.&quot;  She kissed Naru 
hard, letting her taste herself this time, massaging her breast.  
Mutsumi sat on her knees and grinded her hips and vagina hard against 
Naru&#39;s.  &quot;Yes-yes-yes!&quot;  Naru moaned.  Mutsumi found herself moaning 
as well as both girls grinded and bumped their vaginas together, 
triggering orgasms in each other.  They let out passionate moans.  
&quot;Oh, Mutsumi!  Oh yes, that feels so good!&quot;  Naru suddenly lost 
herself in this type of heaven.

Both girls began to sweat profusely.  &quot;Naru!   Oh God!  Yes!  Don&#39;t 
stop!&quot;  Naru grinded even faster.  &quot;Yes!  More!  Oh, Naru!&quot;

&quot;Mutsumi!  It feels too good!&quot;  They continued to bump and grind, 
triggering more orgasms and producing more cum, wetting the bed.  The 
pleasure was so strong that they could barely say anything else.

Finally they both collapsed on the bed, breathing and panting heavily, 
their bodies shining in sweat, their hair matted to their foreheads, 
their minds reeling.  Mutsumi struggled to embrace Naru as they lay 
side by side.  Naru kissed Mutsumi.  She stare at each other&#39;s eyes.  
Naru began to cry.  &quot;Oh, Mutsumi.......I.......that was.....the most 
incredible experience I have ever had,&quot; she said with a smile.

Mutsumi smiled back, her breathing returning to normal. &quot;I&#39;m glad you 
liked it, Naru. I just wanted to see your beautiful smile once again.&quot;

Naru stood silent as she gathered her thoughts.  &quot;You knew that would 
make me feel better.  Why did I have to do this with you before 
Keitaro?&quot;  she mused.  Mutsumi laughed.  &quot;Your first kiss was with me, 
remember?&quot;

Naru nodded her head.  &quot;Hey, Mutsumi,&quot; she said quietly.  &quot;Next time 
Keitaro refuses to spend time with me, can we do this again?&quot;

Mutsumi&#39;s only response was a deeper kiss.   When it was over Naru 
moved in closer inside her older friend&#39;s embrace.   With her last bit 
of strength Naru covered themselves with her sheet before the two 
girls fell asleep almost immediately.
