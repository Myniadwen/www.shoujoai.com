<pre>Shinobu twirled a few strands of Motoko&#146;s long black hair around her 
finger.  She and her lover were sprawled on the long sofa in the 
living room of their Kyoto apartment, watching a movie called 
&#147;Willow.&#148;  &#147;That warrior girl reminds me of you, Toko-chan,&#148; she 
purred.  &#147;But you are prettier and a stronger fighter.&#148;

&#147;You say such sweet things,&#148; Motoko sighed.  She cuddled deeper into 
the blue-haired girl&#146;s lap.

&#147;It&#146;s easy; they are all true.

&#147;Say, Toko-chan, can you keep the last weekend of this month free?&#148;

&#147;With a little rearranging, I can.  Why?&#148;

&#147;I have somewhere I&#146;d like to take you,&#148; Shinobu answered.

&#147;Really?&#148; Motoko said.  &#147;Where might that be?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s a secret,&#148; Shinobu giggled.

Motoko looked up, her shining brown eyes locking onto Shinobu&#146;s deep 
purple eyes.  &#147;So mysterious,&#148; she said, her voice low and sexy.  She 
lightly ran one slender finger along Shinobu&#146;s smooth arm.  &#147;You 
wouldn&#146;t keep a secret from me, would you?&#148;

Shinobu&#146;s resistance to Motoko&#146;s sensual touch held up for nearly two 
seconds-much longer than usual.  &#147;Okay!  It&#146;s an animation festival!  
Aw, blast it.  Toko-chan, are you ever going to let me surprise you?&#148;

&#147;Nope, I never will let you.  So if you really want to surprise me, 
you&#146;ll have to be careful about it,&#148; Motoko advised.

Oh, I will surprise you, Shinobu thought with a concealed grin.  When 
it counts.

Shinobu had been busy with preparations for the festival for several 
months now; but it was closer than ever, consequently, she was busier 
than ever.  She also had the most important plan of her life to deal 
with.  As for Motoko, she was always busy.  She had taken sole 
responsibility for the Shinmei dojo recently.  She trained her 
students and of course she kept going with her own training.  Shinobu 
was glad that Motoko was the mistress of the school and wanted her to 
do her best, but at one point last week, she&#146;d finally asked Motoko if 
she was tired.

&#147;Yes, a little,&#148; the samurai had replied.

Then and there, Shinobu had resolved to help Motoko get at least some 
relaxation.  &#147;A little&#148; from Motoko was enough to put anyone else in 
an exhausted coma.

Shinobu had to admit that she was a tad run down herself.  Her job as 
a chef in the restaurant of a large four-star hotel kept her fairly 
busy.  She was drawing a set of pictures that she would auction for 
charity as well.  In addition, she was looking into buying a small 
building and some equipment to possibly open a kitchen of her own.  
Her largest concern was taking care of her beloved Motoko; the anime 
festival was a part of that.

The weeks sped past.  On Friday evening, Shinobu took off from work 
early and had dinner ready in the dining room when Motoko came back 
from the dojo.  The black-haired woman had brought red wine with her, 
surprising Shinobu.  They ate and bantered casually.  Motoko noticed 
that Shinobu was even more cheerful than she normally was.

&#147;Okay, spill it, Shinobu-chan.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know what you mean, Toko-chan.&#148;

&#147;Oh yes you do.&#148;  Motoko sipped her wine and leveled an inquisitive 
stare at her young lover.  &#147;You&#146;ve never been able to keep anything 
from me.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s nothing, seriously,&#148; the blue-haired woman answered.  Her 
chuckling betrayed her.

Motoko leaned across the table and laid her hand over Shinobu&#146;s, 
grasping and lifting it gently.  The tall warrior put the very tip of 
Shinobu&#146;s dainty pinky finger between her lips-

&#147;-You win!  I&#146;ve been promoted to supervising chef!&#148; Shinobu 
practically shouted.  Her face fell.  &#147;You&#146;re so mean, Toko-chan; I 
wanted to tell you tomorrow.&#148;

&#147;Oh, I&#146;ll make it up to you, darling,&#148; Motoko cooed.  &#147;I&#146;m so proud of 
you!  I&#146;ve never heard of anyone your age becoming a supervisor at 
such a classy establishment.&#148;

&#147;Arigatou, but it&#146;s no big deal,&#148; Shinobu said with a slight blush.  
&#147;Being the head of a samurai order is much more impressive.

&#147;Still, I may be able to get a little more time off to spend with my 
beautiful girlfriend.

&#147;And speaking of that, are you ready to go to the festival?&#148;

Motoko was blushing deeply.  &#147;Hai, I&#146;m ready and eager,&#148; she replied.  
&#147;When are we leaving?&#148;

&#147;At 0830, if it&#146;s all right.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll get to sleep in!  You bet it&#146;s a deal.&#148;

After the meal, Motoko put on a classical music album that featured 
lovely panpipes.  Shinobu lit two sticks of jasmine incense.  Motoko 
stood, relaxed, in the center of the thick rug and closed her eyes.

Shinobu slowly and carefully removed the strong fighter&#146;s training 
pants and shirt, then her chemise, then her panties.  She took hold of 
Motoko&#146;s warm hand and guided her to the mattress, where Motoko lay 
face down.  Shinobu pulled Motoko&#146;s socks from her feet, leaving her 
completely naked.  The blue-haired girl deliberately poured juniper 
massage oil over the length of Motoko&#146;s powerful body.  The sheen of 
the samurai&#146;s skin was nearly a physical force, delaying the skilled 
chef&#146;s hands.  Shinobu gently touched Motoko&#146;s graceful neck.

&#147;Relax, my gorgeous lover,&#148; she whispered, causing the woman beneath 
her to shiver.  Shinobu worked with wonderful precision and delicacy, 
freeing Motoko of her stress, her worries, and her physical weariness.  
Her healing fingers and palms released the samurai&#146;s tension.  Her 
loving touch soothed every part of Motoko&#146;s tired body, leaving her 
feeling refreshed and content.

&#147;Feeling better?&#148; Shinobu asked quietly.

Motoko turned over and gazed into the small woman&#146;s purple eyes with 
pure love.  &#147;Aishiteru, Shinobu.&#148;

&#147;Aishiteru, Toko-chan.&#148;

The warrior&#146;s strong arms pulled Shinobu into a tight embrace.  The 
couple kissed very gently, conveying their love for each other with 
soft, damp lips.  Together, they removed Shinobu&#146;s clothing and 
embraced once more.  Their lovemaking was slow, wordless, and 
fulfilling.  It lasted for over an hour.  Then they rose, took towels, 
and soaked in a luxurious bath.  They cleansed themselves in near 
silence.

At length, they returned to the bedroom and lay down for the night.

&#147;If it wasn&#146;t for you, Shinobu-chan, I would&#146;ve gone insane ages ago.  
You saved me.  I need you more than anything else.&#148;

As she did every night they were together, Shinobu rested her arm 
across Motoko&#146;s waist.  She brushed a few strands of hair away from 
Motoko&#146;s face.  &#147;I need you, Toko-chan.  I want you, I need you, and 
best of all, I have you.&#148;

Their dreams began a few minutes later, and they were sweet indeed.

The next morning, the two women drove to the spacious festival site.  
Shinobu had wanted to attend as her favorite manga character, but 
Motoko objected, saying that she was infinitely more kawaii as 
herself.  At Shinobu&#146;s insistence, their first stop was the main 
concession stand.  The petite woman tried to look in on the operation 
without being noticed-

&#147;Maehara-sensei!&#148; a girl called out.

&#147;I&#146;ve got such terrible luck,&#148; Shinobu grumbled as she put a hand to 
her face.

&#147;Shinobu-chan?  Um, what&#146;s going on?&#148; Motoko asked.

A girl of about 18 or 19 with short brown hair and small, wire-framed 
glasses skipped toward them.  &#147;Everything&#146;s going smoothly, 
Maehara-sensei, thanks to your help.  You were-&#147;

&#147;-Please don&#146;t call me that; we&#146;re the same age.  Shinobu will do.&#148;  
She turned quickly to Motoko.  &#147;Gomen ne, Toko-chan, I should have 
told you that I played an instrumental role in planning the food 
service here.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t be silly,&#148; Motoko laughed.  &#147;I&#146;d just like to know where you 
found the time.&#148;

&#147;Oh, she comes in during-&#147;

&#147;-Watch it, those nikumans are about to fall!&#148; Shinobu interrupted 
forcefully, making the young lady scurry back behind the counter.  
&#147;Er, you see,&#148; she told Motoko, &#147;I only work five days a week, not six 
like you.&#148;

&#147;Well yes, that&#146;s true.  But on that one day, you do several extra 
things,&#148; Motoko pointed out.

&#147;I can do a lot while you&#146;re away at training,&#148; Shinobu smirked.

&#147;Really?&#148; the tall woman said with growing respect and suspicion.

&#147;Anyway, I&#146;ll introduce you to Meili properly and make sure things are 
going well and then we need to start having fun.&#148;

And they did.  They had a blast.  They went to early screenings of 
several new anime series.  They watched a costume contest.  A local 
mangaka sketched them.  (&#147;You draw us better,&#148; Motoko had remarked.)  
They played a few new videogames.  They ate good food.  They even saw 
a live band performance.

&#147;These things are great fun!&#148; Motoko said to Shinobu.  &#147;I&#146;m glad you 
asked me to go with you.&#148;

&#147;My pleasure,&#148; Shinobu said, failing to stifle a yawn.

&#147;Oh, my poor Shinobu-chan, you&#146;re tired, aren&#146;t you?&#148;

&#147;Just a little.&#148;

&#147;Come on, I&#146;ll drive us home.&#148;

&#147;But you hate driving!&#148;

&#147;I insist.&#148;

Shinobu was grateful for the favor; she really was much more tired 
than she&#146;d let on to Motoko.  Almost as soon as they got into the car, 
the blue-haired girl laid her head on the young samurai&#146;s legs.  She 
struggled against sleep but it was no use.  She was breathing deeply 
and traveling through dreams a few minutes into the ride.  Motoko 
noticed immediately.  She smiled and ran her fingers through the 
girl&#146;s fine blue hair.  &#147;It&#146;s my turn to take care of you, my love,&#148; 
she whispered.

Shinobu half-woke just as the car stopped at their apartment building.  
&#147;Are we there?&#148; she asked blearily.

&#147;Hai,&#148; Motoko confirmed.  &#147;Don&#146;t get up.  I&#146;ve got you.&#148;  The samurai 
gathered her young lover tenderly into her arms.  She walked to their 
room, carrying Shinobu easily.  Once she set the sleeping woman on the 
mattress, she realized how tired she was herself.  She took off 
Shinobu&#146;s shoes and socks, then her own socks, and lay on the soft 
bed, covering herself and her girlfriend with a light cotton blanket.  
Motoko fell asleep almost at once.

&#147;Rise and shine!&#148; Shinobu said energetically the next morning.  
&#147;Here&#146;s your breakfast.&#148;

The two young women ate, bathed, and dressed, talking happily all the 
while.  &#147;This isn&#146;t the first time you&#146;ve gone to one of these things, 
is it?&#148; Motoko asked.

&#147;No.  I used to go all the time.  This particular convention is the 
biggest in the area.  I had to take you to this one.  Only the best 
for you.&#148;

&#147;I appreciate it,&#148; Motoko said thoughtfully.  &#147;I can already see how 
these festivals could become addictive.&#148;

&#147;We&#146;ve still got more to see and do today,&#148; Shinobu reminded.  &#147;We 
didn&#146;t get to all of it yesterday.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m ready!&#148;

&#147;Excellent.&#148;

They arrived only slightly later than they had the day before.  
Shinobu took the lead and they set off for the dealers&#146; tables first.  
Motoko was astounded by the volume and variety of items for sale.  She 
knew two or three of Shinobu&#146;s favorite animes, but most things she 
pointed out Shinobu already owned.  &#147;I had not idea you were such a 
fan girl,&#148; Motoko commented wryly as they passed a display of plushies 
that Shinobu had.

&#147;Hmph,&#148; the shorter girl responded.  Just then, they saw a display of 
weapons and armor.  Motoko gasped.  &#147;You&#146;re drooling, dear,&#148; Shinobu 
teased.  &#147;I guess we&#146;ve both got our weaknesses, ne?&#148;

Motoko sweatdropped.

From the dealers&#146; rooms, they went back to the screening rooms to 
catch a few new episodes of an action-packed anime.  Then Shinobu 
suggested visiting the local artists&#146; hall of work.  Motoko was 
surprised that there were so many different styles that the artists 
used.  She bought two of the drawings, intending to hang them on the 
walls of her office at the dojo.

&#147;The charity auction is going to start soon,&#148; the young chef informed 
her companion.  &#147;It&#146;s in the room right next to this one and I&#146;m kind 
of anxious to see it.&#148;

&#147;Let&#146;s go then,&#148; Motoko said, joining hands with Shinobu.

Many of the drawings and paintings were very good.  Eventually, the 
auctioneer&#146;s assistant held up a drawing that took Motoko&#146;s breath 
away.  &#147;Sugoi,&#148; she murmured.  &#147;Isn&#146;t that beautiful?&#148;  It was a scene 
where two girls of about seven or eight were running hand-in-hand 
through a lily-spangled meadow.

&#147;Oh, it&#146;s pretty good,&#148; Shinobu said, turning pink.

&#147;&#146;Field of Happiness,&#146; by Maehara Shinobu,&#148; the auctioneer called.  
&#147;Let&#146;s start the bidding at 2500 yen.&#148;

&#147;You donated that piece!&#148; Motoko said with stars in her eyes.  &#147;You&#146;re 
brilliant, Shinobu-chan.  I should&#146;ve recognized the style right 
off-I&#146;ve seen plenty of your drawings of me and of us together.&#148;  
Shinobu blushed until she was red as an apple.

When the auction was finished, the young ladies had a late lunch and 
went back to the game room.

It was evening when Shinobu&#146;s watch alarm beeped.  &#147;They&#146;re about to 
have the closing ceremony,&#148; the blue-haired woman said.  &#147;Let&#146;s go; we 
shouldn&#146;t miss it.&#148;

Awards came first, including best costumes, best artist, and many 
other categories.  Then there were several performances.  Those 
involved gave it their all; the songs were touching and the skits were 
hilarious.  Then the director of the festival picked up the microphone 
and started calling people up to the stage to thank them.

&#147;I also have to thank an extremely sweet and talented young woman who 
helped a lot with the planning and layout of the convention.  She was 
also involved in the concessions and the banquet.  Maehara-san, would 
you come up here, please?&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t get too comfortable,&#148; Shinobu giggled to Motoko as she stood.  
She strode calmly up to the stage.

&#147;I have to thank you, sir,&#148; Shinobu told the director, &#147;for another 
terrific festival.  I am glad that I could help.  I did this for 
myself, for all of you, but especially for one person.  &#147;Toko-chan, 
would you please come here?&#148;  She beckoned.

Motoko felt searing heat beneath her cheeks as she joined Shinobu 
onstage.

&#147;If I did anything well, this woman deserves as much credit as I do,&#148; 
Shinobu announced.  &#147;She inspires me.  She supports me.  I do my best 
for her.&#148;

Suddenly, Motoko noticed Shinobu holding a small box.  The blue-haired 
woman dropped to one knee and lightly grasped the samurai&#146;s hand with 
her free hand.  She held the open box toward her black-haired lover, 
displaying a diamond ring.

&#147;Aishiteru, Aoyama Motoko.  Will you marry me?&#148;

Joyous tears ran down Motoko&#146;s cheeks.  &#147;Yes.  There&#146;s nothing I would 
rather do.&#148;  She helped Shinobu to her feet.  The couple kissed and 
most of the audience applauded wildly.  Motoko slipped the ring onto 
her finger.

When the closing ceremony ended a few minutes later, Motoko and 
Shinobu were swamped with well-wishers.

&#147;-talk about courage!&#148;

&#147;-such beautiful love-&#147;

&#147;-hope for only the best for you both-&#147;

&#147;That was so romantic-&#147;

&#147;-an adorable couple.&#148;

&#147;Congratulations!&#148; two familiar voices sang out.

&#147;Kaolla-chan!  Kitsune-san!&#148; Shinobu and Motoko exclaimed in unison.  
Hugs were freely exchanged between the four excited, happy women.

&#147;Wow,&#148; Kaolla said.  &#147;I knew that you two were serious, but this&#133;it&#146;s 
wonderful!&#148;

Kitsune took Shinobu aside hastily.  &#147;I figured that there was a 
reason you were hinting during your phone call that Kaolla and I 
should be here,&#148; the brown-haired woman said in a low voice.

Shinobu spoke conspiratorially.  &#147;Of course you caught that.  When do 
you propose to Su?&#148;

Kitsune&#146;s face turned scarlet.  &#147;We&#146;ll-we&#146;ll see&#133;&#148; she stammered.

It was more than an hour before they managed to break away from all 
the interested people and head for home.

&#147;My fondest wish has come true,&#148; Shinobu said while Motoko locked 
their apartment door.  &#147;It&#146;s been a perfect day.  Now we ought to get 
some sleep, my love, because-&#147;

Motoko cut off Shinobu&#146;s sentence with a deep kiss.  She grabbed the 
hem of the shorter woman&#146;s dress and pulled it up and over her head.  
&#147;I&#146;d say that you&#146;ve made my dreams come true, but I would be lying,&#148; 
she murmured into Shinobu&#146;s ear as she continued undressing her.  
&#147;You&#146;re much better than all the good dreams I&#146;ve ever had.  Today, 
you did the bravest, most romantic thing I&#146;ll ever see.  And there&#146;s 
also the matter of this enormous diamond on my finger&#133;gomen ne, 
Shinobu-chan, but there will be no sleep for you tonight.  In fact, 
you might never sleep again!&#148;

The hours until sunrise flew by in a haze of ecstatic lovemaking.  
Motoko was sending Shinobu to bliss yet again when her alarm clock 
began buzzing.

With reluctance that bordered on physical pain, the two women finally 
parted to begin their day.  Neither Shinobu nor Motoko felt tired 
during their work, just a little distracted and totally in love.  The 
time seemed like nothing while each young woman was on the other&#146;s 
mind.  As soon as Shinobu finished at the restaurant, she raced home 
and prepared a romantic dinner for herself and Motoko.

&#147;I&#146;m home, my fianc&eacute;e!&#148; Motoko greeted as she stepped through the 
apartment door.

&#147;I&#146;m glad to see you, my fianc&eacute;e!&#148; Shinobu responded, rushing forward 
to kiss the tall warrior.  &#147;Dinner is nearly ready.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll put on some music then,&#148; Motoko offered.

The two ladies discussed their future while they ate.  &#147;I do have a 
small problem,&#148; Motoko confessed.  &#147;Traditionally, the head of the 
Shinmei School has been single.  My sister and I are the only Aoyamas 
left, however; and my sister is already married.&#148;

&#147;What will you do?&#148; Shinobu asked with a small frown.

&#147;Hey now, don&#146;t you worry!  Ever!  I love you.  You come before 
everything else.  I will simply consult with my sister, that&#146;s all,&#148; 
Motoko said.

&#147;But the school-&#147;

&#147;-There are lots of schools.  There is only one woman I love and one 
woman who loves me.  If I have to choose, I choose you.  It&#146;s no 
contest!  But I won&#146;t have to choose.  Trust me.&#148;

Shinobu smiled.  &#147;I do trust you.  When are you going to talk to your 
sister?&#148;

&#147;On Sunday,&#148; the fighter answered.

&#147;I will go with you.&#148;

That Sunday morning, Shinobu was a little nervous as she and her 
fianc&eacute;e prepared to visit the elder Aoyama.  She straightened the bow 
in Motoko&#146;s hair.  &#147;You look every centimeter a samurai,&#148; Shinobu 
chirped, &#147;the most beautiful samurai anyone&#146;s ever seen.&#148;

&#147;You look exquisite,&#148; Motoko responded.  &#147;Be calm; I&#146;m sure she&#146;ll 
love you.&#148;  The couple removed their shoes and stepped into Motoko&#146;s 
sister&#146;s house.

&#147;It&#146;s been a while, but luckily not too long,&#148; the dark-haired woman 
at the end of the hallway said.  &#147;I&#146;m glad that you came for a visit, 
little sister.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m very happy to see you, big sister!&#148; Motoko cried, clasping the 
slightly taller woman in a bear hug.  &#147;I regret that I am coming to 
you with a problem.&#148;

&#147;For someone who has a problem, you sure seem happy,&#148; the older lady 
remarked as she raised an eyebrow.

&#147;The cause of my happiness is also the cause of the dilemma.  I&#146;m 
getting married, you see.&#148;

&#147;Not this again,&#148; Motoko&#146;s sister snickered.

&#147;I&#146;m serious this time,&#148; Motoko stated evenly.

&#147;Hmm&#133;well, I need to see trouble before I believe it.&#148;

Motoko held out her hand, displaying the diamond engagement ring.  Her 
sister gasped.

&#147;Wow.  Whoever gave you this has money.  I trust that is not your 
reason?&#148;

&#147;Of course not.&#148;

&#147;Good!  But why didn&#146;t he come here with you?&#148;

&#147;She did.&#148;

&#147;How are you, um, Shinobu, right?  Why did you come in the place of-&#147; 
Suddenly, the truth dawned on the warrior.

&#147;We would like your blessing,&#148; Shinobu said with a respectful bow.

&#147;B-but&#133;this is a joke, right?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s no joke!&#148; Motoko yelled with a flash of anger.  &#147;Why would I, 
the mistress of Shinmei School, be pulling some sophomoric prank?  I 
love this woman!&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t get upset, Toko-chan,&#148; Shinobu said soothingly.  She laid her 
hand on Motoko&#146;s shoulder.  She looked her fianc&eacute;e&#146;s sister in the 
eye.  &#147;I hope you will-&#147;

&#147;-Shut up, baka,&#148; the older woman said coldly.

&#147;Take that back,&#148; Motoko grated.  &#147;Now.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;ve disgraced Shinmei-&#147;

&#147;-Stop it!&#148; Shinobu said vehemently, running from Motoko&#146;s side to get 
between the two warrior women.  &#147;Did Motoko do this to you before you 
got married?&#148;

&#147;I married a man!&#148;

&#147;A man who loves you, right?  I love Motoko.  How is it any different?  
Let&#146;s talk this over, please.&#148;

&#147;To hell with talk.  I challenge you to a duel.&#148;

&#147;I won&#146;t allow that!&#148; Motoko exclaimed.  &#147;What the matter with you, 
anyway?  Of course you&#146;d win, just as Shinobu would handily defeat you 
in a cooking contest.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m the elder sister; I have issued a challenge to her suitor.&#148;

&#147;Why don&#146;t you-&#147;

&#147;-What are the terms?&#148; Shinobu asked earnestly.

&#147;Blade versus blade.  Winner draws first blood.  Setting will be my 
outdoor arena, here.&#148;

&#147;The stakes?&#148;

&#147;Shinobu, don&#146;t do this,&#148; Motoko pleaded.

&#147;I should at least listen,&#148; the petite woman answered.  &#147;What are the 
stakes?&#148;

&#147;If you win, you wed Motoko with my blessing.  If you lose, there is 
no marriage.&#148;

&#147;Quit trying to bully my fianc&eacute;e,&#148; Motoko ordered.  &#147;If you want a 
fight, fight me.&#148;

&#147;You got lucky last time, thanks to the cursed Hina sword.  I won&#146;t 
hold back this time.  If I fight you, it is to the death.&#148;

&#147;I accept your challenge,&#148; Shinobu stated quietly.

&#147;No!  Shinobu!&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s too late, Motoko; she accepted.&#148;

&#147;I accepted for her sake and mine,&#148; Shinobu stated.  &#147;I won&#146;t be the 
reason she kills her sister.

&#147;But I must say that I overestimated your wisdom.  You are trying to 
fight love.  You cannot beat that, no matter how strong or skillful 
you are.

&#147;Motoko and I came here to look after the fate of the Shinmei School.  
I hope that once this is over, we can discuss that.&#148;

&#147;You are eloquent,&#148; the elder Aoyama said with a trace of admiration.  
&#147;You will fight from that corner, marked with green.  I will fight 
from this corner, marked with blue.  The battle will begin in ten 
minutes.&#148;

Motoko&#146;s sister began stretching.  This would be a ridiculously easy 
fight.  She glanced over at Shinobu&#146;s corner&#133;

Shinobu wiped a tear from Motoko&#146;s eye.  They kissed tenderly.  It 
wasn&#146;t a particularly long or deep kiss, but it was undoubtedly a kiss 
between two lovers who would die for each other.  The tall samurai 
hadn&#146;t expected to see that.

&#147;May I use your sword?&#148; Shinobu asked her lover.

&#147;Shinobu,&#148; Motoko&#146;s voice shook, &#147;how did it come to this?  I can&#146;t 
tell you how sorry I am.&#148;

&#147;You have no reason to apologize.&#148;

&#147;But you could be hurt!  I&#146;m so scared.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t be scared,&#148; the blue-haired girl said with a small smile.  She 
wiped a tear from her fianc&eacute;e&#146;s eye.  &#147;I promise you that I will be 
all right.&#148;

Motoko drew Shinobu into a kiss, not knowing that her sister was 
watching and starting to wonder if maybe she was wrong and they were 
right.  Motoko handed Shinobu her sword.

&#147;You shouldn&#146;t have to fight her.&#148;

&#147;Sooner or later, we&#146;ve all got to fight.  If you aren&#146;t worth 
fighting for, nothing is.&#148;  Shinobu crouched in her best approximation 
of Motoko&#146;s ready stance.

That&#146;s almost the correct posture, Motoko&#146;s sister thought as she 
looked at Shinobu.  She must watch my sister a lot.  The elder Aoyama 
struck the fight gong.

The duelists started towards each other.  There was no fear in 
Shinobu&#146;s eyes, just a bit of sadness.  Motoko&#146;s sister disarmed 
Shinobu in the first pass, sending the sword flying out of the ring.  
Shinobu ran after it, but her opponent&#146;s long legs outdistanced her 
and she was knocked to the ground.

&#147;Yield.&#148;

&#147;I will not.&#148;

The tall warrior brought her sword&#146;s tip to within a millimeter of 
Shinobu&#146;s throat.  &#147;If I take first blood, I will take it from here.  
Yield!&#148;

There was still no fear in Shinobu&#146;s purple eyes.  &#147;Never.&#148;

The older woman&#146;s vision suddenly blurred with tears.  &#147;Then I yield,&#148; 
she whispered.  She extended her hand and helped the shorter woman up 
from the grass.  &#147;I see that you do love Motoko-fiercely, beyond 
reason.  Therefore, I must apologize to you.  Gomen nasai.&#148;

You are protective of your little sister; I can understand that.  I 
forgive you, Aoyama-san.&#148;

Motoko rushed to Shinobu and delivered an immense hug to the 
blue-haired girl.  &#147;My courageous warrior,&#148; she sighed as a single 
tear ran down her face.

&#147;Yes, you are truly brave,&#148; her sister agreed.  &#147;You would have been 
an invincible samurai if you had been raised as my sister and I were.

&#147;Please, join me for lunch.  We have many things to talk about, I 
think.&#148;

The trio entered the long, plain house together.  Motoko&#146;s sister 
started making the meal and Shinobu insisted on helping.  Once they 
sat down to eat&#133;

&#147;It&#146;s wonderful!&#148; the oldest woman praised Shinobu.  &#147;Did you say you 
were a cook?&#148;

&#147;She is the supervising chef at Kaman&#146;ri Hotel,&#148; Motoko proudly 
stated.

&#147;My goodness, and you&#146;re so young!  So the way to Motoko&#146;s heart is 
through her stomach, ne?&#148;

Both lovers sweatdropped.  &#147;I-I&#146;m not that good,&#148; Shinobu said.  &#147;But 
I&#146;m glad you approve.&#148;

&#147;And that&#146;s not the way to my heart, thank you!&#148; Motoko huffed.  &#147;She 
won me the same way she convinced you: with her courage.&#148;

Shinobu glowed with embarrassed pleasure.  &#147;Now, about Shinmei&#133;&#148;

&#147;Yes,&#148; the sisters said together, looking serious.

&#147;I need your guidance, big sister,&#148; Motoko said.  &#147;The fact is that we 
have no bachelorettes left.  But there must be a way to keep the 
school open.  Isn&#146;t there?&#148;

&#147;I think so,&#148; her sister smiled.  &#147;Do you know what the original 
reason for a single teacher was?  It was because the school&#146;s founders 
believed that a family would require too much time of the mistress or 
master.  That may be true, but&#133;&#148;

&#147;&#133;Please, go on,&#148; Motoko urged.  She and her fianc&eacute;e were hanging on 
every word.

&#147;If the school had two teachers&#133;&#148;

&#147;What a terrific idea!&#148; Shinobu exclaimed.  &#147;If you would teach with 
Toko-chan-&#147;

&#147;Is that allowed?&#148; Motoko asked.

&#147;I don&#146;t know.  I am the older sister, but only the mistress of the 
school can decide that.&#148;

&#147;The concept is sound,&#148; Motoko said.  &#147;We would have to operate as 
equals, or it wouldn&#146;t work.  Would you accept the position?&#148;

The elder Aoyama pursed her lips.  &#147;It would mean quitting my job as a 
librarian-&#147;

&#147;-You&#146;re a librarian?&#148; Shinobu burst out.  She tried and failed to 
suppress her laughter.  Motoko&#146;s sister shot her an icy glare.

&#147;You probably think it&#146;s not suitable for someone like me?  I&#146;m good 
at it, I&#146;ll have you know,&#148; she stated, taking mock-offense.  In spite 
of all her discipline, she smiled and then started laughing with 
Shinobu, and Motoko after a moment.

&#147;As you were saying?&#148; the blue-haired girl chuckled once the laughing 
fit had passed.

&#147;Yes, it would mean quitting my job, getting back in shape, and 
working out a few other pesky details, but I think I could agree to 
teach at the school.  We really ought to share the responsibility, 
actually.&#148;  The woman with the dark brown hair sipped her tea, then 
continued speaking.

&#147;As long as the quality of lessons stays high, I don&#146;t anticipate 
problems for the Shinmei School.  We&#146;ve got a great reputation.

&#147;Now we can stop worrying about that for a bit and press on to the 
next-more enjoyable-topic, which is the marriage.  First, I must claim 
my right, as my sister&#146;s oldest relative, to give her away.  When were 
you planning on having the ceremony?&#148;

&#147;The second or third Friday of April,&#148; Motoko answered.

&#147;That will be so beautiful, in early spring,&#148; the older woman sighed.  
&#147;What kind of service will it be?&#148;

For more than two hours, the women discussed the wedding and 
surrounding events.  All traces of their earlier tension had vanished.

Eventually Motoko had to remind the other two ladies of the time.  The 
fianc&eacute;es got up to leave, and an overpowering curiosity struck the 
older Aoyama.  &#147;Forgive me, Shinobu-san, but I&#146;d like to talk to 
Motoko in private for a short while.&#148;

&#147;Okay.  I&#146;ll be waiting out front, Toko-chan.&#148;

Motoko was suddenly very wary.  Her sister had a strange look on her 
face.  &#147;Nani?&#148; Motoko asked.

&#147;Shinobu is really something.  She&#146;s a wonderful cook, brave, gentle, 
wise, and obviously a knockout.  But&#133;I know you.  You&#146;re a very 
physical person.  So at the risk of rudeness, how is she?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t under-&#147;

Suddenly, Motoko&#146;s eyes widened and her face reddened.

&#147;Blessed kami-sama!  Are you asking what I think you are asking?&#148;

The elder Aoyama secretly enjoyed watching her sister blush.  She 
nodded slowly.  &#147;Of course, you don&#146;t have to tell me.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re right, I don&#146;t!&#148;  Motoko crossed her arms over her chest and 
indignantly flipped her hair over her shoulder.  She carefully watched 
from the corner of her eye.  As her sister started to turn away, 
Motoko rushed forward on silent feet.

&#147;She&#146;s like wildfire,&#148; Motoko whispered into her sister&#146;s ear.  &#147;She 
delivers huge bundles of pleasure, and never just one.  Usually, more 
than three.&#148;  Then it was Motoko&#146;s turn to watch her sister blush.

&#147;Whoa.  That good, is she?&#148; the taller samurai said in a small voice.

&#147;Her tongue is the chariot to paradise.&#148;

&#147;Okay!  I get the picture!&#148;

Motoko noticed that when they met with Shinobu, it wasn&#146;t easy for her 
sister to look Shinobu in the eye.

&#147;What did you tell her?&#148; the shorter woman demanded as she drove 
herself and Motoko back toward Kyoto.

&#147;I told her that, as a lover, you can work miracles.&#148;

&#147;Toko-chan!&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t blame me; she asked.&#148;

&#147;She did?&#148;

&#147;Hai.&#148;

&#147;Well.&#148;  Shinobu thought for a moment.  &#147;I didn&#146;t expect that; but I 
guess it proves that we got her to see us as what we are.&#148;

&#147;True.&#148;

&#147;&#146;Miracles,&#146; you said?  I guess you figured that I&#146;d notice her 
discomfiture and ask about it.  Trying to flatter me, ne?&#148;

&#147;Um&#133;&#148;

Shinobu grinned lasciviously.  &#147;It worked.  I hope you didn&#146;t want any 
sleep tonight.&#148;</pre>
