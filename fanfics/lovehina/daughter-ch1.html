<h1>Daughter of Molmol (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../lovehina/index.html">Love Hina</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sosuume.html">so suu me</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Time: The Mid &#145;80s

Place:  A Land that&#146;s a lot like India but isn&#146;t India 

          Narima watched the toddler, her granddaughter, hard at work 
at her blocks with penetrating interest.  
         Now normally a second daughter would be raised as sort of a 
household pet, rather than someone who would be taken seriously.  Her 
father, a member of the royal family, doted on the child enough, but 
reserved the most time for his son and heir as was common in this part 
of the world.  Oddly, her mother seemed to be more disappointed in her 
third child&#146;s sex and seemed to have less time for her than her father.
	Don&#146;t worry, little child, I will make up for them.
	It was at the little girl&#146;s birth that Narima noticed what stood 
out about this child.  The first was the hair - a straw color in a land 
where nearly everybody had dark hair.  Narima guessed this hair came 
from her own father, a young lieutenant who was one of the last 
colonial administrators sent by Britain.   
	Narima then noticed other things about the child.  For one thing, 
her extreme appetite.  She would eat twice the porridge of the sister 
and brother at that age and ask for more.   She could not be 
constrained from eating bugs - with no ill effect.  And her energy 
level, which would make a chital deer seem slow.  She maybe slept three 
hours in a day, and would be in constant motion the rest.    They would 
have had to hire a second ayah if Narima hadn&#146;t volunteered to help 
oversee the child.
	And smart, too.  Wereas all other child would keep their blocks 
in a random pile, this child would sort them carefully and put together 
symmetrical towers that held together.   Once Narima even saw her 
marking how many she had of each block with marks on a piece of paper 
before beginning to build.  
	Narima looked again at the child and thought of her own father - 
Kaolla Suu&#146;s great-grandfather.   Oh, he had helped her mother out for 
a while, but the payments came less and less and finally stopped.   
After all, he had his Army/foreign service career.  Despite the 
nonsupport, Narima&#146;s mother kept track of his adventures in service of 
the Crown - Korea, Cyprus, Aden, even the Falklands.   	
	Brigadier Chappenwald retired last year, with full honors 
including the rank of Commander in the O.B.E and a barony.   He had no 
knowledge of his great-grandchild here on the floor.   
	If only he could stay around until she makes something of 
herself, Narima thought.  Queen of Bollywood?  No, she could do better 
than that.  University professor at Oxford?   That would have 
possibilities.
	Such great karma it would be if the old man hangs around long 
enough to meet her... 


ABOUT FOURTEEN OR SO YEARS LATER

	&quot;WHERE IS SHE?!  WHERE IS SHE?&quot; Motoko demanded, her skin 
dripping, wrapped in a bathrobe.   
	For the second time this week, Suu had left Tama on her clothing, 
knowing the samurai would go into an embarrassing swoon.  The Tama 
trick never grew old for Suu, no matter how quickly it grew old on 
Motoko.
	Shaking with rage, Motoko took up her kendo stick and stalked her 
target like an tiger.   Suddenly a body with bare, nut-brown legs shot 
down the hall.  Motoko went in furious pursuit.
	But rounding the corner she slammed squarely into Keitaro, who 
was carrying over some window cleaner and rags.   Both fell to the 
floor.  Keitaro picked himself up to see Motoko&#146;s robe open and her 
pubic triangle, dark and lush, exposed to his view.  He was so 
transfixed he failed to see the expression on the tall girl&#146;s face, as 
her rage acquired a fresh - and much less evasive - target.	
	Standing on the balcony, Kaolla Suu munched a roll while watching 
Keitaro soar past her to make a leisurely climb into the sky.   Quite 
impressive to watch, she thought.   
	Then, because she knew Motoko&#146;s wrath was easily dissipated (at 
least toward her), she  hung down and looked into the window.   The 
samurai was making furious circles still, so Suu stayed on the balcony.  
Walking over, she found the tree that ran past her room; and quickly 
shimmied down into the open window.   
	Suu&#146;s room was overrun with plants, including a large tropical 
tree whose branches were wide enough for her to sleep on.   She had 
designed a way for the volcanic heat that warmed the bath to come into 
her room and to heat it to a temperature that both she and the plants 
liked - about 90 degrees.   
         The only spaces without vegetation were her desk, a very large 
one with numerous drawings of planned and built contraptions, plus a 
closet for her carefully preserved traditional costumes.   A picture of 
her stepbrother,  Ranba Ruu, one of her sister, plus a collective one 
of the gang here at Hina House. A bureau, and a washstand.
	Little known to the rest of the group was another secret passage, 
this one to her workshop on the bottom floor.  As others rarely went 
there, she could often surprise people with the devices that came out, 
such as Mecha-Tama in its various editions.
	Enjoying her aloneness for once, she poured herself a green tea.  
Removing her skimpy uniform- shirt, skirt and panties, she didn&#146;t wear 
a bra - she activated the Sun Magnifier that could put a spot of 
sunlight directly on her sleeping perch in the tree.  Suu climbed up 
and let the sun play on her bare backside.  The other, lighter skinned 
residents may not notice her tan, but she took pride in it.   
	Normally she would be drawing plans for a new radio controlled 
device, but not this time.   She was more thinking about what was going 
on with her body.   According to old lore, her people individually 
decided the exact time to turn from child to adult.   Suu&#146;s response 
was, for now, &quot;I want to be a child a little longer.&quot;  But once every 
three months, during the red moon, the adult Suu would emerge.  She 
could deal with that - in fact she looked forward to wearing the skimpy 
top and full skirt and anklet.  
	But something strange had been happening these past year.  The 
adult Suu would emerge without warning, without a red moon.   At first 
it was a freak occurrence.   She&#146;d wake up in the middle of the night 
taller, with swelled breasts, a fuller voice.  She ignored it the first 
time it happened.  But then, it happened once a month.   And last 
month, it happened twice.   It was like &quot;Jekyll and Hyde&quot; late in the 
book, when Jekyll would involuntarily morph into Hyde without warning.
	I&#146;ve been waiting too long.  They never told me this, but it 
makes sense - if you delay too long, nature will make the move for you.
	And then there was the strange occurrence after the bath the 
other week.   She must have been admiring the others too much.  When 
she went to towel herself off, she felt a violent shiver, beginning 
between her legs and spreading all over.  It was so strong she fell to 
the floor.   She pulled herself up shaking.  Everything seemed to have 
a pleasant glow.  She felt fantastic.   She had &quot;gotten off&quot; before - 
very often in fact - but nothing like this.  Shinobu came in, and Suu 
was tempted to kiss her for no reason.
	She didn&#146;t know what it was, but she definitely wanted it to 
happen again.	
	She heard a knock and the door and the door open slightly.  &quot;Suu?  
Are you in there?&quot;
	It was Kitsune.  &quot;Come on in,&quot; Suu replied.
	Kitsune looked up in her usual amused fashion.  &quot;Ya know, kid, 
you shouldn&#146;t play with Motoko-chan that way.  Some day she&#146;s gonna be 
too quick for you, and Keitaro-sempai won&#146;t happen around to take the 
heat off.  That stick of hers would hurt.
	&quot;You been feeling okay, Suu?  Been acting strange of late.&quot;
	Suu wanted to talk to her, so she asked Kitsune to close the 
door.  Then she talked down from her branch.   &quot;I&#146;m sorry I keep 
playing so many pranks on Toko-san.  I don&#146;t know why I do it.&quot;
	Kitsune  climbed up into the branch herself; and took in the 
sight of her friend&#146;s small nude body.   She used to shrug off the 
friendship between Suu and Motoko, but she now felt a twinge of envy.   
Damn, the girl may still act ten years old, but her body&#146;s clearly 
getting far ahead of her...For the first time, Kit noticed a dark 
thatch between Suu&#146;s legs, and a broadening of the hips.   Wonder what 
that skin would taste like...Kitsune was beginning an affair with 
someone off campus.  Didn&#146;t need this distraction.  But she wanted to 
keep looking.
	&quot;You still sleep with &#145;Toko-chan, don&#146;t you?&quot;
	&quot;Yes, I do, about twice a week.  She&#146;s my toshokan.  Elsewise I 
sleep up there.&quot;
	Kitsume was conflicted between playing her original role as 
counselor and her desire to make a pass at the little figure before 
her.   She had been intimate in one degree or another with all the 
other residents.  She didn&#146;t know why she hadn&#146;t made more of a try 
with this one.
	&quot;Do you kiss her?&quot;  she said, sitting herself down next to Suu.
	&quot;Of course.  Every night before we turn out the light.   
Sometimes in the morning, but I&#146;m usually up before her.&quot;   
	&quot;Do you ever - uhm, open your mouth?&quot;   
	Suu responded with a giggle.  &quot;No.   I&#146;m not sure she&#146;d like 
that.&quot;
	&quot;Do you touch her?  I mean, on her boobs, or her cunny?&quot;
	&quot;No,&quot; laughed Suu.   &quot;Cunny?  Is that something to eat?  Does it 
taste good?&quot;
	&quot;Your cunt, silly.  And yes, you can eat them.  They taste very 
good.&quot;
	&quot;We don&#146;t do anything like that.&quot;  But the way Suu said it, 
Kitsume knew she had an opening.
	&quot;Of course she&#146;d like that,&quot; Kitsume said, her familiar deviltry 
reasserting itself.   &quot;She&#146;s probably thinks you&#146;re too small to really 
appreciate it.   You know, Suu, if *you&#146;ve* thought about touching her, 
certainly she&#146;s thought about the same.  She wants you to show some 
initiative.  Right now she&#146;s pissed at you, but here&#146;s a chance to make 
it up, and let momentum carry you.
	&quot;Do you know how to kiss open-mouthed?&quot;
	Suu shook her head.  The idea had seemed vaguely repellent, much 
as she heard it discussed.
	&quot;Would you like me to teach you?&quot;
	&quot;Sure!&quot; Suu replied with enthusiasm.
	Kitsume&#146;s heart was beating faster. &quot;You start like this.&quot;  She 
leaned in, and used her lips to caress Suu&#146;s.  At first, she kept her 
tongue well in her mouth.   She guided Suu&#146;s lips to do the same.    
She smelt her breath; it smelled like bananas (it always did this time 
of day).   Soon enough, Kitsume felt the first probing touch of the 
smaller girl&#146;s tongue.  She caressed it with her lips and then probed 
her own tongue forward.  When Suu squeezed it gently between her lips 
she knew the girl was hers.   Being the oldest and most practiced among 
the students at Hinata House she had great confidence in her powers of 
seduction.
	She felt Suu lean against her.  If only I hadn&#146;t put on these 
slacks.   I&#146;d really like something to get going, but you can&#146;t remove 
slacks without calling attention to your intentions.  
	When  Suu leaned against her, she took it as her cue.  She took 
small brown hand and placed it against her shirt.   Suu&#146;s hand caressed 
her, but Kitsume noticed she did not try to open the buttons.   
           &quot;you like that, Suu?&quot; Katsuma whispered.   She felt a nod in 
response, as Suu&#146;s mouth learned the intricacies of the French kiss.   
I&#146;ve got her now, Kat-chan thought triumphally.   She surreptitiously 
worked several buttons free on her shirt and felt Suu&#146;s hand take the 
hint and slip inside.  I&#146;ve got the best tits in Haruna House, she 
thought, not even Naru has knockers like these.   I think I caught Suu 
staring at them once...		But Suu didn&#146;t make a dive for her 
bra clasp like Kat hoped she would.   Instead she seemed transfixed and 
delighted by the sensation of Kat&#146;s lips and mouth on her own.   The 
sensation between Kat&#146;s legs was making her uncomfortable, telling her 
it was time to move on.  Well, I&#146;ll just have to show her, Kit thought.      
	She disengaged her mouth, and began to kiss Suu&#146;s neck.  Suu 
started purring like a stroked kitten.   Before too long Kit&#146;s lips 
came to the small rise that constituted Suu&#146;s breasts.    She circled 
it with kisses and licks.   Only then did she take Suu&#146;s nipple into 
her mouth.  Suu ached her back and sucked in an ecstatic breath, a 
smile very exceptional even on a face that displayed many smiles.    
Kit then did it to the other nipple, and noticed that Suu&#146;s pelvis was 
girating with readiness and the air was full of her scent, which Kat 
thought smelled like curry.  
	Kit slipped her hand down to touch her small dark hairs, then 
made circular motions around Suu&#146;s entrance.  Suu&#146;s tongue took on a 
new urgency in Kit&#146;s mouth.   But disturbed at the younger girl&#146;s 
seeming caution, Kat guided Suu&#146;s sweet hand to her crotch.    Suu 
caressed it quickly, but clumsily.   In the meantime, Kit&#146;s fingers 
managed to undo the snap and tried to free her hips of the tight 
fitting slacks.   
	Well, I don&#146;t know what to do to make this girl want to service 
me....Maybe she doesn&#146;t know what it feels like.   Reversing Suu, 
laying her down on the bough, Kat maneuvered her mouth to Suu&#146;s cunny, 
and started probing with her tongue.   Suu seemed to know exactly what 
to expect.    She sighed, sighed again, then began crying out, 
jabbering relentlessly in her own language (the only time anyone had 
heard her speak it) then unmistakably in Japanese, quick, quick, I want 
I want come I want come now  aggghhh!   Agggghhhh, AAAGGGGHH!   she 
intoned with the unmistakable tone of release.  Then there was a great 
sucking in of breath as the little brown girl orgasmed, shaking again 
and again. Keeping one hand on her boob, Kitsume could swear she 
managed to add a bra cup size in just ten minutes.   
	Now it&#146;s my turn.
	But sudden physical maturity could not bring on an equivalent 
increase in emotional solicitude.  With Suu&#146;s orgasm achieved, Kit was 
cast off like an unwanted jelly sandwich. &quot;That was great!&quot; the little 
brown girl exclaimed.  &quot;I must try it with Toko-san!&quot; she added eagerly 
as she leapt off the branch.   Having been disengaged so suddenly, 
Kitsume lost her balance.
	Without Suu even noticing it, Kitsume fell from the branch onto 
the soft earth below, with her slacks halfway off.  Before Kit even 
picked herself up, Suu had replaced her skimpy outfit and was running 
out the door.   To finish Kit&#146;s mortification, Keitaro happened to be 
walking past, and saw her odd position and dishabille.  Kit didn&#146;t know 
he was too upset about the humiliation that Suu had caused *him* to 
notice her predicament.         
	Well, I know I can get what I want from *him,* Kitsume thought.  
And then I can ditch him just like I&#146;ve just been ditched.
	But let me get off the floor first...</pre>
