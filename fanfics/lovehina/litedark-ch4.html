<h1>Angel Light, Angel Dark (part 4 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../lovehina/index.html">Love Hina</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kanako.html">Kanako Urashima</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../lovehina/litedark-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>In the middle of the night, Kanako stared up at the ceiling of the 
Maehara household, as if fascinated by the minute cracks on the tiles. 
She had been like that for a few hours now, wondering about what 
Shinobu had meant with those words she spoke before. She recalled 
them, &#145;and right now, you have&#133;me&#146; were Shinobu&#146;s exact words. She 
strained to find the meaning of those words, struggled to find a 
reason why anyone would be so nice to her, why anyone would ever offer 
her a shoulder to cry on. Shinobu was more than a friend now, she was 
someone that would understand how it was to be so alone, so isolated, 
so sad. It made her forget about the guilt, the overwhelming fear that 
Shinobu, Miho and Shinji would one day find out what really happened 
to Shinji&#146;s father. Suddenly, she felt Shinobu roll in her sleep and 
her gentle hand landed across Kanako&#146;s body. It made Kanako blush for 
a moment but she calmed down quickly.

&#147;Shinobu-chan&#133;&#148; Kanako muttered to herself. &#147;Why?&#148;

It was incomprehensible for her, for anyone to show even the slightest 
concern for her. So many years have passed; all of them were spent on 
the brink of darkness, exiled in the grim shadows of loneliness. 
Solitude was her mantra, isolation her philosophy, her rifle her best 
and only friend. Now, as she looked at Shinobu sleeping beside her, 
her hands running through those beautiful blue strands, she wondered 
if she was still the girl that Shinobu befriended. The past seven 
years had been the darkest in her whole life, now, within less than a 
day, there was light in her life once again and that light came in the 
form of a friend like Shinobu. She sighed and as she opened her eyes 
again, Shinobu&#146;s face was merely an inch away from hers, so close that 
Kanako could feel Shinobu&#146;s breathing. It made her tense, excited to a 
degree, but ultimately, it made her feel calm. Unconsciously, she 
began to lean forward, her eyes staring at that angelic face. She 
stopped herself though before her face touched Shinobu&#146;s, it was too 
much.

&#147;Why are you doing this, Shinobu-chan?&#148;

Shinobu seemed to stir a little as Kanako finished, almost as if she 
had heard Kanako speak. In a second though, that fear cleared as 
Shinobu turned away. Kanako let out a sigh of relief as she thought 
she realty needed to get some sleep and closed her eyes. Kanako turned 
her body to the side, facing away from Shinobu. What she didn&#146;t 
realize was that Shinobu wasn&#146;t asleep, not completely anyway. She was 
awake and aware enough to know what Kanako was saying and out of a 
small open slit in her beautiful ice blue eyes, she saw Kanako&#146;s 
expression as she said those words. That expression didn&#146;t strike her 
as the face of someone who was wondering about something but rather, 
it reminded her of someone who was trying to tell someone else 
something important. What it could be was something beyond Shinobu&#146;s 
comprehension, since most things about Kanako are beyond Shinobu&#146;s 
comprehension.

&#147;It&#146;s because I care, Kanako-san, because I care.&#148;

Morning came a little too soon for Kanako, it was not exactly her 
favorite time of day. Mornings, with the sun rising to light up the 
world, made her want to recede into the shadows or into the 
underground. She immediately turned away from the window, which 
Shinobu had opened. The young, angelic girl should have known better 
than to do that. With a slight, snake-like hiss, Kanako moved out of 
the room and into the hallway. There, she bumped into the energetic 
young Maehara Shinji, who smiled at her and proceeded to rush down. 
Those eyes reminded her of the guilt she felt over killing his father, 
a sensation that had never haunted her so before. Somehow, being so 
close to those left behind by one of her victims served to be her own 
personal Hell. Part of her longed, almost needed, to tell Shinobu, 
Shinji and Miho about what she had done but that exact same part of 
her feared how they would react. She might well never see Shinobu 
again. She didn&#146;t want that, she didn&#146;t want to lose what little 
enjoyment she had in life.

&#147;I&#146;ll go mad if I see that boy again&#133;&#148; she muttered to herself.

&#147;Sometimes, he drives me mad too.&#148;

&#147;Miho-san&#133;&#148;

Maehara Miho, the purple haired older sister of the angel in the other 
room. She still had her over-sized t-shirt on her, one that was plain 
red, with a small blue orb that had white, super deformed angel wings 
on it. It was a childish design, in as much as anything can be 
considered childish in the right situation, but Miho didn&#146;t seem to 
know, or care. Miho&#146;s smile was fundamentally different from that of 
Shinobu&#146;s, or anyone else that Kanako knew, even her own. Her smile 
had the sincerity inherent in a true smile but something about the way 
the lips curved, the way that small dimple on her cheek seemed to pop 
out of nowhere the very instant she would start to smile and vanish 
once the smile was in place. There was a single-minded tenacity, an 
unyielding persistence that was well hidden behind those well meaning, 
kind and almost unbearably innocent eyes of hers. This girl, by 
Kanako&#146;s assessment, is essentially different from Shinobu.

&#147;That boy is so energetic, it&#146;s scary.&#148; Miho sighed, keeping that 
smile.

&#147;I remember Su-chan from Hinata Sou.&#148; Kanako answered. &#147;Now that girl 
was energetic.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re not telling her something, are you?&#148; Miho suddenly asked out 
of the blue, raising an eyebrow at her. &#147;Are you?&#148;

Kanako suddenly felt her heart race and she was taken aback by the 
blatantly direct question. She could not have been that obvious that 
she was hiding something from them. It was too soon for her to tell 
anyone of what she had done all those years ago; she wasn&#146;t ready to 
face them. Truth be told, she didn&#146;t think she could ever be ready to 
face them. If she was ever going to let them know, it certainly would 
not be done face to face. She had never been so nervous when faced 
with such a direct assault, it startled her. She had never felt so 
nervous and unprepared before, as she looked at Miho&#146;s frightening 
purple eyes. There was a void in them that threatened to simply allow 
her to fall into them and let her remain lost in those purple spiral 
traps. The way she looked made Kanako&#146;s palms sweat a little, 
reminding her of her nervousness when she made her first few kills. 
Then, Miho smiled again, as if to break off the attack.

&#147;Well, there must be a reason for you to keep a secret from us. I 
understand.&#148; Miho said as she walked down the stairs, following after 
Shinji. &#147;If you ever feel like telling us, we&#146;ll be ready to listen.&#148;

&#147;What was that about?&#148; Shinobu asked all of a sudden, startling 
Kanako.

&#147;Don&#146;t sneak up on me like that!&#148; Kanako cried out. Miho&#146;s direct 
question and the fact that it seemed to hit right on its target, 
whether intended or not, was making her more than a touch jumpy. 
&#147;Sorry. I really should cut down on the caffeine.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s alright.&#148;

Both of them laughed out a little, a comfortable, friendly laugh. The 
two of them walked down without even so much as a look at each one 
that the other didn&#146;t notice. Whether or not the events of last night 
had any deeper, emotional meaning or any meaning at all, it didn&#146;t 
matter for the time being. I was a fleeting moment after all, a moment 
that may or may not occur again. Kanako didn&#146;t like living by chance, 
it made her feel like she had no control but the chance that a moment 
like that may come again was something she accepted. Beautiful 
creature, those words were what Kanako thought would best describe 
Shinobu to her eyes. It made her feel both jealous of the unbelievably 
lovely and elegant girl beside her in those steps but it also made her 
feel warm and no longer alone in this cruel world. Shinobu showed that 
she cared for the girl, that Kanako was important to someone other 
than herself. Kanako would not trade that for anything.

&#147;You don&#146;t mind if we just have some sashimi and rice for breakfast, 
do you?&#148; Shinobu asked. &#147;I woke up late this morning and I didn&#146;t have 
enough time to cook a proper meal.&#148;

&#147;Anything will do, Shinobu-chan. I really have no right to impose, 
after all.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s good to hear.&#148; Shinobu smiled. It was a bright smile that hid 
nothing and laid all of Shinobu&#146;s proverbial cards on the table. A 
smile that was fundamentally different from Miho&#146;s. &#147;So, what do you 
plan on doing today?&#148;

&#147;Well, I obviously have to pick up my things at Hinata Sou.&#148; Kanako 
answered. It seemed arrogant, maybe even condescending but it had none 
of those qualities. It was like any other statement, like Shinobu&#146;s 
smile, it hid nothing.

&#147;That&#146;s in the afternoon right, what do you plan to do until then?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll have to settle the arrangements I made with the construction 
company regarding the renovation.&#148; Kanako said with her finger at her 
chin. &#147;Maybe try to re-establish contact with the others, even if they 
would prefer to never hear from me again.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s not true! Urashima-senpai would love to hear from you!&#148;

&#147;Onii-san&#133;&#148;

As Kanako sat down on the table, breaking the chopsticks and eyeing 
the fresh slices of seafood as well as a few prawns on the center of 
the table, she thought of those days in Hinata Sou. The sincere smile 
that showed the heart of gold that beat inside Shinobu as she served 
them their meals in Hinata Sou. Even then, Kanako longed to have a 
smile like that. To have a smile that showed that you can still be 
happy even after seeing so much suffering, living through so much 
agony. She never thought that Shinobu would even consider talking to 
her, knowing just how different the two are. As Kanako watched Shinji 
greedily stuffed, for lack of an appropriate term, down his throat. 
Slowly, Kanako ate her breakfast, her body itching to get back in her 
own clothes again. Her almost completely black attire was the most 
comfortable thing she could imagine herself wearing right now; it had 
been her trademark style for most of her life, after all.

&#147;Where do I put the dishes?&#148; Kanako asked, holding a few bowls in her 
hands as she stood up.

&#147;Let me take those. You had better make those calls you said you had 
to make.&#148;

&#147;Okay. Thanks.&#148;

Kanako quickly made her way to the phone and dialed in the 
construction company&#146;s number. The same way it had been earlier, when 
she first learned she had killed Shinji&#146;s father, the fear of being 
there, the dreadful feeling of being around those that one of her 
victims left behind was starting to settle in. Finalizing the 
arrangements and confirming certain things merely served to distract 
her from that fear, the looming possibility of losing her sanity. She 
had to leave that place as soon as she could, with her mind and body 
intact. Kanako made reservations in a small hotel, near enough the 
Maehara caf&eacute; and household so that she could at least watch Shinobu 
but far enough, she felt, to avoid the sense of dread that would come 
to her now and then when she was around them. It really wasn&#146;t that 
she feared physical harm from Shinobu, though she would not put it 
past Miho, but she feared the reaction that she would get. The 
rejection, the anger, they may not forgive her. She didn&#146;t want to 
lose Shinobu&#146;s presence in her life; she didn&#146;t want to lose the bond 
that had only begun to take root.

&#147;Yeah, Shirai and I will be there. We&#146;ll get to work at around late 
afternoon today.&#148; Haitani confirmed over the phone.

&#147;Good.&#148; Kanako said before hanging up the phone and turning to 
Shinobu. &#147;Shinobu-chan, is my suit dry?&#148;

&#147;Hai, it is. Why do you ask?&#148;

&#147;I think I&#146;ll go out for a while.&#148; Kanako said, showing a perfectly 
faked smile. Perhaps it was faked so perfectly because she didn&#146;t mean 
it to be fake. Shinobu brought out the human being in Kanako, the 
kind; loving and gentle person that Keitaro always knew was there. How 
Kanako wanted to be honest with Shinobu, one of the few people that 
she considered deserved her honesty. &#147;I think I&#146;ll go out for a 
while.&#148;</pre>
