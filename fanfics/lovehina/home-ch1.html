<h2>a <a href="../lovehina/index.html">Love Hina</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rann.html">Rann Aridorn</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	&quot;Naaaruuuuuuuuuu!&quot;
	Naru pouted a bit at hearing her name called. Since she
didn&#39;t want to leave yet, she pretended not to hear and instead
turned her head back to the building looming in front of her. It
looked like no one had lived there in a long time.. it had a
dark, abandoned look, really, but somehow it was still...
inviting. As if it were haunted, but by kind ghosts that wished
to tell her their stories.
	&quot;Naru! There you are!&quot;
	She jumped a bit, short blue hair swishing around her
face as she whirled around guiltily. Her mother walked over,
setting her hands on her hips and looking down at Naru with an
expression that attempted to be stern and didn&#39;t quite make it.
	&quot;Naru, you heard me calling you,&quot; Shinobu Maehara
scolded, shaking her head slightly. Still petite and small as she
had always been, Shinobu had still obviously grown up, holding
herself with a confidence and an unshakable air of &quot;I&#39;m
somebody&#39;s mother&quot; that lent some weight to her unending
cuteness.
	&quot;Sorry, momma,&quot; little Naru Maehara pouted. She&#39;d
inherited much of that same cuteness, but also some awareness of
it, and thus knew what she was doing when she turned wide,
pitiful-looking eyes on her mother.
	Sighing, Shinobu wilted under her daughter&#39;s assault of
kawaii and bent down, gathering the five-year-old up in her arms
and hefting her with a small *whuff*. &quot;You&#39;re getting big,
Naru-chan.&quot;
	Giggling softly at the perceived compliment, Naru put her
arms around her mother&#39;s neck, snuggling in. After a moment,
though, she leaned back and pointed towards the building. &quot;Momma,
is that it?!&quot;
	&quot;Hm? Oh, yes, dear.&quot; Shinobu hefted her daughter up a bit
to get a more secure hold, letting Naru sit on one forearm.
&quot;That&#39;s Hinata Inn.&quot;
	&quot;Same one you always tell stories &#39;bout?&quot; Naru continued,
staring at the old hotel as if entranced.
	&quot;The same one, hai.&quot;
	&quot;How come no one lives there now?&quot;
	&quot;They all grew up and went away, Naru-chan. It&#39;s sad,
sometimes, but it&#39;s the way of things.&quot; Shinobu turned her own
head to look at the inn, where she&#39;d spent some of the happiest,
if strangest, years of her childhood. &quot;But I think everyone who
lived there had their lives changed, and for the better, too.&quot;
	&quot;Momma, how come you left? When was the last time you saw
everyone you tell stories about?&quot;
	&quot;Saw them all in one place?&quot; Shinobu smiled. &quot;Well,
there&#39;s a story that answers both of those questions.&quot;
	&quot;Oooo! Story!&quot; Naru&#39;s eyes lit up in delight, before she
remembered to turn on a plaintive look. &quot;Tell me the story,
mama?&quot;
	Shinobu giggled, bouncing her daughter a bit in her arms.
&quot;Alright... I&#39;ll tell you the story. It was almost fifteen years
ago, and everyone was getting ready for a big ceremony...&quot;

	Naru Narusegawa stared at herself in the mirror, her eyes
alight, her stomach turning flipflops (though that might have
been something else). She turned from side to side slightly,
watching the way the long white dress moved around her legs, then
ran her hands along the white satin hugging her stomach and
sides.
	&quot;Would you hold still?&quot; Mitsune Konno grumbled around a
mouthful of pins, struggling to make last-minute adjustments to
her best friend&#39;s wedding dress.
	&quot;You strain even my skill and aim,&quot; Motoko Aoyama added
with a similar speech impediment, working around the back of
Naru&#39;s dress. &quot;Please contain your excitement,
Narusegawa-senpai.&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s just...&quot; Naru tilted her head up, her
smile practically setting the room alight. &quot;It&#39;s just that this
is the most special day of my life!&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s a good thing you picked now for the most special
day of your life,&quot; Kitsune murmured from where she worked at the
waistline of Naru&#39;s dress. &quot;If you&#39;d waited until next month,
they&#39;d&#39;ve had to let out the stomach on the dress. Again.&quot;
	&quot;S-shut up!&quot; Naru yelped, her cheeks and the bridge of
her nose coloring.
	Motoko merely sighed. She&#39;d promised she wouldn&#39;t say
anything. She&#39;d PROMISED...
	Kitsune stood and shook her head, putting two fingers on
either side of the needles poking out between her lips before
releasing them. She smiled that enigmatic smile that made
everyone think she was constantly up to something. &quot;How&#39;s
everything fit now?&quot;
	&quot;Just great!&quot; Naru&#39;s embarrassment and anger fled as fast
as it had never been, and her sunny smile returned.
	&quot;You look radiant, Narusegawa-senpai,&quot; Motoko sighed, the
normally cool kendoist allowing herself a small smile.
	&quot;Yeah... totally beautiful,&quot; Kitsune added, smile turning
almost... longing. After a moment, she glanced at Motoko. &quot;Could
you give us a few minutes alone, please?&quot;
	&quot;Of course. I have to go get ready myself.&quot; Motoko smiled
once more at Naru, then turned and left the room, sliding the
door closed behind her.
	&quot;You really do look great,&quot; Mitsune whispered as Naru
stepped off the small stand she&#39;d been up on to make it easier to
do the alterations. &quot;I never really expected this day to come,
y&#39;know.&quot;
	&quot;That&#39;s so rude!&quot; Naru replied good-naturedly, sticking
her tongue out. That set both of them to laughing, and the slight
melancholy that had building was razed away like water droplets
on grass kissed by the sun. 
	&quot;I&#39;m jealous,&quot; Kitsune confided when the laughing had
trailed off. She didn&#39;t clarify exactly what she was jealous
of... there were a lot of options.
	&quot;Kitsune,&quot; Naru whispered, smiling at her friend,
stepping forward to hug her tightly.
	Mitsune couldn&#39;t help but be overly careful in hugging
Naru back, despite not wanting to be so silly. &quot;Naru-chan... one
last kiss?&quot;
	&quot;... Of course,&quot; Naru answered quietly, blushing softly
again, tilting her head up a bit.
	Slowly, wanting to let this kiss imprint itself in her
memory, Kitsune leaned her head in, pressing her lips gently to
Naru&#39;s. For just the length of the kiss, she let herself dwell on
what she was losing, and had lost ever since Keitaro Urushima had
come into their lives: Naru&#39;s constant companionship, Naru&#39;s
confiding in her every little problem and fear, Naru&#39;s passionate
embrace and sensual touch. These things she would never have
again... but always, always, the memory of them, and of this
kiss, a kiss from Naru on her wedding day, in her wedding
dress... a kiss just for her.
	&quot;Careful there, Kitsune,&quot; came a low, almost drab voice
from the doorway. &quot;You&#39;ll make us jealous.&quot;
	Naru and Mitsune drew apart, both blushing as they turned
to look at the speaker. Haruka Urashima was standing in the
doorway, the attractive picture created by her elegant green
dress and faint hint of makeup somewhat sullied by the cigarette
hanging from her mouth. At her side was her fiance, Seta
Noriyasu, looking rather dapper in his tuxedo, hands in his
jacket pockets.
	&quot;Or perhaps you&#39;ll make Urushima-san jealous,&quot; Seta
added, grinning and adjusting his glasses.
	&quot;I can kiss the bride if I want,&quot; Kitsune contended with
a grin of her own, walking over to stand between her lovers and
folding her arms over her chest.
	&quot;Seta-san... Haruka-san,&quot; Naru greeted, smiling. &quot;Thank
you for coming.&quot;
	&quot;You look beautiful, Narusegawa-san,&quot; Seta replied. &quot;A
Western ceremony?&quot;
	&quot;Keitaro&#39;s parents are paying, and they didn&#39;t have
enough money for a big Japanese ceremony,&quot; Naru said with just
the tiniest hint of annoyance. Then she smiled again, shrugging
it off. &quot;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m happy having it here, at the Hinata Inn
with all my friends.&quot;
	&quot;As it should be,&quot; Haruka drawled, blowing her cigarette
smoke in a completely different direction than Naru.
	&quot;I better go get dressed too,&quot; Kitsune said after Seta
had taken his own turn at kissing the bride, though it was just a
peck on the cheek. Then, in an overly-innocent tone, added,
&quot;Haruka, Noriyasu, would you like to help me?&quot;
	&quot;I think we could manage that,&quot; Seta said in a cheerful
tone.
	Naru giggled a bit as the trio departed, then turned back
to her mirror, swishing her dress about. &quot;o/` Naru Urushimaaaa,
student marriage, succeeding at Tokyo U... o/`&quot;

	Shinobu rushed back and forth in the kitchen, rapidly
moving from her almost constant state of near-panic into
full-blown, hyperventilating, screaming and tearing her hair out,
actual REAL panic. The reception was in a matter of hours, and
things weren&#39;t working out right at all. The food orders had been
delivered improperly, and she had fifty portions of beef and
nineteen of chicken when people wanted nineteen portions of beef
and fifty portions of chicken, she&#39;d just been informed that
twelve of the guests had allergies to key ingredients in the
glaze she had already used on all the portions, and Kaolla was
still insisting that they could make enough turtle soup out of
Tamago to feed everyone if they used enough spice.
	&#39;I will not panic, I will not panic!&#39; she chanted
mentally, despite the fact that her fingers were buried in her
hair and her eyes showed white all the way around. She couldn&#39;t
let her friends down, not today, no matter how much she wanted to
curl up in a tiny little ball and whimper until it all went away.
	Kaolla was watching Shinobu with great interest, the
dark-skinned girl standing on one bare foot, the other raised up
and held at waist height for no apparent reason. &quot;Shinobuuu... is
your head going to pop?&quot;
	&#39;Maybe,&#39; Shinobu thought, and fought the urge to break
out in hysterical laughter and faint. Her gaze came to rest on
Tamago where the turtle sat on the counter, black beady eyes
fixed on her. &#39;You know, maybe Kaolla&#39;s right, maybe with enough
seasoning and vegetables... ack, no!&#39;
	Quickly, she did some of the breathing exercises that
Motoko had taught her, and felt herself calm a little. Okay, that
was better. She took one last long, deep breath, then let it out
in a rush.
	Then she zipped over and grabbed Kaolla by the front of
her school uniform blouse. &quot;Kaolla-san, you have to help me! You
have to make some sort of machine that will take the glaze off
the food or turn beef into chicken and NOT BLOW UP!&quot;
	Kaolla sweatdropped, used to Shinobu spazzing out, but
not quite this way, and not quite this badly. &quot;O-okay, Shinobu,
Kaolla will do her best best...&quot;
	The indigo-haired girl gave her friend a shaky smile.
&quot;Thank you... thank you, Kaolla-san. Now... I think I&#39;m just
going to take a little nap.&quot; And with that, she slumped to the
floor in a faint, eyes swirling.

	&quot;I tell ya, Urushima, you&#39;re one lucky bastard,&quot; Haitani
crowed, slapping Keitaro&#39;s shoulder. &quot;You&#39;ll have that hotty Naru
in bed every night for the rest of your life!&quot;
	&quot;Eh-heh-heh... yeah,&quot; Keitaro agreed sheepishly, rubbing
the back of his head.
	&quot;Of course... you&#39;ll ONLY have that hotty Naru in bed for
the rest of your life,&quot; Shirai amended as he straightened his
friend&#39;s bowtie.
	&quot;... What do you mean?&quot; Keitaro asked, clueless as
always.
	&quot;Well, geez, just think, man! You had that hotty Mutsumi
after ya too... and if you&#39;d worked at it, I bet Motoko woulda
gone for ya... that cute Shinobu had the hots for you, if ya
waited a few years... and then there&#39;s that sex-goddess
Mitsune...&quot;
	&quot;Oh yeaaaah, Mitsune!&quot; Haitani&#39;s eyes glazed over
momentarily at the thought of the sandy blonde. &quot;Keitaro, you&#39;re
giving a chance at all those girls up to settle down to married
life! That takes guts, man! I wouldn&#39;t be able to stand it!&quot;
	&quot;Keitaro&#39;s a stand-up guy, that&#39;s for sure, not giving in
to all that temptation!&quot;
	Keitaro stared straight ahead, and fought the desire to
whimper.

	Shinobu winced as she came to, sitting up and putting a
hand to her head. She blinked as she looked down and saw that she
was laying on her futon. &#39;ACK! I can&#39;t be in here!&#39; Throwing the
blanket aside, she raced out of the room and down into the
kitchen... and stared.
	Nineteen perfectly-prepared portions of beef. Fifty
perfectly-prepared portions of chicken. A slightly different hue
showing that a different glaze had been used. And Tamago was
resting comfortably atop Kaolla&#39;s head, the dark-skinned girl
covered head to toe in splatters of food, a bright smile alight
on her face.
	&quot;I got it done!&quot;
	&quot;Kaolla-san...&quot; Shinobu stared, looking around at
everything, at the giant wedding cake that remained perfect and
unscathed, staring at the plates of food, and at Kaolla. &quot;H-how?&quot;
	&quot;Wasn&#39;t easy,&quot; Kaolla admitted sheepishly, rubbing the
back of her head.
	&quot;Oh... oh Kaolla-san! Kaolla-san, thank you!&quot; Shinobu
threw herself forward and wrapped her arms around the other
girl&#39;s neck and hugging her.
	She felt those skinny, strong arms go around her to
return the hug, then went stiff as she felt Kaolla pull back
enough to... kiss her. Shinobu&#39;s face immediately turned tomato
red, and she felt like her knees would collapse under her. But
Kaolla&#39;s hold on her was firm and unyielding, and Shinobu was
finding it extremely pleasant not only to be kissed, but to kiss
back as well.
	After what could have been an hour, Kaolla leaned back,
grinning like always, though there was a glint in her eyes.
Shinobu was still blushing, but found herself automatically
returning the smile.
	&quot;Good as the last time Kaolla kissed you?&quot; Kaolla
chirped, winking.
	&quot;... My first kiss,&quot; Shinobu whispered, looking down a
bit. &quot;I... I think this one was better, Kaolla-san...&quot;
	&quot;Oh, good!&quot; came the bright answer. &quot;Because we&#39;re not
just little girls anymore... not like we were back then. And I
think we should do a lot of things we didn&#39;t, then.&quot;
	&quot;W-what?&quot;
	&quot;C&#39;mon, Shinobuuuuu... help Kaolla get out of these
clothes and get cleaned up!&quot;
	&quot;W-WHAT?! ... Okay.&quot;

	Three hours later, Shinobu was sitting at the reception,
hands resting lightly in her lap, and STILL blushing. She was
starting to think it was permanent. Every time it even began to
go away, she&#39;d look over at Kaolla, and the other girl would give
her a grin and a wink that would start it up at full heat all
over again... as well as other things. Then, abruptly, the blush
faded, as she realized that it could only make what she had to
say even harder.
	&#39;I can&#39;t... I just can&#39;t,&#39; she thought, hopelessly, the
planned toasts passing her by. Every bit of her happiness was now
converted to melancholy at what lay ahead in the few days to
come. With an effort, she firmed up her resolve and listened in.
She wouldn&#39;t let the happiest day of two of her best friends&#39;
lives be a sad one in her memory.
	&quot;-and, well, what can I say? I suppose he&#39;s glad that he
didn&#39;t let a video game determine who he&#39;d date!&quot; Everyone
laughed lightly at the conclusion of Kentaro&#39;s story, then
snickered when he added, &quot;I can&#39;t help but wish he&#39;d listened
when it said &#39;game over&#39;, or this might be my wedding.&quot; Naru
rolled her eyes good-naturedly, and Keitaro smiled a little
shakily. &quot;Honestly, though... Naru, Keitaro... I wish you every
last happiness in the world.&quot; He raised his glass, letting the
toast be acknowledged, then looked around. &quot;Well, that&#39;s all the
formal toasts... does anyone else have anything to say?&quot;
	&quot;UM!&quot; Shinobu blurted, reacting to the cue she&#39;d coached
herself for, then blushing and sinking low in her seat when all
eyes turned to her. Oh, she just wanted to die, she couldn&#39;t do
this...
	&quot;Shinobu-chan?&quot; Keitaro smiled at her, and it just made
it worse, his honest happiness that one of his friends would have
something to add to his happy day.
	&#39;I can&#39;t say this, I CAN&#39;T, I&#39;ll just say it was an
accident, or wish them well, I can&#39;t say it, I-&#39;
	She suddenly felt a warm, wrinkled hand gently rest atop
hers, and turned, surprised, to find Grandmother Hina at her
side.
	&quot;It&#39;s alright, dear.&quot; The kindly old woman smiled at her,
and nodded her wizened head once. &quot;Just say what you feel.&quot;
	Those few words filled her with strength, and as if by
magic, the blush faded, and Shinobu sat up straight, nodding her
head once. She pushed back her chair and stood, taking a moment
to straighten her blue and white kimono, then held a hand
daintily in front of her mouth as she cleared her throat.
	&quot;... Everyone. I... I have something to say.&quot; She took a
deep breath, keeping her gaze slightly down, not allowing herself
to be intimidated by all the eyes on her. &quot;When I came to Hinata
Inn several years ago, I was very scared, and I was hurting. My
parents were split up, and my mother was moving, taking me away
from everything I knew. But... Keitaro-senpai, he helped me. He
gave me a home here, and... because he did that...&quot;
	She gulped, fighting the urge to cry, trying to swallow
the emotion that welled up. &quot;Because he did that, he also gave me
a family. Naru... Kitsune... Motoko... Sara... Kaolla.&quot; She
looked up, finding a smile for her friend... lover... then around
at the others. &quot;You&#39;ve all treated me like I was your sister...
your friend. You&#39;ve given me the happiest, best years of my life.
	&quot;That&#39;s what makes this day so special. Two of the best
people I know, Keitaro-senpai and Naru-senpai, they&#39;re married
now. And I just know that they&#39;re going to have a happy life.
It&#39;s like... it&#39;s like all the joy inside me at having such
wonderful friends, it&#39;s magnified a thousand times because of
this! It&#39;s the happiest day not only for them... but I think for
all of us here. The family that has formed at the Hinata Inn.&quot;
	She had to stop and take a deep breath again, heard the
rapt silence of the entire attendance. &quot;And that&#39;s why it&#39;s so
hard for me to tell you this. I&#39;m... leaving the Hinata Inn.&quot;
	Shinobu heard gasps from all her friends, and hung her
head further down, letting her bangs shadow her eyes. &quot;My mother
and father... they&#39;ve reconciled, and my family... it&#39;s going to
be a REAL family again!&quot; She forced herself to look up. She
wouldn&#39;t hide the tears in her eyes... it wasn&#39;t fair to the
people she loved. &quot;I love you all dearly, and you have been my
family... but now, my... my blood relations, they need me. My
help, and my love. And I have to go be with them. We&#39;re going to
be living in Tokyo, and I just... I can&#39;t be here, and be there
as well.&quot;
	There was silence, broken only by several murmurs of
&quot;Shinobu-chan.&quot; She looked around, and saw the sadness on their
faces, and slowly, she smiled.
	&quot;Please don&#39;t be sad... not on this special day. I told
you all today because... even though I&#39;m sad that I&#39;m leaving,
I&#39;m also very happy. I wanted to share both my sadness and my
happiness with you all... because that&#39;s what we&#39;ve always done.
Shared all we had. And though it&#39;s made us sad at times... it&#39;s
brought us closer together. I&#39;ll still come and see you! I
promise! Please... don&#39;t be sad that I&#39;m leaving, but instead,
share in all the happiness that I have.&quot;
	&quot;Kaolla will go to Tokyo, too, then!&quot;
	All eyes turned to the dark-skinned blonde as she stood
up and made that proclamation, causing even more murmurs.
	&quot;K... Ka-chan,&quot; Shinobu murmured, blinking repeatedly.
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;
	&quot;Kaolla loves Shinobu,&quot; the other girl said simply,
smoothly, as if stating that the stars would come out at night or
that Keitaro would put his foot in his mouth. &quot;Shinobu is
Kaolla&#39;s best friend. Kaolla can&#39;t let Shinobu go off to Tokyo
alone! First time Shinobu sees a dark street corner she&#39;ll go
&#39;WAAAAAA!&#39;&quot; Kaolla flapped her arms wildly and unfocused her
eyes, the accuracy of the Shinobu impression causing no small
number of giggles and snickering.
	Kaolla went from her flailing right back into grinning
earnestness. &quot;So Kaolla will go to Tokyo with Shinobu, and be
with her there, so that Shinobu will always have part of Hinata
Inn, and her family here, with her.&quot;
	&quot;Ka-chan,&quot; the indigo-haired girl whispered, feeling her
eyes fill with tears again.
	Kitsune stood, holding up her glass. &quot;Well then...
Shinobu-chan! What can we say but... we love you too! And you&#39;ll
make us all... your family... proud someday!&quot;
	&quot;I second that,&quot; Motoko added smoothly, rising from her
own seat. &quot;Shinobu, I have always seen a wonderful kindness and
tenderness in you that few have, and I have cherished having you
as a friend because of it. The strength of your heart dwarfs the
strength of my sword.&quot;
	&quot;Yeah, well!&quot; Sara shouted as she climbed up on her chair
and waved her glass around wildly, her blonde ponytails shaking.
&quot;You just better come and see me a lot, or I&#39;ll kick yer butt!&quot;
	&quot;Never take up smoking,&quot; Haruka offered, deadpan, as she
took a long drag on your cigarette. &quot;Dirty habit, and it doesn&#39;t
suit a wonderful young woman like you.&quot;
	&quot;Shinobu, from what I&#39;ve seen, you have a thoughtful
nature to go with your kind heart,&quot; Seta said as he offered his
own toast. &quot;Any art school, any class you ever wish to attend, I
will give references that assure your entry.&quot;
	&quot;Such a bunch of things happening,&quot; Mutsumi murmured as
she stood. &quot;Shinobu-chan, always make sure to keep in good...
health...&quot; And with that, she swooned smoothly back into her
chair in a faint.
	Naru coughed, and prodded Mutsumi in the arm until she
came around enough to listen to what everyone else had to say.
She looked to Keitaro, and both nodded, bride and groom rising as
one and putting their hands together.
	&quot;Shinobu-chan,&quot; Naru began with a smile. &quot;Though it makes
us sad that you&#39;re leaving, you&#39;ve also made us so happy today.&quot;
	&quot;Hai,&quot; Keitaro continued, smiling brightly, his eyes
shimmering behind his glasses. &quot;You told us from your heart just
how much we&#39;ve all meant to you.&quot;
	&quot;You really have made this the happiest day of our
lives,&quot; Naru picked up. &quot;We never knew just what a difference
we&#39;ve made in your life.&quot;
	&quot;But now we do. What a wonderful gift you&#39;ve given us,
Shinobu-chan.&quot;
	&quot;Hai... the gift of words from your heart.&quot;
	&quot;We love you, too, Shinobu-chan.&quot;
	&quot;We love you so much... imouto.&quot;
	&quot;Hai. Imouto.&quot;
	&quot;Imouto,&quot; chorused Kitsune, winking.
	&quot;Imouto,&quot; Motoko agreed solemnly.
	&quot;Imouto,&quot; Mutsumi whispered, smiling pleasantly.
	&quot;Oneechaaaaaan!&quot; Sara sang, smirking.
	Shinobu looked from one face to another, seeing their
smiles, the love shining in their eyes. She felt fingers entwine
with hers, and looked to her side to see Kaolla, leaning in to
kiss her cheek. And Shinobu broke down crying. She would remember
it forever as both the happiest and saddest day of her life. The
day that she found out just how much everyone at Hinata Inn loved
her. And the day she had to leave them all.

	&quot;It was much harder than I thought to come and visit,&quot;
Shinobu told her daughter, voice thick with emotion, her eyes
shining with tears. &quot;I managed it sometimes, but never again were
we all together like we were that day. Keitaro and Naru... the
lady you&#39;re named after... moved to another part of Tokyo than I
lived in, to be closer to Todai. Kitsune was kanrinin for awhile,
and then left with Seta and Haruka to go on a dig in Mexico, and
of course Sara went with them. Motoko went back to her family&#39;s
school, and became a great teacher. Mutsumi went back to her
island to start a turtle farm.&quot;
	&quot;Momma?&quot; Naru stared at her mother, not sure if the tears
in her eyes were cause to break out sobbing or not. &quot;Are you
sad?&quot;
	&quot;Just a little bit,&quot; Shinobu answered with a smile,
quickly wiping her eyes, then kissing her daughter&#39;s forehead. &quot;I
still see all of them sometimes, but never again have we all
managed to be together in one place. And in the last few years,
we haven&#39;t managed to get together at all. I do so want them to
see you now, Naru...&quot;
	&quot;Shinobuuuuuu!&quot;
	Kaolla hurried up, laughing and smiling, plucking the
equally delighted Naru from the other woman&#39;s arms as the little
girl squealed &quot;Poppa! Poppa!&quot;
	&quot;Don&#39;t let her call you that, you&#39;ll confuse her!&quot;
Shinobu protested, giving her spouse a Look.
	&quot;If she&#39;s not confused by having two mothers, calling me
&#39;poppa&#39; isn&#39;t gonna hurt her,&quot; Kaolla shot back as always,
smirking and sticking her tongue out at Shinobu as she rubbed
cheeks with her daughter, dark skin on dark skin. She had to stop
as Naru began grabbing and kicking, and concentrated on helping
her daughter up onto her shoulders.
	&quot;If she&#39;s not confused when we explain just what exactly
her actual relationship to her &#39;uncle&#39; is, she&#39;s a smarter little
girl than either of us ever were,&quot; Shinobu muttered, throwing her
hands up.
	&quot;Speak for yourself,&quot; Kaolla replied cheerfully as Naru
laughed and looked around from her higher vantage point. &quot;I was
always a genius!&quot;
	&quot;Evil genius,&quot; Shinobu added affectionately, kissing the
other woman on the cheek. &quot;Did you get the paperwork all worked
out?&quot;
	&quot;Yup! Just awaiting your signature!&quot; Kaolla continued
balancing her daughter on her shoulders with one hand, digging in
her jacket with the other. After a moment, she proffered the
carefully-folded sheet of paper to her spouse. &quot;Sign at the X,
and you and I are 100% owners of the Hinata Inn.&quot;
	Smiling softly, Shinobu unfolded the sheet of paper and
glanced over it, digging around in her pockets for a pen. Coming
up with one, she motioned for Kaolla to turn around so that she
could use her spouse&#39;s back as a flat surface.
	As she was putting the last stroke on &#39;Maehara&#39;, she felt
Kaolla suddenly go stiff in front of her. She opened her mouth to
ask what was wrong, only to be interrupted by a question from
Naru.
	&quot;Momma, poppa, who&#39;s that coming up the steps?&quot;
	Blinking, Shinobu straightened enough, again on the edge
of speech, about to ask what her daughter meant. Before she
could, Kaolla took a step to one side, and Shinobu let her pen
fall from limp fingers to clatter on the stones of the porch.
	And then she was being hugged, and kissed, having her
hair ruffled, her hands taken, and Kitsune was laughing, and
Motoko was thumping her on the back, and Mutsumi was just
standing there smiling at it all as if she couldn&#39;t imagine
anything more perfect, and Sara was picking her up off her feet
to hug her, and Haruka actually put out her cigarette to come in
for a hug, and Seta was telling her how beautiful she had become,
and Keitaro and Naru were both hugging her at once, and children
were clustered about her asking was it her, was it aunt Shinobu,
aunt Shinobu can I have a hug, aunt Shinobu we haven&#39;t seen you
in so long!
	And Shinobu was crying, just crying. She&#39;d thought that
nothing could eclipse the day when she&#39;d found out just how much
they all loved her, or the day when she took Kaolla&#39;s hand and
said now and forever, or the day when she&#39;d first held her
daughter in her arms. But this did. This was beyond happiness. It
was beyond anything she&#39;d ever felt in her whole life. Her
family... her whole family... had come home.
