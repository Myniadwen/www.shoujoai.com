<h1>Angel Light, Angel Dark (part 5 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../lovehina/index.html">Love Hina</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kanako.html">Kanako Urashima</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../lovehina/litedark-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Kanako paced along the walkways of the park, hands in her pockets, the 
wind in her hair, the sun warming her cold nerves. She had to get 
away, to go somewhere that allowed her to think for a moment. And the 
Maehara household was not that place. Shinobu&#146;s smile and overall kind 
demeanor distracted her, Shinji&#146;s eyes, the eyes that reminded Kanako 
so much not only of Yoichi but of every single person she ever killed, 
terrified her to the core and Miho&#146;s mere presence was too much of a 
puzzle for her to resist trying to solve it. No, the three of them 
distracted Kanako too much. She had to contemplate her next move in 
this chess game. Once Hinata Sou had been rebuilt, she can expect 
Shinobu to visit often or even move in, so she had to resolve her 
confusion by then. Otherwise, she may not be able to take the guilt. 
Shinobu and the others had to know by then. She had no intention of 
running away but she had to be ready to do so.

&#147;Four years is a long time.&#148; A low, almost hushed voice called out to 
her. &#147;Do you still have the rifle?&#148;

&#147;Himezaki&#133;&#148; Kanako&#146;s voice turned ice cold.

&#147;I am pleased you still remember me. I thought you might have 
forgotten about your old friend.&#148; He smiled malignantly.

He was slightly taller than Kanako was, with his black hair cut short, 
his eyes cold, bitter and over-used. His skin was pale, a product of 
years of spending far too much time in underground rooms, basements 
and other similarly dark areas, working on things that would make most 
other people shudder. His hands smelled of gunpowder, the black rings 
under his eyes a mark of many years of depriving himself of sleep. He 
had an unremarkable appearance, he had no real distinguishing features 
other than his height but the way he bent most of his upper body 
downwards made for a unique method of compensating. He was the 
ultimate &#147;gray&#148; man, capable, virtually, of blending in with almost 
any crowd. His clothing was equally simple, a plain black shirt and 
khakis, all the more to help him fade into the crowd. The way he 
looked at Kanako was one that bore no malice, no ulterior motives, no 
secrets hidden, it was just a look. However, she knew better. This was 
not your typical man; this man was the very definition of insane.

&#147;What do you want?&#148; she asked.

&#147;To catch up.&#148; He answered. &#147;I assume you&#146;ve made some money after the 
kaisho got caught. You bought that run down old inn, after all.&#148;

&#147;Kana, your insanity never ceases to amaze me.&#148;

&#147;Hehe&#133;&#148; he leaned his body on one of the many trees along the walkway 
as Kanako sat by a bench. &#147;Lucky you, you got away with money. Still, 
I did find an industry that needed my&#133;talents.&#148;

&#147;Demolitions, I assume?&#148;

Kanako knew him well. The two of them once worked together in cleaning 
up a few loose ends, as Kana once put it. He was the Kamakura&#146;s 
resident bomb maker, explosives expert and was far beyond your typical 
homicidal psychopath. He was a creative genius, his intelligence was 
something Kanako appreciated, if feared only a little. It was a shame; 
his creativity was transformed into deviousness in the manner in which 
he concocted bombs, explosives and grenades in all shapes and sizes. 
His subtlety was the only thing that could match his malicious 
insanity, Kanako would always see what he would let everyone else see 
but behind that, behind the apparent madness, was a method that was 
probably beyond even his comprehension. As he kept his silence for a 
moment, as if planning what to say next, that mind of his warped 
itself and he blurted out the first thing to come to mind.

&#147;I&#146;ve made a nice income for myself, selling my formula for edible, 
gelatinous napalm.&#148; The vindictive madman clearly felt proud of it. 
&#147;It&#146;s the ultimate pyrotechnic poison.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s the only pyrotechnic poison.&#148; Kanako said as if she didn&#146;t care. 
&#147;Still, it would be an excellent way to get rid of smokers.&#148;

Kanako didn&#146;t like being around him, it made her queasy for many 
reasons. If her sniper rifle was a grim reminder, Shinji&#146;s smile a 
dreadful, choking specter then this man&#146;s mere presence was possibly 
the most intense reminded of her guilt over her sins and the insanity 
that threatened to encroach her every waking moment. He was as close 
to absolute, pure evil incarnate as she would ever meet. The yakuza, 
any criminal for that matter, killed for a purpose that, in some 
strange, twisted way, made sense to her but Kana was different. He 
made his explosives to kill and he killed for no reason other than the 
fact that he wanted to see people die. He enjoyed listening over and 
over again to their screams as they burned to death or were consumed 
by the destructive forces of his bombs. Kanako would not be at all 
surprised to know that Kana was carrying a grenade or two somewhere in 
him. In fact, she would be shocked if he wasn&#146;t.

&#147;Leave me alone.&#148; Kanako insisted.

&#147;Fine then, Kanako, I&#146;ll leave.&#148; Kana said as he began to walk away. 
&#147;By the way, do you remember a man by the name of Takenori Yoichi?&#148;

That name again. Kana smiled at her, which Kanako hated. He was mad, 
in any definition of the word, and he wasn&#146;t suffering from insanity. 
As he so eloquently put it once, he was not suffering from insanity, 
rather, he was enjoying every minute of it. Kanako hated him for many 
reasons but under the surface, deep within her own mind, within that 
part of her that was already embracing insanity, she feared becoming 
like him in the end. Warped by his own genius, twisted by his 
thoughts, Kanako feared that one day, if she was not careful, she 
might become just the same as him. Then, as she closed her eyes, she 
recalled Shinobu, the image, the crystal clear memory of her sweet 
smile, it was a memory she clung to in all those years. She would like 
to believe she was a different person then, that her cold hearted 
willingness to kill was just a phase she had stepped out of. Then, he 
showed a proud smile at her, making her wonder what was the situation 
when she last saw that madman smile that way?

&#147;Impressive work, wasn&#146;t it?&#148;

&#147;If you can call such a sloppy headshot impressive piece of work, then 
yes.&#148; Kanako answered with no indication of pride in that kill, or 
anything else, for that matter.

&#147;Sloppy? Have you ever seen a grander explosion? I find pride in what 
I did to him.&#148; Kana said with a proud grin. &#147;It wasn&#146;t your bullet 
that did that man in.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll be going now.&#148;

&#147;Wait! Answer me Kana!&#148;

As Kanako followed him out of the park, she was amazed at how much 
distance he had covered in such a small span of time. She didn&#146;t trust 
him, he may well have been lying after all, but if Kana was telling 
the truth, then she didn&#146;t have anything to fear from being around 
Shinobu, Miho and Shinji. He vanished into the crowd but Kanako 
desperately tried to lock her line of sight with his location. Looking 
around furiously, she tried to move forward in that sea of humanity 
when she bumped into someone. She felt her body bounce off of 
something and as she looked at what it was that she bumped into, she 
saw Kana slowly vanish. He turned around with a grin before walking 
around the corner. Kanako gave chase but as she was about to run, a 
soft touch took hold of her wrist and stopped her. She turned her head 
to see the angelic face of Maehara Shinobu, who looked a little 
confused but otherwise was her usual endearing self.

&#147;Kanako-san is anything the matter?&#148; she asked.

&#147;What?&#148; Kanako turned her head, looking out at the corner. She gave 
out a sigh of disappointment as she realized Kana&#146;s trail was cold 
now. &#147;No, nothing is wrong. What brings you here?&#148;

&#147;I came looking for you. We still have so much to catch up on, after 
all.&#148; She answered. &#147;Well? Why don&#146;t we take a walk together?&#148;

Kanako didn&#146;t answer but Shinobu didn&#146;t feel any resistance, which she 
took as a good sign. She wanted to spend time with Kanako, it was her 
goal to help the dark one recover from the trauma of her past. She 
felt the same way Kanako was feeling now, once in her life. She knew 
what it felt like to think that the world doesn&#146;t care about you, to 
feel that your existence doesn&#146;t matter, to feel that no one would 
care if she were to die. She wanted to show Kanako that she did 
matter, that someone would cry at her funeral, that people cared about 
her. If not everyone in Hinata Sou, then at least she would show that 
she, Maehara Shinobu, her complete opposite, cared about her deeply. 
She held on to Kanako&#146;s hand, which slowly curled its fingers to hold 
on to her hand as well. It was a gesture that showed that the dark one 
appreciated what she had been doing. Kanako&#146;s touch was warm, a 
contrast to her ice cold presence.

Shinobu admired those hands. Those hands that could create wonders 
from simple make-up yet were the same hands that could destroy several 
blocks of ice with ease. Kanako was a contrast, a walking 
contradiction. She isolated herself from everyone but inside, the 
driving force within her was the longing to be with that one person 
who would love her for herself, darkness and all. Perhaps it was 
motherly instinct, perhaps it was something more but Shinobu wanted to 
just hold Kanako in her arms, letting the other girl simply cry on her 
shoulder, to let all her angst out, to comfort that solemn heart. She 
moved a little closer, as did Kanako, neither doing it consciously. 
Shinobu looked at Kanako&#146;s face, seeing not the face of a manipulator 
but the face of a person who has lost her way. She hadn&#146;t noticed much 
of what they were doing as she held Kanako&#146;s hand as they walked when 
suddenly, she tripped. Kanako managed to catch her in a tight, saving 
embrace before she fell into the lake.

&#147;Kanako-san&#133;&#148;

&#147;Shinobu-chan&#133;&#148;

Did she blush as she saw Kanako blush? Did she think Kanako felt their 
bodies press against one another? Did she realize that Kanako too was 
feeling the urge to move their lips closer to one another but was 
fighting against it? Shinobu didn&#146;t know the answer to these questions 
but she did know one thing: the warmth, the security of Kanako&#146;s 
embrace reminded her of her first love, Keitaro&#146;s embrace. Rarely did 
she feel so secure, so cared for, so&#133;loved than when she was in 
Keitaro&#146;s or Kanako&#146;s embrace. Only one other person had ever made her 
feel any safer than that, a person to whom she gave her heart and soul 
to but that person didn&#146;t respond the way that Shinobu expected. That 
person had the audacity, perhaps even the arrogance, to break 
Shinobu&#146;s heart. Now, the fear of that happening again didn&#146;t exist, 
as Kanako&#146;s lips slowly drew to hers as she drew her own lips towards 
Kanako&#146;s.

When they stop and stare - don&#39;t worry me

&#147;Shinobu-chan&#133;I&#133;&#148;

Cause I&#39;m feeling for her what she&#39;s feeling for me

&#147;Kanako-san&#133;I&#133;&#148;

&#147;There you two are.&#148; Miho&#146;s voice suddenly interrupted. &#147;What are you 
two doing?&#148;

&#147;Oh, we weren&#146;t doing anything.&#148; Kanako answered for the both of them 
as she helped Shinobu up from the ground. She noticed Miho&#146;s lack of 
suspicion about anything as Shinobu&#146;s hand touched hers for a moment 
and then pulled away. &#147;I had better go see if my things have arrived 
already.&#148;</pre>
