<h1>The Flower and the Swordsman</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../lovehina/index.html">Love Hina</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yellowpenguin.html">Yellow Penguin</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Introduction:
This is my first fan fiction so let me know if you like it(I might make 
a  sequel then). In book 13 the two interact as Kanako tries to help 
Motoko out. While Motoko and Keitaro are studying, Keitaro spills a 
drink all over Motoko and has to change. After beating over the head for 
seeing her topless, she asks him how he feels about Naru. After Keitaro 
declares his love for her, her gothic godmother sweeps in to comfort the 
ronin and use the opportunity to declare her heart&#146;s desire. My sister 
gave me the idea for the pairing (thanks Misty!)

Aishiteru= love someone, often meaning I love you if said directly to 
someone, has the subject and a particle before it if its unclear who the 
declarer loves

Goshikku= gothic (from Gothic and Lolita bible)
Hana = flower
Goshikku o hana = gothic flower (Motoko&#146;s nickname for Kanako)
Arigatoo = thank you
Baka = stupid
Desu yo = is ( a way of saying x is y for sure)
Ima = now
Matsudai = forever
Ima to matsudai = now and forever
Wa is a particle that is used in Japanese sentences to indicate the 
subject, and the word after it doesn&#146;t need one

In case you become interested in Japanese, I highly recommend Genki&#146;s An 
Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese to get started as well as Basic 
Kanji book by Bojinsha co. to help learn the kanji. Arigatoo and thanks 
for reading!


&#147;What&#133; I know I&#146;m ok with them being together, but I&#146;m crying&#133;&#148;

As she screams at Keitaro not to look at her, he trips over his crossed 
legs and lands straight between her exposed bosom; perhaps tomorrow the 
members of Hinata House will see if he survived Motoko&#146;s Total 
Annihilation cutting slash, second form.

(somewhere, deep within the ruins of Macchu Pichu, a man spoke: nice 
form) -Seta san 

&#147;I hate that bastard! No matter what, his very existence plagues my life 
as well as his lame accidents. Ahh, I hate that man!&#148;

The door slid open, and in stepped the Victorian maiden, Kanako. &#147;Hmmm, 
what&#146;s the matter Motoko? How are things with Keitaro going?&#148; she 
teased, knowing already her reply.

&#147;Ehh? Keitaro wa baka desu yo,&#148; retorted the violated ronin. &#147;That 
little prick always finds some way to ruin my day, like some kind of 
plague!&#148;

&#147;Motoko, why are you so harsh on him. We all know you love him too.&#148;

&#147;Demo, he loves Naru and who would want to be around a horny imp all 
day?&#148;

While saying this, Kanako began to walk about Motoko&#146;s room and couldn&#146;t 
resist a few glances upon the swordsman&#146;s naked form.

&#147;Well I suppose he is a bit of an ass for neglecting everyone else&#146;s 
feelings for that ditz. Judging from your well endowed breasts and 
shaped physique, I can&#146;t blame him for his petty accidents he has just 
to feel you and up,&#148; she subtly added. Blushing a deep crimson, Motoko 
suddenly realized her uncovered state, and quickly grabbed the dry shirt 
she never got to put on. Although she realized the intent behind the 
statement, she quickly dismissed it as a misunderstanding. &#147;Ano, Kanako 
san, why are you so nice to me? I know you love Keitaro too, yet you 
comfort me without regard of the fact that I would take him if I had the 
chance.&#148;

&#147;Oh, of course you would,&#148; the goth retorted, as she drew closer towards 
the source of this brash statement. &#147;Just one question Motoko: what do 
you have against me?&#148;

&#147;What do I have against you? What do you think? You took my chastity 
damnit! Of course I&#146;d be supicious as to why you&#146;re helping me.&#148;

Her words cut into Kanako like shrapnel, tears welling.

&#147;Kanako&#133; I&#146;m sorry, it&#146;s just, with Keitaro always leading me on, it&#146;s 
all such mess. Don&#146;t cry&#133;&#148;

Feeling sorry for her, Motoko embraces the distressed girl. Staring into 
Motoko&#146;s eyes, she blurted,

&#147;Regardless of my charity, you question my motives without regard for my 
feelings and how I feel. Don&#146;t you think I might feel pain from your 
interrogating assaults? I&#146;m sorry for what I&#146;ve done&#148; Surprised by the 
sudden outburst, Motoko flushed, blood running hotly to her cheeks. 

&#147;I had no idea Kanako. I am deeply apologetic to your suffering. It&#146;s 
just that you&#146;re so kind to me; no one has ever shown such affection to 
me. Watashi&#133;&#148; As she trailed off, the Victorian maiden stared deeply 
into Motoko&#146;s eyes, both faces intensifying in heat and hue. &#147;Kanako&#133;?&#148;

&#147;Motoko, I feel&#133; this pain, this tinge in my heart seeing you so upset. 
I don&#146;t know, I just feel that Keitaro has led you on, especially after 
he has hurt you so, which hurts me.&#148;

&#147;I&#133;&#148; trailed the astonished swordsman, as she struggled for something to 
say. &#147;What is there to say, Kanako. I never had known. I should&#146;ve been 
more sensitive, not a heartless fool, disregarding your feelings like I 
just did.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t say that Motoko! Don&#146;t you see how I feel?!&#148; wailed Kanako, as 
her eyes began to water. &#147;watashi&#133;watashi&#133;&#148;

&#147;Just say how you feel, Kanako san,&#148; astounded by the foreshadowed 
revelation yet aroused by the girl&#146;s bold front.

&#147;I&#133; I love you Motoko!&#148; the maiden cried, embracing her love. She 
pressed her lips passionately against Motoko&#146;s, locked for what seemed 
an eternity. Slowly, Kanako disengaged the bewildered ronin, who felt 
both awe and bewilderment at this new advance.

&#147;What are you doing to-&#147;

&#147;Hush, Motoko.&#148; Whispering sweetly into Motoko&#146;s ear, &#147;(Onegaishimasu, I 
know you probably loathe me, but I must confess, ever since I saw your 
despair over Keitaro when you returned, I developed this love that has 
built up inside me for-)&#147; 

Before she could finish her sweet whispering, Motoko cut her short by 
returning the show of affection with her own, which threw Kanako off 
balance. They fell to the ground, tongues lashing, hair amok. Kanako 
began to stroke Motoko&#146;s hair while the ronin lay on top, intensely 
aroused. 

&#147;Mmmm, ronin girl, I thought you don&#146;t swing that way,&#148; the Victorian 
Maiden cooed, which Motoko replied,

 &#147;Well, if that&#146;s the case I could just stop now. After all, I am on 
top.&#148; 

All too quickly the tables turned, Kanako straddled over her now willing 
lover, staring into those eager eyes. 

&#147;Can you now? You&#146;ve been a mischievous samurai, Motoko. I think you 
need some discipline.&#148; With that, Kanako reached for Motoko&#146;s unsheathed 
breasts under the loose shirt, fondling them while Motoko let out a 
stifled moan.

 &#147;Yesssss, discipline me.&#148; 

She stretched her arms and Kanako lifted off the cover, revealing two 
erect nipples. Tossing the shirt aside unceremoniously, the controlling 
kneaded the ronin&#146;s breasts; she arched her back and moaned as Kanako 
began sucking on the right nipple in swirling motions and playful nips. 
Struggling to breath, Motoko let out a whimper as her body quaked for 
release. Sensing her wanton lust, Kanako rose up to Motoko&#146;s face, 
entangled in flowing dark hair. Pulling her closer, the Ronin began to 
tear off Kanako&#146;s dress, who seemed too enamored to care. After ten 
minutes of juggling the maiden&#146;s passionate tongue lashings and her 
complex outfit, it lay in tatters across the floor, revealing a pale 
physique, quivering with reckless abandon. Deciding she had toyed with 
the ronin long enough, she stood up to remove what undergarments 
remained, then jumped back on top of things, with Motoko moaning in 
carnal pleasure as Kanako began to work on her left breast&#146;s hard 
nipple. Finishing with such trivial pursuits, she began to advance 
towards Motoko&#146;s inner thighs, kissing and stroking the ronin&#146;s smooth 
stomach along the way, causing tremors of pure pleasure. As she worked 
her way towards her main goal, she slowly pulled of Motoko&#146;s final 
shields of virginity, the pain of waiting was becoming too much. Upon 
tossing it aside, she delicately set to work, devouring Motoko&#146;s 
aromatic scent and sweet taste. The moans continued. As Kanako began to 
spread her lover&#146;s lips and lap deeper, it sent Motoko into passionate 
throes as she climaxed. As Kanako licked up all the fluids, the goth 
carefully slid two fingers into her receptive lips as she ascended to 
lock lips with her lover. Pulling away, Motoko gasped,

&#147;Kanako, I just want to say&#133; arigatoo, and&#133;&#148;

&#147;I think it&#146;s time I had some fun,&#148; finished the blushing maiden. Motoko 
giggled as Kanako slid across the ronin&#146;s stomach, their hips 
connecting. Kanako let out a moan of carnal knowledge as she began to 
grind, back and forth. Motoko, admiring the pale maiden&#146;s body body, 
noticed her large breasts bouncing rhythmically, which caused her to 
groan sensuously. It started slow and low. Then the performance began to 
crescendo, breathing quickens, moans intensify, breasts bounce faster. 
The performance reaches such a fever pitch their cries echo across the 
dormitory. The two fall in a heap on top of each other, their hair 
matted with sweat.

&#147;Aishiteru, Motoko Aoyama.&#148;

&#147;goshikku no hana, aishiteru.&#148;

Laughing at her new nickname, Kanako lost herself in her lover&#146;s arms, 
the satiated swordsman soon following suit, gripping tightly so as to 
never let her go. In the final wails of utter indulgence, the Hinata 
Houses&#146; residents ran amok towards Motoko&#146;s room to their companions&#146; 
aide. 

What they saw amazed all, aroused some, and inspired others to declare 
their undying convictions.

&#147;WHAAAAAA-&#147; Naru took care of her rude boyfriend, guaranteeing that he 
wouldn&#146;t be seen until the light of day. Contemplating the ramifications 
of the union before her, she began crying, distraught over the loss of 
her companions who had helped her through her boyfriend&#146;s inability to 
&#147;deliver the goods.&#148; 

Drunk as ever, Kitsune swoons and falls onto Shinobu who falls with her 
drunken friend on top. In an inviting tone, Kitsune mumbles, 

&#148;(Mmm, Shinobu, you&#146;re looking fine tonight. You know I can rock your 
world. Why don&#146;t you let big momma take care of you for the night.)&#148; 

Brushing lightly against her lips, Kitsune turns scarlet as she stares 
into Shinobu&#146;s big blue eyes. Shinobu blushes, extricates herself, and 
runs to her room blushing, Kitsune swaggering in pursuit. (maybe I&#146;ll 
make a side story, hehehe) 

&#147;Oh my,&#148; Mutsumi joked, complete with her &#147;fu fu fu&#148; laugh. Leaning down 
to Naru on the floor, she whispered playfully, &#147;(Oh Naru, I&#146;m so sorry 
that you feel this way. It hurts me to see you all torn with your 
boyfriend messing things up and losing your fellow companions. Always 
remember, I love you and my door is always unlocked for you.)&#148; With a 
laugh and wink, Mutsumi strode off.  Naru after recomposing herself, 
blushed and ran out of the room. 

&#147;Haruka, can I stay with you? Everyone else is doubled up tonight.&#148;

&#147;Sure, whatever. Seta hasn&#146;t been around for months and I doubt he&#146;ll 
care.&#148;

&#147;Yaaaay!&#148; cried the Monmol princess, who ran down towards Haruka&#146;s room. 
Before walking after, Haruka took one last glance and sighed:

Ah, to be young again.

Stirring, after that remark, the strewn lovers awoke, looking lovingly 
into each others&#146; gaze. 

&#147;Did you hear that, Kanako? Oh my gosh, my door&#146;s open! What if they&#133;&#148;

&#147;Who cares? They&#146;d find out anyways, and I&#146;m not letting anyone take you 
away from me, not even that heartbreaking bastard.&#148;

&#147;Heh, but I though he was the love of your life, you incestuous freak,&#148; 
Motoko teased.

&#147;Oh, you didn&#146;t hear? I could care less if he came in here naked right 
now, I&#146;m all yours and you&#146;re all mine, if you&#146;ll have me.&#148;

&#147;Goshikku no hana, Aishiteru. Ima to matsudai.

&#147;Call me that again and I just might have to discipline you again.&#148;

&#147;Anytime, any place, any where goshikku no hana&#148;

With that, the gothic flower pressed her lips and body to her lovers, 
then drifting off to her eternal bliss in the firm yet loving hands of 
her swordsman.

The Final Words:
Sooooo. This is my first. I&#146;d like to thank so many of the yuri writers 
here, they&#146;ve inspired me with their creative storylines and 
descriptions which stop me from using the same style and phrases over 
and over. I&#146;d also like to thank my sister for the Kanako/Motoko idea. 
Never thought it could happen, did you? As you can see, I left the 
ending over for many interpretations, as well as story branching. If I 
get some feedback and feel like it&#146;s worth it, I&#146;d love to continue the 
Gothic Flower/my favorite swordsman triste as well as try out the other 
pairs I put together. I also noticed my self and so many other writers 
killing off the guy characters. Maybe they need their own relationships, 
but that&#146;s obviously for another site and story. Thanks and please send 
feedback so I can make the sequel even better.
