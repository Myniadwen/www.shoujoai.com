<h1>Angel Light, Angel Dark (part 14 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../lovehina/index.html">Love Hina</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kanako.html">Kanako Urashima</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../lovehina/litedark-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>&#147;I have to go&#133;&#148; she sighed, running her fingers along the door&#146;s 
surface one last time. &#147;I&#146;m sorry. I&#146;m sorry for ever coming into your 
life, for making you feel so miserable.&#148;

Kanako sighed as she placed the small envelope of legal, financial and 
property documents into the Maehara household&#146;s mailbox. The storm was 
looming on the horizon, she could feel it. She picked up her massive 
suitcase full of her things, including her rifle, adjusted her fake 
glasses and prepared to go. She had no place here; she had no right to 
be here. Sorrowfully, she stepped back and unlocked the back area of 
her car. She had made arrangements to leave half ownership of Hinata 
Sou in Shinobu&#146;s name, as well as making her Swiss bank account a 
shared account. The necessary documents were all in the envelope she 
left behind, a way to make amends for what she had done. For 
disrupting their lives, for ever being there, for falling in love with 
her, though the last one she didn&#146;t really know if she regretted it.

&#147;Leaving?&#148;

That voice, it invoked so many bitter memories Kanako didn&#146;t even want 
to remember the name of the one who called her. She knew one of them 
would catch her, but did it have to be this one? Kanako slowly closed 
the door on the driver&#146;s side of the car, turned around and saw her: 
Aoyama Motoko. Once more, the question came to her: did it have to be 
you? It was a stand-off, both of them were broken souls, one more so 
than the other. There was very little light around them, the better 
for Kanako. Motoko approached slowly, her hands seemingly passing over 
the surface of Kanako&#146;s black hearse as if it were water. Kanako kept 
still, she didn&#146;t want to move from her place so she would be able to 
leave in a hurry. She could hear her heart racing nervously over the 
deathly hum of the engine. There was something in Motoko&#146;s eyes that 
was different from that time in the hospital; there was a realization 
there now that wasn&#146;t there before. Something, or someone, had changed 
Motoko&#146;s view on what was going on. One name came to Kanako&#133;

Maehara Miho.

That name made her think. Up to now, she had only noticed Miho&#146;s 
presence through the corner of her eye but she could always feel 
someone pulling the puppet strings on all the events that had been 
happening. She didn&#146;t feel forced though, she felt like she was simply 
going with the flow. Miho certainly had something up her sleeve and a 
purpose but that was beside the point. The point is that she was 
expecting Miho to be the one to catch her, not Motoko. Like any good 
chess master, Kanako decided to contemplate her next move. She didn&#146;t 
know what was going on right now; there was something about the way 
the energy of the moment felt to her that shook her mental faculties 
off balance. She hadn&#146;t been this mentally vulnerable in years; 
perhaps she never had been before. In any case, she could almost see 
Miho, smiling with those purple eyes from behind the fog that had 
begun to envelop them. She stopped that train of thought though and 
resumed focusing on what was at hand: Aoyama.

&#147;You should be happy.&#148; Kanako said with a clear note of displeasure at 
speaking those words. &#147;I&#146;ll be gone, no more corrupting influence upon 
Shinobu-chan. She&#146;s yours for the taking, Aoyama.&#148;

&#147;I have no right to claim what has already been given away.&#148;

&#147;Just go away and let me leave here in peace.&#148; Kanako answered, as if 
ignoring Motoko&#146;s statement. &#147;Can you at least grant me that?&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re making a big mistake, Kanako-san.&#148;

&#147;My first mistake was coming back here.&#148;

Finally, Kanako opened the door and got on the driver&#146;s seat 
reluctantly. She turned the key and proceeded to drive away, leaving 
Motoko in the trail of dust her hearse made as it moved. She kept her 
mind clear and focused her thoughts on what she was going to do. At 
least, that was the plan. Now, however, she realized she didn&#146;t have 
any place to go or anything to do. It didn&#146;t matter however; she was 
already booked with a first class ticket to Honolulu, Hawaii. She 
arrived at the airport, her bags looking more like lead weights rather 
than luggage bags. She looked at her ticket and proceeded to one of 
the boarding gates of the Hinata Airport, dragging the bags along the 
ground. It wasn&#146;t that she couldn&#146;t carry them or found them heavy; it 
was more the weight of leaving. She was breaking down inside but 
outside, she was as cold as steel. Then, her eyes caught sight of 
something that gave her a cold, dreadful chill.

&#147;Miho-san&#133;&#148;

&#147;Hello there, Kanako-chan.&#148; Miho stood there, nonchalantly, with that 
ever present smile. &#147;Are you going to run away?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t have anything to stay here for.&#148;

&#147;Are you sure? What about Shinobu-chan? Are you just going to forget 
about her?&#148; Miho stood there ominously, as if she was about to cut 
Kanako down. &#147;She has feelings for you, you know.&#148;

&#147;No.&#148; Kanako answered, unable to move away or against Miho&#146;s 
overwhelming presence. &#147;She loves someone else. She loves Aoyama.&#148;

All the things she said
All the things she said
Running through my head

Kanako knew in her heart that she really didn&#146;t believe what she was 
saying. Deep inside her, she knew that Shinobu loved her and not 
Motoko; she knew she felt the same way. In her heart, a heart that had 
been far too long shrouded in darkness for it&#146;s own good. Shinobu&#146;s 
kind words, the way those eyes looked at her with unprecedented 
concern, care, affection&#133;it was love, there was no doubt about it. Why 
was she running, however, if she knew all these things? Was she afraid 
of loving? Was she afraid of being betrayed? Was she afraid of 
betraying Shinobu? She didn&#146;t know the answers to these questions and 
as she looked into Miho&#146;s purple eyes, her hands trembled and she 
shook with a dreadful fear. She had begun to fear that smile, that 
gentle and loving expression. Perhaps, she had gone on too long 
without feeling that someone cared for her, she didn&#146;t know. She 
wondered, what was she so afraid of?

&#147;Are you afraid to love again, Kanako-chan?&#148; Miho asked, as if reading 
Kanako&#146;s mind. &#147;Has your heart been burned that badly? Or are you 
afraid&#133;that you&#146;ll be the one to burn her?&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t presume to know me, Miho-san&#133;&#148; Kanako said bitterly.

&#147;You&#146;re calling for help; I can see it, even if I can&#146;t hear it.&#148; Miho 
answered, her smile starting to wane. Kanako trembled at the sight of 
that, it was a sign that Miho was getting serious. &#147;Why do you deny 
yourself what is being given to you? Not every gift is a Trojan Horse, 
Kanako-chan.&#148;

And I&#39;m all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed
They say it&#39;s my fault but I want her so much

Kanako felt cornered, Miho was slowly closing in on her. She was 
breaking apart, she had already fallen to her knees and her eyes were 
beginning to moisten. Miho was right in what she was saying, she was 
afraid of being betrayed by Shinobu and of being the one to betray 
Shinobu. She hated that, being afraid. She wanted to give herself 
another chance at love, to risk breaking her heart all over again. She 
had barely recovered from the first time but she was determined to 
risk it again with Shinobu. Her tears began to run down her cheeks 
slowly as Miho stood there and simply observed. Kanako didn&#146;t even 
hear the last boarding call for her flight; she was too deep inside 
her own self, her own personal void to listen to such things. And yet, 
despite her blocking out almost everything, she heard footsteps. She 
heard footsteps made by traditional Japanese wooden sandals striking 
the floor of the airport. She clenched her fists, she knew Motoko was 
there. It felt like it was adding insult to injury.

&#147;What do you want, Aoyama?&#148; she asked with scorn.

&#147;I am not here for what you think I am here for.&#148; Motoko answered.

&#147;You are lying there, broken on the floor. Your heart has been 
shattered more times than you care to count and the shards are still 
embedded in your mind and soul. You don&#146;t want to feel that fire 
again; you don&#146;t want to be hurt like that again.&#148; Miho said as she 
took a chair and faced Kanako. The smile was gone, replaced by an 
expression infinitely similar to Kanako&#146;s. Stoic, cold, unreadable, 
secretive, this was Maehara Miho without the fa&ccedil;ade of the smile she 
wore like a mask. &#147;But you have to. Or else, you&#146;ll live your life 
empty, alone and forever damning yourself for running away from this 
chance.&#148;

&#147;I can&#146;t&#133;I&#133;think I killed him. I killed Takenori Yoichi. If not, then 
I helped kill him.&#148; Kanako admitted at last. &#147;I&#146;m the reason why 
Shinji-kun has no father&#133;&#148;

&#147;That doesn&#146;t matter. Not to me, not to Shinobu-chan, not to 
Shinji-kun.&#148; Miho answered, still keeping an incredibly hard stance. 
&#147;Shinji-kun is better off without a father anyway.&#148;

&#147;Shinobu-chan&#133;I don&#146;t deserve her.&#148; Kanako countered but in truth, she 
still wasn&#146;t convincing herself. &#147;I am a killer; even my being here is 
bringing danger to all of you.&#148;

&#147;Then&#133;then&#133;we will face those dangers together.&#148;

I keep asking myself, wondering how
I keep closing my eyes but I can&#39;t block you out

Those words, combined with the gentle hand touching her shoulder, she 
knew who this person was. She tried to close her eyes, to block out 
the image of the woman who was slowly becoming her saving angel. But 
in the end, she couldn&#146;t. In the end, she gave in, as her hand slowly 
came up to touch the hand on her shoulder, to feel it, press against. 
It was the greatest of comforts, to have felt that hand on her 
shoulder. She stood up, slowly, turning as she did so to face that 
angelic face, that subtle perfection of beauty. Yes, it was Shinobu&#146;s 
hand that touched her shoulder, more importantly though, it was 
Shinobu that touched her heart. That girl gave Kanako the strength to 
recover, the will to move on and forget about the pain she experienced 
with her past love. There she stood, Kanako&#146;s angel, her saving grace. 
In tears, Kanako grabbed and embraced Shinobu in her arms, letting her 
tears flow freely for the first time in what felt like so long a time. 

I could spend my life in this sweet surrender,
I could stay lost in this moment forever,
Where a moment spent with you is a moment I treasure,

&#147;I&#146;m sorry. I&#146;m sorry for everything.&#148; Kanako apologized as she faced 
Shinobu. &#147;I&#146;m sorry for everything I&#146;ve done.&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t have anything to be sorry for.&#148; Shinobu held Kanako&#146;s 
hands, her smile a light of hope in the darkness that had been 
Kanako&#146;s existence. &#147;You make me feel things I never thought I&#146;d feel 
again. Now, all I really want is just to feel your arms around me.&#148;

&#147;I want to hold you like this forever, Shinobu-chan.&#148; Kanako said as 
she held Shinobu close in her embrace, her hand along Shinobu&#146;s hair, 
a single tear that fell from her cheek running down Shinobu&#146;s now. &#147;I 
promise, I won&#146;t leave you, Shinobu-chan.&#148;

&#147;I won&#146;t let you go.&#148; Shinobu too began to cry. &#147;Not now, not ever.&#148;

&#147;Game over.&#148; Miho whispered into the air with a smile as she and 
Motoko walked away. &#147;May they live happily ever after.&#148;
