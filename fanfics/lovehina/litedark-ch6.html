Dear Diary,

Motoko-chan and I went shopping together today. Since Kanako-san&#146;s 
been gone, I&#146;ve been with Motoko-chan a lot. She has certainly become 
far more masculine nowadays, wearing some clothes that I swear were 
senpai&#146;s. It&#146;s strange really, she was so feminine before already but 
now, it seems like it&#146;s starting to wear off. If that&#146;s even possible!

Now that I think about it, I think I miss Kanako-san. I don&#146;t think 
anyone else does, even senpai barely seems to notice that she&#146;s gone. 
She hasn&#146;t really become a fixture, of sorts, around here. I don&#146;t 
think that anyone really noticed whatever it was she was doing when 
she was still here. Now that I think about it, I never really saw that 
much of her either.

It&#146;s not that I was avoiding her though. It felt more likes she was 
avoiding me. I wonder, was it something I said? Was it something I 
did? I probably shouldn&#146;t even try to figure it out. Senpai says 
Kanako-san&#146;s far too complex for anyone other than someone just like 
her to comprehend. She&#146;s a strange girl, that&#146;s for sure. I wonder why 
she left without even saying anything&#133;

Haruka-san says that Kanako-san&#146;s just doesn&#146;t have the skill. When I 
asked what she meant and what skill Kanako-san lacked, she answered 
&#147;she doesn&#146;t have the skill to be alive&#148;. I know I heard that from 
some show that Kanako-san liked, I just can&#146;t remember which one. It&#146;s 
a little embarrassing really, I like to think I know her the best 
among everyone here but&#133;I don&#146;t even know what sorts of things she 
likes. I don&#146;t even know her birthday.

I remember that senpai didn&#146;t know it either. Neither did Haruka-san. 
They said that the reason why is that Kanako-san always ran away 
whenever they would have a party for her as a child and eventually, 
they just decided to forget about it. I&#133;not to say I think they&#146;re 
lying but&#133;I think the real reason they don&#146;t know is that they just 
don&#146;t care to remember. I know that makes them sound cold but&#133;

I think everything Kanako-san does is to get people&#146;s attention. I am 
sure she feels alone and just wants someone to talk to her, to listen 
to her. I guess she wasn&#146;t ready to open up just yet. Maybe I was 
pushing too much, trying to be friendly and all. I can&#146;t help but 
think she thought I was up to something. I certainly hope she 
didn&#146;t&#133;I&#146;d hate for her to think that of me.

Anyway, Motoko-chan and I are alone together again. It was by pure 
coincidence, really. Senpai and Naru-senpai were invited to someone&#146;s 
dinner party. I&#146;m not sure but it was someone named&#133;Sakata Keitaro? 
I&#146;m not really sure. Kitsune-san decided to take Sara out (hopefully, 
not bar hopping!) and she decided to bring Mutsumi-san along with her. 
And Su-chan is visiting her family in Molmol so that leaves just&#133;me 
and Motoko-chan.

Now that I think about it, it seems like Motoko-chan and I end up 
alone with each other in Hinata Sou more and more often nowadays&#133;maybe 
it means something?

blush

Well, that&#146;s it for today. I still have finals tomorrow and management 
is a real weakness of mine. Too bad I can&#146;t ask senpai or Naru-senpai 
for help and Motoko-chan doesn&#146;t do too well on that subject either. I 
better study now; I can&#146;t really afford to fail in that subject.
