Was what I did wrong? Was it wrong for me to have given in to my own 
feelings like that? But isn&#146;t it wrong to deny myself those feelings? 
I won&#146;t lie. I enjoyed that kiss, every moment of it. I enjoyed being 
with Kanako-san. I love being around her, I love to comfort her, to 
hold her, I&#133;I&#133;do I love her?

I don&#146;t really know.

I don&#146;t think so. I didn&#146;t feel this way for senpai or Motoko-chan and 
I loved them, right? I never felt this drawn to someone, this 
attracted and this&#133;connected to someone before. Or maybe, I&#146;m only 
really falling in love for the first time with her&#133;I&#146;m confused; I 
wish I could ask for help.

Miho-chan&#133;

I didn&#146;t understand a word she said. I was too&#133;afraid. I never noticed 
just how much Miho-chan scared me before. The way she looked as 
Kanako-san, Motoko-chan and me as if she was going to cut right 
through the three of us. It was&#133;scary.

I don&#146;t know what to do anymore. I know I have feelings for Kanako-san 
and she has feelings for me too but I know that I still feel something 
for Motoko-chan. Things would have been so much simpler if I had never 
even thought of going back to Hinata Sou that day! Why couldn&#146;t I just 
leave the past alone?!

If I had never gone there, to reminisce, to remind myself of how much 
it hurt when Motoko-chan left me&#133;I would never have seen Kanako-san 
again. None of this would have happened. Maybe I could have even 
gotten back with Motoko-chan somehow. Isn&#146;t that what I want, another 
chance at love with her?

It&#146;s too late now. I&#146;ve run away again. I failed. I couldn&#146;t keep my 
promise to senpai never to run away again. I&#146;ve let him down. I&#146;ve let 
myself down. I&#146;ve let Miho-chan down. I&#146;ve let&#133;her down. Everything&#146;s 
falling apart now. Kanako-san refuses to see me; Motoko-chan hasn&#146;t 
said a word to me since then&#133;why?

Why must I always lose the people I care for? Why must I always be the 
one that loses the people I love? Our parents divorced because of me&#133;I 
lost senpai because I wasn&#146;t enough&#133;I didn&#146;t have the strength to show 
him how I truly felt&#133;now, I&#146;ve driven away two people I love and love 
me as well. It&#146;s so sad&#133;

Kanako-san&#133;

Why? Why do I feel so different around you? So calm, so serene, so 
loved, so alive. Why don&#146;t I feel this way when I&#146;m around someone 
else? Why do I care for you so much? Why did I even care for you back 
then? I should have just left things the way they were. Maybe then, I 
wouldn&#146;t be so&#133;hurt.

Motoko-chan&#133;

I have always admired your strength; I have always been attracted to 
it. Why? Why can&#146;t I have that strength too? I&#146;m so fragile, so weak. 
Did I really love you back then? Do I really love you now? Maybe I was 
just fooling myself into thinking that because&#133;I needed your strength 
to make me feel strong too.

Please, someone help me&#133;

I don&#146;t want to be alone&#133;

Kanako&#146;s Diary
Entry Date: Present

I, Urashima Kanako, am alone again.

It is my fate to be forever alone. I have come to accept that as a 
fact. My short lived kiss with Shinobu-chan was a nice reprieve from 
my misery but it wasn&#146;t meant to last. Nothing that good can ever 
last. This is especially true with my life. Fate has seen it fit to 
watch me slowly rot alive.

Why am I always the one who loses? I lost my biological parents. I 
never really had my foster parents. I had my onii-san but I lost him 
too. Now, I&#146;ve lost Shinobu-chan. Then again, I can never really claim 
I had her. I guess she was never really there, I could see it. Her 
heart still belongs to Motoko-chan.

I really should stop crying. It does not suit me. Crying is for the 
weak, for those who know that their hearts are still in the right 
place. I am not going to cry anymore. I&#146;ve cried enough in my life. 
For anyone in their right mind to love me, to truly love me, no matter 
what happens, that is just a dream of mine. Yet&#133;

&#147;The only difference between dreams and accomplishments is pure 
desire.&#148;

I don&#146;t think I can afford to believe in that anymore. It seems ironic 
as well, that the madman I loath would have had to be the one to tell 
those words to me. Pure desire&#133;I guess that&#146;s what drove him to become 
what he is now. His pure desire to be different, to be exceptional, to 
simply be himself is admirable.

I don&#146;t have my dreams anymore. I don&#146;t have any real accomplishments. 
In the end, I guess Kana is right about a lot of things concerning me. 
He and I are alike, in almost every way. We don&#146;t belong with anyone; 
we aren&#146;t mean to be happy. We are born alone and we die alone.

I&#146;ve made my decision. It allows for a fine compromise, I&#146;d like to 
think. It allows me to still have a part of it but ultimately, it is 
in her hands. I won&#146;t be bale to stay much longer. As soon as the 
repairs on Hinata Sou are complete, I should make the required 
arrangements, my assets, my Swiss bank account, everything.

I should never have thought that I could even come close to her. She 
and I are too different, oil and water don&#146;t mix. I can only hope that 
the arrangements I will make will be an adequate apology for what I 
have done to Shinobu-chan. I don&#146;t know any other way to show her how 
sorry I am.

I&#146;m afraid to go back to that void, that bleak existence. It&#146;s like 
the night sky without any of the stars. It offers me no comfort; there 
is no peace in the void. I should be happy for Shinobu-chan, she&#146;s 
found her love. As for myself, I&#146;ve lost mine. My only comforts 
now&#133;are the stars.

Why have I gone down this road? My childhood&#133;was so full of hopes and 
dreams. I was the best at everything, I could cook, I could fight and 
I was loved. I had so much promise, so much potential and I could feel 
it. I felt that I could reach for the stars in the night sky&#133;All&#146;s 
right with the world.

The year&#146;s at the spring,
And day&#146;s at the morn;
Morning&#146;s at seven;
The hillside&#146;s dew pearl&#146;d;
The lark&#146;s on the wing;
The snail&#146;s on the thorn;
God&#146;s in his Heaven &#150;
All&#146;s right with the world!
&#150; Robert Browning
