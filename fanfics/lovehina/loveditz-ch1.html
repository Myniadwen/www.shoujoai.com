** = some other time or place or person

Motoko sitting in her usual space in the back of the van, Haruka was 
driving as usual Naru was sitting by Keitaro. They were at there usual 
best, Motoko was stuck with Su sleeping on her right and Shinobu on her 
left. Kitsune was sitting in the front seat.

Motoko watched the trees from her spot in the middle of the back row of 
the van. She didn&#39;t mind it so much sitting in the middle of the two 
very short but very cute pair of girls.

It had come to her mind that she loved them all but wanted to protect 
them all. She had promised to protect them all but now it seamed that 
after a whale she noticed something. Something different between the 
girls.

Naru was with her Keitaro but Haruka had seamed to be paired up with 
Kitsune. They had been spending so much time together they acted a lot a 
like. Su and Shinobu also had seamed to be getting closer to one 
another. Motoko looked out the window yet again, only this time wishing 
that she had someone like everyone else.

They arrived at there destination it was there usual spot on the beach 
the broken down tea house. Motoko stretched sitting down made her so 
tired she didn&#39;t really like to sit for so long.

Kitsune &quot;Hay Haruka! I think we should threw another money making idea!&quot; 
Haruka &quot;Really? tell me, about it?&quot; Kitsune babbled about her get rich 
quick seam. The two had really come together in the last month, Shinobu 
and Su were tinkering about with something. Motoko knew it was either a 
new machine of some sort or a mecka tama.

Motoko shuttered at the thought of a big giant turtle chasing her along 
the beach. She wanted to enjoy her stay as much as possible but she 
couldn&#39;t really enjoy it with anyone but her self. She let out a light 
sigh and walked around the broken tea house picking up broken wood here 
and there.

Motoko heard Naru&#39;s voice &quot;Oh hi Mutsumi what are you doing here?&quot; 
Motoko ignored them and continued to pick up broken peace&#39;s of the tea 
house. Once she had enough wood in her hands she dropped them in to a 
pile out side the door.

Mutsumi doing something usual to her nature tripped over sand she landed 
face first in to the soft sand. Naru freaked out, &quot;Oh are you alright 
Mutsumi?&quot; &quot;Oh yeah I&#39;m alright Naru-chan.&quot; said Mutsumi, Motoko found 
her self laughing lightly at the sight of the clumsy of the girl.

Motoko went back in side to pick up some more peace&#39;s of the tea house. 
&gt;If they were going to turn this broken down place back to normal they 
should at least pick up the old one.&lt; Motoko thought to her self

She found peace&#39;s of broken glass &gt;Better pick those up before Ditz 
-o-matic nine thousand comes in here.&lt; Motoko thought to her self. As 
luck would have it Mutsumi walked in, Motoko turned around her attention 
only on the sharp peace&#39;s of glass in her hands.  Mutsumi was going to 
say hello when she tripped, smashing right in to Motoko who had the 
glass in her hands.

Motoko let out a yelp as the glass cut threw her hands, Naru ran in side 
only seeing Mutsumi on top of Motoko. Naru only started to laugh &quot;Oh 
Mutsumi you&#39;ve gata be careful.&quot; Naru pulled Mutsumi off of Motoko, she 
saw that Motoko&#39;s hands were bleeding &quot;Aw..&quot; Said Motoko in a low voice

&quot;Oh my goodness Motoko are you alright?&quot; asked Naru now realizing why 
Motoko hadn&#39;t moved. Motoko sat up she couldn&#39;t us her hands, &quot;Ah.. ssss 
stupid glass..&quot; said Motoko under her breath. Naru &quot;Here let me help you 
up.&quot; they got Motoko up from her spot.

* Some time later *

Motoko&#39;s hands were bandaged up she was better but she really couldn&#39;t 
hold anything. Naru felt stupid now she had apologized to Motoko at 
least nine million times. Motoko had just brushed it off even though she 
had to admit it did hurt a little.

Shinobu came in now with some food, Motoko felt so weird having people 
do anything for her. She was quiet independent and usually wasn&#39;t use to 
all this attack of woman who wanted nothing but to wait on her hand and 
foot now that she was hurt. &quot;Oh you look better Motoko-chan.&quot; said 
Shinobu she had made her famous sup. &quot;Thanks, I think I feel better.&quot;

Motoko looked at her hands the bandages front and back, Shinobu &quot;Would 
you like some help?&quot; &quot;hu?&quot; asked Motoko she had been thinking about the 
glass. Shinobu asked again &quot;Would you like me to help?&quot; Motoko shook her 
head &quot;Na just leave it there I&#39;ll probably eat it later.&quot;

Shinobu left hoping that Motoko would eat it, Motoko sat there in the 
silence of the room. Motoko remembered a song that entered in to her 
mind. &quot; Peace in the struggle, To find peace, Comfort on the way, To 
comfort.&quot; &quot;And if I shed a tear I won&#39;t cage it, I won&#39;t fear love, And 
if I feel a rage I won&#39;t deny it, I won&#39;t fear love, I won&#39;t fear love, 
I won&#39;t fear love...&quot; as if the song hit her heart Motoko found her self 
starting to cry.

She now wanted just to be with someone she didn&#39;t care who it was she 
just wanted the comfort. Motoko hung her head down she looked at her 
hands. Only tears slid down her face, the door opened, Motoko tried to 
clear the tears away quickly. Naru&#39;s voice &quot;Well we&#39;re holding a dance 
to night that&#39;s what the two woman of money thought of.&quot; Motoko knew 
Naru was talking about Haruka and Kitsune. Motoko tried to hid that fact 
she was crying she let her long hair hid her face.

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Motoko asked trying to steady her voice. Naru &quot;Yep.&quot; Motoko 
now steadying her voice &quot;That sounds nice.&quot; Naru &quot;You can come.. I mean 
if your feeling up to it.&quot; Motoko &quot;Yeah.. I&#39;ll come..&quot; she didn&#39;t really 
want to but right now she just didn&#39;t care as long as Naru didn&#39;t notice 
her tears.

Naru &quot;Well see you later kay?&quot; Motoko &quot;See ya.&quot; the door closed Motoko 
was along again. She got out of the bed her hands still hurt a little 
but not as much as they had been.

* The Dance *

Motoko had gotten ready she was in a pair of blue jeans and a normal 
shirt. Motoko had found the gang easily due to the fact that there were 
was one guy surrounded by six woman. Which brought them out of the rest 
of the crowd. Motoko joined them in the circle she felt better but only 
a little. The woman all danced in a circle but Naru was casing after 
Keitaro again.

Motoko didn&#39;t care she wanted to enjoy this dance even if her hands 
bothered her a bit. Mutsumi was next to her &quot;Hay.. how are you?&quot; she 
asked Motoko looked at her &quot;Fine could be better.&quot; she stated Mutsumi 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry about earlier. I didn&#39;t mean to hurt you.&quot; Motoko just smiled 
Mutsumi was quite fun to watch she was shorter then Motoko her self. But 
Mutsumi seamed to care about the odd things that she did. Motoko &quot;That&#39;s 
alright I&#39;ll get over it.&quot; she said.

Mutsumi continued to dance next to her. &quot;Hay lets give them a show.&quot; 
Motoko &quot;Wha?&quot; Mutsumi took Motoko by the wrist. the two of them were in 
the circle of woman Mutsumi started to dance with Motoko who had no idea 
what to do except copy her. Motoko looked at some of the people around 
her. Realization hit, the pair were not just dancing they were freak 
dancing together.

Motoko was going to escape but Mutsumi leaned all her weight against 
Motoko&#39;s chest. Motoko looked forward she was met with Mutsumi&#39;s head, 
&gt;Screw it!&lt; Thought Motoko.

The two continued to dance making odd gestures to each other as if they 
were a loving couple. Motoko let Mutsumi take the lead every now and 
again but Motoko could easily take it back from her.

The two reached a new love for one another, Mutsumi spun around she gave 
Motoko a hug. &quot;I love you, my female lover.&quot; she said, Motoko turned red 
&quot;Oi.&quot; Mutsumi laughed.

End
