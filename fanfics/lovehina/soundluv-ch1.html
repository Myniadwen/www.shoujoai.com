<pre>Sounds like love to me.

Motoko hestitantly entered the teahouse. Haruka looked up from What she
was doing (which was, to be honest, not a lot). It was unusual for
Motoko to come to the teahouse, especially at this time of the
afternoon, when she was usually either training or studying.

&quot;Hello Motoko. What brings you here?&quot; Haruka asked politely.

Motoko sits quietly for a while, and Haruka notices a slight red tinge
on the girls usually rather pale complexion. After a minute or two,
Motoko hestitantly speaks:

&quot;I... I need to talk to you.&quot; She says.

&quot;Oh, is that so? What is it you want to talk about then?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Motoko&#39;s face grows redder, &quot;I think I love someone...&quot;

&quot;You &#39;think&#39; you love someone?&quot;

&quot;Well, whenever I look at the person my heart beats faster, and I can&#39;t
help blushing... And whenever that person smiles at me, I feel weak at
the knees... But it can&#39;t be love!&quot;

Haruka shrugs. &quot;sounds like love to me.&quot;

&quot;But... But... That person is a woman!&quot; Motoko exclaimed, expecting
Haruka to be shocked, or maybe disgusted.

Haruka, however, merely raised an eyebrow and looked at her for a while.
&quot;Well, that explains why you&#39;re so worked up about this. But really, I
don&#39;t think it&#39;s such a big deal. If you love someone, you love someone.
And that&#39;s that.&quot; Haruka calmly takes a drag on her cigarette. &quot;So, who
is this other girl? Someone here in Hinatasou?&quot;

Motoko nods slowly.

&quot;kitsune?&quot;

This time however, Motoko shakes her head.

&quot;Who, then?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s... It&#39;s...&quot; Motoko looks down into the table and blushes redder
than ever. &quot;It&#39;s you, Haruka.&quot;

Haruka opens her eyes wide and draws breath quickly upon hearing this,
and, as you probably understand, you shouldn&#39;t draw breath to quickly
with a cigarette hanging losely in your mouth. As the cigarette got
stuck in her throat and she started to choke, Motoko hurried over to her
and performed the Heimlich manuever.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Haruka said, still wheesing.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;

A moment of silence passed.

&quot;Soo... Are you going to let go of me?&quot; Haruka said, looking down on
Motoko&#39;s arms that still held her tight.

&quot;Do... Do I have to?&quot;

Haruka contemplated for a moment, trying to find what she really felt
for the girl embracing her.

&quot;No, not really.&quot; She said, and then turned around withouth breaking
Motoko&#39;s grip and kissed the younger girl directly on the mouth. Motoko
was shocked at first, but then she relaxed and started to move into the
kiss herself. Harukas mouth tasted slightly of ash and tobacco, but that
merely became another facet of the blissful experience that washed
through Motoko&#39;s mind as she let her tounge explore the inside of her
newly found beloved&#39;s mouth.

When they finally broke off the kiss, Haruka looked Motoko deeply in the
eyes and said: &quot;I honestly don&#39;t know whether I love you or not, but I&#39;m
prepared to find out.&quot;

&quot;Find out? How?&quot; Motoko sounded a bit nervous.

Haruka smiled a smile which, if not actually evil, was at least very,
very naughty. &quot;How do you think?&quot;

------------------------------------------------------

The following evening, Motoko was standing outside the door to Haruka&#39;s
room. She was wearing the dress she had worn when everyone in Hinatasou
went turtle-hunting, and feeling the thight, clingy fabric on er skin
wasn&#39;t making her any less nervous. She hestitantly raised her hand and
knocked on the door...

&quot;Come in.&quot; She heard Haruka say from inside.

She opened the door and gasped at what she saw. The room was brightly
lit by dozens of candles situated in each corner of ther room. They
where placed in stone throughs with a few centimeters of water in them,
which both made sure that the candles would go out once they&#39;ve burned
down to far, and reflected the candlelight, giving it a shimmering tint.
Haruka was sitting on the futon wearing a skimpy, see-through negligee
and black lace panties and bra underneath. The flowing, warm light of
the candles made her look nothing short of divine.

&quot;Come here, Motoko.&quot; Haruka said with a gesture towards herself.

Motoko slowly walked towards Haruka, Who then stood up and ran her hands
across her lover&#39;s back.

&quot;That dress used to be mine, you know.&quot; Haruka whispered. &quot;It looks good
on you. But... You&#39;d look even better without it.&quot;

Motoko blushes brightly and Started taking off the dress. As it came
off, Haruka gave off a little surprised sound. Motoko was not wearing
any underwear...

Seing that her lover was fazed for a moment, Motoko quickly pulled the
negligee of off Haruka and trew it onto the floor. She then gaught her
in a tight embrace and kissed her passionately. She could feel her naked
breasts pressing against the lacy fabric of Haruka&#39;s Bra, and felt her
nipples stiffen from the contact.

Haruka regained her balance and bore down on Motoko, landing on top as
they both fell onto the foton, their lips never once breaking contact.
Haruka broke of the kiss and smiled slyly. She started moving up and
down, making sure her lingerie rubbed against Motoko&#39;s most sensitive
parts.

Motoko yelped and reflexively rolled over, ending up on top of the older
woman. Without a word, she started undoing Harukas bra. As it came of,
she looked in awe at her lovers body. Though Haruka was noticeably older
than she, there where no wrinkles to be seen anywhere, and the
candlelight gave her skin the warm, amber colour of wild honey. Motoko
felt ancient urges and instincts take over, and let her lips encircle
Haruka&#39;s left nipple, sucking on it and flicking it hither and dither
with her tounge.

Haruka let out a low moan as she felt the stimuli her lover was giving
her, and let her fingers run through the other girls long black hair.
She gently nudged the top of Motoko&#39;s head, and the younger girl
interpreted the gesture correctly, letting her tounge trail along
Haruka&#39;s body as she moved her head further down. Motoko placed her
mouth over the older womans genitals, and Haruka moaned with pleasure as
she felt her lovers saliva mix with her own juices through the fabric of
her panties.

Motoko withdrew her head and removed her lovers underwear. She then
gazed upon Haruka&#39;s glistening, wet womanhood and wetted her lips. As
she let her tounge run across her lover&#39;s slit, savouring the taste of
the juices flowing from it, she felt an arrousal unrivaled by anything
she&#39;d ever known before. She looked upon Haruka&#39;s clit, which was bright
and swollen from arousal, and smiled as she  moved her lips over to it.

Haruka moaned loudly as her lovers lips closed on her pleasure nub, and
felt something like an electric shock shooting through her each time her
lover&#39;s lips made contact. Her moans got louder and louder and she
knew she wasn&#39;t far from orgasm. Then she felt her lover&#39;s teeth gently
touch her most precious spot, and was hit by a solid wall of pure bliss.
She was vaguely aware of her lover giving her a kiss on the lips as the
aftermath of the orgasm had her writhing in pleasure. Once it passed,
she tiredly looked up at her new lover. She had wanted to give Motoko
the same pleasure she had just been given herself, but the day had been
long and the night intense. *Well enough.* she though *After all,
there&#39;ll be other nights.*

&quot;Motoko?&quot; she said drowsily.

&quot;Yes, Haruka?&quot;

&quot;I love you.&quot;

Motoko wathced her love fall asleep, and then snuggled in close to her.
As the candles winked out, one by one, Motoko lay there and enjoyed her
lovers warmth, feeling a contentment she had never ever known before.
Slowly, with a loving smile on her face, she fell asleep.
