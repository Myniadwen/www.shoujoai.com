<pre>Reminisce

Kanako stepped into the small Maehara caf&eacute;, which seemed like a small 
scale jazz club to her. There was a small stage where a band could 
play; the lights were just barely bright enough for a jazz club. She 
removed the white necktie around her neck completely, removing her 
black suit and placing it on the coat hanger just beside the doors 
that opened outwards, a precaution in case of fire. She almost 
perfectly blended in with the area surrounding her, with her entirely 
black attire. As if to reminisce about old times, she pulled out a 
long, red lace from her pocket and tied her hair back the way she used 
to, with two long protrusions just in front of her ears and one single 
strand sticking out like a horn. She and Shinobu sat down by the small 
bar, which almost seemed out of place. Miho smiled as she walked past 
them, taking Shinji with her to the upstairs, where their living 
quarters were.

&#147;What&#146;ll it be boss?&#148; the young brunette asked as she approached 
Shinobu.

&#147;I&#146;ll just have the usual, thank you.&#148; Shinobu smiled as she faced 
Kanako.

Kanako couldn&#146;t help but look beautiful in the dim light of the caf&eacute;, 
in the way that some women look impossibly beautiful in the right 
light Kanako looked impossibly beautiful in the right lack of light. 
It wasn&#146;t because she was ugly or unsightly but rather because the 
darkness served to enhance the innate elegance of her face, her modest 
figure and that cunning smile that never ceased to make anyone who saw 
it twitch. Shinobu had always noticed that peculiar trait of Kanako&#146;s, 
darkness seemed to mold itself to serve her will, to take away the 
imperfections and leave only what Kanako wanted everyone to see. As 
the girl arrived with a large mocha latte, Shinobu directed the girl&#146;s 
attention to Kanako, who didn&#146;t really seem to be concentrating on 
anything in particular. Shinobu had become used to seeing that side of 
Kanako more than anyone else, the contemplative, serene and almost 
artistic side of her. Whenever Kanako would be in such a mood, Shinobu 
had to bring a tray of food up to her room, where she would observe 
for a while before leaving the shadowy one alone.

&#147;What&#146;ll it be, miss?&#148; the girl asked with a bright cheeriness.

&#147;A cup of coffee would be nice. Black, preferably.&#148; Kanako answered 
with her eyes on Shinobu.

To Kanako, Shinobu was still that cute, innocent girl that she had 
encountered so long ago. She still had those blue eyes that could 
almost melt the ice of Kanako&#146;s stoic heart. Kanako never really had 
any special feelings for the girl; she initially treated her as a 
stranger until Shinobu made the first step to breach the gap. It was 
that doll of made in her image, a doll that Kanako still had, that was 
the first of many stepping stones to bridging the gap between them. 
The figure was certainly far, far more attractive now, far beyond 
anything Kanako&#146;s development. Those long talks they shared on those 
rare moments alone that they found themselves in were precious to 
Kanako, who would have traded them for nothing. Shinobu helped her get 
through losing Keitaro, helped her find the strength to move on. Aside 
from that, and probably more importantly, Shinobu was the only one 
aside from Keitaro to treat her as a person. In the long run, that may 
prove to be even more valuable.

&#147;We were so different from one another.&#148; Shinobu broke their silence 
as Kanako stared into her coffee. Even after all these years, she was 
surprised to find that they still felt awkward around one another 
during moments like this: moments when true, emotional bonding was 
possible. &#147;We had nothing in common and you didn&#146;t really want any 
friends.&#148;

&#147;I remember.&#148; Kanako smiled at the memory before taking a sip of her 
coffee. &#147;Do you remember what Motoko-san said when she found out we 
went to a karaoke bar together? We went with Kitsune, at that.&#148;

&#147;I remember it perfectly. She said that &#145;you should avoid being around 
Kanako-san. She is a despicable and dishonorable person. She is an 
even more corrupting influence than her brother.&#146; Yes, that&#146;s what she 
said.&#148; Shinobu&#146;s smile seemed to wane a little, which Kanako didn&#146;t 
really pick up on.

&#147;She was right you know.&#148; Kanako nodded her head as she looked on at 
nothing once more. Once, the admittance of anything other than 
unconditional and hopelessly devoted love for Keitaro was considered a 
taboo for her. Now, years in the yakuza have made her develop a hint 
of a guilty conscience. Perhaps, it may well be the reason why she 
betrayed the Kamakura. &#147;I&#146;m not really what one would call a wholesome 
friend. Some might say I don&#146;t have a kind bone in my body.&#148;

Both of them fell silent for a while, contemplating how to move their 
pieces next. Their relationship was, in the purest sense of the words, 
a chess game. At least, that was how Kanako saw it. She remembered 
what she saw in those innocent blue eyes the first time she saw her. 
It wasn&#146;t the little angel that everyone else had seen; it was 
something different since Kanako always saw things differently. It was 
a reflection of her from many years ago. Her parents had abandoned her 
and she knew that was how Shinobu must have felt when her parents 
divorced: abandoned. Kanako managed to view it all in the blink of an 
eye, how the girl could easily have stepped and fallen into the same 
downward spiral that she did so long ago. However, the girl before her 
know was different from her in every aspect. No, this girl had not 
gone through the same path that Kanako did. This girl did not fall 
from grace and it made Kanako let out a sincere smile.

&#147;It&#146;s amazing, how different the two of us are despite&#133;&#148; Kanako 
stopped. Kanako was certain that her companion knew nothing of her 
past. How the courts assigned her to an orphanage since neither parent 
was capable of raising her properly alone.

&#147;How different we are despite having lived through the same situation 
as a child?&#148; Shinobu answered with a smile. She knew of Kanako&#146;s past, 
Haruka had informed her some time ago. Perhaps that knowledge was why 
she struggled so much to befriend Kanako. &#147;Haruka-san told me about 
what happened. The divorce, the court&#146;s decisions, how you were 
adopted, everything.&#148;

&#147;So you know.&#148; Kanako lowered her head and removed her rectangular 
framed glasses and put them on the bar. &#147;Then, you must have 
understood that, in some way, had you not met me, you might have 
easily become me.&#148;

&#147;Yes, I do&#148; Shinobu bowed her head as well but turned her head to look 
at Kanako&#146;s downtrodden expression. &#147;I know how it feels.&#148;

Shinobu closed her eyes. Not a day passed by in those early years 
after moving to Hinata Sou without her thinking of taking some measure 
of revenge. For many years, she could feel the bitterness, the anger, 
the hurt of betrayal that was deep in her heart. Not even Keitaro, or 
anyone else for that matter, could have removed that. They helped he 
through it, overcome it but as the days passed and Keitaro&#146;s attention 
was slowly directed to Naru more than her, she could feel it again. 
Slowly rising, like a coiled viper, it was ready to strike again and 
it threatened to devour her. In a sense, she felt Keitaro had betrayed 
her. She would never have admitted it though, the fact that her 
conscience was just a few days from slipping into the void. She could 
hide it from everyone else but she could not hide from her own 
thoughts and dreams. The thought of poisoning Naru&#146;s food had occurred 
to her in a dream at least once. Then, when Haruka told her Kanako&#146;s 
story, she saw jus what she could become if she had allowed her darker 
thoughts to take shape.

&#147;A life dictated by bitterness, misplaced passions, hatred and the 
fear of being betrayed that drives one into isolation.&#148; Kanako said to 
no one in particular. Or was she saying it to Shinobu? It really 
wasn&#146;t possible to tell. &#147;People like me don&#146;t really change. We only 
become more what we were from the start.&#148;

&#147;No, I don&#146;t believe that, Kanako-san.&#148; Shinobu said with some alarm 
in her voice. Kanako smiled inwardly, if the girl was trying to save 
her, she was many years too late. &#147;It&#146;s true; we can&#146;t change what we 
are. But, I believe, what I do think we can change is&#133;what we become.&#148;

&#147;I never would have thought you the philosophical type.&#148; Kanako said 
as she lifted the cup to her pale lips. In that light, she looked more 
like what she was years ago, before she had completely given up on 
herself, when a human heart still beat inside her, as she once put it. 
&#147;I guess I underestimated you.&#148;</pre>
