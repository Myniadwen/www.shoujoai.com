<h1>Perfect Hands</h1>

<pre>Ah, nothing like the wonderful sounds of metal clanging against metal. 
At least, that is what I would love to be hearing right about now.

But no, sadly for me, the Elric brothers are still in Central. You would 
think they could find some time to drop by for a tune-up, especially Ed.

Nothing like seeing my favorite customer that always brings a smile to 
my face.

Except if he comes back home with damaged automail...

I&#39;ve been working on forging my structural and casing pieces for 
automail during the long hours of the day. With my grandmother out 
shopping and taking Den with her, I was pretty much alone.

Not that it bothers me too much, it was nice to have some peace and 
quiet every once in a while. I shouldn&#39;t be complaining.

&quot;Whew...&quot;

I pause, gently settling down my tools, and standing up straight to 
stretch out, I wipe beads of cold sweat off my forehead.

&quot;I&#39;m soaked. Time for a shower!&quot;

Once I quickly disrobe and step into the shower, I let out a gentle sigh 
as the hot shower hits me as if I was in the rain. It was heaven. I 
close my eyes, relaxing, and slowly opening them, I smile Until I notice 
a slight change in my right arm.

Settling down the soap, I place my left hand over my right shoulder, 
gently rolling it. Then letting my fingertips brush down against my 
skin......

&quot;Wow, I&#39;m getting tough. Didn&#39;t know I was *this* muscular. Guess being 
a mechanic has its perks. I wonder if I should start training...&quot;

I chuckle and peer down at my breasts.

&quot;These are getting bigger, too. But all they&#39;ve been good for is getting 
in the way...&quot;

Slowly moving my hands up, I cup them, and give them a gentle squeeze.

I let out a soft moan.

&quot;Mmmm.........Riza...&quot;

Then I blink. &quot;What the hell...?&quot;

Ed! I meant to say Ed&#39;s name! Where did Riza&#39;s name come from?

Yet the more I try to keep the little alchemist in my thoughts, the more 
the elder blonde gunslinger keeps coming back! What was going on?

Before I realized what was going through my mind right now, I gasp and 
grunt out a sudden moan. Leaning against the shower wall, I look down, 
feeling my face burning up. My hand had somehow moved on its own, and is 
now within the depths of my sacred garden. Rubbing at the inner walls, 
it sends a wave of sharp pleasure shivering up my spine.

&quot;Oooooooh, yeah, Riza....faster...&quot;

My mind starts to race as I rub at my clit even faster, crouching down 
in the process. My breathing grows ragged as I get closer and closer to 
reaching my climax.

&quot;Ahhhh........come on.......that&#39;s the spot right there...&quot;

I slowly lose myself in my fierce moans, this time moving down my other 
hand to press my fingers even deeper within the inner folds. But not 
close to penetration. Heavens, no. For......well........for the fact 
that I am still a virgin. Nothing to be ashamed of, of course....

Shivering in sheer pleasure, I moan, rubbing that sensitive area between 
my legs, which respond in a very positive manner. I&#39;m getting too 
sensitive.

I stop to consider why my thoughts went back to Riza from Ed.

She was always such a strong female figure, someone I would totally be 
looking up to. And the fact that there are not that many female members 
in the state military, it makes me feel proud to have made the 
acquintance of the lieutenant. Not an alchemist, but she makes up for by 
her excellent skills with firearms.

But why think of her on a far more intimate level...? Speaking of hands, 
she was always skilled with her own, but it was not just with the use of 
firearms....in knowing how to, can we say, &#39;satisfy&#39;?

Well, thinking back, we pretty much *did* have intimate moments. The 
rarest of times when I went to visit the brothers in Central, it was a 
pain choosing between staying at a military hotel or at a cheaper one in 
town.

And I couldn&#39;t impose on the Hughes family after.......well, imagine the 
surprised look on my face when Riza had offered her own place.

And I accepted.

Being the kind guest that I was, and being the kind host that she was, I 
could not take her bed, and she would not have me sleep on the floor. 
Well, all things considered, I gave in. Her bed was big enough for two 
people.


One thing led to another. Riza made sure that my stay was very 
satisfying. I can&#39;t say she&#39;s a bad kisser, either. The night got so hot 
that I just had to disrobe and let her mature body touch mine. Bad 
enough she took it upon herself to disrobe right there in front of me. I 
had to ask where she got such hot lingerie from.

Just listening to her warm seductive whispers in my ear got me wet, 
feeling her hands rubbing my breasts, my stomach, her soft kisses on my 
neck, nibbling on like a cat, licking down my shoulder, we barely said a 
word to each other.

Well, it&#39;s hard to talk when your mouth is busy occupying someone else&#39;s 
bare breasts. As for me, I was too busy moaning and making other types 
of intimate noises, other than begging her not to stop.

And feeling her fingers so close to my sacred flower, I actually thought 
she was going to break me.

But no.

She wouldn&#39;t knowing I wasn&#39;t ready for it, that my first time just 
hadn&#39;t arrived. I told her this. She smiled, and kissed me softly on the 
lips, wishing me luck with the young alchemist. I almost didn&#39;t want to 
leave her bed.

Advice on how to get Ed&#39;s attention, or simply teasing, inviting me to 
touch her where I would never have dreamt I could be doing with a 
military officer. She sure behaves differently when not being at work, 
and that&#39;s only the tip of the iceberg.

Remembering how soft and firm her breasts were.....as long as she 
welcomed it......as long as she was inviting me to feel her incredible 
body......mmmm......I was one happy guest. She was gentle, too. Riza 
really knew how to accommodate.

And having her seeing me off as I hopped on the train back to Resembool, 
it was one night I would never forget.

I don&#39;t mean to brag, but I had always been good with my hands. Each and 
every one of my customers have told me the same thing. And such talented 
hands should not go to waste. Is it a wonder that they haven&#39;t been 
suffering so much givin my hectic work schedule, yet they still feel 
soft?

I just never knew they were good at something like *this*, for exploring 
my body. All I had ever done with my hands was working.

I am happy with my body, happy that I can give myself pleasure like 
this. Consider it my own little reward for when I&#39;m alone and no one 
else is with me.

But sometimes it would be nice, the more I think about it, if I can give 
someone *else* good pleasure.

Riza changed all that. I should think of a way of returning the favor 
the next time I stay over...

A sharp cry escapes my throat, and I slump down, pressing my back 
against the shower wall as I continue working at it, inserting my 
fingers in and out, in and out, with each slide, my fingers get more and 
more covered in my own juices, and having the imagery of doing this to 
Riza.

But would she even allow me to finger her clit? She is the dominant one, 
I could not think of being the one on top. Unless she liked playing it 
rough, I could always bring along some of my tools and a pair of 
handcuffs that I was mostly saving for Ed.

I notice my nipples have hardened.

I look down at my fingers, covered in my sticky juices, then I take a 
gentle lick. Mmmmm...I&#39;ve always wondered how I tasted. Now I&#39;m not even 
sure how to describe it.

Glancing up to the shower head, just watching as the water rains down on 
me...

I stand up and reach out to pull it off from the bracket and I crouch 
back down, and holding my breath, gripping it tightly in my hand, 
hearing the water running, I shut my eyes and bring it down to my 
flower....

And I scream so hard that if anyone else was in the shop, they could 
easily hear me.

The pleasure is incredible. So much more than if I was using my own 
hands! Sweet heavens, does it feel good! But it was quickly over.

As I slump down on my knees, relaxing in a state of post-orgasmic bliss, 
I know that if she wanted more pleasure, I could use my hands anytime, 
especially in bed.

Granny wouldn&#39;t appreciate finding wet sheets the next day, though.

&quot;Winry? You home? We&#39;re back!&quot;

Crap!

&quot;Welcome back, Granny! I was just getting out of the shower!&quot;

Great. How am I going to explain this love bite on my neck to her? Thank 
the gods for coveralls, but who knows how long that will last? </pre>
