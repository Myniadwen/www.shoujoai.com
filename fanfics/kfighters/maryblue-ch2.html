<a href="../kfighters/maryblue-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Andy you&#39;re home!&quot; Mai greeted her favorite guy. She felt that secure 
tingling feeling that was around whenever she was close to him. She 
didn&#39;t know what it came from but she wanted it. 

&quot;How did it go? Did my favorite hunk win the trophy this time?&quot; She 
asked with anticipation in her eyes. Andy looked away. 

&quot;I... I... lost...&quot; Mai sighed as she heard this. Was Andy never to be
happy with a tournament? 

&quot;Next time! Next time Terry I will beat you!&quot; Andy nearly shouted. &quot;I 
will train more, I will become stronger!&quot; He pulled Mai with him and 
went off towards the kunoichi&#39;s training grounds. 

&quot;Hey you can&#39;t go there! The girls are training and...&quot; 

&quot;You can spar with me!&quot; He said abruptly. That strange feeling returned 
to Mai again. She could try one more time. 

&quot;Will you be happy then?&quot; She asked hoping that this would be something 
he would appreciate her for. 

&quot;YES!&quot; Andy said impatiently. 

&quot;O-Okay... I&#39;ll see what I can do...&quot; Mai said carefully. 

&quot;Good!&quot; Andy said and hurried even more. 

*** 

Mary&#39;s apartment at 7:00 AM, Sunday. 

&quot;Sooo, you want to take the next step in our relationship?&quot; She asked 
with a somewhat weird tone. 

&quot;Yesssss...&quot; Dark Mai replied eagerly. She licked her lips and carefully
tasted Mary&#39;s cheek. 

&quot;He, he... Okay I&#39;ll begin.&quot; Mary said and stroked the cheek of the 
excited clone with her soft fingers. &quot;I... love... you! Now you say it. 
Okay?&quot; 

&quot;WHAT???&quot; Dark Mai thought. 

&quot;I... I...&quot; She tried.&quot; The mimic was confused. &quot;What is this? What is
this she is trying to do to me.&quot; The mimic&#39;s mind seemed to twist around
itself and scream as its spine cracked. 

&quot;This... this love thing again... why does she want me to say it... of
... of course I love her... nani?&quot; The mimic&#39;s mouth opened and closed
several times without more words than slight hisses and sighs coming out
of it. 

&quot;Mai c&#39;mon... I told you right?&quot; Dark Mai gasped as she felt Mary
bringing the kunoichi&#39;s finger&#39;s to her lips and then tasting her index
finger carefully. This was a good motivation but... 

&quot;I can&#39;t... I couldn&#39;t... I...&quot; Dark Mai&#39;s emotions conflicted with her 
instincts. This was wrong... it felt right... wrong... right... she
wanted energy... Mary was her first real prey... she wanted more... she
wanted it all... and still... 

&quot;Get off me! I can&#39;t do this!&quot; Dark Mai cried and slapped the shocked 
bounty hunter. As Mary tried asking what was wrong she was pushed off 
the bed by the suddenly furious clone. 

&quot;Leave me alone, why are you doing this!? I don&#39;t want...&quot; 

&quot;So it is true... you would never... *sniff*... leave him... even though
I care about you more than he could ever wish for...&quot; Mary said from her
uncomfortable position. In an instant her dreams were gone and reality 
had ran over her like a rampaging train. &quot;I thought...&quot; 

Dark Mai grabbed her wrist and gave her a look filled with anger and 
hate. &quot;SHUT UP! SHUT UP! You don&#39;t understand!!!&quot; The clone screamed 
&quot;You can&#39;t just... just...&quot; 

Dark Mai wanted to protest... she wanted to whack some sense into the 
silly girl...she wanted to be what she was... she wanted this freedom...
she wanted to... she wanted... Mary... 

&quot;Oh my... what am I doing!? What am I doing... oh god... poor Mary...&quot;
She thought in a sudden realization. Dark Mai released Mary&#39;s wrist and
stroked Mary&#39;s forehead instead. Terrified for reasons she couldn&#39;t 
understand she began patting the crying bounty hunter&#39;s hair. 

&quot;I... &quot; She shook her head. &quot;...of course Mary! A-are you okay...? You
... you are right... right?&quot; Mary shivered but said nothing. This made
Dark Mai worry. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry... so sorry... onegai... please... please... please talk to
me... I didn&#39;t mean to...&quot; Without thinking she waved her hand to break
off any energy flowing between them. She turned away from the weeping
bounty hunter and sighed deeply... this was bad... what about her plan
now... 

&quot;M-Mai...?&quot; She heard the blonde saying. &quot;I... I... forgive you... I...
can&#39;t... help... I love you... I can&#39;t help you love... HIM... I&#39;m
sorry... I know... I know about Andy... you must feel... horrible...&quot;
Dark Mai&#39;s eyes widened. 

&quot;NO! DON&#39;T BE SORRY! It&#39;s my fault!&quot; Dark Mai pleaded &quot;You should hit 
me!&quot; She stood up and spread her arms. 

&quot;C&#39;mon, take your best shot! I deserve it!&quot; The mimic said while waving 
towards herself with her hands. 

Mary didn&#39;t understand what Mai was trying to prove. She could 
understand if the kunoichi was stressed. She was still fighting whether 
she should be with Andy or not... She must be out of her head. It was so
sad... and of course she couldn&#39;t hurt Mai, I would be idiotic... and so
pointless. 

&quot;Mai... promise that you won&#39;t hurt me again... then it&#39;s okay...&quot; Dark 
Mai&#39;s heart was stung by this. She gasped and felt a strange sensation
through her body. 

&quot;Oh... oh... OF COURSE!!! I promise! If I EVER talk to you like that or
lay hand on you I will hurl myself through a skyscraper window! Now
punish me, c&#39;mon it&#39;ll make it feel better, hurt me like I hurt you...&quot;
She felt yet another sensation. Something in her face. A hot fluid drip
running down her cheek. She noticed Mary&#39;s unwillingness to dish out
some punishment and it tormented her. 

&quot;*sob*... please... come on Mary... do it... Mary... I... love...
you...&quot; Mary gasped, she said it! She hugged the mimic and showered her
with sweet and soft kisses. She used her lips to dry the mimic&#39;s cheeks
clean from tears. 

Dark Mai pulled Mary&#39;s face away from her and tried to make words of 
what she was feeling. They had been up all morning making sweet, sweet 
love to each other. She didn&#39;t have words for it. She couldn&#39;t 
understand it. She had hurt Mary, and still she was here... kissing
her... so sweetly...What was this in her eyes... what was this...
burning sensation in her chest... 

&quot;Mary?&quot; 

&quot;Yes...&quot; 

&quot;I... I... still want you...&quot; Mary lay her head against Dark Mai&#39;s
shoulder and hugged her tightly. The mimic hugged back and tried to
wipe her tears away. She was so happy and couldn&#39;t stop them from
running. She stroked her hand through Mary&#39;s hair and relaxed as she
leaned her head against her lover&#39;s shoulder. 

&quot;I never want to leave you...&quot; 

*** 

Mai&#39;s training grounds. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Yuri... you will have to get the exam another day... Andy is
here and...&quot; 

&quot;I understand.&quot; Yuri said. She smiled and managed well in hiding her 
disappointment. She would&#39;ve taken her exam in Mai&#39;s &quot;Independent 
fighting course&quot; today. She understood Mai, she was in love with Andy 
and of course this was her training ground. Yuri still hated Andy 
though, she didn&#39;t really know why but she did. Every time she saw him 
there was some sort of disappointment luring in the air and she always 
came to think of how much better Ryo and especially Ryo was in fighting.
When would he realize that he maybe wasn&#39;t cut out to be a true fighter?

&quot;Ibuki hasn&#39;t come back yet?&quot; Yuri blinked as her thoughts were 
disrupted. 

&quot;Ibuki? She came in this morning... seemed very excited, I think she&#39;s  
in her room now, should I get her to leave as well?&quot; 

&quot;No! I gave her that room. Go on and I&#39;ll talk to her later. Oh, where&#39;s
Eiji?&quot; Yuri shook her head. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know really. He said he was meeting someone... ahm... Kasumi?&quot;
She replied. Mai knew the name. 

&quot;Of course! I had forgotten! Well, if you&#39;ll excuse us, Andy and I are 
gonna... Andy?&quot; Andy (Agh! 3 times in one line, I will be punished for 
this! I&#39;m not worthy!!!) had already entered the grounds and was 
training with a sparring doll. 

&quot;Oh, well, I&#39;ll be seeing you then! Bye!&quot; Mai said and entered the 
grounds. Yuri kicked some rocks away and grumbled as she was on her way 
home. Maybe she could convince Robert to give her a private lesson to 
let off some steam. 

&quot;Okay beautiful, show me some moves!&quot; Mai as she confronted Andy. The 
karateka smiled and he got into his triangular stance. 

*** 

Several hours later, Mary&#39;s apartment. 

Dark Mai sighed. Mary was lying silently beside her. She wondered where 
the real Mai could be and what would happen if she saw this. It wasn&#39;t 
important and after tomorrow none of that would matter, but the mimic 
was still curious. 

What had they been doing? They had cuddled up next to each other in 
front of a machine called television. Of course Dark Mai knew what it 
was, just as with the mobile phone, but she had never seen one for 
herself. They had watched some sitcom and the mimic had wrapped herself 
around Mary and swept a quilt around them. She enjoyed feel the bounty 
hunters back against her chest. It was so nice. 

Then they had watched a Jackie Chan action movie, which Dark Mai had 
found particularly interesting since it was about martial arts. Mary had
gotten some food for them and even though Dark Mai didn&#39;t feel the taste
she felt great delight in them feeding each other. 

&quot;MY Mary!&quot; 

Dark Mai was still feeling that something in her. She felt like she 
could take on the world for the woman in front of her. She felt like she
would do anything that Mary could possibly ask for just to make the girl
smile. Dark Mai wouldn&#39;t be able to live without the bounty hunter and 
no one that took her away would live for long. 

The mimic turned to her side and looked at the sleeping bounty hunter. 
She could see her chest rising and sinking. Sure Mai liked the bounty 
hunter, very much. But there was a big difference between them. For Dark
Mai, Mary was now the only person she would settle with. The only person
in the world that would do. Even if she &quot;turned off&quot; the mimicked part 
of her mind, the bounty was still the only thing she could think of, it 
was real. 

Mai seemed to be settled for Andy, but when the mimic really thought 
about it, it seemed like there were many others of all types and that 
she had never been really satisfied with any of them. Mai was certainly 
not a loose person, she just hadn&#39;t found the right one for her. The 
mimic was certain that Leona was. She was after all, the one behind Mary
in Mai&#39;s &quot;caring&quot; list. And the mimic couldn&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t let go of 
Mary now! So either Mai had to settle with Andy or Leona. 

The mimic once again aimed her attention to the sleeping bounty hunter. 
She looked so peaceful when sleeping. Her eyes closed, so protected and 
happily unaware of all the terrible things going on in this world, or 
another. The mimic enjoyed the peaceful face of the blond woman lying 
beside her. She wanted to make sure that she would remember this 
expression, forever. Dark Mai sighed and decided to get some sleep, she
didn&#39;t need it but she wanted to try it; sleeping close and in the same 
bed as her lovers.... 

&quot;G&#39;nite my beloved!&quot; She said sleepily and placed a blanket over them. 

*** 

Meanwhile, Mai&#39;s training grounds. 

Mai stood alone at her grounds. What had she done wrong? Why could she 
never get this right!? Why did Andy always leave her like this? When 
their training had gone to its best she had &quot;accidentally&quot; tripped over 
Andy and once on top of him she had tried to get things more 
interesting. As she did however she noticed that incredible 
unwillingness again. Why was he always like that? Even now when he was 
high from the rush of the battle he was still cold and refused to accept
any of her treatments. 

Mai sighed deeply. Had she been wrong all this time? 

She suddenly noticed a shadow behind her. 

&quot;I did it, I did it, I did it! Mai, I really beat him!&quot; It was Ibuki. 
She was waving her arms and jumping from anxiety. Mai figured Ibuki had 
succeeded in her little &quot;mission&quot;. 

&quot;That&#39;s great, did you get it?&quot; Mai asked. She hid her emotions well 
enough it seemed. Ibuki held the white headband up and smiled widely. 

&quot;Oh Yes! I can&#39;t wait until tomorrow! Mmmm! Sakura, Sakura, Sakura!&quot; 
Ibuki hugged herself while she repeated the name over and over again. 
Mai could see her licking her lips in anticipation. 

&quot;Mai-san. I am so happy! Weeehhh! I don&#39;t know what to do!&quot; Ibuki spun 
around of happiness stretching her arms out. Her obvious joy was 
spreading through the air and Mai couldn&#39;t help getting affected by it. 

&quot;I am so glad for your sake, and if you have some time over, maybe you 
could spar with me, hmm?&quot; Mai said as she was all warmed up but lacked a
sparring partner. 

&quot;Anytime Mai-san!&quot; Ibuki took a stance resembling Dan&#39;s and Mai couldn&#39;t
help laughing. 

*** 

Desert Flower Hotel, 9:00 PM. 

Leona wasn&#39;t happy. She had to wait. Wait for Iori to come to her 
apartment. It would be long before he got there. She lay on her bead 
reading an arms magazine while listening to Iori&#39;s latest CD. It wasn&#39;t 
really her style of music really but it reminded her of many wonderful 
things. Unconsciously she bent her legs back and forth with an irregular
pace. 

In the shadows Dark Mai was lurking. She yawned deeply and kneaded her 
eyes. This was something that had to be done. Dark Mai had perfected her
plan, she just had to tie up some loose ends. By widening her mind she 
traced Leona&#39;s ki. It was an advanced maneuver but it was worth a try. 
Dark Mai could risk this since she was absolutely sparkling with energy.
Her quality time with Mary had done only good to her. She found the 
thread that was streaming from Leona. She touched it and and bound it to
her own. This way she would be in control of Leona&#39;s immense Ki. 

Leona moaned slightly in delight as she suddenly felt something exotic 
through her veins. It felt really strange and yet very good. 

Dark Mai thought that this should be enough. She smiled widely and took 
a final glance at the military woman&#39;s moving hips. Suddenly she was 
reminded of her own needs and couldn&#39;t resist jumping down to the floor 
for a better look. She could see the tight shorts of the military woman 
shaping around her well-toned hips. With every movement of her legs 
Leona&#39;s shorts gave her all kinds interesting views. Dark Mai was 
tempted as she came to think of a very interesting version of sex. She 
had a hard time trying not to touch Leona and give her some new 
pleasure&#39; she stretched her hand towards the military woman... she 
couldn&#39;t... something hindered her... probably the plan... Dark Mai
vanished into what looked like thin air. 

Leona felt a light breeze as she turned a page. She looked around but 
couldn&#39;t see anything. She moved her thumbs to the back of her shorts to
straighten them and then continued reading without any further 
discomfort. 

Leona had used her contacts to get a hideout and was looking for 
appropriate weapons to put in it. Her personal favorite and the only 
firearm she would ever use &quot;the all weather all purpose AK-47 of course&quot;
she thought and used a bold pen to encircle it. Maybe she should call 
Cammy to cover for her? Naa! It was only one person... Leona turned to
her back and sighed... 

&quot;Blue Mary!&quot; 

*** 

Mai&#39;s training grounds. 

(This is a part of a scene that appears in the XL version of &quot;Ibuki&#39;s 
gift&quot;, but this is from Mai&#39;s angle instead.) 

Mai was still upset with Andy just walking away from her like that. She 
was frustrated like she had never been and wanted to get back at him 
somehow. Her anger even made her think dirty thoughts such as sleeping 
with someone else. Mai was reminded of Ibuki&#39;s presence. And suddenly a 
plan was devised in her clever mind. She knew how to release som 
frustration and she was sure Ibuki wouldn&#39;t mind Mai showing her the 
ropes so to say. 

&quot;Hehehe...&quot; Mai giggled slid into her silk kimono after showering. It
was made in a dark blue color and had a dragon mark at the back. (As the
one on the floor from Geese Howard&#39;s stage from Fatal Fury Special. 
B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L!) She walked up the stairs that lead to Ibuki&#39;s room. 
She listened through the door and noticed the sound of running water. 
Mai figured she should hurry before Ibuki got into the bath. 

She opened the door and noticed Ibuki undressing. She had gotten all her
regular clothes off and was now wearing her usual black panties and bra.

&quot;Huh... Who&#39;s there!!!&quot; Ibuki took a blanket and covered as much her
body as she could. 

&quot;Relax it&#39;s only me...&quot; Mai whispered. She wasn&#39;t sure of what she was 
doing but she wanted to talk to her friend. Maybe it would bring some 
comfort, and maybe she could cure the smaller ninja from being so uneasy
amongst women. She sat down beside the smaller ninja and crossed her 
legs. The kunoichi slowly peered over the lithe body of her former 
student. 

&quot;But I...&quot; Ibuki tried to look away, but Mai grabbed her chin and looked
at her. What was it with this girl that made Mai happy whenever they 
were close? She found great comfort in just sitting there with her. 

&quot;Besides, we&#39;re both girls right?&quot; Mai said and smiled. 

&quot;R-right... but... that&#39;s... just... the problem.&quot; Ibuki tried to pull
away. Mai came to think of Ibuki saying that she was nearly exclusively
interested in other women, with only a few exceptions. 

&quot;What, why?&quot; Mai asked to bring forth a confirmation as grabbed her 
again. 

&quot;B-b... Because every time I come close to... another woman... like
you... It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t love Sakura! B-but... when I... I... I...&quot;
Ibuki&#39;s replied and didn&#39;t look too healthy. 

&quot;Shh! Are you ashamed of me being here?&quot; Mai whispered now only 
centimeters away from her face. She wanted to help her friend, and she 
also wanted some help herself. 

&quot;No no, it&#39;s not that, it&#39;s just... I-I don&#39;t know what I will do, when 
you are... you know... close... to... me... and I am not wearing any...
clothes...&quot; Ibuki was really excited and didn&#39;t want to risk doing
anything too harsh, she was looking away as much as se could. 

&quot;Do you like being here?&quot; Mai said and put a finger on the shivering 
Ibuki&#39;s chin. The kunoichi needed something. She was somewhat excited 
with the situation. 

&quot;Of course, I just... ah...&quot; She swallowed hard as Mai took her hand and
placed it inside the kimono against her chest. The kunoichi felt 
comfortable with the situation and she could see that Ibuki was too. 
However the ninja was all pale from either the pressure or excitement. 

&quot;I-I-I-I... gh gh...&quot; Now even Ibuki&#39;s voice started to shiver, she felt
so tense that Mai wondered if she was sick. The hopeful romance between 
Ibuki and Sakura came to her mind. She could use this. 

&quot;Do, you know what to do if, I mean when, you get close to Sakura?&quot; 

Just as Mai expected this seemed to relax Ibuki a little. 

&quot;N-no... eh... why?&quot; She asked. 

&quot;Well, you want to show her how much you love her?&quot; Mai asked as she 
pressed Ibuki&#39;s hand against one of her breast. Ibuki shivered once more
but managed to get enough strength back to calm her voice down a little.

&quot;Of course... b-but how do I do that...?&quot; 

&quot;I can show you how to make her feel good, and even wonderful. If that 
is what you want of course.&quot; Mai moved forward until they were so close 
that their nose-tips touched each other. The ninja&#39;s hand still 
shivered. Mai felt cold when Ibuki touched her naked breast. She wanted 
to share her heat with the nervous ninja and sat closer. Their bodies 
felt like fire against each other and Ibuki was already sweating. 

&quot;Y-Yes... I&#39;d like... that... very much.&quot; Ibuki said after a while. 

Mai noticed the small ninja&#39;s strong reactions, but she wanted to be 
easy on the younger girl. She slowly pulled Ibuki&#39;s head to her shoulder
and carefully kissed her head. Ibuki was terrified being so close to 
another woman but yet it felt very nice. Mai smelled her hair and 
touched it gently. 

&quot;Ibuki-chan, you are very beautiful.&quot; The kunoichi whispered and began 
stroking the ninja&#39;s hair. It was soft and easily stroked, yet stiff as 
it was tied hard, Mai could feel Ibuki&#39;s tension melt away with each 
stroke. It felt very good to the kunoichi and it helped to make her 
forget about her problems for a while. She decided to compliment the 
ninja to make her relax some more. 

&quot;Anyone would want you, sometimes even I am jealous at you, for being so
cute...&quot; Ibuki giggled as she heard this. 

&quot;You really think so? You don&#39;t think I am just a kid?&quot; 

&quot;No I don&#39;t.&quot; Mai said seriously. The kunoichi felt bad for the times 
when she had called Ibuki &quot;immature&quot; or &quot;childish&quot;. She understood now 
that this was in the smaller ninja&#39;s nature and she wanted to make up 
for it. 

&quot;I think you are a very handsome young girl, and Sakura should be very 
grateful for having such an adorable and wonderful fan.&quot; She said. 

Ibuki seemed happy for Mai&#39;s compliments and relaxed in her arms. Mai 
continued to stroke the smaller ninja. She stroked her hair and then her
back down to her hips. As she did Ibuki suddenly lifted her head and 
looked curiously at her. 

&quot;M-Mai?&quot; 

&quot;Yes my dear ninja?&quot; Mai said with a soft voice. 

&quot;Can you show me? H-How t-to...&quot; 

&quot;Very well then.&quot; Mai wasn&#39;t about to wait for anything that would take 
time at this moment. She grabbed Ibuki&#39;s head leaned over her pushing 
the younger ninja to her back. She placed her fingertip at Ibuki&#39;s nose 
and blew gently into her mouth as she gasped. Mai then pulled Ibuki&#39;s 
hand out of her kimono and kissed it. 

&quot;You always were my favorite student...&quot; She whispered. 

(Read on in Ibuki&#39;s Gift + part: 1 version at come.to/maryblue =) 

*** 

11:32 PM, Mary&#39;s roof. 

Dark Mai sighed as she lay down on the roof of the building of where 
Mary was living. It had been a busy day, but she liked it the most 
because she had some quality time with Mary. Most of the time had gone 
to her &quot;visit&quot;. The day after would be strenuous and everything had to 
click just right, or else it would be in vain. First she had to unarm 
Leona and then make sure she didn&#39;t kill the bounty hunter. 

&quot;Ca-chunk!&quot; 

&quot;What the???&quot; Dark Mai looked around and suddenly noticed a single 
glowing eye several yards from her. 

&quot;No!&quot; 

The sound of metallic knuckles crushing against each other filled the 
air. 

&quot;Please tell me that Jin didn&#39;t manage to make that hellish device 
work!&quot; 

The machine-like being walked up to her slowly and looked around. It 
looked like the perfect cyborg freak and its single glowing eye it was 
easy to intimidate even the mimic. 

&quot;Jin... wants you... dead.&quot; It said with a metallic almost watery voice.
In a split second it got into a fighting stance. &quot;Die...&quot; 

*** 

Outside Mary&#39;s apartment at 10:15 PM the next day. 

Mary was on her way to talk to her new love Mai, on her way out however 
she was confronted by Leona. 

&quot;Leona! What are you doing here?&quot; She asked as she could see Leona 
standing behind her. She turned around and faced the military woman. 

&quot;Where are you going!?&quot; Leona asked with a hard voice. Her look was 
unreadable but she sounded as if she was really pissed. 

&quot;Well I... I&#39;m going to Mai&#39;s place and...&quot; 

&quot;Over my dead body!&quot; Leona interrupted and pulled a rifle at the blonde 
for no obvious reason. She didn&#39;t make another move however. Mary didn&#39;t
see the point of this sudden hostility. Something that bothered her was 
the purple tone in Leona&#39;s usually blue hair. It was getting redder! 

&quot;Why is that I...&quot; She asked while moving away shocked by the fact that 
Leona was pulling weapons at her. 

&quot;You stole my Mai-san!&quot; The look in her eyes was mad and glowing. This 
was not the usual Leona. (More like a half transformed Orochi Leona.) 

&quot;What did you say?&quot; Mary said with a strong voice. &quot;Stole???&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t give me that!&quot; The almost blue haired woman almost shouted. &quot;I 
know what you&#39;re up to! Selfish bitch!&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t believe this has ANYTHING to do with you! And what the HELL are
you DOING waiting here with a frigging GUN outside my apartment???&quot; Mary
stood close and faced Leona directly. She obviously wouldn&#39;t take this. 

Leona&#39;s _expression was cold as usual but her eyes were burning. Burning
with hate, with desire, with anxiety, fear, madness, longing but most of
all her eyes burned with the black, aching and soul-destroying jealousy.
It was by mere luck that she had kept her sanity long enough to even 
challenge her rival. 

&quot;She is MY Mai-san! Why would you HAVE to crawl all over her like 
that!?&quot; Leona almost screamed. She lifted the rifle and aimed. &quot;But it 
doesn&#39;t matter, I WILL HURT YOU for this! It won&#39;t hurt as much as YOU 
have hurt ME, but I PROMISE you WILL feel it!!!&quot; 

Mary was still surprised by the sudden change of Leona. She had always 
been a very controlled and calm person. Even when she was fighting, Mary
had never seen her lost one bit of her cool appearance, but this? It was
like someone had torn out her heart and shoved a stake through it. 

&quot;Why would Mai be with both of us?&quot; Mary thought. &quot;She already has Andy,
and she had a problem with me as well. But Leona?&quot; 

&quot;What are you talking about, why are you doing this?&quot; Mary asked with 
the friendliest tone possible. She didn&#39;t like having a gun at her but 
she didn&#39;t have much to choose from, Leona seemed VERY upset. 

Leona managed to hold herself for a little while longer. 

&quot;This? Don&#39;t you get it? I&#39;m doing this because she loves ME!&quot; Leona 
replied quickly. &quot;We have something together... and that&#39;s us!&quot; Leona 
started feeling uneasy and somewhat cheap having to bring firearms; 
maybe if she aimed a little less accurate it would torment her victim a 
little more. 

Mary was suddenly confused in her thinking. She liked Mai. She loved her
and wanted her. She felt that it was right. It didn&#39;t have to be this 
complicated. Why? 

&quot;Yes... &quot; Mary replied insecurely. 

&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; Leona was thinking only of Mai and her mind was filled with
only this and the fury created by the insight that she might loose her, 
again. 

&quot;No don&#39;t!&quot; Mary tried to cover herself with her hands as she could see 
Leona&#39;s killing looks. 

&quot;I... I.... can&#39;t stand this!&quot; Leona screamed and fired. Mary ducked and
somehow managed to get inside without getting hit. She quickly ran back 
to her apartment. 

&quot;That was close. Mai where are you!?&quot; She said to herself while 
desperately trying to remember the kunoichi&#39;s phone number. She could 
soon hear her front door crash and she quickly vaulted a table to 
protect herself from the salvo of bullets flying through the door. 

Leona roared, threw the rifle away as its clip was empty and lashed 
against Mary. Any thought of reason was now gone. All that was left was 
desire, unbearable pain and hatred. 

&quot;DIE!&quot; She screamed as she lashed at Mary several times. Mary was strong
however and managed to block the strikes without even grinning. Leona 
continued her lashing. Furiously with no intention to stop she began 
knife-handing at every bit of Mary&#39;s body. Her hands blurred as they 
struck again and again. Mary tried to make advantage of the room they 
were in by moving to different defended places but she had never been 
good at fighting in narrow spaces. And Leona was after her wherever she 
decided to cover. 

After parrying and bleeding from the wounds created by the intense 
striking Mary noticed an opening. Leona left her chest open while 
lifting both her hands to strike again. Mary saw this and pushed forward
as quick as she could. The bounty hunter speared into Leona&#39;s stomach 
and the military woman soon felt a strong blow at the same spot. She 
lost her air and soon felt Mary&#39;s arm snaking around her neck. 

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry that we have to do this.&quot; Mary hissed and smashed 
Leona into the floor. She then grabbed Leona&#39;s arm and pulled it into 
her very own armlock with a snap. 

&quot;Gyaaahhh!!&quot; Leona screamed as her arm cracked under the force of the 
lock. It wasn&#39;t dislocated, yet, but it hurt intensively. 

&quot;You fool!&quot; She hissed and grabbed Mary by the neck with her free hand 
pressed hard enough to leave marks. The bounty hunter let go as she 
tried to gasp for air and quickly stood up while making her way out of 
the grapple. Leona was already on her feet however and managed to grab 
Mary&#39;s neck again. 

&quot;You&#39;ll regret that!&quot; She said loudly and punched her elbow into the 
bounty hunter&#39;s face twice with only half a second between the blows. 

Mary found this move a little peculiar as it resembled what had been 
done to her some days ago while fighting Dan, she didn&#39;t have much time 
to think about this however as Leona hurled her into a wall. Leona still
showed no signs of feelings. Not pitying or even patronizing her 
opponent. That it had gone this far was strange, Leona would normally 
have killed her victim already. She probably wanted to torment her rival
as long as possible. 

Leona stood still for a moment and watched her fallen opponent as if she
was checking to make sure whether she was dead or not. 

&quot;Why are we doing this?&quot; Mary said after a while as she tried to stand 
up. &quot;Is it because you can&#39;t live with the thought that Mai may like me 
too?&quot; She said feeling agony all the way from her neck down to her 
waist. 

&quot;Shut up!&quot; 

&quot;You know. *Cough*... This may come as a surprise but... It&#39;s up to her,
not us.&quot; 

&quot;SHUT UP!!!&quot; Leona screamed. She rushed towards Mary again but by 
lowering her guard she was struck again. 

Mary punched with both her fists in a full moon movement. As Leona 
stumbled, the blonde spin-kicked into her stomach and finished with an 
axe-kick that floored the military woman. After this Mary fell to her 
knee, already exhausted but mostly because of the sheer pain she felt 
through nearly her entire body. Leona&#39;s treatment had not done her any 
good. 

&quot;Huff... Let&#39;s end this nonsense.&quot; Mary said. Leona didn&#39;t answer
however. She stood up and looked at Mary with burning eyes. Blood
dripped from her mouth and she began spasming suddenly. 

&quot;Hey Leona what&#39;s th...&quot; 

&quot;Ah! Ah! Aaaagh!!!&quot; 

Her hair seemed to rise somewhat and began to change from blue-red into 
blood red. Her eyes became all white and her teeth seemed sharper. Mary 
didn&#39;t know what was happening but she knew that the creature in front 
of her was not Leona anymore. 

The creature snarled and looked around. With strange and animal-like 
movements she seemed to trace where Mary would be, with everything other
than her sight. All was red, red like crimson and red like blood. Leona 
knew little more as she felt the beast roaring from the bottom of her 
soul. She couldn&#39;t stop it, and she wouldn&#39;t, Mary would have her share.
Leona felt her mouth getting wet from the fluids mixing, blood and 
saliva. The sensation of pure adrenaline shot through her entire body. 
Her muscles cramped and she gave another cry of agony before loosing 
herself totally. 

&quot;This is bad, real bad...&quot; The blonde thought to herself. &quot;How can I
fight a creature like that... What should I do?&quot; 

Leona wasn&#39;t about to let Mary find the answer though. 

&quot;RRRAAAAHHHHH!!!&quot; She ran along the floor on all four with surprising 
speed. She grabbed Mary before the blonde could react, screamed and bit 
her shoulder like a mad vampire. 

Mary was shocked by the sudden move and desperately pushed the beast 
away from her. It was not a big injury but it left four bleeding marks 
close to her neck. 

&quot;Leona! What are you doing!?&quot; 

The creature didn&#39;t seem to hear her though and Leona quickly retaliated
as she was pushed away. She crouched, turned around and spun into a 
mighty right-handed blow. Mary managed to block this but was nearly 
thrown away from the force. It hurt, it hurt bad. But Mary wasn&#39;t about 
to give up. She had her own ideals and she wasn&#39;t about to loose them 
because Leona was in a bad mood. Mary punched against Leona. The blonde 
gave a long series of blows. High, low, turning, backwards, everything 
she got. 

Leona barely put effort in blocking. The only thing that kept her from 
attacking herself was the fact that Mary was attacking too fiercely and 
fast for a decent hit to get through. Leona snarled again as she took 
yet another fifteen series combo. 

Mary put all her might in her attempt to punch the creature down. But 
even her best shots seemed like they had no affect at all. Suddenly 
Leona lashed her arms to the sides and as Mary tried to punch between 
she realized why. Leona fell to her back and caught Mary in a kick with 
both her feet. She rolled backwards and sent the blonde flying. 

Mary was thrown to the floor several yards away. Her whole body burned 
and due to the stinging sensation she could barely move. Leona was 
strong, a bit too strong, all Mary had to give was not enough, and this 
was terrible. She heard Leona roar again. 

The Orochi woman grabbed Mary and she saw a knee dashing into her 
stomach and then the other into her head. Mary, barely conscious just 
managed to see her friend coming into her room, Mai was here, she was 
saved, she would sort this out and at least she was a better fighter 
than herself. 

&quot;M-Mai-san... uuuuhhhhh...&quot; And the bounty hunter knew no more. 

&quot;What are you doing!? Let her go!&quot; Mai cried. She was about to invite 
Mary to the cinema when she had heard screaming and racket. Not being 
the type that would run away from either a fight or a friend in need, 
she had naturally come to help, just like Dark Mai had planned. 

&quot;Uuuuuuhhhhh?&quot; She heard the possessed Leona grunt. The military woman 
looked at the unconscious blonde and with slight effort she then hurled 
Mary into another wall to her right. Mai was relieved when she confirmed
that her friend was still alive and breathing. Her attention quickly 
guided itself towards Leona though. 

With a rather unreadable _expression she seemed to observe the kunoichi,
down and up. Mai didn&#39;t know that since Leona saw everybody as red 
shadows she would normally not even notice who it was that she was about
to kill. And normally she would have given Mary the final strike already
but the kunoichi&#39;s presence stopped her somehow. She looked with empty 
eyes and hesitated for a moment. It looked as if she was discussing with
herself whether or not she would kill the kunoichi. After a brief second
of this however she snarled and lashed at Mai. The kunoichi was too fast
however, she rolled to the side and quickly changed into her fighting 
outfit. (How does she do that? I guess we&#39;ll never know.) 

&quot;Leona? Snap out of it!&quot; She cried as Leona nearly destroyed a wall 
behind the kunoichi after failing to connect her hit. Leona had never 
been this furious before, she chased the kunoichi all over the room 
leaving no space for the kunoichi to retaliate. After seeing Leona ruin 
most of the apartment Mai had a shot. She ran against the wall of where 
Mary was lying, jumped and bounced back after turning and flip-kicked 
with both her feet. Leona dodged this and there was a huge crash as the 
Orochi-woman plunged into the wall. 

&quot;M-Mai...&quot; Mary whispered. 

Mai crouched to look after friend. She would have at least a couple of 
seconds to move Mary out of the way. But as she tried to lift the bounty
hunter up she could hear a roar. 

Leona rushed at her again and caught the kunoichi who was too busy with 
pulling Mary away with a spear-tackle. 

&quot;Get away!&quot; Mai said to Mary as she managed to push the bounty hunter 
away and into a briefly safe place. By doing this Mai had no chance to 
parry what so ever and she took the hit herself. She fell backwards by 
the force and then felt Leona&#39;s foot slamming into her stomach. The 
Orochi then threw herself over the kunoichi and placed her hand at the 
kunoichi&#39;s chest. 

&quot;Nani...&quot; But Leona&#39;s eyes changed back and she pulled back in horror. 
What was she doing? 

Mai looked at Leona who crashed into the floor. She was shivering and 
sweating all over while curling into a ball and covering her face. 

She made sure Mary was okay and put the bounty hunter into her bed for 
some rest. She would probably recover soon enough. She wanted to talk to
that crazed military girl however. 

&quot;Now what the hell was that?&quot; Mai demanded as she returned to the room 
where Leona was still lying and shivering. It took a full minute before 
Mai attempted to ask again. 

&quot;I know what you want!&quot; Leona said suddenly and sat up. &quot;Some tea 
right?&quot; 

Mai growled slightly of tiredness. &quot;This is not your apartment.&quot; She 
merely stated. 

&quot;You&#39;ll stay for tea right?&quot; Leona asked &quot;Iori should be waiting at my 
apartment, but I wanted to talk to you first.&quot; She said while making 
some water ready on the small stove. 

&quot;You know I am really sorry about this... but I... had to do 
something... and besides Mary is alright, right?&quot; Leona said while 
thinking &quot;By mere luck!&quot; without feeling at least sorry for her. 

&quot;Mai? You hear me?&quot; 

&quot;YES!&quot; Mai cried irritated. She didn&#39;t have the energy to think about 
this now, she was just glad everything had calmed down. But thinking as 
how Mary was lying knocked out in her bed and with Leona still running 
around in the trashed apartment made her worry. 

&quot;You&#39;re not mad at me right?&quot; 

Mai tried hard to get her thoughts arranged and sighed. 

&quot;No, of course not... why would I be?&quot; The kunoichi growled. The 
military woman got back and gave her a cup of tea. &quot;Enough?&quot; Leona 
asked. 

&quot;I think so...&quot; Mai answered with a slurry voice as she tried drinking 
some of it. The tea was too hot however as Leona had used to microwave 
for a faster effect. &quot;Now do you mind telling me what is going on?&quot; 

&quot;Fine, then we can talk right?&quot; Both of them were really tired and 
exhausted mostly Mai who was nearly knocked out for several reasons. 

&quot;Well...?&quot; Mai asked as she had no idea what had happened before she got
to Mary&#39;s apartment. 

&quot;Uhm... Well I don&#39;t know... I went into a rage and I don&#39;t remember 
anything after that...&quot; Leona said and damned herself for such a 
terrible lie. She didn&#39;t want to scare Mai away from herself though. 

&quot;Oh... &quot; Mai said and looked worriedly at Mary&#39;s apartment. &quot;And who is 
going to pay for this mess??&quot; 

Leona&#39;s lie was killing her. &quot;The Ikari team will...&quot; She sighed. This 
was however the only way she could think of to make Mai hers. &quot;Come 
on... You have to tell her.&quot; She said trying to get off the subject. 

&quot;Tell her what?&quot; Mai asked in confusion as she walked around the room. 

&quot;About us, you know the time in the park... in the bar... and... &quot; Leona
blushed. &quot;In my apartment... You remember what a great time we had 
then?&quot; 

Mai shook her head. &quot;What was she talking about anyway?&quot; 

&quot;You are so beautiful my Mai-chan... You know that?&quot; Leona said as she 
stretched to begin stroking the kunoichi&#39;s hair. 

&quot;Well I...&quot; 

A sudden crash brought Leona&#39;s move to a halt. She looked around and 
suddenly something smashed through the wall. It looked like a human, 
just covered in metal with a single glowing eye. its head twitched 
slightly as it looked around. 

&quot;MAI!&quot; It cried and lifted its sword to strike the kunoichi down. Mai 
rolled out of the bed and got into her stance. Leona did as well. 

&quot;GIVE!&quot; It cried again and its sword cut mercilessly through the air. 
Mai managed to dodge this and Leona got to the side of the machine and 
kicked it in the stomach. 

&quot;DARK!&quot; It grunted and pushed Leona out of the way. 

&quot;MAI!&quot; The kunoichi looked as the walking battle armor confronted her. 
Sure she was trained for this, being attacked in her sleep. But this was
some sort of mechanical beast or cyborg and she didn&#39;t know how to fight
those. As it came closer she spun around to flame it. 

&quot;MAIIIII!&quot; It shrieked as it got burnt. The was still advancing however 
and lifted its sword to dish out a fatal blow. 

&quot;Oh no you won&#39;t!&quot; 

Leona blocked the cyborg&#39;s sword with her arm. 

&quot;Foool.&quot; The mysterious figure answered. As it turned and lashed the 
sword again Leona reached for her AK-47 lying on the table beside her. 

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that!&quot; She said as soon as she got it and aimed for the 
head pushing it up against the cyborg&#39;s chin. The blade stopped 
abruptly. It was hanging only centimeters from her neck but she had 
gotten her hand to the rifle. 

&quot;I bet even that steel-plate armor of yours can&#39;t stand against twenty 
rounds of burning lead!&quot; The cyborg hesitated for a second while looking
around moving only its eye. It looked like they would finish each other 
off as soon as one of them made a move. 

&quot;Mai, do you hear me?&quot; Leona said without making another move. &quot;Do me a 
favor. Don&#39;t do ANYTHING, just walk out of here.&quot; Mai heard but she 
didn&#39;t walk away, not with Leona in this dead man&#39;s lock. 

&quot;No! I can&#39;t!&quot; She replied. She knew that a sudden move from her side 
would result in Leona loosing her neck. 

&quot;Just go dammit! I&#39;ll be fine!&quot; 

&quot;NO!&quot; 

&quot;Trust me! Now GO, slowly.&quot; Mai shook her head and moved silently across
the room. Was Leona patronizing her ability to move silently? Why did 
this have to happen now of all times? All she wanted was to clear up the
mess between her friends and this assassin from hell had to show. She 
could take that thing on any other day. The robot-like creature&#39;s one 
eye stopped and didn&#39;t move from Leona. It just stared, as if to wait 
for any movement, weakness or anything else that would disrupt the 
military woman&#39;s concentration. 

Suddenly Leona noticed a strange noise from the hunk of steel in front 
of her, laughter??? 

&quot;Mai duck!&quot; She shouted and then threw herself to the floor and thereby 
dodged the swipe barely. There was a not very deep cut and blood running
down her throat. She didn&#39;t care however and pulled the rifle with her. 
Before she hit the floor however the cyborg kicked the AK out of her 
hands and threw the sword against her. The blue haired woman rolled to 
the side and threw herself against Mai who had ducked beside the door. 
The noise from the cyborg got louder. The rifle landed in one of its 
hands and the cyborg quickly pulled safety back. 

&quot;SHI-NE!&quot; It said coldly and opened fire against Mai. Leona was already 
there however and pushed Mai down covering her with her own body. The 
cyborg showed no intention to stop however and emptied the clip fully 
into Leona&#39;s back. The military woman screamed but refused to move out 
of the way until the cyborg had stopped firing. 

&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry Mai... I... couldn&#39;t...&quot; She coughed blood and fell to
the side. 

&quot;Noooooo!&quot; Mai cried finally awake. &quot;It was me... it should&#39;ve been me!&quot;
Was she dead? Mai panicked, grabbed her friend and looked for any life 
signs. Leona was pale and didn&#39;t seem to be breathing. Nothing else 
would matter right now. The whole world seemed to have stopped. The 
kunoichi would do anything just to at least be able to hear any final 
words from the military woman. She hugged the lifeless body of Leona 
hard and she felt tears run down her cheeks. 

&quot;Leonaaaa...&quot; She whimpered.
