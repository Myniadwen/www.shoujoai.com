<h1>For the Love of Mary Blue (part 3 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kfighters/index.html">King of Fighters</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hexelf.html">Hex Elf</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kfighters/maryblue-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;H... *cough*... hurry!&quot; Leona suddenly managed to whisper. 

&quot;What!?&quot; She was alive! &quot;Leona, hang in there!&quot; Mai lifted Leona&#39;s head 
to her chest and stroked her hair, she was still crying and pleading for
Leona to stay alive. Of course Leona would have greatly appreciated the 
gesture but this wasn&#39;t really the time or place. 

&quot;You can do it right?&quot; Mai asked with a shivering voice. &quot;Tell me...&quot; 

&quot;Sh... shut up you fool... run...&quot; Leona said with a somewhat annoyed 
voice. 

Mai noticed Leona shivering and having trouble breathing. 

&quot;F-for me... r-run...&quot; She whispered before giving an _expression of 
sheer 
agony. She screamed and threw herself forward. 

&quot;I&#39;ll get help. I&#39;ll go get Iori, just hang in there!&quot; Mai cried to her 
friend as she could see her loosing to the Orochi. 

&quot;Don&#39;t give in until I get back you hear!&quot; Somehow Mai felt that there 
was no way that Leona would let herself do that but she had to hurry or 
else it would make no difference what she thought. 

Leona was now breathing hard and husky. 

She looked at the metallic warrior who had assaulted them. It was 
standing between them and the only safe exit in the room. It had thrown 
the rifle away and had its sword again. It seemed like it had some honor
not attacking the ravaged Leona. Instead it waited patiently in a 
battle-stance. This seemed like strange acting, as it would have been a 
better idea to strike her down right then. Maybe the sudden Orochi aura 
had interrupted its attack. 

Mai knew that the only seemingly possible way to beat this thing in 
close combat would be by using the force of the Orochi; you can&#39;t beat a
robot unconscious right? Leona however wasn&#39;t in a very good shape. She 
should&#39;ve been dead from the injuries; it was a miracle just that she 
was still breathing. This Orochi character sure was careful not to let 
his warriors die without one hell of a fight. She figured that if she 
could find Iori he would surely recognize the metallic creature as his 
enemy even in Orochi form. 

&quot;He was supposed to be waiting for Leona at her apartment right?&quot; The 
kunoichi thought. 

&quot;Guess what... you m... *cough*... monster...&quot; Leona said weakly. &quot;You 
just... 
fucked up... really *cough*... really... bad...&quot; 

The machine looked at her as if she broke its concentration. 

&quot;Ah! Ah! GAAAAHHH!!!&quot; After another violent transformation the 
military woman quickly stood up and looked around with an animalic look.
She looked at the cyborg with empty eyes and it seemed like she picked 
it to be her immediate enemy directly. Mai couldn&#39;t trust that Leona 
would help her but at least it seemed like she would fight the metal 
beast and not her. This was the moment to escape if she would ever get 
one; Leona was going to be all right for a while longer and at least she
wouldn&#39;t mind Mai escaping for a while. 

Leona could see the cold shadow in front of her. Just another foe stupid
enough to be in her way. Her blood boiled with rage as she felt her 
adrenaline build to inhuman levels. She hurled herself at the cyborg 
with extraordinary force and landed her feet at its chest while she 
grabbed its head with her hands. She pulled her right hand back and then
punched with the full force of an Orochi. With a bolt of purple energy 
the metallic creature was thrown back. It crashed through the door 
behind and was hurled into a wall. Leona was soon over it again. She 
grabbed its wrists and after struggling for several seconds she 
registered a satisfying crack... as the outer armor cracked. 

&quot;Feeble!&quot; The cyborg roared and head-butted the Orochi. Leona was 
blinded temporarily but as she could see the cyborg going after Mai she 
registered something else. 

&quot;MAI-SAANN!!!&quot; She roared and again shot herself at the moving metal. 
She couldn&#39;t grab it from the behind as it turned around and struck her 
to the ground. Leona fell to her stomach and felt the sword stabbing 
into her back. All her senses were blocked by the agony. Her vision 
faded and her hearing was gone. But however much it hurt it couldn&#39;t 
block out one thing. Mai. 

&quot;Protect... Mai... SAAAAHHH!!!&quot; The cyborg pulled its sword back but 
soon the invincible force of the Orochi struck it once more. Leona&#39;s
hand had lashed with blinding speed and there was now a large cut
where the heart should&#39;ve been. 

&quot;IMPRESSIVE!&quot; The cyborg grunted even though the cut wasn&#39;t deep enough 
to penetrate its armor. Leona wasn&#39;t done however. As long as the 
techno-chunk was mobile there was no way that she would leave it out of 
her sight. The little mind she had left told her that if she couldn&#39;t 
protect Mai she could as well die anyway. And the Orochi wasn&#39;t about to
let that happen. 

She traced were there was most heat in the shadow in front of her. She 
grabbed the throat of the cyborg lifted it and smashed into the other 
wall. The machine grunted and grabbed her wrist, twisted it and elbowed 
her stomach with the other arm. Leona grinned and grabbed the cyborg&#39;s 
hand, pulled them in a 180 circle and slammed it into the wall one meter
further down the corridor. The cyborg retaliated and punched at her. 
Leona slid under the blow and the force of the combatants had destroyed 
yet another wall. 

*** 

Ten minutes later in Desert Flower, Leona&#39;s room. 

Iori was beginning to wonder whether Leona was about to come back to him
or not. Maybe she had decided to say with one of THEM!? He sat silently 
in the room that Leona had reserved. He had covered the windows as the 
sun had been giving him a headache and the room was quite dark. 

Iori sighed once again. She wouldn&#39;t do that would she? She wouldn&#39;t run
of like a crazy teenager to be with another one. No, Leona wasn&#39;t like 
that. She had told him how interested she was in one of them, that &quot;Mai&quot;
character. Okay so she was good looking but Iori only had eyes for 
Leona. She had something that Mai lacked. He didn&#39;t know what, but it 
was there. 

Anyway, Leona seemed equally interested in both of them, which Iori had 
no problem with, as long as she would return to him in the end. Iori was
a very patient man when it came to things like this, and he was 
definitely not prejudiced; if you didn&#39;t count his more or less infinite
hate towards the Kusanagi&#39;s that is. 

Leona would come back, she had promised, he was just losing some his 
patience that&#39;s all. Iori lay to his back in the couch and tried to 
sleep. His sensitive nose (He is partly Orochi, okay?) recognized some 
of the smells from the piece of furniture. Leona, he smiled, and one 
other. Must be from the night she was talking about Iori thought. The 
crimson haired man was too tired to care however and soon felt sleep 
beginning to embrace him. 

&quot;Iori! Thank god you&#39;re here, come quick!&quot; The Yagami barely moved as he
heard the voice. 

&quot;What now? Leave me alone!&quot; He replied harshly. 

&quot;You got get to Mary&#39;s apartment, Leona and...&quot; 

&quot;WHAT!&quot; Iori quickly stood and looked around. One of the windows was now
open and in it a shadowy figure sat and looked at him. The light was too
strong for him to recognize who it was; he could only make out the 
glowing eyes. 

&quot;Leona! What has happened!&quot; He cried. The shadow jumped into the room 
and Iori recognized the person, Mai. &quot;What have you done to her!?&quot; 

&quot;I haven&#39;t done anything, she... called me to her hideout and all of the
sudden there was this crazy robot of some sort that tried to kill us. I 
think it was after me since it called my name all the time and...&quot; From 
her tone of voice it seemed like Mai was almost as worried as the Yagami
was beginning to feel. 

*** 

The cyborg crashed into another room and turning around it faced Leona 
drop kicking. Leona pushed hard and she landed at the machine in the 
same position as before, she leaned forward and they both crashed 
through a window, three stores high. 

Leona fought hard to stay on top of her foe. The cyborg lashed at her 
several times injuring the Orochi&#39;s front as well. Hopefully none of 
that would matter in a couple of seconds. Leona received a bruise from 
the large blade in her arm, but then they crashed into the ground. Maybe
she had succeeded. 

Leona grabbed the head of the cyborg. It had tried to hurt Mai. It had 
tried to kill Mai. Leona&#39;s blood boiled still. Despite the fact that she
should&#39;ve been dead long ago from her injures. Despite the fact that she
was almost rendered unconscious from sheer blood loss. She had won. It 
was NOT going to hurt Mai, but just to make sure... 

&quot;You... hurt... ma... Mai... sss... san... fo... for that... I&#39;ll kill 
you... HOOAAHH!&quot; She grabbed the head of the robot and smashed it into
the ground. It felt good, very good, and in an orgy of literal brain-
smashing Leona slammed its head into the ground again, again and again.
The cyborg didn&#39;t do anything to retaliate. Leona screamed while she
charged her Orochi power to the maximum and channeled all of the force
through the lifeless, metallic body. The explosion made a great crater
in the ground and her opponent seemed finished. 

Leona panted and looked around her. A mass of people had gathered around
her. The Orochi tried to think but soon she could hear a familiar voice.

&quot;Good my child. Here is your reward. Kill them... Kill them all and feel
the joy...&quot; 

Leona grunted and stood up. Her wounds didn&#39;t bother her anymore. She 
felt nothing. She was Orochi, it had taken all of her mind. 

After another savage roar she took a quick look. So many bodies. So much
blood. She smiled and rushed towards the mass. Leona had forgotten about
the cyborg and began chasing the people around her instead. 

***

&quot;What did you say!?&quot; Iori almost screamed. &quot;You left her! What kind of a
friend are you anyway???&quot; 

Mai gasped as she heard Iori&#39;s hard words. 

&quot;I... I didn&#39;t know what else to do. I had to get help.&quot; 

Iori turned to his side. &quot;No use in arguing now, tell me quickly. A 
cyborg you said?&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s something mechanical at least. It&#39;s made all out metal. You can&#39;t 
strike through its armor. You would...&quot; 

&quot;Okay!&quot; Iori disrupted. &quot;I don&#39;t care anyway. If the bastard has cut one
strand of Leona&#39;s hair he will need plastic surgery to put him together,
that is, if they manage find all the missing pieces!&quot; 

&quot;Actually...&quot; But Iori was already gone. Maybe it would not have been 
such 
a good idea to tell him that Leona took a full clip of bullets to save 
her after all. Mai knew one thing from this: Unless you&#39;re a Kusanagi, 
DO NOT mess with a Yagami, and if you are not looking for a certain 
death, don&#39;t even THINK about messing with a Yagami&#39;s beloved. Mai 
sighed and disappeared out the window. 

*** 

Many fled in panic as Leona hunted them down, one by one. Everyone she 
couldn&#39;t reach she threw either a Orochi projectile or her moon shaped 
hairpiece at. Efficiency. 

She stabbed several men in their backs. She enjoyed how easy it was to 
strike them down. Anyone she didn&#39;t kill with the first blow she quickly
finished with another. This was life, this sweetness of power. She used 
it. She was far from the place where she had landed but she noticed 
several shadows running away from her. They had hidden behind her. She 
had run past them. Leona wasn&#39;t about to let her mistake run away. She 
roared and turned around. 1, 4, 5... a family maybe? She didn&#39;t care. 
She 
slammed her hands into the ground and ran after them on all four. She 
grabbed the largest of them, slammed him into the ground and with a 
satisfying noise she felt his ribs breaking and his heart stopping under
her strike. Leona gasped of joy as she confirmed another kill. She felt 
blood in her mouth. The sweet, sweet taste running down her throat. 

Four more, she soon grabbed another one. With her sharp claws she ripped
his throat to shreds; he would die soon. 

Three more. She caught two of them. She stabbed one in the back, turned 
the other around and just for fun she stabbed the real knife into her 
instead. 

One more, a small one. Leona managed to grab her as well and the little 
girl screamed. Leona had no regrets however and annoyingly easy the 
girl&#39;s neck napped. Leona looked around. All dead, no one around except 
for a possible to the left. Leona gazed in that direction and noticed 
two shadows. The cyborg and... Mai? The energies where the same, but... 
That was enough. Leona hurled herself against the cyborg, grabbed the
woman and barely avoided being cut in half. 

So the cyborg was still alive? Leona&#39;s control slipped back somewhat, 
the pain returned as she managed to suppress the Orochi a little. The 
metallic hunk was obviously not happy with Leona interrupting, again. It
roared and suddenly it fought every bit more efficient than it had 
before. The metallic killer swiped its sword all over just barely 
missing every time. Leona knew that she wouldn&#39;t be able to keep this up
much longer, and if she lost what little control she had the Orochi 
would surely leave Mai behind just to get away. 

She carried the woman and all the time protecting her with her body. 
Anyone would be amazed by the amount of punishment the Orochi woman 
could take. Leona didn&#39;t think however, she hadn&#39;t been for a long time.
She acted on instinct, and her instinct told her to protect Mai no 
matter what. 

Leona gasped as another strike was dealt to her back. She couldn&#39;t fight
and protect someone at the same time. Damn, why would Mai have to be 
there... no it wasn&#39;t Mai&#39;s fault... Leona hadn&#39;t been able to finish of
the cyborg; it was her fault. Leona felt herself losing her Orochi
powers and slowly turning back to normal, she would have to rest soon or
she would surely die... fending off the cyborg was too much... she had
taken more wounds and blows than she had ever done before... this wasn&#39;t
good. She placed Mai in front of her... 

&quot;Good bye... my dear... k-kunoichi... Run...&quot; She quickly kissed the 
kunoichi, sighed and attacked the cyborg once more in a desperate
attempt to buy Mai some time. The Cyborg didn&#39;t bother to fight her
at first but as she grabbed its waist as it tried to pass her it made
a roaring noise and raised its sword to finish her off once and for all.

&quot;Leona!&quot; Mai cried. The military woman slipped and fell lifeless to the 
ground. With this the cyborg brought its attention towards the kunoichi.
It grabbed the falling Leona and sent her flying several yards before 
lowering its blade. It looked around quickly before running at its 
target. The girl that Leona had been holding also ran away from her and 
the kunoichi was very confused as she recognized the girl&#39;s ki to be 
very similar to her own. She hadn&#39;t the time to think about this 
however. 

&quot;Come here, quickly!&quot; She called to the girl. Behind the kunoichi 
another character appeared. He had seen what happened and he was not 
very happy. He wasn&#39;t the sensitive type and although Leona meant the 
world to him Iori was still quite calm. 

&quot;Okay Mai, this is obviously for both of us, keep that girl safe and 
I&#39;ll take care of this mister no-better-than-spare-parts here.&quot; He 
turned to the cyborg and lifted his hands. 

&quot;Let me explain a few rules from Yagami&#39;s bible of life. You&#39;re a 
Kusanagi, you die. You hurt a Yagami, you&#39;ll die. You hurt my Leona, and
I&#39;ll personally make sure that hell will appear as a playground for 
kiddies compared to what you&#39;re about to experience! SHI-NE!&quot; Iori cried
and sent a purple wave hurdling towards his opponent. The ground was 
ripped apart as a powerful fire wave crushed through it. The cyborg 
easily evaded the flame and walked towards Mai. Before it reached her 
however Iori got in its way and lifted his hand. In his palm another 
flame was created. The cyborg&#39;s one eye blinked and the whole machine 
wheeled to the side as Iori sent another wave of fire in that direction.

Iori had been expecting that and quickly followed up. He turned at 
blurring speed and kicked the cyborg&#39;s head. Its body went down a bit 
but the metallic assassin quickly retaliated. Its sword cut through the 
air and Iori barely evaded it. He ducked and then run into the chunk of 
metal. 

&quot;Let&#39;s see how you like this!&quot; 

He grabbed its throat, sent the machine into the ground and channeled a 
stream of fire into its body. The cyborg grunted but soon sent the 
crimson haired man flying with a mighty uppercut. 

&quot;KA-CHO-SEN!&quot; Mai cried and a fan struck the Cyborg&#39;s chest. It bounced 
off and the living metal chunk quickly moved towards her. 

&quot;Don&#39;t!&quot; Iori said harshly. &quot;Keep away! If it gets you it&#39;ll surely 
disappear again. Go check Leona instead!&quot; Mai hesitated but then moved 
away from the fight. She kneeled before Leona and gasped as she saw how 
badly injured she was. She was still Orochi, that was the only reason 
she could live. The kunoichi stroked Leona&#39;s cheeks and whispered to 
her. She whispered some of all the hundreds of reasons why she wanted 
the military woman to survive. She whispered all of the loving words she
came to think of. 

&quot;And as for you!&quot; Iori said calmly and placed his hand on the cyborg&#39;s 
shoulder &quot;We&#39;re not done yet!&quot; 

The thing... seemed to remember this and quickly ducked to get his hand 
away. An explosion of purple fire ripped through the air. The cyborg 
turned around and speared its sword. Iori avoided this and hit the 
machine&#39;s head with all his might. 

&quot;OUCH!!! I&#39;d like to see a Kusanagi perform that move.&quot; He said 
sarcastically and avoided yet another blow. The robot lashed with its 
sword and threw it up into the air. It kicked Iori&#39;s leg, grabbed his 
back and pushed him down, right into its knee. With a smack the Yagami&#39;s
head met steel. Dizzy but still capable of fighting Iori rolled away as 
he knew what was coming. Soon the sword hit the ground where he was 
supposed to have been. The machine picked the blade up and lashed again.

&quot;Hey, we have to do something about this armor!&quot; Iori shouted to Mai. He
could see the kunoichi touching the lifeless body of his love. She 
stroked the chest of the pale Leona as if to find something that could 
bring her back. 

&quot;It was like Leona said then.&quot; The Yagami thought. &quot;It is for real.&quot; 

Lost in his thoughts Iori didn&#39;t see a kick coming. It hit his belly and
he bent under the blow but threw himself back again as a fatal sweep 
that would have cut his head of came falling down. 

&quot;Enough play!&quot; He couldn&#39;t stand to see his love in that lifeless shape.
He had to do something. He felt the Orochi roar inside him. Screaming 
for release. He felt the bonds that kept it hidden away in the bottom of
his consciousness slowly breaking. 

Iori gave the robot&#39;s eye a test of might as he punched it with all of 
his power. Nothing happened however and the Cyborg retaliated by 
grabbing his hand. With a nasty throw the Cyborg sent the Yagami into 
the ground once more. The blade of its sword lashed against Iori&#39;s chest
and this time wasn&#39;t able to avoid it. He screamed as he felt blood all 
over his shirt. 

&quot;Very... bad... move!&quot; He cried and tried to get up. 

He grabbed the sword and with burning eyes he kicked the cyborg away. He
stood up and threw the sword away. 

As the raging half beast looked around the cyborg was already on its way
towards Mai, and with Mai was Leona. Iori roared and with a low pose he 
ran after the machine. 

As he got there the cyborg turned around and let a left hook sweep 
through the air. Iori easily caught this and gave the metallic figure 
taste one of his own. This punch was strong enough to send the cyborg 
falling to the ground. The metallic assassin grunted and seemed 
surprised by the sudden strength of its opponent. 

It stood up quickly and after vaulting to its weapon and picking it up 
the cyborg lashed with the sword swiftly in a circle. The sword gave a 
strange glow and as it struck into the ground there was a powerful bolt 
striking through the sword and into the asphalt. Iori had been out of 
the way a long time. The machine seemed to sigh, lifted the sword and 
ran after Iori. 

Furiously striking with no stopping it seemed like Iori would soon be a 
mere shred of his former self, literally. As he tried to retaliate he 
was cut and injured severely in his side. The metallic creature was 
advancing faster than the Orochi could back off and soon Iori was 
grabbed in a painful arm lock. The cyborg quickly tried to finish the 
Orochi off but its arm was grabbed by the kunoichi. She was in the fight
again, her eyes were red with anger and she couldn&#39;t watch any longer. 

She pulled with all her strength to hinder the cyborg from striking. It 
quickly made a change of plans and impossibly fast grabbed Mai&#39;s neck 
with its free arm. The kunoichi gasped for air as she was lifted. No 
matter how she struggled she couldn&#39;t get loose from the cyborg&#39;s 
metallic grip. As it was about to strike however Iori managed to grab it
from behind. He roared and pulled it back and down. 

The machine&#39;s back was nearly broken while the Orochi pulled it 
backwards and into the ground. To regain balance the metallic figure 
loosened its grip of Mai and faced the Orochi once more. They stood and 
looked at each other for several seconds. Both took several steps 
backwards and snarled simultaneously. Iori thinking not of much else 
than what the Orochi told him to. The cyborg giving its unreadable 
expression. 

Orochi didn&#39;t understand how such a feeble and obviously low-spirited 
creature had managed to defeat one of its finest minions. It wasn&#39;t 
about to repeat the mistake however and decided to finish off the pesky 
nuisance as soon as possible. 

&quot;Know your enemy!&quot; a voice inside Iori&#39;s head said with an echoing mans 
voice. 

&quot;WWWOOOOOAAAAAHHHH!!!&quot; Iori foamed with rage. He screamed and rushed 
towards the cyborg. Suddenly his world was clear. He would do this... it
was for Orochi... for Yagami... for Leona... and Mai... he couldn&#39;t help
this... 
he was envious and wanted Leona for himself... nevertheless he would 
fight 
to the death for their future together... his... and theirs... 

The cyborg blinked, readied its sword and rushed as well. 

The two creatures met and there was a bloody collision. Iori&#39;s hand cut 
over the cyborg&#39;s throat and barely didn&#39;t tear the head with it. His 
rival had injured him again and his left arm was dripping with blood. 
Iori turned immediately and attacked again. He landed his hand at the 
Cyborg&#39;s shoulder and ripped a great chunk of metal with it. It seemed 
like the machine possessed several shells and that this was but the 
first. 

This didn&#39;t bother Iori the least however and he immediately followed up
with another furious attack. With this he grabbed the cyborg&#39;s left 
wrist and nearly crushed it. The metallic being was still fully capable 
of fighting though and the sword made a large scar along the Yagami&#39;s 
chest. Iori rolled away to recover. He was still foaming and his eyes 
burned with rage. He wouldn&#39;t give up, pain was nothing he wasn&#39;t used 
to. He felt blood running through his throat and the Orochi let it run 
to its lips. Why didn&#39;t the cyborg attack? 

Because Mai was gone, it would have to find her first, the Orochi wasn&#39;t
important. The cyborg began scanning the area; Leona was gone as well, 
and the &quot;other&quot; Mai. Iori used this and with a cataclysm of pure rage he
stormed into the metal. He roared and struck it down. He was over it and
ripped its chest open, the first, the second and the third shell. He 
couldn&#39;t rip the third so he began hammering on it, one, two, three 
blows. Hopeless, he roared and gave a final attempt. 

&quot;HHOOOOAAAA!!!&quot; 

The earth shattered as an explosion of raw Orochi energy was 
concentrated to one spot. The cyborg roared as its chest burst open. 
With a white light the soul contained within the shell exploded and 
vanished into thin air. 

Iori turned back to normal. He laughed. He laughed more and more with 
increasing density. Blood ran from his eyes, mouth and nostrils. 

&quot;I-Iori?&quot; It was Mai. 

&quot;He... Mai... I&#39;m fine! Where&#39;s Leona... ahhhh?&quot; The crimson haired man 
grunted as he fainted and hit the ground with a *thud*. 

***

Mary&#39;s apartment, 12:35 AM 

Mary growled as she finally woke up. She looked around with a blurred 
vision and remembered what had happened. Where was Mai? Had Leona taken 
her. She had been knocked out for a long time. 

&quot;Oh god, my apartment!&quot; The blonde cried as she stood up. &quot;Leona, you 
will pay for this!&quot; 

That&#39;s right. Mai. She had to find out where Mai was. Maybe she was at 
home? 

***

Meanwhile at Mai&#39;s training grounds. 

Leona and Iori were brought to Mai&#39;s training grounds. Mai called for 
Ibuki and they helped with carrying the lifeless bodies. A girl who 
called herself Whip had appeared and had lots of medical equipment with 
her. She insisted that she would take care of the injured rather than 
calling for an ambulance. Also by some unknown reason the girl seemed 
reluctant to ever leave Leona&#39;s side even though none of the people 
involved recognized her. Mai had got additional help from her friends 
Eiji and Ibuki to carry the injured. As they got into the bedroom the 
phone suddenly rang. 

&quot;Yes... Mary... What&#39;s wrong? Leona, yes she is he... What??? I&#39;m sorry 
but I 
am needed here. Please come by and we can talk ok? Thanks...&quot; She put 
the 
phone down. &quot;What is going on anyway.&quot; She thought to herself. 

Whip stayed by Leona&#39;s side and kept asking Mai questions about what had
happened the military woman. The kunoichi didn&#39;t feel that this was 
strange as she seemed to know Leona. She answered the stream of 
questions as good as she could while helping in taking care of Leona&#39;s 
wounds. 

*** 

Mary apartment, 20 minutes later. 

Dark Mai sighed. Not only was she was tired from running from that 
cyborg but now Mary was gone. She was happy that her plan had worked 
despite the interference though. She still had enough energy to use some
of her psychic abilities. Her legs hurt badly, never before had she had 
to use so much physical strength to evade being killed. She was thankful
of Leona saving her but she&#39;d rather not risk being spotted, not yet at 
least. 

&quot;I mean that thing, it was EVERYWHERE!!!&quot; She thought. &quot;No matter where 
I hid it was there within like two minutes!&quot; She felt she could really 
use one of Mary&#39;s treatments right now. Since she was such an expert in 
breaking people&#39;s bones and giving muscle aches maybe she would be good 
in the opposite. Dark Mai twitched her head as she felt on her wound she
received from the raging cyborg&#39;s first attack. 

&quot;What would the IQ be on such a thing? The only thing it seemed to know 
was, tracking, insulting and killing.&quot; She thought when she remembered 
the constant haggle of patronizing comments that the cyborg mumbled 
while chasing or fighting her. 

&quot;Probably ten times that of Andy, HA HA HA HA HA, ngh!!!&quot; The mimic 
moaned as she felt the pain return. It was a deep scar in her side, but 
at least it was not bleeding. Mai was a skilled medic it seemed she 
always took care of the wounded. Dark Mai had to take care of herself 
this time and it seemed fine. She hid the wound and the bandage under
the suit and set off to finish what she started. 

*** 

Mai&#39;s training grounds 1:20 PM minutes later. 

As Mary rushed through the door she found Mai in a shape that seemed 
just fine. She was happy to see that she was okay. Something else made 
her change the temper however. 

&quot;Leona! That damn bitch!!!&quot; Ibuki managed to get grip on the bounty 
hunter. She barely could to hold Mary and hinder her from attacking the 
unconscious military woman. 

&quot;Let me go! That bitch tried to kill me! LET ME GO! Leona, I&#39;ll show you
who is the right one, just you wait!&quot; She struggled like a wild animal 
as Ibuki desperately tried to hold her still. Even the young ninja&#39;s 
superbly trained body had trouble with this, however in Mary&#39;s injured 
state Ibuki and Mai was finally able to get her out of the room. 

&quot;Calm down... please Mary.&quot; Mai said to her as Ibuki pulled away and sat
down in a chair near the door. &quot;Why are you so angry?&quot; 

&quot;WHAT!? She just HAPPENED to bust into my house, pull a gun at me and 
then turn into GOD KNOWS WHAT to proceed with beating the living hell 
out of me. And all this in a matter of minutes.&quot; 

Mai tried to reason with Mary and make sure that she wouldn&#39;t run off. 
The blonde seemed to be cooperative at the moment though and stayed as 
Mai let her go. 

&quot;Its because she was mad at you for some reason, if she hadn&#39;t turned 
she would never have tried to kill you, I&#39;m sure, she&#39;s not that kind of
person.&quot; 

&quot;WHAT!?&quot; Mary cried sounding surprised. &quot;So you&#39;re saying she didn&#39;t 
MEAN to bring a frigging... HAND-CANNON with her and shooting my whole 
kitchen to BLOODY pieces!? And that when she trashed my entire apartment
that just HAPPENED to be a mistake from her side???&quot; 

&quot;She used a gun?&quot; Mai asked in confusion. That&#39;s strange, she would 
never...&quot; Mai really was surprised. Leona had told her that she despised
the thought of using firearms. &quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s cheap and cowardly, guns should not determine a clean fight&quot; she 
had said. 

&quot;I&#39;ve had enough of this! I&#39;m going to talk to her and then...&quot; Mai 
grabbed her as Mary was about to stand up again. Ibuki quickly stood up 
in front of the door to hinder any means of escape. 

&quot;No don&#39;t! She is injured real badly! If you hurt her more she could 
die, please Mary stop it!&quot; 

The bounty hunter hesitated for a moment, did she say &quot;die&quot;? 

&quot;You were more lucky than she was... You don&#39;t know how many cuts and 
blows she took to... save... to... it... &quot; Mai tried to think of 
anything other 
than how to explain Leona protecting &quot;her&quot;. 

&quot;She protected this girl, she was about to sacrifice her own life just 
to make her get away...&quot; 

&quot;Girl? You mean that one in the room next to her.&quot; Mary seemed to calm 
down. 

&quot;No, that&#39;s Whip. One of Leona&#39;s friends. I never saw the one she 
protected clearly, she reminded somewhat of... me...&quot; 

&quot;NOT good enough!&quot; Mary cried and threw herself at the door. Ibuki was 
already there however but she received punch against her head. She 
swiftly blocked this but she was struck by Mary&#39;s elbow a second later. 
Ibuki went down under the blow and lifted her hands to her face. 

&quot;Ibuki!? Are you okay???&quot; Mai asked worriedly. 

&quot;I&#39;m FINE! snf... she just gave me a nose-bleed, you have to hurry, I&#39;ll
come right after.&quot; Mai nodded and hurried after the furious bounty 
hunter. 

&quot;Leona! Just you wait!&quot; Mary thought while kicking the door in. The girl
that sat next to the military woman gasped and turned around. 

&quot;NO! Don&#39;t hurt Leona!&quot; She cried and stood up. 

&quot;Move out of the way silly girl, I&#39;ll teach that Leona of yours not to 
mess with me!&quot; 

&quot;No! Y-yyou ww... Y-you would have to get past me first!&quot; She stood up 
and 
moved into Mary&#39;s path. Was she serious? Was she crazy? 

&quot;Don&#39;t do this you fool!&quot; Mary quickly turned to lock the door. She 
grabbed the girl and looked at her. She was a cute and probably teenaged
girl smaller and obviously weaker than herself. What was she doing in a 
military uniform anyway? Mary pushed her out of the way and jumped up 
the bed were Leona was sleeping. 

&quot;Now, you seem quite injured, and sleepy, so much the better!&quot; 

Whip was panicking, she had to do something quick or else she would 
loose her savior. She quickly grabbed her bag and quickly poured out the
things in it on the floor. 

&quot;AHHH!!! What the hell!?&quot; She turned around and faced the girl again. 
She had a whip rolled into her hands and she looked really nervous. 

&quot;You... you... let her go... you meanie!&quot; Mary laughed at this seemingly
empty threat. 

&quot;Meanie? Didn&#39;t I tell you to STAY OUT OF THIS!?&quot; She slapped Leona&#39;s 
cheek with her palm. 

&quot;You think you can stop me?&quot; The girl swallowed and lifted the whip. 

&quot;You leave her alone! Or else I&#39;ll... just... just... leave her... 
please?&quot; Mary felt affected by this. What was with this girl, who was 
she? Before she could finish her thoughts though Mai blew the door open.
Ibuki swiftly ran into the room and jump-kicked the blonde out of the 
bed with a sweeping motion. She then wrestled Mary to the ground and 
looked at her with cold eyes. 

&quot;You! You... I...&quot; Mary couldn&#39;t summon enough anger any more. She was 
tired and her adrenaline was thinning out. She struggled at first but 
she gave it up as Mai confronted her. She was carried out of the room 
and into Ibuki&#39;s bedroom on the other side of the building. Whip checked
up on Leona and then followed, she wanted to know more about this 
attacker. 

&quot;That was stupid! Don&#39;t you realize... You did the very same thing you 
said she tried doing to you! Do you still feel you have a right to kill 
her ne?&quot; Mary stayed quiet. She wanted to pay back what Leona did to 
her, but with her in that state and with all their common friends it was
hard. She snarled and relaxed under Ibuki&#39;s grip. 

&quot;I think we should forget about this stupid dispute. Let&#39;s settle it 
right now, and here! What was this quarrel about anyway?&quot; Mai looked 
seriously at her. 

&quot;Just as you wouldn&#39;t know. Are you emotionally blind!?&quot; Mary thought. 
She turned her head and looked away from the kunoichi. 

&quot;What&#39;s your name again?&quot; Whip asked. 

&quot;Blue Mary! And don&#39;t you forget that one girl. I might be coming for 
ya!&quot; 

&quot;Hey, that&#39;s not a...&quot; 

&quot;Let her go Ibuki, you&#39;ve done great, now if you&#39;ll excuse us. And bring
Whip with you. Whip I am sorry for my friend&#39;s behavior. I&#39;ll sort this 
out and we&#39;ll talk later.&quot; 

&quot;Hai!&quot; Ibuki loosened her grip and Mary quickly pulled her hands away 
and sat up. Ibuki grabbed the girl and assured her that nothing would 
happen. 

&quot;Mai is here, and she won&#39;t let Mary kill Leona-san. You want some 
ice-cream?&quot; 

Whip looked strangely at her as she said this. Ice cream? &quot;Well, that&#39;d 
be good, I guess...&quot; 

&quot;Great! Right this way my dear lady.&quot; Ibuki said as she led the girl out
of the room and into the corridor. 

&quot;Which flavor do you prefer? I bet you like lemon?&quot; 

&quot;Chocolate!&quot; 

&quot;Of course!&quot; Ibuki closed the door and Mai was left with Mary and an 
unconscious Leona. 

&quot;Well?&quot; Mai said breaking the silence. 

&quot;Well what? There&#39;s nothing to talk about.&quot; Mary said with an irritated 
voice. 

&quot;No? Then why this fighting? I don&#39;t get it. You never had a reason to 
hate each other and all of the sudden you go on a killing spree and try 
to finish each other off.&quot; 

&quot;HEY! I wasn&#39;t the one who started it!&quot; Mary said loudly. &quot;SHE came to 
MY apartment. SHE blew it to pieces and tried to kill ME, and on top of 
THAT she kidnapped you and did god knows what while I was gone! You tell
me that I have NO REASON to dislike her!?&quot; 

&quot;It wasn&#39;t like that, she just... We have to find out why she did that. 
Didn&#39;t she tell you anything, she must&#39;ve had some reason to do 
something like that she is such a controlled...&quot; 

&quot;I know!&quot; 

&quot;But then what!?&quot; 

&quot;You!&quot; Mary turned her gaze away from Mai to hide her expression. 

&quot;What?&quot; Mai asked startled. 

&quot;You! She was jealous of me being with you...&quot; 

&quot;WHAT!? That can&#39;t be...&quot; 

&quot;Well, she said so. And then she started shooting.&quot; 

&quot;But... But that doesn&#39;t make sense! Why would she...&quot; 

&quot;You remember yesterday morning?&quot; 

&quot;Nani? Well I do, but what do you know about that...&quot; 

&quot;You know! We had this conversation.&quot; 

&quot;What are you talking about. I was...&quot; 

&quot;You don&#39;t remember??? Come on! It was yesterday dammit! I said 
something mean about Andy and you got really upset. We talked about it 
and watched a movie.&quot; Mai was getting confused. She was sparring with 
Andy. Was Mary delirious? 

&quot;I was with Andy the whole day and...&quot; 

&quot;ANDY!?&quot; Mary almost screamed. &quot;You&#39;re still with him!? You told me he 
didn&#39;t mean ANYTHING to you!&quot; 

This shocked the kunoichi who was caught off guard. She was really 
considering whether Mary had gotten insane or if she was just incredibly
tired from all her fights. &quot;WHAT!?&quot; She WAS sparring with Andy. Mary 
hadn&#39;t called since they met in the cafeteria. Surely she would remember
her being with Mary. &quot;This is too weird!&quot; She said. 

&quot;OH YEAH!? Not a little appropriate... AMNESIA there!?&quot; 

&quot;What are you talking abo...&quot; 

&quot;You know DAMN WELL what I mean!&quot; 

&quot;No I DON&#39;T&quot; The kunoichi was getting frustrated as well as desperate. 
Mary was acting like a complete lunatic. What was this, why did Mary 
seem so hostile all of the sudden? And what would these accusations be 
good for? 

&quot;HEY! I KNOW what I heard!&quot; Mary said abruptly. &quot;You&#39;re getting second 
thoughts RIGHT!? Maybe you don&#39;t WANT to leave Andy!&quot; 

&quot;Mary! What do you think...&quot; 

&quot;THAT&#39;S the TRUTH, right?&quot; Mary&#39;s blood was boiling, she didn&#39;t think 
anymore. Black, black jealousy had engulfed her mind long ago. 

&quot;Stop it!&quot; Mai pleaded, she was too confused and she felt enormously 
pressured by Mary&#39;s presence. &quot;This is not the time!&quot; 

&quot;THAT&#39;S what I told YOU when you kept telling ME to SHUT UP! Of course, 
ME asking YOU to leave your little childhood SWEETHEART was too much!!!&quot;

&quot;STOP IT! I MEAN IT!&quot; Mai couldn&#39;t handle this. She was both loosing her
calm and as it seemed her dearest friend. She could only hope that 
Mary&#39;s irrational behavior had to with extreme lack of sleep or 
something in that category. 

&quot;I ASKED you! But NOOO!!! You wanted to keep me as YOUR LITTLE PET that 
you could use WHENEVER YOU FELT LIKE IT!!!&quot; 

&quot;STOP! PLEASE STOP! Its not like that! I am telling you! Just CALM down,
PLEASE!&quot; Mai cried at the top of her lounges but it didn&#39;t seem to help.

&quot;RIGHT THEN! Who&#39;s it gonna be!? HIM, OR ME!&quot; Mary grabbed Mai and gave 
her a cold look. 

&quot;Mary don&#39;t do this! Not now!&quot; Mai felt tears down her cheeks. This had 
to be the most horrible moment in her entire life. She felt so guilty in
loving another one, beside HIM. She couldn&#39;t help it, and yet it hurt 
her so badly. And before she had got the slightest chance to verify her 
feelings Mary came along with all kinds of crazy presumptions and gave 
her an ultimatum. 

&quot;I LOVE YOU MAI!&quot; Mary shrugged as the words left her lips. She wasn&#39;t 
going to stop now however. &quot;Please tell me I&#39;m right! I love you and I 
want to tell the world. I love you and I don&#39;t care what he says! PLEASE
say you love me too! TELL ME I&#39;m not wrong! I don&#39;t care what you did or
will do, just tell me that I&#39;M NOT WRONG!&quot; Mary grabbed Mary cheek and 
looked at her. Burning eyes, filled with agony, filled with fear, but 
mostly with hope. Mai gasped and stumbled as she tried to make out the 
words. 

&quot;Please Mai, think of all this we can share. I promise we&#39;ll sort this 
out and I won&#39;t ask anything more from you ever again. Please! At least 
say you might consider it.&quot; 

&quot;I... can&#39;t... leave... ah... Andy... I love him too much... you are 
acting like you&#39;re crazy... I&#39;m sorry... so sorry... &quot; Mai couldn&#39;t say 
anything else. 

Mary&#39;s eyes widened in shock. Her face went pale and her hand slowly 
left Mai&#39;s cheek. Mai tried to back off as she closed her eyes to await 
the response. 

This couldn&#39;t be true! All that emotion wasted on one person. How was 
she ever going to be able to repair this? Mary&#39;s breathing was ragged 
and she felt her heart beating at increasing rate. This wasn&#39;t 
happening! This was not true! It couldn&#39;t be! Yesterday... It was so 
real she could touch it... Why... Yesterday... It was so fine... she was
so happy. It had all been thrown away like garbage in the matter of 3 
seconds. EVERYTHING she had ever hoped for was gone, taken away from her
without remorse. 

&quot;You! You... you fucking bitch!&quot; Mary screamed and she slapped Mai&#39;s 
cheek. Mai didn&#39;t even try to avoid it and it hit her hard. Mai&#39;s body 
bent slightly covered the red cheek with her hand. 

&quot;Low-life dirt-eating creep!&quot; Mary grabbed the kunoichi&#39;s hair and 
pulled until it hurt. She pulled Mai closer and yelled right into her 
face. &quot;If I ever see you again! If I EVER... I&#39;ll KILL you! I NEVER want
to see you again! You understand, if you will not move away I WILL!!! 
You... We are not friends as of today! You HEAR ME! I HATE YOU!!!&quot; She 
spat in Mai&#39;s face and pushed her aside. The blonde stormed through the 
door and ran along the corridor to the floor below. 

Mai fell to the ground with no strength to aid her anymore. Mary&#39;s slap 
didn&#39;t hurt half as much as her words. Mai stretched her hand as if to 
reach out for something, it shivered and there was nothing to grab. All 
her control was slipping away and Mai lost all common sense, she felt 
that she just wanted to perish right here and now. She couldn&#39;t however,
Andy was still here... 

&quot;GAAAAAHHHHH!!!&quot; 

Ibuki hurried back to Mai as she heard this and found her sitting on the
floor, tears running down her cheeks like a flood. She was a mere wreck 
of herself and kept weeping and mumbling with no sign of concern for the
smaller ninja&#39;s presence whatsoever. 

&quot;Why Mary? *sob* ... I can&#39;t help it... *sob* *sob*... come back Mary 
plehehease! Mmmmhhh!!!&quot; She moaned. &quot;Maaaryyy! *Sigh*... *sob*...&quot; 

Ibuki grabbed the kunoichi gently by her shoulders and tried to figure 
out what had happened. 

&quot;M-Mai... are you okay...?&quot; 

&quot;Let me GO!&quot; Mai cried and pushed Ibuki away. 

&quot;Sh... Should I go after her...? M-Mai?&quot; Ibuki tried in her friendliest 
voice. She couldn&#39;t stand this, there had to be something she could do. 

&quot;NO! She... she won&#39;t come back... leave me alone!&quot; 

&quot;But...&quot; 

&quot;I said LEAVE ME ALONE!&quot; 

&quot;Y-yes... right away!&quot; Ibuki quickly left the room confused by Mai&#39;s 
sudden rudeness, she wasn&#39;t angry with her, right? 

*** 

&quot;DAMN!!!&quot; Mary forced all her power into the wall as her fist struck the
solid surface. 

&quot;DAMN! DAMN! DAMN! FUCK! SHIT! DAMN!&quot; She hammered against the wall 
until she was too tired to lift her arm. She bent her arm against the 
wall and pushed her head against it. She felt weak. So weak. Why!? She 
asked herself, over and over. Why was Mai so mean to her? Why this? She 
couldn&#39;t help her tears running. She was so mad. She felt so hopelessly 
weak. 

Maybe she should have stayed with Terry. At least he always came back to
her. He was nice, and a good fighter. He used to take them to all kinds 
of fun places and they used to have such a great time. She didn&#39;t love 
him however, she loved Mai. Mary hissed loudly as she grasped her chest 
as if to tear her aching heart out to make it stop. She could go home, 
go home and forget this. Wait for Terry and... she cried again... her 
mind was burning and she banged her head into the wall in hopes of 
rendering herself unconscious. It didn&#39;t help however, she couldn&#39;t hit 
herself hard enough. 

Dark Mai finally found her. She could see the blonde thrusting her head 
into the wall and gasped. Why was Mary hurting herself??? 

&quot;Oh no! Don&#39;t!&quot; She hurried and grabbed the bounty hunter from behind 
and tried to make her stop. &quot;Please stop, don&#39;t hurt yourself anymore, 
I&#39;m here... calm down... I won&#39;t leave you!&quot; 

Mary gasped as she could feel the hands around her. Mixed feelings, 
hatred and love. Anger and sorrow. She turned around and faced what 
looked like Mai. 

&quot;I told you to stay away! Don&#39;t torment me! Let me go, I want to go 
home... *sob*... please...&quot; 

Dark Mai looked at her lovingly and it didn&#39;t seem like she intended to 
let Mary go. 

&quot;Let me... *sob*... go... I don&#39;t want you...&quot; She continued weeping and
Dark Mai found it unpleasant. She decided to end it, once and for all. 

&quot;Mary... look at me!&quot; Mary reluctantly did as the mimic said. Her cheeks
where wet with tears and Dark Mai felt sorry for what she had done to 
her. She did her best to dry the tears away and to make Mary notice the 
changes in her. 

&quot;Mai... You are not wearing the same clothes, right?&quot; The bounty hunter 
said after a while. Not that she hadn&#39;t seen Mai change clothes in about
&amp;frac12; second but this was different somehow. 

&quot;Right!&quot; Dark Mai replied while she continued brushing the tears off 
Mary&#39;s face. 

&quot;And you... you had red-like hair right?&quot; 

&quot;No.&quot; 

This was weird, Mary had not noticed the change in the hair before and 
now that she thought about it Mai did not often dye her hair, what was 
even weirder was that she remembered Mai having it like this the day 
before but not 20 minutes ago. 

&quot;You&#39;re not Mai?&quot; Mary asked. She was really tired and so emotionally 
exhausted that she wasn&#39;t even shocked as she realized something was 
VERY different. 

&quot;No.&quot; Dark Mai replied and dried off the last tear and tasted it. 

&quot;What are you?&quot; Mary asked with a low voice. She couldn&#39;t summon enough 
power to make a feeling as it was right now. 

&quot;I am... a, eh, well... a *mimic* should do.&quot; Dark Mai pronounced the 
word low as if she was ashamed of it. 

&quot;A... mimic?&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s your name then?&quot; Mary was too tired to care and didn&#39;t find this
to be really strange, she didn&#39;t have the strength to reflect over the 
situation. 

&quot;Hm, I&#39;d prefer if you called me *Dark* Mai.&quot; 

&quot;Why?&quot; 

&quot;Cuz... I&#39;m not THE Mai.&quot; Mary thought this over for a minute. What the 
hell was this? 

&quot;THE Mai?&quot; She asked. 

&quot;The one that you just had a fight with upstairs.&quot; Dark Mai said and 
smirked. Mary was really confused now. But the mimic seemed calm and she
was too, for some reason. 

&quot;And you are?&quot; 

&quot;The who told you she loved you the other day.&quot; The mimic replied 
calmly. 

&quot;That&#39;s why...&quot; 

&quot;Mai didn&#39;t remember. That is correct, good girl!&quot; 

&quot;Hm, thanks, I guess. What are you doing?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m trying to be your girlfriend.&quot; 

&quot;My what?&quot; 

&quot;Your girlfriend. I really like you, and I really hate Andy.&quot; This 
sounded to good to be true and Mary nearly fainted. Both from exhaustion
but also because the late shock she should&#39;ve received two minutes ago. 

&quot;Woooh! Don&#39;t faint on me.&quot; Dark Mai caught the bounty hunter and pulled
her close. 

&quot;Why? Why this?&quot; Mary asked weakly. 

&quot;Because I WANT you. I NEED you. Everything I said to you yesterday is 
true. I could fight a war for you if it would make you happy.&quot; Dark Mai 
tried hard not to begin messing with Mary&#39;s mind. She would fight this 
one fairly. 

&quot;You would?&quot; 

&quot;Yes! I would do anything to make you happy!&quot; 

&quot;Yeah?&quot; 

&quot;Hm. Try me!&quot; 

&quot;Okay. Go steal a tank and blow this building up.&quot; Mary said and tried 
to get loose from the grip. 

&quot;Its sad, but if it&#39;ll make you happy I&#39;ll do that for you.&quot; The mimic 
said and went down the hall. 

&quot;Hey wait! I was just kidding!&quot; 

&quot;What? You don&#39;t want me to?&quot; 

&quot;NO!&quot; 

&quot;Okay!&quot; The mimic sounded happy and wasted no time in getting back to 
hugging her lovely friend. 

&quot;This is too frigging weird!&quot; Mary thought. Yet she felt very secure in 
the mimic&#39;s arms. 

&quot;This is not weird. I care for you, more than anything. Am I weird for 
that. Am I weird because I tried with all my might to get the one thing 
I desire in this world.&quot; Dark Mai moved her lips closer to Mary&#39;s and 
they brushed against each other. &quot;Am I weird for treasuring you than my 
own life?&quot; Mary couldn&#39;t say that this didn&#39;t have any effect on her. In
fact she was feeling better already with this option. It still seemed 
like a dream however. 

&quot;I am not dreaming...?&quot; 

&quot;No, I am here. I am here for you only.&quot; 

&quot;I can&#39;t believe this. It seems so unreal. Give me a slap so that I will
wake up.&quot; 

&quot;But... You are not dreaming...&quot; 

&quot;Sure... C&#39;mon, a really hard one to clear my mind... heh heh, haha ha 
ha!&quot; Mary turned her head. 

&quot;Uh... Mary... Are you sure this is a good idea?&quot; The bounty was too 
convinced that she must&#39;ve hit her head too hard against the wall 
though. She kept laughing and it looked like she was going insane. &quot;This
would be what they call a traumatic effect I guess.&quot; The mimic thought. 

&quot;Well... if that is what you want...&quot; Mary looked at her with turbid 
eyes and seemed rather dizzy from the excitement. &quot;&#39;sigh...&quot; Dark Mai 
stretched back and slapped Mary with full strength to hopefully make her
snap out of it. The blow sent Mary diving into the floor and she turned 
180 degrees from the force. 

&quot;OH MY GOD, MARY ARE YOU OKAY???&quot; Dark Mai immediately crouched to 
examine her. Maybe she had hit too hard. 

&quot;Mary, Mary talk to me!&quot; 

&quot;Oww... Christ! You sure know how to deal punches alright.&quot; Mary moaned 
and turned to her back. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I am so sorry... I didn&#39;t think it would be that bad...&quot; 

Mary shook her head however. &quot;Its okay... I believe you, but we should 
talk this over however...&quot; 

&quot;I agree. I&#39;ll tell you whatever you want to know.&quot; Dark Mai replied and
smiled as she helped Mary up. 

&quot;Good, and promise me one thing...&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t EVER do that again.&quot; 

&quot;Ah, yes... I&#39;m sorry...&quot;
