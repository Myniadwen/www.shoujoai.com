<h1>For the Love of Mary Blue (part 1 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kfighters/index.html">King of Fighters</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hexelf.html">Hex Elf</a><br> </h2>
<pre>*** Outside Pao Pao cafe&#39; at 3:17 pm, Friday. 

&quot;Doshta? Dan, Dai jo bu?&quot; (What&#39;s wrong? Dan, are you okay?) Mary said 
sarcastically while Dan was floored after she had swept him of his 
feet. The fight had not gone very far but Mary was already sure she 
would beat this Dan to a pulp in seconds. Behind the Pao Pao cafe&#39; at 
the beach the final battle in the small but famous &quot;Javelin&quot; 
tournament took place. There were few spectators now but as the fight 
progressed, a seemingly never-ending stream of new ones appeared.

&quot;You shall regret those words!&quot; Dan said as he run forward and 
attempted the sweep her. Mary jumped his sweep but suddenly Dan 
shouted. &quot;Dan!&quot; (Of course as any real SF player would know, he made a 
sweep-into-Dan kick move.) Mary was caught off guard by Dan&#39;s sudden 
attack, as the Saikyo warrior came flying with a knee after trying to 
sweep her she didn&#39;t have time to block his knee. It hit her in the 
side and Mary was nearly knocked down. 

&quot;Dan!&quot; Dan cried out again as he turned around in mid air and 
delivered another spinning kick, this time Mary was hit in the belly 
and she lost her breath. 

&quot;Dan, hiya!&quot; The third kick came a bit lower but Dan aimed upwards 
during the spin to aim for the head, however Mary managed to block 
this. Grabbing his leg Mary slammed him into the floor behind her. 

&quot;Hmm, maybe you aren&#39;t as weak as they said.&quot; Mary said with some hard 
breathing. Her belly hurt as she tried to move. Dan said nothing, he 
just went back to his usual, and very odd, stance. The bounty hunter 
then noticed him making his eyebrow thing. 

&quot;Don&#39;t be mean, here I come!&quot; Mary jumped and spun trough the airs 
attempting to knock Dan&#39;s head with her heel. Missing partly because 
her side hurt too much, she hit his shoulder and using the opportunity 
she tried to flip him sideways into the floor again. 

&quot;Ping-ping!&quot; The blonde cried as she got his head between her knees. 
Dan tripped and fell as he lost his balance and smashed his head into 
the ground. Mary pulled him sideways all the way down and landing on 
top of him on her knees she punched him between his shoulders. The 
Saikyo warrior would have a hard time getting up, as a result of him 
getting dumb ideas. Dan screamed and lay still as Mary stood up. 

The crowd went wild as she made her gun motion at the lying Saikyo 
warrior. The blonde believing she had won began to walk away from the 
wounded Dan but soon she heard his voice. 

&quot;H-hey Blue, we.... We&#39;re not done yet!&quot; 

&quot;...huh...&quot; She grumbled. 

Dan stood up and laughed. &quot;You thought a Saikyo warrior would just lay 
down after such a weak blow.&quot; 

Mary snickered as she saw Dan having a hard time standing straight and 
constantly patting his head. &quot;Good Dan, now you fight me for real?&quot; 
She said with a wide smile. &quot;Maybe those blows cleared you head a 
little ne? Come on pink boy; show me... well, whatever it is you can 
do.&quot; 

&quot;You bet I will!&quot; Dan rushed against Mary and lashed several punches 
against her. Dodging the three first; the bounty hunter tried to sweep 
him; however Dan jumped and kicked in the air. Mary, although a little 
confused by the lack of hits, saw that coming and sidestepped. When 
the Saikyo warrior landed she punched at him from the side but missed 
as he dodged and rolled backwards. 

&quot;Doshta doshta!&quot; He shouted. Mary, a bit distracted at first, rushed 
against him but was cut off by a new move from Dan&#39;s mysterious Saikyo 
style. &quot;Gadouken!&quot; She tried to block it as she&#39;d heard of the power 
of the Shotokan style fireball that could travel great distances. 

Mary was quite surprised though as nothing struck her. (Dan&#39;s 
&quot;fireball&quot; was another story.) &quot;Huh?&quot; Mary lowered her guard, too late 
realizing that Dan was going for another punch, this time from right 
in front of her. 

&quot;Hey that&#39;s not... ugh!&quot; She screamed. Dan cried out as he slammed the 
bounty hunter to the ground with a powerful over-head blow. 

&quot;You... you...&quot; Mary was red with anger as she stood up directly 
after. Still feeling the agony of the blow she gritted her teeth. 
Never before had she been tricked by such a worthless move. 

Dan moved to his side and easily dodged the raging Mary when she came 
running towards him. As she went past him with a furious kick he 
punched her in the side and grabbed the blonde by the neck and held 
her head down. 

&quot;Sorry, Mary...&quot; He punched her in the face several times from 
underneath and it flashed before Mary&#39;s eyes as she got struck. The 
hits leaving her dizzy made Dan go for another. 

&quot;... for not being a gentleman...&quot; He punched the blonde in her 
stomach and this time she was struck breathless for a long time. 

&quot;... I&#39;m really a nice guy...&quot; Dan said and grabbed her hair and 
lifted the bounty hunter up again. 

&quot;...but I WILL win this tournament!&quot; He spun quickly as he went for a 
finishing roundhouse, but as he was about to hit Mary she fell 
backwards and rolled to a very low stance. Dan nearly losing his 
balance after his missed opportunity quickly got back to his stance 
again. But only seconds later he rushed forward. 

&quot;Ashi-ora, ora ora ora ora ora ora!&quot; (He&#39;s doing the &quot;Hissou Burai 
Ken&quot;.) Dan lashed several kicks and punches, some to fast for Mary to 
block, but as he was trying to dragon punch her the bounty hunter 
rolled to the side and welcomed the falling Dan with one of her own 
moves. 

&quot;Giant swing!&quot; She grabbed Dan from behind, slammed him into the floor 
once, twice and then stood up and began swinging him around with 
blinding speed. &quot;With my swing I&#39;ll pretty soon, send Dan on trip to 
the very moon! Hiyaaa!&quot; Mary sang and then let him go, hurdling him 
into a nearby wall. 

&quot;B-baka... na... Uhhhh...&quot; Dan collapsed as he landed. 

&quot;Ora ora!&quot; Mary shouted as she engulfed the audience&#39;s cheers, 
stretching her hands into the air. &quot;I did it, oh yeah, oh yeah! Damn 
I&#39;m good.&quot; But as she looked trough the crowd she couldn&#39;t see any of 
her friends she was supposed to celebrate with after the fight. How 
could they NOT? At least Terry or Joe would realize how important this 
was to her. Did they forget? 

The bounty hunter started looking around and asking for Terry. But 
after a long search Mary ended up both puzzled and depressed as she 
realized there weren&#39;t anyone waiting for her. After collecting the 
prize money for the fight she went to find a payphone. 

When Mary got there she put some coins in to the slot and began to 
dial Terry&#39;s number to ask where he was. &quot;555-420... Damn!&quot; But she 
just couldn&#39;t forgive him not being there. &quot;Baka... I&#39;ll call Mai 
instead, at least she knows how to have fun... He can sit there and 
wait for me!&quot; 

She hung up the phone and put some more coins into the slot. She 
punched her friend&#39;s numbers and hoped that Mai would be home. 

&quot;Moshi moshi?&quot; A familiar voice said. 

&quot;Mai, hi! I, well, I... won the fight today... and...&quot; 

&quot;You did!? That&#39;s wonderful!&quot; 

&quot;H-hey Zeniorita! Did ye ever doubt my maaad skillz?&quot; Mary said with a 
funny voice trying to forget how disappointed she was. 

&quot;What, really? I&#39;ve heard he was supposed to be very strong.&quot; Mai said 
while giggling a little. 

&quot;Okay, okay maybe not ALL that weak, but he got his buns kicked 
alright!&quot; 

&quot;Mary I&#39;m sure it was great. And I have something to tell you, I&#39;ve 
checked you rankings and you have won your 100th fight today!&quot; Mai 
said. 

&quot;Yes I know, so where&#39;s Terry in that case! He should be here greeting 
me!&quot; Mary said with in a strong voice. It was obvious that she was 
upset.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry Mary-san. But I am sure he must be somewhere around, 
are you sure you checked...&quot; Mai paused as she could hear a slight 
sigh from Mary. &quot;That bad is it?&quot; She said. 

&quot;Mmm-what? Oh, sorry... it&#39;s just... I&#39;m so happy and no one&#39;s here to 
share it with me... Terry you bastard...&quot; Mary&#39;s voice shivered a bit. 
She didn&#39;t like him all that much, but Mary knew no other that cared 
for her, like he did. And right now she needed one who did. Winning 
without friends to remind her was no victory at all she thought. 
Especially since it was her 100th. 

&quot;Oh Mary-chan...&quot; Mai said trying to think of something to cheer the 
bounty hunter up.

&quot;But, hey. Why don&#39;t you and I and do something together. We can go 
dancing and have fun for ourselves right? Andy&#39;s away training so I&#39;m 
all alone during this weekend.&quot; Mary was surprised by the kunoichi&#39;s 
proposition. 

&quot;You, would want that?&quot; She asked, a bit curious. 

&quot;Sure, as long as I get the first dance with you.&quot; Mary blushed as she 
heard the kunoichi&#39;s somewhat weird demand. Then she came to think 
about Terry. 

&quot;Alright, my dear.&quot; She said with a seductive voice. It could be a 
great time, and it wasn&#39;t like it would be the first time she and the 
kunoichi had hit on each other for fun. &quot;I&#39;ll pick you up in, say...&quot; 
Mary looked at her watch, it was about 4 PM. &quot;... two hours? Is that 
okay? I bet the clubs aren&#39;t open before that.&quot; 

&quot;Fine! And don&#39;t forget!&quot; Mai said sounding very happy. 

&quot;I won&#39;t.&quot; Mary hung up the phone and collected the remaining change. 
She slid the door open and was on her way home. As she got to her car, 
a small dimensional rift opened not very far from the payphone cell, 
Mary didn&#39;t notice though. She thought of what clothes she would wear. 

And was she really to, well, DATE Mai? It sure looked that way, and 
after all Mary once had a fantasy about Mai and her being together. 
&quot;Maybe, it would be... Oh well. &quot; 

Mary put the keys in and her Ferrari started with a satisfying roar. 

&quot;Now hon, are you feeling alright? You haven&#39;t been feeling lonely? 
No? Are you going to take Mary home then?&quot; Mary said while petting her 
cars outer steel. &quot;Of course you will.&quot; She said while pressing the 
gas pedal to the bottom. And with another roar the car&#39;s wheels spun 
through the sand as if on ice when Mary put in the first gear. 

From the dimensional rift a scream could be heard, not very loud, but 
still as strong as a thousand souls crying as if falling to a certain 
death. Out of the rift came a woman dressed in the darkest of blue, 
carrying two fans in her hands. She hit the ground hard and rolled 
several yards away from the dimensional portal. 

As she landed a gigantic hand made out of steel and bolts appeared 
from the open space and tried to grab her. The rift soon shut in an 
instant however, just barely not cutting the hand off with it. 

The mystery woman stood up and looked around her. Feeling somewhat 
dizzy she placed a hand to her head. 

&quot;This is not the place I&#39;m supposed to have landed in. But it looks 
like it indeed, very much like it.&quot; It was Dark Mai, created from the 
bloodstain of a Mai from a different reality. She had been hunted down 
by one of Jin&#39;s (See FGLMM part 1: Kakugo Jin) executioner-bots for 
interfering with his tournament. But with most of her energy charged 
Dark Mai managed to slip away into a dimensional rift created by her.

It had been very strenuous and the mimic was not certain if she had 
come close enough to her creator&#39;s reality. Dark Mai looked around and 
saw a familiar Ferrari driving off. Possessing a fogyy version of the 
real Mai&#39;s memory she recognized it as Blue Mary&#39;s. 

&quot;Damn I missed her... but if she&#39;s here then I should be close enough. 
That&#39;s good. Although, I will never catch her at that speed.&quot; The 
mimic thought. &quot;I will have to find them at their place.&quot; Dark Mai 
concentrated and looked for places where Mary and Mai could be. She 
had always had some trouble with this since it was stolen memories and 
not actually hers. 

A psychic mist was constantly there to dampen her mimicked mind. Dark 
Mai didn&#39;t really see it that way though, she HAD strong feelings for 
Mary and some for another one named Leona, just like her counterpart. 
She had had the same feelings for someone named Andy at first, but as 
she quickly recognized his as a hopeless idiot and erased him. She 
couldn&#39;t really figure out what the real Mai saw in the younger 
brother Bogard. Maybe that he was somewhat good looking and fought 
with some grace.

Anyway, now it was one of her top priorities to find the one called 
Blue Mary, or perhaps Leona. She would have to find them in order to 
refill her energy in the only way she was capable of; by seducing 
them. Dark Mai&#39;s energy was not critical but she knew it would be by 
the end of the day. And using any other person to refill it would feel 
like, well, cheating... 

She really was Mai after all, with some predatory, and Hentai, 
instincts. And of course with some memories and knowledge of her own. 
Several options appeared from the mist in Dark Mai&#39;s mind after a 
while. The mimic smiled and was on her way. 

*** Haneda airport, 5:30 PM. 

&quot;We hope you have enjoyed your trip and would wish you a nice day!&quot; 
The speakers said, although Leona did not listen. She didn&#39;t care for 
that matter. What would they know anyway? Anyone wishing 

Leona a good day would either be a person not knowing her at all or 
one being incredibly suicidal. They could have a nice day for 
themselves as far as she cared. The blue haired girl brushed of some 
dust from her suit and straightened her shorts; it had been a long 
trip. 

Leona had taken a week off so that she would have time to either be 
with her lover Iori, or her best friend Mai. She wanted to look up the 
kunoichi first since she would probably know where to find Iori. Leona 
looked in her pocket to pick up the note with the address. And... 

&quot;What!? Where the hell is it!?&quot; Leona thought. She dropped her bag and 
looked through all her pockets and the whole bag. 

&quot;Damn!&quot; She thought not finding it. &quot;That&#39;s just great! What the HELL 
am I going to do now?&quot; Leona tried to be calm and think, as she knew 
things where to go wrong if she lost control. 

&quot;Easy now Leona. You will probably not find it anyway, so it&#39;s no use 
thinking of where it could be. Where do you go then...?&quot; Leona 
remembered a club Mai talked about. It was one of her favorite places 
she thought. &quot;Of course, I will go there, and I think Iori liked that 
one too, maybe he&#39;s there.&quot; Leona picked up her bag and wandered 
trough the gates. 

*** 6:35 PM, in a Club called &quot;the Raven.&quot; 

&quot;May I have the first dance, me lady?&quot; Mary said with a soft voice 
taking Mai&#39;s hand. 

&quot;Sure, if you want to, my dear gentleman.&quot; The kunoichi answered. 

&quot;Madame...&quot; Mary said and kissed her hand and giggled as she did. Mary 
was wearing almost all black for her &quot;date&quot;. A pair of long and wide 
pants, a black tank top but white Adidas sports shoes. Simple, 
comfortable, and absolutely gorgeous Mai had thought, looking at the 
cut and loose waist on the pants. The cut going from the middle of 
Mary&#39;s waist and several centimeters down showing lots of panty and 
left very little for the kunoichi&#39;s imagination. 

&quot;Mai?&quot; Mary whispered while the couple where on their way to the dance 
floor. 

&quot;Yes my dear bounty hunter?&quot; 

&quot;I just wondered. Do--- do you care for me?&quot; 

&quot;Of course I do! You&#39;re my best friend!&quot; 

&quot;I know that... but... ah, never mind.&quot; Mary was fending her own 
feelings, she had always thought that Terry was the one for her, but 
now, she just didn&#39;t know. Maybe she had been wrong all this time and 
the one she REALLY wanted was closer than she thought. 

MAYBE she was just using Terry to get closer to the one his brother 
was... 

&quot;Damn! What the HELL am I thinking! What would Mai say if I told her! 
Geez Mary, now you should dance and have fun. You can think about that 
later.&quot; She took a good look at her current dancing partner to see if 
her thoughts really did have any explanation. Mai was wearing a blue 
dress with one side cut far up. (Like the one she wears in Real Bout.) 
It went down to just above her knees and she wore a belt to keep it 
up. Mary smiled when she noticed this, she never used a belt in that 
way. If her pants where loose then they would stay that way. 

Mai was also wearing a blue shirt resembling a gi, it was far too big 
but looked really nice on her. For shoes she wore sandals not covering 
very much of her feet. Strange clothing but very good looking still 
the same Mary thought. The colors of different shades of blue matched 
very nice with Mai. 

When the music started &quot;Going blind&quot; by Nine-inch nails blurted 

out of the speakers. 

&quot;Sorry that I couldn&#39;t pick you up Mai.&quot; Mary said while dancing. 

&quot;Oh, it was my fault you had to look me up in here. Ibuki needed help 
and it took me longer than I thought to cheer her up.&quot; Mai answered 
still keeping the rhythm. 

&quot;She was depressed?&quot; 

&quot;Uh, yes. Love trouble, you know in her age...&quot; Mai said thinking back 
to the first episode of the Ibuki&#39;s Gift series.

&quot;Anyone I know?&quot; Mary asked looking curious. 

&quot;I don&#39;t think so, anyway she was off to sort it out now. Don&#39;t worry 
about. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Mai said and grabbed Mary&#39;s sides. 

&quot;Okay!&quot; Mary said while blushing. Not very far from the couple a dark 
silhouette appeared from the shadows. It was Dark Mai that had been 
following Mary around, but she had lost her in the crowd. 

Too many young men were getting in her way. Maybe a long time ago, if 
she was desperate enough, she would have taken them instead but as 
things where now she wouldn&#39;t let them get between her and her prey. 
Now where was Mary and why would they not leave her alone, Dark Mai 
thought. 

&quot;Hey what do you want!?&quot; She shouted as another young man confronted 
her. 

&quot;I-I-I just wanted to know if you wanted to have a drink.&quot; He said. 
Dark Mai very frustrated came up with an idea. She looked around and 
saw a young woman sitting by herself in the bar. As she did she 
smiled. 

&quot;Sure!&quot; Dark Mai said and walked up to the girl. 

&quot;Bartender, this man is paying for our drinks. A Bloody Mary for me.&quot; 
She smiled at her own sarcasm. &quot;And a Gin &amp; Tonic for my friend here.&quot; 
Dark Mai said before asking her name.

&quot;Blame&#133; Specter, Blame&#133;&quot; The woman whispered.

&quot;Interesting name.&quot; Dark Mai whispered back and then suddenly grabbed 
the girl&#39;s head to kiss her passionately. The young man that had been 
watching nearly fainted as he saw this. 

&quot;Thank you honey! Now if you&#39;ll excuse me I have other business to 
attend.&quot; The mimic said as she let the girl go. 

&quot;S-Sure... &quot; The young woman answered while blushing heavily. Dark Mai 
quickly drunk up as the drink was served. Mimics had no problem with 
alcohol and Dark Mai barely felt the taste, she just drank it to look 
cool, and maybe scare off some more annoying boys. 

&quot;Maybe later?&quot; She said and patted the girl&#39;s chin. Girls WERE every 
bit more interesting prey than men. They could be brought to multiple 
orgasms, for more energy or for sheer ecstasy. They were more durable. 
Most men, even though not all that many, Dark Maihad used were so 
quick that she hadn&#39;t even the chance to get to work before they came. 
And of course girls were more fun. They were more challenging often 
not thinking of going to bed with another girl as an alternative to a 
great evening. Dark Mai found it a great pleasure in finding out what 
it took for one before doing something so &#39;hentai&#39;. 

(If you don&#39;t now the meaning of the word: Quit reading NOW! You 
probably didn&#39;t even knew what you were going into finding this page 
in the first place!) 

&quot;I&#39;d... like that.&quot; The girl said quietly. The mimic smiled and walked 
away, she was sure she knew the girl from somewhere but the mist in 
her mind made hard enough for her not to bother. Now where would she 
find Mary? Of course the dance floor! Mary would have got past the 
entrance and bar at this point. It was a bit crowded but since she 
made her scene it was easier for Dark Mai to get through, since most 
people moved out of the way. 

After a couple of minutes she found the spot where Mary was. Dark Mai 
got closer and got just behind the dancing blonde. It was almost too 
easy, Dark Mai thought. 

&quot;Only a bit closer, and then she&#39;s mine!&quot; But just as she was about to 
grab the woman she saw the real Mai coming. &quot;Oh&#133; damn it!&quot; The mimic 
thought and threw herself backwards so that she would hopefully not be 
seen. 

&quot;Damn!&quot; she thought again. &quot;How am I going to get her now. I am so 
empty that my body&#39;s feelings are twice as dominating. I have to get 
that girl!&quot; 

&quot;Hey, what do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot; A familiar voice said from 
underneath her. Dark Mai looked around her, Mary was now several yards 
from her. 

&quot;They move quick, lucky for me they look so occupied with each other 
that they won&#39;t notice me if I get away fast.&quot; Dark Mai thought. She 
was still afraid of her original from their last encounter.

&quot;Hey you, get off me!&quot; The voice said again. The mimic noticed that 
she was practically sitting on someone. She stood up slowly and looked 
away from the couple she had been studying. From under her another 
woman stood up. 

&quot;Just what do you think you&#39;re doing!&quot; Dark Mai felt a hand grabbing 
her shoulder as she was about to walk away. The mimic wouldn&#39;t have 
bothered normally but the voice sounded so familiar that she just had 
to take a look. Dark Mai turned around and then noticed Leona brushing 
her clothes of with one hand. 

&quot;M-Mai? It&#39;s you! Oh how happy I am to see you again!&quot; 

&quot;Hey!&quot; The mimic protested as Leona hugged her. 

&quot;But what where you doing jumping at people like that?&quot; Leona asked. 
&quot;You are not the clumsy type, you aren&#39;t drunk are you?&quot; 

Dark Mai thought about it a little, maybe it wasn&#39;t such a bad idea. 
Since her feelings for the military woman had been tripled due to the 
lack of energy after she landed the mimic&#39;s body almost screamed with 
lust. 

&quot;Ah, no I was pushed aside and I fell backwards since I couldn&#39;t... ah 
whatever. I am terribly sorry. I didn&#39;t hurt you did I?&quot; The mimic 
could see a small smile across Leona&#39;s lips, it looked almost as if 
she was about to burst out in laugh, but it quickly disappeared. 

&quot;No, of course not. I&#39;m just glad to find you. I managed to lose your 
address when I got here. Funny huh? But I managed to find you, this 
was your favorite club right?.&quot; Dark Mai thought about it for a while. 

&quot;Yes, glad you remembered!&quot; She said, as the mimic in fact did look 
for Mary in a club that Mai liked. Dark Mai thought about seducing 
Leona instead this time, since she would have no way in getting Mary 
for herself as things where now. She would have to be careful though, 
she remembered the strength of the real kunoichi. Dark Mai had 
underestimated her powers and will to live that time. But things were 
different now. Maybe they wouldn&#39;t even notice. 

&quot;I guess Leona will be first then.&quot; The mimic thought. &quot;But how am I 
going to do that? There are no drugs around and my charm spell are way 
too energy-draining for me now.&quot; The clone&#39;s gaze wandered over the 
crowd idly searching for an idea. Her quest ended when she looked at 
the bar. A small, but predatory, smile danced across her lips. 

&quot;Would you like to have a drink with me?&quot; Dark Mai then asked. 

&quot;Uh, I guess that&#39;d be okay...&quot; Leona said sounding a bit insecure. 
Dark Mai smiled widely and quickly pulled Leona with her. 

***Hotel Desert Flower, 11:30 PM. 

The door to Leona&#39;s apartment burst open as a pair of giggling young 
women tumbled into it. The black haired Mai barely caught herself, and 
Leona, and stumbled into the welcome arms of the couch. 

The two girls collapsed heavily still laughing and holding onto each 
other. Leona&#39;s eyes were half open, her body relaxed as she nestled 
against the kunoichi. Dark Mai smiled widely at the younger woman, her 
hunter&#39;s mind had decided now was the time to pounce. The mimic 
brought her hand to Leona&#39;s cheek and gently stroked it, the blue 
haired girl closing her eyes completely and sighing in contentment. 

&quot;Thank you Leona.&quot; Dark Mai said. &quot;That was so much fun!&quot; 

Leona grinned and opened her eyes foggily. She nodded and slumped 
against Mai even more. 

&quot;Yeah, I never did anything like that before, we&#39;ll have to do it 
again!&quot; 

&quot;Definitely!&quot; The mimic said intently, her eyes flashing with hunger. 
She slid down the couch until her face was level with her prey&#39;s. Her 
hand slid to the back of Leona&#39;s neck and resumed it&#39;s idle caresses. 
Leona met her gaze evenly, still smiling widely. 

&quot;You&#39;re so pretty Leona. Has anyone ever told you that?&quot; Dark Mai 
whispered huskily. Leona nodded once. 

&quot;Uh huh, Iori did. Last time I was her we met an&#39; we, well, we kinda, 
uh...&quot; The soldier girl trailed off her cheeks flushing in 
embarrassment. The mimic leaned forward until her breasts were 
pressing against Leona&#39;s. The blue haired young woman blushed even 
more but didn&#39;t shrink away. 

&quot;What Leona? What did Iori do to you?&quot; The girl mumbled something 
unintelligible and looked down, starting slightly as her gaze focused 
on the skin of the clone&#39;s breasts. Dark Mai wrapped her arms around 
Leona tightly and pressed her body fully against the younger girl&#39;s. 

&quot;Did he hold you like this?&quot; the mimic purred. Leona closed her eyes 
and nodded. Dark Mai touched her cheek to Leona&#39;s and whispered. &quot;Did 
he kiss you like this?&quot; With that Mai trailed butterfly light kisses 
from her prey&#39;s flushing alabaster cheeks to her small pouting lips. 
Then with no warning the mimic crushed Leona into a passionate kiss. 

Dark Mai flicked her tongue across the blue haired girls mouth until 
the younger girl&#39;s lips parted, then slipped it inside. Leona 
tentatively found Dark Mai&#39;s tongue with her own and began to kiss 
back. The mimic moved so she was on top of the younger woman and 
insinuated herself between the soldier girl&#39;s legs. Dark Mai writhed 
against Leona, need filling her stolen body with heat and taking 
pleasure both from the feel of the other girl beneath her and the 
energy she was gradually draining from the military girl. 

The mimic broke the kiss and began to lick and nibble the blue haired 
girl&#39;s neck, one hand pressing the soldier girl close, while the other 
undid the buttons of Leona&#39;s uniform. If the soldier girl remembered 
Dark Mai&#39;s question she didn&#39;t show it, she only moaned and gasped, 
her entire body shivering. 

Unconsciously Leona wrapped her arms around the mimic pulling her 
closer, crushing the kunoichi&#39;s expansive chest to her own. The black 
haired girl finally opened the last button of the girl&#39;s blouse and 
peeled it apart. Leona was wearing a white T-shirt beneath her 
uniform, the cotton virtually transparent with sweat now, revealing a 
cute little blue strapless bra beneath. 

The mimic made a sound half way between a purr and a growl and pressed 
her lips to Leona&#39;s. As the soldier girl, gasped at the passion of the 
kiss, Dark Mai slipped her hands to Leona&#39;s side and traced upward. 
The younger girl sighed and shifted slightly, her mind and heart full 
of Mai, and pleasure the kunoichi was giving her. 

The mimic rested her hands on the sides of Leona&#39;s pert breasts and 
ever so slowly traced her fingers to the peaks. Already hardened 
nipples were poking through both bra and shirt. The blue haired young 
woman gasped, and her back arched. The dark kunoichi grinned evilly 
then circled Leona&#39;s nipples playfully. The soldier girl&#39;s soft sighs 
became loud moans, and her subtle shifting upgraded into powerful 
writhing. The clone Mai had draw on all of her borrowed balance and 
skill to ride the smaller but stronger woman. 

Dark Mai grinned wider, she loved the game, the hunt, and yes the 
energy, but it was this, the command she received over her prey that 
was the true reward. Hunger however soon reminded her of a more 
important need. She halted her attention to Leona&#39;s nipples, the 
younger girl breathing a sigh of both relief and disappointment. 

The mimic reflected idly on how easy it was to take her copied 
clothing off. It was nearly a perfect form, she thought, and she 
wanted to keep it. With that the clone kunoichi undid her belt, and 
slipped out of her costume tossing it to the side carelessly. A growl 
of pure animalistic hunger escaped her lips as she paused and surveyed 
Leona&#39;s rising and falling chest. 

With no forewarning the mimic ripped Leona&#39;s shirt off, and moved the 
cups of the soldier girl&#39;s bra aside. Dark Mai pulled Leona into a 
fierce kiss, pressing her full, bouncy breasts against the younger 
girl&#39;s smaller firm ones. The blue haired girl wrapped her arms around 
the black haired woman and cried out into the kunoichi&#39;s mouth, 
sending shivers through the mimic. 

Frantically the clone sought out the clasp holding Leona&#39;s bra on then 
undid it. The mimic pulled away just long enough for the interfering 
material to fall away crushed their chests together again. 

Leona felt lost in a sea of heat and erotic sensation, her mind spun 
trying to grasp what was happening and only centering on Mai&#39;s lips, 
the feel of her smooth skin, and the smell of both of their sexes. She 
felt something building inside her, like waves crashing against a dam. 
Then she felt the kunoichi undo the 

button and zipper of her shorts. Her eyes flew open as the black 
haired girl on top of her continued the kiss, rubbing and writhing the 
peaks of their breasts together. 

Dark Mai felt the tongue of Leona against hers, the sweet, sweet taste 
of the younger girl filling her, both physically and on a different 
level. The more skin that touched, the more energy flowed from Leona 
to the mimic. The blue haired girl felt weak, out of control, a 
sensation so different to her normal existence that it was, exciting. 
The feeling inside her kept swelling, threatening to burst and send 
her over the edge at any time. 

That was when the Mai clone slipped her hand inside Leona&#39;s panties, 
her long fingers stroking the younger girl&#39;s trimmed sex. The blue 
haired girl spasmed, breaking the kiss unintentionally, all conscious 
thought lost, she only recognized need and passion. Dark Mai grinned, 
and rather than continue the kiss, she began licking the sides of the 
soldier girl&#39;s neck, the younger girl&#39;s moans and cries sending 
shivers down her spine. 

However, despite the fun she was having the mimic knew it was time to 
end this. The cloned kunoichi slid her index finger inside Leona&#39;s 
damp, and nearly burning hot sex. The soldier girl&#39;s writhing became 
so powerful that Dark Mai had to strain her superbly trained body to 
the limit to stay on top of the younger girl. The clone worked her 
finger back and forth, delighting in the sounds the blue haired girl 
was making. However as much pleasure as she was getting from the 
younger girl, the mimic wanted some for herself. 

Pausing in her stimulation of the military girl, Dark Mai used her 
free hand to slip out of her soaked panties. She then straddled 
Leona&#39;s smooth thigh, sighing with the sensation of her smooth, 
hairless sex against the other girl&#39;s skin. It was then that she heard 
something that gave her nearly as much pleasure. 

&quot;Mai, oh, Mai... please... don&#39;t... mmm... don&#39;t... stop...&quot; Leona 
gasped breathlessly. Dark Mai grinned and leaned down until her full 
lips were brushing the soldier girl&#39;s ear. 

&quot;You want me darling?&quot; the mimic asked, sliding her finger in and out 
of the girl&#39;s sex torturously slow. Leona gasped, and nodded 
desperately. 

The cloned kunoichi ran her tongue along the outside of the blue 
haired girl&#39;s ear, then added another finger to Leona&#39;s sex, while her 
thumb found the soldier girl&#39;s hardened clit. 

&quot;You want this?&quot; Dark Mai purred, slipping both fingers in and out of 
Leona&#39;s heat, while rubbing the hardened nub gently. The blue haired 
girl didn&#39;t answer, as she was too busy moaning and squirming. 

Because of the motion of the younger girl, the cloned kunoichi gasped 
as Leona&#39;s thigh slid back and forth across her sex. The mimic&#39;s 
control over the situation slipped away deliciously, as she lost 
herself to the moment just as Leona had some time ago. 

Both girls cried out, sensations sweeping them away like a waterfall. 
Without warning the dam burst for Leona. A flood of pleasure swept 
through her, lighting her blood on fire. The blue haired girl gave a 
long, quavering, scream of ecstasy then fell back limply. 

The mimic opened her eyes widely as energy exploded into her, 
amplified by the physical pleasure she received from 

Leona the cloned kunoichi came, shivering and shaking. She collapsed 
onto the blue haired girl&#39;s chest, a wide smile on her face. After she 
had some time to recover, the mimic looked up at Leona. The soldier 
girl&#39;s eyes were closed and her breathing was peaceful. 

Dark Mai still felt hunger gnawing at her however, both for more 
energy and for more pleasures. The mimic pulled her hand from the 
soldier girl&#39;s panties and licked her fingers clean, while pulling the 
shredded shirt from Leona&#39;s shoulders. 

&quot;Wake up darling.&quot; The mimic murmured. The younger girl shivered 
slightly and half opened her eyes, to see Mai leaning back against the 
arm of the couch, licking a finger of one hand while spreading the 
folds of her womanhood with the other. 

&quot;We&#39;re not quite done yet...&quot; Dark Mai purred. Leona&#39;s head was 
swimming, she felt out of control and confused, but that didn&#39;t stop 
her from crawling across the couch and lowering her lips to the 
kunoichi&#39;s sex. The mimic gasped and laced her fingers in the soldier 
girls blue hair. 

This was a VERY good night after all, she thought. 

*** The following day, Saturday, 11:15 am, Leona&#39;s residence at Hotel 
&quot;Desert Flower&quot;. 

Dark Mai awoke late, sighing and stretching, it had been a good hunt 
and although she didn&#39;t get what she&#39;d expected the mimic was happy. 
In front of her Leona lay silently, probably to wake up with an 
intense hangover from the day before. Dark Mai lay with her arms 
around the waist of the blue haired woman. All warm and with some 
sweat running down her back she carefully kissed Leona&#39;s neck. Leona 
suddenly fell to her back and slurred something about flowers and 
death in her sleep.

&quot;Don&#39;t you feel good?&quot; Dark Mai whispered in her ear and smiled as she 
heard the military girl softly taking the kunoichi&#39;s name to her lips.

&quot;Wake up my darling...&quot; Dark Mai said quietly while letting a finger 
run down Leona&#39;s face down to her belly.

&quot;Wake up and let me taste you once more...&quot; She circled the finger 
around Leona&#39;s belly thrice and then began moving further down. 

&quot;Wake up and show my how much you love me... Leona...&quot; As Dark Mai 
touched the outside of Leona&#39;s panties, which she had miraculously 
managed to keep on her throughout their session; Leona&#39;s eyes flew up.

&quot;M-Mai? What are you... oww my head.&quot; Leona quickly pulled away from 
the mimic but couldn&#39;t get out of the bed.

&quot;It&#39;s okay Leona. It&#39;s only a hangover. You are tougher than I 
thought.&quot; Dark Mai would have to make sure that she wouldn&#39;t lose her 
prey. She would have to make Leona think of her in a good and 
hopefully somewhat romantic way. So that she would be easy to seduce 
again if that would be necessary. 

&quot;I was worried I thought I might have met my match.&quot; Dark Mai lied. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; 

Leona didn&#39;t say anything, she didn&#39;t listen and she tried hard to 
remember what had happened to her last night. And WHY Mai was laying 
beside her in her bed? Leona sat at the end of it. 

&quot;Leona, you forgive me?&quot; Dark Mai said while slowly getting behind the 
military woman.

&quot;Leona...&quot; She whispered while slowly grabbing Leona&#39;s shoulders and 
began massaging them.

&quot;What... oww... what where we doing? Mai... my head hurts...&quot; 

&quot;Shhh... It will be fine...&quot; 

&quot;Mai... did... did we really...?&quot; Leona said with a low voice. 

Dark Mai didn&#39;t answer but continued to massage her. Slowly misty 
memories of the evening before came into Leona&#39;s mind. The blue haired 
woman was breathing hard at the thought but said nothing; instead she 
began putting on her clothes. The mimic could feel her muscles tighten 
under her hands.

Leona&#39;s head was full of questions. Mostly it was the question &quot;Why?&quot;. 
Was she really in love with the kunoichi? It had all happened so 
quickly and maybe it was a mistake. Yet Leona&#39;s feelings said 
something else. Her body longed for the touch of the kunoichi but 
Leona couldn&#39;t understand it. What could she do 

to be sure? She thought for a while, feeling the mimic&#39;s hands softly 
rubbing her shoulders all the time. 

&quot;Oh man... Should I really?&quot; Leona came to think at the wonderful 
moment when she and Mai for the first time had kissed, the first time 
she had felt their bodies against each other. She didn&#39;t remember much 
but the small things like the kisses and caressing was burnt into her 
mind. 

&quot;Man, oh man... what to do...&quot; Leona though when remembering how good 
it felt. &quot;Oh my... shit... Why am I thinking this? I should be 
punished for my careless act... It has only happened once... I was 
drunk... It has only happened this once... I was drunk...only once... 
and yet I am thinking about her as I had been in love with her for 
years...&quot; Thought struck Leona once again. &quot;Maybe I have been!&quot; 

*** Meanwhile in Mai&#39;s apartment. 

Mary woke up from the smell of cooked food. She found herself on Mai&#39;s 
couch in the kunoichi&#39;s living room. 

&quot;Mary my favorite bounty hunter you woke up, finally!&quot; A well-known 
voice said. It was Mai who was getting into the room with a tray 
filled with food. 

&quot;I hope you&#39;re hungry and not too tired.&quot; She said. Mary sat up and 
covered her bare legs with the blanket she had nearly kicked of in her 
sleep. Mai lifted her one eyebrow as if she tried to peek before Mary 
was done but she said nothing. 

Mary looked at the plate, there were bacon, eggs, pancakes, miso-soup 
and noodles. There was also salad, eggs, juice, tea, coffee and of 
course a knife, fork and sticks to eat with. 

&quot;My gosh Mai, how&#39;d you think I&#39;ll manage to eat all this.&quot; Mary said 
in the friendliest tone that she was capable of producing, not wanting 
to hurt Mai&#39;s feelings. 

&quot;Oh, you don&#39;t have to. I wasn&#39;t sure what you Americans like for 
breakfast so I just took a little of that and some of that. I hope you 
like some of it.&quot; Mai smiled and sat down at Mary&#39;s feet. The bounty 
hunter bent her legs to make room for the kunoichi and took the plate.

&quot;Well to be totally honest I always liked the Japanese dish better.&quot; 
Mary said and took the bowl of noodles and the sticks. 

&quot;Mhm?&quot; Mai sounded surprised. 

&quot;It&#39;s good to get some variation.&quot; Mary said while placing the sticks 
correctly in her hand and putting them into the bowl. She rolled and 
grabbed some noodles.

&quot;Thank you Mai. Thanks for everything.&quot; She added before putting them 
into her mouth.

&quot;Arigato to you my dear Mary-chan. I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re happy.&quot; Mary 
finished the bowl quickly while Mai was talking about the other night.

&quot;Ah, you want some?&quot; Mary asked and lifted the plate for Mai. 

&quot;Me? Arigato but no thanks. I have already eaten. If you don&#39;t want it 
I&#39;ll save it for Andy.&quot; Mai took the plate but as Andy&#39;s name (...) 
was mentioned Mary was filled with something she wasn&#39;t used to; 
jealousy. &quot;Andy huh?&quot; The blonde made a fist out of her hand. 

&quot;Nani? You said something Mary-san?&quot; 

&quot;Huh me? Ah... Oh I said pass me the juice first.&quot; Mai looked at the 
plate. 

&quot;Ah, here Mary-san. One juice coming up.&quot; 

*** Desert Flower Hotel 10 minutes later. 

Dark Mai had to use plenty of energy in her tries to convert the 
military woman to like her. Then suddenly she noticed a relief. Leona 
was thinking something for herself and it was nothing that the mimic 
had planted into her brain. Dark Mai felt energies emerging from deep 
within of Leona&#39;s mind but she couldn&#39;t see what it meant. Suddenly 
Leona turned and looked the fake kunoichi in the eyes. With a somewhat 
curious look and no feelings to show on her face Dark Mai wondered 
what she was up to. 

&quot;Mai?&quot; 

&quot;Yes?&quot; 

&quot;I... was wondering... You know that what happened yesterday...? Was 
that... um... like a... a mistake... t-to you?&quot; Dark Mai was a bit 
confused by the question. 

&quot;Of course it was not a mistake! What did she mean by that?&quot; The mimic 
thought and tried to look away as she found Leona&#39;s gaze unpleasant. 

&quot;Because... t-to me it... maybe... maybe it w-a-s-n-t... I think I 
liked it and...&quot; Leona felt her control slipping away from her. It was 
as if her body screamed for her to throw herself over the kunoichi, 
take her, kiss her, show her the love Leona was feeling and make her 
feel as wonderful as Leona remembered feeling when the kunoichi had 
pressed their bodies together.

Leona leaned forward and grabbed Dark Mai&#39;s cheek. &quot;I&#39;m sorry... 
but... I... I think love you...&quot; 

Dark Mai shivered as Leona said this. This couldn&#39;t be right! Leona 
couldn&#39;t REALLY love her could she? Impossible! Dark Mai had used the 
charm spell so that Leona would be an easy victim for the next time, 
not fall in love with her! It had never worked that way, and not in 
such a small dosage. 

This was as she had been hit by a charm bomb with the power of the one 
behind the Hiroshima disaster. She was supposed to have a romantic and 
relaxed view of the mimic, not a furiously addicted one! The mimic was 
only interested in Mary in that kind of way not Leona. She liked the 
military woman, but not THAT much. 

&quot;Maybe I&#39;m exaggerating, just because she tells me that she &#39;thinks&#39; 
she loves doesn&#39;t mean that she will try anything stupid. Maybe she 
will settle for a kiss and an &quot;I love you too&quot;. 

&quot;It must have been the charm spell, when all that tension broke loose 
she must have lost control.&quot; Dark Mai thought. She looked at the 
military woman with a faked calm look. 

Leona said nothing, she let go of the mimic&#39;s cheek and just looked 
right back with tender eyes filled with expressions like insecurity, 
love and wondering. 

&quot;Hey wait! I can use this to my advantage! To get Mai out of my 
way...&quot; A plan was building up in the mind of Dark Mai. She had to 
fight hard not to grin evilly. &quot;If she tells me she loves me she loves 
Mai of course. I doubt that she really does, but at least she thinks 
so. If can get Leona so madly in love with Mai that she will stop at 
nothing to find her then Mary will be mine with while they are 
occupied with each other.&quot; Dark Mai smiled couldn&#39;t get away from the 
fact that she felt bad for using Leona in such ways. 

It was her mimicked mind telling her that she was mean to her friend. 
Even though her original mind could be dominating while on high energy 
the mind of Mai was still there blazing her with its kindness and 
feelings.

&quot;Damn, I... I like Leona too much to do such a thing to her... it 
feels like I am using her, like I will hurt her... Baka... What will I 
do now huh? I guess I couldn&#39;t live with myself knowing that I 
sacrificed Leona for my own good... &quot; The mimic looked at Leona who 
was still waiting for a response... &quot;But... hmmm... maybe... that 
would... yes it could. YES it could! If she want&#39;s Mai that bad I will 
simply be doing her a favor if I got them together, and then it will 
definitely be a free run for me. God how I love myself!&quot; Dark Mai 
laughed in her mind and smiled at Leona who almost instantly smiled 
back. 

&quot;C&#39;mon Leona-chan, let&#39;s go for a stroll and we can talk this over.&quot; 
She said and stroked Leona&#39;s cheek. Dark Mai had a pretty good idea of 
how to get Leona to her knees, more or less literally.

*** 12:25 am, a local coffee shop. 

&quot;Thank you again Mai, you have been so nice to me.&quot; The couple was 
sitting by a large window and it was a beautiful day outside. Mary had 
just finished her cup of coffee and Mai was about to order some more 
sake. 

&quot;You don&#39;t have to thank me I just said Mary-san. You&#39;re my best 
friend remember? You won your hundredth fight! I am going to take care 
of you this weekend; we have to celebrate seriously! And don&#39;t you 
even think about paying me back.&quot; Mai said. 

&quot;But I want to do something.&quot; Mary said. &quot;I can&#39;t just let you give me 
room and buy me drinks, dance with me and even serving me breakfast 
without paying you back somehow. Surely you can understand that.&quot; 

Mai sighed as she thought of the only thing that she would want in 
return from Mary. (And WHAT could that be, hmmm???) 

&quot;I couldn&#39;t ask for that...&quot; Mai said. 

&quot;Ask for what? Is there something?&quot; 

Leona was on her way back to the hotel. Mai had said she had to meet 
someone and she had told her the fastest way back. The military girl 
was so happy that Mai understood her feelings. Even when she doubted 
the kunoichi when she was about to leave, even thought it was only for 
a second, she immediately passed that thought as she felt Mai&#39;s lips 
to her once more. 

Leona was happy, in some strange way it felt so good when she was 
thinking of Mai. It had happened so quickly and yet it felt so natural 
right now. It was as if something had suddenly changed inside her 
mind, a dark wish that had suddenly broke loose from its chains and 
surfaced into her consciousness. Yes she was happy, for the first time 
in her life Leona was really sure of what it was that she really 
wanted. Something that she wanted for herself. 

After her was the mimic. It had disguised itself with different 
clothing and had changed back to its original form. An all white, 
featureless and barely humanoid shaped. It still was Dark Mai though 
but she needed the disguise for her plan, and besides it was a hell of 
a lot cheaper on her energy resource. Still in capacity of her alter 
ego&#39;s expert stealth techniques she was following the military woman. 
Like a shadow the mysterious shape followed close to the female 
assassin. By suggesting a path that led past the coffee shop of which 
Mai and Mary hopefully would be. 

Being well charged Dark Mai could sense the direction of the 
original&#39;s location by channeling on to her ki, she hoped that Leona 
would see the couple and hopefully end up attacking either Mary or 
Mai. Either way Dark Mai had a perfect opportunity of succeeding, 
although she would rather not have to hurt her friend. 

&quot;I hope they&#39;re curled up really tight when she finds them. How could 
Mai resist if she feels the same emotions for Mary that I do? This is 
perfect!&quot; Dark Mai grinned as she noticed Leona getting close to the 
coffee shop. 

&quot;At last. I thought she would never get there. Why does she walk so 
slow?&quot; 

Leona gasped as she thought she could hear a slight but obvious hiss. 
&quot;What the...&quot; As the military girl turned around in less than a 10th 
of a second she couldn&#39;t see anything. And sensing no ki around she 
shook her head. &quot;Maybe I&#39;m just tense. I need something relaxing.&quot; 

Leona noticed that the building she was crossing was a coffee shop and 
the assassin thought that a cup of tea would be nice. But as she 
looked further down beneath the sign she noticed a familiar person 
behind a large window. 

&quot;Is that Mai-san?&quot; Leona took a closer look, not getting too close to 
the window. &quot;And Mary-chan, what&#39;s she up to?&quot; 

&quot;Yessss!&quot; The shadow that was Dark Mai smiled large as she saw Leona 
looking through the window. 

She sat on the roof of the building on the opposite side of the coffee 
shop and peered over to the road. 

&quot;Now feel the agony of jealousy, prove that you love me and give me 
the girl called Mary.&quot; This was a verse that she repeated over and 
over again. The mimic grinned, but even if it was one of the few 
moments in her rather short lifetime that she had been truly happy she 
felt also horribly guilty for setting Leona up in this way. 

Dark Mai swallowed hard as she tried to put her mimicked pride to the 
side. Mai sipped some of the sake while peering to the opposite side 
of the table. She could see Mary&#39;s eyes showing both tension and 
excitement. They had been talking for quite some time before but now 
both of them sat quietly barely looking at each other. 

&quot;You mean that...? You really want that.&quot; Mary suddenly asked. Mai had 
been unwilling to haste her friend, but as things were know that could 
be hard. She had suddenly blurted out that the only thing she wanted 
in return for taking care or anything of her friend would be a kiss.

She didn&#39;t know what she had gotten the idea from. Mai had thought 
long of whether she would try to show her true feelings towards her 
friend or simply let it be. Terry was Mary&#39;s boyfriend, and Andy is 
Terry&#39;s brother and Mai&#39;s soon to be husband (Argh!) The situation had 
seemed impossible for the kunoichi until yesterday. When she had 
gotten the opportunity to rid off Terry. Mai had been careful and 
everything had gotten just fine. 

Except for the undeniable fact that she hadn&#39;t had the guts to tell 
her friend what was on her mind. And now she had, suddenly, did just 
that. The kunoichi wasn&#39;t sure whether she should be happy about the 
situation though. Maybe she had gotten to much sake. She knew she 
hadn&#39;t though but at least Mary would at least think so. Maybe it was 
best to leave before sabotaging their relationship totally. 

&quot;I guess I should be going... forget I said anything, I don&#39;t know 
where I got the idea.&quot; Mai was about to stand up but Mary grabbed her 
hand and she stayed. 

&quot;No, don&#39;t leave me like this... I... I have to talk to you.&quot; The 
kunoichi looked at her friend with wide eye&#39;s as Mary said this. 

Leona saw Mary touching the kunoichi&#39;s hand across the table. But 
pressing herself tightly to the wall on the side she could only see 
very little other of Mai.

&quot;What is she doing? She isn&#39;t touching my Mai-san!?&quot; Leona ignored the 
thought of looking suspicious to possible civilians and got under the 
window and peeked through with a very low profile. 

Inside she could see the couple talking about something. Although 
Leona couldn&#39;t hear what they said she could see Mary&#39;s hand gently 
touching her favorite kunoichi&#39;s. 

&quot;What are they saying, is she hitting on my Shiranui-san? She better 
not be!&quot; Leona continued to peek through the window but she couldn&#39;t 
see the expression on Mai&#39;s face. 

Dark Mai hummed musically as she wished for a fast victory. Mai just 
HAD to make a move on Mary, she must feel the terrible hunger for the 
bounty hunter. Still half singing Dark Mai peered over the road once 
again hoping to see a ravaged Leona. 

&quot;Dammit who&#39;s that!?&quot; Dark Mai moved half her body over the edge so 
that she could see further.

&quot;Another lady!? No, what is SHE doing here? And a another military 
too!&quot; She actually recognized the woman but couldn&#39;t remember the 
name. &quot;Could it be... umm... Tracy? Noo, she has blue hair, and 
besides Tracy lives in New York.&quot; The mimic pulled back after getting 
a good look and tried to remember the name of the woman. 

Leona looked up without taking a higher profile. A woman was standing 
on the other side of the window. 

She was wearing jeans, white boots, a white open blouse and a blue top 
underneath. 

&quot;Is there a problem?&quot; She said, and strangely enough she didn&#39;t get in 
front of the window to ruin Leona&#39;s hide. 

&quot;Shut up, I&#39;m on a stake out!&quot; Leona said instinctively without even 
realizing that she was lying. 

&quot;Well, I thought so, I kinda guessed by the clothes you&#39;re wearing.&quot; 
The woman said and got closer to the wall. 

&quot;Need any help?&quot; She said and showed Leona a police badge. She was 
from Interpol. 

&quot;Well, actually no. Just...&quot; Leona couldn&#39;t figure out what she should 
say. She knew the girl from one of the northern bases and didn&#39;t like 
lying to her. 

&quot;It&#39;s a private investigation. Just make sure nobody bothers me okay?&quot; 
Cammy nodded and looked around. As she looked up the opposite building 
Dark Mai threw herself to the floor of where she was lying. 

&quot;Fuck! It&#39;s her! This could be more complicated than I thought. What 
if I can&#39;t get to Mary now! Even if Leona freaks out I&#39;m sure she 
can&#39;t handle all three of them! Damn, damn, damn!&quot; 

The mimic carefully took a peek at Leona again. She was still sitting 
by the window but after a while she stood up talked to the military 
girl and went of.

&quot;Damn it!!! Shit!!!&quot; Dark Mai screamed from within and smashed the 
ground beneath her. As she did the floor cracked and her knuckles got 
all soar. The mimic tried to think of what to do as she licked the 
bloodstain off her aching fist. 

As she felt the sweet taste into her mouth she came to think of one of 
her own memories. She had seen that woman recently. Although she 
pictured her as a smaller one, the way that Cammy walked and the way 
she dressed made her look more adult than she actually was. 

Mai had got to know the woman when she had been with 

Leona and accidentally had gotten in the middle of a mission driven by 
Interpol. They only met once but they got along very well, maybe a bit 
too well. Mai could forgive the girl for trying to kill her at first 
due to the &quot;treatment&quot; she gave later. Dark Mai wasn&#39;t sure whether 
Cammy remembered though. After all she had been under the control of 
Bison at the time. The mimic also remembered taking a glance at the 
military girl in the tournament being with some other woman, more or 
less intimately and more or less not so fighting. However the mimic 
was not really that interested at the moment. Another plan was 
building in her rather misty mind. 

Mary carefully kissed Mai&#39;s hand. She stroke its&#39; backside gently 
against her cheek. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry Mai, if I had known I&#39;d would have... 
we could have talked about it... I would have been be glad knowing 
that there was somebody else, beside him...&quot; 

&quot;No, I&#39;m sorry Mary-chan. I should&#39;ve kept my mouth shut. If you don&#39;t 
want to I&#39;ll understand.&quot; Mai was nearly sobbing as she said this. She 
had definitely gotten to much alcohol. She was really aroused by 
feeling her friend so close to her. For the first time she was 
actually touching her. 

&quot;But if you really want that... it&#39;s so little... I... I guess it&#39;s... 
okay.&quot; Mary said. She trembled as she leaned across the table. 

She wasn&#39;t sure if she wanted this but the bounty hunter hoped that 
Mai would know what to do and get her mind on the right track. She 
wasn&#39;t thinking of Terry, even though she maybe should do just that. 
Mary didn&#39;t care what he would say. She wanted to try this. Just once 
and feel what it was like. She closed her eyes and whispered Mai&#39;s 
name. Mai was both terrified and relieved at the thought. It had 
happened so quickly and yet this was exactly what she wanted. She 
grabbed Mary&#39;s shoulders and leaned across the table... 

*** Desert Flower Hotel, 20 minutes later. 

Leona had gotten a Taxi. She wouldn&#39;t spy on her friend. She could 
wait until later and phone her newfound lover. Leona was somewhat 
excited. In a different way from what she was used to but it felt 
good. It felt sort of like, longing. She longed for the kunoichi. 

After getting back to her apartment Leona began doing pushups, always 
trying to be as efficient as possible while not working. She had to do 
something while waiting for the right moment to call the kunoichi. 
Leona felt disrupted by the thought of 

Mai being together with another girl than her however. Then she came 
to think of the kunoichi&#39;s final words: 

&quot;You are the only one for me Leona-san, aishteru.&quot; They had kissed 
once more and Mai had left her. 

Leona had always thought that Mai was busy with someone else. Andy 
(How many times am I going to go through with the agony of writing his 
name before making my point!?) of course or as Leona saw it maybe one 
or even some of her team mates. Mai was such an outgoing person. 

She liked everyone and everybody liked her. Leona did, and had done it 
ever since she saw her fighting in 94 for the first time while she 
herself still was a kid. She just hadn&#39;t realized it until now. 

Leona blamed it on the kunoichi&#39;s charisma, since everybody liked her 
why would she even look at the emotionless military girl that was 
Leona. She sighed at the thought. Somehow Mai HAD done just that. She 
told her. 

&quot;Ever since I saw you in our first battle in 96 I have been wanting 
this... Leona-chan, I&#39;m so happy that it finally came true.&quot; Leona 
sighed, that was three years ago. Mai had won the battle and Leona had 
never realized why, until now. She simply didn&#39;t want to hurt the 
first love of her life. 

&quot;Three whole years, what a waste.&quot; Leona thought, thinking all the 
wonderful moments they could have shared in all that time. &quot;I guess 
it&#39;s no point in loving someone if you don&#39;t have the guts to tell 
them, or even worse; not realizing it.&quot; 

Leona was glad that Mai had taken the initiative, or else maybe she 
would never have understood how she felt. &quot;And she wanted ME! Just me! 
Not the weird guardian gal. Not that tomboy bar 

host! Not the extremely cute Sakazaki girl! Not even the talented Todo 
warrior. And best of all, NOT that boring sucker Andy. 

She wanted ME!&quot; But then she came to another thought. She had been 
with Ralf and Clark for a long time without taking any affection to 
either one of them. She had never dated a guy before except for... in 
her mind the picture of Iori suddenly appeared. 

&quot;Of course how could I forget!?&quot; Leona smiled as she remembered their 
one, and sadly, only date so far. He seemed very interested, but as 
far as things had gone it hadn&#39;t been leading anywhere yet. 

&quot;I can&#39;t love them both right?...&quot; But for some reason she decided, 
for once in her life, that she wouldn&#39;t bother try to ignore or sort 
her feelings out. Not this time. She was too frisky from Dark Mai&#39;s 
words to care. &quot;Hmpf... It doesn&#39;t matter, I can love who I want, and 
I&#39;m in control of my own destiny!. And if 

ANYONE has a problem with that it would be VERY unlucky for them!&quot; 

Leona turned over and began doing sit-ups instead&#133;

*** 

25 minutes later. 

Mary was on her way home. She had told Mai that she had to think 
things over. &quot;I have to sort my feelings out.&quot; She had said. Mai who 
was a gentle person said it would be fine and that she could take as 
long as she wanted and maybe give the kunoichi a call later. Mary 
didn&#39;t really doubt her feelings towards her friend. 

What she really wanted was some time to think about what she would say 
to Terry and whether they should hide their relationship; especially 
from Andy (Sigh). She was sure she wanted Mai. She was sure she wanted 
to try what a relationship with her would bring. 

But it was still complicated and Mary hoped that Mai would know how to 
deal with the situation. Mary sighed as she got into her apartment, 
she had just moved in and there were boxes all over the place. Her 
favorite jacket hung gently over a chair and besides that the phone 
was the only thing she had unpacked. 

&quot;This will need a lot of work.&quot; She thought. As she began cleaning the 
room for the fifth time this week. She had begun many times but had 
never gotten very far before remembering she had something else to do. 

Several hours later Mary was too tired to continue and she went to 
bed. After brushing her teeth she got her clothes off and placed them 
on the same chair as the jacket. She sat at the end of the bed and 
tried to rid all the thoughts about her new experience. 

Mary didn&#39;t like to fantasize about someone she had just started 
something with. And yet it felt natural that she did. Confused by the 
thoughts going around in her head she decided to get to sleep right 
away, however the thoughts grew stronger and turned into what looked 
like erotic fantasies as the bounty hunter closed her eyes.

&quot;Shit! One day with Mai and I am getting all hot just thinking about 
her. Why does one kiss have to start such reactions.&quot; She thought. 
Again trying to rid her mind from any dirty thoughts regarding her 
friend Mary grabbed a book from one of the boxes. 

&quot;After the campfires by Per Jorner&quot; it read. Mary had gotten it from a 
European friend while touring France. It was written by some Swede, 
thereof the odd name. Her friend had told her that it was supposed to 
be both funny and very serious at the same time. 

Not that she cared, rarely ever reading many books apart from those 
about fighting and other arts. However it was thick and would surely 
keep the blonde from any distractions. 

&quot;Prologue...&quot; She read. It was quite a fascinating book about some 
strange fantasy land with talking cats and trees. Mary laughed out 
loud as she read the final line of the prologue. It was about a cat 
meeting a nervous timber man. After a long and odd conversation she 
read: &quot;Strange things, these humans.&quot; 

She kept reading. It was about friendship most obviously. Several 
short chapters about many people that didn&#39;t seem to have anything to 
do with each other but with a thin red line between them. After 
reading about strange wizards, a really cool dragon knight and a 
couple of thieves Mary noticed her one hand sneaking beneath her 
panties. 

&quot;What am I doing?&quot; She pulled her hand up again and put the book away. 
&quot;Damn, this isn&#39;t helping.&quot; Now her fantasies about Mai were even 
worse. She imagined them in a twin bed tightly wrapped around each 
other dressed only in their underwear. She imagined Mai&#39;s tongue 
gently licking her ear and neck. She saw how Mai was slowly untying 
her bra and asking Mary to touch her. 

&quot;Fuck! This is too serious. I can&#39;t be that much in love with her 
already, can I?&quot; Mary thought as she felt her sex getting all wet by 
the thoughts. &quot;I... I... can&#39;t.&quot; Mary tried really hard not to begin 
masturbating. She couldn&#39;t think of her friend that way. 

As someone to use when satisfying her own eagerness. Mary began 
stroking her breasts and placed a pillow between her legs thinking 
that it would lighten her desire by giving herself some pleasure but 
hinder her from cumming. It had worked before, after a while she had 
always gotten enough pleasure to be satisfied enough. But this time it 
got even worse. 

Mary could see pictures of Mai sitting on top of her waist with Mary&#39;s 
hands gently stroking her. She could see Mai&#39;s naked breast and how 
the kunoichi moved with the bounty hunter&#39;s hands. The hands slowly 
rubbing her chest and squeezing her breasts and the moving up to her 
neck. 

&quot;Oh god...&quot; Mary moaned. She was dripping wet by the thoughts and her 
hands stroking her breasts only made it worse. 

Mary was so aroused that her legs were squeezing the pillow hard 
against her sex. It felt quite good but the soft material wasn&#39;t 
enough for a release. Mary&#39;s head was so full of desire that she 
couldn&#39;t even concentrate enough to get the idea that she could go and 
do something else like watching an incredibly un-sexy movie. 

She could only think how to keep her hands from getting too close to 
her panties. Mai had turned around and Mary now had her head just 
beneath the white panties that the kunoichi was wearing. (This is 
called a &#39;69&#39; for all you who didn&#39;t get it right away.) 

If it hadn&#39;t been for Mai&#39;s legs lying heavily on Mary&#39;s arms she 
would&#39;ve touched them just to feel what it was like. Now the only 
thing that she could do was lie there and watch. It felt kind of nice 
just watching the beauty she had only a decimeter from her eyes. 

Suddenly she felt Mai peeling her panties off. 

&quot;Mai? What are you doing?&quot; 

&quot;Something that you will like very much, my dear Mary-chan.&quot; Mai said 
and kissed the inside of Mary&#39;s thighs. 

&quot;What?&quot; But Mary didn&#39;t even have time to protest as she felt 
something penetrate inside her.

&quot;Jesus!&quot; Mary shouted as she woke from her dream. She wasn&#39;t sleeping 
but still the dream felt like it was real. She noticed that she had 
thrown the pillow away and was now caressing the outside of her 
panties with both her hands. 

&quot;Well, I... I might just have to finish this. Or else I will never be 
able to sleep.&quot; She thought. Mary rolled to her stomach, bent her legs 
so that she rose upwards and then she slid her soaked panties off. 
&quot;This is wrong... But... I can&#39;t help myself.&quot; 

&quot;Hey!&quot; She heard a voice inside her head. &quot;Masturbating isn&#39;t wrong. 
It&#39;s having sex with someone you love.&quot; The voice faded away again and 
Mary didn&#39;t think about it that much. Surely it was another dream. On 
to more important matters she thought and slowly pushed a finger into 
her sex. 

It was really hot and it was hard for her not to move around too much. 
She leaned over the high end of the bed and held the cold metal with 
one hand while pushing into her sex with the other. 

Mai whispered loving words into Mary&#39;s ear while sliding her hands 
along the bounty hunter&#39;s sides. 

Slowly she let her fingertips touch Mary&#39;s bare skin. The sensation of 
this was so strong that Mary already began to moan quietly. Mai smiled 
and caressed the thighs of her lover as her hands came lower. 

With long and gentle strokes on both the inside Mai massaged the 
bounty hunter. Mary sighed as she felt Mai&#39;s breath against her neck. 
The kunoichi was sitting behind her and was giving her hot breaths and 
soft kisses all over her neck. Well, Mary was practically sitting in 
Mai&#39;s lap. 

She felt Mai&#39;s skin against hers and their bodies rubbing against each 
other in a rhythmic pace while the kunoichi quietly hummed a strange 
melody. It sounded almost like a lullaby song but it had a very 
different effect. The noises and melody Mai created worked to 
strengthen the effect of her caressing. Mary was totally enchanted by 
the melody. She was so stimulated that her whole body felt as if as 
mere sudden touch would bring her into ecstasy. 

The soft blanket smoothly touching her knees. Mai&#39;s hands caressing 
her thighs. The kunoichi&#39;s whispers and kisses against her soft skin. 
It was all blinding her mind. Mary could feel those things, and feel 
these things only. She could only smell the sweet cherry blossom smell 
of the kunoichi. She could now only hear whispers from the kunoichi 
and her own soft moans. She could still feel the wonderful taste from 
Mai&#39;s mouth and lips.

Mai had taken off her belt she had tied it over the eyes of Mary she 
could see nothing. And not seeing made the sensation even greater. 
Mary&#39;s other senses felt like they had been tripled. Every touch from 
the kunoichi brought her closer to climax. And she didn&#39;t even touch 
her sex. As Mai got to the very end of 

Mary&#39;s inner thighs she suddenly brought them up again. She began to 
hum musically again with a divine voice that both calmed Mary and made 
her even more excited. Mai began stroking Mary&#39;s breasts. 

First firmly and then gently while circling inwards with her fingers 
towards the pink nipple. Mary arched as she felt Mai&#39;s fingertips 
touch her nipples. The sensation was so great that she almost came 
from the feeling. 

She once again felt Mai&#39;s soft lips against her back, this time 
between her shoulder blades still humming the hypnotic melody. The 
spot was so right and it made the sensation even greater. It tickled a 
little but it still made Mary feel like she was on fire. Never had she 
felt such stimulation. It was as if every single part her whole body 
was capable of bringing her into an orgasm. 

It still wasn&#39;t enough however. She couldn&#39;t climax only by being 
touched in this way. It was wonderful but Mary felt as she needed 
more. 

&quot;Please Mai. Set me free...&quot; She whispered. 

&quot;As you wish my love...&quot; Mai said and untied the belt so that Mary 
could see. Before her the bounty hunter could see the face of her 
lover. With a divine look Mai smiled angel like as she put the belt 
down. &quot;I love you Mary...&quot; She said while she kissed all around Mary&#39;s 
shoulder and neck. She slid her lips all the way from between Mary&#39;s 
breasts up to her face. 

&quot;Ah...&quot; Mary sighed as she felt their lips together again. It was even 
better than before. The sheer taste of Mai&#39;s lips made Mary forget all 
other sensations. It was like tasting honey when you really felt like 
it. It was like eating soft ice cream on a really hot summer day. It 
was like drinking an ice cold cherry coke when in the Sahara desert 
(Ehh, Where is this getting me? Okay It felt really, really, REALLY 
good.) Mary loved every second of it. But Mai pulled away and looked 
at her.

&quot;Now lay back and I&#39;ll show you something you&#39;ll never forget...&quot; She 
said and pushed Mary down to her back. She slid her hands over Mary&#39;s 
muscular and incredibly well toned body once more and then over her 
thighs while spreading her legs. 

&quot;I want you to see this Mary. Or first time together...&quot; Mary looked 
down and could see Mai smile as she did. 

The kunoichi lifted her hand, stretched her index finger and then 
pushed it deep into Mary&#39;s sex. The bounty hunter was so overly 
stimulated and excited by the sight that she came instantly, she cried 
and came harder than she had ever done before. It was the first time 
that she had been cumming so hard that she couldn&#39;t stop herself from 
making noises. And this time it was so good that she nearly screamed. 

Her whole body cramped and her lower lips pressed hard against the 
kunoichi&#39;s finger. She saw stars before her eyes and bit her finger 
just to keep conscious long enough to feel the whole of it. As the 
world began to take shape before her again Mary felt her body spasming 
and riding the very last of the incredible orgasm. She felt nearly 
every bit of energy leaving her and she knew that she would fall 
asleep almost instantly from pure exhaustion. As she opened her eyes 
again to take a final look at the kunoichi she noticed that she was 
lying in her own bed once more. 

She had bitten her finger so hard that it was bleeding but she noticed 
that she wasn&#39;t touching herself as the other hand lay at her side 
grabbing and nearly ripping the blanket just as she did in her dream. 
Was it real, how had she managed to get such a fabulous orgasm if she 
wasn&#39;t touching herself? However, Mary was too tired and fell asleep 
only seconds after she had opened her eye&#39;s and thought about it. 
Falling asleep very quickly she had a rather dreamless night. 

Dark Mai licked her lips out of sheer joy. Peering through the window 
she saw the bounty hunter naked on her bed. She hadn&#39;t even had time 
to get her blanket. 

&quot;What a shame.&quot; The mimic thought. She touched the window and kissed 
it. &quot;Thank you my love.&quot; She whispered leaving a mark from her lips. 
The mimic hummed the hypnotic melody from Mary&#39;s dream and turned 
around. 

Mary was living on the third floor in an apartment for rent. The mimic 
would give her a better home than that. She would make Mary happy and 
redo the dream in real life whenever she asked. She would not be 
satisfied until she would be able to please her friend... lover... 
Dark Mai was confused for a moment. 

She felt something different. It was like... like... well sort of like 
lust... but in a different way. She felt something else for Mary but 
just plain lust. She wanted not only Mary&#39;s body but something else 
too. 

The mimic was very confused and jumped. 

*** 5:45 am, Sunday, Blue Mary&#39;s apartment. 

Mary woke up early when feeling a light breeze. She realized that she 
wasn&#39;t wearing anything and quickly got her blanket. After getting 
back to bed she thought about the night before. She had had some 
intense fantasies to say the least. They were so real that she could 
almost taste Mai&#39;s kiss still. But as she thought about she noticed 
something else. 

Loneliness. 

She felt really lonely. She slept in a single bed and had no one 
beside her. No one to talk to. No one to take care of her and no one 
to take care off. 

&quot;I gotta call Mai. I can&#39;t live like this. I have to have someone by 
my side. I...I love her and I&#39;m going to tell her. I&#39;m going to clean 
this apartment up and I&#39;m going to make it worth being here. I&#39;ll make 
it good for her. So that she won&#39;t leave me... hopefully&#133;&quot; Pictures of 
Andy and Terry appeared in her mind. 

&quot;Damn... I guess I can&#39;t have her... She wants that loser karateka 
too... I&#39;m only going to be her mistress... I guess...&quot; Mary was 
really depressed. The impossibility of the situation strained the 
bounty hunters mind to the point where she was nearly crying. Before 
she did however the phone suddenly rang. 

&quot;That&#39;s odd.&quot; she thought. Mary had just got it and she couldn&#39;t 
recall anyone phoning her since she had moved in. 

&quot;And in this time of day. Well, it must be Terry. He was the first one 
I gave the number after all. He&#39;s probably getting home from a journey 
or something.&quot; She dropped a box and picked up the phone. 

&quot;Hello? This is Mary&#39;s residence.&quot; 

&quot;Hello Mary-chan. It&#39;s Mai. I&#39;m sorry to call you right away but 
before you decide about us I need to tell you something.&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;I... I can&#39;t tell you over the phone. Why don&#39;t we meet up in the 
park. Is that okay with you?&quot; 

&quot;Well, I guess so...&quot; 

&quot;Fine, be there in half an hour!&quot; Mai said and quickly hung up. 

&quot;I... what the?&quot; Suddenly hearing nothing but the dial tone Mary 
wondered what was up &quot;I wonder what that was about. She told me that I 
should call, but if it&#39;s something important then I guess 

I&#39;ll have to meet her.&quot; Mary looked out of the window and realized it 
was still dark. 

She sighed and grabbed her jacket. She looked at the watch and turned 
the lights off. As she got out the door Mary realized that instead of 
being incredibly tired, which she had all rights to be at this time, 
she felt very comfortable and alert. 

&quot;Useful things these &#39;mobiles&#39; hm, hm...&quot; Dark Mai turned the mobile 
phone off and threw it away over the roof she was sitting on. &quot;Hmmm... 
ah... Finally we shall meet again.&quot; She said as she saw the bounty 
hunter walk through the door below her. 

With a mysterious &quot;cling&quot; she vanished into thin air. 

*** 15 minutes later. 

Leona had gotten information from an anonymous &quot;friend&quot; that she would 
find what she sought at the crossroad between Strasse and Main. 
Sometime about half an hour ago someone had thrown a rock through her 
window with a note tied to it. She didn&#39;t know what the message meant 
but she was determined to find out. It could as likely be a trap 
though. It wouldn&#39;t be the first time something like this would&#39;ve 
happened. 

But it seemed very obvious when she thought about it, maybe a bit too 
obvious. It was such an exceedingly simple trick to use only to pull 
off a trap Leona thought. It was still dark and she would have the 
advantage of stealth due to the larger shadows the darkness brought 
with it. Leona would have the opportunity to watch any suspicious 
happenings from a good and hopefully invisible view.

There was one problem though. As always the roads where stuffed with 
lights. It had always been a problem maneuvering in such a well-lit 
area. It was easier back home, not as many lights and lot&#39;s of 
missions in the local and well built flora. (i.e. Jungles and woods). 
She looked at her watch. &quot;6:04&quot; it read. 

If it had been a real mission Leona would probably know where and when 
to act. However the note was not very exact. It didn&#39;t tell time of 
day or exact spot. It didn&#39;t even 

tell what day. It just said &quot;come&quot;. Leona assumed the time would be 
about know since it came flying through her 

bedroom window just a short while ago. Anyone sending such a message 
and not wanting to meet directly would be quite stupid or incredibly 
forgetful. It all still seemed a bit too obvious. 

&quot;Better be really careful, just in case.&quot; She thought. 

&quot;6:05&quot; 

Leona curled together in a low profile a couple of yards from the 
road. She placed herself in the blind spot between two lights. Both 
because of the shadows and the light shining away from her. This was 
making it easier for her to see and harder for anyone to see her. 

As Leona peered over the landscape she thought of 

Mai once again. Maybe it was some date. Maybe Mai had threw the rock 
by some old fashioned and romantic thought wanting to surprise her 
friend some how. She smiled at the though. Both because it would be 
hard to just &quot;sneak up on&quot; someone like her and because it would be 
kind of fun if Mai found a way to do so. 

Yes it would be greatly appreciated if that was true but Leona was 
still on guard thinking that the note was only signed, &quot;a friend&quot;. It 
sounded more like she was getting set up for something else. 

Leona didn&#39;t find it necessary to call HQ though. This was something 
she could handle for herself. 

It could be far worse than most terrorist attacks and she would still 
manage to get away unharmed. It could be about an assassination and 
that would be like child&#39;s play for the experienced soldier. Bullets 
wouldn&#39;t stop her from escaping a situation getting out of hand. 
Knives, other sharp things and weapons made for close combat would not 
be a problem. She was trained for this. Waiting, observing and acting 
when necessary. She knew how to act and how to escape the most 
hopeless of situations. She knew how to make the most of any 
situation. Outnumbered, wounded or even a thing as exhaustion. It 
would not be enough for her to fail her mission. Someone would have to 
kill her before she gave up. And if her training wouldn&#39;t be enough... 

Leona shuddered. She didn&#39;t want to think about it. (A bit over-course 
from here on maybe?) If she would turn into Orochi she would have to 
get wounded so badly that she would normally have died before getting 
any serious injury. No one had ever managed to defeat her single 
handedly while in this form. She was quick enough to move faster than 
any normal human could ever hope to be able to react too. She could 
take some serious amount of beating before even grunting. And she had 
superhuman strength during the time that she was Orochi. A knifehand 
strike could easily slay a person with one blow. 

There was one catch though; It was not her but the Orochi that 
controlled her reactions. Mostly she ended up just killing and hurting 
people. In this way it was no real power it was about survival at any 
cost; some sort of defense mechanism. 

The only time she had been defeated while in Orochi form was after a 
mission gone terribly wrong. Somehow she had been seriously injured. 
HQ suspecting that she was still alive, seeing that a homing device 
she was wearing at the time was still moving around they went looking 
for her. They found her running amok in a small village killing 
everyone who got too close. Only with the combined force of the entire 
Ikari team she was defeated. And only because 

Leona was able to suppress the Orochi in the end when she succeeded in 
pulling her punches and moving at a slower pace (ie she didn&#39;t kill 
them and she was moving so slow that it was not totally impossible to 
get a decent hit.) Not even seven 45. bullets had stopped her. 

Mary saw a familiar figure sitting on a bench in the park. It was Mai. 
She was leaning towards and with one hand to her chin. Looking quite 
worried Mary felt sorry for her sitting out here all alone. She was 
wearing her fighting outfit but instead her red one she was wearing 
another that was dark blue. (...) Must be very cold in this weather 
Mary thought. 

&quot;M-Mai... You called me?&quot; Dark Mai looked up and smiled. 

&quot;Mary-chan you finally came!&quot; She said with an excited voice. 

&quot;Mai, why are you not wearing any decent clothes?&quot; Mary asked 
worriedly as she sat down next to the kunoichi. A light breeze flowed 
through the air and the mimic shivered. 

&quot;I wanted to look good, to you. I know you always liked this one 
better.&quot; She said and leaned against Mary. 

&quot;You can&#39;t sit out here like this, you&#39;ll catch a cold! Come on let&#39;s 
get inside, I can drive you to my place.&quot; 

Dark Mai was really tempted by the offer but she decided to stick to 
her original plan. She licked her lips in anticipation and grabbed 
Mary&#39;s hand. 

&quot;No! I want to stay here with you. I want us to watch the moon 
together. Please stay with me!&quot; Mary thought about it for a while. It 
was really cold outside but she also wanted to talk to Mai. 

&quot;Okay.&quot; She said. &quot;But here, take my jacket, it&#39;ll keep you warm.&quot; 
Mary took of her jacket and revealed a gray woolen shirt underneath. 
It would be enough, she thought and placed her jacket it over Dark 
Mai&#39;s shoulders. 

&quot;What&#39;s this!?&quot; Leona thought. &quot;It&#39;s that American girl again! What is 
she up to?&quot; Leona had seen the couple when hearing voices not very far 
from where she had been sitting. 

&quot;Why is she stalking my Mai-san?&quot; Leona moved nearer but she couldn&#39;t 
get close enough to hear what they said. She hid behind a tree about 
ten meters from the couple. There were no dark places or objects to 
hide in or behind that were closer than this. 

Mary sighed as she felt Mai&#39;s head against her lap. The kunoichi said 
she was tired and somehow she had ended up here. Mary looked at the 
nearly sleeping kunoichi below her. It was a beautiful sight to 
behold. 

Her soft and dark hair, her pink lips and her well toned arms. Mary 
was a bit jealous at the kunoichi for looking so perfect. She had 
herself a very well trained body and she was proud of it. But she 
lacked that extra sparkle; something that really flashed into the mind 
of any viewer. Ah, they couldn&#39;t be sitting like this all night. 

&quot;Mai, why don&#39;t we get inside for a while? It&#39;s freezing out here and 
you&#39;ll get really sick from falling asleep in such degrees.&quot; Dark Mai 
sighed deeply and turned to her back. She was now lying over the bench 
with her head and shoulders in Mary&#39;s lap. She had the jacket as a 
quilt. 

&quot;Ohhh... haum... only a little more Mary-chan...please... I can sing 
something for you if you like.&quot; She said. 

&quot;Okay, but only a short while, like ten minutes or something, you with 
me?&quot; 

&quot;Fine, *yawn*, what do you want me to sing?&quot; 

&quot;Well I... eh... I don&#39;t know. You have anything you want to sing... 
something you think is good?&quot; Mary asked. 

&quot;Sure...&quot; Dark Mai grinned evilly for a second and then coughed a bit. 
Took a deep breath and began to sing. It was not very loud and she 
didn&#39;t sing anything Mary recognized. 

It was a very sensual melody built from strange sounds and words she 
couldn&#39;t understand. She felt entangled by it. It was hypnotic and 
exotic at the same time. Mary leaned her head back and tried to fully 
enjoy the melody. It felt familiar somehow and still she knew she had 
never heard Mai sing it before.

With tunes that felt like caressing and with words that felt like 
kisses Dark Mai bound the bounty hunter to her song. She stimulated 
every part of Mary&#39;s mind with desire. It was like pressing buttons to 
receive the appropriate effect. Dark Mai had only recently learned 
this ability. It worked as a charm spell or force seduction but it was 
much cheaper on the energy side. However instead it required much 
concentration and a quite easily manipulated victim that would stay 
for a while one way or the other. It had worked on Leona after 
drinking and it was working on Mary that was really tired at this time 
of day... 

Mary was the ideal person to test this ability on. Both because she 
was to be in love with a male person, which made the whole situation 
more interesting, but mostly because she was the one that Dark Mai 
wanted. The one and only victim she wouldn&#39;t let anyone than herself 
get near enough to touch. Not any demon, not Leona, not the real Mai 
and not Jin. That was the thing that had gotten her into trouble in 
the first place. For reasons she couldn&#39;t understand Dark Mai had 
taken Mary from right out of his arms. 

Normally he wouldn&#39;t have bothered but as she had gotten between Mary 
and another demon he had sent out to catch the bounty hunter earlier, 
he wasn&#39;t very glad. Dark Mai didn&#39;t regret anything however. Strange 
as it seemed she was happy about her acting. 

Mary moaned in pure ecstasy when loosing herself totally in the melody 
going through her head. She moved under the mimic as if she tried to 
make something out of her desires building up. She searched for a 
release. 

Mary couldn&#39;t handle all the sensual stimulation forced into her mind. 
She moaned even more as her hands grabbed Mai&#39;s head in another 
attempt to find some satisfaction. 

&quot;Mai... I got to tell you. I love you and... I love you more than life 
itself... I love you and I want you to leave Andy so that we can be 
together! I can&#39;t live without you...&quot; She cried not even thinking of 
what she was asking. She didn&#39;t care for that matter. 

She had to have Mai or her whole world would crash down. Being frisky 
from Dark Mai&#39;s singing she grabbed Mai&#39;s head and pressed their lips 
together and for the first time in ten minutes the mimic&#39;s song ended. 
It was enough however and Mary would stay like this until she had 
gotten her satisfaction. Dark Mai was happy. Mary was finally kissing 
her again. Rough and passionately, just the way the mimic liked it. 

This was too much for Leona. She would have a little chat with Mary 
about a thing or to. The blackness of jealousy burned in her blood. It 
hurt. It hurt very much. She hated Mary for it. She hated her and she 
wanted to... Leona decided that she would keep control for a little 
while longer. It was not Mai&#39;s fault. 

Leona didn&#39;t want to hurt the kunoichi. It wasn&#39;t her. She had seen 
Mary throwing herself over the defenseless and tired kunoichi.

Leona decided to leave the scene hoping that thinking of what might 
happen next would be easier than actually having to watch it. She 
couldn&#39;t stop Mary from acting. She would risk Mai&#39;s safety. If she 
turned things could end up very bad. Leona had to confront the bounty 
hunter when alone, no matter how much it hurt her to leave things 
unresolved this way. Leona swallowed hard and tried to hope for Mai&#39;s 
good judgement to keep her from doing anything that she might regret 
as she left. 

&quot;I&#39;ll give you everything you ever wish for!&quot; Dark Mai said tracing 
the military woman&#39;s ki moving away from her. At last she could 
finally enjoy Mary for herself once more. She would use and remember 
every second of it&#133;

Next chapter: 

Mary is still trying to verify her feelings towards Mai who is 
fighting hard, and having the inner strength that Dark Mai obviously 
lacks, to let Mary have it at her pace. 

Meanwhile a very love hungry Leona watches as the couple get more 
intimate not aware of the Orochi transformation getting closer by the 
minute. 

Have fun and don&#39;t kill anyone having it!
