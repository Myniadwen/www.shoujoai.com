<h1>My Enemy, My Friend</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff4/index.html">Final Fantasy  4</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nekojin.html">NeKojin</a><br> </h2>
<pre>NOTES: This tale is the second part of my Final Fantasy IV trilogy, which
starts with &quot;Protector&quot; and ends with &quot;Reunion&quot;. Also, a lot of the story
material is a combination of invention and conjecture, since the game
doesn&#39;t deal with Rosa&#39;s situation during this length of time except for
two brief moments.

VARIANCES: For those who have only played the American version (easy type)
Golbeze=Golbez
Cain=Kain
Scarmiglione=Milon
Cagnazzo=Cainazzo

During any normal day in the Tower of Zot, bloodthirsty monsters ran around
loose in the halls, the dark lord Golbeze sat on his throne either growling
evilly or throwing things against walls, and Valvalis (the Emperor of Wind)
and her three minions patrolled the tower&#39;s lower floors to make sure
nothing got out of hand.

Today was definitely not normal, however.

----------

Recently, a human male named Cain had fallen under Golbeze&#39;s mind control
and was now his minion. Golbeze was happy in that strange way that evil
people show happiness; this was not only because of his new minion Cain (he
had never had a personal minion before), but also because during the
assault on Fabul, Golbeze not only took the castle&#39;s crystal but took a
prisoner named Rosa as well.

Now Rosa was a white mage and not at all comfortable with being in close
proximity to physical violence or evil intent, so needless to say, she was
terrified at her situation. Golbeze liked to watch terrified people, as it
made him feel better. To add to Golbeze&#39;s enjoyment, Rosa was the boyfriend
of Cecil, the Dark Knight turned Paladin who had previously put up little
resistance to Golbeze&#39;s plots but had now proven to be a rather large thorn
in Golbeze&#39;s armor-plated side. Golbeze relished revenge, especially
revenge on this Cecil character. Relishing revenge always made Golbeze
happy.

Since Golbeze was happy, everyone in the tower was happy (with the
exception of Rosa), because a happy Golbeze generally wasn&#39;t a bloody-
minded Golbeze.

Just a few days ago, Valvalis had grown tired of patrolling the floors,
saying she had far more important things to do involving being at Golbeze&#39;s
side for extended periods of time, so she had delegated patrol duties to
her three minions Sandy, Cindy, and Mindy, who called themselves the Magus
Sisters.

They weren&#39;t actually sisters, but were in fact unemployed ex-dancers from
Baron who had begun to rob and/or kill innocent travelers (often by magic,
therefore the Magus designation) to support themselves and their spending
habits. When their skills were brought to the attention of the forces of
evil, they were all offered jobs as Minions, First Class (attached to
Valvalis).

Despite the low pay, scant benefits, and total lack of a medical or dental
plan, the Magus Sisters collectively jumped at the chance once they met
Valvalis, since she was extremely attractive and tended to wear very
little, choosing instead to wrap herself in clouds when she found it
necessary to wear anything. The Magus Sisters were all very sexually
frustrated, due to some bad experiences while dancing in the Baronian
nightclubs, so just being around a liberated and liberal woman like
Valvalis did wonders for them and their feminine psyches. Valvalis loved
her minions in return and spent many happy times with them: teaching them
useful magic spells, flying around with them in the thin upper atmosphere
just outside the tower, striking the odd solitary wanderer with deadly
lightning bolts from several thousand feet, and other pleasant pastimes.

Lately, though, Valvalis had been spending more and more time with Golbeze,
who was very cheery thanks to Rosa, his main source of entertainment.
Golbeze was quite a charming individual when he was in a good mood, but
Valvalis wasn&#39;t interested in an employee-employer relationship, since that
was what a liaison with Golbeze would be. Valvalis was only interested in
Rosa. Rosa knew this, and it terrified her to no end, which pleased Golbeze
even more; naturally, Golbeze encouraged Valvalis&#39;s amorous pursuit of Rosa
merely for the pleasure he would get from Rosa&#39;s state of mental anguish.

----------

Today, Golbeze and Valvalis stood in front of Rosa&#39;s chair, located on the
Tower of Zot&#39;s seventh and highest floor. The chair was very ergonomically
designed, as it was Golbeze&#39;s old throne; he was nothing if not a man who
enjoyed his comforts. Rosa never noticed this, mainly because of two
things: first, she was tied up and unable to move; and second, there was a
large, heavy crescent blade hanging from the ceiling directly above the
chair. This was stressful for Rosa, to say the least, which always made
Golbeze happier.

&quot;Valvalis,&quot; Golbeze said after a moment, &quot;would you mind watching Rosa for
the day? I need to commandeer the Red Wings with Cain today to spread
terror and destruction over the land, so I&#39;ll be gone until tomorrow
morning at least.&quot;

&quot;Of course I don&#39;t mind, Master Golbeze,&quot; Valvalis replied. &quot;I know just
what to do with her,&quot; she added in a seductive tone, leaving no question in
anyone&#39;s mind as to the sort of plans she had.

Rosa whimpered, and Golbeze was rewarded with a fresh wave of fear and
disgust. &quot;Very well then,&quot; he said as he grinned joyfully underneath his
death&#39;s-head helm. &quot;I&#39;ll leave her in your care. Try not to kill her,&quot; he
added as a bit of an afterthought. &quot;I may need to use her as bait later
on.&quot; He teleported out of the room in a blinding flash of light.

Valvalis heard a soft moan and looked at Rosa, whose eyes were tightly
shut. &quot;Oh, come on, Rosa. It&#39;s not that bad,&quot; Valvalis said as she
sauntered over to where the terrified white mage was sitting. &quot;Now we can
spend some personal time together. I just know you&#39;ll enjoy it.&quot;

Rosa looked up at Valvalis, the terror quite evident in her eyes, and said
nothing. She didn&#39;t really need to, either.

Valvalis just sighed and walked behind Rosa. Without speaking or any kind
of pretense, she began to gently run her hands through Rosa&#39;s long, dark
blonde hair, finding out immediately that it was remarkably soft and well-
maintained. She immediately felt the shock that ran through Rosa&#39;s mind and
body - Rosa instantly froze as she tried to figure out just what was going
on. Valvalis giggled softly and walked back around into Rosa&#39;s field of
view. &quot;Now, didn&#39;t that feel good?&quot; she asked Rosa and smiled.

Rosa&#39;s eyes widened to the size of dinner plates and then closed as she
fainted.

&quot;Oh, you&#39;re just no fun at all,&quot; Valvalis said (unnecessarily) to the
unconscious Rosa as she untied her. Gently carrying her in both arms,
Valvalis flew away to her own personal area of the Tower of Zot: the
rooftop.

----------

Rosa awoke at the feeling of wind blowing against her face, which was
unusual, because the Tower of Zot was hermetically sealed, making every
breath of air seem stale. Rosa wondered where she was, then she finally
opened her eyes. The dark blue sky of early morning was overhead, dotted
with several small clouds here and there. Turning her head slightly, she
also saw a smiling Valvalis standing over her, quite naked.

&quot;Now don&#39;t faint again, Rosa,&quot; Valvalis admonished her. &quot;We have lots to do
today. I guess I&#39;ll have to take it slow so you don&#39;t go out cold on me
again.&quot; She was about to turn away to get something when Rosa finally
decided to speak.

&quot;I...I don&#39;t like...other women...&quot;

Valvalis bent down over Rosa, who was still lying flat on the rooftop. Her
hair blew slightly in the wind as she spoke. &quot;Oh, that&#39;s not true, Rosa.
It&#39;s just that you haven&#39;t had the opportunity to learn how fun it is yet!&quot;
She bent over even further until her lips were barely inches away from
Rosa&#39;s. &quot;And since Golbeze won&#39;t be back until tomorrow, I have plenty of
time to teach you.&quot;

&quot;I...um...but...&quot; Rosa stammered, and fell silent, blushing crimson.

Valvalis straightened back up and helped Rosa to her feet, holding her
hands just a bit longer than necessary. &quot;Well, this is my place,&quot; she said
brightly, &quot;so feel free to look around. Just don&#39;t fall off.&quot;

Rosa looked around cautiously, hoping to find some way of escape. The roof
was a rather small square, less than twenty feet across, with nothing on it
except for a large treasure chest, which was locked, and Valvalis&#39;s
personal bed. She carefully peeked over the edge and was hit by a terrible
wave of vertigo as she realized just how high up they were. &quot;Aiyaah!&quot; she
managed to say as she fell backwards and into Valvalis&#39;s waiting arms.
&quot;I...I can see all the way from Toroia to Baron from up here!&quot;

Valvalis smiled and bent her head down a bit. &quot;You know, your hair is
really sexy when it sweeps across my bare skin like this,&quot; she whispered
hotly in Rosa&#39;s ear.

Rosa blushed hotly. &quot;I&#39;m not...like that...&quot; she said, and tried to get out
of Valvalis&#39;s grasp, but Valvalis held her too tightly.

&quot;Seriously now, Rosa, why won&#39;t you just lighten up and have some fun?
It&#39;ll do you a lot of good, trust me,&quot; she added as she deftly removed the
unpleasant prisoner outfit Rosa was wearing and tossed it off of the tower.

Rosa blushed a deep crimson and tried to cover herself with her arms. &quot;I
promised Cecil...I...we would get married...and...&quot;

Valvalis laughed. &quot;Oh, come on, Rosa, you can&#39;t be serious. Denying
yourself all the pleasure you could have - for a MAN?&quot; She mischievously
tickled Rosa&#39;s inner thighs with one hand and wrapped her other arm around
her waist to prevent her from running off - not that there was anywhere to
run to, other than the rest of the roof. &quot;Besides,&quot; she continued as Rosa
struggled, &quot;men are untrustworthy. I can guarantee you that your precious
Cecil has spent more than a night or two in the nightclubs around Baron -
and if he does marry you he&#39;ll probably sneak off again some time and take
in the sights, just like any man. Soldiers are even worse,&quot; she added.

Rosa gasped. &quot;But he wouldn&#39;t! Cecil isn&#39;t...he wouldn&#39;t do that to me...
Would he?&quot; she wondered, wavering.

Valvalis sighed and released her grip on Rosa, shaking her head sadly.
&quot;Rosa, Rosa... Men are all the same when it comes to sex. Nothing is ever
enough for them, and they&#39;ll do anything to satisfy themselves...even if it
means being unfaithful to their wives.&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Rosa said, shocked. &quot;That&#39;s not possible! It...it can&#39;t be!&quot;

&quot;Just calm down, Rosa,&quot; Valvalis said softly as she walked her back to the
bed noting the tears welling in Rosa&#39;s eyes. &quot;Tension is bad for you, you
know.&quot; She laid Rosa gently on the bed, face-down, and began a firm but
relaxing shoulder and back massage.

----------

In spite of her situation, Rosa was able to relax a bit as she mulled over
the thoughts in her mind. She could barely even remember why she was so
afraid of Valvalis anyway...and her hands felt so good on her back, on her
shoulders...on her waist and thighs...on her breasts -

&quot;Aiyaah!&quot; Rosa said as she felt Valvalis&#39;s warm hands on her breasts.
&quot;Wh...what...what are you doing?&quot; She turned over on her back to look at
Valvalis, who was smiling gently.

&quot;Rosa,&quot; she said softly, &quot;what does it feel like I&#39;m doing? I&#39;m going to
teach you why women are better off with each other than with men.&quot; Valvalis
paused for a moment, withdrawing her hands, and looked intently at Rosa,
who blushed and fidgeted uncomfortably. &quot;Tell me, Rosa, do you think I
would ever do anything to hurt you? Never mind the fact that I&#39;m the
Emperor of Wind,&quot; she said to forestall the obvious argument Rosa was about
to make, &quot;just think of me as another woman. Have I ever been anything but
kind and gentle to you, Rosa?&quot;

&quot;Well...no, but...I just...I&#39;m not comfortable with...&quot; Rosa trailed off,
realizing suddenly that she actually was quite comfortable, except for
Valvalis&#39;s hands at her chest. She sighed. &quot;Why...are you doing this?&quot;

&quot;Three reasons: first, you&#39;re very cute,&quot; Valvalis said as she kissed Rosa
on the nose. Rosa blushed slightly. &quot;Second, you&#39;re young, so you still
have time to change your mind and form opinions. And third...&quot; Rosa blushed
again but didn&#39;t move as Valvalis put her hands gently on Rosa&#39;s breasts
again. &quot;...and third, I want to make you feel better than anyone else can
make you feel. Now listen closely, Rosa.&quot;

Rosa nodded and exhaled softly as the warmth of Valvalis&#39;s hands seemed to
melt into her skin.

&quot;Men think differently from women. Men always want sex. Now, women want sex
too, sometimes,&quot; Valvalis said as she lightly squeezed Rosa, which drew a
soft gasp and a blush, &quot;but not nearly as often as men.&quot; Valvalis leaned
closer to Rosa. &quot;Relationships between women don&#39;t have to be about
sex...it&#39;s just something that can happen. And if it does, it&#39;s nothing to
be afraid of - in fact, it&#39;s something you should really enjoy.&quot;

Rosa just nodded, red and unable to speak.

&quot;So...are you more comfortable with me now, Rosa?&quot;

Rosa nodded again.

&quot;Is there anything you&#39;d like to...do?&quot; Valvalis asked teasingly.

Rosa blushed again and closed her eyes, then reached up and encircled
Valvalis&#39;s neck with her arms. Valvalis smiled genuinely as she let herself
be drawn down to Rosa&#39;s lips, and the two women finally met for their
perfect first kiss together.

An intensely pleasurable shock rushed through the bodies of both women as
they kissed. Rosa&#39;s first thought was [This feels amazing!] as her lips
pressed firmly against Valvalis&#39;s lips. Her bare skin, against Valvalis&#39;s
skin, produced pleasure like none she had ever experienced in her life.
Just the feeling of their breasts touching each other started a dull ache
between Rosa&#39;s legs, and she broke off the kiss, gasping for breath, her
eyes still closed. She leaned her head back and moaned as Valvalis began
laying soft kisses all along her neck and jawline.

Valvalis was feeling the same sensations and having mostly the same
reactions. While Rosa wasn&#39;t her first lesbian kiss, she was probably the
best yet, Valvalis realized. [The way she reacts...her soft, yet firm,
young body...her silk-like hair...everything about her is just perfect,]
she thought as she let her hands squeeze and caress everything they
touched, eliciting another series of moans from Rosa.

&quot;Valvalis...&quot; Rosa said softly, after about five minutes.

&quot;Yes, dear? And please,&quot; she quickly added, &quot;call me Val.&quot;

Rosa nodded. &quot;Val...I&#39;m cold. The wind up here is really making me
uncomfortable.&quot; She pointed to her skin and Valvalis noticed that she was
considerably more pale than usual - almost blue in some places, in fact.

Valvalis nodded and gently rolled off of Rosa, noticing her shiver as the
rest of her body was exposed to the cold. &quot;Well,&quot; she began, thinking
quickly about what she might do, &quot;I don&#39;t wear any clothes, so I don&#39;t have
anything to give you...and the air inside the tower is really bad, with all
the monsters running around...&quot; Valvalis unlocked and rummaged around
inside the treasure chest, then closed it, shaking her head. &quot;Well, maybe
you should just hop under the covers for a while,&quot; she said, pointing at
the bed on which Rosa was lying.

Rosa nodded and quickly slipped under the covers, shivering. &quot;This isn&#39;t
really that warm,&quot; she said quietly.

Valvalis nodded and slipped under the covers, right next to Rosa. Folding
both arms tenderly around her, Valvalis whispered, &quot;Don&#39;t worry... I&#39;ll
keep you warm.&quot;

In a few moments, each woman was sound asleep in the other&#39;s arms.

----------

Rosa awoke slowly from a very pleasant dream, the first one she had dreamed
since being captured. She opened her eyes a bit to see the angelic face of
a peacefully slumbering Valvalis and smiled happily. I wonder what time it
is? she thought lethargically as she settled back into Valvalis&#39;s warm,
secure embrace.

Valvalis yawned and stretched out a bit, her eyes still closed as she
brushed against Rosa&#39;s body and reflexively recoiled in surprise. &quot;Oh!
Sorry, Rosa. I&#39;m not used to having somebody sleeping with me.&quot;

Rosa just smiled. &quot;I&#39;m not used to sharing a bed with anyone either,&quot; she
said shyly, and giggled.

Valvalis looked at Rosa and smiled wryly. &quot;And to think that just a few
hours ago, you fainted when I touched your hair...you&#39;re even more
beautiful than normal when you smile,&quot; she added.

Rosa colored slightly at the compliment. &quot;I am? Really?&quot;

Valvalis nodded and kissed Rosa gently on the forehead. &quot;It&#39;s warmer now,
since the sun is shining,&quot; she said after a moment, &quot;so I&#39;m going to go and
get something for you. I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; Rosa nodded, and Valvalis
rolled out of the bed and floated down the side of the tower.

After she left, Rosa rolled out of the bed and stepped over to the treasure
chest. She had noticed that Valvalis hadn&#39;t locked it after she looked at
it the last time, and Rosa was nothing if not curious. Carefully, she
lifted the lid and eased it back. It locked in place with a soft click, and
Rosa began to look around inside.

The chest was mostly full of potion bottles of varying sizes and shapes.
Rosa blinked as she pulled out, of all things, a spray can of whipped
cream. &quot;Now what would this be doing here, I wonder?&quot; she mused to herself
as she put it back and selected another object at random. It turned out to
be a small green bottle with a strip of masking tape on the side; someone
had hastily written the words Experimental Love Potion on the tape. Rosa
looked at it thoughtfully, then put it back again.

With a very quick movement she shut the chest and stood up to lean against
the bed; just in time, too, since it was then that Valvalis came floating
up the side of the tower and landed on the roof. Rosa turned to look at
Valvalis and was shocked to see ... tears? &quot;Val?&quot; she asked softly. &quot;What&#39;s
the matter?&quot;

Valvalis just shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s Cecil. He... he killed another of my
friends.&quot;

Rosa gasped, her face pale.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Valvalis continued sadly, &quot;he had to kill Scarmiglione to
become a Paladin... I didn&#39;t like it, but I knew it was inevitable... but
he just picked a fight with the Emperor of Water, Cagnazzo, and murdered
him. He didn&#39;t even need to do it...&quot; She collapsed on the bed and started
sobbing. &quot;Cagnazzo was... a nice guy... he didn&#39;t... deserve an end... like
this...&quot;

Rosa tried to think clearly. If Cecil had killed two Emperors already...
&quot;...that means he&#39;s going to try to kill you, too... doesn&#39;t it?&quot;

Valvalis just nodded, unable to speak.

Rosa turned even more pale. No words she could think of would adequately
express her feelings, so she did the only thing she could think of - she
crawled onto the bed beside Valvalis and just held her tightly, letting
Valvalis cry on her shoulder. She didn&#39;t even seem to notice the warmth of
Valvalis&#39;s body next to her own; only the tears trickling slowly down her
shoulder were important now.

&quot;Why...?&quot; Valvalis moaned softly.

The same question was in Rosa&#39;s mind. [Why would Cecil do that?] she
thought. [Is that just the kind of person he is, that he always has to be
fighting and killing? Even as a Holy Knight, a Paladin?]

[Cecil... How could you?]

----------

When Golbeze came back with Cain around midmorning of the next day, he was
intrigued by the curious emanations of strong emotion coming from the
seventh floor of the Tower of Zot. He quickly entered the room via his
usual method of teleportation and was immediately fascinated by the sight
he found there.

Valvalis was sitting in Rosa&#39;s lap, her head resting on Rosa&#39;s shoulder.
Rosa was staring straight ahead, a visage of pure fury darkening her face;
the emotion of hatred was so strong that even Golbeze, the Dark Lord, was
stunned by it. He turned around and left the room as fast as he could, but
Rosa&#39;s thoughts kept ringing in his head long after.

[Cecil... I&#39;ll never forgive you for this. I just can&#39;t.]
