<h1>Reunion</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff4/index.html">Final Fantasy  4</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nekojin.html">NeKojin</a><br> </h2>
<pre>NOTES: This tale is the third and last part of my Final Fantasy IV 
trilogy, which starts with &quot;Protector&quot; and continues with &quot;My Enemy, 
My Friend&quot;. At least, that was the idea. Depending on the reaction to 
this fic (read: the amount of emails I receive), I may add a fourth 
story to the trilogy, which would be another Rosa x Rydia lemon 
somewhere along in the storyline (or after it).

VARIANCES: For those who have only played the American version (easy 
type)
Cain=Kain
Golbeze=Golbez
Black Dragon=Shadow


It was probably the most hopeless time in Rosa&#39;s entire life.

The four of them - Cecil, Cain, Yang, and herself - were in the 
Crystal Room of the dwarves&#39; Underworld castle. They had just barely 
finished fighting some possessed dolls under Golbeze&#39;s command when 
the Dark Lord himself appeared. Even out of breath as they were, they 
had rushed to fight him. It was, Rosa thought at that point, a 
singularly bad move. She was proved all too correct...

Trapped by Golbeze&#39;s magic and unable to move, she was forced to watch 
the Black Dragon - one of Golbeze&#39;s pets that he summoned for the 
battle - knock out the other people in the party. Yang, the brave and 
powerful monk, was the first to go. Even while he fell to the floor, 
the dragon turned to Cain, the Dragon Knight, and struck him as well. 
Cain refused to cry out and hit the floor with a soft thud. Then the 
dragon pivoted around gracefully and faced her.

Rosa closed her eyes and winced as the dragon slammed into her body, 
knocking the wind out of her and blurring her vision. She tried to 
remain standing as long as she could, but her muscles gave out just as 
Golbeze&#39;s voice, echoing strangely in the chamber, called out, &quot;Now 
it&#39;s your turn, Cecil.&quot;

As she twisted and fell, the last sight she had was, of all things, a 
teenage girl, with green hair and long green robes. The girl came 
rushing toward her, but she couldn&#39;t see any longer.

Rosa&#39;s last thought was, [Was that... Rydia? But - no, she&#39;s not that 
old yet...]

Then even her mind went black.

----------

&quot;What?&quot;

The voice seemed to echo far above her. [Golbeze,] Rosa thought, 
surprisingly lucid for someone who was probably dead or dying, [it 
can&#39;t be anyone else.] She couldn&#39;t see anything, but somehow she was 
still able to hear, though the words were a little distorted.

&quot;That mist... blew my Black Dragon away?&quot;

[What the... what&#39;s going on?] the white wizard wondered to herself, 
then realized it was strangely getting lighter. Suddenly, with a flash 
of light and the sparkling of tiny angel wings, she was back in the 
Crystal Room, standing steadily on her feet and full of life and 
energy.

&quot;You can all move now!&quot; a voice called out, strong and clear. Rosa 
turned to the side to look... [Impossible,] she thought to herself. 
[Rydia was swallowed by Leviathan... she can&#39;t be here...]

But someone who looked remarkably like Rydia, the seven-year-old 
summoner of Mist, was standing right next to her. [This girl must be 
at least sixteen years old,] Rosa thought as she looked at the young 
woman, noticing her developing curves, her smooth legs, her beautiful 
face... then mentally she slapped herself. [I&#39;m in the middle of a 
battle with the most evil man there is in the entire world,] she 
rebuked herself, [and I have no time to be lusting over this sexy, 
young... blast it all, I&#39;m doing it again!] She forced her attention 
back to the trouble at hand.

Actually, the trouble was over.

Golbeze stood there with a look of shock and pain on his face, at 
least the little of it that could be seen behind his death&#39;s-head 
mask. &quot;How... why...?&quot; he managed to gasp, in a voice that sounded 
almost human for a second, before he doubled over and crumpled to the 
floor.

&quot;We&#39;ve done it! We&#39;ve defeated Golbeze!&quot; Cecil said breathlessly, 
sheathing his paladin sword. Then as one, the four of them turned to 
look at the young woman who saved them all.

&quot;Rydia?&quot; said Rosa, first to speak. &quot;Is that you?&quot;

The teenager nodded. &quot;Uh-huh, it&#39;s me,&quot; she said with a cute little 
smile.

----------

Later that night, Rosa was sitting on a bed in a small, private room, 
having a long, wonderful talk with Rydia since the men were off 
getting abominably drunk at the dwarven pub.

Golbeze had somewhat revived while the party&#39;s collective back was 
turned, so he had escaped with the crystal after all. Somehow, Rosa 
didn&#39;t seem to mind. [It&#39;ll work itself out eventually,] she reasoned. 
[Cecil will go in swinging his sword, and he won&#39;t quit until he&#39;s 
dead, so one way or another things will come to a conclusion.]

The first thing Rosa wanted to know was what had happened to the 
&quot;little girl,&quot; of course.

&quot;When Leviathan caught me, he took me to the Land of Summons,&quot; Rydia 
had explained. &quot;Time flows... a little differently there. I aged to 
maturity, but not beyond it somehow...&quot;

[Her figure has certainly matured,] Rosa thought now, blushing a 
little. Rydia was a very beautiful young woman, and her new clothing - 
shimmering green cleric-style robes which matched her hair - only 
accentuated her natural beauty. It was hard for Rosa to resist being 
drawn to her...

&quot;What are you thinking about, Rosa?&quot; Rydia&#39;s gentle voice interrupted 
her train of thought.

&quot;I was... um... nothing,&quot; she said, and blushed a little more. [Why do 
I feel this way?] Rosa thought. [I haven&#39;t lost all interest in men... 
have I?]

Rydia smiled softly. &quot;You can&#39;t be serious,&quot; she persisted. 
&quot;Something&#39;s on your mind... why don&#39;t you tell me?&quot;

[I guess she&#39;s matured in other ways, too...] &quot;It&#39;s... kind of 
private,&quot; Rosa said. Then, because of Rydia&#39;s soft sigh, she added, 
&quot;It&#39;s something that might frighten or disturb you, I think.&quot;

Rydia looked imploringly at her. &quot;Rosa... I&#39;ve already been through 
what feels like hell.&quot; [Mainly because it was without you by my side,] 
she added silently. &quot;None of your secrets are that terrifying, I 
think.&quot;

The white mage just sighed. &quot;I... I don&#39;t like Cecil any more.&quot;

The young summoner blinked. [Hardly disturbing...] &quot;Why not?&quot; she 
asked, putting an arm gently across the older woman&#39;s shoulders.

&quot;It was... it happened... when he killed Valvalis.&quot;

----------

&quot;Rosa, what&#39;s wrong? Help us fight!&quot; Cecil called out.

Rosa just stood there unable to think as her one-time lover, Valvalis, 
was being battered by Cecil, Cain, Yang, and Cid. [I&#39;m sorry,] she 
thought silently and brokenly, her eyes locked with those of the 
Emperor of Wind. [I can&#39;t stop them... I&#39;m sorry, Valvalis...] &quot;You 
don&#39;t need any help,&quot; she said with the barest hint of bitterness in 
her tone. &quot;You&#39;ve beaten her already.&quot;

Cecil looked puzzled, but he was a little too dense to understand this 
sudden change in Rosa&#39;s attitude. &quot;Oh... I guess you&#39;re right,&quot; he 
said as he turned back to see Valvalis stumble and fall. He didn&#39;t see 
the way Rosa winced as if she was the one being struck instead of 
Valvalis; he didn&#39;t see the tears fall from Rosa&#39;s eyes when the 
Emperor of Wind gasped her last breath and crumpled to the floor; and 
he didn&#39;t see the white wizard offer up a small prayer for her beloved 
and a curse on her ex-boyfriend.

[Val... rest in peace, always. And Cecil... I&#39;ll never forgive you for 
this. Never, damn you!]

----------

Rydia embraced Rosa, who was now softly weeping - the story of that 
battle had been a difficult one to relate. &quot;I don&#39;t know what to say,&quot; 
she said honestly, &quot;but... wasn&#39;t Valvalis evil?&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; she said, surprising Rydia with the vehemence and conviction in 
her voice. &quot;She was very kind and... loving... and she didn&#39;t deserve 
a death like that.&quot;

[Did that mean what I think it meant?] Rydia thought to herself. 
&quot;So... it&#39;s not just Cecil that you don&#39;t like any more, is it?&quot; she 
asked softly. &quot;Is it that you don&#39;t like... men... at all?&quot;

Rosa looked at the summoner and blushed. &quot;I... I guess that&#39;s it... 
it&#39;s just that I didn&#39;t want you to be disturbed because I&#39;m a... 
because I... well...&quot;

&quot;Because you like women?&quot; Rydia said, in a little softer voice and 
with a slight twinkle in her eyes.

The white wizard nodded as she blushed crimson. &quot;It&#39;s... it&#39;s 
embarrassing to talk about it.&quot;

[Well, if I can get her to talk a little more, maybe it will help ease 
the pain she carries.] &quot;Rosa, since you like women... am I attractive 
to you?&quot; the summoner asked with the ghost of a smile.

&quot;Oh, absolutely,&quot; Rosa began, then blushed fiercely. &quot;I... I mean... 
you&#39;re... you&#39;re a lovely young lady,&quot; she managed to finish, still 
very red.

Rydia giggled softly. &quot;It&#39;s okay, there&#39;s nothing wrong with being a 
lesbian,&quot; she said brightly, &quot;and thank you for the compliment. What 
is it that you find so attractive about me, anyway?&quot;

&quot;You kind of remind me a little of... of Val...&quot; Rosa said softly, and 
blushed again.

The summoner still refused to give up. &quot;Tell me about Valvalis, 
Rosa... what made her so special to you?&quot;

Rosa just sighed heavily. &quot;It... it isn&#39;t easy...&quot; she said, then 
blushed again as the younger woman gave her a little kiss on the cheek 
and sat closer to her. &quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; she said softly, and remembered 
what had been the best days of her life...

&quot;Val was... she was always very gentle,&quot; she began slowly. &quot;She was 
never in a hurry, or rough with me... she touched me softly and 
gently... oh, if only I could feel those soft hands all over my body 
again,&quot; she said wistfully, blushing a little. Rydia was making mental 
notes, unknown to Rosa as she continued. &quot;She never lied to me once... 
she always protected me from Golbeze, stood up to him... but mostly I 
remember her gentle touch...&quot;

Rydia smiled. &quot;Rosa... did you know that even the summoned spirits can 
be... lesbians?&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Rosa said, fascinated and intrigued, and not just a little 
turned on.

The summoner giggled. &quot;Well, there&#39;s Shiva... she&#39;s a lot like 
Valvalis, apparently, very gentle but firm... and the Sylphs are like 
little sorority girls, always running around looking for fun, innocent 
or otherwise... it&#39;s not a cause for shame or embarrassment in any 
way,&quot; she finished.

&quot;And, um... what about you?&quot; Rosa asked, blushing again. &quot;If that&#39;s 
not getting too personal,&quot; she hastily amended.

Rydia hmmed thoughtfully. &quot;Well,&quot; she said after some consideration, 
&quot;I&#39;ve never actually tried it, so I don&#39;t know that I can make a 
judgment on it... but Rosa,&quot; she continued with another little twinkle 
in her eye, &quot;you seem a bit tense. Why don&#39;t you lie face-down so I 
can give you a good massage? The Sylphs are great teachers.&quot;

Rosa happily complied, hoping for the same or similar gentleness she 
had received while in Valvalis&#39;s care. None of the men had ever seemed 
interested in giving her a massage, since they were always too busy 
fighting. She sighed softly as Rydia&#39;s hands touched her shoulders and 
began to rub downwards, the tension in her body fading rapidly. 
&quot;Mmmm... the Sylphs must have been wonderful teachers...&quot;

Rydia giggled softly. [You have no idea,] she thought to herself with 
a smile.

The white mage hummed tunelessly as Rydia&#39;s hands drew the remaining 
tension out of her body. It was very reminiscent of the time she had 
spent with Valvalis, and yet it was somehow different. [Not only 
different, but better,] Rosa realized. [I can actually relate to Rydia 
as another person, one who is on her level... I could never really do 
that with Val.]

Rydia worked her hands idly down Rosa&#39;s back, not really paying 
attention as she ended up with her hands pressed against the white 
mage&#39;s quite ample rear. When she realized what she was doing, she 
blushed a little and slid her hands back up Rosa&#39;s body. [Settle down, 
girl,] she told herself. [That can wait a little bit...]

Rosa had barely noticed, lost in her thoughts as she was. &quot;Rydia?&quot; she 
said, a little timidly. &quot;You must think I&#39;m awfully selfish, pouring 
out all my problems on you without listening to yours...&quot;

The young summoner just smiled. &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re selfish at all - 
in fact, I think you&#39;re a wonderful person.&quot; [Hmm... I wonder just how 
subtle that was. Or wasn&#39;t.]

&quot;Thanks... but why don&#39;t you tell me what&#39;s on your mind?&quot; Rosa asked 
gently as she rolled over on the bed. &quot;Here, you can lie down next to 
me if you want,&quot; she added, laying out her arm.

Rydia obliged and laid the back of her neck on top of Rosa&#39;s 
outstretched arm, letting out a little sigh as she did so. &quot;What&#39;s on 
my mind, hm? Well... I guess I&#39;ve been really lonely for a long time. 
There weren&#39;t any other humans in the Land of Summons, and I really 
haven&#39;t had anyone I could call a friend since I was a little girl.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve learned by experience to be distrustful of men in general,&quot; she 
continued, a little sadly, &quot;and I haven&#39;t found a single one who gave 
me any reason to start trusting them again... so as it stands, I could 
never have a meaningful relationship with a man, ever. It&#39;s just not 
possible.&quot;

Rosa blinked, momentarily at a loss for words. She leaned her head to 
the side to look at Rydia and found that Rydia was already looking at 
her. Their eyes locked, and she was unable to pull away from the 
summoner&#39;s gaze... even if she had wanted to. &quot;Rydia?&quot; she said 
softly, breathlessly.

&quot;Yes,&quot; the summoner replied. It wasn&#39;t a question - it was an answer, 
and a statement of intention.

Very encouraged, Rosa rolled over a little and gently kissed the warm, 
gently yielding sweetness of Rydia&#39;s lips. The young summoner moaned 
softly into the kiss and wrapped her arms around the older woman, 
closing her eyes as Rosa gently stroked her cheek with her fingertips.

The two of them lay like that for what seemed like forever, aware of 
nothing but each other. Eventually, Rosa broke off the kiss. &quot;Are 
you... are you sure about this?&quot; she asked, still a little unsure 
about what exactly was going on.

Wordlessly, Rydia rose from the bed. At first, Rosa was crushed... but 
then Rydia turned around and slowly shrugged off her green clerical 
robes, showing off every bit of her delicately formed body as the 
cloth dropped to the floor. She then unbound her hair, letting her 
long, beautiful green tresses cascade down her shoulders in a 
waterfall that nearly caused Rosa to faint in sheer happiness. Now 
entirely naked, the summoner climbed onto the bed, carefully 
straddling Rosa&#39;s waist. Taking the white mage&#39;s hands in hers, she 
brought them to her own chest, shivering a little as she did so. 
&quot;Please,&quot; Rydia said softly, almost whispering as long-supressed 
emotion choked her, &quot;be gentle...&quot;

Rosa tenderly massaged the younger woman&#39;s chest, feeling the nipples 
harden and press into her palms as she did so. She continued her 
gentle ministrations as Rydia carefully undressed her, unfastening all 
the buttons and clips of what she was wearing. After a brief pause as 
Rydia slid Rosa out of her clothes, moving them onto the floor with 
her own, Rydia once again lay down next to Rosa, both of them now 
fully unclothed. The two shared another kiss as their legs 
intertwined, and both women almost unconsciously began stroking each 
other with both hands.

A long time passed, with nothing to mark it but the soft sounds of 
pleasure coming from both Rosa and Rydia...

----------

It seemed like an eternity before Rydia slowly disengaged from a very 
euphoric Rosa. With a smile and a bit of a sparkle in her eyes, the 
summoner said, &quot;Now let me show you a little more of what the 
Sylphs... taught me.&quot;

Rosa giggled softly, then leaned her head back and moaned, her eyes 
reflexively closing as Rydia kissed her way down her neck, then down 
her chest, giving each nipple a slow lick and and a soft kiss. She 
continued trailing her lips down the white mage&#39;s taut stomach, 
licking inside her navel once, and finally reached her outer lips. 
Rydia circled the area once, delicately, teasingly, then lifted her 
head to see Rosa flushed and breathing heavily. &quot;Have I got you that 
excited already?&quot; Rydia said with a little grin.

The white mage just nodded. &quot;Val never... never touched me like that,&quot; 
she said with a radiant smile, &quot;and I&#39;m still trying to understand 
these feelings I have...&quot;

&quot;Should I slow down, then?&quot;

Rosa shook her head. &quot;Please... I need you...&quot; She blushed crimson and 
continued, &quot;I... want you... inside me...&quot;

Rydia giggled softly as she cupped the older woman&#39;s breasts and gave 
them a gentle squeeze, drawing a soft gasp from her. &quot;Now, how could I 
even *think* of refusing a request like that?&quot; she said with a grin, 
and dipped her tongue lightly into Rosa&#39;s moist folds. Drawing her 
tongue back out at Rosa&#39;s quiet moan, she thrust it back in, a little 
deeper this time.

Rosa moaned again and quivered lightly, running her hands through 
Rydia&#39;s beautiful hair as the summoner began to squeeze her chest 
gently while she continued slowly pumping her tongue in and out, going 
a little deeper and staying in a little longer each time. The feeling 
of warmth and wetness between her legs and the warmth and slight 
pressure on her breasts, coming from someone else - especially Rydia - 
was simply too much for her system to handle. Rosa let out an almost 
animalistic moan as she came nearer and nearer her climax. &quot;Yesss,&quot; 
she practically hissed between gasps for breath, &quot;ohhh yesss...&quot;

In the interest of prolonging Rosa&#39;s pleasure, Rydia began slowing 
down her licking and squeezing just enough so that she kept the white 
wizard on the very edge of the impending orgasm. She heard Rosa moan 
softly, questioningly, when she finally stopped her movements... and 
at that point, she firmly squeezed Rosa&#39;s nipples and at the same time 
gently bit down on her pearl.

Rosa finally lost all control, her back arching as her juices poured 
out into Rydia&#39;s eager mouth. Her hands reflexively pulled on the 
summoner&#39;s head, forcing her into Rosa&#39;s hips as Rosa almost screamed, 
her body shuddering wildly in the throes of pleasure.

Rydia returned to licking, making sure that she cleaned up every 
precious drop of Rosa&#39;s delicious fluids as Rosa weakly slumped back 
onto the bed, softly moaning Rydia&#39;s name again and again.

----------

A little later on that evening, the two girls lay naked on the bed, 
legs entwined once again, cuddling happily with each other.

&quot;Rosa?&quot;

&quot;Mmm?&quot; the white mage mumbled softly.

&quot;I really missed you while I was in the Land of Summons.&quot;

Rosa just smiled and gave the summoner a kiss.

Rydia returned the kiss passionately before adding, &quot;...but I didn&#39;t 
realize until today just exactly *how* I missed you,&quot; which caused 
Rosa to blush and giggle softly.

&quot;I love you, Rydia,&quot; the white mage suddenly said, quite seriously.

&quot;I love you too, Rosa,&quot; Rydia returned. &quot;I love you very much... can 
we sleep together tonight?&quot;

Rosa smiled, still a little red. &quot;I was going to ask you the same 
thing... let me put something up on the door first, though.&quot;

Rydia watched, somewhat amused, as Rosa found a sheet of parchment 
lying on a desk in the room and hastily scribbled something on it. She 
then giggled softly to herself and, as soon as she made sure no one 
was looking, stepped outside and fastened it to the door. &quot;All right,&quot; 
Rosa said as she closed and locked the door and then climbed under the 
covers, &quot;no one&#39;s going to bother us now...&quot;

In a matter of minutes, the two girls were cuddling once again, and 
eventually they both drifted off to sweet, sweet sleep in each other&#39;s 
arms.

----------

Later that night, Yang - less inebriated than the other two men and 
therefore still able to walk - was exploring the dwarves&#39; castle&#39;s 
halls. At some point he happened upon the very room in which Rosa and 
Rydia were staying. The parchment on the door attracted Yang&#39;s eye, 
and he looked closely at it; then he just smiled wryly and walked on 
down the hall.
