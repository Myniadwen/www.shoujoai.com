<h1>For More than Nothing</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../weisskreuz/index.html">Weiss Kreuz</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/starofheaven.html">Star of Heaven</a><br> </h2>
<pre>A/N:  This story takes place during the current arc involving Christine 
and Cedric, but there are no spoilers for that mission, as this fic is 
Kurumi-centric.  Enjoy!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Kurumi rested her chin on her hand as she leaned over the counter.  
Already midday, and there had only been three customers so far.  It was 
a slow day, so Kurumi wasn&#39;t expecting too many more customers.  Minding 
the shop was rather boring right now, as she had no one to talk to 
because the other employees were out on a mission. 

      She let out a heavy sigh and walked over to the tulips.  She 
reached out and lightly touched one of the small buds.  The flowers were 
beautiful, and pretty plants were really all that was needed for a 
flower shop.  Still, for one called the &quot;Kitten&#39;s House,&quot; maybe a pet 
cat as the mascot would be cute. 

      Kurumi giggled at the thought.  She would bring up that suggestion 
when the others returned.  She could easily be the one to take care of 
the cat since she really didn&#39;t have much else to do. 

      The bell chimed, alerting Kurumi to the presence of another 
customer.  She quickly turned around and, in English, said, &quot;Welcome to 
the Kitten&#39;s House.  How may I help you?&quot;  When she took a good look at 
the customer, her smile was replaced by an open mouth, the kind caused 
by surprise. 

      &quot;This is a nice shop,&quot; the woman said, her voice carrying traces 
of a foreign accent.  She had long, curly green hair and pale violet 
eyes concealed behind round glasses.  Her slender form was clothed in a 
light purple sweater and blue jeans.  She seemed peaceful, but also 
sorrowful, as if something regretful had happened to her not long ago.  
To Kurumi, this woman was absolutely stunning. 

      Hoping she wasn&#39;t blushing too much, Kurumi asked, &quot;Oh, are you 
also Japanese?&quot; 

      &quot;Yes, I am,&quot; the woman answered, switching to Japanese.  &quot;My name 
is Mayumi.&quot; 

      &quot;And I&#39;m Kurumi Shinjou.&quot;  Kurumi had also switched to Japanese, 
although she had given her name in the Western order. 

      &quot;That&#39;s a cute name,&quot; Mayumi remarked, stepping closer to Kurumi.  
&quot;Do you work here alone?&quot; 

      Kurumi shook her head.  &quot;The other employees are just out for a 
little while.&quot; 

      Mayumi crossed her arms over her (quite ample, as Kurumi couldn&#39;t 
help observing) chest.  &quot;And they left such a beautiful girl such as 
yourself alone?  That hardly seems possible.&quot; 

      &quot;Well&#133;&quot;  Kurumi turned her face away, hoping to hide how much she 
was blushing.  &quot;They had some important business to take care of, and 
since I could manage the shop&#133;&quot; 

      Mayumi chuckled.  &quot;You&#39;re such a nice girl, Kurumi.  If only there 
were more like you.&quot; 

      Kurumi&#39;s heart skipped a beat and then began beating rapidly.  The 
way Mayumi said her name was so&#133;so&#133;  Kurumi couldn&#39;t even think of the 
words to describe it. 

      Mayumi turned her head and then walked over to the pot of blooming 
cattleyas.  There was a smile on her pink lips, but behind that smile 
was a painfully obvious forlorn expression. 

      &quot;They&#39;re very pretty, aren&#39;t they?&quot; Kurumi said quietly, coming up 
behind Mayumi. 

      &quot;No, they&#39;re quite ugly,&quot; Mayumi disagreed, pushing her glasses up 
the bridge of her nose.  &quot;And yet, they can leave quite the impression.&quot; 

      Kurumi knew there was another meaning behind that sentence, but 
she didn&#39;t know how to reply to that.  Instead, she said, &quot;Is there any 
particular flower you would like to buy?&quot; 

      Mayumi shook her head.  &quot;No, I only wanted to look.  I actually 
quite hate flowers, but some can be rather beautiful.&quot; 

      Those words inspired some sort of strong emotion in Kurumi.  
Anger, perhaps, but Kurumi wasn&#39;t exactly angry with Mayumi, but was 
more mystified and strongly wanted to correct her.  &quot;All flowers are 
beautiful!&quot; Kurumi blurted out.  &quot;Some&#133;just haven&#39;t opened up yet.&quot; 

      &quot;What&#133;?&quot;  Mayumi seemed honestly surprised at Kurumi&#39;s words. 

      Her heart was racing and her breathing heavy, but Kurumi couldn&#39;t 
stop now.  &quot;Every flower is beautiful,&quot; she continued.  &quot;But if it never 
blooms and always hides within its calyx, no one will ever see that 
beauty.&quot; 

      Mayumi shifted her face away.  She didn&#39;t immediately reply.  
Finally, in a shaky voice, she said, &quot;I need to leave now.&quot; 

      As Mayumi headed for the door, Kurumi reached out and grabbed her 
wrist.  &quot;Don&#39;t go yet,&quot; the young girl begged, her voice almost a 
whisper. 

      Mayumi turned around and gently laid her hands on Kurumi&#39;s 
shoulders.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be back tomorrow,&quot; the woman promised.  
&quot;I just need to think about some things.&quot;  She lightly hugged Kurumi and 
then she was out the door. 

      Tears escaped from Kurumi&#39;s eyes.  She didn&#39;t even know that 
woman, so why did she feel this way?  Why did she say such things?  Did 
she even have a right to?  Mayumi was certainly very beautiful, but she 
was so cold.  And yet, underneath, there was this warmth that Kurumi 
could see easily.  Maybe she was the only one who could. 

      &quot;Mayumi&#133;&quot; 

      * * *

      A flower whose beauty would go unseen because it never bloomed.  
It could hardly have been more obvious about who Kurumi had been 
referring to, Tsuji thought.  But why would she say such a thing?  She 
didn&#39;t know anything about Tsuji. 

      Two teenage girls walked past Tsuji, chatting away in English.  
Tsuji turned her head and saw that they had just went into the flower 
shop. 

      Tsuji let out a heavy sigh as she returned her gaze forward.  She 
and Kurumi had one thing in common:  they both had the eyes of one who 
had stared down death.  Tsuji didn&#39;t want to think about how Kurumi had 
ended up in that position, but it probably had had something to do with 
Wei&szlig;. 

      Tsuji smirked as she adjusted her glasses.  Aya and Ken had done 
such a lousy job of hiding their tracks.  And, of course, a flower shop 
named the Kitten&#39;s House?  They really were asking for it.  However, 
Tsuji wouldn&#39;t answer.  She wasn&#39;t interested in extracting revenge. 

      Wei&szlig; and Rosenkreuz thought her dead, and she felt no need to 
correct them.  Although, if they actually thought about it, they should 
have realized that a mere slash across the chest wouldn&#39;t kill a 
genetically enhanced superhuman such as herself. 

      She laid her hand over her heart, where the tip of the scar was.  
It had taken her a while to recover, though.  While still in the 
hospital, she had visited a still comatose Yoji.  She had been 
discharged before he had awoken. 

      That slash to the chest did change her life forever.  She didn&#39;t 
want to hurt others anymore.  She still desired knowledge, but she could 
find peaceful ways to attain that goal. 

      However, while they both had seen death, Kurumi had not felt the 
pain of it as Tsuji had.  That was quite obvious.  But, if Kurumi stayed 
near Wei&szlig;, that was almost certain to happen.  Maybe Tsuji could remain 
nearby and rescue Kurumi if the need arose. 

      Tsuji chuckled at the thought.  From being am enthralling villain 
to a knight in shining armor.  She certainly had changed quite a lot.  
Yet, Tsuji didn&#39;t mind that.  Kurumi was a bit unusual if she could be 
so open with a stranger, but Tsuji truly appreciated her sincere 
kindness.  Tsuji would keep her promise and visit Kurumi tomorrow.  She 
could let Kurumi into her heart, but only Kurumi. 

      Smiling softly, Tsuji whispered, &quot;Such a kind girl.&quot; 

      * * *

      Night passed into morning, and morning passed into afternoon, and 
Kurumi wished that Mayumi had set a specific time.  She had been up 
since early morning, and her anxiety just kept growing.  Luckily, there 
had not been many customers today, and Kurumi had been able to deal with 
the few that had showed up with no problems. 

      Still, every time that little bell rang, her heart rose, but only 
to fall after seeing the customer was not Mayumi.  She considered 
closing the shop, but Ken and the others probably would not be too 
pleased with that. 

      The bell chimed once more.  Just another customer, Kurumi 
expected.  &quot;Hello, how may I-&quot; she began, speaking English, but she 
stopped herself when she lifted her head and saw who she was talking to. 

      Mayumi smiled softly.  &quot;Hello, Kurumi,&quot; she greeted in Japanese, 
her violet eyes sparkling behind her glasses. 

      &quot;H-Hi, Mayumi,&quot; Kurumi said, switching to Japanese. 

      Mayumi walked up to Kurumi, and Kurumi&#39;s heart beat faster as she 
struggled to make eye contact.  Mayumi was so beautiful, the young girl 
believed, even though sorrow lingered around the older woman. 

      &quot;Kurumi, I want to show you something,&quot; Mayumi said.  She turned 
her back to Kurumi and gripped the hem of her shirt.  She then took off 
her shirt and gently laid it on the counter.  Her fingers clenched up 
tightly, as if she was cold, but then she relaxed her fingers.  She had 
a nice, elegant back, Kurumi noticed.  But what was she&#133;? 

      Before Kurumi finished that thought, Mayumi&#39;s hands come up to the 
back of her bra.  She undid the hooks and then slid the straps off her 
slender shoulders.  She bent over slight so that she could remove the 
straps from her arms.  Once her bra was off, she placed it on top of her 
shirt. 

      Kurumi knew she should have found this strange, but she had never 
felt such an attraction to another person before.  And it was toward a 
woman, of all people!  She barely knew Mayumi, but she could only think 
of the word &quot;romantic&quot; to describe her feelings.  It was a strong word 
to use, and she hesitated using it, but when she did finally mutter the 
word in her mind, her heart seemed to feel more at ease. 

      Although, her overriding thought was that she was really hoping 
for Mayumi to turn around. 

      And Kurumi&#39;s wish was granted.  Mayumi turned to face Kurumi, and 
her scar was clearly visible.  It went from above her left breast to 
near the right side of her waist.  It should have been unsightly, but at 
that moment, Kurumi could only think about how beautiful and strong 
Mayumi was. 

      &quot;This is the price I paid for the life I used to live,&quot; Mayumi 
began.  &quot;Most people think I am dead now.  But I still live, and I won&#39;t 
return to how I used to be.&quot; 

      Kurumi stepped up to Mayumi, her eyes focused on the woman&#39;s scar.  
Hesitatively, she raised her hand, and after a moment&#39;s pause, lightly 
ran her fingers over the scar.  Mayumi&#39;s skin was very warm, Kurumi 
thought. 

      &quot;I am not a good person,&quot; Mayumi continued, her voice even yet 
sad.  &quot;But if you can show such kindness for me, I can live with 
myself.&quot;  She laid her hand over Kurumi&#39;s.  &quot;Kurumi, why don&#39;t you come 
with me?&quot; 

      The question was like a punch to Kurumi&#39;s gut.  She wanted so much 
to say yes, but it was such a sudden question.  She knew full well that 
she still had some unfinished business to take care of first.  &quot;Not 
now,&quot; she answered, thinking of how Mihirogi had told her that the Human 
Interleukin-3 in her blood could one day help people if used correctly.  
&quot;I still have some things to do here first.&quot; 

      Mayumi seemed to understand.  &quot;Then I will stay close by to watch 
over you.&quot; 

      Hope suddenly filled Kurumi&#39;s heart.  &quot;So, you&#39;ll visit often?&quot; 

      Mayumi shook her head.  &quot;I can&#39;t.  Fujimiya and Hidaka will not 
allow that.&quot; 

      &quot;Wait, how do you know-&quot; Kurumi started, but was interrupted when 
Mayumi laid her index finger on the girl&#39;s lips. 

      &quot;That&#39;s my little secret,&quot; Mayumi whispered, smiling 
mischievously.  She then embraced Kurumi tightly.  Slowly, Kurumi 
wrapped her arms around Mayumi&#39;s bare back. 

      Maybe it was a little odd to be hugged by a topless woman (who, in 
Kurumi&#39;s opinion, had rather nice breasts), but it didn&#39;t bother Kurumi 
at all.  It felt natural, just like her feelings for Mayumi.  It was 
such a sweet embrace, one that Kurumi would never forget.  She could 
feel Mayumi&#39;s heart beating against her own chest.  It was reassuring, 
as if Kurumi had doubted Mayumi&#39;s humanity after seeing that scar.  That 
heartbeat proved Mayumi was alive, and Kurumi was now certain that this 
love was real. 

      They pulled apart from each other, and Mayumi reached up to her 
face and removed her glasses.  Once they were off, Kurumi pressed her 
lips against Mayumi&#39;s. 

      It was Kurumi&#39;s first kiss, and she knew for sure that it was 
right.  Her heart beat faster, and her arms tightened around Mayumi&#39;s 
back.  She could feel the woman&#39;s heart also beating more quickly. 

      When the kiss ended, Mayumi placed her glasses into Kurumi&#39;s 
hands.  &quot;That was beautiful,&quot; she said, her violet eyes now free of 
sorrow.  She picked up her bra and put it back on, this time facing 
Kurumi.  She did the same with her shirt, and Kurumi watched intently, 
as she wanted to memorize every inch of Mayumi&#39;s gorgeous body. 

      As she pulled on the hem of her shirt to straighten it, Mayumi 
said, &quot;Kurumi, I lied to you yesterday.  I actually find cattleyas to be 
quite beautiful.  They are very inspirational to me.&quot; 

      &quot;That&#39;s wonderful,&quot; Kurumi replied, unable to think of anything 
else to say. 

      &quot;Well then, I should be leaving now,&quot; Mayumi decided.  She cupped 
Kurumi&#39;s chin lightly kissed the younger girl.  &quot;Thank you for 
everything, Kurumi.&quot; 

      Kurumi smiled broadly and walked with Mayumi to the door.  They 
shared another kiss, and then Mayumi left the flower shop. 

      This time, Kurumi did not cry.  She would see Mayumi again 
someday.  &quot;I&#39;ll be waiting for you,&quot; she said aloud.  To her chest she 
clutched the glasses of the woman she had so deeply fallen in love with. </pre>
