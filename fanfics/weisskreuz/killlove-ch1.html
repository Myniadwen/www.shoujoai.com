	-Leslie Parrish, &quot;Killing My Love&quot;

Hell laid her hand on the glass dome. Inside the steel tube was 
Masafumi. His face was void of all emotion and expression, but that was 
only natural. He was in that gray area between life and death. Whether 
or not he would return to life, only time would tell.

She prayed that their efforts were not in vain. They had just recently 
lost Neu; if they were successful in bringing back Masafumi, most likely 
they would also be able to bring Neu back as well.

It was a small glimmer of hope that distracted her from the fact that 
the whole plan was probably doomed to fail. Their hopes were possibly 
set too high in believing that they could also revive Neu; they hadn&#39;t 
even successfully revived Masafumi yet. Tot was the only one who truly 
believed that this plan would work; Hell and Schoen hadn&#39;t had the heart 
to tell her the real chances of success. And yet, they also refused to 
let their hopes die. Maybe they were too loyal to Masafumi, or just 
stubborn.

Quite unexpectedly, Tot came up behind Hell and tugged on her coat 
sleeve. &quot;Rabbi-chan wants to know when Papa will be able to play with us 
again,&quot; the young girl said, holding up her ragged stuffed bunny.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Hell admitted with a hint of annoyance in her cool 
voice. &quot;Hopefully soon.&quot;

&quot;Oh, okay...&quot; Tot replied, sounding and looking as if she had just been 
rejected. &quot;Papa, get better soon. And then maybe Neu will come back 
too.&quot;

Hell sighed heavily, but didn&#39;t say anything to that. Better to let Tot 
believe in hopes that were probably too good to be true rather than let 
her be depressed and moody. She had been enough of that after Neu had 
been killed.

Tot smiled weakly and then turned to leave the room. She brushed past 
Schoen, who had been standing in the doorway the entire time. &quot;You&#39;ve 
become quite cold,&quot; the blonde noticed, walking up next to Hell. &quot;Tot 
really believes that we can revive Masafumi.&quot;

&quot;Why shouldn&#39;t she?&quot; Hell retorted without even glancing at Schoen. 
&quot;This is practically fool-proof. I see no reason why we can&#39;t revive 
him. Don&#39;t you believe in our ability to do that?&quot;

&quot;Do you?&quot; Schoen&#39;s voice was firm, and her face expressionless.

Hell did not reply to that.

Schoen stepped up closer to Masafumi&#39;s tube. &quot;Everyday I pray for 
Masafumi&#39;s full recovery,&quot; she began. &quot;But a part of me is always 
worrying. I think, &#39;What if it doesn&#39;t work? What if he dies again?&#39; 
Maybe it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t want to go through all that a second time. 
I don&#39;t want to lose him again. I&#39;ve had enough misery in my life 
already.&quot;

&quot;You should have more faith in Masafumi,&quot; was Hell&#39;s curt reply.

Schoen&#39;s green eyes narrowed. &quot;You&#39;re too obsessed with bringing 
Masafumi back. I want to see him alive again as much as you do, but I 
don&#39;t think he would appreciate it much if you forgot about the members 
of Schreient who are still alive!&quot;

Hell&#39;s hand curled up into a tight fist, but she was able to hold her 
tongue. Schoen, noticing that, decided that she did not need to invoke a 
verbal reaction out of the dark-haired woman. Feeling a smug sense of 
satisfaction, the former model walked away, leaving Hell alone with 
Masafumi.

Hell relaxed her fingers. The nails had begun to dig into the skin of 
her palm. It was true that she had acted unusually cold toward Tot, but 
she wasn&#39;t the only one who was changing. Schoen was also beginning to 
seem more distant, more apathetic. Maybe she was just overly worried 
about Masafumi, but Hell felt like it was something more than that.

She let out another sigh. While reviving Masafumi was part of the reason 
she felt so tense all the time now, it wasn&#39;t the only factor. Schoen 
could be considered as another. The scientist had always been close to 
the former model, and they had worked extremely well together, but 
lately Hell felt this strange feeling toward Schoen. It was very similar 
to the one she had felt toward Masafumi.

However, the stronger that feeling became, the colder she became. She 
couldn&#39;t quite understand that. She knew Schoen was only trying to 
comfort her, and she wanted that comfort, but she refused to accept it. 
Why couldn&#39;t she express these strong feelings properly? Was she 
subconsciously trying to suppress them? Was it because she was afraid? 
Or ashamed?

Whatever the reason, she had to stop acting so cold around Schoen and 
Tot. If she didn&#39;t, what remained of Schreient would fall apart, and the 
last thing she wanted was to lose anyone else.

					*	*	*

Schoen slammed the door behind her as she stepped into her room. Hell 
was beginning to frustrate her. She really did want to revive Masafumi 
and get revenge on Wei&szlig; as much as the older scientist did, but the 
anxiety was making them all tense.

She sat down on a nearby chair and inhaled a few deep breaths to calm 
herself. It was unfair to blame all of her stress on Hell and Masafumi, 
she thought. Schwarz was also being quite a problem. They kept pestering 
Schreient for the comatose Fujimiya girl that the female assassins 
needed for their revenge against Wei&szlig;.

The former model ran her fingers through her wavy blonde hair. Being 
under all this stress would eventually give her wrinkles. But once all 
this was over and done with, she would finally have a chance to relax. 
And maybe she would be able to figure out her feelings.

A sigh escaped from her as she laid her head back. She knew that Hell 
had been the most affected by Masafumi&#39;s death. Still, she couldn&#39;t help 
but feel a bit of jealousy whenever Hell seemed to obsess over him.

She should&#39;ve been happy that Hell was so determined to bring back 
Masafumi, but instead she felt jealous of him. She wanted the attention 
that the older scientist was giving him. But why? She wasn&#39;t a little 
child that was desperate for attention.

Schoen held up her hand and studied her finely-done nails. Her eyes then 
traveled upward and observed all the photographs of her that covered the 
walls. They had come from various fashion magazines, and she was proud 
of every single photo that she had posed for. She knew that she was 
gorgeous. She had quite the fine and slender body with such big and full 
breasts. Her hair was the perfect blend of wavy and glossy, and she 
looked good in any outfit.

Still, none of this beauty mattered if Hell didn&#39;t think she was 
beautiful. She was dying to ask, but she never had the chance, and it 
didn&#39;t seem like it was going to show up anytime soon, not with Hell 
acting so aloof toward her. She hated that, so she was often cold 
herself, even though she really didn&#39;t mean to be.

Once, all Schoen had wanted was for the whole world to acknowledge her 
beauty again. But now, she just wanted Hell to recognize her beauty. It 
used to be that being acknowledged by Masafumi would fulfill her, but 
now she desired that fulfillment from Hell.

In frustration, Schoen kicked at the floor. Hell had no right to neglect 
her or Tot in favor of Masafumi, and she wanted to get that through the 
dark-haired woman&#39;s head. However, being cold and sarcastic wasn&#39;t the 
way it should be done. Maybe all Hell needed was a heart-to-heart talk.

The buxom blonde stood up and glanced toward the door. Whether or not 
Hell wanted to hear them, Schoen was going to admit her feelings.

					*	*	*

Hell had not moved since Schoen had left her. She stood still as a rock 
in front of Masafumi. Her brown eyes were completely blank, as if she 
was in a trance. In truth, she had much on her mind, even if her eyes 
did not reflect that. It seemed as if she was waiting for something. 
What that was, it was anyone&#39;s guess.

This was how Schoen found Hell when she entered the main room. &quot;Hell?&quot; 
she called out in a gentle tone.

That seemed to release Hell from her trance. She turned her head to look 
at Schoen. &quot;What do you need?&quot; Her voice was not cold, but neither was 
it warm.

&quot;I need to talk to you,&quot; Schoen answered calmly as she stepped up to 
Hell. &quot;It&#39;s about us.&quot;

The blue-haired woman sighed and completely turned her body to face the 
blonde woman. &quot;I figured you might say something like that,&quot; she 
replied. &quot;And I agree that we do need to talk. But I don&#39;t know where to 
begin.&quot;

&quot;That will probably be the hardest part,&quot; Schoen added.

For what felt like a while (although it really wasn&#39;t), nothing was 
said. It seemed impossible for either of the two women to find the right 
words to say. Maybe expressing their feelings through words wasn&#39;t the 
way to go. Maybe there was another way...

Hell raised her hands and lightly touched the sides of Schoen&#39;s face as 
the busty blonde laid her hands on the blue-haired scientist&#39;s 
shoulders. Somehow, this felt so natural, so right, and it was like they 
were about to finally express their feelings properly. They pulled 
themselves closer to the other slowly and patiently. Was this right? 
They wondered about that, but there was no doubt about the answer.

Finally, dark maroon lips met bright red lips. It was a very gentle 
kiss, but it freed the feelings that they had kept locked up for so 
long. They didn&#39;t know how long their lips were interlocked, but they 
didn&#39;t care.

But like all good things, this kiss had to come to an end. Reluctantly, 
Hell and Schoen broke the kiss and stared straight into the other&#39;s 
eyes. In less than a second, they had wrapped their arms around the 
other. However, unlike their kiss, their embrace was rather awkward.

Hell glanced at Masafumi&#39;s expressionless face over Schoen&#39;s shoulder. 
Technically, he wasn&#39;t alive, but he wasn&#39;t dead either. Was she still 
two-timing him then? With this thought, she slowly but firmly pulled 
herself out of Schoen&#39;s embrace.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Hell?&quot; Schoen asked, hints of concern visible in her pale 
face.

&quot;It&#39;s Masafumi,&quot; Hell answered. &quot;He&#39;s not dead. I don&#39;t want to two-time 
him.&quot;

Schoen tenderly touched Hell&#39;s cheek. &quot;You can&#39;t deny your feelings,&quot; 
she said. &quot;But do you really love him?&quot;

It was a while before Hell replied. She wanted to revive Masafumi more 
than anything, but she didn&#39;t feel the same passion toward him anymore. 
Somehow, Schoen had become the target of her passion. The blonde model 
was so beautiful, and there was something else about her, something 
special. Still, what was the most pleasing was that Schoen also felt 
that way about her.

A small smile came upon Hell&#39;s lips. &quot;I think I may have to give 
Masafumi &#39;the talk,&#39;&quot; she said half-jokingly.

&quot;Oh, I think he&#39;ll understand,&quot; Schoen reassured teasingly. &quot;He may even 
like the idea of us together.&quot;

Hell laid her hands on Schoen&#39;s waist. &quot;Karen, you&#39;re so beautiful,&quot; she 
pointed out in a seductive tone.

&quot;So are you, Chizuru,&quot; Schoen added, her voice equally heated. She 
pulled herself closer to Hell and their lips met again.

It had been a long time since they had last used or heard their real 
names. But it felt nice, and it made their relationship seem more 
natural. They kissed more passionately this time, and they felt like 
this was truly the right way to express their love.

					*	*	*

Tot looked down out the window of the upper level and watched happily as 
Hell and Schoen shared such a fervent kiss. &quot;Everyone&#39;s so happy now!&quot; 
she said cheerfully to her stuffed bunny. &quot;It was sad when they were 
fighting, but now they like each other again.&quot;

Her smile became even wider, but it did carry a bit of sadness. &quot;And 
soon, Papa and Neu will be back, and then we&#39;ll all be a happy family, 
exactly like we used to be!&quot; She hugged her stuffed bunny close, just as 
Hell and Schoen held each other tightly.
