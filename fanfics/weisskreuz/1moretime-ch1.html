<pre>A/N:  The two cities mentioned in this story do exist.  Look at a good 
map of Japan.  Anyway, enjoy!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Was she happy?  Aoi Chizuru often wondered about that.  She was 
comfortable in her job as a pharmacist and she had this decent 
condominium.  Still, she felt like something was missing... 

      Chizuru laid her head back and brought her legs up onto the couch.  
It had been two years since that day.  After the mansion had collapsed, 
Tot had freed Chizuru from the debris.  That telekinetic boy had been no 
where to be seen, but Tot had said that he had saved her.  Chizuru and 
Tot had then quickly found Schoen and had gotten her to a nearby 
hospital.  Although Chizuru had worried endlessly, the women of 
Schreient were almost superhuman, so it had been no surprise that Schoen 
had survived. 

      Tot had disappeared soon after Schoen had been admitted to the 
hospital.  The most Chizuru knew was that Tot was with a new family now.  
Maybe Tot was happier living far away from her memories of Schreient. 

      After Schoen had recovered enough to leave the hospital, she and 
Chizuru had gotten together one last time.  They had exchanged a few 
meaningless words before breaking off into their own directions.  
Chizuru had not seen Schoen since then. 

      Chizuru sighed heavily.  Why couldn&#39;t she let go of these 
memories?  They were like a noose around her neck and they threatened to 
strangle her if she didn&#39;t do something about them.  Masafumi and Neu 
were dead, Tot had a new family, and Schoen... 

      &quot;What&#39;s wrong with me?&quot; Chizuru wondered aloud.  She picked up the 
remote control and turned on the television.  She began flipping through 
the channels in hopes of distracting herself from her thoughts. 

      &quot;...and now, something new from rising fashion designer Kitaura 
Karen!&quot; 

      Chizuru froze.  Kitaura Karen.  Schoen&#39;s real name.  Chizuru&#39;s 
eyes were glued to the screen as she watched Schoen discuss her new 
dress designs with the overzealous fashion reporter.  What they said 
didn&#39;t matter; what mattered was Schoen. 

      No, she was Karen now.  Like Chizuru, she had probably abandoned 
her Schreient name in an attempt to begin the life of a normal woman. 

      It was Karen who weighed heavily in Chizuru&#39;s heart.  Chizuru had 
made peace with the fates of Masafumi, Neu, and Tot, but things between 
her and Karen were still unresolved.  She laid a hand over her racing 
heart; it felt as if it was going to burst if she didn&#39;t tell Karen her 
feelings. 

      Now that she knew what Karen was up to these days, they were on 
their way to reuniting.  And yet, Chizuru couldn&#39;t stop shaking. 
 

      The fashion company Karen worked for had its main building located 
in Fukushima, a long way from Yokawa, Chizuru&#39;s current &quot;home.&quot;  She 
would only be here for two days, and she hoped that would be enough 
time. 

      One day had already passed.  Chizuru had called Karen&#39;s office and 
had left a message on the answering machine.  Although she was uncertain 
if her message had gotten through, she was right now waiting outside the 
building. 

      Chizuru glanced up at the gray sky.  She had possibly been here 
for an hour.  Maybe this was pointless.  Karen probably didn&#39;t even want 
to see Chizuru.  After all, she had a good job at this fashion company, 
so why would she want to be reminded of her painful Schreient days? 

      Besides, the weather wasn&#39;t ideal for waiting.  It looked like it 
could start raining any minute now and it was surprisingly cold for this 
time of year.  Chizuru shivered as she wrapped her jacket tighter around 
her body.  Still, she didn&#39;t want to give up just yet.  She had to see 
Karen at least one more time. 

      Chizuru looked up at the cloud-filled sky.  &quot;Dammit Schoen, where 
are you?&quot; she whispered, intending for no one to hear her. 

      &quot;It&#39;s been a while since anyone has called me that,&quot; said a 
familiar female voice behind Chizuru. 

      Chizuru had forgotten how beautiful Karen&#39;s voice was.  Just 
hearing it again was almost enough.  &quot;Yes, it has been a while,&quot; the 
dark-haired woman replied, turning to face Karen for the first time in 
two years.  &quot;Old habits are hard to break.&quot; 

      Karen placed her hand on her hip.  &quot;That is true,&quot; she agreed, a 
small smile on her face but her voice cool.  She appeared as beautiful 
and as strong as ever, showing no signs that she had stared down death 
two years earlier.  &quot;So, Chizuru,&quot; she began, stressing Chizuru&#39;s name, 
&quot;why did you want to see me?&quot; 

      &quot;Because our relationship seems...&quot; Chizuru stopped herself.  
Seemed what?  Unresolved?  Incomplete?  Those words suggested closure, 
the end of the relationship.  The mere idea was like a rusty knife in 
Chizuru&#39;s heart.  She inhaled a deep breath and then said, &quot;It&#39;s about 
our relationship.&quot; 

      A forlorn expression appeared on Karen&#39;s face.  &quot;Yes, we did leave 
things hanging rather abruptly,&quot; she added.  &quot;Let&#39;s head over to my 
house.  We can figure out what exactly our relationship still means 
there.  We can walk; it&#39;s not far.&quot; 

      Chizuru nodded, and then she and Karen began walking.  They were 
side-by-side, with very little space between them.  Maybe their 
relationship still held potential, Chizuru thought.  Occasionally their 
hands brushed against each other, but Chizuru fought back the desire to 
grip Karen&#39;s hand. 

      &quot;You seem calmer,&quot; Karen noticed as the two women stopped at the 
crosswalk.  &quot;What happened to all that passionate anger?&quot; 

      &quot;I have nothing to be angry about anymore,&quot; Chizuru answered.  &quot;I 
live a rather dull existence now.&quot; 

      Karen raised her hand to touch the light scar on her cheek.  
&quot;Maybe you&#39;re right.  Though, I do miss that passion between us.&quot; 

      The streetlight changed, and the two women began crossing the 
road.  There was a bit more space between them, and Chizuru now wanted 
to wrap her arm around the back of Karen&#39;s waist. 

      They walked along a tree-lined road, past several small houses 
that looked eerily similar to one another.  Once the two women reached 
the end of the street, Karen said, &quot;This is my house.&quot; 

      Her house looked no different from the others.  It was white with 
few windows and only appeared to be one story high.  Karen unlocked the 
front door and she and Chizuru stepped inside. 

      &quot;You can have the spare pair of slippers,&quot; Karen said without 
glancing at Chizuru.  She kicked off her heels and then put on a pair of 
pale red slippers. 

      &quot;That&#39;s fine.&quot;  Chizuru took off her shoes and replaced them with 
a pair of gray slippers.  She then followed Karen into the living room. 

      &quot;Would you like something to drink?&quot; Karen asked, turning to face 
Chizuru as she removed her jacket.  She was wearing a shirt that 
revealed much cleavage, and Chizuru could see a small portion of that 
certain bullet scar. 

      Karen noticed that Chizuru was staring.  &quot;You don&#39;t have to 
stare,&quot; the blonde woman remarked as she hung up her jacket on the coat 
rack and sat down on the couch.  &quot;Just ask and I&#39;ll bare my breasts for 
you, like in the old days.&quot; 

      &quot;But those days are over,&quot; Chizuru responded, almost whispering.  
She put her jacket next to Karen&#39;s before also sitting down on the 
couch.  She left a lot of space between them. 

      &quot;Do you miss the old days?&quot;  Karen&#39;s voice seemed cold, but 
carried some hints of sincerity. 

      Chizuru sighed heavily.  &quot;I don&#39;t know.  Masafumi and Neu are 
dead, and Tot is living with a new family.  There&#39;s not much left of the 
old days.&quot; 

      &quot;I&#39;m still here.&quot; 

      Karen&#39;s warm words, said so quietly, were so surprising that 
Chizuru was almost in disbelief of what she had heard.  &quot;I&#39;m still 
here.&quot;  Those simple words brought out the hope in Chizuru&#39;s heart.  
&quot;And I&#39;m happy for that,&quot; she admitted, finding the right words with 
ease.  &quot;There&#39;s still a chance for us.  I want to continue our 
relationship.&quot; 

      Karen let out a small laugh and slid her hand over Chizuru&#39;s.  
&quot;All that love, sex, and passion,&quot; she started, her voice heated.  
&quot;Maybe I do miss it.  I would love to experience all of it again.&quot; 

      Chizuru raised her other hand and touched Karen&#39;s face.  The 
blonde woman was breathing heavily now, and her large breasts were 
moving up and down in rhythm with that breathing.  Chizuru felt an 
intense stirring somewhere deep inside as she moved her hand from under 
Karen&#39;s to the blonde&#39;s thigh, close to the hem of her skirt.  That 
strong feeling only intensified when Karen laid her hands on the 
dark-haired woman&#39;s breasts. 

      The lips of the two women become closer, but then they hesitated.  
They could very easily feel the other&#39;s hot breath.  The blonde woman 
tightened her grip on the dark-haired woman&#39;s breasts, and the 
dark-haired woman tightened her grip on the blonde woman&#39;s right 
shoulder and left thigh.  And then, for the first time in two years, the 
lips of Hell and Schoen were pushed together. 

      They fell backwards, with Hell on top of Schoen.  Schoen gently 
removed Hell&#39;s glasses and set them on the small table next to the couch 
as Hell&#39;s hands came together over Schoen&#39;s chest.  Their lips met again 
as Schoen&#39;s fingers began undoing the buttons of Hell&#39;s shirt.  When the 
kiss ended, the last button was released and Schoen rolled over so that 
she was on top of Hell.  The dark-haired woman pulled her arms out of 
the sleeves of her shirt and then seized the hem of Schoen&#39;s blouse.  
She brought it over the blonde&#39;s head and threw it onto the floor. 

      Hell&#39;s heart beat wildly.  As her eyes took in every inch of 
Schoen&#39;s torso, Hell felt a strong longing, like she was being 
pleasantly tantalized.  This was the passion that she remembered and 
craved for.  Schoen&#39;s hands went underneath Hell&#39;s bra and she bent over 
so that the two women could press their lips together once more.  The 
warmth of Schoen&#39;s body...  Hell had longed to feel it again these last 
two years. 

      When the kiss was broken, Hell&#39;s bra came off.  Schoen smiled 
seductively at the sight of Hell&#39;s bare chest.  She drew one of Hell&#39;s 
nipples into her mouth and the dark-haired woman wrapped her arms 
tightly around the blonde woman&#39;s slender back. 

      Hell moaned in pleasure as she felt Schoen&#39;s tongue on her 
hardened nipple.  Such a simple act, and it felt so good!  During that 
wonderful sensation, Hell unhooked Schoen&#39;s bra and slid the straps 
slowly down the blonde&#39;s arms, wanted to fully enjoy the sensation of 
touching Schoen&#39;s gorgeous body. 

      Schoen sat up and discarded her bra.  &quot;You&#39;re still as beautiful 
as ever, Hell,&quot; she said passionately, leisurely moving her hands down 
the sides of Hell&#39;s body. 

      &quot;And so are you, Schoen,&quot; Hell replied, her voice equally 
passionate.  She cupped Schoen&#39;s chest and pushed the blonde woman down 
onto the other side of the couch.  It was her turn to make Schoen&#39;s feel 
good.  She put her mouth over one of Schoen&#39;s breasts and slowly ran her 
tongue over the nipple. 

      &quot;Ah...&quot; Schoen sounded as she laid her hands on Hell&#39;s shoulders, 
close to the neck, and squeezed tightly.  Hell lightly brushed her teeth 
against Schoen&#39;s stiff nipple before moving onto the other one.  From 
that nipple, Hell kissed the scar on Schoen&#39;s chest, the scar that was a 
reminder of the blonde woman&#39;s strength and determination.  From there 
the dark-haired woman moved her lips up to Schoen&#39;s collarbone, then her 
throat, and then finally her lips. 

      While their lips were together, Schoen thrust her hand down into 
Hell&#39;s underwear.  Just the tips of her fingers found their way up 
between Hell&#39;s legs.  The dark-haired woman&#39;s whole body stiffened and 
her legs went straighter and further apart. 

      Hell threw her head back and gripped Schoen&#39;s large breasts 
tightly.  Merely the feeling of Schoen&#39;s fingers inside her was enough.  
Each moment of the blonde woman&#39;s fingers, even the slightest one, 
created a new and sensuous experience for Hell. 

      But those were nothing compared to the stimulations created once 
all pieces of clothing were off.  The passion that the two women 
continued to share didn&#39;t fade once during the night. 
 

      The morning light shone through the window upon Chizuru.  She 
normally wouldn&#39;t have minded, but it was shining directly into her 
eyes.  She groaned as she rolled over onto her bare back. 

      After all that passionate sex was finished, Chizuru and Karen had 
gone to the blonde&#39;s bed and had fallen asleep in each other&#39;s arms.  It 
had been a satisfying way to end the night. 

      &quot;Good morning, Karen,&quot; Chizuru said lazily, rolling over onto her 
side with the intention of giving Karen a kiss. 

      But Karen was gone. 

      Chizuru quickly sat up and frantically looked around until her 
eyes spotted a piece of paper on the night table next to the bed.  She 
picked up the note and it read, &quot;Chizuru, I&#39;ve gone to work.  If you 
don&#39;t leave soon, you&#39;ll miss your plane.  Karen.&quot; 

      Chizuru was shaking when she finished the note Karen had left.  
She wanted to ask why Karen would leave so suddenly, but she already 
knew the answer.  During the sex, they had fallen into the personas of 
Hell and Schoen.  The love and passion had been there, but once the two 
women had calmed down, the painful memories of their Schreient days came 
rushing back.  Chizuru and Karen had worked so hard to put their pasts 
behind them, and by leaving before Chizuru woke up, Karen obviously 
wanted to avoid having confront those painful memories again. 

      If they were just going to become Hell and Schoen every time they 
made love, would it really be worth it?  All that passion would come at 
a price, and that price would be to continuous experiencing those 
painful memories over and over?  Still, not all the memories of 
Schreient were painful; some were actually quite wonderful.  Maybe, with 
just those memories, Chizuru and Karen could love each other without 
regret. 

      Chizuru stretched her arms as her heart continued to scream at 
her.  She couldn&#39;t end things now, not after what had happened last 
night.  The love she and Karen shared was still burning brightly, and 
Chizuru wanted to keep it alive.  She was going to prove to Karen that 
they could love each other without being Hell and Schoen.  They had 
fallen in love as Hell and Schoen, but they could continue as Chizuru 
and Karen.  Chizuru was certain of that. 

      Chizuru quickly got dressed and left the house.  She was going to 
miss her plane, but she couldn&#39;t have cared less. 
 

      Chizuru was once again waiting outside the building in which Karen 
worked.  But unlike the day before, there wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky and 
it was pleasantly warm.  She was still anxious, but not because she felt 
conflicted.  This time, she was certain of herself.  It was just the 
waiting that was making her anxious. 

      The wait almost killed her, but it was worth it.  Soon Karen came 
walking out of the building.  &quot;Chizuru, what are you doing here?&quot; the 
blonde woman asked, plainly surprised.  &quot;Won&#39;t you miss your plane?&quot; 

      &quot;I know, and I don&#39;t care,&quot; Chizuru answered, turning to face 
Karen.  &quot;Karen, I don&#39;t want to leave you again.  After last night, I 
realized how much I need you in my life.&quot;  She was speaking quickly and 
breathing heavily.  &quot;We can experience that love and passion without 
being Hell and Schoen.  The past is painful, but if not for Schreient, 
we would never have met.  We can accept the past and continue our 
relationship as two normal women.  I truly believe that.&quot; 

      Silence followed.  Karen was impossible to read, so Chizuru 
couldn&#39;t predict what she would say or do next.  Finally, and quite 
unexpectedly, Karen laid her hands on Chizuru&#39;s shoulders. 

      &quot;I won&#39;t deny it; I am afraid,&quot; Karen began nervously.  &quot;I want 
that love back in my life, but I&#39;m scared.&quot; 

      &quot;I know,&quot; Chizuru said gently, placing her hands over Karen&#39;s.  
&quot;But I&#39;m here for you, and I won&#39;t leave you.  I promise to try my 
hardest to keep our relationship alive.&quot; 

      Karen sighed heavily, but then a small smile came upon her lips.  
&quot;I&#39;ve become such a coward in these last two years, haven&#39;t I?&quot; she 
noticed, her voice quiet.  &quot;But I don&#39;t want to live like that anymore.&quot;  
She appeared more confident now.  &quot;Chizuru, I love you too much to let 
you go again.  For you, I&#39;ll be brave.&quot; 

      Chizuru smiled broadly and wrapped Karen in a tight hug.  &quot;I love 
you too, Karen,&quot; she whispered into the blonde&#39;s ear. 

      &quot;Let&#39;s go home now,&quot; Karen suggested, slowly pulling out of the 
embrace.  She gripped Chizuru&#39;s hand and their fingers intertwined.  As 
they walked, their hearts seemed to beat in unison. </pre>
