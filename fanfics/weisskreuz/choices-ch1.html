<pre>A/N:  This story takes place during the Wei&szlig; Side B manga.  The whole 
story is from Kurumi&#39;s point-of-view, and may include some mild spoilers 
for the latest chapters, but nothing too specific.  Enjoy!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      I often wonder about the choices I make. 

      Should I really be here? 

      Should I have gotten away when I had the chance? 

      Do I regret my choices? 

      I really don&#39;t know what to think.  Lately I&#39;ve been such a 
burden.  I&#39;m only known as &quot;Human Interleukin-3&quot; to most others.  If not 
for my blood, many people would still be sane and alive and Krypton 
Brand wouldn&#39;t have had to get involved. 

      So, do I regret my choices? 

      Living or dying.  I still don&#39;t know which would have been more 
painful.  If I was dead, I wouldn&#39;t be here right now and I would be 
with my parents.  But I don&#39;t want to see them again, not ever.  I can&#39;t 
seem to forgive them.  The idea of sending eternity with them fills my 
heart with resentment.  I can&#39;t stand that horrible feeling; I shouldn&#39;t 
feel that way toward the two who raised me.  Still, if I weren&#39;t alive, 
others wouldn&#39;t be dying needlessly over my blood.  Living brings so 
much guilt. 

      But I&#39;m afraid to die.  My fear of death makes me want to live.  
It could be the only thing that keeps me alive. 

      Maybe living was the more painful choice, although I&#39;m still not 
too sure of that.  It&#39;s true that every day has brought a new burden 
since I chose to live, but dying would have been the coward&#39;s way out.  
I don&#39;t want to be weak.  If I had chosen to die, I wouldn&#39;t have the 
chance to put things right. 

      But what can I do?  Mihirogi told me the Human Interleukin-3 in my 
blood could have curative properties if used right, but I can&#39;t bring 
myself to believe that.  I want to, but so many have gone insane or died 
because of me. 

      Ken, Michel, Free, Aya, Yuki, Chlo&eacute;, and Mihirogi.  They&#39;re all so 
strong.  I&#39;m nothing compared to them.  I want to help them.  I don&#39;t 
want to be a burden to them anymore.  If I could find a way, I would use 
my Human Interleukin-3 to benefit them. 

      I try to keep hope, I really do, but I always fail miserably.  
Maybe someday I&#39;ll be strong enough to accept myself, but until that day 
comes, I&#39;ll keep on wondering whether or not I made the right choice. 

      I still don&#39;t know if I regret living.  But no matter how much 
pain my choices bring me, I&#39;ll become stronger.  Right now I&#39;m weak, but 
until I can stand on my own two feet, stay by me.  Even when I&#39;m strong, 
I still want you to be there, holding my hand.  Maybe I&#39;m just too 
scared to carry burdens all by myself.  I&#39;ve been alone for far too 
long. 

      Your arms around me are comforting and your shoulder is strong 
enough for me to rest my head on.  One day, I&#39;ll be as strong as you, 
and I will no longer feel like I&#39;m holding you down.  I won&#39;t be a 
burden to you or anyone else. 

      Mihirogi, I love you.  Because of you, I feel I can finally be 
strong. 

      And we share a kiss.  Mihirogi, you give me the strength to face 
my burdens.</pre>
