<h1>Light Beauty</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../weisskreuz/index.html">Weiss Kreuz</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/starofheaven.html">Star of Heaven</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It had been five years since that fateful day.  Five years since they 
supposedly died.  But only the assassins died.  The women underneath the 
assassin&#39;s mask survived.  They had continued to live as they attempted 
to lead normal lives.  Slowly they eased back into their former lives.

Carrying her sandals in her hand, she walked barefoot in the sands of 
the beach.  Her shadow stretched the entire width of the shoreline.  The 
sunset-colored sky reflected in her pale eyes and the sun&#39;s dying light 
shone upon her dark blue hair.  She felt peaceful, an emotion she rarely 
felt these days.  She gladly welcomed it, for she couldn&#39;t remember the 
last time she had felt that way.

She was with the Japanese Self Defense Force once more.  They welcomed 
her back with few problems; after all, she had been one of their most 
valuable members.  On the surface she was pleased with her life now, but 
underneath she was usually a bit sad.  She still missed Takatori 
Masafumi; however, after five years, she had begun to let go of his 
memory.

&quot;Strange to find you here, Hell,&quot; said a familiar voice behind her.  The 
voice was warm, but like hers, it carried subtle hints of sadness.

Hell of Schreient turned around to see that it was her former ally 
Schoen behind her.  &quot;Strange to see you here as well, Schoen,&quot; she 
replied.

Amusement gleamed in Schoen&#39;s eyes.  In Hell&#39;s opinion, she had grown 
more beautiful over the past five years.  Her blonde hair was still wavy 
and glossy, and because she was clad in a dark purple tank top with 
thick sleeves and a black miniskirt, it really stood out.  Her figure 
was perfectly slim, but not anorexic.  The faded scar on her cheek, 
which she had once been so ashamed of, was now carefully hidden by her 
thick hair.

Hell, on the other hand, had not changed much.  Her hair was a little 
duller and she still wore her thin-rimmed glasses.  She was clothed in 
an ankle-length white skirt, a maroon shirt, and a long, light jacket.  
Compared to Schoen, she felt quite plain.

&quot;So how have you been these last five years?&quot; Schoen asked Hell.

&quot;Fine,&quot; Hell answered dryly.  &quot;I&#39;m part of the Japanese Self Defense 
Force again.  So what about you?  Are you back in the modeling 
business?&quot;

Schoen nodded sadly.  &quot;It&#39;s not as glamorous as it was before,&quot; she 
added.  &quot;It&#39;s not because of the scar that Hidaka guy gave me.  It&#39;s all 
because of that Crawford bastard.&quot;

Hell remembered that clearly.  Five years ago, Brad Crawford of Schwarz 
had shot Schoen in the chest.  Most likely that left a very noticeable 
scar, and therefore she would no longer be able to model for bikinis and 
other types of swimsuits.

There was an awkward silence afterwards.  Hell didn&#39;t push the subject 
further.  It was obvious Schoen was very touchy with it.

Finally, Hell decided to resume her walk along the shoreline.  Schoen 
joined her.  For a while, neither of them spoke.  They just soaked up 
the peacefulness of the sunset.

The dying rays of the sun painted the sky an orangish-yellow with the 
faintest trances of a pale pink.  The normally clear-colored water 
reflected a yellowish color, with the tiniest specks of a light blue.  A 
soft breeze picked up some of the sand and dropped it into the water.  
Few people would not find such a scene to be beautiful and calming.

Hell and Schoen were now sitting down on the beach, near the waters.  
Hell had her legs stretched out in front of her while Schoen had her 
knees up to her chest.  Warm water splashed against their bare feet and 
between their toes.  Still, neither of them said a word.

Hell laid her head back and gazed upward at the dusky sky.  The sun was 
slowly but surely sinking below the horizon.  She closed her eyes and 
felt the gentle wind against her face.

&quot;How&#39;s Tot doing?&quot; Schoen suddenly asked, breaking the fragile silence.

&quot;Okay, I think,&quot; Hell answered.  &quot;I haven&#39;t seen her in three years.  
Last time I saw her, she was happy with her new family.  She has 
probably almost forgotten about her life in Schreient, but I think she 
still misses us and Masafumi.&quot;

&quot;I miss Masafumi too,&quot; Schoen added.  &quot;He was such a great man.  He 
saved me when I was kicked out of the modeling business all those years 
ago.&quot;  She sighed sorrowfully.  &quot;I&#39;m not beautiful anymore, am I?&quot;

Hell shook her head.  &quot;No, you&#39;re not,&quot; she agreed.  &quot;You&#39;re gorgeous 
now.&quot;  There was the faintest hint of a smile on her lips.

Schoen smiled weakly.  Hell was just being nice, she thought.  But it 
was kind anyhow.

The sun fell below the horizon as the two former members of Schreient 
silently reminisced about past events and all the happy times they had 
with Neu, Tot, and Masafumi.  Their remembrances cast a serene feeling 
over the both of them, and they longed for their former lives again.

Schoen found herself resting against Hell, but the other woman seemed to 
be completely oblivious to her, for Hell looked as if she was in deep 
thought.  Soon she stood up, and she also helped Schoen back on her 
feet.

&quot;Schoen, this is probably the last time we&#39;ll ever see each other,&quot; Hell 
began.  Then, in such a quick motion, she embraced Schoen in her arms 
and pulled the other woman close.  Schoen, once she got over the 
surprise of being hugged this way by another woman, returned Hell&#39;s 
embrace.

&quot;You&#39;re most likely right,&quot; Schoen agreed as Hell pressed her thick hair 
against the back of her neck.  &quot;But I&#39;m no longer Schoen, Aoi Chizuru.&quot;

The other woman smiled.  &quot;Is that so?&quot; she responded.  &quot;Well, I&#39;m no 
longer Hell then.  So Kitaura Karen, why don&#39;t we leave now?  It is 
getting a little cold.&quot;

And so the two women left the beach, also leaving behind their memories 
and personas of the once-great assassin group known as Schreient.
