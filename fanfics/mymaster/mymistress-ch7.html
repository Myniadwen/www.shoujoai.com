<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As I watched  the movie, I could distinctly feel the pounding of my heart. It wasn’t because of the gore on the screen;  Kasumi had cured me of any fear from horror flicks long ago- overexposure one  might say.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No, it was  the hand at my side that unconsciously tightened its grip every time something  sudden happened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Every so  often, I looked up at her face, the poker face that was determined to not show  any signs of fear. But I knew  better. The stiffness in itself was a  telltale sign. At a particularly  gruesome scene, I carefully laced my opposite hand with her hand that was sure  to bruise me at this rate, letting her grasp my hand instead.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I thought  she might pull away, a little flustered and stubbornly quiet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But she  didn’t even so much as look at me.  Rather, she tightened her grip on my hand, but at the same time lessened  the pressure, as if she had just become aware of how much it might be hurting  me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This wasn’t  the same Izumi I left behind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or was it?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If I really  thought about it, Izumi-san was always a bit protective of me. The incident with that group of males was  only a more serious portrayal of protecting me from stupid perverts like  Yoshitaka-san. It was the same deal…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘But before, she wouldn’t have dared  pretended we were dating in order to get out of a fight. She would have just punched them if they got  too close.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Was it a sign of simply growing  up and learning to end arguments through words before fists?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or was it  again… a sign of a suppressed desire?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I tried to  look at our current positions, my head on her shoulder, our bodies close  despite the theater seats, our hands laced together…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Who was to  say we <em>didn’t </em>look like a couple?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Certainly,  friends wouldn’t go so far for each other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Did she  really think we were just friends?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or is she  doing this… because she thinks this is what I want? To be shown what could have been before I get  married?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That’s  absurd. Izumi-san isn’t that kind of  person.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her heart,  despite her actions, would never be so cruel.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then to  keep any other perverts away? But it  didn’t look like there were any others like them still in the room…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I sighed  softly as I shook myself out of it, returning to the movie just as the end  credits were rolling up the screen. As  the lights turned back on, Izumi yawned and stretched, her arm freeing itself  from me as if it had never been there to begin with.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I felt a  little cold right then, but at the same time, a small voice inside me told me  this was how it should be.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smiled  at me. “What did you think of the  movie?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As we  stood, I returned softly, “The blood and gore was a little overdone, but the  plot was interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her smile  grew. “You thought so too? It wasn’t scary at all, was it? Though all the screaming  made my head hurt.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I couldn’t  help but laugh at that. “Maybe Mitsuki-san should have you audition for a lead role in the  next horror movie. I’m sure that’d be a  best seller.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Izumi  blanched at the idea, and I was reassured just a little more that this was  still the Izumi I knew. “No thanks. I’d rather not go putting <em>more</em> ideas into her head.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I heard it  before we even stepped outside the theater.  It had started raining.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Izumi  clicked her tongue as she looked up at the dreary clouds, “Another sudden  shower… we’ll have to wait it out I guess…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked  down the road, saw an umbrella bin sharing the same  overhanging as us, and then the mansion on a hill in the distance. I gestured as I suggested, “Why not just  share an umbrella? The mansion isn’t too  far away, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She opened  her mouth to respond, and then closed it with a frown. Looking in the same direction, and then at  me, she asked, “I forgot to ask… where did you say you were staying?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I pointed  in the opposite direction. “A hotel several blocks down that way. It’s nothing much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A hotel for two weeks?  Why? Stay at the mansion!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  hesitated, wanting to shake my head.  That place had too many memories for me to sleep there again. “That’s alright. I saved up a lot of money for this trip  anyway. And with the high exchange rate…  I’ll be fine. And I was actually  thinking of walking with you to the mansion and then going back to my place…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alone?!” She looked around, and then vigorous shook her  head, gripping my shoulders. “I can’t  let you do that. What if those guys come  back? They may be idiots but…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A silence  fell between us. The pattering of rain  didn’t seem to be letting up anytime soon.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then… want  to stay at my place until the rain stops?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I knew it  was a bad idea. Me and  my ex-crush alone in a hotel room?  After what happened in the movie theater? It was just screaming trouble.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I thought  for sure she would think the same-</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have you  unpacked yet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I stared at  her and murmured slowly, “No…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She walked  over and grabbed the lone umbrella.  “Then let’s go. I’ll help you  carry it to the mansion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Exasperated,  but at a loss at what to do with her stubbornness, I could only follow. After we’d huddled under the umbrella and  started walking, I muttered, “It really isn’t necessary to inconvenience you or  Yoshitaka-san…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, didn’t  I tell you? He’s away on business this week?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I couldn’t  help but stare. <em>‘Why do I get the oddest feeling that she’s the housewife having an  affair while the husband’s away?’ </em>“So  he left you in charge of the mansion?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yup.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I now saw  the twinkle in her eye at the thought, the happiness she still felt every time  Yoshitaka-san left her alone for a little while. No, I guess things didn’t change too much  after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But still… “Are you  living alone in the mansion right now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  considered the question a moment while I nudged her to take the next right  turn. “Well… no. Reira-chan- one of  the newest maids, and Mitsuki-chan  are staying there with me. But I’m sure  they wouldn’t mind seeing you.” She  grinned, happier than I had ever seen her, which was certainly something. “The three of us will be together again under  the same roof, if only for a little bit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That’s what  it was, wasn’t it. Reliving  the old times. She wants to  ensnare me back into our pocket reality of middle school memories. Where Mitsuki-chan  could plan out her own kidnapping with the help of the ghost of Yoshitaka-san’s father.  Where an alligator that acted like a perverted green Great Dane could  have free range on a top-of-the-line mansion courtyard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Where I  could blindly continue loving Izumi-san no matter how much I was hurt and  ignored.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘Well she’s not ignoring you </em>now. <em>Maybe there’s something to the saying  “absence makes the heart grow fonder.”’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The next thing  I knew, we were in the lobby of my hotel.  I looked down at our clothes, and realized that somewhere between strong  gusts of winds and the occasional extremely harsh torrent of rain, we had  arrived half soaked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A bellboy  offered us some towels.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After we had  dried off enough that we weren’t dripping everywhere, we headed upstairs with  the help of the elevator.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was just  the two of us.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">You could  hear the silence bouncing off the walls.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  disconcerting, to say the least.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I opened my  door, and it seemed the click had finally snapped Izumi-san out of whatever she  was thinking just then. With another  smile, one that I was beginning to question the sincerity of, she asked, “How  long have you been in town, Anna-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I frowned  as I removed my light jacket and went looking for a change of clothes. Mansion or not, I felt colder than I probably  was. “I arrived last night and slept off  my jet lag until late morning. Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have you  called Kasumi yet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Wondering  why she would concern herself, but feeling no reason to lie, I answered, “I  called her when I landed. I was too  tired to do anything beyond that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was  something about the way she looked around the room as she nodded softly that  made me feel like a surprise party was being planned for me right under my  nose.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay. You want to take a shower before we go then? We can stay here until the rain stops, but  afterwards, I’m taking you straight to the mansion. Taxi would be good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I sighed at  her persistence. It’s not that I didn’t  want to visit… but… if I went there with my things, it would be all too easy to  fall into the same pattern as before. I  stood up, clothes in hand. “I won’t be  long then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The hot  water felt unimaginably good.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I hoped I  hadn’t caught a cold.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As I was  drying off, I heard my phone ring in the distance, and even though it was  faint, I recognized the tune as the one I’d set for Kasumi. I looked around for said phone, before  realizing I’d left my purse with my jacket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then  suddenly, there was a knock on the door.  “Hey, Anna-chan, Kasumi’s calling you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘I know that!’</em> I started to wrap the towel around myself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She knocked  again, calling my name. The ring was  almost over.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Now, there  are two type of people in this world.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Those that  can handle panic-type situations with a level head, and those that can’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The latter  tend to do stupid and unnecessary things.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I must  admit that I’m generally guilty of being the latter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I called  through the door, “Hold on- answer it for me so she doesn’t hang up?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It took  about ten seconds after I heard her say the customary, “Moshi  moshi? Yes,  this is Anna-chan’s phone. No, I’m just a friend. This is Izumi…” that I realized that that  might <em>not</em> be what my fiancée wanted  to hear when she calls from the other side of the world to hear my voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I wrenched  open the door, only to have the action unravel the towel, which I quickly tried  to keep up while using the other hand to snatch the phone away from Izumi. I gave her an apologetic look even as I  closed the door almost in her face and spoke into the phone. “Kasumi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“…Anna-chan? Are you all right?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Trying to catch my breath, I  answered, “Fine. Why do you ask?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“You sound out of breath. Not to mention… why did Izumi pick up your  phone?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah… sorry… I told her to pick  it up while I was trying to get my clothes on… actually, I’m still not even  really dressed… can I call you back?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">See? I’m  telling you… my life is filled with stupid instances of bad judgment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“Oh… okay.  Well, you don’t have to call back.  I was just calling to see if you were having fun over there, and it  seems like you are. Something came up  and I have to go now anyway. But don’t  forget- I love you, my Anna-chan.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I let the towel slip to the  floor as her words struck a chord or two within me. That’s how I know I slipped up  somewhere. “I love you, too… Bye…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The click  and then the dial tone had such a combined sense of finality,  I sat down on the toilet seat, staring at the wall in a daze.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Guilt trip off a cliff anyone?</span></p>
