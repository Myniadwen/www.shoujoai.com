<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I took the  seat next to her, because I couldn’t stand the thought of both being as far as  across the table from her, and yet feeling her stare at me every time there was  a silence.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was a  bundle of nerves.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But also of joy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It felt as  good to hug her now as it had the last time I had hugged her so long ago.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No, it felt <em>better.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> Better than Kasumi?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I winced at  the thought, waving it away. I have to  prioritize.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Bowing my  head, I intoned, “Izumi-san, I’m really sorry for bothering you today!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Silence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then a  small laugh. When I looked up, she was  watching me from lidded eyes, one elbow propped on the table. “You know, an hour ago, I would have pummeled  whoever kept calling me and hanging up… but now that I know it was you, and  you’re here… I think I’ve lost the heart to.”  Her words were soft, melodious, even bemused and dream-like. “Strange…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A few  moments later, I snapped out of my daze and looked down at my lap. “Ah… I didn’t really mean to keep hanging up…  My fingers just… I mean… sorry…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  okay. Really. So what have you been up to? You haven’t really kept in contact… and  what’s that number you’ve been calling me from? It doesn’t show up on my  phone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah!” I bobbed my head in apology again. “I forgot!  After moving to Holland,  I’ve been using a prepaid card for long distance calls- it’s cheaper but I  guess the card doesn’t register on Japanese phones very well…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Holland?”  She seemed genuinely surprised. In turn, I was equally surprised if not  more  so that Anna hadn’t once gotten mad at me since I’d sat down. Perhaps  the years had mellowed her out… “By any chance… are you getting  married,  Anna-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>This is it.  The moment of truth.</em> Weakly, I held up my hand so that she could  see the ring.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I squeaked  in surprise when she grabbed my hand, probably faster than she had intended,  and examined the ring. “Amazing! Look at  that… such a nice quality… so who’s the lucky lady?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I stared,  half in a daze, looking between her beaming smile and her hand in mine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“I don’t care who Anna-chan  ends up with, as long as it’s not YOU.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I smiled and looked away, slowly  taking away my hands. <em>Idiot.</em><em> What had you been hoping  for? Anyone would react like that. Especially Izumi-san. You have no right to expect any more than  that.</em> “Her name is Kasumi. Sawatari Kasumi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I sensed  more than saw Izumi blink. “The same as  me…?” She laughed. “What a coincidence. Though I don’t think I know  anyone in my family by that name.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But that was what had drawn me to her in the  very beginning. But the similarities  stopped with the name.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey… Anna-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked up  at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Am I  invited to your wedding?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I wanted to  blurt out that of course she was, that there was no one else I would rather  attend my wedding…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>As my partner…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I shook my head, ridding myself  of the thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But she had  taken it as an answer to her question.  The happiness faded from her voice.  Again, only to be expected from an old friend. “Oh.  …Okay. Well yeah, I guess it  would be kind of awkward, for the both of us… Watching you kiss someone else  after you stole my first…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I blinked  and looked at her, not sure what to think. <em>Is she… jealous? No, that can’t be  it, not Izumi-san. Does she still resent  me for doing that? It was meant to be  playful, but I suppose I did go a bit far…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But Anna-chan…” She smiled at  me, and I thought it was a bit forced.  “Congratulations. I’m sure you’ll  be happy together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How are  you sure?” I frowned, finding myself  being sucked into her wavelengths. “All  I said was her name.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smiled  and answered easily. “She has to be good  if she agreed to marry you, right?” She  laughed and winked. “Even  better than me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A part of  me wanted to scream at her, <em>No! No one  could ever be better than you! Izumi-san,  don’t you see? I still-<br />
</em>I cut my own thoughts  off. “Are you still with Yoshitaka-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hm?  Well… yes… AH! Don’t get the wrong idea! I’ll never marry that  perverted ba- ah… I mean I’m staying at the mansion and making sure  he doesn’t seriously harass the new girls but…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As she  trailed off, I couldn’t help but feel confused.  Even after all this time… she doesn’t want to give me ‘the wrong  idea’? Is it because she wants to be  remembered as a decent person or…? “That  happened several years ago though, didn’t it?  Surely they’re used to him by now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She sighed  tiredly and leaned her head back. “Since  you left, he’s gone through a set of girls and recently brought in some new  ones. It’s a neverending  cycle…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you  still in debt?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The question  was simple enough. Though  I hated the part of me that hoped that she was only staying because of her duty  to justice in the world (helping new maids in distress) and debt beyond her  control. Not because she actually  loved Yoshitaka-san, like everyone else believed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Wrinkling  her nose, but putting on a sheepish smile, she answered, “Only a little  bit. I’ve been more careful recently,  and my job brings in enough money to make up for most of my slip-ups.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your job…”  I could feel my cheeks begin to heat up at the reminder. Keeping in contact with Mitsuki-chan  had meant access to her collection of pictures… which meant…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I put my  hand to my nose, sure that blood would flow out before  long.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At least I  wasn’t the only one at the table blushing.  She mumbled under her breath, “It was Mitsuki’s  idea…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know,”  she would never admit to it if it was her idea either, “you look as beautiful  as ever, Izumi-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She blushed  more at that, and I tried my absolute best to keep my hands on my lap. I couldn’t let our old relationship,  obsessive and unsatisfying, return. I  couldn’t indulge myself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That</em> way, at least.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Izumi-san…  are you free today?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At that,  she looked across the street at the shop, which was innocent enough in the  front. “Mitsuki  said a frequent-shopper wanted to meet me… but that can’t have been you, could  it? I mean, if you’ve been in Holland  all this time…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Indignation  spurted out before I could stop it. <em>I’m</em> her number one fan. I won’t let just anyone meet with her  alone. “It wasn’t me… but are you sure  it’s safe? To meet  them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Izumi  smiled a little. “You want to come with  me? It’s the only thing I was supposed  to do today. If you’re not busy… we  could hang out afterwards. Catch up on  things a little more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If she had  said this to me seven years ago, I would have gone to Heaven right there and  then.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Cue Pochi’s Godfather’s hamster mistress fishing. Catching a younger, dazed, Anna.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But now…  now that I was engaged…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I couldn’t  just…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“Do whatever you like. Just promise me you’ll come back in the  end. When you’re  satisfied.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I smiled nervously. “It wouldn’t be a bother to you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She leaned  forward, putting her hand up as if preparing to whisper something. I indulged and leaned forward to lend her my  ear. It sent chills, pleasant chills  that I had almost forgotten, to feel her cool breath on my ear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually,  it would be a great help. If it turns  out the person I’m meeting wants more than I feel like giving him, you’ll bail  me out, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A part of  me crumbled at that. Of  course. I’ll always be just an  excuse to you, won’t I? Nothing for my own merit.  Wouldn’t I just feel worse if I let her drag me along like this? “Of course I will, Izumi-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smiled  at me, and there was a moment when she was pulling back that our noses were  mere centimeters from each other. What  she confided in me at that moment… almost killed me. In a good way or bad way, I can’t be sure.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To tell  you the truth, Anna-chan… I haven’t actually thought  about you at all in the past several years…” She paused, and then her smile  brightened into something of an endearment.  “But today, walking here, meeting you again, talking to you again… I  realized… I’ve actually missed you a lot.  Life just isn’t the same without you.  Even if everyone else is still hanging around the  neighborhood.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“No matter what anyone else says… I always  want to be beside you…”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It occurred to me then, perhaps  for the first time, something I should have considered before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When she  had said that, so long ago, where did she get it from? It couldn’t have been a cheap soap opera,  like Yoshitaka had, or even a half-hearted rambling of things that sounded good  like I had done…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So what if  it had…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What if…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At the time…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A-anna-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">… She’d  been saying what was in her heart… even if her mind wanted to deny it?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It wasn’t  until I felt her hand on my cheek, brushing away my tears,  that I realized I had started crying.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Why do I  feel so sad… to be filled with hope?</span></p>
