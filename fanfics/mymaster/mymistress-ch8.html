<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The first  thing I asked when Anna-chan finally joined me,  dressed, phone in hand, and cursing softly, was “What’s wrong?”</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She only  shook her head, falling face first onto her bed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I glanced  at her phone. “What did Kasumi say?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She mumbled  something, but I didn’t catch it. She  repeated, “It’s nothing.” She sighed and  looked up at me pleadingly, “I’m sorry, Izumi-san… but I feel exhausted. I don’t think I’m up to going to the mansion  today. So could you just…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I frowned,  leaning forward to feel her forehead. I  was honestly surprised when she flinched away from my touch. For as long as I can recall, Anna-chan never did that.  She always seemed so fearlessly ready to jump to the next thing…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not  sick.” She shook her head as she sat  up. “I just… could you just let me be  for a little while? Alone? It’s been a long day…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It wasn’t  that bad, was it? Well… she did spend  her morning trying to reach me… and then we met at the café… spent time in the  lingerie store… met a couple of guys in the movie theater… and with Kasumi  calling… I sighed and nodded, standing  up. “All right. Do you still want to come to the  mansion? If not today,  then tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll think  about it. Not today though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘I had a feeling she would say that…’</em> “Okay. Give me a call if you want to  hang out again, won’t you? I promise I  won’t hang up on you if you don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  chuckled softly, but it really did sound weary.  “I’ll keep that in mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I nodded as  I shook my clothes on my body. The  heater had already pretty much dried them just from waiting for Anna-chan. “Well, the sky  cleared up, so I’ll just get going now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She stood  up, seeing me to the door. I couldn’t  help but feel a sense of loss… as if we were a couple that was breaking up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But that  was absurd. She had a fiancée and I had…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…A door  shut in my face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  apartment number burned itself into my memory.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I left the  hotel building behind, opting to walk without the presence of Anna-chan’s luggage to bog me down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reflecting  back on our day together, I laughed at all the small things that had happened  to us, as if a stronger force were pushing us together. As if someone <em>wanted</em> us to be together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But if that  were so, why did I meet June instead of her in college?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘Because she had already  given up on you by then.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But then why did she come back  here, right before getting married?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘Because she wanted to see  you.’</em></span></p>
<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><br />
</span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I sighed up  at the clouds. This made no sense  whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘Love rarely does.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not in  love with her!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I blinked,  and then blushed, as I looked around and noticed I had said that aloud… in  front of a street full of strangers. I  coughed and sped up a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’m  not. There’s no way I could be.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘Why not?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Because  she’s a girl, for one!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘So is June.  But you still-‘</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That was nothing serious. It was just… college experimenting.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘If you had been in the mind to experiment,  Anna-chan would have been just as open to it.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I snorted at myself. If I had gone to Anna-chan  to ‘experiment’ she would have put us down for marriage in Holland  in ten seconds flat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘Do you hate the thought of marrying her so  much? Just because  she’s a girl?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Well… I don’t <em>hate</em> it so much  as I…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘Would you rather marry Yoshitaka?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hell no!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I gulped,  turning up my collar as I hurried even more down the street. I had to stop doing that…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘So you hate Anna-chan  less than Yoshitaka?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Of course I do, Anna-chan’s my friend…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘But she’s a girl. Didn’t you hate her because she was a girl?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But Yoshitaka’s not even a <em>guy. </em>He’s more like a… a… swine with  pearl ears!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘But you still insist on being with  him. Does that make you a rich farmer?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I scoffed  at the idea of being rich. He will never  give me anything that will make me feel anything but dirty, let alone rich.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘How does Anna-chan  make you feel then? On  a normal basis?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Dependable… like if I came home  to her she would pounce on me without fail…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘You want her devotion?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I startled myself out of it when  I realized I was already at the mansion gate.  My mind was playing tricks on me.  It won’t work. She’s devoted to  Kasumi now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘But that means at one point, she was  devoted to you. Do you miss that?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As I stepped through the door, Pochi ran up and tackled me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As Mitsuki came running in to call Pochi  off, I sighed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It’s not  her devotion that I missed. She wasn’t  that different from Pochi here.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘Then what is it? You told her you missed her. Why?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mitsuki  asked how my outing was. I just nodded  and went to take a bath. Of course she  would follow me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I don’t  know why I missed her. I just felt kind  of empty without her perkiness around.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘What makes her perkiness different from  anyone else you live with? Mitsuki? Yoshitaka? Even Pochi?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I undressed and poured hot water  over me before starting to lather. I  don’t know. She was just… different.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘Because she loved you?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nee-chan,  want me to wash your back?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked  over my shoulder at her and laughed before nodding. “Please.  I’ll wash yours, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No… I know  the others love me, too… it isn’t that…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was  distinctly reminded of my conversation with June not long ago. I hadn’t gotten anywhere since then.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘Absolutely nothing that happened today made  you realize your love for Anna-chan?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’m not in love with her, dammit! Stop implying that I am!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘Denial is the first step to acceptance.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Who decided  that that was the truth in the first place?!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘…You did.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…What?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nee-chan… are you all right? You’re getting tense…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m fine…  Just… stressed…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘You don’t feel the impulse to hug her and  never let go?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Of course not. She’s just a friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘Then why didn’t you let her go during the  movie?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I… what?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘You don’t remember watching the actors on  the screen kiss… imagining that it was you and Anna-chan  up there?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I never did any such thing! I…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘That’s why you were so stiff… and you  refused to look at her the whole time… wasn’t it.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That was because I was paying  attention to the movie! The plot!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘Then what </em>was<em> the plot of the story?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Um… Uh…  there were monsters… and chainsaws… and a lot of blood…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘And messy kisses…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I wasn’t paying attention to  that part!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘Only because your dreams are  so vivid that you didn’t need to pay the movie much mind.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shut up! Shut up! That’s <em>not</em> what happened!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Deaf to Mitsuki’s shouts, I ran and dived headfirst into the hot  bath.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘Why are you so scared of your own  feelings? No one will fault you for  having them…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I shivered even as I soaked in  the hot water.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  remembered June’s question. <em>“Who do you love?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘What makes Anna-chan  so different from the others that love you?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As I felt Mitsuki’s  hand on my shoulder, asking why I bolted like that, I sincerely felt like I  wanted to cry.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Resting my  exhausted head on Mitsuki’s shoulder, I finally put  an answer to everyone’s questions.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because…  back then… she was the only one I hated myself for loving like I did.”</span></p>
