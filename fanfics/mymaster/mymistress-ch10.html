<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Izumi-san.”</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked  up, blushed, and looked away. “H-hey.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mitsuki looked between us and grinned. In a loud voice she announced, “Well  then! I’m going to go outside and feed Pochi. Come on, Reira-chan, you come, too!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I stared at  her retreating back, horrified. <em>‘That little conniving…’</em> In two minutes flat, my younger sister had  managed to drag the still working Reira-chan outside,  the door closing with finality.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anna sat  down on the couch, on the opposite end that I was. I glanced over, and noticed she was blushing a little too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So…” I gulped.  “About yesterday…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She tried  to laugh nervously, and couldn’t even get that out right. “Kasumi… has always been rather decisive…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She… She  would have been good for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anna  continued to look down at her lap.  “She’ll be good for anyone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was hard  to argue with that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The silence  grew.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anna-chan cleared her throat.  “So, um, what do you want to do today?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-you’re  the visitor. You can choose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you’re  the ‘hostess’. I don’t know any of the…  new things to do around here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should  have visited more often then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um… yeah. Sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kasumi was  right.” She looked up at me, and I  attempted a humored smile. “You  apologize too much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, sor- I mean… she’s right about a lot of things. She rarely misunderstands.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah… I  figured. I mean… with the shower thing  and all… I know I would have assumed the worst.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anna  laughed nervously. “Well, the ‘worst’  happened anyway, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I blushed  more and tightened my grip on my skirt.  “Yeah… I guess it did.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">More  silence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Taking a  deep, calming breath, I stood up, turning to her only when I could do so with a  smile. “Well, no use just sitting here  dwelling on it, right? Let’s… um…oh,  okay, how about we alternate picking things to do? Today’s Sunday so… I’m free all day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anna stood  up as well, and I had to fight back the urge to retreat. “That sounds good. And if we started from  yesterday… We met at the café, you chose the lingerie shop, I chose the movie, hum… I chose my place and then you chose  to meet here… I guess to be fair, it would be your turn  to choose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I cursed,  not having thought of anything yet. I’d  been hoping the dice had fallen on her.  Well, fine. I said I wanted to  make up the past incidents to her, so I guess I would just have find ways to do  it in stride. I already made up for the  bra-throwing incident, giving her my favorite piece of lingerie. Now…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I walked  over to the window, verifying that it looked like a good day. “Let’s take a walk around the mansion  grounds. Did you bring a camera?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A camera?” The  nervous anxiety seemed to break at that, and a slow, genuine smile sprouted  onto her face. “I did, actually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I turned  and smiled at her again, taking her hand as we headed for the door. “Come on then, let’s see how long I last  before I fall into that infernal river/creek again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My record  was apparently twenty seconds, because almost as soon as I neared the river, Pochi got away from Mitsuki and  tackled me… straight into the water. At  least I managed to let go of Anna-chan first, so she  wouldn’t share the same fate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stupid Pochi…” I sighed,  even as I pet his reptilian hand. I  found that the more I stopped running, the more content he was to be obedient  after he had chomped on me once.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was  surprised when I saw a flash of a camera.  Looking up at Anna-chan, I was doubly  surprised when she handed the camera to Mitsuki and  set down her purse before joining me in the water.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was 24, a  perfectly well aged adult… but I squealed when she squirted water into my  face. For once, I was glad that  Yoshitaka was rich, and somehow managed to keep this creek well purified.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As I  launched a counterattack, hardly even noticing the second camera flash, I felt  a more natural smile appear on my face, a reflection of Anna’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come on, Pochi, help me out!”  I stared as Anna enlisted Pochi’s help. “The more soaked she gets, the more  see-through her clothes get!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“H-h-hey!! Wait a min-“ I shielded my face with my arms as Pochi eagerly turned and whacked the water with his tail,  sending a torrent of water onto me. “No  fair!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anna giggled,  that is, until I unleashed a large counterstrike. I may not have a tail, but I wasn’t about to  lose out on a swimming bout.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That said,  about half an hour later I’d sneezed for about the third time. She called off Pochi  when I finally surrendered. As she  helped me out, our wet bodies disturbingly close with our clothes positively  soaked to the bone, she whispered into my ear, “You know what this means, don’t  you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked at  her warily. “What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As Reira offered us dry towels and a new set of clothes  (probably at Mitsuki’s instruction), Anna answered,  “I choose the penalty. Since you lost.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We never  agreed on that!” Flustered, I pulled  away a little so I could accept the towel.  It felt cold despite the warm sun after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure we  did.” Anna grinned as she also started  to dry off. “Back inside, remember? It’s my turn after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not  fair! I said take a walk around the grounds!  We only made it to the creek!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She blinked  at me. “Izumi… you really didn’t  notice?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“N-notice what?” I  hated it when someone else noticed something I didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mitsuki informed me, “You ended up swimming along the creek  all the way around the mansion, Nee-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was at a  loss for words. Finally, remembering my  private oath to make it up to her, I took a deep breath and released it with a  tentative smile. “What do you want me to  do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Strip in  front of me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“W-what?!” I  instinctively covered my chest with my arms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anna  laughed at my reaction, taking the bundle of clothes from Reira  and nudging me towards the bridge that went over the creek. “It’s not  so bad. You have to strip anyway, right? To change clothes? I do too,  so it’s not like you’ll be alone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I frowned,  not quite understanding. “If you have to  do it too, then what makes it a loser’s penalty?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She hugged  me from behind, and I blushed as I felt her more than ever. “Because either way, I come  out the winner.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As we  stopped at the bridge, I frowned. “Out  here? In the open?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s a  lingerie model so afraid of? See, Pochi’s all the way over there with Reira  and Mitsuki-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I felt the  overwhelming sense of being tricked into lowering my guard. It happened anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I sighed,  plopping down cross-legged on the wood.  “Oh all right… But grope me and  you’re dead, got it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anna  chuckled. “For now…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked at  her, calmly drying out her hair, though her eyes were casually focused on  me. She seemed to understand that I was  still embarrassed, going into uncharted territory, but was willing to nudge our  relationship along little by little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Well, okay,  this wasn’t exactly ‘little’… it was more like… service. I sighed, starting to unbutton my damp  blouse. Why I hadn’t thought to change  before leaving the mansion is beyond me…  You would think all those years of doing the laundry would have taught  me that nice clothes and outdoor walks never computed correctly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I placed  the towel over my shoulders like a cloak when I was down to my bra. I glanced over at her, nervous, and stopped  cold in my tracks.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was  mirroring me. She was down to her bra,  too, at least on the top half. She  grinned innocently at me, one hand twisted back, ready to unfasten at my whim.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I blushed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And looked  around, making sure no one else was looking.  When I looked back, I swear Anna had somehow scooted closer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Licking my  lips nervously, I quickly unfastened, only to tighten the towel around me. With the intensity that Anna seemed to be  watching me, however, I’m sure she got in a good look anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was able  to after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I dried off  my top half as much as I could, sure that my face was beet red from being nude  underneath a single towel. I grabbed the  new bikini top Mitsuki had set out for me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I blushed  more when I realized that Anna was also putting on one of mine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My heart  had never beaten so quickly before. Not  even in the days of Alicia teaching me my sadistic side.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Was it  because we were outside?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or because Anna was watching me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or was it  because of that smile she had on as she slipped on a light tank top?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I shook my  head, drying my hair and neck a little more before donning the blue-jeans  half-jacket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Now for the  bottom half… I dried from the knees down, if only to stall for time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then… it  wasn’t until Anna had grinned victoriously after I had shed the skirt and wet  panties to put on the new ones that I realized what she had.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Well, I  realized it when she mimicked me one last time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Towel  covering over the top didn’t really do much with your knees bent… and the  voyeur sitting right in front of you.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I fell  forward, exhausted, as I finally allowed myself to throw aside the towel. She caught me with her chest, her arms folded  around me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was  something overwhelmingly soft about her manner and actions as she bent down and  kissed my forehead and whispered…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And for the  first time, I truly acknowledged outloud, “No. Thank <em>you</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For loving me… and encouraging me… and never making me feel alone in a  crowded world.</span></p>
