<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I stared at  her, more embarrassed than anything. I  could have chalked it up to an accident, her nose brushing against me as she  lifted her head, but the way she cowered now, as if expecting to be hit… there  was no doubt about it. But being far  enough away to see her cowering… I wondered what I’d been doing all these  years… all the mean things… brought on by stupid instincts… that had left our  relationship like this.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I had to  make it up to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Gingerly, I  stood up, brushing my skirt off as I smiled and extended a hand to her. She seemed surprised by the gesture, but  slowly accepted the offer. I took one  moderately long look at her, and nodded.  “It looks good on you. Does it  fit right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She seemed  to have lost her voice for a moment, but she whispered, looking down at  herself, “Yes. Very  well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I prepared  to leave, give her some space. “Sorry for  barging in like that. You’re alright,  aren’t you?” She gave me the slightest of nods.  “I’ll wait outside then. Be  careful, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I turned  away so that she wouldn’t see my guilt, when she looked up at me with such  surprise, as if I could never feel concerned about her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Was I  really so cruel to her?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Our time  apart was surprisingly short, though she didn’t seem to rush to pay for the  piece and have it packaged. I hardly had  any time to think before she was beside me again. Shaking my head, I smiled, “What do you want  to do now? Since you’re in town and I’m  free.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As we  walked out the store, she gave me an inquisitive look, as if debating whether I  could take whatever was on her mind.  What she finally voiced was, “I haven’t seen a Japanese movie for a long  time. Are there any good ones in the  theaters right now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It didn’t  even occur to me then that I was being swept into a dating setup. But then, much of our problems sprouted from  my thoughtlessness. Playing the hostess,  I earnestly considered the question. “I  heard the new romance-thriller one was pretty good… Rated R  for graphic scenes. Think you can  stomach that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smiled,  as if something in the back of her mind had come up to amuse her. “If I’m with good company…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I scratched  my cheek gingerly before throwing caution to the wind and grabbing her hand  before hurrying down the street. “Let’s  go check the times then. The complex has  grown since you were last in town.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As it  turned out, we were more than an hour and a half early for the next showing, so  we decided to look around the nearby shops before going in to wait to be  seated.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I asked her  what she’d been doing since we last saw each other, and at first, she simply  glazed over the timeline of events- college… met Kasumi… moved to Holland…  settled down as an OL until she could find something better…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In all  honesty, mine was much the same- local college during which I stayed at the  mansion, got lassoed into modeling, met June…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It startled  me when she softly verified, “You really aren’t… closely involved with anyone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I thought  about June, but we were just close friends and ex-roommates now. Yoshitaka was nothing more than a  pain-in-the-back landlord. I smiled and  shook my head. “Nope,  not me. Actually, I think you’re the only one I know who has plans to  tie the knot. Not that that’s a bad  thing,” I added quickly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She laughed  at that, murmuring, “Did I tell you?  Kasumi was the one that ‘proposed’ to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I laughed,  not out of malice, but out of a nervous jitter that made me want to believe  that everything was a joke. Though… I really didn’t know what I was nervous about. It was just Anna-chan  after all. “What’s she like? Is she a tomboy? Or…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She shook  her head. “Not really. I mean, she does prefer casual pants rather than  skirts or dresses, but on special occasions…OH!  Duh. I  have a picture, want to see?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even if I  had said no, she was already looking through her purse for said picture. So I just went along with it, leaning a  little closer so that I could see the wallet size picture.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My heart  clenched when I focused on it, but I couldn’t understand why. It felt a little like a twinge of jealousy,  but surely that must have been my lonely side thinking what it must be like to  have your special someone’s picture in your wallet to show off to whoever  wanted to see it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It wasn’t  jealousy that Anna-chan had her future wife’s picture  in there and not mine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That would  have been ridiculously nonsensical.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Really. No sense at  all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I stood up,  looking at the nearby clock tower. “We  should get going if we want good seats.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She nodded,  gathering her things again and catching up to me as I walked off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Though she  ended up paying for things to snack on, we ate most of it while waiting. Just before they opened the doors, I told her  to pick a couple of seats for us while I bought some refills.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Having once  again escaped her, I sighed heavily. I  stopped and wondered why I was so relieved to be away from her, when nothing  had gone seriously wrong since she came back.  I mean, sure, I introduced my ex as my old friend, I had a cry in the  bathroom, I touched her while she was still have undressed, I let her buy my  favorite piece that I’d personally worn countless times, I’m going to the  movies with someone who once swore we would get married in Holland one day…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">See?  Nothing happened. Nothing  at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe there <em>is</em> something to this ‘denial’ thing  people are always going on about.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I returned  to the dimly lit theater, looking around for Anna-chan. There was a group of guys huddled around in  the back, but I paid them no mind.  Stupid blokes were everywhere these days. But as I walked up and down the paths, I  couldn’t find her. I considered calling  out for her, but I wasn’t sure how loud I’d have to shout for her to hear me,  and I didn’t want to disturb the other patrons too much. As I was passing the raucous guys in the  back, however, I distinctly heard Anna-chan’s  voice. “If I wanted to hang out with  little boys, I would have come with one.  But that’s not happening anytime soon, I’m sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was  putting on a bit of a brave front, but I could hear the slightest fear  underneath the annoyance and bravado. As  I took a step closer, recognizing the back of her head, I heard the head honcho  say, “We’re <em>real</em> men. Those guys you’ve met before were just little  kiddies compared to us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So says  the one with his fly unzipped. Is that a  mark of a ‘real man’? Then I can do  without, thanks but no thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I bit back  a laugh, a little part of me wanting to see how Anna handled herself these  days, when alone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The overgrown boy puffed himself up  and dared to lean in, not even ‘correcting’ his zipper position as he breathed,  “All the better to have you suck it, my dear…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">All right, that’s it. If I stand by any longer, I’m going to be  sick. Reaching forward, I wrapped my  arms around Anna’s shoulders, speaking before she could be scared enough to  flip me over her shoulder like she looked like she might be ready to do to any  of those guys bothering her. “Excuse me,  but could you <em>kindly</em> stop trying to  force yourself on my girlfriend? I  promised my officer friend I wouldn’t beat up anymore people, but if I call him  and the ambulance afterward, I’m sure he’ll understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Most of the lesser guys started to  back off at that. Though my mind was  currently demanding against the torrent of zealous protectiveness an  explanation for the use of the word ‘girlfriend’, but I shut it up with a claim  that it was all a ruse to get them to leave us alone. Because being alone with Anna was better than  having Anna alone with a bunch of rough, stupid guys.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And no, I had no explanation for  what I thought Anna-chan and I would be doing  ‘alone’.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The main idiot wasn’t about to give  up without some fight or another though.  I frowned when I realized his loud remarks were starting to draw  attention. Perhaps the theater cops  could persecute him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I barely heard him say, “A couple  of lesbians, huh? Now I <em>know</em> neither of you have known ‘the real  deal’ before. Come on, what’s say you <em>both</em> get in on the action then? You know it’ll be ten times bet-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I hit the side of his head with my  purse. The one with a rockhard wallet.  I then pulled him closer by his collar, avoiding his stinky breath, to  inform him, “You’re not the sharpest crayon in the box, are you? Being a lesbian does not equate to ‘can’t  find a guy but wishes she had one’. It  means <em>preferring</em> to keep guys out the  picture entirely.” For the most part anyway. “Which translates to: leave us the hell alone  before I arrange to have you forcibly circumcised. <em>Then</em> we’ll see just how ‘manly’ you are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It seemed that that was enough to  make him retreat. I’ve been told that up  close, I had the sort of eyes that could scare anyone of lesser will to believe  all of the threats I strung up, and those that didn’t, soon learned that I <em>was</em> telling the truth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I guess he wasn’t so stupid in the  end after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As he backed away into his cronies,  he stuttered, “Y-you’ll pay for this one day!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Okay, scratch that. He <em>was</em> that stupid. Jerk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I waited until I saw them all exit  the theater and the door close behind them before looking down at Anna-chan. I smiled, as  if what had just happened was nothing, offering her the popcorn I somehow  hadn’t spilt. “Are you all right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She slowly nodded, as if in a daze,  as I took a seat beside her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Worried over her silence, I asked,  “Do you want to leave? That wasn’t  exactly a great way to start a movie… I shouldn’t have left you alone like  that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She quickly shook my head and  produced a smile as she got comfortable.  “No, no it’s fine. Really.” As the movie  started, she hesitantly placed her head on my shoulder. I swear I only wrapped my arm around her  waist so that she wouldn’t suddenly slip and hit her head on something. I wasn’t even sure if I heard her right when  she whispered, “You kept your word… you’re beside me now… that’s all that  matters…”</span></p>
