<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I sighed  for perhaps the fifteenth time that day, a complete bundle of nerves.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tonight is  my last chance to make amends.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It’s now or  never.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I can’t let  there be anymore misunderstandings between us.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked at  the clock. 5:46.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Dammit, I got here too early. Way too early.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We agreed  to meet at 6:30.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I fidgeted,  knowing what I was wearing underneath my casually nice pants, shirt, blazer combo. I  started to pace when I remembered who the only one I would let myself wear it,  and only it, in front of…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Flowers. Dammit, I forgot to get some flowers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe  that’ll kill time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But what if  I take too long? What if <em>she</em> ends up waiting for <em>me</em>?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Just for  some stupid flowers?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But she  might really like them…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">How much  money can I spare? I quickly  checked. I’d already paid for the  restaurant tab… and I worked out a fixed fee for the moonlit boat ride (thank  God for June’s smaller business ventures)… I would get everything out in the  open there… and then we can go to a l-lo-loooov-</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hold  on. If I gave her flowers, wouldn’t she  have to carry it everywhere? Wouldn’t  that get entirely bothersome? Especially if the flowers are expecting water…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Never mind  then. I’m better off without.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Besides, I  have a better gift than stupid flowers anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I checked  the clock again. 5:55. Dammit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I started  walking in a wide circle around the fountain, deciding to count how many times  I could <em>slowly</em> walk around before the  appointed time came.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Two…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Three…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">BAM!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ow…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I growled  at whoever I had run into, “Hey! Watch where you’re going!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why don’t <em>you</em> watch where you’re- eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  well, what do we have here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Oh no.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The rough  guys from the movie theater… it’s surprising I still recognize their mugs…  though it’s hard to forget someone quite <em>that</em> ugly…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Especially  compared to Anna…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I slapped  away his hand when he moved to touch my chin.  I didn’t have time for this.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Well, okay,  maybe I did, but I shouldn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I don’t want  my clothes to get messed up after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But looking  at them makes me want to beat them up so badly…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All alone today?  What happened to that chick of yours?  Dump you for a guy like me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I rolled my  eyes, but I wasn’t about to give him the satisfaction of knowing that I was  standing around waiting for her right now.  “Buzz off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The other  guys started to surround me. They could  always take ‘one measly girl’ couldn’t they?  As a team anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They’ll  never get girlfriends at this rate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not that I  can think of any girl that would <em>want</em> to date any of these jerks…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Girls like  you shouldn’t be hanging out so late alone, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Guys like  you shouldn’t be hanging out so long with <em>me</em>,  if they want to live another day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They didn’t  back off this time. He seemed appeared  to call my bluff. Even  though it wasn’t really a bluff.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I took my  stance. “All right, you want a  fight? Come and get it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We don’t  want a fight,” he continued to leer at me as they all drew closer. “We just want to have some <em>fun</em> with you. In replacement for the  other day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I spun and  kicked him in the jaw. He went down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But not for the count.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Stupid stubborn idiot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They all  charged, and I started fighting back.  After all the years of enduring Yoshitaka and fending him off, I had  learned to expend maximum damage on minimal energy spent.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Well, as  much as could be expected, considering I never really bothered with taking  classes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Still, I  was breathing hard and my clothes had gotten messed up by the time they finally  turned tail and ran. Why?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Because a policeman had finally come around to check up on things.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He asked if  I was the victim or the assailant.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I told him,  as politely as I could, that I was whichever one wouldn’t have me taken away to  the police station, because I was waiting for somebody.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He asked me  if I always did things like this while waiting.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I told him  point blank, of course not.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He nodded,  bowed a little, told me to be careful, and walked away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Stupid almost-incompetent baka.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Izumi…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I slowly  spun around, and my eyes found Anna. I  smiled and waved her over.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She looked  worried.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked  down at my semi-beaten up, sweaty state, and suddenly she was right next to me,  a handkerchief to my brow, wiping away like a doting mother… or  girlfriend. I smiled and touched her  elbow, leading us over to the edge of the fountain. I felt like sitting.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  happened?” She frowned, looking at me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I tried to  smile. “It’s nothing. I just got into a little scuffle with some  neighborhood wannabe yakuzas.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you  really all right? Did they hurt you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not too  badly,” I remarked, trying to be as honest as possible. “And yes, I’ll be all right. Don’t worry.  Just… Is my hair all messed up?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.” She  smiled and reached into her purse, pulling out a thin comb. Wetting said comb in the fountain water, she  proceeded to neaten my hair back out. As  she finished, she whispered, “I’ve always envied you for your hair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I raised an  eyebrow. “Why? I like you with your own natural hair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She bit her  lip, as if she wanted to comment, but eventually shook her head. Standing back up, she smiled. “Shall we go?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I nodded,  placing one hand in my pocket to check that it still had its contents, and  offering her the other. Anna smiled as  she took it. “Let’s go then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fifteen  minutes later, we’d found the restaurant, been seated, and received our menus.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know,  I’ve been thinking this since before but…”  Anna looked up at me worriedly, “This place is really expensive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  worry about it,” I smiled across the table to her. “Eat as much as you want. I’ve been saving up a bit too much; I can  afford to spend some more. Besides, it’s  just the two of us, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She seemed  hesitant, so I offered her another incentive.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Unless you’d like to order for one and share?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She seemed  to really like that idea.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So when the  waiter returned, we ordered one large main dish and a couple of assorted small  dishes we wanted to try. We’d considered  getting the spaghetti and meatballs, but it was a little impractical since real  life wasn’t like Lady and the Tramp. Not  really anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Still, we  scooted a fair bit closer before our food arrived.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There were  quite a few “say ‘ah’” moments.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not that I  minded. Either giving or receiving.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Much better  than unleashing an embarrassing food fight.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or gagging  over each other’s cooking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We talked  and laughed and enjoyed each other’s company, reliving our last two weeks  together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It’s been a  schweet two weeks…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I really  have to buy Kasumi a thank-you birthday gift.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anna  murmured appreciatively about the surrounding nature as we walked through the  park to the boat rides.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">By the  light of the full moon, I saw her blush a little as I stepped onto the boat and  then helped her in. As I started rowing,  my mouth clammed up, as if it knew what was about to happen. Or what I would try to make happen.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anna-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Izumi-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I bit my  tongue as we both looked away. I quietly  told her she could go first. She didn’t  object.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Izumi… I…  I want to thank you for these… these last two weeks. They’ve meant the world to me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I frowned,  something wasn’t right. Surely she  wasn’t suggesting…? I stopped rowing, as  we were drifting in the middle of the lake now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know  you’re just doing it out of guilt… because of our past together… but it’s  okay. I don’t care-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop.” I crawled  over to her side of the boat, careful to not make it tip over, even though it  rocked a bit. “Stop it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Izumi…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  reached  up and wrapped my arms around her. She  quickly put her hands behind herself so we wouldn’t fall over  completely. I whispered into her ear. “It’s not guilt. It’s not… guilt.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Izumi you  don’t have to-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!” I took a deep calming breath, slipping a bit  backwards as she lay beneath me on the floor of the boat. I smiled softly. These misunderstandings had to be cleared  up. “Anna… Listen to me. It’s true that I have wanted to make up the  past with you… but I always want you to know… I never disliked you, Anna. Not even since the day we first met.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She didn’t  speak now, letting my clammed up mouth loosen freely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry  for hitting you in those days… it wasn’t your fault. Yoshitaka just…  sensitized me to being  molested. Him and Pochi. I wish  we had met under better circumstances, without him in the picture…” I  laughed softly to myself. “Then again, it’s because of him that we met  and ended up living together, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smiled  encouragingly at me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry…  for leading you on in those days… it’s not that I wanted to use your feelings  for me… so much as… something inside me wanted to see you happy, wanted to  please you, wanted to be the only one in your eyes. That side of me… convinced me to do the  things I did… and then the other side cut off the initial intentions and… I  just made of mess of things. I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I took a  deep breath and continued, “I’ve never known how to act around you, Anna. I didn’t want to give you the wrong  impression, when I wasn’t even completely sure of how I felt. Was it wrong to simply do nothing and accept  your feelings?” I laughed a little. “Even my mom said she would approve of us if  we ever got together… that made it <em>definitely</em> seem that something was off about it… so I didn’t want to touch it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Licking my  lips, I caught my breath and started again.  “I don’t know why you liked me. Or still like me. I’m a weak person, even if I can do manual  labor like an ox if forced to. I’ve  never known what I wanted out of life, and I’m not sure if I know even now. But… I do know  this…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I saw the  moonlight reflected in her eyes as she looked up at me, and I smiled as I  reached into my pocket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love  you, Anna. With all my  heart. You aren’t just my bright  morning star anymore, but my other half, my soulmate. I offer to you, not just my blood, sweat, and  tears, but my heart, my love, my life.  No matter what anyone else may say, I don’t want to just remain by your  side forever anymore. Karauchi Anna…” I  paused, smiling as I flipped open the box between us. “Will you marry me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She didn’t  speak for several moments, her eyes glued to the ring within the box. I was a little worried when tears started to  trickle out of her eyes, but her whisper saved me. “You’re not… you’re not just saying it to say  it this time… right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I mean it,  Anna, all of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You aren’t  going to suddenly turn around blushing and say it was all a cruel… cruel  trick?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, Anna.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You aren’t  going to ask me to get back together with Kasumi or something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“N-“ I paused, and then smiled, shaking my head. “I wouldn’t be asking you if I wasn’t aware  you still had a choice in the matter, Anna.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Still she hesitated, as if it was so unbelievable, even after our two  week together, that I could ever do something like this ‘for real’. But I waited patiently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her hands  closed around the box. Her eyes were  also closed as the tears started flowing faster. But she didn’t sob. “Even after all this time… I guess it’s still  true. It can only be you, Izumi. If you’ll have me, I would love to marry you…  again and again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  let’s hope it goes well the first time, all right?” I smiled teasingly as I leaned down to kiss  away her tears, my hand fumbling to help her to take out the ring and put in on  her finger. It fit perfectly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Just like  the two of us.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The boat  was crowded, our adult bodies not having a lot of room to move, but under the  moonlight… on the secluded lake… we showed God alone that we had no need for  society’s opinions, love hotels, or boys.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If God was  watching us… the only thing I can think to tell him is… keep his eyes to  himself, because Anna was mine now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And I wouldn’t  let her run away this time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I won’t let  myself run away either.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Because  Anna finally showed me what I had been looking for, what I had always wanted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Someone whose love for me was worth returning.</span></p>
