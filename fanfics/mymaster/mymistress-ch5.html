<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The next  half an hour passed by slowly. I was a bit worried when June-san went  to go  check on Izumi-san, and even more worried when I saw the redness of  Izumi-san’s eyes when she returned, but I sensed that it was not  something she wanted me to dwell on.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Izumi-san’s Boss left us to talk while she went around making  sure everything was going well in the store itself as it was still business  hours.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  apparently satisfying her desire to talk to Izumi-san, June-san left us to our  own devices, saying that she was going to go shop around for a souvenir and go  home for the day, since she had some things to do that she’d been  procrastinating long enough.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She gently,  easily refused Izumi-san’s offer to be given her  discount. Then she whispered something  in Izumi-san’s ear that made the recipient blush.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">June-san  left soon after that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then it was  just the two of us again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Silence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then,  almost  suddenly, Izumi-san stood up and extended a hand to me. “Want to see my  collection now? Last year, Boss set aside a corner of the  store for things that I had modeled.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I felt my  eyes widen. “You have that much?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She laughed  it off, tugging me up as I started to rise.  “Let’s look before you say anything about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When I did  see it, I did think that. It was a  collection that would have made Yoshitaka-san quite proud. I wasn’t sure if I should be bothered by that  or not, so I simply stepped forward from where she stopped and began looking at  them more carefully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Since I was  already here, I didn’t bother to stop imagining Izumi-san posing in every piece  that I touched.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I did stop  when I realized I was comparing how I would look in the same piece beside her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Any scene  that involved her, me, and a bed was definitely too dangerous to think about.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kasumi…  Kasumi is the one I’m marrying… not her…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anna-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I jerked at  the call, accidentally grabbing something out of the rack. When I looked at it, I realized it was a  rather good piece.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You like  that one?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I nodded  limply, using my free hand to trace the small frills, the delicate laces…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Like the delicious curves of her body…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I blinked hard, trying to rid  myself of those thoughts. Maybe I should  stop while I’m ahead… was I ever really ahead?  I feel like I’ve been going back in time…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Back to the sweet scent of her bed… of her…  even though I knew I couldn’t touch her… when she was so very close…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I had to get out of there. There were just too many things that could  set me off in this shop. No. I glanced at Izumi-san. There were too many things going through my  mind when I was with her at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say… Anna-chan… I wanted to ask this before but it’s kind of  embarrassing…” She scratched her cheek as she looked down at the piece I’d  chosen. “What are your three sizes now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Blood  rushed to my cheeks as another unbidden thought came to mind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Of her measuring me personally… her arms  wrapped around… so very close to…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I tried to laugh through my  sweat and told her point blank.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She seemed  amazed. “You’re kidding… we really are  almost the exact same then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I smiled a  little at that. “I had a bit of a growth  spurt…” That was a bit of an  overstatement, considering that the last time I’d told her my sizes was more  than seven years ago. I’d be heartstricken if I hadn’t grown since then.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was  just passing by me to reach for something behind my shoulder, but the movement  left her lips right at my ear as she whispered, “I can see that. This piece is actually my favorite… but I  think it might actually look better on you than me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I turned to  face her, ready to protest, but she was typing something into a calculator on  the wall. What a calculator was doing  there, hidden by clothing, was beyond me.  Personnel only access?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smiled  at me as if she had never said anything, had never made my heart skip a mile a  minute for just one second. She told me  the price.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I thought  it was absurd. So  absurd that I forgot about the butterflies in my stomach enough to demand a  recount. “That’s more than half  of any price we’ve ever paid for anything like this! And it’s such good quality…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  grinned, giving me a wink. The  butterflies came back to tickle my insides.  “Why do you think I said I didn’t know what to do with it all? I bring in customers- I get extremely good  deals. On <em>top</em> of my paychecks.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>On top of a desk, on top of her… pulling off  the lingerie little by little…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I wanted to slam my head into a  wall. At least then I wouldn’t have to  explain my tendency towards nose bleeds.  Though then I would have to explain hitting my head against the wall in  the first place. I tried to smile. “The least I can do is pay  for it myself then. You’re practically  giving it to me as it is…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She didn’t  argue, didn’t insist that she pay for it “on the house”. But of course she wouldn’t. If she pulled favors like <em>that</em>, who knew when they would go out of  business?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Though this  place seemed to be flourishing… despite not being a “rush hour” period of the  day…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She stopped  again before we reached the register.  Turning to me, I saw her blush again.  She would have a stroke at this rate.  Maybe she has a fever? “I almost  forgot. Don’t you want to try it on  before you buy it? See how it looks on  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Only if you join me…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> Dammit  shut up already!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I sighed  and nodded. “Where are the fitting rooms  then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The curtain  closed before I could tell what was happening.  She would wait outside, keeping guard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A chill  went through me as I realized that only a thin curtain separated her from my  bare body… while I was changing at least.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I want her to see me… all of me… hiding  nothing…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The walls  here were close enough to hit my head against.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I hadn’t  realized I’d actually hit myself until I was sprawled on the floor, still  half-naked, with Izumi-san poking her head in and asking if I was alright.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somewhere  in the course of the last few hours, I think I became completely numb to embarrassment. Simply given up on hiding  it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or rather,  I should say, given up on not taking a chance.  That was what these two weeks were supposed to be for, after all. To get it out of my system.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Wincing, I  held my head with one hand and adjusted the about-to-be-bought lingerie piece,  arranging it so that it remained snug against my skin. It fit perfectly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I let my  mind believe that this was the exact same piece that Izumi had modeled. <em>Indirect  skinship…?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anna-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Realizing I  hadn’t answered her, I smiled reassuringly.  “I just slipped. I’m fine.” But then I tried to get up… and couldn’t. Nerves, perhaps?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was  still there. No, she had come in  completely, despite the room being as small as it was. She bent down next to me, her hands  automatically going to my head, touching me… seeing if it hurt…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It hurt  that her breasts were right in front of my eyes, literally a short few inches  from my face, and I couldn’t pay homage to them…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Oh if I could just give them both one little  kiss each…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">All of a sudden, Izumi-san  squealed, throwing herself backward and hitting her own head against the bench  there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As I licked  my lips unconsciously, something deep inside me told me I might have just  crossed a line without realizing it…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was  something in the way she folded her arms over her chest, hugging herself, that  made me repeat, “Sorry… I slipped.”</span></p>
