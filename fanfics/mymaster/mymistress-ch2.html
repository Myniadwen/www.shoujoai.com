<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I jumped,  nearly dropping the pile of dishes I was carrying, as my cell phone went off  yet again. Growling, I put the dishes in  the sink, prepared to give the person some lip once I flipped open my phone…</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“HEY y-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The dull  tone met my ears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dammit! That’s the  fifth time <em>this morning</em>!” Like all the times before, I tried to check  the number, but it was hidden. I snapped  the phone closed, putting it back in my apron as I returned to the dishes. Though I knew no one was home to hear me, I  mumbled, “If you’re stalking me, don’t be so obvious about it, I mean <em>seriously. </em>Prank calls should only go so far.  And if I find out it’s someone I know and they’re getting a kick out of  ticking me off…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I wrung out  the sponge, accidentally tearing it in half, like I wanted to do to whoever kept  making my phone vibrate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And damn  that Yoshitaka for making this material so thin... and the apron pockets so  close to…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I shook my  head, trying to clear my thoughts. These  dishes probably cost some eighteen thousand yen each or something. If I broke any… especially when I was  technically just doing this for room and board…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There  should be a limit to how long a landlord can act stupid and petty…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nee-chan? Where are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked up  at the familiar voice, coming from far, far down the hall most likely. Pressing the intercom button with a soapy  finger, I answered, “Ah, Mitsuki? I’m in the kitchen. Washing dishes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A few  minutes later, I heard Mitsuki enter the room. “Reira-chan can  handle this much, can’t she? When Goshujin-sama isn’t home.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t call  him that!” I winced as I jerked my hand  right off the plate and against the side of the sink in the process of whipping  around to glare at my sister. “Don’t…  He’s not our master anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mitsuki grinned as she propped her elbows on the counter,  seemingly content to watch me. “But  you’re still doing maid work.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Force of habit!” I  growled, trying to rein in my temper some.  “It’s mindless work. And Reira-chan went out to bring back some groceries. We ran out of milk, among other things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ehhhh… So that’s how it is, hmm…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I glared  half-heartedly at her. She had that  smile on her face again. That ‘let’s make things more interesting by making life hard on my  older sister’ smile. I sighed,  already giving into her whims. “What are  you thinking?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yoshitaka-kun  is in Kyoto on business, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He told  you to watch the house while he ‘bonded’ with Emi-chan,  right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I nearly  broke the dish I was holding. “Yes. What’s your point?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You aren’t  really doing anything today, are you. For your other job as an  idol.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not an  idol anymore. I’m a… a…” I stopped and looked at her, already knowing  she was grinning as she watched my cheeks grow redder. “Argh!  You know! You’re my manager after all!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m still  amazed you can’t even say what your occupation is, after three years working at  it… What do you tell people on the streets?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I <em>don’t</em> tell people on the streets!” I knew my face was bright red by now, but I  plowed on. “That’s the thing with  enduring Yoshitaka for so long- I can walk the walk but I can’t talk the talk.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t it  normally the other way around?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s all his fault! He  reverses reality to his own liking!” I  trailed off, grumbling curses about whatever else  chose to come to mind then.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After a few  minutes passed in silence, I blinked out of my trance and looked at Mitsuki. She had  brought out her laptop and pulled up some documents and pictures. I leaned over, knowing but hoping against all  odds that I was wrong, and looked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was  right. I hate being right.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, Nee-chan, look! Your website popularity went up again! Isn’t it gre-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s NOT  great!” Fully dissolving into a puddle  of embarrassment as I finished washing the last dish, I grumbled, “It’s one  thing to wear it and get paid for it; it’s another to know just how many  perverts like watching me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Thinking of  being watched reminded me of the prank calls.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, Mitsuki?” I took out my phone and held it out to  her. “I’ve been getting these really  annoying calls all morning. But the caller  ID won’t work. Could you figure out who  it is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I could…” Mitsuki looked at the phone in my hand, and I could just  see the balance in her head weighing the odds of whether or not it was fun  enough to be worth her time. Eventually  deciding it was, she took the phone and started playing with it. “Okay, let’s see what we have here…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Leaving it  to her, I decided to dry the dishes as well and put them away. <em>God,  why am I so bored?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somewhere  high above, on a fluffy pink cloud, Pochi’s Godfather  and hamster mistress played cricket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nee-chan, you were sent a text message from probably the same  person. Want me to read it to you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked  up, seeing that she had already read it.  Sighing, I nodded. “Better than hanging up on me at least. Go for it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“’No matter  what anyone else says, I want to be by your side. Can we meet at the café across from your  lingerie shop?’”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How many times do I have to say it?! It’s not MY shop!” <em>But  that first part sounds familiar… where have I heard it before?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mitsuki giggled as I huffed, turning away. <em>She </em>would<em> find this amusing… </em>“Want me to accept?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?! Why?!” There is no one in their right mind who would  meet their stalker so abruptly like this.  Especially after such a creepy text message. <em>Do they  watch me while I work…?</em> I shuddered  at the thought. “I don’t want to pummel  a complete stranger in a public place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, so you  want the stalker to come here? Okay,  sending-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wait!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mitsuki giggled. “Already sent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I groaned,  cursing Mitsuki’s ability to text at the speed of  light. At least the dishes were away  now. No more chances to break things.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw,  they’re afraid of coming to the mansion… and they’d like to take you out for a  meal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t  take food from strangers.” <em>Why on Earth would I have ever needed to, with  Yoshitaka paying for all the food expenses here?</em> I left the kitchen to go back to my room, and  Mitsuki followed me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They  insist they’re not a stranger. Just… embarrassed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Name?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mitsuki grinned as she sat on the bed. “What fun would it be if I told you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you  already know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I knew  even before you asked me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you’re  calling me stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When have  I <em>ever</em> called you stupid, Nee-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I chose not  to answer that. Sighing, I muttered, “Mitsuki, do you think I should see them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It might  be fun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I rolled my  eyes. “That’s <em>not</em> what I asked.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  what I heard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe if I  was silent long enough, she would answer me honestly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, she  says it’s important. You shouldn’t keep  her waiting then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She…?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One person,  one blast from the past memory, jolted me up to a sitting position.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It can’t be…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I stared at  Mitsuki, and she was still grinning at me. I grabbed the phone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But I </em>have<em> her number… I was sure I put it in…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The screen  was blank. I checked the text inbox. None received, none sent.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I glared at  Mitsuki. <em>She’s  been toying with me the whole time…?!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She grinned  at me. One word. “Gotcha.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I nearly  threw my phone at her, but that would have hurt. I couldn’t hurt my little sister, no matter <em>how</em> annoying she could get. So I threw my pillow at her instead. She caught it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I  wasn’t lying about knowing who it was or knowing they needed to talk to you,  Nee-chan.  Maybe if you go to the café, you’ll find them anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why would  they- she be at the café?” <em>What </em>is<em> that girl doing these days anyway…?  Now that I think about it… I haven’t heard from her in a while now…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mitsuki just continued to grin. I won’t be blamed if it freezes that  way. “Even if you don’t, isn’t it a nice  day to go for a walk to the café?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked  out the window instinctively. It <em>was</em> a nice day…“But that doesn’t mean I want to meet my stalker!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mitsuki  suddenly whipped out a sheet from her bag. “Would you feel better if I  told you you were requested at the shop for later this afternoon…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I grabbed  the sheet, looking over the fax. After  the stunt she had just pulled, I wasn’t sure if <em>this</em> wasn’t a hoax too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not  kidding, this time, Nee-chan.” But she was still grinning a little. “They said a frequent shopper that kept missing  you wanted to see you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The stalker?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  shrugged, closing her eyes briefly in the motion. “I doubt they’d know the difference, Nee-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reluctantly,  I let the sheet fall to the bed and stood up.  “Fine.  You coming?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mitsuki only grinned brighter. “I’ll keep an eye on Reira-chan  after she comes back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In other  words, you’re planning on me bumping into my stalker alone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At least  it’s not a dark alley.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks. That makes me feel <em>so</em> much better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As I sifted  through my wardrobe, trying to find things Yoshitaka <em>hadn’t</em> made perversely short, Mitsuki  suggested, “If you dress like it’s a date, she might even throw in a free  movie.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If there  was another pillow nearby, I would have thrown that at her, too. “I have no interest in dating a female  stalker!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, so a  male stalker is fine?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then you  prefer female stalkers?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No! I  don’t prefer <em>any</em> stalkers!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But it’s  fine, if it’s female then, as long as they aren’t stalkers?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop  twisting my words around!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Why does this feel so familiar…?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  eventually did choose something resembling date clothing. But only because there was nothing else that  fit the weather and was moderately flattering without being too revealing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mitsuki wished me luck as I left the mansion, and secretly  I wondered what way she meant for me to be lucky in. She wasn’t a thirteen year old innocent  anymore after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But… is it really her? I haven’t seen her in so long…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I smiled,  not truly aware of why.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It’d be nice to see her… maybe, after this, I’ll give her a call.  I’ve been so busy lately it kept slipping my mind…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The phone  remained still the entire trip to the nearby café. It even stayed silent as I ordered some light  sandwiches and some tea.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Just to be  safe, I set the phone on the table in front of me. Away from my body.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was  sipping my tea when it finally went off, startling me even worse than before in  my moment of lowered defenses.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’d  forgotten how horribly loud vibrating phones sounded on solid surfaces.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Still, I  gingerly picked it up, trying to keep my voice calm. Maybe the reason they’d been scared off  before was because I sounded mad. Well,  not sounded. I <em>had</em> been mad.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Moshi moshi?” Keep it simple… simple…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A-ah… If  it’s all right with you, could I join you at your table?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I turned my  head every which way, trying to figure out where she was. The voice was too soft for me to clearly  recognize it, but it was definitely female.  “I… is this Anna-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The other  end went silent.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not wanting  to scare her off, I added quickly, “If it is, I don’t mind at all. Please do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“… Thank  you.” The phone went dead in my  hand. Sighing, I hung up. Looking at the mess I had made almost  spitting out the tea, I at least tried to clean up the spot nearest me with a  napkin. Stupid maid  habits.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I nearly  jumped to the point of short circuiting from lack of energy when two all too  familiar arms embraced me at seven o’clock (South-west of direction being  faced, in other words).</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My hands  unconsciously went over to cover the hands wrapped around me… and I took in  that familiar scent that I’ll never forget… but that I’ll never admit aloud to  remembering…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It </em>is<em> her…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I smiled, trying to return the  hug as best as I could. “Long time no  see, Anna-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It could  have just been me, but I swear I felt a small tear wet my shoulder right then.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A/N: And so ends a second chapter! .n.n. Little things you probably already know:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Goshujin-sama Master</span></p>
