<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Epilogue… from Kasumi’s point of view.(for  added funness of course)</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I sighed  softly, leaning against a column as I watched the planes landing outside the  airport. <em>‘She’ll be touching down soon…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I closed my  eyes, trying to mentally check that everything was in order. Like Anna-chan told  me to, I cleaned up our spare bedroom as well as the apartment in and of  itself… I can’t believe she’s bringing Izumi back with her… but… I suppose it’s  for the best… it’s just a visit, right?  She’s not actually going to drop everything and move to Holland,  too? They said they had a surprise for  me… I wonder what…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe  they’ve come to tell me they’re getting married?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I laughed  to myself. I don’t know if that would  really surprise me at this point though… Anna-chan  certainly would have accepted if Izumi-san offered… and if Izumi-san was  willing to come along then surely their relationship didn’t implode…?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But if it’s not that…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  straightened out of my slight slouching as I felt my phone go off. They  must have landed. I looked around as I answered the call. “Anna-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“Kasumi-chan!</em><em> Hi!  Where are you? We’re just getting  off the plane.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I told her I was in the main  lobby. I heard a voice in the background  that I didn’t recognize, but I assumed it was just another passenger on the  plane walking past.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“Meet you at baggage claim?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I agreed and after she reminded  me which airplane she had taken, I set off to find the corresponding baggage  belt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“We have four bags. The large one I left with, a black suitcase,  a white suitcase, and a large brown bag.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I teased,  “Are you sure the white one isn’t large too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“No, she didn’t pack that much.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I frowned,  pausing for thought. Eventually shaking  my head, I stood and waited for the baggage.  I’d probably have to end the call so I could haul even one of those  supposedly ‘large’ suitcases… I hoped they wouldn’t take too many breaks before  getting here…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“We’re going to stop by the restroom for a  bit, you don’t mind, do you?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  sighed. “No, not at  all. Just don’t spend too long,  okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A few more  words and I was allowed to slip the phone back in my  pocket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usually,  the belt doesn’t start rolling for an awful long time, especially on long  overseas trips, but it seemed surprisingly quick this time. Or maybe it was because I had taken notice of  a girl in two ponytails, with long light-dirty-blond hair… humming softly to  herself as she waited for baggage. I  tried to ignore her, mind my own business, but I couldn’t help but glance over  at her every so often.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Once, she  turned towards me, and gave me a gentle closed eye smile. I shook my head, stepping forward as the  first bag appeared.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not mine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I kept  looking, and I found the black one. I  pulled at it and managed to get it to come loose. It felt heavy and yet light. As if the suitcase itself weighed a lot more  than the contents. Oh well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I set it  down beside me and started looking for the next bag. Oh! Brown! Alright…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I held the handle,  but it wouldn’t budge. I tugged harder,  and yelped as I was pulled along with the conveyer belt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then I  felt cool, gentle hands on mine, and a voice in my ear, “Pull together?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I could  only nod limply as we both tugged and got the bag onto the ground. I looked up, ready to thank the person…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was that  girl. She smiled at me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was  speechless, seeing her smile from such close range.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then Anna-chan and Izumi-san arrived.  I looked away from the girl to wave them over.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  last  two bags were picked up and I sighed, looking at the selection. Four  bags, two visitors? It didn’t seem to compute. Well it did but how did  Anna-chan leave with one and come back with two?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come on, Mitsuki-chan, let’s go!  You met Kasumi, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I blinked,  wondering who Anna-chan was referring to. I slowly followed her gaze and… found myself  looking at the blond girl again. She  smiled and then bowed a bit. “Nice to meet you. My  name is Sawatari Mitsuki.” Then she paused, as if remembering  something. Switching languages, she  repeated it in the local dialect, without the slightest sign of non-fluency. “I don’t know if you can speak Japanese well  enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I laughed,  speaking in Japanese, “I’m a born Japanese, so please  don’t feel you have to speak in an unnatural language, though you speak it  well, a lot better than Anna, surprisingly.  My name is Sawatari Kasumi. Pleased to meet you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Izumi piped  up, “Kasumi-san, Mitsuki-chan is my little sister by  a year. You don’t mind if she stays with  us, do you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stay…?” I looked at her again. Then I looked at the suitcases. Izumi and Anna had already claimed their bags  and were ready to go. That meant… “These  other two are yours?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smiled  apologetically, “Sorry to spring this on you… surprise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘Surprise…?  OH! </em>That’s<em> what they meant?’</em> I smiled back, reaching for one of her  bags. “It’s okay. It’s a pleasant surprise at least. Well, since you have two and I have none, I  suppose it’s only right that I take one… I’m glad I have a truck though… this  is a lot of luggage…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll take  the brown one, don’t worry.” She picked  the bag we had both lifted out of the belt as if it were nothing. Which was surprising  considering I didn’t know where she was hiding that muscle… “… Is there enough room for four?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I blinked  out of my daze as we started heading to the parking lot. “Yes.  It seats four anyway, sometimes five.  So did you have a good trip, Anna-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anna turned  halfway to look at me and smiled. “Yes,  I did actually. I’ll tell you all about  it once we’ve gotten home.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I nodded to  her and then asked Mitsuki-san, “Have you ever been  to Holland before?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She shook  her head. “Nope, I haven’t had the  chance. Thought I’d use my sister as an  excuse to tag along. You really don’t  mind?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The more  the merrier.” I looked down at the bag  she was carrying and teased, “It’s so bulky.  What do you have in there? An alligator?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her smile  dropped, just for a second. “If I did,  would that bother you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My  own  smile slipped, just a little, as I wondered if she was joking or not.  If I recall correctly, Anna-chan had spoken several times about a  certain alligator pet  that was always chasing Yoshitaka-kun… It couldn’t be… she didn’t…?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  sighed. “I don’t mind personally. As long as it doesn’t try  to kill me. And though our  apartment is fairly lenient on pets… I think an alligator on the loose might  scare a few too many neighbors…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She laughed  and nodded. “Reasonable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  ride  home was very pleasant. Mitsuki kept me company in the front while  Anna-chan and Izumi-san napped in the back. I asked if she wasn’t  tired, and she  responded that she had been smart and slept on the way over.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Our  conversation was light, and I pointed out a few of the local specials as we  drove along.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">By the time  we had arrived home, I dare say we had reached a very friendly, companionable  level. Or as another might say, “We just  clicked.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She took  the first shower, and her sister took the next.  Anna fell asleep again in the spare bedroom after dropping her  things. While I was preparing tea, Mitsuki-san came up to me and asked softly, “Will you play  a game with me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She told me  what had happened between Anna-chan and Izumi-san,  how Izumi-san had proposed just the other day.  It took a moment to digest, but I eventually nodded, accepting it. She then began to quickly whisper into my ear  the rules of the game.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I found  myself feeling more and more interested in her, and the way her mind worked,  the slight chill that it sent down my spine not quite unpleasant.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When she  finished, she smiled and winked at me.  “So will you be my partner in crime?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I slowly  walked over to her brown bag, wanting to satisfy my own curiosity first. “I don’t have anything better to do, and it  sounds interesting. So  sure. I just unclasp this,  right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She nodded,  watching me from the kitchen entrance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I wasn’t  quite sure what to think when I felt the top half of my body suddenly grow  clammy, darkness surrounding me. It  tickled a little too. And then I was  released, and there was an alligator sitting in front of me. I looked up at Mitsuki-san. “Did I pass?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Most would  be scared witless right about now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kasumi  looked at the alligator who was staring right back at her. “I guess I’m not most. I’ve always wanted a reptilian pet… though I  never expected I would be chomped by an alligator… You’re very gentle though,  aren’t you? Pochi, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  alligator grunted in a way that sounded remotely affirmative. I giggled, feeling something childishly  playful rear up inside me. I gave the  alligator a small peck on his snout and whispered, “I hope we can be good  friends, Pochi-chan.”  I looked up at Pochi’s owner. “All of us.”</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-Owari Epilogue-y.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A/N: Whee- a girl that likes Pochi almost as much as Mitsuki  does… You know, I always though Pochi could use a few  kisses. They have a very taming effect  if given by the right person. It also  occurred to me that Pochi must be extremely  self-controlled to chomp on someone without having his teeth hurt them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ah well. What game  has Mitsuki ensnared Kasumi into doing? I leave it up to your imagination. Something to do with Izumi and Anna not  knowing Kasumi has been told of the new engagement and Pochi  liking Kasumi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And you know, I actually think Mitsuki  has just the right amount of perfection in her to work for Kasumi. I mean, she can improv  lead in a rock band (cameo thing), has her own fan club, has excellent  management skills even in middle school… knows in general how to manipulate  things to her own liking… .n.n.  funness. She can probably teach Kasumi to cook even  better too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ah… speculation speculation…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Oh, but what happened to Yoshitaka? He wasn’t really in this story, was he? Oh wells.  Hmm… let’s see…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After Izumi finally let him go crazy…  Alicia and that second-rate (compared to Izumi) idol girl who rides a white  horse takes interest in Yoshitaka’s mansion and… by joint effort they turn it  into a hot springs so the girl can enjoy the profit and Yoshitaka can enjoy the  girls. Also, Yoshitaka’s cousin (also  rich) who owns the modeling publicist (I think) company can keep an eye on  Yoshitaka’s newest maids… and… general mayhem shall ensue in Japan.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Eventually, I suspect Anna-chan  shall move out and find a new place with Izumi-san, whether in Holland  or not, I’ll leave it to you. Perhaps Mitsuki shall eventually convince Kasumi to live with her  somewhere where Pochi can run free… while Mitsuki makes Kasumi her new ‘lingerie model client’…  Though I wonder how open Holland is  to that sort of thing, I have no idea.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Did I leave any other loose threads out? Hmm…Oh! June?  Hmm… well, I trust her to find a good girl to settle down with in Japan. She’s cool and levelheaded that way. Okay!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Again, thank you for all your reviews, and I hope you  enjoyed the show. I also hope you spread  the word of the shoujo-ai possibilities in HiMM, and read the manga  yourself, and maybe the anime. I  actually hope the US  /doesn’t/ do anything with it because if it were to be  dubbed… I don’t even want to think of it.  Somehow, I feel like the US  likes to kill shoujo-ai potential. You know, like how Haruka and Michiru are “cousins”?  Blegh.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In any case, has been a good month or so, and I hope you  don’t get eaten by any alligators. Ciao!</span></p>
