<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A week has  passed since I’ve come here, and honestly, I don’t think I could be  much happier to be exhausted to the bone. Izumi has been… has been…</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Well, let’s just say she’s been very good to me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I almost feel guilty for indulging.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Almost.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somewhere  in between playing Twister with her and the other girls, having  watermelon on the porch, going to a public beach only to protect each  other from the flocks of random single guys...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She'd stolen my heart again and again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It must be that smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anna-chan…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I fought back a giggle as she twirled a thin lock of my hair, tickling my cheek with it every so often. “Mm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  looked into her eyes, and lost myself in her soft expression, her eyes  telling she felt very relaxed… and had no real intention of getting up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s my turn… right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  nodded, though I neither remembered nor cared anymore. It was like I  told her that day… a day that seemed so recent, as if it were just  yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell me what you’re thinking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmhmm.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was just thinking of how cute you look when you’re starting to get sleepy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not my fault I stayed up so long…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It wasn’t mine either, at least not <em>tonight.</em>” I smiled as I leaned forward and kissed her cheek.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  wrinkled her nose a little and smiled, her eyes drifting closed. I  still reveled in how little she minded the things that I did now. But  then, denial only gets stronger with the strength of emotion that it  protects… so once one stops denying…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Izumi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I want to thank you again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For letting me stay here, with you, instead of at the mansion after Yoshitaka and them got back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They  weren’t that bad…” I bit my lip slightly as I smiled, lightly engaging  her idle hand into play mode. “I’m still surprised Mitsuki didn’t join  their drinking party.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m still appalled that they got those minors all drunk silly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t you glad your sister didn’t get drunk?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Izumi  smiled a little as she finally lashed out and grabbed my hand in hers,  constricting it before adjusting so she could rub her thumb over the  back of my hand. “Karen just had to come visiting then…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now  that I think on it…” I frowned, though I was too tired to object more  seriously. “Should we have left as early as we did? What if…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mitsuki likes her fun, but she and Pochi combined can keep a leash on Yoshitaka.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then why didn’t you join them sleeping there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wanted… to sleep without their loud drunken snores. Just with you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are  you going to tie me up again?” I couldn’t help but tease, even though  this wasn’t the first night we had slept in the same bed. Without fear  of what the other would do in our sleep.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only if you want me to…  but…” She scooted closer, letting go of my hand to draw my body closer  to hers in a loose embrace. “You make a good… pillow this way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Giggling softly, I snuggled closer to her on my own account. “So do you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We let the silence blanket us for several minutes. Not out of awkwardness, but of comfortable companionship.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I had closed my eyes, expecting that she just wanted to sleep now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then I felt her lips on mine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Soft,  just a brush, as if she had lunged but hadn’t quite made it to the  other side. My lips felt lonely without hers. So I chased them before  they could retreat completely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She whined softly, not in an unhappy way, but a it-didn’t-work-out-the-way-I-wanted way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I opened my eyes and in the dim light of the closed-blind window, I saw her pout.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ten years can change a person so much.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or maybe it was just the situation at hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I leaned a little closer, and then closed my eyes again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My guard was almost completely down again when her lips made full contact with mine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She even wiggled her tongue a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She’s so cute.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Obliging her, I opened my mouth a little, accepting her and giving a little back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She started that soft little whimper again. What now? I stopped trying to give back, and she was happy again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She’s so strange.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But still so cute.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  she stopped, she merely bent her head down so she could nuzzle my neck.  Which did feel good. Even though it tickled horribly. It stopped when  she had settled down to sleep again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Silence reigned once more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good night.” She whispered in a soft, all too sleepy voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I kiss the top of her head, which was closest. “Sweet dreams.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She yawned one of those puppy yawns… mouth opens wide… but only a small yip comes out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Can I take her home with me?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Oh wait, I already did.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even though this hotel isn’t <em>really</em> my home…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I glanced at the clock.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">1:30.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I should have let her go to sleep sooner.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Oh well. She didn’t seem to mind <em>too</em> much.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I smiled, closing my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘Pleasant dreams… really.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-------Dream: A variation on sheep jumping over fences-----</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  meadow was pure white, the trees decorated with a sheen of snow. I was  in a large bed, an impossibly large bed, like the Seven Dwarves' beds  put end to end for Snow white large.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was very warm in that bed. The pillows were soft too. But where was Izumi?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">On  the other side of the icy creek, the chibified Izumi crouched there,  looking absolutely miserable despite her perfectly cute white bunny  pajamas.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I called to her gently, telling her to jump over. She  seemed nervous, as if she had had bad memories of the water, but she  backed away and bounded on over, right into my arms. She was shivering  in her cold, so I pressed her little body to my chest and pulled the  blanket up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ahnna!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ahnah!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked up, and on the  other side of the creek, many many more Izumi-usa-chans stared  appearing, wanting to share my warmth. They kept coming and coming,  like 101 Dalmations.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I opened my arms wide and beckoned them over. I decided to count them as they passed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was already one…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Two…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Three...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Four…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The fifth one slipped off into the creek, but number three, four, and six helped five up safely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Six…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Seven…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Two hundred eighty six…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Two hundred eighty seven…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There were still more… it was never ending… and that was when I knew that this was as it should be.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I would never tire of snuggling up with my Izumi-bunny.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-End Dream-</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Three hundred forty-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  felt those lips on mine again. She was getting good at this surprise  attack thing. Did she want me to scream? She would have to do much more  than just kiss me to hear me scream…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But that was surely for another day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning.” I smiled at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s afternoon.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As I sat up, looking around, I sighed. So it was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She squeezed me tight, as if she never wanted to let go.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then she let go.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But I still loved her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anna-chan…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you want for lunch? Your turn, remember?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Was it?” I had such a nice dream, I feel like I already had a turn… “Room service?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She pouted cutely again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was too early in the morning to refuse it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But I didn’t know what I was refusing, so I had to ask first. “What did you have in mind?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wanted to cook you breakfast… I’ve gotten better you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lunch, Izumi, lunch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right, that’s what I meant.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  this is a hotel; not an apartment. We’d have to go all the way to the  mansion to have a kitchen to use, and by the time we get there…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She pouted cutely at me. <em>Again.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She really was getting to develop an evil side.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And I don’t mean the ‘Call me Queen’ syndrome.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, I suppose we could work up an appetite walking and maybe get there in time to make dinner. Together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Together?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I nodded. “I’ve gotten better too. A little.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She perked up happily. I could almost see a tail wagging behind her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I wondered if bunnies could wag their tails. Their ears maybe.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I imagined my little Izumi-bunny wiggling her ears at me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I almost had a heart attack from cuteness overload. I climbed out of bed. “You want to take a shower first?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She clamped onto my arm. “Together!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Now this was getting to be a little much, even from my little bunny.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I pulled her cheeks, wondering if she had somehow gotten drunk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Owwie, owwie, thah huhhhtsss!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or gotten hit by a thick branch when I wasn’t watching.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Izumi? Are you feeling okay?” I let go of her cheeks so she could answer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Annah meanie… I’m just fine!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I didn’t feel ready to believe it. She sounded like she had gotten an intake of helium.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Gimmie water first.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I walked over to the mini-refrigerator and brought her a bottle of water from it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She drank half of it in one go.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But when she spoke, her voice was back. Especially after a bit of coughing and throat clearing. “Happy now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Were you serious about showering together?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well after the creek incident…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I smiled upon remembering ‘the creek incident’. A very good day that was…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She slapped my arm, and I realized she still blushed over that day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Which made me wonder about the showering…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m just used to it, okay? After all those years of using Yoshitaka’s bathhouse…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I smiled. <em>This</em> I might believe, especially with her blushingly guilty look. “Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can  I um, get a change of clothes too?” I watched in amusement as she  wriggled around with her hands behind her back. “I… kind of left  without thinking…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pick whatever you like. Though I’m here on vacation, so I don’t have that much either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minutes  later, when we stepped into the freakishly small shower together, I  felt like we had gone one step into the past and three steps into the  future.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It had to be the future, because God knows we didn’t spend our baths like <em>this</em> when we were in middle school.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Cue image of Pochi’s Godfather and Hamster mistress watching television.</span></p>
