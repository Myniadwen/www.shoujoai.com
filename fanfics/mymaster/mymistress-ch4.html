<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you  sure you’re all right?” I looked both  ways before beginning to lead us across the street, concentrating on Anna.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smiled  up at me, assured me that she was fine, but something told me she still wanted  to cry a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I quickly  tried to think of something that would cheer her up, and it seemed the answer  was right in front of my eyes. “You  know, I get discounts on all the pieces I’ve personally modeled in. Do you want one? To bring home with you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As I  watched her descend into a heavy blush, I bit my lip. All right. So maybe that wasn’t the smartest move to  offer my engaged ex-fellow-maid and ex-stalker.  I considered retracting the offer, but she spoke up with a bit of a  spark in her eyes. “Could I? Kasumi is actually a bit of a… lingerie  fanatic. I swear she’s obsessed with  dressing me up in the latest thing she buys.  It’d be nice to choose something myself for a change. Have you been doing this long?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I smiled as  I opened the door for her, giving her a quick once-over. <em>The  last few years have been good to her… she’s definitely finished filling out… I  wonder if we’re the same size? </em>“I wouldn’t have  offered if you couldn’t. I’ve been with  them for about three years now, I guess, so they don’t mind. I actually have more of a discount now than  when I first started. I’m not quite sure  what to do with all of it, so I let friends in on my discount.” I paused, and  then laughed. “Lingerie  fanatic? You mean you’ve found a  female version of Yoshitaka?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!” Anna frowned, flustered but indignant as  well. Oops, I guess I hit a sore  spot. “I didn’t mean it like that! Kasumi is… Kasumi is… she’s a lot gentler  about it… and since I do own things other than lingerie, she always leaves open  the option of not wearing it to bed…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I nodded  understandingly as I watched Anna’s eyes wander around the shop. I then stopped and went over her words again,  realizing that she could have also implied that there were nights when she  didn’t wear <em>anything</em> to bed…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Izumi-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Startled, I  looked at her, albeit a little nervously. “W-what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  blushing… was it something I said? Or  because of where we are?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked  around, and I realized we’d wandered to the BDSM section, the place I tried  hard to avoid unless for a very good reason.  The memories of everyone rushing away when I had last cracked a whip  were still fresh wounds on my pride.  “I-it’s nothing. I was just  thinking…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Of you poking your head out from underneath  the blanket… knowing you were wearing nothing  underneath…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“B-boss! You here?” Stop it, Izumi… just stop… don’t go there… “I  have a friend with me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Moments  later, I heard my boss call from the back room, “Izumi-chan? Oh, good timing, dear, your guest only just  arrived.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  noticed  that Anna’s eyes had widened just slightly, giving way as she frowned.  I took hold of her hand. Out of instinct if nothing else. “What’s  wrong? Nervous?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She shook  her head, walking alongside me with a tense expression. She wasn’t a very good liar…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We stepped  into the small parlor, a comfortable setting of two sofas facing each other  with a coffee table in between and lounge chairs on either end. A lean older woman was seated in one of the  chairs… the lingerie shop’s owner. That  leaves the girl on the sofa to be…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“June-chan?!” In disbelief, I distantly felt myself let go  of Anna and walked towards her as she stood up.  We hugged, exchanging greetings.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It wasn’t  until Anna spoke up that I remembered where we were. “Um… so you know each other then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Separating  from June, albeit neither reluctantly nor in surprise, I said, “Sorry, let me introduce you.  Anna, this is June Kobayashi, my first roommate in college. June, this is Anna Kurauchi,  an old friend I lived and worked with in middle school. Ah… this is nostalgic… What are the chances  of meeting two old friends after losing contact for a couple of years in the  same day?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And it had to be these two, of all people…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anna and  June bowed to each other before we all sat down. I hope Anna wasn’t troubled by the fact that  I was sitting next to June instead of her… she seemed a little lonely on the  other couch all by herself but… I glanced at June, and received a grin. I had to make sure she kept her mouth shut  about our few months we had together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Alicia,  though I preferred to call her Boss, clapped her hands with a smile. “Such beautiful friends too… I wasn’t sure if  I should believe June-san’s story about knowing you  personally, but if she wasn’t a random stalker, I was going to ask her to join  our list of models. How  about it, June-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">June  laughed, leaning back in a way that her meaningful glance in my direction would  go undetected. “Sorry, but I’m afraid  I’m exclusive. I only model for my one  and only.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Accepting  tea as Boss dished it out, I remarked, “That reminds me! Anna-chan just told  me that she was getting married so- Hm.” I paused, and then laughed at myself, turning  to look at Anna. “I forgot to ask when  the big day was.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She mumbled  a quick answer before dousing her tongue with the tea.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">June  smiled. “Sorry? Didn’t  catch that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anna  swallowed and answered again. “Two  weeks. On the 20th.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I knew my  eyes widened in surprise. “That soon?!” I sighed, leaning back. I was looking forward to seeing what I could  do to help too… “Then most of the preparations are already done, aren’t they?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She gave me  a quizzical look, slowly nodding. At  least she didn’t seem tense anymore.  “These next two weeks of vacation in Japan  on my own is supposed to be a sort of… prolonged bachelorette  party. Or, as someone  else put it, my last chance at freedom before tying the knot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">June and  Boss laughed, but that was because they didn’t know.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anna was  looking only at me, though it was a little different than when we were both  maids.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Could it be  that…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The reason  she was so nervous that she kept hanging up without saying anything…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The reason  she had enlisted Mitsuki’s help in meeting up with  me…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The reason  she came back to Japan  so suddenly…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Was to  resolve her old feelings for me?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I shook my  head, breaking eye contact. It couldn’t  be that. That was a long, long time  ago. She met and fell in love with  another girl, someone who she makes happy.  There’s no reason why she would still…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But she’s  here now… that much was undeniable.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I tried to  laugh it off. “If you haven’t already  picked one out, Yoshitaka could probably make a wedding dress for you… he can  be decent when he tries.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smiled,  remembering what I was remembering, way back when.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yoshitaka’s  so-called greatest treasure had been a wedding dress he’d made for me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A flashback  image of Anna in a wedding dress, prepared to run off to Holland  with me, entered my mind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not just  any memory either.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It had been  right after I’d ‘shown Yoshitaka how it was done’… with Anna…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“No matter what anyone else says… I never  want to leave your side.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Blushing, I stood up. Mumbling that I had to use the restroom, I left  abruptly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I closed my  eyes as I shut the one-stall bathroom door behind me. “You idiot… That’s in the past… it’s all in  the past… And she knows I didn’t mean it… I have never… I don’t… I won’t think  of her that way. Anna-chan has finally found someone worthy of her… I can’t… augh!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I jumped as  I heard a knock from the other side of the door. I hadn’t realized I was talking aloud to  myself until the muffled voice said, “I-zu-mi-chan…  This door isn’t actually that thick you know… let me in?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">June-chan…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reluctantly,  I unlocked the door and stepped off to the side. Moments later, the door opened, and she  locked the door behind her. As I looked  down at the tile floor, her arms slithered up my shoulders and past… pulling me  closer. She purred my name again, softer  but clearer than before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I didn’t  respond.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That girl…  Anna-chan, was it?  What was your <em>real</em> relationship with her? I don’t mean your  living situation either. There aren’t  many things in this world that can make <em>you</em> flee.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She already  knew. Not ten minutes observing and she  could already figure it out. June was a  sharp one, after all. And  always straight to the point. “Nothing  happened…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She kissed  my cheek, and I didn’t shirk it. “Nothing? You said  that to your friends in college, too, didn’t you? That day, after hours, when we were almost  caught in the-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I pointedly  looked down. “Don’t say it. Please… don’t say it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She tilted  my chin up, whispering, “Then tell me, from your own  lips.” I closed my eyes as she kissed  me. “How far did you go together?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Thinking  about how much I had led her on made my stomach churn…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’d  protected her from Yoshitaka… enough to get her to become interested in me  instead.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She’d  kissed me… but I was mostly asleep then.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’d given  her one of my bras… but it was just a bribe.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We’d slept  together… but I had bound and gagged her first.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’d courted her in public… but  played it off as insincere.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She’d run  away to find me… and the first thing I did was hit her and push her away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The only  thing we hadn’t done… no, the only thing <em>I</em> hadn’t done… was be sincere about the things that I  did with her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I felt a  tear on my cheek, and I pressed my face against June’s collarbone, wishing time  could be rewound. “June… I’m a horrible  person… aren’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She wiped  away my tears and kissed my head.  “Everybody wouldn’t have fallen in love with you if you were such a  horrible person, Izumi. They- no, I, for  one, love you because you try so hard to stay honest… unlike other people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That only made me cry harder. “That’s why.  I’m not that honest at all… no matter how hard I may have ‘tried’.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was  quiet for a long time, simply stroking my hair.  Then she whispered, “Izumi… forget about the past. Right now, how do you really feel? Who do you love?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I thought  about all of the people who had liked me and chased after me throughout the  years. I searched in my heart for the  one that resonated best with my own feelings.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The answer  I found left me weak in the knees.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But she  held me steady.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What I  eventually told her was:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I don’t  know. I don’t think I ever knew.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What she  asked in response was:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Do you feel  up to finding out?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A/N: I wonder if that  was a bit too soon for a breakdown? Hmm… Oh well, so  what if it’s a little unrealistic. He is  My Master is, by nature, rather unrealistic.  Doesn’t make it any less amusing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And sorry if my throwing in more obstacles such as June  represents… it’s just more fun I think. .n.n.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  I was going to list what BDSM meant here, but even  though I understand the concept, I’m not one-hundred percent certain  what is stands for. I  mean, it could be Bondage-Domination-Slave-Master… Or it could be  Bondage-Dominatrix-Sadist-Masochist… or it could be a weird acronym (?)  for BonDage SiMulation… cuz it’s not “real” serious bondage… Or it  could be that  I’m overthinking this whole thing entirely and should  just shut up about it…</span></p>
