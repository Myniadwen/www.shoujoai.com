&#39;The Land Wind Promised&#39; (Evil Zone)
 
Evil Zone

The Summons Plan of the Four Nations of I-Praseru had been successful to 
a certain degree. All those who had been summon from far and wide, from 
Earth, Planet Idanza, Planet Aradia and even further beyond had been the 
cream of the crop. The some of strongest warriors of their respective 
tribes and home-worlds. But in the end... all their individual paths led 
to this one place in point and time. Evil Zone. And the one who dwelled 
within it, sealed... but not trapped. Waiting simply to absorb the 
&#39;fragment&#39; of her power to where it truly belonged 

The enemy of I-Praseru, Ihadurca. 

She was the one true nexus, the one true fulcrum upon which, the humble 
fates of so many lives wavered on. And it was her total destruction that 
was the truest purpose of the Summons Plan. All those who were assembled 
to I-Praseru were slowly whittled away for the one person who could 
accurately carry out the true will of the Summons Plan (for her own 
purposes or not). And ironically she was the only one in this theatrical 
production who had not been summoned. No... she came of her own accord 
to this morbid place. A supernatural prison, surrounded by thick winds 
and crumbling pillars. 

And her name was Kakurine. A being of veritable, remorseless purity.  

As the howling of the infernal winds grew stronger and louder whilst 
circling the Land Wind Promised, the two &#39;wild cards&#39; of this game stood 
before each other. The thick tone of silence and the mesh of amusement 
and resentment in their respective faces showed the weight of their 
impending, inevitable conflict The innocently poised Kakurine stood away 
from the characteristically relaxed Ihadurca, separated by a thin layer 
of air and space. Ten metres. Enough for deep emotions to see and be 
seen. Facial, of course. There was no brilliant form of magic or 
spiritual power that could see beyond these expressions and touch upon 
what existed in their hearts. But then... why would they need it? These 
two understood each other better than anyone else probably ever could. 
In more ways than one. 

Whilst her small feet dangling in the air, her body suspended aerially 
via her supernatural powers, Kakurine gave a warm, misleading smile to 
the other woman, her arms crossed behind her back. &quot;It&#39;s been such a 
long time, hasn&#39;t it, Lea? Or should I say, Ihadurca?&quot;

Ihadurca, with her mighty staff Vanalgando in hand, snorted. &quot;Hmph. 
Kakurine. So it was you I sensed. I should have guessed it all along. 
After all... who else but you would have had the power to subvert all 
those who have been called to this land...&quot;

&quot;Perhaps the &#39;Fragment&#39; and its human vessel?&quot;

Such a comment drew a smile from Ihadurca. &quot;...Maybe. But of course... 
you took care of that little issue as well, didn&#39;t you? Yes... she may 
have heeded my call, but... you were successful in obstructing her 
approach.&quot;

Kakurine simply nodded, the invisible bell upon the Void jingling with 
the action. &quot;It was a necessary action. Regardless of her true 
intentions, I could see that the Earth girl would not be much help. At 
least not to my benefit, anyway.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Ihadurca put forth, &quot;does meeting with the fragment bring back 
too many memories for you? Of the past? Is that why you eliminated it?&quot;

A smirk came from the shorter woman. &quot;No. I simply wished to prevent it 
from fulfilling the duties that are mine to accomplish.&quot; 

&quot;My execution, I presume?&quot;

&quot;Correct,&quot; Again, Kakurine bobbed her head, &quot;...Selfish as it may sound, 
I have to be the sole one to kill you. The sole one that keeps killing 
you. That is my task. And its results are something I cannot afford to 
lose&quot;

Ihadurca placed her free hand at her hip, still smiling. &quot;...Still 
fixated with the phantoms of the past, are you? Hmph. I can&#39;t much blame 
you. No matter how hopeless your inane quest is. Do you remember? Do you 
still cherish the memory of that day in your heart?&quot;

&quot;Yes...&quot; Kakurine offered, &quot;...But unlike you... I have no intention of 
letting it fade into merely that. A memory. Nor do I wish the same for 
the times before it. The times that keep me alive. The times that 
brought me here.&quot;

It was then that Ihadurca&#39;s smile fell. What could she say she felt 
about that? Was it jealousy? In what sense was she the one to be there? 
Though Lea&#39;s ego and Lea&#39;s emotions had been poured into her numerous 
incarnations... she was essentially an individual at that time. And 
although Ihadurca could accurately recall all those moments before the 
fateful shattering of the support system... those were not her memories. 
Those belonged to the one that Kakurine truly loved... and the source of 
Ihadurca&#39;s love for her killer. Was all of this bound to Lea? It would 
it be so... forever?

So many fates had been re-written by Ihadurca&#39;s rampage. But so much of 
those needs were governed by the will of three independent individuals 
cast into a sole form. The Id of Lea, the Superego of Ihadurca Il Imella 
and the production of the conflict between both, the Ego of Ihadurca. 
This body of destruction was possessed by conflict all of which stemmed 
from Lea&#39;s will. Was this what she had wanted all along? Ihadurca had 
long since come to define herself as an individual but was it this any 
example of it?

Ultimately... did Lea&#39;s resolve account for so much? 

In her thoughts of this, Ihadurca addressed a different issue. &quot;...Why 
do you hide yourself?&quot;

Kakurine knew forthrightly what that comment meant. &quot;Does it bother you? 
To speak normally might draw more attention to myself than necessary. 
But since this is considered the most secure place in I-Praseru... I may 
as well shed the mask&quot;

Just like that, the childish, innocent tone of voice that Kakurine had 
used in this world melted away as though it had never been there. And it 
was replaced by the lower, deeper tone of a fully grown adult female. A 
voice that reflected the knowledge and power that existed deep within 
the pure existence of Kakurine. 

&quot;Is this better?&quot; She questioned.

To hear Kakurine speak with the adult tone she had fallen in love with 
so many years ago brought a little twinge to Ihadurca&#39;s heart. Small, 
but palpable. And very impossible to ignore. &quot;...Much.&quot;

&quot;I see that you remember,&quot; Kakurine spoke in her adult voice, &quot;That is 
regrettable. I would have hoped to kill you before those memories 
returned It would have been better that way.&quot;

The wings of the Absolute Existence chimed behind her. &quot;So. You intend 
to kill me, is that it? Just as you did on Earth those ... years ago? 
Silly girl. You&#39;re just as na&#139;ve as you ever were.&quot;

&quot;I must keep killing you. Until you are the very last one remaining. I 
will collapse all of your Incarnations into one form... then you can 
love me again.&quot;

It was then that Ihadurca&#39;s voice began to rise. &quot;At the cost of my own 
individuality? What of Gillaclva and the true wielder of Shahal who 
dwells within the Cocutos? Do you so expect them to relinquish their 
lives for the sake of you and your petty endeavours?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t expect them to lay down their lives,&quot; Kakurine retorted, &quot;It&#39;s 
why I forced myself to corrupt the beauty of the Void with the creation 
of the Armour Void. It was why I sent wave after wave of Spiritual 
Combatants to crush your other forms. Though this action was hardly 
successful... it served one true purpose...&quot;

&quot;And what might that be?&quot;

The floating, child-like form of Kakurine faded backwards in a small 
burst of teleportation, setting her back into a position from which she 
could do battle. &quot;The failures of Armour Void and the Spiritual 
Combatants showed me that I must attend to the issues that concern me. I 
have to be the one to kill you. Only I have that power And I want you to 
like me again... that&#39;s why you have to die...&quot;

Ihadurca closed her powerful, knowledgeable eyes, smiling all the while, 
&quot;...You hated me and killed me for it on that day... a selfish will to 
your own personal happiness... but what is it about you... that prevents 
me from carrying a distaste for you? Why do I feel the way that I do... 
about you...? Why I wonder?&quot;

Kaiser&#39;s Afterthoughts

* This fic was written about seven months ago; so it may seem a little 
outdated in comparison to my current writing style. But I wanted to get 
this chapter out because I&#39;m a little tired of seeing it lingering out 
my EZ folder aimlessly. 

* I&#39;m aware that this chapter is short, and I&#39;m sorry about that, but I 
will write more. I plan to have Kakurine and Ihadurca review their 
feelings by memories -- but because I have no idea what Lea looks like 
or where they lived before Lea broke the system between herself and 
Kakurine, I&#39;ll need to think about it for a little while. If anyone has 
any ideas, I&#39;d be glad to hear them!
