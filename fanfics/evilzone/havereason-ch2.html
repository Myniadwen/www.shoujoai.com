~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Setsuna&#39;s Room, Mikamuro College Dorms, Tokyo, Japan

{We can&#39;t just ignore it, Setsuna...}

As the transparent, spectral apparition of Karin floated slowly in the 
air around her, Setsuna quickly set about fixing her room around for 
Midori&#39;s arrival. She had none of her friend&#39;s sloppiness when it came 
to personal living; but her dorm room spoke differently today. The  
Guardian Angel whizzed around the room with great speed, picking up any 
items of hers that were simply not necessary to have hanging around. 
These included the usual stuff. Unwashed underwear, unfolded clothes, 
random CD cases, old fast food wrappers, etc. It was about time that she 
cleared all this stuff up anyway. Of course, Karin&#39;s focus was not on 
the state of Setsuna&#39;s dorm room. Far from it.

By now, Setsuna was riffling through a collection of thick books that 
had been stacked up in the corner of her dorm. Taking great note of what 
she was withdrawing from it. &quot;...I&#39;m not ignoring it. But you said it 
yourself. It was a brief flicker, probably nothing more than that.&quot;

Karin clutched her hands together. {I know that that happens sometimes, 
but... that feeling was... different somehow. It may have been a 
sporadic burst, but... I&#39;ve never felt miasma that strong. Not since... 
Vice...}

&quot;...&quot; 

Not that Setsuna wanted to think about him. Something Karin could both 
see in the Japanese girl&#39;s face, as well as feel in her heart. A vivid 
look of sadness passed over Karin&#39;s face. She had forgotten how much 
resentment Setsuna felt for her nemesis. {I... I&#39;m sorry, Setsuna. I 
really didn&#39;t mean to bring him into this...}

The young woman shook her head. &quot;No. It&#39;s okay. Vice will have to be 
contended with again at some point. We can&#39;t avoid that. But if it is 
him... we&#39;ll be ready. After all... you were the one who told me not to 
hide my weaknesses from you, right?&quot;

Karin nodded with a renewed smile. {Yes.}

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t worry so much, Karin,&quot; Three history books were taken by 
Setsuna from that pile of schoolbooks, &quot;if it means something more then 
we will investigate. But for now I just want to help Midori with her 
History Report. She can be such a slacker when it comes to her student 
life. But she&#39;s come a long way so far. I can&#39;t let her screw up now.&quot;

After taken the books she assumed that she&#39;d need, everything was pretty 
much set. All they needed now was some takeout. But Midori was the one 
bringing that today. There was just one last thing that needed to be 
taken care of. 

Klau Solas. 

Setsuna&#39;s  smooth eyes rolled to her bed on the other side of her 
moderately large dorm room. The polished and powerful sword of Justice 
had been placed there this morning. She couldn&#39;t leave that hanging 
around while Midori came here. The Japanese woman quickly strode over to 
her weapon and clutched the hilt in a firm grip. Then kneeled down and 
slipped the blade under her bed, hiding it from view. With that one last 
action, the room looked just right for Midori. 

Setsuna beamed and rested both hands upon her delicate hips. &quot;Well. I 
think that looks about right, don&#39;t you, Karin?&quot;

{Yes.} She replied. 

Of course, anything more Karin wanted to say would have to wait. Both 
women cast their eyes to the right as they heard an impatient knock on 
the door to their dorm. It had to be Midori. Karin sighed with 
resignation. Although she liked Midori, just as much as Setsuna did, she 
hated having to hide herself within her host&#39;s body. Especially in 
private. These times alone weren&#39;t rare... but keeping her friendship 
with Setsuna and her own existence private was a hard choice. But also 
an unavoidable one. When a second knock came, a little louder than the 
first, Karin shifted herself over to her host and entered her body. 
Setsuna slipped her eyes shut with the sudden addition of Karin&#39;s 
warmth, then strode over to the door. 

Her hand gripped the doorknob and she opened, revealing none other than 
the Fuin Martial Artist herself, Himeno Midori. In one hand was a pizza 
box, and in the other was backpack. At least she came prepared. &quot;Hey, 
Yuki. Hope you don&#39;t mind a slice of western life today. I don&#39;t usually 
trek all the way to Roppongi for a pizza; but you can&#39;t really get one 
this good anywhere else. It&#39;s like Gaijin heaven.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not a problem,&quot; Setsuna said, turning and walking back into her 
dorm, &quot;it&#39;s better than your staple bowl of rice every now and again. 
Besides... we&#39;ve got work to do.&quot;

Midori heaved a sigh, walking into her friend&#39;s dorm and placing the 
pizza box down on the bedside table. As much as she enjoyed spending 
time with Setsuna, she couldn&#39;t stand having to do this History work. 
Maybe that was the real reason she put it off for so long. All due to a 
blunt distaste. Who knew? 

Then Setsuna looked over at the taller girl. &quot;First things first. What 
exactly do you have to do? If we haven&#39;t got the right books then we may 
have to go to the library to pick them up. It doesn&#39;t close until 10.00 
tonight, so we&#39;ve got a couple hours.&quot;

Midori dropped her backpack to the ground and sat down with it, in a 
cross-legged position. &quot;Well... we were asked to choose a character from 
a certain historical age and then write up a &#39;detailed&#39; account of their 
lives in regards to their political achievements and legacy.&quot;

Setsuna sat down with her friend. &quot;Well then, who did you pick?&quot;

&quot;We were given a choice in class,&quot; Midori responded, &quot;out of Frederick 
the Great, Stalin, Oda Nobunaga, Kublai Khan, George Washington, 
Charlemagne and Winston Churchill.&quot;

Not a fair choice of game. &quot;Who did you pick?&quot;

&quot;Charlemagne.&quot;

&quot;And...&quot; Setsuna couldn&#39;t help but let her shoulders sag, &quot;...do you 
even know who he is?&quot;

&quot;Nope.&quot;

&quot;So then why did you choose him?&quot; 

The red-headed tomboy shrugged. &quot;His name just sounded cool, I guess.&quot;

Eh. Again, typical Midori. Setsuna fixed her forehead into her palm with 
irritation. This might take a bit longer than she thought it would. 
&quot;...We better get to work from now then. I should have a book about the 
Holy Roman Empire somewhere around here. If I can&#39;t find it then I&#39;ll 
just run down to the library to pick one up.&quot;

And so they worked. 

The first thing they did was find that book. Like she believed, Setsuna 
had it around. She recalled that a year ago she was asked to write a 
report on the Holy Roman Empire herself. And she liked what she read. So 
rather than taking out a book from the library, she bought one about it 
herself. She would have had no idea that she would be using it to bail 
out Midori a year later. Secondly they laid out a plan. Rather than 
Setsuna simply doing this for her friend; she motivated Midori into 
doing this for herself (hard as it was). Eventually they managed to 
carve a plan of action for the essay. Starting in key points from 
Charlemagne&#39;s first taste of power to his eventual death. That in itself 
took at least an hour. But in theory, the hardest part of the work was 
done. Now that they knew where they were, all they had to do was fill in 
the bulk of the blanks. Both girls were assigned a chapter to read over. 
They&#39;d make notes throughout the read and then gather together the 
information later. The book itself wasn&#39;t very thick, it was more about 
the bare facts rather than the overwhelming details, which made this 
action far easier. An hour and a half later, the two students had 
amassed enough information about the key points they had laid out to 
finally start writing the essay. Another three hours and an empty pizza 
box later, Midori was tiredly scribbling the final details of the 
conclusion. Her pencil (which had to be re-sharpened eight times from 
all the writing) came to a rest just a short few seconds later. The last 
paragraph: finished off. 

&quot;Oh man...&quot; Midori instantly chucked the pencil away, clutching her sore 
hand, &quot;I have never written so much in my life! I&#39;ll never be able to 
punch as hard again! Hey Yuki, I&#39;m...&quot;

The tomboy trailed off when she saw her raven-haired friend. Fast 
asleep. They had been working for hours, and Setsuna had been working 
her butt off, all to keep Midori on track. The Fuin Martial Artist 
smiled tiredly. As much as she hated doing all of this for a report that 
she really didn&#39;t much care about, she couldn&#39;t have felt more grateful 
to the Saizuki girl. After all, she didn&#39;t have to do this. Nobody was 
forcing Setsuna to make such an effort. That was a choice all of her 
own. It was simply an extension of her kindness. 

&quot;She&#39;s so unselfish,&quot; Midori told herself, &quot;...is that what I like most 
about her?&quot;

But there were so many aspects of the shorter girl that made her so 
appealing. To Midori and to others. Her polite mannerisms, her sweet 
nature, her unrelenting kindness... 

...Her inescapable beauty.

And that was something that Midori had dwelled on more than once. But 
simply to see Saizuki Setsuna would allow anyone to understand why 
Midori would feel this way. The tranquil Guardian Angel was utter 
beautiful. In every possible sense of the term. From her silky raven 
black hair to her delicate milky toned skin. Those dark, soulful eyes 
and her unbelievable personality... all such details equalled something 
close to the perfect woman; at least in Midori&#39;s mindset. Though Setsuna 
had a tendency to innocently nag at Midori over (in the Fuin Fighter&#39;s 
opinion) trivial things, there was very little in the world that could 
outweigh the caring and attachment she felt for this girl. And it was 
times like this that reminded Midori of the severity of those emotions. 

Even now, as Midori silently stared upon the sleeping form of her 
friend, she could feel the clouds of emotion impinging on her. But this 
time the attraction she felt had a stronger angle to work with. The 
taller girl ignored the stirring of butterflies in her stomach. But not 
Setsuna. And it was at this time that Midori realized she was shaking. 
But that didn&#39;t stop her from pulling up her free arm at her side. Her 
trembling, gloved hand slowly inched towards Setsuna&#39;s sleeping visage; 
maybe before she even knew what she was doing. Midori laid an unusually 
gentle (and frightened) touch upon Setsuna&#39;s pale cheek, absorbing the 
quaint softness of her facial flesh. Soon Midori grew brave enough to 
give that cheek a slow stroke, moving in time with Setsuna&#39;s own slow, 
sleeping breaths. 

Times like this allowed Midori to be more honest with herself. Just not 
enough to express those truths to Setsuna in the full. &quot;...I wish... I 
could tell you... Setsuna...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Mr. Kakemono&#39;s Room, Mikamuro College, Tokyo, Japan

&quot;Well class, I must say that I&#39;m very pleased with your reports. Maybe 
more so than usual, in fact.&quot;

One week had passed since Midori and Setsuna had stayed up all night to 
complete the put-off History Essay. Things had gone by swimmingly that 
night. Despite all the work and despite that fact that Midori hated such 
work, they had managed to get the report ready for the following Monday. 
Now it was time to see what the results were. The essay counted for over 
a third of Midori&#39;s grade. If she screwed up the essay, then the rest of 
this lesson was practically a complete write-off. The Fuin School 
student nervously ran a hand through her spiky red hair as her History 
teacher, Kakemono Gendo, strode up aside the aisle of desks in the 
middle of the room. The same aisle that Midori sat it. As he passed by 
each of the firm wooden desks he handed the students their respective 
reports. Most gave expressions of joy, others weren&#39;t as pleased. But 
that was to be expected. Midori just hoped that she didn&#39;t fall into the 
latter category. Slowly but surely, Mr. Kakemono made his way up to 
Midori, with her History Report in hand. He stopped before her desk and 
gave her a surprised smile.

&quot;Ah, Miss Himeno...&quot; He began ominously, &quot;I&#39;m actually quite surprised 
by your work on this account. Some of your other teachers expressed the 
same sentiment when I spoke to them of it.&quot;

Midori blinked, squirming internally. &quot;...So then... what&#39;s the verdict, 
teach...?&quot;

&quot;...B+.&quot; The teacher said, &quot;I was quite surprised at the amount of 
detail you put into this report, Miss Himeno. Especially considering 
some of your previous efforts. If only your handwriting were more 
legible, I could have offered an even higher grade.&quot;

With a surprised, cheerful expression on her face, Midori socked her 
fist into her palm. She did. She actually did it. &quot;I can&#39;t believe it... 
I passed!&quot;

&quot;Just keep up the good work. My misgivings of your ability are beginning 
to fade, but you have to maintain the effort. Understand?&quot; 

Midori nodded to her teacher, as he soon moved on to other desks to hand 
each student their essays. Then as she settled down again, the school 
bell went in that drab, monotone way it always did. But most of the 
students were more than happy to hear it. Including Midori. With this 
essay out of the way, she could finally get back to preparing for the 
Keisho Ritual. The fiery teen leapt from her desk with her essay, 
slotted it into her backpack and slung that over her shoulder. Midori 
then made a b-line straight for the door and paced quickly down the 
following hallway, zooming past all those students who happened to be 
pouring out of their own classrooms. Unlike most of these guys, Midori 
was heading home. She was one of the few people who didn&#39;t live on 
campus. She lived at the Himeno Training Grounds with her Father, unlike 
Setsuna, whom had chosen to live in the dorms. After worming her agile 
way through the many halls and staircases of Mikamuro College, she ran 
through the gates of the outer wall and sucked up the cool afternoon air 
of the &#39;outside world&#39;. It seemed like the end of the day would never 
come.

Once Midori was out on the main road she slowed down a bit. Thinking 
back to her earlier success. It would have never happened if not for 
Setsuna. There had to be something that she could do to thank her. 
Because of that thing with the report, they couldn&#39;t get to go to the 
new arcade in Shinjuku. But simply taking Setsuna there now seemed... 
inadequate. There had to be something more that she could do for Setsuna 
to show how grateful she was. Right now there was nothing she could 
think of. But if she went down to the nearest high street, maybe she 
could find something that would show just how much she appreciated 
Setsuna&#39;s help. 

Which was exactly what she did. By running (Midori&#39;s preferred choice of 
travel) the teen bounded across the streets and roads and made her way 
right into the heart of the current district. The girl spent the 
following hour touring through all the malls and individual shops around 
that it could offer. Normally Midori hated shopping with a passion 
(another arguably un-feminine trait she possessed) but a present for 
Setsuna came first. Eventually the tomboy found herself staring into the 
glass of a jewellery shop. Her eyes scanned over all the rich items of 
gold, silver, ruby, diamond and the like. Although all of it was so 
expensive. And Midori wasn&#39;t exactly rich... by any standard. 

Midori heaved a sigh. &quot;Dammit! Why is everything in this town so 
expensive? I gotta get a gift for Yuki. But my cash flow is so weak 
that-&quot;

&quot;AAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!&quot;

A blood-curdling scream drew in the attention of everyone around, 
including Midori. The flowing length of her white headband whipped 
around her shoulders as she turned around to see what the problem was. 
In the middle of the shopping plaza was a small, broken crowd. Each of 
them had haunted and frightened expressions on their faces as they 
watched what was happening between the three people at the centre of the 
group. Two men and one woman. The woman stood at the side, still 
screaming, as she watched what went on between the two men she stood 
nearest to. One of them was draped in a huge cloak, obscuring his face 
and body from view. But out from that cloak protruded a long, very thin 
blade, the colour of blood. And it was lodged right the abdomen of the 
other man. With one swift jerk, the sword-wielding mystery ripped the 
weapon from the shorter male, who then collapsed dead upon the cold 
floor of the Tokyo streets. Once a pool of blood began to spread from 
the body, the crowds around fled in terror amid screams and crying. 
Someone had actually been killed in broad daylight. Who on earth could 
do such a thing? 

Midori narrowed her eyes. &quot;Damn. This would have to happen when I&#39;m 
making an effort to shop, right? I swear, my luck sucks. Well... I 
suppose someone&#39;s gotta deal with this before it gets out of hand...&quot;

The man in the cloak gripped the large piece of clothing in one hand and 
pulled it straight off his body. It came down to the ground slowly, 
revealing the killer in all his glory. A lean, thin man, clearly of 
western origin. Maybe English. Possessed of scruffy, un-brushed hair 
beaming the colours of white and blue, a pair of firm leather trousers 
that clung to his legs tightly, and dark black bracers around his 
wrists. Most glaring of all this man&#39;s traits was the tattoo across his 
chest. 

A tattoo of an inverted pentacle. 

From his cruel, humoured face came a dark grin. &quot;Wonderful! The smell of 
blood! The breaking of bone! The slashing of flesh! I&#39;m gonna carve you 
all up with this Shahal!&quot;

&quot;...Well done...&quot; And surprisingly enough, the sword had its own voice 
too, &quot;...Linedwell Rainrix... you have passed...the test... set for 
you.&quot;

But before Lie could move on to kill someone or something else, a 
cross-armed Midori stood before him, devoid of the fear that those other 
people had. Or that anyone else would have expected. In particular, Lie 
himself. 

Midori shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t normally get involved in this sort of 
thing. But then again... this isn&#39;t exactly normal, is it? But I suggest 
you stop while you&#39;re ahead, man. I&#39;m pretty pumped up right now... so 
I&#39;m not beyond kicking your ass all over the street.&quot;

The psychotic English rocker scowled at her. &quot;Don&#39;t be so arrogant. 
You&#39;re no match for me. No one is! With Shahal, I can kill God himself!&quot;

&quot;Damn. You&#39;re as crazy as you are ugly.&quot;

&quot;Crazy!?&quot; Lie repeated angrily, &quot;Ugly?! I&#39;ll kill you a hundred times!&quot;

His action was swift. One second Lie stood with an irate expression on 
his face, the next he was lunging forwards, straight at Midori. The 
younger woman blinked and let all of her years of training kick in, 
vaulting upwards with the sudden stroke of motion. Shahal was shot 
straight under her legs, missing the mark of the charge. But Midori knew 
better than to think of that as a mini-victory. As her lithe body 
rotated backwards mid-air, she took the time to study the fighter below 
her. For such a feeble looking person, this &#39;Linedwell Rainrix&#39; had a 
bit of speed to his name. And although it might not be the most 
opportune time to test out her new techniques... she might as well give 
it a shot. Midori&#39;s red trainers placed her firmly into the ground upon 
descent, re-assuming her natural Fuin fighting stance. 

She smiled. &quot;Not bad. You&#39;re not all talk, are you?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m gonna do much worse than that, girl. Yes, I&#39;m gonna do much 
worse! With this Shahal, I can slice you into ribbons! You hear me?! 
Ribbons!&quot; 

Following that, Midori gave the time to spread her arms from one side of 
her body to the other. She took a moment to focus her Ki (A/N, I know 
the EZ Encyclopaedia spells it &#39;Kay&#39; but I just don&#39;t like how that 
looks. Go figure.) slipping her eyelids shut and concentrating her mind 
on the task. Then came the money-maker. As she re-opened her eyes, 
Midori thrust both of her lissom arms forwards, in a sort of &#39;pushing&#39; 
motion, which conjured a powerful orb of intense sapphire blue energy. 
The power ball was thrown straight at the English Rocker, whom only 
sneered at it. The second that the power ball reached within striking 
range of him, Lie brought up Shahal and mounted his defence. Placing the 
blade in an awkward looking position over his face and chest, the power 
ball collided brutally with Shahal; the sound of the clashing ringing in 
both fighters&#39; ears. Lie grit his teeth and held his own against the 
power ball as it sought to smash his defence. His feet skidded back 
along the stone pavement of the plaza, waking traces of dust. His wild 
azure-white hair was blown back as a sort of vacuum was created around 
the stand-off. Midori kept her hands forwards as she watched her attack 
being held off in such a manner. But it didn&#39;t last. The glint of anger 
in Lie&#39;s eyes became a flash of pure rage, as he sliced both upwards and 
downwards in two solid, swift actions. The first slash broke the 
power-vacuum created from the clash, and the second one went straight 
through the power ball. The attack forged of pure Ki was broken into 
glittering pieces that slowly fell to the ground. 

Of course, Midori didn&#39;t begrudge it... &quot;Now!&quot;

Her trained body form leapt straight into the air. But with a greater 
sense of dedication and a stronger feel of speed. Midori&#39;s torso 
vanished into a blur, leaving behind no trace of her at that specific 
point. However she reappeared behind the taller, meaner Lie, leg 
outstretched, teeth grinding together. Lie cast his eyes back after 
hearing a growl from behind him. The second he did so, Midori&#39;s scuffed 
red shoe was planted firmly in his face with a vicious slapping sound. 
The older man then groaned as Midori&#39;s momentum forced him backwards in 
that very position, skidding across the plaza with her foot still lodged 
in his cheek. Once she realized that she had ridden out most of her 
impetus, Midori rotated her body from the hips, dragging her free leg 
around her other. This second kick struck with more force than the first 
one. It was enough to send Lie straight out of striking range. The 
murderous wielder of the Shahal groaned again as Midori&#39;s second kick 
drove him into the dust of the stone floor, knocking him for six. Midori 
soon landed from that attack, with a bright (some might say 
over-confident) smile on her face. 

She rested a palm on her hips. &quot;You&#39;re quick, man. But you&#39;re also kinda 
fragile...&quot;

Lie dragged his legs under him, and pressed upwards with his thin arms. 
Shahal was still locked in his grip. But now his shifty face was 
decorated with two matching bruises, swiftly turning the colours of blue 
and purple. A vein soon began throbbing at the temple of his head, and 
he swiftly looked back at the arrogant Japanese girl who had done this 
to him. 

&quot;You!&quot; He bellowed, irate, &quot;I&#39;m gonna kill you! I swear I&#39;ll make you 
suffer for this! I swear that I will! I&#39;ll make you regret the day you 
ever met me! You hear me!? Do you hear me!?&quot;

Midori shook her head. &quot;Geez man, do you ever stop nattering? Threats 
like that are kinda worthless if you can&#39;t back &#39;um up. So you might 
wanna think about throwing in the towel.&quot;

By this time, Lie had gotten back up to his feet, with a furious look on 
him. He was now in the dangerous position of looking ridiculous. Some 
Japanese upstart running rings around him? Impossible! No one could 
defeat a man who stood against the might of the Tenpouin Clan! He was 
invincible! Lie wiped the little trickle of blood that was coming down 
from the corner of his mouth, then pointed Shahal at his newest enemy. 
Himeno Midori.

&quot;You&#39;re dead!&quot; He screamed, &quot;I&#39;m gonna carve you into oblivion! I&#39;ll 
destroy you a thousand times over! Yes, a thousand times over!&quot;

Midori re-assumed her stance. Not uttering a word, just smiling. But by 
this time, Lie was through playing around. The Englishman flicked the 
sword into his other hand and poised it behind him. The tip of Shahal 
then did something amazing. It made a tear. But not just any ordinary 
tear, like that of fabric or muscle, this was a tear in reality. In time 
and space. Lie&#39;s action ripped open a divide of reality, shaped like a 
small black hole. Midori was suddenly overwhelmed by confusion as Lie 
thrust his hand straight into that tear. A second tear appeared right in 
front of her. And abruptly, Midori was struck by something she could 
hardly register in her mind.  

&quot;Ah!&quot; The girl gave a surprisingly feminine cry as she was blown back by 
the force of whatever had hit her. Knocking her from the readiness she 
assumed she had. Lie pulled his hand out of the black hole which soon 
sealed itself. He simply scowled at this new found opening and ran ahead 
with another ramming charge. He pulled back the mighty sword of the 
Cocutos, then reared up over Midori with all the speed she had seen 
before. He brought down the blade and gave one swift slash. Curved. 
Midori&#39;s eyes widened with both shock and pain, as the thin edge of 
Shahal cut straight through her blue tank top and down to the middle of 
her midriff. Things seem to slow down at that point, as blood was hurled 
into the air and a grin finally returned to Lie. The two separated from 
each other; both possessing different feelings from the outcome of the 
strike.

&quot;...D-Damn...&quot; Midori skidded back across the ground, gripping the 
bloody bottom half of her elongated body wound, &quot;I... underestimated his 
speed again...&quot; 

Once again, Lie pointed the Shahal at the weakened Midori. &quot;What 
happened to all of your arrogance?! You fool! I&#39;m powerful! Now you know 
I&#39;m very powerful! This is just the beginning of all the pain you&#39;ll 
suffer! Yes, this is just the beginning!&quot;

Midori slipped one of her eyes shut. Then focused on Lie again. She had 
been careless. To let her guard down like that was a mistake. But she 
couldn&#39;t just fold now. Not with the Keisho Ritual ahead of her. The 
young woman kneeled down, but pulled up her right arm. She spread her 
palm open and focused. It was time for the Fuin Gensui. That would be 
enough to knock this guy out, surely? Regardless of the possibilities, a 
faint green glow began to encircle Midori&#39;s hand. Lie rotated his head 
around his shoulders and relished the sound of the joints cracking 
against each other. There was no way he was going to allow himself to be 
fooled again by this little girl. The inverted pentacle tattoo upon his 
chest soon began glowing too. The colour of pure blue. And unlike 
Midori&#39;s attacks, Lie&#39;s took very little time to charge. Soon enough, a 
huge blast of sparkling pressure burst from his chest. The surge of raw 
power moved with slow but enormous energies. Midori&#39;s eyes widened at 
it. The process of gathering energy for the Fuin Gensui was taking too 
long. She couldn&#39;t be sure that she could complete the attack before 
Lie&#39;s wave struck her. But if she dodged she would lose all the energy 
she had gathered so far. She had to play it safe. Midori abandoned the 
Fuin Gensui and roughly jumped to one side of the incoming energy wave. 
It zoomed past her and collided with a now abandoned ice cream cart just 
a short eleven metres away. The following explosion forced a huge wave 
of dust away from the blast point, leaving behind a flaming pile of 
metal and plastic. Midori soon looked away from that; but all too late. 
Her eyes widened again when a second wave, this time the colour of blood 
red, came straight for her. The tomboy swiftly brought up both of her 
hands as a fragile defence. Bright crimson light engulfed her 
completely. With her reserves of Ki, her spiritual energy, she enhanced 
the defence to protect her wrists from the burn. But she would not be 
able to hold this off for very long. Midori grit her teeth and struggled 
as best she could to hold off Lie&#39;s attack. In the end; Midori was 
forced right off her feet and sent straight behind. Her body was carried 
with the wave and thrown all the way over to the wall of a nearby shoe 
store. With a loud bang, she was blasted into the wall, the stone of it 
shattering to make way for the new layer of flesh pressed against it. 
Once the red light of Lie&#39;s wave died away, Midori was left in the 
shallow wall crater. Unconscious, bruised, and her head tilting to one 
side of her body. 

Lie grinned again. &quot;You weakling! No one is a match for me! That&#39;s 
right! No one! I&#39;ll kill everyone with my Shahal! Yes, I&#39;ll kill you all 
with my-&quot;

&quot;Firebird Attack!&quot;

Before Lie could finish his sentence, a great luminosity of blue 
approached from behind. He turned around to meet with whatever it was, 
and saw it. A bird of great beauty, born of pure spirit power, flying 
towards him with a strength that transcended anything he could have 
imagined from a simple human being like himself. The Englishman cried 
out with frustration as the Firebird Attack rammed into him with almost 
unnatural furiousness. His grip was weakened for just a brief second, 
but it was enough to completely knock the Shahal out of his hands. And 
that, in effect, was the TRUE source of his power. Just ahead stood the 
conjurer of the attack, the Guardian Angel herself, prepared for battle 
with her prodigious Klau Solas in hand. 

Saizuki Setsuna. 

Rather than focus on the downed Lie, Setsuna reverted attention and ran 
straight over to Midori. Whom was still unconscious over by the battered 
wall of the shoe shop. As soon as Setsuna reached Midori, she crouched 
down and took the taller girl into her arms, placing Klau Solas down 
beforehand. 

&quot;Midori?!&quot; Setsuna yelled, tears in her eyes, &quot;Midori!? Please say 
something!&quot;

The beautiful spectre of Karin rose from Setsuna&#39;s body, sensing that 
the danger and flow of miasma had weakened. {She will be fine, Setsuna. 
Her injuries don&#39;t look overwhelmingly serious. But we should take her 
somewhere to have them treated.} 

Setsuna held Midori&#39;s cheek to her own. &quot;...I know. I can&#39;t believe I 
got here so late. I should have protected her... I should have listened 
to you when you said that... the surge of miasma was stronger than 
usual...&quot;

Though there was no possible way for Setsuna to have actually felt it, 
the compassionate Karin placed her ghostly transparent palm upon 
Setsuna&#39;s shoulder. {...It&#39;s not your fault. Please don&#39;t blame yourself 
for this. Blame lies with that man and that man alone.}

Setsuna then cast her eyes at Lie. &quot;Who... who was he? When I sensed the 
flow of miasma... it felt even stronger than that of Vice... but now...&quot;

{...He is nobody.} Karin offered, {...Just a weak shell. The power came 
from the sword and only the sword.}

That was good to know. But there was no time to waste now, thinking of 
Lie and the Shahal. Setsuna had to get Midori treated. Especially to 
patch up that nasty gash across her stomach and chest.  &quot;...Oh, 
Midori...&quot;
