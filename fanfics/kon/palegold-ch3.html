<h2>a <a href="../kon/index.html">K-ON!</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/museless.html">Museless</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kon/palegold-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><p align="center"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"><u>Chapter 3:  
Mio speaks up</u></font> <br> <br> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">“Mugi.” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Mugi-sempai!” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi was currently in a Sawako 
induced daze suddenly came to her senses when she felt a hand on her 
shoulder. She looked up from her keyboard to see Azusa, concern written 
on her face. She wasn&#39;t the only one. The other members of Afternoon 
Tea Time were looking at Mugi worriedly. </font> <br> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Mugi-sempai, 
are you alright?” Azusa voiced what they all wanted to ask. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Oh 
my, Yes! My apologies everyone, I&#39;m not quite sure where my head is 
today, forgive me.” She answered their looks with a beatific smile, 
her hands clasped together in front of her chest.  The band members 
looked at each other then shrugged. If Mugi said she was fine, then 
she must be. Everyone seemed convinced except Mio and Azusa but they 
went back to their instruments anyway. As her fingers picked the first 
notes from her bass, Mio decided she would talk with Mugi in private. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">They played through a set of songs, 
this time without any interruptions or incidents. Because they were 
now alumni and not students, the girls could not use the clubroom anymore. 
Luckily,  Mio&#39;s parents suggested they could use the Akiyamas&#39; 
garage until they left for university. Thankful about the generous offer 
from Mio&#39;s parents the band decided to have practice Sunday and also 
pay the family a visit to thank them personally. Everyone arrived expecting 
to meet the Akiyamas but Mio informed them her parents were out that 
day. Not surprisingly Mugi brought sweets and so they sat around Mio&#39;s 
living room after band practice enjoying tea and different desserts. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Before they all left Mio casually 
asked Mugi if she could stay for a little longer. She explained she 
wanted some help with the new lyrics and musical arrangement. Mugi, 
eager to please, assented. The others left, Ritsu and Yui charging towards 
the door with plans to visit an arcade after eating said sweets. Azusa 
trailed behind them reluctantly, delegated to the role of keeping the 
two in order even though she was younger. </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi and Mio got to work immediately 
and the musical arrangement worked out well enough between the two. 
Mio, being Mio couldn&#39;t say what was on her mind however as they finished 
up. She told herself that she wanted to make sure Mugi was fine, she 
wasn&#39;t just being nosy and it was time to speak up or else the blonde 
would leave. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Er...Mugi...” 
She asked hesitatingly.</font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Yes, 
Mio-chan?” Mugi answered promptly, her blue eyes reflecting happiness 
at being able to help a friend. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">I 
was...ah...” Mio stumbled, still not sure if this was the right thing 
to do. Then again, Mugi was her friend and she wanted to know. She took 
a deep breath, her face red. She looked down. “I...wanted to know 
if you are really alright. You&#39;ve never zoned out like that when we 
practice. It&#39;s unusual for you.” She looked up to see Mugi&#39;s beaming 
face. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Thank 
you so much for being worried, Mio. You really are a good friend.” 
The other girl blushed at her words. “Everything is fine. Wonderful 
in fact, I couldn&#39;t be happier.” The blonde leaned forward in a confidential 
manner, her blue eyes twinkling. “Can I tell you something?” </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mio nodded, her raven hair waving 
behind her. “Of course, anything!” She blurted, in order to redeem 
herself for being so nosy. Then she blanched internally as she thought, <i>
&#39;Wait, anything?&#39; </i>Mugi wasn&#39;t like Ritsu but who knows what she 
might say...Mio quickly squashed the thought and paid attention to her 
friend. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">I 
was out with Sawako-sensei yesterday.” At Mio&#39;s blank look, the blonde 
elaborated, “As in a date.” Mugi glowed with happiness, continuing 
“The truth is, I&#39;m really in love with her.” </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mio shivered as she remembered 
all the times Sawako caused her trauma one way or another. <i>&#39;That 
madwoman?!&#39; </i>She sighed to herself as she looked at her friend. Despite 
the Sawako&#39;s actions towards Mio, she really must be doing something 
right if her friend looked that happy. Putting aside her bias against 
the teacher, she clasped Mugi&#39;s hands in her own. “Does she feel the 
same way towards you?” The blonde girl nodded enthusiastically. Smiling, 
she stated simply, “I&#39;m happy for you.” Mio meant it as well. All 
the years she had known Mugi, she had seen her content or pleased but 
never happy the way she looked at that moment. </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi hugged Mio on impulse. “Thank 
you Mio! You have no idea how much those words  mean to me.” 
She drew back, slightly teary eyed and Mio fidgeted at the emotion. 
“You&#39;re the first person I&#39;ve told. It feels good to say it out loud.” </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Not 
that I&#39;m objecting to your relationship but what&#39;s going to happen when 
we go to university? And what about your parents? Are you going to tell 
them?” Mio&#39;s panic for Mugi bubbled up, allowing her to blurt out 
the fears already running rampant in her head. Because Mio, being Mio, 
always worried.</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">A frown marred Mugi&#39;s features 
as she considered Mio&#39;s questions. It wasn&#39;t like she hadn&#39;t thought 
about these things, it just seemed unimportant for now. Yet she knew 
the time was short before their entry to a new school. </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Time 
is passing by quickly. Three years ago I met you and Ritsu and Yui and 
we became a band, even better, we became friends along with Azusa. Three 
years can seem like a long time to some people, but to me it passed 
by so quickly. Maybe it felt that way because of all the fun times and 
memories we share. In a few weeks, we&#39;re heading towards a place where 
we will have to make choices for ourselves. We can never step back. 
We&#39;ll be adults. I want to experience all those things with my friends 
at my side. And Sawako-sensei as well because I don&#39;t want to regret 
any moment.” Mugi smiled gently as she spoke. </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Sawako-sensei 
and I will be apart, yes. But we won&#39;t be that far apart that we&#39;ll 
never see each other. We can always compromise and meet halfway. As 
for my parents...I&#39;ll tell them soon. I&#39;d rather they didn&#39;t go through 
all the effort of setting up marriage meetings.” Mio seemed a bit 
shocked by Mugi&#39;s words but didn&#39;t say anything. </font> <br>

 <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">It&#39;s 
selfish isn&#39;t it?” Asked Mugi, after a moment.</font> <br> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">No! 
Not at all! Your happiness is important. B-But considering the type 
of relationship...It&#39;s just...Not all parents are supportive.” Mio 
answered quickly. Mugi sensed Mio had put a lot of thought into that 
idea. </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">I 
just don&#39;t want to live with regret, Mio-chan.” Mugi sighed. So did 
Mio.</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">I 
didn&#39;t think you were this brave Mugi.” Mio admitted, gazing at the 
blonde as if seeing her in a whole new light. </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi got ready to leave. “Anyone 
can be brave Mio-chan. You just have to want whatever it is that will 
bring you happiness badly enough.” </font> <br> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">They hugged each other before 
saying goodbye at the door. Before Mio could close it Mugi turned to 
the raven haired girl. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">You 
should tell her. It&#39;s much better than wracking your brains with &#39;what 
ifs&#39;?” Mio stood there gaping long after Mugi walked off. Suddenly 
she realized the neighbors might have seen her like that. She flushed 
beet red and closed the door quickly, Mugi&#39;s words echoing in her ears 
hours after.  </font></p>
