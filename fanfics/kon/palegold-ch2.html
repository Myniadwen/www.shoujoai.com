<a href="../kon/palegold-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a>  <p align="center"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"><u>Chapter 2: A 
Date, First Date in Fact.</u></font> <br> <br> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS"><i>Mugi, 
I love you.” Sawako whispered, her breath tickling the young woman. 
Her arms were wrapped around Mugi, the girl&#39;s head resting on Sawako&#39;s 
shoulder. When Sawako spoke her voice teased Mugi&#39;s skin and sent shivers 
up her spine. They were in the clubroom again, tea for two on the pushed 
together desks. The school was quiet, light from the setting sun cast 
a golden glow on everything it touched. Mugi&#39;s heart thundered in her 
chest and slowly a deep ache was starting to build within her. </i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"><i>I 
love you too, Sensei.” </i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"><i>She looked up into Sawako&#39;s 
eyes and saw an echo of the desire she felt inside. Deciding that was 
enough of an answer she pressed her body against the older woman and 
kissed her on the lips. Sawako kissed her back, her soft lips insistent, 
forceful even. Behind her closed eyelids, colors exploded and her hands 
grabbed at Sawako&#39;s back. Her hands clutched at the woman&#39;s blouse, 
wishing they were naked in order to feel Sawako&#39;s soft skin under her 
fingers. </i></font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"><i>The teacher&#39;s tongue glided 
over Mugi&#39;s lips and invaded her mouth. The girl returned the kiss with 
fervor. She gasped as she felt Sawako&#39;s hand on her breast suddenly. 
Mugi didn&#39;t pull away, instead she placed her hand atop Sawako&#39;s to 
show her that yes, this was what she wanted. Their lips finally separated, 
each panting for air, Sawako still kneading Mugi&#39;s breast. She leaned, 
placing a kiss on the girl&#39;s neck as she did so and Mugi groaned. Her 
hands traveled up to the teacher&#39;s head and she plunged her hands into 
the autumn colored mane, grabbing fistfuls of hair to keep her close.</i></font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS"><i>Sennn...sei...” 
She moaned as Sawako bit her neck lightly before she placed a trail 
of kisses leading to Mugi&#39;s lips again. Mugi took the offensive this 
time, slipping her tongue between Sawako&#39;s lips, her feelings for the 
older woman poured into the kiss. They broke apart and Mugi whimpered 
as Sawako pushed her away. She almost protested until she noticed Sawako 
had undone the ribbon at her neck and was eagerly unbuttoning the young 
woman&#39;s shirt. The woman pushed her until she was laying back on the 
makeshift table with the teacups, blazer and shirt opened, her bra exposed. </i></font> 
<br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Sawako bore a smirk as she 
kissed the bare skin behind Mugi&#39;s left ear before working her way down 
to her collar. Mugi&#39;s breath hitched in her throat as Sawako moved lower 
slowly. The ache in her was full force now. She could feel Sawako breathing 
against her breasts. Her nipples responded, standing at attention through 
the thin fabric of her lacy undergarment. Sawako gently bit down on 
a nipple through the cloth and Mugi cried out. </i></font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Sawako looked up at her and 
asked teasingly,”Isn&#39;t this what you want, </i>
Ojou-sama<i>?” Mugi moaned again, loudly as Sawako bent over her again-</i></font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">“Ojou-sama!!” </font> <br>
 <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi&#39;s eyes flew open as she realized 
a maid was knocking on her door while calling out to her. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Yes?” 
She answered rather shakily, trying to catch her breath as she sat up. </font> <br>
 <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Are 
you okay in there, Ojou-sama? It sounded as if you were having a bad 
dream.” The maid asked, apparent concern in her voice. Mugi never 
cursed in her entire life but she was tempted to at that exact moment. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">N-No, 
no. Everything is fine.” She sighed as she buried her hot face in 
her hands. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, 
please excuse me, I&#39;ll be going then.” Doubt was very much evident 
in the maid&#39;s voice but what could she do but listen to her young mistress 
and let her be.  Footsteps retreated down the corridor and Mugi 
flopped back onto the bed as she thought back to the dream. Her heartbeat 
doubled as her face flushed, her hand tentatively atop the breast     
Sawako kissed in the dream. What she wouldn&#39;t give to experience the 
dream in its entirety.  She&#39;d never be able to look at Sawako again 
without remembering the kisses and touching. But the most persistent 
thing at the moment was the throbbing between her legs. She looked at 
the clock; six-thirty a.m. </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">She sighed again and thought to 
herself, &#39;<i>I guess it isn&#39;t too early to take a cold shower.&#39;  </i></font> 
<br>
 <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">It was a Saturday. Graduation 
was a few days ago and Mugi had completed all preparations for university. 
All that was left was to enjoy the rest of the break. Mugi had not seen 
Sawako since graduation day although they kept in contact via emails. 
She was tempted to email Sawako but it was still very early.  She 
wasn&#39;t very sleepy after the cold shower and so she decided to have 
breakfast and play around on her keyboard. She ate very little of the 
western style omelette the chef prepared. Although it was delicious, 
she couldn&#39;t taste a thing. Her mind kept recounting the dream and so 
all she could think of were Sawako&#39;s hands and lips everywhere. While 
it wasn&#39;t the first dream she had of Sawako, it was the first of its 
kind. In the other dreams they exchanged chaste kisses. </font> <br>
 <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Her phone vibrated in her pocket. 
She gasped and dropped her chopsticks. The sound of the utensils clattered 
against the dish as Mugi scrambled for her phone. The maid in attendant 
raised a questioning eyebrow. Although curious, she knew better than 
to ask why the ojou-sama was acting so strangely today. Then it struck 
her that perhaps the young lady was in love. She smiled to herself and 
stole a glance at her young mistress. The look on Mugi&#39;s face confirmed 
the maid&#39;s guess. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi&#39;s smile was radiant, her 
eyes sparkling as she looked at the phone. It was a message from Sawako, 
it read; <i>Good morning Mugi-chan, sorry to disturb you so early. Do 
you have anything planned today? If not, would you like to spend it 
with me? </i>She wasted no time in responding to Sawako, notifying the 
woman that yes, she was free and yes, she would love to spend the day 
with her. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Sawako wrote back, <i>Great!I 
will pick you up in an hour. Dress casually.</i></font> <br> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi perused her closet, regretting 
the fact that she did not have any jeans unlike her other friends. She 
decided on a simple white skirt that reached mid-calf, comfortable sandals 
and a short sleeved pale blue top. She completed the look by putting 
up her hair in a ponytail. She finished dressing just as Sawako pulled 
up into the driveway. Grabbing her purse she bid farewell to the butler, 
informing him that she&#39;d be out the entire day; not to worry about any 
meals. He bowed before closing the door behind her. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">She walked briskly to Sawako&#39;s 
car and got in quickly, thrilled to be so close to the woman. She would 
have kissed her on the lips but decided against it since they were still 
sitting in plain view of the courtyard. There were too many eyes about. 
She was also too shy to instigate such a move so early. She flushed 
pink at her thoughts but smiled brightly at Sawako.  The older 
woman tilted her head, her rich brown eyes twinkling as they met Mugi&#39;s. 
“Good morning, Mugi-chan. You look very nice.” She reached over 
and grasped the younger woman&#39;s hand gently, squeezing. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi&#39;s face felt red hot as she 
choked out a response of thanks. The touch of the older woman brought 
the dream back full force and she didn&#39;t trust herself to say anything 
else. The nerve endings of her hand where Sawako touched her suddenly 
felt electrified.  Sawako still wore the same smile she greeted 
Mugi with as she let go before placing both hands back on the wheel 
and driving off. </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">They were already out of the Kotobuki 
estate and a few blocks away when Mugi finally spoke.  “Ah, Sensei, 
what are we doing today?” Sawako looked pleased at her question. “It&#39;s 
a surprise.” She answered a moment later. “So, did you sleep well 
Mugi?” The girl gasped at the question, <i>&#39;it was if Sawako had read 
her mind!&#39;, </i>she thought.</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">The woman turned to look at her 
and noticed her bright red face. “I slept fine Sensei, thank you.” 
She answered thinking perhaps at a later date she might share the contents 
of her dream. Sawako sensed Mugi held something back but she wouldn&#39;t 
push her. <i>Not now anyway,</i> she smirked to herself internally. 
She lowered the windows of the vehicle as they entered the highway, 
the breeze catching her hair, strands snapping and dancing in the wind. 
She looked over at Mugi.</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Do 
you mind?” She asked. Mugi had a smile of wonderment on her face as 
she stared at Sawako. She shook her head and simply answered, “No, 
it&#39;s beautiful today. The breeze feels good.” Sawako suddenly felt 
like laughing as the wind snapped at her clothing. She reached over 
and took Mugi&#39;s hand in her own and the girl tightened her grip. She 
did laugh out loud this time. She usually loved the feeling of driving 
with her windows down but today felt flawless, with Mugi&#39;s warm hand 
in her own as they sped down the highway. </font> <br> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi had never felt so happy, 
the sun was out, the wind not too cool. She had come very close to this 
feeling, with her friends especially after they successfully completed 
a live show. She grasped Sawako&#39;s free hand in both of her own  
and continued staring at the beautiful woman&#39;s profile. Slowly her lids 
lowered, a most content smile on her face.</font> <br> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi awoke to the sound of waves 
crashing upon the shore. She wondered where she was,  certainly 
not on her bed. Her bed had never felt so warm and comforting before 
with arms wrapping about her...</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Arms?! </i>
She thought to herself as she struggled to sit upright. The top of her 
head connected with something hard.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Oww!!” 
</font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi looked around, horrified 
to see Sawako clutching her chin. “Sensei!!” She cried out, reaching 
out to help while noting faint pain atop her head. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Sawako tried to smile at her reassuringly, 
but her eyebrow twitched. She then saw the distress on Mugi&#39;s face and 
shook her annoyance at the pain away. It hadn&#39;t been Mugi&#39;s fault, she 
was startled awake after all. She rubbed her chin, assuring the girl 
that it was fine. Mugi pulled her hands away so she could get a better 
look. </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">I&#39;m 
so sorry, Sawako-sensei!” She gently brushed the teacher&#39;s chin. The 
skin around the area was a little red but fine otherwise. Mugi impulsive 
leaned in and kissed the red skin. Instead of pulling away she kissed 
it again, this time the contact between her lips and Sawako&#39;s skin lasting 
longer. Her breathing slowed as the woman&#39;s hand came up behind her 
head, lifting it so they could look into each others eyes. Blue met 
brown, both drifting closed slowly as their lips came together. Sawako 
shifted in order to find a more comfortable position while pulling Mugi 
closer to her. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">They broke apart when Sawako&#39;s 
elbow pressed against the car horn and a blast of sound interrupted 
them. Sitting up and looking around sheepishly, they check to see if 
anyone  noticed the cacophony. Mugi giggled at the silliness of 
the situation before she realized she was staring into the bluest sky, 
waves dashing about at its feet. She looked at Sawako and the woman 
grinned at her. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Well, 
what are we waiting for? Let&#39;s go!” She opened her door and hopped 
out, then waited for Mugi to get out as well before she took off towards 
the waves. Mugi followed at a more sedate pace, eying the way Sawako&#39;s 
jeans clung to her rear. She was in this beautiful place and all she 
could notice was the teacher. She smiled to herself, pleased at the 
woman&#39;s exuberance. Sawako turned around and noticed Mugi&#39;s slow pace. 
She came back and grabbed the younger woman&#39;s hand, walking side by 
side with her this time. </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">They walked down to the sand, 
Mugi glancing at Sawako before she spoke. “It&#39;s so pretty here, thank 
you for bringing me.” Sawako looked down at her feet, a rare bashful 
expression on her face as she contemplated the reason why she loved 
this particular beach. Romance was not her forte despite being a few 
years older than Mugi. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"><i>“You&#39;re welcome.” She glanced 
at Mugi and then away, “I used to come here often with my friends 
in high school. It was like a second home.” She continued her voice 
softer, “But it&#39;s only lately that I realized the blue of the sky 
and water reminds me of your eyes.” She didn&#39;t look at the girl as 
she admitted the last part. Mugi didn&#39;t say anything and Sawako berated 
herself, Geez, you cornball! How cheesy was that shit?! </i>
She looked at the waves, at the sand, anywhere but the girl and was 
surprised when she felt a pair of arms wrap around her waist. Mugi was 
hugging her. She hugged back. They stood there for a while, simply enjoying 
the feeling of each other as the wind blew over and around them. The 
sun shone down on their heads and seagulls screeched, vying to be heard 
over the sound of the waves. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">A large rumble erupted from Mugi&#39;s 
midsection and the girl pulled back, her face the reddest Sawako had 
ever seen. Sawako snickered and Mugi&#39;s giggles filled the air. “Gomen...I 
didn&#39;t eat much this morning.” </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Let&#39;s 
have lunch.” Sawako said simply as she drew the younger woman back 
to the car. </font> <br> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">They continued down the road in 
the same direction they traveled earlier and Mugi was surprised to find 
Sawako was pulling over not ten minutes later. A low-slung building 
sat about a hundred feet away.  The sign outside said ramen in 
big chalk letters. They walked towards the ramen shop, the breeze and 
the blue ocean at their backs. As they entered the establishment a man 
in the back looked up and caught sight of Sawako. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Well, 
well, if it isn&#39;t Sawa-chan!” </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">The teacher smiled and called 
out in mock incredulity  “Oji-san, you&#39;re still here making lousy 
ramen?!” </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">The man smirked and shot back, 
“And you&#39;re still a brat!” They laughed as Mugi stood to the side, 
smiling as she witnessed the good-natured exchange. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Ooh, 
but who is this cute ojou-chan?” The man asked as he switched his 
attention to Mugi. She bowed politely and introduced herself. Sawako 
added they were visiting the beach and couldn&#39;t leave without stopping 
to get some of the best ramen she ever had. The man nodded, smiling 
and got to work preparing their food.  They chose a table near 
a window and chatted about nothing in particular while waiting for their 
food. A young girl Mugi&#39;s age came over to ask what they wanted to drink. 
Sawako decided to have a beer and Mugi wondered if she should try one 
as well. Sawako shrugged her shoulders in a be my guest gesture although 
she had a feeling Mugi might not like the taste of the beverage. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">To Sawako&#39;s surprise Mugi drank 
the entire bottle although it took her the whole meal to finish it. 
Mugi&#39;s streak of determination surprised Sawako but what surprised her 
more was the fact that girl was such a lightweight. A pink hue graced 
her cheeks and she giggled at everything Sawako said while they ate. 
The older woman would have found it annoying if it was another girl 
but because it was Mugi she found it cute. Although she did vow to herself 
to keep Mugi away from anything stronger.  They said goodbye to 
the oji-san, Mugi thanking him for the wonderful ramen. He made them 
promise to visit again before letting them walk out the door. </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi leaned on the other woman 
as they walked to the car. “Sawa-chan?” </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"><i>&#39;Sawa-chan&#39;?! </i>
She had a feeling of deja-vu but brushed it aside to answer, “Yes, 
Mugi?” The girl had her eyes closed, her cheeks still flushed with 
pink.  </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Let&#39;s 
go play in the water!” Blue eyes met hers,a little dazed but happiness 
shone through. She couldn&#39;t refuse her if she tried. She kissed the 
tip of Mugi&#39;s nose. “Alright, let&#39;s go!” </font> <br> <br>

 <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">They sat in the sand, Mugi&#39;s back 
braced against Sawako&#39;s front, the older woman&#39;s arms and legs around 
her. They played in the water to their hearts content, splashing each 
other but trying not to get too wet since they didn&#39;t have extra clothes. 
After they played, Sawako found a blanket in her car. It was now wrapped 
around the two of them. The effects of the beer had worn off Mugi a 
long time ago. Now they just sat and enjoyed the ocean while the setting 
sun turned everything shades of gold and orange.  </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">The light made Mugi remember the 
dream with Sawako. The feeling it brought back made her think that it 
would be alright if they did those things, in fact she&#39;d greatly enjoy 
it. She sighed. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Something 
wrong?” Sawako asked close to her ears. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">No, 
nothing&#39;s wrong.” Mugi answered sweetly, “It&#39;s just right.” Sawako 
smiled as she drew the blanket closer around them.</font> <br>
