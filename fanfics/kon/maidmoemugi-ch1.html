<h1>Maid Moe Mugi</h1>

fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;So Mugi&#39;s trying another normal retail job?&quot; Ritsu asked, the light brown haired drummer 
walking with her friend Mio down the street.

Mio Akiyama nodded, her long brown hair flowing down her back. &quot;I think she&#39;s learned her 
lesson,&quot; she said wryly, both remembering how the fast food job had gone, &quot;she&#39;s trying a 
more sedate kind of cafe.&quot;

&quot;I guess that makes sense,&quot; Yui nodded thoughtfully, her slightly messy brown hair falling 
into her eyes. The guitarist&#39;s eyes brightened, &quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll do well.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully she does better than last time,&quot; Ritsu shook her head.

The conversation stayed in Mio&#39;s mind as they separated to carry out different errands. 
Cutting through town she found herself looking around, then blinked as she recognized the 
name of the cafe that Mugi was apparently working for.

&#39;Well, I could use a break,&#39; Mio admitted as she cut across the street, walking up to the 
cafe and opening the door.

&quot;Welcome home, master!&quot; the redhead beamed, bowing then looking up to meet the frozen Mio&#39;s 
eyes. &quot;Or I should say mistress,&quot; she added cheerfully as she offered, &quot;can I take your 
coat?&quot;

Mio gulped, taking in the classic maid uniform the young lady was wearing. A long black 
dress with white apron, a little cap and ruffles galore, coupled with a figure that stood 
out even in such a simple dress.

&quot;Sure,&quot; Mio shrugged out of her heavy coat, the young woman taking it with a graceful 
gesture.

&quot;First time in a maid cafe?&quot; she asked gently.

&quot;You can tell?&quot; Mio asked, smiling back at her.

The redhead winked, &quot;I think the wide eyed shock was a hint.&quot; She lead Mio to a table as she 
continued, &quot;I&#39;m Shinobu, and I&#39;ll be serving you today, mistress.&quot;

&quot;Mio,&quot; she answered, blushing at the strange thoughts that came to mind when she heard 
mistress. &#39;I must be handing around Mugi and Sawa-sensei too much,&#39; she mused, trying to 
banish mental images of women in scary costumes carrying strange devices.

&quot;Mistress Mio,&quot; Shinobu smiled. She tilted her head to the side charmingly, &quot;Would you like 
something warm like coffee or cocoa?&quot;

Mio blushed, &quot;Cocoa, please.&quot;

&quot;Coming right up,&quot; Shinobu smiled as she turned and walked away, revealing long legs encased 
by black stockings. Her hips swayed a little as she walked, highlighting her generous 
figure.

&#39;What am I doing?!&#39; Mio blushed, looking away.

&quot;Mio?!&quot; a surprised voice cried.

Looking up Mio saw Mugi looking at her with a mildly perplexed look, also dressed in one of 
the many maid&#39;s outfits. Her light brown hair was pulled back in a ponytail, tied off by 
white ribbon while her dress was similar to Shinobu&#39;s: tight and sexy.

&quot;Mugi,&quot; Mio smiled in relief, &quot;I was looking for you. How are things going?&quot;

&quot;Very well,&quot; Mugi smiled sweetly. &quot;The manager things I might make a good &#39;ojou&#39; type maid, 
and has me serving a certain type of customer.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Mio blinked, taking a moment to process that.

&quot;Tsumugi, what are you doing here?&quot; Shinobu sounded faintly disapproving as she arrived 
carrying Mio&#39;s drink.

&quot;She&#39;s a friend of mine,&quot; Mio quickly explained to save Mugi from trouble, &quot;I actually came 
in to check on her.&quot;

Shinobu nodded, carefully setting the cup down. &quot;Do you mind if I handle Mistress Mio, Mugi? 
I did greet her after all,&quot; she pointed out reasonably.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Mugi bowed. As she left she smiled slightly, humming to herself cheerfully.

&#39;I wonder why she seems so cheerful?&#39; Mio wondered.

&quot;I also specialize in serving female maid customers,&quot; Shinobu added cheerfully as she bent 
over to pour cream into Mio&#39;s cocoa, revealing round and well shaped breasts under her short 
top.

Mio blushed, especially when Shinobu winked. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she answered with as much dignity 
as she could muster.

&quot;Mugi,&quot; Shinobu demanded as the two women paused in the kitchen, &quot;where did you find her?&quot;

&quot;You like her?&quot; Mugi asked, smiling.

&quot;She&#39;s gorgeous,&quot; Shinobu admitted with a smile, &quot;and even better, I think she&#39;s totally 
unaware of it. You know how cute that is?&quot;

&quot;I was watching you make that girl in the corner blush,&quot; a third maid noted, &quot;how cute!&quot;

&quot;She is, isn&#39;t she,&quot; Mugi agreed, her mind already racing with imagining this girl or that 
at the cafe dating Mio. She swiftly reigned herself in, reminding herself that Mio did not 
just exist to act out her various fetishes,.

&quot;So how do you know her?&quot; Shinobu asked again, looking at Mugi impatiently.

&quot;She&#39;s a friend from school,&quot; Mugi explained to her eager listeners, &quot;we&#39;re in a club 
together.&quot; Looking at Shinobu she warned her, &quot;She may look like tough, but she&#39;s really a 
very shy girl. Go easy on her, okay?&quot;

Shinobu smiled wryly, &quot;I&#39;m not going to knock her over and pounce on her, Mugi.&quot;

&quot;Not that we wouldn&#39;t love to see it!&quot; the third maid jumped in.

Shinobu pushed her gently, &quot;Down, Meiya.&quot; She looked over at Mugi, &quot;So if I want to get to 
know her, I have to be aggressive but not too aggressive?&quot;

&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Mugi agreed.

The manager stuck her head in, the pretty black haired maid smiling wryly. &quot;Who ever is in 
charge of that lack haired girl better get a move on or some other maid will grab her,&quot; she 
told them before adding, &quot;like me!&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Shinobu smiled as she hurried out, returning to Mio&#39;s side and shooing off one 
of the more determined girls.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Mio said sheepishly, &quot;she was pressing me for my phone number....&quot;

&#39;Some girls have no style,&#39; Shinobu sighed. &quot;Sorry about that,&quot; she said warmly. &quot;Would you 
like a refill?&quot;

&quot;Well...,&quot; Mio hesitated, &quot;I was going to wait for Mugi....&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll give you our special rate,&quot; Shinobu reassured her as she picked up the cup. &quot;More 
cocoa?&quot; she asked perkily.

&quot;Please,&quot; Mio agreed.

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

Mio felt a moment of confusion as she saw both Mugi and Shinobu emerge in their street 
clothes from the back of the cafe. &quot;Shinobu wanted to walk with us to the station,&quot; Mugi 
explained, &quot;would that be all right?&quot;

Mio hesitated, but the warm, shy smile that Shinobu made her wonder if the aggression she 
had shown in the cafe might be a act. &quot;Sure,&quot; she said as they started off, &quot;why not?&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Shinobu said as she gently took Mio&#39;s hand in her&#39;s.

&quot;Aren&#39;t we a little old for holding hands?&quot; Mio asked, blushing.

&quot;I&#39;m sure Mugi doesn&#39;t mind,&quot; Shinobu replied with a half smile, both of them seeing Mugi in 
a happy daze.

&#39;I think I might be in trouble,&#39; Mio thought as they walked off together.
