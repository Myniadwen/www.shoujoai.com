<h1>Pale Gold Amidst Autumn (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kon/index.html">K-ON!</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/museless.html">Museless</a><br> </h2>
  <p align="center"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"><u>Chapter 1: Tea 
With Sawako</u></font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Kotobuki Tsumugi gracefully poured 
tea for her fellow friends and band-mates calmly, the usual serene expression 
on her face belying the chaos twirling inside her. She felt like her 
insides would explode at any moment&#39;s notice. However, a proper ojou-sama 
would restrain herself and Mugi, as she was called by her friends, could 
not break the mold no matter the circumstance. She smiled as she sipped 
her tea and listened to the chatter surrounding her.  Ritsu and 
Yui were discussing the merits of chocolate cake while Mio and Azusa 
tried to direct the conversation to practice rather unsuccessfully.</font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Tomorrow the senior members of 
the Light Music Club would graduate and make their way to university 
after the break. Mugi and the others would all be going to Japan Women&#39;s 
University, thrilled that they would all be together again even in a 
different environment. While she was a bit melancholic about leaving 
the school she had come to know as her second home, the feeling sat 
on the back burner. Her wish, for the past three years would finally 
come true. The thought and joy at the prospect made everything else 
she was feeling pale in comparison. Mugi&#39;s smile increased a few watts 
as she thought back to a year ago.</font> <br> <br> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"><i>It had been a day like any 
other since Mugi started high school. Classes, band practice and teatime 
with her friends. Afterwards the girls had exited in pairs on their 
way home. First Mio and Ritsu, Mio&#39;s eyebrows twitching at some inane 
comment Ritsu spouted. Next to leave were Yui and Azusa, Yui glomping 
the kouhai as they walked out the door. While Mugi assured them it was 
fine to leave, Sawako-sensei was still drinking her tea and she&#39;d keep 
the teacher company. Yui smiled guilessly while Azusa looked at Sawako, 
then back at Mugi before she agreed.</i></font> <br> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"> <i>Mugi realized that lately 
Sawako had been staying in the room long after everyone left. It would 
be just the two of them, sitting there, drinking tea, and enjoying random 
conversation while the sun sank lower. Those days of tea and quiet murmured 
conversations filled her with happiness. She would go home,replaying 
each interaction as she laid in bed at night. It was a safe assumption 
to say she had fallen for Sawako from the first moment she met the teacher.  
The fact that Sawako was not the person she initially portrayed in school 
did nothing to  destroy the girl&#39;s feeling towards the older woman, 
it served to strengthen her affections and adoration instead. Everyone 
else might have a problem reconciling &#39;Katherine&#39; of Death Devil with 
Sawako&#39;s sweet image but Mugi gracefully accepted her as she was. </i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"> </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"><i>That day Sawako was unusually 
quiet, an unreadable look in her eyes as she glanced at Mugi. The young 
girl took a deep breath. Today was the day she would express what her 
heart had been feeling all along. Sawako, who had been sitting there 
with her legs crossed, in a totally relaxed posture and her eyes closed, 
looked over at Mugi when the young woman  spoke in her usual gentle 
manner.          </i></font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">&quot;<i>Ah, Sensei...&quot; Sawako 
smiled as encouragement for the student to go on. Mugi gulped, determined 
to speak her mind. Sawako listened attentively as Mugi bared her soul. 
She looked down once she finished speaking, her hands twitching in her 
lap, her heart beating faster than Ritsu could possibly beat on the 
drums. Her face felt incredibly hot. After speaking she couldn&#39;t look 
at Sawako, fearing the inevitable rejection. </i></font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"> &quot;<i>That was really brave 
of you Mugi.&quot; Sawako said with a smile, a faint blush on her cheeks. 
&quot;And thank you. I had a feeling you felt that way about me.&quot; 
Mugi waited for the &#39;but&#39; to fall from the teacher&#39;s lips.</i></font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">&quot;<i>Kotobuki Tsumugi, I like 
you as well.&quot; Sawako added quietly, relief on her face.</i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">&quot;<i>I underst-&quot; Mugi 
jolted up from her chair as Sawako&#39;s words sank in. Her face flushed, 
her hands covering her quivering lips, she stared at the sitting woman. 
Although she had dreamt of such a response she did not imagine the teacher 
would actually say it in return. The woman stood up and made her way 
to the student, wrapping her arms around her. Mugi sank into her, she 
wanted the feeling of Sawako&#39;s arms around her to last forever. She 
was in a state of bliss, completely content at that moment with Sawako&#39;s 
warmth, softness and scent surrounding her.</i></font> <br> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"><i>She didn&#39;t want to look a gift 
horse in the mouth but she was curious about the relieved expression 
she spotted on Sawako&#39;s face moments ago. &quot;Sawako sensei...&quot; 
Mugi felt Sawako&#39;s answering &#39;hmm&#39; vibrate from the woman&#39;s chest rather 
than heard it. &quot;You seemed relieved when you responded. May I ask 
why?&quot; Sawako chuckled at Mugi&#39;s polite but insistent question. 
She was more than happy to explain. Sawako had fallen for the earnest 
young woman who displayed an aptitude for any endeavor she attempted. 
She fought a fierce battle within herself once she realized her feelings 
for Mugi. After all, they were student and teacher, older and younger. 
Any move towards the younger woman would have been incredibly inappropriate. 
Despite the fact that she loved stripping Mio and dressing her in cosplay 
or suggestive clothing, there were certain lines she couldn&#39;t cross. 
And so she took her somewhat sadistic inclinations out on the girl would 
would react in the most outrageous manner when in fact it was Mugi who 
was on her mind. The young woman deserved better and ironically, also 
intimidated Sawako, who decided she&#39;d keep that last part to herself. </i></font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"><i>She explained all of it to 
Mugi, happy that she didn&#39;t have to hide her feelings from the girl 
she loved. Mugi snuggled deeper into Sawako&#39;s arms ecstatic that she 
was finally able to confess her feelings to the woman she admired and 
loved so much. It was an even bigger shock to find that Sawako returned 
her affections. She did not feel so alone anymore. Mugi loved her friends 
dearly but it also seemed they were &#39;paired up&#39;. Whether it was true 
or not there had been a lingering air of isolation. Mio and Ritsu seemed 
like they belonged together while Yui was always glued to Azusa. Being 
at home did not help since her parents were constantly traveling.</i></font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Suddenly, it hit her that Sawako&#39;s 
body was flush against hers and her body temperature rose immediately. 
She noticed the older woman had stiffened as well and they drew back 
while looking at each other. The teacher spoke softly, &quot;Mugi, I 
will make a promise to you. I want us to be together, but we can&#39;t right 
now. You are still a student.&quot; Mugi was disappointed but she was 
also a smart girl. She knew of the consequences of entering a relationship 
with Sawako right away. She knew what the teacher meant and quickly 
agreed.</i></font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS"><i>I 
will wait until graduation. It&#39;s a year but at least I will still be 
able to see you in school.&quot; Sawako hugged Mugi upon the girl&#39;s 
words. She kissed her on the forehead. &quot;Then I promise I will wait 
for you as well, Mugi.&quot;</i></font> <br> <br> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi&#39;s fingers touched the spot 
on her forehead where Sawako kissed her a year ago. She remembered the 
feeling of the soft lips and wondered how they would feel against her 
own. It wasn&#39;t the first time she had that thought.  Her eyes glazed 
over and her face flushed as she forgot she was still in the clubroom 
with the others. She was so absorbed in her thoughts she even missed 
when Ritsu&#39;s arm ended up around Mio. And she lived for those moments. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Thinking 
of something yummy, Mugi-chan?&quot; The words, said in a whispered, 
teasing manner, came from her right, Sawako&#39;s usual seat during teatime. 
Somehow the teacher always made it into the room and sat at the table 
without the others noticing. The only person who did notice every time 
was Mugi, of course, her reason for doing so rather obvious.  She 
blinked, a warm smile quickly coming to her lips as Sawako winked at 
her.  The others still caught up in their conversations missed 
the exchange between the two.</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> &quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Would 
you care for a slice of cake, sensei?&quot; Mugi asked as she brought 
the piece she had procured especially for the older woman.</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">I&#39;d 
love a piece, thank you.&quot; Sawako answered as she sipped her tea 
that Mugi poured.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Mugi-chan!&quot; 
Mugi looked up as Yui called out to her, &quot;Want to come over to 
my house for snacks? Ui is making lots today!&quot;</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> &quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">I&#39;d 
love to, Yui! But I can&#39;t today, my apologies. I am having dinner tonight 
with my parents since they will be out of the country tomorrow and can&#39;t 
be here for the graduation ceremony. Please feel free to go ahead without 
me this time.&quot;</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> &quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Awww.&quot; 
Yui pouted but accepted Mugi&#39;s polite apology. The girls all pitched 
in to clean up after themselves. They all had a feeling there was something 
going on between their friend and Sawako-sensei but instead of accosting 
her with the knowledge they decided they&#39;d wait until Mugi filled them 
in.</font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">They filed out, the door closing 
behind them cutting off the chatter of the four girls. The golden light 
of the setting sun bounced off Sawako&#39;s hair and created a halo-like 
effect around her head. Mugi&#39;s hands itched to run through the burnished 
locks. She was caught off guard and sighed happily when Sawako reached 
over and stroked the blonde hair at the side of Mugi&#39;s face.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">What 
were you thinking of earlier?&quot; She asked the younger woman, her 
fingers abandoning the light hair and traced imaginary lines on the 
side of Mugi&#39;s face instead. Heart skipping a beat, Mugi replied breathlessly, 
&quot;Your lips.&quot; Sawako&#39;s touching was having a dangerous effect 
on her. For the past year they had been very patient with each other. 
They still spent quiet afternoons in the clubroom together, with rules 
in place which included no touching and a certain distance between them 
when alone. They were safe as long as they were around the others. To 
touch each other while alone would be asking for trouble. They both 
knew this yet Sawako did not stop and Mugi did not object. Her blue 
eyes drifted close as her she put her hand on top of Sawako&#39;s.</font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Tsumugi...&quot; 
She felt a shift in the air before the faintest of touch on her lips. 
Heartbeat tripling, all thoughts left her head. Her entire body felt 
hot and she wanted more. And she wanted it now. Sawako was drawing back 
across the table when Mugi grabbed her shoulders and whispered one word.</font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">No.&quot;  
She pulled the teacher towards her and kissed her fully on the lips. 
Sawako&#39;s hand slipped to the back of Mugi&#39;s head and pulled her closer. 
All of the times she imagined kissing Sawako faded. Now that the woman&#39;s 
lips were upon hers she trembled at the perfect feeling, she never thought 
it would feel so marvelous. She gasped and Sawako immediately deepened 
the kiss, her tongue flicking against Mugi&#39;s lips before darting into 
her mouth.</font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi moaned in a most un-ladylike 
manner which evoked an answering moan from Sawako. They were both so 
caught up in each other they did not hear running footsteps on the stairs, 
or the door opening until Yui ran in calling out &quot;Git-...&quot;</font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">They pulled apart quickly, their 
faces red as they looked towards the door to find Yui and Azusa gaping 
at them. Azusa was the first to catch herself. She bowed and stuttered 
&quot;G-gomenasai!!!&quot;, grabbed Gitah in one hand, a shell-shocked 
Yui in another and ushered her out the door before closing it.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi and Sawako were once again 
by themselves. They looked at each other blankly for a few seconds before 
laughter bubbled up and out. Sawako held her stomach as she laughed.  
Mugi giggled, hands covering her mouth.</font> <br> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> &quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Well, 
that&#39;s one way of telling your friends!&quot; Sawako commented, remembering 
the expression on the other girls faces which made her laugh even more.  
She gasped for air and finally their mirth died away.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Do 
you mind them finding out like that?&quot; The teacher asked a bit more 
seriously once they  settled down. &quot;Somewhat, but I don&#39;t 
regret the kiss.&quot; She blushingly admitted. Sawako laughed and placed 
a finger on Mugi&#39;s lips.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">You&#39;re 
rather bold, Kotobuki-san.&quot; At those words, Mugi smiled mischievously,  
parted her lips and bit the tip of Sawako&#39;s finger.</font> <br>
 <br> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">That night Mugi called Azusa and 
Yui to ask if they had told anyone what they witnessed in the clubroom. 
Azusa stuttered, said no and switched the topic to the impending celebratory 
dinner. Mugi was pleased at the younger girl&#39;s tact and graciously allowed 
her to switch the conversation. She then called Yui and after some small 
talk posed the same question. Yui answered in the negative, stating 
that Azu-nyan promised she wouldn&#39;t hug her anymore if she said anything 
about kissing to the others. Mugi giggled but her face became hot immediately 
after Yui asked what it felt like to kiss Sawa-chan like that? </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi didn&#39;t have a proper answer. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">The day of graduation came and 
went in a blur. The girls felt rather emotional now that they were leaving 
their beloved Sakura High School behind. It finally hit Yui they were 
leaving for good in the middle of the ceremony. She burst out in tears 
but they were all somewhat teary eyed. They could not rebuke Yui in 
all fairness considering they sat in the same boat. Outside cherry blossoms 
slowly floated down to the ground as various kouhais took photographs 
and made their last memories with their sempais. </font></p>
