<h1>Pale Gold Amidst Autumn (part 5 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kon/index.html">K-ON!</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/museless.html">Museless</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kon/palegold-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a>  <p align="center"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"><u>Chapter 5: Anniversary</u></font> 
<br>
 <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi hurried out of the building, 
her excitement palpable. Tonight had to be special, everything had to 
be perfect. The blonde woman raised a fist, and steeled herself in order 
to assure victory for this particular battle. Not that Mugi had to worry 
about extending much effort, she was smart and picked projects up easily 
and with such elegance her friends would have envied her (if they didn&#39;t 
love her so much). In fact it was hard to hate Tsumugi for any reason. 
She thought of the meal she wanted to create tonight as she briskly 
walked to her car. Caught up in her thoughts, she did not notice two 
of her closest friends trying to catch her attention from across the 
street.</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Oi, 
Mugi!” Ritsu called loudly, waving her arms in the air. Mio stood 
next to her, embarrassment  evident on her face. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Stop 
it, Ritsu!” She elbowed her companion in the ribs in order to quiet 
her. After all this time, Mio still did not like attention. She pulled 
the other woman across the street when the light changed. </font> <br>
 <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Oh 
my!” Mugi exclaimed happily, as she saw her friends. “I didn&#39;t think 
I&#39;d run into you two here!” She hugged her friends. “Today is that 
day for you as well, isn&#39;t it?” The blonde asked cheerfully. The two 
nodded, Mio a faint blush on her cheeks, while Ritsu grinned widely. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">The woman with the amber eyes 
took Mio&#39;s hand in her own and said, “Mio said we should play hooky 
today and go on an all day date.” </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mio looked on in horror before 
she turned to Mugi, a pleading look in her eyes, “N-no! That was her 
idea!” She then turned and cuffed Ritsu on the head. “Don&#39;t lie 
to her, you idiot!” </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Ritsu grinned sheepishly as she 
rubbed her head. “Sorry, my idea.” </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi chuckled at the interaction 
between the two. <i>&#39;Some things never change&#39;</i>, she thought as she 
spoke up. “Well, well.  It&#39;s nice to have a day off sometimes. 
Besides, it&#39;s a special day today.”  She beamed at her friends. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mio smiled at her gratefully, 
“It&#39;s all thanks to you, Mugi.” Mugi waved away her words, a tad 
embarrassed. </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Ritsu placed a hand on the blonde&#39;s 
shoulder and in an uncharacteristically serious manner she added, “It&#39;s 
true. I&#39;m happier than I&#39;ve ever been. I love my friend Mio. And because 
of your words I&#39;m able to love her in ways I could only dream of for 
years. So, thank you.” The enthusiastic drummer gave Mugi a hug, then 
nudged her. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">So 
where are you off to in such a hurry? Got big plans for Sawa-chan, eh?” 
She grinned, the usual cheery expression returning to her face as she 
teased Mugi. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi nodded, “Yes, I&#39;m going 
to make dinner and I have a present for her.” She showed them the 
item, their mouths issuing a &#39;Whoa!&#39; in unison. Mio marveled, “I think 
she will love it Mugi-chan!” On Ritsu&#39;s face was a thoughtful look, 
Mugi didn&#39;t fail to notice although the raven haired woman was oblivious. 
She thought happily to herself, &#39;<i>Oh the things I set in motion!&#39;</i></font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">She did not get offended when 
they decided to get going, pleased instead they were spending time together. 
She could not help but turn and stare at them in a dreamy manner. They 
walked away, speaking to each other as if no one else in the world existed. 
Mugi sighed and thought to herself, <i>&#39;Life is good&#39;.</i></font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Still within shouting distance, 
Ritsu turned around and waved to Mugi, “Let&#39;s all get together this 
weekend, okay?” Mugi waved in acknowledgment before getting into her 
car. </font> <br> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">-x-x-x-</font> <br> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">For Mugi, no country was more 
romantic than Italy so it made sense that she would make an Italian 
meal. She prepared a salad, bruschetta, passatelli in brodo and golden 
fettucine before taking a quick shower. Setting two places at the dining 
table, she put the finishing touches on the torta claudia.  Removing 
the apron, she adjusted the black dress she wore. It was a simple piece 
of clothing, the knee-length skirt fluttering around her thighs while 
the upper part clung to her waist and bust. The platinum necklace she 
wore around her neck hinted at the subtle creamy cleavage on display. 
She felt ready for anything.</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">As if by clockwork the front door 
opened and Sawako walked in. “I&#39;m home.” She called out the customary 
greeting while taking off her shoes. Mugi stepped into the entryway 
and Sawako&#39;s eyes widened as a appreciative smile came to her face. 
“Wow”, she breathed. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Welcome 
home.” The younger woman greeted softly. With a  wicked smile 
only Sawako was acquainted with, she asked, “Would you like dinner, 
a bath...or me?” The teacher&#39;s eyes  glinted behind her glasses 
as she answered. </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Do 
you even have to ask?” She pulled Mugi into her arms and kissed her 
in a manner that set the young woman&#39;s heart thumping. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi pulled away, grabbing Sawako&#39;s 
hand in one of her own. “Too bad. We&#39;ll have dinner first.”</font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Sawako growled as she muttered, 
“Damn tease!”</font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi laughed as the woman&#39;s words 
as she led the her into the dining room. Sawako was silent the moment 
they entered the room. Her eyes took in her girlfriend&#39;s efforts and 
became misty. The atmosphere in the space was intimate, before Sawako 
had arrived Mugi lit candles placed strategically around the room and 
turned off the lights. A romantic piano piece Mugi might or might not 
have performed in the past played in the background. The teacher swept 
Mugi into another hug. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Sensei...”, 
she gasped, “I can&#39;t...breathe...” Sawako loosened the hug but did 
not let Mugi go. She did not know what she had done to inspire such 
love in the younger woman but she wasn&#39;t going to question it. The only 
thing she could do that made the most sense was to return the younger 
woman&#39;s love and affection twice as much. She rubbed her lips against 
Mugi&#39;s, smiling. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Let&#39;s 
eat!”</font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi 
nodded happily and turned to the kitchen in order to retrieve the dishes. 
“You stay here!” She warned Sawako, who took a seat. Mugi was surprisingly 
strict sometimes, especially about the smallest things. Despite her 
upbringing she did not act like someone who needed to be constantly 
served, instead she developed a habit of serving others, taking pleasure 
in their happiness and comfort. Sawako supposed that was one reasons 
she loved the younger woman so much. </font> <br> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">As Mugi brought out the dishes 
Sawako&#39;s jaw dropped. All of the dishes Mugi had prepared reminded her 
of the vacation they had taken to Italy together the year before. They 
had sampled all of those and more during those sun filled days in a 
distant city filled with narrow streets and hospitable natives. After 
returning home she mentioned to the younger woman how much she missed 
the food there. Mugi had simply smiled and said, “We can always go 
back.” But the teacher didn&#39;t exactly have the time off for further 
travel and neither did Mugi who was preparing to take over Kotobuki 
Industries at her father&#39;s persistence. </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">The last thing Mugi brought to 
the table was a bottle of fine white wine. She poured them each a glass 
before they began eating.  Sawako praised Mugi&#39;s culinary prowess 
as she tasted each dish. They spoke of their day, Sawako&#39;s prepping 
for a new influx of students, club activities, Mugi&#39;s meeting with her 
father and running into their friends, each offering a comment here 
and there but listening to the other attentively. Mugi remarked how 
her father had practically chased her out of the offices when he realized 
what day it was. </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">She laughed as she pondered how 
much of a closet romantic he could be at times and shared the thought 
with Sawako. Looking back there was a time when she thought none of 
this could happen. This, meaning years together with the woman she loved 
by her side. She had taken a huge gamble after spending the night for 
the first time at the older woman&#39;s apartment. Leaving for home the 
next morning she went straight to her parents, nerves readied as she 
informed them of her love for another woman.</font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Her parents weren&#39;t particularly 
thrilled at the idea in the beginning, her father especially opposed 
since it meant he would not receive a son-in-law or grandchild to pass 
the company onto. But while they were away a lot on business when Mugi 
was growing up it did not mean they were bad parents. They came around, 
loathe to restrict their daughter, especially from something that caused 
her happiness. She was their only child after all and they did not want 
to live their lives apart from hers. </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi proposed a toast and their 
glasses clinked as they wished each other a happy anniversary. </font> <br>
 <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">To 
five years together.” Sawako declared. </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">To 
many, many more.” Mugi added with a smile. The teacher nodded in agreement. 
The wine was excellent and so they sat together on the couch and drank 
almost all of it after cleaning up. They cuddled speaking about any 
little topic that came to their minds. After a while their sentences 
slowed down. Mugi promptly fell asleep in the arms of the teacher and 
Sawako smirked. She lightly traced her finger across Mugi&#39;s lips and 
nose just to tease a reaction from the sleeping young woman but soon 
enough she yawned as well.  </font> <br> <br> <br>
</p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">-x-x-x-</font> <br>

 <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi awoke to a darkened apartment, 
a pain in her neck and Sawako muttering in her sleep. <i>&#39;...thas good 
tea...buh where&#39;s the cake?&#39; </i>The blonde giggled, years later the 
teacher was still a constant source of amusement. Gingerly, she moved 
until she settled into the woman&#39;s lap, straddling her. <i>&#39;No tea or 
cake&#39;</i>, she thought to herself, &#39;<i>but I&#39;m sure Sawako won&#39;t 
mind.&#39;</i></font> <br>
 <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">She placed a kiss on the sleeping 
woman&#39;s neck, then her lips. Seeing no reaction from her girlfriend 
she gently bit an ear before kissing her once more on the lips. She 
nibbled on Sawako&#39;s lower lip before lazily slipping her tongue into 
the woman&#39;s mouth. Sawako&#39;s eyes finally drifted open. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi grinned in a satisfied manner. 
“Good morning.” She whispered, her lips inches away from Sawako&#39;s. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Mmm...What 
time is it?” The teacher asked. </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">I&#39;d 
say around 1or 2 am.” </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Going 
to bed?” </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">I&#39;m 
thinking of taking a nice hot bath before I do.” Mugi answered as 
she pressed her body against the other woman. Sawako&#39;s lids lowered.</font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">I 
think I might join you.” She told the blonde.</font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Are 
you sure?” Mugi asked, in a mock skeptical manner as she pulled away 
in order to stand up. After years with Sawako she knew how to play a 
game or two. She did learn from the master after all. And Mugi, still 
very much an avid student.  </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">“Yes, I was just dreaming about 
you.” Sawako grinned at her sleepily.</font> <br> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Liar.” 
Mugi smirked, “I heard you, you spoke in your sleep. You were dreaming 
about cake.” She turned to walk away and Sawako wrapped her arms around 
her from behind. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Did 
I mention you look wonderful in that dress, Mugi-chan?” She placed 
a kiss on her girlfriend&#39;s shoulder hoping to distract her. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Don&#39;t 
change the subject, Sensei.” She shivered as Sawako lay more kisses 
on her neck, gradually making her way up to Mugi&#39;s jaw. The younger 
woman turned around and kissed her hard, leaving her breathless. If 
anyone had told her years ago that it would be Mugi making her feel 
this way right now she would have laughed them out the building. But 
it was Mugi who coaxed a slow flame into a raging inferno deep inside. 
The blonde pushed the woman back onto the couch and straddled her once 
more.</font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Mugi...” 
Sawako gasped as she felt the younger woman&#39;s heat on her legs. She 
had to touch her, delve into her hotness. Kissing Mugi&#39;s neck again, 
she suckled on the skin as her hands raced over her body finally arriving 
at the blonde&#39;s breasts. She massaged them, making Mugi cry out before 
they kissed, tongues battling. Pulling the blonde&#39;s dress down past 
her bosom, she bared perfect mounds that ached to be touched and kissed. 
Complying to the unspoken wishes she lovingly licked one then the other. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi&#39;s eyes were closed, head 
flung back as she enjoyed Sawako&#39;s ministrations. She did not care if 
she appeared wanton, she only cared that the woman she loved, loved 
her the same way. Her breath quickened as she felt Sawako&#39;s hands on 
her legs, slipping under the dress to caress her thighs. The muscles 
under the skin of that area tensed, waiting for Sawako&#39;s hands to explore 
further. She urged the woman to touch her<i>, </i>

to touch her <i>there, </i>moving her hips forward.</font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">After what felt like a lifetime 
she felt Sawako&#39;s fingers lightly touch her, rubbing against her teasingly. </font> 
<br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Please...” 
She moaned to the woman, who finally acquiesce by slipping her fingers 
within Mugi&#39;s wet warmth. She rode Sawako&#39;s digits, head thrown back, 
breathless, quickly coming as she passionately kissed the woman, their 
tongues echoing the dance of the fingers deep within her. </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Eventually regaining their breath, 
they made their way to the bath, stripping along the way. Mugi reciprocated 
the teacher&#39;s actions from earlier until the hot water turned cold, 
prompting them to retire to the most comfortable spot in their home, 
the bed. Drifting off to sleep a thought floated by in Mugi&#39;s mind. 
She jolted upright and dashed from the room. Bewildered at first, Sawako 
chuckled at the sight of Mugi&#39;s bare bottom and flying blonde hair.  </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">She returned with a small item 
in her hand, a sheepish look on her face. </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Ah, 
I forgot to give you your gift earlier.” At the word gift Sawako stiffened.</font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Wait 
right here!” She told the younger woman, disappearing for a moment. 
Reappearing, with a small box as well she sat on the bed and they faced 
each other. Glancing at the gift in each others hand they had the same 
thought. <i>&#39;It couldn&#39;t be!&#39;</i></font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">They handed over their gifts, 
wishing each other happy anniversary again. </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Opening the boxes they each found 
a simple but beautiful platinum ring-of the same design.</font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Will 
you-” began Mugi.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Marry 
me.”Sawako said. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">They gaped at each other then 
burst out in laughter. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Oh 
my goodness.” Mugi giggled, her hand in front of her mouth.</font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">This 
is a gas!” Hooted Sawako, tears in her eyes. </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">They settled back into bed, arms 
around each other. Occasionally one would chuckle and set the other 
off. It was almost daybreak when they joined the sleeping masses, adorned 
in nothing but the rings on their fingers. </font> <br> <br>
