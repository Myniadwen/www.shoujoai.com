fanfiction by <a href="../authors/museless.html">Museless</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kon/palegold-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a>  <p align="center"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"><u>Chapter 4: No 
Regrets</u></font> <br> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Sawako grinned as she put the 
groceries away. She glanced at her watch, pleased it was still early. 
She surveyed her apartment, and everything seemed to be in place. It 
was Friday. Almost a week had passed since the day at the beach with 
Mugi. Thanks to younger woman&#39;s busy schedule with her parents and Sawako 
being occupied with work,  they did not have much chance to see 
each other. Tonight would be different though. While messaging each 
other one night, Sawako impetuously extended an invitation to dinner 
at her place. Mugi&#39;s response, an instantaneous &#39;I would love to!&#39; </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">She looked at the clock again 
to make sure she had enough time to prepare dinner before she began 
cooking. It was some time later when she wiped her brow, a small smirk 
of satisfaction on her face. Her miniscule kitchen was ridiculously 
hot and she decided to open a few other windows to alleviate the heat 
of the apartment. As she walked back into the  small space the 
oven dinged and she happily exclaimed “Right on time!” There were 
only a few little finishing touches left. Another quick glimpse of her 
watch showed she had half hour to get dressed and so she dashed into 
the bathroom.</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Donning a pair of jeans, a white 
camisole and a favorite beige sweater, she hunted for a pair of earrings 
to complete the outfit. She happened to spot a pair of jade ones an 
ex had given her when she suddenly remembered she had forgotten one 
thing. “Shit!” She cursed out loud the same moment her phone rang. 
She picked up to hear Mugi chirp, “Hi Sawako-sensei! I&#39;m on the train, 
and will be arriving soon.” </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, 
Mugi! I forgot something necessary, so I have to go out. I&#39;ll meet you 
at the station instead.” Sawako improvised. She did not want the young 
woman to appear at the apartment only to wait for her hostess.    </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Excellent. 
I&#39;ll see you soon, sensei!” Sawako could practically feel the warmth 
Mugi&#39;s voice radiated as they ended the call. She felt a small tremor 
as she thought of Mugi&#39;s lips. &#39;I will not push. I will not push.&#39; The 
teacher repeated the mantra under her breath as she locked her door 
behind her and headed for the station. She lived surprisingly close 
to it and the train would have been a godsend traveling to Sakura High 
School if she did not have a car.  Several cherry blossoms fell 
on her head and as she walked, she absently brushed aside the petals. 
She let her mind wander and ended up free associating on several different 
topics, blossoms, graduation, Mugi, Mugi calling her &#39;sensei&#39;. She wondered 
if Mugi would easily agree to drop the sensei following her name since 
they no longer had a student-teacher relationship. </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">The girl in question gently called 
out to Sawako as the teacher was still deep in thought. She looked up, 
a smile quickly coming to her lips. She would have liked to greet Mugi 
with a kiss but settled instead for a quick squeeze of her hand since 
they were in public with many people milling about. They walked towards 
a neighborhood shop, exchanging small talk, thrilled to be in the others 
presence. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Yo, 
Sawa-chan!”, shouted a pleasant male voice. Sawako cursed under her 
breath as the stranger approached and she recognized him. Mugi noted 
the teacher did not look happy to see him. </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Hello 
Kouji.” Her voice held the barest hint of civility. </font> <br>
 <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, 
Sawa-chan, is that any way to greet an old flame?” His face held a 
wide grin the teacher wanted to slap right off his face. Mugi uttered 
a surprised gasp but the other two didn&#39;t notice. She looked at the 
man, he had a lean face with shaggy brown hair tumbling over his forehead, 
almost covering his dark eyes.  Stubble adorned his face and she 
supposed many women might find him good looking, including the teacher. 
She suddenly felt a twinge of jealousy, knowing the man in front of 
her had probably touched her Sawako in ways  she had only dreamt 
of.</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Turning towards Mugi, he asked 
while appraising her, “Who&#39;s this blondie? She&#39;s cute! She single?” 
Mugi suddenly felt revolted but manners dictated giving her name even 
in situations like this. She was about to answer when Sawako spoke for 
her. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">I 
don&#39;t see how that&#39;s any of your business. Why are you here?” In the 
past, Mugi heard many tones in the older woman&#39;s voice but never had 
she heard such coldness. </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Aww 
c&#39;mon. Don&#39;t be like that now.” Kouji replied with charm. Except it 
didn&#39;t work this time. Sawako glared at him. Mugi suddenly spotted the 
guitar case on Kouji&#39;s back and thought of a way to diffuse the situation. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Ah, 
Kouji-san, are you a musician perhaps?” </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">He straightened himself and grinned 
at Mugi. “Yeah, I am! Me and Sawa-chan go way back. Started in a band. 
I&#39;m pretty good but her-,” He nodded towards Sawako for effect, “she&#39;s 
got some wicked guitar skills.” </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Sawako did not acknowledge his 
praise, instead her lips were a slash of displeasure. Kouji&#39;s grin switched 
to a leer. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Of 
course, she&#39;s got some wicked skills in be-” He didn&#39;t get to finish 
the sentence as Sawako hauled off and slugged him in the jaw. Mugi stared, 
flabbergasted while Sawako cradled the hand she hit Kouji with. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Shut 
up, asshole!” She snarled, “You don&#39;t get to talk about my &#39;skills&#39;. 
You sure as hell did nothing to deserve them!” She grabbed Mugi&#39;s 
hand and started to walk away. Then she turned back to Kouji and grinned, 
lifting her and Mugi&#39;s hand together triumphantly.</font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">By 
the way, she&#39;s with me.” </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">His eyes were the size of saucers 
as he stared at their retreating back. “Son of a bitch!” He muttered.</font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">As they walked away,Mugi had an 
expression of something akin to &#39;my hero&#39; on her face as she stared 
at Sawako&#39;s profile, stars in her eyes.  </font> <br> <br>

</p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">-x-x-x-</font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mio stood in front the door at 
the Tainaka&#39;s residence, her hand shaking as she lifted it to press 
the doorbell. Mugi&#39;s parting words to her on Sunday had haunted the 
raven haired young woman, sending her on a rollercoaster of emotions 
during the past couple of days. After thinking about it,  Mio finally 
worked up the nerve on Tuesday to speak with Ritsu. She knew if she 
arranged to spend time with Ritsu beforehand she&#39;d never get around 
to discussing the issue plaguing her. Stepping out the door, she almost 
made it halfway to the drummer&#39;s house. The idea of what she was about 
do loomed at the forefront of her mind, and fear took over. She promptly 
turned around, all courage lost, doubt and despair taking its place 
as she walked back home. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">She repeated the process several 
times during the week. </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">As she stood staring at the door, 
her finger an inch away from the doorbell, she faltered once more. Flooded 
with panic, she stepped backwards. Her back hit the gate and as she 
turned to escape the front door opened. Ritsu&#39;s mother and younger brother 
Satoshi stepped out. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mio!” 
Mrs. Tainaka exclaimed as she caught sight of the girl, “Ritsu didn&#39;t 
tell us you were coming over. I swear, that girl forgets everything!” 
Mrs. Tainaka said exasperatedly. “Hello, Mio-san!” Satoshi added 
with a grin that was very much like his older sister&#39;s. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Er...G-good 
evening, Tainaka-san, Satoshi-kun. ” Mio stuttered, “Um, she doesn&#39;t 
know. I thought I&#39;d just drop by since I was out for a walk.”  </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Oh! 
Well then, please go ahead, Ritsu is in her room. There&#39;s food in the 
kitchen, covered  in case you girls get hungry. We&#39;ll be out for 
a while.” </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Don&#39;t 
let Ritsu eat all the food!” Satoshi added. Mio smiled at him then 
turned to Mrs. Tainaka. “Thank you, Tainaka-san. Please enjoy your 
evening.” </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">They left, with Mio standing in 
the entryway. As the door closed behind her she felt rooted to the spot. 
Suddenly she noticed loud music coming from the direction of Ritsu&#39;s 
room. She decided at that moment she had two options. She could leave 
and stay friends with Ritsu forever. Or she could take Mugi&#39;s advice 
and take the few footsteps to the energetic girl&#39;s room.  Her heart 
ached as she imagined a repulsed expression on Ritsu&#39;s face. </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">A loud yell of “I&#39;m free!” 
pierced Mio&#39;s thoughts and she became curious about what the other girl 
was doing. She stepped out of her shoes and into the hallway. The music 
was so loud it masked her footsteps. The bedroom door was ajar, the 
drummer&#39;s back to it. Mio became entranced by the sight of Ritsu, who 
pretended to beat on the drums in time with the music. The girl was 
singing along to the song, which by then Mio recognized as The Who&#39;s 
I&#39;m Free. She hopped up and down, her short hair bouncing at the enthusiastic 
movement, her hips swinging from one side to the next. Mio&#39;s face flushed 
at the movement as she thought <i>&#39;I didn&#39;t know she could move like 
that.&#39; </i>She giggled, titillated and amused all at once at the drummer&#39;s 
actions.  </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">I&#39;m 
free! ...I&#39;m waiting for you to follow me...”</font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Ritsu spun around and caught Mio 
mid-giggle. She elicited a shocked &#39;Ahh!&#39;, taking a step  back. 
Unaware a table was right behind her, she toppled backwards, crashing 
onto the floor.  Mio rushed into the room, panic for her friend 
taking over. She knew the accident was her fault, if only she hadn&#39;t 
snuck up on Ritsu... </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Ritsu rubbed her head, groaning 
in pain. Mio came to her aid, helping her up. They sat on the edge of 
the bed, Mio fussing over the other girl. Ritsu shook her head and pointed 
to the cd player. Mio understood immediately and turned the music off. </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Geez, 
Mio”. The brown haired girl said as she continued rubbing the sore 
spot on her head. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">I&#39;m 
sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to surprise you-” Mio babbled, anxiety apparent 
on her face. She had forgotten for a moment why she was visiting. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"> Ritsu didn&#39;t hear Mio&#39;s apology, 
instead words falling freely from her lips, “God! What are  you now? 
Some kind of peeping tom sneaking into people&#39;s houses?!!” Mio felt 
embarrassed, but another feeling quickly took over. </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Ritsu&#39;s head sported a lump and 
was now hurting twice as much. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">-x-x-x-</font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">They entered the apartment, Sawako 
holding the door open to let Mugi in before she trudged in. They had 
not spoken a word to each other after their encounter with Kouji. Sawako 
hissed, her hand throbbing in pain. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Motherf-” 
She did not finish the expletive as her eyes fell on Mugi, finishing 
lamely instead with, “...Oh my god, that hurts!” Mugi giggled before 
she took Sawako&#39;s hand in her own hands, cradling it gently. </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Sawako-sensei...”</font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Mugi-chan...” </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">They both spoke at the same time, 
stopped and waited for the other to continue. As the silence stretched, 
Mugi politely suggested, “Why don&#39;t you go first, Sensei?” </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Sawako scratched the back of her 
neck with her unhurt hand, her eyes averted. She finally looked at the 
expectant girl. “I&#39;m really sorry you had to witness that. Kouji is-was, 
a rather unfortunate mistake from my past. But in a way, I&#39;m not that 
sorry. Someone like him illustrates how lucky I am right now.” She 
caressed the side of Mugi&#39;s face, color blooming on the girl&#39;s cheek.  </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi chuckled, “Actually, I 
was about to tell you that I thought that was the coolest thing I have 
ever seen.” She looked at Sawako adoringly. Once in a while Mugi had 
the tendency to surprise the people around her. Now happened to be one 
of those times. Sawako didn&#39;t know what to say. </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">A thought hit her and she groaned. 
“Oh, crap! I need to serve dinner-” Mugi led her to the low table 
in the living room, taking over. “Sensei, why don&#39;t you sit and relax. 
I&#39;ll take care of everything.” </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">But-” 
Mugi&#39;s determined expression stopped Sawako short. “Alright, everything 
is in the kitchen already prepared. I just had to bring it all out.” 
She explained to the blonde who nodded happily and set off toward the 
kitchen. Mugi brought the covered dishes in but not before finding an 
ice pack for Sawako&#39;s hand. The teacher wondered where Mugi found it 
and if she even owned an ice pack. Finally the younger woman settled 
down, taking a seat next to Sawako. She uncovered the dishes and gasped 
in surprise. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Oh 
my!I had no idea you were such a good cook, Sawako-sensei! Everything 
smells delicious. ” The girl exclaimed, surprise evident on her face.  
Sawako didn&#39;t know whether she should be pleased or insulted at the 
younger woman&#39;s reaction. She looked at all the food laid out, onigiri(riceball), 
some sushi rolls, yakizakana(grilled fish), miso soup and gyoza(dumplings). 
She then smiled wryly as she remembered her friends reactions as well. 
They had been shocked the freewheeling Sawa-chan knew how to prepare 
traditional Japanese dishes and so well too. </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">She was about to pick up her chopsticks 
when Mugi leaned closer to her and asked, “Say &#39;ah&#39;, Sensei.” Automatically 
opening her mouth to accept the food, the teacher thought &#39;<i>Is she 
testing my reaction first before she begins eating?&#39; </i>

She chewed, then thought<i> “Nah, Mugi isn&#39;t like that.” </i></font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi on the other hand had just 
taken a bite while thinking,<i> &#39;Sawako-sensei&#39;s lips were on  
these chopsticks.&#39; </i>Flavor bloomed in her mouth taking her thoughts 
away from Sawako for a moment. “This really tastes wonderful, Sensei!” 
She gushed, “How did you learn to cook so well?”</font> <br>
 <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Sawako smiled, happy the young 
woman could enjoy her efforts. “Thanks, Mugi-chan.  I had a strict 
grandmother. She made sure I knew how to cook because she was concerned 
about me being a proper housewife.” Her brown eyes rolled at that 
prospect. “Imagine her consternation when I became the metal playing 
black sheep of the family.” Mugi nodded seriously. She knew exactly 
what it felt like to have things expected of her. Whether she liked 
it or not. Sawako noticed the younger woman&#39;s somber expression. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi, 
eat. We can talk about this stuff later, don&#39;t you agree?” </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Of 
course, Sensei.” Mugi replied, smiling warmly at the older woman as 
she elegantly brought the chopsticks to her lips. </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">-x-x-x-</font> <br>
 <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">“I don&#39;t know why you have to 
hit me every time, Mio-chan.” Ritsu pouted.  “Besides, you 
were the one sneaking around in my house. Pervert.” Mio glared but 
Ritsu once again ignored the warning signs. She wondered to herself 
for the millionth time why she loved an idiot like Ritsu. They were 
now sitting on the floor of the drummer&#39;s room. She sighed. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">I 
didn&#39;t sneak as you so nicely put it! Your mother let me in.” Mio 
explained.  Her ire  abated quickly, the girl&#39;s reactions 
always intense but never lengthy. Especially when it came to Ritsu. 
She just couldn&#39;t stay mad. </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">How&#39;s 
your head?” She asked.</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">It&#39;s 
not so bad now.” Ritsu answered, not particularly concerned. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">In a move that surprised herself 
and her friend, Mio&#39;s hand gently caressed the spot where Ritsu hit 
her head. The drummer stared at her in shocked silence as the hand brushed 
through the golden brown locks. Mio forgot herself at that moment, the 
tactile sensation of Ritsu&#39;s silky hair between her fingers taking over.   
Her breathing slowed as she allowed herself to touch Ritsu, who had 
taken off her customary yellow hair band to ease the pain. </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mio.” 
The name was spoken softly and woke her from the daze. Seeing just how 
close she was to Ritsu, she scooted backwards, shock plain on her face. 
“I-I...” She stuttered once again, licking her lips in an unconscious 
gesture. The action brought brought Ritsu&#39;s amber gaze zoning onto Mio&#39;s 
plump parted lips. Mio&#39;s anxiety hit the roof, she had no words to explain 
herself. She was panicking so much she didn&#39;t notice Ritsu didn&#39;t look 
upset at all. The girl squeaked as the drummer suddenly grabbed her 
and wrapped her arms around her. She tried pulling away at first but 
after a moment let herself melt into Ritsu&#39;s embrace. She closed her 
eyes, laying her head on the other girl&#39;s shoulder. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Ritsu felt Mio&#39;s body finally 
relaxing. “What&#39;s wrong, Mio?” She grew concerned when she heard 
and felt the sobs coming from Mio. In response she simply sat there, 
rocking with the young woman in her arms. She knew eventually Mio would 
tell her whatever was wrong. But she was also confused about Mio&#39;s sudden 
tenderness towards her a few moments ago.  <i>&#39;Nevermind that,&#39;</i> 

she thought to herself, <i>&#39;I just want to help Mio right now.&#39; </i>
Despite that,<i> s</i>he couldn&#39;t help thinking how soft Mio felt against 
her.</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mio drew a deep breath as her 
tears died away. She knew she&#39;d have to explain herself now. She owed 
that much to Ritsu. She tightened her grip around the drummer, thinking 
maybe this might be the last time she would get to hug her friend. The 
thought brought fresh tears to her eyes but through sheer will she refrained 
from giving in. It had gotten dark while the two girls sat on the floor, 
indicating quite some time had passed. Mugi&#39;s words came unbidden to 
her mind. “Yeah...no regrets.” She whispered.</font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Ritsu wondered what Mio&#39;s words 
meant and was about to ask when the grey eyed girl pulled back and looked 
her squarely in the face. Mio&#39;s direct gaze was so unlike her but there 
was something in the depths of her eyes that convinced the usually vivacious 
drummer to hold back.  Her face drew close to Ritsu&#39;s, her lips 
parted, her breathing slow. Tears welled at the corners of her eyes. 
The drummer froze in place, asking herself if Mio was doing what she 
thought she was doing.  Her amber eyes wide open as Mio&#39;s drifted 
closer, their lips touching for what seemed an eternity but only lasted 
a moment.</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mio?”, 
Ritsu whispered in a dazed manner. Mio, glanced at her, trepidation 
on her face. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mio,” 
Ritsu whispered again, unseeing, “Kiss me again.” &#39;<i>This can&#39;t</i> <i>

be happening</i>,&#39; The brown haired girl thought to herself as Mio closed 
in again, red on her cheeks vibrant.  She felt Mio&#39;s lips move 
against hers slowly, haltingly, before retreating once again. Warmth 
bloomed on her face, she grabbed the bassist&#39;s hands in her own, entwining 
their fingers together. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mio looked down at their hands, 
a fresh trail of tears on her face, her voice tremulous, “Ritsu, please 
don&#39;t hate me. Because...I love you, so much.”</font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mio?” 
Ritsu requested one more thing, her voice quiet, disbelief obvious, 
“Hit me, please.” </font> <br> <br> <br></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">-x-x-x-</font> <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi smiled blissfully, her stomach 
full with the wonderful meal Sawako prepared. After eating she insisted 
on cleaning up while the teacher applied the ice pack to her hand. Sawako 
protested she didn&#39;t need it but younger woman gave her another determined 
gaze. Stepping closer she bent over and pressed her lips to the teacher&#39;s 
effectively shutting her up. Sawako parted her lips and nipped Mugi&#39;s 
bottom lip. She could feel the smile of the younger woman against her 
mouth. She reached up and pulled her former student into her lap, their 
lips still connected. Their arms wound around each other, Mugi&#39;s around 
Sawako&#39;s shoulders, the older woman&#39;s around Mugi&#39;s waist. </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi pulled away, “Sensei, I 
have to clean up.”  But the smile on her face implied she really 
didn&#39;t mind kissing. In fact she&#39;d love to do it again. It was a game 
now, playfully finding ways to get closer to each other.  </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">The teacher grinned lazily, her 
glasses glinting. “Leave it.” Her brow furrowed as she thought of 
something. Mugi  wanted to use her fingers to smooth out the creases. 
&#39;<i>There&#39;s no one to stop me, why not?&#39;</i>, she thought to herself.  
She did just that, her fingers gently gliding over Sawako&#39;s brows. “Don&#39;t 
be so serious, Sawako-sensei.” Sawako smiled at the action but spoke 
what was on her mind. “Mugi-chan, could you just call me Sawako?”  
She gently reminded the girl, “There&#39;s no need to call me Sensei now.”</font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">I 
will try, but I can&#39;t make any promises. I&#39;ve been calling you Sensei 
for so long, it will be a hard habit to break.” Mugi admitted. “More 
importantly, we seemed to have gotten into a fix here.” She wiggled 
in the woman&#39;s lap as if to illustrate a point. Sawako planted a quick 
kiss on Mugi&#39;s forehead. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">There!” 
She exclaimed to the girl, “That should do it.” Mugi pouted, pretending 
to be disappointed.  Sawako placed a finger on her cheek as if 
thinking of solutions for a weighty problem. </font> <br> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Oh!” 
With a &#39;eureka!&#39; expression on her face she gave Mugi a peck on the 
lips. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">The girl shook her head gravely. 
“I&#39;m afraid that won&#39;t take care of the problem, Sensei.” </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Hmmm...”Sawako 
went back to &#39;thinking&#39;. </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Mugi squirmed, her proximity to 
Sawako doing dangerous things to her libido. A familiar ache flared 
up in her midsection as Sawako kissed one corner of her mouth, then 
another. She placed another kiss on the tip of Mugi&#39;s nose, one her 
chin and finally her lips.  Mugi pressed against her, impatience 
driving her. Gently biting the teacher&#39;s upper lip, she swiped her tongue 
across it before diving into the woman&#39;s open mouth. All she could feel 
and think about was Sawako, wanting to get closer. Her hands were buried 
in the teacher&#39;s hair, while Sawako&#39;s hands trailed up and down Mugi&#39;s 
back. They pulled apart, gasping for air.  Mugi leaned forward 
on Sawako, causing them both to fall back onto the floor.  </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Conveniently enough, they landed 
in a position where one of Sawako&#39;s thighs pressed against the juncture 
of Mugi&#39;s legs. Mugi gasped as she felt the pressure against her, while 
Sawako wore a smirk that set the young woman&#39;s heart beating at an incredibly 
fast pace. Looking down at the teacher, their bodies intimately tangled 
with each other, an intense heat built up in Mugi. She didn&#39;t smile, 
this time she dove straight for the woman&#39;s lips. Aroused as she was 
there was one thing she had to say, she needed to say it before they 
went any further. </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">She broke the kiss and rested 
her head on Sawako&#39;s shoulder, the pale gold strands of her hair joined 
the autumn colored tresses of the teacher. They stayed that way a moment, 
thinking the other could probably hear the sound of their racing hearts.</font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Sawako...”</font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Tsumugi...” </font> <br>
 <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">They spoke at the same time again, 
and laughed when they realized it. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">You 
first.” Sawako prompted this time. </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">I 
love you, Sawako-sensei.” Her azure eyes gazed into Sawako&#39;s as she 
murmered the words. The older woman&#39;s cheeks were pink, her lips curving 
into a loving smile. She brushed Mugi&#39;s hair away from her eyes gently. </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">I 
love you too, Mugi-chan.” She indicated the younger girl to get up 
and stood up as well. She then took Mugi by the hand and led her to 
the bedroom where she proceeded to show the girl exactly how much she 
cared.  </font> <br> <br> <br> <br>
