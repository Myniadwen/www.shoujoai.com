<p align="center"><strong>Exotic</strong></p>
 <br />
<p>            The next morning, Nami was lying on a beach,   soaked in ocean water. She opened her eyes slowly and became so relieved   that she was still alive.</p>
<p>            “O-oh my god, I’m still alive! Hey everyone,   aren’t you glad that we’re all…still…”</p>
<p>            Nami turned to look around and saw that no one   was with her. It was only her alone. She sighed and was questioning   what she should do. She had no idea where she was. There was no map   for her to look at and now she is lost.</p>
<p>            “I can’t believe it…not even a trace of   the Sunny anywhere…what could have happened to everyone?” Nami shivered   from the morning chill and sat up. What she also realized was that her   shirt was transparent from the water and that things are now able to   ‘see’ her. She gasped and covered herself with her arm. There was   a rustle in some bushes near her which startled her. She grew afraid   of what it might be, especially considering that Nami had no means of   protecting herself with her Clima-Tact. She reached for a stick that   was next to her and raised it at the bush. “G-get back! I’m warning   you!”</p>
<p>            “Hmm? Aren’t you far from the village?”</p>
<p>            “W-who…?” Nami asked, surprised she even   got a reply from what she thought was a predator of sorts. Instead,   it was a girl. She had short light-blondish hair which was kind of wavy.   Her clothing implied that she was some kind of tribesperson. Around   her neck she had a long exotic snake, something which also frightened   her.</p>
<p>            “Kyah! Th-there’s a snake around your neck!”</p>
<p>            “Oh, this? They’re quite abundant here. Are   you looking for one? Huh, oh hey!”</p>
<p>            The girl noticed that Nami had fainted and walked   over to her to see if she was alright. She held up Nami in her arms   to carry and looked at her.</p>
<p>            “Actually…she doesn’t look like anyone   from the village. Her clothes…where was this made? This marking…”   The girl noticed the tattoo painted on Nami’s shoulder. “Perhaps   she’s from another tribe. Strange, because this island is surrounded   by sea kings…well, best just to get her back to the village right   away.”</p>
<p>            Again, Nami woke up in a place she was unfamiliar   with. This time, she was in some kind of house, lying on some kind of   futon. “Where am I…? Where…where are my clothes!?”</p>
<p>            “Oh, you’re awake. I’m sorry, but you were   soaked when I found you. I brought a new set of clothes, if that’s   alright with you.”</p>
<p>            “Um, yes, thank you. So…where am I?”</p>
<p>            The girl sat down with Nami, who was sitting   up on the futon.</p>
<p>            “You’re on Amazon Lily. We’re a tribe of   only female warriors under the watchful eye of our Princess, Boa Hancock.   My name is Margaret, how about you?”</p>
<p>            “I’m Nami.”</p>
<p>            “That’s a nice name - short and simple.”   Margaret smiled, “O-oh, here you go. You might want to get changed.”</p>
<p>            Nami managed to laugh a little, “That’s right.   So…are you going to leave?”</p>
<p>            “You want me to? We’re all women here; I   don’t see why we can’t be in the same room. Besides, we’re indoors.   It’s fine. Even more so, I undressed you.” Margaret said it like   it really wasn’t that great a deal.</p>
<p>            “Well…I guess that’s true. A-alright then.”</p>
<p>            Nami began to put on the clothes she was given,   glancing every so often at Margaret. She wanted to make sure she wouldn’t   try anything funny. Margaret just watched and observed Nami’s bare   body.</p>
<p>            “You know…” Margaret spoke, “…you’re   pretty impressive.”</p>
<p>            “O-oh, um, thank you. They are pretty big aren’t   they?”</p>
<p>            Margaret looked at Nami’s chest and giggled   a little, “Did I make it sound like that? I’m sorry; I meant that   you’re pretty impressive to have drift to this island surrounded by   sea kings. But I believe you are impressive in that way too.”</p>
<p>            The two laughed, but Nami felt a little more   embarrassed than silly. She then felt something on her breasts. “Ah!   W-what’re you--?!”</p>
<p>            “Just curious. Hmm…yours are bigger than   mine. You’re pretty healthy.” Margaret smiled. Nami tried to smile   back, knowing the girl is just playing around. In a place where only   women exist, this could just be a normal thing.</p>
<p>            “O-oh w-wait…could you stop for a moment…?”</p>
<p>            “What is it, Nami?” Margaret asked as she   released her grip on Nami’s bust. The orange-haired girl turned to   look at Margaret.</p>
<p>            “Have you seen anyone else around here?”</p>
<p>            “Like whom?”</p>
<p>            “Well, there are six guys and one other woman   besides me.”</p>
<p>            Margaret looked puzzled after hearing ‘guys’,   “What is…’guys’?” </p>
<p>            Nami thought for a moment, “<em>That’s right…there   are only women on this island. They   probably never even heard of ‘guys’ before.</em>” She then ignored   that fact and just asked for Robin. “W-well, how about a woman that   has shoulder-length, raven-black hair, slightly darker skin than I do,   also slightly taller than I am? She was also in a dark uniform, have   you seen her?”</p>
<p>            Margaret tried to think even though she knows   she had never seen any such woman. “I-I’m not sure…but there are   women in this village who look similar to what you described. If you   want, we could go around town and ask.”</p>
<p>            “That seems like the best idea we have. Let’s   go…oh and thank you for helping me, Margaret.”</p>
<p>            “Absolutely. You can stay as long as you need   to until you’re able to find her. Until then, could you tell me what   a ‘guys’ is?”</p>
<p>            The two ventured out into the village where many   other women could be seen. Some were literal giants among others. With   such a vast mixture of women, it’ll be a little difficult to find   Robin. Nami and Margaret both spoke to many different women, but none   of which had seen Robin. Nami was beginning to feel a little disheartened   that might not be able to see Robin or her friends anymore. Margaret   was feeling a little guilty that she wasn’t being much help at the   moment. It was getting a little late in the evening and the two had   made it back to the house. Nami sat quietly on the balcony platform   as Margaret went to make tea.</p>
<p>            “Robin…guys…where are you?”</p>
<p>            Margaret overheard this as she was returning   to her guest and new friend with the tea she prepared. Setting it in   between herself and Nami, Margaret sat down her.</p>
<p>            “The tea is ready, Nami.”</p>
<p>            “…thanks.”</p>
<p>            There was silence between the two of them for   a little bit. Margaret broke the silence. “Your friend, Robin, sounds   really special. Is she perhaps…’that’ kind of friend?”</p>
<p>            “Yes…we just confessed to each other the   other night. Then a storm hit our ship hard with a wave…and that’s   how I ended up here. Until you found me, I thought I was going to die.”</p>
<p>            “That’s incredible…um…Nami…?”</p>
<p>            “What is it?”</p>
<p>            “Have you two…kissed?”</p>
<p>            Nami’s face became red as she heard Margaret’s   question. “Why do you want to know?” she said, sounding a little   defensive. Margaret just shook her head a little, knowing how Nami felt.</p>
<p>            “I’m sorry…I shouldn’t be asking those   kinds of things.”</p>
<p>            There was silence between the two again, only   this time was longer. The two sipped their tea until Nami spoke up.   “It felt nice…”</p>
<p>            “Hmm…?”</p>
<p>            “Have you ever been kissed before, Margaret?”</p>
<p>            Now Margaret was feeling her face blush, “I   have never been kissed before…why you ask?”</p>
<p>            Nami also shook her head, smiling a little. “It’s   just that you sounded curious before…and if you want to, I could…let   you know how it feels.”</p>
<p>            Margaret felt her face become warmer and possibly   redder. “B-but, what about Robin?”</p>
<p>            “I know…but as long as I will be able to   see her again, she will always be my first.” Nami smiled.</p>
<p>            “Your first…what do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>            “This…” Nami leaned over and pressed her   lips against Margaret’s. The Amazonian woman was caught by surprised,   but was glad to be getting her answer. It did felt nice to her lips.   She slowly closed her eyes and fully let herself be taken away by Nami’s   kisses. She wrestled with Nami’s tongue with her own and felt something   she never felt before. Margaret felt like she was about explode, just   by being kissed. Nami opened her eyes just a little, to look at Margaret   in her state of ecstasy. Nami wanted to do more things to her, but she   decided to stay true to her words and save them all for Robin. However,   she still wanted to mix it up, as thanks to Margaret for taking good   care of her. Nami broke her kiss and looked at Margaret, who was now   breathing quite heavily and her eyes were a little open. She was begging   for it, considering how her mouth was still open and her tongue was   reaching out for Nami’s flavor once more.</p>
<p>            The orange-haired girl smiled and slid her finger   into Margaret’s mouth. Like Nami had done to Robin’s, Margaret began   to suck up and down Nami’s finger and licked with her tongue. While   she was doing so, she began to moan rather loudly when she felt Nami’s   tongue trace her neck to just the top area of Margaret’s chest. Margaret   placed her arm around Nami’s waist and moved herself onto Nami’s   lap, wanting a lot more. Margaret tried to understand that Nami still   loves Robin and that she is only giving ‘thanks’ to her. The Amazonian   accepted and honored that well-enough to not try anything else than   what she is getting out of Nami. Margaret had to climax before Nami   and quickly. She did not want Nami to do so as well, despite her mind   telling her to be slow. What Margaret decided to do was what she hopes   would make herself climax right away.</p>
<p>            “Nami…wait…I don’t want you to do it   before I do…I can already tell just how special Robin, wherever she   may be, is to you.”</p>
<p>            “I understand, Margaret…maybe…when I find   her, I will introduce you to her…she is really a wonderful woman.   She’s very beautiful, too. T-then...if she agrees…the three of us   can…” As Nami spoke about the idea, her mind began to play the scenario,   which seemed to make her time shorter. Margaret could not let that happen.</p>
<p>            “A-ah! D-don’t stop now, Nami! T-take me   now!”</p>
<p>            “M-Margaret…but, I—“</p>
<p>            “Let’s just say it is a-a preview of what   it will be like with you and Robin! O-oh, k-kiss me, you beautiful--!”</p>
<p>            Margaret couldn’t contain herself as she forced   herself upon, Nami, which overwhelmed the other girl. This, however,   made Nami able to hold herself and keep Margaret going. The quickness   of it all kind of killed the mood for Nami, not to say she isn’t enjoying   it though, it was just too sudden. The warrior began rubbing most private   area against Nami’s shin. Nami just watched in amazement, unable to   think of what to do but watch.</p>
<p>            “N-Nami…you will…definitely be Robin’s   first…b-but…could you be m-mine, too?”</p>
<p>            Nami was even more surprised by this question,   but just could say no. Saying that would not be fair to Margaret, and   Nami knew what that was like, so she simply let Margaret go with a nod   and a smile. Eventually, Margaret climaxed through the cloth covering   her crotch, which she then nearly screamed and fell into Nami’s arms,   which had caught her. Nami just tried to take in what just happened   and looked at Margaret, who was now way too exhausted to speak and even   keep her eyes open. Nami felt the wetness on her leg, as well as the   little drops she had in her own crotch area.</p>
<p>            “Thank you, Margaret…you even went that far   to keep me from losing it myself…all so that Robin and I can share   our own moment together…” Nami began to run her fingers through   Margaret’s soft hair, “After Robin and I have our time…maybe we   could all get together as well…I think I’d really like that.”</p>
<p>            With that, Nami brushed some of Margaret’s   hair back and kissed her forehead. She smiled once more, “Thanks again,   Margaret…just for you, I will say it: I’m your first. Love you…”</p>
<p>            She looked up at the starry sky, smiling, “We   have another long day tomorrow…let’s do our best.”</p>
