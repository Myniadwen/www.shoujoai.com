<h1>I Can't Pay...</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../onepiece/index.html">One Piece</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mouse0910.html">MousE0910</a><br> </h2>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Nami slowly opened her eyes and looked 
around. It was pitch black but that didn&#39;t worry Nami for it was only 
natural at night. She was on the Going Merry, in her room. Vivi was 
sleeping on the floor on a futon next to her bed. Nami slowly got up 
and sneaked around Vivi without waking her up. She went out and looked 
through the window to the room where the others slept. They were all 
soundly asleep. Nami could faintly hear them talking in their sleep. 
She wasn&#39;t sure but it seemed like Luffy and Sanji argued about some 
meat. Nami laughed quietly at their silliness and went back to her room.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Vivi was still sleeping innocently, 
not knowing what is going to happen. Nami quietly leaned over her and 
held her breath. Her heart throbbed intensely. She is really going to 
do it. It is really going to happen! Suddenly, Vivi started kicking 
in her sleep and mumbling. Nami held her breath and hoped Vivi doesn&#39;t 
wake up with a scream that would in turn wake up others. Fortunately, 
Vivi soon calmed down and slept quietly again.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Okay, I&#39;ll do it!” Nami whispered 
to give herself some courage. She has to look confident. She must not 
let Vivi know how nervous she really is. Nami took a deep breath and 
nudged Vivi&#39;s shoulder.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Hey, Vivi. Wake up. Vivi!” she 
whispered urgently.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Vivi opened her eyes sleepily and stretched 
her hands. She lifted her torso and looked at Nami.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Nami-san, what are you--” Nami 
placed her finger on Vivi&#39;s lips.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Shhh! We don&#39;t want to wake up Luffy 
and the other guys. You remember our deal, right?”</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Our deal? What deal?” Vivi was 
clearly confused.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Nami nearly panicked. It would be a 
problem if Vivi forgot about the deal. No, she has to stay calm at times 
like this.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“The deal we made on the Whiskey 
Peak. The only reason why you are still on this ship. Now you remember?”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Nami clearly remembered. She remembered 
it all so vividly, like it happened only hours ago even though it was 
already several days.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Vivi told them that she cannot pay 
the 3,000,000,000 Beli that Nami wanted. However, at that time, it mattered 
little to Nami. She didn&#39;t really have a chance before to see Vivi clearly 
and now, when she stood before her, something strange happened. Nami 
felt lust. For some strange reason, Nami wanted Vivi. Every time Nami 
looked at her, she got almost unbearable urge to make out with her. 
At first, it was a huge shock. Nami couldn&#39;t believe she can have such 
feelings for another woman. But then it struck her. She never liked 
men in the first place. When she was small, there were many girls that 
admired the young men and boys from the village because they were handsome. 
However, Nami never felt a single thing. She always ignored them and 
ran straight home, where Nojiko, her adoptive sister, waited. Nami always 
liked Nojiko but she thought it was because they are sisters. However, 
when Nami saw Vivi, she finally realized the truth. Nojiko was her very 
first true love. She was sure about it. And now, Vivi was making her 
heart race the same way as Nojiko did. It was love on the first sight. 
She has to do something! Nami desperately thought about what to do when 
she got an idea.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">After Luffy promised Vivi to take her 
to Arabasta, Nami took her into a dark alley.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Listen, princess. I know that idiot 
promised to escort you but don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be free. We are 
pirates after all.”</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“I… I…” Vivi was shocked at 
Nami&#39;s sudden pressure. “I already told you I can&#39;t pay the price. 
It&#39;s just too much.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Even so, we don&#39;t work for free 
and now that Crocodile is after us, the price raises even more. 5,000,000,000 
Belli. If you don&#39;t pay, we&#39;ll give you to Crocodile in exchange for 
him letting us free.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“What? But… But there&#39;s no way 
for me to pay!” Vivi broke into tears. “I can&#39;t pay… I can&#39;t pay…”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Vivi wailed in cruel realization. She 
was sure that the Arabasta kingdom is done for.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Nami saw her chance. She knelt to Vivi 
and gently stroked her hair.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Don&#39;t cry, princess. There is a 
way for you to pay.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“What are you talking about?” Vivi 
cried while desperately clutching to Nami.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Nami leaned to Vivi&#39;s ear and whispered: 
“You can sell your body to me.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Vivi&#39;s eyes grew in shock and she slowly 
turned to Nami&#39;s face.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“My… My body? No way…” Vivi 
looked at Nami and expected her to say something like “Just kidding!” 
any second. But Nami looked serious.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“So? What is your answer? I will 
buy you as my personal slave for 5,000,000,000 Belli. Do you accept 
the deal?”</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Vivi sobbed and desperately looked 
around herself. Nobody was in sight. There was no escape. She summoned 
all her courage and slowly raised her face with tears in her eyes.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“I… I accept the deal. I will be 
your personal slave. Just help me save my kingdom.” Vivi said meekly 
before collapsing at Nami&#39;s feet, crying in despair.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">That was long ago and Vivi almost forgot 
about the deal. Nami never wanted anything and never mentioned the deal. 
Until now.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“I remember, Nami-san.” Vivi rose 
from her futon and knelt before Nami.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“My body is yours to use.” Vivi&#39;s 
eyes were completely expressionless and it was clear that she was scared 
of what is going to happen to her</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Don&#39;t mind if I do!” Nami leaned 
and kissed Vivi softly on the lips. She pushed Vivi on the floor while 
kissing her passionately. Vivi tried to struggle but it was of no use. 
Nami slowly rose herself and looked in Vivi&#39;s teary eyes.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“You don&#39;t like this, am I right?” 
Nami&#39;s eyes were full of compassion. Vivi nodded lightly, tears pouring 
from her eyes.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“I never had sex with anyone before. 
I never even kissed. You stole my first kiss.” Vivi sobbed through 
her tears.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“I&#39;m sorry Vivi. I truly am. Even 
so, I can&#39;t control myself. Sorry.” Nami once again pressed her lips 
on Vivi&#39;s while her hand slowly slid Vivi&#39;s shirt away.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“No… No… Please. Let me be!” 
Vivi cried in anguish.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Nami knew she has to do something or 
Vivi is going to make too much racket. She hated herself for doing such 
things to Vivi but she couldn&#39;t help it. The urge was simply too strong.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Vivi.” Nami stroked Vivi&#39;s face 
gently. “Remember the deal we have. You have no choice in this. Don&#39;t 
fight. You&#39;re making things harder for both of us. If you don&#39;t do as 
I say, we&#39;re bringing you to Crocodile.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">At mention of Crocodile&#39;s name, Vivi 
became stiff under her and stopped struggling. Nami almost broke into 
tears at her blackmailing. She hated it but she loved Vivi so much.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Nami&#39;s hand caressed Vivi&#39;s breast 
gently. Vivi let out a slight moan and started tremble a little.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Don&#39;t worry Vivi. I will make you 
feel good. Just relax and you will enjoy it too.” Nami tried to encourage 
Vivi a little but that didn&#39;t seem to work. Nami moved herself lower 
and slid Vivi&#39;s panties down.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“No! What are you doing?! Nami-san!” 
Vivi had trouble restraining herself from screaming.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Nami-san, please. Don&#39;t do this!” 
Vivi whispered urgently but Nami ignored her.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Nami placed a kiss between Vivi&#39;s legs 
and smiled at her. “Don&#39;t worry. It feels good. Trust me.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Vivi shook as Nami worked her tongue. 
The feelings she experienced were something unreal. She never felt like 
this. Vivi hated to admit it but it actually felt somewhat good. Vivi 
moaned stronger, barely keeping her voice down. She struggled with her 
feelings. She knew it should bother her but her body betrayed her mind. 
Nami slowly inserted a finger in Vivi&#39;s vagina and Vivi exploded in 
a feeling of ecstasy. She felt a wave of great sensation spread through 
her body. Vivi&#39;s whole body trembled uncontrollably as she was experiencing 
her very first orgasm. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“It felt good, right?” Nami smiled 
and licked Vivi&#39;s juices from her finger.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Vivi could only nod her head a little 
because violent spasms still shook her body.  Nami couldn&#39;t resist 
and kissed Vivi passionately. She brought her head to Vivi&#39;s ears and 
whispered: “I&#39;m not done yet. I will show you what a true pleasure 
is.”</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Yes, please do. My body is yours 
to use.” Vivi was completely overwhelmed by the new exciting felling 
and she wanted to feel more. Nami smiled at Vivi&#39;s response. She lifted 
the candle from the table and gently blew it out. This is going to be 
a long night.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Vivi sleepily opened her eyes. She 
was looking right into Nami&#39;s sleeping face. They held each other in 
a tight embrace. Vivi tightened her embrace and pressed herself on Nami 
tightly. She has decided. Hear heart has resolved. Even though Nami 
was still sleeping, Vivi whispered silently: “Thank you, Nami-san. 
You showed me something amazing. I know this may sound strange but I 
think I love you. During that night, I struggled to understand my feelings. 
Now I see that it was useless effort. I shouldn&#39;t try to understand 
feelings. If feelings were to be understood, they would not be feelings 
anymore, right? I love you, Nami-san. I know I&#39;m just your slave and 
you are just using my body but I still love you. I love you eternally.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Suddenly, Vivi gasped when Nami&#39;s hand 
started stroking Vivi&#39;s hair. Vivi looked at Nami&#39;s face. Her eyes were 
still closed but a big smile spread on Nami&#39;s lips.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Thank you Vivi. You can&#39;t imagine 
how glad I am to hear that. I truly am. I thought you would hate me 
after that night. I love you Vivi and I have loved you since the time 
I first saw you. I want to be with you forever.”</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Nami-san!” Vivi cried tears of 
joy.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Nami gently kissed Vivi&#39;s forehead 
and raised herself from the floor.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Now, how about we take a shower 
before those guys wake up?” Nami winked at Vivi in a playful manner.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“You mean… together?” Vivi looked 
at Nami in expectation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Of course!” Nami smiled at Vivi 
and gestured her hand. “Come.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">A huge smile stretched Vivi&#39;s lips 
as she ran to her new-found lover.</font></p>
