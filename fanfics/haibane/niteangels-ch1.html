<h1>Night of the Angels' Harmony</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../haibane/index.html">Haibane Renmei</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tenchipachy.html">Tenchi-Pachy</a><br> </h2>
<pre>      [There is no place within the original story&#39;s continuity where 
this fanfic can fit, so it is better to think of this as taking place in 
a different continuity
      There is nothing real sexually graphic. Regardless, I never wrote 
a lovemaking scene before (let alone a semi- one), so if it feels hokey 
or sappy to you, then sorry. But I tried making the romance between 
Rakka and Reki as sweet as possible, so I hope you enjoy this fanfic in 
that aspect at least.]
      
      One of the things Rakka first noticed about Reki was her beautiful 
long black hair. Her wings were striking too, but all the Haibane had 
wings. To touch Reki&#39;s hair was like making contact with the waterfall 
of silky night. It seemed to be Reki&#39;s defining feature of beauty that 
set her apart from all the other Haibane at Old Home.
      When Rakka professed her love to Reki, she had not much idea of 
what she was getting herself into, and she was anxious about whether she 
was making a fool out of herself doing so. But Reki returned her love, 
which made her happy and stunned at once. Reki then eventually offered 
Rakka to sleep in her room with her. Rakka became even more anxious, but 
she could not turn down Reki&#39;s invitation. To her it was like taking an 
enormous step, one of which where she was afraid of losing her balance 
and falling over in the process. Regardless of her fear, Reki was there 
to hold her, reassure her, and guide her. When Rakka entered Reki&#39;s 
bedroom, she had entered a whole new world where whoever she was before 
was irrelevant from then onwards. Her innocence ebbed away as she shared 
intimate contact with Reki, snuggling beside her body within her warm 
bed, although they remained fully clothes in their PJ&#39;s as they did so. 
They would wake up in the mornings, kiss each other, maybe stroke each 
other&#39;s plush wings, and then move on with their day together.
      It continued for a week, and this morning is no different. Rakka 
now gazes at Reki as she changes herself. Reki is wearing nothing at the 
moment except for her bra and panties, the same as Rakka. Rakka had 
gazed at her like this before, but every morning it feels as if she 
never had before, and she keeps attentive for whatever she may have 
missed. Reki has naturally smooth, willowy skin with long and strong 
legs. Her arms are even slenderer, an invitation of warmth and security 
she had always felt when she was held by them.
      What is particularly keeping Rakka&#39;s eyes this morning is Reki&#39;s 
stomach. Flat, healthy, well-figured, dotted in the center by a 
complementary innie. Rakka had subconsciously wondered why she found 
Reki&#39;s navel so attractive, and it is just now she surmises that it 
complements the rest of Reki&#39;s front. Any girl can have a smooth 
stomach, but it is the small pit at the center that makes one recognize 
that there is a stomach to notice at all, which leads one to notice the 
rest of the girl&#39;s figure. Rakka does not remember having ever fallen in 
love with another boy in her previous life, but she is not sure whether 
the navel can be as symbolically beautiful on a boy as it would on 
another girl, let alone Reki. It helps her appreciate the rest of Reki&#39;s 
body.
      She now looks at Reki in her full half-nudity, along with her 
ebony hair and the extended wings on her back that give her a truly 
angelic presence in the room.
      At that point Rakka notices Reki looking right back at her as she 
is combing her hair, catching her gaze in the act. Reki almost chuckles, 
asking, &quot;What part of me are you looking at this time?&quot;
      Rakka almost reflexively looks away in embarrassment, but just as 
quickly realizes she should not have to. They are lovers now. It does 
not stop her from blushing, however. Regardless, she keeps her eyes on 
Reki and smiles, saying, &quot;You&#39;ve always been so beautiful, Reki.&quot;
      Reki smiles in response. &quot;Not as beautiful as you are, Rakka.&quot;
      That is when Rakka shifts somewhat. Calling Reki beautiful is one 
thing because Rakka truly believes it. Being called as such in return is 
still a little weird for her. She continues putting her clothes on the 
same as Reki. It takes her a littler longer than Reki because she tends 
to have more trouble with getting her wings to fit through the shirt 
slits on her back.
      Reki fixates on Rakka, the salvation of her own soul. They have 
given each other so much, but even now Reki feels there could be more. 
There should be more. In her mind&#39;s eye, she can see a new bridge in the 
distance that she and Rakka could cross, but she can not make out the 
form of it because of how far away it is now. She wants to take Rakka 
there and convince her how beautiful she is, how much she loves her. 
They can only show so much of that with all the kissing, snuggling, 
embracement, and hand-holding they have done so far. But it all does not 
seem enough for their souls to be closer, to truly be together with 
these intimacies. Reki had caught the gaze in Rakka&#39;s eyes, and she 
could recognize the desire from within that is waiting to be lured out.
      An idea strikes Reki from out of the blue; there is a way. It is 
the way that she thought she had long forgotten from her previous life, 
now uncovered through a fated causality she knows to be Rakka. She knows 
the form of the bridge now, but the crossing is still far away for now. 
She wants to do it with Rakka, but as she occupies with her dressing, 
she realizes that there would be consequences if she did. It was implied 
by the town&#39;s Communicator that Haibane should not love or form an 
intimacy lest a variety of risks. Reki and Rakka were willing to accept 
them, but what Reki wants to do would be different on a borderline 
degree. Reki frowns to herself; it is not like her to do what she plans 
to do when she picks Rakka up from work, but she is for once willing to 
let go of her pride for both her sake and Rakka&#39;s.
      &quot;Reki,&quot; Rakka said, noticing Reki&#39;s expressions, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;
      Reki smiles. &quot;Nothing, sweetheart.&quot;
      
      All the Haibane of Old Home go about their separate daily jobs in 
the town of Glie. Hikari works at the bakery, Kana goes to the clock 
tower and Nemu to the library. Reki stays back at Old Home to take care 
of the little Haibane, while Rakka is employed by the Communicator to 
work within the mysterious walls that serve as the perimeters of the 
town. Like the previous week, Reki takes leave of her work at the end of 
the day on her scooter to go and pick up Rakka. Rakka could easily just 
walk back home, but ever since they found each other she just could not 
turn down Reki&#39;s wishes.
      After taking leave, Reki decides to see the Communicator much 
earlier before getting Rakka. She goes through the same procedure of not 
verbally speaking until the Communicator grants her permission.
      Reki sighs, uncertain how to start. She soon says, &quot;I wish to be 
granted permission for something.&quot;
      Even though she cannot see the Communicator&#39;s face through his 
mask, she gets the sense that he is somewhat surprised by this plea. In 
her earlier years in Glie, Reki had almost always been rebellious 
without a care of other&#39;s assents, especially that of the authorities. 
She had matured over time, and changed even favorably ever since a 
certain new Haibane came to live with her at Old Home.
      &quot;What is it you request permission for?&quot; the Communicator asks.
      Reki gulps a little before saying, &quot;There is a person, one who I 
care deeply for more than anyone or anything else in the world. I wish 
to express my love-but I want to make sure it would not do any harm.&quot; 
After confessing the love she and Rakka share, she then reveals what it 
is she wants to do.
      The Communicator just looks at her studiously, not answering for a 
moment. Reki wonders if she were to become rebellious again if he were 
to say no to her.
      
      Rakka holds tight onto Reki&#39;s back as they soar on Reki&#39;s scooter 
all the way back to Old Home. Even as they interact with their friends, 
Nemu, Kana and Hikari, about the interesting parts of their day like 
they usually did, Rakka can sense something else in Reki. Reki had not 
taken off her jacket at the dinner table like she usually did, and there 
was something about Reki&#39;s aura that gave the feeling she is going to 
surprise Rakka with something. Surprise her with what, Rakka can barely 
imagine. They have already given each other so much, what else could 
they add to their passage of time together?
      The first hint to her answer was when Reki and she mutually agree 
to go to bed, and Reki gives Rakka her warmest smile yet. Rakka follows 
her close behind toward their bedroom. As soon as they enter Reki gently 
shuts the door. She then takes a moment to pause, before taking her 
jacket off. Rakka can then see that there are vertical slits on the back 
of her shirt down from beneath her wings. Before Rakka can verbally 
question it Reki then faces her again. Her expression suggests she has 
something pressing but does not know how to put it in words. Rakka 
smiles in response, hoping it lets Reki know she is ready to hear what 
she has to say.
      Reki places both hands on where her heart is before beginning. 
&quot;Every moment I&#39;ve spent with you has been like a Heaven better than any 
book can describe. When I have you in my arms, when we listen to each 
other&#39;s heartbeats, I&#39;ve wanted nothing more than our souls to unite in 
eternal bliss. You have given me so much, Rakka. Tonight, I want to 
prove to you how much I love you.&quot;
      Rakka almost chuckles. &quot;*Prove* to me? But there&#39;s nothing to 
prove!&quot;
      &quot;I believe there is,&quot; Reki said, who now wraps her arms around her 
torso, as if holding herself up from whatever momentum is gaining upon 
her. &quot;I want to be truly intimate with you, Rakka, in a way like we 
never had before. It won&#39;t be entirely all the way tonight, I&#39;ll tell 
you that now-but I still want you to experience it with me. It&#39;ll be a 
little scary, I&#39;m sure-but I would never hurt you. If you want to stop 
at some point or don&#39;t want to do it at all, I&#39;ll understand.&quot;
      Feeling a little confused, Rakka feels like her inner organs are 
being sucked right into a vacuum from within. She has never seen Reki 
acting so, for lack of a better word, vulnerable. She is baring her soul 
to her, wanting to raise their mutual closeness. It is so strangely 
ironic because in their relationship it had always been the other way 
around. Rakka instinctively wants to hold Reki, but then realizes that 
is not what Reki wants from her tonight. It slowly dawns on her what 
Reki is requesting from her, and truth be told, she is afraid. But it is 
like Reki said, she would never hurt her. Every little new thing Rakka 
has done with Reki ever since they became a couple had been a joy for 
her because she does not remember having ever done them before. Now they 
are a daily part of her life, making her not remember what she was like 
beforehand, but they may be doing something even more enlivening 
tonight. She is afraid, but at the same time excited, making her 
confused in what she wants to do.
      Reki&#39;s placid smile fades. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;
      Rakka instantly makes up her mind and grasps Reki&#39;s arms. &quot;No, 
Reki. I was unsure at first, but-I want to do whatever you want to do 
with you.&quot;
      Rakka&#39;s heart thumps like crazy. She can almost hear it as a 
double beat, wondering if she is actually also hearing Reki&#39;s own rising 
heartbeat. Both would be intermingling within the room&#39;s atmosphere and 
enveloping them as one.
      Reki&#39;s smile returns, a more genuine one than last. She backs a 
little away out of Rakka&#39;s grasp. Keeping her eyes locked on Rakka, Reki 
slowly pulls her skirt down, leaving her panties on but still revealing 
her slender but strong legs.
      Rakka is at first confused why Reki is doing it slowly. Reki, on 
the other hand, wants them to have a great moment together, and figures 
it best to break Rakka in one step at a time.
      Her eyes still fixed on Rakka&#39;s, Reki then grasps the bottom of 
her shirt on both sides. She lifts slowly above her stomach, revealing 
its entire splendor along with the navel that had caught Rakka&#39;s eyes 
just this morning. Reki does not stop there, and by then Rakka realizes 
why Reki tore slits under her wings. With smooth grace, the angel pulls 
her shirt all the way over her head, her halo not providing any 
obstacle, and drops it to the floor. She is not wearing her bra.
      Rakka&#39;s being almost overcomes in weakness, nearing close to 
buckling her knees. To think that the first ethos that attracted Rakka 
was Reki&#39;s hair, then it was her arms and legs, and then her navel. 
Tonight she fixates on Reki&#39;s healthy breasts in all their apparent 
softness and invitation. Gazing upon them Rakka feels as if a girl&#39;s 
bosom signifies an extension of tenderness and security. She has always 
thought Reki beautiful, but now she appreciates it like never before.
      Reki&#39;s smile twitches a little, due to Rakka&#39;s apparent expression 
of bewilderment and steady breathing. Reki inches closer to her. Rakka 
instinctively but slightly bends back.
      &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid, Rakka.&quot;
      Rakka snaps back to attention. &quot;No, I&#39;m not-&quot; she stops, pauses, 
takes a breath, and regains as much of her composure as possible. &quot;I&#39;m 
not afraid, Reki,&quot; she said, and meant it.
      Reki&#39;s smile from before is gone, but her expression retains her 
warmth. &quot;Then touch me.&quot;
      Rakka does not notice that Reki had her hands on hers, slowly 
guiding them to Reki&#39;s abdomen, then pressing them flat against it. 
Rakka&#39;s breathing quickens, but she forces herself to steady, and soon 
her breathing relaxes itself. Reki lets go of Rakka&#39;s hands. Rakka 
starts moving them a little on Reki&#39;s stomach, but then stops. As far as 
she is concerned this is her first time doing this, and she does not 
want to mess it up and feel like a fool. She looks up at Reki 
questioningly, although hopefully without some panicked desperation in 
her eyes.
      Reki gives a reassuring smile. &quot;Do whatever you want tonight, 
Rakka.&quot;
      *Whatever I want tonight,* Rakka thought. She definitely wants to 
feel Reki&#39;s stomach before all else, but probably not so much with just 
her hands.
      Keeping them pressed against Reki, Rakka lays the side of her face 
flat against her stomach, near towards the precious navel. She then 
smoothes her hands and her head over Reki&#39;s torso. Without consciously 
realizing it she starts kissing every part of Reki&#39;s stomach where her 
lips can reach. Her arms move around to Reki&#39;s back. As soon as Rakka 
feels the navel, she gives it more deepening kisses, licking it by 
semi-accident a couple times even, as if hoping to absorb its essence. 
She can feel rather than hear Reki&#39;s steady breathing and slight 
moaning, fueling Rakka in her exploration. As Rakka continues nuzzling 
Reki&#39;s navel, her hands find their way back to Reki&#39;s front and slowly 
smooth their way upwards toward Reki&#39;s chest. Rakka then moves her own 
head upward, leaving the navel for now and kissing up Reki&#39;s front like 
a ladder. Only subconsciously realizing that she had grasped Reki&#39;s 
breasts a second ago, it gives her inborn senses of what to expect next 
as she continues her ascent. Before long she makes contact with them. 
Her hands remain grasped on each breast, savoring their softness and 
warmth. She nuzzles her head between them, coddling into them like she 
would find a new bed to eternally rest upon in them. She kisses both 
breasts, savoring them further. Her hands still on them, she moves her 
kissing further upward toward the neck.
      She then remembers who it is that she has been savoring for who 
knows how long. She gives a quick look at Reki&#39;s panting face, almost 
startled by what she sees. Although Rakka feels she had not done much, 
Reki seems almost drained of some of her energy, her beautiful black 
hair almost fraying as she embraces Rakka close to her. Five minutes 
ago, this would have scared Rakka. Reki was giving herself to her 
tonight, now Rakka wants to give herself in return.
      Without a word Rakka momentarily breaks contact from Reki, and 
hurriedly undresses herself. Because she has no slits like Reki did, it 
takes her longer. She suddenly stops with a feeling of 
self-consciousness. Apparently her old self has not entirely ebbed away; 
there is still something about herself from five minutes ago she must 
master.
      She looks to Reki. &quot;I haven&#39;t fully developed, yet...so please 
don&#39;t laugh.&quot;
      Reki replies plainly, &quot;I would never laugh at you, Rakka. Never.&quot;
      This flips a switch inside Rakka, initiating her to get her skirt 
off. She then proceeds to her panties, but Reki holds her hand to stay 
her. &quot;I need to remind you,&quot; she said with a hint of shame, &quot;We can 
share our bodies, but our underwear must stay on.&quot;
      Rakka notices now that Reki had been keeping her panties on the 
entire time. Rakka does not fully understand, but as long as they can do 
everything else she is grateful enough. Besides, she is too full of 
energy to waste it on thinking tonight.
      She attempts with her shirt, trying to do it fast but not without 
hurting her wings in the process. Feeling that Rakka is going to take a 
while, Reki descends onto her knees, embraces Rakka&#39;s legs and begins 
kissing them upwards. It seems to quicken Rakka&#39;s pace, although Reki 
barely notices it. As soon as she senses that Rakka is fully unclothed, 
sans her underwear, Reki then shifts back to gaze at her lover&#39;s body. 
It is apparent Rakka is shorter than Reki, seems smaller and more 
vulnerable, and is not quite as endowed as some others may think. But it 
does not appall Reki, for she is unable to comprehend seeing that. 
Instead what she sees is Rakka in all her bared splendor, the girl that 
had saved Reki&#39;s soul more than Rakka knows.
      &quot;Don&#39;t ever speak low on yourself again,&quot; Reki said firmly but 
gently, &quot;You are Rakka, and you are mine.&quot;
      Rakka almost bursts to tears with happiness as Reki carries on 
kissing her legs, then gradually makes her ascent past Rakka&#39;s crotch 
and toward her own stomach. Reki kisses Rakka&#39;s own navel the same as 
Rakka had done before gradually continuing upward. Rakka can feel the 
front of Reki&#39;s body as it rubs up against her, and can also feel Reki&#39;s 
outstretched arms raking through the feathers of her wings. In this 
moment, Rakka subconsciously wonders if it was truly Reki&#39;s body she 
fell in love with. As beautiful as she is, especially now, were her 
physical features truly made her such or only in part?
      Reki grasps and feels over Rakka&#39;s back and wings as she kisses up 
her front, chest, and finally her neck. Rakka moans in pleasure. Reki 
continues making her way up, until she stops and gazes right into 
Rakka&#39;s eyes. Rakka then finds her answer. Reki&#39;s body is how Rakka is 
first able to identify with her; it is a part of what makes Reki 
herself. But the true Reki is behind those beautiful eyes, the essence 
that wants to reach out and absorb Rakka&#39;s own. She realizes that it is 
the same for Reki. Rakka&#39;s body did not matter much for Reki&#39;s 
sensuality either, it was Rakka herself that made all the difference 
tonight, what made her beautiful to Reki&#39;s own eyes.
      They kiss with all their passion like never before, pushing their 
fronts against each other, and before either of them knows it they are 
on top of their bed as one.
      
      The next morning, Reki wakes to find herself in bed with Rakka, 
who still remains sleeping peacefully in her arms like a stuffed animal. 
She notices that their wings are messily rumpled, but she does not care. 
It means Rakka and she can spend additional quality time together 
combing each other. Both are still half-naked, and Reki notices that 
their underwear is still on, as much as they need to be in the laundry 
by now. Reki sighs, happy that they have shared their sensual moment 
together but at the same time relieved that they had not taken each 
other&#39;s virginity.
      When she asked the Communicator&#39;s permission for this night, he 
initially questioned her, making sure she is fully aware of the 
separation she and Rakka will have to deal with should the Day of Flight 
come for either of them. Reki replied that that is exactly why she wants 
to do it, because if either one of them were to leave then the other 
would spend the rest of her life in Glie thinking of all the moments 
they could have spent during their remaining time together. The 
Communicator then gave a nod of understanding. Deep down, Reki wondered 
if he had ever been in love the same as she, but it did not occur to her 
to ask at the time. He then gave his final answer in saying that 
whatever Reki and Rakka did, they must not enter each other; that is the 
boundary. Regardless of whatever they experienced in their past lives, 
all Haibane are born pure in Glie, reserving their distinct souls that 
help them on the path to the Day of Flight. If it were ever broken, the 
purity would be lost. He tells her there is no need to know what happens 
afterwards, except the Day of Flight would never come.
      Reki got the gist of what the Communicator told her. If she had 
everything her way, Reki would have definitely wanted to go all the way 
with her one love. She could have just done it, thinking the 
Communicator can go to hell with his rules. But after confiding with the 
Communicator, she knew she would have regretted it more if she betrayed 
his trust as well as the place of her and Rakka in the world of Glie. 
She understood where the line was drawn, but she also understood just 
how far she could go even though the Communicator never verbally 
indicated it.
      The Communicator provided Reki and Rakka access onto the bridge. 
They were able to walk to the very end, but a gate was in solid place to 
prevent them from setting foot on the opposite bank. Instead all they 
could do was look through the gate and imagine what they would have 
experienced if allowed to pervade it. Or they could just stand together 
as one in the middle, gazing down at the river that runs below them or 
at the blue sky that reigns over them, and just take in the atmosphere 
of their limited enjoyment together.
      That was what Reki was able to have with Rakka the other night. 
Even so, she also understands that sexual intimacy is the greatest way 
for two complementary souls to be able to unite, even if just for a 
limited amount of time. One does not always know the true outcome of the 
experience, because it depends on the emotional will that the two souls 
can share with each other. Reki wonders if it would be so much easier if 
she and Rakka literally became one soul, but is convinced otherwise. If 
it were so, she would not have had the experience she has now, and they 
both would not have been able to harmonize with each other in this life 
of theirs. Provided that there are limitations in life in general, let 
alone a relationship, all one has to do is work around them and find the 
favorable aspects to one&#39;s advantage. Whether there truly is a meaning 
to life or no, it makes Reki feel great to be alive at all to find these 
specific fulfillments to enrich her soul.
      She embraces Rakka tightly against her, who gives a soft moan in 
her sleep. Today&#39;s another day, and the following night will be the same 
as well.
      
      [What is it about Rakka and Reki being a couple, in contrast to 
all other (possible) shoujo ai couples in Anime? For me personally, I 
think that they just match. They help each other out, becoming the 
strength for when the other has a weakness. It also helps when overall 
they&#39;re just cute together!
      If you liked it or not, you can send comments back on my e-mail. 
If you had read my other Haibane Renmei fanfic, you can send comments 
for that too. I&#39;m bound to be around for a while, so if you read these 
fanfics in 2008 I&#39;m likely still around to receive your feedback.]
