<pre>Sin and Redemption


&#147;Reki!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&#148;

(huff puff pant). The young lady paused for a moment to catch her 
breathe. She had been running out of the classroom while trying to 
stuff her notes into her bag.

&#147;Sorry. Did you wait a long time?&#148;
&#147;Mmm&#133;not really. I just got here.&#148;
&#147;Good. Let&#146;s go home.&#148;

&#147;Rakka and Reki both walked leisurely to the nearest subway station as 
they both talked about today&#146;s events to each other. It had been five 
long year since Reki had met Rakka at the Juban High School. These 
years had been some of the happiest years of her life. Rakka had been 
her source of strength, joy and happiness. For once, Reki had a sense 
of purpose in her life &#150; there was someone for her to care for, to cry 
and laugh together with and she would never be alone again.

Loneliness? It was difficult to feel lonely anymore when someone you 
really liked was now a constant part of your life.

The two girls were now much older. If she was not already tall to begin 
with, Reki was now even taller. Constant outdoor activity also seemed 
to have given a darker tan. As for Rakka, she of course didn&#146;t look 
quite so childlike and immature anymore and she had blossomed into a 
real woman; far from being a real stunner but still a beautiful sight 
for the eyes with her flowing hair and a fuller figure. It was 
inevitable that Reki occasionally had to wade off overzealous guys from 
hitting on Rakka much to Rakka&#146;s constant amusement.

Of course, Rakka and Reki only used these names in each other&#146;s 
presence. To their classmates, they were Reika and Saki respectively; 
names which they were used to begin called since their birth.

After finishing high school, both girls had applied to the same 
university &#150; Waseda University. To their great joy, both of them had 
been accepted to the same place. They didn&#146;t always see each other 
during the daytime since they didn&#146;t always have the same classes. 
However, they always saw each other after classes in the evenings since 
they both stayed together in the same apartment. It was a modest 
apartment in a quiet location; slightly run-down but functional and it 
was only three subway stations away from campus. The apartment 
sometimes felt bare with the lack of furniture and the windows creaked 
at night but it was comfortable enough for the two of them. They both 
shared the apartment to save money &#150; at least that was what they had 
told their parents thought that was not the only reason&#133;&#133;&#133;.

&#147;It&#146;s your turn to cook tonight,&#148; Rakka said as they approached the 
busy subway station. Her soft voice jolted Reki out of her deep 
thoughts. They both often took turns to split the house chores and 
cooking was one of them.

&#147;Mmm&#133;okay.&#148;
&#147;I wonder what you will be preparing&#133;.say, by the way, the reason I was 
late today was because of Nakajima-sensei. She seems to be on my case 
lately about my late assignments. Looks like I&#146;ll have some stuff to do 
tonight.&#148;
&#147;I think it&#146;s good that she&#146;s actually worried about you. You know that 
it&#146;s a bit different in the university. If you don&#146;t hand in your 
assignments in time, you just fail your course. She could have just&#133;&#148; 
Reki decided to change the topic. &#147;Don&#146;t you worry. Just finish your 
homework while I prepare something nice for dinner,&#148; Reki answered as 
they both boarded the train home.

Later that night after dinner, both Rakk and Reki were lying together 
in their tatami mattresses. Both of them often would huddle together on 
late nights clad in only their nightgowns or sometimes in their 
negligee and just talk about anything under the sky until they both 
grew weary and fell asleep.

&#147;Finished your homework?&#148; Reki gently stroked Rakka&#146;s hair as she asked 
her with genuine concern.
&#147;Yes. Dinner was delicious by the way.&#148; Rakka had one hand around 
Reki&#146;s waist.
&#147;That? Oh, it was just a simple dish of rice and fish. Anyone could 
have prepared that.&#148;
&#147;You&#146;re very modest.&#148; Rakka moved closer to Reki. &#147;Say&#133;.don&#146;t you have 
to work at the orphanage tomorrow?&#148;
&#147;Yes. It doesn&#146;t pay well but I like the job. Besides, Ms. Kuwashima is 
a good employer.&#148;

Reki&#146;s thoughts shifted to her job at the local orphanage not too far 
away. She had just start working there a month ago and worked there 
mostly during the weekends when she didn&#146;t have any classes. The 
children could be naughty at times but they respected her for the most 
part at least, with the exception of one or two brats. The woman in 
charge of the orphanage, a bespectacled woman in her mid-thirties 
called Kuwashima was friendly and kind and it was always pleasant to 
work under her.

Rakka yawned. She was clearly getting sleepy.
&#147;You&#146;re sleepy. It&#146;s time to sleep,&#148; Reki said as she put a protective 
arm around Rakka. She gave a little kiss to Rakka on her cheek. Rakka 
responded similarly and embraced Reki tighter. Both women snuggled 
closer to each other.

&#147;Remind me again, what does the name &#147;Reki&#148; mean?&#148;
&#147;A pebble.&#148;
&#147;And Rakka?&#148;
&#147;Falling.&#148;

Rakka yawned again as her eyelids grew heavier and heavier. Finally, 
the two women closed their eye with their arms around each other and 
pretty soon the only sounds that could be heard was the harmonious soft 
breathing of the two women together with the soothing sound of the 
crickets outside.


&#147;You&#133;&#133;YOU LITTLE BRAT!!!!! Just wait till I get my hands on you!&#148;

Reki was positively fuming. Part of her face and the front of her dress 
had food stains. She was facing the culprit &#150; a little boy who was 
grinning with glee and running around the dining table to avoid getting 
caught by Reki.

&#147;Having fun, I see.&#148; Someone familiar had just walked in.
&#147;Rakka, what are you doing here?&#148; Reki turned to see Rakka coming in 
through the door of the orphanage. Rakka looked amused at all the 
commotion that was going on.

&#147;Nothing. I just thought I&#146;d drop by to see how you were doing. What&#146;s 
going on?&#148;
&#147;T-this little monster. I was trying to get him to finish his soup when 
he threw his bowl at me when I was not looking.&#148;

&#147;But we hate cabbages. And we especially hate cabbage soup,&#148; some of 
the children chorused in unison.
&#147;What nonsense. Cabbages are good for your health. You know if you want 
to grow up strong and healthy, you&#133;..&#148;

&#147;I remember this incident, Reki&#133;.&#148; Rakka suddenly interrupted trying to 
recall something. &#147;&#133;.this was when you and I were still Haibane. The 
young Haibane we were taking care of refused to eat their carrots. You 
then made me demonstrate how delicious carrots were by making me eat 
the carrots and pretending to enjoy them.&#148;

&#147;Say&#133;.that&#146;s not such a bad idea, Rakka. Now why don&#146;t you&#133;.&#148; A sly 
grin was forming n Reki&#146;s face and she motioned towards Rakka who made 
a face at her when she realized what Reki was planning.

&#147;No, no. We want big sister Saki to try the soup!&#148; The children cried 
in unison as if they could read Reki&#146;s mind. It was Reki&#146;s turn to make 
a face. Rakka merely smiled.

&#147;Okay kids, enough of this nonsense. Either you finish your soup now or 
you go to bed this instant without any dessert.&#148; A motherly-looking 
bespectacled woman spoke sternly. The children all immediately started 
lapping their soup as fast as they could.

She turned to Rakka and spoke to her in a matronly voice. &#147;Hi. I&#146;m in 
charge of this orphanage. You must be Saki&#146;s friend. You are&#133;..&#148;
&#147;You must be Ms. Kuwashima. Yes, I&#146;ve heard of you. My name is Rak&#133;I 
mean Reika. Please to meet you.&#148;

Rakka looked at the woman again. While she seemed strict with the kids, 
she didn&#146;t seem like a bad person. In fact, she looked very kind. 
Kuwashima drew Rakka aside and spoke to her in a low voice.

&#147;Did I just hear you call your friend Reki?&#148; She pointed to Reki who 
wasn&#146;t paying attention an was still glaring t the little boy wo had 
thrown his food earlier at her.

&#147;Oh, that&#146;s just a nickname. It&#133;.&#148;

Kuwashima turned to Reki before Rakka could finish talking. &#147;Look. You 
can&#146;t go outside looking like this,&#148; she said as she pointed to the 
food stains on Reki. &#147;Here&#133;..why don&#146;t you get changed and wear one of 
my dresses for now. You can always return it later.&#148; She pointed to one 
of the smaller rooms. Rakka followed Reki who proceeded to go into the 
room to change.

&#147;She seems like a nice woman. A bit strict with the kids but nice 
nonetheless.&#148;
&#147;She did give me a strange look when I first came here for the job 
interview here. Almost as if she had seen her grandmother from th 
grave. After that though, she&#146;s been treaing me nicely almost as if I 
was her own daughter.&#148;
&#147;Daughter? I don&#146;t think she&#146;s that old. If I was guessing correctly, 
she&#146;s probably in her early to mid-thirties.&#148; Rakka gave such a strange 
look that Reki couldn&#146;t help laughing.

Rakka and Reki were standing around talking in one of Ms. Kuwashima&#146;s 
private rooms. Reki had gotten out of her dress and she was just 
standing there in her bra and panties. She was looking at Ms. 
Kuwashima&#146;s wardrobe trying to figure out which dress she should wear. 
Ms. Kuwashima sure had a huge selection of clothes of all shapes and 
colors.

&#147;Pardon me.&#148; Rakka and Reki both jumped. They heaved a sigh of relief 
when they saw that it was only Ms. Kuwashima coming n. Reki had thought 
that it was that little boy from the earlier incident coming in to peek 
at her and she was prepared to give him the royal spanking that he so 
thoroughly deserved. 

&#147;Hmmm&#133;..I thought so.&#148; Kuwashima was busy studying Reki who was getting 
a little nervous.
&#147;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;.&#148;

Kuwashima pointed at the two dark-colored marks on Reki&#146;s back.
&#147;These? Oh, they&#146;re just birthmarks. They&#133;..&#148;
&#147;I have been wondering all this time since I first met you. Then I 
heard about your little story of the Haibane&#133;..&#148;
&#147;You were standing there and you overheard us? Oh&#133;that was just a joke. 
That&#133;.&#148; Rakka blurted out but she was a very unconvincing liar. She 
finally shrugged her shoulders and gave up.

&#147;&#133;.and then I heard our friend here call you Reki. Finally, I noticed 
these marks.&#148; She pointed at Reki who was getting more and more 
nervous. &#147;Interesting. This confirms what I had been thinking all 
along. Your name in your past life was Reki and during that life you 
were a certain being with wings and a halo known as a Haibane.&#148;

&#147;Now&#133;wait a minute&#133;.I&#133;.&#148;

&#147;Here. Let me show you something interesting.&#148;

With a little difficulty, Kuwashima reached out for the zipper on the 
back of her dress and pulled it down exposing her back all the way down 
to the waist. It was bare except for a bra strap and&#133;.

Rakka blinked.
&#147;You have those marks too. You are trying to tell me&#133;.&#148;
&#147;Yes. I was a Haibane with black wings at a certain point in my past 
life. My name then was&#133;.Kuramori.&#148;

Kuramori looked at Reki&#146;s face for any sign of recognition. Seeing 
none, she sighed a sigh of disappointment.

&#147;That name certainly doesn&#146;t bring any sign of recognition to your 
face. You don&#146;t remember anything at all? But you know all about the 
Haibane?&#148;
&#147;She told me. I believe her completely. Because&#133;..because I believe 
that she would never lie to me.&#148;

Kuramori turned to Rakka.
&#147;You, on the other hand, do remember about your past life, right? What 
was your name again?&#148;
&#147;Reika.&#148;
&#147;No I mean when you were a Haibane&#148;
&#147;R-rakka.&#148;
&#147;Okay, Rakka. How much do you actually remember?&#148;
&#147;Mostly only the moments where I was with Reki.&#148;
&#148;I see&#133;.so you met Him and this was what you asked for?&#148;
&#147;I..wait a moment. How can you remember so much too?&#148; (silence) I get 
it&#133;y-you also met Him?&#148;
&#147;As a matter of fact, yes. Apparently, I must have done enough good 
deeds to warrant a meeting with Him. Of course, I don&#146;t remember every 
single thing that occurred but I did ask Him to at least retain my 
memories of two Haibane &#150; one called Reki and another called Nemu. I 
really wanted to see how they would be doing in their next life.&#148;

She proceeded to tell a story about how she took care of two Haibane 
called Reki and Nemu respectively. She felt very sympathetic towards 
Reki expecially with Reki&#146;s black wings because Reki &#147;had to carry her 
sins from her previous life.&#148; She said that she probably identified 
strongly with Reki&#146;s struggles because she herself was also originally 
a Haibane with black wings too and she wanted to make sure that Rei 
would not have to face the same hardships that she had to endure 
herself.

Rakka then told Kuramori how Reki was there for her when she was &#147;born&#148; 
as a Haibane. She talked about how Reki comforted her when she was ill, 
when she was feeling depressed and how Reki always protected her. 
Kuramori didn&#146;t say anything while listening but merely smiled a 
contented smile.

&#147;You know something?&#148; Kuramori finally spoke, &#147;You&#146;re very lucky tat 
you found what you were looking for. I spent over three decades of my 
life not being able to find what I was looking for. It was only now 
that I have finally found Reki.&#148;

Reki had been quiet all this time. She suddenly stood up.

&#147;Kuramori-sensei. I truly don&#146;t remember any of these things. However, 
I wish to sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart for all these 
things which you did for me&#133;as a Haibane. I&#146;m sure it must have been 
tough to take care of someone as troublesome as me. Anyway, I&#146;m truly 
grateful to have had the opportunity to meet you again in this life. 
Once again thanks for everything.&#148; Saying this, the two women gave each 
other a warm embrace.

Kuramore turned to Rakka. &#147;I don&#146;t really know you and I&#146;ve never met 
you in my pas life but thank you for taking care of Reki all this 
time.&#148;
&#147;Actually&#133;.Reki has been the one who has mostly been taking care of 
me.&#148; Rakka turned to look at Reki and both women started to laugh 
loudly. After awhile, Kuramori also started to laugh together with 
them.

When they had all stopped laughing, Kuramori continued to Rakka, 
&#147;Anyhow, I hope to get to know you better. Do stop by here from time to 
time. You can have some of the delicious pastries that I occasionally 
make from time to time.&#148;
&#147;Sure will.&#148;
&#147;I think we both better get going.&#148;
&#148;Mm-hmm.&#148;

The two girls started walking down the street. It was still early at 
night and some of the shops were still open with the hustle and bustle 
of the business running inside. This was mixed with the sounds of 
vendors selling their wares. 

&#147;She seems like a nice person.&#148;
&#147;She sure is. That is probably the second person in about two decades 
of my life who says that they knew me in my past life.&#148;
&#147;I know. Small world, isn&#146;t it?&#148;
&#147;Say, Rakka. Could you wait here for three minutes? I just remembered 
something.&#148;
&#147;Three minutes? Okay. You sure you don&#146;t want me to follow you?&#148;
&#148;No, it&#146;s okay. I won&#146;t take long.&#148;
&#147;Okay.&#148;

&#147;Say it&#146;s getting chilly. While waiting, why don&#146;t you use this?&#148; Reki 
took out a red scarf from her bag. The scarf had the initials &#147;RR&#148; 
which stood for &#147;Rakka and Reki.&#148; Reki had sewn it herself last year.
&#147;I thought it might get a little chilly tonight so I brought this 
along.&#148; Saying this, Reki gently wrapped the red scarf around Rakka&#146;s 
neck. &#147;That should keep you warm while waiting for me.&#148;

Rakka blushed slightly. &#147;You&#146;re always looking out for me. That&#146;s why 
I&#133;really like about you.&#148;

Reki gave Rakka a friendly nudge and went off. She had suddenly 
remembered something that she had seen last night in a nearby shop. She 
had meant to buy it as a surprise for Rakka.

*What was the occasion again? No&#133;.it wasn&#146;t Rakka&#146;s birthday. 
(scratches head). Of course&#133;.it was the fifth anniversary of their 
meeting in high school.*

Reki smiled to herself thinking how surprised Rakka would be to receive 
this present. She walked into the shop and sauntered on to one of the 
shelves to get the item that she was looking for. After some fumbling, 
she found it &#150; a keychain with a cute-looking angel attached. Having 
found what she was looking for, Reki clutched it and walked to the 
counter to pay, feeling satisfied.

There were quite a number of people of all shapes and sizes standing in 
line. They were clutching all kinds of souvenirs and gifts.

*Hmm&#133;.this going to take more than three minutes. More like ten 
minutes. Hang in there Rakka, I&#146;ll be out of here soon.* Reki sighed 
while she looked at her watch.


Three blocks away, another woman was on her way home. Naru had been 
working very hard for the past few days and she was feeling very tired. 
She looked out of the window of her Toyota Cresta. Glancing back at her 
watch, she continued to drive.


After several minutes of waiting, Reki came to the counter.
&#147;How much?&#148;
&#147;Three hundred yen. Thank you.&#148;

Holding the gift carefully, Reki walked to the corner of the street 
where she had told Rakka to wait for her. Reki was imagining how Rakka 
would react when she sensed something different about the surroundings.

Reki felt a strange chill run though her body. A huge crowd had 
gathered around and everyone seemed to be talking in hushed tones. 
Feeling scared, she pushed through the mountain of people trying to get 
a closer view of what was actually going on.

A car had knocked against a lamp post and there was debris everywhere. 
Shattered glass and pieces of broken metal lined the street. A few 
policemen were busy talking to witnesses and there was an ambulance 
nearby.

&#147;Who? What? What is going on here??!!&#148;

Reki saw blood all over the sidewalk. Something else caught her eye &#150; a 
red scarf lying on the ground with the familiar initials of &#147;RR&#148;. She 
also overheard the policemen shaking their heads and talking about 
&#147;&#133;Shocking! That poor girl. The driver hit the girl who was standing 
there waiting for someone. Both the driver and the victim&#133;.&#148;

Reki closed her ears. She really didn&#146;t want to hear anymore. Her whole 
body suddenly felt heavy and she fell with her knees to the ground. 
Unable to control herself any longer, tears started streaming down her 
cheeks. For the first time in a very long time, she cried her feelings 
out while the crowd continued to gather.








In a dimly-lit waiting room of a hospital, a young woman was weeping 
quietly while a slightly older woman was sitting next to her trying 
gently to comfort her. Nurses and hospital staff would occasionally 
walk past them hurriedly without so much as a glance as if they were 
used to the sight of people in grief.

&#147;Why? Why? Why did it have to happen to Rakka? Please tell me, 
Kuramori-sensei.&#148;
&#147;Reki, it&#146;s nobody&#146;s fault. These things happen from time to time and 
could have happened to almost anybody.&#148;
&#147;But it&#146;s not fair. Why Rakka? She&#146;s the sweetest, kindest person and 
she really doesn&#146;t deserve to have this happen to her. Besides, she 
went through a lot just to look for me and&#133;and&#133;&#148;

&#147;I know. You don&#146;t want her to be&#133;&#148; Kuramori stopped deciding that it 
was best not to say what she was contemplating. Instead, she put a 
comforting arm around Reki and continued, &#148;Reki, you&#146;re all she&#146;s got 
right now. Her family is currently in Okinawa to visit relatives. We&#146;ve 
gotten hold of them but under such short notice, it&#146;s going to be at 
least a couple of days or so before they can get a flight back.&#148; 
Kuramori looked Reki in the eyes and continued. &#147;Reki, you&#146;ve got to be 
strong. Not just for yourself but for Rakka too. You&#146;ve got to be there 
for her when she needs you.&#148;

Having calmed down, Reki wiped her tears and stopped crying. She sat 
silently for a moment and finally spoke with some effort. &#147;I&#133;.I&#146;ll try 
my best. For Rakka.&#148;

Reki looked across the room at the other chairs. A young man in casual 
clothing was sitting there and Reki guessed correctly that he must be a 
relative of the driver.

Reki felt a little anger rising inside her. *How dare the driver hurt 
Rakka? It&#146;s all her fault. I hope she gets what she deserves. She 
should just&#133;.*

Reki looked up and saw that they young man was crying silently. His 
face was contorted with grief. She felt a little guilty for thinking 
such negative thoughts and felt that he must be feeling the same 
emotional distress that she was currently experiencing.

The young man wiped his tears. Looking somewhat nervously, he stood up 
for a few moments. After a little hesitation, he walked over to where 
Reki was sitting.

&#147;M-my name is Hyosuke Ishida and I&#146;m the brother of the driver. I&#146;m 
presuming that you&#146;re a close friend of the accident victim?&#148; There was 
a few moments of awkward silence as Reki continued to look at the 
ground without saying anything.

Hyosuke looked rather remorseful but somewhat understanding of the 
situation. He swallowed hard as if he knew what Reki was thinking 
about.

&#147;I understand that no amount of apologizing is going to be able to make 
this up to you but please&#133;I&#146;m begging you&#133;please don&#146;t hate my sister 
Naru for this. She really didn&#146;t mean for all of this to happen. Take 
it out on me instead if that will make you feel better. You see&#133;.Naru&#146;s 
all that I&#146;ve got in this world. Our parents died in an accident when 
we were both young and we&#146;ve both been doing our best to take care of 
each other. Naru&#146;s one of the sweetest and considerate souls you could 
ever meet. She was always smiling and acting nicely and everyone really 
liked her. In fact, she was working very hard at her part-time jobs and 
studying for the entrance exams at the same time. I suspect that 
tonight she might have been working extra hard because she may have 
wanted to get some extra money to buy a present to surprise me for my 
upcoming birthday.&#148;

Hearing all of this, the hard expression on Reki&#146;s face softened 
considerably. She let out a little sigh and turned to face the young 
man. &#147;Relax, I don&#146;t hate either one of you and I&#146;m not angry&#133;at least 
not anymore. I&#146;m just upset that the whole thing happened but there are 
sometimes things that happen beyond our control.&#148;

Listening to Reki&#146;s reassurances, Hyosuke looked like someone who had 
just had a very heavy weight lifted off his shoulders. His stressed 
look became more relaxed.

A slightly older man in a clean, white medical uniform walked over to 
where Reki and Kuramori were sitting. He turned to them and said, 
&#147;Friends of Miss Reika, I presume?&#148; The women nodded anxiously. &#147;Come 
on in&#133;she wants to see you.&#148;

By the dimly-lit table lights, a frail figure was lying on a hospital 
bed. The figure smiled a weak smile and tried to raise her hand up. 
Reki rushed over and clutched Rakka&#146;s soft hands with a little urgency.

&#147;It&#146;s okay, Rakka. It&#146;s me Reki. I&#146;m right here beside you. 
Everything&#146;s going to be fine now.&#148;
&#147;I&#133;I&#146;m so sorry to get you worried like this. It&#146;s my fault that I&#146;m so 
clumsy.&#148;

Rakka spoke in a soft but audible voice. Her expression had brightened 
up considerably since Reki had entered the room. Kuramori merely stood 
beside the two girls saying nothing and nodding occasionally.

&#147;It&#146;s nobody&#146;s fault, Rakka. It just wasn&#146;t our day. I tell you what, 
Rakka. I&#146;ve been saving up on some money. After you get out of 
hospital, why don&#146;t we both go to Tokyo Disneyland? You&#146;ve always 
wanted to go there, right? We&#146;ll have lots of fun &#150; just the two of us 
together.&#148;
&#147;Just the two of us&#133;.in Tokyo Disneyland&#133;.sounds fun. I really look 
forward to this.&#148;

Rakka smiled but Reki could clearly see that Rakka was in a lot of 
physical pain. Reki really wanted to do something but didn&#146;t know what 
to do.
She anxiously turned to the old doctor. &#147;Isn&#146;t there something&#133;anything 
that I can do? I can&#146;t just let her suffer like that.&#148;

Calmly looking at his medical reports, the doctor narrowly eyed Reki 
and replied in a low-toned voice, &#147;I&#146;m afraid that your friend there is 
suffering from severe internal injuries. She needs some organ 
transplants.&#148;
&#147;I&#146;ll do it. If there&#146;s anything I can do, I&#146;ll do it. She can have any 
part of me. I&#146;ll donate whatever it takes to save her.&#148;
&#147;I&#146;m afraid that it&#146;s more complicated than that. You see&#133;&#148; He spoke 
softly into Reki&#146;s ear as she turned pale.
&#147;How&#133;how&#133;&#148;

Rakka had overheard some of the doctor&#146;s conversation with Reki. She 
weakly spoke to Reki, &#147;You don&#146;t have to do it for me. Just the fact 
that you are here and the fact that you have been with me for the past 
few years is good enough.&#148;
&#147;But&#133;but I don&#146;t want you to d&#133;&#148; Reki started crying again. Rakka 
smiled as she clasped Reki&#146;s hand tightly to reassure her. Kuramori 
stood nearby trying to console her.

In the next room, Hyosuke was looking anxiously at the still figure of 
his sister on the hospital bed while a doctor and a nurse stood 
silently watching. Other than the slight sound of a heartbeat on the 
monitor, there was hardly any movement from the body. Naru had been in 
a coma for a while and it wasn&#146;t clear when she would be conscious 
again. Hyosuke sat by his sister&#146;s bedside praying silently&#133;.


A girl walked in an unreal-looking landscape looking lost. Nothing 
looked normal or ordinary and everything seemed to be covered in 
unnatural-looking colors. The path seemed to lead nowhere and it didn&#146;t 
have any proper sense of direction.

A voice startled Naru Ishida. She stopped walking and looked around but 
couldn&#146;t figure out where the voice came from. She heard the voice 
again and realized that the voice was not from anywhere in front of her 
but was coming from inside her head.

&#147;Who are you? Are you God?&#148;
&#147;Some people call me that. I have been called different names from time 
to time ranging from the Almighty to Lord.&#148;
If you&#146;re God, does that mean that I&#146;m dead?&#148;
&#147;No. Actually, you are here for a certain reason. I would like to show 
you something.&#148;

Naru started to see an infinite number of images form inside her head. 
It was like watching a movie projector play in fast motion. 

She saw a number of startling images featuring some strange-looking 
people with halos and short wings. For some strange reason, she knew 
what they were and what they did without needing any explanation. Maybe 
it was just the sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu and remembering that the images 
brought to her.

She looked again. One of them looked rather familiar.

&#147;That&#146;s&#133;me&#133;.in a past life perhaps?&#148;
&#147;Yes. Your name then was Nemu.&#148;
&#147;Who is that girl over there?&#148;
&#147;Her name then was Reki.&#148;

Continuing to look, she felt somewhat embarrassed to see what a sloth 
se was; always falling asleep easily. She also felt somewhat ashamed to 
see how mean and nasty she was towards Reki when she first met her.

Nemu hung her head down guiltily. An air of uneasiness hovered over her 
and she expected God at any minute to reprimand her for her past sins. 
Instead, He spoke, &#147;I would like to show you more. This is from the 
previous life before what we had just seen.&#148;

A set of new images started to form inside Nemu&#146;s head. She was now 
looking at what she guessed was the early 1960s in postwar Japan. The 
picture focused to that of a girl sleeping in class.

&#147;I presume that&#146;s me?&#148;
&#147;Yes, your name then was Moe.&#148;

Nemu continued to observe the images. The girl she was looking at 
apparently never helped her parents with her house chores and never 
helped her classmates to tidy the classroom.

The image of another girl caught her attention.

&#147;This girl looks familiar. Isn&#146;t she&#133;.Reki from the next life?&#148;
&#147;Yes.&#148;

Reki looked slightly different in this incarnation. Nemu could see that 
Reki was always glancing at her from the corner of her eye. Once or 
twice, they interacted with Reki blushing most of the time but Nemu for 
the most part acted indifferently and sometimes coldly towards her. 
Looking at herself in a past life, Nemu guessed that Reki then must 
have harbored a deep admiration for her&#133;maybe more. Reki took Nemu&#146;s 
indifference without any complaints but she was probably used to that 
since Reki then was apparently from a poor background and other 
classmates tended to look down upon her.

Nemu continued to observe the images. Reki was now slipping a letter 
into Nemu&#146;s shoebox locker. Nemu however was too lazy to read it and 
had simply chucked the letter into the trash can.

The scene fast forwarded to a scene of Reki getting drenched in the 
rain while waiting for Nemu who had never shown up at the meeting 
place. Nemu could see that she was crying.

&#147;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;..&#148; Nemu was silent. &#147;I feel terrible for what I did. What 
happened to her after that?&#148;
&#147;Reki killed herself by throwing herself in front of a moving train. 
This happened a few days later.&#148;
&#147;So&#133;.all of this was my fault?&#148;
&#147;Not entirely. Reki had other family problems too. Before she died, you 
actually died first.&#148;
&#147;I did? How?&#148;
&#147;There was an unfortunate accident. You fell asleep while&#133;.&#148;
&#147;That&#146;s okay. I don&#146;t need to hear the rest.&#148;
&#147;There&#146;s something else. Let me show you something from the present 
time.&#148;

In her mind&#146;s eye, Nemu felt like she was not looking at some faded 
flashbacks but she was actually like&#133;.looking out of a window. She saw 
some familiar faces looking rather somber. One of the girls was crying 
by a hospital bed while a slightly older woman looked on.

&#147;Isn&#146;t that&#133;.Reki? Why is she crying? Those other two&#133;..they look 
familiar. Weren&#146;t they also from my past life? Are their names not&#133;.&#148;
&#147;Rakka and Kuramori. Kuramori was was the one that took care of you and 
Reki when you first came into the Haibane world. Rakka is the one that 
made a promise to meet Reki again in the next life.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t understand&#133;.why is she&#133;?&#148; Realization suddenly dawned upon 
Nemu as her facial expression paled. &#147;&#133;I see&#133;.she&#146;s the one I ran 
over?&#148;
Nemu felt guilty. In three successive lives, she had been the one that 
was responsible for causing so much hurt and pain to Reki.

&#147;I understand now. These are sins of which I am guilty of. I&#146;m going to 
be reborn again as a Haibane? Or perhaps I am going to&#133;..eternal 
damnation in Hell?&#148;

Nemu hung her head down awaiting her judgement. 
*It&#146;s for the best. The things I did were wrong and I completely 
deserve whatever fate is going to befall me.*

&#147;There is something you can do&#133;&#133;&#148;


Akira stirred as the hospital machine started showing signs of activity 
again. He got up when he saw his sister showing signs of movement&#133;.

A nurse had walked into the room where Reki and Kuramori were. She 
spoke softly to the two of them. They both got up, looking a little 
surprised.

&#147;Okay&#133;so she wants to see us now? What does she want to do 
now&#133;.apologize?&#148; Reki looked a little incredulous.
&#147;I think we should go,&#148; Kuramori said trying to sound rational.
&#147;I think you should go too. Listen to what she has to say,&#148; Rakka 
weakly said, overhearing their conversation.
&#147;But&#133;.&#148;
&#147;I&#146;ll be fine. I&#146;ll be waiting for you when you&#146;re done.&#148;

Reluctantly, Reki left the room with Kuramori and walked to the next 
room.

Reki opened the door. Hyosuke who was sitting by his sister&#146;s bed got 
up. He nodded politely at them before leaving the room. The girlon the 
bed was slightly taller than the average Japanese girl but just a tad 
shorter than Reki. She had a fairer complexion and was of a slightly 
chubbier disposition. She however looked like most of her life&#146;s color 
had been drained from her. On seeing the two new visitors to her room, 
she roused herself from her horizontal position.

&#147;Reki! Kuramori-sensei!&#148;
&#147;Do&#133;do I know you?&#148; Reki was little startled to hear these names being 
used.
&#147;It&#146;s me&#133;.Nemu.&#148;
Kuramori who had been standing silently looked like she had seen 
someone who had been missing for years.
&#147;Nemu? Is that really you?&#148;
&#147;It&#146;s me. You found me at least.&#148; Realizing that they both knew each 
other, Kuramori walked over to hug the girl on the bed. After the 
reunion, Nemu said haltingly to Reki who was still standing there, 
&#147;Reki, I&#146;m sorry. I&#146;m so sorry. I&#146;ve done it again. In the past few 
lives, I&#146;ve done nothing but cause you pain. And I know that no matter 
how I apologize, it will not make up for the grief you have had to 
endure because of me.&#148;

Reki had been feeling a lot of bitterness in her heart just over an 
hour ago. But now, looking at the tearful girl in front of her 
apologizing over and over again, Reki found that all her anger had 
already dissipated. Her posture lost its tension and she finally sat 
down by the hospital bed.

&#147;You just called us by our names in previous lives. Does this mean that 
you remember the time when we were Haibane?&#148; Kuramori looked curiously 
at Nemu.
&#147;Yes. He showed me everything. I remember how you took care of me and 
Reki and I really do want to thank you for that.&#148;
&#147;He? You mean&#133;.&#148;
&#147;Yes. He even showed me my past life before that. Apparently, I had 
known Reki as far as the 1960s. I can&#146;t believe how horrible I was. I&#146;m 
really sorry. I&#133;..&#148;
&#147;It&#146;s okay. You don&#146;t have to tell me. I understand. You&#146;ve apologized 
enough for three lives.&#148; Reki gently touched Nemu&#146;s jead. Nemu&#146;s cheeks 
were still wet with tears but Reki&#146;s face showed no anger, only 
compassion.

&#147;Listen&#133;.&#148; Nemu&#146;s face showed a little urgency. &#147;The reason I am 
calling you both here is to tell you that I do not have too much time 
left.&#148; Kuramori looked startled but decided that it was best to let 
Nemu finish what she wanted to say. Turning to the doctor who was also 
in the room, Nemu continued. &#147;The girl in the next room&#133;.I understand 
that she needs some organ donations. When it&#146;s all over for me&#133;she can 
have mine.&#148; The doctor nodded and left the room.

&#147;What are you talking about? We&#146;re all going to get through this! Then 
the four of us &#150; me, Rakka, Kuramori-sensei and you, Nemu can start all 
over again. Forget about the past mistakes and work over doing new 
things together.&#148;

Nemu shook her head. &#147;No. You see&#133;.He works in mysterious ways. It is 
fate that makes our paths intertwined through different lives and 
incarnations. Fate has brought me here for a purpose&#133;to seek redemption 
for my sins and to do the correct thing.&#148;

Reki embraced Nemu tightly. She didn&#146;t understand why she was crying 
considering that she had just met Nemu but she felt like she was about 
to lose someone she had known for a very long time.

&#147;But what about your brother?&#148;
&#147;I have been working very hard lately. I&#146;m going to tell him later but 
anyhow I do have some money in my savings. It&#146;s not much but it should 
make life easier for him. He&#146;s not going to be lonely if that&#146;s what 
you&#146;re worried about. There&#146;s this really cute girl at my workplace. He 
doesn&#146;t know it yet but she likes him and she will be confessing to him 
soon. She&#146;s take good care of him.&#148; Nemu suddenly smiled and whispered, 
&#147;Speaking of which, when we were Haibane, I knew how much you and Rakka 
were in love with each other.&#148; Reki blushed. Kuramori stood there 
looking puzzled, unable to hear what Nemu had just said.
&#147;I need to speak to my brother now. Rakka needs you now. I&#146;m glad that 
we were able to meet again in this life.&#148; The three women hugged warmly 
for a last time before parting.

Reki and Kuramori walked back solemnly to Rakka&#146;s room with Reki 
occasionally glancing back. She knew what was coming was inevitable 
though and there was nothing she could do about it. She passed Hyousuke 
who smiled faintly at her as he went to see his sister for the very 
last time.

Half an hour later&#133;..the hospital machine in the next room stopped 
showing any signs of life&#133;&#133;


Nemu had no idea how much time had passed. However, she found herself 
in the strange-looking landscape with unreal-looking colors again and 
guessed that this time she was really dead. She figured out that it was 
only a matter of time before she was sent to face the punishment that 
she justly deserved for all her sins.

She was startled to hear a voice fill her head. She knew immediately 
that she was in His presence again. She dropped her head meekly and 
said, &#147;It&#146;s me. I&#146;m ready for my punishment.&#148;
&#147;Punishment? Why would you be punished? I intend to take you somewhere 
with Me.&#148;
&#147;Take me? Where to?&#148;
&#147;A very nice place up here. Some of you humans call it paradise and 
some of you call it heaven.&#148;
&#147;I don&#146;t understand. I am a sinner. I have sinned.&#148;
&#147;Here. Let me show you something.&#148;

A series of images began to form in Nemu&#146;s head. The images started to 
focus on a recent incident. Nemu was driving her used Toyota one night 
after a hard day&#146;s work. She had turned into a corner when suddenly a 
stray cat had lurched into the path of her car. Not wanting to run over 
the cat, she had swerved her car out of its path but accidentally lost 
control and&#133;.

&#147;Do you remember now? The accident did not happen because you were 
negligent. The accident happened because you were trying to avoid 
running over the cat. You were trying to protect and preserve life. You 
didn&#146;t mean to hurt anyone. Also considering how you have been taking 
care of your brother, I think that should count as a good enough deed 
to qualify you as a righteous person.&#148;
Nemu felt like a huge weight had been lifted off her chest. She felt 
like saying something but the words just wouldn&#146;t come out.

&#147;I know. You are probably wondering about them and how they are doing. 
I&#146;ll show you.&#148;

The perspective of the images Nemu saw started to change. She almost 
felt like she was looking in through a window.

The scene was in a hospital room. A doctor had just announced that 
Rakka&#146;s operation was a success and she would be discharged from the 
hospital in a few days. Looking elated, Reki rushed forward to kiss 
Rakka much to her embarrassment while Kuramore looked rather amused at 
the how spectacle. After the excitement had died down, Reki presented a 
little present &#150; a little keychain with a figure of a cute angel 
attached to it &#150; to Rakka. Rakka took it smilingly and embraced Reki 
tenderly. The scene faded and the last thing Nemu saw was their happy 
faces.

&#147;It is time for us to go. Don&#146;t worry about them. If they continue the 
way they have been living their lives, they should be joining you up 
here soon. Considering that time moves differently here, it won&#146;t be 
such a long wait for you.&#148;

Nemu smiled. &#147;Goodbye Reki, Rakka and Kuramori. I&#146;ll be waiting for you 
up here,&#148; she whispered while looking back for the last time. She 
advanced towards the approaching light before fading into the distance.
