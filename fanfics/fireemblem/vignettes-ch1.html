<h2>a <a href="../fireemblem/index.html">Fire Emblem</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sjaye.html">Sara Jaye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>01. Comfort
&quot;Thank you, Florina...you&#39;re right, it wouldn&#39;t do us any good to lose 
heart now,&quot; Lyn said, comforted by the words of encouragement.
02. Kiss
It was almost amusing how a simple kiss on the cheek could still make 
Florina blush even after they&#39;d been together over two years.
03. Soft
&quot;These pillows are even softer than Huey&#39;s feathers!&quot; Florina giggled as 
she made herself comfortable in Lyn&#39;s bed.
04. Pain
Florina tried to keep going despite the pain in her wounded leg, but Lyn 
wasn&#39;t fooled so easily; when she insisted they stop for the night, 
Florina didn&#39;t argue.
05. Potatoes
&quot;That&#39;s the last of &#39;em,&quot; Lyn said as Florina helped her carry in one 
more sack of potatoes.
06. Rain
If there was one thing they believed in it was that one was never too 
old to splash in the puddles and dance in the rain.
07. Chocolate
One of Florina&#39;s favorite parts about sleeping over at Lyn&#39;s was the 
stash of chocolate Lyn kept under her bed for such occasions.
08. Happiness
&quot;I&#39;m happiest when I&#39;m with you. Does it really matter how I address 
you?&quot; Florina asked, and Lyn couldn&#39;t argue with that.
09. Telephone
Florina didn&#39;t even have to check her caller ID, as soon as the phone 
rang she knew it was Lyn.
10. Ears
When Florina decided to get her ears pierced, Lyn opted for a second 
hole in her left ear so Florina wouldn&#39;t have to go through the six-week 
&quot;recovery&quot; period alone.
11. Name
&quot;My name&#39;s Lyn,&quot; the plainswoman said, extending a hand to the 
frightened girl in the tree.
12. Sensual
The warm water felt good on their sweaty skin, but the water wasn&#39;t the 
only thing heating up in that shower.
13. Death
Florina&#39;s comforting presence eased the pain of her grandfather&#39;s death 
a little more each day.
14. Sex
The first time had been awkward and a bit disappointing for each of 
them, but neither Lyn or Florina had any regrets...after all, it only 
gave them the incentive to try again, as many times as they needed.
15. Touch
&quot;See, Lyn? He&#39;s grown to love you as much as I have, he never lets 
anyone touch his wings except me!&quot;
16. Weakness
Florina knew Lyn&#39;s weaknesses to the point where it was useless to hide 
them, but Lyn wasn&#39;t one to let go of her pride so easily.
17. Tears
The sight of Florina&#39;s tears made Lyn even more determined to destroy 
Migal and his cronies.
18. Speed
&quot;Hurry, the enemy gaining on us!&quot; Florina cried; Lyn held on tightly as 
Huey picked up speed fled through the skies.
19. Wind
What Lyn missed most of all about her homeland was riding on the plains 
with Florina, the wind in their hair.
20. Freedom
Lyn would rather stay in Caelin with Florina forever than live free on 
the plains of Sacae without her.
21. Life
On some nights, even Florina&#39;s comfort wasn&#39;t enough to rid Lyn&#39;s mind 
of the image of her grandfather clinging to life.
22. Jealousy
&quot;What, you&#39;re jealous and think I&#39;m trying to take her away from you?&quot; 
he teased; Lyn bristled at the force with which Hector hit the nail on 
the head.
23. Hands
The swordswoman&#39;s hands felt heavenly as they massaged Florina&#39;s aching 
shoulders.
24. Taste
Lyn didn&#39;t have the heart to tell Florina her chocolate cake tasted more 
like charcoal cake, not after she&#39;d spent hours in the kitchen.
25. Devotion
Florina&#39;s devotion was admirable, but sometimes Lyn couldn&#39;t help 
worrying if she was holding her back.
26. Forever
She could have sat and watched the stars with Lyn forever, but they had 
to go inside sooner or later.
27. Blood
The sight of blood tricking from the cut on Lyn&#39;s arm drove Florina into 
a rage; she raised her lance and drove it into the enemy mercenary&#39;s 
gut, killing him instantly.
28. Sickness
Florina was amazed at how fast Marquess Caelin&#39;s sickness healed in 
Lyn&#39;s presence, but she wasn&#39;t at all surprised; Lyn was the kind of 
person who could cure anyone&#39;s woes and ills.
29. Melody
As Nils played a slow and romantic melody on his flute, Lyn couldn&#39;t 
resist asking Florina to dance with her.
30. Star
When Florina lamented that the fog had stolen even the brightest star in 
the sky, Lyn had to disagree; the light in Florina&#39;s eyes was brighter 
than any star.
31. Home
Feeling the lush green grass beneath her feet as she lay in the field 
with Florina, Lyn knew she was home at last.
32. Confusion
Florina yelped in confusion as Lyn pulled to the side; seconds later the 
archer hidden in the bushes fired a shot that missed them by a mile.
33. Fear
As Florina&#39;s fear of men and confrontation lessened, Lyn began to fear 
that someday Florina might not need her around anymore.
34. Lightning/Thunder
Lyn teased Florina for being scared of a little thunderstorm, but when 
an especially loud crash sounded, she was glad Florina was clinging to 
her.
35. Bonds
Sometimes Lyn envied the bond between Florina and her sisters, she 
wondered what it was like to have siblings.
36. Market
Seeing the mothers with their children in the market made them envious; 
they knew they&#39;d never be able to have children of their own.
37. Technology
&quot;Sometimes I really hate technology,&quot; Lyn groaned as her computer began 
to overheat yet again.
38. Gift
A tired but satisfied Lyn returned from shopping, having finally found 
the perfect Christmas present for Florina.
39. Smile
Seeing Florina smile could brighten even the darkest of Lyn&#39;s days. 
40. Innocence
&quot;If there&#39;s one thing I hate, it&#39;s the harm of innocents!&quot; Lyn growled, 
and Florina could only nod in agreement.
41. Completion
Florina&#39;s signature marked the completion of the scrapbook; she couldn&#39;t 
wait to give it to Lyn on her birthday.
42. Clouds
Dark clouds signaled a storm; Lyn and Florina fled to their tent, not 
wanting to get caught in the rain.
43. Sky
Lyn knew it was impossible, but every time she went flying on Huey&#39;s 
back with Florina she wished the sky could be their home.
44. Heaven
The battle hadn&#39;t gone well, and Florina had been one of the casualties; 
as Lyn wept silently over her grave, Eliwood reassured her that in 
Heaven, she was protected from stray arrows.
45. Hell
Lyn was clearly in hell, having to travel with pirates, and all Florina 
could do was rub her shoulders as she stared angrily into the distance.
46. Sun
As the rising sun marked the end of the war and the beginning of a new 
day, Lyn and Florina embraced in celebration.
47. Moon
Florina stayed up long after Lyn had gone to sleep, gazing out at the 
near-invisible crescent moon in the night sky.
48. Waves
A strong wave washed over the side of the boat, soaking Florina and 
making her look like a wet rat. (continued...)
49. Hair
Florina grumbled angrily and began to wring her hair out, as Lyn 
struggled not to laugh.
50. Supernova
Lyn didn&#39;t want to say so out of fear of sounding cliche, but her first 
kiss with Florina had been as intense as a supernova.</pre>
