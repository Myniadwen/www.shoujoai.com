<h1>Sparks</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../fireemblem/index.html">Fire Emblem</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sjaye.html">Sara Jaye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>There was an instant spark between them when they first met. At least 
Serra thought so. Erk said he couldn&#39;t stand her, but after he got to 
know her, he&#39;d grow to love her like everyone else did.

The spark never flourished.

Erk met Priscilla a year later, and the spark between them was 
noticable. Everyone said they made a very cute couple, they were so 
perfect together.

Serra was jealous. She blamed Priscilla for taking &quot;her&quot; Erk away, 
putting him under her spell. She kept promising herself she&#39;d break them 
up and take back what was hers.

She never did. The spark between Erk and Priscilla never flourished, 
either. The night she told him she might be in love with him, he broke 
her heart.

&quot;I must apologize for having led you on, if I did,&quot; he said, &quot;but I 
cannot pursue a romantic relationship. My studies must remain the main 
focus of my life.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Priscilla said. That night, she cried herself to sleep.

She met Serra the next morning. Serra was about to confront her, but the 
tearstains on Priscilla&#39;s face stopped her in her tracks.

&quot;He dumped you, huh?&quot;

&quot;There never was anything between us, Serra. Erk is a wonderful person, 
but he is, and probably always will be, romantically challenged.&quot;

Now Serra was angry. At least he&#39;d been honest when he&#39;d rejected her, 
but he&#39;d always been so sweetly devoted to Priscilla.

&quot;He lied to you! I&#39;m going to give that jerk a piece of my mind!&quot;

Priscilla shook her head, sniffling.

&quot;No. It was my own fault for being silly enough to think anything would 
happen. Employers aren&#39;t supposed to fall in love with their employees,&quot; 
she said.

Serra sighed. She&#39;d blamed Priscilla for nothing, she knew she couldn&#39;t 
blame Erk, she certainly wasn&#39;t going to blame herself...

There&#39;s no one to blame. I hate it when that happens!

Without a word, she put her arms around Priscilla and let her cry.

Weeks later, a spark began to form between them.

This time, it bloomed.</pre>
