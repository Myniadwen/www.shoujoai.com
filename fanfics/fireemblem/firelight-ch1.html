<pre>&quot;Serra?&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry I got us lost.&quot;

The cleric sighed, scooting closer to the fire to warm her toes.

&quot;You already said that, and I already told you it&#39;s not your fault.&quot; A 
pause. &quot;Merlinus is the one who gave us a bad map, it&#39;s his fault!&quot; she 
added quickly.

Priscilla stifled a laugh. Serra had mellowed out a bit over the past 
few months, but she still had her unpleasant habits. Ducking out of 
accepting blame was one of them, and it was hard to tell whether she was 
trying to break it or not.

&quot;We&#39;ll let him know he gave us the wrong one when we get back to the 
others,&quot;

Serra smiled sheepishly.

&quot;Then again, maybe I should&#39;ve checked it before we left,&quot; she muttered. 
&quot;Sorry about that.&quot;

Priscilla smiled.

&quot;Even the best of us forget things sometimes,&quot; she said, draping a 
blanket over the two of them. Serra gratefully pulled closer, leaning 
her head against Priscilla&#39;s shoulder and closing her eyes.

As Serra slept, Priscilla remained awake, keeping an eye on the fire and 
occasionally studying Serra&#39;s face.

She shines brightly every day, but in the light of the fire she&#39;s 
radiant.</pre>
