<h1>Burning Shrubs and Riverside Conversations</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../fireemblem/index.html">Fire Emblem</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sjaye.html">Sara Jaye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was another ordinary day for Eliwood&#39;s army, and Serra was brushing her
hair and admiring her reflection in the stream.

&quot;Ah, those poor men will hardly be able to keep their eyes off me today,&quot; she
snickered to herself as she tied her hair into its usual bouncy pigtails. She
loved to imagine being surrounded by admirers, blushing like a schoolgirl as
she tried to pick the person she loved the most. They&#39;d shower her with gifts,
make her head spin with compliments, fight each other over who loved her the
most...

A sudden snap broke Serra&#39;s train of thought just then, and she turned around
to see a nearby shrub on fire.

&quot;Aiiee!&quot; she yelped. &quot;Bandits! I must warn the others, they&#39;ll be so grateful
and Lord Hector will-&quot;

&quot;Serra?!&quot;

Recognizing the voice, Serra turned to her right. Priscilla stood next to the
burning shrub, Fire tome in her hand and a sheepish look on her face.

&quot;Of all people! I never expected someone like you to be a pyromaniac!&quot; Serra
gasped, half-kidding. Priscilla laughed nervously.

&quot;I&#39;m not. I was practicing casting anima spells and...&quot; She shuffled her
feet. &quot;I went a little overboard.&quot;

&quot;A little?! You&#39;re lucky it was only a shrub!&quot; Serra grabbed a nearby bucket,
dipped it into the stream, and flung the contents at the blaze. &quot;There. Next
time, maybe you should practice casting fire spells while it&#39;s raining,&quot; she
grumbled.

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry,&quot; Priscilla said. &quot;Did I frighten you?&quot;

&quot;If by frighten you mean scared half to death, then yes,&quot; Serra said. &quot;I
thought you were a bandit! I was about to tell the others we were under attack!&quot;

&quot;Then it&#39;s a good thing I spoke up when I did.&quot; Priscilla smiled wryly. &quot;Once
again, I&#39;m very sorry I scared you.&quot;

You should be, Serra wanted to retort, but Priscilla&#39;s smile made her forget
about being annoyed. &quot;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m sorry I almost got the entire army over
there to fight without realizing it was you,&quot; she said, half-kidding. Priscilla
paled.

&quot;Would you really have done that?&quot; she asked nervously. Serra didn&#39;t know
whether to laugh at the troubadour&#39;s inability to detect humor, or feel bad for
sounding so serious.

&quot;Oh, of course not!&quot; she said. &quot;Well, no more than Lord Eliwood...since he
would&#39;ve told me whether or not there was a need to fight, of course!&quot; she added
quickly. Priscilla smiled, relieved.

&quot;Good.&quot; Her gaze drifted to the Lightning tome at Serra&#39;s side. &quot;I see you&#39;re
just learning to use magic, too?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, Lucius has been helping me out for a while,&quot; Serra said.

&quot;Erk&#39;s been helping me, but I&#39;m thinking of giving him the day off so he can
relax. He does tend to overwork himself,&quot; Priscilla said. Serra almost went
off on a rant about her own experiences with Erk&#39;s obsessive study habits, but
thought better of it. Weird, I&#39;ve never had any qualms about that before...

&quot;Hey, maybe we can practice together tonight,&quot; Priscilla suggested. Serra
blinked.

&quot;Eh?&quot;

&quot;Well, I overheard Raven and Lucius planning to spend some time together
tonight,&quot; Priscilla said, trying to fight back a pang of jealousy at the thought.
&quot;And since I&#39;m giving Erk the night off, I thought we could work together and
show each other what we learned.&quot;

To her horror, Serra found herself blushing at the offer. She&#39;d always
treated Priscilla as a rival for Erk&#39;s attentions and the army&#39;s &quot;main&quot; healer, but
this was the first time they&#39;d ever actually talked despite having shared a
tent for several months. And Priscilla was hardly the tempestuous redheaded
Jezebel Serra&#39;s mind often made her out to be.

I&#39;ve had it wrong all this time, she thought, both relieved that Priscilla
wasn&#39;t truly a threat, and horrified that...well, she&#39;d been wrong.

&quot;Sure, why not?&quot; she finally said.

&quot;Great! Meet me at our tent after dinner tonight,&quot; Priscilla said. &quot;Thank
you, Serra. You know, I&#39;m glad we talked. I&#39;ve been sharing a tent with you for
so long and I feel like we hardly know each other. Maybe tonight we can work on
that, as well.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...that&#39;d be great!&quot; Serra laughed nervously. &quot;See you then!&quot;

Priscilla went back to camp, and Serra ran back to the river to splash her
face with cold water. What had just come over her?! &quot;The last thing I need is
another crush, and on a girl no less,&quot; she muttered.

As soon as the words left her mouth, her stomach tied in a knot.

&quot;Wait a minute! I&#39;m not...I&#39;ve never even entertained the thought of...!&quot;

She buried her head in her hands.

Great. Just what I needed.

This was going to be a long day.</pre>
