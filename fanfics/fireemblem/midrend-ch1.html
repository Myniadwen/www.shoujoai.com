<h1>Midnight Rendezvous</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../fireemblem/index.html">Fire Emblem</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sjaye.html">Sara Jaye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Florina slipped down the corridors to Lyn&#39;s chambers. Despite Lyn 
insisting her grandfather wouldn&#39;t mind Florina sharing a room with her 
liege lady, she was hesitant to ask...especially considering what went on 
in said room most nights.

Sometimes Florina worried they&#39;d be caught, getting Lyn in trouble and
Florina removed from Caelin&#39;s service. But so far, nobody had asked or 
voiced any suspicions, so for now, they could relax.

She knocked softly at the door. Lyn answered and let her in right away.

&quot;I promise, one day I will ask my grandfather about you sleeping closer 
to me,&quot; the noblewoman said.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to...as long as we haven&#39;t been caught, I&#39;m all right.&quot;
Florina smiled and wrapped her arms around Lyn, kissing her. Lyn squeaked 
a little in surprise, Florina had become so bold in the past few weeks!

&quot;That&#39;s good enough for me, then,&quot; she breathed. After making sure the 
door was locked and the windows were secured, she let her hair down, 
followed by her robe and her undergarments. As she laid down on the bed, 
Florina paused for a moment to just stare at her; no matter how many 
times she saw Lyn naked she could never get over how beautiful she was. 
Silently, she dropped her own clothing to the floor and joined her on the 
bed. They kissed again, Lyn&#39;s hands going straight for Florina&#39;s breasts 
only for Florina to pull back and stop her.

&quot;Let me,&quot; she whispered, pushing Lyn gently back against the pillows.

&quot;Florina,&quot; Lyn began to protest, but was silenced by another kiss, 
followed by Florina&#39;s tongue on her nipples. &quot;Ah, that&#39;s nice,&quot; she 
gasped, arching her chest up slightly. Florina lingered at her breasts a 
moment longer before attacking her shoulders and neck. Lyn writhed in 
pleasure; it had taken Florina a long time to memorize her weak spots, 
and once she knew them she took advantage of it to drive Lyn crazy every 
time. She held her breath as Florina slipped a hand between her legs.

Florina gently traced along Lyn&#39;s outer lips, savoring the slick softness
against her fingers. Lyn had to bite back a particularly loud moan as her 
lover suddenly thrust into her. As her fingers busily pumped in and out, 
Florina lowered her head to Lyn&#39;s breasts, kissing, licking and sucking 
them. Occasionally she would withdraw her fingers to rub Lyn&#39;s clit, 
causing Lyn to grind herself against her hand.

&quot;F-Florina...&quot; Lyn was panting now, a sheen of sweat covering her body.
Sensing her impending climax, Florina pressed her lips to Lyn&#39;s nipple, 
licking and sucking vigorously. With one last slip of her fingers, Lyn 
grabbed a pillow and bit it to muffle the scream of her orgasm. Florina 
slowly withdrew her fingers and licked them clean.

&quot;How was I?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Wonderful.&quot; Lyn slowly stood up, a smile on her face and a gleam in her 
eye. &quot;Lie down,&quot; she said. Florina did as told, and Lyn tried to decide 
whether to torture her with slow foreplay, or just dive right in...
Florina did make the most amusing sounds when surprised. Slowly, she 
traced her fingertips along the insides of Florina&#39;s thighs.

&quot;Mmm...&quot; The pegasus knight closed her eyes, moans of both pleasure and
impatience escaping her lips. Then without warning, Lyn knelt between her 
spread legs and parted her labia with her thumbs, burying her mouth 
against the soft wetness there.

Florina nearly bit through her lip to stifle a scream. Lyn&#39;s lips and 
tongue were everywhere, kissing, licking and sucking while deliberately 
ignoring Florina&#39;s clit. Suddenly, her lips brushed against it in the 
lightest of caresses.

&quot;Aaah!&quot; Florina almost came right then and there, but held back; she 
didn&#39;t want this to end. Lyn returned concentration to the inner and 
outer lips another moment before going back to Florina&#39;s clit, brushing 
it softly with her tongue. Even as Florina shook with orgasm, Lyn didn&#39;t 
stop. Florina&#39;s breath was a series of pants and shrieks; she&#39;d barely 
recovered from her first climax and another was firing up.

Lyn suddenly withdrew her tongue and replaced it with her fingers. 
Florina thrust her hips upward and grabbed Lyn&#39;s pillow, burying her face 
in it to stifle a shriek as she orgasmed again, her pussy tightening 
around Lyn&#39;s fingers. Lyn waited for the spasms to stop before removing 
her fingers.

&quot;You&#39;re too much,&quot; Florina panted, struggling to regain control of 
herself. &quot;But...this isn&#39;t fair. I&#39;ve only given you one orgasm, and you 
gave me two!&quot; She suddenly sprang up and eased Lyn into a sitting 
position at the edge of the bed, legs open.

&quot;Florina, you don&#39;t h-AAH!!&quot; Lyn caught her breath as Florina buried her 
face between her legs and lapped hungrily at her before thrusting her 
tongue inside. &quot;Oh God...&quot; She grasped her own breast, pinching the 
nipple and grinding herself against Florina&#39;s mouth, lacing the other 
hand through her lover&#39;s hair.

Florina suddenly withdrew her tongue and lashed it across her lover&#39;s 
clit over and over again. Lyn couldn&#39;t stifle a scream as she orgasmed, 
and Florina continued to lick her until her legs relaxed.

&quot;Ah...t-that&#39;s enough...&quot; Lyn gently pushed at Florina&#39;s head. Florina 
pulled back and sat down on the bed next to Lyn as she caught her breath.

&quot;There. Now we&#39;re even,&quot; she said. Lyn smiled and pulled Florina in for a
kiss, savoring her own taste on the other girl&#39;s lips.

&quot;Maybe now we should go to bed,&quot; Lyn suggested. &quot;Though I&#39;m still not
tired...&quot; She pulled Florina under the covers with her and kissed her, 
slipping her thigh between Florina&#39;s legs. Florina returned the gesture; 
the coolness of Lyn&#39;s thigh felt good against her heated flesh, and the 
friction of Lyn rubbing against her own thigh was just as nice. It didn&#39;t 
take long for either of them to come a fourth and final time.

&quot;That&#39;s enough,&quot; Florina panted, leaning her head on Lyn&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;I think we set a new record,&quot; Lyn giggled. &quot;Wanna try for four next 
time?&quot;

&quot;Let me think about it when I&#39;m less tired,&quot; Florina yawned, closing her
eyes. &quot;Night, Lyn.&quot;

&quot;Goodnight, Florina.&quot; Lyn pulled the covers more tightly around them; 
they&#39;d have to wake up extra early and dress tomorrow before Florina went 
back to her quarters.

It would be easier if they could just share a room. But somehow sneaking
around made it that much more fun.</pre>
