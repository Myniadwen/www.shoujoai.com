<h1>Never Again Will I Slip (part 10 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff102/index.html">Final Fantasy 10-2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jessvolk.html">Jessicka Volkinivia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff102/nevagain-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Paine blinked for a few seconds, unable to comprehend the fact of the 
matter that just a few seconds ago, not even a minute ago, she was in 
the depths of an unknown cave deep within the Macalania Woods.

Now...she was in Luca...no human alive..regardless of the vehicle, could 
make ti to Luca from the Macalania Woods THAT fast.

&quot;So...then...who...or more precisely..WHAT was that girl? She looked 
like a ninja but...the only times I&#39;ve seen skills like that being used 
was only dealing with works of fiction...hm...no use boogling my mind to 
try to figure it out.,..&quot;

She shook her head, as if to wrench the thought from her mind and began 
walking.

She was only walking for a few seconds before she walked into something 
that sent her sprawling on the ground.

&quot;Hey! You got a deathwish or something?&quot; She shouted at the person.

Before her stood a man of around 6&#39;0 tall, weighing around 180 pounds, 
wrapped in a red cloak with one of his arms held up in the cloak as if 
in a sling. He had salt and pepper colored hair, a scar down one of his 
eyes and a paor of silver sunshades.

He glanced down at her and offered his hand. Before she could refuse it, 
or accept it, he grabbed her by her wrist and pulled her to her feet, 
then hoisted her up by her shwl to get a better look at her.

He used his index finger to push her head this way and that way, as if a 
mad scientist was examining his latest specimen for flaws.

Paine tried to break out of his grasp but lately she had been 
encountering people that knew how to distribute their weight or were 
quicker than her...which..to say the least was a bit ...unnerving for 
her.

He looked into her eyes with his own, peering into her soul easily. 
After peering around in her soul for a brief moment, his eyes widened, 
though not noticably, but they did

He shook his head then let her down, uncereminiously on the ground. 
&quot;Hm..&quot;

He turned to walk off, as Paine latched out and grabbed his wrist in an 
attempt to get him to face her, which, needless to say, didn&#39;t work.

She simply sighed and spook to his back. &quot;Who the hell are you?&quot;

The man walked to the edge of the pier and looked up at the sky. The 
cool air, flowing through his hair, flowing against his face, making him 
remember the times when he was..unsent.

Auron, then turned and walked back towards the shops of Luca, before 
Paine questioned his identity once again. He did not acknowledge her 
presence, he just continued to walk along, as if in a daze.

He stopped at the shop that was beisde the blitzball signup booth and 
spoke to the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper nodded and Auron left, heading 
for the bar where the Ronso hungout.

Paine dashed from the docks and got to where the shop that Auron had 
just been by when the shopkeeper spoke to her. &quot;Come here! Yes you! Boy 
have I got a deal for you! Since we accidentally order a hell of a lot 
more stuff then we needed to, I will sell you these, Turbo Ethers, 
X-Potions, all the restorative items, 99 of everything I might add. AND! 
I&#39;ll throw in this backpack to carry then all! All for the low price of 
only...1000 gil! You can&#39;t beat that anywhere else!

Paine thought for a moment...having a feeling that someone was trying to 
help her..and if all of Spira was in the same condition as the Macalania 
Woods were then she would need all the help she could get.

She walked up to the shopkeeper, tossed him the money and checked the 
bookbag to make sure nothing was damanged and nothing looked a weird 
color, then she was about to dash off again, when the shopkeeper spoke 
once more. &quot;He&#39;s inside the Ronso bar.&quot;

Paine nodded and took off. She had to find out who this person was..and 
why he was ignoring her.

When she got there, she pushed the doors open and looked around. There, 
sitting with his head down on the table, was the man she was looking 
for.

&quot;Good...he maybe drunk...now maybe I can get some information out of 
him..&quot; She thought to herself.

She approached him anbd ordered a drink for herself, a Liquid Cocaine to 
be exact.

&quot;So...who are you?&quot; She asked again, hopping he was too drunk to refuse 
to speak with her this time.

He simply pretended like she wasn&#39;t there, yet again and order two more 
shots of Liquid Cocaine, mixed with some whiskey and coke.

After downing about 25 of them, he was feeling his buzz but was not in 
the least bit intoxicated.

He stood up and stretched his arms out, then cracked his neck and 
proceeded for the door, before Paine bounded out of her seat and blocked 
the way. She was noticably intoxicated, but not to the point where she 
didn&#39;t know what she was doing or ay.

&quot;Move out of my way, child..&quot; He said to her, before he pushed her asid. 
Before he got through the doors, he felt the cold, hard steel tip of a 
blade that he had used, a very long time ago...even before he met Yuna 
and company.

He sighed and turned to face her before his fingers gripped the dull 
side of the blade and twisted forward with a quick and forceful move, 
throwing Paine off balance.

After that, he was able to retrieve the blade from her hands, shealthed 
it into his own shealth, and raised his hands up in an offensive 
gesture.

Paine gritted her teeth and charged at him, throwing a powerful punch 
aimed at his head, and it would have connected too(if it wasnt for that 
sniveling unsent and his jug of sake! -shakes fist- )

He easily grabbed her wrist, grabbed her side and kicked her feet from, 
under her, causing her to hit the ground, not as hard as she could have 
but hard enough.

She growled and tried to tackle him, only to have her land back of her 
head on the floor, extremely hard, hard to the point where she knew it 
was cracked open. Thankfully though, it was not, but the way she moved, 
it looked like she might have suffered a minor concussion..

Paine swayed from side to side as she charged him, once again, this 
time, successfully getting her neck, locked into a vice-like grip where 
she knew she would either lose her life or would have to give up.

She choose the latter and barely was able to gasp out. &quot;Enough!&quot;

Auron let her go and slide down the side of the wall letting her head 
rest on his leg. Then he casted a cure spell on her to heal the damage.

Once she was back to herself, she began to speak once more, but before 
she could, his finger stopped on her lips.

&quot;The name&#39;s Auron. I used to own that sword before I gave it to you. 
You&#39;ve diffently gotten stronger but...you still have not reached your 
full potential...Paine...you&#39;re diffently Rikku&#39;s lover...

She blinked and sat up, a bit too quickly, making her head feel like it 
was exploding, her head promptly drifted back down to Auron&#39;s knee.

&quot;How...did...you...know...that...?&quot; She whispered out through the 
excruiating amount of pain.

&quot;I&#39;ve been watching over you...I gave you that necklace...I gave you 
your sword...I gave you your first kill...does the name..Hidenisha ring 
a bell?

She shook her head, trying to clear out any other thoughts so she could 
think. &quot;Yeah...it was...the name of my Great-Great-Great 
Grandfather..but..how would you know that?

&quot;All of your GrandParents had their names etched onto their forearms in 
red ink, correct?

Now she was pissed and angry and confused all at the same time.

&quot;WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU DAMMIT? STOP PLAYING THESE FUCKING GAMES WITH ME!&quot;

Auron chuckled a bit and removed the cloak from around his arm then held 
it up for her to see. Their...in red ink..read the 
letters...H...I...D...E...N...I...S...H...A.&quot;

He then covered his arm back up. &quot;Even after all these years of watching 
over you...you&#39;ve still learned not patience whatsoever...&quot; He began to 
laugh once more

Paine&#39;s mouth widened as well as her eyes for a brief moment, before she 
closed them again. Afterwards, she promptly fainted.

&quot;Girl still hasn&#39;t learned how to handle the truth either...&quot;</pre>
