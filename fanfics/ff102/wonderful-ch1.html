<h1>Isn't It Wonderful</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff102/index.html">Final Fantasy 10-2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hwingwhit.html">Heath Wingwhit</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It had started when Rikku extended a hand to Yuna. The former summoner 
had walked in on her and Paine and had been at a loss for words, a 
healthy blush coloring her cheeks as she saw her two friends in such an 
intimate position. While it was true that they weren&#39;t disrobed, their 
hands had been busy, their mouths teasing the other in open mouthed 
kisses.

When they realized Yuna had strolled in, they pulled away from one 
another. It wasn&#39;t that Yuna didn&#39;t know about their relationship, she 
did. However, they tried to not show too much affection towards one 
another when they were in her vicinity. Since the defeat of Vegnagun and 
the failed attempt to find Tidus and bring him back, the newly turned 
twenty year olds&#39; eyes had remained sad and downcast, though she did her 
best to hide it.

Paine and Rikku discussed her often. Something they could do for her. 
For a long time they plotted, trying to think out every possible way 
that they could bring him back to her. After that they considered 
setting Yuna up with Gippal. They still remembered how he&#39;d made her 
blush at the bridge so long ago when they&#39;d first met. Ultimately, the 
plan was pointless. While Yuna respected and appreciated their efforts 
she simply wasn&#39;t ready for a relationship right now. Rikku sometimes 
wondered if she ever would be.

The consensus between her and Paine was that Yuna must be lonely. No 
matter how hard she pretended not to be, they could see that her 
thoughts weren&#39;t with them. Besides, she was so young and beautiful, 
toned, even. It was such a shame to let herself go to waste. Tidus was a 
great guy, but ultimately he was just a dream, wasn&#39;t he? Paine had said 
so and Rikku had gotten mad, saying she didn&#39;t understand; that there 
was no way she possibly could. Still, in the end, Paine was right.

They supposed that it didn&#39;t help that Yuna was Spira&#39;s biggest known 
celebrity. It was because Yuna was so kind. Everyone wanted to get to 
know her but sometimes it was hard to know who genuinely wanted to get 
to know Yuna or who wanted to meet the person who would undeniably go 
down as Spira&#39;s most influential figure. So she spent a lot of time on 
the Celsius and she spent too much time smiling for the sake of others. 
When would she ever smile for herself...? Had Tidus even touched her at 
all...?

So when Rikku and Paine had retreated to the cabin and they noticed that 
Yuna was there, seeming so out of place and weary, almost tired, it 
seemed to click. Or maybe it was an impulse action on Rikku&#39;s behalf. It 
certainly wasn&#39;t anything Rikku had ever brought up, nor had Paine. 
Still, that one gesture, stretching her hand out, fingers uncurling in a 
wave, before bring the tide back, beckoning forward.

Perhaps it was that Yuna misunderstood the signal and the meanings that 
could lay behind it. She stepped forward, one step that seemed to 
resound loudly, then two until she was over at their side. Rikku had 
grasped her hand, sitting her down gently in between Paine and herself 
on the bed.

Paine and she looked at one another for a few moments as an insecure 
Yuna sat in the middle of them, hands clasped in her lap, head bowed. 
When Rikku, still eyeing Paine pushed back strands of Yuna&#39;s rich, brown 
hair, placing her lips to her ear, Yuna gasped. &quot;Rikku!&quot; And she looked 
to the side of her, stunned. &quot;What are you doing...?&quot; For surely that 
wasn&#39;t something they did. Not together. Besides, what of Paine? Wasn&#39;t 
she sitting right next to them?

Rikku was always full of things to say and it was a rare occasion in 
which words weren&#39;t spilling out of her mouth. Regardless of this, she 
knew that this was one fight that would not be won with words. There was 
no argument, no matter how brilliant that would sway Yuna over.

When Yuna stood, so did Rikku, so did Paine. Rikku wrapped an arm around 
Yuna&#39;s slender waist, a hand cupping her face. She felt Yuna&#39;s cheeks 
burn like fire beneath her fingertips while she struggled, stammered for 
something to say. Yuna had never thought she would find herself in a 
position like this, and now that she was in the clutches of Rikku, with 
Paine almost seeming to stand guard behind her (this wasn&#39;t something 
she could see but merely feel) she didn&#39;t know what to do. She couldn&#39;t 
make the words come.

She was unresponsive when Rikku grazed her lips against her own. The Al 
Bhed wasn&#39;t necessarily bothered by Yuna standing there like a statue. 
She knew what inexperience read like and knew that it was no indication 
that Yuna was absolutely against this. She knew her better than anyone 
after all, didn&#39;t she? Lowering slightly, her lips found Yuna&#39;s neck and 
they lingered there as she felt a ripple course through her. Rikku 
smiled a bit, rising again as she pushed back more of the brown locks, 
kissing the corners of Yuna&#39;s face.

She reached out an arm past Yuna&#39;s shoulder, wrapping her fingers around 
Paine&#39;s neck, urging her closer, encouraging the actions she had 
initiated. Paine at first seemed hesitant before she lifted a gloved 
hand and pushed down the thin material of Yuna&#39;s shirt past her 
shoulder. Slowly she bowed her head until her lips brushed her pale 
skin.

There was a hitching of breath, as if awakening, as if breathing for the 
first time after being deprived of air for so many years. Rikku took her 
face in her hands, staring into her eyes, intently, concerned. &quot;Is this 
okay...?&quot; She questioned softly, not wanting to alarm her.

Yuna tried to find words once more and found that none came. She felt 
Paine&#39;s hand traveling lightly over her clothes while she deliberated. 
Rikku, feeling this was response enough, once again pressed her lips to 
Yuna&#39;s, her fingertips kneading the back of her neck. This time she 
didn&#39;t pull away and she felt a trill pass through her, jolting her as 
Yuna&#39;s lips parted and their tongues mingled lightly for the first time.

Behind Yuna, Paine brushed aside the light hair that fell over her neck 
and traced kisses along the soft skin there. Her heart raced at the 
illicit nature of the activity that was unfolding before her. It was 
even more shocking that she was involved. Had anyone told her a while 
back that she would become involved in a sexual fashion with her sphere 
hunting partners she might have laughed and possibly decked them but 
now... Rikku had started it and she supposed she was along for the ride. 
As long as it didn&#39;t bother Rikku and if it... helped Yuna feel...

She pushed the thoughts out of her mind, moving more automatically now. 
There was a taste to her skin that was different from Rikku&#39;s. It wasn&#39;t 
identifiable, it was silken and as her lips moved along her ear, teeth 
nipping lightly it occurred to her that she was doing this to the 
summoner that defeated Sin. It made her flush.

It didn&#39;t compare to the heat that resided on Yuna&#39;s cheeks, however. 
She wouldn&#39;t have ever thought she&#39;d be in a position like this. It 
was...well. Who knew what Wakka and Lulu might say? Even so she couldn&#39;t 
help but elicit gasps. None of them she&#39;d intended to make; they&#39;d 
pushed through her lips quietly but abrupt. She felt Paine&#39;s hand 
creeping under her shirt, Rikku&#39;s hands rising along her stomach, up 
higher, cupping her as she tried to stifle any noise. It was hard when 
there were so many touches and lips. The heat of Rikku&#39;s tongue as it 
scorched fire along her neck made her lightheaded and she wondered if 
with that one small, weak knee inducing notion, Rikku could feel how 
fast her heart beat.

When Rikku&#39;s hands touched on her hips, gripping her and turning her 
around; everything changed. For a moment she and Paine stared at each 
other like frightened animals. Rikku came to stand at their side, then. 
Gripping one of the red belt&#39;s on Paine&#39;s outfit she pulled her forward 
just slightly, claiming Paine&#39;s mouth in a primal, heated fashion, 
before she did the same to Yuna in a gentler way and then stepped back, 
prodding them kindly at each other.

It was Yuna&#39;s hand that rose first, cradling the nervous warrior&#39;s face 
before they both leaned forward, hesitantly and kissed. For a moment, 
Rikku watched and fought the urge to frown at their leisurely display. 
Frown vanquished, she stepped behind Yuna and wrapped her arms around 
her even as her lips lathered kisses on Yuna&#39;s shoulders and back. Soon 
Yuna and Paine were kissing intensely, releasing inhibitions now that 
they were this far in the game.

Rikku&#39;s hands lowered to the shorts that Yuna wore. She undid the button 
and stooped down to her knees as she slid them down slowly, planting 
kisses on Yuna&#39;s pale legs, undoing her boots and discarding them before 
rising unhurriedly, her hands dwelling on the inside of Yuna&#39;s thighs as 
Paine pulled the shirt from over Yuna&#39;s head. Rikku spotted a 
self-satisfied smirk on Paine&#39;s face and nearly laughed. So she was 
finally relaxing.

In truth this was all odd (though enjoyable) for her and when she found 
herself in the middle of Paine and Yuna, as their lips and hands took 
her, depriving her of clothes, and will and breath, Rikku tried to put a 
cap on the pleasure that was flooding through her. Paine might get the 
wrong idea otherwise. It didn&#39;t take long for Rikku to steal away 
Paine&#39;s clothes, throwing them to the side haphazardly.

Even then, though, neither made any rush to get to the bed. Rikku placed 
her hands to either side of Yuna, her nails digging lightly on her 
thighs, brushing inward as her lips claimed Yuna&#39;s neck again, before 
Yuna turned to her and they met each other. It was tentative and slow at 
first, gentle before it sped up, their lips beginning to suck greedily 
as tongues sliding against one another, escaping and darting along each 
others lips. Rikku tried to keep that wicked smile from her face but she 
couldn&#39;t help it, just like she couldn&#39;t help loving Yuna&#39;s expression, 
so satisfied and excited, shocked at herself, stunned at how below her 
Paine&#39;s hands that lay atop of Rikku&#39;s held on so steadily as she placed 
kisses along the inside of her thigh, going higher, tongue lighting in a 
way that made Yuna grateful to have Rikku behind her, keeping her stable 
as Paine continued a path of pleasure up along her stomach, her breasts 
until once again their mouths belonged to one another.

Eventually they got Yuna on the bed once again.

A grinning Rikku pulled her back, gently into her lap before leaning 
down to exchange vows and stories with lips and tongue alone. She was 
glad when Yuna shyly brought her closer as Rikku&#39;s hand wandered along 
her body, teasing her soft flesh, fingers tracing along her stomach, up 
higher around her breasts before her lips moved from Yuna&#39;s mouth and 
lower. Yuna bit her lip, breathing laboriously. Was this how Paine and 
Rikku made each other feel when they were together...? The two of them, 
working on her like this... her mind couldn&#39;t stop spinning as more 
sensations were beckoned from her.

Paine&#39;s hands refused to be idle as she stared at Yuna. She had liked 
the small sounds she&#39;d pried from her earlier and wanted to see what a 
more experienced and personal touch might do to the older girl. Rikku 
did the same, in a different manner, from a different angle and the two 
of them exchanged glances, if for a moment, a solitary smile as they 
worked to have euphoria overtake Yuna. For one night, to push those sad 
memories away, the lost hope and to have her, for some time at least, 
experience a physical manifestation of bliss. They did it all with their 
lips that sucked, tongues that dipped and lapped, fingers that probed 
gently before the wrist would be gripped, pushing further, moving 
against it. Nails and teeth pulled from Yuna sharp intakes of breath 
that would be squelched by the deepest kisses as lips sealed her mouth, 
keeping her silent and satisfied as she writhed beneath. They all 
remembered the taste of the ocean on their lips brought from their slick 
and damp bodies.

Yuna awoke later as if from a dream, her head feeling hazy, her body 
feeling light. Turning on her side she saw Rikku and Paine under the 
blankets, nearly draped over one another. A blush immediately assailed 
her and Yuna&#39;s eyes widened as she remembered everything that had 
transpired. Lifting the blanket timidly to confirm she saw that she was 
unclothed.

For some moments she sat on the bed feeling frozen while a heat 
enveloped her body. She put her palms to her face and tried to breathe. 
Well, certainly she&#39;d never expected this to happen. And now that 
everything was over she felt like an intruder.

Quietly she got out of the bed and found her clothing in the dark. 
Carefully and quietly she donned them once more but avoided climbing 
into her own bed. Descending the stairs she left the cabin and took the 
lift up to the deck. When the doors open, spilling the cool night air 
over her she embraced it and went out further, wrapping her arms around 
herself.

The sky was bright and it made Yuna think of the Zanarkand Ruins and 
their majestic view. Taking a seat on the cold deck she felt it 
absorbing the heat from her legs before she lay down and stared up at 
the sky. She could still feel their touch lingering on her body, the way 
their hands had moved, their mouths had sipped. The blush came back full 
force.

She squeezed her eyes shut, turning the dark blue sky into a blur before 
it disappeared completely. It wasn&#39;t that she was ashamed over what had 
happened. And she could never fault Rikku or Paine. In fact, she knew 
what they were trying to do, knew what they had done they had done for 
her. Had she not smiled hard enough or in a convincing enough manner? 
Had she been selfish to accept what Rikku and Paine had offered? Would 
it affect their relationship?

The hot tears spilled from the corners of her eyes and she didn&#39;t bother 
to wipe at them. It had felt so... it had been nice. Those sensations 
that had taken hold of her. It wasn&#39;t fair. Shouldn&#39;t it have been right 
that he be the one who do it? Only have felt good if he was the one...? 
She had searched so long for him, had lost him after defeating Sin and 
hadn&#39;t had him returned to her after Vegnagun had been vanquished.

What was it all for then? She&#39;d only wanted to be made to feel that way 
by Tidus. But Rikku and Paine had managed the same feat in his absence. 
Yuna didn&#39;t like the implications. It made her feel like a traitor, as 
if she&#39;d abandoned him, as if she&#39;d abandoned his memory and it wasn&#39;t 
true. It wasn&#39;t! She loved him still, she loved him more than 
anything...but she was so lonely... Yevon help her, she felt like a husk 
since he&#39;d left.

When was he going to return to her? Would he even want her then? Sitting 
up she drew her knees to her chest, wrapping her arms around her legs. 
Maybe nothing could help, maybe he would never return. She dropped her 
head and wept, biting her lip, stifling her cries as her body shook.
