<span name="storytext" id="storytext"> Rikku sulked as she was pushed out the  door and onto the deck of the Celsius, listening to the door hiss  closed behind her. Sighing and stretching her arms up above her head,  she settled her hands behind her neck and wandered towards the gull  perched upon the front of the red Al-bhed airship. Leaning over the  metal tail of the bird, she draped herself upon the ornament and let  her arms dangle at the sides as she watched the ocean move along in  front of the ship, far below. Yuna had kicked her out of the cabin  after she had asked the former summoner if there was anything she  wanted to do, apparently once to many times. It wasn’t Rikku’s  fault that she was bored out of her mind, it was Brother’s fault  for not finding anything interesting to do, no spheres to search for  since the last one, the so called ‘awesome’ sphere that got them  into hot water with New Yevon, since they had decided to give it to  the Youth League. It had been two weeks, and after the week and a  half point, Rikku had started to snap. Yuna seemed fine with just  sitting and doing things like reading, and Paine seemed to have an  amazing knack for avoiding the young thief and securing herself  somewhere the Al-bhed couldn’t find her. Rikku suspected that Paine  had set up in the tool closet of the engine room, or just in the  engine room itself, somewhere Rikku didn’t much like to go. It was  too loud, and Buddy was so paranoid about keeping the engine in  working order himself that whenever Rikku and her tinkering habits  got too close to it, he just seemed to sense it and show up to yell  at her. She was good with machina, no one doubted that, but she had  the tendency to fuss and tweak with something to the point where it  would, occasionally, not work, and Buddy didn’t want that to happen  to his ‘baby’. Rikku thought that getting those things tinkered  with working again was half the fun, and it was honestly rather rare  that something she was doing stopped working, but it was often enough  that the navigator didn’t want to take the chance.
<p>Rikku was much better with weaponry  than brute working machines. A small part of her was always mildly  uncomfortable with the fact that she could make a gun out of spare  parts, but never seemed able to get a wagon to run as well as some  others could, but she also supposed that was simply due to the  circumstances she had found herself in in the past; working with her  Father to defend Home, working with him and others to build machina  to protect the summoners, becoming one of Yuna’s guardians and  having to constantly fight, as well as repair and improve her  companions weaponry. It just came naturally. She smiled to herself,  remembering the look on Lulu’s face when she gave Yuna the pair of  guns for her birthday instead of something more ‘practical’. She  cheerfully would point it out to the black mage that Yuna used the  guns a whole lot more than she used the various cookware Lulu had  gotten her. Lulu would just make some noise about thinking more for  Yuna’s future and giving her something to start a home with, but  Rikku didn’t think like that, having been on the move with her  people since she was born, never staying in one Home for more than  five years, though she would admit that having someplace steady to  call your own was quite a wonderful thing, and loved each and every  place the Al-bhed had settled in for a while. But, being able to  defend yourself, that was important, and ever since Yuna had joined  the Gullwings, she had plenty of times where she was looking down the  barrels of her guns at some fiend.</p>
<p>The lithe thief slowly slid down from  the metal ornament to plop down onto the surface of the deck itself,  the metal warm under the shine of the sun, a welcome change from the  cold air flowing past. Laying back and folding her hands behind her  head, her vibrant green eyes trailed the clouds as they flew past,  occasionally spying a bird and following its flight with a steady  gaze. She furrowed her brow a little, wondering why Buddy was flying  so low, more sphere waves could be picked up at higher altitudes, but  she shrugged her shoulders and set the question out of her mind for  later. Yuna wasn’t going to unlock the deck door for at least two  hours, so she wouldn’t be able to ask him anyway. Sitting up and  pouting a bit, she glanced at a watch and sighed upon realizing that  only ten minutes had gone past since she was ‘exiled’ to the  deck. It was going to be a long two hours.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Yuna, where’s Rikku?” Paine  wandered up to the sleeping area of the cabin, glancing about before  settling her eyes on the girl stretched out on one of the beds.
<p>Yuna grinned. “On the deck. I locked  her out there for a while so I could have some peace and quiet.”</p>
<p>Paine smirked, a faint sound of  amusement escaping her as she glanced upwards. “You locked her on  the deck? Why didn’t I ever think of that?”</p>
<p>Yuna rolled over onto her stomach,  pulling her pillow over to prop herself up with below her chest,  setting her book in front of herself. “I’m family, I’m allowed  to do that to her now and then. I grew up with her visiting  sometimes, and walked across Spira with her two years ago.” The  gunners dual-colored eyes shone with amusement. “I love her dearly,  but sometimes I value the silence.” She gave Paine a look. “And  you hide yourself well enough that I get the most of her attention.”</p>
<p>The amused look never left Paine’s  eyes. It was too subtle for most to spy, but Yuna had a knack for  feeling others emotions, and she had been around Paine for a while  now that she had begun to pick up the small things. “You can get  earplugs and join me in the engine room. Buddy seems to have managed  to set up some sort of anti-Rikku field down there, she hardly ever  ventures down.”</p>
<p>Yuna laughed softly and shook her head.  “No thanks. I honestly don’t mind it now and then, but I think  not having walls around her will help Rikku a bit. Why were you  looking for her anyway if you were hiding in the engine room?”</p>
<p>Paine gestured a bit as she walked over  to her bed, picking up her sword from next to it, checking the blade.  “I wanted to a bit of practice, and remembering that she was bored,  I thought she might want to spar for a bit. Fast little thief, she  keeps me on my toes.”</p>
<p>Yuna nodded. “She and Tidus would do  that, sometimes Khimari too, on the pilgrimage.”</p>
<p>Satisfied with the sharpness of the  blade, Paine hefted it up easily. “Care to join us then?”</p>
<p>“No, I think I’ll stay here and  relish the silence for a while yet.”</p>
<p>“Suit yourself. See you in a bit.”  Paine nodded to Yuna as she slipped down the steps and out, ignoring  Oaka as he asked if she wanted to buy anything. Why they had let the  shopkeeper aboard the Celsius was beyond her, his prices were  horrendous, but she supposed that the Al-bhed automatically helped  each other out no matter what. Not a bad thing, she thought. Entering  the elevator, she pressed the button for the deck and waited as the  machine moved.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Rikku spun about, slashing at the air  with her daggers as she moved across the deck in a quick and lethal  dance. She struck out at invisible foes, her mind filling in various  fiends that she would avoid or strike at known vulnerable places,  using her knowledge of how they attacked to plan how she would fight  them. Crouching for a moment in front of the door and facing the far  end of the bow, she considered how much better it felt to be using  daggers than to be using her earlier weapon from when she was on the  pilgrimage. While the claw had its advantages, in her mind, daggers  had more. Launching herself down the deck, she twisted and flipped as  she fought with the chimera in her mind, not hearing the door to the  deck open. Focused entirely on her motions, she didn’t notice the  dark clothed warrior leaning against the doorframe, watching.
<p>Paine was a bit surprised to find Rikku  practicing, she supposed the girl had gotten bored enough to settle  upon an idea similar to the reason Paine had come to the deck in the  first place. Setting the tip of her sword to the metal of the deck,  she tilted her head slightly as she watched the lithe thief move,  finding herself admiring more than just the ease of motion and  confidence Rikku had with her weapons. She was never certain why  Rikku wore the clothing she did, occasionally speculating it was  because of the climate she was raised in, but with the amount of  traveling to places that were occasionally quite cold, she thought  the Al-bhed would have something more…substantial, to wear now and  then. Not that Paine minded, she doubted anyone really did, Rikku had  quite the appealing figure, and her clothing accented it quite well.  The sunlight was especially nice to the warrior today, shining off of  Rikku’s hair as it flew about with her motions, highlighting the  faint sheen of sweat that appeared on her body. Paine shook her head  slightly, pushing those particular thoughts aside, uncomfortable that  she had let herself drift towards them.</p>
<p>Paine cleared her throat, hiding a  smile as she saw Rikku jump in surprise. She swung around, blinking  in the bright light of setting sun. A smile soon shone brightly on  Rikku's features, causing Paine to make a comparison between her and  the sun, only Rikku's smile was a different kind of dazzling. Twirling her daggers before putting them back on her belt,  Rikku walked towards Paine, wiping at her brow with the back of her  arm, her head tilted a bit. &quot;Paine! Did you come to free me?&quot;  She grinned as she came up even with the warrior.</p>
<p>Shaking her head and lifting her sword  up, Paine tilted her head towards it. &quot;I was wondering if you  wanted to spar for a bit? You seem to have had a similar idea.'</p>
<p>Rikku nodded and flexed a little bit,  stretching her arms. &quot;Yeah, though it was really more like me  being really bored up here. Though if you give me a few moments to  recover, I'd be happy to for a little. It's been a while since we  have, hasnt it?&quot;</p>
<p>Paine moved out towards the center of  the deck, swinging her sword about a bit as she warmed up while  waiting for Rikku to cool down some. &quot;We've been fighting a lot  of fiends, I dont think the three of us have really needed that much  practice. But after sitting around for as long as we have, it doesnt  hurt.&quot;</p>
<p>Looking over her shoulder, she spied  Rikku looking at her out of the corner of her eye, smiling. The young  Al-bhed pulled her daggers from her belt again and moved over behind  Paine. &quot;Or did you really just want to watch me sweat?&quot;</p>
<p>Paine arched an eyebrow, and for a few  moments, Rikku almost wondered if Paine was blushing. She looked  about to vocalize it, but was cut off by the abrupt attack from the  dark warrior. Dancing off to the side, she avoided the swing of the  massive sword, clanging one of her daggers off of it for fun.  Twisting, she sliced upwards with the other dagger, meeting nothing  but air as Paine turned away from the strike. She grunted faintly as  the warrior elbowed her in the back, but instead of losing her  footing like Paine attempted, she used the momentum to flip herself  forward and around, swinging her arms up to block the downward strike  of Paine's sword with her daggers. Not having nearly the same  strength Paine has, she twisted out from below the sword, sweeping  her leg out to try to knock the warriors feet out from below her.  Paine jumped backwards, giving Rikku enough time to get back to her  feet and twist about. She crouched there, twirling her daggers as she  eyed Paine, the older girl doing likewise, swinging her sword back  into place in front of herself.</p>
<p>The staredown lasted for only a few  moments before Rikku dashed forward in a low crouching run. Stepping  back and raising her sword, Paine blinked in surprise as Rikku  suddenly turned her back to her, staying her swing, only to be having  to fall back to avoid the tip of one of the red daggers as it sliced  upwards, nicking the end of her chin. Occasional wounds during the  sparing matches was acceptable, as long as they werent deep, and by  the shine in Rikku's eye, she knew that the thief was proud of  herself for being able to contact. Paine couldn't let that one go  unanswered, and dropped down, kicking at the back of Rikku's legs,  catching the girl off guard much like Rikku had her. With a yelp, she  tumbled backwards, her daggers sliding away, and as the younger girl  fell down atop her, Paine surprisingly lost her grip on her sword.  Rikku turned and rolled away, grabbing her daggers and twisting to  face Paine, who had gotten a hold of her sword and was standing  again, wiping at the blood on her chin.</p>
<p>&quot;Getting tired?&quot; Paine asked,  covering the fact that she was breathing heavily herself as best as  she could.</p>
<p>Rikku's bandana was a darker shade of  blue as she sweated herself, but seemed quite with it yet, shaking  her head and grinning. &quot;No, why, are you?&quot;</p>
<p>The warrior was about to reply when the  ship lurched, sending her down to one knee and Rikku to her hands and  knees. &quot;Tyshed! Fryd dra ramm?&quot; <em>(Damnit! What the hell?)</em></p>
<p>&quot;I don't know. We seem to be  gaining altitude.&quot; Paine stayed on her knee as the airship began  to climb, as well as increasing its speed.</p>
<p>&quot;Buddy! What are you doing?&quot;  Rikku yelled to the intercom, getting only static as a response. She  started moving towards Paine, another lurch of the ship knocking her  to her back. Much to her horror, she began to slide as the airship  started going higher.</p>
<p>&quot;Rikku!&quot; Paine  dropped into  a slide, using her sword to give her a hold, ignoring the screech of  metal as the deck protested her grinding her sword into its surface.  The ship lurched again, sending Paine slamming into the alcove of the  door.</p>
<p>Seeing Paine use her sword to try to  slow her fall, Rikku attempted to dig her daggers into the deck, but  the smaller blades were unable to penetrate the metal, all it did was  give a teeth shattering shriek of protest. &quot;Paine! Oh Spira!&quot;  The ship sharply angled upwards, and one of Rikku's greatest fears  involving Brother's airship came true.</p>
<p>She fell from the deck. Everything had  been going so fast, but suddenly, it all seemed to be in slow motion.  Locking eyes with Paine, she realized it was almost more frightening  to see the look of terror in the warriors eyes, the first clear show  of emotion that she ever remembered seeing, then the horror of  falling, fast, towards the ocean below. Still holding her daggers,  she twisted in midair, knowing that slamming into the water on her  back would be a bad idea, positioning her body into a dive position,  hands and daggers poised to cut into the water first and make it  sting just a little less. At least, she hoped.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Yuna blinked as the ship lurched,  setting her book down. She felt it begin to angle upwards, and tilted  her head curiously. Another jerk of the ship and she moved to stand,  leaning over the railing and looking down to Barkeep looking as  baffled as she, and trying to save his glasses from breaking. A  piercing shriek of metal on metal caused Yuna to grimace and hold her  hands up to her ears, a second shriek piercing the air after a third  jerk of the ship, and she glanced towards the windows as the airship  angled up again.
<p>The next thing she saw made her blood  go cold, not even seeing Sin for the first time gave her such a  feeling inside. Rikku fell past the window, a look of complete terror  on the girls face, the expression cementing itself in Yuna's mind.  &quot;No, Rikku!&quot; She screamed, twisting around and leaping over  the railing, falling hard to the tilted floor of the cabin,  scrambling forward towards the emergency stairs at the side of the  elevator. Ripping up the panel, she slipped in, grasping the handles  at the sides of the ladder and sliding down, quickly getting to the  control center of the ship. Slamming open the emergency door, she was  greeted by chaos. Brother was laying at the foot of the stairs,  Shinra crouched next to him. Buddy had managed to prop himself up  against a railing, using a fire extinguisher on the main controls  where Brother usually sat. Yuna blinked, moving forward towards  Buddy.</p>
<p>&quot;Buddy!&quot; She stumbled a bit,  grabbing the back of Shinra's chair to steady herself.</p>
<p>&quot;Yuna! Get to my seat and get  control of the ship!&quot; Buddy shouted to her, not taking his eyes  off the fire.</p>
<p>Yuna nodded and scrambled forward,  dodging behind him and jumping up into his seat, grabbing the  controls. Buddy had given her a few lessons on how to fly the ship,  and she used what she knew to try to level the machine off. &quot;What  in Spira is going on!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know, Brother's controls  just exploded as he was getting into the seat and blew him back  there, started a fire and sending the controls all psycho!&quot;  Buddy managed to get the flames out just as Yuna found the brake and  leveled the ship off.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to go back to where we  were!&quot; Yuna sounded hysterical, and Buddy noticed the tears  streaming down the gunner's cheeks as he moved to his seat.</p>
<p>&quot;What? Why? We have to take care  of Brother and fix the ship.&quot; The navigator glanced over to  where the Al-bhed lay against the stairs, Shinra tending to him.</p>
<p>Paine slammed through the doors, the  raw, fierce emotion on the pale woman's face something none of them  had ever seen before as she swung her sword out in front of her,  looking ready to kill. Her crimson eyes quickly took in the state of  the room, and her eyes leveled on Buddy. &quot;Rikku. She fell from  the deck.&quot;</p>
<p>If he werent wearing the goggles,  people would have been able to see Buddy's eyes go wide. He gestured  wildly to Yuna, the gunner slipping out of the seat and letting him  sit down. &quot;Right, lets see if the engines are still okay, we  went about twenty miles.&quot; The airship shuddered, the engine  undamaged but the controls still shaky as Buddy grimaced, fighting to  turn the ship. Yuna moved back to Paine, the look in her eyes  desperate, though she was clearly a little unnerved by the fierce  expression on the warriors features.</p>
<p>&quot;Paine, what happened? When the  Celsius lurched like it did, I didnt know what was going on, then  I...oh Spira, I saw her fall!&quot; Yuna raised her fist to her  mouth, biting down on her knuckle. Paine began to pace, walking  forward to look at the burnt and now soggy seat where Brother had  been, then looking back to the lanky Al-bhed laying on the floor. She  shook her head slightly, then looked at Shinra.</p>
<p>&quot;Shinra, this was an accident,  right? Brother didn't do something stupid and have this happen?&quot;  Her voice was like cold venom, and the young boy shrank back a bit  from where he was pouring a potion into Brother's mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know. Brother said  something about the controls acting funny since when we stopped in  Kilika, and how they were really acting up today. He had opened the  control panel to see why they were sticking so much, but he hadn't  reached in before they exploded and blew him back. He wasn't even  touching the steering or the throttle.&quot; Shinra quickly  explained, for once not taking his usual 'Im just a kid' excuse.  Paine seemed to accept this, espically when Buddy voiced his  aggreement of the explination, and turned to face Yuna, her crimson  eyes meeting Yuna's dual colored orbs.</p>
<p>&quot;Lets get down to the engine room.  Once Buddy gets us back to where we were, we take the raft out. You  learned to swim, right?&quot; She didn't pause to wait for an answer  as she walked past Yuna, who was still on the verge of panic, but  followed.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Rikku taught me. I'm not as  good as she is, she's the best of any other Al-bhed that was ever on  a salvage crew!&quot; Remembering Rikku's ability as a swimmer seemed  to brighten Yuna, the girl clinging to that with all her might.</p>
<p>&quot;Good, because where we were,  there's nothing but a whole lot of ocean.&quot;</p>
