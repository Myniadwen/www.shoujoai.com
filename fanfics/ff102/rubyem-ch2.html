The previously expirenced slowing of  time seemed to reverse itself as Rikku twisted in the air, and as  soon as she got a good look at the fast approaching water, things  seemed to speed up. She closed her eyes as she hit, the shock of  hitting the cold ocean at the speed she was going rocketing through  her entire body, she unable to hold her form after slamming below the  surface and down a considerable depth that would have normally taken  her a minute or two of swimming. Letting herself go limp but keeping  her eyes closed, she felt herself slowly start to level off, and  braced herself for the second onrush of feelings. And it was a good  thing that she did. Just exactly how cold it was hit her then like a  punch, causing her to tense and arch a bit, her eyes flashing open to  be greeted with the dim blue light of the depths she had dived to.  She had hit the water a little oddly, her left wrist screaming in  pain and likely broken from the impact, and she noticed that she had  lost her grip on one of her daggers because of it. Thankfully she had  desgined them so that the handles were filled with a boyant  substance, mindful of nearly loosing a claw or two when in an under  water battle during the prilgramage, so the dagger would find its way  to the surface, hopefully to be found at some point. Her hair floated  into her vision and she realized that her bandana had been forced  down to around her neck, and she had lost the sleeve on her left arm.  Moving her arms a little, she was then hit with the painful knowledge  that not only was her left wrist broken, but it seemed that her arm  or shoulder was as well, the shoulder dislocated at the very least.  Slipping the dagger she still had into its place on her belt, she  tugged at her scarf, twisting it about as she floated there to turn  it into a makeshift sling of sorts to keep her injured arm close to  her body so it wouldnt flop about and get even worse. Once this was  taken care of, she felt the dizzyness from the entire ordeal strike  at her mind, and began to kick her legs to propel herself upwards.
<p>Gritting her teeth against the cold and  the pain in her arm, she shuddered while continuing to kick upwards.  All the factors tumbled together to make her progress through the  water slow, and she couldn't help but wonder if the water were  thicker here, even if she knew that to be silly. The light around her  got brighter and brighter as she swam, and finally, with a toss of  her head and a gasping sort of cry, she broke the surface, treading  water to keep there. To her dismay, she was quickly aware of the  silence aside from the waves, unable to hear the thrum of the  Celsius' engine.</p>
<p>&quot;Tyssed.&quot; She scanned the  surface of the water, trying not to twist herself around too much,  though she could easily position herself with the sun. Spying a  darker spot on the horizon, she fancied that it might be one of  Spira's multiple little uninhabited islands. She started to talk to  herself as she floated there.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, so, I fell off the Celsius,  which was behaving unnaturally. Brother's an idiot, but he's not that  much of an idiot, so something must have been wrong. Thankfully, the  ship can float, so if it stops working, it's not gonna sink.&quot;  She refused to think of what would happen if the airship landed  upside down, knowing that would make it go under. &quot;So I've got  about a fifty percent chance that they'll come back soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Rikku  looked down at her arm, and grimaced, quickly looking away. It was  broken alright, her entire upper arm bruised, and she could easily  tell where the bone was broken at an odd angle. She thanked the fayth  that it hadn't broken the skin, she didn't need to deal with an open  wound in the salt water too. At least the cold water was numbing the  pain somewhat, but at the same time, it was numbing <em>her</em> too. She knew that most certainly wasn't a good thing. &quot;I want  to wait, but what if they can't get back here? Oi.&quot; She let  herself float to her back and started to kick, directing herself with  her good arm. &quot;What if they don't...no, they'll come look. Paine  wouldn't let them do otherwise.&quot; She blinked faintly as she  realized that inside, she was positive that Paine would do so. If you  looked at their friendship, and how many times Paine would threaten  Rikku with pain for something or another, one might not think that  the warrior cared for the thief, but Rikku had always known that  Paine had emotions somewhere down in there, and she powerfully cared  for her and her cousin. Rikku smiled lightly, letting her thoughts  drift as she kicked towards what she hoped was the island, thinking  back to when she had first met Paine.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>&quot;Rikku!  Yna oui tuha tufh drana oad?&quot; (Are you done down there yet?) Brother's voice was shrill over  the communicator, and Rikku winced where she was currently dangling  from a ledge as she climbed up the side of the high walls around the  Calm Lands.</em>
<p><em>&quot;Keja  sa y sehida! Tysh.&quot; (Give me a minute! Damn.)  She strained upwards for the next handhold.  It only figured that the sphere would have to likely be imbedded in  the middle of the cliff face, making Rikku have to climb for it.  Hearing noises down below, she glanced down, and muttered another  curse as she saw some of Leblanc's goons down at the base of the  cliff. &quot;Great, and if I don't get this sphere first I'll never  hear the end of it.&quot; </em></p>
<p><em>The  three goons pointed up at Rikku, then gestured about wildly as they  talked. Finally, they took off, and Rikku half hoped they'd leave,  but no such luck. They were only going up the side path Rikku had  already tried, but were seemingly aiming for the top of the ledge.  &quot;Oh crap, they better not be trying from above!&quot; She  started moving faster, almost slipping twice in her haste. The goons  reached the top and stood around it, looking down at her, about fifty  yards up, and seemed to be arguing about if they should try to climb  down or not. Rikku smirked as she reached the orb while they argued,  and eyed her prize. It was pretty well wedged in where it was,  causing the thief to have to consider her options. Wedging herself  against another small ledge and holding on with one hand and her feet  hopefully on secure footholds, she reached for one of her daggers,  and started to try to pry the sphere loose without damaging it. </em></p>
<p><em>With  a victorious squeak from the blond Al-bhed, the sphere popped loose,  and to Rikku's simultaneous surprise, amusement, and embarrassment,  bounced off her collarbone and wedged itself inside of her bikini  top, between her breasts. &quot;Wellll, that's one place to store a  sphere...&quot; She mumbled to herself before glancing upwards to see  where the goons were. Blinking when she noticed that just the guy was  left there, she looked around for the other two femgoons, and spied  one down at the base of the cliff, and the third femgoon halfway down  the pathway. &quot;...stuck.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Come  on girlie! Give up that sphere!&quot; The male goon shouted down to  her, pointing with his rifle. </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Heck  no! This is mine, I found it fair and square, AND I climbed all the  way up here for it. If you want it, come and get it!&quot; She stuck  her tongue out at him, betting that he wasn't stupid enough to shoot  at her while his partner was down directly below. </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;KRACKPING!'  The sound of the shot ringing off the stone nearby quickly quelled  -that- ambitious overestimation of the goons intelligence, and Rikku  squeaked, nearly slipping. </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Rikku!  Fryd'c rybbahehk tufh drana?&quot; (What's happening down there?) Brother's tinny sounding voice  shrilled in Rikku's ear again.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Not  NOW Brother!&quot; She scrambled sideways, away from the goon on the  pathway, down below a secondary ledge that mostly blocked the male  goons sight. This left only the two femgoons, and one tossed a fire  spell at her, scorching the rock. Rikku silently thanked the fayth  that the goons had proven themselves to be bad shots in the past, and  weren't making an exception for that this time. &quot;Nice to see  that Leblanc is keeping up her ever so high standards in the creeps  she hires!&quot; She shouted, and the two femgoons flapped their arms  around. A teensy part of her mind thought that it might be a bad idea  to taunt the people throwing spells at her as she scrambled sideways  and down at a slight angle, but she couldn't stop herself.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;We're  the better sphere hunting group than you Gullwings are, and you know  it! That's the only reason you feel you have to yell such insults at  us!&quot; One of the femgoons sounded so...convinced...of that, and  Rikku laughed. </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Oh  yeah? Then how come the four of us have managed to find more spheres  than your entire Syndicate?&quot; Rikku dangled from one arm for a  moment, swinging back and forth until she got close enough to another  ledge to latch on with her other hand.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;You  stole the last three!&quot; The femgoon on the pathway threw a weak  ice spell at her, grazing her back, but Rikku was so warmed up from  the climbing that it honestly felt good instead of hurting.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;We  did not! I only take your gil!&quot; Rikku grinned, knowing that was  only partial truth. She took anything not pinned down, but these low  level goons rarely had a sphere, and she was never able to steal one  off of them. Any spheres lost by them to other hunters or stupidity  was likely always blamed on someone 'stealing', and who better to  blame than the all Al-bhed spherehunting group that was leaps and  bounds better than they?</em></p>
<p><em>Another  shot rang out from above, but again missed, apparently getting too  near to the goon on the ground, who yelled up at the one up above.  Rikku shook her head and moved as fast as she could, trying to take  advantage of the distraction. Unfortunately, moving faster meant she  wasn't quite paying enough attention to the stabilities of the rock,  and with a shout of surprise, lost her handholds and fell. She was  thankfully only about fifty feet off the ground at that point, but  landed with a oof and a loss of breath, wincing as she rolled to her  side and pushed herself up on her hands and knees. She saw the two  femgoons rushing towards her out of the corner of her eye, and  desperately tried to regain her breath so she could fight them off.  The two femgoons skidded to a stop within spellcasting range, and  Rikku was momentarily impressed with the fact that they were smart  enough to try to cast their spells together for maximum damage, but  dismayed that she was the target, and unable to summon her voice to  call for help from the Celsius. She closed her eyes, steeling herself  for the incoming spells and trying to draw a breath.</em></p>
<p><em>A  shout and cry from one goon and the feel of a partly aborted fire  spell made Rikku open her eyes and look to the two goons. One was  down and out of it, the other scrambled back to stand against the  rockwall. Standing over the fallen goon and eying the second goon was  a tall, dark clothed woman, a long and wicked looking sword held  leisurely in one hand. </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Now  now, three against one? That's not very nice.&quot; The woman's voice  was cool and confident, and Rikku felt an instant pang of attraction  towards the pale haired warrior, staring at the scene in front of her  even as her lungs were screaming at her for air. </em></p>
<p><em>The  femgoon launched an ice attack towards the woman, who easily dodged  it on her way as she rushed to strike the pink clad caster, knocking  her down and away like the first. The male goon made an appearance  now, but one look at the two fallen goons as he came around a corner  and he turned tail and ran. </em></p>
<p><em>Tears  were running down Rikku's face by this point in time and she turned  her gaze away from the woman, hanging her head and grimacing as she  finally managed to draw in a ragged breath, gritting her teeth  against the pain in her back from the likely busted or at the very  least bruised ribs. She breathed as deeply as she could aside from  the pain and eyed the sphere that dropped from her chest and into the  dirt in front of her, thinking of how this thing had better be worth  all of this trouble. </em></p>
<p><em>The  sound of footsteps drew Rikku's gaze up, and she met the eyes of the  warrior woman, who was now crouched next to her, and holding out a  potion. &quot;Here, drink this when you catch your breath.&quot; The  woman's relatively emotionless voice sent a small tremor through  Rikku, who eyed the warrior up and down for a moment. </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I  don't know if...if I should thank you..or..or be running.&quot; Rikku  managed to say, gingerly reaching out and taking the offered potion.</em></p>
<p><em>A  faint smirk rested on the woman's lips. &quot;You're right to not  know that. I could relatively easily take you our in your current  state. But why would I want to do that?&quot; She shrugged, shifting  to kneel and sit back a bit. &quot;It's up to you to trust me.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Rikku  quickly drank the potion, not taking her eyes from the woman. She  found herself drawn in a bit by the woman's red eyes and spiky pale  hair, it not something she was used to seeing. &quot;If I hadn't  fallen, I could have easily taken them down you know.&quot; </em></p>
<p><em>The  woman raised an eyebrow slightly. &quot;A child with a pop gun could  have taken them down.&quot;  She smirked a bit, and Rikku pushed  herself into a sitting position, palming the sphere as she did so and  discreetly slipping it into one of her pouches. She noticed the faint  look of surprise in the woman's eyes as she noticed that the sphere  was no longer there. </em></p>
<p><em>Rikku  sat, but it was in a position she could easily jump up from or get  away from a strike in. She was grateful for this woman's help, but  she still didn't know if she should be thanking her or running yet,  if the woman was really just after the sphere or not. &quot;Yeah, but  it's fun to fight them, they're so stupid at what they do. At least  sometimes one can get gil off of them.&quot; </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I  figured as much, but they weren't exactly honorable in their method  of attack.&quot; The woman ran one hand through her hair, and blew at  a floating seed as it went past her face. </em></p>
<p><em>Rikku  smiled at that. She wouldn't have attacked someone who just fell so  far and was out of breath, but not really out of any sort of sense of  honor more than it was just more fun to fight someone on their feet  when you were confident in your abilities. With fiends, that was a  different story, but with a person, it was just more enjoyable to not  take advantage of something like that unless the situation called for  it. Holding one hand out, she smiled one of her radiant smiles. &quot;I'm  Rikku, thanks for the help!&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>The  woman looked down at Rikku's hand, her eyebrow arching again at  Rikku's bright smile. She hesitated a moment, then reached forward  and shook the offered hand. &quot;You're welcome, Rikku.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;What,  I don't get a name?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Why  should you?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Well,  I'd like to know who I owe a favor too.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>The  warrior smiled faintly. &quot;Fair enough. I'm Paine.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Paine  huh? Nice name. What are you doing out here in the middle of  nowhere?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Paine  shrugged. &quot;Traveling.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Where?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Paine  eyed the blond in front of her. &quot;Nowhere in particular.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Why?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;You  ask a lot of questions, don't you?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Of  course.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Paine  sighed lightly. &quot;Well, truth be told, I was looking for you.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Me?&quot;  Rikku blinked, a little bit of wariness kicking in again, her mind  backtracking to try to think of if she had seen Paine before, and  stolen something from the woman who now wanted it back.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;You  are a member of the Gullwings, right? You're Guardian Rikku, aren't  you?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Momentarily  taken back by being recognized as one of Yuna's guardians, Rikku  smiled. &quot;Yep, I'm a Gullwing. I'd not be listening to my brother  and climbing stupidly high rock walls to pry a sphere out of a hole  just for fun afterall.&quot; She paused for a moment, considering  this as she deliberately left out any sort of acknowledgment about  her time as a Guardian. &quot;Well, maybe I would.&quot; Paine made a  strange sort of face out of the corner of her eye, and she found  herself liking the fact that she seemed to have the ability to disarm  this cool and collected woman.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Good.  I have the perfect way you can repay me for saving you today.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Repay  you? You're not getting the sphere! Oh no, not after all the crap  today!&quot; Rikku hopped to her feet and stepped back once, and  Paine chuckled lightly.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I  don't want the sphere, at least, I don't want to take it from you. I  want to see what's on it, and see what other sort of spheres you  have, and I've heard you have a lot of them. None of the other groups  have had anything that I wanted to see.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Rikku  found herself brimming with questions, like who told Paine about the  Gullwings, who she had talked to already, what sort of spheres the  scant few other groups who searched for them had, but only one came  to her tongue. &quot;Why?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Because.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Yes,  well, you and the rest of Spira want to see these. The Praetor of New  Yevon has let it be known that he's interested in buying spheres for  a common library, and so has the Maven of the Youth League.  Personally I'd rather sell to the Youth League, but, well, you can  wait till it's set up and we sell our spheres.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Paine  sighed again, and stood as well. &quot;I'd really rather not wait  that long. Is there something I could do that would convince you if  you don't want that to be how you repay me for my help?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Rikku  tilted her head slightly. No one had asked to see their spheres  before, not like this. She and her brother being a pair of packrats,  they actually still had all of the sphere's they found, which was a  relatively large number, and had fended off offers from the two  groups currently vying for power in Spira, not needing the gil bad  enough to get rid of their little pieces of history just yet. She  really, honestly, wasn't entirely certain as to why she, Brother,  Shinra and Buddy were out and running around the world like they  were, but imagined for her Brother at least, it was largely to get  out from under their father's gaze, and she was only too happy to  travel, not wanting to settle after saving the world from Sin a year  earlier. She furrowed her brow slightly, then, the idea struck her  like a lighting bolt.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;You  can join us!&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Paine  blinked. &quot;What?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;You  can join us! You can search for spheres with us, and that way you'll  be able to see what we found. You said it yourself, we have more than  any of the other groups out there, and there's a reason for that,  we're good. I'm good. Brother and Buddy and Shinra just fly the ship.  I'm the one who goes out and crawls all over the place for these  things. We're good, but I could certainly use the help of someone on  the ground when going after something. I'm really tired of having to  run away from the really large fiends. I can take care of most  myself, but, hey, it would be great to have a partner! And another  woman, god, I'm so tired of being around men all the time. What is it  with large amounts of Al-bhed men traveling around in like, packs?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Rikku  knew she was babbling, but she could also tell that Paine seemed to  be considering it. &quot;Come on Paine. Or would you rather go join  with those pink jumpsuit wearing goofs Leblanc employs and be  constantly beaten to the punch by me and the Gullwings?&quot; Rikku  smirked, looking towards the two femgoons who had gotten up and were  currently trying to sneak away without being noticed. Fishing in her  pouches for a moment, Rikku hauled back and tossed a grenade at them,  laughing as it exploded and they ran off screaming.</em></p>
<p><em>Paine  looked back and watched the two goons flee, and shook her head. &quot;I  would never wear pink.&quot; She emphasized 'never', then turned to  look at Rikku. &quot;A Gullwing, huh? Well, why not?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Great!&quot;  Rikku hopped from one foot to the other for a moment, then held out  her hand. &quot;Welcome to the group!&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Rikku?  Rikku! I am the leader! I am..&quot; Brother's voice was cut off as  Rikku clamped her hand down over the communicator, still holding her  other hand out to Paine.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Don't  mind him. He's easy to ignore.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Paine  looked doubtful for a moment, but then with a faint smirk, took  Rikku's hand and shook it firmly. &quot;Great. When do I start?&quot;</em></p>
<em>&quot;Right  now!&quot; Rikku giggled and handed the sphere to Paine. &quot;You  can claim this find. But next time its whichever one of us gets a  hold of it first. We'll start keeping track then!&quot; She laughed,  and waved to the airship as it cruised down into the valley of the  Calm Lands.</em>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<em>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
</em>Rikku drew herself from her memories as she felt herself  starting to slow, the cold and time spent seemingly endlessly kicking  wearing on her body. She floated upright and treaded water again,  looking about. She smiled as she found herself very near to what did  indeed prove itself to be an island, the sight renewing her  determination as she rolled onto her back again, and started kicking  yet again. The memory of Paine 'rescuing' her almost a year ago also  uplifted her hope that she'd be found soon, knowing that the warrior  and her cousin would search for her as soon as they could. Now all she  needed to do, was get herself to that island, get herself a fire, and  wait it out. It all seemed so simple to her in her tired state, and she  held tightly to her hope. It's what got her through Sin, and if she  could get through that, she could get through anything, and she was  damn stubborn too. Rikku let herself focus her thoughts on Paine,  smiling slightly against the pain and cold, feeling the familiar  tingling in her stomach every time she thought of her feelings for the  warrior. Furrowing her brow a bit, she nodded to herself, watching the  gulls fly about, they coming into view as she got closer to the island.  &quot;I've got to tell her somehow. I can't wait anymore. Things are getting  dangerous, and though I know we'll get through it, I'd never forgive  myself if I didn't tell her...&quot;
</p>
<p>She oofed softly as her back ran  aground, rolling to her right and dropping her hand to the sand below,  her knees sinking into the sand. Looking upwards, she eyed the wide  sandy beach, and the small cluster of trees on the circular, tiny  island. Starting to shiver as she got up out of the water, she  staggered to shore, falling twice to her knees. Forcing herself to  stand again, she gathered together a few small pieces of wood, sitting  down with her back to the trees. Closing her eyes, she continued to  shiver as she tried to focus, and after a great amount of strain and  concentration, she cast a small fireball to the wood, starting a bit of  flame growing, feeding it wood until she had a nice, bright fire. Just  in time as well, as she watched the sun sink below the waves. Scanning  the sky for the airship, she sighed, scooting a little closer to the  fire, and hunkered down to wait.</p>
