<p><em>&quot;You do this on a regular  basis?&quot; Paine asked a little breathlessly as she ran behind  Rikku, glancing over her shoulder at the very large and very angry  chimera that was chasing after them. It had oversouled, and when they  realized that their attacks weren't doing a thing, Rikku declared it  time to flee.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Oh, yes, of course Paine. I go  out each day with every intention of running for my life! Keeps me in  shape!&quot; Rikku didn't bother to look back at the fiend, her scarf  flowing behind her as she ran through the Thunderplains towards the  travel agency. Each strike of lightning nearby still made her flinch,  but after her little camping trip she was much calmer in this  particular area. Of course, that was on days that she wasn't being  chased by something that wanted to eat her head.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Oh, well, you could have  fooled me.&quot; Sarcasm, Rikku was quickly learning, was a standard  of speech for Paine. The warrior had only been with the Gullwings for  a week, and the two women were prodding a bit at each others  boundaries still, Rikku a fair bit more than Paine was.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Pah, we've only run from  three!&quot; Rikku skidded down a small incline, mud now coating the  side of her leg. She glanced over her shoulder to the dark clad, and  now slightly muddy as well warrior. &quot;A little running  never..Look out!&quot; </em></p>
<p><em>The chimera had managed to get  closer even as they ran fast, Rikku spying the monster readying to  strike. She turned and dove towards Paine, knocking the surprised  girl aside as the chimera's claw swiped where she used to be,  snagging on Rikku's scarf and dragging her back a bit. Paine growled  and swung her sword out, striking at the fiend's arm as Rikku  squirreled out of her scarf and out of the monsters reach. The  chimera roared as Paine's angry strike hit home enough that it pulled  back, giving them enough of a break to get near to the travel agency,  near enough that the angry fiend finally stopped it's chase as the  two ran into the building.</em></p>
<p><em>A young Al-bhed girl looked up in  surprise as the door slammed open and Rikku and Paine ran into the  inn. Rikku fell to her knees in front of the fire, hands on the  ground and head hanging as she panted to catch her breath. Paine came  to a stop next to her, bending over and resting her hands on her  knees, breathing heavily as well. </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Ah..alright, are you?&quot;  The innkeepers accent was thick and her Spiran still shaky as she  blushed in embarrassment. She was likely set out in the Thunder  plains by Rin precisely because of that, not many people came through  the area, even though the Al-bhed were jabbering about fixing the  lightening towers.</em></p>
<p><em>Rikku lifted her head and smiled  crookedly. &quot;Fiend, oac, fa'na veha, kud yfyo vnus ed.&quot;  (Fiend, yes, we're fine, got away from it.) </em></p>
<p><em>The girl smiled and nodded, and  flipped a few pages in a book. &quot;Room?&quot; She looked back and  forth between Rikku and Paine, blinking after a moment. Paine had to  smile lightly as she saw the light of recognition in the innkeepers  eyes, her smile growing a little more as she heard Rikku groan  lightly as she knew what was going to come next.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Kiynteyh Rikku!&quot;  (Guardian Rikku!) She hurried around the counter to help Rikku stand,  who tried vainly to wave off the 'help' as the girl started to  babble, Paine watching amused as it actually flustered the usually  hyperactively talkative thief.</em></p>
<p><em>Paine straightened up once her  breath was caught again, walking over to a chair and settling herself  in it, watching as the innkeeper talked Rikku into a figurative  corner, asking question after question about numerous things, many  focusing on the Pilgrimage to defeat Sin. Paine knew of Rikku's time  with Summoner Yuna, everyone in Spira knew of it, though a good  portion of the population liked to ignore both the fact that Yuna was  half Al-bhed, and that there was an Al-bhed guardian who aided in the  final defeat of Sin. The Al-bhed themselves, though, were quite proud  of these facts, Yuna and Rikku held in high regard among their  people. Add onto it that Rikku was the daughter of the Al-bhed's  tribal leader, and you got one of the higher held people in Spira.  Who, Paine discovered, didn't much like to talk about either of those  things.</em></p>
<p><em>She found it admirable. Initial  impression would make one think that Rikku would enjoy the attention,  and not be so humble about it, but Rikku insisted that she was only  doing what anyone else would. Of course, not just anyone would do the  things done, but Rikku didn't seem to consider that. From talking  with Buddy, Paine learned that where Brother was happy to let it be  known that he was the son of Cid, Rikku seemed to be determined to  make a name for herself outside of that, and Paine could see that she  also wanted to be known for something other than being a Guardian.  While the girl's humility over it was admirable on one level, Paine  was also a little confused, thinking that she'd want to be known for  such a world altering event. The fact that she was curious over it  all irritated her, though, and it was unlikely that Paine would ever  actually ask Rikku directly about it.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Alright, alright, we'll take a  room. Right Paine?&quot; Rikku's smile was a little forced as she  looked to the tall warrior for help.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;You get to pay for it this  time.&quot; Paine replied, stretching her arms out to the sides. </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Oh, no! No need gil!&quot; The  girl shook her head quickly, walking back behind the countertop and  getting a key, hurrying back to Rikku. &quot;Here, room down hallway  open, two bed.&quot; Rikku tried to object and give the girl the gil,  but no matter what she said, it was refused. Finally, likely to just  get away, Rikku agreed and grabbed Paine's wrist, hauling the girl up  and dragging her down the hall to the indicated room. Opening the  door, she almost shoved Paine in before entering and closing the door  behind her. Paine smirked, walking over and sitting on one of the  beds. </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;So insistent on getting me  into the room. I'll have you know I'm not that easy.&quot; She  continued to smirk, and Rikku rolled her eyes as she flopped over  onto the other bed. </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Ha ha. I'm so amused.&quot;  Rikku made a slight face, and Paine ignored the slight twinge the  rejection of the teasing sent into her.<br />
</em> </p>
<em>

</em>
</p>
<p>Paine  blinked out of the memory, shaking her head a little as the feeling  from the end of the memory drifted briefly through her. She reached  up and rubbed her hand against her eyes, murmuring lightly. &quot;Even  back then?&quot;</p>
<p>She  looked down at Rikku, frowning lightly as she noticed the pained look  on the Al-bhed's features, the heavier breathing of restless dreams  causing Rikku to jerk slightly now and then, the pain from her arm  likely causing the unsettledness. Paine suspected it was a motion  from her that had drawn her from her revery, and she reached up to  stroke her fingers softly through Rikku's bangs. Murmuring a soft  soothing nonsense sounds to Rikku as she reflected on the memory, she  mused, speaking softly to herself.</p>
<p>&quot;Well  if that's not a blatant reminder of past emotions, I don't know what  it was.&quot; Paine sighed softly, her eyes lifting to the stars. The  entire day had seriously unnerved her, and that was worrisome enough  without past emotions clouding the issue. She had trained herself to  press her emotions to the background, they too often interrupted or  got in the way when clear thinking was in order. With a light grunt  of irritation, she realized that she had run into her old nemesis:  the fact that when it came to situations like this, she needed to  both be clear minded, and let her emotions come in as well. Paine  loathed getting herself into this sort of mess.</p>
<p>&quot;But  is it such a mess?&quot; She looked down at Rikku again, her ruby  colored eyes shining in the dim firelight. &quot;Dangerous to fall  for a teammate, but at the same time...some of the best partnerships  can be formed that way. And we do fight well together.&quot; The  memory caused her to smile while thinking of that statement. &quot;At  least, when we're not running from an oversouled fiend.&quot;</p>
<p>Paine  looked over at Yuna, the gunner sprawled out on her back and snoring  lightly. Yuna had added an entirely new dimension to the fights with  fiends, and while her skills were appreciated, Paine had initially  felt that the addition of the girl to their group was more of a  disruption than anything. She and Rikku had a year and a half of  experience together, and she thought they did well enough alone. The  fact that Rikku had been one of Yuna's Guardians, and thusly knew her  cousin's fighting style, despite Yuna never having used guns before,  helped them find a way to work together. It also helped that she and  Rikku had the 'joy' of convincing Yuna to actually use the guns and  stop being such a pacifist, teaching her to use them let them tailor  the ex-summoner's skills to work with them best.</p>
<p>It  also irritated Paine that Yuna was just so good at getting under her  skin in a way that she couldn't snap at her for. Rikku had a knack  for asking questions in the way that left it open for Paine to  retaliate with 'respect points'. It was a playful teasing at this  point, and Paine realized that she mostly did it for Rikku's  reaction, which she found rather cute, despite acting as if it was  annoying. Paine now understood why Gippal insisted on continuing to  call her 'Cid's girl', even if the Machine Faction leader was an  arrogant twit and she wanted to beat him every time he got Rikku  riled up, at least lately.</p>
<p>&quot;Damn,  I've been crazy for you for quite a while now, huh?&quot; Paine let  herself smile as her mind pulled up time after time that showed her  feelings. Everything from wanting to kill Gippal to the slight  murderous rages that she would go into if a fiend managed to strike  Rikku. Most obvious of them all, the issues of today and the fear  that it brought up. That fear was more than just the fear of losing a  teammate, that was the fear of losing someone so important, that if  they were gone, one's life would never be the same.</p>
Glancing  over to Yuna to make sure the girl was still asleep, Paine leaned her  head down, and lightly brushed her lips over Rikku's forehead,  murmuring lightly. &quot;I think you stole my heart, little thief.&quot;
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><em>&quot;Oh Spira, oh fayth, oh  Spira...&quot; Rikku ran as fast as she could through the dark cave,  crying out lightly when she tripped and scraped a layer of skin off  of her arm. &quot;Brother! Can you hear me!&quot; </em></p>
<p><em>No response came from the Celsius,  Rikku to far underground for the communicators to properly work.  &quot;Tyssed!&quot; (Dammit!) She tripped again, just barely managing  to keep herself from plummeting over the edge of a very large  crevice. As she paused to regain her balance, she heard the roar of a  fiend echo off the rock walls, the sound coming from somewhere in  front of her. The sound of steel against stone was heard immediately  after, and Rikku spurred herself back into motion. </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Fayth preserve you Paine, if  you get yourself eaten down here I swear that I'm actually going to  go to the Farplane to bitch you out. And that's saying a lot from  me!&quot; A teensy part of Rikku's ever active mind felt a twinge of  guilt in how she hadn't visited the Farplane since about a month  after Sin was destroyed. Sure, the Al-bhed didn't really believe that  the figures the pyre flies showed were actually the person who passed  on, but after finding out more about the Unsent, and having a bit of  a heartbreaking crush on one, Rikku tried to go, to see Auron, and  talk to him. She knew that Yuna had visited almost monthly, trying to  summon an image of Tidus, but never successfully, only managing to  call forth her father, and by reports from Lulu, the monk as well.  Rikku had found after that first time that she went, that she never  really could bring herself to face those memories again, the pain  from losing him still fresh in her heart, despite remembering his  rejection of her feelings when she had worked up the courage to tell  him.</em></p>
<p><em>A greater part of Rikku's mind  reminded her of why that pain was fading though, and the irony of  Paine's name wasn't lost on the girl. It was nearing the year mark  since Paine had joined the Gullwings, and Rikku had come to the  conclusion that she had developed feelings for the dark warrior,  things she thought she'd never feel again after everything with  Auron. She was also currently deathly afraid of losing Paine down in  this cave, the thought once again kicking greater speed to her  flight.</em></p>
<p><em>The sounds of battle got louder as  she approached, and skidding around a corner, Rikku entered into a  large cavern, lit by several fires burning in some unidentifiable  fluid near the walls. A positively immense drake stood in the center  of the cave, one of it's forepaws laying cut off on the floor, blood  covering half of the cavern's base. Paine stood on the far side of  the cave, wielding her formidable sword in one hand, her off arm  hanging uselessly at her side. She was coated in blood, hers or the  fiends, it wasn't really clear. The fiend seemed to be weakening as  blood flowed from it's leg, but at the same time, so was Paine. It  took every ounce of self-control for Rikku to keep from screaming at  the sight, not wanting to distract Paine but not the fiend. </em></p>
<p><em>Rikku felt a rage building in her  that she hadn't felt since facing Sin, only this time there was no  fear getting in the way. Anger boiled to the surface, abject hatred  for the fiend clouding her mind of most rational thought. She could  feel it burning inside of her, her knuckles turning white as she  gripped the handles of her daggers with such force that she would  later discover that she had slightly dented the metal. The fiend  struck out with it's head, striking Paine in the side and throwing  the warrior against the far wall near one of the pools of flame, the  older woman sliding down to the ground without a sound, eyes closed. </em></p>
<p><em>A scream echoed through the cave,  confusing the fiend as it looked down at it's unmoving foe. Rikku  charged into the room, leaping up upon the fiend's back, her daggers  driving down into it's shoulders with two satisfying 'thunk's. The  next scream came from the drake, the monster tossing it's head and  bucking about to try to dislodge the creature on it's back. Rikku  held tight to her daggers, she had angled them in to prevent from  being easily removed, her legs clamped around it's sides. The fiend  slipped in it's own blood, falling down onto it's chest, Rikku  pulling her daggers from it and slashing them across the back of it's  neck. It managed to toss her from it's shoulders and she tumbled  easily back to her feet, landing in front of Paine, not seeing that  the warrior's eyes were open again. </em></p>
<p><em>The drake stood on it's bloody  stump, letting it strike out awkwardly with it's good arm, claws  hissing through the air. Rikku easily dodged, dancing to the side and  slicing upwards with both daggers. A roar of pain was her reward as  she severed a tendon, two of it's toes curling uselessly. It's huge  head struck downwards, jaws agape as it tried to bite the small  thief. Rikku slid below it's neck, the tip of her dagger digging into  it's neck just above the collarbone, a snap and a roar showing that  she managed to break bone. Her chest was coated in the fiend's blood,  the red rage in her mind now red vision as well as some got into her  eyes, drawing a string of curses from the Al-bhed as it stung. She  refused to close her eyes, rolling out from below it as it tried to  crush her below it's weight. Slipping in the blood on the ground, she  cried out as it's claws dragged down her back, lurching forward and  feeling her own blood mingling with it's. A teeny part of her mind  hoped that it wasn't a poisonous fiend as she twisted around just in  time to see it's head coming down at her. Dodging to the side, she  brought both daggers up to bear, stabbing one squarely into the  beasts eye, the other striking down as it shrieked in pain, the sound  echoing through the cave and stabbing into Rikku's mind. Abruptly,  the sound was cut off, a dull, wet thud as the severed head fell to  the ground with something of a splat. The body stood for a moment,  teetering back and forth before it fell with a thundering crash onto  it's side, the soft hiss of pyreflies leaving the body following as  it dissolved. </em></p>
<p><em>Her shoulders heaving as she  struggled for breath, Rikku stood and watched the fiend fade away to  nothingness. &quot;Just once, I want a trophy from these fayth damned  things.&quot; She scowled, wiping ineffectually at her eyes with the  back of her hand, dropping her daggers to the floor of the cave with  dual clanks as the stinging pain rocketed through her head, causing  her to drop to her knees. &quot;Vilg, vilg, vilg.&quot; (Fuck, fuck,  fuck.)</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Rikku?&quot; Paine's voice was  shaky and weak, but to the thief, it was one of the most beautiful  sounds in all of Spira. </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Paine?&quot; Rikku opened her  eyes again, cursing as she found her vision cloudy. &quot;Are you  okay?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I've been worse, I'm...great  fayth, Rikku!&quot; Paine just clearly caught sight of the blood  soaked thief, a dark blurry shape detaching itself from the wall and  moving over to her, Paine having to somewhat crawl. &quot;What's  yours and what's the fiends?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Rikku shrugged a bit, hissing  lightly at the stinging that sent down her back. She had been in  worse pain in her life, but this, this was like a thousand small  superheated needles dragging over her skin and stabbing into her  eyes. &quot;I think most of it's from the drake. Can you stand?&quot;  Rikku stood, fumbling a little before finding her daggers, the motion  not lost on the warrior.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;No...you can't see well, can  you?&quot; Rikku felt Paine's hand lightly touch her thigh and she  turned towards it, reaching down and resting her hand over Paine's.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Just from the blood in my  eyes, once I wash them out I'll be fine.&quot; The cave went dark as  Rikku closed her eyes again, only a little flickering light from the  fires visible behind her closed lids. She crouched down next to  Paine. &quot;Here, put your arms over my shoulders, I'll carry you  out on my back.&quot; </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Can you..&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Yes.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Paine sighed lightly and wrapped her  arms about Rikku's neck, using what strength she had to help the  smaller girl stand. Rikku was half doubled over as she reached back,  hooking her arms behind Paine's legs and holding the warrior up.  &quot;I'll guide you.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Good, cause the other option  is me blindly stumbling through the cave and hitting things.&quot;  Rikku turned her head slightly so Paine could see the slight smirk,  which also let her see that Rikku was just barely covering the fact  that she was in pain, likely from something other than the blood in  her eyes. Paine leaned her head back a little and glanced down  between their bodies. The fiend's blood was darker red than Rikku's,  so she was quite easily able to tell that Rikku's back was coated  with her own, and spy the claw marks.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Rikku...&quot;</em></p>
<em>&quot;It doesn't hurt that much,  Paine. Heh...&quot; Rikku mimicked Paine's voice for a moment. &quot;I've  been worse.&quot; The ache in Rikku's heart slowly throbbed, soothed  by the knowledge that Paine was safe, thanks to her, and she started  the long, painful walk back to the Celsius.<br />
</em> <em>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
</em>
<p>A  soft touch against her forehead began to draw Rikku from her dreams,  the echoing terror and sense of fear from the memory of nearly losing  Paine to the drake that day slowly fading as consciousness returned.  &quot;...little thief.&quot; She became aware at the end of something  Paine said, furrowing her brow and shifting a little, gasping softly  as she disturbed her arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Buh?&quot;  She managed to say, her eyes opening to the dim light of the  approaching dawn. For the barest of moments she wondered if she saw  Paine blushing, deciding it was nothing more than the red light from  the rising sun.</p>
<p>&quot;Rikku...I'm  sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.&quot; Paine faintly stroked her  fingers along Rikku's good arm as the blond girl shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;No,  it's okay. Bad dream anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah...remember  that time about half a year ago when we had split up in those caves,  and that drake attacked you?&quot;</p>
<p>Paine  furrowed her brow for a moment, glancing up to the horizon as she  thought, before blinking lightly. &quot;The big poisonous one that  nearly made you go blind? Yeah, I remember...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,  the one that also nearly paralyzed you? Stupid pycdynt.&quot;  (bastard) Rikku reached up to hold Paine's hand in hers, her eyes  shining with a sudden clarity.  &quot;I was...I never told you how  scared I was of losing you that day.&quot;</p>
<p>This  time Paine did blush, the soft pink dusting over her cheeks. She  threaded her fingers with Rikku's, squeezing softly. &quot;If...if it  was anything like how I felt when we were out in the boat looking for  you, I think I can say that I understand the feeling.</p>
<p>The  silence that fell was heavy like the fog that developed in the cool  morning air, ruby lost amid emerald as the two looked to each other,  both seeking answers to the question they were too afraid to ask.  Nothing in her training had prepared Paine to help her find the right  words, while Auron's rejection sang loudly in Rikku's mind and  stirring up fears of forever altering their relationship for the  worse.</p>
<p>As  the sun rose over the horizon, casting it's warm rays over the sand,  both Paine and Rikku opened their mouths to speak at the same time.</p>
<p>&quot;Rikku,  I...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Paine,  I...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot;  Each paused, holding her breath while waiting for the other to  continue. Paine was lost in the swirls of Rikku's eyes, wondering if  that was the reason for them, while Rikku herself was entranced by  the shine of Paine's, thinking that no ruby ever stolen could compare  to the sight. Each was about to speak simultaneously, as these things  are wont to happen, when they were interrupted by a sharp scream that  caused them both to jump, Yuna leaping to her feet and stumbling back  towards the water, one hand over her mouth while she pointed towards  the center of the island with the other.</p>
<p>&quot;Great  fayth!&quot;</p>
