<h2>a <a href="../ff102/index.html">Final Fantasy 10-2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/crimsoneyed.html">Crimson_Eyed_Warrior</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Paine sat in the cabin of the Celsius at one of the tables thinking. 
Rikku stumbled upon her and sat down across from her. &quot;You feelin&#39; 
alright Paine? You kinda haven&#39;t been yourself lately.&quot; 

Paine looked up at Rikku and half smiled. &quot;I&#39;m fine Rikku just thinking 
that&#39;s all.&quot;

Rikku looked at the older girl and raised an eyebrow. &quot;Yunie is even 
worried about you. It&#39;s almost like you are board being a sphere 
hunter.&quot;

Paine looked at Rikku and sighed. &quot;I&#39;m not board with being a sphere 
hunter. It&#39;s just after opening the Den of Woe and fighting Yuna and 
then fighting Vegnagun, it&#39;s just made me think that&#39;s all. Look Rikku 
it&#39;s not you or any of the others I just need time to forget my past.&quot;

&quot;Forgetting your past in some ways is forgetting us you know.&quot; Yuna 
looked at Paine from the balcony.

Paine looked up at Yuna and smiled softly then hung her head. &quot;I don&#39;t 
mean the past we&#39;ve shared I mean the past before I met you guys. When I 
was their recorder, that&#39;s the past I want to forget. I want to forget 
watching all those men in the Crimson Squad kill each other. I want to 
forget getting shot by Nooj. I just want to forget all that.&quot;

Yuna walked down the stairs and put a hand on Paine&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Our 
past is part of who we are. To forget your past is to forget a part of 
yourself.&quot;

Paine looked up at Yuna and smiled. &quot;So much for Dr. P looks like its 
Dr. Y now.&quot;  

Rikku chuckled and spoke to Paine in Al-Bhed. &quot;Suna mega y pmeht 
cxiennem ev oy ycg sa.*&quot; Rikku laughed.

Paine chuckled and shook her head. &quot;Sayh pid dnia.*&quot;

Yuna glared at her friends. &quot;It&#39;s not fair speaking Al-Bhed you know I 
don&#39;t understand it.&quot;

Rikku smirked. &quot;Now you know why we&#39;re speaking it.&quot;

Paine shook her head. &quot;That&#39;s not very nice Rikku.&quot; 

*Rikku: more like a blind squirrel if ya ask me. 

*Paine: Mean but true

&quot;Thank you Paine.&quot; Yuna smiled and set a hand on the leather clad girls 
bare shoulder.

Paine smiled softly and crossed her arms across her chest. &quot;Don&#39;t 
mention it Yuna.&quot;

Yuna looked at her friend knowing why she was feeling so down she 
smiled. &quot;I don&#39;t want you to worry about what happened at Mushroom Rock, 
when we opened the Den of Woe it really wasn&#39;t your fault.&quot;

Paine looked over her shoulder at Yuna and smiled. &quot;Thanks really.&quot; 

Rikku smiled. &quot;I told ya Yunie wasn&#39;t mad at you. If she could forgive 
me, she sure could forgive you.&quot;

Paine looked at Yuna then at Rikku and smiled softly. She was about to 
speak when Brother came across the p.a. &quot;Gullwings...report to the 
bridge.&quot;

Yuna and Rikku ran towards the bridge. Paine sighed and stood up and 
walked to the elevator and went to the bridge. &quot;What now?&quot;

Buddy spoke quickly. &quot;We&#39;re getting sphere waves coming from Zanerkand. 
Which is odd because it was quiet there up till about 10 minutes ago?&quot;

&quot;Well let&#39;s go and check it out.&quot; Yuna nodded to Buddy.

Buddy nodded and they flew to Zanerkand. Once the girls were on the 
ground they encountered a feind that was almost invincible. They were 
all on their last legs when Yuna decided to use her white mage dress 
sphere to heal them. As she was changing the feind went to attack her. 
Rikku was no help she was powering up a black mage spell. Paine growled 
and stepped in front of Yuna taking the blow full force. All Yuna saw 
after she was changed was Paine fall to her knees. It all seemed like 
slow motion watching her friend fall. Yuna tried to yell her friends 
name but nothing came out. Paine fell to the ground with a soft moan and 
Yuna went back to being a gunner and her attack combined with one of 
Rikku&#39;s level three black magic spells finally killed the feind. Yuna 
knelt down and rolled Paine onto her back. &quot;Paine are you ok.&quot;

Paine moaned softly and opened her red eyes slowly half way and nodded. 
&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; Paine winced in pain as she stood up.

&quot;Maybe you should sit this one out Paine.&quot; Rikku&#39;s green eyes shimmered 
and shown with worry.

Paine looked at Rikku and spoke in Al-Bhed. &quot;E&#39;s ug naymmo Rikku, bmayca 
tuh&#39;d funno ypuid sa.*&quot;      

Rikku nodded. &quot;If you say so, but so you know I&#39;ll be watching you to 
make sure.&quot;

Paine smirked. &quot;Fair enough I suppose. Lets go get that sphere huh.&quot; 
Inside Paine concealed the fact that she had a few broken ribs. She hid 
her pain from her friends up until they retrieved the sphere. After 
fighting the boss feind that guarded the sphere Paine dropped her sword 
and fell to one knee.

Yuna retrieved the sphere and Rikku ran to Paine&#39;s side. &quot;Paine you are 
not ok you lied to me.&quot; Rikku looked at the silver haired girl and 
frowned. &quot;Oui yna cu cdippunh. E lyh&#39;d pameaja oui vuikrd rind. Cu ruf 
syho yna pnuga?*&quot;

&quot;Ypuid ceq E drehg.*&quot; Paine winced in pain again.

Yuna walked over to Paine&#39;s side and her and Rikku helped Paine to her 
feet and the three returned to the air ship. Once on board they took 
Paine right to the cabin and laid her down on one of the beds. Rikku 
smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll go tell Brother what&#39;s up you stay here with her ok.&quot; 
Rikku walked out of the cabin and headed towards the elevator to go to 
the bridge.

Yuna undid the &#39;X&#39; clasp that held Paine&#39;s leather top closed. Paine 
grabbed Yuna&#39;s wrist and shook her head no when she felt the leather 
around her black leather bra get loose. &quot;Its ok Paine really I promise I 
won&#39;t hurt you.&quot; Yuna moved the two pieces of studded leather to the 
side and saw a scar just below Paine&#39;s left breast. It just barely shown 
under the bra. Yuna frowned at the sight and now knew why Paine tried to 
stop her. Yuna sighed softy and wrapped Paine&#39;s ribs and smiled at the 
girl. &quot;There, now you stay in bed for a while ok, and don&#39;t worry I 
won&#39;t say anything about your scar.&quot;

Paine looked at Yuna and frowned slightly. &quot;Thank you Yuna.&quot;

Yuna nodded. &quot;Don&#39;t mention it Paine.&quot; Yuna looked at Paine and smiled 
softly. Her eyes wet with unshed tears. &quot;I owe you my life Paine thank 
you.&quot; Yuna leaned in slowly and kissed Paine tenderly.

Paine&#39;s eyes got wide from the kiss as she looked at Yuna. &quot;It was 
nothing really.&quot;

Rikku came back and saw Paine blush. &quot;Ok, what I miss?&quot;

*Paine: I&#39;m ok really Rikku, please don&#39;t worry about me.

*Rikku: You are so stubborn. I can&#39;t believe you fought hurt. So how 
many are broke?

*Paine: about six I think

Paine smiled at Rikku. &quot;Nothing Rikku just not used to having people who 
care around that&#39;s all.&quot;

Yuna smiled at the young Al-Bhed girl and nodded at Paine. &quot;Thank you 
again Paine I&#39;m forever in your debt.&quot; 

Paine&#39;s lips still tingled from Yuna&#39;s kiss and heart still pounded in 
her chest as she looked into the different colored eyes of her friend. 
&quot;Don&#39;t mention it.&quot; Paine tried to sit up but was held down on the bed 
by Yuna and Rikku. &quot;I&#39;m ok guys really. Besides I&#39;m gonna go get a drink 
if you care to join me.&quot; Yuna and Rikku smiled and walked down to the 
bar keep. &quot;I&#39;ll have a highball, what about you two?&quot; Yuna and Rikku 
ordered their drinks and sat down at a table with Paine. 

Yuna smiled. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to watch the sphere. Maybe it will tell me 
what happened to him.&quot; Yuna got a somber look on her face and sipped her 
drink.

&quot;Yunie...&quot;

Paine looked at Yuna and all of a sudden felt sad. &quot;Yuna...&quot; Paine 
forced a smile. &quot;You never know he just maybe on it.&quot;

Yuna forced a smile and looked at her two friends. &quot;Please don&#39;t be sad 
for me or worry about me I&#39;m fine really.&quot; Yuna nodded and smiled softly 
at her two friends. 

Rikku smiled softly at Yuna and then hit Paine upside the head and spoke 
to her in Al-Bhed. &quot;EV oui ajan bimm cusadrehk mega dryd ykyeh E&#39;mm gemm 
oui so camv!&quot;*
 
Paine blinked a few times and looked at Rikku. &quot;You have guts I&#39;ll give 
you that but don&#39;t ever do that again ok.&quot;

Rikku glared at Paine but her look soon softened. &quot;You really had me 
scared out there today. I&#39;ve never been there when a friend got hurt 
like you did. Granted I traveled with Yunie 2 years ago but no one ever 
got hurt like you did.&quot; Rikku frowned. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for doing that I&#39;m 
just mad at you for lying to me. How could you? We&#39;re your friends and 
we love you your just too damn stubborn to see it half the time.&quot; Rikku 
folded her arms across her chest and glared at Paine.

*Rikku: IF you ever pull something like that again I&#39;ll kill you myself!

Paine frowned and looked at Rikku. &quot;Sorry Rikku, I didn&#39;t want you guys 
to worry. I&#39;ve been in much worse condition believe me. I survived the 
Crimson Squad masaqure.&quot;

Yuna frowned as she listened to Paine. &quot;Its ok Paine but not telling us 
you were hurt only risked you getting hurt worse. I thought your form 
while fighting was a bit different.&quot;

Paine downed her drink and ordered another and looked at her friends. 
&quot;You guys really are something else you know.&quot; Paine sipped her drink 
and looked at Yuna and Rikku.

Rikku looked at Paine with wet eyes before throwing herself into her 
arms and crying softly. She kissed her neck softly and nuzzled her nose 
behind her ear and left her head on her shoulder breathing on her neck 
softly. Paine&#39;s eyes got wide in shock but her look soon softened and 
she set a hand on the small of Rikku&#39;s back. Paine moaned slightly and 
sat up and looked at Rikku. &quot;I didn&#39;t hurt you did I?&quot; Rikku looked at 
Paine with wet eyes.

Paine shook her head. &quot;No Rikku you didn&#39;t. Besides I have a high 
tolerance to pain so don&#39;t worry. Was just uncomfortable and sitting up 
like that hurt, so in a way I hurt myself.&quot;

Rikku saw Yuna out of the corner of her eye and blushed then quickly got 
out of Paine&#39;s lap. &quot;Don&#39;t you ever scare me like that again.&quot; Rikku sat 
back down and drank her drink quietly.

Paine looked at both of her friends and sighed softly. *Whats with them 
all of a sudden coming on to me?* Paine smiled softly. &quot;I can&#39;t believe 
I worried you guys this much. You act like I almost died or something.&quot;

&quot;When I saw you take that blow and fall right in front of me I honestly 
thought you had.&quot; Yuna frowned and looked at Paine.

Rikku nodded. &quot;You really did have us worried out there you know.&quot;

Buddy walked into the cabin. &quot;Hey Shinra is finally done analyzing that 
sphere you guys brought back if you&#39;re up to watching it.&quot;

Paine nodded. &quot;Yeah we&#39;ll be there in a minute.&quot; Paine watched as Buddy 
left and she looked at Yuna and Rikku. &quot;Ready when you are Yuna.&quot;

&quot;Lets finish our drinks first ok.&quot; Yuna smiled at her friends.

&quot;Hey Yunie you know we&#39;ll be there for you no matter whats on that 
sphere.&quot;

Paine nodded. &quot;Rikku&#39;s right for once. And if you do find him just say 
the word and I&#39;ll make sure he gets hurt.&quot;

Yuna chuckled. &quot;Trust me you won&#39;t have to hurt him if we find him I&#39;ll 
take care of that. Besides you still have Shinra to hurt.&quot;

Paine smirked. &quot;Oh yeah I forgot about him. Next time he says &#39;I&#39;m just 
a kid&#39; he&#39;s hurt.&quot;    

The girls finished their drinks and went to the bridge. Rikku smiled. 
&quot;Let&#39;s watch that sphere.&quot; Rikku bounced and stood along side Yuna as 
the sphere played.

Sphere: &#39;Lulu looked over at Rikku and Yuna and shook her head. &quot;You 
know falling in love with her would be a bad idea. We don&#39;t know if she 
will survive the final summoning.&quot; Tidus looked at Lulu and nodded. 
&quot;Yeah but maybe having something to fight for will make her fight 
harder......&quot; Tidus looked at Auron who was recording this and shook his 
head&#39; end sphere

A tear rolled down Yuna&#39;s cheek as Paine pulled her to her and held her 
as she cried. Rikku frowned and rubbed Yuna&#39;s back and then held her 
from behind. &quot;Its ok Yuna if this sphere exists so does he.&quot; Paine tried 
comforting her friend and received a funny look from Rikku. Paine smiled 
at Rikku and Rikku went back to comforting Yuna.

Yuna stopped crying after a lil while and pulled away from Paine. &quot;Thank 
you both of you but I need to be alone right now. I&#39;ll be up on the deck 
if you need me.&quot; Yuna smiled slightly and nodded before walking off. 

Rikku looked at Paine and they walked off to the cabin. &quot;I&#39;m sorry about 
earlier Paine really I don&#39;t know what came over me.&quot; 

Paine shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s ok Rikku. We&#39;ve all been alone too long.&quot; 

Rikku blushed. &quot;But I shouldn&#39;t have done that I know how you are about 
emotions and displaying them and all.&quot;

Paine chuckled. &quot;Yeah I know I&#39;m kinda cold when it comes to the 
emotions department. But being around you and Yuna I&#39;ve gotten better at 
showing them I guess.&quot;

Rikku smiled. &quot;Yeah you have you haven&#39;t been shying away from us when 
we show you affection.&quot;

Paine nodded. &quot;Yeah well with busted ribs I may shy away.&quot;

Rikku chuckled. &quot;Well if we surprise you then you won&#39;t be shying away.&quot; 
Rikku grinned evilly.

&quot;Is that so Rikku? When was the last time you were successful sneaking 
up on me?&quot;

Before Rikku could answer Yuna came running into the cabin. &quot;We&#39;re going 
to Besaide Island to see Lulu and Wakka and Vidina come on.&quot; Yuna was 
smiling and her different colored eyes shown with excitement.  

Rikku smiled. &quot;That&#39;s a great idea Yunie!&quot; Rikku danced around like she 
usually did when she was excited.

Paine chuckled. &quot;You seem just as excited as Yuna Rikku.&quot; 

Yuna smiled. &quot;Are you up for a small visit to Besaide Paine?&quot;

Paine nodded. &quot;Yea I&#39;m fine really you worry to much.&quot;

Rikku and Yuna nodded and the three girls got off the airship in 
Besaide. Yuna ran to the village and hugged her friends and old 
guardians. Paine looked at Rikku and raised an eyebrow. &quot;I hope I&#39;m not 
on the receiving end of one of those for a while.&quot;

Rikku smirked. &quot;Yea you and me both. Though you more now then me.&quot;

Paine raised an eyebrow and looked at Rikku. &quot;Yea I guess.&quot; Paine 
smirked and then walked towards Wakka and Lulu. Paine did her usual 
stand behind everyone and watch what was going on routine. She sighed 
and closed her eyes and hung her head.

Lulu had been watching Paine the whole time they were there. She smiled 
softly at Yuna. &quot;Would you like to hold him Yuna?&quot; Yuna smiled and 
nodded as Lulu handed Vidina to her. &quot;I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; Lulu walked 
over and stood in front of Paine. &quot;I have something that will help your 
ribs heal faster if you&#39;re interested.&quot;

Paine slowly opened her red eyes and looked at Lulu. &quot;Tell Yuna to stop 
worrying about me I&#39;m fine.&quot; Paine sighed in pain and closed her eyes 
again furrowing her brow slightly.

Lulu smiled. &quot;Yuna didn&#39;t tell me a thing about your ribs. You can&#39;t 
hide your pain from a master black mage.&quot;

Paine opened her red eyes again and looked into the red eyes of the 
black mage. &quot;Well then you stop worrying about me I&#39;m fine.&quot;

Lulu smiled softly. &quot;You definitely have what it takes to be a guardian 
you know. But put your pride aside please, and follow me to the hut and 
I&#39;ll give you that potion. When you wake up in the morning you&#39;ll be 
completely healed.&quot;

Paine looked at Lulu and nodded. &quot;If it&#39;ll make you happy fine let&#39;s 
go.&quot; The two walked to Lulu and Wakka&#39;s hut. 

After a little while Lulu returned to the group outside the temple and 
Yuna happily handed her Vidina back. &quot;Where&#39;s Paine?&quot; Yuna looked around 
with a worried look on her face. 

Lulu smiled. &quot;Calm down Yuna she&#39;s resting at the old crusaders tent. I 
gave her something for her ribs. She&#39;ll need to stay in bed the rest of 
today though. When she wakes up in the morning she&#39;ll be fully healed. 
I&#39;ve made arrangements for you two to stay with her so if you like it&#39;s 
up to you.&quot; Lulu smiled at her two friends softly.

Rikku smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll go check on her Yunie you stay here and visit with 
Wakka and Lulu.&quot; Rikku smiled and dashed off before Yuna could protest 
what was said. Rikku walked into the tent and saw Paine lying on her 
back on the very last bed in the back of the tent. &quot;Paine...&quot; the young 
Al-Bhed thief whispered as she saw Paine sprawled out on the bed.

Paine moaned softly and looked over at Rikku and smiled softly. 
&quot;Rikku...&quot; Paine&#39;s lips were dry as she spoke. 

Rikku smiled and sat down next to her. &quot;Don&#39;t talk, you need to rest.&quot; A 
soft moan escaped Paine&#39;s lips again and Rikku frowned. &quot;You&#39;re in a lot 
of pain huh.&quot;

Yuna and Lulu walked into the tent and Paine smiled weakly at Yuna. 
&quot;Yuna...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t talk just rest.&quot; Yuna smiled at Paine softly. &quot;Rikku we should go 
and let Paine get some sleep.&quot; 

Rikku nodded. &quot;Ok Yunie.&quot; Rikku followed Yuna and Lulu out of the tent 
casting one last worried glance upon her friend. *Bmayca pa ug Paine.* A 
single tear ran down Rikku&#39;s cheek as she tore her gaze away from Paine. 

Lulu smiled softly at Rikku. &quot;Don&#39;t cry Rikku she&#39;ll be ok. She&#39;ll wake 
up tomorrow and be back at 100% trust me.&quot; 

Rikku looked at Lulu and nodded. &quot;I trust you Lulu it&#39;s just hard ya 
know. Seeing her like that in all that pain. It&#39;s just not the Paine 
we&#39;re used to. We&#39;re used to her wanting to do the hurting not the one 
hurting.&quot; Yuna cracked a small smile and tried to muffle her giggling 
with her hand. &quot;What&#39;s so funny Yunie?&quot;

Yuna giggled again and then composed herself. &quot;Kinda puts a whole new 
spin on her name huh?&quot; Yuna giggled again slightly.

Lulu placed her finger&#39;s to her forehead causing a few long black braids 
to fall over her shoulder and shook her head slightly. &quot;Yuna, why am I 
not surprised you said something like that.&quot;

Rikku: Please be ok Paine

Yuna giggled again. &quot;Come on Lulu, Rikku you can&#39;t tell me that you 
don&#39;t see the joke in that? You of people should know I&#39;m not the same 
person I was 2 years ago. That little quiet na&iuml;ve innocent girl is no 
longer present. Granted I&#39;m a &#39;goodie, goodie&#39; as Rikku says it but I&#39;ve 
changed a lot.&quot;

Lulu smiled. &quot;You&#39;re right you have changed a lot in these last 2 years. 
But still she&#39;s your friend and she&#39;s actually in worse shape then she 
let on. You could at least wait till she&#39;s back to 100% before you start 
making jokes about her name. Though it does make one wonder how she got 
it.&quot;

Rikku chuckled. &quot;That&#39;s easy. Spend a day with her and you&#39;ll see. &#39;Can 
I hurt him&#39;, &#39;Your so hurt&#39; major anger management problems.&quot;

&quot;Now that&#39;s not nice ya. Poor girl is in there hurt and you&#39;re out here 
makin fun of her.&quot; Wakka folded his arms and looked at the three girls. 
&quot;I think you owe her an apology ya.&quot; 

Lulu smiled. &quot;You heard him.&quot;

&quot;Hey, hey, hey that went for you too Lu.&quot;

Lulu blushed and nodded. She then elbowed Yuna softly. &quot;Still getting me 
in trouble.&quot; 

Yuna shrugged. &quot;Some things never change. Wakka always goes big brother 
on me and well I guess he went husband on you.&quot; Yuna smiled widely at 
her friend. 

Rikku smirked and jumped on her cousin&#39;s back. &quot;So Lulu Paine will be 
fully healed by morning?&quot;

Yuna staggered slightly from the sudden force of Rikku jumping on her 
back. Lulu nodded. &quot;Yes Rikku she&#39;ll be completely healed by morning.&quot;

Wakka looked at the three girls annoyed. &quot;Go, go now ya.&quot;

Lulu blushed and nudged Yuna and Rikku towards the tent. &quot;We&#39;re going 
Wakka.&quot; The three girls walked into the tent and saw Paine wasn&#39;t lying 
in the bed any more. 

Yuna looked at Lulu and then at Rikku a look of worry on her face. 
&quot;Wh-where did she go? And how did she leave with out us seeing her? We 
have to go find her.&quot;

Rikku made a pouty face. &quot;Damn she is so stubborn. You don&#39;t think she 
heard us do you?&quot; Rikku looked at the others with a worried look.

Lulu shook her head. &quot;Not likely that potion should have knocked her 
out.&quot; Lulu placed a few fingers on her chin as she thought. &quot;You two go 
see if you can find her I&#39;ll look around the village and temple. You 
take the beach and surrounding areas.&quot;

&quot;Right!&quot; Yuna and Rikku spoke in unison as they ran from the tent and 
began to search for Paine.

Lulu noticed that the back flap of the tent was open and smiled softly. 
&quot;So that&#39;s how you got away without being noticed.&quot; Lulu walked out the 
back of the tent and saw Paine leaning on a tree. &quot;Sorry I forgot to 
tell you about that side effect.&quot;

Paine used the pillow case she brought out with her and wiped her mouth 
before turning around and looking at Lulu. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;ve 
been trying to lose weight anyways.&quot; Paine chuckled softly and when she 
neared Lulu the black mage put a hand around Paine&#39;s toned but slender 
waist and helped her back to bed. &quot;Where did everyone go?&quot;

&quot;They went looking for you. Unlike them I knew where you might be 
because I know what effects that potion has. And again I am sorry I 
forgot to tell you about them.&quot;

Paine nodded and sat back down on the edge of the bed she was laying on. 
&quot;It&#39;s ok actually please don&#39;t tell them you found me.&quot; Paine hung her 
head. &quot;I don&#39;t want them to see me like this. They are so used to me 
wanting to do the hurting not the one hurting.&quot; Paine looked up at Lulu 
and saw a smile playing at her lips. &quot;I can tell from the look on your 
face Rikku or Yuna told you that already. Kinda gives my name a whole 
new meaning.&quot; Paine sighed. &quot;I haven&#39;t been in this much pain since I 
was shot by Nooj.&quot;

Lulu nodded. &quot;Yes Rikku told me all that and as for the whole new spin 
on your name Yuna already made that joke. But seriously you need to rest 
if you expect that potion to work properly.&quot; Lulu laid Paine down on the 
bed and nodded slightly. &quot;You do realize that you&#39;ve made friends for 
life with those two and they would be lost if they lost you. Especially 
Yuna, well Rikku may have a small crush on you but Yuna looks at you as 
more then a friend. She told me that she kissed you and she&#39;s indebted 
to you for saving her life.&quot;

Paine blushed ever so softly and sighed before speaking softly. &quot;Yea 
well Yuna kissed me because she was caught up in her emotions. We all 
know who her heart belongs to. As for Rikku,&quot; Paine chuckled. &quot;It&#39;s 
pretty obvious she has a crush, but I don&#39;t want to think about this 
right now.&quot;  

Lulu smiled softly. &quot;Rest now we&#39;ll talk more in the morning.&quot; Lulu 
flipped a few lose braids back behind her shoulder and walked out of the 
tent.

***********************************************************

The next morning Paine opened her eyes slowly and looked around. She 
moaned softly as she starched. Her head spun and her ribs were still 
slightly sore. *100% my ass* Paine thought as she stood up. She looked 
in the two beds next to her and saw Yuna and Rikku asleep. A small smile 
played at Paine&#39;s lips as she looked at Yuna cuddling her extra pillow. 
Paine walked over and pulled the covers up more over Yuna and smiled 
softly as Yuna snuggled into the pillow. Paine looked over at Rikku and 
saw her on her stomach her blonde hair covering her face. Paine chuckled 
at the sight and walked over and picked the covers up off the floor and 
covered Rikku up. Paine walked to the opening of the tent and looked 
back at her friends and smiled softly before walking out of the tent. 
Lulu was walking towards the tent when Paine stepped out. 

Lulu smiled. &quot;Good morning, how do you feel?&quot;

&quot;A bit lightheaded and a tad sore in the ribs but other than that I feel 
ok.&quot;

The black mage nodded. &quot;The lightheadedness and soreness will pass in a 
few hours. Are Yuna and Rikku still asleep?&quot;

Paine nodded. &quot;Yea they are, why?&quot;

Lulu smiled. &quot;Looks like they get to eat breakfast with Wakka and Vidina 
then, come let&#39;s go get something to eat.&quot;

Paine and Lulu walked to the temple and went to the lower level and sat 
in the small caf&eacute; down there and talked while they waited for their 
food. 

&quot;So Paine how exactly did you meet Yuna?&quot;

Paine leaned back in her chair and looked at Lulu. &quot;I helped her and 
Rikku out with a pack of killer hounds with a few lupuses mixed in.&quot; 

Lulu shook her head. &quot;Yuna always did befriend the hero types.&quot;

Paine got a funny look on her face. &quot;Whats that supposed to mean?&quot;

&quot;Nothing really I meant nothing by it. I was simply saying Yuna has a 
habit of befriending people who bail her out of jams. That&#39;s how she met 
him you know.&quot; Paine looked at Lulu and then shook her head. &quot;What is 
it?&quot;

Paine shook her head again. &quot;Its nothing, just for a second there you 
reminded me of my mother is all.&quot;

Lulu cocked her head to the side causing a few black braids to flop over 
her shoulder. &quot;Oh how so?&quot;

Paine shook her head. &quot;Just how the tone of your voice never changed the 
whole time you said all that.&quot;

Lulu smiled softly and nodded. &quot;You have very sad eyes when you speak of 
your mother.&quot; 

Paine looked at Lulu. &quot;I lost both to Sin 2 years ago.&quot;

Lulu frowned. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Paine shook her head. &quot;Don&#39;t be, thanks to you and Yuna my mother has 
been avenged.&quot;  

A faint smile fell on the purple painted lips of the older woman and she 
spoke softly. &quot;Please don&#39;t mention it.&quot; Lulu looked at Paine and smiled 
ever so softly. 

Paine was about to say something when she felt a hand on either shoulder 
and lips on either side of her neck. &quot;You two really have to stop that. 
We all know its not me you want either of you so just stop huh.&quot; 

Yuna frowned and looked at Paine with hurt in her two different colored 
eyes. &quot;You can be so cold sometimes Paine.&quot;

Paine saw the look on Yuna&#39;s face and frowned. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Yuna.&quot; 

Rikku whapped Paine in the back of the head as she walked over and 
hugged her cousin. &quot;Don&#39;t be sad Yunie...&quot; Rikku drifted off and sighed 
heavily before dragging Yuna off to the side and speaking softly. &quot;You 
can&#39;t let Paine know I told you this...&quot; Yuna nodded. &quot;Do you swear 
Yunie cuz she&#39;ll kill me if she ever finds out I told you.&quot; Yuna smiled 
and nodded again. &quot;Ok well you see you&#39;re the one Paine opens up and 
talks to right?&quot; Yuna nodded slightly. &quot;Well I over heard her and Buddy 
one day sitting at the bar talking in Al Bhed and well to make a long 
story short she loves you Yunie...When she realized I was in the room 
and heard everything she told Buddy she swore me to secrecy by sword 
point and I&#39;m not kidding. I honestly thought she was gonna kill me. So 
please don&#39;t tell her I told you. Her cold responses are because she 
knows you&#39;re in love with him, and she doesn&#39;t think you&#39;ll ever want or 
return her love so she keeps it buried and comes off as cold so that you 
won&#39;t ever know how she feels.&quot;

Yuna looked at Rikku and then down at her feet. &quot;I see, so Paine is in 
love with me and you and Buddy knew and I&#39;ve been so blind to the 
fact...I&#39;ve probably hurt her so much these last 2 years looking for him 
and telling her how I felt about him...&quot; Yuna trailed off and looked 
over at Lulu and Paine but only saw Lulu. She walked over to the Black 
Mage stunned to see her looking dazed. &quot;Lulu whats wrong, and where did 
Paine go?&quot;

Lulu looked at Yuna and sighed. &quot;Gone...She muttered something in Al 
Bhed picked up her sword told me not to follow her or to tell you guys 
where she went.&quot; Lulu motioned with her head in the direction Paine had 
walked off in.

Yuna closed her eyes then opened them. &quot;We need to find her; we can&#39;t 
let her go off on her own. I&#39;ll...we&#39;ll miss her to much. And besides 
she too good a friend to lose.&quot;

&quot;Try the beach there&#39;s a ship leaving for Luca today. I don&#39;t know what 
stops are in between but if the boat already left head for Luca.&quot;   

Rikku and Yuna ran towards the beach as fast as they could hoping to 
stop their friend from leaving. They ran across the pier just as the 
boat was pulling away. Yuna looked dead at Paine and Paine hung her 
head. She ran to the edge of the ship and tossed something to Yuna. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry Yuna!&quot; Paine yelled to her friend and true love as the boat pulled 
away. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I hurt you...&quot; Paine whispered as she walked below and 
sat in her cabin.

Yuna held the sphere in her hands that Paine had tossed to her. She 
recognized it and a tear ran down her cheek. Yuna whispered softly. &quot;You 
are so stubborn Paine why didn&#39;t you just tell me...this sphere belongs 
to you and I will give it back to you.&quot; Yuna fell to her knees and 
yelled in frustration then turned to a quivering Rikku. &quot;We&#39;re going to 
Luca now.&quot; Yuna&#39;s face had a very serious look on it as her one blue eye 
and one green eye burned into Rikku&#39;s green Al-Bhed ones.

Rikku gulped. &quot;Sure Yunie whatever you say.&quot; Rikku radioed Brother and 
they were soon there to pick them up. 

Lulu tagged along swearing Wakka would be fine with the baby. &quot;Wakka 
knows better then to argue with a woman who has the elements at her 
finger tips.&quot; The purple painted lips of the black mage soon formed a 
sly smile.

Yuna locked herself in her cabin and watched the spear Paine tossed her. 
A tear ran down her cheek as she watched it. After she finished watching 
the spear she lay on her bed and cried softly. After a few hours they 
arrived in Luca. Lulu walked to Yuna&#39;s cabin and knocked on the door. 

Yuna spoke through her pillow. &quot;Go away please.&quot;

Lulu frowned. &quot;We&#39;ve arrived in Luca.&quot; Lulu then slowly walked away 
frowning. She looked back at Yuna&#39;s cabin door and sighed softly. &quot;You 
found evidence he existed and this whole time you had some one who loved 
you right next to you. Oh Yuna you really need to stop listing to your 
head and simply follow your heart for a change. You love them both but 
only one holds your heart.&quot;

Yuna walked out of her cabin and ran to the bridge and Rikku, Lulu and 
her all exited the ship and headed for the dock. Yuna saw Paine and took 
off in a dead run and threw herself into the older girls arms and cried. 
Paine closed her eyes and wrapped her arms around Yuna and held her 
tightly. Paine spoke softly her voice void of all emotion. &quot;Don&#39;t cry 
Yuna. Please don&#39;t cry.&quot;

Yuna buried her face in Paine&#39;s neck and cried softly speaking through 
heavy sobs. &quot;Promise me you won&#39;t leave me again.&quot; Paine remained silent 
and simply held Yuna. Yuna stood up straight and looked at Paine with 
wet eyes. &quot;Promise me Paine...&quot;

Paine looked at Yuna her own red eyes tearing up as she closed them. &quot;I 
can&#39;t Yuna...I refuse to make a promise I can&#39;t keep.&quot;

Yuna looked at Paine and spoke softly. &quot;Why can&#39;t you keep it Paine?&quot;

Paine released Yuna and tuned her back to her. &quot;Because when you find 
him I&#39;ll leave again. Yea heh I know I&#39;m being selfish, but he&#39;ll want 
me around about as much as I&#39;ll want him around.&quot; Paine closed her eyes 
and hung her head.

Yuna looked at Paine and spun her around and held her close. &quot;Why would 
I look for him when I have you right here with me right now.&quot;

Rikku looked at Lulu. &quot;What do you think she&#39;s telling her?&quot;

The mage smiled. &quot;Probably how she feels about her.&quot;

&quot;No way! You really think Yunie likes Paine like that? I mean I know 
Paine likes Yunie like that but come on. You really think Yunie likes 
Paine like that?&quot;

Lulu looked at the young thief and smiled. &quot;Anything is possible Rikku.&quot; 

Paine took a few steps back and looked at Yuna. &quot;Why did you say that?&quot; 
Paine sighed &quot;You&#39;ve been talkin to Rikku haven&#39;t you?&quot;

Before Paine could finish her thought Yuna pressed her lips to Paine&#39;s 
and followed suit with her reaction. At first Paine&#39;s eyes got wide but 
she soon closed her eyes and wrapped her arms around Yuna and held her 
tight and returned the kiss. When they broke for air Yuna smiled softly 
at Paine her face a bit flushed. &quot;No I haven&#39;t spoken to Rikku about 
you. Why should I?&quot;

Paine chuckled slightly and shook her head no. &quot;I&#39;d prefer you not talk 
to Rikku about me thank you.&quot;

Yuna chuckled. &quot;Aww why? Are you afraid of what secrets she might spill 
that you trusted her with?&quot;

Paine half smiled. &quot;Something like that yea.&quot; Paine rubbed the back of 
her neck and looked at Yuna.

&quot;Well unless I get an &#39;I promise&#39; from you, I&#39;m not letting you go.&quot;

Paine chuckled. &quot;Well that&#39;s just incentive not to say I promise isn&#39;t 
it?&quot; 

Yuna made a pouty face. &quot;If you truly do love me you&#39;ll promise.&quot;

Paine looked at Yuna. &quot;Now that&#39;s not fair.&quot;

&quot;Guess you truly don&#39;t love me then.&quot;

Paine&#39;s eyes got wide. &quot;That&#39;s not true I do la...cheater...ok fine I 
promise.&quot;

Yuna smiled. &quot;I know you do and yes I cheated.&quot;

Paine shook her head and spoke in Al Bhed to Yuna. &quot;Hud y tyo kuac po 
dryd e tuh&#39;d muja oui Yuna.&quot;*

Yuna looked at Paine and pouted. &quot;You know I can&#39;t speak Al Bhed.&quot;

Paine smiled. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it Yuna I&#39;ll tell you one day what I 
said but for now lets not worry about it. I&#39;ll teach you Al Bhed Yuna, 
that&#39;s a promise.&quot;

Yuna nodded. &quot;Fair enough, let&#39;s just go back to the air ship huh.&quot;

Paine nodded and the two girls walked over to Rikku and Lulu. Lulu 
simply smiled at Yuna and nodded. Rikku on the hand started picking on 
her friends. &quot;UUUUUUUUUr Yunie, Paine E&#39;s cu rybbo van oui dfu. Cu Yunie 
ec cra y kuut geccan?&quot;

Paine looked at Rikku and smirked before whispering summin in Yuna&#39;s 
ear. Yuna looked at Paine funny. &quot;Just tell her that Yuna.&quot;

Yuna shrugged and said what Paine told her to say. &quot;Fuimth&#39;d oui mega du 
ghuf Rikku?&quot;

Rikku blushed. &quot;I keep forgetting Paine knows Al Bhed and you don&#39;t.&quot; 
Rikku smiled. &quot;We&#39;ll teach you one day.&quot;

Yuna smiled. &quot;You&#39;ve been saying that for 2 years Rikku.&quot; Yuna giggled 
and held Paine around the waist and looked up at her. &quot;How are your ribs 
doing?&quot;

Paine half smiled. &quot;They&#39;re actually feeling ok. Whatever Lulu gave me 
helped.&quot;

Lulu smiled. &quot;Told you it would work. But we really should get back 
Wakka hasn&#39;t been alone with Vidina this long before.&quot; The 4 girls 
laughed and reboarded the air ship. 

Paine: Not a day goes by that I don&#39;t love you Yuna

Rikku: OOOOOOOOh Yunie, Paine I&#39;m so happy for you two. So Yunie is she 
a good kisser?  

Yuna: Wouldn&#39;t you like to know Rikku

Paine sat at a table in the cabin spinning her glass on the table 
replaying what happened in Luca. *was I dreaming? No I couldn&#39;t have 
been she really kissed me and said all that.* Her thinking was soon 
interrupted by soft lips on her neck. Paine closed her eyes and breathed 
in the smell of Yuna&#39;s perfume and smiled ever so softly. &quot;Hey Yuna.&quot;

Yuna smiled. &quot;Hey yourself Paine. Mind if I join you?&quot;

Paine smiled softly. &quot;Please do.&quot; Paine slid the chair across from her 
out with her foot and leaned back pulling the chair out next to her and 
smiled. 

Rikku came skipping into the cabin and plopped down in the chair across 
from Paine and Yuna smiled and sat down in the chair next Paine. &quot;So 
what&#39;s the scoop with you two? It&#39;s so totally the scoop of the century. 
They showed the footage of your kiss on the dock about ten times.&quot;

Paine blushed softly and rubbed the back of her neck. &quot;Hucao silr?&quot;*

Rikku stuck her tongue out at Paine. &quot;Meanie.&quot; Rikku made a pouty face 
and looked at Yuna. &quot;You&#39;ll tell me right Yunie?&quot;

Yuna smiled her two different colored eyes twinkled a little as she 
winked at her cousin. &quot;What&#39;s in it for me if I tell you?&quot; Yuna giggled 
softly.

Paine chuckled. &quot;You two are defenantly related.&quot; Paine smirked 
slightly. &quot;You really wanna know what &#39;the scoop is between us&#39; as you 
call it.&quot; Rikku nodded and Paine smirked again. &quot;Well can you keep a 
secret Rikku?&quot; Rikku nodded again and Paine motioned for Rikku to lean 
closer as she did. Paine smiled when Rikku leaned in. &quot;So can I.&quot; Paine 
chuckled and leaned back in her chair.

Rikku scowled at Paine and spoke in Al Bhed. &quot;Oui&#39;na cilr y sayhea! Oui 
kad cusa celg bmaycina dundinehk sa tuh&#39;d oui.&quot;*

Paine chuckled. &quot;No Rikku I don&#39;t honest. We really haven&#39;t discussed it 
yet.&quot;  

Paine: nosey much? 

Rikku: You&#39;re such a meanie! You get some sick pleasure torturing me 
don&#39;t you.

Yuna smiled softly. &quot;She&#39;s right Rikku we really haven&#39;t discussed it 
after we do you&#39;ll be first to know ok.&quot;

Rikku smiled. &quot;Ok Yunie. Hey do you guys mind if we stay a few days in 
Luca? There&#39;s this big Al Bhed festival and Gippal sorta asked me to 
stay with him and help him run his booth.&quot; Rikku giggled softly. &quot;It 
would be the prefect place to talk and have some time alone and win sum 
prizes. What do you say Yunie?&quot;

Yuna looked at Paine who simply shrugged. Yuna looked back at her cousin 
and smiled. &quot;Its fine Rikku we&#39;ll stay with you. I enjoy Luca and it 
would be the perfect time for Paine and I to talk about things.&quot;

***********************************************************

Yuna and Paine walked through the festival hand in hand. Paine smiled 
softly at Yuna and when they happened on Rikku&#39;s booth Yuna asked Paine 
to win her something. Paine smirked. &quot;Ok Rikku what do you have to do?&quot;

Rikku smiled. &quot;It&#39;s your kinda game Paine. All you gotta do is get three 
of the five throwing knives in a blue ring. Now if you get all five in a 
ring you&#39;ll get a pick of your prize. So how bout it?&quot;

Paine looked at Yuna and Yuna nodded. &quot;I say give me the knives.&quot;

Rikku smiled and giggled and handed Paine five throwing knives. &quot;Good 
luck Dr. P.&quot; Rikku giggled.

Paine shook her head. &quot;Stop that...&quot; Paine smirked and tossed the first 
knife hitting a blue ring. She tossed a 2nd hitting the same blue ring. 
The 3rd hitting the same blue ring. Yuna looked at Paine wide eyed as 
the 4th hit the same blue ring. Rikku gulped as the 5th and final knife 
hit the exact same blue ring. 

Gippal looked at Paine then at Rikku. &quot;Now that&#39;s a damn good shot. I 
don&#39;t think Cid could even do that.&quot;

Rikku looked at Paine. &quot;Remind me to never make you mad ok.&quot; Rikku 
danced about as she got excited. &quot;Since the prize is for Yunie she gets 
to pick it.&quot; 

Paine smiled ever so softly and looked at Yuna. &quot;What&#39;ll it be Yuna?&quot;

Yuna looked at all the prizes and smiled softly. &quot;How bout the stuffed 
moogle.&quot;

Rikku smiled. &quot;After we made you run around in a moogle suit fer about 2 
hours you still want the moogle Yunie?&quot;

Yuna smiled. &quot;Mmmhmm I like moogles they&#39;re cute. And besides I had to 
wear it.&quot;

Paine shook her head and chuckled. &quot;Drao syopa lida, pid drao&#39;na hud yc 
lida yc oui Yuna.&quot;* 

Yuna smiled and looked at Paine. &quot;You&#39;re just saying that because I&#39;m 
your boss.&quot;

Rikku laughed then looked at Yuna with wide eyes. &quot;You...You understood 
what Paine said?&quot;

&quot;Yea she&#39;s been teaching me Al Bhed today as we were walking around.&quot;

Rikku smirked. &quot;Bet she&#39;ll give you a private lesson later.&quot;

Paine blushed. &quot;Watch it Rikku.&quot;

Yuna blushed deeply. &quot;Rikku...&quot;

Rikku smiled. &quot;What?&quot;

Paine shook her head and looked at Rikku. &quot;You never cease to amaze me 
Rikku.&quot;

Yuna smiled softly and whispered something in Paine&#39;s ear causing the 
older girl to chuckle and nod her head. &quot;When you&#39;re ready for lunch jus 
look us up ok.&quot;

Rikku smiled. &quot;Yea ok Yunie. If Pops remembers to relive us on time 
we&#39;ll catch up to you two bout 3 ok.&quot; Rikku winked at Paine. &quot;That will 
so give you guys time for that private lesson.&quot;  

Paine: They maybe cute, but they&#39;re not as cute as you


Paine rubbed her forehead as Yuna pulled her off clutching her moogle 
plushy in one arm and Paine&#39;s arm in the other. Paine looked over at 
Yuna when she saw where the younger girl was dragging her. &quot;Yuna where 
are we going?&quot;

Yuna smiled. &quot;To get a room, if you&#39;re gonna win me prizes I need 
somewhere to keep them and sides you can give me that private lesson 
while we wait for Rikku.&quot;

Paine blushed slightly. &quot;Yuna, I don&#39;t think you quiet got what Rikku 
meant by private lesson.&quot;

Yuna smiled and walked up to the desk and got a room and motioned for 
Paine to follow her. Paine got a confused look on her face and followed 
her friend into the room. Yuna quietly locked the door and walked into 
the room setting her moogle in the chair. She walked over to Paine and 
draped her arms over her shoulders. &quot;I&#39;m not as na&iuml;ve as I pretend to be 
Paine I know exactly what Rikku meant by a private lesson.&quot; At that Yuna 
leaned up and kissed Paine deeply.  

Paine smiled to herself and kissed Yuna back. When they broke for air 
Paine looked down at Yuna and spoke softly. &quot;Are you sure this is what 
you want Yuna?&quot;

Yuna smiled softly and undid the decretive belt Paine wore on her hips 
and frowned slightly then draped it around Paine&#39;s neck and smirked and 
drug her over to the bed by the belt and then dropped it to the floor. 
Smiling softly she grabbed the skull in the center of Paine&#39;s waist and 
smirked as she realized that was the real belt. After dropping it to the 
floor Yuna pulled Paine&#39;s gloves off then undid the &#39;X&#39; clasp that held 
the two pieces of studded leather closed around her shoulders letting it 
fall to the floor revealing Paine&#39;s black leather bra. Undoing the two 
belts Paine had across her stomach and dropping them to the floor. 

Paine smiled and chucked at the confused look on Yuna&#39;s face. &quot;Whats the 
matter Yuna don&#39;t know how to get the rest off?&quot; Before she could answer 
Paine kissed along Yuna&#39;s neck softly lifting the hood up and sliding 
Yuna&#39;s shirt over her head. Keeping the kisses on Yuna&#39;s neck Paine 
undid her belt letting her chap fall to the floor. As Paine picked Yuna 
up Yuna wrapped her legs around Paine&#39;s waist. Paine smiled at the 
summoner and kissed her deeply as she laid the younger girl down on the 
bed and running her hand down Yuna&#39;s body and unbuttoning and unzipping 
her shorts and petting her softly through her white satin thong. Yuna 
gasped slightly and then moaned softly. Paine looked at Yuna her red 
eyes asking her unasked question. Yuna nodded and Paine smiled softly 
and slipped her hand inside Yuna&#39;s thong and pet her just long enough to 
get her fingers damp then slowly slipped two inside the younger girl. To 
Paine&#39;s surprise Yuna moaned softly and bucked her hips slightly. Paine 
kept a steady pace as she kissed down Yuna&#39;s neck and across her chest 
lazily circling her nipples and sucking on them softly. Yuna moaned 
loudly as Paine quickened her pace and she rocked her hips with Paine&#39;s 
pace. Yuna dug her nails into Paine&#39;s back as she arched it and yelled 
the leather clad warrior&#39;s name. Paine slowly stopped what she was doing 
and winked at Yuna sitting on the edge of the bed and licked her fingers 
clean.

Yuna sat up and crawled across the bed and pressed her body against 
Paine&#39;s back. Yuna smiled and draped her arms over Paine&#39;s shoulders and 
kissed up her neck. Her voice soft she spoke to Paine. &quot;Mmmm I really 
wish you would have told me how you felt but showing me was much more 
fun I bet.&quot; Yuna&#39;s stomach growled and she blushed slightly. &quot;Um let&#39;s 
go find Rikku and Gippal I&#39;m hungry.&quot;

Paine chuckled as her and Yuna got dressed. Paine was just slipping on 
her last glove when there was a soft knock on the door. &quot;I&#39;ll get the 
door Yuna.&quot; Paine kissed the younger girl softly. &quot;Now remember we 
didn&#39;t do anything especially if it&#39;s Rikku we&#39;ll let her blush and 
imagine ok.&quot;

Yuna smiled. &quot;Ok.&quot;

Paine walked to the door and unlocked it quietly and then opened it. 
&quot;Hey Rikku.&quot;

Rikku blushed. &quot;Hope we didn&#39;t interrupt anything.&quot;

Yuna smiled and walked over by Paine. &quot;Not a thing Rikku. Let&#39;s go eat 
though I&#39;m starving.&quot;

Paine just shook her head as they walked to the caf&eacute; and sat down at a 
table and ordered their food. Yuna sat next to Paine and smiled and 
cuddled her arm as they sat there and waited for their food and while 
they waited they talked softly. Paine smiled ever so softly and looked 
at Rikku. &quot;So Rikku when are you going to admit the REAL reason you 
wanted to stay in Luca?&quot;

Rikku blushed. &quot;What do you mean Paine?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not stupid Rikku. I&#39;m not blind either I see the way you look at 
Gippal, and I also know what you&#39;ve told me. So fess up.&quot; Paine smirked 
at the blush creeping up on Rikku&#39;s face. 

Rikku scowled at Paine. &quot;You can be really awful sometimes you know. 
Sides you know as well as I do you and Yunie had that private lesson.&quot;

Paine looked at Yuna and shrugged then looked back at Rikku. &quot;Did we 
Rikku? Yuna show her what I taught you during that private lesson.&quot;

Yuna smiled and spoke to Rikku in perfect Al Bhed. &quot;Paine dyikrd sa 
ahuikr uv dra myhkia frana e fuh&#39;d haat ed dnyhcmydat yho suna.&quot;

Rikku&#39;s eyes got wide. &quot;Paine what did you do to Yunie? Now we can&#39;t 
talk about her in Al Bhed she&#39;ll know what we&#39;re saying.&quot; Rikku giggled. 
&quot;Couldn&#39;t you have just had sex with her; Life would have been so much 
easier.&quot;

Yuna blushed. &quot;Rikku...that was um well that was just wrong.&quot;

Paine looked at Yuna blushing and smirked ever so slightly and looked at 
Rikku. &quot;Do you want me to hurt you?&quot;

Rikku shook her head violently. &quot;N-n-n-n-no that&#39;s ok Paine really, no 
need to hurt me.&quot;

A sly smirk formed on Paine&#39;s lips. &quot;Good wasn&#39;t really feeling up to it 
my ribs are a bit sore.&quot;

Yuna took Paine&#39;s hand in her&#39;s and interlaced their fingers and 
whispered in Paine&#39;s ear. &quot;Well they better not be sore later because I 
could go for round 2 of that private lesson.&quot; Paine looked at Yuna and 
shook her head and chuckled a little then nodded. 

*Yuna: Paine taught me enough of the langue where I won&#39;t need it 
translated any more. 

Yuna smiled up at Paine innocently and then winked and looked at Rikku. 
&quot;So Rikku you really would have preferred it if me and Paine had sex 
instead of her teaching me Al Bhed?&quot; 

Rikku nodded. &quot;Yea that would have been so much easier to deal with.&quot;

Paine raised an eyebrow. &quot;Well maybe we will tonight then Yuna can tell 
you all about it tomorrow.&quot;

Rikku blushed horribly. &quot;You know Paine that&#39;s really awful.&quot;

Yuna smiled her two different color eyes sparkling. &quot;Really Rikku? 
What&#39;s so awful? The thought of me sleeping with Paine or the thought of 
me telling you all about it afterwards?&quot;

Rikku looked at her cousin. &quot;Both honestly.&quot;

Yuna giggled. &quot;Well I swear I won&#39;t tell you about anything in the 
morning. If you wanna know that bad you can just ask Paine.&quot; 

Gippel smiled at the whole thing. &quot;As much as I would love to hear more 
of this we gotta get back to the booth before Cid gets grouchy, come on 
sexy lets go.&quot; 

Rikku blushed and nodded. &quot;Stop calling me that.&quot;

&quot;Stop being so shy Rikku its obvious to them we&#39;re an item so stop 
denying it.&quot;

Rikku sighed. &quot;Yea ok. See ya later Yunie. Paine you take care of her 
while I&#39;m away ok.&quot;

Paine nodded. &quot;You can count on me Rikku.&quot;

Yuna smiled and grabbed a hold of Paine&#39;s leather clad hand and pulled 
her to her feet and they walked around the fair more hand in hand. Yuna 
made Paine play game after game to win her prizes. Yuna growled when a 
reporter stopped them and started asking questions. Paine saw the look 
of annoyment of Yuna&#39;s face and took a few steps forward and picked the 
man up by the front of his shirt. &quot;You want a quote I&#39;ll give you a 
quote, bother her again and I&#39;ll hurt you very badly, so badly you&#39;d 
wish a feind attacked you got it.&quot; Paine growled and set the guy down 
and watched him run off.

Yuna&#39;s eyes were wide she knew Paine was strong but not that strong. 
&quot;Paine are you ok?&quot; Yuna looked at Paine a bit worried about her. Paine 
nodded and Yuna smiled. &quot;Good I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t hurt yourself. Thank 
you by the way he wasn&#39;t taking the hint that I wasn&#39;t going to talk to 
him.&quot;

Paine shook her head. &quot;It was nothing Yuna really he was pissing me off 
to so.&quot; Paine shrugged. &quot;So whats next on your &#39;Paine win me&#39; list?&quot;

Yuna smiled. &quot;All I want now is you Paine.&quot;

Rikku draped her arm over her cousin&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Well Yunie it&#39;ll have 
to wait lets get your stuff and head back to the airship huh.&quot;

Yuna blushed a bit. &quot;Ok we can go Paine&#39;s won me enough prizes for 
today.&quot; Yuna looked at Paine and winked slyly and walking over by her 
wrapping her in a hug speaking loud enough for only Paine to hear. 
&quot;Don&#39;t make me wait to long ok.&quot; Yuna stepped back and the four walked 
to the hotel and Yuna, Rikku, and Paine all held two plushies each as 
they walked to the air ship and boarded. Yuna smiled and skipped to her 
bed and set her moogle and cait skaith on her bed. &quot;Just put those on my 
bed ok you two.&quot;

Paine quirked an eyebrow. &quot;Yuna um that moogel takes up half your bed 
where are you going to sleep?&quot;

Rikku giggled and elbowed Paine playfully. &quot;With you where do you 
think?&quot; Rikku gave Paine a childish grin.

Paine sighed. &quot;25 Rikku.&quot;

&quot;Damn I had 50 yesterday. Is there a way I can earn them back?&quot; Rikku 
looked at Paine with pleading eyes.

Paine shrugged and dropped the Tonberry and Cactuar plushie on Yuna&#39;s 
bed and turned and looked at Rikku. &quot;You could earn them all back if you 
polish and sharpen my sword.&quot;

Rikku dropped the Elder Drake and Chocobo plushie on Yuna&#39;s bed and held 
her arms out. &quot;As big and heavy as that thing is I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

Paine chuckled and put her sword on her bed. &quot;The stuff is in the box 
under my bed have fun Rikku.&quot;

Rikku sighed and walked over to Paine&#39;s bed and pulled out the box and 
set it down on the bed and huffed as she sat down and started to sharpen 
Paine&#39;s sword. Rikku wiped the sweat from her brow as she wiped the last 
bit if dirt from the now sharp blade of the sword. Rikku grabbed the 
bottle of polish out of the box and quickly polished the blade and went 
and sat down at a table and sighed heavily. &quot;The things I do for respect 
points.&quot;

Paine and Yuna stood on the deck of the Celsius and talked about what 
happened the past few days. Paine spoke in her usual unemotional tone. 
&quot;I know I acted like a child earlier and I&#39;m sorry about that.&quot; Paine 
hung her head and looked at her boots and sighed.

Yuna walked over to the leather clad warrior and lifted her chin and 
shook her head and simply kissed her tenderly. &quot;Don&#39;t be Paine, if 
anyone should be sorry it should be me. All this time you&#39;ve loved me 
and I was too blind to see it I was so interested in Tidus and finding 
him that I probably broke your heart every time I spoke of him. Can you 
forgive me Paine?&quot;

Paine nodded and leaned in and kissed Yuna softly. &quot;There&#39;s nothing to 
forgive Yuna.&quot; Paine smiled a very rare smile and kissed Yuna again 
softly. &quot;Let&#39;s go see how Rikku is doing on my sword shall we.&quot;

Yuna chuckled. &quot;Yea let&#39;s go see if you killed her by making her work 
that hard. Knowing her she just stole you a new one.&quot;     

Paine chuckled. &quot;I&#39;ll know if she did.&quot;

The two walked back to the cabin and saw Rikku sitting at a table 
drinking what looked to be soda. Rikku smiled when she saw the two walk 
in. &quot;Well it&#39;s done Paine, and if you don&#39;t believe me I have the cuts 
to prove it.&quot; Rikku held up her cut hands.

Paine shook her head and motioned for Rikku to follow her. &quot;Sit.&quot; Paine 
pointed to the bar stool and walked behind the bar and pulled out a box 
of band-aides and walked out and stood in front of Rikku. &quot;Hold your 
hands out Rikku.&quot; Rikku shyly held out her hands and Paine shook her 
head and put a band-aide over each one of Rikku&#39;s cuts. &quot;There. How the 
hell do you sharpen your daggers and live through it Rikku?&quot;

&quot;Well now you know why we call you Dr. P, and my daggers aren&#39;t as big 
as your sword is, no where near as heavy for that matter.&quot;

Paine shook her head. &quot;Well let&#39;s go see how bloody my sword is.&quot;

Yuna giggled. &quot;That&#39;s not very nice you know.&quot;

Paine smirked. &quot;Neither was the fact you guys were cracking jokes at my 
name while on Besaide either so I say it was simply payback.&quot;

Rikku went to say something but didn&#39;t. &quot;You&#39;re right I do deserve 
that.&quot;

The three girls walked up the stairs and Paine picked up her sword and 
examined it. &quot;Nice job Rikku you&#39;re back to 50.&quot; Paine put her sword 
back in her sheath and tossed Rikku something. &quot;Here that should make 
your cuts feel better.&quot;

Rikku caught the object and looked at it and smiled seeing it was a 
large bag of her favorite candy. &quot;Thanks Paine how did you know it&#39;s my 
favorite candy?&quot;

Paine shrugged. &quot;You&#39;re always talking about it and I&#39;ve seen you make 
Brother make special stops in Luca so you could buy a bag, and seeings 
how we were in Luca and I was winning all kinds of stuff for Yuna I 
thought I would be nice and get you at least one thing. That should last 
you a few months.&quot;

Rikku smiled. &quot;If you weren&#39;t dating my cousin I&#39;d kiss you. Thanks so 
much Paine.&quot;

&quot;Hey thank Yuna I was gonna get you a small bag, but Yuna told me to buy 
you that one.&quot;

Rikku pounced her cousin causing Yuna to fall to Paine&#39;s bed with Rikku 
sitting on her waist. &quot;Thank you Yunie.&quot;

Paine quirked an eyebrow then shrugged. Yuna blushed a deep crimson. &quot;Um 
if I say you&#39;re welcome will you get off me? It&#39;s totally wrong to have 
my cousin straddling me.&quot;

Rikku giggled and stood. &quot;Sorry Yunie.&quot; She extended her hand to help 
Yuna back up off the bed. 

Yuna took Rikku&#39;s hand and stood and a smirked formed on her lips and 
before either of them knew what was happing Yuna had them both pinned 
down on Paine&#39;s bed. Yuna smiled. &quot;You know what Paine despite what 
others may think you&#39;re actually comfy.&quot;

Paine shook her head and looked at Yuna from the corner of her eye. &quot;I 
am huh?&quot; Paine smirked a bit when she saw Brother and Buddy standing at 
the foot of the bed slacked jawed. &quot;What&#39;s the matter boys didn&#39;t know I 
so popular among women?&quot; A chuckle escaped Paine&#39;s lips as Yuna and 
Rikku jumped up. Paine folded her arms behind her head and just smirked 
at the four people looking at her. &quot;What?&quot;

Yuna recovered quickly speaking quickly. &quot;I&#39;m just really hyper and 
sorta pounced Paine and Rikku it wasn&#39;t what it looked like honest.&quot;

Brother looked at his little sister first then at Yuna and lastly at 
Paine. &quot;Is Yuna sure?&quot;

Paine smirked and got off the bed and draped her arm over Yuna and 
Rikku&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Of course it was what it looked like.&quot; Paine winked 
at Brother. &quot;Sorry man but you just can&#39;t beat leather.&quot; At first Yuna 
thought about pulling away but seeing Rikku slide her arm around Paine&#39;s 
waist made her play along too and slide her hand around Paine&#39;s waist 
and turning just enough so her stomach was facing Paine and she slid her 
other hand up Paine&#39;s body slowly resting her hand on the skull that 
clasped Paine&#39;s studded leather closed around her chest placing a soft 
kiss on Paine&#39;s neck. Rikku put her other hand on Paine&#39;s shoulder and 
rested her chin on her hand. Paine smirked. &quot;See.&quot;

Buddy smiled a bit. &quot;Damn girl remind me to ask you what your secret is 
later.&quot;

&quot;Then it wouldn&#39;t be a secret would it.&quot;

Buddy pouted playfully. &quot;Your mean, after all the spears I&#39;ve found for 
you guys to claim.&quot;

&quot;Well if you put it that way I guess I can tell you but you know if you 
tell anyone I&#39;ll have to kill you.&quot;
      
Buddy nodded. &quot;I&#39;ll talk to you later about it.&quot; 

Paine nodded as Buddy and Brother left. The smirk slowing forming back 
on Paine&#39;s lips. &quot;You guys comfy?&quot; 

Yuna smiled and bit Paine&#39;s neck softly causing the taller girl to moan 
softly. &quot;Perfectly.&quot;

Rikku blushed softly hearing Paine moan and kissed her neck softly. &quot;Yea 
I am thank you.&quot;

Paine smiled and shook her head. &quot;So what do you suggest we do? I mean 
other then hang on me.&quot;

Yuna whispered in Paine&#39;s ear. &quot;How bout we do you then?&quot;

Paine&#39;s eyes got wide as she spoke softly. &quot;Yuna...&quot;

Rikku looked at her cousin and let go of Paine and drug Yuna off to the 
side. &quot;Yunie whats gotten into you?&quot; Yuna shrugged. &quot;Don&#39;t shrug at me 
what are you doing? You&#39;ve been acting weird lately and in all honesty 
now whats going on between you and Paine? I mean that was a pretty 
turned on moan she uttered.&quot;

Yuna blushed. &quot;Honestly Rikku me and Paine did talk about it in Luca and 
have decided to give it a try.&quot;

Rikku began to bounce a little. &quot;So I see you guys are a thing now cool. 
Maybe now she won&#39;t be such a party pooper.&quot;

&quot;45 Rikku.&quot;

&quot;Damn it! Awwww come on Paine I was just joking around please don&#39;t take 
any respect points away please!&quot; Rikku whined and looked at Paine with 
pleading green eyes.

Paine sighed. &quot;I suppose you could earn them back.&quot;

&quot;How! HOW! Name it I&#39;ll do it.&quot; Rikku pouted looking at Paine.

&quot;I&#39;ll let you know when I think of something.&quot; Rikku face faulted and 
growled at Paine. &quot;Don&#39;t growl or I won&#39;t let you earn them back.&quot; Rikku 
nodded and sat on the bed.    

Yuna sat down next to her cousin and looked up at Paine. Standing 
quickly Yuna smiled &quot;I got it! How bout we go play in the blitzball 
tournament.&quot;

Paine shrugged her shoulders. &quot;Up to you guys, I could go for a game.&quot;

Yuna ran to the bridge and talked to Brother, Buddy and Shinra, and 
finally after all of Yuna&#39;s begging they agreed. The Gullwings signed up 
and walking to the stadium they ran into Wakka and the Besaide Auroks. 
While they were talking a guy from the Luca Goers walked past nudging 
Yuna hard knocking her forward into Wakka. Paine growled. &quot;He&#39;s getting 
hurt excuse me.&quot; Paine walked off before anyone could stop her. She 
caught up and whistled and the guy turned around. &quot;You think your tough 
pushing the high summoner? Why not pushing me?&quot;

The guy smirked. &quot;What you think you can take me? Fine girly lets see 
what you got.&quot; The guy ran towards Paine and swung hard. 

Paine smirked and easily dodged his swing and knocking him down with a 
well placed sweeper kick. &quot;Looks like I got more then you do punk.&quot;

The guy had fallen flat on his face and looked up at Paine. &quot;We&#39;ll 
finish this on the court. Just try and stay outta my way.&quot;

Paine smirked. &quot;I look forward to it.&quot; Paine winked at them as she 
walked away.

The other guy got up slowly and shook his head. His team mate walked 
over by him. &quot;You pushed the high summoner? What the hell is the matter 
with you? This is her calm man if it wasn&#39;t for her Sin would be still 
attacking.&quot; 

Paine walked back over by her teammates and friends and folded her arms 
across her chest and looked at Yuna. &quot;You ok?&quot;

Yuna looked at Paine and smiled a little then nodded. &quot;Yea I&#39;m ok.&quot; 

Paine nodded. &quot;Good lets go play huh?&quot;

***********************************************************

The games went on and finally the last game was the Goers vs. the 
Gullwings Paine scanned the field and saw the guy she fought with 
earlier was the center. She swam up to Yuna and told her she&#39;d take 
center that game and why and Yuna nodded and took Paine&#39;s place on 
defense. Rikku was the other defender. Paine swam up to Rikku. &quot;You 
still wanna earn those points back?&quot; Rikku nodded. &quot;Ok see the Goers 
center?&quot; Rikku nodded again. &quot;Well he&#39;s the one who shoved Yuna and well 
he&#39;s got it in for me just make sure nothing happens to Yuna ok.&quot; Rikku 
nodded. &quot;Ok if you do a good job there&#39;s 5 extra points in it for ya.&quot;

Rikku nodded. &quot;You can count on me Paine.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; Paine nodded and swam back to the center. *This could be a 
painful game for me* Paine kept an emotionless look on her face as the 
whistle blew and her and the guy both jumped for the ball. Paine got it 
easily and just as she went to pass the guy hit her hard in the ribs. 
Paine growled as he took the ball. He went to pass and it was Paine and 
Buddy on the block. He dodged Buddy&#39;s block but Paine was close behind 
Buddy and he had no time to react the heal of Paine&#39;s boot hit him right 
in the face. Paine took the ball from him and passed it to Buddy who 
turned around and scored. Yuna looked at Paine as she swam back to the 
center worry showing in her eyes. Paine nodded to her and offered her a 
faint smile. Yuna nodded back and Paine winked at her and took her 
position in the center. This time before Paine ever got a hand on the 
ball the guy charged her hitting her harder then before. The referee 
called it as an illegal play and called Paine an injured player. Paine 
shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m ok I can play.&quot; The referee nodded and it was the 
guys turn to growl. He took the ball and charged towards the Gullwings 
goal he easily took Rikku out and before he could charge Yuna he was hit 
from behind by Paine. The blow had stunned him long enough for Yuna to 
pass Paine the ball. Paine whistled again and taunted the guy before 
passing the ball. The game went on like this till the game was tied at 
6. Paine took her position and growled and then as she jumped for the 
blitzball she tightened every muscle in her body and braced for the blow 
she knew was coming. The guy&#39;s knee hit Paine square in the face 
knocking her back. Paine shook her head a few times to clear her vision. 
When it was clear again she saw him charging at Yuna once again. Paine 
whistled and the guy looked at her from the corner of his eye. Rikku 
blocked him nice hitting him in the shoulder hard. Paine swam up behind 
him and hit him just right where the blow knocked him out. She took the 
ball and winked at Yuna. &quot;Watch this.&quot; Paine turned and shot from where 
she was at and as the clock was counting down the ball hit the goal. The 
guy came to and saw everyone leaving the court. Once back by the locker 
rooms the Gullwings were all talking and Lulu was making sure Paine was 
ok. 

The Goers past and the guy saw Paine leaning against the wall. &quot;This 
ain&#39;t over girly.&quot; 

Paine stood straight and looked at the guy and flipped her hair. &quot;Bring 
it punk.&quot; As the guy charged her he pulled out a small dagger. Paine 
smirked and just as he got there she drew her sword and blocked his 
dagger and pushed him to the ground and rested the point of her sword at 
the guy&#39;s throat. 

Yuna ran over and pleaded with Paine. &quot;Paine please don&#39;t do this.&quot;

Paine glared at the guy and growled. &quot;You&#39;re lucky we have bigger fish 
to fry.&quot; She made a slight movement and cut him before walking away. 

Lulu hissed. &quot;You don&#39;t mess with the High Summoner in front of her 
guardians and get away with it.&quot; Lulu tossed a low level fire ball at 
him and walked off as he attempted to dodge it.     

***********************************************************
Back on the Celsius Paine sat on her bed and sang softly not knowing any 
one was around to hear her.

~Ever felt away with me
Just once that all I need
Entwined in finding you one day

Ever felt away without me
My love, it lies so deep
Ever dream of me

Would you do it with me
Heal the scars and change the stars
Would you do it for me
Turn loose the heaven within

I&#39;d take you away
Castaway on a lonely day
Bosom for a teary cheek
My song can but borrow your grace

Come out, come out wherever you are
So lost in your sea
Give in, give in for my touch
For my taste for my lust

Your beauty cascaded on me
In this white night fantasy

&quot;All I ever craved were the two dreams I shared with you.
One I now have, will the other one ever dream remain.
For yours I truly wish to be.&quot;~ 

Yuna looked at Paine and walked towards her and crawled across Paine&#39;s 
bed and wrapped her arms around Paine&#39;s waist and placed a few soft 
kisses on her neck. &quot;You ok sexy?&quot;

A faint chuckle escaped Paine&#39;s lips. &quot;Yea I&#39;m fine why?&quot;

&quot;Well the song you were just singing sounded so sad.&quot;

Paine blushed slightly. &quot;You heard me huh?&quot;

&quot;Yes I did and you really do have a beautiful voice.&quot;

&quot;Yea well let&#39;s just keep that little detail secret ok.&quot;

Rikku smiled. &quot;What secret?&quot; 

Paine sighed. &quot;If you want to keep the 55 points you have you&#39;ll take 
back that question.&quot;

Rikku&#39;s eyes got wide. &quot;Ok I take it back.&quot; Rikku smiled a little and 
sat down next to Paine. &quot;How are you though I mean you took 5 hellish 
blows out there?&quot;

Paine looked over at the younger girl. &quot;I&#39;m ok Rikku.&quot;

Rikku smiled. &quot;Good cuz Yunie will need a good pillow.&quot;

Paine shook her head and grabbed Rikku in a head lock. &quot;Keep it up Rikku 
and you&#39;ll be back at 50.&quot;

Rikku giggled. &quot;Ok, ok I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ll stop picking on you now.&quot;  

The girls all went and sat down at a table with the drinks Paine had 
mixed for them and talked about random things as the sun slowly set. 
Rikku stretched and yawned. &quot;I&#39;ll see you two in the morning I&#39;m beat.&quot; 
Paine and Yuna nodded. &quot;Oh and Paine remember what I said ok.&quot; Rikku 
giggled and winked at Paine. 

Paine rolled her eyes and chuckled slightly. &quot;Yea, yea you&#39;re pushing it 
Rikku.&quot; A sly smile formed on the leather clad girls lips. 

Yuna put a hand on Paine&#39;s thigh and smiled and spoke softly. &quot;You know 
Rikku was right I do plan on sleeping with you tonight.&quot;    

Paine nodded as she looked at Yuna. &quot;I know Yuna.&quot; Paine flipped her 
hair like she usually did and offered a soft smile to Yuna. A very soft 
expression sat on the usually emotionless girls face.

&quot;Paine...&quot; Yuna whispered as she looked at the taller girl. 

A faint smile sat on Paine&#39;s lips as she spoke softly. &quot;I know Yuna...I 
know.&quot; 

Just as Paine leaned into to kiss Yuna Rikku leaned over the balcony and 
spoke not realizing what she just interrupted. &quot;Hey Paine thanks again 
for the candy and...for doctoring...my...cuts...um I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m going 
to bed now.&quot; The young blonde turned away and was about to walk to her 
bed when she heard Paine speak. 

&quot;Hey Rikku!&quot; the blonde looked back at Paine. &quot;Don&#39;t mention it. Just 
don&#39;t tell anyone I&#39;ve got a soft side ok it&#39;ll ruin my whole 
reputation.&quot; Paine chuckled a bit and offered Rikku a soft smile.

Rikku returned the smile. &quot;I won&#39;t I promise.&quot; Rikku nodded to her 
cousin. &quot;Night Yunie.&quot; Rikku then turned away and walked to her bed. 

Yuna smiled and spoke softly. &quot;Let&#39;s go sit up on the deck and look at 
the stars for a while I&#39;m not sleepy at all.&quot;

Paine nodded and took Yuna&#39;s hand and interlocked their finger and the 
two walked towards the elevator when Buddy stopped them. &quot;Ok so what is 
your secret Paine?&quot;

Paine chuckled and shook her head then shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s the leather man, 
chicks dig the leather.&quot; 

Buddy nodded and smiled. &quot;That&#39;s it just the leather?&quot; Paine nodded. 
&quot;Alright...&quot; Buddy smiled. &quot;You two behave.&quot; He smiled at the two as he 
walked off.

Paine shook her head and glanced at Yuna. &quot;Still want to go look at the 
stars?&quot;

Yuna smiled widely. &quot;You bet, come on Paine.&quot; Yuna pulled Paine to the 
elevator and selected the deck level and the two walked out onto the 
deck and stood there in the middle of the large deck and Yuna looked up 
at the stars then over at Paine and smiled and stood on her tip toes and 
pressed her lips to Paine&#39;s and followed suit with Paine&#39;s reaction. 
Paine wrapped her arms around Yuna and kissed her passionately yet 
tenderly. Yuna moaned softly into the kiss and wrapped her arms around 
Paine. 

Paine slid one hand down Yuna&#39;s body and pulled her close holding the 
high summoner tighter and reluctantly broke the kiss and simply looked 
deep into Yuna&#39;s eyes. &quot;I...&quot; Paine smiled a bit.

&quot;You what?&quot; Yuna smirked slightly.

Paine simply smiled and leaned in and kissed Yuna&#39;s neck tenderly and 
spoke softly. &quot;I love you.&quot;

Yuna closed her eyes and enjoyed the feel of Paine&#39;s lips on her neck 
and soft moan escaped her lips. &quot;I love you too.&quot; Yuna moaned softly 
again and reluctantly stopped Paine. &quot;Please tell me what you said 
earlier in Luca.&quot;

Paine smiled. &quot;You mean nud y tyo kuac po dryd E tuh&#39;d muja oui Yuna?&quot; 
Yuna nodded. &quot;Not a day goes by that I don&#39;t love you Yuna.&quot;

Yuna blushed and spoke softly. &quot;Paine...&quot;

Paine touched her finger to Yuna&#39;s lips and shook her head. &quot;Don&#39;t speak 
just feel.&quot; Paine then kissed Yuna deeply moaning softly into the kiss. 
Her leather covered hands exploring Yuna&#39;s slender yet toned body. Yuna 
moaned softly into the kiss and slipped her hand up under Paine&#39;s 
leather shirt and cupped Paine&#39;s left breast and messaged it gently 
causing the warrior to moan. Paine ran a gloved hand down Yuna&#39;s body 
and unbuttoned her shorts and began to pet her softly through her satin 
thong causing Yuna to jerk slightly and bite Paine&#39;s lower lip. Paine 
moaned softly feeling Yuna&#39;s teeth on her. Paine looked at Yuna and 
licked the blood from her lip and smiled a bit not stopping what she was 
doing with her hand her voice low as she spoke. &quot;Sorry I...&quot; Yuna cut 
her off with a very deep passionate kiss slowly pulling Paine down as 
her knees began to give. Paine ran her thumb over Yuna&#39;s clit as they 
kissed causing the high summoner to gasp and plead with her warrior.

&quot;Please...don&#39;t...tease...&quot;

Paine smirked and slipped her hand inside Yuna&#39;s thong and slipped two 
fingers in. &quot;As you wish.&quot; Yuna lulled her head back and let out a loud 
moan as Paine kissed up along Yuna&#39;s throat. Paine mixed soft nibbles in 
with the tender kisses she was placing on Yuna&#39;s neck. Yuna ran her 
nails down Paine&#39;s back causing the warrior to moan and roll her 
shoulders. Yuna looked at Paine and smiled softly then leaned in and 
kissed her leather clad lover deeply on the lips her one hand still 
under Paine&#39;s leather shirt. Yuna slowly drug her hand down Paine&#39;s body 
slowly resting her hand over Paine&#39;s scar. Paine slowly broke the kiss 
and looked at Yuna and smirked a bit before quickening the pace with her 
fingers curling them and adding a third quickly pulling Yuna closer with 
her free hand. The smirk on Paine&#39;s face grew as she realized where 
Yuna&#39;s hand sat. &quot;I take it you like the feel of that scar. Well at 
least the location of it.&quot; Yuna&#39;s only response was arching her back and 
snapping her head back and repeating her lover&#39;s name. Her fevered cries 
were soon silenced by a series of soft kisses placed upon her lips. 
Paine slowly stopped what she was doing and removed her gloved hand from 
Yuna&#39;s shorts and the brunette fell forward into her lover&#39;s arms 
resting her head on her chest simply listing to her heartbeat. Paine 
licked her gloved fingers clean then wrapped them around Yuna. Paine 
smiled softly. &quot;You ok?&quot; Yuna nodded. Paine smiled as Yuna wrapped her 
arms around her and pressed herself against Paine closer. &quot;Comfy Yuna?&quot;

Yuna smiled and spoke softly. &quot;Very...Paine will you promise me 
something?&quot;

Paine smiled softly. &quot;Anything Yuna...&quot;

&quot;Promise me this is for real.&quot;

Paine blinked a few times and kissed the top of Yuna&#39;s head. &quot;I promise 
you I won&#39;t ever disappear on you. You&#39;re stuck with me.&quot; Paine chuckled 
a bit. &quot;Besides this is as real as you want it to be Yuna.&quot;

Yuna looked up at Paine with teary eyes and chuckled. &quot;I&#39;m glad I got 
stuck with a beautiful woman, and I want this to be very real.&quot;

Paine brushed the single tear off Yuna&#39;s cheek. &quot;I assure you I&#39;m far 
from beautiful compared to you but it&#39;s totally real I promise you 
that.&quot; At that Paine pulled Yuna close to her and sighed contently and 
looked out at the sky in front of them. Yuna rebuttoned her shorts then 
snuggled close to Paine and closed her eyes and started to drift off to 
sleep listening to the sound of Paine&#39;s heartbeat. 

Brother ran to the cabin to find Yuna but only found Rikku. &quot;Rikku wake 
up where is Yuna?&quot; Rikku groaned and rolled over. &quot;Come on is important 
we found him.&quot;

Rikku shot up in bed. &quot;FRYD!!!!!!!!!&quot;* 

*Rikku: &quot;WHAT!!!!!!!&quot;

&quot;Yea he&#39;s on the bridge.&quot;

&quot;Yunie must still be up on the deck...&quot;

Before Rikku could finish Brother took off for the deck. Rikku jumped up 
and ran after him but Brother beat her to the deck. &quot;Yuna come 
quick...Yuna?&quot;

Rikku slapped him hard in the head and smiled looking at her friends. 
&quot;You idiot! Go back to the bridge I&#39;ll bring Yunie and Paine now go.&quot; 
Rikku kicked Brother square in the ass causing him to fall down the few 
stairs they were on. By now Yuna and Paine had glanced over at them. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry you guys but um Yunie um...&quot;

Yuna looked at her cousin. &quot;Just say it Rikku.&quot; Yuna and Paine stood up 
and walked over by Rikku. &quot;Well what is it?&quot;

&quot;Um...well...you see...um...&quot;

Paine crossed her arms across her chest. &quot;Spit it out or I&#39;ll start 
deducting points.&quot;

&quot;Ok fine...Yunie they found him......&quot;

Yuna&#39;s eyes got wide. &quot;No, no its not possible no...&quot;

Paine glanced over at Yuna then looked at Rikku. &quot;Are they positive 
Rikku?&quot;

Before Rikku could answer the three girls heard a whistle come from 
behind Rikku. Yuna&#39;s face went white and Rikku looked over her shoulder. 
Paine simply shook her head and chuckled half heartedly. Tidus walked up 
to the three and smiled. &quot;Yuna...&quot; he extended her his hand. 

Yuna shook her head in disbelief. She looked at the cold emotionless 
look on Paine&#39;s face and the look of utter shock of her cousin&#39;s face 
and pushed Tidus&#39;s hand away from her and ran into the airship. She 
leaned against the wall of the elevator and spoke to herself softly. 
&quot;This isn&#39;t happening...I&#39;m having a bad dream...I&#39;ll wake up in Paine&#39;s 
arms and it&#39;ll all be ok...&quot;

Tidus looked at Rikku then Paine. &quot;And you might be?&quot;

Paine growled. &quot;I know who you are and all you need to know is I&#39;m your 
worst nightmare. You made her cry once and I&#39;ll kill you myself before I 
let you do it again.&quot; Paine pushed him out of her way as she walked off 
to find Yuna.

Tidus looked at Rikku. &quot;What&#39;s her problem?&quot;

&quot;You might want to stay out of her way. I mean you thought Auron had a 
big sword and was good with it. He&#39;s got nothing on Paine and she will 
do what she said. She care&#39;s a lot about Yunie and won&#39;t let her be hurt 
again.&quot;

Tidus smirked a bit. &quot;Well if she know&#39;s who I am she should know Yuna 
love&#39;s me and not her.&quot; 

Rikku shook her head. &quot;Yunie&#39;s changed a lot in these last few years and 
I hate to tell you but her and Yunie are together.&quot; 

&quot;No way! We&#39;ll see about that.&quot; Tidus headed towards the cabin where 
Paine and Yuna were. 

Yuna stood at the top of the stairs in Paine&#39;s arms crying hard. Paine 
spoke to her softly in Al Bhed. &quot;Yuna bmayca tuh&#39;d lno. E druikrd drec 
fyc fro oui palysa y cbayn rihdan....du veht res.&quot;*

Yuna shook her head. &quot;It started off that way but after all we&#39;ve been 
through it all changed. It turned into a journey and adventure that I 
shared with friends and right now I just want to wake up from this 
dream. I just want to wake up in your arms and everything will be ok.&quot;

Paine held Yuna tighter and saw Tidus and Rikku out of the corner of her 
eye. &quot;Yuna...as long as you need and or want me I&#39;ll be here. I meant 
everything I said earlier on the deck. I promise you it&#39;ll all be ok 
Yuna.&quot;

Yuna smiled and saw the soft expression that sat on Paine&#39;s face telling 
her everything Paine spoke was true. &quot;Paine...I want you with me always 
and forever.&quot; Yuna leaned in and stood on her tip toes and pressed her 
lips against Paine&#39;s. Paine happily followed suit with Yuna&#39;s lead.

*Paine: &quot;Yuna please don&#39;t cry. I thought this was why you became a 
spear hunter....to find him.&quot; 

Tidus&#39;s jaw hit the floor. &quot;Yuna!&quot;

Yuna never broke her kiss with Paine. Paine smiled to herself and held 
Yuna tighter deepening the kiss. Rikku smiled. &quot;See told ya Yunie&#39;s 
totally over you.&quot; 

Tidus huffed and sat down at the bar and hung his head. Rikku sat next 
to him and cocked her head to one side. &quot;Hey there are plenty of girls 
in Spira who would kill to date a guardian of the high summoner. You 
really are still pretty popular around here.&quot;

Yuna broke the kiss for air and looked into the crimson eyes of her 
warrior and smiled softly before resting her head against Paine&#39;s chest. 
&quot;Paine E muja oui cu silr yht tecbeda fryd drec zuinhao cdyndat uid yc 
ed ymm lryhkat e sahd fryd e cyet eh Luca.&quot;*

Paine smiled softly. &quot;I know Yuna...I know...&quot; Paine looked down at 
Tidus and Rikku and back at Yuna. &quot;Don&#39;t you at least want to go talk to 
him? I mean you have been looking for him for a while.&quot;

Yuna looked up at Paine and smiled softly. &quot;Come with me?&quot;

Paine looked at Yuna and half smiled. &quot;We&#39;ve already spoke and...&quot;

&quot;Please Paine.&quot; Yuna looked up at Paine with pleading eyes.

Paine whimpered a bit and then sighed. &quot;You cheat...Fine I&#39;ll walk down 
there with you, but don&#39;t expect me to say anything.&quot;

Yuna smiled and grabbed Paine&#39;s hand and interlocked their fingers. The 
two girls walked down the stairs Paine lagging behind a bit. Yuna 
stopped behind Tidus and cleared her throat. Paine let Yuna&#39;s hand go 
and crossed her arms across her chest and just looked between Yuna and 
Tidus. Yuna looked back at Paine and frowned realizing her hand was now 
empty. Paine in turn gave her a soft look and nodded slightly. Yuna gave 
Paine a soft smile and nodded in return. Rikku smiled at the two of 
them. &quot;You two are so cute. Come on Paine lets leave them alone huh.&quot;

Paine nodded and Yuna looked at them both. &quot;Please stay really its ok.&quot;  

*Yuna: I love you so much and despite what this journey started out as 
it all changed I meant what I said in Luca. 

Rikku and Paine shrugged and Paine walked behind the bar and grabbed a 
bottle and four glasses, just to be considerate of Tidus, and her and 
Rikku went and sat at a table. Yuna shook her head. &quot;Come on we&#39;ll go 
join then.&quot; Tidus nodded and they went and sat down. Yuna sat next to 
Paine and took her hand once again interlacing their fingers. Paine 
simply smiled ever so softly.

Rikku blinked and then smirked. &quot;Was that a smile Paine?&quot; Paine simply 
shrugged her shoulders. &quot;It was wasn&#39;t it? Ooooh Yunie got you to smile. 
Stone cold Dr. P smiled.&quot;

Paine sighed. &quot;45 Rikku.&quot;

&quot;Damn it!&quot; Rikku pouted.

Yuna chuckled. &quot;You think you would have learned by now Rikku. But half 
the fun is seeing how you can loose them then get them back by sucking 
up.&quot;

Paine smirked. &quot;85 Yuna.&quot;

Yuna looked at Paine. &quot;Now that&#39;s not funny.&quot; Yuna looked at Rikku and 
shook her head. 

Tidus looked at the three girls. &quot;What are you talking about with the 45 
and the 85?&quot;

Rikku giggled. &quot;It&#39;s an inside joke between us don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;

Tidus nodded and looked at Yuna. &quot;So is everything I&#39;ve heard true?&quot;

Yuna slung her drink and motioned for Paine to refill it. &quot;Depends on 
what you&#39;ve heard.&quot;

&quot;Well for one that you&#39;ve been a spear hunter since I left. And from 
what I&#39;ve seen tonight you seem to love her.&quot; Tidus frowned and slung 
his drink and gave Paine a soft nod when she refilled it for him.

Yuna nodded. &quot;Yes it&#39;s true I&#39;ve been a spear hunter and yes I do love 
Paine. Did you really think I would wait for someone I would probably 
never see again? We looked for you for 2 years and within those two 
years I realized why keep searching when the whole time someone who 
loved me was right here.&quot; Paine squeezed Yuna&#39;s hand softly and offered 
her a soft look. 

Tidus nodded. &quot;I guess that&#39;s fair. You guys wouldn&#39;t know of any single 
girls would ya?&quot;

Paine chuckled slightly and slung her drink. &quot;Up for a challenge Tidus?&quot;

Tidus looked at her. &quot;Depends. What do I get if I win?&quot;

Paine chuckled and held up a slip of paper. &quot;A list of girls from Yuna&#39;s 
fan club that were interested in you.&quot;

&quot;Paine where did you get that?&quot; Yuna blinked a few times and looked at 
the silver haired girl. Paine simply winked. &quot;80 Paine.&quot; 

Paine chuckled and looked at Yuna. &quot;Fair enough, but I demand a chance 
to get the 20 back.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough and I do too.&quot;

Paine nodded. &quot;So how about it?&quot;

Tidus nodded. &quot;You&#39;re on! What&#39;s the challenge?&quot;

Paine smirked. &quot;You have to sling one drink I mix without falling out of 
the chair.&quot;

&quot;Bring it that&#39;s too easy.&quot;

Paine chuckled and stood up. &quot;Ok I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; Paine walked 
behind the bar and started to mix the drinking starting and ending with 
151. 

Rikku looked at Tidus wide eyed. &quot;Um Tidus that was dumb.&quot;

&quot;Why it&#39;s just a drink.&quot;

Yuna chuckled. &quot;Yes one of Paine drinks. Um they are beyond strong and 
seeings how your already on her bad side it&#39;ll be double strong.&quot;

Paine set the drink down. &quot;I&#39;m not that mean Yuna it&#39;s not a double but 
it is strong.&quot;

Tidus looked at the drink and then back at Paine. &quot;I&#39;ll sling it if you 
take a straight double shot of whatever I choose.&quot;

Paine sat down and shrugged. &quot;Fair enough.&quot;

Tidus stood and walked behind the bar and looked at the bottles and 
picked up the 151 bottle and poured a double shot and walk back over and 
set it in front of Paine. &quot;If you sling that and stay in your seat then 
you deserve to be with Yuna.&quot;

Paine nodded and Rikku shook her head and spoke quickly. &quot;Ok you two on 
the count of three, seeing how their about even...ready? 
1......2......3!&quot; 

Paine and Tidus slung their drinks at the same time. Paine shook her 
head and put her glass down upside down. Tidus started to sway but 
caught himself before he fell from the chair. Paine chuckled and set the 
piece of paper down on the table. &quot;I&#39;m a woman of my word you didn&#39;t 
fall so here&#39;s the list.&quot; A smirk sat on Paine&#39;s lips as he opened it.

&quot;Hey I remember a few of them from when I was with Yuna as her guardian. 
Hey cool and some of them are even cute if I remember correctly.&quot;

Yuna shook her head and looked at the two. &quot;You guys ok?&quot; Paine nodded 
and shook her head again. &quot;Are you sure?&quot;

Paine winked at Yuna. &quot;I&#39;m fine honest.&quot;

Rikku smiled. &quot;Well I&#39;m going back to bed goodnight all.&quot;

Yuna watched Rikku walk up to bed then looked at Paine then back at 
Tidus. &quot;You can take my bed tonight I&#39;ll sleep with Paine.&quot; Tidus nodded 
and the three of them walked up the stairs. Yuna smiled seeing that 
Rikku was lying in her bed. &quot;The bed to the right there is mine. We 
should be in Besaide by morning so I&#39;ll wake you when we get there.&quot;

Tidus nodded and crawled into Rikku&#39;s bed and quickly fell asleep. Yuna 
crawled into bed with Paine and snuggled close. Rikku opened one eye and 
looked at her cousin and friend. &quot;You two behave over there.&quot; 

Before Paine could deduct any more points from Rikku Yuna spoke softly. 
&quot;I&#39;m too tired to do anything but sleep so go to sleep ok.&quot; Yuna drifted 
off to sleep in Paine&#39;s arms listing to her heart beat.

***********************************************************

A few hours past and the sun was up. Buddy walked into the cabin and 
told Barkeep to get the coffee brewin and he slowly climbed the stairs. 
A smile forming on his lips at the site in front of him. *Its about time 
those two got together. I thought Tidus showing up would put a damper on 
everything nice to see it hasn&#39;t* Buddy smirked. &quot;Gullwings report for 
duty.&quot; 

Paine growled and threw a pillow at Buddy. &quot;Fuck you Buddy I&#39;m not 
moving.&quot;

Yuna smiled a bit and chuckled and leaned in and whispered in her 
lover&#39;s ear. &quot;Get up and I&#39;ll make sure you enjoy your day.&quot; 

Paine opened one eye and spoke in a groggy tone. &quot;You&#39;re evil.&quot; Not 
realizing how small the bed really was Paine let go of Yuna and started 
to roll over on her back to stretch and fell to floor causing Rikku to 
bust up laughing. &quot;30 Rikku.&quot; Paine stood up and stretched cracking her 
neck then rolling her shoulders. &quot;I need coffee.&quot; Paine clomped down the 
stairs and sat at the bar and Barkeep set a cup of coffee in front of 
Paine. Yuna started to chuckle after she was sure Paine was out of 
hearing range. &quot;80 Yuna.&quot;

&quot;Come on Paine that&#39;s not fair how do you expect me and Rikku not to 
laugh at that.&quot; Yuna stood at the balcony and looked over at the crimson 
eyed warrior.

Paine looked up at Yuna and shook her head and chuckled a bit. &quot;Nice 
hair babe really.&quot;

Yuna huffed. &quot;75 Paine.&quot; Yuna then turned away with her back to the 
balcony. 

Paine walked up the stairs and stood in front of Yuna and leaned in and 
whispered in her ear. &quot;I&#39;ll make it up to you in the shower later ok.&quot;

Yuna smiled. &quot;Ok...I hope you know I&#39;m holding you to that.&quot;

Paine smirked as she stood up and started to walk away. &quot;I hope so.&quot; 
Paine smirked again evilly as she pushed Tidus out of Rikku&#39;s bed with a 
well placed foot to his ass. &quot;Get up it&#39;s your fault I gotta be up so 
damn early.&quot; Paine continued down the stairs as everyone laughed at what 
she had done. She sat back down at the bar and asked Barkeep to refill 
her coffee.

Tidus slowly rose from the floor. &quot;Does she usually do that?&quot;

Rikku shrugged. &quot;First morning she was here I got ice cold water dumped 
on me because Yunie woke her up early after keeping her up all night 
talking to her. So I&#39;d consider yourself lucky.&quot;

Paine sat at the bar with her head down. &quot;Ish Miss Paine okays?&quot; 

Paine looked up at Barkeep and nodded. &quot;Yeah I&#39;m ok Barkeep thanks I&#39;m 
still tired is all just keep the coffee coming ok.&quot; Barkeep nodded. 

Yuna, Rikku, Tidus and Buddy walked down and joined Paine at the bar 
Yuna sitting on one side of her Buddy on the other. Buddy smiled a bit 
and talked to Paine in Al Bhed. &quot;E caa oui vehymmo dumt ran ruf oui 
vamd.&quot;*

Paine shook her head. &quot;Uhmo yvdan cra crufat ruf cra vamd.&quot;*

Yuna smirked. &quot;Well if I didn&#39;t you wouldn&#39;t be here right now with us 
would you.&quot;

Buddy looked at her. &quot;You understood that?&quot;

Yuna smiled widely and nodded. &quot;Yes Paine&#39;s been teaching me.&quot;

&quot;Yea Paine ruined Yunie and all my fun.&quot; Rikku pouted. &quot;I mean I was 
able to pick on her before now I can&#39;t.&quot;

Yuna folded her arms. &quot;Hey I&#39;m Al Bhed too you know. Well half so I 
might as well know how to speak it.&quot; 

*Buddy: &quot;I see you finally told her how you felt.&quot;

*Paine: &quot;only after she showed me how she felt.&quot;

Paine smirked. &quot;She&#39;s got a point Rikku it is only fair she knows the 
language.&quot;

Rikku stuck her tongue out at Paine. &quot;And just how do you know the 
language huh Miss Dark and Mysterious Past?&quot;

Paine rolled her eyes and shook her head. &quot;For one my past isn&#39;t that 
dark it&#39;s just mysterious because I don&#39;t talk about it. And I know the 
language because my mother was Al Bhed.&quot;

Rikku noted the sober tone Paine used. &quot;Why do you sound so sad when you 
speak of your mother?&quot;

Paine looked at Rikku and sighed. &quot;I lost both of my parents to Sin. Not 
that I miss my father too much he was a drunk.&quot; Paine turned her gaze 
towards her cup of coffee closing her eyes to conceal the fact her eyes 
were glazed over and she took a deep breath to stop any emotion from 
showing. Paine stood from her seat. &quot;I&#39;ll catch up with you guys in 
Besaide. I&#39;m gonna go take a shower.&quot; At that Paine walked off.

Yuna watched Paine walk off then turned to her cousin. &quot;Did you really 
have to ask Rikku?&quot;

Rikku frowned. &quot;I expected her to deduct points from me for being nosey. 
I honestly didn&#39;t expect her to answer me.&quot; Rikku saw Paine was just 
exiting the cabin and called out to her. &quot;Paine wait.&quot; 

Paine sighed and swallowed her emotion back and stopped. &quot;What it is 
Rikku?&quot;

Rikku frowned. &quot;I just wanted to say I was sorry.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot; Paine looked at her a bit confused

&quot;For asking you that question I expected you to deduct points for being 
noisy not answer me.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it Rikku.&quot; Paine walked past Rikku and disappeared 
into the elevator.

Rikku sighed and walked back to the bar and sat down. &quot;Oh I&#39;m such a 
dumb ass. Paine probably hates me now.&quot;

Yuna rubbed her back. &quot;I&#39;m sure she doesn&#39;t Rikku. I&#39;ll go talk to her 
ok. Excuse me.&quot; Yuna stood and walked from the cabin.

Paine stood in the shower with head hung as the warm water washed over 
her she allowed the tears to fall freely. Paine took a deep breath when 
she felt a bare woman&#39;s chest press up against her back and she smiled a 
bit feeling their arms wrap around her and spoke softly. &quot;Yuna...&quot;

Yuna smiled and placed a soft kiss between Paine&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Yup.&quot; 
Yuna giggled a bit. &quot;How&#39;d ya guess?&quot;

Paine chuckled. &quot;You&#39;re the only one who would dare follow me into the 
shower.&quot;

Yuna smiled widely. &quot;Are you complaining?&quot;

Paine shook her head and turned in Yuna&#39;s arms. &quot;No are you?&quot;

Yuna blushed a little. &quot;Not one bit.&quot;

Paine leaned in and kissed Yuna deeply. &quot;So did you follow me in here 
for a reason or just to be naughty?&quot;

Yuna moaned a bit. &quot;If I tell you will you do more then just kiss me?&quot; 
Paine smirked and nodded. &quot;Rikku thinks you hate her now because she 
asked you about your mother.&quot; 

Paine chuckled. &quot;I&#39;ll talk to Rikku later.&quot; Paine then leaned in and 
kissed Yuna deeply pressing her against the wall of the shower. Yuna 
moaned into the kiss dragging her tongue up along Paine&#39;s and out of her 
mouth breaking the kiss of and simply looked into the crimson eyes of 
her lover. Paine offered Yuna a soft smile as she trailed her hand down 
Yuna&#39;s body and stopped just above the anticipated destination a playful 
smirk resting on her lips. 

Yuna groaned. &quot;Don&#39;t tease.&quot;

Paine chuckled. &quot;You&#39;re the one who stopped first.&quot; Paine inched her 
hand a little lower. Yuna growled in frustration and kissed Paine deeply 
and pushed Paine&#39;s hand down to let the warrior know what she wanted. 
Paine moaned softly into the kiss and complied with Yuna&#39;s demands and 
slipped 2 fingers in and brought the ex-summoner to her knees as her 
fevered cries were silenced by a deep kiss from Paine. &quot;We better get 
going before they realize what&#39;s taking us so long.&quot;

Yuna smiled at Paine. &quot;Yea let&#39;s go.&quot;

The two girls got dressed slowly and as they exited the shower room 
Paine leaned in and kissed Yuna softly. &quot;You&#39;re back at 100 so you 
know.&quot;

Yuna smiled. &quot;So are you.&quot;       

Paine and Yuna walked out of the shower room and Paine stretched as they 
walked down the hall towards the bridge. Rikku came running out the door 
of the bridge and ran smack into Paine who wrapped her arms around Rikku 
to keep her from falling. &quot;Where&#39;s the fire Rikku?&quot;

Rikku struggled a bit and tried to get out of Paine&#39;s hold but Paine 
simply held her tighter. &quot;Let me go!&quot; Rikku squirmed more and seeing 
that it was finally Paine she stopped and wrapped her arms around her 
and cried hard burring her face in the older girl&#39;s neck.

Paine looked at Yuna who in turn nodded and stomped onto the bridge. 
Paine held Rikku as she cried rubbing her back every now and then. 
&quot;Rikku what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

Rikku sobbed a few times then looked up at Paine. &quot;You don&#39;t hate me do 
you?&quot; 

Paine gave Rikku a funny look. &quot;No Rikku I don&#39;t. Why who said I did?&quot;

Rikku hugged Paine tight. &quot;Brother...he said it&#39;s all my fault you hate 
me.&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Paine&#39;s red eyes narrowed at the bridge door. Paine let go 
of Rikku and walked into the bridge Rikku at her heals. A slight growl 
exited Paine&#39;s lips as she looked at Brother. Yuna&#39;s eyes got wide when 
she saw Paine walk up behind Brother and tap him on the shoulder. 
Brother turned around and looked into the cold crimson eyes of the 
warrior. &quot;You&#39;re about to be hurt...&quot; Before anyone could react Paine 
had Brother up against a wall his feet inches off the floor. 

&quot;Paine!&quot; Rikku&#39;s eyes got wide as she looked at her friend.

Paine looked over her shoulder at Rikku and then back at Brother and 
growled. &quot;You ever make her cry like that again and no one will be able 
to stop me got it.&quot; Paine let Brother go and pushed him against the wall 
before exiting the air ship. Paine walked along the beach and walked to 
the end of the empty pier and looked out over the horizon.

Yuna and Rikku stood on the beach of Besaide and sighed softly before 
looking for their friend. Rikku saw her first. &quot;Yunie look.&quot;

&quot;What is it Rikku...?&quot; Yuna saw Paine standing on the end of the pier 
arms down at her sides as the cool morning breeze blew through her 
silver hair, her head neither hung nor held high, her gaze locked on the 
horizon, though not seen by Yuna or Rikku her cheeks glistened with shed 
tears. &quot;Paine...&quot; Yuna breathed.

&quot;You think she&#39;s ok Yunie?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know Rikku...I&#39;ve never seen her that mad before. The look on 
her face was nothing I&#39;ve seen before...So much anger and pain in one 
look...&quot;

&quot;Should we go talk to her?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s just make sure she&#39;s ok and then we&#39;ll leave her alone for 
awhile.&quot;

Rikku nodded and the two girls approached Paine slowly. Paine heard them 
coming up behind her and wiped away any proof of any emotion she had 
shown. Upon hearing the footsteps stop Paine spoke in her usual 
emotionless tone. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I lost it like that.&quot;

Rikku smiled a bit. &quot;Its ok Paine thanks though it&#39;s nice to know I have 
a friend that cares about me.&quot;

Yuna smiled a bit. &quot;Are you ok Paine? I mean I&#39;ve never seen you that 
mad before.&quot;

Her tone never changing Paine spoke. &quot;My father, whenever he was drunk, 
which was quite often, would beat my mother or me, whoever was there at 
the time, so I started training with the sword and mastering my fighting 
skills and one night when I got home my mother ran to me and cried 
telling me to leave because my father was drunk again. And he told her 
the same thing Brother told Rikku today. He told my mother it was her 
fault I hated her.&quot; Paine sighed. &quot;All I could think of when Rikku asked 
me if I hated her was that night.&quot; Paine took a deep breath and hung her 
head. &quot;That was the last night I ever saw my mother.&quot;

Rikku looked at Paine then at Yuna and then back at Paine. &quot;Paine...I&#39;m 
so sorry...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be sorry Rikku, and if I ever did anything to make you think I 
hated you I&#39;m sorry.&quot; 

Rikku took a few steps closer to her friend and put a hand on her 
shoulder and turned her around and wrapped her in a hug. &quot;No Paine you 
didn&#39;t...that&#39;s what made what Brother said so hurtful.&quot;

Paine nodded and hugged Rikku back softly. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to scare you.&quot;

&quot;Its ok don&#39;t worry about it ok.&quot; Rikku giggled a little and looked at 
Yuna who had tears on her cheek. &quot;Yunie are you ok?&quot;

Yuna simply looked at Paine and then at her boots. &quot;Yuna don&#39;t cry...&quot; 
Paine walked over to Yuna and pulled her into hug. &quot;I&#39;m gonna stop 
sharing things about my past with you if you keep crying every time I 
do.&quot; 

Yuna looked up at her. &quot;No please Paine I want to know you. I&#39;m sorry I 
shouldn&#39;t be crying.&quot;

Tidus saw the girls standing on the pier and ran over. &quot;Remind me not to 
get on your bad side ok.&quot; Tidus looked over at Yuna and Rikku. &quot;I&#39;m 
warning you now Brother is pissed, I mean Buddy and I are on Paine&#39;s 
side and the lil guy says he&#39;s not getting involved.&quot;

Rikku narrowed her eyes. &quot;What are you saying?&quot;

Tidus took a deep breath and sighed. &quot;He wants Paine out.&quot;

&quot;What!&quot; Rikku looked at Tidus then at Yuna and Paine.

Paine smirked. &quot;Fine, go back and tell him I&#39;ll be right there to get my 
stuff, and tell him I better not ever see or hear from him again or he&#39;s 
hurt.&quot;

&quot;Paine you can&#39;t...&quot; Yuna looked at Paine and her eyes teared up.

Paine offered her a soft smile. &quot;Don&#39;t cry Yuna I figured this would 
happen.&quot;

&quot;I hope he knows if you go I go.&quot; Yuna put her hands on her hips and 
turned a serious gaze towards the air ship.

Rikku bounced up and down. &quot;Yea me too.&quot;

&quot;You guys don&#39;t have to...&quot;

&quot;We know we don&#39;t have to Paine. We want to.&quot; Yuna kissed Paine softly 
on the cheek. &quot;Let&#39;s go get our stuff.&quot;

The three girls walked onto the air ship and went straight to the cabin. 
Paine pulled a black duffel bag out from under her bed and tossed her 
stuff in it. Yuna and Rikku did the same before walking out of the cabin 
the girls all put their communicators on their bed and as they were 
leaving Buddy walked out of the bridge. &quot;I told him if Paine went you 
two went to and he didn&#39;t seem care. Hey look if you 3 are gone so am I. 
I ain&#39;t staying here after today. I was on my way out before you three 
joined up. I&#39;ll catch up to you guys on the island ok. Take care.&quot;

The girls nodded and exited the air ship. Paine sighed a bit and looked 
at her two friends. &quot;You guys want some help with those?&quot; 

Yuna smiled and shook her head no. &quot;We can manage thank you though 
Paine.&quot;

Paine offered a nod and the three girls headed for the village. Lulu was 
just walking out of her hut when she saw the three walking into the 
village. &quot;Yuna?&quot; The black mage walked towards them and the smile that 
tugged at her lips soon disappeared. &quot;Yuna what are you guys doing 
here?&quot;

Yuna offered a soft smile. &quot;It&#39;s a long story Lulu.&quot;

Paine simply shook her head. &quot;Let&#39;s just say Brother crossed the line 
and I threatened him and ended up getting the boot and they said if I go 
they go so.&quot;

Lulu nodded. &quot;Here there&#39;s an empty hut over here.&quot; The mage took the 
girls to a nice sized hut the three could easily fit in comfortably and 
pulled up the vacant sign and smiled at them. &quot;I told you before Paine 
for life.&quot;

Paine nodded. &quot;Yea.&quot; Paine sighed heavily and dropped her duffel bag on 
the empty bed and flopped down and took a sudden interest in her boots. 

Yuna looked at Paine and squatted down in front of her and cocked her 
head to the side to look at Paine. &quot;Whats up with the sudden interest in 
your boots?&quot;

Paine cracked a small smile and looked at Yuna. &quot;Whats your sudden 
interest in sitting on the floor?&quot;

Yuna smiled and stood up and sat down on the bed next to Paine. &quot;Hey 
come on now cheer up now we chose to go with you.&quot;

Paine looked over at Yuna and shook her head. &quot;I take it you guys are 
gonna want to stay on Besaide.&quot;

Yuna smiled. &quot;No actually I don&#39;t. I want to start a new life you know 
I&#39;m sick of hiding the fact I&#39;m half Al Bhed.&quot;

Paine shrugged. &quot;Then quit.&quot;

Rikku smiled. &quot;Well how about Bikinal Desert?&quot; Rikku bounced up and 
down. &quot;We can still be spear hunters girls. Good bye Gullwings hello 
YRP!&quot;

Paine smiled softly and stood up and rested an arm on Rikku&#39;s shoulder. 
&quot;Well we got the RP what about you Yuna?&quot;

Yuna stood and put and arm on Paine&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Y is definitely in.&quot;

Rikku giggled. &quot;Then that&#39;s that we are now officially YRP!&quot; Rikku 
bounced a little as she stood there putting her left arm straight out in 
front of her. Paine smirked and put her leather clad hand over Rikku&#39;s. 
Yuna smiled and placed her hand over Paine&#39;s. &quot;That it then YRP forever 
girls.&quot; Rikku smiled more. &quot;In the morning we head for Djose Gipple can 
give us a lift to Bikinal.&quot; 

Paine smirked. &quot;Tattoo&#39;s anyone?&quot;

Yuna playfully swatted Paine&#39;s arm. &quot;Hello ouch pain.&quot;

Paine laughed. &quot;What did I do?&quot;

Yuna shook her head. &quot;Not the pain I meant.&quot;

Rikku smiled hearing the usually unemotional girl laugh. &quot;Why not? Come 
on Yunie it will be cool all three of us with an emblem ya know kinda 
like YRP&#39;s symbol.&quot;

&quot;And just what do you suggest for a symbol Rikku?&quot; Yuna looked at her 
cousin and cocked her head to one side.

&quot;Um ask Paine it was her idea.&quot; Rikku giggled nervously and looked at 
Paine.

Lulu smiled softly. &quot;Ok you three after you get settled in meet me and 
Wakka for lunch at the caf&eacute; below the temple ok.&quot; The three girls nodded 
and the black mage took her leave.

Paine blinked a few times and went to her bag pulled out a pencil and a 
pad of paper and sat down on her bed resting against the head board and 
started to sketch. Yuna and Rikku both shrugged a bit and sat on Rikku&#39;s 
bed and talked while Paine sketched. &quot;Ha perfect.&quot; Paine closed the 
sketch book and started to put her stuff back in her bag leaving the 
sketch book on her bed. Paine kept slapping the hands of a certain 
blonde Al Bhed thief who kept trying to peek. &quot;Rikku you try to peek on 
more time you&#39;ll lose 5 points, and if you try to get Yuna to peek for 
you its 10 points.&quot;

&quot;Come on Paine I wanna see.&quot; Rikku whined

&quot;I&#39;ll show you guys after we meet up with Lulu and Wakka.&quot; 

&quot;Not fair we want to see it now.&quot; Rikku pouted.

Paine finally gave in. &quot;You guys really want to see it that bad huh.&quot; 
Rikku and Yuna nodded and Paine just shook her head and sat between 
them. &quot;Ok but just to warn you this is just a sketch if you guys like it 
I&#39;ll clean it up finalize it and we can go get it.&quot; Paine opened up the 
sketch book to a picture she sketched of Yuna and Rikku sitting at the 
bar on the Celsius and quickly flipped the page to the right one. In the 
center of page was what looked like eyes with an open heart over them 
and a triangle all together and wavy.

  

Paine looked between her friends and back at the picture. &quot;So what do 
you think?&quot;

Rikku smiled. &quot;Its cool but I wanna see that picture of me and Yunie you 
drew.&quot;

Paine blushed a bit. &quot;Uh which one? There&#39;s like 3 of both of you and 
like 2 of each of you.&quot; 

Yuna smiled and winked at Rikku. &quot;How about all of them?&quot;

Paine looked at her two friends and shook her head. &quot;How bout later huh 
Lulu and Wakka are waiting for us.&quot;

&quot;Come on Paine please show us before we go.&quot; Yuna trailed her fingers up 
and down the back of Paine&#39;s neck every now and then twirling the silky 
strands of silver hair around her finger.

Paine closed her eyes and took a deep breath. &quot;Ok, ok you win here.&quot; 
Paine handed Yuna her sketch book. &quot;Just keep in mind they are only 
sketches I haven&#39;t cleaned them up and colored them yet.&quot;

Yuna smiled and nodded and opened the sketch book and looked at the 
pictures with Rikku looking over her shoulder. &quot;Paine these are really 
good. I never knew you could draw.&quot;

Paine smiled a bit. &quot;Yea well it&#39;s not one of my better talents.&quot;

Rikku stuck her tongue out at Paine. &quot;Shut up these are great.&quot;

&quot;Whatever you say Rikku.&quot; Paine stood from the bed and walked towards 
the open flap of the hut. She stood in the doorway and sighed softly 
before looking back over her shoulder at her friends. &quot;You guys about 
ready to go?&quot;

Yuna smiled. &quot;Yea were ready let&#39;s go Rikku.&quot;

The three girls walked to the caf&eacute; and sat down with Lulu, Wakka and 
Vidina. Yuna and Rikku offered bright smiles at their friends and Paine 
simply nodded feeling a little out of place. Lulu smiled a bit and gave 
Paine a soft smile sensing her discomfort. &quot;You don&#39;t have to feel out 
of sorts here any friend of Yuna&#39;s is a friend of mine so please don&#39;t 
feel weird.&quot; Paine offered a small smile and a slight nod. The five sat 
and ate and talked for a while before they went their separate ways. 

Yuna and Rikku went for a walk on the beach while Paine went back to the 
hut and cleaned up the sketches in her sketch book and colored them. 
Yuna and Rikku walked back in to the hut after the sun went down and 
Paine was just finishing up the last picture of Yuna. &quot;Paine why didn&#39;t 
you come with us?&quot;

&quot;Busy.&quot; Paine never looked up and continued to color.

Rikku snickered. &quot;Getting busy without Yunie huh?&quot;

Paine sighed in annoyment. &quot;Fuck you Rikku.&quot; A slight chuckle was 
uttered as she spoke. 

Yuna chuckled at the expression that sat on Paine&#39;s face. &quot;So what had 
you so busy that you didn&#39;t walk with us huh?&quot; Yuna sat on the bed next 
to Paine and ran a finger up and down her arm.

&quot;This.&quot; Paine turned the picture of Yuna towards the summoner and 
blushed a bit. &quot;It&#39;s not quite done but I finished the picture of the 
tattoo if you guys want to see it.&quot; 

Rikku bounced over to the bed and sat on the other side of Paine. &quot;Ok 
let&#39;s see it.&quot; Paine flipped to the finished sketch of the tattoo and 
smiled a bit when she saw Rikku&#39;s and Yuna&#39;s reaction. &quot;Paine this is 
great. We can leave it just like that too it&#39;s perfect.&quot; 

Rikku yawned and stretched. &quot;I don&#39;t know about you guys but its been a 
long day and I&#39;m beat, so I&#39;m going to sleep.&quot; Rikku walked across the 
room to her bed and flopped down a soft moan escaping her lips.  

Yuna leaned over and kissed Paine&#39;s neck softly. &quot;Walk with me on the 
beach.&quot;

Paine looked at Yuna out of the corner of her eye and smirked while 
leaning in and whispering in her ear as she did she wrapped one arm 
around Yuna&#39;s waist. &quot;You want more then just a walk on the beach I&#39;m 
sure.&quot; 

Yuna leaned into Paine and smiled a bit. &quot;Mmmmmhmmm.&quot; Yuna placed a hand 
over Paine&#39;s and turned her head and kissed Paine softly. &quot;Please...&quot; 
Yuna breathed.

Paine nodded a bit and with her free hand removed her sketch book from 
her lap and her and Yuna stood, Paine&#39;s arm still around her waist her 
body now directly behind Yuna&#39;s. Paine smirked a bit and leaned in and 
kissed Yuna&#39;s neck speaking softly. &quot;Do we really have to go to the 
beach?&quot;

Yuna chuckled. &quot;Yes we do. Rikku would kill us.&quot;

Paine chuckled. &quot;True.&quot; 

Yuna now stood next to Paine with her finger entwined with Paine&#39;s and 
the two walked from the hut closing the flap behind them. The two talked 
softly as they walked to the beach. &quot;Are you sure you want all of Spira 
to know that the high summoner is half Al Bhed? I mean I don&#39;t care who 
knows that I&#39;m half Al Bhed, but you&#39;re the high summoner.&quot;

Yuna smiled. &quot;I&#39;m an ex-summoner remember I&#39;m a spear hunter now so I 
don&#39;t care what Spira thinks of me. All I care about is what you and 
Rikku think of me no one else matters to me.&quot; Yuna squeezed Paine&#39;s hand 
a little and smiled a bit.

Paine returned the squeeze and smiled and stopped walking and her and 
Yuna stood in a small circle of moonlight and Paine pulled Yuna to her 
and leaned in like she was going to kiss her but stopped short and spoke 
softly. &quot;I think the world of you Yuna and nothing you chose to do will 
change that.&quot; Paine then kissed the shorter girl softly. 

Yuna kissed Paine back deeply letting her hands explore Paine&#39;s body 
quickly undoing the belts around the warrior&#39;s mid-section and letting 
them fall to the sand, Yuna then unclasped the skull belt letting it 
fall to the sand with the other two. Paine smirked and undid Yuna&#39;s chap 
letting it fall as her red decretive belt hit the sand next. The next 
thing to hit the sand was the studded leather that was wrapped around 
Paine&#39;s chest. The two broke for air and Paine smirked and removed 
Yuna&#39;s shirt after Yuna pulled her gloves off. Yuna chuckled slightly. 
&quot;D&eacute;j&agrave; vu.&quot;

Paine chuckled. &quot;You know it&#39;s not as hard as it looks to take off.&quot; 
Paine pulled Yuna to her and kisses along her neck trailing her hands 
down her sides and unbuttoned her shorts. Yuna pressed her bare chest 
into Paine&#39;s as Paine slid her hand into Yuna&#39;s thong and pet her 
softly. Yuna moaned softly as Paine teasingly moved her lips away from 
Yuna as Yuna leaned in to kiss her as Paine slipped 2 fingers in slowly. 

Yuna gasped and looked into the crimson eyes of her warrior and pleaded. 
&quot;Please Paine...&quot; Yuna breathed.

Paine smirked a bit and leaned in closer and then stopped teasingly. 
&quot;You are so beautiful...&quot; At that Paine leaned in and kissed Yuna deeply 
laying her down in the cool sand and before long had the summoner 
panting and yelling her name. The two walked back to the hut and spoke 
softly as they walked. &quot;You know when we finally get to Bikinal we&#39;ll 
get a home with separate rooms so we don&#39;t have hide and I&#39;ll defiantly 
make it a night to remember.&quot;

Yuna smiled. &quot;I kind of like our secret rendezvous.&quot;

Paine smirked a bit. &quot;Well they are hell on my ego. I never knew I was 
this shy till tonight.&quot;

Yuna laughed and pulled Paine to her and kissed her playfully. &quot;Awww 
poor baby.&quot; Yuna said teasingly and all of a sudden took off in a dead 
run down the beach. 

Paine chuckled and tore off down the beach after her. *Where does she 
get her energy?* Paine caught up to Yuna easy pulling her into her arms 
and holding her tightly around the waist, both girls breathing a bit 
heavy. &quot;You can run Yuna but you can&#39;t get away.&quot;

Yuna smiled. &quot;Who said I wanted to get away from you?&quot;

Paine returned the smile. &quot;Let&#39;s just go to bed huh?&quot; Yuna just nodded 
and took Paine&#39;s hand and they walked back to the hut and changed into 
their pajamas and crawled into Paine&#39;s bed. Yuna laid her head on 
Paine&#39;s chest and draped her arm over her stomach and happily drifted 
off to sleep. 

Rikku smiled when she woke up the next morning seeing her cousin in 
Paine&#39;s arms sleeping with a slight smile on her lips. &quot;I&#39;m glad you 
finally found who makes you happy Yunie.&quot; Rikku got a sly smile on her 
face and walked quietly over to Paine&#39;s bed and stood next to her trying 
hard to muffle her giggles. 

When Rikku reached for the covers Paine grabbed her arm. &quot;I told you 
Rikku you can&#39;t sneak up on me.&quot;

Rikku squeaked. &quot;How did you do that?&quot;  

Paine sat up with Yuna and winked at the blonde. &quot;Its something my 
mother taught me. And besides I&#39;m a rather light sleeper and you Rikku 
are a giggler.&quot;

Yuna laughed. &quot;That she is. Let&#39;s get dressed and head to Luca.&quot;

***********************************************************

The girls got off the boat in Luca and headed towards Djose stopping at 
the tattoo parlor. When they got there Gipple was waiting there with 
Buddy. &quot;Bout time you three showed up. I thought you ditched me for the 
beach.&quot;

Yuna smiled. &quot;Never Buddy. I&#39;m no longer going to hide the fact that I&#39;m 
half Al Bhed.&quot;

Buddy smiled. &quot;Rikku finally got you huh?&quot;

Yuna smiled and shook her head no. &quot;Actually I&#39;m taking Paine&#39;s advice.&quot;

Paine chuckled. &quot;Why are you dragging me into this?&quot; Paine shrugged her 
shoulders.

Gippel laughed and spoke in Al Bhed not knowing everyone there knew it. 
&quot;Kuut-poa rekr cissuhan ramm Al Bhed bnehlacc.&quot;*

Paine shook her head. &quot;Oui ryjahd lryhkat oui&#39;na cdemm yh ycc.&quot;

Gippel looked at Paine. &quot;No way you know the language.&quot;

Paine shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m half Al Bhed I better know the language.&quot;

Rikku simply hugged her boyfriend. &quot;Care to give us a lift to Bikinal?&quot;

Buddy looked at Rikku. &quot;No way you guys are going to live in Bikinal 
Desert. My girlfriend Trelyn lives there.&quot;

Paine&#39;s jaw dropped. &quot;Trelyn...short blonde hair, ice blue eyes, tattoo 
of a tiger on her right arm, Trelyn?&quot;

Buddy smiled. &quot;Yup that would be her.&quot;

&quot;Damn it, I grew up with her.&quot; Paine shrugged. &quot;Ah well she probably 
won&#39;t recognize me. I&#39;ve changed a lot since I&#39;ve seen her last.&quot; 

Yuna smiled softly at Paine and wrapped her arms around Paine&#39;s left 
arm. &quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll recognize you Paine you couldn&#39;t have changed all 
that much.&quot;

Paine chuckled. &quot;Yea I could have. For starters my hair used to be long 
and well the top half of my outfit sorta changed, and well I never wore 
the gloves before. If she does it will be a miracle.&quot;

Buddy smiled. &quot;Paine why don&#39;t you and the girls meet me at your old 
hang out tonight and bring the gil cuz we are gonna party. And you WILL 
dance tonight Paine.&quot;


Gippel: &quot;Good-bye high summoner hell Al Bhed princess&quot;

Paine: &quot;you haven&#39;t changed you&#39;re still an ass&quot;

&quot;Only if they play my song will I dance.&quot; Paine winked at Buddy. &quot;I&#39;ll 
have to teach Yuna the basics though before we go, and I&#39;m sure Rikku 
knows how to rave all Al Bhed know how to.&quot; 

Rikku bounced up and down. &quot;You better believe I know how. I used to go 
to the club all the time and watch these two girl&#39;s rave. They were 
good. The one who would tie the glow sticks to the ends of her braids 
was killer.&quot; Rikku looked at Paine and smirked. &quot;Now I know why I 
thought I&#39;ve seen you before when we first joined the Gullwings you&#39;re 
her, you&#39;re that girl.&quot;

Paine sighed. &quot;Yea well if it&#39;s taken you two years to realize that 
it&#39;ll take Trelyn longer.&quot;

Yuna looked at Paine. &quot;You dance? Now this I have to see.&quot;

Paine shook her head. &quot;I guess you will tonight.&quot; Paine flipped her 
bangs like she always did and looked over at Buddy. &quot;We&#39;ll see you 
tonight.&quot;

Rikku smiled. &quot;Yea come on patch my dear I wanna put my stuff away.&quot; 

Gippel smiled and motioned for the three girls to follow him. &quot;So now 
that your Al Bhed you still gonna be a spear hunter?&quot;

Yuna smiled. &quot;You bet. Buddy is staying on as our spear locator all we 
need is an airship and a pilot.&quot;

Gippel smiled. &quot;Well you&#39;re in luck the machine faction is fixing mine 
up so you now have a pilot an airship and a crew. Nadala is pretty handy 
when it comes analyzing spears, and take your pick for barkeep I mean we 
can get you your loyal hypello back, and whatever else you may need its 
yours just ask ok.&quot;

Yuna smiled. &quot;Thanks Gippel.&quot;

The four rode in silence to Bikinal Desert. Upon arriving in the desert 
Gippel walked the three girls to an empty house and smiled. &quot;Here you go 
hope you don&#39;t mind it&#39;s only a two bedroom.&quot;

Rikku smiled. &quot;Nope that&#39;s perfect now Yunie and Paine don&#39;t need to 
leave the place to have sex.&quot;

&quot;Watch it Rikku.&quot; Paine shook her head and looked at the young thief.

Yuna smirked. &quot;Guess that means you can have Gippel over to have sex 
with him and not hide the fact you are.&quot; Rikku blushed a deep crimson. 
&quot;I know what you did in Luca Rikku other than run that booth.&quot; Rikku 
blushed again. 

While everyone was picking on Rikku Paine walked into one of the rooms 
and set Rikku&#39;s bag down on the bed and then walked into the other room 
farther down the hall and set her&#39;s and Yuna&#39;s on the other. A soft sigh 
escaped her lips as she exited the room. Paine walked back out by 
everyone and chuckled. &quot;Well if we plan on getting to the club I really 
gotta get in the shower.&quot; Paine brushed the dust off her leather shorts 
and shook her head.

Yuna smiled. &quot;A shower sounds nice. Gippel you will be joining us 
tonight right?&quot;

&quot;You bet wouldn&#39;t miss your first night as an Al Bhed for the world.&quot;

Yuna smiled. &quot;Well if you two will excuse us we&#39;re going to take a 
shower.&quot;

***********************************************************

Yuna, Rikku, Paine, and Gippel walked into the Al Bhed club called Dra 
Enuh Vecd* and moved through the crowed of people dancing to the 
rave-trance music they had playing. Paine stopped at the bar and bout 4 
shots of Valti, a very strong Al Bhed whiskey, and a bunch of glow 
sticks. Yuna walked up and took the glow sticks off the bar and winked 
at Paine letting her carry the shots. They walked up to the table and 
Paine set the shots down on the table and after everyone had there&#39;s 
Yuna stood next to Paine and held her glass up. &quot;To starting over with 
old friends and new loves.&quot; Everyone raised their shot and then slung 
them. All except for Rikku who sipped at hers.

*The Iron Fist

Yuna coughed and Paine rubbed her back. &quot;Sorry I should have told you to 
sip that it&#39;s some pretty strong shit.&quot;

Yuna nodded a bit. &quot;You owe me.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough what do I owe you?&quot;

Yuna leaned in and kissed Paine&#39;s cheek. &quot;You have to dance with me all 
night because I have no idea how to dance like that.&quot; Yuna pointed to a 
few Al Bhed guys raveing.

Paine nodded. &quot;I can show you how Yuna it&#39;s not that hard once you get 
the hang of it.&quot; 

Rikku separated the glow sticks between her Yuna and Paine. She gave 
Yuna a blue and green one to match her eyes, Paine got the red and 
purple and Rikku took the other green one and yellow. Yuna slowly 
started to move her hips to a smooth trance song and smirked and pulled 
Paine to the dance floor and started to dance very provocatively. She 
wrapped her arms around Paine&#39;s neck and pressed up against the warrior 
and teasingly ran her hands down Paine&#39;s body as she fell to her knees 
and bent back and smiled at Buddy who was standing there smirking. She 
offered him a wink as Paine held her hand out and hauled Yuna to her 
feet. Paine blushed softly seeing Trelyn standing there. Trelyn smiled. 
&quot;I recognize those eyes anywhere Paine it&#39;s about time you resurfaced. 
What the hell did you do to your hair?&quot; 

Paine shook her head. &quot;Long story Tre. Yuna Trelyn, Trelyn EX-high 
summoner Yuna.&quot;

Trelyn smirked. &quot;Still popular with the ladies I see. The high summoner 
no less, very nice to meet you Lady Yuna.&quot;  

Yuna smiled. &quot;Please just call me Yuna.&quot;

Trelyn smiled. &quot;Yuna it is. So Paine you think you can still keep up 
with me? I told the d.j. to play our song next.&quot;

Paine smirked. &quot;The real question is can you still keep up with me?&quot;

Trelyn smiled. &quot;We&#39;ll see when our song is on won&#39;t we.&quot;

Paine nodded. &quot;Yes we will.&quot;

Yuna laughed. &quot;Well then you better give me my lesson then huh.&quot; Paine 
nodded. &quot;Rikku and Gippel are at a table if you want to go see them 
Buddy.&quot;

Paine pulled Yuna off to the side a bit and began to show Yuna the basic 
moves towards the end of the song Yuna wasn&#39;t watching Paine any longer 
and doing the moves on her own. The d.j. stopped the music and announced 
that they had a treat for them and announced Paine and Trelyn&#39;s return 
to the club and started up their song &quot;Liquid Sex&quot; Paine smirked and 
took Yuna&#39;s hand and walked out into the middle of the dance floor and 
smirked at Trelyn who was out there with Buddy. &quot;Yuna remember what we 
did ok because it&#39;ll go perfect to this song.&quot; Yuna nodded and the d.j. 
paused the song to announce Yuna&#39;s presence and restarted the song and 
let the four dance in the center of the group that had formed around 
them. Rikku and Gippel soon joined their friends in the center. By the 
end of the song everyone was breathing heavy and sweat glistened off 
their fresh tattoos. Paine picked Yuna up easily and kissed her before 
setting her down and leaning in to whisper in her ear. &quot;You were great 
out there.&quot; Yuna smiled and wrapped her arms around Paine&#39;s neck again 
and swayed her hips to the music straddling Paine&#39;s left leg kissing the 
warrior teasingly and finally not caring who was looking at them kissed 
the leather clad girl deeply on the lips running her tongue along 
Paine&#39;s and up out of her mouth only long enough to smile and then 
started the kiss again deeper this time their bodies and tongues moving 
to the music the kiss not stopping till after the song was over. 

Trelyn put a hand on Paine&#39;s bare shoulder and smiled breathing heavy. 
&quot;You win that round let me buy you a drink huh.&quot; Paine and Trelyn walked 
up to the bar and Yuna, Rikku, Gippel and Buddy went back to the table. 
&quot;So what are you drinking Paine?&quot;

Paine smiled. &quot;Valti.&quot;

&quot;Haven&#39;t changed one bit.&quot; 

The two girls walked back to the table and sat down. Yuna put her head 
on Paine&#39;s shoulder and cuddled her arm. Paine offered Yuna a soft smile 
and glanced over at Rikku and saw her kissing on Gippel&#39;s neck and shook 
her head. Yuna smirked. &quot;Looks like I won&#39;t be the only one getting some 
tonight.&quot; Paine just chuckled and shook her head. Yuna smiled and moved 
one of her hands to Paine&#39;s lap.

***********************************************************

Around 3 am Paine carried a very drunk Yuna into the house as Gippel 
carried a very drunk Rikku in. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be staying the night 
Gippel I&#39;ll see you in the morning.&quot; Paine started to walk down the hall 
and stopped and looked over her shoulder. &quot;Oh Rikku&#39;s room the first 
door on the right...or is it the left...ah well one of those is the 
bathroom and the other is Rikku&#39;s room, anyways night.&quot;

Gippel shook his head. &quot;Night.&quot;

Paine walked into her and Yuna&#39;s room and kicked the door closed behind 
her. She walked over and laid Yuna down on the bed and kissed her softly 
before putting their bags on the floor. Paine opened Yuna&#39;s and took out 
her powder blue flannel pants and a white spaghetti strap mid-drift 
shirt and set them to one side before removing a pair of black flannel 
pants and white muscle shirt from her own bag. Yuna sat up and leaned 
for her pajamas and fell over and just started to giggle which made 
Paine utter an amused chuckle. &quot;Here Yuna.&quot; Paine tossed Yuna her cloths 
causing the girl to jump.

&quot;What!?!&quot; Yuna looked around a bit dazed.

&quot;What, what?&quot; Paine looked at her confused

Yuna giggled drunkly. &quot;Nothing Paine you just scared me.&quot; 

Paine raised her left eyebrow. &quot;How?&quot; Paine shook her head. &quot;Nevermind 
you&#39;re drunk.&quot;

Yuna pouted. &quot;Its not like you&#39;re entirely sober yourself ya know.&quot;

Paine shrugged. &quot;Your point is?&quot; a playful smile sat of her lips.

Yuna got out of bed and ever so slowly removed her cloths and stood 
there for a second watching the blush creep onto Paine&#39;s cheeks. Yuna 
smirked. &quot;Mmmm like what you see?&quot; Paine simply nodded. Yuna walked over 
to Paine and smirked and leaned in and kissed her softly then even 
slower then she removed her cloths Yuna put on her pjs. 

Paine shook her head. &quot;Tease.&quot; Paine turned her back to Yuna and sat 
down on the bed and slowly removed her cloths making sure to go extra 
slow when she got to what Yuna could never get off and quickly slipped 
into her pjs. She stood and looked at a blushing Yuna. &quot;Told you it 
wasn&#39;t that hard.&quot;

Yuna furrowed her brow and looked at Paine. &quot;I never knew about that 
scar. May I ask how you got it?&quot;

Paine chuckled a bit. &quot;You never knew about it because it was covered 
and I got it when I bailed you guys out with that pack of killer hounds 
with the few lupuses in the mix.&quot;

Yuna looked at her funny. &quot;You never bled that day.&quot;

Paine simply winked at Yuna. &quot;Let&#39;s just go to bed ok.&quot; 

Yuna crawled into bed and cuddled up next to Paine resting her head on 
the warrior&#39;s chest. &quot;I love you...&quot; Yuna breathed as she fell asleep.

Paine smiled softly. &quot;I love you.&quot; Paine whispered back as she closed 
her eyes and drifted off to sleep holding Yuna.

***********************************************************

The sun rose slowly the next morning. The sunlight just barely shown 
through the closed blinds. Yuna uttered a soft groan as she rolled off 
Paine and stretched. Paine opened one eye feeling Yuna leave her arms. 
&quot;Morning Yuna.&quot; 

Yuna smiled as she sat up. &quot;Morning Paine.&quot;

Paine got out of bed and stretched cracking her neck as she sat back 
down on the edge of the bed. &quot;So whats on your to do list today?&quot;

Yuna smiled a bit. &quot;Other then you?&quot;

Paine chuckled. &quot;Yea other than me.&quot;
  
Yuna giggled. &quot;Well I would like to go see the progress on Gippel&#39;s air 
ship and find out how soon we can start spear hunting again.&quot;

Paine spoke to Yuna as she got dressed. &quot;Works for me.&quot;

Rikku walked slowly to her cousins and knocked on the Door and awaited 
permission to enter. Upon hearing her cousin tell her to come in Rikku 
opened the door and walked in and saw Paine and Yuna were both fully 
dressed. &quot;Gippel wants to know if you&#39;re up for a trip to Djose to get 
his airship.&quot;

Yuna smiled. &#39;You bet we are.&quot;

Rikku bounced. &quot;Let&#39;s go then come on YRP is about to go on its first 
spear hunt.&quot; Rikku bounded out of the room and waited for them in the 
front room.

Yuna looked at Paine. &quot;I&#39;m not leaving this room till you tell me how 
you got that scar if you never bled that day.&quot;

Paine smirked. &quot;I bled believe me, I just didn&#39;t let you and Rikku see 
is all. If you remember I disappeared after I helped you out. I mean it 
was after that I joined The Gullwings. The day you and Rikku joined was 
sorta a relief.&quot;

Yuna nodded slightly. &quot;Let&#39;s go then shall we?&quot;
