<h1>Not Really Second Best</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff102/index.html">Final Fantasy 10-2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alinagrech.html">Alina Grech</a><br> </h2>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It’s wrong to want your cousin 
and logically you know that. It doesn’t stop you from watching her 
when she isn’t looking nor does it stop you from daydreaming about 
what it would be like to have her look at you the way she was always 
looking at him. You know it will never happen and laugh bitterly when 
you have one of those brief moments of being a realist and admit that 
even your brother has more chance with her, and even he has only a sliver 
of hope.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">You can’t compete with a 
ghost, especially that of a first love. You want to hate him and the 
fact that he got to hold her and kiss her but despite the fact that 
he got her and you never will, he was your friend and you can’t bring 
yourself to hate him. Even if you can’t escape their epic love for 
each other as she has you gallivanting all over Spira looking for those 
stupid spheres.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">You know it isn’t him, can’t 
possibly be him because he was nothing more than a dream. You just don’t 
have the heart to point that out to her, not that she’d listen anyway. 
She’d ignore you the same way she ignores Paine and it hurts a little 
to think that a dream is more important to her than the people who are 
around and actually exist. You don’t mention that either because it 
sounds far too bitter even in your own head and she wouldn’t understand 
anyway.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Days have started to blend 
into each other and it’s all the same each day. Wake up and realise 
you still have feelings for Yuna followed by an uncomfortable breakfast 
as you try not to look at her and remember just what she was doing in 
your dream last night. You always run to the shower after that and no 
matter how long you take no one can complain that there isn’t any 
hot water left because you stopped using it after the third night and 
you only have cold showers now. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">You wish you could say that 
travelling to all the different towns is at least interesting enough 
to offer some variety, but it’s just not. You always go for one reason 
and that’s it, she’d never forgive you if you didn’t show support 
for her quest. You feel a little resentful that you have this obligation 
to make her feel better when you turn up nothing and hate even more 
that it’s a role that she forced on you. Then it’s an eventful, 
yet quiet on your part, dinner and no one comments on the fact that 
her disappointment is almost stifling. No one even notices that you 
don’t eat anymore.   </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">You’re sitting on your bed 
just sort of staring off into space when she enters the cabin and it’s 
such an everyday thing that you barely even acknowledge her presence 
until she’s standing in front of you. This is new and it grabs your 
attention immediately, worry rising at this deviation from the norm. 
In the back of your mind that little voice that won’t shut up notices 
how beautiful she looks in the low light.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Is anything wrong?” she 
asks and all you can do is stare at her. The fact that she noticed something 
other than her ‘inner turmoil’ surprises you. Then you feel bad 
because she’s here to make sure you’re alright and she doesn’t 
deserve your petty attitude.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“No, why would you think 
that?” You’re lying and you know that she knows that. You can see 
the disbelief written clearly across her face as well as the hurt which 
you try to ignore. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She just shakes her head then 
sighs and flops down on your bed beside you, “I think I want to take 
a break.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">You lie down beside her and 
just look at her for a moment. You don’t understand what she’s talking 
about, but then you rarely do because she’s always saying things that 
are really deep and meaningful and you’re the first to admit that 
you’re rather shallow and not as in touch with big issues as you should 
be. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“A break?” your confusion 
is evident in your voice and by your expression.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“From sphere hunting,” 
she confides, “I’m sick of always being disappointed. Why can’t 
I find him?”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She starts crying and you briefly 
consider jumping for joy. Then you feel guilty because she obviously 
needs you to be a friend and it’s extremely inappropriate to be dancing 
around in happiness when she’s all but given up on the love of her 
life. Instead you pull her in for a hug and ignore the way having her 
so close makes you feel all warm.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">You let her cry for what seems 
like hours but a quick check of the clock shows that it’s only been 
twenty minutes. She’s calmed down to just the occasional sniffle and 
you soothingly rub her back and it’s one hundred percent innocent 
because for once you’re not thinking of how attractive you find her 
or the way she makes you feel when she’s this close.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You remind me of him, you 
know?” she says softly and it hurts because she knew you first so 
you shouldn’t be reminding her of anyone and you almost say something 
but then she’s talking again, “you both have that carefree attitude 
and that quick, easy smile. I miss that silly over enthusiasm you both 
have. Sometimes I used to forget he wasn’t here because you were always 
as energetic but you’re not anymore and I don’t understand why you 
won’t tell me what’s wrong”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">You’re confused. The conversation 
has taken a few too many turns for your mind to keep up and all you 
get from it is the hurt from being compared to him and the guilt and 
anger her concern for you instils. You think it’s unfair that even 
now everything is about him. The only reason she noticed anything is 
because you’re no longer behaving like <i>him </i>
and despite what you thought earlier, you really do hate him at this 
moment because he’s even taken this away from you. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I just don’t like seeing 
you so sad Yunie” you lie and feel a little nauseous at how effortless 
lying to her has become.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She looks at you as if she’s 
trying to determine the truth of your words. You know the exact moment 
that she sees through your excuse as hurt, followed by anger, flashes 
in her eyes and settles across her face. She pulls away from you and 
then stands up.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Don’t lie to me” her 
voice is barely louder than a whisper but the message and feeling is 
as loud as ever. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Instead of giving her the answers 
she wants you ask her a question that’s been on your mind since she 
started making comparisons between you and <i>him, </i>
“Do I look like him too?” you don’t want to hear the answer, not 
really, but you have to. You know that if she says yes you won’t be 
able to stay knowing that she doesn’t see <i>you </i>

anymore; that you don’t really exist for her anymore.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“What? Why would you ask 
that?” she seems both offended and confused, as if she doesn’t even 
realise that she just spent the last ten minutes comparing you to a 
dead man.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Well I mean everything else 
is the same to you so I’m wondering if I look like him as well” 
you know on some level that you’re probably being unfair to her bringing 
this up now while she’s so visibly upset but you don’t care. All 
you care about is how unfair she’s been to you over the months, using 
you as some sort of emotional crutch.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“A little but what...” 
she starts but you cut her off.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“So when did I stop being 
me in your mind and start being a poor replacement for <i>him</i>?” 
you can’t even bring yourself to say his name out loud.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“That’s...you’re not...” 
she has trouble forming a reply and to you that indicates her answer 
louder than anything she could actually say at this point.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I love you, more than I 
should really because I’m actually <i>in</i> love with you. I have 
been for years, since we were kids and I understood that you would never 
feel the same. But we were still family you know? I still mattered even 
if it wasn’t as much as I wanted,” you move away and head to the 
stairs, “I don’t matter anymore. You’ve made me into this person 
in your mind and I’ll never be him Yunie, but I can’t be me either.” 
You laugh bitterly inside and think that it’s a perfect time to finally 
sound like you have depth and substance. She doesn’t try to stop you 
as you leave the cabin and you don’t look back. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When you get to the bridge 
your eyes are dry but they are so red and puffy that even Brother picks 
up on the fact that you’ve been crying. It takes you a couple of tries 
but you finally manage to tell him that you want to leave. You don’t 
have a real plan but you tell Brother to take you to Djose temple. Gippal 
has always made you feel welcome, and who better to help you forget 
about her?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">You stay away from the cabin 
where she decided to stay and wait while Buddy changes course. You don’t 
think you could go through with leaving if you see her so you remain 
on the bridge and ignore Brother as he tries to talk you out of leaving. 
Several times you almost give in but you think about Yuna and all the 
comparisons, and all the hurt and it reminds you that leaving is the 
only option.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">For the first time in years 
Brother actually hugs you. You think you even see a tear before he says 
goodbye and heads back on board the Celsius. He’s the only one who 
came to see you off so you turn and walk to the temple.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Gippal meets you half way and 
asks what’s wrong, “It’s not that I mind having you around to 
help out. Just wondering why you’re here and not there.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It’s not even like he’s 
said something to really remind you of how tragic your life is now, 
but you find yourself breaking down and crying in the middle of the 
road. Amongst all the hysterical sobs you hear him walk up to you and 
for a second just his presence is comforting.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“He was the replacement,” 
says a voice so achingly familiar and you realise that it wasn’t Gippal 
that had approached you.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">You don’t look up and you 
don’t really hear what she said. All you can think is about is that 
she won’t even let you leave in peace. You barely even notice when 
she sits down beside you, or when she gently takes one of your hands 
from your face and just holds it.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Don’t leave,” she says, 
voice breaking, “please don’t leave me”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">You just look at her, hoping 
that something shows in her face to give you a clue as to why she’s 
doing this to you. You see nothing but honesty and that does nothing 
to answer the questions raging through your mind. Something must show 
in your expression as you roughly pull your hand from hers because she 
continues to speak.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You were <i>never</i> the 
replacement. It was never about the similarities you had to Tidus,” 
you flinch as she says his name, “it’s always been about the things 
he did or said that reminded me of you.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It makes no sense to you. Well 
it does but you don’t know how she could be saying these things. She 
was so in love with him that it showed in everything she did. You say 
as much to her and tears start to well in her eyes.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I’m so sorry,” she’s 
openly crying now and you fight the urge to comfort her because you 
hurt too and nothing she’s said has made you feel any different. You’re 
ignoring the faint spark of hope that had sprung up when you first heard 
her voice; it’s irrelevant, until she leans over and kisses you.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I loved you from the moment 
I could put a name to what I was feeling. I didn’t think you could 
ever feel the same way, not just because we’re both girls, but because 
you were just so full of life and I was so quiet. I didn’t want to 
hold you back.” She says and takes your face between her hands. Holds 
you there to make sure you listen to what she’s trying to say.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“But you said...and he...you” 
you’re at a loss for what to say. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I love you and I’m sorry, 
for so many things. But mostly for making you think you weren’t important. 
You will always be the most important person in my life Rikku and you 
will never be a replacement in my mind.” She declares and kisses you 
again. It’s rough and desperate, like she’s trying to convey everything 
in this one moment and you can feel the hurt ease. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It doesn’t make things automatically 
better but you think that so long as she keeps looking at you like you’re 
her entire world it may eventually sort itself out. You can do this 
you think, so long as she stays by your side and you do it together. </font> <br>
