<h1>Never Again Will I Slip (part 2 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff102/index.html">Final Fantasy 10-2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jessvolk.html">Jessicka Volkinivia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff102/nevagain-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Paine had often forced herself to think about the bad things that had 
happened in her life.

Thinking so hard about it, until she could think about it with a 
straight face and a silent heart.

She began thinking about the time that Rikku had tied her sword to the 
tip of the airship.

That one had sent Paine&#39;s heart racing.

They had been in the woods the day before and her mind immediately 
raced, thinking maybe she had lost it in a fight in the woods.

She searched the beds frantically in an attempt to find it.

Rikku had drug Yuna down the stairs early, before Paine had awakened, 
saying that Brother had been meaning to tell her about a sphere that 
left no doubt that Tidus was alive.

Well...you know Yuna and how much she cares for him, so of course she 
jumped at the opportunity.

When Paine had awakened, she rubbed her eyes sleepily and reached under 
her bed for her sword...only..grabbing...well...air...nothing at all.

Her heart stopped for a moment and then it began racing, as she searched 
around the bed, and under them in a failed attempt to find her sword.

The sword was like a lover to her, that she always kept close by.

She rubbed her face and sighed, punching the floor hard, before 
beginning to search for her clothes as well.

When they weren&#39;t where she had left them, then she really began to 
worry.

She was clad in a black thong and a haltertop...not exactly something 
she wanted to show off to the public.

With that she slowly tiptoed down the steps and sneaked around slowly, 
trying her damnest to avoid anyone on the airship.

She continued to search and somehow, found herself on the deck of the 
airship.

As she looked up she spotted her sword, about 25 feet in the air, on the 
flagpole like thing on the airship.

She walked up to the pole and looked around...thankful the sun hadnt 
rose yet and began to climb, up...and up...and up...and up some more.

Unknown to her, Rikku had been hiding in a little corner near the door 
to the deck and had taken zoomed in snapshots of Paine climbing the 
pole.

Then blew it up and posted it around all over the Celcius, and captioned 
it with lewd comments about Paine being a &quot;pole rider&quot; or something 
along the lines of a &quot;striper&quot; and &quot;pole dancer&quot;

None of the crew ever looked at her the same way again.

They always gave her lewd looks or smirks, which she promptly glared at 
them with a look on her face that read &quot;Hurt time!&quot;

Paine continuosly ran the event over in her mind, until she felt, 
neither hurt...nor upset.

After running the event over in her mind for days and weeks, and even 
months, she realized that she felt nothing of that event..no 
hurt...sadness...not...anger...no nothing..she felt nothing at all about 
that event...succeding in emotionally detaching herself from one event 
she slowly went on to the next one.</pre>
