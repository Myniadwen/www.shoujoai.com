<a href="../ff102/nevagain-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>After Paine had emotionally detached herself from all the events, she 
laid back down on her and sighed softly, running her fingers through her 
silver hair. She looked at the fireplace that was now nothing but soot 
and covered her eyes with the back of her hand. &quot;Guess it&#39;s time to get 
more firewood.

She kicked her feet over the side of her bed and grabbed her giant 
battle axe off the floor. She always had to buy the biggest things to do 
the smallest jobs..

She picked it up and swung it around a few time with her left hand, the 
one she was strongest in.

The thing must have weighed at least 50-75 pounds, but through rigorous 
training that she had forced herself through, she was able to manipulate 
it with one hand. It felt almost, light as a feather to her now. Whereas 
the weeks and months prior, she could barely lift it two inches off the 
ground.

She fetched her rucksack, holding only a cateen of water and a large 
slab of cooked Coyote meat and head out the door.

Paine began her trek into the woods, following the same path as she 
always did: Walk a hundred yard into the woods, chop the tree on the 
left down, dodge out of the way as it toppled. Chop it into 20 equal 
pieces and carry 4 back to the house each time.

After that was done she took a swig of her water from the cateen and 
stretched her muscles a bit before venturing in her path to get more 
food. That one slab of cooked Coyote meat would last a few days at the 
most. Small as she was, she could eat enough for all of New Yevon, the 
Machine Faction and the Youth League when she hadn&#39;t eaten in a while. 
Though she knew as a warrior, she could not allow herself to go too long 
without food or water. Then another thought hit her. She could make a 
keg of water out of some of the wood. So...with that being thought, she 
began to get to work.

After she was done she went out and picked some thick leaves, grabbed 
some rocks and went back to her log cabin. She postioned the leaves 
inbetween the pieces of logs to create a binding effect, then laid the 
logs on their sides. She then sparked the rocks on the leaves and melted 
the leaves into the wood, to bind it together. She did this on all sides 
of the keg until it was completed.

Paine sat down and took a bite out of the Coyote meat. Hey, it wasn&#39;t a 
Double Whopper w/everything on it, but at least it kept her strength up. 
She finished chewing the bit of Coyote meat she had bitten off and 
stood, grabbing her sword and set off to do some Coyote slaying...</pre>
