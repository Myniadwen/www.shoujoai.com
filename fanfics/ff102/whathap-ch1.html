<h1>What Happened on Besaid</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff102/index.html">Final Fantasy 10-2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/aniperve.html">Aniperve</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The wind blew through my hair as I sat on the deck of the Celsius. This 
is when I usually trained, but there was a thousand things occupying my 
mind at the moment. You know, things like where our next mission was 
going to be and who were we going to meet that Yuna&#39;s met on her earlier 
travels as a summoner.

But there was one thing that stood out in my mind. A young, blonde thief 
by the name of Rikku. I don&#39;t know why, but lately I haven&#39;t been able 
to get her out of my head for the last couple of days. It&#39;s weird. All 
the things she does, like call me Dr. P and the way she is so energetic, 
it&#39;s usually the stuff I&#39;d hate a person for, but with Rikku, I find it. 
Well. Kind of adorable actually, but I can&#39;t let her know that.

This might have started a week ago in Besaid, when Yuna and Rikku 
decided to check up on Lulu and Wakka. I didn&#39;t want to go because there 
was other things I wanted to do, but Rikku begged me to go and gave me 
the cutest smile in the world. &quot;Cute&quot;? Did I just use the word &quot;cute&quot;? 
Anyway, I went, but it might have been the biggest mistake of my life. I 
can&#39;t remember a time when I embarrassed my self so much!

-A week earlier in Besaid Village-

&quot;Hey look who it is, yah?&quot; Wakka said in his island accent. 
&quot;Whatsamatta? Forgot something from your last visit?&quot;

&quot;Do we need a reason to visit our favourite Blitzball player?&quot; Rikku 
said so sweetly. Yuna cleared her throat which got Rikku&#39;s attention. 
&quot;Sorry. Me and Paine&#39;s favourite Blitzball player!&quot;

That&#39;s right, I forgot Yuna&#39;s blonde-surfer dude used to be a Blitzball 
player. She kept telling us about him. It was like a broken record where 
we had to listen to it over and over again! I mean, c&#39;mon! I can only 
take so much! Anyway, after we met up with Wakka we decided to see where 
Lulu was at. Lulu looked happy to see we were there. She greeted us with 
a friendly. &quot;How have you all been?&quot; Yuna and Rikku said they were ok 
but I had something else to say.

&quot;Drec ec y lusbmada fycda uv so desa!&quot; I said in a low mumbling voice. I 
learned how to speak Al Bhed a long time ago and I used it whenever I 
didn&#39;t want people to know what I was saying.

Unfortunately, Rikku heard me a replied with a quick, &quot;Cdub paehk cilr y 
byndo buuban Painey!&quot; I rolled my eyes at hearing this. Me? A party 
pooper? It&#39;s not like I&#39;ve never been called that in my life. Still it 
was weird that she called me &quot;Painey&quot;. I blushed a bit at hearing her 
call me this but stopped before anyone noticed.

Lulu took Yuna aside and started talking to her. Yuna came back and said 
to Rikku and I, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I have to leave for a little while.&quot; 
Then Lulu escorted Yuna out of the hut.

I just stood there, wondering what I should do with the time between now 
and the time when Yuna returned. But I suddenly felt like someone was 
staring at me. So I turned around and there she was. Rikku was looking 
at me with a smirk. What&#39;s she up to? I thought to myself. Rikku walked 
up to me and batted her eyes. I started feeling weird inside, but I just 
shook it off and asked, &quot;What?&quot; in my usual monotone voice.

Rikku gave me that smile again. That cute one that convinced me to come 
to this stupid island in the first place! Then she said, &quot;You wanna do 
something while we wait for Yunie?&quot; I was now officially intrigued.

&quot;What kind of something?&quot; I asked without sounding like I was 
interested. Then, she started doing the strangest things.

She walked up even closer to me with a seductive look in her eyes. I 
fought back a blush. Then, she put her arms around my neck and got even 
closer to my face. It was harder, but I managed to stop a larger, second 
blush. But, then she brought her lips up to my ears as if she was going 
to whisper something. Now, there was no way my face could have been its 
normal colour at this point. It must have been the deepest shade of red. 
And then she whispered the thing that started my bad experience on that 
island that fateful day.

I thought is was going to be something romantic or sexy but she 
whispered, &quot;We could go exploring for spheres?&quot; Spheres?. Spheres?!? Is 
that what she wanted to tell me. I pushed her down, trying to make sure 
I didn&#39;t hurt her, and she started laughing.

&quot;Is THAT seriously what you want to do? I&#39;m serious, it&#39;s.&quot; but before I 
could finish my sentence she cut me off and completed it for me.

&quot;What is it &#39;hurt time&#39;?&quot; she said with a chuckle. Now my face was red 
with anger, but I knew I couldn&#39;t hurt the beautiful, innocent face in 
front of me.

&quot;You just lost like one-hundred respect points!&quot; I said trying to sound 
as angry as I could.

&quot;Why?&quot; She tilted her head and looked at me. I knew she knew why but I 
thought I&#39;d just play along.

&quot;You put on that whole sex and show and all you want to do is look for 
spheres! That&#39;s why Rikku, that&#39;s why.&quot; My monotone voice just came back 
before saying this so I was lucky.

She looked at me a blushed slightly. &quot;Are you just mad because I didn&#39;t 
suggest something more exciting or romantic?&quot; She got me, but I wasn&#39;t 
about to tell her that. Luckily for me, I was the smart one!

&quot;Hell no! I just don&#39;t like being led on, alright!&quot; I said. I think 
that&#39;ll do for now. I thought to myself. Oh, but how wrong was I?

She replied with, &quot;So you were expecting something more romantic!&quot; I 
blushed but turned away from her before she could notice.

I shook my head to add effect to what I was about to say. &quot;I swear, I 
don&#39;t know why I hang around with you Rikku. Every time I talk to you, 
you always somehow twist my words around and make me look like a 
complete ass!&quot; Then she did something that may have confirmed my 
feelings for her.

She hugged me from behind. &quot;Aw, come on Dr. P! Don&#39;t be like that!&quot; I 
decided to turn around and look at the young Al Bhed girl. Her eyes were 
shimmering a beautiful emerald colour. When I looked into them I 
couldn&#39;t help but smile softly. I then returned the hug. And she then 
started whispering in my ear while bringing me closer to her with the 
hug. &quot;We could always do something else.&quot; I couldn&#39;t believe what I was 
hearing! Was Rikku actually coming on to me! Whatever it was, I couldn&#39;t 
help but liking it!

I looked into her eyes again. She actually wasn&#39;t trying to make me look 
like a fool, but she actually had feeling for me, I could see it in her 
eyes. She moved her lips closer to mine and I did the same. Just before 
we met in that beautiful kiss, she must have tripped or something 
because she fell right on top of me.

&quot;Oh my God, oh my God! Paine, I am so sorry!&quot; She said as she got off of 
me.

I brushed off some dust that had gotten on me when we fell. I sighed and 
said, &quot;Rikku, oui lmisco vuum!&quot; with a chuckle in my voice.

She stuck her tongue out at me and said, &quot;You big meanie! That&#39;s not 
very nice.&quot; Just then, Lulu and Yuna walked in. I still that the gods 
that Rikku tripped before they came. We decided to leave shortly after.

-Present day on the Celsius-

So that&#39;s what happened and that&#39;s why I can&#39;t stop thinking about 
Rikku! I still smile every time I think about that day on Besaid Isle.

The elevator door opened and Rikku came running out and gave me a big 
hug. I pretended like I didn&#39;t enjoy it and tried to fight her off. 
&quot;Heya Dr. P! Whatcha up to up here all alone?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. I was just thinking about what we did on Besaid a week 
ago.&quot; I said in my usual monotone voice. She smiled at me.

&quot;Awww! You still think about that!&quot; She started blushing. Then she 
started whispering in my ear. &quot;It&#39;s kinda sad we couldn&#39;t finish what we 
started!&quot;

&quot;What are you saying?&quot; I really didn&#39;t know what she was saying. I 
finally understood when she softly brushed her lips against my cheeks. I 
blushes deeply and she continued talking.

&quot;Ever since that day, I couldn&#39;t get you out of my head. That day when 
we almost kissed I found out how I truly feel about you.&quot; she said with 
a blush. I pretended I didn&#39;t care but I was hanging on to every word as 
if my life depended on it. She continued, &quot;Paine. E muja oui!&quot; I looked 
up almost immediately!

&quot;What!?!&quot; I said right away. I couldn&#39;t believe she just said that, but 
she went on.

&quot;I love you Paine! I love you now and I always will!&quot; Rikku said with a 
deep blush.

She got closer to me and put her arms around my waist, but I didn&#39;t 
notice because her words kept re-playing in my head. I love you. I love 
you. I love you. I looked at her and she looked right back with the same 
seductive look like in Besaid. Our faces came closer together until we 
finally came together in that sweet, sweet kiss. It started out soft and 
gentle. But it eventually got deeper and more passionate. Rikku ran her 
tongue over my lip wanting to get in, and I was more than happy to let 
her. The sensation of her running her tongue over mine was amazing. I 
never felt anything like it! I didn&#39;t want it to stop.

But Rikku had to break away for air. Before we continued though, she 
just stared at me with those big, beautiful green eyes of hers. I knew 
why. She was waiting for me to say something. I looked at her and 
managed a soft smile. &quot;Rikku, for the longest time I didn&#39;t know how I 
felt about you. But now. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m just figuring this out now! 
I love you too Rikku! E muja oui!&quot; I said in a voice I&#39;ve never used 
before, a sort of soft and nurturing voice.

She looked at me with a warm smile and I couldn&#39;t help smile back. She 
kissed me again but this time it was more gentle and loving. When she 
was finished, she walked over to the elevator. She looked back at me and 
smiled. It wasn&#39;t like a warm friendly smile either. It was the smile 
from before our trip and the one on Besaid. This could only mean one 
thing.

&quot;I remember that smile.&quot; I said to the young Al Bhed girl. &quot;That smile 
always means that you want me to do something.&quot; She smiled deviously at 
me.

She replied with, &quot;Why don&#39;t you follow me and you&#39;ll find out, silly!&quot;

And so I did. And all I have to say is.

That was the best night I ever had!</pre>
