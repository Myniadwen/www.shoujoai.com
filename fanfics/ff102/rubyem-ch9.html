<p>&quot;I don't really know what to think. I mean, it's not like it's not  something that happened? I mean, 'Bhed, we're all about 'capturing the  moment' and living life as much as we can since you know, the whole  'kill on sight' thing Yevon had going for so long, but even then it was  slightly frowned upon, cause like, need babies to keep the people going  and all, and that's a little hard to do when one of the pair is missing  the right parts, and all.&quot; Rikku quietly babbled as she stayed curled  against Paine's side. They hadn't actually said much regarding  themselves, but the actions from earlier seemed to mostly say  everything for them, leaving them in comfortable, almost familiar  silence that just felt right. Rikku had finally broke the silence as  the tide went out, detailing her quiet worries about her feelings, most  of them regarding how others would view her. Paine found these worries  only slightly echoed in her, she was enough of an 'unknown' around  Spira that she didn't need to really care about being a role model, but  she understood why Rikku was worried.</p>
<p>&quot;How about thinking of it  as you being an example of why it's okay, now?&quot; Paine quietly  interjected as Rikku paused for breath, adjusting her hold around the  blond girls waist, fingers now bare of her gloves softly stroking over  the toned muscles of Rikku's stomach. She knew there were things that  still needed to be said, or she'd never forgive herself for it, but for  the moment, all was well. &quot;You're not ashamed of it, are you?'</p>
<p>Rikku  blinked lightly, dark green eyes flicking up to look at Paine's  features. She frowned faintly and wrinkled her nose, an expression  Paine found cute rather than upsetting. &quot;Of course I'm not ashamed of  it, I'm just...&quot; She trailed off, her expression softening a little. &quot;I  don't want to disappoint people. But I guess the important ones who  really matter won't be, huh?&quot;</p>
<p>Paine smiled lightly and shrugged.  &quot;You know your important people best, I think.&quot; She glanced toward the  path that headed to the village, knowing that most of those important  people were not very far away indeed. Rikku smiled lightly, Paine  leaning in and brushing her lips softly over hers, Rikku leaning to the  touch for a moment. &quot;I know why you worry, little thief, but I think  that you're allowed to do something for yourself now, huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  guess...forgive me if I worry for a little?&quot; The shorter girl asked,  shifting a bit and stretching her back, Paine arching an eyebrow  slightly as she pressed her fingers in a little firmer against Rikku's  stomach. &quot;We should probably be a little quiet, though...I mean, not  just because of being worried, more like. Yuna's so lonely, and I  just...I don't want to make thing's weird. It's already kinda stressful  with the weird thing about Bahamut and the tension with the Youth  League and New Yevon...it's all fun and everything being so active,  but...yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, it's okay, and I kind of prefer being  quiet.&quot; Paine smiled a little, this statement getting a giggle out of  Rikku. Resting her cheek lightly to the top of Rikku's head, a slightly  hesitant motion, Paine still slightly unsure. &quot;I'm kind of..&quot; She  sighed lightly, keeping her cheek where it was but turning her eyes out  to the water. &quot;This is new territory for me, Rikku. I don't...I don't  want you to get hurt. I've never...grh.&quot; A frustrated sound came from  her as she lifted her head, another sigh leaving her, Rikku watching  her, keeping quiet and letting Paine speak as she will. &quot;Not feeling  keeps me safe. Last time I let myself care...things didn't end well. We  do dangerous things...but I guess it's the feelings stirred by those  same dangerous things that won't let me just hide.&quot; Speaking more to  herself, Paine mused through the things which had tormented her for  quite some time. &quot;It's funny. You and Yuna took away my reason for  fighting when you destroyed Sin, only to give it back to me with your  very selves. Been a while since I've had that, and I'm not so good at  these sorts of emotional things...&quot; She trailed off, her cheeks flushed  softly after the string of words, more than she'd usually speak, the  woman finding that Rikku seemed to have that affect on her.</p>
<p>Rikku  shifted around, moving from Paine's side to in front of her, moving  into the warriors lap and straddling her waist, reaching up to rest her  hands gently on Paine's shoulders, fingertips studying the muscles  some. Searching the woman's expression, she smiled warmly, a different  sort of smile than what she usually wore. Paine found this certain  smile gave her a thrill inside, as there was just something...more,  about it. It gave Rikku a mature, gentler look, and the spark in the  younger woman's eyes carried a hint of the attraction she knew was  echoed in her own. It was as if curtains were pulled back from hiding  something, giving Paine a deeper look into the young woman in her arms.  &quot;It's okay. We'll figure it out I think.&quot; She reached up, stroking her  fingers through Paine's hair, tilting her head slightly and smiling at  the play of the firelight on the silver strands. Her smile quirked,  shifting in a breaths moment to the usual, somewhat mischievous smile,  making Paine quirk an eyebrow.</p>
<p>&quot;...what?&quot; She asked, idly  stroking her hands along Rikku's sides, drifting over her stomach to  around to her back, something Paine realized she had wanted to do for a  very long time.</p>
<p>Rikku giggled and tugged lightly on a strand of  hair. &quot;Just wondering if there's Ronso somewhere in your ancestry, and  if that's even possible!&quot;</p>
<p>Paine rolled her eyes and chuckled  softly, shaking her head a little. &quot;Like I haven't heard that one  before, meddma dreav.&quot; She lightly clicked her teeth at Rikku's hand as  the young woman trailed her fingers down along Paine's cheek, Rikku  squeaking lightly at the teeth clack, only to giggle and lean in,  nuzzling up under Paine's chin as she wrapped her arms up and around  her shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose, but it's still funny to me.&quot; Rikku  giggled, nestling in against Paine and closing her eyes, savoring the  feel of Paine's hands as they roamed along her back and abdomen.  Surprised at the fact that the warrior's hands weren't calloused from  wielding her sword, she supposed it was because of the leather gloves  which Paine usually wore, and quietly thanked her luck for Paine having  taken that precaution. A faint frown creased her features as she felt  Paine's hands still, Rikku flexing her back a little as she felt the  gentle press of fingertips a bit firmer to her skin, Rikku's arms  tightening around Paine's neck as she tensed a little in anticipation.</p>
<p>&quot;Rikku?  What's this?&quot; Paine quietly asked, her fingers softly exploring the  series of 'dents' she felt in Rikku's muscles, leaning back slightly as  she glanced down over the blond girl's shoulder, eyes searching the  smooth skinned back before she moved her hand around to Rikku's stomach  again, realizing that she had felt similar dents there earlier, but had  just dismissed it as an oddity of the position her hand had been in.</p>
<p>A  soft sigh drifted from Rikku, warmth breath washing over Paine's skin.  Leaning back slightly, she reached for Paine's wrist, gently directing  her hand to the two marks on her stomach which were obviously deeper  and larger. Smiling lightly, she looked up to the warrior, keeping one  of her arms wrapped up around Paine's shoulders. &quot;Teeth marks.&quot; Paine  blinked in a bit of surprise, opening her mouth slightly to say  something, but Rikku continued. &quot;Yeah, I know, I don't have scars on my  skin. Yuna panicked and used a really strong heal, and Lulu figured it  was also from me still being young and 'stretchy' as she put it.&quot;</p>
<p>Paine  nodded slightly, her brow furrowed a little as she softly probed the  dents. &quot;Chimera?&quot; She guessed, nodding when Rikku did and murmured  'lupus head'. Her frown grew a little more as she paused the motion of  her hand, looking to Rikku's face, a small pit growing in her stomach  as a thought quite suddenly crossed her mind, one that hadn't struck  her before. &quot;This killed you, didn't it? How many times on the  Pilgrimage...?&quot; The dangers of the Pilgrimage weren't unknown, so many  had failed so many times in the past, but since they had succeeded, it  never really triggered to Paine's thoughts that Yuna's was still just  as rough as any of the others.</p>
<p>Rikku fidgeted a little in Paine's  lap, her gaze turned out to the side as she didn't directly look at the  other woman. The idle exploration and discovery of the wounds had hit  directly onto something Rikku hated to talk about, death. Her dislike  of the Farplane was greater than the simple 'Bhed belief of what the  pyreflies did, it was largely because of her inadvertent visits there.  Paine tightened her grip on Rikku's hips when Rikku didn't respond to  her right away, the warrior about to repeat her question before Rikku  finally spoke. &quot;Yeah, it did. Which is probably the other reason why it  didn't scar, Lulu used a Phoenix Down as soon as they got me out of  it's mouth, about the same time Yuna apparently threw the big cure on  me that fixed things even before I had come back fully. I don't...I  don't remember it, or a bit of time before and after.&quot; She smiled  faintly. &quot;Apparently we were an unusual group of Guardians for a lot  more reasons other than how -many- of us there were...Lulu said that a  lot of other groups who wouldn't use Phoenix Downs like we did...we  were just...really intent on not letting anybody go.&quot;</p>
<p>Sitting up  a little straighter, Paine kept the fairly serious expression on her  features, but it was soft enough to obviously show her care in her  eyes. She found herself extremely upset over the thought that such a  thing happened to Rikku, and had to fight down the budding frustration  with Yuna and the other remaining former Guardians for having let it  happen, she knew logically that the same had probably happened to the  others, too. Her curiosity and worry prodded for her to speak again,  Paine unable to keep herself quiet. &quot;I'm glad, but...how many times?  Using Phoenix Down so much isn't...&quot; She trailed off, not needing to  say how the constant use of potions and other magical medicinal options  caused them to 'dull' in their effectiveness on a person, many people  in the military having been forced to retire when a usual potion  wouldn't do what it was meant to anymore.</p>
<p>Rikku glanced up to  Paine, able to tell that this wasn't an easy conversation for Paine to  hear, just as much as it wasn't easy for her to speak of it. Hesitating  for another moment, she mentally reminded herself that she had long  decided to be as honest as she could be with Paine, even if Paine  wasn't very forthcoming with details of her own past. She didn't have  to think long on her answer, leaning in to rest her cheek to Paine's  shoulder, looking at the pale woman's neck and watching her pulse.  &quot;Three times.&quot; She almost continued, saying what each time was, but she  didn't want to approach that subject just yet. Closing her eyes, Paine  sighed softly.</p>
<p>&quot;And once when you were a kid?&quot; Paine asked  softly, knowing of the source of Rikku's old, now gone fear of  lightning and how she got it. The thought of four times echoed  repeatedly in Paine's mind, her stomach feeling a little hollow. Rikku  shook her head slightly, Paine squeezing her eyes a little tighter shut.</p>
<p>&quot;Twice  when I was a kid. The lightning thing, and when I was in the same room  as a machina that exploded. We were only able to bring back four from  then, lots of people were too far gone by the time rescuers were able  to get there, it was past the hour point...&quot; Rikku trailed off,  shifting around in Paine's lap to sit with her back to the other  woman's chest, pulling Paine's arms around her, the warrior woman  eagerly holding the thief close. &quot;They thought that I might had been  gone for an hour and that the Down would be useless, but I guess  because of being Cid's kid they tried anyway and it wasn't too long.&quot;  She snorted in a faint, half laugh. &quot;Well, apparently, I'm here.&quot;</p>
<p>Leaning  down, Paine nuzzled lightly to Rikku's neck, inhaling her scent,  brushing her cheek against her soft blond hair. &quot;Oh Rikku. Five times  is too much...&quot; The thought of what this meant, fayth forbid, should  anything get so far out of hand that it would be needed, loomed in her  mind, worry that it would simply not work causing emotions to twist at  her heart again. Her mind flashed back to the Al-bhed girl rescuing her  from the fiend in the cave and how injured she was from it, a light  shiver flowing down her spine. &quot;I...want to ask you to stop doing this,  but that would be silly.&quot;</p>
<p>Rikku laughed softly, playing her hands  along Paine's arms around her. &quot;Yes, that would be silly. You should  know me by now, I think. Not going to let it stop me from living my  life...not remembering things around the time that things happened is a  little frustrating, though. I record a lot of things on spheres now.&quot;  She grinned as Paine made a bit of a surprised sound and lifted her  head a little, Rikku pointing to the pouch on her left hip, the most  'front' of the two. &quot;It's in there. I reuse the sphere if nothing  amazing happens that day, most days don't get saved. And no, I don't  have it going now...I won't forget this. It's mostly when I'm with  others, and during the day...I promise there's nothing 'bad' saved, and  I've got all of them very hidden.&quot; Looking over her shoulder to Paine,  she turned so that she could lean up and kiss the slightly wrinkled  nose of the warrior, Paine looking just slightly upset, but the  expression passed as understanding replaced it.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, just try  to keep things hidden, huh?&quot; Paine smiled when Rikku kissed her nose,  reaching up to lightly tap Rikku's chin before drifting her fingers  down along Rikku's jawline. Her smile drifted to something more  neutral, the woman's eyes growing a little distant. &quot;I guess it's only  fair to tell you I've needed it twice...&quot; A faint smirk touched her  smile. &quot;..that I remember anyway. There's a part of my childhood I  don't remember. Things just sort of stop, and then the rest of my life  starts. I don't think I needed it then? I think it was something else  that took my memory, but I couldn't tell you for certain.&quot;</p>
<p>The  blond nodded a little, a small swell of happiness inside that Paine  trusted her with this 'tidbit' of her past, Rikku squashing down  questions that sprung up. A pang of disappointment plucked at her  thoughts as she considered that Paine needed to have a Phoenix Down  used on her, but considering what she knew of Paine's lifestyle before  joining the Gullwings, she was pleased to know that it was only two and  no more. &quot;Thank you for telling me. It's all in the past, huh? We're  good enough to not need that anymore.&quot; She nodded with certainty,  trying very hard to not fidget in Paine's lap, very uncomfortable with  the current topic, but trying to keep calm. Paine looked down over  Rikku's shoulder, quietly inspecting the younger woman, smiling lightly  as she felt Rikku's discomfort. Her touch along Rikku's stomach  softened a bit, Paine nuzzling gently to the back of the thief's neck,  a soft shiver flowing down her back as she lightly brushed her lips  over soft skin. Rikku's shoulders slowly relaxed as she felt the topic  drift off, taking Paine's silence as confirmation of her musing. The  warm, soft feel of the older woman's lips against her skin helping to  soothe away the tension, Rikku's eyes slipping closed. Though her  gloves left her fingertips bared, Rikku idly removed them, tucking them  into a pouch as she dropped her hands down from lightly holding Paine's  arms around her to rest on top of Paine's thighs. Her lips quirked into  a smile as she felt the brief shiver from the woman behind her, Rikku's  deft fingers working over the top of the leather clad legs, drifting  down to play over the top of Paine's knees. Her touch was lazy, and  slow, she content with simply focusing on the feel of Paine's warm form  against her back.</p>
<p>Paine, for her part, found this to be new, and  enjoyable territory to explore, even if there was still that slightly  shaky unease of uncertainty in her thoughts. Having decided to actually  listen to the emotions in her thoughts and heart, she knew she wouldn't  just do things half assed, and though they were going to keep quiet,  that didn't mean she couldn't express her feelings, some what, and do  what she found she longed to do, and right now, that meant caressing  Rikku's sides and learning the feel of her skin below lips and fingers.  Rikku's hair was soft, and as cliched as it sounded, the warrior found  herself comparing it to the feel of soft feathers from Chocobos, a  smile quirking her cheeks as she nosed against the feathered earring  hanging along the side of Rikku's neck. She ran her fingers up over  Rikku's ribs, faintly disappointed to find that the 'Bhed wasn't  ticklish, fingertips briefly ghosting over the length of the tie for  Rikku's top that slipped around her sides, a bare pause spent with the  brief consideration of doing something further, Paine hesitating for a  moment before she slid her hands up to hold her shoulders, strong  fingers starting to massage as she placed a soft kiss behind Rikku's  ear. Disappointment thick in her voice, she murmured softly, not  wanting to speak too loud in the quiet of the night. &quot;It's getting  late, meddma dreav, we should head back...&quot; Rikku shivered softly at  the touch against the skin behind her ear, looking over her shoulder to  Paine, sticking her tongue out slightly as she leaned back into the  warrior's hands.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess. Just a little longer, please?&quot; Rikku  asked, squeezing lightly above Paine's knees, the other woman chuckling  softly as she nodded, Rikku smiling and shifting a little, resting her  head back against Paine's opposite shoulder. She closed her eyes and  let herself relax, really relax, for the first time since the incident  on the Celsius. Paine arched an eyebrow slightly as she felt Rikku grow  heavier against her, continuing to work her fingers softly into her  shoulders, easing the tension from the 'Bhed's muscles. A light sound  coaxed Paine to look to Rikku, the silver haired woman laughing lightly  to herself as she realized that Rikku had fallen asleep, the light  sound having been her starting to breathe a little open mouthed.  Exhaling a soft, happy sort of sigh, Paine shifted a little, pushing  sand over the last of the softly glowing coals with her heel before she  adjusted Rikku in her hold, smoothly standing and lifting Rikku in her  arms, carefully resting the 'Bhed girl's head to her shoulder. Paine's  cheeks colored in the darkness as Rikku gripped at her shawl in her  sleep, Paine exhaling slowly as she stood still and focused her  thoughts for a moment, composing her expression.</p>
<p>Starting back  toward the village, she switched her attention between watching the  forest and the path she was on to watching Rikku sleep, smiling lightly  as she considered how easy it was to walk with Rikku in her arms. She  had carried Rikku before, though that time had been fueled by panic  after finding her in the Thunder Plains when Rikku had decided to go  get rid of her fear and Paine had found her unconscious; she much  preferred this way. Usually, a person would look younger in their  sleep. Rikku's soothed, relaxed expression had something of the  opposite affect, leaving the young woman looking more mature, baring  more clearly to the world the strong person that lay below the bounce  and smile. Some days Paine could get a little frustrated with Rikku for  the cheer, not fully understanding why she was that way, but as time  went on she accepted it, even if she didn't quite understand it. She  guessed it was a survival mechanism like Paine's silence could be, to  keep the world a little at bay. Or, Paine thought as she recalled  Rikku's babbling before, she was doing it not for her sake, but for the  sake of everyone who knew her. Pausing for a moment, Paine frowned  slightly, this thought unsettling her some. But wasn't she just as  knowledgeable about doing things for someone else's sake? Her silence  regarding Nooj, Baralai and Gippal was a perfect example of that, but  there were other, lingering reasons in there as well, namely her want  to understand why some things happened. Did Rikku have other reasons?  Would Paine ever find them out?</p>
<p>She sighed, shaking her head a  little as she adjusted Rikku in her arms, cresting the hill overlooking  the village. Too many things to think about, she needed to focus, and  focus was something that eluded her lately. The village below seemed  quiet, the large bonfire burnt down to a small flame, lighting up only  a small circle, just a few figures left up, three to be exact. Paine  chuckled lightly as she easily identified Yuna, Lulu and Wakka, the  rest of the village having left for their individual huts, she finding  herself glad that the Gullwing boys had decided to stay there instead  of head back to the airship. She felt slightly the outsider as she  descended the hill, after all, there were three people who saved the  world, and what did she have? Tilting her head a little, the light  haired warrior glanced down at Rikku, a smile curling her lips. She had  the heart of a woman who helped save the world, and depending on how  things continued with whatever it was Baralai and Nooj were hiding,  maybe she'd belong after all.</p>
<p>Yuna looked up and blinked in  surprise as she heard Paine approach, her eyes widening a little when  she saw Rikku held in the other woman's arms, Yuna starting to stand  before Paine shook her head and gestured slightly with one hand,  speaking softly. &quot;It's okay, she's just asleep.&quot; Yuna fairly quickly  relaxed back down to sit, tilting her head a little and looking over  the sleeping woman in Paine's arms.</p>
<p>Lulu, who looked a little  surprised that Yuna had noticed Paine before she or Wakka did, nodded a  little and smiled lightly, about to say something before she paused,  her brow furrowing just slightly as she looked Paine over some, almost  as if she were seeing something she hadn't before, and was retaking  stock of the warrior, Paine noticing this but not saying anything,  simply stiffening her shoulders slightly as she neared the fire. Yuna  blushed soft and offered Paine a crooked smile, rubbing behind her neck  a little. &quot;We didn't know you were gone. Thought that you and Rikku had  gone to bed.&quot; She murmured, keeping her voice low. &quot;Where were you?&quot;</p>
<p><em>Crap.</em> Paine briefly thought. She hadn't considered what she should say if  someone asked that question, taking a moment to slightly shift Rikku as  an excuse for not speaking immediately. &quot;I needed something from the  Celsius, and hung out on it for a bit. Rikku was on the beach when I  left the ship, and she talked for a while, then fell asleep.&quot; She hoped  she sounded convincing, and she was partly truthful, Rikku did talk a  fair bit before falling asleep. She noticed the subtle lift of Lulu's  eyebrow, knowing that the older woman had probably picked up on the  little white lie, but Wakka seemed oblivious, the man half asleep as he  held the black mage.</p>
<p>Yuna giggled softly and nodded. &quot;Yeah, she  does that sometimes, huh? Thank you for not leaving her on the beach.&quot;  Paine sighed with relief internally, Yuna at least had bought it, and  she knew that right now that was most important to Rikku. Looking over  to the hut that she and Rikku had been given, she nodded to Yuna and  smiled lightly, moving about the edge of the firelight to head to the  hut.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't have left her there Yuna. I've carried you down  from falling asleep on the deck, not going to leave her in the cold  sand when she's still not quite one hundred percent.&quot; Paine quietly  chastised the former summoner, hiding a smile when she spotted Yuna's  blush, Lulu and Wakka laughing softly. &quot;See you in the morning.&quot; She  quietly spoke, excusing herself from further conversation with the  small group as she slipped into the hut. Pausing in the doorway, she  stood still for a few moments, letting her eyes readjust to the dim  lighting. Outside she heard the muffled murmuring of the others, it  trailing off into mostly silence as she listened to the group move to  Lulu and Wakka's home, letting the nighttime sounds of the jungle creep  in. Over the soft crackle of the last bits of the fire mingled the  sounds of bugs and frogs in the night, the occasional interruption of a  bird. Closing her eyes, Paine focused on the sounds around her,  furrowing her brow slightly as she pinpointed a strange bit of silence.  Turning her head slightly, she opened her eyes again, looking at the  wall of the hut that was closest to the temple, frowning faintly as she  considered the quiet.</p>
<p>&quot;You gonna stand here all night or are we  going to lay down?&quot; Rikku's soft voice startled Paine from her  thoughts, Paine starting a little and glancing down to Rikku, an  eyebrow raising slightly, Rikku giggling lightly, she looking still  mostly asleep as she gently held to Paine's shawl.</p>
<p>&quot;Hush. You're  lucky I didn't leave you on the beach.&quot; Paine quietly teased, smiling  as she arched an eyebrow slightly, moving over to Rikku's bed,  crouching slightly as she moved to set Rikku down. Tilting her head  slightly as Rikku didn't seem inclined to let go of her shawl, she  gently rested one hand on either side of Rikku's shoulders, looking  down to the woman below her. Rikku quietly looked up to the warrior,  her hands curled in their hold on Paine, cheeks flushing softly with  color.</p>
<p>&quot;Stay with me?&quot; She quietly asked, a little bit of a  tremble to her voice as she let go of Paine with one hand so she could  tug her scarf off before tugging her bandanna off and letting her hair  a little more loose, squirming slightly to get her boots off, two soft  thuds heard on the floor as they fell. Paine's cheeks colored faintly,  Rikku's smile growing a little at being able to get such a visible  reaction from the woman. She was nervous asking Paine to do this, a  little voice in the back of her head scolding her for leaping so  quickly to such a thing, but right now, there wasn't much more that she  wanted in the world than to have Paine lay with her for the night. She  held her breath somewhat as she waited for an answer, her eyes quietly  searching Paine's.</p>
<p>This wasn't quite what she expected today,  Paine's thoughts falling into a confused jumble as she looked down to  Rikku, eyes long adjusted to the dim lighting and able to easily see  the woman below her. She watched as Rikku pulled her scarf away, eyes  having followed it's motion and watched it pool on the floor. Looking  back to the thief, she stayed stock still in her position half  crouched, thoughts in her mind crying for dominance. A few more base,  almost bestial thoughts crept into her head, shooed away by the slowly  growing strength of reason, reminders to take care with what she was  doing whispered in her head. Her old habits built up to protect herself  grumbled in the background, calling her a fool for ignoring them and  doing what her heart pleaded. Her heart spoke loudest, having gained  confidence and strength the more she listened, and the butterflies  fluttered in her chest again. A quirk of a smile touched her lips as  she shook her head slightly. &quot;How could I say no?&quot; She murmured, her  heart giving a little victorious cry as she was rewarded for her answer  with a wide, happy smile from Rikku. Pulling back just slightly, she  undid her shawl and let it drop over the scarf on the floor, her long  boots soon making their own thudding sound on the floor as she knelt on  the bed and leaned over Rikku slightly, both women pausing as the  thought of exactly how they were going to lay hit both of their minds  at once. Rikku moved a little toward the edge of the bed, Paine  somewhat automatically moving over the 'Bhed to lay behind her,  reaching out and wrapping one arm around Rikku, gently pulling her back  closer to her, the blond's back resting against her chest. Rikku rested  her hand over Paine's, threading her fingers with hers, holding Paine's  hand to her breastbone as she took a slow, deep breath, closing her  eyes and exhaling in a soft, happy sounding sigh.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you...&quot;  Rikku murmured, smiling as she felt Paine nosing lightly to the back of  her neck again, the warrior moving herself about a little until Rikku  spooned nicely against her form, Rikku thanking the fact she was  shorter than Paine. She got a mumbled 'mmhmm' in response, Rikku  giggling softly but letting it be at that. Paine seemed to busy herself  with softly nosing to Rikku, lightly nudging the blond hair aside so  she could better brush her lips against skin, it really nothing more  than an idle, caring touch, she softly resting her forehead against the  back of Rikku's head after a little, stilling her motions and laying  quietly.</p>
<p>Silence once again fell on the two women as it did on  the beach, but where words weren't needed there, one phrase was  constantly repeating itself in Paine's mind. She pushed it back,  wanting to leave it for the moment, this only seemed to make it pipe up  louder, Paine finally sighing softly. &quot;Rikku...?&quot; She quietly asked,  the blond having laid still through Paine's shifting around, her  breathing slow and even, making Paine wonder if she was even awake.</p>
<p>It  took a moment, but Rikku turned her head slightly, opening one eye.  &quot;Hmm?&quot; She sounded a little like she was half asleep, but her open eye  showed enough awareness. Paine tightened her hold on her a little,  faintly biting the inside of her cheek for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;I know it  probably goes without saying, but, I have to say it, or I'll never be  able to live with myself if I don't and something happens...&quot; Paine  spoke, recalling the strange silence around the island's temple and  quietly dreading the next days events, thoughts of the strange machina  seen in the spheres lingering in her mind as well. Rikku frowned  slightly at Paine's words, picking up a little on the worry in the  other woman's tone, turning a little more to look to Paine's face,  worry in her eyes as she tensed a bit. Paine mentally cursed herself  for having to babble out her reason for speaking, she certainly didn't  want to have worried Rikku. Offering her a smile that was genuine  despite the mental scolding she gave herself, she cleared her throat  lightly, her cheeks coloring in the dim light of the room. &quot;...I love  you, Rikku.&quot;</p>
<p>Relaxing as Paine continued and brushed away the  worries that had abruptly bubbled up inside of her, Rikku felt the  upwelling of emotion at finally hearing those three simple words, the  rest of the world abruptly meaning virtually nothing as Rikku tightened  her grip on Paine's hand to nearly crushing. A soft tremble ran down  her back as she looked into Paine's eyes, the sound of what Paine had  just said echoing in her mind. It seemed as if Paine were playing the  thief for once, stealing words from Rikku, but after a long moment of  looking into Paine's eyes, she smiled brightly, unable to prevent the  happy laugh that escaped. &quot;Oh Paine...E muja oui..&quot; The words just  wouldn't come out in anything but Al-bhed, but Paine understood, and  when Rikku replied, she couldn't help but smile as she tightened her  hold and leaned in to nuzzle her cheek lightly to Rikku's. Rikku made a  soft, cheerful, almost animal like sound, Paine laughing very softly,  her laughter a low and deep sound that was in complete opposite to  Rikku's.</p>
<p>&quot;Boy, that feels a little anti-climatic, doesn't it?&quot;  She quietly mumbled, the giddiness of relief at finally saying it  making the warrior woman smile despite her best efforts, it seeming to  have a similar effect on Rikku, Paine shaking her head a little and  softly pressing her face to the cascade of blond in front of her.</p>
<p>Giggling,  Rikku shrugged a little, letting her head fall back to the pillow as  she looked across the room, her cheeks flaring with a blush. &quot;We'll get  to a climax later.&quot; She teased, squeaking when Paine lightly pinched  her collarbone and mumbled a soft 'naughty' against her neck, Rikku  just giggling again as she let her eyes drift closed. &quot;It's...better  than anything else I've ever heard in my entire life, Paine. It doesn't  need a fanfare, my heart's jumping around enough as is...E muja oui, E  muja oui, E muja oui...&quot; She repeated a few times, her voice trailing  off to silence as she held Paine's arm tightly around her, Paine intent  on holding Rikku tightly to her.</p>
<p>&quot;I love you too Rikku...&quot; Paine  replied, letting her words trail off with nothing more said, keeping  the words that finally were spoken as the last things said to help  usher them into sleep. Both women let out quiet, relaxed and happy  sighs as they nestled together, the island night warm enough to negate  the need for a sheet or blanket, any worries of the current times far  from their thoughts, their world consisting of each other, and very  little else. Paine smiled against Rikku's shoulder as she felt the  blond drift off to sleep again, closing her eyes and shifting just  slightly, she too soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>Author's Noteage: It  ocured to me that it might not be so clear as to where in the 'game'  we're at. I don't jive with the thought that everything takes place in  a week or a few days, when I think of these worlds, things take -time-.  In my timeline and head for how things go when I write in here and in  'Life In Luca' with the OC's, for example, Yuna's pilgrimage took  nearly a year and a half to complete, to me, when I sort things out to  make it fit better in a story sense. The character's age at the end of  that is what they list in the guide books or what have you. Yuna being  17 at the end of her pilgrimage, 19 now. Rikku 15 back then, 17 now.  (Yuna's the old lady, Paine's 18) Obviously, age isn't as much of a  factor in some things in Spira as it might be here. Where Rikku rambles  on about how Al-bhed are more or less accepting of same sex  relationships, she categorizes it in how they knew that at any moment  they could easily die thanks to Sin. Sin's presence in Spira made  people grow up a lot faster than one would usually, on top of saving  the world and all, so I really don't want to hear it about how they're  'just teenagers', because no, they're not aside of their actual age.</p>
<p>'Ruby  and Emerald' starts at the end of chapter 2 after fighting Baralai and  Dark Bahamut inside of Bevelle, and I went back and changed the first  paragraph of chapter 1 to better reflect this, so if you've archived it  or have it saved, you may wish to go and recollect chapter 1. We're  lingering at the beginning of chapter 3 if you chose to go to Besaid as  the 'hotspot'. I obviously didn't have fiends pour out of the temples  all over the place after Dark Bahamut, I need some drama and build up  thank you. ;) Things will continue to follow the main story line,  though, no worries.</p>
<p>And I -really- want to babble about potions  and how I think they and white magic work but that would make this  -way- too long. I'll get to explaining it in the next chapter of 'Life  In Luca' if you really want to know, go look there. Uh, when I put it  up. Hee.</p>
<p>Al-bhed translation:<br />
  'meddma dreav' 'little thief'<br />
  'E muja oui' 'I love you'</p>
