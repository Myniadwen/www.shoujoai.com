<h1>Never Again Will I Slip (part 8 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff102/index.html">Final Fantasy 10-2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jessvolk.html">Jessicka Volkinivia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff102/nevagain-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Paine walked into her room quickly and grabbed a hi-potion, then walked 
back to the bathroom and reached into the tub, hoisting Rin up by his 
collar and slung him over her shoulder, then exited again, kicking Rikku 
in the head firmly, getting a satisfying groan from her &quot;victim&quot; once 
again.

Paine shook her head and drug Rin back to her room where she, all but 
forced him to drink the hi-potion. Though the blood stopped flowing and 
the cuts healed, she still needed to drain the blood from his eyes and 
fix his broken nose.

She sighed and got to work, grabbing a single bladed utility knife and 
cut a slit across both of his eyes that were swollen shut as he jerked 
up quickly from the bed, trying to get off of it.

She shook her head and punched him square between the eyes, knocking him 
out cold.

&quot;I can get this done quicker now...&quot; She said, as she reached over and 
clinched her hand around his nose.

&quot;Good thing he&#39;s knocked out..&quot; Paine gripped his nose firmly them 
jerked it to one side, then the other, breaking it and rebreaking it and 
placing it back to the correct position.

She wiped the blood up from around his nose and everywhere else as best 
she could with a red washcloth.

Paine stood up and deposited the bloody washcloth into the trashbin, 
then stretched and sat down on the floor.

Brother had finally gotten to his feet, his nose still dripping blood 
and looked over to Buddy, who was just beginning to awaken and opened 
the bathroom door to check on Rikku, who was laying there on the tiled 
floor, a bloody mess.

&quot;Help! Help! Help! Dammit!&quot; He screeched out and began running in 
circles until Paine slowly walked out of Rin&#39;s room and spotted Rikku, 
then looked to Rikku and looked at Brother. &quot;What now?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean, what now? Rikku is dying!&quot; He scooted down on the 
floor and cradled her head in his arms. &quot;Come on Rikku...you can make 
it!&quot; He shivered and began crying in that high-pitched voice we all 
know.

&quot;She will live.&quot; Paine mumbled and went back into her room and slammed 
the door, beginning to pack her bags. There was no way she could stay 
here..especially with &quot;her&quot; here.

Paine walked back over to Rin&#39;s room and smacked him hard on his left 
cheek, jolting him awake.

&quot;YR! FRYD DRA VILGEHK VILG?&quot; He screamed out. (AH! What the fucking 
fuck?&quot;)

&quot;I need to talk to you, Now! Rin.&quot; She said before sitting down on the 
bed.

&quot;I think I better listen to you before I get the hell beat out of me 
like Rikku did..

&quot;That&#39;s exactly what I need to talk to you about, Rin...I can&#39;t stay 
here...with her here...it just causes problems.

Rin was about to object, but seeing the look in her eyes he thought it 
be better to keep his mouth shut and let her continue.

&quot;Here..&quot; Paine reached into her pocket and pulled out a note. &quot;There&#39;s a 
clue to where I&#39;ll be...give that to her for me..&quot;

Rin took the note and opened it, reading aloud &quot;It&#39;s a place that is not 
to far from where Operation Mi&#39;hen was conducted, the climate is 
moderate and alot of Al Bheds hang out there...there&#39;s also a cafe where 
the Ronso hang out at.&quot; He nodded then folded the paper and put it in 
his pocket.

&quot;Thank you Rin...for allowing me to stay here...as long as you did..&quot; 
She grabbed her rucksack and headed out of Rin&#39;s room, before his hand 
grasped her wrist.

&quot;Paine..Oui yna ymfyoc famlusat rana...so tyikrdan...E tuh&#39;d lyna ruf 
aynmo un ruf myda ed ec...oui femm ymfyoc...ymfyoc...ryja y bmyla du 
nacd ouin rayt...ug?&quot; (You are always welcomed here...my daughter...I 
don&#39;t care how early or how late it is...you will always...always...have 
a place to rest your head...ok?)

Turning around she smiled slightly and hugged him tightly, but not tight 
enough to knock the wind out of him.

&quot;Dryhg oui vydran...dryhg oui cu silr...&quot; (Thank you father...thank you 
so much...)

He nodded slightly and waved as she walked out the front door of the 
Travel Agency.

Though you couldn&#39;t see it just from the direction you were looking at 
him but, his eyes did began to water slightly, as he turned and walked 
to the bathroom and pulled a potion out of his pocket, to administer it 
to Rikku...</pre>
