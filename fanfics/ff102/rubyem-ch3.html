<span name="storytext" id="storytext"> Yuna watched as Paine paced around the  engine room, the silver haired warrior glaring at the engines when  they started to whine lightly from the strain Buddy's piloting of the  injured ship was putting on them. Yuna twisted the half skirt of her  gunner outfit in her hands, chewing on her lower lip as the various  possibilities as to what could have happened to Rikku kept flashing  through her mind. To say that Paine was agitated was to woefully  understate her current state of mind, Paine was going mad with  concern, and guilt at not being able to catch a hold of Rikku when  the ship started to lurch. She was calling on everything she learned  as a warrior to keep her focus on the plans for finding the fallen  thief.
<p>&quot;Yuna, stop that.&quot; Paine's  voice was harsh as she startled the ex-summoner from her thoughts,  Yuna blinking at the other woman who had come to a stop in front of  her.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>Paine scowled a bit, a small part of  Yuna's mind thinking that this was the most emotion she had ever seen  from the woman. &quot;Stop twisting your skirt like that. It's  maddening.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And your pacing around isn't?&quot;  Yuna snapped back, then eeped lightly as Paine gave her a look that  would likely kill most weaker fiends.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to get the raft ready.  The ship's descending.&quot; Paine stalked over to one of the storage  chests, pulling out a rugged inflatable raft used for getting to  shore when the Celsius can't land on a  small island. The intercom  near the door crackled with static, coming to life as the slight  jarring motion of the airship landing on the water was felt.</p>
<p>&quot;Paine, Yuna, Buddy here. I  managed to get her landed, and I think we're close to where things  happened, but Im not entirely sure. I don't think that we'll be able  to get the Celsius in the air again until I get the controls fixed,  though. But we can steer her along the water if needed, okay?&quot;  The navigator's voice was tense.</p>
<p>Yuna ran up the steps to the intercom,  pushing a button and replying. &quot;We understand. Paine's getting  the raft ready..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yuna, come on.&quot; Paine  interrupted, pulling the readied raft towards the door that opened to  the outside.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got our communicators  Buddy, we'll be in constant contact.&quot; Yuna clicked the intercom  off and jumped over the railing to down by Paine, helping the warrior  push the raft down the ramp as the door opened, showing the darkening  sky. &quot;Oh no, the sun set...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's what the lanterns are  for.&quot; Paine gestured to the two lamps set at the ends of the  raft. &quot;Get in, I'll push it into the water.&quot; Yuna nodded  and quickly obeyed Paine's order, shifting into her white mage  dressphere as she did so, the end of her staff lighting up to add a  bit more light. Paine pushed the raft into the water, jumping in as  the door closed behind her, and started up the small engine, steering  away from the Celsius in order to orient themselves in the open  water.</p>
<p>&quot;Rikku!&quot; Yuna called out,  shining the lantern around over the surface of the water. &quot;Rikku!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yuna, quiet a moment. If she were  near, she'd have seen and heard the Celsius. Listen for her.&quot;  Paine clenched her jaw a little, squinting towards the horizon to try  to spy a landmark against the last light of the setting sun. Her  warriors eye spied a darker shape that didn't move like the waves,  and started the raft heading in that direction, the engine a light  hum.</p>
<p>Yuna started murmuring softly to  herself, Paine recognizing the hymn of the fayth that she heard Yuna  often hum to herself in stressful situations. It personally drove her  nuts, and she knew even Rikku was irritated with it, but Paine knew  Rikku wouldn't say anything about it to her cousin. It occasionally  bothered Paine that the Al-bhed was so quick to put aside her own  happiness for Yuna's, and she never could quite figure it out, and  was mildly irritated that it was because of Yuna that they were in  this whole mess with Vegnagun. True, they hadn't actually gotten  involved in anything yet, Nooj had only given them a vague idea of  what was going on, and hinted they likely should stay out of it, the  Youth League was going to handle it. Paine had a bit of a sinking  suspicion that they'd end up dealing with it -anyway-, she guessed  that there was just something about Yuna that wouldn't let the  ex-summoner turn away from helping Spira. Then there was the whole  thing with the Leblanc syndicate and having to find a way to sneak in  to the headquarters to get their broken sphere back, but all of that  was far from Paine's mind. Right now, all she cared about was finding  Rikku.</p>
<p>They had traveled away from the Celsius  for about two hours now, the ship lost behind the horizon. Buddy  would check in periodically, and had let them know that Brother was  awake and okay, and that he and Shinra had made some progress in  repairing the damage to the ship, mentioning once that it really  seemed that someone had sabotaged the ship while they were in Kilika,  but it was too early to really say, and there were much more pressing  matters to deal with. The further they got from the airship, the more  frequently Yuna called out for Rikku, swinging the lantern from the  front of the ship back and forth across the water.</p>
<p>&quot;What's that?&quot; Yuna pointed  out towards the right with her staff, leaning  out over the edge of  the raft a bit, swinging the light towards it.</p>
<p>Paine furrowed her brow and steered  towards where Yuna was pointing, a small shiver flowing through her  as she realized what it was, Yuna gasping audibly. One of Rikku's  sleeves floated on the water, Paine reaching out to grab a hold of  it, noticing that two of the bows were ripped free. &quot;One of  Rikku's sleeves.&quot; Paine stated simply, handing the bit of fabric  to Yuna, continuing to steer the boat.</p>
<p>Yuna held the bit of fabric close to  her chest, and Paine couldn't help but feel that Yuna had almost  already decided that Rikku was gone.  Paine scowled at the dark sky  and the silence that answered each of Yuna's calls, the girl starting  to get a little hoarse. A half hour passed from where they had found  the sleeve when there was a light bump against the boat, Paine  swinging the lantern from the back off to the side, stalling the  motion of the boat.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Yuna questioned,  moving to lean and look where Paine was.</p>
<p>&quot;Not sure, felt a bump against the  boat.&quot; Paine looked back towards where they had come from, Yuna  leaning and continuing to look where they had stopped. Squinting as  she held the light out over the water, she spied something glinting  in the water. Reaching back, she grasped Yuna's staff and tugged on  it lightly. &quot;Yuna, let me use that, please.&quot;</p>
<p>Yuna let Paine take her staff, but  continued to look out opposite from where the warrior was. Paine  stretched the staff out towards the shape, guiding it closer. &quot;Her  dagger.&quot; She clenched her teeth as she realized what it was and  pulled it closer, dropping the staff into the bottom of the boat and  picking up the red knife.</p>
<p>&quot;But why is it so far from where  her sleeve was?&quot; Yuna clutched her staff to her as Paine slipped  the dagger into her belt.</p>
<p>&quot;It's heavier than the sleeve, and  likely took longer to float to the surface, so a current probably  drew it here.&quot; Paine mentally smiled at how smart it was for  Rikku to have made the dagger handle buoyant. This info made Yuna  start calling out again as Paine started the ship moving again,  thinking to herself. 'Rikku, you better be out there, or I'll go to  the farplane and bitch you out like you never heard...' Her thoughts  became occupied with the feelings she had towards the young Al-bhed,  it nearing the year mark since they had known each other.</p>
<p>She had found the bubbly girl  irritating at first, that she couldn't deny. When Rikku had asked her  to join the Gullwings, she quickly found herself wondering what she  had gotten into, the four Al-bhed more than she had ever dealt with.  Buddy and Shinra she quickly learned to deal with, it was Rikku and  the hyperactive and seemingly mentally disturbed Brother who were a  lot harder for her to get used to. She did however, quickly learn to  respect Rikku and her abilities as the two went out in the field  after spheres, her abilities making it easier for Paine to find ways  to get along with the thief, and soon enough, the two had formed a  curious friendship. Paine had also found herself caring for Rikku in  ways that she didn't really want to acknowledge. Being in the raft  and looking for Rikku scared her more than she really wanted to  admit, and she knew that she would never quite forget the feeling,  nor the sight, from when Rikku fell from the deck and she was unable  to catch her.  She felt a growing determination to find a way to  voice her feelings to Rikku, ignoring for the moment the fact that  she first had to find the words to describe what it was she felt in  the first place.</p>
<p>As Yuna called out yet again, Paine was  drawn from her thoughts by noticing a light in the distance that  seemed a lot brighter than the glittering stars. Moving the light  behind her, she gestured to Yuna. &quot;Yuna, here, steer the boat  for a bit.&quot; She moved forward to the front of the boat past the  quizzical look she was getting, and dimmed the light at the front.</p>
<p>&quot;Paine?&quot; Yuna moved to steer  as asked, keeping the boat going in a straight line.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a light up ahead!&quot;  Paine felt a surge of hope as she realized what she was seeing wasn't  a star, but rather what she figured was a fire on the thing she had  determined long ago to be an island, the whole reason they were  heading in that direction.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe it's Rikku!&quot; Yuna's  voice lifted with the same hope as Paine felt, and Paine nodded,  letting a faint smile escape. The engine thrummed louder as Yuna  increased the speed, both she and Paine subconsciously leaning  forward as if urging the boat to go faster.</p>
<p>Paine held the lantern just above her  shoulder and back a little, letting it illuminate the area but keep  her vision clear so she wasn't partly blinded by the light. She  crouched at the edge of the raft, faintly biting her lower lip as she  stared at the little fire as they got closer. She felt her breath  catch in her throat as she was able to make out a figure lying in the  sand next to it. &quot;Rikku!&quot; She called out, half hoping that  it would be just some random person who decided to live on the small  island who would be mad at her for waking them, but no such luck,  they didn't respond, and as they neared, she was able to see Rikku's  teletale blond hair. As the raft first bumped against the sand, she  jumped from it into the shallows, hearing the engine of the raft  complain as Yuna gunned it to run it ashore.</p>
<p>&quot;Rikku?&quot; She called again,  softer as she neared and dropped down to her knees next to the still  girl, Yuna running up behind her a moment later with one of the  lanterns.</p>
<p>&quot;Rikku! Oh Spira...Paine...is  she?..&quot; Yuna trailed off and bit her lip as Paine gave her a  look that would kill most weaker fiends, falling silent and holding  the lantern up while clutching her staff to her shoulder.</p>
<p>Paine stroked her fingers over Rikku's  forehead, frowning at the feel of her fever, her eyes trailing down  over the girl's body. She noticed the condition of her arm at the  same time Yuna did, judging by the gasp she heard behind her, and  faintly touched the bruised area. &quot;We'll have to set the bone  before you can heal it Yuna...her wrist too.&quot; She cupped Rikku's  cheek and stroked her thumb back and forth softly. Again her breath  caught as she felt the girl stir, and when she saw the bright emerald  glitter of Rikku's eyes, she realized it was one of the most  beautiful and relieving sights she's ever seen.</p>
<p>&quot;Uhn...Paine? Yunie?&quot; Rikku's  voice was soft and shaky, and she looked as if she didn't believe  what she was seeing.</p>
<p>Paine blinked a few times to force back  the tears she felt threatening in her eyes, nodding and giving Rikku  a rare smile, rewarded with a faint one from the girl. &quot;Yeah,  it's us. Thought you could fly, huh?&quot;</p>
<p>Rikku rolled her eyes slightly and  tried to sit up, Paine shifting around to gently gather Rikku up into  her arms, grimacing slightly as the thief whimpered faintly as her  arm was moved. &quot;I didn't flap my arms well enough I guess.&quot;</p>
<p>Yuna was openly crying at this point as  she knelt down in the sand, taking her cousins good hand into hers  and squeezing tightly. &quot;We were so worried! I'm so glad we found  you, I don't...I...&quot; She bowed her head, Rikku squeezing Yuna's  hand and rubbing her thumb back and forth against Yuna's.</p>
<p>&quot;Shh, it's okay Yunie, you found  me, huh?&quot; She heavily dropped her head to Paine's shoulder,  closing her eyes for a moment before she looked out towards the  water. &quot;Where's the Celsius? I want off of this island.&quot;</p>
<p>Paine shook her head a little. &quot;We'll  have to wait until morning. Buddy was able to land it about two hours  away from here by raft, I don't want to get us lost on the raft, and  they're still working on it.&quot; She went on to fill in Rikku about  what happened, what they suspected had happened, and what was going  on, Yuna filling in what happened before Paine had gotten to the  ships bridge. They also let Buddy know that Rikku had been found, and  coordinated with him to find the island in the morning.</p>
<p>Rikku frowned through the entire  explanation, shaking her head. &quot;Great, just what we needed, more  problems.&quot; She scowled, shifting a bit in Paine's arms, her eyes  looking a little glazed as she shivered softly.</p>
<p>Paine shifted slightly herself to get  comfortable as Yuna transformed back into her gunner dressphere,  since it had been determined that a little more care would be needed  before Rikku's injuries could properly be healed. &quot;Here, this  should help you feel a little better.&quot; Paine smiled faintly as  she pulled Rikku's dagger from her belt, a little thrill going  through her as Rikku's eyes widened and she smiled happily.</p>
<p>&quot;My dagger! I knew it was a good  idea to have it buoyant. Thank you for finding it.&quot; She kissed  Paine's cheek, not seeming to notice as the warrior blushed softly,  Paine brushing the sign of thanks as a byproduct of Rikku being so  worn physically instead of anything deeper, murmuring a soft 'you're  welcome'. Yuna came back to the fire with an armful of firewood,  feeding the flames back into a brighter glow, looking around as she  sat next to Paine and Rikku.</p>
<p>&quot;This island isn't big, I was able  to walk around it. I bet there are other small islands near here.'  Yuna remarked.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe. Not often you find a  solitary island.&quot; Paine shrugged lightly.</p>
<p>&quot;I  don't care if there are any other islands near, I'm just glad I was  able to find this one!&quot; Rikku smiled a little to her cousin,  then let her eyes close, keeping her head rested to Paine's shoulder.  Paine tilted her head slightly, faintly brushing her fingers of her  free hand over Rikku's swollen and bruised arm, scowling lightly. She  jumped lightly when Rikku spoke in soft Al-bhed, knowing  that Paine  understood it. &quot;Ed'c kuehk du rind y mud frah dra puha kadc cad,  ech'd ed?&quot; (<em>It's  going to hurt a lot when the bone gets set, isn't it?</em>)</p>
<p>Paine nodded lightly, answering in  Spiran as she was resistant to actually speaking Al-bhed, but kept  her voice too low for Yuna to hear, though judging by the spaced out  look on the girl's face as she stared up at the stars, Yuna wasn't  listening anyway. &quot;Yeah, I'm sorry, but it will.&quot;</p>
<p>Rikku  sighed. &quot;Knayd.&quot; (<em>Great.</em>)  She turned her head and looked at the bruising, smiling faintly. &quot;Yd  maycd ed megamo lyh'd rind yhosuna dryh ed ymnayto tuac. yht ed'c  sunpetmo bnaddo, eh y 'knayd Ixion dryd'c yh ikmo pnieca' cund uv  fyo.&quot; (<em>At least  it likely can't hurt anymore than it already does. and it's morbidly  pretty, in a 'great Ixion that's an ugly bruise' sort of way.</em>)</p>
<p>That drew a smile from Paine, the  warrior having had such morbidly amusing thoughts in the past in the  field, knowing it was a way of coping with the stress and pain. &quot;It  clashes with  your eyes.&quot; She felt her cheeks flushing as soon  as she said that, but was so happy to hear the giggle that got.</p>
<p>&quot;Eh, the yellow kinda matches.&quot;  Rikku smiled softly, then grimaced as she shifted a little, closing  her eyes.</p>
<p>Paine faintly bit her lower lip,  glancing over to see that Yuna had laid down and seemed asleep, then  she looked back to Rikku, her voice soft as she spoke. &quot;I'm  sorry, Rikku.&quot;</p>
<p>That caused Rikku to open her eyes  again, looking confused up at Paine. &quot;Sorry? For what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For letting you fall.&quot; Paine  glanced away, then blinked as Rikku laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;Paine, you made one hell of a  gouge in the deck with your sword, and did everything you could have  to try to get me before you got knocked to the door. You have nothing  to apologize to me for, honestly.&quot; She reached up with her good  hand, and gently cupped Paine's cheek, feeling the heat of the  woman's blush, knowing hers were hot as well. &quot;It's okay.&quot;</p>
<p>Paine reached up and gently pulled  Rikku's hand down, a few voices in her head telling her that she  really needed to remember that Rikku was both in pain, and had a  fever, and she shouldn't do anything rash or approach serious  subjects while the Al-bhed likely wasn't completely in her right  mind. No matter how much she wanted to bend down and kiss the girl  right there and now that she had her in her arms, and was no longer  afraid for her life. Seeing the slight look of hurt in Rikku's eyes  when she pulled her hand down, Paine inhaled a deep breath and gently  kissed the back of her hand. &quot;If you say so. But, you need to  rest, okay? I'll stay up for the watch.&quot;</p>
<p>Rikku closed her eyes and exhaled  softly. &quot;I'll not argue with that. I feel like I could sleep  forever.&quot;</p>
<p>Paine scowled slightly. &quot;Forever?  Not willing to let you do that yet. But I'll give you a few hours.&quot;</p>
<p>Rikku smiled lightly, her breathing  already evening out as she started to drift off. &quot;Just need a  few hours...thank you...&quot; Her voice trailed off as Paine felt  her fall completely asleep.</p>
<p>As the silence settled on the little  hunk of sand with a few trees, Paine looked around, finally taking  the time to study the island she credited with saving Rikku's life.  She smiled lightly, considering how it would be a decent place to set  up a small hut, though, that also depended on if there were other  islands nearby. She liked her solitary places, which was why she  holed up in the engine room so often. A gentle wind blew across the  sand, the flames flickering about as the fire crackled.  Paine let  her eyes trail down to look over Rikku's form again, taking advantage  of the stillness to let herself refresh her memory of how the girl  looked.</p>
<p>&quot;You care for her, don't you  Paine?&quot; Yuna's soft voice startled Paine from her revere.</p>
<p>Paine frowned lightly. &quot;Of course,  she's a teammate, like you. You're my friends.&quot;</p>
<p>Yuna smiled sleepily from where she  lay. &quot;That's all?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; That little voice kept  trying to say that was true, which the honest one she knew was right  kept going 'pft, liar.'</p>
<p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you trying to lose respect  points like Rikku now?&quot;</p>
<p>Yuna giggled softly. &quot;Wake me in a  few hours and I'll watch till morning.&quot; She grinned as Paine  grunted noncommittally, rolling over to her side and letting her back  be to the fire.</p>
<p>Paine  sighed softly and shook her head. She had that sinking feeling that  she was getting into something deeper than she really fully realized.  It scared her a little, but as she looked at Rikku in her arms, she  knew she was quite willing to try anyway, all she needed now was that  bit of courage to take the first step.</p>
