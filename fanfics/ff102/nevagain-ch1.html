<h1>Never Again Will I Slip (part 1 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff102/index.html">Final Fantasy 10-2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jessvolk.html">Jessicka Volkinivia</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Note: Set a few years after FFX-2. Paine lives by herself, 
Rikku lives on the airship and Yuna and Tidus have settled 
down. Want to know more? You gotta read it. This will be 
only my second story submitted to so if you think it sucks, 
give me some pointers to help me out, please?

Setting: Macalania Woods.

Paine slept soundlessly, tossing and turning in her sleep, 
clad only in a sports bra and a black thong.

Day would break soon and she would awake at the same time as 
she did everyday, just as the sun peeped up over the clouds, 
as if wondering to rise or sleep in.

After a few minutes of musing the sun finally rose and with 
it Paine rose as well.

She sat up slowly and looked around at the small log cabin 
she had built for herself on the outskirts of the Macalania 
Woods.

Why she chose this place was unknown to anyone, even 
somewhat to herself.

It possibly had something to do with the fact of the matter 
that she wanted to live alone.

Alone with her thoughts and her dreams.

The feeling of waking up with someone else there holding you 
was a feeling that, before you know it, it was gone..and the 
&quot;someone else&quot; was gone with it.

She rubbed her eyes slowly before pushing herself off of her 
makeshift bed, make of logs and tree bark.

She was used to the cold so it didn&#39;t bother her.

Her nipples did indeed harden in the cold but that was 
normal.

What wasn&#39;t as you would say &quot;normal&quot; was the fact that 
everytime she stole a glance at Rikku, her nipples hardened 
as well and her knees got weak, her throat dry and her 
&quot;center&quot; became moist.

She had often daydreamed about her and Rikku on dates.

They would be holding hands and smiling at each 
other...then..as they were about to kiss, she would always 
shake her head and break herself out of the daydream.

It was a daydream that she felt impossible so she chose to 
try to avoid daydreaming about it.

She had once made a slip and told Rikku about her feelings 
for her.

That was the reason Rikku lived on the airship and Paine 
lived alone.

Rikku blew up at her and even slugged her, hard enough to 
make her topple over like a sack of bricks.

The look in Rikku&#39;s eyes had spoke volumes upon volumes.

Hatred, disgust, more hatred and disgust, oh yeah, did I 
mention hatred and disgust? I didn&#39;t? Well, hatred and 
disgust.

Rikku had then, pretended to be herself in front of Yuna, 
but after Yuna left, it was a different story.

She avoided Paine like the plague and played mean tricks on 
her, like, tying her sword on the tip of the Celsius, 
pouring slow drying super glue into Paine&#39;s shampoo and body 
wash, as well as her feminine wash.

That one had been the worse and the most painful. No pun 
intended.

Awhile back, before the group had separated, Rikku had sent 
Paine on a wild goose chase, claiming that Yuna was in grave 
danger, mentioning that Shuyin and Seymour had both been 
brought back from the Farplane and had both viciously 
attacked Yuna when they had wandered into the Macalania 
Woods.

Paine had rushed to where Rikku had supposedly last seen 
Yuna, her sword drawn as she looked about, seeing hide nor 
hair of Yuna, as she was about to respond she felt a searing 
pain in her back and turned to see Rikku with her daggers 
drawn deep inside of her back.

Paine gritted her teeth and fell forward unto the ground, 
blacking out immediately.

When she awoke she saw herself cover from head to toe in her 
own blood and had gathered enough energy to cast a cure 
spell on herself.

Though it was not enough to mend her wounds completely, it 
would stop the blood flow.

Paine had limped to a clearing of the woods and promptly 
passed out again, due to sheer exhaustion.

As she awoke, she felt almost back to normal and was able to 
cast a full-cure spell on herself.

In the days and weeks that followed, she worked hard at 
creating a place for herself in the woods.

It wasn&#39;t the best but...it would do until she decided to 
return to civilization and find a decent place to stay.

She stretched her arms over her head and cracked her neck 
and sat back down on her bed.

Even with what Rikku had done to her, she still loved her.

Though as hard as she tried to hide it, she still knew that 
deep in her heart, there was always a place with Rikku&#39;s 
name on it.

She sighed and closed her eyes. &quot;Rikku...E muja oui...&quot;</pre>
