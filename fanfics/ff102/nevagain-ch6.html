<h1>Never Again Will I Slip (part 6 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff102/index.html">Final Fantasy 10-2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jessvolk.html">Jessicka Volkinivia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff102/nevagain-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Buddy, Brother, Shinra and Rin were still catching up on old times, when 
Rikku awoke at half pass noon. She quickly jumped out of bed, and rushed 
to where they sat in the main lobby, whispering softly in Al Bhed. Rikku 
ran over and placed her hands on the table, solidly, startling everyone 
at the table as they jumped back at the same time, their chairs 
screeching loudly on the floor, as they looked at her wide-eyed.

&quot;Ryc cra paah drnuikr rana oad? Ryc cra paah drnuikr rana oad? Ryc cra 
paah drnuikr ran oad? Ryc cra..!&quot; (&quot;Has she been through here yet?&quot; 
(repeat) Rikku yelled franctically, right before Brother placed his hand 
over her mouth to silenced her, earning himself a nice, healthy piece of 
skin, being bitten clean from his flesh as he jumped out of the seat and 
waved his bloody hand around, screaming at the top of his lungs, some 
expletives in Al Bhed, throwing blood everywhere around.

Rin jumped up quickly and grabbed Rikku by the shoulders, shaking her 
violently. &quot;Rikku! LYMS DRA VILG TUFH! FRYD&#39;C KUDDAH EHDU OUI?&quot; (&quot;Rikku! 
Calm the fuck down! What&#39;s gotten into you?&quot;) Rikku tried to break free 
from his hold, only to have him tighten his grip on her. &quot;Rikku...you&#39;re 
not going anywhere until you tell me what&#39;s gotten into you&quot; Brother 
still hopped up and down, waving his bloody hand about, screaming bloody 
murder at Rikku. Rin turned around and glared at Brother &quot;Pnudran! Crid 
ib! Oui lyh gemm ran, yvdan E kad cusa ehvunsydeuh uid uv ran!&quot; 
(Brother, shut up! You can kill her, after I get some information out of 
her!&quot;) He turned back to Rikku and stared into her eyes, and as he 
spoke, he had a commanding and firm, yet gentle voice. &quot;Rikku...what is 
going on? You can tell me..&quot;

Rikku sighed and through up her hands, in an aggravated way &quot;I&#39;m in love 
with Paine! OK? OK? Will you all just leave me alone now and let me cry 
and be angry for once? Just because I&#39;m always happy-go-lucky and 
cheerful, doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s the real me! You wanna know why I do it? 
Do you? Huh? Well, I&#39;ll tell you all why I do it! I do it because 
without me..!&quot; She chuckled slightly and gave them all a sneer and a 
look of disgust. &quot;...without me...you all are nothing!&quot; Her voice rose 
in volume. &quot;Without me, there&#39;d be no one to pick ya&#39;lls sorry asses up 
when ya feel down! Without me, Yuna would have killed herself when that 
little blonde, bitchy bastard dissappeared! Without me...you all would 
have commited suicide by now! I&#39;m the one that keeps everyone&#39;s heads 
up, keep their spirits high when the going gets rough! Without me, all 
of ya, you included Rin! Would all be look mopey, sorry ass people! I 
keep a smile on everyone&#39;s faces...not you!&quot; With that she spat on the 
floor and walks out of the Travel Angency.

Everyone stood there, frozen like a statue, until Shinra&#39;s voice broke 
through the silence. &quot;Well...she&#39;s officially snapped..it was only a 
matter of time...&quot;

Rin shook his head slowly and stepped back, sitting down in his chair, 
looking deep in thought. Even Brother had stopped yelping about his 
injured hand and looked to be in thought. Shinra, as always, was hidden 
behind his mask, so you couldn&#39;t tell if he was sleeping, thinking or 
laughing inside his mask as he sat in his chair across from Rin. Buddy, 
took off his googles and let them dangle from his neck as he crossed his 
arms and leaned against a wall, head down in a gesture of thought.

Buddy voice suddenly broke everyone from there thought processes. &quot;You 
know...she might have a point...she seems to think everyone takes her 
for granted...we&#39;ve been so used to seeing her happy and cheerful that 
this is how we react when she&#39;s not exactly how we want her to be. Or 
how we normally imagine her...

Brother spoke up after that &quot;Cra fyc clyno muugehk...hajan pavuna ryja E 
caah ran mega drec...

&quot;(She was scary looking...never before have I seen her like this..)

&quot;Apparently. She has gotten feed up with everyone treating her like a 
cheer leader, or morale(moral, not sure of the correct spelling) 
booster. We should learn to take care of our own problems. Without her 
help...&quot; Rin said.

Everyone looked at Shinra, awaiting his genius reply. When he did not 
speak, Rin leaned over the table quietly and placed an ear to Shinra&#39;s 
mask. &quot;Ra&#39;c cmaabehk...&quot; (He&#39;s sleeping) Rin whispered after a few 
moments of quiet. He slowly got up from his table and carefully picked 
Shinra up from his chair and lifted him up, with Shinra&#39;s arms around 
his neck as he slept. Rin looked over to the others and whispered. &quot;E&#39;s 
kuehk du bid res du pat, fa ymm cruimt kad cusa nacd yc famm...&quot; (I&#39;m 
putting him to bed...we should all get some rest as well...) Everyone 
nodded as Rin exited towards Shinra&#39;s room. As he got there, he slowly 
pushed the door open with his foot and laid Shinra on the bed. He leaned 
down and spoke softly to Shinra. &quot;Shinra, sit up so I can remove your 
mask...&quot; Shinra sat up and yawned cutely, rubbing his eyes. &quot;Mmm...Dad? 
Did I fall asleep again?&quot; Rin nodded and smiled, ruffled Shinra&#39;s hair 
gently. &quot;It&#39;s ok my son...it&#39;s alright...you need your sleep. I&#39;ll be 
here when you wake up, just come to my room. Shinra closed his eyes, 
then reopened them as his eyelids got heavier and heavier. &quot;Promise, 
Dad?&quot; Rin nodded and smiled, moving towards the lampswitch. &quot;Promise, 
Shinra..now get some sleep..&quot; He leaned over and kissed Shinra&#39;s 
forehead softly before heading towards the door. He had made it out of 
the door and was about to close it behind him when Shinra&#39;s voice spoke 
again, softly. &quot;Dad?&quot; &quot;Yes, my son?&quot; Rin replied softly. &quot;I love you, 
Dad.&quot; &quot;I love you too, my son...&quot; With that, Rin closed the door and 
made his way towards his room.

Rikku went up to the deck of the airship and sat down on the floor, 
pulling her knees close up to her.

&quot;Why does everyone think that, the only emotions I&#39;m allowed to show are 
happiness and cheerfulness?&quot;

She stood up and dusted herself off. She had a plan. &quot;I&#39;ll leave before 
anyone wakes up...see how far they can get on there own without 
cheerleader Rikku there to give them a swift kick in the ass to get them 
going...&quot; She nodded with a smile on her face and laid down on the deck 
of the airship, quickly falling a sleep...</pre>
