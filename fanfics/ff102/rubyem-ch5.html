“Great fayth!” Yuna  muffled her second scream, crouching down and clenching her eyes  closed, keeping her hand over her mouth.
<p>“Dammit Yuna, what  the hell?” Paine twisted to look to where Yuna had been pointing as  Rikku tried to sit up a bit better and see herself. The already pale  woman went a lighter shade as she spied what it was that caused Yuna  to react in such a fashion. “…oh…”</p>
<p>Rikku felt a twinge of  worry at seeing Paine’s reaction, managing to prop herself up with  her good arm and look over the warrior’s shoulder. Her eyes widened  and she lightly bit her lip, a shudder flowing through her.</p>
<p>The stand of trees  wasn’t very large, much easier to see in the daylight than it was  in the dim firelight. The trees were knotted and gnarly, bent from  growing under the buffeting of the ocean winds and storms. A few  sparse grasses grew about the base of the trunks, a thick,  odd-looking vine winding around as well. None of this was so unusual,  but what was higher up off the ground was. Strung up with the vines  and pieces of wire were the corpses of several beings, set up in a  rather macabre scene, as if reenacting a battle.  Four bodies,  dressed in Al-bhed style clothing were set up so they were facing off  against a Ronso, Guado, and two Yevonites, all with weapons drawn and  in a stage of attack. A few pyre flies floated among the corpses as  they swayed slightly in the wind.</p>
<p>“That’s…not  normal.” Rikku broke the silence, her eyes locked on the Al-bhed,  disturbed by what the scene represented almost more than the bodies  themselves. She noted that despite the likely humid location of the  island, the corpses looked like the bodies occasionally found in the  desert during digs, dried and stiff.</p>
<p>Yuna turned around and  faced the water, and began to talk to the communicator, trying to get  Buddy or Shinra online, her eyes still clenched closed. Paine blinked  a few times and shook her head. “I’ve never seen anything like  that.”</p>
<p>“It’s like it’s  some sort of…snapshot? Of the things that happened in the past. A  disturbing memorial to something, but why way out here where there’s  nothing? Paine, help me stand.” Rikku bit her lower lip as she  pushed herself up further.</p>
<p>“Why?” Paine didn’t  try to keep Rikku down, standing as she lifted the thief to her feet.  Her eyes looked over Rikku, a little dismayed to see that the suns  light didn’t do much to help improve the way the girls’ injuries  looked.</p>
<p>“I want to see it  closer…” Rikku took a few steps towards the center of the island.</p>
<p>“Don’t go near it!”  Yuna spun about and ran in front of Rikku, holding her arms out as  she faced her cousin, tears in her eyes. Rikku blinked and stepped  back once, bumping lightly into Paine, who automatically rested her  hands at Rikku’s side to steady her.</p>
<p>“Yunie? I know it’s  not exactly the nicest thing to see, but I want to see who did it and  if there’s a sign of why someone did it…”</p>
<p>“No! I know who did  it, and when we leave we have to set fire to this island.” Yuna was  visibly shaking at this point.</p>
<p>Paine narrowed her eyes  slightly. “Yuna, we should at least bury them, or you should do a  sending, you’re still a summoner even if the aeons are gone,  setting the island on fire is a little extreme…”</p>
<p>Yuna shook her head,  taking Rikku’s good hand in hers and looking to her with pleading  eyes, back and forth between her and Paine. “No, there’s nothing  that I can do, a sending wouldn’t work, and it might make things  worse. Please, let’s just get in the raft and get away from here a  little?”</p>
<p>Rikku frowned, looking  irritated and exhausted. “Yuna, I’m not moving until you at least  tell me why this is making you so upset!” Her expression softened  as a choked sob came from the dark haired girl, and she squeezed  Yuna’s hand. “Yunie, please?” She leaned back against Paine  slightly.</p>
<p>“I…it’s…it’s  not something that’s done anymore, and it hadn’t been done for  years. Part of my training as a summoner was to look for these, and  destroy them. They were something that even the church was against,  even though it had been the idea of a counsel so long ago.” She let  go of Rikku’s hand and sank down to her knees, shivering and  wrapping her arms around herself. Rikku leaned heavily against Paine,  murmuring to the warrior, who helped the thief sit, settling behind  her herself.</p>
<p>“What are they?”  Paine asked, looking up to the center of the island again. Death  wasn’t a stranger to her, but this particular thing was. Rikku  stayed silent, but reached out and took Yuna’s hand in hers.</p>
<p>“Curses. The people  who made them knew that the Al-bhed traveled, and believed that these  would haunt them, or keep them from settling somewhere.” She  squeezed Rikku’s hand, not looking up from her lap, and Rikku  scowled a little, glancing up at the trees again.</p>
<p>“So they murdered  innocent people and strung them up in trees?” Rikku narrowed her  eyes. The cruelties of the old church of Yevon were far from unknown  by her, but this was a new one for even her.</p>
<p>Yuna nodded lightly.  “The Al-bhed were killed on sight back when this was in place. The  others in the scene were usually volunteers, actually. The Ronso  eventually stopped being involved in this, and when one of the more  pacifistic leaders who preached forgiveness as a method to change  them instead of being so violent came into power, these were outlawed  and commanded that they be destroyed. All summoners were taught to  destroy these with fire when found.” She reached up and ran her  fingers through her hair. “Trying to perform a sending would be  bad. I was told it would awaken some type of ancient fiend that had a  habit of settling below these. If you went near it Rikku, you might  have woken it up.”</p>
<p>Paine made a light  sound of disbelief. “How old is it then?”</p>
<p>Yuna shrugged.  “Hundreds of years.”</p>
<p>“But, I never heard  of anything like this! We aren’t exactly shy about talking about  the horrors that Yevon did to us, and something like this would  definitely have been mentioned. There’s no way that all of them  would have been destroyed before someone found them…” Rikku was  completely confused.</p>
<p>“I imagine most were  destroyed rather quickly, the church could work fast when they wanted  to. How long was this…’program’ in place, Yuna?” Paine ran a  hand through her hair, faintly rubbing at her tired eyes.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, they  didn’t exactly get that much into the history. It was mentioned  during my training only as an aside, since it was believed that all  of them were destroyed. They obviously missed one.” Yuna scowled,  her pretty features twisted with the expression. “It was one of the  things I hated the most, the blind stupidity. I didn’t…I mean,  for fayth sake, I’m half Al-bhed! I just…grah.” She stood up  and paced towards the waters edge, jabbing at the communicator again.  “Dammit Buddy, wake up.”</p>
<p>Rikku looked towards  Yuna’s back for a few quiet moments, then sighed and looked back  towards the trees. “Ironic in a way, then, that this island should  save my life. Maybe they’re making up for it, in some small way.”</p>
<p>Paine smiled lightly.  “Maybe. Shall we do as Yuna asked?” She tilted her head towards  the raft, an eyebrow arched slightly.</p>
<p>“Eh, why not. And the  burning will be like a funeral pyre, which is what we do anyway.”  The blond grunted lightly as she shifted to her knees and stood,  leaning slightly away from Paine’s touch. “I can stand, it’s  okay, now that I’m more awake.”</p>
<p>Paine kept her hand at  Rikku’s elbow anyway. “Just because you can doesn’t mean that  you should.”</p>
<p>“I’m only picking  up your stubbornness.”</p>
<p>“You certainly don’t  need any more of that, meddma dreav.” (Little thief)</p>
<p>Rikku blushed lightly  as she walked over to Yuna, tilting her head slightly as she caught  the tail end of the conversation the gunner was having with the  Celsius. “Well, if you can’t pinpoint it, don’t worry, there’ll  be a lot of smoke.”</p>
<p>Buddy’s voice sounded  tinny through the little earpiece. “Hey, great idea Yuna, a signal  fire will definitely be visible. Just be careful, okay? Don’t need  anyone else hurt in all of this.”</p>
<p>“Sig…oh, yeah,  right. Yeah, we’ll be careful. Likely sit in the raft or something  just incase.”  Yuna looked a little guilty as she spoke, and Rikku  had to smile a little. “Yuna out.” The communicator clicked off  with an electronic beep.</p>
<p>“Any idea how long  it’ll take them to get here?” Rikku faintly bit her lower lip as  she adjusted the makeshift sling of her scarf.</p>
<p>“Buddy said about an  hour. The controls are fixed, but the strain he put on the engine  yesterday broke a few things, and Brother’s working on it. He’ll  use the auxiliary engines to guide it here.” Yuna turned around  with a soft sigh, looking back at the center of the island. “Anything  specific you want to do in regards to the pyre?” She looked  sideways to Rikku and Paine, Paine looking a little confused for a  moment until she remembered the mention of the Al-bhed funeral  practices earlier.</p>
<p>“Heh, didn’t think  you remembered that.”</p>
<p>“I was there,  remember.”</p>
<p>“Not totally. Pops  wouldn’t let me out of his reach for a month, and I was younger  than you.”</p>
<p>Yuna disappeared for a  moment in a brief flash of light, reappearing in her Black Mage  dressphere. “Well, regardless, I remember. I just don’t know if  there were any specifics?”</p>
<p>Rikku shook her head  before bowing towards the center of the island, her lips moving as  she murmured something to soft to be heard. She turned around and  walked to the raft past the still confused Paine, who was attempting  to piece together what the short conversation meant without asking  directly. “Nothing else. Go ahead Yunie.”</p>
<p>Paine briefly looked as  if she were going to give in and ask, but decided that the  seriousness of the issue should be left as is, and that she was too  tired to ask anyway. She helped Rikku into the raft and pushed it  into the water, standing with the water up to her knees, holding the  raft still while she turned and watched Yuna. “Careful not to wake  anything up, hey Yuna? I’m not in the mood to fight anything.”</p>
<p>Yuna smiled faintly.  “That’s a first. Mark that down, Rikku.”</p>
<p>Rikku giggled lightly,  looking out towards the ocean. “Noted.”</p>
<p>Rolling her eyes, Paine  crossed her arms and watched with a calm look hiding her curiosity as  she watched Yuna prepare to cast Fira. Twirling her staff about, Yuna  took careful aim at four points about the sides of the trees, easily  launching the spell, hitting on target. Flames almost immediately  started to grow as Yuna watched for a moment. Selecting four more  points, she cast Fira once more, the double shot of magic quickly  overtaking the trees and grasses. Thick black smoke began to rise  into the sky as Yuna bowed, then turned and walked to join Rikku in  the raft, changing back to gunner halfway.</p>
<p>Paine stood for a  moment after Yuna climbed into the raft and settled herself behind  Rikku, letting her cousin lean against her. The warrior’s eyes  traced the flames as they steadily consumed the trees and bodies  within, tilting her head back and watching the smoke drift up into  the calm morning sky. “Cleansing.” Rikku made a sound of  agreement and Paine settled herself in the raft, taking control of  the engine and directing the raft a short distance away from the  island before turning the engine off to save power. Silence settled  on the three girls, Rikku drifting off to sleep again in Yuna’s  arms as Paine leaned against the side of the inflatable raft, still  watching the island.</p>
<p>“How are you going to  set her arm?” Yuna’s question was so soft spoken that Paine  almost didn’t realize it was said for a moment.</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I figure  you’ve more experience doing it, and I’d rather not have Barkeep  doing it, even if he knows medicine.”</p>
<p>Paine arched an eyebrow  as she lightly crossed her arms. “And what makes you assume I have  experience with it?”</p>
<p>Yuna gestured a little  with her free hand. “You’re a warrior…this is kinda your thing,  isn’t it? On the pilgrimage, Auron and Lulu did everything that I  couldn’t. Auron because he had to on his previous pilgrimage and it  was in his training, and Lulu because well, she just sort of fell  into it.”</p>
<p>Paine smiled faintly.  “That motherly thing she has going on.” She had met the Black  Mage a few times when Rikku made them stop in Besaid while sphere  hunting before Yuna joined, wanting to check in on her cousin.</p>
<p>Yuna smiled. “Yeah,  that motherly thing. With the Celsius in such beat up state, I don’t  want to wait and try to get to Besaid, and this really needs to be  taken care of…” Her dual colored eyes shone with worry as she  looked down at Rikku.</p>
<p>Rubbing her forehead,  Paine sighed lightly, leaning her head back and staring upwards at  the sky. “Yeah, I know. I just. I don’t want to be the one to  cause her more pain.” Her voice was soft as she spoke, words almost  lost in the wind.</p>
<p>“How about you cast  Sleep on her before? You’re a little higher in the Black Magic  skills than I am, I’ve not learned that much.”</p>
<p>Paine blinked lightly.  “That would work perfectly. It should last long enough that I get  the bone set, and her wrist, and then you use Cura. That should heal  it almost fully.”</p>
<p>Yuna nodded. “She’ll  still have to be careful for a few days, but yes, that should do it.  What did you guys do before I came?”</p>
<p>“Barkeep. Like you  said, he has some training, and well, it was all we had now and then.  If something were really serious we’d fly to Luca or Bikanel, which  ever was closer. Since Shinra only figured out the dressphere  abilities of the spheres we found just before you came, we didn’t  have the ability to change into a White Mage. Rikku had limited  magic, things she learned with you I suppose, but it wasn’t good  enough for serious injuries. Barkeep, potions, and a fast airship.”  Paine stretched her legs out, glancing over to the island again for a  moment.</p>
<p>“Oh.” Yuna made a  faint sound that roughly translated to ‘Glad I don’t have to deal  with that’, and fell silent again. She and Paine both looked  towards the island when an echoing crash sounded from it, one of the  larger trees falling, taking down anything that was left standing.  Yuna sighed again and closed her eyes, turning away. “I wish we  hadn’t found that. I’m glad that we were able to take care of it,  but, still…”</p>
<p>Paine didn’t answer,  simply continued to watch the flames as they started to die down. She  sat more upright after a little bit and started the boat engine  again, moving it back a little closer to the island, the current  having taken them away a distance. Turning the engine off again, she  tilted her head, turning and squinting at the horizon. “Here comes  the Celsius.”</p>
<p>The red airship glided  up to the raft a few minutes later, Buddy and Brother at the cargo  doors to help pull the raft in. It apparently took an amazing amount  of self-restraint for Brother to keep from hugging Rikku to him; the  two talking in such rapid fire Al-bhed that Paine could barely keep  up. Yuna made an offhanded remark about how no matter how much they  argued, Rikku and Brother still cared for each other, and as Brother  actually picked Rikku up despite her protests, and carried her to the  cabin, Paine had to agree, even if she did feel a little irritated  that it wasn’t her carrying the thief upstairs.</p>
<p>As they followed, Buddy  filled Yuna and Paine in on the repairs and their suspicions. Shinra  had gotten in contact with Kilika and found that some New Yevon  troops had come down from the temple a few times into the city, and  Dona immediately suspected that it was one of them who had sabotaged  the ship in revenge for the Gullwings giving the sphere to the Youth  League and essentially joining their ‘side’. He and Brother  weren’t completely convinced that it was sabotage, surprisingly;  they had had a few similar issues with the airship when it was first  salvaged, but Shinra was positive that something had been fiddled  with. Instead of arguing with the kid, Buddy and Brother settled for  simply getting the airship as repaired as they could, working through  the night and not taking any breaks so that they could get to the  island and get the three girls.</p>
<p>The rode to the cabin  in silence after Buddy got off at the bridge, Paine changing into her  Black Mage dressphere as they did, Yuna into White Mage. Stepping  out, they heard Rikku and Brother still talking at a fast pace, a  thrown pillow soon chasing Brother down from the upper level of the  cabin. “Yuna! You fix Rikku, yes?” The lanky man walked up to  Paine and Yuna, Barkeep and Oaka sitting at the bar and looking up  towards the girl’s sleeping area as Paine walked past Brother and  towards the stairs.</p>
<p>Yuna nodded, holding  her staff up a little. “We will Brother, don’t worry.” She gave  the pilot a smile, the unusually subdued Brother nodding and simply  leaving the cabin.</p>
<p>“Mish Paine, Mish  Yooona, do you need help, yesh?” Barkeep gestured about a little  with his large hands.</p>
<p>Paine shook her head.  “No, we got this.” She didn’t look to the others as she slipped  quietly up the stairs, pulling her hat off to lower her profile,  peering up over the edge towards the beds. Rikku was lying on her  bed, eyes clenched closed as she grimaced in pain, her hand holding  tightly to the sheets. Paine could only figure that Brother had  jostled something painfully, and had to smother the bit of anger that  drew up. Lifting her staff, she gestured lightly in the air and spoke  the words needed, Rikku blinking her eyes open for a moment before  the Sleep spell overcame her and quickly sent her into a relaxed  state of unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Following Paine up the  stairs, Yuna nodded lightly as she saw Rikku fall asleep again as  Paine shifted back to her usual warrior self, quickly walking over to  the bed. She faintly bit her lower lip as she untied Rikku’s scarf  from about her neck and arm, feeling where the bones were moved to  now that she didn’t have to worry about causing too much pain, even  though Rikku occasionally grimaced.</p>
<p>“Tyssed.” (Dammit)  Paine swore lightly, gently shifting Rikku about so she could get  into a good position.</p>
<p>“That bad?” Yuna  stood at the foot of the bed, holding her staff tightly.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Paine closed  her eyes for a few moments, taking a few deep breaths. “You might  want to turn around, Yuna.”</p>
<p>Yuna bit her lower lip  for a moment and nodded, turning around. She quickly decided she was  glad she did as she was able to hear the audible grinding of bone,  grimacing as even through the spell Rikku still cried out lightly,  and Paine cursed again, a darker series of words. “Is it okay?”</p>
<p>“Just a moment.”  Paine felt like her heart was being ripped out as she pulled at Rikku's  arm again, causing Rikku to whimper in pain. “E’s cunno, meddma  dreav.” (I’m sorry, little thief) She murmured lightly. Even  though she knew this was needed, she still hated the fact that she  was the one making it hurt. Rikku’s wrist was easier and brought no  reaction from the girl, and Paine let out the breath she was holding.  “Okay, quickly, huh?” Paine stood from the bed and started to  pace a bit along the foot of the beds, flexing her hands into fists  and releasing them again, her jaw clenched.</p>
<p>Nodding, Yuna turned  and moved to take Paine’s place, reaching to brush a bit of hair  from Rikku’s forehead, leaning down and murmuring something to  quiet for Paine to hear before she started to cast the needed spell.  “I’ve got you. This’ll help.”</p>
<p>Paine clenched the  railing as she heard Rikku groan softly while the healing white light sank into  her, the warrior taking a few controlled breaths. Yuna apparently put  a fair bit of energy into the spell, the girl staggering back and  sitting heavily on her bed when she finished. Paine turned, raising  an eyebrow slightly as she glanced at Yuna before moving over to  Rikku’s side. “You okay, Yuna?”</p>
<p>“Yeah…just…put a  lot into that. I think…I’m going to take a bath.” Yuna’s  voice was thick with exhaustion as she dropped her staff heavily onto  the bed. She stood and swayed for a moment, then shuffled to the end  of the loft and into the bathroom, an audible click as she locked the  door, a sure sign of having every intent of using the bathroom for a  long time.</p>
<p>Paine smiled lightly  before she sat lightly on the bed next to Rikku, letting out a soft  sigh of relief as she looked over the now much better looking thief.  She closed her eyes, taking up Rikku’s good hand and leaning down  over her, lightly resting her forehead to Rikku’s shoulder. “Don’t  ever scare me like that again. I need to figure out how to say how I  feel…” She lifted her head and glanced towards the bathroom door,  and figuring that Yuna was going to be in there for a few hours at  least, Paine took a deep breath before she lightly shifted Rikku to  the side a little, and lay down next to her, taking the Al-bhed into  her arms.</p>
<p>Rikku shifted a little  in the spell-induced sleep, curling closer to Paine, sending a small  thrill through the warrior. Paine tried to keep her eyes open,  wanting to stay alert in case any came up the stairs, or Yuna left  the bathroom, but try as she might, soon enough, she joined Rikku in  dreamland, the two sleeping in each others arms.</p>
