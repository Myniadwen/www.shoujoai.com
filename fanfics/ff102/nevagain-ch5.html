<h1>Never Again Will I Slip (part 5 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff102/index.html">Final Fantasy 10-2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jessvolk.html">Jessicka Volkinivia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff102/nevagain-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Rikku dashed off the deck to the door below and pushed the elevator 
button rapidly, and sniffling slightly. Her face was still stained with 
tears as she began getting aggravated. &quot;Come on you stupid elevator, 
move faster!&quot; The elevator moved at the slowest pace she had ever seen 
it move. Perhaps it was in need of repairs&#39;

When the elevator finally came to a halt at the bridge, Rikku ran out of 
the elevator, almost before the doors even opened and running, leapt 
over the platform infront of her, landing on the floor below.

Everyone turned to look up at her, as she tried to catch her breath. 
&quot;Brother...Dyga sa du dra Sylymyhey Fuutc, huf!&quot; She yelled. Even if she 
was pretty sure Paine wouldn&#39;t be there, perhaps Paine had gotten clumsy 
and left some clues? It was a small chance, but a chance nevertheless..

&quot;Rikku! Fryd dra ramm ec kuehk uh? Oui cdyo eh ouin nuus vun suhdrc yht 
suhdrc, pynamo ayd, ymfyoc lnoehk yht huf oui lusa rana yht tasyht sa du 
dyga oui cusafrana fedr so yencreb? Aqbmyhydeuh, bmayca?&quot; Brother 
screeched out in that annoying, high-pitched voice of his.

&quot;Tu yc E cyo un cu ramb sa...!&quot; She stalked over to him and grabbed him 
by his collar, then whispered something in Al Bhed to him that quickly 
drained the color from his face as he began to shake.

Brother nodded and swallowed hard. Then ran over and threw Buddy out of 
his seat as Buddy looked around dumbfoundedly as he blinked, about to 
speak, until Rikku gave him a malacious glare that sent chills up and 
down his spine.

&quot;H-haqd cdub! Sylymyhey F-Fuutc!&quot; Brother screeched out as he kicked the 
airship into overdrive.

The airship was at the Macalania Travel Agency in no time.

Rikku near about jumped off the airship before it had properly landed 
and ran to the Travel Agency door, banging on it with all her might. 
&quot;O&#39;Aka! O&#39;Aka! Open up dammit!&quot; She screamed at the top of her lungs.

She heard someone running towards the door, apparently in great haste 
and the door flung open.

The person that opened the door was no who she expected. Oh no...it was 
not O&#39;Aka, but Rin the Al Bhed.

Rin looked at her and began speaking. &quot;Rikku? What is the meaning of 
this yelling? Are you in trouble?&quot;

&quot;R-Rin&#39; I thought O&#39;Aka owned this shop!&quot;

&quot;No...Mr. O&#39;Aka has not owned this shop since...hm...since...it&#39;s been 
so long ago I cannot remember...may I be of some service to you, Miss 
Rikku?&quot;

&quot;Maybe! Have you seen a tall lady come through here? Silver hair, red 
eyes, wears all black, carries a biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiggggg sword?&quot; Rikku 
used her arms and hands to comically demonstrate just how big it was.

Rin placed a hand to his chin in thought, before he snapped his fingers, 
causing Rikku&#39;s eyes to light up with happiness.. &quot;Yes, yes..I have..as 
a matter of fact...she was just here...a few hours ago..she often stops 
by to buy potions from me, every few days. She should be through her, in 
a week at the most.&quot; He nodded and smiled at Rikku&#39;s expression.

&quot;Oh my god, Rin, thank you, thank you, thank you so much!&quot; She yelled 
and jumped up, hugging him tightly in a vice like grip. She had the 
biggest smile on her face, ever before seen. And that&#39;s pretty big, if 
you know Rikku like I know Rikku.

Rin gasped for breath as she hugged him with no intentions of letting 
go. &quot;R-Rikku..You are very welcome. I appreciate your thanks to 
me..but..I can&#39;t breath...&quot; His face was slowly turning blue.

Rikku looked at him and blushed,letting go and putting her hands behind 
her back and looking down at the ground, rocking back and forth on her 
heels. &quot;Um..sorry..&quot;

After he finally regained the correct color in his cheeks he smiled and 
patted her shoulder &quot;It&#39;s alrght Rikku. Would you perhaps desire a place 
to rest until she arrives? I see you seem to have plenty of crew. 
Everyone will have their own rooms, of course. There are bathrooms in 
each of the rooms as well. What do you say?&quot;

Rikku rocked back and forth on her heels for a few minutes, before 
finally responding. &quot;That&#39;d be great Mister Rin. Thank you very much for 
helping me out.&quot;

He smiled and spoke. &quot;What is helping one to another when it makes 
everyone happy?&quot;

Rikku smiled and dashed up to the airship, gathering all the crew and 
pointing them towards the Travel Agency.

Brother, Rin, Shinra and Buddy, all caught up on old times, while Rikku, 
brushed her teeth and took a shower. Then got into her night clothes and 
laid in her bed. She would have to stay there for a few days but...it 
was well worth the wait...
