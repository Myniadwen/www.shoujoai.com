<h1>Never Again Will I Slip (part 7 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff102/index.html">Final Fantasy 10-2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jessvolk.html">Jessicka Volkinivia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff102/nevagain-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Rikku awoke with a jolt at a few minutes before daybreak, as she rubbed 
her eyes sleepil, and yawned, covering her mouth with her hand slowly.

She hopped off the deck of the Celcius, and managed to not break any 
bones. Skills on a ninja, or thief, could learn from years and years of 
practice. The Celcius had to, what...at least 15, 20, maybe even 50 feet 
in the air? And better yet, she landed with so much grace and no sound 
at all...what was she...a fricking cat in human disguise?

Well...anyway...back to the stoooorryyyy..

She began creeping quickly but quietly towards the Travel Agency. Good 
thing one of the doors was off-track...or else, she would have had a 
hell of a time getting in, without someone hearing her, since the door 
were a little on the heavy side...

She used her foot to slowly inch the door slowly open and she then 
peeked her head around the door slowly to check out her surroundings.

Brother had fallen asleep at the table..his tongue hanging out and drool 
spots on the tabletop. &quot;Ewww..&quot; Rikku thought to herself and cokced her 
eyes to her other side, to the right side and glanced around.

Buddy was sitting down on the floor, knee out infront of him and his 
head resting on his arms which were folded, resting on his knees, his 
head turned to the side as he slept.

&quot;Hmmm...They&#39;re sleep...I shouldn&#39;t have any trouble getting past 
them...let&#39;s just hoipe I dont make any noise...&quot;

Rikku slowly bent down and removed her shoes then quickly stepped 
through the off-track door and rested her shoes, sideways against the 
one door and slowly inched the other door towards them so that it would 
not make much noise when it closed.

She began tiptoeing towards her room. Just as she was halfway there, 
Buddy, still sleeping, decided to stretch one of his legs out. 
Unfortunately it was the one next to her lead leg as she accidentally 
kicked it.

His head shot up quickly and he looked around, before coming face to 
face with Rikku. He opened his mouth to speak, but right before he did, 
she quickly casted a &quot;sleep&quot; spell on him. As he slowly drifted back to 
sleep, she stopped and listened for a moment, to make sure he was 
actually asleep then began tiptoeing once again.

She looked at her watch as he eyes widened. &quot;Damn..it&#39;s 4:45! Rin will 
be up soon!&quot; At that moment, like anyone who was pressed for time, she 
began to rush, and therefore, started to get careless. She quickly ran 
to her room. Her socked feet patting against the hardwood floor softly, 
as she dashed into her room, forgetting about the entrance alarm that 
Rin had installed the night before. You had to enter a keypad number to 
disarm the alarm.

She screamed and cursed loudly as the alarm started blaring, sounding 
like a cross between an ambulance and a police car. She started jumping 
around and around, screaming &quot;Shut it off, Rin! Shut it offffffff!&quot; Ashs 
eh pouted and began searching through her bags for clothing, food and 
disposable weapons, such as ninja stars, minature daggers, grenades..and 
the item that was normally over looked but highly iomportant in life or 
death situations..the smoke bomb.

She shoved about 5 smoke bombs into her pack, 5 ninja stars, 10 minature 
daggers, which she had coated with poison and 3 grenades, then started 
stuffing her restorative items inside when Rin dashed into her room, 
guin in hand as he looked around for a possible intruder. He started 
walking around the room slowly, then turning quickly and aiming his gun 
in a particular direction (A la Metal Gear Solid). After he took a brief 
look around the room, he stuffed his gun into his back pocket and looked 
at Rikku. &quot;Rikku? Frana ec ra? Frana ec dra ehdnitan?&quot; (Where is he? 
Where is the intruder?&quot;

She looked at him and smiled grimly. &quot;Nekrd...rana...&quot; (Right...here...) 
she said, pointing at herself. Rin ran a hand through his hair 
frustrately &quot;Rikku! Ruf syho desac sicd E damm oui? Drec ymyns cocdas ec 
hud y duo!&quot; (Rikku! How many times must I tell you? This alarm system is 
not a toy!&quot;) She glared and stood up, stalking over to him and drew her 
fist back, as if to hit him. Just as he fist would have connected with 
his face, she felt thin, but strong fingers grasp her wrist. She tried 
to jerk her wrist out of the person&#39;s grip, until she happen to look at 
the hand that held her wrist. Black fingers? No...that must be a 
glove...and the only person that wears black gloves is...

She slowly looked up to meet ruby red colored orbs, attached to a pale 
face and silver hair. It was...it...couldn&#39;t be...could it?

The woman spoke quietly, but in a firm voice. &quot;Calm yourself little 
one!&quot; She looked into Rikku&#39;s eyes, to let her know she meant business, 
then released her grip from her wrist, pushing Rikku&#39;s hand down, 
forcefully away from her and turned towards the doorway, before walking 
down the hall, to her room that she had been occupying for at least a 
week before Rikku showed up.

Rikku&#39;s eyes widening then got smaller in anger. &quot;Rin! Oui moehk cylg uv 
cred! Oui meat du sa! Ruf luimt oui, oui vilgehk pycdynt?&quot; (Rin! You 
lying sack of shit! You lied to me! How could you, you fucking 
bastard!&quot;)

Before he could respond she hit him hard in his face, more precisely, in 
his nose, sending him reeling back to the open doorway across the hall, 
which just happened to be the bathroom. He stumbled backwards, holding 
his nose until he stumbled and fell into the tub, landing on his back. A 
few seconds later, she dived onto him again, punching him repeatly in 
his face, with no regards for where she hit. For a small girl, she 
pakced one hell of a punch!

Buddy and Brother ran to the sound of the commotion, both of them 
grabbing her arms and attempting to lift her off of Rin. As she was 
lifted up, she slammed the back of her head hard into Brother&#39;s nose, 
effectively breaking it as he quickly let go of her arm to attend to his 
broken nose. &quot;AH! Vilg! Vilg! Oui vilgehk pedlr! E&#39;s kuhhy gemm ouin 
cgehho ycc!&quot; (AH! Fuck! Fuck! You fucking bitch! I&#39;m gonna kill your 
skinny ass!&quot;)

Pnudran! Red ran eh dra rayt, bimm ran ryen! Tu cusadre ! YR! CRED! 
(Brother! Hit her in the head, pull her hair! Do somethi ! AH! SHIT!) 
Buddy had started to give suggestion, only to get a hard fist to the 
nads, for his reward as his hands quickly wet to hold his crotch as he 
dropped like a sack of bricks, falling unconscious, immediately.

Brother felt himself get picked up and thrown out on to the floor that 
connected to two rooms to each other and Buddy was scooted out as well, 
still unconscious

Rin&#39;s face was now a bloody mess of...well...nothing. Both of his lips 
were busted and dripped large amounts of blood onto his shirt. Both of 
his eyes were black and his nose was broken in every single place, but 
he was still conscious.

Rikku drew her fist back, about to put him unconscious, when she heard 
the bathroom door close .She began to turn around to see who it was, but 
before she could, a black leather gloved hand grabbed her by her throat 
and before she knew what was going on, the back of her head, came in 
direct, hard contact with the bathroom door, as she winced and tasted 
the familiar, metallic taste of blood in her mouth. The hand around her 
throat, threatened to crush her windpipe as she struggled feebly.

She looked into red orbs and at that moment, the red orbs seem to dance 
like flames as Paine spoke through clinched teeth. &quot;Listen 
here...you...bitch...fighting them...won&#39;t do a damn bit a good...&quot; She 
quickly reached into her side pocket and withdrew a knife, pressing it 
firmly against Rikku&#39;s throat. &quot;I believe the person you have a problem 
with...is me...isn&#39;t that right...little one?&quot; She whispered through 
clinched teeth, as she glimpsed at the blood dripping down Rikku&#39;s neck. 
&quot;Better hurry and answer...you&#39;re life&#39;s a wasting..&quot; Paine chuckled out 
bitterly.

Rikku swallowed hard, forcing a bit more blood out of her throat. Paine 
glared at her. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that if I were you, little one. Just 
answer the fucking question...do you...or do you not...have a problem 
with me?&quot;

Tears flowed from Rikku&#39;s eyes, as she was literally pissing herself, 
trying to think of the best way to answer Paine&#39;s question. She quickly 
opened her mouth and spoke, as a spray of blood flew from her mouth, 
coating Paine&#39;s face as she pissed herself evenmore, scared about what 
Paine might do to her.

Paine&#39;s gloved hand reached up and began wiping the blood off her face, 
before she smiled sweetly at Rikku. &quot;Now...what were you going to say?&quot;

Rikku swallowed the blood in her mouth before responding, nearly pu8king 
from the excess blood hitting her stomach. &quot;Not anymore!&quot; She cried out. 
&quot;Please let me go! Please!&quot; She begged Paine as her face was drenched 
with her own tears.

Paine placed a finger to her lips, in mock thought then responded. 
&quot;Since you begged so nicely...&quot; She slowly removed the blade from 
Rikku&#39;s throat, only to bring the blade down the center of Rikku&#39;s body, 
stopping right above her bellybutton, making a deep cut, as Rikku&#39;s body 
slumped forward onto hers and she pushed her off, causing Rikku&#39;s head 
to hit the tiled floor, hard.

Paine bent down and picked Rikku&#39;s body off the floor and looked at her. 
&quot;That was for the incident in Macalania Woods...&quot; She quickly drew her 
fist back and punched Rikku hard in the jaw, sending her head straight 
into the floor cabinet and then it bounced off, smacking the tiled floor 
again, hard.

&quot;Guess what they say about skinny bitches is true.,..they all are 
airheads...(No offense to anyone skinny out there...male or female..) 
She then leaned down and whispered in Rikku&#39;s ear. &quot;And that...was for 
spitting fucking blood in my face.&quot; She stood up and kicked Rikku&#39;s hard 
in her hard, earning her a satisfying, groan of pain.

She chuckled, then leaned down and held a potion bottle, not even an 
inch a way from her face.

&quot;You want this, little one? Do you?&quot; Rikku&#39;s eyes widened and she raised 
up slowly for her lips to reach the bottle, just as Paine turned the 
bottle upside down on the tiled floor, not even an inch away from Rikku.

&quot;Hmmm...let&#39;s hope you can lick fast enough to say your 
life...though...&quot; Paine placed a finger to her lips. &quot;...you do look 
like you have a fast tongue...you must have practiced alot on Yuna when 
she was around...&quot;

Paine shrugged and turned to open the door, intentionally placing her 
bare feet in the remains of the potion liquid, then turned and walked 
out...leaving Rikku to lick up what was left...hoping to save her 
life...as Rin was still laying in the bathtub...getting a migraine just 
keeping himself conscious.</pre>
