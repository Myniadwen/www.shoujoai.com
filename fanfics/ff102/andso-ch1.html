<h1>And So</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff102/index.html">Final Fantasy 10-2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hwingwhit.html">Heath Wingwhit</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Paine watched Yuna run up to the young, blonde man in the water, 
throwing her arms around him. She was still vaguely surprised at seeing 
Yuna&#39;s daring jump from the Celsius. Then again they&#39;d just defeated 
Vagnagun and Shuyin; a dive into the water wasn&#39;t a big deal after that. 
&quot;So, that&#39;s Him, huh?&quot;

&quot;Yep!&quot; Rikku smiled brightly next to her, looking on at the reunion. 
&quot;Looks a lot like Shuyin, doesn&#39;t he? Cuter, maybe?&quot;

&quot;You really think so?&quot; Paine didn&#39;t look at her.

A smirk. &quot;Maybe I do.&quot;

&quot;Yuna looks happy enough to see him.&quot;

&quot;Understatement-Of-The-Ever prize goes to, drum roll please!!!! Paine!&quot;

&quot;Stop that.&quot;

&quot;Ooh!&quot; Rikku bounced a little, rocking back and forth on her feet. &quot;I 
bet they&#39;re going to have a totally romantic night! It&#39;s about time 
Yunie had some fun! This is so exciting!&quot;

Paine half rolled her eyes at Rikku. You&#39;d think it was her boyfriend 
who&#39;d come back. &quot;I bet it&#39;ll be intimate,&quot; she said dryly. &quot;Nothing 
says romantic evening like being surrounded by an entire village eager 
to get a look at you again.&quot;

&quot;Oh hush!&quot; Rikku frowned. &quot;What would you know of romance?&quot;

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you like to know?&quot; This time it was Paine&#39;s turn to lift her 
lips in a teasing manner.

Rikku stared at her suspiciously. &quot;Hmph, well, we missed the party at 
Luca but we&#39;re not missing this one!&quot; A triumphant fist in the air. 
&quot;Let&#39;s go! I bet they&#39;ll have lots of food ready for tonight and Tidus 
and Yunie&#39;s big return! I can&#39;t wait!&quot; She ran on ahead.

Paine looked after Rikku and sighed. Shrugging a bit, she followed her 
into Besaid.

--

The night had settled in firmly but the party was just starting. A 
feast, drinking, dancing, music, what more could one ask for? As usual 
the bonfire was roaring and Rikku allowed this one to wash away the old 
memory of the past fires, to wipe away the haunting memory of a time 
when it&#39;d been close to the end of Yuna&#39;s journey. To what they had 
thought would mean her death. She forced herself to concentrate on 
happier things, which was quite frankly, at this time, easily done.

The Besaid Aurochs were as happy as anyone else to see Tidus. They made 
a spectacle of showing off their new moves, which sadly weren&#39;t many, if 
any at all. Tidus, cheerful as he was to see them, told them all that 
they were great. Wakka told them not to believe it.

The smile on Wakka&#39;s face almost outshone Yuna&#39;s. Had any of them really 
considered how much Wakka had missed him? They&#39;d been like brothers, 
hadn&#39;t they? And Lulu, just the same as always, but not being able to 
hide the degree of her mirth. To see Tidus again, to have Yuna smile so 
genuinely. That was something to be grateful for.

Tidus couldn&#39;t believe Wakka had a kid. Just like Paine couldn&#39;t believe 
Lulu or Wakka had let Rikku handle him. &quot;I&#39;m careful!&quot; She&#39;d shouted at 
Paine and stuck out her tongue.

&quot;That&#39;s mature,&quot; Paine had responded, but had let it go at that, going 
over to her and looking at the child curiously. It wasn&#39;t that cute, she 
would even go as far as to say that it walked a fine line between &#39;not 
that cute&#39; and &#39;ugly&#39;. Babies weren&#39;t her thing, maybe.

Eventually the festivities began to settle down. People started 
returning to their homes bit by bit until it&#39;d grown much quieter. It 
made the absence seem much too sudden to those who hadn&#39;t paid 
attention.

Still, a few remained circling the fire. They were all in their own 
small groups and Rikku studied them. Watching Lulu and Wakka sit next to 
each other, so intimately. So... so... married like. And Yuna and Tidus, 
along with them, sitting so close to one another. Their hands on the 
ground, clasped. Kimahri and Auron. Sir Jecht, Lord Braska. All of them 
missing but still- this. This was enough.

&quot;You&#39;re being unusually quiet,&quot; Paine told her.

Rikku flicked her eyes to her. Yes, and she, sitting here alongside of 
Paine. She couldn&#39;t figure out if they were out of place or if they fit 
in with the others. &quot;Miss my voice?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t kid yourself.&quot;

Rikku grinned and pulled her knees up to her chest, wrapping her arms 
around her legs loosely. She rested her cheek on her knees. Sighed a 
little.

&quot;Tired?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t fool yourself, there&#39;s plenty of Rikku-pep left in me!&quot; Her voice 
rose though she didn&#39;t shift. Instead she sighed a bit. &quot;I just feel...&quot;

&quot;Out of place?&quot; Paine rolled her head to the side and stood. She didn&#39;t 
spare the setting another glance. &quot;Mad&#39;c ku.&quot;

&quot;Frana?&quot; Rikku shifted immediately back into her mother tongue, feeling 
a warm feeling spread through her at Paine having been the one this time 
to speak to her in Al Bhed.

Paine looked up at the full moon. &quot;You pick.&quot;

Rikku rose slowly and dusted herself off. For some moments she looked at 
the moon with Paine. Too bad they couldn&#39;t go there. Without a word she 
began to walk away from the fire, from the others, from the village. 
Paine walked alongside of her, the both of them silent. Strangely enough 
neither thought to excuse themselves to the others.

--

&quot;All partied out?&quot; Paine asked Rikku while they walked up the hill in 
the dark. The two of them listened to the grass crunch under their feet. 
The way the pebbles slid down the patches of dirt, the manner in which 
the dirt moved around their footsteps. There was chirping too, a quiet 
sound that was almost lonely. Paine didn&#39;t know what it was.

&quot;Just about,&quot; Rikku stretched her arms over her head.

&quot;Or maybe you just don&#39;t have the energy to keep smiling so cheerfully 
at the other couples.&quot; A light scoff. &quot;I don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;You rarely smile, Paine. Anyway, I know deep down you&#39;re happy for 
them.&quot;

&quot;Of course I am,&quot; she said as if to suggest otherwise was ridiculous. 
&quot;But also bored.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what happens in a little place like Besaid. You grow up, you 
pick a trade and then you get married and have kids.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not from here.&quot;

&quot;Me too.&quot;

They exchanged looks for a moment and then looked away before continuing 
to walk under the fallen ruins and over the wooden bridge. &quot;So what 
happens now,&quot; Paine asked. Rikku looked at her strangely, perhaps 
flustered. She continued. &quot;I know what Yuna said on The Celsius, but 
that was before she knew he was back.&quot;

&quot;Ooh... poopie...you&#39;re right...&quot; Rikku put a finger to her chin in 
thought. &quot;Think she&#39;ll leave the Gullwings?&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Paine shook her head. &quot;She got what she&#39;s looking for. Him. 
And she&#39;s fought so much. And for everyone. She deserves a rest. To have 
fun and live her own life, for once.&quot;
&quot;I know,&quot; Rikku said gloomily. And indeed she did know. Still.

&quot;Even when we were sphere hunting she ran around doing errands for 
people-&quot;

&quot;And taking us for the ride.&quot;

&quot;And we missed out on other jobs. On spheres, on gil and other 
opportunities.&quot;

&quot;If you tell me you&#39;re complaining I won&#39;t believe it.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not the point, Rikku.&quot; She stopped and looked at her. &quot;You know 
what I mean.&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes, you&#39;re right, you&#39;re right, as usual.&quot; Rikku crossed her 
arms. The wind was beginning to pick up and it was growing chilly in the 
night hour. &quot;It&#39;s just that... well, she&#39;s Yunie. If she does go,&quot; and 
she probably would- &quot;I&#39;ll miss her.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure everyone on The Celsius will.&quot;

Rikku didn&#39;t know why Paine couldn&#39;t just say that she&#39;d miss Yuna, too. 
&quot;But you&#39;re right. Maybe Yunie&#39;s story isn&#39;t always about saving the 
world from being blown up. Maybe it&#39;ll involve little day to day 
activities. Her big romance with Tidus, all of that.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Paine said non-committally. &quot;Either way it&#39;s up to her, not us. 
Whatever decision she comes to, we have to stand by her.&quot;

&quot;I know that! She&#39;s my cousin, Paine!&quot; Rikku stomped her foot into the 
ground. Really, Paine talking to her as if she didn&#39;t know Yuna. As if 
she didn&#39;t know how to sacrifice for Yuna as if she didn&#39;t know to put 
her first. Hmph. Paine was so dense.

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t think it from the way you act,&quot; there was a small smile 
and then she went on ahead.

Rikku fought to not chase after her but did, eventually.

--

They sat at the grassy cliff where Wakka had once informed Rikku he&#39;d 
pushed Tidus off of while he&#39;d been standing at the edge, looking into 
the waters unsuspectingly.

&quot;What about you, Paine?&quot; Rikku asked as she dangled her feet over the 
edge.

&quot;What about me?&quot; As usual, irritation laced her voice. She didn&#39;t like 
talking about herself. Past found out or no, there were some things that 
took a while to get over.

&quot;Will you be going?&quot;

Paine paused in swinging her legs to and fro from the cliff. &quot;I don&#39;t 
know. Who&#39;s ever sure what lies in store for the future?&quot;

Her voice was so soft. Rikku couldn&#39;t make herself look at her. She bit 
her lip, just slightly. &quot;Well,&quot; she was sulky. &quot;I&#39;m not going anywhere.&quot;

&quot;Relax; I didn&#39;t say I would immediately, if at all. We&#39;re still young. 
I&#39;m sure there are other adventures to be had.&quot;

Rikku brightened, considerably. &quot;That&#39;s the spirit!&quot; She clapped a hand 
to Paine&#39;s back, feeling reassured that Paine wouldn&#39;t leave soon. Her 
eyes doubled when Paine was suddenly not there. When her fingers were 
dancing in the air where Paine had previously sat. And then there was 
the sound of a splash. &quot;Eep...&quot;

Moments later: &quot;RIKKU!&quot;

Rikku could honestly say she&#39;d never heard Paine sound so aggravated or 
angry before. &quot;Oh, boy...&quot; Closing her eyes she did a back flip off the 
edge into the water. She was sure that she would be in for a world of 
hurt, Paine style.

--

The water was colder than it should have been. Rikku had forgotten that 
water cooled at night and that the sun not shining on it for hours upon 
hours a day would affect its temperature.

When she&#39;d landed in the water she&#39;d swam to the surface quickly and 
looked for Paine but couldn&#39;t find her. &quot;Paine?&quot; No response. Oh, jeez. 
Again, with more pep. &quot;Dr. P! I need a checkup!&quot; Nothing. Rikku gulped. 
She hoped there wasn&#39;t some freaky water monster fiend in here that had 
eaten Paine... that would really suck!

Her eyes scanned the dark best as they could. Searched the shadows and 
the rocks for her but still couldn&#39;t find the silver haired warrior. 
&quot;This isn&#39;t funny!&quot; She yelled and listened to her voice bounce back at 
her, distorting the voice, making it sound frightened.

Taking a deep breath she sunk under water and swam around for a few 
minutes searching for her. She wasn&#39;t under the waters either. Rikku 
kicked to the surface and spun in a lazy circle, fighting to get the 
beads of water and strands of blonde away from her face, from her eyes 
that might aid her in her search.

&quot;Boo.&quot;

Whispered in her ear from just behind her. Rikku screamed.

Paine laughed and jabbed her index finger at the thief&#39;s forehead. &quot;Why 
Rikku, I didn&#39;t know former guardians screamed that loudly.&quot;

She whirled in the water. Watched how the platinum strands fell down 
over Paine&#39;s pale face. The way it framed it, looking much longer that 
one would think, reaching to her shoulders. It looked good that way, 
too, Rikku thought. Though she didn&#39;t say this, couldn&#39;t help her anger. 
&quot;You big jerk!&quot; Rikku pushed at her shoulder, glowering heatedly. &quot;You 
really scared me, ya know!&quot;

&quot;That was the whole point,&quot; Paine said with a faint smile on her lips. 
&quot;I hadn&#39;t been expecting on taking a late night swim tonight,&quot; she 
pushed back the pale strands from her face.

&quot;And if you had, would you have brought your swimsuit and hidden in the 
shadows somewhere?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that mean?&quot; Paine asked in a bored tone.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m just remembering a certain swim we took in the hot springs in 
Mount Gagazet and how you wouldn&#39;t even come near Yunie and me.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t like being ogled.&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t ogling you,&quot; Rikku screamed in a shrill tone.

&quot;Sure,&quot; she joked.

The two of them looked at one another and then looked away 
simultaneously, watching the trees that hung above them. The way the 
waters moved in small waves around them.

&quot;It may be a boring place but the people here are like family to Yuna. 
And it is beautiful. I can see why she&#39;d like it here.&quot; Paine turned on 
her back, swimming back lazily, still staring up at the moon.

&quot;It&#39;s kinda strange to hear you talk like that,&quot; Rikku swam in place, 
watching her.

Paine righted herself. &quot;Is it, really?&quot;

&quot;Yeah- not bad but.&quot;

Paine arched an eyebrow. &quot;This water&#39;s cold. Let&#39;s get out of here 
before we get sick.&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot; Rikku burrowed her eyebrows in disappointment and led them to 
the exit.

--

They were still dripping water when they returned to the village. The 
fire still crackled gently but the others were gone.

&quot;Guess they went to bed without us,&quot; Rikku said, folding her arms behind 
her head.

&quot;I can see our presence was direly missed.&quot;

&quot;Aww, is Paine all upset because she&#39;s not the center of attention 
anymore?&quot;

&quot;When have I been the center of attention?&quot;

Rikku said nothing but skipped over to the bonfire. There were a few 
abandoned blankets and Rikku smoothed a pair out close to the fire and 
sat down atop of one. She patted the spot next to her and grudgingly 
Paine moved over and sat next to her. &quot;Don&#39;t they know about fire 
hazards? Maybe Wakka really did want to burn the temple down and the 
village along with it.&quot;

&quot;Oh shush, you grouch. Do you always have to complain? Besides, look, 
they have stones around it. I mean, Wakka might be dumb as a rock but 
he&#39;s not that dumb.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure he appreciates your support.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure he does,&quot; Rikku said brightly, earnestly. She sniffled and 
inched closer to the fire. Her skin still shone from the water and she 
rubbed at her arms absentmindedly.

Paine, feeling a pang of sympathy for the always underdressed warrior, 
picked out a nearby blanket and shook away the leaves and grass before 
wrapping it around Rikku&#39;s slender shoulders. She stared into the fire 
as the piercing green eyes attempted to meet hers. &quot;I don&#39;t want to 
catch a cold off of you,&quot; she explained.

There was a moment of silence. Rikku put her usual teasing to the side 
this once. &quot;Right. Thanks.&quot;

A gruff &#39;you&#39;re welcome&#39;.

The snapping of the fire continued in muted tones, weaving a slow dance 
for the last two witnesses. &quot;It&#39;s real quiet, huh?&quot;
&quot;It was,&quot; Paine replied.

Rikku didn&#39;t let it faze her. &quot;Are you cold?&quot;

&quot;Just a little.&quot;

&quot;Maybe we should share my blanket?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s okay,&quot; a bit of a side long smile that made Rikku pause. &quot;But 
thanks.&quot;

&quot;Have it your way,&quot; Rikku said perkily. &quot;I&#39;ll have you know most people 
would love to share a blanket with me.&quot;

&quot;Is that so?&quot;

&quot;It is.&quot;

&quot;Lucky for me I&#39;m not &#39;most people&#39;.&quot;

Rikku looked at her. &quot;No,&quot; she said slowly, as if recognizing it for the 
first time. &quot;You aren&#39;t.&quot;

The two looked steadily at one another for a long time. A challenge, 
maybe. It was what they both made it. An excuse. A reason not to look 
away.

Paine wasn&#39;t the kind to back down. Rikku wasn&#39;t the type to give up. So 
it lasted longer than it might have under normal circumstances, or if 
others had been present. Paine counted how many times the swirls in 
Rikku&#39;s eyes looped. Rikku found all the things she knew of and listed 
them off in her mind, all the things that were the exact shade of 
Paine&#39;s eyes.

The blanket made a small rustling sound as it fell from Rikku&#39;s 
shoulders. Paine&#39;s breath hitched. In surprise, fright. Maybe in 
anticipation.

Neither had expected to be so near to one another. Rikku herself 
wouldn&#39;t be able to tell the point in which she&#39;d moved closer. In which 
her hand had covered Paine&#39;s under the fallen blanket. The squelched and 
unknown delight she felt that Paine hadn&#39;t pulled it away.

It was a surprise to them that their skin was still cold, damp from the 
swim, that the others&#39; lips could be so soft. That they could kiss like 
this, at first scared, apprehensively, experimentally, before becoming 
real, slow and gentle like a hymn.

There was a spark that stirred them that hadn&#39;t been there before.

Rikku&#39;s fingertips touched lightly on Paine&#39;s face, and she felt Paine&#39;s 
hand on her shoulder.

Paine didn&#39;t know whether it was to push her away or to pull her closer.

For that small time all they knew was each other&#39;s touch, and taste and 
kiss.

When they pulled away, their breath spilled over the other, warming them 
in a way the fire hadn&#39;t been able to. And they were still so close. 
Lips separated but still so close that it could begin again. Their 
chests heaved lightly as they tried to collect their breath.

&quot;Are you cold?&quot; Rikku asked again. Her voice, so quiet, trembled.

&quot;I-&quot; Paine fought for language, begged it to return to her. She was 
always one of few words but now she wanted them back, wanted to say 
something, anything. The answer might have changed from last time. 
Perhaps she should let Rikku know that. &quot;Don&#39;t know.&quot; How could she not 
know? &quot;Why?&quot;

Rikku swallowed. &quot;You&#39;re shivering.&quot;</pre>
