<span name="storytext" id="storytext">The first of Rikku's senses to return  to her was her hearing, the off key singing of someone, soon  identified as Yuna, coming from somewhere behind her, sounding a  little muffled. She decided that her cousin must be singing in the  bathtub, internally smirking at the thought that despite Yuna's  usually wonderful singing voice, she still sounded bad in the  bathroom. Rikku's eyes felt heavy, so she ignored the want to open  them for the moment, instead focusing on the feeling and smells that  came to her at about the same time. It certainly wasn't her pillow  she was curled against, the softness of a different sort, with a  second texture mixed in. This confused Rikku, and she wasn't quite  able to tell what it was. The scent of the sea was strong, a fresh  scent mingled with the smell of a warm breeze, a familiar, comforting  smell. Her sleep confused mind couldn't put anything together no  matter how she try, so with a soft sigh she forced her eyes to open,  squinting at the light.
<p>A blush quickly rose to her cheeks as  she found herself looking directly at leather clad cleavage, the  unmistakable silver cross clasp quickly identifying her 'pillow' as  Paine. Rikku briefly let herself be a little mesmerized by the slow  rise and fall of Paine's breathing, her eyes eventually slowly  traveling upwards. Granted, she had been this close to the warrior  yesterday on the island, but she was also in a lot of pain, and  didn't have the opportunity to enjoy the view, so to speak, and was  taking the opportunity to do so now as her eyes took in little  details. The curve of her shoulder, the line of her neck and jaw, and  finally, Rikku's emerald eyes settled on Paine's face. She smiled at  the peaceful expression of the sleeping warrior, marveling at how  gentle she appeared. Rikku knew that under the battle hardened  exterior was a kind, gentle soul, and she was determined to work her  way through and expose it back to the light of day so it could be  seen other than just when Paine was asleep.</p>
<p>Rikku shifted her head to gently rest  it on Paine's shoulder, watching the slow pulse of her relaxed  heartbeat, admiring Paine's pale skin. She brought her arm up, her  hand shaking a little as her arm was still rather sore, glancing at  her wrist and arm as she realized that it was healed, for the most  part. Flexing a little, she nodded in approval and turned her eyes  back to Paine, bringing her hand down to softly rest on the warrior's  breastbone, eying the different skin tones. Her skin was always  tanned, naturally darker like the rest of her tribe, a little moreso  from time spent outside. Paine, by comparison, was paler than Yuna,  but still a healthy color. Rikku idly wondered if it was connected to  her silvery hair and red eyes, but decided that she didn't care,  liking it either way. She furrowed her brow slightly as she noticed  the bit of redness at Paine's collarbone and neck, glancing up at the  woman's face, a blush quickly coating her cheeks as her eyes met  Paine's wide open ones, she blushing as well. Both women looked  initially like they wanted to move away and pretend nothing happened,  but the longer neither moved, the less of an urge that became.</p>
<p>Paine was the first to find her voice,  her tone soft. &quot;Uh, hey...how's your arm feeling?&quot;</p>
<p>Rikku reflexively glanced down at her  arm still resting across Paine's chest, her blush growing a little  darker and heating her ears. Shaking slightly, she gently clenched  her hand into a fist. &quot;Still sore, and kind of shaky, but a  thousand times better.&quot; A thought struck her, and she quickly  looked up again. &quot;You set it, didn't you?&quot;</p>
<p>Paine arched an eyebrow smoothly. &quot;Yes,  but why did you think that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because Barkeep wouldn't have  thought to have someone cast Sleep on me first.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You noticed that, huh?&quot;</p>
<p>Rikku laughed lightly, a sound that  made Paine get a little thrill inside, so happy to hear it again,  though she kept it from her expression. &quot;I've been running  around Spira for a while, Paine, I've had all manner of things cast  on me. You get to learn what a few are just from the first touch of  magic before they take affect.&quot;</p>
<p>Turning her gaze upwards for a few  moments, Paine considered this, then nodded lightly. &quot;Yes, I  suppose that's true.&quot;</p>
<p>Faintly biting her lower lip, Rikku  fell silent for a moment, then leaned up and softly kissed Paine's  cheek, smiling inwardly as she felt the shiver it sent through Paine,  who managed to not show too much of a reaction to this, despite her  cheeks blushing a little darker. &quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>Paine shifted about, suddenly having  lost most of her earlier resolve. &quot;Eh, you'd do the same for me  afterall.&quot;</p>
<p>Rikku shrugged slightly, faintly  grimacing at the motion, and lightly, reluctantly, moved from Paine's  side, feeling the woman's discomfort and not wishing to be the cause  of it. &quot;Maybe, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't thank you  anyway...&quot;</p>
<p>Paine sat up and adjusted her shawl a  little, the blush still on her cheeks, but slowly fading. She lightly  cleared her throat, and looked back to Rikku. Her thoughts were in  turmoil, Rikku able to see this in the shine of Paine's eyes.  Glancing away again as she stood from the bed to stand next to it,  she cleared her throat lightly once more. &quot;You're welcome.&quot;</p>
<p>Flexing her arm again to work out the  stiffness, Rikku nodded lightly, her eyes trained down on her hand as  she flexed it into a fist and relaxed it again. &quot;..I knew you'd  search for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well of course, Yuna's your  cousin afterall...&quot; Paine trailed off as Rikku shook her head  vehemently and looked up, her eyes briefly flashing.</p>
<p>&quot;Not Yuna. You, Paine. I knew that  you'd search for me.&quot; The conviction in her voice was strong,  her gaze unwavering as she focused on the warrior.</p>
<p>Paine paused, her first words caught in  her throat. She cursed inwardly as her instincts told her to turn and  run, to not say anything, to just go. But she had to admit to  herself, that if she did such a thing, she'd hate herself forever for  letting the opportunity pass. So instead, she simply nodded lightly,  trying to relax her tense muscles. &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>Rikku, an expert in running away from  dangerous situations, could tell that Paine wanted to go, a little  triumphant moment for her as she watched the warrior decide it was  better to stay. She pushed back her own nervousness as she glanced  over at the door to the bathroom, shifting forward on the bed to sit  on the edge of it in front of Paine. Reaching up, she gently took  Paine's hand in both of hers, looking down at the glove that covered  it. Faintly biting her lower lip, she slid the glove away, Paine's  hand shaking faintly before she lightly clenched it into a fist.  Rikku slipped her fingers between Paine's and gently squeezed,  closing her eyes for a few moments. Hoping almost beyond reason that  she knew the answer already, she rested her forehead to the back of  the warriors strong hand before asking. &quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>For the second time in as many days,  Paine felt the world slow to nearly a stop, this time triggered by  Rikku's words instead of the sight of her falling. She reflexively  squeezed Rikku's hand tightly, using the girl as an anchor, as a  reason to not run. &quot;I...I couldn't bear the thought of having to  let you go.&quot; She raised her other hand up and gently touched  Rikku's lips as she looked up, silencing the question she could see  in the shining emerald eyes.  &quot;I...fayth, this isn't easy for  me, Rikku...&quot; Paine knelt down next to the bed, keeping Rikku's  hands held in hers.</p>
<p>Rikku nodded lightly, softly kissing  the back of Paine's bare hand. &quot;I know..&quot; She dared not  move or do anything further, a part of her feeling like she was  approaching a wounded animal that might snap at any moment and bite  her.</p>
<p>Paine glanced up as she heard Yuna  shuffling around a bit more in the bathroom, and the door to the  cabin open, Buddy speaking with Oaka and Barkeep. She faintly bit her  lower lip for a moment before regaining her stoic appearance, her  voice low. &quot;Buddy said we were going to stop in Besaid so he and  Brother can take a boat to Luca and get other items to fix the  airship, and we can recuperate from all...this. Can..can we talk  there?&quot; She took a deep breath. &quot;Please, Rikku..&quot;</p>
<p>Softly pressing her lips to the back of  Paine's knuckles again, Rikku closed her eyes, then nodded, glancing  over towards the railing and glaring at Buddy's voice. &quot;Yeah.  This isn't going to be a short conversation, is it?&quot;</p>
<p>Paine offered a soft smile as she  stood, taking her glove and slipping it back on, shaking her head.  &quot;No, I don't think so.&quot; She smirked, and Rikku knew things  were alright. &quot;If you weren't so lazy...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey! You cast -Sleep- on me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You complain as much as Brother  sometimes, you think I wanted to hear you?&quot; Paine's eyes shone  with dual relief and a tiny bit of worry over what was to come, but  she wasn't about to pass over an opportunity to tease Rikku.</p>
<p>&quot;What? Why you...&quot; Rikku  grabbed a pillow and tossed it at Paine, the tall woman chuckling as  she easily dodged the soft projectile, and turned to head down the  stairs.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm glad you're okay, Rikku.  Don't be so clumsy next time.&quot; Paine smirked as she got hit in  the back with another pillow, and kept going down into the bar. Buddy  looked up towards her as she descended the stairs, opening his mouth  to say something before Yuna's excited squeal caught both of their  attention as the Gunner ran across the top level of the cabin and  over to Rikku, Paine shaking her head as the cousins started to  babble to each other, Yuna crying as she expressed her relief at  seeing Rikku awake and okay, Rikku trying to get her cousin to relax.</p>
<p>Buddy shook his head and smiled,  offering Paine a piece of the bread he had. &quot;That's a nice sound  to hear again, huh?&quot;</p>
<p>Paine waved off the offering, her face  having switched back to her usual stoic and unemotional state, though  Buddy could see the difference in her eyes. &quot;Yeah, it is, though  now we'll all get headaches again...&quot; She turned and walked out  of the cabin, leaving the navigator wondering.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The trip to Besaid was almost  agonizingly slow, the ship not able to get airborne and having to  travel by water. Yuna was on the verge of driving Rikku nuts, a role  reversal, the gunner seeming to have felt that Rikku's injury was  somehow her fault, constantly asking Rikku if her arm was okay, if  she needed anything, and generally driving the young Al-bhed nuts.  She would tell Yuna time and again that she was alright, the young  girl usually being eternally patient with the former summoner, her  familial and guardian instincts strong, but even she reached a point  where she had to get away some. Rikku had even taken up going onto  the Bridge more often, helping Brother and Buddy with fixing the  pilots chair, Brother having to take over Rikku's co-pilot station to  drive the ship in the meantime. Yuna would hover nearby, looking a  little lost as the three Al-bhed would jabber on in their native  language, and Shinra would ignore everyone, leaving Yuna watching the  scenery pass through the great glass windows at the front of the  Bridge.
<p>Paine would quietly watch, as she was  wont to do, her attention shifting between Rikku, and Yuna. It struck  her that perhaps she should talk to Yuna about things of the  more...romanic side, knowing that love really was the main reason she  was on the airship in the first place, and Paine was woefully  inexperienced in this particular realm. But the more she thought  about it, the more she realized that she likely shouldn't, since  there was no way that she could talk about her dilemma in a vague  enough way that wouldn't clue Yuna in to the fact that Paine was  enamored with her cousin. She didn't know how Yuna felt about two  women pairing, despite the very brief conversation on the island, let  alone her cousin, one of the few family members that she had left,  and she also didn't know how Rikku would feel about her talking about  it.</p>
<p>With a faint sigh, Paine turned and  walked from the Bridge, pushing the button and waiting for the lift  to arrive, crossing her arms over her chest as she resisted the urge  to be irritated with the machinia's slowness. She knew that  everything on the ship was working a little slow due to the engine  trouble, making the already sluggish lift even more so. When it  arrived, she pushed the button for the Deck, leaning back against the  lift wall and closing her eyes, clearing her mind of thought as well  as she could as the lift brought her to the Deck.</p>
<p>Stepping out into the cool afternoon  air, Paine walked slowly out into the smooth deck surface. She  couldn't help but look down at the deep wound her sword had inflicted  on the metal that day that Rikku fell, her eyes trailing over to the  two shallow marks where Rikku's daggers caused the metal to scream.  Crouching down, she reached out and softly touched the marks from the  daggers. Almost every day since getting Rikku back, she came up to  the deck, trying to see if there was anything she could have done  differently, to see if it really was out of her control. Logic and  the evidence proved that she had indeed done all that she could, but  despite all that, Paine couldn't shake the feeling of guilt that  still prevailed, and it was driving her nuts. She was supposed to  have control of her emotions, not them having control of her.</p>
<p>&quot;Dammit, do I love her or do I  just feel guilty when I can't protect her from getting hurt? And is  that caused by me loving her or just being protective of a partner?  And if it's just a partner thing, why don't I feel like that for  Yuna?&quot; Paine made a sound of frustration, running her fingers  through her hair, standing and pacing towards the end of the airship,  standing at the side of the Gull that was perched at the front of the  ship, resting her hand against the birds beak. She tried to think  back to a time where she was as angry with a fiend for hurting Yuna,  and try as she might, the only times that she felt anything more than  what one would upon seeing a friend get hurt was when both Yuna and  Rikku would be poisoned or taken down by something. That wasn't to  say that she didn't care about Yuna as a friend, she would grow quite  aggravated whenever the former summoner got hurt, but it didn't  affect her as much as she could see that it would affect Rikku.</p>
<p>&quot;Bah.&quot; Paine ran her fingers  through her hair again, then looked down at her hand. She could still  'feel' where Rikku had kissed it, smirking faintly to herself as the  brief, childlike consideration had gone through her head where she  thought about never washing it again, but quickly went past that  idea. Sliding off her glove, she touched her knuckles with her  fingertips, her mind filling in the image of Rikku sitting in front  of her and holding her hand. &quot;I'm acting like a little  kid...no...not a little kid, like some..some...&quot;</p>
<p>With a huff, Paine sat down hard on the  deck. &quot;..Like some lovestruck fool.&quot; Pulling her glove back  on, she sulked under the shade of the gulls wing, feeling the  occasional cool spray of the ocean waves as they were splashed up by  the motions of the ship. It had been a very long time since Paine had  let her emotion get a hold of her, and she reflected on the reasons  why. Being hurt, losing control, worrying bout someone other than  herself, they were all things that bothered the silver-haired woman  almost beyond reason. Her childhood wasn't rough, at least, what she  remembered of it. There was a block, a wall, a period of time that  she just couldn't access. She knew that before it, she was a  relatively normal kid, at least as normal as one could be in Sin-era  Spira, lived in a small village. But quite abruptly, her memories  were of a solitary life, a rougher life, and she was as she was now,  in control, and safe behind her walls.</p>
<p>&quot;But walls can make for lonely  places.&quot; Paine quietly mused, glancing about the empty deck. She  wanted to talk to someone, but there was no one on this ship she  could. Maybe she could get in contact with someone via the sphere  network, but the question would then become 'who'. She thought to the  limited people in her life who she might be able to talk to about  such things, and came up with a list of approximately three. Nooj,  who would be a bad choice, just out of principal. He was too stoic,  and come on, Leblanc? His taste sure was questionable. Baralai, he  was another no. He was likely irritated that they had given the  sphere to Nooj, and he occasionally was -way- too observant and could  pick out things about her that she much rather that people didn't  know. Gippal, then. Paine started to laugh, quickly silencing it  behind her hand and glancing back behind her, not wanting anyone to  hear her laugh like that. Besides all of that, no one on the ship  knew that she knew them, and she wanted to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Paine made another aggravated sound and  stood, turning and walking closer to the middle of the Deck, drawing  her sword and swinging it around some. It certainly wasn't something  that she wanted to do alone, but like everything else, she supposed  that it was the only way to do it. A faint smile drifted across her  features as she thought of how, if things went right, she wouldn't be  quite so alone anymore.</p>
<p>Now if only the ship would hurry up and  get to Besaid, she could hurry up and stall some more once there.</p>
