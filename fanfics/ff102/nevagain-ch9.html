<h1>Never Again Will I Slip (part 9 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff102/index.html">Final Fantasy 10-2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jessvolk.html">Jessicka Volkinivia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff102/nevagain-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Paine walked into the woods at a faster pace than she intended to. Not 
because she was running but because...well...ok...maybe she was running 
slightly...even as much as she did love Rikku...Rikku could be a bitch 
at times...and back there...that was one of the times..

About halfway into the woods she stopped by her cabin, and opened the 
door, closing it behind her, before she heard a faint sound of footsteps 
that were seemingly very, very close behind her...almost as if in the 
cabin with her...

On instinct she retrieved a tiny razor blade from one of her gloves, 
readying herself for the intruder to strike.

As soon as she felt the timing was right she pivoted quickly on her left 
foot, striking quickly at the unwanted visitor, sinking her blade deeply 
in...air?

She blinked quickly and looked for a moment. &quot;What the hell? I could 
have sworn...&quot; She shook her head and sighed slightly &quot;..Paine...you&#39;re 
losing it...get your act together..&quot;

As she turned back around to face her bed, she felt her windpipe being 
cut off with deft ease, yet with a gentle hand. She would have gasped, 
if she could, but seeing as a hand was firmly, yet gently around her 
throat she could not.

Paine looked to the intruder and blinked a few times...a woman...? The 
woman before her was around 5&#39;7 and weighed maybe...oh...135 pounds at 
the most. Somewhere around her same body structure, yet the woman had 
blue hair with silver streaks in it, silver eyes and a cosume that Paine 
had only seen in the movies...looking amazing similiar to a Ninja 
outfit. Black and form fitting, complete with the mask that covered the 
woman&#39;s mouth and nose. The girl was wearing a pair of, seemingly heavy, 
yet made very little sound, combat boots. To the untrained ear, they 
would have never heard her.

The woman placed a finger to Paine&#39;s lips and spoke gently, with a firm 
yet soft whisper. &quot;It is very dangerous here...no longer are there weak 
Coyotes around...there are powerful Mages and Golems inhabiting this 
place..I can help you out of here...if you&#39;d like...or...you could die 
on your own...what will it be...?&quot;

Paine narrowed her eyes at the woman and tried to thrust her off of her, 
but to no avail. Despite her size, the girl felt like she 
weighed...well...as much as a sack of bricks (No offense to any BBW 
reading this)

The girl grabbed Paine by the back of her hair and shoved her to the 
nearby window. &quot;Look..&quot;

After Paine stumbled towards the window, nearly falling face first into 
it, she glared at the girl, who looked very disinterested in the look 
that Paine gave her...which would have frozen the blood of the largest 
man, this side of Spira.

Placing her hands solidly on the frame of the window, she looked out, 
the sight before her sending goosebumps up and down her spine: Powerful 
spellcasters were obliterating several acres of land and trees with a 
measely fire spell. Golems were pushing down yards of trees as easily as 
she opened and closed a door, and Coyotes giving off a deep redish glow 
and began decimating trees with their teeth and claws in a matter of 
seconds. If there was only one moment in her life that Paine was 
obviously scared...this was one of them..

She heard a slight screeching sound and nearly jumped out of her skin 
before turning to look at the girl, dragging her bed away from the 
floor, revealing a large, and seemingly deep hole, that she had no idea 
where it led to.

The ninja crossed her arms over her chest and leaned against the nearby 
wall. &quot;Have you seen enough...or do you need to see more to convince 
you...? Either way...&quot; She walked over to the hole and jumped in, 
without a moment&#39;s hesitation.

Paine gritted her teeth and sighed. &quot;Let&#39;s just hope I don&#39;t meet 
another Venagun reincarnate...&quot; She grabbed her sword and her bag and 
took a deep breath, jumped in behind the girl.

As Paine fell and fell, it seemed like she would not stop falling. The 
worse thing was...she could not see the bottom. &quot;Oh jeez...what have I 
gotten myself int..!&quot; Before she could finish her sentence she landed 
heavily into the arms of the ninja girl, who sat her down quietly then 
slide slowly along one of the walls, peeking around the corner then 
pulled a shruiken from her breast pocket and threw it, quickly into one 
of the walls down the hall. As she did a rockwall infront of her opened 
up and she reached for Paine&#39;s hand, and dashed off to the wall opening, 
all but dragging Paine behind her.

After they got inside the girl spoke again. &quot;The opening is only open 
for a matter of seconds...if you don&#39;t make it in time, the wall will 
crush you..&quot;

&quot;Either that or you have to wait another month to trigger it open 
again..&quot; A voice sounded behind them.

Paine peered over the female ninja&#39;s shoulder to see another person, 
shrouded in the same outfit.

The girl ran up to her and hugged her tightly &quot;Sister..Sorry I&#39;m late..I 
ran into some complications along the way and I had to save her from 
some stuff.&quot;

The sister smiled and hugged back. &quot;It&#39;s alright..now attend to your 
duties...&quot; She smacked her sister firmly on the butt, leaving a hand 
print on the black outfit.

As she watched her sister walk off, she turned her gaze to Paine and 
crossed her arms. &quot;I am the leader of my group. You will refer to me as 
only that...nothing more...nothing less...do you understand?&quot;

Paine glared at the girl and raised her voice to a harsh whisper. 
&quot;Listen here..she saved me from some massacre out there...I did not 
intend to be drug into some stupid cult of wanna-be ninjas. Show me the 
way out and I will be on my way!&quot;

The leader of the group shook her head. &quot;My sister never misjudges a 
person with talent..&quot; She clapped her hands loudly 4 times in rapid 
succession, as Paine watched, then saw the girl that had saved her, 
clear miles and miles of dirt, rock, gravel and large cliffs in a matter 
of seconds before she stopped by her sister&#39;s side. &quot;Yes, Leader?&quot; The 
girl spoke.

&quot;Perhaps you misjudged this one?&quot; She said, nodding towards Paine.

Amy, the ninja girl looked Paine up and down quickly, then spoke. 
&quot;Perhaps I did...if she wants to leave...&quot;

Lucinile, the leader of the group, shook her head then cracked her neck 
softly. &quot;I&#39;ll show her the way out.&quot;

She walked up to Paine and looked at her for a moment. &quot;You did not 
misjudge her potential...she just has yet to allow it to be released..&quot; 
With that she tossed a smoke bomb onto the ground, and within a matter 
of seconds Paine was opening her eyes and looked around, almost as if 
scared...children playing...someone kicking a blitzball 
around...ships...the ocean...? &quot;...Luca?&quot; Paine gasped out softly.

Lucinile nodded slowly and spoke &quot;You need to allow yourself to reach 
your full potential...only then will you be able to conquer 
everything...&quot; Slowly, water began to rise up from the ocean and 
seemingly mold itself to the girl as she seemed to disintegrate. Just 
before she completely disappeared she said one final thing. &quot;When the 
time is right...you will return to us..&quot; And then she was gone. Paine 
saw the water rise from the ocean, though the pier was completely 
sawdust dry now.

Paine looked around for a few seconds then spoke &quot;How the.,..?&quot;</pre>
