&quot;Honey, now if I&#39;m honest
I still don&#39;t know what love is...&quot;
The Other Side, David Gray

------------------------------------

True to the word of the mechanic in Cosmo Canyon, the buggy was up and 
running as good as before, if not better. He and the hulking muscle mass 
that was Barrett talked for a while about engines, oils and petrol 
types. She purposefully didn&#39;t pay them too much attention, riveted on 
writing in her little journal with her cramped if neat writing. 
Sometimes, either one of Cloud, Yuffie or Tifa would try and casually 
walk close to peer at what it was she committed to paper, but each time 
she shooed them away with a little swipe of her staff, handily laid out 
by her.

When the mechanic finally left and Barrett spent a few more minutes 
discussing minor seating arrangements, they all crammed back into the 
buggy with far less success than they had some days: most of which was 
blamed on Yuffie&#39;s sticky fingered acquisition of anything not nailed 
down. Anything on fire was reasonable fair game, as long as an 
extinguisher was close to hand. Aerith found her self, much to an 
extended fit of giggles, squished between Red who kept huffing at her 
elbow when the vehicle jolted them about unmercifully, and Cloud who 
kept trying to hold her hand, much to the distraught glares of Tifa.

On the second day, Tifa elbowed Cloud from the way and claimed the spot 
by Aerith with Red, still being elbowed in the nose no matter how much 
she tried to apologise for motions that weren&#39;t her own. Typically, Tifa 
took this time to stand on Cloud&#39;s foot if he so much as tried to worm 
his way closer and casually laid her arm behind Aerith&#39;s shoulders in a 
&#39;she&#39;s mine&#39; motion.

Aerith wasn&#39;t entirely dense when it came to matters of the heart, she 
knew that something was happening between Tifa and Cloud, leaving her 
stuck in the middle of it all, wondering if it was safe for her to even 
go to the bathroom unsupervised. Scratch that; they&#39;d both insist on 
being watched the entire time she was away. It was starting to feel 
somewhat like being a prisoner of war, only she wasn&#39;t sure what the war 
was about, what started it or how the war would end.

So on the third day, she escaped them both to sit between Cait and 
Barrett in the front, when the canyon desert faded and grass suddenly 
started. It was a pale, dry affair to begin with, the grass looking as 
though it struggled to live every second, but soon the lush green she 
mentally associated with the rolling countryside opened up. The grass 
was thick, deep and dotted with rapeseed grass, dandelions and 
wildflowers. She put her hands on the dash of the buggy in excitement.

&quot;Wow, look, how pretty even if it&#39;s so late in the year!&quot;

Everyone moved to see through a window, the cries of Yuffie from behind 
as Red got in her way and the subsequent growling match between them for 
a view. Tifa and Cloud remained silent, until Tifa said in her quietest 
voice that chilled Aerith&#39;s heart, &quot;Yeah, Nibelheim always was pretty 
this time of year.&quot;

&quot;Nibelheim, getting close to your hometown, eh? Y&#39;sure Sephiroth&#39;s gonna 
be there?&quot; Barrett called from the front. She twisted to try and see the 
faces of both residents of the destroyed, haunted town; marginally 
surprised to see almost mirror replica expressions on both their faces, 
Tifa looking out of the window to the distant mountains and Cloud 
bending his head so his hair seemed grimy, not as brightly blond as 
usual.

&quot;He&#39;s there.&quot;

&quot;Awright... getting kind of dark, we ain&#39;t making that town today, 
whatever is left of it, that is. Best we all jes&#39; camp down fer the 
night. Red, yo, get out and lope alongside, will yeh? Makes finding 
somewhere to sleep better, y&#39;know?&quot;

&quot;Do I look like a pet?&quot; the red furred creature growled.

&quot;No, but you look like you know the area better than us. Get out, go 
on!&quot;

Red snarled but did get out, after putting a paw heavily on Yuffie&#39;s 
hand. She muffled a gasp and clutched her hand close to her chest with a 
whimper, &quot;Like, ow? Clumsy...&quot;

&quot;Not clumsy,&quot; he panted through the open window, voice carrying easily 
in the descending twilight, &quot;I did it on purpose.&quot;

&quot;Why you sneaky little-&quot; she fumed, but Barrett was laughing and soon 
even the others relaxed their dark moods, to enjoy the merriment of the 
moment. Aerith slumped down a little, relieved that the tension in the 
buggy had gone down.

Yuffie sat back too, folding her arms and pouting viciously, &quot;Fine, 
laugh then, when I vomit down your neck it won&#39;t be so funny.&quot;

&quot;Jeez, take a joke!&quot; Cait chirped.

&quot;Oh shut up.&quot;

&quot;Hey.&quot; She said, pointing at where Red had finally loped to a 
standstill, and then to the mountain range, &quot;That&#39;s really impressive. 
Stop the car, I think we found somewhere to camp out.&quot; She twitched at 
her necklace, looking from the corner of her eye, past her heavy golden 
brown bangs to where Tifa and Cloud were both staring at the mountains. 
The buggy thrummed to a halt and slowly everyone clambered out by the 
small grove of trees, apart from Yuffie who took this opportune moment 
to sink to the floor, trying to gulp in air to calm her travel sickness.

Aerith tilted her head to get a better look at the mountains, and then 
was joined by the others. She shaded her eyes with a hand held to her 
forehead, feeling small and somewhat in awe looking up at the expanse of 
majestic rock. It was dark purple already, by the evening, it would be 
darker still, and the peaks dotted white they reached that high up. 
&quot;Wow,&quot; she said.

&quot;Everyone says that,&quot; Cloud murmured sadly, &quot;People used to come from 
miles around to stand on the highest peak in the world, the tallest 
mountain. Now, it&#39;s nothing, there&#39;s nothing left.&quot;

&quot;Nothing at all?&quot; Aerith queried, looking across to Tifa, then back to 
Cloud. Both wore grim masks of determination. &quot;Not even the pathways, 
bridges?&quot;

&quot;Probably not.&quot;

&quot;But,&quot; Tifa chimed in, &quot;I&#39;ll find us a way. I grew up spelunking, so 
this should pose no problem to me. But we should think about setting up 
camp. Could you get us the water today, Aerith?&quot;

A little surprised, as normally she was the one to set up the fire and 
cooking, the ancient nodded and followed them towards the buggy, picking 
out the canister and moving away, to the trickle of a stream that 
splashed and hissed close by. All the while, the oppressive mountains 
loomed over her, and she couldn&#39;t help but think of the faceless terror 
that had been ShinRa...

------------------------------------

The corridors were flung in all directions, tilted badly and confusing, 
like a maze for a lab rat that she fled down, running her fingers along 
the walls, looking for the memories embedded in the soft crumbling 
plaster and the dirt streak paint, the peeling wallpaper that was no 
longer fashionable. The rooms contained beds and bracken and broken 
equipment that half glowed with memories of power and memories of evil 
things.

She came to the staircase that spiralled down, but with courage in her 
every step, she soldiered down them, feeling fingers touching the walls 
still of this singular world; the cobbles and the mortar crumbling under 
her fingertips as she passed.

The screams were coming from the bottom.

Soon she alighted, soft like a feather, into the darkness and stared 
down the hallway to the door at the far end. Swallowing, she clasped her 
necklace and moved in closer to the doorway, where the jamb rattled and 
the knob shook, feverishly. Trying hard to keep her wits, she grasped 
the handle and turned it clockwise, opening the door.

Inside was a library mixed closely with that of a laboratory and she 
entered, step by step, careful not to disturb the dust, heading in 
curiosity for the glowing green tanks where two people hung suspended in 
the watery substance. Each work a face mask, designed to feed them 
oxygen no doubt, both figures were male and very naked, but she paid 
that no attention, leaning in closer instead to the tank to try and read 
the words scratched there.

F...r...e...e...

Free?

She turned away to leave and explore the library, but a hand shot out 
from behind her and dragged her round; nothing could quell the scream 
rising in her throat as Zack, her poor beloved, missing Zack stared 
sightlessly at her with completely white eyes, naked and dripping with 
the green water, his dark hair plastered down his neck and shoulders.

&quot;Aerith, free me,&quot; he gurgled and pushed her as she flailed and 
screamed, trying to hold onto him, trying to stay upright, or perhaps 
trying to escape. She waited for the dull thud of her fragile body 
hitting the floorboards, but there was a splash and then she was 
sinking, into water, into cool blue water where her hair misted up in 
strands above her, her clothes, her arms leaden and lifeless.

She sank, or floated; she was not sure which, but her scream was 
soundless and the tears in her eyes vanishing with each blink of her 
eyes in the painful, sweet water.

&quot;Forgive me,&quot; she mouthed as there was less light, bit by bit, 
until...nothing...

----------------------------------

She came awake with a start, surprised to see that Tifa was half 
crouched over her in the darkness, both their sleeping bags close by one 
another. Her face flamed as she realised Tifa wasn&#39;t exactly going to 
win any awards for wearing a lot to bed, but then, she didn&#39;t 
particularly pile the clothes on earlier. Her hand came up shakily to 
rub her throat, a small laugh eking out.

&quot;You were screaming,&quot; Tifa said in her quiet voice, calm voice; the 
voice Aerith had grown not only accustomed to, but the voice of reason 
in all the madness. Her hand helped stroke down some of Aerith&#39;s hair, 
mussed from the thrashing she&#39;d done when asleep, &quot;Was it a bad dream.&quot;

&quot;Just a weird dream. Tifa, is there a mansion with a staircase inside 
it, in Nibelheim?&quot;

&quot;...We have a mansion, what kind of stairs?&quot;

&quot;Spiralling, downwards.&quot;

&quot;No, nothing like that, sorry. Why, was it in your dream?&quot;

Aerith knuckled at her eyes, &quot;Yes, it was. There was a library and there 
was...&quot;

Zack. Begging me to help him...

&quot;...there was...&quot;

Water. Always that water... what does it mean?

&quot;...Zack.&quot; Her voice broke and she started crying, suddenly Tifa was 
drawing her in close and she sobbed onto the girls shoulder, feeling all 
broken up for things beyond her control. &quot;The dreams have never been 
this awful, Teef,&quot; she confessed.

&quot;Dreams? Do you have them often?&quot;

&quot;Sometimes... I dream of water. Always water,&quot; she gave a little laugh 
through the storm of tears, &quot;You&#39;d think it&#39;d make some sense if I was 
even a touch hydrophobic, but I&#39;m not, not in the slightest. I like 
swimming. But this water, it&#39;s different, it&#39;s choking me.&quot;

The fighter frowned, a slight furrow appearing between otherwise 
perfectly tended eyebrows; reminded Aerith in one of those weird 
roundabout ways, that she should do some primping at some point; &quot;How 
long have you been having those dreams? The ones with water.&quot;

Be truthful.

&quot;Ever since I saw my mother die, my real mother. I... keep wondering if 
the Planet is trying to tell me something that&#39;s too painful for it to 
simply tell me with words.&quot;

&quot;Have you spoken, with the Planet, recently?&quot;

She stared down at Tifa&#39;s collarbone, head nestled on her shoulder. &quot;A 
little. It sometimes tells me about Sephiroth, sometimes tells me that I 
have to do certain things... sometimes, recently, it&#39;s been asking me if 
I&#39;m ready.&quot; Aerith squeezed her eyes shut, the pain of the force behind 
the motion felt good, bizarrely, &quot;I don&#39;t know what it means. I must 
sound so completely crazy to you.&quot;

&quot;No, not crazy, just different.&quot;

&quot;Haha, different... I like that.&quot;

&quot;So do I,&quot; the taller girl breathed sadly, then continued as Aerith 
tried to ponder on what that curious little phrase tried to convey. &quot;You 
know, Cloud is in love with you.&quot;

She betrayed herself by blushing heatedly, the broken little chuckle 
from Tifa confirming that she had noticed the sudden change in 
temperature against her shoulder. Aerith clutched her hands together, 
wondering what she should say to something like that, or if she should 
even try saying anything at all. It didn&#39;t seem to be the right time for 
anything to be said by her, not yet. &quot;I...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; murmured Tifa, &quot;I know. But... did you also know...&quot;

I can hear her heart pounding, thud, thud, thud - I&#39;m amazed it hasn&#39;t 
broken her ribs.

&quot;I mean,&quot; the other swallowed her words, trying to fumble something out; 
&quot;I&#39;m not so good, with myself. I feel sometimes... that... I&#39;m someone 
else inside, or more precisely, everything I want to be, I&#39;m not right 
now, because I don&#39;t know how to say it quite right. But if it&#39;s you, I 
don&#39;t mind messing my words up, because, you know, you&#39;re you... so I 
wanted to, that is, I... you see...&quot;

&quot;Tifa?&quot;

&quot;...tell you, that... I ... I...&quot; She gave a kind of infuriated half 
sob, likely with herself, and forced out, &quot;I love you.&quot;

&quot;...Oh...&quot; was the limit of Aerith&#39;s vocabulary right now. She wouldn&#39;t 
have found the will to say much else; it was a surprise but, not as much 
of a surprise as it should have been. Thinking back, there were those 
strange sensations in the pit of her stomach whenever she had been close 
by either Tifa or Cloud, only she&#39;d overlooked it as a destiny thing, 
Planet calling her to a change in scenery. Not that it would...

Love.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to say anything,&quot; Tifa stumbled right on, stuttering 
like a madwoman, &quot;I mean, it&#39;s a bit confusing, I suppose, well, it is, 
no suppose about it. Just... Just look at me, and see me, Aerith. Look 
at what you&#39;ve done to me... I never thought I&#39;d be happy again, really 
happy. The kind where you wake up and you smile and it&#39;s not a faked 
smile. That kind of happy. Because, I wake up next to you, because I 
spend the day with you, because you&#39;ve filled a gap I didn&#39;t know I had. 
You&#39;re... something to me. You know? ...and... All my life, I wanted to 
be a &#145;someone&#146;... to a &#145;somebody&#146;. And...&quot;

Aerith felt her hand being held, an arm tightening about her fragile 
shoulders as Tifa struggled with something she&#39;d spent the last few 
months fighting, hiding so hard; feelings and thoughts that Aerith knew 
she returned at least, for every moment, she looked for Tifa, she 
expected there to be Tifa.

&quot;...and... I want that... somebody to be you, Aerith. I want to be a 
&#145;someone&#146;, for you. So look upon me... kindly... please, even if you can 
never return my affection.&quot; There was a crack in Tifa&#39;s voice at the 
end, wavering uncertainty, and bitterness and jaded hope all mingled in 
together, &quot;So... I&#39;ll take what I can of you, Rissy.&quot;

&quot;Teef,&quot; she mumbled, unable to think clearly right now.

&quot;I... I know, that is, t-that Cloud loves you,&quot; was she starting to cry? 
&quot;And... you at least have some affection for him, but please... don&#39;t 
leave me out of your beautiful life... please...&quot; Then Tifa was crying 
and Aerith found she was lost for words.

So instead, she moved closer, her free arm sliding about Tifa to clutch 
the shaking body close. She shook her hand free and lifted it, brushing 
away tears almost as quickly as they came, &quot;Tifa... I don&#39;t know what to 
think.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I had to, I just had to, or I&#39;d die... I would have... I...&quot;

&quot;Shh,&quot; she admonished her and leant in close enough to brush her lips on 
Tifa&#39;s, the faintest pressure of skin; how cold Aerith was in comparison 
to the other girl, still laced with the aftershock of her vivid dreams, 
but was vaguely pleased when Tifa pressed back just as lightly into the 
kiss.

The crying slowed as the taller girl said in tones of wonder, &quot;Aerith?&quot;

&quot;Shh,&quot; she breathed for the second time that night.

--------------------------------------

The tent was dark as pitch still, morning hours away but she found she 
couldn&#39;t close her eyes.

She didn&#39;t move, for that would dislodge the sleeping head tucked into 
her shoulder, the arm thrown across her middle and curled up her side. 
They slept in their seperate bags still, for after a storm of weeping; 
the Ancient had lain her down and kissed all that sorrow and pain away. 
She&#39;d never realised it was like this, to be really in love. The agony 
of childhood, fleeting romance faded fast in the sudden storm of her 
realisation that she loved deeply. That it was a woman, it didn&#39;t 
matter, the loving mattered. That someone, her someone! Had accepted her 
whole heartedly, that was what mattered to her.

Outside, nightingales warbled softly in the copse canopy and she smiled, 
tilting her head back with a sigh.

Aerith hadn&#39;t said she loved her.

But in her heart, she knew she would when she was ready to.

...and Tifa was happy enough to wait for that.</pre>
