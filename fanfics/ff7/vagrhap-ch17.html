<h1>Vagrants Rhapsody (part 17 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/pnkpanther9.html">PnkPanther9</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff7/vagrhap-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>Tifa&#39;s eyes eased open with a slow reluctance, as if fearing the 
sunlight would lance through them and burn the timid soul inside. When 
no such thing happened, her eyes opened wide, the pupils adjusting to 
the dimly lit hotel room.

Her caution came not from a mind slow with sleep, but rather, a restless 
mind. A mind so charged, that even as the whole body shut down, it still 
insisted on running circles.

Stiffly, Tifa remained still on the bed, her gaze burning into the 
crimson wall across from her. One hand clutched the bed sheets to her 
chin in a fierce grip. The woman took shallow breaths as her eyes rolled 
about in their sockets; she tried to survey as much as she could without 
moving her head. The fighter strained her ears, trying to listen, trying 
to see if she could pick out the sound of her friend&#39;s steady breathing, 
or the sounds of someone moving about in the bathroom. When she heard 
none, she sat up, rigid, her eyes wide and her hair mussed on one side.

Still clutching the blankets up to her chin, Tifa saw that the bed next 
to hers was empty.

At this, she let out an audible sigh, strings of tension cutting away so 
that her body slumped forward, limp. Tifa covered her face with her 
hands, both of which shook from exhaustion. Sleep had not come easy last 
night. Recalling the last time she looked at the clock, the woman would 
have guessed that she only managed to fall asleep around five in the 
morning. Lifting her head, Tifa looked at the clock again.

It was seven-thirty.

Tifa groaned.

Last night had to be the most awkward time of the woman&#39;s life. Just 
thinking of it made the woman&#39;s stomach clench.

Tifa had stood and waited for Yuffie at the parking lot. She didn&#39;t know 
how long she stood there. It could have been seconds. It could have been 
minutes. To her, it seemed hours. Tifa expected Yuffie to be demanding 
an explanation the moment she came up from the beach. She expected her 
to huff and puff, and rant and fuss. The woman wouldn&#39;t have even been 
surprised if the girl had been sad or put-out...

...But no.

She was just blank. Perfectly stoic, and if anything, perhaps even 
nonchalant.

Tifa was flabbergasted.

The woman couldn&#39;t wrap her head around it. She couldn&#39;t understand how 
the girl, THIS girl, a girl cut from such a rough and garish cloth, had 
managed to walk back up the sandy hill so easily, her face practically a 
porcelain mask in the moonlight.

Not a word was said on the ride back to the hotel. The entire time, Tifa 
tried leaning back, away from Yuffie, not feeling comfortable to hold 
onto the girl so tightly as she had done before. But even so, the girl 
did not seem tense, nor did she say anything regarding Tifa&#39;s obvious 
reluctance during the course of the ride.

Back at the Oceanside Inn, Tifa retired quickly, wanting nothing more 
than to forget everything that had happened...or nearly happened. But 
Yuffie didn&#39;t go to bed so quickly. She went to the roof, to enjoy the 
night view, but not before saying good night to Tifa.

The woman was surprised the girl spoke, and almost didn&#39;t return the 
gesture. She couldn&#39;t pick out anything different about the girl&#39;s voice 
when she had said that. There was no hostility, but then again, no clear 
sign of good nature. A simple good night. That was all.

Alone in the room, Tifa lay in her bed, purposefully turning her back to 
the door so that she wouldn&#39;t have to see Yuffie when she returned. She 
didn&#39;t move for the rest of night, a feat that caused a stiffness in her 
neck and discomfort in her back. But she didn&#39;t care. It wasn&#39;t until 
much later that exhaustion finally pried Tifa from her thoughts of 
self-loathing...

Now the fighter sat in her bed, dejected and depressed, dreading the 
moment Yuffie returned from whatever it was she was doing. Reaching her 
right hand up, the woman tried to run her fingers through her hair, only 
to find a terrible knot halting their course. The fighter sighed. There 
was no telling how long it was going to take working that one out with 
her brush. And her limbs felt so tired, too.

&quot;Do I really have to move? Can&#39;t I just stay in bed today?&quot; Tifa 
thought, her inner voice taking on a whiny tone.

Another voice answered her, this one sounding scornful. &quot;Of course, you 
moron. Do you really think you can just be lazy and lounge about? If you 
had meant to do that, then you would&#39;ve stayed home!&quot;

At this argument, the woman rolled her eyes and placed her feet on the 
floor. &quot;Well for four hundred gil a night, I&#39;d think we&#39;d be a little 
entitled to enjoy what this hotel has to offer.&quot; Tifa grumbled as she 
stood.

Shuffling to the bathroom, the fighter got the sense of a weight 
pressing down on her. This had to be the most tired she ever felt since 
Meteor. Turning on the bathroom light, Tifa squinted her eyes and leaned 
forward onto the counter.

She didn&#39;t like what she saw.

Dark bags hung beneath the woman&#39;s eyes, her complexion a sickly shade. 
On her left side, her hair hung limp and stringy, meanwhile, the other 
side tangled and twisted ferociously, as if the strands were somehow 
trying to attack her head. The woman pondered this thought, her head 
tilting to the side slightly as she regarded the mess in the mirror&#39;s 
reflection. Absently, Tifa reached for the brush sitting on the far end 
of the counter.

&quot;Wow. You look like crap.&quot;

Tifa jumped, her body swinging around and stepping away from the door in 
one sweeping motion as she turned to see the person behind her. Her hand 
knocked the brush off the counter as she did this, and there was a loud 
&#39;plunk&#39; sound that caused the fighter to freeze in horror.

Yuffie, who was leaning on the door frame, gave Tifa a soft grin. 
&quot;Y&#39;know, you just knocked your hairbrush into the toilet?&quot;

Tifa closed her eyes, her tongue finding place in her cheek.

The younger girl shook her head. &quot;You&#39;re so incredibly unaware 
sometimes, y&#39;know? I would&#39;ve thought you&#39;d have gotten your senses 
back, what with my always sneaking up on you...but nope, you&#39;re just as 
rusty as when I first met up with you at that teeny town of yours.&quot; The 
girl&#39;s grin widened some. &quot;I guess that explains some stuff...&quot;

Tifa opened her eyes a fraction, giving the girl before her a weary 
stare.

She didn&#39;t want to think of what Yuffie alluded to.

Yuffie shrugged. &quot;You could wash it you know. Course...that&#39;d still be 
kinda gross.&quot;

Tifa turned and looked down at the toilet, a grimace on her face. It 
wasn&#39;t as if she hadn&#39;t had to fish belongings out of a toilet before. 
But never had those objects been essentials in keeping up her appearance 
and hygiene.

And never had she had to fish out an item in front of a smart-mouthed 
ninja, either.

Sighing, the woman rolled up her sleeve. Oh well. It wasn&#39;t as if she 
expected this day to be a good one anyhow.

Reaching down, Tifa grit her teeth as her hand plunged into the cold 
toilet-water. Her brush, a red-handled one, with dark bristles, was 
resting in the outlet, the head pointing downward. Grabbing the brush 
gingerly by the handle with her thumb and index finger, Tifa quickly 
lifted the brush out of the bowl. Arm extended all the way out, the 
woman dropped the brush in the sink, where it clattered against the 
marble.

Yuffie raised an eyebrow. &quot;So you&#39;re really going to brush your hair 
with that?&quot;

Tifa turned and gave the girl a look over her shoulder and the ninja 
held up her hands and turned away, a bemused smile on her face.

Lips a thin line, Tifa washed her hands in the sink, the hot water 
scalding. She scrubbed furiously as if trying to peel off her own skin. 
Inwardly, she knew, she was just avoiding speaking to Yuffie.

A minute or two went by. The woman sighed yet again as she shut off the 
water. One could only stall that way for so long.

Drying her hands, the woman rubbed the hand towel over her skin slowly, 
her gaze carefully lifting. In the mirror, Tifa could see Yuffie rifling 
through her duffel bag at the end of her bed behind her. The girl seemed 
completely at ease. Tifa scowled.

Where did someone get that kind of security, anyhow?

Dropping the towel on the counter, Tifa growled and covered her face 
with both hands. After a moment, she spread her fingers, eyes peeping 
between them, and looked down at her brush, which sat still in the sink, 
bristles pointed toward her as if in calling.

The woman lowered her hands and made a face. Yuffie was right. She had 
no desire to brush her hair with a brush recently dropped in the 
toilet...at least, not until it were thoroughly cleaned. And for Tifa, 
that meant an overnight soaking in a powerful disinfectant. She didn&#39;t 
have that time. Granted, she hadn&#39;t the slightest idea what she was 
doing that day.

&quot;Hey, Rusty.&quot;

Tifa turned. Yuffie was holding up a comb. &quot;I&#39;ve got this comb you can 
use, if you want. I know it might take longer to work through your hair 
with this, but at least its something.&quot;

For a moment, the woman said nothing.

Than she smiled a small smile and nodded. &quot;Yeah, that&#39;ll work fine, 
Yuffie.&quot;

Stepping out of the bathroom, Tifa reached out a hand for the comb, but 
the girl drew it back, a sheepish grin appearing on her face.

&quot;I was thinking,&quot; Yuffie said as Tifa gazed at her in confusion. &quot;I was 
jes&#39; thinking...y&#39;know, since your tired, that I could...&quot; The ninja 
made a flippant motion with the comb, &quot;Brush your hair, maybe?&quot;

Tifa stared at her, her trepidation evident in her face.

Yuffie clasped the comb to her chest with both hands, her eyes turning 
pleading, &quot;Please, Tifa?&quot;

&quot;Yuffie...&quot; Tifa pointed at her head. &quot;Have you seen my head?&quot;

The ninja raised an eyebrow. &quot;Is it possible to miss it?&quot;

The woman shook her head, a small frown appearing on her face. &quot;No way 
Yuffie.&quot; she had no patience for this game. The fighter reached for the 
comb. &quot;Just gimme the comb-&quot;

Yuffie danced back, hiding the comb behind her back as she did so. 
&quot;You&#39;ve gotta let me comb your hair! I wanna be able to brag to people 
that I actually got to comb your hair!&quot;

Tifa&#39;s frown grew deeper. &quot;Can&#39;t you just give me the comb?&quot;

The ninja made a thoughtful face and tapped her chin. After a split 
second, she shook her head. &quot;Nope.&quot; the girl said pleasantly.

The older woman grit her teeth. &quot;Yuffie, in case you hadn&#39;t noticed, I&#39;m 
not really in the mood for this. Now are you gonna let me use the comb 
or not?&quot;

For a moment, Yuffie gazed at her. Then, without warning, she held out 
the comb.

Tifa blinked, surprised. She hadn&#39;t really expected the girl to yield 
like that.

&quot;Here.&quot; the girl said, a smirk now on her face.

Suddenly suspicious, Tifa didn&#39;t move. Yuffie placed a hand on her hip 
and gave her a scornful look. &quot;Hey! After all that stubborn demanding, 
you&#39;re not gonna take it?&quot;

The woman said nothing, only gazed at Yuffie with narrowed eyes. Then 
she snatched the comb from the girl&#39;s hands. &quot;Thank you.&quot; Tifa said 
stiffly, still gazing at Yuffie with suspicious eyes. The girl shrugged 
and turned, walking out to the balcony.

Tifa watched her go, and didn&#39;t move until she was outside, the sliding 
glass door shut behind her. With her leave, the fighter allowed her body 
to relax. She didn&#39;t realize she had become so tense again. Gazing down 
at the comb in her hands, the woman took a second before sitting down at 
her bed and pulling her hair over her right shoulder.

The woman gazed down at the knotted mess and decided it best to start at 
the bottom, and then carefully work her way up. Lifting the comb she 
began to run it through her hair, working at the strands gingerly, 
pausing at times to feel where she could try and work a knot out. But 
the minutes ticked by, and her arms began to get tired. Growing 
impatient, the woman began to pull more viciously, caring less and less 
of where she placed the comb, so long as it ran through. This caused 
pain to blossom over her scalp as she forced the comb downward, and her 
eyes teared from the pain. Tifa could literally hear the strands 
snapping, and with each painful stroke, her arms grew weaker and weaker.

Finally, the woman stopped, her arms falling into her lap, drained of 
all strength.

Out of the corner of her eye, Tifa could see Yuffie standing at the foot 
of her bed, her arms crossed and her head tilted to one side. Without 
even looking at her face, the fighter knew the girl was still wearing 
that infuriating smirk.

Rolling her eyes, Tifa held the comb up in the air, and wordlessly, 
Yuffie took it.

The fighter turned her body around so that she faced the bed&#39;s 
headboard, the mattress sinking some as Yuffie sat behind her. Tifa took 
in a deep breath and stared down at her bed&#39;s rumpled sheets as the 
ninja began to comb her hair.

The two sat silent, and the fighter found herself marveling at the 
silence.

She marveled because there was nothing, &#39;silent&#39;, about it.

It was charged with things unsaid, things Tifa felt and understood even 
with the lack of sound, the lack of sight. Her senses picked up on it, 
keen to its language. How many times had Tifa found herself in this 
position? How many times had she suffered this sort of thick cloud of 
words and wants, quiet, yet clear just the same?

So many times...

And yet with each gentle stroke, Tifa could feel her heart beat quicken. 
Her cheeks flushed as Yuffie quietly worked behind her, silent, and 
calm...and extremely silent. She worked through Tifa&#39;s knotted hair 
patiently and carefully.

The woman knew the words being said here. She was a master of things 
unsaid, after all. The only thing she seemed to lack was the awareness 
Yuffie mentioned. How many other times had the girl communicated 
something that Tifa hadn&#39;t picked up on? It was those times that Tifa&#39;s 
understanding of the silent language, the Unspoken language, went to 
nothing.

After all, what good was something said, if the person it was said to 
wasn&#39;t listening?

But Tifa listened now.

And she clearly understood what Yuffie was saying.

The girl&#39;s hand carefully held the woman&#39;s hair.

I know your scared.

Gently, she pulled at a knot, working at it&#39;s heart, so that it 
unraveled without resistance.

As complicated as it may seem, it&#39;s really all so simple.

Pulling the comb down slowly, Yuffie let the teeth run through the 
length of Tifa&#39;s hair, down to the ends.

I can be gentle. And I can be patient, too, believe it or not.

Yuffie worked at another knot, a bigger one this time. Tifa could feel 
the girl tug slightly to work it out, but it didn&#39;t hurt. The hands Tifa 
had been clenching relaxed slightly. A warmth blossomed in the woman&#39;s 
chest, and her eyes spaced some as her mind became hypnotized with 
Yuffie&#39;s silent, but elegant talk.

I&#39;m not afraid. I&#39;m not afraid at all...and you shouldn&#39;t be either.

Tifa closed her eyes and allowed a sigh to escape her lips. She didn&#39;t 
know how long they sat together there, but soon the woman could feel the 
comb go through her hair without any resistance at all.

Just you wait and see. It will work out. It will all work out.

The older woman opened her eyes a portion, her breathing deep and 
relaxed. Yuffie spoke softly behind her, and Tifa blinked at the sound 
of her voice, her gaze coming back into focus.

&quot;You mind if I braid your hair?&quot; the girl asked quietly, her voice a 
deep tone that made Tifa swallow nervously.

Mutely, Tifa shook her head.

At this affirmation, the ninja reached up and ran her fingers through 
Tifa&#39;s hair carefully, taking measured portions to begin her braiding. 
The woman shivered at the small sigh Yuffie let out as she began to 
weave the strands in a steady rhythm of loving admiration. The ninja 
worked against the woman&#39;s back, and Tifa could feel every deft movement 
the girl made, a hypnotic dance of the fingers that made the fighter 
close her eyes and swallow hard again.

But then, quite suddenly, the contact was gone.

Startled, Tifa opened her eyes and looked back, over her shoulder. 
Yuffie had sat back and was now holding up the end of the finished 
braid. A catty grin on her face, the girl said evenly, &quot;Hold this for a 
second.&quot;

Blinking, the woman did as the girl told, holding the end of the braid 
as Yuffie stood and walked over to her duffel bag. Zipping open one of 
the compartments, the ninja procured a small hair-band, and tossing it 
to Tifa, she asked pleasantly, &quot;So...wanna get some breakfast?&quot;

Tifa, catching the hair-band clumsily, stared at her friend with a 
bemused expression.

&quot;Um...yeah,&quot; The woman fumbled as she tied the band around the end of 
her braid. &quot;That...that sounds...um...&quot; She bit her lip and looked up, 
allowing the finished braid to fall against her chest. Red faced, Tifa 
nodded her head. &quot;Sounds good.&quot;

----------

&quot;You just can&#39;t beat pancakes, Tif. You just can&#39;t beat &#39;em. You can 
travel the world, trying all the different breakfast dishes the cultures 
have to offer, but pancakes will always be on top. And you wanna know 
why? Because their rich. Because their sweet. It&#39;s like a kick in the 
mouth, y&#39;know? Bam! It wakes you up! Probably better than coffee does. I 
mean, look at it! The oozing syrup, the rich, creamy butter. And it&#39;s so 
versatile! If I wanted, I could have this with strawberries! 
Blueberries! Whip cream, powdered sugar, chocolate, and all kinds of 
different flavored syrup! I&#39;m tellin&#39; ya, pancakes are the best. You 
just can&#39;t beat &#39;em. You just can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never heard someone talk so passionately about pancakes before.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well that&#39;s me. Passionate and fiery. For me, it&#39;s all or 
nothing. I don&#39;t get why people half-ass things anyhow. If you&#39;re gonna 
love it, love it. You know?&quot;

Tifa didn&#39;t say anything. She only shook her head and sipped at her 
coffee, a rich blend that went down her throat in a cascade of warmth 
that made her sigh in satisfaction.

&quot;Georgia&#39;s&quot; was a small restaurant, two blocks down from the Oceanside 
Inn. Yuffie had peeped in during her early morning walk, and was eager 
to check it out, &quot;Because,&quot; she said, &quot;It&#39;s got food I can actual 
pronounce!&quot;

And Tifa found no reason to regret coming to the restaurant. Her waffles 
tasted delicious, and the coffee was good. The woman took another sip of 
her drink.

...The coffee was really good.

Yuffie stared out the windows, a thoughtful expression on her face as 
she chewed her food. Swallowing, she said lightly. &quot;It&#39;s a nice day 
today, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Tifa nodded absently.

&quot;Maybe we can just take it easy today. I dunno. Go sunbathing or 
something down at the beach.&quot; the girl suggested.

Tifa looked up at her friend. Yuffie turned her eyes on her and grinned 
slightly. &quot;It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve made a sand castle.&quot; she said.

&quot;Sand castles...&quot; the fighter smiled. &quot;I used to make sand castles when 
me and my dad would go camping down at the beaches near Nibelheim. I&#39;d 
use everything from sticks, to shells, to star fish. I got pretty good 
at it.&quot;

Yuffie pushed her empty plate aside and leaned forward on her elbows. 
&quot;Did&#39;ja use a bucket and shovel?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Those little plastic ones.&quot;

The ninja smirked. &quot;I never used &#39;em. I never needed to. I became such a 
master at making sand castles all I ever needed were my hands.&quot;

Tifa raised an eyebrow at this boast. &quot;Oh really? And can you still do 
that?&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s smirk grew larger. &quot;Bet you ten gil I can.&quot;

Tifa returned her expression. She was easily getting caught up in her 
friend&#39;s good humor, forgetting herself in the midst of their exchange. 
Her earlier reticence slipping away, the fighter extended a hand. &quot;Shake 
on it, then.&quot; she challenged, her eyes brightening.

The ninja took her hand firmly and shook it. &quot;I&#39;m tellin&#39; ya, Rusty. I&#39;m 
a master.&quot;

The fighter shook her head, a grin on her face as she stood to her feet. 
Paying for their food at the register, the two left the restaurant. Tifa 
began to walk back toward the Inn, but Yuffie placed a hand on her arm 
to stop her. &quot;Hey, where are you going?&quot; she asked.

Tifa looked back at her, confused. &quot;Aren&#39;t we going to the beach? I 
wanna change out of this outfit!&quot;

Yuffie frowned. &quot;And into what? Did you bring anything to wear at the 
beach?&quot;

The woman thought for a moment, then sheepishly, she shook her head.

The ninja raised her hands. &quot;Then?&quot;

&quot;Okay, so what do you propose?&quot;

&quot;A quick stop at a clothing store. THEN we&#39;ll go to the beach.&quot;

&quot;Do you know where to go?&quot;

&quot;I saw a place near Serino&#39;s that might have some nice stuff. We can go 
and change right there, and then just walk to the beach.&quot;

Tifa nodded. Pointing over her shoulder, she said, &quot;Okay, but we&#39;ve 
still gotta head back to the Inn. I don&#39;t plan on walking all the way to 
the beach, y&#39;know.&quot;

So the two returned to the hotel, where Yuffie&#39;s bike was parked along 
the curb. Yuffie sat first, as usual, strapping on her helmet. Tifa 
hesitated a moment before sitting behind her and doing the same.

On the way to the store, the fighter pondered carefully her situation. 
It was clear things were somehow different now between her and Yuffie, 
but it didn&#39;t seem as frightening as Tifa would&#39;ve imagined. The 
amiability still remained, as well as the good humor. But there was now 
a sense of always being on the verge of revealing more. Their jokes, she 
could see, were taking on a personal and intimate note. Was it...dare 
Tifa say it...flirting?

The woman looked around her as they sped along, eyes watching the myriad 
of bright sunny faces flashing by like bursts of flame. She wondered how 
these people&#39;s lives threaded together, how they went about love and the 
game of life. Did they find it as confusing as she did? Did they care at 
all about the things she did? Did their lives thread into hers? One big 
network of successes and failures, expectations and disappointments, 
just like a symphony. When did the song end? Did it stop at her? Or was 
she the beginning? Was she a note lost in the melody, or was she the 
bridge that tied things together?

Tifa&#39;s arms unconsciously tightened around Yuffie&#39;s waist, and the woman 
buried her face in the girl&#39;s shoulder. The ninja was like an anchor 
that kept her from losing herself. For all the anxiety Tifa may have 
felt regarding her feelings for Yuffie, the woman unconsciously knew, 
deep down, that she drew more comfort from her friend than anything 
else.

Returning to the same streets as the night before, Yuffie found a free 
parking space a block away from Serino&#39;s. Taking off her helmet, Tifa 
asked, &quot;So where is this place, Yuffie?&quot;

Yuffie pointed up the street. &quot;It was just up here. I had to park down 
this way because there wasn&#39;t any place to stop up there. It isn&#39;t far 
though.&quot;

Together the two walked back up the street, Yuffie with her thumbs 
hooked into her jean pockets and Tifa with her arms crossed over her 
chest. The ninja stopped at the store on the street corner, her face 
lighting up. &quot;Here it is!&quot;

Tifa looked up at the sign. &quot;Aqua Blue&quot; It read.

Inside, the store was kept cool and was moderately spaced, the walls 
bare and the floor solid concrete, to give an industrial look. Displays 
were scattered about the store with mannequins dressed in casual, 
coastal clothing; shorts, bikinis, flip-flops, tank tops, skirts, 
t-shirts with surfer logo&#39;s, it all seemed so picturesque. Tifa lingered 
at the door way, her eyes flitting about somewhat nervously.

As young as she was, she still felt out of place in this modern setting.

Yuffie, who began walking toward the back of the store, looked back at 
her with a frown. &quot;Tifa?&quot;

Tifa looked at her and gave a quick, apologetic smile before hurrying 
forward. At the center of the store, a cashier&#39;s desk was set, and the 
employee looked up at them both and smiled. &quot;Good morning!&quot; she chirped, 
bouncing slightly with the greeting.

Tifa and Yuffie returned the gesture, moving past the register to the 
back of the store, where they saw swimsuits on a rack for half-off.

Yuffie&#39;s eyes lit up at the sight of it. &quot;Ooh! Jackpot!&quot; She exclaimed 
as she hurried forward.

Tifa, on the other hand, gazed warily at the rack. Half-off items tended 
to be the hideous ones no one would take at full price. Though, it 
wasn&#39;t unusual to find a deal hidden among sales racks, she wasn&#39;t sure 
she was in the mood for rifling through clothes at the moment.

Yuffie, already going through some of the swimsuits, pulled one up. &quot;Oh 
wow, this one&#39;s actually got ruffles!&quot; she giggled.

Tifa stood beside her and raised an eyebrow. The swimsuit, a two-piece, 
did indeed have ruffles, large, fluffy ruffles that sprouted around the 
waist and top. It didn&#39;t help that the colors were a light pink and 
pale, sea-green, with orange polka-dots. &quot;That&#39;s probably the ugliest 
swimsuit I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot; Tifa said.

Yuffie placed the swimsuit back onto the rack and pulled up another, 
this one a blue and white one-piece made to look like a sailor suit. It 
was complete with a wide collar and orange ascot.

The two girls blinked at it.

After a moment, Yuffie shook her head. &quot;This is beyond corny.&quot;

Tifa giggled and took the swimsuit away from the girl. Placing it back 
on the rack, the woman said, &quot;All right, that&#39;s enough! Let&#39;s look for 
something to wear so we can hurry up and get to the beach.&quot;

But Yuffie was giving Tifa an intent look, a mischievous smile coming 
over her features. Eye glinting, the girl picked the sailor swimsuit out 
again and held it up against Tifa. The fighter stared at her. &quot;Why don&#39;t 
you try it on?&quot; Yuffie asked, her head tilting to one side as she eyed 
the woman with her sharp eyes.

Tifa shook her head, a dubious look on her face. &quot;What? Are you kidding? 
This thing&#39;s ridiculous, I&#39;m not gonna try it on!&quot;

&quot;But its your size! And I&#39;d bet it&#39;d really highlight those curves of 
yours.&quot;

The fighter blushed at the mention of her &#39;curves&#39;. Still she pushed the 
swimsuit toward her friend. &quot;No.&quot; she said flatly.

Yuffie pouted. &quot;Aw, come on, Rusty! Please? Look if it&#39;ll make you feel 
better, I&#39;ll try on the other swimsuit! The one with the ruffles!&quot;

Tifa shook her head stubbornly, moving to the other side of the rack. &quot;I 
said, no.&quot;

Yuffie followed her closely. &quot;Oh please, there isn&#39;t anyone here to see 
us! We&#39;re the only ones in the store!&quot;

&quot;No, Yuffie! I won&#39;t wear that thing!&quot; Tifa began to search through the 
swimsuits, as if to say the matter was closed.

But Yuffie wouldn&#39;t quit. &quot;It&#39;ll be a riot! And it&#39;s not like we&#39;ll 
actually buy the stupid swimsuit. I just wanna see how it looks on you!&quot;

The woman sighed and rolled her eyes to the ceiling. &quot;For Ifrit&#39;s sake, 
I said NO, Yuffie!&quot;

Without warning, Tifa felt Yuffie hug her lightly around the waist. Head 
resting on the woman&#39;s shoulder, the ninja looked at her with wide, 
pleading eyes. &quot;Pleeease?&quot;

Tifa stared at her, her eyes widening and her face turning bright red. 
Throat tightening, the woman squeaked out, &quot;All right! All right, Shiva! 
I&#39;ll wear the stupid thing!&quot;

Letting the woman go, Yuffie smiled cheerfully. &quot;Great!&quot; Returning to 
the other side of the rack, she picked out the swimsuit with the 
ruffles. &quot;And I&#39;ll try this one on!&quot;

Tifa watched the girl skip by, a cheeky grin on her face as she entered 
one of the dressing booths at the back. Closing her eyes, the woman let 
out a heavy sigh and grabbed the sailor swimsuit.

Turning, she spied the store clerk staring at her from her place at the 
register. Jaw clenching, the woman glared back at her, and the young 
employee blushed and looked away hurriedly.

Satisfied, Tifa entered the dressing booth opposite of Yuffie&#39;s. Slowly, 
awkwardly, she began to remove her clothes, her eyes lifting shyly to 
look briefly in the mirror. A few years ago, she would&#39;ve felt 
completely comfortable wearing something as revealing as a bathing suit. 
But it had been a while since Tifa had worn one, and she was now 
beginning to feel a sense of insecurity as she sheepishly slipped the 
bathing suit on. Her body was not toned as it had once been, and she 
knew she had gained a bit of weight since her adventuring days; not 
enough to call herself overweight, but just enough to feel 
self-conscious of it.

Silently she wondered if there was any possibility that she could get 
out of wearing a bathing suit at all.

Looking in the mirror again, Tifa blinked at what she saw.

The bathing suit fit closely over her skin, and at the places where she 
expected the bathing suit to cut embarrassingly into her body, it 
smoothed perfectly. The neckline of the swimsuit cut down in a low &#39;V&#39; 
shape, revealing the valley between Tifa&#39;s breasts. The woman&#39;s face 
blushed furiously at this.

She looked like something straight out of a cheesy porn magazine.

&quot;Hey Tif?&quot;

The woman&#39;s heart stopped. Did she really dare go out in this thing?

Clearing her throat, the woman answered nervously. &quot;Um, yes, Yuffie?&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s voice carried over from her dressing booth. &quot;Did you get the 
swimsuit on, all right?&quot;

Tifa covered her mouth with one hand and closed her eyes.

A pause. &quot;Tifa?&quot;

The woman rubbed at her eye and groaned quietly. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she called, &quot;I 
got it on all right...I guess...&quot; the last bit, she added under her 
breath.

&quot;Great! Lemme&#39; see!&quot; Tifa could hear Yuffie&#39;s booth door squeak open. 
The fighter didn&#39;t move.

Another pause.

&quot;Uh...Rusty? Are you coming out?&quot;

Tifa considered the question for a moment. &quot;Um...&quot;

&quot;Rusty!&quot; Now Yuffie sounded annoyed. &quot;Get out here! If I have to be out 
in this stupid thing, so do you!&quot;

&quot;But I didn&#39;t want to do this to begin with!&quot; Tifa grumbled. Still, she 
turned, and with only a moment&#39;s hesitation, she opened the dressing 
booth door.

Yuffie stood before her, arms crossed high on her chest, and a scornful 
look on her face. The look fell away quickly, however, as Tifa emerged 
into full view, her shoulders hunched about her ears and her face a 
bright pink. &quot;Wow.&quot; the girl said, eyebrows raising almost to the 
hairline as she looked Tifa up and down.

The fighter wished she could disappear.

Covering her chest with her arms, the woman gave the ninja a dry look. 
&quot;Are you happy? Can I change now?&quot; Her eyes glanced back toward the 
store clerk, who was turned completely toward them now. A hand was 
clamped over her mouth, and the laughter could be seen clearly in her 
eyes as she shook silently with giggles. Tifa glared daggers at her, but 
the woman continued to stare, unabashed now.

Yuffie blinked out of her momentary trance and quickly shook her head. 
&quot;You haven&#39;t told me what you think of my swimsuit!&quot; The girl struck a 
sultry pose. &quot;So?&quot;

The woman turned her head and blinked at her. &quot;Uh...&quot; Tifa looked down 
at the girl&#39;s legs, long and smooth. The fighter could see the ninja&#39;s 
strength in her body, the muscles, though not obtrusive or bulging, were 
clear. Her modest chest and full rear weren&#39;t reduced by the gaudy 
swimsuit. If anything...

&quot;You look good.&quot; Tifa managed, trying not to stare inappropriately.

Yuffie glared at her. &quot;&#39;Good&#39;? That&#39;s it? I just look &#39;good&#39;?&quot;

Taken aback, the woman sputtered, &quot;Um, well-&quot;

The ninja shrugged and turned to the mirror set up between the dressing 
booths. &quot;Eh, with this silly thing, I guess &#39;good&#39; is all I can manage. 
I kinda like the ruffles, if you can believe it.&quot; At this, the girl 
hopped slightly, giggling as the ruffles rose and fell.

Tifa&#39;s face turned a dark shade as her eyes concentrated on something 
other than the ruffles.

Turning, the woman said stiffly, &quot;I&#39;m changing.&quot;

Yuffie stared after her, confused. &quot;What? What&#39;s the matter?&quot;

Looking back at the mirror, the girl turned to her side and looked at 
the swim suit.

&quot;Hmm...maybe she didn&#39;t like it after all?&quot;
The sky was going to fall on her.

Staring up long enough gave her this sensation...this feeling, as if the 
world was going to crash down on her. It was such a large and omnipotent 
thing, the sky. Tifa thought, that if she looked hard enough, she could 
literally see how the atmosphere bended...perhaps that explained the 
strange, and somewhat scary feeling.

The sky...it was going to fall on her.

Tifa laid upon a long beach towel purchased from Aqua Blue, her braided 
hair pulled over one shoulder. She should have been wearing sunglasses, 
she knew, but she wanted to see the sky as it was; bright, and smooth, 
and blue.

Small streaks of clouds spread across the sky like smears, distant from 
their larger, fluffier brethren hovering sparingly at the horizon. The 
sun&#39;s rays glared down angrily, causing Tifa to squint her eyes. She 
held up on arm to shield her face as she followed a flock of seagulls 
flying overhead. When they flew out of sight, she sighed, and sat up, 
pulling nervously at her top.

The swimsuit she had come to choose was a yellow bikini. She had been 
forced to go through several, each one she rejected giving a blow to her 
self-confidence. Among her reasons for rejection were things like, &quot;Too 
big. Too small. It cuts into the sides. This doesn&#39;t support my chest. I 
might as well be naked!&quot; and lastly, &quot;Is that supposed to slide in like 
that?&quot;

She had very nearly given up hope of finding anything suitable to wear 
out to the beach, and was gearing to tell Yuffie so, when she found the 
two-piece yellow swimsuit.

The top half managed to hold Tifa&#39;s breasts up, an embarrassing detail 
the woman found many other swimsuits could not manage. The bottom half 
didn&#39;t ride up into any...unspeakable regions, nor did it cut into the 
woman&#39;s body, so that skin seemed to overflow at the top.

Still, this didn&#39;t stop her from nervously checking herself every now 
and again. But this dilemma was not the swimsuit&#39;s fault, simply a 
problem of security, and this she knew.

Yuffie, extremely pleased with her choice, wore a black bikini, a choice 
that Tifa noted (with a quiet appreciation) complemented her creamy 
complexion.

Hugging her knees, Tifa watched the girl in question as she worked only 
a few yards away. Back bent and brow furrowed, Yuffie dug her hands deep 
into the wet sand, molding it, and shaping it. Inwardly, the woman 
laughed at how concentrated the girl seemed, as if she were performing 
some important or vital task. Tifa had to admit, however, that the ninja 
was right when she said how good she was at sand castles. She didn&#39;t 
know sand could shape the way Yuffie seemed to make it, her adroitness 
hinting to a long mastered skill.

The castle, as it was, was moderate in size and still growing. The outer 
wall was high and rolled surrealistically, bastions, small towers, 
making their places along the middle of each wall face. The tops of the 
walls were lined with battlements, a bartizan, an overhanging turret, 
set at each corner where the outer wall turned. The bailey, the castle 
courtyard, was flecked with small buildings, the center giving place to 
the largest buildings. Here, the keep, the tallest and largest tower, 
stretched to the sky.

Tifa gazed at the castle, her eyes marveling at all the details Yuffie 
managed to put in. A commotion to the woman&#39;s side, however, drew her 
attention away from the growing master piece.

The shrill cry of a little girl&#39;s scream caused many heads to turn and 
squint in question. Roving eyes found the answers they sought on a 
blubbery, red-headed boy, heavily freckled and terribly messy, who stood 
over a tiny blonde girl with a blue dress and pig tails. &quot;My castle, my 
castle!&quot; she screamed, anguished. The boy only grinned down at her, his 
pickle green eyes lighting as she clutched at the lump of sand that once 
was her castle. &quot;You killed it! You killed it!&quot; she screamed, face 
turned red. Standing, she ran away, still screaming. &quot;Mommy! Mommy! He 
killed it! He killed my castle!&quot;

The boy began to walk, many glares chasing after him as he went along. 
Tifa scowled at his face.

What a horrid little boy.

Then her eyes widened as she realized the boy was walking towards 
Yuffie&#39;s castle next.

Scrambling to her feet, Tifa hurried next to Yuffie, who now stood 
before her sand castle, hands on her hips, inspecting her craftsmanship. 
&quot;Um, Yuffie-&quot; Tifa began. The girl looked at her, a smug look on her 
face. &quot;See Rusty? No tools or anything! Just these!&quot; She held up her 
dirty hands.

Tifa nodded complacently, &quot;Yes, I know. You did great. But look there,&quot; 
the woman pointed past the girl, and Yuffie, frowning, looked to where 
she indicated. &quot;Do you see that boy walking towards us?&quot;

The ninja&#39;s eyebrows rose high. &quot;You mean the extremely fat one?&quot;

Tifa nodded gravely. &quot;Yes, that one.&quot;

Yuffie turned and looked back at Tifa, her eyebrow quirking in question. 
&quot;What about him?&quot;

Tifa bit her lip. &quot;Well, I just saw him destroy a little girl&#39;s sand 
castle. Right in front of her. He seems the really sadistic type, so I 
just thought I&#39;d warn you, I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll be able to resist what 
you&#39;ve done here. If he tries anything, I just want to make sure you 
won&#39;t kill him...&quot;

To the fighter&#39;s surprise, the girl smiled. &quot;Oh! Don&#39;t worry about that, 
Tif.&quot;

Tifa blinked, &quot;Really?&quot;

Yuffie nodded, a proud smile spreading across her face. &quot;Yeah! You see, 
since I don&#39;t use any tools, I have to use a lot of different stuff to 
reinforce the sand. Stuff like seaweed, sticks, shells-&quot;

&quot;INCOMING!&quot;

The two whirled around in time to see the fat boy running towards them. 
Tifa started forward, a look of outrage on her face, &quot;Hey-&quot; But Yuffie 
held her back, a sharp glint in her eye.

The fat boy crashed through the outer walls and smashing all the 
buildings. All except the keep. Swinging a leg back, the boy kicked at 
it hard, a vicious smile on his ruddy, rotund face. But when his foot 
connected, there was an audible &#39;thud&#39;, and without warning, the boy let 
out an ear-piercing scream, one to rival that of the little girl&#39;s. Tifa 
jerked back at the sound, hands flying to her ears as the boy hurriedly 
limped past them, up the beach. Through his sobs, the word, &quot;Mommy,&quot; 
could be heard, repeated over and over.

People around them clapped and cheered, appreciative smiles on their 
faces. Yuffie grinned and took a long bow.

Tifa, still not sure what happened, looked back at Yuffie&#39;s destroyed 
castle. &quot;But what-? ...Oh.&quot; Her face lit up in amusement, and turning, 
the fighter clapped slow, loud claps as Yuffie straightened. Pointing 
towards the castle, the fighter asked innocently. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t one call 
that &#39;cheating&#39;?&quot;

Yuffie shook her head, a smirk on her lips. &quot;Nope. I never used it as a 
tool, simply a building part.&quot;

Tifa rolled her eyes.

A large, smooth rock lay knocked askew in the sand, it&#39;s end still 
stubbornly pointing upwards.

----------

Changing back into their regular clothes, the two stashed their newly 
bought swimsuits in the side compartments of Yuffie&#39;s bike. Evening had 
come, and both were tired, Tifa especially. The coffee from that morning 
having long worn off, the woman moved and thought sluggishly, causing 
her temperament to take on a mellow, agreeable note, as they came back 
to the Oceanside Inn. As Yuffie pulled along the curb, she turned and 
asked Tifa over the growl of the motorbike, &quot;Hey, you wanna jes&#39; head 
back to Georgia&#39;s? I&#39;m too hungry to stop at some fancy restaurant and 
guess at what I&#39;m ordering.&quot;

Tifa shrugged. &quot;Sure.&quot; she said, as she climbed off the bike. She gave 
no further thought than that, and at the restaurant, the two girls ate 
in silence.

An hour or so later, the fighter sat back and sighed, her eyes dull with 
want of sleep. But Yuffie was leaning forward, a bright look in her eyes 
as she regarded the night sky through the restaurant window. &quot;Clear 
night. Just like last night.&quot;

Tifa didn&#39;t say anything. Head feeling thick and her breathing slow and 
rhythmic, the fighter watched the condensation of her glass roll down to 
the wooden table top.

Yuffie looked across the table at her. &quot;Y&#39;know, last night-&quot; Tifa&#39;s eyes 
shot up, their distant, sleepy look immediately disappearing. &quot;When I 
was up on the roof,&quot; the fighter relaxed. So she wasn&#39;t going to say 
anything...good. The ninja continued, not seeming to notice her friend&#39;s 
slight change in demeanor. &quot;I saw the whole of Costa Del Sol lit up. One 
of the coolest things I ever saw, I think...and I&#39;ve seen a lot of neat 
things, believe me.&quot; she leaned forward and sucked at her straw, the 
last of her soda slurping up loudly. Sitting back, she said, &quot;Anyways, I 
was just thinking, before you retire, that you&#39;d come up with me and see 
it. It&#39;s a great view, it really is.&quot;

Tifa was now looking warily at Yuffie. Another starlit night, alone? 
What would happen?

The woman rubbed at her eye. &quot;I dunno, Yuffie. I&#39;m really tired, 
y&#39;know...&quot;

Yuffie bit her lip and looked at Tifa with a pleading expression, 
&quot;Please?&quot; she asked. The woman tried to steel herself against it. &quot;She&#39;s 
just fooling around, again.&quot; Tifa thought. But as her eyes locked onto 
the girl&#39;s, the woman found that there was no jest. Yuffie was genuinely 
asking her.

For a moment the woman didn&#39;t say anything.

Then she nodded. &quot;All right...but only for a little bit. I mean it, I&#39;m 
really tired.&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s face lit up into a large grin, her dark eyes lighting 
momentarily with a deep glow that Tifa, for a moment, thought she only 
imagined.

Returning to the inn, the two were about to make their way up the stairs 
when Otis stood from his place behind the receptionist desk. &quot;Ms. 
Kisaragi?&quot;

Yuffie looked at him, eyebrow raising in question. &quot;Yeah?&quot;

The man leaned forward over the desk and held out an envelope. &quot;A man 
dropped this by about mid-afternoon. Said to give it to you.&quot;

Immediately, the girl&#39;s eyes darkened, and she took the envelope slowly. 
Eyes still on Otis, she asked warily, &quot;Did&#39;ja get a good look at the 
guy?&quot;

Otis thought for a moment, &quot;Um...well, he was a young guy, with dark 
eyes and hair. He was from the West, like yourself. Dressed in a suit. 
Can&#39;t remember much other than that.&quot;

The girl sighed and nodded. &quot;All right...thanks, Otis.&quot;

Tifa waited until they were on the second floor to say, &quot;So you&#39;re 
father wants you back, huh?&quot;

Yuffie sneered. &quot;&#39;Course he does. But I&#39;m not going to be intimidated by 
any crony he sends my way. What the hell does he think I am? A little 
girl?&quot; The ninja angrily stuffed the envelope in her coat.

Tifa thought for a moment. &quot;Yuffie...&quot; the woman slowed to a stop. The 
ninja looked back at her, confused.

&quot;Yeah, Tif?&quot; She asked.

Tifa gazed somberly at her. &quot;This thing with your father...&quot; she paused, 
trying to organize the words in her head. &quot;...You&#39;d clue me in if there 
was anything important I should know about...right?&quot;

Yuffie nodded, a small frown appearing on her face. &quot;Uh, sure.&quot;

The woman wet her lips and rubbed at her arms. &quot;And you wouldn&#39;t 
be...using me as an excuse...or as a tool or anything...right?&quot;

The girl stepped forward at this, her frown deepening and her gaze 
turning sharp. &quot;Well of course I wouldn&#39;t!&quot;

Tifa winced at the indignation in her friend&#39;s voice. Hunching her 
shoulders about her ears, the fighter looked shamefully down at the 
floor. &quot;I just...I just wanted to know...&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s hands shot forward and grabbed onto the woman&#39;s arms. Startled, 
Tifa looked up with a jerk, a small gasp escaping her mouth as her eyes 
locked onto Yuffie&#39;s. The girl was staring with wide, intense eyes.

&quot;Listen to me...&quot; she said, her voice hard.

Tifa looked down quickly, her hands reaching up and finding place at the 
girl&#39;s shoulders, ready to push her away. &quot;Yuffie-!&quot;

&quot;No! Look at me! You&#39;ve got to listen!&quot; her voice shook as she said 
this.

Slowly, the woman looked up. Yuffie&#39;s expression now seemed desperate, 
her eyebrows pushing up in entreaty.

&quot;Whatever...Whatever stupid crap is going on between me and my 
pop&#39;s...Tifa, it&#39;s got nothing to do with you! I would NEVER want to 
involve you in anything that wasn&#39;t your affair!&quot; Yuffie&#39;s grip on 
Tifa&#39;s arm tightened slightly. Her voice dropped to a passionate hiss, 
&quot;And I would never use you as a weapon...okay? You got that? You&#39;re my 
friend. You&#39;re...You&#39;re special to me. Okay?&quot;

Tifa nodded, feeling guilty. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; she stepped forward hugged the 
girl around the neck, her need to reassure overcoming all else. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, I&#39;m so sorry...it&#39;s just...&quot; The woman stomped a foot and tried 
to keep her emotions under control. &quot;Damn Barret! Damn him!&quot;

Yuffie hugged her back. She allowed a moment to go by before pulling 
back and asking, &quot;What did that one-armed bastard say?&quot; her expression 
was ominous.

Tifa shook her head. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, Yuffie. He was just being 
himself...worrying over me. But I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean...I didn&#39;t mean 
to-&quot;

The ninja shook her head. &quot;That&#39;s enough. That&#39;s enough.&quot; Grabbing 
Tifa&#39;s hand, the girl turned, &quot;Let&#39;s just hurry up and get to the roof.&quot;

----------

The stars were the tears of the gods, each twinkle a sign of their 
continually breaking hearts. Tifa looked up at them all, her lips parted 
slightly in silent wonder. So many stars...so much blood. Yet the 
anguish was beautiful. The pain was what allowed people to dream. For 
every star, a new hope. For every drop of blood, a new smile.

The woman closed her eyes and breathed in deeply, willing some 
revelation, some idea to enter her mind. How to solve the problem? Could 
it be called a problem? Or was it simply the way things worked?

Tifa opened her eyes again.

No idea came to her.

Yuffie stood off ahead of her near the roof&#39;s edge, her hands gripping 
the guard rail loosely as she looked out at the city. Costa Del Sol, as 
if trying to live up to its name, refused to go out at night. The glow 
of the night life was warm and bled out into the night sky, a show of 
defiance.

Yuffie&#39;s eyes were low, the lights of Costa Del Sol igniting a fire in 
them.

Tifa gazed at her back, her arms remaining still at her sides. Ideas of 
things to say popped in her head; cute jokes, clever conversation 
starters, deep philosophical epiphanies. But the woman sighed and looked 
down at her shoes, dark shapes as the faint light disappeared about her 
waist.

None of the things Tifa thought of seemed sincere enough.

Yuffie, heaving a sigh of her own, turned her body a quarter ways 
around, one hand leaving the guard rail as she leaned sideways. Her gaze 
remained on the city, however. &quot;Hey, Tifa?&quot;

Tifa looked up at her meekly. &quot;Yes, Yuffie?&quot;

The girl remained silent for a moment. Then she asked, &quot;What do you 
think makes a person say they&#39;re happy?&quot;

The woman frowned and hugged her arms, rubbing warmth into them. After a 
moment, she shrugged one shoulder. &quot;Depends on the person, I suppose.&quot;

Yuffie pursed her lips. Head swinging around to look at Tifa, the girl 
smiled sardonically. &quot;Dead loved ones, a dysfunctional family, and a 
whole mess of misunderstandings...I must be crazy to feel so optimistic 
all the time.&quot;

Tifa grinned slightly. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t one call you a pessimist just for 
talking that way?&quot; she asked in a light, teasing, tone.

Yuffie returned her grin. Turning her body all the way around, she 
leaned back against the railing, crossing her legs at the ankles and 
crossing her arms loosely. &quot;Maybe.&quot; she said, looking to the side.

Tifa went to stand at her side, leaning forward onto the guard rail with 
her elbows. &quot;You&#39;re thinking those thoughts again, Yuffie.&quot; The girl&#39;s 
eyes fell on the side of Tifa&#39;s face. The woman continued without 
looking up. &quot;You&#39;re thinking those thoughts that unravel the world. 
You&#39;ve got to be careful treading down those roads...they can make you 
cynical.&quot;

The girl only raised an eyebrow. &quot;That&#39;s why you walk the world with a 
mirror, Tif&#39;.&quot; Tifa looked at her with a frown. Yuffie elaborated, &quot;You 
walk the world with a mirror, and you show the wrong-doers what they&#39;re 
doing wrong. You scare the evil away with their own reflection. Evil 
hates seeing itself for what it is.&quot;

Tifa nodded. &quot;A very deep philosophy.&quot;

Yuffie smirked. &quot;Yeah, I wish I followed it more often.&quot;

They both laughed.

The ninja ran a hand through her hair and looked up. &quot;But I really do 
wonder what makes a person say their happy. Just what the hell does 
happiness amount to anyways? Never having problems? Or being able to 
grow and prosper as a person?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d say the last one.&quot; Tifa said.

Yuffie frowned. &quot;Me an&#39; my old man. We argue tons. Argue all the time. 
Used to be a time when I listened to him...kinda. At least I respected 
him. But then Shinra came and...&quot; the girl smiled crookedly. &quot;Tragic 
stories always start with, &#39;But then Shinra came.&#39;&quot; Yuffie snorted and 
rubbed furiously at her eyes. Tifa gazed quietly at her, waiting 
patiently for the girl to continue. The ninja heaved a heavy sigh and 
crossed her arms again. &quot;Anyways, you&#39;ve heard that story a ton of 
times...but you wanna know what&#39;s got me so steamed at my dad now? 
What&#39;s got me so damn pissed off?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Tifa asked, straightening.

Yuffie grit her teeth. &quot;He broke his promise to me! He said he wouldn&#39;t 
make Wutai into some stupid tourist resort! Said he wouldn&#39;t dare 
degrade us like that again, but-!&quot; the girl took a deep breath, trying 
to keep from shouting. Closing her eyes, she continued in a voice that 
shook a little, &quot;He lied. He gave up trying to be honorable. Gave it up 
because he&#39;s too incompetent to think of how Wutai can support itself 
without resorting to serving sake to big shot CEO&#39;s from Junon.&quot; The 
girl swallowed hard and wiped at her nose with a furious swipe of her 
arm. &quot;And he wanted me to go along with it. Said I had to help if it was 
going to work. Wanted me to-&quot; the girl stopped again. Opening her eyes 
again, she stared silently forward.

Tifa watched her quietly, her brows furrowed. Even from where she stood, 
the fighter could tell the young girl was tense all over. Hesitantly, 
the woman made as if to touch the girl&#39;s shoulder, but then without 
warning, Yuffie&#39;s eyes had snapped onto hers. The fiery glow was still 
in her gaze, but this was her passion that lit them so bright, not the 
city&#39;s.

Tifa pulled back her hand, embarrassed and a little startled.

&quot;After this. After I cool down and get my head on straight, I&#39;m gonna 
start making changes.&quot; the girl looked down at her shoes, &quot;Actually, 
that&#39;s part of the reason I wanted to go on this road trip. I wanted to 
visit Reeve. In Mideel. He knows a lot of things that can help me, and 
has the resources, too. I figure if I talk to him, then I can draw up 
some kinda battle plan, cuz&#39; I can&#39;t let my old man get away with what 
he&#39;s trying to do. I just can&#39;t.&quot;

Tifa nodded. &quot;I understand, Yuffie. I don&#39;t mind that at all.&quot;

Yuffie looked at her and smiled gratefully. &quot;Thanks...and hey, don&#39;t 
worry about this trip! Even though I wanna talk to Reeve, we don&#39;t have 
to hurry ourselves. In fact, my dad can&#39;t really do anything until I 
give in.&quot; the girl rolled her eyes. &quot;Like I&#39;d ever do that.&quot;

Tifa smirked. &quot;Yeah. You&#39;d just as soon die first.&quot;

&quot;Damn straight!&quot; Yuffie paused, then she gave the woman a suspicious 
look. &quot;Hey...what was that supposed to mean?&quot;

The woman chuckled slightly. &quot;I said you&#39;re more stubborn than an 
adamantoise.&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s cheeks pinked slightly. &quot;Take that back!&quot;

Tifa backed up, carefully, a mischievous grin on her face. &quot;Take what 
back? The fact that I said you were about as determined as a tonberry 
hunting for dinner?&quot;

The girl advanced on her menacingly, but humor was in her eyes.

Tifa continued backing away, her hands held before her in case the ninja 
decided to spring at her. &quot;Oh, but no! Calling you a tonberry would just 
insinuate that you were slow...&quot; the woman paused her movement. Raising 
an eyebrow she pretended to think. &quot;Well...maybe that isn&#39;t so far 
off...&quot;

Yuffie pounded her fist into her palm. &quot;Oh you&#39;re going to seriously 
regret that!&quot; And with that she pushed forward, hands swiping towards 
Tifa in a wild grab. Tifa narrowly avoided them, laughter bursting from 
her throat as she turned and ran across the roof, toward a set of 
sunbathing chairs.

Running to the other side, Tifa looked back in time to see Yuffie 
cycling around the obstacles, but the woman moved quickly away from her, 
panting slightly as she fought to keep the chairs between herself and 
the ninja. A few run abouts, and the young girl finally figured out that 
she simply needed to leap over the chairs to get to what she wanted. 
Tifa shrieked as Yuffie came bounding toward her, hands reaching out to 
grab her. The fighter danced away as one of the girl&#39;s hands missed, but 
another swipe caught her arm, and Yuffie clung on fiercely, refusing to 
let go.

Just as she caught Tifa, the fighter lost her balance, her feet running 
into each other as she tried to turn away from her friend. The woman 
felt herself falling, and Yuffie, hand gripping onto Tifa&#39;s firmly, felt 
herself falling with her.

In a moment, they were on the floor, a dazed heap, both suffering their 
own injuries. Tifa blinked dazedly up at the sky, aware of a sharp pain 
at the back of her head. Yuffie pulled her face up from Tifa&#39;s shoulder, 
her eyes spaced and her hair falling into her eyes.

&quot;Well that&#39;s a nice way to fall.&quot; the girl said, looking dazedly at 
Tifa&#39;s face.

The woman winced and lifted her head up some, a hand reaching back to 
feel for any serious damage. &quot;Ouch...&quot; she breathed.

Yuffie pushed herself up onto her hands and knees. Hovering over the 
woman, the girl asked quickly. &quot;You bleeding?&quot;

Tifa shook her head. &quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Your not feeling too dizzy? Nauseous?&quot;

&quot;No, no. I just need...a second. Give me a second, then I&#39;ll get up.&quot;

The girl dropped her head, so that Tifa couldn&#39;t see her face. Then 
suddenly, Yuffie began to laugh. Her body shook with the laughter, and 
the fighter stared up at her. Lifting her head again, Yuffie said 
through giggles. &quot;We&#39;re such losers! Look at us! Acting like we&#39;re 
twelve and getting hurt for it!&quot; the girl continued to laugh. For a 
moment, Tifa was bewildered. Then, she began to laugh too.

When the two calmed down, Tifa looked up into Yuffie&#39;s face, dark in the 
faint light of the evening. She became increasingly aware of the fact 
that the girl had not stood up yet.

The girl&#39;s eyes were turning intense, a strangely soft, but disarming 
gleam coming about them that made the woman&#39;s stomach churn. Heart beat 
quickening, Tifa asked quietly. &quot;Yuffie, are you going to get up?&quot;

The girl didn&#39;t answer. Her eyes roved Tifa&#39;s face slowly, as if sifting 
out her secrets and desires.

Like a deer caught in the headlights, the fighter froze under this 
scrutiny.

After a moment, Yuffie raised an eyebrow. &quot;Y&#39;know, I&#39;ve now realized, I 
can&#39;t ignore it. Not at all. There are some things people can deny 
themselves, but I found I have no reason to deny it. And because I know 
this...I can&#39;t.&quot;

Tifa gulped, her face turning red. &quot;Deny...what?&quot;

Yuffie smiled softly. &quot;We did good, today, didn&#39;t we? Ignoring it? For 
the most part, we did, at least. I bet you don&#39;t want to think about it. 
But I can&#39;t ignore it. I gave you a day. I just can&#39;t ignore it.&quot;

Tifa looked past Yuffie&#39;s head to the starry night sky.

Yuffie placed a hand on Tifa&#39;s cheek, and the woman&#39;s eyes reluctantly 
returned to the girl&#39;s intense gaze.

&quot;The night before. We came close, didn&#39;t we? Both of us. It wasn&#39;t just 
me, it was both of us. But that wasn&#39;t the first time. There were other 
times. Other times I thought...but we didn&#39;t. Last night we nearly did.&quot; 
Yuffie tilted her head to one side. &quot;And you&#39;d rather forget about it, 
wouldn&#39;t you? Not because you&#39;re disgusted. Not because you&#39;re not 
interested. It&#39;s because you&#39;re scared to death.&quot;

Tifa stared up with wide eyes. She opened her mouth to say something, 
then realized she didn&#39;t know what to say. She closed it again with a 
snap.

&quot;Who do you think of. Y&#39;know, when you&#39;re afraid? Who do you see? What 
things do you think will happen?&quot;

Tifa made as if to sit up. &quot;Let me up.&quot; she said, shortly.

Yuffie placed a hand on her shoulder. &quot;Please, just answer my question.&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to let me up?&quot;

&quot;And you wouldn&#39;t run away the moment I let you?&quot;

Tifa glared, &quot;So you&#39;re going to hold me here against my will?&quot;

Yuffie sighed. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean it like that, it&#39;s just-&quot; she carefully 
got to her feet.

Tifa stared up at her a moment before standing slowly as well. The back 
of her head still throbbed.

&quot;It&#39;s just that we really need to talk about this...&quot; Yuffie finished, 
an apologetic look on her face. &quot;You know as well as I do that we have 
to talk about this. Maybe my timing wasn&#39;t so great, but you know we 
need to talk, Tifa. You know it.&quot;

Tifa turned her head and looked out at the city. Her body shook.

She did know it.

Yuffie sighed, &quot;I never planned it, y&#39;know. Are you mad at me because 
you thought I planned it? &#39;Cuz just so you know, I never planned it. I 
never planned any of it!&quot;

Tifa closed her eyes and shook her head. &quot;No, Yuffie...I never got mad 
at you, and I never thought that.&quot;

&quot;Well if you&#39;re not mad, then you&#39;re scared. But I don&#39;t know what 
you&#39;re scared of. Who or what is it that&#39;s making you afraid?&quot;

The fighter looked at her. &quot;It isn&#39;t any one thing. It&#39;s a bunch of 
things. A bunch of things that tell me what I feel-&quot; the woman stopped 
abruptly, her face turning redder. &quot;...There are a bunch of things 
telling me it&#39;s all wrong somehow.&quot;

&quot;The voices,&quot; Yuffie tapped the side of her head. &quot;In there. Right? 
That&#39;s all you hear?&quot;

Tifa nodded stiffly, her gaze turning down to her shoes.

Yuffie smirked. &quot;So what voices are you hearing? The PC Police, the 
Religious Fanatics, or the Suburban Housewife?&quot;

The older woman smiled weakly at the attempt at humor. &quot;The last one, I 
think.&quot;

&quot;The one that tells you what&#39;s normal and what isn&#39;t? The one that says 
you ought to be getting married and having a family someday?&quot;

&quot;Yes...that one.&quot;

Yuffie scratched the back of her head. &quot;I had problems with her after 
Meteor. For a second, I felt almost obligated to just hitch up with the 
first guy I saw. I figured out really quick that she was just full of 
it, though. I helped save the world and saw all sorts of crazy 
stuff...who&#39;s a disembodied voice to tell me what&#39;s normal and what 
isn&#39;t?&quot;

Tifa shook her head and looked up at Yuffie. &quot;And you&#39;re just so 
comfortable with how you feel, aren&#39;t you? Doesn&#39;t it bother you at all? 
Don&#39;t you have doubts?&quot;

The girl frowned. &quot;Doubts about what? What use does second-guessing do 
if I don&#39;t stop long enough to lie to myself? Do you think I&#39;m 
entertaining thoughts of &#39;love eternal&#39; and all that? No! But I know 
when I want something. I&#39;ll be frank. I never gave a thought to girls 
until I started spending time with you. I don&#39;t mean to make you 
embarrassed, but it&#39;s true! ...And maybe...maybe it explains things. 
Maybe it explains why I can&#39;t get into relationships with guys longer&#39;n 
a week. Maybe it explains why sex doesn&#39;t interest me as it once did, 
because the mystery of it is gone and I found that the answer was 
dissatisfying. Maybe I&#39;m just making a fuss out of nothing, but damn it, 
I know when I want something, Tifa! And what I want is you!&quot;

Tifa stared timidly at Yuffie, her heart hammering painfully against her 
chest and a clean sheen of sweat glistening on her skin.

Yuffie had lifted her chin slightly, her shoulders pulled back as her 
eyes held onto Tifa&#39;s gaze fiercefully. She was baring herself open. 
Heart and soul. Spreading out her feelings and thoughts without shame or 
fear, for it was as she said; she knew what she wanted, and as stated 
earlier by the girl herself, her way of going about things was all or 
nothing.

All. Or nothing.

&quot;And there...so I said it.&quot; Yuffie&#39;s eyes became light, and the woman 
was surprised to see the girl suddenly smile. &quot;No pussy-footing around. 
No beating around the bush. I said it, plain as day. Now I don&#39;t have to 
ignore it anymore. Now I don&#39;t have to pretend. I hate pretending. I 
never pretended before. I did now, because things were different. But 
now I don&#39;t have to.&quot; Yuffie&#39;s smile widened. &quot;Whether or not you decide 
you want to give this lesbian crap a swing, I&#39;ll still be okay. I&#39;ve 
figured something out about myself. Something that had been missing 
before. But now I know...&quot; the girl nodded, more to herself it seemed, 
and turned to leave.

Tifa watched her, frozen at her place, as Yuffie walked back to the roof 
access. She had her hands hooked into her front pockets and was looking 
down. At the door, the girl paused, and looked back at Tifa. &quot;Tell me in 
the morning, how you feel. If you want to go back home...well, that&#39;s 
okay. I&#39;d understand. But I need to know how you feel. I don&#39;t mean to 
kind of push you, but I don&#39;t want this to sit between us like a wall, 
y&#39;know?&quot; the girl smiled and waved at her friend. &quot;G&#39;night, Tifa.&quot; And 
with that she disappeared back inside.

For a long time, the woman didn&#39;t move.

Then she turned and stared out at the city. It&#39;s fiery lights burned 
toward the heavens. A show of defiance.

A show of passion.
