<h1>Date Game</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/trythis.html">Try This Pen Name</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was raining outside; it had been for the last few days that they had 
been there. Or maybe that was just how it always was at the Spooky Inn 
or whatever in the hell they wanted to call it.

The martial artist was lying on the bed, idly reading a magazine she 
bought on the way in. It was probably the only thing she got for a 
decent price in this amusement park. Her petite feet were suspended in 
the air as she kicked her calves up and down in boredom.

At the large vanity mirror, the flower girl was combing her hair. The 
long honey brown locks were free from their ponytail and their newly 
revealed length rivaled the fighters on hair. She was still dressed in 
her clothes, still unsure of whether or not she wished to end her day. 
Her bright green eyes stared at her reflection as she continued to primp 
and polish. The hair now had a perfect sheen after what felt like a 
bazillion strokes. Green eyes soon closed, the brush was placed down, 
and a sigh was heard.

&quot;I&#39;m bored&quot;

Wine colored eyes looked up, meeting bright green ones. The fighter 
favored the other girl an exasperated look. &quot;So do something,&quot; she 
simply said and she continued to read her magazine.

She smiled when she felt the other girl pout. She was always cute when 
she pouted.

&quot;Tifa...&quot; came the childish whine.

When she did this, Tifa always wondered if she really was older than 
her.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m bored. Play with me?&quot;

Tifa&#39;s heart skips a beat. That sounded wrong on so many levels. The 
fighter looked up shyly, unsure if she heard right. The flower girl is 
smiling sweetly from her seat, her bright eyes staring down on the other 
girl. She smirks and the fighter blushes.

Tifa inwardly groans. And it was times like this...that she remembered 
that she was.

&quot;No thank you, I&#39;m tired,&quot; she curtly says, reverting her eyes back to 
her magazine.

Aeris looks disappointed. &quot;Aw...too bad...guess I&#39;ll....go on a date 
with Cloud!&quot; she declares, snapping her fingers.

&quot;What?&quot; Tifa looks up. That certainly got her attention. She sits up in 
the bed.

&quot;I said, I&#39;m going on a date with Cloud. I do owe him one as payment as 
my body guard,&quot; Aeris replies innocently, turning to put some make-up 
on.

&quot;B-but...you... you can&#39;t!&quot; Tifa protests lamely. God she sounded like 
an idiot.

Aeris sends her a look, as she crosses her arms. &quot;And why &#150; pray tell &#150; 
can&#39;t I?&quot;

&quot;Because...&quot; Because what? &quot;Because...&quot; You love Cloud...? Or is it 
something else? Tifa didn&#39;t admit it, but the little flower girl had 
etched out a nice little place in her heart...and not just as her rival 
for Cloud&#39;s love... Maybe she just wanted her to stay...but for what 
reason?...she just could not say.

&quot;Because...?&quot; Aeris prompted, her eyes flashing.

Tifa wouldn&#39;t back away from a challenge.

&quot;Because I want to go on a date with him as well!&quot;

&quot;I thought you said you were tired&quot; Aeris pointed out, with a slightly 
annoyed look.

&quot;Second wind I guess&quot; Tifa grinned sheepishly.

Aeris was quiet. Tifa was quiet. The room was quiet. Then the flower 
looked thoughtful and then smiled brightly. &quot;Ok then&quot;

&quot;Ok...what?&quot; The chocolate-haired girl blinked. Surely Aeris wasn&#39;t 
suggesting a threesome...date.

&quot;We&#39;ll compete to see who goes!&quot;

&quot;How?&quot;

&quot;Rock-Paper-Scissors!&quot; a voice cried excitedly.

Both girls turned in alarm as Barrett and Yuffie entered the room. 
&quot;Barrett...Yuffie...what are you...?&quot; Tifa trailed off in confusion. 
Barrett had the nerve to look embarrassed, scratching the back of his 
head, while Yuffie went over and sat by Aeris cross-legged.

&quot;Let&#39;s play Rock-Paper-Scissors!&quot; she suggested again. &quot;To decide who 
will go on Cloud&#39;s date!&quot;

&quot;You wish to play?&quot; Aeris inquired with a smile. Yuffie nodded 
enthusiastically.

&quot;And...you?&quot; Tifa cried, looking at Barrett. Perhaps...she did not know 
him as well as she ought to have. Who would&#39;ve thought Cloud would have 
so many admirers.

&quot;It ain&#39;t like that! I was...well I was-er-hearin you talk and...&quot;

&quot;Ah shut up Barrett and let&#39;s play!&quot; Yuffie snapped.

Barrett scowled and sent her a dark look, but said nothing else. Aeris 
giggled and looked at the bemused Tifa.

&quot;Shall we play?&quot; she asked, her eyes twinkling brightly.

Tifa sighed and gave a smile. &quot;Why not?&quot;

And so they played.

Barrett was the first the go, but it was unsurprising. He put a 
half-hearted attempt into winning and seemed relieved when he lost. He 
bid everyone good night and turned to leave.

Yuffie was a bit more persistent, but eventually gave up in defeat. She 
whined a bit before getting sleepy, and deciding to head back to her own 
room.

It was now down to Tifa and Aeris. And right now it was a stalemate. The 
tension in the room was so thick it could be cut with a Cloud&#39;s hair.

It had gotten very hot. Tifa noted. And that was saying something 
considering she had stripped her clothes ages ago. Aeris too was 
undressed and seemed very flustered. Tifa almost laughed. Whose idea was 
it for them to strip? Wasn&#39;t it raining outside, so shouldn&#39;t it be 
cold?

&quot;So I guess it will be decided in this one move, eh Lockheart?&quot; came 
Aeris&#39;s cocky reply. She gave Tifa a furtive smile.

Was she smiling seductively at her? Tifa swallowed. This was it...the 
topping on the cake...the big finale...it was now or never...do or 
die...swim or fly...

&quot;Will you cut that out!&quot; Aeris suddenly said.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re talking allowed again&quot;

&quot;Oh...Sorry...&quot;

&quot;Ok, now where were we...oh yeah, this is the part where I convince you 
to forget Cloud and stay with me instead!&quot; Aeris declares as she flips 
threw her script.

&quot;What...!&quot; Tifa begins flipping through her script.

&quot;No wait...wrong Shoujo-ai fic. Erm...ahem. Anyway...what I meant to say 
was let&#39;s get it on!&quot; Aeris raises her hand.

Tifa feels her heart beating wildly as she does the same. Time seems to 
go in slow motion.

&quot;Roooooooooooooooooooooooooooocccccccckkkkkkkkkkkkk...&quot;

Ok, not that slow.

&quot;Paper...&quot;

Tifa closes her eyes as she throws down her final hand, but is suddenly 
stopped when she feels warm lips press up against hers. She didn&#39;t even 
want to think about the very hot, half-naked girl, pressing up against 
her own half-naked body. Her eyes snap open in surprise and so does her 
hand, giving her the paper signal instead of the rock that she had 
chose.

Aeris grins in satisfaction as she pulls away, holding up her own sign &#150; 
the scissors.

&quot;You...you...&quot;

&quot;Mm...that was fun!&quot; Aeris giggles, licking her lips.

&quot;You...you...&quot; Tifa continues to sputter, speechless.

&quot;Well, how about them apples? I guess me and Cloudy are going on a 
date!&quot; She grins as she gets dress and ready to leave.

&quot;You...you...&quot;

&quot;See you Tifa...&quot; Aeris smiles as she leans down next to Tifa&#39;s ear. 
&quot;How about next time you and me, go out?&quot; she whispers, nibbling on the 
lobe before exiting the room.

&quot;You...you...&quot;

It wasn&#39;t until hours later that Tifa got her voice back.

&quot;YOU BITCH!&quot;

There we go.

And that...ladies and gents, is why Tifa hates Aeris. And why their 
respective fans will always fight and hate each other.</pre>
