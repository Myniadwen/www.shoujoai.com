&#147;Hmm, does that hurt,&#148; he asks with a maniacal smile on his face.
_____________________________________________________

	&#147;So, you are his guardian?&#148;

	&#147;Yes, here are the papers.&#148;&#148;

	&#147;Why didn&#146;t you look for him?&#148;

	&#147;If he is gone it makes my job easier.&#148;

	&#147;You are an evil..&#148;

	&#147;Stop now!&#148;  &#147;It is hard to take care of two hundred children, with
one gone it is just easier!&#148;  &#147;Now, end his misery!&#148;

	&#147;Fine.&#148;

	Beep..Beep..Beep&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;

	&#147;I am sorry, &#133;Jacob.&#148;
_____________________________________________________

	Kerek holds the blade to her throat, taunting her with his
power over her life.  &#147;To kill or not to kill?&#148;  &#147;I chose kill,&#148; he
shouts, pulling the sword back for the next attack.
_____________________________________________________

	&#147;I don&#146;t want to dream&#133;&#148;

	&#147;Did he just speak?&#148;

	&#147;I don&#146;t want to dream.&#148;

	&#147;What?&#148;

	&#147;I thought I told you to unplug him.&#148;

	&#147;I did!&#148;

	&#147;I.. I.. I DON&#148;T WANT TO DREAAAAAAAM!&#148;
_____________________________________________________

	&#147;Not yet,&#148; screams Kerek, suddenly.  He drops his sword
and falls to his knees (grasping his head).  &#147;No, not yet, you
can&#146;t!&#148; he screams into the air.  His body begins to glow an eerie
blue, as he floats to up, into the air.

	&#147;Hmm (cough), does it hurt (cough),&#148; laughs Spin.

	His body flies into the air and collides with the &#145;Spiral&#146;
(while destroying a few &#145;Fate&#146; whom are ripped in half).   The sky
turns to the same shade of blue.

	Sadness&#133;

	&#147;What is going on,&#148; yells Amber as her and the others exit
the large building.  &#147;Wait, Spin!&#148;

	Ike and Gary&#146;s bodies begin to glow dark yellow as they
too fly into the sky.

	The need to find ones self&#133;..

	Amber runs towards where Spin set on the ground,
bleeding.  Suddenly her lover&#146;s body starts to glow red and float
into the air (along with the &#145;Fate&#146; who are glowing green).

Love&#133;..

    Fight
 &#147;Spin,&#148; Amber yells, throwing her hands into the air,
trying to grab the large red ball.  All of the colors mix, and the sky
glow a golden color.

	Completion&#133;.

	&#147;He has awoken.&#148;

	&#147;Hello Jacob.&#148;

	&#147;Hmm, hi!&#148;

	&#147;Damn, now he is back.&#148;

	&#147;Don&#146;t worry, I&#146;d be glad to adopt him, if it is okay with you.&#148;

	&#147;Great!&#148;
_____________________________________________________

	&#147;Spin, no..&#148;
_____________________________________________________

	&#147;I don&#146;t understand, what is going on, why Spin.&#148;

	&#147;Lea, I thought you are a genius.&#148;

	&#147;I am, but this makes no sense.&#148;

	&#147;Okay, listen.&#148;  &#147;Two years ago the boy in the waking
world confessed his love to a young girl, but she turned him down,
on that day he gave up on love, thus creating Spin in the realm of
dreams.&#148;

	&#147;What about Ike and Gary?&#148;

	&#147;Ike and Gary where created to find himself and bring it
back, and a little of his humorous side.&#148;

	&#147;Kerek/Zero?&#148;

	&#147;&#148;Kerek is his emotion of sadness and his conscious mind
itself, while Zero is his sub conscious, what he wants to be.&#148;

	&#147;His dreams?

	&#147;Correct.&#148;

	&#147; And the &#147;Spiral&#146; and the &#145;Fate&#146; are?&#148;

	&#147;His anger and hatred.&#148;

	&#147;Think this will happen again?&#148;

	&#147;Possibly, but we can&#146;t let anyone know about it now.&#148;

	&#147;You&#146;re going to erase their memories.&#148;

	&#147;Of the whole situation.&#148;

	&#147;What about the memories of Spin?&#148;

	&#147;Not those three.&#148;  &#147;Only everyone else.&#148;
_____________________________________________________

Three Months Later:

	Amber sat around with her friends at the Pizza Place
where her and Spin met.  &#147;Congratz on the engagement again.&#148;

	Tifa sighs before answering her best friend, &#147;You&#146;ve said
it twelve times.&#148;

	&#147;And we never get tired of it!&#146; interrupts Yuffie.  She pulls
Tifa into a corner before talking aloud.  &#147;She needs to keep her
mind off of Spin, okay?&#148;

	&#147;Fine&#148; Tifa sighs, before walking back over to Amber.
&#147;So, how are you doing lately?&#148;

	&#147;Not so good, I can&#146;t live without Spin.&#148;

	&#147;Listen, we loved Spin too, but you gotta move on,&#148; yells
Yuffie, still trying to sound compassionate.

	&#147;I miss her too much.&#148;

	Tifa stares blankly over Ambers shoulder.  &#147;Oh my
Goddess!&#148;

	&#147;What,&#148; asks Yuffie, looking over Ambers shoulder.

	&#147;I said I miss her,&#148; repeats Amber.

	&#147;You miss who?&#148; a voice rings from the background.

	Amber turns and sees a vision loveliness (though very
dirty, and wearing a ripped shirt).  &#147;S&#133;&#133;&#133;.
