<h1>A Little Bar-Mad Shoujo-ai (part 1 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yurikitty.html">Yuri Kitty</a><br> </h2>
<pre>       Intro: Work with me here, people. I am mostly just improvising... 
this is my first shoujo-ai fanfic... I have plenty of shounen-ai... but 
no shoujo-ai. I suppose that&#39;s beside the point. Like any partially 
insane or hentai/yaoi/yuri slob like me *teehee*, you would think Tifa 
Lockheart is hot *pppppuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrr...... ~_~*. Therefore, 
using distastefulness to piss some people off ((*wink*)), I have decided 
to write a shoujo-ai fanfic, creating a character for myself. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

       The doors to the bar where Tifa Lockheart worked flew open ((I do 
not know the name of the bar... work with me here, people. ^^)). The 
nasty and drunk, scruffy men who were in there, looked up. There mouths 
fell open in appreciation and sexual turn-on-yness when they saw who 
stepped into the bar. It was a girl about 5&#39;4&quot; feet tall with tannish 
skin. She was skinny, and wearing a VERY sexy outfit including: a tight 
crimson belly shirt and a tight leather navy blue skirt. Around her 
waist, was a loose-fitting violet belt. She had jet back hair that went 
down to just below her shoulder blades and full, open juicy-red lips. 
She also resembled an Asian; at least, on Earth, it would be an Asian.
       But enough of a desciption. You get the idea, right? She was HOT. 
*heehee*
       In stepped the girl. The guys all stared at her. They all 
instantly became horny; well... at least most of them did. Some of them 
were either passed out or gay, so they remained uninterested. ^_~
       The girl ((who also had a gun holster around her right thigh)) 
walked up to the bar, behind which Tifa was standing. She looked at Tifa 
and smiled. &quot;Gimme a beer.&quot; She said.
       Tifa looked at her, a little suspiciously. &quot;Beer?&quot; The 
hot-new-no-name girl smiled again and nodded her head. Tifa, not wanting 
to argue or even ask any questions, shrugged and handed the girl a beer. 
She accepted it, brushing her hand against Tifa&#39;s. Tifa noticed this; 
the act was not at all accidental. For some reason, the girl tounching 
her skin made her hot. Her heart thumped and she even felt her cheeks 
begin to grow a little hot with blushing.
       /Why?// She thought to herself, very confused. /This girl is no 
Cloud... And I&#39;m not a lez... So why am I so... turned on by her?// 
Tifa&#39;s gaze was locked onto the girls. The more that they looked at each 
other, the more Tifa began to feel weak with sexuality. When she 
realized this, she instantly cleared her throat and turned away from the 
girl. Not looking at her, she started to wipe down the bar as the 
no-name girl took a seat on one of the stools and still gazed at Tifa, 
smiling. Tifa knew what she wanted. She got that same look from every 
scumbag, drunken douche-bastard who came into the bar; all looking for a 
little action. Because of her love for Cloud, however, she never let 
them touch her without SERIOUS consequences.
       Tifa tried then to make a little idle converstaion. &quot;What&#39;s your 
name?&quot; She asked the girl. Her gaze did still not return to the girl&#39;s 
eyes. She was somewhat scared of looking into her eyes again. She was a 
little scared by her sexual feelings for this girl. All of it was all 
too new to her.
       The girl laughed lightly. &quot;My name is Chii.&quot; ((side note: NO 
RESEMBLANCE TO &#39;CHOBITS&#39;! &gt;.&lt;)). The light and somewhat even flirtateous 
and mysterious way the girl laughed and talked drew Tifa to her even 
more; with no explanation why.
       &quot;How old are you?&quot; Tifa asked, still not meeting this Chii-girl&#39;s 
eyes.
       &quot;Nineteen.&quot; She replied. She then reached out her hand and 
touched Tifa&#39;s forearm lightly. This surprised Tifa and she no longer 
avoided Chii&#39;s gaze; she looked up and met her eyes. Tifa felt her heart 
&#39;ba-dum, ba-duming&#39; within her chest. She felt her cheeks grow darker 
with blushing. &quot;Why do you not look at me?&quot; Chii asked curiously. Tifa 
was speechless. She did not know what to say. Her mouth grew more dry 
with each second that passed by that she held Chii&#39;s gaze. Finally, 
after about 15 seconds, Tifa pulled her arm away from Chii&#39;s touch and 
she mumbled,
       &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She then moved away from Chii, as if she was 
intimidated by her. Leaving the bar, she went in the back to the 
bathroom. Inside the bathroom, she turned on the water and let it flow 
in front of her as she tried to catch her breath. When she finally did, 
she looked up in the mirror that was hanging above the sink. She was 
quite surprised to see that her face was a deep red. She had beads of 
sweat along her face and she was still breathing harshly. She had no 
idea why. She was shaking. What was it that was coming over her? It was 
like this girl had control over the entirety of Tifa&#39;s body, and she had 
no say in what was happening.
       Running her fingers in the cool water that spilled from the 
faucet tip, she cupped a little bit of the water in her hands, brought 
them up to her face and washed the sweat off with the water. She was 
trying to calm herself down. Trying desperately to control herself, she 
then turned off the faucet and placed her hands on the sides of the 
sink. She convinced herself that Chii&#39;s so-called &#39;control&#39; over her was 
all in her head; that she just missed Cloud and thought Chii would 
replace him in some way. Those thoughts she convinced herself were not 
real. She was just tired. Yes, that was it. She was tired and stressed 
out. She missed Cloud. There were no feelings that existed for this 
Chii-person. Besides, she was straight and in love. Making up her mind, 
she then headed back into the bar to continue working.
       She avoided the bar for a little while, allowing one of the other 
workers to tend to it. But there was this nagging feeling that plagued 
her, begging her to go back to the bar; to Chii. She ignored these 
feelings, continuously telling herself that the feelings were not real. 
They did not exist. They could not exist. Admist her pleas and thoughts 
and hopes, though, Tifa did find herself once or twice gazing back to 
the bar. She caught Chii looking at her, watching her. Chii was not 
drinking too much of her beer; at least not drinking enough to get 
shit-faced drunk like the rest of the idiots plaguing the bar. When Tifa 
saw Chii looking at her, Chii was slowly licking counter-clockwise 
around the rim of the beer bottle and smiling at Tifa. For some strange, 
unknown reason Tifa had to grasp the edge of the table and her breathing 
rate increased ((*teehee* sounds SO porno-cheesy, eh? ^_~)). She felt 
warmness and sexual aching within her vagina. She could not explain why, 
but she suddenly felt so turned on and sexy. When she regained control 
of herself, she looked again at Chii. Chii was not looking in Tifa&#39;s 
direction, however; she was talking to the new bartender. The bartender 
seemed turned on by Chii too, much to Tifa&#39;s disappointment. When Tifa 
realized that she was jealous, she was taken abck.
       /Why?// She thought to herself. /Why should I care?// But she 
did. And there was nothing she could do about it. ((*teehee*)).
       After an hour, Tifa returned to the bar. She was quite surprised 
when she found that Chii had not left; she was still sitting there as 
sexy as always. Only this time, she had had more that one beer. There 
were two empty beer bottles next to her on the bar and one half-empty in 
her hand. Tifa looked at her, a little confused.
       &quot;Why are you still here?&quot; She asked.
       &quot;I&#39;m here for something.&quot; Chii replied simply. &quot;Business.&quot; Tifa 
was curious now.
       &quot;What business?&quot; Chii smiled micheviously; a smile that made Tifa 
feel sexy again.
       &quot;I came for you, Tifa. I want you.&quot; Tifa&#39;s face then flushed. 
Chii giggled lightly, smiling in her success. Within Tifa&#39;s chest, her 
heart was pounding against her ribs. With her mouth devoid of any 
moisture, she choked out,
       &quot;M-- me?!&quot; Chii smiled once more and nodded her head. &quot;Why?&quot;
       &quot;You&#39;re the one I saw first, Tifa.&quot; She replied. Tifa&#39;s cheeks 
burned. Chii placed her beer bottle down on the bar and laughed lightly. 
&quot;I know you like me, Tifa. I can tell. Just let me know when you want to 
make it happen, okay?&quot;
       &quot;Yo-- you mean...?&quot; Her voice was quiet and she was a little 
embarrassed. Chii smiled and nodded her head.
       &quot;Sex, Tifa.&quot;
       &quot;Bu.. but I...&quot; She could not say that she was saving herself 
only for Cloud. It was not because she was embarrassed to admit that she 
was a virgin. It was because she knew that, admist her wanting to be 
with Cloud, she wanted to be with Chii. Her sexual pull towards Chii was 
too great to ignore. She had to have her. And Chii knew this. She could 
read it on Tifa&#39;s face.
       Laughing lightly, Chii said, &quot;You sweet girls are all the same. 
You show all your emotions too easily. I can tell you want to do this, 
Tifa. Let me know...&quot; Then, licking her upper lip in a quick sexy 
manner, Chii then got up and headed towards the bathroom. Tifa 
somewhat-reluctantly watched her go. She watched how Chii&#39;s body swayed 
with such ease and gracefulness despite her having three bottles of 
beer. Tifa&#39;s sexualness had met it&#39;s peak at that moment. Tifa decided 
what she wanted just then. She wanted Chii.
       Tifa left the bar to go follow Chii down to the bathroom, when 
she stopped herself. She saw a picture of her and Cloud hugging, hanging 
on the wall. Cloud was a good friend of the owner of the bar. She had 
been in love with him since they were little. When she saw that picture 
of them together, she instantly stopped and second-guessed her decision. 
Did she really want to do this? She still wanted to save herself for 
Cloud. Why did it even cross her mind to go and sleep with some girl? 
Even if the girl WAS sexy and adorable and seemed to make Tifa&#39;s head 
spin with want and desire...
       Tifa leaned up against the wall and closed her hand around her 
golden locket that Cloud had given her before leaving. She held it and 
closed her eyes. &quot;Give me strength, Cloud.&quot; She said quietly. She then 
went back to work, deciding to turn down Chii&#39;s offer. Indefinately.
