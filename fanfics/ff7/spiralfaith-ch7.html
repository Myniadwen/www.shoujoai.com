Tifa and Yuffie&#146;s Apartment:

     Tifa opens the door and enters.  &#147;Where is she,&#148; says Tifa. Gary 
and Ike point towards the bedroom door, then leave (Pulling a chair 
with them) She runs up to the door and pulls it open. Standing in the 
bedroom, fully naked, is Yuffie.   &#147;Yuffie put some clothes on!&#148; Yells 
Tifa.

     &#147;Hey Tifa am I stupid?&#148; comes from behind the door.

     &#147;Not now&#148; Tifa yells back, &#147;Now Yuffie, put your&#146; clothes on!&#148;

     &#147;Or what&#148; Laughs Yuffie, with a cunning smirk, &#147;are you going to 
ground me?&#148; 

     Then out of nowhere Yuffie&#146;s hand grab Tifa&#146;s left and and pulls 
it to her chest.

     &#147;Yuffie!&#148; Yells Tifa, pulling back and running towards the door.  
She tries to open it, but it won&#146;t budge.  From behind she feels 
Yuffie gab her and start planting kisses on the back of her neck.  
&#147;Yuffie&#148; whimpers Tifa.

     Slowly the kisses turn to hugs, then to caresses, then to kisses 
again.  Finally it ends with gently Tifa turning and dragging Yuffie 
into the bedroom.
     
After Sex:

     &#147;Hey, Yuffie, why did you do it?&#148;

     &#147;Well, after we had a food fight and stuff, .&#148;  &#147;It was just the 
heat of the moment taking over,&#148; Yuffie explains, &#147;and, she is a very 
attractive person you know.&#148;  Tifa nods in agreement, &#147; Tifa, do you 
forgive me?  Are we lovers again?&#148;

     &#147;Yes, of course.&#148;  

     &#147;Tifa, I have another question.&#148;

     &#147;What?&#148;

     &#147;When did you first fall in love with me?&#148;

Three years ago: Orphanage in Hong Kong:

     &#147;Here are the girls,&#148; says the orphanage manager.  &#147; They all 
have very nice personalities&#148; she says, &#147;except her.&#148;  She point to a 
very skinny, and dirty girl.  

     &#147;Hey, who is that, &#145;Tifa asks, pointing at the girl the manager 
didn&#146;t like.

     &#147;Her name?  Yuffie Kisaragi, why?&#148;

     &#147;Hey, Yuffie isn&#146;t it?&#148; Tifa asks, turning her attention to the 
girl.

     &#147;Yeah, what is eh..&#148; She stops when she sees Blue eyes, &#147;Uhh, who 
are you?&#148;

     &#147;I am Tifa&#148; Replies Tifa, &#147;So do you want to live with me?&#148;

     &#147;Sure, why not&#148; she says sarcastically.

     &#147;Okay, then lets go.&#148;

Back in Bed:

     &#147;HEY, Tifa!!&#148;

     &#147;Oh, what?&#148;

     &#147;When did you first fall in love with me?&#148;

     &#147;When we first met.&#148;

Outside of their Apartment:

     Spin walks up to the apartment door (which was held shut by a 
chair) and looks at the two grown men sitting outside (Gary and Ike).  
&#147;Hey, what&#146;s going on?&#148; 

     Gary looks up, &#147;Yuffie and Tifa are fighting.

     &#147;Well I&#146;ll stop it,&#148; she declares moving the chair and going 
inside (Dragging the chair with her).  She walks up to the bedroom 
door and shoves it open.  &#147;What..&#148;

     &#147;Spin, oh ahh.&#148;

     &#147;I hope you two are happy,&#148; Spin cries out, &#147;If you need me I&#146;ll 
be in my favorite place,&#148; she yells running off.  

     Tifa gets ready to chase her but the phone rings. 

     &#147;Hello.&#148;

     &#147;Oh Amber.&#148;

     &#147;She just left&#148;

     &#147;She said she is going to her favorite place&gt;&#148;

     &#147;Maybe the Pizza place!&#148;

     &#147;Okay, I&#146;ll leave it to you..&#148;
