&quot;And it&#39;s not a cry that you hear at night
And it&#39;s not somebody who&#39;s seen the light
It&#39;s a cold and it&#39;s a broken Hallelujah...&quot;

-Jeff Buckley-

------------------------------------

&quot;It doesn&#39;t look like a week on the map!&quot; Yuffie wailed, holding it 
upside down for the curious reason that perhaps the distance would 
magically shorten between here and there, &quot;And worse, it&#39;s been a week 
already, this is what we get for letting Barrett read it!&quot;

&quot;I read I fine, foo&#39;, you&#39;re the one with no direction.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a Ninja! I have plenty of direction, you just don&#39;t know north from 
south from your neighbour&#39;s backyard!&quot;

&quot;Come closer and say that, shrimp.&quot;

&quot;Fine, only because you ASKED FOR MY SHURIKEN UP YOUR ASS!&quot;

Vincent, a quiet spectator in the wonderful world of sport which had 
fast become &#145;Yuffie vs Barrett &#150; insult slinging matches of the 
century!&#39; just lifted a cool, corporate eyebrow and said: &quot;Arguing gets 
you nowhere.&quot;

Tifa covered her face and groaned, &quot;It always starts this way, and soon 
we&#39;ll have to listen to their fighting all night if Vincent can&#39;t 
separate them.&quot;

They were, as Yuffie had stated so acrimoniously, lost. Beyond lost, 
would have been a closer assumption and no amount of blame shifting 
would change the fact that they were lost somewhere around the bottom of 
the Nibel Mountains. For the past week they had followed the directions 
of the map and seemed to have turned in a circle and then like an arrow, 
they had come northward to the mountain feet. This was leaving them in a 
situation that gave pause for grave thinking. Their food supply could 
only be sustained by local wildlife for so long &#150; certain necessities 
were running low besides those of a food nature, and Tifa was sick and 
tired of finding a stream that was chillier than Vincent&#39;s sense of 
humour to bathe in.

Aerith didn&#39;t seem to be entirely too bothered by the situation, sitting 
away from the rest on them on a crop of the mountain rocks and peering 
far away into the distance with a hand raised to shade her brilliant 
eyes, her mouth resting in a hint of a smile as she hummed along to 
songs Tifa only knew from eavesdropping shamelessly. This past week had 
seen Aerith wake three times in the night, shaking with fear and sweat 
dripping off her. Nothing that the fist fighter had said had calmed the 
fluttery heart of the Ancient, no kisses or touches soothed away the 
shakes and when she lay down, her eyes were wide and staring, looking 
somewhere far, far away.

Cloud, seated at the bottom pile of rocks had his head tilted so he in 
turn, like Tifa, was looking at the Ancient who smiled and hummed. The 
dark thorn of jealous wheedled its way into her heart a little deeper 
every time she saw him looking at her. It was ridiculous; Tifa knew 
that, she should be secure in the fact that the object of her affections 
hadn&#39;t rejected her outright. But the again... neither had she voiced 
those three little words that she coveted so dearly.

Sometimes, when she watched Aerith staring in the dark of the tent, 
trying to piece back together the reality she should belong to, Tifa 
wondered if those words would ever be said. It was like catching stars: 
a hopeful dream she clung onto.

Of course, she&#39;d made all kinds of outrageous promises too, like trying 
to fill the life of the Ancient with romance. Romance! What did she know 
about wooing another woman, apart from what she knew she liked herself, 
and that which she had read in novels when growing up, novels of love 
and steamy heady affairs!

The shouting was finally abating after reaching a screeching fever pitch 
and she looked back to see the reason why: Vincent had simply 
transformed into a thing (there was no name for it officially, as he 
reliably had informed the shaken group after the first change over) of 
purple skin and spiked orange hair and was stood between the two 
arguers. They were both eyeing him warily, Yuffie going so far as to 
choke on the words of an apology.

That was better &#150; some peace and quiet at last would do their group some 
good.

After a brief chat over the map, they agreed to let Vincent do the map 
reading and send Red ahead scouting, because his nose seemed far more 
accurate than any of their guesses had been to date. After a cold meal 
of last nights kill-on-the-hoof which again, had been provided by the 
very versatile fire wolf, they all crammed back into the car and for a 
moment, Tifa was glad that she was in the back with both the other girls 
in the company, Cloud and Barrett almost silent together in the front 
with Cait and Vincent poring over the map one seat ahead.

Sometime in the afternoon, she moved the snoring Yuffie so her shoulder 
wasn&#39;t going dead and tilted her head to try and see what it was that 
the Ancient was staring at. But she never once said, and even when Tifa 
tried to talk to her, she was silent like the grave, eyes distant.

Until they were around the campfire, significantly closer to the amazing 
town in the northern plains when she spoke suddenly, startling everyone, 
even Vincent who was normally so taciturn. She said, &quot;It won&#39;t be long 
now.&quot;

Her voice sounded heartbroken.

Tifa didn&#39;t know what she meant and that night, like those nights when 
she didn&#39;t wake crying, she slept like the dead themselves.

------------------------------------------

It won&#39;t be long now.

The words haunted her that next week. She tossed their meaning around in 
her head, trying to figure out what it was that the sometimes reluctant 
flower merchant had meant by that cryptic sentence and just what an 
effect it could have on her life. But Tifa was no philosopher, nor 
versed in theological debate or debate of any kind really. So with 
practical reasoning, she put it aside and let the answer come when it 
would.

Instead, Aerith seemed to try and cheer herself up more than anything. 
The week on the road towards the town was spent with many surprise gifts 
left for the martial artist, in the forms of flower wreaths and daisy 
chains, little kisses when no one was watching and even at one time, she 
pushed Tifa into a lake of water and stood on the shore, laughing. When 
Tifa had angrily asked why she had done that, all the answers had been 
delivered with a quick look down. She still blushed, thinking about her 
poor shirt and the fact she was forced to wear Aerith&#39;s smaller jacket 
to cover the exposure of her skin through the wet and transparent 
material.

So Tifa reciprocated as best as she could, trying out her magic to 
create butterflies of fire to entertain the girl, but that had been 
quickly abandoned after it set Cloud&#39;s hair afire briefly, much to 
varied hoots and shouts anywhere and somewhere between derision and 
anger. She made Aerith&#39;s food extra special as she could make it, in 
fact, always ensured she cooked robust meals for the girl as her health 
seemed to suffer after so long on the road. She spent evenings watching 
the sunset and talking about the poems she loved that she had read and 
memorised, as if only ever for Aerith.

So on the evening approaching the town which they finally saw the 
monstrous structure of the Rocket that defined the northern border town, 
with the dilapidated machinery and structures that tried hard to hold 
the rocket in place from falling over and crushing the buildings and 
lives underneath it, that it came only as a small surprise that Aerith 
requested that they go walking together, under the spread of the night.

They walked close without touching, for Tifa could sense that for this 
night alone, Aerith was never more beyond her crippled grasp of fingers 
and hands stained deeply with blood. She walked with inhuman grace that 
with a heavy heart, the fighter knew she could never match; those 
brilliant eyes fixed high on the distant stars and with bent ear she 
listened to the voice of the Ancient speak.

&quot;Tifa, I wanted to talk... kinda seriously, for a moment.&quot; She smiled, 
looking down at her despite her head tilted backwards a little. It was 
this smile which made her heart jump ten beats and flutter madly in the 
cage of her ribs, her blood running hot and cool all at the same time so 
she didn&#39;t know if she should coolly try and ask why or stay tongue 
tied, hoping... dreading the best, or the worst.

&quot;You know I&#39;m always here to talk to.&quot;

&quot;I was thinking, we&#39;ve come a very long way since Midgar. It&#39;s been 
almost three months now.&quot;

Tifa frowned and counted. True enough, they were hurtling towards the 
Christmas time, the seasons messing themselves all together no matter 
where they went so that she had lost track of time. &quot;You&#39;re right.&quot;

&quot;Three months, and I&#39;ve come so far.&quot; She twirled, skirt flaring, &quot;And 
so far to go. I was a bit scared of you, to start with.&quot;

&quot;Me?&quot; Tifa blinked.

&quot;Of course. You&#39;re all practical, business like. You know where to go, 
what to do, how to plan. You&#39;re organised, I guess you have to be 
though, running a bar.&quot;

&quot;Running a bar isn&#39;t just keeping things organised,&quot; she smiled. &quot;You 
have to remember drink mixes so you don&#39;t look a fool in front of 
customers, leafing through cocktail cards in secret under the counter 
top. You have to know how to deal with drunks or loudmouth idiots or 
people who want to start a bar brawl. Brawl? Fair enough, do it outside 
because repairing the bar costs too much gil!&quot;

Aerith laughed, silver, shivering laugh like stars falling, &quot;So you know 
how to take care of yourself. But really, it worried me. I&#39;m not... I 
mean, I&#39;m rather weak.&quot;

&quot;Not everyone has the same strengths. You do things with materia that 
make me so jealous! I can&#39;t even heal a bruise well enough.&quot; Tifa tucked 
her arms behind her head as she walked in the grass, trying to fight the 
blush from her face as she was overly conscious that her breasts were, 
to put it bluntly, sticking out. But it was Aerith, after all, and she 
knew the Ancient ached for someone to act normal around her. &quot;Don&#39;t give 
up on what you can do. Okay?&quot;

&quot;I know, Teef.&quot; There was a breathless silence and Tifa risked a 
sidelong glance, trying to gauge the moment, but before anything could 
be added, the beautiful cetra continued to speak in her same calm, warm 
tone - it melted everything inside of her, made her feel so accepted and 
wanted that not for the first time, Tifa&#39;s heart fluttered restlessly. 
&quot;Tifa... I&#39;ve been meaning to ask...&quot;

Oh my god.

Tifa swallowed hard, eyeing her as surreptitiously from the side as she 
could. A little voice in her ear taunted that Aerith should see the 
sweat rolling off her!

&quot;...How did Zack look?&quot;

Oh...

Her heart hit the bump in the road and withered out like a flat tyre; so 
she sighed and kicked at a clump of dirt, &quot;Zack? He was alright. Lively 
I guess.&quot;

&quot;If he was hurt then...&quot;

&quot;Probably. I don&#39;t remember, I passed out quickly afterward from blood 
loss myself. Sorry.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right, you have that scar...&quot;

Her hand caressed her breastbone, colour brightening her alabaster skin 
as she realised another set of fingers was reaching over to innocently 
trace the same line of scarring that puckered her flesh in memory of 
that day. The touch was so light that she was shivering by the time that 
the hand was removed. &quot;Aerith,&quot; she said in a strangled voice.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; then the Ancient was blushing too, putting a hand to her 
necklace and moving away, &quot;I just wanted to touch it. I wanted to...&quot;

Wanted to what?

&quot;You&#39;re getting more mysterious by the day,&quot; Tifa laughed, a strained 
laugh, strained through the sieve of her estranged emotions. &quot;But that&#39;s 
okay, its part of who you are, how it all works and fits together, you 
know?&quot;

&quot;Tifa,&quot; The back was to her, the head tilted and once again studying the 
constellations. &quot;One day, they&#39;ll name stars in the sky for us. They&#39;ll 
remember everything we fought hard for, you know? We&#39;ll be heroes! 
They&#39;ll make action figures, they&#39;ll paint pictures and tourist traps of 
everywhere we went, or stopped and slept. And that day, we&#39;ll look back 
and think, &#39;what a wonderful life&#39;, right?&quot;

&quot;Of course we will.&quot;

&quot;Sephiroth... it was so strange. I felt like something in me had changed 
since that time at Costa del Sol, on the boat. I&#39;m not a frightened girl 
anymore. I have to take responsibility. I have to because... because...&quot;

&quot;Rissy, you have become stronger.&quot; Tifa murmured, coming up behind the 
fragile girl to place her arms about her without hesitation and in doing 
so, clasped her closely. &quot;Inside, where no one can see unless you let 
them in.&quot;

&quot;I have?&quot;

&quot;I would place my life in your hands, without second thoughts, love.&quot;

&quot;Teef...&quot;

They remained there, Tifa trying to bury her heavy heart in the scent of 
Aerith&#39;s hair, the scent of summer mornings and flowers which always 
seemed to linger around the green fingered gardener; Aerith in turn 
staring at the far distant stars with her head still tilted but the 
telltale steal of her hand to clasp one of Tifa&#39;s was hard and tight, 
even for such a weak strength that the fighter lifted her brows in 
surprise. She knew that there were more things that the Ancient was 
trying to find the words to say, but none of those words would fit 
together right just yet.

But when the night grew cold and Tifa turned to go, she paused briefly 
to eye the figure of the girl, still stood stock still against the chill 
wind, jacket and dress rippling and her eyes fixed on the distant skies, 
and she could swear she heard her murmur, &quot;Not long at all really...&quot;

------------------------------------------

They made the town the next day, much to Aerith&#39;s squeals of delight, 
running ahead of them all and tilting her head in childlike glee at the 
massive monolith that was an old rocket, tilted to the back of the town 
which had no doubt, sprung up around it some time distant. The logo, 
even at this distance it was readable as ShinRa, indicated that it was 
their property. She paused in her examination of this strange wonder to 
lower her gaze and look back to where Tifa, having also spotted the 
logo, was scowling darkly.

She felt a little sick, to be honest with herself and the Planet.

Last night, all she did was worry and worry: hadn&#39;t she said that she 
was alright with all the consequences that might happen? But looking 
back at the drawn face of Tifa, the sometimes panicked expression of 
Cloud when she stared into the distance, even the frankly worried look 
on the face of Barrett, she knew that she wasn&#39;t ready yet. It wasn&#39;t 
time just yet.

Are you worried?

I am, very worried. I can&#39;t help it, Planet. I can&#39;t help my human 
failings or strengths as I would consider them.

Strengths, child. You combine all that is good of two races.

Child, child... when will I be an adult? I have a name too...

You are a child yet, until otherwise proven. Do not worry; the time is 
some way distant yet. Do not fret; your battle is a simple one that only 
you may achieve. You already know that you must do it alone.

I know but...

Have fun - be aware though, the ones who pursue you are close.

The ShinRa? ...Planet? Planet? Hello, hello?

She gave an aggravated sigh and looked back to where Cloud was running a 
hand into his blond hair and grumbling away to himself, like some old 
man would: &quot;A rusty old rocket, I wonder what they&#39;d make something that 
big for.&quot;

&quot;Show. Clearly.&quot; Vincent&#39;s voice dripped sarcasm, without being raised a 
single wet note above bone dry. Red snorted as Cloud didn&#39;t even respond 
to what had been a purely rhetorical question on his part and started to 
amble into town. Without a word and a shrug of her shoulders, Aerith 
slipped in line, next to Vincent and Yuffie.

&quot;Not a fan of jokes, today. Wonder if he&#39;s grumpy &#145;cause he slept on a 
rock.&quot; Yuffie muttered.

&quot;Yuffie, he&#39;s not grumpy.&quot;

&quot;Of course he isn&#39;t. Bears with sore teeth are more hospitable. Anyway,&quot; 
she lifted a hand, &quot;I&#39;m off to st-er-scout the area. Yes, scout it.&quot;

Vincent coolly arched an eyebrow as the ninja vanished with a bare 
&#39;Aerith-sama&#39; for the Cetra - not a glance sideways for anyone else 
mind. His red eyes travelled to her, as Tifa pulled up alongside. &quot;Is 
she always this...&quot;

&quot;Loud? Annoying? Bratty?&quot; Tifa tried supplying helpfully.

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Guys, give her a break,&quot; the flower girl sighed, &quot;Don&#39;t judge her; you 
don&#39;t even know her that well.&quot;

&quot;To err is human, to forgive... someone else&#39;s job,&quot; Vincent dustily 
murmured. Aerith threw her hands up in abject defeat and followed Cloud 
as he made a beeline for a house that looked as though half a scrap yard 
had decided to nestle in the back garden and around the front flower 
beds: pipes and propellers, even engine bits and tanks strewn all over. 
She eyed the vague thrusting try of flowers in the contaminated dirt as 
Tifa and Barrett, after a quick consultation with her, made for the shop 
to restock. Red and Vincent stopped by her.

The flowers were a pale red with a faint bluish tinge towards the base 
of the petals and on the stamen. She reached out with a hand and 
murmured the threads of magic coming to her hands easily. The murmur, 
she didn&#39;t realise, sounded much like a soft, short melody to those 
listening - as much of the Cetra tongue tended to sound like to human 
ears, pitched differently for the Planet and singsong, to convey 
emotions clearly. The flowers and foliage responded to her encouraging 
caress of magic, from root to the tip of a leaf. They burst forth 
suddenly with new, stronger growth, flowers blooming in a sudden 
flourish of a colour and rage of pollen, sweet scents filling the air.

She studied her handiwork, and then drew back with a pleased expression, 
catching the look of both Vincent and Red. &quot;...what?&quot;

&quot;You really are something,&quot; Red said, shaking his head and licking his 
muzzle, trying to dislodge the pollen gathered there. &quot;You&#39;re always 
handing out.&quot;

&quot;They were struggling. I don&#39;t like to see things suffer,&quot; she replied, 
straightening the bow in her hair. &quot;No one should have to suffer, not 
ever. If my magic helps even just a little, then I&#39;ll use it.&quot;

&quot;The magic though, you realise it is nothing like what Sephiroth lays 
claim to?&quot; Her eyes flickered to Vincent, but his expression gave 
nothing away.

As she tried to consider her answer, the door to the house was thrust 
open and Cloud came out, looking vexed. Vexed would be a mild word for 
those adept as she at reading his facial twitches that often accompanied 
outright irritation and anger. He ran a hand through his hair again, 
definitely agitated about something. It was a moment of silence later 
that he realised he was being stared at. &quot;...There&#39;s a plane, but we 
need permission from some Captain guy.&quot;

&quot;And he is where?&quot; Vincent, thankfully, had changed his focus to Cloud 
with the question and she brushed at her brow without thinking about it 
- he made her feel so strangely on edge!

&quot;He&#39;s in that rocket. It gets worse, ShinRa are coming here.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; she said, voice running away with itself, &quot;The Planet mentioned 
something about pursuers.&quot;

&quot;When!&quot;

&quot;Not long ago... so they must be pretty close.&quot;

&quot;How come the Planet didn&#39;t warn us about the other times?&quot;

Aerith shook her head, all eyes on her, &quot;I don&#39;t know. Sephiroth seems 
to fudge my connection with the Planet, like he&#39;s talking louder than I 
can and all he says is gibberish. That&#39;s the best as I can explain it. 
It seems to frighten the Planet, him talking over me.&quot;

&quot;It would make sense,&quot; Red concurred, at least someone was on her side. 
&quot;Sephiroth and Jenova - the calamity from the skies. The virus that 
infected the people who had come to care for the world... it probably 
cries out with fear because it is afraid you will go too and it will 
have no one left to speak with. Even a Planet is allowed to be lonely.&quot;

&quot;...Does it really ever get lonely? More conjecture,&quot; Vincent rasped, 
&quot;Besides. If ShinRa are coming here, lets go get the plane before they 
do.&quot;

As a group of three they set off towards the rocket: Red, being of four 
legs, stayed behind. He had sharp eyes and could already see that a 
ladder was going to pose him problems on the way up, especially a 
metallic ladder. So in a knot together they walked; Cloud trying to ease 
his anger by talking to Aerith about what new materia she&#39;d like to use 
and Vincent listening, nothing more. It grew to be companionable after 
ten minutes, even Vincent started to add his own advice to the melting 
pot of ideas behind the kind of materia that Aerith, as their main magic 
user, should consider using. It was so, that they approached the rocket 
and stood at the base, talking amongst themselves for a short while. 
Then, with hands on her hips, the flower girl demanded the men go up 
first so none of them would have any reason to peek up her skirt.

Vincent said nothing and went up.

Cloud followed, stammering and very, very red in the face. She noticed 
his hands shook as much as his voice.

Giggling, Aerith followed the two up and to the platform, where hands of 
the ex-Turk helped her to her feet as Cloud seemed to be completely 
overcome by a ravaging fit of shyness. Then, with a gentle poke to his 
ribs that made him squeal, they knocked politely on the half open door 
into the rocket and went inside.

&quot;Hello?&quot; Cloud called.

A man in a strange outfit turned and fixed them all with a glare that 
could have been chiselled from blue ice. His features were strong, but 
with a faint rough, unfinished look to them. His jaw peppered with 
stubble that looked as though he was the sort to need to shave twice a 
day to look remotely tidy. Hair the colour of gold was spiked up and 
swept away by use of a set of pilot goggles where what looked to be a 
packet of cigarettes was jammed. His smile was cocky and sure enough, 
another &#39;smoke&#39; hung out of his mouth, blowing smoke everywhere. He wore 
a pilot&#39;s outfit with a stitch where a logo had been ripped from one 
shoulder. &quot;What&#39;re you guys doing in here?&quot; He demanded.

&quot;We heard the Captain was here.&quot;

He grinned and thumped his chest, &quot;Captain? I&#39;m the Captain! The name&#39;s 
Cid, though everyone just calls me Captain. What dya want?&quot;

Cloud glanced at them and Aerith leaned forward, suggesting gently, &quot;Ask 
about the rocket? He seems pretty into it.&quot;

&quot;Alright,&quot; he shot back, and then cleared his throat to ask, &quot;Tell me 
about this rocket?&quot;

He laughed, &quot;Wow! Not bad for a kid. Alright then, I&#39;ll explain it to 
you. You know Shinra developed a lot of technological gadgets during the 
meaningless war, right?&quot; They all nodded and he swept on, &quot;Now it&#39;s a 
Mako company, but in the old days it was a weapons manufacturer. Well, 
they came up with a Rocket Engine. There was so much experiment about 
the thought of going into outer space. Our dreams got bigger and bigger. 
They put a major budget into it and made prototype after prototype!&quot; He 
gestured at it, proudly, &quot;Finally, they completed Shinra No. 26. They 
chose the best pilot in Shinra-- no, in the world-- me. I mean, come on. 
And finally we get to the day of the launch. Everything was goin&#39; 
well... But, because of that dumb-ass Shera, the launch got messed up.&quot;

He scowled and kicked the side of the rocket, &quot;That&#39;s why they become so 
anal! And so, Shinra nixed their outer space exploration plans. After 
they told me how the future was Space Exploration and got my damn hopes 
up... DAMN THEM! Then, it was all over once they found out Mako energy 
was profitable. They didn&#39;t even so much as look at space exploration. 
Money, moola, dinero! My dream was just a financial number for them! 
Look at this rusted Rocket. I was supposed to be the first man in space 
with this. Everyday, it tilts a little bit more. At this rate, I don&#39;t 
know which will come first, this thing falling down or me gettin&#39; outta 
here. My last hope is to talk to the President...&quot;

With a sigh, Cid turned from them and cupped his face over with a hand.

Aerith tugged on Cloud&#39;s sleeve just as he opened his mouth, and then 
winced as he went right on: much like an inevitable stream just rolling 
downhill. Unstoppable. &quot;Is Rufus coming?&quot;

Cid peered blearily over his shoulder, &quot;Yeah, it must be the news about 
restarting the Space Programme. A young President, That&#39;s what we 
needed. He has dreams too, still!&quot;

Cloud looked like he had eaten something sour, Aerith glancing at 
Vincent who showed no emotion. She turned her face away because she 
honestly felt the same, and sorry for Cid, stuck here with his dreams 
all dust. Cloud continued: &quot;Can we borrow the Tiny Bronco?&quot;

&quot;What the fuck? You outta your mind? That&#39;s my most cherished 
possession; I can&#39;t let you take it.&quot; He shook his head and turned back 
to what he was working on.

Cloud made to try and say something else, clearly unsatisfied with the 
answer but Vincent stepped in and hauled him away. Aerith followed the 
two, despite a formless growl of choked frustration from Cloud&#39;s throat. 
&quot;Don&#39;t, Strife,&quot; suggested the cold man.

&quot;We need that plane.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s alright Cloud,&quot; she soothed, along with Vincent, honey tones to 
his ice clad ones, &quot;We&#39;ll figure something out. We always do, right?&quot;

Even so, she couldn&#39;t help that bite of despair either...

---------------------------------------

Tifa came into the house, pocketing a materia slyly and then blinking at 
the sight of Aerith, Cloud, Red and Vincent all squashed around a table, 
staring at the figure of a fat man who jumped around the sink and a 
mousy looking woman in a lab coat. &quot;Uh?&quot;

&quot;Tifa, you took your time.&quot; Cloud muttered. &quot;Come and have some tea.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s really good,&quot; Aerith added, offering the very same cup she&#39;d been 
drinking from, so sweetly that there was no way unless hell froze over 
and didn&#39;t inform her about it, that she could refuse. So she slid 
across and crouched down by Aerith&#39;s chair, taking the cup with numb 
fingers from the chill of winter.

Sipping it - it was fantastic tea! - She peered at the fat man. Then 
with a fumble she almost dropped the cup, standing upright with a tea 
soaked hand and a throbbing pain on her thigh from where she scalded the 
skin in her haste. &quot;That&#39;s ShinRa&#39;s Palmer,&quot; she hissed, rounding on 
Cloud. &quot;What&#39;s he doing here?&quot;

&quot;Restarting the space programme, supposedly.&quot;

&quot;Space programme? Oh, don&#39;t tell me. I&#39;ll find out eventually... but...&quot; 
she paused, hearing a ruckus from the front and as one, Avalanche new 
and old, surged to the window, the other members coming out of the 
sitting room where they&#39;d been playing cards to pass the time (Yuffie 
had been cheating Barrett from his money outrageously again, despite 
Cait&#39;s cheery warnings otherwise).

Through the windows, they could see the figure of the pilot arguing with 
no one other than the &#39;strawberry blond&#39; President Rufus. Ginger, Tifa 
candidly admitted, he was ginger in denial. She leaned close to the 
window, pressing on the nondescript curtains to try and hear what was 
being said between the two who argued so voraciously.

&quot;What the... you... got me all excited for nothing!&quot; The pilot seemed 
beyond furious, his face escalating from red to purple. &quot;Then what&#39;d ya 
come here for!&quot;

Rufus flicked casually at his hair then studied his nails, eyeing the 
captain over them slyly, &quot;I want to borrow the Tiny Bronco. We&#39;re going 
after Sephiroth. But seems like we&#39;ve been going in the wrong direction. 
But now, we think we know where he&#39;s headed. But, we have to cross the 
ocean. That&#39;s why we want your plane...&quot;

This only served to make the Captain angrier and he spat, literally, 
spat a huge globule of something that Tifa most certainly didn&#39;t want to 
try and identify towards the President: &quot;Fuck! First the Airship, then 
the Rocket, and now, the Tiny Bronco. Shinra took outer space away from 
me and now you want to take the sky away from me too!&quot;

&quot;Oh my... You seem to forget it was because of Shinra, Inc. that you 
were able to fly in the first place.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

A touch on her shoulder made her turn around, to see the back door 
shutting. Shera was stood shyly behind them, leaving the raging of the 
two men outside to its own devices. The assistant, definitely mousy and 
completely shy in her posture, looked at them, and then seemed to settle 
on looking at Aerith, someone she likely deemed as the least threatening 
of their group - assured too by the sweet and warm smile that made 
people so attached to the girl. &quot;Um... excuse me? You wanted to use the 
Tiny Bronco? I believe Palmer&#39;s going to take it... why don&#39;t you 
talk... ah!&quot;

Before she could finish, they were all hurrying out into the backyard 
where Palmer was stood before the plane, eyeing it up and tilting his 
head, jowls wobbling. Cait closed the door behind him, to try and shield 
Shera&#39;s eyes from any incipient violence. Tifa wished she could bundle 
Aerith inside to do the same - but knew such an action would be 
completely useless against an expert materia user... not to mention 
escape artist when faced with the Turks...

Palmer was whining to himself in a tone that seemed to just set her 
teeth to grinding, as she checked the straps of her heavily armoured 
gauntlets, &quot;Hmmm... why do I have to do this...? I&#39;m the head of the 
Space Programme!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll be taking that Tiny Bronco.&quot;

Palmer turned slowly around, gulping slowly, his eyes as large as his 
belly in his face, showing white all around the iris. &quot;I&#39;ve seen you 
somewhere before... I know! The Shinra building! When the President was 
killed! Ulp! Se... se... security!&quot;

The gun moved from that jacket quicker than Tifa would have given it 
credit and the first blow took Barrett completely by surprise, knocking 
him backwards and out over the fence, white picket, which surrounded the 
large back yard. Everything seemed to flow together, her pulse picking 
up as it often did during any battle.

Cloud charged in, swinging his sword wide, the fat man dancing aside 
with shocking nimbleness so he went slicing with a furrow through the 
ground and to the other side of him. This gave Tifa just enough 
opportunity to rush him from the easterly side, her foot ploughing into 
his back with force: this pushed him from his feet and over Red who 
barrelled into his legs. He went down with the resounding of a tonne of 
bricks. On the sidelines, quick as she could, Aerith murmured the words 
for the spell to protect them - a raised aura that glowed blue on her 
skin alerting her to the fact that the spell had taken hold on at least 
three of them.

Palmer fired off several more shots. Tifa dodged two, but one struck 
Yuffie hard in the thigh. She screamed out in pain and went down, 
shuriken tumbling end over end to get in the way at least of another 
bullet that had been zinging through the air for Red. As the fire wolf 
yelped and dove from the way, Vincent swooped down, tucked Yuffie under 
an arm and dodged back from the fight whilst firing off three rounds of 
his own. Only one hit the dancing mark, in the vast expanse of his 
backside which he was mockingly flashing. Palmer yowled in agony and 
waved his hands.

Tifa was thrown back by the wall of flame that made the ground under her 
feet hot suddenly and with a panic rising, she was suddenly unable to 
move. Fire... everywhere there was fire... It burned in her brain...

She was lost.

As she stumbled away, holding her chest, Barrett was up and firing back 
at Palmer, enough to throw him off balance for Aerith&#39;s hold spell to 
take effect. Cait rushed in, taking several bullet holes to his stuffed 
body and with a heavy hit, knocked Palmer back from his feet and into 
the oncoming thwack of Cloud&#39;s large sword, sending him flying onto the 
dirt path, gun knocked away from his hand and lying redundant.

Dimly, she heard a screech of tyres and the sobbing of Yuffie as Vincent 
grated out the need for medical assistance. But as Aerith got close, she 
pointed in horror. &quot;Look, its going!&quot;

Sure enough, the Tiny Bronco was stuttering along the ground with little 
hops, the propeller working just fine. Tifa gawked, the fear of the 
flames fading quickly as she flashed a glance to the others. Cloud, torn 
for a moment, snarled and yelled, &quot;No time for medics, get on, 
everyone!&quot;

Tifa dashed to take a hold of Red, seeing as he didn&#39;t even have hands 
to help him onto the plane wing and with help from Cait&#39;s strength, they 
bundled the disgruntled fire wolf aboard. He promised many an evil death 
for such a careless act which had first left him in an undignified 
position on his back, sprawled helplessly. Tifa crawled up, as did Cloud 
who hurried made room for Yuffie and Vincent. Vincent, showing 
surprising knowledge - or perhaps not so surprising with knowledge of 
his past profession - took the pilot&#39;s seat and started to steer the 
aimless plane that was trying to mow down the fence. Aerith hurried 
across and with Barrett, they both grabbed onto the plane. Cait gave the 
flower girl a boost, and then hung his mostly weightless body on the 
tail.

Then, before they knew it, it was away and going. It stuttered quite a 
few times, but when it was airborne, it was an experience that Tifa 
revelled in. She glanced across to where Aerith was and saw wonder 
etched into her glorious, shining features and with delight, smiled when 
she was graced with a smile in turn. Then, she was forced to grab onto 
the moulding as the plane veered sharply to the right.

&quot;Let&#39;s get that pilot,&quot; shouted Barrett.

&quot;...&quot; The ex-Turk swung the plane around and it swooped down over the 
town; enough to see the ShinRa employees staring up and the face of the 
President, taut with tension and anger. The Pilot, Cid, was staring up 
with amusement and as the plane scooped past, Cloud reached down and 
grabbed his hand, hauling him on.

But nothing is ever plane-sailing, Tifa thought, minding the pun...

The shouts of the President caught the wind and she called for them to 
duck not one moment too soon as shots rang out all around them. They 
couldn&#39;t hit a barn door at ten paces, normally... but one soldier, on 
this one occasion, got very lucky and hit the tail of the plane. Tifa 
yelled out for Cait to try and douse the flames but they were falling, 
into the far distant water with the cries of emergency landing from 
Cid...

Then they crashed into the water, and it all went dark.

-------------------------------------

Water...?

Water!

She struggled violently: it felt as she would never breathe again, she 
would fall down, or maybe fly away and be lost. Be lost forever to the 
eyes of those she loved, the world she loved, the life she loved with a 
passion. She flailed at the water, trying to drag leaden limbs into the 
water when she cast her frightened eyes to the side and saw the equally 
leaden figure of Tifa sinking quickly. She was limp and her hair floated 
in a ghastly net.

Teef! Teef, no!

Struggling on, she would struggle on, like her beloved flowers: she 
would try.

With awkward strokes and dying lungs, she caught the fingers of the 
fighter after a precarious few moments and turned her to see the slack, 
unmoving face of the fighter. She knew in that moment, that Tifa was 
drowning and would die if she didn&#39;t do anything. So she clasped the 
hand harder and pointed down below her, hoping her insane idea would 
work.

Planet. Aid me!

The wind was born.

It had never been borne in the water before, the water was a stranger to 
its airy ways, but soon it bubbled, quickly bubbled up and up until it 
caught the two dying girls and with a great whoosh of air, ejected them 
to the surface, somewhere very close to the shore. With a gasp she 
couldn&#39;t contain, Aerith sucked air in greedily and glanced about wildly 
for any sign of the plane, but there was nothing, only purple-black 
water in the moonless night, the stars and the shore which she pulled 
the deadweight Tifa towards. After a hard slog, she pulled Tifa onto the 
shore and collapsed on her knees beside her.

She isn&#39;t breathing.

Like she had seen a man do at the beach at Costa del Sol, she leaned 
over the limp body of the fighter and pressed her ear to the still 
chest. Then unlike the man, she spun the magic from her curative materia 
as deftly as someone would write a poem, bake a cake, laugh... It was 
all the same as breathing to Aerith. Then, dripping hair and sniffles 
from the cold water aside, she leaned over and tilted Tifa&#39;s head back 
to clear the airway and with a slight breath, blew into her lungs whilst 
pressing her magic down above the breastbone. It seemed to take an 
eternity, and in all honesty, kissing Tifa to give her life wasn&#39;t all 
that much of a chore... not a chore at all, to be fair...

Then Tifa was coughing and Aerith helped turn her on her side, rubbing 
encouragingly to get the water out of her lungs. With a deft flick of 
her hand, she summoned the will to burn fire in the very sand without 
fuel, sustaining it on her spirit alone and directed it so it rested 
close by the shivering, coughing martial artist.

&quot;Rissy?&quot; Tifa cried weakly.

And with a relived smile, she brushed hair from the pale face, &quot;Right 
here.&quot;

&quot;Where is everyone else? Why do my lungs hurt?&quot;

The memory was fuzzy, but she knew the plane had crashed into the water, 
likely stunning the two girls - but the fear of drowning in the water 
from that dream had galvanised Aerith into waking action, whereas Tifa 
had just lay there limp. She related this in calm tones, adding, 
&quot;Because you were dying.&quot;

&quot;Dying?&quot;

&quot;Drowning... you weren&#39;t awake. The natural reflex is to breathe and 
when you&#39;ve been stunned, instinct overrides reasonable thought. Your 
body doesn&#39;t tell you &#39;I might drown&#39;, you simply do the most natural 
thing and that is to breathe. I&#39;m just glad I wasn&#39;t tired enough that I 
could swim and get you.&quot;

Then Tifa was laughing, laughing in the way of someone gripped by 
hysterics. &quot;My hero!&quot;

&quot;Hero?&quot; Aerith went a shade of red, &quot;Stop teasing and get dry. I&#39;m going 
to look for the plane, so stay here, alright?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll go-&quot;

&quot;No, you almost drowned.&quot; Aerith stood up, &quot;For me, stay and rest, 
please?&quot;

The wine dark eyes pleaded silently, but she firmed her jaw in response 
until Tifa sighed and lay back down in the wet sand, arms above her 
head, &quot;Fine. I can never win against you anyway. Love must mean learning 
to lose an argument once in a while. Don&#39;t be long...&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t be. I&#39;ll be back.&quot;

She started down the line of the beach, hair whipping in the chill winds 
of the night and some way along, she glanced back at Tifa and her fire, 
the glow on the face of sorrow&#39;s beauty and her heart clenched 
helplessly, a spasm in her chest with inexplicable fear. And sadly, she 
touched her necklace and murmured as tears slid down her cheeks, &quot;Its 
close. So it won&#39;t be long at all, Teef. Not long at all, really...&quot;

...and weeping, like the haunted ghost, she wandered alone under the 
stars in search of others...</pre>
