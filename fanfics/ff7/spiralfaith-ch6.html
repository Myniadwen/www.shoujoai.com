(Sunday, May 12)  Green Army Base:

      Spin walked up to the front desk, where Lucca and Marle worked.  
&#147;Hey, we got any new info?&#148;

     &#147;Oh hi Spin&#148; Lucca replied.

     &#147;Yeah, hi what ever,&#148; Spin yells loudly, &#147;any info.&#148;

     &#147;No,&#146; Says Marle, &#147;Oh and we know about you and Amber breaking 
up.&#148;

     &#147;And we are sorry, and surprised.&#148;

     &quot;Really&#148; Spin says in a psychotic manner. Then she hits their box 
of donuts, throwing hem everywhere, &#147;You feel sorry for your stupid 
donuts?&#148;  &#147;Son of a Bitch!&#148;  As she reaches the center of the room, 
she reaches into one of the many cubicles and grabs a vase, then 
throws it into the ground, shattering it instantly.    She then walks 
up to a wall, punches it, and then heads off to their room.

     Tifa runs in to the building.  &#147;Hey what happened here?&#148;

     &#147;Spin&#148; the two answered simultaneously.  

     &#147;Oh, sorry.&#148;  Then she runs and apologizes to the person in the 
cubical.  She stops to admire Spin&#146;s hole in the wall then continues 
to their office.

The office:

     &#147;Tifa, why?&#148; ask Spin as Tifa enters the room.

     &#147;Why what?&#148; Tifa replies, knowing the answer.

     &#147;Why did they cheat on us?&#148;  &#147;Why did she cheat on me?&#148; Tifa 
grabs Spin and pulls her into tight embrace.  &#147;I can&#146;t remember 
anything before I met her&#148; Spin cries into Tifa&#146;s chest.

     &#147;It just seems like that, but you&#146;ll forget, eventually&#148; Tifa 
reassures.

     &#147;No, I don&#146;t want to forget,&#148; she whines, &#147; I don&#146;t want to 
forget.&#148;

     &#147;Oh, Spin.&#146;  Tifa hugs her tighter, &#147;It will all be okay.&#148; 
Suddenly she feels something touch her neck, then it moves a little to 
the side.  She looks down to find Spin planting kisses everywhere on 
her.  &#147;What are you doing?&#148;

     &#147;I need someone to love me, please,&#148; Spin weeps between kisses.  
&#147;I can&#146;t live without love.&#148;

Love me&#133;  hold me&#133; I need some one to love&#133; Please be it&#133;
     
__________________________________________________________________

     &#147;Well, I think I love you.&#148;

     &#147;You love me?&#148;

     &#147;Yes&#148;

     &#147;  (Laugh) Are you kidding.&#148;  &#147;Like I&#146;d ever love you,  (Laugh) 
you homeless freak!&#148; 
     
__________________________________________________________________

     &#147;Spin are you okay?&#148;

     &#147;Will you love me?&#148; Spin asks, tears overtaking her eyes.

     &#147;Yes, but lets take it one step at a time,&#148; Tifa explains, &#147;Date 
first, sex second.&#148;

     &#147;Okay&#148; Spin sighs, &#147;Thank you Tifa.&#148;

     Tifa looks down, &#147;For what?&#148;

     &#147;For loving me,&#148; explains Spin.

Amber&#146;s Apartment:

     She sat there and cried.  She cried all night and day.  She cried 
hold a picture of Spin in her hands.  &#147;No,.. Spin,. I am Sorry.&#148;  She 
looks over at a pink sweater that Spin had given her last year on her 
birthday.  (Never liked that sweater til&#146; now)

Ambers Birthday: one year ago:

     &#147;Okay open it&#148; Spin instructed.

     &#147;Okay&#148; Amber said, opening her present.  After the wrapping was 
gone all that was left between her and her gift would be a white box. 

     &#147;I hope you like it.&#148; 

     &#147;I am sure I will,&#148; said Amber, removing the box lid to reveal a 
pink sweater that would be quite tight on her.  &#147;Oh, thanks,&#148; (Never 
liked pink, &#147;I&#146;ll cherish it.&#148;

Amber&#146;s Apartment:

     &#147;Spin.&#148;

Back at the Base:

     &#147;Who is watching Yuffie?&#148; asked Spin as she hugs Tifa (whom is in 
her lap).

     &#147;Gary and Ike are watching her for free.&#148;  Tifa&#146;s beeper goes off 
in the middle of their cuddling time.

     &#147;Who is it?&#148; Ask Spin.

     &#147;Gary and Ike, wait a sec.&#148;  Pick up the phone and dials their 
cell number.

     &#147;Hey, Gary?&#148;

     &#147;What is it?&#148;

     &#147; She is doing what?&#148;

     &#147;Okay I&#146;ll be right there&#148;

     &#147;What is it&#148; Spin asks curiously.

     &#147;Yuffie is being a pain, BRB.&#148;

     &#147;I&#146;ll go along for the ride.&#148;

Bravery-

Bravery,

Is it an emotion,

Or is it really fear reflected.

Being brave is not being fearless,

It is the ability to face your fears.
