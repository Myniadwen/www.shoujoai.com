<h1>Vagrants Rhapsody (part 23 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/pnkpanther9.html">PnkPanther9</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff7/vagrhap-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>Technical phrases were just that-technical. Uselessly excessive and 
pompous, the speech of political savvy dripped thick like slime into her 
ear canals. If there was one thing that Yuffie agreed with Barret on, it 
was her dislike of politics and the entrapping mind games it played. It 
perhaps bothered her even more so, as it was a constant element of her 
life, as welcome as any debauched sibling. It turned her stomach to see 
her father practice the hated art, the lashes of his tongue quick and 
sharp like a whip.

It was her birthright, she supposed. To lead from a chair and face the 
pasty complexions of grotesque

politicians was the fate of every true leader, as far as she knew. 
Yuffie could feel it all ready-the creep and crawl of the dusty old 
codgers gazes-judging, speculating, scheming-their dry lips and yellow 
teeth restraining truth and hissing poison. Yuffie&#39;s back tensed and her 
nostrils flared whenever the thought came to her-the reality was a cold 
shamble, a chilling parallel that saw her father&#39;s throne of power as a 
cripple&#39;s wheelchair.

Trapped in that place, disputes could no longer be settled through her 
fists, no longer settled through a direct insult and outright threats. 
It was all to be specifically unspecific the moment Yuffie took her 
father&#39;s place, and she felt it demeaning to know that her reality would 
soon be regaled to the games of men aged older than her great 
grandmother&#39;s favorite bottle of sake. The urge to vomit was waylaid 
only by her desire to see Wutai through to its true potential. She was a 
nationalist at heart, after all.

&quot;Elroy&#39;s scheme to play to left-wing activists is only going to lead to 
extreme anarchism throughout the globe! We&#39;ve got enough on our plate 
dealing with over-zealous corporations cannibalizing Shinra&#39;s remains, 
we don&#39;t need terrorism to be tossed into the mix!&quot;

&quot;Mason, you&#39;re getting melodramatic. Just because the commissioner 
agrees with some left-wing ideas, that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s pandering to 
them!&quot;

&quot;Then what would you call nearly one million dollars worth of 
contribution money to the Spencer Wings? A KNOWN eco-terrorist group I 
might add...&quot;

Roland flicked a bread crumb into his glass of water. Yuffie quietly 
applauded him. Neither Tifa or Mason took notice.

Sighing, the ninja leaned back in her wooden chair and took to staring 
at the rafters overhead. They were large and bulky, the wood striped in 
natural lines of age. In a corner, the girl thought she saw a cobweb. 
Stiffly she stared to see if anything moved, but after a moment, she 
came to relax, thinking wryly, &quot;That was the most exciting moment I&#39;ve 
had so far.&quot;

Two hours prior, Yuffie had taken Roland&#39;s offhand remark about Tifa and 
Mason lightly, thinking it was simply an attempt at dry humor. At 
returning to their table back in the restaurant, however, she quickly 
came to discover that-not only had Tifa and Mason made the baffling 
switch from food to the dreaded topic of politics-they had somehow 
managed to ignite a debate across the entire room; it was an event which 
led to a portly man attempting to shank a frail-limbed waiter with his 
soup spoon, and a horse-faced woman to sing an old marching song in 
unabashed volumes when an old bitter Shinra military veteran deprecated 
the name of a certain famous war general by the name of Hoss Krinkle.

At first, this greatly entertained Yuffie, and she and Roland quietly 
watched the events unfold with growing amusement and disbelief. But when 
the restaurant manager came bustling in with his arms flapping and face 
turned pink, things were quickly broken up. The portly man with the soup 
spoon was brusquely frog marched to the restaurant&#39;s front lobby where 
he was later arrested by authorities; the waiter was taken to the 
hospital for major scrape wounds to the chest and face; the surly Shinra 
veteran was asked anxiously if he could leave the premises; and the 
horse-faced woman was told curtly to, &quot;Put a sock in it,&quot; as she made it 
a point to sing while all of the above occurred. Finally, the manager, 
harried and unhappy, came to Tifa and Mason, his long face glistening 
with sweat as he asked them with a strained voice to keep their 
discussion quiet and respectful of the other guests.

After that, the following hour and a half turned to a slow crawling 
torture.

With thoughts of freedom in mind, Yuffie spoke, taking a brief moment 
only to clear her throat. &quot;Hey, uh, as fascinating as this whole 
conversation is-y&#39;know, about greedy bald-headed mayors, economic 
no-no&#39;s, and the yucky bit of trouble our global commissiony guy stepped 
into...don&#39;t you think we oughta get going? We&#39;ve kinda hit the two hour 
mark. I, y&#39;know, don&#39;t want anybody gettin&#39; into trouble on our 
account.&quot; Yuffie, who had cut her napkin into perfect tessellations of 
ninja stars using her steak knife, stared balefully at Tifa next to her, 
her body slouched deep into her seat. Roland fared only slightly better, 
as he took to evenly spreading the sauce of his recently devoured meat 
in a perfect sheet across his plate with his spoon. He looked up 
brightly at Yuffie, who glanced at him with a shared feeling of 
hopefulness.

Tifa, the trance of political melodrama falling from her eyes like a 
house of cards, blinked at Yuffie, whose question seemed to linger in 
the silence. &quot;I&#39;m sorry?&quot; she said blankly.

Next to her, Mason glanced quickly at his watch. &quot;Oh,&quot; he murmured under 
his breath. He looked up at everyone at the table, his face dropping 
from it&#39;s state of intellectual frustration. &quot;Ms. Kisaragi&#39;s right, I 
have to go.&quot; He stood quickly, his hand sweeping once through his hair 
in a fluid motion. &quot;Time went by so fast, I didn&#39;t even realize...&quot; 
Mason patted his coat, procuring a sleek cell phone from

within his pocket. He flipped it open briskly, and his face paled.

As he did this, Roland bolted upright, his eyes turned wide, &quot;Mason! Oh, 
Shiva, I&#39;m sorry I forgot! I should have said something earlier!&quot; His 
worry wrinkle was once again present on his brow as he looked up at his 
partner.

Mason shook his head as he pulled his chair back towards the table. His 
face had begun to perspire. &quot;No, no, it&#39;s fine. I&#39;ve just...I&#39;ve got to 
call them and get going or...&quot; he looked at Tifa and Yuffie with thin 
lips and a clenched jaw. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for just leaving so suddenly. I hope 
we get to see you again

before you leave Costa Del Sol. If you&#39;ll excuse me...&quot; and without 
another word, he hurried away from the table and out of the restaurant.

Yuffie and Tifa stared after him, their eyes wide and blank.

&quot;I didn&#39;t think that would actually work!&quot; Yuffie breathed wondrously to 
herself.

&quot;Did we get him in trouble?&quot; Tifa wondered worriedly.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry about him,&quot; Both women turned to look back at Roland, 
who gazed after his lover with gently furrowed brows and intent eyes. 
The man continued as he turned to look at them both, &quot;Mason just forgot 
about an appointment for work...&quot;

Tifa leaned forward and asked in a low voice, &quot;Is it really all right? 
He seemed really shaken.&quot;

Roland shook his head emphatically, a shaky laugh spilling from his 
lips. &quot;No, no. It&#39;s nothing for

you to worry about.&quot; He raised a hand, catching the attention of a 
nearby waiter.

&quot;Ah, waiter? Check please.&quot;

----------

&quot;Do bartenders normally get that bugged?&quot; Yuffie wondered aloud as she 
and Tifa sat waiting at a stop light. They had left a harried Roland at 
his store after returning from the restaurant. His haste and anxiety 
left virtually no room for further conversation, so the girls were left 
with an abrupt departure and a sneaking feeling of guilt. Now they drove 
back in the direction of the hotel, the day free to them to do as they 
pleased.

&quot;It depends. He could&#39;ve been handling business for his bar...&quot; Doubt 
managed to creep into Tifa&#39;s answer.

Yuffie didn&#39;t miss it. &quot;Well...maybe he&#39;s not a bartender, but a teacher 
instead?&quot;

Tifa raised an eyebrow and rested her chin on Yuffie&#39;s shoulder, so that 
she could gaze sidelong into the ninja&#39;s face. &quot;What makes you say 
that?&quot; she asked.

Yuffie shrugged her other shoulder, &quot;He&#39;s really smart. And I don&#39;t mean 
&#39;Nanaki&#39; kinda smart, too. I mean like, &#39;I went to school and studied 
forever just to teach others&#39; kinda smart. The way he talked about 
Shinra, Reeve, and all these crazy political factions we&#39;ve got going 
now was a bit more intimate than your average person would know.&quot;

Tifa frowned as her eyes turned glassy with thought. &quot;That&#39;s right, 
isn&#39;t it?&quot; she said eventually, leaning back with a deepening frown. &quot;He 
did seem to know a lot about odd things...Like the remark about the 
Spencer Wings! I&#39;ve heard of them, but as far as I know, no paper has 
reported anything about a million dollar endorsement.&quot; the woman paused. 
&quot;...Then again, I haven&#39;t read the paper since I left Tiesmire...&quot;

&quot;But still, don&#39;t you think he&#39;s sort of...unique?&quot; The light turned 
green. Yuffie accelerated the bike and they once again found themselves 
sailing along the street.

&quot;He&#39;s definitely above average.&quot;

Yuffie turned her head briefly to offer Tifa a skeptical look. &quot;Eh? 
What? You think he&#39;s cute?&quot;

Tifa gave her a chiding look. &quot;Who said that?&quot;

Yuffie turned her head forward. She smirked as she said, &quot;Well, gee, I 
dunno...you called him, &#39;above average&#39;.&quot;

The woman quirked an eyebrow as she spoke. &quot;And saying &#39;above average&#39; 
automatically means I&#39;m calling him &#39;cute?&#39;&quot;

&quot;Nowadays, yeah.&quot; Yuffie grinned surreptitiously.

&quot;You calling me old?&quot;

&quot;I all ready said you weren&#39;t old, Rusty. Remember?&quot;

&quot;You oughta watch what you tell a girl, Yuffie. Some women don&#39;t like 
being reminded of their age...&quot;

&quot;But I never called you old!&quot;

&quot;And what was with the &#39;nowadays&#39; remark?&quot;

&quot;Hey country girl, don&#39;t get so huffy! Sheesh, I was just trying to let 
you in on things...y&#39;know...since you&#39;re a hermit.&quot; Yuffie couldn&#39;t help 
but snicker the last part.

Tifa poked Yuffie&#39;s back in retaliation, her cheeks rosy. &quot;Says the girl 
who thinks &#39;spanktastic&#39; is a word.&quot; she returned sorely.

&quot;So anyways...&quot; Yuffie continued idly, &quot;Roland was...y&#39;know, nice. Maybe 
a bit infected with that sage-like mumbo jumbo that Bugenhagen always 
used to spout...but still nice.&quot;

Tifa smiled, &quot;Did he offer you words of wisdom too?&quot;

Yuffie grinned sheepishly, &quot;Yep.&quot;

&quot;Paternal, isn&#39;t he?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. And fatherly, too.&quot;

Tifa smiled widely and her eyes suddenly turned sharp. It was Yuffie&#39;s 
turn to have pink cheeks. &quot;Yuffie, that&#39;s kinda the same thing.&quot; the 
woman corrected slyly.

The girl tensed as her cheeks did just as Tifa hoped they would. 
&quot;Really?&quot; she asked the confidence in her voice thrown off by a 
questioning rise in pitch.

Tifa nodded as her arms hugged Yuffie&#39;s body more tightly. She reveled 
in their conversational games. As she brushed her cheek against the 
ninja&#39;s, she gave a shiver, and said with quiet earnest, &quot;That&#39;s fine. I 
don&#39;t really care.&quot;

Yuffie sighed, her pride still wounded. &quot;I&#39;m buying a dictionary.&quot; she 
grumbled sourly.

At this remark, the fighter couldn&#39;t help but giggle, and-as if to make 
up for this-she nibbled at the girl&#39;s ear, her tongue tracing along the 
ear&#39;s ridge.

The ninja&#39;s surly embarrassment evaporated as her back arched and her 
eyes widened. Instinctively, only her right shoulder rose and her left 
hand pulled down in a sudden motion. If standing, the girl would have 
turned to face the sudden surprise-but on her bike, the ninja only 
shifted in her seat and turned the bike&#39;s handle bars. An action that 
led them into oncoming traffic. It was a cursory glance forward that 
allowed Tifa to realize the danger headed for them.

As she pulled back from Yuffie, the woman pointed and screamed, &quot;Look 
out!&quot;

The warning jostled Yuffie out of her momentary lapse of attention-just 
soon enough to see the grill of the car headed straight for them. Her 
face turned ashen with horror as the ninja turned the handle bars and 
leaned to the right, her body twisted and stiffened from shock as she 
regarded the other car on its way past them.

A sharp, quick, sound tore through the warm air, and before a single 
thought could be registered, things were still again.

&quot;Note to self: never nibble Yuffie&#39;s ear while she&#39;s driving.&quot;

&quot;It just surprised me! All of a sudden I felt this warm, wet thing on my 
left ear and...and...&quot;

&quot;I thought I was going to die!&quot;

&quot;...Y&#39;know, that actually felt pretty...&quot;

&quot;Look! Look! My hands won&#39;t quit shaking! I&#39;ve got goosebumps all over!&quot;

&quot;...Ah, d&#39;ya think you could do that...y&#39;know, again?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve felt this shaken up 
since...since...well...actually...it hasn&#39;t been that long ago.&quot;

&quot;Uh, Tifa?&quot;

&quot;I mean, there was that stupid tournament in Gold Saucer, the mess with 
the chocobos in the forest, and...y&#39;know, yesterday.&quot;

&quot;Tifa?&quot;

&quot;But SHIVA, I could&#39;ve died this time!&quot;

In the parking lot to an outdoor shopping mall, Yuffie stared across at 
Tifa who stood rigidly three feet away from her. Between them stood 
Yuffie&#39;s bike, Deevo, it&#39;s left side-view mirror bent at a slightly 
different angle than it&#39;s twin.

Yuffie placed her hands high on her hips as she regarded the fighter 
with a scathing look. &quot;Rusty, you could&#39;ve died, like, hundreds of times 
in your lifetime, remember?&quot; She pointed at the fighter with an arched 
eyebrow, &quot;You crashed a plane once While being SHOT at!&quot;

Tifa shook her head and crossed her arms high over her chest, so that 
her shirt bunched. &quot;Well...it doesn&#39;t matter how many times you come 
close to dying. It still isn&#39;t fun, is it?&quot;

Yuffie leaned forward and waved a hand energetically toward the street 
they had just turned off. &quot;But I didn&#39;t hit him!&quot;

&quot;And what do you think happened to your mirror!?&quot; Tifa cried back as her 
finger pointed at the offending object.

&quot;I swear, it&#39;s just a knick! Shiva-look, y&#39;see? The stupid thing still 
works and everything so I don&#39;t see what the big flippin&#39; problem is-&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t see what the problem is!? I could see the brand name of the 
driver&#39;s watch as he sped past me for crying out loud! The car was so 
close to my elbow I&#39;m surprised the wind didn&#39;t burn me or something!&quot;

&quot;Well naturally, because wind doesn&#39;t burn to begin wi-hold on...wait. 
You said you saw what brand the driver&#39;s watch was?&quot;

Tifa, at Yuffie&#39;s sudden question, blinked and shifted her weight to one 
foot. &quot;What does that have to do with anything?&quot;

&quot;What brand was it?&quot;

&quot;Your more concerned about the other driver&#39;s watch?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just curious! Did you REALLY see the kinda watch that guy had or 
are you just making that up? He had to have been going at at least 50 
miles an hour...lousy speed freak.&quot; the girl muttered the last part 
under her breath.

Tifa tongued her cheek. &quot;Yeah. I saw what the brand name was. It was a 
Redguard.&quot; she said tartly.

Yuffie scratched her head, as a sudden pensive thought over took her 
face. &quot;Y&#39;know, I thought I saw a flash of red when he went by...&quot; She 
gave Tifa a look of mingled admiration and disbelief, &quot;Gawd! I didn&#39;t 
know you had such a good eye!&quot;

At first, Tifa&#39;s face turned bright red with frustration, and she held 
up her clenched hands as if in preparation to scream. But then suddenly, 
the feeling left her in a rush, and a familiar bubbly emotion replaced 
it and turned the corners of her lips upward. As the laughter built up, 
the woman covered her face and pedaled backward. It took only a few 
steps before her heel hit a bump and she fell to the asphalt, spread 
onto her back. Yuffie started forward quickly as she saw the woman fall, 
a look of concern and bewilderment flashing across her face.

The evening sun was warm and content and it lit up the side of the 
ninja&#39;s face as she gazed uncertainly down at Tifa, whose delirious 
batch of amusement rang out into the air. She stood with her feet on 
either side of the fighter, her legs bent as she leaned down. &quot;Uh, are 
you okay?&quot; she asked slowly.

At her question, however, Tifa&#39;s humor seemed to worsen, and she no 
longer made a sound, but simply shook violently with giggles and hugged 
her ribs. When the girl saw that it would be a while before the woman 
calmed herself, she couldn&#39;t help but smile wryly and state with a flat 
tone, &quot;I think I&#39;m a little too good at making you laugh, Rusty.&quot;

When the woman didn&#39;t answer, Yuffie carefully sat herself atop the 
woman and quirked an eyebrow, &quot;You realize of course, that we&#39;re in a 
parking lot. Don&#39;t you wanna continue this elsewhere?&quot;

Tifa covered her eyes as she took deep breaths in an attempt to stop her 
laughter. Yuffie, exasperated, lifted Tifa&#39;s hands from her eyes and 
leaned forward, close to the woman&#39;s face. &quot;Peek-a-boo.&quot; she breathed. 
&quot;Seriously, let me help you up. Dirt&#39;s getting in your hair.&quot;

The fighter allowed the younger girl to help her up, a small grin still 
on her lips as Yuffie gazed at her quietly. &quot;You all right now?&quot; she 
asked.

Tifa sighed and ran her fingers through her hair. &quot;Yeah. It&#39;s just...I 
only just realized how absurd all of this is.&quot; She paused. &quot;I mean, I 
almost get clipped by a car and I somehow end up talking to you about 
watches.&quot;

Yuffie grinned triumphantly, &quot;I&#39;m sneaky that way, aren&#39;t I?&quot;

The fighter nodded her head with a laugh, &quot;Yeah, real slick, Yuffie.&quot; 
The woman sighed and wiped at her eye, &quot;But that...really did shake me 
up.&quot;

The ninja&#39;s face sobered. &quot;Y&#39;know...I didn&#39;t mean to seem like I didn&#39;t 
care about what happened before. It&#39;s just...nothing happened, right? No 
accident, no one hurt, nothing, not a thing. I didn&#39;t wanna focus on 
what could&#39;ve have happened...I just wanted to make it feel all right.&quot; 
The ninja rubbed the back of her neck ruefully, &quot;Granted, I could&#39;ve 
handled that, like, way better...&quot;

Tifa smiled again. &quot;No, I think it worked...I think...&quot;

Yuffie grinned suddenly, her eyes carefully looking at Tifa with a mix 
of humor and affection. &quot;I think I&#39;m buying you a Redguard watch for 
Christmas.&quot;

&quot;Do it, and I flush it down the toilet.&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s grin widened as she stepped close to Tifa and wrapped her arms 
around her waist. Tifa relaxed into the embrace, comforted by the feel 
of Yuffie near her. The ninja squeezed her gently. &quot;Are you feeling any 
better about getting on the bike with me again?&quot; she asked gently.

Tifa reached her hand up and gently stroked back the rebellious strands 
of hair that teased the girl&#39;s face. She grinned coyly as she brushed 
her nose against the ninja&#39;s. &quot;Only if you promise me you&#39;ll keep your 
head when I&#39;m loving you.&quot;

The girl shook her head and whispered, &quot;Now that&#39;s just not fair...&quot; and 
quietly Yuffie closed the small gap between them and her lips caught 
Tifa&#39;s. The woman briefly closed her eyes as a quiet sigh escaped her. 
The girl&#39;s lips were delightfully soft and wet. She wished the sensation 
lasted longer, but the girl pulled away with a faint smack, her eyes 
dark but inviting.

As she took Tifa&#39;s hand, the girl said in a low voice, &quot;Come on, there&#39;s 
one place I want to show you before the day&#39;s done...&quot;

----------

The road winded up the side of a cliff that overlooked the sea. Frail 
bushes with leaves colored red at the edges draped languidly over the 
sandy rocks that faced the sun. Here, the sound of the waves crashing 
surrounded them, their power managing to drown out the noises of the 
city. The buildings grew sparse and more petite as the wind became 
harsher at the elevated heights. Tifa spied a street sign as they 
ascended, and soundlessly she mouthed the words, &quot;Horacio Street.&quot;

Yuffie pulled into a mid-sized parking lot in front of a white domed 
building. From where they were, no other people could be seen, but the 
lot was packed with cars. The domed building seemed new as its high dome 
and wide columns cast a shadow over the two girls. Slim dark security 
camera&#39;s were installed near the doors, where a lanky security officer 
stood watch over those entering. Yuffie took off her helmet and looked 
back at Tifa. &quot;Well, here it is.&quot;

The woman took off her helmet and climbed off the bike slowly, her eyes 
trained on the bronze sign that hung from the small overhang. &quot;The 
Crystalline Dome?&quot; she said, brows furrowed. Yuffie nodded with an 
excited grin as she stood to her feet. &quot;Yeah! Come on, I don&#39;t want to 
be late for it.&quot;

Tifa blinked as the ninja pulled her toward the open entrance. &quot;Be late 
for what?&quot; the woman asked. But the only answer she received was the 
howl of the cool sea air as it chased them across the threshold into the 
dome. The fighter blinked rapidly as her eyes strained to see in the 
dark lobby, but a tug forward had her feet moving before her mind could 
orient itself.

&quot;Hey Yuffie, slow down, I can&#39;t even see my-&quot; The dark shape before Tifa 
gave a tumble, and the fighter felt herself bump into Yuffie&#39;s back.

&quot;Geez, what&#39;s with this carpeting!?&quot; the girl cried, &quot;It&#39;s all uneven!&quot;

Tifa sighed. &quot;So, like I said, can we slow down?&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s arm pointed forward suddenly. &quot;Hey is that light up there?&quot; she 
asked.

&quot;Where?&quot;

&quot;There, where the hall turns.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I think so...&quot;

&quot;Come on.&quot;

&quot;Yuffie-hey, wait!&quot;

Yuffie jogged toward the light, her jeans &#39;swishing&#39; with each stride. 
Her grip had tightened on Tifa&#39;s hand, and Tifa opened her mouth to ask 
if they had missed whatever it was they were going to see when they 
rounded the corner and a sudden bright window danced into her sight.

The window gave view to a small booth where a young girl sat reading a 
magazine. She was dressed in an over-sized shirt with a winged mog on 
it, her shoulders just rising over the counter by two inches. At the 
sight of Yuffie and Tifa emerging from the darkness, the small girl 
jumped and gasped, her shiny braces revealed in her moment of surprise. 
When she realized neither of them were a threat, however, she placed a 
small freckled hand on her chest and heaved a great sigh. &quot;Holey, 
moley!&quot; the girl cried, bright green eyes regarding Yuffie and Tifa 
scornfully, &quot;You scared my curls straight!&quot;

Yuffie shrugged apologetically, &quot;Sorry, kid. We didn&#39;t mean to scare 
you.&quot;

The girl shook her head as she turned her swivel chair forward. &quot;Nah, 
s&#39;okay. Gramps shoulda put lights in the hall, but he always says that, 
&#39;All anyone needs is that sign!&#39;&quot;

Tifa frowned, her eyes now adjusted to the new light. Out of the corner 
of her eyes she could make out posters for events and local shows pasted 
on the walls. With an odd twinge, she noticed there seemed to be panels 
around the posters.

Quietly, the woman shook off her observations. &quot;What sign?&quot; she asked 
the girl.

The girl sighed and rolled her eyes to the ceiling. &quot;The goofy sign that 
Gramps put up right next to the entrance. &#39;Watch your step, dim 
lighting.&#39;&quot;

&quot;Well that helped.&quot; Yuffie grumbled. &quot;Why didn&#39;t that guard say 
anything?&quot;

The girl shrugged. &quot;So you wanna see the crystals?&quot; she asked.

Yuffie nodded, taking out her money from her pocket. &quot;Yeah. We didn&#39;t 
miss that special show?&quot;

The girl glanced at the clock on the wall behind her to her right. 
&quot;Nope,&quot; she turned forward again. She jabbed a thumb at the price sign 
to her other side. &quot;A hundred-fifty gil each.&quot;

Tifa raised an eyebrow as Yuffie paid. A hundred-fifty gil? Just what 
were they seeing? Her eyes traveled to the sign the girl pointed at. The 
only show that was listed for that much was &quot;The Evening Spectacle.&quot;

The girl counted Yuffie&#39;s money shrewdly, her tongue caught between her 
teeth. Satisfied that she had not been ripped off, she pulled herself up 
onto the counter with a small grunt, her shoulders bunched about her 
ears as she lifted an arm to point forward. &quot;Behind you guys is the hall 
leading to the show room doors. Ya can&#39;t touch the crystals, and ya 
can&#39;t shine any lights of your own. Here, stick your hands through the 
little window there. I&#39;m gonna stamp you so&#39;s the guards don&#39;t kick you 
out.&quot;

&quot;Can we stay past sunset?&quot;

&quot;Nope, the place closes after that.&quot;

Yuffie nodded and stuck her hand through the small opening in the glass. 
The girl took a large red stamper and, after pressing it to an ink pad, 
stamped the ninja&#39;s hand. Tifa did the same and she looked to Yuffie as 
she spoke. &quot;All right, then.&quot; the ninja exclaimed, &quot;Let&#39;s go see the 
crystals!&quot;

The ninja took the fighter&#39;s hand and began to lead her to the doors. 
Tifa squeezed her hand as she asked under her breath, &quot;Okay, seriously, 
what am I going to see here? Is it some crazy light show with lasers or 
what?&quot;

Tifa could see Yuffie shrug as she headed toward the dim green entrance 
sign that flickered over the dark set of double doors before them. &quot;It&#39;s 
something like that, I guess...&quot; the ninja replied evasively. At the 
doors, the ninja placed a slender hand, her head turned to look at Tifa. 
&quot;Ready?&quot; she asked, her voice laced with excitement.

Tifa gave a nod, her apprehension recalling memories of grotesque 
monster displays and fat chocobos. &quot;Open it.&quot; she said.

Yuffie pushed the heavy door open with a small grunt and Tifa eyes 
squinted before going wide. They entered a circular room with concrete 
flooring, the domed ceiling reaching high above their heads. Statues, 
some tall and some not, graced the space. A slim red rope blocked 
visitors from crossing. Crystal spears, perfect and geometrical, 
sprouted at the feet of these carefully crafted sentinels, whose angular 
faces depicted the deepest of emotions. At the walls, twisted, high 
reaching trees with emerald leaves sheltered woodland creatures and 
lithe elves, whose slim faces and sapphire eyes displayed innocent 
curiosity. Illuminating the artwork from the floor were aimed lights 
that brought a glow to all. At the center of everything, however, on a 
raised pedestal, was a maiden, with arms spread wide in acceptance of a 
higher essence.

Tifa&#39;s hand flew to her mouth as she stepped forward, the shock robbing 
her of words. She had seen things crafted from crystal before, but the 
level of craftsmanship was beyond anything she could have imagined.

&quot;Wow...&quot; the woman finally managed to breath. She turned to look back at 
Yuffie, who stood near the doors her eyes also wide as she gazed about 
the room.

&quot;Excuse me, ladies?&quot; Both turned to see two men standing on either side 
of the doors. Both were dressed in security officer uniforms. &quot;If we 
could see your stamped hands please...&quot; Yuffie and Tifa both showed the 
back of their hands and the officers gave a satisfied nod. &quot;The show&#39;s 
about to start, so if you need to use the restroom, please do so now. We 
can&#39;t let anyone in or out once the show starts.&quot;

Yuffie nodded as she stepped close to Tifa and pressed her hand to the 
fighter&#39;s back, urging her forward. At the ninja&#39;s silent encouragement, 
Tifa ventured closer to the statues, and she quickly became aware of the 
other people in the room. Tourists and locals alike mingled among the 
statues, their eyes transfixed with the art. Though the room was large, 
it felt cramped, yet none spoke above a murmur.

With eyes alight, Tifa turned to look at Yuffie, whose arm had found its 
way around the woman&#39;s waist. &quot;This is amazing Yuffie.&quot;

The ninja&#39;s face was quiet and relaxed, her eyes fixated on the statue 
of the maiden. &quot;I heard,&quot; the girl began in a low, almost reverent 
voice, &quot;That every statue was cut from their own, single,rock of 
crystal.&quot;

She looked at Tifa, her eyes soft. &quot;Can you imagine? How could they have 
found something large enough to cut any of these? Not to mention the 
crystal would have to be flawless, or else the figure wouldn&#39;t come out 
the way they&#39;d want...&quot; Yuffie gave Tifa&#39;s side a slight squeeze. &quot;It 
took four generations to find the right crystals to work with. Four 
generations to make what we&#39;re looking at now...&quot;

&quot;Unbelievable...&quot; Tifa breathed as she eyed the center pedestal, her 
eyes lingering on the delicate maiden and her spiritual ascent.

Yuffie, with eyes lit faintly by the glow of the floor lights, watched 
as Tifa found herself before the maiden, her lips parted and her eyes 
wide with wonder.

Then the lights went out.

&quot;Yuffie!? What happened??&quot; Tifa wasn&#39;t the only one to sound alarmed. 
Small gasps and sudden exclamations could be heard throughout the room.

But Yuffie&#39;s voice fluttered warmly over the flesh of the fighter&#39;s 
cheek. &quot;Relax, Tifa. Look.&quot;

Light flooded her eyes. Tifa held up her arm to shield her face. Golden 
rays broke between her meager defense. Tentatively, the woman lowered 
her arm, and her expression turned awestruck.

Sunlight.

It was warm and glorious, the ferocity of its strength dampened only by 
the gentle royalty of its own glow. The ray was a single strong beam-a 
beam that descended from the center of the ceiling, a ray of the dying 
sun reflected down by a mirror. It shone down on the maiden, and as she 
sparkled and shone, the meaning of her open arms became clear.

The lattices that made up her being, the perfect facets, the distinctive 
cuts, were no longer a work of art-but a work of genius. The light, 
scattered and bent, came to fall on the crystal creatures around the 
maiden in a finely orchestrated plan, and with a haunting rejuvenation, 
they were suddenly more alive and beautiful than they had been prior.

Tifa&#39;s breath caught in her throat. Next to her, Yuffie smirked. &quot;Like 
it?&quot; she asked amid the applause and disbelieving laughter.

&quot;Love it.&quot; Tifa whispered back. Her hand curled around the girl&#39;s back 
to hold her side in turn. The room suddenly felt warm and the fighter&#39;s 
gaze slowly left the upturned face of the crystal maiden, to the smooth 
content expression that rested on Yuffie&#39;s face. The girl seemed quiet, 
even subdued. This made the woman anxious, though she knew not why, so 
she leaned forward and nuzzled the ninja&#39;s neck.

Yuffie, stirred out of her quiet reverie, reached a hand up to caress 
the woman&#39;s face. &quot;Something the matter, Rusty?&quot; the girl asked quietly. 
Tifa lifted her head to gaze properly at the girl&#39;s face. Then, with a 
start, she noticed the girl&#39;s eyes were glistening with tears.

Aware that attention from people nearby was beginning to focus on them, 
Tifa took her hand, placed it at the base of the girl&#39;s head, and kissed 
her. The affection that overtook her in that moment made her bold. The 
sudden murmur and hissing that took place caused a jolt in her stomach, 
but somehow the fighter knew it wasn&#39;t from fear. Exhilaration caused 
her heart to pump harder as Yuffie&#39;s hand clutched sharply at the small 
of her back, pulling her closer. As Tifa pulled away, she stood onto her 
toes to kiss the ninja&#39;s brow. &quot;Thank you for bringing me here, Yuffie.&quot; 
she breathed.

Yuffie blinked at her, her lips glistening in the refracted sunlight. 
Dazedly she asked, &quot;You wanna go outside and come back in? I&#39;m sure 
it&#39;ll be just as neat as it was the first time!&quot;

Tifa laughed and wrapped her arms around the ninja&#39;s neck. &quot;No,&quot; she 
said, ignoring the stares of those around her. &quot;Let&#39;s just stay here a 
little longer.&quot;

Yuffie nodded, and the fighter could feel the girl&#39;s bangs tease her 
face. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she hugged Tifa and let out a sigh, &quot;Yeah...&quot;

And they stayed. They stayed as the crowd thinned and the light died. 
They stayed until the guards came forward to inform them that the 
building was closing.

Hand in hand, the lovers left the room and re-entered the dark hallway. 
Ahead, like a beacon, they could see the lit up booth where the young 
girl still sat, reading her magazine.

Instead of turning down the hall leading to the exit, Yuffie held up a 
shadowy hand and said, &quot;I wanna ask that girl something...&quot;

Tifa shrugged in the dark. &quot;All right, I don&#39;t mind.&quot;

So the two, once again headed toward the window. Tifa noted that the 
girl was wearing glasses now. Yuffie rapped on the glass. &quot;S&#39;cuse me. 
Kid?&quot;

The girl looked up as she closed her magazine, her eyes magnified by the 
thick lenses of her glasses. &quot;Yes-?&quot; she halted in her words and her 
face turned pale beneath her freckles.

Yuffie cleared her throat and leaned forward, so that the light of the 
booth illuminated her face in full. &quot;Hey, just wondering-what do you 
guys REALLY do to keep these statues safe? These guards aren&#39;t much, and 
neither are the cameras. Does your gramps have something up his sleeve 
or what?&quot;

The girl didn&#39;t say anything for a moment. She sat, her body stiff, as 
she regarded both Yuffie and Tifa with flickering eyes. Finally, she 
spoke.

&quot;You-You&#39;re Yuffie Kisaragi!&quot; she nodded toward Tifa, her eyes wide, 
&quot;And you&#39;re Tifa Lockhart!&quot;

The two women looked at each other. Yuffie, amused, looked back at the 
young girl with an arrogant smirk. &quot;Yep. You don&#39;t remember us from 
before? We were the last ones allowed to see the light show!&quot;

&quot;Well, m-my glasses-I didn&#39;t have my-&quot; the girl faltered, and she looked 
down at her lap with a serious blush. &quot;Aw, how embarrassing...&quot;

Yuffie frowned at her. &quot;What is it, kid?&quot;

But Tifa noticed it. Her eyes lingered on the cover of the girl&#39;s 
magazine. She grabbed Yuffie&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Uh...Yuffie? I think you&#39;re 
father&#39;s lackey&#39;s aren&#39;t the only ones we&#39;ve gotta worry about...&quot; Tifa 
pointed and the ninja&#39;s eyes followed.

&quot;What do you me-oh.&quot;

Resting on the counter was a pink gossip magazine titled &#39;FIREWIRE&#39;. The 
cover image, blown up framed in a heart shape, was of Tifa and Yuffie 
embracing on the Costa Del Sol beach. Both women pressed their faces to 
the glass to stare down at it, the consequences of this exposure already 
sprouting like weeds in their minds. At the bottom of the cover the 
words, &quot;LOCKHART &amp; KISARAGI: On the road and on each other!&quot; could be 
read in bold print.

Tifa&#39;s face turned beet red, &quot;That&#39;s uncalled for! How can they print 
that!?&quot;

Yuffie leaned back and tugged idly at her ear as her eyes looked up and 
turned distant with reminiscence, &quot;Well...y&#39;know we have-&quot;

The girl blushed as bad as Tifa, and with a pull of a lever under her 
seat she sank out of view beneath the counter.

Mortified, Tifa swatted at Yuffie&#39;s arm, her embarrassment mounting. &quot;We 
haven&#39;t!&quot; she shrieked.

Yuffie quickly shrank from her. &quot;I just meant the hugging! We did a lot 
of hugging!&quot; she amended quickly.

Angry, Tifa pounded on the booth window. &quot;Hey! Excuse me, little girl-?&quot;

There was a sharp &#39;clack&#39;, light flooded the hall, and a security 
barrier shot up between the women and the booth. Bewildered and 
surprised, Tifa squeezed her eyes shut against the sudden harsh light, 
her feet stumbling back from the booth. Yuffie gave a shout and raised 
her hands, her eyes squinted as she struggled to make out what was 
happening. The indentations Tifa noticed earlier turned out to be 
panels, which sunk in and slid back to allow barrel guns to push 
forward. A siren ripped through the air, and the sound of the exits 
sealing could be heard down the hall.

An automated voice began to echo around them. &quot;Step away from the window 
and place your hands behind your head. Any suspicious action will result 
in immediate termination.&quot;

Tifa eyes now open to slits, slowly complied.

Yuffie after regaining her composure, stepped back so that she stood 
next to Tifa. Her eyebrows rose as she placed her hands behind her head.

&quot;Well...at least my question from earlier was answered!&quot;

----------

&quot;I feel sorry for that kid. She looked so miserable when her grampa came 
to sort things out.&quot;

&quot;What kind of a security system is that, anyway? It was so sensitive! It 
shouldn&#39;t activate unless initiated by the owner!&quot;

&quot;...Uh, well, you did bang on the window pretty hard.&quot;

&quot;I was just upset!&quot;

Yuffie gave the fighter a sidelong glance from where she was. In their 
hotel room, the ninja stood before the sliding glass door leading to the 
balcony, and Tifa sat on her bed with a copy of FIREWIRE gripped in her 
hands. After apologizing profusely to the girl and her grampa, they were 
able to escape trouble with the authorities...that was, after they gave 
the police and the old man their autographs. The ride home was quiet and 
tense, the discomfort punctuated only by a quick stop at a gas station 
to buy a copy of the offending gossip magazine.

As Tifa read the article, her expression turned more and more disgusted.

&quot;Everything!&quot; the woman spat, as she tossed the magazine furiously onto 
the ground. &quot;Everything about our trip so far is there. From when you 
met me at Tiesmire up until now. They&#39;ve even got pictures! Tons from 
when we went to Gold Saucer and EVEN the Taxidermy Museum! I don&#39;t 
understand how they could have possibly gotten them!&quot;

Yuffie shrugged, &quot;Uteki should be ashamed. These creeps got us better 
than him and his men did.&quot;

Tifa frowned and looked at her. &quot;It doesn&#39;t bother you?&quot;

The ninja&#39;s eyes flickered to the woman, and there was a sharpness in 
them that staunched Tifa&#39;s sudden indignation. &quot;No. Does it bother you?&quot;

Tifa&#39;s shoulders slumped and she rubbed at her face. &quot;No. I&#39;m sorry, I 
just...&quot; she hesitated and peeped between her fingers to stare at her 
crossed legs, already dressed in cotton pajama pants. &quot;I just wanted 
things to come out a little more gracefully is all...This isn&#39;t going to 
stay just here. It&#39;ll become news that everyone&#39;ll be aware of by 
tomorrow morning. Barret is gonna throw a fit...&quot;

&quot;Well he&#39;ll just have to deal with it then, won&#39;t he?&quot; Yuffie said 
roughly. She shook her head and gestured vaguely around her. &quot;What does 
it matter how people find out? Barret and the others suffer the same 
sort of tabloid-intense attention as we do. If they can&#39;t see that this 
got away from us before we could even gather ourselves, then I say 
they&#39;re a bunch of chuckle heads!&quot;

Tifa sighed and rubbed the back of her neck, which was sore from looking 
down so long. &quot;I know. You&#39;re right, I know it...&quot; the fighter mumbled.

Yuffie stepped quietly toward her. &quot;So...&quot; she placed her hands behind 
her head and gazed down her nose at Tifa. &quot;You don&#39;t mind everyone 
knowing, then?&quot;

The fighter looked up at her and shook her head. She held a hand up to 
her chest and gazed sincerely at the girl. &quot;Please don&#39;t misunderstand, 
Yuffie. I just...I hate how they&#39;ve robbed us of the chance to speak for 
ourselves. I knew this would happen eventually, but I wanted it to be on 
our terms...&quot;

Yuffie frowned and sat across from her on the edge of the bed, her eyes 
fierce. &quot;They didn&#39;t rob us of anything, Tifa. Hounds like them squabble 
over scraps. We&#39;ve got the real story right here.&quot; she pointed to 
herself and Tifa.

Tifa sighed and gazed down at the magazine on the floor. &quot;Well...the 
article did seem a bit rushed. The last parts of it looked like they 
were added just before publication.&quot; the woman rubbed her neck. &quot;At 
least they didn&#39;t get anything from the Neon Carnivale. They were 
probably putting the finishing touches then.&quot;

The ninja nodded, &quot;See?&quot;

Tifa flung herself backward, allowing her legs to stretch out. An 
irritated sound escaped her lips. &quot;But it bothers me so much!&quot; she 
complained.

Yuffie raised an eyebrow at her. Her eyes traveled up the length of the 
fighter&#39;s body as her fingers dug into the fabric of the blanket. 
Unaware, the older woman took a deep breath, her gaze now focused on the 
ceiling over her. The cool air of the room sent a soft draft along her 
exposed stomach, her tank top pulled past her bellybutton as her arms 
stretched over her head.

Yuffie shifted from where she sat and asked quietly. &quot;So do you think 
it&#39;s just one guy tailing us? If it were any more, I would&#39;ve noticed 
&#39;em...&quot; in a smooth, fluid motion that caused little disturbance along 
the bed, the ninja leaned forward, her back curved and her deep hazelnut 
eyes dark with intent.

Tifa scowled grumpily. &quot;I don&#39;t know...but if I see him I think I&#39;ll 
break his stupid camera...&quot;

With deft skill, the ninja crawled over Tifa&#39;s legs, her hands finding 
place at either side of Tifa&#39;s waist. &quot;You think they&#39;re watching us 
now?&quot; she asked in almost a whisper.

The fighter closed her eyes and turned her head to the side. &quot;I hope 
they&#39;re not.&quot; she grumbled, sour on the subject.

Yuffie&#39;s lips pulled back in a fiendish smile. &quot;...I hope they are.&quot;

Tifa&#39;s throat tightened to let out the question, &quot;Why?&quot; when she felt 
something wet and warm on her navel. A small cry replacing her query, 
the woman lifted her head with a quick jerk as her right arm flew down 
to prop herself up onto her elbow.

Yuffie&#39;s eyes peered up at her through the dark strands of her hair. 
There was a dull glint to them. Tifa could feel a shiver run through her 
as the ninja, still smiling her fiendish smile, blew against the wet 
skin of Tifa&#39;s bellybutton gently. The sensation caused the woman&#39;s skin 
to turn to goosebumps, and her fingers gripped the sheet of the bed 
anxiously. &quot;...Yuffie?&quot; she squeaked.

The girl didn&#39;t answer her. She traveled up Tifa&#39;s stomach as her lips 
left featherlight kisses across the skin. Her body shifted and her right 
leg slid up between the woman&#39;s legs, causing the fighter to 
instinctively jerk her legs up into a half-bent position. The inside of 
her left thigh brushed along Yuffie&#39;s side as she did this, and the 
other leg found itself between Yuffie&#39;s. The warmth that greeted it 
caused a knot in Tifa&#39;s stomach.

Yuffie&#39;s left hand arose with languid deliberateness from its place on 
the bed. The fingertips traced upwards, their reaches disappearing 
beneath the warm shadow of Tifa&#39;s tank top.

For the first time, alarm set into Tifa&#39;s heart as she became aware of 
the hand&#39;s final destination. &quot;Yuffie, please-&quot; the woman breathed 
painfully. She wished frantically that she had worn a bra underneath her 
top. Her insecurity, like a foul beast of the Crater, dug its claws into 
her mind and the woman tensed her shoulders in preparation of sitting 
up.

&quot;Shhhh...&quot; the ninja hissed against the woman&#39;s skin, freezing her 
before she could do anything. Yuffie raised her eyes, and deep within 
them glowed a desire that was almost unmerciful, as if it sought to 
devour all that its attention fell upon. Tifa shivered. Of all the looks 
she had received in her lifetime, few had appeared as absolute as the 
one she received now. The weightiness of it subjugated Tifa to a 
helpless position. She found herself like an animal pinned beneath the 
clutches of a stronger being...

...A predator.

Yuffie continued to stare up into Tifa&#39;s anguished face. Her hand tensed 
and flexed against the fighter&#39;s skin. The action caused the woman to 
take a sharp intake of breath. Then, Yuffie&#39;s hand relaxed, and with a 
gentleness that seemed almost teasing, the ninja reached up and brushed 
the side of Tifa&#39;s breast with her thumb.

The woman let out a shaky breath. Her heart pounded hard against her 
chest as she became aware of the fact that the shirt she wore was little 
more than a device-a lever that the ninja used to drag on the moment. 
There was no true separation between the two girls. Another two inches 
and Tifa could no longer believe in the sham of her coverings. The ninja 
knew this, and her eyes seemed to fill with mirth at the fighter&#39;s 
discomfort.

The younger girl, still using only her thumb, pulled up the fabric, so 
that the underside of Tifa&#39;s right breast lay exposed. With a brief 
glance at the older woman, Yuffie leaned forward and swept her tongue 
across it, leaving it slick with her saliva. The woman let out a whimper 
as the ninja raked her teeth over the wet skin, her breath hot and 
harsh. Her legs squeezed around Yuffie&#39;s, and her eyes rolled shut. &quot;I 
can&#39;t take this.&quot; she thought painfully.

She was certain Yuffie, with her sharp senses, could pick up her quick 
heartbeat. Perhaps it fueled her? With an intense blush, Tifa wondered 
if the girl could feel the growing warmth between her legs, too.

As the ninja finally lifted her head and leaned forward, her leg pressed 
intimately against the fighter&#39;s heat, and alternatively, the woman 
could feel the girl slide along her right leg. Tifa swallowed hard.

Did people do this often? She wondered in dazed naivety. The sensations 
were almost unbearable. It was almost too sweet a torture...

But as Yuffie leaned in and kissed her, mouth sucking at her lower lip, 
the woman thought with fading coherence that the pain could be well 
worth the pleasure. The girl pulled back slowly. Her face hovered inches 
from the fighter&#39;s, and Yuffie&#39;s breath came heavy and warm as she gazed 
at the woman with lidded eyes. Uncertain of herself, Tifa gazed back, 
her growing arousal at odds with the emotions that roiled inside her.

Yuffie leaned forward again, brushing her nose against Tifa&#39;s. &quot;Are you 
scared?&quot; she asked in a voice deep and mesmerizing.

Inwardly the woman&#39;s mind raced to come up with a truthful answer. She 
was frightened how far this game would go. She was frightened how the 
ninja would react when she saw the fighter&#39;s true self-the human being 
stripped of all pretense and complication. Would Yuffie be satisfied? 
Would Yuffie be disgusted? But perhaps what frightened her the most, was 
what would happen if she should turn Yuffie away.

&quot;I&#39;m not scared.&quot; Tifa lied. Her voice seemed weak and unconvincing.

The ninja chuckled suddenly, and her fingers traced a line down the 
woman&#39;s stomach. &quot;So why are you shivering so much?&quot; she asked with a 
tilt of the head.

&quot;Because you&#39;re teasing me!&quot; Tifa said in a hiss, tormented.

Yuffie smirked. Suddenly, the fighter felt like she had walked into a 
trap.

The ninja slid her right knee up, increasing the pressure between Tifa&#39;s 
legs. The woman&#39;s back arched, and her body pressed against Yuffie&#39;s. 
Her lips parted and a small whimper escaped her. Leaning in so that she 
could speak into her ear, Yuffie whispered in a voice that could only be 
said with a smile, &quot;Should I stop teasing you now?&quot;

Then a sharp ring ripped through the air, and both women froze. With 
eyes like a demon&#39;s, Yuffie pulled away from Tifa and gazed dangerously 
at the phone on the bed stand. Tifa, eyes wide, stared at the girl to 
see what she would do.

Several rings sounded. It soon became clear that the caller would not 
hang up.

Cursing under her breath, Yuffie carefully disentangled herself from 
Tifa and stood to her feet. She picked up the receiver with a snarl. 
&quot;Yeah? Who&#39;s this?&quot; she paused to roll her eyes to the ceiling. &quot;Otis?&quot;

Tifa flopped backward onto the bed and a sigh escaped her. An odd 
mixture of relief and disappointment coursed through her, the feeling of 
cold air rude and sobering to her skin.

Yuffie closed her eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose as she hissed 
through her teeth, &quot;What the heck is it? You kinda interrupted me.&quot; Her 
eyes snapped open as his frazzled voice could be heard on the other 
line. Tifa tilted her head back to stare up at the ninja as she answered 
incredulously, &quot;Reporters!?&quot; the ninja&#39;s face turned a livid red, &quot;NO, 
you idiot! I don&#39;t want to talk to those vultures!&quot; she paused again, 
incredulity now joining her anger. &quot;What should you say to them?&quot; She 
held the receiver up to her mouth and shouted, &quot;TRY TELLING THEM HOW YOU 
JUST LOST ME A GOOD SCREW, YOU GODDAMN CAKE-EATER!&quot;

Tifa winced as the ninja slammed the phone back on its dial.

There was a pause.

&quot;...Yuffie, I don&#39;t think that was all together necessary.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s got no sense. What sort of hotel manager asks his residents if 
they&#39;d like to be bothered by tabloid journalists?&quot;

&quot;The kind that&#39;s dealing with OUR tabloid journalists?&quot; Tifa paused as a 
thought occurred to her. &quot;You don&#39;t think he&#39;ll actually say that, do 
you? The um...&quot; she blushed all over again. &quot;The last thing you said?&quot;

Yuffie froze, the anger on her face fading.

&quot;Nah,&quot; she said after a moment. &quot;Otis can get a little wishy-washy, but 
I doubt he&#39;d cave in to people like that...least, not...y&#39;know...on 
purpose...&quot; The ninja fell silent. Nervously she licked her lips as she 
picked the receiver up again and pushed the dial button for the front 
desk.

&quot;Uh...Otis? Hey, buddy? D&#39;you think you could just do me, like, a huge 
favor...?&quot;

Tifa took this moment to stand from the bed. The movement made her head 
feel light, and she paused briefly, her eyes falling shut against the 
dots that appeared. Yuffie was mumbling now into the phone. The 
fighter&#39;s eyes eased open again, and she turned her head to gaze at the 
ninja&#39;s back as she spoke to Otis. The light from the lamp she stood in 
front of outlined her body, leaving the rest in shadow.

The fighter sensed the girl was about to hang up the phone, so she stood 
as quickly as she could without seeming like she was trying to get away, 
then went to the balcony.

There the cool night air greeted her, and again she shivered. With 
morose eyes turned to the lights of the city, Tifa&#39;s mind began to turn 
with thoughts both harrowing and depressing. The most prevailing of 
these thoughts came to be the question she had, up until a short time 
ago, not given much attention to.

Was she good enough for Yuffie? The girl was filled with an abundance of 
vitality, her desire and ambition as consuming as a flash fire. Tifa 
knew the ninja loved her soul, but with a sinking heart, she also 
recognized that that was not enough.

The sound of the sliding glass door opening caused Tifa to turn around. 
Yuffie stood, gazing at her with eyes that searched. The fighter averted 
her face without thinking, a blush coming to her face. The ninja&#39;s hand 
gripped the handle of the door a little tighter, and she looked down.

&quot;She...really was scared.&quot; she thought, her shoulders turning tense.

&quot;Did you sort things out with Otis?&quot; Tifa asked, her eyes turning back 
to the city lights.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Yuffie returned, her tone subdued. She glanced up at the woman 
across from her. The fighter gave a soft nod. Yuffie stared at her, her 
brows furrowed together. The lights of the city brought fire in her eyes 
as she asked quietly, &quot;You wanna use the shower first? I was thinking of 
going in...&quot;

Tifa looked briefly back at the ninja. Her eyes didn&#39;t meet hers. &quot;You 
go ahead. I can wait.&quot;

Yuffie didn&#39;t move for a whole minute. On the tip of her tongue danced 
apologies, &quot;Sorry for backing you into a corner, sorry for making you 
feel pressured, sorry for being a monumental mincehead.&quot; But they were 
trapped by the girl&#39;s pursed lips.

She turned, and after gathering her towel and clothes, she entered the 
bathroom.

----------

The shower was incredibly sobering. The cold streams washed away all 
distractions. All that was left were her thoughts...and sometimes she 
hated the thoughts.

Yuffie sat at the bottom of the tub, the rain of water on her head heavy 
and like a crash of clarity.

The moment had seemed an eternity, but it all had been so quick when one 
looked back at it. Her body had seemed to take control of her. At the 
sight of Tifa lying back on the bed, her skin exposed, her brow 
furrowed, and her lip pouted slightly...she had lost it. She had never 
stopped to think exactly what it was she was doing or the effect it 
would have. In truth, the ninja had only meant to innocently tease the 
fighter. Perhaps tickle her.

So what happened?

Unnerved, Yuffie stared at the white floor of the tub.

What had happened to not pushing it? What had happened to letting it 
happen with time?

What had happened to caring about Tifa&#39;s feelings?

Her teachers and trainers had called her petulant and impatient. She 
took their claims lightly, not entirely caring if they were true, but 
now it seemed a problem. &quot;I feel like a filthy lecher,&quot; the girl thought 
shamefully, her eyes turned downcast. The stream of water entered her 
eyes and she shut them, the burn there behind her eyelids.

&quot;I forgot she hadn&#39;t ever...well, I mean, it&#39;s all new to me too...but I 
know that isn&#39;t that great an excuse.&quot; She sighed and rested her head on 
her bent knees. &quot;It&#39;s a totally lame excuse, really...&quot;

Streams swirled about her toes and she wiggled them idly. &quot;How do I make 
it up to her? How can I explain? &#39;Tifa, y&#39;know...I didn&#39;t mean to sorta 
molest you, it&#39;s just all those weeks of hugging and fooling around...it 
all felt like foreplay!&#39;&quot; The ninja lifted her head to scowl suddenly at 
her knees. &quot;Actually, that isn&#39;t so far off! I mean, sure, we only 
confessed our feelings like...two days ago. But geez, hadn&#39;t we been 
practically flirting around almost this entire trip?&quot; Yuffie&#39;s scowl 
faded. &quot;No, but I still promised not to push it. Maybe I&#39;d give a bit of 
encouragement sure, but hitting Tifa so fast so that she couldn&#39;t even 
gather herself enough to give me an honest answer isn&#39;t exactly the best 
way to go about that sorta stuff.&quot;

The ninja rubbed sourly at her eye. &quot;Still though, I&#39;d wish she&#39;d have 
just said something...&quot;

&quot;She tried to.&quot; said a voice in the girl&#39;s head, &quot;But you told her to be 
quiet.&quot;

Yuffie hugged her arms, her fingernails digging into the skin.

&quot;I thought I had this all down pact. I thought I could commit myself to 
not being a self-serving butt head. But look at this, I&#39;ve already 
screwed up. Can I really honor Tifa&#39;s feelings? I knew how soft she had 
gotten, how sensitive she became over the years. Roland didn&#39;t need to 
point that out to me. To me it seemed easy, though; getting Tifa to live 
again, loving her, and filling my desire at the same time. But I messed 
up...here at the starting line, I messed up. And now I&#39;m an ass.&quot; the 
girl&#39;s scowl returned, darker this time as she glared at her knees. 
&quot;...Maybe I&#39;m not ready for this &#39;serious relationship&#39; crud. Who&#39;s to 
say I&#39;ve grown anymore since Avalanche? Who&#39;s to say Tifa loves me 
enough to forgive my mistakes? My flaws?&quot;

The girl leaned her shoulder against the shower wall, the corners of her 
mouth turned downward.

&quot;...Who&#39;s to say a &#39;petulant&#39; brat like me deserves Tifa at all?&quot;

----------

Tifa came back into the hotel room some fifteen minutes after she heard 
the bathroom door close from outside. When she saw the girl was still in 
the shower, she paused. She was surprised Yuffie took so long. The girl 
didn&#39;t normally take such long showers. The woman was further 
discomforted by the fact that she heard no singing. Yuffie usually took 
to singing whenever she bathed.

&quot;She&#39;s mad at me...&quot; the fighter thought with a heavy sigh.

She sat heavily on the bed, the covers now gone cold from her absence. 
With eyes glassy and mournful, the woman gazed forward toward the door. 
She felt a sudden disgust at her cowardice, her unwillingness to 
solidify the very love she claimed to have. The self-loathing weighed on 
Tifa&#39;s shoulders, causing them to slump low in dejection.

Again, the phone suddenly rang.

Tifa stared at it for a moment, and her memory returned to barely twenty 
minutes ago. With a soft snort, the woman stood and answered the phone. 
&quot;Otis,&quot; the fighter said with a sneer and an unkind voice. Her sudden 
anger at the hotel manager masked her own guilt like a thin perfume. 
&quot;Look, just tell those reporters to-&quot;

&quot;Woman, who do you think yer talkin&#39; to?&quot;

The gruff, smoke raked voice caused Tifa to stutter. &quot;Wha!? I, ah, um-&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Cid, Tifa.&quot;

&quot;Cid? Cid Highwind?&quot;

&quot;No. Cid, &#39;The Dancing Ass Clown&#39;. YES, damn it! It&#39;s Cid Highwind!&quot;

Tifa scratched her head, &quot;How&#39;d you get this number?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a regular fuckin&#39; sleuth. What can I say? Actually, it&#39;s common 
knowledge where you&#39;re at now. I&#39;m surprised you haven&#39;t had your door 
beat down yet.&quot;

Tifa felt her stomach sink to her feet. &quot;Oh...&quot; she tapped her fingers 
on the phone. &quot;So...is there any particular reason you called?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll give you three guesses.&quot;

The fighter clenched her jaw. &quot;I&#39;ll only need one.&quot; she muttered

&quot;What&#39;s all this shit on the news about, Tifa?&quot;

&quot;Cid, no cursing.&quot; the woman warned.

&quot;Shera and the baby are out, and it&#39;s a good thing cuz I don&#39;t think I 
can keep much composure what with all this crap I&#39;m hearing!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care,&quot; Tifa said obstinately. &quot;Don&#39;t curse at me. You&#39;ll only 
make me angry.&quot;

&quot;FINE! Be angry! See if I give a flyin&#39; fuckin&#39; hoot!&quot; the older man 
snapped, his country accent suddenly more profound.

&quot;If you don&#39;t speak civil to me, I&#39;m going to hang up, Cid.&quot;

The man paused.

&quot;...Is any of it true?&quot; his voice was quiet and solemn. Tifa, with no 
small amount of indignation, noted that it matched the grave tone of a 
man speaking of death.

&quot;Yes.&quot; she said snidely. &quot;Yes, Cid. It&#39;s all true. And tell Barret too, 
when you call him next.&quot;

&quot;Tell him yourself.&quot; Cid spat. He paused again. There was a clatter on 
the other line and the man let out a sigh. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell us 
anything? Either of you?&quot;

Tifa rubbed at her face wearily. &quot;You haven&#39;t read too far into this, 
have you? This is a recent development.&quot;

&quot;Then why the hell am I seeing pages of you and Yuffie together over 
several days?&quot;

&quot;Because we&#39;re on a road trip Cid! It&#39;s kinda hard to avoid one 
another!&quot;

&quot;Just be honest with me, damn it!&quot; the man said, strained. The frown on 
Tifa&#39;s face faded as she heard a note of hurt in his voice. &quot;Ain&#39;t we 
supposed to be buddies?&quot; he asked, &quot;What in the fuck did me or the 
others do to be left in the dark? Is that why you never stopped by? 
Hell, or did&#39;ja take social tips from Cloud and Vincent?&quot;

Tifa let out a sigh of her own, her eyes falling shut. &quot;Hush. You&#39;re 
reading into things too much. I didn&#39;t visit you for so long 
because...because I didn&#39;t feel complete. I felt lost and unhappy. And 
it&#39;s true when I say that me and Yuffie became a couple only recently. 
Those pictures you see? They just narrate how we got close over time.&quot;

All she heard was silence on the other end of the line. For a moment, 
the fighter thought that Cid may have hung up, or the line was cut. But 
a rough cough banished her concerns. &quot;So...she treated you well so far?&quot; 
the man asked uncomfortably.

For the first time since the conversation began, Tifa&#39;s lips lifted in a 
small smile. The man&#39;s question was more than idle concern. ...It was an 
odd sort of acceptance. &quot;Yes. She&#39;s treating me well.&quot; the woman 
replied. Sadly, she thought, &quot;It&#39;s me that&#39;s the problem.&quot;

The man gave a gruff, &quot;Hrm.&quot; There was another clatter on the other end 
of the line, and he suddenly gave a harsh laugh. &quot;Damn! I really shoulda 
saw this coming!&quot;

Confused, Tifa asked, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

The man made a non-committal noise. &quot;Feh, I just thought you two acted 
strange back when you visited me.&quot;

The woman blushed and curled the phone cord about her index finger 
shyly. &quot;A person could see even then, huh?&quot;

&quot;Well...I dunno. I&#39;m sorta thick in the head, y&#39;know? But anybody&#39;d 
who&#39;d know you two woulda recognized somethin&#39; different.&quot;

Tifa gave a nod, momentarily forgetting the man could not see this. 
Hurriedly, she responded with a, &quot;Oh, uh, all right then...&quot; the woman 
bit her lip. &quot;Cid, is...is any of this causing you trouble?&quot;

&quot;Wha&#39;dya mean?&quot; Cid returned quizzically.

&quot;I mean reporters, or...crazy people,&quot; the woman shrugged, again 
forgetting that Cid could not see. &quot;I dunno.&quot;

&quot;Nah. None of that...yet. &#39;Specting it, though. I&#39;ll bet Reeve&#39;ll be 
callin&#39; in for a bit of damage control or somethin...&quot; the man gave a 
short squawk, &quot;Oh! Uh, not-not to say that...uh...well, there was any 
damage done on your part. Just...those damn tabloid hawks.&quot; he sounded 
uncomfortable.

Tifa stifled a laugh, &quot;No. I understood you, Cid. Relax.&quot;

&quot;Cid?&quot;

The woman turned with a start, her eyes resting on Yuffie, who stood in 
the doorway to the bathroom. She rubbed her wet hair with her towel, her 
gaze wary. &quot;What&#39;s he want?&quot; she asked.

Tifa held the phone toward her. &quot;Talk to him. He just wants to see how 
we&#39;re doing.&quot;

Yuffie crossed the room slowly, a small frown on her face. She took the 
phone with careful fingers, her eyelids lowered as her gaze darkened. 
&quot;What is it, Cid? I hope you aren&#39;t bugging about that wacked out 
magazine thing.&quot; The ninja&#39;s face soured, &quot;Hey, I didn&#39;t do anything 
like that! Quit being such a pervy lecher! Should you be talking like 
that when you&#39;ve got a daughter, now?&quot;

Tifa could hear Cid&#39;s shouted insults from where she sat.

Yuffie winced and held the phone slightly away from her ear. Her hand 
placed impatiently on her hip, the ninja quickly conceded. &quot;All right, 
all right! Geez, you smoking chimpanzee, I get it! I&#39;m, like, sorry to 
be rude or whatever, I know you didn&#39;t mean it that way...and hey-&quot; the 
ninja added, her eyes turning suspicious, &quot;What happened to not cursing 
anymore?&quot;

Tifa stifled a laugh behind her hand. Without thinking, Yuffie grinned 
at her.

&quot;Uh, huh,&quot; she said, nodding after a moment. &quot;Uh, huh...yeah. Look, 
we&#39;ll call him. Don&#39;t worry. I don&#39;t see what the big deal is. Anyways, 
yeah, I&#39;ll talk to ya later, you grumpy bastard.&quot; Yuffie handed the 
phone back to Tifa.

Tifa held the speaker up to her ear. &quot;Cid?&quot;

&quot;Tifa, tell Yuffie she&#39;s a pain in the ass.&quot;

The woman glanced at the ninja, then looked to the ground. &quot;You can tell 
her yourself when you see her again.&quot;

&quot;You gonna call Barret?&quot; the man asked. &quot;He&#39;s achin&#39; to hear from ya.&quot;

Tifa nodded, brushing her hair back with her hand. &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll get in 
contact with him, but not until morning...I&#39;m sorta tired. Today was 
pretty crazy.&quot;

&quot;All right...but you&#39;ll have to deal with his pissiness when you finally 
talk to him. He&#39;s like me. Thought you were leaving us in the dark. Only 
reason I&#39;m the only one calling you is cuz he doesn&#39;t want to go buggin&#39; 
you for answers you aren&#39;t willing to give on yer own.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure you can&#39;t call him for me?&quot;

&quot;Yep.&quot; was Cid&#39;s grunted response.

Tifa sighed, &quot;All right...it was good to hear from you anyways. I really 
hope this all works out all right.&quot;

&quot;For your sake and Yuffie&#39;s, I hope the same sweetheart.&quot; There was a 
click. The line went dead. Tifa hung up the phone.

&quot;I&#39;m taking a shower,&quot; she announced as she stood to her feet. Yuffie, 
who sat on her own bed now, gave her a distracted nod.

The fighter gazed at her for a brief moment before she went to get her 
things. In the bathroom, she felt the door shut behind her like a solid 
barrier. Dismayed at the sudden disconnection she felt, the woman 
stripped her clothing and stepped into the shower.

A short time later, she emerged, and after dressing back into her 
clothes, she came back into the hotel room, her gaze turned downward. 
Yuffie lay on the bed, her hands behind her head, and her eyes staring 
up at the ceiling. She sat up as Tifa went to her bed.

&quot;Hey,&quot; she said. She paused a moment. &quot;I wanted to say goodnight.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; was Tifa&#39;s bland reply. She bit her lip. &quot;...Goodnight, Yuffie.&quot;

Yuffie pulled at the corner of her blanket, and slipped in. &quot;&#39;Night.&quot; 
she returned.

Tifa&#39;s stomach clenched at the ninja&#39;s tone. Suddenly she seemed 
distant.

The woman slipped into her own bed, the sheets cold and unwelcoming. 
With a brief glance at Yuffie, the fighter shut off the light.

As Tifa laid her head on the pillow, she became aware of the silence 
that sat between them, strained and brittle to the point that the 
fighter feared breathing too loudly. A yearning rose in her to feel 
accepted, to feel understood, to feel loved. The dolorous emotion 
scratched at her heart, and her eyes burned.

&quot;Yuffie-&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Tifa blinked at the sudden remark.

The ninja&#39;s voice seemed choked, as if the phrase had fought its way to 
her tongue. Tifa raised herself onto her elbow and looked at the girl&#39;s 
form in the dark. She was curled with her back turned to the woman. Even 
in the shadow, Tifa could see the tension in the girl&#39;s body.

Yuffie continued, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to make you feel like you had to...&quot; 
her voice trailed away.

The fighter sat up all the way. Her gaze turned to her lap. &quot;Don&#39;t 
apologize to me.&quot; she said, her voice low. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have been so 
afraid.&quot;

&quot;Then there&#39;s no point in us being together, is there?&quot;

Tifa&#39;s heart gave a great wrench, and her head swiveled to stare at 
Yuffie fearfully. The ninja slowly sat up, her body slouched and her 
dark hair concealing her face. &quot;There&#39;s supposed to be a balance in a 
relationship. If the balance gets tipped then...&quot; she paused. Then she 
turned her head towards the door. &quot;Don&#39;t let me have my way, Tifa. I&#39;ll 
only consume you, then.&quot;

Tifa turned and placed her feet on the floor. &quot;Yuffie, please come 
here.&quot;

The ninja didn&#39;t move. &quot;I don&#39;t think I should...&quot; she mumbled.

&quot;...I need you to lay with me, this bed feels cold.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the best excuse you can think of?&quot;

&quot;Do you need a better one?&quot; Tifa&#39;s voice held no mirth. She gazed with 
somber eyes at Yuffie&#39;s quiet form, the yearning in her heart fueling 
her determination to end their sudden separation. &quot;Whatever you thought 
you did wrong...I don&#39;t care about it. I just need to know you want me.&quot; 
The woman swallowed a lump in her throat. &quot;Please tell me you want 
me...&quot; Her voice cracked as she said this.

At her plea, the ninja&#39;s eyes finally turned to meet Tifa&#39;s in the 
darkness. Slowly, she crept out of her bed and knelt in front of the 
fighter. She reached up and cupped the woman&#39;s face in her hand&#39;s. 
&quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous...&quot; she breathed, &quot;Of course I want you!&quot;

&quot;Then lay with me.&quot; Tifa whispered.

And Yuffie did.

Beneath the covers, both rested, their hearts beating together in sync. 
Yuffie&#39;s left arm draped over Tifa&#39;s waist, her knees touched the back 
of Tifa&#39;s knees, and her face buried in the fighter&#39;s hair. She breathed 
in deeply, filling herself with the one she had come to love. The one 
she had come to desire.

As sleep slowly came, the girl couldn&#39;t help but think the phrase over 
and over again:

&quot;I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you...&quot;

But added at the end each time came the question...

&quot;...Do I deserve you?&quot;
