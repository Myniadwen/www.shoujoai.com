- John Steinbeck

----------

A bright and sunny morning. Delicate observations brought to light 
changes in weather pattern. Thin strips of clouds streaked the sky like 
prison bars and a heady warmth carried on the soft breeze-humidity had 
gone up. A storm was approaching.

Roland&#39;s green pickled eyes lay shaded beneath his furrowed brow as he 
stood with broom in hand at the entrance to his clothing shop. He could 
see the horizon, the shimmer of the ocean beneath the glare of the sun. 
In his head, he imagined a world where confusion ruled and chaos 
threatened to destroy. ...He imagined the ones he loved caught in that 
struggle.

The wooden shop sign squeaked as it swung on its iron post, and it 
earned a look of annoyance from the startled young man.

Roland loved his store. He loved designing clothes and making people 
feel good about themselves. It was almost a compulsion on his part, to 
interact and to help. He knew this quality made him somewhat meddlesome 
and perhaps even a little pushy-like an IV needle shoved capriciously 
into a vein. Of the ones who made a difference and the ones who were the 
difference, Roland didn&#39;t care which he belonged.

So long as he belonged to something good.

&quot;Mason is like me. He wants to do what is best. I know he does.&quot; With a 
cursory sweep of the welcome mat set before the door, Roland turned to 
enter his store. A short sigh escaped his lips as his hand gripped the 
brass door knob, &quot;But sometimes I wonder if either one of us are making 
any progress at all.&quot;

He crossed the threshold as his hand gently began to close the door 
behind him. He heard the sign squeak again, and with an irritated click 
of the tongue, Roland glared back at it, a man besmirched. But the sign 
was still, and so was the breeze. Roland blinked and stepped back out 
onto the welcome mat, his long neck craning this way and that as he 
looked to see where the source of the sound was.

&quot;Roland! Roland!&quot;

The man stopped, his brows pressed together in great bafflement as the 
squeak became a harried hiss that slithered up from below. Without 
moving his head, the man entertained the notion that the ground was 
indeed talking, and let his gaze drop down to the street ahead of him. 
What he saw made him drop his jaw in an uncharacteristic show of 
ungracefulness.

&quot;Roland,&quot; Tifa said from beneath the barely lifted manhole covering, &quot;I 
know this is sort of...erm...absurd, but do you think you could come a 
little closer so that I don&#39;t have to talk so loud? It defeats the 
purpose of my being in here if I speak any higher...&quot;

Roland lifted a hand and pointed at the woman, whose face was largely 
shadowed save for the streak of light across her chocolate brown eyes. 
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; the man asked warily, uncertain of how to handle 
such an odd encounter. Anxiously, he looked around him, to see if anyone 
was watching.

&quot;Roland, I&#39;m serious, come closer! I don&#39;t have much time-&quot; Tifa hissed 
urgently.

&quot;Let me up! Let me up!! I can&#39;t breathe! My lungs aren&#39;t working!&quot;

The manhole shut with an abrupt clang and Roland started forward, 
alarmed. &quot;T-Tifa?&quot; he called uncertainly. He stopped at the edge of the 
sidewalk, his broom held worriedly with both hands, and crouched down as 
a muffled ruckus of yelps and shouts seeped through the holes of the 
manhole lid. Then, the lid popped open again, this time raised much 
higher with Yuffie squeezed on one side and Tifa squeezed on the other.

&quot;Oh gawd, thank you! AIR!!&quot; the teenager said with a relieved sigh. Her 
face was flushed and sweat plastered her hair to the sides of her face. 
Her arm shook as she supported one side of the manhole cover. Tifa, next 
to her, gave her a scandalized look, &quot;You didn&#39;t need to shove me, 
y&#39;know...&quot; she grumbled irately. Her arm held up her side of the lid 
steadily. &quot;I was going to let you up as soon as I saw everything was 
safe...&quot;

&quot;I cracked,&quot; Yuffie said with a weak and breathless voice, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, 
Rusty. The dark, the stench, the shut off tunnels...I thought I could 
make it but I couldn&#39;t. I just didn&#39;t want to say anything because-&quot;

&quot;-Because of Baxter, yeah,&quot; Tifa said with pursed lips, &quot;I know.&quot;

&quot;You still haven&#39;t answered my question, Tifa,&quot; Roland said as he rubbed 
his temple dubiously, &quot;What are you two girls doing!?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re on the lamb.&quot; Yuffie responded dryly as her dark eyes rolled to 
meet his.

Tifa shrugged wearily. &quot;I dunno if you&#39;ve heard, but we&#39;ve been outed by 
a tabloid newspaper. Apparently we&#39;re now in danger-&quot;

&quot;-From reporters and religious wack-jobs.&quot; Yuffie interjected.

&quot;So, uh...&quot; chagrined, the brunette bit her lip and looked to the side, 
&quot;So we&#39;re leaving the city.&quot;

&quot;With our tails in between our legs.&quot; the ninja added. Tifa elbowed her 
roughly. &quot;We were going to be going soon anyway,&quot; Yuffie amended 
sullenly.

Roland looked between the two of them with his eyebrow raised. &quot;And you 
need to travel by sewer in order to leave safely?&quot; he asked 
disbelievingly.

&quot;Something about a &#39;low-tech, low profile&#39; method.&quot; Tifa explained with 
another weary shrug. &quot;It was Reeve&#39;s idea.&quot;

&quot;Reeve? The engineer behind the restoration of-&quot;

&quot;Mideel and Midgar, yeah,&quot; Yuffie cut in unpleasantly. &quot;That nut case. 
He&#39;s a psychiatrist&#39;s wet dream.&quot;

&quot;He means well.&quot; Tifa said, her voice lacking confidence.

&quot;So this is good-bye then?&quot; Roland said, his expression genuinely 
disappointed.

Both women were lost in their own respective vexations when they heard 
the shop owner&#39;s melancholy tone. Both promptly discarded their problems 
in favor of comforting their new friend.

&quot;Hey, it&#39;s not like we can&#39;t visit!&quot;

&quot;Yeah! Roland, you&#39;ve been good to us, do you really think we&#39;d just 
never speak to you again?&quot;

&quot;Gawd you&#39;ve, like, been our personal guidance counselor or something.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d say more than a guidance counselor.&quot;

&quot;Oh, to-tally!! I mean, we wouldn&#39;t go out of our way through the city&#39;s 
sewer system just for ANY ol&#39; person!&quot;

Roland smiled gratefully and jovial wrinkles appeared at the corners of 
his eyes. He placed a hand warmly on his chest as he shouldered the 
broom stick with the other. &quot;That is sweet of you to say, ladies. It 
makes me feel so,&quot; he turned his head and his face grew ashen, &quot;DOWN!&quot; 
the man screamed frantically with a wild wave of his hand.

Yuffie and Tifa stared at him, confused for a moment before the sound of 
an automobile approaching reached their ears. The brunette grabbed the 
teenager by the shoulder and yanked her down as the lid crashed shut 
over them. In the shadows, both women heard the roar of a motor as the 
car passed and the manhole cover trembled twice as the wheels ran over 
it. Below, in the dark, Baxter covered his face in exasperation.

When the vehicle had gone, both Tifa and Yuffie&#39;s ears rang in the 
ensuing silence, their chests falling and rising in unison as they 
pressed their knees painfully into the ladder they stood on and pressed 
their shoulders into the cement wall behind them. In order to duck quick 
enough, the two had to crouch, but in their panic and cramped space, 
they nearly fell back down to the sewers from whence they came 
headfirst.

Yuffie was the first to speak. &quot;Tifa, I think I&#39;m gonna puke.&quot; the girl 
said weakly. The hot and foul air of the sewer made her head swim. She 
shut her eyes and tried to keep from retching.

&quot;Try and hold it in, Yuffie.&quot; the woman said, sounding equally as weak. 
&quot;Or I&#39;ll puke too.&quot;

&quot;Girls?&quot; Roland&#39;s voice drifted in from overhead. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re fine.&quot; Tifa called as she re-emerged. Yuffie followed her, her 
face a pale shade of green. &quot;That just scared us.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; the man said with a shaky voice, &quot;Really, though, isn&#39;t this a 
bit risky for you two? Coming all the way out here just to say goodbye 
to me?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what Baxter said, but I don&#39;t like him. So I don&#39;t care.&quot; Yuffie 
said contumaciously.

&quot;We were hoping to say goodbye to Mason as well,&quot; Tifa said, with an 
affectionate but equally exasperated look toward her love. &quot;Is he with 
you?&quot; she asked hopefully.

Roland opened his mouth as his light eyebrows pushed up and caused 
wrinkles along his forehead. At first it seemed he would speak, but then 
he shut his mouth again and averted his eyes to the ground with a shake 
of his head. &quot;No...no, no, sweetheart. I&#39;m afraid Mason&#39;s left town 
early this morning. An urgent business matter. Something dull like 
that...&quot;

&quot;Oh...&quot; Tifa&#39;s face fell in disappointment. &quot;I was really hoping to see 
him.&quot;

Yuffie quirked her eyebrow as a thought occurred to her, &quot;Say...did he 
tell you where he was going? We might see him!&quot;

Roland blinked and ran a hand through his strawberry blond hair. &quot;Ah, he 
didn&#39;t actually. I&#39;m afraid he didn&#39;t have time.&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t have time?&quot; The ninja said incredulously, &quot;But it only takes a-&quot; 
Tifa elbowed her again, this time with a pointed glare. Yuffie let out a 
grunt and tongued her cheek. &quot;I don&#39;t think a teacher would leave so 
suddenly like that for &#39;business&#39;...&quot; the girl muttered.

Roland frowned. &quot;Pardon?&quot;

Tifa cleared her throat. &quot;Uh...well, y&#39;see, Mason never told us what he 
did for a living, so me and Yuffie both took guesses as to what he does. 
I guessed he was a bartender, and she guessed he was a teacher.&quot; She 
quickly raised a hand and waved it frantically, &quot;Not that it&#39;s any of 
our business!&quot;

&quot;You mean he hasn&#39;t told you?&quot; Roland said with a blank look that seemed 
off-color for the spriteful young man.

&quot;No.&quot; Yuffie said with a shake of her head. &quot;He never told us.&quot;

The blond man bit his lip and rubbed his chin. His other hand, still 
holding the broom, rolled it back and forth on his shoulder as he 
thought. &quot;Well,&quot; he began, &quot;It&#39;s true that he used to be a bartender... 
I don&#39;t know about teaching formal classes, but he was a paid tutor for 
a time at a community center up on the Northern Continent, too.&quot;

&quot;And now?&quot; Yuffie pressed. &quot;What does he do now?&quot;

&quot;To be honest, even I&#39;m not sure.&quot; Roland said with a shrug, &quot;Not 
really.&quot;

&quot;But he&#39;s told you what his job is right?&quot; Tifa said with a tone of 
disbelief. &quot;I mean, you have to know! You both live under the same 
roof!&quot;

&quot;Well, yes. I have a vague idea.&quot; Roland said with a delicate gesture of 
his hand, &quot;I mean, he told me the title of his position and all of that. 
But it still eludes me just all the responsibilities that position 
entails. It&#39;s one big complex mess, you see.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; Yuffie said impatiently. &quot;What does he do, then?&quot;

Roland gave her a sympathetic smile, &quot;If he hasn&#39;t felt the need to tell 
you, dear, then I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Lame!&quot; The teenager exclaimed, her expression put-out. The man only 
chuckled in response.

A short, low whistle from the dark of the sewers made both girls look 
down. Tifa sighed and rubbed the back of her neck, &quot;Well, I guess this 
really is it then.&quot;

&quot;Yes, for the positions we&#39;re in at the moment, we really have stretched 
it on a bit haven&#39;t we?&quot; Roland said, once again looking downcast. 
&quot;We&#39;re lucky it&#39;s so early, or else we wouldn&#39;t manage this at all.&quot;

&quot;Roland, have you got a card or something? So we can call you?&quot; Yuffie 
asked.

The blonde&#39;s eyes lit up, &quot;Oh! As a matter of fact I do!&quot; He reached 
into his back pocket and procured a sleek silver card case from which he 
pulled out one card with a swipe, like a piece of gum. He held it out to 
Yuffie, who took it with a grin. &quot;Since you&#39;ve got that, I expect you to 
call me, Ms. Kisaragi.&quot;

The girl gave a shudder, &quot;Eyech! Don&#39;t call me that!&quot;

Tifa began to climb down the ladder, her eyes misty, &quot;Bye Roland.&quot;

Yuffie followed suit, and the manhole cover settled shut as they 
descended completely into the dark of the sewer system. Roland stared at 
the place where both girls had been for a long while before he stood and 
returned to his store. The sign squeaked obnoxiously as the door shut 
behind him.

----------

&quot;Yuffie, would you just quit being so stubborn and take my hand! 
Please!? You&#39;re unsteady, you&#39;re sick-&quot;

&quot;I said I&#39;m all right! I don&#39;t need help Tifa, I mean it.&quot;

&quot;Why are you being so pig-headed? You could hurt yourself, and-no 
offense-we could get through here faster if you&#39;d just take my hand!&quot;

&quot;NO!!&quot;

The shout echoed up and down the slimy walls of the dark sewer tunnel, 
punctuated only by the dull roar of overhead traffic. Her face shadowed 
and her hand still extended, Tifa felt her face grow hot and her jaw 
tighten. With a body that had become stiff, she turned and continued 
forward to where a silent Baxter stood with his stark white eyes glowing 
slightly in the darkness.

To their left was a wide current of bubbling sewage water. The odor it 
emitted filled the air, and the heat trapped by the walls made it thick 
and worse. The walk path they stood on was narrow and wet. It was 
difficult keeping steady for the sewer wall curved and forced them to 
duck some to prevent their heads being scraped. The small flashlights 
Baxter gave made it easier to see where one was going, but being able to 
see was only part of the problem. It was what made Tifa worried. It was 
what put Yuffie on edge.

The girl in question was at the rear of the three, and she stood rooted 
to the spot with a horrified expression on her face when she realized 
what she had done.

&quot;Tifa,&quot; the girl said weakly. Her face was green and words came on 
labored breath. With one hand insecurely keeping to the wall, Yuffie 
stumbled forward, her haste making her gait even more unsteady than 
before. Both Baxter and Tifa had already continued walking a few yards. 
&quot;Tifa, I&#39;m sorry!&quot; Yuffie called again, her brow pressed together in 
remorse. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to snap at you like that! I just, y&#39;know, I-I 
mean the whole thing, THIS whole thing, is really sort of...um...&quot; The 
girl gave a frustrated growl, &quot;Oh, GAWD!! It&#39;s like Hades cursed my 
tongue or something!&quot; When Tifa didn&#39;t stop or turn her head, Yuffie&#39;s 
head dropped, &quot;It&#39;s...it&#39;s just...it&#39;s everything,&quot; she said in a low 
voice. &quot;I can&#39;t take it. This couldn&#39;t have happened at a worse time.&quot;

Tifa finally came to a stop. Baxter, with a brief glance over his 
shoulder, and after he took a few steps forward, stopped as well. He 
muttered something under his breath and knelt to fish something out of 
one his large pant pockets. The fighter, with her moist eyes hidden by 
the dark, tried to seem as calm and unaffected as she could as she 
turned to face the girl behind her. &quot;Well I can&#39;t take it when you can&#39;t 
take it.&quot; she said, and managed a weak smile. &quot;So there.&quot;

Yuffie didn&#39;t smile back, she only bowed her head and sighed inwardly. 
&quot;I know,&quot; she thought to herself. &quot;And as much as I&#39;d like to keep that 
from being a problem, I&#39;m not sure I can.&quot;

&quot;Ladies.&quot; The rough voice came as a shock to both women, and they jumped 
in unison. Baxter, with his subtle smile, approached them.

&quot;Ifrit, can&#39;t you, like, not be a creep?&quot; Yuffie snapped, her patience 
once again depleted.

The man silently held up a small, black, square shaped pad. From it&#39;s 
surface, a pale-colored 3D projection blossomed. The technical map 
seemed to depict Costa Del Sol as a whole. With his glove back on, the 
special operative poked the image and it zoomed in to reveal a specific 
street, which Tifa immediately recognized. &quot;Hey!&quot; she exclaimed, 
pointing, &quot;That&#39;s where we first arrived in the city, as Avalanche! The 
ship port!&quot;

Baxter nodded. He poked the projection again, and it once again zoomed 
in to reveal the underground sewer system. A small glowing orb was 
located at the edge of the map. &quot;As you might guess, the red dot is us. 
Based on this scale, we&#39;re approximately half a mile from the port. The 
street we&#39;ll be re-emerging in is three blocks away from the guarded 
gate. The area past that gate is restricted, safe from all unauthorized 
personnel and civilians. Our boat is there.&quot;

&quot;Why can&#39;t we leave by plane?&quot; Tifa asked, her face falling, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t 
that be faster?&quot; She looked at Yuffie worriedly, whose lips went thin.

&quot;Believe it or not, it&#39;d be faster to go by boat.&quot; Baxter responded.

&quot;Well I don&#39;t believe it.&quot; Yuffie said contrarily. She approached them 
carefully along the walkway, then stopped and steadied herself against 
the wall. The ninja glared with great loathing at Baxter. &quot;Why couldn&#39;t 
Reeve get Cid to help?&quot; she asked.

&quot;And have him do what?&quot; Baxter asked, with a solid frown. &quot;Get in his 
airship and pick you up like a taxi? As if a flying behemoth in the sky 
isn&#39;t something to notice?&quot; The special operative shook his head with a 
small derisive snort. &quot;Highwind is the only man on the planet with a 
plane fast enough that can carry five people. He also happens to be one 
of the few Avalanche members left in the public eye. Now with all this 
journalistic chaos going on, don&#39;t you suppose that he&#39;ll be a little 
hard pressed to go anywhere? To do anything?&quot;

Tifa stared at him, affronted. That was the second time the soldier&#39;s 
professionalism had given way to crass attitude. Yuffie&#39;s jaw became 
visibly tight, and she snapped back before the fighter could even gather 
herself. &quot;You don&#39;t seem to like this job much, do you?&quot; She asked. The 
small quake in her face hinted toward a desire for violence. Tifa picked 
up on it, and with a worried expression, she placed her hands on the 
girls shoulders. &quot;Yuffie. Take it easy. This isn&#39;t the place to argue.&quot; 
she said quietly.

The ninja only craned to look around Tifa, her anger narrowing her 
capacity for reason. &quot;You hate babysitting us. You pompous, 
low-down,sleeze-ball. Quit with the brainwashed, &#39;Do as you&#39;re told,&#39; 
shtick. You suck at it. You&#39;ve been sucking at it since you first showed 
up on our balcony!&quot;

Baxter only gazed back at her, his blank white eyes like a dull beacon 
in the dark. He blinked once. Twice. Then turned and continued walking. 
&quot;If we keep losing time,&quot; he said without turning his head, &quot;Then all of 
this will be for nothing. I don&#39;t think either of us want that to be 
so.&quot;

Yuffie stumbled recklessly past Tifa, her unsteadiness worse with her 
growing agitation. Tifa, flabbergasted, moved out of the way, but 
reached out a hand to keep the girl from falling into the sewage water. 
She managed to catch Yuffie&#39;s right arm, but in the act, she lost grip 
of her flashlight, and it clattered into the foul stream of water. Even 
in her ill state, Yuffie&#39;s movements contained a burning ferocity that 
demanded immediate relent. Startled by it, the fighter obeyed without 
question.

&quot;Hey!&quot; the ninja snapped, her voice suddenly sharp with her anger as she 
glared at the dark, shrinking form of Baxter. &quot;Don&#39;t just walk away like 
that, jerk! I&#39;m still talking to you! HEY!!&quot; Though her face was covered 
in sweat, and nausea threatened to take her over, Yuffie bellowed as 
loud as she could with her stomach cradled and her spine curved. &quot;Come 
back here!! You yellow-streaked idiot! You think you&#39;re better than me? 
HUH!?&quot; She started to walk forward, her mind not on caution but 
retribution.

Tifa, her eyes wide, felt her grip on the girl&#39;s arm slowly slip away.

&quot;You&#39;re just a mindless tool, you hear me? You&#39;re a worthless toy 
soldier and I don&#39;t have to take any of your crap, you big-shouldered 
baboon! COME &#39;ERE!! You goddamn coward! You goddamn gun-totin&#39; ugly 
faced loser! I HATE YOU PEOPLE! You frickin&#39; soldiers, you&#39;re all just 
ants screwing around with peoples lives! But I&#39;m not a chump, you hear 
me? I&#39;m not a chump! You come back here! Get back here and fight me, you 
coward! I&#39;ll knock that weird face of yours inside out! Do you hear me? 
DO YOU HEAR ME!?&quot;

Tifa stood and stared at her. There was something frightening about 
Yuffie&#39;s fighting spirit. It was obstinate, reckless, and...unbearably 
open. Tifa had seen it before. Had seen it at least a few times in her 
life. When Yuffie had been kidnapped by Don Corneo, for instance, she 
had fought rabidly, tooth and nail, to be freed. At the time, the others 
had been mad at her, but even then, the fighter was disturbed at how 
desperate and unwieldy she had become. It were as if the very flames 
that made her what she was threatened to destroy her and everything 
around her.

Some nagging voice in the back of Tifa&#39;s head, however, said that she 
shouldn&#39;t be so uncomfortable with it. That it was a well known trait of 
the young ninja worldwide. But as the woman finally moved from where she 
stood, and hugged the ninja from behind with her lips against the girl&#39;s 
cold, damp neck whispering the words, &quot;Calm down. Relax. It&#39;ll be all 
right&quot;-the brunette thought with an anxious churn of her stomach, &quot;I 
never had her so close to me as she is now...&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;ve never been so close to the sun.&quot;

----------

Baxter was the first to head up the ladder toward the manhole, where 
morning light washed down in shafts through the ventilation holes and 
lit small spots of their upturned faces. He pulled himself up onto the 
street deftly, and his blond head turned this way and that in search of 
danger. When he stood fully out into the open and signaled for the two 
women to come up, Tifa turned to Yuffie and gestured toward the ladder. 
&quot;Go on. You first. I wanna make sure you climb up all right.&quot; she said.

Yuffie smiled weakly, her eyes shadowed in the dark. If the fighter 
could see them, she would have noticed the shame that haunted their 
gaze. &quot;Thanks, Rusty.&quot; Carefully, she began to climb up the ladder, and 
when she was up three steps, Tifa followed close behind.

The sudden light forced them both to squint their eyes. Baxter quickly 
replaced the sewer lid, and with a look at Tifa, who was next to him, he 
began to walk away. Ahead of him in the distance was the mentioned gate, 
two armed guards watching them with weapons aimed in preparation. The 
street was located in an area all ready separate from most of Costa Del 
Sol&#39;s activities. There were no businesses or homes here. Just pallid 
colored warehouses, left quiet and forgotten. No one came here without a 
purpose.

Baxter held up a badge of some sort that glinted with the sunlight. The 
soldier&#39;s apparently saw it through their scopes, for they lowered their 
weapons some.

Yuffie was doubled over next to the sidewalk, her duffel bag at her 
feet. She had just vomited onto the sidewalk. She gave a harsh cough and 
spat on the ground. With a shaky hand she wiped at her mouth, sweaty 
tendrils of hair blocking her face. Tifa, sighed as she approached the 
ninja with a sympathetic gaze. The brunette knew that the girl had 
over-exerted herself when she screamed after Baxter the way she did. 
Tifa could understand that the man was a bit disagreeable, but she 
wasn&#39;t sure why Yuffie disliked him so much. The teenager seemed testier 
than usual, and the fighter could guess that she was mostly the cause, 
despite their emotional &#39;reconciliation&#39; the night before-Reeve&#39;s 
attempt at help didn&#39;t improve matters either.

...But the level of loathing toward Baxter seemed gratuitous, even with 
all things considered.

On the other hand, Tifa thought, it had gradually been made clear that 
while Baxter planned on carrying out Reeve&#39;s orders, he didn&#39;t like it 
any more than Yuffie did. He could be unforgiving and caustic, which 
bothered the fighter as well, but to a lesser extent. Soldiers, 
especially those of higher position, tended to be that way. The woman 
had learned this long ago from her dealings with Shinra soldiers and 
Sephiroth. Baxter probably was exasperated with the entire thing, 
wondering why two world-renowned heroes couldn&#39;t handle something as 
infinitesimal as bad publicity. The more she thought about it, the more 
ridiculous it seemed to Tifa as well. &quot;But we&#39;ve sort of passed the 
point of no return,&quot; she thought wearily. &quot;To go back now could 
exacerbate things even further. Even Yuffie knows this. I know she 
does.&quot;

Tifa took Yuffie&#39;s duffel bag from the ground and slung it over her left 
shoulder. Then with her right arm crossed along the ninja&#39;s back, Tifa 
took hold of Yuffie&#39;s right side. &quot;Come on, love.&quot; Tifa breathed. She 
gently steered Yuffie toward the gate, where Baxter had all ready 
arrived and now conversed casually with the guards.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re going by boat,&quot; Yuffie rasped lowly. She leaned 
against Tifa as much for comfort as need. Her legs felt heavy and 
impotent. &quot;Did I ever tell you, Tifa?&quot; the girl said, with a glazed 
frown at Baxter, &quot;That I haven&#39;t gotten over my sea sickness yet?&quot;

Tifa ducked her head as she pulled Yuffie&#39;s left arm over her shoulders. 
&quot;No,&quot; she responded with a shake of her head. &quot;So the bike riding hasn&#39;t 
cured that yet, huh?&quot;

&quot;Not a bit.&quot; the girl snorted, &quot;Y&#39;know my entire heritage, my entire 
culture, is based on living in harmony with the ocean. Isn&#39;t that lousy? 
I can&#39;t even go on a fishing boat a mile off shore without ralfing.&quot; 
Yuffie gave a sardonic laugh. Tifa winced at the sound of it. &quot;Why did 
we accept his help, Rusty?&quot; the girl asked, her glassy eyes still fixed 
on Baxter. &quot;What do we need that dopey knucklehead for?&quot; The man in 
question turned and gazed back, his face solemn. Behind him the gate to 
the port opened.

Tifa&#39;s brows pressed together as the glint and glitter of the ocean was 
made clear to her from where she and Yuffie approached. &quot;I don&#39;t know, 
Yuffie.&quot; the woman whispered, &quot;Maybe because we aren&#39;t the heroes 
anymore?&quot;

The girl&#39;s head turned slightly away at this remark, and the fighter 
felt her spirit sink as the fear set in that she may have upset Yuffie 
further.

Quietly the two, like an awkward loping creature, followed Baxter as he 
proceeded to lead them toward one of the docked boats. The boat he 
stopped at looked to be a fishing trawler. Printed along the back in 
bold but curvaceous letters was the name, &quot;Severe Whisper.&quot; It was wide, 
the top of the boat a good thirteen feet from the water. The bow raised 
high into the air, proud and pristine. The ship was new. Two people, a 
man and a woman, were busy with preparations toward the forward part of 
the deck when they neared.

The man was the first to look up. He had ruddy brown hair that was 
overgrown and limp. His round and young freckled face brightened from 
its look of concentrated somberness when he saw Baxter. He straightened 
and gave a respectful nod, the baggy sleeve of his burgundy sweater 
falling to the crook of his arm as he did so. &quot;Sir, it&#39;s good to see you 
back in one piece.&quot; he said with a mirthful grin. His voice was tinged 
with a lyrical quality that befitted the alacrity in his tone.

The woman straightened as well and gave the same respectful nod toward 
Baxter. &quot;Sir.&quot; she said. Her voice was low and scratchy, as if from lack 
of use. Tifa, noted with a small shudder that the female soldier also 
had odd eyes, as if a soul were absent behind their azure stare and 
hungrily sought a replacement. Her mocha shaded skin seemed golden with 
the morning sun, and her long inky black hair rivaled Tifa&#39;s. The 
fighter avoided making eye contact.

Baxter turned to Yuffie and Tifa. &quot;Henley and Lenna,&quot; he said, first 
indicating toward the man than the woman. &quot;Henley is our tech man. He 
invented the device I used to navigate my way back. He&#39;ll be working 
with our people on the Eastern Continent to create a secure route 
through Junon. ...He&#39;ll also be sailing the boat for most of the time.&quot;

&quot;Hello,&quot; Henley said, his friendly smile odd and incongruent given the 
situation.

&quot;Lenna,&quot; Baxter continued in his rough voice, &quot;Is our medic.&quot;

The woman didn&#39;t say anything. She only stared at Yuffie and Tifa.

Baxter crossed his arms and his eccentric smile spread across his slim 
face. &quot;She&#39;s also our extra muscle.&quot;

&quot;Super.&quot; Yuffie said lowly. &quot;Can we hurry and get this show on the road? 
The less time I spend you with you crazies the better...&quot;

&quot;Let me show you where you&#39;ll both be sleeping,&quot; The special operative 
said as he walked up the loading ramp to the boat. Both women followed 
him. Tifa had to let Yuffie&#39;s side go and settled for just holding her 
hand, for the sides of the boat&#39;s cabin were no better than a catwalk. 
Stern-side, Tifa and Yuffie entered the interior through the two doors 
Baxter went through. Inside, the ceiling was five inches from their 
heads, and the space of the cockpit seemed oddly spacious considering 
how small it looked outside.

Baxter knelt on the floor and lifted a hatch that revealed a small 
ladder to the boat&#39;s small sleeping quarters below. &quot;It isn&#39;t a boat 
meant for long-term use,&quot; the man explained, his pale gaze turned up to 
their faces. &quot;Our trip to Junon will take two days at most. All of 
today. All of tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;ll we eat?&quot; Tifa asked.

&quot;Packaged food. We&#39;ve also got a microwave up here,&quot; he pointed to a 
space next to him. Tucked in a corner was a small fridge and next to it 
a cabinet with a microwave on the counter. Baxter pointed to the two 
doors at either side of Tifa and Yuffie. &quot;The door to your right is a 
storage closet. We keep some of our equipment and supplies there. The 
door to your left is the head.&quot;

&quot;The head?&quot; Tifa asked, puzzled. In the back of her mind she noted that 
Yuffie failed to make a quip or remark about the term, which was out of 
sorts for the girl. She glanced nervously at her from the corner of her 
eye.

&quot;The toilet.&quot; Baxter said as he rose. He pointed down. &quot;You can store 
your things in the containers above and below the cots. Don&#39;t leave your 
items lying around. The waves will knock them around.&quot;

&quot;And Yuffie&#39;s bike?&quot; Tifa felt the weight of the conversation with 
Yuffie&#39;s silence. She wished the girl would say something. She didn&#39;t 
like being the only one dealing with Baxter and his team. &quot;We left it at 
the inn.&quot;

&quot;We had to leave it in order to keep from arousing suspicion, but we can 
send someone to get it if you&#39;d like.&quot;

&quot;Um, yeah, that&#39;d be good.&quot;

&quot;I suggest shipping it somewhere other than Junon. You can&#39;t take that 
out of the city without bringing the media down on your head. We can 
send it to another coastal city, and have it arrive at Olus, which is an 
inland town South-East of Junon. You can pick it up there.&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot; Tifa glanced at Yuffie, who said nothing. She was busy staring 
down the hatchway to the place they would be sleeping. The fighter 
sighed, &quot;Yeah. That&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

&quot;She doesn&#39;t look good.&quot; Baxter stated, with a nod toward the ninja.

&quot;No...Is there anything Lenna can do for her?&quot;

&quot;She can take some Dramamine.&quot;

The fighter jumped slightly and turned her head. Lenna stood behind her, 
hands over the door as she leaned in. Her eyes bored into Tifa&#39;s 
disconcertingly. &quot;It&#39;ll put her to sleep within the hour.&quot; she shrugged, 
&quot;Aside from that, there isn&#39;t much to do.&quot;

&quot;F-Fine.&quot; The woman said, perturbed. She looked back at Baxter, her 
nerves thin. &quot;When are we casting off?&quot;

&quot;Few minutes.&quot; he leaned to the side and raised an eyebrow at Lenna. 
&quot;Right?&quot;

The female soldier nodded mutely. She brushed past the two women at the 
door and headed toward the fridge, where she knelt and looked inside.

Tifa set Yuffie&#39;s duffel bag down. &quot;Do you want to try and lie down?&quot; 
she asked the girl, her gaze anxious.

&quot;I wanna go outside.&quot; Yuffie said faintly. &quot;It&#39;s worse in here.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; Tifa said with a heavy sigh. &quot;Do you need me to walk you out 
there?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

The curt reply made the fighter wince and turn away. &quot;Um, all right. 
I&#39;ll just put our bags away, okay?&quot; Without looking at the ninja, the 
fighter dropped down into the hatchway. In the sleeping quarters, she 
found the space was dark and cold. Tifa rose and moved forward two 
steps. After that she stopped and let her chin drop to her chest.

Yuffie stared with dark-ringed eyes at the place where the older woman 
disappeared.

She did it again. She didn&#39;t mean to.

Her head swam and she felt her throat tense as bile fought to reach her 
mouth. Like a drunk person, the girl stumbled out of the cabin toward 
the stern and vomited again. Baxter watched her from his place inside 
the ship. His white eyes lowered to the ground before he turned and sat 
himself in the navigator&#39;s chair.

Yuffie felt her chest throb as she leaned against the guard rail.

&quot;Here.&quot;

The ninja turned her head and saw Lenna behind her with her hand held 
out. &quot;The Dramamine You&#39;ll go to sleep fast with this. You should 
probably go back inside and lie down.&quot;

&quot;And you should probably forget it.&quot; Yuffie returned, her usual bite of 
insult subdued by her sickness. &quot;I&#39;m staying here.&quot;

Lenna shrugged. The girl held up her hand and Lenna dropped the white, 
oval shaped pills into her palm. The soldier then walked away without 
another word.

Sullenly, the girl dry swallowed the pills and leaned against the rail 
completely.

A heavy breeze ruffled Yuffie&#39;s hair. She recognized it immediately and 
shut her eyes. The clear skies did nothing. The sun was no ward. Rain 
would come over them soon. Within the day, most likely. Storm clouds, 
when caught in a fervent, knew no restraints. For all her waywardness, 
Yuffie knew this. The people of Wutai were children of the storm. They 
had been born from the furious waves of Leviathan, the almighty sea god, 
and sensed rather than saw the approach of one of His tantrums.

But she was ill and she was lost.

Her sense was dulled. Perhaps if she had been given a better opportunity 
to realize things earlier that morning, she could&#39;ve avoided this trip 
and opted for air travel instead. She still got sick in planes, but 
planes were quicker and didn&#39;t throw her off as much. As it stood, she 
was stuck with heading East by boat.

&quot;Babe, you&#39;re toast. ...Darn it, you&#39;re toast!&quot; the ninja said miserably 
to herself.

----------

Tifa massaged her temples, subdued and strangely comforted by the pitch 
black that curtained around her body. She felt it coat her skin, like an 
exoskeleton. A defense.

&quot;My little defense.&quot; she breathed.

&quot;Are you talking to yourself?&quot;

Tifa looked up with a jerk of her head, her eyes wide as she saw Henley 
stick is head through the hatch. &quot;Wha-? Oh. Yeah. Sort of.&quot;

The man grinned his odd grin. &quot;Dark&#39;ll do it to ya. Y&#39;know there&#39;s a 
light switch over-&quot;

&quot;Yeah. I know. Thanks.&quot;

&quot;All right. Just trying to be of help.&quot; he slipped out of view, then 
ducked back down again. &quot;Oh! Hey! Geez, I forgot. Your sweetheart is up 
on deck still, and she doesn&#39;t look like she&#39;s going to move. She should 
probably come in and try and rest all ready. Waves are getting a bit 
choppy outside and wind&#39;s picking up. That drug should start kicking in 
soon. She won&#39;t have the strength to hold on.&quot; He sucked in air 
resignedly as he rubbed his neck. &quot;I&#39;d get her myself, but she 
threatened to steal my family jewels if ya know what I mean...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll get her.&quot; Tifa said as she rose quickly. &quot;I was afraid she&#39;d do 
this. Her fear of closed in spaces is making her stay outside.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s claustrophobic?&quot;

The fighter looked up into the man&#39;s face. &quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Holy smokes, didn&#39;t know that one!&quot;

&quot;Uh, huh...hey, can you move? I can&#39;t get out while you&#39;re there.&quot;

&quot;Whoops, sorry about that...here lemme...&quot; The man pulled back up and 
Tifa climbed the ladder to the main cabin. &quot;Thanks.&quot; she said. She 
turned and went out onto the deck.

At the bow of the trawler, Yuffie hung pitifully over the edge, her face 
pale and her eyes distant as they watched the the slate-colored ocean. 
The girl shut her eyes and tried to squeeze some comfort from the gusts 
of wind. They were frigid and heavy. A cold front.

&quot;Leviathan...did I anger you?&quot; she asked quietly of the sharp crests of 
waves that crashed and swirled about the hull of the boat. Rain droplets 
began to splatter the top of her head. Listlessly, the ninja&#39;s eyes 
rolled up toward the sky.

&quot;Yuffie!&quot;

The teenager turned her head slowly in the direction of the voice with 
her face turned down, as if her neck found it hard to support the 
weight.

Tifa gazed at her worriedly from her place near the cabin. &quot;Yuffie, come 
inside. It isn&#39;t going to be safe up here once the storm kicks in full 
swing.&quot;

&quot;I feel better out here.&quot; Yuffie rasped, barely audible over the roar of 
the wind. &quot;I don&#39;t feel trapped out here.&quot;

Tifa gave her a sympathetic look, &quot;I know, sweet heart.&quot; she came 
closer, her arms held out, &quot;But the pill Lenna gave you is all ready 
taking effect. You can barely hold yourself up now, don&#39;t you see? We 
can sleep until morning. You&#39;ll feel better then.&quot;


Yuffie lifted her head higher and gave Tifa a look so 
uncharacteristically despondent that the fighter&#39;s heart wrenched and 
she immediately swept the girl into her embrace. &quot;I can&#39;t get up,&quot; The 
ninja managed to say. &quot;I need...help...&quot; Tifa slung the girl&#39;s arm over 
her shoulders and with her other hand gripping her waist, hefted Yuffie 
from the floor of the deck. &quot;I need help getting up, Rusty...&quot; the ninja 
said quietly.

&quot;It&#39;s the sea sickness. You might be suffering from a bit of vertigo 
along with your nausea...&quot; Tifa said. She recalled how Aeris, once long 
ago, had helped the ninja with her illnesses. Dredging up her memory of 
how the gentle healer had taken care of the matter, she carried her 
lover down to the cabin. &quot;You won&#39;t suffer much longer.&quot;

Inside, Tifa laid her down on their cot gently. The girl seemed to pour 
onto the mattress like liquid, her body weak and her limbs too uncertain 
of their environment to provide any stable support. Yuffie let out a 
rush of air, her eyes rolling into the back of her head as another wave 
of nausea rushed over her. She rolled toward the wall and hugged 
herself, as if trying to protect herself from some outside influence. 
Tifa sat on the edge of the bed as her teeth bit into her lower lip.

&quot;I hate this space.&quot; Yuffie said quietly, her eyes covered by her hair. 
&quot;It makes it a little harder to breathe...&quot;

Tifa sighed heavily and reached her hand over to brush the girl&#39;s hair 
away from her face. &quot;I know, Yuffie.&quot; The woman took the blanket from 
beneath the pillow and laid it over the ninja. She then scooted further 
onto the bed and laid back onto it, her right arm propping up her head 
as her feet dangled off the edge of the cot. She rubbed Yuffie&#39;s arm, 
which felt cold. &quot;Is it okay if I lay with you?&quot; she asked tentatively. 
She sensed some distance between herself and the girl, and feared making 
things worse by encroaching on the girl&#39;s need for independence. It made 
the fighter anxious and depressed.

Yuffie didn&#39;t answer for a moment. Tifa wondered if that invisible line 
had been crossed and the girl would shut her out in favor of salvaging 
her wounded pride. &quot;This entire situation has turned out to be a 
nightmare for her. And her being sick doesn&#39;t help.&quot; Tifa thought, her 
eyes turning downcast. &quot;I don&#39;t want her to feel like she&#39;s failed. I 
don&#39;t want her to feel like it&#39;s out of her hands. ...And I don&#39;t want 
her to feel like she&#39;s alone in this. But how do I do that if she 
doesn&#39;t trust me to help? If that&#39;s the case, then maybe I&#39;m no real 
help at all?&quot;

Then Yuffie rolled onto her back, her gaze lidded and her breathing 
deep. She was all ready beginning to feel the affects of sleep. Her mind 
doing turns, the girl mumbled, &quot;Hold me?&quot;

Tifa, with a long warm smile, leaned forward and kissed the girl&#39;s brow 
as her other arm came to pull Yuffie close to her. The girl snuggled 
close, her eyes falling shut at the feel of the fighter&#39;s embrace. 
&quot;...Thank you.&quot; she said. &quot;These close walls...freak me out...&quot; she 
buried her face into Tifa&#39;s neck, and the woman squeezed her tenderly. 
&quot;If...I&#39;m going to be...crushed...let it be by something...I...like...&quot; 
Yuffie&#39;s voice trailed away.

Tifa closed her eyes, waves of joy rolling over her that her attempts at 
comfort were not rejected. The girl had been on the verge of sleep for a 
time. Now that she had allowed herself to relax, the exhaustion that had 
haunted since early morning came to claim its body. The fighter, as the 
boat rocked and the sound of rain thundering on the deck rang about her, 
found herself headed toward the same path. Quietly and with her mind on 
simpler things than scandal and social decadence, Tifa fell asleep.

----------

When the fighter woke again it was to the sound of a pen being scratched 
on paper. A light across from Tifa and Yuffie&#39;s cot burned, and threw 
shadows along the wall. Groggy and a little sore from the stiff 
mattress, she turned her head to see who it was.


Lenna looked up at her, her azure gaze illuminated by the small flash 
light clipped onto the clipboard she wrote on. A slim silver pen in her 
hand, she halted her writing. &quot;Did I wake you?&quot; she asked.

Tifa shook her head quietly. &quot;No, s&#39;okay...&quot; she propped herself up on 
her elbow and looked down at Yuffie, who was deep in sleep. With her 
hand, she gently traced the side of the girl&#39;s face, and her eyelids 
fell half-shut. &quot;I wish she could stay this way...&quot; the woman whispered, 
more to herself.

&quot;It&#39;s been an ordeal, hasn&#39;t it?&quot; Lenna asked her.

Tifa turned her head slightly, her eyes still on Yuffie. &quot;It&#39;s been 
rough.&quot; she replied quietly. The ship rolled over a particular high 
wave. The ninja&#39;s body pressed against hers, and the woman held her 
closer as she pressed her lips against the girl&#39;s head. Yuffie stirred 
slightly, her hands gripping at the front of Tifa&#39;s shirt and her face 
nuzzled her neck. Perhaps she had become lucid for a moment, for she 
mumbled against the woman&#39;s skin before she quieted again. Tifa sighed 
and laid her head back so that she stared at the cot above them. The 
mattress over head had sunk in somewhat. Someone was asleep above. Most 
likely it was Baxter.

Lenna watched all this, the tip of her pen at her lips. &quot;I like watching 
couples.&quot; she said suddenly. &quot;They seem good. Like fun.&quot;

Tifa, with a small frown, twisted her upper body to properly stare at 
the female soldier. &quot;Pardon?&quot;

The other woman tilted her head and stared up at the ceiling. &quot;I find it 
hard to relate sometimes.&quot; she shrugged. &quot;That&#39;s all.&quot; She pointed at 
her paper with her pen. &quot;I&#39;ve got a doctor who tells me to write things 
down. Ideas I get.&quot; She grinned, but it seemed off somehow, like she 
were only doing it for the purpose of communicating an idea. &quot;I think 
this one sounds right.&quot;

Tifa blinked. &quot;Um...you have to see a doctor?&quot; Chills went up the 
woman&#39;s skin. She resisted the urge to shiver, despite the warmth she 
received from Yuffie and the blanket over her legs.

Lenna looked at her. Tifa sat up stiffly. &quot;Didn&#39;t I just say I did?&quot; the 
soldier said. She tapped her pen against her chin. &quot;Y&#39;know, this mission 
was really dull. Normally our jobs are more exciting, but I can&#39;t say 
this was very fascinating...You really didn&#39;t need us at all, I don&#39;t 
think.&quot;

Tifa shrugged, her gaze wary. &quot;Maybe not.&quot; she replied.

&quot;You don&#39;t seem as upset as your partner.&quot;

&quot;Well, I am upset. But...I don&#39;t know. I think this whole running away 
thing makes Yuffie feel ashamed. And,&quot; the woman tugged anxiously at her 
ear, &quot;Well let&#39;s just say I might&#39;ve put her in a sour mood before 
hand.&quot;

Lenna nodded, then pointed at Tifa. &quot;So...it&#39;s your fault she&#39;s such a 
mess?&quot;

The fighter first nodded her head, then did a double take. &quot;Wait, what? 
No! I mean, well, not entirely!&quot; she slumped. &quot;I guess...&quot;

&quot;Your uncertainty doesn&#39;t make sense.&quot; Lenna said matter-of-factly. She 
circled something on her paper.

&quot;Just what do you have to see a doctor for, anyway?&quot; Tifa asked, sore at 
Lenna&#39;s obtrusive judgment. &quot;You say you find it hard to relate, but 
that could mean a lot of things. I&#39;d think that soldiers, especially 
those working in such a delicate field as you do, would have to be 
mentally sound.&quot;

&quot;I am mentally sound.&quot;

&quot;So why the doctor?&quot;

&quot;Because a part of my brain was cut away by Hojo&#39;s scientists when I was 
sixteen years old. My capacity for fear, anger, and happiness was taken 
out of my skull forever.&quot; Lenna made another scribble on her paper, her 
tone casual and uninterested as if she had explained her situation 
hundreds of times. Tifa&#39;s face, meanwhile, went slack with shock. Of all 
the answers received from na&#139;ve questions, years down the line, she 
would rank that as one of the most harrowing.

&quot;They captured me during a skirmish at Fort Condor,&quot; Lenna went on to 
say. &quot;Environmentalists and Shinra troops never did get along, so I 
doubt the reason for the conflict was very big. My mother, father, and 
older sister were taken to a prison in Junon and were charged as 
terrorists. They were executed one by one. I was the next to be killed 
when an executive order came from Midgar that I was to be sent alive to 
Shinra HQ. Apparently I was the youngest prisoner the company had at the 
time and they wanted to use me for an experimental study. Something 
about the stage of my brain development made me a prime candidate. 
Details elude me even now, I&#39;m afraid.&quot; She gave a noncommittal shrug.

&quot;...I&#39;m always asked how it is that I can continue living-and I cannot 
say that Shinra&#39;s experiments did not leave something to be desired, I 
suppose-but how do you miss what you feel you&#39;ve never had?&quot; Lenna shook 
her head, &quot;Because of what was done to me, I can&#39;t even remember what it 
was like to have emotions. I remember being like everyone else, but the 
actual concept of feeling is beyond my capacity to recall. It would be 
like...&quot; Lenna paused and her gaze turned upward. &quot;...Like trying to 
explain to a person born blind what &#39;colors&#39; are.&quot; She nodded. &quot;Exactly 
like that.&quot; The soldier continued writing on her paper, unaware or 
uncaring of the effect she had had on her listener.

Tifa sat rigid in her place, now no longer from fear of Lenna, but of 
horror for what had been done to her. &quot;Oh Shiva...I didn&#39;t...&quot; she 
turned her head and stared at her hands, as if some blame lay tainted in 
the folds of her palms. &quot;I didn&#39;t know Hojo did anything like that...as 
far as I knew he was only interested in Jenova-&quot;

&quot;Oh he was,&quot; Lenna explained, and her pen once again halted. She looked 
at Tifa with another fixed smile. &quot;But after the incident with 
Sephiroth, President Shinra ordered for Hojo to look into ways to 
prevent that from happening again. He wanted the chaos variable removed 
completely from the equation. Jenova inflicted madness, and madness 
largely affects emotion. Take away emotion, and the fire that fuels 
chaos simply becomes a new perception on things-and that is easily 
controlled.&quot; Lenna shrugged, &quot;But Professor Hojo wasn&#39;t very interested. 
That&#39;s why he never dealt with me directly. I think he admired and 
adored Jenova just as it was, and didn&#39;t want to change it&#39;s way of 
function.&quot;

&quot;But did they inject you with Jenova&#39;s cells?&quot; Tifa asked, her eyes wide 
and her skin pale. She imagined Lenna, as old as Yuffie when the fighter 
first met her, trapped and violated inhumanely. Unnerved at some 
people&#39;s capacity for evil, the brunette hugged herself.

&quot;They were going to, but Hojo&#39;s specimen hunters captured a new 
plaything shortly before the procedure. It was something his small staff 
couldn&#39;t resist-a creature of an undocumented species. Hojo called him 
Red XIII. You knew him as Nanaki. Because of him, the injection was put 
off.&quot;

&quot;Nanaki...&quot; Tifa breathed. It occurred to her that none of the team had 
ever asked exactly how long their friend had been held captive by 
Shinra, or exactly what had been done to him. It had gone unsaid that 
what had happened was never to be inquired about. Whenever the proud 
beast happened to mention his time there, it was with hackles raised and 
fangs bared. Tifa didn&#39;t consider, or perhaps did not wish to consider, 
the horrors Nanaki had faced while imprisoned by Hojo.

&quot;At any rate, in the brief time of distraction, I was able to escape 
thanks to a lab assistant and a soldier.&quot; She pointed up at the cot over 
Tifa and Yuffie&#39;s. &quot;Baxter. He used to be with Shinra, but when he saved 
me he deserted the military and we escaped to the Northern Continent.&quot;

&quot;And the lab assistant?&quot;

&quot;She was discovered and killed.&quot; Lenna said. She tapped her pen once on 
the clipboard, then wrote a small note at the top of her paper.

Tifa stared up at the cot over them, surprised at this revelation and 
sorely wishing Yuffie had been awake to hear it. Perhaps if the ninja 
realized this side of the man, she wouldn&#39;t despise him so?

&quot;So Reeve knows about your condition?&quot; the woman asked the female 
operative, her face now somber and respectful.

Lenna nodded. &quot;Yes. He&#39;s actually paying neurologists to see if they can 
help me somehow. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible. That science is beyond our 
present capabilities, and I doubt I&#39;ll see it achieved in my lifetime.&quot;

&quot;You never know. Things could turn out well.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s to say they&#39;re so bad now? I think my life is interesting.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t tell me how it was you get by without being able to feel 
anymore. What keeps you going from day to day?&quot;

&quot;Not being bored.&quot;

Tifa stared at her. Lenna glanced at her with a quirked eyebrow. &quot;I mean 
it,&quot; she said. &quot;While I may not feel anything, my mind still works. My 
body still functions. I try to keep myself preoccupied at all times. In 
down time, I play puzzles and video games. They keep my reflexes sharp. 
When I&#39;m not doing that, I write. I&#39;ve observed lots of things since I 
escaped Shinra, and have viewed great dilemmas as one truly impartial. I 
figure I could write a book about my ideas and realizations some day. I 
think that&#39;d be fascinating.&quot;

&quot;And so one of the things you think interesting are couples?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you recall what it&#39;s like to love, then! Maybe seeing others 
together makes you happy?&quot;

Lenna shrugged, &quot;I&#39;ve come to find that perhaps, in my own way, I know 
something of happiness and love...but not in the ways you define it. I 
don&#39;t feel things that way anymore.&quot;

&quot;Then how is it that you&#39;ve remained with Baxter this long? Maybe you 
actually love him?&quot;

&quot;It has been mostly through his efforts that we&#39;ve remained together as 
long as we have. I don&#39;t know what it would be like without him...but 
the idea of him not being near me doesn&#39;t really bother me. I&#39;m not sure 
if that is because of my condition, or because I really don&#39;t feel I 
need Baxter.&quot; Lenna leaned back against the wall as her eyes turned 
glassy. &quot;I never considered that.&quot; the woman said in a low voice.

&quot;Oh...&quot; Tifa said, as she leaned forward onto her bent knees. She was 
afraid she may have inspired a negative idea in the soldier&#39;s head. She 
tried to think of how to correct this mistake when Yuffie stirred again 
next to her. The ninja gave a small shiver and curled toward Tifa&#39;s 
body, seeking her warmth. The woman stroked the girl&#39;s hair. &quot;I can&#39;t 
believe that happened to you. I didn&#39;t even know that something like 
that was possible...&quot; the woman shook her head, her gaze dark. &quot;Even 
with Shinra gone and Jenova destroyed, their legacy echoes on around us 
like an invidiouswraith...&quot; the woman hissed beneath her breath.

Lenna looked at her, her eyes wide. &quot;Hey, that&#39;s really good.&quot; she 
pointed at her paper. &quot;Can I write that down?&quot;

Tifa blinked and stared at her, her cheeks pink. &quot;Um...&quot; she scratched 
her head, &quot;You really want to? I was only thinking out loud.&quot;

&quot;But it sounded nice. &#39;Invidious&#39; is a good word.&quot;

&quot;For some reason Jenova reminded me of it...because it was a big veiny 
monster, and the &#39;vidious&#39; part of &#39;invidious&#39; sorta sounds like 
&#39;veins&#39;...I guess. Don&#39;t you think it does??&quot; The fighter looked at 
Lenna uncertainly, her brows pressed together in confusion.

Lenna stared at her.

&quot;...Can I write down what you said or not?&quot;

----------

&quot;Wake up.&quot;

Tifa felt a hand shake her. She sucked in air sharply, annoyed that her 
rest was once again disturbed. After Lenna and Tifa&#39;s conversation 
finished, the soldier had gone up to the cabin above to relieve Henley 
of his post and allow the man time to rest. Not interested in speaking 
anymore, the fighter had gone back to sleep. At the present, she wasn&#39;t 
sure what time it was or how long it had been since she last had been 
awake.

Groggily, the fighter squinted her eyes at the blurred face that peered 
down at her. The light in the sleeping quarters had been turned on. Tifa 
rubbed at her eyes, in an attempt to clear them. &quot;Wuzgoinon?&quot; the 
fighter mumbled.

&quot;It&#39;s been twelve hours. You need to eat. Ms. Kisaragi too if she gets 
up.&quot; The fighter&#39;s eyes opened again, and she was able to make out 
Baxter as he turned to leave. He still wore his special white contacts, 
which Tifa thought strange.

&quot;Mm&#39;kay.&quot; She turned to her side and looked at the ninja. The girl 
didn&#39;t seem any closer to waking. Careful the fighter disentangled 
herself and turned off the lights. She used the ladder to ascend to the 
main cabin, where the others were seated and all ready eating. Henley 
sat in the navigator&#39;s chair with a cup of coffee in one hand and a 
bagel egg sandwich in the other. Bits of egg littered the floor around 
him. Baxter leaned against the counter near the hatch a bowl of oatmeal 
in his hands. Lenna sat in a low cushioned chair in the corner next to 
the closet. She ate toast with jam. Outside, through the windows, the 
fighter could see the rain had stopped.

&quot;Morning.&quot; Tifa said as she shut the hatchway carefully. The others 
mumbled responses, preoccupied with their meals.

Henley pointed at the microwave and cupboards. &quot;We&#39;ve got bread, 
microwavable stuff, and coffee. Help yourself!&quot;

Tifa nodded, her hunger suddenly voracious. She knelt next to the 
cupboard and opened it. Inside on the first shelf were plastic bowls, 
plates, and cups. The second shelf held boxes and bags of microwavable 
goods, as Henley said. And at the bottom shelf there was the toaster, 
bread, and coffee mugs. &quot;The mugs are on the bottom,&quot; Tifa noted aloud.

&quot;To keep them from breaking,&quot; Lenna answered, now eating a banana. 
&quot;Sometimes things fall out of the shelves, even when we keep them 
secured with racks and tie the cupboards shut.&quot; she gestured toward 
Henley. &quot;He doesn&#39;t know how to tie a proper knot.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Baxter said, with a glance at Henley. &quot;How&#39;d you get into our 
division if you can&#39;t even manage a proper knot?&quot;

Henley, who was about to sip his coffee, lowered his hand and made an 
indignant noise with his tongue. &quot;I know how to tie knots, all right 
fellas?&quot; Suddenly he screwed up his face in confusion. &quot;But y&#39;know...I 
never got how ship cook&#39;s managed to keep all their stuff all right. How 
d&#39;you figure they manage in a storm? You can&#39;t tie it all down...can 
you?&quot;

&quot;Maybe they do.&quot; Lenna said with a shrug. &quot;Maybe they actually know how 
to tie knots.&quot;

&quot;Why do you care?&quot; Baxter asked the man, &quot;You don&#39;t have to cook.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean!? I get the coffee done and make that toast you like 
so much...AND I keep the cupboard lookin&#39; neat!&quot; he looked to Tifa and 
jerked his chin toward the cupboard, &quot;Isn&#39;t the cupboard neat??&quot;

Tifa, who was preparing herself a bowl of cereal, paused and gazed at 
him like a deer caught in the headlights. &quot;Um...I guess so?&quot; she 
answered uncertainly.

Henley looked at Baxter proudly, &quot;See!! I handle the responsibilities 
any ship cook does. I got a right to wonder and worry about that sort of 
stuff.&quot;

&quot;Like that is so hard. Did you pull something rearranging the plastic 
bowls or did the packets of instant oatmeal do you in? Or wait, 
wait...did you get coffee grounds in your eye? Was the tie for the bread 
bag too difficult? Should we put you down for worker&#39;s comp?&quot; Baxter 
took a bite of his oatmeal as his subordinate sputtered disbelievingly.

&quot;That hurts my feelings!&quot; Henley cried. &quot;That cuts me so deep I think 
I&#39;m going to die!&quot; He looked at Lenna sympathetically. &quot;Len! Don&#39;t you 
think I&#39;m the ship cook? Don&#39;t you think I&#39;ve got a right to wonder 
about how to go about my job?&quot;

Lenna frowned at him. Again, it was more for the purpose of 
communicating an idea versus there being any feeling behind the action. 
&quot;But you didn&#39;t make my breakfast. If you were ship cook, you&#39;d have 
made my breakfast. ...And you&#39;d know how to tie a decent knot.&quot;

Henley was struck silent by this shocking betrayal. He looked at Tifa, 
who was about to pour her milk into her bowl of cereal. &quot;WAIT!!&quot; he 
screamed. The fighter shrieked and nearly dropped the carton as some of 
the flakes from her cereal bowl spilled to the floor.

&quot;What?&quot; She cried as she looked around in bewilderment. &quot;What is it!?&quot;

Henley sprang from his seat and crossed over to her. He set his coffee 
down on the microwave and took the milk and bowl from her hands. &quot;Let me 
pour that for you. I&#39;m ship cook, after all.&quot; he said pleasantly.

Tifa stared at him, exasperated.

Baxter let a chuckle rumble deep in his throat, and as he did so, a full 
honest smile spread across his face. The fighter saw this and was caught 
off guard by it. What she had seen of the man had been cold and even 
unnerving. Despite Lenna&#39;s story the night before, the woman still found 
it difficult to imagine Baxter as anything but a hard-edged soldier. But 
here, he was relaxed, allowing his attention to be occupied by something 
simple and frivolous. The fighter marveled at this show of ease.

She looked at the three soldiers individually: Lenna quiet and 
detached-but sincere (perhaps to the point of being gratuitous); Henley, 
humorous and upbeat even when it seemed inappropriate; and finally, 
Baxter, whose cold exterior barely contained the dark person within. On 
their own, one couldn&#39;t see how they would manage for long. Each in 
their own way would succumb to the dangers of life in solitude. But 
together...

And it was then, all at once Tifa realized-

&quot;They&#39;re a family.&quot;

She blinked as Henley handed her bowl of cereal back with a spoon. &quot;Bon 
appetit, my sweet! You&#39;ll never taste a bowl of cereal as good as one 
made by Henley Inwell!&quot;

&quot;How do you make a bowl of cereal? You can put together one, but you 
don&#39;t make one.&quot;

&quot;Darn it, Len, why do you all ways insist on your stupid semantics!?&quot;

----------

Yuffie turned in her bed. She felt her head was thick and swollen, and 
her body ached from staying in the same position so long. With a mouth 
that felt dry and disgusting, she slowly rolled to the edge of the cot 
where she sat slouched with her face buried in her hands. She was still 
on the boat. The ordeal wasn&#39;t over yet.

But the girl felt better. For the moment. It wouldn&#39;t be long before her 
sea sickness would catch up to her.

The hatchway opened and the ninja looked up to see Tifa climb down the 
ladder. When the older woman saw her, she smiled. &quot;Hey! You&#39;re awake!&quot; 
she said.

&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; Yuffie grumbled, ill-tempered.

Tifa sat next to her. &quot;You don&#39;t think you&#39;ll make it? We&#39;re only a 
half-hour off-shore.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; the ninja perked up, glad to hear of solid land so near.

&quot;Yeah. I was worried. You pretty much slept two days without getting up 
or eating anything.&quot;

&quot;Two days? Really!?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s about six o&#39; clock in the evening right now. I think we left 
Costa Del Sol yesterday a little after six in the morning.&quot;

&quot;Oh man...I think I woke a few times, but I just made myself go back to 
sleep when I did.&quot; Yuffie rolled her shoulders once, then rubbed her 
neck. &quot;I&#39;m stiff as heck for it, but at least I didn&#39;t ralf all over the 
place, I guess.&quot;

Tifa scooted back further onto the bed and massaged the girl&#39;s 
shoulders. Yuffie sighed and closed her eyes, &quot;That feels good...&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;ll be fine till we dock?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine once I get up deck, I think. If I stay in this sardine can 
any longer, I think I&#39;m gonna go totally nuclear!&quot; The ninja looked back 
at Tifa with a blank face and grabbed the fighter&#39;s knee. &quot;Come up deck 
with me?&quot;

Tifa gazed back at her for a moment, then nodded. &quot;Sure.&quot;

Yuffie stood from the cot and the fighter followed her, ready to steady 
the girl should she find herself dizzy. The ninja did indeed sway a bit, 
and she closed her eyes as she tried to steady herself. But with a deep 
breath, she managed to make it to the ladder with little to no trouble. 
Relieved to see the girl stronger, Tifa followed her up the ladder.

Outside, on the deck, Yuffie tilted her head back and breathed in deep. 
The sky was gray. The wind was cold and sobering. She spread out her 
arms and fanned her fingers, felt the sweat in her palms cool and dry to 
nothing. Her hair blew in a disorderly tangle; the speed of the boat 
pushed it from her face, but a strong southern wind made her hair 
chaotic. Her dark eyes fixed on the dark looming titan that was Junon. 
She hugged herself and scowled.

Tifa came up slowly behind her, aware that the girl was preoccupied. She 
carefully wrapped her arms around the ninja&#39;s slim mid-riff and nuzzled 
her ear. &quot;What&#39;re you thinking?&quot; Tifa asked gently. Even so close, the 
fighter&#39;s voice seemed frail against the howling gusts that swept around 
their bodies. Carefully, the fighter pulled Yuffie with her to the 
railing, where they both leaned to the side against it.

&quot;Nothing,&quot; Yuffie said automatically, but she quickly closed her eyes 
and ducked her head. &quot;Uh, I mean...&quot;

Tifa kissed the back of her exposed neck.

The ninja squeezed her hands and leaned back in to the woman. The 
fighter squeezed her tighter at the action and savored the feeling. A 
fire crept up her legs.

&quot;I was just thinking-it&#39;s been three years since we came back to 
Junon...but on what terms are we going? Our heads are going into the 
sand, so just what the heck can we do there? Can we even manage to see 
Priscilla?&quot;

&quot;We will.&quot; Tifa said with lidded eyes fixed forward toward the nearing 
coast line. &quot;We&#39;ll figure something out.&quot;

&quot;There were things I wanted to do, but I guess that&#39;s outta the 
question...&quot;

&quot;Yuffie, this is temporary, remember? We&#39;re just doing this to keep them 
from gaining control of-&quot;

&quot;Our coming out of the closet?&quot; Yuffie grinned. &quot;That&#39;s funny. I thought 
they all ready kicked us out.&quot;

&quot;Well, we can still get a handle of the situation. I&#39;d prefer doing that 
over allowing them to poke at my right as a human being.&quot;

&quot;Point taken. But gawd-that goofy phrase! &#39;Coming out of the 
closet&#39;...what closet do you suppose we tumbled out of?&quot;

&quot;I think I came out of a broom closet.&quot;

&quot;Nah, I bet you came out of a walk-in closet, like me, with lots of 
stylish numbers hung up on polished wood hangers.&quot;

&quot;You think?&quot;

&quot;Rusty, please. You&#39;re with me. I&#39;m high-class.&quot;

A laugh burst out of Tifa at this exclamation, and Yuffie, pink cheeked, 
turned to give the fighter a look of indignation. &quot;Hey!&quot; she exclaimed. 
When the older woman didn&#39;t stop laughing, she gave Tifa&#39;s hand a small 
pinch.

&quot;Ouch!&quot; the fighter exclaimed between giggles. She turned Yuffie around 
and held her close by the waist. &quot;That hurt you know...&quot; she said with a 
pouted lip. Her humor threatened to spread a smile across her face, but 
the woman fought the urge so that only the corners of her lips twitched.

&quot;That&#39;s a lip to bite, Tifa. That&#39;s a lip to bite. I&#39;d be careful if I 
were you, cowgirl.&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to kiss it to make it better? It&#39;s still stinging...&quot;

&quot;Yeah? Well I&#39;ve got an ache I&#39;ve been meaning to ask you about, 
Tifa...&quot; Yuffie smirked and tilted her head to the side. &quot;Think you can 
help me with it?&quot;

The fighter blushed bashfully and softly brushed her nose against the 
ninja&#39;s. &quot;I don&#39;t know...can I?&quot; she asked carefully. Thoughts like ink 
black fear blossomed on her mind, thin and fragile, and spread through 
her consciousness against a stark white background charged with 
excitement. The mixture was strange but scintillating. Tifa thought of 
the night before and tried desperately to decide what she really wanted.

Intensely aware that her words had caused the woman&#39;s humor to fade, 
Yuffie reached up a hand and traced the fighter&#39;s jaw line. With her 
other hand, she ran it through Tifa&#39;s hair and let it stop at the base 
of the woman&#39;s head, where she carefully pulled her closer for a kiss. 
Tifa&#39;s eyes fell shut when their lips met.

When the ninja pulled away, she did so with a smile. &quot;I think you can. 
But I&#39;m a big girl. I can suck it up and wait. They tell me good things 
are worth waiting for, y&#39;know? I was bound to do it someday.&quot;

Tifa giggled nervously and lowered her gaze, her hair spilling over her 
shoulder and curtaining her face. &quot;Are you telling me you&#39;re gonna work 
it out yourself?&quot; she jested, relieved and in a small way disappointed.

Yuffie caressed the woman&#39;s back and grinned mischievously. &quot;Cripes, 
Tifa! I didn&#39;t think you talked that way. It&#39;s sorta hot!&quot; the ninja 
poked her side. &quot;Come on, say something else. Whisper it in my ear, 
Rusty.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t poke there!&quot; Tifa exclaimed with a small jump. &quot;It makes me 
tickle! Hey, HEY!!&quot;

&quot;Whoops, sorry, a chill ran through me. Gawd! It came again! ...And 
again, and again, and again-&quot;

Tifa pulled away from Yuffie, laughing hysterically. &quot;No stop, I can&#39;t 
breathe!&quot;

&quot;Sorry to interrupt your tickle-fest my sweets, but I&#39;m afraid Baxter 
wanted to talk to you before we arrive at the dock.&quot; Henley&#39;s round face 
beamed at them from where he stood near the cabin. His eyes widened when 
he pointed at Yuffie. &quot;Oh, hey! You look a lot better!&quot; he gestured at 
Tifa slyly, &quot;Guess she&#39;s enough to keep your mind preoccupied from the 
waves huh?&quot; He winked with a small chuckle.

Tifa turned beet red.

Yuffie grit her teeth at him, &quot;Vanish, beach-ball head. You&#39;re bringing 
my nausea back.&quot; Truthfully, she seemed a little paler than when she had 
woken up. Her conversation with Tifa really had kept her mind from 
thinking about how the boat rolled, or how the horizon never seemed to 
stay still, or how she felt like she were moving even when she wasn&#39;t... 
The ninja placed a hand on her forehead and closed her eyes. It had been 
in the back of her thoughts, but her distraction had allowed her to defy 
her condition and successfully keep from drowning in it.

But suddenly, that magic seemed gone.

Tifa immediately noticed how the ninja gripped the guard rail and how 
her face now went from pale to green. She reached out a hand with an 
uncertain grimace. &quot;Yuffie?&quot; she said tentatively.

Yuffie, with one hand on her stomach and her lips paper white, turned 
toward the water quickly and retched. Tifa face-palmed and sighed 
wearily. Henley cringed and looked away.

&quot;Cripes, I don&#39;t think even Hades himself can take credit for what 
you&#39;ve got, sister!&quot; he exclaimed with a shudder.

Both women imagined throwing him overboard.
