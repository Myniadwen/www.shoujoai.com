<a href="../ff7/vagrhap-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>Breathe in.

Breath out.

Breathe in.

Breath out.

A rhythm that turned the woman&#39;s mind into an orchestrated play of 
madness, she lay still as the cadences of existence pierced through the 
walls of her room. The distant sounds hinted to an entire world outside, 
begging to be explored, begging to be robbed of its sense of mystery and 
secrecy.

But she did not move, for she knew one thing of the world outside, and 
that was that Yuffie was in the midst of it.

Tifa wasn&#39;t sure what kept her lying on her back, still as a rock, as 
she raged a staring contest with the ceiling. There was a nervous energy 
coursing up and down her limbs and a tension in her jaw that would not 
ease. The woman was sure that, despite her surprise, she was not 
afraid...but nor was she happy.

She was simply out of harmony.

What to do? What to think?

Tifa wasn&#39;t sure.

So she breathed in slowly through her nose, and out.

In...

And out...

In...

And out...

The bed next to hers was empty. This Tifa knew, for immediately upon 
waking, she had looked for her companion. The other bed had been made, 
crisp and neat, so that it seemed no one had been there, and lying 
primly on the pillow, a small white note had been left. The fighter 
still had yet to read it.

As time ticked on, ideas made themselves present in the way of images in 
Tifa&#39;s mind. They drifted in and out like wayward guests, their presence 
hazy at first before solidifying into a clear feeling of reminiscence. 
Mentally, she reached toward them, silently asking what they wanted, 
silently asking what it was she should do.

It wasn&#39;t until the image of Yuffie&#39;s face drifted to her in a wispy 
smoke of warmth and ash that Tifa sat up and placed her feet on the 
floor. Pushing herself up onto her feet, the woman allowed her arms to 
rise on either side of her, as if a strong gust of wind suddenly were 
picking her up and carrying her away.

&quot;Far away...&quot; the woman whispered, settling back onto her heels. She 
closed her eyes and straightened her arms, raising them slowly. The 
feeling of exposure made her feel awkward and vulnerable, but the woman 
continued to raise her arms until her hands pointed to the ceiling. &quot;If 
my soul could fly away, where would it go?&quot; Tifa wondered, stretching 
with a sigh. Arms flopping limply at her sides, the woman slumped 
slightly. She cracked open her eyes.

The white note glared at her as a stream of light hit it from outside.

Taking a small step forward, the woman leaned forward and read the 
note&#39;s hastily scrawled message.

&quot;Morning sleepy head! Meet me for breakfast at Georgia&#39;s. I&#39;ll be the 
hot chick in the lime green tank top.&quot; - Yuffie

Tifa crossed her arms and straightened, her eyes still trained on the 
note. Then, after a moment, her eyes flickered up to the door.

----------

Despite her silence, she attracted many stares, wondering gazes that 
marveled and questioned at the mysterious aura that hung about her. 
&quot;What caused such a strong sense of contentment to have her sitting 
there with such a smile on her face?&quot; people asked. She ate her meal 
silently, lifting her eyes to no one. She cut into her pancakes with her 
fork, meanwhile ignoring the insistent glint of the knife left abandoned 
on the table. The pancakes bled onto the plate; a sweet, thick blood 
that made her lips sticky and her tongue dart out in hungry sweeps. It 
was a very pleasant morning...

And Yuffie Kisaragi was simply pleasant.

Standing frozen at the entrance of the restaurant was Tifa, a hand 
placed uncertainly on the door as she kept it open a crack. Her gaze was 
probing, trying to understand the look on Yuffie&#39;s face. Was the girl 
certain of Tifa&#39;s answer? Did she believe Tifa would accept the girl&#39;s 
feelings? Or was she simply happy for the freedom? The freedom to openly 
state what she wanted, even if her feelings may not be returned?

Dark eyes lifted from their meal, and a sticky smile made itself present 
as the ninja locked eyes with the woman.

Tifa left her place at the door and walked to Yuffie&#39;s table, sliding 
into the seat across from her smoothly.

Swallowing her food, Yuffie chirped merrily, &quot;Good morning, Rusty!&quot;

Tifa gave a small, uncertain smile. &quot;Good morning, Yuffie.&quot;

Yuffie took a sip at her orange juice before asking mildly, &quot;Sleep 
well?&quot;

The woman shifted slightly in her seat. Nodding her head once, she 
answered quietly, &quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s good.&quot; the girl replied. She took another bite of her pancakes, 
a small sigh sounding from her as she chewed her food happily.

Tifa stared at her. Feeling the weight of her gaze, Yuffie looked up at 
her, a smile playing at the corners of her lips. &quot;I bet you can&#39;t make 
heads or tails of me right now.&quot; When the fighter didn&#39;t respond to this 
statement, the girl sat back, a smirk now on her face as she tilted her 
head to regard the woman. &quot;You think I wasn&#39;t serious last night?&quot; the 
girl asked slowly.

Tifa gazed levelly across the table before looking down. Shaking her 
head, she said, &quot;No. I think you were completely serious.&quot;

Yuffie nodded. Turning her head, she crossed her arms across her chest. 
&quot;Judging by the look on your face, I&#39;d say you&#39;ve all ready got an 
answer to my question from last night.&quot;

Again, the fighter nodded. Her eyes flickered up, and the woman saw the 
girl&#39;s smirk now gone. She was now staring across the table at Tifa, her 
eyes wide and intent. The woman quickly averted her gaze back down to 
the table.

Tifa, feeling as if somehow the entire world seemed to be watching her, 
leaned forward, her shoulders hunching slightly. Glancing about her 
quickly, the woman began to speak in a low tone. &quot;Y&#39;know, Yuffie-I-&quot;

Tifa stopped abruptly, a frown coming over face as her tongue fell still 
in her mouth. She realized she didn&#39;t know what to say. This aggravated 
her, for the answer had been so clear not but a minute ago. Eyes glaring 
into the glossy finish of the table, the woman found a dim reflection of 
herself in the wood.

Yuffie blinked a few times. &quot;...Tifa?&quot; she said tentatively.

Closing her eyes, Tifa tried to grasp the message she wished to convey.

In her mind, there was discord. The words arranged themselves and 
rearranged themselves, some phrases dropping letters and losing meaning, 
meanwhile other phrases gained letters and took on new directions. Her 
thoughts tripped over one another as they tried to organize themselves 
and realize just what their aims were.

A feather light touch caused Tifa&#39;s eyes to snap open, and her eyes 
darted up in surprise.

Yuffie was sitting forward, her hand lightly touching the woman&#39;s as a 
look of concern flashed across her face. &quot;Hey...if it&#39;s gonna cause you 
any stress...just don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; the girl said, her eyes soft 
and appealing.

Tifa sucked in air, pulling her hand away a little more quickly than she 
meant to. Sitting back, the woman immediately regretted the motion. A 
look of surprise, then hurt, flashed across Yuffie&#39;s face in rapid 
succession. It disappeared within a split second and was quickly 
replaced with a neutral expression.

But Tifa still saw.

Heart sinking, the fighter looked down into her lap, thinking scathingly 
to herself, &quot;You might as well have told her you hate her, you fool.&quot;

There was an awkward pause as the two sat, both trying to think of the 
best way to deal with the situation. Tifa considered apologizing, but 
with a sinking heart, realized she didn&#39;t know what she was apologizing 
for.

A high laugh caused the woman to jerk in surprise. Eyes shooting up, 
Tifa saw Yuffie grinning sheepishly and scratching the back of her head. 
The girl&#39;s eyes were fixed on her empty plate, and there was something 
humorless about her gaze.

&quot;Well I guess that&#39;s it, then.&quot; The girl said, her tone saying, &quot;Oh 
well.&quot; The girl closed her eyes and giggled, shaking her head. &quot;Pretty 
dumb of me, huh? Thinking you would ever agree to...well...&quot; the girl 
lifted her head and stared across the table at Tifa, her smile faltering 
some. The woman wore a sad expression. &quot;Yeah.&quot; the girl said, shaking 
her head again. Her smile hitched back up, wider this time. &quot;Yeah, that 
was to-tally dumb of me!&quot; Standing with a luxurious sigh, Yuffie 
stretched her arms high over her head. &quot;Oh well...I guess that&#39;s it 
then.&quot; she repeated, her eyes glazing some.

Tifa looked up at her, panic now causing her stomach to flip violently.

Did this mean that Yuffie was going to leave?

&quot;You&#39;re the one leaving her, dear,&quot; a vicious little voice hissed in the 
woman&#39;s head.

Tifa&#39;s muscles bunched and her eyes widened.

But she didn&#39;t want to go back to Tiesmire. She didn&#39;t want to go back 
to her lonely little home. Just at the thought of having to return 
there, alone, left with nothing but her fluffy pillows, overabundance of 
candles, retro-styled kitchen, and decrepit old truck, made the woman 
want to stand up and cry out, &quot;NO!&quot;

...Which is exactly what she did.

Yuffie froze and stared at her, her eyes bewildered and shocked. The 
entire restaurant stared as well, and Tifa could feel the blush creep up 
from her neck to her hair roots.

Rubbing her arm nervously, the woman mumbled, &quot;I-I mean to say...that 
things don&#39;t need to end...not like this...&quot;

Now the ninja fixed her with a scrutinizing gaze, her brows furrowing 
deeply. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

Clearing her throat, Tifa looked around at the other restaurant patrons, 
who, at the glimpse of her eyes, returned to their own business. Still 
sporting a deep blush, the woman indicated meekly for the girl to sit, 
which she did. Sliding into her own seat, the woman let out a sigh.

Running a hand through her hair, Tifa looked at Yuffie shyly. &quot;What I 
mean is...that even though I don&#39;t...I can&#39;t be with you, we don&#39;t need 
to stop our trip.&quot;

Yuffie blinked at her. &quot;Uh...come again?&quot;

Tifa sighed and leaned forward, a frown now coming over her face. &quot;I 
don&#39;t wanna go back home, Yuffie. I&#39;m having too much fun out here with 
you. If I went back now...I think I&#39;d go crazy. I really think I would.&quot;

Yuffie was now staring at her as if she were insane. &quot;Tifa, d&#39;you 
realize how positively weird this&#39;ll be?? I&#39;m like...not straight! AND 
I&#39;ve got a thing for you! We&#39;re talking a double whammy here! Don&#39;t you 
think that&#39;ll cause just a teeny bit of a problem?&quot;

Tifa winced at the volume Yuffie said this. Gritting her teeth, she 
hissed, &quot;Keep your voice down! If people find out, they&#39;ll never let it 
down!&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s face pulled into an annoyed scowl. &quot;Well if its got you acting 
so jumpy, why&#39;re you even speaking to me now?&quot;

The woman sighed and closed her eyes, letting her face fall into her 
hand. &quot;No, I&#39;m sorry. That isn&#39;t what I meant. It&#39;s just...Yuffie, 
despite how confident you may feel, you can&#39;t be so obnoxious about it. 
Especially considering-&quot;

&quot;If you&#39;re going to tell me that what I&#39;m feeling for you is all just a 
bunch of confused emotions and bungled ideas, then I&#39;ve got a place you 
can stuff that comment, because I ain&#39;t gonna have it.&quot;

Tifa gazed at the girl, exasperated. &quot;What&#39;re you saying now? That you 
love me? You said it yourself, Yuffie! You wouldn&#39;t be so bold as to 
call it that!&quot;

The girl quirked an eyebrow. &quot;Are you saying I can&#39;t have feelings for 
you without loving you?&quot;

The woman rolled her eyes to the ceiling, &quot;This conversation is so not 
going where I want it to...&quot;

Yuffie sucked at her teeth, her eyes sharp as she regarded the woman 
across from her. Leaning forward onto her elbows, the girl let out a 
sigh of her own. &quot;Y&#39;know, I&#39;m just afraid that you&#39;ll be uncomfortable, 
that&#39;s all. I mean, we can get separate hotel rooms and stuff, but what 
about on the road? You realize of course that there isn&#39;t much room for 
separation on my bike, right? And you&#39;ve gotta consider, you just, like, 
rejected me an&#39; stuff. Do I really want to be around someone I&#39;ve got 
the hots for, but who obviously doesn&#39;t feel the same way about me? I 
may be thick-headed, Tifa, but I&#39;m no glutton for punishment.&quot;

Tifa nodded dejectedly, understanding the girl&#39;s reasoning. In a way, it 
warmed Tifa&#39;s heart to know that despite everything, Yuffie still took 
Tifa&#39;s feelings into consideration. Now it was time to return the 
gesture. &quot;I hadn&#39;t thought about it that way. I...should have realized 
it wouldn&#39;t be so easy for you to just agree to this.&quot; the woman smiled 
ruefully. &quot;I guess I am rusty. You&#39;ve surpassed me in a lot of things, 
Yuffie.&quot;

The ninja gazed at the woman with soft eyes. &quot;There you go again, acting 
like some ancient hag doomed to being left in the dust. The heck&#39;s the 
matter with you, anyway? Giving up so easy? It&#39;s a lot more interesting 
when you argue...&quot; the last sentence, Yuffie grumbled, slouching some in 
her seat.

Tifa shook her head. &quot;This isn&#39;t really something I can argue about. If 
you&#39;re uncomfortable with our continuing to travel together then...what 
can I say? It wouldn&#39;t be fair to you. But...I know what I&#39;m saying. I 
want this road trip to continue, and I&#39;m willing to deal with any little 
dilemmas along the way. If you are what you say you are, Yuffie, then I 
can accept that.&quot;

The girl blinked at her. &quot;...You really mean that?&quot;

Tifa smiled and nodded.

Sitting up, the girl grinned slowly. &quot;Just like a mastered fire 
materia.&quot; she said suddenly.

The fighter gave her a puzzled look. &quot;Huh?&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s grin widened. &quot;A fire materia! It&#39;s a warm feeling when you 
feel it reach its third level of crystallization. Y&#39;know, the firaga 
stage? The orb glows red and you can see the flames flickering along the 
facets. The energy runs up and down your limbs, and you get this brief 
high. But what makes it best is the sense of security and sureness you 
feel settle in you. Don&#39;t you remember?&quot;

Tifa thought for a moment, eyes lifting slightly as she gazed over 
Yuffie&#39;s head and into the past. Then she nodded, recalling the brief 
ecstasy she felt whenever her ice materia reached its next stage.

Leaning forward onto her elbows, Yuffie tilted her head slightly to the 
side. &quot;To have that sort of feeling on the field meant everything, 
remember? And you wanna know what? To hear you say that you&#39;d accept me 
for who I am, just as I am, for all that I am, made me feel just like 
that. Confident and strong. ...Thanks, Tifa.&quot;

Tifa smiled at her, her face tinted pink. &quot;So uh...&quot; the woman bit her 
lip and gazed at Yuffie shyly. &quot;Does this mean you&#39;ll still let me 
travel with you?&quot;

Yuffie quirked an eyebrow, her grin turning cheeky. &quot;Would it mean we&#39;d 
have to get separate rooms?&quot;

The fighter, again, burned bright from embarrassment.

The ninja snickered and reached across the table, giving the woman a 
sound clap on the shoulder. &quot;Re-lax! I was only kidding!&quot;

Tifa grit her teeth. &quot;Whatever happened to not wanting to make me 
uncomfortable?&quot;

Yuffie lifted her eyes innocently to the ceiling. &quot;W-ell...if you 
continue to react the way you do, all cute and embarrassed like, the 
little predator in me won&#39;t be able to resist your meek attitude.&quot; the 
girl&#39;s gaze fell back to Tifa, and the woman shivered slightly at the 
smoldering grin she sent her. &quot;Besides, I know for certain you&#39;ve got a 
thing for girls, even if you say you don&#39;t want to be with me in 
particular. But the way I figure it, if I keep flirting with you, you 
won&#39;t be able to resist me anymore.&quot;

Coughing, the fighter looked away pointedly, her heart hammering against 
her chest. &quot;So what should we do today?&quot; Tifa asked, her tone hinting 
her desire for a topic change.

Yuffie&#39;s eyes lit up in delight at the woman&#39;s refusal to respond to her 
comment. However, her expression turned to a grimace as she remembered 
something. &quot;Uh...actually,&quot; she began awkwardly, &quot;I&#39;ve got to meet 
someone today. I don&#39;t know how long the meeting&#39;ll take, but I&#39;m going 
to have to go alone.&quot; Yuffie looked apologetically across the table.

At this announcement, Tifa turned her head in surprise. &quot;What? Who is it 
that you&#39;re meeting? ...Er, if you don&#39;t mind my asking.&quot; The woman 
added quickly.

Yuffie rolled her eyes, &quot;That spook my dad sent after me. Remember? Last 
night he left a message at the hotel. I&#39;ve gotta go tell him, and 
whoever he came with, to buzz off and tell my dad to leave me alone.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s right. I forgot Otis gave you that envelope...&quot; Tifa said. 
With all that had happened since the night before, the woman had 
completely forgotten about it.

Yuffie nodded grimly. &quot;Yeah. So...&quot; the girl rubbed the back of her 
neck, &quot;You&#39;re going to have to go on without me today. At least until 
sometime this afternoon. It shouldn&#39;t take me longer&#39;n that to tell my 
dad&#39;s henchmen to scram.&quot;

Tifa shrugged. &quot;That&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll just go shopping today. I need some 
clothes for this hot weather anyway.&quot;

Yuffie smiled suddenly and leaned forward. &quot;Hey! You wanna go clubbing 
tonight? We didn&#39;t go the night before, and I don&#39;t wanna leave Costa 
Del Sol without experiencing the night life first.&quot;

The fighter nodded eagerly at the suggestion. &quot;Yes, that sounds like a 
great idea!&quot; and the woman was sincere. It would be a chance for the two 
to divert their attention to other people...Yuffie in particular.

&quot;All right.&quot; the girl said with a nod in return. Standing, she took out 
a bit of money and laid it on the table. &quot;Well, I&#39;m off. I&#39;ve got to 
meet that creep in a bit, and like I said, I haven&#39;t got a clue how 
long&#39;ll it&#39;ll take for me to shake &#39;em off.&quot; She bit her lip nervously 
and looked down at Tifa, &quot;Are you sure you&#39;ll be okay while I&#39;m gone?&quot;

Tifa gave her a critical look. &quot;Yuffie, I know how to be by myself. I&#39;m 
a big girl.&quot;

The ninja grinned sheepishly. &quot;Yeah. Sorry...hey, I&#39;ll see you in a bit, 
&#39;kay?&quot;

The woman nodded and gave a slight wave. &quot;You go. I&#39;ll be all right, I 
promise.&quot;

Yuffie smirked and began walking backward toward the restaurant&#39;s exit. 
&quot;And while I&#39;m gone, try not to look so alluring, all right? As long as 
you stay single, I&#39;m certain I&#39;ve still got a chance.&quot;

Tifa&#39;s face flushed red, and she opened her mouth to tell the girl to 
quit being so glaringly flamboyant when she realized that saying this 
across the room would completely defeat the purpose. And so, chagrined 
and annoyed, the woman watched as the ninja darted out of the 
restaurant, a mischievous glint in her eye.

Turning around in her seat, Tifa scowled down at the table.

It occurred to her that perhaps it would&#39;ve been wise to set some 
boundaries with her friend. Some clear lines of limitations that, not 
even Yuffie, with all her wiles, could figure out a way to dance around. 
But even as she sat and thought furiously over her new situation, the 
woman could not get over the one glaring fact that had kept her from 
opening her mouth in protest, and that one fact was this:

...Tifa liked the new attention.

----------

Whilst wondering aimlessly along the golden streets of Costa Del Sol, 
Tifa had found herself at a loss as to what to do. Yuffie seemed almost 
a guide to life and how to go about experiencing it, and without her, 
Tifa felt confused and uncertain.

&quot;Oh I&#39;m a big girl all right...&quot; the woman muttered scornfully to 
herself as she gazed anxiously around her at an unassuming street 
corner.

It was with a sudden strong gust of wind and a flash of opaque white 
that the fighter&#39;s hand darted out in a burst of instinct, her hand 
snatching at what turned out to be a piece of paper. The paper was a 
flyer, an advertisement for a clothing store in the northern part of 
town that recently opened. &quot;Enrauge Mystique.&quot; Tifa read carefully, her 
nose wrinkling at the odd name. The loopy print and haughty mark of 
design clued the woman in to just what kind of store this was: a very 
expensive one. But with money not an issue and time dwindling away, Tifa 
came to the decision that she would give this ritzy clothing store a 
try.

After a ten minute taxi drive to the other side of town, the woman 
stepped out of the car and found herself emerging into a world of stiff 
atmosphere, designer purses, and pure-bred lap-dogs. She gazed 
uncertainly after the taxi as it drove away, tugging nervously at the 
hem of her lavender-colored tank-top shirt, as if in attempt to hide her 
faded, straight-legged jeans.

Holding up the flyer, Tifa licked her lips as she re-read the address of 
the store. Glancing about nervously, she began walking toward the 
nearest street corner.

The street-corner of Toreg and Montague seemed to be the center of the 
northern district, the streets unusually clean and even, and each 
building a historic landmark breathing of new life and vitality. Bright, 
delicate flowers were planted wherever possible, whilst trees offered 
shade to those resting their feet. The shops lining the streets each 
seemed to concern themselves with only the aesthetic, whether it was 
through clothes, shoes, hats, beauty products, organic food, or mineral 
supplements.

At the corner where she stood, Tifa began to feel like the hideous 
blemish in the world of the rich.

But she had resolved to come and see the store, and not wanting her 
efforts wasted, the woman began walking up the sidewalk, her eyes 
darting about in the hopes of spotting the shop&#39;s sign. There were 
stares as Tifa walked, and she made it a point not to acknowledge the 
blatant ogling of those she passed. Slim men in vests and khaki pants, 
large men in suits, shriveled women in angular dresses, and voluptuous 
young girls with tiny purses stopped to gaze after her as the fighter 
went by. Though Tifa had often received stares due to her notoriety, she 
couldn&#39;t recall a time before when the attention she received seemed 
so...disdainful. She was like a freak among these people.

To them, she was but a barbarian.

&quot;It weren&#39;t for me and the others, they wouldn&#39;t even be able to live 
this way.&quot; Tifa thought, with a note of indignation.

Under this cloud of resentment, the woman found what she was looking 
for. Her eyes fell upon the familiar loopy letters of &#39;Enrauge Mystique&#39; 
which were engraved into a wooden plaque suspended over the entrance. 
Giving the people around her a severe look, Tifa walked into the store 
haughtily, her jaw set and her gaze hard.

The store smelled lightly of roses, and the woman breathed the scent in 
deeply. Surprised at the effect it had on the tension in her muscles, 
Tifa allowed her angry thoughts to fall away as she examined her new 
surroundings closely. Lavender drapings came cascading from the ceiling, 
lights shining through them and giving the store a smooth tint. The 
store was, in reality, rather small, but the modern and colorful designs 
on the walls and clever clothing displays more than made up for it.

Somewhat entranced, Tifa stepped forward slowly. The carpet beneath her 
feet felt thick and spongy. Taking notice to this, the woman hopped up 
slightly, her face turned down in a puzzled scowl as she tested the feel 
of the rouge-colored carpet.

&quot;Ah, miss?&quot;

Tifa looked up in surprise. A lithe young man with spiked, strawberry 
blond hair, mauve knit sweater, and straight black pants was giving her 
a confused look.

Grinning sheepishly, Tifa ran a hand through her hair. &quot;Uh, sorry, I was 
just...um...&quot; she hopped again. Pointing to the ground, she gave a 
slight laugh. &quot;Your carpet is very nice.&quot;

The man gave her a dubious smile.

Face turning pink, the woman wrung her hands, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I really do 
have the intention to buy something here, it&#39;s just I have no idea what 
I&#39;m-&quot;

&quot;Your Tifa Lockhart, aren&#39;t you?&quot; The man interjected, his green eyes 
widening some.

Tifa blinked at him. Face turning pinker, she nodded her head slightly. 
&quot;Yes. Yes I am.&quot;

The man&#39;s face brightened incredibly and he held out his hand. &quot;It&#39;s a 
pleasure to meet you Ms. Lockhart. My name is Roland Enrauge, and I&#39;m 
the owner of this store.&quot;

The fighter&#39;s eyebrows rose high at this, and with an incredulous smile, 
she shook the man&#39;s hand.

&quot;I must say, this is quite an honor, Ms. Lockhart.&quot; Roland said, leaning 
forward some. &quot;To have you walk into my humble little store is simply 
beyond words!&quot;

Flustered, Tifa pulled back her hand from the man&#39;s vice grip. &quot;Um, 
thank you.&quot;

The man clasped his hands together and straightened. &quot;So. You say you&#39;re 
not sure what you&#39;re looking for, right?&quot;

The woman rubbed her left arm and shrugged. &quot;Well, you see, tonight I&#39;m 
going to go out dancing with my...&quot; Tifa paused, and the man gazed at 
her curiously. &quot;...My friend.&quot; she said at last, a frown coming over her 
features.

Roland smiled a slow, knowing smile. He spread his arms wide. &quot;This is 
no problem! I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve got something here that you&#39;ll like.&quot; 
Winking, he offered his arm and gave a charming grin. &quot;Come, we&#39;ll work 
something out.&quot;

Pleased by his elegant air and relieved that her name brought on 
positive results, Tifa took his arm.

----------

The rock rolled easily about her fingertips as she pushed it about the 
top of the retaining wall. The ocean breeze teased her, blowing dark 
strands across her skin. She was standing in a small plaza, marked off 
by raised flower beds. The plants surrounding them conversed amongst 
themselves in their quiet language.

But she cared nothing for their secretive talk.

Someone she knew and cared about was alone because she had to be here.

This did not make her happy.

So her gaze remained on the rock.

A man slightly taller than her stood a few feet away. His arms were 
crossed and his dark eyes trained on her face. His dark hair was brushed 
back, and his slim mustache was trimmed neatly, for it was an important 
occasion. He was dressed in a dark suit, one that was cut so as to show 
the strength in his arms and legs. Though but a footman, he was still a 
representative of his country. A country that was quickly learning to 
lift its head high again.

But she wasn&#39;t much impressed by his physical prowess or his 
self-righteous nationalism.

She knew more than a hundred different pressure points, half of which 
would kill him if hit with enough force.

So Yuffie&#39;s gaze remained on the rock.

A group of men dressed in similar suits stood behind the man with the 
mustache. They were all standing straight and rigid. They were waiting 
for a signal.

The man, heaving a sigh, crossed his arms over his chest, his suit 
jacket straining at the stress caused. &quot;He wants you back, Miss.&quot; was 
his tired statement. He spoke in his native tongue, finding the matter 
much too important to be discussed in any Eastern language.

Her manipulation of the rock ceased, and the girl&#39;s eyes narrowed. After 
a moment, she resumed rolling the rock about beneath her fingers.

Annoyed and insulted at the girl&#39;s refusal to give a response, the man 
spoke again, an edge in his voice this time. &quot;Miss, Master Godo is not 
pleased. He bid me tell you that if you do not choose to return to Wutai 
willingly, then we have full authority to-&quot;

&quot;Your boring me, Uteki.&quot; Yuffie said, her tone supporting her statement. 
Her gaze still remained on the rock.

Uteki&#39;s face reddened and he took a step forward, &quot;Miss Kisaragi-!&quot;

&quot;Try something you greasy, forked-tongued baboon. Just try. I&#39;ll 
castrate you.&quot;

At the tone of her voice, the man checked himself and took a step back.

Still rolling the rock, the young girl spoke, but not in her native 
tongue. Instead, she spoken in the Eastern language. &quot;You go and you 
tell that thick headed old goat that I&#39;m not going back.&quot;

Uteki&#39;s face strained. &quot;But Miss Kisaragi-&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t asking you, Uteki.&quot; was Yuffie&#39;s cold reply.

The man&#39;s eyes narrowed. Nevertheless, he bowed. &quot;Yes...Miss Kisaragi.&quot; 
the men behind Uteki quickly followed suit, bowing low enough to make a 
ninety-degree angle.

Yuffie&#39;s eyes finally lifted from the rock as she turned to give the men 
a critical look. Tossing the rock up once in the air, the girl caught it 
with a quick swipe of her hand. &quot;And another thing. You and your goonies 
need to quit following me and Tifa. It&#39;s really annoying. You aren&#39;t 
even discreet about it. At Corel? Were you all drunk or what? You&#39;ll be 
lucky if Tifa didn&#39;t notice anything!&quot;

Uteki grit his teeth, but only gave a terse, &quot;My apologies, ma&#39;am.&quot; as a 
reply.

Sighing, Yuffie turned and began to walk away, but not before tossing 
the little rock over her shoulder. &quot;You guys really are lame, y&#39;know?&quot;

The rock skittered into Uteki&#39;s view.

The men didn&#39;t move until the girl&#39;s footsteps were out of hearing 
range. When she was gone, they straightened and, immediately, they began 
to speak.

&quot;Should we grab her?&quot;

&quot;What will Master Godo say?&quot;

&quot;What an insolent girl!&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t just go back to Wutai!&quot;

&quot;What are we going to do?&quot;

But Uteki wasn&#39;t listening to them.

His gaze remained on the rock.

----------

&quot;Y&#39;know, I&#39;m not entirely sure about the color...it seems a 
bit...well...loud.&quot;

&quot;But the color screams &#39;energy&#39; and &#39;strength&#39;! People won&#39;t be able to 
keep their eyes off you!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s kinda what worries me...I mean, don&#39;t get me wrong, neon green 
would be a great color...if I were directing traffic at night, that is.&quot;

&quot;All right, all right, I understand...still, I think the dress really 
brings out your curves.&quot;

A sigh. &quot;Everyone seems interested in my curves these days.&quot;

Roland rubbed her arm warmly. &quot;Have faith! We&#39;ll have found a dress for 
you before you know it.&quot;

Tifa smiled gratefully at the man. &quot;Thank you, Roland.&quot;

The man smiled, small wrinkles appearing at the corners of his eyes. 
Picking up a dress from a nearby rack, he held it up to her. &quot;Here, try 
this dress next. I think it&#39;s got more of that subtleness you&#39;ve been 
looking for.&quot;

Taking the dress, Tifa turned and entered the dressing stall. Forty 
minutes after entering the store and she had already gone through six 
dresses. Staring into the mirror, Tifa shook her head in bewilderment at 
her latest dress, which was a blinding shade of green with large, 
oval-shaped cuts along the sides.

As she slipped out of the dress, the woman couldn&#39;t help muttering. 
&quot;Even without the color, I wouldn&#39;t have worn this.&quot;

But it was something she knew she would have to deal with. This was not 
the first time Tifa had dressed for a night out on the town, and she 
knew the style of dress. Tight and revealing. However, her earlier luck 
at finding a swimsuit had her holding out hope that she would once again 
get lucky. This sentiment was further reinforced when she lifted up 
Roland&#39;s latest suggestion.

The dress he picked out was like all the others; short and slim. However 
(and Tifa noted this with great pleasure) there was no extreme cut in 
the fabric that led to her back or sides being bared, nor was the color 
overly bright. In fact, the color was a dark shade of black, and the 
laces (which embroidered the cups and the sides) was a rich burgundy.

Biting her lip, Tifa unzipped the back and slipped the dress on, 
slipping her arms through the straps carefully as if afraid an 
overzealous movement would cause wrinkles in the fabric. Zipping the 
dress back up, the woman shyly gazed at herself in the mirror.

After a moment, she smiled.

The dress, though still short, was not as bad as some of the others she 
had been forced to try. Striking a pose, Tifa noted with a slight bit of 
exhilaration that the dress complemented her body rather well.

Outside, the woman distantly noted Roland suddenly give an exclaimed 
cry. &quot;Ah! There you are! Where have you been? You won&#39;t believe who I&#39;m 
working with right now!&quot;

Already more than certain that she had found what she had been looking 
for, the woman turned and opened the dressing stall door, stepping out 
with a single hand on her hip and a sly grin on her face.

&quot;I think my libido just went up.&quot; Tifa said jokingly as she came into 
view. The smile on her face vanished, however, as she realized who 
Roland had been speaking to.

Chauncey stood next to Roland, his eyes shaded with a large pair of 
sunglasses and his face darkened by a five o&#39; clock shadow. His wavy 
hair was damp and curled at the back, and over his shoulders was the 
same dark, heavy leather jacket he had worn the night Tifa and Yuffie 
saw him at the restaurant. Thumbs hooked into his dark, faded denim 
jeans, the man had on a white tank beneath his jacket and a pair of 
large mahogany boots. The man&#39;s head snapped up at the sound of her 
voice, and his eyebrows rose at the sight of Tifa.

The woman, meanwhile, debated whether or not she should run back into 
the dressing stall.

Roland smiled proudly as he turned to regard Tifa&#39;s dress. &quot;Now that 
looks good on you! You see? You just need faith. Everyone woman has a 
dress to wear, they only need to look.&quot;

&quot;Can others look too?&quot; Chauncey asked, lowering his glasses and grinning 
appreciatively.

Tifa crossed her arms across her chest and fought the blush that crept 
up her face.

Roland clapped Chauncey on the shoulder. &quot;Chauncey, I&#39;d like you to meet 
Tifa Lockhart. She came in today looking for something nice to wear for 
tonight and as you can see, she&#39;s now found it.&quot;

Chauncey&#39;s smile faded some as he heard what Roland said. Looking at the 
man then back at Tifa, he frowned. &quot;What? Who&#39;d you say she was?&quot;

Roland returned his frown. &quot;This is Tifa Lockhart! Don&#39;t you recognize 
her?&quot; the man rolled his eyes at Chauncey&#39;s shocked silence and turned 
to Tifa. &quot;Don&#39;t mind my cousin, he&#39;s none too bright.&quot;

Tifa gawked at him. &quot;He&#39;s your cousin?&quot;

Roland frowned at her next. &quot;Yes. Why?&quot; he looked between Tifa and 
Chauncey in confusion. &quot;Have...you two met before?&quot;

Chauncey rubbed the back of his neck. Grinning now out of incredulity, 
he nodded. &quot;We&#39;ve run into each other a few times...&quot;

Tifa said nothing. Clearing her throat, she opened the dressing stall. 
&quot;Um, I&#39;ll just take this, okay Roland?&quot; Slamming the door shut before 
she could receive a response, the woman pressed a hand to her forehead.

At the register, Chauncey hovered behind her, his eyes boring into her 
back. The woman began to get annoyed. As she handed the money to 
Roland&#39;s register clerk, she turned to glare at the man behind her. 
&quot;Your blatant staring is going to earn you trouble,&quot; Tifa ground out, 
the threat in her voice something she picked up from Yuffie.

Chauncey only winked at her. &quot;Sorry, I can&#39;t help it.&quot;

&quot;Behave,&quot; Roland warned from his place next to the cashier clerk. He 
patted Tifa&#39;s hand as he handed her her dress, which was folded neatly 
and placed in a striped white and lime-green box. &quot;Don&#39;t mind him. He 
can be a bit uncouth but he&#39;s really too stupid to know any better.&quot;

Tifa leaned forward and asked in a hasty whisper, &quot;How are you possibly 
related to him!?&quot;

Roland leaned forward and breathed back quickly, &quot;He&#39;s a distant cousin, 
twice removed. Used to come and bother me for money, but after his 
sudden luck at Gold Saucer, he&#39;s finally begun paying me back. He isn&#39;t 
bad, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend getting involved romantically with him.&quot;

Tifa smiled dryly. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t dream of it.&quot;

&quot;Hey, hey, hey now!&quot;

The two quickly straightened again as Chauncey appeared at Tifa&#39;s side. 
He raised an eyebrow at them both. &quot;What&#39;s with the secretiveness?&quot;

Roland crossed his arms and shifted his weight to one foot, a gesture 
that reinforced Tifa&#39;s belief that the man was gay. &quot;None of your 
business, Chauncey. Now leave this poor woman alone! She&#39;s got better 
things to do, don&#39;t you?&quot; The sprite young man said, turning to Tifa at 
his last words.

Tifa smiled back at him. &quot;I actually should get going. I think my 
friend&#39;ll be looking for me.&quot; she held out her hand. &quot;Thank you so much, 
Roland!&quot;

The man took her hand gently and kissed the back of it. &quot;It was my 
pleasure, dear.&quot; he straightening, he added with a cheeky grin. &quot;You 
tell me how your &#39;friend&#39; likes that dress of yours.&quot;

Tifa blushed as she realized what Roland was alluding to. Opening her 
mouth, she was set to correct him when Chauncey interjected sharply, his 
face a scowl. &quot;Her friend is a girl, Roland.&quot;

Roland gazed at him coolly. &quot;So?&quot;

Chauncey gazed down at Tifa in confusion, his thick eyebrows clashing 
together over his blue eyes. Clearing her throat awkwardly, the woman 
nodded at Roland. &quot;Well, uh, g&#39;bye Roland. Thanks again.&quot;

Quickly she turned to leave.

As she exited the store and entered the warm afternoon air she heard the 
clop of boots behind her and sighed.

&quot;Hey wait a minute!&quot; came the call, but Tifa ignored it and kept on 
walking.

Within a moment Chauncey had fallen step alongside her and was giving 
her a searching look. &quot;Eh, is what he said back there, true?&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Tifa asked, not looking at the man&#39;s face. She stopped at the 
street corner and looked up and down the street for a sign of a taxi. 
When she saw none, the woman let out a sound of frustration.

Chauncey glared at her in annoyance. &quot;You know who I&#39;m talking about! 
Roland! Is it true what he said?&quot;

Tifa clenched her jaw. &quot;You know, I really don&#39;t need to answer that.&quot;

&quot;Like you really didn&#39;t need to tell me who you were?&quot;

&quot;Exactly.&quot;

&quot;You know for someone as famous as you, I&#39;d think you wouldn&#39;t be so 
prone to mixed messages. The public can say a lot of things. Bad things. 
Now is it true?&quot;

Tifa&#39;s gaze turned furious and she glared at the man venomously. &quot;Do not 
speak to me like that, Chauncey. You have no right to.&quot;

The man held up his hands. &quot;I&#39;m sorry...but please, I just wanna to 
know.&quot;

The woman rolled her eyes and turned her gaze away from him. Hugging the 
box to her chest she bit out, &quot;No. There&#39;s nothing between me and 
Yuffie.&quot;

The man nodded, sighing in what seemed relief. &quot;Good.&quot; he said. Tifa&#39;s 
muscles bunched at his words and she stepped away as he took a step 
toward her. &quot;I thought I didn&#39;t have a chance there for a second...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re much too bold. You speak as if you had a chance to begin with.&quot; 
Tifa returned coldly.

Chauncey chuckled. Running a hand through his hair, he took a step back. 
&quot;Your a spitfire. Just like your friend...so she was Yuffie Kisaragi, 
huh? Man, all the stories about her are true then...&quot; he chuckled again, 
shaking his head. &quot;She&#39;s a hellcat, that one.&quot;

Tifa whipped around, her anger now bubbling over. Hands clutching at her 
packaged dress so that her fingers bent the box, the fighter advanced 
dangerously toward Chauncey. &quot;You don&#39;t know anything about her!&quot; the 
woman nearly shouted.

Chauncey, surprised, stared down at her, his blue eyes wide behind his 
sunglasses. Then his smile slowly came back onto his face, and he 
laughed slightly. &quot;Easy, easy! I meant no harm by it! Your friend&#39;s a 
strong and independent girl, she&#39;s not afraid to be herself and says 
EXACTLY what&#39;s on her mind! I admire that...but for all her huffing and 
puffing that still won&#39;t stop me from trying to get to you.&quot;

Tifa blinked and turned, stepping away from him. Taking a deep breath, 
she said with a face that still spoke of displeasure, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I 
didn&#39;t mean to be so rude.&quot; She quirked an eyebrow. &quot;But I&#39;ll be frank. 
You&#39;re an arrogant, condescending jerk who thinks little of women. ...I 
don&#39;t like you. At all.&quot;

Chauncey was once again shocked into silence. He stared at Tifa&#39;s back 
with slack mouth, his arms hanging limp at his sides. Clearing his 
throat, he rubbed the back of his neck ruefully. &quot;Well heck,&quot; he 
muttered.

At the sound of his voice, Tifa felt a pang of guilt. Turning her head 
slightly to sneak a peek at the man, she wondered silently if she had 
gone too far.

Chauncey sighed and shoved his hands into his pockets. &quot;Well...you&#39;ll be 
standing there for a while. It&#39;s nearing late afternoon, and everyone&#39;s 
achin&#39; to have a taxi ride, same as you. I can give you a lift...if you 
want, that is.&quot;

Tifa tongued her cheek and shifted her weight to one foot. Looking up 
and down the street, she willed a taxi to round the corner.

Chauncey raised his eyebrows expectantly. &quot;Well?&quot;

Tifa closed her eyes and grit her teeth.

Slowly turning, she gave the man a guarded look. &quot;I won&#39;t fall for the 
&#39;let-me-get-something-out-of-the glove-compartment&#39; trick.&quot;

Chauncey&#39;s grin brightened.

----------

Her hair whipped behind her in a torrent as Chauncey&#39;s red sports car 
tore along the streets. The top was down and the wind howled in her 
ears. Her hands were held out in front of her, palms pressed nervously 
against the dashboard in anticipation of an impact. Turning her head, 
Tifa cried over the wind. &quot;Aren&#39;t you going a little fast!?&quot;

Chauncey, who was leaning back in his seat and driving with one hand, 
smirked at her. &quot;The speed&#39;s half the fun, sweetheart! You want to get 
back to your hotel quick, don&#39;t you!?&quot;

Tifa grit her teeth as the car flew over a small rise in the road. 
Bouncing in her seat as the car came back down, she snapped. &quot;I&#39;d also 
like to be in one piece if that is at all possible!&quot;

Smiling complacently, the man eased his foot off the pedal, shifting 
gear as he did so. Glancing at her, he asked jovially, &quot;That better?&quot;

Tifa glowered at him. &quot;Much.&quot; was her dry response.

Pulling a stray strand out of her eyes, the woman ran a hand over the 
door. &quot;Is this car new?&quot; she asked curiously, now relaxing some.

Chauncey shook his head. &quot;It&#39;s restored.&quot;

Frowning, she looked at him, &quot;A Shinra model?&quot;

The man nodded, absently smoothing the soul patch beneath his lip. 
&quot;Altered the frame and body. The hardware is still the same beneath the 
hood though.&quot;

Tifa nodded. &quot;I&#39;ve got a truck back at my home...it doesn&#39;t work at all, 
though.&quot;

&quot;What model is that one?&quot;

&quot;The M3-S truck.&quot;

&quot;...Ain&#39;t those the ones with the mako engines?&quot;

&quot;Yes. But I&#39;ve been trying to see if I can fix it with a mechanical 
one...I&#39;m no good at cars, though.&quot;

Chauncey laughed loudly, covering his mouth with a rough hand. Tifa 
gazed at him indignantly. &quot;What?&quot; she asked sharply.

The man shook his head, &quot;Hon, it doesn&#39;t matter that you aren&#39;t a 
mechanic. The M3-S trucks are impossible to fix with any thing but the 
mako engine. And, well, you and your pals made certain mako would never 
be used like that again, so... Sorry to tell you, but that thing will 
never work, even under the most skilled mechanic&#39;s hands!&quot;

Tifa blinked at him.

The sports car slowed as it came to a red light. Chauncey pulled a 
carton of cigarettes from inside his jacket. &quot;You don&#39;t mind if I smoke 
do you?&quot; he asked, looking at her.

Pleased that he asked before lighting, Tifa nodded. &quot;Go ahead. I don&#39;t 
mind.&quot;

The man smiled gratefully at her and pulling out a lighter, lit the tip. 
He took a long drag as he sat back. Tifa looked down at her box, 
mourning the smashed sides. Chauncey, looking around as he tapped his 
cigarette over the edge of the car, spied something off in the distance.

Tapping Tifa&#39;s shoulder, he pointed to the bakery on the opposite left 
side of the street. &quot;Hey, ain&#39;t that your friend over there?&quot;

Tifa&#39;s eyes snapped up at this, and she leaned forward as she looked. 
&quot;What? Where?&quot;

Chauncey pointed again. &quot;Right there, right over there. She&#39;s talking to 
some redhead.&quot;

The woman&#39;s eyes finally found Yuffie&#39;s face in the dimly lit store, and 
she froze at what she saw.

The ninja was indeed speaking to a redhead, but the look on her face was 
what caused Tifa&#39;s heart to freeze. She was wearing the same saucy look 
she had given Tifa before. The fighter could recognize the predatory 
smile, the bright, leering eyes...

A fire burned in the woman. All at once she felt betrayed, hurt, and 
angry. The emotions coursed through her like a poison, numbing her limbs 
and causing her mind to go white. The redhead Yuffie was speaking to was 
slightly shorter than her and was wearing a light blue dress that 
brushed coyly about her knees as she stepped forward to whisper 
something in the ninja&#39;s ear. At the sight of Yuffie closing her eyes 
and smiling indulgently, Tifa looked away, suddenly feeling sick. 
Chauncey frowned and leaned forward to stare at the two girls.

&quot;Hey, what...&quot; he raised an eyebrow. &quot;Is your friend a dyke? I think I 
just saw that redhead give her a bit of paper.&quot;

Tifa looked up pointedly. Thanking the heavens, she saw they had a green 
light. &quot;Just go.&quot; she said tersely, closing her eyes.

Wisely keeping silent, Chauncey did as he was told.

Arriving at the hotel, Tifa wanted nothing more than to wipe her mind of 
what she had seen. &quot;It shouldn&#39;t bother me so much...&quot; the woman thought 
angrily. &quot;I did turn her down, after all.&quot; Her eyes softened as she 
stepped out of Chauncey&#39;s car. &quot;But still...she wastes no time, does 
she?&quot;

Stepping onto the sidewalk, Tifa smiled half-heartedly at Chauncey. 
Though grateful for the ride, she knew she wouldn&#39;t have seen what she 
had if she had only waited for a taxi on her own. &quot;Thank you, Chauncey.&quot; 
she said, her voice dejected.

The man waved away the thanks. &quot;No thanks required...&quot; his face became 
puzzled, then he grinned cheekily up at her. &quot;Hey, now that I know your 
real name, can I call you Tifa?&quot;

Tifa laughed slightly. &quot;Sure, if you&#39;d like.&quot;

A pause.

The fighter bit her lip and took a step back toward the hotel, 
&quot;Well...thank you, Chauncey. You take care now.&quot;

The man looked disappointed. &quot;So there&#39;s no way for me to see you 
again?&quot;

The woman shook her head. Opening her mouth, she intended to give her 
answer verbally when she paused.

Stepping forward carefully, Tifa leaned down toward the car.

&quot;Well, actually...if you&#39;re not doing anything tonight...&quot;
