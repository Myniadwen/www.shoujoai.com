<a href="../ff7/waiting-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>The Ancient sat up on the bed and looked down at the bewildered Tifa and 
giggled.

Aeris: &quot;I knew you&#39;d come.&quot;

Tifa: &quot;...What is this?&quot;

Aeris: &quot;The Promised Land! Where ever, what ever, and who ever you want to 
be is here. Supreme happiness. Everything is made up, tailored to you.&quot;

Tifa: &quot;...Are you real?&quot;

Aeris: &quot;I&#39;m the real thing. The Aeris you know.&quot;

She jumped off the bed and ran down the steps and hugged Tifa tightly.

Aeris: &quot;I never knew you&#39;d want ME.&quot;

Both girls fell silent. Aeris looked up slightly at the taller girl she was 
hugging and smiled. Tifa returned the gaze to the tinier girl and stared 
into her bright green eyes. She didn&#39;t say anything. Aeris spoke first.

Aeris: &quot;Would you like your hair brushed?&quot;

Tifa laughed softly and agreed to it. Aeris took her hand and pulled her 
along, to the edge of the bed. She sat on it, just like last time and Aeris 
kneeled on the mattress, behind Tifa. She began brushing her hair, softly 
with the same brush as before. The hand that Aeris was holding her brush 
with glowed brightly. With each stroke Tifa changed. Her wrinkled skin 
tightened, her body regressing in age. Her hair blackened and filled in. Her 
eyes had more life. Her lips were more full. Her hands were softer. Tifa&#39;s 
body had become young again, back to her earlier days, the body of a 20 year 
old. Aeris put the brush down and smiled

Aeris: &quot;See? You&#39;re beautiful again!&quot;

Tifa lifted her hands and stared dumbfounded. Aeris leaned infront of Tifa&#39;s 
gaze. Then she kissed her lips and fell into Tifa&#39;s lap, off balanced from 
leaning so far. Tifa hadn&#39;t been expecting it and let out a tiny yelp. Both 
of them giggled afterwards and she looked down at the cute girl across her 
legs.

Tifa: &quot;...I never got to tell YOU... I was too afraid... but you&#39;re so 
pretty!&quot;

The older girl blushed and their eyes met. Aeris extended her hand and 
rubbed it on Tifa&#39;s cheek lightly. In response, she gasped at the touch.

Aeris: &quot;What&#39;s the matter?...&quot;

Tifa: &quot;Nothing... I&#39;m just so nervous... I&#39;ve never done anything like 
this... even with Cloud.&quot;

Aeris: &quot;Really?&quot;

Tifa: &quot;We just slept next to each other... not WITH each other...&quot;

Aeris: &quot;Well, I&#39;ve never done this before, either... we can go slow.&quot;

They both hugged one another and pulled close together. Aeris whispered in 
her ear softly.

Aeris: &quot;I&#39;d love to see... more of you.&quot;

She kissed Tifa again and pushed her tongue into her mouth. Tifa moaned and 
closed her eyes, feeling Aeris&#39; tongue explore her mouth. Aeris sat up and 
pushed Tifa onto her back. She tickled the girl underneath her on the ribs 
and under her arms. Then she leaned down and kissed her neck and shoulders, 
clasping her somewhat muscular arms in her hands. Aeris slipped her hands 
underneath the straps of Tifa&#39;s shirt and tugged it off. Tifa felt a little 
frightened, Aeris could see her breasts.

Aeris: &quot;Your chest is so beautiful!&quot;

Tifa: &quot;No it&#39;s not... my breasts are too big... they&#39;re ugly...&quot;

Aeris: &quot;Don&#39;t say such things!&quot;

She cupped her hand and held one of Tifa&#39;s breasts in her palm, gently 
massaging it. Aeris pinched her nipple teasingly and brought her mouth to 
it, sucking on her breast. Tifa groaned loudly and rolled her head back and 
forth from the pleasure it caused. Weakly, she lifted her arms and 
unbuttoned Aeris&#39; pink dress. It fell off of her and onto the bed. She 
looked over Aeris, in her bra and panties. Aeris was licking both of Tifa&#39;s 
nipples alternately and squeezing her breasts.

Tifa: &quot;Oooh... Ahhh...&quot;

She licked a trail from Tifa&#39;s chest, down her stomach, and her tongue 
wiggled over her belly button. Aeris tugged at the other girl&#39;s shorts, and 
they slid down her legs, and off her body.

Aeris: &quot;You&#39;re adorable in only panties!&quot;

Tifa blushed heavily and flipped over, and pinned Aeris on her back.

Tifa: &quot;Let me take the lead for a bit.&quot;

Without waiting for a response, Tifa unsnapped Aeris&#39; bra and squeezed the 
tinier breasts together, while kissing Aeris&#39;s mouth heavily. This continued 
for a few minutes, both unwilling to break the kiss. Tifa rubbed her hand 
over Aeris&#39; crotch and pulled her pink lacy panties off of her. Hesitating 
for only a second, she looked into Aeris&#39; eyes.

Aeris: &quot;Mmmmm...&quot;

Tifa: &quot;Should I?&quot;

Aeris: &quot;Yes...&quot;

She moved down between Aeris&#39; legs and twirled her pubic hair in her finger.

Tifa: &quot;I&#39;ve.... I&#39;ve always wanted to do this with you... Never said it 
though... afraid of what you and Cloud would think.&quot;

Aeris: &quot;So have I... you&#39;re so beautiful and sweet...&quot;

She gasped as Aeris slid a finger into her sex, and kissed her legs. Tifa 
slid a second and third finger into her, and pushed them in and out of 
Aeris, a moan coming from Aeris&#39; lips each time. With a high pitched scream, 
Aeris came, her juices leaking on to Tifa&#39;s hand. Panting heavily, Aeris 
smiled at Tifa warmly and they kissed again. Tifa pulled off her panties and 
they hugged, their bodies pressing into eachother.

Aeris wiggled her body down to Tifa&#39;s pelvis and licked her thighs. Tifa 
responded by closing her eyes and smiling, her back arched. The blonde began 
licking Tifa&#39;s &#39;other&#39; lips and pushed them apart, her tongue probing Tifa&#39;s 
inner areas. Aeris held her hips and pushed her tongue in and out of Tifa&#39;s 
sex, a low groan escaping Tifa. She found her clit, and bit it gently. With 
that, Tifa came on Aeris&#39; face, making her all sticky. They both fell back 
on to the bed, and looked at into their eyes.

Tifa: &quot;I love you Aeris...&quot;

Aeris: &quot;So do I... I love you too...&quot;

They laid there with their arms around eachother and their legs intertwined 
for awhile.

Tifa: &quot;I want to stay here forever with you...&quot;

Aeris: &quot;You can... and now you are...&quot;

Both smiled at eachother and they kissed a final time before falling asleep.
***********************************

Marlene walked into the room where Tifa lay in her bed. She looked over 
towards Tifa, and noticed something was wrong.

Marlene: &quot;Oh my god... please no...&quot;

Nanaki, who had been sleeping in the living room of the house, padded in, 
woken by Marlene walking around. He noticed her yell and saw her run over to 
the bed and shake Tifa. Her body didn&#39;t respond. She didn&#39;t breathe at all. 
Nanaki held his head low and a tear formed in the beast&#39;s eye.

Marlene: &quot;Tifa-mama! Wake up! Wake up!!&quot;

Nanaki: &quot;Let her be... she&#39;s finally at peace with the planet...&quot;

The woman began to cry, and covered her face. She wiped the tears from her 
eyes and looked towards Tifa&#39;s body while talking to Nanaki.

Marlene: &quot;...I hope she&#39;ll be happy...&quot;

Nanaki thought for a moment, and calmy replied to her.

Nanaki: &quot;She is... I know it... I&#39;ll be waiting to see her again...&quot;
