<h1>I'll Be Waiting For You... (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a>

<pre>&quot;What one dreams of, is what they desire. Subconcious ideas are spawned from
the tiniest emotion. When the scale tips to the extremes, lives are changed
forever. What would happen if you chose to go on, and find another love?&quot;

The muffled whispers were all she could hear. It was telling her something...
but what? She seemed engulfed in warmth and love when she heard it caress her
ears. 

&quot;...Or what if you decided to stay behing, glaring into the void? Never to feel
what you were destined too? I&#39;ll be waiting for you Tifa...&quot;

Her head jerked back. The voice echoed in her head, though she technically
never heard it.

Tifa: &quot;It was Aeris... I saw her... Cloud?&quot; 

She looked around... it was 4:00 A.M. Glancing over to the other side of the
lumpy bed, she noticed it was empty. The ruffled sheets and pillows where
pushed down and away where it&#39;s occupant had just been recently.

Softly she said aloud: &quot;Where is Cloud?&quot;

Something must be wrong... or so she thought. Deciding it was best to look for
him, she got up and looked into the mirror that was positioned in the corner of
the crowded room. Her silky brown hair was matted to her neck, she had been
perspiring. 

Tifa (thinking): &quot;Sweat...? Why would I sweat after THAT dream?&quot;

Upon closer inspection of her reflexion, she could see her cheeks were flushed.
The rosy color stood out against her normally pale complexion. This only made
her look more younger then she was.

Tifa (thinking): &quot;Odd... that only happens when I&#39;m near Cloud...&quot;

Then, a knock at the door. Casually, she walked over to the door and opened it.
Seemingly there was no one at the door... until she glanced down. The four
legged animal was very familiar and she knew who the beast was almost
immediately. 

Tifa: &quot;Nanaki! I haven&#39;t seen you in months! What&#39;s going on?&quot; she said coyly.

Nanaki: &quot;I was on Pilgrimage, to remind me of my past. It helps me grow
stronger. I came to Gold Saucer earlier today. Around an hour ago, I saw Cloud
at the Battle Arena. He told me not to tell you, he&#39;s going for the record. He
didn&#39;t want you there, afraid you would try to stop him if something happened.&quot;

Tifa: &quot;I&#39;m used to it... but I should have known that&#39;s where to find him... He
always has to prove himself...&quot;

She faked a heavy sigh, as if she WASN&#39;T used to this already. Tifa had come to
love almost everything about him. This was just one of his other querks that
made him special to her.

Nanaki chuckled silently to himself at that statement. She never failed to
amaze him.

Nanaki: &quot;Well, hurry up and get dressed, he&#39;s not going to be waiting, as you
know!&quot;

She looked down at her body, she was only wearing her nightgown, which barely
reached her knees when she was standing. The top was low cut, making her chest
stick out a little too far for Cloud&#39;s comfort. Tifa thought 
about that and started to get all flustered.

Tifa (thinking): Cloud... arrr... he doesn&#39;t seem to catch on to what I&#39;m
saying... ever...&quot;

Tifa (aloud): &quot;Oops!&quot; 

She blushed at the embarrassment, but Nanaki assured her it was okay. They were
good friends, but only that. Besides, he didn&#39;t feel that way towards her, they
were different species anyway. After convincing her this, he turned and padded
out of the room and walked solemly to the arena. 
As soon as he was out of sight, she ran over to her dresser, pulled out her
clothes, and sat at the edge of the bed. She hastily took off her nightgown and
shivered as the cold air touched her whole body. Not wanting to prolong this
feeling, she grabbed her tank top and slipped it over her neck and adjusted it
accordingly to cover any areas that weren&#39;t suitable in public. Glancing down
at the floor, Tifa saw her shorts. Carefully she put them on and they hugged
the curves of her hips. Then, she grabbed her boots and put them on one by one.
After finishing, she ran to the door and into the hall.
