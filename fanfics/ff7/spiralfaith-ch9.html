&#147;How did you guess?&#148;

&#147;Just figured.&#148;  &#147;Nothing is probable in this world.&#148;
__________________________________________________________________

(Monday, May 13)  In town:

Yuffie went into town to get some supplies for school (Her short break 
was almost over) and was on her way home.  But she got side tracked, 
and is still in town.  Some one was following her during her whole 
shopping trip.   The some one wore a black cloak that covered all 
features of their body that might give away anything important about 
them (Eyes, hair, gender etc&#133;).  Yuffie has run all around the town 
and now it is getting tiring.  She hates to run, but she can&#146;t just 
attack her stalker with any solid evidence.   She finally stops at a 
large stone fountain that rests in front of a large politic building.  

Yuffie stops and sets down all of what she bought (some pencils, led, 
paper and other essential items).  She then turns to confront her 
stalker.  &#147;What do you want,&#148; she questions, staring her strait where 
she thinks her eyes are.

&#147;For your&#146; friends punishment, &#147; a low, feminine voice answers (her 
tone mellow and cool), &#147;Unfortunately she best way to get to her is 
threw you.&#148;  

&#147;What are you talking about?&#148; yells the young woman.

The cloaked hunter of lives pulls out a large blade that clamps on to 
her arm (but it isn&#146;t just a bladed it also has a gun that can fire 
three bullets capable of killing a close range, and only stunning at a 
distance).   &#147;Your&#146; lover disgraced the Assassin guild I just quit.&#148;

&#147;So why do you care,&#148; Yuffie screams loudly.

&#147;I quit do to the ridiculous rule that I can&#146;t kill unless 
contracted.&#148;  She looks up at the sky and sighs, &#147;I quit to give their 
pride back.&#148;  Yuffie opens her mouth ready to speak again, but the 
Guilder was done talking, she was ready to regain the pride, which was 
supposedly lost.  She points her left hand out at Yuffie and begins to 
focus her energy into her index finger (the only finger extended).  A 
blue aura surrounds the female&#146;s whole body then moves on to her hand 
(left).  After chanting a few words a blue beam launches out (more of 
a bullet (like Yu Yu Hakusho)) and hits the fountain, blasting a large 
whole in it. Water gushes out on top of Yuffie but it isn&#146;t enough to 
knock her off her feet.  The guilder then points her gun (blade) at 
Yuffie and launches a bullet (meaning not to miss this time).  The 
ex-ninja gracefully doges the bullet and moves in for her attack.  She 
throws her fist widely at the assassin master, but can&#146;t land a hit 
(due to her opponents great agility that rivaled her own).  The 
guilder throws one punch of her own that hits the younger fighter 
directly in her forehead, Yuffie falls over.  She opens her eyes to a 
blade staring her strait in the face.  With one swift movement the 
guilder&#133;


The Office:

For once in her life Spin allowed Amber to go with her to work.  She 
never let her go prior because most causes have a lot of danger 
(Yuffie teaches martial arts to the Green Army with some of her free 
time), and she would worry too much.  Today, though, is different.  
All they would do today is go to work and get new information on 
Kerek/Zero, then they would take the day off (mostly to think some 
stuff over).


In Town: The Fountain:

A loud boom echoes threw the streets and alleyways.  The Giulder falls 
to the ground with smoke flowing from the back of her cloak.  A man 
with a metallic glove (with smoke flowing from it as well).  His hair 
is short and blue (spiked in the back), and his eyes are blue as well.  
Covering his body is a white trench coat and many belts on his waist 
and stomach (Final Fantasy style). &#147;You okay&#148; he asks, his voice quite 
and tire sounding (like he has had a long day). 

&#147;Yeah,&#148; Yuffie sighs.  Her attention is diverted to the once stunned 
Guilder whom is now moving and getting up.  She raises her hand 
(extending her index finger) and starts chanting. &#147;Um, we should 
move,&#148; yells Yuffie running to the left. 

The mysterious man just smiles widely and looks at the Guilder.  She 
fires her blue blast out at him.  He holds up his hand (right) and 
says a few words.  Then with a flash of blue, the beam flies off into 
a car, which is passing by. 

&#147;No, it can&#146;t be.&#148; She yells, her voice cracking with fear.  


Spin and Amber&#146;s Apartment:

&#147;Son of a bitch&#148; Tifa yells from the bed.  

&#147;What?&#148; Spin returns from the kitchen (with Ice-cream in hand (enough 
for every one))

&#147;I just found something out, that is really weird,&#148; Tifa states 
vaguely.  Spin hands Tifa and Amber their ice cream.  &#147;You remember 
when Kerek/Zero was first sighted.&#148;  Spin nods, taking a bite out of 
her ice cream.    &#147;Well the day before he came here, a fourteen year 
old boy collapsed in front of a computer.&#148;

Spin chokes on her ice cream (which causes Amber to pat her on her 
back), &#147;You&#146;re kidding, so what does it mean?&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t really know,&#146; Tifa sighs (after taking a bite), &#147;but there is 
more.&#148;  

&#147;More&#148; Amber asks.

&#147;It also turns out that the kid was writing a story on the Internet 
about a pink ball that destroys everything.&#148;

&#147;So we have our author.&#148; 

&#147;Didn&#146;t Kerek say that in his memories he is fourteen,&#146; asks Amber.

&#147;Tifa, it can&#146;t be that those two are related somehow, can they?&#148; 
ponders Tifa aloud.  

The Fountain: Again:

&#147;Why are you helping her,&#146; Screams the Guilder.

&#147;Oh Kiah, why are you trying to kill a girl, is she your&#146; target?&#148;

&#147;No, but Tifa has disgraced our Guild, now move you bastard.&#148;

&#147;Our Guild, I quite remember.&#148;

&#147;Dammit Lea. You ruined it again!&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t care if you go after the detectives, but don&#146;t go after their 
lovers&#148; he sighs before leaving.
