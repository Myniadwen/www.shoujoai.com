		     4. REUNION OF VENGEANCE


Midnight, in the city of Junon. Little was moving, it was dark, and the
fog of night shrouded the streets. Troops of the night watch slowly
strolled up and down the main quay, half asleep, hardly noticing anything.
Just then a young woman emerges from a building, and scurries along the
shadows to an alley way, between two of the buildings. She goes to the
bottom of a stairway to a nearly deserted bar, where a few strange
characters has assembled at a table for a drink.

&quot;Well Uni, what&#39;s the story?&quot; &quot;Well Aki.....Our girl inside
the base says that Aeris is heavily guarded.
They&#39;re gonna be moving her at dawn to the port.
Ohh....oh.... Aki!&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;There&#39;s a shop full of prostitutes on one
of the higher levels! Can we get one? Pleeeeeeeeease!&quot; &quot;Uni. Why would
we want one? You can have it on with any of our girls.&quot; &quot;But....but..&quot;
&quot;Tell you what, we&#39;ll make love when we get back, just you, and me.&quot;
&quot;Thanks Aki, but one of the girls up there looks just like Colette!
Colette won&#39;t have it on with me, so I want the next best thing.&quot;

&quot;Awww, she wouldn&#39;t? Does she want to do one of your friends?&quot; &quot;Huh?
Well.... she likes Anna....&quot; &quot;Then offer to set her up with Anna, in
return for sex.&quot; &quot;Will that work?&quot; &quot;It&#39;s worked before! Now, go hook
up with the girls on the roof.&quot; &quot;Kay! Bye!&quot;

&quot;Awwwwww! Your like a mommy to them.&quot; &quot;Yea Tifa. Only 28 and a mother to
50 girls! Except no mother I know has to juggle 50 sex-lives at once!&quot;
&quot;Not enough time for your own?&quot; She looks down at the table. &quot;No. Tifa..
Guys....I take anyone who kills even one of my girls very seriously.
We might be here to get Aeris, but in the end, I&#39;m here to get Typhon,
and any other Shinra suprimeo I can find. I&#39;m gonna kill him if it&#39;s the
last thing I do.&quot;

------------------------

&quot;It&#39;s 01:00 Mr. President, time to go.&quot; Rufus and his senior staff were
in the main Junon office, overlooking the ocean. Rufus turned and looked
out the window, at the pitch black ocean of the night.
&quot;It&#39;s so close, I can feel it.
My days as a mortal will soon be over.&quot;
Scarlet walks over to Rufus and hangs off him seductively.
&quot;Rufus, honey, do we really have to go this early,
the night hasn&#39;t even begun.&quot; He ignored her
and everyone watched him as he walked over
to the scientist who just entered the room.

&quot;Hojo, is it ready?&quot; &quot;See for yourself.&quot; A couple of soldiers wheel in
what looks like a metal coffin, with a rounded glass top. Rufus looks
at it and sees a naked Aeris, lying sound asleep inside. &quot;She&#39;ll remain
out-cold, in total stasis, until we reach Nibleheim.&quot; &quot;Excellent! It&#39;s
time we go then.&quot; &quot;Sir....what about the AVALANCHE security leak?&quot;
Asked Typhon desperately. &quot;Ah yes.&quot; Rufus looks around at all the
security and office personnel in the room. &quot;The spy is with the
Midnight Streakers, kill all the female personnel in this room.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir!&quot; With that Typhon pulls out a pistol and
starts shooting all the female soldiers. Some just stood,
rooted to the spot as Typhon and his men mowed them down.
Those that ran got treated to a sub-machine gun.
&quot;Now...wasn&#39;t that easy? Commander Briggs,
take command of Junon, while we&#39;re gone.&quot; &quot;Sir! Yes sir!&quot;
The entourage leave the room and head for the stair-well.

One of the female soldiers, was lying on the ground, half-dead,
in a pool of her own blood. Using the last ounces of her strength,
she pulls a radio communicator from her pocket.
&quot;(Tell.....tell...Aki...they...they ....they.....*cough*....)&quot;
Briggs saw what she was doing and shot her in the head
with his pistol. &quot;Fucking rebel scum, burn in hell.&quot;
&quot;Sir.... We could have interrogated her.&quot; &quot;Oh.....my bad.&quot;

--------------

One of Aki&#39;s girls was atop a transmitter pylon,
co-ordinating the rebel com traffic. &quot;Sally?!......Sally?!
Come in! Come in! Oh man! Damn it. Aki! Come in Aki!
This is Com Central.&quot; &quot;THIS IS AKI, WHAT IS IT.&quot;
&quot;Our girl inside the base is gone, I think she&#39;s dead, I heard some
gunfire.&quot; &quot;SHINRA KID FUCKERS!! OK.....KEEP ME INFORMED.&quot;

--------------

&quot;What&#39;s wrong Aki? What happened?&quot; Aki looked down at the table.
&quot;They just killed another one of my girls.&quot; &quot;Ohh.....Aki, i&#39;m sorry.&quot;
Tifa moved closer to Aki and hugged her tightly.
The guys were sitting across the table watching all this.
&quot;Is it just me Cloud, or is the whole world turned lesbian?&quot;
&quot;How should I know Barrett? I don&#39;t see enough women in my life.&quot;
Red was right beside them and was sobering up after being stoned on
Crazy Greens. &quot;Hey! What the?! Where am I? Cloud?&quot; &quot;We&#39;re in Junon,
we&#39;re going to get Aeris back.&quot;

&quot;After that, we should go to Cosmo Canyon.&quot; &quot;Why Red?&quot; &quot;This is all
about Mako right? Well, my granddad knows everything, he&#39;ll know how
to stop Rufus&#39; plan, what ever it is.&quot; &quot;Sound&#39;s good.&quot;

&quot;AKI, AKI COME IN.&quot; &quot;Yes, this is Aki, what is it?&quot;
&quot;LATEST FROM THE ROOF COMMAND, WE&#39;VE TAKEN THE HIGHWIND,
THE BASE DON&#39;T REALISE IT YET.&quot;
&quot;Excellent, tell them to get ready for take off,
we may need you for a quick escape.&quot;

&quot;The Highwind?! What the fuck are you doing
stealing the Shinra flagship?!&quot;
&quot;You&#39;ve started to loose it Barrett, wasn&#39;t it you who took
Shinra&#39;s prototype SuperTank, and drove it through their gates?&quot;
&quot;A SuperTank against RoadKillers is one thing,
but the Highwind against Gelnikas?! I don&#39;t think so!&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a just a backup, I hope we don&#39;t need it.&quot;

------------------

An armoured convoy leaves the main building, defended by tanks.
It was made up of 2 armoured limos, 3 APCs,
and a small cargo carrier. In the first limo, Typhon, Heidegger,
Robin, and other security staff  were talking things over.
&quot;I&#39;m incredibly pissed off with you Typhon. The 5th Regiment cost
us 5 BILLION Gil in equipment alone. If Rufus wasn&#39;t so fucked up
with this &#39;God&#39; business, he&#39;d be gunning for MY blood.&quot;

&quot;Apologies General Heidegger sir! There was no way to anticipate
that those girls could fight that well.
If we had been warned....&quot;
&quot;NO EXCUSES! Your a soldier, you should expect
the unexpected.&quot; Robin spoke up. &quot;With all due respect sir.
You haven&#39;t a clue.&quot; &quot;Who the hell is this, Typhon?!&quot;
&quot;This is Major Robin sir, the finest officer to serve under me.
You&#39;d be wise to listen to him.&quot;

&quot;Go on then Major.&quot; &quot;If you gave us the same kind of intelligence,
that the Turks have we&#39;d.....&quot; Two people, a man and a woman,
in black suits, wearing shades,
who had been sitting beside Heidegger, interrupt
him. &quot;There is no way we are giving our secrets to the infantry.&quot;
&quot;Our reports are for Rufus alone.&quot;
Typhon pounds the side of the limo. &quot;TURKS! I should have known!
You spineless pricks want to keep everything to yourselves!&quot;
&quot;Now, now Typhon. Elena and the rest
of the Turks can do that. It ensures that the likes of
you never get into power.&quot;
&quot;But sir..&quot;
&quot;End of story Typhon! Now we must concentrate on the plan at hand.&quot;

------------------

One of Aki&#39;s snipers sees the convoy move onto the main quay.
&quot;Aki, this is point 5, Convoy in my point.&quot; &quot;DISCRIBE&quot;
&quot;Two limos, 3 APCs surrounding a Security Cargo Transport,
with Tank support.&quot;
&quot;HANG TIGHT, WAIT FOR ORDERS, OUT.&quot;

Aki gets up from the table. &quot;It&#39;s time.&quot; They left the bar
and went up to the alley at street level.
All the other alleys were full of Aki&#39;s girls.
On the other side of the street, several of the girls
were hanging off the quay wall, waiting to ambush.
They all stared at the tunnel under the Junon Cannon.
&quot;They have to come through here to get to the ferry.&quot;
Aki picks up her radio.

&quot;This is Aki, I want anyone who can do it, to take
out the drivers of the first limos, and the Security Cargo Transport.&quot;
Tifa looked at Aki with worrisome eyes. Aki picked up the radio again.
&quot;But be careful, the girl we&#39;re trying to rescue,
could be in either.&quot;
Aki winked at Tifa, which brought a smile to her face. &quot;Thanks Aki.&quot;

The sound of the convoy approaching echoed out of the tunnel. It
got closer, and louder, and the rebels got more trigger happy by the
second. But then......the noise began to disappear, until it was gone.
&quot;What the? Point 5 come in! Has the convoy stopped?&quot; &quot;NO AKI, CONVOY
WENT INTO THE TUNNEL.&quot; &quot;Where could it have gone? Any idea&#39;s guys?&quot;
&quot;There&#39;s a roadway running under the cannon, but it goes no-where.&quot;
Said Cloud, because he hadn&#39;t said anything for a while.

After he said that, the fog horn of a ship could be heard, from the
base of the cannon. &quot;Oh no! A ship!&quot; They all run to the quayside,
to see a heavily armoured troopship, set sail from the base of the
cannon. &quot;Shit! They must have known about us!&quot; yelled Barrett.
Suddenly a bright light shone on the rebels from above. A squadron
of helicopters had spotted them and were descending.
&quot;SURRENDER YOURSELVES! YOUR SURROUNDED!&quot; Just then, Supertanks
block off both ends of the quay. &quot;IT&#39;S A TRAP!&quot;

Aki pulls out her communicator. &quot;This is Aki on the quayside.
Get the Highwind moving, pick up the rest of the girls, then come
get us.&quot; &quot;TEN FOUR AKI, WE&#39;RE ON OUR WAY.&quot; Just then the tanks opened
fire, and they had to run into the alley for cover.

-----------------------------

Up in the Shinra Junon office,
Commander Briggs was watching the battle.
&quot;Excellent, they didn&#39;t see it coming. Where have the rebels gone?&quot;
&quot;They&#39;re taking cover in the alleyways sir,
we&#39;re going to try to box them in.......what? Sir, the Highwind just
took off, there&#39;s no response from the crew.&quot;

&quot;Damn it! Rebels have the Highwind! Rufus is going to
have my balls in a vice grip! Tell the
tanks on the quay to fire on the Highwind, when they finish with the
rebels there. Let&#39;s hope they don&#39;t destroy it.&quot; &quot;Sir?&quot; &quot;What is it?&quot;
&quot;Our tanks are being attacked by an Ifrit.&quot; &quot;HOLY SHIT! Tell them to
convert to War Mode, scramble the Gelnikas,
and get the cannon ready!&quot;

-------------------------------

A tank was thrown off the quay as it converted to War Mode. Ifrit
was ripping through the tanks like they weren&#39;t there.
&quot;Ifrit can&#39;t keep this up forever, not when they&#39;re in War Mode.
We need the Highwind now!&quot; A large explosion came from quay, and
Ifrit was thrown into a building. He disappears due to lack of
energy. &quot;Your right Cloud, this doesn&#39;t look good.&quot;
Aki picks up her radio. &quot;Highwind, we need support NOW!&quot;
&quot;WE&#39;LL BE THERE NOW...WE JUST NEED TO CLEAR THE QUAY.&quot;

Explosive charges fall on the tanks, felling them to the ground. The
Highwind lands on the quay and lowers a few rope ladders. Everyone
gets on-board. They enter the Highwind bridge as it takes off and
moves off from Junon. &quot;Alright! We&#39;re outta here!&quot; Exclaimed
Barrett. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t celebrate just yet! We&#39;ve got 2 Gelnikas on
our tail!&quot; Said one of the girls at the controls. They all look at
an image of 2 chunky aircraft following them.

&quot;Can we outrun them?&quot; &quot;Afraid not Tifa, they&#39;re much faster.&quot;
Aki comes up to the controls.
&quot;Ok then, try and dodge their fire,
we have to catch up with that troopship.&quot;
The Gelnikas swoop down and begin to attack the Highwind.
The airship swayed heavily to avoid their gunfire.
&quot;They&#39;re trying to distract us from the troopship! We have to keep
going forward.&quot; Said Cloud, remembering what he could of his Soldier
training.

The Highwind opened it&#39;s jet engines, and began to chase the
troopship. Both Gelnikas begin attacking from the right.
&quot;The Gelnikas are coming in from the right.&quot; &quot;Alright then,
go left, keep out of their line of fire.&quot;

-------------

Back in Junon, Commander Briggs was watching all this. &quot;Are they
in scope yet?&quot; A gunner views a silhouette of the airship
approach some crosshairs. &quot;In scope now sir!&quot;
&quot;FIRE CANNON!!&quot; The Junon Cannon began to charge. A loud hum
could be heard throughout the city. Then, in a thunderous blast,
the cannon fired.

-------------

&quot;Huh? AKI! JUNON CANNON! INCOMING!!!&quot; &quot;WHAT?! DIVE!!! NOW!!!!!!!&quot;
The ship began to dive quickly, but not quick enough. The cannon
fire hit the back of the balloon. Seriously damaging it, and
causing it to accelerate directly towards the troopship.
The Highwind crashes into the bow of the ship, and
was lodged in it&#39;s hull, just at the water line.

On board the Highwind, everyone began to pick themselves up.
They had been thrown against the walls as the ship began to
freefall. &quot;W..what happened.&quot; Barrett looks out the window.
&quot;Ohh shit!&quot; &quot;What is it?&quot; &quot;We&#39;re hanging off the side of
the fucking ship!&quot; Just then they could hear voices up on
the ship&#39;s deck, just before some bullets start shooting through
the windows. &quot;Soldiers are taking pot shots at us from the
deck, they&#39;ll be boarding us soon.&quot;

&quot;We have to get on to that ship now!&quot; &quot;One of my girls just said
they managed to open a vent shaft on the side of the ship, we can
get in there.&quot; &quot;Ok, we&#39;d better all go then.&quot;
They all abandon the airship, and go down the vent shaft to the
lower decks of the troopship.

&quot;Well..that was the most fucked up, one-sided battle ever.&quot;
Spouted Barrett. &quot;Hey! Where are we?!&quot;
It was dark. You could barely see anything. The whispers of the
other girls echoed throughout what appeared to be a large room.
&quot;Shh! Quite girls!&quot; &quot;Looks like we&#39;re in a cargo bay. A
fairly empty cargo bay.&quot; Muttered Red. &quot;It won&#39;t take them long
to figure out that we&#39;re here. We should capture a crew member,
and get as much information...&quot;

Just then the lights came on. A young woman in a sailor&#39;s uniform
walks across the bay carrying a box, blissfully unaware of
the 50 rebels watching her 100 metres away. She goes to put the
box on a shelf, humming some tune to herself, when she suddenly
gets the feeling that she&#39;s being watched.
She turns around to see the others. She stops humming.
The air was tense. A bead of sweat ran down her brow.
&quot;Emm.....Hi there! Hee! Hee!.......Bye!&quot;

She drops the box and darts for the door. &quot;Christie! Aoife!
Get her!&quot; Two of Aki&#39;s girls dart for the sailor at great
speed. She was about to escape through the door, but it was
too late. Christie had jumped and grabbed her by the legs,
felling her to the ground. Aoife shuts the door.
They both pick her up and pin her arms behind her back as
everyone else reached them. Aki walks up to their captive.

&quot;Well aren&#39;t you cute in your little sailor uniform. Pity it&#39;s
a Shinra uniform, for a Shinra Navy. But I won&#39;t hold it
against you. Tell us what we want, and you won&#39;t be hurt.
&quot;Never! I won&#39;t betray Shinra. You can torture me all you like,
I won&#39;t say a word.&quot; &quot;Oh. So your a fiery little cutie. We have
ways to make you talk. Ways especially for you. Colette, take
her clothes off.&quot; Colette, who was beside Aki, begins to
undo the buttons of the sailor&#39;s shirt.

&quot;No! Wait!&quot; &quot;Stop Colette. What&#39;s wrong? Don&#39;t tell me your
afraid of being stripped naked?&quot; &quot;No it&#39;s not that. It&#39;s just...
I&#39;ve heard about you guys and I know your gonna rape me.(sniff)
Please don&#39;t.(sniff)&quot; &quot;We don&#39;t do that to anyone who doesn&#39;t
deserve it. Now. Tell me everything you know, or we&#39;ll fuck you
till you do.&quot; &quot;All....alright, what do you want to know?&quot;
&quot;First, what kind of ship is this?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s very new. A ship with a replicable top section. Right now
the top section is a troop transport, but it can be changed to
a warship or even an aircraft carrier. The bottom section,
where we are, is the engine with a separate crew and systems.&quot;
&quot;Hmm....Can the troops come down to this section?&quot;

&quot;No, both sections are sealed off from each other.&quot;
&quot;That explains why there are no troops attacking. But why aren&#39;t
your crew attacking?&quot; &quot;Most are asleep or in the engine room.&quot;
&quot;How many crewmembers?&quot; &quot;About 40&quot; &quot;All female?&quot; &quot;Well...yea,
how&#39;d you know?&quot; &quot;I have contacts in Shinra, I know about the
crew but not the ship. That&#39;s all I needed to know, thank you.
Girls....take her clothes off and tie her up.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?! You promised you wouldn&#39;t rape me!&quot; &quot; I promised
nothing. Besides we just need your uniform.&quot; She&#39;s
dragged off to the far end of the cargo bay as she
struggled to free herself. &quot;A totally female crew? What&#39;s
that about Aki?&quot; Said Cloud with a confused face on him.
&quot;I don&#39;t know, I just heard that Shinra was doing this on
their newer ships, to see what happens.&quot;

Tifa let out a disheartened sigh. &quot;We&#39;ll never get to Aeris
if half the ship is sealed off.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t worry Tifa, I&#39;ll
get the girls to capture the entire crew. We&#39;ll take their
uniforms and pose as them, then we can find a way up.
There has to be a way, this ship wouldn&#39;t make sense
if there wasn&#39;t.&quot; They split in half. Tifa, Aki and some of
the girls went to the crew cabins, the rest went to the
engine room.

&quot;(Ok, we do this quickly. If we move fast enough, we&#39;ll get
them all before they know what&#39;s happening.)&quot; &quot;(What&#39;s
gonna happen now Aki?)&quot; &quot;(We capture the crew. Take their
clothes off, tie them up, then bring them to the cargo bay.
Then, hee hee, we have &#39;fun&#39; with them.)&quot; &quot;(Emm, why?)&quot;
&quot;(Well...I&#39;m running low on girls, so I&#39;m gonna recruit
the crew, by fooling around with them, make &#39;em lesbian,
and hate Shinra.)&quot; &quot;(You can&#39;t be serious, there has to
be better ways, like hypnosis or mind control?)&quot;

&quot;(Hey Tifa! I don&#39;t tell you how to do YOUR job! Hmm...
I never would anyway, I love you too much.)&quot;
&quot;(Ohh, please don&#39;t start that now.)&quot; &quot;(Well...(sigh)Ok.)&quot;
They entered the main corridor of the cabin deck.
Aki used military sign language to tell half the girls to
take one row of cabins and the rest to take the other.
She took Tifa and waited by the entrance, then made a
downward swipe with her hand, signalling them to begin.

The girls rushed in the cabins, and soon they had
disappeared, into the darkness of the poorly lit
corridor. They heard the sound of shuffling, then
muffled screams, and calls for help, then... the voices
began to die down. Replaced by sounds of struggling,
the removal and ripping of clothes, then finally the sound
of rope being stretched and tied. All the time Tifa and Aki
wait outside in the corridor.

Out of the darkness, almost like ghosts came a line of
bound and naked girls. The crew had been successfully
captured. They moved along quietly as their captors
herded them towards the cargo bay. Some had been gagged
with their own underwear. The rest were either too
ashamed, embarrassed or disheartened to speak. They just
stared at the floor as they walked, afraid of what
might happen next.

&quot;Oh, well done girls! Bring them to the cargo bay and
give them &#39;special&#39; treatment.&quot; Aki took Tifa by the
hand and began to walk up the corridor. Most the crew
had been taken, the cabins were quiet and empty. But
that silence soon ended, by screaming. &quot;No! Please!
Let me go!&quot; A young sailor was being pulled from her
cabin by 2 of Aki&#39;s girls.

&quot;Where&#39;d you find her Anna?&quot;
&quot;We caught her hiding in a closet Aki. Jill, hold her
arms back, I&#39;ll get her shirt off.&quot; Jill held the
sailor&#39;s arms behind her back as Anna began to undo
her shirt. Aki was about to move on, when she noticed
something. She looked in the girl&#39;s eyes and saw
something, she wasn&#39;t sure what. &quot;Just wait a sec
Tifa, girls, stop what your doing, I just want to...&quot;

Aki moves Anna to one side and crouches down a bit,
since the sailor was much shorter. &quot;W..what is your
name?&quot; &quot;(sniff) Crew...Crewman Holland.&quot; &quot;No, your
first name.&quot; Said Aki softly. &quot;It&#39;s...Cara...I..I
I&#39;m afraid, please let me go.&quot; Aki smiled and stroked
her head. &quot;Girls, be very gentle with her. I like her.&quot;
She&#39;s quietly walked down the corridor, towards the
the cargo bay.

&quot;Aki, why..?&quot; &quot;(sigh) She reminds me of Chu, Tifa.
I want to be kind to her, keep her safe.&quot;
&quot;Aki, you can&#39;t replace a person you know. She
isn&#39;t Chu.&quot; &quot;I know, it&#39;s just to make me feel better.
You&#39;d feel the same if Aeris ever died.&quot;
&quot;Don&#39;t say things like that! They end up happening!
Speaking of Aeris, lets try and find that way up.

They search the empty corridors of the ship, till
they found a large hatch near the centre,
with the words &#39;Emergency Exit&#39; printed
on it in English and Japanese. &quot;This looks like a
way up, I&#39;ll try and force it open.&quot; Said Tifa as
she struggled with the hatch&#39;s lever.
Aki examines a keypad on the side of the hatch.
&quot;Looks like you need to enter a code to open it.&quot;
She types a few codes in. &quot;None of the codes I know
work. I recon the captain would know what the code
is.&quot; Tifa continues to struggle with the lever.
&quot;Tifa, quit it. We have to go back to the cargo bay
and find the captain.&quot; &quot;(sigh) All right then.
(I&#39;ll be with you soon Honeybuns).&quot;

They go back to the cargo bay. The scene was a
surprise to Tifa, even though she was expecting it.
On one side of the room, Aki&#39;s girls where getting
into the crew&#39;s sailor uniforms.
On the other, the whole
crew had been arranged in rows and sat on the ground.
They were being systematically raped by half a dozen
of Aki&#39;s girls. Terrified whimpers could be heard
from the crew, drowned out by occasional moans and
screams from those who were getting &#39;special&#39;
treatment.

Tifa suddenly couldn&#39;t watch this anymore, she turned
her head to the left, only to see the guys watching
this. She walks over to them. &quot;Guys, what are you
doing just standing here?!&quot; &quot;Are you kiddin&#39; Tifa,
you&#39;d have to pay 10 Gil a night to watch this kind
of stuff, and we&#39;re getting it for free!&quot; said
Barrett with a broad smile on his face.
&quot;Cloud? What about you?&quot; &quot;I can&#39;t really do much
here. All I use is my massive sword, I&#39;d slaughter
the girls if I used it.&quot; &quot;Ohh, Red?&quot; &quot;Nah ah,
I&#39;m no good at fighting, or much else, hey, I&#39;ve
got paws, not hands!&quot;

&quot;You three are useless! Just guard this place while we
look for the captain.&quot; Tifa storms off, a bit phased,
she&#39;s never had to yell at them before. Aki was
looking through the crew for the captain, when she
noticed little Cara, on her own, to the side of the
rest of the crew. She had been stripped naked,
and gagged, with her arms had been tightly bound
behind her back. Her legs had just been tied by
Anna, who was standing over, feeling her, getting
ready to mount her. Cara was clearly upset,
waterlogged with tears.

This enraged Aki. &quot;ANNA! Get off her!!&quot; Aki storms
over to them. &quot;I told you to be gentle with her!&quot;
&quot;But I am being gentle, I did all of this very
gently, she didn&#39;t struggle or anything.&quot;
&quot;Go deal with the crew, and don&#39;t touch her again!&quot;
&quot;Erm, Yes Aki.&quot; She leaves. Aki kneels down in front
of Cara and gently removes her gag. &quot;Are you Ok?&quot;
&quot;(sniff) Uh huh...She, she didn&#39;t hurt me.&quot;
Aki smiled, then untied her legs.

&quot;My name&#39;s Aki, these are my girls, we fight Shinra
to save the planet.&quot; &quot;W...what do you want with us.
We&#39;re no match for you.&quot; &quot;I want you girls to
join my organisation, when we take the ship,
we&#39;re bringing you all with us to Condor.&quot;
&quot;So...we&#39;re prisoners then.&quot; &quot;Well, maybe some of
you, but I hope you don&#39;t feel that way, I want
you to be happy.&quot; She said as she wiped the tears
from Cara&#39;s eyes. &quot;You want me to be happy?
I....I&#39;d like to go home.&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll do anything but
that, honey! Have you got a friend, boyfriend
or even girlfriend, I could kidnap and bring to
Condor for you?&quot;

&quot;No, I have no friends, and...and my family was
killed in the Meaningless War by Wutai troops.
I lived alone in Costa Del Sol, till I joined
the navy, the place reminds me of them......
W...why are doing this for me? I&#39;m no different
to the others.&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll be honest with
you Cara, your cute and I like you, I want to
keep you safe.&quot; Cara blushed. &quot;N..no one has
ever said something that kind to me before.&quot;
She said, softly looking into Aki&#39;s eyes.

Aki was long enough in the game to be able to
read signs, she decided to chance it and kiss
her. She closed her eyes and moved her head to
Cara&#39;s and gently pressed her lips to her&#39;s.
She did this carefully, in case there was any
resistance from Cara, then she&#39;d stop, but
there wasn&#39;t any, Cara was kissing back.
Aki moved into a deeper kiss, moving her
tongue in and out, and much to her delight,
Cara was doing the same to her.

Aki pulled away for a second, only to see
Cara&#39;s blush had grown to encompass her entire
face, with a broad smile on it.
&quot;(I never thought it could feel like that,
no one&#39;s ever been that way to me before,
thank you Aki)&quot; Aki began to stroke Cara&#39;s
groin. &quot;(Want me to go a little further?)&quot;
&quot;(Emm, Ok, but be gentle..)&quot; Aki began to kiss
her again, but this time she was easing her
hand into Cara&#39;s vagina as she did, using
her thumb to play with her clit.

She inched her fingers in further, only to
be stopped, by a fleshy barrier inside
of Cara. Aki&#39;s eyes lit up with excitement.
&quot;(Cara! Your a virgin! Have you been with
anyone else before?)&quot; &quot;(No, your my
first. First kiss too. Are you going to
continue?)&quot; &quot;(No this is special, I&#39;m gonna
save it for when we get back. (sigh) Better
get back to finding your captain in this
mound of naked flesh.)&quot; &quot;Your looking for the
captain? You won&#39;t find her here. She stays
in her office in the front of the ship,
with the first officer.&quot;

&quot;Oh, thank you so much Cara! I&#39;m glad to see
your on my side now! I&#39;ll see you later.&quot;
&quot;Ahem, Aki? My arms are still tied.&quot;
&quot;Well...I don&#39;t want you escaping on me.
I&#39;ll untie you when we get back to Condor.&quot;
&quot;(sigh) Ok.&quot; &quot;If you need anything just ask
the girls. Bye.&quot;

She walks over to Tifa who was trying to fend
off some of her fan club with a barge pole.
&quot;I know where the captain is Tifa, wanna come
help me?&quot; &quot;Sure, anything to get away from
these girls of yours! They were getting too
touchy feely with me!&quot; &quot;Oh girls, come on!
Leave Tifa alone, this isn&#39;t the time or place!&quot;
They begin to move away, grumbling all the time.

The captain and her first officer were in a
large office in the front of the ship, trying
to figure out what was happening.
&quot;I sealed down the doors cap&#39;n, whoever is
out there, they&#39;re not getting in.&quot;
&quot;Good Fiona, I&#39;m trying to reach the
top section, but they&#39;re not answering.&quot;
&quot;Cap&#39;n! Look at this!&quot; She comes over to
a security monitor where Fiona was sitting.

They could see Aki and Tifa outside the
office. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Fiona, you said it
yourself, they can&#39;t get in.&quot;
Then they notice Tifa put on some gloves,
and then pound the door, it did some damage.
&quot;What the?! Those gloves must be made of
some hard compound metal, they could break
through!&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t be stupid Fiona nothing can...&quot;

She was interrupted by more pounding.
Fiona looked at the door in terror, as it
was pounded off it&#39;s hinges. Aki walks in
with a reel of rope in her right hand.
&quot;Hello Ladies. Time to join the rest of your
crew, but before that...&quot; She said as
she snapped the rope tightly between her
hands. Tifa reattached the door and locked
it behind them.

-------------------------

Up on the top section, Typhon is walking towards
the bridge. He runs into Elena and some of her
goons. He looks squarely into her eyes for a
second, almost transmitting his hatred of her and
all Turks, then continues to walk.

&quot;It&#39;s not going to work you know....&quot;
Typhon stops walking, and turns to Elena.
&quot;What?&quot; &quot;I know what your up to Commander. There&#39;s
no way it&#39;ll work, the Turks have existed since the
beginning of Shinra. Your not getting rid of us.&quot;
A sinister smile came over Typhon&#39;s face.
&quot;We&#39;ll see. Rufus likes results, and I kill our
enemies, you just toy with them.&quot;

One of Typhon&#39;s privates runs up to them.
&quot;Sir! Full search of Highwind complete. All
rebels are gone. Shall I continue search?&quot;
&quot;No soldier, I know where they are, dismissed.&quot;
He walks off. &quot;You know where they are?&quot;
Said Elena sarcastically. &quot;Of coarse, any fool
would know they&#39;re in the bottom section of
the ship, now if you&#39;ll excuse me I must
prepare something for the rebels.&quot;

He continues to walk towards the bridge.
One of the Turks turn to Elena.
&quot;This sounds serious Elena, what if manages to
close us down?&quot; &quot;Huh! Don&#39;t be stupid! He can&#39;t do
a thing. Hmm....But he does have a plan regards those
rebels, and I think I know what it is.&quot;
&quot;We could use his plan to liquidate him.&quot;
&quot;Your right he&#39;s getting too powerful,
we need get rid of him now.
Ok, you all know what you need to do.&quot;

They all nod, and walk off in every direction.

--------------------------

Back in the captain&#39;s office, Tifa and Aki had
managed to strip the captain and her first
officer, and were tieing them up. Aki had tied
the captain&#39;s arms to an overhead pipe and her
legs to a pipe near the floor. Her arms and
legs had been spread. Fiona, the first officer,
had her hands tied behind her back, and was
sitting on the desk as Tifa squatted in front,
finishing the knot tying her legs together.
Fiona hadn&#39;t resisted at all, compared the massive
fight they had stringing up the captain.

&quot;All done Aki, now what?&quot; She said as she stood
up. &quot;Now Tifa, we get some answers.&quot; Aki turned to
the captain. &quot;Ok, I&#39;ll make this simple, what&#39;s
the code to get up to the top section.&quot;
&quot;Ha! You think I&#39;ll tell you!&quot; &quot;(sigh) Not again...
Alright, tell me what I want to know, or I&#39;ll fuck
you till you do...&quot; &quot;There&#39;s nothing you can do
that&#39;ll make me!&quot;

&quot;Well..you give me no choice.&quot; Aki gets her fingers
and begins to ease them into the captain&#39;s vagina.
She then begins to violently move them around inside
her. &quot;Had enough?&quot; Said Aki as she heard some soft
moans from her. Tifa looks at the captain.
&quot;Looks like she&#39;s enjoying it Aki.&quot;
&quot;N...no she&#39;s bluffing.&quot;
&quot;Mmmmm, no....I&#39;m not bluffing, I&#39;m a lesbian....and
I haven&#39;t had any action for months, mmm, I love this...
could you suck my nipples too......ha ha ha!&quot;

This frustrated Aki, she pulled her hand out of the captain,
and punched her hard in the stomach with it, winding
her. &quot;Dammit!! Is there ANYONE who isn&#39;t lesbian in this
whole world?!!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m not a lesbian...&quot; Said Fiona suddenly.
The captain quickly recovered from Aki&#39;s punch and was
surprised by what Fiona had just said. &quot;Fiona?!&quot;
&quot;Opps...sorry cap&#39;n.&quot;

Aki smirked an evil smirk, as she menacingly walked
up to Fiona, who was still sitting on the desk.
&quot;So.....your straight. Hmm. Have you got a boyfriend?&quot;
Fiona blushed as she spoke. &quot;Well...Hee! I&#39;ve got one
back in Junon. I love him so much.&quot; &quot;FIONA?!! Idiot!&quot;
&quot;Opps!! Sorry cap&#39;n, I did it again, didn&#39;t I?&quot;

&quot;Hmm...Tifa, could you spread her legs and tie them
that way for me?&quot; &quot;Emm, sure.&quot; Tifa unties Fiona&#39;s
ankles, spreads her legs, and ties each ankle to a
drawer handle on the desk she was sitting on.
Aki removes a small torch from her pocket, and
uses it to look up, into the depths of Fiona&#39;s
vagina. &quot;Hmm...your very tight, are you a virgin?&quot;

&quot;Yea I am......Opps! I mean NO! NO I&#39;M NOT!&quot;
&quot;(Oh Fiona....)&quot; Said the captain, almost giving
up hope. &quot;Tifa, put your fingers on the mouth
of her vagina.&quot; &quot;(Huh? Why me?)&quot; &quot;(Just trust me.)&quot;
Tifa put her finger tips inside Fiona, who was now
beginning to panic.

&quot;Ok.....Fiona, isn&#39;t it?....I want to know the code
to get upstairs to the top section.&quot; &quot;I...I...
I can&#39;t tell you. It&#39;s my duty.&quot;
&quot;You&#39;ll tell me, or Tifa here will ram her hand,
all the way up!&quot; &quot;No! Please! Don&#39;t do it.&quot;
&quot;Tell me the code!!&quot; &quot;(sniff) I can&#39;t...(sniff)&quot;
She begins to cry. &quot;Fine then, maybe the pain
of losing your virginity will make you think twice.
Tifa....do it!&quot;

Tifa got ready to push her hand, all the way up...
but then stopped. She listened to cries of Fiona,
and suddenly felt guilty. She looked Fiona in the
eyes. Aki became impatient. &quot;Tifa! Come on! Do It!&quot;
She just stood there, doing nothing.
&quot;(sniff) Please...Don&#39;t take my virginity....I&#39;m
saving it for someone special (sniff)....please
....let me be...(sniff).&quot;

A tear formed in Tifa&#39;s eye. Fiona&#39;s plea induced
some of Tifa&#39;s memories......

---

(&quot;........help me Tifa.....They&#39;re gonna rape me....&quot;)
(&quot;....where were you Tifa?! They didn&#39;t just take
her virginity, they took her life! You stupid bitch!&quot;)

&quot;(...........your so beautiful Tifa.......hee! hee!
don&#39;t struggle, you can&#39;t escape from my binds......
You say your not lesbian? I don&#39;t believe you.......
I&#39;ll prove that your one of us, I&#39;ll take your virginity,
and you&#39;ll enjoy it.....)&quot;

(&quot;I love him, I want to be with  him, I... I... I want
him to be my first.......Please untie me.......
OWWWWWW! You bitch! I wanted Cloud to be my first!!!
........I thought you were my friend... I guess I was
wrong...story of my life...........I love you Tifa.)&quot;

---

Tifa woke up from her daze, she had just remembered Aeris.
She quickly pulled her fingers out of Fiona.
&quot;I.....I......I can&#39;t do this.&quot; Aki looked concerned,
Tifa was clearly upset. &quot;Tifa....what&#39;s wrong? Why
won&#39;t you do it?&quot; &quot;I can&#39;t rape her Aki!&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot;
Tifa began to cry. &quot;Be.....Because I raped Aeris!&quot;
&quot;But....I thought you love her?&quot; &quot;I do now.
But, (sniff) the day I met her, &#39;cos she wanted
Cloud. I don&#39;t know what came over me! I just,
(sniff) wanted to hurt her, so I (sniff)
raped her, and she was a virgin, so I broke her
virginity for good measure. I&#39;m so ashamed.&quot;

&quot;Wasn&#39;t that part of your plan to kill Shinra?&quot;
&quot;(sniff) You weren&#39;t there! I didn&#39;t have to do
that! I could have done it without breaking her
virginity. I should have learned my lesson long ago.
After all I went through in my life, I&#39;d sink so
low to rape someone myself, and then, I was gonna
do it again. (sniff) I&#39;m a monster, I don&#39;t deserve
Aeris, I....I....don&#39;t deserve ANYONE!(sniff)&quot;

Aki hugged Tifa as she broke down in tears.
&quot;Don&#39;t say that Tifa....your a better human being
than I could ever be.&quot; &quot;Aww, Isn&#39;t that a heart-warming
scene!&quot; Said the captain sarcastically.
That second, Aki threw a lead pipe at the captain&#39;s
head, knocking her out-cold. &quot;Bitch. You see,
your better than her, Hee! Hee! and me &#39;cos of what I
just did there!&quot;

Tifa just kept crying. &quot;(sniff) You must hate me now.&quot;
&quot;What? No I don&#39;t!&quot; &quot;You can&#39;t get the door code now,
because of me.&quot; Aki cradled Tifa&#39;s head on her
shoulder and stroked her head to calm her down.
Fiona looked at them, she felt sorry
for Tifa, she felt responsible for her sadness.
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Tifa, I can still use a code-breaker,
it&#39;ll take a long while, but....&quot; Fiona interrupts Aki.
&quot;(sigh) My code for the door is FIONA2023.&quot;

Aki was surprised. &quot;Wh...what did you just say.&quot;
&quot;The code for upstairs. FIONA2023 will open the
door for you.&quot; &quot;Oh.....Thank you Fiona. Decided
to join us?&quot; &quot;(sigh) Kinda...it&#39;s just...listening
to Tifa spill her heart there, I realised...that
I&#39;m working for a monster, Shinra. We&#39;ve been accused
of much worse than her. I deserve to be stripped naked
and bound like this....and to be raped. (sigh) I caused
her to cry. The only way I can make up for it all, is
to help you.&quot;

Tifa had calmed down. &quot;You....did this for me?&quot; Said
Tifa in a surprised tone. Fiona nodded as she hung her
head in shame. &quot;........Thank you.&quot; Fiona still hung her
head, but with a smile on her face.
&quot;You ok now, Tifa?&quot; Said Aki, holding her by the
shoulders. &quot;(sniff) Yea, I just needed to get that off
my chest.&quot; &quot;Ok then, time to get to work. Tifa, put on
Fiona&#39;s uniform, I&#39;m gonna wear the captain&#39;s clothes.&quot;

&quot;Emm...I don&#39;t get it.&quot; Said Tifa as she took off the top
layer of her clothes. &quot;We&#39;re going to pose as Fiona
and her captain. Here, wear this wig so they won&#39;t
recognise you.&quot; Aki removes a pair of wigs from a
bag she had been carrying and throws a blonde wig to
Tifa and puts a red hair wig on herself.

They put on the uniforms and wigs, and almost look like
different people. &quot;This won&#39;t work Aki.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot;
&quot;To start off with, this uniform is 2 sizes too small for
me, it&#39;s so tight!&quot; &quot;Yea, I like it on you.&quot; &quot;YOU would!
Another thing, I look like a blonde, Fiona is brunette,
YOU look like a red head, the captain is blonde!&quot;
&quot;It&#39;ll work. Yea......emm...yea, it&#39;ll work.&quot;
&quot;Your not inspiring any confidence in me Aki.&quot;

Fiona looked over at them. &quot;Don&#39;t worry girls, the top
section crew has never seen us. As long as they don&#39;t
see who you really are, they&#39;ll believe your us.&quot;
&quot;Your right, see Tifa, Shinra security only know what
WE look like. Not the ship&#39;s crew. Thanks again Fiona,
your behaving so well. Hmm...Can I do anything to
repay you, for all your help?&quot; &quot;Well....your not
gonna let me go, so....just one thing.&quot; &quot;Name it.&quot;

&quot;Whatever you have in mind for me, please....I want my
boyfriend with me.&quot; &quot;Hmm...sure. When we get you back to
Condor, I&#39;ll have him kidnapped a brought to you.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll enjoy being kidnapped by cute girls.
Thanks.&quot; &quot;Hope you don&#39;t mind us leaving you here, tied up,
till we get to Condor, you&#39;ll be safer here.&quot; &quot;(sigh) I
don&#39;t mind, it&#39;s surprisingly comfortable, and I&#39;ve
always wondered what it&#39;d be like to be strung up like
this.&quot; &quot;Hee hee....That&#39;s good. C&#39;mon Tifa let&#39;s get up
there.&quot;

They were about to leave when Aki stopped herself.
She looked over at the unconscious captain, and thought
for a second, then went over to her. &quot;We don&#39;t want her
yelling at you again Fiona, now do we?&quot; She said
as she gagged the captain with duct tape, much to
Fiona&#39;s amusement. &quot;Hee hee, thanks Aki, I think I prefer
her this way!&quot; &quot;You sit tight now, see you later.&quot;

They walk towards the emergency hatch. &quot;I like it when that
happens, she was very nice.&quot; &quot;Your seriously gonna hold them
all at Condor?&quot; &quot;I&#39;d hold you there too if I wanted to, but
I know you have to go with AVALANCHE. I need girls Aki,
and if I have to kidnap all of their loved one&#39;s and bring
them to Condor too, so be it, it&#39;s just more troops for me.&quot;
&quot;...just treat them well, ok.&quot; &quot;You know I will.&quot;

They reach the hatch. &quot;What was the code again Tifa?&quot;
&quot;FIONA2023.&quot; &quot;Ok, F...I...O...N...A...2...2(opps!)delete...0
...2...3...OK!!&quot; The door&#39;s lock clicks open.
&quot;Ok Tifa, you stay here, I&#39;ll go to the bridge. Come up after
five minutes, and claim you have a report for me. It&#39;ll really
be this Automatic Pistol. Here&#39;s another one for you, we&#39;ll
use them to kill everyone on the bridge. Hopefully Typhon and
Rufus are there.&quot; &quot;But what if Aeris is there.&quot; &quot;She won&#39;t
be, if she&#39;s that important, they&#39;ve probably got her stored
somewhere. Here I go.....wish me luck.&quot;

Tifa grabs Aki by the arm as she is about to leave. &quot;Aki...
be careful.&quot; Aki smiled at this genuine show of affection.
&quot;You know I will be. Come on! Cheer up, you&#39;ve been gloomy all
day! Smile! Hee! Hee!&quot; Tifa giggled at this response,
and let her go. She disappeared at the top of the stairwell.

Tifa waited for what seemed like an eternity. Three minutes
had passed, and she thought about going up. She couldn&#39;t
wait, she was worried about Aki. She rushed up the stairs
only to find that they led directly to the bridge.
She looked around, there were troops everywhere, all looking
at her, training their weapons at her. As she continued to
look around, she saw Rufus, Scarlet, Hojo, and then something
that horrified her. Aki&#39;s disguise had been removed. She had
been stripped naked, had her arms bound behind her back,
and was gagged with a piece cloth. A pair of soldiers held her
in place.

Aki saw Tifa come in. She struggled with her guards as she
tried to yell &quot;RUN TIFA!!&quot;, through her gag. Tifa tried to
act naturally. &quot;Emm...first officer reporting. I have an
urgent report for the captain.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s not going to work....&quot;
Said a disturbingly familiar voice from the crowd of soldiers.
Typhon emerges from the crowd. &quot;...Tifa Lockheart.&quot;
Tifa was shocked that she had been found out. Typhon knew
exactly who she was, she had to act now.

&quot;I&#39;m not &#39;Tifa Lockheart&#39;, whoever she is. My name&#39;s Fiona,
and I&#39;ve a report to deliver.&quot; She reaches her hands behind her
back. She had kept both the handguns that Aki gave her, on the
inside of her panties, lying on the top of her ass cheeks,
and was now reaching for them. &quot;Soldier, hold her.&quot;
Her hands are held behind her back by a soldier.
&quot;Hey! Let me go!!&quot;

Typhon walks over to a now helpless Tifa and pulls off her
wig. &quot;You&#39;d need something better than that to fool me,
Tifa Lockheart.&quot; He reaches around Tifa&#39;s back, much to her
disgust, and pulls both handguns out of her panties.
&quot;Ahh...Wutai 9mm Automatic. A beautiful handgun, pity it&#39;s
caked in your sweat. So..you were planning to kill Rufus,
just like you killed his father.&quot;

Scarlet was suddenly engulfed by rage upon
hearing this and stormed over to Tifa,
and slapped her on the face, turning her head to the left.
It stayed that way as Scarlet talked. &quot;It was YOU?! You
killed him?! You bitch! I loved that guy! He was great in
bed!&quot; &quot;And now your fucking his son. At least your consistent.&quot;
Scarlet slapped her again, turning her head to the right.
&quot;Bitch! Commander Typhon, do the same as you did to the other
one.&quot; &quot;With pleasure.&quot;

He gets a hold of the front of Tifa&#39;s shirt, and ripped it and
her bra clean off, he then ripped off her trousers and panties
the same way, soon she was naked. &quot;Bind and gag her, then put
next to the other.&quot; She was tied up and gagged just like Aki,
and put right beside her. You could see in her eyes that Aki
was despairing, because Tifa had been captured.

Rufus wasn&#39;t watching any of this. Didn&#39;t seem to register any
interest in him. He just stood at the front of the bridge and
stared at the horizon as the dawn sun slowly emerged.
Typhon walked up to his prisoners with the handguns in both
his hands. &quot;Soldiers, hold them in place. Aki Suziaka.......
Tifa Lockheart.......I&#39;ve looked forward to executing you
two, for such a long time. Now die by your own weapons.&quot;
He aimed the pistols at their heads. If Tifa and Aki could
of held hands, they would of, as they prepared for death.
They looked at each other, one last time.

&quot;Stop Typhon, this isn&#39;t the time or place.&quot; Rufus had stopped
him, still looking out the window. &quot;What should I do with them
sir?&quot; &quot;Hold them in the security vault..&quot; &quot;Is that wise
sir? With the specimen in there?&quot; Rufus looks Typhon in the
eyes with an evil glare.
&quot;Don&#39;t ever question my orders Typhon...&quot;
&quot;Erm....y...yes sir. Men, your heard what he said, put them
into the security vault.&quot;

Tifa and Aki where herded off the bridge and down a series
of corridors to a heavy metallic door, with a small
bullet proof window on it. They were put inside and sat on a
bench, beside each other. Then their ankles were tied tight,
so couldn&#39;t move. Then they were left alone, the door to the
vault was locked. The room inside the vault was of medium
size. All the surfaces, the floor, the walls, the ceiling,
even the bench they were sitting on were made of white tiles.

The room was cold, almost as cold as a butcher&#39;s freezer room.
This made tiles of the bench unbearably cold to sit on.
The frozen air made their skin goosepimple, and their nipples
harden. Being naked in this room wasn&#39;t a good idea. They
couldn&#39;t even warm themselves with their now bound arms.
To top that off, they were stuck staring at a wall, they
couldn&#39;t even turn around to see what&#39;s in the room.

Aki tried to say &quot;I&#39;ve got an idea.&quot; through her gag.
Tifa could just about understand it. Aki then muffled,
&quot;Kiss me.&quot; Tifa kinda had an idea of what she was planning.
They moved their heads together, and began to kiss, as best
they could with gags on. Tifa closed her eyes an tried to
enjoy it. &quot;(Maybe she&#39;s trying to make me feel better.)&quot;
she thought to herself.

Seconds later, Tifa felt her gag being pulled off as Aki moved
her head away. Tifa opened her eyes in surprise. &quot;(gasp) Thanks
Aki! That thing tasted awful in my mouth!&quot; &quot;(Kiss me again.)&quot;
Muffled Aki. &quot;You want me to get yours off the same way.&quot;
Aki nodded. Tifa moved her head close to Aki, and began to kiss
her. She locked her lips around Aki&#39;s and plunged her tongue into
her mouth. Tifa managed to get a hold of the gag with her teeth,
and pulled it off, just as Aki did.

&quot;(gasp) I HATE being gagged!&quot; Exclaimed Aki. &quot;Well, I&#39;m no fan
of being tied up like this, and it&#39;s SOOO cold! Why did they
strip us naked?&quot; &quot;They wanted to remove what little pride we had
left, before they killed us.&quot; Tifa struggles with her binds.
&quot;This knot&#39;s pretty strong, c&#39;mon, sit back-to-back. Maybe we
can break it together.&quot; They sit back-to-back with their hands
together, trying to open each other&#39;s bind. &quot;I tell ya Aki,
never in my life, have I seen so much bondage in one day!&quot;

&quot;Huh! You&#39;ve never lived Tifa! For my last birthday party,
me and the girls played a game where we chased each other around
the place naked, tying each other up, and whoever was left free
at the end, could do whatever she liked to all her prisoners.
I was supposed to be the one left at the end, that day. But by
some freak chance, we were ALL tied up. Hee! Hee! We were stuck
in the bedroom for hours, before help came.&quot;
&quot;Mmmm, sounds like fun.&quot; &quot;Maybe we should do it for your birthday.
It&#39;s the 3rd of May, right?&quot; &quot;H...how did you know that?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m one of you biggest fans, remember? Hey....I think this
thing is coming loose.&quot; They manage to untie their arms.
Tifa quickly unties her legs and stands up, furiously rubbing
her frozen ass. &quot;It&#39;s so cold my ass fell asleep. Come on
honey, warm up for me, I promise I&#39;ll never sit on cold stuff
again.&quot; Aki calmly untied herself and stood up. The cold
didn&#39;t seem to bother her at all.

She looked around. The room was fairly empty, except for a few
metal, coffin-like containers with rounded glass lids.
Aki seemed to recognise these things. &quot;Ah, Stasis Pods. That
explains why it&#39;s so cold here.&quot; &quot;Huh? What&#39;d you say?&quot;
They both walk over to some of the stasis pods. &quot;This is a
stasis pod, Shinra stores fragile organic samples and weapons
parts in these. The cold keeps them sterile. Hmm, this one&#39;s
off, you can still see inside.&quot;

They look through all the pods, they were all empty. There
was only on more left in the corner of the vault.
&quot;Looks like there&#39;s something is in this one.&quot; &quot;How can you
tell Aki?&quot; &quot;The condensation on the glass lid, you can&#39;t see
in.&quot; Aki wipes off some of the condensation and looks inside.
She can see the naked torso of a woman. &quot;Hey! There&#39;s a cute
girl in here!&quot; Tifa suddenly became more interested.
&quot;What?&quot; Tifa wiped the condensation, where the woman&#39;s head
would be, and saw a very familiar face. &quot;AERIS!!!&quot;

It was Aeris in the stasis pod.  Tifa begins to frantically
wipe off the condensation. &quot;THIS is Aeris?! Oh my god she&#39;s
so cute! No wonder you love her so much!&quot; &quot;Is...is she dead?&quot;
&quot;No, she&#39;s just asleep......hey, you Ok?&quot; Tifa was crying again.
&quot;(C&#39;mon, how often can this girl cry?!) What&#39;s wrong now Tifa?&quot;
&quot;(sniff) I thought I&#39;d never see her again. (sniff) I&#39;ll get you
out of here Honeybuns.&quot; &quot;Honeybuns?&quot; &quot;(sniff) It&#39;s just a little
pet name I gave her.&quot; &quot;I still don&#39;t get it.&quot; &quot;You&#39;d have to see
her ass, it&#39;s very cute.&quot;

Tifa looks down at Aeris.
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Aeris, I&#39;ll get you out of this thing.&quot; She
starts pounding the glass with her fists. &quot;Wait Tifa! Don&#39;t
break the glass! You&#39;ll kill her. She has to be defrosted
gradually.&quot; &quot;Ok, let&#39;s defrost her.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know how. But
Christie can, she was a Shinra doctor. She used these all the
time. You&#39;ll have to wait till we take the ship, before we take
her out.&quot;

Tifa lies down on the glass of the pod. &quot;If only I could be
in there with you.&quot; &quot;Wouldn&#39;t do that for long if I were you.&quot;
Remarked Aki as she examined the vault door. Tifa suddenly
jumped up off the pod. &quot;OH GOD THAT&#39;S COLD!!!&quot; &quot;See....I told ya.
Hmm...no way out, no way to tell the girls that I&#39;ve been captured.&quot;
Tifa begins to shiver from the cold. &quot;H..h...how are we g....g...
g...gonna, take the ship, fr...from in here?&quot; &quot;We&#39;re not going to,
we&#39;re stuck till someone rescues us. My girls are good at this,
they&#39;ll figure out what happened and take on Shinra, no problem.&quot;

&quot;I....h...h...hope your right.&quot; Tifa begins to shiver violently,
she has to wrap her arms around herself, and is stuck to the
spot she&#39;s standing on. &quot;Tifa...your shivering like a leaf.
(sigh) This is why you shouldn&#39;t have lay on the pod. You&#39;ll catch
at least a cold, if your lucky.&quot; Tifa was shivering too much
to respond. &quot;Oh Tifa...&quot; Aki extends her arms out to embrace
Tifa. &quot;Come here Tifa, I&#39;ll warm you up.&quot;

Tifa slowly inches her way into Aki&#39;s embrace. Aki wraps her
arms around Tifa, and begins to rub her frozen skin, trying
to warm it. Tifa was still too cold to respond to Aki&#39;s
loving attention. She still wrapped her own arms around
herself, and rested her head on Aki&#39;s chest, cringing from
the cold. &quot;Tifa, put your arms around me. You&#39;ll warm up
better if we hug.&quot; She slowly reached her arms around
Aki&#39;s surprisingly warm back.

&quot;Y...your warm Aki.&quot; &quot;You get a resistance to cold, when your
naked as much as I am.&quot; Aki moves her hands down to Tifa&#39;s
ass, and begins to slowly massage it. Tifa blushes, she
hasn&#39;t been handled like this by Aki for a while.
Despite Aki&#39;s effort, Tifa was still too cold. Tifa
held on tight, and dug her head into Aki&#39;s chest.
Their bodies were pressed close together. They hadn&#39;t been
this close since they made love back in Condor.

Tifa was still too cold to think about Aki sexually.
Aki however, could think about Tifa that way.
She had always been attracted to Tifa, even if all she
ever saw of her before Condor was photos, and drawings.
She was beginning to be turned on by holding this
shivering, naked girl, that she loved.
Her vulva began to fill with blood, her clitoris slowly
became erect. Her juices flowed in anticipation, as her
body slowly began to get hotter.

Tifa could feel Aki&#39;s arousal. Their cunts were pressing
against each other. Tifa could feel Aki&#39;s erect clit,
rubbing off her own. She could feel her warm, blood-filled
vulva, almost heating her own. Both of their nipples were
already erect from the cold, except now Aki had another
reason, as they rubbed of each other as both the women
breathed. Tifa blushed even more when she realised what
was happening inside Aki.

She takes her head off of Aki&#39;s chest, and looks her in the
eyes. She could almost tell what Aki was thinking.
&quot;A...Aki, did I just arouse you?&quot; &quot;You can feel it too huh?
I can feel yours get hot as well.&quot; Tifa was becoming more
aroused by Aki, as she felt her heat on her own groin.
&quot;It&#39;s your heat, it&#39;s setting me off too...&quot;
Aki started to blush a little.

&quot;Tifa....you know I love you.
I&#39;ve always wanted to make love to you. That day, back in
Condor, when we did it during the orgy, was the happiest
day of my life, as well as most heartbreaking I&#39;ve ever had.
If you weren&#39;t there, I would have probably killed myself
after losing Chu. Tifa....I want to be intimate with you,
just you and me, alone, no other girls...we&#39;ll make love,
like I always dreamed. This could be our last chance to
be together, you&#39;ll be leaving with AVALANCHE, or we could
die at the hands of Shinra. So....what do you say? One
last time...for old times sake?&quot;

Tifa didn&#39;t know what to say, as she looked into Aki&#39;s
glazed eyes, she had almost brought herself to tears with
her own passionate speech. She was tempted to give herself
to Aki, but she looked over at Aeris, then back at Aki.
&quot;Aki.....I like the idea, but...I can&#39;t cheat on Aeris
again, I love her too much, and she can feel my orgasms
when they happen.....I&#39;m sorry Aki.&quot; She holds Aki even
tighter. &quot;Tifa....&quot; &quot;I&#39;m so sorry. I want to have sex with
you so much, as much as I&#39;d love to have it with Aeris.
But...I&#39;d never be able to live with myself if I betrayed
her again.&quot;

&quot;Oh Tifa, I don&#39;t deserve you. But listen...Your skin is
still way too cold. I wish it didn&#39;t have to come to this,
but...If you don&#39;t warm up soon, the cold will give you
pneumonia, or even kill you. The only way of warming you
I know of is...is to have sex, your blood with boil
with passion, just like last time. Please Tifa, do it
for the both of us! Me and Aeris, stay alive for us!
Please!&quot; She was starting to get choked with tears.

Tifa was taken back by this, and a little aroused.
Now her clit was erect, her vulva filled with
blood, and became hot. She looked Aki in the eyes
with loving eyes. Aki looked back with lorrysome eyes,
which turned to surprised ones, then loving ones.
It was almost as if they could read each other&#39;s
minds. Suddenly , much to Aki&#39;s surprise and delight,
Tifa began to kiss her, passionately.

They held each other tightly, and were now both fully
aroused. Tifa began feel the skin of Aki&#39;s back
as Aki did the same to her. She reached down and
began to gently groap Aki&#39;s ass, as she did that,
soft moans came from Aki as they kissed. Aki wanted to
return the favour, badly. But she was buzzing so much from
Tifa&#39;s touch, that she couldn&#39;t move her arms much.

Tifa started to really get into what she was doing,
she really enjoyed making love to Aki, her skin was so
soft, almost as soft as Aeris. She was a living
contradiction, a hardened warrior with a soft and
huggable body, and Tifa loved every second she spent
feeling it. She groaped every part of Aki, that she
could reach comfortably.

Aki was put into a trance of ecstasy, she was loving
this so much, and Tifa hadn&#39;t even started to finger
her. But something was wrong. Tifa began to weaken, the
cold was starting to take it&#39;s toll on her. Tifa stopped
kissing Aki, she hadn&#39;t the strength to continue,
so she started to meekly suck on Aki&#39;s right nipple.
Aki looked concerned again, she had just come out of her
trance and had noticed that Tifa was slowing down and
weakening.

&quot;Tifa stop. We&#39;re doing this for you, remember? Relax,
and let me take over.&quot; Tifa didn&#39;t reply, she just went
limp and opened herself to Aki. Aki moved her mouth to
Tifa&#39;s left breast, and began to massage her nipple
with her lips. She would have done this with the same
kind of passion for Tifa anyway, but now it was more
important than ever. Tifa had to orgasm soon, and
benefit for the heat of it, or the cold will kill
her.

She gently eased her hands into Tifa, trying to keep
an rhythm going, between her lips, and her free hand,
which was now groaping her, firmly, but gently.
She moved her body in rhythm, to help her orgasm
faster. Soon, most her hand was inside, and she
played with Tifa&#39;s clit with her free thumb.
She squeezed it, flicked and circled it with her thumb.
Tifa&#39;s clit was more aroused than it ever had been.
Aki could now feel Tifa&#39;s heart beats just by touching
it, and those beats were getting faster by the
second. It was working, soon she&#39;d cum.

It was now or never. Aki began to move her hips
back and forward, causing Tifa to do the same.
Tifa&#39;s vagina began to tighten around Aki&#39;s
fingers as the motion or her hips brought her to
the brink. Tifa bore down, and had powerful
orgasm, as steaming hot cum came out of her,
and covered most of Aki&#39;s hand. A wave of heat
passed thought Tifa&#39;s body, and she let out a small
moan, she hadn&#39;t made any noise before, she was too
weak.

Aki smiled when she felt Tifa&#39;s warmth. It worked,
or so she thought. What Aki didn&#39;t realise, was that
the orgasm had taken what was left of Tifa&#39;s strength.
Tifa collapsed, and was caught just short of the floor.
&quot;Tifa! You ok?&quot; &quot;Aki....I need to lie down.&quot;
&quot;Ok....hold on.&quot; Aki picked Tifa up and goes over to
one of the empty stasis pods. She manages to open it
and lay Tifa inside. She then got in herself, and
lay on top of Tifa, closing the pod&#39;s lid behind her.

&quot;This might keep us warm till help comes.&quot;
&quot;Aki...I&#39;ve got to tell you something.&quot; &quot;Yea...what?&quot;
&quot;I really thought we were gonna die back there, on
the bridge.&quot; &quot;I know.....so did I. I&#39;ve had close
calls, but that had to have been the closest.&quot;
&quot;I was glad you were with me, like your with me now.
I don&#39;t want to die alone......I love you Aki.&quot;
&quot;Hee hee, Tifa I.....Tifa?&quot;

Tifa&#39;s internal organs had been frost-bitten.
The orgasm had taken the energy she needed to heal.
She closed her eyes, and slowly began to drift away.
Aki could feel Tifa&#39;s heartbeat grow slower, and
weaker. &quot;Tifa? Tifa NO! Don&#39;t go! (sniff) Tifa!&quot;
Aki tried pounding on Tifa&#39;s chest to get her heart
going better, but it was no use. She was just too
weak. Aki felt Tifa&#39;s body grow cold, and then....
her heart stopped. &quot;Tifa? TIFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!&quot;
Tifa was dead.

-----------------------

White light, a vision. Just like that vision she
had with Aeris, back at Condor. Tifa felt like
she was falling, forever. All the time, she was
unconscious. She fell, until she was caught,
by a pair of soft, female arms.
It was Aeris, she was naked here, as always,
and so was Tifa. She looked down at Tifa,
and somehow she knew what had happened.
A tear formed in her eye as she spoke.

&quot;(Tifa.....you can&#39;t die. I need you. I love you.)&quot;
She looked up, then back down to Tifa.
&quot;(It&#39;s not your time yet. You must meet you destiny.
You don&#39;t know how important you are yet.)&quot;
She gently kissed Tifa, then felt her vulva.
It glowed a little as she moved her hand up and
down. &quot;(Time to go back. I&#39;ll see you soon.)&quot;

Tifa began to rise. Aeris watched her as rose
higher and higher. She smiled. &quot;(Don&#39;t frighten
me like that again Tifa. Next time, I won&#39;t
be able to catch you....)&quot;

Tifa rose, back to where she came from.

------------------------

Tifa slowly opened her eyes. She didn&#39;t know
what had happened. She knew she had died, but was
confused, she was clearly alive now.
That passed when she noticed Aki, who was
slumped over her body. She was waterlogged
with tears, and was still crying. Each sob
brought a series of convulsions which gently
shook both their bodies. She was too grief
stricken to notice that Tifa had opened her
eyes.

Tifa was touched by this. Never had anyone
cried for her like that, of course she&#39;s
never died before, so this was new to her.
Aki stopped crying, she noticed that Tifa&#39;s
heart was pounding, and her body had returned
to normal heat levels, she was warmer than
Aki now. She lifted her head and looked at
Tifa&#39;s face with bloodshot eyes, and
was engulfed with joy to see it smiling
back at her.

She wanted to express it, but the words were
hard to form, so she just splurted out
whatever came to her. &quot;TIFA! I....Tifa..
you.....oh Tifa....it&#39;s, it&#39;s good...&quot;
She was stopped by Tifa&#39;s lips as he she
began to kiss her. Tifa wrapped her arms
around Aki and held her tight. They didn&#39;t
have anything to say to each other,
they didn&#39;t have to. Tifa had to say one
thing though.

&quot;Thank you Aki, you were there for me,
when I died.&quot; &quot;What happened? W..why did you
come back to life?&quot; Tifa thought hard,
and felt something weird inside of her.
&quot;I....don&#39;t...know. You must had done something.
You saved my life Aki!! I&#39;m gonna thank you the
only way I know how!&quot; Tifa began to make love
to Aki again. She was kissing her, groaping
her ass, and of coarse fingering her vagina
with as much passion as Aki showed her.

Aki accepted Tifa&#39;s love making happily,
but something in the back of her mind confused
her. When Tifa died, Aki tried to restart her
heart and failed. She then fell in a slump
of bitter tears over Tifa, till she woke,
the best part of 10 minutes later. There was
nothing she could have done to save her.

Tifa was starting to get into what she was doing,
as Aki began to breath heavily. She literally
rubbed Aki off her. She got hold of Aki&#39;s
ass with both hands, and moved Aki up and down,
up and down, they would kiss whenever their mouths
met. Both of them began to get hotter as they felt
the sensation of their ripe breasts bouncing off
each other, their bushes rustling as they rubbed,
and their clits hitting off each other in each
thrust of Aki&#39;s body. Tifa started moving her
faster and faster.

&quot;Oh Tifa.......mmm...mmm..mmm..mmm..mmm..mmm..mmm
..mmm..MM...MMmmmmmmmmmMMMMMmmmmmMMMMM, ahahahahah
ahahahahAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot;
Aki came. Her hot juices covered Tifa&#39;s vulva,
causing her to discreetly cum herself. They
collapsed on each other, exhausted.

----------------------

Down below in the bottom section. Two of Aki&#39;s
girls were kissing and holding each other,
near the emergency hatch, which leads to the
top section. One girl was taller than the other,
and was pressing her lover against the wall as
she kissed her.

The shorter girl had been stripped naked, and the
taller was wearing the uniform she had stolen from
a crew member, with the shirt open, exposing
her breasts to her lover.  The taller reached down
to her lover&#39;s cunt and began to play with her
clit. &quot;No wait Linda...we shouldn&#39;t be doing this.&quot;
Said the shorted girl. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Priss. No one
knows we&#39;re here.&quot; Replied Linda. &quot;But....you
heard what Uni said...&quot; &quot;And who&#39;s going to tell
her about what we&#39;re doing Priss?&quot;
&quot;I...I suppose your right.&quot;

They start kissing again, only to be interrupted
by the sound of troops coming down from
the top section to the emergency hatch.
&quot;Shit! The troops are coming down! Priss,
get back to the cargo bay, I&#39;ll hold them off.&quot;
Linda picks up her rifle. &quot;I can&#39;t leave you
here Linda!&quot; &quot;Just GO!!&quot; Priss hesitated for a second,
looked Linda in the eyes, then ran down the
corridor.

She ran as fast a she could. Seconds later she heard
machine gun fire and a bloodcurdling scream.
It was obvious to her that Linda had been shot dead.
Priss had no time to stop and cry, soon they&#39;d be after
her. She ran leaving a trail of tears behind.
She reached the cargo bay, and was noticed by everyone
as she barged her way in. Uni was in charge, and
stormed over to Priss when she noticed that she was
naked. &quot;Priss?! I thought I told you! No sex till
we get back to Condor! Where&#39;s Linda, where is she
hiding?&quot;

Priss responded, choked in her own tears.
&quot;She dead! Shinra troops....coming down here!!&quot;
&quot;What?! Girls! This is it, arm yourselves!
Follow me!&quot; They march up the corridor,
only to come across the Shinra troopers.
They take shelter in various cabins as they avoid
the Shinra gunfire.

They fire back, but the Shinra armour made it hard
to kill many of them. Cloud arrives at the battle.
&quot;Hey Uni? What&#39;s happening here?&quot; &quot;Cloud, they&#39;ve
got some hard armour, it&#39;s difficult to get kills.&quot;
&quot;Have you heard anything of Tifa yet?&quot;
&quot;Emm...No, they must have been taken. Listen,
your friend with the Gunarm, do you know where he
is? He could break though this.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ll go find him.&quot;

Cloud searched the decks, and came to a bathroom
entrance, he could hear clicking noises form inside.
He goes in, to find a long room, with a row of
toilets along one of the walls. Barrett was sitting
on one of the toilets, loading his gunarm with very
large bullets.

&quot;Hey Barrett, Are those explosive rounds?&quot;
&quot;32 Centimetre, Full.......Metal.......Jacket&quot;
&quot;Listen Barrett, we gotta get moving now, or we&#39;ll
be in a world of shit.&quot;
&quot;I already am, in a World of Shit!&quot;
Barrett starts breathing really weird, stands
up, and stares at Cloud. Just then a Shinra soldier
bursts through the door.

&quot;Alright you two, hold it right there!&quot;
&quot;Shit!&quot; Exclaimed Cloud.
&quot;You with the gunarm! Remove your ammo.&quot;
Barrett just stared at him, with that weird
breathing. &quot;I said DROP YOU AMMO!!&quot;
The soldier starts to get pissed off with Barrett&#39;s
weird breathing.
&quot;What&#39;s you major malfunction numbnuts?!!! Didn&#39;t
mommy and daddy give you enough attention when you
were a child?!!!&quot; Barrett blows the soldier to pieces
with a blast form his gunarm.

He stares at Cloud with an evil glare in his eye.
&quot;Hey Barrett, take it easy man.&quot;
&quot;DIE SHINRA KID FUCKERS!!!!!!!!!&quot;
He charges out of the bathroom and down the corridor.

Uni was still fighting with Shinra troops when she
heard yelling behind her. &quot;What the hell is that?&quot;
Barrett come screaming past them, firing explosive
rounds at the Shinra front line. The troops were
blow to pieces in his wake.
&quot;Alright Barrett......C&#39;mon Girls! Charge!!!!!!!!&quot;
They all follow behind him.

-----------------

&quot;Commander Typhon sir!&quot; &quot;Yes Major Robin? What is it?&quot;
&quot;Sir! AVALANCHE troops have engaged our own, but have taken
them out, they&#39;re heading right here, to section stairwell.&quot;
&quot;Ok, you and some other troops follow me to Engineering,
all other troops, protect the president at all costs!&quot;
&quot;Sir? Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense just to engage
AVALANCHE en mass and take them out in one massive blow?&quot;
&quot;Major, this is called tactics, it&#39;s what good commanders
do to win battles. I have a plan.&quot;
&quot;(Just like your other &#39;great plan&#39;)&quot; &quot;What was that?&quot;
&quot;Oh...nothing sir!&quot;

Typhon leaves just before Barrett arrives to blow the
stairwell troops to pieces. He was about to go upstairs
when Uni stopped him. &quot;Stop Barrett, if you go up there
blasting you&#39;ll kill Aki and Tifa. You stay here
and guard the bottom section.&quot;
&quot;YES.......KILL.....KILL......SHIN....RA!!!&quot;
&quot;Erm....Yea, that&#39;s right.&quot;

They go up the stairs. &quot;Christine.....we&#39;ll hold off the
troops, you find Aki and Tifa, they&#39;re probably in a
security vault.&quot; &quot;Sure thing Uni!&quot; She goes off in search of
a vault, and soon enough, she finds one.
&quot;Hmm, this will require all my skill to unlock.&quot;
She pushed on the vault door to find it was already unlocked
as it opened. &quot;Hey! That was easy!.....Too easy, this
shouldn&#39;t be open, and where are the guards?&quot;
She shrugged this off and went inside to find many stasis
pods. She noticed the one in the corner with Aeris inside.

&quot;This looks like the girl we&#39;re after....mmm, cute.&quot;
Then she notices a pod in the middle, thick with condensation.
She goes over to it and wipes some of it off, only to see
Tifa and Aki, holding and kissing each other. She opens the
lid to see that they&#39;re both naked.
&quot;AKI?! You told us we couldn&#39;t be with Tifa, and now this?!
It&#39;s not fair!&quot; Both Tifa and Aki slowly get out of the pod.
&quot;Thanks for coming to get us Christine.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s nothing Aki, where are your clothes, we have to go now.&quot;
&quot;They&#39;re gone, we were given a Strip Execution.&quot;
&quot;Oh, I hate those, they&#39;re so embarrassing. The troops spend more
time looking at your bits than trying to kill you.&quot;

&quot;Listen, you worked with these pods before, do you think you
can defrost Aeris, over there?&quot; &quot;Should be no problem,
it&#39;ll take about an hour...&quot; &quot;Will she be ok then?&quot;
Interrupted Tifa. &quot;....yea, but it&#39;ll be a few days before she
wakes up.&quot; &quot;Did you bring us any weapons Christine?&quot;
&quot;Yea Aki, your sawn-off shotgun and Tifa&#39;s gloves.&quot;
She hands the weapons over to them.
&quot;Ok, you stay here and defrost Aeris, and get some girls
to stay here and guard her.&quot;

Aki takes Tifa by the arm and leads her out of the vault.
&quot;Wait Aki!! I want to stay with Aeris!&quot; She reefs her arm
away from Aki. &quot;Tifa...she&#39;ll be ok. We should go and get
control of the ship now.&quot; Just then some girls come down the
corridor. &quot;How&#39;s the battle going girls?&quot; &quot;Great Aki!
We&#39;ve got them on the run, they&#39;re panicking!&quot;
&quot;Do you know where Typhon is?&quot;
&quot;Last I heard, he was spotted near the engine room.&quot;
&quot;Engine Room?! Come on Tifa there isn&#39;t much time!&quot;

They run down the stairwell to the bottom section,
and past Barrett. &quot;Huh? Tifa and Aki, running naked?
I&#39;ve started to fucking lose it!&quot; They run through
the cargo bay and towards the engine room.
&quot;What do you think he&#39;s doing in the engine room?&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t know Tifa, but you can bet it&#39;ll be bad.&quot;

They run into the room to find 3 girls, dead on the
floor. Typhon was alone at the control panel.
&quot;TYPHON!!&quot; Yelled Aki. He looked over his should and
smirked, then returned his gaze to the controls.
&quot;It&#39;s about time you two arrived, in the style
suitable for you. Naked and without any sense of shame.&quot;
Aki pumps her rifle, so that Typhon could hear the clicking
noise.

&quot;Oh please Suziaka, that&#39;s pointless. Especially when I
sink this ship with all you rebels aboard.&quot;
&quot;Get ready to die Typhon, your killing spree ends here.&quot;
&quot;Oh really?&quot; Typhon draws a hand gun and points it at
a corner of the room. &quot;Look....&quot;
They look over to the corner, only to see that Cara had
been tied to a poll and gagged.

&quot;(No, not Cara)&quot; &quot;It turns out that this little defector
is quite fond of you Suziaka, it also turns out that you
feel the same way. And if you don&#39;t do exactly as I say,
she&#39;s dead.&quot; They didn&#39;t know what to do. Then Aki noticed
something, Typhon was using her Wutai 9mm gun.
&quot;You like using my gun Typhon?&quot; &quot;How ironic. Me using
your own gun to kill your troops.&quot;

&quot;You should have kept a few troops here, maybe even that
level-headed sidekick of yours, that gun is empty!&quot;
&quot;Nonsense, I always reload!&quot; &quot;Not with that gun, it only
takes Wutai ammo, and they don&#39;t make it anymore, I have
to make my own bullets for it!&quot;
A trickle of sweat went down Typhon&#39;s brow.

Aki took aim with her shotgun. &quot;I&#39;ve waited so long for
this Typhon.&quot; Tifa was jumping around excited.
&quot;Go Aki! Kill him! Hee! Hee!&quot; Aki was about to fire when
Typhon jumped into an open hatch, into the engine core.
&quot;The crazy bastard!&quot; &quot;Come on Tifa! After him.&quot;

They found themselves on a walkway suspended over a boiling
pit of some kind of liquid. &quot;Careful Aki, that stuff is
liquid mako!&quot; &quot;Sure thing. Look! There he is!&quot;
Typhon was trying to make his way across the small
platform to an open hatch on the other side of the core.
He pulled a radio from his pocket.
&quot;Robin! I could use some help about now, the plan didn&#39;t
work!&quot; &quot;SIR YES SIR! ON MY WAY!&quot;

Typhon had only a few more feet till he reached the
escape hatch, and then it happened. Typhon could
see a Turk at the hatch, it was Elena. She smiled
and winked at him, before closing and sealing the
hatch.

&quot;NOOOOO!&quot; He turned around to face Tifa and Aki,
for the first time, he looked frightened.
Robin arrived at the hatch just in time to
look through it&#39;s window, and see Aki take aim
with her shotgun.
&quot;Sir no! I&#39;ll get you out!&quot; He struggles to
open the door, but in vain.

Aki prepares to fire. &quot;This is for all the girls
you&#39;ve murdered.&quot; She shoots him in the torso.
&quot;This is for all the rape.&quot; She shoots his
penis clean off. &quot;This is for Chu.&quot; She shoots
him in the heart. &quot;And this.....this is
for murdering my parents!&quot; She shoots him in the
head, shattering his skull.
She then kicks his body into the mako.

&quot;Rest in pieces....&quot; Aki goes back to free Cara.
Tifa was shocked at Aki&#39;s vicious attack,
if she didn&#39;t hate Typhon as much her, she might
have ben sickened by that, but she forgot about it,
and went to help Aki with Cara.
She was mostly happy that Typhon was dead.

&quot;NOOOOOOOO!&quot; Robin banged his fists against the
hatch in anger. Then he heard a message over his
radio. &quot;ALL TROOPS.....ABANDON SHIP, ABANDON SHIP!
PROCEED TO ESCAPE BOAT....ALL PERSONNEL NOT ABOARD
WILL BE LEFT BEHIND......ALL TROOPS, ABANDON SHIP!&quot;
&quot;Damn it!! Aki Suziaka....Tifa Lockheart, I&#39;ll see
that you pay for this!&quot; He runs off.

The Shinra troops fell back to an large escape boat.
They had been outclassed by AVALANCHE, and were
now out numbered by them.
The escape boat cast off from the main ship.
All of the main Shinra command had made it off.
Heidegger turns to Robin.
&quot;So.....where&#39;s Typhon? Don&#39;t tell me that pathetic
old fool let a band of little girls kill him?&quot;
Robin refused to look at him. &quot;Ha! Thought so!&quot;

The Turks were talking among themselves.
&quot;(Elena, was mission successful?)&quot;
&quot;(You can see for yourself, Typhon&#39;s gone.
Be sure to thank whoever unlocked the vault
holding Lockheart.)&quot; &quot;(At once, Elena.)&quot;

Scarlet was with Rufus at the bow of the
boat. He seemed emotionless as he looked at
the morning sun. &quot;Rufus? What&#39;s wrong?
Are you sad, because you lost that girl
with the mako power?&quot;
&quot;She can be recaptured. But now......
now there is another.......&quot;

-------------------

The rebels revelled in their latest victory.
They had beaten Shinra yet again. The price
was high, but the rewards were priceless.
Tifa had been reunited with Aeris.
AVALANCHE had stolen the pride of Shinra,
the flagship Highwind, and made it their
own. The Midnight Streakers had gained
the pride of the Shinra Navy, the Avatar,
a split level vessel.
As well as 40 new girls to add their
weakened ranks.
And of coarse, Commander Lynx Typhon
was finally dead.

Now they could take the war to Shinra.

--

It was evening when they reached the
shores of the Western Continent.
They dropped off the broken frame of the
Highwind on a beach in the outskirts of
Costa Del Sol. Cloud, Barrett and Red
had were in a rowboat, with Aeris in a
stretcher. Tifa was getting ready to leave
with them.

Aki, and all the girls were there to see her
off. Beside Aki was Cara. Cara was still naked,
and her arms were still bound, but she didn&#39;t
seem to mind. Aki held her tightly as she spoke.
&quot;Tifa, we own so much to you and AVALANCHE.
We&#39;d love you to stay, but know you will not.
We all love you as if you were the girlfriend
and lover of all Midnight Streakers, both living
and dead. Please, come see us again.&quot;

&quot;No need to get all poetic on me Aki! I&#39;ll be
back, I want to see how you do with your new
girlfriend, Cara.&quot; &quot;Believe it or not,
she&#39;s my first girlfriend!&quot;
&quot;I believe it!&quot; Aki looks at Aeris, then back
at Tifa. &quot;I can&#39;t compete with her, I never could,
there&#39;s something between you, something I can&#39;t
explain. You take of each other, and know,
I&#39;ll always love you.&quot;

Tifa went to Aki, held her then gave her a true
kiss of love, before she boarded the rowboat.
&quot;I&#39;ll see you again, and love all of you.&quot;
They were lowered to the water.
Tifa looked down at the love of her life.
Her heart filled with happiness, and despair.
She loved this girl, but she felt she didn&#39;t deserve
her. As her path split form Aki&#39;s she realised
how alone she really was.

A Reunion of Vengeance, only sorrow could come from
these......but maybe, there was still hope....
