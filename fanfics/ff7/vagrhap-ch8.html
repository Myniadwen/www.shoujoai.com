<h1>Vagrants Rhapsody (part 8 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/pnkpanther9.html">PnkPanther9</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff7/vagrhap-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>The line to get onto a lift to Gold Saucer was relatively short, 
considering it was the middle of the week. Tifa and Yuffie only had to 
stand in line for fifteen minutes. Nevertheless, the backpack strap 
began to cut into Tifa&#39;s shoulder, and so she was happy when she and 
Yuffie boarded the lift. Sitting down at one of the seats, the fighter 
let out a sigh of relief.

Yuffie sat next to her, grinning ecstatically. &quot;It&#39;s been ages since 
I&#39;ve been to Gold Saucer! I wonder how the new attractions are gonna 
be?&quot;

Tifa leaned back in her seat, deciding now would be a good time to try 
and get some last minute rest. Last night left her feeling so 
exhausted...

&quot;Tifa?&quot;

The woman stirred, opening her eyes slightly. &quot;Hmm?&quot;

Yuffie was giving the woman a shrewd look. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me yer tired! 
It&#39;s still morning!

Tifa yawned. &quot;S-sorry, Yuffie.&quot; the woman said sleepily. &quot;I&#39;ll try and 
stay awake.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t be tired! I wanna compete in the new Battle Arena with you 
today!&quot;

The fighter blinked, a frown coming to her face. &quot;Huh? But...I thought 
you could only go in one at a time!&quot;

Yuffie shook her head. &quot;They&#39;ve built a new one next to the old one. 
People go in teams because they&#39;ve got stronger monsters. I hear they&#39;ve 
even got better prizes there!&quot; the girl&#39;s eyes began to shine as she 
said this, and Tifa gave her a rueful smile.


&quot;Uh...sounds like fun?&quot;

&quot;Sure does.&quot; Yuffie leaned back, placing her hands behind her head as 
she reclined. &quot;There&#39;s so much to do over there now...&quot; her eyes went 
out of focus as she said this, and Tifa took it as an opportunity to 
look outside the window.

The lift jolted as it began to move, and the other passengers gave 
startled, but excited gasps, murmuring amongst themselves in glee. Tifa 
ignored them, as she became entranced with the view that was opening up 
to her, a landscape of rugged mountains and clear blue skies.

The view was beautiful, and at the same time, somewhat frightening, for 
it was so high up that the lift was now among the clouds, and the fields 
down below began to look like water with it&#39;s rolling sea of grass 
bending to the wind. Up here, it felt as if they were in some other 
realm, looking down on the world below.

Higher and higher the lift went, and soon, they were over the desert 
plains surrounding the amusement park. As they continued on, the 
passengers could see the large golden saucers out the windows, the music 
and cheers floating in through their windows.

From where Tifa was, she could see the winding chocobo track, and the 
haunting plain of the Ghost Hotel, the large dark building sitting atop 
it&#39;s infamous hill. But the woman stopped as she noticed something. &quot;Oh, 
they&#39;ve added more to it...&quot; the woman breathed to herself as she 
noticed the dark forest and large mansion near the Hotel. Where the 
Battle Arena could be seen, Tifa noticed a large dome-like structure 
built next to it. Her stomach clenched at the sight of it, and silently 
she prayed that she wouldn&#39;t have to fight along with Yuffie there...at 
least not today.

The lift rolled past the neon &#39;Welcome&#39; sign and gave a lurch as it 
pulled into the loading platform. Tifa was filled with memories of her 
first visit three years ago...but more people were there then she 
remembered. All ready, she could feel her nerves begin to grate as she 
and Yuffie stood to step off the lift.

All this noise and bustle...was this going to be as fun as Yuffie said?

&quot;Come on, Rusty!&quot; Yuffie said with a jovial smile. Tifa followed her 
closely as the young ninja led to the large entrance, the huge, yellow 
words &#39;Welcome&#39; acting as a beacon for arriving guests. But as they 
headed toward the large golden chocobo the ticket master stood in front 
of, a man in a fat chocobo suit appeared before them, jiggling and 
guffawing obnoxiously. &quot;Welcome to Gold Saucer!&quot; he boomed, his face, 
which could be seen from the chocobo&#39;s mouth, shining a ruddy red. 
Yuffie and Tifa recoiled at the sight of him.

&quot;Creep...&quot; Yuffie muttered as she maneuvered around him. Tifa began to 
follow her as she eyed the large man.

But as she passed the man&#39;s shoulder, she felt her legs knock against 
something, and in the next instant, Tifa was on the floor, startled and 
bewildered, with her legs in the air and her face in the ground. Beneath 
her legs, she could feel something wiggling.

&quot;Gerr&#39;off meh!&quot;

Pushing herself up some with her hands, Tifa looked back. The woman 
flushed red. Fumbling, she attempted to get to her feet. &quot;I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m 
sorry!&quot; she cried.

Detangling himself from her legs, a little person, who must&#39;ve barely 
reached Tifa&#39;s waist, stood to his feet. He was dressed in a furry white 
mog suit, a suspicious brown stain down the front of it. His face was 
scrunched in such a way that Tifa was reminded of a bulldog. &quot;Did Kjata 
teach you how to walk? You stupid air-headed, melon-chested, flake on 
the human race!&quot;

&quot;S&#39;cuse me munchkin, but who are you to call any one a flake?&quot;

Yuffie was standing over Tifa, her eyebrow raised. People were going 
around them now, slowing as they stared at the spectacle now taking 
place. Helping Tifa up, Yuffie muttered to the woman, &quot;Nice one, Rusty. 
We haven&#39;t even got inside yet and already you&#39;ve got another accident.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t do this on purpose.&quot; Tifa snapped, hiking her backpack strap 
more securely on her shoulder.

&quot;Hence, the word, &#39;accident&#39;.&quot; Yuffie said, still eyeing the little 
person before her.

The little midget waved his fist in the air. &quot;If I wasn&#39;t on the job I&#39;d 
teach you tramps a lesson you wouldn&#39;t forget! Like how to respect yer 
elders and how NOT to effin&#39; walk all over people. Literally!&quot; he 
shouted, hopping slightly at the last word.

&quot;What are you doing in a crowded spot like this where most people aren&#39;t 
going to see you&#39;re tiny rear-end anyhow?&quot; Yuffie said innocently, 
tilting her head to the side as she did.

The small man grew red in the face.

It was best to note, Tifa thought, that in situations where volatile 
personalities had to be handled, Yuffie should be the very last 
candidate to choose to diffuse the situation.

The girl in question turned the woman around and began to lead her away 
as the curses of the midget chased at their backs. Yuffie turned and 
shouted back over her shoulder calmly, &quot;Stay safe, Tiny!&quot;

More curses were sent their way, but as Tifa and Yuffie delved further 
into the throng of people, the din of the crowd drowned the small man 
out.

The two got into line for the ticket master. That was when Yuffie deemed 
it appropriate to burst into laughter.

Tifa sighed and tongued her cheek, the side of her face still throbbing 
some from the fall she had. She knew Yuffie would tease her about this 
as soon as the moment had passed.

As Yuffie doubled over, her fit growing more passionate, Tifa had to 
grab the girl by the shoulder and lead her forward as the line moved. 
The ninja clutched at Tifa&#39;s hand, finally looking up with tears in her 
eyes.

Tifa grit her teeth.

&quot;A midget!&quot; Yuffie gasped, as her companion gave her a disgruntled look. 
&quot;Y-You tripped over a midget in a mog suit!&quot; When they were in front of 
the ticket master, the girl was still laughing. Annoyed, Tifa nudged her 
hard. &quot;C&#39;mon, Yuffie! Show them your pass!&quot;

The ninja held up a hand as she attempted to calm herself, but one 
glance at Tifa sent her into another round. Other people behind them 
began to get impatient. &quot;Hurry up!&quot; someone cried. Rolling her eyes, the 
fighter reached into the ninja&#39;s jacket pocket, taking out the golden 
lifetime pass. &quot;Here,&quot; she said, flashing the card. The ticket master, a 
petite, harassed looking young woman with large bug-eye glasses and 
frizzy hair, gave a curt nod. &quot;Enjoy your time at Gold Saucer,&quot; she said 
dryly.

Nodding, Tifa grabbed her laughing companion by the elbow and dragged 
her away, to the happy cheers of those behind them.

As Tifa dragged Yuffie into the main hub, the ninja exclaimed, &quot;A 
midget, Tifa! Oh god...Y-You you tripped over a midget! That&#39;s 
hilarious!&quot;

&quot;So WHAT Yuffie?&quot; Tifa shouted, her resolve finally breaking. Her face 
was a deep red. &quot;Okay, so I tripped over a midget! So what? At 
least...well...At least I can ride the new roller coasters that Gold 
Saucer has without vomiting my breakfast!&quot; Tifa knew it was lame of her 
to say, even childish, but at the moment, the only thing she wanted was 
for Yuffie to stop laughing.

Yuffie began to sober, but she was still grinning. &quot;Oh please. At least 
I&#39;m not clumsy enough to trip over another human being!&quot;

Tifa stomped her foot, a trait she had unconsciously picked up from her 
companion. &quot;He was tiny! That wasn&#39;t my fault!&quot; If possible, the woman&#39;s 
face grew even redder. At this rate, if she became anymore embarrassed, 
one could mistake her for cherry.

Yuffie smirked. &quot;Neither was the chocobo biting your ear, but that 
didn&#39;t make it any less funny.&quot;

&quot;That wasn&#39;t funny at all.&quot; Tifa said huffily, now feeling foolish for 
what she had said only moments ago. Trying to behave maturely again, the 
woman straightened her back. &quot;And as I recall it was your fault that 
happened!&quot;

Yuffie smiled charmingly, &quot;You&#39;ve gotta learn to laugh at yourself, 
Tif.&quot;

Tifa wasn&#39;t having it. &quot;This coming from you?&quot; the woman snapped.

&quot;Aw, come on! Don&#39;t be so sensitive.&quot;

&quot;If you think my nearly breaking my neck was so funny, why don&#39;t you try 
riding one of those roller coasters? We can see if you can keep your 
breakfast down or not!&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s smile faltered. &quot;Hey, really, don&#39;t get so worked up!&quot;

&quot;Ride the roller coaster with me, Yuffie, or I&#39;ll take it for your being 
scared.&quot;

Yuffie blanched. She couldn&#39;t have that.

Staring at Tifa for a moment, she swallowed and said, &quot;All right...All 
right, Tifa, I&#39;ll ride a roller coaster.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; the woman said, turning.

&quot;Hold on!&quot;

Tifa stopped and looked at Yuffie with a raised eyebrow.

Yuffie&#39;s face was now a fair pink. She had been dared into a task that 
didn&#39;t agree with her at the risk of her pride. A prideful creature by 
nature, the young ninja couldn&#39;t allow Tifa to have the upper hand. 
Fidgeting on the spot, the girl opened her mouth, trying with all her 
might to say something. Anything.

Meanwhile Tifa watched her smugly.

Yuffie wasn&#39;t the only one driven by pride.

&quot;Yes, Yuffie?&quot; Tifa said, the hints of a smile beginning to show on her 
face.

Yuffie grit her teeth, her face turning even pinker. &quot;I&#39;ll ride a roller 
coaster! I will! BUT!&quot; and here she raised a pointed finger, &quot;You&#39;ve 
gotta beat me in three games in the Wonder Square! If you don&#39;t, then no 
deal!&quot;

Tifa frowned. &quot;That isn&#39;t fair! I dared you first! You can&#39;t come up 
with the rules!&quot;

&quot;So...Then you know I&#39;d kick yer rear end?&quot; Yuffie said challengingly, 
crossing her arms.

Tifa clenched her jaw. &quot;Fine. I beat you at least two out of three 
times, and then you have to ride a roller coaster with me. No more 
arguments.&quot;

Yuffie nodded, smiling grimly. &quot;Deal. And if I win-&quot; here the girl 
thought for a minute, &quot;Hmm...if I win...then you have to fight with me 
in the new Battle Arena. No arguments. We&#39;re gonna do it anyway, Tif, 
whether it&#39;s today or tomorrow. So it doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;

Tifa sighed. &quot;All right. That&#39;s fine by me then.&quot;

&quot;Now, let&#39;s check into the hotel. I wanna get this over with quick.&quot;

With that said, the two moved to the chute marked &#39;GHOST&#39;. Tifa stood in 
front of it, as if she was going to jump in, but then she hesitated. 
Yuffie stood impatiently behind her. &quot;Tifa, what is it?&quot;

Tifa shook her head, a frown on her face as she looked warily down into 
the chute. &quot;I still don&#39;t get why Dio hasn&#39;t made...I dunno...elevators, 
or more lifts, or stairs, or bridges, or something. I can&#39;t imagine all 
the complaints he must get about these things. Can you see a ninety-year 
old going down one of these?&quot; Tifa turned to Yuffie. The ninja in turn 
gave her an exasperated look. The fighter continued, looking down the 
chute again, even daring to lean forward some, &quot;These things are 
dangerous, people can break their necks this way. That&#39;s the first thing 
I thought when we first came here with the others. I wonder...has anyone 
died in these before, especially now? With so many people using them? Is 
there some kind of system at work I don&#39;t know about?&quot;

Yuffie rolled her eyes. &quot;Rusty,&quot; the ninja gave the woman a shove into 
the chute, and the fighter went in headfirst, shrieking.

&quot;...Just shut up and go all ready!&quot;

----------

She was dead.

That was one thing Tifa Lockhart was certain of.

The moment she shot back up into the dead and darkened fields of the 
graveyard, Yuffie Kisaragi was going to be nailed to a tree...by the 
ears.

Tifa screamed as she slipped and slid down the chute, feeling herself at 
times rocketing downward, and other times even shooting upward. A minute 
or two later, she was launched up into the air and landed back onto the 
cushioned ground with a slight &#39;wump&#39;. She sat dazed for a moment before 
regaining her composure enough to remember her plans for her friend.

Scrambling to her feet, the woman dropped her backpack onto the ground 
and clenched her fists, staring at the spot where she had just shot up. 
Any moment now, Yuffie was going to appear, and when that moment 
came...when that moment came...

Tifa blinked and unclenched her fists.

She suddenly realized that nailing Yuffie to a fake plastic tree was not 
only drastic, but it was liable to put the woman in prison...and really, 
how did a friendship reform after one friend slammed nails into the 
other friend&#39;s ears?

Tifa shrugged and cracked her knuckles. She supposed one good black eye 
should do the trick.

But where was Yuffie? She was sure the girl had gone just after 
her...did something happen? Did Tifa&#39;s fears of the chutes come true? 
Was Yuffie hurt? Or...(and here Tifa&#39;s imagination took flight)...had 
Yuffie been...kidnapped?

It wasn&#39;t impossible. Yuffie was a member of Avalanche, a famous face, 
and this was an amusement park in which people only had to so much as 
turn their heads before losing their family or friends in the mob of all 
the park-goers.

Tifa bit her lip.

Where was Yuffie?

It was at this thought, that a cold blast of air shot up Tifa&#39;s back and 
a voice shouted loudly, &quot;Booo!&quot;

Tifa screamed and jumped away, turning quickly and nearly falling as she 
did so. Swiping through the air blindly, the woman squealed, &quot;Get away! 
Get away!&quot;

Her hair falling into her eyes, Tifa could barely see through the 
curtain of strands. But vaguely, she could make out in the fabricated 
moonlight, a slim, familiar form.

Pulling her hair away from her face, Tifa squeaked. &quot;Y-Yuffie?&quot;

----------

&quot;Rusty! That was marvelous!&quot;

&quot;First I get hurt from tripping over a midget that was probably drunk, 
then you laugh at me for it, then you shove me unexpectedly into a 
chute, and then you scare me to death by shooting up behind me and 
screaming-!&quot;

&quot;Boo!&quot; Yuffie said, laughing. &quot;Yeah, that was great!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not getting my point!&quot; Tifa said, blushing...again.

They were in their hotel room, Yuffie sitting on the far bed and sifting 
through her bag for spare gil, and Tifa looking out the window, her arms 
crossed huffily over her chest.

&quot;Yuffie I know I said I&#39;d try and be more open but-&quot;

&quot;Tifa, the fact that I shot up behind you was pure chance! Dio 
purposefully makes it so that people come up in different places when 
others are still standing near an opening. It keeps people from knocking 
into one another.&quot;

&quot;But you shouted &#39;Boo&#39;!&quot;

Yuffie shrugged, &quot;I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d actually scare you.&quot;

Tifa placed a hand on her cheek and winced. It was still sore from her 
fall she had earlier. At the memory of her mishap with the midget, the 
fighter grit her teeth. &quot;Argh...I&#39;m like some walking disaster...I 
wonder what other &#39;accident&#39; is gonna happen to me?&quot;

&quot;Well...my pushing you into the chute wasn&#39;t an accident, if it&#39;s any 
consolation.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s no consolation whatsoever.&quot; Tifa said irately.

Yuffie rubbed her neck. &quot;Well people were waiting behind us.&quot;

&quot;A simple, &#39;hurry it up, Tif&#39; would&#39;ve sufficed.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s too quiet for me.&quot;

&quot;It isn&#39;t quiet, it&#39;s common sense. It&#39;s what normal people do.&quot;

Yuffie sighed, rolling her eyes to the ceiling. &quot;There was no way you 
would have got hurt. Those chutes are infused with gravity magic that 
allow people to go through them safely, all right?&quot;

&quot;Could&#39;ve told me that...and it still doesn&#39;t change how rude it was for 
you to just suddenly push me into the chute like that.&quot;

&quot;...Sorry, Tifa.&quot;

&quot;I hope I don&#39;t get used to hearing that.&quot; Tifa said grumpily, a soft 
frown coming over her face as she placed her hands on her hips. She 
stared out toward the newly added mansion, the flashing lights, and 
billowing smoke giving it a rather theatrical appearance.

But as Tifa took in the fa&#135;ade of the mansion, a slim pair of arms 
wrapped themselves around Tifa&#39;s waist, and the fighter stiffened for a 
moment before warily turning her head.

&quot;...Yuffie?&quot;

The ninja was peeking at Tifa over her shoulder, a light, whimsical 
light in her eyes. &quot;I&#39;m doing a crap job of keeping from pissing you 
off, aren&#39;t I?&quot; she mumbled into the woman&#39;s shoulder.

Tifa frowned deeply. &quot;Yuffie what are you doing?&quot;

Yuffie raised her head more so that she looked Tifa more in the eyes. 
&quot;What does it look like? I&#39;m hugging you until you stop being mad.&quot;

&quot;...Um.&quot; Tifa swallowed as she felt the heat rise up her neck and into 
her cheeks. &quot;You...you can let go now. I&#39;m not mad anymore.&quot;

Yuffie raised an eyebrow. &quot;Really?&quot;

Tifa nodded jerkily. &quot;Yeah. Really.&quot;

The girl gazed at the woman before, suddenly, squeezing her tighter. &quot;I 
don&#39;t believe ya, Rusty!&quot;

Tifa gasped as Yuffie squeezed her stomach. She also gasped because of 
how persistently the ninja&#39;s chest pressed into her back.

&quot;Yuffie! Hey, come on!&quot; Tifa squeaked, clasping at the ninja&#39;s arms.

&quot;How long&#39;re you gonna stay mad at me before we can have fun?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not mad anymore! Honest!&quot;

&quot;You want me to let go?&quot; Yuffie said, a mischievous smile on her face.

&quot;Please!&quot; Tifa cried frantically.

Yuffie shrugged. &quot;M&#39;kay.&quot; But, as she slipped arms away, she couldn&#39;t 
help but tickle Tifa&#39;s sides a little. The woman gave a snort of 
laughter, dancing away from the girl&#39;s hands. &quot;Hey!&quot; she cried, the 
laughter still in her voice.

Yuffie held up her hands. &quot;There. Ya still mad?&quot;

Tifa tried to fight down her smile and look surly, but try as she might, 
the only thing she could do was grin more. With a sigh of defeat, the 
woman shook her head. &quot;No, I&#39;m not mad.&quot;

Yuffie nodded, smirking. &quot;Good.&quot; Turning on her heel, the ninja began to 
walk out the room. &quot;So let&#39;s get this challenge over with. I wanna beat 
you before noon and try out that new Battle Arena.&quot;

Tifa blinked after her, a little startled at the sudden switch from 
playful affection to determined competitiveness.

With a bemused shrug, the woman followed after her.

----------

The Wonder Square reminded Tifa of sirens and horns and the blender her 
father used to use for making milkshakes. This wasn&#39;t because of the 
games or the music...

It was because of all the kids.

...All...the little...kids.

Tifa squinted her eye in annoyance as she passed a flustered mother with 
a screaming toddler in her arms. The child was kicking and screaming 
something fierce. Feeling pity for the woman, the fighter spared the 
mother one last glance over the shoulder before the insistent tug on her 
arm pulled her further onward.

Yuffie was leading her to her first choice of game. Tifa had argued as 
to why the ninja had first choice, and the girl replied simply, &quot;Because 
you dared me first.&quot;

Of course, this made no sense to Tifa, but not feeling like arguing the 
matter further, the fighter allowed herself to be led onward...to where, 
she wasn&#39;t sure.

Yuffie didn&#39;t seem to know where either, for her head snapped to and fro 
so badly that the older woman was afraid the girl&#39;s head would come 
spinning off like a top.

But Tifa couldn&#39;t blame her. The Wonder Square was like an assault on 
the senses, with so many sounds and colors to confuse the mind. It was 
hard not to be overwhelmed.

It was bigger and noisier than Tifa remembered but that was to be 
expected. After all, considering all the changes Gold Saucer had gone 
through over the years, how could Dio have not improved the famous 
Wonder Square?

They continued to move around the arcade, the screams and laughter and 
shouts of children pounding Tifa&#39;s ears. If Yuffie wasn&#39;t holding her 
arm now, the fighter would probably run out of there as fast as she 
could. There was no way to anticipate where Yuffie would dart, so the 
fighter felt very much like a rag doll being tossed about by the 
currents of youthful energy, the sea of screaming kids making it hard to 
see the floor.

After a time, Tifa finally lost her patience. &quot;Yuffie are you going to 
pick something or not?&quot;

The ninja, in answer, came to an abrupt stop, so that Tifa ran into her. 
The woman gave her a scandalized look.

&quot;This one here.&quot; The girl said, pointing to a large machine with two 
seats and steering wheels.

&quot;A...racing game?&quot; Tifa said, quirking an eyebrow at the game&#39;s title, 
&quot;Red Road III&quot;.

Yuffie nodded, taking a seat in one of the chairs. &quot;Yeah. Why, scared of 
losing?&quot;

Tifa shrugged, sitting in the other seat. &quot;I just...well. Okay. If you 
want to.&quot;

...Five or six minutes later, the fighter was grinning from ear to ear 
with a look so satisfied that Yuffie slouched in her chair. &quot;Luck. Pure 
luck. That&#39;s all. Leviathan was smiling on you then, Tif. He let you 
win.&quot; The girl said sourly.

Tifa chuckled, turning in her seat. &quot;You forget the stories the others 
told. Don&#39;t you remember? I was the one driving the truck that carried 
myself, Barret, Aeris, and Red XIII out of Shinra&#39;s grubby fat fingers 
when we escaped from Shinra HQ at the start of our journey.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t remember that...probably because I fell asleep on account of it 
was so boring!&quot; Yuffie remarked grouchily.

Tifa, rolling her eyes, punched the ninja lightly in the shoulder. &quot;Well 
I let you get first pick. Now it&#39;s my turn.&quot;

Yuffie sighed and stood to her feet.

Tifa grasped the girl&#39;s hand, so that a stream of young children 
wouldn&#39;t separate them. Leading her friend onward, the fighter looked 
around her for another possible game to play. &quot;Not that one...not that 
one...aw, shoot...&quot; Tifa bit her lip as she navigated around the 
different arcade machines.

She slowed down as she spotted a familiar machine in the other side of 
the arcade. Since it was an older game, the children passed by it as if 
it weren&#39;t there. Drawn to the fact that it was in a place few kids 
went, Tifa began to lead Yuffie towards the circular base of the &quot;3D 
Battler&quot;.

Yuffie grinned as she stepped up on one of the platforms, Tifa stepping 
onto the other. &quot;&#39;3D Battler&#39;? Wow...I haven&#39;t seen this since we last 
came here three years ago! I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s still here.&quot; Yuffie 
exclaimed.

&quot;Up for a round?&quot; Tifa said with a grin. Without waiting for the ninja, 
the fighter slipped in the required gil, and the machine hummed to life, 
the holograms of the fighters appearing in the air above the 
multicolored plane.

Yuffie smirked. &quot;So how does this go again? Punch to the head? Mid-blow? 
Low-kick? Rock, paper, scissors style, right?&quot;

Tifa nodded as she looked down at the buttons. &quot;Yes, that&#39;s right.&quot;

&quot;Hmm...so lessee...what to choose...what to choose...Hey, Tif?&quot;

Tifa looked up, &quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;How many hits to win again?&quot;

&quot;Ten, I think.&quot;

&quot;Wait, ten? You sure?&quot;

Tifa looked back to her panel. &quot;If memory serves me correctly, yeah.&quot;

&quot;But won&#39;t that take long?&quot;

Distractedly, the fighter opted for a high blow. &quot;I dunno.&quot;

Yuffie pushed something on her panel as well. &quot;Man, how dull.&quot;

Tifa&#39;s fighter went for an upper body attack, but Yuffie&#39;s fighter went 
for a mid blow. High loses to mid. Yuffie scored.

Frowning, Tifa looked back to the panel. Now she wished she hadn&#39;t 
chosen this game. There was no real strategy to it.

&quot;It isn&#39;t as I remembered.&quot; Yuffie continued, seeming not to take notice 
of her win. &quot;Do you remember it this way, Tif?&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot; Tifa spared the ninja a cursory glance. &quot;I dunno.&quot;

Yuffie made a face at her from across the multicolored plane. &quot;You 
dunno? How can you not know?&quot;

&quot;I...look, my memory isn&#39;t the best thing, Yuffie.&quot; Tifa punched a 
button. She chose a mid blow.

&quot;But I thought you played this game?&quot; Yuffie punched a button.

Tifa&#39;s fighter went for a mid blow, but Yuffie&#39;s fighter went for a low 
blow. Mid loses to lower. Yuffie won another point.

Tifa tongued her cheek.

Stupid game.

Again, Yuffie went on as if nothing happened. &quot;Tif, didn&#39;t you play this 
game?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Yuffie. I did.&quot; Tifa said somewhat curtly. She was glaring down at 
her buttons accusingly as if they were conspiring against her.

&quot;Ten hits...that takes too long. Gawd, we&#39;ll be stuck here forever.&quot;

&quot;Your being overly dramatic, Yuffie.&quot; Tifa punched in for a low blow as 
she said this. Yuffie punched a button after her.

&quot;How am I being dramatic? Four minutes have already gone by and we&#39;re 
only on our third point.&quot;

As Yuffie spoke, the fighters went to carry out their commands. Tifa&#39;s 
fighter did a low blow, but Yuffie&#39;s fighter did an upper attack to the 
head. High beats low. Yuffie scored yet another point.

Tifa slapped a hand to her forehead.

Following that round, the two went on to do three ties, Tifa finally 
scoring four points of her own, but Yuffie scoring another seven. The 
ninja had won...and she hadn&#39;t cheated. Not really anyway.

&quot;You kept distracting me.&quot; Tifa muttered. She felt duped.

Yuffie clung to her arm, leaning her head on her shoulder, and sighed 
luxuriously, &quot;You&#39;re so easy to get to, you know that, Tif? But don&#39;t 
worry. I used to beat Cloud and Cid all the time at this game. They were 
easier than you were, y&#39;know.&quot;

Tifa glowered down at the girl. &quot;So now what?&quot;

Yuffie tapped her chin as she held Tifa&#39;s arm with the other hand. 
&quot;Hrm...how&#39;s about we both choose what the next game will be?&quot;

Tifa shrugged, the sting of defeat all ready wearing off. Yuffie&#39;s 
friendly affection seemed to be potent against the older woman&#39;s 
negative emotions, however trivial or serious they were. &quot;Okay then. 
Maybe something we&#39;re both good at?&quot;

Yuffie grinned, beginning to tug Tifa in one direction. &quot;Maybe.&quot;

They delved into the thick swarm of screaming children; one last game 
needed to determine the outcome of their bet.
