<h1>Vagrants Rhapsody (part 14 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/pnkpanther9.html">PnkPanther9</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff7/vagrhap-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Like many people, Tifa Lockhart can take a moment to gain her bearings. 
Whether it means keeping her eyes from drifting back shut or imagining 
her bed infested with demon ladybugs from hell, her mind can, and often 
does, hover between reality and dreams. So when she first began to wake, 
there was nothing strange in hearing the shower running.

Nor was there anything strange about hearing someone singing.

The unearthly notes caressed her ears, bringing a lazy smile to her lips 
as she heard the voice drift from the bathroom as if carried by the 
shower steam. Opening her eyes, Tifa wondered if the voice belonged to a 
human being. After another moment of listening, she decided that it was 
not, in fact, human, but rather, a mermaid.

Thus, her sleepy mind clung to this thought, though it had no real 
evidence to support it, and the fighter wondered if the sea creature 
would mind her joining it in the shower. She couldn&#39;t imagine how it 
would find reason to protest. After all...this was a mermaid, and 
mermaids didn&#39;t have legs, so it couldn&#39;t very well leave the bathtub. 
There for, it would not stand to reason that this creature, who couldn&#39;t 
even move if it wanted to, would deny Tifa, a woman who could walk and 
who needed to shower, use of the bathroom.

At the very least, the woman needed to use the toilet.

If the mermaid couldn&#39;t take that, then it shouldn&#39;t have gotten itself 
stuck in the bathtub to begin with.

But as Tifa gazed toward the bathroom door, the door ajar just enough to 
allow a sliver of light to fall onto the cheap, mustard yellow carpet, a 
thought occurred to her.

What the hell was a mermaid doing in her motel room?

Squinted eyes slowly opening, memories of a brazen-hearted ninja 
resurfaced, and the woman lay there blinking for a moment before slowly 
sitting up.

Sighing wearily, Tifa rubbed at her right eye, wondering how it was she 
came up with things sometimes. &quot;Mermaids? Hades likes to play with my 
head...&quot; Dropping her hand, she looked back toward the bathroom, where 
Yuffie&#39;s voice continued to drift from. Tifa recognized the song she was 
singing. That ridiculous song, she couldn&#39;t remember the name to it, 
from the artist named...what was he called again?

The woman scratched her head. &quot;Guile? ...No. No, Gooly.&quot; She scrunched 
her nose. &quot;Geez, that doesn&#39;t sound right at all!&quot;

The sound of the shower cut off, and the woman jerked her head up, her 
eyes wide.

&quot;What should I do?&quot; she thought, momentary panic setting in as she heard 
the stall door slide back. &quot;Should I pretend to still be asleep?&quot; She 
twisted around and looked at her pillow as if seeking approval, but when 
the pillow gave no response, the woman slouched, feeling ridiculous. 
&quot;What am I thinking? &#39;What should I do?&#39; There&#39;s nothing to do! All I 
have to do is say-&quot;

The bathroom door pulled back all the way, letting out a rush of steam 
as Yuffie appeared in the doorframe, a towel wrapped around her body. 
Tifa stiffened, and the younger girl paused at the sight of the fighter, 
a surprised look on her face. After a moment, the ninja smiled. &quot;Geez, 
didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be awake yet, Rusty.&quot;

Tifa swallowed, her cheeks going red.

&quot;G-Good morning, Yuffie...&quot;

----------

The diner was alive with a jovial din that had Tifa staring, baffled. 
The seats were filled with bodies, large and small, old and young, 
grinning in eager anticipation of the food promised them, while others 
faces lit up with satisfaction as they enjoyed their warm meals. Softly, 
in the background, an old time favorite song was playing, the lyrics 
provoking a sense of welcome and good nature.

Vera could be seen, flitting about from table to table, tending to the 
needs of customers. When the woman spotted them, she gave them a wave 
and finished her business with the customer she was speaking with. 
Hurrying over, she smiled. &quot;Good morning, ladies! You planning on 
heading back on the road today?&quot; Vera asked, tucking a stray strand of 
hair behind her ear.

Yuffie, her face aglow, said with a grin. &quot;That&#39;s the plan!&quot;

The woman nodded, smiling in return. &quot;So where you going to next, Kid?&quot;

&quot;No idea. But there&#39;s still plenty of...&quot;

Tifa&#39;s attention wandered, the atmosphere injecting a sense of nostalgia 
in the fighter; the scents, the voices, the clatter of plates and 
silverware...it reminded her of Seventh Heaven. Of nights filled with 
humor, as well as intrigue as she, along with Barret, Jessie, Biggs, and 
Wedge, conspired against the tyrannical rule of Shinra. But memories of 
these times did not sadden her...in fact...

She smiled.

Vera clapped her hands so that Tifa&#39;s attention was once again drawn 
back to the woman. &quot;Why don&#39;t I show you ladies to your table? You&#39;re 
just in luck, we&#39;ve got one left in the back...and no it&#39;s not the 
run-down booth, Yuffie, so stop giving me that look...&quot;

The woman turned and began to lead them to the right side of the 
restaurant. When they reached the farthest booth, Vera indicated for 
them to sit, so Tifa slid into the seat facing the door, while Yuffie 
sat across from her.

Laying their menus before them, Vera asked, &quot;So what&#39;ll you girls be 
having?&quot;

Yuffie, without having to pick up her menu, said, &quot;The pancake combo, 
please!&quot;

Vera chuckled as she whipped out a notepad. &quot;Shoulda known you&#39;d ask for 
that...&quot; she said as she jotted down the ninja&#39;s order. &quot;And for a 
drink?&quot;

&quot;Orange juice&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

&quot;All right...&quot; Looking to Tifa, the woman raised her eyebrows 
expectantly. &quot;An&#39; what&#39;ll you have?&quot;

Tifa, feeling flustered, reached for the menu, giving it a quick look 
over. &quot;Um...&quot; she bit her lip. &quot;What about an Eastern omelet with a side 
of hash browns? And I&#39;ll just have some coffee, if that&#39;s all right.&quot;

Vera nodded, smiling as she jotted down the woman&#39;s order. &quot;That Eastern 
omelete&#39;s new. Mal picked it up from Yuffie.&quot;

Tifa smiled across at her friend. &quot;Really?&quot;

Yuffie scratched her head. &quot;Well, I don&#39;t remember ever telling him how 
to make anything. I just told him about the different things we ate back 
at Wutai. I guess he just played around with the different ingredients 
those dishes used. ...Is the omelet any good?&quot; Yuffie asked, turning to 
Vera.

Vera shrugged, &quot;If it were bad, I couldn&#39;t say. Not too good for 
business to be speaking ill of our own menu, if you know what I mean.&quot;

Yuffie nodded with a grin. &quot;Yeah, I guess so.&quot;

The woman tucked her notepad in her apron and took the menus back. &quot;Okay 
ladies, Mal will have your orders ready soon. I&#39;ll be back in a bit with 
your drinks.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; The two girls said simultaneously as the older woman walked 
away.

Tifa sat back, looking around the restaurant with raised eyebrows. &quot;It&#39;s 
crowded today. I&#39;m surprised there was still a table left.&quot;

Yuffie smiled as she leaned forward, propping her chin up on her fist. 
&quot;Yeah...this place is pretty popular. People don&#39;t mind the drive from 
Corel to here.&quot;

Tifa smiled quietly as she looked down at a brown spot on the table. 
Idly, she rubbed at it.

&quot;So...&quot; Yuffie began, looking up at the ceiling. &quot;What do you think we 
should do from here?&quot;

Tifa thought for a moment. &quot;Um...we could just go to Costa del Sol.&quot;

The ninja nodded leaning back again. &quot;We could. But there&#39;s a place or 
two I think we can stop at before we head there.&quot;

The older woman looked at her curiously. &quot;Where?&quot; she asked.

&quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot; The girl said, smiling cryptically.

Vera came back, setting down Yuffie&#39;s orange juice and Tifa&#39;s coffee 
mug. Other hand holding the coffee pot, the woman poured the fighter&#39;s 
coffee before nodding to them and moving to another table.

The woman frowned, pulling her mug closer to her. &quot;Yuffie, you aren&#39;t 
planning anything eccentric are you?&quot;

&quot;Eccentric?&quot; Yuffie took a sip of her orange juice. Wiping her mouth, 
she said with a small amount of exasperation, &quot;Tifa...this is a road 
trip.&quot;

&quot;When you say that, I only worry more.&quot; But the woman was grinning, her 
eyes lighting up as she saw Yuffie laugh lightly. The girl had a way of 
bringing light to anything. She took away the sting of reality, not by 
numbing, but by healing. She was thawing the ice that had kept Tifa 
locked, frozen in place, and she was dusting the dirt away from the 
fighter&#39;s sense of adventure. Fingers holding the butterfly pendant so 
that it caught the morning light, Tifa let the laughter escape her lips.

And just like that, their meals were ready.

Vera came, a grin on her face as she laid the girls meals down before 
them. &quot;Here you girls are!&quot;

Yuffie eyed her stack of pancakes with a grin. &quot;It&#39;s been too long since 
I&#39;ve had this,&quot; she said, licking her lips.

Tifa&#39;s omelet looked delicious as well, shrimp and mushroom swimming in 
the fluffy eggs, the golden hash browns steaming next to them. The 
woman&#39;s mouth watered.

The younger girl looked at her plate and leaned forward. &quot;Hey, that 
looks pretty good!&quot;

Vera winked. &quot;See? Have faith in Mal. He can be a lump sometimes, but 
other times he does pretty darn good. ...Anyways, enjoy your meals, you 
two.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Vera.&quot; Tifa said, as the woman walked away.

Picking up her fork, the fighter cut off a piece of the omelet. Taking a 
bite, she sighed in satisfaction.

Yuffie, already chewing a large piece of pancake, looked at the woman 
with a smirk. &quot;Betta tha Barett&#39;sh?&quot; she said through mouth full of 
food.

Tifa nodded vigorously, and the other girl giggled slightly.

Eating half of her omelet, the woman decided she wanted some of the hash 
browns. Reaching for the ketchup she shook it a bit before pulling back 
the cap and turning it over. She squeezed it forcefully...

...But nothing came out.

Blinking, the woman squeezed it again, this time giving the bottle a bit 
of a shake.

Yuffie watched as Tifa turned the bottle over, as if accusing it for 
conspiring against her. &quot;It&#39;s clogged.&quot; The younger girl said after 
swallowing the food in her mouth.

Tifa sighed with a frown. &quot;But it looks clear to me! Look! You can see 
down the little hole thing and everything!&quot;

&quot;Maybe you&#39;re not squeezing hard enough?&quot;

Tifa grit her teeth as she shook it again. Turning the bottle over, she 
gave it another squeeze. &quot;Come on...&quot; she muttered.

When the ketchup still refused to come out, the woman scowled angrily. 
&quot;Oh for Ifrit&#39;s sake!&quot;

The fighter shook it down violently this time, squeezing the bottle as 
hard as she could, and with sudden force, ketchup came bursting out, 
splattering all over the hash browns...and Tifa&#39;s shirt.

Blinking, the woman looked down at herself.

Yuffie bit down on her lip hard to stop herself from laughing.

----------

After Tifa went back to the motel room to change, the two girls went to 
say their goodbyes to Vera and Mal, who took a moment from their work to 
say farewell.

&quot;You take care, Kid.&quot; Mal said, rustling Yuffie&#39;s hair.

Yuffie smiled, punching the man lightly in the arm. &quot;You try not to 
drive Vera crazy, okay?&quot;

Vera smiled giving the girl a hug, &quot;Be safe, dear.&quot;

Tifa smiled as the woman turned to her next. &quot;And you,&quot; the older woman 
said, pointing at Yuffie, &quot;Make sure she doesn&#39;t get into trouble, all 
right?&quot;

Tifa nodded, laughing at Yuffie&#39;s indignant expression. &quot;I&#39;ll be sure to 
keep an eye on her.&quot;

Vera chuckled and gave Tifa a hug. As she pulled away, Mal stepped 
forward, his eye appraising. &quot;You&#39;re an okay woman by me, Lockhart. 
You&#39;re the only other person aside from Yuffie here who can beat me at a 
chugging contest. That&#39;s a rare and special thing! Make no mistake about 
it!&quot;

Yuffie rolled her eyes. &quot;Oh please, Mal.&quot;

The man laughed a deep, throaty laugh, patting Tifa on the shoulder.

&quot;I think we&#39;d better get going, Tif.&quot; Yuffie said, looking up at the 
sky. The sun was nearly overhead.

Tifa nodded, &quot;All right.&quot; She turned to look back at the Kruvics. &quot;Well, 
I guess this really is goodbye.&quot;

The two girls climbed onto Yuffie&#39;s bike, which was already loaded with 
all their things. After strapping on their helmets, Yuffie started up 
the bike. &quot;All right, we&#39;ll see you two soon!&quot; she cried.

The Kruvics waved as the girls drove away, the bike roaring loudly as 
they went.

Vera sighed a dubious smile on her face.

Mal looked at her, puzzled. &quot;What?&quot; he asked.

The woman shook her head. &quot;Nothing...it&#39;s just...&quot; she looked up at her 
husband. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen Yuffie look at anyone the way she did that 
girl. She must be something real special to her...&quot;

----------

The wind was roaring. Tifa held onto Yuffie, feeling excited about all 
the things they still had left to do together. The thoughts brought a 
smile to her lips.

Winding through the valley of the Corel region, the fighter was able to 
appreciate the long sea of rolling grass, the wind moving it about 
whimsically and to a rhythm only it understood. In the distance, the 
sight of Gold Saucer slowly began to sprout from the horizon like a 
grand castle. But as they neared, the sight revealed the surrounding 
desert, desolate and oppressive. None could enter, unless they wished to 
be devoured by quick sand. Memories of Corel Prison entered Tifa&#39;s mind 
as she squinted her eyes at the wavering dark shapes at Gold Saucer&#39;s 
base. Silently she watched them for a moment before turning her head and 
gazing instead at the oncoming road.

Several miles on, the sun was well overhead, the heat pressing down 
Tifa&#39;s head like a weight. They were fast entering the Costa del Sol 
region, famous for its hot, sunny weather and cool nights. The on ramp 
that joined the highway leading towards Costa del Sol was just ahead, 
but as they neared it, Yuffie instead continued onward, passing the on 
ramp as if it weren&#39;t even there.

Tifa turned and gazed after it, startled that the ninja didn&#39;t take the 
turn. But then she remembered that Yuffie had wanted to visit some 
places before going to Costa del Sol, so she settled back and said 
nothing.

It was when the ninja, turning down a lonely road and into a dried up 
ravine, stopped at a two-story building, the front of it showing a faded 
sign reading, &quot;Taxidermy Museum&quot; that Tifa found reason to protest.

&quot;Um...a taxidermy museum?&quot; the woman asked slowly, un-strapping her 
helmet slowly as Yuffie climbed off the bike.

Yuffie nodded, grinning as she looked up at the building, the metal roof 
rusted and the windows dusty. &quot;This eccentric enough for you?&quot; the girl 
asked brightly.

Tifa climbed off the bike, an uneasy look on her face. &quot;That building is 
filled with dead things...&quot; she said in a low, repulsed voice.

&quot;Stuffed dead things!&quot; Yuffie said, camera already out. She grabbed 
Tifa&#39;s hand, leading her forward, &quot;Come on, don&#39;t be scared, I&#39;ll be 
there with you.&quot;

And at the warm feel of Yuffie&#39;s hand on hers, the woman smiled and felt 
some of her unease disappear.

Following Yuffie into the building, the fighter was immediately greeted 
with the sight of a monstrous bird, its piercing gaze boring a hole into 
her head. A light shined over it, the glossy feathers of the bird&#39;s 
large and powerful wings giving it a menacing look as it stood, reared 
back as if aiming to lash out with it&#39;s powerful, clawed feet. Tifa 
gulped and shuffled closer to Yuffie, who was already at the counter. 
The fighter tried to ignore the strong smell in the air. The odor 
reminded her of almonds, pickled walnuts, and brand new leather.

A woman with dark hair and bold eye shadow sat behind a counter near the 
door. She looked up as they came in. &quot;Oh, hullo there!&quot; she said, 
looking pleasantly surprised. &quot;What can I do for you ladies?&quot;

Yuffie indicated down the aisle, where the large bird could be seen. 
&quot;Just want to take a look around, that&#39;s all.&quot;

The woman&#39;s smile widened. &quot;You don&#39;t say! Well it&#39;s five gil a person, 
if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;

&quot;Not a bit,&quot; the girl returned, handing the woman the money.

The woman let out a happy sigh as she took the gil. Handing Yuffie two 
brochures, she pointed down the aisle, &quot;Well, first floor is pretty much 
you&#39;re local animals and monsters, and up stairs are where are two main 
attractions are.&quot;

Yuffie nodded, &quot;All right, thank you.&quot; The girl turned to Tifa, &quot;Ready?&quot;

Tifa nodded and Yuffie took her hand as she led her toward the monster 
bird. The fighter gave a shudder as her friend stopped in front of it, 
bending over to look at the plaque in the corner of the display.

&quot;A &#39;cokatolis&#39;.&quot; Yuffie said tilting her head to one side. &quot;It&#39;s found 
around Mt. Corel...oh hey!&quot; she straightened and grinned. &quot;I remember 
these things!&quot; She frowned suddenly. &quot;They always did that weird chirp 
that made my muscles freeze. It stunk on ice.&quot;

A giggle bubbled up Tifa&#39;s throat as she recalled a memory of Yuffie 
when AVALANCHE had been traveling through Mt. Corel. Once when 
navigating the treacherous paths, they had encountered a cokatolis, and 
as luck would have it, Yuffie had been the first to be taken out of the 
battle, a comical look of outrage frozen on the girl&#39;s face, her arms at 
90-degree angles and her knees bent as if she had been aiming to jump 
away from the cokatolis&#39; attack.

The ninja in question gazed at Tifa questioningly, not understanding the 
woman&#39;s sudden outburst. Tifa simply shook her head and tried to stifle 
her laughs with a hand. &quot;It&#39;s nothing!&quot; she said between giggles.

Yuffie frowned. &quot;No fair! Come on, if it&#39;s got you laughing, I wanna 
know!&quot;

Tifa gave the girl a light push, a grin playing at her lips. &quot;Are you 
suggesting I have no sense of humor?&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot; the girl said, playfully pulling at Tifa&#39;s hand. &quot;Maybe.&quot;

Tifa stuck her tongue out. &quot;Well &#39;foo&#39; to you too.&quot;

Yuffie giggled and turned her eyes toward the next exhibit. This time, 
on display was a monster with bluish skin, a squashed head and large 
white eyes. Gripped in its dark hand was a chain, which in turn was 
connected to a large metal ball. It&#39;s barreled chest had a large diamond 
shaped mark, which on closer inspection, Tifa realized with a shudder, 
revealed the organs inside of the creature.

Yuffie leaned forward and read the plaque. &quot;This thing&#39;s a &#39;screamer&#39;. 
Found in the Nibel Mountains. ...I passed a few of these on my way to 
your place, Tif.&quot; The girl added, turning to Tifa.

Tifa squeezed the girl&#39;s hand. &quot;I remember these...I had to watch out 
for them each time I guided travelers through the mountains. ...Oh. Did 
I tell you? I used to be a guide at Nibelheim.&quot;

Yuffie straightened up and looked at the woman. Then, she squeezed her 
hand in return. &quot;No, Tif. I don&#39;t think you ever told me that.&quot;

&quot;You weren&#39;t there when me and Cloud told the story about what happened 
at Nibelheim.&quot; the woman turned to look at the screamer again. &quot;I guess 
there&#39;s still some things you don&#39;t know about.&quot;

Yuffie, watching her for a moment, pulled the woman along gently. Tifa 
allowed the girl to lead her, and when she turned her head, she was met 
with a blast of green.

At least nine or ten cactuars were displayed in the next exhibit, some 
running up the walls, others even on the glass. Tifa laughed at what was 
in the center of the exhibit, where three cactuar were stacked on top of 
each other, turned at ridiculous angles.

&quot;Wow!&quot; Yuffie exclaimed, letting go of Tifa&#39;s hand and pressing herself 
against the glass. &quot;Cactuars! I&#39;ve never seen one in real life!&quot;

Tifa smiled. &quot;That&#39;s because they&#39;re always running away.&quot;

Yuffie turned to look at her over her shoulder. &quot;You ever fight one, 
Rusty?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; The fighter shook her head, her smile turning sheepish. &quot;Like I 
said, they&#39;re always running away.&quot;

The girl chuckled, stepping back for a moment to take a picture with her 
camera. Reaching for Tifa&#39;s hand again, the girl looked around her. 
Making a face, she gave a dismissive wave. &quot;Let&#39;s skip all of this other 
stuff. I wanna look at the &#39;main attractions&#39; up stairs.&quot;

Tifa shrugged. &quot;If you want.&quot;

Together they continued walking down the aisle, passing other exhibits 
that included: desert sahagins, gagighandis, and jokers. At the last 
monster, the woman couldn&#39;t help but do a double take. A skeletal 
monster garbed in a jester costume that used magic to hover in the air, 
the woman wondered how it could possibly find place in a taxidermy 
museum.

But her silent inquiries were left there on the first floor as she and 
Yuffie ascended up the staircase to the second floor.

Here, Tifa felt the breath rush from her lungs.

To her left, behind a large pane of glass was a monstrous creature with 
scythes for feet, it&#39;s long, powerful legs bending like spiders and 
rising over it&#39;s own body. The head, an angular, and fierce-looking 
thing, was turned down so that the four small eyes placed on either side 
could gaze forward at the onlookers. Yuffie let out an exclamation of 
excitement as she rushed forward, palms pressed against the glass 
excitedly. &quot;Shiva!&quot; the girl turned to look at Tifa. &quot;Look at it, Tifa!&quot;

Tifa nodded, her eyes wide. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry, Yuffie. I&#39;m looking.&quot;

The girl stood back and snapped a shot of the monster with her camera, 
the flash playing off of the beast&#39;s exoskeleton.

The fighter moved forward, her eyes squinting to read the plaque before 
the monster. &quot;A &#39;stilva&#39;. These monsters are found on Gaea&#39;s Cliff.&quot; She 
looked up at the monster again, frowning at it. &quot;It looks like the 
materia keeper from Nibelheim...doesn&#39;t it? Only not as big...&quot;

Yuffie smiled, waving her camera. &quot;Well now we have a picture to 
remember it!&quot;

Tifa nodded, stepping back some to once again look the monster over. It 
was when, out of the corner of her eye, she saw a large red mass, that 
she turned her head and gave a surprised shout.

Curled up like a cat caught in a box much too small to contain it, an 
enormous scarlet-colored dragon glowered through the glass, its vicious 
green eyes causing the color to drain from Tifa&#39;s face. Yuffie, 
following the woman&#39;s line of vision, also let out something of a yell.

&quot;Gawd!&quot; the girl cried, walking over so that she stood in front of the 
dragon, her eyes wide with amazement. &quot;How...How do you think they 
managed to get this in here?&quot; the girl asked in a somewhat breathless 
voice as she raised her camera to take another shot.

Tifa shook her head, not even daring to come closer. &quot;No idea.&quot;

The ninja took a few steps forward, looking at the information plaque. 
&quot;It&#39;s an &#39;ark dragon&#39;...you find these in the Mythril Caves.&quot; She looked 
back toward the dragon, her face screwed up in thought. &quot;Come to think 
of it...this is a pretty small dragon, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Tifa shrugged. &quot;Well, consider where it lives.&quot;

Yuffie nodded, &quot;Yeah...&quot; her head snapped toward the woman, a frown 
suddenly appearing on her face. &quot;Hey! What&#39;re you doing all the way over 
there?&quot;

Tifa shook her head, pointing nervously at the dragon. &quot;I&#39;m not going 
anywhere near that thing!&quot;

Yuffie stared at her. &quot;But Tifa...it&#39;s dead.&quot;

The woman&#39;s cheeks flared slightly, and she crossed her arms. &quot;So?&quot; she 
asked huffily.

The ninja gave an incredulous laugh. &quot;You&#39;re scared of a stuffed 
animal?&quot;

&quot;You said monsters weren&#39;t animals!&quot;

&quot;Well...they aren&#39;t. But dead is dead, Rusty.&quot;

Tifa shook her head, crossing her arms stubbornly. &quot;I don&#39;t care, I&#39;m 
not going anywhere near it!&quot;

Yuffie bowed her head and sighed, placing her hands on her hips as a 
dubious smile spread across her lips. Looking up at Tifa, the ninja 
raised her camera and asked with a crooked smile. &quot;Seeing as how there&#39;s 
no point in asking you to take a picture in front of the thing, you 
wanna take a picture of me instead?&quot;

Tifa gazed at her, a small frown on her face. Then, with a sigh, moved 
forward, taking the camera away from the girl. &quot;All right, go. Get in 
front of it.&quot;

Yuffie, a large smile on her face, skipped over to the exhibit and stood 
to the side so that the dragon could be seen.

The woman, the corner of her lips twitching, raised the camera. 
&quot;Okay...now make a funny face!&quot;

The ninja, eyes twinkling, turned her knees inward, crossing her eyes as 
she puffed out her cheeks and pulled at her ears.

Tifa managed to take the picture before she burst into a fit of 
laughter.
