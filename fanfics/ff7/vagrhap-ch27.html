I feel so cold when I&#39;m at home
Feels like everything&#39;s starting to hit me
I lost bed ten minutes ago

Modern guilt I&#39;m staring at nothing
Modern guilt I&#39;m under lock and key
It&#39;s not what I have changed,
Turning into convention
Don&#39;t know what I&#39;ve done but I feel ashamed
Standing outside the glass room sidewalk
These people talk about impossible things
And I&#39;m falling down the conversations
Another palm beats into you

Modern guilt is all in our hands
Modern guilt won&#39;t get me to bed
Say what you will
Smoking my cigarette
Don&#39;t know what I&#39;ve done but I feel afraid&quot;

Modern Guilt

by Beck

Yuffie ducked as a shoe sailed over her head, her arms held up before 
her ready to block

Yuffie ducked as a shoe sailed over her head, her arms held up before 
her ready to block. Lenna stepped quietly to the side as a gray 
rectangular box marked, &quot;Endearing Human Qualities&quot; burst open upon 
impact of the marbled fuzzy carpet, and like broken bits of glass, dusty 
gummy bears of all sorts of colors tumbled out around her feet. The 
azure-eyed woman picked up a green bear whose squished face was covered 
in a layer of filth and lint. Her eyebrow twitched as she gazed out the 
corner of her eye at the owner.

Audrey searched wildly through her closet, her hair pulled back into a 
sloppy ponytail. Her cold hands dug through moldy shoes and lost socks, 
the dust and stench an assault on her nose as much as her nerves. 
&quot;Ifrit! Where is the bloody thing!?&quot; she shouted angrily.

Yuffie stepped forward uncertainly, her hand over her nose and mouth in 
an attempt to protect herself from any malignant agent in the air. 
&quot;Um...Audrey, what&#39;re you looking for?&quot; she asked, barely able to 
contain the tone of disgust in her voice.

The woman glared at her over her shoulder. &quot;With all due respect Madame 
Materia, I&#39;m looking for something vital to our mission. Ask me one more 
time what I&#39;m looking for and you&#39;ll find yourself munching on the sweat 
soiled, mold-ridden shoe cushion of Otter&#39;s old school boy sneakers. All 
right?&quot;

The nineteen year-old ninja threw her hands up into the air defensively 
and stepped back. &quot;This is getting ridiculous...&quot; she muttered. She 
hated standing in the young pirate&#39;s bedroom. It was the second floor 
over the gift shop, as it had been decided when Audrey turned fifteen 
that she would be in charge of the shop during the day. The room looked 
like a tornado had gone through it...twice. And there were papers all 
over the walls of wild newspaper stories and messily scribbled 
mathematical calculations that Yuffie couldn&#39;t even contemplate the need 
for. When she stepped closer to examine one of the pinned papers, she 
was able to make out the words, &quot;Jacket, stuffed dog, and bullet-proof 
vest&quot; along with some absurd numbers that seemed to stretch into the 
billions.

&quot;YES!&quot; Audrey jumped to her feet and punched the air in jubilation.

Yuffie jumped away from the paper she was looking at with a small yelp 
and stared at Audrey wildly. &quot;What is it? What did you find?&quot; she 
spluttered, shaken.

The redhead held up the object, and the ninja stared at her. &quot;A Moogle 
voice-recording pen?&quot; she deadpanned.

The pen was thick and a metallic red, with a bobbing red ball at the 
tip, and flashing sides, which lit when the user gripped the sides to 
write. Two small buttons on the top end read &quot;Play/Pause&quot; and &quot;Record.&quot; 
A printed image of a mog was on the wide clip, with pink glitter.

Lenna stepped closer to get a better look at it. &quot;Weren&#39;t those the pens 
that recorded a user&#39;s voice and supposedly translated it into moogle?&quot;

&quot;Right you are. I snagged this little darling at half price down at a 
joke shop. It is such a riot, recording insults on this thing.&quot;

Yuffie rolled her eyes, &quot;Yeah right. What a rip off.&quot; She crossed her 
arms and gazed at Audrey critically. &quot;What do we need this dumb thing 
for?&quot;

Audrey pocketed the pen into her bathrobe. &quot;Bribery. Now to find the 
person to bribe.&quot; She stepped over the mess on her floor and proceeded 
to the door, which led to the staircase going down.

&quot;What do you need to bribe for?&quot; Yuffie asked as she followed the young 
pirate.

The emerald-gazed woman raised an eyebrow as she carefully sidled 
through the cramped aisles of her family&#39;s store. &quot;Because I need 
information.&quot; she responded shortly.

&quot;Information for what?&quot;

An impatient sigh. &quot;Information like where Mack is.&quot;

Yuffie stopped just as she exited the gift shop. Audrey walked on across 
the street and glanced back when she sensed the girl didn&#39;t follow. She 
stopped with a roll of her eyes.

&quot;You don&#39;t know where Mack is!?&quot; the ninja exclaimed incredulously. 
Lenna crossed her arms stoically behind her, her azure stare piercing 
across to where Audrey stood.

Audrey&#39;s lip curled and she placed a hand on her hip. &quot;Only his most 
trusted know where he is-unfortunately since the debacle with you, I&#39;ve 
fallen out of that tight-knit group. Otter knows where he is, but he&#39;s 
not entirely inclined to speak with us, being the mindless bloodhound 
that he is. There&#39;s one man in this city who can help us and not pose 
any threat to us later. Thus the pen. Thus my haste.&quot; Audrey jerked her 
head in the direction she had originally been heading. &quot;So if you&#39;d 
please, princess.&quot;

----------

Tifa sat and stared at the haunting figure that stood vigil at the mouth 
of the alley. They had moved, seeking privacy in a dead end where they 
could deal with their captives and Henley could work quietly on his own. 
When Tifa and Baxter carried the two-stripped bodies of Otter and his 
henchmen, none of the civilians stopped to bother them. The general 
assumption, it seemed, was that the unconscious men were just victims of 
the chaos. Both she and Henley were already garbed in the stolen 
uniforms.

Tifa cleared her throat and called to Vincent as he leaned against the 
cold wall. &quot;Hey. Vincent.&quot;

The man&#39;s gaze flickered in her direction.

The brunette shivered involuntarily, noting how his eyes were so 
profound and sharp even from where he stood yards away. Beyond his tall, 
slim frame slipped sounds of simmering discontent. The commotion had 
died down. The citizens were in shock and were waiting helplessly for 
things to return back to normal.

&quot;Vincent,&quot; Tifa tried again, her gaze lowering to the ground. &quot;It&#39;s nice 
seeing you. The last you visited me it was...&quot;

&quot;Fourteen months ago.&quot; Vincent offered when the fighter&#39;s voice trailed 
away.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she said with a slow nod. &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s been that long. It&#39;s a bit 
lucky to see you here. Were you planning on taking these men on 
yourself?&quot; The man didn&#39;t answer right away. Tifa cleared her throat. &quot;I 
mean...did you mean to stop all this madness on your own?&quot;

&quot;Reeve was concerned,&quot; The man paused, then added, &quot;And I needed 
something to keep me busy.&quot;

&quot;Quite a pastime.&quot; Henley commented from his place across from Tifa. 
When he felt Vincent&#39;s gaze on him, he looked up, then paled. Hurriedly 
he looked back at his work. &quot;Not that, 
there&#39;s...y&#39;know...anything...wrong...with...&quot; he licked his lips and 
cursed as the device he held sparked and burnt his finger. &quot;Goddamn 
wire!&quot; he yelped.

Tifa looked back at Baxter who stood over the prone bodies of their 
captives, his hands on his hips, his head bowed.

&quot;We&#39;ll proceed with the plan we originally had,&quot; He said. &quot;But these two 
are our bargaining chips should anything go down.&quot; He turned and looked 
at her, his pale eyes narrowed.

&quot;Are you and Vincent going to stay and watch these two then? Maybe 
interrogate them when they wake?&quot; Tifa asked solemnly. &#39;Interrogation&#39; 
hardly ever consisted of just asking a person nicely for information.

Baxter&#39;s eyes flickered toward Vincent. The cloaked man in question 
gazed stonily back at him.

----------

Audrey had an over the shoulder look that seemed like a mile long. 
Yuffie didn&#39;t know how else to describe it. It was a small look that 
seemed so distant, but its scope was wide. It made you want to steer 
clear of its sight-as if afraid of that by entering her sniping gaze 
you&#39;d meet your untimely end. The redheaded pirate just kept doing it. 
That damn glance backward, as if suspecting Yuffie to stab her in the 
back at any moment. The fact that this constant paranoid behavior was 
coming from a woman waltzing about in a bathrobe and short shorts drove 
the ninja up the wall.

Honestly, how crazy did you have to be to walk around in such a slummy, 
tacky outfit?

Grudgingly, however, the nineteen-year-old couldn&#39;t help but admire the 
blue and green high-top sneakers that Audrey had traded her flip-flops 
for back at the house. ...She had a thing for sneakers.

&quot;Hey, just who the hell is this guy anyway?&quot; Yuffie asked 
interrogatively. She didn&#39;t know of anyone in Junon who could do the 
things Audrey had spoke of earlier.

&quot;He&#39;s special.&quot; Was the pirate-girl&#39;s terse response.

Yuffie shook her head and shared a brief look of exasperation with Lenna 
next to her. &quot;Special how?&quot; the ninja went on to ask with a roll of her 
eyes back toward her wayward companion.

Audrey stopped in her tracks and turned to smile disingenuously at the 
teenager who came to a startled halt before they ran into each other. 
&quot;Our goal, my chary friend, is to find a gifted retard by the name of 
Flubs. Flubs likes moogles. And computers. I give him the moogle pen-he 
finds Mack for us using the system he developed when he lost his 
favorite Mog plushie.&quot;

Yuffie scowled. &quot;Why is he still alive? Mack would either want to 
recruit him or have him dead, right?&quot;

Audrey tapped the side of her head as she smirked at her. &quot;Mother wants 
her baby boy all right. Mother keeps Flubs safe, and also tells Flubs 
quite ingeniously that in order to find the Mogs, he has to be stealthy 
about it. Don&#39;t want to scare off the fuzzy creatures now do we? So 
Flubs is careful whenever he searches for things now. I&#39;m lucky I even 
know he exists. Ran into him one day when looking for a bargain on 
underwear. He got confused that day when he lost his mum and wound up in 
the lingerie section of Passionate Patty&#39;s. Luckiest day of my 
life-considering the relative quality of my life...&quot;

Yuffie looked skeptical. &quot;It doesn&#39;t sound like a solid plan.&quot; she 
mused.

&quot;When it&#39;s the only plan, it&#39;s ALWAYS a solid plan,&quot; Audrey said, 
resuming her brisk walk. &quot;You&#39;re working with me after all, right? But 
first...&quot;

The road they traveled on came to a t-shaped intersection. Their dubious 
leader turned the corner and went on a few yards before stopping before 
what looked to be a universal ATM. Audrey patted the machine and gave 
Yuffie a hard look. &quot;Give me half of what you promised, or I won&#39;t take 
you to Flubs.&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s lips grew thin and her cheeks turned a light pink. &quot;Greedy 
stinkin&#39; son&#39;uva...&quot; but the ninja, despite her heated grumbling, found 
herself in front of the machine and taking the money out for Audrey 
anyway. Before she punched in her code and prepared for a finger scan 
(cards weren&#39;t entirely popular yet, despite the scanners occasional 
inaccuracy) she glared pointedly at the taller woman to back off. The 
redhead did so with a crooked smile, her hands up as she pointed looked 
somewhere else. When the machine dispensed the gil, Yuffie turned to 
Audrey with a sour look and handed it to her. &quot;So are you going to take 
me to Flubs now?&quot; she snapped.

The redhead tucked the wad of money into her short&#39;s pocket and offered 
a smile that rivaled her brother&#39;s. &quot;Certainly, Yuffie. Wouldn&#39;t want to 
keep your love waiting, now would we?&quot; She backpedaled toward the street 
and gave Lenna a critical look. &quot;All right, Zombie. Please step lively. 
Keep your onions peeled for any possible dangers as your charge is a bit 
of a twat and couldn&#39;t recognize trouble if it were a fat zit bubbling 
on the tip of her prissy nose. We&#39;re all in a steaming vat of shit now, 
ladies.&quot; Yuffie and Lenna followed the chattering green-eyed girl to the 
other side of the street where she came to the narrow separation between 
two apartment buildings. A daunting fence that had spikes at the top 
sealed off the space. She climbed the fence easily and avoided the 
dangerous tips with great circumspect. As she did so, her bathrobe&#39;s 
sleeves fell back to reveal powerful arms-an observation that made 
Yuffie do a double take. When had the pirate gained so much upper body 
strength?

When they were all over the fence, Audrey sidled carefully past the 
pipes and ducts that led into the ground. The ninja was wondering to 
herself what sort of nonsense she was going to find herself in over the 
next few hours whilst her supposed guardian was busy trying to keep an 
eye out for said nonsense. All the while, Audrey prattled on. &quot;I am now 
just as liable to having my nut blown off as the two of you-and 
personally I have no interest in dying simply because of a girl&#39;s 
lovesick sense of duty. That being said, you&#39;ll just have to trust in 
what I tell you because as much as you two cross-eyed knucks think you 
understand the game, believe me, you understand nothing.&quot; Yuffie let out 
a yelp as she touched one of the pipes unthinkingly with her hand. They 
were blazing hot. &quot;Mind your limbs. There&#39;s a reason there was a gate.&quot; 
Audrey warned belatedly, a shadow of a smile on her lips.

She came to a stop at the end of the way, which was blocked off by a 
high wall. She looked at her two companions and pointed down at the 
manhole. Knicks in the metal showed that whatever had the lid bolted 
down had been removed, no doubt illegally. &quot;This leads to the sewer 
system.&quot; She looked at Yuffie, her face blank. &quot;From there, we can enter 
the old passageways. The ones I took you through when those riots 
happened all those years ago.&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s brows pressed together at the memory.

Audrey knelt down and with her strong arms, she lifted the heavy manhole 
cover easily. Lenna looked at Yuffie. &quot;Are you going to be okay?&quot; she 
asked, aware of the girl&#39;s claustrophobia.

&quot;I did it before. I can do it again.&quot; The ninja bit out-not out of anger 
but anxiety. She looked at the pirate expectantly.

&quot;I&#39;ll go first, just to assuage some of your unsaid concerns.&quot; Audrey 
said, giving Yuffie a critical look.

Truthfully, Yuffie had been afraid that the redhead would ditch them if 
they both went first. Though she would&#39;ve liked to say otherwise, her 
reasoning came from the fact that she knew...

If she were in Audrey&#39;s shoes, that&#39;s exactly what she would&#39;ve done.

The object in Henley&#39;s hand, crafted together by the flashlight and 
radio he had acquired, looked weird. It was all on a caramel plastic 
board-little bigger than Henley&#39;s hand. A confusing array of wires 
snaked around what looked to be small glass bulbs. Henley, amid the 
tangle, had fixed in a switch in one of the lower corners. A larger wire 
protruded from the front end, its tip stripped naked to reveal the 
copper filaments inside. He kept the awkward device close to his chest, 
his back to the security camera fixed to their right just over the 
security panel and door.

Tifa hovered nervously next to him as he gazed with an excogitative look 
on his face at the digital panel that opened the heavy metal door. The 
door was where they had seen other police personnel exit, and while the 
territory beyond that was unknown, it was all they had to go with. The 
brunette&#39;s body occasionally shifted from one foot to the other as he 
studied the panel. Tifa resisted the urge to look over her shoulder too 
much. Her mind was preoccupied with the possibility of the patrolling 
group of policeman finding them.

&quot;Tifa, do me a favor.&quot; Henley said, his round freckled countenance 
turning vaguely in her direction. His eyes remained fixed on the 
troublesome obstacle before them.

&quot;What?&quot; Tifa asked, her eyes snapping onto him.

&quot;Punch this thing.&quot;

The silence that followed his request was punctuated only by the 
occasional exclamation and cough from those around them. &quot;You want me to 
what?&quot; she returned flatly.

He looked at her, his usually upbeat face soured in genuine irritation. 
&quot;Punch it, I said.&quot;

Tifa shook her head, her look disbelieving. &quot;Henley, I&#39;m not super 
woman! And how would my destroying the panel help at all?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not asking you to destroy it, I&#39;m asking you to hit it. It&#39;s the 
only way I can feed this wire beyond the interface to jinx the door 
open. A gunshot would attract attention. I have no tools to get to the 
crap inside. BUT, an offhand outburst of emotion from a frustrated young 
cop would arouse less commotion and get the job done easily.&quot; Henley 
rationalized all this quickly. Tifa didn&#39;t realize how much he could 
sound like Baxter when under duress. He continued, his mouth set in a 
somber line, &quot;Now c&#39;mon and try. Are you near your Limit? Transfer that 
force into hitting this thing.&quot;

&quot;Y&#39;know, I really don&#39;t understand why we couldn&#39;t just try and wait for 
someone to just show us the code...&quot; But Tifa knew why even without her 
companion explaining it to her. It&#39;d take too long. Everything just took 
too long. &quot;All I want is to see Yuffie all right...&quot; The woman thought 
agonizingly. She stepped closer toward the panel, her expression 
strained beneath the bill of the policeman&#39;s cap. Henley stepped aside 
to give her room, his expression letting up when he saw that she would 
give it a try.

The brunette, feeling her frustrations build up in her, took several 
deep breaths. In truth, she was close to her Limit Break...but it didn&#39;t 
feel close enough. She tried to gather up her anger, her fears-her 
effort turned her face a deep shade of red, her shoulders tensed and 
shook-but it all fell short. The power curled in her gut in a tingling 
sensation, but it didn&#39;t flow through the rest of her body. The energy 
wasn&#39;t enough to unleash her power.

She took a step back, and her eyes surreptitiously flitted up at the 
camera that was fixed over the panel.

&quot;Henley,&quot; she hissed.

The man looked at her with a confused frown.

&quot;Hit me,&quot; she hissed again, her look fierce.

Now it was he who balked at her. &quot;You want me to what-??&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m close but not there yet, okay? Just hit me in the gut or something. 
It works out better this way, believe me. At least we can put on a show 
for the camera now. The thing doesn&#39;t even have a mic so it&#39;s all in how 
we act.&quot;

Henley&#39;s face softened with understanding, but he still looked 
uncomfortable. He didn&#39;t offer any arguments however, and only 
straightened his stolen policeman&#39;s cap with a grim look. &quot;When I told 
boss that I was destined to be a performer, I never imagined something 
like this...&quot; he muttered to himself as he tucked his device into his 
pocket and began to pace back and forth. It seemed he was trying to 
muster up enough gumption to go through with it.

Tifa crossed her arms and tapped her foot impatiently-an action she had 
seen Yuffie do when impatiently waiting for something. She didn&#39;t need 
to pretend to pull it off.

Henley finally swiped furiously at his mouth, then stomped forward and 
gave Tifa a rough shove. &quot;If we&#39;re going to do it, let&#39;s make it really 
look worthwhile, huh?&quot; he smirked, out of sight of the camera, &quot;Maybe 
I&#39;ll get an award for this or something?&quot;

His push sent the brunette reeling back several steps and nearly made 
her lose her cap. Flustered and, truthfully, a little miffed, she shoved 
Henley right back-making sure to point accusingly at his face as she 
spoke to him. &quot;So long as this gets us in without trouble I don&#39;t care 
how we do it! Just get me angry and fast!&quot;

Henley blinked at her, than gave a shrug. &quot;Okay...&quot; That&#39;s when his open 
hand came around struck her hard across the cheek.

Tifa&#39;s head snapped to the right, her chin knocking into her collarbone 
as her neck muscles sent an unpleasant jolt of pain through her. Her 
cheek stung, and a little bit of spit even flew from her lips and now 
globbed part of her face. The brunette&#39;s policeman&#39;s cap spun to the 
side, and sat on her head crooked and less secure as wisps of her hair 
fell out of her bun and into her face.

The blood boiled upward, Tifa&#39;s eyes flashed-and with a stare that could 
make even make Hades cower in his lair-the woman advanced on Henley. Her 
teeth were bared as she touched a hand to her face. &quot;What in Bahamut&#39;s 
name possessed you to do that!?&quot;

Henley took a quick step back, alarmed. He held up his hands, boyish 
face now ashen. &quot;Hey...hey! You asked me to do it, toots!&quot; he said in an 
attempt to make light of the situation.

Being called &#39;toots&#39; seemed to make the woman&#39;s anger worse. &quot;I asked 
you to hit me, not insult me you dippy, prepubescent moron!&quot; Tifa 
half-screamed, pointing ecstatically at her swelling cheek.

Henley gestured gingerly at her face, sidling to the side so that he was 
in front of the panel. She was as livid as a bull seeing red, but at 
least he could steer this all in their favor. &quot;All right, Tifa. Hey, 
really, I mean-a slap technically DOES count as a hit! Strong skin to 
skin contact that results in pain seems to fit the definition rather 
well for-YIKES!!&quot; he backed up quickly, his speedy dodge managed only 
from his physical conditioning. The fighter&#39;s fist, sent in a wide left 
hook, sailed past his nose and rustled his limp hair into his eyes. His 
back pressed against the wall behind him, the panel between his 
shoulders. Henley&#39;s eyes were wide as he could see the ripples of energy 
that came off the woman before him in thick waves.

Was this really such a good idea?

&quot;T-Tifa-&quot; he stuttered, round face drawn as she pulled back again. No 
time. The woman seemed driven by her emotions now. The Limit Break was 
coming.

With an alarming speed, the brunette sent her other fist sailing forward 
toward the young soldier, her mind and heart demanding retribution. 
Dimly she recognized that she had released her Limit Break in a way that 
quickened her actions and packed a searing wallop of spiritual energy 
behind her punch. It had garnered the nickname the Beat Rush from her 
Avalanche teammates, as it came so quickly and often left her enemies 
either completely decimated or practically unconscious from the beating 
they took.

&quot;You beat &#39;em so hard it&#39;s like their soul&#39;s getting battered too!&quot; 
Barret had crowed proudly.

It was sheer anticipation that allowed Henley to move quick enough to 
dodge Tifa&#39;s fist by a mere millimeter. Instead of him, her fist sunk 
into the metal panel that they had been puzzling over for the last five 
minutes. It seemed to crumple beneath her bare fist like paper, and it 
was the energy surrounding her that kept Tifa&#39;s skin protected from the 
splitting steel and fracturing plastic. The numerical pad fell apart 
like broken teeth, and there was a weak sputter of electricity as the 
fighter retracted her fist.

Henley looked at her in nervous relief. He stepped a little to the side 
and looked at the panel with wide eyes. &quot;Way to go, lady! You really did 
a number on that-&quot;

The backside of Tifa&#39;s fist slammed into Henley&#39;s face and knocked his 
head back with a snap that sent him stumbling. When he righted himself 
his eyes were a little crossed and his mouth was open. He shook his eyes 
straight and reached a hand up to his nose to find it was bleeding. He 
looked at Tifa, confounded.

She had to fight from giving into the rest of her Limit Break, as the 
energy roared in her ears demanding to be set free. She hissed through 
bare teeth and held up a quaking finger as she fixed her companion with 
a deadly look, &quot;Next time, HIT me.&quot; she licked her lips and pointed at 
her face, &quot;It&#39;s bad enough when one woman slaps another, but when a guy 
does it, it&#39;s UNFORGIVEABLE. Got it?&quot; Tifa leaned back. Then added as an 
afterthought when she turned toward the panel. &quot;And you should think 
twice before calling a girl &#39;toots&#39;. It&#39;s really misogynistic.&quot;

Henley blinked dumbly at her, his nose still bleeding. Then he gave his 
head another shake and mumbled an apology as he went to the panel and 
peered inside. Tifa had really whomped it, but everything inside was 
still intact. He spied the circuit he needed and took out his device. 
Tifa scratched the back of her head and stepped closer to block the 
camera&#39;s view again. Did she get carried away? Was Yuffie&#39;s temper 
rubbing off on her?

Henley managed to wrap the wire inside the panel, and when he finished, 
he flicked on the switch. There was a low buzz, a puff of smoke that 
alarmed them both-then the unexpected sound of the locks disengaging. 
The metal door was sliding back.

Henley smiled in relief, and with a brief look at Tifa, disengaged his 
device went in through the door. Tifa followed him. She resisted the 
urge to look back as the door shut behind them.

The soldier led the way and the fighter followed, her gaze ducked and 
her gait stiff. This place was so cold and sparse. The halls were 
narrow-Yuffie would hate them-and the rooms they passed deeper in were 
dark and locked.

At the first available opportunity, Henley threw away the device he had 
created. Tifa stared at his back as he continued walking. &quot;Don&#39;t we need 
that?&quot; she asked, her gaze snapping back onto the trashcan where the 
device had been discarded.

Henley shrugged. &quot;Not here. We&#39;re in now. That thing won&#39;t do us much 
good, and&#39;ll probably just attract attention.&quot;

&quot;And if someone finds it?&quot;

&quot;It looks like a broken computer part. No one&#39;ll suspect anything.&quot;

Conveniently, next to what appeared to be a break room, was a map of the 
police routes. Henley stopped in front of it. A riot policeman exited 
the break room when he did so, and Tifa pulled the brim of her cap down 
as she turned away. Nervously she wondered if they had been made. The 
policeman glanced at them briefly, his black helmet raised just enough 
that his mouth was exposed, and when he passed Tifa, he smirked and 
slowed momentarily to take a sensuous bite of the banana he had just 
peeled.

The twenty-three year old glared venomously at him, his standard issue 
leather boots scuffing along the polished floor as he strutted. She 
turned and said with no small amount of disgust to her companion, &quot;Why 
do I seem to all ways run into such pigs?&quot;

Henley looked at her and grinned nervously, his nose swollen and still 
sporting dried blood around the rim of his left nostril. &quot;Just your luck 
I s&#39;pose,&quot; he said shakily. He didn&#39;t have any desire to rile her up 
again. His nose still hurt a lot. &quot;We&#39;re lucky though that Junon is 
notorious for having such a quick turnout of its police force. I doubt 
we&#39;ll run into much trouble in here so long as we don&#39;t do anything 
absurd...well...anything else absurd...that last stunt we pulled gave me 
a headache.&quot;The man turned his attention back to the map and tapped 
where they were. &quot;From what this is telling me, we&#39;re about two sectors 
away from HQ. It&#39;ll be easy getting there. The hard part&#39;ll be figuring 
out what to do once we&#39;re there.&quot;

&quot;D&#39;you think that those thugs have people in here working for them?&quot; 
Tifa said suddenly in a low voice. Her brows pressed together, creating 
a small wrinkle on her forehead. &quot;Those two we caught were dressed in 
police uniforms, and we&#39;d only seen them a little before that in 
civvies!&quot;

Henley snickered. &quot;Civvies?&quot; he echoed, looking at the woman with a 
humorous grin. He shook his head, his face returning to its solemn 
concentration. &quot;I don&#39;t know, Tifa. There are too many what-ifs. I know 
this isn&#39;t an ideal situation, but we gotta make do with what we got, 
okay?&quot; He patted her shoulder and gave her a wink. &quot;This is cake 
compared to what you went through before, huh?&quot;

Tifa followed after him silently as he continued his quick pace. &quot;But it 
wasn&#39;t fun then either.&quot; The fighter thought derisively.

----------

Audrey tugged at the heavy door, her face contorted with strain as it 
pulled back. When it was open enough for Lenna to squeeze in and push 
from the other side, the soldier did so and the door opened faster. 
Yuffie, meanwhile, watched them with a dull gaze. She didn&#39;t think she&#39;d 
find herself in such a terrible setting again-in yet another sewer. At 
this rate, she figured dryly, I&#39;ll be the world&#39;s foremost expert on 
sewers.

Her companions gazed at her when the task was done. The door they had 
opened was the door that led into the secret passageways the pirates 
used. They had been down there for ten minutes, moving briskly through 
the dark and taking many confusing turns through the labyrinth of 
tunnels. The door they found was tucked away behind a set of pipes that 
led upward. Audrey jerked her head impatiently at the ninja, her 
obnoxious voice now low and conspiratorial. &quot;Get a move on, princess. 
The sooner we&#39;re through this bee hive the better for you and me.&quot;

Yuffie grit her teeth and pushed off the pipe she had been leaning on, 
following as Audrey led the way into the dark passage. Lenna followed 
them, closing the door behind them with a low grunt.

The tunnels were even more closed in than the sewers, the ceiling 
skimming the ninja&#39;s head and forcing Audrey and Lenna to duck a little. 
Width wise, there was no elbow room. &quot;I couldn&#39;t do the chocobo dance if 
my life depended on it,&quot; the ninja thought with a bit of alarm. She 
worried about an earthquake so terrible that they would all be buried 
alive beneath the metal and concrete. She imagined a flood roaring 
towards them and drowning them like rodents. Yuffie imagined lots of 
things, and none of them made her feel better.

&quot;Breathe through the nose and out through the mouth.&quot; Lenna muttered in 
her ear.

The nineteen-year-old jumped at how close the woman was to her, and 
stopped briefly to give her a wild look before continuing forward. &quot;I 
thought I told you not to be creepy!?&quot; Yuffie snapped in a weak voice. 
She felt like her heart was going to burst the way it beat against her 
chest. It was making her nauseous.

&quot;Through the nose, and out the mouth.&quot; Lenna repeated stubbornly. &quot;Think 
about Tifa, safe. Think about being able to hold and kiss her again if 
you need to.&quot;

Yuffie was about to turn and around and snap at the woman to mind her 
own business when the image came up in her mind of feeling Tifa&#39;s soft 
body against hers. Of kissing her, and smelling that delicious vanilla 
aroma-was it from her body wash or some sort of body spray? &quot;Natural. 
It&#39;s natural.&quot; The ninja thought with a sudden goofy grin. She imagined 
what it would be like to be with Tifa again, just the two of them, away 
from all this commotion. They could relax, they could have fun, they 
could...

Yuffie swallowed the saliva that had pooled in her mouth and breathed 
deep through her nose and mouth. With a determined glare she stomped 
forward and began to push at Audrey&#39;s back. The woman&#39;s back arched when 
she tried to dance away from the ninja&#39;s touch.

&quot;Idiot! What are you doing??&quot; the redhead yelped in a panic.

Yuffie snarled back at her. &quot;Hurry the hell up you homophobe. You&#39;re 
moving way too slow!&quot;

&quot;I am not a homophobe, I just dislike being molested!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not beyond pinching your ass to make you move faster, Audrey!&quot;

&quot;You lay one soddin&#39; finger on me and I&#39;ll jam the fucking thing in your 
flamin&#39; eye.&quot;

&quot;For Ifrit&#39;s sake, move then!&quot;

Behind them, Lenna smiled.

----------

When Otter came to, it was with the feeling that knives were slicing 
into his nerves a thousand times per second. The base of his neck ached 
from the strain of his head having been fixed in such an uncomfortable 
position. When his eyes batted open and he saw the sky overhead, his 
initial thought was that he had fallen asleep on the roof of his 
apartment again.

A shadowy figure came to stand over him with both boots at either side 
of his head, and it was then that he remembered just where he was and 
what he had been doing.

The redhead moved to push himself up, but he finally realized why his 
arms had felt the way they had. He was tied up and his arms had fallen 
asleep. His back hurt from how he had been laying on his hands-and his 
hands hurt like hell for that matter. He looked down at himself groggily 
and noted the lack of clothes. With his wide grin, the man allowed his 
head to fall back against the concrete. &quot;Got cheeky, eh? Did my Johnson 
scare you, mate?&quot; he joked.

Baxter resisted the urge to take his foot and smash it in the thug&#39;s 
face. Instead, he looked back at Vincent wordlessly. The cloaked man 
pushed off the wall he leaned on and came forward slowly-the smart clop 
of his shoes on the dirty ground sounded like distant shots in the dark. 
His face was partially concealed by his collar, and behind the dark inky 
strands of hair seared a pair of violent eyes-tainted by the demons 
inside him, the anger and pain he had suffered, the agony he himself had 
caused in his time on the Planet. This lidded gaze, barely visible 
beneath his abstruse facade, withered the chaotic grin on Otter&#39;s face.

The redhead&#39;s skin blushed from the roots of his hair down his chest and 
arms a curious shade of pink-and his lips set in a long pale line when 
Vincent stopped next to his left arm.

The gunslinger knelt down and behind the shadow of his collar allowed a 
sneer to appear on his face. &quot;Cretin. Obstreperous blight on humanity&#39;s 
soul. Where is your leader?&quot; Vincent asked, his deep unnerving voice 
managing a twitch even from Baxter. Speech seemed so unnatural for the 
man somehow-despite his eloquence and velvety tones. There was something 
underneath it. A threat not only to the criminal before them...but to 
the soldier as well.

Instinctively, Baxter&#39;s hand hovered near his gun beneath his coat and 
he kept his pale gaze on Vincent.

Otter smiled nervously at him, the bravado that kept him going somehow 
deflated in the face of such natural menace. He squirmed where he lay, 
vainly attempting to ease the discomfort on his back and hands by 
redistributing his weight. When that failed, he asked shakily, &quot;Help a 
boy out, eh? Maybe after a proper bit of circulation through my body&#39;s 
branches, I can offer an accurate answer.&quot;

Vincent let out a discreet sigh and stood to his feet. He walked back to 
the wall he had been leaning on without a word or backward glance. Otter 
craned his head to see if he could follow the man&#39;s actions, but Baxter 
blocked his view. Despite himself, the redheaded man began to shake. 
&quot;S&#39;cold...&quot; he mumbled, seemingly trying to reassure himself that there 
was no other reason for his shivers.

Then came the dragging sound. Otter scowled and once again tried to 
crane his head around to see where Vincent was. A second later, the 
cloaked man came back into view-dragging behind him the half-naked body 
of Otter&#39;s partner, Herald. There were bruises all along his pale body 
and the only thing he could see were the whites of his eyes.

Vincent dropped his legs, a faint hint of disdain in his actions as he 
turned to gaze again at Otter. He lowered his collar to reveal his pale 
face, all the better to properly glare at the man. &quot;Your friend didn&#39;t 
last too long. His answers weren&#39;t nearly as &#39;accurate&#39; enough for 
someone of his position in your criminal hierarchy.&quot; He stepped closer 
to Otter, his gaze narrowing. His golden claw flexed and he tilted his 
head slightly to the side. &quot;So I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll give me the ACCURATE 
answers that someone of your esteemed position is supposed to know...&quot;

Otter swallowed hard.

----------

The ladder that led up into the street was oily and grimy. Overhead, 
through the manhole lid, the faint sounds of human activity could be 
heard like an echoing song stuck in repeat. Audrey carefully peeked up 
through one of the holes to see if the coast were clear. Satisfied that 
it was all safe, the pirate lifted the heavy cover and shoved it aside. 
The area they were emerging in was similar to the last, a quartered off 
area of air ducts, water and sewer pipes from the apartment buildings on 
either side. Ahead was a new street-which meant a new sector.

They had successfully managed to cross the tunnels without any problems. 
Secretly, the pirate had been concerned that they would run into one of 
Mack&#39;s goons-but in truth, focus was probably being held in the area 
they had recently escaped. None of the others would be able to guess 
that Yuffie and Audrey had made an uneasy alliance, and so none would 
know the ninja had left her respective sector. &quot;But in order to get to 
Mack, we&#39;ll have to get creative. Using the tunnels again would be 
suicide. We&#39;d run into one of the others for sure. No, no. We&#39;ll need 
either a stroke of luck or a bloody miracle to find a way onward from 
this point. ...But why tell Yuffie that? It&#39;d break her lovesick 
heart...&quot; Audrey concealed a smile as she hurriedly climbed out, her 
bathrobe trailing after her.

Yuffie came immediately after, her face a pale-green. She pulled herself 
out of the sewer hole, her elbows planted firmly into the ground. 
&quot;Ugh...&quot; she groaned as she crawled away from the opening. &quot;I feel like 
a hungover sewer rat...&quot; she moaned. Lenna came up after her, and her 
blank face turned in her direction.

&quot;Maybe we should rest a bit.&quot; the soldier began, &quot;Find you some water 
and-&quot;

Yuffie glared at her critically. &quot;I appreciate the concern-or whatever 
you&#39;d call it-but I can&#39;t stop.&quot;

Lenna didn&#39;t press the issue, only shrugged and looked at Audrey who was 
all ready at the gate leading to the street. The pirate turned and gazed 
back at them with a smirk. &quot;Let&#39;s get to it then, eh?&quot; The red glow from 
the street lit her from behind.

The ninja sighed and pulled herself up from the ground, her clothes 
sweat-soiled and streaked in dirt. She and the special operative met 
Audrey at the gate, where they climbed over it one by one.

Once over, Yuffie got a good idea of where Audrey had taken them. Neon 
signs glared and shone in the narrow street, the clothesline banners and 
balconies doing a good job of blocking out the sun. Flyers for adult 
shows and escort services riddled the street like so much confetti, and 
tackily dressed women in high heels and loud hairstyles haunted certain 
parts of the long neighborhood. A barrel burned where a group of bums 
huddled around it, passing around a bottle of rum. Yuffie scratched the 
back of her head, a little nonplussed.

In comparison to where she had just been, this area seemed relatively 
unaffected. Perhaps the people here were used to such commotion and 
didn&#39;t let it stop their illicit activities. It seemed so odd, the 
casual disregard for danger and strife. Of course, Yuffie had been in 
these sorts of environments before-it was practically where she had 
gotten her start as a real thief. But...was it a sign of how much she 
had changed that she could no longer relate to this self-involved way of 
living? Or was it just the discomfort of self-awareness that had her 
tongue shrinking in her mouth?

&quot;You walk the world with a mirror, and you show the wrong-doers what 
they&#39;re doing wrong. You scare the evil away with their own reflection. 
Evil hates seeing itself for what it is. &quot;

Audrey patted her back harshly, knocking the air out of the ninja&#39;s 
lungs. &quot;So hero, how does it feel being back in your natural habitat?&quot;

Yuffie gazed at her sidelong and trailed along slowly when the pirate 
continued walking.

----------

He shook the glass of his rum and coke, the smooth jumble of ice cubes 
tinkling against the glass. His study had turned into a verifiable den 
of burden-the room dark and the dust that circulated like just so many 
thoughts that lingered in his head. The windows were blocked by the 
security barriers but thank the gods the electricity was still up. 
Without his conditioner his teardrop body would be just that-a big fat 
teardrop. Or a &#39;sweatdrop&#39; more accurately. Mack liked to be 
comfortable. As comfortable as possible. It kept his blood pressure from 
rising and his heart from giving out.

He chuckled to himself. Leaning back into the soft snow lion leather, he 
mulled over the delicate position he was in. A crime lord with a bad 
heart? Only his family knew of this. The others, the bloodthirsty bunch 
of thugs, would try to exploit him. It had all ready been attempted more 
than once-but his dear nephew Otter (quite the bloodhound) put a stop to 
any attempts at usurpation.

At the thought of his nephew however, the small parchment smile that had 
passed Mack&#39;s scraggled face soured.

He was sure this whole lock down business was his nephew&#39;s doing-and 
when he got a hold of the little bugger he was going to wring his neck 
of all those clever-minded quips he liked to use whenever he knew he had 
done wrong. There wasn&#39;t to be any commotion today...hadn&#39;t Mack made 
that clear? Otter was always the rambunctious sort, always jumping 
headfirst into problems without a clear idea of what he was doing. 
Usually, the thinking was left to his sister, Audrey. She was a wily 
one, but not even her quick mind was able to anticipate the betrayal 
suffered by her erstwhile friend-that little pain in the arse, Yuffie 
Kisaragi. It had been a sign of her weakness. It was why he kept her out 
of the important matters.

Mack&#39;s expression darkened. Speaking of Yuffie...Was it that the 
youngster had returned to his city? Was she the cause of this lock down?

It had only been half an hour since the barriers had gone up, and his 
bodyguards received nothing useful on their walkie-talkies. No one 
seemed to know where Otter was. This wasn&#39;t so out of the ordinary, but 
in this commotion he would&#39;ve reported in by now.

Then it occurred to Mack.

With a grunt, he sat forward and set his glass on the stand next to his 
chair. He turned on the lamp and with squinted chartreuse eyes he looked 
back to the door behind him where a large guard stood. Pulling slightly 
at his silk collar with a gnarled finger, the old man ordered in a 
baritone voice, &quot;Find Audrey. Now.&quot;

----------

&quot;Here we go...&quot; Henley breathed as he pressed into the wall and peeked 
around the corner. Ahead was the automated entrance into HQ. Two guards 
stood at either side of the bulletproof doors, rifles in hand. Next to 
the soldier on the right was another panel, this time with a retina 
scanner and mic. Pointed at the doors were two security cameras on 
opposite corners. The special operative looked back at Tifa, his round 
eyes lidded with thought. &quot;The security is more sophisticated on this 
one-no surprise there. We&#39;re going to have to sit tight and wait around 
here till someone important goes by.&quot;

&quot;And then what&#39;ll we do?&quot; Tifa breathed back, trying to seem casual as a 
group of armed men passed them by. &quot;Threaten the person to let us in or 
we&#39;ll kill them?&quot;

&quot;Pretty much.&quot;

Tifa sighed and shrugged, repeating what the man had said earlier, 
&quot;&#39;Work with what you got.&#39; And what&#39;ve we got?&quot;

&quot;Squat!&quot; Henley cheered in a quiet whisper, his jovial smile managing 
even a grin from the tense fighter.

Left with no choice, the two continued walking past the entrance to the 
police headquarters and followed the hallway the armed men a moment ago 
had taken. They came to yet another break room, this one messier than 
the others as it seemed someone had brought in orange juice and pastries 
for breakfast. There was only one other person in the room, and he stood 
in the corner with a cup of coffee, his unshaved face contorted in a 
frown as he pulled the lapel of his standard issue police jacket up to 
his ear. He seemed annoyed at the sight of Tifa and Henley, and turned 
his back on them as he continued to listen to the squeaky voice that 
seemed to come from the device attached to his coat.

Tifa sat down eagerly, suddenly aware of how tired she felt after all 
that had gone on since her arrival at Junon.

Henley sat down next to her, but rather than let his guard down his eyes 
seemed trained on the other man in the room. Baxter often told him to 
follow his instincts, to which he would jokingly reply that women 
wouldn&#39;t like him if he did. Now, however, the man willfully did as he 
had been advised, letting his sixth sense guide his focus.

Something was off.

The man in the corner looked like a cop and behaved like a cop...but a 
small detail Henley&#39;s unconscious had picked up nagged his mind that 
there was reason to stay alert. He glanced at his companion to see if 
she noticed anything. Tifa, oblivious, was eyeing a box of donuts on the 
other end of the table. Her hand was reaching beneath the cardboard lid 
when the cop&#39;s agitation led him to raise his voice just enough for her 
and the soldier to hear.

&quot;No I don&#39;t know where she is! Audrey is an adult! If she isn&#39;t at the 
gift shop then let her face the consequences later! I&#39;m busy! ...What do 
you mean he wants to me quit? Mack told you? Well what in the bloody 
hell is he thinking? Doesn&#39;t he care where Otter&#39;s disappeared to?&quot;

Tifa&#39;s fingers scraped the flakes off of a glazed donut when her hand 
reflexively clenched and her body went rigid. Without moving her head, 
she looked at Henley. The round-faced soldier jerked his head toward the 
door and the fighter gave a slow nod before carefully rising to her 
feet. Carefully, Henley slid his chair back as well, trying to keep it 
from squeaking against the polished floor. When Tifa shut the door and 
returned to his side, she made a motion with her hands like two objects 
coming from different angles and meeting at a point. Pincer maneuver. 
Henley nodded stiffly.

The jovial man liked physical confrontation about as much as he liked 
shooting-but above everything else he was a soldier, and all of his kind 
had a rudimentary knowledge of hand-to-hand combat. Tifa was no more 
eager than Henley was-sparring with Yuffie was one thing, but facing a 
cornered criminal in such a delicate setting was about as fun as 
wrestling a Bobomb.

But if she had to beat this man in order to see the girl she loved, Tifa 
didn&#39;t care if she were 300 pounds overweight and armed only with a 
toothpick-she&#39;d take down Alexander himself.

Steeled by this sudden resolve, the fighter moved into position at the 
man&#39;s left while Henley crept over to his right. The undercover crook 
was still engrossed in his conversation, his eyes closed as he set down 
his coffee and listened to the person on the other line. It wasn&#39;t until 
Tifa and Henley were literally two feet away that the man breathed into 
his receiver, &quot;Understood. I&#39;ll get it done then.&quot; He shifted his 
weight, about to turn around with a scowl on his flat face and a curse 
tickling his lips when Tifa reeled back a punch and slammed it into the 
back of the man&#39;s skull. His head snapped forward, whacking the wall 
like a rubber ball. Henley rammed into him then, taking hold of his 
right arm and twisting it up behind the criminal&#39;s back until it 
threatened to break.

Tifa took out the gun they had taken from Otter and his men, and pointed 
it at their new hostage. She wasn&#39;t much of a shooter, and she hated the 
feeling of recoil when a gun fired-but Jessie had taught her how to use 
a gun back when the blond had still been alive, when Avalanche still 
sought to do good in the slums of Midgar by blowing up reactors. She 
loaded the bullet into the chamber, then turned the safety off. Tifa 
made certain the criminal, now clearing the stars from his eyes as his 
face was pressed into the wall and turned her way, could see this fact.

Sweat stained the wall as the man struggled against Henley&#39;s hold. 
Despite his small stature, the soldier was able to keep his lock on the 
criminal&#39;s arm. The man gazed warily at Tifa as she spoke, her voice 
cold, &quot;Who&#39;re you working for?&quot;

The thug didn&#39;t answer. Henley increased the pressure on his arm and 
Tifa pressed the gun into his cheek. She grit her teeth, adrenaline 
pounding in her ears as she saw the fear flash in the man&#39;s eyes. There 
was no telling how much time they had before someone outside noticed 
something going on. &quot;I said who are you working for!?&quot;

&quot;Who do you think!?&quot; the man cried out, his voice strained beneath his 
panic. &quot;I&#39;m working for the only crime lord left in this city-MACK. Mack 
Camaron, you stupid tart!&quot;

&quot;What does he want with us? With Yuffie?&quot;

&quot;NOTHING!!&quot; The man spat. His eyes rolled in its sockets to glare 
momentarily at Henley, who leaned in to properly glare at the man as if 
he were an idiot. &quot;I mean it,&quot; he snapped. &quot;Mack didn&#39;t want any trouble 
with any of you. It was all Otter&#39;s doing. He wasn&#39;t supposed to bother 
you. It&#39;s bad for business! Do you really think the big man wants to 
threaten his profits by bothering a media target right now?&quot;

Tifa&#39;s brows pushed together in confusion. And she looked at Henley. The 
soldier looked back at her and shrugged. &quot;So you mean to tell me,&quot; The 
fighter began slowly with narrowed eyes. &quot;That he isn&#39;t seeking our 
heads for some sad bit of recognition?&quot;

The criminal snorted, his eyes rolling. &quot;Oh come off it, miss. The 
rubbish that goes on in movies doesn&#39;t happen in real life. Mack doesn&#39;t 
want any trouble with you. I don&#39;t want any trouble with you. My task is 
to find Otter and his idiot sister.&quot;

Tifa frowned. &quot;Sister? He has a sister? Is she somehow involved in all 
this?&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t know, miss. She ain&#39;t where she&#39;s s&#39;posed ta be, so I need to 
find her. I haven&#39;t got any idea how this factors in so there&#39;s no point 
trying to scare the info outta me.&quot;

Henley glared at the man suspiciously. &quot;You&#39;re giving all this 
information up quite easily for a man in your position.&quot;

&quot;My position?&quot; the criminal echoed with a harsh laugh. &quot;Boy, if you knew 
how many of us were crawlin&#39; here-abouts, you wouldn&#39;t be thinking my 
place was so important. As far as I&#39;m concerned, we haven&#39;t any trouble 
with you and I&#39;m not so keen on having my head blown off or my cover 
blown over something so banal.&quot;

Tifa glanced at Henley, then back at the man. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; She 
asked, still cautious.

&quot;Timber.&quot; the man returned simply. He seemed to relax when he saw the 
effect his words had on his captors. &quot;And no jokes, if you&#39;d please.&quot;

Henley bit his lip as the corners of his mouth turned upward.

Tifa resisted the urge to hit him. &quot;What were you going to do then, 
Timber, if you&#39;re mission was only to find Otter and his sister...what 
was her name?&quot;

&quot;Audrey.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, her.&quot;

The criminal shrugged as best he could. &quot;I was going to join the squads 
searching the buildings. It&#39;s possible that Otter and Audrey were locked 
inside a place that we couldn&#39;t readily get into.&quot;

Tifa looked at Henley, who blinked back at her. &quot;When are they lowering 
the barriers on the buildings?&quot; The round-faced soldier asked.

&quot;15 minutes.&quot; Then the man scowled. &quot;Speaking of which, you ninnies are 
making me late!&quot; he said irritably.

&quot;When are they lowering the security walls that are separating the 
sectors?&quot;

&quot;Dunno.&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you just lower the security walls?&quot; Tifa asked with a raised 
eyebrow.

Timber looked at her critically. &quot;Are you pants-on-head-retarded? I 
can&#39;t do that!&quot;

Tifa&#39;s finger flexed on the trigger, and the man&#39;s eyes bulged. &quot;So get 
someone that can.&quot; The fighter hissed.

The criminal could see his reflection in the brunette&#39;s stark eyes. He 
stammered nervously, &quot;H-Hey now, m-m-miss. I-I can&#39;t d-d-do that. Otter 
and Audrey will be t-ten times harder to find if-if I do that. J-just 
lowering the building seals, sector by sector, makes it easier on 
ourselves!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care what is easier for you. Some of your men shot at someone I 
care about. Someone has to be held accountable!&quot;

&quot;Is it so fair to make that person me!?&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;d rather run the risk of letting Otter find Yuffie first and 
killing her? Her only chance right now is getting out of the city and 
down to Junon Harbor below. Would you like to be the one to blame for 
letting something bad happen? Because every possible armed force will be 
raining down on your heads for killing a global hero should she 
die...and I&#39;ll be right there with them to make you pay.&quot;

The man paled. He struggled once more against Henley, and through a 
strained throat snapped, &quot;Would you kindly let go of me you daffy 
dingbat?? I&#39;ve got to find someone to lower those barriers!!&quot;

----------

&quot;Damn! DAMN IT!! The barriers! Of course, these stupid barriers! We 
forgot about them completely! How are we going to see Flubs if these 
things won&#39;t let us get inside the building?&quot;

&quot;Quit shouting, dimwit. This is just momentary. It&#39;s all ready been an 
hour since the barriers have gone up. The seals on the buildings should 
be gone in a second to allow for the police to do sweeps. They go by 
sectors. This one should be first.&quot;

&quot;But then that means...&quot;

&quot;That we&#39;ll either wait till the sweeps are done, or we do it in a jiffy 
before they get to Flubs house-which is just three houses down from 
where the police will start.&quot;

&quot;How long will the sweeps take?&quot;

&quot;Here? With all the contraband likely to be found?&quot; Audrey smiled 
viciously. &quot;I&#39;d say about two hours. Junon is stretched pretty thin.&quot;

&quot;Great! So now we have to find Mack under a time limit!&quot;

&quot;Oh that won&#39;t be the hard part. The hard part will be convincing his 
mother to even let us speak with him.&quot;

Yuffie tapped her finger on her arm, her eyes gazing up at the 
geometrically perfect building with rounded corners and faded metallic 
blue paint. Some of the thick barriers blocking entry had suspicious red 
stains that trailed downward to their roots. A crude TV antenna could be 
seen at the top-rather tall and most likely in violation of some strict 
building code.

&quot;So what do we tell her to let us through then?&quot; The ninja finally 
asked.

&quot;Nothing,&quot; Audrey said, picking dirt from underneath her short 
fingernails. &quot;You&#39;re going to have to break in and steal something 
valuable of hers. Offering to trade her back her item in exchange for 
Flubs service is the only way she&#39;ll let us see him when this sector is 
so hot with cops.&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s eyes rested on the young pirate&#39;s face, and the teenager could 
see that her guide was not kidding. &quot;How old is she? She&#39;ll try to stop 
me. I mean gawd I&#39;ve never even been in this place! It&#39;s not like 
I&#39;m...I&#39;m...&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Audrey snapped, her fierce gaze alighting on the ninja&#39;s 
discomforted face. &quot;You aren&#39;t what, princess? A criminal?&quot;

&quot;I was going to say I&#39;m not omnipotent! Every time I ever broke into a 
place it was always with a level of preparation-that&#39;s ninja basics 
airhead! To go into enemy territory without knowing what to expect is 
like pointing a gun to your head! You&#39;d just be asking for trouble!&quot;

Audrey&#39;s hands fell to her sides and for the second time that day, she 
seemed shock. &quot;You just admitted you aren&#39;t perfect...&quot; the redhead 
breathed with narrowed eyes.

Yuffie&#39;s cheeks flared and she crossed her arms huffily. &quot;I was always a 
helluva-lot better than you ever were at stealing things, if I remember 
correctly you friggin&#39; sea-rodent!&quot; When the embarrassment didn&#39;t 
evaporate with this heated statement, the ninja stomped her foot and 
snorted. &quot;Hmph! I&#39;d bet I could still do better than you could when it 
comes down to it!!&quot;

Audrey tongued her cheek, then jerked her head toward the house. &quot;So why 
don&#39;t you prove it you silly priss? Set your noble misgivings aside and 
let those nimble fingers do what your bless-ed sea god, Leviathan, 
granted them?&quot;

The ninja was advancing on her before the pirate could even make out the 
situation. Two hands gripped the front of Audrey&#39;s shirt, and though the 
redhead was taller than the Wutai-born princess, she still found herself 
stumbling to keep her balance. Yuffie was two inches away from her face 
when she hissed dangerously, &quot;Never...EVER speak of Leviathan like he&#39;s 
some two-bit mischief-maker, got me? His name is worth more than you or 
me combined so if I ever catch you getting fresh again I&#39;ll re-arrange 
that poor excuse of a face you&#39;ve got!&quot;

Audrey&#39;s hands came up and she spread them wide so that Yuffie could see 
the two cross scars on either palm. Briefly she wondered how she came to 
acquire them when the redhead&#39;s iron-like grip wrapped themselves around 
her wrists. For a brief moment, fear flashed in Yuffie&#39;s eyes when she 
realized the amount of strength behind the tight hold. It seemed that if 
the pirate squeezed any tighter, the ninja&#39;s slim wrists would snap like 
twigs. Beneath her momentary panic, Yuffie was reminded of the glimpse 
of muscle she had seen when Audrey had climbed the gates. Steroids? Or 
did the redhead really work that hard?

Yuffie was shoved back five feet and her body collided with Lenna&#39;s, who 
easily caught her. The soldier was giving the pirate a warning stare, 
her lips set in a thin disapproving line. &quot;Ease off.&quot; Yuffie said, the 
usually taut tone of voice that would accompany that phrase deflated and 
weak in the face of her new observations. Lenna&#39;s azure stare fell to 
catch the ninja&#39;s gaze for a moment before she took her hands off her 
shoulders and resumed her quiet surveillance of the nearby area.

The nineteen-year-old&#39;s wrist throbbed in a way that was alarming, but 
she refused to give Audrey the satisfaction of seeing her rub them. She 
only hoped her jacket covered the bruises that would no doubt begin to 
show. &quot;What have you been doing to yourself?&quot; Was the only thing Yuffie 
could bring herself to say.

&quot;Preparing.&quot; Audrey said flatly. She pointed at the building. &quot;Now are 
you going to do it or not? Or no...no, wait. Go ahead and &#39;talk&#39; to the 
old bird. Realize for YOURSELF that the only viable thing you can do 
right now is what I just told you. Remember, you aren&#39;t doing this to 
&#39;make nice&#39; with the bloody world! You&#39;re supposed to be doing this for 
Tifa.&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s shoulders tensed when she heard her love&#39;s name came from such 
a brash mouth-but something prevented her from snapping. Was it guilt? 
If she refused to do this, then could she say she was doing all she 
could to keep Tifa safe? &quot;What do I need to take?&quot; Yuffie asked, her 
eyes on the ground.

&quot;Anything that looks important.&quot;

&quot;You really don&#39;t know?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve only been here three times. The first two times Flub&#39;s mother 
didn&#39;t even let me into the house. The third time she ushered me so 
quick to Flub&#39;s room that I didn&#39;t even get a chance to peek at 
anything. Didn&#39;t help that she had a goddamn shotgun jammed into my 
back.&quot;

Yuffie raised her head to gaze scrutinizingly at Audrey. &quot;What have you 
ever needed found that you came here three times?&quot; she asked.

The redhead glared at her. &quot;None of your soddin&#39; business!&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s plenty of my business seeing as how I get the feeling 
there&#39;s something important you aren&#39;t telling me!&quot;

&quot;And what would you like to hear, eh? That I&#39;m using Flubs to search for 
my dead mummy and daddy?&quot;

Yuffie felt the need to be insulted on their behalf. &quot;Show some 
respect!&quot; She snapped.

Audrey crossed her arms and smirked. &quot;Says the girl who&#39;d kill a baby 
Cokatoli&#39;s mother for a bundle of Phoenix Downs.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got no right to talk to me like that.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; the taller woman barked, her stare glinting like the edge of a 
knife. &quot;Why don&#39;t I have a right to speak to you like this Kisaragi? Why 
don&#39;t I have the right to speak to you like you&#39;re a maggot squirming 
through a corpse? Should I show you respect? Is that what you&#39;re telling 
me? Because you helped stopped Shinra Inc.? Because you defeated the mad 
General Sephiroth and prevented Meteor from obliterating our Planet? 
When did YOU ever care about the Lifestream, or nature, or the people 
that populate this planet in all your misbegotten days!? NEVER!!&quot; Audrey 
half-screamed this last word, and her body trembled from pure rage as 
her fingers dug into her arms. Yuffie took a step back alarmed by this 
show of emotion. There was hardly ever a time that she came face-to-face 
with someone who could match her own fiery displays.

&quot;So you&#39;re a hero now,&quot; Audrey continued, somewhat calmer. &quot;Imbued with 
the knowledge of righteousness, glory, and all that poppycock that fills 
books and films. ...It was by chance that you happened to run into the 
right group of people at the right time. Since then you&#39;ve piggybacked 
your way to history and fame. But I know what you really are. You may 
think you&#39;re a little demi-god now, but that glint in your eye tells me 
the same runty thief that I used to know as a little girl is still there 
somewhere. Get your head out of the sand and realize that the things 
that have built you up as a savior are made of the blood and sweat of 
others you took advantage of.&quot;

Yuffie stared at her, quips and insults and feisty retorts sailing 
through her head like a maelstrom. But her mouth didn&#39;t move. She could 
only breathe and hope the pain in her chest was from something other 
than guilt.

A hand came to rest on her shoulder.

The ninja turned slowly to gaze at Lenna. The soldier had taken to 
watching the exchange, and though she was not accustomed to stepping in 
during such times, her mind suggested it appropriate. &quot;We all have our 
own paths, Yuffie. Yours was no less genuine than Cloud&#39;s...&quot;

At the mention of her former illustrious leader, the nineteen-year-old&#39;s 
expression soured. Moodily, she shrugged Lenna&#39;s hand off her shoulder. 
&quot;Don&#39;t touch me.&quot; she muttered in a subdued voice.

Audrey was still staring at her hard. Yuffie glared across at her, 
trying to will herself to say something when a familiar wail pierced 
through the air. The neighborhood residents paused in their activities 
to look up as if expecting some visible herald to be seen overhead. 
There was a loud rumble and the ground shook.

The building barriers were coming down.

----------

A/N: This will be over by next chapter, after which Yuffie and Tifa will 
be reunited and the original nature of this story will promptly come 
back into place. (okay so maybe I shouldn&#39;t promise it that way, but for 
the most part you&#39;ll be seeing more of what you know you love)

Also, to any new readers reading I&#39;d just like to apologize for the plot 
bunnies and occasional errors in facts that I managed over the course of 
the story. You are all reading the chapter one after the other. Remember 
that there was usually a span of about a month or two between updates 
(save for this one) so sometimes details got muddled or lost. In this 
particular part of the story, I got the time of day wrong. I think at 
one point I say it is evening and later say it is morning, then day. I 
meant to go back and edit this error, but like many things I never got 
around to it. Heck, I&#39;m STILL meaning to rewrite the first few chapters 
because I really feel that I can do them better now...but alas...

The title of this chapter, as you may have guessed (you clever fiends) 
comes from the song &#39;Modern Guilt&#39; by Beck. I couldn&#39;t come up with a 
name for the chapter on my own and didn&#39;t want to give it some generic 
title. I wanted it to have some level of meaning. I find it a little 
ironic that I&#39;m using yet another Beck song as an opening for a new 
chapter, but something about it seemed to fit the events and sentiments 
of the recent chapters under one neat umbrella. Whether or not you agree 
with this is up to you, at any rate, the chapter is finally up. I think 
we can all agree that&#39;s a good thing.

I would also like to say that military/police procedure, gun knowledge, 
and technology are completely beyond me. If I felt it would be 
interesting to the story to explain it in an accurate and realistic way 
I would--but as it stands I find that sort of thing to be bothersome and 
dull so I&#39;m sorry if my depiction of these things seems unrealistic or 
sloppy. At this point I&#39;d really just like to get Junon over with and 
get back to writing Tifa and Yuffie wuv.
