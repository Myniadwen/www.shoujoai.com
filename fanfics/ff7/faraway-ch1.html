<pre>It&#39;s been a long time, hasn&#39;t it? 

&quot;Yeah...&quot; 

I...I meant to tell you this, before... 

&quot;Before?&quot; 

Yes...this is...a dream, you know? 

&quot;I know...all I do now is dream...&quot; 

I&#39;m sorry... 

&quot;It&#39;s...not your fault. It&#39;s mine...for failing.&quot; 

You didn&#39;t fail. Try to...live your life, ok? For me? 

&quot;I&#39;ll...try.&quot; 

Promise? 

&quot;I promise.&quot; 

Sweet dreams...I... 

&quot;I know.&quot; 

------------------------------

Tifa Lockheart had always prided herself on being strong. When all the 
other girls in her hometown of Nibelheim were busy playing with dolls, 
she was adventuring with her group of friends, who granted, were a bit 
more...cowardly than she was, but they were like family. 

At twelve years old, after the untimely death of her mother, she met the 
legendary martial artist, Zangan. She watched the wizened old warrior 
teach the boys basic techniques in the town square, and was immediately 
enthralled. 

She wanted to learn then, needed something to fill the empty space left 
inside after her mother&#39;s death, needed something to preoccupy her. 
Everything reminded her of her mother, from her piano lessons to the 
sad, quiet boy named Cloud next door, whom her mother had always 
encouraged her to speak to. Learning was the answer; it would make her 
stronger, make her forget. 

Her father, so desperate to cling on to the last person he had left, had 
been adamant about not letting her train. Tifa begged, pleaded for him 
to allow her to learn, to fight. Eventually, he had reluctantly agreed, 
and Tifa began the tutoring that would eventually make her one of 
Zangan&#39;s most treasured students. 

That same year, she made a promise with Cloud under the night sky, right 
before he left to become a soldier, another faceless warrior. She prayed 
that he would become something great one day. 

That day never came. Three years after, a man named Sephiroth came to 
her small hometown with his meager entourage, and nothing was ever the 
same for her again. 

------------------------------ 

Now twenty years old, Tifa had pulled herself from the dregs of despair, 
and landed in a rather awkward situation. Now she worked for a rebel 
team named AVALANCHE, a group of terrorists determined to put an end to 
the evil organization, Shinra, Incorporated, that bled the lifeblood out 
of the planet with every action it took. 

Tifa was very dedicated to the cause, but she was beginning to think 
this particular plan she had wasn&#39;t such a good idea. She sat on the 
cold, stone floor of a torture chamber, mumbling to herself. 

&quot;A dungeon. You&#39;re in a dungeon that belongs to a pervert. Way to go 
Tifa. You just had to go alone, didn&#39;t you? You should have let Barret 
come to choke information out of this creep, but nooo, you had to be the 
tough one, &#39;I&#39;ll get info from the Don,&#39; you say. How stu--&quot; 

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; the voice, obviously female, had a soft, gentle lilt to it. 
Tifa almost thought she was hallucinating, but glanced up anyway, 
slightly surprised to see a girl standing there. 

&quot;Tifa?&quot; the girl asked. Long, light brown hair tumbled down her back in 
waves, her eyes were a calming, deep green. She wore a red dress that, 
on anyone else, would undermine their beauty, but on her it seemed to 
accentuate it. Tifa looked up at her for a moment later, furrowed her 
eyebrows in confusion. She moved closer. She knew this girl, recalled, 
briefly, her unpleasant ride in a chocobo buggy on the way to this 
terrible place, remembered a young woman sitting in a pitiful-looking 
park, a familiar young man sitting next to her. Her eyes narrowed. 

The girl, not at all uncomfortable with the scrutiny, extended her hand. 
&quot;Nice to meet you. I&#39;m Aeris. Cloud&#39;s told me a lot about you.&quot; 

Tifa took the offered hand, briefly laced their fingers together before 
she pulled away. This girl&#39;s hands were too soft. She obviously wasn&#39;t 
meant for a place like this. Finally, Tifa spoke to the girl, torn 
between curiosity and slight wariness. &quot;You were the one with Cloud in 
the park.&quot; 

&quot;Right,&quot; Aeris confirmed. &quot;with Cloud.&quot; Tifa saw the way her eyes seemed 
to brighten at the mention of Cloud&#39;s name, and she frowned. She turned 
away, and started to crack her knuckles, a nervous habit she had picked 
up years ago. 

&quot;Oh...&quot; she bit her lip, shuffled from side to side, tugged on the dress 
that she was wearing. She hated the dress, too bright and gaudy, nothing 
like Aeris&#39; choice. 

Aeris noted the change in mood, shook her head rapidly, moved, as if to 
touch Tifa&#39;s shoulder, and then stopped. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. We just met. It&#39;s nothing.&quot; Tifa rounded on her quickly, 
her eyes flashed, she stood tall, almost snapped out her next words. 

&quot;What do you mean, &#39;don&#39;t worry&#39;...about what?&quot; She heard the edge in 
her voice, saw the shocked look on Aeris&#39; face and softened her tone. 
&quot;No, don&#39;t misunderstand. Cloud and I grew up together, nothing more.&quot; 
She shifted her head to the side so that Aeris wouldn&#39;t see the lie so 
plainly written on her face. 

Aeris still seemed to sense she had hit a sore spot, and chuckled 
weakly, trying to ease the tension. &quot;Poor Cloud, having to listen to us 
call him nothing. Right, Cloud?&quot; She glanced over at a young woman Tifa 
hadn&#39;t noticed before...a woman who looked...familiar? Tifa took a step 
up to the other woman, gazed at &#39;her&#39; in confusion. 

&quot;Cloud?&quot; she mumbled quietly. The &#39;woman&#39; blanched, tried to make &#39;her&#39; 
way out of the room. Aeris laughed genuinely this time, and Tifa bit her 
lip when she realized she had a laugh as pretty as her face. 

&quot;Embarrassed?&quot; Aeris chirped. &quot;Come on, speak up!&quot; 

Tifa made her way to the other girl, stared at her carefully. It 
couldn&#39;t be...could it? 

No way, she thought. There is no way...the glow in those eyes...but why? 

&quot;Cloud?!&quot; she exclaimed, taking a step back. 

Cloud shuffled from side to side, groaned, shook his head. Tifa wasted 
no time asking him questions. 

&quot;Why are you dressed like that?! And what are you doing here?! 
Nevermind, what happened to you after the fall?! Are you hurt?!&quot; Cloud 
raised his hands, shook his head, and frowned. 

&quot;Slow down, let me answer. I&#39;m dressed like this because there was no 
other way to get here. I&#39;m alright. Aeris helped me out.&quot; 

Tifa turned away, closed her eyes, counted backwards in her head. It 
doesn&#39;t mean anything. Not a thing. Stop acting like this. 

&quot;Oh, Aeris did...&quot; she trailed off, leaving the room in an awkward 
silence. 

Cloud cleared his throat. &quot;Tifa, explain what you&#39;re doing in a place 
like this?&quot; Tifa glanced away from him, flushed in embarrassment. 

&quot;Yeah, um...&quot; She glanced over at Aeris. Their eyes met; Aeris took the 
hint, smiled. 

&quot;Ahem!! I&#39;ll just plug my ears.&quot; When she went to the other side of the 
room, and did just that, Tifa hid a smile behind her hand. This girl 
wasn&#39;t so bad. She turned to Cloud, gave him a sheepish grin. 

&quot;...I&#39;m glad you&#39;re OK.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks. What happened?&quot; 

Tifa sighed weakly, and began to explain the events that had led her to 
this place. &quot;When we got back from the Sector 5 reactor, we saw a weird 
man. Barret caught him and squeezed some information out of him.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s when the Don&#39;s name popped up.&quot; Cloud finished. 

&quot;Right, Don Corneo. Barret told me to leave the lech alone...but 
something&#39;s been bothering me.&quot; 

&quot;I see,&quot; Cloud mumbled, frowning. &quot;So you wanted the story straight from 
Corneo&#39;s mouth.&quot; 

Tifa nodded. &quot;Well, I made it here, but now I&#39;m stuck. Corneo is looking 
for a bride.&quot; She flushed, looked down at the ground. &quot;Everyday, he gets 
three girls, chooses one of them, and then... ...well...&quot; her blush 
deepened, and she made it a point to look away from both Cloud and 
Aeris. &quot;Anyway, I have to be the...girl for tonight.&quot; 

Aeris glanced over at her, frowned in thought. &quot;Sorry, but I 
overheard...If you know the three girls, there&#39;s no problem, right?&quot; 

Tifa blinked in surprise. &quot;I guess so, but...&quot; 

&quot;We have two here, right?&quot; Aeris asked. Cloud looked appalled, shook his 
head rapidly. 

&quot;No, Aeris! I can&#39;t involve you.&quot; 

&quot;Oh? So it&#39;s all right for Tifa to be in danger?&quot; Aeris retorted. 

Cloud looked taken aback, tried to find the right words to say. &quot;No, I 
don&#39;t want Tifa in...&quot; 

Tifa interrupted him, turned toward Aeris. &quot;Is it alright?&quot; she asked. 

&quot;I grew up in the slums...I&#39;m used to danger.&quot; She paused, stared at 
Tifa carefully. &quot;Do you trust me?&quot; 

Tifa bit her lip. This woman had helped Cloud when she wasn&#39;t able to, 
and had gladly offered help in a mission that had nothing to do with 
her... &quot;Yes. Thanks, Ms. Aeris.&quot; 

Aeris laughed, her eyes sparkling in mirth. &quot;Call me Aeris.&quot; 

&quot;He--y!!&quot; a voice called from upstairs. The group turned to see a 
burly-looking man standing at the entrance to the chamber. &quot;It&#39;s time 
ladies. The Don is waiting!&quot; He went back upstairs, mumbling all the 
way. &quot;I told ya not to wander around...I tell ya, women nowadays...Hurry 
up, will ya!&quot; 

Cloud stared at the two women. They stared back; Aeris giggled. &quot;I 
probably don&#39;t need to ask, but the other girl is...&quot; he closed his eyes 
and grimaced. &quot;Me.......right?&quot; 

Tifa nodded. &quot;You&#39;re right; there was no need...&quot; 

&quot;...to ask.&quot; Aeris finished with a smile. 

Cloud groaned and held his head. 

------------------------------ 

Tifa viciously kicked one of the Don&#39;s men in the stomach, watching him 
crumble at her feet, before she slipped out of the room, searching 
around for Aeris. 

&quot;I can&#39;t believe he chose Cloud...&quot; she snickered. &quot;Poor Cloud. I better 
hurry up and get in that room with Aeris before something happens.&quot; She 
winced at the thought of the Don finding out that Cloud was... 

&quot;Eek. Don&#39;t scare yourself now.&quot; She tensed when she heard a shriek from 
the torture chamber. 

&quot;Oh no...Aeris,&quot; she muttered, running toward the entrance. She reached 
the top of the stairs, and was torn in-between laughter and anger at the 
scene in front of her. A man chased Aeris around in circles, while she 
tried in vain to get away. Tifa rushed down the stairs, and when she 
reached the halfway point, Aeris made her way to her, with the man 
following behind. When she reached Tifa, she winced, and kicked the man. 

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; she said, closing her eyes. Tifa bit down a giggle as 
the man tumbled down the stairs. Aeris turned toward Tifa and heaved a 
sigh of relief. 

&quot;I&#39;m glad you came in time.&quot; Tifa smiled weakly. 

&quot;Seems as if you handled it pretty well yourself. Now, let&#39;s go help 
Cloud before it gets err...messy.&quot; 

Aeris nodded her head, and both women ran off to save Cloud. Aeris 
laughed to herself quietly; Tifa glanced at her. 

&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; she asked. 

&quot;Just...&quot; Aeris laughed again. &quot;Do you think the Don will be mad when he 
finds out that Cloud is a guy?&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Tifa shrugged. &quot;Who knows? Maybe he&#39;ll be a good sport 
about it, give us the info without causing any trouble. I mean, we&#39;re 
not pushovers or anything.&quot; she laughed. &quot;In fact, I bet he&#39;ll let us 
leave, no problem.&quot; 

------------------------------ 

Owowowowow...ouch...long fall. Who knew the Don had a trapdoor? Tifa 
thought woozily, stumbling before she collapsed again. 

Ugggh...sewers...sewage&#133;rats...gah...guess the Don isn&#39;t such a good 
sport after all. She coughed, gagged, stifled a scream when she saw a 
rat scamper past one of the walls. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw 
Cloud go to Aeris and help her up before he ran over to her. 

&quot;You alright?&quot; he asked her, helping her to her feet. She wobbled, then 
gasped. The Don&#39;s info...he had said Shinra was going to destroy Sector 
7... 

&quot;Man! This is terrible.&quot; she looked around. How would they get to Sector 
7 in time to save everyone? 

&quot;Well, the worst is over...&quot; Aeris murmured. A rumble shook the sewers; 
Cloud glanced around warily. 

&quot;Or maybe not...&quot; she said, readying her staff. 

The ground rumbled beneath them again, and Tifa took a step closer to 
Cloud and Aeris when she heard the clank of chains and heavy, monstrous 
breathing. A atrocious creature made its way out of the shadows, and 
Tifa grimaced when she saw a long trail of saliva make its way out its 
mouth. Cloud lifted his sword, Tifa crouched into a fighting position, 
and Aeris prepared a Fire spell. 

This was going to be a long day. 

------------------------------ 

Achy and weary, the group made their way out of the sewers, finding 
themselves in the place people called, &#39;The Train Graveyard.&#39; Tifa 
stretched, felt bones snap into place and winced. The monster Don Corneo 
had sent after them wasn&#39;t really much of a challenge, being dispatched 
easily after a few fire spells, but fatigue was wearing down on all of 
them, and Cloud yawned as he helped Aeris gain her footing on the 
skeleton of an old train car. 

&quot;Let&#39;s get through here quickly,&quot; he said, carefully walking across the 
train wreckage. &quot;We don&#39;t want to waste time.&quot; He glanced over at Aeris, 
seeming apologetic. &quot;Aeris, I got you mixed up in this...&quot; 

Aeris shook her head. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me to go home.&quot; Tifa glanced around. 

&quot;If we can just get past the trains that are lit up, we should be able 
to get out of here.&quot; 

Both Cloud and Aeris nodded, and they all made their way through the 
desolate labyrinth of ruined trains. 

------------------------------ 

Tifa made her way out of the train wreckage first, followed closely by 
Cloud and Aeris, and quickly headed to where she knew the pillar would 
be. She gasped in amazement and relief when she saw it, still standing, 
glinting bright and harsh, creating the strange illusion of an actual 
gray sky. She turned toward Cloud, almost smiled. 

&quot;We made it! The pillar&#39;s standing!&quot; Cloud scratched his head, then 
frowned, looked around. 

&quot;Wait! You hear something up above us?&quot; Aeris glanced around warily, 
then looked up. 

&quot;...gun fire?&quot; 

Tifa looked up as well, and saw the desperate battle above her head, 
watched in a mixture of fascination and horror as one of her comrades, 
Wedge, fell to the ground below with an odd, sickening crack. She choked 
back a sob, but Cloud was alert, ran toward the pudgy young man, lying 
crumpled on the ground. Tifa felt the bile rise in her throat. He looked 
so strange and twisted... 

&quot;Wedge!! You all right!?&quot; Cloud asked in concern. Tifa could have 
laughed at the stupidity of the question if she weren&#39;t so busy shaking. 
She felt a hand on her shoulder, saw Aeris glancing at her with those 
strange green eyes. Sympathy, but not pity. She heard Wedge weakly 
mumble a response to Cloud, an apology, a plea to help Barret...Barret 
was on the pillar? Cloud&#39;s voice snapped her back to reality; she pulled 
away from the strange, hypnotic safety of Aeris&#39; eyes. 

&quot;I&#39;m going up! Aeris, you look after Wedge.&quot; Aeris nodded, pulled her 
hand away from Tifa&#39;s shoulder, and Tifa wavered slightly before she 
thought of something. 

&quot;Aeris, do me a favor. I have a bar called &#39;7th Heaven&#39; in this 
neighborhood. There&#39;s a little girl named Marlene there...&quot; Aeris 
nodded, gave her a wavering, watery smile. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll put her somewhere safe.&quot; 

The next time Tifa saw Aeris, she would be in a helicopter with a Turk, 
and then the pillar would crash around them. 

------------------------------ 

&quot;Marlene...&quot; Barret whispered brokenly, sinking to his knees. They had 
made it to the playground in Sector 6, but the rest of the people in 
Sector 7... 

Tifa made her way to Barret, remembered Aeris&#39; parting words as she was 
taken away on the helicopter... Don&#39;t worry, she&#39;s all right. 

&quot;...Barret? Marlene is...I think Marlene is safe.&quot; Barret glanced up at 
her. 

&quot;...huh?&quot; 

&quot;Right before they took Aeris, she said, &#39;Don&#39;t worry, she&#39;s all right.&#39; 
She was probably talking about Marlene.&quot; Barret hopped to his feet. 

&quot;Rrr, really?!&quot; 

Tifa nodded, and started to smile, but her expression turned solemn when 
she remembered something else. &quot;But...&quot; 

&quot;Biggs...Wedge...Jessie...&quot; Barret whispered, echoing her thoughts. 

&quot;All three of them were in the pillar.&quot; Cloud murmured. 

&quot;Think I don&#39;t know that?&quot; Barret snapped. &quot;But...&quot; he slumped his 
shoulders. &quot;We, all of us fought together. I don&#39;t wanna think of them 
as dead!&quot; 

&quot;...And the other people in Sector 7,&quot; Tifa added sadly. 

Barret kicked at the ground angrily, clenched his fist. &quot;This is all 
screwed up! They destroyed an entire village just to get to us! They 
killed so many people...&quot; 

&quot;...Are you saying it&#39;s our fault? Because AVALANCHE was here? Innocent 
people lost their lives because of us?&quot; Tifa whispered sadly. 

Tifa shook her head, hugged herself tightly. &quot;...I don&#39;t know.&quot; 

&quot;What don&#39;t you know?! You don&#39;t believe me?&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s not that. I&#39;m not sure about...me. My feelings,&quot; Tifa mumbled. 

Barret sighed, shrugged helplessly, and turned to Cloud. 

&quot;An&#39; what about you?&quot; 

Cloud said nothing, and walked off. Barret scratched his head. 

&quot;Yo! Where&#39;s he think he&#39;s goin&#39;?&quot; 

Tifa blinked as realization hit her. &quot;Oh! Aeris!&quot; 

&quot;Oh yeah, that girl. What&#39;s up with her?&quot; 

&quot;...I don&#39;t really know...but she&#39;s the one I left Marlene with.&quot; Barret 
clenched his fist and frowned. 

&quot;Damn! Marlene!!&quot; He glanced at Tifa. &quot;Tifa. There ain&#39;t no turnin&#39; back 
now.&quot; He walked off, and Tifa glanced back at the Sector 7 gates before 
following. 

No turning back. 

------------------------------ 

So where are we now? You try to do something right, and it goes wrong. 
Always. Then you wonder, what&#39;s the point? Is there one? Maybe. Tifa 
glanced up at the wire that led to the upper world. The sky. She hadn&#39;t 
seen it in such a long time. She had spoken to Aeris&#39; mother with Cloud 
and Barret, Marlene was alright, and now they had to bring Aeris back 
too. It was the least they could do. Aeris was a friend, all that woman 
had left. 

And it&#39;s my fault she&#39;s there anyway, Tifa thought bitterly. 

&quot;Can we climb it?&quot; she asked a child near them, who glanced up at the 
wire with a bewildered expression. 

&quot;Yeah. It leads to the upper world,&quot; he responded distractedly. Barret 
pumped his fist. 

&quot;Alright! We&#39;ll climb the wire!&quot; Cloud shook his head. 

&quot;There&#39;s no way we can do this. You know how far it goes up?&quot; 

&quot;There IS a way!&quot; Barret protested. &quot;Look! What&#39;s that look like?&quot; Cloud 
raised an eyebrow. 

&quot;Just a normal wire.&quot; 

&quot;Oh yeah? Well, to me it looks like a golden shiny wire of hope.&quot; 

Tifa glanced at Cloud, who glanced at the child, who shrugged. Cloud 
looked up. Tifa nodded. 

&quot;You&#39;re right. This is the only way to save Aeris...&quot; she murmured. 
Cloud shrugged. 

&quot;Ok, that was a bad analogy, but, Barret, I understand how you feel. 
Let&#39;s go!&quot; 

With that, they began the climb to the Shinra Headquarters. 

So, this is what heroes do, I guess. Tifa glanced down briefly and 
fought a dizzy spell. 

&quot;Oh boy...Aeris, I hope you and your mother appreciate this...&quot; 

------------------------------ 

The upper world. It didn&#39;t seem much different from the Midgar below, 
Tifa mused, with its cold, metallic harshness and the endless night. She 
had been in the dark so long, she wondered if the sun still shone 
anywhere anymore. The Shinra building was a massive, hulking thing, 
intimidating and unknown, lights flashing, illuminating the three 
&#39;terrorists&#39; in light for a few moments. Barret turned to Cloud. 

&quot;Hey, you oughta know this building well.&quot; 

Cloud scratched his head. &quot;...Not really, now that I think about it, 
this is the first time I&#39;ve ever been to the Headquarters.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ve heard about this place before. Every floor above the 60th is 
special and not easy to get to, even for employees,&quot; Barret said. &quot;Must 
be where they took Aeris. The security&#39;s pretty light now. Alright, 
let&#39;s go!!&quot; He ran toward the entrance, and Tifa shook her head. 

&quot;Wait a second! You&#39;re not thinking of just going right through the main 
entrance, are you?&quot; Barret glanced at her, and had the good grace to 
look sheepish. 

&quot;Well, what does it look like!? I&#39;m gonna kick some Shinra butt and...&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s not going to work! We&#39;ve got to find another way...&quot; 

&quot;Ain&#39;t gonna be no other way! If we keep wastin&#39; time like this, 
Aeris&#39;ll...&quot; 

&quot;I know that! But if we get caught here...&quot; she glanced at Cloud. &quot;Hey, 
Cloud. ...What should we do?&quot; 

Cloud put his finger to his chin in thought, shifted from side to side. 
After what seemed like ages, he responded with, 

&quot;Let&#39;s bust on in!&quot; 

Barret cheered and Tifa smacked her forehead. 

------------------------------ 

Tifa rubbed her shoulder and slumped in relief against a wall. &quot;Oh, 
&#39;let&#39;s bust on in,&#39; he says.&quot; Cloud gave her a sullen look. 

&quot;Well, Barret said that security was light. I mean, I didn&#39;t know there 
were going to be so many soldiers to fight.&quot; He glared over at Barret, 
who shrugged. 

&quot;%#!&amp;!...&quot; he mumbled. &quot;It don&#39;t matter now, we&#39;re in the clear. All we 
need to do is stay quiet and find Aeris.&quot; 

&quot;Find her where?&quot; Tifa asked. &quot;We don&#39;t even have all the keycards. 
We&#39;re stuck on this floor.&quot; 

&quot;Well,&quot; Cloud said. &quot;I guess we&#39;ll have to find someone who does.&quot; 

Tifa blinked. &quot;But...who would be stupid enough to give us keycards?&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;d be surprised,&quot; Cloud muttered. &quot;Let&#39;s look around.&quot; 

------------------------------ 

&quot;Okay...so...there were people stupid enough to give us keycards...&quot; 
Tifa mumbled to herself later on. They had been able to eavesdrop on a 
meeting between the heads of Shinra, and now they cautiously followed 
Hojo, the head of Shinra&#39;s Science Department, who had Aeris in 
containment. Tifa shivered when she remembered the strange man saying he 
was going to breed Aeris. Like some sort of animal... She shook the 
thought out of her head. They just needed to get there in time. 
Everything would be all right. 

Hojo moved toward an illuminated glass enclosure, gazing at some sort of 
creature within. 

&quot;My precious specimen...&quot; he murmured. Something about the way he said 
it made chills go up Tifa&#39;s spine. He left the room, and the group came 
out of hiding. Tifa went over to the enclosure and stared at the strange 
creature inside. It looked like some sort of feline. Its coat was 
crimson, and the tip of its tail was a bright spark of red flame. It had 
a number of tattoos, and one golden eye was closed shut by a long, 
menacing scar. Tifa tapped the glass, and the creature gazed up at her 
with an oddly human expression of melancholy. Tifa gave it a sympathetic 
look. 

&quot;Precious specimen...?&quot; she whispered. &quot;Is it going to be used for a 
biological experiment?&quot; 

Cloud looked around the room until his gaze stopped at a metal 
container. He went over to look at it, and gasped. &quot;Jenova...&quot; Tifa 
glanced over at him, and ran over to him quickly. He stumbled backwards, 
she caught him before he fell. 

&quot;Jenova...Sephiroth&#39;s...So...they&#39;ve brought it here.&quot; Cloud whispered. 

&quot;Cloud, be strong!&quot; Tifa exclaimed. Cloud glanced over at Barret. 

&quot;Did you see it?&quot; 

&quot;See what?&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s moving...still alive?&quot; 

Barret took a look inside of the container. &quot;Where&#39;s its $#&amp;&amp; head? They 
whole thing&#39;s stupid. Let&#39;s keep goin.&#39;&quot; 

Tifa helped Cloud up, and they headed to Hojo&#39;s lab. 

------------------------------ 

&quot;Aeris!&quot; Cloud called out. Aeris was sitting in the same sort of 
containment unit the strange lion creature had been in. Hojo glanced 
over at them. 

&quot;Aeris? Oh, is that her name? What do you want?&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;re taking Aeris back.&quot; Cloud said. 

Hojo shook his head. &quot;Outsiders....&quot; 

Barret glared at him. &quot;Shoulda noticed it earlier, you...&quot; 

&quot;There&#39;s so many frivolous things in this world,&quot; Hojo said 
dramatically. Barret aimed his gun-arm at him. Hojo chuckled. &quot;Are you 
going to kill me? I don&#39;t think you should. The equipment here is 
extremely delicate. Without me, who could operate it? Hmm?&quot; 

Cloud made a disgusted noise under his breath, and Hojo nodded. 

&quot;That&#39;s right. I recommend you think things out logically before you 
make any rash decisions. Now, bring in the specimen!&quot; 

Aeris moved slightly in the tube, and the lion creature from before 
raised up from a hole in the floor. Aeris panicked, took a step back as 
the creature growled at her. She banged on the glass. 

&quot;Cloud, help!&quot; Cloud angrily turned to Hojo. 

&quot;What do you think you&#39;re doin&#39;?!&quot; 

&quot;Lending a helping hand to an endangered species...both of them are on 
the brink of extinction...If I don&#39;t help, all of these animals will 
disappear.&quot; 

Tifa gaped in horrified shock. &quot;...animal? That&#39;s terrible! Aeris is a 
human being!&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re gonna pay!&quot; Barret growled. 

&quot;Barret! Can&#39;t you do anything?&quot; Cloud asked. Barret aimed his gun at 
the enclosure. 

&quot;Awright!! Step back!&quot; 

&quot;Stop!!&quot; Hojo cried, but Barret ignored him and opened fire on the cage, 
and it began to glow. Hojo ran over to the door. 

&quot;Wh...what are you do--Oh! My precious specimens...&quot; He leaned in 
closer, and the lion creature leaped out of the chamber and pinned him 
to the ground. 

&quot;Now&#39;s our chance to get Aeris!&quot; Cloud said. He ran in, and after a 
moment, emerged with Aeris. She sighed in relief. 

&quot;Thanks Cloud.&quot; Cloud nodded, but frowned and gazed over at the 
elevator. 

&quot;Cloud...what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Tifa asked. 

&quot;...The elevator is moving.&quot;
