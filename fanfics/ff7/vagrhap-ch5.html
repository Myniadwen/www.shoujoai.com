<h1>Vagrants Rhapsody (part 5 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/pnkpanther9.html">PnkPanther9</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff7/vagrhap-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Early mornings were a spectacle of change. The cold of night and the 
darkness that went with it was washed away by the warm colors of 
morning&#39;s all encompassing glow, riding on its golden waves a feeling of 
renewal and rebirth. The day was young again. It was a reminder of the 
future, a mystery in itself, a blinding wall that, with time, was 
steadily broken down.

Yuffie Kisaragi woke gradually, her mind immediately beginning to churn 
with all the things she had to worry about. She needed to pack her 
duffel bag. She needed to check her maps for a good route to take. She 
needed to see if...

The girl sat up, the exhaustion quickly leaving her. Kicking her 
blankets away, the girl leapt from her bed, hurrying into the hall.

Tifa&#39;s door was open.

A frown forming on the girl&#39;s face, she turned and looked down the hall 
to see the kitchen light was on. Walking carefully towards the light, 
she moved surreptitiously, her bare feet making little noise on the 
carpet floor.

Peeking around the corner of the hallway into the kitchen, Yuffie 
squinted in the face of the light.

Standing in the kitchen was Tifa, dressed in a brown leather jacket, 
blue jeans, a burgundy turtleneck sweater, and her old boots. She was 
biting her nail anxiously, a nervous look on her face.

Yuffie&#39;s eyes widened at the sight of the backpack set at the fighter&#39;s 
feet.

Shuffling out from where she hid, the ninja pointed at the pack. 
&quot;...Tifa?&quot;

The fighter jumped and looked around, her eyes wide. &quot;Yuffie!&quot; she 
looked to where the girl was pointing and bit her lip. &quot;Um, Yuffie about 
what you said last night-&quot;

The woman didn&#39;t get to finish her sentence.

In the next instant, she was sitting on the floor, her tailbone hurting 
and a babbling girl latched around her neck.

&quot;OHMIGODTIFAYOU&#39;VEMADEMESOHAPPY!&quot;

Stunned and bewildered, Tifa could only pat the ninja awkwardly on the 
back, a dubious smile on her face.

----------

&quot;Okay, so where were you thinking of heading again?&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;ve figured this all out in my head before I came and visited 
you. First I thought of stopping at Cid&#39;s for a bit before continuing on 
down the highway to Corel. From there, I wanted to go have some fun in 
Gold Saucer.&quot;

&quot;And after that?&quot;

&quot;No idea.&quot;

&quot;Well it&#39;s a plan, I guess...&quot;

&quot;Hey, it&#39;s a road trip! It isn&#39;t supposed to be organized!&quot;

It was later in the morning and Yuffie had changed out of her pajamas. 
Having gathered all her things, the ninja explained her intentions for 
the next few days.

Yuffie gestured to the large map she had laid on the kitchen table. 
&quot;Look at all this, Tif! New stuff has come up since we traveled with 
Avalanche! It would be impossible to plot every single move we made!&quot;

Tifa shrugged, &quot;If you say so.&quot;

Folding the map, Yuffie stuck her tongue out at her, &quot;Don&#39;t sound so 
scared, or I won&#39;t let you come!&quot;

The woman leaned against her kitchen counter. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I just haven&#39;t 
gotten out much in a long time so this whole thing is kind 
of...intimidating.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;ll be with you the entire time, remember?&quot;

Tifa nodded, smiling softly.

Yuffie bent down and picked up her duffel bag, which had been lying at 
her feet. She was wearing the same outfit from when she arrived, though 
she didn&#39;t have her scarf on. &quot;Okay, Tif. I think that&#39;s everything. 
You&#39;ve got all you need? Remember, since we&#39;re gonna be riding my bike, 
we can&#39;t take too much. Gotta save room for all the things we&#39;re gonna 
buy later, if ya know what I mean.&quot;

Tifa nodded, picking up her backpack. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve got all I need right 
here.&quot;

Yuffie smiled. &quot;Great! Now I get to introduce you to my mean little 
monster!&quot; The girl began to walk to the front door.

Tifa blinked as she stared after her. &quot;Your mean little what?&quot; She began 
to follow her, only to stop and gaze at the garage door. Expression 
turning into one of determination, the woman left her home, locking the 
door behind her as she did so. Little did she know...

...She&#39;d never return to unlock it.

Turning as she pocketed her house keys, Tifa saw Yuffie standing next to 
her motorbike. Putting on her helmet, the ninja grinned at her. &quot;This, 
Tifa, is my custom bike. Her name&#39;s Deevo. She rides like a dream...See 
here? Custom pipes! Look! It&#39;s even got my initials on the seat!&quot;

Tifa grinned absently as Yuffie proceeded to point out different things 
about the bike, the esoteric babble going straight over the fighter&#39;s 
head.

&quot;...Anyways,&quot; Yuffie said, as she finished her proud rant, &quot;Here. This 
is your helmet.&quot; The ninja handed Tifa the helmet before she swung a leg 
over the bike. Taking hold of the handlebars, she looked up expectantly 
at her companion, who was strapping on the helmet with a look of 
apprehension.

After a moment, Tifa asked, &quot;What?&quot;

Yuffie raised a slow eyebrow. &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to get on?&quot;

Tifa blinked. There was only one seat...granted there was ample space 
for her to squeeze in, but that meant-.

&quot;Rusty. Just get on the bike. It won&#39;t bite you, I promise.&quot;

The fighter blushed. &quot;It&#39;s not that, it&#39;s just-&quot;

&quot;Hey, if you&#39;re afraid of falling off or something, don&#39;t be. Just hold 
on to my waist and you&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

Sighing, the woman decided it best not to explain. Awkwardly, she got on 
the bike behind Yuffie, slowly reaching around the girl&#39;s waist.

&quot;See, that wasn&#39;t so hard, now was it?&quot; The ninja asked, an amused smile 
on her face as she started the bike. Revving the engine, the motorbike 
roared a bit before pulling out of its parking space and speeding down 
the street. Startled, Tifa held on to Yuffie tighter, breathing 
frantically, &quot;Oh Shiva, help me...!&quot;

Yuffie was smiling brightly, wisps of her dark hair blowing about her 
eyes. Turning slightly, she shouted, &quot;Y&#39;know, I used to have serious 
problems with motion sickness. But ever since I got this bike, I got 
over it!&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Tifa shouted, sounding somewhat nervous.

&quot;Yeah!&quot; Yuffie turned her head forward again. &quot;I followed some of the 
tips Cloud gave me on the Highwind. I haven&#39;t thrown up once! ...But I 
still do kinda get nauseous on ships.&quot;

&quot;A lot of people have problems with seasickness.&quot;

&quot;Not like I used to. I couldn&#39;t ride a ship without blowing chunks.&quot;

&quot;...Can we not talk about vomit and motion sickness? I think...I think 
I&#39;m getting a little dizzy.&quot;

Yuffie glanced back, a smirk on her lips. &quot;You&#39;ll get used to it, Tif!&quot;

The ninja began to speed up as they merged onto the highway. Tifa let 
out a groan and squeezed her eyes shut as she buried her face in 
Yuffie&#39;s back.

----------

Rocket Town. It was a proverbial place of accomplished dreams, new 
aspirations, and budding families.

These days, the town felt more like a city, it&#39;s streets getting busier 
and it&#39;s population growing. Cid Highwind, like many people who grew up 
in small towns, found cities to be distasteful, and so, was unsatisfied 
with the change occurring around him. How was anyone supposed to get any 
rest in such a place? Rocket Town was becoming a growing city, a place 
of constant activity that rivaled that of Corel&#39;s.

Disgruntled, the pilot yearned to light up a cigarette, to curse to his 
heart&#39;s content about all the things happening to his hometown. But he 
couldn&#39;t...

Because he quit.

Running a shaky hand through his blonde hair, the man let out a sigh. He 
was sitting on the front steps of his home, dressed in nothing but his 
pajamas. Silently he glared at passing cars and at the distant 
construction work-taking place somewhere in the city.

How he hated calling Rocket Town that.

A city.

He wanted to thread a stream of curses so colorful that surely these 
city bastards would get out of his town... But no. He couldn&#39;t.

Because he quit.

Burying his face in his hands, the man groaned in frustration.

The screen door creaked open and Shera poked her head out, carefully 
placing her glasses on her face. In her other arm, she seemed to be 
cradling Misty. The baby was cooing. &quot;Cid?&quot;

Cid grunted in response.

&quot;Cid...what&#39;re you doing sitting out here in your PJ&#39;s?&quot;

Another grunt.

The woman rolled her eyes. &quot;Well...breakfast is ready, caveman. I&#39;m 
sorry I couldn&#39;t get any dinosaur eggs ready for you.&quot;

At this, Cid&#39;s head shot up. Food was ready? That was good. It would 
help ease his cravings...

Getting to his feet, the pilot slipped in through the screen door and 
shuffled into the kitchen. Shera was rocking Misty in her arms softly as 
she held a bottle to the baby&#39;s lips. Faintly, she hummed a nameless 
lullaby. Cid grinned proudly at the sight of his child. Putting a light 
hand on the small of Shera&#39;s back, the man gazed down at his baby. 
&quot;Mornin&#39; sweetheart.&quot; He said softly. It was a side of him that, thus 
far, only Shera and Misty had seen. The side of a tranquil and loving 
father and husband.

It was the best-kept secret in the world.

Sitting down to his already served plate, Cid began to eat.

Shera moved to the kitchen sink, looking out the window to the street as 
she did so. A frown formed on her face. &quot;Cid?&quot;

Cid looked up. &quot;What is it?&quot; the man grunted.

Shera nodded outside. &quot;I think two of your friends are outside...&quot;

The pilot frowned. &quot;Whazzat?&quot; standing, he went to the screen door...and 
his mouth dropped.

&quot;Tifa? Yuffie? Is it really you?&quot;

Sure enough, the two girls were there, both pulling off helmets as they 
climbed off their bike. Tifa looked somewhat pale, but Yuffie looked her 
usual, energetic self...albeit, she was older now.

&quot;Hello, Cid!&quot; Yuffie greeted with a skip.

Tifa followed the girl as she moved down the path to his door. &quot;Hullo, 
Cid...&quot; the older woman said, sounding quite faint.

Cid opened his screen door all the way, a lopsided grin forming on his 
face. &quot;Well hell! Come on in you two!&quot; he stepped aside as they passed 
him. Letting the door slam shut, he followed them into the kitchen. 
&quot;How&#39;ve you two girls been doing? I haven&#39;t talked to either of you in a 
while...Come to think of it,&quot; he pointed a stern finger at Tifa, &quot;You 
haven&#39;t visited at all since you moved to that Tiesmire place! What&#39;re 
you, some kinda hermit? Or did&#39;ja jes get tired of seeing my scruffy 
mug?&quot;

&quot;Both, I think.&quot; Yuffie said jokingly. Tifa and Cid both shot her looks.

&quot;I&#39;m not a hermit.&quot; Tifa said firmly, looking for a moment as if she 
were okay again. Then she sat heavily in one of the kitchen chairs. 
&quot;...Do you think I can have a glass of water again?&quot; the woman said 
weakly.

Shera nodded, &quot;Why certainly!&quot; she moved to get a glass from the 
cupboard, but Cid waved her away. &quot;Hey, hey! Yer&#39; holding Misty! I&#39;ve 
got it!&quot; Taking a glass and filling it with water, the pilot handed it 
to Tifa. &quot;Here ya go.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Cid...and I&#39;m sorry I haven&#39;t visited in all this 
time...it&#39;s just that...&quot;

Cid stopped her. &quot;Bah, forget it, kid. &#39;Least yer&#39; here now. 
Though...I&#39;m wonderin&#39; what the two of you are doing here together and 
riding around on some motorbike for?&quot; he looked to Yuffie. &quot;Didn&#39;t you 
get motion sickness?&quot;

Yuffie rocked back and forth on her heels, smiling smugly. &quot;Nope, not 
anymore! Or at least, not on my bike. But Tifa isn&#39;t used to riding on a 
motorbike, it seems...I was lucky she didn&#39;t throw up on my head.&quot;

&quot;Oh...Yuffie please don&#39;t talk about vomit!&quot; the fighter moaned.

Cid shook his head. &quot;The heck are you two doing?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re going on a road trip.&quot; Yuffie explained, sitting down in one of 
the chairs. &quot;We&#39;re gonna continue on to Corel soon, though. But we 
wanted to stop by and say hello and all that.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Stop by and say hello&#39;? Like hell you fucking-&quot;

&quot;Cid!&quot;

Cid winced under his wife&#39;s sharp glare. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, honey, it just 
slipped!&quot; Rubbing his neck, the man muttered. &quot;Look, why don&#39;t you guys 
at least stay fer some lunch or somethin&#39;. Then you can be on your way 
before dark.&quot;

Yuffie nodded. &quot;That sounds okay...doesn&#39;t it, Tif?&quot;

Tifa nodded, color returning to her skin. &quot;Yeah, that sounds fine to 
me.&quot;

Cid clapped his hands, &quot;Great! But first I&#39;ve gotta have breakfast. I&#39;m 
hungrier than a f-&quot; Shera glared at him, and the man tumbled over his 
words. &quot;F-f-flippin&#39; fat chocobo...&quot; The man rubbed his neck as he sat 
back down at his seat, choosing to focus on eating on his meal than 
looking up at his wife.

Yuffie giggled. &quot;Nice save, Cid...I&#39;d never thought I&#39;d see the day.&quot; 
She leaned back in her chair. &quot;Foul-Mouth-Highwind, go clean? Nothing 
short of a miracle. I was almost envisioning you teaching your kid HOW 
to curse.&quot;

Cid shot her a sharp look, &quot;Yeh? Well...thought wrong didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;It was either he did that, or I walked out on him. Isn&#39;t that right, 
Cid?&quot; Shera smiled at him teasingly.

Cid grunted again, bent over his plate.

Tifa leaned on the table. &quot;So how&#39;ve you two been doing lately? How&#39;s 
the city?&quot;

&quot;Like crap.&quot; Cid said brusquely. Immediately after saying this, he 
lifted a finger, halting Shera before she could even snap at him. &quot;We 
agreed I could say &#39;hell&#39;, &#39;damn&#39;, and &#39;crap&#39;, Shera!&quot;

The woman, disgruntled, shook her head in exasperation and returned her 
attention to her baby.

Tifa bit back a smile.

Cid, food still in his mouth, turned his head slightly toward Tifa. 
&quot;Lately, all I can hear is construction work and traffic. Cars honking, 
people shouting...&quot;

Shera sighed loudly. The woman seemed to have a boost in confidence over 
the three years. Tifa wondered if it was because she was now a mother. 
&quot;Oh please, Cid. It isn&#39;t that bad. They haven&#39;t torn down any of the 
original buildings.&quot;

&quot;Not yet.&quot; The man said grimly in response. He waved his spoon in the 
air. &quot;You jes&#39; see. There&#39;ll be buildings tumblin&#39; soon. And then, I&#39;m 
gonna hav&#39;ta tear those jerk-offs a new one...And no, I can say that!&quot;

Shera rolled her eyes.

Cid, satisfied, took another bite of his meal before sitting back. 
Looking at Yuffie, he grunted. &quot;An&#39; what about you?&quot;

Yuffie looked over at him with a look of indifference. &quot;What about me?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;re you doing, running around and whatnot...don&#39;t yer pops mind?&quot;

The girl snorted, her eyes hardening. &quot;Did that ever stop me before?&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t the two of you make up&#39;r somethin&#39;?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t?&quot;

&quot;The guy&#39;s more pigheaded than you or Barret put together, Cid. Of 
course I didn&#39;t make up with him.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;d you two fight about this time?&quot;

&quot;Hey Cid,&quot; Tifa interjected, sparing Yuffie a response. Glancing briefly 
at the girl, the fighter smiled sweetly at the pilot. &quot;Where&#39;s the 
Highwind? I haven&#39;t seen it in ages!&quot;

At mention of the man&#39;s pride and joy, he preened. &quot;She&#39;s over at the 
airport...it&#39;s on the other side of town.&quot; At these last words, however, 
the man soured. &quot;They wouldn&#39;t let me keep &#39;er near the house. Said it 
would cause &#39;complaints&#39;...like I give a damn! This is my town!&quot;

&quot;City.&quot; Yuffie corrected pointedly.

Cid turned to her as if he were going to finally release all of the 
curses welled up inside of him, so Tifa and Shera hurriedly tried to 
defuse the situation.

&quot;I&#39;ll start making lunch! What would you all like?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll hold the baby!&quot; Tifa said, standing quickly.

&quot;Sandwiches!&quot; Yuffie exclaimed, popping up in her seat.

Cid blinked at them all. &quot;What the hell&#39;s wrong with you people? ...It&#39;s 
still morning!&quot;

----------

&quot;I don&#39;t get how they could build all this so fast...do you? I don&#39;t. I 
sure as hell don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;They built Tiesmire pretty quick...remember, Cid?&quot;

&quot;Yeah...but still...this...this just isn&#39;t natural.&quot;

&quot;Well of course it isn&#39;t...or else we&#39;d all still be in caves and 
trees.&quot;

Seeing as how they had finished lunch rather early, Cid offered to take 
both Yuffie and Tifa to see the Highwind for old time&#39;s sake. Gathered 
in his dusty truck, this one a different model from Tifa&#39;s, they drove 
off to the airport, leaving Shera back at home with Misty.

Sitting between Yuffie and Cid (so as to prevent any possible arguments 
or stepping of tails), Tifa conversed with the pilot with a sense of 
obligation. She had, after all, neglected to visit.

Yuffie, sitting at the passenger window, chose to gaze outside, her hair 
falling into her eyes as she propped her head up on her fist.

&quot;So, you come here and work at the airport?&quot; Tifa asked Cid.

The pilot rubbed his neck with his free hand. &quot;Kinda...I mean, I work on 
the Highwind, and that&#39;s in the airport...&quot;

Tifa shook her head as she smiled in exasperation.

As they neared the airport, the Highwind came into view; it&#39;s metallic 
body gleaming in the sunlight. Hovering patiently, it waited for the 
return of its owner.

Driving up to the security gate, Cid flashed an ID, and the guard waved 
them through. Entering the airport grounds, Cid sped over to the hulking 
air ship, a large grin spreading across his face. &quot;There she is, ladies. 
Ya miss her?&quot;

Tifa smiled. &quot;Of course, Cid.&quot;

&quot;Not me.&quot; Yuffie grumbled, eyeing the air ship with a look as she 
climbed out of the truck.

&quot;Changed a few things here n&#39; there,&quot; Cid said as he moved to the ship, 
&quot;But it&#39;s still the same as you guys last remember it. I just souped it 
up a bit since Meteor.&quot; He began to climb up the ladder to the deck, and 
Tifa and Yuffie followed him.

The fighter&#39;s mind stirred with memories of Junon and the leap of faith 
she did when trying to escape from Scarlet and her Shinra troops. The 
short flashback caused her breath to quicken and her adrenaline to pump.

Reaching the top, Tifa paused as she looked around the deck. &quot;Oh 
wow...it&#39;s been ages.&quot;

&quot;Tif, hurry it up! I don&#39;t like hanging around in high places!&quot; Yuffie 
cried, sounded nervous.

Not able to fight back the smile that spread across her face, Tifa 
pulled herself up, turning as she saw Yuffie scramble onto the deck. The 
girl looked pale. &quot;Ugh...this reminds me of two many barf sessions...&quot; 
the girl grumbled.

Cid, opening the door into ship, called to them. &quot;Oi! C&#39;mere, you two!&quot;

They went to him, and together the three entered the ship, the wind 
rushing behind them as they shut the doors. Cid gestured around, his 
face beaming. &quot;Bringing back any memories, ladies?&quot;

Yuffie nodded, clamping a hand to her mouth. Tifa patted her shoulder 
sympathetically.

The pilot, rolling his eyes, gestured for them to follow him. They went 
up the stairs to the second floor, and there Cid led them to the 
conference room. The room seemed largely unchanged, except there was now 
a large flat screen monitor installed at the back. Cid patted one of the 
chairs. &quot;I was gonna renovate this room...but I decided not to. It&#39;s got 
its own charm, y&#39;know? And &#39;sides...&quot; the man chuckled. &quot;The hell do I 
know about decorating?&quot;

Tifa smiled as she sat in her old chair, the one she always sat in when 
the group would gather to discuss. Yuffie sat in her chair, two seats 
away. Leaning back and placing her feet on the table, the ninja sighed. 
&quot;I think this is the only room I liked in the whole ship. I&#39;m glad you 
didn&#39;t change it, Cid.&quot;

Tifa frowned at her softly. &quot;Why&#39;s this your favorite room, Yuffie?&quot;

Yuffie grinned weakly. &quot;Because it was the only comfortable place to 
sit.&quot;

Cid rolled his eyes, &quot;Come on, lemme take you to the bridge.&quot;

Standing, the two followed the pilot as he led them back down the 
stairs. Tifa, grinning in amusement, nudged Yuffie and pointed to a spot 
in the corner. &quot;Remember? You&#39;d always sit there moaning and groaning.&quot;

Yuffie grimaced. &quot;Yeah...don&#39;t remind me. With Cid&#39;s terrible flying I 
nearly fell into the wires twice.&quot;

Cid glared back at her sharply. &quot;You calling me a bad flyer?&quot;

The ninja raised an eyebrow at him. &quot;Yeah, I am! How do you think I got 
sick all the time?&quot;

&quot;Actually,&quot; Tifa said, &quot;I remember you liked to fool around on the deck 
a lot the first week we rode the Highwind.&quot;

Yuffie flushed pink. &quot;So?&quot;

Cid pushed the doors to the bridge open, &quot;So, she&#39;s saying it was your 
fault ya got sick, not mine!&quot;

The ninja grumbled a low, &quot;Stupid old coot...&quot; as she passed the pilot 
and entered the bridge with Tifa. The fighter looked around, feeling 
something stir in her chest as she saw the large view windows, the 
panels and the pilot&#39;s booth. Walking slowly, she moved toward the tall 
glass windows, the sunlight washing her in a golden shower of light. She 
could remember pacing here, occasionally gazing out at the passing world 
below as they searched for Cloud, pained with the knowledge that he was 
somewhere hurt and she wasn&#39;t there to help him.

&quot;...Tifa?&quot;

The fighter stirred from her thoughts, turning to see Yuffie and Cid 
gazing at her. The ninja took a small step forward. &quot;You okay? You got 
all spacey and sad looking.&quot;

The woman blinked. &quot;Oh...I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m fine.&quot;

&quot;You sure?&quot; Cid grunted.

Tifa nodded, managing a weak smile.

Cid shrugged. &quot;All right...I&#39;m gonna go check something. You guys can 
look &#39;round if ya want.&quot; The pilot left.

Yuffie was still gazing at Tifa with concern. &quot;It&#39;s weird, ain&#39;t it?&quot; 
she said after a moment.

Tifa blinked at her. &quot;What is?&quot;

The young girl gestured around her, turning on the spot as she did so. 
&quot;All this. I guess I never thought I&#39;d see it again.&quot;

The fighter nodded mutely, looking down at her shoes.

&quot;Lots of memories here, some bad...some good. It&#39;s bittersweet, but it&#39;s 
good to remember this stuff. It defines us, y&#39;know?&quot; Yuffie shoved her 
hands into her back pockets and walked to Tifa. Pushing the fighter 
softly with her shoulder, the girl smiled softly. &quot;But we&#39;ve gotta keep 
in mind, that that&#39;s all they are now. Memories.&quot;

Tifa blinked and looked around her. &quot;Yeah...&quot; the woman looked at the 
girl, and the two locked eyes.

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

Both jumped as they turned to see Cid standing there, hands crossed and 
a deep frown on his face.

Yuffie stuck his tongue out at him. &quot;Mind yer own business old man!&quot;

Cid looked to Tifa with a raised eyebrow. The fighter could only shrug 
meekly. Taking another moment to glare at the two, the pilot uncrossed 
his arms. &quot;You guys seen all you want?&quot;

Yuffie looked out the window. &quot;Yeah. We should probably get going now, 
Tif.&quot;

Tifa nodded, and Cid waved for them to follow him.

Leaving the airship, they drove back to the pilot&#39;s house, where Shera 
was waiting with Misty. The ex-scientist smiled as they pulled into the 
driveway. &quot;How&#39;d it go? Did you like seeing the Highwind again?&quot;

Tifa nodded as she climbed out of the truck. &quot;It was nice.&quot;

&quot;Real spiffy.&quot; Yuffie added.

Cid ran a hand through his hair. Shutting the door, he asked, &quot;So you 
guys gonna head on out now?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, we&#39;ve still got a day&#39;s drive ahead of this.&quot; Tifa said, walking 
to the sidewalk, Yuffie following her.

&quot;You sure you girl&#39;s don&#39;t want anything before you go? Maybe something 
to take with you?&quot; Shera asked.

Yuffie shook her head. &quot;Nah...thanks though, Shera.&quot; The ninja leaned 
over the fence as she planted a kiss on Misty&#39;s head. &quot;See ya babe! 
Don&#39;t start walking and talking without me here to see it, okay?&quot; Tifa 
leaned over as well, stroking Misty&#39;s small hand. &quot;Bye bye, baby...&quot; she 
breathed, smiling.

Cid threw an arm over Shera&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Well...you guys come back any 
time now, y&#39;hear?&quot;

Yuffie picked up her helmet, as did Tifa. Strapping it on, Yuffie sat on 
the bike. &quot;Will do, Cid! And keep your mouth clean while we&#39;re gone!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll make sure of that.&quot; Shera said, shooting the pilot a look.

Tifa laughed as she sat behind Yuffie. Wrapping an arm around the girl&#39;s 
waist, the fighter waved. &quot;Bye Cid, bye Shera!&quot; And with that, the two 
sped down the street, their motorbike roaring as they did so.

The couple watched as they turned onto another street and out of sight.

Rubbing Shera&#39;s shoulder, Cid frowned. &quot;Hey, Shera?&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; The woman looked up at him. &quot;Yes? What is it?&quot;

&quot;Do you get the feeling...no. Never mind.&quot;

It was Shera&#39;s turn to frown. &quot;What is it, Cid?&quot;

&quot;Nothing...hey, you wanna take Misty to the new park they built off in 
the middle of town?&quot;

The woman gave her husband a shrewd look before nodding. &quot;Yes...that&#39;d 
be nice.&quot;

Together, the family went back to their home.

----------

A/N: I don&#39;t like this chapter much...and come to think of it, this is 
the first time I&#39;ve ever written Cid Highwind. I found it frustrating, 
because I couldn&#39;t have him cursing, due to the stories rating. Well...I 
just hope you all liked it.
