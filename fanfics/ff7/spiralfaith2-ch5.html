	&#147;What, no, not now.&#148;
_____________________________________________________

	&#147;So Spin,&#148; Kerek laughs, &#147;What are you doing here.&#148;

	&#147;What do you know&#148; she replies, pointing her gun directly
at him.

	He laughs loudly before his face turns cold (colder).  &#147;You
are of me.&#148;

	&#147;What?&#148;

	&#147;We are emotions manifested into the realm of dreams.&#148;

	&#147;??&#148;

	&#147;I am an emotion of sadness that took over the boys
conscious, and became a physical being in the realm of dreams.&#148;
&#147;Zero is his dreams, what he wishes he was, Gary and Ike are his
need to find himself.&#148;	He turns to face her, &#147;the &#145;Spiral&#146; is his
hatred for all things, and the &#145;Fate&#146; are his will to do something
about it all.&#148;


	&#147;No, no, I can&#146;t be, I came here two years ago.&#148;

	&#147;You are his emotion of love, which he lost two years
ago.&#148;
_____________________________________________________

	&#147;Well, I think I love you.&#148;

	&#147;You love me?&#148;

	&#147;Yes&#148;

	&#147;  (Laugh) Are you kidding.&#148;  &#147;Like I&#146;d ever love you,	(Laugh)
you homeless freak!&#148;
_____________________________________________________

	&#147;What.&#148;

	&#147;He told a girl about his feeling and she destroyed his
heart, then you became a real being.&#148;

	&#147;You are an emotion, and you belong to me!&#148;  &#147;Don&#146;t try
and fight it give in and except your&#146; fate!&#148;

	Two years ago May 7:

	&#147;Great pizza Mario,&#148; says Amber, as she smiles widely at
her friend.  Suddenly something catches her eyes.  She turned and
looked.  Standing in her eyesight was a dirty young girl.  She was
wearing nothing more than a filthy shirt, with rips in random
places.  Her hair would&#146;ve been red if it weren&#146;t covered in dust.
Her body was small and fragile, yet her red eyes had a look of
confidence (mixed with a little confusion).  The mystery girl takes
two steps towards the one eyeing her.  Suddenly her legs give
from under her, but Amber was there to catch her.

	&#147;Who are you,&#148; ask the dirty young woman.

	&#147;My name is Amber, and you are,&#146; she asks her future
lover.

	The girl looks at her, confusion stuck in her eyes.  Her
body and mind where very tired, but she had to answer.	As she
tried to think of a name her vision stared to twist and spin.
&#147;Spin.&#148;

	Spin falls unconscious in Amber loves grip.  &#147;Spin&#148; she
begins loudly, but quickly she softens her voice, &#147;what a beautiful
name.&#148;

	Two years ago, May tenth:

	&#147;&#146;I like her&#146; Amber thinks, &#145;a lot, wish she felt the same,
but she didn&#146;t understand last night.&#146;	She walks into the bedroom
with a tray.  She enters to find Spin (her hyper active bed mate)
under the covers, rolling around, wrestling a pillow. &#147;You okay&#148;
she asks with a laugh at her new lovers playful antics.  Spin smiles
and nodded, then returned to the top to the bed.  Amber gets into
the bed brining the tray with the eggs and bacon on it.

	&#147;MMM, smells good&#148; Spin said, practically shoving her
nose into the food.

	&#147;You don&#146;t eat with your&#146; nose,&#148; Amber sighed (still
smiling) as she removed Spin from the food, and picks up some of
the egg.  &#147;Open wide,&#148; Amber instructs.  Spin obeys (overdoing
it) and happily except the food from Ambers fingers.  &#147;So, do you
know what a relationship is&#148; Amber asks, attempting to sound
casual about it.

	Spin puts her hand to her chin, &#147;us?&#148;  Ambers eyes widen
as she hears Spin say that, &#147;you mean it?&#148;  Spin nodded as she
takes some of the food into her hand (now clean) and shoves the
food into Amber&#146;s mouth (a little hard, but Amber realized by
then, that it might take a while before Spin could be counted
Normal, eat alone safe).  &#147;So, where do you come from?&#148;  Amber
takes some more food and gently feeds it to Spin.

	Spin continues feeding Amber before she answer (and
starts to mimic Ambers gentleness more and more each time.)  &#147;I
don&#146;t know&#148; she whines, &#147;I can&#146;t remember anything before I met
you.&#148;

	&#147;Oh, Spin,&#148; she replies (forgetting the question
completely) cuddling Spin.

	Now: The Battle With Kerek:

	&#147;No, no, I am just an emotion!&#148; Spin screams, tears
threaten to take over her eyes.

	&#147;My emotion.&#146;

	&#147;You are right,&#148; Spin calls, &#147;I can&#146;t run from my fate.&#148;
She draws her gun and points it at him.  In return he hold his
sword in her direction.  &#147;Only, I will not except it.&#148;	Kerek
charges, with an uncharacteristic smirk on his face, and swings his
blade, which collides with the side of her gun.  Sparks fly with
each collision.  Finally her gun collapses form the hits, and she
draws another. She fires off a bullet but Kerek easily deflect it.
He charges again, this time his fist hits her in the head, knocking
her over (and throwing her gun a few feet).  He holds his sword to
her face in front of her face.

	&#147;Are you ready to give into fate yet?&#148;

	She grabs the umbrella from under her and prepares to
counter.  &#147;No&#148; she remarks before opening the umbrella into his
stomach.

	&#147;You can&#146;t change my fate only I can,&#146;

	&#147;Done&#148; Yuffie yells.

&#147;He can take my body. But there is one thing he cannot take from
me.  And that is my Pride!&#148; Vegita DBZ.

	&#147;Why is this happening?&#148;

	&#147;He has to wake up.&#148;
_____________________________________________________

Inside of the Headquarters:

	&#147;Yuffie, nothing has changed yet&#148; Amber sighs, staring at
the window (attempt to find Spin).  &#147;What if it doesn&#146;t work?&#148;

	&#147;I have an idea,&#148; interrupts Tifa.  &#147;We found out who he
lives with right?&#148;  Jered nods.  &#147;Lets send them an e-mail saying
that the kid is in the hospital!&#148;

Spin:

	&#147;I am not part of you!&#148;

	Kerek smiles, knocking her gun away right as she pulls the
trigger.  A bullet flies past his face as he swings his blade at her.
She dodges and falls backwards.  &#147;Can&#146;t you do better Spin,&#148; he
laughs.  He swings another time, this time colliding with her gun,
cutting it in half.  Spin throws her gun (piece). She pulls out
another gun and fires.	The bullet nicks is face as he charges her.

	Heero fires off his cannon and blast the wolf &#145;Fate&#146;s head
off.  &#147;Trowa, where is Wufie?&#148;	The COM link doesn&#146;t go off
with a reply.  Heero turns and see both f his friends bleeding (and
dead) of the side of the building.  &#147;What!&#148;

	&#147;Tomoyo&#148; Sakura screams as a large armored wolf pulls
down her love. She flies back down, and grabs her love&#146;s arm.
&#147;Tomoyo, hold on,&#148; she yells over the wolfs loud roar.	Threw the
sound of the wolfs growl, she hears a gun go off.  The wolf
suddenly lets go and falls to the ground.  &#147;Nina,&#148; Sakura yells
brightly, pulling Tomoyo up onto her wand.

	&#147;Good thing I came, huh,&#148; Nina ask, &#147;Snoozer!&#148;

	&#147;I am not the Snoozer!&#148;

	Another wolf charges Sakura and Tomoyo (who just
landed).  A bright flash hits it and throws it two feet (as it dies a
painful death).  &#147;Hey Sakura, Tomoyo,&#148; says an energetic Eliza.

	&#147;Eliza&#148; Sakura exclaims.

	&#147;Dammit, Kerek!&#148; yells Spin, hitting Kerek in the face,
knocking him to the ground.  Kerek leaps back up, with sword in
hand, and takes a stab at Spin.  She gracefully dodges and hits him
with the butt of her gun.  He falls to the ground, and then gets up
to one knee before he fells cold metal on his forehead.  He looks
up to stare down the barrel of a gun.  &#147;Game over.&#148;

	&#147;You think so,&#148; he says, holding the tip of the blade to her
throat.  She pulls the trigger, but the click of an empty gun is the
only thing that comes from it.	He lowers the sword before
stabbing her in the stomach.

	&#147;People are not ruled by their memories!&#148; Rodger Smith,
Big O
