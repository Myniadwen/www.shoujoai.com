<h1>Spiraling Faith (part 1 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/spiralingfaith.html">Spiraling Faith</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Hey!  I need to tell you all some stuff before the story can get 
going.  First of all, this story is brought to you by the good people 
at Joe&#146;s Diner (Kidding).  Actually the people at Shoujo-Ai Fan 
Fiction Archive bring it to you. Also I have to give credit for the 
world and slight inspiration (Major inspiration) by David Rasmussen 
and the Card Captors Remastered story.  Oh and have fun reading my 
story.  

         Now I shall introduce my characters before the story gets 
going.  

         Spin Dormen: 
         Neck length Red hair
         Light Red eyes
         Spin is a detective for the small Nippon police force known 
as the Green Army.  She fears absolutely nothing unless her lover, 
Amber, is around, then she cries on a dime.  Her best friend is her 
partner, whose name is Tifa.  

         Tifa Lockheart:
         Long Black hair that stops at her knees
         Dark Brown eyes
         Tifa is Spin&#146;s detective partner in the Green Army, and the 
more responsible of the two.  She cares for three things more than 
anything else.  One: Her love Yuffie, Two: Her best friend Spin, and 
Three: Her job.

         Amber Jootey:
         Smooth Red hair to her waist
         Dark Green eyes
         Amber is Spin&#146;s important somebody, and the best cook in town 
(a Dream Tokyo).  She owns a restaurant in down town and is very 
famous for her food.  

         Yuffie Kisaragi:
         Short Brown hair
         Light Brown eyes
         Yuffie is a more light hearted and blunt person. She says 
what&#146;s on her mind at all times, especially to Tifa (Her lover).  She 
also works for the Green Army as Hand-to-Hand combat trainer on her 
free time.  She is also in tenth grade. 

         Kerek Quenthous (Zero):
         Messy Silver Neck Length hair
         Dark Blue Eyes
         Kerek, or Zero is a mystery to everyone who talks to him.  
Supposedly he has Dreams of the Waking World, but are they really 
dreams, or something more.

Episode one:  Collision Course (Finding the Wanderer)

    ------------------------------------------------------------

            &#147;Are you ready to see the child&#148;

            &#147;Yes, of course.&#148;

            &#147;Please Tell us if it is your boy&#148;

            &#147;Don&#146;t worry doctor we will.&#148;

            &#147;Is that your&#146; son?&#148;

            &#147;No (Sob) that is not our son&#148;

            &#147;I am sorry&#148;

    ------------------------------------------------------------

Green Army Headquarters:

         Spin gets off of her yellow bike and removes her helmet after 
chaining the bike to a pole.  She shakes her short red hair around 
then walks over to the front door.  At the door stands the guard, whom 
dresses in the Green Army suit (A Green Jacket, Green jeans, with a 
white shirt hid under the jacket) his hair is spiked blond and blue 
eyes.

            &#147;Hey Cloud&#148; Spin says as she got to the door.  She dig 
threw one of the pockets on her uniform. 

            &#147;You&#146;re late&#148; Cloud states smiling at Spin, who smirks as 
she find her ID Card.

            &#147;Is Tifa here yet?&#148;  Spin asks while running her card 
threw a scanner.  She then puts the card up then grabs the door handle 
and waits for his answere.

            He smiles and laughs, &#147;of course.&#148;  Spin just laughs and 
enters the building.  

            She walks until she comes to the front counter.  &#147;Hey, 
Lucca, where is Tifa?&#148; She asks picking up a donut out of Lucca and 
Marle&#146;s box of donuts, which they usually share anyway. Lucca has 
short purple hair and glasses, which stand out on her beautiful face.  
Marle has long blond hair, which she keeps tied back.  Her eyes are 
also blue.

            Lucca turns and looks at who was talking before answering.  
&#147;You&#146;re late, Cid&#146;s gonna be pissed.&#148;

            &#147;Yeah, Yeah, busy night with Amber,&#148; Spin laughs, &#147; can 
you tell where Tifa is?&#148;

            &#147;Down girl, she is in you&#146;re two&#146;s office, with the new 
case.&#148;

            Spin thanks her then heads of to her office.  On the way 
she runs into a few job buddies, and her boss, Cid.  They talk for a 
bit.  Cid tells her that she was late every day this week, and Spin 
responds by telling him that Tifa and her are the best.

            You&#146;re late&#148; Tifa says right as Spin enters the room.  
&#147;Cid isn&#146;t happy.&#148;

            &#147;I know I talked to him,&#148; Spin says setting down her bag, 
&#147; thanks for smoothin&#146; him over before he got to me.&#148;  Tifa just 
shrugs.  &#147;Anyway, we all can&#146;t get her as early as you&#148; Spin states 
sticking her tongue out at Tifa.  After she pulls paper out of her bag 
she walks up behind Tifa and rest on the back of her chair. &#147;So what&#146;s 
the case?&#148;

            Tifa grabs her bottle water from her desk drawer.  After 
swigging some she answers &#147;some guy who claims to have memories from 
the waking world.&#148;

            Spin gets of the back of the chair and puts her left hand 
onto her chin.  &#147;Maybe he was dreaming?&#148; she thinks aloud.  &#147; Give me 
the report,&#148; She requests.  Tifa hands her the report while drinking 
some more water.  

            The report reads:

            Name: Unknown
            Age: Unkown
            Hair: Silver (Messy and neck length)
            Eyes: Blue
            Build: Medium

            Found in Dreamer Mall ( Mid Tokyo) disoriented and 
mumbling.  Claims to have memories of the Waking World.

            &#147;Pretty weird huh?&#148; Tifa says putting the water back in 
her drawer.  

            &#147;Yeah, but, why is this a case for the best&#148; Spin replies, 
&#147; or even a case at all?&#148;

            &#147;Well, what if he actually came from the Waking World?&#148; 
Tifa asks rhetorically.  &#147;That means there is a way to move between 
realms&#148; she continues, &#147;That is a big deal whether you want to admit 
it or not.&#148;

            Spin set the folder with the report in it down.  &#147;Guess 
you are right.&#148;  She then grabs her sunglasses off of her desk, &#147;Lets 
go to the mall,&#148; she says pulling Tifa by the hand and smiling, &#147;we 
gotta job ta do.&#148;

Dream Mall (Mid Tokyo): 

            The mall was a large building.  It has lots of food 
courts, stores, gyms and movie theaters.  Spin loves that place and 
would spend the whole day there.

            &#147;Hey, Tifa where was he found&#148; Spin asks while looking 
around the mall with sparkles in her eyes.  No matter how many times 
she is here, it always amazes her.

            Tifa grabs Spin by the hand and drags her away from her 
spot in the center.  &#147;Trust me you&#146;ll know the place,&#148; she says 
smiling.  

            &#147;Hey this is the Pizza place where I met Amber&#148; Spin says 
staring blankly at the restaurants promotional sign.  &#147;Hey, he was 
here?&#148;

            Tifa smiles and begins to enter, &#147;Wow, can&#146;t get anything 
past you,&#148; she states with a laugh.  At the counter she asks to talk 
to the employee who was on duty.  

            &#147;So, he was really out of it&#148; Spin says to the worker.  

            &#147;Yeah, kinda spooky, and he kept on saying something about 
someplace called &#147;Earth&#148;.&#148;

            &#147;Right.&#148;  Just then a beeping sound starts to come from 
one of Tifa&#146;s pockets.  She pulls out a beeper and looks at the 
number.

            &#147;Hey, where&#146;d you get that?&#148; Spin asks while staring at 
the beeper.  

            &#147;Got it from Yuffie for my birth day yesterday.&#148;  &#147; It&#146;s 
the boss,&#148; Tifa sighs, &#147;Spin lets go.&#148; 

Green Army: Bosses office:  

            &#147;Did you get any information?&#148; Cid asks as Spin and Tifa 
took seats in the middle of the room.

            &#147;Not really&#148; Spin answers for both of them.

            &#147;Really, damn, that&#146;s bad.&#148;

            Tifa stands up &#147;Hey, it has only been about an hour since 
we got the case.&#148;

            Cid stands and walks over to his windows, which have the 
shades down.  &#147;Both of you, come here&#148; He commands.  They obey.  Cid 
pushes up the shades &#147;Look up&#148;. They obey once again, and what they 
see scares them.  Floating in the sky is a large rose- colored orb 
that almost looks like a fireball.  &#147; Do you know what that is?&#148;  They 
shake their heads.  &#147; First the Waker, and now this,&#148; Cid says walking 
over to his desk and pulling out a cigarette, &#147; they have to be 
connected.&#148;  Cid lights the smoke stick and inhales, then lets out 
some smoke.  &#147;You got to figure this out now!&#148;

Later that night, Spin and Amber&#146;s apartment:

            &#147;Just lie down and let me take care of you,&#148; Amber says 
pushing Spin down on the couch and taking her jacket off.  Then she 
flips Spin over and forces her onto her face.  Spin then lies there 
and enjoys Amber working her pains out of her back.  &#147;So how was your&#146; 
day?&#148;  Spin lays there for abit and enjoys Amber&#146;s loving touch.  
&#147;Hey, Spin, how was your&#146; day?&#148;

            Spin awakes from her dream (or Semi-Dream), &#147;Okay, got a 
new tough case.&#148;

            &#147;Oh, tell me about it baby&#148; Amber says as if she were 
talking to a child.

            &#147;Well, some guy was in the mall,&#148; Spin starts, &#147;at the 
Pizza place where we meet.&#148;  Spin lets out a sigh of pleasure then 
continues, &#147; any way, he supposedly has memories of the Waking World,&#148; 
she lets out another sigh, &#147;weird huh.&#148;

            &#147;Yeah, and it sounds tiring.&#148; Amber continues to work 
magic on Spin, &#147;Oh you&#146;ll never guess what I saw at work today.&#148; 

            &#147;Some fat lady,&#148; Spin jokes.

            &#147;Well, yeah, but I also saw big pink ball in the sky&#148; 
Amber says while still messaging Spin&#146;s back.  &#147;Hey, lets go to bed.&#148;

            &#147;I am to tired to get up&#148; Spin whines.

            &#147;Well, I guess you&#146;re to tired for what I had in mind&#148; 
Amber says smirking as she walks seductively towards the bed area.  

            Spin jumps up and runs behind her, &#147;I guess I ain&#146;t as 
tired as I thought,&#148; she laughs.

Tifa and Yuffie&#146;s place:

            &#147;So Yuffie, how was school,&#148; Tifa asks while eating her 
microwave able diner.
.
            &#147;Well, I got sent to the principle for getting in an 
argument with the teacher&#148; Yuffie mumbles before walking up and 
hugging Tifa from behind.

            &#147;You did what?&#148; Tifa sighs putting down her fork.  

            Yuffie begins to kiss Tifa on the back of the neck, &#147;I was 
arguing with the teacher,&#148; she says between kisses.  

            &#147;That isn&#146;t going to work this time Yuffie,&#148; Tifa says 
sternly, &#147;No matter how good it feels.&#148;

            &#147;What feels good?&#148;  &#147;Oh and the principle wants to speak 
with you, Miss Guardian&#148; Yuffie laughs.

            &#147;Oh, am I gonna punish you, in a little bit, c&#146;mon&#148; Tifa 
says, taking one more bite of food then pulling Yuffie into the 
bedroom.  

Saturday Morning: Tifa and Yuffie&#146;s Bedroom:

            Tifa lays there awake (as awake as possible in the world 
of Dreams) with Yuffie sleeping happily on her.  It is Saturday, Spin 
and her&#146;s day off, or so she thinks. 

She doesn&#146;t care what was happening with Yuffie at school, or with the 
whole Waking World memory thing, all she wants to do was lay there 
with Yuffie forever.  But it doesn&#146;t matter what she wants.  

            Tifa almost falls back into her sleep, but her beeper goes 
off.  &#147;Almost wish you didn&#146;t give me anything Yuffie,&#148; she thinks to 
her self as she grabs the beeper of the nightstand next to the bed and 
checks it.  &#147;What does he want?&#148;  It is Cid, she has to call him, and 
so she does.  

            &#147;Hello, Cid, what do you want.&#148;  

&#147;I am with Yuffie.&#148;  

&#147;Mind your&#146; own life.&#148;  

&#147;I don&#146;t care if its weird for a guardian to sleep with the one they 
take care of.&#148;  

&#147;What do you want?&#148;  

&#147;Oh, he is where.&#148;  

&#147;You call Spin yet.&#148;  

&#147;She is waiting for me!&#148;

Later that morning: Tokyo (The Daidouji Residence)

            &#147;Hey, it isn&#146;t that big of a deal Spin&#148; Tifa says pulling 
up to a large gate in her nice, clean, red car, &#147;so I was late, me and 
Yuffie where up late.&#148;

            &#147;Yeah I heard, so why don&#146;t you punish her&#148; Asks Spin as 
she exited the vehicle.

            &#147;None of your&#146; business&#148; States Tifa, who then crossed her 
arms over her chest and walks up to the gate.  There stand two female 
guards who had guns in plain sight.

            &#147;C&#146;mon, tell me, I&#146;ll understand.&#148;

            &#147;We&#146;re here about the guy.&#148;  The guards let them in. 
&#147;Well, every time I start to get mad, she kisses me on the neck and&#148; 
she stops before she blushes.

            &#147; I understand, hey we&#146;re here&#148; and with that Spin stops 
speaking.  She could barely think, in fact the only thing that came to 
mind was &#147;Damn.&#148;  She is awestruck by the large building she is 
looking upon.

            Tifa rings the doorbell and wakes Spin up.  The household 
maid, named Fuu, answers the door.  She lets them in and they wait in 
the living area.  

            After a minute Sakura and Tomoyo (or Madison) come down 
from the upstairs and enter the room to find Spin and Tifa playing 
Rock, Paper, Scissors.  Sakura clears her throat to get their 
attentions.  

            Sakura has her hair short and tied a little and is still 
wearing her PJs (and looks like she just got up) while Tomoyo is fully 
dressed in a dress and had her long black hair let down. Skaura and 
Tomoyo take a seat on one of the couches and ask for some tea.

            &#147;So, where is the guy&#148; Spin asks impatiently.

            &#147;He is up stairs,&#148; Tomoyo answers.  

            &#147;Why don&#146;t we go look at him?&#148; asks Spin.

            &#147;Fine lets go,&#148; Tomoyo stands and exiting. 

            Sakura and Tomoyo stop at a door.
