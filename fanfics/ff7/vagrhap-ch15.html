<h1>Vagrants Rhapsody (part 15 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/pnkpanther9.html">PnkPanther9</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff7/vagrhap-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>There in the dark, Tifa felt a loss of identity, her typical mask of 
daily living slipping from her visage and disappearing into the inky 
sea. She felt like a child, cold and vulnerable, the measured 
uncertainty slowing her steps some as she clumsily navigated along the 
dark forest floor. A few steps ahead of her, Yuffie led, her body a 
vague dark shape amidst the shadows of the trees. No moonlight seeped in 
through the canopy, and with each chilly breeze, the whispers of the 
forest floated hauntingly along the air.

Garbed in a thick sweater, the cold of the night managed even to pierce 
through the cotton weave, sending shivers up and down the woman&#39;s spine 
as she glowered at her friend&#39;s back. Yuffie had revealed nothing of her 
intentions when she had suddenly pulled alongside the road sometime ago, 
the outside of the forest looking as if it were an impenetrable wall of 
pitch-black darkness. She had simply wheeled the bike out of view of the 
road, hiding it behind a large gnarled tree. Then, with an arrogant 
smile at Tifa, she silently walked into the forest.

Though Tifa had tried numerous times to get some sort of answer as to 
where she was being led, the girl refused to give one, proving her 
stubbornness as well as her tenacity. So resigned, Tifa followed, feet 
tripping every so often on roots and hair occasionally catching on the 
gnarled, long-reaching branches of the trees. She didn&#39;t understand what 
it was that Yuffie wished to show her, here, in the middle of nowhere. 
It was dangerous to be wandering around like this. Creatures of all 
sorts lurked about the fields at night, and especially here, in the 
forest, there was no telling where an enemy may lie.

Gripping her arms tightly, Tifa stared with wide eyes at the gnarled 
faces of the trees, their bark twisting into grim smiles as she passed.

Body bumping into Yuffie, it was then that the fighter realized the girl 
had finally stopped.

The girl had turned slightly and even in the dark, the woman could make 
out a smile. &quot;The thing about nature is that it&#39;s really sneaky.&quot; She 
turned completely, arms crossing high on her chest. &quot;It sneaks up on 
you, it keeps things hidden. What people don&#39;t realize is that nature is 
always balanced. For every hideous thing, there is something beautiful. 
For every death, there is life. For every place of darkness, there is a 
place of light.&quot; She tilted her head to one side, hand reaching up to 
scratch the back of her head. &quot;Well, as you can see, this forest is 
pretty grim and spooky and all...but you wanna know what?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Tifa asked, shivering.

Yuffie took hold of Tifa&#39;s hand and began to lead her forward. The 
fighter held her breath as they carefully squeezed through a dense 
cluster of trees, their branches reaching down and serving to snag on 
their clothes as they went through. Squeezing her eyes shut, the woman 
reached a hand up to shield her face from the sharp clutches of the 
trees.

When they broke free, the branches snapping viciously as they pulled 
forward, Tifa lowered her hand, opening her eyes again. She couldn&#39;t 
help but gasp at what she saw.

A clearing wide and open lay before her, the moonlight showering down in 
a clear rain of translucent silver. The grass reached up to their knees, 
swaying with the wind as white flowers bobbed above the sea of 
cool-green. A small knoll rose in the center of the clearing, and there 
a young tree sprouted, its bark still pale and it&#39;s branches still 
scrawny and short. Still, it cast a long shadow against the rolling 
grass, the moonlight breaking through its branches in such a way that 
caused Tifa&#39;s heart to leap at the sight of it.

Taking a step forward, the woman let out a laugh of disbelief. &quot;Shiva!&quot; 
Whirling around, Tifa smiled wide, her eyes shining. &quot;Yuffie, this spot 
is amazing!&quot;

Yuffie, her face illuminated in the face of the moonlight, smirked. &quot;I 
found this place before I met you and the others. It reminded me of 
Wutai, so I&#39;d come here a lot.&quot; Yuffie shoved her hands into her back 
pockets and walked past Tifa towards the tree. Stopping so that the 
shadows of the branches streaked across her face, the girl tilted her 
head back and closed her eyes. &quot;There&#39;s something about this one spot 
that&#39;s special. It feels...It...It feels...&quot; she tilted her head 
forward, eyes gazing down at the ground. &quot;...It feels holy. That&#39;s how 
it feels.&quot;

Tifa nodded, eyes looking up at the stars with a serene smile. &quot;It&#39;s 
marvelous. Your so lucky to have found it.&quot;

Yuffie turned a quarter around, her eyes soft. &quot;I was afraid of showing 
this place to anyone. Like it would soil it or something. People have 
tendencies to do that...destroy stuff I mean. But I wanted to show this 
place to you Tifa. Because...&quot; the girl thought for a moment. Then 
without warning, she laughed. &quot;Gawd! Look at me!&quot; the girl laughed 
again, and Tifa gave her a puzzled look. Calming down, the ninja 
realized the woman wasn&#39;t laughing, and so nervously, she coughed out, 
&quot;It just...uh...it seemed natural to show you this place, Tifa. That&#39;s 
all.&quot;

&quot;Your nervous.&quot; Tifa said after a moment, a smile on her face as she 
shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t believe it. You&#39;re actually nervous!&quot;

The ninja glared at her. &quot;What&#39;re you talking about? I&#39;m not nervous!&quot; 
she returned huffily.

&quot;You are! You&#39;re all tense! I can tell from where I&#39;m standing!&quot; Tifa 
laughed, walking over.

&quot;Yuffie Kisaragi does not get nervous.&quot;

&quot;So are you afraid then?&quot;

Yuffie snorted, crossing her arms and turning away.

Tifa rolled her eyes to the sky, a soft smile on her lips. The woman 
supposed she should give the ninja some slack, and just take into 
consideration the fact that she was showing her something very special, 
after all.

Stepping forward, Tifa wrapped her arms around Yuffie&#39;s shoulders. 
Speaking softly into her ear, the fighter said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry...I didn&#39;t 
mean to tease you. It&#39;s just...&quot; she grinned and squeezed the ninja, 
&quot;You&#39;ve no reason to be nervous!&quot;

Pulling away, the woman watched the girl turn, a grumpy expression on 
her face. Laughing slightly, Tifa sat at the base of the small tree. 
Patting the ground next to her, she said, &quot;Come on, sit with me. Tell me 
everything that&#39;s on your mind. This place offers a kind of quiet and 
tranquility you can&#39;t find in many other places, and I want to take 
advantage of it.&quot;

Yuffie gazed down at her, her body standing rigid in the moonlight. Then 
after a moment, she sat down. For a moment neither said anything. Tifa, 
though she could probably think of a few things to say herself, decided 
to keep quiet. She wanted to hear what Yuffie&#39;s innermost thoughts were. 
Wanted to see what her opinions and aspirations all culminated to.

The woman could not decipher her sudden thirst for conversation and 
interaction. She felt as if she were a teenager again, there in the 
moonlight. Looking up at the stars, she recalled the cold breeze of Mt. 
Nibel, the passionate fight of a girl escaping from the suffocating 
embrace of childhood into the dangerous clutches of adulthood becoming 
alive once again in her heart. Her teenage years had not been easy...

&quot;You know, my mom once told me,&quot; Yuffie suddenly began, leaning forward. 
Tifa&#39;s eyes snapped onto her and she shook away her earlier thoughts. 
Licking her lips, the ninja continued. &quot;My mom once told me that when 
men spilled one another&#39;s blood, the gods above would cry, and their 
tears would fall into the sky and stay there. That&#39;s where our stars are 
supposed to come from.&quot;

She looked at Tifa with a smile. &quot;How many tissue boxes do you think 
they went through because of me?&quot;

At first Tifa stared at her, surprised at her sudden show of humor. Then 
she laughed and gave the girl a slight shove. &quot;I bet they&#39;ve got an 
entire galaxy of stars because of you.&quot; The woman said jestingly.

The girl chuckled and looked down at her lap. Then the smile faded from 
her face and she sighed. &quot;How many people do you think we hurt? As 
Avalanche?&quot;

Tifa&#39;s smile faltered and she looked down at her hands. &quot;I&#39;m...not 
really sure.&quot;

&quot;Looking back on it...is there anything you regret?&quot; Yuffie asked, 
turning to the woman.

The fighter leaned back against the tree, her eyes looking up through 
the branches at the sky. &quot;Anything I regret?&quot; the woman thought for a 
moment. Then she slowly nodded. &quot;There are plenty of things I regret.&quot;

&quot;Like what?&quot; Yuffie asked, leaning back as well.

&quot;I regret...&quot; Tifa closed her eyes. Taking a deep breath, she began. &quot;I 
regret not telling Cloud the truth about what had happened back at 
Nibelheim, and following along with his false memory when I knew it was 
wrong. I regret hurting the people I did back in Midgar. Barret and me 
were rash in blowing up those reactors. We destroyed hundreds of lives 
and didn&#39;t even know it. I regret...I regret not being able to stop 
Aeris&#39; death that night at the Ancient City, when Sephiroth ran her 
through with his sword.&quot; Tifa grabbed a fistful of grass, her throat 
beginning to tighten. Yuffie watched her silently, a soft frown on her 
face as Tifa continued. &quot;I regret that Marlene and Elmyra were 
kidnapped, and we could do nothing to save them, not even Reeve. I 
regret that I never told Aeris how great a friend she was to have. I 
regret never telling Cloud how I felt about him...how...how special he 
was to me...And I regret wrecking Cid&#39;s Tiny Bronco, when we tried 
stealing it to get to the Temple of Ancients.&quot; Tifa laughed, tears 
rolling down her face and dripping onto her sweater. Wiping them away, 
she said with meek honesty, &quot;I really think that was my fault. I had no 
idea what I was doing, trying to fly that plane!&quot;

Yuffie laughed slightly, her face breaking into a smile. &quot;I remember 
that! When I saw you guys crash into the water, I thought my heart was 
going to stop!&quot;

The two laughed together, Tifa sniffling every now and then as she wiped 
the last of her tears away.

&quot;You wanna know what I regret?&quot; Yuffie said leaning over onto Tifa&#39;s 
shoulder and snuggling closer.

&quot;What?&quot; Tifa asked quietly as she laid her head against Yuffie&#39;s.

&quot;I regret stealing your materia the day we arrived at Wutai on Cid&#39;s 
plane.&quot; The girl reached over and grabbed Tifa&#39;s hand, interlacing her 
fingers with Tifa&#39;s as she continued on quietly, &quot;I regret not being 
nicer to Aeris when I first met her. I regret thinking of only money and 
materia and my own well being when I first started traveling with you 
all. I regret being so young and stupid when the situations we were in 
called for someone mature and intelligent. I regret...&quot; the girl began 
to chuckle. &quot;I regret vomiting all over Cid&#39;s airship the first day we 
rode it. I regret spilling orange juice all over Vincent&#39;s cape. And I 
especially regret kicking a soccer ball into Nanaki&#39;s head back in Costa 
del Sol, because honestly, I completely forgot I even did that!&quot;

Tifa threw her head back and laughed, Yuffie giggling as she buried her 
face in the woman&#39;s shoulder.

When they both calmed again, the girl sighed. &quot;But you wanna know 
something else I regret, Tifa?&quot;

Tifa turned her head slightly. &quot;Hmm? What&#39;s that?&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s eyes grew soft and she gave the woman&#39;s hand a tender squeeze. 
&quot;I regret not getting to know you sooner.&quot;

Tifa lifted her head, looking down at the girl with a wide-eyed look. 
Her reaction was not so much inspired by what the girl said, but more 
how she said it. Gaze flickering toward their hands grasped together, 
the woman felt her heart begin to freeze with fear and the insecurities 
that had been plaguing her as of late began to creep from the shadows of 
her mind. But when the ninja sighed again, the sound brought warmth to 
Tifa&#39;s heart, and she chased away her fears.

If only for that one night, she didn&#39;t want to be scared of anything.

Reaching over with her other hand, Tifa placed it over Yuffie&#39;s and 
squeezed. Nuzzling the girl&#39;s hair, the woman whispered. &quot;Yeah...I 
regret not knowing you sooner too.&quot;

There they sat, beneath the young tree and the open night sky, the 
moonlight raining down on their heads and the trees surrounding them 
making a chorus of hushed voices. Tifa didn&#39;t want to move from where 
she was. Her senses were filled with the sweet scent of vanilla, and 
before her eyes, she could see with blurred vision, the dancing bulbs of 
the long stemmed flowers, still swaying above the reaches of the grass.

The moments stretched on. And then...

&quot;Should we be going?&quot; Yuffie breathed.

Tifa closed her eyes. &quot;Let&#39;s stay a little longer.&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s getting late.&quot;

&quot;Please, just a little longer...&quot;

&quot;...Okay.&quot;

The girl moved her legs so that they stretched alongside Tifa&#39;s. Tucking 
her head beneath the woman&#39;s neck, Yuffie breathed, &quot;It isn&#39;t so cold.&quot;

&quot;Body heat.&quot; Tifa muttered, feeling drowsy.

Yuffie quirked an eyebrow and smirked. &quot;Sounds dirty.&quot; She said.

Tifa made a disgusted noise, but a smile was on her lips. &quot;You&#39;re so 
vulgar.&quot;

The ninja grinned. &quot;&#39;Vulgarity is my charity. Sincerity is my clarity.&#39;&quot;

Tifa cracked her eyes open, her eyebrows rising. &quot;Um...what?&quot;

Yuffie chuckled. &quot;Never mind...it&#39;s from a song.&quot;

The fighter rolled her eyes. &quot;Guilly again?&quot;

&quot;Yep. Guilly.&quot;

&quot;Ugh...he&#39;s god awful. I don&#39;t know why you like him.&quot;

Yuffie shrugged, smiling sleepily. &quot;He&#39;s fun. What&#39;s wrong with fun?&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;ve got nothing against fun, myself. But listening to his music, 
I feel like I&#39;m in the diminutive.&quot;

&quot;...In the what?&quot;

&quot;I mean listening to his stuff makes me feel like I&#39;m small and 
idiotic.&quot;

&quot;Oh...&quot; the girl shifted slightly. &quot;But you didn&#39;t seem to mind him so 
much before when Meteor was singing one of his songs.&quot;

Tifa frowned. &quot;Meteor?&quot; She blinked, and then her eyes brightened. &quot;Oh! 
The band from the crafts festival! Yeah well,&quot; the woman shrugged one 
shoulder, &quot;The difference was that they were singing the song. Not him.&quot;

&quot;So you dislike Guilly? Not his music?&quot;

&quot;I guess so.&quot;

A pause.

&quot;...That&#39;s really messed up, Rusty.&quot;

----------

She could hear the rustling of leaves and smell the scent of dirt and 
bark. Warmth rained down on her face, and the woman smiled pleasantly, 
her mind rising from its deep slumber.

Eyes beginning to ease open, Tifa wondered just where she was, when her 
chocolate brown eyes met cerulean ones. But what really frightened the 
woman, was that these eyes...

...Weren&#39;t human.

Neck craning down so that it could gaze closely into her face, a 
full-grown chocobo with long, powerful legs and clawed feet, gave a low 
warble as it tilted its head in curiosity.

Eyes widening in terror, Tifa&#39;s body tensed, and she shook Yuffie&#39;s 
shoulder frantically. The girl in question had not moved from her 
position since last night, and so when she jerked her head up, she 
knocked Tifa&#39;s jaw in the process, causing the fighter to bite her 
tongue.

&quot;Wha-?&quot; The girl rubbed her eye. &quot;...Whatizzit?&quot; she mumbled.

Tifa didn&#39;t answer. Her eyes were watering from the pain blossoming 
across her tongue, and she let out a small whimper as she raised a hand 
to her mouth.

Yuffie turned to give her a confused frown, but then she froze at the 
sight of the chocobo staring at her, it&#39;s neck still craning downward so 
that it was eye level with them both. &quot;Uh...&quot; the ninja allowed her eyes 
to flicker around her, and she realized with a start that there were 
others.

At least five other chocobos stood in the clearing. Their yellow 
feathers blinded the girl as the sun came shining down. Four of the 
chocobos were full-grown and stared at her and Tifa with intense gazes 
that made her skin crawl. Hiding behind one of the chocobos long legs 
was a chicobo, which peeked meekly at the two girls with bashful 
curiosity.

&quot;Relax, Tifa.&quot; Yuffie said, placing a hand on her friend&#39;s shoulder. 
Slowly getting to her feet, she said, &quot;I guess we just fell asleep in 
one of their resting spots. If we&#39;re slow and careful, they won&#39;t attack 
us.&quot; The ninja held up her hands and began to carefully sidle past the 
chocobo in front of them, smiling nervously. &quot;Good, birdie! I won&#39;t hurt 
you!&quot;

Tifa stood and mimicked her, her tongue still throbbing with pain. The 
chocobo with cerulean eyes straightened, watching the two girls move 
away slowly with a blank stare.

&quot;Yuffie,&quot; Tifa hissed as they both carefully moved toward the other 
chocobos, hands still held up. The mother chocobo took a step back as 
they approached, warbling lowly. The chicobo chirped and stepped out 
from behind its mother&#39;s legs, head raised in interest. &quot;Yuffie!&quot; Tifa 
hissed again as they passed the mother and her baby.

&quot;What?&quot; Yuffie hissed back, her face still carrying a fixed smile. 
&quot;We&#39;re almost in the clear!&quot;

&quot;The chicobo,&quot; Tifa hissed. They were nearly to the trees now. &quot;The 
chicobo, its-&quot;

Without warning, the small bird leapt forward, giving an excited wark. 
Tifa and Yuffie screamed and turned, running full speed into the dense 
trees surrounding the clearing. The branches scratched and pulled, but 
their determination to escape was greater than the strength of the trees 
limbs. Breaking free of the branches, the two girls ran clumsily through 
the dark of the forest, back toward the road.

----------

&quot;Well that was unusual. Chocobos normally avoid humans!&quot;

&quot;Those tree branches wrecked my sweater. Look, I&#39;ve got scratches all 
down my arms!&quot;

&quot;Aw...I&#39;m sorry, Rusty. You shouldn&#39;t worry too much about that sweater 
though. We&#39;re heading to Costa del Sol, now. That place is always 
sweltering hot.&quot;

&quot;Still...I liked that sweater.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll buy you a new one. Promise. We&#39;re going to go shopping anyhow. 
Without that sweater you&#39;ll just have more room to put your new stuff.&quot;

They were sitting at a gas station, Tifa leaning against a concrete 
column while Yuffie refueled the motorbike. The sun was now almost 
overhead and the signature heat of the Costa del Sol coast was becoming 
a reality. Wearing a white tank top and faded jeans, Tifa fanned 
herself, her long hair pulled up into a messy ponytail. Yuffie hummed 
and tapped her foot, her thumb hooked into the pocket of her slim 
boot-cut jeans. After a moment, she grabbed the front of her gray 
t-shirt, the front of it showing a print of a moogle&#39;s face, and fanned 
it. &quot;Boy it&#39;s starting to get hot really fast!&quot; she exclaimed.

Tifa nodded mutely. Leaning her head back, she sighed. The concrete felt 
cool...

Yuffie the pulled the gas nozzle out of the motorbike and replaced it 
onto the pump. Waving to the man sitting in the building, she sat on the 
bike. &quot;All right, Tif. It&#39;s time to go.&quot;

Tifa pushed off the concrete column and walked over, grabbing her 
helmet. As she strapped it on, she asked, &quot;So how far is Costa del Sol 
from here?&quot;

Yuffie shrugged, putting on her own helmet. &quot;I think it&#39;s about an hour 
or two away...why?&quot;

Tifa smiled as she took her place behind Yuffie. &quot;There&#39;s this 
restaurant called &#39;Serino&#39;s&#39;. If you&#39;re not too tired when we get 
there...you wanna get a bite to eat?&quot;

Yuffie turned to look back at her, her eyes shining. &quot;Are you kidding? 
I&#39;d love to!&quot;

Tifa nodded, grinning as she wrapped her arms around her friend&#39;s waist. 
&quot;All right then!&quot;

A large smile on her face, Yuffie started up the bike, and pulling out 
of the station, the two continued their journey.
