Sometimes, when one person is missing, the whole world seems 
depopulated.
Lamartine

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The crunch of bone was unmistakable. Fingers sought purchase but found 
nothing, slipping on the grate floor and leaving bloody smears behind in 
long trails, evidence of her passing, reminders that she was once there. 
Before she could sail over the edge into forever and down to the ground 
to join the final sleep, her back hit the safety rails installed to 
prevent such accidents from happening.

Blurry figures fought back and forth, whipping swords and nightsticks, 
the ting of bullets hitting the air and she lay there dully, watching it 
all. The bomb attached to the console flashed the LCD numbers one after 
another and in her mind she placed a tick-tick-tick noise to it. She 
felt like screaming and venting her frustration.

She&#39;d trained so long and she was lying here, paralysed and useless, 
just watching them beat away at each other like demented puppets on show 
for a delighted audience with a mental age of ten and under. Her dark 
hair fanned out, almost escaping the tied bobble she used to rein it in. 
Shakily, Tifa put her hands on the floor and tried to ignore the vicious 
sting of the magic and her own torn muscles. She had to get up and she 
had to get to her feet, otherwise all she would have done is laid there, 
broken. Useless.

She wobbled a bit, uncertainly, hair falling in the front of her face as 
sweat rolled down her cheeks. Insults were being exchanged in the air 
about her, but only the dull &#145;tick, tick, tick&#39; of the clock in her 
heart kept on going, kept on pushing and striving. Hadn&#39;t she once sworn 
to be a master of the open palm? Hadn&#39;t Tifa Lockhart sworn she&#39;d never 
be just someone second rate, easily pushed aside and forgotten about by 
everyone else?

Hadn&#39;t she sworn her own vengeance in blood?

&quot;...It&#39;s time,&quot; rasped Reno, clutching his side.

She snapped her gaze up, looking to where the Turk staggered back. His 
unkempt shirt hung out and his clothes were torn on the knees of his 
regulation trousers and jacket arms. His hair, which was the colour of 
blood itself, was coming free about his glasses pushed up stylishly, and 
even the red tattoos on his face were strained with the effort of 
standing. Blood dripped from where his hand was pressed to his side.

She froze, staring at the wound.

...Sephiroth did this to you...didn&#39;t he?

Then the Turk was turning, running away in a skelter fashion, hither and 
thither and down the long stairs, leaving only crimson patches as a 
reminder that he had been there. Barrett wafted his gun arm about then 
grinned cockily, setting it to his shoulder as Cloud tried to shake off 
the effects of the paralysis pyramid technique Reno had used on them.

Tifa got to her feet and ignored those two who seemed to have forgotten 
their priorities and with a stagger no less stable than the Turks had 
been, she made it to the monitor and the LCD bomb, pressing fingers as 
quickly as she cold to the keys on the open board.

Please, someone stop this!

She pressed and searched the databanks, hurriedly looking for an 
uninstaller or rejected passcode that would open up the files needed to 
stall the bomb. But there was nothing, not a thing there to show her how 
to disarm it, her torn fingertips leaving smears on the keypad as she 
typed, getting slower with frustration with every passing minute clocked 
off by the numbers, luridly green. In a fit of temper she kicked the 
underside of the control panel and turned to Cloud, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to 
stop this, try it!&quot;

He came to her shoulder and she backed off, clenching her fists as he 
went through almost the exact same routines as she had not moments 
before. But there was nothing and the mercenary shook his head and 
turned around, &quot;This is no ordinary bomb.&quot;

Great &#150; no shit Sherlock. Give that man half a brain cell...

She bit her tongue and squeezed her eyes shut as they all three stood in 
momentary silence trying to take it all in. She&#39;d pinned her hopes on 
his training, that something may have stuck in his memory from any of 
that and once again, her heart had taken a bruising blow. Tifa bit her 
lip too, feeling blood spring up from the pressure she applied 
helplessly.

&quot;I&#39;m such a failure,&quot; she whispered breathlessly to herself.

Then Barrett heard it first, turning with a growled curse as was 
expected from the giant&#39;s lips more often than not. She opened her 
wine-dark eyes and glanced to where Barrett was looking in expectation. 
There, a helicopter was coming closer with the snicking whirring sound 
of the blades passing through the air, keeping it aloft in the all the 
madness that raged helplessly on the lower echelons of the pillar. Tifa 
ran to the railing at Barrett&#39;s side to stare, Cloud drawing up behind 
her with that familiar presence. &quot;...what...?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; a calm voice told them and she clamped a hand on her 
long hair to keep it from whipping up in the backdraft of the 
helicopter. The speaker was a man in his thirties with a smooth, unlined 
face bar a couple of sad looking laughter lines that stretched from his 
dark eyes. His hair was long, to his shoulders at least and in the 
centre of his forehead was a red dot. His clothes however, mirrored 
those that Reno had worn in such a tousled fashion and his very air was 
commanding and firm. She was briefly reminded in a sad way of her old 
master, Zangan. He&#39;d possessed the same calm authority that this Turk 
did. The stab of pain to her heart went unnoticed in the midst of the 
other tangled feelings. &quot;You&#39;ll have a hard time disarming that one. 
It&#39;ll go off the second some jerk touches it.&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; she screamed over the noise of the helicopter, &quot;Stop it!&quot;

&quot;...Only a ShinRa executive can set up or disarm the emergency plate 
release system...&quot; he made an amused gesture, as if to point out that he 
wasn&#39;t capable of it. Tifa ground her teeth so hard that tears sprang to 
her eyes.

Beside her, Barrett roared into indignation, &quot;Shut yer hole!&quot; and moved 
the arm around to fire on the helicopter. She and Cloud raised their 
arms wordlessly to prevent the scattering of the blistering cases that 
sang, hitting the grating and falling away into the aching drop below 
them.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that,&quot; said the man, his voice somehow carrying, &quot;You 
might just make me injure my special guest...&quot;

Tifa frowned as he reached back and drew forward the struggling form in 
a pink dress and red jacket, the golden brown hair messed up beyond 
recognition with the familiar pink ribbon skewed in amongst the hair. 
&quot;Aerith!&quot; she screamed.

&quot;Oh, you know each other?&quot; He smiled, &quot;How nice you could see each other 
one last time, you should thank me.&quot;

Cloud finally found his voice, just as she was shoving past Barrett&#39;s 
restraining arm, getting free to run towards the helicopter without a 
second thought. &quot;What are you going to do with Aerith!&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t decided. Our orders were to find and capture the last 
remaining Ancient. It&#39;s taken a long time...&quot;

She didn&#39;t hear the words just then, tucking them away for later as she 
got a foot onto the rail and stretched to try and grasp at Aerith&#39;s 
hands which were locked about the floor of the moving helicopter. 
&quot;Aerith,&quot; she gasped softly.

Green eyes locked with her, shining with defiance and hope, &quot;Don&#39;t 
worry, Tifa, she&#39;s all right!&quot;

Tseng frowned and reached over, tugging the flower girl upright by her 
jacket shoulder and with a hand that held a device in it, slapped her 
smartly across the cheek. To Tifa, the girl took a horribly long time to 
fall into the helicopter and lie there still, showing only the soles of 
her boots. &quot;Aerith!&quot; she cried angrily and tried reaching for the 
platform just as Tseng&#39;s foot came into contact with her ruined fingers 
and pressed hard. Swallowing a yelp, her body betrayed her and let go.

She came to a stop on the grate and glared up at Tseng, mentally marking 
the Turk down on her list of people to kill at some point, the little 
&#145;Black List&#39; she called it. He smirked at her and then with a renewed 
back-draft, the helicopter flew off. Above them came the sounds of 
joists creaking and strong junctions giving way. Helpless, she stood and 
angrily watched them go.

She would have stood there for longer perhaps, shocked to her core. How 
could anyone raise a hand to someone like Aerith, who had put up so 
little fight, only said a few words.

...ShinRa... I hate them all...

&quot;I hate them all,&quot; Tifa whispered, forming fists with her hands, 
ignoring the blood dripping to the grate. The pain felt good, it 
reminded her she was still alive, it reminded her that she still had 
much to do yet.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Cloud offered quietly, but she pretended she hadn&#39;t heard 
him.

Instead, it was his touch on the arm that alerted her to Barrett 
swinging a large wire and hook about, yelling something about them 
escaping via it. She came over dully and hitched herself up onto his 
shoulder, the ruined hand cradled against his chest. She hoped 
everything would be all right with Marlene really, and with an aching 
swing, they flew off into the forever as the world that had been her 
home for five years crushed everything underneath it as it fell down...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Aerith sat here earlier...

She rubbed her hand, the cure spell having worked as well as she could 
have managed it, but the resentful voice inside told her Aerith could 
have done it better. Tifa was sat atop the very same slide that Aerith 
had positioned herself on only a day or so before this had all happened, 
staring not at the pile of ruins that was now sector 7, but at her own 
hand and the torn material that just about covered it.

Cloud was crouched by the unconscious Barrett, waiting for him to wake 
up with the curative materia clasped loosely in his hand. The green glow 
was vibrant, painting a sickly light across the two men. She didn&#39;t want 
to watch the wounds the large miner had sustained be healed; instead she 
pursed her full lips and stared at her hand, stared at it and cursed 
bitterly.

Everything keeps slipping through my fingers. Why am I so useless? Why 
can&#39;t I hang onto anything at all. Friends, family, my home... they all 
just vanish like smoke, into the thin air and I never hear of them 
again. Vanished like the dreams of yesterday.

I know you won&#39;t blame me for this ever, but what a failure I am to 
myself. I have failed myself too many times... and even now, even when 
he falls over and asks questions, I lie and lie and lie, until I should 
turn to dust from it.

I lie, most of all to myself.

&quot;He&#39;s waking up,&quot; Cloud advised as he drew back and she looked up, 
grateful to see the hulking bear of a man shaking himself awake. 
Stockily built and tall, he was as dark skinned as the Canyon people 
were, with a reckless grin and countless scars across his weary body; a 
fearsome exterior hiding a gruff sense of justice and duty, even love.

Since that time she had crawled her way to Midgar and collapsed, Barrett 
had taken care of her like the wayward younger sister he never had. He 
helped her build the bar from a dream of wanting to be around people 
again, he&#39;d tried to keep her safe from harm without actually once ever 
stopping her from doing as she wished. Even Marlene treated her like a 
sister, or a young aunt. She owed him more than simple thanks. When she 
had wept hollow tears and screeched out her anger, her horrible, violent 
temper, he&#39;d been there to help her pick the pieces up and put them back 
together slowly. He&#39;d patiently waited until she was well enough to see 
that some things simply happened... and that life wasn&#39;t all about 
grief.

Losing him would be unbearable, she decided.

&quot;Marlene,&quot; he said, putting a groggy hand to his head, then he leapt up, 
&quot;Marlene!&quot; His eyes travelled to the ruins of the doors and the glowing 
inferno of death beyond that, then they widened. She winced, and held 
her chest, touching the bumpy scar the sword had left down her otherwise 
flawless skin. &quot;Biggs, Wedge, Jessie!&quot; he hurried over, calling out 
their names, &quot;Marlene!&quot;

&quot;Barrett...&quot; She said softly, watching him.

&quot;...&quot; he fired at the door, then kicked... then wearily punched at it 
and sank to the dusty floor, holding his face in his hand, &quot;Goddammit... 
god...dammit... to hell... what&#39;s it all for?&quot;

&quot;Hey, Barrett&quot; Cloud tried to put his hand on his shoulder, but the 
large man shook him off, and went at the smouldering mess again, fists 
flailing. Surprised, the Soldier took a step back and glancing in 
uncertainty to her, and she sighed, slipping from the slide to go and 
join him.

&quot;Argh!&quot;

&quot;Barrett, stop!&quot; She grabbed one of the flailing arms and yanked him 
back, foot behind his so he was jerked from his centre of balance, 
&quot;Please stop.&quot;

&quot;...Marlene...&quot; he sobbed.

&quot;I...think Marlene is safe.&quot;

&quot;...huh?&quot; Those brown eyes stared at her in confusion.

Tifa dropped his arm so he stumbled away from her. She placed both of 
her arms about her middle and looked down with pain hidden in her eyes, 
&quot;Right before they took Aerith, she said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, she&#39;s all 
right.&quot; She was probably talking about Marlene...&quot;

&quot;R...Really...?&quot;

&quot;But...&quot;

There was a silence and Barrett looked down, &quot;Biggs, Wedge, Jessie.&quot;

&quot;All three of them,&quot; Cloud added quietly, looking for once, not so 
distant, but sad, &quot;they were in the pillar.&quot;

&quot;Think I don&#39;t know that?&quot; Barrett snapped and then shook his head in 
apology, moving so his hand grasped the nametags that swung over his 
chest, then continued in a somewhat more despondent tone of voice, 
&quot;But... we... all of fought together. I don&#39;t want to think of them as 
dead...&quot;

&quot;...and the other people in sector 7,&quot; Tifa nodded.

...the old man who&#39;d tell me stories about his time spent in Wutai.

The twins who joked relentlessly about my cooking.

Even Johnny, when he found time to write, all those letters are gone now 
too...

&quot;This is all screwed up, they destroyed an entire sector to get to us! 
They killed so many people!&quot;

She narrowed her eyes and looked at Barrett sharply. &quot;Are you saying 
it&#39;s our fault? Because Avalanche was here? Innocent lives were lost 
because of us?&quot;

He stared at her then gave a strangled sob, reaching to take her 
shoulder with his good hand &#150; it was heavy and real, this was reality, 
she reminded herself. &quot;No, Tifa... that ain&#39;t it! Hell no! It ain&#39;t us, 
it&#39;s the damn ShinRa. It ain&#39;t never been nobody but the damn ShinRa. 
They&#39;re evil and they&#39;re destroying our planet just to... build their 
power and line their own damn pockets with gold! If we don&#39;t get rid of 
them, they&#39;re gonna kill this planet. Our fight ain&#39;t ever over until we 
get rid of them.&quot;

She looked him right in the eyes, fighting the surge of bitter emotions. 
It was their fight. Their, we, us, our. He was right, fundamentally so. 
She&#39;d sworn in blood to see this through until the end, no matter what 
the cost might turn out to be and she nodded at him. He was right. He 
was more right than she would ever be with her wishy washy convictions, 
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she confessed finally.

&quot;What don&#39;t you know, you don&#39;t believe me?&quot;

&quot;No... I&#39;m not sure... about me. About my feelings.&quot;

&quot;...&quot; he looked from her to Cloud and she let out the breath of air she 
hadn&#39;t realised she was holding in. &quot;...an&#39; what about you?&quot;

&quot;...&quot; there was only a silence from Cloud who had, at some point in 
their exchange, presented his back to them, a back at which she frowned. 
Then suddenly he ran off and she blinked. Why was he running away?

Barrett looked no less surprised, looking at Tifa and waiting for some 
kind of explanation as to why the mercenary was acting even more 
strangely than normal. She placed her hands together then blinked and 
touched her forehead: she really must have hit her head!

&quot;Oh, Aerith!&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah, that girl, what&#39;s up with her?&quot;

Tifa scowled. Nothing is up with her, she felt like yelling, nothing at 
all. She&#39;s perfect. &quot;...she&#39;s the one I left Marlene with.&quot;

&quot;Damn, Marlene!&quot; Barrett hurried after Cloud and she sighed, following 
him in a wordless jog into the ramshackle of sector 5, &quot;Tifa, there 
ain&#39;t no turning back now.&quot;

&quot;There never was,&quot; she said quietly to herself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Aerith&#39;s house was just as Tifa had pictured it.

In her childhood she had spent much time wandering the mountains of 
Nibelheim, looking at the flowers but never before had she seen such 
beautiful flora as the ones that exploded into bloom in the packed dirt 
around the small house. The house itself looked as if it had simply been 
stolen from a fairytale, rare sunshine flowing through some chink in the 
plate to bathe it and the scent of home cooking wafting through the 
window of the kitchen that opened onto the garden beyond it. Cloud 
knocked at the door, then entered at the good natured voice of the woman 
from inside.

They all filed in carefully, Tifa vaguely annoyed that neither male even 
bothered to stop and wipe their feet on the pretty doormat that read, 
&#145;welcome!&#39; with flowery designs. Inside, the home was neat and 
cottage-like, with flowers in vases and expansive dining table greeting 
them, the kitchen just off to the side and if she hazarded a guess, the 
living room to the back where the radio softly played away to itself.

The woman who greeted them was maybe five feet tall if she tried to 
stand up straight, with hair that was now more grey than brown and kind 
eyes, webbed with traces of the years in the scattered wrinkles of good 
humour that characterised the face of Aerith&#39;s mother. They had a round 
of introductions and she shook hands with her, smiling gently.

&quot;Cloud, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; Elmyra said finally, turning to the blond, &quot;It&#39;s 
about Aerith, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, the ShinRa have her.&quot;

If Tifa had expected horror or fright, she was severely disappointed, as 
were the others; for the aging woman simply sighed regretfully and sat 
down, wiping her hands on the apron she wore. &quot;I know, they took her 
from here.&quot;

&quot;They were here!&quot;

&quot;It was what Aerith wanted,&quot; she replied simply.

Tifa didn&#39;t ask, she sat down with a horrified thump, staring at Elmyra. 
Her hands tightened, a flash of pain reminding her that the bruise from 
her own inept healing still remained on the palm of her left hand.

Cloud looked at her and she avoided his gaze, feeling incredibly guilty 
all of a sudden, then he asked Aerith&#39;s mother bluntly, &quot;Why do the 
ShinRa want her?&quot;

&quot;Because, Aerith is an Ancient, the sole survivor.&quot;

&quot;...what did you say? Aren&#39;t you her mother?&quot; Barrett blinked and Tifa 
drew her dark eyes up to look at the woman, feeling the prickle of 
tears.

&quot;...not...her real mother,&quot; there was pain there in the voice, pain in 
the eyes that looked away, as if through the wall to the garden. Tifa 
fancied that the mother were trying to envisage her daughter, running, 
laughing, tending those flowers gently, the life she cherished and 
helped protect and grow. &quot;Oh, it must have been... 15 years ago. During 
the war,&quot; she smiled. The war, there had only been one war to be named 
so, the war of the west upon the eastern military power of Wutai when 
their two cultures had come into conflict; the nature loving Wutai had 
eventually broken under the force of the science that ShinRa forced on 
them. &quot;My husband was sent to the front, some far away placed named 
Wutai.&quot;

Her voice became wistful, and Tifa tried to picture the scene as she 
spoke. &quot;One day, I went to the station because I got a letter saying my 
husband was coming home on leave. My husband, he never came back...&quot;

Elmyra sighed, &quot;I wonder if something happened to him? No, I&#39;m sure his 
leave was just cancelled. I went to the station every day... then one 
day... there was a woman and her child laid on the station steps with 
the attendant hovering by helplessly. The woman wasn&#39;t old looking, only 
about late twenties, early thirties at most with pale golden brown hair 
and the saddest smile I&#39;d ever seen. The child was a young girl, perhaps 
five or so. She was the image of the young woman, beautiful... you used 
to see this sort of thing a lot during the war. Her last words were, 
&#145;please, take Aerith somewhere safe.&#39;&quot;

Tifa covered her mouth trying so hard not to cry, her own sympathy 
screwed to fever pitch. &quot;My husband never came back and I had no child, 
so I was probably lonely. So I decided to take her home with me. Aerith 
and I became close very quickly &#150; that child loved to talk!&quot;

The martial artist hid a sudden smile &#150; what little time she&#39;d spent 
with Aerith had proven interesting and also somewhat exhausting. She 
really did have a talent for talking to people about anything and 
everything, making it all sound interesting. Elmyra continued;

&quot;She used to talk to me about everything. She told me, she had escaped 
from some sort of research laboratory somewhere, and that her mother had 
already returned to the planet so she wasn&#39;t lonely and many other 
things...&quot;

&quot;Returned to the Planet?&quot; Barrett interrupted.

Tifa took this chance to dash tears from her eyes, trying to fix her 
cool composed mask into place. Aerith had always been smiling, why 
didn&#39;t she let it show, that fear? It must have been so horrible, must 
still be so... there was no doubt in Tifa&#39;s mind that the laboratory was 
run by ShinRa. She added another tick on the &#145;Black List&#39; next to 
&#145;things to do to the science department&#39;.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know what she meant, I asked her if she meant a star in the 
sky. She said no, this planet. She was a mysterious child in many 
ways... Once she came to me and told me not to cry, that I shouldn&#39;t be 
sad. Someone I loved had died, his spirit had been trying to see me, but 
he&#39;d already returned to the planet. I was shocked and confused, but 
sure enough, several days later we received a notice saying my husband 
had died.&quot; Elmyra crinkled her eyes with a sad smile, the smile someone 
wears when the raw tears of grief leave only sadness behind, &quot;And that&#39;s 
how it was. A lot had happened, but we were happy... until one day...&quot;

&quot;One day...?&quot; Cloud prompted.

&quot;...A man from the Turks came to see us. It seems he knew Aerith from 
her time spent in captivity. He said his name was Tseng, and unlike the 
bullies they can be, he never once laid a finger on her, only spoke to 
her. He told us that she was born of special blood, that Aerith could 
lead everyone from the slums to somewhere special, a place called the 
&#145;Promised Land&#39;. It would be a place of prosperity and happiness. She 
denied it all of course, hearing voices, her unique powers... but I knew 
the truth. I knew all about her mysterious powers.&quot; Elmyra laughed 
softly, so sadly; it made Tifa want to weep all the harder, &quot;she 
tried... so... so hard to hide it, so... I acted as though I never 
noticed...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s amazing how she&#39;s managed to avoid ShinRa all this time,&quot; Cloud 
said in a measure of awe and wariness.

The woman looked from face to face, Tifa tried smiling but it felt 
wobbly and out of place. &quot;The ShinRa needed her, so I guess they 
wouldn&#39;t harm her.&quot;

&quot;But,&quot; Tifa asked, the memory of the blow to Aerith&#39;s face still strong 
in her mind, the long fall and then the stillness after it, &quot;Why now?&quot;

&quot;She brought a little girl with her. On the way, Tseng probably found 
them and Aerith, being how she is, offered to let them take her away in 
exchange for the little girls safety.&quot;

&quot;Must be Marlene,&quot; offered the mercenary and winced as Barrett burst in 
over it;

&quot;Marlene! Aerith was caught because of Marlene... I&#39;m sorry... Marlene 
is my daughter...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re her father?&quot; Elmyra frowned and stood up, and even Barrett 
paused in waving his arms about to take a step back. Tifa was briefly 
glad a table existed between herself and the two parents. &quot;How in the 
world could you ever leave a child alone like that?&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; he begged brokenly, &quot;don&#39;t start with that. I think about it 
all the time, what would happen if I... but you gotta understand 
somethin&#39;. I don&#39;t got an answer... I wanna be with Marlene but I gotta 
fight, cause if I don&#39;t, the planets gonna die. So I&#39;m gonna keep 
fighting! But then, I&#39;m worried &#145;bout Marlene...I really just wanna 
spend time with her... see, I&#39;m going round in circles now...&quot;

&quot;I think I understand what you&#39;re saying. She&#39;s upstairs, the first 
room, you should go see her.&quot;

Barrett grinned and moved past, up the stairs with a clattering noise 
and cry of his daughters name. Cloud followed after, scrubbing 
sheepishly at his hair as he went. Tifa drew symbols on the lace 
tablecloth with the patterns of wings embroidered carefully on the hems 
and edges. She knew that Elmyra&#39;s eyes were on her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said softly, &quot;this is my fault.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t think that, Aerith doesn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;...how do you know that?&quot; Tifa looked up sullenly, &quot;Everyone always 
blames someone else.&quot;

Elmyra just smiled at her, motherly. A stab of grief tore her heart, how 
she wished she could recall if her mother had ever smiled like that. 
&quot;Aerith never blamed anyone for anything. She&#39;d say, it was just one of 
those things that happen. That if she kept smiling, then tomorrow would 
come sooner and brighter than today or yesterday. It&#39;s a good 
philosophy. Don&#39;t get me wrong, she&#39;s nobodies fool, and neither is she 
an airhead optimist... she just knows that you can&#39;t go around carrying 
grief like a burden and anger like a battering ram.&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;ll bring her back,&quot; she said.

&quot;I think you will.&quot;

&quot;...&quot; Tifa looked down, &quot;I really am sorry though.&quot;

Cloud came down the stairs, followed by Barrett and she stood up, 
looking past Elmyra and setting her face stubbornly. Let&#39;s see him try 
and order me around now, she thought defiantly.

&quot;Cloud,&quot; she said, noting that he&#39;d tried walking past her without so 
much as saying a damned word, how insufferable could one man be! &quot;You&#39;re 
going after her, right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m coming with you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s ShinRa headquarters, you gotta be prepared for the worst.&quot;

&quot;I know!&quot; she snapped and looked away, sullen, temper grating at her 
nerves. &quot;I know,&quot; she repeated, &quot;Right now... I feel as though I have to 
push myself to the limit... or... or I&#39;ll go crazy.&quot;

Crazy because I&#39;m such a mess. All I ever do is make mistakes...

She didn&#39;t hear much else, stepping outside ahead of them to take one 
last look at the flower garden which had been tended with careful hands, 
and a smile which bloomed no matter how little sunshine there was. An 
Ancient? Did that really matter anyway?

Aerith was a person, was someone who was fast becoming something dear to 
her. The simple words and gestures, the gifts given and the support for 
a heart she had thought too scarred to beat any longer, someone who had 
stopped the clock from turning over. She didn&#39;t want this to end here 
with something unavoidable, with another mess she made and couldn&#39;t get 
out of.

Tifa lifted her hand and frowned at the yellow orb as they said their 
goodbyes inside to Elmyra. It shone brightly.

&quot;...people always throw away useful things...&quot;

&quot;...we&#39;ll see about that,&quot; she muttered as the door opened and closed 
behind her, and the mutter of, &quot;where to now,&quot; drifted over. With a 
sigh, she turned away from the vision of flowers and heaven, to more 
mundane, tiring and soul scarring matters...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

She curled her arms about her knees and tried not to chatter her teeth 
with the old fear, faces pressed to the glass of the tank outside. She 
knew them and their faces. The Turks whom she&#39;d had spent a lifelong 
rivalry with; Reno and his jokes, Rude and his taciturn silence and 
Tseng, who watched her with sympathy.

Over the years, despite them having orders to bring her in, they&#39;d also 
become a strange family. Reno had sometimes seen her when off duty &#150; 
when she&#39;d tensed to run, he&#39;d wave a hand and proclaim, &quot;It&#39;s my time 
off, kitten, don&#39;t sweat it.&quot; And would tell her jokes. Rude, too, took 
this attitude and bought flowers if he saw her on his time off. She grew 
to know their routines...

But Tseng had been lucky in finding her.

The compassionate young man of her youth stared at her lovingly and 
sorrowfully, unable to do anything else and stuck between what is and 
what he&#39;d like.

She didn&#39;t blame him, she told him.

...but the faces blurred as they left, so only one face remained, 
leering and greasy, with lank hair framing a thin face and sneering 
lips, oversized glasses and lab coat. She shivered and pressed further 
away from him, as best she could.

...and bit her lips hard, blood running down her chin, so she would not 
cry out...

...she&#39;d never cry out again...</pre>
