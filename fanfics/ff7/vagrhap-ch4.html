&quot;...My ceiling?  Why my ceiling?&quot;

&quot;So that on the weekends, when you come back from a long night of 
drinking and partying, you can crash out on the floor, stare up, and see 
a bunch of pretty colors and things...that&#39;d be cool.&quot;

&quot;...Would I be getting high during these outings of mine?&quot;

&quot;Nah, ceiling art can only be appreciated when drunk...not high.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;d know this, how?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t.  It was just a thought.  Why?  Did you think it was a bad 
idea?&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s not so much that, it&#39;s just...I never go out partying.&quot;

&quot;I can tell.&quot;

&quot;Have you gone to a lot of parties before?&quot;

&quot;To be honest...no...not really.&quot;

Exhausted and sitting on the couch, both Tifa and Yuffie had their heads 
tilted back and were staring at the ceiling.  It was now nighttime, and 
the two had just returned from the festival.  Neither seemed to have the 
energy to get up.

Yuffie tapped her chin.  &quot;You should paint Shiva and Siren on your 
ceiling.&quot;

Tifa frowned slightly.  &quot;Why?&quot;

At this, the other girl smiled lazily.  &quot;Cuz&#39; their pretty.&quot;

The fighter lifted her head to stare at her.  &quot;Yuffie, I think you need 
to go to bed.&quot;

The ninja rubbed at her eye.  &quot;I think I do...&quot; Yawning, the girl tried 
to get up, but failed.  &quot;Tif, help me.  I don&#39;t have enough energy.  I 
think my limbs are dead.&quot; She whined.

Sighing, Tifa pushed herself onto her feet.  &quot;Come on, drama queen.  
It&#39;s time for bed.&quot;

Yuffie took her hand, and the woman helped her to her feet.  &quot;Thanks,&quot; 
she said as she teetered a bit.  Shuffling towards her room, the girl 
stifled another yawn, &quot;Night, Tif.&quot;

Tifa smiled after her.  &quot;Night, Yuffie.&quot;

The ensuing silence after the ninja&#39;s departure left the fighter feeling 
like a passive thought of shallow origin.  Not too long before, she had 
been making a connection with a friend, reliving a memory of celebration 
and joy she had long since forgotten.  But now, she was back in neutral, 
lost without the helping hand of a shinobi who knew more about life and 
the fire that came with it than perhaps she did.  After all, Tifa had 
received many winding blows throughout her lifetime...many of them 
experienced during the year she spent traveling with Avalanche.

Idly, the woman wondered where her true discontent lay.  Was it in her 
current situation?  Or was it in her past somewhere, lying unseen?

Trudging into the kitchen, Tifa was about to make her way to her bedroom 
when the door to the garage called her attention.  Turning slowly to it, 
she gazed at it with cold eyes, not wishing to once again drown herself 
in a hopeless endeavor, an endeavor that, though she may not admit it 
consciously, was really a project of deeper meaning.

&quot;Not tonight.  You&#39;re not going to torment me tonight...&quot; the woman 
muttered, continuing her path to her room.

About to enter her room, Tifa was once again struck by the fact that she 
was actually going to sleep in her bed.  &quot;This is a record.&quot; The woman 
thought wryly.

Fingers grasping the cool metal of the bedroom doorknob, she was just 
about to open the door when&#151;

&quot;OH.  MY.  GAWD!!&quot;

Tifa jerked, head snapping in the direction of Yuffie&#39;s room.  Hurrying 
to the door, she burst into the bedroom, flicking on the light and 
glancing around wildly.  &quot;What?  What is it??&quot;

&quot;S-Spider!  On me!  Oh Leviathan, I can feel it!!&quot; Yuffie was standing 
on her bed and reaching at her back.  &quot;Crap!  It&#39;s going down my 
frickin&#39; spine!&quot;

Tifa held up her hands, &quot;Yuffie, relax!  You&#39;ll smash it and that&#39;ll 
just be disgusting!&quot;

&quot;God damn it Tifa, you dunno how frickin&#39; BIG this&#151;HOLY&#151;&quot; Yuffie yelped 
and fanned her shirt.  &quot;It&#39;s in between my breasts!  Get it out!  Get it 
out!  Ugh!!&quot;

&quot;Quit it, or it&#39;ll bite you!&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot;

Burying her face in her hands the woman shouted, &quot;Stop jiggling around!  
You&#39;re just exacerbating the situation!&quot;  Tifa moved to the side of the 
bed, gesturing for Yuffie to come down.  &quot;C&#39;mere, and don&#39;t jerk.&quot;

Yuffie whimpered as she carefully climbed off the bed, now as stiff as a 
statue and looking terribly frightened.  &quot;Tif...Tif, get it off, it&#39;s 
crawling up to my neck!&quot;

Sure enough, the spider crawled out from beneath the shirts neckline.  
It was a dark spider, not large, but thick.  Tifa was relieved to see it 
didn&#39;t have any of the marks of a poisonous spider, and reaching up, she 
carefully brushed the arachnid into her open palm.

&quot;There.&quot; Tifa said, cupping the spider.  &quot;No need for panic.&quot;

Yuffie rubbed her neck vigorously, &quot;Easy for you to say...it wasn&#39;t 
crawling all over your skin!&quot;

Smirking, Tifa turned to leave the room, &quot;Night, Yuffie.&quot;

&quot;Hey, Tif?&quot;

The woman stopped and turned.  &quot;Yes?&quot;

The ninja gave her a sheepish smile.  &quot;Thanks.&quot;

Tifa nodded.  &quot;No problem.&quot;

Shutting the door, the fighter went into her room.  There, she opened 
her window and placed the spider on the windowsill.  It scuttled out 
into the shadows of the night.  Tifa waved softly for a moment before 
shutting her window and changing her clothes.  Feeling exhausted, the 
woman finally went to bed.

-----

The next morning, Tifa awoke to hear noises coming from her kitchen.  
Frowning groggily, the woman kicked the blankets off of her and left her 
room.  Entering the kitchen, she squinted at the light.

&quot;Good morning, Rusty.&quot;

Blinking, Tifa&#39;s eyes adjusted enough to the light to see that Yuffie 
was already setting food out onto the table.  &quot;I made breakfast, hope ya 
don&#39;t mind.&quot;

&quot;Oh no!&quot; Tifa said, smiling pleasantly.  &quot;I&#39;m surprised.  This was nice 
of you.&quot;

Yuffie grinned.  &quot;I saw that you had tofu, green onion, and seaweed and 
I was jes&#39; like, &#39;Wow!  I can actually cook something with this stuff!&#39;  
So I did.&quot; She waved a hand.  &quot;This, Tifa, is what we eat for breakfast 
in Wutai!  White rice, miso soup, and sausage.&quot;

The fighter nodded, eyeing the food with approval and admiration.  &quot;This 
looks really good.  You have to teach me how to make this!&quot;

Yuffie blinked as she sat down.  &quot;Wow, I never thought I&#39;d hear that.  
Tifa Lockhart, asking me to teach her how to cook something?&quot; she served 
a bowl of miso soup and handed it carefully to Tifa.  &quot;It&#39;s easy enough 
to make this stuff.  Nothing complicated...or else I wouldn&#39;t have been 
able to make it.  Did I tell you of the time I burned a tub of ice 
cream?&quot;

Tifa paused as she was just about to begin eating.  Thinking the 
sentence over again, she wrinkled her nose.  &quot;How in the world do you 
burn ice cream?&quot;

Yuffie smiled proudly.  &quot;No idea!  But I managed it!&quot;

&quot;Nothing&#39;s impossible for The Great Ninja Yuffie I suppose...&quot; Tifa said 
jokingly.

&quot;Hardy, har, har.  Very funny, Tif.&quot;

&quot;I should do stand up comedy.  Things may not have always been the 
easiest in my life, but I can think of a few moments that would earn 
some laughs from a crowd.&quot;

&quot;Like what?&quot;

&quot;Like the first time we arrived at Costa del Sol.  Red XIII was about 
ready to pass out from the heat.&quot;

Yuffie laughed.  &quot;I remember!  He did end up passing out.&quot;

&quot;He passed out only because you hit him in the head with that soccer 
ball.&quot;

The ninja blinked, a sausage held to her lips.  &quot;I...did?&quot;

Tifa looked at her incredulously.  &quot;Yes!  And then you ran off and we 
couldn&#39;t find you for the longest time!  When we finally did, you were 
hiding out in that man&#39;s materia shop!  Don&#39;t you remember?&quot;

Yuffie frowned.  &quot;Materia shop...?  ...Oh.&quot; A slow grin spread across 
her lips.  &quot;I remember now.&quot;

Tifa rolled her eyes.  &quot;Yeah, I bet you do...&quot; she grumbled.

-----

&quot;Tif, why are you living here in Tiesmire?  I mean...out of all places 
you could&#39;ve moved to, why this place?  Couldn&#39;t you have moved to 
Rocket Town?  It&#39;s not far from here.&quot;

&quot;I would&#39;ve, but...somehow, the thought of running into Cid and Shera 
didn&#39;t settle well with me.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s weird...being friends with a couple...a family no less, and being 
single with no children.  You can understand that, can&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;I guess so...&quot; a pause.  &quot;Yeah.  Yeah, I can understand that.&quot;

Tifa and Yuffie were sitting in the living room.  It was around noon by 
now.  With nothing to do and nothing of interest nearby to see, the two 
settled for simply lounging on Tifa&#39;s couch and watching television.  
However, they were growing more and more absorbed in their conversation 
than what the TV had to offer:  A game show in which the contestants 
were putting rubber bands around their heads and trying to answer trivia 
questions at the same time.

Disgusted with the sight of people degrading themselves for cash, Tifa 
turned the television off.  &quot;Yuffie, if you don&#39;t mind my asking...why 
did you leave Wutai?&quot;

Yuffie shrugged.  &quot;I already told you.&quot;

&quot;Yes...but...what did your father do to you that made you angry enough 
to leave?&quot;

The girl snorted, crossing her arms.  &quot;He was being a chauvinistic 
bastard, like always.  A real grade a asshole if you ask me.&quot;

&quot;He told you to do something you didn&#39;t want to do?&quot;

&quot;He basically told me to give up my future.&quot;

&quot;...How&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;Tifa, can we talk about something else?  Thinking about my dad gets me 
in a pissy mood.&quot;

Tifa looked at her for a moment before nodding.  &quot;All right...&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s talk about you,&quot; Yuffie said, turning fully to Tifa.  Curling up 
on the couch, the girl gave the fighter a shrewd look.  &quot;When you&#39;re 
through with that truck o&#39; yours, what&#39;re you gonna do?  Are you gonna 
just sit here and wait for something to happen to you?&quot;

Tifa frowned deeply.  &quot;I haven&#39;t thought about that...&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you just take the truck to a garage or something?  They&#39;d be 
able to fix it.  I still think you should just take it to Cid.&quot;

&quot;Yuffie, I don&#39;t think you understand.  Fixing that truck is just 
something I have to do on my own.&quot;

&quot;No offense, Tif.  But by the sound of your voice, you know as well as I 
do that you&#39;ll never fix that truck.&quot;

Tifa didn&#39;t say anything.  She chose to stare at the blank television 
screen instead.

&quot;Rusty.&quot;

The woman didn&#39;t answer.

&quot;Rusty, let&#39;s spar.&quot;

Head snapping toward her companion, Tifa stared at Yuffie as if she were 
crazy.  The ninja shrugged plaintively.  &quot;What?  We&#39;ve got nothing else 
to do and we both could use the practice...well.  You do.&quot;

Tifa shook her head.  &quot;No way.  We could hurt each other.&quot;

&quot;Oh come on!  We both have pent up frustrations that we could use 
getting rid of.  What&#39;s the harm in a bit of sparring between friends?&quot;

Tifa frowned.  &quot;But Yuffie, we don&#39;t have any sparring gear.  We don&#39;t 
even really have a place TO spar!&quot;

&quot;Your front lawn.&quot; The girl said, jerking her head toward the front 
door.  &quot;We can spar there just fine.&quot;

Tifa stared at her incredulously.  &quot;Are you insane!?  The neighbors&#151;&quot;

&quot;Won&#39;t say a thing unless they want my fist in their mouths.&quot; Yuffie 
stood.  &quot;Come on, Tif.  Quit being so worried all the time.&quot;

&quot;Yuffie-&quot;

&quot;Tifa, if you don&#39;t spar me now, I&#39;ll take it as your yielding to me as 
the better martial artist.&quot;  The ninja said this with a smirk, placing 
her hands high on her hips in her trademark pose.

At this, the woman stood, eyebrow slowly rising as she did so.  &quot;Oh 
really?&quot; pursing her lips, Tifa brushed past the girl.  &quot;Get your shoes 
on, we&#39;re gonna spar.&quot;

Grinning, Yuffie stared after her.  &quot;That was so easy...&quot; she said, grin 
widening.

Ten minutes later, the two were standing on Tifa&#39;s lawn, ten paces apart 
from one another.  After a moment was spent staring each other down, 
Tifa spoke.  &quot;If we&#39;re gonna do this, we&#39;re going to follow the general 
rules of street sparring.  Are you familiar with those?&quot;

Yuffie smirked.  &quot;Sure.  How do you think I practiced my ninjitsu?&quot; the 
girl held up her hand and began to tick off her fingers.  &quot;First rule:  
all target areas allowed.  Second rule:  the match is called only when 
one person clearly and audibly forfeits, or loses consciousness.  Third 
rule:  No grappling.  Fourth rule:  no use of weapons or objects is 
allowed unless agreed upon by both contenders.&quot;

Tifa nodded, impressed.  &quot;Very good.  So no weapons.&quot;

&quot;And, basically, discretion and moderation is up to the fighter.&quot; Yuffie 
added, bowing.

Tifa returned the bow before falling back to her fighting stance.  She 
smirked slightly, though her stomach clenched at the look on her 
companion&#39;s face.  &quot;Exactly...so I guess we&#39;ll just have to trust each 
other not to get carried away, right?&quot;

Yuffie fell into her fighting stance, a manic grin on her face.  
&quot;Right,&quot; she said, her eyes glinting.  The expression she wore was the 
same look she wore whenever she was about to enter combat.  An intense, 
and confident look that Tifa had seen often on the girl&#39;s face on more 
than one occasion.  To be honest...the look frightened the fighter.

Swallowing, Tifa immediately began to regret agreeing to a sparring 
match with Yuffie.  The ninja had completely manipulated her this time.  
The woman supposed she really was rusty.

The two moved toward each other, stopping within arms reach as they 
began to cycle around.  Once.  Twice.

Yuffie switched her feet a few times rapidly, laughing as Tifa jerked 
back as the girl did so.  Gritting her teeth, the fighter watched her 
opponent carefully, thinking over and over in her head, &quot;Attack me.  
Attack me.  Attack me!&quot;

Yuffie as if hearing the woman&#39;s thoughts, snapped a sudden punch toward 
her torso.  Tifa, startled, blocked the punch.  Yuffie sent another fast 
punch towards the woman&#39;s throat.  The fighter knocked the punch away 
with the same hand she blocked with before.  The ninja, following up, 
shot a chop towards her opponent&#39;s temple.  Alarmed, Tifa blocked with 
both of her hands.

At this move, Yuffie smiled devilishly, snapping a sharp kick to Tifa&#39;s 
exposed side.  The force of the blow sent the fighter to the ground, 
some wind rushing from her lungs.  The ninja lifted her left leg in the 
air, and brought her heel down in a rush of wind.  &quot;Kyah!&quot; the girl 
cried, just as Tifa dodged the attack.  Pushing herself up to her knees, 
the fighter looked up in time to see Yuffie&#39;s foot coming toward her 
face in a low roundhouse kick.  Blocking it, the woman hopped to her 
feet, turning to the side as another punch from the ninja glanced off 
her shoulder.  Grabbing her opponent&#39;s arm, Tifa reached with the other 
hand and grabbed the back of Yuffie&#39;s neck, sticking her leg out as she 
aided the girl&#39;s momentum and sent her flying to the ground.  &quot;What 
the-!?&quot;

Not wanting the opportunity to pass, Tifa lifted her leg and brought it 
down in a powerful stomp only to miss as Yuffie rolled out of the way 
and up into a kneeling position.  There she lunged forward with one leg, 
pressing her palms together and spearing Tifa in the gut with her hands.  
The fighter, letting out a hiss, stumbled back a few steps.

&quot;Your pretty good for someone who&#39;s rusty.&quot;  Yuffie said tauntingly as 
she straightened.  She rotated her shoulders and turned so that her 
right foot was toward Tifa.  Hopping back and forth, Yuffie moved her 
hands in a motion not unlike boxers before a fight truly began.  &quot;But 
you know, I&#39;ve got the speed and confidence of someone who still knows 
what its like to be in a fight.  Do you remember that, Tif?  The 
adrenaline rush you get when it&#39;s just you and the other person?&quot;

Tifa tried to focus more on Yuffie&#39;s movements than what she was saying.  
The ninja was trying to distract her, trying to psyche her out...but 
regardless of Tifa&#39;s knowledge of this, she found it hard to 
concentrate.

&quot;Come on Tif!&quot;  Yuffie snapped a few punches into the air and smirked.  
&quot;I&#39;m the Greased Lightning!  Even if you anticipate an attack from me, 
are you even gonna be quick enough to block it?  Cuz&#39; you can&#39;t avoid 
it, I&#39;ll tell you that much.&quot;

Tifa&#39;s mind drifted to a cool forest, the wind rustling the leaves and 
the sun shining through the leaves, painting the forest floor in a pale 
green light.  Standing before her was not nineteen-year-old Yuffie, but 
rather, her past self, when she was only sixteen.  A smudge of dirt was 
on her nose, and her hair was messy and tangled from days of negligence.  
Wearing the same predatory look she wore now, the Yuffie then was just 
as fierce and fiery in battle.  Tifa recalled how raw her movements had 
been then.  As a martial artist still sharp in her practice, the woman 
could nit pick at all the little things Yuffie did that left her 
exposed, that caused her just that much more time to recover after 
delivering an attack.  But now...now she couldn&#39;t.  She had stopped 
training, and was now dull in her senses.  Yuffie, however, had 
improved.  That was as much as Tifa could tell.

What she really should have been noticing, however, was the fact that 
Yuffie had now come closer, inching some to the side.  &quot;Tifa, how do you 
move with those breasts of yours anyway?  I&#39;d imagine they&#39;d come flying 
up to knock you out or something...why don&#39;t you try and attack me with 
them?  I&#39;m sure they could bludgeon a person to death.&quot;

Tifa grew red in the face.  Why&#39;d Yuffie always have to-?

&quot;Kyah!&quot;  Yuffie kicked out with her left leg in a swift and powerful 
roundhouse towards Tifa&#39;s trunk.  Tifa blocked the attack, her mind 
still on what Yuffie had just said, and so when she looked up to see 
Yuffie&#39;s hand flying toward her neck in a chop, the fighter didn&#39;t react 
quickly enough to block.

The blow connected, and Tifa gasped, coughing as her hand flew to her 
throat.  Yuffie withdrew, pausing slightly in the face of Tifa&#39;s 
coughing fit.  But the fighter straightened her back, falling into a 
fighting stance once again.

Yuffie raised an eyebrow at her.  &quot;Sure you don&#39;t wanna yield?&quot;

Tifa shook her head, a fierce scowl on her face now.

Yuffie smirked,  &quot;Okay then!&quot;

The girl rushed forward, throwing a wild punch towards her opponent&#39;s 
head.  Bewildered, Tifa knocked the punch away, sending one of her own 
towards the ninja&#39;s rib cage.  Yuffie blocked that as well, snapping a 
punch towards the fighter&#39;s throat.  The punch was blocked and what 
followed could only be described as a quick and confusing series of 
attacks, blocks, and reversals.  Panting, the two opponents somehow 
managed to lock arms, faces inches away from each other.  Gazes fierce 
from the throes of combat, they stared for a moment into each other&#39;s 
eyes before pushing the other away and falling back into their 
respective stances.

This time, it was Tifa who attacked first, sending a straight kick to 
Yuffie&#39;s head.  The ninja dodged the attack, sailing a roundhouse 
towards the woman&#39;s knee in retaliation.  The attack was blocked and 
Yuffie followed up immediately with another roundhouse toward the 
woman&#39;s side.  Blocked.  Another follow up, this-time a roundhouse to 
the woman&#39;s head.

Tifa, instead of just blocking the attack, grabbed the ninja&#39;s ankle, 
and, using her size to her advantage, pushed Yuffie to the ground with a 
strong shove.  The ninja fell with a loud &quot;Umph!&quot; and Tifa attempted to 
follow up the counter attack with swift blow from the heel of her palm 
to the ninja&#39;s sternum.  Yuffie, anticipating that move, grabbed the 
fighter&#39;s arm and pulled her down, planting a foot in the woman&#39;s 
stomach and sending her sailing over her head, where the fighter crashed 
to the ground, head lying near Yuffie&#39;s.

Panting, neither of the two stood.

&quot;Y-Yuffie...&quot; Tifa wheezed, wincing at the sores suffered from earlier.

&quot;Y-Yeah, Tif?&quot;  Yuffie huffed back, her hair matted to her forehead with 
sweat.

&quot;Let&#39;s call it a tie, m&#39;kay?&quot;

&quot;...O-okay.  That sounds good.&quot;

They still didn&#39;t get up.

The few neighbors who had been watching retreated back into their homes 
as soon as they saw the fight was over.  &quot;That was one hell of a 
sight...&quot; one man muttered, a beer can clutched in his hairy fist.  He 
grinned lecherously.

Yuffie wiped at her forehead as she stared up at the sky.  &quot;I don&#39;t 
think I wanna move.  The clouds look so pretty.&quot;

Tifa looked at them more closely.  Pointing she said, &quot;There&#39;s a 
chocobo.&quot;

Yuffie tilted her head some so that she could see where Tifa was 
pointing.  A lazy smile spreading across her face, the ninja nodded.  
&quot;That&#39;s neat.&quot;

They fell silent, their breathing turning low and rhythmic.  Their 
chests rose and fell in sync, and Tifa closed her eyes after a moment.  
She felt as if she could sleep right there on the lawn...

&quot;That was a good match, Tifa.&quot;  Yuffie said after a moment, her voice 
quiet.

&quot;Mmm...&quot; Tifa mumbled, her eyes still closed.

&quot;Is your neck okay?&quot;

&quot;A bit sore, but nothing serious.&quot;

&quot;For a moment I was afraid I really hurt you.&quot;

&quot;Well all targets were allowed, Yuffie.  I&#39;m not upset with you if 
that&#39;s what you&#39;re really worried about...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know...it&#39;s just...&quot; the girl paused, licking her lips.  &quot;When 
you&#39;re sparring with a person that you know personally...you don&#39;t get 
that anxiety you feel when fighting a stranger.  My dad and I used to 
spar all the time...that is, until me and him started having arguments 
all the time.  ...It was nice sparring with you, Tifa.  I hadn&#39;t sparred 
with anyone in a really long time.  I forgot how it felt...that trust 
and connection, y&#39;know?  It&#39;s a great feeling.  We have to do it again 
sometime.&quot;  Yuffie placed her hands behind her head and crossed her 
ankles.  &quot;If only everyone in the world solved their disagreements with 
one good spar.  Y&#39;know.  Slugged the hell out of one another, but never 
to the point that it grew too serious.  It&#39;d get rid of the pent up 
anger and resentment.  I know people who have become best friends after 
giving each other black eyes.  It&#39;s like war veterans I guess.  When you 
experience battle with one another and live to tell about it, you form 
this bond.  You can&#39;t recreate that anywhere else.  It&#39;s special.  
Y&#39;know?&quot;

Tifa didn&#39;t say anything.  Yuffie blinked and tilted her head back to 
stare at the top of the fighter&#39;s head.  &quot;Tif?&quot;  she pushed herself up 
into a sitting position and stared down at the woman.  Her mouth 
dropped.

&quot;I don&#39;t believe it!&quot; she breathed incredulously.  &quot;She fell asleep!&quot;

-----

A silly thing...waking up.  You were just on the line between 
consciousness and sleep, dreams and outrageous realities made true by a 
fuzzy haze of transition.  The angel in your dream, with her creamy skin 
and wispy hair, offset by the rosy background of an evening sky, 
appeared to you as vivid as it did in your dream world.  In fact, the 
angel was almost recognizable, with her large, bright eyes and cocky 
grin.

...Wait, what?

Tifa&#39;s eyes fluttered.  &quot;...Y-Yuffie?&quot;

Yuffie was staring down at her with an amused expression on her face, 
her hair blowing into her eyes with the cool evening breeze.  &quot;Morning, 
Rusty.&quot;

Tifa frowned and sat up slowly, groaning at the stiffness in her neck 
and back.  Rubbing her neck, she stared around her in shock.  &quot;I fell 
asleep on my front lawn??&quot;

&quot;Yep.&quot;

Tifa turned to glare at her.  &quot;Why didn&#39;t you wake me up!?&quot; she cried.

Yuffie shrugged innocently.  &quot;I didn&#39;t wanna disturb you!  You seemed 
comfortable there on the grass...&quot;

&quot;Oh my god!  My skin!  It itches!&quot;

Yuffie chuckled nervously.  &quot;Heh...sorry, Tif.  I just...I couldn&#39;t 
bring myself to do it.  You look so cute when you&#39;re sleeping.&quot;

Scratching at her back, Tifa gave the ninja a disturbed look.  &quot;You 
watched me sleep??&quot;

&quot;I had to make sure a bug didn&#39;t crawl up your nose!&quot;

Standing, Tifa picked the grass from her hair.  &quot;Yeah?  Well you 
could&#39;ve just woken me up!&quot;

Tifa stormed back into her house, Yuffie quickly following her.

&quot;Y&#39;know, you talk in your sleep?&quot;

&quot;So?&quot;

&quot;You kept muttering something about an angel.&quot;

Tifa swallowed, her cheeks turning a light pink.  &quot;I was just having a 
dream...&quot; the woman mumbled, flopping onto the couch and picking more 
grass blades from her hair.

Yuffie flopped down next to her.  &quot;Sounded like you were having a really 
nice one...what was it about?&quot;

&quot;Did you eat, yet?&quot; Tifa asked, attempting to change the subject.

&quot;Yeah, I made a sandwich...made you one too.  It&#39;s in the fridge.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Tifa said as she stood and went into the kitchen.  Opening the 
refrigerator, she took the sandwich out and sat herself at the table.  
Yuffie stared at her from where she sat.  &quot;Tifa, you&#39;re acting a bit 
weird.&quot;

&quot;Well I did just wake up in my front yard.&quot; The woman snapped, biting 
fiercely into her sandwich.

&quot;Geez, Tifa...Look, I&#39;m really sorry I just let you sleep there.  Next 
time you look peaceful and like you&#39;re getting some much needed rest 
I&#39;ll be sure to bother you.&quot;  The ninja crossed her arms and glared down 
at her shoes with a loud, &quot;Humph!&quot;

Tifa rolled her eyes with a sigh.  Swallowing her bite of sandwich, she 
said, &quot;Yuffie, you&#39;re intentions were sweet...if a little creepy.  But 
you can&#39;t deny, it was a bit ridiculous.  How long did I sleep there?&quot;

&quot;Three hours.&quot; Yuffie said, still not looking up from her shoes.  But 
she wasn&#39;t frowning anymore.

Setting down her sandwich, Tifa scratched at her arms, &quot;I&#39;ve gotta go 
take a shower...this itching is gonna drive me insane.&quot;

Standing, she left Yuffie alone in the living room.  Moving into the 
bathroom, Tifa locked the door.  There she began to undress, her head 
still buzzing with her disbelief.  &quot;I can&#39;t believe she just let me lie 
there...&quot; the woman muttered, stepping into the shower.  She shook her 
head as she turned on the water.

When she was through, the fighter grabbed a towel from the rack and tied 
it around herself, tossing her clothes into the hamper before leaving 
the bathroom and moving down the hall to her bedroom.  There she changed 
into her pajamas.  As she pulled her shirt over her head, she heard 
Yuffie enter her room.  Tifa pulled her hair out of her shirt with a 
sigh.

Leaving her room, she stopped at Yuffie&#39;s door, considering going in.  
But realizing she didn&#39;t know what to say, the fighter continued walking 
past, her shoulders slumped in dejection.

Taking a hair clip from the bathroom, the woman clipped her damp hair up 
into a messy bun, moving slowly into her kitchen.  Picking up the 
sandwich, she took another bite, chewing the food slowly.

It didn&#39;t take long before her eyes drifted toward the garage door.

&quot;Tifa.&quot;

Tifa jerked slightly and turned to see Yuffie standing behind her.  The 
ninja had her arms loosely crossed.  &quot;I...I think I&#39;m gonna be leaving 
tomorrow.&quot; She said quietly.

The fighter blinked.  &quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Yuffie rubbed the back of her left leg with her right foot.  
&quot;I only meant to come visit you.  I don&#39;t want to be a bother.&quot;

&quot;Yuffie, you haven&#39;t been a bother to me at all.  In fact...&quot; Tifa 
smiled genuinely, &quot;This is the most fun I&#39;ve had in a long 
time...spending time with you.&quot;

At this, Yuffie&#39;s eyes brightened.  &quot;Really?&quot;

Tifa nodded mutely.

The fighter sat herself at the table, taking another bite of her 
sandwich.  Yuffie sat in the chair next to her, biting her lip.  &quot;Tifa.&quot;

Tifa looked to her.  Swallowing her bite, she asked, &quot;What is it?&quot;

Yuffie stared down at her hands.  &quot;What...what&#39;re you gonna do after I 
leave?&quot;

Tifa blinked.  &quot;I...dunno.&quot;

&quot;Are you gonna keep working on that truck of yours?&quot;

&quot;...I guess so.&quot;

Yuffie nodded, biting her lip again.

Tifa, swallowing down another bite, looked at the girl with concern.  
&quot;Yuffie, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;I want you to come with me.&quot;

The silence that followed these words was so thick, Tifa was sure she 
could feel it pressing down on her.  &quot;...You...you want me to...go with 
you?&quot;

Yuffie recoiled at the woman&#39;s words, and Tifa quickly corrected 
herself.  &quot;Not to say that I don&#39;t want to spend time with you!  I like 
you a lot, Yuffie!  It&#39;s just...that&#39;s a big thing to ask.&quot;

The ninja shrugged meekly.  &quot;I dunno...I just...It&#39;s been fun, hanging 
out with you, and it gets lonely on the road, y&#39;know?  Plus I...don&#39;t 
really like the idea of leaving you alone here...just so you could 
continue tinkering with that stupid truck.&quot;

&quot;The truck isn&#39;t stupid, Yuffie.&quot;

&quot;That thing&#39;s a hopeless case, Tifa.  You have to admit it.  You have 
to.&quot;

Tifa didn&#39;t say anything.  She chose to take another bite of her 
sandwich.  Yuffie sighed and stood slowly, laying her palms on the 
table.  &quot;The offer still stands, Tif.  It&#39;ll be fun.  We&#39;ll see all the 
new stuff that&#39;s been built, and visit some of the old places too.  
We&#39;ll even stop to see the others.  I&#39;ll be leaving later sometime 
tomorrow so...&quot; the girl coughed.  &quot;Uh, yeah...G&#39;night Tif.&quot;

Tifa muttered a &#39;good night&#39; in return as the girl walked away, not to 
be seen for the rest of the night.

Finishing her sandwich, the fighter wiped the crumbs from her lips and 
from her clothes.  She stood and began walking toward her bedroom, but 
stopped as she glanced over at the garage door.  Looking from the hall 
to the door and back, Tifa chose the latter to move to, her breathing 
sharp and shallow.

Opening the door slowly, the hinges squeaked as she pushed it open all 
the way.  A silhouette in the doorway from one world to another, the 
woman lifted a slow hand and flicked on the light.

The truck seemed to glare at her, it&#39;s weathered face asking the silent 
question, &quot;Where the hell have you been all this time!?&quot;

&quot;Away...&quot; the woman breathed, moving towards it.

&quot;And what have you been doing while you were away?&quot;

&quot;Remembering how to live.&quot;

The truck had no response to this, so Tifa pulled a stool from near the 
side table and sat herself before it.  Her face a shadowy visage, the 
woman glared down at the hood of the truck as if it were the cause of 
all her troubles.  &quot;Yuffie&#39;s right.  I don&#39;t know why I keep bothering.&quot;

The truck had an answer to this, and it gave it readily.  &quot;Imagine what 
a dream I&#39;d be, running smoothly down the street with my body gleaming 
from a new coat of paint.  Wouldn&#39;t that be nice?  And it would be all 
your doing.&quot;

&quot;No amount of skill and hard work can change you.&quot; The woman said, her 
voice hollow.

&quot;Now who told you that?  It&#39;d make you feel better, wouldn&#39;t it?  
Knowing that you accomplished what you had set out to do?  You aren&#39;t a 
quitter, now are you?&quot;

&quot;This isn&#39;t a matter of quitting, it&#146;s a matter of realizing a truth.&quot;

&quot;And the truth is whatever you choose it to be.&quot;

Tifa blinked, her eyes spacing out.  &quot;...Your right.  The truth is 
whatever I choose it to be...&quot;

The fighter didn&#39;t move from where she sat.
