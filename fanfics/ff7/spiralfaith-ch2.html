    &#147;Well, I don&#146;t really know, all I know is we can&#146;t disconnect him 
without permission from a guardian.&#148;

        &#147;Then what will we do, he is a vegetable who won&#146;t wake up?&#148;

        &#147;We wait.&#148;  

    ------------------------------------------------------------
May 6(Three days after Tifa&#146;s Birthday) 
Early Sunday Morning (May Sixth):  Tifa and Yuffie&#146;s Bedroom:

            &#147;Okay, the teacher and principle forgive you and you won&#146;t 
have detention next year&#148; Tifa says setting her car keys on a table 
(She just got back from the school).

            &#147;Thank you Miss Guardian&#148; Yuffie says as she gets into 
bed, &#147;now let me say sorry in my own way.&#148;

            &#147;No,&#148; Tifa says sternly pulling out a Science book, &#147;Now 
we study for the only exam you have to take.&#148;

            Yuffie pulls Tifa into bed (with the book), &#147;But I don&#146;t 
wanna study.&#148;  &#147;We could have more fun doing what I want,&#148; She 
snickers, but it doesn&#146;t sway Tifa.  &#147;Fine, but after words we&#146;re 
gonna play.&#148;  &#147;Okay I am Ready.&#148;

Dreamers Mall: Ice Rink:

         &#147;Hey, lets go&#148; Spin says pulling Amber out on the ice. &#147;Heh, 
this is gonna be fun.&#148;  

            Spin loves to ice skate, and is very good; Amber on the 
other hand fell flat on her ass every time.  

            &#147;Ow, that hurt,&#148; Amber, whines rubbing her rump. &#147;You know 
you said that I would get better,&#148; She says grasping onto Spin before 
she fell again.

            Spin just laughs and starts to skate backwards-pulling 
Amber with her. &#147;There you&#146;re doin it.&#148;

            &#147;Only cuz&#146; you&#146;re holding me up&#148; Amber whines again. &#147;Hey 
stop!&#148; Amber commands pointing behind Spin.  They both stop and Spin 
looks behind her, standing there is the man at the Diaoudji&#146;s.  He is 
on the ice and moving towards them.

            &#147;Hello Spin&#148; He says as he passed her.

            Amber starts to shiver and grabs onto Spin, who lifts her 
off of the ice and holds her while skating around.  &#147;His eyes&#148; Amber 
whimpers with pure fear in her voice.

    ------------------------------------------------------------

Yesterday: Daidouji Residence

            &#147;You know, I wouldn&#146;t have saved him, if Sakura wasn&#146;t 
there&#148; said Tomoyo.

            &#147;Why?&#148; Spin asked patting herself down.

            &#147;Well, his eyes, they&#146;re really scary,&#148; Tomoyo starts to 
hug Sakura, &#147;they send a chill threw you.&#148;

            &#147;Uh, Tifa, we forgot our guns,&#148; Spin interrupted.

            &#147;Don&#146;t worry, Yuffie&#146;s been teaching me some stuff&#148; Tifa 
bragged before getting serious, &#147;Lets do it.&#148;

            Sakura opened the door and the two detectives entered.  As 
the entered it was dark, but Sakura turned the lights on.  Lying in a 
bed, in the center of the room, was man with neck length silver hair, 
and blue eyes.  Right as the lights came on he jumped up and started 
to grunt at them.  &#147;Hey, calm down,&#148; Spin suggested, but he didn&#146;t 
listen.  The man ran at them and knocked the detectives over, Tomoyo 
(Who was freaking out) grabbed Sakura and moved out of the way.

            He ran down the hall, and into a door at the end.  Spin 
and Tifa followed him in, only to find him jumping out of the window.  
Spin started to run towards the window but Tifa stopped her right at 
the edge.  &#147;Stop,&#148; yelled Tifa, &#147;are you crazy?&#148;

            &#147;Hey he did it.&#148;  With that she pulled her arm free and 
leaped out the window.

            &#147;Can&#146;t let her show me up again,&#148; Tifa yelled, following 
her best friend.  

            The man lands in the pool and pulls himself back up and 
out of the pool.

            &#147;Oh yeah&#148; Spin yelled right before she hit the water then 
comes back up. 

            &#147;Spin, I&#146;m gonna rape you and kill you&#148; Tifa screamed as 
she submerged herself.

            As Tifa gets out Spin yelled, &#147;Get the guns.&#148;  They 
separates at that point, Spin over a fence, and Tifa back to the car.

            Spin chased him over one fence, then two fences, then 
three fences, finally, they got to the road and as he crossed over a 
red car hits him.    Tifa get out as Spin runs across the front of the 
car.  The man gets up and leaps over another fence.  Tifa throws Spin 
her gun and they both open fire, but it was too late, he was gone.

    ------------------------------------------------------------

Back To Reality:

            &#147;Don&#146;t worry Amber, don&#146;t worry.&#148;

Monday May7 (Spin&#146;s Birthday and Yuffie&#146;s Final day of school in Tenth 
Grade)

         &#147;Man, I hope she passes,&#148; Tifa sighs, &#147; We gotta go and set 
up Spin&#146;s party.&#148;

            Its Monday, May 7, Spin&#146;s birthday (though irrelevant in 
the Dream World, it is still celebrated) and she is turning 25, one 
year older than Tifa, who has been waiting since her last birthday (a 
whole four days) to call Spin old, and today she finally could.

            But only if Yuffie would get out of the school soon 
(Hopefully with a passing grade).

            &#147;Where are you Yuffie,&#148; she sighs, putting her hand to her 
head.

            &#147;Right here&#148; Yuffie says getting into the car in the side 
seat.

            &#147;Yuffie,&#148; Tifa says startled, &#147;uh, did you pass?&#148;

            Yuffie looks down in disappointment, &#147;Well&#148; She says in a 
gloomy voice.  &#147;I passed&#148; she exclaims laughing and hugging Tifa. 

            &#147;Good job.&#148;

            &#147;It was all of our special teaching,&#148; Yuffie comments 
causing Tifa to blush before they heads out.

Later that day (at night): outside Amber and Spin&#146;s Apartment:

            &#147;Hey, Amber, you smell pizza?&#148; Spin asks sniffing the air.

            &#147;Maybe its one of the neighbors.&#148;

            &#147;Yeah, probably.&#148;  Spin berates.  She is mad, and sad. Its 
her birthday, and it rains, which she hates.  But it is worse than 
that.  All day with no sex, no gifts, no pizza, not even a happy 
birthday.  Amber had been avoiding the subject.  

            Amber opens the door and let herself in, Spin follows with 
her head down.  She walked into the dark room and didn&#146;t even notice 
the Amber had gone strait to the light switch, while giggling.    With 
a flip of the switch, Yuffie, Tifa, Lucca, Marle, Cloud, and Amber 
appear all yelling &#147;Happy Birthday.&#148;

            &#147;W-what?&#148;

            Amber walks up to Spin and taking her jacket off. &#147;You 
don&#146;t like,&#148; She says sarcastically while hanging up the jacket, &#147;I 
thought you would like a surprise party,&#148; she laughs out while 
grabbing Spin from behind.  &#147;Maybe I should just return the pizza.&#146;  
Amber walks around, &#147;and they can just leave now.&#148;

            &#147;No, no,&#148; Spin is at a loss f words, &#147;I only have one 
thing to say.&#148;

            &#147;And what&#146;s that?&#146; Tifa asks, &#147;Damn.&#148;

            &#147;No,&#148; Spin says sticking her tongue out at everyone who 
laughed (Which was everyone), &#147;Its lets party!&#148;

Reality-

What makes one real?

Is a dream real?

Is pain itself even real?

Maybe we aren&#146;t even real,

Some things are real and you can&#146;t touch them,

You can&#146;t see them,

Smell them, 
Or hear them.

Am I real??
