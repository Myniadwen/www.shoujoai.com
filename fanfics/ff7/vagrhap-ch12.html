<h1>Vagrants Rhapsody (part 12 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/pnkpanther9.html">PnkPanther9</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff7/vagrhap-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>She felt somewhat disoriented, as if somehow the camera that fed 
information to her brain had been knocked askew and was now seeing 
things from a different angle. Coming back to Barret&#39;s house and 
knocking on his front door, she felt like someone who had just found 
them selves floating down the spiritual river, reborn as someone new and 
fresh and glowing, rejuvenated with a newfound belief and filled to the 
brim with conviction and resolve for something better. It hummed from 
her chest and flowed throughout her limbs, brightening her face and 
managing to replace her usual morning grogginess.

Barret seemed a little taken aback by her glowing demeanor, and remarked 
offhandedly, &quot;Had yo&#39; self some fun now, didn&#39;cha?&quot;

Tifa could only grin.

Yuffie, her alacrity something that had won her a large amount of 
infamy, greeted the man with a similar warmth, clapping him on the back 
and giving him a wink. &quot;Didn&#39;t wreck Deevo, did you?&quot; she remarked.

Barret frowned at her as she stepped into the house after Tifa. Shutting 
the front door, he said in confusion, &quot;Deevo? What the hell&#39;s a 
&#39;dee-vo&#39;?&quot;

Tifa rolled her eyes. &quot;It&#39;s the name of her motorbike.&quot;

Barret&#39;s eyes widened as comprehension finally came. &quot;Oh! The bike!&quot; he 
waved her off. &quot;Please, kid. Ya think I&#39;d go near something like that? 
That thing&#39;s prob&#39;ly worth more than my house.&quot;

Yuffie smiled as she sat down at the couch, dropping her duffel bag at 
her feet as she did so. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to say that...it&#39;s more 
like it&#39;s worth half the house.&quot;

Thunder sounded through the house and in the next instant, Marlene came 
running down the stairs, hair bouncing as she descended. &quot;Tifa! Yuffie! 
You&#39;re back!&quot;

But as she came down the last steps, her feet tripped, and eyes 
widening, the young girl fell forward with a gasp. Barret started, 
moving to catch her, but Tifa was quicker. Foreseeing the girl&#39;s fall, 
the fighter had moved forward and at the sight of Marlene falling, she 
dropped her backpack to the floor and rushed forward.

Tifa caught the girl, wrapping her arms securely around the child as she 
lifted her up from the stairs and back securely on the floor. Sighing in 
relief, the woman placed a hand on the girl&#39;s head. &quot;That was so close!&quot;

Barret knelt down, a concerned look on his face. &quot;You okay? You didn&#39; 
twist yer ankle, right?&quot;

Marlene nodded slowly, eyes still wide. &quot;No papa. I&#39;m okay.&quot;

At this affirmation, Barret&#39;s face grew stern. &quot;How many times have I 
told ya not ta run down them stairs? You know your old man&#39;s nearly 
broke his own damn neck jes&#39; walkin&#39; slowly down those things!&quot;

&quot;Well...one could attribute that to your lousy footwork...&quot; Yuffie 
muttered under her breath.

Tifa shushed her.

Shooting a glare at the ninja, Barret stood to his feet. &quot;Some people 
jes&#39; don&#39; know when to keep their big yaps shut...&quot; the man muttered 
sorely as he trudged towards the kitchen.

Yuffie stuck her tongue out at his retreating back.

&quot;Ya&#39;ll care for some breakfast?&quot; Barret cried, &quot;I&#39;m no cook like Tifa 
but I&#39;ve gotten pretty good at omelets lately.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;d be nice!&quot; Tifa cried back.

&quot;So how&#39;d your trip go?&quot; Marlene asked excitedly, clutching at the sides 
of her blue nightgown.

Tifa kneeled down, smiling warmly. &quot;It was fun. We played video games, 
rode roller coasters, went to a haunted house... We even participated in 
a tournament!&quot;

&quot;And lost.&quot; Yuffie muttered sourly.

&quot;Did you win any cool things?&quot; Marlene asked, biting her lip and 
swinging her arms from side to side shyly.

Yuffie stiffened at this.

Tifa blinked. &quot;Um...well, no...&quot;

Marlene smiled softly, but it wasn&#39;t a smile of relief or joy. It was 
the tolerant, merciful smile people show when disappointed. &quot;Oh...&quot; 
Looking to her feet, she said with a shrug and a quiet voice, &quot;Too bad. 
Maybe next time you guys&#39;ll get something.&quot; And with that she shuffled 
toward the kitchen.

Tifa stared after her in confusion. What was wrong?

And then she remembered the promise Yuffie made to Marlene before they 
left.

&quot;I&#39;ll make sure to bring you back a BIG stuffed animal, okay Marlene?&quot;

She turned to see if Yuffie remembered too, and at the look of 
discomfort on the girl&#39;s face, she could tell she did. &quot;God damn it...&quot; 
Yuffie hissed under her breath.

Tifa stood and shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s okay, Yuffie,&quot; she said quietly, 
&quot;She&#39;ll get over it.&quot;

Yuffie slid down the couch so that her head came just above the armrest. 
&quot;No, kids hate it when grown-ups do stuff like this. Man, I feel like 
such a grade a jerk...&quot;

Tifa shrugged, &quot;We can get her something later.&quot;

Yuffie shook her head, &quot;That doesn&#39;t change the fact that I forgot!&quot;

&quot;Hey! You two!&quot; Barret shouted from the kitchen, &quot;Tell me what you want 
in your omelet&#39;s! If you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll just put whatever I find in the 
fridge!&quot;

Marlene peeked from the kitchen, &quot;Tell him what you want, quick! We have 
leftover meatloaf in the back of the fridge, and he isn&#39;t afraid to use 
it!&quot;

Tifa laughed a little, &quot;All right, just give us a moment.&quot;

Marlene nodded grimly. &quot;Okay...but you better hurry. Papa&#39;s hungry and 
he doesn&#39;t have much patience for cooking.&quot; The girl disappeared into 
the kitchen again.

Tifa looked down at Yuffie, who was still looking upset. &quot;Yuffie, we&#39;ll 
talk about this later. Right now I think we need to tell Barret what we 
want or else he&#39;ll feed us some terrible creation of his. ...And please 
try to refrain from any wisecracks. I know you two like to take jabs at 
each other, but one or both of you usually end up genuinely hurt or 
angry. Sometimes it&#39;s like watching two porcupines try to play with each 
other. One of them always gets a needle in its eye in the end.&quot;

Yuffie blinked, looking up at Tifa slowly.

&quot;...Tifa, you come up with some of the weirdest analogies sometimes.&quot;

----------

Tifa wasn&#39;t sure she wanted to take a bite out of it.

Sitting on her plate was a rather unappealing omelet, speckled green and 
brown with odd lumpy things swimming in the white. It didn&#39;t smell of 
eggs...it smelled of-

&quot;I told you he wasn&#39;t afraid to use the meat loaf...&quot; Marlene said 
sorrowfully.

Tifa lifted her head, looking at the girl across from her with a forlorn 
expression. &quot;Does he actually mean for me to eat this?&quot; she whispered, 
desperation flecking her voice.

Marlene nodded somberly.

&quot;What in Leviathan&#39;s name did he stick in MY omelet?&quot; Yuffie asked not 
even bothering to keep her voice down. She was sitting stiffly on the 
end of the table opposite the kitchen, giving the omelet on her plate a 
look of disgust.

Lifting the suspicious looking meal with her fork, she scrunched her 
nose and pointed at the purple lumps riddled across the egg. &quot;Are these 
prunes?&quot;

&quot;Relax, there ain&#39;t nothin&#39; wrong with it.&quot; Barret sat down at the other 
end of the table, setting down a large plate as he did so. His omelet 
looked perfectly normal, flecked with golden melted cheese and ham. 
Licking his lips, he cut off a large piece of the omelet with his fork.

&quot;Barret are you frickin&#39; trying to kill me?&quot; Yuffie exclaimed, glaring 
at the man across from her.

Tifa clenched her jaw and hissed, &quot;I thought I asked you to be civil!&quot;

Yuffie leaned forward and hissed back, &quot;This isn&#39;t exactly courteous of 
him, Tif!&quot;

Barret, swallowing down some of his omelet, shrugged. &quot;If ya don&#39; like 
it, don&#39; eat it, brat.&quot;

Yuffie scowled. &quot;Can&#39;t you at least tell me what you put in this thing?&quot; 
she indicated toward her omelet. &quot;&#39;Cuz, y&#39;know...what if I&#39;m allergic or 
something?&quot;

The man gave her a sarcastic look. &quot;Yuffie, what in the hell could ya 
possibly be allergic to?&quot;

Yuffie shrugged, crossing her arms. &quot;Plenty of things. I could be 
allergic to onions, to apricots, to tomatoes...hell, I could even be 
allergic to you!&quot; turning her head, she muttered aside, &quot;It&#39;d explain 
why I always feel nauseous while being near you.&quot;

Tifa, eyes widening, quickly reacted. Purposefully raising her voice, 
the woman said, &quot;SO! Marlene how was your day yesterday?&quot;

But Barret, with his keen hearing, narrowed his eyes. Leaning forward 
some with his fork clenched in one large fist, the man asked in a low 
voice. &quot;What was that, brat?&quot;

Yuffie, ignoring his question, instead asked, &quot;Why does Tifa&#39;s omelet 
have green and brown stuff and my omelet have this weird purple crap?&quot; 
She feigned a whiny voice. &quot;What if I wanted green and brown stuff in my 
omelet?&quot;

Marlene, following Tifa&#39;s lead, responded loudly, &quot;It was fine, Tifa!&quot;

&quot;I asked ya a question, you ungrateful lil&#39; witch!&quot; Barret boomed.

&quot;What did you do Marlene!&quot; Tifa cried, giving an insidious side-glance 
at Yuffie as she said this.

Yuffie, smiling condescendingly, said in a raised voice. &quot;OH! I&#39;m sorry, 
Barret! I didn&#39;t realize you asked me a question! I didn&#39;t pick it out 
from all your bad grammar!&quot;

Barret pointed a quaking finger at her, &quot;You ain&#39;t nothin&#39; but TROUBLE! 
You always gotta start somethin&#39;, now, don&#39;cha? You spoiled BRAT!&quot;

&quot;I played at the park!&quot; Marlene shouted, trying to cover her dad&#39;s 
voice.

Yuffie, leaning forward, shouted with a large grin, &quot;Well if certain 
individuals, BARRET, would stop acting like such royal pains in the ASS, 
MAYBE this little brat wouldn&#39;t act like such a JERK!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s great, Marlene! Did you make any new FRIENDS while you were 
there?&quot;

&quot;And if certain individuals, YUFFIE, would quit actin&#39; so goddamn 
INFURIATIN&#39;, than MAYBE this lil&#39; pain in the ass wouldn&#39;t treat &#39;em so 
damn SHITTY!&quot;

&quot;Yes, Tifa! I met a boy named Timmy and we played tag for a really, 
really long time!&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s just face it, Barret! You hate the fact that I hate your cooking 
because you hate facing the reality that you have NO business being in a 
KITCHEN!&quot;

&quot;Oh, REALLY? How old is Timmy, MARLENE?&quot;

&quot;YOUR REALLY AIMIN&#39; FOR ME TO SHOOT YO&#39; ASS, AIN&#39;T YA? YA POMPY-ASS 
PRINCESS! TOO DAMN UNGRATEFUL TOO-&quot;

&quot;HE&#39;S EIGHT YEARS OLD! BUT HE LOOKS LIKE-&quot;

&quot;YOU COULDN&#39;T SHOOT ME IF I WERE STANDING TWO FEET AWAY FROM YOU WITH A 
TARGET PAINTED ONTO MY-&quot;

&quot;SOMETIMES BOYS LOOK OLDER THAN THEY REALLY DO, BUT THAT&#39;S JUST-&quot;

&quot;ENOUGH!&quot;

Barret was standing, his face turned dark from shouting and his fists 
clenched at either side of his rigid body.

Yuffie, her cheeks tinged pink, leaned back and smiled.

&quot;Could you pass the salt please, Barret?&quot;

----------

&quot;Your lucky he didn&#39;t kill you.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s lucky I didn&#39;t throw his stupid omelet in his face. In Wutai, no 
host treats their guests that way!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re not in Wutai. Impatience is just part of Barret&#39;s personality, 
you should be used to that by now.&quot;

&quot;Well insubordination is part of mine, so he should be used to it too.&quot;

Tifa rolled her eyes skyward as she and Yuffie walked toward the park. 
Ahead of them, Barret and Marlene lead the way, the large man holding 
his daughter&#39;s hand. The day was proving to be a decent one, with the 
sky partially cloudy so that the morning sun spilled over the wispy 
bodies in a flow of light.

The park they were going to was near Barret&#39;s street, and it was large 
and expansive, with beautiful green trees that whispered to one another 
every time the wind so much as picked up to a breeze. The grass was 
plush and healthy, surrounding the jungle gym in a sweep of color. Tifa 
marveled at how the bright colors of the jungle gym accented the green 
grass and the aqua lit sky. Eyes growing spacey, she focused for a 
moment on what her senses picked up on...everything seemed clearer, 
crisper, as if the color level on a monitor had been raised. Breathing 
in deeply, she closed her eyes for a moment and smiled as she let out a 
laugh.

Yuffie glanced at her, curious. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;

Tifa opened her eyes and looked slowly over to her friend. She held her 
breath as she looked into Yuffie&#39;s large, hazelnut eyes, awe taking over 
her at how vibrant and alive they seemed as the sunlight lit them. Even 
Yuffie&#39;s skin seemed to glow, youthful and unblemished, radiating in the 
morning sun. ...And then Tifa&#39;s eyes fell to Yuffie&#39;s lips. They were a 
vibrant shade of pink, bow shaped, though slightly dry. Yuffie had the 
habit of sweeping her tongue over her lips...

Tifa&#39;s mouth watered.

&quot;Tifa?&quot;

And like that the trance was gone, and the fighter was brought out of 
her deep reverie. She realized with serious discomfort that Yuffie was 
giving her a strange look; the girl&#39;s cheeks turned a vibrant pink. 
&quot;What&#39;re you staring at?&quot; she asked, looking embarrassed and thoroughly 
confused herself.

Tifa, her eyes widening, shook her head and turned away. The woman 
stiffly answered, &quot;Nothing.&quot;

Yuffie slowed a bit, staring at her friend with a calculating gaze. 
After a moment, the girl sped up so that she was walking next to Tifa 
again, one hand on her hip and the other hand rubbing the back of her 
neck.

Marlene was already swinging on the swings by the time the two arrived, 
Barret behind her, pushing.

Smiling at them both as they passed, the two girls sat at the benches 
behind the jungle gym, both sighing wearily as they leaned back against 
the wooden seats.

Tifa, though she could feel her stomach clench uncomfortably at the 
memory, tried to think on the reaction she had just felt to the thoughts 
she had. What sort of reaction was that for a friend to have for a 
friend? Was there some deep underlying meaning to it, or was the answer 
simple? When a person saw a bit of fruit and their mouths salivated, it 
was because the person found the food to be desirable for consumption. 
...But when a person&#39;s mouth watered for another person, the first thing 
one would think would be that the first person found the other to be 
sexually attractive. ...But, what if that other person were the same 
gender as the first? What then?

Tifa clutched at the necklace around her neck, the butterfly pendant 
digging into her skin as she clenched her fist around it tightly.

The fighter swallowed hard, as if somehow swallowing the spit in her 
mouth would also wash away the thoughts that were spinning around in her 
head. They tread frightening waters and the fighter wasn&#39;t quite sure 
she was ready to face what lurked in the inky black depths.

So when Yuffie began to talk, she eagerly listened. Anything was better 
than the possibility of-

&quot;I wonder what it&#39;s like to have kids.&quot; Yuffie stated, leaning forward 
and leaning on her knees as she watched Marlene and Barret at the 
swings. &quot;To have a family, I mean.&quot;

Tifa blinked at her, now not certain if she were really as eager to have 
this conversation as she may have initially thought. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t know.&quot; 
Was her bland reply. She shifted uncomfortably as Yuffie continued.

&quot;Imagine, a bunch of little rug rats scurrying around my ankles and 
calling me mama! ...What a laugh!&quot; the girl leaned back again, placing 
her hands behind her head as she slouched down her seat. &quot;But I can&#39;t 
help but wonder what it would be like...to have a kid.&quot;

A pause.

&quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;d get along very well.&quot; She said with a sort of sad 
finality.

Tifa frowned at her. &quot;Why do you say that?&quot;

Yuffie shrugged. &quot;Look at me an&#39; my old man. We both drive each other 
crazy.&quot;

The woman bit her lip. &quot;Um...well, what about your mom?&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s hands came down slowly onto her lap. &quot;What about her?&quot; she 
asked stiffly, her eyes gazing fixedly toward Barret and Marlene.

&quot;What was she like? Do you...remember much about her?&quot;

Yuffie didn&#39;t say anything for a moment. Then she slowly shook her head. 
&quot;No. I don&#39;t.&quot;

An awkward silence fell between them. Tifa found herself regretting even 
bringing up Yuffie&#39;s mother. She knew it was a sensitive nerve and yet 
she had prodded anyway. The woman mentally kicked herself repeatedly.

&quot;He reminds me a lot of him, y&#39;know. Maybe that&#39;s why...I kinda like 
fighting with him.&quot;

Tifa blinked rapidly, giving the ninja next to her a puzzled look at the 
blurted remark. &quot;...Um, what?&quot;

Marlene had stopped swinging. She was running toward a group of children 
her age, one of them carrying a soccer ball. Waving at Barret, she 
joined the children as they began to play, and waving back, the man 
walked back to where the two girls were sitting. Crashing down in 
between them, Barret let out a loud sigh.

&quot;So glad Marlene made some friends &#39;round here...was always by herself 
back at Midgar.&quot; Barret nodded solemnly, &quot;It&#39;s &#39;bout time she found 
herself some kids to play wid.&quot; Then he laughed boisterously. &quot;Makes 
life helluva &#39;lot easier on me! Don&#39;t gotta worry so much &#39;bout runnin&#39; 
here and there all crazy as if I were still eight or somethin&#39;.&quot;

Yuffie snorted. &quot;Lazy bum.&quot; She muttered.

Barret shot her a glare but said nothing, and it was here that Tifa 
finally understood Yuffie&#39;s sudden remark earlier.

&quot;Barret reminds Yuffie of her father.&quot; Tifa thought, a little startled 
at this revelation.

...But the more she thought about it, the more it seemed to make sense.

No one in the group griped about Yuffie as much as Barret. Cid may have 
argued with the girl from time to time, but as far as tempers went, 
Barret took the cake. Despising anyone that would challenge his 
authority, to have such a condescending young girl challenge him at 
every step infuriated him. But this was why the girl did it. Because she 
knew she could get Barret angry with her. She knew what buttons to push, 
when to push them...even when she had first met the man, she had always 
known what to do to anger him most.

And she did this of her own accord, purposefully picking fights with him 
during missions and whilst traveling...and now Tifa finally knew why.

It was because the ninja had been homesick...or perhaps, she simply 
missed her father, their fights and all.

After another lapse of silence, Yuffie stood quickly from the bench. 
Rubbing her hands together, she looked down at her companions. &quot;You two 
are dull. I&#39;m gonna go play some soccer with the kids.&quot; And without 
another word, she jogged toward the children, who after a brief moment 
of introduction by Marlene integrated the older girl into their game 
without so much as a hitch.

Tifa watched happily along with Barret as Yuffie played keep-away with 
the kids. Every so often, she allowed them to steal the ball back when 
she thought she had toyed with them enough...then, of course, she&#39;d 
steal it back again. After several times of this, the children finally 
gave up trying to steal the ball back, instead opting to tackle the girl 
down and assault her with tickling. Yuffie&#39;s laughter drifted to where 
Barret and Tifa sat, clear as white materia, and the two friends smiled 
in amusement at their antics.

&quot;So you two had fun in Gold Saucer?&quot; Barret asked conversationally, his 
eyes still watching the tomfoolery nearby.

Tifa nodded, &quot;Yeah. We had a lot of fun. I kinda wished we did a bit of 
betting at the chocobo races, though.&quot;

Barret nodded as well, turning to glance briefly at the woman. He did a 
double take however as his eyes caught sight of her still clutching at 
her necklace. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;

Tifa looked at him. &quot;What&#39;s what?&quot; then she followed his line of vision 
down to her hand. &quot;Oh!&quot;

Opening her hand, Tifa lifted the pendant up with her thumb and index 
finger. &quot;This? It&#39;s a necklace Yuffie bought me a few days ago.&quot;

Tifa, feeling somewhat sheepish, had almost forgotten about the necklace 
since the trip started, even though she had never taken it off since the 
day of the festival back at Tiesmire.

Barret raised an eyebrow as he leaned forward to see the pendant better. 
&quot;Yuffie got you that?&quot; he narrowed his eyes. &quot;She did?&quot;

Tifa scowled at him. &quot;Yes! She did!&quot; she let go of the pendant, turning 
away from the man. &quot;And wipe that look off your face, there was no 
ulterior motive there!&quot;

Barret shrugged. &quot;Random generosity isn&#39;t really Yuffie&#39;s thang, but 
whateva...I guess it was nice of her to do.&quot;

Tifa crossed her arms, but not even her indignation at Barret&#39;s mistrust 
could stave the thought that drifted into her head.

&quot;Yeah...she really isn&#39;t much for giving gifts, is she...? So why&#39;d she 
do it?&quot;

----------

&quot;Well, big man, it was nice seein&#39; ya again and all that. Your lucky you 
didn&#39;t scratch Deevo, or I would&#39;ve given you a reason to buy a second 
mechanical hand.&quot;

&quot;Just get on outta here, brat. Your voice gives me one helluva 
headache.&quot;

Barret&#39;s garage was a large one that made Yuffie&#39;s motorbike seem like a 
child&#39;s bicycle. There was nothing in it, save for a few boxes stacked 
in the furthest corner as well as some paint buckets sitting on a wooden 
table next to the door leading into the house. Barret lamented that for 
all his influence, he still didn&#39;t have a car of his own yet.

&quot;Never did get the hang of driving any how...&quot; the man had muttered.

Their things already strapped onto Yuffie&#39;s bike, the girls said their 
goodbyes, Marlene clutching sadly to Tifa&#39;s leg.

Tifa patted her head, a complacent smile coming over her face as she 
tried to comfort the small child. &quot;I&#39;ll see you again soon, 
Marlene...don&#39;t you worry.&quot;

Marlene sniffed and her eyes began to water. Looking up at Tifa with a 
trembling lip, the girl said shakily. &quot;But last time you said you&#39;d come 
see me, you didn&#39;t come back for a really, really, really long time!&quot;

Tifa felt a pang of guilt go searing through her as she heard this. She 
didn&#39;t realize what her isolation had done to those she still cared 
about...like Marlene. Kneeling down, the woman hugged the girl hard. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Marlene...I didn&#39;t mean to make you wait so long. I promise 
you this time...I promise that I&#39;ll come back soon!&quot; Tifa pulled back 
and wiped away some of Marlene&#39;s tears, trying to keep her own emotions 
in check. &quot;...Okay?&quot;

Marlene nodded, and Tifa could see the girl fight with all her might not 
to allow any more tears to fall. Tifa hugged her again, harder.

Yuffie, who had been fiddling with something on the bike, appeared once 
again at Tifa&#39;s side, hiding something behind her back. When Tifa stood 
back up, the ninja spoke, shuffling her feet as she did so. &quot;Marlene, I 
know I promised to bring you back something from Gold Saucer, and I&#39;m 
really sorry I screwed that up...but...&quot; she pulled what she was hiding 
out from behind her back.

It was the fat chocobo plushy she had tied to her bike.

&quot;I refuse to leave without leaving you with a stuffed animal.&quot;

Marlene, eyes still watery and cheeks tear-stained, suddenly smiled 
hugely, grabbing the chocobo plushy and hugging it hard. &quot;It&#39;s so cute!&quot; 
she squealed. Looking up at Yuffie, she ran and hugged the woman around 
the waist, knocking the ninja a little off balance. &quot;Thank you, Yuffie!&quot;

Yuffie, a little startled at the strong reaction to her impromptu gift, 
leaned down and hugged the girl awkwardly, a sheepish grin on her face.

Barret smiled at her, a softer look in his dark eyes.

&quot;Well, Barret,&quot; Tifa said, rubbing her arm, &quot;I guess we&#39;d better-&quot;

&quot;C&#39;mere, the BOTH a&#39; ya!&quot; Barret boomed, sweeping the two women into 
another one of his bear hugs. Tifa and Yuffie simultaneously shouted as 
they felt their spines being crushed.

&quot;Enough! ENOUGH!&quot;

&quot;Get-off me! You-big-JERK!&quot;
