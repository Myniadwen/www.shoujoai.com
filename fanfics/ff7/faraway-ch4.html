<h1>Far Away to Eternity (part 4 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff7/faraway-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>I&#146;m going to try something a little different with this chapter: switch 
between Aeris&#146;s and Tifa&#146;s(this is the one I use usually...I think I&#146;m 
playing favorites) POV here and there. If you prefer this way after 
reading the chapter, tell me please. If you don&#146;t...well you can tell me 
that too. 

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
Before going to Junon, Cloud instructed Tifa to follow him and the 
others to &quot;the place with the bird on it.&quot; Tifa had chuckled and shook 
her head at his choice of words, and Aeris had giggled. Oddly enough, 
Tifa was somewhat pleased Yuffie had decided to join the party. This 
meant that she had help on the offensive side of her party, and Aeris 
could spend more time using healing spells.
 
&quot;Ahead on our way, we&#146;re journeying &#145;cross the world! Come along with 
us, and watch our adventure unfurl!&quot;
 
The singing, however, was not something she enjoyed.

&quot;Would you shut up?&quot; she grumbled, walking ahead.

&quot;Geez,&quot; Yuffie said, running to catch up, with Aeris at her heels, &quot;what 
a sourpuss. How can anyone resist my singing skills?&quot;

&quot;I liked the song...it was very um...creative,&quot; Aeris said, grinning weakly.

Tifa sighed exasperatedly.

&quot;Do you ever smile?&quot; Yuffie asked her, frowning.

&quot;She smiles,&quot; Aeris whispered, &quot;but she&#146;s been grouchy lately.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;

Aeris nodded, and when she was out of earshot, she smiled softly and 
whispered to Yuffie,

&quot;She should smile more often. She has a lovely smile.&quot;
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
&quot;Welcome to Fort Condor,&quot; the man at the entrance said placidly, staring 
at the three young women in front of him.

&quot;Thank you. By any chance, did you see a man with spiky blonde hair pass 
by here?&quot; Tifa asked.

&quot;Yes. Are you a part of his group?&quot;

&quot;Occasionally,&quot; Tifa muttered.

&quot;What was that?&quot;

&quot;Oh, sorry, I mean, yes, we are.&quot;

&quot;Ahh...well then, he&#146;s right inside, go up ahead.&quot;

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
After Cloud agreed to help the people of Fort Condor with the Shinra, 
the two groups separated again and headed for Junon.

&quot;Geez, this place is a dump!&quot; Yuffie said loudly as soon as they 
arrived. Tifa covered her mouth and Aeris gave her a pained look.

&quot;Would you learn to keep your mouth shut?&quot; Tifa hissed, blanching when 
she realized the people of the town were staring at them.

&quot;Come on...&quot; Aeris murmured, pushing them both toward the meager inn. &quot;We 
don&#146;t want you two to start fighting again.&quot;

&quot;Of course not Aeris...I won&#146;t fight her if you don&#146;t want me to,&quot; Yuffie 
said, smiling brightly at the flower girl, who gave her a tentative 
smile back.

&quot;See, you two can get along just fine! You should take Yuffie&#146;s example, 
Tifa,&quot; Aeris said somberly.

Tifa bit back a retort, and walked toward the inn, looking over her 
shoulder at Yuffie, who was talking animatedly to Aeris.

&quot;Suck up...&quot; she muttered, fighting the odd urge to pout.
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
She was dreaming.

This did not happen often while they rested at odd places along the 
road, because her thoughts were too jumbled to collect as she drifted 
off into sleep. The Planet itself regularly kept her from sleeping; 
sometimes, the screams would be too loud for her to block out. Tonight 
though, it was peaceful, and quiet.
 
&quot;Hey, Aeris!&quot; a voice she remembered all too well yelled to her.

&quot;Zack?&quot; she whispered, staring around. It was far too dark to see where 
she was, and the direction his voice was coming from was too hard to pin 
down.

&quot;Yeah, it&#146;s me. I&#146;m sorry you can&#146;t see anything. How&#146;s life been?&quot;

This is...weird, Aeris thought, still trying in vain to see into the inky 
blackness, my dreams are never like this.

&quot;It&#146;s been...interesting. How about you?&quot;

&quot;Ahh, I&#146;m here and there. Umm...met anyone?&quot; Aeris laughed; this was still 
the same old Zack.

&quot;I&#146;ve...met a whole group, actually. My friends...we&#146;re going to save the 
Planet.&quot;

&quot;From Shinra? Good luck, they rule everything.&quot;

That&#146;s not quite it...something greater, Aeris thought.

&quot;No...from them...yes, but from something...from another force, greater than 
Shinra, greater than...everything.&quot;

&quot;Geez, you&#146;re still mysterious, I see. That&#146;s what I always liked about 
you. Greater than everything, hmm? You scared?&quot;

&quot;...A little...I&#146;m not sure.&quot;

&quot;Ahh...I see, I see. So...met any...love interests? I hope you&#146;re not still 
pining after me, I know how great of a boyfriend I was.&quot; 

Aeris laughed, shaking her head. 

&quot;There&#146;s someone that reminds me of you...and, well...&quot;

&quot;You like him?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but, there&#146;s something...odd. Odd about him, about the way he 
speaks, the way he acts. It&#146;s like...you...too much like you. I want to...help 
him find...the real him, his real self.&quot;

&quot;...Hmm. That is odd. Does he have a girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;He has...a friend. I think she loves him very much,&quot; she winced inwardly, 
and she wasn&#146;t  really sure why, &quot;but...something is holding her back. I 
think she knows that she isn&#146;t talking to the real him.&quot;

&quot;You like her? I mean, are you two friends?&quot;

&quot;I...don&#146;t know what we are. She seems so strong, but so angry sometimes, 
and sad. I want...&quot;

&quot;What do you want Aeris?&quot; Zack&#146;s voice was softer now, and it mingled 
with another voice that vaguely reminded her of her mother&#146;s.

&quot;I want to help her too. She...I can help her, alone. The other...he needs 
more than I can give, but I...I&#146;ll still try.&quot;

&quot;Does she care for you?&quot;

&quot;No...I think...she hates me,&quot; Aeris whispered. Saying it was more painful 
than she had first thought.

&quot;Hey, nobody can hate you. She&#146;s probably just a little angry, is all. 
Go talk to her.&quot;

&quot;But it&#146;s late...&quot;

&quot;Wake her up then. If she hates you, she&#146;ll probably deck you one. If 
she doesn&#146;t, she&#146;ll stay up and listen. Now, go give it a try!&quot;
 
With that, Aeris was roughly pushed out of her dream.
 
&quot;...I really hope she doesn&#146;t deck me.&quot;

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
Tifa was a very light sleeper, so she heard someone enter her room 
before she saw them. She immediately tensed, but was careful not to 
move.

&quot;Tifa?&quot;

Just Aeris, she thought. I wonder why she&#146;s in here?

&quot;What is it?&quot; she grumbled, turning around to face Aeris, who still 
stood hesitantly at the doorway.

&quot;Um, I just wanted to see if you were awake...&quot; Tifa growled under her 
breath and pointed her finger in the direction of a snoring Yuffie.

&quot;Yeah, some of us don&#146;t get special treatment, so I was forced to share 
a room with her.&quot; In reality, Tifa had been able to tune out the noise, 
but the wicked part of herself just wanted to see Aeris squirm.

Aeris did indeed squirm, looking down at her feet. 

&quot;I&#146;m sorry...&quot; An idea hit her and she perked up.

&quot;How about you just share my room with me? I wanted to talk to you 
anyway.&quot;

Tifa blinked, and looked around the room.

Oh no...that&#146;s not what I was going for, but I can&#146;t refuse now, after I 
did complain about it...arrgh, stupid!
 
She gazed in the direction of Yuffie, and then to a slightly hopeful 
looking Aeris.

&quot;Well...alright...&quot;

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

Aeris almost skipped back to her room, with a slightly disgruntled Tifa 
in tow.

Wow, I can&#146;t believe Zack was right...

She made it to her room and Tifa followed after, sighing and sitting 
down on the edge of the bed.

&quot;So...um, what did you want to talk about?&quot; Tifa asked, toying with the 
bedspread.

&quot;Do you hate me Tifa?&quot; 

Tifa blanched and looked up quickly.

&quot;Of course I don&#146;t! Why would you think...oh...&quot;

&quot;Right...&quot;

They both sat in an uncomfortable silence, until Aeris spoke again.

&quot;If you don&#146;t...then...why are you so...mean to me? What did I do wrong? If I 
did anything, I&#146;m sorry, really.&quot;

Tifa couldn&#146;t remember a time where she had felt more embarrassed and 
foolish.

&quot;You didn&#146;t do anything wrong, Aeris...&quot;

&quot;Then why?&quot;

&quot;I...I don&#146;t know. I guess...&quot; she trailed off. She didn&#146;t want to say she 
was jealous. It seemed like such a petty emotion. 

Aeris looked down at the bedspread, trying to sort out her thoughts.

&quot;I...I want you to like me. I know it&#146;s a little pathetic, but I look up 
to you. I just...I don&#146;t know if I can deal with...all of this.&quot;

Tifa  was about to say something else, when she heard barely audible 
sniffles.

Oh please don&#146;t tell me she&#146;s crying. 

&quot;...If I bother you so much, I&#146;ll leave, I promise,&quot; her voice cracked a 
little.

Yep, crying.

&quot;Listen...Aeris...don&#146;t cry.&quot; The sniffles grew louder, and Tifa patted 
Aeris&#146;s shoulder gently.

&quot;Please stop crying?&quot; Aeris didn&#146;t stop, and Tifa was beginning to lose 
her patience.

&quot;Please? Oh, come on...I&#146;m really sorry Aeris...&quot; she pulled the girl into a 
stiff embrace, hoping she would cease her sniffles, but they only 
escalated to sobs.

So frustrated was Tifa with the distraught flower girl, that she did the 
only thing she could think of.

She kissed her.

Aeris eyes shot open, and she almost opened her mouth, until she 
remembered she was being kissed.

Oh...my...

When Tifa was sure Aeris had stopped crying, she pulled away, slightly 
proud of herself.

She stared at Aeris, and her silly grin evaporated into a dumbfounded 
look.

What in the HELL did I just do?
