<h1>Innocente (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff7/innocente-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Jessie did not often acknowledge many of her talents, but one thing she 
was proud of was her powers of observation. She was, for the most part, 
a very quiet girl, though most people mistook it for shyness, when they 
first encountered her. Her time with Biggs and Wedge had allowed her to 
fine tune her ability to observe until she eventually became an 
excellent judge of character. That was why the three sat together now, 
quietly going over their meeting with one Tifa Lockheart.

&quot;What do you think, Jess?&quot; Biggs ran a hand through his short, black 
hair, steel-gray eyes watching everything at once. His gaze was not like 
Jessie&#39;s, quiet, contemplative. Biggs saw things, skimmed over them, 
moved on. &quot;She&#39;s cute, huh?&quot;

Wedge coughed in the corner, rolling his eyes to the ceiling. &quot;Yeah, 
she&#39;s real cute.&quot;

Biggs scoffed. &quot;I didn&#39;t ask you. Come on, Jess, what do you think?&quot; 
Jessie toyed with her glasses, frowning in concentration. Biggs always 
wanted to know what she thought. It was endearing, for the most part, 
but at times it became taxing, especially when she was as perplexed as 
she was now. She didn&#39;t know what to think of Tifa, really. The way 
Barret had described her, she had expected someone as boisterous as 
Biggs, but the actual Tifa was far more subdued. She asked questions, 
but she never probed too deeply. She never asked for anything more than 
what Jessie could offer, in their talks together. She was an excellent 
listener, and Jessie found herself opening up a bit more than she had 
intended to. She was a good person; Jessie thought, just, there was 
something else, something that seemed a little off.

&quot;She seems nice,&quot; Jessie finally responded, nibbling on the nail of her 
ring finger. &quot;But I think you should get to know her a little bit 
better, before you start to flirt.&quot;

Biggs, to his credit, looked sheepish. &quot;I dunno, Jess. She&#39;s really 
pretty.&quot;

&quot;She looks like she&#39;s been through a lot,&quot; Wedge piped up, stretching 
his arms. The boy was more solidly built than Biggs, and just a little 
overweight. &quot;So I don&#39;t think she&#39;s lookin&#39; for a boyfriend.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Biggs ran a hand along the side of his jaw, a nervous gesture. 
&quot;We&#39;ve all been through a lot, I guess. Whatever happened to her; I bet 
it was the Shinra.&quot; His eyes darkened, and he fell silent, quietly 
brooding. His mother and father had been killed by the Turks, a result 
of his father&#39;s illegal weapon trafficking during the war of Wutai, and 
Biggs became yet another orphan, another faceless child in the slums of 
Midgar. He had found Jessie shortly thereafter, rooting around in a 
garbage can. When he asked her if she was looking for food, she had 
responded in the negative, and informed him that she was looking for a 
piece of metal to finish making a taser. He had thought she was crazy, 
until he saw the thing. From then on, he had &#39;kept Jessie around,&#39; as he 
put it, for &#39;insurance.&#39; Jessie followed him because she believed he 
needed the extra help. He hadn&#39;t been as tough when they had first met. 
That had been years ago though. Jessie stretched her arms behind her 
head, yawning. She had no idea what had happened to Tifa, but she had no 
doubt in her mind that Biggs was correct.

&quot;Yeah, I bet it was.&quot;

The little trio was silent after that, hearts heavy with memories of 
their own.

----------

One morning, Tifa asked Jessie to accompany her to Sector Five. Jessie 
had never really visited that particular Sector before, but she 
remembered there being a junkyard nearby, and a playground. Tifa seemed 
very excited about the whole thing, but Jessie knew the slums better, 
knew the dangers involved.

&quot;Just us girls?&quot; Tifa asked, slipping on a pair of worn-in gloves. They 
looked to be made of some sort of black cloth, with iron bands along the 
knuckles.

&quot;I think we should take Biggs, just in case. It&#39;s really dangerous in 
the slums. You haven&#39;t been here for a long time, have you? You don&#39;t 
look like you&#39;re from Midgar.&quot; To be honest, Jessie would have enjoyed 
the time with Tifa, but Barret would probably worry about them both. 
Tifa had mentioned knowing martial arts, but Jessie took in her pale 
skin and small build, and figured she wasn&#39;t exactly up to fighting off 
bad guys, not yet.

&quot;My mom was from Wutai,&quot; Tifa responded distractedly, tying the laces of 
her boots, &quot;and my dad was from...a place called Nibelheim. Mom visited 
Nibelheim right before the war, and never left. I was born there, lived 
there my whole life.&quot;

&quot;Hometown?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you could say that. It&#39;s gone now, though.&quot; Before Jessie could 
ask what she meant, Tifa had already moved toward the makeshift elevator 
in the bar. She tied her long hair back into a messy ponytail as she 
waited for the elevator to lower, tapping one steel-plated sole against 
the floor. &quot;I&#39;m going to go get Biggs. You mind waiting a minute?&quot;

&quot;No, not at all. You&#39;re the guide, after all.&quot; Jessie knew without 
looking that Tifa was smiling.

&quot;Right. But maybe...you could lead the way? I know where we&#39;re going, 
just...&quot; Tifa gave her an embarrassed grin. Biggs had been right; she 
really was sort of cute.

&quot;Yeah, sure. No problem.&quot; Jessie lowered her head onto the countertop, 
sighing at the feeling of cool wood against her forehead. She had no 
idea what Tifa wanted to show her, but she was sure it was exciting. 
Tifa seemed pretty exciting; she was full of energy. She heard the 
elevator start up, and Tifa and Biggs popped up. Tifa was laughing at a 
joke Biggs had just told her. Jessie smiled as well, though she had no 
idea what the boy had just said. Their laughter was contagious.

On the way out, Biggs put his hand on the small of Tifa&#39;s back to lead 
her out, and Jessie forced down the odd feeling in her stomach.

----------

Meanwhile, Aeris was just preparing to leave the house, hefting her 
staff over her shoulder before calling out to her mother.

&quot;I&#39;m gone, Mom! Be back soon!&quot;

She heard an exasperated sigh, and then a defeated, &quot;Well...please, just 
be careful, alright?&quot; Aeris allowed herself to smile. Her mom really did 
love her, and she hated to make her worry, but she had to watch over the 
flowers. She felt a connection there; the connection to the Planet that 
her...real mother had told her about in furtive whispers as they 
prepared for the next set of experiments that awful man would put them 
through. She remembered a lot about Ilfana, but over the years, some 
details had faded in her mind: the curve of her mouth when she smiled, 
the way she smelled, how she laughed. She didn&#39;t want to forget, and she 
never would, but her memories had become disjointed over time. It made 
her a little sad. She wanted to talk to someone about it, but she only 
had mom to talk to, and it felt like a betrayal of sorts, mentioning her 
birth mother in front of Elmyra. Mom had been nothing but good to her; 
she didn&#39;t want to make her sad either. It wasn&#39;t fair at all, what with 
all the worrying she put her through. She really wished she could 
explain, but it was always far too difficult to explain it to people. 
They just couldn&#39;t understand, not even Mom.

She set the staff down carefully for a moment as she bent to tie her 
boots. The staff was surprisingly well-made; it had been a birthday gift 
from her Mom. The Materia inside shone brightly, a Fire Materia. That 
had been a gift from Zack, right before he left. She wondered what had 
happened to him. Mom always said he was good-for-nothing, but she felt 
that he had a good soul. Zack was a good person. She hoped he was 
alright.

I got you a Magic Materia, &#39;cause it&#39;s the same color as your eyes. Hope 
you like it! I wanted to get you something practical, since it&#39;s so 
dangerous out here. She smiled at the memory. He really had been a 
ladies&#39; man; probably found someone else. The thought sent an 
uncomfortable stab through her heart. She really had loved him a lot, 
but now, she only hoped he was alive, even if he was with someone else. 
Her thoughts moved to her meeting from a couple of days ago, with the 
girl named Tifa. She seemed very cheerful, and bright, older than her 
years. A little rash, Aeris thought, but she believed she had a good 
head on her shoulders; she could feel it. Aeris had never really had 
many friends, and Tifa was the only person who had looked at her gift 
with flowers in wonder, instead of fear. She hadn&#39;t seen that sort of 
innocence before in a while. Zack had a bit of it, but it was buried 
underneath training regiments, bright Mako eyes and too many fights. 
Everyone was so hard now, so rough around the edges. They had built up 
so many layers to keep from feeling pain each time a disappointment hit 
them, and their innocence was pushed underneath, so far away that 
nothing could reach it. You&#39;d only see glimmers here and there; a small 
glance of what had been lost. Midgar was like that as well, the whole 
city was a wayward child without innocence, only harsh steel and 
forgotten promises. She hoped this city would not break Tifa, but she 
had seen it so many times in her short time here; she wasn&#39;t sure the 
girl would make it. She prayed, for her sake, that she would. Even from 
her short meeting, she knew Tifa was a good person, just like Zack had 
been. It would be a shame to see someone like that break under the 
pressure of Midgar&#39;s cruelty.

She shook herself from her thoughts, making her trek to the church with 
quick, purposeful strides. It would do no good to dawdle; there were 
monsters all through Midgar, a result of their callous rape on the 
planet. Monsters were attracted to the wellspring of lifestream energy 
the reactors pumped away.

She quickened her steps. Perhaps she would see Tifa today.

----------

&quot;Hmm...I know it&#39;s around here somewhere...&quot; Tifa continued to follow 
Jessie and Biggs, shaking the boy&#39;s hand off gently when he tried to 
lead her. He was a nice guy, and he was awfully cute, but she really 
wasn&#39;t ready for something like that. Besides, she noticed things, and 
she thought Jessie might like Biggs, just a little bit. She didn&#39;t want 
to get into the middle of that. Biggs was cute, but he wasn&#39;t worth a 
friendship, not really. She barely knew him, anyway.

&quot;So...&quot; Biggs rocked from side to side, scratching his chin. &quot;You mean 
to tell me there&#39;s a church around her somewhere? I don&#39;t remember any 
church. You sure it wasn&#39;t something else?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure. It was a church.&quot;

&quot;What did you see in the church?&quot; Jessie asked curiously, looking from 
side to side. They had been attacked by a few monsters earlier, and 
Jessie was still on edge. Tifa and Biggs had dispatched of them with 
their fists easily, but that still didn&#39;t mean that the trip had been 
easy. At the thought, Tifa rubbed her shoulder, sore from where a 
monster had rammed into her. She really needed some armor, but Barret 
had mentioned gil being tight, what with four teenagers and a baby under 
the roof. He did odd jobs, but it was barely enough to make ends meet. 
Tifa hoped she would get her strength back soon; she&#39;d help even if he 
didn&#39;t want her too. She had never been an ungracious guest, and helping 
Barret make some gil was the least she could do, after he had saved her 
life. She barely remembered how she had gotten to Midgar. She&#39;d get 
flashes here and there, the fire, then pain, glimpses of Master Zangan 
hurriedly preparing a Cure spell, tears running down his weathered face. 
When she finally gained consciousness, Master Zangan had left, and she 
was alone. She had darted when the doctor asked her for payment; she had 
no money, how did he expect her to pay? The adrenaline was gone as 
quickly as it had come, and she found herself surrounded by leering 
punks almost immediately. That&#39;s when Barret had came to the rescue, 
large and imposing, his right arm replaced by a dangerous-looking 
machine gun. Those punks had bolted out of there really fast, after 
that, and when she tried to thank Barret, she passed out all over again. 
When she awoke, a little baby was crawling all over her, gurgling. The 
baby had big, brown eyes and a little tuft of brownish-blonde hair on 
her head. &quot;That&#39;s Marlene,&quot; she heard Barret say. &quot;My daughter.&quot; At 
Tifa&#39;s confused look, he laughed. &quot;I kinda adopted her. You aw&#39;right? 
You hungry? Thirsty?&quot;

&quot;A glass of water would be nice.&quot;

&quot;Aw&#39;right. Hey, you can stay here while you get better. You fight, 
right? I saw those gloves.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. You want me...to stay?&quot; She wondered what her dad would think, 
her staying in a strange place with this big man and his little girl. 
Barret seemed to read her mind and shook his head.

&quot;Naw, naw, don&#39;t think nothin&#39; like that. I ain&#39;t like that; I ain&#39;t 
gonna hurt you. You just look like you had a rough time of it, is all. 
You ain&#39;t gotta stay if you don&#39;t wanna.&quot; His shoulders slumped, and she 
watched him grab a glass, and balance a baby bottle with a surprising 
show of dexterity. &quot;Jes&#39; don&#39;t want no girl out there on the streets, by 
herself. You could get yo&#39;self killed. And it won&#39;t be for free, not 
really. I do a lot of stuff on the side, gotta have someone here to take 
care of Marlene.&quot;

Tifa stared at the little baby, and picked her up, listening to her coo. 
&quot;I can do that,&quot; she said, and it was settled. Barret had never tried 
anything; he was a good guy, a really great dad too, even though he 
couldn&#39;t be around all the time. But Marlene loved him more than 
anything, Tifa could tell. She had been really lucky to find him. And 
now she had Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie, Aeris too. Her life was looking up 
a little. She trotted up ahead and pointed to the small church in the 
distance.

&quot;There it is! I knew it was around here! Let&#39;s go! I can&#39;t wait to show 
you!&quot;

----------

Aeris heard Tifa before she saw her, her hesitant steps against the wood 
floors, and then the gasps of two others...she turned around quickly to 
see Tifa followed by a couple of other teenagers, eyes wide with wonder.

&quot;Wow...just...damn. Check that out! Flowers!&quot; the boy said. The girl 
gave him a mildly disproving look.

&quot;Don&#39;t use profanity. We&#39;re in a holy place.&quot; Aeris smiled at them, and 
then glanced over at Tifa, who gave her a cheerful wave.

&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind...I brought my friends.&quot;

&quot;Not at all.&quot; Aeris grinned. &quot;So...are you going to introduce me?&quot;

&quot;Oh!&quot; Tifa waved a hand in the direction of the boy. &quot;Biggs, this is 
Aeris, Aeris, this is Biggs. And,&quot; she waved a hand in the girl&#39;s 
direction. &quot;Aeris, this is Jessie. Jessie, Aeris. Jessie&#39;s a genius; 
Biggs said she can build anything.&quot;

Jessie blushed, giving Aeris a polite wave. &quot;I&#39;m not really a genius...&quot;

Biggs shuffled around, uncomfortable, listening to the girls talk like 
they were all old friends. The flowers really were something else, but 
he figured he was intruding. Besides, Jessie didn&#39;t have any friends 
that were girls, and he didn&#39;t want to goof it up for her. He gave the 
three a mock bow and grinned.

&quot;The flowers are really cool, Ms. Aeris, but I figure I should give you 
girls some time alone and all. I&#39;ll be outside if anyone needs me.&quot;

Tifa and Jessie barely acknowledged them, so engrossed in the flowers, 
but Aeris waved good-bye.

&quot;See you, Biggs! And oh, call me Aeris!&quot;

Biggs grinned and slipped out. Flowers in Midgar, who would&#39;ve thought? 
You see something new every day, I guess. Geez, I wonder how long 
they&#39;re going to be in there? I&#39;m hungry...

----------

&quot;So...Aeris, how long have you been doing this? Growing the flowers, I 
mean. It&#39;s really amazing!&quot;

&quot;For as long as I can remember,&quot; Aeris responded softly, smiling gently 
at Jessie. &quot;I remember when I was very young, my mom and I were just 
coming back from Wall Market; we had to do some shopping, and we found 
this church. I...felt something from it, I guess, and I had to come in. 
Poor Mom, she didn&#39;t have any idea what was happening, and I kept 
yelling at the top of my lungs, &#39;Mom, mom, there&#39;s life here!&#39; I guess 
it&#39;s a little weird, that I was so excited about it.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Tifa murmured, patting Aeris&#39; shoulder. &quot;That&#39;s how 
I felt when I first learned how to play the piano, I remember. I had 
always hated it before...but when I finally got the hang of it, it was 
like...magic. Just, the melody streamed out of my hands...I really did 
enjoy it after that.&quot;

Jessie listened to the two talk, feeling a little left out. She didn&#39;t 
really have much to say on the subject, or anything that could compare. 
She stared down at a flower, white with pink edges. She had never seen 
flowers before, and she wondered what this one was called.

&quot;Um...Aeris?&quot;

Aeris looked over at Jessie. &quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;This flower is beautiful. What is it called?&quot;

&quot;Oh...&quot; Aeris looked a little troubled for a moment before responding. 
&quot;It&#39;s a sort of flower that people call a &#39;rose.&#39; The name of that rose 
is Pristine. When you pick it, all of its petals fall off.&quot;

Jessie quickly pulled her hand away from the flower. She had no idea 
that could happen to a flower. Aeris laughed when she noticed, giving 
her a slight smile.

&quot;It&#39;s alright. The flowers are very resilent here. Umm...hmm, would you 
two like to know a bit more about the flowers?&quot;

Both girls nodded their heads eagerly, and Aeris began explaining each 
of the flowers there. Carnations and tulips, lilacs, poinsettia and 
chrysanthemum, orchids, lilies, irises and roses, deep red and pink, 
yellow and lavender, violet and white. The girls seemed very engrossed, 
asking the flower girl all sorts of questions, and Aeris finally felt as 
if she fit in for once. She could show these two her flowers, and they 
would be pleased, happy, instead of afraid and disgusted.

When they left, she handed each girl a flower, a lavender rose for Tifa, 
and a daisy for Jessie. After a moment of thought, she gave them one to 
give Biggs, a large, bright yellow sunflower.

&quot;A long time ago,&quot; she murmured to herself after the two had left, 
&quot;flowers had meanings, each one different from the first. But everyone&#39;s 
forgotten them, now.&quot;

----------

&quot;So, what did you think?&quot; Tifa asked. She twirled her rose around, 
mindful of the thorns. Jessie bit her lip and considered, stifling a 
giggle when she watched Biggs walk past them, the sunflower decorating 
his unruly hair.

&quot;I think she&#39;s very nice. And the flowers are beautiful. How did you 
meet her?&quot;

&quot;Oh! Umm, I was kinda wandering around the slums, and I found the 
church. I went in and found her. I wonder how she does it? You know, 
makes the flowers grow. It&#39;s really fascinating.&quot;

&quot;I think so too,&quot; Jessie murmured, twirling the daisy between her 
fingers. &quot;You think Barret has a vase or something? We should put the 
flowers somewhere they can get water.&quot;

&quot;They probably won&#39;t last very long, without the sun.&quot; Tifa frowned, 
gazing at her rose. It was a really beautiful flower, but she had 
pricked her fingers on the thorns when Aeris first handed it to her.

&quot;You have to be very careful,&quot; Aeris told her, taking her hands in her 
own. Tifa blushed at the memory. She had been really gentle. &quot;The thorns 
are really sharp; so you have to hold the stem in a way that&#39;ll keep you 
from getting hurt. Don&#39;t crush it in your fist. Hold it gently.&quot;

Tifa had followed the instructions, but now she felt her heart sink a 
little. The poor flower; she should have left it where Aeris could take 
care of it. Now it was going to die. Jessie noted her expression and 
gave her a weak smile.

&quot;Umm, well, we can keep them in water until tomorrow, and tonight I&#39;ll 
work on something, a lamp, I guess, to give them the proper sunlight, 
artificial as it is. Then, they won&#39;t die. How does that sound?&quot; She was 
surprised when Tifa nearly bowled her over with a hug.

&quot;Oh! That sounds terrific! Thanks so much! You really are a genius.&quot;

&quot;Umm...thanks for the compliment. And, it&#39;s no problem.&quot; Jessie hugged 
the other girl back. She hadn&#39;t really had many friends like this, and 
Tifa was always so happy...Jessie hadn&#39;t been really happy in a long 
time. Maybe Tifa was a good influence; she seemed to make everyone feel 
better, just being around. It was a nice thought, and it was also what 
made Jessie so happy to help the girl. Besides, she really didn&#39;t want 
her little daisy to die either. It would be a shame; the thing had clung 
on so tenaciously to life in the slums, and Aeris had been so kind, to 
give her the flower. She didn&#39;t have to, they had just met, but the gift 
made her feel warm inside. She wouldn&#39;t let the little flower die, and 
she wouldn&#39;t let Tifa&#39;s rose die either. It would be a shame if that 
happened, and she didn&#39;t want to make Tifa sad. It seemed 
really...wrong, to make someone like Tifa sad. &quot;I&#39;ll get to work on it 
right away, actually. Just...um, you should get something to put the 
flowers in.&quot; She felt odd all of a sudden, with Tifa being so nice, and 
Aeris as well. She almost wanted to cry. It was such a nice feeling, 
being noticed. Biggs noticed her, but not in the way she wanted him to, 
and Wedge didn&#39;t notice much of anything. Her previous relationships 
with people, they only seemed to want to use her for something, but she 
felt none of that here, even though she had just met Tifa and the young 
flower girl. So that Tifa wouldn&#39;t see her crying, she quietly excused 
herself, slipping into the room Barret had set up for both her and Tifa.

Grasping the tiny flower in her small hands, she wept, filled with an 
emotion she had not had felt in years...happiness.

----------

A/N: This chapter went through a lot of issues, what with me destroying 
it, then starting over, then destroying it again, and so on. I&#39;m finally 
finished, and I&#39;m a bit dissatisfied with the lack of action, but then 
again, this story will be focusing on the relationship, moreso than any 
action-type of things. I hope that it didn&#39;t go too slowly for everyone 
else, and I will try my damndest to have the next chapter up a bit 
faster than this one. Thanks everyone, for waiting, and for the reviews, 
and I hope you enjoy this chapter. Another note: I&#39;m pretty sure that 
some of the flowers I mentioned wouldn&#39;t usually grow in an area like 
Aeris&#39; church, but um, chalk it up to her Cetran heritage?
