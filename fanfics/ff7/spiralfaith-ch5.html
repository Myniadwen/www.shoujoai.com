(Saturday, May11)  Amber and Spins Apartment:


            Both Amber and Yuffie have been worrying about them the 
whole time, but they would never show it.  To keep their minds off the 
current situation they watched movies.  But Amber (being so observant) 
notices that it wasn&#146;t work that well, especially for Yuffie.

            &#147;Hey, Yuffie.&#148;

            &#147;What&#148; says Yuffie turning her head right into some 
whipped cream that Amber is spraying at her!  &#147;Hey what&#146;s that for?&#148; 
She yells jumping off of the couch and into the kitchen area.  

            Amber chases her in there, and then stops dead in her 
tracks.  Yuffie was holding the milk jug (with the lid off), smiling 
ear to ear.

            &#147;Time for revenge,&#148; she says throwing milk all over Amber, 
who runs threw it and tackles Yuffie.  She then starts to tickle her, 
until they got face to face. 

            &#147;That was fun,&#148; gasps Yuffie.

            &#145;You want to have more fun?&#148;


Syndicate base:  


            &#147;Okay, you claim you&#146;re not Kerek, but you look just like 
him (except your&#146; eyes).&#148;

            &#147;Spin, calm down,&#148; Yells Tifa.

            &#147;No, I can&#146;t calm down, not until I find out what is going 
on,&#148; points gun at Kerek, &#147;Now, who are you!&#148;

            &#147;I don&#146;t have a name.&#148;

            &#147;Bull shit!&#148;

            &#147;Spin, calm down.&#148;  

            Later that day: Spin and Amber&#146;s Apartment:

            Three hours after they left they return.  The two walk 
threw the halls, up to the apartment door, where Spin gets her keys 
and opens the door, then drags her self in (with Tifa following 
closely).  &#147;Hey, Tifa want something to drink?&#148;

            &#147;Sure.&#148;  Walks into the living area and plops down.  &#147;Hey 
where are Amber and Yuffie?&#148;

            &#147;I don&#146;t know, but they need to learn how to clean up a 
mess!&#148; Sighs Spin, as she makes her way around the spilled milk and 
whip cream.  

            &#147;Thanks,&#148; Tifa except the drink, then takes a sip.  &#147;Hmm, 
wonder where they could be.&#148;  &#147; Hey, you wanna check the bedroom?&#148;

            Spin looks at Tifa curiously.  &#147;Why would they be in 
there?&#148;

            &#147;Yuffie might have gotten scared&#148; Tifa says logically. 
Spin shrugs and gets up then heads to the door to the bedroom. Tifa 
follows her closely, expecting to find nothing.  With a quick turn of 
the knob the door opens.

            Everything looked normal at first then they noticed two 
bulges in the covers on the bed.  Spin walks over to the one on the 
right, and Tifa to the one on the left.  Then they quickly (and 
simultaneously) they pull the cover off to reveal Amber and Yuffie 
(completely naked).

            &#147;What, no no&#148; Spin cries out, &#147;What is going on?&#148;

            Amber gets up to hug Spin, but can&#146;t get a hand on her 
before she runs off.  &#147;Spin&#133;&#148; Every thing fell silent to her, as Spin 
left her life, possibly forever.  Tifa was yelling at Yuffie in the 
background, but she couldn&#146;t hear her, not that she cared though.  The 
one thing that did care about just walked out on her. &#147;No..&#148;


Earlier: The Great Escape: 


            Tifa and Spin had broke in and took the place by storm. 
Not only did they get Ike back, they also got Kerek&#146;s alternative 
personality (Whom the named Zero) with them.  To escape Spin stole a 
bike, and Tifa, Gary, Ike, and Zero rode in the car they came in.

            Spin rode threw the streets toward Northwest High (The 
school Sakura and Tomoyo go to in Remastered), with bullets flying by 
her. She rides right into a car and leaps over it, right into the door 
(Knocking the left one off the hinges), and continues to ride threw 
the main hall (with the enemies car in close pursuit). More bullets 
fly around her as she breaks the other door, and then Ramps off 
another car over a pool (I don&#146;t know if that&#146;s really there, but it 
is now) and the car drives right into it.


Back to Reality:


            &#147;Spin, Spin&#133;., SPIIINNN!&#148; 



Myth-

Myths and legends.

Once real now fake.

Exits only in the world of dreams.

Why?

Because they where forgotten,

Because humanity gave up on them,

Like some have given up on life.
