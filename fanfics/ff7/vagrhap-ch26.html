<a href="../ff7/vagrhap-ch25.html">Back to Part 25</a><pre>&quot;See me comin to town with my soul
Straight down out of the world with my fingers
Holding onto the devil I know
All my troubles&#39;ll hang on your trigger
Take your eyes and your mind from the road
Shoot your mouth if you know where you&#39;re aiming
Don&#39;t forget to pick up what you sow
Talking trash to the garbage around you

See me kickin the door with my boots
Broke down out in a ditch of old rubbish
Snakes and bones in the back of your room
Handing out a confection of venom
Heaven&#39;s drunk from the poison you use
Charm the wolves with the eyes of a gambler
Now I see it&#39;s a comfort to you
Hammer my bones on the anvil of daylight

I won&#39;t give up that ghost
It&#39;s sick the way these tongues are twisted
The good in us is all we know
There&#39;s too much left to taste that&#39;s bitter&quot;

&quot;E-Pro&quot; by Beck

In the cockpit.

Yuffie blinked across at the woman before her, her expression dubious. 
She frowned. &quot;Are you serious?&quot; she asked Lenna, who put on a large pair 
of sunglasses next to her. &quot;They like...&quot; the girl reached up to her 
forehead and made a slicing motion with her finger. &quot;Snikt!!&quot;

Lenna looked at her with one hand on her hip. &quot;Not so much, snikt 
but...&quot; She reached a hand up like Yuffie and made as if she were 
drilling a hole in her head and scooping something out. &quot;Brrm. Slocht!&quot;

Yuffie squirmed on the spot. &quot;Oh my gawd!! That&#39;s so-&quot; she cut herself 
off abruptly as she froze and looked at Lenna with a mortified 
expression, &quot;Uh, I mean...y&#39;know,&quot; she cleared her throat and patted 
Lenna on the shoulder. &quot;That sucks. A lot.&quot;

Lenna smiled at her. She had on a moss green cotton-polyester jacket on 
over a white button up shirt and a pair of brown corduroy pants. Hidden 
beneath the jacket on her side was her holstered firearm. &quot;I don&#39;t think 
I&#39;ve had someone react quite that way.&quot; she said to the ninja.

The teenager squinted at her suspiciously. &quot;In what way?&quot;

The soldier didn&#39;t respond. She simply continued to smile her phantom 
smile. Yuffie, unnerved, sidled toward Tifa, who was busy trying to fit 
her hair into a fisherman&#39;s hat. &quot;Tifa, did you know that-&quot;

&quot;Yep.&quot; the woman said. She caught her tongue between her teeth as she 
pulled her hat over the loose bun.

Yuffie rubbed her neck and looked down at the ground. &quot;Oh.&quot;

Baxter, at the stern, cleared his throat and held up his hand. Today he 
had on a gray zip jacket and a black cotton t-shirt with blue jeans. The 
ninja guessed that his firearm was concealed beneath his jacket as well. 
In his hand, the little black square he had before flashed a 
three-dimensional map into the air again, and everyone gathered near to 
look at it. &quot;We&#39;re entering the city through the militia port. From 
there we&#39;ll blend in with the crowd-so it&#39;s important that Ms. Lockhart 
and Ms. Kisaragi disguise themselves well before we enter the general 
public. This entire operation is being kept secret, so the police are 
unaware of our presence...and on that respect, so are the media.&quot; Baxter 
pointed at Yuffie. &quot;I have a wig for you. A long one to cover your 
hair.&quot;

&quot;A wig!?&quot; Yuffie exclaimed. &quot;That&#39;s bogus, I don&#39;t need one! Just give 
me a hat like Tifa and I&#39;ll be fine!&quot;

&quot;We only have one hat, and we brought that specifically for her. This 
wig should be enough to throw off people&#39;s attention.&quot; Baxter reached 
into the bag at his feet and pulled out a red mop. He held it out to 
Yuffie, who shirked it.

&quot;Gawd, you&#39;re kidding! I&#39;m a carrot top!? It won&#39;t even be convincing!&quot;

Tifa looked at her with feigned disappointment. &quot;But I like red 
heads...&quot;

Henley clapped his hands together and held them up to his cheek as his 
eyes turned dreamy and distant. &quot;You and me both, sister.&quot; he sighed. 
Today he wore a navy blue long sleeve shirt and a black silk vest and 
black khakis, his weapon also concealed beneath.

Baxter snapped his fingers, his slim face contorting in annoyance. &quot;Hey! 
Focus. When we get out there we can&#39;t mess around. You two,&quot; the 
pale-gazed man pointed at Yuffie and Tifa, &quot;Should avoid talking with 
anyone unless it&#39;s absolutely necessary. You&#39;ll need to avoid any 
outward show of affection too. That sort of thing just attracts unwanted 
attention.&quot; He pointed at himself and the other soldiers. &quot;Me, Henley, 
and Lenna will watch your sides. If we somehow get split up, make it to 
Junon Harbor and wait there. Either we&#39;ll meet up again or someone will 
come to get you.&quot; He looked at Yuffie pointedly. &quot;Understand?&quot;

The ninja rolled her eyes. &quot;I get it. Yes, fine. Junon Harbor. I will 
totally go there if any photographers manage to slide in between us.&quot;

Baxter nodded and looked at his team. &quot;You two, come here. I want to 
speak to you in private...&quot;

As the special operative and his companions stepped outside, Tifa turned 
to Yuffie and gripped her shoulder. &quot;You feeling any better?&quot;f

&quot;The lemon and water Lenna gave me is keeping me from tossing, so I&#39;ll 
be good till we get off this damn boat,&quot; Yuffie said as she curled her 
lip at the wig. She held it up to Tifa and shook it suspiciously. &quot;You 
really like red heads?&quot;

Tifa shrugged, a smile on her face. She put on a pair of plastic 
sunglasses as she said cheekily, &quot;Put the wig on and I&#39;ll tell you...&quot;

Yuffie smirked and pulled it over her head.

The Severe Whisper pulled into the dock twenty minutes later, and there 
were calls from the dock workers as Lenna and Baxter tossed them their 
rope. The dock was like the one at Costa Del Sol, but busier. The 
loading ramp came down and Henley called to Tifa and Yuffie, who waited 
at the stern. &quot;Okay ladies! The big moment! Do me proud!&quot;

Yuffie leaned forward and stuck her tongue out at the man, the auburn 
strands of her wig brushing her shoulders as she did so. Tifa shook her 
head and pushed up her plastic shades as they slid down the ridge of her 
nose for the umpteenth time.

&quot;My head itches,&quot; Yuffie hissed as she scratched at the top of her wig. 
Her and the fighter walked to the loading ramp, their bags in their 
hands. Baxter and Lenna waited for them patiently. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to get 
this rag off my head.&quot;

Tifa adjusted her hat. &quot;Well at least your head is getting circulation. 
I&#39;m starting to get a headache from how my head is stuffed into this 
thing with my hair!&quot;

Henley came after them, and the group came down the loading ramp. Baxter 
held up his finger. &quot;Give me a moment to check into the commons here, 
then we&#39;ll go.&quot; He walked toward a building to the far side of the dock. 
Henley stretched. &quot;Finally! Off of that tin can. Maybe things will get 
more interesting now that we&#39;re on land again.&quot;

Tifa tugged at her ear absently. &quot;I wonder what else the media has 
cooked up since we left the Western Continent...do you think they&#39;ve 
bothered the others yet?&quot; The twenty-three-year-old turned to look at 
her companion.

Yuffie raised an eyebrow at her. &quot;What? Are you kidding?&quot; She crossed 
her arms and the muscles in her jaw twitched. &quot;Those worthless slugs 
probably hit them up, first chance they got.&quot; Suddenly, a devious smile 
spread across her face. &quot;But I bet my old man must&#39;ve spat out his tea 
when he heard. Serves him right!&quot; The ninja cried as she wiped harshly 
at her nose with her fist. &quot;He always was a narrow-sighted, 
bugle-tooting, inconsiderate chump...&quot;

Lenna looked up at the top of the walls surrounding the dock. Beyond it, 
all manner of commotion could be heard. &quot;We&#39;ll have to be careful going 
through,&quot; she said in her flat voice. &quot;I&#39;ve heard that Junon has become 
quite dangerous since Shinra left.&quot;

Yuffie looked at the female soldier, then toward the city. A dark frown 
came over her face. &quot;How bad has it got?&quot; she asked slowly. The tone in 
her voice made Tifa look at her curiously.

Lenna shrugged. &quot;Bad. That&#39;s all I&#39;ve heard. Reeve and his organization 
don&#39;t operate here. I think he&#39;s considered helping the city officials, 
but his men are spread thin. He&#39;s going out on a limb just by helping 
you two.&quot;

Yuffie stared at her. She looked pale.

Baxter returned and held up a pink slip. &quot;We&#39;re squared away. Let&#39;s get 
moving.&quot;

As the group followed him, Tifa leaned in and whispered, &quot;What&#39;s the 
matter?&quot;

The ninja looked at her for a moment, then shook her head. &quot;No, it&#39;s 
nothing. I bet we won&#39;t even have to worry about it.&quot;

Tifa&#39;s face hardened. &quot;Worry about what?&quot; she asked flatly.

Yuffie sighed and scratched at her wig again. &quot;Look its just...I got 
into some trouble with some people here. But I doubt we&#39;d see them.&quot;

&quot;What kind of people?&quot;

&quot;Thugs. Just some thugs.&quot;

They came to the gates and the heavy doors slid back-the hum of an 
engine sounding through the air made both women look up. Baxter was at 
the head, Lenna on Yuffie&#39;s side and Henley on Tifa&#39;s. As the city 
greeted them, silence fell over the entire group. Yuffie blinked at the 
sight before her. It had been years since she had last come to the city, 
and though it seemed the same, there was an almost tangent feeling of 
animosity that pressed against her. Her body became stiff as they 
entered the public street and began to make their careful sojourn to 
safety.

The dark, wet pavement; the seedy stares of loiterers; the rowdy calls 
from sailors and city officials off-duty; the chaotic and illegible 
graffiti; the filthy stray cats; the jazz and cigarette smoke that crept 
and curled from open bars...

Junon.

Tifa felt anxiety curl itself in her gut, and she wanted it to be over. 
The city seemed detestable now-an irony that was not lost on her. The 
brunette wanted to ask Yuffie what kind of trouble she had gotten into 
in the past. She knew that the girl&#39;s adolescent shenanigans earned many 
grudges, and her arrogance and flippant attitude was enough to stir up 
ire in the calmest of situations. It was strange how the girl had 
matured to the point of being clear headed enough to exploit a 
situation-or to brush off a potential danger. But Tifa had also come to 
know that when prodded and provoked in just the right way, all progress 
Yuffie had made was tossed to the winds. She wanted to understand this 
side of her, this aspect that seemed sheltered beneath a thick layer of 
nonchalance. Without the understanding, without the reasoning as to why 
the anger came, the sting Tifa felt whenever Yuffie&#39;s ill temper was 
directed her way would hurt tremendously.

But she was afraid to ask. Afraid to hear of the bad things that lurked 
in Yuffie&#39;s shadows...And most of all, afraid to share the bad things 
that lurked in hers. Her self-doubt raked beneath the skin, and Tifa 
hugged herself in a vain attempt to block out the fears.

Yuffie glanced at her through the fiery locks of her wig and briefly 
touched her shoulder. She wanted to do more. She wanted to hold Tifa and 
tell her it would be all right. But that wasn&#39;t allowed-it would defeat 
the purpose of their disguises.

Disgruntled, she settled back into her respective space.

Their quiet trek led them to familiar branches of streets, further from 
the glare and glitter of the ocean and deeper into the dystopian dark 
that blanketed the ex-military base. Yuffie&#39;s concerns were assuaged 
when she saw a group of five policemen march by in formation-their 
rifles out and their masked faces turned resolutely forward. &quot;Lenna&#39;s 
full of it.&quot; Yuffie thought to herself with a faint smile. &quot;Junon may 
have problems, but their police can handle themselves. At any rate, this 
sector looks well protected...the best part of it all is that I think 
we&#39;re close to the elevator that goes down to the Harbor. Yeah...we&#39;re 
totally solid!&quot;

The nineteen-year-old looked to Lenna, then to Tifa. She leaned over to 
whisper something to the fighter when she felt herself bump into 
something warm and hard. Startled, Yuffie reached a hand up to her head 
to make sure her wig was in place, and with searing eyes looked to see 
what she ran into. Baxter had stopped, and his hand hovered near his 
holstered gun beneath his jacket. Lenna and Henley had done the same. 
Tifa and Yuffie exchanged looks. Briefly the ninja looked around her. 
They were in a busy cross street, somewhere near the heart of Junon.

&quot;Is there any particular reason you won&#39;t get out of our way?&quot; Baxter 
said in his low graveled tone.

Yuffie tilted her head to peek around him, and her breath stopped short.

A slim red-headed man with a round face stood almost nose to nose with 
Baxter as he let a thin smile spread across his sunburned face. He had 
on a brown leather coat and a blue silk shirt, with closely-fitted black 
jeans and a pair of mahogany boots. He tilted his head back and spread 
his arms wide as if prepared to envelope the soldier in a hug. &quot;What, 
mate? Have you got a problem with the par-tic-ular choice of route I&#39;ve 
chosen? Don&#39;t you know I never skirt out of the way for nobody?&quot; he said 
in a lilting voice.

Baxter clenched his jaw as he locked gazes with the man. He didn&#39;t 
blink. &quot;Then we&#39;ll just go around you...&quot; he said quietly.

Without ever taking his eyes off him, the special operative stepped to 
the side and tried to walk past. His team mates followed suite, Tifa and 
Yuffie caught between the two other soldiers. The ninja caught sight of 
at least six other men with the red head, and her heart beat quickened 
when she saw the modified pistols holstered on their sides. For a 
moment, it seemed they would pass without trouble-then the red headed 
man stopped Baxter with a slim dry hand. &quot;Oi, hold up a minute friend.&quot; 
he said.

Baxter stopped and gazed at him warningly. &quot;Take your hand off my 
chest.&quot;

&quot;Answer me a question, would you?&quot; The stranger asked, ignoring him. He 
poked a long finger into the blond man&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Can you see? I mean, 
are you blind?&quot;

From behind him, Yuffie and Tifa could see Baxter&#39;s muscles bunch 
beneath his jacket. &quot;I can see fine.&quot; he growled. &quot;These are only 
contacts.&quot;

&quot;Contacts, eh? What, like those contacts people get that makes their 
eyes reflective-like mirrors?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; The soldier said primly.

The red headed man chuckled, and patted the top of Baxter&#39;s head. &quot;Cos I 
was about to say, it seems like the blind leading the blind here! I 
mean, bloody hell, is this some sort of caravan?&quot; His lips curled to 
reveal filed canines. He looked to Yuffie and pointed at her slowly. 
&quot;You got a reddy with you? Eh? She a natural reddy? Y&#39;know how these 
dames are, mate. They&#39;ll swear till Gilgamesh comes that they&#39;re o&#39; 
natch-oo-ral a&#39;fore they say otherwise.&quot;

He looked at Yuffie, and the girl winced beneath his hot searing gaze. 
&quot;Are you in the &#39;otherwise&#39; category, sweetheart?&quot; he drawled.

Tifa tensed and her gaze darkened. &quot;If you touch her...I&#39;ll make you 
regret it.&quot; she thought fiercely.

&quot;Oi, Otter, don&#39;t these two flowers seem familiar?&quot; One of the lackeys 
wheezed.

The man called Otter rubbed his chin and stepped back. His eyes widened. 
&quot;Rotgut, why I think you&#39;re right! This girl does look familiar!&quot;

Baxter shook his head and pushed Yuffie behind him. For the first time 
since she had met him, the girl didn&#39;t make any objections. &quot;We&#39;re only 
out for a walk. Let us through.&quot; the man said quietly. Behind him, 
Yuffie squeezed her eyes shut and tried to stop her body trembling. Tifa 
put an arm around her shoulders and squeezed her.

Otter laughed and tried to look around Baxter. &quot;Yuffster! Yuffster is 
that you, love!? The little ninja that could! Oh, look at how much 
you&#39;ve grown! Are those tits Isee through that poor disguise of yours, 
or are they part of the get up?&quot; The red headed man cried jovially.

Baxter shoved him away roughly. &quot;Get out of here slug!&quot; He barked.

Abruptly, the sounds of guns loading pierced the air, and the soldier 
found himself facing down six gun barrels. On either side of him, Lenna 
and Henley had drawn their weapons as well.

Before anyone could do anything, however, Yuffie shoved her way forward 
so that she stood between Baxter and Lenna. Tifa, frightened at her 
lover&#39;s sudden daring and feeling compelled to be involved, slid in next 
to Baxter, her hands gripping the ninja&#39;s arm.

&quot;Bastard!&quot; Yuffie bit out, the deep shade of scarlet her face took 
unusual for her pearly complexion. &quot;Just let us through, Otter, we don&#39;t 
want any trouble!&quot;

Baxter looked at her, his white eyes narrowed to slits as he bared his 
teeth. &quot;You know this man?&quot; he asked fiercely.

The teenager glared at him briefly. &quot;Of course I do, stupid!&quot; She turned 
her eyes on Otter and his men, her fists clenched. &quot;But that isn&#39;t the 
issue now, is it soldier boy?&quot;

Otter winked cheekily at the ninja. &quot;Did we blow your cover? Are we 
inconveniencing you, princess?&quot; He scowled in disdain as he pointed at 
Tifa. &quot;You trying to make a run for it with your lady love, here? Funny 
shit you read in the papers, Yuffster... Gross stuff. It made me want to 
vomit. I mean hell, love, you can&#39;t be serious. You can&#39;t be.&quot;

&quot;You pig. You knew who we were the entire time. You were just toying 
with us, weren&#39;t you? Just what are trying to pull here, huh?&quot; Yuffie&#39;s 
lip curled to a sneer. &quot;Beat it, Otter...I mean it! We don&#39;t need to 
fight! What would your uncle say if he knew you were so far out of your 
territory?&quot;

&quot;Territory?&quot; The auburn haired man blinked at her, then let out a 
booming guffaw. His men laughed with him, and Yuffie&#39;s blood drained at 
their confidence. Otter jabbed a thumb at her as he turned to his 
companions and chuckled, &quot;&#39;Territory!&#39; &#39;Territory,&#39; she says!&quot; His 
laughter died away and he gazed wildly at her, the bangs of his outgrown 
hair falling into his serpent like-eyes. &quot;Look at the little ninja 
telling me what&#39;s what in my own city!! You think you know better, 
princess? You been gone three years and you think you know better than 
your ol&#39; buddy Otter?&quot; The man&#39;s emerald eyes flashed something 
sinister, and his lips parted to show his sharp teeth. He reached into 
his coat and pulled out a pistol. &quot;Yuffster...&quot; he pointed his gun at 
Yuffie&#39;s head. &quot;You don&#39;t know what you&#39;ve gotten yourself into...&quot; 
Otter pulled the trigger.

The sharp noise shot through her heart and stole the voice from her 
throat. Pain. Hot red pain that flowed down her neck and onto her 
clothes. The wig fell from atop her head as the crowd around them 
scattered in a panic. She knocked into Lenna&#39;s body, her face shocked.

A body hit the dirty cement.

A man in his late fifties with a gray mustache and a bald spot lay on 
his back. Blood did not pool around his head, but the breath stopped 
short of his lips and his limbs went lax. The bullet had ricocheted 
inside his skull, destroying his brain.

Chaos blossomed like a bruise.

Tifa&#39;s quick push against Yuffie saved the girl, but caused her to fall 
back against Baxter. The man caught her easily, and with weapon drawn, 
fired back at the criminals before them. He shoved the fighter behind 
him as Henley fired as well. The policemen they had passed by came 
rushing toward them, rifles in hand. Two of Otter&#39;s men fell to the 
ground, the man himself instead dashed forward, his bravado knowing no 
bounds. Baxter pulled Tifa with him roughly as he broke into the 
panicked stream of people around them. But Otter wasn&#39;t after them.

Before Yuffie could seek the missing cartilage blasted from her right 
ear, an iron grip came to snatch her arm and drag her away. Dazedly, the 
ninja saw Tifa vanish among the frenzied current of strangers. She was 
going in the opposite direction. The civilians screamed and ran 
maniacally-like frightened insects startled from their somnambulism. She 
saw the fighter&#39;s eyes flash in fear, heard her own heartbeat pound in 
her ears like a terrified rabbit&#39;s.

Yuffie&#39;s legs recovered from their shocked clumsiness and she leaned 
back against the one who pulled her as she dug her heels in. &quot;No! Tifa! 
I can&#39;t leave her!&quot; Yuffie screamed. Her eyes were turned in the 
direction she last saw her lover...but the next thing that greeted her 
eyes ceased her struggles and had her running more energetically with 
her would-be savior. Otter charged after them, his mouth set in an ugly 
snarl. The girl looked to see who led her on. Lenna did not look back at 
her. She led artfully and adroitly through the madness, her body tilted 
forward in determination.

It was evasive escape. Fleeing. Retreating.

Running away.

Lenna didn&#39;t stop even when Otter shot at them again. The bullet flashed 
past and Yuffie let out a low cry as her eyes widened as far as they 
possibly could. Blood spray. Another body fell-this time a young woman 
with a bag of groceries. Lenna skirted her prone body without a moment&#39;s 
hesitation and instead dragged Yuffie into a narrow street. Here the 
ground was uneven and gravelly. An open apartment door left by a tenant 
provided an easy haven as the female operative lead the ninja into the 
unknown space.

A hoarse shout cut the air as an old woman-unable to move quickly due to 
her wheelchair-shielded her face in morbid fear as Lenna and Yuffie 
zipped through her simple home to the tenant building&#39;s stairwell. They 
hurried up the stairs to the third floor where Lenna stopped before a 
door and with a grunt, kicked it in without trouble. A middle aged man 
in his underwear screamed and ran into another room as the soldier cut 
through his living room and opened his window. It went up high enough 
that she could half-stand on the window sill and look out if she wished. 
She took off her sunglasses and looked back at Yuffie. &quot;We&#39;re going to 
jump to the roof of the next building.&quot; she said in a steady tone.

Before the ninja could respond, a siren wailed throughout the building 
and echoed down the streets. The girl&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Oh crap, the cops 
initiated the-&quot;

&quot;Which is why you need to jump quickly.&quot; Lenna cut in.

Junon was previously a military base, and as such had a special security 
program for especially serious scenarios-the best example being when 
Emerald Weapon attacked the city. Buildings and streets had a lock down 
feature that-when implemented-prevented the exit and entrance of any 
unauthorized personnel. Doors and windows were sealed by a thick bullet 
proof barrier. Meanwhile, streets were further protected by large metal 
blockades to prevent the movement of enemies deeper into the city. This 
divided the areas into smaller-more manageable sectors. The siren was as 
a warning for civilians to get out of the streets and into their 
homes...also to step clear of the barriers paths. The security measure 
did not stop if something was in its way. Countless pets and children 
died in this gruesome fashion, and the people of Junon learned quickly 
that they needed to move when the security siren went off.

Yuffie grit her teeth, and with a severe look toward her flat-toned 
companion she briefly looked out the window to see where she would land. 
The fall would be about ten feet, and the space between the two 
buildings had to be approximately six feet. With thin lips, Yuffie took 
a few steps back and breathed in deep. She dug the ball of her foot into 
the carpet as she pushed forward in a sprint and leaped out the window. 
The ninja saw the rooftop rush to greet her, and she bent her knees and 
rolled when she landed. She stumbled out of the way and looked back in 
time to see Lenna jump after her. She landed perfectly and stood without 
problem, her pistol drawn. The wail of the security sirens blared all 
around them.

At the window, Yuffie saw Otter appear. He stuck his arm out the window, 
pistol in hand, but all at once there was a thunderous &#39;shlack&#39; as the 
locks that held down the window barriers disengaged. Alarmed he pulled 
his hand back, and as the security barriers shot up to block the 
windows, the teenager caught one last look of intense hate before 
Otter&#39;s face disappeared behind the seven inch thick metal.

Yuffie leaned against the wall and felt her ear, felt the blood trail 
and trickle along her jaw. The droplets fell like little rubies from her 
chin and stained her shirt. The bullet grazed her ear, and it stung 
incredibly. She knew the injury was minor, but a small chunk was taken 
out of her ear forever. The vanity in her mourned the missing flesh. The 
warrior in her-the greater part, or at least she liked to think it 
was-thanked Leviathan she was still alive.

She thought of the man who took the bullet in her place, dead between 
the eyes. She squeezed her eyes and tried to block out the image of his 
corpse being trampled by the panicked crowd.

Her breath came short. Her heart rammed against her rib cage unbearably. 
With a lip that trembled, Yuffie sank to the dirty ground, the brick 
wall she leaned against scraping against her back as she went down. &quot;How 
did...&quot; she reached a shaking hand to her ashen face and covered her 
mouth. Bile threatened to erupt.

Lenna, her eyes focused toward the two streets at either end of the 
alley, holstered her gun. She pulled Yuffie to her feet with one hand, 
and the girl didn&#39;t offer any protest. She seemed like a marionette 
doll.

&quot;Who was the man that shot at us? Why didn&#39;t you tell us there would be 
a threat like this?&quot; the soldier asked quietly. They re-entered the 
street at break-neck speed. Yuffie trailed behind her, her face blank 
and her eyes glassy. &quot;Yuffie?&quot; Lenna looked at the ninja.

&quot;I didn&#39;t think anything would happen.&quot; Yuffie said shakily. Her eyes 
focused again. &quot;Junon may have been a military base, but it was also 
famous for having its share of crooks. It was so bad that pirates 
literally made it their place of operation.&quot; she shook her head and 
turned to look at the people around her. They didn&#39;t seem confused, but 
afraid and angry. They wandered in the middle of the streets and shouted 
at the windows, which were shut up by barriers. Their loved ones were 
inside. &quot;The gangs that worked here had an agreement not to pull stunts 
in certain places, like near or at the docks. It was bad for business. 
Attracted attention. The place we were at was one of them, but...&quot; 
Yuffie looked around. The shock began to wear off, and with her regain 
of composure her mind worked out diligently the problem set before her. 
&quot;It&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve been to Junon. It&#39;s changed so much. Shinra 
doesn&#39;t run things here anymore.&quot; Yuffie&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;I&#39;d hate to 
say it, but this city&#39;s gotten worse without them.&quot;

&quot;We need to get to the harbor. The others&#39;ll be there.&quot; Lenna said.

Yuffie pulled her arm away from the soldier sharply. &quot;No.&quot;

The female operative stared. The teenager gestured around her. &quot;Look at 
this Lenna! Look at these people! They&#39;re suffering because of a mistake 
I made in the past! ...Because of a mistake I made now! Baxter had 
suggested going somewhere different from Junon, but I...I wasn&#39;t 
thinking clearly. Now one idiot goes starting trouble and look where we 
are! This makes no sense! I can&#39;t just run!!&quot;

&quot;And what about Tifa?&quot; Lenna asked with her arms crossed. &quot;You need to 
be there for her.&quot;

&quot;These guys didn&#39;t hesitate to shoot in a crowded and heavily guarded 
area. Didn&#39;t you see?&quot; Yuffie&#39;s face grew grave. &quot;The pirates control 
the city now. You think Otter&#39;s really going to stay trapped in that 
building until the cops find him? These stupid barriers won&#39;t keep him 
and his goons from moving around! But they&#39;ll keep us from moving 
around! Tifa&#39;s in danger unless I can stop them.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s a grown woman. She knows how to fight. You don&#39;t need to be her 
knight, y&#39;know.&quot;

&quot;I know she can fight, but she isn&#39;t as sharp as she used to be! Her 
stamina is especially shot, I&#39;d imagine running away would&#39;ve been 
enough to zap her energy.&quot;

&quot;So what are you thinking? You want to wage a war with a gang of 
criminals powerful enough to control an entire city?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be stupid, a ninja doesn&#39;t work that way. We attack the problem 
at its one weak source.&quot;

&quot;And what&#39;s that?&quot;

Yuffie sighed and looked down at her biker boots. With one last look 
around her, she turned and began to walk past Lenna toward the end of 
the street. The other woman followed. At the street sign, Yuffie looked 
up and nodded. &quot;Lucky break.&quot; she said to herself. She pointed to her 
right, down the new street. &quot;Her home should be down this way.&quot;

&quot;Whose home?&quot; Lenna asked.

&quot;Otter&#39;s sister&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;...The sister of the man who shot at us? Is that really wise? What if 
she turns us over to her brother?&quot;

&quot;She won&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;Because she&#39;s different.&quot;

&quot;...Your tone of voice alone gives me reason to find complaint with 
this.&quot;

Yuffie licked her lips nervously. She ran a hand through her hair and 
stared at the people she passed as she continued walking. &quot;Audrey is 
crazy.&quot; Yuffie hooked her thumbs into her back pockets. &quot;She also 
happens to hate me. Like, a lot.&quot;

Lenna raised an eyebrow, her blank expression forming one that could be 
construed as judgmental. &quot;And she can help us how? If she hates you 
then-&quot;

&quot;Look she&#39;s the only one who can talk Otter down, all right!?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m in charge of keeping you from getting killed.&quot; Lenna grabbed 
Yuffie&#39;s arm and pulled her back roughly. Her soulless eyes bored into 
the ninja&#39;s, who glared at her angrily. &quot;In my opinion, this will only 
lead to trouble.&quot;

Yuffie wrenched away from Lenna. &quot;Never touch me like that again, 
zombie.&quot;

Lenna gazed steadily at her. &quot;You&#39;d risk everything on the off-chance 
that this girl will help us? What about Tifa?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t use her as leverage, damn you! I&#39;m doing this for her.&quot;

&quot;How crazy is this girl, anyway?&quot;

Yuffie paused. &quot;Is there some kinda scale I&#39;m supposed to go by to get 
it through to you? One to ten? One being the lowest?&quot; she spread her 
arms out wide and leaned forward a little to shout. &quot;Try one million, 
trillion, gazillion okay!? She&#39;s NUTS!! She&#39;s insane! She played chicken 
with cars, put bleach in people&#39;s drinks, and bit people so hard they 
bled-and when she was ESPECIALLY out there, she put a noose around her 
neck and sat out in the rain till she got sick! She&#39;s crazy, Lenna!! 
CRAZY!! Kookoo, loopy, totally backwards! But you wanna know what?&quot; 
Yuffie pointed in the direction they had come from. &quot;She&#39;s different 
from those guys! She was the only one in her family who dreamed of being 
something other than a crook, all right? She dreamed of getting away 
from them all and living in a cottage by the sea. She dreamed of 
becoming a scientist to help make the environment better and to help the 
animals she loved! She&#39;s nuts because of the hard life she&#39;s lived, and 
the depression and the frustration and the fear she feels living in a 
world where sleeping with a gun underneath your pillow is advisable! If 
I can appeal to the good side in her, if I can just get her to forgive 
me and...and help then...&quot; Yuffie trailed away. She narrowed her eyes 
and pointed at Lenna. &quot;Hey, wait a second, I don&#39;t have to explain jack 
to you, lady! I do what I want all right?&quot;

&quot;If we don&#39;t work together we&#39;ll get killed. I promise I&#39;ll help you if 
you&#39;ll only get things to make sense to me.&quot; Lenna said evenly.

Yuffie sucked at her teeth for a moment. Then she threw up her hands, 
&quot;All right, fine. The way I see it, you know nothing of the tunnels or 
the secret passageways that run through this city, right? Shinra didn&#39;t 
even use those tunnels five years ago. They were too confusing, too 
inefficient. They stopped making maps about the layout and didn&#39;t even 
mention them to new recruits stationed here. There is no way you can 
navigate them, even if you have heard of them.&quot;

Lenna crossed her arms and nodded her head slowly, &quot;Go on...&quot;

&quot;But y&#39;see, Audrey knows the tunnels like the back of her hand. She 
knows how to get in and out of the different sectors even when all of 
this security BS is going on. I know so. She took me through them once 
when Shinra shacked up because of some kinda riot.&quot;

&quot;And what about the fact that she hates you?&quot;

&quot;She may hate me...&quot; Yuffie said with a deep scowl. &quot;But she isn&#39;t a 
murderer. She doesn&#39;t have it in her.&quot;

&quot;Someone who&#39;s capable of putting bleach into people&#39;s drinks is 
incapable of murder?&quot;

&quot;Someone who&#39;s incapable of feeling is capable of gaging the moral 
mettle of others?&quot; Yuffie returned hotly.

Lenna blinked at her. &quot;...I didn&#39;t know you had the word &#39;mettle&#39; in 
your vocabulary...&quot;

Yuffie gave her a look of disbelief. &quot;Gawd!! Do I have the word 
&#39;literary idiot&#39; printed on my forehead??&quot; She pointed a finger 
suspiciously at the woman. &quot;Tifa told you that story about how I 
misunderstood the word &#39;paternal&#39; huh?&quot;

The female soldier shook her head. &quot;I just didn&#39;t peg you as a 
logophile.&quot;

&quot;A logo-what?&quot;

&quot;Never mind...okay, before we lose more time, just tell me what the 
story is between you and these people so that I&#39;m not left in the dark.&quot;

&quot;You mean you&#39;ll help me?&quot;

&quot;Well how can&#39;t I? You used the word &#39;mettle&#39; in your argument, after 
all.&quot;

&quot;...Okay, now that&#39;s just irritating. I can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re joking or 
not. ...Uh, you can joke around, right?&quot;

&quot;I suppose so, yes.&quot;

Yuffie rubbed at her face. &quot;Look, when we meet Audrey can you refrain 
from speaking? She&#39;ll definitely blow us off if you open your mouth too 
much.&quot;

&quot;All right.&quot; Lenna crossed her arms and shifted her weight to one foot. 
&quot;So. The story, then?&quot;

&quot;Do you really think we have time? Can&#39;t you just understand that me and 
this girl used to be friends and in the end something bad happened to 
break us up?&quot;

The female soldier shook her head, her long locks swishing like a cat&#39;s 
idle tail as she did so. &quot;Not even in the most dire of times do military 
forces overlook the importance of a good briefing. If you want me to 
really be your back up-give me all the details.&quot;

&quot;Meh, all right...you asked for it.&quot; Yuffie sat down on the sidewalk. 
Her ears picked up an old man crying and though it unnerved her, she 
turned her head to look. He seemed to blubber something about his dead 
dog.

She looked away and tried to ignore the other restless citizens.

&quot;Okay, well...back when I was in Wutai,&quot; the ninja began, &quot;I used to 
steal from tourists and soldiers who vacationed there. I did this for a 
while, and gathered up a bit of cash and materia from it-but it still 
wasn&#39;t enough for a rebellion-plus my dad knew what I was doing and 
always tried to stop me. I knew I had to get out of there and into the 
world if I was going to do any good. Then one day these pirates came...&quot; 
Yuffie smiled sardonically. &quot;Pirates. People may not believe it but 
there are bona fide pirates that still terrorize the seas. This ugly 
bunch I found had a load of materia on their ship along with these 
really wicked weapons. But silly me, I didn&#39;t know they were pirates at 
the time. Their ship seemed a pretty solid transport and a good mark all 
at once, so the night they left I sneaked on board, not knowing what I 
was signing myself up for. I sorta hoped my sea sickness wouldn&#39;t cause 
me any trouble, because it was bad even then, but I was wrong. I 
couldn&#39;t get to a bathroom or a sink or anything. I threw up on the 
floor of the cargo bay. The mess and the stench let the crew know there 
was a stowaway. It only took them five minutes to find me, sick and 
miserable, behind some crates in a corner.&quot;

The ninja looked at the woman, half-expecting a question or statement of 
some sort. Lenna remained quiet, however, her flat stare punctuated only 
by the occasional blink. Yuffie raised an eyebrow and continued with the 
corners of her mouth down-turned a fraction, &quot;It was super scary. They 
debated on what to do with me. I was at least smart enough then not to 
tell them who I was, because I knew it would lead in some sort of ransom 
BS and those never turned out good anyway-but even then I couldn&#39;t keep 
my mouth shut from blurting out every other stupid thing that popped 
into my head. After I rattled out every possible insult I knew both in 
the Common language and Wutainese, I finally shouted out, &#39;Let me join 
you!&#39; ...And the bastards, they laugh.

&quot;...But as luck would have it, there were two other kids on board. Their 
names were Otter and Audrey. They were brother and sister and their 
uncle was the captain of the ship. When they saw me they argued to keep 
me alive so long as I played with them. I was only...what? Nine? Ten? 
Audrey was the same age as me, and Otter was a year younger. At first I 
was sorta snotty and stand-offish with them...but y&#39;know, they saved my 
life and seemed genuinely interested in me. We played, and after a while 
I forgot that I was ever in danger. I stayed with them in Junon. It was 
with their family that I learned how criminals worked-how real 
operations were run. I was good at hiding and stealing, but my greater 
skills I learned with them. No one was a better thief than 
Audrey...except maybe me. She was super smart, y&#39;know? Like really 
smart. She liked reading about brainy stuff and had a real soft spot for 
animals. She hated Shinra as much as I did, and we became fast friends. 
I think after a year with them, I went off on my own for the first time. 
Out, into the woods, where travelers were most vulnerable. But I&#39;d 
always go back to Junon after a few weeks or a few months. When I turned 
sixteen, though...

&quot;See, every now and again Audrey&#39;s uncle Mack would come up with a big 
job. Since me, Otter, and Audrey were so good at what we did, he usually 
let us help. One day he comes to me and tells me he has an important 
role for me. He tells me that if I don&#39;t succeed the whole thing falls 
apart. I was stoked, of course-my ego got in the way and I didn&#39;t stop 
long enough to consider the position I would find myself in.

&quot;What he wanted me to do was to go into this bank on the Eastern side 
and hide inside of it until it closed. Then at night, after I disabled 
all the security cameras and sensors, I&#39;d let everyone else in. Here&#39;s 
the problem: Mack never entirely warmed up to me. Maybe it was because I 
was from Wutai, or maybe he just didn&#39;t care for my attitude...either 
way the only reason he let me hang around was because I got him lots of 
cash. If he ever found out that I was the daughter of the ruler of 
Wutai, he&#39;d have probably screwed me over for a quick gain.

&quot;This job I was doing...well, they needed a scapegoat. And I guess I was 
it. With something like this, they needed to throw something at 
authorities to stall them long enough to cover their tracks. The bank 
was the third biggest in the city, and while that may not sound like 
beans to you, it was plenty for an outfit like Mack&#39;s. Plus, the 
security was mad for it. I mean, come on-this was a SHINRA operated 
bank! I had to squeeze into an air duct for six hours in the women&#39;s 
bathroombefore I could stick my head out again, and when I did, I saw 
that the entire floor was rigged with lasers that-when interrupted-set 
off machine gun turrets set into the walls and also alerted Shinra 
troops nearby.

&quot;I managed to disable all of that junk and let everyone in. The last 
step in my part was to disable the lock on the safe, which was remotely 
controlled from another room. Well it seemed simple enough-bust in, flip 
a switch, and voila! Instant gratification, right? Ha, I wish...the room 
had an automatic lock down that-if you were an authorized personnel-you 
could easily get out of...but Mack purposefully didn&#39;t give me the code 
to turn the damn thing off! I was locked in there. So him and his 
buddies got off scott-free while the Shinra goons came in to find me 
sitting on the carpet with a sore face and an even sorer pride. The 
soldiers were easy to escape after they got me out, but I was SO 
pissed!! I wanted revenge, and I saw my chance when I heard that Mack 
and his pirate gang were gonna pull another heist-one with a crap load 
of materia. I decided it better to go back to Mack like nothing had 
happened and offer my services again.

&quot;When he saw me, he was surprised and kinda annoyed. He didn&#39;t want me 
to work on the job. I guess he knew I&#39;d screw him over...but Audrey. 
Poor Audrey.&quot; Yuffie paused and shook her head. She looked at the man 
who cried for his dog and bit her lip. Lenna knelt down next to her, her 
eyes lidded as she waited patiently for Yuffie to continue. The ninja 
spoke again, but with a subdued tone. &quot;Audrey argued that if I didn&#39;t 
get to help, than she wouldn&#39;t help either-and Mack needed her. He was 
stubborn though. He held out for three days before he finally agreed to 
let me in on the last minute. I guess he figured doing that would make 
it harder for me to devise a plan against him. He was wrong.

&quot;The job was a lot easier than the last: swipe a shipment of materia 
incoming from Midgar and take it back to a safe house down shore. At 
first it went to plan-I was with the first team that raided the boat. 
Mack thought the sea sickness would do me in...also he didn&#39;t want me 
anywhere near the money in the heist&#39;s final stages. The loot was 
transferred from our ship at some dirt island where it was given to an 
even smaller boat and sent back to the main land.

&quot;Audrey had once told me how thievery was like magic. All you had to do 
was distract a person-and with the right tools-you could do anything. 
Well I did it. Till this day, it was the best stunt I ever pulled. 4 
tons of materia, gone. Within minutes.&quot; Despite herself, Yuffie smirked. 
&quot;Thanks to some well placed, well timed gravity, haste, and confusion 
spells I switched the crates at the dirt island. Then, back at Junon, 
after everyone had gone, I hid the stuff in Junon Harbor somewhere with 
the mind to come back for it when it was time to fight Shinra. I paid 
some guys to help me move it all-I didn&#39;t tell &#39;em what was in the 
crates and they knew better than to ask.

&quot;Mack was furious...and he blamed Audrey for what happened. When Mack 
gets angry like that-a price is paid. She had hoped to someday get out 
of the business and do her own thing-y&#39;know go to school to become an 
environmentalist or a veterinarian or something...but because of what I 
did, that became an impossibility. He took the money she saved for 
school and essentially obligated her-under threats and guilt-to stay and 
continue working as a pirate and thief.&quot;

Yuffie dug the heels of her palms into her eyes. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean for her 
to get hurt, but she did. Before I left the area, she found where I was 
hiding out in the woods and stood over me while I was sleeping. She had 
a knife. I woke up just as Audrey placed the blade to my throat. I thank 
Leviathan I had the foresight to set up smoke traps before I went to 
bed. I set it off and she was startled back. I made my getaway and that 
was the last time I saw her. When I went out deeper into the Junon 
forests, I ran into Avalanche. After that, it was, y&#39;know, history. With 
Cloud&#39;s group, I didn&#39;t fear going back to Junon. They were powerful-not 
even Mack would want to mess with them. Compared to those guys, him and 
the others were just thugs scrambling to make ends meet. Plus they 
didn&#39;t control the city then-they had other gangs to worry about. So 
when I came back to the city and entered other territories, I was always 
left alone. &#39;The enemy of my enemy is my friend&#39; sort of thing.&quot;

&quot;But now,&quot; Lenna finally spoke, and her azure eyes were glazed with 
contemplation. Slowly her face turned upward toward the burgeoning sky. 
&quot;Now the situation is different. Avalanche isn&#39;t with you. They control 
the city.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Yuffie said with a nod as she lifted her head and glanced 
around. She looked at Lenna out of the corner of her eye. &quot;So that&#39;s the 
whole story-that&#39;s where I stand. And Tifa&#39;s in danger now that they 
know we&#39;re together. They&#39;ll try to hurt her to get to me. I can&#39;t let 
them do that.&quot;

&quot;You really should&#39;ve said something when we came.&quot; The female soldier 
said this plaintively.

The teenage girl ruffled her hair and let out a growl. &quot;Look, I didn&#39;t 
know, okay!? I&#39;ve been out of the crime world for years now-Mack&#39;s 
domination of Junon was beyond my network of info! But, we&#39;ve got one 
possible solution... If I can make things right with Audrey, she might 
help us. See, I mean, I could try and just bribe Mack with what&#39;s left 
of the materia stash down in the harbor-but he&#39;ll most likely just take 
the loot and kill me and Tifa anyways. Criminals can&#39;t really be bought 
with money-a lot of what fuels them is their reputation and protecting 
it. Audrey&#39;s my only way past that.&quot;

&quot;Okay. I guess your reasoning is good enough.&quot; Lenna said with a nod.

Yuffie smiled in relief. &quot;Thanks...Now let&#39;s just hope she&#39;s home. I 
doubt she wouldn&#39;t be, though-someone has to run the gift shop during 
the day.&quot;

&quot;Gift shop?&quot;

Tifa&#39;s face tilted slowly back, the measurement of her awe growing with 
every gain in millimeter. Before her was the monstrous cold barricade 
that separated families and friends and hopes all together. She pressed 
a shaking hand to the stoic metal, and felt a chill run up her spine as 
she imagined all the hurt this abomination of human intellect had 
wrought in the name of &#39;safety&#39;. She set herself opposite this stark 
mirror and saw her own situation reflected back at her.

&quot;This barrier,&quot; Tifa said quietly, her face ashen and strands of hair 
still damp from the sweat that had stained her skin in her panic. &quot;When 
will it go down?&quot;

Baxter and Henley stood on either side of her, their hands on their hips 
and pondering expressions on their faces.

&quot;Perhaps in an hour or two,&quot; Baxter said gravelly, his inhuman gaze 
shadowed by the behemoth that stood before him. &quot;The city officials also 
have the authority to override the lock down, but that happening now is 
unlikely.&quot;

Tifa bowed her head and let her hand fall back to her side. &quot;What are we 
going to do? At this rate, we can&#39;t look for Yuffie and Lenna, let alone 
get to Junon Harbor...&quot;

Henley thumped a hand on his chest and winked at her. &quot;Never fear my 
dear! Henley the great is about to put his superb skills to use!&quot;

Tifa gave him a bemused stare. &quot;Sorry?&quot; she said with a frown.

Baxter crossed his arms and turned to look at the people behind them. 
The atmosphere was tense and unhappy. They would have to watch their 
backs. &quot;Henley is a master hacker.&quot; the special operative explained. &quot;He 
can get to the Junon City Control Center and lower the barriers.&quot;

&quot;But won&#39;t that be dangerous?&quot; Tifa asked with a glance at the 
brown-haired hacker.

&quot;Henley-despite his loud mouth-is very good at infiltration. Our only 
obstacles of course are these barriers to begin with...&quot; Baxter sighed 
and looked at his male comrade. &quot;We&#39;ll have to find a way to get you to 
the Center and fast.&quot;

Henley pointed at his leader&#39;s pocket. &quot;Check your virtual map...are 
there any hidden routes we can use?&quot; he asked.

Baxter pulled out the device, and with a furtive look at those near 
them, turned his body again so as to block the view of anyone else. A 
projection blossomed from the square-shaped pad he held in his hand. 
&quot;The only route I see is through the official paths used by city police. 
They&#39;ve got three entryways in this sector-but I&#39;d imagine they&#39;re all 
guarded both by man and machine.&quot;

Henley nodded, his normally upturned mouth set in a somber line. &quot;So we 
have the means, but not the way. We&#39;ll be like sitting ducks here...&quot;

Baxter sighed and put the electronic device away. &quot;Yes, given our recent 
encounter, my guess is that either those thugs were incredibly 
stupid...or knew exactly what they were doing. If the latter is the 
case, then these barriers serve no problem to them at all.&quot; The hardness 
about his face softened. &quot;...But on that note, there might be other ways 
around these barriers. Ways that not even the police know of.&quot;

Tifa rubbed her arm anxiously and looked between her two guardians. 
&quot;What are we going to do?&quot; she asked in a low voice. She thought of 
Yuffie, and how they were split by panic and bullets. Her eyes burned 
and she desperately hoped the ninja was all right.

Baxter gestured to Henley. &quot;Check around for any possible ways out of 
here. I&#39;ll look around too. Tifa, stay with me.&quot; The other soldier gave 
a short salute and went off down the street. Tifa turned to Baxter and 
placed a hand on her hip.

&quot;What about Yuffie? And Lenna? Are we going to try and find them?&quot; she 
asked.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about her. She is strong.&quot; The man began to walk in the 
opposite direction Henley went. They skirted a group of arguing men and 
women. All of them shouted at once so that the fighter couldn&#39;t make out 
what they were saying. She gazed at them with a sense of apprehension 
and shame. In the worst of moments...was this what most people were 
reduced to? Where was the underlying strength? The inherent goodness?

Was panic and disaster all that was needed to break apart the strongest 
relationships?

Tifa&#39;s eyes turned to the ground. Then her eyes flickered up to stare at 
the muscled back of Baxter, who dutifully searched for any possible hint 
of a secret passage. She understood what he was doing. He was canceling 
out places due to reasoning. &quot;This place can&#39;t be where its set-patrols 
go past here all the time, it&#39;d be like popping up into a hornet&#39;s nest; 
this spot isn&#39;t it either, an energy conduit is fixed into the 
wall-wires run all along beneath this road, and the road itself is 
always damp-it&#39;s a hazard; this spot isn&#39;t it because the drug addicts 
infest this area, and while they may not look it, they can be a great 
risk for blabbing out your secret.&quot;

The woman tried to do the same but found her mind was much too 
preoccupied. After a moment, Tifa gave up and looked at Baxter with a 
searching gaze. &quot;...You don&#39;t like her that much, do you? Yuffie I 
mean.&quot; she said, voice slightly raised so as to be heard over the 
commotion around them.

The soldier didn&#39;t turn his head. &quot;We really shouldn&#39;t waste energy 
talking about the unimportant.&quot; he said flatly.

Tifa scowled. &quot;I think its important. I think it matters. We&#39;re stuck 
here until we can get out anyway...just what is it that makes your 
patience so short with her?&quot;

The man paused and looked at her over his shoulder. &quot;I don&#39;t know. We 
can ask her the same thing when we next see her.&quot;

&quot;Junon&#39;s Treasure Chest: Gifts and Things&quot; was a cramped and small 
store, sandwiched between a deli and a bakery. The front door was always 
open-even during times like these, as the shop had been opened after 
Shinra built in the security system. The sign, with its simple font, 
flickered during the night. Inside, cracked dry wall and a moist odorous 
scent of mold signaled red flags to those who entered. Only the 
dimwitted bothered with the store, and the locals knew better than to go 
near it-but there were always simpletons na&#139;ve enough to, at the very 
least, peep inside.

The narrow aisles and packed shelves had a devious purpose. An unmindful 
visitor often found their elbows the cause of shattered novelty 
figurines such as Cait Sith toys, &quot;Welcome to Junon&quot; snow globes, 
ceramic choking monkeys, and bootleg remakes of Dio&#39;s popular Fat Mog 
animated coin bank. Unforgiving and malicious, flabbergasted customers 
were charged ten gil per shattered piece-the more broken, the worse the 
bill.

This issue of business conduct was brought forth with the trade 
commission at Junon City Hall-unfortunately, with the leave of Shinra, 
new laws were passed giving more freedom to independent business 
owners...this included the right to decide compensation for broken 
merchandise, so long as a sign was posted stating the terms.

And there was a sign...

Posted at the far back of the store-

Behind the store clerk, whose surly gaze cut through the unhealthy swirl 
of pestilence and ill intent as fools stepped further into what could 
only be described as a diabolical trap of trade and commerce.

On the counter before her sat an untouched bowl of salad and a white 
plastic spork. Beneath the counter, taped to the underside, was a 
seven-inch, stainless steel hunting knife (75 off at Hank&#39;s Hollowed 
Hunting Hall!) An animated cat clock ticked dutifully on the adjacent 
wall. Under it was a pinned piece of paper that had a bar graph and a 
multitude of chaotic scribblings beneath it-notes and calculations. A 
slim door was present at the side of it which opened to a staircase that 
led to the second floor. This space, behind the counter, was simple and 
clear unlike the rest of the store. From there, she kept watch of this 
small domain.

Audrey Elizabeth Camaron was the queen of a pitiful and decrepit 
kingdom.

At that moment, her emerald eyes-typically given to distempered 
atrophy-brightened to something more as two women stepped through the 
open doorway. Morning light lit them from behind. At her counter, she 
sat up a little straighter on her stool and furrowed her fiery brows.

Her slim, able body was a soft bronze by the grace of the sun. Her red 
hair was a vibrant shade, but dull in shine and plagued by split ends. 
Her hands were wide, but not long, and strangely thin. There were scars 
across the palms in the form of &#39;X&#39; marks, and the knuckles were a deep 
ruddy shade with dry callouses where the bone was more profoundly seen 
through the skin. Beneath her bathrobe she wore jean short shorts like 
Yuffie&#39;s, and for a top she had on a baby blue tank top that said in 
bold print letters, &quot;SCREW BLUE.&quot; Her bare, dirty feet were hidden 
beneath the counter and fiddled with her slippers, which matched her 
robe perfectly (bought as a set-on sale at Filly&#39;s Fashions-one gil 
only!)

Audrey pulled her fuzzy purple star-printed bathrobe closer to her body 
as her gaze rested on the face of the one who first entered the store. 
Her lips became thin and her eyelids lowered to a more disdainful 
position. &quot;Flies. Flies have come into this poor little woman&#39;s honest 
business!&quot; She snarled.

Yuffie said nothing in response as she carefully entered the store, arms 
tucked in and her gait slow and careful. Lenna followed her lead. The 
ninja had warned her of how the store earned money prior to entering. 
The female soldier gazed past her companion at the red head at the back 
of the store. She scowled softly as she took in her appearance.

Yuffie crossed her arms as she stopped before Audrey&#39;s counter. She 
tried to appear as calm as possible, but her heart beat hard against her 
ribs and the feeling reverberated through her lungs-making steady 
breathing a discomfort. She hated being so nervous about a person, but 
the girl before her was not ordinary. Their history had not been 
ordinary. And true to form, the situation they were now in was not 
ordinary.

&quot;Hello, Audrey...&quot; Yuffie said as casually as possible. She brushed a 
stray strand of hair from her eyes and hooked her thumbs into the belt 
loops of her pants.

&quot;Hullo, oh backstabbing wench of the Western Seas.&quot; Audrey returned with 
a sarcastic salute. &quot;Did you happen to see my brother Otter at&#39;all? The 
barriers going up made me believe something wonderful happened, but 
alas...here you are before me.&quot; She pointed with a grin at the ninja&#39;s 
injured ear. &quot;I see he didn&#39;t entirely miss...&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s eyes became dangerous slits as she slammed her hand on the 
counter and leaned forward. &quot;You knew about it!?&quot; she shouted. &quot;You guys 
planned this the whole time??&quot;

&quot;Duh.&quot; Audrey said in a mocking, dopey voice. She crossed her eyes and 
stuck her finger in her ear and made as if she were sharpening a pencil. 
&quot;It was a simple matter of connecting point A to point B. You and your 
new flame were in a bind-you needed a place to run to-Junon would be one 
of the top choices.&quot;

&quot;But you couldn&#39;t have known I would come here.&quot;

&quot;No, but it was worth setting up for, just the same. Y&#39;know us 
pirates...sometimes we just need something a little more positive to 
focus our minds on to keep from sinking into the inky fog of mental 
malady.&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s body shook and she clenched her fists. Anger burned her veins 
and incited her muscles to take action. She imagined punching in 
Audrey&#39;s face, along with nuking all her family. Honestly...how could 
anyone plan something so uncertain? Was their spite and resentment so 
much that it went that far beyond monetary grudge? No...she had always 
known that Audrey&#39;s anger had been above that. The only way she had 
cared about money was in hoping she could begin schooling for a more 
honest trade-but Yuffie had destroyed that. In her anger and avarice she 
had cast someone innocent into a pit of perpetual greed.

This thought eased Yuffie&#39;s flare of moral rage into a remorseful state 
of feeling. She sighed heavily. &quot;Audrey, please...&quot; The girl begged, 
&quot;Please don&#39;t tell me you had any part in that. I don&#39;t care about 
me...okay well, I do...but I care about Tifa more. You didn&#39;t actually 
help in their plans, did you?&quot;

Audrey gave her a look and let an irritated noise escape the back of her 
throat. &quot;Idiot. Would I tell you that? Huh? And even if I said &#39;no&#39;, 
could you believe me?&quot; she snapped.

&quot;Maybe I&#39;m hoping your anger will make you honest. &#39;A heated tongue 
speaks without thought or consideration.&#39;&quot;

&quot;A Wutanese proverb? Oh my! Listen to the sweet lil&#39; princess, all 
bloody mature and sagacious. What sort of visage is that to don on, 
dear? Doesn&#39;t suit you. Where&#39;s the crass you used to throw about so 
much? What&#39;s this somber lump thats plopped itself before me?&quot;

&quot;I want to beg your forgiveness...&quot; Yuffie said, looking away. Lenna 
crossed her arms behind the girl and raised an eyebrow.

Audrey&#39;s face went slack. Then without warning she let out an 
incredulous laugh. &quot;By Ifrit&#39;s ear! Did I hear the word &#39;beg&#39; and 
&#39;forgive&#39; just come out of your mouth? In the same sentence? No really, 
did I??&quot; She let go of her bathrobe so that it fell open again and 
leaned her elbows onto the counter as she batted her long eyelashes with 
a dreamy expression. &quot;Oh pinch me, someone...&quot;

The teenage ninja grit her teeth and crossed her arms high on her chest. 
&quot;I&#39;m being honest! I&#39;ve felt terrible about what I&#39;ve done! I never took 
into account how it would affect you! If I&#39;d have known what would 
happen, I would&#39;ve done something different-!&quot;

&quot;And therein lies your mistake!&quot; Audrey barked, her humor suddenly gone. 
She picked up her plastic spork and scraped it across the counter 
surface so that it squeaked loudly against the polish. &quot;It wasn&#39;t just 
how you stabbed me in the back and left me here to take the blame for 
everything you did-it was the fact that you did that to us to begin 
with!! That money was for my family, you imbecile. It was for Otter to 
get braces, and for my cousins to get new clothes, and for my uncle to 
get his medicine for his heart, and...&quot; the girl trailed away. The spork 
stopped its noisy trail along the counter.

Yuffie felt her throat become tight. &quot;It was for you to go to school, 
huh...?&quot; she finished quietly. &quot;That...that was supposed to be the last 
bit of money to send you off to school...&quot;

Audrey glared at her. &quot;Well I guess things worked out fine...I got 
schooling in other things. That idealistic nonsense doesn&#39;t mean 
anything...You know what its like. We do what we must to get on, blah, 
blah, blah...&quot; The red head said the last bit with a roll of her eyes 
and her hand puppeting a person talking.

The ninja shook her head frantically. &quot;No!&quot; she half-shouted. &quot;No, it 
wasn&#39;t nonsense! You were going to help the Planet and the people and 
things on it! That isn&#39;t meaningless at all!!&quot;

&quot;No. Perhaps not. But you want to know what was really meaningless? Us 
ever being friends. The thought about all those years spent plagued by 
your presence turns my pretty skin a pale green.&quot; Audrey sneered. &quot;And 
you wanna know what else that was useless? Your ploy to &#39;save Wutai&#39;. 
What RUBBISH. Stealing materia and money and things...you were just 
another flamin&#39; hoodlum. But here, look&#39;it you. Miss Kisaragi got lucky, 
by the blessing of Leviathan no doubt, and landed in with a band of 
heroes to save the world with. You got cocky with them, but now you 
aren&#39;t so tough, are you? Not with your lady love caught in the sights 
of my brother&#39;s gun. Pity he missed getting his mark the first time...&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s face went blank. &quot;You don&#39;t mean that. Never in the years that 
I&#39;ve known you did you ever wish someone dead, Audrey.&quot;

&quot;Shows what you know. Did you know hate can do a lot to a person&#39;s soul? 
Problem is, I can&#39;t seem to find mine...&quot;

Yuffie placed a hand to her forehead. She breathed in deep and resisted 
the urges that rose in her. The urge to leave. The urge to yell. 
Terrible demons of thought and consciousness tore at her resolve. 
&quot;Audrey,&quot; she began in a low voice. She raised her head and held out her 
hand. &quot;I don&#39;t know how many more times I can say it. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll do 
whatever it is you want to make up for what I did...and I know this will 
seem crazy...butI&#39;ve got a favor to ask.&quot;

Audrey gave her a deadpan stare. &quot;...You&#39;re joking, right?&quot; she said 
dryly.

The teenager&#39;s face flushed a deep red as she said through tight lips, 
&quot;I need your help.&quot;

The red head didn&#39;t say anything for a whole minute. She sat rigid on 
her stool, her amber eyes wide as they bore a hole into Yuffie&#39;s face. 
Then she spat onto the counter crudely. &quot;You&#39;ve lost it, princess...&quot; 
Audrey said as she wiped her mouth with a rough wipe of her arm.

Yuffie&#39;s eyes took a sharp edge and she pointed an irate finger into 
Audrey&#39;s face. &quot;You irritating low-life!! I&#39;m trying to apologize to you 
from the deepest place of my heart, and I&#39;m asking you in the name of 
Alexander to help me out!&quot; The girl leaned forward so that she came a 
little over the counter and spread her arms wide. &quot;Isn&#39;t this what you 
want!? Me, vulnerable and in your debt?? C&#39;mon, Audrey, I can help you 
out as much as-!&quot;

Audrey jerked back from her, alarmed. &quot;Keep your sapphic gesticulations 
to yourself, you gormless twat!! I&#39;ve got a spork and I know how to use 
it. Hear me?&quot;

Yuffie stared at her as she fell back on her heels. &quot;What is your 
damage!?&quot; she exclaimed.

&quot;Well what&#39;s yours??&quot; Audrey returned nastily. &quot;Did you really expect 
this little crook to go skipping off ever so eagerly to aid you out of 
your predicament? Did a chocobo take a shit in your nutshell? What&#39;re 
you doing here, anyway? Do you want me to kill you? If that&#39;s the case, 
then I&#39;ll happily oblige!&quot;

Lenna quietly placed a hand on her gun, ready to draw it. Neither girl 
before her took notice.

Yuffie&#39;s face turned red. &quot;Look I&#39;m not trying to pick a fight with you, 
damn it! I&#39;m trying to make peace!&quot;

&quot;Peace?&quot; the young pirate scoffed at the word, her eyebrows rising with 
her incredulity. &quot;Peace she tells me! PEACE!!&quot; Audrey turned around on 
her stool and leaned backward onto the counter so that her warm locks 
draped the surface. Some strands slicked into the spit, and Yuffie 
covered her face in exasperation. The red head stretched her arms up to 
the ceiling as she shouted, &quot;Oh thanks be to the gods for this great and 
glorious event!! Yuffie Kisaragi has traversed the globe to make peace!&quot; 
Audrey twisted around like a rabid mongoose, her hair wild and her gaze 
equally bestial. &quot;And meanwhile all I want from her is her body in 
pieces!&quot;

&quot;FINE!&quot; Yuffie screamed. She pulled her shirt off in a quick and angry 
sweep, leaving only her bra, and Audrey almost fell off her chair in 
alarm.

&quot;Wha-what!?&quot; she sputtered as she averted her eyes and turned pink. When 
she regained herself she spoke in a high pitched voice, &quot;For Ifrit&#39;s 
sake, what do you think you&#39;re doing you ingratiating prat!? Have you 
lost your mind!?&quot;

Lenna raised an eyebrow at Yuffie. &quot;Do you really think you should-&quot;

Yuffie struck a fist over the center of her chest and shouted angrily at 
Audrey, &quot;Go on! Get that hunting knife! The one you still keep under 
that stupid counter! Take a piece! Take two! Take three! Take all of me! 
Just help us keep Otter from killing Tifa!! Please!!&quot; Yuffie knelt on 
the floor. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I betrayed you all those years ago! But I was just 
a kid, I didn&#39;t know what I was doing! It took a madman, an evil alien, 
and an apocalyptic meteor in the sky to get my head out of my ass, 
okay!? I was a colossal bitch! I&#39;ve still got problems dealing with 
people and I&#39;ve still got skeletons I&#39;ve gotta kick outta my closet, but 
I&#39;m asking you out of the deepest and most sincere way a human being 
could ever possibly manage-help me!&quot; Yuffie bowed and pressed her head 
to the floor in her native culture&#39;s show of respect.

Audrey leaned and stared down at her in blatant shock.

Lenna rubbed her chin. &quot;You&#39;re good at on-the-spot speeches, Yuffie.&quot; 
she said with clear admiration.

The red head seemed to suddenly take notice of the soldier, for she 
snapped her eyes on her and jeered. &quot;Who&#39;re you?&quot;

The special operative crossed her arms. &quot;I&#39;m her back up.&quot;

Audrey raised an eyebrow. &quot;I feel sorry for you.&quot;

Lenna shrugged but didn&#39;t say anything in response.

The female pirate returned her gaze to Yuffie, who still didn&#39;t rise. 
With grit teeth, she threw her salad bowl at the girl&#39;s back. &quot;Get up! 
Get up! I don&#39;t want lesbian residue on my lovely floors!&quot;

Yuffie straightened. There was a small circle of dirt on her forehead as 
she gazed resolutely into Audrey&#39;s eyes. &quot;I know you didn&#39;t help them 
make those terrible plans. I know you didn&#39;t. It&#39;s because you aren&#39;t 
given to that sort of thing. Maybe in a way, you&#39;re better than I am 
because of that. If it were me, I&#39;d be right next to Otter with a gun in 
hand.&quot; In truth, Yuffie was lying. She didn&#39;t know whether or not Audrey 
had helped them or not. Her hopes rested in smoking the other girl out 
in shock. She knew she was behaving in a startling manner-not many had 
ever seen Yuffie Kisaragi bow willingly to anyone, let alone say someone 
was better than she was. But it was by doing this that she hoped to see 
where Audrey really stood-and to see if this ploy was all just 
pointless.

Audrey picked up a stray lettuce piece and popped it into her mouth. 
&quot;Someone has to mind the store.&quot; She said quietly. She didn&#39;t look at 
Yuffie anymore, but stared off to the side.

Yuffie scooted closer to the counter and gazed up, her hopes lifting 
with the pirate&#39;s evasiveness. Audrey never looked away from a person&#39;s 
gaze unless the other person cornered her with a truth and she had no 
strong lies to stonewall them with. Even when conning others, though it 
was a bad habit, she couldn&#39;t help but do this.

&quot;You can leave the store anytime you want.&quot; Yuffie said quickly. &quot;I 
remember. You always closed the store to do other stuff-less important 
stuff. C&#39;mon Audrey, admit it-you&#39;re different from them. A little 
messed up in the head, sure, but who can blame you considering what 
you&#39;ve been through? Didn&#39;t I just say I&#39;ve got my own set of problems?&quot; 
The ninja stood to her feet and pointed at herself excitedly. &quot;I can 
help you. I can give you money for school...hell if there&#39;s even 
anything you&#39;d like me to do, then I&#39;ll do it! So will you help me? 
Please?&quot;

Audrey tongued her cheek. She looked at Yuffie out the corner of her 
eye. &quot;You&#39;ll do anything?&quot; she asked slowly.

Yuffie gave a grim nod, aware that the task may be unsavory.

The red head puckered her lips in thought and looked up at the ceiling. 
She shrugged and took up another stray bit of lettuce from the counter. 
&quot;Okay. I&#39;ll help you. But you give me a hundred thousand gil, AND do me 
a favor...&quot;

The teenager scratched her head. &quot;Two things?&quot;

Audrey raised an eyebrow. &quot;Forgiveness is one thing. A favor is another. 
I can&#39;t say you&#39;re a friend anymore, so no help is free.&quot;

Yuffie blinked, then nodded with a dejected expression. &quot;Okay...okay 
Audrey, that works. Sure.&quot;

&quot;One last thing.&quot; Audrey said with a raised finger.

The girl gazed at her, confused. &quot;Huh? What is it?&quot;

The pirate&#39;s lip curled. She took the lettuce she had and dipped it into 
the slosh of spit on the counter. She quickly flicked it at the ninja&#39;s 
chest, who dodged it with a startled yell. &quot;Put your flaming shirt back 
on you lecherous lesbo! If I&#39;m going to help you, you&#39;re going to behave 
just as I see fit-straight and narrow like an arrow!!&quot; Audrey shouted. 
She gestured at Lenna with a sneer. &quot;And what&#39;s with this one? Is she a 
rug muncher like you? Tell her to stop being so bloody creepy!&quot;

Yuffie gave Lenna a dry look after slipping on her shirt again. &quot;That, 
Audrey, is impossible...&quot; she deadpanned.

&quot;Baxter, this is hopeless. There&#39;s too many places to look and we 
haven&#39;t got the time.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve got to find a way. The longer we stay here, the more dangerous it 
is.&quot;

&quot;Sir, take a look at this, I bought a flashlight and a transistor radio 
from this peddler down the street-and there was a man out on his porch 
doing wood burning craft. The tool is a bit crude, but the wood burner 
will work all right for fusing wires. If you give me ten minutes I can 
whip up a decent scrambler to burn the security panels those guards use 
and we can get inside their private passages.&quot;

&quot;Great Henley. Do that. Looks like me and Tifa are going to have to 
secure disguises then.&quot;

&quot;Secure disguises? You don&#39;t mean...&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s go, I thought I saw a pair of policemen head down this alley 
here. Henley, find a quiet place to work. Me and Tifa should be able to 
handle this alone.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir.&quot;

Baxter went off without pause, and Tifa followed him uncertainly. Henley 
walked to the end of the street where he sat on a stoop and set to begin 
his work. With a nervous glance behind her, the woman cleared her 
throat. &quot;Is this really wise? And why would a pair of policemen come 
down this alley anyway?&quot; She walked carefully on the alley&#39;s uneven 
pavement. Puddles of cloudy water collected in the potholes, and the 
brick walls, separated only by a few feet, seemed to leer obscene 
messages at her in the form of fluorescent graffiti.

The soldier looked at her. &quot;Would you rather knock them out in full view 
of civilians?&quot;

The woman shook her head. &quot;Ah, no, I just mean-&quot;

&quot;It could be that they received a call about some of the thugs we ran 
into and they&#39;re taking a shorter route to the place of conflict.&quot;

&quot;If that&#39;s the case then maybe we shouldn&#39;t follow them. We don&#39;t want 
to see those men again, do we? If the police catch them, won&#39;t that 
bring them closer to ending the lock down?&quot;

&quot;Or maybe we should take the risk of nothing getting resolved-of their 
call being about something else, less important? I&#39;m not willing to sit 
here idly when there&#39;s something we can do. These tactics might seem 
extreme to you, but without the usual assistance we&#39;d get in other 
missions, we must utilize every opportunity made apparent to us...now 
please stay quiet, I think we&#39;re getting closer.&quot;

Tifa&#39;s lips went thin and she sighed inwardly. Baxter held up his fist 
as a signal for her to stop and she did so. They ducked behind a large 
green dumpster and, carefully, both peeped out to see the two police men 
conversing in hurried whispers to one another on the other side. Tifa 
frowned. What were they doing?

Shlack.

The sound of a bullet loading into a chamber made Tifa&#39;s heart go cold. 
Baxter&#39;s muscles tensed and he grit his teeth. Overhead, in a fire 
escape, the wheezing lackey named &#39;Rotgut&#39; pointed a gleaming 
semi-automatic pistol into Tifa&#39;s face. &quot;&#39;Lo there, pretty flower.&quot; He 
giggled quietly.

The dumpster rumbled. Another thug popped open the lid from inside and 
let out the breath he had been holding. &quot;Ifrit!&quot; He coughed. &quot;That 
flamin&#39; dumpster was going to be the death of me, mate!&quot; He waved his 
9mm pistol through the air as he chased the stench away.

Rotgut, with his squinted eyes and flat, pug face, glared at him. &quot;You 
moron, didn&#39;t I tell you the dumpster was no place to hide!?&quot;

As he said this the two policemen walked towards them, pistols out. They 
pointed them at Tifa and Baxter. &quot;Don&#39;t get your knickers in a twist, 
Rotgut.&quot; one of them said. Tifa stared up at them in disbelief. The man 
who spoke smiled at her. He had a fanged, rictus grin. Serpent&#39;s eyes 
flashed beneath the leather bill of a policeman&#39;s cap as Otter tilted 
his head to the side and chuckled deep in his throat. &quot;Miss me, love?&quot; 
he asked cheekily.

&quot;Put your hands up where I can see them!!&quot;

They all turned to see Henley, round face strained and covered in sweat 
as he pointed his gun at Otter. The man in question gave him a lazy 
grin. &quot;Son, put that away. You&#39;re wasting your time,&quot; he said.

Rotgut pointed his gun at the other soldier. &quot;You heard the man!&quot; he 
snapped.

Baxter&#39;s muscles coiled. With a swift upward grab, he seized the wrist 
of the thug in the dumpster and slammed his arm against the metal. The 
criminal&#39;s hand spasmed and lost grip of the gun. Otter lifted his 
firearm higher to shoot the blond, a needless motion as his gun had 
already been trained on the soldier to begin with. His devil-may-cry 
attitude had been rumpled by the surprise attack, and the pale-gazed 
operative capitalized on his brief inaction to reach forward and grab 
his gun arm. With a deft twist of his hand that forced him to release 
his weapon and a swift kick to the ringleader&#39;s exposed flank, Otter 
fell to the ground on his side. He rolled to his back and gasped as his 
stolen cap lay crumpled near his head, soaking in a puddle. Baxter 
returned his attention to his still captive enemy in the dumpster and 
took his head by the hair. With a grunt he slammed it on the container&#39;s 
edge. The nameless brute fell out of sight. The special operative 
managed all this within eight seconds.

The other thug in the police suit pointed his gun at Baxter with the 
start of the commotion. Taking advantage of his distraction, Tifa 
grabbed his gun arm and lifted it so that his side was left open. She 
punched him square in the ribs with all the force she could muster. 
Unpleasantly, she thought she felt something snap, but wasn&#39;t sure-and 
for good measure, she decided to flip the man to the ground and twist 
his pistol from his hand in the same fashion as Baxter did before her.

A shot rang out.

Henley gazed wide eyed as Rotgut, who had pointed his gun down at the 
two below him, turned to look at him again in surprise. His bullet 
barely grazed the criminal&#39;s hair. A rotted grin revealed itself as the 
wheezing man pointed his gun back at the soldier. &quot;Poor shot, boy...&quot; he 
laughed.

Baxter went to reach for his gun, but it was too late. Tifa turned to 
Henley and screamed in a shrill voice, &quot;Look out!&quot;

Another shot.

The sharp sound seemed unusually louder, as if fired by their ears. It 
echoed along the cold, damp bricks and roared in their chests and limbs 
as if the force of the noise itself was enough to wind them. Baxter&#39;s 
head snapped to Henley, and for a moment his cold, blank face took a 
look of great dread. &quot;Henley!&quot; he roared, his graveled voice peaking to 
the highest it could go.

Henley stared back at him, his lips pressed tight as he breathed hard 
through the nostrils. His arms hung at his sides, limp. He blinked sweat 
from his eyes as he looked at his superior and grinned weakly. &quot;Sorry, 
sir. I can&#39;t handle things too well unless its got a circuit board...&quot; 
when he spoke, his normally lyrical and energetic voice seemed deflated 
and weak.

Tifa gazed up at Rotgut and reached a hand up to her mouth. Blood 
dripped through the iron-weave of the fire-escape as the thug&#39;s lumpy 
face pressed against it with lifeless eyes turned downward. Next to her, 
Baxter held his firearm at the ready and looked around, muscles taut and 
brow furrowed. Dust fell from above. Slowly, all three companions looked 
up.

Draped in a crimson cloak that lifted with the caprice of the sea wind, 
their savior holstered his pistol. He stood atop the building opposite 
of Rotgut&#39;s, the tips of his metal plated boots barely peeking over the 
edge of the precipice. He stared down at Tifa through the locks of his 
dark mane and his eyes burned like Ifrit&#39;s flame. A golden claw revealed 
itself as it reached up to lower the leather collar that masked the 
lower part of his face. Tifa swallowed hard.

Vincent Valentine crouched down and tilted his head a fraction to the 
side.

&quot;&#39;O&#39; this was a wicked way, to which we had been led. Though happiness 
was what we sought-to the lions we were fed.&#39;&quot; the dark gunman recited 
this in a low voice-a voice affected by a ruthless despondency and a 
malicious underlying tone of bestial fury. He clenched his claw, the 
metal glinting in the morning light. For a moment, the fighter thought 
she saw her old teammate smirk.

&quot;It would seem true love is in need of help...isn&#39;t it, Tifa?&quot; he asked 
slowly.

A/N: The adventure aspect of this story would&#39;ve come in sooner or 
later, and while you guys may have seen this particular scenario a mile 
away, I&#39;d just like to say this...pooh-pooh! Ha, but really, this might 
be the hardest part of the story to write as there&#39;ll be more details to 
cover...and I haven&#39;t got this outlined at all. I&#39;ve got an idea of 
where I want it to go, but a lot of this is just spontaneous thinking. 
Here&#39;s the big question I was hoping to hear in the reviews, though:

What were your first impressions of Otter and Audrey?

The next chapters will have a lot more of them obviously, as well as our 
spooky pal Vincent. Fluff takes a vacation for a moment in favor of 
letting in some more action, angst, and a bit of quirky humor. Please 
don&#39;t kill me...I swear you guys will be drowning in the romance soon.

I don&#39;t claim to know anything about technology or hacking, and I figure 
I can fib my way through anything Henley does if it sounds technical 
enough...so if you actually know this stuff and are wondering what the 
hell I&#39;m talking about, its because I&#39;m a boob and too lazy to bother 
with the real thing. On that note, I&#39;m also saying now that I&#39;m fibbing 
my way through law enforcement procedure and general gun stuff. So, 
nyah.
