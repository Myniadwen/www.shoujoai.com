<h1>A Little Bar-Mad Shoujo-ai (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yurikitty.html">Yuri Kitty</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff7/barmaid-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>       When Chii came out of the bathroom, she walked back up to the 
bar. She was surprised to find that Tifa was there, waiting for her to 
return. Unfortunately for Chii, the waiting was not the one she had 
hoped for. When Tifa spoke, she confirmed what Chii feared. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, 
Chii.&quot; Tifa apologized. &quot;I think you&#39;re really beautiful and sexy, but I 
can&#39;t have sex with you. Cloud... he means too much to me. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; 
Chii tried to hide her disappointment. Besides the fact that she was 
looking for sex, she was very attracted to Tifa in a 
lovey-dovey-smoochy-romance BS way ((that really won&#39;t be described here 
and now because I don&#39;t want to talk about it. ^^)). Chii was successful 
in hiding her true emotions, although Tifa sensed them; she was just a 
very good friend and person to do that.
       Chii smiled. &quot;Well, I suppose I better go then.&quot;
       &quot;Have another beer?&quot; Tifa suggested. Chii shook her head.
       &quot;No thanks.&quot;
       &quot;Why not?&quot;
       Chii smiled and shrugged. &quot;Out of gil.&quot; ((they... have gil in 
FF7... right?)).
       &quot;On the house.&quot; Tifa offered, before she even realized what she 
had said. Chii smiled at her, making Tifa&#39;s heart thump, and she agreed. 
She got a beer but this time, to her disappointment, Chii did not sit at 
the bar. She moved to a table all by herself near the far side of the 
bar. Tifa felt guilty; like she had considerably hurt Chii&#39;s feelings. 
The reason that she had volunteered Chii another beer, was not because 
she wanted to be good at her job; it was because, against what she 
wanted herself to believe, she wanted Chii to stay.

       About tewnty minutes later...
       Tifa was still working. It was an hour until the end of her 
shift. Once in a while she glanced over at Chii, but Chii never returned 
her gaze. She was sitting all alone at her table, almost finished with 
her beer. When Tifa realized this, she panicked a little. She still 
wanted Chii to stay; she wanted her nearby. Each time she looked at 
Chii, it was getting harder and harder to deny that she felt nothing for 
her. The more she thought it over and looked at her, the more she felt 
herself being pulled towards her. She did want Chii.
       Once Chii stood up after finishing her beer, Tifa hurried away 
from behind the bar, leaving it to the other bartender like she had 
earlier. She knew, no matter what, she had to keep Chii near her. She 
wanted Chii. She wanted Chii badly.
       But Tifa was cut off. Before Chii had had enough time to even 
move two feet away from her table, three scruffy men ganged up around 
her and hid Tifa from view. &quot;Hello there, sweet little thing.&quot; One of 
them said. He was the middle one, and Chii guessed that meant he was the 
&#39;ring-leader&#39; of their little group. Being so, he was also clearly the 
one who was the most shit-faced of the three. &quot;How would you like to 
come with us for a little ride?&quot;
       Chii looked at them, disgusted. &quot;How would you like your balls 
cut off, you big baboons?&quot;
       The two henchmen laughed scoffingly, as if Chii was kidding ((she 
wasn&#39;t)). The middle one smirked a wide smile, causing the pollution of 
his liquor-smelling breath to wash over Chii. She coughed and waved her 
hand like a fan in front of her nose, trying to get the smell away from 
her. &quot;I think you misunderstood me. Didn&#39;t she, boys?&quot; As if on cue, 
like they were remote-controlled, the two lowly henchmen nodded their 
heads and laughed.
       &quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; They chorused.
       &quot;Cuz, the way I understand it, what I just asked you was not a 
choice question. You&#39;re going to come with us. Got it now?&quot;
       Standing back defensively, Chii held up her arms, fists clenched, 
ready to fight. &quot;I understand alright. I&#39;ll make your full dick 
circumcisions quick, but with as much pain as possible. That is, the 
more you try to touch me, the slower and more painful your 
dick-amputations will be. You got that?&quot;
       The two henchmen seemed to get Chii&#39;s drift and they slowly 
backed off. Out of fear or even respect for their leader, did they stay 
and not completely retreat like little pussies.  But it was clear that 
they knew Chii&#39;s threat was for real, and they were not willing to stay 
around and have their &#39;manly-hood&#39; taken from them. The leader, however, 
still did not head. He was either too drunk or too stupid to realize the 
seriousness that Chii showed. Either way, he advanced slowly on her, his 
hand holding a concealed knife. The knife&#39;s blade caught the light of 
the bar and flashed. Tifa saw it. At the last second, she screamed, 
&quot;CHII! LOOK OUT!&quot; Chii headed her warning with little room to spare. She 
jumped out of the way and did a gymnastic-Matrix move in the air before 
landing on the table of another party. Scared by the violence, they 
hurried out and away from the bar. Others gathered around ((but at a 
safe distance)) chanting, &quot;FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!&quot;
       The burly and drunk man then turned his attention towards Tifa. 
She had been the one to warn Chii and thus deprived him of his kill. 
Chii&#39;s mouth dropped open. &quot;Tifa! Look out!&quot; She screamed. The man dived 
at her with the knife, but she easily dodged. She stepped on his head as 
she flew above him, towards Chii. The man fell in a drunken stupor. Tifa 
landed on the table beside Chii. She smiled at her.
       &quot;Ready to kick some ass?&quot; Tifa asked.
       &quot;Hell, yeah!&quot; Chii smiled and they then proceeded to kick the 
shit out of the three drunken men. They quite enjoyed themselves, too. 
At least, they WERE enjoying themselves before the rest of their gang 
awoke. Despite their aching heads, they were able to make out what Tifa 
and Chii had done. Growling, the men ((I&#39;m picturing them to be like 
minatours... not really sure why... ^^)) then got up and began to 
charge. Tifa, noticing this, dropped her mouth open in fear and 
astonishment while Chii was still kicking the bodies of the fallen and 
passed-out/beat up perverts.
       &quot;Chii...&quot; Tifa said a little slowly.
       &quot;What?&quot; Chii asked, still enjoying kicking the men.
       &quot;RUN!&quot; Chii looked up upon hearing the horror in Tifa&#39;s sexy 
voice and she saw the men running towards them. They both instantly 
jumped over the fallen bodies and ran out the back door of the bar, down 
the long street ahead of them. When they had run far enough away that 
they were sure they would not be caught, then they stopped and rested 
for breath. Tifa leaned up against the side of a building and Chii 
collapsed a little over-dramatically on the ground. Both breathed in and 
out heavily, trying to catch their breath. When they did more or less,  
Tifa sat down on the ground beside the sprawled Chii. &quot;I think we&#39;re 
safe now.&quot;
       &quot;Me too.&quot; Chii agreed. After a moment&#39;s silence, she then said, 
&quot;What about your job? Weren&#39;t you still working?&quot;
       Tifa laughed a little. &quot;Yeah. I&#39;ll probably get fired. This 
happens to me a lot.&quot;
       &quot;Running off?&quot;
       Tifa smiled. &quot;More like getting into fights then running away 
from it before I get pummeled. This is the second time this week.&quot;
       &quot;So, you will get fired?&quot;
       &quot;Probably.&quot; Tifa replied, sighing heavily. &quot;But the manager... 
he&#39;ll hire me back. He always does. With this body, I bring in a LOT of 
customers.&quot;
       &quot;I don&#39;t doubt it.&quot; Chii said, sitting up. Tifa blushed. She 
would have laughed if she knew that Chii was joking, but the seriousness 
in her voice made her believe she was telling the truth. It made Tifa&#39;s 
heart thump in her chest. &quot;Why did you help me anyway, Tifa?&quot; Tifa was 
at a loss for words. She did not know what to say. Before she could 
respond, Chii sighed lightly. &quot;I know why.&quot;
       &quot;You do?&quot; Tifa was surprised.
       &quot;It&#39;s because you wanted me to fuck you up so badly that you 
could not possibly let me die. You knew you wanted a piece of me. So you 
helped.&quot; Tifa stared at her, speechless. She had not thought Chii to 
have that big of an ego... But then Chii&#39;s laughter echoed and rang 
through the air. Tifa felt a little embarrassed. Chii had been joking. 
Chii saw the embarrassment on her face, even though Tifa smiled. 
&quot;Sorry.&quot; She said. &quot;I couldn&#39;t resist.&quot;
       &quot;Well... you were a little right.&quot; Tifa admitted quietly. This 
caused silence between them; a dead, empty silence. A very deafening 
silence. Tifa looked down at her knees and she felt her face burn once 
again. /How could you say that?!// She screamed at herself mentally. 
Tifa was shocked when she felt warm breath on her neck and then was met 
by soft, moist lips. She froze. Looking up, she met Chii&#39;s face only 
several inches away from her own. From her light silhouette, Tifa could 
make out the outline of Chii and she could see Chii&#39;s big beautiful eyes 
and round lips; perfect for just kissing for hours on end. Tifa felt her 
cheeks flush again and she could hear her heart pounding. There was 
still silence between them as they stared intensely at each other. 
Finally, Chii said quietly,
       &quot;Do you want to do this, Tifa?&quot; Tifa nodded her head. &quot;Are you 
sure?&quot; Once again she nodded her head; but this time a little more 
earnestly. &quot;Then prove it. Kiss me.&quot; Tifa did, without any hestiation. 
Leaning close, her lips locked with Chii&#39;s. Chii was a bit surprised at 
the passion that was evident in her kiss. But she did not reject it.
       When their lips slowly drew apart, Tifa slowly opened her eyes 
and looked at Chii. Chii smiled. &quot;Not bad. Let&#39;s go.&quot; Happily, Tifa 
stood up and went to her place where she and Chii could be alone.
