------------------------------------

This world is a crazy place.

It holds on to you, even when everything is over.

What is it that makes such things endure?

But purest of all things, sweetest of all agonies, is the love within 
life itself. Is the knowledge that life is fleeting, that at any given 
moment, life might be taken away from you. So you cling hard to it, you 
cling as hard as you can to this life. And when you cling and leave 
those marks, impressions of yourself, you never fade.

In the hearts of loved ones, in the memories they continue to hold dear 
to them, locked up secret wishes that no one can ever know... why can&#39;t 
they know? I think... you shouldn&#39;t keep those things to yourself. 
Mostly because you might never know when life is over and you&#146;ve missed 
all your chances. Happiness? That is fleeting too. So like life, grab it 
by the hand and tug it closer, closer and even then, closer still. That 
the heart of fire that is happiness, that is life, burns you.

You will see things. You will do things. Each one stranger and yet more 
wonderful than the last, a world of unfolding possibilities...

...so live it. Live it all. Be it all. Be everything that you can be!

And I will know, because I am watching over you. One day, you&#39;ll see it. 
You&#39;ll understand.

I know you will.

Ah, but isn&#39;t this world such a crazy, crazy place?

------------------------------------

She was a broken puppet with her strings cut. A face marked with slight 
liquid hints of viridian hue were the grave testimony to the last smile 
she held on her lips where bloody froth had bubbled and cauterised the 
skin red in remembrance. The redness mocked the flush of life that would 
have suffused her, if she were only sleeping and with those eyes closed 
so peacefully, long lashes touching her cheeks gently, an onlooker would 
have been forgiven for making that mistake. Her hair was unravelling 
from the high braided ponytail she wore each day, the pink ribbon had 
slipped to the floor and highlighted itself against the bloody drag 
marks left from moving her to the side of the altar. Her pink dress was 
ruined by the red stain, darkened to brown, but her hands were clasped 
over her middle.

She stood to the side, trying hard to maintain some composure, a shred 
of dignity.

But whatever face she gave the outside world, inside, she was bleeding 
and dying. Surely as her beloved angel had fallen with that smile, that 
lovely, lovely smile for her alone, she too was losing every shred of 
faith left in this world. The light shattering down from the heights 
onto a city chipped from crystal was cold and no comfort; the lurid glow 
of the mako suffused water not helping either.

So she wrung her hands together and focused on that pain, because that 
pain was real, that pain was here and now.

The faces of the others wore masks of grief, from the openly weeping 
Yuffie who was hugging Red and soaking his fiery fur with her helpless, 
heart broken tears - Red wasn&#39;t displeased, as he howled mournfully, 
notes without aim, pressing his shoulder into that of the Ninja girls to 
try and award her some comfort. Vincent, Cait and Cid were lined to the 
other side, their faces devoid of anything else except such bitter 
sadness. To her right was Barrett, the rock of muscle, the brief 
declaration of sanity she could cling to in this storm of dying.

&quot;Aerith...&quot; Cloud whispered. He was stood before her, staring down at 
her peaceful form with tears openly burning his cheeks in tracks of salt 
water, spotting his front and curdling in the blood pool that lay still 
by his steel capped toe. His voice was broken and she knew, despite all 
her jealousy, Cloud had loved her too. Cloud had lost too.

So she couldn&#39;t even summon the tiniest shred of apathetic anger, 
watching him kneel close by her and brush a wayward lock of golden brown 
hair from her beautiful face. Instead she turned away, cupping a hand to 
her mouth and trying hard not to weep, narrowing her eyes on the prickle 
behind her eyelids.

What did she do now?

&quot;Tifa,&quot; grunted the ebon skinned terrorist, but she didn&#39;t look at him, 
focusing away from the scene of the carnage, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Tifa. If 
we&#39;d only known, if she&#39;d only said something.&quot;

&quot;She never would have,&quot; she replied in a frozen voice from numb lips, 
marvelling at how steady her voice sounded. &quot;You know how Aerith was. 
She wanted us to be safe... even if it cost her... our future.&quot;

&quot;But it doesn&#39;t take away your pain though, does it?&quot;

&quot;No, it doesn&#39;t.&quot; Tifa closed her eyes, &quot;So don&#39;t shower me with 
clich&eacute;s, or platitudes. Don&#39;t offer me cold comfort, I don&#39;t need it.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;I...want her back,&quot; she choked on the whisper, the tears finding a 
treacherous way down her cheeks to spill over her fingers and the metal 
edge of her formidable gauntlets. &quot;I want to be back there... when she 
sat on the slide, next to Cloud and I was riding away on the cart with 
the chocobo, to see Don Corneo. I want to be there, so I can say to her; 
&#39;You can&#39;t come with us, because you&#39;ll have to die.&#39; And face never 
falling in love...&quot;

Barrett&#39;s hand was a heavy, comforting weight on her shoulder, &quot;Could 
you have lived without loving her?&quot;

&quot;I-if it meant she was alive... yes, oh gods and hells, yes...&quot;

&quot;Then you would be willing to give up a lot in turn for her.&quot; He smiled 
and she glanced up at his face, kind despite how fearsome it could be 
when he was angry. &quot;Isn&#39;t that what she did, for you?&quot;

She hadn&#39;t noticed what Cloud was doing, so when she flicked her eyes 
across, she was surprised to see that he was carrying her cradled to his 
chest; the flower girls head lolled without muscle tone to keep it 
upright and her nose rested on his shoulder. With each step her hair 
tugged a little more loosely from the binding ribbon. After a moment of 
watching Tifa realised that he was carrying her out of this place and 
bent to take the pink ribbon as it fell to the floor.

I&#39;ll wear this, so I can always keep something of you with me, beyond my 
memories of you.

One by one, they slowly came away from loitering by the pool of sticky 
blood and up towards the moonlit area just beyond the shell house where 
they had descended the stairs to the altar, where Aerith had faced the 
worst few moments of her life. The area was small with a pool of radiant 
green water by a dip in the bank to lead into that lake which seemed to 
radiate an air of sanctity about it. It was there that Cloud paused.

Tifa tucked the ribbon in next to the small velvet black box and then 
tilted her head.

After a moment of deciding, Cloud stuck his foot into the water and 
began to step forward. It was upon this motion that alarm bells went off 
into her head; was he planning on making her grave this watery den, 
where no light would reach her beautiful face? Hadn&#39;t Aerith said her 
dreams were filled with water? That she was falling, drowning...

Horror crept into her cold heart and she clapped hands over her mouth as 
she opened it to emit a silent scream.

Almost months ago, you told me you dreamed of the water. You dreamed of 
falling into it... you knew... You really knew on some distant level of 
your soul that if you came here, there was a high possibility you&#39;d die. 
&#39;Not Long Now&#39;. That&#39;s what you said. That&#39;s what you were trying to 
tell me, only I couldn&#39;t hear you. Aerith... don&#39;t go!

And she was moving too then, her feet splashing in the water as she 
flung out a hand and grasped Cloud&#39;s arm roughly, dragging him back. 
They both stood to their knees in the water, it was cold and clear, but 
she ignored the chill creeping up her legs. She stared into his grief 
stricken blue eyes.

&quot;Don&#39;t do it, please don&#39;t do it - not here.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; she pleaded, trying to make him understand, &quot;She dreamed of 
it, she told me but I didn&#39;t know - she knew, Cloud, she knew all along 
but was too frightened to admit this would happen. Don&#39;t let her go down 
there! Don&#39;t do it!&quot;

&quot;...Tifa... she has to rest now. We&#39;ll do the rest for her.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; she breathed, &quot;Don&#39;t you dare...&quot;

&quot;...&quot; with sad eyes he turned and carried on. She tried to hang on but 
her grip slipped from his arm.

Taking several wading steps after him, anger and fear warring in her 
throat, Cid was suddenly there; a compassionate arm dragging her from 
the water, to the aid of Vincent&#39;s strength as they both fought to keep 
the fighter from diving headlong at Cloud. She struggled hard against 
them, pulled back from the watery edge and with this, she flailed like a 
madwoman. She kicked out, screaming, &quot;NO!&quot; so hard that her vocal chords 
felt as though they were ripping.

And with each step he took, she died a little more inside.

He lowered her.

...tick...

The water pooled around her face, the smile still there, golden brown 
hair making a murky halo in the clear water.

... ...tick... ...

His hand pressed to his middle to stem the convulsions of his own 
sobbing. She was weeping, held up only by the two men as she collapsed, 
watching her angel sink, or perhaps, fly away.

...ti...

----------------------------------------

They battled across the wintry mountains and she felt her own despair 
keener than any knife. She took pains to hide it, trying to remain 
cheerful, trying to fill the void Aerith had left in the &#39;bubbly&#39; side 
of their misfit group of travellers but never more aware of her own deep 
loss, rooted in her heart. That they slogged through snow and adverse 
conditions meant little to her, only that soon they came to a small and 
sleepy little town in the heart of the snow capped peaks and there, 
rested a while.

Curios and feeling intent about something, she went looking around the 
town, watching the children throwing snowballs and trying hard not to 
picture the future of her and Aerith together. Perhaps they would have 
adopted a child? That would have been good. Aerith would have made such 
a wonderful mother, making their children aware that the Planet needed 
to be cared for, taking care of nurturing life whilst she ran the 
business and kept the love of her life happy and whole.

Frozen tears were drying on her cheeks when she stumbled across the 
small house, holed away to the back of the town and inside there, she 
sat on a bed that had gathered enough dust for ten centuries to feel 
proud of. When the sobbing fit had passed, grateful that no one had seen 
her, she stopped to actually look around the strange room with all the 
gadgets and components, the telescope pointed to the far northern pole, 
the beds and the desk, littered with almost crumbling sheets of paper 
and somewhat worrying bloody patches on the floor close to a device 
which looked similar to that a video machine.

She came over curiously and peered all around it, then about the house 
into which she called out in a voice still damaged from her wild 
screaming fit; &quot;Hello?&quot;

There was not a single answer, only the quiet dust continuing to pile up 
with unthreatened patience. Tifa shrugged and turned back to the 
machine, peering at the small slot and the many buttons which dotted the 
smooth, metal surface of it.

I&#39;m no good with machines, if Jessie were here, this wouldn&#39;t be a 
problem. Ah, I just know I&#39;m going to mess this up!

Wincing, and sniffling from both cold and subsiding tears, Tifa prodded 
at several buttons, peering up at the monitor after twelve or so passes 
when it flared into life with a slightly fuzzy recording. She could make 
out a woman and a man, talking together. As she watched, she listened to 
the woman talk about things that she had heard in many different 
incarnations before, about Jenova and her crash down landing onto the 
world, causing a terrible wound that had brought many Cetra together to 
try and repair it, and the subsequence virus that infected the race as a 
backlash.

The video cut off.

Disgruntled, she pressed a few more buttons and was pleased to be 
rewarded with another video. Chewing on a lock of hair as she watched 
intently, the woman spoke about things called Weapon and the danger of 
the Planet. If the Planet sensed great danger that would affect it, then 
these all powerful beings would be called upon to eradicate the threat 
from the face of the world. But it would judge what is good and what is 
bad. Then the woman mentioned that she was pregnant with the scientist&#39;s 
child.

There the video cut off again.

&quot;What a strange piece of knowledge... an Ancient,&quot; Tifa breathed, and 
then as she was just about to go, something else caught the corner of 
her eye and she stopped.

A pile of discs littered the spot close by the monitor, but the one 
which had stood out was a pale green jewel case with the lettering on it 
which read: &quot;Our daughter.&quot;

&quot;They had a daughter?&quot; Tifa smiled, reaching for the disc and pausing 
only briefly to wrestle with her guilt. Sure, it wouldn&#39;t be good 
manners to watch someone else&#146;s private moments, but she&#39;d watched this 
far hadn&#39;t she? Besides, curiosity wasn&#39;t a bad thing and she was 
starting to warm to the strange couple who spoke of vast and great 
things that were beyond her simple life.

She pushed the disc onto the tray which popped out and once more, fought 
over the buttons with eager fingers to cajole life from the machine, 
sniffing a little. Then the screen came up and she glanced up with dark 
eyes, stepping back to take in the scene.

&quot;Filming, again?&quot; The woman said. In her arms she cradled a bundle that 
squirmed about a little, a small arm reaching out to which she chuckled. 
The camera angled and zoomed into the back of her head as the scientist, 
a man in his thirties with neat brown hair and sparkling eyes but the 
loveliest smile joined them.

&quot;You know I can&#39;t resist filming.&quot;

&quot;Maybe then she&#39;ll be a film star.&quot;

They laughed together, so naturally that Tifa smiled too. Then the 
camera moved and she could see the baby, a beautiful baby. All babies 
are without saying, cute to some degree as a natural defence mechanism 
against the cruel world, but this baby was truly beautiful. She found 
herself going &#39;awww&#39; without realising it. Then the man adjusted his 
glasses.

&quot;Aerith the film star, you think so? Why, with her half Cetra heritage, 
she can be anything.&quot;

Tifa stopped breathing.

&quot;Then I just want her to be happy and healthy, isn&#39;t that enough?&quot;

The couple looked up and waved to the camera, cajoling the babe into 
waving. Already tucked about her was a pink swaddling, and in the hair 
of the mother was tied a bow of ribbon which a similar one now lay in 
her pouch. But the mother&#39;s face - it lacked the beautiful smile of the 
flower girl, she must have inherited that from her father - but the 
eyes... Ancient eyes, glowing with green life. Her looks were those of 
her mysterious origins, Cetra origins and there was no mistaking it. In 
some far flung town, sleep and forgotten by all but snow, she had found 
one of the few precious things that Aerith had always wanted to know.

&quot;Oh Rissy,&quot; she gulped, pressing a hand to her chest as her vision 
blurred, &quot;You were so loved.&quot;

------------------------------------

Days pass. Experiences grow.

We, as humans or as Cetra, we evolve. We become better, stronger, faster 
and sometimes sadly, harder. But these shallow breaths between the world 
and ourselves, between knowing and doing.

Closing your ears to the static sound of life, blocking out the pain 
with smiles or with tears, pretending like life is charade that you can 
continue to mime in; you play a part in the vast theatre of life. But 
when it&#39;s time to consider your actions, what will you do then? You 
faced terror and left, silent, on the wings of despair as seemingly yet 
another person is taken from you.

But I am here with you, so don&#39;t be afraid.

-------------------------------------

The blond witch tightened the straps that restrained her to the point of 
pain and she gritted her teeth against the taste of blood that curdled 
in her mouth from the slap handed out for her &#39;insolent&#39; stare. She 
could only recall the meeting in the ShinRa building, long ago it felt 
like, when they had been looking for Aerith, and this rich bitch had 
chortled into a hand and fawned all over the president.

After all of that, they were pinned with blame once the Weapons had 
awakened in their crater in the frozen north, long after they had 
followed Sephiroth up great chasms of ice and down the slopes towards 
the Great Injury of the Planet which was still trying to heal itself. 
Even when they had helped them to escape, she was being strapped in here 
as the first victim of their faceless propaganda effort, left to die.

The door clanged shut and she heard the bolts locking.

Gas was a horrific way to go, slowly drifting off with nothing but the 
sound of your own choking to usher you into the life stream. Tifa bent 
her head and shook it, eyes closing with small marked lines of pain 
around her eyes. Was this it?

Was this everything that she had finally struggled for?

Death was her answer, it seemed. Death waited for her.

And where death was, there would be Aerith.

She smiled a sad little curve of her mouth, poisoned with the cold touch 
of failure. She was a failure after all of this.

Sat on the slide with your pink dress hiked up to show your legs, 
staring at me with wide green eyes, over the shoulder of a man I once 
thought I loved, but now only pity and worry for. Capturing my heart so 
easily and leading me after you, after the gentle voice. Was this your 
destiny?

Did I get in the... way?

All those times; sweet times when I held your hand in either your 
innocence of my affections for you, or with the darkest knowledge of 
that deadliest attraction. Fun times, with hot chocolate or with the 
camera or that day where you pushed me into that lake? It was cold, but 
I laughed. Sad times; holding you when you wept from bad dreams, or told 
me all about Zack, your first boyfriend who by some strange twist of 
fate, was the same Zack who had been there on the very night my life had 
changed.

I was in the way, wasn&#39;t I?

You and Cloud... I was just a sideline attraction. I was just a joke. 
Did you know the punch line for me?

So here it ends, and it&#39;s okay... because I loved you. You were my 
&#145;somebody&#146;... and, I&#39;m grateful... for all the time...

Tears slid down her cheek and she bit on her lower lip, fighting the 
sob, knowing that Scarlet would die to hear her sobbing. No crying, 
there would be none of that. Like her beloved flower girl, she would 
face the end with her head held high. So she drew her head up and looked 
up even as the gas filled the chamber. The natural instinct to survive 
kicked in and so Tifa held her breath even as she heard pounding from 
the other side of the door - Barrett&#39;s voice and then footsteps, 
abandoning her.

After a few minutes where she coughed on the rancid air between helpless 
little intakes of breath, she lifted her eyes as something betrayed her 
eyesight - a flash of red.

Giving up so soon? Not very heroine-like, is it?

&quot;...A-Aerith...?&quot;

An almighty detonation filled the air and she was showered with bits of 
metal. Sound escaped into the small room and she hurriedly struggled 
free of her constraints and cupped hands over her mouth, peering up 
through the smoke that was suddenly boiling into the little room. 
Peeping just behind it was a massive rent in the metal with edges that 
were cooling from what looked to be some kind of high powered laser 
attack. She stared at it for a moment, and then as her lungs protested 
with a heaving cough, she narrowed her eyes and started up and out of 
the room.

Behind her the door clanged open and she glanced back as she hauled 
herself over the narrow jutting cut in the metal to see two soldiers in 
ShinRa uniform and Scarlet, sneering up at her in total disgust.

Unable to help herself and feeling inexplicably giddy (but that could 
likely be put down to the gas she had inhaled without meaning to) she 
pulled on the skin under her left eye and stuck her tongue out, then let 
go of the cut&#39;s edges, to shimmy down the side of the building. She came 
to a rest by the butt of the giant Junon cannon.

Run then... a voice urged her and she smiled.

With quickening steps, she broke into a run to the end of the cannon and 
then, stopped once she reached the wavering end. There was only the 
massive, roiling sea below her and behind her, she looked to see Scarlet 
was the only one to have caught up with her, surprising spry and agile 
in those tottering red heels and tight dress - but up close the 
unlovely, aging face was marred by an inexplicable hatred for her.

Tifa drew herself up and raised one single brow.

&quot;Stuck up...&quot; muttered the old hag, moving to slap Tifa&#39;s cheek. She 
almost didn&#39;t move quickly enough, half of the hand smacking on her skin 
to leave a red mark. As the Weapon&#39;s Development head drew her hand back 
with a smirk, Tifa lifted her own hand in turn. &quot;Slapping match?&quot; She 
sneered.

Tifa doubled her fist and punched her on the bridge of her nose.

In shock, Scarlet reeled back, clutching her broken nose and wailing in 
a loud voice. Tifa smirked and then cautiously wiped her hand down on 
the shiny barmaid skirt she wore, before retrieving the small pouch she 
normally wore from Scarlet&#146;s waist. A quick press of her fingers assured 
her that the velvet box was still inside and then she glared down at the 
hag.

&quot;That&#39;ll teach you,&quot; she muttered, feeling nonsensical for saying it.

A rope flapped from nowhere suddenly with a great wind drifting up with 
it, fluttering her hair. She shaded her eyes, peering up towards the sky 
ship which hovered high above and the figures of Yuffie, Cait and 
Barrett waving down to her, urging her to grab the rope. So she took a 
running dive for it.

Her hands missed and slipped, so she winced, and as she was waiting to 
hit the waves she could have sworn that a pair of cool, soft hands 
reached over her own and pulled them into holding the rope. She grabbed 
on, blinking a few times as the world pulled away, but the fresh breeze 
sifted about her, and Tifa smiled.

----------------------------------

Even when all seems lost, there is hope to go on.

Even when all seems dark, there will be something to light your way.

Even when love turns to hate, the memory of love will linger on.

So in that darkness, I cannot help you at all, so you must do it.

His dark heart, the shadows inside of him - I cannot push them aside 
from where I was, but here, I can show you this much. Once upon a time, 
in a world not so far away, there was a little boy... that little boy 
wanted to prove himself to the people he cared for and those that didn&#39;t 
care for him much at all. Because they all expected so much of him, he 
grew up feeling insecure and often like he was never going to be good 
enough for anyone. With this in mind, he left his village...

...one day, five years later, he comes home to his village. His best 
friend, a Soldier with a big sword on his back, tells him that it&#39;s 
alright to just be himself, to be shy and a little worried about how 
life can often give you lemons. But as he struggles with the idea of 
telling the girl from her icy throne what he wants to try and tell her, 
his superior goes mad. It&#39;s unexpected and a lot of people die.

Afterwards, an evil doctor puts both him and his best friend into an 
experiment, hidden deep underneath the Mansion house. The best friend 
remains conscious most of the time, thanks to previous experiments upon 
him. So he escapes, taking the little boy with him. On the edge of the 
broken city, he dies saving his friend. The little boys mind is a mess 
of drugs and deficiencies, so he takes up the sword and part of his best 
friend&#39;s persona.

...and becomes the Cloud Strife I met.

But now, you know the truth, don&#39;t you? So don&#39;t be afraid.

I&#39;ll guide you both from the Life Stream... because you don&#39;t belong 
here.

Take care of him, because he can&#39;t take care of himself just yet... and 
stay smiling...

-----------------------------------

--One month later--

She held onto his side, fearing for the worst as he breathed shallowly 
on the rock ledge, on his hands and knees. Sweat dripped down his knife 
keen profile and she studied the swathe of pale blond hair. His eyes 
were unfocused and if she didn&#39;t know better, she would say that he was 
weeping, that he was crying his heart out.

She was a violent mess of bruises, cuts and blood - her hair a wild and 
dusty tangle, her skin bloodlessly pale from exertion. Her limbs 
wouldn&#39;t cease shaking from the loss of energy after such a long fight 
and deep down, she knew the sound of Holy escaping was louder, stronger 
and soon it would flood past and push away everything in its way.

&quot;Cloud,&quot; she said, &quot;We have to go. Come on.&quot;

He nodded without looking up at her, getting numbly to his feet and 
swaying towards the ship which Cid was already fixing, bellowing orders 
to the rest of them as if they were his &#39;numbskull&#39; crew. She glanced 
longingly back at the water and the shine coming from it, echoing up the 
cavern of the pole when she heard her name being called. So turning away 
from this strange and sacred place still littered with powerful Cetra 
magic, she hurried onto the Highwind and waited nervously.

She stood by the front panels that exposed the world, windows so thick 
that very little could shatter them. Beside her was Cloud and Red, 
Yuffie clinging to a panel close by Cait and both Cid and Barrett 
hanging onto the wheel for grim death. Only Vincent stood still as if 
the motions of the plane were a troublesome, yet ignorable thing to him. 
She clung to the railing around the front, noting that Red simply put 
his back to a raised panel so he would have no need to cling to 
anything.

With a jolt of power, the ship was flung from the vibrant core of life 
into the very sky and she winced; suddenly everything was white and she 
was sure her arms were going to pull right out of her sockets. Then, 
with a curse from behind her as the ship started flashing red lights and 
honking noises, she heard the tug of mechanical parts and the booster 
engines flared into life.

Slowly the ship righted its self and she opened her eyes, on her knees 
by the windows.

In the great beyond outside, the flood of white and pale green surged 
towards the town of Midgar, where Meteor had chosen to finally fall. She 
followed it with awe stricken eyes, the flowing motion of the watery 
like substance capturing her imagination and her broken heart, still 
broken, always broken forever more.

Without having a need to ask, Cid started to pilot the ship after the 
flood of light and she wiped an unsteady hand on her chin, the thin 
dribble of blood from where she&#39;d bashed against the railing. Cloud 
stood upright beside her.

The ship was fast - and with Cid&#146;s skills it took them perhaps half an 
hour to follow the pathway of light to the city.

There Holy was circling underneath the huge chunk of Meteor, but the red 
energy of destruction seemed to be eating away at the power of Holy, 
pulling it into itself to be used and reused against the Planet. She 
shook her head and looked to Red who padded up close by her legs.

&quot;It&#39;s too late, Holy is having the opposite effect.&quot;

&quot;What about Midgar!&quot; The stuffed mog squeaked from the back, &quot;All the 
people, I had them take refuge in the slums... and now...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s too late to worry about Midgar, we&#39;ve got to worry about the 
Planet.&quot; Red snapped back.

&quot;Holy,&quot; she said softly.

What is good for the Planet.

What is bad for the Planet.

Holy judges this...

Bugenhagen, Red&#39;s grandfather, had told them this not that long ago. It 
was when they had been hunting for the reason why Aerith had gone to the 
City of the Ancients and there they had found the secret she had known 
about - the secret of the ultimate white magic, Holy and that she was 
right - only she alone could summon it as Cetra if only in part. But 
such great magic had cost her life... They&#39;d travelled further, willing 
themselves onward to complete her quest and more than ever before, Tifa 
had been certain - it was never about Cloud and Sephiroth, it was never 
about her pain or Barrett&#39;s past, or about ShinRa. It was all about 
Aerith, the Cetra and the struggle of the Planet to survive.

That&#39;s all this had been for, and always had been. So...

&quot;Holy.&quot; Tifa repeated, &quot;Bugenhagen said that the Planet judges what it 
considers bad for it. That if we were considered bad for the Planet, 
then it would take us from it too.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but not everyone can be bad for it,&quot; Cid said, hanging over the 
steering wheel. She looked back at him with sad, dark eyes.

&quot;Aren&#39;t we all bad for it? The Planet had only one person left in the 
whole world who could speak with it, one very special girl. And in its 
eyes, we, as a race, persecuted her from youth, hunted her in 
adolescence and later, in early adulthood, let her die.&quot; She frowned, 
hand coming up to touch her scar gently in a rubbing motion, &quot;You say 
that, yet we are a bad race. What is there left to believe in for the 
Planet, when we have done such bad things.&quot;

&quot;You sound like you&#39;re going to just stand there and accept it.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong,&quot; she murmured, &quot;I... miss her so much, like losing 
everything and having only bleakness left. But she wouldn&#39;t want me to 
wish for death! That&#39;s not like her... and I&#39;ll fight, I&#39;ll pray until 
the last moment, just like she did... but all I&#39;m saying is... if we&#39;re 
judged bad news, then I can understand it, you know?&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

Tifa turned her dark eyes back to the window as Cloud turned away, 
covering his face with a hand. &quot;After all, she would understand too. 
Hey...&quot; did her eyes betray her? She squinted at the tiny sparkle that 
had just shone across the starboard side and then looked back, surprise 
etched onto her beautiful face, &quot;...what&#39;s that?&quot;

Everyone turned to see what she was pointing at, a flicker of light. It 
was joined by several more, then more, building in crescendo until a 
song was audible, a song that awed the six senses and more. It flooded 
the day, the night and the sky as the light bled from the earth, winding 
its way across the land.

&quot;Life Stream,&quot; Cloud whispered in awe.

Tifa cupped her hands to her mouth.

The light kept on, growing and winding its way over the land, over the 
mountains and through the seas. It kept on coming and coming, each 
strand the memory of a loved one, the feeling of togetherness and faces 
upturned the world over in awe at the sudden force rising up from the 
steam of life, pulsating across the land, filling everything with joy. 
Then it struck where Holy was fighting the Meteor and surged.

It pushed.

It denied.

A million voices cried out into the night, all seeking to live, all 
wishing another chance and with that wish, the power of the life stream 
pushed harder until the Meteor exploded harmlessly in a shower of 
whispers and light fragments, each one drifting down across the sky like 
falling stars.

Tifa uncovered her eyes after the explosion of light had vanished, tears 
falling down her cheeks. Around her, everyone just breathed and the ship 
whirred; the only sounds in the over-awed, dumbstruck silence that 
afflicted them all. She knew she was crying - hadn&#39;t she sworn she&#39;d 
never cry? But this time, it felt so right to cry. It felt right, ever 
since she&#39;d let a gentle voice and quiet but loving eyes get under her 
skin.

This world, she thought as she watched the sky, is such a crazy place. I 
have gone... so far. Zangan would be proud. I think my parents would be 
proud too, of everything I have tried to accomplish. I might not have 
always been successful, but I did well enough. I did enough.

Now if only you had stayed, instead of having to go, then life would be 
perfect.

But I&#39;ll soldier on for you, my flower. I&#39;ll find my way without your 
light to guide me.

...my hero, Aerith.

--------------------------------------

In the far depths of forever, a face tilted up in the water towards the 
showers of light that came down. It was like her dreams, and she heard 
them speaking as if by her shoulder. Her hair was a net that floated as 
she did, or maybe she was flying? It didn&#39;t really matter, the girl 
concluded, closing her eyes as her tears of happiness melded with the 
water, neither one distinguishable from the other.

And she smiled.</pre>
