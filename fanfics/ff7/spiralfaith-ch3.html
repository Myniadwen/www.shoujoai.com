Dreamer Mall:  Pizza Place (Mid Day)


            Now that Yuffie was finally out of school (For summer 
break) she could go on missions with Tifa and Spin.  As for the 
mission, it isn&#146;t going to well, for now.

            &#147;Mmm, good Pizza&#148; Yuffie says mirthfully, &#147;No wonder you 
and Amber fell in love here.&#148;

            &#147;What does that mean?&#148; Spins ask curiously.

            &#147;Nothing, just saying the pizza is good.&#148;  

            Spin looks at Yuffie, and then takes a bite out of her 
pizza. &#147;You&#146;re right.&#148;  

            &#147;So, what do we know about the guy far?&#148; Tifa asks taking 
another bite from her and Yuffie&#146;s slice of pizza.  

            Spin shrugs then eats some more pizza, &#147;Well, we know he 
has scary eyes, and his voice is creepy.&#148;

            &#147;What, you&#146;ve heard his voice&#148; Tifa exclaims standing and 
slamming their hands down.   &#147;When did this happen?&#148;

            &#147;Well,&#148; Spin answers in between bites, &#147; Amber and I where 
Ice Skating and he appeared.&#148;  &#147;Oh and he knew my name,&#148; she notes.      

            &#147;Great, he knows more about us then we know about him!&#148;

            &#147;Well, lets go find out,&#148; Yuffie says, grabbing both of 
them and pulling them behind her. 


Daidouji Residence:


            Spin, Tifa, and Yuffie go to see if Sakura or Tomoyo 
caught the guy&#146;s name, or anything else important.  The guards let 
them in without any trouble; they even know their names (Except 
Yuffie).  When they get to the door, Fuu lets them in happily. This 
time Sakura is fully dressed along with Tomoyo.  

            The two detectives, and Yuffie enter and sit on the one of 
the couches across from Tomoyo and Sakura.  

            &#147;Before we start I have a question, &#147; Tomoyo asks 
cheerfully while pouring some tea.  

            &#147;What would that be?&#148; Spin Replies.

            &#147;First, I hope you don&#146;t mind me recording this,&#148; says 
Tomoyo while pointing over at a camera that was filming the whole 
thing.

            Spin, who is usually hyped up becomes real calm and quit, 
while Yuffie takes over the conversation.  &#147;No that&#146;s fine.&#148;

            Tomoyo looks at Yuffie, &#147;Who are you?&#148;

            &#147;I am Yuffie, Tifa&#146;s, uhh, friend.&#148;  &#147;Any way we have some 
questions too.&#148;

            &#147;Okay, what are they?&#148;  Sakura jumps in.

            &#147;Did he give you a name?&#148;

            &#147;No&#148; the two answer simultaneously.  

            &#147;Hmm, hey Tifa, come here.&#148;  Yuffie starts whispering with 
Tifa, they trade, Ummhums and yeas, them Yuffie looks back over at 
them.  &#147;Hey, would you guys like to come to and play basket ball with 
Spin, her woman, Tifa and me?&#148;

            &#147;Sure&#148; answers Tomoyo.

            Back at the car.

            &#147;Hey you two, I got a page while we where in there,&#148; Tifa 
sighs,&#148;we need o go to headquarters.&#148; 


Green Army Headquarters:  Interrogation Room: 


            They had been called back for a good reason.  Their 
mystery man is there as they got the page, and refuses to talk wit 
anyone but them.        

            Tifa takes a seat and then Spin does the same.    Yuffie 
then takes a seat on Tifa&#146;s lap (Do to shortage of chairs) and raps 
her arms around her.

            &#147;So, what&#146;s is your&#146; name&#148; starts Spin.

            &#147;Kerek Quenthous, and those two are.&#148; 

            &#147;Oh, I am Tifa and this little brat is Yuffie,&#148; sighs Tifa 
before Yuffie sticks her tongue out at her.  

            Spin sighs at her friends before continuing, &#147;Any way back 
to the point (you).&#148;

            &#147;Do you really have dreams of the &#147;Waking&#148; World?&#148;

            &#147;No.&#148; he says simply, staring at them with his Ice-cold 
gaze.  &#147;I don&#146;t have dreams, they are memories.&#148;

            &#147;Memories,&#148; repeats Tifa.

            &#147;So you use to live in the &#147;Waking&#148; World,&#148; Yuffie asks.

            &#147;No.&#148;

            &#147;Then how do you have memories,&#146; questions Spin.

            Kerek pulls out a cigarette before starting his short 
explanation, &#147;I have no clues, all I know is they aren&#146;t dreams.&#148;  

            &#147;Then, how old where you in the first &#147;Memory&#148; Spin 
continues.

            &#147;I was fourteen. I think.&#148;

            &#147;So..&#148;

            (Friday, May10) New King Penguin Park: Basket Ball Court:

            They all show up on time (that was set at night the day 
before) and get ready to play by changing in the bathrooms (but not 
without a few embarrassing moment (Mostly Spin who is shy about her 
body)). 

            On the Court

            To play they decide to do play as couples, meaning teams 
are: 

Spin and Amber
Tifa and Yuffie
Sakura and Tomoyo

            &#147;Okay lets play already, you all can kiss later, lets do 
it,&#148; Yuffie taunts.

            &#147;Only taunt if you can play Yuffie&#148; Spin retorts, grabbing 
the ball before getting ready to start.

            &#147;You know I am the best (which is actually true)&#148; She 
laughs, &#147;Hey Tifa, I got Spin.&#148;

            &#147;Okay, camera is set up,&#148; yells Tomoyo from the sidelines 
before she joins the game.  Hearing those words both Tifa and Spin 
tense up.  They didn&#146;t like being recorded, but the others didn&#146;t 
mind.

            &#147;Lets go already,&#148; yells Yuffie, grabbing Spins attention. 

            They check, then Spin passes the ball over to Amber and&#133;

             

Dreams-

What is a dream, I wonder.

Some say dreams are doorways to other worlds,

Others think they are what you truly want,

While still others think that they have their own world.

Could we ever figure it out?

Or are dreams there to show us what we used to be.
