Could have been a small town,
And when the rain would fall down
I&#39;d just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I&#39;d end up happy
I would pray...

...I do what it takes until I touch the sky...
I&#39;ll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away...
-Kelly Clarkson

--------------------------------------

&quot;Dear Diary... it is February, we have spent a month or more waiting for 
Cloud to wake up...&quot;

She cradled the little purple clad book, writing gently on the paper 
with a scratch-scratch of her pen so the words inscribed there were as 
solid as each one she could make them. She realised at some point she 
had started to cry, a lonely sort of crying that she was unsure if she 
knew how to prevent. It was cold, cold tears unlike the hot ones that 
normally accompanied wild swings of emotion. The tears dripped sometimes 
from her chin and every now and then she was forced to stop and wipe 
them before they smudged on the paper and made the blue ink fail and run 
into little rivers of illegibility.

She knew.

Ever since she&#39;d woken from the terrible blackness that had swallowed 
her at the mindless rage infecting his hands, covered with bruises that 
Yuffie had been crying over, trying to tend, she had known. With pain in 
her heart and her head, she gathered what strength she could to take the 
pain away but only the sharp stabbing agony in her heart remained, and 
she had known. Terrible lurking fear over her shoulder that woke her 
each night with a scream, bolting upright as Cloud refused to wake from 
the coma that a guilty Tifa had placed him in under her own fit of rage, 
each time she felt sweat dampen between her breasts and stick her night 
clothes to her, she knew the terrible agony, she knew.

Each loud noise that called from the hallway, be it Barrett hollering 
after a bigger breakfast, Cid cursing Yuffie when she kept cheating him 
from his &#39;smokes money&#39; during the long hours or Tifa coming to knock on 
her door gently, asking in a sheepish and very quiet voice if she was 
alright; each of these sounds made her jump and clutch the book to her, 
pressing it to her chest and the pain that was a phantom bloomed where 
bruises had once dented on her delicate skin.

She was alright though.

She only knew. Knowing did nothing to stop the clamping of muscles 
around her throat, to cut off the stream of words she didn&#39;t understand 
well enough. Knowing didn&#39;t stop her from covering her shaking hands 
when she crept out to eat dinner. Knowing didn&#39;t make her any less 
vigilant in taking care of his health as he slept and wrestled demons 
that she couldn&#39;t help him with as long as he lingered from her reach. 
Knowing didn&#39;t still the voice of the Planet, louder, softer, warmer and 
colder by turns. Knowing, as with all things, did nothing to aid her. 
Only settled her on the precipice of action.

&quot;Not long,&quot; she whispered and the tears started again, so she rocked 
back and forth.

She had to go away.

She had to go and leave them behind.

Her gravest duty yet, one that had come for her with the wind outside 
the faceless building that had tied her life down to ShinRa, a fate 
which had set her free and given her wings to fly, fly away and find her 
way, her truths in this lonely world. She would not refuse such a task, 
even the sound of her mothers voice finally carried to her and she could 
not refuse... because she was the only one. She was all that was left, a 
remnant of a remnant.

She&#39;d looked, of course, fruitlessly hunting for other Cetra but finding 
only echoes of those who had passed away maybe only years before she had 
come looking for them, or those who had submerged themselves into the 
human blood line and gene pool that their magic was diluted. She 
suspected, without ever having evidence to back such a claim up, that 
Yuffie was in some small part of Cetra heritage more so than the others, 
for she commanded healing magic well enough without aid of materia, a 
talent that cropped up only in Cetra bloodlines. But such power was 
distant, cold comfort to someone like she.

So when the stars were alight in the evening, she crept out to search 
them for her answers, knowing they would guide her. But they always 
pointed there, always pointed so distant. She knew she had little choice 
now, she knew time was up. The time for action was upon her.

She knew.

And because she knew, holding the diary with shaking hands, she wept.

---------------------------------

Tifa lowered her hand from knocking, drawing back at the sounds of 
weeping from inside the room.

Behind her, Yuffie held a tray laden with a bowl that held a thick 
vegetable soup and a crusty roll, her expression mixed as she too caught 
the delicate strains of the Ancient&#39;s sobbing. She looked down at the 
bowl, &quot;Tifa, is she alright? She hasn&#39;t been quite the same since we 
came back from the temple... We&#39;ve been here for an awfully long time 
now. Cloud&#39;s not looking better either.&quot;

&quot;I know, I don&#39;t want to believe I put him in a condition like that,&quot; 
Tifa took the tray and nodded that they should go back to the kitchens 
of the hotel that the owner had agreed to let to them almost entirely 
upon hearing that Tifa knew Zack&#39;s family. &quot;Aerith said that she thinks 
some part of his soul fled deep inside him, not wanting to understand 
the reality of the situation, but she&#39;ll pull him out when she can 
complete her magic rituals.&quot;

&quot;Then why is she crying?&quot;

&quot;...&quot; Her dark eyes studied the floor numbly as they walked together, &quot;I 
don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;... Hey, um... if you two get married, can I be a bridesmaid?&quot;

The question was so from the blue that it almost jolted Tifa from her 
feet and then she laughed, seeing Yuffie&#39;s eager expression as they 
slowed to a halt by the door that opened into the kitchen. &quot;Married?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re in love, right? I bet being asked would cheer her up... 
you said so yourself, Aerith&#39;s the one for you. You should consider it!&quot;

&quot;...married...&quot; Tifa rolled the word around in her head. Okay, so it 
wasn&#39;t conventional, but at this stage nothing much was.

They were taking on a huge corporation and winning, they were saving the 
planet, a fire wolf spoke the human tongue better than Barrett, a human 
being, did; an Ancient travelled with their party to combat the darkness 
in Cloud and Sephiroth, a genetic experiment gone wrong, was fighting 
them every step of the way. So love? Wasn&#39;t that to be cherished?

&quot;Plus, I&#39;m an only child and you guys are like, well...&quot; Yuffie&#39;s eyes 
shone as she bent her head, looking awkward, toe scuffing the 
floorboards as the betraying sock slid down to her ankle, &quot;...like 
sisters to me and... I always wanted to be a bridesmaid...&quot;

&quot;Marriage... I think that&#39;s the best idea I&#39;ve heard in a long time.&quot;

&quot;Really? Well... it&#39;s Valentine&#39;s Day soon, but even better, I know its 
Aerith-sama&#39;s birthday tomorrow!&quot; The wutai ninja bounced and clapped 
her hands, &quot;So let&#146;s do something amazing for her! Flowers, dinner, 
starlight walk!&quot;

&quot;Do...we have the gil for that? I mean,&quot; Tifa juggled the tray awkwardly 
whilst trying to itch her cheek, &quot;This place isn&#39;t precisely cheap on 
the gil wallet.&quot;

&quot;I can solve that.&quot;

&quot;Do I even want to ask how?&quot;

&quot;Do you want to continue to sleep at night?&quot;

Tifa made a face, &quot;Then that&#39;s a &#39;no Tifa, stay grey hair free&#39; answer.&quot;

Just as Yuffie was laughing, the door banged outwards, one to each 
girl&#39;s face as Barrett stomped through with Cid hot on his heels. The 
language they were both using was foul beyond all credence, and Cid 
seemed to be quite angry at Barrett. The taller man was backing off and 
muttering about &#39;cheatin&#39; cards, foo&#39;&#39;. When the door finally swung back 
into place there was an angry red mark on Yuffie&#39;s forehead, a hand 
cupped to her nose which was bleeding. On the opposite side, Tifa slowly 
drew the tray down from her chest where it had been catapulted - the 
thick vegetable soup dripping down her front into a fragrant puddle on 
the floor, still steaming hot.

&quot;You blathering idiots,&quot; Yuffie scowled.

&quot;Oh hey, look, it&#39;s th&#39; shrimp.&quot; Barrett grinned and even Cid stopped to 
guffaw at the welt rising just under the green headband Yuffie wore as a 
mark of her clan affiliation. Then they both wiped smiles from their 
faces as they saw the darkening face of Tifa and the ruined bowl of 
food.

&quot;Barrett... Cid...&quot; she murmured in a deceptive tone of voice.

&quot;It was his fault,&quot; they both said in unison, pointing to the other.

&quot;Oh Tifa, your clothes,&quot; Yuffie sighed, &quot;We&#39;ll get you something to wear 
whilst they get washed. Something special?&quot;

&quot;Special?&quot; Cid butted in, &quot;Special fer what?&quot;

Tifa blushed and looked away, so the nin&#146; girl piped up in an excited 
tone of voice, &quot;Tifa&#39;s gonna ask Aerith to marry her tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Woah,&quot; muttered the pilot, but grinned from ear to ear. Probably having 
some perverted thought, Tifa noted coolly, but she glanced quickly to 
Barrett. He seemed a bit surprised, but not disgusted by it.

&quot;Barrett,&quot; she said softly, her voice hovering close to a questioning 
tone.

&quot;Go for it Teef,&quot; he rumbled. Tears brimmed in her eyes suddenly. &quot;Ah, 
no cryin&#39;, y&#39;hear? You&#39;ve always been like a lil&#39; sister t&#39;me. So, if 
this makes y&#39;happy, go for it. I&#39;ll crack the heads of anyone who don&#39;t 
agree, got it? &#39;Sides, you dont know what&#39;ll happen when Cloud wakes up, 
right? That spiky headed jerk and his Sephiroth &#39;disability&#39; - whatever&#133; 
You gotta live for the now, you gotta be happy. So be happy, Teef. And 
make that girl in there happy too, cuz&#39; she cries too much, ya hear what 
I&#39;m sayin&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Of course I will,&quot; she laughed in relief, wiping at her eyes. The soup 
going cold on her ample bosom hardly bothered her at all now. Awkwardly 
the four of them stood in contemplation, until a deep, gravel-velvet 
voice said from somewhere in the shadows;

&quot;A happy ending?&quot;

Tifa clung to the ground by sheer willpowe, but Yuffie climbed a foot 
into the air with her surprised jump, much the same as Cid did whilst 
Barrett scowled and ppointed his gun arm at the shadow out of sheer 
habit. From the draping shadows Vincent slowly drew, his dark hair 
obscuring his face partially as it hung.

&quot;Vincent, goddamn freakin&#39; vampire...fu-&quot;

&quot;Stop creeping around!&quot; Yuffie snapped on top of Cid&#39;s outburst, which 
had just been clamouring to an interesting expletive, which he spat out 
anyway if in a lower tone of voice. &quot;You could give people heart 
attacks.&quot;

&quot;You? Heart?&quot; Grinned Cid from around his &#39;smoke&#39;.

&quot;Come here and say that, old man,&quot; she muttered.

&quot;Kids, kids,&quot; Tifa said in exasperation and when they both gave her 
identical looks of horror, she laughed. It wasn&#39;t long until everyone 
else was laughing too, helplessly so - apart from Vincent, because a 
smile might ruin that image he had going for him, so he melted back into 
the shadows smoothly and left. But the others laughed together, the soup 
forgotten and a plan to woo the Ancient into saying yes had begun.

----------------------------------

Aerith was replacing the cloth over the symbol she had marked in candle 
wax on Cloud&#39;s forehead when the door opened. She hurriedly put 
everything back into place and was only a little surprised when Tifa 
came in, surprised because of the change of clothes.

Ditching the black and white for one evening, Tifa had pulled on a 
comfortable set of loose jeans-like trousers and a dark blue shirt which 
hugged her snugly over her chest. Her hair was much the same, but in one 
hand she held a bunch of flowers. These she offered to the ancient with 
a blush.

&quot;What&#39;s the occasion?&quot; Aerith murmured, holding them and looking into 
their sunny faces with delight - she dared not ask where she had found 
early flowers in such a desolate place, especially at this time of year.

&quot;Come... I... date with me?&quot; Tifa mumbled, pressing hands together 
nervously. &quot;Please? I would be honoured...that is...&quot;

&quot;A date?&quot; Aerith laughed and put the flowers down, &quot;Alright... where?&quot;

&quot;Dinner,&quot; the fighter looked relieved. &quot;A picnic really, under the 
stars. I know it&#39;s not much but...&quot;

&quot;No... It sounds perfect.&quot; She stood up, holding the flowers close to 
her, &quot;Anything you suggest sounds perfect to me.&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m glad you feel that way,&quot; Tifa smiled, and pushed the door open a 
little more, &quot;Shall we?&quot;

Then she was taking the cool, scarred hand of Tifa from hard battles, 
pressing the knuckles to her lips with a vague trace of pink in her 
cheeks and murmuring into the skin, sure enough of this moment, to say, 
&quot;We shall.&quot;

----------------------------------

The picnic had been beyond words, perfect.

Together, the two girls, both perfectly imperfect in their own way, lay 
out beside each other, holding hands and staring up at the sky with 
scattered remnants of food strewn on the blanket and the wicker basket 
left forgotten as with wide eyes, each one drank in the world together.

Together.

The taller girl was beautiful in the way of the here, the now; with dark 
eyes and darker hair, long limbs and a confident manner that belied her 
dark mood swings and desperate loneliness. Her mouth was curved for this 
night, as every moment spent with her love, into a small smile, a 
comfortable, happy smile.

The shorter girl was beautiful in the way of the unknown, the mysterious 
love, the forgotten soul; her hair of golden brown and large eyes of 
brilliant viridian. She exuded energy and life, sheer vibrant life that 
sang with every motion, rippled in the sweet clarity of her voice. 
Tonight she lay in the grass, hoping for there to be no tomorrow, hoping 
for nothing to ever carry on.

&quot;We could... stay here and just forget the world,&quot; Tifa said softly. Her 
eyes reflected the stars it seemed, &quot;The stars are beautiful, the world 
is lovely, my life is... complete.&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t stay here,&quot; Aerith murmured sadly, gripping Tifa&#39;s hand 
tightly, &quot;We have obligations. We made promises.&quot;

&quot;Promises I can break, if it meant I couldn&#39;t leave this perfect 
moment.&quot;

&quot;And what about life? Life is a series of moments, a series of 
coincidences, happenstances that all add to experience, to life, to fate 
itself. You would sidestep all of that?&quot;

&quot;Yes. But you wouldn&#39;t stay with me if I did?&quot;

&quot;...&quot; The shorter girl closed her eyes, &quot;No. I... couldn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot;

Tifa turned on her side to look at her, mouth curving gently. It was 
then that Aerith knew one more truth, one final truth and sadly she 
smiled back at her. The fighter continued in a softer tone, gentle as 
the hand which came up to cup her cheek, &quot;So... how about we stay here 
as long as we can then?&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;ll stay as long as I can, for you,&quot; she whispered back.

The wind was heavier now than it had been, cold and harsh across their 
skin and raising goose bumps, so Aerith sat up, setting her 
determination as she eyes the scattered food that would go to feeding 
birds and eventually plant life alike. The night was dark and she 
suddenly felt as though she needed to go elsewhere. But Tifa was upright 
before her, offering her an arm as she tucked the blanket around the 
other.

&quot;You look cold,&quot; she said, &quot;Even with that cute jacket.&quot;

&quot;I am a bit,&quot; Aerith admitted and took the arm, rising to her feet.

Together, arm in arm as lovers do, they walked back to the hotel. The 
grass tickled gently and together they softly spoke of things that were 
and weren&#39;t, that could be but weren&#39;t entirely and she was glad of the 
company, of the friendship, of the love she never outright demanded to 
have returned and she was content. This was contentment, she told 
herself, a warm glow in the pit of her stomach that said without words 
how happy she was.

And how much she knew she had to lose if she failed her duty.

Tifa held the door open for her and she slipped inside, rubbing her 
arms. Down the long hallway, Tifa&#39;s room was two doors up from her own - 
Aerith had been recovering so they&#39;d all taken single rooms to avoid 
anything untoward happening, especially as they&#39;d spent so long tied 
down in one place because of Cloud&#39;s slow recovery. When Tifa paused by 
her door, Aerith smiled.

&quot;This is goodnight then,&quot; Tifa said, putting her hand on the handle. 
&quot;I&#39;ll see you in the morning?&quot;

&quot;Wait...&quot; she said, putting her hand over Tifa&#39;s. &quot;...I don&#39;t want to be 
alone tonight. Can I sleep with you?&quot;

&quot;I... dreams?&quot;

&quot;Not just that... I... want... to be with you,&quot; she stumbled over it and 
blushed, to her very eartips no doubt, but grateful the dark hallway hid 
it well. There was silence bar the indrawn and shaking breath of Tifa, 
as if she hardly dared to believe she had heard those words spoken to 
her.

&quot;I don&#39;t mind,&quot; Tifa said slowly, voice cracking and wavering with 
uncertainty.

So once Tifa had gathered her wits enough to fit the key into the lock 
with heavily shaking hands, Aerith followed her into the warmth of a 
dark room heated only by a small brazier in the corner. Unlike many 
hotels in Midgar, Gongaga didn&#39;t have electricity, so lived a simple 
life with simple means, something Aerith truly appreciated. Except for 
times like this, when the room didn&#39;t seem any warmer than the hallway 
outside it.

Suddenly hands were chafing her arms, trying to bring blood up to warm 
her, suffuse her and she knew it was Tifa just behind her, stood very 
close. Close enough that she dimly realised that her shoulders pressed 
into the chest of the taller, well endowed girl. Blush rising, she 
looked over her shoulder.

&quot;I have a nighty you can borrow,&quot; Tifa murmured, lowering her eyes and 
letting go. She moved to the bed and tugged out her backpack.

Do it.

Telling herself to do it and actually doing it were two different things 
entirely. So as Tifa rummaged for her belongings, she started to remove 
her jacket, then her boots which clattered to the floor. Tifa mumbled 
something, digging deeper into the backpack. Grateful she wasn&#39;t being 
watched, Aerith swallowed and started undoing the buttons. Soon, without 
much to hold it to her, being of such a boyishly slim body, it slid to 
the floor and she stepped out of it. Before Tifa could produce anything 
remotely nightwear like, she crossed the distance and pressed herself 
this time, to her back. Naked.

Tifa stiffened.

&quot;Aerith?&quot;

&quot;...I want, to be with you,&quot; she repeated, stressing it more.

The girl in her arms, broken, imperfectly perfect to her in every way 
possible, turned to look upon her, heat on her face, and she kissed her. 
She kissed her softly, despite the tears she knew that would come and 
was thrilled when she was kissed back, felt arms slide about her and 
guide her blindly to the bed where after moments of being alone, she was 
rejoined once again by Tifa, but this time she could feel the dimpled 
flesh of the scar rub against her own skin, the minute nicks and cuts as 
she ran her fingers up the strong arms that swept about her willingly, 
loving- arms to which she surrendered herself.

With the first kiss that left her lips for the curve of her neck she 
heard the whisper return; &quot;I want to be with you always,&quot; and with the 
tears came the laughter. Delighting in the new sensation as her heart 
beat wildly on her fragile ribcage.

Their touches were unsure, their words soft so no one else could hear 
and pressed close together, she saved the night for Tifa Lockhart 
alone...

-----------------------------------

Grey dawn betrayed her.

She was dressed and sat on the edge of the bed, turning the red materia 
which Tifa had given her a long time ago over and over in her hands. The 
fighter, the beautiful girl who had given her stars and delight, joy and 
love all in one tightly wrapped up heart felt night, lay sleeping. She 
was always a heavy sleeper when they slept close together, dead to the 
world because she was close by.

Aerith had already unhooked all of her materia, set aside her potions 
and baubles, given back the precious armaments they had laden her with 
for her health and now only she and the weapon Tifa had uncovered from 
the soil inside the Temple of Ages, the Princess Guard, remained.

She spoke quietly, knowing nothing could rouse the sleeping woman - not 
a girl, a woman. Last night had proven them both capable of owning such 
a title.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. You said a long time ago that I stopped a clock for you, but 
mine has been ticking down until this moment. Somewhere in the North, 
that&#39;s where I have to go. Please, wait for Cloud to wake up, wait for 
him. When he&#39;s awake, then you may come and find me, because I&#39;ll be 
ready... it&#39;ll all be ready. I&#39;ll make you proud. I&#39;ll stop him...&quot; 
tears spilled again and she clasped her hand hard about the materia.

&quot;For us. Because for the first time, I have something to fight for. 
Friends, you... I&#39;ll fight for it. I&#39;m not strong, Tifa, I know I&#39;m not. 
Look at me... I couldn&#39;t snap a chopstick if I tried... but inside, 
where my heart is. I&#39;ll build a fortress so he can&#39;t get in and give you 
a key. I&#39;ll find a way, you&#39;ll see. I&#39;ll find a way where no one else 
can.&quot;

She touched the pale face of Tifa Lockhart.

&quot;I&#39;ll be with you.&quot;

...and into the grey dawn, Aerith Gainsborough left.</pre>
