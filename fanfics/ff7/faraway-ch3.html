<h1>Far Away to Eternity (part 3 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff7/faraway-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Chapter two! I was forced to listen to T.A.T.U. as punishment for not 
writing this faster. My pain is indescribable. Onward, to the fic. Oh, 
and I know that the &quot;current&quot; party, i.e., Cloud, Barret and Red meet 
Yuffie and fight her, but I just can&#146;t resist letting Aeris and Tifa 
meet her first! ^^ I&#146;m sorry I&#146;m altering the script slightly. ;_; 
Forgive me. 
 
------------------------------
 
Aeris and Tifa walked toward Junon, and Tifa was immensely grateful that 
Aeris had stopped asking her questions.
 
That was, until they ran into a battle.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

Tifa quirked her eyebrow at what seemed to be a young girl dressed in a 
very unique outfit. She wore a midriff sleeveless green shirt, and khaki 
shorts that had one button undone at the top. On one arm, she had an 
enormous arm-guard, and in her hand, she held what looked like a huge 
steel pinwheel. A khaki-colored cloth covered the bottom half of her 
face, and Tifa surmised that the young girl fancied herself to be a 
ninja of some sort.

&quot;Give me your Materia, and you won&#146;t get hurt!&quot; The girl said, her brown 
eyes hardening. Tifa smiled a little, amused at the girl&#146;s confidence.

&quot;Get hurt? Are you going to hurt us?&quot; Even though her voice was 
confident, Tifa automatically tensed for battle, standing in front of 
Aeris protectively. She doubted the girl would be a match for her, but 
she certainly didn&#146;t need Aeris to get taken hostage by the small ninja.

&quot;Yeah!&quot; the girl proclaimed, her voice muffled by the cloth.

&quot;Is that so?&quot; Aeris said. She stepped from behind Tifa, holding her 
staff in front of her. Tifa frowned slightly, but ignored her.

&quot;Yeah! I can kick your butts, you old hags!&quot; Tifa twitched slightly, 
clenching her fists. She saw Aeris tighten her hold on her staff out of 
the corner of her eye.

&quot;Old hags? Big words for such a little girl.&quot;

&quot;Little girl?! Listen, you old broad, last time a guy said that to me, 
he got his ass whopped Shinobi style! You don&#146;t want to mess with me!&quot;
 
&quot;You shouldn&#146;t talk that way, young lady, &quot;Aeris said calmly, gazing at 
the ninja. &quot;It&#146;s not very becoming.&quot; 

&quot;Listen. I don&#146;t have time for any stupid speeches, so shut up and give 
me the Materia, ok? I don&#146;t want to end up hurting anyone.&quot; She moved 
into a fighting position, glaring at the two women. Tifa scoffed, fed up 
with the girl&#146;s arrogance.

&quot;We&#146;re not afraid of you. Now please move, because we&#146;re running late.&quot; 
She barely had time to finish her sentence when a shuriken flew toward 
her face. With her quick instincts, she moved toward the side in time, 
and the small weapon flew past her, embedding itself in a tree nearby.

&quot;Hey, you&#146;re faster than I thought, you old fogey! Come on, you don&#146;t 
want to break anything! Just give up!&quot;

A steady tic started to develop in Tifa&#146;s jaw, and she got into a 
crouching position.

&quot;Since you&#146;re such a tough kid, come at me. Let&#146;s see what you can do.&quot; 
Aeris tapped Tifa on the shoulder.

&quot;Um Tifa?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Do you think that&#146;s...wise?&quot;

&quot;She&#146;s a kid, Aeris. How bad can she be?&quot;

&quot;Famous last words...&quot; Aeris said in a sing-song voice.

Tifa shook her head, and stared over at the ninja, her wine-red eyes 
narrowing into slits.

Sensei always said, &#145;Keep your eyes on the enemy.&#146; Tune out everything 
around you Tif. Watch her...

For a moment, the only sound was that of the wind whistling through the 
trees. Even Aeris was quiet for the time being, her eyes flickering over 
to Tifa.

The ninja ran at Tifa and jumped, throwing her weapon at the martial 
artist. It whizzed through the air, and Tifa rolled to one side, dodging 
the projectile. 

Tifa heard the girl cry out, &quot;Fire!&quot; and she blanched, hopping to her 
feet.

&quot;Ice!&quot;

The two attacks hit each other full speed, and dissipated into steam, 
causing a veil of mist to obscure both of the fighters&#146; vision.

A small shuriken whizzed through the air and nicked Tifa across the 
face, and others soon followed after, causing shallow cuts to appear 
against her pale skin.

Find out where they&#146;re coming from. Listen.

Tifa grounded her heels into the dirt, listening carefully for any 
noises that betrayed the ninja&#146;s location.

She heard the barely audible rustle of cloth behind her turned around, 
preparing to knock the daylights out of the girl...

...And then she remembered something.

It might be Aeris... I forgot she was here! I could call out for her, but 
then the kid will find out where I am...what should I do? I could wait for 
the mist to clear, but by that time, the kid will have turned me into 
ribbons...wait, what&#146;s that noise?

Tifa blinked and then jumped away from a yellow blur hurtling towards 
her. When she had gained her composure, she smiled slightly.

I really should give Aeris more credit...

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

The &#145;mystery ninja&#146; cocked her head when she heard what sounded like 
distant trotting from behind her. She spun around, and made a very 
un-ninja like squeal as a Chocobo with a small Mog jockey bounded into 
her, knocking her to her feet.  As soon as she managed to get up, Tifa 
was on her, performing her Limit Break at the bat of an eyelid.

&quot;Beat Rush!&quot; As she finished her Limit, she felt a rush of newfound 
energy, and finished the girl off with a whirling kick.

&quot;Somersault!&quot;

Needless to say, the ninja was out for the count.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

Cloud, Red, and Barret had arrived shortly after Tifa had defeated of 
the ninja, and Cloud walked over to the rattled girl, nudging her with 
the tip of his boot.

&quot;Hey.&quot;

The young woman, still slightly disorientated, glared up at Cloud and 
hopped to her feet quickly.

&quot;You spiky-headed jerk! One more time, let&#146;s go one more time!&quot;

Cloud quirked an eyebrow at her and frowned, his Mako enhanced eyes 
darkening somewhat.

&quot;Not interested.&quot;

The ninja gawked at him in disbelief, and then smirked, crossing her 
arms.

&quot;Thinkin&#146; of running away?&quot; She stomped her foot in a childlike manner 
and huffed indignantly, her cheeks puffing slightly. &quot;Stay and fight! 
FIGHT, I said!&quot;

Cloud shrugged his shoulders and rolled his eyes, turning his back on 
her. The small girl glared daggers at his retreating form.

&quot;C&#39;mon... What&#39;s the matter? You&#39;re pretty scared of me, huh!?&quot;

Cloud tried, and succeeded, in not laughing at her.

&quot;Petrified...&quot; he muttered sarcastically. The girl did not catch it.

&quot;Hmm, just as I thought. What do you expect with my skills? Good luck to 
you guys too! If you feel up to it, we can go another round. Later!&quot;

She started to walk away, and Cloud scratched his head, staring at Tifa.

&#145;Did you hit her too hard?&#146; he mouthed to her. Tifa bit down a giggle 
and shook her head.

The ninja turned around to face them again.

&quot;I&#146;m gonna leave! I mean it!&quot;

Cloud could have cared less, but Aeris tapped his shoulder.

&quot;Cloud?&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot;

&quot;She&#146;s just a girl...but she might be useful...you think we should let her 
join?&quot; Tifa blanched and rounded on Aeris, putting her hands on her 
hips.

&quot;Are you nuts? She tried to kill us!&quot;

Cloud looked up to the sky and gave Tifa a helpless look, and Tifa 
slumped her shoulders, sensing defeat.

&quot;Wait a second!&quot;  Cloud called out to the ninja. Tifa could&#146;ve sworn she 
saw the girl&#146;s eyes light up a little. Cloud motioned for the others to 
follow him, and they walked toward the ninja. The girl grinned, looking 
quite smug.

&quot;What is it; you still have somethin&#39; for me? ...Hmmm. So is that it? I 
know you want my help because I&#39;m so good! You want me to go with you?&quot;

Cloud kept himself from groaning. The girl was so arrogant, it was 
amazing.

&quot;That&#146;s right,&quot; he mumbled, shaking his head a little when Tifa gave him 
a dark look.

The girl closed her eyes, seeming pleased with herself.

&quot;Heh heh... thought so. You put me in a spot. Hmm, what should I do? 
But, if you want me that bad, I can&#39;t refuse. All right! I&#39;ll go with 
you!&quot;

Cloud looked relieved.

&quot;Let&#146;s hurry.&quot; The others followed after them, and the ninja blinked.

&quot;Wait! I haven&#39;t even told you my name...I&#39;m Yuffie! Good to meetcha!&quot;

Tifa heard the girl call for them and simply increased her pace. She 
felt a headache coming on.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

Cloud yawned a little and looked up to the night sky before stretching 
his arms. They had decided to camp for the night, and a couple of tents 
had been put up around a modest fire. The others were seated around it, 
including the new girl, a ninja who went by the name of Yuffie Kisaragi. 
Tifa kept sneaking glances at Yuffie, watching her carefully. There was 
something...odd about her. Yuffie didn&#146;t seem to notice however, and moved 
to sit next to Aeris, who had finally stopped fussing over the wounds 
Tifa had received in the battle.

She has a mommy complex. And if she was so worried, she shouldn&#146;t have 
convinced Cloud to let that kid join us! Tifa thought, cracking her 
knuckles. Yuffie glanced over at the disgruntled martial artist.

&quot;Y&#146;know, you really shouldn&#146;t do that. It sounds really gross.&quot;

Tifa gave her a withering look, and Yuffie blanched, unconsciously 
moving closer to Aeris.

&quot;Gawd, sorry.&quot; Aeris giggled from beside her.

&quot;Tifa isn&#146;t really mean. She just doesn&#146;t quite trust you yet,&quot; she 
murmured to Yuffie.

Tifa rolled her eyes and yelped when Yuffie punched her in the arm.

&quot;What? You little...&quot; Yuffie raised her hands in defense.

&quot;Whoa, whoa! I was just tryin&#146; to get your attention! I want a rematch!&quot;

&quot;...A rematch?&quot;

&quot;Yeah!&quot; The girl pumped her fist in the air energetically, and Tifa gave 
her a confused look.

&quot;Um...I don&#146;t really...do rematches.&quot;

Yuffie frowned and opened her mouth to say something, but Tifa raised 
her hand in the air before she could speak.

&quot;And it&#146;s not because I&#146;m afraid. What&#146;s done...is done, ok? I don&#146;t want 
any hard feelings.&quot; She saw Aeris smile at her from behind Yuffie&#146;s 
back.

Yuffie put her finger to her chin, seemingly contemplating what Tifa 
said.

&quot;Well...I still think you&#146;re scared.&quot;

Both Tifa and Aeris shook their heads.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

&quot;Well,&quot; Cloud said, looking everyone over, &quot;I think...that Yuffie should 
stay with Aeris and Tifa. You girls don&#146;t mind right?&quot;

Aeris smiled and Tifa forced herself to do something other than frown.

&quot;That&#146;s fine!&quot; Aeris chirped.

&quot;Just us girls...&quot; mumbled Tifa.

&quot;Alright, you two old ladies! Let&#146;s head to Junon!&quot; said Yuffie, 
spinning around a little.

Cloud smiled weakly, gave Tifa a pitying look, and he, Red, and Barret 
walked off.

&quot;You&#146;re in charge Tifa! Take care of yourself!&quot;

Tifa started to crack her knuckles again.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
End of chapter two

Wee, everyone loves Miserable! Tifa.  Right, right?  I didn&#146;t get to 
Junon in this chapter, but next chapter I will!
