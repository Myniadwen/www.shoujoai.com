<h1>I'll Be Waiting For You... (part 2 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/donniefisco.html">Donnie Fisco</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff7/waiting-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The Training Center in Gold Saucer was always busy, but today was something
special. Cloud was on a winning streak. He had defeated 32 opponents straight.
No one had ever gotten past 7, and this was the biggest event in all of Gold
Saucer, everyone was attending.
The many monsters the automated programming sent at him had fell quickly. His
first opponent, a lone Zolkater was easily dispatched with one swipe of his
massive sword. Right afterwards two Headbombers appeared out of thin air. The
yellow penguins never knew what hit them. A blast of intense heat slammed them
against the far wall, victim of one of Cloud&#39;s variety of magical skills. This
process continued for atleast and hour and a half, Cloud victorious. It was
obvious though, he was tiring. His magic power was depleting and barrages of
attacks had weakened him considerably.
***********************************
The crowd had gathered to it&#39;s peak in the stands and were waiting for his next
opponent, when a small green creature stepped up. It had a brown shawl, and
carried a small lantern. The cane it carried was just about it&#39;s full height,
3&#39; 5&quot;.
Cloud: &quot;Tonberry...&quot;
At that, Cloud raised his sword in the air, and got into his battle stance. The
crowd was screaming and yelling by this time, and Cloud was more than
overconfident. He had defeated many of these, maybe even over one hundred in
his life time.
Before the battle could officially begin, Cloud looked over to the front row.
It had been only a few months since the defeat of Sephiroth, yet he only kept
in touch with Tifa. He spotted her run in and sit down in the corner, a smile
on her face, as always. Plopping down next to her in a pile of fur, teeth, and
claws was Nanaki.
Tifa: &quot;Go Honey! You can do it!&quot;
When everything had calmed down and Meteor was recovered from, Tifa and Cloud
had become close... too close for Cloud. Aeris had only been gone for a short
time. Besides, he was never good at this, everyone knew that... except Tifa...
or did she? He couldn&#39;t be sure.
Tifa: &quot;I believe in you Cloud! You can beat that nasty Tonberry!&quot;
Cloud couldn&#39;t think of anything to say. The blonde didn&#39;t really want her to
be here. He just nodded, then turned back to the Tonberry who was already
plodding towards him.
Cloud: &quot;Damn it! He&#39;s half way here! Double time now!&quot;
He raised his hand in the air, and the glinting green materia sparkled in his
palm. A green gas engulfed the Tonberry and the energy ignited. This sent the
Tonberry flying, unfortunately straight at Cloud. The tiny creature recovered
quickly, and stood up. It&#39;s knife was raised in the air.
Out of nowhere, he felt a searing pain in his back. A second Tonberry had been
there the whole time, he had not even noticed it!
Cloud: &quot;Holy Sh...!&quot;
Before Cloud even finished his sentence, the Tonberries struck with a vengance.
The daggers slashed Cloud mercilessly over and over again. When the creatures
finished, he was on the ground with a pool of blood around him already. The
deep gashes in his chest and back oozed the thick red liquid.
The automatic sensors saw the battle was over, and an impenetrable cage fell
down on top of the Tonberries. Everyone in the crowd was silent. The ultimate
warrior had been defeated, what could any of them say?
Tifa&#39;s eyes widened as she finally realized the severity of the situation. The
tears formed at the corners of her eyes, and a small trickle ran down her face.
Tifa: &quot;C... Cl... CLOUD!!!!! NO!!!!&quot;
As quickly as her legs could carry her, she dashed over to his motionless body.
Tifa was afraid to look down at him, though she knew his fate. All she could do
was hold his head in her lap and reluctantly look at his eyes. They were so
empty... exactly how she felt. They did not have that... shine as they used to.
His glare seemed far off, away from Tifa&#39;s loving arms. Quietly, Cloud uttered
his last words.
Cloud: &quot;Thanks a lot Tifa... if... you hadn&#39;t come... I wouldn&#39;t have...
been... distracted.&quot;
His body went limp, and Cloud&#39;s head rolled to the side. How could he say that
she thought? Imagine, his last words, an insult... The &#39;love&#39; of her life was
dead.
