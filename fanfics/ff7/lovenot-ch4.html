The golden moments in the stream of life rush past us and we see nothing 
but sand; the angels come to visit us, and we only know them when they 
are gone. George Elliot

She could feel the dress moving unhappily on her skin, soft and the 
colour of a dark night sky in the blues and indigoes she had seen as a 
child, sparkling with the stars she&#39;d made vicious promises on, stars 
she&#39;d hung her endless sorrow on and waited for the tomorrow she kept 
smiling for to take them away. Only now the dress that was the backdrop 
of her dreams whispered to her that she was going to a place far away 
with a man she knew made her skin crawl but she was doing it so one day, 
that tomorrow would come. That her tomorrow would be here sooner and 
she&#39;d no longer viciously wait on each tick and tick of the eternal 
clock, slipping time past her. Making her so old whilst she was already 
still so young.

Her dark eyes sullenly watched the ground and dirt packed together 
tightly as she swayed in the back of the Chocobo drawn carriage, her 
hair left loose and the small satchel of her work clothes left to the 
side of her, so she could change from this clinging material when the 
time was right. It was dark, as far as she could guess, the strange 
pre-dawn dark of a new day and she felt as though grit had embedded 
itself into her eyes and prickled out tears she&#39;d sworn never to allow 
to run down her cheeks ever again.

So she tightened her knuckles on the railing and bit her lip.

The gate to sector six opened and the carriage clunked through 
gracelessly, hitting a stone as it turned in ungainly fashion. Jolted, 
Tifa grabbed the railing harder as her middle was thrown into it and 
mentally said several words, forming a pretty little curse with the dark 
sentiment. Then she raised her eyes and stopped as she saw piercingly 
two figures sat atop the old slide in the children&#39;s playground that had 
fallen into misuse over the years, serving now only as a scrap haven. 
One of the figures was Cloud &#150; her heart surged suddenly with elation 
and an odd possessiveness then was dampened with a stranger new flush as 
she looked across to the girl sat next to him. She looked slender and 
almost fragile, with tanned skin and golden brown hair that was drawn as 
best the girl could likely manage away from her face, oval in shape and 
home to sparkling green eyes that stared at her in puzzlement and 
wonder. Tifa ran her hand across her middle and chest, trying to figure 
out what this new feeling was, only partially surprised to see the girl 
mimic the gesture.

But Cloud was there, dampened yellow hair and the same lost expression, 
the same distant aura surrounding him as always. She looked down 
quickly, shame blooming inside her as the carriage drew away, leaving 
behind the playground and the two figures.

Was she unhappy because she&#39;d seen Cloud with another girl?

Not particularly, she mused to herself, but more that she&#39;d believed him 
lost, that he&#39;d fallen and she&#39;d not even thought to look for him. The 
bite of her own betrayal bit deep into her heart and tears quickly 
formed in her eyes with no additional help from the gritting morning 
feeling that hung around her. She tried hard to control the tears as 
shops that filled the market rolled past. She brushed them away 
hurriedly and turned to see the sprawling mansion with the colourful 
pennants and the open doors where the man she&#39;d contacted previously 
stood; a greasy looking gentleman with a face only a mother would love, 
called Kotch.

Shakily, Tifa got out of the carriage and straightened her dress with a 
twitch of her fingers and shrug of her strong shoulders, letting it fall 
with ease into place. Then adjusting her hair, she adopted the confident 
strut and sauntered towards Kotch, &quot;The journey was terrible,&quot; she 
simpered.

&quot;Well, it was either the carriage or walking, my little beauty,&quot; he 
leered.

For a moment she thought he&#39;d place hands on her person and tensed, 
ready to break several fingers if this turned out to be the case, but it 
wasn&#39;t thankfully. Instead he gestured so she could go inside. Tifa 
followed his motion and started walking in, painfully aware they were 
all watching certain parts of her anatomy and yet also thankful they 
couldn&#39;t see the expression of disgust written across her face.

The doors behind her closed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

She moved from shop to shop like a dancing feather, asking with a sweet 
smile and tilting her head coyly to coax information from each person. 
Behind her, Cloud watched with a bemused expression, so lost that she 
stuck her tongue out between short jogging trips and laughing softly as 
he rolled his eyes in amusement back.

Once she&#39;d gathered the information she needed, Aerith came back to 
stand by the Soldier&#39;s side with a cheerful little perk of her cinnamon 
brows. &quot;This place is pretty scary,&quot; she nodded surreptitiously to the 
eager looking drunks lining the market with leers matching their already 
somewhat questionable looks, &quot;In a lot of ways. Especially for a girl. 
We&#39;ve got to find Tifa fast.&quot;

His expression looked lost and she shook her head at his next words, &quot;So 
where do we start looking.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m one step ahead of you. The little boy over there says the Honey Bee 
Inn might know some details... so we&#39;ll go there and ask, but just don&#39;t 
leave me on my own.&quot;

Cloud wrinkled a brow and brought a hand up to tap his chin, &quot;I don&#39;t 
know, you&#39;re a girl who thinks she doesn&#39;t need help from anyone.&quot;

&quot;Oh, you&#39;re terrible!&quot; she pushed him lightly and they both laughed. But 
soon she was steering him in the direction of the Inn, through the 
alleyways as per the advice and directions of several passer-bys. She 
didn&#39;t stop to ask too many questions but she did watch the kaleidoscope 
of colours and all the different shops this place had, as well as the 
various scents trickling up her nose and delighting her sense of smell.

The inn itself sat in a dingy corner of the sector, a vast growth where 
sounds of a somewhat eyebrow raising nature were coming out of. Men 
clustered around the front of the building and without thinking, she 
pressed herself in close to Cloud with wide eyes as he approached the 
doorman to try and pry some information from him about Tifa&#39;s 
whereabouts. There was the usual idle chitchat and she felt Cloud&#39;s hand 
on hers in a reassuring fashion. How shameful! To make such a fuss about 
how she could handle herself and then to be faced with this kind of 
situation. Firmly she resolved that one day she&#39;d never be this 
frightened again of such a pathetic thing, really...

Soon, he was leading her away and she was pulled into the relative light 
of the market, pushing hair from her eyes with worry. &quot;Well?&quot;

&quot;Follow me,&quot; he said and started walking. She didn&#39;t tell him he&#39;d not 
let go of her hand and neither did see any reason to &#150; after all, the 
looks seemed to be on the faces of a few thugs littering the streets on 
the way to the building Cloud was murmuring about, a mansion of some 
sorts where they were holding young girls. They passed several bars, she 
had to skip over a drunk and the insides of his stomach until she almost 
bounced off Cloud&#39;s back when he came to an unexpected stop.

Instead, she retrieved her hand, and to alleviate the disappointed look 
she smiled softly and rubbed her wrist, &quot;You gripped too hard.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry...&quot;

&quot;This is Don Corneo&#39;s Mansion.&quot; The door guard approached, looking the 
most normal Aerith had seen anyone look since they had arrived in this 
unfortunate sector. &quot;He&#39;s a big shot here in Wall Market. Listen, the 
Don&#39;s not interested in men so you just get the hell outta here, okay?&quot; 
His eyes travelled to her from Cloud and she smiled, even making the 
effort to stick a dimple in with it, &quot;Hey! You got another cute one with 
you!&quot;

She studied the mansion and turned a little so her whisper would reach 
only Cloud, &quot;Looks like this is the Mansion. I&#39;ll go take a look &#150; I&#39;ll 
tell Tifa about you.&quot; She turned away and took a few steps forward, then 
blinked as Cloud caught her arm and dragged her away with surprising 
strength. She&#39;d known he was strong but hadn&#39;t expected this kind of 
strength!

&quot;No, you can&#39;t!&quot; His expression was confused, hurt and incredibly 
frustrated all at once, suffused with that little blush over his cheeks.

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;You... do know what kind of place... this is, don&#39;t you?&quot;

She wanted to smile but instead frowned, her amusement bubbling over 
from the inside and taking the bite from her words, &quot;Then what am I 
supposed to do? Do you want to go in there with me?&quot;

He brushed a hand into his golden hair, &quot;Well.. being a man, that&#39;d be 
pretty hard... Besides, if I bust in that&#39;ll cause too much 
commotion...&quot;

She watched him and then a terrible idea struck her, accompanied with an 
image so strong that the amusement erupted inside her. She covered her 
mouth and held her stomach, laughing helplessly as the Soldier carried 
on, oblivious to her giggling fit. &quot;But I can&#39;t just let you go in 
alone... oh man... first, we need to find out if Tifa is okay...&quot; 
finally he noticed and frowned, &quot;Alright, what&#39;s so funny?&quot;

&quot;Cloud,&quot; she gasped past her giggles and reached for his hand with both 
of hers, unaware of how the light however dim made her large green eyes 
sparkle delightfully, filled with life, &quot;Why don&#39;t you dress up as a 
girl? It&#39;s the only way...&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; he jerked his hand back and stared at her in horror.

She laughed and moved to the guard, grinning so energetically that the 
guard felt compelled to smile back, &quot;Just wait, I&#39;ve got a cute friend I 
want to bring along.&quot;

&quot;Aerith,&quot; Cloud said in strangled tones from behind her, &quot;I can&#39;t...&quot;

She turned, the smile fading only a little, &quot;You are worried about Tifa 
right? Then come on, hurry!&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; He sighed as his hand was grabbed by her this time. She smiled 
to herself on the inside and began drawing him away from the mansion and 
towards the clothes shop she&#39;d seen as they&#39;d ran past it in the hurry 
to get close to the mansion. Behind her, she could hear him trying to 
formulate all manner of reasons why it wouldn&#39;t work. In her heart she 
formulated all manner of reasons on exactly why it would...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Carefully folding her clothes and shoes up with her staff, she tied them 
into a bundle and pushed it out of the cubicle ahead of her. The dress 
she&#39;d picked was red, the colour of love, passion, of vivacity. It was 
also the colour of blood.

Her eyes lidded slightly as she pulled the ribbon from the bottom of the 
braid she wore and let her hair fan out carefully. The white materia 
glinted at her from the back of her pony tail and Aerith looked at it 
mutely, wondering to herself if she would ever be able to unlock the 
secrets of the materia.

&quot;Aerith, you ready?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she called out and opened the cubicle to look across at Cloud 
who had chosen the traditional silken kimono, the blonde wig and the 
careful selection of items they&#39;d chosen to go with the outfit. She 
stepped out, feeling a little neglected because of these expeditions 
they&#39;d done in order to pretty Cloud up. But the gasps of appreciation 
from the others in the shop made her warm a little on the inside. But 
the Soldier&#39;s expression was almost thunderstruck.

&quot;Oh, you&#39;re no fun,&quot; she said a little sadly, disappointed by his verbal 
lack of affirmation. Moving to pick up her backpack, she watched Cloud 
do the same with his gear and started walking after him, waving to the 
kind shop owners who&#39;d helped them in their crazy quest for dress, items 
and wig.

She lifted the dress hem clear of the floor and stepped after Cloud, 
conscious of how cool the evening air was getting. Soon they arrived by 
the mansion front and she stepped ahead of Cloud, offering that same 
energetic smile to the guard, &quot;Hey again.&quot;

&quot;Damn, your friends hot too!&quot; The strangled if muted sound of 
indignation made her giggle and she covered her mouth, thankful the 
guard had his back turned as he fumbled with the latch to let them in, 
&quot;Come in, come in &#150; two ladies, coming through!&quot;

She stepped in without hesitation, looking back to see Cloud fight 
against grinding his teeth. Perhaps this was his punishment for his less 
than desirable reaction on seeing her in a dress like this. &quot;Hey ladies, 
I&#39;ll go let the Don know you&#39;re here, no wandering around!&quot;

They both nodded and when the man was gone, she turned to Cloud in the 
expansive foyer of the mansion with her hands on her hips and smiled, 
with grim satisfaction, the smile reminiscent of the old &#145;told you so&#39; 
chants as used by children the world over. &quot;Now&#39;s our chance, lets find 
Tifa.&quot;

They began an exhaustive search of the Mansion until they heard what 
sounded like a vague thumping noise from a room and together, braved 
down the darkly lit stairwell. To Aerith, it reminded her of walking 
into the throat of some demon, each step bringing her closer to the fate 
she knew waited for her, the heavy feeling growing in her stomach as 
shadows flickered everywhere around her.

At the bottom was what appeared to be a torture room, complete with 
rack, furnace and hooks on the wall. Dark tell-tale smears made her 
avert her eyes with a gulp and press both hands to her stomach. By the 
rack stood the girl they&#39;d seen on the carriage, complete with blue 
dress and up close, Aerith could see the wine-dark eyes that suddenly 
looked towards them. Cloud coughed in embarrassment and moved to the 
side to let Aerith past. She came down the steps and smiled to Tifa.

&quot;Tifa?&quot; she ventured first, before the other girl could get a word in 
edgewise, &quot;Nice to meet you. I&#39;m Aerith. Cloud&#39;s told me a lot about 
you.&quot; She offered her hand.

&quot;...And you are...?&quot; Tifa blinked and took the hand gently, shaking it, 
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re the one who was with Cloud in the park.&quot;

&quot;Right, with Cloud.&quot;

A strange air hung between them and then she almost felt guilty at the 
look of betrayal that white washed over Tifa&#39;s face, &quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry, we just met. It&#39;s nothing,&quot; she tried to insert 
hurriedly.

&quot;What do you mean, don&#39;t worry?&quot; Tifa looked at her again, the 
expression shifting to something slightly more wistful and sad, 
&quot;About...what? No, don&#39;t misunderstand. Cloud and I grew up together, 
nothing more.&quot;

Then why are you so sad and lonely? Why do you look through me and 
falter on your words? What is going on with this girl?

&quot;Poor Cloud,&quot; Aeris suddenly smirked and hid it behind a hand. She 
wanted to roll around laughing, in all honesty. &quot;Having to stand here 
and listen to us talk about him as if he&#39;s nothing. Right, Cloud?&quot;

&quot;Cloud?&quot; Tifa&#39;s expression was puzzled, but then at the flower girls 
gesture, she looked at the other &#145;girl&#39; who had followed the steps down 
and her eyes widened! Aerith turned away, trying so hard not to laugh as 
Tifa crossed over the space and poked at the makeup incredulously, 
&quot;Cloud? Why are you dressed like... like that? And what are you doing 
here? ...forget about that, what...&quot; there was a strange hitch in her 
voice and Aerith looked up at the pair, did Cloud not hear it? &quot;What 
happened to you after the fall? Are you hurt?&quot;

&quot;Hey, give me a chance to answer,&quot; he looked sheepish and almost brow 
beaten, if anything, &quot;I&#39;m dressed like this...&quot; his blue eyes gave her 
an accusatory look and the giggles almost bubbled over again, so she bit 
her lip, &quot;Because there was no other way to get in here. I&#39;m all right, 
Aerith helped me out.&quot;

&quot;Oh... Aerith did...&quot; Tifa&#39;s eyes travelled down to her hands, wrung 
together and once more, the flower girl frowned, trying to figure out 
what the problem was here.

&quot;Tifa... explain, why are you in a place like this?&quot;

&quot;Oh..ummm...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll just plug my ears,&quot; Aerith offered helpfully and covered both ears 
with her hands quickly, moving away to let the pair talk privately. In 
truth she was starting to feel entirely unsure about this whole 
situation.

When he&#39;d fallen into her church, she was certain that she and him were 
out to do something incredible, like change the world; the kind of 
things her real mother had spoken of. The weave of the lifestream and 
how it wound around the world, that she would be able to dip her hands 
into it and focus her energy, focus the magic and make anything possible 
because of what she is.

But now Tifa was there and a second feeling almost as strong as the 
first, perhaps stronger in some ways, told her that she and Tifa were 
also going to do something even more profound than that which she and 
Cloud would do. Only she didn&#39;t know what yet...

&quot;...Everyday he gets three girls, chooses one of them and well... and 
then... anyway, I have to be the girl or I&#39;m out for tonight.&quot;

She lowered her hands from her ears and turned around, &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she 
said softly, drawing their attention from the despairing silence Tifa&#39;s 
statement had thrown over the room, &quot;I overheard. If you know the other 
two girls, there shouldn&#39;t be a problem, right?&quot;

&quot;No, Aerith, I can&#39;t have you get involved!&quot;

She turned her bright, lively eyes onto him and narrowed them, the first 
real sign of annoyance she&#39;d properly given, &quot;Oh, so it&#39;s all right for 
Tifa to be in danger?&quot;

&quot;No...I don&#39;t want Tifa in...&quot; he tried helplessly, making expansive 
gestures, but the martial artist cut him short.

&quot;Is it all right?&quot;

&quot;I grew up in the slums, I&#39;m used to danger.&quot; ...needles...tables...hunt 
me, catch me if you can...and the ghosts come, hunger...hate...and 
forever you&#39;ll run away... &quot;Do you trust me?&quot;

Tifa drew close to her and she smiled, taking one of Tifa&#39;s arms, 
vaguely surprised that the feeling of being hit in the stomach finally 
quelled at having Tifa close to her too, as it did with Cloud, &quot;Yes, 
thanks, Ms Aerith.&quot;

&quot;Please, just call me Aerith?&quot;

The two girls smiled at each other as Cloud gawped at them in the 
background, a voice ringing out from above, &quot;HEY&quot; they all looked up to 
the stairwell top and sighed, the man from the foyer looking back down 
at them, &quot;It&#39;s time Ladies, the Don is waiting. I told you not to wander 
around... I tell ya, women nowadays... hurry up, will ya!&quot;

&quot;I er,&quot; Cloud coughed and drew their attention, his expression miserable 
and resigned, &quot;I probably don&#39;t need to ask this, but I&#39;m the other 
girl, right?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Tifa smiled, &quot;There was no need...&quot;

Aerith finished, &quot;To ask!&quot;

The both broke into laughter as they began to make their way up the 
stairs and towards the dangerous situation ahead of them...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The water was cold and smelt pretty bad.

It lapped on her cheek in small tides, pushing up against her nose as 
she sat up slowly, hearing Cloud ask Aerith the same question he&#39;d asked 
her not seconds ago. The affirming answer that she was alright, made 
Tifa sigh in relief. Her clothes however, the white shirt and mini skirt 
were covered in sludge from the sewer. Taking this time to wipe the muck 
off, she then drew on her gloves that she didn&#39;t have time to pull on 
before, hurried in the rush to save Cloud from Corneo.

Speaking of that, she wasn&#39;t sure how she felt about a man being deemed 
more attractive than she, when dressed up as a woman. Aerith, she could 
understand; the flower girl was genuinely beautiful, with a sweet smile 
and eyes that just sparkled with whatever little light was in the area.

Tifa got to her feet, eyes drawn to the lively yet fragile woman who 
stood with the aid of her staff, from around the side of the monster 
they&#39;d defeated. She&#39;d never met a magic master before, she knew they 
existed. After all, Materia shop owners all owned the basic precepts of 
using materia, but she&#39;d never before seen anyone draw the hidden 
strengths of one of those crystalline orbs out with such ease. And the 
strange power she used as a refreshing wind in battle...

She hitched her shoulder and worked at the muscle, feeling it give 
slightly and sighing, the dent in the pipe close by testament to the 
crunching blow she&#39;d taken from the monster that had left her dazed and 
facedown in the sewer water, trying to count the stars that whirled in 
her head.

Looking down she was aware both of them were looking at her, staring 
infact as she gripped her hands into fists, trying to mentally latch 
onto something. The old, ice cold grief was rushing up, the burning 
sensation hard in her heart, &quot;It&#39;s too late,&quot; she tried to say, choking 
on the words. &quot;Marlene... Barrett... the people in the slums...&quot;

A cool hand touched her upper arm and before she could think, Tifa 
recoiled to stare the couple of inches down into Aerith&#39;s bright green 
eyes, filled with comfort. &quot;Don&#39;t give up,&quot; she said softly, &quot;Don&#39;t ever 
give up hope. It&#39;s not easy to destroy the pillar, right?&quot;

Tifa stared and then gripped her hand over the delicate one on her arm 
and looked to Cloud &#150; where had he been blessed enough to find this 
unrelenting soul, filled with such hope? &quot;Yeah... you&#39;re right! We still 
have time.&quot;

Cloud nodded back to her and together they set off through the sewers. 
At one point, Aerith stopped them and began to dig through some garbage. 
The soldier almost said something, but paused when the girl straightened 
up with a shining materia balanced on the flat of her palm, a radiant 
smile on her face. &quot;People throw away even the most useful of things,&quot; 
she explained softly, slotting it into Tifa&#39;s armour. It made sense, 
Tifa wasn&#39;t exactly bad with materia, but the yellow glow of a command 
materia was better suited to her nature.

&quot;What type is it?&quot; she asked as they walked towards the ladder leading 
upwards.

&quot;A sense materia I think.&quot;

&quot;Well, what does that do?&quot;

&quot;When you&#39;re in a fight and say the enemy seems to be slightly stronger 
than you anticipated, right?&quot; Aerith smiled up at her between steps, 
accepting the help from Tifa to get over a pipe that blocked their way 
to the ladder which everyone could see by now, &quot;So you&#39;d want to know 
their weaknesses and exploit them, even perhaps know how tired they were 
getting. A sense materia helps you to do that. Just cast the magic 
through the orb and it&#39;ll tell you all about the enemy and will continue 
to do so until they&#39;re defeated, either by a knock out or well... you 
know.&quot;

&quot;I gotcha,&quot; Tifa said.

&quot;There&#39;s a ladder here,&quot; Cloud said quietly and together they slogged 
over to it. Without a second word, he went on up ahead and Tifa placed 
the flats of her hands together with frustration.

&quot;He always does this, he doesn&#39;t think of anyone else sometimes,&quot; she 
grumbled.

Aerith couldn&#39;t help but laugh, much to the martial artists surprise, 
&quot;But, at least this way he won&#39;t be looking up our skirts, I think he 
was thinking about that.&quot;

I never thought of that... how much of a tomboy have I become?

&quot;I ah... I guess so.&quot; Tifa laughed along with Aerith and stepped aside, 
&quot;After you. I&#39;ll be under you so if you fall, I&#39;ll catch you.&quot;

&quot;I know you will.&quot;

They locked eyes for a moment, then the flower girl was shinnying up the 
ladder with slow movements, not as physically robust as the rest of 
them. Tifa risked a glance upwards at the slender legs that moved slowly 
between rungs and sighed, holding her arms out as if ready to catch her. 
But quickly enough the girl was gone up the ladder and out of the 
manhole.

Tifa lowered her hands and took a hold of the ladder, starting her own 
climb without a backwards look, bathed in the vague glow of materia on 
the slot in her bangle. The girl was a mystery to Tifa. At times she 
felt like she should hold her and run far away, so the world couldn&#39;t 
harm something so precious... and other times she wanted to keep her 
there forever, so she wouldn&#39;t feel so rejected.

Her hands gripped the tarmac beyond the opening and she began to haul 
herself out, blinking as the cool hands of Aerith tried to assist, 
however clumsily the attempt was. The simple gesture brought a smile to 
her face and she looked up and winked, as she crawled out.

&quot;Aerith, I got you mixed up in all of this...&quot; Cloud started, again.

Tifa felt like knocking some sense into him, preferably with one of the 
old derelict trains left lying around. She recognised where they were 
and took a quick look around as her new friend berated him in soft, 
deceptive tones.

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me to go home.&quot;

She smiled and lowered her hand, glancing back at them. &quot;Let&#39;s see... if 
we get past the trains that are lit up, we should be able to get out of 
here,&quot; she pointed northward. &quot;That way.&quot;

&quot;...&quot; Cloud wrenched his blue eyes away from Aerith and then fixed Tifa 
with a faintly accusing look, as if she weren&#39;t helping the situation, 
then he started towards the trains with a grumpy sound.

Tifa took Aerith&#39;s arm, to her own surprise and murmured, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, 
he&#39;s just a little upset because things aren&#39;t going his way.&quot;

&quot;Poor Cloud,&quot; Aerith sighed.

But she didn&#39;t take her arm back either...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

There was gunfire everywhere and she was forced to cover her ears at the 
loud barrage. Behind her, Aerith crouched over the body of the fallen 
Wedge, his round body broken from the massive fall.

Tears stood, shockingly, in those green eyes. Tifa wondered how she 
could cry for a man she didn&#39;t even know, for a life she had never been 
a part of. The compassion in the hands as they gently felt the broken 
ribs and the bit lip where blood was drawn to rosy under the skin.

She wished she&#39;d never see the girl weep again.

It was all their doing. ShinRa.

Tifa clenched her hands, glaring at the ground as Cloud went to help 
open up the gate to let them through onto the pillar. But she didn&#39;t 
hear him, staring until the floor should immolate.

&quot;I&#39;m going up! Aerith, you take care of Wedge.&quot; Without a second look, 
Cloud ran up the pillar base.

Tifa hung on, moving to crouch by Aerith who was weeping silently even 
as her hands went through the useless motions. The hardened girl had 
seen enough death to know that the glassy eyes and the lifeless sprawl 
indicated Wedge was gone, that nothing Aerith did now could ever matter.

&quot;Aerith,&quot; she said softly, taking one of the hands and rubbing the back 
of it gently, &quot;I have a favour to ask. I have a bar called &#145;Seventh 
Heaven&#39; in this neighbourhood. There&#39;s a little girl there, called 
Marlene.&quot;
