<h1>Love, Lust, and...TENTICLES?!</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bluemoon.html">Blue Moon</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Hello again all! This is your friendly but really wierd author Blue 
Moon. (AKA Sir Lynxis Bleu Moon) In case you guessed, I&#39;m the same guy 
that wrote A Frozen Flower Warmed by the Planet. Anyway, I&#39;m here to 
bring you my second Lemon. I got a fairly positive response from my 
first one so I decided to write a second one. If all goes well, I&#39;ll 
keep writting more and more. (NOO AHH!) Anyway, This one is gonna be a 
little different than my previous one. My previous one was ment to be 
a romantic story more than anything. Just had a lemon scene at the end 
that&#39;s all. Anyway, as you may be able to tell from the title, this is 
a Henticle. It involves a monster with tenticles going around and 
raping people with them. (Just girls)  Also, I&#39;m doing this only for 
the enjoyment of others and myself and for my own personal educational 
purposes. I&#39;m just experimenting a bit here. Anyway, on with it cuz 
this intro was long enough on its own!

***

Cloud and Tifa were opening thier eyes after the bright flash of Holy 
desicrating Meteor. To thier surprise, no one else was left on the 
Highwind. However, before they had a chance to wonder about it, a 
white figure materialized infront of them. It was obviously a man, who 
had long silver hair and wore black pants, an incredible long sword 
held in his right hand.

&quot;Sephiroth!!&quot; Cloud screamed and in a flash, the Ultimate weapon was 
drawn and Cloud slashed a lightning fast blow at Sephiroth. After 
realizing that Sephiroth was still standing and actually laughing at 
him. At a slightly closer look, Cloud noticed that Sephiroth was 
transparent. He decided to wait because it seemed that Sephiroth had 
something to say.

&quot;Hahaha! Failure. The failure who actually beat me. But who has the 
last laugh? Why me of coarse! But that doesn&#39;t matter. My time is very 
limited, but my power isn&#39;t. I&#39;ll use all of my power to summon a new 
monster, made up of all of the souls in the lifestream. Hahahaha...&quot; 
Sephiroth slowly rose his arms to the air and summoned all his 
strength to create this monster. Soon, Sephiroth starts vanishing from 
sight but then it seems as though time goes still for Tifa.

She watches as Cloud&#39;s anger is fueling his power. Then after a 
moment, he lets loose..however, not with Omni-Slash as usual. He holds 
his sword into the air above his head and soon energy is visibly being 
sucked from the earth below them, into his sword and then into him. 
After but a few seconds, the energy sucking has stopped. Cloud and his 
sword are glowing bright green. At first, Tifa didn&#39;t understand what 
Cloud did but it quickly dawned on her. He sucked up all of the mako 
around him and is using himself as a multiplier. This meant that 
wherever the energy ends up going, so does he. Another thing upon 
looking at Sephiroth, is that he is going into the lifestream.

Cloud lowered his sword and pointed it at Sephiroth. Then Cloud yelled 
&quot;MAKO DELTA MULTIPLIER BEAM!!&quot; and then a huge yellow beam shot out of 
Cloud&#39;s sword and hit Sephiroth square in the chest. Sephiroth yelled 
and then there was a blinding flash of light as everything that was 
happening was going into chaos..Tifa didn&#39;t know when, where or what 
happened to make her pass out but surely enough, she did.

***

A few hours passed and Tifa woke up. As much as at this point in time, 
she really wished she didn&#39;t. The pain was overwhelming. She was sure 
that she had broken every bone in her body. However, with a little 
effort, she opened her eyes and found that she was in the wreckage of 
the Highwind. While she had passed out, it must have crashed.

After a few minutes of just waiting for some of the pain to subside, 
Tifa slowly and extreamly painfully pulled herself out of the wreckage 
that was covering her. She was lucky not to be buried under all of it 
and to be even alive..much less with few to no broken bones. She 
rolled over and found herself on some grass. Tifa decided to pay a 
little attention to where the pain was mainly coming from. She found 
that her wrists and elbows showed a great amount of pain. Her knees 
were very sore and so was her butt.

&#39;This is just great&#39; Tifa thought, &#39;I&#39;m lying on my back, in a rather 
great deal of pain..&#39; she checked herself for her weapons and found 
that they were missing as well. &#39;and I have no Restore materia to heal 
myself with. Just abso-fucking-lutly great!&#39; Then in her anger, she 
said it out loud. &quot;Just abso-fucking-lutly great!&quot; Her anger got worse 
and then she yelled it at the top of her lungs. &quot;THIS IS JUST 
ABSO-FUCKING-LUTLY GREAT!!!&quot; It was actually quite rare for her to 
swear but this is a special occasion in her mind.

&quot;Do you mind not yelling? Lord only knows what type of monsters that 
you could bring here! 1 Death is more than enough for me. I don&#39;t need 
it again.&quot;

Tifa&#39;s ears perked at the voice. It was a female voice. One that she 
never expected to hear ever again. &quot;Aeris?&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot; The voice returned.

&quot;Aeris!&quot; Tifa said again.

&quot;What?&quot; Aeris was getting a little annoyed.

&quot;You-You&#39;re alive?!&quot;

&quot;Barely. That crash couldn&#39;t have done anything nice to my life span.&quot;

&quot;Gee. You sound pretty bitchy compared to normal.&quot; Tifa observed.

&quot;If you were buried under a pile of debris, I think you would sound a 
little bitchier than normal too.&quot; Aeris obviously wasn&#39;t too pleased 
about her current situation either.

As much as Tifa&#39;s body didn&#39;t want to, she hauled herself to her feet 
and looked at the wreckage of the Highwind. Looking around, she found 
a reddish-brown lock of hair sticking up out of some of the debris. It 
was obviously Aeris&#39; hair matted with blood.

Tifa climbed over the wood and metal that was the Highwind over to 
where the hair was sticking up. She knelt down and grabbed at the 
board that was on top and removed it. Then she met with another, much 
larger piece of steel. With a lot of difficulty (and not to mention 
pain) she removed it. Looking down into the hole that was left. Tifa 
saw Aeris looking up at her with blood running down her face. Tifa 
looked at the rest of Aeris and found that there was still a large 
metal plate over her legs. Tifa reached down and lifted at them and 
then heard Aeris hiss in pain. Using all of her strength, she flipped 
the metal over releasing Aeris&#39;s legs.

Tifa quickly looked over Aeris while Aeris just looked into Tifa&#39;s 
eyes. Aeris&#39;s clothes were all ripped and torn..leaving little to the 
imagination. Aeris just looked up at her. Staring into her eyes with 
an intensity that she never seen before. It had a strange effect on 
Tifa too. Tifa immediatly felt extreamly self-conscious.

Clearing her throat, Tifa stood up and looked around. By looking 
around, she figured that they wern&#39;t too far from Choco Billy&#39;s farm. 
With a little more inspection, she guessed it was around midday. When 
most people were eating thier 2nd meal out of the 3 that were usually 
eaten.

Tifa looked back at Aeris and noticed that her legs were in no 
condition for travel. Biting her lip a little, Tifa bent down and 
picked Aeris up in her arms. Then Tifa turned around and headed for 
the Chocobo farm. After a minute of walking, Aeris rested her head on 
Tifa&#39;s shoulder and quickly dozed off to sleep, feeling completly 
protected in Tifa&#39;s arms.

Tifa found that she was very lucky that Aeris was fairly light. She 
was very sore herself, and the extra weight didn&#39;t help any but she 
coped with it. They had to get help and Choco Billy&#39;s farm was the 
closest help they could get.

A few thoughts floated into Tifa&#39;s head while she walked towards the 
farm. She know that Cloud was done and gone for. But what about that 
monster that Sephiroth spoke of? What was Aeris doing here anyway? She 
was there when Sephiroth ran her through. She seen it with her own 
eyes.

The whole thing ran through her mind over and over again. Like a play 
almost. Cloud motioned for Tifa and Barret to stay where they were 
while he jumped on the pillars to the altar where Aeris was praying. 
Tifa noticed that he looked troubled once he was at the altar. Then he 
drew out his sword. He raised it over his head and then Tifa and 
Barret both yelled at him to stop. They were lucky because he stopped 
while the blade was but a few inches from her head. Cloud quickly 
stepped back shaking his head. &quot;What are you trying to make me do!?&quot; 
Then it happened. Aeris finally looked up with an oddly triumphant 
look on her face. Then Sephiroth fell from the sky. Like a black angel 
of doom descending upon it&#39;s next victim. His sword aimed menacingly 
towards her back. As slow as it seemed, it took no time at all for the 
sword to slide through her back and out her stomach...

Then she stopped thinking completely about that for a moment. She 
looked down at the woman who was sleeping in her arms. She noticed 
that she was actually very attractive. Although you never really 
thought about it, her breasts were fairly large. The blood on her face 
was all dried up now. Then she looked into the sky and it was already 
sunset. She guessed that it was about 7:00 in the afternoon. Looking 
forward, the Chocobo farm was in sight. About 10 more minutes and 
they&#39;d be there.

Then something else caught Tifa&#39;s attention. Aeris stirred a bit in 
her sleep and mumbled something Tifa couldn&#39;t understand. Aeris&#39; face 
became contorted in some sort of pain..or fear or something. After a 
moment, Aeris started shivering. It wasn&#39;t cold out so Tifa guessed 
that Aeris was having a nightmare. Then Aeris&#39; eyes opened and she 
screamed out in fear, &quot;TIFA!&quot; she blinked twice and realized where she 
was. Still in the protection of Tifa&#39;s arms. Then Aeris put her head 
on Tifa&#39;s chest, sobed quietly and hugged her like she was afraid Tifa 
would just dissapear out of thin air.

&quot;Oh god Tifa! It was horrible! Oh god.&quot; Aeris started saying and 
hugging Tifa even harder.

Tifa just murmured things like: &quot;It&#39;s ok&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m right here.&quot; Tifa 
was glad that Aeris was hugging her now because her arms were 
extreamly sore and it allowed her to take some of the weight off of 
them because right now, it felt like Aeris weighted a ton and her back 
felt like it was about to snap like a twig. She was very glad for all 
of the training Master Zangan had put her though.

However, after the longest 10 minutes of her life, Tifa arrived at the 
farm. She found that she had to use her head to knock on the front 
door as her hands were full. Choco Billy answered the door and fainted 
when he saw the condition of the 2 women. However, his falling body 
alerted the attention of Choco Bob to the front door.

&quot;What the hell happened to you?&quot; he asked, astonished that either girl 
was even alive much less one of them carrying the other. He quickly 
thought better of it and immediatly led them inside.

Tifa thought that getting cleaned up should be the first order of 
business. &quot;May we use your bathroom?&quot; she asked.

&quot;By all means! Here, I&#39;ll take her up for you.&quot; Bob offered.

&quot;No. Don&#39;t worry about it. Just tell me where it is. I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; 
Tifa said.

&quot;It&#39;s up the stairs and down the hall..the door is open so you 
shouldn&#39;t miss it.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; asked Choco Bob&#39;s wife as she walked into the room. 
Then her jaw dropped when she saw the two girls. &quot;My god! What in 
heavens name happened?&quot;

&quot;A little Highwind mishap is all.&quot; Tifa answered. &quot;I just want to get 
cleaned up, have some rest and we&#39;ll be on our way.&quot;

&quot;By all means..I think the worlds saviors and best chocobo breeders in 
the world deserve at least that. I&#39;ll bring some clothes up in a 
moment for you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you so much!&quot; Tifa said sincerely and went up the stairs still 
holding the weeping Aeris in her arms. Tifa found the bathroom without 
much trouble. She closed the door and turned on the water and adjusted 
the knobs so that the water&#39;s heat was to her liking.

While waiting for the water in the bathtub to fill up, Tifa helped 
Aeris remove her tattered clothing and by the time it was all off, the 
tub was almost full. Tifa turned off the water and helped Aeris into 
it. Slowly, with help from Tifa, Aeris submerged herself into the 
water. Her crying had stopped by now.

Once Tifa was satisfied that Aeris was going to be fine on her own, 
Tifa got up to leave and give her friend some privacy but as she 
reached the door knob, Aeris said, &quot;Please don&#39;t go Tifa.&quot; It was more 
like a plea. Tifa stopped dead in her tracks and turned around to look 
at her friend. &quot;Tifa. I have to talk to you about a few things.&quot; Tifa 
decided to sit down on the toilet. (Just a little tidbit of info from 
the author: The guy that invented the toilet&#39;s name was John 
Crapper..now if you&#39;ve ever wondered why it was called a john or a 
crapper, you know!) &quot;The first thing is Cloud. I won&#39;t impede on you 
and him anymore. You are free to be with each other.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t bother. He&#39;s gone. They all are. Sephiroth sucked them into the 
Lifestream. I don&#39;t think I even loved him that much. I haven&#39;t shed a 
tear for him yet and I don&#39;t feel as though that tear will be coming 
for a long time to say the least.&quot;

Aeris was taken aback, &quot;Cloud&#39;s...gone? They all are?&quot;

&quot;Yes Aeris. You and me are all that&#39;s left. Sephiroth took them all.&quot;

&quot;How come I didn&#39;t see them in the Lifestream?&quot;

&quot;Because they went there at about the same time you came here. Cloud 
attacked Sephiroth with an odd attack and everything went weird. 
Sephiroth was supposed to unleash a huge, deadly monster upon us..it&#39;s 
power would dwarf that of the weapons..but how come we haven&#39;t seen it 
yet is what I&#39;m wondering...&quot;

Oddly enough, all of her questions were gonna be answered in a few 
minutes as the sounds of a struggle were heard by Tifa and Aeris. 
Before they had time to react however, everything was quiet as soon as 
it had started.

Then creaking could be heard by the end of the hall where the stairs 
were. It was either the monster or a member of the Choco family. The 
creaking stopped and after a moment, the door was smashed to bits.

&quot;OH SHIT!&quot; was all Tifa had time to say before a slimy tenticle had 
wrapped itself around Tifa&#39;s mouth quickly silencing her. Aeris just 
looked on in wide eyed terror at the creature. It&#39;s skin was sea blue, 
and it had tenticles coming out from its sides and back. It had 2 arms 
that didn&#39;t exactly look big or anything but they did have muscles. 
The shoulders were the same as well as the stomache. Actually, it 
looked human for the most part except that it was far taller. Upon a 
slighly closer inspection, the figure had...breasts? Actually, the 
only thing that made them difficult to see was because there were many 
tenticles obscuring her view of that particular part of the body. 
Looking a little lower, on the body, Aeris noticed a shaved mound. 
&#39;IT&#39; was a she! Hair was none existant all over the body..this could 
be told because she was naked. Not like she&#39;d be able to wear anything 
anyway. Female or not, this was still obviously a monster.

Aeris noticed all of this in a second..and a second was all it took 
for the monster to wrap a tenticle around Aeris&#39; midsection and lift 
her out of the water with ease. Looking over at Tifa, Aeris saw that 
Tifa was in a similar predicament except that she also had a tenticle 
around mouth, effectivly silencing her..Looking back at it, she saw an 
evil grin on the monsters face. as a tenticle wrapped itself around 
Aeris&#39; own mouth.

&quot;Well well well.&quot; the creature said. &quot;Funny I should see you two 
again. Well, at least I don&#39;t have to deal with that blond 
cross-dresser this time. So...who am I gonna choose? The excited one?&quot; 
her face turned to Tifa who was kicking and thrashing about trying to 
get loose from the tenticles but they held Tifa without much visible 
difficulty. &quot;Or.&quot; Her face landed back on Aeris. &quot;the less dressed 
one? Decisions decisions...I think I will pick YOU to start&quot; She said 
as she raised one of her hands and pointed at Aeris. &quot;It only seems 
logical because you are already naked and all...&#39;wet&#39;.&quot; Tifa&#39;s eyes 
went wide with realization and she struggled even harder against the 
tenticles..

&quot;muhh..mpphh!uhhm muhn! (Oh my god! Your Don Cornello!)&quot; Tifa 
&#39;mmmff&#39;ed.

&quot;Yes yes! I love my new body. Now, instead of giving pleasure to just 
one girl..I can give it to many!&quot;

&quot;mffmff mff mf mmmm! (You were never happy you leach!&quot; Tifa 
&#39;umhmmmff&#39;ed

&quot;hahaha! Now I live again but this time..to please!&quot;

Don..or in the case of gender,..Donna found that she had to use a few 
more tenticles to keep Tifa still. More tenticles wrapped around 
Tifa&#39;s wrists and ankles to keep her still.

&quot;Now. I&#39;m hungry and it&#39;s time to get to business.&quot;

Aeris&#39; eyes went wide open as she relized was Donna meant. Basically, 
she was gonna get raped. Although Aeris didn&#39;t notice..she was already 
getting excited. Aeris chose this time to start thrashing like crazy 
against the tenticles but it made no difference.

Quickly, tenticles wrapped around her wrists and ankels and she was 
suspended in the air by thier strength. And she seemed light in thier 
grasp. Quickly, a tenticle wrapped around her left tit and squeezed 
gently, not wanting to leave bruises or marks. Aeris&#39; breathing grew 
faster now as her tit was messaged but she tried to fight the pleasure 
that this was giving her, gritting her teeth in effort.

Tifa couldn&#39;t do anything but watch her friend get molested by Donna 
the tenticle woman. Unknowingly becoming slightly aroused simply by 
seeing Aeris getting raped.

Aeris on the other hand was not too happy with her current predicament 
and was screaming like there was no tomorrow. She was silenced however 
when a tenticle filled her mouth, forcing her into giving it a sort of 
blowjob. Yet another tenticle had appeared and started doing what the 
one on her left breast was doing to it, to the right one. Squeezing 
and messaging it. After less than a minute, her nipples were 
practically rocks, begging for attention. And attention they got. 
Instead of just messaging the breasts now, the tenticles rubbed over 
the nipples. Aeris was in a state of shock right now and all that she 
did was shake her head from side to side slightly, her mouth moving in 
unspoken words. A particularly strong squeeze of her tits brought her 
back to earth.

Although it was happening, Aeris still didn&#39;t believe what was 
happening. It wasn&#39;t that she was being molested by tenticles that she 
didn&#39;t believe, it was that her body was responding to what they were 
doing.

Rolling her head back, Aeris let out a little muffled groan of 
pleasure. She was admitly defeated, so to speak. she only thought one 
thing after her defeat. &#39;Goddamn traitorous body of mine,..give it an 
inch and it takes a mile...&#39;

The pleasure was starting to blank out Aeris&#39; mind and all that was 
around her. All that existed anymore were the tenticles that were 
ravishing her body and the pleasure that they brought on but they 
weren&#39;t enough, and she felt like she would go insane if something 
wasn&#39;t done about a certain burning in her crotch and belly. Almost as 
if on request, she felt a tenticle rubbing itself along her upper, 
inner thighs. It didn&#39;t stay there long however and quickly started to 
play on her outer lips. Running up and down them quickly. This didn&#39;t 
last either , and the tenticle quickly slid deeply into her.

Everything went sharply into focus for a fraction of a second as it 
entered her. The sweat covering her body. Her chestnut brown hair 
plastered to her face because of the water and sweat. The smooth, 
slightly slimy texture of the tenticles holding her and fucking her. 
Her own musky scent filling the air, she could even smell someone 
elses. Tifa. It came to her instantly but she wasn&#39;t surprised,..Tifa 
was getting off on watching her getting raped. More or less. It wasn&#39;t 
rape if it was willing and right now, she&#39;d have to say that she&#39;s 
fairly willing.

Then the fraction of a second was over, and another fraction of a 
second and the large tenticle that was filling her, started to move in 
and out at a fairly slow pace. It stayed this way for a moment and 
then a noticeably smaller tenticle started to massage her ass. But the 
tenticles on her tits were still doing their magic and were all but 
forgotten. She was in the promised land right now. To hell with 
waiting to die.

The tenticle in Aeris&#39;s mouth had removed itself and slithered down 
her body leaving a wet trail It got to her stomach and slid around her 
side to join the one at her ass. This one went straight to her anus 
however and rubbed all over it, even dipping in slightly. Now 
normally, Aeris would have shivered at the sensation but her whole 
body was on pleasureable fire. Soon, that tenticle withdrew as well as 
the one that was currently in her. She couldn&#39;t believe how 
frustrating this was! But after a moment, the tenticle that was at her 
ass, lubricating it replaced the the one that withdrew from her pussy. 
It was of the same size so she didn&#39;t have any quarrels really.

A new sensation ripped through her as the smaller tenticle entered her 
anus and starting pushing in and out of it. This new sensation was 
most certainly welcome as well. Aeris could have swore that she had 
died and went to the promised land. Letting her head roll back, she 
closed her eyes and her moaning and crying out in pleasure didn&#39;t 
cease for a second. She also started to wonder a bit on what happened 
to the tenticle that seemingly abandoned her but it wasn&#39;t missed. The 
others made up for it.

Tifa couldn&#39;t get enough of the taste. Still bound by the tenticles, 
Donna took the tenticle that was screwing Aeris and offered it to Tifa 
who was currently sucking on it with reckless abandon. Tifa continued 
to watched Aeris get her brains fucked out, for lack of a better verb. 
Her breasts were swollen and demanded some attention but she&#39;d have to 
wait. Her panties were soaked through and if the tenticles would let 
go, shed be masturbating sooner than.....well.. there is nothing to 
compare it to but it would be fast..thats for sure. For now, she&#39;d 
just have to live with sucking on a tenticle flavored with Aeris&#39; 
juices...

Aeris, who was swinging in the air by the force of the tenticles 
rushing in and out of her, felt the first wave of her orgasm hit 
her...Now she was begging for it.

&quot;Oh god! Oh yyeesss! Faster! Faster! OHHHH!&quot; When she felt that she 
was right on the edge of her orgasm, all of the tenticles 
stopped..letting her just stay there for a moment. She almost 
whimpered in dissapointment. Then, like a violent shove over the edge, 
all of the tenticles suddenly started to move and very fast. Ok, I was 
wrong, it wasn&#39;t like a violent shove, it was more like grabbing her 
and throwing her over the edge like she weighted little or nothing.

&quot;AAAHHHHH!!!&quot; She just screamed and screamed out in release. Her whole 
body bucking and thrashing wildly in the throes of orgasm. Tifa 
herself almost creamed just at the sight and sounds of 
it...almost..she truly wished she did though..

But all good things do eventually come to an end. (damnit, bad 
pun..&#39;COME&#39; to an end..hehe) And come Aeris did. It almost flowed out 
from her but for sure, some of it did end up on the floor and all over 
the now sticky with cum tenticle. Eventually, however, the orgasm died 
down and Aeris was spent. She had been practially knocked out by the 
force of her orgasm.

Donna carefully lowered Aeris to the floor, then retracted all of her 
tenticles from her body. &quot;Now, I&#39;m gonna be quick with you. I have 
engagements to attend.&quot; Donna said, looking over to Tifa. Tifa just 
smiled happily. She was finally gonna get the release she so wanted, 
needed even.

All of the taste from the one tenticle was gone now and it was 
switched with the one that had been stuck in Aeris&#39;s pussy. With a 
renewed vigor, Tifa sucked on that tenticle. This one tasted better 
than the last one too. Another tenticle ripped Tifa&#39;s clothes off in 
one quick swipe. Now she was as naked as the sleeping beauty on the 
floor not too far away.

Deciding not to be as gentle with Tifa and to totally skip any sort of 
foreplay, Tifa was hoisted into the air and a similar manner as what 
had happened to Aeris. Tenticles went straight for Tifa&#39;s large tits 
and started to rub and message them immediatly, eliciting moans from 
the girl.

Donna didn&#39;t leave this like this for long however. A rather small 
tenticle quickly penetrated her, making her gasp in both suprise and 
pleasure. Then the tenticle started to pump in and out for a minute 
and then it withdrew to be replaced by a much larger one which 
immediatly started humping her. Tifa decided that she liked this a 
lot. A hell of a lot. The pleasure steadily grew as the tenticles were 
picking up in pace. Then the smaller tenticle that was going at Tifa 
but a few moments before went straight up her ass. Literally. It 
started to pump in and out at a leisurely pace. Tifa decided that she 
didn&#39;t really mind having it there but she would have gotten along 
fine without it too. The sensations were odd but not all that 
pleasurable as opposed to Aeris who just seemed to love getting it up 
her butt.

Tifa was being filled deeper than any man ever could unless he had a 
12 incher but it was most unlikely that she would ever meet a man with 
12 inches of meat. But either way, she was really enjoying herself 
right now.

But all thought of that escaped her mind as the probing and massaging 
tenticles brought on the first throes of a quickly building orgasm. It 
didn&#39;t take long before she was screaming out in pure extascy.

&quot;ohshitohshitohshitohshit! OH GOD SSSSHHHHIIIIIAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!&quot; 
The usual tidal wave wasn&#39;t there this time. It was a huge fucking 
TSUNAMI! Thousands of blazing fireworks flashed though Tifa&#39;s mind in 
the space of a few seconds. Her whole body, locking up, bucking at the 
hips, then shaking completly, locking up, bucking, etc, etc, etc. over 
and over. After almost a full minute, the spasms stopped and Tifa was 
still. Her sweat covered chest raising and falling in a rythmic 
manner.

&quot;Wow.&quot; was all Tifa said before falling into a light sleep, still 
suspended by the tenticles. Just as carefully as with Aeris, Donna 
lowered Tifa onto the ground and withdrew all of her tenticles from 
her body as well.

The tenticles slowly slithered into Donna&#39;s back and sides and 
dissapeared from view. Looking more like a regular person now. Just a 
different color.

&quot;There you go mistress Venus. I&#39;ve held my part of the bargain, now 
you hold yours!&quot; Donna said to the air more or less. A smile crossed 
her face just before she dissapeared in a bright yellow flash of 
light.

*****************
A few hours later
*****************

Tifa awoke to a slightly tingly sensation all over her body. It was a 
pleasent afterglow tingle. Still, it all felt like a dream. The whole 
days events. Everything from Sephiroth appearing and trying to summon 
a big monster to destroy everything to being screwed brainless by a 
few tenticles. But a slight sore in her crotch and ass said a 
different story. The fact that she was naked and all covered in sweat 
and lying in a pool of her own juices told the same story as the sore.

Looking over the room, Aeris was still passed out on the floor. 
Looking at herself again, Tifa noticed that she was very dirty and 
looking again at Aeris, she decided that she wasn&#39;t done with her bath 
either.

Groggily pulling herself to her feet, Tifa stumbled over the room to 
the bathtub and upon quick inspection, she decided that the water 
needed to be drained and that the tub was large enough for the two of 
them if they squeezed together a bit. Something Tifa had every intent 
on doing anyways. Tifa reached into the cold water and pulled the plug 
to drain the water.

Then the tears finally came. Cloud had sacrificed himself trying to 
stop Sephiroth&#39;s last ditch effort to destroy the world. Yeah, Tifa 
loved Cloud. There was no doubt about it. The strongest man that she 
had ever known. In both mind and body. But being a clone of Sephiroth, 
he was of the same strength and power and so it took all of it to 
finally defeat him.

&quot;But why the hell did he have to die!?&quot;

&quot;Tifa..&quot; Aeris had finally woken up. Tifa just hugged her friend 
tightly. Aeris was all Tifa had left from the whole ordeal and she 
wasn&#39;t even really supposed to be there. Tifa held on to Aeris like 
she was going to dissapear too. &quot;It&#39;s allright Tifa. Let it all out.&quot; 
Aeris hugged her back and was slowly stroking Tifa&#39;s hair.

&quot;You&#39;re all I have left.&quot; Tifa sobbed. Her whole body tremoring in her 
sobbing.

&quot;No. You&#39;re wrong. Goddess Venus seen to it that we aren&#39;t. Everyone 
is back home doing whatever it was they were going to do after Meteor 
was destroyed. Everybody except,...Cloud.&quot; Upon hearing the name, Tifa 
sobbed even harder. Aeris realized that after being screwed beyond 
belief by the tenticle monster, the emotional barriers that Tifa had 
put up had finally crumbled.

Tifa just sobbed like that for quite some time. Although she somehow 
knew that Aeris was right about all their other friends being fine, 
she still felt all alone with only Aeris left.

Eventually Tifa had stopped and Aeris asked if she was alright. Tifa 
nodded and said, &quot;I guess you never got your bath and besides, your a 
mess!&quot; Aeris inspected herself a little and agreed. By now, the water 
had long since been completely drained and Tifa turned on the water 
again.

Aeris stood up and holding Tifa&#39;s hand, she stepped into the filling 
tub and sat down in the hot water. Aeris started shifting around a bit 
experimentally. Then she said, &quot;You know Tifa, I think that if we 
squish together, there&#39;ll be enough room for the both of us.&quot; Aeris 
tried to make it sound more like an observation but it came out more 
like an invitation. Tifa who seemed to be slightly started from her 
thoughts, blushed a bit and when looking up at Aeris, noticed that she 
was blushing a bit as well. Tifa didn&#39;t hesitate long however, and 
quickly jumped into the tub behind Aeris. Aeris relaxed a bit and 
after a moment, found that she&#39;d have to turn off the water or it 
would start to overflow. Leaning forward, she turned the tap and the 
water stopped flowing.

Slowly, Aeris leaned back again and just relaxed, enjoying the feeling 
of Tifa&#39;s large breasts pressing into her back. Letting her neck go 
lax, Aeris&#39;s head was resting on Tifa&#39;s shoulder. Tifa looked at 
Aeris, who&#39;s eyes were closed lightly and had a content look on her 
face. Tifa&#39;s eyes came to rest on Aeris&#39; lips. Almost in a trance, 
Tifa brought her head down and pressed her lips against Aeris&#39;. Not 
doing anything, just the contact of lips. Aeris&#39; eyes opened wide but 
slowly closed and brought her arm around Tifa&#39;s head and and started 
to kiss back. Aeris also noted that her own taste still lingered on 
Tifa&#39;s lips but only slightly.

Tifa responded to the kiss as well and gradually, the kiss deepened. 
Tongues entwining and dancing together in a waltz of passion. The 
electricity of the kiss only heightened the experience for both of 
them.

After a few minutes of just this, Tifa&#39;s hand started to explore 
Aeris&#39; body a bit. Her left hand cupped Aeris&#39; cheek lovingly. Tifa 
felt her blush spread across her upper chest but was really too 
preoccupied to notice it too much. Tifa&#39;s left hand rubbed up and down 
Aeris&#39; side but something needed to be clarified. It was obvious that 
Aeris wanted this just as much as Tifa did but Tifa still felt that 
she had to ask anyways and broke off the kiss.

&quot;Aeris. You sure you wanna go through with this?&quot; When Aeris gave a 
perplexed look, Tifa said, &quot;I mean, you mean too much to me and I 
don&#39;t want to hurt you or make you do anything that you don&#39;t want to 
do.&quot;

&quot;You are worried about hurting me? Especially getting screwed beyond 
belief? I want this,..more than words can say.&quot; and with the saying, 
&#39;actions speak louder than words&#39;in mind, Aeris grabbed the hand that 
was on her stomach and put it up to her breast and squeezed 
encouragingly.

&quot;Aeris..&quot; Tifa seemed like she was going to say something else but 
decided against it and leaned her head down to kiss Aeris again. Tifa 
started massage the handful of tit gently right now too. Aeris gasped 
rather loudly and thrust her chest outwards.

Tifa started to gently pull and twist the nipple that was on the 
breast that she was now massaging. Aeris&#39; gasps turned into quiet 
moans of pleasure as she started to squirm a bit. Tifa moved so that 
she was over Aeris&#39; body and disengaged her kiss to bring her head 
down to the unattended tit and started to lick it. After a while, she 
started to suck and lick the nipple much to Aeris&#39; pleasure. Then she 
gently bit it and grinded her teeth against it. Aeris felt extreamly 
lightheaded and bold. Reaching her hands down, she started to play 
with Tifa&#39;s far larger breasts. Just cupping them, massaging them and 
stuff like that. Tifa&#39;s breathing pace quickened at the playfull 
ministrations of Aeris&#39; hands on her breasts.

Tifa eventually had enough of this as well however and both knew that 
you couldn&#39;t get too far on breasts alone no matter how good you were 
with them and Tifa was oddly quite good. Aeris would have to inquire 
later. Tifa disengaged Aeris&#39; breasts and promptly told her to get on 
all fours as it was a little difficult to work on someone who was 
underwater.

Just as promptly as Tifa told her to, Aeris was on her hands and 
knees, offering her bottom to Tifa to do as she (and Aeris) pleased to 
it. The combination of water and lighting made Aeris&#39; ass seem almost 
as if it were shiny and reflectant. Tifa put her hands on either cheek 
and gently squeezed and messaged them. Tifa just liked their rubbery 
feel on her hands. Aeris started to moved back and fourth, showing 
annoyance. Tifa chuckled a bit quietly and ran her hands up and down 
Aeris&#39; inner thighs, almost touching her outter lips but not quite. 
Tifa kept this up until Aeris groaned out in frustration. She tried to 
bring one hand down but slipped without the aid of it and ended up 
getting her face all wet.

Tifa decided not to tease anymore and started to stroke Aeris&#39; pussy 
lips. Aeris shivered at the touch and moaned lightly. After a minute 
of this however, Tifa started to probe around and found the hard 
little nub of pleasure. Upon stroking this, Aeris&#39; breathing quickened 
and she moaned out slightly. A little grin appeared on Tifa&#39;s face and 
she continued to do this for a while. Aeris moaned out rather loud and 
Tifa noticed Aeris get wet. Tifa remembered how good Aeris tasted off 
of the tenticle and she brought her face to Aeris&#39; snatch and with a 
long lick, she licked from bottom to top and again, Aeris shivered.

Tifa licked her lips and took another long lick. Aeris moaned out 
loudly now and a light sweat was developing on her body. It went 
mostly unoticed as she was still wet from the bath water. Tifa 
continued licking and flicking Aeris&#39; clit and after a while, Aeris 
came, screaming and yelling, her whole body trembling and bucking in 
the throes of her orgasm.

Aeris really didn&#39;t have a lot of time to recouperate from her orgasm 
but Tifa was far from done. Tifa put one of her fingers in her mouth, 
lubricating it, remembering how much Aeris liked having that tenticle 
in her ass. If it meant more pleasure for Aeris, then Tifa had no 
problem with doing it.

Tifa&#39;s other hand was far more busy than her other one, however. 
Taking a finger, Tifa slowly pushed it into Aeris warm, moist folds 
until it was all the way in. Aeris looked back over her shoulder at 
Tifa who looked back with her finger still in her mouth. Aeris thought 
that Tifa looked kind of funny like that and almost outright laughed 
at her but Tifa&#39;s finger was making it&#39;s presence known.

Slowly, Tifa began to slide her finger in and out of Aeris. Aeris 
arced her back slightly and pushed back against it instinctivly. After 
a few more experimental thrusts, Tifa withdrew her finger from Aeris 
and Aeris groaned out in dissapointment but then she moaned out in 
pleasure as the one finger was replaced with two fingers. Tifa started 
to saw them in and out of Aeris at a medium pace.

Aeris was riding the fingers in true fashion now, meeting them thrust 
for thrust. Her whole body was shaking and trembing and now her sweat 
was visable on her body. The only thing that came out of Aeris&#39; mouth 
were loud moans of hot, electric pleasure.

Tifa decided that her finger was lubed up enough and slowly, she slid 
it into Aeris&#39;s ass. Aeris&#39; body jerked and she came instantly. Her 
whole body shaking and spasming and crying out like there was no 
tomarrow, however Tifa didn&#39;t let up. She was sawing both of her hands 
in and out extreamly fast, almost instantly bringing Aeris to yet 
another orgasm. And another. And another.

Aeris was almost completly wiped out by having five rather powerful 
orgasms but felt extreamly compelled to return the favor. Sitting up 
and turning around, Aeris&#39; trembling and weak hands told her just how 
weak thoes orgasms had left her. Still forcing herself however, Aeris 
leaned forwards and kissed Tifa rather hard. They both figured it 
would leave some bruises but it was a small price to pay for the 
pleasure and happiness that it brought them.

Aeris&#39; hand gently cupped Tifa&#39;s breast and started to message it 
lightly, elicting quiet moans from the girl. Aeris kept this up for a 
while and she stared to roll Tifa&#39;s nipples in between her fingers and 
causing Tifa to groan out a little more.

Aeris slowly disengaged her mouth from Tifa&#39;s and brought her head 
down to the unattended breast and started to lick and suck at it. 
Using her free hand, Aeris started to stroke and rub at Tifa&#39;s inner 
thigh and accidently went a little too high and caused Tifa to gasp 
out involintarily. Aeris also noticed that (minus the water) Tifa was 
wet.

Aeris took her middle finger and gently slid it into Tifa causing her 
to buck a bit and moan a lot. Slowly, Aeris began to push the digit in 
and out. Tifa&#39;s breathing quickened into short gasps of breath as her 
loud moans filled the air. A light sheen of sweat covering her body 
where the water already wasn&#39;t and her scent quickly filling the air 
once again.

After a few moments of this treatment, Tifa threw her head back and 
arced her back and let out a long howl of pleasure as she came all 
over Aeris&#39; finger which was buried in her to the knuckle. Tifa&#39;s 
insides clentched her finger hard and Aeris was unable to move it at 
all, despite how wet Tifa was and I&#39;m not talking about the water.

After a few moments, Aeris was finally able to retrieve her finger and 
licked all of Tifa&#39;s cum from it. &quot;Mmm. Quite good. Quite good 
indeed!&quot; and she turned around and pulled the plug to drain the water. 
Right after, Aeris pulled the shower curtain across and turned on the 
water again. This time however, she pulled a lever and the hot water 
cascaded down over thier bodies.

Standing up, Tifa started to walk over to Aeris but weak knees 
prevented her from getting far. Aeris turned around and grabbed her 
before she could fall over completely and end up hurting herself. 
Standing in the shower, Tifa and Aeris stood there, more upon Aeris&#39; 
power then anything.

Tifa looked up and stared into Aeris&#39; deep green eyes and Aeris stared 
into Tifa&#39;s wine red eyes. Slowly, Tifa inched her head towards Aeris. 
Aeris&#39; own head leaned forward towards Tifa&#39;s and finally thier lips 
touched sending small shivers through the two women. It seemed almost 
magical to both of them this time. Sure, they kissed before only a few 
minutes ago but this was different. It seemed to solidify something. 
It was thier feelings for each other. Tifa felt it and Aeris felt it 
and there was no denying it. It was love. Tifa loved her woman that 
was held in her passionate embrace since now she was able to stand on 
her own. Aeris felt the exact same way for the woman in her arms. The 
deeds they had just recently performed seemed to be quite natural to 
them now.

Eventually, Aeris and Tifa broke off for some air. Tifa decided that 
she should tell Aeris how she felt about her. &quot;Aeris. I know I held it 
under jealousy and being bitchy towards you but now I realize that I 
was wrong.&quot; Aeris started to reply but Tifa placed her finger over 
Aeris&#39; mouth and replaced with her own for a quick kiss. &quot;Wait. I have 
to tell you or I&#39;ll hate myself forevermore. It was true. I was 
jealous of you and Cloud. But that no longer matters. What matters now 
is my feelings for you. I..I-&quot;

&quot;I love you. It truly isn&#39;t so difficult. I did it. Now you try.&quot; 
Aeris stood there looking at her friend.

&quot;Oh god Aeris! I love you more than words can say! It may be fast but 
my heart and feelings don&#39;t lie. Just whatever you do, don&#39;t *EVER* 
leave me! I love you so much!&quot; Tears were streaming down Tifa&#39;s eyes 
and she just hugged Aeris and held on like she would dissapear. Much 
like when Sephiroth fell and stole her away from them but now 
Sephiroth was gone and she was here to stay.

Aeris just hugged her back and tears of happiness and joy streamed 
down her own face. She just kept repeating &quot;I love you too, I love you 
too,....&quot;

They would have stayed like that forever if it hadn&#39;t been for the 
water to start turning cold on them. Quickly grabbing the bottle 
labled, &#39;Shampoo&#39; they quickly washed thier hair and climbed out. 
Grabbing a towel from the towel rack, they quickly dried off and upon 
looking around, they found some clothing that would suffice to cover 
themselves.

Aeris was wearing a white blouse that had a fairly low neck cut and 
showed off a generous amount of cleavage. She was also wearing some 
loose baggy pants with some patches on them. Tifa had a plaid, flannel 
shirt as well as a pair of rather large jeans. They said screw 
undergarments as they couldn&#39;t find any. Oh well.

After being all dressed, Tifa brushed out Aeris&#39; hair and then brushed 
it all back. Tifa realized that Aeris looked kinda like Sephiroth like 
this as thoes two annoying sets of bangs did thier wierd thingy. 
&#39;*&#39;Maybe they were related? Not thinking much about it, Tifa asked 
about it.

&quot;Hey Aeris, is there any chance that there was some sort of mix up? 
Maybe Sephiroth was actually Prof. Gast&#39;s kid or something? Look in 
the mirror, you look a lot like Sephiroth except for the hair color 
and the fact that you are of the opposite gender, you look exactly 
like him right now.&quot;

Uppon looking in the mirror, Aeris did see a replica of Sephiroth. An 
exact look-a-like. That was odd and actually scary. &quot;You&#39;re right. I 
do. It&#39;s possible.&quot; Aeris looked up at Tifa and they both shook their 
heads and said &#39;nah!&#39; at the same time and dismissed it. After quickly 
braiding Aeris&#39; hair, and combing her own out, they snuck downstairs 
and on the main table, there was the Premium Heart with a letter 
attached which read as follows:

&#39;*&#39; - This is a bit of a joke about the fact that all anime characters 
look the same and Aeris also has the same banges that Sephiroth did. 
This is why a few of my friends and I thought that maybe Sephiroth was 
actually Proffesor Gast&#39;s son actually. Maybe Lucreatia slept around 
at the time that Sephiroth was concieved. Gast was with them if I 
remember correctly. Anyways enough of that!

&quot; Dear Tifa,
Hello. I needed your weapon temporarily. The Sleepel spell proved most 
useful on the other inhabitants of this dwelling. Anyway, as Aeris may 
know, all of your friends are safe and sound. I&#39;m sorry about this but 
I had to do it to keep you two out of the life-stream as we all know 
that Aeris went far to early and Cloud&#39;s death was inevitable. You 
would have surely killed yourself. I was unable to resurrect him as I 
was with Aeris because in Sephiroth&#39;s death, he has proved himself no 
longer a useful asset to the Planet. You can find love in where you 
least expect it. Good luck.

-Venus-&quot;

&quot;What did Goddess Venus have to say?&quot; inquired Aeris.

&quot;That you are basically Cloud&#39;s replacement for me.&quot; Tifa replied.

Aeris was a little confused, &quot;I can&#39;t be his replacement!&quot;

&quot;No. It&#39;s true. It makes sense.&quot; Tifa cut off. &quot;Anyway, let&#39;s just go! 
If we take Goldie, we can make it to Kalm within the hour.&quot;

&quot;No way! That&#39;s impossible! It&#39;s about 150 kilometers (im *guessing* 
about 80-90 miles for thoes of you who don&#39;t understand metric) away! 
The average racing chocobo can barely reach 80 km/h much less last 
long enough to make it all the way at even 60!&quot;

Tifa just grinned. &quot;Goldie isn&#39;t your average chocobo..trust me.&quot; 
Stepping out to the barn, the moon was still high, oddly enough, it 
probably wasn&#39;t past 2am yet. Going into the last stable was the high, 
mighty and very friendly &#39;Goldie&#39;!

Aeris gasped when she seen him. Standing tall and proud. His gold 
feathers shone oddly in the moonlight. &quot;My god! I can see where he 
gets his name! He&#39;s been dyed gold!&quot; Aeris had heard of gold chocobos 
but thought that they were nothing but an old wives tale. Tifa went to 
work preparing him for the trek to Kalm.

&quot;It&#39;s natural.&quot; Tifa said with an even bigger grin. If Aeris didn&#39;t 
understand what that meant, then she most surely was dense.

&quot;You mean..th-th-that&#39;s an actual gold chocobo?!?!&quot; Aeris was 
awestruck. There were stories that these were far faster than anything 
around today except airplanes and airships.

&quot;Just you wait! This is gonna be one ride that you will never forget!&quot; 
Tifa said, and just grinned even more if it was possible.

&quot;Wow! Three &#39;rides&#39; that I&#39;ll never forget all in one day!&quot; Aeris said 
referring to the tenticle monster that was sent by Venus and Tifa&#39;s 
own work on her earlier. A blush flowed into her cheeks and upper 
chest upon recalling the aforementioned events. Tifa was no different 
in her reaction.

After a few more tugs and rope ties, Tifa said, &quot;I think were just 
about ready. I&#39;ll help you on.&quot; Tifa turned around and put her hands 
on Aeris&#39; hips. Both Tifa&#39;s and Aeris&#39; eyes were shining of love and 
hope for their future together. Their lips met as Tifa and Aeris 
indulged in a light but passionate and loving kiss.

After breaking apart, Tifa and Aeris exchanged &#39;I love yous&#39; and Tifa 
lifted Aeris onto the chocobo. Aeris wanted to sit on him sideways but 
Tifa informed her that at the speeds that this chocobo can achieve, 
she&#39;d fall off. Reluctantly, Aeris pulled her left leg over but found 
that it was either going to be too comfortable for any real conscious 
thought or it wasn&#39;t going to be comfortable at all but she would have 
to suffer.

Tifa led the chocobo out of the barn and into the field a few feet 
from the house. Tifa then jumped on behind Aeris and with a pull of 
the reins, they were off. And almost literally. If it hadn&#39;t been for 
Tifa being behind Aeris, she would have fallen off. Aeris was amazed 
as the scenery just whizzed by them. Every minute, 2.5 kilometers of 
scenery passed them.

Aeris relaxed after about 15 minutes and simply leaned back against 
Tifa. Tifa started to stroke Aeris&#39; hair when she realized that it was 
still drenched.

&quot;Hey Aeris, think you could stick your head out the side for a minute 
or 2? It&#39;ll be the fastest blowdrier ever!&quot; Holding onto Tifa and Tifa 
holding on to her, Aeris did as asked and stuck her head out the side, 
away from the protection of the chocobo&#39;s head that kept the wind out 
of the riders faces.

After a minute, Aeris brought her head back in and much to her 
suprise, it was quite dry. Relaxing again, Aeris leaned back against 
Tifa and her head more or less used Tifa&#39;s large breasts as a pillow. 
Tifa held the reins with one hand and stroked Aeris&#39; soft, brown hair 
with the other.

Then Aeris said it again. &quot;You were right about this. This whole day 
has been a ride that I&#39;ll never forget for as long as I live as long 
as I live long. (Confusing eh?)

Both Aeris and Tifa chuckled at the wierd wording of that. Tifa 
responded with, &quot;I love you too, Aeris. I love you too.&quot;

Both were quiet for the rest of the trip. Mainly because Aeris fell 
asleap and Tifa felt too comfortable with Aeris lying against her to 
want to disturb her. After about 45 more minutes, they had reached 
their destination. Kalm.

Tifa woke Aeris up and asked her to climb off after they had stopped 
outside the village. After quickly tying up the chocobo to a nearby 
post, Tifa and Aeris made a silent decision to stay at the inn before 
they went shopping the next morning. But first, they needed money. How 
was a rather quick way to make it? Tifa looked at the Premium Heart 
and kicked herself in the head. She would never need any of the 
mastered materia on it... The materia shop was open 24/7. They could 
sell any of the mastered materia and fetch an extreamly high price for 
them.

&quot;We well have to make a stop at the materia shop first Aeris. I&#39;ve 
gotta sell some of this materia or we wont have any money to stay at 
the inn or buy new clothes. These aren&#39;t very comfortable.&quot;

&quot;I agree.&quot; was all Aeris replied as she looked down at the amount of 
cleavage that the shirt she wore showed off.

After making their way to the north end of the town, Tifa had sold her 
mastered hp plus, mp plus and the materia that had sleepel in it. (Why 
the hell can&#39;t I remember the name of that damn materia?!?!) And she 
had enough money to buy the villa in Costa De Sol if only Cloud hadn&#39;t 
bought it already after selling one of his mastered All materia to a 
crazy materia seller who bought it for 1,400,000 gil&#39;**&#39;. Not that 
they ever stayed there anyway.

Quickly making their way to the inn, Tifa decided that she needed to 
find a place to keep all her cash..thoes pockets just wern&#39;t having a 
good time trying to hold all the money.

The Inn keeper looked them up and down and said, &quot;I&#39;ve only got one 
room left.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s alright. Will this cover it?&quot; inquired Tifa with a grin as she 
dropped a few 500 Gil pieces on the counter.

&quot;Are you sure you want to just hand over that much money? There&#39;s 2, 
3, 4000 Gil here!&quot; said the Inn keeper as he gawked at the amount that 
was just haphazardly thrown on the counter like it was nothing.

&quot;Trust me. I have a *LOT* more where that came from.&quot; said Tifa. The 
keeper just nodded and waved his hand towards the book for them to 
sign in. After Tifa and Aeris jotted down thier names, the Inn keeper 
gave them a key and said that thier room was the 1st room on the 
right.

Just outside their door, Aeris was locked in a hot-n-hungry tongue 
twister with Tifa as Tifa fumbled with the key to get in the room. 
Finally unlocking the door, they quickly shuffled into the room and 
Tifa lightly kicked the door shut behind them. She threw the room keys 
on the nearby stand before falling backwards into the bed and Aeris 
fell on top of her lightly.

(I bet you thought all of the sex was over didn&#39;t you? I had you 
totally fooled! HAHA. Sorry...)

Still kissing extreamly passionatly, Tifa and Aeris started to play 
with each others breasts through thier shirts. Aeris slowly unbuttoned 
Tifa&#39;s shirt while she still kissed her. Finally all of the pesky 
buttons were undone and Aeris brushed the shirt apart at the front 
exposing Tifa&#39;s large breasts to her eyes.

Aeris grabbed both breasts and started to message them lightly. Aeris 
stopped kissing Tifa for a moment and leaned back to admire Tifa&#39;s 
beautiful body. It was still beautiful even if she could only see the 
top half of her since Aeris was straddling Tifa.

First, Aeris rubbed her hands over Tifa&#39;s stomach which was fairly 
tight with muscle. It was obvious that she did her fair share of 
stomach crunches/sit ups. Soon however, this stomach would no longer 
be so flat. But it would be even more beautiful in a different way.

Slowly moving her hands further up, Aeris&#39;s hands came to rest once 
again on Tifa&#39;s large breasts. Aeris gently kneaded them and Tifa let 
out a light moan of pleasure. Tifa&#39;s breasts were large and firm yet 
very yielding to Aeris&#39; hands.

Leaving Tifa&#39;s breasts, Aeris drew her hands upwards to Tifa&#39;s neck 
and face. Tifa had a very beautiful face and a long, slender neck. 
Aeris tickled the area of Tifa&#39;s neck where the two colorbones met and 
made a hollow in it, with her tongue. Tifa giggled slightly moved her 
hands to the sides of Aeris&#39;s shirt and pulled it up over Aeris&#39; head. 
Tifa wasn&#39;t exactly happy with Aeris checking her out in depth and not 
returning the favor.

Aeris moved her head up now and lightly and quickly kissed Tifa and 
then moved over to Tifa&#39;s ear and whispered, &quot;Tifa. You are very 
beautiful. Cloud was a fool not to really notice you.&quot;

Tifa whispered back, &quot;Hey! Don&#39;t be talking! You&#39;re no different but 
thanks anyways. I&#39;ll have to reward you for your nice compliments.&quot; 
Both girls were blushing a bright red right now. Tifa moved her hand a 
little lower and started to message Aeris&#39; tits.

However, Aeris was always satisfied first and thought that it was 
Tifa&#39;s turn this time. &quot;Uh uh! Not this time. You first this time. I 
think it&#39;s your turn to be first.&quot; Aeris layed a quick kiss to Tifa&#39;s 
lips before moving down to her large breasts, leaving a light trail of 
kisses all the way down to Tifa&#39;s left tit. Aeris went straight for 
the nipple with a vengeance. She licked circles around it causing Tifa 
to arc her back trying to get even more of the wonderous sensations 
that were ripping through her like electricity. Aeris used one hand to 
knead and massage Tifa&#39;s other breast and her hand traveled downwards 
and rubbed Tifa&#39;s thigh.

Tifa moved her hands down to the pants and started to undo them but 
the hand on her thigh stopped her and Aeris stopped her playing with 
Tifa&#39;s breast to say, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about that. I&#39;ll get to it..&quot; and 
resumed her sucking, licking, biting and pulling. Tifa didn&#39;t have any 
real problem with it but simply wanted to get on with it.

Soon, however, Tifa&#39;s wants were answered. Aeris left Tifa&#39;s breasts 
and left another trail of light kisses and stopped when she came to 
her pants. Aeris pulled down the zipper and undid the button. Then she 
grabbed at the sides of Tifa&#39;s pants and pulled them down exposing her 
brown pubic hair.

Instantly, Tifa&#39;s scent wafted into the air and was picked up by 
Aeris&#39; nose and started to drive her crazy with lust. Aeris almost 
literally, just &#39;dug in&#39;. Saying screw everything else, Aeris started 
to lap at Tifa furiously. Tifa immediatly grabbed the blankets and 
squeezed them as she moaned out in pleasure and wrapped her legs 
around Aeris&#39; head. Aeris swirled her tongue around Tifa&#39;s folds and 
occasionally poking her tongue inside of Tifa.

Aeris found Tifa&#39;s clitoris and used her fingers to stroke it. Tifa 
bucked wildly as the sensations of pleasure raced through her body. 
Her every nerve was on fire. Gradually, the pleasure built up inside 
of her.

Aeris plunged two fingers into Tifa&#39;s depths and began to slide them 
in and out with ease while licking Tifa&#39;s inflamed jewel. Tifa for her 
part, was crying out in pleasure and squirming all over the bed. It 
was fortunate for the walls to be solid concrete and the room to be 
basically sound proof or they would have had many angry people 
knocking on their door.

After just a minute more of this, Tifa couldn&#39;t take it anymore and 
her whole body locked up and stars and firewords flashed in her mind 
as she had an extreamly powerful orgasm. Aeris cursed under her breath 
as her fingers were being crushed by Tifa&#39;s pussy clamping down on 
them. For a few seconds, Tifa was silent and then she yelled out 
loudly as her orgasm peaked. Just one long scream really.

As soon as Tifa&#39;s scream had stopped, Aeris was able to retrieve her 
sore fingers. Slowly, Aeris stuck the first one in her mouth and 
sucked all of the juice off of it. Then she did the same with the 
other and then climbed over Tifa and kissed her passionatly.

&quot;Oh god I love you! I&#39;m not gonna let you go for anything!&quot; Tifa 
huffed, still being out of breath. &quot;Now, I just gotta return the 
favor.&quot;

&quot;Oh! That&#39;s already taken care of.&quot; Aeris said with a mischievious 
look on her face. When Tifa gave a puzzled look for a response, Aeris 
continued with, &quot;Don&#39;t worry! I wanna try something new though.&quot; and 
with that, Aeris quickly discarded her remaining clothing (a pair of 
pants.) and climbed back on top of Tifa and started to kiss her again.

Aeris was laying down on top of Tifa. Then deliberatly, she ground her 
hips against Tifa&#39;s so thier clits rubbed together. This caused both 
girls to moan out in pleasure. Then Aeris swirled her hips a bit and 
this caused them to moan out even more. Then Aeris lifted her hips and 
this time, when they went back down, they were met half-way as Tifa 
lifted her hips at the same time as Tifa brought hers down. It was far 
more intimate than any other way they tried it yet.

&quot;Oh god Aeris! Oh god! Oh yes Aeris!&quot; Tifa moaned out as they bumped 
together and grinded.

&quot;Mmm. Tifa. Ohh.&quot; Aeris&#39; moaning was lighter but held just as much 
meaning. After a moment, Aeris brought her head down and continued to 
kiss Tifa passionatly and Tifa wrapped her arms around Aeris and 
hugged her tight and kissed back even harder, their tongues having a 
duel in which there was no loser, only winners.

Soon however, Aeris felt the first forthcomings of a building orgasm 
as did Tifa. This one was gonna be big too. Their pace quickened as 
they raced to get the release they so craved. It hit Aeris first but 
not a moment later, it also hit Tifa.

&quot;TIIIIIIIFFFAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!&quot; cried Aeris as her peak hit her and 
she ground her hips especially hard against Tifa&#39;s and this triggered 
hers.

&quot;OH GOD AERIS! OH GOOOOAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!&quot; and Tifa was bucking and 
shaking as much as Aeris was.

After a while, Aeris and Tifa both calmed down to the point of being 
speech capable.

&quot;Wow...&quot; was all Tifa could say. She had two extreamly powerful 
orgasms and was left speechless.

&quot;Like that huh?&quot; Aeris asked. Tifa just nodded fiercly. Aeris giggled 
and rolled off of Tifa and hugged her close. She whispered in Tifa&#39;s 
ear, &quot;I love you.&quot;

Tifa whispered lightly back to her, &quot;I love you too but if you ever 
think of leaving me, you have another thing coming!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think you will have anything to worry about. I wouldn&#39;t leave 
you for anything!&quot; Aeris leaned over and kissed just under Tifa&#39;s ear 
before snuggling up to her and wrapping her arms around Tifa and said 
one last thing before falling asleep, &quot;I don&#39;t think anyone could 
replace my teddy bear!&quot;

Tifa snuggled closer enjoying the warmth of Aeris&#39; body against her 
own. Quickly, Tifa reached down to the end of the bed and pulled the 
blankets over herself and Aeris and fell into a deep, soothing sleep 
even though daylight would rear it&#39;s head in less than an hour.

Authors Notes: Hi. Well, there you have it, my FF VII lemon. I&#39;m 
personally not exactly proud of this one though. I guess you found out 
that I&#39;m not a fan of Cloud or Locke eh? Nah! They&#39;re pretty cool 
characters,..I just have some sort of mental problem that screams at 
me to kill the main male character of every game that I play. Who 
knows eh? I promise not to continue to do it unless you guys say that 
you want me to. -_-; Anyways, if, however you like this and want to 
see a sequel of sorts, GO AWAY! I already fucked Tifa and Aeris&#39; 
characters up beyond belief!
