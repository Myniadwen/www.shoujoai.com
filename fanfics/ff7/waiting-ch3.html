<a href="../ff7/waiting-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>The black color in her hair was fading, giving way to gray, the color of old
age. Slowly and quietly she rocked back and forth in her chair. Her eyes were
dull and faded, having seen many things in her life, not always good. A few
years after *his* death she had moved to Mideel and helped rebuild it. Her home
was on the outskirts of the town, and the forests were everywhere around her.
She didn&#39;t live in loneliness, though she helped raise Marlene when Barret was
gone. Off on some new plot to save the world. It was one of the best things for
her, she had realized what she had done with her life...

Middle aged woman: &quot;Auntie Tifa, how are you today?&quot;

Tifa: &quot;My bones are sore, I can barely see, and I&#39;m on the verge of crying
constantly. Otherwise I&#39;m fine, Marlene.&quot;

Marlene had to chuckle at Tifa&#39;s bluntness. Everyday she asked how she was
doing, and everyday Tifa said the same thing in her own cynical way. Then,
Marlene made a serious expression on her face, she obviously was distressed.

Marlene: &quot;Poppa... Poppa died yesterday.&quot;

Tifa: &quot;Oh my! Now Barret? I&#39;m sorry... how did it happen?&quot;

Tifa had seen this happen many times, all of her friends dying one by one. She
wished she could join them, but life was cruel, it kept her from greeting her
loved ones in the afterlife. 

Aeris had died at the hands of Sephiroth. Reeve had been hit by a truck,
subsequently leaving Cait Sith inoperable. Vincent had taken his own life, the
pressure too much. Cid died of lung cancer a few years back, leaving his new
wife Shera and two children behind. Yuffie just disappeared, no one ever saw
her again. And... Cloud. The thought made her lifeless eyes sharpen. His last
words still echoed in her mind, and it enraged her. Someone she had spent so
much time and love on, rejected her in the end. Morbidly, she was glad he WAS
dead, that she hadn&#39;t wasted the rest of her life with him. But now Barret...

Marlene: &quot;He was assassinated, some political movement that didn&#39;t agree with
his views to rebuilding Midgar.&quot;

Tifa: &quot;Oh my, how horrible...&quot;

It was only her and Nanaki now. The thoughts saddened her greatly, and the
tears streamed down her face. 

Marlene: &quot;Don&#39;t cry Tifa. It&#39;s ok.&quot;

Tifa raised her wrinkled hands to her head and covered her face. She didn&#39;t
want anyone to see her like this. 

Tifa: &quot;I think... well can you help me into bed? I&#39;m feeling very tired. My
body just isn&#39;t what it used to be.&quot;

She looked up to her little girl, wiped the tears away and smiled half
heartedly. Marlene looked down at her sympathetically.

Marlene: &quot;Ok.&quot;

The younger woman lifted Tifa out of her rocking chair, and half carried, half
pulled Tifa to her room. She set her down in the bed and tucked the sheet in
over her.

Marlene: &quot;Goodnight. Don&#39;t let the bed bugs bite.&quot;

Lazily, Tifa looked over to her and smiled before drifting off into dreamland.
