&quot;Freedom means choosing your burden.&quot; Hephzibah Menuhin

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Was it cruel morning already?

She squeezed her eyes shut and curled her body into a tighter ball, 
wincing as her agued muscles screamed in defiance and then explosively, 
sighed and laid out straight on the fold out padded bench she&#39;d used as 
a makeshift bed in the cell that was under-equipped for two people to 
share. One hand, still gloved from her exhausted state where she hadn&#39;t 
even had the strength to pull it off the night previous, came up to 
brush her fringe from her eyes. Tifa reminded herself to get a haircut 
for what seemed like the hundredth time since starting their flight into 
the ShinRa building.

Her senses, fine tuned by hours of survival training, martial arts and 
meditation immediately logged onto something being wrong; the air in the 
room wasn&#39;t musty, it held a coppery tang of blood and there was a 
heavier breeze than what the ventilation (poor as it was) had offered. 
She sat up, swinging her legs around in a smooth motion just as Cloud 
came belting through the door at breakneck speed.

She studied him thoughtfully for a brief, split second. Since they had 
become so heavily involved with fighting ShinRa this past week or so, he 
had changed. She knew it wasn&#39;t her influence at all. She&#39;d spent weeks, 
months trying to coax him from that shell of lies he&#39;d woven, the 
mistruths he told and she only enforced feebly because she didn&#39;t know 
what else to do, to help her friend. His eyes were brighter, stronger 
and he stood erect now, instead of slumping weakly at every word passed 
in his direction. There was purpose in the man that little crybaby 
Strife had grown up to be.

It broke her heart to think that his new found confidence was misplaced 
on a world he remembered only half correctly.

But then her sharp eyes noticed that the hand which gripped the 
doorframe was doused in blood, leaving ugly, congealing smears. She 
stood almost instantly, quickly retying her hair so it wouldn&#39;t waft 
about too much and into her face. &quot;Cloud?&quot; She frowned, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;Take a look outside.&quot;

She needed no second urging, realising with a pang of cold fear that 
their door was wedged wide open. Tifa brushed past him and ran the short 
distance to the end of the hall, skidding to a screeching stop so 
quickly her heavy duty shoes left rubber marks. The intersection of the 
hallway was decorated with the broken and twisted body of the guard. His 
head lay at a very unnatural angle and his eyes bulged with whatever it 
was he had seen before his unfortunate demise.

She bit her lip and swallowed; she was used to seeing such things, but 
it still made her confused and a little upset that anything should have 
to pass along in such a cruel way.

&quot;I wonder what happened,&quot; she breathed, dark eyes boring intently as 
they flicked over the wounds sustained and the bloody puddle spread 
underneath the dead sprawl of the luckless guard.

&quot;He should have the key on him,&quot; Cloud said from behind her.

Her skin crawled, watching him coolly lean down with a bend of his knees 
and rifle the pockets, entirely unmindful of the blood and where he 
knelt. She was glad she wasn&#39;t the one do to his washing &#150; what a 
ridiculous thing to fixate on, Tifa scolded herself.

&quot;Here,&quot; He stood and wiped hands on his knees; she couldn&#39;t help but 
blanch slightly at that, then she reached out and took the offered key 
card to Aerith&#39;s cell. &quot;You fetch her, I&#39;ll get the others.&quot;

She nodded and turned away. Perhaps she should blindfold the flower girl 
so she wouldn&#39;t see the gory spatter of horror limning the walls in 
lurid detail. Aerith&#39;s cell was the closest one to the guard too and 
before she ran the card though the slot, Tifa hesitated, wondering what 
to tell the fragile beauty about what had occurred outside.

&quot;Tifa?&quot; the quiet voice said from inside, and she jumped, fumbling the 
card three or four times in a juggling act. She must have heard the 
voices from outside, the fighter crossly reminded herself and once she 
had a firm grip on the slippery card, ran it though the machine. It 
beeped and changed the green, the door sliding open.

Inside, Aerith was stood calmly in the centre of the room, holding one 
hand to the curious braided necklace and her face was pale. Down the 
smooth cheeks, tears cut tracks of salt.

&quot;Aerith...why...&quot; she said, lowering her hands and forgetting the 
cushioning lies.

&quot;His spirit cried out so loudly... so... so loudly,&quot; The flower girl 
closed her eyes and swallowed, &quot;There was something else, someone else 
rather. He came like a black shadow... and he just killed because he 
could.&quot;

Tifa could see the girl was shaking and moved swiftly to take those 
hands, the braided necklace was looking a little too strained and tight 
around the slender neck, and squeezed them. &quot;Aerith, I forgot 
completely... I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; those green eyes looked fretfully upwards, what was it she seeing 
so far away? &quot;I wonder if it was... ...him...&quot;

&quot;Him?&quot; Tifa locked puzzled brows together, but before she could wonder 
further, Cloud came into the room and gestured to her. She nodded, &quot;What 
news?&quot;

&quot;Red said someone non human did it,&quot; did his eyes flicker to Aerith? She 
drew the girl closer, protectively, &quot;So he went on ahead. We&#39;ll follow 
and catch up.&quot;

&quot;What about Barrett?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s gonna clean the mess up.&quot;

&quot;Alright,&quot; Tifa nodded and turned to Aerith, &quot;I want you to close your 
eyes; it&#39;s a pretty horrible mess.&quot;

&quot;Tifa,&quot; the smile was warm and just for her, her heart glowed, &quot;I don&#39;t 
mind seeing it, but I think you mind more than I do.&quot;

&quot;Well... of course, it&#39;s just...&quot;

Cloud coughed and both girls looked towards him. Aerith moved away 
first, drifting and fading from Tifa&#39;s hand as she gravitated towards 
Cloud and she looked down, tucking her arms about herself.

...what was I thinking?

She joined the pair, that feeling of being part of something greater 
settling over her again strangely; she could see the same look in their 
eyes, the wonder of it. No, she wouldn&#39;t question what it was Fate had 
in store for her... instead she would simply go along with it all as 
best as she could.

Together they wandered cautiously down the corridor, their weapons 
hidden in a locker by the guard that Barrett had discovered the key for. 
Aerith held her staff defensively, sometimes using it to gently prod at 
things. Cloud seemed to hang back as a type of rear guard, leaving her 
to press on ahead of them. The silence was deafening, before this level 
had been a bustle of industrious, scientific activity. Now...

They came across several bodies along the way, all at strange angles 
with either limbs or neck positions. Aerith never once cried out, her 
face was entirely blank and smooth but her hands turned white knuckled 
on the staff she carried. Once or twice she even tried to hide the body 
before they got close enough, but her sheer physical strength for inert 
bodies was lacking.

They eventually came to the grates and chipped paint signs that 
signalled the underbelly of the lab above. There was a vast bloody smear 
along the floor and they followed it, much like a yellow brick road, but 
this one led directly to the furry fiery creature called Red. His single 
yellow eye glowed with some dark humour and his grizzled demeanour was 
less than impressed. Tifa came close to him, eyes flitting over the 
elaborate headdress that Red wore, dangling with beads and threading, 
but stiffened so it was a sharp pronged instrument to aid him in battle.

He swung his triangular head around and his muzzle split with a grim, 
long toothed grimace. &quot;Jenova Specimen.&quot;

Tifa stared at the container; it had housed the body of Jenova, the head 
long since severed. Now the thick iron and steel has been ruptured, 
leaving nothing, not even fluid or scraps of skin inside. Her skin tried 
to goose-bump.

&quot;Looks like it went to the upper floor, using that elevator for 
specimens,&quot; he nodded to it, and then bounded off towards it.

Tifa glanced at Cloud, seeing the horror reflected in his face that she 
knew was painting her own. His blue eyes met hers and she swallowed, 
looking away as sweat beaded her brow. Aerith, not grasping this 
exchange fully yet, had started after Red, so they followed.

The experiments Hojo had performed on creatures, they had all been 
turned loose upon them and they fought their way bitterly to the next 
floor, amidst slippery blood patches and strange scratching marks on the 
floor, as if something were dragged to leave a long groove behind it. 
Tifa stopped trying to figure it out, huddling in the elevator.

Jenova was loose, Jenova was free. The nightmare was real again.

Suddenly Aerith, who was beside her reached over and took her hand, 
holding it gently but firmly. In the light of the elevator shaft 
whizzing along, she could see the faint smile she gave. &quot;When I was 
little,&quot; she said softly, &quot;This particular area was my home.&quot;

&quot;...not a very pleasant home, is it?&quot; Tifa tried vainly, tried to smile, 
tried to find something cheerful inside the well of black despair eating 
away at her confidence.

&quot;Not really,&quot; the flower girl sighed.

The doors opened and Red was already by another smear stain, shaking his 
head and with a cry he bounded off, yelling: &quot;It leads up!&quot;

&quot;Up?&quot; Tifa frowned, &quot;Again?&quot;

&quot;...the President,&quot; Cloud murmured.

They followed, Tifa having to stop and help Aerith from slipping through 
the streaky blood and Cloud rummaging through the stock for potions and 
ether to strengthen their bond to the precious magical orbs in times of 
need. The smears curved around a corridor, drawing up towards the 
pinnacle of the building. Like previous times, the door was wedge open 
with deep mars and together they ventured in and up the stairs.

The &#145;penthouse&#39; of ShinRa Inc was spacious, with a few desks and drinks 
machines, a vast lounge and rest area and what looked to be offices for 
management, like Scarlet and Heidegger. The smears went on past these 
and towards the stairs that spiralled up, one either side of the end of 
the lounge room, towards what would be the presidential offices. Tifa 
remembered this from their previous &#145;visit&#39; to the old man who ran 
ShinRa with an iron fist and a greedy heart.

Slowly they wandered along, Barrett rejoining them and wiping his hand 
down on his slacks as he did. Tifa smiled in relief upon seeing him, but 
tightened her hand on Aerith&#39;s.

The suite was as she remembered it; vast open plan with a simple wide 
desk in the same cool surface they used on all the desks. It was clean, 
cold, and efficient.

Everything, apart from the figure slumped over the desk with...

She froze. Cloud froze with a strangled cry. Barrett hurried around the 
back and felt for the President&#39;s pulse then shook his head, &quot;Nope, he&#39;s 
dead. The leader of ShinRa Inc is dead.&quot;

&quot;Then,&quot; she stammered, &quot;T-then that sword must be...&quot;

...Sephiroth... Soldier... ShinRa... I hate them all...

...I hate them all...

Her hands trembled, eyes creasing with the effort of not breaking into 
wild tears and running as far away from this place as possible, dimly 
hearing what Cloud said. &quot;Sephiroth&#39;s...&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s alive?&quot; she half pleaded, half questioned. The fire, the burning 
fire... The pain in her heart and in her lungs... Too much smoke... Tifa 
felt dizzy and gripped harder onto Aerith who reached up to support her 
silently.

&quot;Looks like it, only Sephiroth can use that sword.&quot;

That sword.

&quot;Who cares who did it,&quot; Barrett laughed, not sensing their mood, &quot;This 
means the end of ShinRa Inc!&quot;

A sudden movement caught their attention; Fat man Palmer to be precise, 
cowering knock kneed behind a palm plant suddenly rushed out to try and 
escape. Only they blocked his way and he fell back, blubbering. Up 
close, he wasn&#39;t a sight for sore eyes... really. His face was covered 
in pimples from the amount of pure sugar he must ingest every hour, his 
teeth looking less than desirable and his eyes, pig like and a watery 
blue. &quot;P-p-please don&#39;t kill me!&quot; he wailed.

&quot;What happened,&quot; Cloud demanded, putting his foot close to Palmer&#39;s 
hand.

The fat man quailed and rolled his eyes from one person to the next. 
Tifa just stared at him, stared hard. &quot;Se... Sephiroth came...&quot;

&quot;Did you see him?&quot; The Solder&#39;s voice went quiet, intent, &quot;Did you see 
Sephiroth?&quot;

&quot;Y-yeah I saw him! I saw him with my own eyes!&quot;

&quot;You really saw him?&quot;

&quot;Uh, would I lie to you?&quot; he swallowed and amended, &quot;...er ...at a time 
like this? And I heard his voice too... something about not letting us 
have the Promised Land.&quot;

Tifa looked across at Aerith quickly as she gasped and covered her 
mouth, shaking her head. Sephiroth was after the Promised Land too? What 
did that mean for the fragile girl stood by her side? She frowned and 
looked back, confused again. She was always confused... and it only 
seemed to be getting worse. &quot;So what does that mean? Does the Promised 
Land really exist and Sephiroth is here to save it from ShinRa?&quot;

Barrett rubbed his dogtags, &quot;So... he&#39;s a good guy then?&quot;

&quot;Good guy?&quot; Cloud suddenly shouted, &quot;Save the Promised Land? No way! 
It&#39;s not that simple... I know him. Sephiroth&#39;s mission is different!&quot;

He was shaking and as they all stared at him, Palmer managed to wriggle 
his fat self free of them and make a wheezing exit from the building to 
a Helicopter which had arrived without their notice, hovering just 
beyond. Barrett suddenly kicked the desk and cursed, cursed deeply in 
some very inventive ways. &quot;Rufus! I forgot about him...&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;s that?&quot; She asked anyone who was bothering to listen right now.

&quot;The President&#39;s son,&quot; Barrett supplied.

&quot;...Rufus ShinRa,&quot; Aerith murmured sadly, bowing her head. Tifa stared 
at her.

I sleep and the whole world goes mad simply to confuse me, that&#39;s it, 
isn&#39;t it? Why should that ShinRa trouble her so? Well... apart from 
being ShinRa, obviously...

Cloud started after Palmer, Red and Barrett close behind but she took a 
moment to look at Aerith. Slowly those green eyes came up to meet hers, 
swimming with regret, sadness and loneliness, memories of the past 
reflected in those beautiful eyes. &quot;...we should follow,&quot; Tifa said 
gently.

&quot;...&quot;

Tifa didn&#39;t wait for an argument, dragging the girl along with her and 
outside the building. This high up, the wind was strong and echoed about 
them with vicious harmonies and howling words, bitter dirges and she was 
forced to raised her hands now and them to damp her hair down. The two 
girls came behind Cloud and the others, she holding her wild hair down. 
Aerith paid her shimmering locks no attention, they whipped about her in 
a fey manner, her dress moulding sometimes to her legs, sometimes daring 
to flare up to her thigh.

Before them stood a young man, about Aerith&#39;s age or so, she would have 
guessed, with strawberry blond hair and a handsome face. His blue eyes 
were cold and distant though, as cold as the white he wrapped himself in 
suit wise. A creature looking a cross between a panther and goodness 
knows what else lurked close by the helicopter. So this was the dreaded 
Rufus ShinRa, the man no one had seen cry.

&quot;So,&quot; he said in clipped tones, &quot;Sephiroth was actually here. Who are 
you guys?&quot;

&quot;Cloud, former Soldier first class.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m an Avalanche member!&quot;

&quot;Same here,&quot; Tifa affirmed.

&quot;A research specimen.&quot;

Aerith stared hard at Rufus and, Tifa realised, his blue eyes were fixed 
on the girl with shock suddenly illuminating them, shock and raw grief, 
&quot;A flower girl, from the slums,&quot; she said. Her tone dared him to label 
her otherwise.

&quot;...sweet little Aer&#39;,&quot; she could have sworn he murmured, then the 
distant look returned to his blue eyes. He started pacing, &quot;My, my. What 
a crew! I&#39;m Rufus, President of ShinRa Inc.&quot;

&quot;Yer only President &#145;cause yer old man died,&quot; Barrett hollered.

Rufus graced him with a smile, frosty as it was. &quot;That&#39;s right... I&#39;ll 
let you hear my new speech... Old man tried to control the world with 
money. It seems to have been working. The population thought that ShinRa 
would protect. Work at ShinRa, get your pay. But if a terrorist 
attacks,&quot; he smirked at Barrett, &quot;The ShinRa army will help you. It 
looks perfect on the outside, but I do things differently. I&#39;ll control 
the world with fear. It takes too much to do it like my old man. A 
little fear will control the minds of the common people, no need to 
waste money on them...&quot;

&quot;He likes to make speeches,&quot; she drawled, watching him over her nails 
which she pretended to examine in an insulting fashion. &quot;Just like his 
father.&quot;

Cloud whirled suddenly; he seemed to have noticed how Rufus&#39; gaze was 
lingering on Aerith, &quot;Get out of this building with her.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; the burly man squawked, staring at Cloud like he finally had 
flipped out.

&quot;I&#39;ll explain later, but... this is the real crisis for the Planet.&quot;

&quot;The hell&#39;s that supposed to mean!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you later, just take my word for it.&quot; Cloud glanced to Tifa 
and then to Aerith, blue eyes softening briefly. &quot;I&#39;ll come after you 
once I&#39;ve dealt with him...&quot;

&quot;Aw&#39;right,&quot; Barrett turned and began ushering them along, &quot;Later Cloud!&quot;

Tifa struggled, trying to see what was going on but she was being herded 
down the stairs and from the suit by Barrett. Aerith too, looked 
similarly distracted, her fingers seemed to be too tight on the metal 
pole she used as a guarding staff, her hair still messed up from the 
high winds of the building and her steps not as sure as they were. Soon 
they entered the Lounge and on the verge of going through the door, Tifa 
stopped stubbornly.

This was wrong. She&#39;d abandoned Cloud before, by letting him drop away 
into nothing. She&#39;d always been on the sideline, waiting and taking 
orders. Something inside her finally snapped and she held her ground, 
hands clenched and eyes resolute.

&quot;Cloud,&quot; Aerith said ahead of her, seeing Tifa stop, &quot;I just thought of 
something...&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;ll wait here for him,&quot; she drew a shaky breath. &quot;Everyone get to 
the elevator.&quot;

&quot;But,&quot; the flower girl said softly.

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine, go... check your equipment.&quot;

Aerith looked over her materia, and then quietly pressed one of them 
back into Tifa&#39;s hand; the sense material she&#39;d given her days previous 
in the sewers under sector six and the train graveyard. Tifa smiled and 
curled her fingers about the yellow orb, understanding. The Ancient 
nodded in turn and then with the beast and Barrett, ran through another 
door.

Nothing will get past me, Cloud... and I&#39;ll be here for you this time. 
Tifa flexed her hands, hearing the sound of the experiments crawling up 
from the lab, skin crawling in unison with their sounds; after all, you 
shouldn&#39;t throw away useless things.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

It was taking everything inside of her to maintain the spells used for 
healing, summoning up the last dredges of her talent and skill to make 
the wind blow and revitalise them. A body came across her own slender 
one, forcing her down to the ground as the shattering explosion echoed 
out for the second time on the lift. The wind whistled past, the 
protective glass long since destroyed by the gunner machines and she 
looked out across the city that they were rapidly sinking down into.

Red slowly got off her and shook himself free of metal shards, tongue 
lolling out of his mouth as a wet pink strip.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said softly.

&quot;Think nothing of it, Ancient.&quot;

Aerith&#39;s eyes crinkled with her smile and she reached over to stroke his 
fur. She knew he protested vocally against it, but secretly loved the 
sensation of attention and companionship. Soon she straightened and 
stretched, arms to the sky as the lift whirred into telling them that 
they would soon be on the ground floor. &quot;Just call me Aerith.&quot;

&quot;An old name,&quot; the golden eye twinkled.

&quot;I suppose. My mother chose it for me. I think its good enough. 
Barrett?&quot; she called over, &quot;What do we do after this?&quot;

&quot;Back to Sector 7 and then, well, we plan from there.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; She folded her arms about her waist and watched the ground floor 
open up before them, lift doors sliding back into place. Barrett hurried 
out first and she followed him, dress whispering quietly on her legs.

She&#39;d never seen any of ShinRa below perhaps the 67th level. It looked 
to be a reasonable area, spacious, comfortable, designed for the 
populace to come in and buy ShinRa stock and produce, even check up on 
the latest developments, such as car prototypes and the like. The floor 
was marble and led to the vast main doors with booths that security 
guards would stand in and watch the others pass in and out from.

They ran quickly to the main doors and just as she was reaching for the 
knob to open a glass partition, Barrett grabbed her by the waist and 
hauled her back from a barrage of bullets. She yelped and covered her 
eyes.

Their precious Ancient, they just won&#39;t ever let me go will they Mother?

&quot;We&#39;re surrounded,&quot; the burly man said, holding her back from the fire, 
&quot;If I was alone, this wouldn&#39;t be a thing... but I got a reputation to 
protect!&quot;

&quot;You,&quot; she said softly, drawing both gazes, &quot;You all get out whilst you 
still can. It&#39;s me they&#39;re after, not you.&quot;

&quot;Yeah well, that ain&#39;t happening.&quot;

She stared at him, seeing what Tifa did in this large man and often foul 
language &#150; the softness of his heart and the goodness in his soul. She 
smiled waveringly, tears threatening to spring up in her eyes.

&quot;You got caught up in this over Marlene. Now it&#39;s my turn to watch out 
for you.&quot;

&quot;...&quot; she breathed.

He turned away and grinned like a madman, hoisting his gun arm 
recklessly, &quot;Ok, playtime&#39;s over for you jackasses!&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Mr Barrett...&quot; She bent her head respectfully, hair covering 
her face and the tears she wasn&#39;t as good at controlling; emotional as 
ever and swayed by the simplest of things to compassionate tears.

&quot;Who you callin&#39; Mr Barrett? That jus&#39; don&#39;t sound right!&quot;

&quot;Well then, if you&#39;re both through talking, might I suggest we try and 
find a way out of here?&quot; The creature swayed his fiery tail, looking at 
them both reprovingly. To her credit, she felt her cheeks heating and 
grinned in spite of it.

&quot;So what are we gonna do?&quot; Barrett demanded.

&quot;Barrett!&quot;

Aerith whirled, it was Tifa, waving from by one of the car stands, 
trying to get them to come closer. &quot;She&#39;s alright!&quot; she laughed happily, 
wiping her cheeks and began to run across to her, her two companions 
stood in surprise staring.

&quot;Tifa, where&#39;s Cloud!&quot;

&quot;Everyone, over here,&quot; she said, pointing to a truck.

&quot;Huh? But... what about Cloud?&quot;

Tifa&#39;s mouth tightened slightly and she looked upwards with an 
aggravated sigh that made Aerith want to giggle. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you later, 
but hurry! Hurry! That means moving your legs at a faster rate, you 
two.&quot;

&quot;Tifa, you&#39;re so mean to him sometimes,&quot; Aerith laughed, getting into 
the passenger side of the three wheeler truck indicated, with the flat 
open back.

She was given that warm grin in return, lighting up the fighters 
normally sullen and sulk inclined features, chasing away any inclination 
to brood sadly, &quot;Yeah well, I know he doesn&#39;t mind and he knows how much 
I care for him.&quot;

Barrett huffed and wheezed, making to try and get in to drive. Tifa 
frowned and slapped his hand off the door, &quot;Huh, Tif&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Oh you don&#39;t... Get in the back, both you and Red.&quot;

&quot;But,&quot; his eyes trammelled to the back, &quot;...but...&quot;

&quot;Just do it. If it gets scary, hug Red. Red, if it gets scary, lookout 
for Barrett hugging you.&quot;

The answer from the burly man was a deep throated grumble and Red lolled 
his tongue out in amusement. Tifa clambered in beside Aerith, looking 
for the keys. Aerith watched her hands move about and then leaned over 
and touched the ignition with her finger, murmuring. A small jolt of 
electricity tingled in her fingertip, then leapt out, starting the 
engine with a vroom sound.

&quot;I&#39;m not bad with electronics either,&quot; she offered quietly, smiling. 
&quot;They&#39;re just not as pretty as plants or flowers.&quot;

&quot;Is there anything you&#39;re not good at?&quot; Tifa laughed.

Aerith looked away, putting a hand to her cheek to feel the raging blush 
but smiled, the truck hurrying on and crashing through a small glass 
panel with a shattering sound. Was that a compliment Tifa had just 
thrown her way? She sounded so natural, so at ease. Just as she was 
starting to wonder where Cloud was, he burst out ahead of them on a 
fascinating specimen of motorbike, all heavy exhaust and tyres, 
screeching along the stairs and through a window.

&quot;Hold on!&quot; Tifa yelled.

&quot;Hold on?&quot; She said in puzzlement, and then shrieked partly with fear, 
partly with adrenaline as the truck made a madcap dash for freedom 
through the same window, landing on the motorway and skidding off, with 
curses from a tumbled about Barrett streaking after them...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

She saw to their wounds with deft hands, touching their skin and healing 
the cuts over with what could only be described as admirable skill. She 
knew she was a talented healer as well as botanist, but seeing the 
relieved smiles on their faces after the fight with a monster of metal 
that had rolled down the highway after them in a furious roar of fire 
and blood. She felt much better knowing she could take care of them, 
eyes glancing now and then to the slag heap of molten metal, all that 
was left of it.

Once they were patched together, the five of them stood looking at one 
another, taking in their faces.

Barrett looked tired but still in good spirits, his dark skin not 
showing any dirt but the rip in his trousers would need to be sewn as it 
was at an amusing place (the seam on his backside) and a makeshift half 
cloak had dealt with any uneasiness concerning who might see his 
underwear.

Red too, seemed okay, if bewildered about his surroundings. She can&#39;t 
say she didn&#39;t blame him. She had no memory of anything outside the 
slums and the ShinRa labs, so this was all wildly new and exciting to 
her too. But his body was badly scarred; she wanted to desperately ask 
him how he&#39;d received such wounds and why they were left so untreated.

Cloud was taciturn as usual, his blue eyes distant and a hand placed 
under his chin in thought. His clothing had come out largely unscathed, 
but the scabbard straps for his enormous sword had been sliced clean 
through and would need a good leather-smith to put them back together.

Tifa stood to the side, looking at the city with a pensive expression on 
her beautiful face. A thousand worried seemed to cloud about her strong 
features, from her strong straight nose to the pointed chin and dark 
eyes that hid more mysteries than Aerith could readily guess at.

These were her friends.

This was a destiny that had chosen her, that had chosen them. Was it her 
destiny to gather these people and take them along with her, to see the 
world? To see more than the world: to see underneath it and then, 
underneath that?

&quot;Well,&quot; Barrett broke the silence, &quot;What do we do now?&quot;

&quot;Sephiroth is alive, I have to...&quot; the Soldier tightened his jaw, &quot;I 
have to settle the score.&quot;

&quot;And that&#39;ll save the Planet?&quot;

&quot;...seems like it.&quot;

Aerith moved and smiled as Barrett held up his arm, &quot;Awright, I&#39;m 
going.&quot;

She moved to the edge of the highway. It had been left off during 
construction so bits of it hung jagged out into the forever beyond them, 
into the world. She folded her arms and said in her quiet voice that 
seemed to always grab anyone&#39;s attention, &quot;I&#39;ll go too. I have things I 
want to find out.&quot;

&quot;About the Ancients?&quot; His voice warred between curious and worried. She 
knew why.

&quot;...many things,&quot; was all she could say.

&quot;I guess, this is goodbye Midgar,&quot; Tifa said, looking away from the 
sprawling city of inequity to them, eyes bright. Aerith said nothing; 
she knew Tifa would be happy to be away from this place.

In her own heart of hearts, she could hardly credit that she too was 
leaving finally, after years of dreaming that she would. The world, so 
vast, so new to her, it opened up with possibilities and dreams. She 
shivered and drew her red jacket closer to her shoulders.

They started for the wire leading down to the outskirts of the Midgar. 
The going down was less than easy for her; she had to blushingly 
admonish them to not look up, or even peek, something which made Tifa 
laugh helplessly &#150; so much so, she lost her grip and fell four feet to 
land on her ass, still laughing. Eventually, after many pauses to try 
and grip her skirt down, Aerith made it alongside everyone else, staring 
out into the countryside.

She then realised, she didn&#39;t have a damn clue about the geography of 
this place.

...No chance there&#39;s signposts?

&quot;Then, let&#39;s go!&quot; Cloud announced, stepping ahead of them with a gesture 
at the horizon. Aerith held her hands together awkwardly, hoping someone 
actually knew where they were going, or better yet, how to get there.

&quot;We need a group leader for our journey,&quot; The burly terrorist advised 
and then preened his short trimmed beard and grinned rakishly. &quot;Of 
course, only me could be the leader.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Tifa folded her arms beneath her chest, &quot;You think so?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Aeris said quietly, &quot;It would have to be Cloud.&quot;

Barrett muttered, &quot;Damn you all then. Go northeast to a town called 
Kalm. If something happens, we&#39;ll meet up there. &#145;Sides, be dangerous 
having five people jus&#39; strolling around the countryside. Split us into 
two parties.&quot;

&quot;Okay... well I choose...&quot;

&quot;Tifa and I will be fine together, you boys have fun,&quot; Aerith 
interjected.

&quot;...er...well...&quot; Cloud stared at her and she felt her cheeks blushing, 
&quot;I wanted to... you...&quot;

Tifa looked angry, &quot;Are you trying to say I can&#39;t protect her!&quot;

&quot;No! I mean... it&#39;s just...&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll be fine Cloud. Trust me,&quot; she turned her smile on him, so 
energetic and open that he almost smiled back. She could feel Tifa give 
a start in shock, but she didn&#39;t take her eyes from Cloud, who finally 
and reluctantly nodded. &quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;Alright... let&#39;s go.&quot;

The boys all started off and Tifa turned to her. She twisted her hands 
together and looked up shyly at the taller girl. &quot;What,&quot; Tifa 
questioned, &quot;Was that?&quot;

&quot;I just wanted to spend some time with you. Don&#39;t be mad.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not, just a little taken aback. Cloud...&quot; Those dark eyes filled 
with seven emotions, all warring for supremacy until Tifa looked away 
with a half smile, &quot;It&#39;s been ages since I&#39;ve seen him smile. Thanks for 
that.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

Together they started walking, feeling the grass tickle and the sun 
shining down once they moved far enough away from Midgar. They talked, 
about flowers, about their likes and dislikes, about favourites in 
colour, music, clothes, books and even food. They talked about 
practically everything together, enjoying the companionship and soon, 
without either of them realising, sunset came.

Tifa, trained in the ways of the wilderness, set up a camp for them with 
a makeshift tent, saying that they&#39;d buy some proper supplies from Kalm. 
Aerith made a supper from plants and roots she knew were safe to eat. 
Then with their stomachs full, they fell asleep.

Or Tifa did.

Aerith stayed awake and watched the stars overhead. She&#39;d always 
wondered if stars looked like this, beautiful and distant. Her eyes 
moved to take in the profile of Tifa, eyes closed and her cheek resting 
on a hand, a childhood habit that was difficult to break, the other hand 
outstretched and lax, fingers splayed slightly. She moved her own hand 
to take that, curling her fingers together with Tifa&#39;s and smiled as the 
other girl tightened her gip.

Then she finally slept.
