fanfiction by <a href="../authors/spiralingfaith.html">Spiraling Faith</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff7/spiralfaith2-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Spin and Ambers:

	&#147;ow, ow, ow!&#148;  Spin screams grabbing Amber and pushing
her away.

	&#147;Oh, Spin, I&#146;m sorry, please forgive me!&#148;  Pleads Amber.

	&#147;Hey, it was my fault, you are right, no sex.&#148;	She sighs
very loudly, &#147;good thing I didn&#146;t start to hurt right in the middle,&#148;
she smirks, &#147; you never stop once your&#146; having fun.&#148;  Amber
blushes and looks down.  &#147;Heh, did I embarrass you?&#148;

	&#147;Spin!&#148;

On top of an Apartment building (8 stories):

	&#147;Kerek stop&#148; yells Tifa from the door.	Kerek had called
her and told her what he was planning to do.  He was planning to
kill himself by jumping from the building.  If he dies the boy
should wake up, and the big pink ball should be destroyed, case
closed.  &#147;Suicide is not the way.&#148;

	Kerek looks back, his gaze warm and inviting, &#147;It&#146;s me
Zero.&#148;

	&#147;Good then you&#146;ll listen,&#148; Tifa sighs, having a great
burden removed from her shoulders.

	&#147;No, I must do this.&#148;  He runs to face the outside world.  &#147;I
don&#146;t know what the &#145;Spiral&#146; is, but it is evil, and will only go
away if I go away.&#148;

	&#147;What &#145;Spiral&#146;?  Tifa ask, taking a few steps towards him.

The way home:

	Yuffie walked happily, completely oblivious to her lover&#146;s
impossible task.  She acts as if the world is shining upon her,
which in a way it was.	Her day was flawless.  She had fun at
school (like she always did the first day).  She got to meet up with
her old friends, and with new teacher (at least new to her).  No
argument, just a nice calm, and fun day.

	She walks threw the crowded streets, unknowing to her
stalkers.  They are in close pursuit, and are ready for the purpose
to be realized.

	As she rounds a corner, two hands reach out and grasping
(one covering her mouth, the other taking one of her arms) and
pulls her into the alleyway.  &#147;Shut up and you won&#146;t get hurt, to
much.&#148;	Her kidnapper&#146;s voice is deep, and masculine.  Two of
his friends enter and puts tape over her mouth.  After tying up her
legs and arms they remove her school uniform before&#133;

Back on the roof:

	&#145;Spiral&#146;.  A large rose-colored orb that floats high above
the Nippon.  Consist of pure evil, and brought to life by Zero&#146;s
existence in Edenina.  The only way, it seems, to get rid of it is for
Zero to die.  He decides that if no one will kill him that means he
will have to take his own life.  But he shouldn&#146;t, or that is what
Tifa says.

	&#147;Zero, there has to be another way.&#148;

	&#147;No, there isn&#146;t any other way,&#148; he screams, turning to
look at who he is addressing.  &#147;Think about it, I came here when
the boy collapsed, that means in theory, if He comes back, I
disappear!&#148;  &#147;It&#146;s in evitable.&#148;   He turns around and steps onto the
side.

	&#147;Zero!&#148;

He leaps off.  The wind caresses his body as he closes his
eyes, waiting for his death to take him away.	He feels almost at
peace as his dream body plummets towards the ground.
Everything about it made him feel at peace.  The wind, the smell,
it made him worriless.	Fate will soon take its toll on him.  But
now he felt at ease.  &#147;It is painless,&#148; he thinks to himself before
something hard hits him.  A surge of pain course threw him before
he collapses into the darkness.

	&#147;NO!&#148;

&#147;We called it Sin&#148;- Auron FFX



Authors Notes-

	Why? OH, why did he have to die?!  Never mind that I
have more to talk about.  Right now I am watching TV, yeah.
What you might be asking.  Boy Meets World.  Great show,
amazing (really).  Reminds me of me.  Only, I am fat and useless,
and more than likely going to fail in life (kidding).  Any way, I
really am fat, which makes gym hell on my.  Not to mention my
gym has no air conditioning and it&#146;s around 100 degrees every
day.  Oyeee.  Man, being in school sucks, and it just started.	I am
missin&#146; my anime now.  More to my point though; I am having
fun with the Authors note, and I am almost done wid em.  So read
my other stories.
