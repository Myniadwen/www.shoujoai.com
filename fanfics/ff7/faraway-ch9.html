<h1>Far Away to Eternity (part 9 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff7/faraway-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>There was blood everywhere. 

The walls of the Battle Square were covered in blood, the floors 
decorated in splatters of it. Bodies, some piled on one another, were 
prone, riddled with bullet holes. One woman stared up at Tifa with 
vacant eyes, clouded with death, and she shuddered, moving closer to 
Aeris. She glanced around the room, noticing an odd, overstuffed Mog 
with a cat jockey. She moved toward it, tapped the giant pink plush Mog 
cautiously, and was startled when the cat bowed to her. 

&quot;Cait Sith&#39;s the name,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Who are you?&quot; 

&quot;Tifa...&quot; she blinked in surprise and motioned to Aeris, &quot;And this is 
Aeris.&quot; 

&quot;Nice to meet you...though the circumstances are pretty bad right now.&quot; 
He winced and held his head. 

Cloud walked around, checking bodies. The rest of the group was silent, 
solemn. Barret was nowhere to be found, and Tifa felt a sick, twisting 
feeling form in her stomach. At one of the desks in the room, a clerk 
groaned, moved slightly. Cloud was there immediately. 

&quot;Hey, what happened?!&quot; 

&quot;A...man with a gun...on his arm...&quot; the clerk slumped, went still. 
Cloud ran his hand over his face, stared at the others with worried 
eyes. 

&quot;A gun on his arm?!&quot; Tifa cried in shock. She saw the look on Cloud&#39;s 
face, and shook her head. Barret wasn&#39;t capable of this...he would never 
do such a thing... 

The group turned at the sound of running. The owner of the Gold Saucer, 
Dio, burst in, flanked by guards. Dio was a massive, strong man, but 
even he seemed shaken by the scene in front of him. 

&quot;Did you guys do this!?&quot; Cloud stammered a reply. 

&quot;N...no, it wasn&#39;t us!&quot; 

Cait Sith took a step back; the girls followed his example. 

&quot;Hurry and run, it&#39;s gonna get ugly,&quot; he took off as fast as his Mog 
carrier could take him, and the others followed after him. Cait Sith 
skidded into the arena first, followed by the rest of the group, and 
Dio. 

&quot;That&#39;s as far as you go,&quot; Dio said. Cloud frowned in frustration. 

&quot;Wait, listen to...&quot; he didn&#39;t get to finish his sentence however. 
Security robots made their way into the arena, and quickly cornered the 
small group. 

&quot;Cloud...&quot; Cait Sith said uneasily. Yuffie whimpered, and Tifa clenched 
her teeth. There was no way they were going to make it out of here. One 
of them grabbed Cloud, and he struggled in vain. Tifa, Aeris, Cait Sith 
and Yuffie were quickly grabbed by the robots, and Red XIII roared in 
outrage as one gripped him roughly by the scruff of his neck. 

&quot;Take them to the gateway to heaven!&quot; Dio barked. Tifa had no idea what 
that was, but she had a feeling it had nothing to do with heaven. 

------------------------------ 

The &#39;gateway to heaven&#39; turned out to be the entrance to North Corel&#39;s 
underground prison. When Tifa awoke, she was greeted by a wide expanse 
of desert, with abandoned homes and buildings scattered everywhere. This 
place also had its share of scrap metal, and the sun glinted weakly 
against it as Tifa stood up, spitting sand out of her mouth, and trying 
in vain to pull particles of it out of her hair. She brought her hand to 
her face to block the sun from her eyes, and glanced around. Nothing but 
yellow sand for miles. 

&quot;Wait...&quot; she murmured to herself. &quot;Where is everyone?&quot; She stumbled 
forward a few steps. &quot;Cloud! Barret! Red! Yuffie! Cait Sith! Aeris! 
Where are you?!&quot; 

&quot;Geez! Would you quit screaming? I hear you, okay? Quit freaking out!&quot; 
Tifa turned at the sound of the voice. 

&quot;Yuffie?&quot; The girl in question sat on the ground a little ways away from 
Tifa, shaking sand out of her shoes. 

&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s me.&quot; Tifa sighed in relief. 

&quot;Where is everyone else?&quot; Yuffie glanced back and forth quickly. 

&quot;I uh...I don&#39;t know. I just remember that stupid robot thing grabbing 
me and ending up here.&quot; She pulled her shoes on and started to punch at 
the air. &quot;Ahh man, if that thing hadn&#39;t been so big...then booyaka! I 
would have kicked its butt!&quot; 

&quot;Really. Is that why you passed out right after it grabbed you?&quot; A voice 
said. Yuffie&#39;s punches stopped, and Tifa brightened visibly when she saw 
who it was. 

&quot;Red!&quot; The lion creature gave her a mock bow. 

&quot;Nice to see you Tifa. Do you know where everyone is?&quot; 

&quot;I...I don&#39;t know.&quot; she kicked at the ground. &quot;Oh no...Cloud, Aeris, 
Barret, Cait too...they might be stuck in that desert...they might be 
lost.&quot; Red XIII shook his head. 

&quot;They&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;m pretty sure they probably landed near us, but they 
woke up from the impact faster. Let&#39;s check some of these houses.&quot; He 
started to walk toward one, then stopped. &quot;And Tifa, Yuffie?&quot; 

&quot;Yes?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, what?&quot; 

Red XIII growled. &quot;Stay close to me, and don&#39;t speak to any of these 
prisoners. I have a feeling they haven&#39;t seen a woman in a looong 
time...&quot; 

Tifa nodded, and then caught a glance of familiar blonde hair in the 
distance, going into a house. 

&quot;Hey! It&#39;s Cloud!&quot; No doubt Aeris would be with him too. She broke into 
a run, leaving the other two behind. Red chuckled. 

&quot;She sure does love him a lot, doesn&#39;t she?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, I guess...&quot; 

&quot;What do you mean, &#39;you guess?&#39; Come on, she loves him, can&#39;t you tell?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m just...welll...look. I spend a lot of time with Tifa...&quot; And Aeris, 
she added mentally. &quot;And well, um...forget it. Nevermind. You&#39;re right; 
she does love him.&quot; She followed Tifa, and Red was left standing in 
confusion. 

&quot;Barret was right...it really is hard to understand a woman&#39;s nature...&quot; 

------------------------------ 

Tifa slipped into the house after Cloud, wincing at the sharp creak the 
door made. Cloud glanced behind him quickly, and sighed in relief when 
he saw Tifa. Tifa smiled, and spared a glance over Cloud&#39;s shoulder. 
Aeris caught her glance, and gave her a smile. 

&#39;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re safe,&#39; she mouthed to Tifa. Tifa blushed. Her head felt 
swimmy for some reason. 

She jumped in shock when she heard Barret enter. She glanced at him and 
instinctively moved closer to Cloud, Aeris, and Cait Sith. The look in 
his eyes was frightening. 

&quot;Didn&#39;t I tell you not to come here?!&quot; He raised his gun-arm and aimed 
it at them. 

&quot;Ju...just hold on for a second!&quot; Cait Sith stammered. &quot;We just want to 
talk! You&#39;ll understand if you just hear us out!&quot; 

Barret shot and the others ducked. Tifa&#39;s heart hammered in her chest, 
and she almost whimpered in relief when the shots stopped. They all 
glanced up when they heard a thump. Barret had shot a prisoner hiding 
behind a ratty old couch. 

&quot;Didn&#39;t want none of ya to get involved...&quot; Barret muttered. 

Yuffie and Red XIII made their way into the house, and Aeris cleared her 
throat. 

&quot;Hey, that&#39;s Cloud&#39;s line! &#39;...It&#39;s too dangerous, I can&#39;t let you get 
involved...&#39; blah, blah, blah...&quot; 

&quot;Yeah. We&#39;re already involved in this. We saw you and hurried here. So 
come on Barret, just tell us what&#39;s going on.&quot; Tifa said. 

&quot;You guys...&quot; Barret murmured. 

&quot;I heard that the murders at the Battle Arena were done by a man with a 
gun-arm...Was that you?&quot; Red XIII asked. Barret shook his head quickly. 

&quot;There&#39;s another...another man that had a gun grafted inta one of his 
arms...it was four years ago...I remember...I was on my way home from 
visiting a Mako Reactor being built.&quot; 

The others sat down as Barret began to explain what had happened. 

&quot;My best friend, Dyne and me, we were headin&#39; back to Corel, when the 
village headman up to us...said Shinra was attacking the village.&quot; He 
clenched his fist. &quot;Some soldiers were following him...They shot him 
down right in front of us. Then, they started to aim at us. We ran, but 
Dyne fell backwards off a cliff...I grabbed him before he fell, but they 
shot at my arm...Dyne&#39;s too, and he fell...From then on, I couldn&#39;t use 
my right arm no more. I was depressed for a while...but then I threw 
away my artificial arm and got this gun grafted in. Got a new right arm 
to get revenge on the Shinra, who took everything away...&quot; 

&quot;Oh...that sucks,&quot; Yuffie whispered to Red. Barret continued his story. 

&quot;Back then, I heard the doc say there was another man who got the same 
operation as me. But, his was the left arm...&quot; 

&quot;But...Dyne&#39;s injury was the same as yours, right?&quot; Aeris asked. 

Tifa nodded. &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s right. He was deceived by the Shinra too. 
He&#39;ll probably join us to fight against the Shinra.&quot; 

Barret shook his head. &quot;...wouldn&#39;t bet on it. I gotta &#39;pologize to Dyne 
before I can rest in peace. An&#39; that&#39;s why, I gotta go alone.&quot; 

Cloud scoffed. &quot;Do whatever you want...is that what you want to hear? 
Well, I can&#39;t let you do it. Because, if you die on me, I&#39;m gonna have 
nightmares.&quot; 

&quot;Barret,&quot; Aeris said, &quot;this isn&#39;t the end. Weren&#39;t you going to save the 
Planet?&quot; 

Barret turned to Tifa. &quot;Shit! Tifa, you oughtta know by now.&quot; 

&quot;...That&#39;s all right.&quot; Tifa whispered. &quot;I&#39;m not so different from you.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s easier to understand.&quot; Aeris said. &quot;It&#39;s you, Barret.&quot; 

Cloud straightened up. &quot;So there it is, Barret. So I guess it&#39;ll be 
Barret, me, and Red.&quot; He gave Tifa a look. &quot;You should...&quot; 

&quot;I know, I know. I should stay here.&quot; 

Aeris frowned as he left. &quot;We could have gone.&quot; Tifa shook her head. 

&quot;No...it&#39;s really Barret&#39;s fight, after all...&quot; She leaned against a 
wall and closed her eyes. &quot;Besides, I&#39;m really hot and tired.&quot; 

Yuffie nodded in agreement. &quot;Yeah, geez! It&#39;s way too hot!&quot; She slumped 
her shoulders. &quot;But it&#39;s gonna be boring just waiting here for Cloud.&quot; 

&quot;Well,&quot; Cait Sith piped up, and the girls turned to him, &quot;I could always 
do fortunes for you lovely ladies.&quot; 

&quot;Fortunes?&quot; Tifa raised an eyebrow. &quot;Well...I guess. Give it your best 
shot.&quot; 

The Mog started to rock back and forth slowly, and a slip of paper came 
out of its mouth. Yuffie grabbed it. 

&quot;Don&#39;t start grass fires...your lucky month is July...&quot; she made a face. 
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; She frowned at the stuffed cat, and he slumped 
his shoulders. 

&quot;Wait, wait! Let me try again.&quot; He rocked back and forth a bit faster 
this time, and Tifa grabbed the slip of paper. 

&quot;Do unto others, and you will be granted golden chocobos...what is 
this?&quot; 

Cait Sith did a very fast dance this time, and Aeris grabbed the paper. 
She read it quietly, and Tifa watched as her face clouded over. 

&quot;You okay?&quot; 

Aeris swallowed hard and nodded, but Tifa didn&#39;t buy it. 

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; She put a hand on her shoulder. &quot;It&#39;s just a silly 
fortune.&quot; She ignored Cait Sith when he stuck his tongue out at her. &quot;It 
doesn&#39;t mean anything...&quot; 

Aeris gave her a strained smile, and turned away. &quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; 

Tifa frowned. &quot;Let me see the fortune.&quot; 

Cait Sith moved to sit next to Yuffie. &quot;Uh oh. I think they&#39;re about to 
start arguing,&quot; he whispered. 

&quot;No. It&#39;s alright; it&#39;s just a fortune, like you said. You don&#39;t need to 
see it.&quot; Aeris responded. She grasped the piece of paper in her hand and 
looked toward the door. &quot;I think we should follow the others.&quot; 

&quot;Let me see the fortune Aeris.&quot; 

&quot;No.&quot; This time her voice was firm. 

&quot;Why are you so scared? It&#39;s just a fortune. You don&#39;t need to hide 
things, Aeris.&quot; Tifa&#39;s voice was gentle. Yuffie coughed and interrupted. 

&quot;Hey. Cut it out Tifa. If she doesn&#39;t want to show us, it&#39;s cool, okay?&quot; 

The gaze Tifa gave her was almost murderous. Yuffie flinched. &quot;I 
mean...what I mean to say is, I just think you should drop it.&quot; 

Tifa glanced over at Aeris. &quot;But...I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She leaned against the 
wall and sighed. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have pried.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s alright...I just...it&#39;s alright.&quot; 

It was quiet for a moment, and then Yuffie coughed awkwardly. &quot;Hey, 
stupid cat thing. Let&#39;s go find Cloud and the others and eavesdrop.&quot; 

Cait Sith bristled. &quot;Don&#39;t call me stupid, kid! But...uh, that is a good 
idea.&quot; He hopped toward the door and opened it for Yuffie. &quot;Ladies 
first, you know.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks. Um. Tifa, Aeris? We&#39;ll be back in a little while. I&#39;d ask you 
guys to join us, but uh, it&#39;s probably easier to travel in a small 
group...geez, I sound like Cloud...but anyway. Yeah. See ya.&quot; 

&quot;Bye Yuffie. And...&quot; Tifa started. 

&quot;...be careful.&quot; Aeris finished. 

Yuffie bit down a laugh. &quot;Yeah, okay. I will.&quot; 

Tifa waited until the door closed behind them to speak. 

&quot;So...&quot; 

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Aeris murmured. 

&quot;We really need to talk about some things.&quot; 

&quot;I know. I think...&quot; 

&quot;Hmm?&quot; 

&quot;Just. I wonder...how do you feel?&quot; 

Tifa blinked. &quot;How do I feel? I feel...strange, I guess. I just...at 
Costa del Sol...&quot; she blushed. &quot;I mean, I&#39;ve been thinking about what 
happened...&quot; 

Aeris giggled. &quot;Really?&quot; 

&quot;Not like that! Well...a little. But more...what will we do?&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;ll just keep moving foward. Nothing has changed.&quot; 

&quot;Everything&#39;s changed Aeris, and you know it.&quot; 

Aeris frowned and shook her head. &quot;You worry too much. Stop worrying; 
everything will be fine in the end.&quot; 

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; 

Aeris looked sad for a moment, but it was gone before Tifa could 
question it. &quot;I&#39;m positive. Just live Tifa. Try not to think so much 
about how you&#39;re going to live, just...be. There&#39;s nothing wrong with 
looking to the sky.&quot; 

Tifa sighed, pulled Aeris into a hug. &quot;You&#39;re very mysterious, do you 
know that?&quot; 

Aeris laughed against Tifa&#39;s neck, a soft, breathy sound. &quot;Why thank 
you, Marianna.&quot; 

Tifa frowned. &quot;I should have never told you that.&quot; 

Aeris smiled, and then yawned, stretched. &quot;I&#39;m tired.&quot; 

&quot;Then get some rest. I&#39;ll wake you when they come back.&quot; 

Aeris did as ordered, leaned her head against Tifa&#39;s shoulder and soon 
drifted off to sleep. When her breathing had softened, Tifa maneuvered 
her arm around her waist and grasped for the tiny slip of paper still 
clasped in her hand....if she could just reach it... 

Then, she shook her head and stopped. It wasn&#39;t worth it. Aeris would 
tell her, in time. 

------------------------------ 

Yuffie and Cait Sith returned first, and Tifa caught the strange, tired 
glance in the girl&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;We found a way out.&quot; Yuffie muttered. &quot;Barret got permission from 
Dyne...&quot; 

&quot;How?&quot; 

Yuffie was silent for a second, and then she spoke softly. &quot;...Dyne 
wanted to fight Barret, you know? Said it was like, his fault everything 
had happened. They fought, Barret won.&quot; She almost looked proud for an 
instant. &quot;And then Dyne started saying stuff about how he was going to 
see his wife again, an&#39; how he shouldn&#39;t be able to hold Marlene...isn&#39;t 
that Barret&#39;s daughter?&quot; 

Tifa nodded. &quot;Yes, but...&quot; 

&quot;Yeah. I guess...I guess Barret adopted her, huh? Because she was Dyne&#39;s 
and...well...anyway. Barret got permission from Dyne to go back to the 
upper levels.&quot; 

&quot;What happened to Dyne?&quot; Aeris murmured sleepily, pulling away from Tifa 
and rubbing her eyes. 

&quot;He uh...he&#39;s just...you know, he&#39;s gone.&quot; She was quiet for a while, 
and Tifa got the hint. 

&quot;I see...so um...is Barret okay?&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t know...geez. This sucks. But, I mean, at least we&#39;re leaving, 
right? There&#39;s a condition though.&quot; 

&quot;What do we have to do?&quot; 

&quot;Well, it&#39;s more like what Cloud has to do. He&#39;s gotta win a Chocobo 
race for us to get out of here. He didn&#39;t look too happy, but man, 
neither would I. Chocobo riding makes me sick to my stomach.&quot; 

&quot;Can we watch the race?&quot; Aeris asked. 

&quot;Yeah, I think.&quot; Yuffie stood up and brushed sand off her shorts. &quot;Come 
on.&quot; 

------------------------------ 

Cloud looked a little awkward on the chocobo, but he quickly gained his 
bearings. Tifa thought he looked a little queasy, and frowned in worry. 

&quot;You think he&#39;s okay?&quot; she whispered to Aeris. Aeris nodded. 

&quot;The race won&#39;t be that long. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll win.&quot; She cupped her hands 
around her mouth. &quot;Go Cloud!&quot; 

Cloud gave her a shaky grin and righted himself on the bird. He glanced 
up at the timer. 

&quot;3...2...1...&quot; he whispered. A shot went off, and the chocobos tore down 
the racing path, chirping excitedly. Cloud looked as if he would fall 
off for a second, but he caught on quickly, soon gaining the lead. 
Everyone, even Barret cheered for him, and he grinned triumphantly as 
his chocobo passed the finish line first. 

He hopped off of the bird, and the group ran to him. Barret clapped him 
soundly on the back. 

&quot;Alright man! You did it!&quot; 

Cloud nodded. &quot;Guess I did, huh? Wow...that was...a rush.&quot; He 
straightened up. &quot;Alright everyone, let&#39;s get out of this place.&quot; 

------------------------------ 

Tifa, Aeris, Cait Sith, Barret, Red and Yuffie sat in the lobby of the 
Gold Saucer, waiting for Cloud to finish up. Dio strutted over to them. 

&quot;Hey there, girl,&quot; he said to Aeris. 

&quot;Um...pardon me?&quot; 

He threw her a set of keys. &quot;Tell that boy of yours this is a gift for 
the um, mix up back there.&quot; 

&quot;What is it?&quot; Yuffie asked. 

&quot;It&#39;s a buggy, girl! It&#39;ll take you around places. Tell that boy he did 
a good job. And good luck on your journey.&quot; He gave them a look. &quot;Visit 
again, alright? I promise we won&#39;t have any problems.&quot; When he left, 
Aeris grabbed the PHS from Barret. 

&quot;Hey!&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m calling Cloud! He&#39;ll be so excited.&quot; 

&quot;Whatever,&quot; Yuffie said. &quot;Um hey, can I drive?&quot; 

&quot;No.&quot; Everyone said at once. Yuffie kicked at the ground. 

&quot;Mega bummer.&quot; 

------------------------------ 

&quot;So everyone,&quot; Cloud said when they had all joined up again. &quot;We&#39;re 
heading to Gongaga. Dio gave me a letter saying Sephiroth was seen 
around there.&quot; He hopped into the driver&#39;s seat of the buggy, and the 
others clamored in after him. 

&quot;I get shotgun!&quot; Yuffie said, scrambling in the seat next to Cloud. 

&quot;Right.&quot; Cloud muttered. &quot;Um, so yeah. Buckle up everyone.&quot; 

&quot;Yo, you betta not crash this thing,&quot; Barret warned. Cloud grinned 
sardonically, shaking his head. 

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll be real careful.&quot; He started the buggy up. &quot;Okay everyone, 
let&#39;s mosey.&quot; 

The entire group burst into laughter, and he frowned. That&#39;s the thanks 
he got for being optimistic... 

------------------------------ 

end of chapter eight 

Man. That was a long chapter, and no Cosmo Canyon. Oh well. I apologize 
if things were a little choppy, or if they dragged out too much. I was 
trying to make this chapter a little long. Next time: Gongaga, Turks, 
old boyfriends and Cosmo Canyon. See you around.
