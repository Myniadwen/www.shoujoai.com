So come on God,
Here I am...
Can you hear me?
Can you save me?

- Halo -

-------------------------

It was vast.

The monolith of bricks and mortar, held together by wisps of ivy that 
had long since permeated the ancient stones. Shrub which had been dense 
with the tendrils of forest that huddled close to the temple had instead 
been pushed back, as if the very temple wished to try and remain apart 
from all being, all life.

She had lived underneath the shadows of the Nibelheim Mountains and 
traversed their awe inspiring and breathtaking heights in her youth, 
never once intimidated by them. She had lived in the squalor and 
splendour that was the high rise world of Midgar, even where the slums 
could see the spiralling heights that marked their little world, stuffed 
under and below it, forgotten or attempted to be forgotten. She had 
flown and crashed, and almost died in the process and was chasing a 
homicidal lunatic half way around the world because she really had 
nothing better to do and she had happened to fall in love along the way 
with one of those unlucky enough to have their fate tied closely to that 
of said lunatic.

But standing here, she felt the breath pause in her throat and try to 
crawl all the way back down into her lungs, to nestle with her 
fluttering height and burning feelings, the pit of her passionate soul. 
The temple wasn&#39;t large to look at, nor was it anything other than 
slightly dilapidated from lack of care lavished on it with the waning of 
the Cetra race, but about it lingered something. Like old magic, worn 
heavily into the bones of a creature that refused to pass into the next 
life, hanging on for the last Ancient left alive, as a bridge to the 
world she would otherwise never know.

Thoughts acting as a summons, the Ancient stepped forward and then 
paused at the front of their small group of three investigating the 
temple remains for hints about Sephiroth and whatever it was he sought 
here.

Her eyes were pools of viridian life, glowing with something unspoken 
and uncharacteristically, not a single smile touched those perfect lips, 
pursed on the fractional leap of a thought or a word. Instead, she held 
herself straight and then slowly tilted her head back and cocked it to 
the left as if listening to someone or something very intently.

This was Aerith&#39;s strangest talent of all those amazing skills she 
possessed, from a healing touch or the power over plant life that 
astounded all the others; the power to listen to the Planet&#39;s voice, the 
very Planet which lived under their feet.

Almost ages ago now, to her it seemed, Bugenhagen had explained to Cloud 
and Barrett about the voice of the Planet, how he had created a machine 
which mimicked in a crude fashion, their unique ability to hear the 
Planet speak. The Cetra machine, as he sort of nicknamed it, was 
designed to allow humans to hear the pain that they put it through each 
day.

Tifa sometimes wondered what it was like, to endure such an agony as 
knowing that a dear friend you had been close to all your life (as the 
Planet must be to the Ancient) grows sickly with each passing day, a 
sickness your healing would not reach alone. It was this thought that 
often made Tifa ponder on the fact that Aerith was looking desperately 
in the hope that she wasn&#39;t alone, that someone could help her foster 
the talents to help the Planet grow whole again.

She isn&#39;t alone though, I might not always understand her, nor be as 
gifted in such skills and magic as she is, but I want to be of some use, 
I want to help her help this world. I&#39;d do anything to help her achieve 
those goals.

She smiled as Aerith opened her eyes, expelling a breath of air in a 
deep and weary sigh. Then she fell to her knees, clutching at her temple 
and murmured, &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Aerith!&quot; Both she and Cloud said at the same time. He glanced at her, 
as if grateful that she would think of the flower girl.

Her barely restrained look that promised death by some cliff throwing 
episode of madness was a mite frosty. He didn&#39;t notice, as he usually 
tended to blank most things out emotionally. She sighed inwardly.

Yet another thorn in her foot on the bracken filled path she walked: 
Cloud Strife. She wasn&#39;t sure how to approach him about this at all, 
before her jealousy got the upper hand and she ended up hurting him for 
no good reason at all. She knew without question that he loved the 
strange Ancient as much as she did, well... probably not as much, she 
conceded with a small smile. But the problem lay in the fact that she 
was unsure what his reaction would be to any confession of feelings for 
Aerith on her part, of boasting that she held hands and kissed her, that 
she stole her breath and woke every morning to see her smiling. What a 
boast that would be... but would it break his heart?

So like always, she said nothing and just revelled in her delicious 
little secret, enjoyed the closeness of the girl whose hand she found 
first, who she helped up and who she held onto as she wavered helplessly 
in the after effect of the Planet&#39;s call.

&quot;It was so loud, almost a shout,&quot; Aerith whispered.&quot;

&quot;Did it say anything about Sephiroth?&quot; Cloud demanded and Tifa was had 
put not to scowl - back to business in a flash, as per usual for the 
blond.

&quot;No, but it seemed happy to have me here. It&#39;s like it&#39;s been waiting 
ever so long.&quot; She looked distant, &quot;Such a long, long time to have 
anyone who speaks to it.&quot;

&quot;But there was no mention of Sephiroth?&quot;

&quot;It didn&#39;t say either way, Cloud, I&#39;m sorry. But...&quot;

&quot;But?&quot;

&quot;It feels uneasy, that much is clear.&quot; Aerith&#39;s face looked a little 
pale from exertion and she folded gently to Tifa&#39;s side with a willing 
motion, hands dropping to secretly brush against hers. Tifa blushed then 
looked to the side, trying to cover it with a cough and then as 
something caught her eye, she pointed in alarm.

&quot;Look!&quot;

Crumpling on the upper most step of the temple was a figure in black, 
hooded and shaking much like those they had encountered in Nibelheim, 
muttering about some reunion, about Sephiroth and humming to their 
selves in the creepiest way imaginable. Cloud narrowed his eyes and set 
off first. Aerith made to follow but Tifa tightened her very lax grip on 
the slender hand of the Ancient, shaking her head and putting herself in 
front.

&quot;I&#39;ll go first, just in case.&quot;

Aerith giggled into a hand, &quot;Playing hero again?&quot;

&quot;Always,&quot; she flashed a cocky grin that bubbled with good humour, and 
with a toss of her head, she paraded after Cloud, hearing the sweet 
laughter behind her. Tifa would make such an idiot from herself, just to 
have that laughter and smile rankle the ether. What a strange thing love 
was.

She ascended the steps in three or four easy bounds, coming to a stop by 
Cloud who was, by now, holding only the ragged remains of what had once 
been the black cloak for the figure, wisps of it&#39;s being still fading 
and disintegrating into the air. The horrible smell of sulphur lingered 
and instinctively she covered her mouth against backbite of rotten eggs 
that characterised the alchemical element.

&quot;He vanished. He said he was inside...&quot; Cloud muttered angrily, tossing 
the cloak down. &quot;Tifa, we can&#39;t take her in there.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t we? Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s for her to decide - besides, we&#39;re 
here to protect her, aren&#39;t we? And this place,&quot; She gestured at it, 
&quot;It&#39;s an -Ancient- temple. Unless you got a degree in Cetra when none of 
us were looking, she has to go in. She&#39;s Cetra to her toes, and you know 
it.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t like the idea of it though, he&#39;s just in there, he&#39;s...&quot;

&quot;A homicidal maniac, yes, true.&quot; Tifa put her hands on her hips, noting 
how Aerith had to keep pausing to pull her skirt to her knees just to 
get up the steps, &quot;But you can&#39;t cotton wool someone like her. She&#39;ll 
try and escape even harder.&quot;

&quot;Tifa.&quot;

&quot;Cloud,&quot; she retorted.

His expression turned sullen and she knew she was scowling at him, 
feeling prickled by every word coming from his mouth. She knew excatly 
how he felt, she really and honestly did, but knowing Aerith as 
intimately as she did now after months of travelling by her side, she 
also knew that it was impossible to try and cage that bird from freedom.

Aerith passed them whilst they were locked in staring, murmuring, &quot;I can 
hear someone in pain...&quot;

&quot;Pain?&quot; Tifa said, taking her eyes from Cloud&#39;s and breaking the 
deadlock, &quot;Who, what, where?&quot;

&quot;Aerith... gah!&quot;

Cloud vaulted inside after her, trying to get in front whilst Tifa took 
her time to scuff the scrap of a cloak from the top of the temple, a 
ragged remnant of some dirty trick and evil lie that really didn&#39;t 
belong on such sacred ground. It fluttered and flared into ghastly, 
wraith-like life then faded away, into the woods. She watched it for a 
moment, and then tightening her jaw she turned and followed Cloud and 
the silent-footed Aerith inside, arms folded underneath her ample bosom.

Inside there was a pool of very sticky blood and someone seated in the 
centre of it, head bowed and jerking every now and then, as if pained 
them to breathe. She looked to Aerith, seeing her white face, hands 
pressed to her mouth in shock and tears made from diamonds standing in 
emerald eyes. Then she looked to Cloud, who wore an expression caught 
between horrors and &#39;you got your comeuppance&#39;.

The figure gave a wet gasp, the wet tear of someone who has an internal 
wound and she winced, then blinked as the figure raised its head: Tseng, 
the director of the Turk subsection in ShinRa employ. He had managed to 
remain, despite the dust of the inside of the temple, marginally clean, 
bar the blood and gaping wound in the right side of his chest. In one 
bloody, curled up hand, he held the keystone, a twisted, glowing green 
thing that pulsated with life. His eyes passed from her to Cloud, 
inscrutably dark, then to Aerith where the vaguest hint of emotion 
seeped through.

&quot;Aerith,&quot; he gasped, tears welling in his eyes, &quot;I didn&#39;t want you to 
see this.&quot;

&quot;T-Tseng,&quot; she wailed breathlessly, then hurried off and turned her 
back, hands moving from her mouth to cover her face. &quot;Tseng, why?&quot;

&quot;I came here to try an... and open the temple of the A... Ancients,&quot; he 
laboured, clutching the wound but his eyes never leaving the back of the 
Ancient. Tifa felt a wrench of pity. How strange - she never imagined 
she would feel pity for him. &quot;I was following orders...&quot;

&quot;Sephiroth?&quot; Cloud once again barked, as if giving orders.

The dark eyes of the Turk swept briefly to his face, a taut sneer 
happening to curl the corners of his lips, then they too relaxed 
tiredly, &quot;He&#39;s inside, he gave me this wound.&quot;

&quot;The keystone?&quot;

&quot;Take it,&quot; Tseng tossed it feebly so it clattered uselessly on the 
floor. &quot;I&#39;m not going to need it anyway.&quot; Then he struggled to try and 
rise up with Aerith watching from the corner of her eye, horror written 
over her pale face. Cloud made not one single move to try and help him, 
stone faced as he retrieved the keystone.

But the terrible horror in the green eyes of her love was what moved her 
to action. She crossed the distance between herself and the Turk 
quickly; some small part of her distressed at what she was doing, 
screaming at her to use common sense: these were the enemy! But Aerith&#39;s 
kind eyes didn&#39;t see that... so she grasped him by the arm and with a 
heave, helped to move Tseng away from the pattern decorated altar and to 
a corner. When he relaxed, she peered into his eyes, and he into hers. 
There was no hint of animosity, only tiredness.

She knew then, he was worth her pity, he was worth whatever scraps of 
compassion she had left for the human race on the whole. Stuck between 
everything in his life, she could see it in that moment, a look she knew 
was mirrored on her face and with it, came crashing understanding to 
both of them. Secretly, so Cloud couldn&#39;t see as he was busy inspecting 
the murals and the keystone to try and open the passage to the Temple, 
she slipped him a vial of medicinal potion; to help heal the wound a 
little, stem some of his bleeding.

His expression changed not once as he took it, but the dark eyes 
crinkled briefly with what would have been a smile.

Aerith was still trying to stop her weeping, so leaving Tseng to try and 
administer first aid to his self - pity after all, only ran so far - she 
came to stand, back to back with the Ancient. &quot;Hey.&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; there came the snuffled reply.

&quot;You crying?&quot;

&quot;Just a little.&quot; There was a soft sob, caught close to a strangled 
laugh, &quot;I grew up with Tseng... he&#39;s someone who really knows me... 
there&#39;s probably only a handful of people in the world who can say that. 
It&#39;s just sad, you know.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tifa looked over her shoulder, passing her the handkerchief she 
kept for situations of cleaning or the rare weeping fit, &quot;Don&#39;t cry, 
Aerith.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m trying not to; I look awful when I cry!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care - I think you&#39;re beautiful no matter what.&quot;

&quot;T-Teef...&quot;

There was a click and a green glow flooded the area under their feet, 
highlighting the columns and the thick, rough hewn walls where crude 
symbols were carved. Tifa blinked and even the Ancient who was wiping 
her eyes, turned to see the source of the brilliant effusion of light, 
which happened to be Cloud who had finally fitted the Keystone into 
place. Another click echoed in the room and the blond turned to wave 
gently, &quot;I think it&#39;s a lift mechanism of a sort.&quot;

&quot;Then, we&#39;d best get on,&quot; Tifa took Aerith&#39;s hand, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Tseng 
will be fine.&quot;

And Aerith, all knowing, all loving, smiled and said, &quot;I know, thanks to 
you.&quot;

------------------------------

The temple inside was deceptive, betraying the somewhat small in 
comparison outer front it presented to the world. A whole world and ruin 
created from marble arches, twisting stairs and steps and interlocking 
puzzles that ran without end or seam from one to the other. It confused 
the eye and the mind. The lift had left them on the precipice of a ledge 
and from there; she had spotted the fellow in purple, quite rotund but 
oozing spiritual energy that made the hairs on her arms and back of her 
neck stand to attention. With a pointed finger, she suggested delicately 
that they follow him to the room where he tried to hide himself away. 
Whilst caught in the process of climbing clinging Rockroot Ivy to an 
upper level, she turned over the thoughts bubbling away to themselves.

Tseng&#39;s appearance. Sephiroth&#39;s numerous heinous acts which only seemed 
to add shadow to a lightless character. ShinRa&#39;s involvement. The spy, 
Cait Sith. Her dark dreams. Cloud and Tifa. In the end it always came 
back to those two; already they had woven themselves into her life so 
completely that she found herself unable to extricate either one from 
it. Cloud: the boy who hid from the world. And Tifa: the girl who 
shunned it. Both broken but broken in completely different ways.

She and Tifa hadn&#39;t exactly spoken about the date at the Gold Saucer, 
but she knew that one day, Tifa would see the wisdom in her choices, 
even if for now they seemed to be about as a clear as mud. Tifa had 
become a little less possessive, perhaps trying to ease that fear of 
someone else stealing her away. She&#39;d even told her about the play, 
where upon she had laughed until her socks should shoot from her feet 
with the force of merriment. But seeing Tifa smile was enough to soothe 
the worry in her troubled soul. If Tifa could understand, then 
everything would come right, somehow, she believed that.

At the ledge, interrupting her thoughts, they continue into the small 
craggy room where the purple robed man had vanished, and once inside the 
air seemed significantly cooler and there was a humming sound that 
hovered on the edge of delicious, echoing in her ears. She knew neither 
of her friends could hear it, but it hung so delicately on her inner ear 
that sometimes she would have sworn it was closer to a sigh. Careful not 
to frighten the poor being, Aerith approached him and almost all at 
once, heard a jumble of words and pictures, feelings.

Child.

There was an image of how the creature must view her, and to her shock 
it was nothing like the girl who often pulled sleepy eyed faces at her 
in the mirror of a morning. Instead she was beautiful, radiant even, 
vibrant with the energy of a world that depended on her; flushed cheeks 
and excited eyes.

Danger. Great Danger, Flee.

Now the image in her mind was replaced with that of a man in shadows, 
striding down hallways she didn&#39;t recognise yet at some deep seated 
genetic level, it roused incredible fear inside her. She suddenly felt 
like screaming, tearing at her hair and howling, weeping even in utter 
panic at this terrible image.

Below.

And she understood.

She opened her eyes and smiled, mopping her brow with a discreet wave of 
her hand and plastering a smile on her mouth; &quot;He says we have to go 
down if we want to find Sephiroth.&quot;

&quot;What is he?&quot;

&quot;Once he was a carer in this Temple. Over time, without people to speak 
to, the Ancient&#39;s guarding here probably lost the ability to speak with 
humans. It&#39;s a mixture of feelings and images, all at once and hard to 
sort through. I understand him, almost, though.&quot; She looked to the door, 
&quot;But we still have a way to go. He&#39;s very frightened.&quot;

Tifa said nothing, looking at Cloud. Cloud stared at the man for a long 
moment, then locked eyes with Aerith, as if he was asking her if such 
information were good enough to act upon. She nodded and then he 
gestured to the door. As a unit, they followed.

The journey to find the entrance to the lower parts of the temple was 
just as bad. They managed to find it eventually, but it was well hidden 
under a marble arch, tricking the eye with the winding corridors and 
stairs that littered the particular area, sometimes even those stairs 
going nowhere at all but a useless dead end.

She pressed close to Tifa as they entered to a loud thumping noise, 
another figure in purple running away ahead of them. The thumping noise 
was not erratic, often echoed with a grating noise. For the longest time 
she wondered if she were hearing things, phantasms in her mind, but then 
a boulder roughly the size of a truck came bolting past and she grabbed 
Tifa&#39;s hand in alarm, realising with a jolt of amusement, that Tifa 
grabbed back just as hard. Cloud stared, ashen faced.

&quot;You have got to be kidding me.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t give up,&quot; she said in a voice that was underpinned by her iron 
resolve. They had to get through here, the answer to why Sephiroth was 
here, it was so close!

So saying, she hurried ahead, ducking into the side of the wall as 
quickly as possible. With shouts of alarm, she realised the others were 
following, with varying degrees of success as they pressed into divots 
in the walls to avoid being flattened completely by the rolling 
boulders. At one point, her foot wasn&#39;t so quick to escape and the 
stabbing pain coupled with a crunching sensation told her that something 
had broken in her foot. With a dive out of the other side, she came to 
rest at the feet of the purple robed fellow. Cloud followed almost a 
half second later, crashing down beside her and holding his middle, 
breathing like a labourer. Tifa took two minutes more, but perfect as 
always in any physical challenge, not a single hair seemed to be out of 
place.

That&#39;s my Tifa.

Aerith smiled then gripped her head as another wave of terror flooded 
her.

It called her, she came to conclude, with the boulders stopping now - it 
called her back down the hall and so doing, she got to her feet as Tifa 
was prodding the prostrate Cloud with a foot, chuckling about his 
terrible physical condition. She left them there, eyes following her 
curiously, and with a turn around a bend as she homed in on that 
feeling, she saw a pool of water that glowed. It lit up the entire room 
with strange highlights.

&quot;Cloud, Tifa!&quot; she called, stepping close to the water.

She ran her hands into it as the two arrived to see her there, and she 
continued talking softly; &quot;It&#39;s full of knowledge... consciousness... a 
living soul... It&#39;s trying to say something. I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t 
understand. What? What is it? ...Danger? An evil... consciousness? 
...show? You&#39;re going to show me?&quot;

She pulled back as Tifa and Cloud both ducked down, one to each side and 
the water grew in brilliance until colours could be defined, the scene 
sharpening...

------------------------------------------

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;Shhh, Cloud. Look, it&#39;s showing us!&quot;

Tseng stood close by a mural, examining it minutely as his subordinate; 
the blonde called Elena hovered and saluted at his shoulder. Her eyes 
took in the paintings, &quot;Tseng, what is this? Can we find the Promised 
Land with this?&quot;

&quot;...I wonder. Anyway, we have to report to the President.&quot;

&quot;Be careful Tseng.&quot; She saluted again, and as she turned to go, Tseng 
said in a voice bordering on heartbreak;

&quot;Yeah, hey Elena. How &#39;bout dinner when this job is over?&quot;

&quot;Th...Thank you very much,&quot; she breathed, eyes wide, &quot;...If I may be 
excused?&quot;

She left, clasping hands to reddened cheeks in alarm and her eyes wide 
with surprise. Tseng returned to eyeing the murals, hands behind his 
back and thumbs twiddling, an old habit from his past. He spoke to no 
one but himself, &quot;Is this the Promised Land? No, it can&#39;t be...&quot;

There was light, there was sound and there was Sephiroth. The Masamune 
glinted in his hand, as if hungering and his eyes, stark green, were 
wild. Tseng jumped in alarm at reached a hand for the gun in it&#39;s 
holster warily, not once touching it however. &quot;Sephiroth!&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; said the General in his mellifluous voice, rich and warm, &quot;You 
opened the door, well done.&quot;

&quot;This place, what is it?&quot;

&quot;A lost treasure house of Knowledge. The wisdom of the Ancients,&quot; he 
laughed and straightened, glancing to the mural with a sinister smile 
covering his lips, &quot;I am becoming one with the Planet.&quot;

&quot;One... with the... Planet?&quot; His lips formed the name of the last 
Ancient, but no sound gave it life.

Sephiroth simply sneered; &quot;You stupid fools. You have never even thought 
about it. All the spirit energy of this Planet. All its wisdom... 
knowledge... I will meld with it all. I will become one with it... it 
will become one with me.&quot;

Awe slid onto the face of the Turk boss, &quot;You... can do that?&quot;

&quot;The way...&quot; he moved, it was so fast no eye could have followed it. But 
they saw the effect, the sword ramming through Tseng&#39;s chest without any 
hint of resistance. Sephiroth&#39;s lips hovered by the conch curl of 
Tseng&#39;s ear where he whispered, &quot;...lies here. Only death awaits you 
all. But do not fear. For it is through death that new spirit energy is 
born. Soon, you will live again as a part of me.&quot;

--------------------------------------------

They pulled back, each pale faced, but Aerith&#39;s expression was close to 
confused.

&quot;...did you...see it?&quot; She asked slowly.

&quot;Yeah, but...&quot;

&quot;Where is the room with all the murals?&quot; Cloud asked over the top of 
Tifa, who shot him a dark look. Aerith tugged on her hair - it wasn&#39;t 
far at all but in there something else lay, something she had seen and 
they hadn&#39;t. She had to know.

I have to.

&quot;Almost there.&quot;

&quot;Sephiroth is here, right?&quot; Cloud brushed at his hair, his eyes 
unfocused, &quot;No matter what he thinks, it&#39;s going to end here. I&#39;m going 
to take him out!&quot;

--------------------------------------------

The room wasn&#39;t far away at all, a long stretch that gaped far and wide, 
with carved pictures in the walls and the sense of closeness about that 
room which strangled the mind. She nodded to the murals and waited 
breathlessly as Cloud called out into the room. To her side, Tifa came 
up close, an arm encircling her waist protectively.

&quot;So cold,&quot; a voice whispered and they all glanced around. The General, 
with white hair gleaming, was knelt, shimmering as if insubstantial, at 
the very end of the hall, yet his voice carried. &quot;I am always by your 
side... ...splendid... a treasure house of knowledge...&quot;

Cloud scowled, &quot;I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re saying.&quot;

&quot;Look well.&quot;

&quot;At what?&quot; His frustration was barely checked and it made a smirk appear 
on the mouth of the twisted man, of Jenova blood and horrific birth.

&quot;At that which adds to the knowledge of...? I am becoming one with the 
Planet.&quot;

One with the Planet!

She didn&#39;t know what he meant at all. To become one with it was to die. 
Was he dying?

So with roused interest, she was forced to ask: &quot;Become one with the 
Planet, how do you intend to do that?&quot;

His eyes sought her, roved over her form so she felt naked under that 
revealing, stripping gaze that tore away all her protections, even 
clothes. A fanciful mind may conceive that he indeed, saw under all her 
&#39;armaments&#39; and the like. She swallowed under the scrutiny, blushing 
even as a sadistic little smile quirked his lips, piqued there as Tifa 
came to stand in front of her. She stared at the smooth roundness of 
Tifa&#39;s bare shoulder and upper arm, the soft scent of her hair and the 
winning feel of having her hero stand there for her, like a champion. 
She leaned into Tifa, as Cloud&#39;s attention seemed to be riveted wholly 
on Sephiroth, and kissed her gently in gratitude upon the curve of her 
graceful neck. Sephiroth just grinned.

But he chose to humour her. &quot;It&#39;s simple. Once the Planet is hurt, it 
gathers Spirit Energy to heal the injury. The amount of energy gathered 
depends on the size of the injury. ...What would happen if there was an 
injury that threatened the very life of the Planet? Think how much 
energy would be gathered! Ha ha ha. And at the centre of that injury, 
will be me. All that boundless energy will be mine. By merging with all 
the energy of the Planet, I will become a new life form, a new 
existence. Melding with the Planet... I will cease to exist as I am 
now... Only to be reborn as a &#39;God&#39; to rule over every soul.&quot;

&quot;An injury powerful enough to destroy the Planet? Injure the Planet?&quot; 
she repeated numbly as though he spoke a whole other language.

&quot;Behold... the mural,&quot; he swept his arm as he stood up, &quot;The ultimate 
destruction magic - Meteor.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;ll never happen!&quot; Cloud snarled, dashing forward and then there 
was a flash of light and Sephiroth was gone, leaving Cloud to stumble a 
few steps then stand alone in the room by the mural, arms limp. At least 
until he started laughing.

Hysterically.

She and Tifa exchanged alarmed looks and together they hurried to his 
side, each one unsure if they should touch him. Cloud&#39;s eyes were open 
and blank, but still blue, tears streaming down his cheeks to his chin 
where they dripped off and he continued to laugh, &quot;Black Materia... 
hahaha! Call Meteor... hahahaha!&quot;

&quot;Cloud,&quot; Aerith said, then firmly shook his shoulder, &quot;Cloud, get a hold 
of yourself!&quot;

&quot;Cloud... I&#39;m Cloud... Cloud...&quot; He struggled, some recognition fighting 
into his blank eyes. &quot;I should remember... what do I? Remember? 
Remember... Cloud... my...way...&quot;

&quot;Cloud...&quot; She breathed sadly as he gave a great shudder. In that moment 
she knew, the strings Sephiroth had tied to Cloud all those years ago 
starting with the incident at the Nibelheim reactor - those strings 
lingered still and made the poor man dance like a broken puppet all for 
the evil mans sick and twisted amusement. Everything he could have been 
was buried under years of self doubt, self pity, self hate, a feeling of 
inferiority screwed to sticking point by the influence of that madman.

&quot;I...&quot; he shook his head then sighed, looking up at them, &quot;Hmm... what&#39;s 
wrong? Is something wrong?&quot;

&quot;I...It&#39;s nothing, so don&#39;t worry about it Cloud,&quot; she smiled, the best 
fake smile she could, &quot;Right, it&#39;s nothing. Sephiroth got away 
though...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it... I understand what he was saying,&quot; His eyes were 
confused though, &quot;So... this must be Meteor, right?&quot;

&quot;Meteor... it looks to be huge, and dangerous,&quot; Tifa murmured.

&quot;...this must be magic.&quot; Aerith backed away from them and pressed hands 
to her temple - was there wailing and panic? &quot;Just what Sephiroth was 
saying? The Ultimate Destructive Magic, Meteor. It finds small drifting 
planets with its magic. And then collides with them. This Planet might 
get wiped out entirely...&quot;

And just as she said that, a great dragon crashed through the wall, 
blowing chunks of brick and mortar everywhere, with splinters of wood 
from the door and she screamed.

&quot;Hahaha,&quot; echoed Sephiroth&#39;s mocking laughter.

-----------------------------------------

The fight was brutal but a mark of just how far they had come in such a 
short space of time. Between a few swift angry blows from Cloud, her own 
ice magic and Tifa&#39;s incredible agility, they had rounded the dragon up 
and put it down quickly. The wounds they&#39;d sustained were little to 
nothing, something she felt a touch smug about (after all, they had 
encountered one similar on the slopes of Nibelheim when Yuffie had tried 
catching dinner and ended up running back to camp being chased by two 
wyrmlings and a Red Dragon...).

Now though, after Cait had said they could use his stuffed body to take 
the Black Materia out of the temple, as his sacrifice to a team that he 
had betrayed, she stood by the door to the outside world, staring 
helplessly into his lifeless eyes, wishing hard that something, anything 
she could say would make this moment go away, would make it less tragic.

But his huge soft hands cupped hers gently, stroking her tanned skin and 
the old, small and softening calluses from hours spent in her beloved 
garden and she found she could not weep for this brave soul, willing to 
give up something for them, willing to do it despite all their thoughts 
and fears of traitors and liars and thieves in the night.

&quot;Sorry to keep you waiting,&quot; Cait spoke up suddenly. His little cat 
bobbed around on his head, megaphone waved like a pennant, like a 
general waves to give orders. His accent made even those grim words 
sound cheerful and she almost smiled, &quot;I&#39;ll handle the rest. Well then 
everyone, take care of yourselves!&quot;

&quot;Cait Sith...&quot; she cast a desperate look to Tifa who shook her head, 
then Cloud, &quot;Come on Cloud, say something.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m... not good at this,&quot; the blond murmured.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Cait just grinned in the lackadaisical way he adopted sometimes, 
to afford them ease around a walking, talking stuffed animal, &quot;I feel 
kinda the same.&quot;

&quot;Well... why don&#39;t you read our fortunes?&quot;

She was surprised at herself for even asking this, turning red to the 
roots of her hair. Tifa folded her arms, a dark look saying that she 
knew what Aerith was going to say, but after the episode with Sephiroth, 
also knowing that Cloud really needed to be cheered up. She pleaded 
silently for a moment with her green eyes, seeking understanding, and 
then with a short laugh, Tifa assented with a reluctant nod, but a 
twinkle in her dark eyes that promised her own pleasure in gaining 
revenge somehow, usually a tickle-fight which Aerith always lost hands 
down.

&quot;Say, that&#39;s right... I haven&#39;t done it in a while, huh? I&#39;m so 
excited.&quot; Indeed, he started bouncing around happily. &quot;Right or wrong, 
I&#39;m still the same &#39;ol me. Now, what should I predict?&quot;

She looked from Tifa and then went to stand by Cloud, lifting a hand and 
cheerfully saying: &quot;Hmm... lets see how compatible Cloud and I are!&quot;

Cait laughed, &quot;That&#39;ll cost ya. Exactly one date! Here I go!&quot; She 
smothered a giggle at the very idea of a stuffed mog going on a date - 
this wasn&#39;t precisely the time to crack up over the image of Cait wedged 
into the Gondola... funny as it was... no, straight face! There was a 
ding after moments of him waving his arms about in arcane patterns, and 
then Cait looked at Tifa in a panic and cringed. &quot;This isn&#39;t good. I 
can&#39;t say it. Poor Tifa.&quot;

Poor Tifa? ...does he know and Tifa and me!

She blinked, as Tifa blushed and looked away surreptitiously. Oh, so 
Tifa had been telling people!

&quot;No! Tell me! I promise I won&#39;t get mad!&quot;

Cait lowered the card, then smiled sadly; &quot;Is that so? Then I&#39;ll tell 
you. Looks good. You are perfect for each other! Aeris&#39;s star and 
Cloud&#39;s star! They show a great future! Cloud, I&#39;ll be your matchmaker, 
preacher... I&#39;ll do whatever you want me to! You just call me when it 
all happens!&quot; She bit her lip and watched Tifa&#39;s expression, which was 
slightly sad. &quot;Thank you for believing in me, know that I was a spy. 
This is the final, final farewell!&quot;

&quot;Cait,&quot; she said in alarm as he hurried off, then with tears streaming, 
she lifted a hand and whispered, &quot;...be strong, Cait Sith...&quot;

&quot;We should go out,&quot; Cloud announced, bright red and eyes sparkling, no 
doubt from that reading Cait had done, &quot;Or we&#39;ll be crushed. Hurry!&quot;

...and as one, they hurried to the door, even if Aerith dragged her feet 
a little behind everyone else...

-------------------------------------------

Light.

The sound of something softly crying.

Air became hot, overheated, contracting into itself.

Then in the pit where the temple had been, when the light faded there 
sat only a single piece of rock that if it weren&#39;t for the trained eye, 
someone would mistake as being a chunk of obsidian, raw and unpolished 
power trapped within the dark heart of the small materia that could 
bring an end to everything they knew so easily, so quickly. Carefully, 
as Tifa stayed by the top to keep watch, she and Cloud descended down 
and he scooped the materia up, holding the dark glassy object to the 
sun, disappointed when no light refracted through the murky depths.

She smiled at him. &quot;We did it.&quot;

&quot;And as long as we have it, Sephiroth can&#39;t use it.&quot; Cloud pulled his 
hand down, blue eyes still twinkling with excitement travelling to meet 
hers shyly, like a boy who has discovered what it is to love for the 
first time, &quot;Can you guys use it?&quot;

&quot;Nope,&quot; she said and twined her arms about her middle, &quot;One person&#39;s 
power alone won&#39;t do. You need a lot of spiritual power to use it. 
Somewhere special, where there is plenty of the Planet&#39;s energy... Oh! 
The Promised Land!&quot;

&quot;The Promised Land! No...but...&quot;

Aerith looked at him and shook her head, &quot;No, Sephiroth is different. 
He&#39;s not an Ancient.&quot;

&quot;He shouldn&#39;t be able to find the Promised Land, then.&quot;

As if summoned, the demons voice rang through the air; &quot;Oh but I have. 
I&#39;m far superior to the Ancients. I became a traveller of the Lifestream 
and gained the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients. And soon, I will 
create the future.&quot;

Surprising herself, she pushed Cloud from the way. It was almost like 
her dream, so alike that she could feel the power inside her curdle with 
it, growing stronger with each passing moment she stood in 
confrontation, &quot;The future is not yours alone, I won&#39;t let you do it!&quot; 
she shouted to the sky from the pit where the Temple of Ages once stood.

&quot;Ha ha ha... I wonder... wake up!&quot;

Wake up? No...

Cloud clutched his head and went onto his knees almost instantly. 
Frightened by this, she looked upwards to see Tifa peering over the pit 
edge in alarm. Then she looked down and reached over to him as he began 
to move slowly. The point where he was heading to there stood an image 
of Sephiroth, tall and handsome in a sinister fashion, with his black 
clad hand out stretched to take the materia from his unwilling little 
puppet in a play of souls, a theatre of dead dreams he liked to command. 
She wanted to stop him, but her tugging did nothing, her voice did not 
reach his deaf ears.

The chink was loud as materia passed hands.

I have failed?

&quot;...well done,&quot; smirked the General, and vanished.

Cloud collapsed onto his knees. Shaking, and trying to draw breath, she 
could see the strain being controlled had placed on him - had he fought 
hard against those bonds on him? She left her spot to reach his side, 
touching his back then moving the light touch into a rubbing motion, 
designed to soothe him. &quot;Cloud, are you alright?&quot;

&quot;I gave the Black Materia to... Sephiroth... what... what did I do... 
tell me Aerith...&quot;

She bit her lip. &quot;Cloud... be strong, ok?&quot; - It wasn&#39;t your fault.

&quot;Urrrrgh, what have I done!&quot; he screamed, rearing back so she tripped 
over and fell hard onto the ground.

Eyes wide, she stared up at him, at his blank eyes, &quot;Cloud, you haven&#39;t 
done anything! It&#39;s not your fault!&quot; she tried yelling back.

The first blow landed. She was unsure at first if she had been struck, 
but the pain bloomed fiercely behind her cheekbone, and by the time the 
next blow struck her cleanly on the temple, mercifully knocking her 
unconscious, all she could do inside was weep for Cloud...

--------------------------------------

He was beating her.

He was savaging her.

I scaled the walls to Hell to rescue the Angel, but he was like a 
madman.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; I screeched at him.

Possessed by demons, he flailed at the light of our lives, trying to 
extinguish it. There was blood on the rocks - how badly had she suffered 
abuse at his hands? Defenceless little flower, wilting gently in the 
heat of day, suffering cruel attacks and yet still, struggling on, how I 
admire you, little flower.

So he eventually slowed, eyes filling with terror as sanity came back to 
him. I cried out for her, &quot;What have you done?&quot;

And dumbly he repeated, &quot;What have I done?&quot;

But as blood trickled from the corner of the mouth I lavished kisses 
upon, rage replaced my own sanity. Jealousy was the monster inside me, 
jealousy, hatred, hate, hate, hate. I hated him, for hurting her. I 
hated him, for loving her. I hated him, for having a star that matched 
hers. I hated him for being born socially acceptable as a man to love a 
woman. I hated him so much in that moment, that sanity; a little voice 
in my head curled up and ran away. Love, the blessing and the curse, the 
double edged sword was driven deep in my heart and because of love, I 
knew how to really hate for the first time... and the blow that took his 
waking moments was hard. It was brutal. It was a rough caress of my 
foot, the banging pound, the thump of steel into the back of his head. 
He may have bled. I didn&#39;t know. I didn&#39;t care.

Cradling the body of Aerith who breathed, if only just; I picked up the 
PHS and screamed for help.

Somewhere, the plan to stop Sephiroth, the plan to get the materia, the 
plan to stop it all, had gone horribly wrong.

...and then I heard it...

...tick...

...tick...

...tick...

...and knew suddenly, time was running out. But... what for?</pre>
