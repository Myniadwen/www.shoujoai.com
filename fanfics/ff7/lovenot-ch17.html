This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her
When she smiles

How many days in a year
She woke up with hope but she only found tears
I can be so insincere,
Making the promises never for real
As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear?
When you look in the mirror so how do you choose?
- Story of a Girl - Three Doors Down

-------------------------------------------------

They found them curled on the shore with the light of dawn, where Tifa 
slept soundly and she curled hands to cover her eyes, gummed with salt 
from tears she had kept to herself so selfishly, so jealously, guarding 
the fears in her iron willed heart. They&#39;d come over to offer as much 
assistance as they could, waking up the sleeping fist fighter who was 
just getting the energy up to cough, coughing up residue from her lungs 
that she had breathed in when drowning, falling and sinking away from 
the tender grasp of the Ancient&#39;s fingers.

Cloud wrapped her in a blanket as Yuffie, holding a materia she used 
almost as well as Aerith (but not quite with the same masterful flair) 
tried to heal up the dredges of any wounds that she may have missed with 
her ancient magic. So Tifa curled and slept in weak sickness on the wing 
of the plane which they had suddenly decided to try using as a boat to 
surprising efficiency, leaving just enough room for them on the wings of 
it. But their journey was to a shore close by the village of Gongaga 
where they could purchase healing supplies. Each day that passed, Tifa&#39;s 
cough grew worse and she slept more, feverish with sickness.

Aerith knew without speaking, because words would only get in the way, 
that the wound which Tifa laboured under was a wound to her soul from 
the experience of almost dying, a wound that she couldn&#39;t heal - she, 
the master healer! It was a wound that only time could take away. So 
between short trips where she would hold onto Tifa&#39;s body and wonder how 
she had ever considered her physically intimidating, lying there so 
still and so vulnerable with only the Ancient as her lifeline, she 
cajoled the waking Tifa into trying to take joy from the world.

It was a small success each time a smile curved the pretty lips and 
touched dark eyes, frightening away the haunting memory of water that 
she felt kinship with the fighter for having. It haunted her too of 
course, but her concern for Tifa drove away all her childish fears. Each 
night, when Tifa lay sleeping peacefully, face turned towards her in her 
lap and arms curled about the only blanket that hadn&#39;t been burned 
horribly by the plane hitting the water and the oil fire it had caused, 
Cloud would sit with them and talk quietly about Tifa&#39;s condition. It 
was from these talks that she gleaned that once upon a time, Cloud had 
loved Tifa desperately and with a lost feeling in her heart, she 
wondered if those feelings were returned. But then when his hand briefly 
brushed the back of hers, she knew she was back into the corner between 
Cloud and Tifa&#39;s affections, both strong.

All she could feel was lost.

Then the night after she woke from a terrible dream, sometime around 
midnight, she realised that the hand stroking her hair was none other 
than that of Tifa&#39;s. The girl looked wan and sickly in the moonlight, 
her cheeks a little hollow and a gloved hand covered her mouth to 
capture the wrenching cough that sounded wet, too horribly wet for 
words. She didn&#39;t move her head from the spot where it was on her curled 
up jacket which acted as a rather lumpy pillow, her face smooth but 
tears spilling down her cheeks and nose, at the tilted angle of slumber.

&quot;You were having a bad dream,&quot; Tifa said softly so her voice wouldn&#39;t 
carry and alert the others, camped as they were outside Gongaga after 
several days of endless seeming travel. &quot;It&#39;s okay, I&#39;m here.&quot;

&quot;You should be asleep,&quot; she whispered back, concern filtering into her 
voice again. Tifa only smiled back, lowering hand from mouth to rest by 
her cheek.

&quot;I know. But I somehow knew you were frightened, so I woke up.&quot;

&quot;You knew?&quot;

&quot;Just, like lightning. Bam. It woke me right up. You know, you don&#39;t 
have to be frightened when I&#39;m around.&quot; Then came more rounds of 
coughing and she reached out and gripped the hand on her cheek tightly. 
When they calmed, she brushed her mouth and smiled, &quot;It&#39;ll pass. I just 
need to sleep after seeing a doctor, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s one where we&#39;re 
going.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t understand why my magic won&#39;t fix it. I&#39;m not much of a healer, 
eh? I&#39;m sorry Tifa, I should have been there quicker.&quot;

&quot;Hey, it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m amazed you managed it in that dress and those 
boots. But... can I ask what you dreamed about?&quot;

&quot;Oh...that is... that&#39;s right,&quot; She sat up, much to Tifa&#39;s alarm as she 
sluggishly tried to rise in vain after her. Her eyes looked around, 
catching the gaze of the others awake by the fire, pretty much everyone 
apart from Yuffie who was in a hunched over heap, face to the ground and 
backside in the air, snoring softly. &quot;I had an answer.&quot;

Cloud blinked from his daze and lifted his voice just a little, against 
the oppression of the black velvet night, everyone listening quietly, 
&quot;An answer, Aerith?&quot;

&quot;Yes. I asked the Planet... what to do, after the ShinRa found us. It 
told me, in my sleep. There should be a temple, the Ancient&#39;s Temple, 
somewhere to the south, I can navigate us there, and the Planet will 
call me.&quot; She looked down, &quot;It said, someone who wishes great harm to 
the Planet is already there.&quot;

&quot;Great harm? Sephiroth, it must be.&quot; He stood up, &quot;Then we&#39;d best go.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that simple!&quot;

They stopped, Barrett already rising to break camp and eyes trained back 
to her, so intent that she found herself blushing vibrantly, glad of the 
cover which shadows granted.

&quot;I mean,&quot; She said softly, &quot;There&#39;s a key to getting into the temple. It 
used to be around the temple but an explorer took it away, but the 
Planet says it&#39;s close by.&quot;

&quot;How close by?&quot; Vincent asked just as softly.

&quot;It said... it lies in the castle of the clouds.&quot;

&quot;Castle of the Clouds?&quot; Cloud frowned as Barrett gave a groan and sat 
down again, &quot;...A floating island?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t know about that,&quot; Vincent said softly, &quot;But the only castle in 
the clouds I can think of is the Gold Saucer.&quot;

&quot;Are you serious? We have to go back there!&quot; Barrett really groaned this 
time and Yuffie kicked with a snort in the throes of her sleep, jerking 
herself awake with a muffled noise. Cloud looked upset and glanced 
towards her, &quot;No mistaking it?&quot;

Aerith shook her head, &quot;Sorry guys.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be sorry, Aerith,&quot; Tifa laid a hand on her shoulder, half using 
her to stay upright, &quot;Besides, the Gold Saucer has medical supplies and 
soft, fluffy beds to stay in, not to mention that we can see more of the 
sights and not get kicked out into a desert prison full of degenerate 
inmates this time.&quot;

&quot;Yo, Tifa, you didn&#39;t have t&#39;look at me when ya said that!&quot; Barrett 
gruffly huffed, much to the gentle murmur of laughter that rippled about 
the group. He turned his back and laid down once more in his own 
slightly spotty blankets. &quot;Sheesh. Mister Leader, get a plan sorted, 
awright? Night.&quot;

&quot;A plan? Not like it&#39;s difficult. We go to the Gold Saucer, and find 
this key to the temple, and then go face down Sephiroth.&quot; Cloud rubbed a 
hand into his hair, &quot;but first we&#39;d better sleep. North Corel is a good 
day&#146;s walk. Vincent, wake me for last watch.&quot;

The dark man nodded and returned to his strange upright way of sleeping, 
back to a rock, as though alert even in slumber for danger. Cloud 
glanced at him then shivered and turned his blue gaze in Aerith&#39;s 
direction, making colour bloom in her cheeks again, for the look was 
decidedly more than what friendship would warrant. Looking away, she 
eased Tifa back into lying down and then lay beside her. Without 
volition, she glanced to the face of the woman called most ironically, 
Lockhart and was surprised to see her looking back.

&quot;Aerith, I have to ask something. What isn&#39;t long?&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot;

&quot;You keep murmuring that something won&#39;t be long. What won&#39;t be long?&quot;

Aerith smiled, because it seemed the natural thing to do, &quot;Until we face 
Sephiroth all together. Not long at all.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Tifa turned this over in her mind for a moment, then Aerith was 
greeted with a smile much like hers, warm and trusting, flowing right 
back to her. &quot;Makes sense. I can&#39;t wait,&quot; she yawned and snuggled down, 
cheek on a hand and eyes closing sleepily, &quot;I have so much of the world 
to show you... you&#39;ll...love it...&quot;

Wordlessly, Aerith turned her back on the soft breathing of the sleeping 
figure and bit her lip hard enough to bring blood to the surface, but 
the tears came this time with the ache in her chest. Hiding it from the 
world, she silently wept out her lonely pain into the night and hoped 
tomorrow would be different...

--------------------------------------------

The shore sparkled.

She stood, shoulder to shoulder with two people, holding their hands 
gently but firmly, tightly even, afraid to let go, afraid because they 
might vanish. They gripped back just as tightly, wordless to the song 
she knew she should be singing, through lips frozen with doubt and with 
fear.

Beyond them, water as green as the sea shimmered and waved, full of 
life, full of knowledge and of beauty, the sheer joy of every life 
contained within it - be it the cries of a newborn child, the love of a 
mature heart or the first steps of friendship, the innocence or the 
pleasure, it was alive with it.

So she smiled, because it was beautiful.

The woman who stood to her left, whispered; &quot;You promised me.&quot;

The man who stood to her right, also whispered; &quot;I don&#39;t make promises 
lightly, you know that.&quot;

And all she knew to say was, &quot;It was something I had to do. How can I 
explain it?&quot;

&quot;I love you,&quot; they both said together and she looked, from the familiar 
face of Tifa to the face of Cloud, each one dear and each one engraved 
on her heart and soul forever. But they didn&#39;t look down at her; instead 
they looked across the water.

So she removed her hands from theirs and began to walk slowly into the 
flowing essence of everything that ever is, or was, or could be, drawing 
her down into the depths of eternity. Behind her, she heard a cry and 
turned. Tifa pushed Cloud from the way and came running towards her, 
arms open.

But she fell through her, into the water.

&quot;I would give it all up, you know,&quot; she said calmly, as Tifa dragged 
herself, sobbing, up from the clinging water. &quot;All of it. Because... 
neither of you would ever ask it of me. I know it. But I know this as 
much as I know the sun must rise each day, as much as laughter is the 
best medicine and that love goes on beyond death, I know this much... 
that I must go. And you must stay.&quot;

&quot;But, I love you!&quot;

And with tears that glinted like the mystical, magical water, she smiled 
sadly, at them both and said, &quot;I know.&quot;

------------------------------------------------

They filed from the blue runway plane, Aerith scribbling away in her 
journal as Vincent steered her gently from tripping over kids that 
muddled around them, balloons in hands, hooting at the joy of the 
amusement park. She, in turn, leaned on Barrett and held in her heart 
the hope of being allowed to take some medicine soon enough, a good 
expectorant or the like would be heaven to her hurting lungs right about 
now! This time, having amassed a fair set of funds, Cloud gave up the 
money for a lifetime ticket, much to the shrieks of delight from the 
always excitable Yuffie, who proclaimed that she would use it until 
holes appeared in it. Cid and Red then remarked the holes would only be 
there via her stealing what used to be in place of the holes.

Always the same.

As they hurried inside, she gave a sigh coupled with a smile at seeing 
Aerith almost walk into a wall, saved at the last moment by Cait&#39;s soft 
and squishy body. She squeaked an apology and put away the diary 
sheepishly, after a stern look from the ex-Turk. Then she laughed and 
poked his arm gently, murmuring that he should lighten up - to Tifa&#39;s 
surprise, he almost managed to look... normal in that moment.

Aerith&#39;s strange power. Opening up the hearts of those around her.

Gladly, she let herself be led away to the hotel which promised medical 
help. Aerith offered to go with them, but for once Tifa had to agree 
with Cloud...

&quot;No, you have to go, you&#39;re the only Cetra. You&#39;ll find the key in no 
time at all.&quot; Tifa smiled, &quot;Otherwise, Cloud would spend all his time 
and gil in the amusements.&quot;

&quot;Tifa!&quot; Cloud said indignantly.

&quot;Oh you know it&#39;s true. I&#39;ve seen you on arcade machines before. You&#39;d 
spend everything you&#39;ve ever earned to get a high score.&quot;

&quot;Well this time is different.&quot;

&quot;Exactly, Aerith is going with you and she&#39;ll keep an eye on your 
spending.&quot; She smirked just a little, catching his crestfallen look as 
she winked at the Ancient, who laughed into a hand with delight. &quot;She&#39;s 
a good girl.&quot;

&quot;You love destroying all my fun,&quot; he groaned.

&quot;Fun, pfft, time for fun later, after you get the key.&quot;

&quot;Tifa&#39;s right, we can play a bit later on.&quot;

&quot;Not you too,&quot; Cloud groaned again, at Aerith who chuckled and tucked 
her arms behind her back, beaming a smile. &quot;Alright, alright... we get 
the key first. Since when did you two start knowing me so well! Come on 
Aerith, Cait, let&#39;s grab it before I get another lecture from Miss 
Lockhart here.&quot;

&quot;Miss!&quot; She replied in similar tones of affront, then she watched with a 
smile as Cloud stomped off, trying to pretend he was upset. Aerith waved 
a little before slipping into the tube after him, tugging the soft and 
expansive form of Cait along with her, so he didn&#39;t get stuck. She 
looked up, cheeks flushed, to the knowing gaze of Barrett. &quot;...what?&quot;

&quot;Tifa, how long?&quot;

&quot;Er,&quot; she tried to feign puzzlement as they made their way to the hotel 
up the steps, &quot;How long, what? How long is a piece of string? That&#39;s 
easy, twice as half its length.&quot;

&quot;No, you know what I mean, how long you been in love with her?&quot;

&quot;B-Barrett...&quot;

He grinned and hauled her up as she missed her step with surprise, 
&quot;C&#39;mon kid, you know me better than that. Sure, I might not be the 
brightest crayon in da box, but I&#39;m always watchin&#39; out fer ya, ya know? 
She&#39;s a nice girl, can see what appeals t&#39;ya. Not that I&#39;m judgin&#39;, ya 
know? Love is love. If you&#39;re happy, then I&#39;m happy an&#39; I&#39;ll break th&#39; 
heads of anyone who argues, awright?&quot;

She peered at him for a moment, then ducked her head with tears flooding 
to her eyes, arms gripping his massive one tightly, &quot;Barrett!&quot; she 
cried.

&quot;Long enough, eh?&quot;

&quot;Since I met her, I think.&quot;

&quot;She knows how you feel?&quot;

She bit her lip and then smiled, almost feeling on the verge of a 
hysterical laugh, &quot;Yes, she does know. She accepted me... I... love is 
wonderful, Barrett, and I&#39;m in love!&quot;

He chuckled and pushed open the hotel doors to a scream from inside the 
mock-spooky place that only managed a kind of camp effect instead, 
hovering on the outright cheesy. But his brown eyes when she looked up, 
they were warm; &quot;Ain&#39;t that somethin&#39;, Teef.&quot;

-------------------------------------------------

It was some time before they came back, looking worn out, and sore and 
completely disgruntled. Tifa had made sure to check herself and Aerith 
into a double room, leaving Yuffie and Red paired up, Cid and Vincent, 
Barrett and Cait and lucky Cloud to have a single room to his self. Cid 
had been slightly verbose about sharing a room with a, &quot;god forsaken 
mother-fu&amp; $! Vampire!&quot; but once they&#39;d explained that Cid&#39;s room was 
smoking he&#39;d calmed down a little. Vincent, as per usual, hadn&#39;t 
twitched as much as an eyebrow through the entire exchange.

&quot;Well,&quot; Cloud announced tiredly, &quot;We got the Keystone. That&#39;s its name, 
apparently.&quot;

&quot;And Cloud didn&#39;t once go into the arcade either,&quot; Aerith smiled, coming 
to sit by Tifa and stretch, &quot;But wow, we did some serious walking to 
find it. Then...&quot;

&quot;Then a worker told us that the runway is broken.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Yuffie said suddenly, sitting up, &quot;Broken how!&quot;

Cait shrugged and started up the stairs to his room, &quot;They didn&#39;t say, 
but it won&#39;t be working until tomorrow. Good thing y&#39;all booked us in, 
but I know the manager here so we can stay for free.&quot;

&quot;That saves us some gil at least,&quot; Tifa sighed.

&quot;Did you get the medicine?&quot; Aerith murmured, leaning to look at her face 
so intently that Tifa was forced to try hard not to blush. &quot;And how do 
you feel?&quot;

&quot;Apart from a little tired, not bad. They had something for it, 
thankfully, but I need a good nights sleep for the full effects.&quot;

&quot;Then we should go to bed. Seems like we all need the rest,&quot; the flower 
girl stood up, &quot;Need a hand getting to your room?&quot;

&quot;Ah, we&#39;re bunking together, Aerith.&quot; Why did it feel so awkward, just 
telling her that they were sleeping in the same room? Alone. It hadn&#39;t 
been so much of a problem when she&#39;d kept her growing desire and love to 
herself! Love, what a complicated and confusing emotion the world had 
ever known. &quot;But, I can get there just fine.&quot;

&quot;Alright, I&#39;m going to study the keystone a bit first.&quot; She went to sit 
on the soft couch and put the green object in her lap. Tifa almost 
opened her mouth to say that she really did need help, at least to get 
to bed, then closed it just as quickly as Cloud touched Aerith&#39;s 
shoulder and moved upstairs, followed by the others to their respective 
beds. At a glance around, she curled an arm about her middle and started 
up the stairs.

Halfway up, she heard Aerith&#39;s soft, beautiful voice call, &quot;Sweet 
dreams, Teef.&quot;

If I am lucky enough to dream of you.

She sighed and made her way to her room, closing the door behind her and 
looking at the &#39;spooky&#39; decor as well as the two separate beds. Then 
with a smile, she just lay down on the edge of one, promising herself 
she&#39;d stay awake until Aerith came upstairs, to give her a goodnight 
kiss, but sleep and her own ill body had other ideas and soon enough, 
she was out cold, dreaming of nothing at all.

--------------------------------------------

I suppose if it&#39;s not long until I do your bidding, I must make good on 
at least one promise, Planet.

Which is?

A date I promised Cloud a long time ago.

So there&#146;s a date for him and not one for Tifa?

...when it&#39;s all over, I&#39;ll take her on a thousand dates, each one more 
meaningful than the last.

And who said romance was dead?

It&#39;s not dead, just sleeping! Anyway... I&#39;ll think more about the 
Keystone later, alright? Just let me have a bit of time to be human, to 
be a girl of my age for once!

Please?

Alright.

She smiled and knocked gently on the door to Cloud&#39;s room, greeted by a 
distant murmur of &#39;Come in&#39;. Clutching the keystone, she pushed the door 
open and slid inside, putting the object down on the dresser by the door 
and making a quick mental note of the safety she was to leave it in, 
Cloud was stood at the end of the gothic furnished room, staring through 
the windows, but he turned to see who it was who entered, a smile 
spreading quickly across his face at the sight of her. &quot;Aerith.&quot;

&quot;Cloud, are you busy?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; he shrugged; he&#39;d left his armour off and looked almost normal 
without it, if it weren&#39;t for the bright glow of his mako eyes. 
Encouraged by her smile at this, he stepped closer to her and tilted his 
head, &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

&quot;No, not at all. I was just thinking,&quot; she tucked her hands behind her 
back, &quot;I made a promise a long time ago to you, remember?&quot;

&quot;A promise?&quot;

&quot;One date. Well, we&#39;re here, so... why don&#39;t we take it.&quot;

He flushed, looking breathless and nervous all at once, &quot;A-aerith... 
with me? Really!&quot;

&quot;Yep, right now, come on. If you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll take it on my own.&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m coming!&quot; He grabbed his gil packed wallet and hurried after 
her, opening the door so she could slip outside. He followed, locking 
the door behind himself and testing the handle. Then he slid his blue 
eyed gaze to her as they started down the stairs, &quot;I know you left the 
keystone in there.&quot;

&quot;I wanted just a night off, from being an Ancient.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

She laughed, touching the last step and dancing towards the door as if 
her steps were made from air, as if she was born to dance, an ethereal 
grace filling her motions. &quot;Don&#39;t you think about it? You&#39;re always 
turning to me for help because I&#39;m the Ancient, the magical Cetra being 
who can right all wrongs. Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s a bit oppressive? I&#39;m 
still Aerith too, just a flower girl who met a soldier and set out to 
change the world. And still a girl, who wants to be taken on some dates 
now and then.&quot;

His face was filled with acknowledgement of her words so suddenly that 
she felt guilty, tongue tied and flustered. But she took his arm and led 
him with laughter touching her words, to the tube that led towards the 
main converging point for all other tubes, by the station. When they 
appeared at the other end someone approached them, a worker for the 
Saucer with a flyer in her hand. She looked tired, but forced a smile 
for them, Cloud looking a touch dizzy.

&quot;Hello there, please enjoy a money free night at the Saucer, for its 
Enchantment Night!&quot;

&quot;Free? What great timing, right Cloud?&quot;

&quot;Gah,&quot; he glanced at his wallet, &quot;I could have left that behind.&quot;

&quot;Oh, what fun,&quot; she laughed and studied the flyer, &quot;Hey, there&#39;s a play 
on.&quot;

&quot;Hmm, you like theatre?&quot;

&quot;Well, sometimes, I always wanted to see Loveless but never had the gil 
to get a ticket to it. But this looks fun, and it&#39;s free. Come on, 
Cloud, let your hair down for tonight. Let&#39;s have some fun!&quot;

He smiled, &quot;Do you take so much joy from everything?&quot;

She countered, &quot;Do you have to scowl about everything?&quot;

Laughing he held his hands up in defeat and willingly followed her to 
the tube for the area where the play would be held, letting her go in 
first. She held in a smile; yes, he was so close to being fixed.

---------------------------------------------

&quot;Oh Cloud, I can&#39;t believe you kissed the King,&quot; she laughed into her 
candy floss helplessly.

Her date was red faced, trying hard to make it look like he hadn&#39;t 
misheard the whispered line from the actor who played the Wizard in the 
play, &quot;It was a mistake. Stop laughing!&quot;

&quot;Heehee, but it was so funny, oh, the Gondola...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right, you like being up high... come on then, it&#39;s free.&quot;

She smiled a little, watching him hurry to the ticket booth to grab two 
tickets, following at a slower pace. The play had really been hilarious, 
what with his terribly acting and all the mistakes he&#39;d made, but the 
night was young and the moon was high in the sky and the prospect of 
watching the world from high up, it was definitely enchanting. The woman 
at the booth smiled at them, Aerith&#39;s glance confirming that the smile 
was laden with envy for a couple able to go on a date on a night like 
this. But she just smiled back and hurried into the gondola, sitting 
down on the bench opposite from Cloud.

After a shaky start, it ponderously rose into the sky where the stars 
twinkled on the backdrop of the night, the moon brighter than she had 
imagined and much larger seeming at this height. The world played out 
below as the gondola passed by the sights and attractions that the Gold 
Saucer has to offer.

She murmured little words of excitement as they passed each one.

The chocobo racing, the squawk of birds and the cheers of excited people 
as bets were won or the sighs of those who lost and the flashing of 
colours and quickness as the birds sped past.

The plunging dive past the hotel where they were staying and the spooky 
graveyard with the tombstones and the high spires, where fake cobwebs 
clung all silhouetted in the night.

The expanse of the event square where another play was being performed, 
the voices of the actors rising up to meld with the music that reached 
to the sky from the amusement square.

Then a flutter of fireworks, bursting into life and blooming like the 
flowers in her garden, a rich dazzle of pinks and reds, yellows and 
blues and the verdant green then they faded as sparks of fire can only 
fade into the white of stars and she murmured breathlessly, &quot;Oh Cloud, 
how pretty.&quot;

&quot;I thought you&#39;d like it.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s beautiful, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

She dragged her green gaze from the sights to stare at him, looking at 
her in turn with reverence and love, his smile slight but soft, genuine 
and somewhat scared, shy even. Aerith sat back, and folded her hands 
into her lap, with a laugh that tore towards melancholy. Then, without 
realising it, she was speaking quietly.

&quot;At first, it really bothered me, how you looked exactly alike. Two 
completely different people, but they look exactly the same. The way you 
walk, gesture... I think I must have seen him again, in you. But... 
you&#39;re different. Things are different...&quot;

She struggled with tears and words, feeling him lean closer and take her 
hands as fireworks scattered outside, lighting their faces up and 
throwing relief over her tears that trickled down her cheeks. &quot;Cloud... 
I&#39;m searching for you.&quot;

&quot;...?&quot;

&quot;I want to meet you.&quot;

&quot;But...I&#39;m right here.&quot;

How like him to say that! She laughed a little sadly, &quot;I know, I know, 
but what I mean is... I want to meet... you...&quot;

There was a shuffle and then in surprise, she found his lips pressed to 
hers with a flood of heat summoning itself to her cheeks. She neither 
pulled away nor pressed too much into it, enveloped in shock by his 
sudden manoeuvre. But when he pulled back, she covered her burning 
cheeks and panicked, never more feeling like she was stuck between a 
rock and a hard place, nicknamed Tifa and Cloud respectively.

&quot;C-cloud...&quot;

&quot;Then I want you to find me.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;I know you will,&quot; he smiled and then shamefacedly picked candy floss 
from his front, where he&#39;d squashed against her for the stolen kiss, 
&quot;What a mess I made. And the ride&#39;s over.&quot;

&quot;Oh... I was enjoying it.&quot;

&quot;We can do it again?&quot;

&quot;No, we should try and sleep.&quot; She got out of the gondola, Cloud lending 
her a hand over the gap step, and together they strolled towards the 
station tube way point, he still picking at the hardening floss on his 
blue shirt and she, sure as ever, that he was bubbling with the need to 
say more, to do more, but repressing it.

Then as she came round the corner, instinct made her grab at Cloud&#39;s 
hand, who blushed and looked at her with surprise and a parting of his 
lips, pupils becoming larger. &quot;Aerith?&quot;

&quot;Shh... hey, is that Cait Sith, what&#39;s he doing!&quot;

It was: the giant stuffed mog was looking around shiftily, and then he 
produced the Keystone which he held to the light so it glinted brightly. 
Cloud stiffened, &quot;Hey, that&#39;s the Keystone!&quot;

The mog twitched and turned slowly to see them, as Cloud yelled his name 
angrily. With a wave of his hands in a panic, the Mog fled into a tube, 
with the Soldier on his heel. Aerith followed as best she could, 
slipping into the tube a heartbeat or seven after the two, until they 
came to the steps of the Chocobo Arena, all flashing lights and the 
sound of the betting music thumping from inside the raceway. Cait threw 
the stone without warning, a helicopter swooping down and a hand she 
recognised grasping it.

&quot;Well done,&quot; Tseng muttered, his gaze crossing hers briefly.

She paused on the step, pressing hands to the fluttering in the pit of 
her belly, and then it flew away.

Cloud however, rounded on the stuffed mog, grabbing him by the collar. 
&quot;What&#39;s the big idea!&quot;

&quot;H-hey... wait! I won&#39;t run or hide. Yes I was a spy; I was hired by the 
ShinRa.&quot;

Aerith glanced at Cloud who held onto the mog with murderous anger, then 
ducked her head sadly, whispering, &quot;I can&#39;t believe it, I trusted you.&quot;

&quot;I couldn&#39;t help it,&quot; the mog continued in his northern accent, &quot;How 
bout we continue like nothing ever happened?&quot;

&quot;No way, cat,&quot; Cloud spat, &quot;You gotta lot of guts acting like a friend 
but being a spy.&quot;

&quot;Then, what are you goin&#39; to do? Kill me? You&#39;d just be wastin&#39; your 
time if you tried. This body&#39;s just a toy anyway. My real body&#39;s at 
Shinra Headquarters in Midgar. I&#39;m controllin&#39; this toy cat from there.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; she said finally, &quot;You&#39;re from ShinRa! Who are you, tell me!&quot;

Cait looked to her, was it a very wary glance? &quot;Woah, I can&#39;t tell you 
my name.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re not getting anywhere,&quot; Cloud let go.

&quot;See? I told you! Talking won&#39;t do any good, so can&#39;t we just continue 
our journey?&quot;

&quot;You think I&#39;m jokin&#39;?&quot;

&quot;...Alright, yes, I am a ShinRa employee. But we&#39;re not entirely 
enemies. ...Something bothers me. I think it&#39;s your way of life. You 
don&#39;t get paid. You don&#39;t get praised. Yet, you still risk your lives 
and continue on your journey. Seeing that makes me... It just makes me 
think about my life. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d feel too good if things ended the 
way they are now.&quot;

&quot;...and so on,&quot; she murmured.

Cloud took her hand and looked with complete disgust at the mog, then 
spoke to her, trying to reason oddly, as if her compassion would step in 
the way; &quot;He&#39;ll never tell the truth. Once a spy, always a spy. We can&#39;t 
go on with someone like that. C&#39;mon get real!&quot;

Cait&#39;s gaze narrowed and he turned his megaphone over, pressing a few 
switches. &quot;...just as I thought. Talking won&#39;t make a bit of difference. 
But I prepared something in case this happened. Why don&#39;t you listen to 
this?&quot;

&quot;Papa! Tifa!&quot;

Aerith&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;That&#39;s Marlene!&quot;

&quot;Hey, it&#39;s the flower lady, flower lady!&quot; Then it was cut short. Cait 
looked at them both sternly.

&quot;...so you have to do as I say.&quot;

Cloud released her hand, revulsion replacing disgust, &quot;You&#39;re the 
lowest.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t want to do this... using dirty tricks and taking hostages... 
But this is how it is... no compromises. So why don&#39;t we continue on as 
we did? Oh, you didn&#39;t seem to know this, but... The Keystone is the key 
to the Temple of the Ancients. Even so, you&#39;re all going, right? I know 
where it is, so I&#39;ll show you later. The ShinRa have already been there, 
but I guess you have to deal with that.&quot; And so saying, he left, walking 
back to the tube for the hotel.

Aerith turned to Cloud, taking his hand to try and calm the frustration 
rising in him, frightened just a little at the forcefulness of it. 
&quot;Cloud.&quot;

&quot;Well, we&#39;re stuck. We have to do what he says.&quot;

&quot;I wonder if Marlene is alright... ...I wonder what happened to Mom,&quot; 
she sighed, and let Cloud lead her back to her room, dismal thoughts 
choking what had been a pleasant night as fireworks continued to die 
overhead.

-----------------------------------------

Tifa looked from face to face as Cloud came down the stairs, pondering 
on why Aerith&#39;s face looked so strained, but after being told the news 
that Cait was a spy, she could understand why the trust was broke for 
the Ancient who tried to trust with her entire heart and soul.

But a splintering thorn in her heart needled, that jealousy ugly that 
Aerith had been on a date with Cloud. With Cloud. Cloud, Cloud, 
fluffikins himself, spikey haired jerk... no! Bad anger...

I wish it&#39;d calm down. It was just a date, nothing happened. If I&#39;d been 
well enough, I would have taken her on one.

Instead of looking ashamed, the spy himself, sat quite comfortably, 
speaking up in his accent so it drew all angry eyes. &quot;What took you so 
long, Cloud? Oh yeah, about the Temple of the Ancients. I think if we 
take the Tiny Bronco East towards the sea, we should be able to find it. 
Well then, shall we get goin&#39;? Who&#39;s gonna go?&quot;

Aerith lifted a wavering hand, &quot;I&#39;m going for sure.&quot;

The natural choice.

Then she lifted her hand. This way, there&#39;d be no chance for funny 
business of Cloud muscling in on her territory. A simply genius plan 
that made her smile, &quot;I&#39;ll go too.&quot;

&quot;Tifa,&quot; Aerith said softly.

&quot;I&#39;m all better now, after all. Time I started helping out.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s settled then,&quot; Cait said, &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;

-----------------------------------------------

The power of the Ancients.

The mystic ties that bind them to the land that never was, and the land 
that no longer is. There are worlds beyond mention, and as a race they 
were migrating from one to the next and moving them into adulthood from 
infancy, raising the voice of the Planet and helping it to survive. The 
Cetra, they are the last bastion of hope against the darkness that fills 
the universe, which chokes life.

She is Ancient.

She is Cetra.

She is beautiful and she is life.

She, she is all that is good in the world.

He, however, is all that is my nightmares. With his silver hair, he is 
the evil in the corner of my locked up heart, the wound in my soul and 
the scar on my skin, ugly, and disfiguring. If I knew how to rid myself 
of him, I would.

But as she sat there, looking strained, looking worried, what was I to 
do?

I came with you because I belong at your side.

Because you are my light, Aerith.

...and because I&#39;m your hero.</pre>
