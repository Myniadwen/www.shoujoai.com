&#147;So, you think that the kid had a seizure from the bright light on the 
screen.&#148;

&#147;That is our theory.&#148;

&#147;So he just didn&#146;t wake up?&#148;

&#147;Make sense?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s possible.&#148;

(Sunday, May12) New King Penguin Park:

Amber&#146;s car pulls up to the sidewalk and she jumps out (wearing the 
pink sweater).  After closing the door, she runs into the park, 
heading for the slide.


King Penguin Slide: Inside:

&#147;Why, why, why&#148; Spin mumbles, holding her knees to her chest.  She ran 
here from Tifa&#146;s (a good 5 blocks) and sat in her for about an hour. 
The whole time she has been there was she crying out, and now was no 
different.  &#147;Why does no body love me?&#148;  She shoves her fist into the 
wall and cries more.  &#147;No one loves me!&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s not true&#148; a voice calls from outside.  Spin looks out to find 
who was speaking to her, and her eyes meet with hers, with Ambers.

&#147;You don&#146;t love me&#148; She yells at the soaked girl, &#147;That is why you&#146;re 
wearing my sweater in the rain!&#148;

&#147;No, I am wearing it for you, to remember you&#148; Amber explains while 
making her way up the slide.

&#147;No stay away, I hate you!&#148; Screams Spin, as she swings wildly at 
Amber.

&#147;It will be okay,&#148; she reassures Spin, while shrugging off the pain of 
the stronger woman&#146;s fist hitting her sides, &#147;It will be okay.&#148;  
Finally she gets a hold of her, bringing her into a tight embrace.  &#147;I 
love you.&#148;  Hearing those words Spin collapses into her arms.  They 
both fall over and slide down the slide (Head first) and they land in 
a puddle at the bottom.  &#147;Hey, lets go to the car.&#148;

Their Apartment Building:

Amber walked in, soaked to the bone, with an equally wet Spin on her 
back.  As she make her way towards elevator people around her make 
comments about how they&#146;re happy those tow are back together.   
Finally she makes it to the elevator and gets on (with people staring) 
and they ride up to their floor.  After so long it is no longer her 
apartment anymore, it&#146;s theirs again.  

&#147;I love you&#133;&#148;

&#147;Now you will pay for what you have done,&#148; a female voice sounds.

&#147;But I have done nothing to you, I am no longer with you,&#146;&quot; Tidus 
reasons.

&#147;It tis your&#146; fault that we are disgraced,&#148; the female voice yells 
(though still sounding mellow), now you will pay!&#148;

Mortality-

What is being a mortal?

Is it possible for one to live forever?

I have another question,

Are dreams a mortal thing.

Truthfully your mortal life is no more than a dream.

Your mortal life a dream that flashes just before you die.
