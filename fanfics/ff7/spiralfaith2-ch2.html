	&#147;No Doctor, but we can&#146;t keep this up forever.&#148;

	&#147;Law states we can&#146;t pull the plug without a guardians
permission.&#148;
_____________________________________________________

(May 26)  Amber and Spin&#146;s apartment:

	Amber opens the door to allow access to the house to the
limping Spin.  &#147;Thank you Amber.&#148;

	&#147;Don&#146;t thank me Spin, you are injured.&#148;

	&#147;I am hurt aren&#146;t I&#148; Spin replies, plopping herself down on
the couch only to have Amber walk over and pull her back up.
&#147;Ow, hey, what are you doin!&#148; yells Spin loudly after having
Amber touch one of her still hurting wounds.

	&#147;Can&#146;t have you laying on the couch,&#148; Amber explains,
yanking her girl into the bedroom.  &#147;You are hurt and have to stay
in here,&#148; Amber shoves Spin onto the bed (gently), &#147;Sooo, that
means I am at your&#146; every whim.&#148;

	&#147;Really,&#148; Spin coos with an evil grin, &#147;anything.&#148;

	Amber picks up Spin&#146;s foot and takes off her shoes and
socks, &#147;no sex though.&#148;  Spin lets out a loud sigh then lifts her
torso up to look at her lover, Amber whom is currently removing
her other sock.  &#147;You know just because I am hurt don&#146;t mean I
can&#146;t take off my shoes and socks.&#148;

	&#147;I know, but, now you&#146;re in my care,&#147; Amber explains,
removing her sock completely before laying Spin back down,
&#147;and I&#146;m gonna spoil my baby.&#148;	With that said Amber gets up on
the bed (on all fours) and starts to move up towards Spin (nearing
her mouth to Spin&#146;s) causing Spin to move, and squirm under her.

	&#147;I thought there is no sex aloud,&#148; notes Spin.

	Amber sigh then gets off the bed, &#147;almost forgot.&#148;

	&#147;No, it&#146;s okay, look I am fine, ow,&#148; she sets back down
after trying to get up.

Tifa and Yuffie&#146;s apartment:

	&#147;Later Miss Guardian,&#148; Yuffie says sarcastically, exiting
the apartment to go to school.

	Tifa just sighs at her little lovers obsession with calling her
&#145;Miss Guardian&#146; or &#145;Guardian Lady&#146;.  She is just going to have to
let her it seems.  &#147;Man, she&#146;s never going to quit.&#148;  She sighs one
more time before getting back to work.	&#147;So, how can I possibly
get Zero to go back to the &#145;Waking Realm&#146;&#148; she thinks aloud,
&#147;and what if when I find the solution, and I can only talk to Kerek
(sigh), this is pointless.&#148;  She pulls out her notes (which is nothing
but a blank notebook), &#147;Man I haven&#146;t had a good start so far.&#148;
&#147;Hell,&#148; she yells loudly, slamming her hand (open palm) into the
table, &#147; Never going to figure this out, am I!&#148;

New King Penguin Park: Walking Trail:

	Amber walks down the trail (dragging Spin with her).  &#147;I
can walk on my own,&#148; whines Spin.

	&#147;No you can&#146;t,&#148; sighs Amber, &#147;and anyway, you usually
like me carrying you.&#148;

	Spin looks at her, and then realizes that it is true.  &#147;But it&#146;s
not the same right now,&#148; She sighs (and then grips Amber tightly
as two male runners run by), &#147;I feel like you are doin it because I
am a cripple.&#148;

	&#147;That is only part of it.&#148;  Amber looks and her injured
friend (lover) and notices how tightly Spin is holding.  &#147;Why do
you always grab me tightly when ever a man walks by.&#148;

	&#147;Because I am afraid that they&#146;ll steal you from me.&#148;

	Amber sighs loudly, &#147;Spin are you ever gonna forget about
that little thing between me and Yuffie, I am sorry okay!&#148;

	&#147;What?&#148; exclaims Spin, &#147;I wasn&#146;t talking about that,&#148;

	&#147;Uhh, then what?&#148;

	&#147;I am just paranoid.&#148;

	&#147;Oh, Spin, how cute.&#148;

Tifa and Yuffie&#146;s love shake (J):

	&#147;So, Tifa, I am sorry, but I have ta&#146; do this, I&#146;ll remember
you there&#148; says the answering machine.

	&#147;No, Zero!&#148;



&#147;I&#146;ll be here.. so if you come here you&#146;ll find me.&#148;  Squall, FFVIII

Authors Notes:

Heh Heeh.  What is gonna happen next?  I don&#146;t know.  Actually I
do.  You know, right now I am watching Pokemon, and I have to
say I am disappointed.	You know, the animation is good, as are
the voice-overs.  But c&#146;mon they butchered the fights.	They just
ain&#146;t doin the games justice (I mean red threw crystal, ruby and
sapphire blow).  My point is, they can do better (look at the
movie, it ruled).  Ahh, why me!!  Anyway, read the next chapter.
