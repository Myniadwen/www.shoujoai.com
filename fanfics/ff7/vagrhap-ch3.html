<h1>Vagrants Rhapsody (part 3 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/pnkpanther9.html">PnkPanther9</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff7/vagrhap-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>They awoke later in the morning groggy and disoriented.  Hair tussled 
and mussed, Tifa and Yuffie came out of their bedrooms at the same time, 
muttering &#39;good mornings&#39; as they shuffled down the hall.  Pausing at 
the bathroom, they looked to one another for a moment before the fighter 
gestured for the ninja to go on.  The girl smiled her thanks, shuffling 
into the bathroom with a yawn.  Tifa continued past the bathroom into 
the kitchen, where she proceeded to make breakfast.

Feeling the need to expand on things a bit, she set out to make 
pancakes, taking out the necessary bowls and ingredients to make the 
batter.  A moment later, Yuffie joined her in the kitchen, seating 
herself at the table.  &quot;Ooh!  What&#39;cha gonna make, Tif?&quot;

&quot;Pancakes...Is that all right?&quot;

Yuffie grinned.  &quot;Can&#39;t wait.  I&#39;m starving!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s good, cuz I never make a few pancakes.&quot; Tifa began to mix the 
batter.  Glancing back at Yuffie, she asked, &quot;Where do you plan on going 
to next?&quot;

Yuffie shrugged fiddling with the beer cap Tifa had tossed onto the 
table earlier that morning.  &quot;I&#39;ll stop by Cid&#39;s I suppose...but I dun&#39; 
wanna impose on &#39;em.  I&#39;m annoying enough.  Imagine someone trying to 
take care of a baby with me around!&quot;

Tifa frowned slightly.  &quot;Yuffie, you&#39;re not annoying.&quot;

Yuffie grinned, &quot;Nice of you to say, Tif, but we both know that isn&#39;t 
true.&quot;

&quot;Well...all right, you can be a bit of a pain sometimes&#151;&quot;

&quot;Hey, you weren&#39;t supposed to agree with me!&quot;

&quot;&#39;Re-lax&#39;!&quot; Tifa mimicked, glancing at the younger girl over her 
shoulder with a grin.  &quot;I was only kidding.&quot;

Yuffie stuck her tongue out at her.  &quot;Big breasted jerk.&quot; She mumbled.

&quot;Pesky thieving runt.&quot; Tifa returned with a laugh.

The ninja ran a hand through her hair, smiling softly.  &quot;Sooo...&quot; she 
propped her feet up on another chair.  &quot;We&#39;re going to that festival 
today, right?&quot;

Tifa sighed.  &quot;Yeah...sure.  Why not.&quot;

&quot;Great!&quot; Yuffie said with a genuine smile.  &quot;It&#39;ll be fun, you&#39;ll see!&quot;

&quot;Yeah loads of fun...&quot; Tifa grumbled.

Soon the pancakes were ready, and setting out the syrup, butter, and 
whipped cream, the two began to eat.  The ninja hadn&#39;t lied when she 
said she was hungry, for she consumed her first three pancakes with such 
zeal and voracious enthusiasm that Tifa couldn&#39;t help but stare.

When all the pancakes were gone, Tifa stood to clear the table, however, 
Yuffie waved her off.  &quot;Go on.  I&#39;ll take care of this.  It&#39;s a 
fifty-fifty deal.  You cook, I clean.&quot;

Tifa blinked rapidly, &quot;Um, thank you, Yuffie, but you don&#39;t have to&#151;&quot;

&quot;&#39;Course I do!&quot; the girl said, proceeding to clear the table.

Tifa nodded and muttered her thanks choosing to lean against the counter 
as she watched Yuffie work.  That had certainly been unexpected.  The 
ninja had never offered to do such things before, as far as Tifa 
remembered.  &quot;Time&#39;s have changed.&quot; Tifa said with a small sigh.

Yuffie glanced at her sharply.  &quot;Geez, come on, Tif.  You&#39;re starting to 
sound old!&quot;

&quot;I feel old.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re only...what?  Twenty-four?  You&#39;re so not old!&quot;

&quot;Twenty-three actually.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, like I said, you&#39;re not old.&quot;

Tifa smiled absently.  Glancing at the clock on the wall, she frowned 
softly.  &quot;I guess we should get ready if we want to get to that crafts 
festival early.&quot;

Yuffie frowned as she looked up from washing a plate.  &quot;What&#39;s the 
rush?&quot;

&quot;I like being early...plus, we&#39;ll have first pick on what they have to 
sell.&quot;

Yuffie nodded.  &quot;You go ahead and get ready, I&#39;ll finish this.&quot;

&quot;You sure you don&#39;t want me to help?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t be a good house guest if I told you &#39;yes&#39;.&quot;

&quot;All right...&quot; Tifa said shoving off of the counter and going to her 
room.  There she chose a pair of dark shorts, a black tank top, and a 
navy blue vest.  Slipping on a pair of sneakers, she snagged a hair-tie 
from her bedside table and pulled her hair back into a messy ponytail.  
Going back to the kitchen, she saw that Yuffie had finished and had gone 
back to her room to change.

Biting her lip, Tifa glanced back at the hall for a moment before going 
into the garage, flicking the light on as she opened the door.  The 
truck, with its paint peeling, mud and dirt covered body illuminated by 
the dull light of the overhanging light-bulb, Tifa felt a sense of loss 
and longing wash over her.  A deep-rooted filling that squirmed in her 
gut, tightening her throat, and causing her eyes to turn overcast.

&quot;You&#39;re never gonna work...&quot; Tifa breathed, disdain creeping into her 
voice as her face turned cold.

&quot;Tifa, what&#39;re you doing?&quot;

Tifa jumped at the sound of Yuffie&#39;s voice behind her.  Turning, the 
fighter glared.  &quot;Geez, Yuffie!  Why do you have to keep scaring me like 
that?&quot;

Yuffie held her hands up with a smirk,  &quot;Hey, hey, hey!  You&#39;re the one 
who&#39;s rusty!  I&#39;m a ninja, remember?  You can&#39;t forget these things, 
Tif!&quot;

Tifa rolled her eyes.  &quot;You ready?&quot;

Yuffie was dressed in her old khaki shorts, the material frayed and 
worn, and her old orange sneakers, which looked ready to fall apart.  
Her shirt was a yellow tee that, again, cut above the navel.  She wore 
her old orange gloves and thrown over her shirt was a long beige jacket 
whose sleeves cut at the elbows.

Tifa raised an eyebrow.  &quot;You&#39;ve got a thing for your belly button, 
don&#39;t you?&quot;

Yuffie grinned, lifting her shirt some.  &quot;&#39;Course I do!  It&#39;s just so 
darned cute!  Don&#39;t you think?&quot;

The fighter rolled her eyes as she grabbed her purse from the kitchen 
table.  &quot;Come on, the town square isn&#39;t that far off.  Just a few blocks 
or so.&quot;

The two left the house, Tifa leading and Yuffie following.  The morning 
was clear and bright, the sunlight turning dewdrops into diamonds.  The 
two women were a sight to see, should any of the citizens of Tiesmire 
glance out their windows as they walked by.  The ninja, feeling playful, 
took to balancing on the curb.  She held both her arms out at her sides 
so as to keep her balance.  &quot;Hey, Tifa!&quot;

Tifa glanced back at her.  Seeing what Yuffie was doing, the woman 
smirked slightly.  &quot;Kinda big to do that, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

&quot;Yer just jealous cuz your rusty.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna call you from 
now on.  Rusty.  Come on, Rusty.  Let&#39;s see you do this!&quot; the girl 
taunted.

Tifa tongued her cheek, &quot;All right, here, watch this, Ms. Fancy Feet.&quot; 
the woman stepped onto the curb, placing one foot after the other as she 
balanced herself with her arms.  &quot;Easy!&quot; she exclaimed.

Grinning like a devil, Yuffie gave Tifa a slight shove from behind.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Tifa cried, struggling to keep from falling off the curb.  &quot;That 
isn&#39;t fair!&quot;

Yuffie cackled, &quot;Life ain&#39;t fair, sweetheart!&quot;

&quot;Tell me about it.&quot; Tifa said, shaking her head, but she was grinning.

They continued like that until they reached the town square.  They 
earned many stares from the other early festivalgoers, but the two were 
in high spirits and were not deterred by the judgmental looks.  As they 
neared the end of the curb, Yuffie lost balance and slipped off, 
stumbling in an attempt to regain composure.  Tifa went to her aid, 
grabbing her arm so that she steadied.  &quot;You okay?&quot; the woman asked.

The ninja nodded, a mildly surprised look on her face.  But that quickly 
disappeared as a smile spread across her face.  &quot;Guess you&#39;re not so 
rusty after all, Rusty.&quot;

Tifa laughed and gave Yuffie a playful shove.

Turning she stopped as she spotted Smithly and his wife near one of the 
booths.  The man waved to her, and she waved back, smiling sheepishly.  
Yuffie, seeing whom she was waving to, grabbed her hand, &quot;Come on!  
Introduce me!&quot;

Sputtering, Tifa cried, &quot;Hey--!&quot; but she could only sigh in resignation 
as the young girl dragged her to the elderly couple.  Smiling politely, 
Tifa nodded to them both.  &quot;Mr. Smithly, Mrs. Smithly.  How are you two 
this morning?&quot; they nodded in turn.  

&quot;Fine, just fine.&quot; Mr. Smithly said.  He gestured to Yuffie, &quot;And who is 
this lovely young lady with you?&quot;

&quot;Yuffie Kisaragi, at your service!&quot; Yuffie stuck her hand out, and 
Smithly shook it, chuckling in amusement.  &quot;Ah...I&#39;ve heard a lot about 
you.&quot;

&quot;Only half of its true,&quot; Yuffie said with a wink.

Smithly chuckled again.

Mrs. Smithly, her gray hair covered by a black shawl, extended her hand, 
smiling sweetly.  &quot;Mrs. Smithly.  Pleased to meet you dear.&quot;

&quot;Right back at ya.&quot; Yuffie said, shaking her hand firmly.

Tifa, clearing her throat, nudged Yuffie with her elbow.  &quot;If you&#39;ll 
excuse us, Mr. Smithly, Mrs. Smithly.&quot; She nodded to them, Yuffie giving 
them a wave as they walked away.

The festival was already beginning to thrum with life as people came, 
walking between booths.  The air was filled with a small din, laughter 
and conversations clashing into one another in an ambience of sound.  
Tifa and Yuffie stuck close together as they maneuvered through the 
thickening crowd...however, only one of them was nervous.

Tifa didn&#39;t realize how used to being alone she had become, and this 
truth didn&#39;t become blatantly apparent until now, stuck here in a place 
of deep social connection.  The noises and activity made the fighter&#39;s 
stomach turn to knots.  Before, this type of atmosphere was a distant 
memory that had paled and withered over time.  Now, however, it was all 
around her, pulsating and moving and changing.  Tifa found herself 
unconsciously grabbing Yuffie&#39;s arm and stepping even closer to her.

The ninja, feeling the tension in the woman&#39;s touch, turned to look at 
her companion with an inquisitive look.  Seeing that she was preoccupied 
with all that was going around her, the girl decided to get the woman&#39;s 
attention a different way.

&quot;Geez, Tifa.  Look, I know I&#39;m hot n&#39; all, but can&#39;t we wait till we&#39;re 
some place private?&quot;

Tifa&#39;s eyes snapped onto Yuffie&#39;s face, her cheeks immediately flaming.  
&quot;W-What?&quot;  Then, looking down at her hands, she quickly let go of the 
ninja&#39;s arm.  &quot;Sorry...&quot; she mumbled.

Yuffie shrugged.  &quot;I didn&#39;t mind that.  It was just that you seemed 
tense.&quot;

Tifa bit her lip as she looked around her.  &quot;I&#39;m not used to this.&quot; She 
said quietly.

&quot;And you say you&#39;re not a hermit...&quot; the younger girl rolled her eyes.  
&quot;Come on.&quot; Grabbing her hand, Yuffie led Tifa to one of the nearby 
booths.  &quot;We&#39;ll cycle around, m&#39;kay?  Don&#39;t look so twitchy.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not twitchy!&quot; Tifa exclaimed, earning herself some looks from those 
around her.  Hunching her shoulders some, the woman moved to the other 
side of the booth.

One by one, Yuffie and Tifa visited each booth, examining what each 
vendor had to offer.  Both admired the creative trinkets each vendor 
displayed, their skill in craftsmanship shown in the designs and 
assembly of their goods.  Yuffie always spent a little more time on the 
jewelry, her eyes turning wide at the sight of bracelets and rings.  It 
was at one particular jewelry booth, that Yuffie picked out a necklace.

This necklace, with its thin silver chain, had a pendant of a butterfly, 
it&#39;s wings decorated with what looked like obsidian.  &quot;Tifa!&quot; the ninja 
cried, holding the necklace up to the fighter.  &quot;This is perfect for 
you!&quot;

Tifa took the pendant in between her fingers.  &quot;It&#39;s pretty.&quot; The woman 
said, smiling softly.

Yuffie held the necklace up higher, screwing her face up as she examined 
it.  Then, glancing once at Tifa, she said.  &quot;I&#39;m buying this for you.&quot;

At this, the woman glanced at her sharply.  &quot;What?&quot;

Yuffie ignored her and turned to the vendor, reaching into her back 
pocket.  &quot;I&#39;ll take this, please.&quot;

&quot;But Yuffie&#151;&quot;

&quot;Shush!&quot; The ninja said, as she handed the money.  Unhooking the 
necklace, she held it up.  &quot;C&#39;mere.&quot;

&quot;Yuffie&#151;&quot;

Yuffie stamped her foot.  &quot;C&#39;mere, Rusty!  Or I&#39;ll pop you in the lip.&quot;

Tifa sighed as she stepped toward the girl.  &quot;That&#39;s one way to put a 
necklace on somebody...&quot; she grumbled.

&quot;Hair please.&quot;

Tifa lifted her hair and Yuffie stepped forward, reaching around her 
neck.  &quot;Stupid hook...&quot; the girl muttered as she fumbled with the 
necklace.

The fighter stiffened at the feel of the girl&#39;s breath against her neck.  
Biting her lip at the light contact the ninja&#39;s finger&#39;s made against 
her skin, Tifa tried to distract herself with something else.

When Yuffie stepped away, Tifa was positively red in the face.

&quot;It looks good on you!  Beautiful in fact!&quot; the ninja said proudly, 
placing her hands high on her hips.

Tifa only muttered a small &#39;thank you&#39; as she crossed her arms.

Not noticing her companion&#39;s discomfort, Yuffie turned and her eyes 
brightened.  &quot;Oh look!  There&#39;s a band setting up over there!&quot;

Tifa looked in the direction Yuffie was looking.  &quot;Well there&#39;s the 
music Smithly promised...&quot;

Yuffie grabbed Tifa&#39;s hand.  &quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go see what they&#39;re gonna 
play.&quot;

Learning there was no use in fighting, Tifa allowed the younger girl to 
drag her clear across the town square to where the band was preparing to 
perform.  A crowd was already forming around them.  Worming their way 
into the heart of the crowd, Yuffie tapped her foot impatiently whilst 
Tifa glanced around her anxiously.

One of the band members tapped the microphone, getting a slight feedback 
as he did so.  Speaking into the mic, he muttered.  &quot;Testing, 
testing...&quot; When all seemed to check out, he waved to the crowd and 
smiled.  &quot;Howdy folks!&quot;

The crowd answered him back simultaneously and his smile widened.  &quot;Nice 
to see y&#39;all here today.  Well my name&#39;s Orvan and I&#39;m the lead singer 
and one of the guitarists for our lil&#39; band, Meteor!&quot;

&quot;Catchy name...&quot; Tifa grumbled.

&#39;Orvan&#39; proceeded to introduce the rest of the band.  There was &#39;Edgar&#39; 
the bassist, &#39;Neal&#39; the drummer, and &#39;Bob&#39; the other guitarist.

Yuffie giggled at the last name.  &quot;Heh...&#39;Bob&#39;.&quot;

Tifa gave her a weird look.

&quot;Now here&#39;s a little number,&quot; Orvan began, &quot;That I&#39;m sure a lot of you 
will recognize.&quot;

He strummed a few notes on his guitar and Tifa&#39;s ears perked at the 
melody.  &quot;Hey, isn&#39;t that-&quot;

&quot;OHMIGOD!!&quot;  Yuffie jumped into the air.  &quot;Yes!  Yes!!&quot;

Other young girls joined in her glee, while the male portion of the 
crowd groaned collectively.  Tifa, bewildered, watched as those around 
her began to dance and move.  Yuffie turned to her, and the fighter 
paled.

&quot;Let&#39;s dance, Tifa!&quot; the girl exclaimed, already bopping to the beat and 
music the band made.

&quot;Uh...Yuffie I think I&#39;ll sit this one out...&quot;

Yuffie glared at her.  &quot;Tif, yer borin&#39; me!  Now come on!  Don&#39;t you 
know how to dance??&quot;

&quot;Of course I do!&quot; Tifa said, sounding indignant.  &quot;It&#39;s just...&quot;

Yuffie grabbed her shoulders and shook her.  &quot;Stop thinking so much and 
move!  Get your mind off that truck!  Forget about time!  Just dance 
will you?&quot;

Sputtering, Tifa didn&#39;t fight as the other girl grabbed her hand and 
twirled her about.  &quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; the ninja said, laughing.

Tifa began to sway her hips to the beat, only slightly at first, then 
more and more as the song progressed.  A smile grew on her face as her 
movements matched those around her.  People gave wide berth to what they 
could only perceive as two beautiful women having fun and dancing their 
hearts out.

&quot;&#39;Take destiny and chance and you&#39;ll find the romance of the ages, 
locked within steel cages, separate, until you set them free, so come 
with me...Come with me!&#39;&quot;

The music was different from the original song.  It was much more raw.  
Faster, less dreamy, and more energized.  Tifa found she liked this 
grungy, adrenaline-fueled version of the song better opposed to the 
original&#39;s slower, techno pumped version.  The music, which pulsated 
from the speakers and amps, seemed to flow out and wash the crowd in its 
essence.  It drowned Tifa, filling her chest and head with a light 
headed abandon that caused her to close her eyes and throw her hands up 
in the air.

And then, just like that.  The song was over.

The crowd, coming out of its trance, clapped and cheered their 
appreciation.  Yuffie, pink faced and out of breath, looked to Tifa, who 
was in a similar state.  The girl was looking at her with what seemed to 
be admiration and joy.  &quot;Wow, Tif.  You really got into it, didn&#39;t you?  
See!  You had fun!&quot;

Tifa, smiling meekly, nodded.

The rest of the day was spent dancing to Meteor&#39;s music, the butterfly 
necklace swinging from around Tifa&#39;s neck and glinting in the sunlight.
