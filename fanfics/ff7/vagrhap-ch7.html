<h1>Vagrants Rhapsody (part 7 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff7/index.html">Final Fantasy  7</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/pnkpanther9.html">PnkPanther9</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff7/vagrhap-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>A stream of blaring horns and gleaming metal, the streets of Corel were 
in constant movement. There were a lot of trucks coming in from the 
highway, so when Yuffie and Tifa entered the city limits, they were 
overshadowed by the looming vehicles. Eyes wide as she watched the 
truck, Tifa clutched Yuffie tighter around the waist.

The trip through the mountains, though beautiful, was largely 
uneventful. Tifa was revealed to have left them, for the height made her 
ears pop, and while she was starting to get used to riding the 
motorbike, it still didn&#39;t add to her comfort.

At a stop, Yuffie glanced around before accelerating forward again. She 
was cut off by a car, which blared its horn at her as it zoomed past. 
Yuffie shook her fist after the driver, shouting, &quot;You lousy jerk!&quot; The 
cars behind her began to honk as well, the looks on the drivers faces 
screwed up in annoyance. Squaring her jaw, the young ninja lifted her 
hand and, without looking back, extended her middle finger.

Tifa blanched as the honking increased at this gesture, the young girl 
she was clutching to speeding off again with the squeal of her tires, 
leaving the angry drivers behind with their noise. &quot;Was that really 
necessary?&quot; Tifa shouted, a disgruntled look on her face. Yuffie turned 
her head slightly. &quot;Sure it was! We&#39;re in a real city now, Tif. Didn&#39;t 
you have to get tough with people back in Midgar?&quot;

&quot;People weren&#39;t like that in the slums. At least...not where I lived.&quot;

&quot;Meh, well where you lived, you couldn&#39;t call that a normal city. This 
here--&quot; She swerved slightly as another biker zoomed past her. 
&quot;Asshole!&quot; the ninja screamed. Turning back to Tifa, the girl raised an 
eyebrow. &quot;Is a genuine dog-eat-dog environment.&quot;

Tifa sighed. &quot;Yeah...I can already see that.&quot;

Not long after the woman said this, Yuffie began to pull into a gas 
station. Parking in front of the mini-mart, the ninja turned off her 
bike and took off her helmet. &quot;Hold on a minute, Tif. I need to get 
directions for Barret&#39;s house.&quot;

The woman frowned. &quot;Why? I know the street he lives on.&quot;

Yuffie turned back to her. &quot;And do you know how to get to that street?&quot;

At this the woman faltered. &quot;Er...well...no.&quot;

Yuffie smirked. &quot;So like I said: I&#39;m getting directions.&quot;

Tifa, feeling somewhat foolish, took the helmet off of her head. Next to 
her, a red sports car was parked, the man sitting in it wearing 
sunglasses and a button up shirt with the top three buttons undone. A 
cigarette held in between the fingers on his right hand, he leaned his 
arm out as reclined in his seat.

Tifa leaned forward, planting her elbows in the spot where Yuffie sat. 
With this movement, the man glanced at her from behind his shades, one 
eyebrow quirking slightly as his eyes roved over the curve of Tifa&#39;s 
back.

&quot;Hey there!&quot; the man said casually.

Tifa turned to him with a jerk, moving as if she were going to sit up 
again.

The man smiled lazily at her, showing his bright teeth. &quot;How ya doin?&quot;

For a moment the woman didn&#39;t say anything, just sat there frowning at 
him. Then, after a moment, she relaxed again and shrugged, choosing to 
stare at the handlebars of the motorbike. &quot;I&#39;m doing fine.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s good.&quot; the man took a drag of his cigarette, leaning his hand 
out the window again. He blew a stream of smoke into the air.

Inwardly, Tifa rolled her eyes at the man&#39;s attempt at being alluring.

&quot;Where ya from?&quot; the man asked after a moment, taking another drag of 
his cigarette.

&quot;Not here.&quot; Tifa said shortly. Looking to the glass doors of the mart, 
the woman wondered impatiently when Yuffie would get back.

The man turned to her, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m just trying to start an innocent 
conversation.&quot;

&quot;Is that so?&quot; Tifa looked at the man and stopped when she realized that 
he was actually handsome.

&quot;Yeah. That&#39;s so,&quot; the man said lowering his shades some. He had blue 
eyes. &quot;You look familiar...what&#39;s your name?&quot;

Tifa raised an eyebrow, &quot;You never tell a girl you wanna get with that 
they&#39;re familiar.&quot;

The man chuckled; smoke puffing out of his mouth in large clouds as he 
did so. Running a hand through his wavy brown hair he said, &quot;So you 
think I wanna get with you?&quot;

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t talk randomly to strangers, especially women, if you 
weren&#39;t interested in them.&quot;

&quot;How do you know? You don&#39;t even know me.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t need to know you intimately to know that you&#39;ve been with a lot 
of women, that you work in laborious jobs, and that you like gambling.&quot;

The man blinked at her, slowly taking off his glasses. &quot;And how&#39;d you 
deduce all that in the few words I exchanged with you, missy?&quot;

Tifa smiled absently. She nodded to his hand. &quot;Those hands are the hands 
of a man who does heavy lifting and field work. The statue of Choco and 
Mog you&#39;ve got sitting on your dashboard shows me that you believe a lot 
in luck...plus it helps that Gold Saucer is nearby. I&#39;m guessing you 
just came from there?&quot;

The man smirked. &quot;Yeah, I did.&quot;

&quot;Win much?&quot;

&quot;A ton.&quot;

Tifa&#39;s smile widened. &quot;Congratulations.&quot;

&quot;And how do you know I&#39;ve been with a lot of women?&quot;

Tifa shrugged. &quot;Easy. Because you&#39;re talking to me now, and just a 
moment ago, you had the gall to say I looked familiar.&quot;

&quot;Why&#39;s it bad to say that?&quot;

&quot;Because, you&#39;ve most likely never met me before in your life, and for 
you to say that to me makes you out to be some sleazy guy who&#39;s slept 
with a ton of girls whom you can&#39;t even keep track of...And also the 
fact that, if you DID meet me at some time in your life, you don&#39;t 
remember me by name. That&#39;s very insulting.&quot;

The man blinked. &quot;Boy...never thought of it that way.&quot;

&quot;Men normally don&#39;t.&quot; Tifa returned her gaze to the motorbike&#39;s 
handlebars.

&quot;Well...you know, I didn&#39;t mean any harm by saying that. It&#39;s just...you 
look like someone famous. ...Are you?&quot;

&quot;What are the chances that I&#39;m famous?&quot;

&quot;One in a billion.&quot;

Tifa glanced at the man again. &quot;Exactly.&quot;

&quot;You gonna tell me your name?&quot;

&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so.&quot;

&quot;Well...my name&#39;s Chauncey. Nice to meet ya, Jane Doe.&quot;

The mini-mart&#39;s doors opened and Yuffie stepped out, her head turned 
back toward the cashier whom she had been talking to. &quot;Thanks pal!&quot; 
Smiling, she turned, but stopped at the sight of Tifa and the man 
talking.

Tifa looked up at her and straightened up, &quot;Hey Yuffie.&quot;

&quot;Hey...&quot; Yuffie said, hesitating as she looked between Tifa and the man. 
The man leaned back in his seat, smirking at her. &quot;Hey there, kid.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t call me kid.&quot; The ninja snapped, eyeing the man piercingly.

Tifa frowned at her as she strapped her helmet on again. &quot;Yuffie?&quot;

The man glanced at the clock on his dashboard. &quot;Welp, ladies. Nice 
meeting the both of ya. I&#39;m off to Costa del Sol to celebrate my 
winnings.&quot; He started up his car. Putting on his glasses again, he 
flashed a smile at Tifa. &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll see ya again, missy?&quot;

Tifa raised an eyebrow at him, but smiled nonetheless as he pulled away, 
leaving the gas station and disappearing into the traffic.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t let creeps like that hit on you, Tifa.&quot; Yuffie said once 
the man was out of sight. She took her helmet and strapped it on as she 
glared at the woman in reprimand. Tifa returned the glare. &quot;Yuffie, I&#39;ve 
run a bar in the Midgar slums. I think I know how to handle myself.&quot;

Yuffie didn&#39;t say anything to this. Sitting in front of Tifa, the ninja 
turned on the motorbike silently. Leaving the gas station the two 
entered traffic, blending into the river of cars as they went on their 
way.

Tifa, her arms around Yuffie&#39;s waist as always, noticed a slight tension 
in the girl. Frowning, the woman thought, with some annoyance, &quot;What&#39;s 
her problem?&quot;

It was when they reached the other side of the city, where the larger 
houses resided, that Yuffie slowed down. Entering a street named 
&#39;Eichenburger&#39;, the girl said, without turning her head. &quot;This is the 
street.&quot;

Tifa turned her head as she began to check the house numbers. 
&quot;3456...3457...He&#39;s farther down.&quot;

Yuffie pressed down on the accelerator some, and they sped up. She 
slowed down again after a short distance.

Tifa turned her head again. &quot;3469...3470...3471...That&#39;s it!&quot;

Yuffie pulled over, and the two got off the bike, taking off their 
helmets. The house was a large white two-story, complete with a garage. 
The driveway was empty and the shades pulled shut.

&quot;Seems like no one&#39;s home.&quot;

&quot;This street is like a frickin&#39; ghost town...&quot; Yuffie muttered uneasily, 
glancing up and down at the other houses. No one was outside.

&quot;Come on...&quot; Tifa said, opening the fence gate and moving down the path 
to the door. Yuffie followed her, shutting the gate after her.

Licking her lips, the woman knocked timidly on the door. No answer. 
Frowning, the woman knocked on the door again. Still no answer.

Rolling her eyes, Yuffie shoved her aside slightly and pounded on the 
door hard. &quot;Oi! Old man! Open up, already!&quot;

Tifa stared at her. &quot;Yuffie, what the hell do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot;

The ninja gave the woman a look. &quot;No one&#39;s going to hear those doortaps 
of yours, Tifa.&quot;

Tifa opened her mouth to say something, but just then, the door opened.

A young girl that reached a little past Tifa&#39;s waist looked up at them 
both, eyes fluttering as she examined their faces. Then her face lit up 
and she smiled hugely. &quot;Tifa! Yuffie!&quot;

Tifa bent down slightly, &quot;Marlene, is that you?&quot;

The girl laughed slightly as she hugged the older woman around the 
shoulders. &quot;Yep! It&#39;s me!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m surprised you remember me, kid!&quot; Yuffie placed her hands high on 
her hips, a smirk on her face.

Marlene looked up at her with a grin. &quot;Of course I&#39;d remember you! Daddy 
used to complain about you all the time!&quot;

Yuffie&#39;s cheeks went pink, and her shoulders drooped. &quot;Your dad&#39;s a 
schmuck.&quot; The ninja muttered sorely. Tifa nudged her roughly in the ribs 
with her elbow.

&quot;What&#39;d I tell you about answering the door, Marlene?&quot;

The two froze at the sound of the deep voice. Like a large, looming 
shadow, Barret appeared behind Marlene, his face twisted in a scowl. 
Marlene looked up at her adoptive father. &quot;Daddy, look who&#39;s here!&quot;

&quot;Yeah I can see...&quot; the man said slowly, still glaring at the two.

Unconsciously, both women shrank back.

&quot;Go play in the backyard, sweetie.&quot; Barret said, gently nudging Marlene 
behind him. Confused, the young girl looked at Tifa and Yuffie before 
scampering away. Like a giant wall, Barret stood in his doorway, 
crossing his large arms over his large chest.

Tifa clasped her hands behind her back while Yuffie took to rocking back 
and forth on her heels. &quot;Hello...Barret.&quot; The older woman said meekly, 
glancing up at him before reverting her eyes to the ground.

&quot;&#39;Sup old guy?&quot; Yuffie said, not sounding as timid, however, her caution 
was noticeable.

&quot;The hell&#39;re you two doin&#39; here?&quot; Barret grunted, still glaring.

Tifa bit her lip. &quot;Barret, I know you&#39;re unhappy with me for not 
visiting for so long-&quot;

&quot;Damn straight I am!&quot; the man bellowed, his eyes, if possible, turning 
sharper. &quot;It&#39;s been years, Tifa. What the hell have you been doing all 
this time that&#39;s kept you from stopping by? Unlike me, you ain&#39;t tryin&#39; 
to rebuild no city!&quot;

The fighter sighed. &quot;I...haven&#39;t been doing anything, Barret.&quot;

&quot;That so? Then in this entire time o&#39; doin&#39; nothin&#39;, did it ever cross 
your mind to visit? See how Marlene&#39;s doin&#39;?&quot;

Tifa bowed her head. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Barret.&quot;

The large man turned to Yuffie next. The ninja instinctively shifted her 
left foot back, as if preparing for a fight.

&quot;And what&#39;re you doin&#39; here, brat?&quot;

&quot;We just wanted to visit you, Barret. There isn&#39;t any reason for you to 
be so hostile!&quot;

&quot;Hostile? Hostile? After years of not hearing a damn thing from either 
of you girls, you think I&#39;m just gonna be okay with that?&quot;

Yuffie didn&#39;t say anything, just glared at him defensively.

The man&#39;s eyes flickered back and forth between the two. Then he did 
something neither had expected...especially Yuffie.

He hugged them.

Hard.

Bewildered and, for a second, believing the man was attacking them, 
Yuffie attempted to kick him. This was a little harder to do since he 
lifted them both up into the air at the same time. &quot;G-Get off!&quot; Yuffie 
cried, wriggling. Barret only hugged her tighter. &quot;Shut up, brat! 
Believe it or not, I&#39;ve missed ya!&quot;

Tifa also attempted to fend him off. &quot;Barret...B-Barret! You&#39;re crushing 
my spine!&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t breath...!&quot; Yuffie gasped.

&quot;Man, you guys are drama queens...&quot; Barret released them both, where the 
two landed on the ground stumbling.

&quot;Geez, old man...&quot; Yuffie muttered, rubbing her back. Tifa was doing the 
same, wincing.

Barret chuckled and shook his head. &quot;Consider that my revenge on ya both 
for not visiting in so long!&quot; He stepped aside. &quot;Come in, come in...me 
and Marlene were about to have lunch.&quot;

&quot;I dunno if I can eat anything, it feels like you squished all my 
organs...&quot; Yuffie muttered as she and Tifa entered the house.

----------

&quot;Marlene&#39;s grown so much, I barely recognize her!&quot;

&quot;She looks just like her mother.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;s she doing in school?&quot;

&quot;Real good. Got high grades n&#39; everything.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s fantastic...&quot;

Tifa was sitting with Barret in the dining room, a rather spacious area 
with a large table and a high ceiling, complete with a small chandelier. 
The kitchen itself was something Tifa had often dreamed about while 
running Seventh Heaven. It had all the best modern cooking appliances, 
and managed to look fashionable at the same time. Having taken off her 
shoes, so as not to dirty the carpet, the woman sat cross-legged in her 
seat. Both her and Barret were watching Marlene and Yuffie play soccer 
outside. Yuffie was obviously holding back, but even then Marlene had to 
struggle to keep the ball from her. Both girls were laughing.

Tifa smiled serenely. &quot;You&#39;ve done well for yourself, Barret. This city 
has really grown. It&#39;s hard to believe this is the same Corel we came to 
those few years ago.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Barret took a sip of the beer he had. &quot;Dino helped a lot in 
the first stages. Said it&#39;d benefit us both. After that, things kinda 
jes&#39; kept growing and growing. All we had to do was watch.&quot; The man 
rubbed at the stubble on his chin with his new mechanical arm, something 
he had gotten immediately after Meteor. &quot;Still, these people keep me 
plenty busy with things. They wanted me to be mayor, but I don&#39;t care 
for that political shit...&quot; He took another sip of his beer. Eyeing 
Tifa, Barret asked, &quot;So what&#39;re you two doin&#39;? Going on some kinda road 
trip?&quot;

Tifa nodded, looking out the sliding glass door at the two girls playing 
in the back. &quot;Yeah. From here, we&#39;re gonna head off to Gold Saucer...and 
after that. I dunno. I guess we&#39;ll just go to Costa del Sol.&quot;

Barret nodded. &quot;How is the brat? You two been doing okay? Why&#39;d she 
suddenly wanna go on this trip?&quot;

Tifa frowned slightly, but didn&#39;t turn to look at Barret. Her eyes 
focused on Yuffie, smiling and laughing. &quot;You should stop calling her a 
brat, Barret. I don&#39;t think she appreciates it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do that when she stops calling me &#39;old&#39;.&quot;

&quot;You aren&#39;t still mad at her for what she did during Meteor...are you? 
You know the media has already dehumanized her enough, and she&#39;s stuck 
true with us to the very end even when she didn&#39;t need to. You shouldn&#39;t 
still hold that grudge against her. It&#39;s petty.&quot;

Barret frowned at Tifa. &quot;What&#39;s gotten into you all of a sudden?&quot;

At this the woman sighed. &quot;Never mind...just think about what I said. 
And if you wanna know why Yuffie wanted to go on this trip, ask her 
yourself, because she hasn&#39;t told me yet.&quot;

&quot;Something with her dad again?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s all I know.&quot;

Barret frowned. &quot;You be careful, Tifa. Don&#39;t get caught in the middle of 
that feud.&quot;

Tifa turned to glare at him. &quot;I can handle myself, Barret.&quot;

Barret shrugged as he took another sip of his beer. &quot;I&#39;m jes&#39; sayin&#39;...I 
don&#39;t wanna see you get hurt.&quot;

Yuffie and Marlene came inside, sliding the glass door shut behind them. 
&quot;Okay, Marlene...I&#39;ve gotta go do something really quick. I&#39;ll be right 
back.&quot;

Tifa blinked at her. &quot;Do something? What&#39;re we gonna do?&quot;

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry.&quot; Yuffie waved her off as she went to the front door, 
&quot;You can stay here. I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;

&quot;But Yuffie, what&#39;re you going to-&quot;

&quot;See ya guys later!&quot; Yuffie left.

Tifa sighed in exasperation. &quot;What&#39;s she up to now?&quot;

Barret stood. &quot;You two gonna be stayin&#39; here or what?&quot;

The fighter rubbed her arm. &quot;If it&#39;s okay with you...we won&#39;t be here 
long, I don&#39;t think. Yuffie&#39;s eager to head off to Gold Saucer. She says 
they added some new things.&quot;

&quot;What the hell&#39;s she gonna do there besides gamble away her money? She 
gets motion sickness, she can&#39;t ride no roller coasters!&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s actually gotten better with her motion sickness, you know. I 
think it&#39;s because of that motorbike of hers.&quot;

&quot;I saw it. That&#39;s a nice ride.&quot;

Tifa grinned. &quot;Yeah, it is.&quot;

&quot;Well...any other time I&#39;d object to you guys high tailin&#39; it so soon, 
but since I&#39;ve got business to do tomorrow...I mean, I&#39;d cancel it if I 
could but...&quot;

&quot;Oh no!&quot; Tifa reached over and patted Barret&#39;s hand. &quot;Please! Don&#39;t back 
out on arrangements on our account! It&#39;s good enough to see you, even if 
it&#39;s for a short time!&quot;

Barret sighed. &quot;Thanks, Tifa...Maybe later, when you visit again,&quot; here 
he glared at her pointedly, &quot;I can show ya around the city. I know it&#39;s 
gotten a bit hectic, but there are some nice places to go.&quot;

Tifa smiled. &quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot;

----------

The invisible images seemed to be brought to life as if it had come to 
creation straight from her memory. The images were held in her slim, 
delicate hands, their glossy surfaces bringing a sly smile to her lips 
and inspiring haste in her feet.

The others had to see these.

Leaving the one-hour photo, Yuffie climbed onto her bike, quickly 
strapping on her helmet. About to start the bike up, the girl halted as 
a feeling crept up her back. Eyes widening some, she looked over her 
back, down the street. No one suspicious. Nothing to worry about.

It was all just in her head.

Shaking her fears from her mind, Yuffie started the bike and sped back 
to Barret&#39;s house.

There, she quickly parked at the curb, and bounding down the path, 
pounded on Barret&#39;s front door.

A split second later, Barret answered, looking annoyed. &quot;What the 
hell&#39;re you doin? Knocking like you were the police! Jes&#39; get inside ya 
dummy! Geez...&quot; The man stepped aside, and Yuffie, a little out of 
breath, grinned at Tifa, who was sitting on the couch in the living 
room.

Holding up the packet of developed pictures, the ninja grinned. &quot;I got 
the pictures developed.&quot;

Tifa looked up. &quot; Already?&quot;

&quot;Yep...I took a whole bunch before I visited you in Tiesmire. I&#39;ve got 
some here of Red XIII and of the new buildings over in Nibleheim.&quot;

Joining them on the couch, Yuffie took out the photos. &quot;Here&#39;s me and 
Red XIII at the top of Cosmo Canyon. He&#39;s gotten scruffier over the 
years, I think.&quot;

Tifa and Marlene scooted closer as they looked at the picture. Yuffie 
and Red XIII were shown, Yuffie kneeling with one arm thrown over the 
intelligent beast. The fighter laughed at the smile Red XIII gave the 
camera, his furry cheeks pushing up and his lips pulling back to reveal 
his sharp teeth.

Yuffie flipped through the other pictures. There were more photos of her 
and Red XIII, and even one photo of her in the Cave of the Gi. &quot;That 
place is mostly safe now. Nanaki cleared out a lot of the monsters in 
there. He said it was good exercise.&quot;

She flipped to the next picture, this one of Nibleheim&#39;s main square. 
Tifa&#39;s smile faltered some at the sight of it. &quot;It&#39;s completely 
different...&quot;

&quot;Told you.&quot; Yuffie said quietly, glancing at the woman. She flipped to 
the next picture. &quot;Here&#39;s the mansion. They didn&#39;t even touch this 
place. It&#39;s still as decrepit as ever.&quot;

She flipped through, showing all the other interesting buildings. It was 
when she reached the last pictures that Tifa turned ashen.

Smirking evilly, the ninja took out the first photo of this new set and 
held it up. &quot;Remember this?&quot;

&quot;Oh god no!&quot;

It was the photo of the chocobo biting Tifa&#39;s ear.

&quot;Lemme see that!&quot; Barret said, snatching the picture from Yuffie. 
Glancing at it, he burst into a harsh fit of laughter. Marlene jumped to 
her feet. &quot;I wanna see!&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Tifa pulled her back down as she stood up. &quot;Barret, give me that 
picture!&quot;

Yuffie snatched the picture from the man&#39;s hands. Barret himself was 
still laughing. &quot;You have to catch me if you want this!&quot; Yuffie 
exclaimed, darting up the stairs in front of the door to the second 
floor. Tifa charged after her. &quot;Yuffie, get back here!&quot;

Laughing, Yuffie ran into the room at the farthest end. It seemed to be 
the guest room. Moving to the side of the room where the window looked 
down at the backyard, Yuffie turned and laughed as she saw Tifa stumble 
into the room a second later. &quot;Give that here!&quot; Tifa cried breathlessly, 
her hand extended expectantly.

&quot;No way!&quot; Yuffie said, laughing as Tifa lunged at her, missing. The 
ninja rolled over the bed to the other side of the room. She began 
hurrying towards the door, hoping to escape, but Tifa stopped her, 
tackling her down onto the bed. Shrieking, Yuffie held the picture away 
from her. &quot;You aren&#39;t getting this, Rusty!&quot;

Tifa straddled the ninja with her legs. &quot;You sure about that?&quot; the woman 
said, and without warning, she began to tickle the girl beneath her.

Yuffie, surprised, started to squirm as laughter erupted from her mouth. 
&quot;No! No, stop, please! I-I can&#39;t breath!&quot;

&quot;Give me the picture!&quot;

&quot;N-no!&quot;

Tifa continued to tickle her. Marlene appeared at the door, her eyes 
wide at the sight she saw, but a large smile was on her face 
nonetheless. Yuffie, managing to see her from where she was being 
assaulted, cried, &quot;Marlene! Help me! Please!&quot;

Laughing, the young girl leapt onto the bed, tickling Tifa from behind. 
Tifa shouted out in surprise, rolling off of Yuffie as Marlene jumped on 
top of her. Taking a moment to catch her breath, Yuffie slid the picture 
into her back pocket before joining Marlene in her tickling attacks.

Barret, wiping tears from his eyes, appeared at the doorway, leaning on 
the frame. &quot;Hoo boy! That&#39;s hilarious stuff right there!&quot; he said with a 
chuckle.

----------

The house was quiet and still. Barret, Marlene, Tifa, and Yuffie had all 
gone to bed. Seeing as how there was only one guest room with one bed, 
the two travelers shared the room. Yuffie slept on the side nearest the 
window, and Tifa slept on the other side.

Looking at the clock, Tifa saw that it was now one in the morning. 
Sighing softly, the woman rolled onto her back. After days of staying up 
so late, it was hard for her body to get any rest. It was an 
inconvenience that the woman couldn&#39;t stand, for later on that day, 
Yuffie and her would be heading to Gold Saucer. They would leave 
Yuffie&#39;s motorbike in Barret&#39;s garage and take a taxi to the gondola 
station that would take them up to the amusement park.

Looking over to her companion, the woman could hear her breathing, slow, 
steady, and deep. It brought relief to Tifa, knowing that at least her 
friend was getting the rest she needed. The woman sat up some and looked 
down at Yuffie&#39;s face. There was her innocence again.

The woman smiled faintly.

Yuffie was a character of constant movement. Her passion had yet to find 
equal in this world, and sometimes, Tifa felt pale standing next to her. 
&quot;I&#39;m only twenty-three and I already feel so old.&quot; The woman thought, 
looking to the window.

But she stopped her thoughts there. She didn&#39;t feel like any late night 
musings.

Carefully slipping out of the bed, Tifa placed her feet on the floor. 
Moving to the window, the fighter glanced briefly down at her friend 
before looking down at the moon washed backyard.

It was when she saw the movement of a dark figure amid the bushes that 
the woman froze. One part of her dismissed the figure as simply the 
shadow of the leaves, moving about in the wind. Another part...saw a 
threat.

Deciding to listen to the latter, Tifa carefully crept out of the room, 
moving down the stairs with such stealth, it could have rivaled 
Yuffie&#39;s. Fists clenched at her sides, Tifa moved carefully to the 
sliding glass door. Looking around the backyard, she saw nothing.

Brow still creased with worry, the woman slowly went back to her room.

----------

Later that day, Tifa and Yuffie stood on the sidewalk, their backpack 
and duffel bag slung over their shoulders, the taxi waiting behind them. 
Barret and Marlene stood before them, smiles on their faces. &quot;You two 
have fun. Jes&#39; stay out of trouble, y&#39;hear?&quot; Barret looked at Yuffie 
especially. &quot;I want to see you both back here soon and in one 
piece...that bike ain&#39;t gonna stay in that garage forever!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll be careful. Thanks Barret.&quot; Tifa said, smiling.

Yuffie grinned at him. &quot;Yeah, thanks for letting me leave my bike here 
old man. You don&#39;t have to do this.&quot;

Barret waved her off. &quot;Pfft. It&#39;s fine!&quot;

Nodding, the ninja turned to look down at Marlene. Leaning forward, she 
said, &quot;I&#39;ll make sure to bring you back a BIG stuffed animal, okay 
Marlene?&quot;

Marlene grinned. &quot;Thanks, Yuffie!&quot;

Taking a moment to hug their friends, the two women waved their goodbye, 
and without another word, climbed into the taxi. Picking his daughter up 
into his arms, Barret and Marlene waved as the taxi drove away.
