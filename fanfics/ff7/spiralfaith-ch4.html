            __________________________________________________


            Tifa and Yuffie ended up wining the game.  Tomoyo got hurt 
by accident (Yuffie got a little rough), then Spin twisted her ankle 
(But kept playing).  Later that night She was babied (more than usual) 
by Amber due to her injury.

(Saturday, May 11) Amber and Spins house: Early in the morning:

            &#147;Oh, a little more, yeah, further, almost there&#148; Amber 
yells.  &#147;Okay, ahhh, done.&#148;  

            Spin had been trying to pop Amber&#146;s leg for a while, and 
was finally able to do it.  She wipes the sweat from her forehead, and 
falls backwards on the bed.  &#147;No more basket ball&#148; Spin sighs.  She 
lies there; on the edge of the bed for a few minutes then their 
doorbell rings causing her to remove herself from the bed.  

            She opens the door to find two men standing on the other 
side.  They are wearing black suits (Like the men in black) and are 
both white. One had short brown hair and the other had short black 
hair.  You couldn&#146;t see their eyes because there are hidden behind 
black sunglasses.

            &#147;Hello, is there a miss Spin here?&#148; asks the one with 
brown hair.

            &#147;Yeah, that is me.&#148;

            &#147;Hello, I am Ike,&#148; says the man with black hair.

            &#147;And I am Gary&#148; continues the man with brown hair.  
            
            &#147;Okay, what do you want,&#148; Spin asks, scratching her had 
with her right index finger.

            Ike and Gary look at each other then nod, and look back at 
her.  &#147; The goddess has heard of your&#146; task,&#148; Starts Gary.

            &#147;And she sent us down here to help you&#148; Ike continues.

            &#147;And we as her personal lackeys have obeyed.&#148;
            
            &#147;Okay,&#148; Spin was speechless (other than what she just 
said), &#147;well, let me talk to Tifa first then I&#146;ll tell you if we need 
your&#146; help.&#148;  

            &#145;Trust me we will&#148; says Tifa, as she appears from behind 
them.  &#147;I just got word from the boss that Kerek has joined a 
syndicate.&#148;  

            &#147;Ah what&#148; Spin asks.

            &#147;A mob&#148; Amber explains, grabbing Spin from behind.

            &#147;oh.&#148;

            &#147;Any way, if the Goddess sent them we&#146;ll probably need 
their help.&#148;  &#147;So, lets get going.&#148;

            &#147;Okay, lets go&#148; Spin exclaims.

            They start to leave then Tifa turns around and runs up to 
Amber.  &#147;Hey,&#148; she says in a whisper, &#147; can you watch Yuffie for me.&#146;  
&#147;It&#146;ll be kind of dangerous.&#148;

            &#147;Fine, under one condition, bring Spin back alive.&#148;

            &#147;Deal.&#148;

Car ride there: 

            &#147;So, does anyone know who the leader of this &#147;sin-di-cat&#148; 
is?&#148;  Spin asks from the back seat.

            &#147;First of all it is Syndicate,&#148; Correct Tifa, &#145;And second 
yes.&#148;  &#147;His name is Tidus, and he used to be in an Assassin Guild.&#148;

            &#147;Great.&#148;  &#147; Why did Kerek join them?&#148;

            &#147;Well, we&#146;ll just have to find that out.&#148; 

Syndicate:  

            &#147;Great how are we going to get in?&#148; sighs Tifa.

            &#147;I have an Idea,&#148; Announces Ike, who then looks a Gary and 
nods then gets up and walks towards the Syndicates Headquarters doors. 

            &#147;What is he doin?&#148; asks spin with a confused look on her 
face.

            &#147;Just watch&#146; says Gary.

            Ike gets to the door and rings the doorbell.  A large man 
and a big catlike human open the doors.  &#147;Did you two order a pizza?&#148; 
he asks (he is still wearing his suit).  They just stare at him for 
five minutes then pull him inside.

            &#147;Are you joking&#148; Spin stares in disbelief at what she just 
saw.

            &#147;Ike is slow,&#148; notes Gary. 

            Inside the building:

            The halls are filled with sounds, of people whining and 
grunting.  But one sound stands out.  The sound of Ike singing. He is 
singing the &#147;Gotta GO&#148; song fro the potty commercial (Which he sings 
every time when he has to go to the bath room.)

            &#147;Fine we&#146;ll let you go to the bathroom, jeez,&#148; one of his 
guards yells. He uncuffs Ike and leads him to the bathroom, then waits 
patiently outside while he goes.  

            Ike exits the bathroom, patting his stomach and saying 
&#147;And I don&#146;t Gotta Go right now.&#148;  The guards just sigh and lead him 
back.  Then they hand cuff him.

            The door at the far side of the room (Which Ike just 
notices) opens to reveal a visitor.  His neck length hair is shiny and 
silvery, while his eyes are a cold, chilling blue.

            No one in the syndicate really trusted him, except for 
Tidus their leader, who usually trusted no one.  &#147;Hello Ike&#148; he says 
in his usual scary voice, with a very uncommon smirk on his face, 
&#147;Your&#146; friends are coming for you.&#148;  With that said a monitor lowers 
form the ceiling with a picture of Gary Spin, and Tifa in a gunfight 
with some of the mobsters. &#147;But can they save you, or should the real 
question be, can they save us?&#148; 

            Just then the door flies open with Gary behind it, his 
arms raised and gun in hand (hands) pointed at Kerek.  Spin and Tifa 
charge in, with their guns out as well.

            &#147;Kerek, lets go, you&#146;re to good for this&#148; Spin yells, 
aiming her gun at one of the guards.  

            &#147;Whose Kerek, &#147; Kerek says, his voice sounding cheery. His 
eyes change as well; from being cold to warm and caring.

            &#147;What&#148; is the only word that can escape form both Tifa and 
Spin&#146;s mouth. 

Emotions-

The human race,

At one time flawless,

And perfect,

Now is a leaving example of what,

Not to be.

What is the cause?

Emotions them selves,

The key to our undoing.

Love,

Hate!,

Humor,

Sadness,

Pity.

They just hold us back,

From what we can be.

NO, what we should be.
