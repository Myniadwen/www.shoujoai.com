__________________________________________________________________

(May 13) Tifa and Yuffie&#146;s Apartment:  

     Tifa hugs a distraught Yuffie who is crying non-stop.  &#147;She did 
what?&#146;  Repeats Tifa a third time to the scared young woman.

     &#147;An Assassin Guilder came after me saying that you hurt their 
pride&#148; Yuffie finally answers, tears still flowing down her face.  

     &#147;This is my fault,&#148; sighs Tifa, hugging her lover tightly. 


Spin and Amber&#146;s Apartment:  

     The bedroom is filled giggles, sighs, and moans.  The sounds are 
accompanied by &#147;ohs&#148;, &#147;ews&#148;, and &#147;awes&#148;.  Spin laid back on her bed 
(resting her head) and sighs happily.  Amber wraps her hands and hugs 
her sweaty lover.  &#147;That was fun&#148; coos.

     Just as Spin is about to respond the phones rings.  Once, then 
twice, then a third time, finally Spin picks it up.  &#147;Hello, Spin 
here.&#146;

     &#147;Oh, hi Tifa.&#148;

     &#147;What!&#148;

     &#147;We&#146;re gonna have confront her, call her out.&#148;

     Spin hangs up the phone and rests her head.  &#147;What is going on my 
little girl,&#148; Amber asks softly.  

     &#147;An Assassin Guilder went after Yuffie today,&#148; Spin sighs, 
holding back tears.  &#147;Why, it is all my fault, because we went and 
fought the Syndicate, the boss is an ex-Assassin Guilder!&#148;   


(May 19)  On top of a building in downtown Tokyo: 

     Tifa and Spin had both got a letter from Kiah the day before.  It 
stated clearly to meet her on this roof at this time. There they are 
to do battle now.  Spin was thinking about the letter, and it is as if 
she was in a trance.  Yuffie and Amber came, and she was worried about 
their safety.  Suddenly a dark figure leaps over them (waking Spin up 
form her trance) and lands behind them.  Tifa turns to confront their 
new enemy.  &#147;If we&#146;re to fight then keep these two out of it.&#148;

     &#147;Don&#146;t worry, I am here for you two, not them&#148; Kiah yells. 

     &#147;Fine then, where are we going to fight&#148; Tifa asks.

     &#147;Wait do we have to fight&#148; Spin yells.

     &#147;Yes, now watch and see me use my magic,&#148; says Kiah as she 
reaches into her pocket and pulls out a purplish ball.  The ex- 
guilder throws the ball of the roof and it shines a bright yellow. As 
the flash fades two half circles appear floating in the sky.  &#147;Let us 
go.&#148;  With that she pulls out three more ball (gray) and throw two of 
them at Tifa and Spin, leaving the last for herself.  A dark gray mist 
covers all three of them.  As the smoke clears they are gone and move 
to the top semi-circle.  

     The inside is dark and purple (with black strips moving threw 
it).  Tifa and Spin look around with their mouths agape. &#147;Where are 
we&#148; Tifa enquires.

     &#147;Don&#146;t Know.&#148;

     &#147;It is one of the circles in the sky,&#148; Kiah starts, &#147;They are 
parts of another dimension ripped apart from the whole and put here.&#148;

     Tifa turns to face a black cloak with a blade (the one from 
before).  She draws her gun from the holster on her right arm, &#147;lets 
do this.&#148;   Kiah hold her blade up and points it at Tifa.  She begins 
to scream and charges them with her waist bent lowering her to the 
ground (but she keeps her blade pointed at Tifa).  Tifa fires three 
bullets but the Guilder blocks them with the sword on her right arm.  
When she reaches Tifa she raises back in the air and stabs at her.  
Quickly without thinking Spin leaps in the way and the blade goes into 
her stomach.  

     &#147;Ahh, oohh,&#148; Spin sighs, trying to form words, but nothing came 
to her.  The pain was the only thing she could feel, and the blood 
running down her stomach.  Tifa appears form behind Spin and fires a 
bullet at the Guilder, but she swiftly moves to the left (pulling the 
blade with her).  The red head detective screams in pain then falls to 
her knees and finally to her hands.  At the end she was on her face.  

     &#147;Spin&#148; Tifa screams running to her best friend.  She shakes her 
and says her name, but its no use, Spin hears and sees nothing.  Tifa 
is about to say Spins name again but is interrupted by the sound of a 
gun being loaded.  She turns to be staring down a barrel (and the edge 
of a sword).  Suddenly the dimension rip begins to shake (throwing her 
off balance) as Kiah pulls the trigger.  The bullet flies past Tifa&#146;s 
head and flies into Spins chest (her left breast to be exact). Tifa 
grabs Spin (who is covered in blood and stands.  &#147;Hey, Guilder whats 
going on?&#148;  

     Kiah looks back from where she is (right infront of a hole in the 
floor).  &#147;This part of the dimension rips is falling apart due to us 
being here.&#148;  After explaining she leaps threw the hole and goes out 
of sight.  Tifa (dragging Spin with her runs over to it, but the dome 
falls apart.  The bottom starts to flip and Tifa holds on. When it 
hits the ground (or right before) she leaps threw the middle and makes 
it in the bottom dome.  

     It looks just like the other (only up side down) and the floor 
molds momentarily to your&#146; body.  Tifa hits the sidewall and slide to 
the middle (leaving a mold of her butt that slides down with her).  
Kiah was nowhere to be found.  It was quite, which has become unusual 
to them.  Suddenly the tranquility was chattered as a scream filled 
the air.  Tifa looks up to find Kiah falling from the top, her body 
glowing a light blue.  As she hits the sidewall (where Tifa had just 
leapt from, leaving Spin by accident) her body explodes, taking the 
wall with her. 

     &#147;Spin&#148; Amber yells from outside, looking at a cloud of smoke 
where the bottom half of the semi circle used to rest. 


Logic-

Logic is something the waking world (our world) created. 

We created it to make our lives sensible to us.

Though truly it only brings more questions.  

No matter how many times you try to explain what&#146;s going on,

It all leads back to one question.

Why?
