Misa turned around to see a swarm of creatures tailing them.  The 
swarm surrounded them, but the creatures maintained a distance of 
about ten feet.  They flew further from the mothership, with the swarm 
serving as an unlikely escort.  Meanwhile, more explosions could be 
heard behind them.  Sammy looked back and saw that part of the swarm 
behind them seemed frozen in place.  Some of them exploded into 
pieces.  When the debris of the explosions cleared, Sammy saw what was 
truly behind them.

&quot;Ro-Romio!&quot;  Her heart beat wildly with fear as Romio floated in a 
bubble near the rear of the swarm.  Her left hand sparked magic while 
her right shoulder supported a bazooka like device.  Her head turned 
toward Sammy and her eyes glowed red with malice.

&quot;Misa!  She can see us!&quot;

&quot;Hold on!&quot;  Misa guided Tetsuo forward and to the left, hoping to hide 
behind the swarm.  More explosions erupted behind them.

&quot;She&#39;s gaining on us!&quot;

&quot;Faster, you damn bird, or I&#39;ll have you for dinner!&quot;

A creature exploded to their immediate right.  Suddenly, they froze.  
Misa and Sammy&#39;s hair stood on end as they waited for the impact.  
They heard the sound of a large explosion, but felt no impact.  
Suddenly, they couldn&#39;t see anything and felt themselves tumbling 
through space and into... Ryo-Ohki&#39;s ship?

&quot;Hey!  Are you both ok?&quot;  Ryo-Ohki called out.

They lay still on the floor, and then started laughing.   Ryo-Ohki 
sweatdropped.

&quot;I thought we were goners!&quot;  Misa sat up and rubbed her behind.

&quot;I was so scared!  Thanks, Ryo-Ohki!&quot;  Sammy cradled the creature 
slowly.  It screeched faintly.

&quot;Don&#39;t thank me yet.  She&#39;s got us.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I can barely move the ship.&quot;  The ship vibrated with an explosion.  

&quot;My shields are barely holding.&quot;

&quot;So what do we do now?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try to hold as long as I can.  The fleet is coming over, since 
most of the creatures seemed to have gathered here.&quot;

Misa looked at Sammy.  &quot;Do you suppose they&#39;re following their queen?&quot;
Sammy glanced at the creature.  &quot;Well, if this is their queen, do they 
want it back?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s see, if I had a queen, and someone took it from me, I would do 
what I can to get her back.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I understand what you mean.&quot;  Sammy smiled knowingly.
Misa gave her a blank stare and then blushed.  &quot;Ahem.  If we give it 
back, who do we give it to?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.  Trial and error?&quot;

&quot;~Okay!~  Let&#39;s go!&quot;  Misa helped Sammy on to Tetsuo, and then climbed 
out.  Then they began to phase out the portal.

&quot;Hey!  Where are you...&quot;  Ryo-Ohki&#39;s voice faded as they flew out and 
headed for the largest group of creatures.  They hovered here and 
there, but the creatures seemed to keep their distance.  Finally, a 
creature with brighter colors than the others hovered in place even as 
they approached it.  Misa guided Tetsuo close and Sammy kicked off 
toward the creature.  She came close to the creature enough to touch 
the &#39;queen&#39; to the creature&#39;s breastplate.  She let go and the queen 
hovered in place.  The creature gathered its limbs around the queen 
and flew away.  The swarm around them followed the queen.

&quot;I guess that&#39;s that.&quot;

&quot;Seems kinda anti-climatic.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.  Let&#39;s go back to Ryo-Ohki.&quot;

They flew back and saw no sign of Ryo-Ohki&#39;s ship.  The space littered 
with debris.  Sammy feared the worst.

&quot;You don&#39;t suppose he...&quot;

&quot;No... he&#39;s pretty tough, right?&quot;

Just then a cruiser pulled alongside them and opened a side portal.  
An armored soldier beckoned them.  Misa guided Tetsuo in.  

&quot;Are you both alright?&quot;  the guard asked as they landed.

&quot;Yes!  But Ryo-Ohki...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but his ship was destroyed.  However, Romio&#39;s been 
captured!  The war is over!&quot;

Misa and Sammy&#39;s faces wore shock.  &quot;Ryo-Ohki!  I&#39;m so sorry we 
couldn&#39;t help you!&quot;  Sammy buried her face in her hands.  &quot;Just when 
we meet again, I&#39;ve lost you!  Ryo-Ohki!  It&#39;s not fair!&quot;

&quot;Romio never fights fair.&quot;  

Sammy looked up and saw Ryo-Ohki walking up to them.  &quot;Ryo-Ohki!&quot;  She 
ran and hugged Ryo-Ohki.

Ryo-Ohki blushed.  &quot;I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re alright, Pretty Sammy.&quot;  He 
gently pulled away.

&quot;So you escaped!  I&#39;m so glad.&quot;

&quot;Romio was strong.  All I could do was delay her.  So when I escaped, 
I exploded all my smokebombs.&quot;  He smiled.  &quot;By the time it cleared, 
the fleet arrived and captured her.&quot;

He turned to both of them.  &quot;If it&#39;s not too much to ask, Her Majesty 
would like to invite you to celebrate our victory.&quot;

&quot;Of course!  I promised that I&#39;ll be back for tea.&quot;  Sammy turned to 
Misa.  &quot;You&#39;re coming too, right, Misa.&quot;

&quot;Ano, yes, I will.&quot;

&quot;Okay, let&#39;s go!&quot; 

The celebration lasted for most of the night.  The celebrants toasted 
to the restoration of the Balance of Gemini.   Everyone was in high 
spirits.  Sammy wanted to stay, but she knew her parents might be 
worried for her.  Tsunami opened the portal to Earth and Misao and 
Sasami emerged in Misao&#39;s room.  Sasami quickly called her parents who 
were surprised to hear from her.  

&quot;My Dad&#39;s picking me up!&quot;  Sasami exclaimed as she sat down next to 
Misao on her bed.

&quot;That&#39;s great!&quot;  Misao smiled, but there seemed to be a hint of 
sadness in her voice.

&quot;Misao, you sound... different.  Were you hurt?&quot;

&quot;No... maybe I&#39;m just tired.&quot;

Sasami clasped her hand over Misao&#39;s.  &quot;Misao, thank you.&quot;

&quot;What for?&quot;

&quot;For everything.&quot;  Sasami looked earnestly into Misao&#39;s eyes.  Misao 
smiled.  (I remember... that smile.  How I&#39;ve missed it.)

&quot;You&#39;re welcome, Sasami-chan.&quot;

They chatted a little bit about the celebration until Sasami heard the 
roar of a motorcycle outside.  &quot;Dad&#39;s here.  I have to go.&quot;

&quot;Can I... can I visit you sometime?&quot;

&quot;Of course.  I&#39;ll give you a call.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot;  Misao escorted Sasami to the door where she was swept off her 
feet by her father.  They said their goodbyes and Misao watched them 
go.  She closed the door, and began to walk to her bedroom, but the 
tears wouldn&#39;t stop.  Her heart ached.  (Sasami...)  She cried herself 
to sleep.
