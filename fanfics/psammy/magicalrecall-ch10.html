Misao served Rumiya tea and snacks while Ramia slept in her bedroom.  
She watched Rumiya as he gobbled down some crackers.

&quot;So this is your human form?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;  *crunch*  &quot;I usually stay as a bird, since it&#39;s easier to 
travel.&quot;  *munch*  &quot;And I don&#39;t expend as much energy.&quot;  *crunch*

&quot;You don&#39;t look like a girl at all.&quot;

&quot;Umphf!  Achem!&quot;  Rumiya just managed to prevent himself from choking.  

&quot;I hope not.  I&#39;m a boy after all.&quot;

&quot;Do people in Juraihelm dye their hair?&quot;

&quot;Err, no not really.  Some people make it more full and silkier.  
Why do you ask?&quot;

&quot;Well, yours seems to be in different shades.&quot;
Rumiya rubbed his head in embarrassment.  &quot;Oh that!  I fell into a 
trap, and Sis pulled me out.  I think the energy from the trap made my 
hair fry.&quot;

&quot;It surprised me, that Ramia is your sister.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, she is.  She looks scary and violent, but she can be nice 
sometimes.  She took care of me when I was younger, and taught me most 
of my magic.&quot;

&quot;She knows a lot of magic?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, in fact, she was candidate for Queen.  Then she became Chief 
Magistrate.  And she was chosen to fetch the Scroll from Misty 
Mountain.  When we went there, she and I broke through countless 
barriers.  Then she saved me from a trap.  Finally, she solved the 
riddle of the Hall of Lights and brought us here.  She&#39;s really 
tough.&quot;  

Misao listened to Rumiya and realized how much he admired his sister.  
She smiled at the thought.  (I guess she&#39;s a good person after all.)

&quot;Don&#39;t be scared of her, Misao.  She&#39;s really not that bad.&quot;
Misao nodded.  &quot;Mm.  I understand her better now.&quot;  Misao sipped her 
tea.  &quot;I wonder when she&#39;ll wake up.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.  She might sleep all day.  She used up a lot of magic 
getting the Scroll.  And that Soul Gaze really used up a lot.&quot;
&quot;Why does she want the Scroll?&quot;

&quot;The High Priest said that it may have a spell that can free Sammy 
from the binding magic.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I see.&quot;  Misao started to see Ramia in a different light.  (She&#39;s 
trying to help Sasami.)  &quot;I guess I should thank her when she wakes 
up.&quot;  Then she noticed that the snacks were gone.  &quot;Oh, let me get 
some more snacks.&quot;  Misao stood up.

&quot;That&#39;s alright, Misao.&quot;  Rumiya cupped his hand over a yawn.  &quot;I 
think I should get some sleep too.&quot;  Rumiya walked to the couch.  &quot;Is 
it ok if I sleep here?&quot;

&quot;Mm.  Let me get you some blankets.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

Misao handed Rumiya some blankets and then went to her bedroom.  Ramia 
lay sprawled on the bed.  Misao took out the guest bedding and slept 
on it.   

Misao awoke to violent shaking.  &quot;Finally!  Get up!  We&#39;re running out 
of time!&quot;  Ramia spoke harshly, and her hand pulled Misao&#39;s arm up.  
Misao sat up quickly and Ramia let go and walked out of the bedroom.  

&quot;Rumiya!  Get up!&quot;

* slap! slap! slap! *

&quot;Si-sis!  You&#39;re awake!&quot;

&quot;Idiot!  Why did you let me sleep!  We&#39;re running out of time!&quot;

&quot;Wha?  How?&quot;

&quot;No time to explain.  Fly us to Sammy.&quot;

They arrived in Sammy&#39;s room.  Ramia led Misao to Sasami&#39;s side.  &quot;Put 
one hand on her head and another over her heart.&quot;  Misao did as she 
was told.  &quot;Good.&quot;  Ramia stood behind her and took out the Scroll.  
She opened it and let it float beside Misao.  She put her hands on 
Misao&#39;s head.  &quot;I will be your spiritual and physical anchor.  Resist 
me and you risk severing our link.&quot;  She made her voice more 
threatening.  &quot;And remember, stay out of my mind.&quot;

Misao swallowed and nodded.

&quot;Good.  I will be seeing through you.  If you sense resistance, tell 
me and I will break it.  Defend yourself only when you have to.  You 
have to save your energy to find Sammy and get her out.&quot;  Her finger 
tips pressed firmly on to Misao&#39;s temple.  &quot;Get ready.&quot;

&quot;Ramia-san?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;... Thank me later after you get Sammy.&quot;

&quot;Of course!&quot;  

Ramia began chanting in Juraian.  Misao felt her energies wrap around 
her.  She closed her eyes and braced herself.  Her inner vision 
blurred with a murky grey which slowly shifted into a motley of 
colors.  She felt like she was flying in this space.  She felt a 
presence to her left, and gasped to see a ghostly form holding her 
shoulder.  But when she looked closer, the form outlined Ramia&#39;s 
features and the silhouette of her body.  Ramia turned to her and 
pointed to a mass of white and pink mist.  Misao nodded and dove in.

The mist parted before them and they reached a space of pure pink.  
Within it, a structure shaped like a gigantic heart floated.  They 
stopped at a what seemed to be a doorway in the shape of a key hole.  
Ramia&#39;s fist sparked with energy and hit the door.  Pink energy flew 
out, and Misao cringed for the impact which didn&#39;t come.  Ramia&#39;s 
other hand formed a void which was sucking the energy.  The door 
collapsed, and they went in.

Before them stood a wall.  There were passages leading left and right, 
up and down.  The wall itself seems to shift in and out of focus.  
Ramia turned to Misao.  &quot;Your turn.&quot;  
Misao nodded.  Her time had come to find Sasami.  She floated up.  
&quot;Wait for me, Sasami.  I&#39;m coming!&quot;
