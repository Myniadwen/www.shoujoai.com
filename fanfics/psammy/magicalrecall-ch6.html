Queen Tsunami flopped down in exhaustion on her feather filled bed.  
Her day felt long and hectic as the Magistrates of Magic had rallied 
for her favor and counsel over political positions and obscure laws.  
She was about to doze off into slumber land when she heard a 
resounding click that reverberated throughout the castle.  In her 
dazed state, she mulled over its cause.  Then realization hit her 
heart like a thunderbolt, and she jumped to her feet as her heart 
palpitated with shock.  &quot;It can&#39;t be... &quot;  she whispered.  She 
gathered her wits and ran to the Great Hall.  When she entered the 
Hall, she was surprised to see other people there as well.  Their 
anxious eyes were glued to the large sculpture in the middle of the 
Hall.  Queen Tsunami swallowed hard at the sight of the large 
sculpture.  The Balance of Gemini was no longer balanced.

Somehow, her mere presence caused everyone in the Hall to turn and 
look at her.  A nearby guard undid his cloak and draped it over her 
shoulders while he averted his eyes.  The High Priest walked up to 
her, with his hand over his nose.  &quot;My Queen, please remember to be 
appear more modest next time.&quot;  He stood before her, as if shielding 
her from everyone&#39;s eyes.  &quot;My Queen&quot; he said softly.  &quot;Do you know 
why?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;  Tsunami answered.  

&quot;Already, I sense the link to Earth is weakening.  We must determine 
the cause.&quot;  His brows furrowed with concern.

&quot;Then summon the magistrates for an emergency council.&quot;

&quot;As you wish.  Also, may I suggest that we double the border patrols.  
If She-who-will-not-be-named finds out, Juraihelm may be in peril.&quot;

&quot;Please do.&quot;

&quot;By your command, I take my leave.&quot;  The High Priest inclined his head 
slightly and withdrew.  The Royal guard stood in his place.  As Queen 
Tsunami was escorted to her room, she wondered.  (Why did this 
happen?)

The assembly hall began to fill with confused and agitated magistrates.
Chief Magistrate Ramia twiddled her thumbs under the table as she
waited for the arrival of the rest of the magistrates.  Her efforts
were wasted as she lost the rhythm which should have calmed her mind.
She was irritated from being interrupted during her midnight
diversions, but duty comes first.   Being Chief Magistrate had brought
her countless trouble since it was her duty to protect Tsunami from
political crises, some of which were precipitated by Tsunami herself.
However, she luxuriated in the power that allowed her to influence
Juraian politics and law.

(Even though you&#39;re Queen, Tsunami, I still pull the strings.)  She 
took enormous satisfaction at that thought. 
 
After she had teleported into the assembly hall, one of the senior 
magistrates informed her of the situation. Through a veneer of 
calmness, she merely replied, &quot;Is that so?&quot;, but her mind was at work 
at the probable cause, or possibly, causes given the last set of 
instigated events in the past 2 months.  Juraian focusing techniques 
should have reduced the panic she felt, but her thumbs flicked 
randomly, and her thoughts couldn&#39;t stay focused.  Finally, the last 
magistrate took his seat.  The balcony above the hall shimmered.  
Ramia stood up to begin the ritual invocation.

&quot;All hail, her Majesty, Queen Tsunami of Juraihelm!&quot;

Ramia watched as Tsunami waved from the dais on the balcony, and the 
magistrates bowed and saluted her.  Tsunami looked radiant and 
imperial, but Ramia sensed that this was merely a side effect of a 
glamour spell which Tsunami frequently used.  (She was always such an 
airhead.)   Nevermind the fact that this same airhead offered her the 
Chief Magistrate position on a whim.  Despite her whimsical nature, 
Ramia was grudgingly grateful that Tsunami did not pause to think that 
she was giving such an important position to her rival. 

But Tsunami was Queen now, and with a voice laced with gravity, she 
began the council.  &quot;We are gathered here to determine the 
implications of the Imbalance of Gemini.&quot;  (This is going to be a long 
night.), Ramia thought as she scanned the magistrates&#39; faces and 
resigned herself to listen to the first speaker.  

The magistrates deliberated for about 4 hours.  Ramia sighed deeply.  
By some obscure law, the magistrates could have voted Tsunami to 
relinquish the throne on the grounds that her rule disrupted the 
Balance of Gemini, and is therefore, unfit to be Queen.  Given the 
current political situation, they might have instituted the vote to 
dethrone her and start the selection of a new Queen.  However the mood 
of the magistrates changed when the High Priest presented her nosy 
brother, Rumiya who should have been stationed at a border outpost.   
Rumiya reported increased activity in the region of space where 
She-who-must-not-be-named was last seen.  With the security of 
Juraihelm uncertain, the council voted to take measures to right the 
Balance.  Since the Balance might have reacted to events on Earth,
someone must go to Earth and find those who might be able to wield 
magic and to ask them for assistance.  Rumiya volunteered for the 
task, citing a few &#39;scouting&#39; missions on Earth.  Before anyone could 
ask Rumiya to elaborate about these missions, Ramia pushed for his 
appointment, and thus the task had fallen to Rumiya who solemnly 
accepted.  But Ramia could see his concealed joy.  

(You almost opened a can of pixie poop, Rumiya.  I&#39;ll have to teach 
you a lesson later.)  

For herself, there was much to do.  The magistrates must be instructed 
to organize their local forces within their districts and to assemble 
these forces quickly, if needed.  Then she would have to meet with the 
Warmaster to make sure that the garrisons were manned and stocked, and 
the to discuss improvements in Juraihelm&#39;s defenses.  She was not 
looking forward to meeting the leering, lecher of a War Master.  And 
as rare as it happened, she envied Rumiya for enjoying his current 
task too much.
