The walls grated and cracked as Ramia&#39;s spell and Misao&#39;s interfering 
magic disrupted the power flow of the binding magic.

&quot;Keep it up Misao!&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot;

Sasami looked at Misao in awe.  Her face knotted with concentration.  
Her form seemed to dim at times.  The armor vibrated loudly as pieces 
of wall struck it.  Then, a crack opened near Misao&#39;s left shoulder.  

&quot;Aaah!&quot;  screamed Misao.

&quot;Concentrate!&quot;  yelled the woman&#39;s voice.

&quot;Yes... let it flow... then mold it... and release!&quot;  Misao&#39;s form 
shimmered and dimmed as sparks flowed through the armor.  Sasami heard 
a terrible crack from outside the armor.

(I want to help too.  If I have magic, I should be able to use it.)  
Sasami touched the armor and tried to imitate Misao.

(Let it flow...)  She felt a warm energy coursing through the armor.  

(Misao, please accept my magic.)  Sasami imagined gathering up her 
magic, and sent it through her hands.  (And release!)

Misao concentrated on changing the binding magic into an opposing 
energy to  would cancel out the strength of the binding.  All of the 
sudden, she felt a  strong surge of energy build up in her armor.  She 
reflexively shifted the energy into the wall.  

The wall disintegrated and the next wall near it began to do the same.  
&quot;Almost done!&quot;  cried Ramia.  She felt Ramia lower her defensive 
magic.  (She&#39;s going to end it!  And so will I!)  Misao gathered the 
magic witihin her armor and in unison with Ramia, delivered it with a 
war cry.  &quot;Sexyyy... Mysticaal... Disruptor!&quot;

There was a blinding light as the remaining walls disintegrated.  
Misao felt the armor fade away as she floated limply in space... a 
pink space.  She stared at it for a few moments.  Then warm arms held 
her up.  A pair of pink eyes stared into hers.  &quot;Misao?&quot;

&quot;Sasami?&quot;

&quot;Are you alright?&quot;

&quot;Mm.&quot;  Misao nodded.  She felt very tired.

&quot;Thank goodness.&quot;  Sasami hugged her close.

Ramia floated nearby.  Her face knotted in concentration as she sensed 
the residue of the binding magic.  Her eyes narrowed as a memory 
surfaced from its hiding place.  (Now, I remember.)  She looked at her 
fading hand.  (We better get out of here.)

&quot;Time&#39;s up.&quot;  said Ramia while tugging at Misao&#39;s shoulder.

The pink space blurred to a murky gray and then into darkness.  Misao 
panicked.  (Did we fail?)

&quot;Idiot.  Open your eyes.&quot;  said Ramia.

Misao did and found herself hugging Sasami on her hospital bed.  She 
drew back to look at Sasami&#39;s face.

&quot;Sasami.&quot;

&quot;Misao.&quot;  Misao stared into Sasami&#39;s eyes.  &quot;I&#39;m free.&quot;

&quot;Thank goodness!&quot;  Misao hugged her fiercely.
