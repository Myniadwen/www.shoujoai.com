They passed many turns and barriers.  Misao was begining to be 
frustrated.  Her hair ruffled from a breeze she didn&#39;t feel.  She made 
several more turns when Ramia tugged at her shoulder.  

&quot;We&#39;ve been here before.&quot;  Ramia pointed at a feather shaped sigil 
floating in the air.  &quot;And, there was a wall there.&quot;

Misao exploded with anger.  &quot;That&#39;s not fair!&quot;

Ramia quickly encircled her arms around Misao and drew her close.  The 
passage way constricted around them and formed sharp points which 
broke as they crashed against Ramia&#39;s forcefield.

&quot;Move!&quot;  shouted Ramia.

Misao flew past the constricting passage, and turned recklessly into 
several.  &quot;Too fast!  Look care...&quot;

Misao felt an invisible force wrapping around her.  She felt Ramia 
scream in defiance.  The force constricted and she resisted.

&quot;No!&quot;

The force slackened and Ramia quickly chanted in Juraian.  The force 
faded.  Misao quickly looked about her, and then at Ramia.  She gasped 
when she saw Ramia&#39;s form fading in and out.

&quot;Idiot.&quot;  whispered Ramia.  &quot;Defense is my job.  Save your magic to 
find Sammy.  By the way, when are you going to do that?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m trying!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re using your eyes.  Use your magic.&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;m not Pixy Misa.&quot;

&quot;... You are Misa.  Like it or not.&quot;

&quot;No!&quot;

&quot;Just do it!&quot;

Misao panicked.  Ramia&#39;s form faced her with sightless eyes, but it 
felt like she was being watched by a hawk.  She gulped and closed her 
eyes.

(Misa, please, help me.)

(It&#39;s about time you called.)  answered Misa.

(Please, use your magic to save Sasami!)

(~Go right ahead.~)

(What?)

(I am you and you are me.  ~Sorry babe~, I&#39;m a part of you.  So accept 
me for who you are.)

(But... )  Misao remembered the newspaper clippings in her scrapbook.

(Forget that, and remember, even Sasami said that she would love you 
even if you stayed as Pixy Misa.)

(She did?)

(Why am I the only one that remembers?  Sheesh!  So do you want me or 
not?)

(Yes.)  Misao&#39;s inner self held out her hand to Pixy Misa who took it 
and drew her close.  

(I&#39;ve been waiting for this.)  Then Pixy Misa kissed her.


When Misao opened her eyes, she felt energized, and her senses tingled 
with sudden clarity.  Her eyes noted the shifting pattern of the 
walls.  Her skin felt the rustling of a wind that did not blow.  She 
let it all come to her and let her own energies ride its flow.  Then 
she gathered her energies around her.

Ramia watched with impatience as Misao&#39;s energies leaked around her.  
Eventually, the energies began to coalesce and started to form armor 
around Misao.  Then she was pulled into the energy which swirled 
around her.  She reflexively tried to resist, but quickly realized 
that she wasn&#39;t being attacked.  A gem like enclosure surrounded her 
and she felt more attuned to Misao&#39;s spirit.  Finally, the energy 
formations subsided and she looked around.

&quot;What&#39;s with this armor?!&quot;

&quot;Better defenses for me and you.&quot;

&quot;As long as you look ahead, I can defend for you.&quot;

&quot;You can do that yourself, that&#39;s why you&#39;re up there.&quot;

&quot;Ah!&quot;  (She&#39;s right, this enclosure amplifies my senses and brings me 
closer to her senses.  Bah!  But I look silly sticking out of her 
helmet.)

&quot;I&#39;m going in!  Forming Mystics!&quot;

Misao&#39;s gloved hands merged into the wall.  Ramia spoke a counter 
spell as the wall resisted.  Misao&#39;s thoughts echoed in her mind.  It 
was like hearing Misao&#39;s and Misa&#39;s voice blending together.
Shift... Flow... then mold it to my will.)

Ramia realized that Misao was reforming the binding magic, so she 
lowered the force of her counter spell to allow Misao to gather more 
energy.

(If I can&#39;t find a way to you, then I will guide you to me.)  The 
walls began to vibrate.  (Sasami, please hear me!)

Misao began to sing.  The walls resonated with Misao&#39;s voice and a 
sound of an invisible piano. 

A new dimension of love
A bold adventure waiting for you
The true dimension of love 
A soaring flight, a dazzling view
 
The melody flowed with the binding energy.  Ramia was impressed.  
(Using the walls&#39; energies to carry her voice!  Brilliant!  She truly 
is my kindred spirit.)  Ramia sensed the binding magic in the wall.  

(What a minute, this flow feels familiar.  Where have I sensed it 
before?)


Sasami lay curled on the ground.  She was tired and scared.  She had 
lost track of how long she had been running through this labyrinth.  
She wept bitterly with frustration.  

&quot;Someone help me, please!&quot;  she whimpered.  She lay quietly, tasting 
her tears.

The ground seemed to shake.  The labyrinth was probably changing 
again.  All her markers would be lost.  The ground grated with a sound 
of... a piano?  Sasami listened again.  The ground shook and she 
definitely could hear the faint sounds of a piano, and ... a voice.  A 
girl&#39;s voice.

Soon, in the April breeze
We will bring alive the memories

&quot;Misao!&quot;  Sasami stood up and listened.  When she couldn&#39;t hear, she 
cupped her ear to the ground.  &quot;Where are you, Misao?&quot;

The voice seemed to be coming to her right so she took several 
passages to her right.  The floor ended with a passageway down.  She 
pressed her ear to the wall.

The voice was little louder now, but coming from below.  Sasami 
swallowed hard as she looked down at the passage.  Carefully, she 
tried to climb down and screamed as she lost her hold.  She was 
surprised to find that she defied gravity by floating down to the 
level below.  Relieved, she listened again.

Enough of wandering far and wide
I just can&#39;t forget you though I&#39;ve tried

&quot;I&#39;m coming, Misao!  I will see your smiling face again!  Wait for 
me!&quot;

Sasami followed Misao&#39;s voice as it carried through the walls.  The 
walls resonated with Misao&#39;s voice and Sasami didn&#39;t need to press her 
ear to the wall.  She ran as fast as she could follow her voice.

This is destiny so why pretend
Close your eyes, hold me once again

When she turned left, an armored form with wings was leaning into the 
wall about a 100 yards away. Sasami knew her search was over.  She ran 
forward.

I&#39;ll always be the only one you need
So go where your deepest longing leads

&quot;Misao!&quot;  Sasami called as she leaped towards the armored form.  The 
armor turned towards her.  Its chest opened a cavity and Misao shone 
forth, enveloped in bright, yellow swirling lights.  

&quot;Sasami!&quot;  Glowing arms reached out and took her into the armor.  The 
armor sealed the opening behind her.  Sasami hugged Misao fiercely.  

&quot;I was so scared!&quot;  Tears of joy and relief trickled down her cheeks.  

&quot;I&#39;m so glad to find you, Misao!&quot;  

&quot;Me too, Sasami.&quot;  Then Misao paused.  Sasami felt the armor 
constrict.  A woman&#39;s voice echoed in the armor.  &quot;We have to get out 
of here.&quot;

Misao nodded.  &quot;I&#39;m ready.&quot;

The woman chanted in a strange language and Sasami felt the armor 
tingling.  &quot;What&#39;s going on, Misao?&quot;

&quot;Ramia and I will break the binding magic that kept you here.&quot;

&quot;You know magic?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;  Misao smiled.  &quot;In fact, so do you, Pretty Sammy.&quot;

&quot;Pretty Sammy?&quot;

&quot;Misao!&quot;  cried the woman.

&quot;You are the magical girl, Pretty Sammy, and I am the loveliest, 
formerly baddest, magical girl, Pixy Misaaa!&quot;  Sasami felt something 
like electricity flow through Misao.  &quot;I will never lose you again, 
Sasami!  I will break the bonds that trap you here.&quot;  Misao&#39;s eyes 
glowed with her inner strength.
