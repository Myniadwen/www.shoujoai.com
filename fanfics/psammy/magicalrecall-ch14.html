Ryo-Ohki&#39;s flying was indescribable.  Misao and Sasami lost count of 
how many creatures were shot down.  Eventually, Ryo-Ohki stopped long 
enough to shrink them and released them on the cover of a smokescreen.  
Tetsuo&#39;s flying was like a roller coaster, but they somehow managed to 
guide him into an open crevice on the mothership.  

The walls partitioned out in a honeycomb like structure.  

&quot;This reminds me of a bee hive.&quot;  commented Sasami.

&quot;Even so, where do we start looking?&quot;

&quot;Well, if it&#39;s like a hive, then it must have a queen.&quot;

&quot;Right, does the queen control the hive?&quot;

&quot;I think so, because she&#39;s the one that makes baby bees.&quot;  

Misao giggled, and Sasami gave her a bewildered look.  &quot;Sorry, you 
phrased it so cutely.  Baby bees.&quot;  

Sasami smiled back.  &quot;Alright, larvae then.  Ready?&quot;  Sasami squeezed 
Misao&#39;s hand.

Misao gripped Tetsuo&#39;s feathers.  &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;

They navigated carefully to avoid any creatures and searched for the 
center of the ship.  They stopped near the threshold of a large 
cavern.  In the center of the cavern is a smaller version of a 
creature with fairy like wings.  A pulsating forcefield surrounded it.  
A woman in dark robes stood nearby.  She watched a large viewscroll 
and would occasionally say something in a language they couldn&#39;t 
understand.

&quot;Looks like Romio.&quot;  whispered Sasami.

&quot;Yes.  Do you understand her?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Me neither.&quot;

They watched Romio for a while.  The viewscroll showed the battle in 
Juraihelm.  In one area, a group of Juraihelm ships decimated a swarm 
of creatures.  Romio pointed toward the area and spoke.  The winged 
figure seemed to bow slightly and its antennae would flash.  A few 
moments later, a larger swarm of creatures surrounded the ships and 
attacked them.  They watched a bit longer, and saw her do something 
similar with another set of ships.  

&quot;Sasami, I think she&#39;s controlling that creature or she&#39;s telling it 
what to do.&quot;

&quot;Maybe she&#39;s forcing it to do what she wants.  Remember, the Warmaster 
said that the creatures seemed magic resistant.  She may not be strong 
enough to control it, but she may have found a way to trap it.&quot;

&quot;The forcefield seems to be coming from there.&quot;  Misao&#39;s eyes scanned 
the base where the forcefield flowed from.  &quot;Kagato Industries!&quot;  She 
spat out the name in revulsion.  &quot;Small wonder.&quot;

&quot;I see.  She had help.&quot;

In the past the Kagato Group openly resisted Juraihelm&#39;s negotiations 
with Earth.  Romio could have easily exploited their hatred.  Sasami 
seethed with disgust.  &quot;Those selfish bastards!  Don&#39;t they understand 
that Romio hates Earth?&quot;

&quot;Those who hate only see their own pain.  It&#39;s unfortunate, Sasami, 
but calm down, we have to do something.&quot;

&quot;Right.  I&#39;ll distract her and you destroy the base.&quot;
Misao hit upon a thought.  &quot;Ano, maybe I should distract her, and you 
destroy the base.  Chances are, she may not remember you either, but 
she will remember me.  Besides, I fought her before.  We have a score 
to settle.&quot;  Misao broke into a predatory grin.

&quot;I see.&quot;  Sasami matched Misao&#39;s grin.

They slipped into an enclosed compartment to transform.  Pretty Sammy 
stared at Pixy Misa&#39;s outfit.  

&quot;I don&#39;t remember you having a cape!&quot;

&quot;~Silly Sammy!~  We&#39;re magical girls!  We can wear whatever we want.&quot;

&quot;Fine!  I&#39;ll change my look.&quot;

&quot;It looks like pajamas.&quot;  

(Blast it, I was thinking of something comfortable.)  &quot;Dammit!&quot;  She 
transformed back to her original outfit.  &quot;I&#39;ll think of something 
later.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s alright, Sammy.&quot;  Misa sauntered gracefully to look into her 
eyes.  &quot;I like it.&quot;

&quot;...&quot; 

Then they read the scroll to enlarge themselves.  With that done, 
Sammy hid herself while Misa brought Tetsuo with her into the room.  
&quot;Calling Mystics Multi Fire!&quot;

The cavern erupted into pandemonium as various objects in the room 
turned in to Love-love monsters and began attacking Romio.  Tetsuo 
transformed into a larger version of itself, and Misa rode him out of 
the cavern.  Romio finished off the monsters and flew after Misa.
Sasami ran to the base.  She looked up and saw the creature looking at 
her with its numerous eyes.  Its antennae stood up as if in question.  
Sasami waved her hands.  &quot;Stand back!&quot;  She wielded her baton.  

&quot;Magical powers of justice unite!&quot;  The baton sparked with energy.  

(Yosh!)

&quot;Pretty Coquettish Bomber!&quot;

The base disintegrated and the creature fell to the floor.  It lay 
there and its wings fluttered weakly.  

&quot;Are you hurt?&quot;  Sasami knelt by the creature which pulled its limbs 
away when she approached.  Green fluid dripped from some of its 
joints.

Sasami gulped and hoped that she was right.  She tore off pieces of 
her sleeves and bound them around the dripping joints.  The creature 
feebly tried to resist but eventually stopped.  Then Sasami gently 
picked it up.  The creature made a screeching noise.

&quot;Sorry if that hurt.  But we have to leave.  I may not be powerful 
enough to stop Romio, so we&#39;ll just have to get out of here.&quot;
Sasami ran as fast as she can.  She promised Misa to meet her at the 
crevice where they entered.  She ran to the crevice.  Suddenly, a 
large creature came in and turned towards her.  Sammy stopped abruptly 
and the creature screeched.  The large creature backed up about ten 
feet.  Sammy didn&#39;t know what to do so she just stood and watched it, 
while hoping Misa was faring better.  Then she heard movement behind 
her.  She turned around.

&quot;Misa!&quot;

&quot;Sammy!  ~Here I come!~&quot;  Misa reached out and grabbed Sammy by the 
waist.  She pulled her onto Tetsuo&#39;s back.  Tetsuo dove through the 
crevice and out of the mothership.  

&quot;Where&#39;s Romio?&quot;

&quot;Not too far!&quot;  

Just then an angry shriek filled the air.  A blast of magic exploded 
through the crevice.  

&quot;We musn&#39;t let her see us.&quot;  Misa guided Tetsuo out of sight of the 
crevice.  &quot;She can paralyze you on sight, even from a viewscroll.&quot;

&quot;Wow, you learned that from fighting her?&quot;

&quot;No, from Ramia.&quot;  Misa smiled inwardly.  &quot;It&#39;s amazing what soul 
gazing can do.&quot;

&quot;Eeee!  We&#39;re being followed!&quot;
