Misao sat in her bedroom combing her hair when she smelled the faint 
scent of cherry blossoms.  (Ah, it has finally bloomed.)  Misao went 
to the window and opened it.  The cherry blossom tree nearby had just 
bloomed and filled the night air with its gentle fragrance.  While 
Misao inhaled the scent, she heard rustling in the branches.  The 
moonlight outlined a human form.

&quot;Sa-Sasami!&quot;

&quot;Evening, Misao.  May I come in?&quot;

&quot;Yes, of course.&quot;  Misao turned to leave.  

&quot;Don&#39;t go, I&#39;ll be right there.&quot;  Sasami leapt from the tree and 
floated to the window.  Misao reached out and took her hands.

&quot;You can do that?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, with a bit of practice.  But I had to transform to get here 
fast.&quot;

&quot;Wow.  So...&quot;

&quot;I just thought I&#39;d pay you a visit, since it&#39;s been a few days.  I 
told my parents not to wait up for me.  We can talk all night if you 
want.&quot;

&quot;I... I would like that.&quot;  Misao looked up.

Sasami noticed that there seemed to be rings around Misao&#39;s eyes.  
&quot;Misao, have you been staying up late?&quot;

&quot;Ano... a little...&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Misao?  Were you hurt?  Are you sick?&quot;

&quot;No... just had a lot to think about.&quot;

&quot;Like what?  If something is bothering you, you can tell me.  Dad says 
that talking about your worries helps sometimes.&quot;

&quot;Well... eto...&quot;  Misao saw Sasami&#39;s worried face.  &quot;Ryo-Ohki&#39;s really 
nice, isn&#39;t he?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, he sure is cool.&quot;  Sasami wasn&#39;t sure why Misao was talking 
about Ryo-Ohki, but at least she was talking.  &quot;I really missed him, 
so I was glad to see him again.&quot;

&quot;Do you... do you like Ryo-Ohki?&quot;

&quot;Of.. of course, I do!  He was a big help when I first became Pretty 
Sammy.  So when that guard told us about his ship, well, I felt so 
sad... just like the time my hamster died.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;  Misao&#39;s heart soared and erupted in a fit of boisterous 
laughter.  

Sasami gave Misao a confused look.  &quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot;

Misao supressed a giggle.  &quot;The way you talk about Ryo-Ohki... it was 
like you were talking about a pet.&quot;

Sasami giggled.  &quot;I&#39;ve known him as a cat longer than I know him as a 
person.  I guess it takes getting used to.&quot;  Misao seemed more relaxed 
now.  &quot;Was there something about Ryo-Ohki that bothered you?&quot;

&quot;No, not really.&quot;

&quot;So what was worrying you?&quot;

&quot;Nothing, nothing at all.  I must&#39;ve drank too much tea.&quot;  Misao 
giggled.  She was relieved with Sasami&#39;s answer.

(Then why did you ask if I liked him?  ... Oh!  Is she?  But... I 
don&#39;t want to ask her directly.  I&#39;ll have to slowly bring up the 
topic.)  Sasami took a deep breath.  &quot;Misao, something&#39;s been 
bothering me lately, and I was hoping you could clear it up for me.&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;Ryo-Ohki once told me that magic becomes stronger when it reacts with 
a person&#39;s feelings.  I felt your magic reaching out to me in the 
labyrinth.  It was way stronger than the magic Pixy Misa used.  And 
when I heard your song, it felt like your very soul was calling me.  
But, there was a part of the song that seemed different.  There was a 
verse that went:

This is destiny so why pretend
Close your eyes, hold me once again

&quot;I get the feeling that it&#39;s not quite right.  I thought that &#39;hold 
me&#39; should be &#39;kiss me&#39;.  I was hoping you would tell me the right 
words.&quot;

Misao paled and looked away.  &quot;Ano, Ramia was there... and... I...&quot;
&quot;Misao...&quot;  Sasami put her hand on Misao&#39;s cheek and turned Misao&#39;s 
face toward her.  &quot;Later on I realized that I was able to sense your 
heart through your magic.  I am happy knowing how your heart felt.  
But, I still want to hear what you truly want to say.&quot;  Sasami leaned 
a little closer to bring their faces only inches apart.  &quot;Was it &#39;hold 
me&#39;, or... &#39;kiss me&#39;?&quot;  

Misao closed her eyes and whispered, &quot;Kiss me.&quot;  Misao waited in heart 
throbbing anticipation and felt a soft brush on her cheek.  Surprised, 
she opened her eyes and saw that Sasami had kissed her on the cheek.
Sasami pulled back smiling widely.  The expression on Misao&#39;s face 
clearly showed surprise, and possibly a bit of disappointment.  Sasami 
took a second to savor that look and tucked it away in memory.   Then 
she clasped her hands and chanted in Juraian.  

A pink light shown between them and when she drew them apart, two 
rings floated above her hands.  

&quot;These rings were created by the strongest binding magic.  One ring is 
for me, and the other for you, should you choose to accept it.  If you 
do, the ring will bind your life to mine and mine to yours.&quot;

Misao looked stunned.  With a tone of a used car salesman, Sasami 
added, &quot;And as an added bonus, you may have all the kisses you want.&quot;
Misao smiled widely, no, more like the menacing grin that Pixy Misa 
often wore.  She held out her hand and one of the rings floated to 
her.  &quot;With a bargain like that how could I refuse?&quot;  The ring slipped 
onto her finger.  &quot;I accept your magic, the fruit of your love, and 
may we forever be bound.&quot;

This time, Sasami was surprised with the response to the Juraian rite.  
&quot;How...&quot;

&quot;Ramia soul gazed into me, and Misa took a peek into hers.  She found 
out quite a bit.&quot;  Misao stepped closer to Sasami and whispered, &quot;I&#39;m 
ready to complete the seal.&quot;

Sasami slipped her ring onto her finger and took Misao into her arms.  
&quot;When I first became Pretty Sammy, Tsunami once told me that my life 
would never be the same again.  Now, I think I understand.&quot;

Misao touched her forehead with Sasami&#39;s and their lips sealed the 
magic.  When they parted, Misao whispered,   &quot;I&#39;m so glad I decided to 
come home.&quot;

&quot;Welcome home.&quot;
