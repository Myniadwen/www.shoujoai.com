<h1>A Pretty Sammy Story</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../psammy/index.html">Magical Girl Pretty Sammy</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/amazonessduo.html">Amazoness Quartet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>As the battle settled to a finish, Pretty Sammy stood as the victor.  Pixie 
Misa levitated not to far from the battle scene and watched.  She often 
wondered who Pretty Sammy was.  Even though she didn&#39;t really know her own 
identity she would at least like to know her enemies.  Maybe, just maybe if 
she found out before she was reverted back she would remember who Sammy was. 
  Just as Sammy started reverting back to normal Misa did as well.

        Pixie Misa was engulfed in a bright white light and her outfit disappeared 
and she was there in the middle of the sky glowing white and nude.  Her hair 
then reverted from blonde to black as her street clothes reappeared.  Misao 
got up off the ground.  Her headache was now gone.  She walked around and 
wondered how she had gotten in the alley that she was in.

        As Misao walked around the corner someone knocked her down.  The person 
stopped and it was Sasami.

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry Misao.&quot;  Sasami said, &quot;I was just looking for you.  I
heard that 
there was a battle going on in this area of town and I had gotten worried 
about you.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you, Sasami.  I&#39;m fine though.  I just don&#39;t remember how I got
back 
here.  I&#39;m sure that I&#39;ll remember though.&quot;

        Elsewhere...

        &quot;Damn that Pretty Sammy!  She is always getting in my way!&quot;  a
shadowed 
figure yelled in anger.  &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter though.  I&#39;ll get you when you 
least suspect it.  Be warned Pretty Sammy, you will not be a thorn in my 
side for much longer.  You can count on that.&quot;

        &quot;Master.&quot; Ramia said.

        &quot;What is it, Worm!&quot;

        &quot;If my warrior was allowed to stay in her other form a little while
longer, 
She could find out who Sammy is and Kill her before she can turn into Pretty 
Sammy.&quot;

        &quot;Your &#39;WARRIOR&#39; should be grateful that she is even able to turn into
Pixie 
Misa.  I&#39;ll give you and your &#39;warrior&#39; one more chance.  But be warned, If 
you fail me THIS time I will show NO mercy!&quot;

        &quot;Yes Master.  I am very grea&quot;

        &quot;SHUT UP AND LEAVE!!!!&quot;

        On that note Ramia vanished fearing what would happen to her if Misa failed 
again.

        A few days later on the Afternoon News.

        &quot;This is the third day in a row that monsters have been constantly 
attacking the city.  The Super Soldier Pretty Sammy Has put a stop to every 
attack to this point.  Police are baffled and can not detect any connection 
between any of the attack sites.  Some people have began to wonder, that 
with all the constant attacks, just how long Pretty Sammy can keep this up.  
This is Sara Ulrich with WKBM News at 1:00.  Signing off.&quot;

        &#39;Yeah.  Just how long can I keep this up?  Not long, I know that much.  I 
can&#39;t even get a good night&#39;s sleep anymore.&#39; Sasami thought to herself.  
This was the 3rd day that she has gone without any sleep at all.  Just then 
a little grey rabbit looking creature was hopping across the school yard.  
&#39;Oh no.  Not AGAIN.&#39;

        &quot;Sasami!  More Luvluv monsters have been spotted.  You must hurry.&quot;

        &quot;I can&#39;t do this much longer Ryo-ohki.  I&#39;m about to collapse as it is 
already.&quot;

        Elsewhere...

        &#39;My plan is working.  With Pretty Sammy exhausted, she won&#39;t have the 
strength to fight much longer.  I just need a little more time.&#39;

        &quot;Ramia!  The Master want&#39;s to see you right away.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you Rumia.  You may leave now.&quot;  On that note Rumia changed
into 
bird and flew off.

        Back in Japan..

        The battle raged on and for a little while it had seemed that the LuvLuv 
monster had an edge over Pretty Sammy.  With her last bit of energy she was 
able to launch her ultimate attack, Magical Resolution, and was able to put 
the LuvLuv monster at peace with it&#39;s inner self.

        &quot;Finally!&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m proud of you Sammy.  I&quot;m glad to see that you can still
fight.&quot;

        &quot;Ryo-ohki!  Did you have doubt?&quot;

        &quot;Well... no but you looked very tired.&quot;

        &quot;I am VERY tired. By the way you are a terrible liar.  I also had doubt, 
but I knew that I had to beat it.&quot;

        &quot;Bonjour Pretty Sammy.  You look very tired.  Do you think that you have 
enough strength to defeat me?&quot;

        &quot;PIXIE MISA!  I don&#39;t know if I have the strength but I know that I can 
always defeat you!&quot;

        &quot;Oh come now.  Even I know that you can&#39;t defeat me in your weakened
state. 
  However it wouldn&#39;t be any fun if you just up and surrendered.  So get 
ready Sammy.&quot;

        Misa charged at Sammy and hit her with unbelievable power.  Sammy knew that 
she was no match for Misa now but she just couldn&#39;t give up.  No.  She 
wouldn&#39;t give up.  When Misa had was getting ready to give the final blow, 
Sammy was surrounded with a bright magical light.

        &#39;No.  Not now.  I.. I can&#39;t change back now!&#39;  Sammy thought to herself in 
panic.

        At the same moment Misa was confused and blinded.  Ryo-ohki saw this and 
told Sammy to run for it but she was too weak to make a move.  The light 
disappeared and there lay, in Pretty Sammy&#39;s place, was a nude Sasami.  Her 
clothes soon materialized in place of where the Sammy outfit used to be.

        Misa regained sight to see Sasami laying where Pretty Sammy was at just a 
second ago.

        &quot;So this is who you are.  Get ready to die, Sammy!  Pixie Blade!&quot; 
Suddenly 
a short bladed sword appeared in Misa&#39;s hands and she thrust downward.

        &quot;NOOOOOOOOOO!  I can&#39;t, no, won&#39;t do this!&quot;  The blade disappeared
and Pixie Misa Stood up and turned around with tears forming in her eyes.  She, 
too, was then Surrounded in a brilliant flash of light as she started to 
revert back to Misao, Ramia appeared.

        &quot;What do you think that you are doing?!  You will kill this
annoyance!&quot;

        &quot;No!  I can&#39;t do this to my best friend!  You knew this all along didn&#39;t 
you!  You knew that Pretty Sammy was my best friend!&quot;  The reverting
stopped and she retransformed into Misao.

        &quot;So.  She will eventually betray your friendship.  It&#39;s best to destroy
her now, I mean, you will destroy her anyway.  It is better to get rid of her 
before she can hurt you.&quot;

        &quot;Never!&quot;  With that said, Misa took Sasami and left.

        Two hours later...

        &quot;Uhhhhhhh...  What happened?&quot; Sasami said still drowsy and beginning
to come around.

        &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you are safe now.&quot;  Sasami knew this voice but couldn&#39;t
place it.  Her vision cleared after a few moments and she looked around for her 
rescuer.  After another moment she found someone and jumped up ready for 
battle.

        &quot;Pretty Mutation Magical Re...&quot;

        &quot;You don&#39;t have to transform Sammy.  There is no one else here.  I saved 
you.&quot;  Suddenly Misa was covered in a brilliant flash of light and a few 
minutes later the light was gone and Misao stood in Misa&#39;s place.

        Sasami&#39;s eyes watered and she started crying.  Crying for her friend and 
crying for herself.  The whole time that she was having fun with her friend 
she was also fighting against her friend.  Fighting in battles that could 
kill her. She could have hurt Misao. She could have killed her. Misao meant 
too much to her to lose like that. She couldn&#39;t stand the thought of hurting 
her.

        &quot;Sasami, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Misao asked concerned. She blinked a couple
times, confused about what was going on. The last thing she remembered, she&#39;d been 
having another headache and then everything had faded away. Now she was with 
a very distraught Sasami. She quickly realized they were in her room, but 
she couldn&#39;t make out how she had gotten there, or when Sasami had arrived.

        Sasami through her arms around the black haired girl, throwing Misao off 
balance. Misao fell back onto the bed with Sasami still clutching to her. 
&quot;Oh Misao&#133; I&#39;m sorry&#133; I&#39;m so sorry&#133;&quot; Sasami sobbed. &quot;I should
have known. I should have done something. I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;

        Misao hugged Sasami, trying to comfort her. She didn&#39;t know what to do. 
Sasami was always the one who made her feel better when something went 
wrong. She wasn&#39;t sure how to calm her friend. &quot;Sasami, its alright. I
don&#39;t know what you&#39;re sorry about, but there&#39;s no reason to. I&#39;m fine. 
Everything&#39;s okay.&quot;

        The sound of Misao&#39;s voice in her ear sent shivers down Sasami&#39;s spine. She 
was locked in a close embrace with the black haired girl, Misao whispering 
soothingly to her. Sasami blushed a deep shade of red and tried to 
disentangle herself from her best friend. Sasami&#39;s emotions overflowed as 
she sat there. The fear of what could have happened to her best friend. The 
sadness that she&#39;d almost hurt her, the relief that maybe now they wouldn&#39;t 
have to fight anymore. And something else. Some other feeling flowed through 
her. It was deep and warm and enveloped her like a soft blanket. &#39;What&#39;s 
going on?&#39; she thought to herself. Her torrid emotions had ripped down a 
barrier inside her, pouring forth emotions she&#39;d hidden, even from herself. 
Things she&#39;d pretended not to notice, not to care about. She sat up and 
stared at the wall of Misao&#39;s room. &#39;Why do I have to pick now to fall in 
love?&#39; Sasami asked herself angrily. &#39;And with Misao? How could I be in love 
with Misao?&#39; Sasami took a deep breath while Misao looked on, confused. &#39;I&#39;m 
just being over emotional right now. I&#39;m sleep deprived and I&#39;m just happy 
she&#39;s alright.&#39; She looked back at the black haired girl. Misao was looking 
at her worriedly with her gentle aqua eyes. Sasami turned back towards the 
wall.

        &quot;Sasami? Are you okay?&quot; Misao asked nervously. &quot;What&#39;s going
on?&quot;
        The blue haired girl smiled warmly at her friend. &quot;I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m just glad
things are working out now. I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t explain what&#39;s going on right 
now, but I will. Someday I&#39;ll explain. I promise.&quot; Misao nodded weakly.
&quot;I should go for now. I&#39;ll call you tonight. Be careful, Misao.&quot; Sasami hugged
the other girl tightly before smiling and heading to the door of the room.

        Misao wrung her hands, still worried. &quot;I will, Sasami. I hope you feel 
better.&quot;

        &quot;I think all I need is some sleep and I&#39;ll be back to normal,&quot; Sasami
said.  She waved to Misao and headed downstairs to the door. Sasami sighed deeply 
after she got outside. She squinted as her eyes adjusted to the sun light. 
She wanted to go back in, to see Misao again, but she needed to get some 
sleep.  She tried to ignore all the thoughts invading her sleep hazy mind.
After what seemed an eternity, Sasami reached the house she shared with her 
mother and brother.  She stumbled up the stairs to her room. Ryo-ohki looked up in 
surprise when Sasami collapsed on the bed.

        &quot;Sasami? You&#39;re okay?&quot; Ryo-ohki hopped over to her side happily.
&quot;I was so worried about you!&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Sasami mumbled, her eyes half closed.

        &quot;Where were you? I saw Pixie Misa take off with you, but I couldn&#39;t catch 
up in time. How did you escape?&quot;

        Sasami yawned and tried to make out what Ryo-ohki had said. &quot;Oh, no. I was
fine. Misa wouldn&#39;t have hurt me. She saved me.&quot; She lazily unbuttoned her 
shirt and threw it to the side, trying to pull the blankets up around her.

        &quot;She saved you?&quot; Ryo-ohki asked incredulously. Sasami just nodded and
rolled over. &quot;Sasami&#133;&quot; Ryo-ohki nudged the blue haired girl after
waiting for an answer.

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Ryo-ohki, but I&#39;m tired and I&#39;m confused. I need some sleep 
after all this. We can talk later, okay?&quot; Sasami smiled tiredly at the 
cabbit, trying to keep her eyes open.

        Ryo-ohki sighed. &quot;Sure. You deserve some sleep after all those LuvLuv 
monsters you stopped. Goodnight, Sasami.&quot; Ryo-ohki waited for a reply, but 
Sasami was already asleep.

***

        Sasami yawned and stretched as she woke up. She felt a lot better after the 
non-stop fighting she&#39;d dealt with over the past couple days. It was dark 
outside now. She had a hard time remembering what had been a dream and what 
was real. One thing stood out above all else, Misao. Her mind centered on 
the thoughts of her dark haired friend. Misao smiled at her in her mind&#39;s 
eye. Suddenly, the image shifted, the dark hair was now blonde. The 
beautiful aqua eyes were now pink. Sasami let out a silent sigh, remembering 
that her best friend was her worst enemy. But was she? She had saved her 
life. Maybe it showed just how deep their feeling were for each other, 
strong enough to get past the magic that cause Misao to be Pixy Misa.

        The blue haired girl blushed deeply. What was she thinking? Her heart beat 
had quickened while thinking of Misao. Just what was happening to her?
        
Stretching as she stood up, Sasami hopped off her bed. She glanced around 
for Ryo-ohki, but the cabbit was nowhere to be seen. She shrugged her bare 
shoulders and padded across the floor to her dresser. Pulling on her 
pajama&#39;s, she couldn&#39;t help but feel a stab of worry for her friend. Was she 
alright? What would happen to her now that she betrayed that strange lady 
she&#39;d been working for? Sasami bolted upright and grabbed for her phone. She 
pushed the speed dial button and paced nervously as she waited for an 
answer.

        &quot;Hello?&quot; a gentle voice answered.

        Sasami smiled at the sound of Misao&#39;s voice. The other girl had always been 
her very dear, best friend. She felt so relieved to know that she was okay.

        &quot;Hello?&quot; Misao repeated.

        &quot;Oh! Hi, Misao,&quot; Sasami said quickly. She leaned down, picking up her
discarded blouse.

        &quot;Sasami? How are you? I was worried about you&#133;&quot; Misao said softly.
        Sasami fell back on her bed, a blush on her cheeks and a smile on her lips. 

        &quot;Thanks, Misao. I&#39;m just fine. Actually, I was worried about you.&quot;

        &quot;Me?&quot; the purple haired girl asked in surprise.

        Sasami giggled. &quot;Yeah. Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;d protect you if anything 
happened, anyway,&quot; she said, her voice suddenly sounding serious. She 
promised to herself she wouldn&#39;t let anything happen to her friend. If she 
wasn&#39;t Pretty Sammy, then her friend wouldn&#39;t be in such danger. Misao never 
would&#39;ve been used as Pixy Misa. She owed it to her friend to watch out for 
her. And she couldn&#39;t live with herself if anything happened to Misao.
        &quot;Thank you, Sasami,&quot; Misao said after a short pause. &quot;I really
hope you&#39;re doing better.&quot;

        &quot;Yeah, I am. I got some sleep after I got home. I feel a lot better,&quot;
Sasami replied.

        &quot;That&#39;s great. You were acting kind of strange,&quot; Misao said
concernedly.

        Sasami sat up on the bed, crossing her legs. &quot;Strange?&quot; she asked 
worriedly. &#39;Am I acting strange around her? Did she notice I was?&#39;

        &quot;I think you were probably just tired,&quot; Misao said thoughtfully.

        &quot;Yeah, that was it,&quot; Sasami agreed hurriedly. &#39;That was all it was,
right?&#39;

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Sasami. I have to go,&quot;  the blue haired girl could hear
the regret in Misao&#39;s voice.
       
        &quot;That&#39;s okay. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow, Misao. Maybe we can go someplace
after school,&quot; Sasami said hopefully.

        &quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Misao answered happily.

        &quot;It&#39;s a date, then,&quot; Sasami heard herself say. She blushed as soon as
the words were out of her mouth.

        &quot;Sure. Bye, Sasami!&quot; Misao said, seeming not to notice her friend&#39;s
odd behavior.

        &quot;Sleep well, Misao,&quot; the blue haired girl said reluctantly. &quot;I
love you,&quot; she added as an afterthought.

        &quot;What?&quot;

        &quot;Nothing! Nothing! Umm&#133; Goodnight, Misao!&quot; Sasami hung up the phone
quickly before she could say anything else. After a glance at the phone, she tossed 
it to the side as if it were diseased. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; she said
aloud.

        The next day....

        &quot;Sure you can ask me anything Sasami.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you Mihoshi.  What do you do when you love someone but you aren&#39;t 
sure if they love you in the same way?&quot;
	
	&quot;Love?  Oh!  I&#39;m SO happy for you Sasami!  Who is it?  Has he said anything 
to you?  Have you two gone out on a date yet?&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;d rather not say who it is now and not for the other two.  Would you please 
answer my question.&quot;

	&quot;What question was that?&quot;

	&quot;What do you do when you love someone but you aren&#39;t sure if they love you 
in the same way?&quot;

	&quot;Oh.  Well I&#39;m not.&quot; Mihoshi stopped in midsentence when she heard the door 
knob turn and the door start to open.  Reflex had taken over when she reached for 
her gun and had it armed and ready, aimed for the spot right beside the door.  
&quot;FREEZE!&quot;  Ever since her and Kiyone had been robbed while they were sleeping, 
she has been training hard and improving her senses.

	&quot;Mihoshi, it&#39;s me, Kiyone.  Now put the gun down.&quot;

	&quot;Sorry Kiyone.  Did you have any luck?&quot;

	&quot;No.  Neither I nor the police have been able to find anything.  I honestly don&#39;t 
think that we&#39;ll see any of that stuff again.&quot;

	&quot;At least none of our stuff for the store was stolen.&quot;  Mihoshi then returned 
her attention back to Sasami.  &quot;As I was saying, I&#39;m not sure what to do.  I would 
tell that person how I felt and then do something special for them.&quot;

	&quot;What are you guys talking about?&quot; inquired Kiyone.

	&quot;Little Sasami here is in love.  She wants to know what to do so she came here 
to ask for advice.  Do you have any Kiyone?&quot;

	&quot;Sasami all I, or anyone else for that matter, can tell you is to do what your 
heart tells you to do.  The only other thing we can do is give you ideas.&quot;

	&quot;Thank you Mihoshi.  Thank you Kiyone.  I&#39;ll tell you how it turns out.&quot;  With 
that Sasami left.  Still as confused about her situation as ever.

	As she walked down the street she heard a load explosion to her left.  She ran 
as fast as she could to the next cross section and looked to her left.  There were 
flames and smoke everywhere.

	Sasami looked around her and saw that no one was around.  &quot;Pretty Mutation 
Magical Recall!&quot;  A bright flash of light engulfed Sasami and out came Pretty 
Sammy.

	At the scene of the explosion....

	&quot;Where the hell is Pretty Sammy!&quot; Ramia shouted.

	&quot;What do you want, Ramia?&quot;

	&quot;Ah, Pretty Sammy.  I want you to DIE!&quot;

	Sasami sweatdropped. She really didn&#146;t need this, especially not now. She was 
having enough trouble with her love life to worry about a maniacal magical person 
trying to kill her. &#147;Is there anyway we could possibly do this some other time?&#148; the 
blue haired girl asked pleadingly. 

	Ramia furrowed her brow angrily. &#147;How dare you mock me, Pretty Sammy. 
For that I&#146;ll have to make sure your death is drawn out. And very painful.&#148;

	The magical girl sighed. Things just never could be easy for her, could they? 
Pulling her wand up in front of her, she prepared for the attack. A flash of light 
appeared in Ramia&#146;s hand, quickly hurtling her way. The blue haired magical girl 
raised her wand in the air. &#147;Pretty Coquettish Bomber!!&#148; Energy surrounded 
Sasami as she used her strongest attack, trying to force her concentration on this 
rather than a certain dark haired girl that had been the focus of her thoughts as of 
late. The attack flew straight at the red headed woman. Sasami smiled 
triumphantly, but the victory was short lived. Sasami&#146;s smile faded away as she 
saw her attack rather than hit the magical woman, head right through her. Her 
mind reeled with the implication. &#147;And illusion?&#148;  Sasami whirled around, her 
eyes wide in horror, but it was too late.

&#147;Die.&#148; Ramia grinned, energy lashing out at the bane of her existence. She would 
finally get what she wanted, the end of Pretty Sammy.

Sasami stood trapped like a deer in headlights, the energy seeming to move in slow 
motion towards her. She closed her eyes tightly, her arms going in front of her in 
reflex. She knew it would do her no good, but she also knew there was nothing she 
could do. Before the blast could hit, two arms wrapped around her waist and leapt 
off with her. The energy hit right were Sasami had been standing. Her eyes slowly 
opened when she realized she was still alive. She took a deep breath, her hands 
going across her body, making sure she was okay. Looking up to her rescuer, she 
was shocked by the sight. The girl was slightly taller than her, long feathery 
blonde hair falling to around her shoulders. Sasami could feel some of the dark 
purple, almost black leather of the girl&#146;s costume against her. The girl&#146;s hands 
were still around her waist, holding her close. The background seemed to fade 
away for Sasami, everything gone except this beautiful girl that rescued her. 
&#145;Misao and Pixy Misa are the same person. She must really care about me, too, 
then.&#146; The thought that Misao  had come to her rescue in a sense sent a tingle up 
and down Sasami&#146;s spine. Before she knew what she was doing, the blue haired 
magical girl leaned forward, her soft lips brushing against her rescuers. That 
moment, those soft lips against her own, the whole moment felt truly wonderful. It 
was more magical than anything magic she&#146;d done as Pretty Sammy. 

Pixy Misa&#146;s eyes went wide as saucers as she felt Pretty Sammy kiss her. She froze, 
unsure of what to do for once in her life as Misao&#146;s other personality. Her hands 
tensed against Sammy&#146;s sides, but that just spurred the blue haired girl on, making 
her kiss the blonde deeper. Misa&#146;s eyes started to fall closed, not knowing how to 
stop what was happening. Not wanting to. Misa barely shook herself from her 
trance in time to drag Sasami out of the way of another attack. The blonde feigned 
anger as she turned to the blue haired girl, too confused by what had happened to 
actually deal with it right now. &#147;What are you trying to do, Sammy? Get us killed? 
You want to kiss, you wait till we&#146;re not about to die. That does put a damper on 
my plans for the day, you know.&#148; 

Sasami looked down, blushing profusely. What had she just done? Why? She just 
hadn&#146;t been able to help herself. It had felt so good, so right. Even if this was her 
former rival, she was just as much in love with her as Misao. They were the same 
person, even if she did act differently as them. &#147;Sorry&#133;&#148; she said sadly, barely in a 
whisper.

The blonde grinned reassuringly. &#147;Worry about it later, Sammy. And if we do 
make it out of this alive, maybe I&#146;ll let you try again.&#148; She winked, drawing a 
blush from the blue haired girl. She laughed as she looked around for Ramia. She 
always did enjoy teasing the other magical girl. As long as she didn&#146;t have to 
worry about the implications of the kiss. It wasn&#146;t half bad. Kinda good, actually.. 
Misa&#146;s mind started to wander back to it before she spotted her former master. 
&#147;Pixy Sexy Fire!!&#148; She yelled, the blast flying towards Ramia. 

Ramia faded out of the way just in time. Reappearing further off, she scowled. 
&#147;You traitor! I&#146;ll kill you as well.&#148; After a moment, she added, &#147;The next time we 
meet.&#148; She turned around, fading away again. 


The two magical girls stood in silence for a long moment. Now that the battle was 
over and done with, Sammy&#146;s little kiss earlier came to the surface in both of their 
thoughts. Pretty Sammy turned to Pixy Misa, hoping to find out what the blonde 
girl thought of it. But Misa had a trump card to play. Besides, this wasn&#146;t her 
problem. She was the happy outgoing one. She&#146;d let her other side deal with it, 
even if she wouldn&#146;t remember. Dipping backwards, the leather clad magical girl 
fainted. 

Shifting back to normal from Pretty Sammy, Sasami sighed miserably. It figured 
that it would turn out like this. Things never could be easy, could they? Of course, 
Tsunami wouldn&#146;t have chosen her as the earth&#146;s champion if she didn&#146;t believe in 
her. But then again, this scenario probably wasn&#146;t something she&#146;d been chosen 
for. &#147;Misao-chan? Misao-chan, are you alright?&#148; Sasami asked, shaking her friend 
softly. 

&#147;Hmm?&#148; Misao blinked her aquamarine eyes tiredly, trying to focus. It took her a 
moment before she could make out Sasami&#146;s worried face looking down at her. 
&#147;Sasami-chan? Owww&#133;.&#148; She held her head as she tried to sit up but Sasami 
pushed her back down. 

&#147;Wait until you feel better first. I don&#146;t want you to hurt any more than you already 
do. I know how sick you can get.&#148; Sasami bit her lip as she watched her dark 
haired best friend lying on the floor with a pained look on her face. She really 
wished there was something she could do about Misao&#146;s poor health. They had 
first met when Sasami had helped her get to the nurse&#146;s office. Even after all this 
time, it still scared her to see the poor girl wracked with pain like that. 

&#147;I love you, too.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148; Was her mind playing tricks on her? She had just heard Misao mutter 
something, right? She really needed more sleep after all of the running around 
she&#146;d been doing lately. All this stress really wasn&#146;t good for her. She was likely to 
crack soon at this rate. &#147;Did you say something?&#148;

Misao shook her head quickly, rolling onto her side. A scarlet blush colored her 
pale cheeks as she looked off. &#147;No, I didn&#146;t say anything, Sasami-chan. I didn&#146;t say 
anything at all.&#148; The nervous butterflies feeling in her stomach was so bad that she 
thought she was going to be sick. She closed her eyes as the setting sun started to 
hurt them. She wished that Sasami would just take her home soon so everything 
could go back to the depressing way of things. Then she wouldn&#146;t have to worry 
about these things at the very least and that sick feeling would go away. Her eyes 
fluttered open as a pair of arms encircled her waist and helped prop her up. Pretty 
pink eyes and cute freckles along with a little light blue at the corners of her vision 
greeted her. Her blush grew deeper as Sasami looked deeply at her. &#145;She smells 
wonderful. I feel so warm and safe in her arms. I always do. I wish she&#146;d never let 
go.&#146; Internally pushing those thoughts away, she continued thinking to herself. &#145;I 
hope she does let go soon. Otherwise I don&#146;t think I&#146;ll be able to pretend 
everything&#146;s the way it used to be. I don&#146;t know if I could handle anymore 
changes.&#146;

Sasami noticed Misao stiffening up in her grasp after a moment. &#145;Why&#146;s she so 
nervous all of a sudden? She was starting to relax just a moment ago. Am I scaring 
her?&#146; Shaking her head, Sasami never took her eyes away from Misao&#146;s big, 
frightened aquamarine ones. Her soft body barely moved, feeling like a scared little 
animal in her arms. Misao&#146;s breathing was very slow, as if she was trying to not 
bring any attention to herself. &#145;If I heard right, she must be scared about the whole 
thing. She&#146;s always been kinda sad. And with how things are, this could risk 
losing her best friend and what we already have. I&#146;m not risking much because I 
know she&#146;ll understand. I know she&#146;ll stay my friend. I know&#133; So why am I so 
worried?&#146; the blue haired girl thought to herself. &#147;Misao-chan?&#148; One hand went 
higher up Misao&#146;s back as she brought her into a better sitting position. 

Misao swallowed nervously and nodded in acknowledgement. &#147;Hai, Sasami-
chan?&#148;

Licking her dry lips, Sasami tried to voice what was in her heart. &#147;Misao-chan, 
you&#146;re my very best friend. You&#146;ve always been there for me and I can&#146;t remember 
ever being happier than when I&#146;m with you. I don&#146;t want to fight against you 
because I care too much about you. You&#146;re very important to me. I just want to be 
with you always. Misao-chan, I love you.&#148;

Misao&#146;s cheeks went a deep shade of crimson as words caught in her throat. She 
was always so lonely, a scared little girl alone in the dark. But Sasami always filled 
up that darkness for her. She took away that deep loneliness. She was the only real 
important thing in her life. She was her reason to keep going, her reason to hope 
when all seemed lost, her reason to look toward tomorrow when her mother wasn&#146;t 
going to be home and she had cram school to get to. But all that came out was a 
meek, &#147;I love you, too.&#148; That was enough. 

Sasami&#146;s face lit up as she hugged Misao tightly. &#147;Oh, Misao-chan!&#148; A warm 
feeling quickly surpassed any nervous ones that had been inside her as the girl in 
her arms began to hug her back. All of her unfounded worries and the torment this 
had caused her all melted away in the beautiful dark haired girls hands. She felt 
Misao bury her head against the crook of her neck, an altogether pleasant 
sensation. She held her close, still on her knees.

Close to tears, Misao clutched onto Sasami like a life preserver in the choppy 
waters of her life. But now she could feel some of her faith returning. Things 
would work out. Because no matter what happened, she&#146;d be with Sasami. 
Whatever else got thrown in her way wouldn&#146;t matter as long as she could be in 
her arms. &#147;Thank you so much, Sasami-chan. I never thought..&#148;

Sasami cut her off with a soft kiss, her eyes closed as she relished the soft feel of 
Misao&#146;s lips against her own. The dark haired girl just sat there shocked for a 
moment, Sasami&#146;s cheeks reddening in embarrassment. 

No longer able to form coherent thought and drowning in a sea of emotion, Misao 
returned the kiss. Yes, everything would be alright from now on. &#145;Just never let me 
go. Never set me free from you.&#146;
