Rumiya poured over scrolls from the library.  After a day of waiting, 
he began to study spells in the Healing Arts.  It had been three days 
now, since he returned to Juraihelm, and there was still no news from 
Tsubaru.  He sat back in his chair and sighed.

* Bang! *

Suddenly, his door opened with a slam.  His sister stood in the 
doorway and her eyes locked in on him.

&quot;R-U-M-I-Y-A!&quot;  screamed Ramia.

She kicked hard.  Rumiya barely managed to transform into a shock 
absorbing body as her kick connected.  Ramia stood panting in the 
middle of the room while he scraped himself off his now cracked wall.

&quot;Sis!  Wha-what did I do?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all your fault!  If you had cured Pretty Sammy, I wouldn&#39;t have 
to go to Misty Mountain!&quot;

&quot;But Sis!  I can&#39;t heal!  And why do you have to go to Misty 
Mountain?&quot;

&quot;The High Priest thinks that curing Sammy is important enough to risk 
finding the Scroll of Lost Lore.  A spell of Reversal is in it.  The 
astrologers agree that the alignment of the stars are auspicious for 
locating Misty Mountain, which protects the Scroll through space and 
time.&quot;

&quot;And you have to go?&quot;

&quot;Tsunami wanted to, but she&#39;s Queen, so I had to offer to do it.&quot;

&quot;Wow!  I didn&#39;t know you were that strong!&quot;

&quot;Idiot!  I was candidate for Queen!  Anyway, the council agreed, so 
pack up!&quot;

&quot;Eh?  I&#39;m going too?&quot;

&quot;If I have to go through this, so will you!  Meet me at the Maple 
courtyard by noon.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sis!&quot;

Ramia stomped out of his room, and Rumiya relaxed back into his normal 
body.  Then he began to pack.

Ramia marched noisily to her tower.  She paused in her tracks when she 
noticed Tsunami by the entrance.

Ramia made a curt bow.  &quot;Greetings, your Majesty.  How may I be of 
service?&quot; 

Tsunami pinched her cheek.  &quot;Oh, so formal!&quot;

Ramia took a step back and rubbed her cheek.  &quot;Stop that!  Why in 
kami&#39;s name are you here?&quot;  

&quot;I just wanted to wish you good luck.&quot;

&quot;With you wishing me so, I just might need a lot of luck.  If it 
wasn&#39;t for this kindred spirit of yours, I wouldn&#39;t have to do this.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m even more grateful that you are doing this for Sasami&#39;s sake.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t it Sammy?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes.  It is Sammy.&quot;

&quot;By the Balance, at least get her name right.  Now get out of my way, 
I have to pack.&quot;  Ramia pushed Tsunami aside and unlocked her door.

&quot;Ramia?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Thank you, and may the stars guide you.&quot;

&quot;Huh.&quot;

Ramia entered and slammed the door.  She wasn&#39;t sure why she acted so 
rude.  Perhaps it was the absence of that imperial glow which caused 
her to lose her usual cool demeanor.  The glow lent a regal presence 
to an otherwise plain and carefree Tsunami.  The aura around Tsunami 
felt different, as if a residue of some other spell lingered.  
Glow or no glow, Tsunami always seemed to infuriate her with her 
childish, airheaded manner despite all the times she told her to act 
like a Queen.  Ramia sighed in frustration and hurriedly went upstairs 
to pack.


Misao sat by Sasami&#39;s bed.  It had been a week since Rumiya had left 
for Juraihelm.  She had visited Sasami everyday.  When no one was 
around, she told her stories and played some of her recorded recitals 
on her portable tape player.  Sometimes, she sang to her softly, first 
with lullabies, then some of the songs she had written.  She hoped 
that in her heart, Sasami would hear and wake.  And so she sang.

We don&#39;t every have to cry or fight
Something tells me we can make it right.
Enough of wandering far and wide
I just can&#39;t forget you though I&#39;ve tried

This is destiny so why pretend
Close your eyes kiss me once again
I&#39;ll always be the only one you need
So go where your deepest longing leads.

Sometimes as she sat there holding her hand, she almost felt Sasami&#39;s 
hand move.  But she wasn&#39;t sure, so she dismissed it as her 
imagination.  

Misao glanced at the clock.  Visiting hours would be over soon, and 
she would have to leave Sasami.  Misao sighed and stood up.  Her heart 
skipped a beat when she seemed to feel Sasami&#39;s fingers close on hers.  
She stopped moving for a moment and waited.  She let go after few 
seconds.  

Misao turned away to pick up her bag when suddenly a flash of light 
came from the window.  Blinded by the light, she put up her arms and 
crouched.  When the light faded, she heard a something heavy hit the 
floor.

&quot;Sis!  You&#39;re heavy!&quot;

&quot;Idiot!  Can&#39;t you at least &#39;port on your feet?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m still learning!&quot;

Misao&#39;s eyes widened in recognition of that voice.  &quot;Rumiya!&quot;  She 
called out and stood up.  Then she froze in her tracks when she saw 
Rumiya&#39;s companion, a strange woman who smiled at her.  Unconsciously, 
she started backing away toward the door.  Her heart pounded in her 
chest and she felt fear like she never felt before.  Before she could 
blink, this woman caught her chin and held her eyes.  The woman&#39;s eyes 
bored into her.  She felt like this woman could read her every 
thought. 

&quot;Well, if it isn&#39;t Misao.  You&#39;ve grown quite nicely.&quot;

&quot;Sis!  Don&#39;t scare her!  And don&#39;t force her to be Misa anymore!&quot;
Ramia did not respond.  Rumiya waited for a moment and realized to 
late that Ramia was focusing a spell.

&quot;Sis!&quot;

&quot;Idiot.&quot;  Ramia&#39;s voice was unusually soft.  &quot;It&#39;s not Misa we need.  
It&#39;s her.&quot;

&quot;Please... please let me go.&quot;  Misao shivered with fear as she 
haltingly pled.  She tried to turn away but her body didn&#39;t move.

&quot;I&#39;m not done yet.&quot;  

Rumiya gaped.  (A Soul Gaze!)  He had never seen Ramia use it and was 
alarmed at the amount of spirit chi gathered about Ramia.

As the woman stared into her eyes, the room blurred into grayish space 
and she floated in it.  The woman&#39;s eyes were floated in front of her.  

&quot;Sammy is trapped in a labyrinth of binding magic.&quot;  The woman&#39;s voice 
echoed through her mind.  &quot;She had fought against it and her soul was 
lost within its folds.  I can provide a way to protect you from the 
binding, and to break some of the barriers.  But you will have to help 
her out.&quot;

&quot;Why me?&quot;

&quot;Your innate magic will absorb some of the defenses of the labyrinth.&quot;  
The eyes softened.  &quot;Doesn&#39;t your heart cry out for her release?&quot;

&quot;Yes...&quot;

&quot;Magic is strongest when your heart flows with its energies.  If your 
heart calls out for her, then surely your magic will help her find 
you.&quot;  Then the eyes hardened.  &quot;But if you fail, you will be lost as 
well, and your body will not wake.  Do you want to do it?&quot;

&quot;Yes!  Yes!  Please help me find Sasami!&quot;  

The eyes widened at Sasami&#39;s name.  (So her true name IS Sasami...)  
Misao heard the woman whisper and wondered who she was.  Suddenly, an 
answer came to her.  (Ramia...)

The eyes hardened again and Misao felt an invisible force push her 
back.  &quot;Don&#39;t try that, missy.  If I catch you poking around, I&#39;ll 
leave you in the labyrinth.&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;ll ask Rumiya to help!&quot;

&quot;Fool!  He isn&#39;t powerful enough and his magic is not aligned to 
yours!  I am your only choice.&quot;

An answer came again.  &quot;You&#39;re my kindred spirit?!&quot;

&quot;Back off!&quot;  Misao felt the force increase.  &quot;Yes, I am Ramia, Chief 
Magistrate of Juraihelm.  YOUR kindred spirit.  You should really be 
more respectful.&quot;  The eyes faded and everything blurred to a brighter 
light.  When her vision cleared, she was standing in Sasami&#39;s room.  
Rumiya stood nearby, and was anxiously watching her.  &quot;Misao!  Are you 
alright?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I think.&quot;  Her eyes found Ramia slumped on a chair.  Her eyes 
were closed and she looked very tired.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong with her?&quot;

&quot;She had you in a Soul Gaze.  Using it consumes a lot of spirit 
energy.&quot;

&quot;Idiot.&quot;  Ramia whispered.  &quot;I&#39;ve been doing all the work, that&#39;s why.  
I can Soul Gaze anytime.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, sorry, Sis!  Please don&#39;t get mad!&quot;  

&quot;Then don&#39;t say stupid things.&quot;  Ramia&#39;s head lolled slightly to the 
side.

&quot;Misao, we need your help again.&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;Sis and I have been traveling, so we&#39;d like to get some rest.&quot;

&quot;Oh.  You can rest at my apartment.  If you don&#39;t mind a bit more 
walking.  But your clothes... people might stare.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t mind walking.  And I&#39;ll change our clothes.&quot;  Rumiya wove his 
hands over his robes and transformed them into a shirt and pants.  

&quot;Wow...&quot;  breathed Misao.

Rumiya smiled and placed his hands in front of Ramia.  &quot;Excuse me, 
Sis.  You have to wear Earth clothes.&quot;  

&quot;Zzzhhh!&quot;

(Oh, thank kami!  She&#39;s asleep.)  Rumiya wove his hands and Ramia&#39;s 
clothes transformed into a simple dress.  Her chair turned into a 
wheel chair.

&quot;That&#39;s so cool!&quot;  whispered Misao.  
Rumiya blushed at her praise.  He pulled Ramia&#39;s wheel chair in front 
of him.  &quot;I&#39;m ready.&quot;

&quot;Mm.&quot;  Misao nodded and led the way.
