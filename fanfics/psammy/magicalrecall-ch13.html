Ramia slouched on a nearby chair.  She felt tired and irritated.

&quot;Sis!&quot;  Rumiya was covering his eyes.

&quot;What?&quot;  

&quot;Do something about them!&quot;  Rumiya pointed to Misao and Sasami.

&quot;I didn&#39;t do that.  If you want to give them clothes, be my guest.&quot;

&quot;Sis!&quot;

Misao pulled back and looked down.  She and Sasami were stark naked, 
so both turned to Ramia.  

&quot;I didn&#39;t do it.  Rumiya can make some clothes for you.&quot;  Ramia 
directed her voice to Rumiya.  &quot;Well, hop to it.&quot;

Rumiya groped for the blankets on the bed and transformed them into 
Juraian robes.  Then he turned toward the wall.  Misao and Sasami 
gratefully put them on.

&quot;Tsk.  Tsk.  Rumiya, I didn&#39;t know you followed the latest fashions.&quot;  
Ramia said teasingly.  

&quot;They&#39;re for girls!&quot;

&quot;They quite popular with men too.&quot;

&quot;Sis!&quot;

&quot;Heh.&quot;  Ramia stood up.  &quot;We have to go.  Everyone gather around.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s going on, Misao?&quot;

&quot;Juraihelm is in danger, and they need our help.&quot;

&quot;Oh.  Alright.&quot;  Sasami stepped in the space indicated by Ramia.  
Misao stood nearby.

As Ramia&#39;s magic wove around them, Sasami reached for Misao&#39;s hand.  
Misao turned and smiled at her.  As her long slender fingers entwined 
around hers, Sasami was glad to remember all that she had long 
forgotten.  

Ramia teleported them into her tower, specifically in a room aligned 
with her teleport spell.  She hated to admit it, but she was 
exhausted.  She barely managed to maintain her confident poise after 
they materialized in the room.

&quot;Welcome to Juraihelm&quot;, she said to no one in particular.  She turned 
to Rumiya.  &quot;Take them to the Queen.&quot;  

&quot;What about you, Sis?&quot;

&quot;My job is done.  Go!&quot;

Rumiya nodded in understanding and ushered Misao and Sasami out the 
room.  Ramia closed her eyes as her body pitched forward, to accept 
the numbing coldness of sleep.  The impact of stony floor did not come 
as unexpected arms caught her fall.  She felt herself carried 
downstairs.  As her head nestled on soft cloth, she smelled the faint 
scent of Royal Teardrops.  Her hand clutched the fabric and tears 
welled up from her eyes.

She was laid on a bed and a blanket pulled over her.  A cool hand 
brushed on her forehead and familiar magic began to ease the soreness 
of her muscles.  She gladly received it and fell asleep.

Rumiya led Misao and Sasami to the door that exits Ramia&#39;s tower.  He 
opened the door and was about to go out when the tower shook.  He 
looked out and saw fiery debris falling from the sky.   The faint 
outline of what might be Juraian ships dotted the sky.  Strange 
flickering shapes hovered around the ships and struck them with 
intense beams of light.  Rumiya backed up into the protection of the 
tower.

&quot;We&#39;re under attack!&quot;  

&quot;Are we too late?  Can we still help?&quot;  asked Sasami.

&quot;I don&#39;t know!  We have to meet the Queen.  She&#39;ll know what to do.  
We have to get to the Throne room, but I don&#39;t want to risk of getting 
hit while we cross the courtyard.&quot;

&quot;How far is the Throne room?&quot;  asked Misao.

&quot;It&#39;s that tall castle over there.&quot;

&quot;Eh?  So far?!&quot;  exclaimed Sasami.

Rumiya felt a vibration on his wrist.  His communicator sparkled with 
an incoming message.  He touched it with his finger to authenticate 
receipt.  &quot;Rumiya here.&quot;

&quot;Hey, Rumiya, it&#39;s Ryo-Ohki.  I&#39;m right above the tower.&quot;

&quot;You are?&quot;

&quot;Yep.  I&#39;m here to take you to the Queen.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s ... that&#39;s great!  Can you make it to the dock?&quot;

&quot;On the south side right?  Yeah, I see it.&quot;

&quot;Okay, we&#39;ll meet you there.&quot;  He faced Misao and Sasami.  &quot;Ryo-Ohki&#39;s 
here!&quot;  

&quot;Ryo-Ohki... &quot;  Sasami&#39;s eyes widened in recognition.  &quot;Really?  
Where?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s waiting at the dock to take us to the Queen.  Come on, this 
way!&quot;  Rumiya rushed up the stairs.

&quot;But how did he know?&quot;  Misao&#39;s question lay unanswered as they rushed 
to the dock.  

A ship with dark spikes waited at the end of the platform.  Rumiya 
stopped near one of the spikes and beckoned Sasami to enter.  &quot;Just go 
through it.&quot;

Sasami and Misao did so and were amazed to find themselves in what 
appeared to be the ship&#39;s bridge.  A young man with brown and white 
hair waved to them.  Three seats morphed from the floor near where he 
stood.

&quot;Everyone strap in!  It may get bumpy.&quot;  Ryo-Ohki called out from the 
top of a raised seat.

&quot;Am I glad to see you, Ryo.&quot;  Rumiya made himself comfortable as the 
seat molded around him.  He turned to Misao and Sasami.  &quot;Are you 
ready?&quot;  Rumiya&#39;s eyes bulged out.

Sasami was reclined nicely and watched a viewscroll.  &quot;Wow, is this a 
soap opera?&quot;

Misao was serenely sipping tea from an extended tray while the lower 
part of the seat raised her feet and was massaging them.  &quot;Mmm.  
Delicate, with tones of peach...&quot;

&quot;Hey!  This isn&#39;t a field trip!  Ryo said to strap down.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot;

&quot;Me too.&quot;

&quot;Yosh, let&#39;s go!&quot;  Ryo-Ohki&#39;s hands manipulated the globes under his 
hands.  The ship surged up and forward.  Thirty seconds later, the 
ship stopped.  &quot;Okay, we&#39;re here.&quot;  

&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot;  Misao and Sasami asked in chorus.

&quot;Yep.&quot;  He got off the seat and opened a portal.  &quot;The Queen is 
waiting.  Follow me, please.&quot;  

They followed Ryo-Ohki through the Palace and entered the Throne room.  
Upon their entry, Tsunami rushed to them with open arms.  She gathered 
them to her.  

&quot;You came!  Both of you are so grown up!&quot;

Misao and Sasami sweatdropped.  (It&#39;s been ten years.)
Someone nearby cleared his throat.  &quot;I hate to interrupt, your 
Majesty, but we&#39;re still at war.&quot;

&quot;Yes, quite true.&quot;  Tsunami gestured towards the elderly gentleman.  

&quot;This is Sir Yosho, Warmaster of Juraihelm.  He will tell you of the 
current situation.  Please listen.&quot;

&quot;Errhm.&quot;  Yosho took a deep breath to tuck his stomach in.  His 
shoulders pulled back to accentuate his broad chest.  &quot;The enemy, 
She-who-will-not-be-named, has demanded that Her Majesty surrender her 
Throne.   Her Majesty refused, and the enemy released has a hive of 
alien creatures.&quot;  He gestured towards a large viewscroll which showed 
winged hornet like ships swarming from a gigantic ship.   My 
tacticians guess that she has control over these creatures.  They are 
very formidable and appear have some magic resistance.  Our fleet has 
sustained considerable lo... damage.  We continue to destroy them, but 
more come from the mothership.&quot;  He paused for effect.  The sound of 
fighting could be heard faintly.  &quot;My tacticians have noted that the 
creatures appear to attack only vessels which emit magic.  If we were 
to send a small team which can infiltrate the mothership and wrest 
control from the enemy, we may be able to turn the tide.&quot;  He turned 
to Misao.  &quot;Will you help us, Amano-san?&quot;

&quot;Just me?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, and what about me?  If Misao is going, then I&#39;ll go too!&quot;

&quot;And you are?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m Pretty Sammy!&quot;  Sasami posed.

&quot;So you&#39;re a magical girl, too?&quot;

&quot;Yeah!&quot;

&quot;Very well, you may go if Amano-san says so.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;  Sasami gave Misao a quizzical look and Misao returned the 
same look.  Misao&#39;s eyes told her that she didn&#39;t know why he only 
remembered Pixy Misa and not Pretty Sammy.

&quot;I&#39;ll go if Sasami comes with me.&quot;  Then it occured to her.  &quot;But how 
will we get to the mothership?&quot;

Yosho held out his arm.  A large eagle like bird flew down and perched 
on it.

&quot;This is Tetsuo.  He will fly you there.&quot;

&quot;Wow, he&#39;s that strong?&quot;  asked Sasami.

&quot;He can carry you if you were shrunk.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot;  exclaimed Misao and Sasami in chorus.

&quot;Yes, you must both be shrunk because shrinking you will make it 
harder to sense your wands.  Then you must ride Tetsuo to the 
mothership.   When you get there, use him to find the enemy and 
determine how to stop her fron controlling these creatures.  Then find 
a safe place to transform into your magical form and recite this 
scroll to enlarge yourselves.  Using your magic, stop her!&quot;
Sasami sweatdropped.  &quot;You make it sound so easy.&quot;

Yosho laid his hands on their shoulders.  &quot;We&#39;re counting on you, Pixy 
Misa, and ... you.&quot;  He let the hand fall towards their ...
Sasami noticed and gulped visibly.

&quot;Warmaster!&quot;  

Yosho pulled away in irritation.  &quot;What is it, Ryo-Ohki?&quot;  He bit back 
saying &#39;brat&#39;.

&quot;If they are ready, allow me to escort them as far as I can.  I will 
shrink them and send them off with Tetsuo.&quot;

Despite his irritation, Yosho knew that Ryo-Ohki excelled in aerial 
combat.  &quot;Very well, see to it.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Warmaster!  Your Majesty...&quot;

&quot;My blessings to you all, and come back for tea!&quot;

&quot;I will.&quot;  Ryo-Ohki turned to Misao and Sasami.  &quot;Ready?&quot;

Misao and Sasami nodded.  &quot;Lead the way.&quot;
