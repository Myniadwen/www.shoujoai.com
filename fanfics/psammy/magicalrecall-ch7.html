Rumiya materialized in a sacred circle located in an abandoned shrine.  
He realigned the stones around the circle and walked over the stepping 
stones across a pond.  He tossed a few Juraian gemstones and recited 
the proper incantation to thank the guarding spirits of the temple.  
After he sensed their blessing, he left the shrine grounds.  He went
over to the nearest view of the city below and breathed deeply of the 
Earth&#39;s air.  He then searched for a small branch and trimmed off some 
twigs.  Then he tied a piece of cloth and some feathers on one end.  
He held it out vertically, and let it fall.  He noted its position.
(Ah, so that&#39;s where you are.)

With another incantation, and a whiff of colored smoke, Rumiya 
transformed into a bird and took off with the branch in his claws.
(At last, Amano-san, I can see you again.)

Misao sat by Sasami&#39;s bed.  The doctors were still trying to figure 
out Sasami&#39;s condition and were suggesting various tests to her 
distraught mother.  Misao looked at the various devices monitoring 
Sasami&#39;s heart and brain activity.  Everything seemed normal, except 
for an occasional erratic brain wave.  Misao sat in silence, watching 
the pattern of those waves.  She was disturbed from her reverie when 
she heard some scraping near the window.  She turned toward the window 
and saw an odd looking bird with rather colorful plumage.  She moved 
toward the window to shoo the bird aware when she felt its eyes gaze 
into her and held her attention.  She nodded in response, and walked 
out of the hospital as if in a dream.  She stopped under a tree and 
the bird flew nearby and gazed into her eyes again.  

Misao was startled to be outside.  (What happened?  I was in Sasami&#39;s 
room, wasn&#39;t I?)  She gasped in fear.  (Am I a sleepwalker?)  She 
heard a rustle of feathers.  A bird with iridescent blue plumage 
hovered before her.  

&quot;Birdie?&quot;

&quot;Misao-sama!&quot;

&quot;It is you!&quot;  Misao held out her arm and Rumiya gently landed on it.  

&quot;It&#39;s been a long time, Birdie.&quot;  Then something occurred to her.  &quot;You
can talk?!&quot;

Rumiya opened his beak in surprise.  &quot;Yes, I can.  I thought you 
knew.&quot;

&quot;I did?&quot;  Misao laughed nervously.  

&quot;I guess I forgot.&quot;

&quot;Misao-sama, I hate to say this, but we need your help!  We need Pixy 
Misa!&quot;

Misao&#39;s heart skipped a beat when she heard Misa&#39;s name.  &quot;Pixy 
Misa...&quot;  Her eyes grew round with realization.  &quot;I&#39;m Pixy Misa?!  
Since when?&quot;

&quot;About ten years ago.  Don&#39;t you remember?&quot;  Misao looked more afraid 
than confused.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Misao-sama.  My sis asked me to turn you 
into Pixy Misa and wreck havoc on Earth to prevent Tsuanmi from 
becoming Queen.  In the end, Tsunami did become Queen, but she was 
able to because you helped defeat She-who-must-not-be-named.&quot;  Rumiya 
looked earnestly into Misao&#39;s eyes.  &quot;But now, Juraihelm may be in 
peril, and I must ask Pixy Misa to help.  I won&#39;t force you, 
Misao-sama.  But I beg of you to please, please consider changing into 
Pixy Misa.  You are the only magical girl who can help.  Please, I beg 
of you!&quot;  Rumiya&#39;s head dipped as if he were bowing to Misao.
Misao calmed down a bit.  Birdie seemed very honest and sincere.  

&quot;What&#39;s your name, Birdie?&quot;

&quot;Umm, Ru-Rumiya.&quot;

&quot;Rumiya.  Rumiya, will it hurt turning into Pixy Misa?&quot;

&quot;No, it shouldn&#39;t, if you do it willingly.&quot;  Rumiya shut his eyes in 
contrition.  &quot;Once again, I&#39;m sorry for forcing you, Misao-sama!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just Misao.  Not Misao-sama.  Misao.  Please don&#39;t call me 
Misao-sama.  Neh?&quot;

&quot;Yes... Mi-Misao.&quot;  

&quot;Alright, I&#39;ll let you turn me into Pixy Misa.  But you must promise 
not to make me do bad things.&quot;

&quot;I promise, Misao-sa, erhm!  I promise.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot;  Misao took a deep breath.  &quot;I&#39;m ready.&quot;

Rumiya flew from Misao&#39;s arm and gazed into Misao&#39;s eyes.  His voice 
rang in her head, &quot;We need you, Pixy Misa... Come forth!&quot;  Her mind 
seemed to explode and she exclaimed in surprise.

There was a flash of multi-colored lights and when it faded, a blond 
girl clad in sleek leathers stood in its place.  The bird sighed in 
relief, only to squawk in surprise as a gloved hand throttled his 
neck.

&quot;R-U-M-I-Y-A!  Where in the seven hells were you?  I haven&#39;t been out 
in years!&quot;

&quot;Squa-aaack!&quot;  *Flap!  Flap* 

Finally, the gloved fingers let go.  Rumiya breathed several gasps, 
and wheezed.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Misa!  I haven&#39;t been allowed to visit Earth since I 
entered the Academy, and this is the first chance I got!&quot;

&quot;~Oh, please!~ Spare me your excuses.  Now that I&#39;m out, what are we 
doing?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s terrible, Misa!  First, the Balance got unbalanced, and then 
patrols report that She-who-must-not-be-named might be massing...&quot;

&quot;~What?~  Slow down, and tell me about the Balance.&quot;

Rumiya quickly recounted the incident in the Great Hall, and the 
deliberations of the magistrates.  He told of her of reports of a 
massing of forces just beyond Juraihelm&#39;s borders, and the suspicion 
that She-who-must-not-be-named may be involved.

&quot;So, I&#39;ve been sent here to find Earthlings who have the strongest 
magic.  And you came to mind, Pixy Misa.&quot;

&quot;~But of course!~  I am the most loveliest, formerly baddest magical 
girl on Earth!&quot;  Misa posed confidently with a victory sign.  &quot;We&#39;ll 
get rid of that She-what&#39;s-her-face for good!  ~Oh yes!~&quot;

&quot;Alright!  Let&#39;s go!&quot;  Rumiya turned to flap away when suddenly Misa 
yanked his tail feathers.  &quot;Squaack!&quot;

&quot;~Waitaminute!~  Let&#39;s go get Pretty Sammy!&quot;

&quot;Pretty who?&quot;

&quot;Pretty Sammy!&quot;  Pixy Misa whacked Rumiya&#39;s head.  &quot;Didn&#39;t you hear 
me?&quot;

&quot;Eh?  But there&#39;s only you, Misa, and the other girl, but she&#39;s 
kindred spirit to She-who-must-not-be-named, so she might betray us.&quot;

&quot;Idiot!  Pretty Sammy is Tsunami&#39;s kindred spirit.  We&#39;ll need her 
help.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t know that.  So where can we find her?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t know that?  After all those times you brought me out to 
fight her, you&#39;ve forgotten?  You&#39;re stupider than I thought!&quot;

&quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s over here, but we have to wake her up.&quot;

Misa led Rumiya outside Sasami&#39;s window.  Rumiya peared in.  &quot;That&#39;s 
Pretty Sasami?&quot;

&quot;~Yes!~  But she fainted and hasn&#39;t woken up.&quot;

&quot;So how do we wake her up?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.  I only know attack magic.  Can&#39;t you do something to 
help her?&quot;

&quot;Eto, I specialize in Transformation magic.  I know basic healing 
spells, which can only heal cuts.  Let me call my Sis.&quot;  

&quot;Eeeee!&quot;  The scream almost made Rumiya drop his communicator.   A 
nurse had entered Sasami&#39;s room and was staring at them.  &quot;Pi-Pixy 
Misa!  Help!&quot;  

&quot;~Alright!~  I&#39;m still popular as ever!&quot;
Rumiya cleared his throat.  &quot;Err, let&#39;s go somewhere less conspicous.&quot;

&quot;~Fine!~&quot;
