Ramia&#39;s face flickered into Rumia&#39;s communicator.  &quot;Rumiya!  I&#39;m very 
busy.  Make it quick.&quot;

&quot;Sis!  I found Pixy Misa and Pretty Sammy.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s good... eh, Pretty who?&quot;

&quot;Pretty Sammy, Tsunami&#39;s kindred spirit.&quot;

&quot;What?  Tsunami has a kindred spirit?  Ah, who cares!  Bring them here 
for a briefing.&quot;

&quot;Wait, Sis!  Pretty Sammy&#39;s sick, and I can&#39;t help her.&quot;

&quot;Sick?   Ok, send me your location, and a cleric will come over.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Sis!&quot;

Rumiya punched the coordinates and ended the call.   Misa tapped her 
foot impatiently.  &quot;Well?&quot;

&quot;Sis is sending a cleric.&quot;

&quot;~Great!~  When will he get here?&quot;

Suddenly, a portal opened above them and something hurtled through.  
Rumiya and Misa barely managed to dodge. * Whump! *

&quot;Ack!&quot;  came from a tangle of robes on the ground.  Rumiya and Misao 
watched in confusion as a braided head emerged from the tangle.  Their 
eyes met the newcomer&#39;s.  &quot;Is this Earth?&quot; chimed a small, high 
pitched voice.  

&quot;Yes.&quot;  answered Rumiya.  

&quot;Oh good.  I&#39;m Tsubaru.&quot;  Tsubaru got up and straightened the robes.  

&quot;Which of you is Rumiya?&quot;  

Pixy Misa walked up and whacked Tsubaru on the head. 

&quot;Ow!  What was that for?&quot;

&quot;~Duh!~  I&#39;m obviously a girl!  So that&#39;s Rumiya!&quot;  Misa pointed at 
Rumiya with her baton.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, ma&#39;am.  Ow!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not a ma&#39;am.  I&#39;m Pixy Misa!&quot;

&quot;Oh, so you&#39;re Pixy Misa.  I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s just that I&#39;ve never seen 
Rumiya, and androgynous fashion is the hype in Juraihelm.&quot;

&quot;Oh, really?&quot;  Misa snuck a sly look at Rumiya.  &quot;I wonder what you 
look like without the feathers.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a boy, ok!  And I look like one.&quot;

&quot;Really?  Lil missy here thought that you might look as lovely as me.&quot;

&quot;No, I don&#39;t!&quot;

&quot;Erhm, excuse me, but I&#39;m a boy.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot;  Rumiya and Misa stared at Tsubaru so closely, that Tsubaru 
took a step back.

Tsubaru blushed with embarassment.  &quot;Ano, I&#39;m suppose to heal someone, 
right?&quot;

Rumiya and Misa led Tsubaru to Sasami&#39;s room.  This time, Misa 
transformed back to Misao to prevent anyone from entering the room.  
Tsubaru pulled off Sasami&#39;s blanket and laid his hands on several 
parts of her body.

&quot;Do you have to do that?&quot;  Rumiya blushed as he watched Tsubaru&#39;s 
hands.

&quot;Yes.  Why?&quot;

&quot;Nothing.&quot;

Tsubaru laid his hands on Sasami&#39;s head.  His hands began to glow.  
They remained that way for about 15 minutes.  Then Tsubaru stepped 
away and flopped down on the nearest chair.  Rumiya rushed to his 
side.

&quot;Are you alright?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.  I don&#39;t think I can help her.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with her?&quot;

&quot;This doesn&#39;t seem like a normal illness.  It&#39;s more like she shut her 
mind and soul to the world.  I tried my best to reach her, but she 
seems to have strong defenses.&quot;

&quot;I see.  What can we do?&quot;

&quot;I can go back to Juraihelm and tell my master what I felt.  He will 
know what to do.&quot;

&quot;Alright.  I&#39;ll help you get back.&quot;

A look of surprise lit up Tsubaru&#39;s face.  &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t realize you 
were that powerful.&quot;

&quot;Err, no.  I&#39;m not.  We&#39;ll have to go outside the city to a shrine.&quot;

&quot;I understand.&quot;

&quot;I have to talk to Misao first.&quot;  Rumiya turned and brought Misao 
inside the room.

Misao listened to Rumiya&#39;s explanation.  &quot;When I return, I&#39;ll send you 
word and hopefully, I&#39;ll bring someone who can help.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Rumiya, Tsubaru.  I really appreciate your help.&quot;

Tsubaru blushed despite his weariness.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I couldn&#39;t do 
more.  Please don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll try to find help.&quot;

&quot;Goodbye for now, Misao.&quot;  Rumiya turned to Tsubaru and cast a spell 
to shrink him.  Then he picked him up with his claws and flew out the 
window.

Misao waved to them and turned to sit at Sasami&#39;s side.  She held her 
hand.  (Hang on, Sasami.  Help is coming.)

Once in Juraihelm, Rumiya escorted Tsubaru to see his master, and 
waited for him.  After 2 hours, Tsubaru emerged accompanied by an 
older cleric, who was probably his master.  Tsubaru cleared his 
throat.

&quot;My master and I reviewed my experience.  He may not be able to help 
either.  He will go to the Hall of Enlightenment and speak to the High 
Priest.  I will send word when he finds out anything.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot;  Rumiya bowed deeply.  &quot;Thank you for your help.&quot;

Tsubaru and his master bowed back.  Rumiya returned to his quarters 
and laid on his bed.  (Kami-sama, I hope they find something soon.)  
He silently prayed to all the kami of health, and in the process, fell 
Asleep.
