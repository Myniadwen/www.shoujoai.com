After Pretty Sammy and Pixy Misa left, the celebration continued over 
to the next few days.  When it was officially over, the people of 
Juraihelm began to rebuild the damage.  Tsunami did not hold court for 
a week and spent some of her spare time caring for her flowers in her 
private garden near her quarters.  She was watering a patch of Royal 
Teardrops when she heard knocking on her chamber door.  &quot;Come in.&quot;

Ramia entered.  &quot;Greetings, your Majesty.  May I have a word with 
you?&quot;

&quot;Ah, Ramia, welcome back.  Please come in.&quot;

Ramia wove her hands in a spell of Instant Replay which she had 
learned from the Scroll of Lost Lore.  If she guessed right, the spell 
would reveal the events that transpired in a certain space in time.  
Ramia directed the spell&#39;s energy to Tsunami&#39;s viewscroll.  The scroll 
flickered, and the barely discernable scene of Tsunami&#39;s room ten 
years ago appeared.  In the scene, a younger Tsunami lounged in her 
floating recliner as she watched the suspended viewscroll before her.  
It flickered with images of the people of Earth who are rebuilding 
their cities after the near devastation caused by one errant Juraihelm 
candidate, She-who-will-not-be-named.  With a languid wave of her 
hand, the scroll flickered, and showed a similar scene in a quaint 
Japanese town. Then the scroll flickered again, and showed a scene of 
armed gangsters pursuing a young girl with blue hair and pink eyes.  
Tsunami watched the scene in apparent distaste.  She wove her hands in 
intricate patterns.  &quot;No one needs to know that you were Pretty Sammy.  
And now, by the power of Juraihelm, I, Queen Tsunami do hereby declare 
it so!&quot;

Ramia ended the spell and faced Tsunami.  &quot;There was a faction of 
Earthlings that opposed magic.  You feared for the magical girls&#39; 
safety, so you asked me erase the memories of those who knew that Pixy 
Misa was Misao.   You in turn, would erase those who knew Sasami was 
Pretty Sammy.  I did so, but only on Earth.  But you overdid it!  Your 
spell caused all of Earth, including Sasami, as well as Juraihelm, to 
forget Pretty Sasami.  By sheer luck, the effect on Misao was minor, 
because Pixy Misa&#39;s ego was not concious at the time.  

As a side effect of your spell, Earth lost its champion of justice.  
The Balance didn&#39;t react then, since Earth was in no danger.  But this 
last crisis threatened Juraihelm and Earth, so the Balance judged your 
act.

I realized that it was you when we broke the binding magic on Sasami.  
The three of us began to remember what you made us forget.&quot;  Ramia 
victoriously pointed her finger at Tsunami.  &quot;Therefore, it was you 
who caused the Imbalance.&quot;  Ramia smiled in triumph.  &quot;If the 
magistrates hear about this, they will certainly dethrone you.  But 
only if they hear about it.&quot;

Tsunami&#39;s eyes narrowed.  &quot;It appears that you have something in 
mind.&quot;

&quot;Ah, you&#39;re catching on.  Yes, I do.  An alliance.  Between your house 
and mine.&quot;

&quot;Very well.&quot;

Tsunami&#39;s calm response caught Ramia off guard.  She quickly composed 
herself.  &quot;Excellent.  I will send instructions for a meeting with me 
and Rumiya.&quot;

&quot;Rumiya will not be needed.&quot;

&quot;What?  So you&#39;re not serious about an alliance?&quot;

&quot;I am, but it will not involve Rumiya.&quot;

&quot;Idiot!  Rumiya is my only kin!&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;m not an idiot, Ramia.  Otherwise, you wouldn&#39;t make me this 
offer.&quot;  Tsnuami&#39;s voice had lost its cheery lilt, and bore a weight 
of seriousness which Ramia rarely heard.  &quot;Let me make it clear - if 
the Seven could not control me, then you don&#39;t have a chance either.&quot;  

&quot;So they knew too?  I had a feeling they did.  And they still chose 
you, even though you said that you would simply plant flowers.  
Furthermore, in all those times you were such an airhead, it was 
because you closed your mind with a memory lock spell, so that your 
actions would not hint towards a certain outcome.&quot;  Ramia paused.  &quot;I 
thought it was merely a glamour spell, but you hid the spell within a 
spell.&quot;  In an instant, Ramia remembered several possible occassions 
of Tsunami&#39;s duplicity, and her face grew red from anger and 
frustration.  &quot;All that wasted time, when I had to clean up after you!  
You didn&#39;t tell me anything!  All that work wouldn&#39;t have mattered!&quot;  

&quot;What&#39;s done is done, and the future remains true.  What you did, 
Ramia, happened because you willed it to, and thus it came to be.  It 
is small consolation for your troubles, and I apologize.  But if you 
think about it, everything has turned out well, and in no small thanks 
to your efforts.&quot;

&quot;Is that why you asked me to be Chief Magistrate?&quot;

Tsunami pouted.  &quot;I&#39;m disappointed, Ramia.  But perhaps, I was too 
subtle.  Very well, I will tell you this - given what I knew then and 
what I know now, I still had to make a choice, because I believe that 
the future is what we decide it to be.   It was my choice to offer you 
that position, and the future had nothing to do with it.&quot;  Tsunami 
watched Ramia&#39;s changing reactions.  &quot;I am glad that you accepted, for 
you performed beyond my expectations.  You didn&#39;t have to work so 
hard, because I didn&#39;t expect you to prove anything to me.  I prefer 
to think that you merely wanted to prove yourself worthy.  You were 
more than worthy, Ramia.  Misty Mountain proved that.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t believe you.  Before I left, you said &#39;May the stars guide 
you.&#39;  You said that knowing that was the key to solving the riddle of 
the Hall of Lights.  You said it because... because you thought that I 
couldn&#39;t do it.&quot;  Ramia shook with anger.

&quot;But you were the one who solved it and escaped with the Scroll.  The 
barriers and traps of Misty Mountain are not to be taken lightly.  And 
what&#39;s more, you realized that the Seven would want the Spell of 
Reversal - the only spell that can break my memory lock.   Despite 
this, you returned the Scroll and restored Misty Mountain&#39;s defenses.&quot;  
Ramia seemed to shiver slightly, but Tsunami could not discern whether 
it was from anger or fear.  (I don&#39;t want any more secrets, so I might 
as well push you.)  Tsunami took a step toward Ramia.  &quot;Anyway, we 
digress.&quot;  

Tsunami&#39;s eyes bored through Ramia&#39;s.  &quot;I&#39;m not letting you hide 
anymore, Ramia.  I want you to decide, without hiding behind the 
pretext about preserving my bloodline, or advancing your political 
status, or preventing me from keeping my throne.  I want you to think 
hard about it, and decide for yourself.&quot;  Tsunami took her arm and led 
her to the door. 

Ramia panicked.  &quot;Why don&#39;t you just tell me what I&#39;m supposed to 
do?!&quot;

Tsunami smiled gently.  &quot;Because it&#39;s your future, Ramia.  I am ready 
to face the consequences of my actions, as well as yours.&quot;  Then her 
smile widened into a wicked grin.  &quot;Besides, it&#39;s much more 
interesting if you choose your path yourself, than for me to tell 
which path you would choose.  Now go out there and think about it!&quot;  
Somehow, Tsunami pushed her out the door and slammed it shut.  

Ramia bit the tip of her thumb in frustration.  Tsunami had torn down 
all her fronts for the alliance, and she couldn&#39;t think of any more 
excuses to hide behind.  She felt naked and vulnerable as she 
remembered how Tsunami locked her eyes in a soul gaze.  (Damn, you 
Tsunami!  I&#39;m not ready for this!)  Her mind clouded with thoughts of 
whether Tsunami knew of her plots and sub plots, and even worse, all 
the other things that she didn&#39;t have the courage to do.  (Don&#39;t play 
mind games...  Clear the mind...  Must... Must get away from it 
all...)  She walked unsteadily down the hall way.

Tsunami&#39;s door clicked open, and Tsunami stuck her head out, and 
called out in her usual cheerful voice..  &quot;By the way, don&#39;t forget to 
get Misao and Sasami presents next month, so don&#39;t go very far.  And, 
it has nothing to do with birthdays.  More like a lifetime event.&quot;  
The door closed again.

&quot;Hmph.&quot;  Ramia had enough of nonsense, and wandered out into the 
courtyard.  Then a thought occurred to her, and her eyes widened 
incredulously.  &quot;It... it can&#39;t be that they&#39;re going to...&quot;  (Damn 
it, Tsunami!  Don&#39;t think that this little twist will influence my 
decision!)  Ramia looked up into the sky.  (Right?)
