&quot;Have her, luscious, wondrous, wronged, now know.&quot; Seifer mumbled to 
himself, as he lay sprawled atop his bed. In his hand he held the faded, 
and torn picture of Fujin. The photo was taken years ago during a trip 
to Balamb Village&#39;s beach. She was sitting under one of the piers out of 
the sun, eyeing a seagull that had wandered over to investigate her. 
With a sigh he set the photo aside and lost himself in though while 
watching the ceiling fan spin lazily overhead. After his defeat in the 
Lunatic Pandora he&#39;d been dismissed from Ultimecia&#39;s favor. He still 
truly believed in his dream of becoming a Sorceress Knight, but now, he 
knew he was horribly mistake in having sided with Edea. The woman had 
been tainted by Ultimecia&#39;s darkness and for a time that realization had 
drove him mad. Confused and lost to all reason he tried to offer Rinoa 
to Adel. Fujin and Raijin, the two knew he was in a downward spiral from 
the beginning but stuck with him.

&quot;What I did to them, to everyone.&quot; He thought bitterly. During the time 
after Ultimecia&#39;s defeat, he had time to think about his actions and it 
shamed him. He wandered for a time, with Fujin and Raijin following 
loyally. Then he made a choice. He traveled back to Balamb, he knew 
redemption was far away for him. But his companions, they could still be 
happy, happier without him. Squall tried to welcome him back too, but he 
knew it was only a token display and so under the cover of night and 
without a word he left.

Lost and without a future he knew he needed to face his inner demons. 
The introspective unlocked something, something forgotten; something 
left behind at the back of his mind, something from Ultimecia. At that 
moment he formulated a plan to right the wrongs committed. That plan led 
him to the islands of heaven and hell. The trials he faced there were 
hellish and he welcomed them, it seared away the pain in his heart and 
forged his resolve into steel.

Then, one night, under the stars he found the picture, lying haplessly 
at the bottom of one of his packs. Her face called to him like a siren&#39;s 
song. He studied the photo thoughtfully. In all the years she&#39;d traveled 
with him he never noticed how beautiful she was. He&#39;d been horrible to 
her, harsh words and harsher actions. He dismissed those thoughts, and 
focused more on the feelings that now welled up in him. His months of 
solitude gave him time to think and he soon realized that he loved her. 
Problem now was, in his present state he dared not approach her. He 
noticed her avoiding him, how her gaze would dart away from his. Perhaps 
she had feelings for him also, he had always wondered if she could 
harbor those kind of emotions.

He&#39;d always thought her cold and aloof, even heartless but was confident 
that he could warm her, bring her out of her frozen shell.

***************

Her fist slammed into the punching bag with an unchecked fury. She 
followed up the assault with a storm of vicious kicks and strikes that 
seemed altogether unnecessary. The heavy thuds echoing loudly in the 
near empty gymnasium. Quistis had taken to joining Fujin in her early 
morning workouts.

&quot;Something troubling you?&quot; Quistis asked peeking cautiously from around 
the bag.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin huffed offering a wary smirk as she rubbed her wrist.

Quistis moved to her and took her hand in hers.

&quot;Now why don&#39;t I believe you.&quot; She sighed, tenderly massaging it. Fujin 
winced slightly and Quistis nodded. &quot;You&#39;ve gone and sprained it. Now I 
know something&#39;s troubling you.&quot;

&quot;FINE.&quot; Fujin assured her. &quot;Fine.&quot; Quistis said in unison. Fujin eyed 
her suspiciously.

&quot;I know you, I&#39;d had hoped you&#39;d realized that by now.&quot; Quistis smiled.

&quot;WORRISOME.&quot; Fujin grumbled with a sigh.

&quot;That&#39;s nice.&quot; Quistis pouted.

&quot;APOLOGY.&quot;

&quot;I take it you&#39;re not going to tell me.&quot;

Fujin grabbed a towel and sat down on a near bench, her shoulder 
slumping wearily.

&quot;No, I assume.&quot; Quistis murmured.

&quot;WILL BE OKAY.&quot;

&quot;Is it Seifer?&quot;

Fujin tongued her cheek in annoyance. She really didn&#39;t want to talk 
about him. She&#39;d all but buried him in her mind and his return brought 
back bitter memories.

&quot;Fu, I just want to help.&quot; Quistis said softly kneeling by her side.

Fujin nodded solemnly but remained silent. With a look of dismay Quistis 
stood. &quot;Alright then, I won&#39;t sit here and try to make you, but if you 
need me you know I&#39;m here for you.&quot; Feeling somewhat hurt, she let the 
matter drop and headed for the showers, leaving Fujin to her thoughts. 
Fujin mentally kicked herself. She didn&#39;t want Quistis fretting and 
worrying over her right now, not with all that was going on. Seifer&#39;s 
very presence made a mess of an already delicate situation, she knew he 
would expect her to follow along behind him like the loyal fool she had 
been.

She couldn&#39;t avoid him forever, at some point she&#39;d have to face him and 
it would most likely be an ugly affair. The prospect was troubling, more 
so for Quistis than herself a confrontation would upset her greatly and 
Fujin had no desire to see her upset. Quistis was a woman of deep, fiery 
emotions and Fujin knew that she&#39;d explode if she learned of the things 
Seifer had done to her. Fujin couldn&#39;t blame her for she knew she&#39;d do 
the same if roles were reversed. With a heavy sigh she stood and headed 
to the showers to join her companion.

***********************

&quot;Open the gate.&quot; Luccian said with a haunting smile. The guard stepped 
out of the guardhouse with a curious look. The morning sun had not yet 
cleared the mountains so he could barely see the youth standing in the 
predawn darkness.

&quot;Who goes there, it&#39;s a little early for visitors.&quot; The guard said 
clicking on his flashlight. Luccian&#39;s eyes glimmered in the light; the 
pupils of his eyes were dilated giving, him a soulless shark like gaze.

&quot;Luccian Czar, I&#39;m here to see my father.&quot; He said thickly.

&quot;Sure you are pal, no one sees the Mr. Czar without a invite.&quot; The guard 
huffed folding his large muscular arms.

&quot;Call him tell him I&#39;ve arrived. I know the way to the house, so you 
need not accompany me.&quot; Luccian said simply, walking towards the gate of 
the compound.

&quot;Hold it right there! I&#39;m not calling anyone; it&#39;s five in the morning. 
Come back during operating hours.&quot;

&quot;Destroy him.&quot; The thought came to Luccian&#39;s mind out of the blue. He 
looked at the guard with a wicked smile. The guard, who to his credit 
was no fool, kept a healthy distance and went for his gun cautiously.

&quot;Not gonna tell you again kid.&quot; He said firmly.

&quot;Kill him.&quot; Again the thought came, this time it was more like an inner 
voice. Luccian frowned and shook his head. Why would he kill the man, he 
was only doing his job, even if he was incompetent. He raised his hands 
in a non-threatening manner.

******

In his youth Artemis Czar had been a powerful and crafty man, ruthless 
in business and indulgent in play. Over the years his exuberant and 
boisterous lifestyle had caught up with him. He had few regrets though; 
he loved hard, to hard if the truth were told. His wife left him years 
ago and took half his estate with her. Even now, at his worst, he still 
had women fawning over him. A small army of buxom nurses served his 
every need.

The doctors said it was a mixture of alcohol and pricey cigars that ate 
away his insides. With a ruined liver, tortured lungs and something 
insidious growing in his bowels, they said his time was short. Even then 
he did not stop, he saw no reason to, he was dying already, why make 
things miserable. He only had one wish now, his one son, the heir to his 
empire. Luccian, the boy was a lazy lout, always wanting things the easy 
way, never having to struggle to get what he wanted.

Artemis knew he had faults, but he at least earned everything he got. He 
wanted his son to appreciate life and know what it was like to work for 
a living. It was several years ago that he encountered his old friend 
Cid Kramer and learned of the Garden and SEED programs.

In a stroke of inspiration he had Luccian join the academy. A proper 
military training regiment is just what his lackluster son needed. 
Perhaps then the boy would make him proud and learn to stand on his own. 
He lay now, in his bed, a humidifier bubbling quietly nearby. The sound 
of screaming caused him to stir and he sat up weakly, removing the 
oxygen that was attached to his face.

&quot;Candice!&quot; He wheezed. The night nurse bounded into the room cheerfully.

&quot;Yes sir!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the noise?&quot; He coughed.

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; She shrugged and walked to the window. &quot;Looks like 
something&#39;s going on by the plant one.&quot;

Artemis slid the out of bed and hobbled to her side.

&quot;What ever was going on seems to have settled down.&quot; She smiled. &quot;Come 
now you have to lay down you need you&#39;re rest.&quot; She said firmly, leading 
him back to the bed.

&quot;Join me?&quot; He grinned wolfishly.

&quot;Now is not the time sir.&quot; She grinned, prying his hand off her.

*****************

Quistis ate quietly, Fujin had said little to her since their little 
argument. Zell and Nicole set their trays down before the two and joined 
them for breakfast. Nicole was beaming brightly while Zell looked as 
though he&#39;d lost his best friend.

&quot;What wrong?&quot; Quistis inquired in a somewhat reserved tone.

&quot;They banged her up Miss Trepe.&quot; He whined as he grabbed the salt and 
started to sprinkle it on his eggs only to have the lid pop off, dumping 
the entire contents. &quot;This is just great I should&#39;ve stayed in bed.&quot; He 
groaned in dismay.

&quot;He stayed in that hanger all night.&quot; Nicole whispered to Quistis 
knowingly as the small dragon perched atop her shoulder yawned with 
disinterest. Fujin looked up suspiciously at the thing and pointed at it 
with her fork.

&quot;UNSANITARY.&quot; She said with typical bluntness.

&quot;She&#39;s clean, cleaner than you.&quot; Nicole said jokingly.

Fujin bristled slightly but took the ribbing in stride.

&quot;Cute little thing, any problems yet?&quot; Quistis asked eyeing the 
creature.

&quot;Nope not at all, I guess she&#39;s got good instincts.&quot; Nicole shrugged. 
&quot;Got a litter box last night and she went right in to do her business.&quot;

&quot;Now don&#39;t tell me that dragon uses a cat box?&quot; Irvine laughed as he and 
Selphie approached. &quot;Scoot down a step, ya punk.&quot; He chuckled to Zell, 
who groaned in annoyance before sliding over.

&quot;Hey guys.&quot; Selphie waved meekly as she sat down by Quistis. &quot;Sorry 
about yesterday, been feeling weird.&quot; She apologized before looking at 
Nicole. &quot;Are you sure you should bring that in the cafeteria?&quot; She asked 
as the critter leaped from Nicole and onto Zell&#39;s shoulder. Zell ignored 
it and went back to eating while it craned its neck to sniff curiously 
at Irvine.

&quot;Go away.&quot; Irvine snorted, poking at it cautiously with his finger. The 
little critter nipped and spat at him causing him to jump. &quot;HEY!?&quot;

Fujin nearly choked and chuckled at the sight.

&quot;Don&#146;t you start.&quot; Irvine scowled candidly at her.

&quot;Come here Ica.&quot; Nicole cooed cutely, calling the little dragon back to 
her.

&quot;Ica?&quot; Quistis blinked.

&quot;Yeah, I think it&#39;s a cute name.&quot; Nicole grinned.

&quot;I like it.&quot; Selphie smiled.

&quot;So Zell, how bad is the ship?&quot; Irvine asked behind a spoonful of 
oatmeal.

&quot;Oh boy.&quot; Nicole mumbled.

&quot;She&#39;s ruined man, bastards.&quot; Zell snarled.

&quot;Technicians say we&#39;ll have to scrap her.&quot; Quistis noted.

&quot;Over my dead body!&quot; Zell nearly shouted. &quot;I&#39;ll work my fingers to the 
bone to get her running again.&quot;

Selphie eyed him a moment and looked to Nicole wickedly.

&quot;Passionate devil isn&#39;t he.&quot;

&quot;About some things, yes.&quot; Nicole mumbled dryly.

&quot;Cut the boy some slack, a man forms a special bond with his machines.&quot; 
Irvine protested before giving Zell a brotherly clap on the back.

&quot;So do some girls.&quot; Selphie added with a lewd grin.

&quot;Selphie!&quot; Quistis balked

&quot;I wasn&#39;t implying anything, you&#39;re the one thinking dirty thoughts.&quot; 
Selphie huffed innocently.

&quot;Do I even want to know?&quot; Rinoa asked, giving everyone a bubbly look. 
Squall stood behind her looking vexed.

&quot;Pull up a seat you two we&#39;ll make room.&quot; Irvine waved them over.

&quot;Table looks a little crowded.&quot; Squall said dryly, having no desire to 
socialize.

&quot;Nonsense.&quot; Selphie beamed. &quot;Sit down you grouch.&quot;

Fujin moved closer to Quistis as Squall sat awkwardly beside her. Rinoa 
sat down next to Irvine.

&quot;ASSIST.&quot; Fujin blurted out of the blue.

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis looked at her in confusion, as did everyone. Fujin 
coughed and slumped slightly in her seat. &quot;ZELL.&quot;

&quot;Do what?&quot; Zell wondered, looking flabbergasted.

&quot;REPAIRS.&quot; Fujin clarified, then went back to eating.

&quot;Um okay.&quot; Zell shrugged. &quot;Thanks!&quot; He grinned broadly then looked 
around and saw everyone looking at him. &quot;What!?&quot; He shot defensively 
causing everyone to go back to eating.

&quot;Nicole?&quot; Rinoa asked softly.

&quot;Yah?&quot;

&quot;Why is you&#39;re pet?&quot; Rinoa started but was cut off.

&quot;Ica.&quot; Nicole said importantly.

&quot;Okay, why is Ica having breakfast with us?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t get her started.&quot; Selphie smiled.

&quot;Will you guys quit picking on my Ica.&quot; Nicole pouted, petting the 
dragon fondly.

&quot;Oh Hyne look.&quot; Rinoa said, quietly pointing to Seifer who was standing 
in line waiting to be served. The two security personnel who were 
assigned to him stood calmly by the door watching for potential trouble.

&quot;Squall, what&#39;s with the guards?&quot; Irvine asked seeing the duo.

&quot;Just in case.&quot; Squall said bluntly. Selphie sneered at the sight of him 
but remained silent.

&quot;I take it Edea helped him out?&quot; Nicole said thoughtfully.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, that&#146;s between them.&quot; Squall answered.

Fujin stood to leave causing Quistis to look up at her curiously.

&quot;Where are you going?&quot;

&quot;CLASS.&quot; Fujin said quietly.

&quot;A little early isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin answered grimly before dumping her tray and striding 
out of the cafeteria. Quistis sat in a stupor and frowned.

&quot;What was that about?&quot; Selphie asked.

&quot;I don&#39;t know for sure.&quot; Quistis mumbled softly but quickly put on a 
fake smile. &quot;She&#39;ll tell us eventually I guess.&quot;

*******************

&quot;Fix me!&quot; Seifer yelled.

&quot;Pardon?&quot; Edea said icily, insulted by his tone. Seifer tensed and his 
fists clenched tightly. He had hurried to her small office as soon as 
he&#39;d finished eating. Fujin had run off again, she was apparently 
playing girlish games with him and he knew it. The thought of not being 
able to speak his mind effectively to her was making him furious. Then 
there was the matter of Ultimecia to be resolved.

&quot;Fix me.&quot; Seifer said again, sounding calmer but hiding a growing fury.

&quot;It will take time.&quot; Edea said gently.

&quot;To understand such the importance of matter is paramount, least she and 
her both lost to me and all!&quot; Seifer exploded, jumping up from his seat 
he slammed his fist into Edea&#39;s desk causing her papers and pens to 
scatter.

&quot;Hush child.&quot; Edea said softly. Rising out of her seat she touched his 
forehead with her palm. He made a noise akin to a dying bull and 
collapsed back into his seat barely able to move. Edea moved from behind 
her desk and approached him. Her face was scornful, she did not 
appreciate his belligerent attitude.

&quot;Do not presume to intimidate me. I know what dangers you speak of and 
what desires you seek. Know this, I will help you to the best of my 
abilities. But to rush such a matter would be painful if not fatal. I 
suggest you wait, the effects will wear off in time. Until then I can 
hurry it along somewhat.&quot;

Seifer shook his head violently.

&quot;No?&quot; She arched a brow, surprised. &quot;You&#39;ve learned nothing of patience 
on your island.&quot; She sighed. &quot;A pity.&quot; With that she sat back down and 
Seifer could feel his strength returning.

&quot;To make apologies is enough to think, but to wait is not to be consider 
or options of had, I desire to and seek to this and more but post haste 
lest all to her and she is lost to me!&quot;

&quot;Apology accepted.&quot; Edea smiled eerily.

&quot;Fix me.&quot; Seifer said again.

&quot;Even after what I&#39;ve told you?&quot; Edea sighed sadly.

Seifer nodded firmly.

&quot;It may kill you.&quot; She assured him bluntly.

&quot;Now.&quot; Seifer said again almost pleadingly.

&quot;I will consider it.&quot; Edea frowned. &quot;Now go, let me think.&quot; She scowled, 
not happy with the prospect. Seifer nodded and did as he was told.

**************

Quistis went through her teaching regiment in an uninspired and 
straightforward manner. She was worried about Fujin, and the fact 
Luccian may have went rouge added even more stress to her. Thankful that 
the class was over she leaned back wearily in her chair. Fujin walked 
over to stand by her quietly.

&quot;GOING.&quot; She said softly.

&quot;Where?&quot; Quistis asked rubbing her strained eyes.

&quot;AEKA, TRAINING.&quot;

&quot;Have fun.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;UPSET?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;YES YOU ARE.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just worried about, ever since Seifer came back you&#39;ve been acting 
more and more distant.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;M SORRY.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t apologize, I know it&#39;s your way, you&#39;ll tell me when you&#39;re 
ready. Will I see you tonight?&quot;

&quot;IF YOU WANT.&quot;

&quot;Do you want to?&quot; Quistis asked sourly.

Hurt, Fujin didn&#39;t know how to respond.

&quot;BYE.&quot; She mumbled, grabbing her bags and leaving.

Quistis felt like screaming as she watched her go.

****************

Luccian sat in his father&#39;s room smiling warmly.

&quot;I just don&#39;t get it dad. I learn the business just like you asked. I 
could run this place blindfolded now. I go Balamb, as you wished and you 
still refused to admit you were wrong about me.&quot; He sighed and shook his 
head. &quot;I know how to work hard for what I want. Hell, look what I had to 
do just to get were I am now. This guardian is magnificent, sure it&#39;s 
unruly but that&#146;s just the way things are. If you knew the trouble it 
was to get this thing, but now that it&#39;s over, I see things looking up 
for the better. I just want you to know I&#39;ll take care of the business. 
I have big plans for the future, sure you don&#39;t approve now but you 
will, when all is said and done, you&#39;ll be proud of me.&quot;

He sniffed curiously and stood.

&quot;Man what a stink.&quot; He grumbled walking over to the window. Staring out, 
he saw that one of the fires he&#39;d started had reached the pile of 
corpses that had been the compound&#39;s security team. &quot;Ugh that&#146;s nasty.&quot; 
He shivered then looked back to his father. &quot;Sorry about all that by the 
way.&quot; He said stepping over the smoldering husk that had, until moments 
ago been a nurse. &quot;You know how people can get sometimes. Don&#39;t worry 
though the others will be whipped in line as soon as possible.&quot;

He winked. &quot;By the way pops ya never said what you think of the suit.&quot; 
He spun around grinning proudly. &quot;A little flashy yes, but hey I say if 
you got it flaunt it. To bad Archie isn&#39;t here, he was like you. You 
know, thinking I was a low life. Oh well, water under the bridge eh.&quot; He 
shrugged, stuffing his hands in his pockets. &quot;Well it&#39;s been wonderful 
seeing you again. I have to go clean things up, can&#39;t leave a mess like 
this lying around, it&#39;s downright unprofessional.&quot; He smiled fondly down 
at the steaming pile of gore that had been Artemis Czar. &quot;See ya later 
pops.&quot; He waved before striding out of the room whistling merrily.

***************

Seifer had just gotten out of the shower and was toweling off as he 
stepped into the living room. The guards at the door refused to let him 
wander unattended but considering his last place of residence the small 
apartment was a godsend. He headed towards the kitchen meaning to fetch 
something to eat when he spotted something out of the corner of his eye. 
Whipping around he saw Quistis sitting on the couch. Oblivious to his 
nakedness she glared at him with such a venomous look it nearly worried 
him.

&quot;Beautiful, all knowing schoolmarm, pleasure still to grace abode of 
such merry madness and misunderstood meaning.&quot; He said wrapping the 
towel around his waist and bowing.

&quot;Cut the crap.&quot; She said firmly, able to decipher the gist of his 
rambling.

&quot;Hostility, for what cause of such ill feelings, no one word nor act, 
nor intent have I even pondered on any but she who waits.&quot; He said 
looking hurt.

&quot;Don&#39;t give me that Seifer, you always hated me.&quot; She snapped.

&quot;Fair to be sure, enough then such of niceties what for did the 
instructor arrive at my cell but abode?&quot; He scowled, plopping down in 
the chair next to her.

&quot;Let&#39;s talk about Fujin.&quot; She smiled cynically.

&quot;Glorious, winter vixen my heart, soul, all leap with mind and body to 
once more speak name of she who is all.&quot; He said jumping up gleefully.

Quistis blinked in a cold stupor.

&quot;Since when?&quot; She finally stammered.

&quot;The past I know, weakness, boyish, afraid and suffering such of 
emotion, but know now, oh now the pump sings in chest for her soft lips 
and embrace. Correct errors and pain of long ago to just one word from 
mouth to speak and settle me....&quot; He started working into a full out 
rant and she had to stop him.

&quot;I get the picture.&quot; She said loudly. &quot;What did you say to her?&quot;

He sulked and hung his head.

&quot;Not one word spoken yet or look gave, avoidance, to misery of one who 
hold high she, to be left cold, but fret now not, shy too she was and is 
I surmise. I aim to gain praise and more once...&quot;

&quot;Enough I get it.&quot; She frowned.

&quot;Why does scholar, beauty and respected foe to ask one such thing and 
questions to me?&quot;

&quot;Not that you really care, but she&#39;s upset that you&#39;re here.&quot; She said 
softly.

&quot;Worry more not to this thing. No harm, foul or mischief in me to this 
she knows, only joy and love. But know the she that waits and sleeps 
with darkness and all things will know wrath unbound for pain cause.&quot;

He said with a glint in his eye that Quistis found unsettling. She had 
not idea what he meant nor did she wish to fathom it.

&quot;Nice talking with you.&quot; She said evenly and got up to leave. The 
conversation did little but leave her with even more questions. He 
shrugged a grinned broadly as she left. At least he now knew Fujin was 
thinking about him. </pre>
