Fujin skidded to a halt and huffed proudly, she turned and looked up the 
slope.

&quot;VICTORY.&quot; She said with a proud smile that quickly faded as Quistis 
slammed into her.

&quot;ACK!&quot; Quistis yelped wildly as they tumbled end over end into a heap of 
snow, ski&#39;s and limbs.

&quot;INSANE!?&quot; Fujin shrieked in confusion.

&quot;You stopped in front of me!&quot; Quistis grumbled as she disengaged 
herself.

&quot;BEAT HILL.&quot; Fujin said proudly as she brushed herself off.

&quot;Bout time.&quot; Quistis giggled as she struggled to her feet.

Fujin pushed her back over into the snow.

&quot;You heathen!&quot; Quistis barked.

Fujin smirked and offered her a hand. Quistis grudgingly took it then 
promptly pulled Fujin down with her. Fujin fell atop her causing their 
heads to knock together.

&quot;Ow Damn!&quot; Quistis winced; Fujin rubbed her head and gave her a dirty 
look. They looked at each other a moment then abruptly burst into 
laughter.

Fujin stopped laughing and sat up, straddling Quistis, who propped 
herself up on her elbows. She regarded her curiously.

&quot;What?&quot;

Fujin said nothing but her demeanor grew somber. The wind caught her 
hair and stirred it around her pale face, as she looked quietly looked 
about. Quistis tilted her head in though as she tried to read her.

&quot;STRANGE.&quot; Fujin said hauntingly, then looked back down at Quistis with 
a curious expression.

&quot;What is?&quot;

&quot;LONG TIME.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t understand hon.&quot;

&quot;SINCE LAUGH.&quot;

&quot;Surely not. Granted you&#39;re not the most jolly person, but I&#39;ve seen you 
laugh before, well sorta.&quot;

&quot;DIFFERENT.&quot;

&quot;How so.&quot;

&quot;COME.&quot; Fujin said, changing the subject as she hopped up and helped 
Quistis to her feet.

&quot;Huh? Where to?&quot; Quistis asked as she slipped her glasses off and 
cleaned them.

&quot;ZELL.&quot;

&quot;Eww is it that late already.&quot;

&quot;YES.&quot;

&quot;Damn.&quot; Quistis moved close to draped her arms around Fujin&#39;s hips. &quot;So 
little time.&quot; She sighed.

&quot;UNFORTUNATE.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Quistis breathed wistfully.

Fujin awkwardly stroked her hair soothingly.

&quot;OKAY?&quot;

&quot;Mmm Hmm, just want to hold you a moment.&quot; Quistis murmured as she 
rested her head on her shoulder, holding her tight.

Fujin closed her eye, as she suddenly felt overwhelmed with emotion. 
Without a word she returned the embrace as she looked out over the snow 
expanse. Off in the distance she could see people mulling about. They 
might as well have been on another planet.

&quot;Kay.&quot; Quistis sniffed and broke the hug with an awkward smile. &quot;Let&#146;s 
get our stuff an get out of here.&quot;

Fujin nodded and smiled faintly as they began to gather their scattered 
gear.

Zell set the Ragnarok down in the parking lot of the resort. The great 
craft hissed and groaned as its hydraulics adjusted themselves. He was 
early so he sat back in his chair, lost in though. He was still sore 
from where she kicked him. Dr. Kadowaki had fixed the various bruises 
but said he&#39;d probably walk funny till the soreness went away.

&quot;Lil runt.&quot; He grumbled and pulled out a small handheld video game. 
-Defenders of the Line- He&#39;d been driving himself crazy the last few 
days with it.

He sat in the cockpit passing away minutes, just having made it past the 
Marlasian Death fields when something hit the cockpit canopy. He looked 
up, seeing nothing he went back to fighting some sludge monster. 
Something else hit the cockpit, this time he saw it out of the corner of 
his eye.

&quot;What the heck?&quot; He paused the game and stood up. A fair sized rock 
rebounded off the cockpit window causing him to duck reflexively.

&quot;Oh man someone&#39;s gonna get beat down.&quot; He shouted as he rushed down the 
ladder to the lower level. Moments late the gangplank lowered and he 
charged out. Loud honking and the angry shouts of a mob greeted him.

&quot;Whoa.&quot; He paused and took a step back. There was a line of nearly ten 
cars and trucks lined up at the Ragnarok&#39;s landing gear. A far-sized 
horde of angry people stood about cursing and yelling. One man, a tall 
rotund fellow with a grizzly bear beard charged up to him.

&quot;GET THIS HEAP OUT OF THE WAY!&quot; He shouted angrily.

&quot;Hey easy big guy what&#39;s this about.&quot;

&quot;Your dagburned thing.&quot; The man gestured wildly at the ship. &quot;Whatever 
it is, is blocking the road outta here!&quot; A roar from crowd showed they 
just as angry as he was.

&quot;Dude calm down all you had to do was ask me to move it.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve been banging on the door for nearly twenty minutes!&quot;

&quot;Oh sorry man, wasn&#39;t listening.&quot;

&quot;MOVE IT!&quot;

&quot;Geeze.&quot; Zell shrank back and looked at the man as if he&#39;d gone mad.

&quot;Zell!&quot; Quistis called as she pushed her way through the crowd, Fujin 
followed behind her giving the crowd a wary look.

&quot;Oh hey Miss Trepe.&quot; Zell waved and pointed to her, then looked at the 
irate man &quot;Was just waiting on them, we&#39;ll be out of your path in just a 
few minutes.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; The man huffed sourly. Quistis joined them on the gangplank with 
Fujin choosing to keep a eye on the crowd.

&quot;PROBLEM.&quot; She shouted abruptly.

&quot;What&#39;s going on Zell?&quot; Quistis asked as a police cruiser blared it 
sirens and slowly crept through the crowd.

&quot;Oh hell.&quot; He sighed.

&quot;Ah good now we will get something done.&quot; The man said proudly.

&quot;Great.&quot; Quistis soured.

The sun was setting and it was getting colder by the minute and the mob 
was getting flustered and now that the police showed up things could 
take even longer.

Fujin turned suddenly and shoved the stranger off the gangplank as she 
made her way inside the ship.

&quot;What the fuck!?&quot; The man roared as he fell on his rear in the snow.

&quot;Fu!?&quot; Quistis moved after her.

&quot;What are you guys?&quot; Zell started.

&quot;Okay everybody hold it.&quot; A tall lanky officer said shrilly as he hopped 
out of his car.

&quot;They assaulted me!&quot; The man screamed in outrage.

&quot;Shaddup.&quot; The officer barked as he approached the scene warily. 
&quot;Dispatch we have a unknown craft up here at Snow Ridge, seems military. 
Please advise.&quot; He called into his comm.

&quot;Cid isn&#39;t going to like this.&quot; Zell whispered.

&quot;Zell.&quot; Quistis took his face in her hands and turned him towards her. 
&quot;What is going on.&quot; She said slowly.

&quot;Hey I was just minding my own business, when the yokels started 
throwing rocks at the ship.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

The crowd started honking and yelling again as the hotel management made 
their way to the disturbance.

&quot;What is going on out here the Resort manager yelled over the crowd?&quot;

The officer waved everyone back.

&quot;Yo Miss Trepe what&#39;s going on.&quot; Raijin yelled over the crowd and waving 
madly.

&quot;Hey that&#146;s Raijin!?&quot; Zell gawked.

&quot;I know.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;Hey! You two on the gangplank get down here.&quot; The officer ordered.

&quot;Miss Trepe what are we going to do!?&quot; Zell began to get agitated.

&quot;Shit.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;Miss Trepe?!&quot; Zell stared in shock at the profanity.

&quot;Ah hell,&quot; She rubbed her head. &quot;Zell, sorry.&quot; She looked at the 
policeman and then off in the distance. She could make out several 
lights coming over the mountains.

&quot;Oh oh.&quot; Zell moaned.

&quot;Okay I think we better just go talk to the policeman before the gets 
out of hand.&quot;

The Ragnaroks engines roared to life making everyone duck at the roar.

&quot;Holy!&quot; Zell shouted in surprise as the craft shook under his feet. The 
officer ran to his cruiser and started yelling into his radio.

&quot;Miss Trepe?&quot; Zell yelled.

The Ragnarok was an intimidating craft greatly resembling a great red 
dragon. Complete with a snarling red maw and metal rending claws, it was 
a terror to behold. So it was little surprise to the crowd when its 
mighty head pivoted down and roared loudly. Panic ensued as everyone 
scattered and ran for their lives.

&quot;FUJIN!?&quot; Quistis shouted in shock as she saw her in the cockpit 
grinning madly.

&quot;That&#146;s what we need right now.&quot; Zell grumbled.

The craft lurched and started to rise into the air causing him to 
stumble.

&quot;Hey she&#39;s not cleared to do that!&quot; He shouted.

&quot;Get inside!&quot; Quistis shouted as she grabbed Zell by the arm and raced 
up the gangplank.

She was only slightly aware of the officer yelling at them through the 
roar of the engines.

The gangplank slammed shut and hissed as the interior pressurized.

&quot;She&#39;s gonna get us arrested.&quot; Zell yelled.

&quot;Calm down.&quot; Quistis said sternly as she made her way to the cockpit.

Fujin scanned the control board of the Ragnarok as the craft hovered 
slowly.

&quot;BUILDING!&quot; Quistis screamed as she ran into the cockpit. Fujin&#39;s head 
snapped up with a start, inadvertently the Rangnarok had began drifting 
slowly upon lift off. The resort&#39;s upper levels where just a few dozen 
feet away.

&quot;HYNE&quot; Fujin shouted as she pulled the stick back. She nearly laughed 
aloud as the craft started to rise. She&#39;d caught a glimpse of an old man 
looking out his window right as the ships reptilian head scraped past. 
The look on his face she would remember for a long time. She ship was 
now drifting backwards while facing at an upward angle it&#39;s engines 
making a storm of snow and water billow about the front yard of the 
resort. The incline was too steep for Zell to even get in the cockpit 
and it was all Quistis could do to keep from falling against the back 
wall.

&quot;Fujin what in the world are you doing!&quot; She shouted.

Fujin hit the throttle and pushed the ship forward, it leveled then 
launched into the darkening sky with dazzling speed. Quistis could hear 
Zell cursing loudly somewhere in the back.

The Ragnarok jetted past several police hovercraft so fast the pilots 
where only barely aware of it, the wake of the ship causing the smaller 
craft to wobble wildly

Quistis finally fell into a seat and held her head. Zell came tearing 
onto the bridge with a vengeance.

&quot;You!&quot; He roared pointing at Fujin. She turned and looked at him thinly. 
&quot;Outta my seat!&quot;

Fujin looked to Quistis who nodded somberly then laid her seat back to 
rest. Fujin unbuckled herself and stood away. Zell took the seat but 
stopped to give Fujin a rather foul look first. Fujin ignored him and 
took a seat in the back, thinking it best to leave everyone alone for 
the moment.

Quistis looked over at her.

&quot;What where you thinking?&quot; She asked with a confused and tired grin.

&quot;EXODUS.&quot;

&quot;Exodus? What the heck is exodus?&quot; Zell shouted over his shoulder.

&quot;Zell please.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;Zell please.&quot; He mumbled mockingly but kept quiet, he was getting 
rather aggravated.

Fujin glared at him until Quistis got her attention again.

&quot;While I do commend you&#39;re efforts, try not to be so eager next time. 
You nearly gave me a heart attack.&quot;

&quot;You and me both.&quot; Zell scoffed.

UNDERSTOOD.&quot; Fujin said sternly.

Quistis rested quietly in her seat and smiled warmly at her, causing her 
features to soften a bit.

&quot;That was rather funny though.&quot; She said smilingly.

Fujin smirked faintly before she too settled back in her seat.

&quot;So how was the trip Miss Trepe? Miss trouble get in your hair?&quot;

&quot;SILENCE.&quot; Fujin snapped.

&quot;Wasn&#39;t talking to you, ya ghoul.&quot;

&quot;You two please behave.&quot;

&quot;HE&#39;S IDIOT.&quot; She snorted

&quot;SHE, INSANE.&quot; He said mocking her.

&quot;Children, children.&quot; Quistis said dully.

&quot;Sorry Miss Trepe.&quot; Zell said glumly.

&quot;We had fun Zell thank you for asking. What about you, did I miss 
anything?&quot;

&quot;Not really accept Selphie went berserk. She attacked Irvine&#39;s sister 
and me in the hall.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis sat up in surprise.

&quot;DESERVED IT.&quot; Fujin pointed out.

&quot;No one asked you!&quot; Zell said while giving her the finger.

&quot;SPIN.&quot; Fujin shot back, returning the gesture.

&quot;Irvine has a sister?&quot; Quistis balked.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m okay.&quot; Zell grumbled sourly at the lack of concern for his 
well being.

&quot;Sorry hon, are you okay?&quot;

&quot;Yes I&#39;m fine, she kicked me in the nads though the lil runt.&quot; He said 
darkly.

&quot;NO LOSS.&quot; Fujin chirped.

&quot;Listen you!&quot; Zell shouted and turned in his chair, shaking a fist at 
her.

&quot;Fujin, please hon, don&#39;t get him any madder.&quot; Quistis asked pleadingly.

Fujin nodded complacently and settled back in her seat. Zell glared at 
her hotly before turning back around.

&quot;Anyway, apparently she&#39;s a half sister, from his dads ex girlfriend. 
You probably seen her, she&#39;s from Galbania too like he is. Tall, pretty 
redhead senior student, you&#39;ll probably have her in your class this last 
semester coming up.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah I&#39;ve seen her. She&#39;s rather popular with the boys I hear.

&quot;That&#146;s her.&quot;

&quot;So why did Selphie attack you?&quot;

&quot;KINNEAS, FLIRT, MISUNDERSTANDING.&quot; Fujin said blandly.

&quot;That&#39;s pretty much it.&quot;

&quot;What, Selphie that he was sleeping around with her?

&quot;Yup.&quot;

&quot;Whew I can imagine how that turned out.&quot;

&quot;Celest lost some teeth and I&#39;ll be lucky to have kids.&quot; He joked 
grimly.

&quot;Are you serious?&quot;

&quot;Yeah she blew a complete gasket.&quot;

&quot;I need to talk to her.&quot;

&quot;Good luck.&quot;

&quot;Oh by the way, watch out for Rinnoa.&quot;

&quot;What on earth for?&quot;

&quot;She thinks little Miss gloom and doom back there is brainwashing you or 
some nonsense. That&#146;s what Nikki told me anyway.&quot;

&quot;Oh good grief.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;That&#39;s what I said, besides everyone knows she&#39;s not smart enough to do 
anything like that.&quot; He laughed gesturing to Fujin.

&quot;DIE.&quot; Fujin said simply.

&quot;Not today.&quot; Zell laughed.

&quot;Glad to see I&#39;m still popular.&quot; Quistis smirked.

&quot;You are to me teach.&quot; He gave her the thumbs up.

&quot;You&#39;re to kind. I&#39;m gonna catch a nap wake me up before we get home.&quot;

&quot;Will do.&quot;

Fujin sat quietly as Quistis doze off, after a moment she slipped down 
to the lower levels of the Ragnarok to get a blanket. Upon returning she 
carefully draped it over Quistis&#39;s sleeping form. Zell noticed this in 
the reflective glass and prepared a snide remark, but something in the 
way Fujin was acting made him stay silent. He waited for her to finish 
then got her attention.

&quot;Hey Fujin.&quot; He whispered loudly.

&quot;Shhhh.&quot; Fujin hissed as she moved up beside him.

&quot;We have some time, want me to show you how to fly this thing?&quot;

&quot;WHY.&quot; She looked at him warily.

&quot;I&#39;m bored, your company is better than none I guess.&quot; He shrugged.

&quot;TRICK?&quot;

&quot;Please, at the control of a spacecraft isn&#39;t the place to be clowning 
around.&quot;

&quot;TRUE.&quot;

&quot;Come on, better take advantage while I&#39;m in a good mood.&quot;

&quot;VERY WELL.&quot; Fujin nodded as she slipped into the co pilot seat and 
buckled herself in.

&quot;Okay now then, you seem to have some kind of training with aircraft so 
I assume you know the basics and can keep up straight, correct?&quot;

Fujin nodded, not wanting to talk loudly out of fear of waking Quistis.

&quot;Alright then I&#39;m switching control over to your side keep us level and 
I&#39;ll talk you through some of the flight systems. Oh and do be careful 
not to wake sleeping beauty back there or she&#39;ll have both our rears. 
Unlicensed persons are prohibited from getting at the controls. You&#39;ll 
be lucky if she doesn&#39;t go to Cid about you&#39;re little stunt back there.&quot;

Fujin shrugged, she did not expect any special treatment from Quistis in 
those regards. She knew enough that work was separate from their 
feelings, at least she hoped she did.</pre>
