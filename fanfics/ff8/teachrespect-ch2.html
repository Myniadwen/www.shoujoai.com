<h1>Teaching Respect (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff8/index.html">Final Fantasy  8</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cssinclair.html">C S Sinclair</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff8/teachrespect-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><div>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jumping in shock, she whipped her hand 
away, half rising from the table. Xu had leapt back with surprise also, 
and was looking at her with alarmed concern. She looked about, suddenly 
painfully aware that people were staring, and sat back down quickly. 
She could feel her face had reddened, and under the table, she was wringing 
her hands uncontrollably. Take control… take control.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;SORRY. SURPRISED.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu just kept looking at her, with that 
same worried look. This had been a terrible idea, all of this had been 
a terrible idea. Coming back here… why had she done this to herself? 
And now even Xu… but then why should she expect her to think any different 
after all she&#39;d done...?</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Fujin?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She looked up, back from her drifting 
reverie again. Xu was… smiling. And not a cruel smile, not the kind 
of smile that many were making in the cafeteria around them. It was 
a soft, warm, reassuring smile. Her hands smoothed on her lap, her heart 
slowed. She could breathe again.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;FINE. PLEASE CONTINUE&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Are you sure, we can leave it 
here if you’d prefer?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu had closed her notebook, and laid 
the pen on top. Fujin couldn’t help but wonder what she had written. 
Was she just taking down her thoughts, or did the notebook include personal 
observations of her strange behavior just then? Was that her future 
there?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu smiled warmly and took a sip from 
her glass, before asking in an off-hand manner:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Would you like to read what I’ve 
written?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Briefly stung, Fujin realized her train 
of thought must have been obvious. She shook her head, but it was hardly 
convincing. She picked up her glass, realized she was just nervously 
copying Xu, and put it back down again. She could feel her clothes pressing 
on her body, feel everyone looking. This had been an awful idea.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu placed her own glass down, and half 
reached with her hand, before letting it come to rest on the edge of 
her place mat.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It’s okay you know. You don’t 
have to be worried. These sessions are for your benefit. No-one is trying 
to trick you or judge you. I’m simply trying to understand how you 
feel, if you feel you’re settling in again?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;FINE&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She felt ridiculous saying it again, 
especially as it so obviously wasn’t true. But still, as awkward as 
this had become, she had to admit that these sessions did help a bit. 
She found she actually looked forward to them. Xu was always so understanding, 
and now she was Headmistress, she hardly needed to handle things like 
this herself. Sitting here with her was so relaxing, like old times, 
like the really old times… she just wished she hadn&#39;t agreed to do 
this one in public. It was too soon. She wanted to leave, but she didn&#39;t 
want to leave just yet. If only everyone else would leave and let them 
do this on their own...</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;FINE&quot; she repeated, with 
more confidence this time. She took a quick sip of water. Xu waited 
patiently, before gently prompting her:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Go on, just say what’s on your 
mind.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin eyes darted around the room. 
It was partly nerves, mostly nerves really, but also a defiant wish 
to catch someone definitely listening in, someone she could feel justified 
in… She blinked hard, trying to fight the anger and guilt down. Xu 
had caught her gaze, and with an incline of the head, brought Fujin’s 
gaze back to the table. Unable to stop fidgeting, she rested a hand 
back on the mat in front of her, though she couldn’t resist running 
her fingers across the glass standing there.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;BEING HERE. SHAME&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu smiled with encouragement, and leant 
slightly forward:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And?&quot; she breathed softly, 
&quot;What else? Come on, you’re doing great, don’t stop now.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin nodded and brought the glass 
up… empty. She put it down a little harder than she’d intended, 
before closing her eyes and… this was it. Just say it…</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;SC… SCARED… GUILTY.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There were murmurs from the cafeteria 
at large, but these were silenced at a look from Xu. She continued to 
stare until most of the people filed out, or retreated into the corners 
to finish their suppers. She had reached a hand onto Fujin’s arm gently 
as she looked away, first just two fingers, then another and another. 
Although finding it difficult to breathe suddenly, and wondering if 
the lighting in the cafeteria had something wrong with it, Fujin allowed 
herself to be restrained thus. At length, Xu turned back to her, beaming. 
There was such... pride in the smile. She could feel her mouth had dropped 
open in delight, and winced slightly as she hastily clacked it shut.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu’s hand still pressed softly at 
her arm: not a grip, but too tight to simply shake off if she tried 
to run. And moments ago, her instinct had still been to run from this 
room as fast as possible. Now though, she wasn’t sure. It had felt 
so good to finally tell someone, someone who wouldn’t laugh in triumph 
or recoil in disgust. She found herself smiling back, weakly at first 
but with growing confidence. She really had said it, out loud too. The 
world hadn’t ended.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I’m glad you’ve told me. 
It’s been kind of obvious you weren’t happy, and I want to help. 
You feel ashamed and scared to be back here, but you shouldn’t, okay? 
You have as much right to be here as anyone els… yes, you do!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Her grip tightened, into a firm, reassuring, 
but also slightly authoritarian squeeze as Fujin had begun to shake 
her head sadly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;PAST - WRONG… SHOULDN’T… 
AM DANGEROUS!&quot; she declared miserably.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu fixed her with a stern gaze: “That’s 
not true! The safety of my students is of the utmost importance to me. 
I would never place them in danger…”</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Saying this, Xu held up her palm, stopping 
Fujin from looking away in embarrassed disagreement at what she was 
about to say.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">“I’d never place them in danger 
and I’m not now – you’re not going to hurt anyone.” Fujin couldn’t 
believe how sincere she sounded; how completely she seemed to believe 
in her. She wanted to look away, ashamed because she didn’t deserve 
this sort of kind treatment, especially from Xu.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">“BUT… REPUTATION SAYS OTHERWISE. 
BALAMB DISCIPLANRY…” she stammered. She cringed inwardly at this 
decision to retreat to such a relatively safe subject, instead of tackling 
the real crimes she had committed… This was just typical of her – 
wilting in front of authority figures…</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu however glowed with affection: “Oh 
hush! I know you – you might give out a few knocks, but only to people 
you feel deserve it. And never anything much more severe than a clip 
on the ear anyway! Besides the disciplinary committee was Sei…”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She stopped in surprise as Fujin desperately 
grabbed her hand on the table. Looking down in panic, Fujin released 
it just as quickly however and shot her hands back under the table, 
clenching the nails into her knees. She looked up, trying to think of 
some apology. Xu shook her head comfortingly however, holding her hands 
open in gestures of calm, before pouring her another glass of water 
and offering it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin accepted gratefully, taking a 
deep gulp to steady her nerves: “SO SORRY… DIDN’T MEAN TO STARTLE…” 
she began.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu smiled encouragingly: “No, no; 
it was my fault. I didn’t mean to… I moved too fast there, I’m 
sorry. All I meant to say was that you are no threat to this school 
or its students, okay?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin almost choked on her water: “BUT… 
HOW CAN XU SAY THIS? LED SOLDIERS! ATTACKED GARDEN…” she argued, 
her voice initially indignant, but increasingly tinged with despair.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu was silent for a moment, then sat 
forward, knitting her fingers in front of her: “Well… since you 
bring it up, let’s talk about that. Can we… please?” she asked 
with great respect and patience.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin froze in panic – she’d been 
trapped! Xu had tricked her into… No, she couldn’t think that. She 
looked over at where Xu was sitting with a look of such concern and 
understanding - like she’d happily sit here forever, listening to 
her problems. She wanted, wanted so badly, to believe that Xu was trying 
to help her. And she wanted to tell her… tell her everything about 
herself, relevant or irrelevant. She was so tired of being scared and 
alone…</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">“AGREE… BUT FACTS ARE CLEAR - LED 
SOLIDERS AGAINST BALAMB… DISGRACE!” she murmured sadly, staring 
down at her glass.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu slid her palm gently across the 
table, motioning for Fujin to hold her head up. Complying, she saw Xu 
wearing a proud, determined expression.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">“If I may say so, the facts are not 
so clear cut as all that” she began. “It was a terrible situation 
of course – and it <i>was</i> wrong. You were wrong to attack us…” 
Fujin swallowed hard, determined to accept what was due to her. But 
hearing Xu say this… she felt so terrible.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu seemed to notice this however – 
she got up and moved to sit in the chair right next to her at the table 
and tenderly coaxed Fujin’s hands into hers. She couldn’t move – 
her mouth was open, there was murmuring from all around them… but 
she was helpless to do anything about any of it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Massaging her hands softly, Xu continued: 
“It was wrong, but you knew that, you and Raijin. You knew it and 
you both did what you could to make sure no-one got seriously hurt. 
That’s right, isn’t it?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin fought to find the words, any 
words… “Y… YES, BUT…” she choked, her mouth completely dry 
all of a sudden.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu shushed her quietly, took her glass 
and helped her take some of the water: “Your troops used non-lethal 
means to subdue people. Not only that, you gave aid to the injured of <i>
both</i> sides. The court made a point of it – without you two, the 
siege of Balamb would probably be named ‘The massacre at Balamb.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">“NO!” Fujin shouted, slamming her 
glass down and wrenching herself away from Xu. She sat facing half away 
from her, trembling with shame; her hands clasped tightly in front of 
her. Xu hung back respectfully, not rushing her… Xu silently cursed 
her, wincing with further shame as she did so. She didn’t deserve 
this kindness – why was Xu wasting her time with her like this?</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">“EXCUSES!” she managed finally, 
without looking at Xu. “EXCUSES MADE BY LAWYER – NOT ME!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She turned to face Xu, feeling somewhat 
calmer to be admitting this to someone whose opinion mattered: “WASN’T 
HEROIC, WASN’T NOBLE… LIES!” she confessed.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu’s hands twitched in front of her 
as she tried to reach for her but thought better of it: “Why are you 
denying it, ‘Fu?” (She’d called her… Fu? Why…?) “There were 
dozens of witnesses – I could fetch some of them right now!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin shook her head impatiently: “NO 
– MISUNDERSTAND. DOESN’T MATTER HOW MUCH HELPED - SHOULDN’T HAVE 
GONE ALONG WITH IN FIRST PLACE. WEAK… BLIND…” She felt a single 
tear roll down her cheek. “WANTED TO TELL THEM… BUT COULDN’T.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">“Because of Seifer right?” Xu whispered. 
“You didn’t want to make things look bad for him… because you 
trusted him when you followed him here. He made it sound like an adventure, 
but it wasn’t…”</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin nodded, biting back a sob of 
anger. She felt like such a sell-out; how could she have said that? 
She made to stand up and had almost cleared the table when she felt 
Xu’s hand at her wrist. Tugging feebly, she tried to escape, before 
allowing herself to be pulled back into her seat. Feeling Xu move to 
comfort her however, she resisted, pushing her away as politely as she 
could.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu looked crestfallen to see her so 
unhappy and to be rejected so from comforting her. She really did care 
– perhaps even… or was that too much to hope for? She thought back 
to when they’d been friends so long ago… could she really want someone 
like her? She longed to find out but… she couldn’t do it like this… 
to profit from talking so poorly of Seifer, after he’d looked after 
her and Raijin for so long…</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">“CANNOT BLAME… CAN’T DO IT! PLEASE 
DON’T MAKE…” she pleaded, leaning on the table, her face covered 
in her hands.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">After a short silence, she looked up 
to see Xu was sitting with her hands together at her mouth. She looked 
dreadfully upset. Fujin felt her insides churn sickeningly – she’d 
done this to her. Everyone who got near her, always had to pay so dearly. 
He had been right about her…</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">“I’m so sorry I upset you, Fu” 
Xu said, her voice strained with worry. “I just wanted you to try 
and accept you’re not dangerous. The court accepted it; I never needed 
convincing… it’s only you that needs to believe it now. Whatever 
else is involved – you belong here, not in some jail!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin leaned her forehead in her hands 
– Xu was trying so hard for her, but she was ignoring how hopeless 
it all was: “NOT EVERYONE SO FORGIVING - XU MUCH KINDER THAN MOST. 
SO GRATEFUL BUT…”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">“People are more forgiving than you 
think! Just give them a chance – we’ll make it work!” Xu interrupted, 
her hand questing across the table for hers.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin reached down, but pulled away 
before she made contact: “NO… IS HOPELESS! AM AWFUL TEACHER… HATE 
IT…”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu kept her hand out defiantly: “I 
know that isn’t true! It’s natural to be nervous, but the students 
respond to your authority – because they know it’s not ego. They 
know you can teach them things – the value of strength and of restraint 
with that strength. You have so much to give… we can do this!”</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Listening to this in silence, Fujin 
pondered what Xu was saying. She looked down at the offered hand… 
and finally reached down and took it. Xu’s fingers closed about her, 
warm and reassuring. She looked over at her and nodded.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">“XU, CORRECT ONCE MORE. DON’T HATE… 
BUT FINDING IT HARD” she explained. “SIT THERE EVERY DAY, FEEL CLASS 
WATCHING… TRY NOT TO IMAGINE WHAT THEY THINK, BUT CANNOT HELP… END 
UP MAKING THEM READ, WRITE – DON’T REALLY TEACH!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu squeezed her hand supportively. 
She returned this sweet gesture, but couldn’t meet her gaze as she 
went on: “KEEP IMAGJNING THEM THINKING… WHAT RIGHT HAS SHE TO TEACH? 
CRIMINAL, FREAK, CYCLOPS…”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">“Don’t say things like that! You 
belong here and they know that! We just need to give it time!” Xu 
protested crossly. She was right by her side again, clutching her hand 
feverishly in both of hers now.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">“Can’t you see - we all want you 
here!” Xu insisted. “<i>I</i> want you here…”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">After everything she had done, Xu was 
still here for her. And looking at her now, feeling her comforting, 
insistent strokes… everything she had wanted seemed to be coming true 
before her eyes. She really did care… but was this the care of a close 
friend, a concerned superior or maybe, just maybe, an expectant lover…? 
She was so useless at this kind of thing – she never knew. Could she 
risk making a move? What if Xu only felt sisterly… like family?</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i>Family.</i> No, not now! She closed 
her eyes, trying to shut it out. In her head, she could see that pallid 
milky eye, so loathsome, so intrinsically her. And the voice, coming 
to drown out Xu’s words; her very presence… She tried to fight it 
down, but it was too late... the screams… the shouts…</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;We can offer you stability, authority. 
There are so many people who will benefit from what you bring. You’re…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;NOTHING! EVIL! FILTHY!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She was out of the room before she 
knew what she was doing. She cannoned along the corridors blindly, throwing 
people out of the way, before crashing into a washroom. She just made 
it to one of the stalls, before retching violently. The pan filled with 
vomit mixed with blood where she had bit into her lip. Its murky depths 
repulsed her, but she couldn’t stop.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;NO GOOD… AM NO GOOD…&quot;she 
sobbed inconsolably.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She <i>was</i> no good, no good to 
anyone. No matter how you dressed it up, she had brought such pain and 
disgrace… How could she look Xu in the eye, look anyone in the eye? 
Everyone found her out eventually. They’d all hate her, and they’d 
have every right to do so. This filth, blood, sickness, it was inside 
her, she could never get it all out…</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Fujin?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A small knocking on the stall brought 
her to her senses. Wiping her mouth quickly with the back of her hand, 
she shot to her feet, and pulled the door open with a harsh yank. Xu 
stood before her: pale white and looking deathly afraid. Fujin&#39;s sudden 
appearance had startled her and she staggered back a step in surprise 
at this.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin took this opening and pushed 
forcefully past her. Xu reached out a hand, but Fujin slapped it away 
and kept moving. She saw in the mirror that Xu was moving to follow 
her. She looked desperately for help in her reflection, but only a wretched 
coward returned her gaze.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;What is it? What are you looking 
at?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She’d come up and put a hand on her 
shoulder, with the other resting lightly against her back. She was looking 
worriedly from the mirror to her face. Fujin stiffened and turned away, 
fighting back the urge to throw her off and curl into a ball. Everyone 
was looking, everyone would see her.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Reaching up to her face, her hands 
were taken by Xu, warm and soft. She touched a finger to her lips: &#39;&quot;You&#39;re 
bleeding!&quot; and pressed her palm against her forehead, taking her 
temperature.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Oh Fu, you’re burning up and 
you&#39;re shaking, look! You’re not well, and you&#39;re hurt. Come on; we’ll 
go and see Dr…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;DON’T CALL ME…&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She wrenched her hands free, and fought 
herself free from Xu’s attempts to stop her.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Don’t… call you what? Fu? 
But… Raijin calls you Fu all the time. I thought…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;IDIOT! He…he’s an idiot. 
I’m… NO!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She pushed her away again, but much 
more violently this time. Xu flew back, hitting her side against a basin. 
Holding her side, she looked up at Fujin, but even now, she looked more 
concerned than scared.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin opened her mouth, desperately 
trying to find some kind of apology, looking down in horror at her hands. 
She’d felt it again - a surge of adrenaline and that low howling that 
spoke of the tempestuous power lying just under the skin. She shook 
her head in terror, as the memories came back.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Please, it… it’s alright! 
Please don’t be scared – I’m fine; just talk to me! You… you 
just need to calm down. I’m here, here for you, you understand?! I 
want to help you. Let me help you, please!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin sobbed with exasperated sadness. 
Why couldn’t she see, when it was so obvious?</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;FILTHY!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She pointed at the stall, and then 
pounded her chest with a balled fist. Xu shook her head vigorously, 
tears streaming down her face. But Fujin nodded, holding up her hands 
for Xu to see. Blood from her lip had dripped in spots onto them, and 
had been smeared in an ugly streak across them.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;SEE? THIS WHAT I AM!” she shouted 
with despair. “NOBODY IS SAFE – WILL ALWAYS END UP HURTING!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;That’s not true! That’s a 
terrible thing to say about yourself!” Xu sobbed angrily. “Can’t 
you tell me what’s wrong – is it me? Did I say something that upset 
you? Did I do something? If I did, I&#39;m sorry – I never meant to…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Her sentence was cut off as she winced 
in pain, stumbling back against the basins. Fujin caught herself as 
she instinctively made to lunge to her rescue. Xu was obviously hurt 
– she was having to hold onto the basins and wall for support. Even 
so however, she was still trying to move to her, reach out to her. Fujin 
shook her head and backed away. She’d done it again, hurt innocent 
people – she’d hurt Xu! She couldn’t stand it… he <i>was</i> 
right about her…</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Please, you mustn’t get so 
upset! You’re not well, not thinking straight!” Xu pleaded. “You’re <i>
not</i> evil, you&#39;re not fil…&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;DISGUSTING! AM… AM DISGUSTING... 
DON’T DESERVE XU’S SYMPATHY!&quot; she cried, her voice distorted 
with so much sorrow and guilt, it was barely more than a croak.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">And with that, she ripped open the 
door and fled, not stopping until she was safely in her room. Shaking 
with horror and shame, she curled up on the bed and pulled the covers 
over her.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Filthy… evil…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It had been a mistake to come here. 
She didn’t belong with good people, never would again. She’d been 
a fool for letting Xu convince her otherwise. Xu was so trusting, so 
good – she didn’t know. She had to get out of here. She’d resign 
first thing in the morning, just get away. She gripped her pillow tightly 
to her chest, tearing her fingers into it, clamping her eyes shut as 
she thought of how she’d hurt Xu. In despair, she sat up and looked 
at the mirror.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Help me… help me please.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Outside the door, two figures exchanged 
concerned glances, before agreeing nothing could be done that night, 
but keep guard. Raijin sank into a squat near the door, head in his 
hands, shaking silently. Xu stood inches from the door, listening for 
any sounds, before leaning her head against the wood.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Help me…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She could hear the pitiful sobs, and 
felt her heart breaking all over again.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I want to ‘Jin, I want to…&quot; 
she whispered softly.</font></p>
