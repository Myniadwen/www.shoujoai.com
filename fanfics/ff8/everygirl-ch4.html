<h1>Everybody Else's Girl (part 4 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff8/index.html">Final Fantasy  8</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/pphelan.html">Patrick Phelan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff8/everygirl-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>A SeeD, Xu reminded herself, is calm and unruffled in any circumstances. 
She is near-impossible to faze. Everything she sees, she sees with an 
objectivity that approaches disdain. She certainly does not grow so used 
to her Faculty Assistant&#39;s quarters that she feels cramped and 
uncomfortable in the standard SeeD dorm...

&quot;I&#39;m sorry about this,&quot; Quistis said, shifting a chair in the gap 
between her tiny bed and the wall. There was really nothing else she 
could shift - her dorm was meticulously clean, even sparse. Xu had never 
even seen a book lying around, though she knew Quistis read voraciously 
and had borrowed over half of the Garden library over the course of her 
study. (She was always very punctual with late fees.) &quot;I wish I could 
offer you tea, but the communal kitchen&#39;s being used and I don&#39;t think 
the kettle&#39;s been washed...&quot;

&quot;It isn&#39;t a problem,&quot; Xu said, smiling. &quot;Besides, you&#39;ll be moving into 
a bigger place when you get your Instructor&#39;s licence, right?&quot;

Quistis stopped moving for a moment, looking at the floor. &quot;I&#39;d rather 
not get my hopes up,&quot; she said.

How very Quistis of you. I don&#39;t know if that makes me happy because of 
how you it is or if it makes me worry because you&#39;re selling yourself 
short...

Quistis decided to neglect the chair she&#39;d so carefully moved, and sat 
down on the side of her bed. Xu, not quite knowing what to say (of 
course you&#39;ve passed the test, of course you&#39;ll get that room, of course 
you&#39;ll get your licence, you&#39;re Quistis Trepe),sat beside Quistis, and 
Quistis surprised her by leaning over and resting her head on Xu&#39;s 
shoulder.

&quot;I can&#39;t stand not knowing,&quot; Quistis murmured, sounding almost too tired 
to say anything else. &quot;Every minute I think about another question I 
probably missed. I wish they&#39;d just come around and tell me I&#39;ve 
failed.&quot;

&quot;They won&#39;t,&quot; Xu said. As a trained SeeD negotiator, she could have lied 
instantly, brilliantly, utterly believably. And yet, she couldn&#39;t 
imagine lying then. It would have been... inexcusable.

And somehow, she found her arm around Quistis&#39; shoulders, and Quistis 
resting her entire side against Xu. Even silent, it was strangely 
comfortable. Xu took a moment to wonder why she hadn&#39;t held Quistis 
before this... and then, almost selfishly, to wonder how long she could 
keep the moment going, how long she could keep Quistis all to herself, 
how long she could remain warm and comfortable in a cramped SeeD 
dormitory.

She didn&#39;t count the minutes, but when a knock came at the door, she 
thought that there hadn&#39;t been enough of them. Quistis extricated 
herself from Xu&#39;s arm, and walked to answer her door.

The visitor was a SeeD, somewhere between Quistis&#39; and Xu&#39;s age, in full 
uniform and carrying an envelope. &quot;SeeD Rank 12 Quistis Trepe?&quot; he 
asked.

&quot;I am,&quot; Quistis said, nodding.

The SeeD was well-trained - he only allowed his eyes to flick to the 
girl sitting on Quistis&#39; bed once before presenting the envelope. &quot;This 
is from the Faculty.&quot; He stepped back, and saluted. &quot;Congratulations.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Quistis said, looking up. As the SeeD walked away, she 
closed the door behind him.

&quot;Congratulations?&quot; she asked, turning to Xu, and trying not to let any 
excitement show on her face.

Xu, unsurprised, stood to stand beside Quistis as she opened the 
envelope, pulling out the three sheets of thick paper within.

The writing on the first was short and to-the-point, as all Garden 
communications were: SeeD Rank 12 Quistis Trepe - This letter is sent to 
inform you that you have passed the Instructor Qualification Test with a 
score of 96%. Enclosed is your licence and replacement ID card. You must 
destroy your old ID card at your earliest convenience. With 
congratulations - Garden Faculty.

As promised, there was a card affixed to the paper, with the unsmiling 
photo of Quistis that she publically hated and Xu privately thought was 
beautiful, and printed besides it: Quistis Trepe, Rank 12, Instructor.

&quot;Which are the other two papers?&quot; Xu asked, and Quistis flipped the 
paper over with almost a hint of giddiness in her manner. From the very 
respectable SeeD Rank 12 Trepe - Instructor Trepe - giddiness was 
something entirely strange.

&quot;One&#39;s from Headmaster Cid,&quot; she said, looking over it. &quot;A personal 
letter of congratulations. It says I came highly recommended, that I&#39;ll 
be the youngest Instructor in the recent past, and that he&#39;s looking 
forward to seeing how the job suits me.&quot; She looked to Xu, smiling as if 
she should be laughing. &quot;Is he complimenting me or saying he&#39;ll be 
testing me?&quot;

&quot;Cid is complimenting you,&quot; Xu said, with an answering smile. This was 
Quistis&#39; victory, of course it was, but Xu felt as proud as if it were 
hers. &quot;NORG is testing you. And you&#39;ve already shown that you&#39;re more 
than up to the task.&quot;

Quistis did laugh at that, and then turned to the last piece of paper - 
gorgeously embossed, with calligraphic writing over it. &quot;My licence,&quot; 
she said, looking at it almost reverently.

&quot;You should have it framed,&quot; Xu said. Have it framed and put it on the 
wall above your bed, where anyone who enters this room can see it, and 
recognise that this is Quistis Trepe&#39;s room. You deserve to be able to 
show off for this.

&quot;I will,&quot; Quistis said, nodding. She walked, very proper, over to the 
bed, and set down her precious papers, before turning back and asking, 
&quot;Xu?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Would you mind if... may I...&quot; She paused, trying to think of a way to 
better word what she was trying to say, and then visibly made a 
decision. She walked, still as careful and decorous as ever, across the 
tiny room, coming very close to Xu - Xu would almost have called it 
uncomfortably close, if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that it was quite 
comfortable indeed. And hesitantly, Quistis raised her arms, and put 
them gently around Xu.

The hug started polite and formal, the sort of hug exchanged on the 
street between acquaintances... and then, as if on a preordained signal, 
Quistis&#39; arms pulled tighter, and she leaned against Xu with a sigh, and 
comfortably close was the perfect word for it.</pre>
