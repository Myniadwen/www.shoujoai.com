Fujin walked stiffly up the hall, oddly she was not so much angry as 
hurt.

&quot;They&#146;ll never accept me. There is too much bad blood between us.&quot;

She frowned sadly as the realization dawned upon her.

&quot;Fujin!&quot; Quistis called to her as she chased her out into the hall.

Fujin ignored her and sped up.

&quot;Fujin wait!&quot; Quistis called again, Fujin kept walking.

&quot;Damn it Fujin!&quot; She ran up and caught Fujin by the arm. She then spun 
her around to face her.

&quot;ALONE.&quot; Fujin snapped.

&quot;I&#146;ll do no such thing.&quot; Quistis said sharply.

&quot;WHAT THEN?&quot;

&quot;I just want to talk to you, to apologize.&quot;

&quot;NO NEED.&quot;

&quot;Yes I do, please understand I didn&#146;t expect Selphie to act that way.&quot;

&quot;PROMISED.&quot;

&quot;I know I did hon.&quot; Quistis hung her head ashamed. &quot;Forgive me, forgive 
her. She&#146;s still hurting about all the friends she lost in Trabia. 
You&#146;re the only one she can vent on.&quot;

&quot;UNDERSTANDABLE.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t give up on them, or me, please.&quot; Quistis took her hands in hers 
and smiled hopefully. Fujin shifted awkwardly then sighed.

&quot;NEVER FIT IN.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;ll take time Fu, I&#146;m willing to help you if you let me.&quot;

&quot;TROUBLE FOR YOU.&quot; Fujin said, her voice somber and regretful.

&quot;Let me worry about that.&quot;

Fujin sighed and rubbed her eye with her palm. Quistis knew she was 
getting uncomfortable.

&quot;You want to come with me?&quot; Quistis asked with a smile.

&quot;EXPLAIN.&quot; Fujin looked at her in confusion.

&quot;I&#146;m on vacation, you&#146;re not in class, let&#146;s go somewhere, just you and 
me.&quot;

&quot;WHY.&quot;

&quot;We both have been terribly tense lately. I think it&#146;s fine time we 
relax.&quot;

&quot;WHY ME?&quot; Fujin looked wary.

&quot;Why not, besides..&quot; She paused and looked at her thoughtfully.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin asked worriedly.

&quot;Nothing.&quot; Quistis smiled a gentle smile. &quot;Well are you up to it?&quot;

Fujin stood a moment. She almost said no, she was still reeling mentally 
from the thoughts and dreams she&#146;d been having lately. She was not sure 
what would happen if she said yes. Quistis saw her hesitate and nodded 
sheepishly.

&quot;It&#146;s okay, you don&#146;t have to go. I um.&quot; She stammered and suddenly felt 
like and idiot. &quot;I&#146;ll just head back to my room and pack.&quot; She took a 
few steps backwards and smiled awkwardly. &quot;I&#146;ll see you? Maybe, I 
guess..&quot; She shut up and sighed then smiled.

&quot;See you.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;LL GO.&quot; Fujin said nervously as she offered a shy grin.

&quot;It&#146;s okay I under...what? Really, you&#146;ll go?&quot; Quistis smiled and 
exhaled in relief.

&quot;I thought you.... never mind.&quot;

Fujin gave her a worried look.

&quot;I&#146;m okay.&quot; Quistis assured her. &quot;So do you know anyplace that&#146;s 
peaceful and nice.&quot;

Fujin blinked and was at a loss.

&quot;Okay then. Hmmm&quot; Quistis pondered as she turned and walked up the hall. 
&quot;Come on we&#146;ll go to the library, check through some travel magazines.&quot;

Fujin followed her quietly.

****************************

&quot;Why is she back.&quot; Luccian grumbled as leapt high into the air. A mass 
of green tendrils chased him, the thorny vines wrapping around his legs. 
He swung his sword; a long slender blade made cobalt blue steel. The 
blade sliced neatly through the vines and he landed safely several feet 
away, a cloud of dry leaves billowing up around him. The creature he was 
fighting gurgled in pain as it withdrew its tendrils back inside it&#146;s 
bulbous plant like body.

&quot;Beats me man, you shoulda seen your face though.&quot; Archibald said as he 
tackled the creature to the ground and pummeled it with his fists. The 
top of the creature&#146;s body split open like a rose and a foul smelling 
green gas billowed out. Archibald&#146;s eyes watered and he fell back 
coughing.

&quot;I&#146;m very upset by this.&quot; Luccian sighed in annoyance as he ran forward 
and pinned the creature to the ground with his sword. The thing thrashed 
about madly spewing thick brackish liquid everywhere.

&quot;Nasty.&quot; Archibald said sourly as he stood up.

&quot;What should I do?&quot; Luccian asked while he stepped away from the thing 
flailing about on the ground.

&quot;I dunno kill her?&quot; Archibald smirked.

Luccian looked at him and smiled.

&quot;That was a joke man.&quot; Archibald said warily.

&quot;Of course.&quot; Luccian stuck out his hand and pointed at the creature. 
&quot;Demios.&quot; He muttered causing a black orb to form around the dying 
beast. The thing frothed and whined pitifully as it&#146;s body buckled and 
crushed inward on itself. Archibald winced in disgust as it&#146;s insides 
burst and ruptured until it vanished into a dark pinpoint of light.

&quot;That was a little much doncha think.&quot; Archibald said with a belch.

&quot;Your disgusting.&quot; Luccian gave him a foul look as he pulled his sword 
from the ground.

&quot;See you got the hand of magic?&quot;

&quot;I see you haven&#146;t, you need to learn how to better attune yourself with 
your Guardians, as meager as they are.&quot; He sighed.

&quot;They seem to do everyone else okay.&quot;

&quot;That because they are content to settle for little.&quot;

&quot;Oh boy here we go.&quot;

&quot;Silence.&quot;

&quot;So what are we going to do.&quot;

&quot;About?&quot;

&quot;Your buddy.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m content to ignore her for the moment.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s a surprise.&quot;

&quot;We do not need to rock the boat right now, so to speak.&quot;

&quot;Yeah I bet that&#146;s the reason.&quot; Archibald mumbled with a smirk.

&quot;What was that?&quot; Luccian looked at him gravely.

&quot;Nothin.&quot;

A loud roar echoed through the training area.

&quot;T Rexsaur?&quot; Archibald asked cautiously.

&quot;Most likely come on let&#146;s get out of here.&quot; Luccian said looking about 
for signs of the monster&#146;s approach.

************************************

Quistis sat at a table at the back of the library thumbing through 
various travel magazines. Fujin sitting across from her was sorting 
through more.

&quot;QUESTION?&quot; Fujin asked.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Quistis looked up at her.

&quot;TYPE?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;LOOKING FOR?&quot;

&quot;Snow resort, perhaps?&quot;

&quot;COLD IS GOOD.&quot;

&quot;Find one you like then.&quot; Quistis smirked.

Fujin smiled and thumbed through the magazines. She was actually getting 
rather excited about the idea. She&#146;d never been on a real vacation 
before.

&quot;Oh thank goodness there you guys are.&quot; Nicole called out as she rushed 
over to them. Fujin stood up abruptly and watched her with hawk like 
intent. Nicole stopped and took a step back.

&quot;Fujin, I&#146;m sorry about what happened.&quot;

Fujin said nothing and just glared sharply.

&quot;That was sweet of you Nikki.&quot; Quistis smiled.

&quot;What Selphie did...it was tacky and mean. Please don&#146;t think we all 
feel the same way&quot; Nicole pleaded.

Quistis took Fujin&#146;s hand and gently pulled her back into her seat.

&quot;She&#146;s sorry Fu, Nicole&#146;s sweet you don&#146;t have to worry about her.&quot; She 
said softly

Fujin regarded her a moment longer before looked back at Nicole.

&quot;ACCEPTED.&quot; She said simply and resumed looking through the magazines.

&quot;Whew.&quot; Nicole said with a smile. &quot;What are you guys looking for? 
Perhaps I can help, I do work here you know.&quot; She pulled up a seat and 
sat down.

&quot;Well I&#146;m looking for a good snow resort. Know any off the top of your 
head?&quot;

&quot;Ooh wow you&#146;re going on vacation eh.&quot; Nicole clapped her hands in 
excitement.

&quot;Going to find some Resort hunk huh.&quot; She giggled.

Fujin suddenly felt uneasy.

&quot;Oh you know me better than that.&quot; Quistis smirked.

&quot;I know, just teasing. Resorts huh, let me go look around a bit.&quot; Nicole 
left her seat to fish around in one of the magazine racks.

Fujin sighed deeply.

&quot;You okay, you look worried?&quot; Quistis whispered to her worriedly.

Fujin nodded and bit her thumbnail absently.

Quistis gripped her hand comfortably.

&quot;It&#146;ll be okay, we&#146;re gonna have fun.&quot;

Fujin nodded and grinned nervously.

&quot;That&#146;s what I wanted to see. Your so tense sometimes, I worry about 
you.&quot; Quistis said with a smiled then resumed looking through the 
magazines.

&quot;What&#146;s happening to me?&quot; Fujin thought faintly.

She was awash with emotions, powerful emotions. She was feeling things 
about Quistis recently that attracted and frightened her at the same 
time.

&quot;Here we go, how about this place.&quot; Nicole said dropping a magazine on 
the table.

&quot;Snow Ridge huh.&quot; Quistis said as she picked up the magazine.

&quot;Looks nice but the price is steep.&quot; Quistis commented as she handed the 
magazine to Fujin. Fujin glanced through it idly.

&quot;Yeah but it&#146;s worth it, I&#146;ve went there with my parents before I came 
to Balamb.&quot; Nicole said knowingly.

&quot;Hmm I&#146;ll think about it, thanks.&quot; Quistis said.

&quot;No problem, I&#146;ll see you guys around. I have to get going. Fujin, don&#146;t 
worry about Selphie she&#146;ll come around.&quot;

&quot;Bye Nicole thanks again.&quot; Quistis grinned.

After she left she turned to face Fujin.

&quot;Well what do you think?&quot;

&quot;NICE.&quot; Fujin mumbled.

&quot;I think so to, I&#146;ll contact them and make reservations.&quot;

&quot;CAN&#146;T&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;EXPENSIVE.&quot; Fujin said grimly.

&quot;Oh please, It&#146;s my treat.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Fujin let me do this for you.&quot;

Fujin&#146;s jaw set firmly.

&quot;Don&#146;t be difficult.&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;PAYBACK.&quot;

&quot;Nonsense.&quot;

&quot;STUBBORN.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re the one who&#146;s complaining about a free vacation.&quot;

Fujin gave in with a sigh.

&quot;Ah good, I&#146;ll go make the reservations after that I&#146;ll see if we can&#146;t 
find someone to fly us out there on the Ragnarok.&quot;

Quistis stood and smiled down at her.

&quot;I&#146;ll see you later?&quot;

Fujin nodded.

&quot;Good.&quot; Quistis winked and hurried off.

Fujin watched her leave then sighed. She hoped she was making the right 
choice, she had no idea what to do next. She allowed a soft smile to 
come to her lips as she gathered the magazines up.</pre>
