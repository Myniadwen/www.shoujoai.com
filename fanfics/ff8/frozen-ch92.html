Fujin made a noise, something akin to a grunt of surprise and or 
disgust.

&quot;Oh hell would you look at that.&quot; Selphie winced, looking down at their 
wet feet. Quistis gaped in shock while Irvine did his part by fainting 
away like a swooning maiden.

&quot;Squall!&quot; Rinoa blurted watching Selphie look down in dismay at her 
dress.

&quot;Ah hell why now?&quot; She winced staggering towards the nearest chair. 
Snapped out of her surprise, Fujin moved to help her. In that instant 
the entire cockpit erupted into chaos. Rinoa babbled frantically while 
running in tight circles, looking for something, anything, that could 
help. Squall rushed forward just as Fujin reclined Selphie&#39;s chair. Upon 
taking in the site he, turned ghostly pale and quietly went back to his 
seat.

&quot;What the heck?&quot; Zell frowned, looking over at him.

&quot;Um, I think Selphie&#39;s having her baby.&quot; Squall mumbled quietly.

&quot;Oh that&#146;s cool.&quot; Zell nodded calmly then jumped in shock, controls in 
hand. &quot;What!&quot; The Ragnarok heaved sending Fujin toppling onto Selphie 
and Rinoa to the floor.

&quot;What the hell are you doing up there!&quot; Selphie screamed then focused 
her attention to Fujin who was more than a little bewildered. &quot;Get off 
me you lummox!&quot;

&quot;This isn&#39;t happening.&quot; Quistis gaped wide-eyed then shouted towards 
Zell.

&quot;Zell, get Kadowaki on the line!&quot;

&quot;What do we do, what do we do, what do we do!&quot; Rinoa screeched in a 
panic.

&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; Fujin and Selphie yelled in unison. Rinoa looked hurt but 
silenced all save for a small whine.

&quot;Oh no, no, no! You can&#39;t have that thing in here! I just redid the 
upholstery.&quot; Zell complained, looking over his shoulder feverishly.

&quot;Zell! Just call Kadowaki, Fujin, see how far along she is.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Selphie and Fujin balked. Fujin moved to Quistis side and looked 
down worriedly.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; She asked again through clenched teeth.

&quot;Fu, calm down, just look and see. I&#39;ll talk you through it&quot;

&quot;Since when are you a doctor!?&quot; Selphie shouted.

&quot;Look, I studied biology as a primary in advanced studies.&quot; Quistis 
explained calmly.

&quot;DO THEN!&quot; Fujin blurted fretfully.

&quot;I can barely move, just go do it.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;No way, I don&#39;t want her fishing around!&quot; Selphie shouted then howled 
as a wave of pain washed over her.&quot;

Squall turned green at the noise and Zell looked as if he was going to 
faint. Irvine meanwhile lay flat on his back and oblivious to all.

&quot;Fujin.&quot; Quistis said calmly. &quot;We don&#39;t have time for this.&quot;

Fujin looked at her pleadingly then took a deep breath before turning 
back to Selphie who swatted vehemently as she approached.

&quot;No, no, no, shoo, you go away!&quot;

&quot;SILENCE.&quot; Fujin grumbled pausing to gather her composure and wits. Then 
with a wince, promptly hiked Selphie&#39;s legs into the air.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Selphie screamed in a mix of anger and embarrassment. Fujin made 
a strained face then looked at Quistis.

&quot;WHAT NOW?&quot; Fujin groaned, trying not to think about it.

&quot;Okay, first you&#39;re going to have to see how far along she is.&quot; Quistis 
began to explain as Fujin nodded grave understanding.

Zell meanwhile just happened to glance back in time to see Fujin begin 
the investigation. &quot;Whoa!&quot; He squawked then spun back around so fast 
Squall feared he would break his neck.

&quot;Rinoa get this lunatic off me!&quot; Selphie shouted in dismay.

&quot;Um Fujin do you know what you&#39;re doing.&quot; Rinoa asked quietly, peeking 
over her shoulder. Fujin gave her an incredulous look.

Unable to handle the stress of the situation, Squall heaved slightly 
then scrambled out of his seat. All but running, he blew past Fujin and 
Selphie and tripped over Irvine before half falling down the ladder to 
the lower level.

&quot;Squall!?&quot; Rinoa called out to no avail.

&quot;Zell? Kadowaki?&quot; Quistis shouted.

&quot;She&#39;s not in her office, they&#39;re paging her now!&quot; He answered. &quot;Oh man, 
oh man, oh man!&quot;

Selphie howled anew and Rinoa rushed to her side.

&quot;You&#39;ll be okay!&quot; She babbled. Selphie grabbed her by the throat. 
&quot;Where&#39;s Irvine, I&#39;m going to kill him!&quot; She growled.

&quot;Can&#39;t breathe.&quot; Rinoa squeaked, prying her hands free. &quot;He uh...&quot; She 
frowned, amid gasps.

&quot;FAINTED.&quot; Fujin answered then looked to Quistis.

&quot;Oh ho! That dirty sombitch!&quot; Selphie screeched.

&quot;Well?&quot; Quistis asked worriedly.

&quot;NO IDEA.&quot; Fujin offered feebly.

&quot;He did this to me!&quot; Selphie screamed.

&quot;Calm down.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;I&#39;ll kill him!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say that, you love him.&quot; Rinoa frowned.

&quot;I hate him, I hate him, I hate him!&quot;

&quot;Zell, how long till we reach Balamb?&quot; Quistis called out, growing 
nervous.

&quot;About thirty minutes.&quot;

&quot;Ugh...&quot; Quistis frowned then looked to Fujin questioningly. &quot;Think 
she&#39;ll make it until then.&quot;

&quot;UH.&quot; Fujin mumbled. Then peeked under Selphie&#39;s gown again. Raising 
back up she shook her head grimly. &quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Negative! What the hell do you mean negative!&quot; Selphie shrieked.

&quot;Great.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;Come on, do your breathing.&quot; Rinoa said in a panic, mimicking the 
Lamaze breathing she&#39;d seen on television.

&quot;What the hell do you think I&#39;m doing you idiot!&quot; Selphie screeched 
flailing her arms in wild, pain induced frustration.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to be insulting.&quot; Rinoa pouted.

&quot;Insulting, insulting!&quot; Selphie hissed through grit teeth. &quot;My husband 
passed out, I have a lunatic peeking at my privates, there&#39;s a psycho 
flying the ship and I&#39;m in the worst pain of my entire life. I think I&#39;m 
entitled to my goddamned opinions!&quot;

&quot;Selphie, it&#39;s imperative to relax!&quot; Quistis pleaded.

&quot;Don&#39;t you tell me to relax your not the one having your baby in a plane 
full of retards!&quot; Selphie screamed vehemently.

&quot;Zell, how long would it take to get back to Deling?&quot; Quistis asked 
worriedly.

&quot;Same as Balamb, thirty minutes either way.&quot;

Selphie screamed anew as did Zell who needed to vent his frustrations.

*****************

Kadowaki waited in the hanger with a medical team. Nicole, Ellone and 
Celest where there as well, as was Angelo who waited eagerly for his 
mistress. The dog was the first to sense the Ragnarok&#39;s approach and 
barked briskly.

&quot;Here they come.&quot; Kadowaki noted, motioning for the medical team to 
stand ready. Landing lights broke through the evening sky as the 
Ragnarok came into view.

&quot;I hope she&#39;s okay.&quot; Nicole frowned.

&quot;I&#39;m sure she is.&quot; Ellone smiled.

With a roar the Ragnarok entered the hanger, venting steam as it settled 
heavily. Moments later the gangplank hissed then lowered. Kadowaki 
motioned her team forward with a gurney then paused as Squall staggered 
out looking green.

&quot;Are you okay!?&quot; Kadowaki frowned, looking him over.

&quot;Fine...&quot; He grumbled, staggering past.

&quot;Where&#39;s Selphie is she okay?&quot;

&quot;Fine, both of them.&quot; He noted in a slight daze.

Kadowaki nodded in understanding and motioned her team up the ramp.

On the bridge, Selphie was asleep, exhausted from her efforts. Irvine 
was awake, having come around in time witness the birth of his daughter, 
joyous tears well in his eyes he cradled Selphie to his chest. Quistis 
held the baby to give them a moment, wrapping it up in Squall&#39;s coat, 
which he&#39;d graciously donated.

Rinoa beamed brightly as Quistis gently rocked the child to sleep. Fujin 
meanwhile, sat up front with Zell who was still in shock by the whole 
ordeal.

&quot;Oh man, that was intense...&quot; He mumbled, looking at her with a stunned 
expression.

&quot;INDEED.&quot; Fujin mouthed absently, watching quietly as Quistis handed the 
baby to Rinoa who in turn passed it her father.

&quot;She needs a name.&quot; Rinoa smiled as Irvine cradled the sleeping infant 
awkwardly.

&quot;Wow...&quot; Irvine said with a so huge, that only new parents could manage 
it.

&quot;Wow&#39;s not a good name.&quot; Quistis chuckled.

&quot;Edea...&quot; Selphie murmured, opening her eyes sleepily.

&quot;Edea?&quot; Quistis smiled

&quot;It seems right...&quot; Selphie explained with a cute yawn.

&quot;Edea it is then.&quot; Irvine smiled softly, brushing a hand through her 
sweat soaked hair.

&quot;Thats so beautiful.&quot; Zell whispered to Fujin with tears in his eyes. 
&quot;Give me a hug.&quot;

&quot;SHUT UP.&quot; She hissed, punching him in the arm.

Kadowaki and her team arrived on the elevator and quickly survey the 
scene.

&quot;It&#39;s a girl!&quot; Rinoa beamed excitedly.

&quot;Gracious, is everyone okay?&quot; She asked, noting everyone&#39;s disheveled 
look.

&quot;We&#39;re fine Doc.&quot; Irvine said quietly.

&quot;Thank goodness, come on lets get you guys out of here.&quot; Kadowaki 
smiled, nodding to her assistance. Carefully they lifted Selphie onto 
the gurney and tucked her under an insolated blanket.

&quot;Here, I&#39;ll take her.&quot; Kadowaki said nodding to the baby.

&quot;I got her, just lead the way.&quot; Irvine said protectively.

As they exited the ship Celest and Nicole met them excitedly and 
followed them towards the clinic. Rinoa was next to exit and after a 
merry reunion with Angelo, they both set out in search of Squall, 
finally finding him sitting on a nearby crate.

&quot;You okay?&quot; She asked worriedly.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; He said quietly, looking up at her with weary eyes.

&quot;It&#39;s a girl.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s great.&quot; He smirked, glad that everyone was safe.

&quot;You ready to go home?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Me too.&quot; She smiled, entwining her arm with his.

Fujin carefully rolled Quistis&#39; wheelchair down the gangplank and looked 
around curiously.

&quot;GONE?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re probably all heading towards the clinic.&quot;

&quot;GOING TO?&quot;

&quot;Nah, let them be alone for awhile.&quot; Quistis smiled looking up at her 
lovingly. &quot;You did good.&quot;

&quot;SELPHIE DID IT.&quot;

&quot;Yeah but you helped, that was awfully brave of you.&quot;

&quot;HAD TO BE DONE.&quot;

&quot;I guess, still though, good work.&quot;

&quot;THANKS.&quot;

&quot;So, what now?&quot;

&quot;BATH...&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a good idea. Onward, mush!&quot; Quistis giggled, pointing 
ahead.

&quot;BAH!&quot; Fujin scoffed as they headed towards the exit.

By the time Zell exited the ship, the hanger was totally abandoned.

&quot;Hey, where&#39;d everyone go?&quot; He called out before someone shut off the 
lights.

&quot;Hey!&quot; He shouted in annoyance. &quot;Jeeze, someone&#39;s still in here!&quot; He 
grumbled then looked around in dismay. &quot;I need a mop...&quot; </pre>
