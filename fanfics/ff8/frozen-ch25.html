A kiss, to many it would be considered a simple gesture. Fujin however 
had never known such an intimate gift. She returned the kiss with a 
passion she never thought herself capable of as the world she knew began 
to crumble and in its place arose something new and overwhelming. She 
broke the kiss with much regret and looked at Quistis with a worried and 
shy look.

&quot;Wow.&quot; Quistis whispered in mild shock. &quot;This was unexpected.&quot;

Fujin&#146;s heart sank and she hung her head feeling utterly foolish.

&quot;No, no, no...&quot; Quistis assured her quickly as she ran gentle fingers 
through her hair.

&quot;It&#146;s okay...to be honest I was kind of hoping...&quot; She sighed and shook 
her head with a radiant smile.

&quot;What I&#146;m saying is.&quot; She looked up and made a face, this was harder 
than she thought it&#146;d be. She took a breath and decided to just come out 
with it.

&quot;I feel the same too.&quot; She whispered, her voice quivering. &quot;I have for 
some time.&quot; She blushed slightly.

&quot;Ever since that night on the balcony you&#146;ve been in my mind.&quot;

Fujin looked up slowly, her expression serene as tears sparkled down her 
cheeks.

Her heart soared as she threw her arms around her hugging her tightly. 
Quistis welcomed the embrace and rocked her soothingly while running her 
fingers through her hair.

Together they gazed quietly into the fire watching the flames dance in 
the darkness. In those silent moments nothing else mattered but each 
other. The warmth they shared melting away any regrets of the past or 
fears for the future.

&quot;You okay hon.&quot; Quistis whispered softly into Fujin&#146;s hair.

Fujin gazed up brightly into her eyes, not trusting herself to speak. 
She smiled a warm smile Quistis found infectious.

&quot;You should smile more.&quot; Quistis said with a grin and trailing a 
fingertip teasingly along Fujin&#146;s lips. Fujin snapped playfully at the 
finger and sighed before resting her head against Quistis&#146;s chest.

&quot;You planned this didn&#146;t you?&quot; Quistis asked thoughtfully.

Another quiet nod was Fujin&#146;s answer.

&quot;You still planning to sleep on the couch.&quot;

Fujin nodded yet again.

&quot;Oh you!&quot; Quistis gave her a light shove.

Fujin chuckled softly and stood. She stretched her arms wide she 
exhaled. She felt a lot better now that everything was somewhat out in 
the open.

&quot;What now.&quot; Quistis asked.

&quot;UNKNOW.&quot; Fujin said with an apologetic shrug.

&quot;Regrets?&quot;

&quot;NO.&quot;

Quistis smiled and stood to hug her; Fujin sneezed in her face.

&quot;ACK?&quot; Quistis looked at her flabbergasted. &quot;That&#146;s nice.&quot; She said 
sourly as she wiped her face.

&quot;APOLOGIES.&quot; Fujin blushed profusely.

&quot;You feeling okay? You where feeling sick on the way up here. I hope 
your not getting a cold?&quot;

&quot;FINE.&quot;

&quot;Yes you are.&quot; Quistis said flirtatiously, but it was lost on Fujin 
entirely who just looked at her uncomprehendingly.

&quot;Never mind.&quot; Quistis said feeling a bit silly.

Fujin sat on the bed and sniffed lightly, things would be different now. 
She&#146;d made her choices and now she was in new territory. She hoped she 
was doing the right thing, she cared for Quistis and didn&#146;t want to hurt 
her.

&quot;QUISTIS.&quot; She said softly as Quistis crawled into bed and slipped under 
the covers.

&quot;Hmm?&quot;

&quot;WHAT HAPPENS?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;WHEN RETURN.&quot;

&quot;To Balamb?&quot;

Fujin nodded.

&quot;What do you want to happen hon?&quot; Quistis propped herself up on her 
elbow to listen.

&quot;NOT ALONE AGAIN.&quot;

&quot;Then don&#146;t be, I&#146;ll always be there for you.&quot;

&quot;PROMISE?&quot; She looked at her seriously, her gaze searching, hoping.

&quot;I promise.&quot;

Fujin looked away and rubbed her eye with her palm, unnerved by the 
intensity of it all. Quistis just smiled and settle back among the 
pillows giving her time.

&quot;I..&quot; Fujin mumbled and sighed.

She looked up and frowned. After so many years of keeping her heart 
frozen, expressing her emotions was a painful process. She looked at 
Quistis with trembling lips as she tried to speak.

Quistis sat up and took her hand, squeezing it reassuringly as she 
smiled into her eyes.

&quot;I love you too.&quot; She said without hesitation then kissed her lightly on 
the cheek.

Fujin blinked in surprise then blushed cutely. Quistis giggled as she 
lay back down pulling Fujin with her.

&quot;YOUR FRIENDS?&quot; Fujin asked with a hint of worry as she slipped under 
the blankets.

&quot;What about them?&quot;

&quot;HATE ME.&quot;

&quot;They&#146;ll have to get over it.&quot;

&quot;BE HARD.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot;

&quot;CID?&quot;

Quistis giggled.

&quot;SERIOUS.&quot; Fujin looked at her darkly.

&quot;I know, I&#146;m sorry it&#146;s just so clich&eacute;, teacher falling for a student.&quot;

&quot;REGRETS?&quot; It was Fujin&#146;s turn to ask.

&quot;Never.&quot; Quistis scoffed at the idea.

&quot;CLASSES?&quot; Fujin yawned.

&quot;Nothing changes, besides it&#146;s not Cid&#146;s or anyone else&#146;s business. By 
the way don&#146;t think I&#146;m going to go easy on you just because of this.&quot;

&quot;BETTER NOT.&quot;

Fujin hitched violently several times as she held in a series of 
sneezes.

&quot;Don&#146;t do that, you&#146;ll blow you ears out.&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;APHOLOGY.&quot; She said rubbing her nose.

&quot;What!?&quot; Quistis laughed.

&quot;SNOT SNUNNY.&quot; She sniffed

&quot;Oh I think it is.&quot;

Fujin elbowed her and rolled over facing away from her.

&quot;You brat.&quot; Quistis teased.

&quot;GOON SNIGHT.&quot; Fujin replied in prideful indignation.

&quot;Night Fu.&quot; Quistis said warmly as she leaned over to kiss her on the 
cheek. She then snuggled close against her back and wrapped her arms her 
comfortably. Fujin smiled to herself and found her hand, holding it 
close to her heart as she began to drift off to sleep.

************************

&quot;Think she&#146;ll be back, I heard she was fired?&quot; Royce asked sadly as he 
thumbed through his books. Several Treppies moaned in dismay at the 
notion.

&quot;Who cares?&quot; Luccian moaned from his seat.

&quot;Kiss off.&quot; Royce growled.

&quot;You two shut up.&quot; Rinoa snapped causing everyone to stare.

&quot;I mean it, everyone is sick of it.&quot;

&quot;Sorry Rinoa.&quot; Royce sunk in his seat.

&quot;Pah.&quot; Luccian grumbled.

&quot;Quistis is just on vacation she&#146;ll be back in a few days.&quot; She said 
snappily.

&quot;Someone&#146;s in a bad mood.&quot; Archibald whispered to Luccian from his seat.

&quot;All the women here are pissy.&quot; Luccian scowled dryly.

Aeka tried her best to ignore them as she tried feverishly to catch up 
her homework before class started. Edea sat at Quistis&#146;s desk grading 
tests and listening to the chatter with mild interest. The final bell 
rang loudly and the chattering slowed to a stop. Edea looked up and set 
the papers aside. She stared out over the class with an icy calm. Aeka 
squirmed nervously under the scrutiny, she sorely wished Miss Trepe 
would return soon.

&quot;Class.&quot; Edea said monotonously.

&quot;Today we are going to the training area to see how you are progressing 
with your assigned Guardian Forces. I do remind you however that the 
Guardian Forces do cause memory loss over extended periods, therefore 
after the test they will be turned over to the staff for keeping until 
needed again.&quot; Several students grumbled in annoyance, Archibald among 
them.

&quot;The time you&#146;ve spent with them over the last week is to get you used 
to using them if ever the need arises. I&#146;ll meet you there promptly in 
thirty minutes do not be late.

The class gathered around the entrance of the training area talking 
excitedly as Edea approached. Zell, Selphie and Irvine followed behind 
her are causing more excited murmuring. Edea looked at the class and 
nodded approvingly at their preparedness.

&quot;Class Mr. Dincht and Kinneas as well at Miss. Tilmitt and myself will 
be assisting you in this test. One of us will be accompanying each of 
you in case things get out of hand. Now then let us begin, Zell you will 
be taking Gregory, Nei, Chris, and Aeka. Selphie you take Luccian, 
Royce, Nikita and Reese. Irvine you&#146;ll be in charge of Archibald, Mu, 
Tsueng, and Reda. Chet, Rinoa, Khan and Marianna you four will be with 
me. Now this is a team test each student pair up and meet with your 
assigned instructor for further information.&quot; Everyone was excited as 
they paired off into teams and waited to be tested.

It had been over and hour since Zell left with his first group and Aeka 
was nervous as all get out. Her partner and fellow Treppie Nei tried to 
calm her as best she could. Sadly Nei was tall, lean and athletic and 
headstrong, traits that made Aeka doubt herself more.

Finally Zell strode into the waiting area from the training hall. 
Gregory a large dark skinned man who spoke little but worked hard 
followed him proudly but bruised. Chris a lanky redheaded youth with a 
perchance for practical jokes was covered in mud, blood and bruises. He 
held his left arm, which hung, limp to his side and his eyes where 
bloodshot and glazed. Zell and Gregory helped him to a seat while one of 
the medical students tended his wounds. Zell made sure they both where 
cared for before turning to face Aeka and Nei.

&quot;Ladies, your up.&quot; He said brightly.

&quot;Yes!&quot; Nei hissed excitedly and grabbed Aeka by the shoulders and 
steering her towards what Aeka was sure was certain death.

*********************

Quistis awoke feeling somewhat disoriented until she felt Fujin curled 
up against her. The first thing Quistis was aware of was how drenched in 
sweat the girl was. She reached out and found her warm to the touch.

&quot;Fu.&quot; She whispered softly.

Fujin opened her eye dully and made a hoarse noise that Quistis assumed 
was speech.

&quot;Your sick.&quot; Quistis said flatly.

&quot;SNOT.&quot; Fujin argued.

&quot;No kidding.&quot;

Fujin rolled her eye and tried to sit up. Quistis pressed her back down 
gently.

&quot;You&#146;re not going anywhere Miss.&quot;

&quot;SNE SNINE&quot; Fujin coughed.

&quot;Yeah whatever. Just lay back and let me take care of you.&quot;

&quot;NBEGANIVE&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t argue with me.&quot;

Fujin groaned in annoyance.

&quot;Your going to be a fun patient I see.&quot; Quistis laughed as she stood and 
went into the restroom. &quot;Don&#146;t you dare get up.&quot; She called as she got a 
clean washcloth and soaked it in cool water.

Fujin was altogether furious at herself. She&#146;d always been prone to 
illness but usually fought through it with sheer tenaciousness. She was 
not accustomed to being babied and she found it unsettling. She sat up 
and immediately regretted it, her stomach revolted against her by 
turning upside down. She jumped up and charged headlong into the 
bathroom, with one swift motion she pulled Quistis out the door and then 
locking herself inside.

&quot;Hey!?&quot; Quistis called as she fell on her rear in the floor. Noises that 
no living thing should make echoed from the depths of the bathroom.

&quot;All those egg rolls for dinner last night eh?&quot; Quistis smiled 
sympathetically as she waited.

After about thirty minutes and what seemed like an entire tube of 
toothpaste Fujin exited the bathroom paler that usual and swaying. 
Quistis sat on the edge of the bed looking worried.

&quot;Feeling better?&quot;

Fujin looked at her dully as she shuffled to the bed and collapsed face 
first in a heap.

&quot;Poor thing.&quot; Quistis rubbed her back soothingly.

&quot;You want to try to eat anything? I&#146;ll get it for you.&quot;

Fujin shook her head.

&quot;I&#146;m going to get dressed and go get some things for you. Anything you 
want in particular?&quot;

Fujin shook her head again.

&quot;Okay hon, I&#146;ll be back in a few.&quot; Quistis said brightly then patted her 
on the rear, Fujin&#146;s eye went wide in shock at the gesture but was to 
drained to comment.

Several minutes later Quistis was dressed and walking up the boardwalks 
looking for a shop. She forgot her map and was clueless as to where to 
look. She stopped a elderly man with a beard that was tucked into his 
pants.

&quot;Sir do you know if they have a Pharmacy or something of the like here.&quot;

&quot;EH!?&quot; The man shouted at her with a mouth devoid of teeth causing her 
to pause.

&quot;Pharmacy, drugstore.&quot; She tried.

&quot;EH?!&quot;

&quot;First aid kit, cough syrup anything like that?&quot;

&quot;EH?!&quot;

&quot;Your not hearing a word I&#146;m saying are you.

&quot;EH!?&quot;

&quot;Quistis shook her head in defeat and walked away.

*****************************

It wasn&#146;t long until trouble found Aeka and her partner. A large orb 
like creature swooped down out of no where and slammed into her back 
knocking her over. She skidded a few feet on her chest and face before 
ending up in a dusty heap.

&quot;GAHH!&quot; She screamed in shock and pain as she rolled over on her back to 
see what hit her. The creature was a bright red scaly ball nearly four 
feet in diameter, it had molten pools of yellow for eyes and steam 
billowed out of its bony-ridged mouth. Fire danced atop the things head 
and heat like a oven roiled off its body.

&quot;BOMB!&quot; She yelled and scrambled to get out of the way as gouts of flame 
ignited under her feet. She jumped up dancing madly as her boots caught 
afire. Nei was already in motion, leaping at the creature and slashing 
with steel claws that where attached to bracers on her forearms. The 
Bomb turned to face her and quickly locked its bony mouth on her arm. 
The metal guards, the only thing keeping it from boiling the skin off 
her arm.

Zell leaned up against the tree watching with growing interest as Aeka 
kicked off her smoldering boots and trying to focus for a spell.

Nei slammed her free fist and claw into the thing&#146;s eye; the eye gave 
way all too easy and covered her hand in steaming gore. They both 
screamed in pain and separated from each other.

&quot;Incoming!&quot; Aeka shouted to Nei as a blue light shone over the creature. 
It looked up and gurgled incoherently as star shaped mass of ice 
exploded around the creature trapping it creature. Nei hobbled back away 
as the creature roared in pain and anger, as it&#146;s internal heat melted 
the ice away. The monster turned to face Aeka and quickly swelled to 
more than double its size. Zell whistled apprehensively and quietly 
slipped behind a tree but kept a wary eye. Nei took the opportunity to 
focus on a healing spell, its soothing white light washing away the 
horrible burns on her arms.

&quot;Aeka beware!&quot; She called as she began to channel another spell. The 
creature opened its mouth and a sound like a backed up drain issued 
forth from deep in its bowels. Aeka in a panic threw her boot at it at 
the last second. Hitting it in its damaged eye, the thing howled spun 
away from her as it let loose a fiery ball from its mouth. The ball hit 
the tree Zell was hiding behind blowing it to pieces. Zell scrambled to 
get out of the way as the tree fell over with a mighty crash. Nei stood 
her ground focusing intently as a shape began to slowly manifesting 
around her.

&quot;Keep it busy Aeka.&quot; Nei shouted through clenched teeth as she 
concentrated on the summons.

&quot;I&#146;m trying!&quot; Aeka shouted as she dove behind a rock just as another 
fireball slammed into it. She sniffed and smelt burning hair and 
realized it was hers. She jumped up startled smacking at her head 
wildly. Zell nearly laughed aloud at her antics seeing that she was 
okay. He did not notice as the creature drifted down behind him 
silently. Its mouth shut tight in grim determination, it knew it was 
dying and would have revenge. It began to shake and swell even larger. 
Aeka put her hair out and looked about for the creature and saw it 
hovering behind Zell.

&quot;ZELL!&quot; Aeka screamed in horror.

Zell spun around to see the creature begin to rupture, its scales 
breaking away as the imminent explosion tore at its insides.

&quot;Aw shit.&quot; Zell gulped as he threw his arms up in defense and close his 
eyes.

A loud cracking sound filled the air and then silence. Zell stood still 
for a moment before opening a wary eye.

&quot;Wha?&quot;

The beast was before him mouth agape and split open but frozen solid in 
a block of ice. A tall woman of unearthly alien beauty leaned against 
the block grinning at him. She was slender and shapely but most 
remarkable she was blue with long tendrils draping back from her skull.

&quot;Ah Shiva.&quot; He nodded then sighed in relief before turning to look for 
his students.

&quot;Um good work guys.&quot; He said scratching his head in wonder.

Nei beamed proudly and shouted in victory as Aeka searched about on her 
hands and knees for her other boot.

They walked back into the waiting room weary but victorious. Zell 
scribbled his report in a journal then sat down waiting for the others. 
Royce walked over in shock at Aeka&#146;s frazzled smoldering head.

&quot;Dear Hyne what happened to you?&quot;

Aeka just coughed and sat down to rest.

&quot;Nice job with the shoe Aeka, very innovative.&quot; Nei smirked.

&quot;Shoe?&quot; Royce asked curiously.

****************************

After a long annoying while Quistis finally found a staff member and all 
but tackled him.

&quot;Excuse me, a moment of your time please.&quot; She asked with bluntness.

&quot;Well hello.&quot; The man smiled saucily, he looked like the devil Quistis 
thought. He had curly black hair, dark eyes and a pointed goatee. The 
red and black sweater didn&#146;t help.

&quot;My friends taken ill and I was wondering if you sold and medicine here, 
or if a pharmacy or some such was nearby.&quot;

The man rubbed his chin and stared at her with unabashed lecherous 
intent.

&quot;Well lovely lady.&quot; He flexed and folded his large arms in thought. She 
amused herself by imagining him prancing about wearing a fig leaf and 
wielding with a pitchfork. She nearly giggled at the lunacy of it all.

&quot;We do have a shop on the east wing of the building that has basic 
medical stuff, insulin, medication, first aid kits and the like.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Quistis smiled a wooden smile.

&quot;I&#146;m a med student.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s nice.&quot; She walked away hurriedly before he could try to nab her 
in small talk.

 

Fujin lay face down on the bed unmoving as her throat threatened to 
ignite. A loud knock on the door made her skull feel as though it had 
just been stuffed with hot lead.

&quot;NO NWAY&quot; She bellowed making her head throb more.

The door rattled with keys then opened as an overweight woman in maids 
attire wobbled into the room pulling a cart. Fujin rolled over to see 
who dared trespass on her misery.

&quot;Clean room!&quot; The woman said in a thick accent and smiling hugely.

&quot;NHAT NELL?&quot; Fujin sniffed and gawked at her.

&quot;Muchichi not Nell.&quot; The woman pointed to her nametag&quot;. Sure enough it 
read &#150;Muchichi-.

The woman turned on some music as she began to dust and clean, the music 
was full of ill-timed chimes, bells, gongs and chanting. The cacophony 
threatened to drive Fujin into a murderous rage.

&quot;NOUT!&quot; Fujin roared and slung a pillow at her. The woman screeched in 
shock and surprise as she ran out of the room with cart in tow and 
cursing in some foreign language.

Fujin slid out of bed and stalked to the door, hanging the &#150;do not 
disturb- sign before she locking it.

Quistis walked back from the shop with a bag full of assorted medicines 
and hot teas. She couldn&#146;t resist and snagged an adorable stuffed panda 
dressed in winter clothes. She hoped Fujin would like it, the thought of 
her making her feel warm and giddy.

&quot;You&#146;re acting like a ninny.&quot; She told herself but she didn&#146;t care. For 
the fist time in a long, long time she could actually say she was happy.

&quot;Quistis?&quot; A deep voice called behind her. Quistis stiffened in shock 
she knew that voice, she slowly turned holding her breath. The dark 
tanned man before her was tall, and powerfully built. He wore a heavy 
dark brown coat and black leather pants with a scraggy wool toboggan 
atop his wide square head. Unusual attire from what she was used to but 
she remembered his face all to well.

The man engulfed her in a bear hug that threatened to snuff the life out 
of her.

&quot;Imagine meeting you in a place like this ya know!&quot; He bellowed merrily.

&quot;Raijin!?&quot; She said with shaky smile.</pre>
