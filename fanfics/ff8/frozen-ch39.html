&quot;I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing.&quot; Xu all but cried in a mix of excitement 
and fear as she struggled with the controls.

&quot;Like that&#146;s ever stopped you before.&quot; Quistis laughed good-naturedly.

&quot;Oh you hussy!&quot; Xu turned a made a face at her. &quot;You think you can do 
better feel free to come up here and try.&quot;

&quot;Hmm no I think its more fun to watch you.&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;Um Xu.&quot; Nida said cautiously.

&quot;You don&#39;t think I can do it?&quot; Xu put her hands on her hips and glared 
at Quistis.

&quot;Did I say that?&quot; Quistis winked at her.

&quot;Care to take a bet?&quot; Xu offered confidently.

&quot;Xu.&quot; Nida said again, his expression sober.

&quot;A bet, sure why not, I need a new dress anyway.&quot; Quistis smiled.

&quot;Fine, I bet you my next paycheck that. I can learn to master this in 
two days time. If I win you fork over yours.&quot;

Quistis looked to Nida and noticed the grim look he was giving Xu.

&quot;You have a bet.&quot; She nodded briskly.

&quot;Oh you&#39;re going to loose you&#39;re ass on this one Quisty.&quot; Xu giggled 
maniacally.

&quot;Somehow I doubt that.&quot; Quistis assured her.

&quot;Xu!&quot; Nida coughed loudly.

&quot;What in the world is it Nida, I&#39;m talking to Quistis here.&quot;

&quot;Mountain.&quot; He said cautiously, his face twitching as he fought the urge 
to take the controls.

&quot;Wha?&quot; Xu turned around her view was dominated by sheer rock.

Quistis screamed.

*

Balamb Garden banked hard to the left while rising at a staggering 
speed. The various antenna and sensors beneath the great vessel 
screeched and scraped along the granite face of the mountain peak it&#39;d 
nearly collided with.

*

Cid walked onto the bridge, curious as to what just happened. He was 
covered with the remnants of a hoagie sandwich and drenched in coffee.

&quot;Is there a problem Nida?&quot; He asked in a fatherly tone while surveying 
the scene before him. Quistis was crouched with her arms over her head. 
Nida stood at the controls ashen faced. While Xu, picked herself up off 
the floor.

&quot;&quot;Everything&#39;s fine sir.&quot; He said shakily.

&quot;Good, good.&quot; Cid nodded. He knew better than to ask in situations like 
this. He gave one last glance around the bridge then went back to his 
office.

Still wide-eyed and shaking Quistis looked at Xu who was clutching her 
chest and panting.

&quot;You can just deposit that into my account.&quot;

*********

Fujin picked herself up off the gym floor cursing under her breath. She 
heard Nida over the intercom apologizing for the turbulence.

&quot;CLUMSY.&quot; She grumbled.

&quot;You okay Miss Fujin?&quot; Aeka asked worriedly as she too rose to her feet.

&quot;FUJIN.&quot;

&quot;Sorry Ma&#39;am, that was some jolt huh?&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

Fujin walked over to one of the many mats that where laid out on the gym 
floor.

&quot;I&#39;m curious?&quot;

&quot;ABOUT?&quot;

&quot;Why&#39;d you bring me out here?&quot;

&quot;REMOVE SHOE&#39;S&quot;

&quot;What, Why?&quot;

&quot;TRAINING.&quot;

&quot;Training?&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Huh you mean you&#39;re training me?&quot;

Fujin nodded, she was growing impatient answering redundant questions.

&quot;Quistis asked you to do this didn&#39;t she.&quot;

&quot;PARTIALLY.&quot; Fujin admitted.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to be a hassle.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin scowled and stretched.

&quot;Okay then, how do we start.&quot; Aeka asked curiously as she joined her in 
the exercises.

&quot;BASICS.&quot;

&quot;Zell and Mr. Rozan already taught us the basic stuff.&quot;

&quot;USELESS, YOU ARE WEAK.&quot;

Aeka shirked and frowned.

&quot;I know.&quot; She said in a small voice.

Fujin shook her head and sighed. She didn&#39;t mean it like that.

&quot;NEED DIFFERENT STYLE.&quot; She tried again.

&quot;What do you mean.&quot;

&quot;This is going to take a while.&quot; Fujin thought.

&quot;STYLE FOR YOU, NOT THEM.&quot;

&quot;Oh I get it. Because I&#39;m smaller what works for them doesn&#39;t for me?&quot; 
Aeka brightened a bit.

Fujin nodded and pondered a moment. While she was younger and training 
for the War God tournament she&#39;d been lucky in having caught the 
attention of Master Mai Tsu. Master Tsu was elderly and had retired from 
teaching years before. Fujin had convinced Tsu to tutor her and she did 
so until her death. Tsu was a small wispy woman much like Fujin was at 
the time. Her style was a mixture of various arts and focused on speed 
and defense. She was also taught the need for patience while waiting for 
an opening. Looking at Aeka Fujin thought it would suit her best of all.

&quot;SETSU ZSU.&quot; Fujin said evenly. Aeka looked baffled.

&quot;MARTIAL ART.&quot;

&quot;Oh wow, is that what you use?&quot;

&quot;AMONG OTHERS.&quot;

&quot;Why that one?&quot;

&quot;FITTING FOR YOU.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough.&quot;

Fujin walked over to the younger girl.

&quot;So what&#39;s the basis of the style? I&#39;ve never heard of it.&quot; Aeka asked 
curiously right before Fujin swept her feet.

******************

Quistis sat across from Xu who was sulking over her ice cream sundae.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t be so mad Heart.&quot; Quistis giggled.

Xu looked up sourly at the nickname she used while in the card club.

&quot;I haven&#39;t played triple triad in over a year.&quot; She said thoughtfully.

&quot;Why not? You used to love to play.&quot; Quistis smiled as she sipped her 
tea.

&quot;I dunno.&quot; Xu shrugged. &quot;I&#39;ve just been so busy keeping the students in 
line.&quot;

&quot;You should get back into it.&quot;

&quot;Yeah I guess. Do you still play?&quot;

&quot;Me, heavens no? I&#39;ve been a bit out of sorts until lately.&quot; Quistis 
blushed faintly.

&quot;I&#39;m glad we made up, ya know.&quot; Xu smiled brightly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for all 
that mess a few weeks ago.&quot;

&quot;Me too, I just chalk it up to the both of us being stressed out.&quot;

&quot;I suppose.&quot;

&quot;How are you and Nida doing, You two serious?&quot; Quistis leaned forward 
hoping for some juicy tidbits. Xu laughed aloud.

&quot;We are fine you hound.&quot;

&quot;Just fine?&quot; Quistis arched a brow.

&quot;Yes fine.&quot; Xu said evenly choosing not to divulge anymore information.

&quot;Un huh.&quot; Quistis smirked and took another sip of her drink.

&quot;So how are things between you and Fujin?&quot; Xu asked with a downright 
devilish grin. Quistis nearly spit up her tea and went into a fit of 
coughing.

Xu sat patiently for the fit to pass. Several students in the cafeteria 
looked at the two curiously.

&quot;That good huh.&quot; Xu chuckled.

**********

The island of hell was aptly named it was predominately covered in 
rainforest and the heat and humidity was stifling. The Raganrok sat 
safely nestled amid towering trees. In the short time since it&#39;s landing 
a troupe of long tailed monkeys discovered that one could make all sorts 
of interesting noises by bouncing various materials off it&#39;s metal hull.

&quot;I&#39;m going to kill those damn monkeys.&quot; Zell cursed bitterly from his 
resting-place directly atop a cooling vent.

&quot;Zell I&#39;m trying to sleep.&quot; Squall said with quiet anger as he lay 
kicked back in the pilot seat.

Another hail of pings and dings echoed through the hull of the ship.

&quot;Damn it.&quot; Zell cursed.

&quot;Zell if you want me to go with you in the morning then be quiet.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, I just know they are making a mess of the paint job.&quot;

&quot;Zell!&quot;

&quot;Sorry man.&quot; Zell shirked and rolled over trying to get comfortable.

Down below in the main hull, two figures slipped quietly out of a cargo 
bin. With great care they crept quietly to one of the exits.

&quot;Now be quiet the last thing we need to do is get caught.&quot; Luccian 
whispered harshly.

&quot;I know that you ass. What&#146;s the plan here?&quot; Archibald snapped.

Luccian pulled the black multifaceted stone he acquired in Eshtar from 
his pocket. The stone glowed with an eerie dull red glow.

Archibald eyed the stone warily.

&quot;What the hell?&quot;

Luccian smiled richly.

&quot;Yeees.&quot; He hissed and hit the release panel on the exit. The hatch 
hissed open and the hot night air hit them in the face.

&quot;I hope you&#39;re right about that thing leading us to the temple.&quot; 
Archibald said while slipping on his backpack.

&quot;I&#39;m sure about it calm down. Now hurry up we got to go and get back 
before they do.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry I ain&#39;t getting stranded here.&quot;

Careful to shut the exit Luccian made sure he had the extra card key he 
swiped from Zell. They&#39;d need it if they had any hope of getting back 
inside the ship.

The monkeys that where assaulting the ship let loose a series of shrill 
shriek and yells as the two set off.

&quot;Geeze.&quot; Archibald shouted at he was pelted with rocks, twigs and feces.

&quot;Come on.&quot; Luccian patted him on the shoulder and took off running into 
the darkness.

It wasn&#39;t long until the duo discovered one of the more insidious 
creatures that dominated the wilds of the island.

Luccian held up the stone, turning slowly and gauged the light&#39;s 
reaction.

&quot;Um Dude.&quot; Archibald said with a tingle of trepidation.

&quot;What!&quot; Luccian snapped.

Archibald shone his light on his friend&#39;s back and twitched nervously.

&quot;Dude there&#39;s something on you.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Luccian said with odd calm.

&quot;You&#39;re back.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s probably a tree leech. Get it off.&quot; Luccin tried to look but 
couldn&#39;t get a good enough view.

&quot;That&#146;s no leech man.&quot;

&quot;What the fuck is it then!?&quot; Luccian shouted, he was getting fearful 
now.

&quot;Look like a naked fat bat.&quot; Archibald grabbed a stick and prodded the 
thing, its flesh gave all to easy like it was mostly liquid on the 
inside.

&quot;Nasty man, I think it&#39;s feeding of ya.&quot; He made a disgusted face.

&quot;GET IT THE FUCK OFF ME!&quot; Luccian bellowed.

&quot;Oh yeah sure thing.&quot;

&quot;Hurry up.&quot; Luccian was nearly hopping up and down with agitation.

Archibald made a move and paused.

&quot;How?&quot;

&quot;A pointy stick, fire, your friggin hands, I don&#39;t care just get the 
thing!&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot; Archibald retrieved his weighted bo staff he kept strapped his 
back.

We twirled it over his head and brought it down sharply across Luccian&#39;s 
back. The sound was something akin to a water balloon being dropped from 
high. Luccian shouted in pain and anger even as the creature on his back 
ruptured into a spray of yellow and red icor.

&quot;EWWW DAMN!&quot; Archibald hopped back horrified.

&quot;Gah you bastard!&quot; Luccian writhed around holding his back and covered 
in dripping foul smelling fluid.

&quot;Hey I got it at least.&quot;

&quot;I should kick your ass you shit!&quot; Luccian yelled and kicked a near 
tree.

Rubbing his aching back he trudged off into the underbrush.

*************

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be joining you guys.&quot; Nicole said sorrowfully.

&quot;Huh why not? You afraid of the water?&quot; Selphie said as she slipped on a 
yellow one-piece bathing suit.

&quot;EEK that&#146;s adorable!&quot; Rinoa cooed and fawned over her.

&quot;No I&#39;m not afraid of water.&quot; Nicole said simply

&quot;Come on now, they just rebuilt the pool your not going to spend the 
afternoon sulking about are you?&quot; Rinoa prodded as she retrieved a 
silver and black bikini from her bag.

&quot;Someone&#39;s feeling Risqu&eacute;.&quot; Selphie giggled and pointed to the suit. 
&quot;How&#39;s the saying go? While the cat&#39;s away the mice will play.&quot;

&quot;Please.&quot; Rinoa rolled her eyes.

&quot;When are Squall and Zell coming back.&quot; Nicole said trying to change the 
subject.

&quot;I dunno they are running a flight test or some mess on the Raganrok.&quot; 
Rinoa shrugged.

&quot;Are you going or not.&quot; Selphie huffed putting her hands on her small 
hips.

&quot;Leave me alone I don&#39;t have a suit anyway.&quot; Nicole said getting 
slightly irked

&quot;You&#39;re in shorts just wear those.&quot; Rinoa noted as she got changed into 
her suit.

&quot;You can borrow one of mine sugar.&quot; Celest said as she walked into the 
changing room. Somehow every word that left the woman&#39;s mouth dripped 
with lewd subtlety.

&quot;It&#39;d never fit.&quot; Nicole said bluntly.

&quot;Your call.&quot; Celest said as she stripped.

The three girls looked warily at each other as Celest squeezed into a 
rowdy black two-piece that left little to the imagination.

&quot;You are NOT going out dressed like that.&quot; Selphie all but ordered.

&quot;Whoa you&#39;re braver than I am.&quot; Rinoa gawked in a mix of horror and awe.

&quot;I thought you where sick why are you even here?&quot; Celest soured and made 
a face at her.

&quot;I&#39;m better, Miss I&#39;m too sexy for my suit.&quot; Selphie said sarcastically.

&quot;I&#39;ll be outside.&quot; Nicole blushed and shuffled past.

&quot;What!?&quot; Celest frowned. &quot;To much?&quot;

&quot;To little.&quot; Selphie mumbled under her breath.

&quot;Oh yeah waaaay to much.&quot; Rinoa said blushing.

&quot;You gals have no sense of adventure.&quot; Celest rolled her eyes and walked 
out into the pool area.

&quot;She&#39;s a floozy.&quot; Rinoa said quietly.

&quot;Like brother like sister.&quot; Selphie sighed.

&quot;That&#39;s your boyfriend you&#39;re talking about.&quot; Rinoa pointed out.

&quot;So, it&#39;s the truth.&quot; Selphie giggled and headed out.

Rinoa was feeling a headache brewing but followed quietly.

Nicole padded quietly around the edge of the pool as the others 
frolicked and beat each other senseless with foam water sticks. She 
didn&#39;t even notice as Selphie swam up and propped herself on the edge of 
the pool.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong Nikki? You seem gloomy?&quot; She asked worriedly.

&quot;I miss Zell.&quot; Nicole pouted.

&quot;He&#39;s not even been gone a day yet silly.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot;

&quot;Then cheer up. How long could it possibly take?&quot;

&quot;I know, I&#39;m being silly.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, true and you&#39;re making me depressed so stop with the frowning.&quot; 
Selphie scolded then abruptly grabbed her by the shorts and yanked her 
into the pool. With a mortified scream Nicole hit the water flailing and 
cussing.

Nicole came up sputtering and slashing madly.

&quot;HELP!&quot; She screamed in utter terror. Selphie tried to grab her to calm 
her down but received a kick to the head for her effort.

&quot;Oh dear.&quot; Celest frowned looked over at the two.

&quot;I thought as much.&quot; Rinoa sighed and swam over to them.&quot;

Firm hands snatched one of Nicole&#39;s arms and yanked her bodily out of 
the water.

&quot;You gals need to learn to play nice.&quot; Irvine chuckled as Nicole spat 
and struggled in his arms.

&quot;Irvine!?&quot; Nicole coughed and sank to her knees panting. Selphie peeked 
above the water embarrassed.

&quot;Sorry Nikki.&quot; She said softly.

&quot;Way to go small-fry.&quot; Celest poked her.

&quot;Celest.&quot; Rinoa said cautiously.

&quot;So this is where you&#39;re all hidin?&quot; Irvine said as he sat down and 
pulled off his boots.

&quot;Yup.&quot; Celest nodded. &quot;We woulda woke you up but someone is a piss-head 
when he doesn&#39;t get his beauty sleep.&quot; She laughed.

Rinoa swam over to where Nicole sat wet and miserable.

&quot;Hey Nikki you okay?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Nicole mumbled.

Selphie joined them and sat quiet for a moment.

&quot;Sorry, I wish you told me you couldn&#39;t swim.&quot; She said meekly.

&quot;It&#39;s okay I forgive you.&quot; Nicole smiled thinly.

&quot;That&#146;s my Selphie forever into trouble.&quot; Irvine laughed as he stripped 
to his boxers and dived into the pool.

&quot;Oh you bugger.&quot; Selphie splashed at him sourly.

&quot;I can teach you if you want?&quot; Rinoa offered thoughtfully.

&quot;I dunno.&quot; Nicole said somewhat unsure.

&quot;Come on honey it&#39;s a piece of cake. If I can do it anyone can.&quot; Celest 
laughed.

&quot;Yeah and she&#39;s retarded.&quot; Selphie beamed merrily.

&quot;Oh stop that.&quot; Nicole laughed.

Irvine popped up by Celest and eyed her dubiously.

&quot;What!?&quot; She snapped crabbily.

&quot;So this is what you call dressing down?&quot; He scoffed.

&quot;Go away you clown.&quot; She shoved him back under the water.

&quot;Come on Nikki you can do it. It&#39;ll be fun trust me.&quot; Rinoa offered a 
hand.

&quot;Yeah Nikki trust us there&#39;s nothing to worry about.&quot; Selphie smiled 
then vomited into the water.

******************

&quot;KAI!&quot; Aeka screamed and punched awkwardly at Fujin who just stepped 
left and tripped her. Aeka landed on the mat with a thud.

&quot;BETTER BUT SLOW.&quot; Fujin nodded.

&quot;I&#39;m never going to get this.&quot; Aeka sulked.

&quot;THEN QUIT.&quot; Fujin said simply and turned to leave.

&quot;WAIT!&quot; Aeka shouted in dismay.

Fujin paused and looked over her shoulder.

&quot;Sorry I&#39;m ready to continue.&quot;

&quot;WEAPONS NOW.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;YOU HAVE WEAPONS?&quot;

&quot;I guess.&quot; Aeka blushed feeling a bit silly.

&quot;SHOW ME.&quot;

Aeka nodded and went over to her backpack. She retrieved a small 
carrying case and padded back to where Fujin stood. Opening the case she 
reviled the set of small throwing knifes.

&quot;These where a gift from a old friend of mine. I used to be with a 
circus and he thought me to use them.&quot; She explained, though Fujin 
seemed not to care about their origin.

&quot;TINY, NEAR USELESS.&quot;

&quot;Great.&quot; Aeka sighed and hung her head.

&quot;NEAR USLESS.&quot; Fujin reassured her and pointed to the nearby weapons 
hall where students came to practice with various weapons.

&quot;COME.&quot; She said firmly and grabbed her chakram.

&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am.&quot; Aeka followed dutifully.

Fujin signed them in and went to stand at front of a long hall littered 
with standing target dummies.

She closed her eye and focused intently. Then with one swift motion she 
let flight the large pinwheel shaped chakram. The weapon arced through 
the air taking the head off one dummy and lodging halfway into the chest 
of the one behind it.

&quot;Whoa.&quot; Aeka blinked

&quot;YOUR TURN.&quot; Fujin ordered.

&quot;Um okay.&quot; Aeka said nervously and took a handful of knives in hand. 
With a speed that Fujin found slightly surprising she let fly three 
knives in rapid succession. One stuck the closest target in the face and 
sank in solidly. The second hit the torso of another. The last hit the 
stomach of the dummy but fell out after failing to stick firmly.

&quot;NOT BAD.&quot; Fujin nodded somewhat impressed. She&#39;d figured the girl&#39;s aim 
was horrible.

&quot;Really.&quot; Aeka beamed.

&quot;NOT GOOD EITHER.&quot; Fujin shrugged and retrieved the weapons.

&quot;Great.&quot; Aeka huffed slightly miffed.

Fujin sheathed her chakram and studied the knives a moment.

&quot;WATCH.&quot; She said firmly then with one wide arc of her arm she flung the 
knives through the air. The blades whistled loudly then impacted one 
after another into the neck of a dummy a good distance away.

&quot;Showoff.&quot; Aeka mumbled.

&quot;YOU WILL LEARN.&quot; Fujin looked down at her. Aeka walked and got the 
blades. She had to fight a bit to get them free.

&quot;You&#146;re stronger than I am that not really fair.&quot; Aeka pointed out.

&quot;MATTERS LITTLE.&quot; Fujin said folding her arms.

&quot;I dunno.&quot;

&quot;ACCURACY MOST IMPORTANT.&quot;

&quot;I guess.&quot;

&quot;TRY AGAIN.&quot;

Akea bit her lip and let loose the knives again one after another. She 
was rusty and not used to throwing at such far targets. The first blade 
hit one dummy in the groin. The second blade sank into it leg and the 
third hit it in the stomach.&quot;

&quot;BETTER.&quot; Fujin nodded.

&quot;Cool.&quot; Aeka said proudly.

&quot;TO FAST.&quot; Fujin said as she pulled the blades out.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;YOU FOCUS ON SPEED.&quot;

&quot;What that have to do with anything?&quot;

&quot;SLOW DOWN.&quot;

&quot;You threw them fast.

&quot;I&#39;M BETTER.&quot; Fujin said with annoying bluntness.

&quot;But.&quot; Aeka frowned.

&quot;FOCUS ON ACCURACY.&quot;

&quot;Alright then...&quot; Akea sighed. Fujin handed her the blades. With a frown 
she took a moment to focus her sight on one of the targets then one by 
one she tossed the blades at it. This time she fared better, all three 
sank in snugly about the dummies chest.

&quot;BETTER.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Aeka smiled.

&quot;BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH.&quot; Fujin added.

Aeka could have scream in frustration. What did Fujin want from her?

&quot;TRY HARDER.&quot; Fujin went out into the hall and pushed the target back 
farther and retrieved the knives.

&quot;PRACTICE.&quot; She said evenly and passing the blades back to their owner. 
She then headed for the exit.

&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Aeka asked dumbfounded.

&quot;HUNGRY.&quot; Fujin said without looking back and left.

Aeka grumble sourly and threw the knives in a huff. None hit their mark.

*******************

Xu and Quistis sat laughing and chatting as they&#39;d doing been for the 
last few hours. They&#39;d not really spoken in months and now were busily 
catching up on old times. Fujin was surprised to see them and 
contemplated joining them as she got in line for food. Xu saw her first 
and looked at Quistis thoughtfully.

&quot;There&#39;s your buddy.&quot; She said with a shrewd smirk.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Quistis blinked and turned in her seat.

&quot;Want to call her over?&quot; Xu asked.

&quot;She&#39;s not one for social chats. I doubt she would.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;What&#39;s her story anyway? How&#39;d you two become friends. I mean really, 
of all people. She&#39;s a Seifer crony and you hang out with her?&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s all in the past now.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;If you say so.&quot; Xu shrugged and watched Fujin curiously.

&quot;She seems happier if that&#146;s even possible with her, it&#39;s hard to tell.&quot;

&quot;I suppose.&quot; Quistis said quietly and sipped her drink while sorely 
wishing to change the subject.

Xu turned back to her and smiled abruptly.

&quot;I know what you need.&quot; Xu nodded briskly.

&quot;Oh gods.&quot; Quistis looked worried she&#39;d heard such an announcement from 
Selphie and it ended in disaster.

&quot;Let&#39;s go on a double date.&quot; Xu beamed. I have tickets to an opera in 
Deling and we&#39;ll be landing there in tomorrow night.

&quot;Date?&quot; Quistis stammered.

&quot;Sure why not. There&#39;s a cute guy I could introduce you to if you don&#39;t 
have anyone to go with.&quot; Xu smiled a mischievous smile.

&quot;Um no thank you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;ll be fun and it&#39;s your favorite.&quot; Xu teased.

&quot;La Nautica Forever?&quot; Quistis said startled.

&quot;The one and only.&quot; Xu smirked.

&quot;I haven&#39;t seen that in years.&quot; Quistis moaned dreamily.

Fujin walked by and nodded peaceably to the two before heading to a 
nearby seat. Quistis was slightly disappointed that she didn&#146;t join 
them.

&quot;So you want to meet him? He&#39;s a second year upperclassmen and really 
cute.&quot; Xu smiled. Overhearing the last part Fujin abruptly turned and 
sat down with them.

&quot;HI.&quot; She blurted weirdly with an accusing look in her eye. It took 
every bit of willpower Quistis could muster not to crack up.

&quot;Um hello.&quot; Xu blinked somewhat taken aback.

Fujin smiled a downright creepy smile and started to eat. Quistis choked 
back a laugh and took another sip from her glass.

&quot;As I was saying.&quot; Xu said slowly.

&quot;He likes opera too. We talked about it while I training him in advanced 
espionage. So you want me to talk to him?&quot;

&quot;OPERA?&quot; Fujin said with feigned curiosity while shoveling food in an 
attempt to act -normal.

Smiling hugely Quistis nodded. &quot;Oh yes, it&#39;s called La Nautica Forever.&quot;

Xu nodded and looked at Fujin warily.

&quot;INTRESTING.&quot; Fujin huffed.

&quot;You like opera?&quot; Xu said in muffled disbelief.

&quot;VERY MUCH.&quot; Fujin lied.

&quot;Yeah okay...&quot; Xu said looking at Quistis who shrugged helplessly.

&quot;She has two extra tickets. I&#39;m sure she wouldn&#39;t mind you tagging 
along. Right Xu?&quot; Quistis said as she and Fujin both looked at her 
expectantly.

&quot;Um...Sure.&quot; Xu nodded slowly with a catty grin. She thought it best to 
not let them know she made the guy up.

*********************

Luccian burst into the clearing torn up and bloody, Archibald was hot on 
his heels and screaming like a woman. A creature of titanic sized burst 
into the clearing after them. It was an enormous bipedal thing with a 
squat neck, and a massive head with far to many teeth. It&#39;s legs where 
thick and powerful and had no arms. Out of its back it sported a series 
of sharp scythe like bones, each of which as big as a large man. The 
thing&#39;s hide was scaly and blood red and an unholy white light shined 
out of it beady eyes.

&quot;WE&#39;RE GOING TO DIE!&quot; Archibald screamed shrilly.

The creature roared in agreement, a sound that rumbled the ground 
underfoot. It&#39;s steaming hot breath washing over them, smelling of death 
itself.

&quot;FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!&quot; Luccian bellowed while trying concentrate on a 
summons spell. He&#39;d been assigned Diablos, a demonic looking guardian 
force with the power of gravity. He prayed he could focus enough to 
bring the beast forth. A loud whooshing sound filled the air and he 
turned slightly to look. The beast had somehow slung one of the scythes 
from its back at them. The blade spun through the air like some 
hell-spawned Frisbee. Archibald took that opportunity to trip, a feat of 
luck that saved his life. Luccian felt the surge of power as Diablos 
began to channel forth, an act that sadly made Luccian pause in his 
tracks. Luccian screamed and the blade stuck him square in the 
midsection there was a flare of black light and a tremendous 
otherworldly roar as Diablos shimmered briefly above him then quickly 
vanished into a puff of black stinking smoke. Luccian was hurled back 
against the tree with a sickening thud but miraculously was relatively 
unhurt. The beast stormed headlong towards him with it&#39;s mouth agape. 
Luccian sat in stupefied terror staring down the black pit of the 
creature&#39;s mouth. Archibald took the opportunity to call forth a spell. 
He wasn&#39;t the best at magic but it was his best chance at the moment.

&quot;QUAKE!&quot; He shouted and slammed his fist into the ground. A ridge of 
rocks and debris shot into the air forming a path to the creature. The 
creature spun around at the noise right as a pillar of stone slammed 
into it&#39; stomach. The creature belched loudly and pillar crumbled. 
Archibald laughed with madness and Luccian looked around in a panic.

&quot;ARCH OVER HERE!&quot; He shouted, noticing a gaping hole that had formed 
when the spell fired off. No idea where it led but anything was better 
than the guarantee of death if they stayed. The monster bellowed once 
and lunged for Archibald who looked as if he would faint. Luccian drew 
his sword and in an unorthodox move stabbed the beast in the ass. The 
attack had the desired effect and caught the creature&#39;s attention; he 
quickly dived for the hole and screamed for Archibald to follow. 
Snapping out of his stupor Archibald charged the pit and falling 
headlong into it.

Deprived of its meal the beast threw a complete and utter fit that 
threatened to bring down the jungle around it.



Luccian was the first to awaken, a dull thrumming howled in his skull 
and he sat up moaning. Archibald lay atop a nearby rock, his head coated 
in dried blood. Luccian&#39;s first thought was that he was dead.

&quot;Damn it...Arch.&quot; He said quietly and went to his side.

He places a hand on his friend&#39;s neck and was relived to find a pulse. 
His link to Diablos had been severed when the creature attack depleted 
its energy. He would not be able to summon the creature for sometime or 
until he took proper means to restore the energy lost. Luckily though, 
he was still junctioned to the guardian and could call on it&#39;s magic.

Concentrating hard and pushing out the annoying thrumming in his head he 
called forth a spell of healing. The white light spread over them both 
and soon Archibald slid of the rock he&#39;d landed on and hit the ground 
moaning.

&quot;What the hell happened.&quot; He gurgled.

&quot;You landed on your fool head.&quot; Luccian chuckled and pulled the 
searching stone from his pocket. The black rock flared brightly and 
Luccian realized the noise in his head was coming from it.

&quot;Where&#39;s the monster?&quot; Archibald said worriedly.

Luccian pointed to the star filled night sky shining through the hole 
they&#39;d fallen through.

&quot;Where are we?&quot; Was Archibald&#39;s next question.

&quot;Close to our goal I think. Come on, you&#39;re feeble spell may have opened 
up cave that I think may be a shortcut.&quot; Luccian said as he switched on 
his flashlight.

&quot;Whoopee I can&#39;t wait.&quot; Archibald said dryly as they made their way 
through the darkened cave.</pre>
