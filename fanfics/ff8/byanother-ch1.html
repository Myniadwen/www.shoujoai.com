<h1>To Be Loved By Another</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff8/index.html">Final Fantasy  8</a>

<pre>	The sun slowly began its rise over the mountains, illuminating the 
green valley with golden rays and the two young women who were laying on 
top of a small hill.  They were still slumbering, tightly embracing each 
other for warmth.  The blonde-haired girl moved first, moaning a little 
as the sunlight shined on her face.  Opening her eyes to the dawn, 
Quistis carefully disentangled herself from her companion, not wanting 
to disturb her.  Sitting up to watch the beautiful sunrise, Quistis 
ignored the fact that they would be late getting back to Balamb Garden.  
Let them worry a little.  The two of them needed to get away and be 
alone with their thoughts.  Just then, Quistis heard Rinoa give a long 
sigh as she started to wake up.  Turning around to acknowledge the 
black-haired beauty, she gave her a smile.  &quot;Good morning, Rinoa.  Come 
sit next to me, and watch the sunrise.&quot;  Smiling back, Rinoa crawled to 
Quistis and snuggled up next to her.  Together, they silently looked on 
at the brilliant display of colors and scenery.  

	&quot;It&#39;s amazing.  I&#39;ve never actually took the time to appreciate a 
simple thing like this,&quot;  Quistis murmered.  Rinoa leaned in and gave 
her a kiss on the cheek.  &quot;I know what you mean.  People take little 
things in life for granted.  Um, I wanted to thank you for our talk last 
night, while we were stargazing.  I know we both have feelings for 
Squall, but I don&#39;t want any animosity between us.&quot;  Sitting herself now 
to face Rinoa, she took both the girls&#39; hands in her own.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry 
about it.  To tell you the truth, it feels good to be talking to you.  I 
have something to tell you, that I didn&#39;t want to get out until I could 
confirm my feelings. That&#39;s part of the reason why I asked you to come 
out here with me.  To understand our true feelings.  I do love someone, 
very much.  And she&#39;s sitting across from me.&quot;  Rinoa&#39;s eyes widened, 
and she seemed to be speechless.  &quot;M-me?  I, I don&#39;t know what to say, 
Quistis.  I mean, don&#39;t get me wrong.  You&#39;re a very attractive girl.  
It&#39;s just that, no one&#39;s ever said that to me before. That they love me.  
Do you, really?&quot;

	In response, Quistis leaned in close and kissed Rinoa on the lips.  
She made as if to draw back, but Rinoa pushed her mouth closer and 
returned the kiss.  For a minute they just sat there, eyes shut and 
enjoying the moment.  Then their lips parted and their tongues touched 
each other tenatively at first, then with a slow curling dance.  Quistis 
started to get on her knees, pulling Rinoa along with her, their mouths 
never seperating.  Moving in closer to embrace, Rinoa let her hands run 
up and down Quistis&#39; back, feeling the warmth of her body even through 
her Seed uniform.  Wanting to feel bare skin, she started unbuttoning 
the front of her jacket, then slid it off her.  Quistis opened her eyes 
and broke the kiss.  Giving Rinoa a little grin, she pulled off her 
blouse and tossed it to the side and went to unhook her bra.  Rinoa kept 
herself occupied with undressing, watching Quistis with yearning. When 
they were down to their panties, Quistis lay down on the discarded 
clothing and looked up at Rinoa, beckoning her to crawl on top of her.  
Making her way over, Rinoa rested on her knees over Quistis, and started 
massaging her well-shaped breasts.  She in turn stretched both arms out 
to grope Rinoa&#39;s, rubbing the nipples with her thumbs, feeling them 
harden.  

	Bending over, Rinoa began sucking on Quistis&#39; nipples, first one 
than the other.  One hand she kept for balance;  the other slid its way 
down her stomach to the front of her panties.  Quistis came from a 
different approach, abandoning Rinoa&#39;s breasts and making her way to the 
rear.  Hooking her thumbs under the white cotton band, she slowly slid 
the panties down, leaving her bare ass visible.  Taking ahold of her, 
Quistis squeezed and spread her cheeks apart, then pushed them together 
and repeated.  Rinoa gave a groan and decided to fight back.  Slipping 
her hand down the front of Quistis&#39; panties, she felt warmth and a 
well-trimmed bush.  Probing about with a finger, she found what she was 
looking for and pushed a finger in, making Quistis gasp in pleasure.  
Propping herself onto her elbows, she started gently pushing Rinoa back 
towards the ground.  Willingly complying, she followed Quistis&#39; 
instructions and was soon on her hands and knees, her panties still 
pulled down in the back.  Staring at her luscious ass, Quistis started 
panting slightly and promptly slid her panties all the way off.  Now 
fully nude, she crawled up to Rinoa&#39;s left side.  Settling on her knees, 
the Seed instructor bent over Rinoa&#39;s body and with her right hand 
started rubbing her ass.  Then she gave it several small taps, awaiting 
Rinoa&#39;s reaction.  She seemed to like it, so she resumed, switching 
between the left and right cheek and getting more forceful with each 
spank.

	Rinoa closed her eyes and begged Quistis to continue, feeling 
herself getting more and more aroused with each strike.  When she felt 
it was time for another approach, Quistis stopped spanking and licked 
the middle finger until it was wet.  Then she slid the hand down Rinoa&#39;s 
ass fingers first and used the wet finger to push inbetween her cheeks, 
searching.  Finding what she was looking for, she gently began pushing 
her finger into the anus, glancing at Rinoa&#39;s face for her reaction.  
Eyes widening, Rinoa felt herself being penetrated, and found that she 
liked it.  So Quistis continued until she couldn&#39;t get it in any 
further, then started pushing the finger in and out.  Finding herself 
unable to keep herself supported any longer, Rinoa arms weakened and she 
lowered her front half to the grass. Her lower half was still sticking 
up in the air, her cheeks spreading a little further apart.  Pulling her 
finger free, Quistis got behind Rinoa and got on top, straddling her.  
Grinding her groin into her ass, she made small grunting noises as she 
thrust herself against Rinoa.  Having never felt like this before, the 
slow buildup of energy within Rinoa finally climaxed, and she gave a 
shout of pure ecstacy.  Slowing down and finally stopping, Quistis 
collapsed on the ground.  Shivering with delight and arousal, Rinoa got 
up and stood over her lover.  

	Quistis wondered what the black-haired beauty was going to do 
next.  Smiling down at her, Rinoa removed her panties and stood there in 
full view, the wind starting to pick up and caress her hair.  Now 
shivering from the slight chill, both waited for the other to act first. 
Quistis had a very admirable view of Rinoa&#39;s body, and was attracted to 
her petite yet curvaceous body.  Unlike Quistis, Rinoa fully shaved down 
there, and she was rubbing that area even now, as she started to turn 
around and crouch over Quistis.  Getting down on all fours again, she 
started spreading Quistis&#39; legs apart.  Having full access to her, Rinoa 
bent over and started licking her.  Groaning from the excitement, 
Quistis raised her head and once again spread Rinoa&#39;s cheeks, this time 
to return the favor.  This went on for a good while, with neither one 
wanting to quit.  The sun was now hovering fully over the sky, and both 
girls realized that it was after morning.  They hastily got up and 
dressed, then ran to the groundcar that waited for them at the bottom of 
the hill.  They were very quiet on the trip back, but neither one 
regretted what happened that morning and what it felt like to be loved 
by another.</pre>
