<p align="center">Found</p>
<p>At around 4 in the  morning, Irvine Kinneas was enjoying a wonderful dream of women  surrounding him in an ancient Greek temple, feeding him all sort of  fruits. He most certainly did not wish to have his dream rudely  interrupted by Selphie’s deranged scream of joy. The pitch and tone  was enough to have him jumping off the bed with a small pistol in his  hand. Had it not been for Selphie’s quick movements, he would’ve  shot her as she leapt at him from the computer room and tackled him  to the ground.</p>
<p>“IRVY IT’S  WONDERFUL!” She giggled. Irvine blushed, not used to having Selphie  tackled him while he was dressed in nothing but boxers.</p>
<p>“Wh-what’s  wonderful?” He began to laugh with her, not knowing why. Her mood  was so contagious that he couldn’t help but join in. They laughed  so hard that tears began streaming and by then, Irvine pulled himself  together. “Ok, so tell me, why are we laughing?” She hugged him  tightly.</p>
<p>“I found him.”  Instantly, Irvine stopped being so gleeful and his eyes darkened. <em>Him? </em></p>
<p>“Who’s <em>him</em>?”  He asked.</p>
<p>“You know, the  guy…um…ARIK! Yeah, that’s his name. You know, Quistis’s long  lost love?” Instantly, Irvine relaxed but it didn’t go unnoticed  by Selphie. “Heeeeyyyy…I get it. Were you jealous, Irvy?”</p>
<p>“Nope, I’ve got  you all to myself.” He teased. Selphie got off of him and stood up,  dusting herself off. “So, care to explain what the situation is?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s  nothing concrete but there’s this really old report that I found  and it’s all about how this guy was found in the water at  Fisherman’s Horizon. They took him in and he can’t remember  anything. What they did find was some scraps of paper that clearly  read, ‘Contract for SeeD’ His age, description and everything  fits Instructor Mesh.” She jumped up and down with joy. “We’ve  got to tell Quisty!” She headed for the door but Irvine grabbed her  arm.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a better  idea…”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Quistis awoke first.  She always woke up bright and early to get some training done before  doing whatever it was that needed to be done. So her biological clock  was already set to around 5:00, earlier than most SeeDs and students  who chose for the “late as possible” 6:30. But this time, she  woke up at 6:00. Part of the reason she woke up early was because her  dreams weren’t exactly the most pleasant. But last night…she  drank a little too much. SeeDs are usually tolerant to high levels of  alcohol, but even she could not believe how much she drank. She  looked to the side of her, her heart skipping a beat. Xu was cuddled  in her arms.</p>
<p>She had grown used to  it. It was hard to sleep peacefully without Xu in recent days. But  just seeing her, seeing the reality that was their relationship, it  made her breath freeze in her throat and a warm feeling just spread  to the tips of her toes when she thought about it.</p>
<p>“Mmmm?” Xu  stirred, almost as if sensing Quistis’s thoughts. She opened her  eyes and smiled. “Morning.”</p>
<p>“Morning.” Quistis  replied softly, kissing her forehead.</p>
<p>“I’m getting so  used to this.” Xu said, pulling herself closer. “It’s kinda  scary.”</p>
<p>“What did we do last  night?” Quistis asked. Xu smiled, knowing what she was hinting at.</p>
<p>“We didn’t do  anything, Quistis. After Seifer left, we went to another restaurant  and basically downed a couple of bottles of wine and had dinner.”  She chuckled, her eyes still closed. Quistis was relieved. She was  glad that they didn’t do anything yet. She wanted to be coherent  and conscious when <em>it</em> happened. She blushed, shaking her head  slightly to get rid of the thoughts in her head. It was making her  uncomfortable. Suddenly, someone knocked at the door. Quistis and Xu  both jumped off the bed and Quistis gathered Xu’s jacket and dress,  still in her pajamas.</p>
<p>“I’ll go through  the window!” The brunette said before toppling to the ground. She  was still suffering from some of the aftereffects of being drunk. Xu  began panicking, if someone were to barge in right now, what would  she say? That they were having yet another sleepover? It’s possible  that they’d believe her but it’d still be risky.</p>
<p>“Just relax, Xu.  It’s not like they’re going to immediately assume anything.”  Quisits whispered, touching her shoulder to calm her down. She walked  over to the door and opened it.</p>
<p>“Hey!” Selphie  threw her arms around Quistis, smiling from ear to ear. She spotted  Xu. “Hi…wasn’t expecting.”</p>
<p>“Sleepover!” Xu  blurted. Selphie eyed her warily.</p>
<p>“Riiiiggght.” She  said. “Anyway, Quisty, we were thinking of taking a trip to say,  Fisherman’s Horizon? Nida gave us the ok. We just thought we’d  tour the place a bit.”</p>
<p>“Ok, that’s  fine…but I’m still weak and I have to go back to work tomorrow.”  She said cautiously. Selphie squealed and took hold of her arm.  Quistis looked back at Xu just in time to see her twitch jealously  before regaining composure.</p>
<p>“You’re emotions  are written all over your face.” Quistis whispered with a smile. Xu  shrugged. Selphie dragged her inside. Quistis wondered what the girl  was doing until she started flipping through her closet, taking out  outfits and judging each of them.</p>
<p>“Very nice.” She  commented. “Too bad I’m not as tall as you, otherwise I’d ask  to borrow these.”</p>
<p>“What are you  doing?” The blonde asked. Selphie smiled and then put them back.</p>
<p>“Never mind, you  look fine.” She said before plopping down on the bed and hummed  happily. Xu and Quistis look at each other, knowing something was up  and it was probably something neither of them would’ve liked.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Fisherman’s Horizon  was still as beautiful as ever. The sun was high in the sky and the  air still smelled like salt and fish. It was a wonderful little  sanctuary and Quistis never minded returning to this place for rest  and relaxation. Selphie took hold of her arm again and dragged her  through the streets before she could thoroughly enjoy herself upon  stepping outside. Xu followed, her eyes never leaving the smaller  girl.</p>
<p>Quistis grew curious  when she observed Selphie taking out a piece of paper from her jacket  and looking around for an address. They had walked further than they  had ever walked in the town and the area was quickly growing less  friendly. Fisherman’s Horizon had two sections, the nice cheery one  and the not so nice and cheery one. It was to be expected when  outcasts from everywhere settled. Xu found herself tensing when a  group of rather large males stopped to observe the three of them.</p>
<p>“What’s here  that’s so important?” Quistis asked.</p>
<p>“You’ll see.”  They entered a rather smoky and dark bar. Even meaner looking thugs  played pool in the corner and when they saw the three lovely ladies,  they walked over, smirking.</p>
<p>“So…what’s three  fine looking girls doing around here, eh? Looking for action?” The  one with a red, beer stained shirt said.</p>
<p>“No, we’re looking  for someone cleaner than you.” Selphie retorted. The man was taken  aback.</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“You heard me, go,  shoo!” Selphie said, not making eye contact but instead scanning  the bar. The man cracked his knuckles.</p>
<p>“Listen here you  little.”</p>
<p>“We’re not here to  cause trouble.” Quistis quickly added.</p>
<p>“Hey there fine  thing…what’s that ya got? A whip, hey, we got a dominatrix here,  fellas.” Another one with a crude buzz cut said, putting a hand on  Quistis’s hip. Xu twitched once before swiftly putting herself  between the two.</p>
<p>“Step away.” She  hissed dangerously. The three males chuckled.</p>
<p>“Or what, little  girls? We just wanna treat you to something nice…” The buzz cut  guy drawled. He grabbed Xu’s wrists. By pure SeeD and martial arts  instinct, she kneed him in the stomach. Even though he was obviously  worked out and Xu a much smaller person, the pure accuracy and  concentrated power honed in from her training brought him to his  knees.</p>
<p>“What the-? Little!”  The red shirted man dove for Xu who promptly dodged swept his feet  and when he pitched forward, she brought an elbow down on his head.  The third guy, a head shorter than the others, grabbed her from  behind. She tried to wrestle free.</p>
<p>“Hey, boys, don’t  cause trouble here.” The bartender walked over and clapped a hand  on his shoulder. The man put Xu down, grumbling. The two others got  up and the three stumbled out of the bar.</p>
<p>“We’re sorry.”  Quistis apologized. “We didn’t mean any harm.”</p>
<p>“Nah, it’s ok.”  The bartender said. He had short blond hair, a scar on the edge of  his lip as well as above his eye, probably from previous barfights.  He was a middle aged man who looked nice enough. He was very well  built for a middle aged man. “What can I help you with?” Selphie  smiled.</p>
<p>“We’re looking for  a…Seer?” She said, reading the paper. The bartender blinked in  surprise.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t  happen to know who he is, wouldja?” He asked in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Well, it kinda  depends. Do you know where he is?”</p>
<p>“He’s in the back,  come on, I’ll show ya. Oh, by the way, the name’s Heely.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you,  Heely.” Quistis said politely. He smiled and led them through the  back door. Quistis suddenly noticed something wrong. A young man  wearing a white shirt that was drenched with sweat was lifting boxes  from a ship. His back was facing them. He had brown hair, now matted  against his face.</p>
<p>“Seer! People here  to see you!” Heely yelled. Seer turned around.</p>
<p>Quistis’s heart  stopped. Selphie looked from Seer to Quistis, her smile growing ever  wider. The Instructor started trembling and Xu grasped her hand in  concern. She knew who the man was. The resemblance was uncanny. It  had to be him, it had to be Arik Mesh, the man Quistis…she took a  deep breath and steadied herself. <em>Do what’s best for Quistis…</em></p>
<p>“Arik…” Quistis  whispered. Seer didn’t hear her; instead, he smiled and waved.</p>
<p>“Hi there.”  Quistis turned around and bolted.</p>
<p>“Hey, wait!”  Selphie yelled. She began to take off after her but Xu stopped the  other brunette.</p>
<p>“You’ve done  enough. Stay here.” She snapped, chasing after her girlfriend. It  took a while but with Quistis’s condition, she couldn’t keep  running that long. She turned and sat down on the pier, choking back  her tears. Xu caught up. The brunette sat down beside her and even  though Quistis tried to back away, Xu wrapped her arms around her.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong,  Quis?” She whispered. Quistis buried her face into Xu’s chest and  began crying. A jumble of emotions ran through Quistis’s mind and  she couldn’t help but wonder if her feelings for him were  returning. Why didn’t he contact her? Why did he just leave her all  alone, thinking he was dead? Why did he change his name to Seer? What  was going on? How was Xu going to react? She knew how close the two  of them were years back, what was she going to say?</p>
<p>Xu didn’t say a word  throughout Quistis’s inner turmoil. Instead, she just held onto  her, stroking her strawberry blonde hair and rocking her back and  forth. Behind them, Selphie walked towards them until she spotted the  two. She bit her lip. She had only intended to make Quistis happy. In  a choked voice and faux-clam voice, Xu whispered,</p>
<p>“D-do you still love  him?” Quistis sniffed, trying to compose herself.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Xu,  I really don’t know. I’m scared because I love you more, I know  that. But I don’t know what’s going to happen. There’s so much  I want to ask…there’s so much I don’t understand right now.”</p>
<p>“I love you,  Quistis. Whatever makes you happy, makes me happy.” She said. It  wasn’t true, though. She wanted Quistis all for herself. The  selfish devil in her wanted to go tell Arik to go and jump off a  cliff, to be dead for real. But conscience won and her words showed  it.</p>
<p>“Xu…”</p>
<p>“Just go to him,  figure out what it is you feel for him, if what it is you feel is the  real thing, then…well…go with it.” Every word hurt them both.  Quistis felt like Xu was leaving her alone when she could use someone  the most and Xu felt like every breath she took was distancing her  from Quistis, giving her to Arik.</p>
<p>“Xu…”</p>
<p>“Go…” And the  brunette stood up. Quistis knew her love was only trying to help but  right now it was not what she needed. She needed <em>support</em>,  support only Xu could give. Someone that she had solid, real feelings  for, not just some trace of past emotions. But there she was, heading  back to the Garden. <em>What have I done? </em>Quistis wondered. <em>It  would’ve hurt her so much less if I had just kept up with my  rejection…</em></p>
<p><em>Exactly. You do  nothing but hurt. That’s why you cannot exist.</em> And the voice  was back after so long. So blissfully long and now it returned with a  bitter vengeance like that of an ignored child.</p>
<p><em>Stop it…</em>Quistis  sobbed, feeling powerless.</p>
<p><em>It comes with the  power, Quistis. You inherited Ultimecia’s power, you hold it for  her, and I’m here to tell you that so long as you live, she’ll  rise.</em> Quistis curled up on the pier, sobbing into her knees. Xu  had abandoned her. What did she have left?</p>
