<p align="center">While You  Were Having Fun</p>
<p>Quistis scribbled some  notes on the board, completely oblivious to everything going on  around her. She worried about Xu and the more she thought about it,  the more looking for her seemed like a good idea. <em>No…stop that.  How many times did you go off without telling Xu? She deserves your  trust…</em></p>
<p>“Um…Instructor  Trepe?” She turned around and a boy in the front row, Sy, looked  from her to the board nervously.</p>
<p>“Yes, Mr. Quinn?”</p>
<p>“Um…these were  yesterday’s notes. We’ve already covered this.” Quistis looked  back up at the board and then down at her agenda.</p>
<p>“I don’t think  we’ve covered this.” She said “Yesterday was…”</p>
<p>“Tuesday, Instructor  Trepe…” Quistis looked at the page she was on. It said “Tuesday.”  Today was Wednesday. She sighed heavily.</p>
<p>“My mistake.  Alright, class, today we’ll be learning about multiple Junctions  and which are beneficial and which can be deadly.”</p>
<p>When class was over,  several of the students, notably the Trepies, walked over to her desk  and regarded her with a concerned expression.</p>
<p>“Instructor Trepe?”  She looked up at them, putting on a smiling façade.</p>
<p>“Yes? Is there  something I can help you with?” She asked sweetly.</p>
<p>“Um…” They  fidgeted and Quistis looked at them with sympathy. The newest member  of the Trepies spoke up.</p>
<p>“We were wondering  if there was anything wrong, I mean, not that anything is…I  mean…well…it’s just that you’ve been making so many mistakes  in class, not that you can’t make mistakes…” She stammered.</p>
<p>“We’re just  wondering if everything’s ok and if we could do something to help  out.” Another Trepie, one of the older ones, finished.</p>
<p>“No, everything’s  fine. I apologize for my behavior over the past couple of days but  rest assured, I’ll get my head in gear. Now…aren’t you late for  your next class?” She replied. The Trepies nodded and shuffled out  the door. The newest member of the Trepies, Aina, turned around and  hugged Quistis and then ran off with her face so red, Quistis swore  she felt the heat.</p>
<p>“They’re sweet  kids.” Seifer walked through the door. “Although I think one of  them was about to jump me…”</p>
<p>“What are you doing  here?” Quistis sighed, holding her head. She needed medicine, not a  visit from her least favorite person in the world.</p>
<p>“Just wandering.  There’s only so much you can do being cooped up in the Garden.  D’you know they won’t even let me out of here without all of the  SeeD in this damned place watching ever move I make?”</p>
<p>“I wonder why.”  Quistis responded sarcastically. Seifer sat down on one of the desks  and looked at her with an evil grin.</p>
<p>“I only need one  guess as to what’s bothering you.” Quistis stood up and made a  move to leave the room.</p>
<p>“You need to get her  in your bed.” Quisits turned around.</p>
<p>“What did you say?!”  She demanded.</p>
<p>“I said you need to  get her out of your head.” Seifer repeated. “I know what you’ve  been going through and trust me, I don’t like seeing you like  this.”</p>
<p>“Funny, I don’t  like seeing you at all.” She hissed. Seifer shrugged.</p>
<p>“Just a word of  advice, sex cures all and I’ve got lots of it if you want.” He  winked at her and left. She sighed heavily and gathered up her  papers. As she exited, someone spoke up.</p>
<p>“I can have him shot  on spot, you know. I can do it from a hundred feet away, leave no  evidence.” Quistis jumped and dropped all her stuff.</p>
<p>“Irvine!” She  exclaimed. “You startled me.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“What are you doing  here?” She asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing  suspicious.” Irvine replied. “Just following Seifer around,  making sure he doesn’t get into trouble.”</p>
<p>“Stalking someone <em>is </em>suspicious.” She sighed.</p>
<p>“Not when it’s a  mortal enemy.” He grinned and walked away.</p>
<p>Seifer had his hands  in his pockets without a care in the world. He strolled down the  hallway, eyeing up some of the younger women who looked at him,  recognized him and walked quickly away. He smirked, his eyes roaming  after them.</p>
<p>“Don’t pretend  they’re not cute.” He said. “You and I are the same soul.  You’re a lecher, I’m a lecher, we have same blood.”</p>
<p>“I’d never share  blood with you.” Irvine replied. He stepped out from his hiding  place, realizing he had been seen. Seifer laughed.</p>
<p>“You’re right. I  can get far more women than you can.” Irvine walked up close.</p>
<p>“I don’t trust you  anymore than I want to see you here.”</p>
<p>“Mutual! Good man!”  Seifer clapped Irvine on the back and walked away. Irvine cursed and  shook his head. His eyes wandered outside where snow was slowly  drifting down. He thought of Selphie.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“Hey…big sis?”  One of the younger girls at Trabia tugged at Selphie, who sat alone  at the end of the corridor. A good portion of Trabia had been rebuilt  but many of the main building were mere skeletons of structure.  Selphie turned around.</p>
<p>“What are you doing  here?”</p>
<p>“Could ask you the  same.” The little girl replied.</p>
<p>“Sulking.” Selphie  sighed. The little girl walked up to her and sat down on the floor.</p>
<p>“Is something  wrong?”</p>
<p>“Everything’s  wrong.” Selphie buried her head in her hands.</p>
<p>“Is it a boy?” The  girl asked. Selphie laughed.</p>
<p>“You’re too smart  for your own good.”</p>
<p>“Does he need to be  beaten up? I can do it, you know.” She offered. Selphie looked up  and patted her girl on the head.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about  it. It’s not his fault, it’s mine.” The little girl looked at  her shoes, trying to figure out what was plaguing Selphie’s mind.  As if sensing her distress, Selphie elaborated.</p>
<p>“I like this boy and  I think he likes me too. But he can be such…such an idiot  sometimes. And when he is nice and thoughtful, I get all flustered  and run away. I guess I’m scared which is not acceptable. I mean, I  can go face Behemoths without breaking a sweat but…”</p>
<p>“Sounds like you  really like this ‘boy’.” Selphie’s head jerked around. Rinoa  stood at the other end of the corridor, grinning widely.</p>
<p>“There you are.”  Rinoa remarked.</p>
<p>“Hey…go help the  grownups, ok?” Selphie hissed to the little girl.</p>
<p>“Ok!” The little  girl got up and ran off. Rinoa walked closer to Selphie who turned  bright red.</p>
<p>“How much of that  did you hear?” She asked.</p>
<p>“Come on, Selphie,  take a chance!” Rinoa giggled.</p>
<p>“Easier said than  done.” Selphie groaned. “He tried to kiss me and I ran away! ARGH  I’m so stupid!” Rinoa plopped down on the ground next to her and  patted her arm comfortingly.</p>
<p>“It happens to the  best of us, Seph.”</p>
<p>“I like him, I  really do.”</p>
<p>“Then express it.”  Rinoa pulled two tickets out of her pocket and handed them to  Selphie. Selphie looked at them and her eyes went wide.</p>
<p>“Is this…?”</p>
<p>“You betcha.”</p>
<p>“THE TRABIA SNOW  ANGELS?!” Selphie leapt from her chair.</p>
<p>“Yup. There’s a  concert to boost the morale of everyone working here. It’s  toniiiigghttt.” Rinoa said happily. “You can thank Zell. He knows  one of the people who plays in the band and managed to score tickets  for all of us!” Selphie squealed at the top of her lungs and  wrapped Rinoa into a tight embrace before sprinting outside to find  Zell and strangle him with a bear hug.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Quistis folded her  arms in a way that signaled that her decision would not change. She  wasn’t going to cave into any and every whim that Selphie came up  with.</p>
<p>“But…but…it’s  the Trabia Snow Angels!” Selphie pleaded. “They’re only the  hottest band in the world!”</p>
<p>“Selphie, first off,  I don’t do that pop culture thing as well as you do. Secondly, I  have papers to grade, lesson plans to write and assignments to make.  I don’t have time!”</p>
<p>“You’re going to  kill yourself with all this work!” Selphie whined. Quistis shook  her head.</p>
<p>“I appreciate what  you’re trying to do, I know I need a break but I just don’t have  time for a concert that’s going on all night.”</p>
<p>“Why not just give  the students off? You do realize that most of them are probably  sneaking into the concert and are probably going to be hung over from  all that after party.” Selphie asked.</p>
<p>“If they’re hung  over, that’s not my problem. I’ll have to take the necessary  disciplinary measures but I can’t postpone class for this. The  students are behind already!”</p>
<p>“You’re no fun.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,  Selphie, but work is work.” Quistis stood up and picked up her  tray, deciding that the best way to end the conversation was to  leave. Selphie pouted and crossed her arms.</p>

<p>Xu walked around the  garden, admiring the many different kinds of flora that grew there.  Some of them were widely believed to be extinct and yet they  flourished.</p>
<p>“This garden was in  ruins when I first got here.” Becca explained, following Xu. “The  good doctor didn’t take very good care of it, no time, you see. But  I made time. I thought it would be nice for everyone to have  somewhere to sit and think in quiet while enjoying the beauty of it  all.” Xu touched a small pink flower and instantly it closed up.  She smiled down at it and continued on.</p>
<p>“I’ve always  wanted a garden like this.”</p>
<p>“I remember.”  Becca said fondly. “In fact, part of the reason I built this garden  was because it was something to remember you by.” Xu turned around.</p>
<p>“Did you think I was  dead?” She asked. Becca shrugged.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know  what to think. Shiva took you away and how was I supposed to know if  she found help in time or not?”</p>
<p>“Becca?” They both  looked at the new voice. A tall, skinny, blond haired young man  wearing a loose tie and a white collared shirt walked through the  trees. His breath caught the minute he saw Xu.</p>
<p>“Ah…I’m sure you  remember Andri.” Becca said. Andri opened his mouth to speak but  nothing came out. He couldn’t tear his gaze away from Xu.</p>
<p>“I remember…you  were that quiet book worm! You’re the one who always sat in the  bedroom curled up with whatever reading material you could find!”  Xu replied with a smile. Her eyes darted to the leather bound book in  his hands. “I guess some things don’t change much, do they?”  Becca lifted an eyebrow coyly at Andri’s behavior.</p>
<p>“Andri…say  something.” She suggested.</p>
<p>“I…I…Xu…?”</p>
<p>“Eloquent.” Becca  replied sarcastically.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry…I-I  must be getting back to work.” Andri walked quickly past them and  towards the mansion. The two watched him go and Becca sighed deeply.</p>
<p>“I was afraid of  this.” She said.</p>
<p>“Of what?”</p>
<p>“Please, don’t  tell me you haven’t noticed…? Even when we were all back at the  orphanage, everyone noticed.” Becca replied.</p>
<p>“Tell me!”</p>
<p>“Andri only had eyes  for two things…books and you.” At hearing this, Xu turned bright  red.</p>
<p>“N-no!” She  protested. “Impossible.”</p>
<p>“He’s been  hopelessly in love with you since you were children! The first  question he asked when I went back to get him was ‘Is Xu going to  be there?’ When I told him the situation, he stayed in his room  crying for about a week.” Becca laughed. Xu hid her face and  concentrated hard on the bush in front of her.</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t work  out.”</p>
<p>“You’d be  surprised.” Becca commented. “Things can happen with the most  unexpected of people.”</p>
<p>“They can…can’t  they?” Xu replied, a certain blond invading her thoughts. Becca  noticed the uncomfortable silence and took Xu’s hand.</p>
<p>“Come. You’ve only  seen a little bit of the garden. I’ll show you the rest of it.”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Quistis sat in her  room, all but overwhelmed by the silence. She had finished all her  work and now had nothing to do. She heaved a sigh and went over to  her bed and tried falling asleep. This never happened. Instead she  got up and started pacing up and down the small hallway. She was  about to take sleeping pills and curl up for the night when she heard  something rustle under her door. When she looked closer, it was a  ticket, specifically for the Trabia Snow Angels. Quistis took the  ticket in her hand and turned it over. The show had begun. She sat  down and stared at the ticket, contemplating whether or not she  should go.</p>
<p>“It’ll be good to  take my mind off of things.” She decided and walked out the door.</p>
<p>By the time she got  there, the Snow Angels were close to finishing up. She looked around  for anyone she knew. Squall and Rinoa were sitting closer to the  front. Rinoa had her head on Squall’s shoulder and he had his arm  around her, keeping her warm. Zell and Aya sat on the Garden’s  ledge and when they saw her, they waved. Selphie and Irvine were  sitting, less intimately on a bench further away from the light.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“Selphie?” Irvine  whispered.</p>
<p>“Hm?” Selphie  replied, too engrossed by the music.</p>
<p>“How much to you  like the Trabia Snow Angels?” He asked.</p>
<p>“So much!”</p>
<p>“Would you miss the  end of the concert for anything?” Selphie turned to look at him  quizzically.</p>
<p>“Heck no!” Irvine  smiled.</p>
<p>“Good, then I trust  you won’t run away when I do this.” He leaned forward without any  warning and caught Selphie’s lips in his. Selphie’s eyes widened  and in her head she panicked for a little while until she noticed  that nothing bad was happening. The world wasn’t ending. In fact,  it wasn’t bad at all.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Quistis smiled softly,  mostly out of happiness when she saw the two of them kiss for the  first time but there was a small part of her that hurt. There were so  many couples, she noted, some of them even in her class. And her  lover was far away doing who knew what. She turned to look at Zell  and Aya again. Zell whispered something into a walkie talkie and when  the next song stopped, the lead singer stepped forward.</p>
<p>“Hey, this is a  shout out to the cutest new couple! Selphie and Irvine, where are  ya?” Selphie pulled away from Irvine and stared in shock. “Let’s  hear it for these two lovebirds, eh?” Zell stood up and cheered  first, clapping loudly and howling at the top of his lungs. Irvine,  realizing what Zell did, shook his fist in mock anger. Gradually, the  stadium erupted into cheers and Selphie turned dark red, hiding her  face and leaned against Irvine.</p>
<p>“I’ll get you  back!” Irvine swore but he couldn’t hide a smile.</p>
<p>“I know you owe me!”  Zell shouted, his voice barely audible over the applause. The band  broke into their final song for the night and the commotion died  down. Quistis wiped a tear from her eyes. Everyone was so happy, why  couldn’t she be happy too?</p>
