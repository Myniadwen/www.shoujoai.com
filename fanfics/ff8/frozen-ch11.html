Fujin was ready to go, the sun had set and she was well rested. 
Gathering her newly acquired gear she headed for the door. She stepped 
out into the warm night air, and limped towards the stairs. The moon was 
out in full force and bathed everything in its light. She glanced down 
between the broken steps of the stairs. She was overjoyed at seeing the 
twinkle of metal, the keys where still there. She knelt and recovered 
them eagerly. They where somewhat corroded and she hoped the vehicle she 
was looking for was in better condition. Her ankle still throbbed hotly 
but with her crude crutch it was manageable.

She snagged the empty fuel cell and went to the pumps. She glared at the 
heavy padlocks. Closing her eye she concentrated on a spell. Something 
weak. but strong enough to sunder the lock. She laid a hand on the lock 
and a cloudy black sphere spread around it. It was a struggle to keep 
the spell from getting away from her. She was not very good at magic&#146;s 
hated relying on them. With a dull whine the padlock shuttered and 
started to collapse into itself, finally with a loud pop it imploded 
into nothingness. Fujin breathed a sigh of relief and filled the 
canister with the foul smelling fuel. Finally she was set to go and with 
a slight bit of trepidation set off on her long trek.

By midnight she was getting discouraged, she was making poor time 
despite her best efforts. She kept her mind off the pain in her ankle by 
thinking about the dream she had. It had brought up intense feelings in 
her and she had put off dealing with them until she had time. No time 
like the present she surmised. She remembered the dream all to well. 
Quistis and her acknowledging a love neither had ever hoped to feel. 
Fujin recalled looking up to see her standing over her. How she felt at 
having those enticing sapphire eyes upon her. How open she was, how 
vulnerable. She was desperate for her gentle touch and soothing words. 
She remembered the smell of her when they embraced, feminine, soothing 
and she had to admit arousing. Such alien thoughts she worried, so 
unlike herself. Yet still she knew the dream had a basis of desire if 
nothing else.

&quot;WHY?&quot; She mumbled aloud

&quot;WHY HER?&quot; Voicing her questions only made her more flustered.

She had never felt so drawn to someone except perhaps Seifer. She was 
not sure how to love anyone. She had never let herself try, out for fear 
of rejection. Over the years it quickly made her bitter and spiteful. 
Finally she had long gave up hope for finding anyone.

Now Quistis comes into her life when all others left her. Then let her 
into her life during a obviously hard time. That was brave of her 
especially after all she had done to her, in standing by Seifer.

&quot;Misery loves company.&quot; She thought in jest.

&quot;No there&#146;s something more.&quot; That scared her, she could not deny it, 
could not deny her, as much as she tried.

Those lips, she recalled suddenly, inching closer, whispering to her, 
inviting her. She remembered how she wanted to surrender to them 
completely. To give in to passion, to share herself with someone who 
genuinely cared for her. Was it possible? Could it be so? Dare she even 
try? Was it wrong? She gasped aloud, startled at her thoughts. She 
stopped walking and paused to take a breath. She felt warm and her heart 
beat loudly in her chest. She closed her eyes and shivered at the 
memories. She was not one to be given to fantasies, especially of that 
nature. She was surprised at the intense feelings it stirred within her. 
Confused she bit her lip to force back the foreign thoughts and 
feelings. No one could want or love her and she knew it

&quot;NO!&quot; She yelled at inwardly and forced herself onward. She didn&#146;t know 
what to do anymore. Her thoughts where a confusing jumble of 
contradictions. She was loosing control of everything.

Fujin desperately wanted to believe she was strong and didn&#146;t need 
anyone. But her brief encounters with Quistis reminded her how lonely 
she really was. She was desperate for companionship, for someone to talk 
to, someone to care. She sighed in dismay she felt weak and helpless. 
Quistis tried to reach out to her, to share the pain and hurt. She knew 
it the minute she asked her to dinner. The sad lonely look in her eyes 
mirrored the same feelings she herself had long kept buried. It felt to 
right to be held in her arms, she felt so complete and whole. She was a 
normal woman even if for just a little while. That was her one chance 
and she ran from it plain and simple. She accepted the truth like a 
criminal being executed. She fell to her knees distraught. She sabotaged 
her own chance for happiness for friendship, perhaps even more.

She was no better than Seifer or her brother she realized. Quistis, 
gentle, caring Quistis in the midst of her own turmoil tried to reach 
out. So rather than letting the one person who obviously cared into her 
life, she chose to run.

&quot;COWARD.&quot; She hissed in anger, she punched the ground beneath her 
splitting her already battered knuckles. She didn&#146;t care, it was the 
least she deserved. Quistis was already hurting and her actions most 
likely didn&#146;t help matters. She prayed she didn&#146;t blame herself for her 
own fears and inadequacies.

She stood and let out a tired and battered breath. With half hearted 
effort she trudged on to meet whatever fate had ready for her.

******************************

The calendar was a shoddy little thing with comical pictures of herself 
and the other so called hero&#146;s. Quistis remembered clearly when Laguna 
mailed them out to all of them. Squall nearly fainted when he saw 
himself on the cover, drawn in a style that made him look like a 
cherubic dwarf. Everyone else was also illustrated similarly and shared 
various funny little scenes throughout the book. She looked at her own 
likeness with its huge glasses and mischievous grin. she rolled her eyes 
and marked another black X on the days.

&quot;Three more days.&quot; She mumbled as she grabbed her satchel.

After a quick breakfast and a argument with Xu about her missing work, 
she was on her way to class. Everyone was already there except Luccian 
which she had expected. She eyed the class suspiciously they obviously 
showed up early in case something interesting happened. Aeka smiled at 
her and Rinoa watched her like a worried mother. Quistis faced the chalk 
board not wanting to face them just yet. She scribbled various notations 
about Guardian Forces and thermal reactivity of the Shiva Force in 
particular. The bell rang and she promptly turned around.

&quot;Morning class glad to see you all on time this morning.&quot; She said in a 
sardonic but friendly tone.

&quot;Mornings Miss Trepe.&quot; Everyone said in military union. Quistis nearly 
laughed aloud, something was afoot.

&quot;I was feeling under the weather yesterday I am sorry for any problems 
that occurred. Hopefully Ms. Edea wasn&#146;t to strict on you.&quot;

Everyone shook their heads solemnly.

&quot;I heard about Luccian&#146;s outburst, it&#146;s being taken care of and I don&#146;t 
want anyone to be spreading gossip, okay.&quot; She said with a tone that 
signified she would hear no arguments.

Everyone nodded in acceptance. Quistis put her hand on her hip and 
cocked it to one side in annoyance.

&quot;Okay what&#146;s going on? You guys are acting strange.&quot; She asked dryly.

Rinoa looked around and everyone was staring at her. Aeka nodded and 
gave her a wink.

&quot;Um we where all worried about you Quisty....er Miss Trepe. We just want 
you to know its good to have you back.&quot; Rinoa gave her a hopelessly 
silly and embarrassed grin.

&quot;Thanks Rinoa, all of you. That&#146;s very sweet, really. Still I hope you 
all can refrain from tearing apart the classroom next time I am out.&quot; 
Quistis replied with a sly grin. Several giggles reached her as she 
turned to begin the class.

******************

Trabia garden was still under heavy reconstruction. Classes where being 
held in portable class rooms and what could be salvaged in the main 
structure. Cid had agreed to let more than half the students transfer to 
Balamb in the mean time. Selphie, Irvine and Squall had been helping the 
reconstruction and distribution of supplies it was a lot of work but 
hopes where high. Even Galbania Garden was being refurbished and offered 
some help. Though tensions still ran high between them and the other 
schools. Many lives where lost when the war broke out between the 
gardens and old wounds still bled freely. Edea stood on the balcony 
outside her and Cid&#146;s room watching the work.

She had so much to atone for, so much death had been on her hands. 
Though few blamed her once the truth was reveled. Many though still saw 
her as the face of destruction and misery. So she decided to keep a low 
profile and stay at the garden. She didn&#146;t mind her self imposed house 
arrest a small cost to pay for her transgressions. Innocent or not she 
was to blame for many things.

She thought about the children, those from the orphanage. Seifer, 
Squall, Selphie, Irvine, Fujin, Raijin, Zell, Quistis and Ellone. She 
was lucky they all lived through the war. Though some fared better than 
others. She wished she could had played a bigger part in their growing 
up. Some where so lost now. Seifer like herself, chose to exile himself. 
He had traveled to the island of hell. A horrid deadly place full of the 
deadliest creatures on the planet. She wasn&#146;t to worried though he was 
powerful and deadly in his own right she know he still lived she could 
sense it. She also knew he would someday return and try to make right 
his wrongs. Squall was adapting to his new position of leader of the 
Gardens military side. It kept him busy and gave him purpose, with Rinoa 
at his side she knew he would be fine. The siblings Raijin and Fujin, 
like Seifer where confused and lost still.

Raijin was traveling to come out from under Seifers shadow. She knew he 
was having the time of his life and would probably never return.

The others where fine and well, going on with their relationships and 
finding their niches. Irvine and Selphie had taken to dealing with 
Trabia&#146;s rebuilding and dealing with the junior class. Zell and his lady 
friend where just enjoying the life of young lovers. This left only 
Quistis and Fujin. She loathed to interfere as much as she had already 
but they so desperately needed help. She knew how they felt and what it 
could bring. She sighed as Balamb started to take off, it&#146;s next stop 
was Eshtar. Edea&#146;s heart felt ill a ease, she hoped she made the right 
choices.

********************

Archibald wondered where his friend was, he was getting worried. Luccian 
was always a hot head but here recently he had become downright manic. 
He sat on overlooking the garden committee stage, thrumming his hands 
worriedly. He didn&#146;t know what else to do but try and keep himself out 
of trouble. He wasn&#146;t the smartest bulb in the box and he knew it. 
However he did know right from wrong and here lately he had been feeling 
wrong. He was shocked at how vicious Luccian treated the albino girl. 
Luccian said he only wanted to scare her so he went along with it. He 
never thought he would try and molest the woman. He didn&#146;t know what to 
think of that, luckily she stopped them before he had to make a choice. 
Then he all but threatened Matron Edea.

&quot;Not good.&quot; He mumbled then took a drink from his soda. He was still on 
the Disciplinary Committee but that was no fun without Luccian. Neith, 
Luccian&#146;s replacement was stuffy and boring. He wondered if he should 
just quit. He had no other friend in the Committee, his only other 
friends where in Balamb Guardians ball team. He could try to join them 
again, No he lacked the hand eye coordination for that. He ran a hand 
over the massive expanse of his bald pale head.

He saw Zell bounding up the steps in his general direction. Archibald 
had an idea, He pushed off the wall. He landed with a loud and solid 
thud. Zell screeched to a stop nearly running into him. He staggered 
back from the towering youth before him.

&quot;Gah kid! You scared the hell out of me.&quot; Zell looked up actually 
impressed the boy was nearly seven foot tall and damn near as wide.

&quot;Your Zell?&quot; Archibald asked with a touch of slowness.

&quot;Um.&quot; Zell looked all about then grinned. &quot;Yup says so on my underwear. 
What can I do for ya?&quot;

&quot;You fight right?&quot; Archibald droned.

Zell blinked trying to hide a grin. He was obviously dealing with a 
special lad.

&quot;I&#146;ve been known to pop knuckles on occasion. Why?, Your not here to 
challenge me or nothing are you?&quot;

Zell was never one to back down from a fight, but he was in know mood to 
deal with this junior gorilla.

&quot;You will train me.&quot; Archibald nodded.

&quot;Is that a question?&quot; Zell blinked in shock.

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Not that I have any problem with that...wait. We are talking about 
fighting right.. not...like house training or something.&quot; Zell smirked.

&quot;Funny.&quot;

&quot;Yeah okayyy then. So um what&#146;s your name. I saw you hanging with that 
goon Luccian. Your on the Creep Committee right?&quot;

&quot;Names Archibald and I used to be on the Committee but I quit.&quot;

&quot;When?&quot;

&quot;Now.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough. What about your friend.&quot;

&quot;What about him.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t want him coming about starting trouble with the students in my 
dojo.&quot;

&quot;Not a problem.&quot;

&quot;That goes for you too big guy.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t start trouble.&quot;

&quot;Uh Huh. Been there said that.&quot; Zell grinned and clapped the him on the 
arm. Archibald grinned huge and horrid grin.

&quot;Ehh.&quot; Zell blanched and winced at the enormous yellow maw. &quot;Well see 
you after classes around five then.&quot;

&quot;Not problem.&quot; Archibald nodded.

&quot;Well I have to run, So see ya then.&quot; Zell said with a nod before 
jogging off.

Archibald watched him go, then lumbered back to his wall.

He would wait for his friend and hope.

*********************

Rinoa and Selphie paced around absently. Their footsteps sounding 
audibly on the recently completed the Garden Committee&#146;s stage. They had 
been trying for more than an hour to plan Quistis&#146;s birthday party. 
Rinoa spun to face her friend and shoute.

&quot;I have it!&quot;

Selphie regarded her suspiciously.

&quot;I hope so, cause with me being so busy in Trabia I&#146;ve had no time to 
think of anything.&quot;

&quot;First we take her out, spoil her shopping at the Lockhart&#146;s Boutique. 
Their main store is Eshtar, right? Anyway after that we get her a 
makeover, that always cheers me up. Then we surprise her with a blind 
date with, someone hunky that I know she will like. Then we set up 
arrangements at the best shows the town has to offer. Finally we have a 
blowout surprise party at the banquet hall when she returns.

Selphie wasn&#146;t impressed in the least. She regarded Rinoa with a 
contemptuous smirk.

&quot;What!?&quot; Rinoa scowled cutely.

Selphie cleared her throat and sighed, she walked forward gesturing 
broadly with her hands.

&quot;Cute, real cute buuuut. First we already went shopping, kinda lame to 
do it all over again so soon.

Secondly the makeover idea could be good or bad. I mean, really, she 
could easily take that as a insult.&quot;

&quot;But.&quot; Rinoa Sulked, eyeing her dubiously.

&quot;Now, now don&#146;t pout hon. I have been throwing parties for years. Now 
then, lets see what else we have. Oh yes the blind date, ugh.&quot; Selphie 
cringed. &quot;Do you remember that creepy guy, I think his name was Snake.&quot; 
She rolled her eyes. &quot;Ya know, the older fella with the mullet and 
smoking habit. Quisty about had a fit.&quot;

&quot;He was cute!&quot; Rinoa whined, insulted.

&quot;Yeah for her dad perhaps, the guy was like forty.&quot; Selphie laughed 
aloud.

&quot;That&#146;s not fair, Zell said he was cool, I only wanted to help.&quot; Rinoa 
frowned.

&quot;Fine how about that other guy you tried to hook her up with?&quot;

&quot;Who? Stiener?&quot;

Selphie exploded into laughter. Rinoa folded her arms and huffed.

&quot;Okay I admit that guy was a bit of a crank.&quot; She confessed.

&quot;Yeah a old crank.&quot;

&quot;He was so sweet and shy.&quot;

&quot;Fat old guy.&quot; Selphie snickered.

&quot;Be nice.&quot;

&quot;Rinoa you have horrid taste in men.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot;

&quot;Calm down Squall&#146;s not included, ya scored big there.&quot;

&quot;I never saw you do better.&quot; Rinoa pointed accusingly. &quot;That loony with 
the spiked blonde hair.&quot;

Selphie dismissed her with a wave.

&quot;That guy doesn&#146;t count.&quot; She sniggered

&quot;Always going on about spirits and streams.&quot; Rinoa smirked derisively. 
&quot;A religious nut in every sense of the word.&quot;

&quot;Okay, Okay this is getting us no where.&quot; Selphie sat down on the edge 
of the stage, Rinoa joined her.

&quot;We should at least try something Selph.&quot;

&quot;Who though is the problem.&quot;

&quot;Aw I have no idea.&quot; Selphie ran her head through her hair aggravated.

&quot;I could ask Squall.&quot; Rinoa shrugged.

Selphie looked at her baffled

&quot;What!?&quot; Rinoa balked. &quot;It&#146;s not like he&#146;d do anything with her.&quot;

&quot;Why don&#146;t ya rub her face in it.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#146;t mean it like that. Just a friendly....&quot; Rinoa tried weakly.

&quot;Your reaching hon, that&#146;s a bad idea on so many levels.&quot;

&quot;Your right I guess.&quot; Rinoa slumped.

&quot;Oh yes I am.&quot; Selphie nodded with much sincerity.

&quot;Hey I am trying here at least. She&#146;s been weird lately, I never know 
how she will react to anything.&quot; Rinoa grumbled and huffed.

&quot;Yeah I know, she&#146;s just trying to sort things out.&quot; Selphie slipped a 
pack of gum from her pocket. She offered her companion a piece before 
taking one herself. Rinoa take it absently, lost in thought.

&quot;I wish she would talk to us.&quot; She whispered.

&quot;I know, she just needs time I guess.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m worried about her, I think we should watch her.&quot; Rinoa said 
dangerously.

&quot;Oh Hyne, don&#146;t think that way.&quot; Selphie looked her frightened.

&quot;What if she tries to hurt herself.&quot;

&quot;Surely not.&quot; Selphie shivered at the thought. She had lost to many 
close friends when Trabia was destroyed. She felt fearful tears welling 
up. Rinoa glanced at her and regretted her words.

&quot;Your right hon, Quisty&#146;s just in a slump. I know what we can do now. 
We&#146;ll just surround her with those who love her and have a helluva 
party. Hopefully we can cheer her up and make her forget her worries.&quot;

&quot;I hope so.&quot; Selphie murmured.

******************

It was early morning and the sun was up. She wore her dress coat to 
protect her from the sun, but the heat was stifling. Better than burning 
again she mused. She was going through water quickly though and it would 
only get worse when it became noon. She hated being maimed, her ankle 
still screamed at her in outrage. She should have been in Eshtar by now, 
but instead she would likely die. She hissed in defiance and pushed 
onward, she squinted as something caught her eye. A large gray object 
was settled on the tracks ahead. She hobbled quickly towards it, hope 
twinkling in her chest.

It was a hover car of some sort. It&#146;s blue paint was, pitted and 
corroded by salt water and sun. It was half on and half off the bridge, 
teetering slowly in the wind. She cursed her luck and moved to inspect 
it. Once satisfied it was not going over the edge she went to check the 
engine. She fiddled with the hood a moment before it popped up. She 
leaned over and poked about. The hoses where mostly intact some had been 
partially dry rotted, the engine itself had rust spots but seemed 
functional. Slipping the fuel container from her shoulder, she went to 
back of the vehicle. Finding the fuel tank, She carefully poured in the 
fuel mixture. Satisfied she went to the drivers side and pulled the door 
handle. It rattled loosely in her hand and did not open. Annoyed she 
tried the other doors and found them locked. She was loath to try the 
keys for fear of getting them stuck or broke in the rusty locks. She 
scowled a moment before abruptly shattering the passenger window with 
her elbow. The satiety glass exploded inward, the tiny shards biting 
into the flesh up and down her arm. She wrestled with the lock a few 
moment before it finally surrendered She yanked the door open and 
wiggled into the drivers seat. She pulled the keys from her pocket then 
paused.

She looked up and closed her eye. Not particularly religious, she non 
the less felt the need to pray.

&quot;HYNE.&quot; She pleaded gruffly and inserted the key, it took a bit of work 
but it turned. The vehicle belched loudly and shook. Fujin winced at the 
sound, then it backfired loudly nearly scaring her senseless. She turned 
it off then tried once more, this time the craft sputtered and coughed 
like a dying thing. She examined the controls a moment trying to make 
sense of them. She had flown a craft similar to this one before during 
training. She increased the throttle causing the thing to backfire 
again, it then calmed and began to hum haphazardly. She took the wheel 
and pulled gently on it. She felt the craft rise slowly into the air, it 
swayed back and forth unsteadily. She nearly yelled in glee. She pressed 
the throttle forward and the craft moved slowly but surely. The interior 
smelled of old leather and salted fish. She looked around for something 
identifying it&#146;s hapless owner. Not finding anything at a glance, she 
headed off back towards the way station to refuel. </pre>
