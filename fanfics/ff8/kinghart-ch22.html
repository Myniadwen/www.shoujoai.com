<p align="center">A Taste of  What is to Come</p>
<p>Adel woke up from her  sleep and looked around. She had felt something…a spike in power  that was in no way normal. She got out of bed and walked out to the  beach. Even if she had been evil, it was as if being reborn had also  cleansed her soul. She felt more at peace with the world, even  knowing that if people found out who she was there would be no place  for her to stay.</p>
<p>“No place but here.”  She whispered. She looked up at the bright moon, a strong smell of  ocean wafting about her nose. It was cool and natural, unlike the hot  sun and artificial smells of Esthar.</p>
<p>“Adel?” Edea  called, walking down the steps.</p>
<p>“Oh, Matron.” She  hesitated, unaware that the name came naturally. She wondered why she  didn’t call the former sorceress Edea. She was, in a round about  way, older than Edea after all. Edea on the other hand didn’t seem  to take notice.</p>
<p>“What are you doing  up so late?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.” Adel  lied. “I couldn’t sleep. I suppose I’m still not used to the  time change from here to Esthar.”</p>
<p>“Is that were you  stayed?” Edea asked.</p>
<p>“After my defeat at  the Lunatic Pandora, I woke up in this form. After some confusion, I  realized that there was no possible way I could die. I had no one  around to transfer my powers to so I was reincarnated. I wandered  around, fighting off monsters before I reached Esthar. I couldn’t  very well tell people who I was; they’d lock me in that chamber  again. I figured the best course of action was to seek someone who  knew my predicament better, hence I wandered to the Garden.”</p>
<p>“You poor thing…it  must’ve been hard.” Edea said sympathetically.</p>
<p>“Don’t talk down  to me like I’m some kind of puppy.” Adel snapped, growing cross  with the unfamiliar show of affection. She crossed her arms. “I  didn’t ask to be in this body.” Edea tried hard to keep a smile  off her face.</p>
<p>“I apologize.” She  replied quietly. “Now, come along. The only way to get used to the  change in time is to sleep when others sleep.” Adel took one glance  over the wide expanse of ocean, thinking about the power surge and  then followed the Matron back inside.</p>

<p>“Group A, are you in  position?” Squall asked through his communication device.</p>
<p>“Group A, in  position. Everything appears clear, no sign of anything…” Quistis  trailed off. “Actually, something has been bothering me. We haven’t  run into a single monster or living creature since we began  patrolling.”</p>
<p>“They must’ve been  scared off by the noise. Alright, you keep patrolling, make sure no  one goes out and no one gets in. We’ll head for the center now.”</p>
<p>“Roger that.”  Quistis replied. Squall drew his gunblade and nodded to the others.</p>
<p>“You ready?” He  asked.</p>
<p>“You bet!” Zell  said, pounding his fist against his hand. Rinoa nodded, checking her  pinwheel.</p>
<p>“Alright, Group B,  head out!” The three of them charged into the town. When they  entered, everything was quiet save for the faint crackle of fire. The  shop at the edge of town had burned. Squall looked solemnly. A burned  corpse lay inside the shop, one of probably many casualties.</p>
<p>“Any survivors?”  Rinoa asked tentatively. Zell peeked into all of the burned buildings  a look of horror spread on his face.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t look like  it.” He replied.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep going,  there may still be time to save the people inside. I don’t see  smoke at the center of town yet.” Squall said and they began  running down the dirt path. As soon as they hit the bridge, they  found someone still breathing.</p>
<p>“What happened  here?” Zell asked as Squall knelt down to inspect his wounds. <em>Fatal…</em>he thought. <em>He probably won’t make it.</em></p>
<p>“We…everything  was…just like normal. Then…the young man from the shop  just…just…” The man coughed once more and went limp. Rinoa  covered her mouth and Squall shook his head.</p>
<p>“A young man from  the shop?” Zell repeated. “So…it wasn’t an outsider.”  Something from inside the large mansion drew their attention. It was  a loud crashing noise, as if something large, glass and metal had  fallen from a high place.</p>
<p>“Group A, Group A,  can you read me?”</p>
<p>“We read you.”  Quistis replied through the comm.</p>
<p>“We’ve just  detected something suspicious. Rendezvous at the bridge immediately.”  Squall ordered.</p>
<p>“Roger that.”  Quistis said. She turned to Irvine and Selphie, who were still  looking around for anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>“We’ve just gotten  orders to meet them. Come on!” She said and the three of them began  sprinting towards the center. When they got there, Squall and the  others had secured the opening to the mansion.</p>
<p>“We’re going in.”  He said and kicked open the door. All was quiet besides the loud  banging of the door hitting the wall. The group peered inside, slowly  and cautiously making their way in. The loud crashing had apparently  come from the chandelier which lay on the ground.</p>
<p>“Hyne!” Selphie  shrieked, pointing to the wall next to them. There lay in a bloody  and charred heap, one of the SeeDs. His body lay in a crumpled and  broken way. Blood ran from his eyes and head, almost obscuring his  features. One of his arms was hanging, half off and in that hand was  the communicator used to contact the Garden.</p>
<p>“Jeez…” Irvine  hissed, kneeling to inspect him. “What in Hell could’ve done  this?”</p>
<p>“We met a dying man  out there. He gave us a few clues. Apparently, the suspect is one of  the villagers, a young man from the shop. But that’s all we know.  We don’t know what he is exactly, or what he’s doing but it’s  obvious that it came on suddenly.” Squall explained. A soft thud  came from the upstairs bedroom and all six of them turned their heads  to look. Squall motioned for them to stay ready and follow him. They  made their way quietly up the steps and when they neared, they began  to hear voices.</p>
<p>“No…no…no…”  Someone muttered. “Nothing here is of any use to me. I need to know  who they are. Don’t you agree, Napee?” Squall recognized the  name. Napee was a SeeD two years his senior. Was she still alive?</p>
<p>“BAH!” The voice  continued. “Nothing here is of any use to me.” Squall motioned  for them to charge the door and he kicked the door open again and the  six poured in.</p>
<p>A young man, dressed  in white and gold clothing stood at the bookshelf, pulling books down  in frustration. He appeared to be looking for something. When he  heard the six of them, he turned around, an old dictionary in hand.</p>
<p>“Don’t move.”  Squall threatened but the young man moved anyway.</p>
<p>“Ah, more Garden  lackeys. Don’t you ever get tired of rushing in like this? I’m  trying to find something that will aid me in my quest.” He said  calmly. Quistis tightened her grip on her whip. Squall glanced over  at the bed where Napee lay. She was in cleaner condition than the  corpse downstairs but her eyes were wide and lifeless nonetheless.  Two other bodies lay on one side, one piled on the other and they too  wore the SeeD uniforms.</p>
<p>“They’re all  dead…” Zell whispered.</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry about  that. They were getting in my way. I lost control of my power when I  accidentally burned down those building. I lost control of myself too  for a while…which is why Cednar back there is in a bit more of a  mess. I was going to let these three go but they insisted on getting  in my way. I tried to explain that I didn’t mean to kill him  but…well…I suppose you SeeD are proud creatures, eager to avenge  your comrades’ death and whatnot. Pity…I actually liked Napee a  little.” He sighed and threw the dictionary aside.</p>
<p>“Who do you work  for?” Squall demanded.</p>
<p>“Work for? I work  for myself. No one controls me, after all, how could they? I am Hyne  after all.” The room went deathly silent. Zell had an urge to laugh  at him.</p>
<p>“Hyne?” He  repeated. “You?”</p>
<p>“Zell…” Squall warned.</p>
<p>“You are nowhere  near Hyne.” The martial artist spat. “You’re a mental case!”  The man narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>“Really, how  disrespectful of you.” He hissed. “You are a rude little  creature.” He raised up both hands and lifted Zell of the ground,  flipping him backwards into the wall.</p>
<p>“Zell!” Selphie  shouted. Squall charged with his gunblade but the man deflected it  with his hand.</p>
<p>“Would any normal  human have this kind of power? I <em>am </em>Hyne!” He shoved Squall  through the window down onto the concrete below.</p>
<p>“SQUALL!” Rinoa  shouted and ran over to the broken window, peering down at him. He  got to his feet.</p>
<p>“I’m ok.” He  hissed. Hyne suddenly jerked his head towards Rinoa, seemingly  transfixed by her. His eyes narrowed questioningly before they glowed  red with anger.</p>
<p>“So…the sorceress  finally rears her head. I was wondering when you would waltz right  into my hands. It was fate that I landed here.” Selphie looked from  “Hyne” to Rinoa and quickly put herself in between them.</p>
<p>“Don’t you touch  her!” She snapped. “Hyne” made a disgusted hiss and blasted her  backwards onto the bed. He took a step towards her and Rinoa readied  herself for combat. Irvine shot at him but the bullets merely  deflected off of some invisible barrier.</p>
<p>“I suppose you had  to come out of hiding sometime.” He sneered.</p>
<p>“What do you want?”  Rinoa demanded. He took another step.</p>
<p>“Really, I wonder  why the SeeD are working with you when they should be destroying you,  like I will in but a moment. You’ve grown careless, Edea.”  Quistis’s eyes widened in confusion.</p>
<p>“Edea?”</p>
<p>“You stupid fools.  Did you not know that she was a sorceress? Edea! Edea Kramer. Only  Edea Kramer has that aura. I suppose you SeeD are worthless after all  when you can’t even sense a sorceress that’s been traveling with  you!” He shouted, not taking his eyes off of Rinoa. Zell charged  forward and punched right through the barrier and landed a good blow  to Hyne. Unfortunately, Hyne grabbed Zell’s fist and threw him out  the window as well. Irvine stood with his pulse bullet ready. But  before he could even fire, Hyne bent the barrel of his gun, yanked  Irvine with his mental energy and flung him onto the bed along with  Selphie.</p>
<p>“I’ve waited a  long time to stop you.” He said moving ever closer to her. Rinoa  summoned all of the magic within her and cast her strongest spells.  Hyne was momentarily surrounded by flames before a simple wave of the  hand extinguished them.</p>
<p>“Powerful. I believe  you scorched me. But no matter.” Quistis decided it was her turn to  act. With one quick lash of her whip, she caught Hyne’s arm…along  with his attention.</p>
<p>“I believe each and  every one of you has a death wish.” He said calmly, turning to her.  He stopped and his mouth hung open.</p>
<p>“I have no death  wish. I’ve got a promise to keep.” Quistis snapped. Hyne turned  his entire body towards her, completely forgetting about Rinoa.</p>
<p>“Two…two  sorceresses have wandered into my hands. Edea Kramer and Ultimecia.”  He laughed. “This is perfect!” Quistis released him, only to  strike again, cutting open his shoulder.</p>
<p>“I am not  Ultimecia!” She yelled, casting dispel. Instantly, Hyne’s  barriers were broken down but Hyne didn’t care. He seized Quistis  with his right hand and charged a spell with his other.</p>
<p>“Once I get rid of  you, Edea and Adel will be mere ants under my foot.” Quistis felt  the breath being choked out of her as she gasped for air. <em>Xu…</em>she  thought. He brought the spell close to Quistis’s neck and  detonated. The Instructor went limp in his hands but just to be sure,  he charged another spell. Suddenly, something sharp cut into his  side. With his barrier down, Rinoa had fired her pinwheel and  succeeded in hitting him. He dropped Quistis, clothes and neck  charred onto the ground.</p>
<p>“If you must die  now, I suppose I can arrange for that.” He snapped but before he  could take one step, Zell stormed up the stairs and hit the back of  his head with enough force to break open his skull.</p>
<p>“He’s all yours,  Squall!” Squall followed up Zell’s attack by stabbing him in the  back and twisting his gunblade to cause as much damage as possible.  “Hyne” coughed once and blood burst forth from his mouth, a  direct result of the wound and collapsed. Rinoa rushed over to  Quistis and put her ear to her heart.</p>
<p>“Ok…no big deal…”  She said trying not to panic and cast Life. It was a moment before  Quistis coughed and opened her eyes.</p>
<p>“Thank goodness.”  Selphie sighed even though her body was in considerable pain as well.  Irvine looked at his gun.</p>
<p>“My baby…” He  sniffed. “How could he…?” Squall kicked the body onto its back  and stared down. He contacted Nida on his comm.</p>
<p>“Nida, send in the  recovery unit, make sure they find and treat all survivors.” He  ordered.</p>
<p>“Roger that.” Nida  said.</p>
<p>“Our work is done.  The suspect has been neutralized.” Squall announced. “Let’s let  the recovery unit do their job.” He sheathed his sword and walked  out of the room, followed by Selphie and Quistis who were supporting  each other.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t so  bad.” Zell said, casting a small cure on his bruises.</p>
<p>“Speak for  yourself.” Irvine muttered. “If Quistis hadn’t broken his  barrier…hey…speaking of Quistis and Rinoa, why did he call you  two Ultimecia and Edea?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”  Quistis responded. &quot;Right now we’re too excited to think. Let’s  just get back to the Balamb before we start analyzing anything.”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>In the conference  room, they discussed the matter. But their theories and explanations  were nothing short of impossible until Rinoa chipped in her theory.</p>
<p>“Well…he said that  only Edea had that aura, right? Maybe…maybe he doesn’t know what  Edea actually looks like. Maybe he just senses the sorceress power  within Quistis and me and thinks that we’re Edea and Ultimecia.”</p>
<p>“But if that’s the  case,” Selphie cut in, “Edea wasn’t the first sorceress. If  this guy made judgments based on power, then wouldn’t he call you  the very first sorceresses? The ones who started out with your  powers?” The room went silent, contemplating.</p>
<p>“One thing is for  sure, he’s not the real Hyne.” Quistis said. “And since he’s  not the real Hyne, maybe he doesn’t know any Sorceresses besides  Edea, Adel and Ultimecia. Winhill isn’t exactly your place for  recent news. Maybe he didn’t know that Edea and Ultimecia’s  powers had been passed on.”</p>
<p>“That still doesn’t  explain just where he came from.” Irvine noted. “I mean, this guy  was on the low for how many years? And just one day he decided to  emerge and destroy everything?” Nida suddenly stepped into the  room.</p>
<p>“Squall, there’s  something you might need to hear.” He said.</p>
<p>“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“This guy…he was a  SeeD at the Galbadia Garden. His name is Ocelot Zeek, SeeD rank 14.  He went missing about ten years ago on a mission to Deling to subdue  the Galbadia army’s uprising.” The room went quiet again, this  time from shock.</p>
<p>“The GF’s…?”  Selphie whispered, trying explain how he disappeared and why he had no memory.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”  Squall replied. “Look, we’ve tried to make sense out of this but  it’s obviously not working. Let’s all just get some sleep and try  not to wear ourselves out. Dismissed.” One by one, they filed out,  exhausted and sore from their battle. Quistis didn’t want to sleep  though, she wanted to see Xu.</p>
<p>When she arrive  outside her door and knocked, Xu opened the door and sighed in  relief.</p>
<p>“You’re ok…”  She was cut short when Quistis pressed her lips to hers suddenly and  unexpectedly, causing her to take a few steps back. “Quistis…?”  She mumbled through the kiss. Quistis didn’t respond. Instead, she  gently pushed Xu back further into the bedroom, not wanting to speak  for fear that if she did, all her worries about the mission would  come tumbling out of her mouth and ruin their moment.</p>
