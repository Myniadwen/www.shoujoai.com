Irvine turned and looked when everyone grew silent. Zell had the sudden 
need to be elsewhere, having no desire to get assaulted again. He 
quickly left to find somewhere to watch the inevitable fireworks.

&quot;Hi guy.&quot; Selphie said sheepishly to Irvine.

&quot;Lordy this is going to be interesting.&quot; Celest said folding her arms.

&quot;Hey, I apologized so get over it!&quot; Selphie snapped.

&quot;Girls please..&quot; Nicole pleaded; hoping to defuse the situation before 
it got out of hand.

&quot;Nicole&#39;s right let&#39;s try to be adults here.&quot;

&quot;Adults, she&#39;s the one....&quot; Celest started but Irvine cut her off.

&quot;Hey trouble how ya doin.&quot; He said softly, looking at Selphie with a 
weary expression.

&quot;I guess I&#39;m okay, but I&#39;d be better with you.&quot; She whimpered

&quot;Awwwww.&quot; Rinoa and Nicole cooed bubbly with stars in their eyes.

&quot;Not that it&#39;s any of my business but I think it&#39;d be a mistake to 
forgive her so soon bro.&quot; Celest said with a huff.

&quot;You&#39;re right it is none of your business you over-inflated hussy!&quot; 
Selphie spat sharply.

&quot;You little bitch!&quot; Celest said, gawking in shock.

&quot;Oh here we go.&quot; Zell said from the safety of the kitchen, having 
decided he&#39;d have a better chance socializing with Squall and Fujin than 
to deal with than another catfight.

Chaos promptly ensued as Celest and Selphie exploded into a furious ball 
of hair pulling and cursing so vile it would have made Seifer blush. The 
battle inadvertently engulfed Nicole and Rinoa who foolishly tried to 
intervene.

&quot;Oh for the love of Hyne!&quot; Quistis yelled furiously as Irvine tried help 
stop the melee for his effort he was rewarded with a firm kick in the 
head by Rinoa who was trying to push herself free from the tussle. He 
staggered backward holding his nose and flipped over the couch taking it 
with him.

&quot;Damn it, break this up right now!&quot; Quistis screamed as the entangled 
mass of spitting fury jostled her entertainment center, sending photos 
everywhere.

Squall barreled out of the kitchen to see what the racket was. Fujin 
sighed and looked to Zell who was busily choking down the remains of 
Quistis&#39;s dinner.

&quot;Wmuat?&quot; He asked with a mouthful of foulness.

&quot;GOING TOO?&quot; She asked simply.

&quot;Mell fno, ni&#39;m fnot nrazy.&quot; He cackled.

&quot;DISGUSTING.&quot; Fujin said with the token bluntness, only she could manage

Zell gulped down the food he was mangling and smiled.

&quot;I did it last time you go.&quot; He said with a shrug.

She handed her plate to him with a firm shove.

&quot;Hey cool thanks, more for me!&quot; He hopped up on the counter to enjoy his 
feast as she walked into the living room.

Thing where calming down somewhat as she walked up, the fighting having 
be downgraded to relentless shouting and jostling. Irvine had a kicking 
and screaming Celest tossed over his shoulder, as he yelled at Selphie 
who was firmly pinned to the ground by Rinoa and a very irked Nicole, 
who now sported a lovely purple bruise along her jaw.

Squall was restraining Quistis, who had her glasses broken in the fray 
and was now looked ready to kill every living being in the room. Chaos 
reigned supreme and it was giving Fujin a glorious headache.

&quot;ALL OF YOU GET THE HELL OUT OF MY APARTMENT!!&quot; Quistis screamed in 
growing fury.

&quot;Squall do something!&quot; Rinoa yelled as Selphie tried in vain to wiggle 
free.

Fujin came up behind and tapped Squall on the shoulder. He looked in 
relief she nodded to the struggling Quistis. Fujin smirked slightly as 
he shoved the struggling woman at her. Fujin wrapped her firmly in her 
arms not letting her go. Quistis not realizing who had her started to 
throw a holy fit. Fujin looked up and sighed then leaned to blow gently 
in her ear while everyone was distracted.

&quot;WHAT THE HELL....&quot; Quistis started before realizing who had her then 
quieted immediately. With a sigh she let herself rest back against Fujin 
who stood stoically holding her.

&quot;They tore my apartment up.&quot; Quistis pouted.

&quot;KILL THEM?&quot; Fujin asked dryly, while watching Squall speaking to the 
embattled group, his voice a foreboding whisper.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Quistis pouted.

Fujin let her go and moved forward threateningly.

&quot;Hyne!? Fu wait.&quot; Quistis balked and grabbed her arm. &quot;That was a 
joke...&quot;

Fujin arched a brow at her and chuckled.

&quot;Brat..&quot; Quistis whispered through squinted eyes.

Zell finally showed his face and walked up munching on a bag of chips 
and toting a 2-liter of soda.

&quot;So things calmed down?&quot;

&quot;Zell...&quot; Quistis said softly, her voice quivered in growing anger. &quot;You 
mind..NOT..eating everything out of my kitchen..&quot;

&quot;Oh Miss Trepe...I&#39;m sorry, really...&quot; Zell coughed sending out a cloud 
of chip dust.

&quot;Hyne Nikki!&quot; He shouted in shock upon seeing the bruise Nicole now 
sported.

&quot;Where were you?&quot; Nicole said accusingly.

&quot;Hey now I was in the kitchen.&quot; Zell had a feeling he&#39;d have no hope in 
keeping out of things now.

&quot;JUVENILE.&quot; Fujin said with a scowl, not that she cared. She was more 
annoyed with the blatant disrespect everyone was showing Quistis and her 
home.

&quot;No one asked for your opinion.&quot; Selphie said snidely. &quot;What are you 
doing here anyway, no one likes you. Squall and Cid only let you come 
back because they felt sorry for you. You moody inconsiderate freak!&quot;

Fujin didn&#39;t move at all except to grab Quistis by her belt when she 
started forward.

&quot;Get her!&quot; Celest shouted encouragingly.

&quot;DAMN IT, ALL OF YOU SHUT UP!&quot; Squall shouted, causing everyone to look 
at him startled. Selphie burst into tears, as did Nicole.

&quot;Now see what you did, you&#39;re not helping.&quot; Rinoa said accusingly to 
Fujin.

&quot;That means you too Rinoa.&quot; Squall said sourly as he started pacing. 
Rinoa nearly fell over in shock.

&quot;This sucks.&quot; Zell mumbled.

&quot;We&#39;ll I didn&#39;t see you helping out.&quot; Nicole whispered at him harshly.

&quot;Awww that&#146;s not fair!&quot;

&quot;Zell, stop with the whining please....&quot; Irvine groaned rubbing his 
temples.

Squall&#39;s eyes darkened and he spun on them.

&quot;Next one of you that opens your mouth is getting demoted and if anyone 
so much as lays a finger on the other you&#39;ll be spending the next week 
in the detention center.&quot;

Rinoa opened her mouth to speak and Squall looked at her sternly, she 
shut her mouth with a huff and pouted angrily.

Fujin moved behind Quistis and whispered in her ear, letting her breath 
tickle her teasingly. Quistis closed her eyes and shivered slightly. No 
one noticed as they left.

Quistis quietly followed Fujin up the darkened halls, it was late now 
and nearly everyone was asleep. They could still hear the arguing coming 
from her apartment but both women had ceased caring. Quistis was more 
concerned with what her mysterious companion was up to.

&quot;Where are going?&quot; She whispered curiously Fujin neither answered nor 
turned to face her.

&quot;Fu?&quot; She tried again, this time getting a response. Fujin stopped and 
turned, her features lost in shadows cast by her hair, gracefully 
stepping forward she kissed her softly. Quistis, though surprised, 
returned the kiss and pressed closer. Fujin broke away and placed a 
gentle finger to her lips as Quistis started to speak. Taking her by the 
hand Fujin bid her to follow. They soon arrived at the elevator and 
wordlessly they stepped inside, Quistis watching curiously as Fujin used 
her key to unlock the way to her quarters. As the elevator started its 
descent, Fujin leaned against the back wall with a sigh and looked down 
at her feet.

&quot;What are you doing.&quot; She screamed inwardly, her expression one of 
worry. Quistis tilted her head to regard her curiously and touched her 
shoulder.

&quot;Something troubling you hon?&quot; She asked delicately, sensing the growing 
apprehension in her. Shaking her head Fujin rubbed her eye 
self-consciously. The elevator stopped and the door opened with a soft 
ding causing Fujin to look up startled before gazing at her worried 
companion. They gazed at each other for a seemingly long moment, 
studying each with an unspoken intensity. The elevator dinged once more 
as the doors started to close, snapping the two back to reality.

&quot;Oh!&quot; Quistis giggled and rushed forward to stop it. Fujin gasped softly 
and blinked as she struggled through the thoughts racing through her 
mind. Taking a breath she ran tense hand through her hair as Quistis 
regarded her.

&quot;I guess this is your stop?&quot; She asked as she held the door, her tone 
tinged with worry. Fujin stood awkwardly as their eyes met once more.

&quot;YES.&quot; She said solemnly, swallowing hard as she stepped out of the 
elevator and into the dim light of her chamber beyond.

&quot;Oh..&quot; Quistis whispered with a noticeable of sadness. She paused a 
moment then smiled weakly her eyes quivering with worry. She sorely 
wanted to know what was wrong but knew she couldn&#39;t force any answers.

&quot;I guess I do need to get back and what damage they&#39;ve done.&quot; She 
murmured, trying to smile as she backed into the elevator. Fujin looked 
at her in confusion and frowned noticeably, she didn&#39;t expect her to 
leave.

&quot;STAY.&quot; She said almost pleadingly as she started to reach for her but 
stopped. She looked down and hugged herself, feeling like a fool for her 
outburst. Quistis was caught off guard and looked at her solemnly.

&quot;Kay...&quot; She nodded with a gentle smile, stepping out of the elevator to 
let it leave. Midnight blue light cast scintillating shadows over them 
as they walked into the room. Quistis could tell why Fujin took this 
place as her own, it had a calming aura about that made one feel at 
peace.

They slipped out of their shoes and set them by the door.

&quot;FRESHEN UP.&quot; Fujin said, with a soft smile before heading off to the 
bathroom. Quistis nodded and amused herself by looking at the maze 
spider silk draperies that hung artfully about the chamber. Running a 
lazy finger along one she marved at the texture and wondered where they 
came from. With a carefree sigh she unbuttoned the top few buttons on 
her blouse and made her way to the makeshift kitchen. While not much to 
look at it served its purpose well enough.

She could hear Fujin start the shower and looked thoughtfully in that 
direction as she fixed herself a drink. The mischievous thought of 
joining her crossed her mind causing her to smile deliciously. She 
brushed the idea aside realizing Fujin was out of sorts about something 
and that wouldn&#39;t help matters.

Letting the water cascade down her face and chest Fujin sighed and 
rubbed her temples. She was frightened, not of Quistis, but of her own 
lack of experience. She didn&#39;t know how to care for someone, to love 
them. Would she make a fool of herself.

&quot;Would she laugh at me?&quot; The though came to her like an unwelcome 
houseguest causing her to frown.

&quot;Of course not.&quot; She scolded herself, she knew Quistis understood and 
truly cared for her. That&#146;s why she was letting her set the pace of 
their relationship. While thankful, Fujin sort of wished that she&#39;d lead 
the way.

&quot;Then perhaps I wouldn&#39;t be worrying so much.&quot;

A curious though suddenly crossed her mind and she wondered if she 
should&#39;ve read something or asked someone for advice.

&quot;Read what, seedy magazines or flowery romance novels? Better yet ask 
who, Edea, Cid, oh how about Rinoa or Squall?&quot; The ludicrousness caused 
her to laugh aloud. Shaking her head she smiled grimly.

&quot;You&#39;re alone in this one. Who knows there&#39;s a good chance Quistis is 
just as nervous as you are.&quot; She reasoned trying to reassure herself.

&quot;YEAH RIGHT.&quot; She smirked and turned off the shower.

Sitting quietly on the bed Quistis looked thoughtfully at the picture of 
herself that Fujin had sneaked out of her apartment. A smile crossed her 
lips as she realized they needed one of them together.

&quot;Should&#39;ve gotten one while we were on vacation.&quot; She mumbled absently.

Fujin was taking her sweet time she noticed and hoped she&#39;d come to her 
about what was troubling her. She knew how nervous she got when they 
where alone together and felt sorry for her. To be alone so long without 
knowing any tenderness or love would be hard for anyone. She wished 
desperately to know how to make her feel more at ease.

Sprawled out comfortably on the bed she closed her eyes and as she tried 
to figure out how to help.

&quot;What can I do..?&quot; She whispered, without realizing it she soon found 
herself drifting off to sleep.

Some time later soft lips pressed against hers, causing her to wake. 
Slowly opening her eyes she smiled softly as Fujin leaned over her. She 
wore a simple long nightshirt, her slivery hair and pale skin still 
glistening from the shower.

&quot;Sorry I guess I drifted....&quot; Quistis started, Fujin silenced her by 
placing a finger to her lips and smiling darkly. There was something in 
her ruby hued gaze that smoldered with an intensity that made Quistis 
weaken.

Leaning closer Fujin nuzzled her neck, kissing gently as she went. 
Gasping softly Quistis closed her eyes and trembled in unexpected 
delight. Turning her head she searched hungrily with her lips and found 
Fujin&#39;s waiting for her. The kiss was passionate and quickly grew in 
intensity. Wrapping her arms around Fujin&#39;s back Quistis urged her to 
join her on the bed. All to eager to comply she carefully settled 
herself atop the silken sheets.

Breaking the kiss, Fujin bit her lip shyly, looking out through the 
falls of her hair. Reaching out Quistis brushed the hair aside and 
smiled fondly. Not knowing how to respond Fujin blushed and looked away. 
Taking her hand in hers Quistis brought it to her lips, kissing the palm 
and down her wrist teasingly.

Awash in unaccustomed feelings and emotions her heart pounded in her 
ears as a she felt a warm tingle low in her stomach. With timid 
fingertips she delicately traced her way down Quistis&#39;s arm. Quistis 
looked at her thoughtfully; having no idea how to respond Fujin blushed 
sheepishly.

Smiled reassuringly Quistis carefully took her hand in hers and placed 
it on her blouse. She urged her forward with her eyes, Fujin nodded 
shyly, and then with trembling hands she began carefully unbuttoning. 
Quistis ran a soothing hand through Fujin&#39;s hair while trying not to 
appear as nervous as she really was. This promised to be far more 
intimate than their time at the resort and the very thought frightened 
and excited her.

Their eyes met and Fujin was heartened see a burning desire that matched 
her own in. She slipped the blouse from her Quistis shoulders relieving 
a lacey black satin bra that was designed to tantalize and accentuate. 
Quistis slid her arms free of the blouse and leaned forward to softly 
caress Fujin&#39;s cheek causing her to sigh dreamily. Quistis found it 
adorable and with a grin kissed her deeply. Fujin was startled, as their 
tongues met, it was a new experience but she soon found it very natural 
and. She let her hands explore of their own volition as they moved along 
the gentle curves of Quistis waist and back. Quistis too explored, 
caressing along Fujin&#39;s taunt, firm legs, making her way under her shirt 
to settle comfortably on her hip.

Finally feeling more at ease Fujin grinned softly. Quistis settled back 
on her hands and crossed her legs seductively. Arching her brow she 
looked expectantly at Fujin. Fujin blinked and blushed anew, a sharp 
contrast considering her pale, porcelain skin. Quistis smiled enticingly 
and looked down at her skirt then back up to Fujin who leaned away 
slightly and regarded her with a wary but playful expression. Then, with 
an impish grin she slipped the skirt down Quistis&#39;s thighs with a 
taunting slowness. Watching her Quistis had an odd feeling of pride; 
Fujin was starting to overcome her shyness she noted. Raising her legs 
to let Fujin remove the garment she then fell back on the bed and 
stretched teasingly. All worries and fear began to slowly fade in 
Fujin&#39;s mind as she watched the vision of beauty before her. Suddenly 
she felt somewhat misplaced and undeserving causing her to look down 
self-consciously.

Quistis could tell what she was thinking and would have none of it. 
Sitting up she pulled her close with a deliberateness that quickly 
dissipated any doubts either of them may have had.

Gasping in surprise at the move, Fujin surrendered as Quistis settled 
her back onto the bed. Smirking wickedly Quistis showered her with 
fluttering kisses as she made her way down her neck where she then 
nibbled playfully along her collar. Fujin squirmed and giggled 
girlishly, Quistis growled cutely and nibbled again, this time causing 
her to laugh brightly.

Smiling contently Quistis raised up slightly to look down on her with 
loving eyes. With a happy sigh Fujin returned the gaze with growing 
interest, biting her lip shyly and smiling shakily she brought her hands 
up to softly cup Quistis&#39;s breasts. Quistis closed her eyes and shivered 
at the touch, leaning down more she pressed herself against her hands 
encouragingly. Fujin caressed and kneaded gently causing Quistis to moan 
softly as she gazed down through eyes heavy with passion and need. They 
shared a slow smoldering kiss that served only to fuel their growing 
hunger.

Sitting up Quistis eased Fujin&#39;s nightshirt up prompting her to slip the 
garment off leaving her naked except for the cute mog patterned panties 
she wore. Quistis giggled at the sight of the mogs smiling up at her. 
Fujin&#39;s body glistened with the heat she was feeling and Quistis looked 
down at her with burning eyes as she slipped out of her bra. They 
snuggled close together, kissing, touching, and tasting as they fed off 
each other&#39;s wants and desires.

They enjoyed each other for long moments before settling into each 
other&#39;s arms kissing delicately. With a gentle and light touch Quistis 
ran her fingertips along Fujin&#39;s firm stomach. Closing her eyes Fujin 
whimpered softly, Quistis cradled her against her chest, whispering 
soothing words as she stroked her hair. Fujin trembled in a mix of fear 
and anticipation as Quistis&#39;s hand slipped under the hem of her panties. 
She gasped aloud as Quistis&#39;s fingertips found her; new sensuous 
sensations set her mind and body aflame.

Not knowing how to deal with what she was feeling, she found that tears 
came all too easy. Quistis held her close comforting her with soft 
whispers as she settled into a delicate rhythm of gentle caresses. Fujin 
moved in synch with her touch, as her body responded to a call as old as 
time. A quite whimper escaped her lips and Quistis kissed her softly. In 
all her life Fujin had never felt such exquisite turmoil, she felt as 
though she where slowly falling into a sea of pleasure, and yet she was 
still frightened of the unknown and resisted. Her fevered mind thought 
of who held her, and how she&#39;d come to love and trust. She knew she was 
no longer alone, and that someone would be there for her, to love her 
and that knowledge soothed her fears. She closed her eyes tight; giving 
herself to the raw, unbridled passions that enveloped her.

Quistis smiled warmly and closed her eyes she could feel Fujin letting 
go of her fears and concerns. She was overjoyed for her and continued 
the delicate ministrations with loving care. It wasn&#39;t long until Fujin 
felt a warm pressure quickly building deep within her. She brought a 
hand to her mouth and bit down to keep from crying out as the sensation 
threatened to overwhelm her.

She could take no more as her whole body tensed sharply. She cried out 
softly as the pressure burst into series of shuttering waves that shook 
her to her core. With a warm luxurious smile Quistis hugged her close. 
Fujin trembled as the waves cascaded through her, each one growing 
weaker until they finally vanished, leaving her spent and shaking with 
emotion. Tears streamed down her cheeks and Quistis kissed them away as 
she pulled the blankets around them. Fujin curled closer and clung to 
Quistis as she slowly rocked her. It was quiet except for the rhythmic 
thrum of Balamb&#39;s engines and after while Fujin&#39;s quite sobs ended and 
she sniffed lightly. She looked up slowly, her hair clinging wetly to 
her face. As their eyes met Quistis saw for the first time the woman 
she&#39;d fallen in love with, the one Fujin tried desperately to keep 
buried. The fragile, passionate dreamer full of hope for the future, the 
woman who was not afraid of her feelings or what they would bring.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Fujin asked softly seeing the tears in her eyes.

Quistis shook her head smiled hugging her tightly.

&quot;Love you..&quot; She whispered, kissing her on the forehead.

&quot;Love you too...&quot; Fujin, said softly.</pre>
