<p>The Cold  Loner</p>
<p>Xu lay in her bed  wondering what was to become of the rest of her life. She knew that her  comrades would sense the sadness when she returned to her office. They weren’t  SeeD for nothing. It was so cold, she realized, without someone and not just  anyone beside her. She remembered the gentle warmth that being beside Quistis  generated. She didn’t understand why Quistis had to be so self-reliant. It hurt  her so much to see her suffer alone. Xu stood up and walked out the door, only  to bump into Quistis. Her heart stopped, perhaps it was fate. The instructor  was clad in peach colored pjs.</p>
<p>“Sorry.” She  apologized.</p>
<p>“What are you doing up  so late?” Xu asked as gently as possible.</p>
<p>“Couldn’t sleep.”  Quistis replied, not looking at her. They stood there in silence for a while  and Xu thought she was going to die from it. “Xu…actually I wanted to talk to  you. I never got a chance to explain…”</p>
<p>“Don’t.” Xu said  quickly. “I understand. You’re busy, there’s havoc going on. I know you never  had time for a relationship. It was my fault for even starting it.” Quistis  thought she was going to break apart at Xu’s words.</p>
<p>“It’s not your fault. I  just…right now…” She sighed. “I had a dream. In it, Ultimecia was carrying your  body. Except, she wasn’t the one who killed you, I was. And then Hyne appeared  and said that you would die if I didn’t distance myself. He told me that if I  continued living, then I would eventually aid Ultimecia into her rise.”</p>
<p>“That’s bullshit!” Xu  yelled, startling her. She was never one to curse but the situation called for  it. “Quistis, you’re going to believe some dream over your feelings!”</p>
<p>“The voices too. Right  now there’s so much going on that even if I wanted to start a relationship  everything would fall apart.” She replied.</p>
<p>“I know, I’m confused  too. Everything began so great.”</p>
<p>“We can still be friends.”  Quistis offered. Xu forced a smile and nodded. That was always how things  ended. “We can still be friends” were the words that she had grown used to but  coming from someone that she cared about more than Ultimecia, more than  herself, her rank, everything was just too much.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m just going  to bed…ok?” Quistis said. She gave a brief smile before making her way down the  hallway. Xu leaned against her doorway, tears already shining in her eyes and  she forgot why she had even exited her room.</p>

Quistis woke up feeling  sadder and lonelier than ever. Perhaps Xu was right, maybe she shouldn’t listen  to the voice and her dreams. She had just thrown away something important; Xu.  In her heart, she knew she loved her and just seeing her doubt that was too  much. She rolled out of bed and took a cold shower, no longer able to  distinguish the difference between the water coming out of the shower head and  the tears running down her cheeks. As she got out, she checked the clock. There  was only one hour before she had to meet up with the others on their journey to  Dollet. She walked out of the room, half expecting Xu to be there waiting for  her with a smile but instead all she saw was the gray mist of the early morning  obscuring most of her view. She sighed and took the first step into the new  day.
<p>Xu wasn’t in the  cafeteria either. <em>She’s probably still sleeping,</em> Quistis thought. She  didn’t understand why she had to go along on the mission. She was an instructor  again. But obviously Squall wanted her to go along just in case there was  something serious.</p>
<p>“Instructor Trepe!”  Mira, one of the youngest students in her class waved her hand in the air as  she neared.</p>
<p>“Miss Yrate, what are  you doing up so early?” The student cocked her head to one side in confusion.</p>
<p>“It’s six o’clock. All  students usually get up this early to go to the training center. Are you  feeling all right?” Quistis shook her head and smiled at her pitiful state.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m perfectly  fine. I’m just a little sleepy I guess.” She chuckled.</p>
<p>“There’s been a rumor  going around that there’s a very dangerous person that Headmaster Cid is taking  care of. Is it true?” Mira asked.</p>
<p>“That’s classified  information. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to leave. There’s a mission that  Commander Leonhart wants me to join in on. You’ll have substitute Aki for  substitute.” Instantly, the girl blanched.</p>
<p>“Not Instructor Aki!  He’s the meanest of the instructors! You can’t be serious, Instructor Trepe!”  She whined.</p>
<p>“Just follow his directions  fully and everything will be all right.” She left the panicked girl alone in  the cafeteria. The others were waiting for her outside the gate. She and Zell  were the last to arrive.</p>
<p>“It’ll be just like old  times! We’re going on really risky missions, putting our lives on the line to  save innocent people!” Selphie squealed happily. Irvine put an arm around her  to steady the ball of hyperactive energy.</p>
<p>“I don’t recall putting  our lives on the line being fun.” Quistis remarked.</p>
<p>“It’s excitement!”  Selphie replied quickly.</p>
<p>“Rollercoasters are excitement  too.” Zell muttered. Cid and Edea walked over to them. Little Adel was beside  them. Everyone went silent and lined up in respect for their Headmaster.</p>
<p>“At ease.” Cid said and  everyone loosened up a bit but it was obvious that they were uneasy at the  sight of Adel. Quistis especially couldn’t relax because Adel had her eyes on  her, smirking like there was some dark secret she wasn’t sharing.</p>
<p>“Cid and I will be  heading back to the orphanage today. We’ll be staying there unless there is a  dire emergency. I’m sure than Squall will be able to take care of things here.”  Edea said calmly. “We’ll be taking Adel with us.”</p>
<p>“We’ll ask some of the SeeD  to go with you.” Irvine offered. Edea waved off the suggestion.</p>
<p>“It’s not necessary. I’m  sure we’ll be fine on our own. What you need to focus on is the mission.” She  answered.</p>
<p>“That’s right. As you  know, the mayor of Dollet has sent a request for SeeD. The suspicious personnel  have been identified as Galbadian soldiers. They appear to be searching for  someone. We suspect that it may be Adel. The mayor wants you to go and rid them  of the soldiers.” Cid explained.</p>
<p>“Understood.” Squall  replied firmly. “Come on.” He saluted and they got in their cars. The girls got  in one car and the guys got in the other. They drove off in the direction of  Balamb where they were to take the train to Dollet. Squall remembered his first  mission in Dollet. That was where it all began. He obtained the SeeD rank 8 and  met Rinoa and their adventure began. It was all beginning again.</p>
