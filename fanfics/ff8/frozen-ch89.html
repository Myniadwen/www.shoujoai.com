&quot;Is this everything?&quot; Zell groaned, shoving another box of supplies into 
the trunk of their rental car.

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot; Fujin nodded, looking over the invoice Kadowaki had given 
her.

&quot;Well kids, that should do it then.&quot; Said the owner of the 
pharmaceutical warehouse. He was an elderly man, with piercing blue 
eyes, gunmetal gray hair, and severe laugh lines. &quot;Tell Kadowaki she 
needs to come visit once and a while. I&#39;m old; I&#39;m not going to be 
around forever.&quot; The man laughed.

&quot;You got it pops.&quot; Zell chuckled hopping into the driver&#39;s seat. Fujin 
casually made her way around and yanked him.

&quot;Hey, what the hell!?&quot; Zell yelped, falling on his butt.

&quot;TOLD YOU.&quot; Fujin grumbled, taking the drivers seat for herself. 
&quot;DRIVING.&quot;

&quot;Aw come on, you got to drive all the way here, you can at least let me 
drive back to the Ragnarok.&quot; Zell complained, making his way to the 
passenger side of the vehicle.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Ugh, you&#39;re a pain sometimes.&quot;

&quot;YOU FLEW.&quot;

&quot;So!? Oh what, you&#39;re mad because I didn&#39;t let you fly!?&quot; He laughed 
bitterly.

&quot;MY TURN.&quot; Fujin announced mildly before putting the car in gear and 
pulling into traffic.

&quot;Whatever.&quot; Zell sighed, rolling down the window. &quot;Hey look, at least 
swing by Lockhart&#39;s Boutique while we&#39;re here.&quot;

&quot;WHAT!?&quot; WHY?&quot;

&quot;Never you mind, I just need to pick up some stuff.&quot; Zell grumbled 
awkwardly.

&quot;PANTY SNIFFER!&quot; Fujin scowled accusingly.

Sent into a right and proper fit, Zell nearly went into hysterics.

&quot;What!?&quot; He blurted, gawking at her in disbelief. &quot;No! Gah, jeez, what 
the hell kinda guy do you think I am?&quot;

&quot;SNIFFER.&quot; Fujin said again, eyeing him suspiciously.

&quot;Oh for the love of...Keep your eye on the road! I&#39;m not a damned...&quot; He 
started angrily then sighed. &quot;Look, Just go.&quot; He said in exasperation. 
&quot;And if you must know; I only wanted to pick up some stuff for Nicole. 
Satisfied?&quot;

&quot;NO.&quot;

&quot;Figures...&quot;

&quot;WHERE?&quot; Fujin asked sourly.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;STORE?&quot;

&quot;Then you&#39;ll stop.&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Cool, it&#39;s up ahead, take a left.&quot;

&quot;MAKE FAST.&quot;

&quot;Sure, sure, no prob.&quot; Zell nodded merrily. &quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;SNIFFER.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not funny.&quot;

&quot;NOT SUPPOSED TO.&quot; Fujin answered as she pulled into the boutique&#39;s 
parking lot. Hopping out of the car, Zell regarded Fujin curiously as 
she got out to join him.

&quot;You&#39;re actually coming in? I figured you&#39;d turn to stone or something 
in a place like this.&quot;

&quot;HOT IN CAR.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, okay just don&#39;t eat anyone while we&#39;re in here.&quot; He chuckled.

Fujin shoved him inside as they opened the door. A mousy woman wearing a 
demure, powder blue dress moved towards them as the entered.

&quot;Well good afternoon; welcome to Lockhart&#39;s can I help you with 
anything?&quot; She said in a wispy, sales voice. Fujin bristled.

&quot;Hey there.&quot; Zell smiled nervously. &quot;Um, well, I&#39;d like some help with 
my girlfriend.&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes, yes of course, I can see your dilemma.&quot; The woman smiled 
broadly. With a snap of her fingers a small band of young, beautiful 
men, all of whom looked to have stepped out of a men&#39;s fashion magazine, 
descended upon Fujin with an almost frenzied fervor. Each of them 
brandishing, tape measures strips of cloth, and other implements of 
makeover warfare.

Fujin, swatted and barked incoherently at the troupe, chasing them away 
and promising great bodily harm if they returned.

&quot;Oh dear.&quot; The saleswoman frowned. &quot;She&#39;s not one for makeovers I take 
it.&quot; She said in a knowing tone to Zell, who watched the exchange with 
growing amusement.

&quot;Gee honey.&quot; He chuckled, throwing an arm around Fujin&#39;s shoulder. 
&quot;Perhaps you should hear them out. What do ya say?&quot;

The look Fujin gave him was one of such contemptuous loathing and vile 
darkness that even the devils below, would&#39;ve given pause.

&quot;Eh yeah... okay..., she&#39;s not with me.&quot; Zell amended, as he 
subconsciously found himself seeking shelter behind the sales woman. 
&quot;Let&#39;s talk over here.&quot; He said quickly, moving further away as Fujin 
started toward him threateningly. Satisfied that she would be left 
alone, she contented herself with idle browsing among the various lacey 
evening gowns and sleepwear.

A sudden bout of self-consciousness made her blush slightly. She wasn&#39;t 
built for such things, feeling that she was too hard, too awkward. It 
was a minor miracle in her eyes that she was able to pull off the black 
dress for the graduation dance. She smiled at the memory, she hated to 
admit it but it felt good to dress up, to have people stare for other 
reasons other than her being a one eyed, albino freak. Her smiled melted 
and she turned away from the display rack in annoyance.

&quot;Can I help you?&quot; A young, bright-eyed woman smiled hopefully.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin groused but the eager sales person was not about to be 
so easily dissuaded.

&quot;I noticed you looking at the gowns, if I may be so bold, I&#39;d suggest 
something risky. Perhaps with some sheer, I think you&#39;d pull it off 
well, you&#39;ve the build for it. Something, dark blue or black, to 
contrast nicely with your complexion.&quot; The girl explained busily while 
looking for something suitable.

&quot;NOT BUYING.&quot; Fujin explained gruffly.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry, I just saw you browsing.&quot;

&quot;HERE WITH SOMEONE.&quot;

&quot;Ah, okay, you&#39;re the one who came in the that guy. He&#39;s cute, is he 
your boyfriend?&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Oh okay.&quot; The girl nodded, her broad smile cracking slightly in 
disappointment as she realized her chances for making a sale were 
quickly dying. Fujin frowned in though a moment then grabbed the girl&#39;s 
arm as she turned to move back to counter.

&quot;A MOMENT.&quot; She asked quietly.

&quot;Yes!&quot; The girl beamed, her hope renewed.

After an altogether suspicious glance around, Fujin regarded the girl 
curiously.

&quot;ASSISTANCE?&quot; She asked flatly.

&quot;Um. Okay, what can I do?&quot;

&quot;PURCHASE, FOR FRIEND.&quot;

&quot;Ah, okay, I assume it&#39;s for a lady friend, unless it&#39;s a guy with 
strange tastes.&quot; The girl giggled, trying to lighten Fujin&#39;s obviously 
tense mood. She failed miserably and the girl slumped visibly.

&quot;NEW RIGHT?&quot; Fujin asked, feeling uncharacteristically sympathetic to 
her plight.&quot;

&quot;Yeah... is it that obvious.&quot;

&quot;VERY.&quot;

&quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;IRRELEVANT, CAN ASSIST?&quot; Fujin asked with a sigh.

&quot;Huh?&quot; The girl blinked, somewhat confused by her odd manner of speech.

&quot;WILL YOU HELP?&quot;

&quot;Oh, oh, yes of course!&quot; The girl chirped. &quot;What&#39;s this friend of yours 
look like?&quot;

&quot;THIS TALL.&quot; Fujin gestured with her hand then glanced around a moment 
before finding a mannequin close to Quistis&#39; build. Pointing to it, she 
nodded. &quot;SIMILAR BUILD.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re from the islands aren&#39;t you, south of Dollet.&quot; The girl guessed 
brightly, out of the blue.

Fujin looked at her sourly, annoyed by her lack of attention.

&quot;NO.&quot; She answered sternly.

&quot;Hmm, I was just trying to guess you&#39;re accent.&quot;

Fujin had a minor urge to throttle her then continued the description in 
hopes that somehow the girl was paying attention.

&quot;YOU&#39;RE COMPLEXION.&quot; She continued thoughtfully. &quot;BLONDE, BLUE EYES.&quot;

&quot;Ah okay.&quot; The girl nodded merrily then started digging through the 
outfits. Fishing one out, Fujin blanched in disapproval. The thing was 
tacky; there was no other word for it.

&quot;NEGATIVE! UGH!&quot; She groaned.

&quot;TASTES, SOPHISTICATED.&quot; She elaborated, getting flustered and more than 
a little embarrassed.

&quot;Ah, an intellectual.&quot; The girl said knowingly.

Fujin nodded in agreement.

&quot;How&#39;s this?&quot; The girl offered; this time holding up something more 
fitting the style of someone&#39;s grandmother than the paragon of fashion 
sense that was Quistis. Fujin made a low noise in her throat, marking 
her disapproval.

Undeterred, the girl fished around some more then paused.

&quot;Hmm, leather or lace?&quot; The girl asked innocently, causing Fujin to 
blush profusely.

&quot;LACE, LACE!&quot; She sputtered quickly, earning an odd look from the girl.

&quot;Um...okay...&quot; The young woman mouthed quietly, resuming her search. 
After a moment she held up yet another outfit. Fujin shook her head and 
frowned.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; She sighed, then fished around herself. After a moment she 
found something elegant and soft. A quaint smile appeared on her lips 
and she nodded slightly.

&quot;That one?&quot; The girl smiled hopefully, eyeing her thoughtfully.

Fujin nodded and passed it to her. &quot;WRAP PLEASE.&quot;

&quot;Allrighty then.&quot; The girl said heading for the counter only to pause. 
Fujin glanced at her curiously. &quot;Um, you know.&quot; The girl started 
awkwardly, moving towards another display. &quot;If I may make a suggestion?&quot; 
She said in a respectably discrete tone. Fujin frowned sternly, unsure 
if she was going to like where this was going. Tentatively, the girl 
retrieved a modest, but graceful looking item.

&quot;I think you&#39;d look lovely in this, and I bet she&#39;d think so to.&quot; The 
girl smiled quietly. Fujin was stunned speechless and the girl chuckled 
slightly. &quot;Trust, me, she&#39;ll like it.&quot;

Fujin stammered slightly and nodded.

&quot;Um...THANKS....&quot; She said quietly.

With that, the two walked back to the counter where the girl went about 
packaging the items and gift wrapping Quistis&#39; present.

Fujin was just paying for everything when Zell came bounding towards 
her.

&quot;Yo Fuji, ya ready to go.&quot;

&quot;FUJIN!&quot;

&quot;Fujin, ya, ya, are you ready to go or not?&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot; Fujin huffed, gathering the bags.

&quot;Have a good afternoon, come back and see us.&quot; The sales girl waved 
cheerfully. Fujin gave a polite nod back as they headed out the door. 
Once outside Zell circled around Fujin curiously.

&quot;Hey cool, you did some shopping to eh?&quot; He asked nosily.

Fujin ignored him, praying that he dropped the subject.

&quot;What&#39;d you buy?&quot; He grinned wolfishly.

&quot;DINCHT.&quot; She glowered.

&quot;What, what, I was only curious?&quot;

&quot;DROP IT.&quot;

&quot;Is it something for Miss Trepe?&quot;

&quot;STOP IT.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s wrapped, so I bet it is.&quot;

&quot;SILENCE.&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;SHUT UP.&quot;

&quot;You bought something naughty.&quot; He teetered.

&quot;ZELL!&quot; She snapped, swatting at him, only to have him bound away 
laughingly.

&quot;You get something too?&quot; He asked slyly, well out of reach.

Fujin took a deep breath and unlocked the rental car. Zell looked 
astounded. &quot;You did didn&#39;t you! Whoa, I just can&#39;t imagine you in 
anything like that.&quot; He chuckled jokingly, getting into the passenger 
seat. Fujin took the comment hard and frowned slightly.

Oblivious, Zell buckled up as she started the car and began the drive 
back to the Ragnarok. She was only moderately aware of his inane chatter 
as they made their way through the dense traffic towards the small 
airport where they&#39;d landed. After several long minutes, Zell finally 
noticed her sullen expression.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?&quot; He asked curiously.

Fujin didn&#39;t respond as she parked the car and gathered their things.

&quot;Hey Fujin?&quot; He called to her as he retrieved the remainder of the 
medical supplies. Again, she ignored him and he had to jog to catch up 
as she took long strides across the tarmac leading to the Ragnarok.

&quot;Yo Fu Hold up! He cried out worriedly, catching up with her. Without a 
word, she typed in the code to open the ships hatch and made her way 
inside.

&quot;Aw come on, don&#39;t give me the cold shoulder treatment, what&#39;d I do!?&quot; 
Zell groaned in dismay as they stowed their things.

&quot;ZELL.&quot; She replied finally, in an oddly quiet tone.

&quot;Yeah?&quot; He responded eagerly; glad to have gotten some sort of response.

&quot;PLEASE, DROP IT.&quot; She said quietly, still not facing him. Zell frowned 
sadly, noting the slight quaver in her voice.

&quot;Um...look...&quot; He mumbled quietly. &quot;If this is about my comment 
earlier... I didn&#39;t mean that like it sounded.&quot;

&quot;DON&#39;T.&quot; She snapped slightly, tossing her bags gruffly atop the medical 
supplies then made her way towards the bridge.

&quot;Shit.&quot; Zell groaned, angry with himself that he&#39;d pushed her too far. 
&quot;Ya idiot...what did you do?&quot;

Fujin was already in her seat and listening to her headphones when he 
finally made his way to the bridge. Sitting down, he started the ship 
then turned to regard her as it cycled to life.

&quot;Fujin.&quot; He tried once more. She turned to regard him coldly a moment 
then promptly ignored him.

&quot;Look, I wasn&#39;t trying to say you&#39;re ugly.&quot; He said quietly. &quot;I was just 
trying to get a rise out of you. You know how we always mess with each 
other.&quot; He tried feebly. &quot;Ah hell Fujin, I&#39;m sorry, really.&quot;

Fujin turned of her headset but still didn&#146;t look at him.

&quot;Alright.&quot; He sighed. &quot;I&#39;m going to tell you something, something no one 
knows. You can laugh at me if you want, but I think you probably need to 
hear it.&quot;

Running an awkward hand through his hair, he gazed at the blinking 
panels on the ship&#39;s dash to avoid looking at her. &quot;I uh, well I used to 
have a big crush on you...&quot; He said nervously. That got Fujin&#39;s 
attention and she turned to regard him slightly. &quot;Well, I guess I still 
do a bit. I mean don&#39;t get me wrong!&quot; He added firmly. &quot;I love Nicole 
more than anything in the world and I know you feel the same for Miss 
Trepe, but sometimes I wonder what could have happened if things hadn&#39;t 
gotten so out of hand. I mean with the war.&quot; He said blushing slightly. 
&quot;Well then there was the time you took over my town.&quot; He added with a 
chuckle. &quot;You know, I got say, that was hurt by that, I never expected 
anything like that from you.&quot; He continued with a solemn shrug. 
&quot;Anyway...&quot; He sighed. &quot;I never said anything about it before because I 
was worried what people would think, that and I uh...well, I was kinda 
of scared of Seifer.&quot; He finished, feeling stupid but yet relived now 
that he&#39;d spoken his mind. &quot;Okay, you can laugh now.&quot; He announced with 
a nervous grin.

Fujin took a slow breath and looked at him silently. What was going on 
behind her piercing crimson gaze, Zell couldn&#39;t begin to fathom, but he 
could easily envision her leaping across the cockpit and killing him

After a moment she nodded in understanding.

&quot;APOLOGY ACCEPTED.&quot; She mumbled somewhat surprised by the turn of 
events. &quot;I.&quot; She started awkwardly. &quot;APOLOGIZE AS WELL.&quot; She finished, 
then without another word, switched on her headphones and settled back 
in her seat. Breathing a sigh of relief, Zell smiled brightly and kicked 
on the Ragnarok&#39;s thrusters.

*******************

Nicole walked quietly up the hall towards the clinic; in her hand she 
carried a small box of scented bath soaps and lotions, a get-well for 
Quistis. As she neared, she became aware of the haunting sounds of a 
saxophone echoing nearby. Slightly puzzled, she continued on her way 
until pausing at the door of Kadowaki&#39;s office. The music was coming 
from within; it was a moody tune, rich with texture and a hint of 
sadness.

&quot;What in the world.&quot; Nicole grinned as she made her way to Quistis&#39; 
room. Finding the door ajar, she peeked in curiously. Kadowaki and Xu 
sat nearby as Quistis sat on the edge of the bed playing an expensive 
looking Saxophone. Noting her presence, Quistis grinned from around the 
mouthpiece then sat the instrument down.

&quot;Oh Nikki, hi there!&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t know you knew how to play one of those.&quot; Nicole chuckled 
walking over to her.

&quot;Yup, I used to play a lot when I was younger.&quot; Quistis giggled. &quot;But to 
be honest I&#39;m a little rusty. Heck, the last time I played was at that 
little impromptu concert we held in Fisherman&#39;s Horizon.&quot;

&quot;Our Miss Trepe here won five musical achievement awards with the Balamb 
Arts League.&quot; Kadowaki dotted proudly.

&quot;Please, that was a long time ago.&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;Wow, you&#39;re just an all around overachiever.&quot; Nicole grinned.

&quot;Yeah, don&#39;t you just hate he?.&quot; Xu said laughingly.

&quot;Honestly though, that was pretty good.&quot; Nicole grinned.

&quot;Please, it was just a hobby.&quot; Quistis laughed. &quot;Xu found it stowed away 
and brought it to me, I&#39;d forgotten all about it.&quot;

&quot;Ah well, I brought you something. I figured you&#39;d appreciate it.&quot; 
Nicole said, handing Quistis the bag.

&quot;Oh wow, thanks.&quot; Quistis bubbled brightly, sniffing the soaps daintily. 
&quot;Strawberries, nice!&quot;

&quot;Told you you&#39;d like it.&quot; Nicole smiled, then turned regarded Xu. 
&quot;Congratulations on the promotion. Headmaster Xu.&quot;

&quot;Say that again, I like the sound of that.&quot; Xu giggled.

&quot;What&#39;s Nida think about all this?&quot; Nicole asked.

&quot;He&#39;s thrilled to death honestly, so long as he can keep his position.&quot;

&quot;The boy has no drive.&quot; Quistis chuckled.

&quot;It&#39;s not that. He&#39;s just happy where he is.&quot; Xu explained in his 
defense.

&quot;We&#39;re back!&quot; Zell proclaimed loudly, announcing his presence with a 
bold and boisterous flourish.

&quot;Darn, and it was just getting fun.&quot; Xu sighed.

&quot;Eat me.&quot; Zell snorted as Nicole greeted him with a warm hug.

&quot;Where&#39;s Fujin?&quot; Quistis asked, looking towards the door hopefully.

&quot;She&#39;s putting away the supplies.&quot;

&quot;Well gang, I got to get back, I have a lot of studying today. Cid&#39;s a 
real taskmaster.&quot; Xu waved cheerfully.

&quot;Welcome to the club.&quot; Quistis grinned.

&quot;Yeah, yeah, you&#39;ve always been better at this sort of thing. Perhaps 
I&#39;ll ask you for some pointers later.&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m going anywhere.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t talk like that; you&#39;ll be on your feet in no time.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know. It&#39;s just frustrating.&quot;

&quot;I bet, anyway, see you around, bye.&quot; Xu waved merrily, bumping into 
Fujin on the way out. &quot;Found her!&quot; She chuckled, while Fujin looked 
somewhat confused.

&quot;Welcome home.&quot; Quistis beamed.

Offering a smile, Fujin set about putting away the bags she&#39;d brought 
with her.

&quot;Whatcha have there?&quot; Quistis asked curiously.

&quot;LATER.&quot; Fujin said blandly then made her way to her side.

&quot;We should head out too.&quot; Zell coughed discretely to Nicole.

&quot;But I just got here.&quot; Nicole pouted.

&quot;We&#39;ll come back later, I got you something.&quot;

&quot;Oh a gift? For me?&quot; Nicole beamed.

&quot;Yup.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll see you later Nikki, thanks for the soaps.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome. I guess I&#39;ll see you guys later then. See ya Quistis, 
Fujin.&quot;

&quot;FAREWELL.&quot; Fujin waved politely.

&quot;Hmm that was odd.&quot; Quistis noted curiously. &quot;I wonder why he left; you 
guys get in a fight again did you?&quot;

&quot;UNIMPORTANT.&quot;

&quot;Oh heck, what happened now?&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;NOTHING.&quot; Fujin shrugged, sniffing the bag Nicole brought. &quot;NICE.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re a bad liar and you&#39;re trying to change the subject.&quot;

&quot;MINOR.&quot;

&quot;Somehow I doubt that. You shouldn&#39;t let him bother you so, it&#39;s just 
his way, he&#39;s just trying to be friendly.&quot;

&quot;I KNOW.&quot; Fujin said casually.

&quot;Then why are you upset.&quot;

&quot;NOT.&quot;

&quot;Fine, fine, whatever.&quot; Quistis relented then grinned slyly. &quot;So, what&#39;s 
in the bag?&quot;

**************************

&quot;Okay boys; it&#39;s checkout time.&quot; Celest announced, making her way into 
the cellblock. Raijin, Seifer and Miguel stood together, eager to be 
released.

&quot;About damn time.&quot; Seifer grumbled.

&quot;Don&#39;t get snotty, I can leave you in here all night.&quot; Celest smiled 
wickedly.

&quot;Be silent.&quot; Miguel mumbled sternly to Seifer.

&quot;Yeah man, hell hath no fury and all that, ya know.&quot;

&quot;Smart man.&quot; Celest giggled, opening the door.

&quot;Freedom.&quot; Miguel smiled broadly.

&quot;Free to go?&quot; Raijin asked warily.

&quot;Yup, just stay out of trouble.&quot;

&quot;Very well, I will retire to dine then, farewell.&quot; Miguel announced 
briskly before quickly exiting the room.

&quot;He&#39;s in a hurry?&quot; Celest wondered aloud.

&quot;He really didn&#39;t like being penned up, ya know.&quot; Raijin explained 
sympathetically.

&quot;Like anyone does.&quot; Seifer huffed.

&quot;Perhaps you guys will remember that next time you go on a drunken 
rampage.&quot;

&quot;It was hardly a rampage.&quot; Seifer sighed.

&quot;Regardless, rules are rules.&quot; Celest nagged jokingly.

&quot;Hyne, you sound like Xu.&quot;

&quot;Hey, piss her off when I&#39;m not around.&quot; Raijin laughed. &quot;See you guys 
later. Oh and think about what we discussed. I think it&#39;d be a good idea 
ya know.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah, sure.&quot; Seifer frowned slightly, annoyed at being pestered.

&quot;Good.&quot; Raijin smirked then hurried to catch up with Miguel.

Celest watched him go then rocked back on her heels grinning widely.

&quot;What&#39;s that about?&quot; Seifer asked warily.

&quot;Nothing.&quot; Celest giggled, then entwined her arm with his.

&quot;Now I know something is up.&quot;

&quot;Not at all.&quot;

&quot;Alright then, now what?&quot;

&quot;You tell me.&quot; She smiled brightly.

&quot;I got you.&quot; He chuckled. &quot;How about we have talk.&quot;

&quot;I was thinking the same thing.&quot; She nodded happily. Caught up by her 
infectious nature, Seifer couldn&#39;t help smile.

&quot;Come on.&quot; He chuckled, as they headed out.

**********************

&quot;Fujin Kazeno, you get out here this instant!&quot; Quistis ordered from the 
confines of her bed.

&quot;NO...&quot; Fujin mumbled from behind the bathroom door.

&quot;You&#39;re being foolish, just come out.&quot;

&quot;NUH UH.&quot;

&quot;Fujin!&quot;

&quot;NO.&quot;

&quot;Just come out here; why are you being so silly?&quot;

&quot;EMBARRASSED.&quot;

&quot;Oh, for the love of... I&#39;ve seen you naked for crying out loud, what 
are you ashamed of?&quot;

&quot;SILLY.&quot; Fujin pouted sullenly.

&quot;No you are not.&quot;

&quot;UH HUH.&quot;

Quistis couldn&#39;t help but laugh.

&quot;LAUGHING!&quot; Fujin cried in dismay.

&quot;No I&#39;m not.&quot;

&quot;HEARD YOU.&quot;

&quot;Okay maybe I was, but only because you&#39;re being ridiculous.&quot;

&quot;SEE!.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean it like that and you know it.&quot;

&quot;HUMPF.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t pout.&quot;

&quot;NOT POUTING.&quot;

&quot;Fine then, sulking.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Fujin!&quot;

&quot;NO.&quot;

&quot;Look; why&#39;d you buy it then?&quot;

&quot;WAS TRICKED.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t believe that, you&#39;re anything but a sucker.&quot; Quistis chuckled 
then got a devilish gleam in her eyes. &quot;What a minute, we&#39;re not talking 
leather are we? I have a whip you know.&quot;

Fujin made a startled cry of embarrassment.

&quot;I was joking!&quot; Quistis laughed.

&quot;GETTING DRESSED.&quot;

&quot;You put me through all this rigmarole and now you&#39;re getting dressed!?&quot;

&quot;RIGAWHAT?&quot;

&quot;Quit changing the subject and come out here.&quot;

&quot;YOU&#39;LL LAUGH.&quot;

&quot;I will not!&quot;

&quot;WILL TOO.&quot;

Quistis tossed her hands into the air in frustration &quot;Women...!&quot; She 
growled then threw a pillow at the bathroom door. &quot;So help me if I could 
walk.&quot; She huffed in annoyance prompting a muffled cry of dismay from 
Fujin.

&quot;Oh now what?&quot;

&quot;MAD AT ME!&quot;

&quot;I am not.&quot;

&quot;ARE TOO.&quot; Fujin mumbled sadly.

Quistis&#39; eyes grew wide in disbelief at the absurdness of the situation.

&quot;Fujin.&quot; She called quietly.

&quot;WHAT?&quot;

&quot;I love you.&quot;

&quot;REALLY?&quot;

&quot;Silly, you know I do.&quot;

&quot;NOT MAD?&quot;

&quot;Of course not. Look honey, if you&#39;re not comfortable wearing it then 
don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;WAS CUTE THOUGH.&quot;

&quot;Then what&#39;s the matter?&quot;

&quot;DON&#39;T KNOW.&quot;

&quot;Am I missing something?&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Okay now I know something&#39;s wrong.&quot; Quistis frowned. &quot;This isn&#39;t just 
you being shy, something happened.&quot;

Silence answered.

&quot;Fujin?&quot;

&quot;YES?&quot;

&quot;Did someone say something to you?&quot;

&quot;NOT IMPORTANT.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be the judge of that.&quot; Quistis frowned, folding her arms her 
features darkening. &quot;It was Zell wasn&#39;t it!? That little... I was 
wondering why he left so fast. What did he say!?&quot;

&quot;NOT HIS FAULT.&quot;

&quot;Ah, so it was him!&quot; Quistis glowered, he brow furrowing in anger.

The bathroom door opened and Fujin poked her head out shyly.

&quot;MADE AMENDS.&quot;

&quot;With you perhaps, but I&#39;ll wring his little neck.&quot;

&quot;IS OKAY.&quot; Fujin sighed, stepping out of the bathroom timidly, wearing 
the evening gown she&#39;d bought. Still in mid rant about Zell, Quistis 
didn&#39;t immediately notice then paused. Fujin offered a shy smile then 
rubbed her eye with her palm.

&quot;Now look at there.&quot; Quistis smiled warmly. &quot;You look lovely.&quot;

&quot;JUST SAYING THAT.&quot;

&quot;No I&#39;m not, come here.&quot; Quistis cooed. &quot;That&#146;s beautiful, did you pick 
that out yourself?&quot;

&quot;SOME HELP...&quot;

&quot;Not Zell I hope...&quot;

&quot;NO.&quot; Fujin giggled, sitting down on the side of the bed.

&quot;All that fuss.&quot; Quistis smiled, brushing stray locks of hair from 
Fujin&#39;s face. &quot;You look wonderful hon.&quot;

&quot;REALLY?&quot;

&quot;Of course I would you goose.&quot;

&quot;THANK YOU.&quot;

&quot;No, thank you.&quot; Quistis smiled richly, stealing a kiss.

Fujin blushed brightly then exhaled with a relieved smile.

&quot;HOME.&quot; She finally said with a hint of annoyance.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;CLINIC... UNCOMFORTABLE.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Quistis nodded. &quot;I know what you mean I&#39;m about ready to go stir 
crazy. Lets see if Kadowaki will let me go back to my apartment soon. If 
anything our little jaunt outside should prove I&#39;m well enough to move.&quot;

&quot;TRUE.&quot;

&quot;I wonder.&quot; Quistis chuckled. &quot;Now that you&#39;ve given me a ring, does 
that mean you&#39;ll be moving in?&quot;

Fujin blinked, caught off guard by the question.

&quot;UM....&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot;

&quot;DON&#39;T HAVE TOO...&quot; Fujin mouthed, unsure what Quistis was getting at.

Quistis looked hurt and pouted.

&quot;What, you don&#39;t want to stay with me?&quot;

&quot;DIDN&#39;T SAY THAT!?&quot; Fujin sputtered. &quot;I, WOULD, I MEAN...&quot; She continued 
babbling.

Quistis pressed a hand to her cheek and smiled laughingly.

&quot;I&#39;m teasing hon, calm down. I&#39;d love for you to stay.&quot;

Fujin breathed a sigh then shoved her gently.

&quot;MEAN.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;NO YOU&#39;RE NOT.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;BRAT!&quot; Fujin gawked in surprise then fell upon her with ticklish 
intent.

Quistis squawked in complete surprise. &quot;No, wait, stop, no fair, I&#39;m 
helpless!&quot; She screeched as their laughter echoed into the night.
