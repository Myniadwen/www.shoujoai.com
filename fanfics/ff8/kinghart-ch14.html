<p align="center">How Rumors  Start</p>
<p>Xu woke up first and  saw the beautiful girl lying next to her. She smiled softly and  propped herself on her elbows to watch her for a while. Quistis was  back, she though ecstatically. She was really alive and well again.  And most of all, they loved each other. It was a thought that sent Xu  nearly squealing with joy. Instead, she sighed and realized that she  was not very well “organized.” This merely meant that she needed  to shower and change…badly. She got out of the bed slowly, for fear  of waking Quistis up. It happened anyway.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Xu?” Quistis  mumbled.</p>
<p>“Go back to sleep.  I’m just getting a shower and getting changed, ok?” Xu replied.  She bent down and gave Quistis a quick kiss on the forehead. She  smiled sleepily and contently, like a small child before crashing  down on the pillow and falling back asleep. Xu giggled a little and  stepped out, softly closing the door.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Selphie hummed a  little as she skipped down the hallways, earning rather odd looks  from the teachers. Usually no one was up this early but she was just  so excited to see her friend again. Everyone was ok and she was more  than happy to spread her cheeriness around. It was, after all,  infectious as Irvine put it. The only thing that could possibly make  things better would be if a certain cowboy stopped chasing women and  asked her out. (A/N: In my story, the have not gotten together yet.)  She was so oblivious that she nearly ran into Xu when she turned the  corner.</p>
<p>“OH!” She said,  jumping back. “I’m sorry, I didn’t see you there…”</p>
<p>“Hi…” Xu said,  guardedly. “What are you doing up so early?”<br />
  “Just going  over to visit Quistis. How is she?”<br />
  “She’s fine…” She  replied, a little jealous before remember that Quistis was <em>hers</em>.  She smiled and her mood changed completely. “She’s still asleep  so I wouldn’t suggest waking her up. But she ought to be up by the  time I get back otherwise I’ll make her get up.”<br />
  “Ok!”  Selphie smiled before continuing her humming and skipping. As soon as  she entered the infirmary, she turned and greeted Dr. Kadowaki.  “Morning Dr. K!”</p>
<p>“Dr. Kadowaki,  Selphie. And good morning to you.” The doctor replied  automatically. She had gotten used to the nickname, no matter how  much she hated it. She calmly sipped tea and read the morning  newspaper, the <u>Balamb Tribune</u>. She wasn’t really paying  attention to the little bundle of energy with brown bouncy hair.</p>
<p>“So, how’s Quistis  today?” Unconsciously, a smile crept up the doctor’s face and  Selphie wondered what she was smiling about.</p>
<p>“Quistis is fine,  especially now that she’s got a special certain someone…” Dr.  Kadowaki froze and the words she had said automatically sunk in. Her  eyes widened in shock and she slowly turned around, preparing herself  for what Armageddon she had just unleashed upon the world. Selphie’s  eyes were wide to and a gigantic smile formed on her face. Dr.  Kadowaki, knowing what was coming next, plugged her ears.</p>
<p>“WWWWHHHHAAATTT??!!”</p>
<p>“Selphie, please,  there are other pati…”</p>
<p>“WHO WHAT WHERE WHEN  HOW??!!” Selphie did an impossible jump over the desk, scrambling  over to Dr. Kadowaki’s side.</p>
<p>“Selphie! Be quiet!”  She hissed. The petit girl giggled.</p>
<p>“Dr. K! Spill the  beans!”</p>
<p>“Selphie…listen,  this isn’t something I can discuss. Quistis deserves her privacy  and besides, it’s complicated…” Selphie’s eyes widened in  shock.</p>
<p>“Complicated? Oh no!  Is she having an affair?!” She asked in shock.</p>
<p>“NO! She’s just…”</p>
<p>“PREGNANT?! OH MY  HYNE!!” She shrieked. “You didn’t tell me this!!”</p>
<p>“SELPHIE!! WOULD YOU  PLEASE LISTEN TO ME!”</p>
<p>“Would either of you  be kind enough to keep it down?” Quistis mumbled as she stepped out  of the door. As soon as she appeared, the girl at Dr. Kadowaki’s  side was gone and appeared almost miraculously by the young  instructor.</p>
<p>“Quistis!  Congratulations! Is it a boy or a girl?” Quistis looked over at Dr.  Kadowaki who shot her an apologetic look.</p>
<p>“What are you  talking about?”</p>
<p>“Dr. K told me that  you’re having an affair with a student and you’re pregnant!”  The blonde’s eyes shot open with shock.</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>“What is right.”  Xu said, leaning against the wall with a smile on her face akin to  that of a cat who had just stolen milk from the milkman.</p>
<p>“Xu! Did you hear?!  Quistis is having an affair with Squall and apparently they’re  going to have twins!” Quistis groaned. The lie was getting larger  and larger.</p>
<p>“Selphie! WOULD YOU  PLEASE SHUT UP!” She yelled. “I am NOT having an affair with  Squall. I am NOT pregnant. And if I hear anyone in the Garden saying  anything even remotely similar…” She trailed off, feeling more  tired than angry all of a sudden. Xu looked at her with concerned  eyes.<br />
  “You ok?” She asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah…just getting  a little light headed.” Xu frowned and went over to steady her.</p>
<p>“She needs rest.”  Xu said, asking Selphie to leave. Selphie pouted but then lightened  up again.</p>
<p>“Ok, I’ll be back  later and you’re going to tell me everything about this mystery  man, ok?” She waved and ran off, leaving a cloud of dust. Dr.  Kadowaki sighed and shook her head.</p>
<p>“She’s a special  child, isn’t she?” The doctor asked. Quistis smiled.</p>
<p>“You get used to it  after a while.”</p>
<p>“What I’m curious  is how she got that Quistis was in an affair.” Xu questioned,  looking slyly over at Dr. Kadowaki.</p>
<p>“What can I say? I’m  happy for you two. You’ve been best friends for a while…and  you’ve only gotten closer these past few days.”</p>
<p>“You know?”  Quistis asked. The doctor nodded, a slight blush creeping up her  cheeks.</p>
<p>“I, uh, might’ve  accidentally walked in on the night that Quistis woke up…it was a  little awkward at first.” She scratched her head and smiled. “But  this is the happiest I’ve seen Quistis in a while…”</p>
<p>“Please, don’t  tell anyone yet.” Xu pleaded. Quistis looked at her.</p>
<p>“Why not? This is  supposed to something good.” She asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what  this’ll do for your reputation. I just don’t want you getting  fired for something like this or people hurting you or saying stuff.  I just don’t want that.” Quistis smiled softly.</p>
<p>“I don’t care.”</p>
<p>“I do.” Xu said.  “So please…” There was a shaky tone in Xu’s voice that made  Quistis feel as though she were afraid of something.</p>
<p>“Is everything  alright.” She asked. Xu nodded quietly but both knew that there was  something else.</p>
<p>“Ok.” She agreed  and Xu let out a relieved sigh.</p>
<p>“Let’s get you  back into bed, ok? You still look like you’re about to collapse…”  She said, avoiding the subject. Quistis gave her a somewhat pained  look for keeping something from her but she quickly got over it. <em>Idiot, did you really expect her to tell you everything?  Especially something that might be really painful for her?</em> She  thought angrily. Together, they walked back into the room. Dr.  Kadowaki smiled softly at them, feeling more relieved than ever that  Quistis had finally found someone and vice versa. Xu…she remembered  when that girl first came to the Balamb Garden.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p><em>“Everything in  order?” A guard asked. The young cadet nodded and saluted.</em></p>
<p><em>“Sir, no  abnormalities.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I say there  are.” The old man from the gate hobbled towards them. The Garden  Staff walked over to him.</em></p>
<p><em>“What do you  mean?”</em></p>
<p><em>“There’s a  young girl who collapsed outside. My old body can’t handle bringing  her here. Why don’t one of you young un’s go help her?” The  young cadet looked to the Garden staff for an order.</em></p>
<p><em>“Get to it.”  The young cadet saluted. “Take her to the infirmary.” After a  moment, the cadet came back, looking rather frightfully at the  bleeding and all but mutilated body in rags. With a pale face, he ran  to the infirmary.</em></p>
<p><em>“Dr. Kadowaki!”  He shouted. She looked over and gasped.</em></p>
<p><em>“Goodness!  Quickly, lay her down!” The cadet all but dropped her, wanting to  get her body away as fast as possible, not able to withstand the  sight of a child in such a condition.</em></p>
<p><em>“Becca…” Xu  whispered, huddling further into her rags. “Becca…Becca…come  back…” Dr. Kadowaki heard but she had no time to waste, the girl  was dying.</em></p>
<p><em>-</em></p>
<p><em>When Xu awoke, she  saw the face of Rebecca looming over her. She tried to reach for it  but she couldn’t move any part of her body. Even her eyes were too  heavy.</em></p>
<p><em>“Becca…” She  wanted to say but it never exited her mind.</em></p>
<p><em>“How are you  feeling?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Fine…” She  thought as the room cleared. It turned out, it wasn’t her friend,  instead, Dr. Kadowaki’s face appeared. She looked up with empty  eyes at her savior but was unable to feel any joy in knowing that she  was safe but alone.</em></p>
<p><em>“You’re ok now.  You’re in the Balamb Garden. Where are your parents?”</em></p>
<p><em>“I wanna be with  Becca. I don’t feel safe here. I don’t want to be here. I wanna  be with Becca…” She got the energy to look around. “Where is  she?” And that’s when the memories returned.</em></p>
<p><em>A single piercing  scream tore through the garden.</em></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“Xu…”</p>
<p>“You want to know  what happened, right?” She sighed.</p>
<p>“A little.”  Quistis admitted. Xu wrapped her arms around her body and sat down  with her back against Quistis. The Instructor looked sadly and put  her arms around her waist, hugging her. “You don’t have to.”</p>
<p>“I just don’t want  to remember what happened to Becca.” She whispered. Quistis kissed  the back of her neck.</p>
<p>“Then don’t.” Xu  shuddered and shook with tears. “I don’t want to call you any  unnecessary pain.”</p>
<p>“Becca was the only  one who stood up for me back then.” She blurted. “I’m sorry…I  think I do need to tell someone. Well, you see, she…” She  couldn’t continue. Her throat locked up and she felt sick all of a  sudden. Images of the assailants attacking, no, <em>brutalizing</em> her heroine flooded her mind.</p>
<p>“It’s ok…”  Quistis’s voice brought her back. “Xu…Xu come back to me.”  She sighed and brushed back her hair, shaken but ok.</p>
<p>“I’m going to go  get that breakfast I promised, ok? What do you want?” Xu asked,  standing up.</p>
<p>“Just some pancakes  please.” Quistis said cautiously. She gave her a soft kiss on the  forehead and Xu left the room, leaving Quistis wondering what went  wrong back before she knew Xu. They had known each other since they  were little. She tried to remember if anyone ever told her how Xu  came to the Garden since she was here long before she and the other  orphans were. But she couldn’t remember if anyone mentioned it to  her. Xu was always there…always had been. She sighed and leaned  back on the pillows.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>It wasn’t long  before Xu was ambushed by an overly ecstatic Rinoa and Selphie. Ayane  tagged alone though less interested in invading people’s privacy.</p>
<p>“YOU!!” The two  shouted at the top of their lungs.</p>
<p>“Me?” Xu replied,  surprised.</p>
<p>“YES YOU!” They  were at her side in milliseconds. “YOU KNOW WHAT’S UP WITH  QUISTIS!! SPILL!!” Xu looked at Ayane pleadingly.</p>
<p>“I tried to stop  them, I really did.” She said, shaking her head. “But they were  so insistent.</p>
<p>“TELL!!” They  squeaked over and over again. “WHO’S QUISTIS’S BOYFRIEND??!”  Xu was getting a headache.</p>
<p>“Keep your voices  down. You’re drawing stares.” She ordered. They covered their  mouths but their eyes were wide as ever. “Quistis doesn’t have a  boyfriend.”</p>
<p>“Liar.” Selphie  whispered.</p>
<p>“Excuse me? Are you  calling a superior a liar?” Ayane took a step back, sensing that Xu  was certainly not in the mood to jest.</p>
<p>“Uh…guys…you’re  flirting with death there…” She laughed nervously. The two didn’t  seem to mind so much.</p>
<p>“I’m calling you,  as a friend, a liar. Not a superior. I know you know something that  we don’t know.” Selphie retorted.</p>
<p>“That’s down on  SeeD rank.” Xu snapped.</p>
<p>“Fine! I’m still  going to nag. I don’t care if you demote me to cadet.” Xu raised  an eyebrow and Selphie looked on with equal determination. Somehow,  Xu couldn’t bring herself to do anything.</p>
<p>“Look, I’m tired  and this isn’t helping.” She said tiredly. “Quistis will tell  you when she’s ready. I need to go get her breakfast before it  becomes lunch.” She pushed past the two. They watched her go down  the hall into the cafeteria.</p>
<p>“She’s no fun…”  Rinoa pouted. “It’s not like we would tell any…” She caught  Ayane’s look of contempt. “Well…only our friends.”</p>
<p>“Your ‘friends’  range from Trepe to janitor, Rin.” Ayane replied. “Everyone in  the Garden’s your friend.” She frowned.</p>
<p>“We’ll pry it out  of her eventually.” Selphie promised.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The door to the  infirmary opened again and Quistis looked up to see Xu carrying a  tray of pancakes, still steaming.</p>
<p>“Hey.” She said,  setting the tray down on the table.</p>
<p>“Mm…smells good.”  Quistis replied.</p>
<p>“We have to do  something special when you get back on your feet.” Quistis eyed her  suggestively, causing her to blush fiercely. “Something along the  lines of…uh…dinner.” It was embarrassing how she could get so  tongue tied at one look. Quistis laughed merrily.</p>
<p>“Dinner sounds  great.” She said, leaning over and kissing her on the cheek.</p>
<p>“Don’t do that to  me!” Xu said crossly. The idea had crossed her head but she  dismissed it with a vengeance. “I swear you’re going to be the  end of me.”</p>
<p>“Well, so long as  it’s not someone else who’s going to be the end of you.”  Quistis giggled and settled down to eat.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“Excuse me, have you  seen the Balamb Garden?”</p>
<p>“Sorry ma’am, the  Balamb Garden passed through here a few days ago.” An old fisherman  replied. The young lady looked at the ground, disappointed.</p>
<p>“Do you know which  direction they went in?”</p>
<p>“Northwest, I  think.”</p>
<p>“Thank you sir.” <em>I  must warn Xu, before it’s too late…</em></p>
