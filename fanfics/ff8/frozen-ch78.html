It&#39;s late, well after midnight I suppose. The wedding was a success, 
Squall to Rinoa, Selphie to Irvine, a joyous affair to be certain. The 
sound of their laughter echoes in the dance hall, and yet it pains me. I 
should be happy for them, and in a way I guess I am. But what about us, 
We deserved such happiness, you deserved such happiness. Perhaps I 
should leave this place, leave everything behind, until we are together 
again. I miss you; I miss the sound of your voice, the gentle touch of 
your hands, the love you&#39;ve given me during our short time together.

Squall and the others, they tell me that everything will be okay. They 
do it out of pity I suppose, damn them. Not that it matters though, I&#39;m 
still alone and you are gone. You didn&#39;t deserve this, it&#146;s not right 
and it&#39;s not fair. Whenever I walk the halls, people point and stare, 
more so now than when you walked beside me. Their hushed whispers of 
remorse and pity assail my ears like restless spirits. None ever speak 
to my face though, thinking it best to leave me to my misery and I 
prefer it that way.

Once, I was acknowledged at least, but now I&#39;m like a bad memory, 
existing but ignored. I&#39;ve come so far only to become a reminder of all 
the pain we&#39;ve all had to endure and I can&#39;t help but hate them for it.

True, those closest to me have tried to help, but what can they do? I 
still can&#39;t believe you left me behind. After all we&#146;ve been through 
together. We were one. No, that is selfish of me, I know you&#39;re still 
with me, I have to believe that, I have to believe that.

&quot;Faith, I don&#39;t know if I have any...&quot;

Now though, because of you, and all you&#39;ve thought me. I can allow 
myself to hope.

&quot;I wonder what will become of me...?&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter I realize, so long as you&#39;re in my heart.&quot;

I take a breath and the cold air stings my lungs. Leaning on the 
railing, I watch the frozen landscape drift beneath me. Fully restored, 
Balamb Garden drifted quietly over the snow-covered fields, north of 
Esthar. It&#39;s a beautiful sight, the ice sparkling like a sea of gems 
under the Garden&#39;s lights.

&quot;Alone&quot; My thoughts race back to that again.

&quot;I&#39;m strong, I can go on without you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a lie, I need you... more than ever...&quot;

****************************

The vows said and the ceremonies completed. The newlyweds as well as 
their guests now tended to the simple matter of celebration. It was 
somewhat late into the evening when the brides remembered to toss their 
bouquets.

Rinoa and Selphie standing side by side, gigged madly as a swarm of 
eligible young women swarmed behind them. In unison, the two women threw 
their bouquets over their shoulder. Considering that the majority of the 
girls had already had a few drinks by this time, it was of little 
surprise when chaos ensued. When the dust settled one young woman from 
Trabia held aloft one mangled bouquet, while Celest fiercely claimed the 
other.

&quot;Yahoo!&quot; She shouted loudly, dancing victoriously.

&quot;Now why doesn&#39;t that surprise me.&quot; Irvine sighed, hiding his face 
behind his hand.

&quot;Yup, she&#39;s your kin.&quot; Zell said in a hayseed accent.

The two men stood nearby watching the festivities as several guests 
began to retire for the evening.

&quot;Party is dying down.&quot; Laguna noted. He was slightly flush and Ward and 
Kiros stood nearby making sure their noted and renown president didn&#39;t 
make a fool of himself while drinking.

&quot;Looks like it.&quot; Squall sighed. Looking about.

Celest skipped over merrily with bouquet in hand. Rinoa and Selphie were 
following behind her, still giggling madly at each other.

&quot;This looks like trouble.&quot; Irvine mumbled.

&quot;Well boys it&#39;s you&#39;re turn.&quot; Celest said saucily.

&quot;Huh...?&quot; Zell questioned.

&quot;Here we go.&quot; Irvine sighed. &quot;Celest what are you doing?&quot;

&quot;Boys! Gather around!&quot; Celest hollered, getting the remaining guests 
attention. Sure enough, the majority of the men moved in curiously.

&quot;Um what are you doing.&quot; Rinoa said worriedly.

Celest answered her by leaning over to grab at her dress.

&quot;Hey let go of me!&quot; Rinoa screeched in surprise.

&quot;Time to toss the garter! Hey Squall come here!&quot; Celest giggled, trying 
to hike up the other woman&#39;s dress.

&quot;What the hell are you doin!&quot; Squall blurted, moving forward.

&quot;It&#39;s tradition, calm down.&quot; Cid laughed. &quot;Celest, I think Rinoa can 
handle that herself.&quot;

&quot;Sure thing Cidney.&quot; Celest giggled, tossing him a salute.

&quot;Cidney...&quot; Cid mouthed, as if saying it tasted bad.

&quot;She&#39;s drunk.&quot; Zell pointed out.

&quot;You think.&quot; Nicole grinned, pushing through the crowd to see what the 
fuss was about.

&quot;You&#39;re all insane.&quot; Rinoa huffed. &quot;I was wondering why you had us wear 
those.&quot;

&quot;Oh live a little.&quot; Selphie giggled, sitting down in the floor and 
raising her leg. &quot;Irvy poo, would you mind.&quot;

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Rinoa paled.

Zone exploded into nervous laughter as Irvine walked forward with a 
shrug.

&quot;I wish I had a camera.&quot; Zell grinned.

Answering his request, Nicole whipped out a camcorder as Irvine knelt to 
slide the garter off Selphie&#39;s thigh.

&quot;Well son, go to it.&quot; Laguna chuckled, clapping Squall on the back.

&quot;Hey!?&quot; Squall grumbled.

&quot;This is silly.&quot; Rinoa sighed, propping her leg up a chair and raising 
her dress.

&quot;You&#39;re telling me.&quot; Squall mumbled as he walked forward, blushing 
profusely. He looked down at Rinoa&#39;s leg and gulped.

&quot;Well go on silly, everyone is staring.&quot; Rinoa prodded.

&quot;That&#146;s the problem.&quot; Squall said nervously.

&quot;Oh quit being a stick in the mud!&quot; Selphie shouted.

&quot;I&#39;ll do it!&quot; Zell shouted before being belted by Nicole.

&quot;I think I can handle it.&quot; Squall shot back. Without further fuss he 
leaned forward and carefully slipped the garter loose.

&quot;Okay now what.&quot; He asked, holding it up.

&quot;Ya do this.&quot; Irvine chuckled, firing his garter into the air like a 
slingshot.

Men scrambled in a mad dash, elbowing and shoving each other out of the 
way. Squall&#39;s eyes went wide at the display.

&quot;Wait for me!&quot; Zell laughed, and jumped into the dog pile.

&quot;This is stupid.&quot; Squall groaned and just tossed the garter to Zone who 
just happened to be nearby. Looking down at his prize, Zone made a 
nervous gurgling noise before shuffling off in a daze.

&quot;Oh, dear....&quot; Watts sighed, rubbing his brow in worry.

&quot;Great, that&#39;s just great!&quot; Rinoa said, punching Squall in the arm. 
&quot;He&#39;s been after my underwear since we were in middle school and you 
just give it to him!&quot; She blurted, punching him again.

&quot;How was I supposed to know that!?&quot; Squall shirked, moving out of arms 
reach.

&quot;Hyne this is great.&quot; Zell sighed, throwing an arm around Nicole, who 
leaned against him snugly.

&quot;Yeah it is.&quot; She smiled watching the fiasco unfold.

&quot;Quistis and Fujin should be here.&quot; Xu said quietly, standing nearby, 
watching Nida make a proper fool out of himself trying to get Selphie&#39;s 
garter. Cid moved towards her and coughed slightly to get her attention.

&quot;Huh?&quot; She said, looking curiously. Cid simply pointed towards the 
balcony, where a silhouette could be seen outside.

&quot;Oh wow, she came...&quot; Xu breathed, a soft smile playing across her lips. 
&quot;When?&quot; She asked, watching the figure.

&quot;She arrived after the ceremony started, she was sitting in the back, 
away from everyone.&quot; Cid answered as a look of sorrow crossed his face.

&quot;Poor thing, it must have been hard...&quot; Xu frowned.

&quot;I know, I&#39;m glad she came, I was worried that she wouldn&#39;t&quot;

&quot;Me too... Have you talked to her, does anyone else know?&quot;

&quot;Just Rinoa and Selphie, I figured they&#39;d be happy to know she came. I 
didn&#39;t want to tell anyone else so they wouldn&#39;t trouble her. As for 
talking to her....&quot; Cid said quietly. &quot;She hasn&#39;t talked to anyone since 
going berserk when we found them.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t remind me.... That was horrible, poor thing....&quot; Xu sniffed, her 
expression tightening as she pushed away the memory. &quot;I&#39;m um...going to 
go talk to her...&quot; She said quietly. Cid didn&#39;t protest and nodded 
knowingly.

&quot;Be careful, don&#39;t upset her, but do, give her my best.&quot; He called out 
as Xu made her way towards the balcony.

Opening the glass door she gasped as the cold air stole her breath. She 
was surprised to find herself alone and nearly thought the worst.

&quot;Oh, no.&quot; She mumbled in fright, hurrying to the edge of the balcony.

She sensed a presence behind her and she spun around to see someone in 
the shadows.

&quot;Hyne...&quot; She gasped, putting a hand on her chest. &quot;You scared me to 
death... I thought...&quot; She thought it best not to finish the statement. 
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; No response was forthcoming and Xu moved closer.

&quot;Everyone&#39;s glad you came. I mean, I know it must&#39;ve been hard on you.&quot;

The figure moved forward and regarded her with a dark and weary gaze.

&quot;Oh...look at you.&quot; Xu said quietly, feeling tears begin to swell. &quot;You 
look like haven&#39;t slept in weeks. You can&#39;t keep secluding yourself like 
this...&quot;

&quot;leave me...&quot; The figure whispered in a tone so cold and quiet it 
could&#39;ve been whispered by a ghost.

&quot;I figured you&#39;d say that...&quot; Xu sighed, wiping her eyes. &quot;But damn it, 
I&#39;m not going to. You need help. I know you&#39;re hurting hon, we all are, 
but you don&#39;t have to suffer alone. You can&#39;t keep this up; you&#39;re 
killing yourself...&quot; She said in exasperation then frowned gravely. 
&quot;Unless that&#146;s what you want....&quot; She added in a dark tone. Again no 
response was forthcoming; not that she needed one.

&quot;You can&#39;t give up. It&#39;s not fair to you, it&#39;s not fair to us and it 
sure as hell isn&#39;t fair to her!&quot; Xu proclaimed, jabbing a finger into 
the other woman&#39;s chest. Her companion said nothing but simply turned 
and left at a brisk pace. Zell and Nicole noticed Xu go outside and went 
to investigate only to be nearly bowled over as Xu and her companion 
rushed from the balcony.

&quot;Oh hey, you came!&quot; Zell shouted cheerfully, smiling broadly only to be 
ignored.

&quot;Hey...&quot; He murmured sadly as Nicole put an arm around his slumped 
shoulders.

&quot;She didn&#39;t mean it hon.&quot; Nicole whispered, hugging him.

&quot;I know. Still, that&#146;s awfully cold.&quot; He sighed.

Xu gave up the chase and turned to look at Zell regretfully.

&quot;It&#39;ll be okay. She&#39;ll come around.&quot; She offered with in a somewhat 
unconvincing tone.

&quot;I hope you&#39;re right...&quot; He mumbled quietly.

*******************

The apartment was a lonely place, rushing in she shut the door and fell 
against it sobbing quietly. Reduced to nothing more than a lost, 
frightened little girl. She hated herself. Hated her self for falling 
apart when she needed strength the most.

&quot;come back to me...&quot; She whispered between choking, burning tears.

Though time had passed, the wounds still burned as vividly as ever. She 
felt shame, shame at how she&#39;d fallen apart.

&quot;What would you think if you saw me now....&quot; She wondered to herself.

Pulling herself to her feet, she got undressed and staggered to the 
bedroom and fell atop the bed, tears still wet, on her face. She lay 
there, for a long while, letting herself remember when the two of them 
shared the bed, remembering the comforting warmth of her body next to 
hers.

&quot;You&#39;ve things to do...Stop torturing yourself.&quot; She scolded herself 
mentally.

Sniffing lightly she sat up and took a calming breath as she tried to 
focus her mind once more. &quot;Yes, things to do...&quot;

******************

&quot;Thanks for letting me fly you guys out.&quot; Zell said cheerfully as he led 
the newlyweds into the hanger.

&quot;No choice.&quot; Squall shrugged. &quot;You&#39;re the only one who hasn&#39;t been 
drinking tonight.&quot;

&quot;Yeah well, you know what I say.&quot;

&quot;My body is a temple.&quot; Selphie and Irvine said in mocking unison.

&quot;Hey, lay off it.&quot; Zell grumbled, hitting the panel that lowered the 
Ragnarok&#39;s gangplank.

&quot;I heard about your run in earlier.&quot; Rinoa said quietly to Zell as they 
made their way inside the ship. &quot;She didn&#39;t mean to be so rude.&quot;

&quot;I know, I know, I understand, really.&quot; Zell assured her with a smile. 
&quot;Anyway, back to happier things. I bet you guys are happy excited about 
going on your honeymoons.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t wait to get back to Deling City, it&#39;s marvelous in the winter.&quot; 
Irvine crowed. &quot;Not that I plan to leave the hotel much.&quot; He winked.

&quot;Oh no.&quot; Selphie scowled, shaking her head. &quot;Little late for that, and 
it&#39;s that kind of thinking that got me like this!&quot;

&quot;I was kidding.&quot; Irvine blurted, throwing up his hands.

Squall blushed and shook his head.

&quot;I can&#39;t wait personally.&quot; Rinoa giggled, throwing her arms around 
Squall and kissing him passionately, causing him to blush further.

&quot;Hey, hey, hey!&quot; Zell shouted, covering his eyes. &quot;Save that stuff for 
the resort, sheesh.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure going into space is a good idea?&quot; Selphie asked, looking 
skeptically at Rinoa. &quot;I mean it&#39;s not to late to change your mind, the 
hotel has plenty of vacancies, that and the theater troupes are in town. 
Lots of big shows and famous plays to see!&quot;

&quot;Ellone said the new orbital resort is amazing. Besides, I&#39;d like to go 
back up there and see the stars without some lunatic in my head.&quot;

&quot;Like that changed anything...&quot; Squall mumbled into his palm.

&quot;It think we&#39;ll have fun.&quot; Rinoa finished, then popped Squall in the 
back of the head.

***********************

It was the wee hours of the morning when the piercing ring of her pager 
woke Xu out of her party induced slumber. Nida too sat up blurry eyed 
and wild looking, the evening, having not been kind to his hair.

&quot;Who the hell is beeping...&quot; Nida grumbled.

&quot;It&#39;s me...&quot; Xu sighed. She&#39;d been left in charge of things while Squall 
was away.

&quot;Good.&quot; Nida grumbled then crashed back into his pillow.

&quot;Ass.&quot; Xu sighed, shoving him slightly as she slipped out of bed. She 
danced about cursing under her breath the moment her feet hit the cold 
floor.

After making her way to the phone, she dialed the emergency number to 
the bridge.

&quot;What!&quot; She asked sourly when the line connected. &quot;What!? Who!? Damn it, 
okay, I&#39;ll be right there?&quot; She sputtered angrily, hanging up the phone.

&quot;Guess who is demanding we land so that they can come aboard?&quot; She said 
sourly to Nida who was snoring blissfully.

&quot;Don&#39;t care...&quot; He mumbled, waking slightly.

&quot;Seifer...&quot;

&quot;Sucks to be you.&quot; He chuckled, burying his head under the pillows.

********************

&quot;Put that thing away kid before I whip you with it.&quot; Seifer growled at 
the security guard pointing a rifle at him.

&quot;At ease...&quot; Xu called out as she made her way into the dock. She had 
agreed to land Balamb long enough to hear him out, however she wasn&#39;t 
about to let him cause trouble, especially this late at night.

&quot;Nice robe.&quot; Seifer snorted, nodding to the sandals and indigo housecoat 
Xu sported.

&quot;Thank you, and I sincerely hope you didn&#39;t come here just to say that. 
If so, I&#39;ll be sorely disappointed.&quot;

&quot;You know why I&#39;m here.&quot;

&quot;Yes I do, and that&#146;s why I&#39;m not letting you pass. I don&#39;t need you 
stirring up bad memories, especially not now.&quot;

&quot;I should have been here, I could have stopped this.&quot; Seifer frowned.

&quot;Perhaps, perhaps not, no use driving yourself crazy thinking about it. 
Look at you, you look like shit. Is this how you were going to make 
amends.&quot;

&quot;This isn&#39;t about me. I&#39;m not important anymore.&quot;

&quot;Damn right.&quot;

&quot;This, lets hate Seifer routine is getting old. Are you going to let me 
by or not?&quot;

&quot;Its late Seifer, everyone is tired from the wedding...Look, I&#39;ll give 
you a room, and we can talk about in the morning.&quot;

&quot;Wedding?&quot; Seifer blinked.

&quot;Yeah, Rinoa and Squall, Selphie and Irvine. Look, don&#39;t cause trouble 
tonight and I may let you talk to her. Not that it&#39;d do any good. She 
won&#39;t talk to anyone. Besides, what would you have her say?&quot;

&quot;Hold on.&quot; Seifer paused. &quot;Married?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;No invitation huh.&quot; He frowned.

&quot;Not that I know of.&quot;

&quot;Oh well.&quot; He shrugged, running a hand through his grungy hair. &quot;Fine, 
give me a room, I&#39;ll wait until morning. I could use a bath anyway.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah you could.&quot; Xu huffed, gesturing him to follow.

**********************

She had just prepared to leave the apartment when a knock sounded. It 
startled her, it was very late, and most everyone should&#39;ve long been 
asleep. With a heavy sigh she looked down and shook her head.

&quot;Why won&#39;t they leave me alone?&quot;

Taking a deep breath to steady herself she went to the door. After 
pausing a moment she pulled the door open. Who she saw made her 
shoulders slump; she didn&#39;t have the strength to deal with him now. 
Seifer had little trouble sneaking out after Xu left him, he overpowered 
the guards and was prepared to face any challenge but nothing prepared 
him for what he saw. He stood silently a moment seemingly in shock at 
seeing her so gaunt and hollow. With a look of disgust, she moved to 
shut the door in his face, only to have him stop her. He was surprised 
at how easy it was to push her back as he made his way inside. Shutting 
the door behind him, he regarded her sadly.

&quot;Fu...&quot; He whispered.</pre>
