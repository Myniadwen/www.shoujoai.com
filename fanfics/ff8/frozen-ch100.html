Bodies moving, hot, impassioned, with rhythms as old as time immortal. 
Intimate caresses, a swirl of sensations all electric, sensual, 
delicate, forceful, maddening and intense. Resting now, they float 
together amid the dull glow of the stars, sweat glistening on their skin 
while soft breathes escape their lips. Fujin, Quistis, entwined, 
complete, spent. Lazily, Quistis opened her eyes and gazed out into the 
heavens.

&quot;I don&#146;t want to go back...&quot; She thought solemnly.

&quot;Then don&#146;t.&quot; Fujin responded wordlessly, looking up into her eyes, 
their minds linked.

Quistis smirked warmly and cradled her to close.

&quot;I think I could get used to this.&quot;

&quot;I know...&quot; Fujin purred softly, hugging her tightly.

&quot;Oh, now you&#146;re impressed.&quot; Quistis frowned playfully.

&quot;Is impressive, but aren&#146;t you worried?&quot; Fujin asked curiously, still 
having trouble making her thoughts into functional sentences instead of 
the clipped speech she normally used.

&quot;Not really, I see it as a blessing.&quot; Quistis responded aloud, then 
rubbed her temples.

&quot;SEE.&quot; Fujin scolded her. &quot;STRAIN.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s hard work, I need to practice anyway.&quot;

&quot;TELEPATHY, TELE... TELEKIN....&quot; Fujin started then growled in 
annoyance.

&quot;Telekinesis.&quot; Quistis smiled sympathetically. &quot;What about it?&quot;

&quot;WORRIED, BIG CHANGES.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t be.&quot; Quistis spoke silently into Fujin&#146;s mind causing her to jump 
slightly.

&quot;GETTING USED TOO.&quot; She grinned nervously.

&quot;I know, weird isn&#146;t it?&quot;

&quot;CAN READ?&quot;

&quot;Pardon?&quot;

&quot;MINDS.&quot;

&quot;I dunno.&quot;

&quot;TRY.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;CURIOUS.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot; Quistis giggled, then focused on her, brows knitting together in 
an amusing furrow.

&quot;BE SERIOUS.&quot; Fujin sighed, grinning.

&quot;Okay, okay...&quot; Quistis laughed, then concentrated. A brief flash of her 
eyes signaled her blue magic&#146;s activation. &quot;Are you sure you want me to 
try this? I mean what if I dig up some kind of dirty secret.&quot;

&quot;NONSENSE.&quot; Fujin huffed.

&quot;All right, serious, okay I can do this...&quot; Quistis smiled, this time 
really concentrating. Fujin felt a tingle in the back of her mind, 
something similar to the unusual but familiar sensation of their 
previous connection. Quistis&#146; face crewed up into one of concentration a 
moment then she gasped as if she&#146;d been holding her breath.

&quot;WELL?&quot; Fujin asked curiously.

&quot;Yams?&quot;

&quot;NO.&quot;

&quot;Ugh...&quot; Quistis sighed in defeat then shrugged impassively.

&quot;OKAY?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, told you, I&#146;m new to this.&quot;

&quot;COULD BE TROUBLE.&quot;

&quot;Yeah I know.&quot;

&quot;PEOPLE DISTRUST.&quot;

&quot;No more than usual, it&#146;s really no different than a sorceress&#146; power, 
very similar in fact, if what Edea said was true...&quot;

&quot;THAT&#146;S POINT.&quot; Fujin frowned, then tossed her head slightly, moving her 
drifting hair from her face.

Unaware that they were floating backwards Quistis yelped as her back 
bumped into the cool, padded walls.

&quot;Ack cold, cold, cold.&quot; She whined, twisting in mid air. Fujin chuckled 
quietly at the site and pushed towards a small remote that drifted 
nearby.

Tapping lightly on the buttons, a soft hum filled the room and the two 
women where gently drawn to the floor as the gravity system returned.

 A buzz sounded in the air, signaling someone at the front door. Quistis 
groused a moment then grabbed her housecoat before padding along the 
carpeted hallway and down the stairs to the front hall. Peering through 
the peephole she giggled at the fish eyed view of Naomi smiling widely 
up at her. It had been three days since the awkward offer by Ayane. 
Thankfully, nothing more was said of it, though in the days that 
followed, Quistis still noted the occasional hungry glance from Naomi.

&quot;WHO?&quot; Fujin asked, from atop the stairs, where she finished buttoning 
up a long dress shirt she&#146;d borrowed from Quistis.

&quot;Naomi.&quot; Quistis answered then opened the door.

&quot;Quisty!&quot; The girl beamed.

&quot;Um hi.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m sad.&quot; Naomi stated evenly, as if demanding someone to make her feel 
better.

&quot;Odd, you don&#146;t look it.&quot; Quistis smirked, motioning for her to enter.

&quot;You guys are leaving.&quot;

&quot;In a few hours.&quot;

&quot;That just plain and simply will not do.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, vacations over.&quot; Quistis laughed, shutting the door.

&quot;NAOMI.&quot; Fujin nodded casually as she walked past and into the kitchen.

&quot;Fuji!&quot; Naomi waved in eager response.

Fujin bristled but kept quiet, not wanting to encourage more 
interaction.

&quot;Please don&#146;t antagonize her; she&#146;s in a good mood for once.&quot; Quistis 
said quietly.

&quot;HEAR YOU!&quot; Fujin barked, while rummaging through the spacious 
refrigerator.

Quistis tossed her a glance then turned back towards her guest.

&quot;Where&#146;s Ayane?&quot;

&quot;Sleeping in, she was out partying last night.&quot;

&quot;You weren&#146;t with her?&quot;

&quot;I can&#146;t dance and I don&#146;t like drinking.&quot;

&quot;COULD FOOL ME.&quot; Fujin grumbled, walking past them with an armful of 
munchies and a large water bottle.

&quot;Anyway.&quot; Naomi grinned, leaning slightly to watch her walk away. 
Quistis soured visibly and shifted to block her view. &quot;Anyway.&quot; Naomi 
continued, quickly meeting Quistis gaze. &quot;We&#146;re leaving soon ourselves, 
so I don&#146;t think I&#146;ll get a chance to say bye later.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s too bad? Where are you going?&quot;

&quot;My dad wants me in Esthar to help with some business stuff.&quot;

&quot;Well, that&#146;s no good. You guys will have to come to Balamb to visit. 
I&#146;d like that a lot. So would Fujin.&quot; Quistis smiled, hearing a 
dissatisfied grunt somewhere in the distance.

&quot;She doesn&#146;t like me much does she?&quot;

&quot;She does, she just doesn&#146;t like showing it.&quot;

&quot;Did you ever tell her about...?&quot;

&quot;Yes, she&#146;s hard to keep secrets from.&quot;

&quot;Well?&quot;

&quot;She about had a fit to be honest, but I calmed her down.&quot;

&quot;Ew really, I&#146;m sorry about all of that. I feel like an idiot.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s okay, no harm done, besides, I found it flattering, and though 
she&#146;d never admit it, I think Fujin did too.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for being understanding.&quot;

&quot;I try.&quot; Quistis smiled softly.

&quot;Well I&#146;ve got to run; you guys have a safe trip home.&quot; Naomi said with 
wistful regret then waved towards the den, where Fujin could be seen 
sitting in the floor with what looked like a jumbo coloring book. &quot;Bye 
Fuji!&quot; She called out brightly. Fujin looked over her shoulder sourly, 
but offered a simple but effective wave.

&quot;Take care.&quot; Quistis chuckled, hugging the girl farewell. Naomi blushed 
bright then giggled before heading out the door cheerfully.

 Shaking her head in amusement, Quistis walked back to the den where 
Fujin sat busily coloring whimsical pictures of Mog&#146;s.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Quistis giggled softly.

&quot;COLOR.&quot; Fujin answered as if obvious.

Sitting crossed legged before her, Quistis observe her quietly a moment 
before speaking up.

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;ENJOY.&quot;

&quot;Since when?&quot;

&quot;ALWAYS.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;ve never seen you.&quot;

&quot;LONG AGO.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;MOTHER, PAINTED.&quot;

&quot;I remember you telling me.&quot;

&quot;SIT BY SIDE.&quot; Fujin continued, then smiled softly before holding up her 
work for Quistis to admire. &quot;WOULD COLOR.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Quistis smiled in warm understanding. Eyes dancing brightly, she 
sorted through the small pile of coloring books then held one up 
thoughtfully. &quot;Mind if I join you?&quot;

*******************

The Ragnarok screamed towards the station, it&#146;s crimson hull gleaming 
like a mirror in the starlight. At the controls, Zell sat blissfully 
doing what he loved, while the girls, Rinoa, Nicole, Selphie and Ellone 
sat in the back chatting noisily.

&quot;Almost there ladies.&quot; He announced as he circled the station once then 
began the docking procedure.

 After docking was complete everyone filed out and quickly found Quistis 
waiting for them.

&quot;Hi guys!&quot; She waved cheerfully.

&quot;Quisty!&quot; The Nicole and Rinoa screamed in unison then rushed forward to 
embrace her. Zell rolled his eyes and stuffed his hands in his pockets.

&quot;Oh man, Miss Trepe you missed out wait till we tell you!&quot; Zell hooted 
loudly.

&quot;Zell!&quot; Selphie barked, then kicked him in the rear.

&quot;Oh crap, hey! I didn&#146;t say anything!&quot; He yelped.

&quot;Ellone, hi!&quot; Quistis shouted, noticing her standing apart from the 
others.

&quot;Hi Quisty.&quot; She smiled, stealing a hug as well. Then, all at once the 
gathered ladies started babbling and yelling excitedly while Zell just 
looked on in confusion.

After the moment past, Rinoa folded her arms and frowned. &quot;You&#146;ve upset 
some folks.&quot;

&quot;Here it comes.&quot; Selphie giggled.

&quot;What? I did? Who?&quot;

&quot;Celest for starters, I got a video postcard from her and she was 
livid.&quot;

&quot;Huh, why!?&quot;

&quot;Basically, she&#146;s mad because you ran off and got married and didn&#146;t 
even invite her.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#146;t really a marriage kind of thing.&quot; Quistis offered glibly.

&quot;Bull.&quot; Selphie giggled.

&quot;Aw damn, poor Celest.&quot; Quistis winced. &quot;We tried to find them in time. 
You guys know that.&quot;

&quot;She said, Raijin is inconsolable, you guys broke his little heart.&quot;

&quot;Poor thing, we&#146;ll have to go visit him. How are they?&quot;

&quot;Okay from what I can tell, they&#146;re up around the Shumi village last 
time I believe.&quot;

&quot;BEVERAGE.&quot; Fujin interrupted as she walked up with Ayane in tow. 
Quistis turned then smiled at the two.

&quot;Oh hey, there you are, I was hoping we&#146;d run into you before we left.&quot;

&quot;FOUND IN CAFETERIA.&quot; Fujin explained, then handed Quistis a soda.

&quot;Friends of yours?&quot; Ayane asked, noting the crowd.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Quistis chuckled.

&quot;Oooh, who&#146;s the brunette in blue?&quot; Ayane whispered under her breath.

&quot;She&#146;s taken.&quot;

&quot;Damn.&quot; She grumbled then brightened hopefully.

&quot;What about...&quot;

&quot;Married.&quot;

&quot;Damn.&quot;

&quot;Taken too.&quot; Quistis giggled, nodding towards Nicole before she could 
even ask.

&quot;How boring.&quot; Ayane sighed humorously.

&quot;She&#146;s single though.&quot; Quistis added, nodding towards Ellone who was 
busily marveling at the textured patterns on a nearby pillar.

Ayane watched her thoughtfully a moment but was waylaid by Quistis.

&quot;Hey guys.&quot; She announced, pulling Ayane around to meet everyone. &quot;This 
is Ayane. Ayane, this is Rinoa, Selphie, Zell, Nicole, and Ellone.&quot; She 
spouted in cheerful introductions. Ayane nodded in awkward politeness as 
Fujin walked over to Zell and kicked him roughly in the shin.

&quot;Ow what the hell was that for?!&quot; He shouted, hobbling about.

&quot;PROBABLY DESERVED.&quot; Fujin smirked in dark satisfaction. &quot;COME, ASSIST.&quot; 
She prompted, nodding towards their baggage.

&quot;Damn, glad to see you too, sheesh.&quot; He grumbled, walking over to help 
her. Quistis noted the exchange in quiet amusement as she chatted with 
the girls, talking about her vacation and catching up on gossip. Ayane 
listened for a moment with interest before curiosity got the better of 
her and she moved to investigate the Ragnarok.

 Zell and Fujin encountered her on the way out.

&quot;Hey, what&#146;s up?&quot; Zell smiled.

&quot;Interesting craft.&quot; Ayane responded, touching the cold metal.

&quot;RAGNAROK.&quot; Fujin announced.

&quot;I&#146;ve seen ships similar from Esthar, newer models, this thing is nearly 
an antique.&quot;

&quot;Hey, she is not!&quot; Zell frowned in insult.

&quot;Oh hey, no offense, I like antique crafts, you&#146;ve kept her in great 
shape. I take it she&#146;s yours.&quot;

&quot;She ain&#146;t no antique.&quot; Zell said again. &quot;And yeah, she&#146;s mine.&quot;

&quot;IS NOT.&quot; Fujin scoffed.

&quot;Well, sorta.&quot; He amended.

&quot;IS NOT.&quot; Fujin said again.

&quot;She&#146;s my baby, I don&#146;t care what Cid says. I&#146;m the one that fixes her 
up.&quot;

&quot;I HELP!&quot; Fujin scowled.

&quot;Okay, well she&#146;s our baby then.&quot;

&quot;How cute.&quot; Ayane smirked sarcastically.

&quot;SHUT UP.&quot; Fujin huffed at her before resuming loading the luggage.

Zell smirked then looked to Ayane sternly.

&quot;She may be old but she&#146;s still top of the line.&quot;

&quot;Who, Fujin?&quot;

Zell laughed then stifled it as Fujin walked past them with an armload 
of bags. She cast them a wary gaze but didn&#146;t stop, but Ayane and Zell 
waited for her to vanish into the craft before resuming.

&quot;She&#146;d kill you if she heard that.&quot; Zell whispered.

&quot;I&#146;m not scared of her.&quot; Ayane chuckled.

&quot;You should be...&quot; Zell said in a tone similar to a peasant talking 
about the local dictator.

&quot;She&#146;s got you guys trained. Good for her.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Zell gawked. &quot;Ain&#146;t nobody trained here!&quot;

&quot;Yeah sure.&quot; Ayane chuckled, then nodded farewell. &quot;See you around.&quot; She 
grinned then moved back to the gathering of women. Quistis noticed her 
glancing appreciably at Rinoa.

&quot;Oh hey Rinoa, Ayane here is interested in show dogs. You should tell 
her about Angelo.&quot; She lied, feeling particularly mischievous.

&quot;I am?&quot; Ayane blinked.

&quot;Oh, oh really!! Finally someone with taste, these jerks have no class!&quot; 
Rinoa beamed spinning around excitedly. Ayane&#146;s eyes widened slightly as 
Rinoa proceeded to grab her by the hand and yank her towards a bench to 
sit. Once there, she produced a large selection of photos of Angelo and 
crooned over them like a proud parent.

&quot;What&#146;s with her and that dog...?&quot; Selphie asked curiously.

&quot;She has more pictures of Angelo than she does of Squall.&quot; Nicole 
giggled

&quot;MORE PERSONALITY.&quot; Fujin explained, walking up, having finished the 
loading.

&quot;You&#146;re one to talk.&quot; Selphie countered sarcastically.

&quot;Hey, now no Squall bashing, he&#146;s my bro.&quot; Zell complained.

&quot;Are we ready?&quot; Quistis asked, stopping the argument before it started

&quot;LOADED UP.&quot; Fujin nodded.

&quot;Hey Miss Trepe.&quot; Zell whispered, out of earshot of Ayane.

&quot;Your friend digs me, I think she was flirting.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Nicole frowned, casting the oblivious woman a dirty glance.

&quot;I doubt that Zell.&quot; Quistis responded casually.

&quot;IS RIGHT, GO CONFRONT.&quot; Fujin prodded him eagerly

&quot;You think I should?&quot; He frowned.

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Hell, I will.&quot; Nicole bristled.

&quot;Great.&quot; Quistis scolded Fujin. &quot;See what you&#146;ve done.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin mouthed in a masterfully wrought look of innocence.

&quot;Zell, you&#146;re not her type, trust me.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;What&#146;s that supposed to mean?&quot; He frowned.

&quot;NOT TYPE.&quot; Fujin reiterated.

Nicole blinked in thought a moment then gaped slightly.

&quot;Oh, oh I get it.&quot; She giggled.

&quot;What?&quot; Zell asked, confused.

&quot;She&#146;s in the, club, right?&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m not hearing this.&quot; Quistis said quietly, walking away from them.

&quot;Club?&quot; Selphie giggled. &quot;That&#146;s one way of putting it.&quot;

&quot;READY TO GO.&quot; Fujin announced, tired of waiting around.

&quot;She&#146;s right guys; the dock master is giving us dirty looks.&quot; Quistis 
noted, waving at a sour looking man glaring at them from across the way.

&quot;Oh, poot and I didn&#146;t even get to the good pictures.&quot; Rinoa fretted.

&quot;No one cares about your smelly dog.&quot; Selphie laughed, prying her from 
Ayane, who looked more than grateful.

&quot;What do you mean by that? Angelo doesn&#146;t smell! You&#146;re the one that 
smells.&quot;

&quot;Continue it inside.&quot; Zell proclaimed, herding the women aboard the 
ship.

Moments later, only Fujin and Quistis remained with Ayane by the 
airlock.

&quot;Well you guys take care.&quot; Quistis smiled, giving her a polite hug. &quot;And 
stay out of trouble.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;ll try.&quot; Ayane said quietly, and then nodded to Fujin. &quot;See you 
around.&quot;

&quot;FAREWELL.&quot; Fujin smirked slightly.

With one last farewell wave, the two quickly turned and entered the 
craft, and within scant moments the ship flared to life and was gone.

**********************

Several moments later Fujin and Zell tried in vain to ignore the raucous 
laughter and hoots that echoed through the Ragnarok&#146;s hull as they 
reentered the atmosphere. Both cringed as they heard their names come up 
but couldn&#146;t hear the gist of the conversation.

&quot;So anyway!&quot; Selphie cackled madly in the middle of a story. &quot;He comes 
strutting in wearing these god awful Speedos.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#146;t that a thong?&quot; Ellone asked curiously.

&quot;Oh dear, he&#146;s too tall and thin for that...&quot; Nicole cringed.

&quot;The man has no fashion sense.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;I think he dresses quite handsomely.&quot; Ellone frowned.

&quot;He&#146;s a cowboy.&quot; Selphie shrugged. &quot;What can I say?&quot;

&quot;The man has never even seen a cow.&quot; Rinoa laughed.

&quot;So Ellone.&quot; Selphie started, ignoring Rinoa&#146;s comment. &quot;When are you 
going to find that special someone?&quot;

&quot;Who me?&quot; Ellone mumbled sheepishly.

&quot;Yes you.&quot;

&quot;Oh I don&#146;t know, I never really thought about.&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot; Why not?&quot; Nicole asked.

&quot;My life is complicated, and with all the problems I&#146;ve caused I&#146;d hate 
to risk getting involved with someone.&quot;

&quot;Oh Ellone don&#146;t think like that.&quot; Quistis frowned.

&quot;No, it&#146;s all right.&quot; Ellone smiled quaintly. &quot;I&#146;m used to going it 
alone.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re not alone.&quot; Quistis pointed out sternly.

&quot;Its okay, I&#146;m used to it.&quot; Ellone said again, then sat back in her seat 
solemnly. The jovial mood quickly diminished into to an awkward silence.

&quot;Buckle up ladies.&quot; Zell&#146;s voice crackled over the intercoms.

&quot;Whew, good, I&#146;m glad to be home.&quot; Quistis yawned, trying to lighten the 
mood.

Glancing out the window, Quistis frowned quizzically.

&quot;Huh, Esthar, why are we here?&quot;

&quot;Um, Cid and Laguna are having a meeting.&quot; Rinoa answered.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Selphie nodded.

There was something amiss, and Quistis could tell it instantly.

&quot;Something&#146;s up.&quot; She commented surely.

&quot;Bah.&quot; Selphie huffed, waving the notion aside.

&quot;Okay now I know something&#146;s going on.&quot; Quistis scowled.

&quot;She&#146;s good.&quot; Ellone whispered to Nicole who just shook her head.

&quot;We promised not to tell!&quot; Rinoa sputtered.

&quot;Tell me what?&quot;

&quot;Nope.&quot; Selphie winked, covering Rinoa&#146;s mouth with her hand.

&quot;Don&#146;t worry about it.&quot; Nicole grinned.

&quot;That&#146;s when I should.&quot; Quistis sighed, and waited for the landing.

 The Ragnarok finally sat down on a landing platform on the grounds of 
Esthar&#146;s presidential estate. A trio of guards greeted them as they 
exited, and two more gentlemen unloaded the luggage.

&quot;Wow.&quot; Quistis smirked, at the royal treatment.

&quot;Come on, Cid and the others are inside, they want to talk to you.&quot; 
Ellone giggled, running down the gangplank.

&quot;Others?&quot; Quistis asked following her warily.

&quot;TROUBLE.&quot; Fujin commented, walking next to her.

&quot;You two are paranoid.&quot; Rinoa laughed.

&quot;WITH REASON.&quot;

After a brief walk, the group entered into a large sitting room, where 
Squall, Irvine, Cid and Laguna sat chatting quietly, while Xu paced 
around with baby Edea asleep in her arms. Irvine was the first to spot 
them and stood.

&quot;There they are.&quot; He smiled, as Selphie ran up to hug him.

&quot;About time.&quot; Xu chuckled.

&quot;Quistis, Fujin, welcome back.&quot; Cid smiled warmly.

&quot;Hi sir.&quot; Quistis beamed, hugging him tightly, while Fujin settled for a 
polite nod.

&quot;Selphie went to gather up her Edea, while Irvine and Zell moved to 
annoy Squall.

&quot;Come walk with us.&quot; Cid asked.

&quot;Pardon?&quot; Quistis blinked curiously, noting Laguna moving to come as 
well.

&quot;Lets talk.&quot; Cid explained further, somewhat evasively.

&quot;Sounds important.&quot;

&quot;It is.&quot;

&quot;Alright then. Fujin wait here, I&#146;ll be back.&quot;

&quot;No, it&#146;s okay, she can come too.&quot; Cid laughed.

&quot;Relax.&quot; Laguna smiled, resting a hand on her shoulder.

Quistis grinned with intrigue. As they left they noticed the others 
watching them out of the corners of their eyes. As they walked Quistis 
noticed an odd exchange of looks between the two older men, while Fujin, 
somewhat paranoid, looked around cautiously.

&quot;I&#146;m glad you girls had fun. Things have been hard on you for the last 
few months.&quot; Cid chatted, as they made their way through the halls of 
the presidential estate. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot;

&quot;Tip top.&quot; Quistis answered, choosing not to mention her rare bouts of 
fatigue. Fujin, trusting her judgment, remained quiet on the issue.

&quot;Good, good.&quot; Cid nodded.

&quot;You know.&quot; Laguna commented next. &quot;The new school season starts soon. I 
bet you&#146;re ready to begin teaching.&quot;

&quot;Oh you have no idea.&quot; Quistis laughed.

&quot;WORRISOME WHEN BORED.&quot; Fujin commented.

Quistis made a face at her then smiled.

&quot;I imagine so; I recall the trouble she got into when she was little.&quot; 
Cid chuckled in remembrance.

Laguna smirked as they made their way out onto a balcony where a small 
shuttle waited.

&quot;Going somewhere?&quot; Quistis asked curiously.

&quot;Actually yes.&quot; Cid said sheepishly. &quot;Kiros is going to fly us out.&quot;

&quot;Out to where?&quot;

&quot;You&#146;ll see.&quot;

Warning flags caused Fujin to stand steadfast.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; She said flatly, firmly locking a hand to Quistis arm.

With a look of surprise Quistis regarded her then looked to Cid.

&quot;Well I guess we&#146;re going to need more information before we leave.&quot; She 
said with a wry grin.

&quot;Told you.&quot; Laguna laughed, as he boarded the shuttle and took a seat 
next to the pilot.

Cid ran a hand through his hair and laughed slightly.

&quot;Cautious sort aren&#146;t you?&quot; He smiled to Fujin who was next to 
emotionless.

&quot;I&#146;ve some important things to talk to you about. Things you should 
know, and after that, something to show you.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin asked, still not moving.

&quot;Fujin be polite...&quot; Quistis said from the corner of her mouth. &quot;You 
know full well there&#146;s nothing wrong. Now quit being silly&quot;

Fujin released her grip but still looked uncomfortable.

&quot;If you please.&quot; Cid prodded, gesturing towards the waiting shuttle.

Once seated and comfortable, the shuttle lifted off and was soon weaving 
between buildings with an armed escort taking up positions alongside.

&quot;Okay first off.&quot; Cid said quietly, taking Quistis&#146; hand. &quot;There&#146;s 
something I wanted to tell you in private.&quot; He explained, glancing at 
Fujin.

&quot;Anything you say to me; can be said in front of her.&quot; Quistis commented 
sternly.

&quot;Of course.&quot; Cid nodded knowingly. &quot;Very well then. It&#146;s about your um, 
growing abilities.&quot;

&quot;You know?&quot; Quistis frowned.

&quot;I suspected it would happen. Especially in light of everything else 
that&#146;s happened.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Your blue magic, as you call it.&quot; Cid elaborated.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Quistis nodded, having a feeling she knew where this was headed.

Cid shifted in his seat uncomfortably.

&quot;I&#146;ve something to tell you. Something that&#146;s been kept quiet for too 
long.&quot;

&quot;Sir.&quot; Quistis sighed, not wanting to see him struggle so.

&quot;Wait, I&#146;ve got to explain some things.&quot; Cid said hurriedly.

&quot;I know.&quot; Quistis countered, cutting him off.

Cid paused and regarded her with a seriousness she nearly found 
troubling.

&quot;I know.&quot; She reiterated.

&quot;Edea...mother, she came to me in a dream.&quot;

Cid blanched and looked about ready to faint.

&quot;When...?&quot;

&quot;Not long after I awoke from my coma.&quot;

&quot;That long ago... and you said nothing?&quot;

&quot;No sir.&quot;

&quot;Quistis...&quot; He sighed sadly.

&quot;It&#146;s okay sir. I know you had your reasons.&quot; She smiled warmly.

Fujin watched the exchange with solemn quietness; touched by the fact 
Quistis would allow her to witness such a private moment.

Cid sat stunned for a moment then choked slightly.

&quot;I am sorry...&quot; He finally managed to say.

Quistis reached out to comfort him.

&quot;We wanted to protect you...&quot;

&quot;You don&#146;t have to explain.&quot;

&quot;Yes I do... Your mother knew Ultimecia would take her. So we decided to 
hide you amongst the others children.&quot;

&quot;She knew?&quot;

&quot;Yes, and then she used her own powers to wipe the memory of you from 
her mind before letting Ultimecia take her.&quot;

&quot;She let her!?&quot;

&quot;Because she held a piece of Ultimecia within her, she told me that long 
ago, that she came to her in a dream, and bequeathed her powers onto 
her. It wasn&#146;t long after that, that things began to change. She knew 
what was happening but we could find no recourse. She even thought about 
sacrificing herself, but knew, that since you were her flesh and blood 
that there was a strong chance you&#146;d inherit her abilities and with it, 
Ultimecia&#146;s taint... So to protect you, she gave up her freewill and 
forgot about you.&quot;

Quistis paled and stiffened visibly and Fujin put an arm around her 
shoulders to comfort her.

&quot;She did all of that for me...?&quot;

&quot;Yes, it was the only way...&quot;

&quot;BUT RINOA...&quot; Fujin asked after a moment.

&quot;What of Rinoa, I thought she inherited the power?&quot;

&quot;She did...&quot; Cid answered with a dark, troubled gaze.

&quot;Edea was a Sorceress before Ultimecia tainted her. When she was 
expunged from your mother, she passed those powers into the next viable 
host, a latent sorceress like yourself. You see, Rinoa lacked the 
training and strength of will you possess and so, Rinoa was an easier 
target...&quot;

&quot;So she has Ultimecia&#146;s powers...not mother&#146;s?&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m afraid so...&quot;

&quot;Does she know?&quot;

&quot;No, and she need not, Edea was confidant that she will be fine but in 
the far future, those powers will find there way back to Ultimecia.&quot;

&quot;FULL CIRCLE.&quot; Fujin frowned.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Cid nodded gravely. &quot;There is another problem though.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t know if I can take anymore.&quot; Quistis said quietly, still 
stunned.

&quot;Adel, we&#146;re not sure who inherited her powers, but there is possibility 
that someone aboard the Lunatic Pandora. The thing is, is that they may 
not even realize what has happened.&quot;

&quot;Any idea who?&quot; Quistis asked worriedly. &quot;Selphie was there... but 
surely she&#146;d realize something was amiss by now.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s the good news, Laguna and I concur that it must be Ellone, but 
there is no way to be certain until she to manifests. But we do know she 
has the potential, like you, she possesses latent powers. That&#146;s why we 
went through so much trouble to hide and protect her.&quot;

&quot;Have you told her your suspicions?&quot;

&quot;No, the child has enough worries.&quot;

&quot;I hope your right...&quot; Quistis frowned. &quot;So it&#146;s official then, I&#146;m a 
sorceress, like Rinoa....&quot;

&quot;I am truly sorry to lay this all on you so suddenly...&quot; Cid sighed 
heavily. &quot;I should have been there for you, I should have said something 
sooner. You deserved a proper father...&quot;

Quistis smiled and leaned forward to kiss his cheek.

&quot;I&#146;ve always loved you like a father, nothing changes.&quot; She said warmly, 
hugging him.

&quot;We&#146;re here!&quot; Laguna shouted from up front.

Quistis sniffed and wiped her eyes. &quot;Here where?&quot; She asked curiously.

&quot;The other thing I wanted to talk to you about.&quot; Cid smiled composing 
himself before opening the hatch. Stepping out of the shuttle the first 
thing Quistis noticed was that they were atop a high cliff overlooking 
the ocean. Shouts and cheers drew her attention and she noticed a large 
gathering of media and onlookers as well as Selphie, Squall, and the 
others walking towards them.

&quot;What is going on?&quot; Quistis asked curiously as Zell hopped up and down 
excitedly.

&quot;You are so going to love this.&quot; He laughed.

&quot;WHAT THE?&quot; Fujin said in awe, noting the fanfare.

&quot;Well, is it time?&quot; Cid asked Laguna curiously.

&quot;You&#146;d have to ask Miss Jennings.&quot; Laguna shrugged, nodding towards a 
familiar couple walking towards them.

&quot;Hi guys!&quot; Naomi beamed with Ayane at her side.

&quot;What!&quot; Quistis stammered. &quot;Why is she here?&quot;

&quot;Oh gee, glad to see you too.&quot; Naomi sneered slightly.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry.&quot; Quistis backtracked. &quot;I just wasn&#146;t expecting...&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s a real kick in the ass eh.&quot; Ayane chuckled.

&quot;Naomi, where is your father, I had assumed he&#146;d be here.&quot;

&quot;For what!?&quot; Quistis all but shouted.

&quot;Oh he&#146;s out working the crowd, you know him, ever the politician.&quot; The 
young woman answered ignoring Quistis&#146; questions.

&quot;Sir.&quot; Selphie smiled up at Laguna dreamily. &quot;I think he may be after 
your job.&quot;

&quot;He can have it.&quot; Laguna laughed, giving her a wink.

&quot;AHEM!&quot; Fujin shouted loudly causing those in the immediate vicinity to 
look.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Quistis smiled graciously towards her then regarded the crowd.

&quot;What the devil is going on?&quot; She asked simply.

&quot;Well.&quot; Cid smiled, throwing an arm around her shoulder and walking out 
towards the cliffs edge.

&quot;I&#146;ve an assignment to ask of you and before you answer I want you to 
see something.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Quistis said quietly, looking out over the expanse of ocean.

With a nod, Cid motioned to Naomi who quickly chattered something into a 
walkie-talkie. Fujin walked to Quistis side and peered out with interest 
the waters began to quake and roil.

&quot;TROUBLE?&quot; Fujin frowned, putting a protective arm in front of Quistis 
and Cid.

&quot;Just watch.&quot; Naomi giggled.

By now, the water was heaving, sending titanic waves crashing against 
the rocks below. An otherworldly glow of intense blue filled the water 
as shape appeared in the depths.

&quot;What is that...?&quot; Quistis asked, backing away from the cliff&#146;s edge.

&quot;Whoa it&#146;s huge!&quot; Zell stammered, eyes bulging. Cid adjusted his glasses 
as he peered on expectantly. Finally the object broke through the 
surface and quickly rose into the air causing great sheets of water to 
roll off its surface like huge waterfalls. Rising from the sea, the 
structure was gigantic, far larger than even Balamb with the bulk of the 
craft consisting of a great domed disk with a large ridged crest and 
central blue eye at fore and beautifully crafted wing-like flares along 
the leading edges. Beneath the disk hung a sea of crystal spires 
dominated by a large central structure vaguely shaped like female torso, 
with down swept wings where arms would be and a fan like tail where the 
torso ended. The ship, if that what it was, had an organic look, it&#146;s 
hull, blue and silver, glistened liked a sea bathed in moonlight. The 
overall effect was awe inspiring if not terrifying. Rising into the air 
with a deep hum the ship blocked out the sun, casting the entire area in 
shadow.

&quot;My god...&quot; Quistis gasped, nearly falling over backwards.

&quot;EDEN!&quot; Fujin blurted in awe.

Cid, was beaming ear from ear as was Laguna who nodded in approval.

&quot;Oh my...&quot; Ayane mouthed quietly, looking at Naomi who just smiled 
proudly.

&quot;Dude, that is awesome!&quot; Zell hooted, punching Squall in the arm.

&quot;How, in the world?&quot; Selphie asked in a near stupor as the great ship 
drifted slowly towards them.

&quot;It&#146;s a long story, but you can thank Laguna and Mr. Jennings.&quot; Cid 
smiled.

&quot;Hyne, what is going on here!?&quot; Quistis nearly shouted in shock.

&quot;That my dear is Esthar Garden.&quot; Cid answered proudly.

&quot;Esthar...&quot; Quistis gawked, then looked at the massive ship.

&quot;It&#146;s huge...I mean enormous...&quot;

&quot;And it&#146;s yours.&quot; He added casually.

&quot;I mean, how, when?&quot; Quistis babbled, apparently not hearing him.

Fujin made a strangled noise and promptly turned her towards Cid.

&quot;What!?&quot; Quistis immediately blurted in shock, his words finally setting 
in.

&quot;Laguna and I agree. You&#146;d be best choice to serve as headmaster.&quot;

&quot;Headmaster...&quot; Quistis mouthed, her cool blue eyes wide in shock.

&quot;You&#146;ve shown time and again you can be depended on. You have the right 
mix of social and martial skills needed to be a proper headmaster. You 
also have the experience needed for such a task. &quot;So what do you say?&quot; 
He smiled then glanced curiously as Zell hooted in the background and 
began dancing what looked to be a football jig as Xu and Irvine tried 
their best to subdue him.

&quot;I don&#146;t know what to say...&quot; Quistis gawked, looking once more at the 
giant Garden floating towards them, the powerful hum of its magical 
engines filling the air like distant thunder.

&quot;You accept?&quot; Cid suggested hopefully.

&quot;You better say yes Trepe or I&#146;m up for it.&quot; Xu interjected, leaning 
into the conversation.

&quot;Um, yes...&quot; Quistis giggled excitedly then screamed.

Cid laughed aloud and clapped merrily and was soon joined buy those 
present.

&quot;So that&#146;s, Esthar Garden huh, very cool.&quot; Selphie beamed.

&quot;Yep.&quot; Naomi answered then nodded to her father who stood with the crowd 
of spectators, promoting the new school. &quot;Amazing isn&#146;t it. They built 
it in less than a year.&quot;

&quot;How?&quot; Quistis marveled; her gaze transfixed as the Garden reached them.

&quot;Hard work and Esthar&#146;s best scientists.&quot; Laguna smiled.

&quot;With help from my dad.&quot; Naomi added.

&quot;Of course.&quot; Laguna amended.

&quot;QUESTION.&quot; Fujin asked gruffly, obviously annoyed by everyone&#146;s lack 
concern about the obvious.

&quot;What&#146;s that?&quot; Cid smiled.

&quot;LOOKS LIKE EDEN.&quot; She repeated gesturing upwards madly.

&quot;So it does.&quot; Cid agreed.

&quot;She has a point sir...&quot; Quistis frowned, getting a funny feeling.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Irvine frowned, looking up. Water cascaded down from the recently 
submerged garden and casually rained atop their heads in a growing 
deluge.

&quot;Ack!&quot; Rinoa yelped as fish and other varied sea life plopped down 
around them.

&quot;Oh dear.&quot; Cid balked as a large tuna crashed to earth at his feet.

&quot;Is it supposed to be coming inland?&quot; Laguna asked worriedly, stepping 
aside as a large lobster smacked wetly nearby.

&quot;Ew!!!&quot; Selphie screamed running for the Ragnarok. &quot;Gross, gross, 
gross!&quot;

&quot;Your people built it!&quot; Squall shouted then groaned in disgust, as an 
unidentified, squid like creature plastered itself onto his back.

&quot;Okay, get to cover.&quot; Quistis said bluntly, herding everyone to the 
Ragnarok. The crowd of onlookers and media nearby amused at first 
quickly began to panic as they avoided being pelted with stray bits of 
flying sea debris. Overhead, Esthar Garden drifted lazily past, water 
still streaming down its smooth surface.

 Under the cover of the Ragnarok, those gathered, shouted and complained 
noisily until Cid got their attention.

&quot;Children please.&quot; He shouted, clapping his hands together before 
walking over to Laguna who was pulling seaweed from Ellone&#146;s hair.

&quot;Laguna, what&#146;s going on?&quot; Cid asked curiously. &quot;Is this a publicity 
stunt?&quot;

&quot;I uh, don&#146;t know.&quot; Laguna frowned, scratching his head.

&quot;I hate to point it out to you guys, but that thing isn&#146;t stopping.&quot; Xu 
noted, pointing into the distance.

&quot;Who&#146;s flying it?&quot; Quistis asked quietly, her uneasiness intensifying.

&quot;I think one of the designers said it could be self automated.&quot; Laguna 
winced then looked to Naomi who was peering out a nearby window for her 
father.

&quot;Naomi.&quot; Cid coughed getting her attention.

&quot;Huh, oh yeah, self automation, it&#146;s a standard feature for all military 
craft now a days.&quot;

&quot;Military craft?&quot; Quistis blinked. &quot;By the way!&quot; She added somewhat 
irked. &quot;I find it&#146;s highly unlikely that us meeting on the station was a 
coincidence.&quot;

&quot;Oh here it comes.&quot; Ayane whistled, moving to a distant part of the 
bridge.

&quot;That would be my fault.&quot; Cid admitted quickly.

&quot;I knew Naomi through her father and asked her to keep an eye on you.&quot;

&quot;You had her spying on me!?&quot; Quistis blurted.

&quot;Um, well...&quot; Cid stammered, he hadn&#146;t really thought of it that way.

&quot;Oh for the love of...&quot; Quistis sighed, rubbing her temples.

&quot;EDEN!&quot; Fujin announced again, more and more troubled over the startling 
resemblance. Cid made a face bordering on frustration and turned to 
Laguna for answers.

&quot;Why does it look like Eden?&quot; He asked in a somewhat snippy tone.

&quot;Good question...&quot; Squall added sourly.

&quot;I just cleared the funding and building permits, cut me some slack I 
didn&#146;t design the thing. I only saw the superstructure before it was 
submerged, and it didn&#146;t look anything like that.&quot; Laguna said almost 
whining.

&quot;Squall, you don&#146;t happen to be junctioned with Eden anymore are you?&quot; 
Quistis asked.

&quot;No.&quot; He bristled. &quot;As a matter of fact I transferred it to Odine last 
time we were in Esthar, he said he wanted to run some tests and Eden 
agreed.&quot;

&quot;Are you nuts!&quot; Quistis balked. &quot;The man is a lunatic.&quot;

&quot;He vouched for him!&quot; Squall countered, gesturing towards Cid.

&quot;Only because Laguna said it was okay.&quot; Cid responded quickly.

&quot;Um... the doctor asked me to put in a good word. He said he had an 
important theory to try. So I figured it&#146;d be okay since he helped with 
the Griever business...&quot; Laguna explained sheepishly.

&quot;You mean to tell me you gave one of the most powerful guardian forces 
on the planet to a quack!&quot; Quistis stated in a disapproving tone.

&quot;Oh that was a mistake.&quot; Irvine huffed.

&quot;FOOLISH!&quot; Fujin added.

&quot;Did no one think to supervise him!?&quot; Selphie blurted. &quot;We all know the 
man is unstable.&quot;

&quot;Um, Jennings was working with him, I don&#146;t know anything about 
sciences.&quot; Laguna frowned. &quot;Okay I may have goofed.&quot;

&quot;Oh, for the love of.&quot; Squall scowled, rubbing his forehead.

&quot;Naomi, any idea what exactly your father and that madman were doing?&quot; 
Quistis asked.

&quot;All I know is that construction hit a snag and was running behind. So 
that Odine guy pops in with some idea which required them to submerge 
the structure.&quot;

&quot;Guys, I think we should high tail it after that thing.&quot; Zell announced 
from the pilot seat. &quot;Telemetry says it&#146;s making a beeline towards 
Esthar.&quot;

&quot;Laguna, do you know where we can find the good doctor?&quot; Cid asked 
politely.

&quot;Um, I think he said he was going to meet us on board the Garden.&quot; 
Laguna explained.

&quot;How convenient.&quot; Squall growled as everyone found a seat and buckled 
up.

&quot;Zell, get us there ASAP.&quot; He shouted.

&quot;You got it boss man.&quot; Zell called back with thumbs up.

Sitting between Cid and Fujin, Quistis took the opportunity to give him 
a hug, while Fujin&#146;s concern grew by leaps and bounds. Obviously, caught 
up in the moment, she knew Quistis didn&#146;t notice the frightening 
similarities of recent events. A few moments into the flight Quistis 
took her hand and gazed at her with concern.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; She whispered.

&quot;WORRIED.&quot;

&quot;About the garden?&quot;

&quot;YES.&quot;

&quot;Seems awfully familiar doesn&#146;t it...&quot; Quistis admitted.

&quot;NOTICED?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but I&#146;ve been trying not too.&quot;

&quot;BAD MEMORIES...&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; Quistis smiled gently, kissing her brow. &quot;Things are different 
now. Besides, I trust these guys, you should too.&quot;

&quot;ODINE TOO?&quot; Fujin commented sourly.

&quot;Well... you have me there.&quot; Quistis admitted regretfully. &quot;Look, we&#146;ll 
just play it by ear.&quot;

&quot;We&#146;re almost there.&quot; Kiros called out pointing to the gigantic craft 
drifting lazily in front of them.

&quot;It&#146;s huge...&quot; Ellone gasped in awe as they pulled up beside the immense 
structure.

&quot;Hey I see a place you can land.&quot; Ayane said eagerly, pointing to a 
outcropping lined with landing lights.

&quot;Looks good to me.&quot; Zell agreed then set the ship down. After preparing, 
everyone disembarked uneasily. On the landing pad, everything seemed in 
order. A large hanger door against the hull, opened and the entire 
landing zone began to slide inwards.

&quot;Whoa!&quot; Irvine muttered, nearly sent of balance.

&quot;It&#146;s okay.&quot; Naomi said calmly. &quot;It&#146;s supposed to do that I think.&quot;

&quot;You think?&quot; Quistis frowned unsurely as the hanger door sealed behind 
them.

The hanger was dark except for a dull blue glow radiating from intricate 
and beautiful designed runes lining the walls.

&quot;Lights.&quot; Naomi called out. A moment later, the room was bathed in a 
soft glow and everyone breathed a sigh of relief upon finding no waiting 
terrors.

&quot;Why do I get the impression you know more than you&#146;re letting on.&quot; 
Squall frowned at the girl.

&quot;Voice automated features are common.&quot; Naomi huffed.

&quot;This place is huge.&quot; Zell said in awe then froze.

&quot;Oh whoa!&quot; Ayane smiled. &quot;Too cool.&quot;

The hanger wasn&#146;t empty, towards the back were no fewer than a dozen 
ships that strongly resembled the Ragnarok but were of a different model 
and less that half the size.

&quot;The XR Models&quot; Laguna smiled. &quot;Top of the line, designed to be agile 
and maneuverable troop transports.&quot;

&quot;See what did I tell you?&quot; Ayane smirked, thumbing at Ragnarok. &quot;That 
thing&#146;s a fossil.&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; Zell barked self-consciously. &quot;She is not; she&#146;d eat those 
things for lunch. Look at em, they&#146;re puny.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t antagonize him please.&quot; Quistis sighed, breaking them up.

&quot;Can we hurry along please?&quot; Cid asked anxiously.

&quot;Yeah really.&quot; Squall mumbled, walking towards the exit.

&quot;Anyone know the way to the bridge?&quot; Selphie asked, running to keep up.

&quot;We&#146;ll find a legend somewhere.&quot; Naomi commented as they made their way 
deeper into the ship.

&quot;I love the design of the place.&quot; Nicole smiled. &quot;It has a kind of 
oceanic feel to it. It reminds me of dolphins.&quot;

&quot;Wonderful Trepe, your new home is a fish.&quot; Irvine laughed.

&quot;Grow up.&quot; Quistis sighed, casting him a humorless look.

&quot;Can we pretend to be serious here; we don&#146;t know what kind of trouble 
we&#146;re in.&quot; Squall grumbled, sorely wishing he&#146;d brought his gunblade.

&quot;Hello!?&quot; Zell shouted, his voice echoing up the halls. Selphie jumped 
slightly at the unexpected call. &quot;Cut it out.&quot;

&quot;Ah there we go.&quot; Naomi cheered, gesturing to a computer terminal 
positioned at the heart of an intersection.

&quot;Hmm looks like we take a tram up to section B then the central elevator 
to the neural core.&quot; She spouted while browsing the files.

&quot;NEURAL CORE.&quot; Fujin blurted, seemingly the only one that noticed.

&quot;Ew, really what is that?&quot; Selphie asked worriedly.

&quot;Um.&quot; Naomi blinked. &quot;You know, I have no idea...&quot;

&quot;Laguna...&quot; Cid mumbled worriedly. Laguna and Kiros both exchanged 
glances but shrugged helplessly.

&quot;I don&#146;t like this...&quot; Quistis frowned, memories of Norg coming 
uncomfortably to mind.

&quot;NOR I.&quot; Fujin agreed.

&quot;Relax.&quot; Squall said, and then walked over to a communication panel. 
&quot;Selphie come here.&quot;

&quot;Huh, why?&quot; She asked, walking over to him.

&quot;Page Odine over the comm. See if he&#146;s on board.&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; Selphie shrugged then studied the panel for a moment. Clearing 
her throat, she picked up the phone and dialed a few buttons. &quot;Creepy 
old Doctor Odine, if you&#146;re aboard please dial extension 397.&quot; She said 
in a dubiously cheerful tone that echoed throughout the craft.

&quot;Cute...&quot; Squall said sarcastically then folded his arms to wait.

A few moments past then the panel buzzed to life with a ring.

&quot;I got it!&quot; Selphie announced, beating Squall to it.

&quot;Hello Doctor Odine?&quot; She beamed.

&quot;Yes, yes, this is Doctor Odine, Tilmett girl this is yes?&quot;

&quot;Ew gross he knows me.&quot; Selphie winced, passing the phone to Squall, 
while flapping her hands in disgust.

&quot;Doctor where are you?&quot; Squall huffed.

&quot;Bridge, yes, the ship is arguing with me. How typical of the beast, I 
do it a favor and it will not listen. &quot; He commented then proceeded to 
babble incoherently about algorithms and neurons.

Squall hung up on him.

&quot;Well?&quot; Irvine asked.

&quot;He&#146;s insane, I think we better hurry.&quot;

&quot;Told you.&quot; Quistis sighed, glancing at the map terminal. &quot;The Tram is 
this way, lets go.&quot;

 After a brief jog the group entered a small train terminal complete 
with small rail car. Piling aboard, Zell took the controls then paused.

&quot;Um, how does this work.&quot; He asked curiously.

&quot;Try entering the arrival code.&quot; Naomi suggested.

&quot;The what?&quot; Zell blurted.

&quot;He&#146;s going to kill us.&quot; Rinoa mumbled.

&quot;Don&#146;t say that...&quot; Ellone frowned.

&quot;Oh, here let me do it.&quot; Ayane groused, thumbing through a laminated 
booklet chained to the controls. In the back, Fujin shifted in her seat 
uncomfortably.

&quot;HURRY.&quot; She finally barked in frustration.

&quot;Got it!&quot; Zell assured them with abroad smile, before the entire tram 
jolted into reverse. Toppling Ayane and Naomi into the windshield.

&quot;Ouch!&quot; The two women squawked before taking a seat.

&quot;FORWARD.&quot; Fujin shouted.

&quot;Zell, come on already.&quot; Irvine blurted.

&quot;Sorry, sorry, sheesh.&quot; Zell blushed, fumbling with the controls.

&quot;Lovely bunch of kids.&quot; Kiros smirked at Cid who sat looking less than 
amused. Quistis took the opportunity to try and ease her mind but the 
similarities with what was going on now and Norg were too disquieting.

&quot;OKAY?&quot; Fujin asked quietly.

&quot;Yeah, I just have a case of the jitters. This is a lot to take in.&quot;

&quot;UNDERSTANDABLE.&quot; Fujin nodded empathically.

&quot;I&#146;m sure everything&#146;s.&quot; Laguna assured them.

&quot;This is so cool, it&#146;s like I&#146;m on a mission.&quot; Nicole giggled excitedly.

&quot;You don&#146;t get out much do you?&quot; Ayane asked her candidly.

&quot;Um not really, why?&quot;

&quot;No reason.&quot;

Seemingly no sooner than the journey started, it ended somewhat abruptly 
as the tram eased to a stop. Disembarking, everyone looked around in 
wonder at a large plaza. The area was bathed in sunlight, filtered 
through transparent screens of crystal the shimmered like moonlight on 
water. Various shops and venues lined the walls of the circular area, 
and at the center stood a small park; complete with decorative water 
fountain and small trees. The shops were dark, awaiting the arrival of 
new employees, and the only sound that could be heard was the soothing 
thrumming of the ships engines and the trickle of water from the 
fountain.

&quot;It&#146;s like a small city in here!&quot; Selphie marveled, scampering towards 
the nearest shop. &quot;They&#146;ve got clothing stores, caf&eacute;&#146;s, even a theater!&quot;

&quot;I hate you.&quot; Xu said flatly to Quistis.

&quot;What!?&quot; Quistis gawked laughingly.

&quot;While I&#146;m clunking around in Balamb, you get this paradise.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;d hardly call it a paradise...&quot; Quistis frowned, still uneasy about 
the whole thing.

&quot;I dunno Quisty, it&#146;s awfully nice.&quot; Rinoa noted, peering off into the 
serene fountain.

&quot;JOB TO DO!&quot; Fujin reminded them, pointing to a series of elevators.

&quot;Okay, she&#146;s right.&quot; Quistis frowned.

Squall stepped forward and put his hands on his hips then looked to 
Zell.

&quot;You&#146;re with me, Quistis, you too, the rest of you stay here while 
we...&quot; He started then paused. &quot;Uh...&quot; He mumbled growing flush. 
&quot;Sorry.&quot; He shirked, and then motioned for Quistis to take charge.

&quot;Oh, um. Yeah&quot; She blinked then smiled graciously. &quot;Squall, Zell, if 
you&#146;d be so kind to join Fujin and I. We&#146;ll go check this out.&quot;

&quot;You expect us to just sit here!&quot; Irvine protested.

&quot;Yes actually.&quot; Quistis winked then walked to the elevator with her 
group. Inside, they stared in blank confusion at the array of options. 
Sticking her head out, Quistis looked to Naomi who seemed to be waiting 
expectantly.

&quot;Come here.&quot; Quistis said simply.

&quot;I was wondering how long it would take before you realized you needed 
me.&quot; The younger girl giggled.

&quot;Want me to come?&quot; Ayane asked quietly.

&quot;Nah, we&#146;ll be right back.&quot; Naomi grinned, then rushed to join the 
others on the elevator. Once inside, Naomi leaned forward to investigate 
the panel, purposely but discreetly brushing her rear against Fujin&#146;s 
hips in the process.

Fujin all but fell over backwards trying to get away, causing everyone 
to stare at her.

&quot;What in the hell is wrong with you?&quot; Zell blurted as she nearly tripped 
into him. Quistis, keen eyed as always, caught the motion and leaned 
down to whisper in Naomi&#146;s ear.

&quot;Leave her alone...&quot; She said evenly.

&quot;Sorry...&quot; Naomi flinched before pressing a series of buttons. Coming to 
life, the elevator began to rise. Almost immediately Quistis staggered 
and held her head.

&quot;QUISTIS?&quot; Fujin called out worriedly, steadying her.

&quot;Something...&quot; Quistis mumbled. &quot;Something is talking to me...&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot; Zell blurted. &quot;I don&#146;t hear anything.&quot;

Squall found the longing for his gun blade intensify, something terribly 
wrong was occurring.

&quot;Confusion, wonder... where am I?&quot; Quistis mumbled in a near trance.

&quot;QUISTIS.&quot; Fujin said again, this time shouting as she shook Quistis&#146; 
shoulders. The jolt had the desired effect and Quistis looked at her.

&quot;There is something here...something powerful...&quot; She breathed, eyes 
wide.

&quot;What has he done?&quot; Squall muttered under his breath.

The elevator opened into a dimly lit hallway that pulsed with a deep 
blue light. At the end of the hall stood a massive metal door engraved 
with an intricate circle of glowing, silver white runes. On either side 
of the door rose elegant twin staircases that joined together at the top 
into a grand balcony.

 Above the door was a series of letters and numbers: ED-NC-001.

&quot;Suggestions?&quot; Quistis asked as she strode forward.

&quot;ODINE!&quot; Fujin shouted, calling for the eccentric doctor.

&quot;Here, here, yes, yes!&quot; The short, peculiar man blurted, appearing atop 
the balcony. Quickly he hobbled down the stairs and stood before them, 
eyes wide.

&quot;She will not listen! Impudent thing.&quot; He babbled and cursed then turned 
to run for the engraved door.

&quot;Fujin.&quot; Quistis growled. Immediately, Fujin grabbed the man by the 
collar and yanked him backwards.

&quot;ANSWERS.&quot; She said flatly, shoving him back towards the group.

&quot;What, no time, no time!&quot; He babbled, and then gestured up the 
staircase.

&quot;What, no time for what?&quot; Quistis shouted, eyes fixing on his.

&quot;I&#146;ll check it out.&quot; Zell offered, and then ran up the stairs.

&quot;Squall, go with him.&quot; Quistis said, then focused back on the insane 
scientist.

&quot;What is going on and what have you done?&quot; She asked, her tone stern and 
deliberate.

&quot;Quistis!&quot; Squall shouted, rushing towards the balcony to peer down at 
the trio.

&quot;What is is?&quot; She asked, looking up at him.

&quot;Come up here, quick, we&#146;ve got a problem!&quot;

&quot;Bring him.&quot; Quistis huffed, then hurried up the stairs. Fujin looked 
down at Odine&#146;s hunched form.

&quot;WILL DRAG YOU.&quot; She threatened.

&quot;I&#146;ll go.&quot; Odine said meekly then followed.

Following Squall, Quistis skidded to a halt as the reached the top of 
the steps and passed through a large doorway.

&quot;I take it this is the bridge.&quot; She marveled. Huge, and spacious the 
bridge jutted out like a ledge and was closed in by a large half sphere 
of what looked like glass, but was obviously magically treated. Looking 
around, she realized they bridge was located behind the large central 
eye like structure at the Garden&#146;s leading edge. In typical fashion, the 
captain&#146;s chair dominated the bridge, nestled into an elegant crane like 
structure that could be raised if needed, for a better view of the 
bridge&#146;s comings and goings, and to offer a point of view more central 
to the so called eye of the Garden. The chair sat at the center of 
arrowhead pattern. On both sides of captain&#146;s chair sat several 
terminals and control stations while at the tip of the arrow sat a 
comfortable, slightly reclined seat, similar to a disembodied cockpit. 
Above the cockpit hung a metallic arm from which rest a series of 
displays, switches and headset.

All along the surface of the massive, curved windscreen various 
holographic images showed telemetry, and various views of the garden and 
the surrounding area. Several screens showed overhead maps and global 
positioning. Most noticeable, and troubling of all though wasn&#146;t what 
was being flashed on the screen, but what was going outside.

&quot;SHIT!&quot; Fujin blurted, speaking what everyone else was thinking.

A mountain lay straight ahead, looming large in the distance.

Quistis looked stunned a moment then grabbed Odine.

&quot;Do something!&quot;

&quot;Listen, listen she doesn&#146;t, frightened she is!&quot; The man babbled.

&quot;I&#146;m going to throw you out the nearest air lock.&quot; Quistis growled, then 
turned to regard the others.

&quot;Controls, find the controls!&quot; She shouted then rushed for the captain&#146;s 
chair. While everyone else hurried towards anything else that looked 
helpful.

Zell jumped into the cockpit like seat and began searching desperately.

&quot;Found a control stick!&quot; He shouted in glee then pulled back hard on it 
but to no avail. Quistis had just seated herself in the captain&#146;s chair 
and began looking for anything that could help their predicament when a 
wave of panic and confusion washed over her, stunning her.

&quot;We&#146;re going to hit!&quot; Squall shouted seconds before everything went 
insane. The collision was hard, but luckily the main section of the 
Garden missed the mountain; however the lower under hanging structures 
caught the full brunt of the impact, shattering several crystal spires 
and gravely crushing large sections of central tower. The mountain 
however fared worse, as the collision sheered off the top hundred or so 
feet and sent it crashing down the slope in an avalanche of stone and 
snow. The garden heaved forward crazily; luckily the bridge was on some 
sort of stabilizing system and or else they&#146;d have been slung out of 
their seats. Turning of it&#146;s own accord, the Garden then scrapped it&#146;s 
left side across the face of the ruined mountaintop top as it circled 
completely around and began lurching back towards the ocean.

Quistis screamed, a sound echoed by what sounded like Ellone and Rinoa 
downstairs.

Fujin hurried to Quistis side and hauled her out of the seat and laid 
her gently on the floor.

&quot;QUISTIS?&quot; She called out, checking her for injuries.

&quot;I&#146;ll go check on the others.&quot; Squall shouted, hurrying downstairs.

&quot;Yo, we&#146;re picking up speed!&quot; Zell shouted, as he struggled with the 
controls.

&quot;Odine...&quot; Quistis croaked, sitting up.

Fujin glanced till she found the man cowering behind the captain&#146;s 
chair. Promptly she grabbed him by the shoulder and dragged him to 
Quistis.

&quot;What the hell have you done?!&quot; Quistis hissed dangerously at him. 
&quot;Experiment! Grand experiment!&quot; He cheered. &quot;Saved she is!&quot;

&quot;What kind of experiment? Tell me or so help me I&#146;ll rip the answers 
from your skull.&quot; Quistis snarled, struggling to stand. The sheer 
savagery of the threat caused Fujin to stare at her in concern.

&quot;Holy crap!&quot; Zell screeched, jumping from the cockpit to peer over the 
edge of the bridge platform. &quot;Guys come here, quick look at this!&quot; He 
shouted, gesturing wildly.

Fujin helped Quistis along as they hurried over to look. Outside, along 
the damaged side of the ship, the bent and savaged metal began twisting 
and reforming of it&#146;s own accord. In horror, Quistis staggered back 
while Fujin grabbed Odine by the neck and powered by Pandemonium, she 
easily lifted him off the ground.

&quot;NORG!&quot; She shouted in outrage.

&quot;Whoa! Whoa!&quot; Zell shouted, grabbing her arm. &quot;Put him down, you&#146;ll kill 
him!&quot;

&quot;Fujin!&quot; Cid called out, as he and the others hurried towards them.

Fujin twitched in anger a moment then dropped the scientist 
unceremoniously on his ass.

&quot;How&#146;s everyone?&quot; Quistis asked quietly, still stunned by what she&#146;d 
seen.

&quot;I&#146;m okay...&quot; Ellone said meekly.

&quot;I felt something; I don&#146;t know how to explain it.&quot; Rinoa gasped, 
looking just as woozy as Quistis and Ellone.

&quot;I heard someone mention say Norg...&quot; Irvine noted, his voice holding a 
certain quaver.

&quot;Look for yourselves.&quot; Zell explained, pointing out the window, where 
the regeneration process was well underway.

&quot;Damn it, damn it, damn it!&quot; Squall shouted, throwing a holy fit.

&quot;Squall?&quot; Laguna asked worriedly going to his side.

&quot;You&#146;re a screw up!&quot; Squall blurted in outrage. &quot;How the hell could you 
have let this happen under your own nose!?&quot;

&quot;Squall...&quot; Rinoa said sadly, putting a hand on his shoulder.

&quot;He&#146;s right...this is my fault&quot; Laguna frowned then looked at the doctor 
darkly. &quot;Odine, what have you done...?&quot;

&quot;I uh...&quot; The old scientist gulped, having the distinct impression that 
how he answered would dictate if he lived to see how this all played 
out. Focusing his mind enough to keep from being distracted with 
thoughts of work and various theories, he wisely decided to pay full 
attention to matter at hand.

&quot;A full recollection?&quot; He asked.

&quot;Everything...&quot; Laguna said dangerously.

&quot;Okay... After the... um...&quot; He paused, looking for a good word. 
&quot;Tragic, yes tragic events at Balamb. I took the opportunity to take 
samples of the offending organism.&quot; He started.

&quot;You mean Norg...&quot; Quistis said with downright disgust.

&quot;Um, yes...yes...that is correct...Norg.&quot;

&quot;Can I say something?&quot; Nicole chirped.

&quot;What?&quot; Laguna asked.

&quot;Why isn&#146;t he in a prison or something, isn&#146;t he crazy?&quot; She asked 
curiously.

&quot;Not now.&quot; Xu whispered to her.

Laguna took a breath then looked back at Odine. &quot;Continue.&quot;

&quot;Genius, pure genius.&quot; Odine said somewhat proudly. &quot;Created facsimile 
of organism, pure, perfect.&quot;

&quot;You cloned Norg?&quot; Quistis stated in a simple and even tone inflecting 
that is was obvious that what he&#146;d done was without a doubt the most 
insane thing anyone could ever hope to do.

&quot;No, no clone.&quot; The doctor quickly amended, waving a finger at her. 
&quot;Similar yes, but not true, unique creation...but problem.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you made a copy of a freak and let it loose on the world again.&quot; 
Selphie said in a sardonic tone.

&quot;No.&quot; Odine snipped sourly at her impudence. &quot;Had no...hmm...&quot; He 
frowned then smiled. &quot;Soul.&quot; He nodded. &quot;Yes, yes, was little more than 
a vegetable.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so you released a mindless rutabaga of destruction on the world, 
even better.&quot; Selphie quipped then looked to Laguna pleadingly. &quot;Can we 
beat him now, or do we have to listen to anymore of this?&quot;

&quot;Selphie.&quot; Squall groaned.

&quot;Let me guess.&quot; Quistis soured, putting two and two together.

&quot;You saw an opportunity for your little experiment when Jennings hit a 
snag. You then bonded Eden to your little monster and placed it in the 
superstructure of this Garden.&quot;

&quot;Bright girl, bright girl.&quot; Odine clapped proudly. &quot;She is brilliant, 
brilliant!&quot; He raved until Quistis promptly punched him in the mouth.

&quot;Whoa.&quot; Zell blinked as the good doctor slid past him.

&quot;Well hey at least its Eden we&#146;re dealing with, not Norg.&quot; Selphie said 
hopefully. &quot;I mean; that&#146;s good right?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Odine muttered, fingering his mouth in hopes that he hadn&#146;t lost 
any teeth. &quot;Chose Eden for purpose, most stable, most intelligent. 
Squall boy, you said yourself, willing she was.&quot;

&quot;Well... yes.&quot; Squall mumbled. &quot;But if had known what you were planning, 
But that&#146;s just it...I didn&#146;t but I take it Eden did. That&#146;s why she 
agreed...&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t get it?&quot; Nicole commented meekly.

&quot;Guardians lack a physical body of their own, that&#146;s why the work with 
us, so that they can experience things. Basically, the doctor here grew 
a living corpse and let Eden possess it.&quot;

&quot;Ew gross.&quot; Selphie gasped, looking around in disgust.

&quot;Not a corpse, sentient, magic infused, semi-organics.&quot; Odine said 
proudly. &quot;This place is as much machine and magic as it is alive. A 
perfect fusion of all facets of existence.&quot;

&quot;This is all making my head hurt...&quot; Zell groaned, then looked outside. 
&quot;Hey we&#146;re over the ocean.&quot; He commented casually. &quot;At least we don&#146;t 
have to worry about hitting anything?&quot; As if on cue, Eden decided to 
plow itself into the water. Everyone was thrown to the floor and the 
room was bathed in a blue glow as sunlight filtered down through the 
water above.

&quot;Okay, what was that?&quot; Ayane asked, as everyone hauled themselves to 
their feet.

&quot;Water, base elements, helps the regeneration process, wonderful, 
wonderful, she remembers.&quot; Odine smiled.

&quot;I thought the cold killed it.&quot; Quistis frowned.

&quot;Not a clone, similar but different.&quot; He reminded her. &quot;Norg was 
inferior, I improved.&quot; He added smugly.

&quot;Um guys?&quot; Selphie asked, it got steadily darker; soon only the internal 
lights gave any illumination.

&quot;We&#146;re still sinking...&quot; Cid noted, glancing at the murky depths.

&quot;Zell where are we at?&quot; Quistis asked worriedly.

&quot;Um... Mid oceanic plain Gehenna Valley...&quot; He said, glancing at a 
nearby monitor.

&quot;That&#146;s a deep a tectonic rift.&quot; Nicole explained. &quot;More than six 
miles.&quot;

&quot;I assume this place is made to travel underwater as well?&quot; Quistis 
asked Naomi with a look of concern.

&quot;Yes, I believe so, but I don&#146;t think it&#146;s a good idea to go that deep.&quot; 
The young woman explained, then added.  &quot;Just for the record though, I 
didn&#146;t know about any of this. I swear.&quot;

&quot;I believe you.&quot; Quistis sighed, giving a small smile.

&quot;Sinking, sinking, not good.&quot; Odine spouted. &quot;Jennings is right, too 
deep is not a good thing, implode we will.&quot;

 Ellone giggled causing everyone to look at her sourly.

&quot;What?&quot; Selphie sighed, sitting down in the floor wearily.

&quot;Um nothing...&quot; Ellone blushed. &quot;It&#146;s just now that we&#146;re in the water 
it occurred to me this place looks like a big jelly fish.&quot;

No one said anything.

&quot;That&#146;s all.&quot; Ellone squeaked.

&quot;Okay then.&quot; Quistis sighed then looked to Odine. &quot;When do we need to 
worry?&quot;

&quot;Unsure, but I&#146;d estimate about 23,000 feet.&quot;

&quot;Little more than three miles...&quot; Quistis frowned then looked to Zell. 
&quot;Where are we now?&quot;

&quot;2,700 and dropping.&quot; Zell answered grimly.

&quot;How much time till we reach crush 23,000?&quot;

&quot;About twenty minutes at this rate.&quot;

&quot;Okay that&#146;s time to work with.&quot; Quistis sighed. &quot;Anyone, I&#146;m open to 
suggestions here.&quot;

&quot;Can&#146;t we try to talk to it?&quot; Ellone offered.

Quistis blinked in a stupor, in her blind anger she&#146;d not once even 
considered the idea.

&quot;Um, yeah really, you said she&#146;s being stubborn, how do you know?&quot;

&quot;Stubborn, yes, yes, she will not do what is asked.&quot;

&quot;Great, we don&#146;t even know if she&#146;s listening then.&quot;

&quot;Yo Eden!&quot; Zell barked aloud. &quot;Yohoo!&quot;

&quot;Zell please...&quot; Squall said quietly.

&quot;Hey you never know.&quot; Zell shrugged.

&quot;He&#146;s right.&quot; Quistis admitted. &quot;If Eden is anything like Norg, then she 
knows everything that is going on. The worry is; does she care?&quot;

&quot;Eden has always been stable; I don&#146;t think she&#146;d intentionally harm 
us.&quot; Squall explained.

&quot;Crushing us to death seems kind of hostile Squall.&quot; Xu frowned.

&quot;You say Guardian&#146;s don&#146;t have physical forms right.&quot; Kiros asked. &quot;Then 
perhaps this thing doesn&#146;t know what&#146;s it&#146;s doing, it&#146;s like a child. I 
have a son, when he first learned to walk he wobbled out onto the porch 
and skinned his knee on the steps. What did he do? He ran inside to his 
mother.&quot;

&quot;He has a point.&quot; Quistis smiled. &quot;I&#146;m sure she&#146;s confused, but feels 
safe in the water. After all, this is where she was...born...&quot; She 
frowned then looked venomously at Odine. &quot;If you can call it that.&quot;

&quot;Well it&#146;s going to die here if it keeps descending. We&#146;re at 4,300&quot; 
Said moodily.

&quot;I sensed something earlier, right before we crashed.&quot; Ellone spoke up 
sheepishly. &quot;Panic...&quot;

&quot;Me too.&quot; Quistis nodded. &quot;I think it&#146;s trying to reach us.&quot;

&quot;Hell, with all these monitors and stuff you&#146;d think it&#146;d send us a 
message.&quot; Irvine said hurriedly.

&quot;It probably doesn&#146;t know how.&quot; Nicole responded. &quot;Kiros is right, it&#146;s 
like a baby; it doesn&#146;t know how to use its body yet.&quot;

&quot;We&#146;re trapped inside a toddler.&quot; Selphie groaned.

&quot;I&#146;m not believing this.&quot; Quistis sighed, rubbing her temples. &quot;Fu, any 
ideas?&quot;

&quot;NEURAL CORE.&quot; Fujin shrugged, helplessly.

&quot;Okay, the neural core.&quot; Quistis said, looking once more to Odine.

&quot;6,200.&quot; Zell called out.

&quot;Heart of Garden, very protective.&quot; He warned.

&quot;We don&#146;t won&#146;t to hurt anything, we just want to communicate.&quot;

&quot;DEFENSES?&quot; Fujin asked, just in case.

&quot;Unknown really, stubborn thing, no one allowed inside.&quot;

&quot;She&#146;s going to kill us.&quot; Irvine grumbled.

&quot;Don&#146;t say things like that...&quot; Nicole whined.

&quot;Volunteers to go with me?&quot; Quistis asked.

&quot;Like you need to ask.&quot; Squall smirked.

&quot;We&#146;re all going.&quot; Irvine said motioning, to Zell, Selphie and Rinoa.

&quot;You all be careful.&quot; Cid pleaded.

&quot;I hope Ward takes better care of Edea then you have of us.&quot; Selphie 
chided Laguna smilingly.

&quot;She&#146;ll be fine, I promise. You guys just come back in one piece.&quot; 
Laguna smiled awkwardly.

&quot;I&#146;m coming too.&quot; Ellone called out, finally building up the nerve.

&quot;Ellone?&quot; Quistis frowned. &quot;I really, don&#146;t think...&quot;

&quot;No Quistis, no, I&#146;m not being shut out, I felt it too, something 
calling us.&quot;

&quot;Sir, I think she needs to know.&quot; Quistis sighed, looking to Cid.

&quot;I was hoping I was wrong.&quot; Cid frowned.

Nicole, taking over for Zell called out.

&quot;We&#146;re at 8,600.&quot;

&quot;We need to hurry.&quot; Squall said sharply. &quot;What ever you two have to say 
best to say it now.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Ellone whimpered having a feeling she wasn&#146;t going to like what 
came next.

&quot;Laguna.&quot; Cid nodded.

&quot;Damn it.&quot; Laguna sighed wiping his brow. &quot;Okay. Ellone... listen. I&#146;m 
sorry to put this on you so quick but we really don&#146;t have the time.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m going to die aren&#146;t I?&quot; Ellone mumbled worriedly.

&quot;No!?&quot; Laguna stammered, caught off guard by her pessimism. &quot;No, what 
makes you think that. Not at all.&quot;

&quot;9,000 Feet.&quot; Nicole called out.

&quot;Laguna, Ellone.&quot; Quistis prodded.

&quot;Okay, here it is. We think you&#146;ve inherited Adel&#146;s powers...&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Ellone nodded blankly then fainted.

&quot;Oh come on!&quot; Zell blurted. &quot;You&#146;ve got to be kidding me; we don&#146;t have 
time for this!&quot;

&quot;We have to go.&quot; Quistis snapped. &quot;See if you can&#146;t bring her around, we 
may need her.&quot; She ordered then hurried down the stairs to the giant 
rune covered door.

&quot;Look for a way to open it.&quot; She said, as everyone fanned out looking 
for any sort of control panel.

&quot;No luck.&quot; Zell called out.

&quot;Ditto.&quot; Irvine agreed.

&quot;MOVE.&quot; Fujin scowled, stepping before the door. Everyone cleared out of 
the way as she began to channel Pandemonia.

&quot;Fujin wait!&quot; Quistis blurted.

&quot;WHAT?&quot;

&quot;We can&#146;t go in like that, if we cause damage this close to the core, 
she&#146;ll freak and we don&#146;t want that.&quot;

&quot;APOLOGY.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s okay, we&#146;re all a little antsy here.&quot; She said understandingly 
then looked to Rinoa. &quot;You up for a little magic lesson?&quot;

&quot;Um sure, what do you have in mind?&quot;

&quot;Follow my lead.&quot;

&quot;What are we doing?&quot;

&quot;I figure with Edea and Ultimecia&#146;s powers at our disposal we should 
have no problem coaxing this thing open.

&quot;What?&quot; Squall asked making a screwed up face.

&quot;Ellone&#146;s not the only new sorceress.&quot; Quistis said simply, wishing not 
to waste time on lengthy explanations.

&quot;Fair enough.&quot; Squall shrugged, somewhat confused.

&quot;Are you serious?&quot; Rinoa beamed happily as they placed their hands on 
the door.&quot;

&quot;Yes...&quot;

&quot;Cool, I&#146;m not alone anymore!&quot;

&quot;You never were, but that&#146;s not going to matter unless we concentrate.&quot;

&quot;Right!&quot;

Closing their eyes the two women focused on their internal energies, 
bringing them into a tangible form, of blue and gold. The magical forces 
entwined and meshed as they slowly wormed their way into the cracks and 
crevasses of the massive steel doors.

&quot;I think I can sense a locking mechanism...&quot; Rinoa whispered.

&quot;Hush, concentrate.&quot; Quistis mumbled under her breath.

Quietly Ellone made her way downstairs and marveled at the site.

&quot;Sorry...&quot; She whispered to Squall.

&quot;It&#146;s okay.&quot;

&quot;Um what are they doing?&quot;

&quot;Trying to open the door.&quot;

&quot;14,000 Feet&quot; Nicole&#146;s voice echoed over the intercom.

&quot;You&#146;re supposed to be a sorceress, go help em!&quot; Selphie squeaked, 
shoving her slightly.

&quot;What? I wouldn&#146;t know how?&quot; Ellone fretted.

&quot;That never stopped you before.&quot; Squall said wryly.

&quot;Someone do something I&#146;m about to load my shorts over here.&quot; Irvine 
groused.

&quot;Ew gross, you&#146;re such an ogre!&quot; Selphie blurted scowling at him.

&quot;ELLONE.&quot; Fujin said firmly. &quot;GO, ASSIST.&quot;

&quot;You think I should?&quot;

&quot;YES.&quot;

&quot;All right...&quot; She nodded tentatively then crept forward.

&quot;This would be easier if I knew how to do this...&quot; Rinoa mumbled.

&quot;Focus...&quot; Quistis hissed under her breath.

&quot;Can I help...&quot; Ellone said meekly, stepping between them.

Quistis opened an eye and looked at her with surprise.

&quot;Actually yes.&quot; Quistis smirked. &quot;Put your hands on the door, then 
focus, think of it opening, if you encounter resistance coax it aside.&quot;

&quot;Okay...&quot; Ellone nodded and did as she was told. Immediately the light 
show strengthened as the swirls of gold and blue were soon joined a 
white light. Moments past, precious minutes ticked by as the light 
merged into one blinding cornea of white. Finally without a fuss, the 
massive door split in the middle and began to swing outward.

&quot;You did it!&quot; Selphie cheered.

Their task complete, the three women staggered backwards.

&quot;See, and you wanted to blow stuff up!&quot; Zell teased Fujin.

&quot;Good job ladies.&quot; Quistis smiled proudly to Rinoa and Ellone.

&quot;17,000 Feet.&quot; Nicole sounded over the intercom, the stress evident in 
her tone. Somewhere, deep in the ship, the sound of metal groaning under 
the pressure could be heard.

&quot;Hyne!&quot; Irvine blurted. &quot;That took too long&quot;

&quot;Hurry!&quot; Quistis shouted, rushing through the door.

Inside, the chamber was comfortably warm and humid, the walls glistened 
with moisture and thick layer of mist coated the ground. The room was 
large and circular with a fairly low ceiling. The walls, floor and 
ceiling consisted of a black metal with lines of pulsing blue arcing in 
patterns towards the center of the ceiling. At the center of the room 
hovered a sphere of what appeared to be black marble, with veins of 
silver and blue. Around the sphere were large azure crystals sprouting 
from the floor and ceiling, all of which where connected with a spider 
web array of pulsing lights and electrical arcs. The ring of crystals as 
open on the side facing the entrance and cautiously the group walked 
closer to the sphere.

&quot;Well...&quot; Quistis whispered. &quot;Here we are...&quot;

The sphere was large, easily six feet in circumference and the space 
between it, the floor and the ceiling was less that a four.

&quot;21,000 Feet, approaching critical depth.&quot; Nicole called out, her voice 
barely audible inside the chamber. Now the entire structure began to 
vibrate as the water pressure threatened to crush everything to ruin.

&quot;Eden...&quot; Quistis called out. &quot;We&#146;re here to help.&quot;

A wave of invisible energy washed out from the core. Most present felt 
nothing, but the resident sorceress&#146; were thrown to their knees.

&quot;We were right...&quot; Rinoa gasped. &quot;It&#146;s confused; it can&#146;t remember how 
it got here.&quot;

&quot;Can you talk to her?&quot; Squall asked, beginning to worry.

&quot;I can try...&quot; Quistis nodded then closed her eyes.

A moment past and her eyes bolted open.

&quot;She&#146;s hurt, and afraid, she doesn&#146;t know what to do.&quot;

&quot;Well, getting out of the water is a good start.&quot; Irvine barked.

&quot;I sense panic.&quot; Ellone whispered, concentrating. &quot;It&#146;s hard for her to 
move.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s the water pressure.&quot; Quistis scowled.

&quot;23,000 Feet...&quot; Nicole said shakily. &quot;Passing critical depth.&quot;

&quot;There was a manual control on the bridge but it wouldn&#146;t work&quot; Zell 
said hurriedly. &quot;Tell her to let us help!&quot;

&quot;Eden, we can&#146;t do anything unless you let us take control!&quot; Quistis 
shouted at the hovering orb.

&quot;She&#146;s afraid.&quot; Rinoa muttered her eyes closed in meditation.

&quot;She&#146;s afraid!?&quot; Zell blurted.

&quot;We&#146;ll do it together...&quot; Quistis whispered, trying to keep her focus.

&quot;Interface....&quot; Ellone mumbled then jumping to her feet. &quot;She&#146;s wants 
one of us to link directly with her.&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot; Quistis stammered as Ellone hurried towards the exit.

&quot;Someone to hold her hand!&quot; Ellone explained then was gone. Somewhere in 
the distance a loud rending noise echoed sharply through the craft.

&quot;It&#146;s starting!&quot; Squall cursed. Turning, everyone ran to follow Ellone 
back up the stairs and onto the bridge. As the arrived, they paused in 
shock at the site that greeted them. Outside, just within range of the 
external lights a sheer cliff face could be seen, they were in the 
trench. The various free floating monitors hissed with static and the 
outer dome was vibrating terribly as telltale cracks began to stretch 
slowly across it&#146;s face despite Eden&#146;s efforts to keep itself together.

&quot;Hyne!&quot; Quistis gasped in horror. &quot;Ellone what are you talking about? 
Link how?&quot;

&quot;An interface! Help me find the interface.&quot; Ellone babbled, as she 
looked around frantically.

Nicole, sitting in the pilot&#146;s seat yelped in fright as a mass of wires 
and tentacles erupted around her. &quot;25,000 Feet!&quot; She shouted then leapt 
clear.

&quot;I will not die like this!&quot; Quistis growled then jumped into the 
captain&#146;s chair. &quot;Ellone there&#146;s your interface! Rinoa help me try and 
keep us together!&quot;

&quot;Right!&quot; Rinoa nodded as the two women closed their eyes and began 
channeling their considerable energies. Immediately an explosive dome of 
white light spread outward from the two and enveloped all in its path. 
The magical wave slammed and seeped into the very walls of the tortured 
garden causing them to glow. Cid and Laguna exchanged worried looks 
while Selphie and Irvine clung to each other whispering soft words. Now, 
the entire structure was shaking violently, and the sounds of groaning 
metal could be heard throughout. The sound was nightmarish, akin to the 
scream of children. Stunned into action, Ellone moved to sit down, even 
as pilot&#146;s console was rebuilding itself. Settling down, she could feel 
things moving and rearranging themselves. The headset hanging above her 
head, morphed and shifted into it formed a halo like structure behind 
her head. Quistis and Rinoa shone radiantly as the struggle to counter 
the unstoppable forces intensified.

&quot;Ellone hurry!&quot; Quistis grunted as Rinoa fell to her knees from the 
strain.

&quot;CONTINUE.&quot; Fujin screamed, helping her stand.

The ship jolted sharply and tottered to one side.

&quot;We hit something!&quot; Ayane shouted loudly. A sickening crunch sounded and 
a huge crack slashed its way across the shield. Immediately thin streams 
of water began to spray into the chamber.

&quot;NO!&quot; Fujin shouted, rushing forward. Reacting quickly she summoned 
Pandemonia. In an instant, the towering guardian appeared amid a large 
whirlwind and landed on the deck. &quot;HOLD IT!&quot; Fujin screamed as the 
shield began to crush inwards.

The shocked look on what passed for Pandemonia&#146;s face would have been 
amusing in any other circumstance. Outstretching it&#146;s arms the guardian 
began to let loose a torrent of wind stronger than any storm. While 
normally wild and destructive the Guardian had to use its powers with 
the precision of a surgeon to counteract the forces threatening to 
shatter the shield.

&quot;GET BACK!&quot; Fujin shouted, gesturing wildly as the hellish windstorm had 
the desired effect even though it was only slowing the inevitable. The 
backlash for the howling storm nearly swept Nicole away but quick action 
on Zell and Xu&#146;s part saved her.

Spent, Rinoa finally staggered once, then collapsed into 
unconsciousness.

&quot;Rinoa!&quot; Squall shouted rushing forward to pull her to safety. Leaving 
Quistis to struggle on through sheer force of will.

&quot;I&#146;m connected!&quot; Ellone screamed over the windstorm. &quot;I can hear her... 
she&#146;s scared. She wants us to save her!&quot;

&quot;Do you have control!?&quot; Quistis shouted, her features drawn.

&quot;Yes, but what do I do?&quot; Ellone screamed.

Running forward into the wind. Zell all but threw himself headfirst into 
her lap and with a wild scream pulled hard on the control stick. As 
hoped their decent slowed but did not stop. Quistis&#146; power was quickly 
fading and her glow began to dim, even as Pandemonia too struggled to 
keep going.

&quot;We&#146;re not going to make it are we?&quot; Xu asked Odine darkly as the 
moments ticked by. His expression grim, the doctor shook his head sadly. 
Seconds began to turn into minutes, and finally the deadfall stopped 
then after a brief moment, they began to rise.

 Irvine was the first to show his joy and hooted loudly. Xu shoved him 
and bid him to be silent.

&quot;We&#146;re not out of this yes, don&#146;t distract them.&quot;

&quot;ALMOST THERE!&quot; Fujin called to Quistis who screamed in pain as she 
fought to remain standing.

&quot;21,000 Feet!&quot; Zell shouted thankfully. Breathing a sigh of relief 
Quistis already could feel the stresses lightening but fought onward 
until positive that Eden&#146;s restorative powers could take over. More time 
passed and finally, unable to keep going, Pandemonia let out a tortured 
bellow. Collapsing forward in exhaustion the Guardian quickly faded from 
view. Seconds later, Quistis&#146; glow abruptly vanished. Smiling serenely, 
her gaze met Fujin&#146;s, then, without a word, she collapsed.

************************

When she awoke, she found Fujin hovering over her protectively.

&quot;Ugh... what happened?&quot; She groaned sitting up. &quot;Are we okay, where are 
we?&quot;

&quot;FINE, INFIRMARY.&quot;

&quot;How long?&quot;

&quot;HOUR.&quot;

&quot;Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;YES.&quot; Fujin grinned, brushing a hand through her hair. Turning her head 
Quistis and noticed Rinoa sitting up and drinking a cup of cocoa with 
Squall at her side.

&quot;Eden?&quot;

&quot;HEALING.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m so tired...&quot;

&quot;DID A LOT.&quot; Fujin whispered, wiping her brow with a moist towel.

&quot;Are you sure everyone is okay?&quot;

&quot;We&#146;re all fine.&quot; Cid assured her, walking through the doorway with 
Laguna and Kiros. &quot;Though I don&#146;t think Nicole will want to tag along on 
any more adventures.&quot;

&quot;Where is she?&quot;

&quot;On the bridge with Naomi and Ayane.&quot;

&quot;And Ellone?&quot;

&quot;In the core, consoling Eden.&quot;

&quot;Have we surfaced?&quot;

&quot;Not yet, we&#146;re taking it slow.&quot;

&quot;EDEN HEALING.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s good; I&#146;d hate things to fall apart before we get the hell out 
of here.&quot;

&quot;Quistis.&quot; Laguna coughed, getting her attention.

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;I just wanted to say, I&#146;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot;

&quot;All of this, Squall was right, it&#146;s my fault.&quot; He admitted sadly.

&quot;We all came through it okay, that&#146;s all that matters.&quot; Quistis yawned. 
&quot;Gracious I&#146;m starving; does this heap have a working cafeteria?&quot;

&quot;I have no idea.&quot; Cid smiled.

&quot;Well perhaps Eden can grow you something.&quot; Rinoa suggested jokingly.

&quot;Ew gross...&quot; Quistis gagged.

&quot;Hi Hi!&quot; Selphie beamed, poking her head into the infirmary.

&quot;Hey there, you okay?&quot; Quistis smiled.

&quot;Yeah, just bumps an bruises.&quot; Selphie replied hugging her tightly.

&quot;Hey Trepe, I have to say this was some hell of an open house.&quot; Xu 
laughed, following Selphie&#146;s lead.

&quot;Yeah no kidding.&quot; Quistis laughed. &quot;Hey, where are Zell and Irvine?&quot;

&quot;Oh they&#146;re off exploring, you know how they are.&quot; Selphie shrugged.

Quistis rested her head on Fujin&#146;s shoulder and stifled another yawn.

&quot;So, what&#146;s the plan?&quot; Squall asked curiously.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Quistis responded, glancing at him curiously.

&quot;About being headmaster?&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re joking?&quot;

&quot;The Garden is viable; Ellone has been in constant contact with Eden 
since we brought you here.&quot; Cid explained.

&quot;You&#146;re kidding.&quot; Quistis scoffed.

&quot;Odine says the only reason this happened was because of sensory 
overload. She simply wasn&#146;t ready for such much input from a corporeal 
source.&quot;

&quot;Is that supposed to comfort me?&quot; Quistis scowled.

&quot;Eden has apologized for all the trouble.&quot;

&quot;I can&#146;t believe you&#146;re even considering doing this.&quot;

&quot;What would you have us do, kill it.&quot;

&quot;GOOD START.&quot; Fujin brooded.

&quot;Fujin...&quot; Quistis sighed then looked to Cid. &quot;No, it&#146;s not her 
fault...&quot;

&quot;She&#146;ll need guidance. Think of her as one of your new students.&quot;

&quot;Cid, come on, that&#146;s ridiculous we&#146;re talking about an entity the size 
of a small town.&quot;

&quot;You know what I mean. Think of it as a test of your teaching 
abilities.&quot;

&quot;What if she, it, looses control again, or worse yet, goes berserk.&quot;

&quot;Ellone tells me Eden really wants this to work, she even allowed a fail 
safe in the core.&quot;

&quot;Fail safe?&quot;

&quot;An explosive device...&quot; Laguna said.

&quot;Okay now I know you&#146;re both crazy.&quot;

&quot;It was Eden&#146;s idea before she was even bonded.&quot;

&quot;Of course, all she&#146;d have to do is absorb it.&quot;

&quot;Actually no, Odine said there are only certain materials it can absorb 
and affect. The device was made from resistant alloys.&quot; Kiros explained.

&quot;Still...what happens then, we blow the core and we&#146;re out of control? 
What if we&#146;re in the air, or in the ocean again? We&#146;re dead.&quot;

&quot;The Garden&#146;s superstructure and mundane drives are partially 
independent from Eden, once out of the way, it should be no different 
than Balamb to control.&quot; Kiros continued.

&quot;How do you know all of this?&quot;

&quot;I&#146;ve been...talking...to the good doctor. He&#146;s been most cooperative in 
light of what happened.&quot; Kiros grinned wickedly.

&quot;I don&#146;t know it&#146;s weird, really weird. The students won&#146;t like it; it&#146;s 
bad enough when security is lurking around, I can just imagine what 
they&#146;d say if they knew the walls had eyes.&quot;

&quot;Again, Odine says the superstructure was already in place that includes 
the various rooms, compartments and critical structures. Eden should 
have little control over the original layout of the garden.&quot; Kiros 
continued, then held up a phonebook sized book. &quot;This journal details 
every step of the experiment as well as various safe guards and systems. 
For example, Eden can tap into any standard security device in the 
garden including the so-called Free Areas like residential and command. 
But those links can be closed on command via security protocols; all 
said and done, you will have complete control. In fact, if we&#146;d known 
all this earlier a simple command would have saved us all this trouble.&quot;

&quot;Remind me to thank Odine, where is he now?&quot;

&quot;Brig.&quot; Laguna said blandly.

&quot;What do you think?&quot; Cid shrugged.

&quot;About?&quot;

&quot;Care to give it a try?&quot;

&quot;I... I don&#146;t know... It sounds insane to me.&quot; Quistis admitted.

&quot;Quisty...&quot; Ellone mumbled quietly, announcing her presence.

&quot;Ellone, there you are. Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;Yeah I&#146;m fine; I&#146;ve been talking to Eden.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so what&#146;s she say?&quot;

&quot;She wants you to know how sorry she is and that if you give this a 
chance, she thinks it will be a good experience for all of us.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t know... Fu? What do you think?&quot;

&quot;NUTS.&quot; Fujin snorted derisively then shrugged. &quot;BUT NOTHING NEW.&quot;

&quot;Is that a go for it?&quot;

&quot;UP TO YOU.&quot;

&quot;Damn...&quot; Quistis groaned then rubbed her face. &quot;Okay... fine, but so 
help me...&quot;

&quot;You don&#146;t have to say a thing.&quot; Cid nodded. &quot;We&#146;ll support any decision 
you make.&quot;

&quot;Okay then...&quot; Quistis nodded cautiously. &quot;What do I need to do?&quot;

&quot;Well, first.&quot; Kiros grinned. &quot;I suggest you study this.&quot; He said, 
plopping the massive booklet into her lap.

&quot;Gods...&quot; Quistis whined. &quot;I&#146;m going to regret this, I know it.&quot;

&quot;Quisty, I have a favor to ask.&quot; Ellone asked sheepishly.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I want to stay on board.&quot;

&quot;You do? Even after all that happened. I figured you&#146;d be the first one 
to leave.&quot;

&quot;No, actually, I think I can help.&quot;

&quot;Oh you do?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I think Eden and I are getting along well, I think she likes me.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s a good thing I think... Um, sure, I suppose; but you&#146;d have to 
ask Laguna.&quot;

Clapping with glee Ellone turned to her father who held up his hands to 
block any overzealous pleading. &quot;You have my blessing.&quot; He chuckled.

**********************

It was late in the evening by the time Eden had regenerated enough to 
resume a leisurely course back to Esthar. Traveling across the water, 
the massive garden&#146;s dimensions changed. The large central spire that 
usually hung under Eden folded back until it trailed behind the garden. 
The configuration served dual purposes, primarily to keep the delicate 
sensory and engine systems from dragging the seafloor and secondly to 
help steering by acting like a giant rudder.

During the slow journey back, everyone killed time in his or her own 
way. Cid, Laguna and Kiros sat conversing sharply with Odine; the doctor 
would have to be dealt with in some fashion. His irresponsible actions 
were intolerable but the facts remained. He had helped them numerous 
times before, but yet, he&#146;d also put untold lives at risk with his 
various wild experiments. Whatever the outcome, it would not come easy 
for any of them. Still weakened from her expenditures, Rinoa decided to 
catch some sleep in the infirmary while Squall watched quietly over her.

Zell and Irvine, their explorations complete, lured the others to a 
large enclosed park, similar in size to Balamb&#146;s former training center. 
However, a brief reconnaissance showed that unlike Balamb this park was 
devoid of hostile life. Only the odd toad, bug or songbird could be 
seen. A winding stream made its way through the park, branching off into 
several tributaries and then vanishing into tunnels along the walls. The 
whole system was feed by a natural looking spring at the heart of the 
place. The odd boulder or fallen log dotted the clearing around the 
spring as well as a few picnic tables and waste cans.

&quot;I like this.&quot; Quistis smiled, walking into the clearing, her bare feet 
crunching lightly through fallen leaves and brush.

&quot;I do too.&quot; Xu agreed, looking up through transparent dome above their 
heads. The park was nestled atop the Garden allowing for an unobstructed 
view of the heavens. Though not open to the outside, a seemingly natural 
breeze filtered through the trees and underbrush from silent, unseen air 
filters hidden amongst the artificial cliffs surround the park. Though 
mostly undamaged, some areas showed signs of the near disaster; large 
cracks in the dome could be seen slowly shrinking away and some areas 
where covered in mud from water kicked up during the turmoil.

&quot;I don&#146;t know...&quot; Selphie mused. &quot;It&#146;s kind of creepy to be inside 
something living.

&quot;I agree.&quot; Irvine nodded darkly then shrugged. &quot;But I have to admit, the 
place looks nice.&quot;

&quot;Well, not everything is part of Eden though.&quot; Nicole said, looking at 
Quistis. &quot;Isn&#146;t that right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that&#146;s what the records say.&quot; Quistis nodded, holding up the 
thick journal.

&quot;I can&#146;t wait till you take her into space.&quot; Naomi chirped excitedly.

&quot;What?&quot; Xu gawked.

&quot;This thing can go into space?&quot; Zell blurted. &quot;Too cool!&quot;

&quot;An all terrain, multipurpose platform.&quot; Naomi recited. &quot;That&#146;s what Mr. 
Kramer and Loire requested.&quot;

&quot;Wow.&quot; Ellone said quietly.

&quot;Still sounds flaky to me, I&#146;m sorry.&quot; Irvine frowned. &quot;This whole idea 
seems... I dunno... bad.&quot;

&quot;So when do the students arrive?&quot; Nicole asked, not wanting to dwell on 
the negative.

&quot;Um... I&#146;m not sure, probably once we&#146;ve had inspections and a news 
briefing. I&#146;m sure there is a ton of public relations and inspections to 
do before anyone will agree to send their kids to a place like this. 
Quistis admitted.

&quot;I wish Celest could see this.&quot; Zell grinned as they all sat down. 
&quot;She&#146;d love it.&quot;

&quot;We&#146;ve been trying to contact them but they move around so much it&#146;s 
hard to get a message through.&quot; Quistis shrugged.

&quot;You&#146;d think they&#146;d carry a communicator or something...I mean hell 
doesn&#146;t that heap they&#146;re farting around in have a radio?&quot; Zell groused.

&quot;DEATHTRAP.&quot; Fujin grunted, remembering the patchwork shuttle Raijin had 
arrived in.

&quot;Well you know how he&#146;s been lately; he&#146;s really buying into that back 
to nature mentality.&quot;

&quot;I think he just wants to avoid being tracked. Between him and Seifer, 
they&#146;re not going to be too welcome in some areas.&quot; Selphie commented 
the folded her arms in grim thought. &quot;Ward better not keep Edea up with 
those freaky puppets.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis stammered caught of guard by the change of subject.

&quot;Who&#146;s Edea?&quot; Ayane asked, having kept quiet through most of the 
conversation.

&quot;Her baby.&quot; Nicole explained.

&quot;Those hand puppets.&quot; Selphie explained, gesturing creepily with her 
hands.

&quot;Hand puppets?&quot; Xu blinked, an amused look on her face.

Ellone&#146;s expression broadened into a huge grin before she exploded into 
reminiscing babble.

&quot;Oh, oh I remember those, I loved those things. Mr. Chin Chin and 
Bubbles, oh it was hilarious! One time, Chin Chin found a magic hammer 
and Farmer Mc Noodle was waving his little arm...&quot; She paused, noticing 
everyone staring blankly at her. &quot;And...um...&quot; She stumbled. &quot;Um... it 
was a long time ago; you&#146;d have to had been there.&quot; More silence. &quot;I&#146;m 
going to go to the soda machine? Anyone thirsty?&quot; She offered meekly, 
her cheeks flush with embarrassment.&quot;

&quot;No thanks.&quot; Quistis smiled sympathetically before Ellone scurried 
quickly away. Sitting in wonder a moment, Selphie made a face then 
looked to Nicole.

&quot;What was I saying?&quot;

&quot;Edea.&quot; Nicole reminded her.

&quot;Oh, yeah, I was just saying... he better not keep her up, she&#146;s cranky 
as all heck when tired...&quot;

&quot;So are you.&quot; Irvine mumbled under his breath.

Casually, Selphie smacked lightly.

&quot;Ya know.&quot; Zell smiled, sitting back on his hands thoughtfully. 
&quot;Selphie, you remember that time you borrowed Eden from Squall.&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; Selphie blurted instantly.

&quot;What?&quot; Irvine asked, intrigued.

&quot;Oh goodness...&quot; Quistis winced.

&quot;Oh, oh, there&#146;s a story here.&quot; Xu smiled wickedly. &quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;Zell don&#146;t you do it?&quot;

&quot;Do what? It was funny.&quot; He cackled.

&quot;No it wasn&#146;t! You promised you&#146;d never tell anyone!&quot; Selphie screeched, 
jumping up to silence him.

&quot;What are they talking about?&quot; Naomi asked Quistis curiously.

&quot;Just listen.&quot; Quistis grinned.

&quot;That was Miss Trepe, I didn&#146;t promise anything!&quot; Zell laughed, 
scurrying away on hands and knees as she grabbed his ankles.

&quot;Aw come on, let him tell!&quot; Ayane protested, curious to see hear what 
the fuss was about.

&quot;You stay out of this; you don&#146;t even know what we&#146;re talking about!&quot;  
Selphie spouted indignantly.

&quot;Fiery little thing isn&#146;t she?&quot; Ayane smirked in surprise.

&quot;HAVE NO IDEA.&quot; Fujin said blandly.

&quot;Okay, okay!&quot; Zell chattered as he freed himself then jumped atop a 
picnic table. &quot;This is what happened; there was a T-Rexsaur in the 
training center that&#146;d been really giving the students trouble, so Miss 
Trepe gathered Selphie and me to take care of it.&quot; He started then 
bolted anew as she gave chase. After a bout of running around, he 
finally found a brief refuge behind Fujin who&#146;s expression was enough to 
give the tiny terror pause.

&quot;So, she has Eden and she sets up the junction and heads off to the 
training center.&quot;

&quot;Zell!&quot; Selphie shouted in protest.

&quot;And?&quot; Xu prodded eagerly.

&quot;Well, she&#146;s complaining and what not, apparently Eden didn&#146;t like her 
to much for whatever reason so they were at odds.&quot;

&quot;Is that dangerous?&quot; Naomi frowned, not seeing the humor in it.

&quot;Not really, well not for her anyway.&quot; Zell giggled. &quot;And there in lies 
the story!&quot;

&quot;Shut up, or so help me!&quot; Selphie shrieked then lunged around Fujin to 
grab at him, only to have him escape. Stumbling in the leaves, Selphie 
cursed a string of unflattering obscenities before giving chase once 
more.

 Having bought more time for his tale, Zell continued.

&quot;Anyway, we&#146;re out looking and the T-Rexsaur comes through the brush and 
attacks us.&quot;

&quot;What&#146;s a T-Rexsaur?&quot; Ayane asked as Zell began running again.

&quot;A big giant dinosaur!&quot; Zell answered, hurrying behind Irvine who 
quickly shouldered him away.

&quot;Don&#146;t come to me, I&#146;m not helping.&quot; He blurted as Zell cleared enough 
distance to continue.

&quot;So, here we are, and all of a sudden, Selphie makes this noise and 
leaps at the thing, without her weapons drawn or anything.&quot;

&quot;Goodness...&quot; Ellone gawked.

&quot;So what happened?&quot; Naomi asked, intensely curious.

&quot;Don&#146;t you do it Zell I mean it!&quot; Selphie shouted, stamping her foot.

&quot;Do what? Tell them that you ate the damned thing?&quot; He laughed aloud.

&quot;She what!?&quot; Irinve sputtered.

Quistis groaned and rubbed her temples.

&quot;She did not!&quot; Naomi laughed.

&quot;Oh yes she did, it was disgusting...&quot; Zell said in awe.

&quot;I&#146;ve never seen anything like it in my life...it happened to fast, 
ugh... the noise...&quot; Quistis said quietly, mortified at the memory.

Selphie screamed in dismay and put her hands to her ears.

&quot;It wasn&#146;t my fault!&quot;

&quot;She ate it!?&quot; Ellone repeated in disbelief.

&quot;The whole, thing...&quot; Zell nodded.

&quot;I couldn&#146;t help myself!&quot; Selphie shouted in embarrassment.

&quot;I don&#146;t believe it.&quot; Ayane said flatly.

&quot;Believe it.&quot; Quistis said grimly.

&quot;Shut up!&quot; Selphie protested.

&quot;How?&quot; Xu asked, trying to wrap her mind around the sheer physics of it. 
&quot;Those things are like forty feet long.&quot;

&quot;I have a suggestion.&quot; Irvine started with a dirty grin before Selphie 
smacked him silent.

&quot;It was something Eden did to her, that&#146;s all we could gather.&quot; Quistis 
snickered.

&quot;That is so nasty...&quot; Nicole mumbled, making a face.

&quot;The poor thing...&quot; Ellone frowned.

&quot;What!?&quot; Selphie shouted in outrage. &quot;I&#146;m the one that got turned into a 
freak show!&quot;

Unable to withstand the mental image of the situation Fujin exploded 
into laughter.

&quot;What the heck are you laughing at!&quot; Selphie whined, scooping up a grass 
clod and flinging it at her. This merely trigged the wholesale guffaws 
of those present. &quot;Oh! You&#146;re all horrible!&quot; Selphie pouted stamping up 
and down in a fit before storming off.

&quot;No, wait Selphie...&quot; Quistis choked trying to compose herself.

&quot;Zell, oh, she&#146;s going to get you...&quot; Irvine snickered in spite of 
himself.

&quot;Ah who cares, it was worth it.&quot; Zell chuckled.

&quot;So this is what you people do for fun?&quot; Ayane asked quietly an amused 
twinkle in her eyes.

***********

It was early in the morning hours by the time Eden arrived in Esthar, 
where it took up position just outside city limits. A host of security 
was waiting and escorted Laguna, Kiros and Odine back to the safety of 
the Presidential Estate. Naomi&#146;s father and his bodyguards were waiting 
as well, and Naomi perked up noticeably at the sight of him.

&quot;Daddy!&quot; She giggled happily, throwing her arms around his neck.

&quot;Hey guys, this is my papa.&quot; She beamed. Alexander Jennings was a tall 
handsome man in his late forties, clean-shaven, well groomed, with 
piercing dark eyes and killer smile. His hair, cut in a no nonsense 
style favored by politicians, was dark with distinguishing hints of 
gray, overall, he looked like someone who&#146;d run for president.

&quot;Quistis Trepe, pleased to meet you Mr. Jennings.&quot; Quistis smiled, 
shaking his hand.

&quot;Professor Trepe, you must be the young lady everyone is going on about. 
Please, call me Alex.&quot;

&quot;Professor Trepe.&quot; Xu giggled to Fujin who smiled faintly.

&quot;Alex, there you are.&quot; Cid smiled, making his way forward. &quot;I must 
apologize for the abrupt departure earlier.&quot;

&quot;No, I&#146;m the one to apologize, I&#146;m just thankful that everyone is 
alright.&quot;

&quot;I bet this turned out to be a media nightmare eh Alex.&quot; Ayane quipped 
in a surprisingly crass tone.

&quot;Indeed...&quot; The older Jennings frowned, then turned back to face 
Quistis.

&quot;So Miss Trepe, tell me about yourself? I&#146;d like to know a little bit 
about who we&#146;re turning Esthar Garden over to.&quot;

&quot;Well.&quot; Quistis stumbled slightly. Not really in the mood to be 
interrogated, especially in the early hours of the morning. &quot;What would 
you like to know?&quot;

&quot;Married, have any kids?&quot;

&quot;Dad, please.&quot; Naomi cringed.

&quot;What?&quot; Alex huffed, looking curiously at his daughter.

&quot;I don&#146;t have any children yet. Quistis answered partially.

&quot;YET?&quot; Fujin blurted curiously.

&quot;Oh hey!&quot; Rinoa all but shouted, lunging forward. &quot;Mr. Jennings, 
remember me!?&quot;

&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot; He asked curiously as she grabbed his hand.

&quot;Rinoa. Rinoa Leonhart err well Heartilly last time you saw me.&quot;

&quot;Oh, General Caroway&#146;s daughter. Yes, I remember you; it&#146;s been what? 
Ten years?&quot;

&quot;Just about.&quot; Rinoa beamed, winking at Quistis.

&quot;Look how you&#146;ve grown, you look just like your mother. So then, it was 
you causing that all that trouble in Timber a few years ago.&quot;

&quot;Um yep.&quot; Rinoa frowned slightly. &quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;Hardly, if anything I have to say thank you, you guys were a great 
source of revenue.&quot;

&quot;People dying, wars, loss of family and homes...its good for business.&quot; 
Ayane grumbled, earning a scathing glance from the man.

&quot;Ahem.&quot; Cid coughed. &quot;Alex, we&#146;re heading back to Balamb, if you don&#146;t 
mind accompanying us there are some things I&#146;d like to discuss with 
you.&quot;

&quot;Very well. Naomi, say bye to your friends we&#146;re leaving. Professor 
Trepe, it was a pleasure meeting you; I look forward to talking with you 
again.&quot; He said evenly then started walking towards the waiting Ragnarok 
with Cid.

&quot;Okay...&quot; Naomi nodded solemnly then perked up brightly. &quot;Oh!&quot; She 
shouted before rushing off towards her father&#146;s limousine.

&quot;We&#146;ll I guess that means we&#146;re leaving.&quot; Zell shrugged then hugged 
Quistis tightly.

&quot;You sure you want to spend the night here?&quot; Nicole asked curiously.

&quot;Yeah, the place gives me the creeps so I need to go ahead and get it 
out of my system.&quot;

&quot;Aw, isn&#146;t she a trooper.&quot; Xu giggled. &quot;Beware of ghosts.&quot;

&quot;Cute...&quot;

&quot;We&#146;ll come back tomorrow and help get things set up.&quot; Squall explained, 
putting a hand on her shoulder.

&quot;Thanks, you guys get some sleep.&quot;

&quot;See you tomorrow!&quot; Selphie waved then shouted in shock as Irvine 
scooped her up and ran for the Ragnarok.

&quot;RETARDED.&quot; Fujin noted, giving them a sour glance.

Squall nodded in quiet agreement then looked to Ellone curiously.

&quot;You coming?&quot;

&quot;No, I think I&#146;ll stay here tonight.&quot; She answered with a small smile.

&quot;All right then.&quot; He nodded then motioned to Rinoa.

&quot;Bye guys.&quot; She waved then followed Squall.

&quot;Goodnight.&quot; Quistis called out.

&quot;Naomi!&quot; Alexander called out, wishing her to hurry.

&quot;I sense some hostility between you and Mr. Jennings.&quot; Quistis asked 
Ayane quietly as they waited.

&quot;You could say that.&quot; Ayane mused evasively.

&quot;DO NO TRUST.&quot; Fujin commented, as Naomi hurried back with a package.

&quot;Good, you shouldn&#146;t&quot; Ayane frowned.

&quot;Fuji! Here I brought you something.&quot; Naomi giggled, holding up a long 
cylindrical tube.

&quot;FOR ME?&quot; Fujin mumbled, in confusion.

&quot;Oh, what is it?&quot; Quistis grinned curiously.

&quot;Naomi! It&#146;s time to go!&quot; Alexander shouted again, this time 
impatiently.

&quot;Damn, sorry guys I have to go now, I hope you like the gift, Bye!&quot; She 
blurted hurriedly then rushed off.

&quot;See ya.&quot; Ayane nodded, then followed.

 As the Ragnarok lifted off Quistis, Fujin and Ellone watched shrink 
into the distance. They waited until Alexander&#146;s security team drove 
away before heading back Eden. As they approached, Quistis made a face.

&quot;Um...&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Ellone asked.

&quot;We took the Ragnarok out, how are we supposed to get back aboard?&quot; 
Quistis asked, feeling somewhat foolish.

&quot;Oh my...&quot; Ellone gasped, looking up at Eden which hovered high above 
there heads.

&quot;TYPICAL.&quot; Fujin huffed then jumped slightly as a glowing runic circle 
formed under their feet.

Ellone yelped in fright and Quistis looked around curiously as the 
circle hummed loudly before enveloping them in a blinding white light.

A feeling of acceleration accosted them briefly then the light faded. 
All three were somewhat startled to find that their location had 
changed. Fujin looked around in confusion and Ellone looked ready to 
vomit.

&quot;Okay...&quot; Quistis said quietly. &quot;That was new...&quot;

&quot;I think I&#146;m going to be sick...&quot; Ellone whimpered.

&quot;WHERE?&quot; Fujin asked, taking in their surroundings, while Quistis rubbed 
Ellone&#146;s back in hopes of comforting her.

&quot;Arrival area.&quot; Quistis noted, pointing to a sign on a near wall.

&quot;STUDENTS WILL DISLIKE.&quot; Fujin commented, feeling queasy herself.

&quot;Hopefully, that&#146;s not normal...&quot; Ellone frowned.

&quot;I don&#146;t think so.&quot; Quistis surmised. &quot;Eden says that there are shuttles 
meant to ferry people to the surface.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re in contact now?&quot; Ellone asked curiously.

&quot;Somewhat, now that I know what to look for, I can feel her presence 
everywhere, especially in area&#146;s fully under her control.&quot; Quistis 
explained.

&quot;Aw! You&#146;ll have to teach me how to do that; I can only hear her on the 
bridge or in the core.

&quot;I don&#146;t know if I can Ellone, our powers, while similar have major 
differences. See, from what I&#146;ve gathered, our abilities stem from the 
skills we had before. For example, I&#146;ve always been able to synchronize 
with things. That&#146;s why I can mimic various powers I&#146;ve encountered over 
the years, and most likely why I can hear Eden so clearly now. &quot; Quistis 
explained regretfully. You powers will in all likelihood focus on 
chronometric shifts... and temporal perceptions.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin gawked at the techno babble.

&quot;Time related.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;Oh...&quot; Ellone frowned, clearly disappointed.

&quot;But, I could be wrong, so we&#146;ll try.&quot; Quistis quickly added, hoping to 
cheer her up.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Ellone smiled. &quot;Ya know, I think we&#146;re going to have fun.&quot; She 
beamed. Then with curiosity getting the better of her, she turned to 
Fujin.

&quot;Well?&quot;

&quot;WELL WHAT?&quot; Fujin yawned.

&quot;You know.&quot; Ellone giggled, nodding at the present.

&quot;Yeah really, what was that about is there something I should know about 
you and Naomi?&quot;

&quot;TORRID AFFAIR.&quot; Fujin said blandly.

&quot;Cute.&quot; Scowled playfully.

&quot;Come on what is it?&quot; Ellone giggled.

&quot;TIRED.&quot; Fujin said sleepily.

&quot;Fu!&quot; Quistis prodded in shock. &quot;Would you open it already, we&#146;re dying 
here.&quot;

&quot;FINE.&quot; She grinned then popped the end off the tube. Carefully, she 
fished around until she slipped a rolled up painting out. Unfurling it, 
Fujin looked in surprise, it was the painting she&#146;d seen hanging in 
Naomi&#146;s suite.

&quot;Aw...&quot; Quistis marveled. &quot;Is that you and Raijin?&quot;

&quot;YES...&quot; Fujin muttered, her heart in her throat.

&quot;Neat, who painted it?&quot; Ellone asked, peering curiously.

&quot;...mother...&quot; Fujin said quietly then returned the painting to the tube 
for safekeeping.

&quot;Where in the world did Naomi find that?&quot; Quistis asked.

&quot;HAD IN SUITE.&quot; Fujin explained. &quot;FATHER, COLLECTOR.&quot;

&quot;Ah, that explains why you were being weird that night.&quot;

&quot;That is so sweet!&quot; Ellone smiled, wiping her eyes.

&quot;And you were so mean to her too.&quot; Quistis teased Fujin playfully.

&quot;WAS NOT.&quot;

&quot;You were too, and rude.&quot;

&quot;NOT RUDE.&quot;

&quot;I think you should make it up to her.&quot;

&quot;WILL GIVE THANKS.&quot; Fujin nodded sourly before heading towards the 
nearest elevator.

&quot;Where are you going silly?&quot; Quistis laughed.

&quot;CREW QUARTERS.&quot;

&quot;You don&#146;t even know which way to go.&quot;

Fujin paused and stood a moment, her back to them. Turning around, she 
frowned in annoyance.

&quot;This way.&quot; Quistis giggled, nodding towards one of the tram stations.&quot;

Skipping cheerfully, Ellone was first one aboard, while Fujin stubbornly 
took her time.

 A brief trip later, the trio arrived in the residential quarters and 
looked around.

&quot;MAZE...&quot; Fujin groaned, wanting nothing more than to get some sleep. 
Quistis too looked somewhat haggard, all but exhausted from her earlier 
expenditures.

&quot;There should be a section for staff members right up ahead.&quot; She noted, 
thumbing through Odine&#146;s journal.

&quot;I don&#146;t know if I could sleep if I tried.&quot; Ellone sighed.

&quot;SPEAK FOR SELF.&quot; Fujin yawned anew.

&quot;Really, I&#146;m running on fumes...&quot; Quistis mumbled, then perked up. &quot;Oh 
here we go. Senior staff.&quot;

Glancing around, Quistis found the door she was looking for, only to 
discover it was locked.

&quot;Oh come on...&quot; She groaned.

Fujin swiftly kicked it in causing Ellone to jump.

&quot;That works I guess.&quot; Quistis blinked. &quot;You know you&#146;ll have to fix that 
later.&quot; She then grinned stepping inside.

&quot;REGENERATE.&quot; Fujin smiled.

&quot;Eden doesn&#146;t have control here.&quot; Ellone smiled back. &quot;I think I saw a 
toolset on the bridge.&quot; She giggled.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin frowned in dismay.

&quot;She&#146;s right love, you need to pay attention.&quot; Quistis laughed, waving a 
finger at her.

&quot;DAMN...&quot; Fujin hissed under her breath, looking at the door.

Quistis stretched her arms out over her head and let out a yawn.

&quot;Okay girls, I&#146;m crashing.&quot; She said evenly. &quot;Ellone, you can sleep here 
if you don&#146;t want to stay by yourself. It looks like there is plenty of 
room.&quot; She offered, looking around the large, but reasonable apartment. 
&quot;Ah.&quot; She smiled, glancing through a doorway. &quot;There&#146;s a guest room.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Ellone smiled brightly then all but ran into the room. &quot;Night! 
You two, see you in the morning.&quot; She waved then shut the door.

&quot;IS MORNING.&quot; Fujin grumbled irritably.

&quot;You&#146;re cranky; I think you need a nappy.&quot; Quistis smiled playfully, 
walking towards her. &quot;Come on.&quot; She sighed dreamily, taking her hand. 
&quot;Lets get some sleep.&quot;

****************

Morning found Quistis sleeping in while Fujin took the opportunity to 
familiarize herself with her surroundings. The apartment came with basic 
furniture though she was certain Quistis would toss it all out and 
refurbish the place to suit her. Nosing around the apartment, she found 
a study, complete with copies of Odine&#146;s construction journal. Other 
books lay scattered as well, having toppled from the surrounding 
bookshelves during the crisis. Several vacuum-sealed plastic clothing 
bags lay strew about as well. All of them bore the labels of renowned 
fashion designers. Glancing curiously through the pile, she realized 
they were samples of potential school uniforms.

&quot;What do you have there?&quot; Quistis asked, startling her.

&quot;SNEAKY.&quot; Fujin smirked, glancing at her from over her shoulder.

&quot;You&#146;ve had it coming.&quot; Quistis smiled, walking forward to hug her from 
behind.

&quot;UNIFORMS.&quot; Fujin replied, answering her question.

&quot;Nice, I guess, we&#146;re supposed to pick one.&quot;

&quot;WE?&quot;

&quot;What, you figured I&#146;m doing all this by myself?&quot;

&quot;YES.&quot;

&quot;Please.&quot; Quistis huffed. &quot;I&#146;m not about to let you lounge around and do 
nothing.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m joking, calm down. Seriously though, I&#146;d like your input on 
things.&quot;

&quot;VERY WELL.&quot;

&quot;Also... We&#146;ll need a field leader.&quot;

&quot;FIELD LEADER?&quot;

&quot;Like Squall, someone in charge of the SEED teams?&quot;

&quot;WHO?&quot;

&quot;Well you for starters.&quot;

&quot;ME?&quot;

&quot;Yes you.&quot;

&quot;BAD IDEA...&quot;

&quot;Nonsense. I&#146;ve seen you in action; you&#146;re a natural leader. Hell, you 
took over a town for crying aloud.&quot;

&quot;UNWELCOME REMINDER...&quot;

&quot;Sorry, but you know I&#146;m right.&quot;

&quot;NOT SOCIAL.&quot;

&quot;Duh, like Squall is?&quot;

&quot;POINT.&quot;

&quot;Come now, this isn&#146;t like you, you&#146;re not one to suffer from self 
doubt. If you don&#146;t want to do it then just say so.&quot;

&quot;MISUNDERSTAND.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Then explain.&quot;

&quot;EMOTIONAL DECISION?&quot;

&quot;What!? Okay that&#146;s insulting.&quot;

&quot;APOLOGY...&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re forgiven. And no, I put some thought into this.&quot;

&quot;ZELL?&quot;

&quot;Zell, what about him?&quot;

&quot;OPTION?&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re being funny... I love Zell like a brother but he&#146;s not 
leadership material and he knows it.&quot;

&quot;TRUE...&quot;

&quot;And don&#146;t say Irvine. He&#146;s prone freezing up in a crisis; remind me to 
tell you about what happened in Deling. Selphie can&#146;t for obvious 
reasons, that and she&#146;s not remotely qualified, neither is Rinoa. So it 
falls to you my dear.&quot;

&quot;VERY WELL.&quot; Fujin nodded appreciably.

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Well that was easier than I expected.&quot; Quistis grinned.

&quot;SO LONG AS SURE.&quot;

&quot;I am, thanks.&quot;

&quot;PLEASURE.&quot;

&quot;Blah, blah, blah, you people get up to early.&quot; Ellone yawned from the 
doorway.

&quot;Morning sleepy head.&quot; Quistis grinned, turning to face her.

&quot;I&#146;m hungry.&quot;

&quot;Yeah me too. Lets get something to eat and freshen up then we&#146;ll head 
to the bridge; we&#146;ve got a lot to do today.&quot;

 After their meal and showers, the women made their way to the bridge. 
Everything seemed normal and it appeared repairs were complete.

Settling down into the captain&#146;s chair, Quistis looked around peaceably.

&quot;I could get used to this.&quot; She mused then toyed with the control panel 
in front of her. The chair hummed slightly then rose upwards on the 
crane like arm. Startled, Ellone let out a yelp.

&quot;WHAT DOING?&quot; Fujin grinned up as Quistis leaned forward to look around.

&quot;Getting a better view.&quot; She chuckled. At her unique vantage point she 
was offered a complete holographic representation of everything 
surrounding Eden.

&quot;This is interesting.&quot; She mumbled absently then browsed through the 
manual. &quot;I have control the entire garden from here. But usually things 
are run from substations. Let&#146;s see, oh...weapons systems...&quot;

&quot;WEAPONS?&quot; Fujin chirped; her curiosity piqued.

&quot;Well...I guess it&#146;s best to be able to defend yourself.&quot; Ellone said 
quietly.

&quot;A lot of this is magically based... drawn from Eden itself. Along with 
standard weaponry and Triad Phase Cannons... What in the world is a 
Triad Phase Cannon!?&quot;

&quot;BIG LASER.&quot; Fujin smiled wickedly.

&quot;No.&quot; Quistis scowled, lowering her chair back to the deck. &quot;Don&#146;t even 
think about it.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin mouthed innocently.

&quot;Don&#146;t give me that, I saw the twinkle in your eye. Just leave them 
alone until we run tests.&quot;

&quot;Quisty.&quot; Ellone called out, noticing a blinking light on one of the 
consoles.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I think we have a call.&quot;

&quot;Oh, well answer it.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; Ellone nodded, then fumbled around for a second.

&quot;Hello?&quot; Cid&#146;s voice echoed.

&quot;Sir?&quot; Quistis called out.

&quot;Ah there you are; we&#146;ve been trying to hail you for the last twenty 
minutes.&quot;

&quot;Sorry sir, we haven&#146;t been up long.&quot;

&quot;Understandable. Permission to come aboard, we&#146;ve brought some reporters 
from the local media, they want a tour.&quot;

&quot;MEDIA...&quot; Fujin scowled.

&quot;Tour...&quot; Quistis groaned. &quot;Um... wouldn&#146;t it be better to do that once 
I actually know my way around?&quot;

&quot;Well yes, but considering the fiasco yesterday, Laguna and I thought it 
best to start work on public relations.&quot;

&quot;I understand...&quot; She relented. &quot;Permission granted.&quot; She sighed typed 
in command. &quot;Bay thirteen is open, we&#146;ll meet you there.&quot;

&quot;Oh and Xu brought you&#146;re Seed Uniforms, we want to make a good 
impression.&quot;

*****************

Upon arriving at the hanger they found Xu waiting outside the ship with 
their uniforms.

&quot;Here, you guys go clean up and get dressed.&quot; She said hurriedly then 
looked at Ellone questioningly.

&quot;You seem to be in a good mood?&quot;

&quot;I love it here, I haven&#146;t had this much fun in months.&quot; Ellone said on 
the edge of a teeter.

&quot;Really, that&#146;s kind of sad.&quot;

&quot;Why do you say that?&quot;

&quot;Never mind.&quot;

&quot;Oh, okay then.&quot; Ellone shrugged then looked at the uniform Xu had given 
her. &quot;Cool, it&#146;s like I&#146;m in the club now!&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s just for show...&quot;

&quot;Xu...&quot; Quistis said blandly.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;We have to go change.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah, sorry. Um, Cid&#146;s keeping the media hounds occupied... we&#146;ll be 
waiting for you.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Quistis nodded. &quot;We&#146;ll be right back.&quot;

 Hurrying to the nearest restroom, the trio changed clothes and hurried 
back. Putting on their best faces, Ellone and Quistis smiled broadly as 
Cid and Laguna emerged with the small crowd of reporters and cameramen. 
Fujin however was having a quiet fit. Normally, she wore her war god 
uniform at formal functions. However, Xu, either by design or accident 
had given her one of the standard SEED uniforms, which to her chagrin 
came with a skirt.

&quot;Quit snarling.&quot; Quistis whispered at her.

&quot;FEEL STUPID.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re blowing it out of proportion, just grin and bear it.&quot;

&quot;SKIRT TOO TIGHT.&quot;

&quot;What do you want me to do?&quot;

&quot;MAKE BETTER...&quot; Fujin pouted under her breath.

Quistis snickered and shook her head, trying not to laugh.

&quot;Professor Trepe!&quot; Various reporters blurted in unison as they jockeyed 
for her attention.

&quot;Whoa...&quot; Quistis balked as they nearly bowled her over.

&quot;Oh I should remind you that you&#146;re pretty famous. You&#146;re the poster 
girl for the Garden Project.&quot; Xu whispered in her ear.

&quot;I&#146;m the what? Since when?&quot; Quistis blurted, glaring at her.

&quot;We&#146;ll for years now actually...&quot; Xu giggled.

&quot;I see what Ayane was talking about now... You and I are going to talk 
later...&quot; Quistis hissed.

&quot;Smile.&quot; Xu cheered her as the first reporter thrust a microphone in her 
face.

&quot;Professor!&quot; The young man shouted eagerly.

&quot;Yes, okay I hear you calm down, call me Quistis, or Mrs. Trepe.&quot;

&quot;When did you find out you were to be in charge of Esthar Garden?&quot;

&quot;Yesterday.&quot;

&quot;What makes you qualified? We&#146;ve heard you&#146;ve not had formal training in 
running a facility such as this and that you&#146;ve had your teaching 
license revoked.&quot;

&quot;First off, considering the fact that this Garden is the first of its 
kind it&#146;s safe to assume that it&#146;d be a new experience for anyone. And 
as for my license, my teaching records are open to the public if you 
have in inquiries. Next Question.&quot; Quistis countered snappily.

&quot;Is it true that this is a battle station and militant training ground?&quot;

&quot;First and foremost all gardens are technical academies. As for the 
so-called militant&#146;s... The SEED program has been acknowledged and 
accepted by all leading governments and their respective agencies. 
Next.&quot;

&quot;Is it true you are having an affair with President Loire?&quot; A young 
woman blurted.

&quot;What?&quot; Laguna gurgled in shock.

&quot;I&#146;m not even going to dignify that with a response...&quot; Quistis answered 
with an icy glare.

&quot;So that&#146;s not a denial?&quot; The girl smiled slyly.

Fujin cringed and rubbed her forehead. This was going to be a long day.

************************

When all was said and done Quistis stormed into her office, slipped off 
her boots and kicked back in her chair as her companions quietly sat 
down.

&quot;Well that went good.&quot; Cid smiled.

&quot;Ugh I hate doing press conferences...&quot; Quistis complained, her voice 
weary and annoyed.

&quot;You handled it like a pro.&quot; Xu giggled.

&quot;I can&#146;t believe they thought we&#146;re having an affair.&quot; Laguna fretted.

&quot;You should be used to it.&quot; Cid smirked.

&quot;You guys were awesome.&quot; Zell shouted, rushing into the office. &quot;I 
watched the whole thing aboard the ship. Quistis, you rocked! I loved 
how you handled the question about Fujin.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Zell...&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t mention it but oh man, Fuster, you really need to lighten up, you 
nearly bite that woman&#146;s head off.&quot;

&quot;Fuster?&quot; Ellone smiled merrily.

&quot;FUJIN, FUJIN!&quot; Fujin snapped in annoyance.

&quot;We&#146;ll at least they seemed to like the notion of her being Field 
leader.&quot; Cid pointed out.

&quot;Of course.&quot; Laguna smiled. &quot;She&#146;s got the right personality.&quot;

&quot;WHAT MEAN!?&quot; Fujin barked.

&quot;Um... So... what now?&quot; He continued sheepishly, hoping to change the 
subject.

&quot;Now Quistis gets to pick the rest of her staff.&quot; Cid said evenly.

&quot;Hah, have fun.&quot; Laguna chucked.

&quot;Oh yeah, about that...&quot; Zell mumbled awkwardly causing everyone to look 
at him.

&quot;Zell?&quot; Quistis frowned worriedly.

&quot;Well...&quot; He continued. &quot;It&#146;s like this... Nikki wants to move...&quot;

&quot;Move?&quot; Cid repeated curiously. &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

&quot;No, not at all... well kinda...&quot;

&quot;Explain.&quot; Quistis prodded carefully.

&quot;We&#146;ll she&#146;s kinda wanting a change of scenery, and to be honest I do 
too.&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Cid smirked, feigning insult.

&quot;Zell, do you mean to say you want to defect?&quot; Quistis chuckled causing 
him to wince.

&quot;Ew...don&#146;t say it like that, I feel bad enough as is...Anyway, I was 
wondering if, ya know, you have any positions open?&quot;

&quot;Hmm.&quot; Quistis mumbled, leaning back in her chair in thought. &quot;Well... 
I&#146;ll need an assistant, someone like Xu... to act as principle over the 
students. Someone smart.&quot;

&quot;Oh hey...!&quot; Zell blurted nervously. &quot;No offense or nothing Miss Trepe 
but I was hoping for something a little tamer, perhaps coach...nah... 
that sounds boring.&quot; He mused then brightened. &quot;Oh how about this.&quot; He 
grinned proudly, spreading his arms as if the idea were in lights. 
&quot;Athletics Coordinator.&quot;

&quot;Honestly, I was thinking about Nicole, Zell...&quot; Quistis grinned 
sheepishly.

&quot;Oh...Oh!&quot; Zell blinked, blushing. &quot;Um, sure, sure... I&#146;m uh...well I 
think she&#146;d love it...being principle and all...&quot; He mumbled absently.

Fujin rolled her gaze at Quistis who smiled apologetically.

&quot;Nicole is a good choice.&quot; Cid nodded approvingly.

&quot;But you&#146;re right.&quot; Quistis continued. &quot;I will need an ahem... Athletics 
Coordinator.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Zell asked, his tone unsure and meek.

&quot;Yes Zell.&quot; Quistis smiled. &quot;I&#146;m positive.&quot;

&quot;Oh cool! I&#146;m the man then!&quot; He blurted, thumping his chest. &quot;Just watch 
me work; I&#146;ll whip the little punks into shape.&quot;

&quot;OGRE.&quot; Fujin groaned, causing Ellone to giggle quietly.

&quot;So do you think Nicole will accept the offer?&quot; Quistis asked after he&#146;d 
settled.

&quot;Huh? Who, oh Nikki, oh yeah without a doubt! I can&#146;t wait to tell her. 
That is; unless you want to ask her yourself.&quot;

&quot;No, that&#146;s okay, you tell her.&quot; Quistis smiled then sighed. &quot;Squall&#146;s 
not going to like this...&quot;

&quot;He&#146;ll be fine.&quot; Laguna muttered under his breath. &quot;The boy is a 
stone...&quot;

Cid glanced at him then grinned to Quistis.

&quot;Well, looks like you&#146;re off to a good start.&quot;

&quot;Hardly, I still need to hire teaching staff...&quot;

&quot;Taken care of.&quot; Xu said with obvious pride as she stepped forward.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Quistis said, surprised.

&quot;Yes, I hand picked everyone on this list.&quot; Xu continued, producing a 
small folder from her jacket. &quot;I&#146;ve organized them by the specialties 
and availability. I also added specific recommendations on assignments 
and such to help out.&quot;

&quot;Why thank you Heart.&quot; Quistis marveled.

&quot;No problem.&quot;

&quot;Oh no!&quot; Zell blurted, startling everyone and causing Ellone to jump.

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis frowned, not appreciating the outburst.

&quot;The Ragnarok... I&#146;ll loose my baby...&quot;

&quot;IDIOT.&quot; Fujin said briskly then slapped him in the back of the head.

&quot;Hey it&#146;s not funny, what am I going to do. Whoa! Sir can I buy her!?&quot; 
He blurted, grabbing Cid by the shoulders excitedly.

&quot;Buy her? Who the Ragnarok?&quot;

&quot;You do realize those things run over a 23 million a piece don&#146;t you.&quot; 
Xu muttered absently.

&quot;Oh man...&quot;

&quot;Zell, dear boy.&quot; Cid laughed. &quot;Considering all the modifications you&#146;ve 
added. I don&#146;t think anyone else could work on it. Therefore, I think 
it&#146;d be best if I donated it to Esthar Garden.&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot; Zell hooted, jumping up and down while hugging the older man 
tightly. Quistis looked slightly troubled.

&quot;Squall&#146;s defiantly not going to like that.&quot; She said thoughtfully. 
&quot;I&#146;ll trade you a couple of the newer models in exchange. Two should 
cover it considering the Ragnarok is twice as large.&quot; Quistis offered 
Cid graciously.

&quot;Sounds like a deal.&quot; Cid smiled.

&quot;Not here a day and you&#146;re already pawning off stuff...&quot; Laguna scowled 
good-naturedly.

&quot;Well that&#146;s about it then.&quot; Cid sighed. &quot;Now all we have to do is let 
the local inspectors do their job and we can start enrollment. Until 
then, I&#146;m going to kick back and let you kids do the work for a change.&quot;

&quot;You have to love the mans enthusiasm.&quot; Xu laughed, was they started 
back towards the hanger.

&quot;Ellone, how was your evening, any problems?&quot; Laguna asked as they 
walked.

&quot;Not at all, though I still need to pick a place.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s going to be hard not having you around anymore.&quot;

&quot;Oh stop that, we&#146;re headquartered just outside of town. I can come see 
you whenever I want.&quot;

&quot;Just make sure you do.&quot;

&quot;I promise.&quot; She giggled, taking his hand.

&quot;Ha I bet you&#146;re glad we&#146;re moving in eh? Ain&#146;t it cool.&quot; Zell said 
gleefully, throwing an arm around Fujin&#146;s shoulder. Like a snake, she 
slithered out of range and regarded him gravely.

&quot;CLOWN.&quot;

&quot;You love me.&quot; He winked then looked at Quistis knowingly. &quot;She loves 
me.&quot;

&quot;UGH...&quot; Fujin groaned and quickened her pace.

&quot;Hyne I don&#146;t know if I can take having you two in my face all the 
time.&quot; Quistis said with joking sincerity.

&quot;Please...&quot; Zell snorted. &quot;You&#146;d be bored here without me and you know 
it. Man o man, wait till I tell the guys, they&#146;re gonna freak.&quot;

********************

In the days and weeks that followed, inspections were made and final 
preparations finalized. Now, just days away from Esthar Garden&#146;s or 
simply Eden&#146;s as it was now being called, grand opening, hearts and 
minds were troubled.

&quot;I can&#146;t believe this.&quot; Squall said quietly, looking down from the 
railing overlooking Balamb&#146;s main hall. Rinoa stood next to him, resting 
her head against his shoulder as far below, movers carried boxes and 
furniture from the cargo elevators.

&quot;I know... it seems like everyone&#146;s leaving, were going to be by 
ourselves.&quot; She sighed sadly.

&quot;Even Selphie and Irvine...&quot; Squall mumbled.

&quot;She wants raise her child in Trabia so she can be closer to her 
friends.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...I know...&quot;

&quot;Squall?&quot; Rinoa said softly, looking at him in surprise. &quot;You&#146;re really 
upset about of this aren&#146;t you?&quot;

Squall turned to look at her sourly.

&quot;What I can&#146;t have feelings? Of course I&#146;m upset...&quot;

&quot;I...I sorry, just assumed.&quot;

&quot;You should know better than that.&quot; Squall groused irritably. &quot;Of course 
I&#146;m going to miss them...all of them&quot;

&quot;Aw I know but it&#146;s time to move on. Selphie pretty much has family in 
Trabia; folks she&#146;s known most of her life. We all knew she planned on 
returning someday.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you&#146;re right...&quot;

&quot;Quistis was looking for you earlier; she wanted to give you something 
before they finished moving.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot;

&quot;Did you see her?&quot;

&quot;Not yet...&quot;

&quot;Have you even talked to any of them? Zell? Nicole? Irvine?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;You better not let them leave without saying goodbye!&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m not good at goodbyes...&quot;

&quot;Tough! If you don&#146;t say bye they&#146;ll think you don&#146;t care.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...I know.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t see why it&#146;d be so hard. I mean, yes it sucks that they&#146;re 
leaving but...&quot; She paused then looked at him intently. &quot;You&#146;re not 
worried that you&#146;d start crying or something are you?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Squall blurted, eyeing her as if she&#146;d gone mad.

&quot;Ooh look I must have struck a nerve.&quot; She teased playfully.

&quot;Grow up.&quot; He grinned faintly, rolling his eyes. Smiling she hugged his 
arm comfortably. A long moment of silence past then, as they stood 
silent vigil, finally, her voice devoid of her feigned levity, Rinoa 
sniffed quietly.

&quot;I&#146;m going to miss them too...&quot;

********************

&quot;Fujin get the lead out!&quot; Selphie barked, sitting atop several boxes 
cradling baby Edea.

&quot;COMING, COMING!&quot; Fujin shouted angrily as she came around the corner 
hauling a large recliner.

&quot;Hyne you&#146;re slow.&quot;

&quot;KISS ASS.&quot; Fujin grunted, setting the chair down heavily.

&quot;Be nice.&quot; Quistis giggled, carrying a lamp. &quot;I told you to get Irvine 
to help you.

&quot;Oh she&#146;s so butch.&quot; Selphie teetered mischievously.

&quot;AM NOT.&quot; Fujin countered defensively.

Quistis exploded into laughter then stepped between the two.

&quot;You two can flirt later; I want to get this done.&quot;

&quot;Flirt, with her? Ewww!&quot; Selphie sputtered.

&quot;DISGUSTING...&quot; Fujin blanched looking at Selphie as if she were a 
rotten fish.

&quot;Someone say flirt?&quot; Irvine said hopefully as he exited the Ragnarok. 
&quot;Can I watch?&quot;

&quot;Shut up...&quot; The trio of women snapped.

&quot;Whoa dude...&quot; Zell paused, following just behind him. &quot;What&#146;d you do?&quot; 
He asked quietly, noting the icy glares from the three.

The loud clattering of talons and a yelp signaled Nicole&#146;s arrival as 
she barreled into the hanger being all but dragged onward by a leashed 
Ica.

The psuedo dragon was now larger than Angelo and was obviously eager to 
be out and about.

&quot;MONSTER.&quot; Fujin blurted, moving well clear of the overzealous reptile.

&quot;Oh eww Quisty! Are you going to let her bring that thing aboard Eden!?&quot; 
Selphie squeaked and giggled as it licked her feet with its monstrously 
long, forked tongue.

&quot;Ew gross...&quot; Zell gurgled.

&quot;Yeah, her feet are pretty nasty...&quot; Irvine nodded in grim agreement.

&quot;I heard that you bastard!&quot; Selphie shouted, throwing odd bits of 
luggage at him.

&quot;Hey! Hey! Whoa watch the stuff!&quot; Zell blurted.

 One of the projectiles was a stuffed well ratty looking stuffed Mog, 
which Fujin quickly intercepted.

Grinning widely she looked it over; obviously well loved it wore a 
miners hat and overalls.

&quot;CUTE.&quot; She said approvingly then paused upon noticing everyone looking 
at her. A brief silence ensued as she blushed various shades of red.

&quot;HERE...&quot; She grumbled in embarrassment as she passed it to Nicole.

&quot;That&#146;s not mine, it&#146;s Zell&#146;s&quot; Nicole responded casually.

&quot;Poody!&quot; Zell yelped, snatching the Mog from Fujin&#146;s hands. &quot;Get your 
grimy mitts of him.&quot;

&quot;Grimy mitts...?&quot; Quistis said under her breath as if it tasted bad.

Fujin blinked in confusion then shook her head.

&quot;Come on, come on. We&#146;re loosing sunlight.&quot; Nicole announced, clapping 
her hands.

&quot;Oh would you look at her.&quot; Selphie giggled. &quot;She gets some authority 
and she&#146;s already bossing folks around.&quot;

&quot;You guys are the ones who offered to help so I don&#146;t want to hear it.&quot; 
Nicole grinned.

&quot;Principle Delricci.&quot; Irvine smiled. &quot;Sounds so official don&#146;t it.&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#146;t it&quot; Quistis corrected him.

&quot;Actually guys.&quot; Xu announced, walking towards them. &quot;I just talked to 
the movers, they&#146;re finished. Selphie, they&#146;ll meet you in Trabia in a 
few hours.&quot;

&quot;Cool!&quot; Selphie beamed happily.

Turning to Quistis, Xu regarded her thoughtfully.

&quot;Are you sure you got everything?&quot;

&quot;Yes, we moved the rest of it last evening.&quot;

&quot;Well guys I guess that&#146;s it then.&quot; Irvine said quietly.

&quot;Will I see you two on opening day?&quot; Quistis asked.

&quot;Of course!&quot; Selphie answered quickly.

&quot;Anyone seen Squall or Rinoa.&quot; Zell asked curiously.

&quot;Nope.&quot; Xu shrugged.

&quot;Damn, I was hoping they&#146;d see us off...&quot; Quistis sighed sadly.

&quot;Yeah well, I think Squall is taking it kind of hard...&quot; Selphie said 
softly.

&quot;Poor guy.&quot; Zell sniffed.

&quot;HUMPF.&quot; Fujin snorted, breaking the moment before heading into the 
Ragnarok.

&quot;Don&#146;t mind her; she&#146;s mad about the mog.&quot; Quistis whispered. A quiet 
chuckle echoed amid the group briefly before dying down.

&quot;I&#146;m going to miss you guys.&quot; Irvine sighed.

&quot;We&#146;ll see you again big guy.&quot; Zell grinned punching him in the arm.

  For a moment he stood straight faced, then twitched weirdly before 
abruptly bursting into sobs and flinging himself at the taller man.

&quot;What in the world?&quot; Irvine flinched as Zell locked his arms around him.

Hearing the commotion, Fujin paused and looked back at the deck.

&quot;Oh jeeze...&quot; Selphie sniffed.

&quot;Damn, get a hold of yourself...&quot; Xu winced as Zell promptly grabbed 
Selphie next who tried feebly to get away.

&quot;NO PRIDE...&quot; Fujin sighed, making her way back to Quistis&#146; side.

&quot;Is everything okay?&quot; Rinoa asked, announcing her and Squall&#146;s presence.

&quot;Oh hey there you two are!&quot; Quistis smiled, grabbing a large case.

&quot;Sorry we&#146;re late.&quot; Rinoa apologized as Squall looked curiously as 
Nicole and Xu tried to pry Zell of Irvine and Selphie.

&quot;DON&#146;T ASK.&quot; Fujin said quietly.

&quot;Where is Ellone?&quot; Squall asked.

&quot;Getting the rest of her things I&#146;d assume.&quot; Quistis explained. &quot;That 
and she wanted to spend the day with Laguna.&quot;

&quot;Ah.&quot; He nodded then looked curiously as Quistis held up the nearly 
five-foot long case.

&quot;We bought you guys something.&quot;

&quot;Oh that&#146;s so sweet.&quot; Rinoa awed.

&quot;CHECK OUT.&quot; Fujin prodded eagerly.

&quot;Um okay.&quot; Squall nodded, sitting down on a nearby bench to better 
handle the object. Popping the latches, he opened the case and marveled. 
Inside were two weapons a Gunblade and Disk launcher similar to the one 
Rinoa wielded. Both weapons were exquisitely crafted as to be works of 
fine art, lined with gold and crafted from highest quality metals. The 
weapons looked more for display than use.

&quot;Wow...&quot; Squall blinked.

&quot;I wanted to get you something different honestly. But Fujin insisted we 
give you something you could actually use.&quot;

&quot;They&#146;re functional?&quot; Squall marveled, carefully picking up the blade.

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot; Fujin answered firmly.

&quot;She knows this guy in Esthar who&#146;s has connections.&quot; Quistis explained. 
&quot;He hooked us up with some master weapon smiths.&quot;

&quot;Aegis?&quot; Squall asked absently. Fujin nodded. &quot;I remember him, he&#146;s a 
good man.&quot; He said quietly, testing the blade&#146;s balance. Rinoa too tried 
out her gift and attached it to her forearm.

&quot;Oh I like this...&quot; She said with a wicked smile. &quot;I don&#146;t see any 
blades for it though?&quot;

&quot;GOOD PART!&quot; Fujin grinned.

&quot;Oh that&#146;s the good part, Fujin suggested it. It draws energy from you 
to form the disks. That way you don&#146;t have to reload. All you have to do 
is press the trigger.&quot;

&quot;Cool.&quot; Rinoa giggled, aiming the weapon into the air.

&quot;Squall the sword is made of um...Fu, what was it?&quot; Quistis asked.

&quot;MULTI COMPOSITE GRAVJIIUM.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Rinoa giggled.

&quot;We don&#146;t know what it is either, but it&#146;s said to be nearly 
indestructible and will not loose its edge. Fu bought a Chakram made of 
the stuff and swears by it.&quot;

&quot;Um wow, thanks.&quot; Squall smiled, settling the blade back into the case 
along with Rinoa&#146;s launcher.

&quot;This must have cost a fortune...&quot; Rinoa frowned.

&quot;Please.&quot; Quistis rolled her eyes and waved it aside.

A loud snort announced Zell&#146;s presence.

&quot;Feeling better?&quot; Quistis asked with an amused smirk.

&quot;Yeah...I guess.&quot;

&quot;Gross my shirt is soaked...&quot; Selphie complained quietly.

&quot;Boss man, there you are.&quot; Irvine laughed, clapping Squall on the 
shoulder.

&quot;I came to see you guys off.&quot; Squall said evenly. &quot;You&#146;ll be missed, all 
of you...&quot;

&quot;Ah hell that&#146;s right nice of you.&quot; Irvine smiled, shaking his hand 
briskly.

&quot;Squally!&quot; Selphie whined. Passing Edea to Irvine she rushed forward and 
threw hugged her friend tightly. &quot;I&#146;m going to miss you.&quot;

&quot;Oh come on, we&#146;ll see each other at the grand opening.&quot; Quistis sniffed 
in spite of herself.

&quot;She&#146;s right.&quot; Squall smiled. &quot;Now you guys get out of here before you 
make me make a fool of myself.&quot; Hugs and handshakes passed between the 
old friends and quietly one by one they went their separate ways.

 Slowly the Ragnarok&#146;s engines flamed to life and the ship lifted off 
and within moments left its old home behind.

****************************

Opening day, and judging by the hordes of spectators and applicants the 
Esthar Garden could be considered a success. Floating calmly in a 
specially built harbor Eden easily connected with various structures and 
service roads that served to supplement its facilities. Some of the 
buildings included a traditional college campus as well as a monstrous 
service tower for making repairs. Near the sprawling campus compound was 
a sea of rolling fields that served to house a temporary fair. A 
plethora of carnival rides clanged nosily while the scent of cotton 
candy and popcorn hung in the air.

Tour guides driving small open vans ferried onlookers as well as 
possible students to and fro. Amid the hustle and bustle Fujin was ill 
at ease. Taking a break from the press conferences and interviews, 
Quistis had decided they take advantage of the nearby fair.

&quot;SMELLS.&quot; Fujin complained irritably.

&quot;It&#146;s supposed to. Trust me, next time you smell popcorn you&#146;ll be 
reminded of this day.&quot; Quistis said happily, dragging her along by the 
hand.

&quot;HATE POPCORN.&quot;

&quot;Fine cotton candy then.&quot;

&quot;GROSS.&quot;

&quot;Candy apples.&quot;

&quot;ANNOYING.&quot;

&quot;Fine sweet rolls then, I know you like them you only ate like six 
earlier.&quot;

&quot;THEY GOOD.&quot;

&quot;Hyne...&quot; Quistis groaned then stopped abruptly. &quot;Oh!&quot; She squealed 
gleefully causing Fujin to worry. &quot;Oh, oh, please oh please can we try 
it!&quot; Quistis pleaded, going so far to get on her knees.

 Fujin flushed in embarrassment and looked around.

&quot;WHAT, TRY WHAT?&quot; She blurted, hauling her back to her feet.

 The foul smell of animal waste and a loud &quot;Wark!&quot; Like noise answered 
her question.

&quot;NEGATIVE!&quot; She said sharply. Noticing the sign that read:

CHOCOBO RIDE.

5.00 Per Adult

&quot;Please, oh please.&quot; Quistis whined, rushing towards a fence where a 
trio of the large birds squawked and jostled each other noisily.

&quot;CAN&#146;T.&quot; Fujin shrugged, not going anywhere near them.

&quot;What, why not?&quot; Quistis scowled, stamping her foot.

&quot;TOO SHORT.&quot; Fujin smiled, pointing to a height sign.

&quot;That&#146;s not even for here. Besides, you&#146;re slouching, now stop that and 
come here!&quot; Quistis ordered.

Slowly, Fujin made her way forward. The birds, tall and imposing looked 
down at her with their odd somewhat crossed gaze.

&quot;UGH.&quot; She grimaced as one squawked in her face, its breath reeking of 
earth and garbage.

&quot;NO...&quot; She grunted then turned to leave.

&quot;Oh come on.&quot; Quistis giggled, taking her by the hand.

&quot;They&#146;re cute, see.&quot; She pointed out, scratching behind one of the 
bird&#146;s head. &quot;Pet one.&quot;

&quot;NO.&quot;

&quot;They won&#146;t bite.&quot;

&quot;STINK.&quot;

&quot;They do not. Well...okay maybe a little, but they&#146;re animals what can 
they do, come on, do it for me, please.&quot;

&quot;PEOPLE RIDE?&quot;

&quot;All the time, look, even Squall&#146;s ridden one before.&quot;

&quot;FUNNY.&quot;

&quot;Yes it was, now surely if he&#146;d get on one so can you. Besides, they&#146;re 
great for cross-country travel over hard terrain. It&#146;d be good for you 
to learn to ride one.&quot; Unfazed and unimpressed, Fujin folded her arms in 
defiance.

Ruffling its feathers and annoyed at being ignored, the chocobo nearest 
her abruptly began squawking loudly while hopping up and down before 
pecking her atop the head.

 Nearly jumping out of her boots Fujin made a whining noise and scurried 
behind Quistis while holding her scalp.

&quot;TRIED EAT ME!&quot; She shouted, kicking dirt at the offending creature. 
Thinking it some sort of game, the bird responded by turning and 
returning the gesture, its talons kicking up a cloud of dirt and mud.

&quot;Ack! Hell!&quot; Quistis shouted, running for cover. &quot;See what you started.&quot;

&quot;BAH!&quot; Fujin growled, grabbing a clod of grass to hurl.

&quot;Quit antagonizing it!&quot; Quistis shouted, grabbing her arm.

&quot;IT STARTED.&quot; Fujin sneered gruffly, eying the bird with contempt.

 Caught up in its game the chocobo hopped up and down and flapped 
merrily.

&quot;What are you two doing to me birds!&quot; A large slovenly man bellowed, 
waddling out of a nearby trailer.

&quot;Whoa...&quot; Quistis balked.

&quot;BIG...&quot; Fujin agreed. The man was only six foot tall but what was 
startling was that he was also about six feet wide. Watching them 
suspiciously the man went to the agitated chocobo and quieted it down.

&quot;Sorry, it startled us.&quot; Quistis apologized. &quot;Um we were hoping to ride 
one.&quot;

&quot;All right by me so long as you pay first.&quot; The man shrugged, watching 
Fujin intently.

&quot;Sure thing.&quot; Quistis grinned, paying the man. Nodding in approval the 
man&#146;s demeanor changed from cautious to cheerful.

&quot;Well then little ladies, step this way.&quot; He smiled, opening the fence.

Immediately several Chocobo&#146;s waddled up to greet them.

 Fujin pulled continuously on Quistis&#146; sleeve, wanting nothing more than 
to be away from the ornery birds. The dust kicking chocobo walked behind 
Fujin and promptly butted her in the back with its head.

&quot;GAH!&quot; Fujin shrieked stumbling forward before spinning around to face 
her assailant. Mimicking her, the bird squawked, spun around then 
squawked again.

&quot;Well look at there, Gristle likes you.&quot; The man hooted.

&quot;Aw how cute Fu, Gristle likes you.&quot; Quistis smiled.

&quot;LUCKY ME...&quot;

 Moments later and after a brief lesson Fujin soon found herself 
standing at Gristle&#146;s side eyeing the saddle suspiciously.

&quot;Come on!&quot; Quistis cheered, already running her bird around.

&quot;A MOMENT.&quot; Fujin called. Tentatively she raised a foot to put in the 
stirrup only to have Gristle step away.

&quot;STILL!&quot; Fujin barked, to no avail, in fact the bird squawked and 
flapped a few times before settling back down.

&quot;Fu come on.&quot; Quistis waved, easing her bird up next to them.

Giving in, Fujin took a breath and all but flung herself atop the 
massive bird. Her efforts were rewarded with a mouthful of feathers 
before pulling herself upright.

&quot;There you go.&quot; Quistis smiled.

 Shifting in the saddle, Fujin got comfortable then gripped the reigns.

&quot;GO.&quot; She muttered forcefully.

&quot;Give him a little kick, not to hard though.&quot; Quistis offered. Fujin did 
as she was told and the bird waddled forward.

&quot;DID IT.&quot; Fujin grinned.

&quot;There ya go.&quot; Quistis giggled. Starting to enjoy herself Fujin 
quickened the pace and soon had the chocobo racing all over the place. 
Taking advantage of distraction, Quistis quietly slipped a camera from 
her pocket and started taking pictures. Seeing Fujin turn to head back, 
she quietly slipped the camera back in her pocket and smiled.

&quot;See now, that&#146;s not so bad is it?&quot;

&quot;NOT REALLY.&quot; Fujin admitted with a hearty grin.

&quot;Miss Trepe!&quot; A voice called from beyond the fence.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Quistis frown in confusion, looking around.

&quot;THERE.&quot; Fujin pointed. Casually, the two women rode to where the voice 
came from and looked around. To there surprise a familiar face greeted 
them.

&quot;ROYCE?&quot; Fujin gaped.

&quot;Um hi Fujin.&quot; The young man waved awkwardly. He&#146;d changed much since 
last they&#146;d seen him. Slightly broader, he had obviously filled out in 
the intervening years and was no longer the somewhat gangly youth.

&quot;Royce, my word I hardly recognize you.&quot; Quistis smiled.

&quot;Hi Miss Trepe.&quot; He smiled. &quot;Glad to see you haven&#146;t changed.&quot;

&quot;Me, nah, I&#146;m eternal.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s what I hear.&quot; He laughed.

&quot;Royce... Hyne, how have you been?&quot;

&quot;Okay... though it took some time...&quot;

&quot;I understand, trust me. Loosing someone is always difficult.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you&#146;re right. About that though...&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;I wanted to apologize... for taking it out on you...it wasn&#146;t your 
fault.&quot;

&quot;No need to apologize, we were all hurting.&quot;

&quot;I guess so.&quot; He sighed then shoved his hands in his pockets.

&quot;So what can I do for you Royce? I have a feeling this isn&#146;t a 
coincidental meeting.&quot; Quistis asked, sorely wishing to change the 
subject.

&quot;Well honestly, I came to talk to you about something. When I heard 
you&#146;d be in charge of the new Garden it got me thinking... I was 
wrong...&quot;

&quot;Oh, about?&quot;

&quot;About leaving, quitting...Aeka wouldn&#146;t have wanted that.&quot;

&quot;So what are you saying?&quot; Quistis asked her tone firm.

&quot;I want to finish my training; I owe it to her... and myself.&quot;

Fujin frowned sadly at the memories of her slain friend. Quistis sighed 
heavily in thought then looked intently at him.

&quot;Okay...&quot; She finally agreed after a long pause. &quot;Go register...&quot;

&quot;Yes Ma&#146;am...&quot;

&quot;And Royce.&quot;

&quot;Yes Ma&#146;am?&quot;

&quot;Welcome back...&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; He nodded quietly then disappeared into the crowd.

Fujin watched Quistis solemnly for a moment then eased her mount up 
beside her.

&quot;YOU OKAY?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I was just thinking about Aeka.&quot;

&quot;ME TOO...&quot;

&quot;She should be here... They all should...&quot;

**************************

Some time later...

Evening, and all was quiet and it seemed as though whole world were at 
peace. Somewhere ancient, deep within in a nameless mountain forest a 
campfire crackled amid the sound of laughter. Raijin sat gesturing 
wildly, his large arms waving about as he recounted a story. Jaya at his 
side listened intently, an amused smile on her lips while her brother; 
Miguel laughed his deep bellowing laugh. Resting back against a fallen 
log, Seifer shook his head laughingly at the memory. Curled against him 
and listening to the tale, Celest casually ran fingers across his chest 
as a smile parted her lips.

Miles away Balamb Garden drifted slowly in the moonlight as the ocean 
sparked like below. On the bridge, Nida stood quietly at the controls, 
thoughts calm as relaxing music echoed softly. Turning his head, he 
smiled at Xu who sat nearby, her feet propped up lazily as she read a 
dusty novel of intrigue. Glancing up from behind her reading glasses she 
gave a soft smile. Elsewhere in Balamb a couple strolled lightly through 
the park, the moonlight bathing them in a blue glow. Rinoa paused as 
Angelo trotted forward to lean against her leg. Fondly she knelt to 
caress her aging pet. Squall grinned as the dog panted gratefully, so 
easily pleased. Looking up he peered into the heavens and wondered.

An old building nearly lost to time and decay. Wind whistled through 
crumbling walls and wooden beams creaked. But signs of new life were 
present.  The smell of sawdust and old leather hung in the evening air 
amid sawhorses and carpentry tools. The sole occupant of the derelict 
orphanage was protected. In one area life indeed began anew, sheltered 
by newly repaired walls and a freshly a added roof. An old man, tired 
but strong, approaching the later years of his life. Cid sat lost in 
thought, staring quietly at a picture of his late wife. Although the 
surrounding boxes where full of memory and nostalgia, this one picture 
was the most valued of all.

Nestled in a snowy valley far away stood Trabia Garden, a symbol of 
rebirth and perseverance. Inside, a new life slept bearing the name of 
the past. Young Edea rested peacefully in her mother&#146;s arms. Selphie 
stroked her hair softly from her seat on the couch as Irvine sat on the 
floor trying to put together a baby crib, though at the moment it more 
resembled a piece of abstract art. Smiling sarcastically, Selphie held 
up an untouched instruction manual, waving it before his eyes. Relenting 
he took the manual and started over.

The sea, seemingly endless, full of lost dreams and forgotten voices, 
one voice, a young girl snatched away from the world far too early. 
Brought here by those who loved her, as a final resting place so that 
she could finally be one with the world she so cherished.

Drifting in the void of space, a tomb of science and sorcery and its 
lone occupant, the shell of a woman with a tragic past and trapped 
within; a creature of darkness. Bound together and sealed away through 
loss and sacrifice, the evil was banished. Over the passing centuries it 
and the woman who both will be forgotten until the day darkness is 
loosed once more.

The city of Esthar glittered magically in the night and at its heart, 
the presidential estate. Within its gilded halls sat Laguna quietly 
having dinner with his closest friends and their families. Sadness 
filled his heart briefly as he watched Ward and Kiro&#146;s families chatter 
amongst themselves while what remained of his own family drifted further 
and further away. A wife in the grave and a son he barely knew. His last 
joy, Ellone, his daughter was finally making her own path. He did not 
fret long though. Content with the knowledge that Ellone, his heart and 
joy would prosper.

Not far away was the Garden of Eden as it was known by some, or more 
officially Esthar Garden. New faces filled its halls, faculty and 
students alike and with them came new friendships, budding from the 
common awe of being in a new place. In one of the rooms, putting away 
his things Royce regarded his snoring roommate sourly. Trying his best 
to ignore it, he continued unpacking, only to pause as he came across an 
old folder.

Opening it he saw photos of old classmates. Aeka, someone he loved 
though she never knew it. Archibald, another lost soul, betrayed and 
left behind and Luccian, who&#146;s dark haunting eyes, peered up from the 
photo. Only now did Royce see the inherent sadness behind the hateful 
gaze. Closing the folder he began to set it aside when a small 
membership card fell out. Picking it up, he gazed quietly at it a moment 
then smiled.

Down the hall Ayane preened proudly in her new school uniform. With 
Naomi being assigned as a technical consultant for the new Garden, it 
was easy enough for her to decide to take some courses and even try out 
for the SEED program. Naomi meanwhile, sat atop the bed watching her 
with a lewd expression. So many new faces, so much potential she 
realized, and knew that life was about to become far more interesting.

Sitting cross-legged on the couch in her new apartment, Nicole dug 
feverishly through several notebooks and journals. Getting a head start 
on her duties as principle meant long hours of paperwork lay ahead of 
her. Rubbing her temples wearily she gazed down at Ica who snoozed 
lazily at her feet. She envied the little dragon sometimes; it hadn&#146;t a 
care in the world. Looking up, she could hear Zell singing gaudy show 
tunes in the shower. Setting her pen aside thoughtfully, she rose to her 
feet. Needing a break from her work she quietly slipped out of her gown 
and joined him.

Far below the residential quarters lay Eden&#146;s hanger and within a dragon 
slept. The Ragnarok, an enigma and a silent protective companion to 
those she ferried to the brink of death and back again. Eden watched 
quietly over this newest arrival with interest. Somehow she knew that 
deep within, they were very similar.

Within Eden&#146;s core Ellone rested against one of the many crystal pylons 
filling the chamber. The comfortable warmth combined with the rhythmic 
pulsing made her feel welcome and safe, despite its alien nature. Eyes 
closed in meditation she shared thoughts with the mystical intelligence 
powering the Garden. Some of the thoughts were trivial, some private but 
both entities welcomed the companionship, a welcome change to the 
loneliness that had filled their lives before.

*******************

The hour was late, and the moon hung low on the horizon, its silvery 
disk slipping slowly into the sea. Under the huge expanse of the 
heavens, two lovers lay. Quietly they fed each other dates and thin 
slices of fruit while a warm ocean breeze billowed through their hair. 
Quistis&#146; blue eyes gleamed in the darkness, a sign of her newfound 
powers. Linked eternally by love and sorcery, they shared a connection 
beyond mere words. Fujin never knew such peace and she relished these 
quiet moments above all else. But what truly made her happy was that 
Quistis felt the same.
