<p align="center">Dilemma</p>
<p>Seifer stepped off the  Balamb Garden accompanied to two unhappy SeeD. These were the same  two whom he ditched in the Training Center to fight T-Rexsaurs. Now,  mauled and scarred, the two of them were out to get Seifer in any way  possible.</p>
<p>“Smell that, boys?”  Seifer said breathing in the cool night air. “Smell of Balamb.  Inhale deep, boys, you’ll be able to smell Ma Dincht’s cooking.”  The two disregarded him and shoved him forward. “Easy, easy, boys.”  He said jumping forward. “I’m going.” Unknowing to all three of  them, someone watched him from the rooftops, their glare cold and  murderous. The figure watched as the three disappeared into a  building and it hopped down to the roof below, following and waiting.</p>
<p>Seifer looked down at  the old man staring up at him with cold eyes.</p>
<p>“Yer the one who  took over this town years ago, eh?” He said angrily.</p>
<p>“That was a long  time ago.” Seifer laughed nervously. “Er, let the past be,  right?”</p>
<p>“Pretty soon I’m  going to be a thing o’ the past!” The old man snapped. “You’ve  cost me at least 3 years of my already short life. You’d best be  prepared to give ‘em back!”</p>
<p>“Look, sir, I’m  sorry about what happened. I was a different man back then, I was  young, I was reckless, I’m sure you were the same way.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you go  comparing me to you, sonny!” The old man got up, waving his cane  wildly.</p>
<p>“Grandpa!” The  little girl jumped in front of the two. “Stop it!”</p>
<p>“What do you know?  You were but a child when it happened!”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t that  long ago, grandpa! He said he was sorry!” The little girl said.</p>
<p>“When will you  learn…sorry won’t bring back anything, doesn’t fix anything  either.” But the old man relented and sat back down. “What do you  want?”</p>
<p>“I’m looking for  my friends, Fujin and Raijin.”</p>
<p>“You mean the two  that helped take over the town?” He sneered. Seifer couldn’t do  anything except nod.<br />
  “They’ve got a small place by the port.  ‘S not much but they keep it nice, don’t bother us neither.” He  replied.</p>
<p>“Thanks.” Seifer  said. “And, I’m sorry.” The three of them exited out of the  small house. Seifer noted with a sigh that most of the residents  still remembered him. They either spat in his general direction or  hurried into their houses.</p>
<p>“Some welcome.  You're reeaaall popular with this crowd” The SeeD on his right  sneered. Seifer resisted the urge to whirl around and punch him. As  they approached the pier, Seifer noticed a huge dark figure towards a  small shack. He had a fishing pole in one hand and a bucket in the  other.</p>
<p>“Raijin?” Seifer  shouted. The dark figure turned to him and dropped both. The fish  that was in the bucket jumped out and flopped towards the pier and  into the ocean. <em>Probably for the best</em>,  Seifer thought with a small smile, remembering the last time Raijin  caught something.</p>
<p>“Se…Seifer?”</p>
<p>“COMMOTION?” A  smaller figure exited the house. In the little light that there was,  the black eye patch and shining hair was unmistakable.</p>
<p>“Fujin!” The woman  turned to him and her one eye went wide in shock.</p>
<p>“IMPOSSIBLE.” She  hissed.</p>
<p>“Nope, I’m right  here.” He said walking towards them. A movement behind Seifer made  him turn around and draw his gunblade. A small figure leapt at him  with a primal scream that echoed in the darkness. Seifer only had the  time to put up his Hyperion in defense before something sharp and  metal clanged against it. The surprise and force of the attack caused  Seifer's wrist to bend back and he recoiled in pain. In the darkness,  he couldn’t see who or what it was that was attacking him. He could  barely follow the movements of the figure. Whatever it was, it was  fast, tiny and had a weapon similar to Fujin’s. He swung at the  dark figure and prepared a fire in his other hand.</p>
<p>“DESIST!” Fujin  commanded and whatever it was that attacked Seifer stopped and  scurried behind Fujin.</p>
<p>“What the hell kind  of pet do you have?!” Seifer demanded.</p>
<p>“It’s not a pet,  ya know.” Raijin said.</p>
<p>“IS GIRL.” Fujin  said, stepping aside. “IS AMA.”</p>
<p>“Ama?” Seifer  said, eyeing the girl. She bore an uncanny resemblance to Fujin with  her silver hair and fierce glare. Her eyes were an amber color  instead of Fujin’s dark red.</p>
<p>“Long story short,  she’s Fujin’s little sister.” Raijin explained. Seifer’s eyes  nearly bugged out.</p>
<p>“NOT LIE.” Fujin  reassured. “MOTHER…”</p>
<p>“We got a letter a  while back from Fujin’s mom. We all thought she was an orphan, ya  know? Well, the letter confirmed that. ‘Cept, Fujin wasn’t an  orphan until a few months after you left. Turns out, her mother  abandoned her when she was little, ya know? But now we get this  letter that says she’s dead and Fujin has a little sister she needs  to worry about. So we go looking for her sister, ya know? And we  found her.”</p>
<p>“PROTECT.” Fujin  stated.</p>
<p>“She looks like she  can do a fine job of that.” Seifer said, flexing his wrist.</p>
<p>“WANT?” Fujin  demanded. Seifer winced. Even though he had gotten used to Fujin’s  way of talking, he also knew when she was really irritated.</p>
<p>“Look, I'm not here  to mess things up. I'm not going to run around the issue, I want you  guys back. Let's go back to being the posse that we used to be.”</p>
<p>“FOUND YOURSELF?”  She sneered. “LEAVE.” Fujin turned around and Seifer looked to  Raijin. Raijin shifted his gaze from the retreating woman to his old  boss. Finally he turned to follow Fujin.</p>
<p>“Sorry, ya know?  It’s just that...you left us first.” Just as Fujin was about to  disappear into the house, Ama scurried over to her and tugged on her  blue jacket. Fujin looked down at the girl. Ama looked at Balamb  Garden and then back to Fujin with wide eager eyes. Seifer watched as  Fujin’s expression turned to frustration and fist clenching and  then to a softer, more gentle demeanor. She turned around.</p>
<p>“WANTS TO GO.” She  said nodding her head towards Ama. Seifer stared at the little girl.</p>
<p>“Uh...can she even  talk?” Seifer asked. Fujin walked up to Seifer until she was less  than an inch away.</p>
<p>“HATE YOU.” She  hissed. “IF NOT FOR AMA...” She trailed off and walked back into  the house, slamming the door behind her.</p>
<p>“Does that mean  you’re coming?” Seifer shouted after her. Raijin, on the other  hand, looked more than pleased.</p>
<p>“I guess so! We need  some time to get our stuff, ya know. But I think we’ll be ready by  tomorrow.” He picked up Ama with one hand and swung her onto his  shoulder skipping. “You hear that, Ama? We’re going back to the  Garden!” The little girl giggled as Raijin skipped all the way back  into the house. Seifer looked back at the two body guards and  grinned.</p>
<p>“Looks like you two  have just been replaced.”</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Becca awoke to the  sound of someone walking around downstairs. She slipped into her  slippers and cautiously crept out of bed. Whoever it was moved  quietly, except for that one slip. She grabbed a pistol from  underneath her pillow and moved into the hallway. Out there, she lost  the sound of the someone moving. She could hear the noises of  everyone sleeping, from Cellia’s deep breathing to Andri’s flat  out snoring. She walked down the stairs and headed for the kitchen,  where she last heard the footsteps. The minute she entered, someone  grabbed the back of her neck and arm and threw her to the ground. She  let out a small cry of pain.</p>
<p>“Becca?” The  person jumped back and turned on the light. Becca looked up.</p>
<p>“Xu? What the hell  was that for?” She demanded, getting to her feet.</p>
<p>“I heard someone  creeping around!”</p>
<p>“I was creeping  around because I heard you creeping around!”</p>
<p>“I was trying not to  wake you!” Xu defended. She looked down at the pistol now halfway  across the floor. “Are you...often this uptight?” Becca rubbed  the back of her neck and sighed.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult to  say. No one’s ever attacked us but there are tons of people who  have cause to.” She replied. “So far the island’s security  keeps everyone out...who know what’ll happen if we’re found out?”  The two of them sat down. “So...what were you doing up so late?”  Xu blushed.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to  wake you...I was just going out for a stroll.” She replied. Becca  let out an exasperated sigh.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to  creep around. It’s scary like that.” Xu laughed a little and  Becca looked at her. “What?”</p>
<p>“Nothing...it’s  just...you look so ruffled right now.” The younger woman giggled.  Becca smiled and mussed Xu’s hair.</p>
<p>“Get to bed, silly.”  Becca picked up her gun and put the safety back on. She walked out of  the room and Xu’s eyes followed. When the older woman was out of  sight, Xu sat down on one of the chairs and tucked her head into her  arms. <em>What am I doing...? Why is this happening to me?</em> She thought as her mind went back to her dream. <em>This  feeling...</em></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p><em>“Becca...?  Will you be with me forever?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Silly, you only  say that to someone you love.”</em></p>
<p><em>“...Will you be  with me forever?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Hahaha, of  course...”</em></p>
<p><em>-</em></p>
<p><em>-</em></p>
<p>Xu  banged her head against the marble counter in frustration, recoiling  when she had brought it down too hard. Her eyes drifted to the tops  of her eye lids and she watched as the stars shined outside. Being  with Becca brought back so many feelings, so many unresolved  emotions. She tilted her head back and leaned against the back of the  chair. This place had a way of messing with her head. Here she could  be with the people she never had a chance to be with. These were the  friends she never had growing up in the Garden.</p>
<p><em>The  Garden...</em>Xu thought before it  promptly disappeared again into the back of her mind as images of  Becca flooded through her imagination. Becca meant the world to her  now from being just a memory. Surely that was what prompted these  dreams and images. Xu got up and walked up the stairs. Where she  meant to turn right into her own bed room, instead she walked to the  opposite end of the hall where Becca’s room was. She gently opened  the door and knelt next to Becca’s bed. The older woman stirred and  turned around, having just fallen asleep.</p>
<p>“Xu?  What’s wrong?” She asked. Xu lifted the covers and crawled in  next to her. “Xu?” Becca said with more surprise and alarm. Xu  lifted her head to say something just as Becca looked down. For a  brief moment, they exhaled at the same time, their breaths tickling  each other’s lips almost as if they had brushed skin. Becca sat up  and left the bed.</p>
<p>“Xu,  you have to understand. I am not...I’m in no position to...”  Without finding the right words, she left the room. Xu watched the  silhouette of the woman disappear from the door way before she fell  back onto the pillows. She put her hand where Becca had been but a  few seconds ago and pretended that the warmth she had left was an  actual body.</p>

<p>“You’re  in a chipper mood.” Selphie sneered as Seifer strolled by.  Following closely behind him were Fujin, Seifer and Ama. “Oh”  Selphie sighed but promptly raised and eyebrow when she noticed Ama  walking around, trying to take everything in at once. Seifer pushed  the button on the elevator and when the doors opened, Ama jumped  back, growling.</p>
<p>“IS  OK!” Fujin insisted, taking the little girl by the hand. Ama  cautiously entered the strange contraption. When the doors closed,  she started to bang against them, panicking because her only way out  seemed blocked. It only worsened as the elevator moved. It took both  Fujin and Raijin to calm her down and keep her from destroying  anything. When they reached the bridge, both were already worn out  and Ama jumped away, brandishing her weapon.</p>
<p>“NOT  HERE.” Fujin snapped and Ama put it away. Seifer burst through the  doors into Squall’s office.</p>
<p>“Yo,  pubes! Look who I found.” He said gesturing to the trio. Squall  nodded to the two of them and but frowned when he saw Ama.</p>
<p>“Who’s  the girl?” He asked.</p>
<p>“Oh,  this is Fujin’s little sis. Anyway, you’ll call those body guards  off now, right?” Squall put down his pen and paper.</p>
<p>“Why  is there a little girl with you? Have you explained to them what’s  going on?” Seifer shrugged sheepishly.</p>
<p>“Not  yet.” Fujin and Raijin looked at Seifer quizzically.</p>
<p>“What’s  going on?” Raijin repeated. “Is there something we should know?”  Seifer turned to face them and rubbed his hands together awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Um...let  me explain...”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Nida  had barely touched the door to the bridge when the door flew open,  hitting him in the face and pushing him aside.</p>
<p>“WAIT!”  Seifer pleaded as Fujin marched away with Ama in tow. Raijin looked  at the ground, still in the room. “WAIT!”</p>
<p>“NO.”  Fujin snarled. “AMA IMPORTANT!”</p>
<p>“She  doesn’t have to be with you all the time.”<br />
  “PROTECT!”  Fujin insisted, stopping Seifer in his tracks. “SISTER!”</p>
<p>“She’ll  be fine! There’s no safer place than the Garden! There are SeeD  crawling around this place! We could enroll her in classes, she’d  excel like no other!” Seifer tried. Fujin slapped him soundly,  causing even Ama to wince.</p>
<p>“NO.  NEVER.” Her eyes spoke words she could not. Seifer could see that  she didn’t want her little sister getting mixed up in the Garden’s  business, much less in his business with Ultimecia.</p>
<p>“Please...I  need...I need you guys.” Fujin glared at him and turned around,  dragging Ama.</p>
<p>“Ya  know...” Raijin’s voice stopped Fujin just as she pressed the  button to go down. “It might be good for Ama...” She whirled  around.</p>
<p>“WHAT?!”  She shouted, angry at the betrayal.</p>
<p>“I’m  serious...she’s got no friends back in Balamb. Everyone treats her  like...like...some beast. Here she can at least have friends who are  also trained in combat...and won’t find her as weird. She can be  like a normal kid with normal friends, ya know?” Fujin’s eyes  glared and softened repeatedly as she thought about what Raijin said.  Her eyes darted from Seifer to Ama, who was inspecting the vase  sitting on the table. She strode up to Seifer and grabbed his coat,  pulling his face close to hers so he could hear her hiss between her  teeth,</p>
<p>“IF  AMA HURT...” She pushed him away and looked back at Squall who sat  at his desk rearranging papers. “TEST?”</p>
<p>“I’ll  see when we can schedule her in.” He replied. He pressed a button  on the intercom. “When are you free to proctor an entrance exam?  Now? Really? That’s fine. Yes, she’s on the bridge.” Squall  released the button. “Quistis will be her proctor. She’ll be here  any moment.” Soon, the elevator door opened and Quistis stepped  out.</p>
<p>“I’m  here.” She said, then saw Ama. “Ah, you must be our little test  taker. Good morning, my name is Instructor Trepe.” She said  extending a hand out to greet her. Ama just stared blankly. Quistis  withdrew her hand awkwardly and went over to Squall’s desk, pulling  out a piece of paper from the pile. She handed the sheet to Fujin.</p>
<p>“If  you could please fill out all the information.” Fujin propped the  paper against the wall and grabbed a nearby pen. She quickly  completely filled out all the boxes and handed it back to Quistis.  Quistis skimmed through.</p>
<p>“Does  she know how to read and write? Or...even talk?” She said eying the  girl warily.</p>
<p>“A  little...her mother didn’t raise her quite the way normal people  do. She knows how to speak, and read and write a little but...it’s  all very basic, ya know? ‘Feed me’ ‘Danger’ Those sort of  things.” Raijin replied. “We’ve taught her more since she’s  been in our care...but it’s difficult, ya know?” Quistis nodded  in understanding.</p>
<p>“I  see. Well, depending on how she does on the reading and writing  portion of the exam, we may or may not be able to take her in.” She  replied. “Well, at least not the normal classes. We might have to  put her in some of the more basic classes, at least until she  adjusts.” Fujin watched Ama with sad eyes.</p>
<p>“PLEASE.”  Fujin pleaded. “DON’T.” Quistis smiled.</p>
<p>“It’s  ok, it would only be temporary until she develops the language skills  necessary to be in the regular classes.”</p>
<p>“NO...”  Fujin insisted.</p>
<p>“We’ll  see, ok?” Quistis said. She stuck out her hand again for Ama to  take. Ama looked at Fujin and she nodded. The little girl took  Quistis’s hand and the two went downstairs. Fujin clenched her  fists, worried.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Quistis  slammed the results of the test down on Squall’s desk. He looked up  and raised an eyebrow at her behavior.</p>
<p>“I’m  sorry, we can’t do it.” She sighed. “We can’t put her in a  basic class.” Squall picked up the packet and breezed through it.</p>
<p>“It  looks like we’re going to have to...she failed the reading and  writing portion of the exam entirely.”</p>
<p>“No,  look at her physical stats.” Squall went to the back and his eyes  scanned the page. He closed it, looking fairly surprised.</p>
<p>“She’s  near perfect.” He replied.</p>
<p>“That’s  why we can’t put her in a basic class. I’ve never seen anyone  with such high scores on the physical part of the exam.” Quistis  said.</p>
<p>“But  she’s near illiterate.” He countered.</p>
<p>“I  don’t care. The basic class will hinder her ability to sharp her  skill. With the proper education, she could be one of our best  fighters. She’s got a sharp mind, Squall, she just needs to be  taught properly.”</p>
<p>“I  can’t do it.” He said firmly.</p>
<p>“Squall!  You don’t understand do you? I gave her the basic magic test! I  gave her fire, ice and thunder. She played around with them for a few  minutes and when I threw a fire at her, she knew how to counter it  with ice! She instinctively knew! Fujin says that the girl has never  even seen magic before!”</p>
<p>“I  can’t do anything about it.” Squall repeated firmly, closing the  packet and putting it aside. “She tested into the basic class and  that’s where she’s going.” Quistis slammed her hand down on the  table, almost spilling Squall’s coffee.</p>
<p>“If  Cid were here, he’d make and exception!” She shouted.</p>
<p>“Cid’s  not here, now is he?” He said cooly.</p>
<p>“What’s  all this about Cid this, Cid that? I left ages ago.” The two  whirled around to see an old, familiar face entering the office.</p>
<p>“Headmaster  Cid!” Quistis greeted, standing up straight. Squall pushed his  chair back and stood too.</p>
<p>“Now,  now, no need for that. I’m not Headmaster anymore.”</p>
<p>“You’ll  be our Headmaster forever.” Quistis smiled. “What are you doing  here?” He chuckled a little bit.</p>
<p>“Oh,  just dropping by. Edea’s downstairs greeting others. So what’s  all the talk about me?” He asked, grinning.</p>
<p>“Look  at these sir.” Quistis snatched the results and gave them to Cid.  He pushed his glasses up and flipped through.</p>
<p>“She’s  impressive.” He remarked. “I think she’s set a new record for  her age bracket.”</p>
<p>“Sir,  she can’t read or write.” Squall protested. “There’s nothing  I can do. If she get special treatment, everyone in the basic group  will want special treatment and it’ll be chaos.” Cid nodded and  handed the packet back to Quistis. She balked.</p>
<p>“Surely  you don’t agree with him!” She gasped. “You said so yourself,  she...”</p>
<p>“Squall’s  right. I don’t make the rules.” He said before pausing. “Wait,  yes I did. But I can’t change them once they’ve been made. No  matter how talented this young lady is, she’ll fail if we put her  in the regular classes.” Quistis bit her lip in frustration. “I  mean, it’s not like there’s a rule, paragraph 132, section VIII:  Tests and Scoring that says that if an incoming student fails at one  or all sections of the test, that she...or he, can retake it before  next classes begin. And if she...or he can pass the exam by more than  20 points that she can join the next semester’s regular classes.  It’s a shame no one thought of a rule to allow that.” Quistis  looked at him, her eyes widening in realization. Cid smiled at her  fondly. “And if only the student had a young, impeccable,  intelligent instructor, well, everything would be all set, now  wouldn’t it?” Quistis let out a laugh and bowed to him.</p>
<p>“Thank  you so much.” She said. “I’ll go tell Fujin the good news.”  She left the room. Squall looked at Cid once more before rubbing his  aching head and getting back to the paper work.</p>
<p>“You’ll  get used to it.” Cid said, walking over and patting him on the  shoulder.</p>
