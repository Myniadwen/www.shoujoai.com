<a href="../ff8/teachrespect-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><div>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">With Quistis gone, another of those 
awkward silences had returned. The room seemed so much smaller without 
her friend’s comforting presence. Xu fidgeted nervously, trying to 
spread her palms as naturally as she could over the files in front of 
her. Typically, a picture of Fujin had managed to get shuffled to the 
top, and she was having difficulty concealing it from all angles, without 
looking like that was what she was doing.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">For her own part, Fujin seemed very 
ill at ease too, but that was understandable. Their last meeting had 
undoubtedly been very embarrassing for her, something Xu longed to console 
her for. Also, she was trying her best to conceal the folded piece of 
paper that Quistis had called her attention to. Xu felt sure she knew 
what that was, but was currently at a loss as to how to prevent this 
crisis. ‘Think Xusie, think!’ she shouted silently to herself.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;So… are you feeling better 
today? You seemed quite ill last time, and you haven’t shown up for 
your classes in a few days. I called but… I guess you weren’t feeling 
well?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She was sure that the nerves she felt, 
had made that sentence sound like it was in a foreign language. She’d 
been shooting for friendly and supportive, but she couldn’t help but 
feel like she’d just asked Fujin to accompany her to a wine tasting 
festival in Shumi dialect. Oh no, Fujin <i>was</i> looking… no wait, 
she was looking concerned. She followed her gaze… down to her side. 
Ah…</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;No, it’s fine now thank you. 
No broken bones. I’m afraid I was a bit of a baby about it, crying 
like that.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She grinned hopefully, trying to encourage 
Fujin to do the same, but a small, unconvinced nod was all she got. 
The truth was that the bruise had gone down, and only sharp movements 
brought any pain really. She’d pretty much forgotten about it. The 
bit about the tears was a bit of a lie though – she’d been crying 
for Fujin, not her pain. She wasn’t sure it was better if Fujin knew 
that or not…</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;VERY SORRY. REALLY SORRY.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin blanched, as if she was angry 
with herself about something. Xu was sure she hadn’t meant to say 
even that much, although her heart did leap a bit to hear the sincerity 
in Fujin’s voice. Now if she could just keep this conversation going, 
she might be able to steer it away from…</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;RESIGNATION.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin had jolted forward and thrust 
her piece of folded paper forward at Xu. It looked a bit worse for wear, 
rather limp like it had been folded, unfolded and folded again many, 
many times. This had clearly not been an easy decision for her to make. 
Nevertheless, Xu felt cold and numb, as if icy water had just been thrown 
over her. It couldn’t end like this, not when everything… well, 
it hadn’t really <i>gone</i> anywhere yet, but there was hope. She 
was sure there was.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin’s hand was trembling visibly 
- she was plainly as terrified at this whole business as Xu was. It 
was getting worse as the seconds ticked by. But Xu couldn’t move, 
she just sat looking at it, racking her brains for a way out. She met 
Fujin’s gaze. It was an odd look. She couldn’t tell whether Fujin 
just wanted her to take the letter and let her go, or to try and stop 
her. She dearly hoped it was the latter, she had to believe it was. 
Also, she reflected soberly, she couldn’t really move, or the files 
would be exposed…</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Just place it on the desk please,&quot; 
she finally managed in a small voice, her eyes still locked to Fujin’s.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin obediently lowered the paper 
to the desk. She dragged her eyes down to look at it for a moment, seemed 
on the verge of screwing it into a ball, but then pushed it towards 
Xu. Xu still couldn’t move. If she read it, she’d probably have 
to accept it. But that meant…</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;But you’ll… they’ll send 
you back to prison, you know? Is that really what you want &#39;Jin?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Before she could fully register that 
she had betrayed her feelings somewhat by using such an overly familiar 
name, Fujin had turned about and was hurrying towards the door. Xu started 
in alarm. She had to stop her, but how?! In a split second, the decision 
was made. It was an ugly thing to do, but there didn’t seem to be 
any other way. &quot;I’m sorry Jinny&quot; she thought to herself. 
&quot;I promise I’ll make this up to you, <i>I promise</i>.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mentally steeling herself, she raised 
her hand and brought her palm slamming down onto the desk as hard as 
she could. A thunderous boom echoed around the room. Committed now, 
Xu closed her eyes and shouted at the top of her voice:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;STOP RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE, MADAM 
LECTURER!!!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin whirled about with a look of 
alarm and (Xu was elevated to see), scared concern as she looked momentarily 
ready to spring back to the desk if anything had happened. Forcing herself 
to push aside the thought of how cruel she was about to be in the face 
of this sweet, brave gesture, Xu rose from her desk. Screwing up all 
her courage, she prepared to produce the necessary illusion of fury 
- a fury that she could scarcely even conceive of directing at the girl 
in front of her.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was working: Fujin had frozen in 
terror on the spot, before snapping to attention. She looked truly dazed 
and scared. Xu felt like the most wretched being in the entire world, 
but she had to do this. She was not going to let Fujin do this to herself. 
She quickly rounded the table, and with as authoritarian a stride as 
she could manage without aggravating her injury, advanced on her petrified 
charge. As she approached, she could see Fujin was recovering from the 
shock slightly however. She had to keep up the pressure, keep control 
of the situation out of her hands.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;What is the meaning of this, 
Madam?! You practically throw a resignation in my face out of the blue, 
and then think you can just sneak out and that will be that?!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin face dropped, as she tried to 
avoid her gaze. Xu stepped up to her, inclining her head to fiercely 
capture Fujin&#39;s gaze and disallow her any time to compose herself.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Look at me, look at me, Miss 
Fujin!! I think you misunderstand the situation here. <i>I</i> am the 
Headmistress of Balamb Garden, and <i>you</i> are merely one of my subordinates. <i>
I</i> decide when someone is dismissed and when they are not. And <i>

you</i> are not, do you understand?!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin nodded slowly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I asked you if you understood. 
Kindly reply when I ask you a question.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin looked up, a questioning look 
in her face. It seemed like a cry for help, that asked how Xu could 
do this to her. Xu remained unnmoved however (on the outside at least, 
as inside she was a heartbeat from grabbing Fujin in an embrace and 
begging her forgiveness). Given no solace in her search for compassion, 
Fujin nodded whilst croaking in a throaty, shocked voice:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;UNDERSTAND.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She was swallowing hard and sweating 
slightly. Her hands were curled up so tight, the blood was draining 
from them, Xu noted. She had to settle things down, establish control 
without all this bullying. She wasn’t sure how long she could keep 
this act up, before Fujin noticed how much it was hurting her to do 
it. ‘Get her sat down first’ she thought to herself. ‘Just get 
her away from the door’.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;So… you are not dismissed. 
You will take a seat at my desk, and then you will <i>wait</i> to be 
dismissed&quot; she ordered, turning towards the desk.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;PREFER TO STAND&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was said quite quietly and politely 
(by Fujin’s standards), but Xu could tell it was a test of sorts. 
Fujin probably suspected something was wrong. This kind of behavior 
was hardly normal in Xu. She had to be convincing, she couldn&#39;t show 
weakness now. Both their futures rested on this (as the possibility 
of a future without Fujin was now not an option).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu leaned forward, swivelled the guest 
seat around violently, before turning and grabbing Fujin viciously by 
the arm. She then pulled her savagely past her towards the seat. Stumbling 
into the chair in surprise, Fujin pulled free weakly, but looked as 
though she had been shot. She was chalk white, and was physically cringing 
away from Xu somewhat. Xu pointed firmly at the chair.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Sit down!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There was no hesitation now. Fujin, 
sporting an utterly shocked and defeated look, placed herself into the 
chair. She was blinking with her good eye, and Xu was sure tears were 
not far away. Xu could barely stand up straight at this sight. She wanted 
to tear out her hair and claw out her eyes. No punishment was too great 
for her at this moment. She felt like she was the most vile person, 
like she would be sick at any moment. She had to sit down too. Leaning 
against the table for support (Fujin still hadn’t turned her chair 
around), she suddenly remembered the photos. As Fujin swiveled sadly 
round, she quickly retook her seat, and shuffled the photo from the 
top.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She looked up, but apparently Fujin 
had noticed nothing. She looked through Xu with a expression that spoke 
of someone for whom life had lost its last wonders. Although feeling 
a sensation she was sure must be similar to what drowning felt like, 
Xu fought down her fear. She just had to hold onto the belief that Fujin 
wanted a way out of this as much as she did. She needed her help. ‘Just 
hang in there Jin’ she thought, ‘Just a little longer.’</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Now, I have some business to 
attend to, before I can deal with you. You will sit quietly until I 
have time to read this resignation. Then I will tell you if I accept 
it or not, and then you can go.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin looked like she might say something, 
but simply nodded mutely. Xu opened some of the more inconspicuous looking 
files, and began to read. She sat back in her chair, files on her lap 
and held in front of her. Tears rolled silently down her face, hidden 
by the pages, and it was all she could do to keep herself from sobbing 
out loud. Desperately, she re-read the material, looking for something 
to help her, particularly the sections which Quistis had pointed out. 
She stole glances every so often from behind the files. Fujin was simply 
sitting, staring out of the window behind her.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Or at least she appeared to be. Xu 
could swear that she caught her looking in her direction several times. 
She was trying to hide it, but she was shifting about quite a lot in 
her chair also. And she kept her hands out of sight under the desk – 
Xu was sure she wringing and clawing at them. For herself, Xu was trying 
with all her might to appear composed and comfortable. She was careful 
not to alter her seating overmuch, and forced her hands to remain still 
on the edge of the files, not tap the backs or run along the edges. 
She had to appear to be in control for now. Several times, she had to 
pretend to have something in her eye, so as to wipe away incriminating 
tears.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">All the while, the letter lay folded 
up and unread on the desk. Xu looked at it occasionally, and she knew 
Fujin was acutely aware of it at all times. She was sure neither of 
them really wanted her to pick it up, but no solutions had yet presented 
themselves. Quistis&#39; plan could work, but she couldn&#39;t bear the thought 
of breaking Fujin to that extent. It looked like it might be the only 
way however...</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eventually, the shadows began to lengthen, 
indicating that the afternoon was getting late. Several hours must have 
passed. Neither of them had spoken in all that time. Xu couldn’t remember 
ever being this scared, not even when Balamb Garden had been attacked. 
Having finished all the reading she could get away with, with the files 
that weren’t obviously about Fujin, she decided she couldn’t delay 
anymore. She put down the files on the desk, away from Fujin, and pulled 
her chair up to the table. Fujin immediately sat up straighter, but 
did not look in her direction.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu pulled the letter to her. It really 
was a sad specimen, beaten and forgotten, just like its owner she reflected 
miserably. She could feel Fujin’s eyes on her, burning into her. What 
was she going to do? With a flash of inspiration, she dropped the letter 
in front of her, and reached over to the intercom. She caught Fujin’s 
questioning gaze, and held it place as she spoke through the Headmistress’ 
general transmission system to the Garden at large:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i>&quot;Now hear this, now hear this. 
This is Headmistress Xu to all students and teachers of Balamb Garden. 
A problem with the staffing arrangements has arisen, which I am working 
tirelessly to rectify. Due to staff shortages in the near future, all 
free periods are suspended until further notice.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin looked so… betrayed that Xu 
thought she couldn’t continue. Her finger pressed into the intercom 
button so hard it threatened to crush it. She willed herself to go on:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i>&quot;Teachers will assemble in 
the staff room after lessons. I will meet you there, and we will be 
making changes to the timetable to add a further 3 hours of lectures 
to all student timetables every day, until these staff positions can 
be filled. I thank you for your co-operation.&quot;</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Flicking her eyes away from Fujin’s, 
she turned her attention to the letter. She could sense that Fujin was 
appalled, and probably feeling guiltier than ever, now that everyone 
was suffering on her behalf. &quot;Talk to me&quot; she willed. &quot;Stand 
up to me&quot;. Perhaps if Fujin became angry enough, they might be 
able to get at the truth that way. Xu spread the letter out, and slowly 
flattened it out on the desk, pointedly not looking up. She had to keep 
focus. She had to annoy Fujin, make her really mad. She pretended to 
read it over with interest before shaking her head:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;No, I’m sorry. This won’t 
do at all.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She handed the letter back to Fujin. 
She was dumbstruck evidently, and didn’t even reach out to take it. 
Xu placed it down in front of her when she refused to accept it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;WHY?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That question was clearly about more 
than just this, Xu thought. She obviously wanted to know why Xu was 
doing all this to her. And truth be told, Xu still didn’t know exactly 
how she was going to resolve this. She just needed to keep Fujin from 
leaving, and then perhaps something would happen. She had to get her 
to open up somehow, some way that didn&#39;t involve the court record...</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I’m afraid a clerical error 
has arisen. You can’t resign, because you aren’t enrolled. I checked 
the other day, and noticed you hadn’t completed the enrollment form 
for the teacher’s course.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This was an utter lie, but she was 
out of ideas. Fujin looked puzzled, before plucking up the courage to 
speak out:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;NO... COMPLETED FORM. LOOK AGAIN… 
PLEASE.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu stood up and headed over to a filing 
cabinet. She pulled out a fresh form and placed it in front of Fujin.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Why not just fill this one out? 
We can clear it up now. No problem really.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin looked baffled beyond measure, 
and more than a little exasperated as she took the form. She was realizing 
that Xu wasn’t being honest with her, Xu could feel it. She was too 
scared, too frantic in her search for an answer. She was supposed to 
be so clever, and she just couldn’t think of any way to get out of 
this. She just couldn’t do what Quistis said,,, it was too much. She 
turned away, motioning to the pen on the table. Out of the corner of 
her eye, she saw Fujin reach slowly for the pen, look back at her with 
a long stare, and then start to try to write. Once, twice, she tried, 
then she put the pen down. And then she’d say:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It’s out of ink Xusie.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu whirled around. The softness and 
tenderness of Fujin&#39;s voice took her completely by surprise. She felt 
her heart soaring to Fujin... and then put her hands to her mouth as 
she realized she had been fooled.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin slammed her palms on the desk, 
uttering a snarl of rage. She snapped to her feet, tearing the form 
in two. Xu opened her mouth to explain, but Fujin pushed her roughly 
aside as she moved to inspect the files. She sorted through them, nodding 
bitterly and shrugging Xu off as she feebly tried to stop her.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Satisfied that they were all about 
her, she picked up the pile, turned to face Xu and then threw the papers 
violently against the wall, keeping Xu in her glare all the while. The 
papers sprayed everywhere, and an angry wind seemed to blow them this 
way and that as Fujin strode through them and grabbed Xu by the arms. 
She was shaking, but with anger or fear or maybe something else, Xu 
wasn’t sure.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;LIES! TRICKED! TRUSTED YOU!!!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pushing Xu away, she made for the door. 
Xu was beside herself. She couldn’t think, she just had to do something, 
anything. Frantically, she called after her:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;All right, go then! I only wanted 
to help you! I care what happens to you &#39;Jin! That&#39;s the truth, I care 
about you! &quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin turned and looked at her. She 
looked so sad. Xu knew she was really only angry with herself. She was 
sad it had come to this: that they hadn’t been able to avoid this, 
when they both wanted to. Xu was sure of that now. Fujin wanted to stay 
with her, she just knew it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;WANTED TO BELIEVE YOU… REALLY 
DID.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Unconscious of what she was doing now, 
moment to moment, Xu raced across the room and slammed the half open 
door shut. She winced in pain as the bruise at her side flared angrily. 
Fujin reached out involuntarily, but stopped short of her, as she waved 
her away.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Then… then why are leaving?! 
If you really believed you deserve to be here, and that your happiness 
matters, then you&#39;d stay! But you don’t, do you? You’re still listening 
to <i>him</i>, aren’t you? You believe you should be punished, and 
that no-one should want to know you. Well, I do want to know you &#39;Jin, 
I want it more than anything!&quot; she howled in desperation.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin hands dropped, and she looked 
truly scared again. It had been the mention of her father, and the prospect 
of getting close to someone and hurting them. She shook her head, backing 
away. Xu tried to follow, but was buffeted back by a stiff breeze. Unwilling 
to admit defeat, adrenalin coursing through her now, she finally made 
up her mind. She had to do it. While he still had his hold on her, she&#39;d 
never be free.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She ran across the room again, dropping 
and crying out in agony to her knees, as her hip gave way temporarily.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;XU!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Propping herself up against the desk, 
Xu waved her back, and gritting her teeth to block the pain, started 
to search frantically amongst the papers. Fujin seemed paralysed, leaning 
towards her, but with a petrified look as she saw Xu rifling through 
the scattered files.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;You’re... making me do this 
&#39;Jin. I’m not going to let you do this to… to us! Oh, where is it?!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She called out in frustration and sobbed 
in pain as the bruise flared angrily. She punched the ground, trying 
to shock herself back into action.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;XU… please don’t. I’m not 
worth…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Don&#39;t use that tone with me, 
young lady!&quot; she laughed through the pain, &quot;<i>I’m </i>

the Headmistress! I&#39;m cold and I&#39;m callous, and I tell people who’s 
worthy! And I say…ah!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She staggered triumphantly to her feet, 
and advanced in mounting agony from her side, to where Fujin was now 
cowering near the corner of the room. She backed away until there was 
nowhere to go. Xu came to a halt, clutching at her side, but resolute.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Look at it Jin. Go on.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She lifted the crumpled court record 
up. The dates of sentencing were printed clearly at the bottom. Fujin 
sank into a squatting position, and covered her head in her arms, trying 
to shy away further. Xu knelt down and tried to prise away the arms. 
from the pathetic, whimpering bundle.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Jin…Jin! Shh. It’s alright. 
I’m here, and I&#39;m so sorry! Please just let me in!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin looked out at her from under 
her arms, staring weakly at the paper. She leaned over and placed her 
head sadly against Xu&#39;s chest, exhausted and empty of any further resistance. 
She closed her eyes and sobbed silently, as Xu slid an arm round her, 
and softly started to speak:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Sentenced to parole at Balamb 
Garden on the 15th, you were given a week to set your affairs in order 
with family and friends, it says.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin nodded.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;But you left the courthouse on 
the afternoon of the 15th, and arrived here on the evening of the 16th. 
You went home for one night, then spent the next day catching trains 
and the ship here. You can’t have been home more than 7-8 hours at 
most. Something happened didn&#39;t it? Jinny, <i>please</i> tell me. I 
can&#39;t bear to see you like this.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She squeezed Fujin to her encouragingly, 
and leant her head against hers and kissing her hair.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;NOT EVEN… not even one night&quot; 
she managed in a hollow voice.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu reached down and gently lifted her 
chin round to look up at her.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;You didn’t even stay that one 
night? Why?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so Fujin finally told her. In a 
cracking, distraught voice, she told the tale of how after her acquittal, 
she had traveled to her family home, only to be thrown into the street 
by her father. Her luggage ripped open and thrown after her, his words 
chasing her out of the town:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;<i>Billy Kellit’s son, Ann 
Marchant’s girl, both of them crippled because of you and your devil 
friends! You’re a disgrace you hear me! You’ve brought shame to 
this family, you filthy, disgusting ANIMAL!</i> <i>You&#39;re no child of 
mine</i>, <i>and you&#39;re not welcome here. Go back to your school - they&#39;re 
the only ones crazy enough to have the likes of you back. You&#39;re Evil 
child, pure Evil!</i>&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu couldn’t believe it. How could 
anyone have done this to her, let alone her own father? A father she’d 
loved even after he’d hated her just for being who she was, who’d 
blamed her for losing her eye in an accident on a hunting expedition 
he&#39;d set up. Who knew he was casting her out into the world, with nothing 
and no-one to hold onto? Fujin was rocking back and forth, tears flowing 
freely down her face, repeating the same words over and over:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;You’re evil, you’re good 
for nothing, YOU’RE EVIL!!!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu couldn’t stand it. She grabbed 
Fujin, pulled her to her and hugged her deeply. For more than an hour, 
maybe more, she just held the defeated girl, kissing her hair and rocking 
her gently. They cried until they had no more to give, then sat in a 
silence only broken by Xu’s soothing:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It’s okay &#39;Jin. I’m here. 
I’ve got you. You’re home now. Everything’s going to be alright. 
He can’t hurt you anymore.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It would be some time yet before Fujin
