Quistis stepped out of her bedroom groggily, she only slightly noticed 
Irvine standing half-naked in the front door.

&quot;What are you doing up?&quot; She sniffed and rubbed her eyes then gave him 
scalding look. &quot;Put some clothes on you slob.&quot;

&quot;You have a guest?&quot; He said with a great yawn motioning to Fujin before 
crawling back under his blankets on the couch.

&quot;Fu..Fujin?&quot; Quistis stammered then smiled brightly.

Fujin glanced over at Irvine then looked at Quistis quizzically.

&quot;He needed a place to stay.&quot; Quistis whispered to her. Fujin gave him 
another dry look then stood straight and serious.

&quot;BREAKFAST?&quot;

&quot;Sure, wait for me to get ready?&quot;

Fujin nodded.

&quot;Make yourself at home I&#39;ll be out in a jiffy.&quot; Quistis gave her a wink 
then hurried to her room.

Fujin nodded once more and waited till Quistis closed her door before 
moving. Irvine had already fallen back asleep as she walked towards the 
couch.

&quot;MOVE.&quot; She said simply, desiring to sit down.

&quot;Go away.&quot; He groaned.

She shoved him once lightly with her foot, having no desire to touch him 
in his present state.

&quot;Sit in the chair girl, leave me alone.&quot;

&quot;RUDE.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re the one waking people up, go away, don&#39;t you have children to 
eat or something.&quot;

Fujin soured, with one swift move she stepped behind the couch and 
flipped him unceremoniously onto the floor.

&quot;HEY! What do you think your doin?&quot; Irvine jumped up with a snarl.

Fujin sat down peaceably.

&quot;Lady, you have some real issues.&quot; He grumbled indignantly.

She looked him over with a bemused smirk.

&quot;What?&quot;

She glanced down at his boxers and chuckled.

Irvine suddenly felt very awkward, he shot her another foul look then 
grabbed his clothes and got dressed.

&quot;Why are you here anyway?&quot;

&quot;CONCERN, NOT YOURS.&quot;

&quot;Figured as much.&quot;

Quistis hurried out of the shower and got dressed. She gave herself a 
quick glance in the mirror and smiled. She felt better than she did in 
months and it showed. Feeling the urge to be a little frisky she slipped 
into a silky white blouse that hugged her curves and black skirt just 
shy of being risqu&eacute;. With a speed that comes only from practice she 
fixed her hair and dabbed on some makeup. Satisfied she stepped out into 
the living room, ready to go. Irvine and Fujin both stood as she 
entered.

Irvine whistled approvingly.

&quot;Quisty.&quot; He whistled his approval before bowing. &quot;I must say your 
looking mighty fine.&quot; Fujin growled low in her throat, bumping him aside 
with her hip as she stepped past him.

&quot;Watch where you&#39;re going girl.&quot; He said dangerously. He was in no mood 
to be putting up with female hostility especially after Selphie&#39;s little 
outburst.

&quot;Tisk, Fujin, be nice to Irvine he&#39;s had a bad few days.&quot; Quistis cooed.

&quot;That&#146;s a understatement.&quot; He moaned.

Fujin looked at him with blatant disinterest and then regarded Quistis.

&quot;READY?&quot; She stated flatly

&quot;Yeah I suppose, I really hope it&#39;s good news with Cid.&quot; Quistis 
fidgeted nervously as she moved to get her purse. She did however notice 
Fujin&#39;s awkward glance as she bent to retrieve it. Sadly she also 
noticed Irvine&#39;s.

&quot;This is going to be annoying with him around.&quot; She though glumly. No 
disrespect to Irvine, she loved the big lug like a brother but now was 
not the time for a third wheel. With a sigh she turned to face them.

&quot;Alright lets go.&quot; She said with a smile.

&quot;Irvine, I&#39;ll probably be gone most of the day, If you leave lock up 
before you do so, there is a spare key on the mantel.&quot;

&quot;Okay mom.&quot; He laughed.

&quot;Cute.&quot; She sneered at him playfully, Fujin shifted and glanced at her 
with a somewhat sour look. Quistis caught this look too and rejoiced 
mentally.

&quot;Oh she&#39;s jealous.&quot; She noted and loved it; it made her feel wanted. She 
glanced at Fujin and gave a quick wink to reassure her.

&quot;See you tonight then Quisty.&quot; He purred, Fujin ground her teeth but 
kept stone faced.

&quot;Miss Trepe will do Mr. Kinneas.&quot; Quistis said bluntly.

&quot;Ouch....I read ya.&quot; Irvine waved his hand like he had been burned.

&quot;I hope so. See you tonight.&quot; She said with an arched brow.

She turned and walked out the front door. Fujin followed quietly, but 
not before giving Irvine a foul glance. He was oblivious as he set of 
towards the bathroom to freshen up.

Quistis sauntered saucily up the hallway, a devilishly grin on her ruby 
lips. She could feel Fujin&#39;s gaze upon her and she smiled inwardly.

&quot;Quit skulking around back there.&quot; Quistis said, pausing for Fujin to 
catch up.

&quot;NOT SKULK.&quot;

&quot;Something on your mind?&quot;

&quot;NOTHING.&quot;

Quistis studied her a moment then smiled a slow rich smile.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin asked, shifting uncomfortably.

&quot;Hmm, nothing really.&quot; She reached out to brush the errant bangs from 
Fujin&#39;s face.

Fujin blushed and glanced away.

&quot;You&#39;re awfully shy today.&quot; Quistis said smilingly.

&quot;NOT.&quot;

Quistis leaned and whispered into her ear.

&quot;Love you Angel.&quot; She exhaled letting the warmth of her breath drift 
along Fujin&#39;s neck enticingly. Fujin moaned softly at the sensation and 
her knees nearly buckled. Her pale features grew flush, as she looked at 
Quistis in wide-eyed shock.

&quot;Okay I&#39;ll leave you be.&quot; Quistis giggled playfully and ran a finger 
along her jaw teasingly.

Quistis turned to walk away and was surprised when Fujin spun her back 
around, she was even more surprised by the dusky expression on her face. 
Fujin pressed tantalizingly close their bodies caressing each other 
lightly. Fujin ran a lazy finger down Quistis&#39;s arm as she looked up at 
her with a mysterious yet smoldering gaze. Quistis felt flush and her 
heart hammered in her chest, as fleeting worries of someone seeing them 
tickled the back of her mind. Her flirting had backfired it seemed but 
she had to admit she was enjoying it. Fujin breathed deeply as she 
pressed closer.

&quot;LATER...&quot; She said in the low throaty tone she used to whisper, Quistis 
had come to love hearing it and she tingled all over. Such a simple 
statement, but Fujin was able to say it with such tantalizing promise 
Quistis found herself standing in shock as Fujin stepped back with a 
lingering smile. With one last piercing look she turned and walked up 
the hall.

Inside she screamed at herself for being so blatant but that did not 
stop her from smiling.

**************************

Selphie sat in the living room floor of her and Irvine&#39;s apartment. 
She&#39;d not left it since he moved out.

&quot;I&#39;m a horrible person.&quot; She sulked.

&quot;No you&#39;re not.&quot; Rinoa said softly as she walked out of the kitchen with 
two steaming cups of cocoa.

&quot;Says you.&quot;

&quot;What, My opinion doesn&#39;t matter?&quot; Rinoa scoffed.

&quot;That&#146;s not what I meant.&quot; Selphie bounced her shoe across the living 
room.

&quot;I know. Here ya go.&quot; Rinoa laughed, and handed her one of the cups.

&quot;Thanks Rinoa.&quot;

&quot;No worries hon.&quot; Rinoa smiled warmly as she sat down by her.

&quot;How&#39;s Squall?&quot;

&quot;Pissed.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Selphie looked down into her cup.

&quot;He&#39;ll be okay.&quot;

&quot;Have you seen Celeset?&quot;

&quot;Not really, after meeting you she doesn&#39;t really want to meet anymore 
of us.&quot;

&quot;Gee thanks.&quot;

&quot;Sorry it&#39;s true.&quot;

&quot;I feel horrible.&quot;

&quot;Well to be honest you should.&quot;

&quot;I thought you was here to cheer me up.&quot;

&quot;What gave you that impression.&quot; Rinoa elbowed her playfully.

Selphie made a face at her which Rinoa promptly returned. Selphie 
giggled faintly and sipped her drink.

&quot;It&#39;ll be okay, everyone understands how stressed you&#39;ve been, you&#39;re 
always very moody when we go to Trabia.&quot;

&quot;I know, I&#39;m sorry for that.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re only human Selphie.&quot;

&quot;Darn you&#39;ve broke my delusion.&quot;

&quot;Funny.&quot;

&quot;Really Rinoa, what am I going to do now.&quot;

&quot;Go on.&quot; Rinoa shrugged apologetically.

&quot;I love the big lummox though.&quot;

&quot;I know you do and so does he.&quot;

&quot;You just hurt his feelings is all and burned his clothes and beat up 
his sister and....&quot;

&quot;I get the idea.&quot;

&quot;Sorry.&quot;

Selphie set her drink down and buried her face in her hands.

&quot;I&#39;m doomed.&quot;

&quot;Oh come now it&#39;s not that bad.&quot;

&quot;Yes it is.&quot; Selphie whimpered pitifully.

&quot;At least you have the place to yourself for awhile.&quot;

&quot;I guess.&quot;

&quot;You could always throw a party, that cheers you up.&quot;

&quot;I dunno.&quot;

Rinoa sighed and draped an arm around the girl.

&quot;It&#39;ll be okay Seph, you&#39;ll see.

*******************************

&quot;Why are we here again.&quot; Luccian said with growing impatience as he 
waited in the breakfast line

&quot;He said to grab breakfast and meet him at the pool.&quot; Archibald 
shrugged.

&quot;So we&#39;re his errand boys now.&quot; Luccian thought a moment then scowled. 
&quot;I&#39;m leaving this is a useless waste of time.&quot; He turned to leave.

&quot;He now you promised.&quot; Archibald looked at him blankly.

&quot;What.&quot; Luccian turned on him dangerously.

&quot;If you want my help going after that stupid rock, then you gotta help 
me get through Zell&#39;s course.&quot;

&quot;I hate you.&quot; Luccian growled.

&quot;Get over it.&quot; Archibald grunted then turned his back to him.

Luccian clenched his fist, he&#39;d put up with enough of this idiot. He 
stepped forward, then stopped. He needed Archibald&#39;s help if he wanted 
any hope of making it to the Cetra temples on the islands heaven and 
hell and Archibald knew it and abused the fact by taking the opportunity 
to talk crap. Luccian forced himself to calm down, he rejoined the line 
quietly and choose to ignore nay further comments from his idiot 
compatriot. He instead kept himself occupied with thoughts of how to 
conquer the trials ahead. His research turned up terribly little on the 
temples, few people knew of their existence. He surmised though given 
the dangers of the island itself the temple guardians would be far 
worse.

Though he held little respect for Zell he did have to admit he knew how 
to take care of himself. He could do worse than to actually try and 
learn from him.

He suddenly felt a chill and turned around.

&quot;Damn it.&quot; He mumbled.

Quistis and Fujin both stood in line behind him.

&quot;Luccian.&quot; Quistis nodded.

&quot;Miss Trepe you&#39;re back I see. How was the trip?&quot; He smiled, not wanting 
to any more ill will between them at the moment.

&quot;Fun enough. How&#39;s the class been while I was gone?&quot;

&quot;Matron Edea keeps everyone on a short leash. Your fan club thinks your 
getting the axe.&quot; He said bluntly.

&quot;So I&#39;ve heard.&quot;

He glanced sideways at Fujin who stared back with an icy gaze.

&quot;Well welcome back, hope to see you in class.&quot; He said with about as 
much emotion as a snake. He then turned and proceeded to get his 
breakfast.

&quot;ASS.&quot; Fujin murmured under her breath.

&quot;Shush.&quot; Quistis whispered.

&quot;TRUTH.&quot; Fujin said simply.

&quot;Shush.&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;Miss Quistis, Miss Fujin.&quot; Aeka called merrily from her seat. Both 
women turned searching.

&quot;Oh hey Aeka.&quot; Quistis called and waved. &quot;We&#39;ll be there shortly.&quot;

She looked at Fujin thoughtfully.

&quot;That is if you&#39;re okay with that?&quot;

Fujin looked at her warily but shrugged.

&quot;She&#39;s okay, she thinks your neat.&quot;

&quot;NEAT?&quot; Fujin was stultified.

Quistis giggled.

&quot;It&#39;ll be okay.&quot;

Aeka smiled brightly as the two approached.

&quot;Welcome back Miss Trepe!&quot; She beamed. &quot;WOW you look wonderful!&quot;

Fujin smirked.

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Quistis smiled fondly. &quot;Have you been good?&quot;

&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;d your field test go?&quot;

&quot;Oh I was terrified.&quot; She hung her head.

&quot;WHAT OCCURRED.&quot; Fujin asked as she and Quistis sat down.

&quot;We fought a Bomb and Zell nearly got blown up, but Nei, she&#39;s cool, she 
summoned Shiva to help out.&quot; Aeka giggled.

&quot;Well how did you do in the fight?&quot;

&quot;Oh well I haven&#39;t settled on a weapon and I&#39;m no good at hand to hand.&quot; 
She looked down and sighed. &quot;But I guess I&#39;m okay at magic but I never 
got a real chance to try.&quot;

&quot;Oh dear what happened?&quot; Quistis frowned.

&quot;I hit it in the eye with my shoe.&quot;

Fujin nearly laughed aloud but stifled it by taking a drink.

&quot;Well, um.&quot; Quistis blanched. &quot;Did it work?&quot;

&quot;Actually pretty good.&quot; Aeka smiled but was feeling more and more like 
an idiot.

&quot;INNOVATIVE.&quot; Fujin nodded as she took a bite of her omelet.

&quot;I guess so.&quot; Aeka said sheepishly.

&quot;Has Luccian been behaving?&quot; Quistis asked.

&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am, but I think he&#39;s being to nice.&quot;

&quot;DEVIOUS.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s what I think.&quot; Aeka nodded.

Quistis didn&#39;t want to think about him right now.

&quot;Did you two have fun, you guys seem chipper&quot; Aeka asked innocently.

&quot;Yeah it was fun.&quot; Quistis smirked.

&quot;What did ya&#39;ll do? I never been anywhere before, you guys are lucky 
you&#39;ve been all over the world.&quot;

&quot;What about you Miss Fujin did you enjoy yourself? You seemed awful 
tired before you left?&quot;

&quot;ENJOYABLE.&quot; Fujin stated with a shrug.

&quot;You don&#39;t like to talk much do you.&quot;

&quot;Talking is painful for her.&quot; Quistis pointed out gently.

&quot;Oh I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Aeka offered immediately.

Fujin shrugged it aside.

&quot;Well I&#39;m glad you two had fun you needed some time away from 
everything.&quot;

&quot;Yeah I did.&quot; Quistis laughed.

&quot;You will be coming back right?&quot; Aeka asked pleadingly.

&quot;I believe so.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; Aeka sigh in relief.

&quot;Has Edea been treating you guys alright?&quot;

&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am, she&#39;s nice and all but she&#39;s kinda scary.&quot;

Fujin chuckled faintly at that.

&quot;Tsk, the both of you.&quot; Quistis chided.

&quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;s things going with Royce?&quot;

Aeka blushed brightly and giggled.

&quot;Wonderful, we&#39;ve been hanging out more, if I didn&#39;t know better I&#39;d 
think he likes me.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s to had to believe about that?&quot;

&quot;Oh you know.&quot; Aeka sighed and blushed.

Fujin arched a brow at the turn the conversation was taking the two 
seemed a lot closer than she thought.

&quot;Aeka you have to learn to have a little more confidence in yourself. 
Take Fujin here for example.&quot;

&quot;ME?&quot; Fujin wasn&#39;t thrilled about being used as an example.

&quot;She&#39;s had a hard time but she pulled through because she has faith in 
herself, she&#39;s one of the most confidant people I&#39;ve known.&quot;

&quot;Hardly.&quot; Fujin thought.

&quot;STUBBORN, MORE LIKE.&quot; She pointed out.

&quot;Well that&#146;s true too.&quot; Quistis smiled at her warmly.

&quot;HUMPF.&quot; Quistis and Fujin said in unison. Quistis laughed playfully. 
Aeka not sure if she should just smiled.

Fujin gave Quistis an indignant look and went back to eating.

Aeka looked at the two and smiled brightly.

&quot;They&#39;d make a good couple.&quot; She thought to herself. She thought back to 
her conversation with Quistis and wondered if anything happened, they 
where defiantly closer.

&quot;Well hon I have to get going or I&#39;m going to be late.&quot; Quistis said 
sadly as she got up. Fujin stood to follow.

&quot;Oh stay and finish eating silly.&quot; Quistis bid her to sit. &quot;Aeka&#39;s good 
company, aren&#39;t ya Aeka?&quot;

&quot;If you say so Miss Trepe.&quot;

Fujin looked at Aeka a moment then settled back in her seat. Quistis 
leaned to whisper in her ear.

&quot;I&#39;ll see you later.&quot; She said teasingly.

Fujin just nodded impassively.

&quot;Kay I&#39;m off you two, wish me luck.

&quot;GOOD LUCK.&quot; Fujin looked at her somewhat sadly, she didn&#146;t want her to 
go.

&quot;Good luck Ma&#39;am don&#39;t let them get you down.&quot;

&quot;Thanks guys.&quot; Quistis waved farewell, giving Fujin a gentle thoughtful 
smile before she left

Aeka waited a moment as Fujin casually went back to her meal.

&quot;She glad your back you know.&quot; Aeka said with a large smile.

Fujin looked up cautiously.

&quot;Seriously.&quot; Aeka nodded.

Fujin shrugged, she had no idea what to say to that considering the 
circumstances.

&quot;You should give her a chance, she really likes you, she&#39;d be a great 
friend if you let her.&quot;

Fujin&#39;s first thought was to snap at the girl but found she couldn&#39;t. 
After all it was true, even though Aeka obviously had no idea how much 
so. Aeka smiled softly at her then nibbled absently on her toast.

&quot;Or perhaps she does know.&quot; Fujin thought. No point worrying about it 
either way she figured.

&quot;THE BOY.&quot; Fujin said with an obvious detachment.

&quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;ROY?&quot;

&quot;Royce?&quot;

&quot;LIKE.&quot; It was more a statement than a question.

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;TELL.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s what Miss Trepe tried to tell me but its more difficult than 
that.&quot;

&quot;SIMPLE.&quot;

Aeka giggled.

&quot;She pretty much thought so too until I found out she had the same 
trouble.&quot;

Fujin nearly choked on her juice. She arched a brow inquisitively.

&quot;She said she liked someone but didn&#39;t know how to tell them.&quot;

Fujin did not like how this was going, the girl was playing games she 
presumed.

&quot;What about you?&quot;

&quot;WHAT ABOUT.&quot; Fujin said defensively.

&quot;You have an eye for anyone?&quot;

Fujin, to her credit kept cool and chose to remain silent.

&quot;Sorry.&quot; Aeka said meekly.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry your beautiful I&#39;m sure someone will come along.&quot;

Fujin saw her chance to turn the conversation off of herself.

&quot;SHALLOW.&quot; She stated with venomous calm and sincerity.

&quot;What?&quot; Aeka stammered at the accusation.

&quot;BEAUTY IRRELEVANT.&quot;

&quot;I did not mean anything I was just...&quot;

&quot;SOUL IS FOREMOST.&quot;

&quot;I know...&quot; Aeka hung her head in shame. &quot;I was only trying to cheer you 
up.&quot;

&quot;FAILED.&quot; Fujin said with the bluntness of a mallet.

Aeka felt ill and wanted to hide under the table, anything to get away 
from Fujin&#39;s intense scrutiny.

&quot;I....&quot; She started but her tongue felt like lead wrapped in an old 
sock.

Fujin smirked at her.

&quot;TRIED, THOUGH.&quot; She said before taking a bite out of her biscuit.

&quot;Sorry Ma&#39;am if I offended you.&quot;

&quot;DID NOT.&quot; Fujin assured her.

&quot;I guess I should think first.&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t like me do you?&quot;

&quot;DOES IT MATTER?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;WHY?&quot;

&quot;Well because your Miss Trepe&#39;s friend?&quot;

&quot;ONLY REASON?&quot;

&quot;No, I look up to you like I do Miss Trepe.&quot;

That was a surprise to Fujin and she immediately felt bad for being so 
harsh with the girl.

&quot;I admire you, you&#39;re both strong and respected you don&#39;t have to worry 
about anything, you can take care of yourself.&quot;

&quot;BELIVE THAT?&quot; Fujin nearly laughed.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Aeka nodded.

&quot;NOT RESPECTED.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot;

&quot;EVERYONE FEARS OR HATE.&quot;

&quot;At least no one bothers you.&quot;

&quot;SMALL COMFORT.&quot;

Aeka frowned thoughtfully as Fujin continued.

&quot;STRONG?&quot; She smiled grimly as she flexed her hand. &quot;STRENGTH LIKE 
BEAUTY.&quot;

Fujin took a breath, her throat started to hurt.

&quot;IS FLEETING.&quot;

Aeka felt humbled and very na&iuml;ve&#39;.

&quot;ADMIRE QUISTIS.&quot; Fujin spoke firmly. &quot;STRONGER WHERE MATTERS.&quot; She said 
simply gesturing to her heart.

&quot;I understand.&quot; Aeka said quietly.

&quot;DON&#39;&#39;T BE LIKE ME.&quot; Fujin said with a hint of sadness in her voice. She 
stood and dumped her tray then looked once more at Aeka.

&quot;TELL HIM.&quot; Fujin said simply then quietly left the cafeteria.

*******************************

Luccian had lost control, he, Archibald and Zell had been participating 
in a sparring match when Zell got the upper hand. Zell was meaning to 
teach the temperamental youth a few new techniques. However, Luccian 
taught him something by unleashing firga spell. It was against Balamb&#39;s 
rules to launch spells in the building except in the training center. 
More importantly though it was dangerous and considered poor 
sportsmanship to do so in sparring sessions. Zell had seen glimpses of 
Luccian&#39;s temper before and now that he experienced it himself he was 
not amused. Zell leapt back to escape the majority of the blast even 
though the magical fire scorched his clothing.

&quot;Lou you&#39;re about to piss me off.&quot; Zell said calmly as he slipped out of 
his smoldering coat.

&quot;I&#39;m more than you expected eh Dincht?&quot; Luccian said with a sly grin as 
he circled out of reach, Luccian was no fool he knew his hand to hand 
skills where no match for Zell&#39;s. However he did feel his talent with a 
sword, would put them on equal footing, even though his usual blade was 
replaced with wooden training boken.

&quot;Archie.: Zell called with a smirk. &quot;You&#39;re boy here always so cocky?&quot;

&quot;Pretty much.&quot; Archibald snorted in annoyance as he watched from the 
sidelines with the other students, who where now chattered in excited 
whispers.

&quot;No one asked you, fat ass.&quot; Luccian shouted bitterly but never taking 
his eyes off his formidable teacher.

&quot;You get a few spells and all of a sudden you&#39;re king of the hill huh, 
is that it?&quot; Zell chuckled as he crouched into a ready stance.

&quot;Something like that.&quot; Luccian sneered. &quot;Don&#39;t try to goad me into a 
mistake Dincht I&#39;m better than that.&quot;

&quot;I think Fujin would disagree with ya Lou.&quot; Archibald laughed.

Luccian twitched but kept himself in check. Zell noticed this arched a 
brow then stood straight and let his guard down.

&quot;Is that mess what this is all about Luccian?&quot; He asked with a hint of 
annoyance.

Luccian thought about taking advantage of his lax stance but knew 
better.

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; He asked cautiously.

&quot;That skirmish with Fujin in the Gym. Is that what&#39;s got you trying to 
come in here and prove yourself. You shouldn&#39;t let your temper get the 
better of you. If you come here to fuel some petty vendetta you can just 
get out. I don&#39;t teach with hate and anger. I&#39;m not Fujin nor your 
Father, or whoever else you think you need to prove something to.&quot;

Zell said with obvious disappointment.

Luccian tensed and quaked a moment then burst

&quot;I don&#39;t need to prove myself to you or anyone!!&quot; He screamed in an 
abrupt rage that took even Archibald by surprise.

&quot;Must have hit a nerve.&quot; Zell blinked in shock as Luccian leapt high 
into the air, black fire engulfed him as rose...

&quot;HADO-ZEN!!&quot; Luccian bellowed and flew blade first at him, streams of 
dark energy trailing behind as his midnight hued coat billowed like the 
wings of some nightmarish bird of prey.

&quot;Damn it to hell.&quot; Zell clenched his teeth and readied to block the 
incoming attack. Abruptly Luccian stopped short his charge and calmly 
sheathed his sword, while the crackling energy dissipated as quickly as 
it appeared. He smirked snidely at Zell who promptly scowled

&quot;What do you think you&#39;re playing at Luccian!&quot; Zell shouted in outrage 
and ran at him with half a mind to beat him senseless. He grabbed 
Luccian by the collar, and although Luccian was a good half-foot taller, 
Zell lifted him into the air and threw him onto his rear.

&quot; Are you out of your damned mind, unleashing an attack like that 
indoors, people could&#39;ve got hurt.

&quot;Who goaded who?&quot; Luccian chuckled proudly and stood. &quot;Besides I didn&#39;t 
finish the attack. What was that you was saying about tempers?&quot; Luccian 
asked with mock curiosity.

Zell blinked and realized he&#39;d been played.

&quot;Damn.&quot; Zell laughed and nodded good-naturedly. &quot;That was pretty screwed 
up and reckless. But I hear where you&#39;re coming from.&quot;

Luccian smirked and walked off without a word with Archibald following 
dutifully behind. Zell followed him with his eyes and frowned.

&quot;Bad news.&quot; Zell thought to himself before clapping his hands getting 
his students attention.

&quot;Alright shows over line up!&quot;

The junior classmen hopped to their feet and ran to their positions, 
awaiting interactions.

*****************

&quot;I&#39;m going to do it.&quot; Aeka chanted in her mind as she sat silently in 
her seat watching Royce with fawning eyes. The class had gathered for a 
special weekend class for those with further interest in summoning, in 
which Edea called forth Siren to explain in detail the idea of the dream 
world; the realm in which all summoned creatures existed or the Umbra as 
the inhabitants called it. Royce was captivated by the alluring 
creature&#39;s words, as was all the male students, a byproduct of her alien 
nature Edea assumed.

Siren relished her time in the mortal world, as did all her kind, 
however, she was unaccustomed to such interactions with mortal beings. 
She did not let her nervousness stop her from trying her best to explain 
things.

&quot;We exist outside the laws of the mortal realm.&quot; She started smoothly. 
&quot;In the Umbra we have no corporeal form, as you know it.&quot; She paused a 
moment as she thought about how to continue.

&quot;Now as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve learned, some like myself have developed a 
symbiosis with the mortal realm and of it&#39;s inhabitants. In times past 
we never knew the myriad of experiences mortal creatures could 
experience and our time with you has taught us much.&quot; She stood and 
walked towards class, every eye in the room was locked upon her. &quot;The 
ability to manifest physical forms even for such short times has enabled 
us to enjoy many possibilities of the flesh.&quot; Her lips curled into a 
rich smile as she looked down at Royce who was nearly falling out of his 
seat, she lowered her head cattily and walked over to him. &quot;Everything 
from pleasure.&quot; She ran a finger along his jaw and softly closed his 
gaping mouth. &quot;To pain.&quot; She added with a soft snarl as she extended 
long thin talons from her fingertips with a metallic sounding slice. 
Royce recoiled in shock and fear as the razor tipped talons glimmered 
inches from his face, he looked as if he would faint. Nervous laughter 
echoed quietly around the room.

Edea smiled to herself, she&#39;d gamble Royce would learn a lesson from the 
scare. Siren chuckled lightly and sheathed her claws.

&quot;Hussy.&quot; Aeka grumbled angrily to herself, she was madder though at 
Royce&#39;s display.

&quot;While most are content to enjoy the time we have here others would 
choose to stay longer, even though it is terribly dangerous for our 
hosts, very often when we manifest the energy released shunts our host 
into our world, nature hates a void so to speak.&quot; She shrugged 
impassively. &quot;While this is only temporary, usually lasting as long as 
we are here. Some of my more materialistic brethren become drunk with 
the sensations of mortal life and refuse to let themselves slip back 
into the realm of dreams.&quot; Her gaze darkened with a seriousness that 
chilled the very room.

&quot;The poor soul forced into our world becomes tainted with the dark 
desires streaming back to them from the ones who refuse to return. These 
black energies manifest into what mortals call nightmares, and while 
your kind only glimpse such entities in while you sleep. Those poor 
souls trapped in our world with no natural defense find that what where 
only figments of troubled sleep are in their new reality creatures of 
terrible power and rage. The soul trapped in such a state has no hope of 
defeating such an entity fore it is the embodiment of their fears 
itself.&quot; Several students where visibly shaken now. Siren smiled a sad 
smile as she fanned the rainbow hued feathers that lined her head 
nervously, she hadn&#39;t meant to scare the youths so, but they needed to 
know the facts.

&quot;What finally happens to them, the ones trapped in the umbra?&quot; Aeka 
asked shakily, she&#39;d forgotten all about Royce&#39;s raging hormones.

&quot;They die.&quot; Siren said in a soft matter of fact voice. She was not here 
to sugar coat things. &quot;Upon their deaths the one they summoned is forced 
back to the umbra where he absorbs the spirit of the one who died and 
with it his memories, dreams and desires which just make the errant one 
lust for more and it seeks yet another host. It&#39;s like what you&#39;d call 
an addiction.&quot;

&quot;You and yours are from the Umbra why can&#39;t you protect someone trapped 
there?&quot; Nei asked with a wary expression, she was the only one in class 
besides Rinoa to feel bold enough so try summoning this early in the 
course.

&quot;Even though the one trapped is in our realm she is not of our realm and 
therefore exists outside of our reality.&quot;

&quot;Like a ghost in the world of ghosts?&quot; Aeka said hauntingly.

&quot;Exactly.&quot; Siren nodded.

&quot;It&#39;s any wonder why anyone risks it.&quot; Royce said bluntly, the 
horrifying tale having broken his captivation.

&quot;Very few people do, but know this only bond with Guardian forces you 
know of or that others of my kind can vouch fore. We have formed a guild 
so to speak to keep track of those willing to live in peaceful symbiosis 
with the world.&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;ve heard of people using guardians to fight other humans as well 
as other summoned guardians?&quot; Rinoa spoke up, she knew far more about 
the subject than others in the class but this was something that 
troubled her for a while.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Siren shook her head would have laughed if not for the grim 
consequences for mortal in such a battle.

&quot;You have to see it from out perspective.&quot; She fanned her wings again 
nervously; this would be a tricky question to answer without being 
offensive.

&quot;To us, when we fight each other in this realm we know we cannot die, 
therefore battles mean little. To be perfectly honest when I said we 
formed the guild it was to make sure mortals did not junction with a 
rouge spirit. Mortals would cease calling upon us if rogues were rampant 
and that wouldn&#39;t be beneficial to anyone.&quot;

&quot;Selfish, but I see your point I guess.&quot; Rinoa said without hiding her 
contempt.

&quot;Sorry child but the truth is the truth, mortals use us and we use them 
in return we have little need to understand what drives you to battle 
each other.&quot;

&quot;Siren, thank you for you time.&quot; Edea broke in abruptly. Siren turned 
and bowed respectfully.

&quot;Always a pleasure Milady you have a promising class I sense great 
potential in many of them.&quot;

&quot;We try.&quot; Edea said demurely. Siren turned to face the class and smiled 
apologetically.

&quot;I hope I did not frighten you, but its best you all knew the facts. Now 
if you all will excuse me I regret that I must leave.&quot; She bowed and 
with a bright flash and faint burst of ocean spray she was gone.

&quot;That ends today&#39;s class students, you have your assignments have a good 
evening, and Aeka I want to hear what you decided upon, while amusing a 
shoe is not a reliable weapon in the field.&quot;

Aeka blushed profusely amid friendly ribbing from her fellow Treppies.

&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am.&quot; She squeaked as she gathered her books. Royce smirked at 
her as he hurriedly stuffed his books into his bag.

&quot;See ya Aeka, I&#39;m heading into town we&#39;re supposed to be stopping in 
Dollet within the hour so I need to hurry.&quot; He babbled and ran out the 
door in a flash.

&quot;Royce..&quot; She tried to call for to wait but was to late. &quot;It can 
wait...&quot; She mumbled bitterly. She began to doubt if she&#39;d ever get the 
courage to tell him how she felt.

With a sigh she slipped on her backpack and trudged out the door.

********************

Quistis stood in Cids office with a guarded expression, Xu was dutifully 
going through a stack of papers in her lap, neither women said two words 
to each other since she&#39;d entered the room. She turned at the sound of 
Squall and Cid approaching, both men paused at the sight of her. 
Squall&#39;s eyes darted every which way to avoid any potential embarrassing 
glances. Cid however smiled appreciably a moment then went on to his 
seat without further incident. Quistis had honestly only dressed up to 
get a rise out of Fujin, shed not really considered anyone else.

&quot;No use worrying now.&quot; She thought with a grin as she and Squall found 
seats.

&quot;Okay lets see here.&quot; Cid said thoughtfully as Xu leaned forward to hand 
him the paperwork she&#39;d been playing with. She gave Quistis a courteous 
nod as she settled back in her seat.

&quot;Okay....&quot; Cid mumbled to himself as he read over the sheets. &quot;I 
see....&quot;

Squall rubbed his temples, he had no idea why Cid insisted in making him 
come here for this. He glanced at Quistis without really thinking about 
it and she winked at him playfully.

He started and sank into his seat grimly trying to avoid looking her way 
again. Quistis shook with quiet laughter, she loved getting under his 
skin, and he made it so easy sometimes.

&quot;Miss Trepe.&quot; Cid said getting her attention and removing his glasses.

&quot;Yes Sir.&quot;

&quot;Well first off, how was your vacation?&quot;

&quot;Fine thanks, we ran into Raijin, he says hi to everyone, ya know.&quot; She 
smirked.

Squall rolled his eyes as did Xu.

&quot;Everything went okay then, Fujin give you any trouble?&quot;

&quot;No sir, her behavior was exemplary.&quot;

&quot;No problems then?&quot; Cid smiled with his tired fatherly eyes.

&quot;Not a one sir.&quot; Quistis beamed, she was in a terribly good mood, 
regardless of what happened today she resolved herself to getting back 
to normal.

&quot;Good, good.&quot; Cid nodded and clucked his tongue as he donned his glasses 
once more. &quot;Then I assume the calls I got from the local authorities of 
a unknown vessel bearing Balamb&#39;s crest terrorizing the resort are 
unfounded?&quot;

Quistis paled.

&quot;Yeah well...&quot; She started, shifting in her seat uncomfortably, Squall 
and Xu both locked at her suspiciously.

&quot;That would be my fault.&quot; She lied, she had no desire to see Fujin get 
in trouble, as she was on thin ice as it was.

&quot;That&#146;s very noble of you.&quot; Xu laughed dryly. Squall smirked at that and 
ran his hand through his hair.

&quot;Zell said you&#39;d say that, he explained the whole thing.&quot; Cid said 
leaning back in his chair.

&quot;He did?&quot; Quistis looked confused.

&quot;He told me it was his doing, something about a argument and running 
from authorities.&quot;

&quot;But it wasn&#39;t really his fault.&quot; Quistis tried to interject.

&quot;He said you&#39;d say that too.&quot; Cid smirked.

&quot;Quistis you really need to quit going easy the others they&#39;ll just take 
advantage of you.&quot; Xu smiled, Quistis was taken aback by the woman&#39;s 
sudden friendliness.

&quot;As a instructor you need to be more strict with you&#39;re students former 
or otherwise.&quot; Cid said sternly.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry sir.&quot; Quistis said, still baffled. &quot;Wait?&quot;

Xu laughed.

&quot;You mean I?&quot; Quistis babbled.

&quot;Yes you get to keep your license.&quot; Cid smiled.

Quistis screamed with joy and leapt out of her seat and hugged Squall 
who nearly had a fit.

&quot;Careful Quisty Rinoa may come hunting for you.&quot; Xu said helping her off 
him.

Quistis looked at Xu catiously.

&quot;You haven&#39;t called me Quisty in months.&quot;

Xu scratched her head and blushed. Squall took the opportunity to 
scamper out of the room.

&quot;Yeah I know.&quot; Xu sighed. &quot;I&#39;ve been a real bitch lately.&quot;

Quistis nodded in agreement but chose to remain silent.

&quot;Anyway someone bluntly made that obvious to me and now I&#39;m 
apologizing.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s all good and all ladies but if we are done here I&#39;d like to go 
to lunch now.&quot; Cid said from his seat, all but forgotten

&quot;Apology accepted.&quot; Quistis said quickly and hugged her old friend 
before facing Cid as she bounced with joy.

&quot;Thank you sir.&quot; She bowed.

&quot;Yes, yes I&#39;m wonderful.&quot; Cid laughed and shooed them away.

Quistis and Xu quickly exited the office and headed to the elevator.

&quot;So who&#39;s the lucky fella?&quot; Quistis asked as they entered. Xu giggled 
and smoothed her uniform absently.

&quot;Come on Xu you&#39;ve never been shy before, you said someone got onto you 
and now you&#39;re all aglow.&quot;

&quot;Nida.&quot; Xu spat it out then blushed brightly.

&quot;Wow impressive, he actually came down from his perch huh?&quot; Quistis 
whistled.

&quot;Har Har.&quot; Xu pouted. &quot;He&#39;s actually rather sweet we&#39;ve had dinner and 
been out a few times. He not at all the lofty loner people think he is.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take your word for that.&quot;

&quot;What about you, you seem far more bubbly than I&#39;ve ever known you, and 
the outfit, how can you even breathe in that? I&#39;m thinking you&#39;re out 
fishing.&quot; Xu smiled wolfishly at her.

Quistis looked sheepish.

&quot;That obvious huh?&quot;

&quot;Uh huh who is it, better not be Squall again I saw how you where 
treating him.&quot; Xu scowled.

&quot;Oh heavens no.&quot; Quistis laughed brightly. &quot;He&#39;s just fun to torment.&quot;

&quot;Then who then?&quot; Xu poked her.

&quot;I dunno yet to be sure.&quot; Quistis shrugged.

&quot;Still looking eh.&quot;

&quot;That works.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot;

Quistis giggled.

&quot;Here&#39;s my floor. Take care, don&#39;t be a stranger.&quot; Quistis said quickly 
as she stepped out of the elevator.

&quot;Hey wait!&quot; Xu shouted as the door shut. &quot;You brat!&quot; Quistis heard her 
yell as the elevator ascended.

&quot;Now to find Fujin and give her the good news.&quot; She thought as she 
smoothed her blouse and skirt.</pre>
