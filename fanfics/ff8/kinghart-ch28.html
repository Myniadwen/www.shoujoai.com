<p align="center">Make Me a Girl</p>
<p>Seifer  lay on the deck of the Balamb Garden looking up at the stars. He  listened to the slightly distant sound of the Trabia Snow Angels  playing. He felt oddly at peace with the world, finding it a somewhat  strange sensation when he was a man condemned to death.</p>
<p>“I wonder how Fujin and Raijin are doing.” He thought. “After everything…”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p><em>“You leaving?!” Raijin demanded.</em></p>
<p><em>“Yup. Going on a journey of ‘self discovery’ or something like that.”</em></p>
<p><em>“BULLSHIT.” Fujin hissed. Seifer winced a little at her sharp comment.</em></p>
<p><em>“Don’t be like that Fujin.”</em></p>
<p><em>“LIES!” She shook her head furiously.</em></p>
<p><em>“Fujin’s  right, ya know? You wouldn’t just go off like that without a proper  reason. We’re your posse, ya know?” Raijin agreed. Seifer sighed,  having been cornered.</em></p>
<p><em>“Look, I’m just trying to away for a  little, wait until tempers cool down. Once that happens, I’ll come  back, try and make peace with everyone and whatnot.”</em></p>
<p><em>“NEVER.” Fujin huffed. “HATE FOREVER.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Ow, Fujin, that’s harsh.” Seifer said and then chuckled. “We’ll see.”</em></p>
<p><em>“But what will we do?” Raijin asked.</em></p>
<p><em>“You’re  not helpless are you?” Seifer asked with a grin and with that he walked  out of their lives, backpack strung over his shoulder and Hyperion  strapped to his waist.</em></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Seifer smiled. He’d  put a request to find them. They were probably still back in Balamb,  wasting their time. They were so helpless sometimes.</p>
<p>The door opened and a girl stepped out. She looked around, confused for a moment before noticing Seifer.</p>
<p>“Oh!” She exclaimed. “I’m sorry.” Seifer looked at her, puzzled. Why was someone apologizing to him?</p>
<p>“May I help you?”</p>
<p>“Sorry.  This…this place is so big. I thought this might’ve been a stairway or  something.” She looked around. “Wow. It’s really pretty up here, isn’t  it?”</p>
<p>“Do you know who I am?” He asked, curious. She looked at him, tilting her head and scratching her chin.</p>
<p>“Hm…are you that kid in my class who always sits in the back and looks nauseous?” She inquired. Seifer laughed.</p>
<p>“You really don’t know who I am?”</p>
<p>“Why, are you someone special?” She replied cattily. He shook his head.</p>
<p>“No…no…it’s  just that it’s been a long time since I’ve met someone who didn’t hate  my guts. You’re new here, aren’t you?” He said.</p>
<p>“I just entered the academy.” She admitted.</p>
<p>“They don’t allow students to enroll at your age, do they?” He smirked.</p>
<p>“Special request. I was given permission by Cid. And I’m not that old! I’m only 16!” She retorted. Seifer simply smiled.</p>
<p>“Some of us entered before we were 10. Hell, some of us get SeeD position at your age.” She shifted uncomfortably.</p>
<p>“Well, I learned who you are. You’re someone I should avoid from now on.” She snapped.</p>
<p>“I  didn’t catch your name!” Seifer shouted. She glared at him and turned  on her heels, slamming the door. Seifer chuckled to himself and stared  at the door for a little while before looking back at the stars.</p>
<p>“16, huh…? Young.” He sighed.</p>
<p>-</p>

<p>“There  you are, Nira!” A blond girl waved viciously. Nira made her way down  the steps and sat down beside her friend to watch the end of the  concert.</p>
<p>“Sorry! I got lost. It’s a completely different place at  night! Plus I ran into some creepy blond dude. I think he was trying to  hit on me.” She sighed. Her friend cocked an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Oooo, was it that kid in class who always looks nauseous?” She asked before bursting into a giggling fit.</p>
<p>“No!  It was some weird dude with a grey trench coat and slicked back blond  hair. I mean, he was cute but he was so obnoxious.” Nira replied. The  friend blinked.</p>
<p>“Hold up, did you say ‘grey trench coat?’” She repeated.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” Her friend whispered.</p>
<p>“What? What’s wrong? Is he taken or something?”</p>
<p>“No…it’s  not that.” Her friend shifted uncomfortably in her chair and looked  down at the ground. “That’s Seifer…” Nira’s eyes widened exponentially.</p>
<p>“Wait. YOU MEAN THAT SEIFER?!!!” She demanded, standing up.</p>
<p>“No, Nira, wait!” But the girl didn’t listen. She bolted back up the steps and back towards the deck.</p>
<p>Seifer  was simply resting his eyes when he found an altogether unpleasant  burning sensation on his eye lids. When he opened his eyes, he found  that his head was up in flames.</p>
<p>“JEEZ!” He yelled, jumping to his  feet and casting a spell. No sooner did he put out the fire when a girl  flew through the air, straight at his face. He dodged easily, trying to  make sense of what was going on. When he realized who it was, he  grinned.</p>
<p>“Man, don’t like me that much after what I said to you, eh? I didn’t realize I made that much of an impression on someone.”</p>
<p>“SHUT UP YOU JERK!” She screamed, coming at him with a blizzard in hand.</p>
<p>“What’s with you?” He said, melting the blizzard with a fire.</p>
<p>“YOU  BLEW UP MY HOME! I LIVED RIGHT NEXT TO TRABIA GARDEN AND YOU BLEW IT  UP!” She yelled, tears of frustration collecting at the edges of her  eyes. Seifer hesitated and it was in that instant that she connected a  solid punch. Seifer held his ground, looking at her in shock. “YOU  KILLED MY MOTHER! YOU KILLED MY BABY BROTHER! Do you have any idea what  it’s like to be outside playing and then watch your home go up in  flames?!” She collapsed on the ground in sobs. Seifer looked down at  his hands and then back at the girl. He knelt down next to her and put  a hand on her shoulder. She pushed it away forcefully. He hung his head.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.” He whispered.</p>
<p>“Just go…go roll in a ditch and die somewhere.” She cried. <em>I wish I could…if that would make you feel better…</em>he thought sadly.</p>
<p>“Is that why you had to come here?” He asked.</p>
<p>“Shut up.” She hissed. He tried to smile, to think of something to say that would cheer her up.</p>
<p>“Well, if you never came here…you wouldn’t have met me!” He said before instantly regretting it. <em>Damned foot in mouth…</em>he thought. She glared at him and slapped him. He looked at her sadly and stood up.</p>
<p>“If  it makes you feel better…” He drew his gunblade and she shirked away,  expecting the worst. Instead, he held it out sideways, offering to her.  “Stab me.” She looked at him quizzically. “Go on, I deserve it.” She  stood up and placed her hand on the hilt of the sword. He let go and  she nearly dropped it. It was so heavy, how could anyone hold it?</p>
<p>“Wait…why?”<br />
  “Just do it if you want…if it makes you feel better.” He responded,  standing with his arms outstretched. She looked at him and then back  down at the Hyperion resting in her grasp. Visions of her mother and  little brother came to mind and with a choked scream, she plunged the  gunblade deep into his chest. Seifer coughed and gave a small cry of  pain. Nira pulled back, horrified by the blood on her hands. Seifer  collapsed on the ground, the Hyperion still embedded in his chest.  Blood poured from his mouth and he mustered as much effort as he could  to pull the sword out. When he did, the wound closed and he spat out  most of the blood.</p>
<p>“What the hell?!” Nira shouted. “What are you?!”</p>
<p>“It’s  a long story…” He gasped, standing up and staggering a little. He bent  down and picked up the gunblade again. “Here. If you want to do it  again, feel free.”</p>
<p>“YOU CAN’T DIE?!” He shushed her.</p>
<p>“Don’t  blurt that. No one’s supposed to know.” He brushed his fingers against  his chest. “Still hurts like a bitch though.” Nira covered her face.</p>
<p>“I’m imagining this…I’m imagining this…” She hissed. Seifer shook his head.</p>
<p>“Look,  you can stab me again if it’ll make you feel better. I’m sorry that I  can’t die, believe me, it would be a lot easier if I could.” He took a  step towards her, the gunblade still outstretched. She hit his hand  away and the Hyperion fell to the ground with a loud clatter.</p>
<p>“Just  leave me alone!” She ordered. He heaved another sigh and shrugged. If  she didn’t want to let her anger out, that was fine. He walked over to  his Hyperion and bent down to pick it up again when she stopped him.  “Leave it.” He looked at her quizzically.</p>
<p>“I do believe it’s mine…”</p>
<p>“Leave it. Leave it as payment for ruining my life.” She snapped, wiping her eyes. He said nothing and left.</p>
<p>As  he entered through the door, he scratched the back of his head  furiously. Even now his mistakes were haunting him. But he didn’t  understand why she needed his Hyperion. She probably didn’t know how to  use it properly, apart from stabbing and such.</p>
<p>Seifer froze in  cold blood a 30 feet away from the exit to the balcony. Without  thinking, he sprinted back and burst through the exit, only to have his  eyes widen in horror. Laying on the deck in a pool of blood was Nira.  She had somehow managed to impale herself on his Hyperion.</p>
<p>“SHIT!”  He hissed, rushing over to her. He sorted through all the spells in his  head but only came up with a cure. He prayed it would be enough until  he got her to Kadowaki. He removed the blade and quickly cast the cure  just as more blood seeped out. The bleeding slowed but kept flowing  out. He picked her up, disregarding his Hyperion and bolted down the  hallway. It was quiet in the Garden, most of the students and faculty  had gone to the concert. <em>Preferable…</em>he thought. <em>That way they won’t think of me as a murderer.</em> He shook his head. He didn’t give a damn about his reputation, he wanted the girl to live.</p>
<p>“KADOWAKI!” He yelled, breaking through the door. The doctor jumped in shock.</p>
<p>“Seifer,  what…” She stopped when she saw the unconscious girl in his arms.  “Goodness! Set her down immediately!” She ordered, jumping to her feet.  Seifer set her down on a bed.</p>
<p>“I can’t stop the bleeding!” He said frantically. Kadowaki administered a Curaga on Nira and the bleeding slowed even more.</p>
<p>“I  need you to get out of here right now!” Kadowaki snapped. “Go, go fetch  my assistant. He lives in the 4th corridor, room 112. Go, GO NOW.”  Seifer sprinted out of the room.</p>

<p>“Something wrong?” Becca asked as Xu absently stared out the window of her room. Xu jumped.</p>
<p>“I didn’t hear you knock.” She said, clutching at her chest.</p>
<p>“I  told you I would come up in a few minutes…” Becca replied, closing the  door behind them. “Well, what do you think of it so far?” Xu sighed  dreamily.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing. I mean…there’s so much I haven’t even seen yet.”</p>
<p>“I’ll  be sure to show you more of it.” She sat down next to Xu’s bed and  watched the younger girl. “Andri’s been acting like a fool since he saw  you. He hasn’t done anything he’s supposed to.” Xu blushed.</p>
<p>“Silly.”</p>
<p>“No, love-sick.” Becca replied. “What do you…” Xu stood up.</p>
<p>“I think I need a walk…” Becca stood with her.</p>
<p>“I’ll accompany you.” She said. Xu shook her head.</p>
<p>“No,  I just want to walk around alone.” She went out the door and shut it  softly behind her. Becca watched the door, hoping she would come back.  When she didn’t, the older woman flopped down on the bed and stared at  the ceiling.</p>
<p>Xu walked around the garden again, looking down at  the small flowers still trying to bloom. She sat down on one of the  stone benches and sighed.</p>
<p>“Who’s there?” Xu jumped a little and her heart sank when she saw who it was.</p>
<p>“Oh! Andri…” She said.</p>
<p>“Xu?” He turned bright red and scratched the back of his head. “How…how’s it going?” He asked nervously.</p>
<p>“It’s not bad. It could be worse I guess.” Xu replied, turning away. He sat down next to her. “How about you?”</p>
<p>“I’m doing well.”</p>
<p>“So what have you been up to these past few years?”</p>
<p>“Nothing  in particular. Becca keeps us busy but I like it. There’s always enough  time to do what you want but not too much time so that you’re bored.  She lets us go into the cities and explore but mostly we’re on this  island. I mean, it’s not bad…” Silence passed between them. “Um…how  about you?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been at the Garden. You’ve probably heard about  it in the news…but we’ve been up to a lot of things. I mean, you know,  the thing with Ultimecia, Galbadia and what not…”</p>
<p>“Yeah…” The two  sat. Andri shuffled his feet a little and toyed with the pages of his  book. “I’m glad that Becca found you…” He admitted. Xu sighed.</p>
<p>“Andri…look, I know how you feel…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Becca already told us you were off limits.” Xu’s head shot up and she stared at him.</p>
<p>“What?”<br />
  “Becca told me, well, a group of us after I saw you again that you were  off limits…that none of us could be anything more than friends with  you.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Xu demanded. Andri shrugged.</p>
<p>“She told us it would be in our best interest if we didn’t get too close to you.” <em>Does she know about Quistis?</em> Xu thought. It certainly wouldn’t surprise her. Becca had an uncanny  knowledge about everything in her life. She shook her head. No, Becca  couldn’t know…few people did.</p>
<p>“But…uh…” Andri went on, turning even redder. “Supposing…supposing that Becca hadn’t told us…”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Andri, it wouldn’t have worked out.” She said. Andri let out a sigh and smiled sadly.</p>
<p>“I thought so.”</p>
<p>“But we can still be friends?” She asked quickly. He nodded.</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Seifer  paced outside of the door, waiting for Kadowaki and her assistant to  step out and give him some news, preferably good news. When the door  did open, Seifer all but pounced on the doctor.</p>
<p>“Well?” He asked.</p>
<p>“She’s  going to be weak from the loss of blood for a good while. You have  explaining to do.” She said evenly. Seifer sighed in relief.</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>“That wound came from a blade of some sort.” She noted accusingly.</p>
<p>“She tried to kill herself with my Hyperion.” He replied. Kadowaki walked over to her desk and sat down, staring at Seifer.</p>
<p>“Continue.”</p>
<p>“I  met her just today!” He defended. “Look, I was minding my own business  when she met me. I thought she was just another student. She left after  we exchanged a few words…” He trailed off.</p>
<p>“Seifer…”</p>
<p>“I  blew up her home.” He admitted. “Back during that missiles stint of  mine, I accidentally blew up her home and killed her family. When she  found out, she tried to attack me. After she realized she couldn’t kill  me, well, she asked me to leave my Hyperion as payment. I didn’t think  too much about it so I just left it. Before I knew it, she stabbed  herself with it.” Kadowaki folded her hands on the desk.</p>
<p>“You realize that if word gets out, Squall will…”</p>
<p>“Yeah,  yeah, pubes can do what he wants. I don’t give a crap what they think  about me, not like it could really get much worse.” Seifer shrugged.  “So long as she’s ok.” Kadowaki nodded.</p>
<p>“She’ll be fine. I suggest you get some sleep yourself.” She replied.</p>
<p>“I can come visit, right?”</p>
<p>“Given what you just said, I doubt you’re the first person she wants to see.” Seifer chuckled to himself.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll be the second. You can be the first.” He replied waving and exiting.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>When  Edea found her, Adel was sleeping soundly in the garden. The older  woman smiled a little, remembering that the other orphans did the same  thing when they were younger and she would call them for dinner, only  to find them passed out in the shade. It called back memories of better  times. She and Cid never had children, she of course didn’t want to  pass the powers onto any of her children which no doubt would’ve  happened if she had given birth.</p>
<p><em>They’re all my children.</em> She thought with a smile.</p>
<p>“Adel.” She said softly, leaning over the girl. Adel stirred.</p>
<p>“Matron?” She sat up. “I mean, yes?”</p>
<p>“It’s  time for lunch.” Edea said, offering Adel a hand. The girl stood up on  her own. The older woman smiled at her stubbornness.</p>
<p>“Good, I’m  starving.” Adel replied, brushing off her back. They walked back  towards the orphanage. Some White SeeD were already seated, waiting for  Edea. Most of the building had been completed and only a small portion  of the back had yet to be rebuilt. Cid smiled when he saw the two enter  the room.</p>
<p>“Ah good, I was wondering how long you were going to  make these young boys wait.” He said. As soon as the two sat down, the  White SeeD dug into their meals with fervor. Edea looked at Cid warmly  but noticed a slightly distant look in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Dear…” She whispered. He blinked and his eyes cleared.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Is something wrong?” She asked. Cid shook his head.</p>
<p>“No, everything’s fine.” Edea lowered her eyelids.</p>
<p>“Darling, I can read you like a book. There’s something on your mind.” She said. Cid chuckled a little.</p>
<p>“You  can indeed.” He sighed. “I was just thinking…it’s just a trivial matter  anyway but as tiring as it was, I miss the raucous and the students of  the Garden. I was wondering how they were doing.” Edea smiled.</p>
<p>“I was wondering the same.” The White SeeD glanced from Edea to Cid and back. Finally, one of them spoke up.</p>
<p>“We could take you there…it wouldn’t be hard to do.”</p>
<p>“It’s  too much trouble.” Edea replied. “It’s quite alright, I’m sure that the  Garden is holding up just fine under the younger generation’s watch.  It’s time we let that go.” Cid nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“Yes…but I  would like to check up on them…” Edea too wanted to see how her  children were holding up but she didn’t want to interfere with whatever  it was they were doing. Their appearance, especially since they needed  to bring Adel with them, would no doubt cause some extra distraction to  whatever it was they were doing.</p>
<p>“We’ll discuss this later, dear.” Edea replied. “Now eat before your lunch gets cold.”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Seifer  approached the bridge, flanked by two SeeD who had somehow managed to  fight their way through the Training Center where Seifer had tried to  ditch them. Angry, bruised and cut up, they glared at the man they were  supposed to protect and Seifer could feel the chill of their hatred  even when he wasn’t looking at them. Nida noticed them out of the  corner of his eye and turned around.</p>
<p>“Hello, Seifer…” He said cautiously. “What brings you to the bridge?”</p>
<p>“I thought I would visit you of course.” He smirked, clapping the pilot on the arm. Nida brushed his hand away.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Nida asked.</p>
<p>“I was wondering if I could put in a request to go to Balamb…” He replied. Nida looked at him coldly.</p>
<p>“Why? So you can terrorize the residents there some more?” Seifer laughed.</p>
<p>“No, just looking for some old friends.” He answered. Nida shook his head.</p>
<p>“I can’t do that, Seifer. I need clearance. You need to get permission from Squall or Cid.”</p>
<p>“You can’t bend the rules for me?” Seifer batted his eyelashes and Nida shuddered, looking away.</p>
<p>“Just get him out of here.” He commanded. The two SeeD seized Seifer’s arms but he shrugged them off.</p>
<p>“Fine,  I’ll have a talk with pubes, see what he thinks.” He said before  marching to the elevator and closing the door before the two SeeD could  catch up.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Squall looked over all the documents he  had to approve before sending them off. He hated all the paper work. It  wouldn't be long before he found someone to take over. He didn't really  like the temporary position he had as commander. The battle had been  won and he deserved a break.</p>
<p>“Squall?” Rinoa entered the room  softly. He grunted in response. She walked on over to him and put her  arms around him. “What's wrong, baby?”</p>
<p>“I need sleep.” He sighed, reclining back on the chair. She kissed him atop his head and smiled.</p>
<p>“How about you take a small break?” She suggested.</p>
<p>“Sounds  like a good idea.” He replied, getting up. Just as he was about to exit  the room, the door opened, narrowly missing his face. Seifer stormed  through the door.</p>
<p>“Hey, pubes.” Seifer said.</p>
<p>“What do you want Seifer?” Squall snapped, taking a step back.</p>
<p>“What say we stop by Balamb?” Seifer suggested.</p>
<p>“Why?” Squall replied.</p>
<p>“I'm  sick of the cafeteria food. I want to eat Mrs. Dincht's home cooking!”  Seifer said, grinning. Squall narrowed his eyes. “Look, I want to head  back there because I want to see if Raijin and Fujin are still there  and Nida won't do it without your instruction.” Squall hesitated a  moment before shrugging.</p>
<p>“Fine.” The sudden approval took Seifer aback.</p>
<p>“What?” He said.</p>
<p>“You  heard me. I'll call it into Nida right now.” Squall walked over to the  phone and picked it up, dialing to the bridge. “Nida, it's Squall. I  give full permission to go to Balamb. Yeah, no, I'm sure. Yes, Seifer  did talk to me, yes I'm still sure. Right.” Squall hung up. A moment  later, Nida's voice came over the P.A.</p>
<p><em>Attention all students  and faculty, the Garden will be headed for Balamb tomorrow. Please make  sure to gather here before then. I repeat, the Garden will be heading  to Balamb tomorrow.</em></p>
<p>Seifer looked at Squall with a puzzled  expression. Squall and Rinoa walked out of the office without saying  another word. Once they were out of earshot, Rinoa tugged on Squall's  sleeve.</p>
<p>“Um...what was that?” She asked. Squall shrugged again.</p>
<p>“Look, I know Balamb's not going to be very happy with him returning but the way I figure, it'll be best.”</p>
<p>“I'm not sure I follow.” Rinoa replied skeptically.</p>
<p>“If  he manages to find Fujin and Raijin, we won't have to waste our time  protecting him so much. Fujin and Raijin are better body guards than we  could ever manage and he'll probably keep them by his side at all times  which is saying much more than now.” Squall explained nodding to the  fact that the two SeeD he had assigned to Seifer looking quizzically  around trying to locate their lost subject. Rinoa smiled.</p>
<p>“And here I thought you were being nice to Seifer for once.” At hearing this, Squall scoffed and went on his way.</p>
<p>-</p>

<p>Xu  walked through the mansion, admiring the architecture. Whoever designed  the house had talent. It was all decidedly modern and the material  must've cost a fortune. She got so caught up in observing the mansion  that in the next moment, she found herself wandering into Becca's study.</p>
<p>At  first she didn't realize where she was but it wasn't long before she  spotted many, many pictures of Becca and other people on the walls.  Most of them were of her at some small town posing with Dr. Cradus.  They were often with a research team standing next to weapons she  recognized from suits of armor to giant attack robots. She gazed up at  how Becca changed through the years. In the earlier photos, she looked  gangly and awkward but as the years wore on, she matured.</p>
<p>“Xu?” Xu jumped when she heard the voice.</p>
<p>“Bejeez!” Xu exclaimed, clutching her chest.</p>
<p>“You lost?” Becca asked, closing the door behind her.</p>
<p>“Yeah,  I guess I'm still getting used to this house.” Becca sat down in her  large chair and opened up a drawer, pulling out a pen. “I'm sorry...are  you working?”</p>
<p>“No, no.” Becca reassured. “I'm just finishing up  really. Dinner's going to start soon. Andri's cooking, he's a fine  cook. Never really had the aptitude for anything else though.”</p>
<p>“Do you think I have time for a nap? I'm exhausted.” Xu asked. Becca looked at the clock on her desk and nodded.</p>
<p>“I'll  wake you when dinner's ready.” She replied. Xu walked over to the door  and peeked out, then looked back at Becca sheepishly.</p>
<p>“Um...”</p>
<p>“Go  down the hall, take a left, second door on your right and up the  stairs.” Becca said with a smile. Xu bowed her head and went on her  way. When she reached her room, she collapsed, not even bothering to  crawl under the sheets and she dreamt.</p>
<p><em>She stood in the  garden, taking in all the scents, sights and sounds. She could hear  footsteps coming up behind her and she smiled, knowing full well who it  was. A pair of arms encircled her waist and softly kissed her on the  cheek. She turned around.</em></p>
<p><em>“Hey.” She said, breaking out into a grin.</em></p>
<p><em>“Hey.”</em></p>
<p><em>Xu leaned in and kissed Becca on the lips.</em></p>
