Fujin shuffled restlessly in the back seat of the battered hover-car. 
The wide seats where leather and stuck to her skin annoyingly. The funky 
smell that permeated the car was even worse in the back. She noted with 
more than a little dismay she smelled far worse. It had been nearly a 
week since she last had a bath. Excluding the impromptu one she got on 
the rail tracks leading into the badlands. She got as comfortable as she 
could, she had arrived in Esthar sometime near midnight. As soon as she 
did she found a out of the way alley to park in. Regardless of her 
trials she intended to get some measure of sleep. Finally she drifted 
off.

The next morning there was a rapping on the roof of the car.

She awoke sourly, smacking her lips in disgust. Her mouth felt and 
tasted like she&#146;d been eating gym socks. Groggy sitting up, she stared 
out the broken window. Her vision obscured by the tangled mess of her 
hair. A rotund and severe looking fellow stared expectantly at her. He 
was in a silvery blue uniform and seemed in a hurry. An officer she 
assumed.

&quot;GO AWAY.&quot; She said bleakly then laid back down.

&quot;Get this heap out of the alley lady or I will have it towed and toss 
you in a cell.&quot;

&quot;WHY?&quot; She grunted in annoyance and sat back up rubbing her face.

&quot;Your in the way of service vehicles. Now move it!&quot; He rapped the roof 
again with his stun stick. She gave him a look that would have killed 
lesser men. He was not impressed and opened the back door.

&quot;Don&#146;t make me drag you out of there.&quot; He said bluntly.

&quot;FINE!&quot; She shouted in aggravation as she slid out of the car.

&quot;Don&#146;t yell at me again miss!&quot; He said deliberately, eyes glinting.

She ruffled her hair and squinted up at him. It was early morning by the 
looks of it. She glanced up, buildings went up as far as she could see 
on either side her. Thin rays of light reflecting off their mirrored 
windows. With a sigh she walked to the front passenger door and climbed 
in. Her jacket was in the way so she grabbed to move it. She felt the 
hard roundness of the skull laying under it. She glanced back at the 
officer, who was growing impatient. She assumed he did not to need to 
see some dead guys skull in her front seat, so she left the jacket where 
it was. She wiggled behind the wheel and started the engine. It buckled 
and shuttered loudly the backfired to a stop. She prayed it had little 
more life in it and tried again. A gout of black smoke roiled from the 
back and the craft lifted off the ground. The officer walked to driver 
window and looked her.

&quot;Your about to crack the head there miss. If I were you I&#146;d scrap it. 
Car in this shape, it&#146;s better to put it out it&#146;s misery. I&#146;d keep off 
the high altitude paths too, looks like your safety glider is shot.&quot; He 
nodded to a small red light on the dash. &quot;Hate for you to crash from 
there.&quot;

&quot;THANKS.&quot; She blurted as she pulled away from him.

She was soon puttering along on the lower paths. This was low town, far 
below the high high-rise&#146;s and skyways. Ground level, the poor and the 
shady lived down here. Every gem has a rough spot she noted. She needed 
a change of clothes and bath. She looked for a shop and soon found a 
small military surplus store. Good enough, she decided and parked. Her 
car sputtered and knocked loudly even as she got out.

&quot;At least it got me here.&quot; She mused, thanking her lucky stars as she 
limped across the street.

She tried the door and felt lucky that the place was open this early. 
She walked inside quietly and looked around. The haze of years of dust 
hung in the air and the smell of cigars tickled her nose. The place was 
a large open room, littered with shelves and clothes racks. Old military 
weapons hung on the wall dusty and dull with age. The clothing, typical 
to the type where dull green and brown camouflage. Jackets, pants, 
shorts, jackets, boots and just about every other article of clothing 
one could expect. The shelves where adorned with everything from gas 
masks to camouflage thongs. She nearly giggled at the thought.

&quot;Can I help you gal?&quot; A gruff voice sounded. She turned startled. A dark 
skinned man with tiger striped tattoo&#146;s down the left side of his face 
eyed her.

&quot;LOOKING.&quot; She muttered and began thumbing through the shirts. He was 
staring at her darkly, she noted she was still in a sports bra and 
shorts.

&quot;Let me know if you need anything.&quot; He walked away and took a seat 
behind the counter then grabbed a gray remote. He clicked a button and 
an ancient TV mounted on the opposite wall lit up.

She took a black tank top and folded it over her arm, it was soon joined 
by a pair of black swat pants, they would be baggy but they would fit 
her well enough. She finished her shopping by nabbing a camo sports bra 
and one of those accursed thongs, she hated it but she needed to change 
her clothes bad. She walked up to the counter and deposited her stuff.

The man smirked at her as her rang the stuff up.

&quot;You homeless?&quot; He said idly.

&quot;NO.&quot; She looked at him cautiously. Trying to read his intentions.

&quot;I aint out to get you, so just calm down. You just look homeless is 
all.&quot;

&quot;NO CONCERN.&quot; She barked.

The man held his hands up. &quot;Hey back off lady just trying to help. Got a 
bathroom in the back if you want to freshen up. You um....&quot; He rubbed 
his nose and smirked

She scowled at him darkly and turned to leave.

&quot;Aw common kid don&#146;t be like that. Look, I help the orphans around here 
get off the streets. Honestly, go clean up and I&#146;ll get us some grub.&quot; 
He walked out from behind the counter and offered his giant hand.

&quot;Names Aegis.&quot; He smiled broadly. Fujin looked at his hand suspiciously 
then back up at him. She tentatively shook his hand.

&quot;FUJIN.&quot;

&quot;Intense lil thing aren&#146;t ya.&quot; He grinned and laughed aloud, a thick 
throaty laugh she could feel in her chest.

&quot;Bathrooms in the back, I&#146;ll lock the door while I am out. Um don&#146;t 
steal nothing from me Nicodemous hates thieves.&quot; He motion to doorway 
with a curtain draped over it.

&quot;Not that you would, right?&quot; He eyed her dangerously then laughed again. 
&quot;I&#146;ll be back soon.&quot;

He headed out the door and locked it behind him. Fujin stood for a long 
moment. She should feel very uncomfortable but nothing about the man 
seemed dangerous. She walked behind the counter and took her new 
clothes. She noticed several black and white photos dotted the back 
wall, most of them where of children and young teens. Aegis himself was 
in some of them.

She crept into the back room past the curtain. She was on guard 
regardless what her intuition told her. She was no slouch in combat but 
was not about to make foolish risks in completely trusting a stranger. 
Heavy snoring greeted her ears. It came from around near corner at the 
end of the hall. She tip toed carefully and peeked around it. There in 
the floor was apparently a dog, but it bigger than any she had seen. The 
thing was obviously a monster of sorts and if standing would be nearly 
as tall as her. The beast opened one eye lazily to regard her, beyond it 
was the bathroom and another door probably leading to Aegis&#146;s room. The 
beast huffed at her once then went back to sleep. She slipped past it, 
and into the bathroom and shut the door.

She scanned the room quickly for peepholes and hidden cameras, feeling 
silly when she found nothing amiss.

&quot;Paranoid.&quot; She thought, as she peeled out of her old clothing. She 
looked in the small mirror and sighed. She looked like death itself, she 
was sunburned again, though no where near like before. Her hair was an 
untamed thing that enveloped her head. A dark ring hung under eye making 
her look well beyond her years. She touched the scar covering her 
permanently closed eye. She hated him and no longer feared him. She 
remembered and understood everything and she accepted it. She would not 
let him have power over her anymore. She would not run anymore, and face 
what life put in her path.

&quot;What next for me then?&quot; She wondered to herself. She had no idea and 
sighed once more. She saw a toothbrush still in the box sitting near the 
sink. Nabbing it instantly she tore it open making a mental note to pay 
Aegis for it when he came back. She grabbed the toothpaste and set off 
to vanquish the dragon that had take roost in her mouth.

**********************

Quistis sat at her desk peacefully. She wore a simple white sun dress 
and shades. As the students filed in they each deposited a card on her 
desk and wished her happy birthday. She thanked them each warmly. She 
noticed the treppies where not here yet, she assumed they where up to 
mischief and grinned. As if on cue Rinoa and Nicole slid into the room 
both dressed in pink mog suits. Each wore a top hat, and carried a cane. 
They winked at each other and started tap dancing madly. Quistis sat in 
dumbfounded silence.

The two girls danced around each other moment, then bowed with a 
sweeping gesture to the door. Selphie and Royce now entered, the two of 
them dressed like chocobo&#146;s, and like the others, also carrying top hat 
and cane. The two groups met face to face, staring intently as if sizing 
each other up. Abruptly a comical sounding country ditty echoed through 
the room. Then all four began to square dance. The class clapped to the 
beat as Quistis watched with a bright eyed grin.

The music settled in a jazzy pop beat and the quartet stopped. One after 
another they swept an arm towards the door and Aeka entered the room. 
She was dressed in a sickeningly sweet Sunday dress complete with giant 
bow on back. Her hair was pigtails and tied with brightly colored 
ribbons. She held a cordless microphone and she waved cutely to Quistis. 
She stood before the clownish group a moment, getting in rhythm with the 
music. Then started an adorably jazzy rendition of happy birthday. She 
skipped around the classroom merrily, mog&#146;s and chocobo&#146;s bouncing 
behind her. She got getting the other students to join her song. Quistis 
clapped and laughed brightly as the group danced by each blowing her a 
kiss. Finally Aeka returned to where she started and finished the song 
with soulful flare. As she did so Irvine and Zell danced into the room 
dressed like clowns. The class exploded into laughter. Quistis&#146;s eyes 
grew wide.

Irvine had a monstrous mass of balloons in each hand. He strode to the 
center of the room and let them go, they quickly bobbled across the 
ceiling, several popped and rained confetti everywhere. He walked to her 
and kissed her cheek. He then went to join the others. Zell tottered 
uneasily towards her, he carried a huge tower cake with a little child 
like Quistis atop it. He looked as if he would drop it, instead he spun 
in a tight circle while holding it aloft with one hand. Then without so 
much as a spilled crumb he spiraled low and settled it gentle on her 
desk. He too then kissed her cheek before back flipping to the others. 
The room applauded in approval. Quistis leaned back in her chair 
laughing.

Rinoa stood scowling and gesturing in the doorway, she stamped her foot 
then whistled sharply. Immediately was a loud series of barking and a 
shout of surprise. Everyone looked worried towards the door. Squall 
suddenly skidded in the room with Rinoa&#146;s dog Angelo hot on his heels. 
He too was dressed like a clown and held in his had a monstrous array of 
roses, which he now used to swat at the pursuing canine. He ran amid the 
desk as Angelo tried feverishly to bite him in the rear. Students 
scattered out of their path in shock.

Quistis fell out of her chair laughing. Satisfied, Rinoa whistled, 
Angelo stopped with out a second thought and went directly to her side. 
Squall found himself standing atop one of the desks. All eyes where on 
him and looked as if he would explode. Instead he let out a sigh and 
rolled his eyes. He deftly hopped off the table and walked towards 
Quistis, who was just now getting back in her seat.

She noted he accepted his fate, offering a faint smile he handed her the 
roses.

&quot;Happy birthday Quisty.&quot; He whispered with a wink and faint smirk, 
before giving her an awkward peck on the cheek.

Quistis was simply shocked silent.

After everything calmed a bit Cid and Edea entered the room. Cid waved 
cheerily to everyone as Edea stood behind him. He turned and regarded 
Quistis.

&quot;Happy birthday, on behalf of the entire staff.&quot; He clapped vigorously, 
the entire room quickly joining him. Quistis sat in warm silence and for 
a moment she forgot the beast that sat in dark depths of her mind. 
Smiling warmly she stood, and Edea moved forward meet her.

&quot;Now my dear.&quot; She waved a hand, causing the candles on the cake burst 
into flames.

&quot;Time to make a wish. Who knows it may come true.&quot; She added the last 
part in a whisper and gave a decidedly unsettling smile. Quistis choose 
not to ponder it, she leaned towards the towering cake. She had no 
dreams left in her anymore she realized they&#146;d all turned to dust. That 
was not true she admitted she hoped all her friends would live long and 
happy lives after....

She fought back the thought, not wanting to spoil her mood. This was a 
time to be with friends and be thankful for all they have done. She took 
a deep breath, held it a moment then exhaled sharply. The candles tried 
their best to resist her, but one by one they expired.

Everyone cheered once more. Quistis stepped back and put her hands on 
her hips. She regarded the congregation with a smirk.

&quot;Thanks everyone for the beautiful party.&quot; She looked at Selphie and 
Rinoa sarcastically. &quot;No stripper this time. You girls must be loosing 
your touch.&quot; The two girls giggled each other. Zell leapt forward, 
tugging at his orange polyester pants.

&quot;Well I can cover that Ma&#146;am&quot; He shouted laughingly.

Nicole stepped forward and grabbed him by the ear. She wagged a finger 
at him as she pulled him back.

&quot;Kidding! Kidding!&quot; He screamed and winced childishly. Everyone laughed 
anew.

Aeka ran forward and hugged Quistis tightly. She returned the embrace 
then nodded to the cake.

&quot;Okay folks time to cut the cake. Surely you don&#146;t think I could handle 
this myself.&quot; She said brightly.

Irvine and Nicole brought in plates and silverware and began passing 
them out. Squall and Selphie where right behind them hauling coolers of 
soda.

********************

Fujin sat in the shower far longer than she needed. She stood still, 
absently watching the water spiral down the drain. She savored the 
warmth of the water rolling down her body. She was tired, sore, hungry 
and emotionally drained. She had discovered a lot about herself during 
her journey. She contemplated going back to Balamb. She did not know 
what would become of her if she did, but she did know what would if she 
didn&#146;t. That thought stirred her and she shivered despite the warm rush 
of the water.

A soft knock on the door caught her attention. She turned off the water 
and grabbed a towel.

&quot;YES?&quot; A twinge of agitation crept in her.

&quot;I&#146;m back.&quot; It was Aegis. &quot;You okay in there? Your foods getting cold.&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Affirmative?&quot; He mumbled curiously then shook his head with a chuckle. 
&quot;Okay then, come out when you&#146;re ready then.&quot; He stepped over the giant 
hound in the hall and went back out front.

She dried herself off and looked in the mirror. She still looked 
frazzled and beat but at least she was clean. She quickly got dressed 
and opened the door. Nicodemus stood at head level and looked her in the 
eye. The great hounds black fur had a dull shine and its squinty eyes 
glowed like crimson embers. The thing beast looked like it crawled from 
hell it even had back swept horns. She froze, cautiously returning its 
gaze as its nostrils flared.

She started scooting around it slowly. The beast snorted loudly and 
huffed. Her stomach heaved from the stench of it&#146;s breath. She thing 
followed her up the hall.

She quickly rushed through the curtain and into the front room. Aegis 
was settled back in a battered and hole riddled recliner. He was 
devouring a large breakfast croissandwich and laughing at cartoons on 
the TV.

&quot;Ah there you are.&quot; He said with a grin and nodded to a paper bag and 
cup on the counter. &quot;There&#146;s your breakfast. Didn&#146;t know what you would 
like so I got you some sausage biscuits and scrambled eggs.&quot;

&quot;THANKS.&quot; She said as politely as she could and handed him her bankcard. 
He raised a confused brow at her.

&quot;What&#146;s that for?&quot; He said around a mouthful of food.

&quot;TOOTHBRUSH, FOOD.&quot;

He nearly choked trying not to laugh. The girl had a quirkiness about 
her he found refreshing. He set his food down and waved her hand away.

&quot;Put that away for something important.&quot; He settled back in his chair 
and continued eating.

She shrugged and put the card back in her pocket. She turned and grabbed 
the bag from the counter and fished inside. She pulled out a sausage 
biscuit and hoped up on the counter.

The cartoon on the TV was simple but amusing, it reminded her of Raijin. 
She missed the lummox. Aegis glanced towards her curiously.

&quot;So where ya from kid?&quot;

She hated being called a kid but she weathered it.

&quot;BALAMB.&quot;

&quot;Never heard of it.&quot; He said with a shrug. &quot;Is it on the mainland?&quot;

&quot;DEPENDS.&quot;

&quot;Huh, what do you mean?&quot;

&quot;MOVES.&quot;

&quot;Your hometown moves.&quot;

&quot;FLIES&quot;

&quot;Un huh, that&#146;s interesting. So what brings you out here?&quot;

She hated talking, it was such a effort.

&quot;WANDER.&quot;

&quot;A drifter eh, you a run away?&quot;

She did not know how to answer that and simply took a bite of her 
biscuit.

&quot;It&#146;s cool if you don&#146;t want to talk about it.&quot; He said peaceable before 
resuming his meal. They sat together quietly, watching cartoons and 
eating breakfast.

After eating he cleaned up the trash and sat back in his seat. The bell 
over the front door jingled, a trio of young teens came in. Aegis 
noticed them but sat where he was. Nicodemus clomped out from the back, 
he rested his head on the counter to watch the shoppers. Fujin carefully 
hopped off the counter and found her crutch. One of group, a lanky boy 
with greasy black hair looked her and smirked. He then elbowed his 
friend and pointed at her. The friend, another lanky lad with a mass of 
gold piercings in his face looked up. He blinked in surprise then 
laughed in her direction.

&quot;Whoa check her out! She&#146;s one of them albino things, cool.&quot; He blurted 
stupidly, he was obviously fried from some drug. The first boy smacked 
him atop the head and gestured at her.

&quot;They ain&#146;t things man! Don&#146;t you know nothin they is people too, just 
funny looking.&quot;

The third boy from their group looked up from his browsing. He wore dark 
shades and peered over them at her with a bored expression.

&quot;I dunno she looks pretty hot to me Norris.&quot; He whistled at her. Fujin 
took it in stride and leaned back on the counter. Aegis watched her 
intently then looked at the trio.

&quot;Want me to put em out?&quot; He asked bluntly.

She shook her head and went back to watching the TV. She was to busy 
pondering her next plan of action to bother with those idiots.

The boy came to the register with several canteens and a pair of black 
leather boots. The boy the facial jewelry leaned on the counter and 
regarded her.

&quot;Heya love. Haven&#146;t seen you here about? You new to the low lands?&quot; He 
asked with a greasy charm. Fujin flat out ignored him.

&quot;She&#146;s dissin you Cervante.&quot; The other boys snickered and mocked him.

The boy, the one called Cervante soured and cleared his throat.

&quot;Ahem.&quot; He tapped her on the shoulder and looked back to his friends 
with a grin. Aegis sat watching quietly. Fujin turned slowly and locked 
her crimson gaze on him. Her expression was cold and dangerous. The man 
balked and stared at her for a moment.

&quot;Eh...Not the talkitive type huh....I can dig it.&quot; The boy shrugged and 
turned back to his friends who ribbed him mercilessly. Without further 
hassle, the group then jostled each other out the door.

&quot;Sorry about that.&quot; Aegis said, scratching his short goatee.

Fujin shrugged quietly, a distant glaze to her eyes.

&quot;So what now?&quot;

She turned to him and frowned.

&quot;HOME.&quot; She said with a waver.

&quot;Is that bad?&quot;

She slumped visibly and sighed.

&quot;You have anyone to go home to, Friends, Family?&quot;

&quot;UNCLEAR.&quot;

Her mannerisms was throwing him for a loop. He was sorely tempted to ask 
what the deal was, but decided would not be a good idea.
&quot;Your not sure?&quot;

&quot;CORRECT.&quot; She was weary, of everything.

&quot;You plan to find out I assume?&quot;

&quot;UNDECIDED.&quot;

&quot;Right....&quot; He choose not to push her anymore about it. He stood and 
shoved his hands in his pockets, then nodded towards her ankle.

&quot;Sprain or Break?&quot;

&quot;FRACTURE.&quot; She said dully.

&quot;I have a potion or two if you want em. Not much but can heal that a bit 
for you.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; She looked at him gratefully. &quot;NOT IMPORTANT.&quot;

&quot;Okay then. Well feel free to hangout as long as you need to. I have a 
spare room in the back if you want to use it for awhile. Though you have 
to help out around the shop in return. No free rides here.&quot; He grinned 
hugely. She gave him a rare smirk then shook her head.

&quot;MUST GO.&quot; She walked to him and offered her hand.

&quot;Understood. Well girl if ya ever need a hand give me a holler.&quot; He took 
her small hand in his and shook it firmly.

&quot;THANK YOU.&quot; She bowed politely. He nodded in return.

&quot;Take care of yourself Fujin.&quot; He pointed warily at her with a gleam in 
his eye.

She nodded stoically then headed for the door. He watched her leave and 
waited for a long moment. Nicodemus clomped up to his side and leaned 
against him. Aegis scratched the beast behind the horns and grinned.

&quot;Strange gal.&quot; He muttered to himself, then sat back down.

******************************

The party was over and all but Quistis and the students remained. It was 
quickly approaching noon and everyone was straightening up. Quistis 
smoothed her dress out and fixed her hair before addressing the class.

&quot;Okay everyone listen up. Cid&#146;s cleared us for a seven-hour shore leave, 
so go clean up and meet me at the front entrance. Bring some money in 
case you want to pick up something along the way. Oh and thanks again 
for the lovely party. Your all the best.&quot; She winked at them warmly.

Rinoa came up and looked at her worriedly. &quot;Archibald and Luccian 
haven&#146;t been to class in a few days...&quot; Quistis had to fight not to show 
annoyance. She clearly recalled how Rinoa and the two troublemakers had 
left her tending children.

&quot;Xu&#146;s taking care of that.&quot; She said with only a tinge of venom in her 
voice.

&quot;I just assumed after yesterday they&#146;d come back. They acted normal 
while we worked on the screens.&quot; Rinoa asked with genuine curiosity.

&quot;Xu&#146;s got it.&quot; Quistis said with a firm finality. She grabbed her bag 
and strode out the door with out another word. Rinoa looked hurt and 
sighed worriedly.

A quick stop at her apartment to drop off her bag and Quistis was on her 
way. She tried to keep her mind clear and devoid of the emotions within 
her. Now was not the time for regrets or second thoughts. She hurried up 
the hall and into the elevator. Archibald was waiting for her. She stood 
in the door a moment and eyed him suspiciously.

&quot;Miss Trepe.&quot; He said blandly.

&quot;Archie..&quot; She stepped into the elevator.

&quot;You leaving for town?&quot;

&quot;Yes I am. Will you be joining us?&quot;

&quot;Nope.&quot; The door closed.

&quot;You know your welcome to join us. Just because Luccian got himself in 
trouble and is missing classes doesn&#146;t mean you have to.&quot; She regarded 
him with a tinge of worry. He was a nice enough kid but easily swayed to 
do stupid things. Especially when someone like Luccian was around to 
lead him by the nose.

&quot;No thanks.&quot; He said, not even looking at her.

&quot;I saw you two helping Rinoa the other day. I was wondering where he 
made off to?&quot;

&quot;He&#146;s been around.&quot; He folded his arms and wondered why she as pestering 
him.

&quot;Well at least he still feels at home enough to help out in a crisis.&quot;

&quot;Who cares.&quot;

Quistis cocked her hip and pointed at him in annoyance.

&quot;Listen Archie I don&#146;t know what poison he&#146;s been feeding you but you&#146;re 
a nice kid with a bright future. Don&#146;t let someone like him drag you 
down to his level. You honestly don&#146;t want to be like him do you? &quot;

&quot;You finished?&quot; He gave her an icy look.

&quot;What happened to you? You used to be stronger than this.&quot; She looked 
pleadingly at him.

&quot;Ask yourself the same thing lady. You used to be someone I respected 
but now, you&#146;re just a wash up. You think anyone takes you serious 
anymore.&quot; He said sharply. Quistis balked and took a step back.

She stammered in shock but went silent. He arched a brow at her and then 
leaned back against the wall.

&quot;Thought as much.&quot; He said smugly then continued. &quot;Look Miss Trepe I 
don&#146;t need you to tell me how to live my life. Luccian and me are like 
brothers. He has his problems, sure, but we stick together. You have a 
problem with him you have one with me. So don&#146;t try and turn me against 
him. &quot;

She was tired of fighting, tired of everything.

&quot;Okay then.&quot; She looked away from him and sighed softly.

Archibald looked at her from the corner of his eye. She looked so much 
older in that moment. Her shoulders hung loose and her face was solemn 
and tired looking. Her eyes startled him most, usually they where 
vibrant crystal blue and sharp as nails. Now they where sullen and dark, 
she looked like his father did when he died all those years ago. He was 
only six then and his mother had killed herself two years earlier. He 
didn&#146;t remember her much, but his father he remembered all to well. 
After his mom died he watched helpless as his father drift farther and 
farther away. Until one morning he was just gone. Archibald remembered 
finding him sitting in the living room, his tired brown eyes wide open 
but devoid of life. Archibald felt a chill that made him shiver, he 
found himself speaking.

&quot;Miss Trepe.&quot; He said quietly.

Quistis glanced at him dully.

&quot;Thanks for trying to help.&quot; He had no idea what to say. &quot;I&#146;ll come 
along I suppose. Want me to see if Luccian wants to go?&quot;

&quot;If you want.&quot; She replied as the elevator stopped. Archibald hurried 
out the door wanting to put some distance between him and the woman. 
He&#146;d felt something terrible about her and wanted no part of it.

&quot;Yeah I&#146;ll do that then.&quot; He offered weirdly as the door shut.

Quistis didn&#146;t even notice when she finally arrived at her destination. 
She stood quietly in the elevator lost in dark, desperate thoughts. With 
an audible ding the doors began to close again. She blinked and looked 
up, she shoved her hand between the doors then squeezed between them.

She stepped out into the main hall of Balamb Garden. It was just past 
noon and she had to hurry. Putting on a mask of tranquillity she headed 
towards the parking garage.

The Treppie&#146;s where all accounted for, as was several other students. 
She smiled at them brightly as she approached.

&quot;Okay class, We will be heading out in just a few minutes.&quot; She fished 
about in her purse then pulled out a set of keys.

&quot;Royce. Your driving, we&#146;ll be taking the Sutur V.&quot; She tossed the keys 
to him.

&quot;Yes!&quot; Royce shouted gleefully as he snatched the keys out of the air. 
The Sutur V was a behemoth all terrain vehicle. Made for troop 
transport, it was a no nonsense, powerful and state of the art vehicle. 
Royce all but ran to the black and gold ATV. Aeka scampered right behind 
him. Quistis grinned and looked to the others.

&quot;We&#146;ll wait a few more moments for the others to get here.&quot;

Royce pulled the Sutur V around to them, the rumble of it engine 
drumming loudly. He poked his head out from the window grinning ear to 
ear.

&quot;I love this!&quot; He beamed brightly. Aeka peeked out over his shoulder.

&quot;Miss Quistis, how long can we stay in town.?&quot; She asked excitedly.

&quot;In town Curfew is 7PM, as always.&quot; Quistis grinned fondly at the now 
sulking girl.

&quot;Aw poo.&quot; Aeka mumbled cutely and pulled her head back in.

Royce smirked at her as he pulled some dark shades out and donned them.

&quot;Oh I&#146;m the man.&quot; He mouthed cheekily as he revved the engine.

&quot;Royce, show a modicum of self restraint please.&quot; Quistis said with 
playful sternness.

&quot;Sorry Ma&#146;am&quot; He sank into the seat sheepishly.

&quot;Don&#146;t leave without us!&quot; Rinoa yelled as she came running around the 
corner. Five other students where right on her heels. Quistis turned 
towards her and smirked.

&quot;Tardy Miss Heartilly? That&#146;s not like you.&quot; She said slyly.

Rinoa stuck her lip out at her.

&quot;Squall was still griping about me forcing him into that clown outfit.&quot; 
Rinoa grinned as she climbed aboard the transport.

&quot;How on earth did you manage that by the way.&quot; Quistis asked curiously.

&quot;It&#146;s amazing what you can do when you put your mind to it.&quot; Rinoa said 
with a saucy smile.

&quot;Oh spare me.&quot; Quistis rolled her eyes. &quot;Find a seat we&#146;ll be leaving 
soon.&quot;

&quot;Lordy this is some beast.&quot; Rinoa marveled, making her way to one of the 
many wide leather seats.

Quistis made a mental count of her class. Everyone was present now 
except Luccian and Archibald.

Assuming they where no shows she climbed into the front passenger seat 
of the transport.

&quot;Okay Royce lets move out.&quot; She said while buckling her seat belt.

There was a heavy thud and the transport rocked slightly.

&quot;What was that?&quot; Royce looked up.

&quot;Something landed on us.&quot; Quistis said, rolling down the window she 
peeked out. Luccian&#146;s head appeared suddenly as he leaned over the edge 
of the roof. &quot;Hiya Teach!&quot; He grinned like a shark at her. Quistis 
pulled her head in startled. He flipped off the roof and landed by the 
passenger door. He leaned in the window and smiled at everyone.

&quot;Surely you guys aren&#146;t leaving without me are you?&quot; He said 
dangerously. Royce had the urge to run him over. Quistis leaned towards 
Luccian with a slight scowl.

&quot;If you behave yourself your more than welcome to come aboard.&quot; She said 
simply and hit the switch to raise the window. Luccian had to move 
quickly to keep his head from getting stuck.

Rinoa opened the hatch to let him in. He strode in cockily with 
Archibald right behind him.

&quot;Hey princess&quot; He said cattily a he got in her face. After their little 
truce yesterday Rinoa hoped to be on better terms with the boy. However, 
things where back to normal apparently. She looked him in the eye 
unflinching. &quot;No hello&#146;s? You wound me.&quot; He sighed loudly and bowed 
contemptuously. &quot;So be it my dear lady.&quot; He pushed past her and moved to 
the back of the transport to find a seat. Archibald just nodded at her 
as he passed. Rinoa returned the gesture and shut the door.

Luccian plopped heavily into the seat next to Aeka. She scooted over and 
scowled at him darkly.

&quot;Wassup kid.&quot; He said cutely and winked at her. She hated him more than 
anyone else.

&quot;Don&#146;t talk to me you pompous ass.&quot; She grumbled and looked out the 
window. Archibald having took the seat across from them both laughed at 
the exchange. Luccian glared at him dangerously causing him to shut up.

&quot;Listen up.&quot; Luccian hissed quietly as he leaned towards the girl. &quot;I&#146;m 
going places, you treat me nice and I&#146;ll return the favor.&quot;

&quot;Oh Ick.&quot; Aeka rolled her eyes and looked at him incredulously. 
Luccian&#146;s expression soured and promptly sat back in his seat.

&quot;You know what Arch?&quot; He said calmly.

&quot;What&#146;s that?&quot; Archibald replied impassively.

&quot;People don&#146;t give me the respect I deserve.&quot; He said it with a playful 
smirk but there was a glint in his eyes that spoke of something darker. 
Aeka ignored the both of them and went back to looking out the window.

&quot;Nope.&quot; Archibald said in agreement.

&quot;I&#146;ll have to do something about that.&quot; He said, putting his hands 
behind his head.

&quot;Yup.&quot;

Royce pulled out of the parking lot and was soon trudging down the 
access ramp leading outside. Quistis sat quietly her mind wandering 
about as her class chatted idly among themselves.

*****************

Stuck in the middle of the roadway, Fujin fidgeted with a assortment of 
cables and wires under the hood of her hover-car. Several cars honked 
loudly as they whipped past her. She ignored them and worked feverishly 
to get the engine running again. Luckily nothing had burst yet but 
several cables where just to corroded and dry rotted to do much good 
anymore. She climbed back in and sat behind the driver seat she let her 
head fall against the wheel. She finally sat back and tried the keys 
once more. A tortured whine and the sound of metal grinding assaulted 
her. She winced as the engine belched loudly then rumbled to life. She 
increased the power and the craft shuttered forward. The ride was rough 
and loud but she was on her way.

She could clearly see Balamb as it hovered over Esthars High town. It 
should have been easy enough to get there. She was tempted to risk the 
flying to the upper levels and be done with it. Luckily a large section 
of the car undercarriage fell away, causing her to file the idea under 
suicidal. As it was it cost her the better part of two hours and three 
breakdowns to transverse the back roads and ramps leading to ritzy part 
of town. She felt a slight twinge of trepidation at the thought of 
returning to the Garden. She had no idea what to expect upon returning. 
She could only hope things would be better. She&#146;d done a lot of soul 
searching during her short exodus and found in herself a strength she 
had only pretended to have. There was a lot still missing though. She 
had come to realize she no longer needed Seifer or her brother. However 
she did need something to fill that void.

In a burst of inspiration she knew what she would do. She would finish 
her classes and become a SEED. She only needed a few more credits before 
she could take her final exam.

&quot;That&#146;s assuming Cid lets me return to my studies. I don&#146;t even know if 
I can return to Balamb yet.&quot; She thought glumly.

She noticed a sign in a store window that made her hit the brakes. The 
jarring caused the car to go dead and it fell hard to the road. The 
shock absorbers screeched in protest at the impact but held. Fujin 
cursed inwardly and restarted the engine. With much fuss and hassle she 
coaxed the craft to the side of the road and got out. Grabbing her 
crutch she hurried to the store. She stood before the window and a smile 
crept to her lips as she read the sign.

Delilah&#146;s Wines and Spirits

Offering the Highest Quality

Wines, Champagnes, And Spirits

Including Rare, And Vintage Selections.

The sound of bells jingling greeted her ears as she opened the door. The 
interior smelled of perfume and flowers. Classical music played faintly 
on speakers giving the store an air of sophistication. She walked in 
almost timidly. She felt out of place in a classy establishment like 
this. She was nearly afraid she&#146;d break something.

&quot;May I help you.&quot; A tall slender woman said with air of haughtiness. She 
was in her late fifties by the look of it. Fujin, Playing it by ear 
walked to the counter where the woman was.

&quot;CHAMPAGNE.&quot; She blurted. The woman jerked in surprise.

&quot;Pardon!?&quot;

Fujin sighed and closed her eyes.

&quot;LOOKING.&quot; She said as softly as she could.

&quot;I see.&quot; The woman pursed her lips and looked at her acidly &quot;Miss this 
is not a store for vagabonds and drunks.&quot;

Fujin nearly tackled her.

&quot;NOT DRUNK.&quot; She said instead.

&quot;Well then, what can I help you with.&quot; The woman said with obvious 
contempt.

Fujin, to her credit remained calm and collected. She was not about to 
let this woman get to her.

&quot;VINTAGE.&quot;

&quot;Oh really, what year and make.&quot; The woman chirped sarcastically

&quot;WINTER FESTIVAL.&quot;

&quot;The ones sold last year?&quot;

Fujin nodded briskly.

&quot;What brand? There where several being sold.&quot; The woman was being more 
polite now that she realized Fujin was actually looking for something in 
particular.

Fujin struggled to remember the brand name. It came to her and she 
grimly realized she had no hope in pronouncing it. She decided to give 
it a shot anyway.

&quot;SEEN VAR...SHEEN....VIR.....&quot; She closed her eye in and hissed a 
profanity. She cursed her failings. The woman sat nonplussed then handed 
her a pen and paper.

&quot;Here write it if you can.&quot; Her voice was tinged with pity now, Fujin 
hated her even more for it.

Fujin snatched the pen and scribbled the name down. The clerk took the 
paper and read it aloud.

&quot;Sean&#146;Vere San Pas&#146;?&quot; She arched a brow, impressed. &quot;A good champagne 
very expensive.&quot;

Fujin frowned inwardly, she hadn&#146;t considered the price.

&quot;HAVE?&quot;

&quot;Let me look.&quot; The woman slid a thick ringed binder from a near shelf 
and thumbed through it.

Fujin took the time to look around and think. Where would she get the 
money for something like this? She had little money in her account and 
nothing of any value, except..

The clerk called her to the counter. Fujin ran her hands through her 
hair in exasperation then walked over.

&quot;Okay, you&#146;re in luck.&quot; The clerk said with a smile. &quot;Sean&#146;Vere San Pas&#146; 
I have one remaining at the cost of eighty-three thirty-five. Fujin&#146;s 
eye nearly popped from its socket. She had lest than half that in her 
account. She tapped her teeth with her fingertip in though. The woman 
regarded her questioningly.

&quot;Will you take it?&quot; She asked simply.

&quot;RETURN.&quot; Fujin stated, then headed out the door. She knew how she could 
get some money. The clerk watched her go, a perplexed expression on her 
face.

*******************************

The trip did not go exactly as planned. By the time Royce parked the ATV 
the class erupted into arguments as to what to see first. Quistis gave 
in and let them split up, with the condition they stay out trouble. Only 
Aeka and Royce stayed by her side, Together they explored the various 
shops and caf&eacute;s. Within a few short hours Royce had gathered a 
respectable pile of books and software.

Quistis noticed with a soft grin that Aeka was all to eagerly to help 
him carry it all. She hung back a few steps to give them space. Aeka 
seemed happy enough, Quistis guessed that she had a good chance of 
snagging Royce. They would compliment each other well, assuming Royce 
even got a clue. The boy was smart as hell but was oblivious to things 
right in his face. She fought back a chuckle and looked about. She loved 
coming here, it was a beautiful city. The sounds of horns blaring caught 
her attention. Looking up the road she saw a woman in the distance. Her 
vehicle broke down by the looks of it. She also seemed to be beating the 
hell out of it with a stick. Thick smoke billowed from the engine 
obscuring Quistis&#146;s vision. For a moment she thought the woman was Fujin 
and her heart leapt to her throat.

&quot;You&#146;re imagining things.&quot; She told herself.

Aeka grabbed her by the arm.

&quot;Miss Trepe!?&quot; She said excitedly. Quistis took a moment longer to try 
to see through the smoke before looking down at the girl.

&quot;What is it Aeka?&quot; She asked, slightly flustered.

Aeka pointed up a large series of steps, Royce stood at the top of the 
steps with a grin on his face.

Quistis regarded the two of them.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s a theater.&quot; Aeka said brightly.

Quistis glanced back towards the smoldering vehicle the woman was gone. 
She wrinkled her nose and looked back to Aeka.

&quot;Let&#146;s go see what the fuss is about.&quot; She said with faint annoyance in 
her voice.

Aeka beamed brightly and clapped her hands together. She reminded 
Quistis of Selphie except without the mischievous streak. She followed 
her up the steps to meet Royce who was gesturing madly at a poster.

&quot;Oh Hyne what is it now.&quot; Quistis grinned at him and looked at the 
poster. Her jaw dropped in shock.

&quot;That&#146;s me? I mean us? My hairs not Red?? She stammered.

Aeka looked closer and giggled in shock.

&quot;Oh dear that&#146;s not good.&quot; The poster was a painting Quistis, Squall and 
the others. Apparently there was a play of sorts inside, dealing with 
the confrontation of Ultimecia and Adel.

The painter had taken liberties with the piece or just had no viable 
references.

&quot;Why is Rinoa in thong and hugging on Squall&#146;s leg like that.&quot; Aeka 
asked innocently.

Quistis felt ill, Squall was bare chest and had a wild mane of hair 
blowing behind him. Zell sported biker leathers and a Mohawk, his entire 
head covered in tattoos. Irvine was in a black coat and had twin machine 
guns, the black hair and goatee made him nearly unrecognizable. The 
worse part though was the rendition of she and the other girls. Rinoa 
indeed was in a thong and little else, she was clutching Squall&#146;s leg 
and looked frightened. Selphie meanwhile was in a dangerously short 
miniskirt and leather halter-top in. Quistis herself was in an 
aggressive looking black leather getup with stiletto heels and a corset. 
Her hair was red and pulled back into a tight ponytail.

Quistis stood quietly a long moment staring at the picture.

Royce and Aeka looked at each other worried.

&quot;I think we should go Miss Trepe.&quot; Royce said. Quistis just pointed at 
the picture and made indigent noises.

&quot;I think I figured out what kind of play this is.&quot; Aeka said pointedly.

**************************************

Fujin was furious; the hover-car finally died a horrible death and left 
her stranded in the middle of traffic. She nearly broke her crutch in a 
fit of anger as she wailed it against the roof of the car. She frowned 
down at the skull that fell to the floorboard as she got her jacket. The 
skull stared silently at her, she hoped whoever found him next would put 
him to rest.

Ridiculously she actually felt a twinge of sorrow for leaving the car, 
especially since it probably saved her life. She patted the roof almost 
affectionately then made her way across the street. At least High town 
had shuttles to ferry people about. She found a stop and waited for the 
next one. An elderly crone looking woman came up to stand beside her.

Fujin glanced at her impassively. The woman caught her looking and 
abruptly turned on her.

&quot;Do I know you!&quot; She snapped.

Fujin blinked, somewhat taken aback.

&quot;Well!&quot;

&quot;NO.&quot; Fujin offered.

&quot;What do you want?&quot;

Fujin made a face and ignored her.

&quot;Your one of them ain&#146;t ya!&quot; The woman jabbed a gnarled finger at her. 
Fujin looked at her as if she where insane.

&quot;DESIST.&quot; She snarled angrily as the woman poked her again.

&quot;I&#146;m up to your tricks demon.&quot; The crone cackled and jabbed her again.

&quot;MANIAC!?&quot; Fujin shouted and quickly moved away from the deranged woman. 
The hag tried to hobble after her but was unable to keep up.

&quot;Aha you fear me demon! Face me!&quot; The woman shouted and gestured madly 
in her direction. Fujin ducked into a quite coffeehouse nearby to wait 
for the shuttle-bus.

The hostess greeted her with a warm smile.

&quot;Can I help you?&quot; The young woman asked.

Fujin thought a moment then regarded the girl hopefully.

&quot;CLEANER?&quot; Fujin asked hopefully.

&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot; The woman looked confused.

&quot;DRY CLEANER.&quot; Fujin elaborated.

&quot;I don&#146;t follow you miss. You&#146;re not from her are you?&quot; The hostess said 
apologetically.

&quot;Great she thinks I speak another language.&quot; Fujin thought as she buried 
her face in her hand. Exasperated, she looked up at the girl and tried 
again.

&quot;LOOKING FOR.&quot; She said evenly, her throat was getting sore. The woman 
nodded like she was trying to understand a child&#146;s babbling.

&quot;Oh ummm? This.. Coffee... Place...&quot; The girl said in a wide-eyed 
attempt to bridge the language barrier.

&quot;KNOW.. COFFEE!&quot; Fujin barked causing the woman to jump in fright. Fujin 
calmed down and held up her dingy dress coat.

&quot;NEED CLEANER.&quot; She tried once more. The hostess&#146;s eyes lit up with 
understanding.

&quot;Oh you&#146;re looking for a dry cleaner!&quot; She said merrily. Fujin nodded 
with sarcastic enthusiasm.

&quot;The nearest one on Isis Boulevard, about five blocks down. That shuttle 
is heading that way.&quot; The girl said as she pointed out the window. 
Fujin&#146;s head snapped around to see shuttle she&#146;d been waiting on 
preparing to leave.

Cursing loudly she rushed outside as fast her wounded ankle allowed.

She caught the shuttle as it was taking off and banged on the door with 
her crutch. The door creaked open and the driver glared at her.

&quot;Hurry up!&quot; He snapped. Fujin pulled herself aboard and looked for a 
seat.

The old lady who&#146;d pestered her earlier sat in the back screaming 
incoherently at her. Fujin took a deep breath as she found an isle seat.

***********************

Quistis sat on the steps of the Esthar Museum of Sciences and History. 
She waited patiently for Royce and Aeka, who&#146;d went inside to see the 
exhibits. She welcomed the peace in quite, it was growing increasingly 
hard for her to keep up pretenses. She would be happy when this day was 
over. She was tired of hiding the pain that had destroyed her heart. The 
disappointments, loneliness and self-loathing had done their work. She 
was tired of being the strong one everyone called upon on. Always being 
what others needed her to be but never having the chance to discover who 
she really was.

It was almost over though she thought darkly. With a heavy heart she 
slowly stood. The wind was picking up and it blew her hair about. 
Looking to the sky she saw dark clouds slowly gathering.

&quot;Fitting.&quot; She thought gloomily as she walked up to the museum&#146;s 
entrance. A tall slender gentleman in a crisp uniform greeted her with a 
smile and opened the door.

&quot;Thanks but I&#146;m not going in. I was wondering if you could pass a 
message for me?&quot; Quistis asked.

&quot;Of course Ma&#146;am.&quot; The man said with a stern nod. &quot;To whom?&quot;

&quot;A young man and woman. She&#146;s short with shoulder length black hair. 
He&#146;s tall and will have a bunch of bags with him.&quot;

&quot;What&#146;s the message?&quot;

&quot;Tell them I&#146;ve went for a walk and not to forget to meet at the 
transport by seven.&quot;

&quot;Will do.&quot; The man said with a nod.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Quistis gave him a smile then walked back down the steps.

***************************

Fujin had found the dry cleaner she was searching for. She now waited 
patiently as they cleaned her jacket. She&#146;d come up with the idea for 
selling it and using the money to buy the champagne she was after. 
Having it cleaned and pressed was prudent if she was to have any hope of 
getting a good price out of it. A small voice in the back of her mind 
yelled at her about the foolishness of such an endeavor. She had earned 
that jacket through hard work and years of training.

Ever since arriving at Balamb garden she&#146;d tried her best to overcome 
her weakness. She threw herself into the martial arts to strengthen her 
body and mind. Having no social life to speak of she had more than 
enough time to learn various hand to hand and weapons styles. She was 
proud of her accomplishments but knew she still had far to go. Seifer 
actually taught her several things on the cliff all those years ago. 
First never fully trust anyone, you leave yourself open for 
disappointment and attack. Second it showed she was still weak and 
vulnerable. She used her anger and turned it into something productive. 
From that point on she pushed herself past the breaking point and nearly 
to destruction. Back then she felt she had nothing to loose so she put 
all of herself into every challenge.

Then came the War God trials, a martial arts tournament held between the 
various gardens. They came only every four years. She signed up, she 
decided two things would either happen. She&#146;d either prove to herself 
she had surpassed her weaknesses or she would die. For her it was more a 
trial of spirit than a test of her abilities. She used to tournament to 
expel her daemons and thoughts of self-hatred. Being small and a female 
she was not expected to place well. Everyone was surprised when she made 
it to the final battle.

The last fight was against a brutal opponent from Galbania. Zell, 
arguable the best martial artist in Balamb had fought him earlier and 
was soundly defeated. She was the only one left to face him. The battle 
was long and horrible. He battered her, broke her and then defeated her. 
Or so he thought, until she stood to face him again. He attacked once 
more, this time beating her savagely until she fell. This time he was 
certain of victory and went to claim his prize. Yet she forced herself 
to her feet to challenge him again. He angrily screamed at her to stay 
down. Yet she stood her ground, she faced him without fear. For what is 
fear to one whom was willing to die.

He attacked yet again, pleading with her to accept defeat. He was nearly 
in tears at what he was doing to her. Fujin would not relent, and he 
realized he would have to kill her to win. He didn&#146;t have it in him and 
he fell to his knees in defeat. She stood over him beyond caring about 
the tournament or much of anything else at that point. She had seen a 
dark and frightening part of herself. She had accomplished her goal, 
she&#146;d proven her strength of will and body. But she lost a part of her 
self in doing so. What was left of the bright-eyed girl of her youth had 
died in that arena.

They gave her a trophy and the jacket as a prize but later abolished the 
tournament.

Sadly she realized after Rajin&#146;s and Seifer&#146;s disappearance. The 
frightened girl was not dead but buried alive somewhere under the wall 
of stone she had built around herself. Quistis had somehow touched that 
part of her. At first Fujin was afraid of what could happen, but after 
much soul searching she wanted to find out. Quistis had treated her like 
someone special and she meant to repay her.

The service bell rang and she looked up. Her coat hung on a hook waiting 
for her by the register.

Without a word Fujin used her last bit of funding to pay the clerk and 
carefully took the coat in hand. She looked up at the sky, she had to 
hurry it was getting late. She had to find someone to buy the Jacket and 
she could only think of one person, Aegis.

To her chagrin none of the shuttles went to low town, brace the grace of 
Hyne she found a Samaritan willing to drive her back to Aegis&#146;s shop. 
After thanking the driver she hurried inside the shop. Aegis was busily 
putting out several rows of military boots when she entered. He turned 
in surprise and grinned at her.

&quot;Welcome back gal.&quot; He noticed her fidgeting. &quot; You look bent out of 
shape what&#146;s the rush?&quot;

She held up the Jacket. He let out a whistle and nodded approvingly.

&quot;Is that what I think it is?&quot; He said noting the symbol on the metal 
shoulder piece of the jacket.

&quot;WAR GOD&quot; She said flatly.

&quot;I heard of it. Some kind of military event overseas, a best of the best 
competition I believe.&quot;

Fujin nodded.

&quot;Where&#146;d you get it?&quot; He asked with a hint of suspicion.

&quot;EARNED.&quot; She replied with somewhat haunted expression.

&quot;Uh huh.&quot; He did not wish to argue with her.

His expression showed that he didn&#146;t believe her. She felt no need to 
prove anything and ignored his accusing glance.

&quot;PURCHASE?&quot; She asked evenly.

&quot;That&#146;s a rare piece lady. You sure you want to part with it.&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot; She shoved the jacket at him.

&quot;Calm down, what&#146;s the rush.&quot; He took the jacket and inspected it.

It was made for someone of her stature, that much was sure. He looked at 
her again, this time sizing her up. He was not about to buy stolen 
goods. She was in shape that much was obvious and she carried herself 
like someone who could fight, even if she was banged up and scruffy 
looking. Something about her still made him want to give her the benefit 
of a doubt.

&quot;Alright kid, you have a deal. How much?&quot;

&quot;HUNDRED.&quot;

Aegis looked shocked and looked at her as if she was crazy.

&quot;That&#146;s all? The quality alone is worth more than that.&quot; He really would 
hate to take advantage of her like that.

&quot;TWO.&quot; She didn&#146;t care and was pressed for time.

&quot;Two hundred it is.&quot; Aegis agreed. Seeing how frantic she was becoming. 
He took her bankcard and went to the register. He made the transaction 
and wired the money into her account. He returned with her the card and 
a receipt.

&quot;There you go.&quot;

She took her card and made for the door.

&quot;You seem in a hurry?&quot; Aegis said nonplused

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;You know, I could give you a ride if you don&#146;t have one.&quot;

She looked at him sourly, she could swear he was making light of her 
situation.

&quot;PLEASE.&quot; She huffed and softened her expression.

&quot;That&#146;s what I was waiting for.&quot; He said with a grin as he grabbed his 
keys from the counter.

&quot;Nic. watch the place while I&#146;m gone.&quot; He shouted to the monstrous hound 
sleeping on the floor. The beast opened one eye momentarily then rolled 
over.

Aegis led Fujin outside to a sporty sky-cycle. It was a sleek and flashy 
craft, built for speed and agility. He climbed aboard and motioned her 
to hop on behind him.

&quot;IMPRESSIVE.&quot; She stated as she hopped aboard.

&quot;Thanks, it&#146;s a gift from a kid I helped out of this hell hole.&quot; Aegis 
grinned proudly. &quot;He&#146;s a senator now.&quot; Aegis hit the engine and the 
cycle roared to life.

&quot;Where are we going?&quot; He shouted over the engine.

&quot;DELILAH&#146;S.&quot;

&quot;Where is that at??&quot;

&quot;HIGH TOWN.&quot; Fujin replied pointing upwards.

&quot;Got ya. Hold on!&quot; He hit the gas and the craft launched forward then 
upward at a step angle. Fujin grinned as they streaked amid the 
buildings at a dazzling speed. She thoroughly enjoyed the breeze in her 
hair and the thrill of the ride. She was slowly working her way into a 
downright chipper mood. She thought of Quistis and smiled inwardly.

****************************************

Luccian strode up the street like a man possessed. He rudely elbowed 
past anyone in his path and was working himself into frenzy. Archibald 
followed him obediently but trying to get some answers. The young 
behemoth had to jog to keep up with his quick-footed companion.

&quot;Lou man where&#146;re going? This place sucks man and it smells. You drag me 
all the way down to these slums for what reason?&quot; He complained.

&quot;Shut up I&#146;m still pissed at you.&quot; Luccian snarled as he trudged on.

&quot;Me? What the hell for?&quot; Archibald looked surprised by this.

&quot;Training with that asshole.&quot;

&quot;What, who Dincht? What the heck brought that up?&quot;

Luccian spun around and pointed at him.

&quot;I&#146;m the only trainer you need got that!&quot; He hissed.

&quot;Hey I was only trying to get some new moves. After that throw down with 
that crazy chick, I figured you was getting rusty.&quot;

Luccian shoved him.

&quot;She got lucky that&#146;s all there is to it!&quot; He snarled.

&quot;Twice.&quot; Archibald mumbled under his breath.

&quot;I heard that, ass!&quot; Luccian turned and continued walking. &quot;Don&#146;t you 
worry about. Where we&#146;re going we&#146;ll learn everything we need.&quot;

Archibald frowned in thought.

&quot;I hear the wheels turning but I ain&#146;t following you.&quot; He said, 
confused.

Luccian looked over his shoulder.

&quot;Just hurry up and quit bitchin.&quot; Luccian said sourly. He slipped a bent 
and wrinkled magazine out of his coat and looked at it. It was an old 
issue of Combat Kings, on the cover was a demonic looking warrior. The 
words &quot;Tyrannous! Legend or Real?&quot; where printed in dark letters under 
it. He thumbed through it as he walked.

&quot;What&#146;s that?&quot; Archibald inquired nosily. Luccian tapped a finger on a 
picture of old shoddy store with a stern looking old man standing out 
front.

&quot;This guys gonna give us some information.&quot; Luccian said with a grin.

&quot;You drag me out here to see some clinchy looking old turd. That guy 
looks like he&#146;s over a hundred, he&#146;s prolly rotting by now.&quot; Archibald 
groaned in disgust. Luccian was not the least bit pleased with his 
companions&#146; lack of respect. He had gotten more and more flippant 
recently and Luccian was tired of it. He grabbed Archibald by the throat 
and snarled.

&quot;That clinchy looking old turd has information on what I need! Things 
are going to change and I will have the respect I deserve.&quot; He squeezed 
tighter and Archibald tried to pry his hands away.

&quot;You, my friend, are being far to candid of late and I&#146;m sick of your 
whining and bitching.&quot; He let him go and shoved him backwards. Archibald 
fell on his rear with a loud grunt. He glared up at Luccian in shock.

&quot;YOU CRAZY?&quot; He shouted as he rubbed his throat.

&quot;Are you done.&quot; Luccian said with a dark look.

&quot;Yeah I guess so.&quot; Archibald replied quietly and stood.

&quot;Good now come on!&quot; Luccian turned and continue up the sidewalk, his 
coat billowing behind him like the cloak of some deranged king.

********************************

Fujin and Aegis arrived at their destination with time to spare. Fujin 
slid off the bike as soon as it stopped.

She bowed politely to Aegis.

&quot;GRATITUDE.&quot; She said sincerely. He assumed she meant that as a thank 
you.

&quot;No problem I had to pick up some things up here anyway. So what&#146;s so 
important about this place?&quot; He asked while looking the store over.

&quot;GIFT.&quot; Fujin replied. Aegis nodded and grinned.

&quot;Fine wine eh. Who&#146;s the lucky fella?&quot; He ribbed playfully. Fujin looked 
slightly troubled at the thought. The sky suddenly darkened, drawing 
their attentions skyward. Clouds of an impending storm where slowly 
building overhead.

&quot;Ah hell its gonna rain.&quot; Aegis said with a frown. &quot;Where else you 
heading, perhaps we can beat the storm?&quot;

She shook her head and shared a rare smile.

&quot;NO NEED.&quot; She pointed towards Balamb hovering a few blocks away.

&quot;What&#146;s that thing have to do with it?&quot;

&quot;HOME.&quot; She clapped him on the shoulder thankfully.

&quot;Well your just full of surprises aren&#146;t you.&quot; Aegis said slightly 
stunned. &quot;Okay then I&#146;m gonna run my errands and get back home before 
the storm. You sure you&#146;ll be okay?&quot;

Fujin nodded and gestured for him to go. He revved the engine and looked 
at her sternly.

&quot;You come visit me. Oh and good luck with the date or whatever.&quot; He said 
with a wink before taking off. Fujin gave him a sour look but waved 
goodbye.

Aegis was a good guy she told herself. She&#146;d be sure to visit him when 
she could. She watched him disappear among the buildings and crowd 
before going inside the shop. Fujin approached the counter and stood 
expectantly. The shopkeeper glanced up at her blinked.

&quot;You&#146;re back?&quot; The woman said with a hint of surprise

Fujin nodded and slipped her bankcard from her pocket.

&quot;I suppose you&#146;re wanting the champagne we discussed?&quot;

Fujin nodded then spoke up.

&quot;COOLER.&quot; She pointed to a row of small carrying cases along the wall.

&quot;Okay then and one cooler.&quot; The woman said dryly as she went into the 
back rooms.

Fujin went to front window and gazed outside as she waited.

Quistis walked by, Fujin nearly had a fit and ducked out of sight. She 
was shocked at how startled she was. She crept back to the window and 
looked out. Sure enough it was Quistis, she was standing at the corner 
waiting for the light to turn. Fujin felt her heart flutter in chest and 
she exhaled. She moved to the door and stopped as two youths ran up to 
join Quistis.

&quot;DAMN.&quot; She muttered under her breath.

&quot;Miss.&quot; The clerk has returned with her items. Fujin turned and hurried 
to her.

&quot;That will be....&quot; The woman started but Fujin cut her off by tossing 
the bankcard at her. The clerk eyed her severely as she ran the card 
through the register.

&quot;There you go...&quot; The woman started again, Fujin also again, cut her off 
by snatching back her card and scooping up the cooler with her 
champagne. With out another word Fujin scurried out the door.

Her mind recalled vividly dreams and strange thoughts she&#146;d been having. 
Seeing Quistis here and now brought them back in a flood. She breathed 
unsteadily she was frightened by the emotions she was having. Quistis 
and her companions started to move across the street. Fujin followed at 
a discrete distance trying to learn why they where here. After several 
minutes she realized the two strangers where students, apparently on 
some field trip. She&#146;d also overheard an interesting tidbit. It was 
Quistis&#146;s birthday. This made her ponder the champagne she carried. Her 
attempt at replacing the one spilled that fateful night in Quistis&#146;s 
apartment had now turned into an impromptu birthday gift. Fujin smirked 
at her luck though she wished she could do something more. She really 
had no idea what to expect when next they&#146;d meet.

As she tagged along behind them she began to notice something unsettling 
about the way Quistis was carrying herself. She was smiling and joking 
with her friends but there was a dark aura about her. Something was 
wrong here and she planned to find out what.

Quistis, Royce and Aeka soon arrived at the transport. Rinoa and several 
other students where already waiting patiently. Quistis greet everyone 
as Royce and Aeka their bags into a cargo bin.

&quot;You guys have fun?&quot; Rinoa asked merrily.

&quot;A bit.&quot; Quistis replied. &quot;My feet hurt from all the walking around.&quot;

&quot;Aha see one your older and your already feeling it.&quot; Rinoa teased.

&quot;That&#146;s nice.&quot; Quistis said sourly and took a roll call to see who was 
still missing. Rinoa shrank back and went to her seat quietly.

The sun was nearly down and it was getting dark. Quistis looked at her 
watch, 6:45PM. No one noticed a slender figure slip quietly into one of 
the large cargo bins.

Fujin was careful to jam the lock of the bin so she wouldn&#146;t be trapped 
inside. She got comfortable and waited. She had no desire to encounter 
anyone just yet. There would be to many questions and she wanted time to 
see Quistis alone first. She heard Quistis talking about Luccian and why 
he wasn&#146;t here yet. Fujin sighed in annoyance at the very thought of 
him. Now that she had time to take a breath her ankle decided to 
complain loudly to her. The break had been partially healed by her last 
healing spell but was still very tender. Hobbling about all day on it 
didn&#146;t help it any, she winced and massaged it gently. She was worried 
about Quistis she did not know how but she could all but sense something 
horribly wrong with her. She heard the sound of rain starting to hit the 
metal shell of the transport. She was thankful she was under cover for 
once.

7:16PM, Quistis looked up from her watch annoyed. They missed curfew and 
it was Luccian&#146;s and Archibald&#146;s fault, everyone else was here. She 
regretted letting them come along.

&quot;Lets go.&quot; Quistis said dully.

&quot;Yes ma&#146;am.&quot; Royce turned on the lights and saw two figures jump out of 
shuttle bus and run towards them. &quot;Here they come Miss Trepe.&quot; He said 
with a hint of disappointment.

One of the students opened the hatch to let them in. Archibald came in 
fist dripping water everywhere. He looked sheepishly towards Quistis 
expecting a biblical tirade. To his surprise she said nothing and looked 
like she could care less. Luccian came in next. His sleek black hair 
hanging in his face. He did not say or look at anyone, he only went to 
the back of the transport to sit down. In his hands he held a black and 
brown lacquer case the size of large book.

***************************

It was a good deal later by the time they arrived at the gates of Balamb 
Garden. The ramp was pulled up and garage closed tight. A guard walked 
up to the window and shined his light inside.

&quot;What can I do for you people.&quot; He said warily. Quistis recognized the 
boy from last year&#146;s class. She leaned over Royce to speak with him.

&quot;It&#146;s just me and my class Scott. We had transport problems so where 
running late.&quot; She said.

&quot;Oh hey Miss Trepe. You know regulations about curfew Ma&#146;am, gotta 
report it to the head of the night shift.&quot; He said apologetically. Royce 
was wondering why Quistis lied about them being late. He assumed it was 
to try to hurry along and not with helping Luccian. He looked over his 
shoulder at the other students who where sitting quietly. Aeka smiled at 
him cutely, he smirked and winked at her. Aeka&#146;s heart did flip-flops in 
her chest.

Fujin could barely hear the conversation going on but it looked like 
they would be sitting here awhile.

&quot;Great, all I need is to be found like a stowaway.&quot; She thought.

Quistis didn&#146;t try to pursue talking the guard out of it. She just sat 
back in her seat and waited for whoever was on duty tonight. She was 
only mildly surprised when Xu came through the gate.

*********************************

The students where dismissed long ago and had went to their rooms. 
Quistis meanwhile spent the next two hours filling out paperwork in the 
guardhouse with the Xu and the Security guard. Detailing the rules and 
regulations of field trips and curfews. All the while Xu chided her 
relentlessly and explained that it was stuff like this, that&#146;d got her 
license pulled to began with.

Quistis took in all in stride and not once showed any semblance of 
anger.

When it was all said and done Xu told her to report to Cid in the 
morning about Disciplinary actions. Xu then left up the hall and the 
guard went back to his post outside. Quistis stood in the darkened 
garage and sighed.

&quot;It&#146;s time I guess.&quot; She whispered sadly. She went to the transport to 
get her things and locked the doors. As she was leaving she noticed one 
of the cargo bins was left open. She kicked it shut and left the garage.

She walked quietly among the halls of the garden. Passing by each of her 
friends rooms she paused a moment to lay her head against their doors. 
She quietly wished them well and moved onward. She wandered for over an 
hour, visiting her favorite places and spending a few minutes there in 
quiet reflection. Finally she found herself in the uppermost level of 
Balamb Garden. Standing before a simple metal door that said &quot;Roof 
Access.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re stalling.&quot; The beast whispered in the desolate depths of her 
mind.

&quot;No I&#146;m not.&quot; She thought, then opened the door. Warm rain fell over her 
as she stepped out on the gently curving expanse of Balamb&#146;s roof. She 
was bathed in iridescent lights of the magical rotating rings that held 
Balamb aloft.

&quot;I&#146;m afraid.&quot; She thought curiously.

&quot;Don&#146;t be, there&#146;s nothing for you here anymore.&quot; The beast said 
soothingly.

&quot;I&#146;m just so tired.&quot; Quistis said quietly as tears filled her eyes.

&quot;I know, but you can rest now.&quot; The darkness called her.

She walked to the very edge of the roof and peered down. The rings spun 
below her crackling with power. The chime like noise they emitted echoed 
peacefully around her.

&quot;It&#146;s beautiful.&quot; She whispered hauntingly.

&quot;Spread your arms and fly, fly away from the pain, the loneliness. Leave 
it all behind you. You&#146;ve earned your peace.&quot; The thoughts caressed her 
like a lover. The beast was right all along, even though she&#146;d tried to 
fight it, to deny it. Now in the end, she finally realized, one couldn&#146;t 
fight one&#146;s self.

Tears came freely as she threw her head back and closed her eyes. A 
quiet moment went by and finally as the hopelessness claimed her she 
spread her arms.... </pre>
