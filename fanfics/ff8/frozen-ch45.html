&quot;FEEL RETARDED.&quot; Fujin grumbled irritably.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, nice slippers by the way.&quot; Xu chuckled.

&quot;SHUT UP.&quot; Fujin snapped, shuffling her Mog covered feet awkwardly.

&quot;Ladies please.&quot; Quistis sighed and knocked on the door.

The door opened wide and Rinoa greeted them with a wide smile.

&quot;Quistis hi, oh wow and Xu. This is the first time I&#39;ve seen you outside 
of class.&quot; Rinoa smirked in shock.

&quot;Yeah well I tend to keep busy.&quot; Xu shrugged. &quot;Someone decided I needed 
to come to your little shindig.&quot; She said playfully while cutting 
Quistis an accusing glance.

&quot;The more the merrier, come on in!&quot;

Xu walked in first and saw Aeka and Nicole mulling about the kitchen. 
Celest sat in the middle of the floor amid a pile of videotapes.

&quot;Quite the full house eh?&quot; Xu laughed.

Quistis and Fujin entered next. Fujin noticed Rinoa&#39;s blatant disregard 
of her presence but remained silent. She&#39;d be far more content if none 
of them said anything to her.

&quot;Where&#39;s? Selphie?&quot; Quistis asked looking around.

&quot;She&#39;s not here yet.&quot; Rinoa said with a shrug and went to join Celest in 
sorting through the tapes. Xu gave a smirk to Fujin and Quistis before 
following Rinoa..

&quot;BAD IDEA.&quot; Fujin mumbled, looking around awkwardly.

&quot;I told you silly, you didn&#39;t have to come.&quot; Quistis said as she headed 
to the kitchen to see Nicole.

&quot;BETTER TO TRY.&quot; Fujin admitted glumly.

&quot;If you get to uncomfortable just leave.&quot;

&quot;UPSETTING?&quot; Fujin frowned.

&quot;I won&#39;t be upset, I promise.&quot; Quistis chuckled then grabbed Nicole in a 
hug.

&quot;There&#39;s the birthday girl! How are ya feeling hon?&quot; She said warmly.

&quot;Hi Quisty, I&#39;m okay, I guess.&quot; Nicole said with a forced smile.

&quot;Miss Fujin!&quot; Aeka said in surprise. &quot;Wow I never thought you&#39;d be 
here!?&quot;

&quot;ME EITHER.&quot; Fujin said wryly.

&quot;Thanks Fujin.&quot; Nicole smiled apologetically. &quot;I said some mean things 
last I saw you. I just wanted to say I&#39;m sorry. I just hope we can all 
try to get along.&quot;

Fujin looked at her with a cold look of indifference. Slowly she grinned 
slightly and nodded.

&quot;ACCEPTED, APOLOGIZE ALSO.&quot; She said firmly then walked back towards the 
living room.

&quot;So peculiar.&quot; Nicole smirked and looked inquisitively to Quistis. &quot;Why 
does she, um talk like that.&quot;

Aeka looked up at Quistis curiously waiting for an answer.

&quot;A defect in her vocal cords makes them weak, she can only talk in short 
bursts before it gets painful.&quot; Quistis explained quietly.

&quot;That&#146;s sad.&quot; Aeka frowned.

&quot;I never knew that, I thought she was just weird.&quot; Nicole said 
thoughtfully.

&quot;Not at all.&quot; Quistis smiled.

&quot;There&#39;s not going to be any fighting tonight is there?&quot; Aeka said with 
well-founded worry.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so, everyone seems to be in a good mood.&quot; Nicole noted.

&quot;I hope so.&quot; Aeka sighed.

&quot;What&#39;s with the goofy movies!?&quot; Celest shouted over to Nicole.

&quot;They&#39;re Zell&#39;s.&quot; Nicole smiled fondly.

&quot;That doesn&#39;t surprise me.&quot; Xu laughed.

&quot;Really, considering he&#39;s a big kid at heart.&quot; Rinoa joked.

&quot;Quistis! I thought you brought something good? Anything with Duris, or 
Moore, they&#39;re such studs, or better yet one with Lore.&quot;

&quot;You mean Laguna!?&quot; Quistis laughed.

&quot;Ew he&#39;s old.&quot; Aeka giggled.

&quot;He&#39;s not -that- old.&quot; Xu said with a sly smile.

Fujin blanched and looked confused.

&quot;He used to be in action movies before he became president.&quot; Celest 
explained. &quot;His ass is scrumptious.&quot; She shivered and smiled saucily.

&quot;Ack!&quot; Rinoa looked at her in shock.

&quot;You&#39;re a insatiable.&quot; Nicole blushed in horror.

&quot;I think I&#39;m to young for where you guys are going with this 
conversation.&quot; Aeka paled.

&quot;Nonsense.&quot; Celest laughed wolfishly. &quot;You&#39;re what, like seventeen?&quot;

&quot;Eighteen.&quot; Aeka said proudly.

&quot;Even better.&quot; Celest winked.

&quot;Mind not corrupting the youth please.&quot; Xu said sourly.

&quot;Oh and you two.&quot; Celest added pointing to Rinoa and Xu. &quot;You can stop 
with the holier than though act.&quot;

&quot;I hear he&#39;s still single.&quot; Nicole added, bringing the conversation back 
to Laguna. Fujin sat down and shook her head.

&quot;You&#39;ve met him before Quisty is he still hot?&quot; Celest asked with an 
eager grin. Fujin looked up expectantly at Quistis curious as to how she 
would answer.

&quot;Oh wow, um, gee I dunno.&quot; She stammered awkwardly. &quot;Ask Rinoa she met 
him too.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, under much distress.&quot; Rinoa said sarcasticly.

&quot;Hey! He came here a month or so ago didn&#39;t he?&quot; Aeka asked.

&quot;Sure did.&quot; Xu said

&quot;I hear he looks like Squall. Is that true?&quot; Aeka wondered and looked to 
Rinoa curiously.

&quot;Ohhh even better!&quot; Celest beamed.

&quot;Hey now!&quot; Rinoa said dangerously.

&quot;Squall has a nice butt too.&quot; Celest said laughingly at Rinoa.&#39;

&quot;Hussy!&quot; Rinoa shoved her into Xu playfully. Xu scowled and shoved her 
back at Rinoa.

&quot;Hey, hey I&#39;m delicate.&quot; Celest pouted.

Fujin snorted derisively.

&quot;Not you too.&quot; Celest huffed sourly. Fujin arched a brow and smirked.

&quot;Okay enough.&quot; Quistis chuckled and went to her bags. &quot;Yes I have a tape 
and yes I have one with Laguna. It&#39;s some sword and sorcery film.&quot;

&quot;Oh cool.&quot; Aeka said brightly and plopped down on the couch.

&quot;I&#39;ll be in there in a moment.&quot; Nicole said while putting the finishing 
touches on the snack tray she&#39;d been preparing.

&quot;It&#39;s better be good.&quot; Celest huffed. &quot;Scoot squirt.&quot; She said with a 
smile and squished down beside Aeka.

&quot;Don&#39;t touch her Aeka, lord knows what you&#39;re liable to get.&quot; Rinoa 
joked as she got comfortable in the floor.

&quot;Ew.&quot; Aeka looked worried.

&quot;HEY!&quot; Celest snapped at the insult. &quot;Gah is this pick on Celest night 
or what?&quot; She pouted and hugged pillow.

Xu went to stand by Fujin who leaned against the door away from the 
crowd.

&quot;Do they always...&quot; She started to ask.

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot; Fujin answered.

&quot;Going to be a long night then?&quot;

Fujin nodded.

&quot;I head that.&quot; Quistis said with a teasing sneer. &quot;You two behave.&quot;

Xu sneered back and Fujin shrugged in response.

A loud knock on the door startled the two.

&quot;That would be Selphie I bet.&quot; Rinoa said.

Fujin moved away and Xu opened the door.

&quot;Xu!?&quot; Selphie blinked as she walked in. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;What? I can&#39;t visit now and again?&quot; Xu said with a defensive smile.

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean it like that.&quot; Selphie sulked in embarrassment.

Xu laughed.

&quot;I&#39;m teasing. Congratulations, I heard the news.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m still trying to wrap my mind around it myself.&quot; Selphie blushed. &quot;I 
have something for Nikki where is she?&quot;

&quot;Over there.&quot; Xu pointed to the kitchen.

&quot;Aha! Irvine come on.&quot; Selphie shouted right as Xu started to the door.

&quot;Watch it.&quot; Irvine said as he slipped past the door. In his arms he 
carried a large baker&#39;s box.

The gang in the living room waved and shouted their greetings as Selphie 
walked past and into the kitchen.

&quot;Selphie hi!&quot; Nicole smiled hugging the small woman.

&quot;Happy birthday, sorry I&#39;m late it was my job to pick the cake up and we 
couldn&#39;t find the place

&quot;You didn&#39;t have too go through all that.&quot; Nicole blushed.

&quot;Enough of that. It was our pleasure.&quot; Irvine smiled.

&quot;Don&#39;t listen to him. He whined the whole time.&quot; Selphie whispered with 
a grin. She turned to face Irvine and pointed to the door.

&quot;What I can&#39;t stay!?&quot; He looked hurt.

&quot;We talked about this.&quot; Selphie said with a stern grin.

&quot;But it&#39;s a room full of beautiful women.&quot; Irvine said desperately and 
pointed to the living room where Quistis was pounding on the top of the 
television in a vain attempt to get it working right.

&quot;Poor thing.&quot; Nicole laughed brightly at him.

&quot;See Nicole agrees with me. It&#39;d be horrible to deny me this. It&#39;s every 
guys dream.&quot; He pleaded.

&quot;Ew, all the more reason to go away.&quot; Selphie joked and started pushing 
him towards the door.

&quot;Hi bro!&quot; Celest shouted and waved.

&quot;Celest! Tell her to let me stay!&quot; Irvine begged. &quot;Hey when does 
everyone get in lingerie and lounge around.&quot;

&quot;THAT&#146;S YOUR SISTER!&quot; Rinoa shrieked and turned green.

Aeka blushed brightly.

&quot;Irvine Kinneas!&quot; Quistis shouted and pointed to the door.

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean her! Gah what do you think I am a pervert!?&quot; Irvine said 
in disgust.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Selphie giggled and elbowed him out the door.

&quot;At least take pictures.&quot; He tried.

&quot;OUT!&quot; nearly everyone shouted.

&quot;But.&quot; Irvine looked mournful.

&quot;No buts ya lug.&quot; Selphie laughed and hopped to kiss him in the nose.

&quot;I&#39;ll be lonely.&quot; He pouted.

&quot;Nice try you cad.&quot;

&quot;Aw well, can&#39;t blame a guy for trying.&quot;

&quot;Yeah right. Goodnight.&quot; She giggled brightly. &quot;I love you.&quot;

&quot;If you really love me you take pictures.&quot; He said slyly.

&quot;Oh, you.&quot; She huffed in disgust and shut the door.

&quot;Night ya&#39;ll.&quot; He called through the door.

Nicole burst into a fit of laughter as Selphie slid down the door 
panting.

&quot;He&#39;s horrible.&quot; She giggled. &quot;Happy birthday Nikki.&quot;

&quot;Thanks hon.&quot; Nicole smiled.

&quot;NICOLE!&quot; Quistis shouted with apparent annoyance.

&quot;What!?&quot; Nicole shouted back.

&quot;What&#39;s with you&#39;re TV!?&quot; Quistis said standing behind the device with a 
handful of cables.

&quot;Quistis broke it.&quot; Rinoa said accusingly.

&quot;Typical blonde.&quot; Celest laughed.

&quot;AGREED.&quot; Fujin said dryly.

&quot;Oh!&quot; Quistis turned and glared in shock &quot;you...&quot; She hissed wickedly.

Xu fell into a fit of laughter.

&quot;I&#39;ll mess with it.&quot; Aeka said quietly and lead Quistis from behind the 
Television. Quistis handed Aeka the wires and went to glare face to face 
with Fujin, who stood impassively and thoroughly unimpressed.

&quot;I&#39;ll get you.&quot; Quistis promised, a grin playing on her lips.

Fujin arched a brow.

&quot;Alright you all shut up and come see the cake.&quot; Selphie called, waving 
them all over.

Everyone made their way into the dinning room and gathered around the 
table. Selphie led everyone in a round of happy birthday; Fujin of 
course stayed silent and stood a bit back from everyone else. With the 
song done Selphie opened the box and smiled proudly.

Aeka screamed and turned bright red.

&quot;WHOA!&quot; Quistis gawked in shock then covered Aeka&#39;s eyes with her hands.

&quot;That&#39;s creative.&quot; Rinoa said shaking her head.

&quot;Now that&#39;s more like it!&quot; Celest laughed proudly and patted Selphie on 
the back.

&quot;That, that...that&#39;s disgusting...&quot; Xu said with a mix of awe and 
horror.

&quot;I&#39;m not eating that.&quot; Nicole said staring in shock.

Fujin took a step forward and looked.

&quot;PHALLIC.&quot; She said simply then went back to where she&#39;d been standing.

&quot;What?&quot; Selphie asked ominously then slowly looked down at the cake.

&quot;CELEST!&quot; She screamed and shut the box.

&quot;What!?&quot; Celest blinked and staggered back defensively.

&quot;You changed the order!&quot; Selphie shouted in an utter tiff.

&quot;If only.&quot; Celest chuckled. &quot;I wish I&#39;d thought of that but sadly it 
wasn&#39;t me.&quot;

&quot;I think I need to go home.&quot; Aeka giggled from under Quistis&#39;s hands.

&quot;Who did it?&quot; Selphie snapped.

No one said a word.

&quot;Irvine?&quot; Rinoa offered.

&quot;He wouldn&#39;t do that.&quot; Nicole said in his defense.

&quot;Really, he&#39;s a hound, but that&#39;s just tacky.&quot; Quistis smirked.

&quot;Error?&quot; Aeka suggested.

&quot;We can call the bakery?&quot; Xu said picking up the phone and handing it to 
Selphie.

&quot;No, it&#39;s to late, they&#39;re closed by now.&quot;

&quot;We could just eat the damn thing.&quot; Celest pointed out. &quot;I mean it&#39;s 
just a cake for crying out loud.&quot;

Everyone looked at her sourly.

&quot;Let&#39;s just watch the movie.&quot; Nicole giggled.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Nikki.&quot; Selphie said with overwhelming regret.

&quot;Please.&quot; Nicole waved her worry away. &quot;It&#39;s funny, gross but funny.&quot;

&quot;Well at least we have the pizzas.&quot; Rinoa said cheerfully.

Aeka dismissed herself to get the television working.

&quot;I still think we should have called a stripper.&quot; Celest mumbled to 
herself as she cut a piece of the cake.

&quot;You would.&quot; Rinoa said in playful disgust.

&quot;Come on lets just watch the movie.&quot; Nicole suggested.

Xu walked over to Quistis and Fujin who stood watching the exchanges.

&quot;Interesting friends you&#39;ve made Quistis. I should come by more often.&quot;

&quot;You were always welcome. You&#146;re the one who stopped coming by.&quot; Quistis 
noted.

&quot;Old news.&quot; Xu said simply.

&quot;NIDA?&quot; Fujin said.

&quot;What?&quot; Xu blinked. &quot;What about him?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s curious as to where he&#39;s at.&quot; Quistis translated.

&quot;Oh, well he said he had some minor maintenance to work on the bridge 
he&#39;ll probably be up there all night.&quot; Xu explained.

&quot;You staying the night too?&quot; Quistis asked.

&quot;Nah, I&#39;d be to uncomfortable, I really don&#39;t know theses guys to well. 
Besides you all have a full house as is.&quot;

Uproarious laughter erupted from the living room. The television was 
working properly now and showed a close up Zell singing a poor rendition 
of a popular love song.

&quot;IDIOT.&quot; Fujin scoffed.

&quot;I think it&#39;s cute.&quot; Quistis responded with a quaint smile.

&quot;No one would embarrass themselves like that for me.&quot; Xu laughed

&quot;Oh I bet Nida would.&quot;

Xu looked at her dubiously.

&quot;There goes.&quot; Quistis nodded to the movie starting.

&quot;Hey hit the lights!&quot; Celest shouted to her.

Quistis turned and flipped the switch before making her way to the 
living room. Xu and Fujin exchanged glances then followed.

****************

&quot;Seifer, man I have to be honest with yah.&quot; Zell said cautiously.

&quot;Speak you words.&quot; Seifer said and sat down by the fire.

&quot;I don&#39;t think she&#39;d be interested in ya.&quot;

&quot;Nonsense.&quot; Seifer laughed.

&quot;Zell.&quot; Squall coughed and shook his head. Last thing they needed was to 
antagonize the man.

&quot;Why journey to the dark and know pain?&quot; Seifer asked suddenly, his gaze 
growing dark. His steel blue eyes locking onto Squall.

&quot;A present.&quot; Squall said simply.

&quot;Foolishness.&quot; Seifer chuckled in disbelief.

&quot;No, he&#39;s telling the truth.&quot; Zell grinned and grabbed his bag. He 
carefully pulled out a grapefruit sized, bluish hued egg.

&quot;Ah he has brought a feast.&quot; Seifer chortled and reached for it.

&quot;WHOA, WHOA, wild man!&quot; Zell yelped and rolled clear of Seifer&#39;s 
grabbing hands.

&quot;It&#39;s a psuedo dragon.&quot; Squall explained further.

&quot;For my gal.&quot; Zell smiled.

&quot;You!?&quot; Seifer said in shock then erupted into heavy guffaws.

&quot;Ass.&quot; Zell grumbled and ignored him. &quot;Boss? What are we going to do 
with him?&quot;

&quot;I have no idea.&quot; Squall sighed.

&quot;We talking him back to Balamb?&quot; Zell asked curiously.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, perhaps, Edea may be able to do something with him.&quot;

&quot;Dude are you sure that&#146;s a good idea.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s just worry about getting out of here first.&quot;

&quot;Edea, the one, the part, in my mind she sang, so much less though than 
she. Now lost in her, swirling uncomprehending.&quot;

&quot;Yeah okay.&quot; Zell shrugged and looked back at Squall. &quot;We gotta get out 
of here before we start acting like him.&quot;

&quot;Edea!&quot; Seifer shouted abruptly.

&quot;Dude pipe down.&quot; Zell said with an annoyed glance.

&quot;Edea!&quot; Seifer shouted again.

&quot;What about her?&quot; Zell shouted back.

&quot;Edea!&quot; Seifer screamed this much louder

&quot;Seifer.&quot; Squall sighed. &quot;What do you want?&quot;

&quot;Leave this place of darkness, help in halting it, restore the knight, 
will be onward ever more, then with my heart and soul.&quot; Seifer smiled 
merrily.

&quot;I say we gag him for the night.&quot; Zell offered with an all to eager 
smile.

&quot;I think he liked my idea about Edea.&quot; Squall said quietly.

Seifer nodded briskly.

&quot;That&#146;s a bad call dude.&quot; Zell groaned. &quot;Besides he won&#39;t tell us how he 
got here.&quot;

&quot;Aid and all shall be revealed to the idiots.&quot; Seifer taunted.

&quot;Get us off this island and we&#39;ll talk.&quot; Squall said firmly.

&quot;Trust is given freely, not so one would think, betray and lie&#39;s abound 
in all foes and friends.&quot; Seifer chuckled.

&quot;He doesn&#39;t trust us.&quot; Zell translated.

&quot;I know what he said.&quot; Squall frowned. He knew there was no way off this 
island without the Ragnarok or whatever contraption brought Seifer here. 
He also had little doubt that Seifer&#39;s condition could very well befall 
them all. He hoped Seifer&#39;s madness was in fact an illness of some sort 
and not caused by some new foulness brought about by Ultimecia.

&quot;Squall, man what are we gonna do?&quot; Zell said in growing dismay.

&quot;Stop asking me that! Let me think.&quot; Squall snapped bitterly. Zell 
looked hurt and sat down without a word by the fire.

&quot;Who now is mad?&quot; Seifer smiled darkly.

&quot;Shut up!&quot; Squall scowled. &quot;Fine, Seifer, we&#39;ll take you to Edea.&quot;

&quot;Know this, I have and will.&quot; Seifer laughed.

&quot;But, we&#39;ll keep and eye on you and, you go disarmed and pass any 
guardians to me or Zell.&quot; Squall said with the clear understanding that 
he would brook no argument.

Seifer thought a moment and nodded.

&quot;Morrow then, rest now, sleep and grow wide with stuff of eating.&quot;

&quot;Fine, but hand over the blade and guardian&#39;s now.&quot; Squall said flatly.

Seifer nodded and gathered his Gunblade, with a snort he tossed it to 
Squall.

He then walked over to Zell and grabbed his hand.

&quot;What!?&quot; Zell yelped and pulled back but Seifer held fast. Seifer glowed 
white for a moment. Then slowly the light spread to Zell and as is did 
so it dimmed around Seifer&#39;s form. Finally the transfer was made and 
Seifer staggered back looking tired and depleted.

Zell smiled broadly and flexed.

&quot;Hey, hey, hey, kick ass.&quot; He chuckled. &quot;Nice guardian&#39;s Seifer what are 
they&#39;re names?&quot;

&quot;Nemesis, Epoch, Neith and Pyre called they. Attach not, returned most 
assuredly very soon.&quot; Seifer groaned and fell atop the pile of furs he 
called a bed and soon was fast asleep.

Zell looked at him and smiled. &quot;At least he&#39;s shut up. I hope you&#39;re 
doing the right thing. Man, Nikki is probably mad as hell at me. It&#39;s 
her birthday you know.&quot;

Squall said nothing but sat staring at the fire. He hoped too that he&#39;d 
made the right choice.

************

It was well into the night by time they got tired of movies. Aeka had 
already left a few hours early having homework to tend to. Now as the 
credits scrolled by on the last film Xu was preparing to leave.

&quot;I must say it&#39;s been a fun evening.&quot; She laughed lightly. &quot;Nicole it 
was pleasure getting to know you better and happy birthday. By the way 
don&#39;t worry about Zell he&#39;ll be back soon I&#39;m sure of it.&quot;

Nicole hugged her warmly much to Xu&#39;s surprise.

&quot;Thanks Xu, I hope you&#39;re right.&quot;

&quot;She is.&quot; Selphie winked.

&quot;Say hi to Nida for me.&quot; Quistis said as she walked Xu to the door.

&quot;I sure will.&quot; Xu grinned and waved to the other girls in the room. 
&quot;Night all!&quot; She said merrily before heading home for the night.

Fujin sat on the couch still observing everyone as they stood chatting. 
She too pondered heading to her room for the night. Quistis had decided 
she&#39;d sleep over with Nicole so she wouldn&#146;t be alone on her birthday. 
Rinoa and Selphie where apparently staying also. Celest stayed long 
enough to have another piece of cake before she too left for the night. 
Nicole locked the door and sat down at the kitchen table joined by 
Quistis, Rinoa and Selphie. Fujin heard them talking under the dim light 
of the dinning room, she didn&#39;t really try to listen in deciding it 
wasn&#39;t any of her business, though she caught enough to realize it was 
about Zell and Squall.

She also realized most everyone had forgotten about her as she sat 
quietly in the darkened living room. Quistis would look her way fondly 
and smile at her with her eyes.

Feeling the need to do something, anything she stood and went to the 
kitchen. There, she dutifully wrapped up the remains of the pizza and 
placed them in the refrigerator. Then she walked into the dinning room 
and returned the cake to its box and placed it atop the counter. After 
that she gathered the dishes scattered about the living room and carried 
them to the kitchen sink where she started to clean them. Her actions 
finally got Nicole&#39;s attention and she hopped up to see what Fujin was 
up to.

&quot;ACK Get out of here, I&#39;ll have no guest of mine doing MY dishes!&quot; She 
ranted and bodily pushed Fujin out of the kitchen.

&quot;PROTEST!&quot; Fujin stammered at the indignity of being shoved about.

&quot;Ah,ah,ah go sit down!&quot; Nicole ordered with mother like sincerity.

Fujin shrugged and went back to the living room to sit.

&quot;Why are you sitting in there by yourself you goof? Come in here and be 
social!&quot; Nicole said following her.

Quistis walked over to the two, as Fujin looked ready to start a reply.

&quot;Problem ladies?&quot; She asked with an amused smile.

&quot;She&#39;s trying to clean my house.&quot; Nicole said sourly.

&quot;Fu?&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;BORED.&quot; Fujin replied simply.

Quistis slapped her forehead; she never ceased being amazed by Fujin&#39;s 
lack of tact.

&quot;Oh so sorry we bore you.&quot; Nicole said with a sassy grin. &quot;You were the 
one sitting in here by yourself.&quot;

&quot;Nicole don&#39;t antagonize her.&quot; Quistis grinned trying desperately not to 
laugh at the ludicrous nature of the exchange.

Fujin stood stoically with her arms folded over her chest and looking 
slightly annoyed. The sight of her standing sour and annoyed while 
wearing pink oversized mog slippers was enough send Quistis over the 
edge. Giving in to the hail of laughter she fell against Fujin to steady 
herself. Fujin stood in quiet indifference to her antics even as Nicole 
started to give in to a case of the giggles. Sighing heavily Fujin 
looked sourly at Quistis who only laughed harder. Selphie and Rinoa 
walked into the living room to see what the commotion was about.

&quot;What in the world.&quot; Rinoa blinked in confusion.

&quot;You&#39;ve all gone mad.&quot; Selphie said after careful deliberation.

Fujin didn&#39;t see what was so funny and she picked Quistis up and 
deposited her unceremoniously onto the couch. Nicole had to sit down in 
the floor she was laughing so hard. Fujin looked at the two and shook 
her head before walking between Selphie and Rinoa.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with them?&quot; Selphie asked curiously.

Fujin grumbled and went back to doing the dishes.

*****************

Things went a little easier this time for Luccian and Archibald. They 
where able to narrow the location of the second key to a small area of 
the island of heaven. The Ragnarok landed atop a hilltop on the edge of 
a cliff. The sun had just settled over the horizon and dark shadows 
began to creep across the ground. Luccian and Archibald hurried down the 
gangplank and scanned the area. The two carried backpacks and climbing 
gear.

&quot;I have a question.&quot; Archibald asked as he checked his rappelling 
harness.

&quot;What.&quot; Luccian grinned excitedly.

&quot;Those ruins ya saw, are you sure it&#39;s the one we&#39;re looking for?&quot;

&quot;Positive.&quot; Luccian said holding up the black seeking stone.

&quot;Alright lets get this over with.&quot;

The two hooked their ropes to the Ragnarok&#39;s forward landing strut and 
headed towards the cliff face.

Archibald looked over the edge and frowned. The cliff was at least three 
hundred feet high and ocean waves smashed against jagged rocks below. 
About halfway down the cliff a man made ledge jutted out of the mouth of 
a cave. The ledge was crumbling and barely looked large enough for them.

&quot;This is crazy.&quot; He said and started back to the Ragnarok. Luccian 
grabbed him by the arm.

&quot;Now much longer man, this one should be a cake walk, I have Diablos 
warding us against monsters.

&quot;Yeah, lucky for you, and what about that lady man, I&#39;m willing to bet 
she don&#39;t care about friggin Diablos. Besides that ledge looks to fall 
at the any moment.&quot; Archibald snorted and jerked free.

&quot;It&#39;ll be fine, trust me.&quot; Luccian smiled again.

&quot;Last time you said that I got turned to stone and nearly killed by some 
lunatic.&quot; Archibald said, unconvinced

&quot;Fine, I&#39;ll go first, if nothing tries to eat me then will you come 
down?&quot; Luccian offered diplomatically.

&quot;Sure, and if ya fall, I&#39;ll be sure to tell your folks.&quot; Archibald 
laughed.

&quot;Don&#39;t bother.&quot; Luccian said darkly before hopping backwards off the 
cliff. Archibald folded his arms and waited, moments later he heard 
Luccian calling up to him.

&quot;See you idiot!&quot; He screamed loudly over the crash of the waves. &quot;This 
thing isn&#39;t going anywhere.&quot; He emphasized the point by jumping up and 
down madly, before finally stopping to regard Archibald sarcastically.

&quot;That good enough for ya princess?&quot;

&quot;Eat me.&quot; Archibald huffed under his breath and rappelled down the cliff 
to join Luccian.

Soon the two where making their way inside the darkened cavern hewn into 
the side of the cliff. The walls were carved with horrific shapes and 
gaping visages. Archibald pulled out a flashlight and studied the shapes 
with growing interest.

&quot;What&#39;s that crap mean?&quot; Archibald asked as they moved deeper into the 
cliff.

&quot;Nothing important.&quot; Luccian commented quietly as he slipped a dagger 
from his belt. He would have preferred his sword but had to make do with 
what was available. The path winded downward steeply and then leveled 
into a large round chamber. The room like the path was covered in runes 
and monstrous figures. These however, where inlaid with gold and silver 
and glimmered in the flashlights beam. In the middle of the room stood a 
statue, much like the one that waited for them on the other island. A 
tall beautiful woman clad in revealing garments. This statue was in 
better shape and was not nearly as eroded.

&quot;Oh no! Not me man. To hell with that.&quot; Archibald shouted and backed 
away from the statue.

&quot;Fine stay back I&#39;ll do it.&quot; Luccian said calmly and took out the seeker 
stone.

He approached the statue and placed the stone carefully in it&#39;s 
outstretched hand. This time the statue reacted immediately. The statue 
closed its hand and the gray rough stone faded away to soft flesh.

&quot;You again.&quot; Luccian said expectantly as the woman settled cold yellow 
eyes upon him. She said nothing to him aloud but he heard her clearly in 
his mind.

&quot;Mortal youth, you have kome all this way of you own devices. 
Resourceful

and brash, you are to be komended.&quot; She sang beautifully in his mind. 
Her voice was sweet and rich he felt as if intoxicated by it. Her beauty 
dazzled him, last time they met he was too fearful to truly appreciate 
her. But now he let his eyes feast upon the wondrous being before him.

&quot;You know how to free the guardian?&quot; Luccian said aloud.

&quot;How the hell do I know?&quot; Archibald said in annoyance. &quot;The statue 
didn&#39;t do anything man lets go, this is a bust.&quot; He stared sourly as 
Luccian stared transfixed at the statue.

&quot;Do you have faith that you are ready for such a task. The being you 
seek to kontrol demands great resolve.&quot; The woman said soothingly.

&quot;I understand.&quot; Luccian nodded.

Archibald watched warily as Luccian continued talking to himself. The 
notion to leave was just settling in when Luccian turned a faced him, a 
bright smile on his face.

&quot;What the hell was that about man!?&quot; Archibald asked. &quot;You about freaked 
me out.&quot;

&quot;Sorry.&quot; Luccian smiled. &quot;Check it out.&quot; He held out his hand and in it 
he held a golden, engraved disk.

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Archibald leaned to look curiously.

&quot;The last key.&quot; Luccian beamed proudly.

&quot;Serious!?&quot; Archibald laughed aloud. &quot;That was easy as hell. So what 
now?&quot;

&quot;We go to the last temple.&quot; Luccian said simply. &quot;Come on let&#39;s get back 
to the ship.&quot;

&quot;Rockin!&quot; Archibald turned and walked back up the path leading out. &quot;So 
how do we get there?&quot;

&quot;We have to summon the temple, it exists in the Umbra.&quot; Luccian 
responded.

&quot;Oh that, sounds fun.&quot; Archibald scoffed. &quot;How the hell do we do that!?&quot;

Luccian followed behind him thoughtfully.

&quot;Pretty easily actually, we just need to get something first.&quot;

&quot;Get what!? I&#39;m tired of this running around crap.&quot; Archibald 
complained.

&quot;A sacrifice.&quot; Luccian said with starling ease before burying his blade 
between Archibald&#39;s shoulders.</pre>
