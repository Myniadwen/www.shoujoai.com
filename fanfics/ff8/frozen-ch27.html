&quot;Feeling any better angel?&quot; Quistis whispered soothingly as Fujin awoke 
from her fevered sleep. Fujin looked at her blearily as her head swam.

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot; She said thickly, she was still slightly groggy but 
whatever was wrong had for the most part past.

&quot;TIME?&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s 8:30 at night, you&#146;ve slept all day yesterday and nearly all of 
this one. I was worried sick. I called the local doctor, he told me to 
keep an eye on you and if it didn&#146;t clear up by the morning or if you 
got worse to bring you in.&quot; Fujin groaned in dismay.

&quot;APOLOGY.&quot; She said glumly.

&quot;For what silly?&quot; Quistis chuckled as pressed a hand to Fujin&#146;s 
forehead. &quot;Your fever&#146;s broke, thank goodness.&quot; She said thankfully.

&quot;RUINED TRIP.&quot;

&quot;Hardly.&quot; Quistis blushed slightly. &quot;To be honest this has been one of 
the best times of my life.&quot;

Fujin smiled softly.

&quot;Hungry?&quot; Quistis asked with a bright smile.

Fujin nodded and tried to stand.

&quot;Ah Ah no you don&#146;t.&quot; Quistis gently pushed her back down. &quot;I&#146;ll get it, 
I ordered room service about ten minutes ago.&quot; She slipped out of bed 
and retrieved a tray full of food. There was hot soup, garlic bread, and 
small potatoes among other things all ready to eat. Fujin smiled 
thankfully as she sat up and Quistis settle the tray in her lap.

&quot;Waters on the nightstand. I&#146;m gonna take a long hot bath, give a holler 
if you need anything.&quot; She said with a wink as she began unbuttoning her 
long sleeved nightshirt. Fujin regarded her thoughtfully as she walked 
into the bathroom.

&quot;This isn&#146;t so bad.&quot; She though. She hadn&#146;t been pampered like this 
since she was a child. It was somewhat awkward for her to accept, but 
she felt it was best to try seeing how Quistis only wanted to help. She 
smirked lightly to herself as she began to eat.

Quistis lit the scented candles that sat atop the countertop and turned 
out the light. She smiled faintly at the sweet scent as she slipped out 
of her clothes. She tested the water with her toe before sliding into 
the bath till she was up to her neck in suds. Moaning softly as the hot 
water made her skin tingle she let her mind wander merrily.

All things considered she felt wonderful, she found that she was quite 
happy at the turn of events between her and Fujin. She also knew things 
would have to move at a pace Fujin was comfortable with. She smiled at 
the sweet memory of her lips and the heat of her body pressing against 
her. With a sigh she shook the memory from her mind as she laid a warm 
wet cloth across her face.

&quot;Hey Fu?&quot; She called inquisitively.

A moment passed before Fujin poked her head into the doorway and smirked 
at the sight of her buried under a mountain of lavender scented suds.

Quistis peeked out from under the cloth.

&quot;What do you want to do tomorrow, sleep in, hit the slopes, or what?&quot;

&quot;MOUNTAIN.&quot; Fujin said with blunt determination as she thought back to 
her disastrous first attempt at skiing. She was determined to master the 
art of skiing before they left this resort she decided.

&quot;Eh are you sure?&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Alright then.&quot; Quistis said simply then looked at her a moment.

&quot;Care to join me? There&#146;s plenty of room in here for the both of us.&quot; 
She said with a smile so inviting it made Fujin gasp in surprise.

&quot;I...?...!&quot; She stammered and blushed profusely. Quistis just smiled and 
settled the cloth back over her face.

&quot;Just teasing hon, calm down.&quot; She said reassuringly.

Fujin gave her a sour look that quickly softened to a more curious one. 
She walked quietly to the side of the bathtub and settled to her knees. 
With deft fingers she plucked the cloth from Quistis&#146;s eyes startling 
her slightly.

She looked at Fujin with an arched brow then playfully deposited a small 
cloud of suds onto her nose with a delicate finger. Fujin looked at the 
tip of her nose, and pushed her bottom lip out cutely to blow the suds 
away. Quistis giggled softly as Fujin gazed down into her eyes.

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis asked, growing increasingly interested in what was going 
on in Fujin&#146;s head. Fujin reached out with her hand and gently traced up 
Quistis&#146;s jaw with the back of her fingers.

&quot;LOVELY.&quot; She murmured softly, her voice taking the sultry tone it took 
whenever she tried to whisper. It was Quistis&#146;s turn to blush now and 
she did so vividly.

&quot;QUISTIS, CHANGED.&quot; Fujin said gesturing to her self by placing a hand 
over her heart.

&quot;Fu..&quot; Quistis sighed as she felt herself becoming swept away by 
emotion. Fujin paused a long moment as she gathered her resolve and 
tried to sort her words.

&quot;WANT...NEED..TO TELL.&quot;

&quot;You don&#146;t have to say anything.&quot; Quistis said, her voice soft and 
gently.

&quot;I DO...MEAN SO MUCH..&quot; She coughed and sighed in aggravation.

Quistis hung her head, feeling her pain and stress as if her own.

&quot;I KNOW....I AM DIFFICULT.&quot;

&quot;No you&#146;re not, don&#146;t say that.&quot; Quistis argued.

&quot;I AM TRYING....TO CHANGE....&quot; She coughed again but struggled on.

&quot;YOU TOOK CHANCE....WITH ME...YOU DON&#146;T HAVE TO....&quot;

&quot;Stop right there it&#146;s not a chance or a risk hon, I care for you, and 
that means all of you, good and bad. Don&#146;t ever think of yourself as a 
burden to me. You saved me from myself and showed me there is someone 
who loves me.&quot; Quistis said severely, she was almost insulted that Fujin 
thought she thought that way. &quot;Now I don&#146;t to hear anymore nonsense like 
that.&quot; Quistis huffed and pouted.

&quot;LOVE YOU.&quot; Fujin said softly, she was terrified to say it but she 
needed to speak the words, to hear for her self what Quistis already 
knew.

Quistis sighed and closed her eyes. Just hearing the words melted her 
heart.

&quot;Kiss me..&quot; Quistis whispered in a hushed tone as she reached out to 
her, Fujin blushed shyly as their lips met. Quistis, savoring the kiss 
cupped her face with both hands.

&quot;Nice.&quot; She murmured, her eyes dancing brightly as she gazed longingly. 
Fujin felt flushed and found herself short of breath, warm sensations 
welling up deep within her. Feelings she never dreamed possible anymore 
now came forth freely.

Quistis settled back into the tub comfortably, the billowing suds 
embracing her. Fujin looked down self-consciously; Quistis was a 
creature of elegant beauty, flawless, delicate, and perfect, so unlike 
herself. She slowly looked back up, her gaze moist with trembling tears 
and insecurity.

&quot;WHY ME...?&quot; She asked with a frightened murmur. Quistis sighed and 
smiled her wondrous, bright smile.

&quot;You have to ask.&quot; She said breezily as she rose out of the water.

Fujin bit her lip and looked down in surprise at Quistis&#146;s boldness, 
she&#146;d never felt so many tangled feelings. Fear, longing, doubt, joy, 
nervousness, love, they all tore through her now and threatened to 
consume her.

&quot;I..&quot; She said shakily, her heart threatening to explode in her chest. 
She would almost welcome it. Quistis stepped out the tub, steam drifting 
off her as she reached out and took Fujin&#146;s hands in hers.

&quot;You&#146;re the most important part of my life now. Before, I was just 
drifting along, day by day, year by year, waiting and hoping for 
something that I feared I&#146; d never find. Then somewhere I gave up, then 
I found myself waiting again, this time though I waited to die. I truly 
felt there was nothing else for me. I know you understand, you felt it 
too, I saw it in you&#146;re eyes a long time ago. When Seifer and Raijin 
left, I saw you standing alone watching the sunset. You looked so sad, 
so alone, so different from the Fujin I knew.&quot;

Fujin sighed and nodded grimly; she remembered that day well.

&quot;PHOTO.&quot; Fujin mumbled, remembering the picture in Quistis&#146;s apartment. 
She looked up from under her hair with a small accusing smirk.

Quistis smiled, and brushed the hair from her eye.

&quot;I couldn&#146;t help it, you looked too beautiful.&quot; She admitted with a 
smile.

&quot;THANK YOU.&quot; Fujin smiled vibrantly.

&quot;For what?&quot;

&quot;WORDS.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s the truth hon, you&#146;ve done so much for me, more that you know. I 
only hope I can return it somehow.&quot;

&quot;ALREADY HAVE.&quot; Fujin said seriously as she gently pulled Quistis to 
her.

Quistis smiled in pleasant shock and draped her arms over her shoulders. 
Fujin&#146;s hands settled on her bare waist, Quistis tingled at the contact 
and pressed closer as she leaned to kiss her once more.

Fujin shivered in foreign delight as her body responded to Quistis naked 
warmth pressed close against her. She gasped slightly as the kiss 
deepened, parts of her was nearly panicking, she had no idea what to do. 
Quistis ran her hands down her back feeling its firm gentle curves. She 
broke the kiss and paused, her gaze a dusky den on piercing blue as she 
looked deeply at Fujin. Short of breath and nearly faint Fujin looked 
back in surprise, she&#146;d never felt anything so intense as what she felt 
now. Something primal, wild, older than time, beyond the cares of the 
material and fleeting.

It scared her not because it was alien and unknown, it scared her 
because she wanted it, wanted to accept it wholly. Quistis too was taken 
aback and took a deep breath. She started to speak but Fujin silenced 
her with another kiss before taking a few steps back. She steadied 
herself and closed her eye as she worked through inner turmoil. Timidly 
she toyed with the hem of her shirt, then looked back to Quistis, 
drawing strength from the care and tenderness she found there. 
Wordlessly she slipped out of her clothes, trembling slightly as 
creeping fears of self doubt whispered in her mind. She stood bare and 
exposed, physically and emotionally vulnerable.

The more jaded part of her mind assaulted her and she could not bring 
herself to look at Quistis fearing what she would find there. Gentle 
hands wrapped around her shoulders as Quistis washed away those fears 
with a simple embrace that spoke more than mere words could ever dare. 
Fujin looked up, her ruby gaze glimmering. She knew now, more than ever, 
Quistis would never harm her, never abandon her, she&#39;d be there to 
protect and care for her unlike the other rare few she dared let into 
her life. Quistis kissed her forehead lovingly and led her by the hand 
to the tub.

Together they slipped into the waters, Quistis smiled brightly as they 
got comfortable and faced each other. Fujin was in bliss, the water was 
soothing enough to nearly put her to sleep and she felt far more relaxed 
now than she&#39;d ever had. Fujin was slightly surprised as Quistis began 
to gently bathe her with a large natural bath sponge, but soon returned 
the favor. Their bodies tingling as they quietly explored each other 
with delicate hands and soothing caresses.

Soon the water began to cool and they regretfully exited the tub. Taking 
turns, they carefully dried each, Quistis taking a moment to tussle 
Fujin&#39;s hair playfully drawing a dry look for her efforts. They walked 
into the bedroom, the fireplace bathing them in its warm glow. It was 
late and only sound came from the crackling flames and the soft tick of 
an old alarm clock on the nightstand. Quistis embraced Fujin from 
behind, hugging her tightly and nuzzling her neck, Fujin leaned back 
against her comfortably and sighed. She turned to face her, her 
expression one of rare contentment and peace. Quistis&#39;s heart melted at 
the sight of her so happy and kissed her once more before pulling her 
down onto the bed. They snuggled close as they got comfortable. The fire 
danced about lazily, it&#39;s radiant heat washing over their naked forms in 
soothing waves. They watched the flames in quiet peace, enjoying each 
other&#39;s closeness. No words where spoken between them and none where 
needed and soon, in each other&#39;s arms they fell into a soft rhythmic 
sleep.</pre>
