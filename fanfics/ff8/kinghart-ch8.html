<p msonormal="">            Quistis and  Xu lay side by side on the bed, their head pressed together Quistis sucked on a  lollypop that one of the Trepies had given her. In all truth, the Trepies  hadn’t given her anything…inappropriate. The worst thing she received from them  was a pair of kitty panties. Of course the gift giver was Ty Camfod, a Trepe to  the truest. He stalked her on a constant basis and had to be threatened with  expulsion before he stopped. And he snuck his present in with a card that said,  “You can wear this to class whenever you like.” The other gifts consisted of a  lollypop and a cute moogle hat, more cards for the “Card King” and what she  found most touching, a shirt with her picture on it and all the Trepies  signatures, wishing her a happy birthday. Cid and Edea got her flowers and a  necklace that Quistis found far too expensive to even consider. She made a  mental note to thank them and to repay them somehow.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Good  birthday?” Xu murmured, almost asleep. Quistis nodded. She was wide awake with  all the recent events. “I love you.”</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Don’t say  that.” She replied.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Why?”</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Because  what if I don’t really love you in return?” Quistis asked. The last thing she  wanted to do was to lie to her best friend. Xu shrugged feebly.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “I don’t  care.” She fell asleep right after. Quistis pressed her forehead against Xu.  She closed her eyes and thought. <em>I’m not strong enough to protect you,</em> she thought before she too slipped into sleep.</p>
<p msonormal="">            <em>Quistis  knew she was running but from what? She tried to stop and get a better look but  her feet would not obey her mind. She could not stop running.</em></p>
<p msonormal=""><em>            “Where  are you going?” A voice asked. She craned her head to look. The shadow of  Ultimecia crept up on her.</em></p>
<p msonormal=""><em>            “Ultimecia!”  She pulled out her whip but it was covered in blood. She dropped it  immediately. Ultimecia walked through the mist, carrying Xu’s dead body in her  arms.</em></p>
<p msonormal=""><em>            “Why  run, my child? After all, it was you who killed her. You’ll do nothing but hurt  people if you continue to live. Let me end it all.” Xu’s body began  disappearing.</em></p>
<p msonormal=""><em>            “NO!”  Quistis screamed, running towards her. Ultimecia smiled but it was her smile that  frightened Quistis the most. It wasn’t filled with malice or evil or even  hatred. It was a calm, reassuring smile that Quistis found all too relaxing.</em></p>
<p msonormal=""><em>            “Surely…child…you  must know. Come, come to me, my child.” Quistis fell to her knees, her heart  felt like it was being torn to bits and pieces then set on fire. Ultimecia  rested a hand on Quistis’s head, a gesture of…love? She looked up again and  stared into blue eyes. But Ultimecia didn’t have blue eyes. Suddenly, a man  appeared beside her.</em></p>
<p msonormal=""><em>            “Die,  Quistis.” He hissed. He wore a white robe with gold lining around the collar  and cuffs. He had dark brown hair and eyes that held something holy within  them.</em></p>
<p msonormal=""><em>            “Hyne…”  Quistis whispered.</em></p>
<p msonormal=""><em>            “This is  your future.” He whispered, gesturing to the still disappearing body of Xu.  “Everyone you love will die if you don’t. You will aid Ultimecia into her rise  and I, Hyne cannot allow that.”</em></p>
<p msonormal=""><em>            “I…I  will aid Ultimecia?” She said in disbelief, her eyes tearing yet again,  blurring the image of Hyne.</em></p>
<p msonormal=""><em>            “Yes.”</em></p>
<p msonormal="">.</p>
<p msonormal="">.</p>
<p msonormal="">            Quistis  woke up. She sat up and gazed down at the still sleeping figure of Xu. She  covered her face with her hands. It was just a dream. But that dream explained  who the voice in her head was. Maybe she really was going to help Ultimecia  rise again. If that was the case, then Hyne was right, she had to die before  anything happened. She loved Xu dearly and she needed to protect her. The only  way she could think of protecting her was doing exactly as the voice said…</p>
<p msonormal="">            Xu stirred,  awakened by the sudden movement of Quistis getting off the bed. She opened her  eyes and saw her standing on the balcony overlooking the cliffs and sea. Xu sat  up and observed. Quistis wasn’t herself. She could tell that she was sad about  something. She stood up and went over to give her a much needed hug.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Whatcha  thinking about?” Xu asked. Quistis didn’t reply nor did she show any signs of  affection back. “Quistis?”</p>
<p msonormal="">            “It’s  nothing. Go back to sleep.”</p>
<p msonormal="">            “What did  we say about keeping things inside?” Xu said, placing her chin on Quistis’s  shoulders. “If we’re going to get anywhere in this relationship…”</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Xu…don’t  say that…don’t say that we’re in a relationship when I’m not sure of anything.”  Xu cringed at her tone of voice and removed her arms.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Quistis…”  Feeling alone and unwanted, Xu curled up on the bed and drifted, hoping that  the morning would bring something other than hurt. Quistis heaved a sigh  slumped to her knees, wondering if she could ever truly be happy.</p>
<p msonormal="">            <em>Kill  yourself now. While she’s asleep and can’t stop you.</em></p>
<p msonormal="">            “I can’t…”  She whispered. “Xu…”</p>
<p msonormal="">            <em>You will  only cause more pain.</em></p>
<p msonormal="">“No…”</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Don’t even  think about it!” Xu snapped. Quistis’s head slowly turned around as she  regarded her with sad eyes. “I know what you’re thinking. Don’t you dare even  think that way.” Quistis couldn’t help herself any longer. Even though she knew  that the slightest contact would only serve to make Xu love her even more, she  gracefully strode over and embraced her like it was their last time.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “I’ll never  let you go.” Xu murmured in her ear. Quistis felt tear pricking the ends of her  eyes.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Don’t…say  that…”</p>
<p msonormal="">.</p>
<p msonormal="">.</p>
<p msonormal="">            Squall was  in the middle of dozing when he heard a knock on the door. He groaned and  rolled over. The knock became more insistent and Rinoa woke up.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Squall…get  that would you?” She muttered. Squall cursed and sat up. He stumbled over to  the door and opened it. The blinding hallway light froze him in his tracks  before he heard Zell.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Sorry to  wake you, boss-man. We’ve got a problem though.” He said, jumping side to side.  Squall sighed and closed his eyes.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “What is  it?” He asked.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Um…I don’t  know how to explain this…you gotta see for yourself. There’s someone here  claiming that she’s…Adel.”</p>
<p msonormal="">.</p>
<p msonormal="">.</p>
<p msonormal="">            The  doorbell to Xu’s house rang several times before either of them noticed it.  Both stood up, disoriented, and opened the door.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Zell?!”  Quistis exclaimed, thoroughly surprised.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Sorry to  barge into this wonderful vacation and all but Squall wants you back this  instant. We’ve got a situation on our hands.” He explained meekly. Xu looked at  the clock. It read 5:00 AM.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Zell,  can’t it wait?” She sighed. Quistis however was concerned.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Give us  five minutes to get ready.” She closed the door. Xu stared at her in horror.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Quistis,  it’s only been what, three days? We can’t leave now!”</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Squall  wants us back, right? It’s an emergency. Squall wouldn’t call us back unless it  was.” She said nonchalantly.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “But it’s  your birthday present.” Xu protested.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “It doesn’t  matter, I had a great time while we were here.” But she didn’t look up or give  any signs that she was truly happy. Instead, she looked down the entire time  she got dressed.</p>
<p msonormal="">            Zell paced  back and forth a good number of times before the door opened and a fully  dressed Quistis and Xu emerged. Xu locked the door and the three went to the  Ragnarok.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “We forgot  to call someone about the car.” Xu noted.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “We can do  that later.” Quistis replied. They sat downstairs while Zell flew, each  wondering what to say to the other. Finally, Quistis broke the silence.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Xu, I…”</p>
<p msonormal="">            <em>You’ll  only hurt her.</em> Hyne’s voice echoed her darkest fears. She mustered up all  the courage that she possessed.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “I want to  break our relationship.” It came out no more than a pained whisper. Xu hung her  head silently. She knew it was eventual. With everything going the way it was,  Quistis obviously had no time nor heart for her. She couldn’t force a smile.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Ok.” She  replied weakly. She hurt inside.</p>
<p msonormal="">            <em>That’s  it. It won’t hurt anyone as much when you die. Just push them away.</em></p>
<p msonormal="">            <em>Shut up,</em> she thought. <em>Just shut up.</em></p>
<p msonormal="">.</p>
<p msonormal="">.</p>
<p msonormal="">            Squall  couldn’t stop checking his watch. They were all gathered around the office with  the person claiming to be Adel. Irvine tapped his foot impatiently, causing  Squall to become irritated. The others kept a close eye on “Adel,” their  weapons drawn and prepared to battle. Adel sat quietly. Suddenly, the door  opened and Zell, Quistis and Xu ran in, almost out of breath.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “We’re…here.”  Xu panted. She looked around and her eyes landed on Adel. “Who’s that?”</p>
<p msonormal="">            “It’s hard  to explain…” Rinoa began.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “She claims  she’s Adel.” Squall cut in. Quistis stared. Perched on top of a wooden chair  was a little girl with frightening eyes and black hair. She looked at each of  them intently and when her eyes landed on Quistis, she laughed.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “I get it  now!” she giggled. The others frowned. “Now I see.”</p>
<p msonormal="">            “I don’t  care if it’s hard to explain. I want to know what in Hyne’s name is going on!”  Quistis demanded.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “It’s like  this…” Irvine said. “She appeared at the gates of Balamb Garden just yesterday.  She looked all battered and we took her in. She told us she was Adel. At first  we didn’t believe her and then she started reciting all of the events that  occurred when we defeated Ultimecia.”</p>
<p msonormal="">            “I’m Adel,  only in a different form. And don’t worry, I can’t use most of my powers  anyway, I’m too small. When I grow up…it’ll be a different story.” She replied.  “But for the time being, I’m just as harmless as any other kid. Maybe a little  creepier but not so much as when you fought me.”</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Have you  decided on what you’re going to do?” Quistis asked. Everyone shook their heads.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “We’ve got  enough to worry about right now.” Squall sighed. “In my opinion, I think we  should just…”</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Lock them  both up?” Quistis snapped. “Is that your ingenious plan?” Squall turned his  head. “I know we’ve got a lot to think about, Seifer, Ultimecia and now Adel,  but we can’t solve the problem by putting them away.”</p>
<p msonormal="">            “That’s  what Laguna did.” Selphie pointed out.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “That’s not  the point!” Quistis looked to Xu for backup but she had her head cast down with  different thoughts running through her head.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Balamb  Garden should not be turned into a dangerous place.” Squall hissed dangerously.  He crossed his arms. <em>This is too much. We can’t let these two run free, and  in the same spot. It’s like we’re gathering them up just to hand them to Ultimecia.  Our best bet is to send both of them into space. If we manage to do that then…</em></p>
<p msonormal="">            “Squall.”  Cid spoke up. “If it’s too much trouble to keep her here, then we can look  after her at the orphanage. She doesn’t seem to pose too much threat. I’m sure  we can keep her under control there.”</p>
<p msonormal="">            “I’d like  that.” Adel replied, looking to Squall for confirmation.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Do what  you want, I don’t care.” He sighed. He was fed up with arguing. If Cid wanted  to get himself into danger…</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Are you  sure?” Irvine asked. “I’ve got to protest.”</p>
<p msonormal="">            “I’m quite  sure.” Cid said with confidence. “Besides, we still have a few days to think  about it before we leave. Edea and I have been through worse. We can surely  handle it.” He gave them all a sweet smile. “Onto business. I just received a  phone call from Dollet. Apparently, some suspicious characters have been  causing innumerable amounts of damage nearby and they want to hire SeeD to  investigate.”</p>
<p msonormal="">            “We’ll go.”  Selphie’s hand shot up. “I’ve been so bored around here!” Quistis glanced at Xu  again. Everyone nodded.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Good, then  I’ll call up the mayor and tell them that you’re on your way.” Squall covered  his face with his forehead. It was just too much. He needed to kill a couple of  monsters to relieve his anger.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “What a  surprise…to think…” Adel walked up to Quistis and studied her. “You of all  people.”</p>
<p msonormal="">            “W-What are  you talking about?” She demanded.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “Surely you  know.” She smiled in a way that made Quistis feel even uneasier.</p>
<p msonormal="">            “For the  time being, Quistis, I leave it in your hands to have the most elite SeeD watch  over her. Give her a room but keep it monitored at all times.” Squall ordered. Her  head shot up and she nodded. Mean while, Xu had not heard a word anyone had  said. Her entire existence could’ve been meaningless. She no longer cared for  anything. <em>I will always love you.</em> She thought. <em>Even if you don’t love  me.</em></p>
