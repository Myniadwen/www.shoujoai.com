Though they were victorious, it didn&#39;t feel like it, and the trip home 
was a silent affair with few words spoken between anyone. Seifer had 
awakened, but not once did he complain about being bound, nor was he 
angry with Fujin for striking him. He sat quietly observing the tortured 
looks on everyone&#146;s faces. He didn&#39;t know the girl who died but he did 
feel pity for those that did. Edea sat across from him, a look of 
foreboding on her pale face. She was obviously troubled; the loss of 
student and what he was planning to do obviously weighed heavily on her 
mind.

He glanced up as Squall walked over and sat down.

&quot;Time to talk.&quot; The moody leader said in an eerily calm tone. Seifer 
looked at Edea and nodded knowingly before regarding Squall.

&quot;Fair enough.&quot; He said mildly.

Squall&#146;s expression tightened as if he were about to scream, but he did 
not and all he could think to say was. &quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;After everything that happened, I cannot allow Griever to remain free.&quot; 
Seifer said with annoying simplicity.

&quot;So, what then? You and Edea came up with a plan to lock Griever away. 
But how do you plan to do that? Griever isn&#146;t going to sit idly by while 
you try and contain it.&quot; Squall queried.

&quot;So long as I can resist his control, he is effectively trapped within 
me.&quot; Seifer smirked as if nearly proud of himself.

&quot;What made you think you could control it.&quot; Squall hissed harshly at 
Seifer&#146;s obvious recklessness.

&quot;If anything I&#146;m stubborn, I knew I could hold him in.&quot; Seifer shrugged.

&quot;That arrogance is typical of you, you&#146;ve haven&#146;t changed.&quot; Squall 
scowled in annoyance, then looked at him skeptically. &quot;What happens when 
you can&#39;t resist any longer.&quot; He prodded.

&quot;That won&#39;t be an issue.&quot; Edea said quietly, drawing his attention.

&quot;Any why not?&quot; Asked Squall. &quot;He&#146;s pig headed but I have no doubt that 
he&#146;ll eventually end up like Luccian.&quot;

&quot;Because as soon as we return to Balamb I&#39;ll go to Esthar. Griever and I 
will be sealed in stasis.&quot; Seifer explained with an eerie casualness.

&quot;Stasis?&quot; Squall sat up straight, looking bewildered.

&quot;Yes like Adel was.&quot; Seifer smirked.

Rinoa, who&#146;d been sitting nearby and eavesdropping, jumped up from her 
seat. &quot;You what! Squall you can&#146;t let him do it!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not going to happen.&quot; Squall said firmly then looked at Edea in 
shock. &quot;And you, I can&#39;t believe you even considered this. What did you 
tell him?&quot; Seifer rolled his eyes.

&quot;Squall, shut up and sit down. You had you day as a hero, it&#39;s my turn.&quot; 
He chuckled snidely.

&quot;Seifer, this isn&#39;t about some stupid rivalry. You&#39;ll be good as dead if 
you go through with this.&quot; Squall said gravely.

&quot;Nah, I&#39;ll be conscious, the whole time.&quot; Seifer smirked.

&quot;You&#39;re insane, that&#39;s horrible.&quot; Rinoa shouted.

&quot;Look at it this way, it&#39;ll give me time to think. Sort things out.&quot; He 
chuckled. Squall looked at him with obvious worry.

&quot;Seifer, you don&#39;t have to do this. Okay yes, you&#39;re a bastard 
especially after what you did to Fujin, but even you don&#39;t deserve a 
fate like that.&quot;

Seifer grinned widely and shook his head. &quot;I don&#146;t know whether to be 
insulted or flattered.&quot;

Squall looked absolutely flabbergasted then calmed down and spoke 
slowly.

&quot;I don&#146;t think you realize what you&#146;re doing. No one blames you for what 
happened with Ultimecia. You don&#146;t have to do this.&quot;

Seifer sneered as he saw the almost pleading look in Squall&#146;s eyes and 
it nearly made him want to retch.

&quot;Don&#39;t give me that crap you pompous ass.&quot; Seifer snapped irritably. 
&quot;You all think I&#39;m just some confused fool. Some kind of idiot that was 
duped by Edea or possessed by Ultimecia.&quot;

&quot;Seifer.&quot; Rinoa said quietly, part of her wishing he&#146;d shut up before he 
got himself into trouble.

&quot;Quit trying to protect me Rinoa.&quot; Seifer snapped angrily. &quot;Squall, I&#146;m 
going to let you in on a little secret. I knew full well what I was 
doing back then. I went with Ultimecia willingly. You want to know why? 
Because I wanted revenge, revenge for you taking everything away from 
me, for besting me in everything.&quot;

Squall looked downright stunned and Seifer continued unaffected.

&quot;Like you always said, I&#146;ve always been a prideful son of a bitch, I had 
to get you back because I hated you with a passion and nothing was going 
to stop me from making you pay.&quot; Seifer&#146;s eyes glinted dangerously and 
he sighed, shaking his head. &quot;So yes, I do deserve this.&quot; He said 
quietly, then exploded. &quot;So quit trying to put me on some fucking 
pedestal!&quot;

Squall stood up and backed away in downright horror and looked to Edea 
for conformation. With the beginnings of tears in her eyes she nodded 
silently.

&quot;Then, you knew?&quot; Squall whispered harshly to her.

&quot;Yes.&quot; She said firmly.

&quot;And you said nothing, all this time.&quot; Squall was beyond shocked now.

&quot;What would you have had me do.&quot; Edea sighed. &quot;You are all my children, 
how can you ask me to turn my back on any of you?&quot;

&quot;Oh but you&#39;re okay with him being sealed away in a living hell for all 
eternity.&quot; Rinoa snapped.

Edea grimaced sadly at the accusation.

&quot;Enough!&quot; Squall said sternly then looked at Edea accusingly. He didn&#39;t 
want to believe his ears but he had no choice.

&quot;Why are you letting this happen!&quot; Rinoa shouted bitterly at Edea.

Squall closed his eyes and tried to clear his head of rampant thoughts, 
to bring some measure of piece to his tormented mind. Finally he opened 
his eyes and looked at Seifer solemnly.

&quot;Because she knows it&#39;s the only way to save his life. There are 
countless people who would see him dead if this got out.&quot; He said 
quietly, the sadness and disappointment evident in his eyes.

&quot;Let it go Squall. I have.&quot; Seifer said softly, shaking his head.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Squall nodded slowly then quietly made his way to the bridge. 
Rinoa looked heartbroken, with a gasp of helplessness she ran after 
Squall.

Edea watched them leave sadly.

&quot;He feels I betrayed him.&quot; Edea sighed.

&quot;He&#146;s strong, he&#39;ll get over it.&quot; Seifer sighed.

&quot;You all are.&quot; Edea said darkly.

***********************

After dropping Squall of in Dollet to report their victory, Zell docked 
the Ragnarok back at Balamb Garden. The recruits walked quietly down 
landing ramp, some having to be carried while others limped along the 
best they could. Royce insisted on carrying Aeka to Dr Kadowaki&#39;s office 
where he would remain for the rest of the evening in mourning. Xu 
informed the recruits that they were to report back to class in a four 
days. Then she dismissed them without any fanfare. Not that anyone 
cared; none were in the mood to cheer their victory, hollow as it was.

Selphie and Rinoa left quietly, both them were tired and emotionally 
spent. The events of the evening bringing back unsettling memories of 
the last Sorceress war. Irvine was keeping a wary eye on Seifer whose 
hands were tied firmly behind his back. Edea joined them and together 
they shepherded Seifer to Balamb&#39;s brig where he&#146;d stay until they left 
for Esthar. Fujin was next to exit the ship and she waited quietly for 
Quistis who soon followed and walked past her without a word. Fujin 
looked hurt and nearly called out to her but couldn&#146;t bring herself to. 
Hanging her head and sighed sadly and was preparing to leave when Zell 
strolled down the ramp.

&quot;You&#39;re still here?&quot; He said moodily as he sealed the ship.

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot; Fujin said distantly.

&quot;Hellish night huh?&quot;

&quot;AFFI..&quot; She started the corrected herself. &quot;YES.&quot;

&quot;You alright? This must be awfully hard on you, I knew you and Aeka were 
friends.&quot;

Fujin looked at him and frowned slightly, she&#146;d never really thought of 
it before, and realized she&#146;d indeed grown quite fond of the girl. The 
realization just depressed her more. She stiffened and shrugged 
awkwardly.

&quot;I&#146;M BE FINE.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s bull, but I won&#39;t pressure you.&quot; He said with a fleeting smile. 
&quot;I wonder where Nicole is?&quot; He added absently.

&quot;UNKNOWN.&quot;

&quot;She said she&#39;d meet me here. It&#39;s late, I bet she fell asleep. I wonder 
if she knows?&quot; He mumbled under his breath.

Fujin sighed and hugged herself as if chilled.

&quot;You know she blames herself, Miss Trepe I mean.&quot; Zell said gravely and 
quite unexpectedly.

&quot;I KNOW.&quot; Fujin frowned.

&quot;She gets like that sometimes, I&#39;ve seen it before. It&#146;s like she thinks 
she&#146;s responsible for the whole world. But you&#39;re her friend, nothing 
new to you huh?&quot; He shrugged.

&quot;I SUPPOSE.&quot; Fujin said quietly. Nicole appeared in the distance and 
waved at them meekly.

&quot;There she is.&quot; Zell said with a soft smile as she approached him.

&quot;Sorry love, I ran into Quistis in the hall, she seems really down. I 
um, heard the news.&quot; Nicole explained as they embraced tightly.

&quot;Yeah, we were talking about that.&quot; He said as Nicole regarded Fujin 
thoughtfully.

&quot;You okay?&quot; She asked almost timidly. Fujin nodded but remained quiet. 
Zell scratched his head and shrugged helplessly.

&quot;I guess we&#39;ll be heading out then.&quot; He said graciously then paused to 
look at her thoughtfully. &quot;You um, want to come over, talk, get 
something to eat?&quot;

Fujin looked somewhat shocked by the gesture. With a faint smile she 
quietly declined.

&quot;Alright then, we&#146;re gone.&quot; He smiled warmly then patted her on the 
shoulder. &quot;Look, don&#39;t stress yourself out. Everything will work out. If 
ya need anything just swing by.&quot;

&quot;Good night.&quot; Nicole waved as they turned to leave. They had about made 
it to the door when Fujin called out to them.

&quot;THANK YOU.&quot; She called out awkwardly. Zell and Nicole looked at each 
other and smiled then waved goodbye. Now alone, Fujin stood quietly in 
the dim light of the hanger.

*******************

The face in the mirror was tired and drawn, she felt battered, 
emotionally and physically. With a soft sigh Quistis removed her glasses 
and turned on the sink&#146;s faucet. After wetting her face she started to 
get undressed, hoping a shower would make her feel better. Her mind was 
reeling; she couldn&#146;t get Aeka&#146;s face out of her mind. She died 
terrified and alone and it was something Quistis knew she&#146;d carry with 
her till the end of time.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry.&quot; She murmured softly, though no one was around to hear. It 
started with quiet tears. Over the course of the entire heart rending 
evening she&#146;d been able to keep her emotions in check.

It was imperative that she remained strong for her student&#146;s sake. Now 
though, alone, and free of the chains of responsibility the pain of loss 
and the burning, unrelenting sense of guilt bore down on her like a 
relentless giant smashing her to the floor. She collapsed, naked and 
trembling as wracking sobs tore through her weary form.

**************************

Fujin stood outside Quistis&#146;s door, her forehead resting against it as 
she tried to gather the courage to knock. Things had been bad between 
them recently. Fujin was still wounded by Quistis mistaken belief that 
she loved Seifer. But now, such matters seemed trivial and unimportant. 
Now, more than anything Fujin wanted to be with her, to share their 
pain. She knocked a feeble and timid sound. Taking a restless breath, 
she stood straight and knocked again, this time louder.

There was no answer and a grim thought tickled the back of Fujin&#146;s mind. 
Something frightening and chilling. With a frown, she knocked again.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Quistis answered from behind the door. Her voice sounded hollow 
and cold.

&quot;IT&#146;S ME&quot; Fujin called softly, feeling a sense of relief.

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis asked, still not opening the door.

&quot;TALK?&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m tired, besides, aren&#146;t you mad at me?&quot;

&quot;NOT FAIR.&quot;

&quot;If we learned anything tonight it&#146;s that life isn&#146;t fair.&quot;

Fujin choked in shock, she was unprepared for Quistis to be so cold to 
her.

&quot;TALK.&quot; Fujin said again, the pain evident in her strained voice.

&quot;There&#146;s nothing to talk about.&quot;

&quot;QUISTIS.&quot; Fujin called out sadly.

&quot;Just leave.&quot;

&quot;PLEASE.&quot;

&quot;Go away&quot;

Fujin moved her lips as if to speak but nothing came out. With tears 
running down her cheek she turned and fled up the hall. Back inside her 
apartment, Quistis slid down the door completely lost to despair and 
anguish. Her mind screaming at her to call Fujin back. But she knew 
Fujin deserved better than she could give her.

&quot;It&#146;s better this way, you&#146;d only hurt her further.&quot; An unwelcome 
thought claimed.

&quot;But I love her.&quot; She tried to reason.

&quot;Really, is that why you tried to pass her off to Seifer?&quot;

&quot;I thought she loved him still.&quot;

&quot;Liar.&quot;

&quot;I only want what makes her happy.&quot;

&quot;Who are you trying to convince?&quot;

&quot;It was a mistake. She hates me now.&quot;

&quot;She should, you ruined everything.&quot;

&quot;I know, I&#146;m a failure.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s a understatement. But now someone else has paid for it. You&#146;ve 
hurt the only person who ever loved you. Not only that but, now, you&#146;ve 
finally gotten someone killed.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s to late for that.&quot;

&quot;What was I supposed to do, I tried my best.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#146;t good enough. Some instructor, people will hate you for years 
to come. Everyone would&#146;ve been happier if you&#146;d thrown yourself off the 
roof like you planned.&quot;

&quot;But Fujin?&quot;

&quot;But what? You actually think you helped her. She&#146;s more miserable now 
than before. You give her a glimpse of love then ruin everything. How&#146;s 
she supposed to cope now that you&#146;ve dragged her heart into the open, 
only to abandon her.&quot;

&quot;She deserves better.&quot;

&quot;Yes everyone deserves better, you only screwed everything up.&quot;

&quot;Cid is probably going to pull your license. You&#146;ll be lucky if they 
only kick you out of Balamb and not put you on trial for gross 
negligence.

&quot;I&#146;m a failure.&quot;

&quot;Yes and it&#146;s a shame Aeka had to die before you&#146;d admit it.&quot;

Quistis curled into a ball on the floor, her sobs now silent and her 
body trembling. It wasn&#146;t long until sleep took her, but even in her 
dreams she was tormented. Visions of Aeka haunted her. She saw the young 
recruit buried alive, her body torn and broken. Her once joyful face 
twisted into an ugly mask of outrage and suffering as she clawed feebly 
at unforgiving darkness that was her tomb. All the while cursing 
Quistis&#146;s name for abandoning her, abandoning as she did Fujin. Quistis 
turned away to flee only to pause in horror. Now Fujin stood before her, 
naked and frozen in wall of ice, her pale blue lips moving ever so 
slowly.

&quot;Fujin!&quot; Quistis screamed, her fists hammering at the ice weakly. 
Fujin&#146;s features were emotionless and uncaring as she moved to speak.

&quot;I hate you.&quot; She said quietly then shattered into pieces at Quistis&#146;s 
feet.

Quistis screamed in anguish as darkness enveloped her.

***********************

As Selphie took her place in the lunch line and she noticed a silence in 
the air that was downright unsettling. Everyone was talking in hushed 
whispers or not at all. The whole training exercise had turned into a 
nightmare and she knew the fallout from it would be catastrophic.

&quot;Hey girl.&quot; Nicole said quietly, taking a place in line behind her.

&quot;Hey.&quot; Selphie smiled.

&quot;This is some mess huh?&quot; Nicole whispered, looking about. &quot;I hate when 
it gets like this, it&#146;s depressing.&quot; She added with a frown.

&quot;Since when is life, not, depressing around here.&quot; Selphie mumbled with 
a sigh before moving up with the line.

&quot;Yeah, I know what you mean. What do you think Cid will do?&quot; Nicole 
asked curiously.

&quot;What can he do? Aeka&#146;s funeral is to be the day after tomorrow. He 
feels it&#146;s best to get past this as soon as possible.&quot;

&quot;I mean about Squall and Quistis.&quot; Nicole said in a grave tone.

&quot;What about them. Squall&#146;s in charge of all this. Selphie shrugged.

&quot;I heard Royce really tore Quistis a new one, rumors are running about 
that it&#146;s Quistis&#146;s fault that Aeka was killed.&quot; Nicole said sadly.

&quot;Because you&#146;re my friend I&#146;m not going to knock you on your ass.&quot; 
Selphie said icily.

&quot;No, no, no.&quot; Nicole jabbered. &quot;I think their full of it too. The 
problem is Quistis is likely to believe it. You know how she can be 
sometimes, me and Zell were talking about it last night.&quot;

&quot;Look, it was a horrible accident, that&#146;s all. I just hope they don&#146;t 
start blaming each other. All that does is cause more grief, trust me, I 
know.&quot; Selphie said knowingly.

&quot;You&#146;re right, I just hope this doesn&#146;t get too ugly. Quistis looked 
really, really rough last night, I think she needs take a break.&quot; Nicole 
frowned.

&quot;Your wrong, if they try to make her take time off she&#146;ll get it in her 
head that they&#146;re trying to get rid of her and make things worse.&quot; 
Selphie corrected her.

&quot;I guess, your right. Where&#146;s Irvine?&quot; Nicole wondered, looking about 
for the tall cowboy.

&quot;He&#146;s sleeping in, he was at the disciplinary hall early this morning 
securing Seifer.&quot; Selphie said regretfully, she missed him.

&quot;Zell&#146;s out like a light too. He&#146;s taking this pretty well, I honestly 
expected him to be a wreck.&quot; Nice said shamefully.

&quot;Give him some credit, he only panics when he thinks he did something 
wrong and then it usually is.&quot; Selphie said with slight smirk. Nicole 
grinned and nodded.

&quot;By the way, since when is Zell and Fujin such good friends?&quot; Selphie 
asked, making a curious face. &quot;He about had a fit when he found out she 
was alive. It was pretty funny.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;ve no idea, I guess they just hit it off. After the mission she 
seemed kinda down so we tried to invite her over. Of course she turned 
us down.&quot;

&quot;I kinda feel bad about the way I treated her. Even more so after all 
that&#146;s happened and what Seifer did to her. It&#146;s him who should be dead, 
not that poor girl.&quot; Selphie frowned.

&quot;Come on now, you just said don&#146;t be blaming others.&quot; Nicole scolded.

&quot;I know, your right. He&#146;s still a jerk, I don&#146;t care what him and Edea 
have planned. I&#146;ll just be glad when we can get back to normal.&quot; Selphie 
grumbled. Nicole couldn&#146;t agree more.

&quot;I know, you need to relax, stress isn&#146;t good for the baby.&quot; She nodded.

&quot;Since when are you a pediatrician.&quot;

&quot;Hey now, I&#146;m head librarian, you think I don&#146;t read?&quot;

&quot;Touch&eacute;&quot; Selphie smirked.

&quot;Ladies.&quot; Xu nodded, walking past them on the way to the trashcan with 
her tray. Selphie leaned out and grabbed her by the arm.

&quot;Oh Wait!&quot; She called out eagerly.

&quot;Hurry, I&#146;ve got to meet Cid before he goes back to Dollet. Squall&#146;s 
already waiting for him.&quot; Xu said nodding towards a clock on the wall.

&quot;Have you seen Quistis?&quot; Nicole asked and Selphie nodded in agreement.

&quot;Nope, she&#146;s probably sleeping in, she&#146;s taking this pretty hard. Try 
her apartment.&quot;

&quot;I did before I came to lunch, no one answered.&quot;

&quot;Try Fujin then, she may know where she is.&quot; Xu said hurriedly. &quot;I got 
to go, sorry.&quot; She blurted then rushed off.

&quot;I don&#146;t know where ghoul lives!?&quot; Selphie shouted after her but to no 
avail.

&quot;Stop that.&quot; Nicole frowned swatting at her.

&quot;What!?&quot; Selphie balked.

&quot;That ghoul nonsense.&quot;

&quot;Aw poot, I don&#146;t mean anything by it, it&#146;s habit.&quot; Selphie frowned in 
embarrassment.

&quot;We&#146;ll find Rinoa, perhaps she knows where she is. We all need to get 
together and do something, try to lift our spirits.&quot; Nicole smiled 
quaintly.

&quot;It&#146;s a little early for that don&#146;t you think, we&#146;ve a funeral to get 
ready for.&quot; Selphie said skeptically.

&quot;It&#146;s never to early to heal.&quot; Nicole said sagely.

&quot;What are you, a coffee house poet?&quot; Selphie smirked dryly at her as 
Nicole simply smiled.

**********

Unable to sleep, everything seemed dull, and unreal. In less than a week 
the idyllic world Fujin had allowed herself to believe in had turned 
into her worse nightmare. She no longer had the emotional barriers to 
keep the chaos in her heart at bay. Quistis had done to good a job 
opening her up and now she paid the price. She hated the weakness she 
felt as she lay on her bed, face buried in her pillow and crying like 
some overemotional schoolgirl. She cursed herself for allowing herself 
to become so involved, she knew she&#146;d only get hurt. But in her 
loneliness she let herself hope for one last time. To make matters 
harder, Aeka&#146;s death only compounded her sorrow and she felt as though 
she&#146;d go mad.

&quot;STOP!&quot; She hissed angrily through the tears, hoping the sound of her 
own voice would give her strength. The effort was feeble at best and it 
only angered her further. She wanted to know why, why Quistis turned on 
her so. She couldn&#146;t understand and that made it even worse. Sure they&#146;d 
had an argument but she had assumed things would work out. Never did she 
dream it could go so wrong so fast and so completely. Her mind raced to 
try and find answers. Quistis had seemed genuinely glad to see her when 
they where reunited after the explosion but now, now she was harsh and 
cold. Forcing herself to sit up she felt like running, running away from 
everything, the pain, the loss, to leave it all behind.

&quot;NO.&quot; She growled, throwing the pillow across her room. Sniffing 
bitterly she wiped her face and looked about with a scowl. She wouldn&#146;t 
let it end like this. Nearly in a panic she paced about, trying to think 
of any reason for Quistis to treat her so.

&quot;IDIOT!&quot; She blurted and she stopped her pacing.

&quot;She&#146;s trying to protect me.&quot; She realized with a start and immediately 
grew angry as the implications sank in. She was even angrier with 
herself for not realizing what was happening sooner. It was like Zell 
had said; Quistis was trying to blame herself and now she was pushing 
everyone away to keep from hurting them. Fujin made up her mind; she was 
not about to let Quistis sabotage herself again like she had tried so 
many times before. Stripping down, she hurried to take a shower, a plan 
already forming in her mind.

***********************

Dr. Kadowaki walked into the morgue with a heavy heart. Aeka was laid 
the operating table draped with a white sheet. Royce was in a seat by 
her side, sound asleep. The doctor sighed and looked over her papers, 
the girl was to be cremated. Gently she touched Royce&#146;s shoulder to wake 
him. His eyes fluttered and he looked up slowly, his expression void.

&quot;It&#146;s time?&quot; He asked quietly.

&quot;Yes.&quot; The doctor whispered.

&quot;When are the services?&quot;

&quot;In two days.&quot;

&quot;What&#146;s to happen to her?&quot; He mumbled softly.

&quot;She wanted to be cremated and cast to the ocean.&quot; Dr. Kadowaki 
explained in a gentle tone.

&quot;Okay.&quot; Royce nodded slowly and stood. &quot;I&#146;ll be going now.&quot; He said then 
looked up with a frown. Quistis stood in the doorway; she looked 
disheveled and unkempt. Ignoring his gaze she moved forward towards the 
table. Dr. Kadowaki intercepted her carefully.

&quot;Don&#146;t do this to yourself Quisty.&quot; She whispered.

&quot;I need to see her.&quot; Quistis said dully. &quot;To apologize.&quot;

Royce groaned and looked at his feet.

&quot;Miss Trepe.&quot; He said heavily but she didn&#146;t hear him. All she could 
hear was Aeka pleading for her to save her, not to abandon her.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry.&quot; She choked weakly.

&quot;Miss Trepe, I.&quot; Royce said hoarsely, having to fight back tears. &quot;I 
didn&#146;t mean to blame you, it&#146;s not your fault. If anything it&#146;s my 
fault, I caused the explosion...&quot; He paused and took a deep shuttering 
breath. &quot;It&#146;s my fault I killed her, not you.&quot; He said weakly.

&quot;NONSENSE.&quot; Fujin said firmly, from where she&#146;d been waiting in an 
adjoining room. She knew Quistis would come eventually and there was 
something she needed to get off her chest about how everyone acting.

&quot;Fujin?&quot; Royce said in confusion as she walked towards them. Quistis 
looked up and slumped visibly, she had not wanted to see her now.

Dr. Kadowaki was about to protest but Fujin cut her a chilling look.

&quot;SICK AND TIRED.&quot; Fujin started and took a breath.

&quot;WISH YOU KICKED HER OUT?&quot; She continued seemingly upset. &quot;THINK SHE 
WEAK THEN&quot;

Quistis was taken aback. &quot;I...&quot; She said quietly, humbled.

&quot;SHOULD BE PROUD.&quot; Fujin snapped. &quot;NOT BLAME SELF.&quot; She coughed harshly 
but continued. &quot;TAUGHT HER WELL.&quot;

&quot;But she died.&quot; Quistis said weakly, Fujin sighed and shook her head 
sadly.

&quot;PEOPLE DIE.&quot; She said with a gentle bluntness. &quot;SHE NOT WANT THIS.&quot; She 
frowned, gesturing to Aeka. &quot;SPREADING BLAME.&quot;

&quot;WANTED TO BE STRONG LIKE YOU.&quot; She put her hands on Quistis shoulders 
and looked her in the eye. &quot;BE STRONG FOR HER. MOURN YES, BUT BE STRONG. 
She finished then collapsed into a fit of harsh coughing. Royce listened 
intently, a heavy sense of shame hanging over him. With a sigh he took a 
step forward.

&quot;She&#146;s right.&quot; He said quietly.

&quot;You belittle why she died if you blame yourself. She only wanted to 
make you proud. I think she earned it. Let her go knowing that.&quot;

Quistis trembled and moved forward, gently she knelt by Aeka and sighed 
sadly.

&quot;You&#146;re both right.&quot; She murmured. &quot;She has.&quot;

Fujin regained herself and rubbed her throat. Smiling fondly she looked 
down at where Aeka lay.

&quot;MISS YOU.&quot; She whispered, gently touching the girl&#146;s shoulder. Turning 
she looked at Quistis and Royce. Having said her peace she moved past 
them and out into the waiting room. A few minutes past before Quistis 
and Royce followed her. Royce looked up Quistis humbly.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry for what I said. It&#146;s just that I..&quot; He tried to say but 
Quistis silenced him by pulled him into a warm hug.

&quot;It&#146;s okay. We&#146;ll all get through this.&quot; She said in a quiet motherly 
tone. She held him for a long while before letting him go. &quot;Now then.&quot; 
She sniffed. &quot;Go clean up and get something to eat.&quot; She added with a 
tender smile before ushering him on. Fujin watched the exchange quietly 
and waited for Royce to leave before stepping forward.

&quot;NEED TALK.&quot; She said firmly

Quistis sighed heavily and walked past her and out of the office. Fujin 
frowned and hurried after her.

&quot;KNOW WHAT DOING.&quot; She said with a cough as she caught up with her in 
the hall.

&quot;Please Fujin it&#146;s for the best, I appreciate what you said in there, 
and you&#146;re right, but.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin said angrily, grabbing her by the arm to stop her. 
Quistis paused and looked at her guiltily.

&quot;I&#146;d only hurt you.&quot; She said in a quiet tortured tone. Fujin let her go 
and shook her head.

&quot;ALREADY HAVE.&quot; She sighed. &quot;PLEASE, NOT AGAIN.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s not going to work hon, I&#146;m damaged goods, I&#146;ve ruined everything. 
My students, my career, and most of all, I&#146;ve ruined us.&quot;

&quot;NO YOU HAVEN&#146;T&quot;

&quot;Why are you doing this, it&#146;ll only hurt you more.&quot; Quistis whimpered.

&quot;You need to ask?&quot; Fujin whispered in shock.

Quistis was mortified with herself. Shaking her head with tears in her 
eyes she took a step back. Fujin looked down and bit her lip as she 
composed herself. Finally she looked up, her features trembling softly 
as she tried to keep herself in check.

&quot;Do you love me?&quot; She asked, her voice small and barely audible. Quistis 
looked torn and confused as she choked to hold back further tears.

&quot;Yes.&quot; She finally murmured, her shoulders slumping as she gave in to 
her sorrow and self-loathing. Fujin moved forward to embrace her as 
Quistis collapsed against her chest crying softly. With a shuttering 
sigh Fujin looked and squeezed her comfortably.

&quot;I don&#146;t know what to do anymore.&quot; Quistis whispered between sobs. &quot;I&#146;m 
scared.&quot;

Fujin nuzzled her hair and murmured soothingly to her.

&quot;What am I to do?&quot; Quistis asked softly.

&quot;REST.&quot; Fujin smiled and led her away.

*******************

The day past slowly and everyone seemed to move about in dreamlike 
state. It was well past midnight when Balamb Garden arrived in Esthar.

&quot;Love.&quot; Edea said softly. Cid turned in his seat to face her and smiled 
sadly.

&quot;I know, is it time?&quot; He asked, his expression full of worry.

&quot;Yes. We&#146;ve arrived at Esthar and I fear it won&#146;t be long.&quot; Edea said 
tiling her head thoughtfully at him.

&quot;You know they&#146;ll fight this?&quot; Cid said slowly, his heart growing heavy.

Edea moved forward and caressed his cheek.

&quot;I know, but it must be done.&quot; Edea whispered dreamily and kissed him 
tenderly. Cid welcomed the gesture and smiled regretfully.

&quot;Come then, before I change my mind.&quot; He sighed.

&quot;My brave husband.&quot; She smiled and took his hand.

Together, they walked out onto the bridge. Squall and the other senior 
members waited quietly along with Fujin and Rinoa. Cid looked to Quistis 
and frowned sympathetically.

&quot;You don&#146;t have to come.&quot; He said gently.

&quot;Yes I do.&quot; Quistis said firmly.

&quot;We all do.&quot; Rinoa added.

&quot;Very well, lets get this over with.&quot; Cid sighed.

***********************

Seifer sat in his cell motionless. His cold eyes staring into the 
darkness, his only companion being the ceiling fan that hummed dully 
overhead.

&quot;I am ready.&quot; He said quietly, his hands, resting on his knees were 
white as chalk and a fine sheen of sweat was beading on his brow.

&quot;No one came to see me.&quot; He thought solemnly.

&quot;I am not afraid.&quot; He said aloud.

&quot;I wonder if she will mourn me.&quot;

&quot;I knew it would come to this someday.&quot;

&quot;Will any of them?&quot;

&quot;This is for the best.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m sorry.&quot;

He could hear Griever clawing madly at his sub-consciousness and closed 
his eyes to concentrate. The door to his cell opened and he looked up.

&quot;Lets do it.&quot; He said with a smirk as Squall entered the room.

&quot;It&#146;s not to late.&quot; Squall said shaking his head.

&quot;I appreciate what you&#146;re trying to do.&quot; Seifer smirked and clapped him 
on the shoulder. &quot;But it was too late for me years ago. Let me do 
something right for once.&quot; He said, moving past him. Squall stuck out 
his arm and stopped him.

&quot;Seifer.&quot; He said quietly and offered his hand. &quot;Good luck.&quot;

Seifer looked at the hand questioningly; then, with a grin shook it.</pre>
