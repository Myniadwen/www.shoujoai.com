Calm before the storm.

It was late when Fujin left Quistis&#146;s apartment, they had spent the 
better part of the evening going over what she would need in order 
resume her classes. She couldn&#146;t help but frown in dismay upon coming 
face to face with Zell and Irvine in the hall.

&quot;Ah hell when did you get back?&quot; Zell asked as his expression darkened.

Fujin eyed him warily as she brushed past him before stalking up the 
hall without a second glance.

&quot;Rude little lady that one.&quot; Irvine shrugged.

&quot;You didn&#146;t have put up with her while growing up.&quot; Zell scowled as he 
knocked on Quistis&#146;s door.

&quot;Kinda cute though.&quot; Irvine watched her leave appreciatively.

&quot;Ugh dude she&#146;s a bitch.&quot;

&quot;Still cute.&quot; He smirked.

&quot;Whatever.&quot; Zell knocked again.

Quistis opened the door cautiously and poked her head out.

&quot;What? Oh hey guys, what&#146;s up?&quot; She asked curiously.

&quot;Well me and Kinneas here just got back from seeing Lords of Blood and 
the Skull King.&quot; Zell said merrily.

&quot;It&#146;s a gripping tale.&quot; Irvine joked.

&quot;Sounds positively riveting.&quot; Quistis droned.

&quot;We ran into Xu and Nida there and they said you was on probation or 
something so we wanted to ask what&#146;s up?&quot; Zell folded his arms and 
waited.

Quistis sighed.

&quot;Give me a moment I need to get dressed.&quot;

&quot;Sure thing.&quot; Zell replied as Irvine bobbed and bounced trying to sneak 
a peek as she shut the door in their faces.

Irvine grinned lewdly then looked up the hall.

&quot;Interesting?&quot; He said smilingly.

&quot;Dude your like dating someone, remember.&quot; Zell looked at him with 
grimly.

&quot;Ah she&#146;s a hotty and you know it.&quot;

&quot;Dude! She&#146;s like a sister or something.&quot; Zell elbowed him and shivered.

&quot;Yeah, yeah alright. Puzzle me this then my friend. What was Fujin doing 
there?&quot; Irvine thumbed up the hall.

&quot;Beats me, it&#146;s none of my business what that Ghoul does so long as she 
stays the hell away from me.&quot;

&quot;Yeah well, two cute gals and one of them naked makes is the stuff of 
dreams &quot;Irvine said with an obviously vulgar undertone.

&quot;DUDE!&quot; Zell clamped his hands over his ears. &quot;That! Is so very wrong! 
Shut up before you creep me out.&quot;

&quot;Ah live a little.&quot; Irvine laughed.

&quot;You.... You&#146;re twisted.&quot; Zell shoved him playfully.

&quot;Hey now don&#146;t ruffle the merchandise.&quot; Irvine said indignantly as he 
smoothed his coat out.

Quistis opened the door. Irvine winked and whistled at her jokingly, 
prompting her to eye him sourly.

&quot;Your disgusting Irvine Kinneas.&quot; She said bluntly and motioned them 
inside.

&quot;Hey I resent that. Pretty lady like you shouldn&#146;t be so rude.&quot; He 
responded and smiled a dashing smile.

&quot;Please, spare me the melodramatics.&quot; She grinned over her shoulder as 
she went to the couch.

Zell laughed.

&quot;Sorry about the wait, I was getting ready to take a shower.&quot; She 
apologized as she sat down.

&quot;No probs Quisty.&quot; Zell hoped onto the opposite couch and propped his 
feet on the coffee table. Irvine sauntered down beside him.

&quot;Well spill the beans Teach.&quot; Zell said excitedly. &quot;They&#146;re not really 
pulling you license again are they!?&quot;

&quot;Well Xu would love nothing better I think, Squalls staying out of it 
best he can, Cid though is deciding to review my case and then give me 
an answer. Till then I have the next week off.&quot; She&#146;d decided not to 
worry herself sick over the matter and sighed helplessly.

&quot;Whoa! That sucks ass.&quot; Zell frowned.

&quot;Sorry Quisty that&#146;s a raw deal, but at least you still have a chance.&quot; 
Irvine said as he leaned over to look at the pile of textbooks and 
papers atop the coffee table near Zell&#146;s feet.

&quot;Burning the midnight oil again eh.&quot; Irvine joked as he thumbed through 
one of the textbooks.

&quot;Oh I pulled those out to help Fujin get back into the SEED program.&quot; 
Quistis said idly.

Irvine looked at Zell and winced as the blonde youth exploded in shock.

&quot;WHAT!? Are you out of your frigging mind woman!?&quot; He shouted in 
surprise.

Quistis looked shocked and a bit insulted that he would take that tone 
with her. Irvine shrugged sheepishly and buried his nose in the book.

&quot;Zell? What the hell was that about?&quot; Quistis said defensively.

&quot;Sorry for yelling you just shocked me is all. You know I have no love 
for Ghoul, or did you forget she held my hometown hostage. It was bad 
enough when you guys let her back in Balamb but now this.&quot; Zell said, 
throwing his hands in the air in frustration.

&quot;She&#146;s not a Ghoul Zell.&quot; Quistis said with a glimmer of anger.

&quot;Yeah, yeah I hear ya teach. Well I trust your decision, I may not like 
it but you know what your doing I guess.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;This mean I have 
to be nice to her?&quot;

&quot;Zell have you ever thought about trying to talk to her about it?&quot; 
Quistis sighed as she went to the kitchen.

&quot;Yeah Zell you and her could become best friends.&quot; Irvine guffawed at 
the thought.

&quot;Eh up yours cowpoke.&quot; Zell grunted.

&quot;You BOYS want something to drink?&quot; Quistis asked as she pulled a few 
sodas from the refrigerator.

&quot;Yes Ma&#146; am&quot; Zell piped up.

&quot;I&#146;m good.&quot; Irvine declined politely.

&quot;Zell did I mention you make me feel about forty every time you call me 
Ma&#146;am?&quot; Quistis said as she handed him his drink then sat back down. 
Irvine smiled and settled back comfortable on the couch.

&quot;Fujin eh, she&#146;s a cutie be glad to see her around more.&quot; Irvine smiled 
hugely.

&quot;Oh geeze.&quot; Zell shook his head.

&quot;Irvine please control yourself. Your far more appealing when you&#146;re not 
trying to be.&quot;

&quot;Shamed.&quot; Zell shouted laughingly.

&quot;She says that now.&quot; Irvine gave Quistis a knowing wink.

&quot;Your hopeless.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;So teach, do you think you&#146;ll be able to keep teaching?&quot; Zell asked her 
with a concerned look.

&quot;Only time will tell honestly.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;I hope so, I&#146;d hate to 
loose the position but I&#146;ll do what they feel is best for my students.&quot; 
She sighed and smiled regretfully.

&quot;It&#146;ll be okay Quisty, trust me.&quot; Irvine said brightly and stood up. 
&quot;Come on Zell lets let the little lady get her shower.&quot; Zell stood and 
smirked.

&quot;Yeah Quistis it&#146;ll be fine, even if we have to beat some sense into Xu 
and Cid ourselves.&quot; He did a little flurry of punches to emphasize the 
point.

&quot;Hopefully it won&#146;t come to that, you two.&quot; Quistis laughed as she 
escorted them to the door.

&quot;Well goodnight hope you have fun if you decide to actually go anywhere 
on vacation.&quot; Zell said as he stepped out into the hall.

&quot;Night Zell thanks for stopping by. She smiled fondly.

Irvine stuck his head back in the door puckering his lips.

&quot;Do I get a good night kiss?&quot; He whined with a goofy look.

&quot;Go home Irvine.&quot; Quistis laughed as she shut the door.

********************

Fujin lay in her bed; her gaze locked somewhere between realities as she 
thought about the paths she had chosen. Things where very different now, 
she was different now. For the first time in as long as she could 
remember she trusted someone, even come to care for someone who to her 
surprise returned the feelings fully. She smiled at the thought of 
Quistis and, how gentle and caring she was. So unlike anyone else who&#146;d 
ever mattered in her life. It was a welcome change Fujin thought, though 
she could tell Quistis was still treading carefully, not wanting to risk 
breaking their fragile relationship. Fujin was thankful for that, 
everything was new and frightening to her.

This was a challenge she never prepared for, but she was willing to try 
and face it. Quistis had come to mean a great deal to her lately, true 
she was a friend, but there was more to it than that. She may be 
inexperienced in all things social, but even she could feel the tension 
between them and it was intoxicating, she didn&#146;t know how to express it 
or even if she should. Confusion clouded her mind and she rolled over in 
annoyance, burying her head in her pillow with a sigh.

She curled up shivered faintly in remembrance of the night before. 
Quistis had fallen asleep in her arms. Fujin remembered her scent, the 
comforting warmth of her body pressed against hers. Quistis&#146;s delicate 
softness lay in delicious contrast to her own tone, firm frame. She 
remembered looking into her eyes, those entrancing pools of crystal blue 
that called to her like a siren song, she could have given herself to 
them, to her.

Fujin gasped at the thoughts that flooded her mind. Seductive and 
passionate, unlike anything she could have imagined. Her body responded 
as well and she felt warm all over, she was in shock that her mind would 
betray her so. Sitting up abruptly wiped her forehead, a cool sheen of 
sweat covered her skin. She exhaled slowly and trembled, she was 
startled at the new sensations her body was sending her. She stood and 
started to slip out of her clothes, as she felt the urgent need for a 
cool shower.</pre>
