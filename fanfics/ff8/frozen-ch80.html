ah, ah you can&#39;t see my eyes

you can&#39;t see my eyes

and they don&#39;t see yours

hear me when I say I don&#39;t mind at all

it&#39;s the rain that I hear coming

not a stranger or a ghost it&#39;s the quiet of a storm approaching

that I fear the most it&#39;s the pain that I hear coming

the slightest crystal teardrops to the ground

in silence when my love is near

darling when did you fall when was it over

darling when, when did you fall when was it over

it&#39;s marching through my door now the stony cold of lonesome

a bell tolls for my heart and then my lonesome song begins

it&#39;s marching through my door now the stony cold of lonesome

a bell tolls for my heart and then my lonesome song begins

darling when did you cry I couldn&#39;t hear you

darling when, when did you cry I couldn&#39;t hear you

I suppose it is the price of falling in love (I suppose it is the price 
of falling in love)

I suppose it is the price of falling in love (I suppose it is the price 
of falling in love)

ah, ah it&#39;s the rain that I hear coming

not a stranger not a ghost the quiet of a storm approaching

that I fear the most it&#39;s the pain that I hear coming

the slightest crystal tear drops to the ground

in silence when my love is near

it&#39;s marching through my door now the stony cold of lonesome

a bell tolls for my heart and now my lonesome song will end

darling when did we fall when was it over, darling when,

when did we fall when was it over

I suppose it is the price of falling in love

I fear that it&#39;s the price of falling in love

I fear that it&#39;s the price of falling in love

I fear that it&#39;s the price of falling in love

I fear that it&#39;s the price of falling in love



When did you fall...?

With a gentle hand Fujin gentle caressed Quistis&#39; cheek. For six months 
she&#39;d been in a coma, brought on by the grievous wounds she suffered in 
the collapse of the stairwell. For six months Fujin had stayed by her 
side, caring for her in ways far to intimate to be left to well-meaning 
nurses and the like. Bathing her, brushing her hair, and keeping her 
limbs exercised as best as possible to stem of atrophy. She even read to 
her, or chatted idly, or reminisced. At first she felt foolish, carrying 
a one sided conversation in her own stilted way. But over time she&#39;d 
grown used to it and even enjoyed it, knowing somewhere deep down, 
Quistis could hear her and wouldn&#39;t be so alone. At first, people 
visited all the time, but as time progressed, the visits shortened until 
only one or two people would come every few days. Selphie and Zell 
mostly.

Squall, unable to truly accept what had happened, visited the least. 
Fujin didn&#39;t blame him though, or any of them. People tend to shy away 
from things that remind them of death, and for all intents and purposes, 
Quistis was just that. Doctor Kadowaki had explained that even with the 
magically charged healing process&#39;s and the best care, Quistis had a 
slim chance of recovery. Too much time had past before Squall and the 
others were able to find them. Even Fujin&#39;s own wounds troubled her to 
this day, but she was at least expected to make a full recovery, in 
time.

Some thought it would be best to do what needed to be done and let 
Quistis go, and that prolonging her life in such a state was cruel. 
Fujin&#39;s response had been catastrophic. As long as Quistis was in no 
pain, and there remained the slightest hope, she refused to give up on 
her. And so she worked, she worked hard, to the point of ignoring her 
own recovery needs. During the times Doctor Kadowaki would come to check 
on Quistis, she would scold Fujin about going without sleep or food for 
long stretches at a time. Of course, Fujin ignored her, staying focused 
on caring for her fallen lover.

&quot;miss you...&quot; Fujin whispered softly, as she pulled out a brush to 
gently comb through Quistis&#39; hair. She was pale, and gaunt, a ghost of 
her former self. Fujin made sure to be optimistic and cheerful while in 
her presence, but when she left for errands and such, the weight of what 
she was enduring showed heavily on her.

A gentle knock on the door caused her to turn and frown. She had hoped 
to have some time alone so soon after the move from where Quistis had 
been kept while Balamb was restored.

&quot;YES?&quot; She asked brightly. &quot;Cheerful, always cheerful.&quot; She reminded 
herself.

&quot;It&#39;s me, sorry to come by so late. I figured you two would want time to 
settle in.&quot; Doctor Kadowaki said as she opened the door.

&quot;IS OKAY.&quot; Fujin nodded and moved out of the way as the Doctor 
approached.

&quot;How&#39;s she doin?&quot; Kadowaki asked chattily, even though she knew the 
answer.

&quot;GLAD TO BE HOME.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s good.&quot; The doctor smiled as she went about giving Quistis her 
daily check up. &quot;You look tired.&quot; She noted, glancing over to Fujin who 
watched protectively from nearby.

&quot;UP ALL NIGHT.&quot;

&quot;So I hear. I also heard about...&quot; She started and Fujin&#39;s features 
darkened. &quot;Anyway...&quot; The doctor continued. &quot;Do get some sleep, and I 
brought you dinner. It&#39;s out front.&quot; She nodded towards the front desk 
of the infirmary.

&quot;THANK YOU.&quot; Fujin smiled graciously.

&quot;Oh here.&quot; Kadowaki paused, fished in her pockets to retrieve a key. 
&quot;I&#39;m about to leave for the night so I made you a copy of the key.&quot; She 
explained, tossing it to Fujin. She caught it, nodding graciously then 
slipped it on her key chain. Fujin had taken to staying all night with 
Quistis in Esthar and it was a tradition that was expected to continue 
now that they had moved back to Balamb.

&quot;WELL?&quot; Fujin asked as Kadowaki finished the short exam.

&quot;All things considered, she looks good, you&#39;re doing a wonderful job.&quot; 
Kadowaki smiled then headed for the door.

&quot;You need anything else?&quot; She asked before leaving.

&quot;NEG...NO.&quot; Fujin smiled.

&quot;Alright then, you have a good night.&quot;

&quot;WE SHALL.&quot; Fujin responded, walking her out.

After they were alone, Fujin took the plate of food the good doctor had 
graciously prepared and walked back and sat at Quistis&#39; side. Quietly 
she peeled back the foil from the plate and sighed, savoring the smell. 
Kadowaki had apparently went the extra mile, preparing steamed 
vegetables, steak, and rolls.

&quot;NICE OF HER.&quot; Fujin mumbled contently, glancing over to Quistis, who 
breathed quietly next to her. Frowning slightly, Fujin sniffed and 
started to eat.

**************************

&quot;I&#39;m home!&quot; Zell shouted brightly, bounding into the apartment. Nicole, 
Celest, Zone and Watts looked up startled by his rowdy entrance. 
Gleefully, Nicole hopped up and greeted him warmly.

&quot;How did it go?&quot; She asked brightly.

&quot;Our newlyweds are on their way.&quot; He grinned, then waved at the others 
who sat around a table chattering to themselves.

&quot;You folks aren&#39;t going to tear up my place again are you?&quot; Zell asked, 
walking towards them.

&quot;Not out fault.&quot; Zone grumbled quietly.

Ica, snorted from her perch. The small dragon obviously didn&#39;t agree 
with him. Zone cut the creature a sideways look then looked back to 
regard the others. His vision wandered to Celest and he immediately 
blushed, before looking away awkwardly. The low cut shirt she wore 
showed just enough of her cleavage to give him fits, and his stomach, 
already roiling, caused him to burp slightly.

&quot;Aw geeze Zone...&quot; Watts sighed, looking up.

&quot;Excuse me...&quot; Zone groaned sourly.

&quot;Lordy sugar you shouldn&#39;t have had those extra helpings of casserole.&quot; 
Celest laughed, fishing about in her purse. &quot;Here boy, before you burst 
or something.&quot; She chuckled, handing him a bottle of antacids.

&quot;Thanks...&quot; Zone responded, his voice barely audible.

&quot;Yeah well...okay then...&quot; Zell said with shrug, as he sat down. &quot;What 
are we up to kiddies?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re about to catch a film down in the commons area.&quot; Watts offered 
brightly.

&quot;The theater is ready? I didn&#39;t think they&#39;d have it built yet, kick 
ass!&quot; Zell said excitedly.

&quot;Yup, since they were restoring everything Cid told them to go ahead and 
complete it too.&quot; Nicole grinned.

&quot;Speaking of which, we&#39;re gonna be late if we don&#39;t hurry.&quot; Celest said 
sternly, rising to her feet then paused. &quot;Oh, oh!&quot; She said excitedly as 
she switched into gossip mode.

&quot;What?&quot; Nicole asked curiously.

&quot;Did you hear about Seifer!&quot; Celest answered with a giggle.

&quot;Oh boy...&quot; Zell sighed.

&quot;No, what about him?&quot; Nicole asked.

&quot;He showed up late last night after the party. He and Fujin got into it 
big time, I mean, she almost killed him.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Zell blurted, shocked by the news.

&quot;What happened? Is he okay?&quot; Nicole asked.

&quot;Oh yeah, he&#39;s fine, Xu let him out of the detention block this morning. 
The jerk grabbed my ass.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t believe it.&quot; Zell mouthed.

&quot;You better believe, he got himself a handful, the pervert.&quot; Celest 
pouted.

&quot;I&#39;m not talking about your butt.&quot; Zell sighed. &quot;Where&#39;s Fujin? Is she 
okay?&quot;

&quot;I talked to her this morning actually.&quot; Nicole answered. &quot;Um... she 
seemed fine, even tried to engage in small talk. It was kinda weird.&quot; 
She grinned sheepishly.

&quot;Oh hey, maybe that&#146;s a good sign!&quot; Zell smiled broadly.

&quot;Who knows.&quot; Nicole grinned, then looked at the clock. &quot;Well come on 
guys we&#39;re gonna be late.&quot;

&quot;What are we seeing anyway?&quot; Zell asked as the exited the apartment.

&quot;Phantom Invaders ate my brains.&quot; Zone said cheerfully.

&quot;What, are you serious...&quot; Zell grinned, looking at Nicole curiously.

&quot;We let him choose...&quot; She explained with a helpless sigh.

&quot;Oh...&quot; Zell nodded.

&quot;I hope this ones as good as the last six.&quot; Zone chattered excitedly as 
they made their way up the hall.

************************

Fujin lay quietly on a fold out cot next to Quistis&#39; bed; it was 
uncomfortable but far more practical than hauling another bed into the 
small room. Besides, it was a minor annoyance and she&#39;d long ago learned 
to ignore it. In the darkness, she watched over her wounded love, her 
face illuminated by the rhythmically flashing lights of the life support 
machines. Up until recently Quistis had been breathing on her own until 
one dreadful morning not to long ago she had a massive seizure and 
stopped breathing. Not wishing to take any chances, Doctor Kadowaki saw 
fit to hook her to a respirator, at least while she ran tests to see 
what was wrong.

Fujin didn&#39;t want to think about it. Letting her self drift into a 
shallow sleep. Over the months, she found that she hardly dreamt 
anymore, and the slightest noises would wake her up in a near panic out 
of fear for Quistis&#39; safety. It was some hours before she awoke with a 
start and looked around blearily. It was dark outside, looking to the 
clock mounted on the wall, she found it was early in the morning, well 
before sunrise.

Sitting up, she rubbed her face groggily then glanced over to Quistis, 
who lay as always, still and unresponsive. To this day Fujin would wake 
and think it had all been a horrible dream, but to her regret, it was 
never so. Instead, she once again awoke alone.

&quot;MORNING.&quot; Fujin said with as much cheer as she could manage. Leaning 
over Quistis&#39; prone form kissed her forehead gently. With a sigh she 
then went to the closet to retrieve a couple of towels and sponges, it 
was bath time.

******************************

&quot;Zell...&quot; Nicole whispered quietly as the early rays of the morning sun 
crept into their room. Zell stirred a moment then turned to face her, 
with one squinty eye open.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; He mumbled.

&quot;I love you.&quot; She said quietly.

&quot;Wha?&quot; Zell frowned, waking up fully, something was wrong.

&quot;Nothing. I&#39;m sorry, go back to sleep.&quot; She sighed, patting his shoulder 
gently as he started to sit up.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; He frowned worriedly. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;

Nicole smiled fondly at him and nodded.

&quot;I&#39;m okay, I just had a bad dream is all.&quot;

&quot;Oh...You want to talk about?&quot; He asked softly.

She shrugged slightly then relented.

&quot;It was about Quistis.... I dreamt she died.&quot; She said quietly, as if 
saying it aloud would somehow make it reality. He pulled her into his 
arms and hugged her tightly.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve had those too.&quot; He frowned. &quot;It&#39;s just dreams though...&quot;

&quot;Would you take care of me...?&quot; She asked timidly.

&quot;Always.&quot;

&quot;Even if I was like that...&quot;

&quot;Especially then.&quot; He said firmly.

&quot;Poor Fujin, to have to face that day after day... alone...&quot;

&quot;We tried to help her, you know that.&quot;

&quot;I know, I just wished she&#39;d let us help. I feel so helpless sometimes. 
I mean Quisty is our friend too.&quot;

&quot;I understand, but you have to realize something. Quistis has lost 
everything, she&#39;s helpless right not and Fujin is trying to let her keep 
the only thing she has left, her dignity.&quot; He explained quietly.

&quot;I guess you&#39;re right.&quot; Nicole sighed, looking down sorrowfully.

&quot;Quistis is in good hands, it&#39;s Fujin we need to worry about.&quot; He 
frowned. &quot;You said she tried to talk to you yesterday. Who knows, 
perhaps she&#39;ll be okay.&quot;

&quot;I hope so, I really do.&quot; She sighed quietly.

*************************

Groggily, Celest staggered out of her bedroom amid sounds of snoring. 
Looking into the living room saw Zone sprawled out like a dead chicken 
on the couch. She&#39;d made the mistake of inviting him over for a nightcap 
after the movie. It was more a gesture of goodwill. He&#39;d been trying so 
hard to win her over. They drank and talked, which meant she talked and 
he drank, that was, until he passed out.

&quot;Sheesh...&quot; Celest sighed shaking her head as she staggered to the 
kitchen for a cup of water. A rather loud snort from her houseguest 
startled her into a giggle. He was a nice guy, in a skulking, kind of 
way, even if he was prone to letting his eyes wander when talking to her 
and she didn&#39;t even want to think about what was up with his irritable 
bowel which seemed downright hostile at times.

With a sigh she walked over to where he slept and leaned over. She 
watched him a moment, thinking to herself. Then, leaning over slowly she 
opened her lips to speak.

&quot;UP AND AT EM!&quot; She shouted instead, her eyes dancing with mischief.

Zone thrashed in fright, sending his blanket flying into the air like an 
angry poltergeist. Celest was promptly smacked in the flailing by his 
flailing and he fell off the couch while she staggered back from the 
blow, holding her mouth and cursing under her breath.

&quot;What! What happened!!&quot; Zone yelped, sitting up wide-eyed.

&quot;You cretin you hit me!&#39; Celest wailed.

&quot;I did?&quot; He gawked, growing flush. &quot;Oh Hyne! I&#39;m sorry!&quot; He babbled, 
scrambling to his feet to help her.

&quot;I&#39;m fine!&#39; Celest snapped, slapping him away irritably.

Zone flushed with embarrassment and backed up.

&quot;Um.... Well...Sorry...&quot; He mumbled.

&quot;Yeah, me too.&quot; Celest sighed, going into the bathroom to check on the 
damage. With a frown Zone sheepishly went for his coat and was about to 
the door when Celest stopped him

&quot;Where are you goin?&quot; She asked curiously, rubbing her jaw.

&quot;Um...leaving...&quot; He answered quietly, not daring to turn around.

&quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;Um...sorry again...I&#39;ll um....bye...&quot; He sighed, then reached for the 
door.

&quot;So you&#39;re just goin leave.&quot; She grumbled in mock disgust. &quot;You assault 
me then you don&#39;t even take me to breakfast to make it up. Fine then, go 
on you big jerk.&quot;

Zone flinched and turned around.

&quot;Huh?&quot; He said awkwardly.

&quot;Oh for the love of.&quot; Celest laughed. &quot;You&#39;re too uptight son, learn to 
relax. It was just an accident.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Sit down you goof. Let me clean up and we&#39;ll go eat.&quot; She chuckled.

&quot;Um sure!&quot; He smiled broadly, hurrying back to the couch.

************************

As had been usual for her of late Fujin ate alone. That is, whenever she 
decided to eat in public and not in her room. The cafeteria was a hub of 
activity, more so than usual since Balamb&#39;s residents were once again 
reunited under one roof instead of scattered throughout Esthar.

She watched everyone mull about and chatter, her thoughts idle but never 
far from the love of her life who lay waiting for her return. 
Unexpectedly, Zell and Nicole sat down on either side of her. Both 
offered a smile and said nothing. Fujin glanced to each of them 
curiously. She was tempted to leave but fought it.

&quot;MORNING.&quot; She finally said in an awkward, unsure manner. She wasn&#39;t 
used to talking to them, much less without Quistis nearby. She never 
realized how much strength and courage she&#39;d given her socially.

&quot;Hey.&quot; Zell smiled, grotesquely while wolfing down one hotdog after 
another.

&quot;Oh, please don&#39;t talk with your mouthful...&quot; Nicole sighed, then looked 
to Fujin apologetically. &quot;Excuse him, he&#39;s retarded.&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot; Fujin found herself agreeing, causing Nicole to giggle 
and Zell to make sounds of protest. Startled at how easy the brief 
moment of levity had come, Fujin quickly resumed eating, at look of 
disappointment on her face.

Nicole glanced to Zell, who shrugged helplessly.

&quot;So, um, how&#39;s everything going. You get moved back in?&quot; Nicole asked 
quietly after a short period of silence. Fujin merely nodded.

&quot;That&#146;s good. We were wondering if we could come by and visit.&quot;

Again, Fujin said nothing but simply nodded.

&quot;Howdy folks, Celest said cheerfully.&quot; Bounding to the table and sitting 
down loudly with her tray.

&quot;Oh um sorry.&quot; She gulped, finding herself sitting across from Fujin. 
&quot;Am I interrupting something?&quot; She asked, staring to rise again.

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Nicole smiled.

Zone sat down next to Celest and Zell looked at him suspiciously.

&quot;Where&#39;s Watts, you two are usually inseparable?&quot;

&quot;Uh well...&quot; Zone mumbled but Celest interrupted him.

&quot;He stayed over at my place.&quot; She said in a nonchalant manner.

Fujin arched a brow as Nicole went wide-eyed, while Zell and Zone both 
choked.

&quot;Oh my...&quot; Nicole breathed.

&quot;Well.... Er...&quot; Zell babbled.

With a catty grin, Celest threw and arm around Zone and hugged him 
merrily. Causing him to sputter incoherently.

&quot;GOING NOW.&quot; Fujin said, not wishing to be part of whatever gossip was 
about to ensue.

&quot;Oh wait.&quot; Nicole said, grabbing her arm gently.

Fujin looked down curiously.

&quot;We were wondering if we could come visit.&quot; Nicole smiled hopefully as 
Zell nodded eagerly.

&quot;VERY WELL.&quot; Fujin nodded.

&quot;Um excuse me.&quot; Seifer said quietly. Zell and Nicole looked up startled 
but Fujin didn&#39;t even flinch.

&quot;Oh, dude.... Now is so not the time.&quot; Zell grumbled.

&quot;Calm down.&quot; Seifer said smoothly. &quot;I uh, was wondering if I could come 
too...&quot;

Celest gasped slightly and looked to Fujin worriedly. Fujin stood a 
moment then looked at Seifer coolly, causing him to look about awkwardly 
before offering a short smile.

&quot;WHY?&quot; She asked simply.

&quot;I&#39;m about to leave, I wanted to....um....&quot; He paused, not liking the 
fact that Zell was listening. Sensing his nervousness, Zell sat up 
straight and folded his arms proudly. While Zone and Celest looked on 
eagerly.

&quot;I wanted to pay my respects...&quot; Seifer finally sighed, looking 
flustered.

Zell and Fujin both flinched in surprise.

&quot;Come on, cut me some slack you two.&quot; Seifer frowned.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin said simply.

&quot;There&#39;s your answer.&quot; Zell shrugged.

&quot;Fine, okay then.&quot; Seifer sighed. He was disappointed but couldn&#39;t blame 
them.

&quot;Aw come on guys.&quot; Celest spoke up. &quot;Let&#39;s put all the bad blood behind 
us already. I think we&#39;ve all be through enough. I mean, what can it 
hurt?&quot;

&quot;PLENTY.&quot; Fujin grumbled.

&quot;No, It&#39;s okay.&quot; Seifer said, looking at Celest. &quot;It&#39;s her call, I&#39;ll 
respect it.&quot;

Fujin folded her arms, impressed that he wasn&#39;t going to argue with her.

With that said, the three of them left, leaving Celest Zone and Seifer 
looking quietly at each other.

&quot;Aw well.&quot; Celest shrugged.

&quot;Bah, it&#39;s cool. I had to try at least.&quot; Seifer sat down and propped his 
feet on the table with a hearty sigh. &quot;Well I guess I should be heading 
out since I&#39;m not needed here.&quot;

&quot;Guess so.&quot; Zone grumbled, noting Celest&#39;s eyes lingering on the taller 
man.

&quot;Where are you heading anyway?&quot; Celest asked.

&quot;Ah who knows. I&#39;ve been all over the place.&quot; Seifer chatted idly, 
giving her a dashing grin.

&quot;That&#146;s too cool. I wish I had that kind of freedom.&quot; Celest smiled.

&quot;Me and Watts have our own train, we travel all the time...&quot; Zone 
mumbled.

&quot;Only thing stopping you is yourself.&quot; Seifer commented to Celest, 
cutting off Zone&#39;s comment.

&quot;I suppose, but I wouldn&#39;t even know where to start.&quot; Celest chuckled.

&quot;You look like a smart gal, I&#39;m sure you&#39;d have no problems.&quot; Seifer 
assured her coolly.

&quot;Bah, I&#39;m a ninny.&quot; Celest blushed. Zone, beginning to feel like a fifth 
wheel stood awkwardly.

&quot;I uh, gotta go get ready to leave... See you later.&quot; He mumbled.

&quot;Bye hon.&quot; Celest smiled warmly.

&quot;See ya kid.&quot; Seifer grinned, before focusing back on the attractive 
redhead sitting across from him. Zone cringed in annoyance but kept it 
in check and without another word, skulked away.

******************

Ellone stood patiently at the door into Quistis and Fujin&#39;s room; once 
again she knocked, then frowned.

&quot;Are you sure she&#39;s here?&quot;

Doctor Kadowaki, who sat at her desk doing paperwork, looked up with a 
grin. &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure, she hardly ever leaves. Give her a moment, she&#39;s 
probably in the shower.&quot;

&quot;She knew I was coming, we have an appointment.&quot; Ellone sighed.

&quot;About that.&quot; Kadowaki said, looking at her hopefully. &quot;Now I know I&#39;m 
not particularly useful in whatever you two are doing, but I wish you&#39;d 
at least consult me or let me monitor things. After all Miss Trepe is my 
patient.&quot; The doctor sighed.

Ellone looked at the door in annoyance for a moment then walked over to 
her.

&quot;Sorry Ma&#39;am. But we need to concentrate and I fear you&#39;d be a 
distraction.&quot; She said in a truly regretful tone. Kadowaki nodded, in 
disappointment.

&quot;I appreciate your honesty. I think.&quot; She grinned, then looked hopeful. 
&quot;Well how&#39;s it going with you guys? Any luck?&quot;

&quot;Nothing much really... I hate to say so, but I&#39;m beginning to have my 
doubts...&quot;

&quot;It was to be expected. She was hurt so bad; it&#39;s amazing she lasted as 
long as she did. To be honest, She and Fujin both, should be gone.&quot;

&quot;Squall blames himself you know.&quot; Ellone sighed. &quot;He thinks if he and 
Zell got there faster they could&#39;ve done something.&quot;

&quot;I know, we&#39;ve talked about it.&quot; Kadowaki said regretfully.

Both women turned as Fujin entered the small clinic with Zell and Nicole 
close behind.

&quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t realize you were out.&quot; Kadowaki smiled.

&quot;There you are.&quot; Ellone smiled.

Fujin nodded politely to each of them.

&quot;APOLOGY, WAS EATING.&quot; She explained.

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Ellone smiled then clapped her hands together. &quot;Well, are 
we ready to start today&#39;s session?&quot;

&quot;A MOMENT.&quot; Fujin nodded, then looked to Zell.

&quot;Hey Ellone I didn&#39;t know you were still on board!&quot; He exclaimed 
brightly.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m staying for awhile. I still want to try and help out.&quot; The 
young woman responded with a quaint smile. &quot;What brings you two down 
here?&quot;

&quot;VISITING.&quot; Fujin explained.

&quot;Oh that&#146;s sweet.&quot;

&quot;How are you guys doing by the way?&quot; Zell asked as they entered Quistis&#39; 
room.

&quot;Ask Fujin, it&#39;s been a couple of days since last I&#39;ve seen her.&quot;

&quot;SHE IS WELL.&quot; Fujin noted.

&quot;Oh wow.&quot; Nicole awed. &quot;You&#39;ve really did wonders in here, it&#39;s very 
cozy.&quot;

&quot;There she is.&quot; Zell smiled warmly, rushing over to Quistis&#39; side. He 
then went wide-eyed. &quot;You cut her hair!&quot;

&quot;NORMAL AGAIN.&quot; Fujin groused.

&quot;Well yeah but I was getting used to it being long.&quot; He huffed.

&quot;WAS UNRULY.&quot; She shrugged.

Ellone giggled and sat down quietly as Zell pulled up a chair to gossip 
with the comatose instructor.

&quot;Yo, Miss Trepe you should have been at the wedding. I mean, I know you 
couldn&#39;t have been and all. Well, still, anyway, you know what I mean. 
It was great! Nicole took pictures and filmed a lot of it, so you can 
watch it when you get better!&quot; He chattered merrily.

&quot;Really Quisty, you&#39;re kind of lucky. You didn&#39;t have to wear those ugly 
bridesmaid gowns.&quot; Nicole chuckled, sitting down next to Zell.

&quot;They weren&#39;t that bad.&quot; Ellone giggled.

&quot;HIDEOUS.&quot; Fujin offered.

&quot;Celest screwed you gals over.&quot; Zell laughed.

&quot;Well...&quot; Nicole shrugged. &quot;We&#39;re not supposed to look better than the 
bride.&quot;

&quot;Well then it was a success, cause damn.&quot; Zell laughed.

&quot;Jerk!&quot; Nicole screeched in mock outrage, slapping at him.

Ellone laughed and Fujin couldn&#39;t help but grin.

&quot;You gotta see what they did to the place, I mean it rocks. Those boys 
in Esthar gave us the works. I bet it cost Cid a fortune though, but 
hell, we rock, so we deserve the best.&quot; Zell continued, laughing loudly.

&quot;Ignore him.&quot; Nicole whispered. &quot;He&#39;s on a sugar rush, he ate a entire 
box of doughnuts before coming over.&quot;

&quot;FAT.&quot; Fujin snorted.

&quot;Hey I am not! I&#39;m built like a god or something.&quot; Zell huffed, flexing.

&quot;OR SOMETHING.&quot; Fujin grumbled, rolling her eye.

&quot;Who asked you anyway?&quot; Zell shot back, brushing her off with a look.

&quot;Ahem.&quot; Kadowaki said, peeking into the room. &quot;I&#39;ve other patients out 
here, you mind keeping it down to a low roar.&quot;

&quot;Ow crap, sorry doc...&quot; Zell blushed, rubbing his head in embarrassment.

&quot;LOOK WHAT DID.&quot; Fujin spat.

&quot;Hey you started it!&quot;

&quot;Children! I said stop it.&quot; Kadowaki proclaimed in a loud, motherly 
tone.

&quot;Sorry.&quot; Zell and Fujin mumbled.

Nicole and Ellone exchanged knowing grins.

&quot;You would think you two were related.&quot; Nicole asked, getting up from 
her chair.

&quot;Bah, I&#39;d have killed her by now.&quot; Zell scoffed.

&quot;PUNK.&quot; Fujin growled.

&quot;Oh, oh you!&quot; Zell hissed, cutting her a dirty look.

&quot;We&#39;ll be going now.&quot; Nicole giggled as she grabbed Zell by the arm to 
lead him away.

&quot;Bye Miss Trepe!&quot; He waved, then shot Fujin another foul look.

Fujin folded her arms and ignored him as they left.

&quot;See you guys later.&quot; Ellone smiled, as she shut the door behind them.

&quot;That was entertaining.&quot; She then said, turning towards Fujin who was 
standing at Quistis&#39; side.

&quot;INDEED.&quot; Fujin said sarcastically.

&quot;She looks good.&quot; Ellone said, nodding to Quistis.

Fujin smiled a sad smile and ran a gentle hand through Quistis&#39; hair.

&quot;You really did a good job here.&quot; Ellone assured her. &quot;She&#39;s lucky to 
have you.&quot;

&quot;NEEDS ME.&quot; Fujin said quietly.

Ellone smiled at that, and went to get two chairs. Setting one on either 
side of Quistis&#39; bed.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Ellone she asked as they got settled.

&quot;OF COURSE.&quot;

&quot;I heard about the other day. Want to talk about it?&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Well at least it got you talking more.&quot;

&quot;HARDLY.&quot; Fujin huffed.

&quot;Still, glad to see you being more social.&quot;

Fujin didn&#39;t respond further and simply took Quistis&#39; hand in hers.

&quot;Okay, okay I get the hint.&quot; Ellone smiled. &quot;Lets get started.&quot;

*********************************

It was noon, and the sky was a colorless gray. The former training 
center had been converted to a forested, park area during the rebuilding 
process. Though a retractable glasslike shielding could be used when 
travelling at high altitudes, for the most part, the area was left open 
to the elements and now was covered in a light dusting of snow. Zell, 
Watts and Nicole sat at a quaint wooden park bench enjoying the cool air 
and the beauty of the place. Zone meanwhile stood on the shore of a 
small pond, throwing rocks at the thin ice that covered it.

&quot;What&#39;s with him?&quot; Zell asked curiously.

&quot;He&#39;s irked about Celest.&quot; Nicole whispered.

&quot;She turn him down?&quot;

&quot;It was my understanding sir, that he&#39;d spent the night at the young 
lady&#39;s apartment.&quot; Watts commented.

&quot;I thought so to, but he seems worked up about something.&quot; Zell 
surmised, then got up.

&quot;You Zone. You okay dude?&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot; Zone grumbled.

&quot;Ah yup, she burnt him.&quot; Zell said knowingly, tossing Nicole and Watts a 
look.

&quot;Oh dear.&quot; Nicole frowned in disappointment.

&quot;Bah, I was getting my hopes up for nothing. Heck, we don&#39;t even live 
near each other. Besides...she&#39;s too picky I think....&quot; Zone said with 
obvious contempt.

&quot;Well Sir, if you had kept eye contact with her, perhaps you&#39;d have 
fared better.&quot; Watts noted, sounding more sarcastic than intended.

&quot;I didn&#39;t ask you, ya priss.&quot; Zone snapped.

Watts looked goggle-eyed a moment then quietly went back to watching the 
snowfall.

&quot;Hey! That uncalled for.&quot; Zell piped up.

&quot;Boys, boys, please.&quot; Nicole said, waving her arms over her head like a 
referee calling foul. &quot;Zone, what happened hon? Things seemed fine when 
we left.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about it, I just want to go home.&quot; Zone mumbled.

Nicole looked to Zell for answers and he shrugged helplessly.

&quot;Sir, you tried, no need to get upset over it.&quot; Watts offered.

&quot;I&#39;m not upset!&quot; Zone spat. Then heaved over, his stomach roiling. &quot;See 
you all done went and got my ulcer acting up!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t believe this.&quot; Zell sighed, throwing his hands into the air.

&quot;Lets just go...&quot; Zone gurgled in annoyance, pulling himself to his 
feet.

&quot;Yeah, okay then, if that&#146;s what you want.&quot; Zell said warily.

&quot;All things considered, it&#39;s probably for the best.&quot; Watts said quietly.

&quot;Oh Zone.&quot; Nicole frowned.

&quot;Bah, lets just go.&quot; He snorted.

******************************

Seifer and Celest stood on the balcony overlooking Balamb&#39;s central 
lobby. The two of them had spent the better part of the day together, 
chatting and getting to know each other. Celest had to admit she found 
the man extremely interesting, and a tad bit dangerous in an exciting 
way.

&quot;Shame I didn&#39;t get to know you earlier.&quot; She finally said after a long 
moment of silence as the watched the students bustling about below them.

&quot;Don&#39;t say that, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&quot; Seifer said 
quietly.

&quot;Is it all true then?&quot; She asked in a curious, non-judgmental tone.

&quot;Most of it...&quot; He said slowly. &quot;All the worst parts...&quot; He added, 
turning to see her expression.

&quot;Okay.&quot; She nodded.

&quot;That all you have to say?&quot; He asked.

&quot;What do you want me to say?&quot;

&quot;That you hate me, forgive me, judge me?&quot;

&quot;And why should I do that.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not my place. Besides I don&#39;t think you&#39;re as bad as you think you 
are.&quot;

&quot;Dangerous assumption.&quot; He chuckled.

&quot;Perhaps... but I know people. You have problems, there&#39;s no denying 
that but then again, don&#39;t we all.&quot;

&quot;Wise girl.&quot; He grinned.

&quot;I get by.&quot; She shrugged, smiling at him warmly.

******************************

The place was frightening, cold, and lifeless. The ground, cracked and 
barren, stretched out, featureless into the horizon, where dark gray 
clouds hung in the air, ominous in the depth. A cacophony of wailing 
echoed with quiet relentlessness in the distance. The sound was 
unsettling but the two dismissed it as wind and over the months had 
grown somewhat used to it.

Fujin frowned and looked to Ellone who walked quietly beside her.

&quot;It&#39;s gotten worse.&quot; She said worriedly.

&quot;She wasting away...&quot; Ellone sighed, looking down at the dusty wasteland 
beneath her feet.

&quot;She has to be here somewhere...&quot; Fujin sighed, looking around 
helplessly.

&quot;We&#39;ve been looking for months Fu...&quot; Ellone said gently. Putting a hand 
on her shoulder. The two women, like their surroundings were devoid of 
color, Fujin pale as she was seemed more like a phantom.

Her pale skin glowed in contrast to the bleak surrounding while her 
eyes, dark and searching were nearly frightening in their intensity. 
Ellone was in a similar state, pale and gaunt, her eyes shallow and 
sunken, she seemed more like a walking corpse than human.

The strain of keeping them in firmly entwined with what lingered of 
Quistis psyche was hard. There was just so little to work with, and it 
was only getting worse.

&quot;Are you okay.&quot; Fujin asked, noticing how she looked.

&quot;It looks worse than it is...&quot; Ellone assured her. &quot;It&#39;s only a 
representation, I can last a while longer.&quot;

&quot;If you say so... &quot; Fujin sighed then looked around in desperation. 
&quot;It&#39;s all the same...&quot;

&quot;I wish I could be of more help, I really do, I just don&#39;t know what 
else to try. I, I&#39;m not to good at this sort of thing...&quot; Ellone said 
the stress and worry evident in her voice.

&quot;There has to be something of her left....&quot; Fujin mumbled quietly.

&quot;Fujin...it&#39;s possible that...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just saying.&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot;

&quot;Fu...&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to hear it!&quot; Fujin all but shouted, then started to fade 
until she was transparent.

&quot;You have to concentrate!&quot; Ellone said firmly. &quot;Don&#39;t stress yourself or 
you&#39;ll break out link.&quot;

&quot;Damn it...&quot; Fujin huffed, closing her eyes as she tried to keep calm. 
After a moment, she solidified. &quot;There.&quot;

&quot;I warned you.&quot; Ellone scolded her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Wait a minute.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Listen...&quot;

&quot;To what?&quot; Fujin frowned.

&quot;The wind, it&#39;s stopped.&quot;

Fujin looked around curiously. Indeed, the eerie howl was gone, an event 
that had not once occurred in any of their many attempts retrieve 
Quistis&#39; consciousness.

&quot;Is this a good thing?&quot; Fujin asked, looking worried.

&quot;No...&quot; A voice answered behind them. Both women spun around in fright. 
The jolt shattered their concentration and both started to fade. As they 
tried to recover, they studied the willowy figure before them. It was a 
young woman, short and slender, with delicate features. The girl&#39;s 
expression was grave and foreboding, her eyes black pools of darkness. 
Pointing to the dark clouds in the distance, she turned to address the 
two women.

&quot;They are free...&quot; She said, her voice sounding like a mix of Quistis&#39; 
and someone else, someone Fujin recognized instantly with the form.

With a jolt, She sat up and nearly fell out of her chair. Ellone too, 
was startled back into reality and looked ready faint.

&quot;What the heck was that!?&quot; She gasped.

&quot;AEKA...&quot; Fujin whispered, looking to Quistis, who lay ever still and 
expressionless.
