Quistis slowly opened her eyes, she was somewhat uncertain to where she 
was. She wondered if it&#146;d all been a dream until she felt Fujin stir 
against her. She was curled up cutely, a look of serenity on her face 
Quistis had never seen before. She smiled softly and stroked her hair, 
Fujin murmured in response and snuggled closer. Quistis had to suppress 
a chuckle and was content to let her sleep.

She quietly watched young woman next to her; asleep she looked nearly 
angelic with her porcelain skin and silver blue hair. She had a natural 
beauty that Quistis admired; Fujin had no need or desire for false 
pretenses such as make up and other trappings. There was something 
primal about her Quistis found secretly enticing, and yet she also had a 
certain vulnerability that made her want to protect and nurture her.

Fujin stirred slowly and let out a small yawn. Still half asleep she 
unconsciously cuddled closer.

&quot;Morning.&quot; Quistis whispered softly.

Fujin&#146;s eye opened wide with surprise and she found herself blushing. 
She sat up abruptly and looked about.

&quot;What&#146;s wrong?&quot; Quistis asked worried.

Fujin looked back at her slowly and shook her head.

&quot;NOTHING.&quot; Fujin said, her voice strained.

She&#146;d let her control slip again and nearly made a fool of herself. She 
couldn&#146;t help but ponder why Quistis had that effect on her. She thought 
back to last night and was startled with how natural it felt as they 
held each other. She had only wished to console Quistis, little did she 
realize how much she too needed someone close.

Now though she felt awkward and naked, unsure what to do. As if reading 
her mind,

Quistis leaned over her shoulder to whisper in her ear.

&quot;I have to go see Cid hon, thanks for letting me stay, that was very 
sweet of you.&quot; She hugged her gently before getting up.

Fujin quietly watched her as she gathered her things.

&quot;QUISTIS.&quot; She said with a curiously mellow tone.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Quistis regarded her evenly, not want to make her any more 
uncomfortable that she already was.

&quot;SEE AGAIN?&quot; Fujin asked with a bit of trepidation. Her expression was 
guarded, but Quistis could hear the shy hope in her voice.

&quot;If you want.&quot; Quistis replied with a soft smile.

Fujin couldn&#146;t face her but nodded solemnly.

&quot;Kay&quot; Quistis smiled to herself as she walked to the elevator. Fujin 
watched her leave and sighed heavily.

********************************************

Rinoa sat at her favorite table in the cafeteria, and was in a vile 
mood. She tried all night after they&#146;d returned to find Quistis. Xu 
claimed she left her in the garage and no one else seen her sense. She 
even had security unlock her apartment, only to find it empty. Quistis 
Trepe had apparently vanished. She cursed herself for losing track of 
her, when she obviously was in dire straits. She looked up hopefully 
when Selphie and Nicole entered the cafeteria.

&quot;Any luck?&quot; She asked eagerly.

Nicole shook her head sadly. &quot;Nothing no one&#146;s seen her since you guys 
got back last night.&quot;

Selphie sighed and wrung her hands worriedly.

&quot;Security says they saw her entering the elevator around 11:00 last 
night.&quot;

Rinoa shivered as a chill passed through her. She remembered how distant 
and cold Quistis was acting when they got back. Selphie saw the grim 
expression on her friend&#146;s face and nearly staggered.

&quot;You don&#146;t think.&quot; She wimpered.

Nicole turned sharply on her.

&quot;Don&#146;t even think that!&quot;

&quot;But?&quot; Selphie was nearly in tears.

Rinoa took a deep breath, she didn&#146;t want to entertain the idea of 
losing Quistis in the least.

&quot;Selphie listen to me.&quot; She reached out and took the girls face in her 
hands. &quot;It&#146;s going to be okay trust me. Shes fine I know it.&quot;

Selphie sniffled, her large eyes sparkling.

&quot;How can you be sure, you know how upset shes been. I just know..&quot; Rinoa 
cut her off.

&quot;Selphie! Please we cannot afford to do this right now, understand.&quot; She 
said sternly as she tried to fight back her own tears of worry. Nicole 
brought her hands to her face and choked, the stress getting to her.

&quot;Morning guys.&quot; Quistis chirped happily as she set her tray down on the 
table. She paused before sitting and looked curiously at her friends. 
She looked worriedly at the trio as their slackjawed gazes locked on 
her.

&quot;Did I come at a bad time?&quot; She moved to pick up her tray and sit 
elsewhere.

&quot;Quisty!&quot; Selphie shouted abruptly scaring the bejesus out of everyone 
and tackled her. They both nearly ended up on the floor, Quistis 
staggered back and caught herself.

&quot;Um morning to you to Selph?&quot; Quistis laughed warily as the small woman 
clung to her like a frightened child.

Nicole covered her heart with her hand and exhaled harshly.

&quot;Quistis we were worried sick about you.&quot;

Rinoa stood up and put her hands on her hips in a motherly gesture that 
Quistis found slightly irksome.

&quot;Where have you been? We&#146;ve been going crazy.&quot; She stamped her foot to 
emphasize the point.

Quistis looked at them all warily.

&quot;Just left my apratment, you must have missed me.&quot;

Rinoa arched a brow.

&quot;Oh really? We where there a few hours ago and you weren&#146;t there?&quot; She 
folded her arms expectantly.

&quot;Un Huh.&quot; Quistis wagged a finger at her as she disengaged Selphie from 
aorund her midsecction.

&quot;So it was you guys who&#146;d been creeping about my place? I came in this 
morning to change clothes and found my door unlocked and some of my 
things moved about.&quot;

Selphie looked up at her innocently.

&quot;We just wanted to make sure you was okay.&quot; She murmered tearfully.

&quot;Okay? Why wouldn&#146;t I be?&quot; Quistis asked innocently enough but she had 
more than a sneaking feeling about what had been going on. Rinoa sat 
back down and composed herself, she was greatly relieved to find her 
friend safe and sound. Everyone else sat down as Nicole shrugged simply.

&quot;Well, to be honest.&quot; She started the paused awkwardly. Rinoa piped in 
with an apologtic smile.

&quot;We all were worried that, well you have been acting strange lately.&quot; 
She stumbled over her words.

&quot;Well what? You think I was going to try and hurt myself right?&quot; Quistis 
said bluntly then bit into a biscut. Selphie nearly choked as she went 
into a fit of coughing, Nicole clapped her on the back as she nodded 
gravely.

Rinoa offered a shrug and looked at her seriously.

&quot;You still have to admit you&#146;ve been acting strange.&quot;

Quistis rolled her eyes and took a drink of water.

&quot;You don&#146;t have to worry about me, I&#146;m fine, trust me, and yes admitedly 
I&#146;ve been a little depressed but I got over it.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Selphie asked with a worried tone.

&quot;Yes really.&quot; Quistis assured her.

Nicole let out a sigh and rubbed her temples. Rinoa still felt something 
amiss and decided to press further.

&quot;Well?&quot; She asked patiently.

&quot;Well what?&quot; Quistis was getting somewhat flustered with all the 
questions.

&quot;Where were you?&quot;

&quot;Here about. Being a tad nosy aren&#146;t we?&quot; Quistis snapped mildly.

&quot;Okay, okay fair enough, don&#146;t get all defensive.&quot; Rinoa relented.

&quot;Eww no.&quot; Selphie droned, pointing with her eyes towards the cafeteria 
line. Everyone turned to see what she was talking about. Fujin stood 
patiently in line and apparently oblivious to their presence.

&quot;Oh dear.&quot; Rinoa sighed.

Quistis made eye contact and was about to call her over. Fujin seemed to 
sense her intentions and dissuaded her with a dark glance.

&quot;When did that ghoul get back.&quot; Selphie frowned.

&quot;Stop that.&quot; Quistis said seriously.

&quot;Poo.&quot; Selphie sighed and propped her head in her hands.

&quot;I thought you didn&#146;t like her Quistis?&quot; Nicole asked curiously. &quot;From 
what you all told me she caused quite a bit of trouble?&quot;

&quot;I never hated her, we just.&quot; She shrugged at a loss for words. &quot;Well 
things change.&quot; Quistis finally offered quietly.

&quot;That&#146;s awfully forgiving of you.&quot; Rinoa piped.

&quot;I suppose.&quot; Quistis mumbled as she absently poked about her plate with 
her fork.

Selphie raised up eagerly.

&quot;Oh hey!? I heard Xu about had kittens over you bringing the class in 
late?&quot; She said with ominous curiosity.

&quot;Me and her have butted heads a lot recently.&quot; Quistis soured, seems 
everyone was in on her business lately.

She glanced up as Fujin walked past; her eyes following her as she sat 
alone at a far table.

Selphie stared venomously.

&quot;What&#146;s with you.&quot; Nicole hissed as she kicked her under the table.

&quot;She&#146;s evil.&quot; Selphie said in defense.

Rinoa looked pleadingly to Quistis.

&quot;See what you&#146;re missing by being so anti-social.&quot;

&quot;Yeah I feel so under privileged.&quot; Quistis scoffed as she let her gaze 
drift to Fujin. She felt bad that her friend felt the need to sit away 
from everyone. Fujin noticed her and offered a faint whisper of a smile. 
Quistis returned the smile and quietly finished her meal. Nicole and 
Selphie were having a moral discussion about good vs. evil. Rinoa 
watched Quistis a moment, curious at to what she was grinning about.

&quot;You seem awfully chipper this morning.&quot; Rinoa smirked, she being kept 
in the dark and Quistis had a secret.

&quot;Maybe she got laid?&quot; Selphie chirped with bright-eyed glee before 
yelping loudly as Rinoa and Nicole both kicked her in the shin.

&quot;Selphie!&quot; Quistis gawked in shock. &quot;Nicole&#146;s right. What&#146;s gotten into 
you?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Selphie looked about innocently. &quot;We&#146;re not allowed to talk 
about it. Gee you&#146;d think your all a bunch of old ladies.&quot; Selphie 
finsihed sarcastically as she rubbed her throbbing shin.

&quot;Be tactful at least.&quot; Nicole whispered harshly.

&quot;Really.&quot; Rinoa agreed, then she looked at Quistis with a huge grin. &quot;So 
who is he? I know you weren&#146;t home last night, so you had to be 
somewhere.&quot;

&quot;Good lord!?&quot; Quistis was floored, she&#146;d about had enough of being the 
center of attention.

&quot;I&#146;ve got a meeting to go to. I&#146;ll see you later perhaps by then you 
guys can focus on something

important.&quot;

Nicole shook her head in dismay.

&quot;I apologize Quisty, they&#146;re apparently turning into busy bodies.&quot; She 
said while cutting the duo

a hawkish glare.

Rinoa and Selphie giggled to themselves. Quistis shook her head in 
annoyance as she dumped her trash.

As she left the cafeteria she nearly bumped into Luccian who was 
laughing and joking with several other youths. He looked at her and 
smiled.

&quot;Excuse me Miss Trepe, wasn&#146;t paying attention.&quot;

Quistis looked about like she was expecting an ambush.

&quot;My fault Luccian, don&#146;t worry about it.&quot; She said in her teachers tone.

&quot;Oh Miss Trepe before you run off. I wanted to apologize for getting you 
in trouble last night. Arch and me lost track of time. If you want I can 
explain everything Xu.

Quistis felt chilled by his politeness.

&quot;No thank you Luccian. It was my responsibility to keep track of all of 
you. Thank you though.&quot;

&quot;Not a problem.&quot; Luccian and bowed courteously and head towards the line 
then stopped to regard her once more.

&quot;Miss Trepe, I&#146;d um.&quot; He started somewhat shyly, which put Quistis on 
guard. &quot;I&#146;d like to apologize for being such a jerk lately. It&#146;s just 
that I&#146;ve had some problems with my dad recently. I&#146;ve been really 
stressed out. Anyway I just wanted to say I&#146;m sorry.&quot; He then gave a 
smile

Quistis would have considered gorgeous if not for the fact she care 
little for him. She nodded politely &quot;Apology accepted Luccian, and for 
its worth I apologize for slapping you.&quot;

Luccian waved the notion away.

&quot;Nah I deserved it really, I&#146;ve been a real ass. See ya in class.&quot; He 
smirked and joined the line.

&quot;Okay then.&quot; She smiled a glass smile. She glanced over and saw that 
Fujin was watching what transpired, Quistis waved lightly to her as she 
left the cafeteria.

*********************

Xu and Squall sat patiently in Cid&#146;s office. Since his last one was 
trashed by Balamb&#146;s transformation he took extra care in rebuilding it. 
It fit in oddly well with Balamb&#146;s artsy metal style. Dark mahogany 
shelves filled with various journals and encyclopedias lined the wood 
panel walls. Large leather seats and a huge heavy wood desk took up the 
floor space giving the area an aristocrat but claustrophobic feeling.

Edea stood behind Cid who sat at his desk sorting through papers. Xu was 
getting impatient and huffed. Squall looked over at her curiously.

&quot;Problem?&quot; He asked with his standard tone of indifference.

&quot;Where is she&quot; I&#146;ve better things to do that wait for her.&quot; She 
grumbled.

&quot;Patience child it is not even time yet.&quot; Edea said in a breezy tone.

&quot;Yes Ma&#146;am.&quot;

&quot;Xu I know Quistis has had some problems lately, but are you certain you 
want to pursue this. Even though she&#146;s not best instructor we have. 
There is something to be said for experience. That and the fact remains 
students pay more attention when they admire their teacher.&quot; Xu about 
jumped up from her seat.

&quot;That&#146;s because she&#146;s flirty and dresses like a tramp. It&#146;s rather 
inappropriate in my opinion, she has a fan club for crying out loud. 
That&#146;s no way for a class to run.&quot; Xu spat.

Squall put a calming hand on her shoulder and pulled her back in her 
seat. Cid removed his glasses and wiped them on his vest awkwardly.

&quot;Hmm well I see where you stand on the subject then.&quot;

Xu just folded her arms and stewed. Cid looked to Squall and sighed.

&quot;What about you? What do you think, you know her better than I?&quot;

&quot;She&#146;s having a rough time on a personal level, that&#146;s all I can say 
really. As for her teaching, while her methods are, well unique.&quot; He 
shrugged and couldn&#146;t help but smirk. &quot;She gets the job done, she 
trained me and I think I turned out okay.&quot;

&quot;He&#146;s impartial to case!&quot; Xu protested loudly.

&quot;No ones on trial.&quot; Edea said calmly.

&quot;She&#146;s right Xu, we&#146;re only reviewing Miss Trepe&#146;s license.&quot; Cid sighed, 
he hated when his staff fought.

&quot;Edea.&quot; Xu all but pleaded. &quot;You&#146;re rational, you taught her class 
before. Don&#146;t you think they would better off with another teacher? I 
mean, there was a reason her license was revoked to begin with, and as 
for Squall.&quot; She thumbed in his direction. &quot;Yes he turned out great, 
but, she also trained Seifer. We all know what became of that.&quot;

Squall rubbed his temple and hung his head at that. Cid sat back and 
looked thoughtfully and Edea stood stoically as always.

&quot;I assure you Miss Xiang that Seifer chose his own path and what he did 
not choose he could not have changed. Fate is a cruel mistress as was 
I.&quot; She said ominously.

Everyone was silent after that. A few moments later Quistis entered the 
office and looked cautiously at everyone.

&quot;Why do I feel like there should be a gallows?&quot; She said with a grim 
smile.

Cid pointed to the last empty chair.

&quot;Please sit, this will only take a moment.&quot;

Quistis took the seat next to Squall and sat down. Cid shuffled his 
papers absently then looked at her.

&quot;Miss Trepe.&quot; As you know, your license was revoked last year because 
several staff members felt you where too young to be a teacher. It was 
also said you needed to have a more professional relationship with your 
students.

&quot;I being fired again.&quot; Quistis said simply and stood to leave. Squall 
grabbed her arm and gently pulled her back into her seat. He began to 
think that was his only reason to be here.

&quot;Not unless you make me.&quot; Cid said simply.

&quot;What?&quot; Xu barked.

&quot;I am however putting you on paid vacation. From what I hear you&#146;ve been 
stressed out lately.&quot;

Quistis sat quietly she had no real basis to argue the point when it was 
true.

&quot;I understand Sir, how long?&quot;

&quot;One week. During that time I&#146;ll be doing a personal review of your 
class&#146;s grades and conduct records.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s ridiculous!&quot; Xu went to stand, Squall pulled her back down.

Edea raised a brow at her.

&quot;We will take care of the matter Xu. I believe you&#146;ve done your job, you 
are dismissed.&quot;

&quot;I.&quot; She started. &quot;Yes Ma&#146;am.&quot; Without another word she left the office.

&quot;As I was saying.&quot; Cid sighed. &quot;Enjoy your vacation, relax, do something 
new, just be up to par when you get back.&quot;

&quot;Yes Sir thank you. Is that all?&quot; She asked still somewhat confused 
about the matter.

Edea regarded her curiously.

&quot;Unless you have something to share?&quot;

Quistis glanced at Squall; he simply shrugged and looked so very bored 
by all this.

She looked up and frowned slightly, she had no idea how this would go 
over so she just blurted it.

&quot;Fujin returned last night.&quot;

Squall looked at and blinked.

&quot;She was alone?&quot; He asked warily.

&quot;Yes she sneaked in last night. I think she was afraid we&#146;d turn her 
away. I need to know if she&#146;s still welcome here?&quot; Quistis was more than 
ready to leave Balamb if she wasn&#146;t; she was not about see Fujin 
abandoned again.

Edea looked down at Cid who was deep in thought.

&quot;Yes child she is always welcome here.&quot; She said with a smile.

&quot;That&#146;s all I really had to add then.&quot; Quistis said evenly

&quot;Alright then, that will do it, you may go. Enjoy the trip.&quot; Cid said 
blandly.&quot;

Quistis got up and left the chamber, she tried to hurry without 
appearing to do so. As she entered the elevator she had the sneaking 
suspicion something-odd just occurred.</pre>
