By the time Fujin arrived back to her room, Quistis was up and 
frolicking around in the foyer; with some jarring dance music echoing 
from the complex sound system set up in the suite.

Amused, Fujin stood quietly in the doorway watching her dance about, 
oblivious to her presence. Finally, Quistis&#146; cavorting spun her around 
to face Fujin and she about hit the ceiling in fright.

&quot;You about scared me to death.&quot; She gasped laughingly.

&quot;SURPRISE.&quot; Fujin smirked.

&quot;Surprise yourself.&quot; Quistis giggled, dancing towards her. &quot;What&#146;d you 
bring me?&quot;

Fujin glanced at her bag thoughtfully.

&quot;CUTE THINGS.&quot;

&quot;Un huh.&quot; Quistis smiled, throwing both arms over Fujin&#146;s shoulders 
while gyrating smoothly with the music.

&quot;GOOD MOOD?&quot;

&quot;Always.&quot; Quistis answered with a satin smooth smile then arched a brow. 
&quot;Aren&#146;t you?&quot;

&quot;ALWAYS.&quot; Fujin responded candidly, then stole a kiss before slipping 
under Quistis arms to walk over to a nearby table. Setting the bag atop 
it she turned once more to face Quistis, who was still dancing merrily 
about.

&quot;QUISTIS?&quot;

&quot;Come dance.&quot;

&quot;KNOW BETTER.&quot;

&quot;Oh please.&quot;

&quot;CLUMSY.&quot;

&quot;You are not.&quot;

&quot;HAD ENCOUNTER.&quot;

&quot;Come here and I&#146;ll give you a real encounter.&quot; Quistis giggled 
playfully.

&quot;STRANGE WOMAN.&quot; Fujin said loudly over music.

&quot;I resent that.&quot; Quistis pouted, sticking her tongue out at her.

&quot;NOT YOU.&quot; Fujin sighed, and then put her hands on her hips 
thoughtfully. &quot;WELL, OKAY.&quot;

&quot;Cute.&quot; Quistis soured cutely then sauntered over towards her again.

 &quot;Okay so you met a strange woman. What about her?&quot; She asked, taking 
Fujin&#146;s hands in hers, pulling them to and for, much like when a child 
makes a doll dance. If anything Fujin&#146;s time with Quistis had taught her 
anything, it&#146;d been patience, so she endured the silliness of the moment 
for quiet some time before speaking again.

&quot;FLIRTED WITH ME.&quot; She said bluntly. Quistis jovial expression instantly 
dissolved into one of protective, if not jealous, concern.

&quot;Pardon?&quot; She asked dryly.

&quot;I THINK.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;NAOMI.&quot;

&quot;Naomi, that drama queen from Squall&#146;s class, the one with the big head? 
She&#146;s been gone for years!?&quot;

&quot;WHAT!?&quot; Fujin blurted in confusion then shook her head.

&quot;MANAGER&#146;S DAUGHTER.&quot;

&quot;What manager?&quot;

&quot;RESORT.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;ve only been gone an hour and your already elbowing with 
management?&quot; Quistis noted with an air of feigned snootiness.

&quot;MAKING FUN.&quot; Fujin frowned.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry.&quot; Quistis giggled then hopped up on the nearby table. &quot;Okay, 
tell me what happened.&quot;

&quot;STORE CLERK.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;UNIMPORTANT.&quot;

&quot;Okay, go on.&quot;

&quot;THOUGHT STEALING.&quot;

&quot;Who you?&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot; Fujin sighed.

&quot;And?&quot;

&quot;GIRL APPEARED, SETTLED.&quot;

&quot;Girl? You mean this Naomi person?&quot; Quistis noted. Fujin nodded and 
continued.

&quot;INSISTED RESTITUTION.&quot;

&quot;From the clerk right?&quot;

Again Fujin nodded, somewhat aggravated, she hated trying to explain 
fine details. Nodding to her shopping bag, she looked back to Quistis 
once more.

&quot;PAID FOR.&quot; She said simply. Quistis waited, for a long moment she 
waited, as if expecting more. Finally, she looked at Fujin expectantly.

&quot;What? That&#146;s&#146; it?&quot;

Another nod.

&quot;She gave you free stuff because you her harassed by the staff? Um I 
don&#146;t think that qualifies as being flirty. Especially if she&#146;s what you 
say.&quot;

&quot;GAVE LOOK.&quot; Fujin mumbled awkwardly.

&quot;A look?&quot;

&quot;YES.&quot;
&quot;Okay, now we&#146;re getting somewhere.&quot; Quistis nodded knowingly. &quot;What 
kind of look?&quot;

Fujin shrugged in befuddlement. &quot;A LOOK.&quot; She blurted, throwing her 
hands into the air helplessly.

&quot;What, was it some kind of come hither look?&quot;

&quot;UNEXPLAINABLE.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re just embarrassed.&quot; Quistis laughed.

&quot;NOT.&quot;

&quot;Do it.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot;

&quot;The look; let me see.&quot; Quistis asked with a straight face.

&quot;WILL NOT.&quot; Fujin gawked.

&quot;Was it like this?&quot; Quistis asked, her face contorting into an over 
dramatized mockery of someone blowing a kiss.

&quot;STOP THAT.&quot; Fujin grumbled, folding her arms.

&quot;Or this?&quot; Quistis continued, looking over her shoulder while saucily 
batting her eyes.

&quot;FOOLISHNESS.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis asked innocently.

&quot;ALL OF THIS.&quot; Fujin snapped slightly, going into a satire of the 
previous faces.

&quot;I wish I had a camera.&quot; Quistis mouthed with a grin.

Fujin growled in aggravation but laughed in spite of herself.

&quot;MAKING FUN.&quot; She grumbled, shoving her lightly.

&quot;You make it to easy, I&#146;m sorry.&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;ABUSE.&quot;

&quot;It is not.&quot;

&quot;SHOULD SUE.&quot;

&quot;If you want, but I don&#146;t have much.&quot;

&quot;CLOTHES.&quot;

&quot;You wouldn&#146;t be caught dead in half the stuff I wear, don&#146;t give me 
that.&quot;

&quot;SOME.&quot;

&quot;Name one. Sorry love but you lack pizzazz.&quot;

&quot;OFFENSIVE.&quot; Fujin squawked then folded her arms. &quot;HAVE PIZZAZZ.&quot;

&quot;Oh, like that camouflage thong I found when doing laundry?&quot;

&quot;DOESN&#146;T COUNT.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t worry, it&#146;s cute, adorable. Did a helmet come with that?&quot;

&quot;INCORRIGIBLE TODAY.&quot; Fujin sputtered, grabbing her.

&quot;Hey!&quot;

 &quot;ACTING LIKE CHILD.&quot;

&quot;What, put me down you ogre.&quot;

Sitting down, Fujin tossed Quistis across her lap. Realizing her 
intention, Quistis glared at her with all the awesome power at her 
disposal.

&quot;You wouldn&#146;t dare&#133;&quot; She said dangerously. Fujin took that as a 
challenge and brought her hand down sharply three times across her 
backside. Quistis&#146; eyes bulged and she let out a shout of shock.

&quot;Ow!&quot; She gawked. &quot;That hurt.&quot;

&quot;WAS PURPOSE.&quot; Fujin said evenly, her hand poised threateningly.

Quistis rubbed her rear ruefully, and gave Fujin a pouting look.

&quot;You hit me, I can&#146;t believe it!&quot;

&quot;WAS DESERVED.&quot;

Spinning over, Quistis swatted at her playfully. The act set them off 
balance and promptly to the floor in a flailing heap.

********************

The impromptu battle that soon ensued raged childishly across the suite, 
until finally, both combatants collapsed in a huffing heap, staring 
across from each other.

&quot;Hussy.&quot; Quistis groused, trying to tame her hair and regain composure.

&quot;PUNK.&quot; Fujin panted, kicking feebly at her.

The two paused a moment then burst into giggles before scooting beside 
each other. Fujin contently leaned against Quistis shoulder and draped 
an arm across her.

&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; Quistis asked curiously, toying idly with 
her hair.

&quot;BEEN TO LONG.&quot; Fujin noted quietly.

&quot;Yes it has, I like having you to myself.&quot;

&quot;GREEDY.&quot;

&quot;So are you.&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot; Fujin nodded, hugging tightly against her.

Quistis kissed the top of her head warmly then rested her head back 
against the wall.

&quot;I could stay like this forever.&quot;

&quot;CORNY.&quot; Fujin chuckled.

&quot;I don&#146;t care, it&#146;s true.&quot;

&quot;AGREE.&quot;

&quot;You do know though, we can&#146;t just stay holed up in here.&quot;

&quot;WHY NOT.&quot;

&quot;We have to eat.&quot;

&quot;ROOM SERVICE.&quot;

&quot;I though you wanted to explore the sights.&quot;

&quot;I DO.&quot;

&quot;Where should we go first? Or is this one of those, you&#146;re going to go 
off alone things, like when we went skiing.&quot;

&quot;NO.&quot;

&quot;Good, I can&#146;t believe you snuck out without me.&quot;

&quot;APOLOGY, DISTRACTING.&quot;

&quot;Who me? I was teaching you?&quot;

&quot;STILL.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m not distracting.&quot;

&quot;EYES.&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot;

&quot;ENTRANCING.&quot;

&quot;Oh stop it.&quot; Quistis blushed laughingly. &quot;Now you&#146;re just trying to 
make me feel better.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin smirked, raising up to give her a quick kiss on the 
cheek.

&quot;Well, thanks, that&#146;s sweet of you to say, in your own peculiar way I 
guess.&quot;

&quot;WELCOME.&quot;

Quistis looked thoughtfully up the hall.

&quot;You know what?&quot; She said quietly.

&quot;CAUTION.&quot; Fujin mumbled, eying her suspiciously.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;TONE, TROUBLE.&quot;

&quot;What tone.&quot;

&quot;NEVER MIND. WHAT?&quot;

&quot;Brat.&quot; Quistis huffed, bonking her lightly atop the head. &quot;What I was 
going to say is.&quot; She continued. &quot;I&#146;ve read things about Zero G 
chambers.&quot;

&quot;TROUBLE.&quot; Fujin reiterated.

&quot;You don&#146;t even know what I&#146;m talking about.&quot;

&quot;I READ TOO.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;ORACLE MAGAZINE.&quot;

&quot;You never told me you read women&#146;s magazines?&quot;

&quot;DON&#146;T&quot;

&quot;Then where?&quot;

&quot;YOURS, IN BATHROOM.&quot;

&quot;Oh, well I guess you did then.&quot; Quistis mumbled, pursing her lips in 
annoyance. &quot;You read the part then about how it adds to the&#133;&quot;

&quot;NONSENSE.&quot; Fujin huffed, cutting her off

&quot;How do you know if you never tried it?&quot;

&quot;IS DANGEROUS.&quot;

&quot;Hardly, the room&#146;s padded and it&#146;s not like we&#146;d be bouncing off the 
walls.&quot;

&quot;NOT HEARING THIS.&quot; Fujin blushed, covering her ears.

&quot;Look at you.&quot; Quistis laughed. &quot;You&#146;re blushing.&quot;

&quot;AM NOT.&quot;

&quot;You are too, you&#146;ve been thinking about it too.&quot;

&quot;HAVE NOT.&quot;

&quot;You pervert.&quot;

&quot;SHUT UP.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s okay.&quot; Quistis giggled. &quot;Why did you think I got us this suite?&quot;

&quot;DID NOT!&quot; Fujin gawked.

Quistis nodded vigorously with a mischievous grin. &quot;Un huh, I sure did.&quot;

&quot;MADNESS.&quot;

&quot;You say that now.&quot;

&quot;YOU&#146;RE THE PERVERT.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m adventurous; at least I&#146;ll admit it.&quot;

&quot;UNDERSTATEMENT.&quot;

&quot;Hey now, your one to talk, so I don&#146;t want to hear it, or I should I 
start naming things.&quot;

Fujin made a squeaking noise and covered her face in embarrassment.

&quot;Thought not.&quot; Quistis grinned, then stood. &quot;Come on, get up.&quot;

&quot;NOT GOING IN.&quot;

&quot;Calm down you clown. It&#146;s too early for all of that. I&#146;m hungry.&quot;

&quot;OH.&quot; Fujin mumbled, rising to her feet.

Quistis rubbed her rear tenderly then tossed Fujin a dark look.

&quot;I still can&#146;t believe you spanked me&#133;&quot;

&quot;APOLOGIES&#133;&quot;

&quot;Do it again.&quot; Quistis said with quick eagerness and a downright wicked 
smile.

&quot;QUISTIS!&quot; Fujin blurted in shock. Throwing an arm around her, Quistis 
laughed brightly at the look on her face.

&quot;You&#146;re going to have to loosen up.&quot; She giggled.

&quot;NOT SERIOUS?&quot;

&quot;No, not at all.&quot; Quistis scoffed.

&quot;GOOD.&quot;

&quot;Well maybe a little.&quot; She added with a wink.

****************

After cleaning up and browsing through the brochures, the two settled on 
a scenic ride on small, orbital shuttle. The trip was enjoyable enough 
with plenty to see. The trip back however was dull and Fujin, much to 
the chagrin of the flight attendants, spent most of the time playing 
weightless games with the complimentary meal packs. She found the 
toothpaste like substance unsavory, what, with the unappealing texture 
and squeezable tubes it came in.

Quistis was oblivious to her antics, having become in engrossed with a 
magazine. Only when a stewardess quickly snatched the free-floating 
tubes away, did she notice Fujin&#146;s creation. A small hovering spider 
like thing made up of what appeared to be veal paste and what could only 
be a type of pudding.

&quot;That&#146;s disgusting.&quot;

&quot;TASTES LIKE.&quot;

&quot;I know. That&#146;s why I didn&#146;t even try. You&#146;d think for what they are 
charging they&#146;d have better service. Oh well, at least the flight was 
nice.&quot;

&quot;INDEED.&quot; Fujin smiled, encasing the floating mass in a napkin and 
disposing of it.

&quot;MOON.&quot;

&quot;What about it?&quot;

&quot;SO RED&#133;&quot;

&quot;I know, scary isn&#146;t it?&quot;

&quot;STRANGE.&quot;

&quot;What? The lunar cry?&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Luckily though, with the other gardens helping out, we&#146;ve about cleared 
up the effects of the last one.&quot;

&quot;UNNATURAL.&quot;

&quot;You could say that. Though I&#146;m not going to try and rationalize it, 
I&#146;ll leave that to the church to figure out.&quot;

&quot;LOVE YOU.&quot; Fujin commented calmly, out of the blue, causing Quistis to 
smile. Usually Fujin refrained saying such things aloud; for fear of how 
awkward she sounded.

&quot;Well that was unexpected. I love you too.&quot; Quistis smiled, kissing her 
lightly on the cheek. As she straightened, she noticed a trio of young 
men staring at them from nearby seats.

&quot;FAN CLUB.&quot; Fujin noted, out of the corner of her eye.

&quot;Actually, I think they&#146;re checking us both.&quot; Quistis commented as Fujin 
rested her head against her shoulder.

&quot;HUMOROUS.&quot; Fujin smirked, looking up at her curiously.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;YOUR HAIR.&quot;

&quot;What about it.&quot; Quistis frowned, reaching up to inspect it curiously 
only to find that the long, twin bangs that framed her face were 
floating out to the sides of her head where they bobbed about slowly 
like seaweed in a current.

&quot;Cute&#133;&quot; She grumbled, pushing them down.

&quot;I can&#146;t believe you cut your hair. You look good with it long.&quot;

&quot;WORRISOME.&quot;

&quot;Yeah it can be I guess. Why&#146;d you let it grow out then?&quot;

&quot;COMA&#133;BUSY.&quot;

&quot;Oh&#133;&quot; She winced, feeling somewhat guilty for putting her through such 
torment.

&quot;Thanks again&#133;&quot;

&quot;STOP IT.&quot; Fujin said in a hushed whisper. Gently she took her hand and 
looked serenely at her.

&quot;BE THERE, ALWAYS.&quot;

&quot;I know, I just wish I had some way to make it up to you.&quot;

&quot;HAVE, DID NOT GO.&quot;

&quot;True.&quot;

&quot;SHUSH.&quot; Fujin smirked, kissing her knuckles sweetly. Then turned to the 
duo watching them.

&quot;MIND!&quot; She barked, causing them to jump and everyone else aboard the 
shuttle to turn and look. Quistis cringed slightly and shook her head as 
the same stewardess Fujin encountered walked briskly over to them, her 
magnetic boots clomping noisily even on the cabin&#146;s carpeting.

&quot;Ma&#146;am, I must insist you refrain from disturbing the other passengers.&quot;

&quot;WASN&#146;T.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#146;am I&#146;m going to have to ask you to calm down.&quot;

&quot;AM CALM&#133;&quot;

&quot;No need to raise your voice.&quot;

&quot;QUISTIS, ASSISTANCE&#133;&quot; Fujin blurted with pleading look.

&quot;We&#146;ll keep it down.&quot; Quistis smiled, patting Fujin&#146;s hand.

With a shrewd look, the stewardess nodded slowly.

&quot;I&#146;m glad to hear it. Enjoy your flight.&quot;

&quot;Thanks we will.&quot; Quistis said with a bubbly tone.

Upon the stewardess&#146; departure, Fujin folded her arms crabbily then 
huffed.

&quot;ASS.&quot;

&quot;Be nice.&quot; Quistis chuckled.

&quot;IS TRUE.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re just aggravated, relax.&quot;

Taking a deep breath, Fujin slumped in her chair.

&quot;Okay, now you&#146;re sulking.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Yes you are, and don&#146;t get all NEGATIVE with me. Talk like a normal 
person.&quot;

&quot;NOT FUNNY.&quot;

&quot;You know good and well what I mean.&quot; Quistis laughed, shoving her 
slightly. Fujin&#146;s sour demeanor cracked slightly and she let out a quiet 
giggle.

&quot;So bad.&quot; Quistis mouthed in a tiff, settling back in her seat.

***************

After the shuttle docked with the station, the two women exited quickly 
and made their way to central promenade.

&quot;I think I&#146;m going to complain.&quot; Quistis announced mildly.

&quot;ABOUT?&quot;

&quot;That shuttle trip, it was kind of lacking.&quot;

&quot;ENJOYED.&quot; Fujin lied.

&quot;You did not, you&#146;re just saying that to try and a make me feel better.&quot;

&quot;TRUE.&quot;

&quot;Stick to telling the truth, you stink at fibs.&quot;

&quot;WHATEVER.&quot;

&quot;Is there a problem?&quot; A female voice asked, causing them to turn.

Fujin&#146;s gaze widened slightly upon recognition.

&quot;Hi!&quot; Naomi winked with a bubbly grin.

Quistis arched a brow and looked down questioningly at the petite young 
woman.

&quot;Friend of yours?&quot; She asked Fujin quietly.

&quot;Hi, I&#146;m Naomi.&quot; The stranger smiled, offering a small wave.

&quot;Quistis.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet, you. Fujin and I met earlier. I was coming over to say hi 
and heard you complaining. Is there a problem?&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin blurted.

&quot;Actually.&quot; Quistis nodded back towards where the shuttle sat docked.

Naomi gave a knowing grin and nodded.

&quot;Daddy&#146;s idea, ugh, it&#146;s dreadful. The thing isn&#146;t even equipped with 
artificial gravity. I swear the man has no taste.&quot;

&quot;Daddy?&quot; Quistis nodded then grinned. &quot;Oh, this must be the woman you 
were talking about.&quot; She noted to Fujin casually.

&quot;Yeah, she was being hassled so I just, had, to intervene.&quot;

&quot;NOT HASSLED.&quot;

&quot;If you say so.&quot; Naomi smirked then regarded Quistis. &quot;Well, the shuttle 
aside, I hope your enjoying your stay so far?&quot;

&quot;Actually, we love it.&quot;

&quot;We, you two are here together then?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Sisters?&quot; Naomi asked, with a hint of a smile.

Quistis laughed at the notion. Folding her arms, her expression sobered 
slightly, the girl was playing games.

&quot;No, we&#146;re not sisters. Inquisitive sort aren&#146;t you?&quot;

&quot;Sorry, I meant no disrespect.&quot; Naomi bowed. &quot;Anyway, I have to run. 
It&#146;s been a pleasure meeting you Quistis. Fujin, see you later.&quot; She 
waved, before vanishing into the crowd.

 Fujin didn&#146;t say a word but just looked at Quistis sarcastically.

&quot;Okay, you were right.&quot; Quistis soured. &quot;She&#146;s after something.&quot;

&quot;BEING FRIENDLY.&quot;

&quot;Too friendly&#133;&quot;

&quot;NOW WHO PARANOID?&quot;

&quot;I have a reason to be.&quot; Quistis huffed, entwining her arm possessively 
with hers.

***********************************

The rest of their afternoon was quaint and entertaining. More shopping, 
sight seeing and various stops to take photos. The resort was equipped 
with a fair sized indoor beach that dominated a whole section of the 
western most side. Complete with massive, wave machines and a small but 
respectable array of fresh water marine life the small beach was in fact 
a functional, albeit small ecosystem. The most entrancing aspect of the 
beach though was the view. The entire structure was covered by a 
transparent dome; slightly tinted to shield from the powerful rays of 
the sun. The overall effect was bedazzling and offered a startlingly 
unmatchable panorama of the cosmos.

Fujin&#146;s heart skipped a beat and she promptly kicked off her shoes and 
scampered forward until she was ankle deep in water. Quistis giggled and 
watched her cheerfully. Neither of them had come to swim and so weren&#146;t 
really wearing the proper clothes.

&quot;QUISTIS.&quot; Fujin gasped, marveling at the view.

&quot;You&#146;re going to get soaked.&quot; Quistis smiled.

&quot;IS BEAUTIFUL.&quot; Fujin gawked, her gaze twinkling in awe.

&quot;Yes it is.&quot; Quistis agreed then took a quick picture without her 
knowing.

&quot;CAN RETURN?&quot; Fujin pleaded hopefully.

&quot;Of course silly, when?&quot;

&quot;TONIGHT, LATE.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s a date, now get out of there before a wave gets you.&quot;

Fujin bounded around merrily a moment then scurried back with a wide 
smile, a site that Quistis would treasure forever.

&quot;I knew you&#146;d like it.&quot;

&quot;LOVE IT, WONDERFUL!&quot;

&quot;So are you.&quot; Quistis smiled warmly, causing her to blush.

&quot;Ready for dinner?&quot;

&quot;YES.&quot;

&quot;Come on then, let&#146;s go.&quot;

&quot;WHERE?&quot;

&quot;Up to you.&quot;

&quot;OUT?&quot;

&quot;Pardon?&quot;

&quot;CLUB, LAST NIGHT.&quot;

&quot;I thought you didn&#146;t want go?&quot;

&quot;CHANGED MIND.&quot;

&quot;Oh, is that so?&quot; Quistis wondered, intrigued.

&quot;YES.&quot;

&quot;Why the sudden change of heart?&quot;

&quot;FEEL, ADVENTUROUS.&quot; Fujin smirked.

&quot;Adventurous eh. Okay, you have my attention.&quot;

*********************

Nightfall, and Fujin was beginning to have second doubts.

&quot;Hold still, I don&#146;t want to poke you in the eye.&quot; Quistis mumbled as 
she helped Fujin with her eyeliner.

&quot;FEEL SILLY.&quot;

&quot;You look gorgeous.&quot;

&quot;MAKE UP ANNOYING&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t even want to hear it miss perfect skin.&quot; Quistis laughed, 
setting the liner down. &quot;Heck, I&#146;d kill to have skin like yours, what&#146;s 
your secret?&quot;

&quot;AVOID SUN.&quot; Fujin said dully, as if it were obvious.

&quot;Oh, yeah&#133;&quot; Quistis laughed blushingly. &quot;I guess that&#146;s why, perk of 
being albino eh.&quot;

&quot;NOT FUNNY.&quot;

&quot;Sorry.&quot; Quistis shirked. &quot;Shall I eat my other foot as well?&quot;

&quot;TEASING.&quot; Fujin smiled, letting her off the hook.

&quot;Thank goodness.&quot; Quistis sighed, leaning back to observe her work.

&quot;WELL?&quot;

&quot;Honestly I didn&#146;t have to do much. The eyeliner worked wonderfully. It 
really brings out your eyes.&quot;

&quot;EYE.&quot;

&quot;You know what I mean, quit being snobbish.&quot;

Fujin giggled as stood to observe herself in the mirror intently.

&quot;See you look great.&quot; Quistis smiled, hugging her around the shoulders 
from behind. &quot;And the midriff, very sexy, good choice.&quot;

&quot;GOT, FLAUNT.&quot; Fujin giggled.

&quot;I created a monster; you&#146;re sounding like Celest now.&quot;

&quot;BAH.&quot; Fujin huffed, turning this way and that.

&quot;You know.&quot; Quistis started, watching her with a warm gaze. &quot;I don&#146;t 
think I&#146;ve ever seen you so happy.&quot;

&quot;GOOD REASON.&quot;

&quot;Oh, why is that?&quot;

&quot;YOU HERE.&quot; Fujin winked, at her from the mirror. This time, it was 
Quistis who blushed.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; She smiled, kissing her warmly on the cheek before studying 
herself in the mirror as well. Both women where clad in black, Fujin 
wore her new outfit, which while being sexy, was somewhat reserved. 
Quistis on the other head looked ready to start a riot with her form 
fitting little black dress, and sleek stockings the put a maddening 
emphasis on her long legs

&quot;Damn we look good.&quot; She smiled saucily, looking over her glasses with 
an arched brow.

&quot;INDEED.&quot; Fujin blushed.

Satisfied that they were ready, the two gathered their things then 
strode out the door, Quistis&#146; high heels echoing loudly. Fujin looked up 
at her sourly as they strode up the hall.

&quot;What now?&quot; Quistis asked noting her expression.

&quot;HEELS.&quot;

&quot;What about them? You said you didn&#146;t want to wear any.&quot;

&quot;NOT ME.&quot;

&quot;Oh this again.&quot;

&quot;TOO TALL.&quot;

&quot;We&#146;ve had this talk before.&quot;

&quot;MAKE LOOK SHORT.&quot;

&quot;Your not short, I&#146;m just tall.&quot;

&quot;BOLOGNA.&quot; Fujin snorted, Quistis exploded into laughter at the odd 
outburst.

&quot;What is that supposed to mean?&quot;

&quot;AM SHORT.&quot;

&quot;You are not! Look at Selphie, now she&#146;s short.&quot;

&quot;TRUE, IS MIDGET.&quot;

&quot;Oh I did not just hear that, she&#146;d have a complete fit if she heard 
you, you know how sensitive she is about that.&quot;

&quot;IS TRUE.&quot;

&quot;She&#146;s not a midget and you know it, you&#146;re just being mean cause you&#146;re 
mad about the heels.&quot;

&quot;AM NOT.&quot;

&quot;You are too. Why is it you throw a fit whenever I wear heels?&quot;

&quot;DON&#146;T.&quot;

&quot;Oh hold on now.&quot; Quistis sighed, pausing their stride. &quot;What&#146;s the deal 
here Fu?&quot;

&quot;IS SILLY.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

Fujin started to rub her eye awkwardly but Quistis stopped her.

&quot;You&#146;ll mess your makeup. Now tell me what this is about.&quot;

&quot;FINE.&quot; Fujin sighed, then stood on her tiptoes to give her a kiss but 
came up short.

&quot;You&#146;ve got to be kidding me.&quot; Quistis said quietly, the corners of her 
mouth twitching.

&quot;SEE.&quot; Fujin pouted, feeling ridiculous.

With a confused blink, Quistis took a step back and looked around as if 
answers would be forthcoming from midair.

&quot;Okay&#133;&quot; She started slowly, her gaze meeting hers. &quot;That has got to be&#133;&quot; 
She paused and grinned. &quot;The single most adorable thing I&#146;ve ever heard 
in my life.&quot; She finished then erupted into to wild giggles.

Fujin made a face and folded her arms sourly.

&quot;Hyne I love you!&quot; Quistis giggled, cradling her face with her hands as 
she bent slightly to kiss her on the lips. &quot;Now see, that wasn&#146;t so hard 
now was it, I can&#146;t believe you sometimes.&quot;

&quot;WAS WORRISOME.&quot;

&quot;Only to you.&quot; Quistis giggled, kissing her again. &quot;That is just to 
cute&#133;&quot;

&quot;NOT&#133;&quot; Fujin started in protest but was cut off.

&quot;No, don&#146;t even try it!&quot; Quistis laughed, pointing an accusing finger at 
her before entwining her arm snuggly. &quot;You&#146;re never going to make me 
think otherwise.&quot;

&quot;BEING SILLY.&quot;

&quot;Me!? I&#146;m being silly!?&quot;

&quot;QUISTIS.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;WILL BE LATE.&quot;

&quot;Fine change the subject then, see if I care.&quot;

&quot;FINE.&quot; Fujin grumbled unconvincingly, her fa&ccedil;ade of indifference 
utterly ruined. Quistis laughed merrily to herself as she pulled Fujin 
along, her long legged strides forcing her to quicken her pace to keep 
up.

 When they arrived at the restaurant, they were pleased to find that it 
wasn&#146;t terrible busy, a fact that calmed Fujin&#146;s nerves a bit. As they 
entered, the sound of music got their attention. Easy going dance music 
echoed across from one side of the establishment, where a bar and dance 
floor waited.

&quot;Dinner and a show.&quot; Quistis grinned.

&quot;HOSTESS.&quot; Fujin mumbled, nodding towards a young woman walking towards 
them from the dining section.

&quot;How are you ladies doing, I&#146;m Lindsey, do you have a reservation?&quot;

&quot;Um no, I didn&#146;t know we needed one.&quot; Quistis frowned.

&quot;You, don&#146;t, I was just checking, smoking or non.&quot;

&quot;Non, please.&quot;

&quot;Right this way.&quot; The young woman said politely, motioning for them to 
follow. Quistis liked the attention and strode confidently through the 
crowd, while Fujin kept a lower profile. It didn&#146;t take long for the 
stares to start and she subconsciously took Quistis&#146; hand for comfort.

 Their seat was next to a fare sized water feature, and the tinkling of 
the water made for a pleasant backdrop. The lighting was dim and 
intimate, and the crowd far more docile than most clubs, and all things 
together quickly put Fujin&#146;s nerves at ease. Once seated, the hostess 
offered them menus and bowed politely.

&quot;Here you go; your waiter will be with you shortly.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Quistis smiled then focused on Fujin.

&quot;You have fans.&quot; She smiled.

&quot;NOT ME, YOU.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re being modest.&quot; Quistis winked, leaning forward. &quot;Are you sure 
you&#146;re okay?&quot;

Fujin looked around slowly; then nodded. Quistis took her hands in hers 
and squeezed them affectionately.

&quot;Relax, we&#146;re here to have fun.&quot;

&quot;AM OKAY.&quot;

&quot;You look terrified.&quot;

&quot;HARDLY.&quot; Fujin scoffed.

&quot;We can go somewhere else.&quot;

&quot;AM FINE.&quot; Fujin said again, shaking her head. Quistis&#146; doting was 
making her feel silly.

&quot;Good evening, what can I help you ladies with? Something to drink 
perhaps?&quot; Their waiter, a tall, statuesque man with blonde hair and dark 
eyes smiled.

&quot;WATER.&quot; Fujin blurted, still glancing over her menu.

&quot;Hmm a water for now.&quot; Quistis muttered, thoughtfully. &quot;Oh, and a bottle 
of Chantour&#146;ve&quot; She settled, pointing to an exotic wine.

&quot;CHEF SALAD.&quot; Fujin finally decided, handing her menu to him.

&quot;That&#146;s it?&quot; Quistis asked curiously.

Fujin nodded contently and folded her arms over her chest as she looked 
around idly.

&quot;You&#146;ll be hungry later.&quot; Quistis noted.

Fujin sighed and leaned over the table to point at something on the 
menu.

&quot;Oh&#133;&quot; Quistis smiled softly then looked at the waiter. &quot;Add the 
Leuve&#146;don special, with saut&eacute;ed mushrooms and a chicken croissant too 
please.&quot;

Fujin blushed in annoyance at her limited vocal ability. Unfazed, the 
waiter noted the order then regarded Quistis once more.

&quot;And what would you like?&quot;

&quot;We&#146;ll I&#146;m starving, I&#146;ll take the grilled salmon special with white 
rice, and a Chef Salad as well.&quot;

&quot;Very well, I&#146;ll return shortly with your drinks.&quot; The man nodded then 
hurried off.

&quot;He was cute.&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;SQUARE HEAD.&quot; Fujin shrugged then exhaled in soft relief. &quot;THANKS.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot;

&quot;MENU.&quot;

&quot;Oh&#133;&quot; Quistis winced. &quot;It&#146;s okay, I should&#146;ve known better, I&#146;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;IS ANNOYING.&quot;

&quot;I know it is, I&#146;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;OH WELL.&quot; Fujin shrugged, and offered a smile.

Quistis returned it then squeezed her hand before beaming brightly.

&quot;You have to try the wine when it gets here!&quot;

&quot;WHY?&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s classic, you&#146;ll love it I promise.&quot;

&quot;DRUNKARD.&quot;

&quot;I am not, and it would be called a wino, thank you.&quot;

&quot;WINO.&quot; Fujin amended.

Quistis rolled her eyes and grinned then frowned.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin asked worriedly.

&quot;Incoming.&quot; She explained, glancing over Fujin&#146;s shoulder to where a 
trio of guys where apparently trying to figure out how to approach them.

Fujin turned and Quistis moved to stop her.

&quot;Ack don&#146;t look.&quot; She shirked, but was to late.

&quot;HUH?&quot; Fujin frowned, turning back to face her.

&quot;See, now they think we&#146;re interested.&quot;

&quot;NOT.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but they saw you looking. Ah, yup, see here they come.&quot; Quistis 
giggled, shaking her head.

&quot;DAMN.&quot;

&quot;You did it, you deal with it.&quot;

&quot;ME!?&quot; Fujin balked.

&quot;How&#146;s it going?&quot; The first man said, obviously the leader of the trio. 
Tall, built and tanned, the man had gentle black curls and a gleaming 
smile. Overall, he looked like some pool boy a rich woman would have an 
affair with in some seedy soap opera. Leaning on the table he eyed the 
two women confidently.

&quot;Hello&#133;&quot; Quistis said politely while Fujin stiffened and offered no such 
greeting.

&quot;You two look lonely, how about you come sit with us.&quot; He offered, 
nodding back to his two friends who tried to look inviting.

&quot;Fujin?&quot; Quistis asked, looking at her.

Fujin&#146;s expression soured as she glanced over to her. Without saying a 
word she just shook her head slowly.

&quot;Oh come on now, we&#146;re not that bad, honest.&quot; He winked at Fujin. &quot;Come 
on, I&#146;ll even buy the drinks.&quot;

&quot;He&#146;ll even buy the drinks.&quot; Quistis smiled, eyeing Fujin mischievously.

&quot;They&#146;re with me Christen.&quot; Naomi announced, coming up behind him and 
patting him on the shoulder.

&quot;Naomi!?&quot; The man shriveled then raised up. &quot;How the hell do you do it?&quot;

&quot;A charming personality.&quot; She giggled brightly then waved him away.

Fujin and Quistis exchanged glances as the man left.

&quot;Hi guys.&quot; Naomi beamed.

&quot;You get around a lot don&#146;t you?&quot; Quistis noted guardedly.

&quot;This is my place; I&#146;d like to think I&#146;m welcome.&quot; Naomi teased then 
smiled at Fujin. &quot;Well hi there.&quot;

&quot;GREETINGS.&quot; Fujin mumbled, eyeing her suspiciously.

&quot;That&#146;s a lovely outfit.&quot; Naomi continued, her eyes gleaming.

&quot;Ahem.&quot; Quistis interrupted dryly.

&quot;There you are.&quot; A voice announced. All three turned to find a tall 
young woman walking towards them. Clean cut with straight black hair and 
tan, the stranger wore black slacks and matching vest with a neatly 
pressed white dress shirt underneath.

&quot;Ayane.&quot; Naomi beamed, hurrying over to her. &quot;Are you off already?&quot;

The woman nodded with a quaint smile then nodded to Quistis and Fujin.

&quot;Who are they?&quot; The woman said quietly, her voice having a dusty tone.

&quot;Friends of mine.&quot; Naomi smiled broadly. Quistis looked surprised by 
that particular revelation and was tempted to say something rude.

&quot;I&#146;ve got to apologize for her.&quot; Ayane smirked. &quot;Let me guess, she&#146;s 
been pestering you all night.&quot;

&quot;DAY TOO.&quot; Fujin grumbled.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Naomi pouted then pointed to her. &quot;This if Fujin and she&#146;s&quot; She 
began, pointing to Quistis but was cut off.

&quot;Quistis Trepe, of Balamb Garden.&quot; Ayane noted with an impressed look.

&quot;Um&#133;do we know each other?&quot; Quistis blinked.

&quot;I doubt it, but I know you. You saved my younger brother during that 
riot after the assassination attempt on the sorceress a few years ago. 
He was nearly trampled by the crowd and you pulled him to safety.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Quistis mouthed quietly. &quot;I remember that. How is he?&quot;

&quot;Fine, he broke his leg but it&#146;s healed up nicely.&quot;

&quot;She&#146;s a huge fan of yours.&quot; Naomi interjected, causing Fujin to shift 
in her seat. Ayane looked annoyed by the revelation and cut Naomi a dry 
look.

&quot;Thanks&#133;&quot; She grumbled then regarded Quistis again who was now blushing 
slightly. &quot;She&#146;s being dramatic. You&#146;re something of a pop icon in 
Deling.&quot;

&quot;ICON?&quot; Fujin sputtered.

&quot;Oh yes!&quot; Naomi explained eagerly. &quot;You&#146;re an inspiration to all kinds 
of young women, Ayane even has a poster of you and she&#146;s famous!&quot;

&quot;Ugh&#133;&quot; Ayane winced, brushing aside the long locks of hair that seemed 
to forever shroud her sharp features.

&quot;Oh, oh my.&quot; Quistis giggled awkwardly while Fujin looked baffled. 
&quot;That&#146;s, interesting to know.&quot;

Ayane cringed and looked over to Naomi with a soured expression.

&quot;Excuse me.&quot; The waiter announced, holding their drinks.

&quot;Oh excuse me.&quot; Naomi said, moving aside so he could reach the table.

&quot;FAMOUS?&quot; Fujin asked Ayane, sensing Quistis needed a helping hand.

&quot;Nah, not really, not compared to you guys. I assume you go to Balamb 
too?&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Lucky, I tried to get my folks to send me to Galbadia, but they didn&#146;t 
want me in the military.&quot;

&quot;Ayane is a track star, she can do it all, long jumps, hurdles, 100 
meter, you name it. She&#146;s won gold in the last three tri city 
championships and, she&#146;s done commercials and&#133;&quot;

&quot;Naomi.&quot; Ayane sighed, putting a finger to her lips.

&quot;You two want to sit down or something?&quot; Quistis interrupted. &quot;Its weird 
to have you guys looming around.&quot;

&quot;Oh, no we couldn&#146;t&quot; Ayane frowned. &quot;I&#146;ve already made a big enough ass 
of myself.&quot;

&quot;Sure, we&#146;d love to!&quot; Naomi answered, grabbing a nearby chair.

Fujin chuckled slightly and slide around to sit closer to Quistis.

&quot;It&#146;s okay, sit down.&quot; Quistis nodded to Ayane.

&quot;Sorry.&quot; The young woman apologized. &quot;She gets like this and there&#146;s no 
living with her. So, how long have you two been together?&quot;

Fujin nearly choked while Quistis was unfazed.

&quot;About two years.&quot; She answered simply.

&quot;Ha! I knew it!&quot; Naomi giggled, batting her hand against the table 
merrily.

&quot;I beg your pardon&#133;?&quot; Quistis grumbled.

&quot;Sorry, sorry&#133;&quot; Naomi shirked. &quot;It&#146;s just rare that we get to talk to 
anyone we share common ground with.&quot;

Fujin decided the conversation was beyond her comfort zone and decided 
to take Quistis up on the offer of wine and promptly downed a full 
glass.

&quot;You&#146;re supposed to sip that.&quot; Naomi frowned. &quot;You&#146;ll never enjoy it 
properly if you gulp it.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;ve tried to tell her.&quot; Quistis smirked.

&quot;You&#146;re friend here doesn&#146;t talk much does she?&quot; Ayane asked, glancing 
to Fujin who bristled at being mentioned.

&quot;Not too much.&quot; Quistis answered evasively.

&quot;You guys like it here so far?&quot; Ayane asked.

&quot;So far.&quot; Quistis answered.

&quot;Have you seen the wave pool!?&quot; Naomi exclaimed.

Fujin nodded briskly and Quistis smiled. &quot;Yes it&#146;s beautiful.&quot;

&quot;You like that? You should see the ice rink.&quot; Ayane noted quietly.

&quot;RINK?&quot; Fujin blinked. &quot;ICE SKATING?&quot;

&quot;Yes, it&#146;s a blast.&quot; Naomi explained.

&quot;Oh I have to get you out there!&quot; Quistis laughed, leaning against Fujin 
smilingly.  Getting comfortable, Naomi waved the waiter over and ordered 
some drinks for Ayane and herself.

*************

It didn&#146;t take long until all concerned where feeling tipsy and laughing 
uproariously at the silliest things. All that is except Fujin, who 
listened to the wild tales and exploits of their new associates with 
quiet amusement.

&quot;I can relate to the, old boyfriend thing.&quot; Quistis chuckled to Naomi 
from behind her wine glass.

&quot;KEVIN.&quot; Fujin noted with a weary sigh.

&quot;Kevin? Who&#146;s Kevin?&quot; Ayane wondered.

&quot;An old friend of mine.&quot; Quistis explained, rubbing her temples.

&quot;SAD MAN.&quot; Fujin commented dryly while nibbling on the remainder of her 
meal.

&quot;Tried to come and turn you back to guys eh?&quot; Ayane mused.

&quot;No, it&#146;s not like that. It&#146;s a long story.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t know, sounds typical to me, guys always think like that.&quot;

&quot;Yikes, I&#146;m sensing some little hostility towards guys there, Ayane.&quot; 
Quistis said curiously.

&quot;They suck.&quot; Ayane shrugged, downing the rest of her drink.

Fujin rolled her gaze over to Quistis who just shrugged.

&quot;Um okay then.&quot; She continued, and then looked to Naomi. &quot;How in the 
world did you two meet? I mean, you two are nothing alike.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re one to talk.&quot; Naomi giggled, then leaned against Ayane snuggly.

&quot;She came swooping in and seduced me.&quot; She sighed dreamily.

&quot;Oh please, you&#146;re the one who kept following me around until I talked 
to you.&quot; Ayane scoffed.

&quot;Humpf.&quot; Naomi grumbled, straightening in her seat. &quot;Well I can&#146;t help 
it if you&#146;re so obstinate.&quot;

&quot;So Quistis?&quot; Ayane blurted, changing the subject. &quot;Have you been to 
Esthar recently?&quot;

&quot;Um&#133; it&#146;s been a while, why?&quot;

&quot;Well, I was there a few months back and discovered something. 
Apparently they made play about you guys. Have you seen it?&quot;

&quot;PLAY?&quot; Fujin jerked, looking up with interest.

&quot;Oh Hyne&#133;you had to mention that.&quot; Quistis groaned.

&quot;Play, what play?&quot; Naomi wondered aloud then bounced in her seat. &quot;Oh! 
Oh! I know what you&#146;re talking about!&quot;

&quot;INFORM.&quot; Fujin asked, eyeing Quistis suspiciously.

&quot;There was a play out for awhile at some seedy art theater downtown, 
they did an adult play of the events of the war.&quot;

&quot;ADULT?&quot; Fujin choked, forcing her to take a drink.

&quot;Yeah, low brow porn disguised as art.&quot; Ayane explained.

&quot;I get the picture&#133;&quot; Quistis mumbled. &quot;And yes, I saw the flier for it.&quot;

&quot;You did?&quot; Naomi laughed. &quot;Can you believe the liberties they took with 
your image? I&#146;d be so pissed. I mean red hair, a corset and I&#146;m not even 
going to mention the whip.&quot;

&quot;HAS WHIP.&quot; Fujin noted.

&quot;What? You do?&quot; Naomi blinked.

&quot;Um, yeah&#133;&quot; Quistis blushed.

&quot;Oh that is so cool.&quot; Ayane brightened.

&quot;QUISTIS?&quot; Fujin asked quietly.

&quot;Yeah Fu?&quot;

&quot;THE WHIP?&quot;

&quot;What about it?&quot;

&quot;WHY?&quot;

&quot;I&#146;ll show you later.&quot; Quistis smiled wickedly, eyes gleaming.

Fujin blushed profusely and promptly dropped her fork on the floor. 
Naomi and she went for it at the same time and cracked heads.

&quot;DAMN IT.&quot; Fujin winced while Naomi rocked back in her seat cursing 
under her breath.

&quot;That&#146;s Karma.&quot; Quistis noted with a smile.

&quot;Isn&#146;t it though?&quot; Ayane agreed, smiling richly at her.

&quot;You okay?&quot; Naomi asked Fujin worriedly.

&quot;FINE.&quot; Fujin grumbled.

&quot;I love that song!&quot; Ayane brightened, looking towards the dance floor as 
an energetic beat started thumping from the speakers.

&quot;Come on!&quot; She smirked, standing up, only to be disappointed when no one 
moved to follow her.

&quot;What the?&quot; She frowned, looking back at the trio of women.

&quot;I&#146;ve two left feet you know that.&quot; Naomi laughed. &quot;Besides, I&#146;m tired 
of you yelling at me for stepping on your feet.&quot;

&quot;We&#146;ll go.&quot; Quistis grinned, rising to her feet and offering a hand to 
Fujin.

&quot;UNLIKELY.&quot; Fujin huffed, folding her arms.

&quot;Oh come on.&quot; Quistis pleaded, grabbing her hand and giving a tug.

&quot;NOT EMBARRASS SELF.&quot;

&quot;Oh fine then you big baby.&quot; Quistis scowled playfully, sticking her 
tongue out at her. &quot;I&#146;ll just go dance with Ayane then.&quot; She smiled 
teasingly, grabbing the other woman&#146;s sleeve.

&quot;What?&quot; Ayane blinked as she was dragged away.

&quot;HEY!&quot; Fujin sputtered in disbelief.

&quot;Um should I be worried?&quot; Naomi mumbled quietly, looking over to her.

&quot;HA.&quot; Fujin smirked slyly, gesturing to Quistis with a knowing nod. &quot;NOT 
FALLING FOR.&quot; She huffed, folding her arms, and then leaning back in her 
chair.

&quot;Falling for what?&quot; Naomi asked.

&quot;JEALOUS GAME.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Naomi nodded, sipping her drink.

 On the dance floor, Quistis found out how far behind she&#146;d fallen on 
the latest trends during her yearlong absence. However, being a fast 
learner she was soon moving with the best of them.

&quot;That Fujin, she seems to be a real loner, how&#146;d you two meet?&quot; Ayane 
asked candidly, before casually pushing away a half drunken lout with 
amorous intentions.

&quot;Hyne I hate drunks&#133;&quot; She scowled, before getting back into the beat.

&quot;You were saying?&quot; Quistis chuckled, being a bit more tolerant with 
would be dance partners.

&quot;Fujin, how&#146;d you meet her?&quot;

&quot;Long story.&quot; Quistis called out, having to speak loudly over the music.

&quot;Judging by the rings I take it you two are serious?&quot;

&quot;As a heart attack.&quot; Quistis winked, still moving to the beat.

Ayane simply smirked and followed her lead.

&quot;That&#146;s, good to hear.&quot;

&quot;What about you and Naomi?&quot;

&quot;We&#146;re doing okay; she can be obnoxious at times. She&#146;s still young, 
that and her dad spoils her.&quot;

&quot;Her dad, is it true that he runs this place?&quot;

&quot;Who? Mr. Jennings?&quot;

&quot;Jennings?&quot; Quistis gawked. &quot;Alexander Jennings, he&#146;s her dad!?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that&#146;s him.&quot;

&quot;Gracious, he&#146;s worth several billon!&quot;

&quot;A lot more than that actually. Naomi tells me his company took over all 
of Czar Industry&#146;s contracts after its collapse. I even heard they&#146;re 
working on something big in Esthar.&quot;

&quot;Imagine that&#133;&quot; Quistis mumbled quietly, not really enjoying being 
reminded of the Luccian disaster.

&quot;Enough about all of that, tell me about yourself? What do you do when 
you&#146;re not out saving the world?&quot; Ayane asked curiously.

&quot;Oh please.&quot; Quistis blushed, laughingly. &quot;I do what I have to, we all 
do.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re humble, that&#146;s a good quality.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, but to answer your question, I teach.&quot;

&quot;Teacher, ah, that&#146;s good, enriching young minds.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;d like to think so, but Fujin would tell you otherwise I bet.&quot;

&quot;Fujin.&quot; Ayane perked. &quot;Tell me she&#146;s a student?&quot;

&quot;Uh&#133;used to be.&quot;

&quot;Teacher, students affair, and whips&#133; how risqu&eacute;. You&#146;re a dangerous 
woman Miss Trepe.&quot;

&quot;All right now.&quot; Quistis laughed. &quot;I get enough of that at home.&quot;

**********************

&quot;They seem to be hitting it off.&quot; Naomi noted as she peered through the 
yellowish tint of her glass. Fujin nodded, a poured another glass of 
wine, Quistis was right, it was good, though she was beginning to think 
she may have over did it, everything seemed washed out and the sounds of 
the nightclub where sounding as though they where being played 
underwater.

&quot;You okay over there?&quot; Naomi chuckled, pouring herself another drink as 
well.

&quot;FINE.&quot; Fujin mumbled.

&quot;Hardly, you look like you&#146;re about ready to drop, and only after two 
glasses at that, you must not drink that much.&quot;

&quot;RARELY.&quot;

&quot;We told you to sip it.&quot;

&quot;NAOMI.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;QUIET.&quot;

 A long moment of silence passed and Fujin spent it, staring 
thoughtfully off into space while Naomi scanned the crowd curiously 
before focusing on Fujin once more.

&quot;You know what?&quot;

&quot;NO I DON&#146;T.&quot;

&quot;Cute.&quot; Naomi scowled lightly, but kept talking. &quot;If you don&#146;t mind me 
saying so I have to say, that Quistis is&#133;&quot;

&quot;I MIND.&quot; Fujin snapped, causing her shrink back slightly.

&quot;I was just going to complement her.&quot;

&quot;I KNOW.&quot;

&quot;I think I know your problem.&quot; Naomi hiccupped, wagging a finger at her. 
&quot;You have trust issues.&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Oh no, no, don&#146;t lie to me&#133; wait, what?&quot;

&quot;AGREED.&quot;

&quot;No, no, no, you&#146;re not supposed to agree, who taught you how to argue?&quot;

&quot;NAOMI, DRUNK.&quot;

&quot;Fujin, moody.&quot; Naomi frowned cutely, tottering in her seat. &quot;I&#146;m 
perfectly fine thank you much.&quot; She proclaimed, before continuing her 
interrogation. &quot;Do you trust anyone then?&quot;

&quot;TRUST QUISTIS.&quot; Fujin said heavily. &quot;NOT STRANGERS.&quot;

&quot;Oh so what? I&#146;m a stranger then?&quot;

&quot;JUST STRANGE.&quot;

&quot;Okay now you&#146;re being mean. You know what, I originally thought you 
were just shy or something, but now I&#146;m thinking you&#146;re just a grouch.&quot; 
Naomi pouted then resting her head on her arms dejectedly. Fujin took a 
breath and shifted slightly in her seat, the girl reminded her of Aeka, 
and the realization softened her demeanor.

&quot;APOLOGY.&quot; She mumbled quietly.

&quot;Accepted!&quot; Naomi beamed instantly, then looked out at the dance floor 
curiously.

&quot;I wonder what they&#146;re talking about?&quot; Naomi chattered.

&quot;UNKNOWN.&quot;

&quot;Fujin?&quot;

&quot;NAOMI.&quot;

&quot;Can I ask a question?&quot;

&quot;DEBATABLE.&quot;

&quot;Seriously.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot;

&quot;You promise you won&#146;t get mad.&quot;

&quot;NO.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re harsh you know that.&quot;

&quot;YES.&quot;

&quot;Okay fine then. No offense, but why do you talk like that?&quot;

Fujin looked up sourly.

&quot;Great, now you&#146;re mad.&quot; Naomi sulked.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; She answered, taking another drink before continuing.

&quot;ALWAYS THIS WAY.&quot; She explained, not wishing to go into details.

&quot;Fair enough.&quot; Naomi nodded agreeably.

Ayane and Quistis returned to the table in good spirits. Ayane wore an 
amused smiled while Quistis was laughing hysterically.

&quot;FUNNY?&quot; Fujin asked curiously.

&quot;You could say so, apparently Miss Ayane here, is a master of dirty bar 
jokes.&quot;

&quot;MUST BE PROUD.&quot; Fujin said sarcastically.

&quot;Yeah, four years as a bartender will do that. My mother was so proud.&quot;

&quot;You two seemed like you were having fun?&quot; Naomi said coyly, while 
sipping her drink.

&quot;INDEED.&quot; Fujin agreed.

&quot;You were invited.&quot; Quistis replied with a snobbish air.

&quot;I can&#146;t believe you let that guy get away with grabbing your ass&#133;&quot; 
Ayane growled.

&quot;WHAT!?&quot; Fujin shouted.

&quot;Oh great, I told you not to mention that.&quot;

&quot;WHO!&quot;

&quot;Oh wow, would you look at Miss never gets jealous.&quot; Naomi whistled.

&quot;That&#146;s cute, Fu, really.&quot; Quistis giggled, taking a drink. &quot;It was 
harmless, besides that probably made his night.&quot;

Fujin&#146;s gaze widened and she shook her head. &quot;NEVER UNDERSTAND.&quot;

&quot;Amen.&quot; Naomi smiled, chiming her glass against hers.

&quot;We&#146;ll girls it&#146;s been fun.&quot; Quistis yawned, finishing her drink.

&quot;Oh you&#146;re leaving?&quot; Ayane frowned.

&quot;Yes, me and Fu, have an appointment.&quot;

&quot;But it&#146;s still early.&quot; Naomi whined.

Fujin quickly stood and tottered slightly.

&quot;Easy.&quot; Ayane laughed, bracing her by putting a steady hand on her 
shoulder.

&quot;Someone had too much to drink.&quot; Quistis smirked. &quot;Are you going to be 
okay?&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;I see why you don&#146;t drink now, you can&#146;t handle it.&quot;

&quot;Told you!&quot; Naomi shouted triumphantly.

&quot;SHUT UP.&quot; Fujin blurted walking over to Quistis side, where she 
promptly rested her head on her shoulder.

&quot;You&#146;ll be okay once you get moving.&quot; Quistis chuckled, running a hand 
through her hair.

&quot;Well it&#146;s been fun getting to know you, how long are you guys going to 
be here?&quot; Ayane asked curiously.

&quot;Three more days.&quot; Naomi answered, earning intense looks from all 
present.

&quot;What? I took a peek at the books after I talked to you earlier.&quot; She 
explained quickly.

&quot;STALKER&#133;&quot; Fujin mumbled, moving behind Quistis to peer over her 
shoulder.

&quot;Anyway, you guys have a good night. Oh and hey, I&#146;ll be out at the ice 
rink tomorrow, you should both come check it out.&quot;

&quot;Not a bad idea?&quot; Quistis admitted, then looked to Fujin curiously. 
&quot;What do you think.&quot;

&quot;WHATEVER&#133;&quot; She mumbled anew, watching Naomi with a steely gaze.

&quot;Let me get her out of here.&quot; Quistis laughed. &quot;You guys take care.&quot; She 
waved.

&quot;Bye!&quot; Naomi waved as the two left.

Once alone, Ayane sat down and regarded her thoughtfully.

&quot;Well?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Naomi asked.

&quot;I think Quistis liked me, what do you think?&quot; Ayane smiled richly, from 
under the tangle of her hair.

&quot;I guess so, think we should ask them?&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t know yet, I don&#146;t know how it would go. I really like them, I&#146;d 
hate to make them mad.&quot;

&quot;We can wait then.&quot; Naomi suggested.

&quot;What about Fujin, any luck?&quot;

&quot;Ugh, no I think she hate my guts.&quot;.

&quot;Nah, I think she&#146;s just cautious, she&#146;ll warm up to you.&quot;

&quot;I hope so, she seems cool enough.&quot;

&quot;Ah well, who knows, either way it&#146;s about time something interesting 
happened around here.&quot; Ayane smiled darkly, leaning back in her chair.

*************************

Fujin was more than thrilled to find that the beach was vacant. Most of 
the stations guests were either hitting the clubs or attending a concert 
that had been being advertised.

&quot;Lucky us.&quot; Quistis smiled, slipping out of her heels.

&quot;YAY!&quot; Fujin grinned, kicking off her shoes before scampering out to the 
waters edge.

&quot;Don&#146;t go falling in, I&#146;d hate to see you drown drunk.&quot;

&quot;NOT DEEP&quot; Fujin announced wading out until the water swept over her 
ankles.

&quot;Oh your outfit, you&#146;re going to ruin it!&quot;

&quot;OKAY.&quot; Fujin shrugged, then slipped out of her pants.

&quot;Whoa!&quot; What are you doing!?&quot; Quistis blurted, her eyes bulging.

&quot;SWIM.&quot; Fujin announced, as she casually stripped out of her remaining 
clothes and tossed them to safety.

&quot;Are you serious?&quot;

&quot;COME ON.&quot; Fujin laughed, then jumped into the water.

&quot;Why not.&quot; Quistis giggled, then followed her lead.

The minute she hit the water she regretted it.

&quot;It&#146;s freezing, are you trying to kill me!&quot; She shrieked, as she stood 
up shivering.

&quot;OVERREACTING.&quot; Fujin laughed, swimming up to her.

&quot;Whatever.&quot; Quistis complained, wading out deeper until she was up to 
her shoulders. Fujin dunked down the came up before her, then wrapped 
her arms around her neck warmly.

&quot;LOOK.&quot; She said quietly, pointing to the how the large expanse of stars 
overhead was reflected perfectly in the dark water.

&quot;It&#146;s gorgeous.&quot; Quistis admitted, kissing softly.

Fujin shivered, and pressed closer.

&quot;Hey, who goes there?&quot; A man, a security guard shouted, shining a light 
on them.

&quot;ACK!&quot; Fujin sputtered as Quistis ducked underwater.

&quot;Hey, get out of there, didn&#146;t you read the sign, no swimming after 
hours!&quot;

The guard yelled. Quistis peeked her head out of the water.

&quot;Sorry sir, we didn&#146;t know.&quot; She offered meekly.

&quot;Yeah, yeah, move it, now!&quot;

&quot;Um, that would be kind of awkward.&quot; Quistis explained.

The guard looked about ready to have a fit.

&quot;You two better not be skinning dipping.&quot;

&quot;Um&#133;&quot;

&quot;SO?&quot; Fujin barked.

&quot;Oh for the love of&#133; Get a room or something. Young people nowadays.&quot; He 
ranted, before pausing.

&quot;You know what, never mind.&quot; He grumbled, throwing his hands into the 
air in frustration. &quot;I give up, you folks don&#146;t listen. Do what you 
want, I hope you drown.&quot; He ranted, and then stormed off into the night.

Quistis and Fujin looked mortified a moment then regarded each other.

&quot;What the hell was that about?&quot; Quistis blinked.

&quot;SHOULD DRESS.&quot; Fujin noted; making sure the guard was long gone.

&quot;Um yeah, that&#146;d be a good idea.&quot; Quistis mumbled regretfully.

 Once dressed, the two sprawled out on pristine sand and looked into the 
heavens to watch the stars.

&quot;Well&#133;&quot; Quistis said quietly after a long silence.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Fujin mumbled with a yawn.

&quot;It&#146;s been an interesting day hasn&#146;t it.&quot;

&quot;UNDERSTATEMENT.&quot;

&quot;What do you think of Naomi and Ayane? You haven&#146;t mentioned them at all 
since we left the restaurant.&quot;

&quot;UNKNOWN.&quot;

&quot;Surely you must have an opinion. I personally think Naomi has a thing 
for you.&quot;

&quot;TOLD YOU SO.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah you did.&quot;

&quot;STRANGE PAIR.&quot;

&quot;We&#146;re ones to talk.&quot; Quistis smiled. &quot;Do you think we should take Ayane 
up on the ice skating tomorrow?&quot;

&quot;UP TO YOU.&quot;

&quot;No it&#146;s not.&quot;

&quot;DON&#146;T CARE.&quot;

&quot;Liar.&quot; Quistis chuckled. &quot;Come on, tell the truth.&quot;

&quot;WE CAN.&quot;

&quot;I think we should go, just because it&#146;s fun and to be honest, I want to 
see you fall on your ass a few times.&quot;

&quot;SADIST.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know. So are we going or not?&quot;

&quot;FINE.&quot; Fujin finally answered.

&quot;You sure?&quot;

&quot;WHAT COULD HAPPEN?&quot;

&quot;You&#146;d be surprised.&quot; Quistis laughed. &quot;I bet it&#146;ll be interesting 
regardless though.&quot; She added, before rolling atop her then kissing her 
sweetly on the lips.

&quot;PERHAPS.&quot;  Fujin smiled softly then pulled her down into a tight 
embrace.</pre>
