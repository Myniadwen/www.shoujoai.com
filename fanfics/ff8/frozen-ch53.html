Fujin stood naked in the shower, letting the steaming water flow over 
her, hoping in vain that it would wash away her confusion.

&quot;Why?&quot; She wondered, searching, hoping for some answer.

&quot;Running again?&quot; A quiet voice spoke, her voice, naked, pure, honest, 
speaking accusations to her subconscious.

&quot;She gave up on me.&quot;

&quot;You should have said something ya know. You keep her in the dark, act 
all weird, what did ya think would happen?&quot; A new voice told her. She 
frowned slightly.

&quot;Raijin, brother.&quot; She realized, and frowned, always presumptuous, he 
never understood.

&quot;I lowered my defenses, even though I knew better. She couldn&#39;t wait to 
get rid of me. I was foolish to think someone could love me.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t believe that.&quot; It was her voice, soft melodic, pushing 
through the pain.

&quot;Quistis.&quot; Fujin realized and then sealed it away. &quot;Betrayed me, gave me 
up, used me and threw me away, just like the others. Seifer at least 
didn&#39;t pretend.&quot;

&quot;See, you do have a mind in that frumpy little head.&quot; Seifer this time, 
somehow she wasn&#39;t surprised. He had a habit of worming his way into bad 
situations.

&quot;Hate you.&quot; She thought, hoping to banish his memory.

&quot;You loved me once, come back, Quistis obviously doesn&#39;t want you. You 
should be happy I&#39;ve lowered my standards. No one else would have you, 
you&#146;re a freak.&quot;

As always he would not be denied, he knew how to get to her, how to hurt 
her.

&quot;A freak, cold, ugly, unwanted.&quot;

&quot;I want you.&quot; Quistis again. &quot;I need you.&quot;

&quot;HURT ME!&quot; Fujin remembered screaming, and how her throat burned, just 
like her heart.

&quot;Go away, no one wants you here.&quot; Rinoa now, Fujin had to wonder was the 
woman heartless, cruel, or perhaps just honest.

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have come back.&quot;

&quot;Idiot, she needs you, she was dead before you came!&quot; Even Xu, Fujin 
sighed. Quistis oldest friend, who else knew her better.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid, I don&#39;t want to be hurt anymore. I trusted her, she gave up 
on me&quot; Fujin feared, worried, loved, she didn&#39;t know what to think or 
do.

&quot;That&#39;s so typical, and here I thought you were strong. Your just a 
scared little girl, just go away, go crawl into a hole a bury yourself 
in your denial.&quot; Selphie, loud, obnoxious, Fujin at least had to respect 
her honesty.

&quot;What if I do? Maybe I should, it would be best.&quot;

&quot;THEN YOU DIE.&quot; Her own voice, cold, unfeeling, harsh, and soulless. &quot;Do 
I sound like that to everyone.&quot; She wondered sadly.

&quot;YOU DIE.&quot; Again her voice, always mechanical yet accusatory.

&quot;And I win.&quot; Seifer, Fujin could hear him laughing at her in her mind.

&quot;I&#39;ll die.&quot; Quistis, she was crying, tears of anguish and loss.

&quot;All things die, I have no fear of death.&quot; Fujin thought bitterly trying 
to convince herself.

&quot;I used to think that way, it&#39;s wrong.&quot; Squall, foolish but wise, a life 
of contradiction and yet, he surpassed his limitations.

&quot;I&#39;m not like you, I&#39;m weak, frightened, worthless.&quot;

&quot;We all fear out limits gal, it&#39;s how we deal with it that makes us 
strong.&quot; Irvine a kind hearted dreamer, he make life seem so easy.

&quot;I&#39;m not strong, not anymore, I have no protection.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll protect you. If you let me.&quot; Quistis, loving, foolish.

&quot;How can I? You let me fall once already.&quot;

&quot;Last chance, I&#39;ll still have you, all you have to do is come.&quot; Seifer, 
arrogant, prideful, I&#39;d be just another trophy a possession.

&quot;I&#39;d have purpose again.&quot; Fujin thought bitterly.

&quot;You may as well be a whore then.&quot; Nicole, kindly but able to wield 
truth like a knife. Fujin winced at the realization but didn&#39;t care.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter anymore.&quot;

&quot;That just sucks and you suck for thinking it.&quot; Zell, simple, to the 
point, is he a friend?

&quot;Am I wrong, is this all my fault?&quot; Fujin thought, growing weary.

&quot;There will be times in life were things will be hard and you&#39;ll be 
hurting. You&#39;ll want answers to questions no one can answer for you. You 
have to search within yourself to find those answers.&quot; An unknown voice, 
feminine, soothing, and familiar. Fujin sighed as she remembered.

&quot;Mother.&quot; She held herself and wept quietly. &quot;I miss you, you always 
knew how to make things better. I wonder what you&#39;d think if you saw me 
now? Would you be ashamed of me? I&#39;m so different now from how I was 
then.&quot;

&quot;No you&#39;re not, deep down you&#39;re the same. You&#39;re just hiding, things 
are getting serious and you&#39;re afraid.&quot; Mother, always caring but stern, 
Fujin had never been able to deny her.

&quot;Why.&quot; Fujin shivered in misery, she didn&#39;t know how to deal with the 
anguish she was feeling now. Physical pain she had learned to deal with, 
but this, this pain was far worse and it threatened to consume her.

**********************

Class was hell. The last thing Quistis wanted to do after a night of 
crying was to get up and teach. Somehow she managed; Fujin surprisingly 
enough was there also, which gave her a little hope that the damage 
she&#39;d done wasn&#39;t irrevocable.

She had hoped that Fujin would stay and talk, sadly she was 
disappointed. Fujin left as soon as the others did and without a word.

&quot;Hi Miss Trepe!&quot; Royce smiled hugely, Aeka and the other Treppies; Rinoa 
included stood attentively behind him. Quistis looked at the bunch 
warily but remained silent.

&quot;So any word yet!?&quot; He asked eagerly.

&quot;About?&quot;

&quot;The mission agenda.&quot;

&quot;Not yet. I&#39;ll keep you informed.&quot; Quistis answered in a somewhat 
autonomous tone. Aeka looked at her companions then back to Quistis.

&quot;Are you okay Miss Trepe?&quot; She asked worriedly.

&quot;Yeah Quisty you seem tired.&quot; Rinoa frowned then balked. &quot;Er.. I mean 
Miss Trepe.&quot;

&quot;I was up late.&quot; Quistis smirked.

&quot;You should get some sleep.&quot; Rinoa said. Aeka nodded in agreement.

&quot;My folks sent me some kick but herbal tea, I&#39;ll share some with you. 
It&#39;s guaranteed to cure what ails you.&quot; Royce chuckled.

&quot;Ew it&#39;s not that stuff that tastes like horseradish is it.&quot; Aeka said 
sourly.

&quot;It does not!&quot; Royce scowled.

&quot;Come on guys lets leave her be.&quot; Rinoa said motherly.

&quot;Yeah okay.&quot; Royce agreed. &quot;See you tomorrow Miss Trepe hope you get to 
feeling better.&quot;

&quot;Call me later.&quot; Rinoa waved cheerily as they left.

Quistis waited a moment in silence to gather her thoughts before 
scooping up her papers and leaving.

********************

Xu, Squall and Quistis had gathered in Cid&#39;s office. The headmaster 
looked perplexed and somewhat worried.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what to tell you.&quot; He sighed.

&quot;Bad news I take it?&quot; Xu frowned.

&quot;Depends on you definition.&quot; Cid said, turning his computer monitor 
around to face them. The screen showed news footage of burning police 
cars and feeling officers. &quot;This is footage from Dollet.

&quot;Wonderful.&quot; Quistis sighed dully.

&quot;Another war?&quot; Squall asked.

&quot;Unknown, but I can tell you what I do know. A little after sundown 
yesterday a Dollet police officer, investigating a disturbance attempted 
to gain entrance to the Czar weapons facility.&quot;

&quot;Luccian&#39;s dad&#39;s place eh?&quot; Xu asked.

&quot;One and the same.&quot; Cid nodded. &quot;I got some information from Mayor 
Eshorn, apparently the officer was refused entry to investigate.&quot;

&quot;What kind of disturbance was the officer investigating?&quot; Squall asked.

&quot;Explosion and probable fires, some residents in area claim to have 
heard screaming.&quot; Cid answered, wiping his glasses awkwardly.

&quot;What does this have to do with us though?&quot; Quistis asked sourly, she 
was in a highly aggravated state and could care less what was going on 
in Dollet at the moment.

&quot;Well Miss Trepe.&quot; Cid said firmly. &quot;For one thing it appears that your 
former student has assumed control his fathers business. He was the one 
who refused the officer entry.&quot;

&quot;With all do respect sir, Quistis is right, this sounds like a matter 
for the Dollet authorities.&quot; Squall shrugged.

&quot;True, but this has moved beyond any investigation. During the night it 
was confirmed that no one working at the plant around the time of the 
incident returned home. Around seven this morning officers returned to 
the plant with warrants only to be opened fired upon by persons inside 
the facility.&quot; Cid leaned back in his chair and eyed them seriously. 
&quot;The mayor has asked for our assistance, Dollet doesn&#39;t have the 
resources to launch a strike against such a fortified target.&quot;

&quot;Well this is interesting, what are we going be going up against?&quot; Xu 
asked.

&quot;It&#39;s pretty ugly to be honest, but not beyond our capabilities. The 
main problem is that we have no idea if an outside force has taken the 
plant or if it is an internal matter.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s internal.&quot; Seifer said, announcing his presence in the doorway. 
Quistis turned to regard him with such malice Xu was worried she was 
going to attack him.

&quot;Seifer has something to tell us.&quot; Edea said smoothly, appearing behind 
him. The two made their way inside and Cid looked at them curiously.

&quot;I see you&#39;re feeling better.&quot; He noted.

&quot;I have a clue as to what&#39;s going on in Dollet.&quot; Seifer smirked smugly.

&quot;And how would you know that?&quot; Xu asked with obvious skepticism.

&quot;A little bird told me.&quot; He chuckled.

&quot;Get to the point.&quot; Squall said, obviously in no mood for games.

&quot;It&#39;s just like in her memories.&quot; Seifer explained.

&quot;What!?&quot; Xu blinked.

&quot;Ultimecia, ask Edea she knows it too.&quot; Seifer smiled.

&quot;He is correct, it is as she planned.&quot; Edea sighed sadly. &quot;I fear I did 
not know how this would unfold until it was too late.&quot;

Squall frowned and stood this was going to be bad; he knew it in his 
gut.

&quot;Before you explain anymore I want everyone gathered on the bridge.&quot; He 
said standing up to leave.

&quot;I&#39;ll round them up.&quot; Quistis huffed. She stood to leave only to have 
Seifer bar her path.

&quot;I want to talk to you later, I need you help.&quot; He smiled politely.

She pushed past him without a word. Seifer stood confused and more than 
slightly pissed.

&quot;What the hell&#39;s her problem?&quot; He grumbled.

&quot;You.&quot; Xu sneered, pushing past him also.

&quot;Damn it I&#39;m about sick of!&quot; He shouted.

&quot;Let it go.&quot; Squall said grabbing his arm and peering at him sternly.

&quot;Son of a.&quot; Seifer growled jerking free. &quot;I&#39;ll be on the bridge.&quot;

The youths left the office leaving Edea and Cid alone.

&quot;What is this about Edea?&quot; Cid asked worriedly.

&quot;Griever.&quot; Edea replied darkly.

************

Zell lay on his back under the paneling of Ragnarok&#39;s cockpit, half 
buried in a tangle of wires and computer boards. Nicole sat in the 
co-pilot seat busily organizing a tray full of microchips and other 
small devices. Fujin meanwhile lay in floor on her stomach under the 
main computer. Quietly she held soldering iron, trying to reconnect a 
multitude severed electrical pathways. Nicole was chattering away 
inanely about something but Fujin&#39;s mind was elsewhere. She had hoped 
working on repairs to the Ragnarok would keep her mind distracted, and 
off troublesome thoughts. Sadly it failed and she was soon lost in 
thought, while moving about her work in a robotic fashion.

&quot;I said how&#39;s it going!&quot; Zell shouted again, snapping her back to the 
present.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin barked annoyed.

&quot;How, Is, It, Going.&quot; Zell said with deliberate slowness, causing Nicole 
to giggle softly.

&quot;PANEL 7 REPAIRED.&quot; Fujin grumbled.

&quot;Thanks, that was fast.&quot; Zell grinned at her from under his nest of 
cables.&quot;

Fujin&#39;s response was not one he was expecting, she jumped up in a 
hissing fit as sparks and bolts of electricity shot into her 
unsuspecting arm.

&quot;DAMN!&quot; She shouted and promptly kicked the side of the hull as hard as 
she could. A burst of pain shot through her foot causing her to stumble 
and fall onto her hands and knees.

&quot;DAMN!&quot; She roared again in a mix of pain, outrage and loss. Something 
about her outburst seemed wholly out the ordinary for her, causing Zell 
and Nicole to trade wary glances. Fujin breathed heavily, mumbling 
something over and over, to quiet for them to understand.

&quot;What should we do?&quot; Zell whispered worriedly to Nicole.

She looked flabbergasted and shrugged helplessly.

&quot;You okay over there?&quot; she asked softly.

Fujin slammed her fist into the floor and shook her head.

&quot;I&#39;M FINE!&quot; She spat bitterly and sniffed.

&quot;Right, um.&quot; Zell frowned. &quot;You got the power for the aft section going, 
good work.&quot; He said trying to sound optimistic.

Fujin stood and took a deep breath.

&quot;FINE.&quot; She repeated again as if trying to convince herself.

&quot;Let&#39;s take a break guys.&quot; Nicole said cheerily, walking over to Fujin. 
With a smile she put a hand on the woman&#39;s shoulder and leaned close.

&quot;Want to talk about it?&quot; She whispered.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin said gruffly.

&quot;You&#39;re stressing over something.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin scoffed and straightened.

&quot;I&#39;m not going to pretend to be an expert but even I can tell 
something&#39;s wrong.&quot;

Fujin couldn&#39;t respond and merely shook her head.

&quot;You ladies want to go grab a bite to eat?&quot; Zell said eagerly, wiping 
his hands on a towel.

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot; Fujin said simply.

&quot;All senior SEED report to the bridge!&quot; It was Quistis, her voice 
echoing over the intercom.

&quot;Crap in a hat.&quot; Zell sighed. &quot;Sorry babe got to go.&quot; He smirked and 
kissed Nicole on the cheek.

&quot;Alright keep out of trouble.&quot; Nicole grinned as he rushed off. She 
looked to Fujin and shrugged. &quot;I guess it&#39;s just you and me then.&quot;

***********************

&quot;Alright we&#39;re all here, what&#39;s the scoop?&quot; Selphie asked excitedly as 
everyone gathered on the bridge.

&quot;Ask Seifer he has all the answers.&quot; Xu said snidely, thumbing in his 
direction.

&quot;Lets get this over with.&quot; Squall sighed. &quot;Seifer, how about you tell us 
what you know.&quot;

&quot;Um boss, he&#39;s crazy.&quot; Irvine whispered to him.

&quot;Ultimecia freed it.&quot; Seifer shrugged simply.

&quot;I take it you fixed his noggin.&quot; Irvine amended looking, curiously at 
Edea.

She silenced him and nodded towards Seifer. &quot;Listen.&quot;

&quot;Again with Ultimecia.&quot; Zell frowned, rolling his eyes.

&quot;Freed what?&quot; Selphie wondered aloud.

&quot;You all called it Griever although it has many names, Tyranous, 
Darkness, Lost one, Lust, Suffering.&quot; Seifer said with a cryptic smile.

&quot;He&#39;s crazy still, you didn&#39;t bake him long enough.&quot; Zell chuckled to 
Edea.

&quot;Zip it.&quot; Squall said curtly.

Zell shot back, &quot;What do you mean freed it? I can tell you that... that 
Griever thing was free to begin with. Hell, it freely stomped the crap 
out of me.&quot; He grumbled in disbelief.

&quot;In her time yes.&quot; Seifer scowled, then looked at a Squall with smugly. 
&quot;You know what I&#39;m getting at don&#39;t ya Squall. You spent time in the 
slipstream just like I did.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s talking about temporal mechanics.&quot; Nida blurted.

&quot;Flyboy gets a brownie.&quot; Seifer smiled and clapped sarcastically.

&quot;Seifer just tell them.&quot; Edea frowned.

&quot;You know what, I&#39;m sick of you.&quot; Zell said with no amount of tact.

Quistis sat listening dully, she could honestly care less how this 
started. She only wanted things to get back to normal. She missed Fujin 
already and that weighed more on her than Griever, Seifer or Ultimecia.

&quot;You&#39;re looking thrilled.&quot; Selphie whispered to her.

Quistis just looked at her from under hooded eyes.

&quot;Ultimecia, she&#39;s from far in the future and Griever is free in her 
time.&quot; Seifer explained

&quot;I see were this is going.&quot; Selphie sighed in dismay.

&quot;The only reason it was free for her to use was because someone let it 
loose.&quot; Seifer shrugged.

&quot;I hate trying to figure out this sort of mess.&quot; Irvine frowned rubbing 
his head.

&quot;But we killed Griever, and Ultimecia.&quot; Zell said, moaned as if someone 
cheated him out of money.

&quot;Yes in the future. Ultimecia needed Griever free sometime in the past 
so she can use him in the future. That, is what you all faced and 
defeated.&quot; Edea pointed out smoothly.

&quot;Great, so she freed him?&quot; Irvine asked.

&quot;No the Centra sealed Griever in a place unreachable by of a sorceress.&quot; 
Edea answered.

&quot;When I was under Ultimecia&#39;s influence I became privy to some of her 
memories, one of which was her having freed Griever in the past. I had 
hoped to prevent such a thing.&quot; Seifer sighed in disappointment. &quot;Change 
what happened.&quot;

&quot;Looks like you failed man.&quot; Zell scoffed.

&quot;She had a guardian ready, to prevent someone from trying to stop her. 
She fried me the moment I went to the first temple.&quot;

&quot;The shadow Edea was talking about?&quot; Squall nodded.

&quot;Yes, she wanted the right kind of person to free Griever.&quot; Seifer 
answered.

&quot;Why didn&#39;t she have you do it?&quot; Irvine asked Edea curiously.

&quot;Because after so long in captivity Griever would be uncontrollable, 
he&#39;d most assuredly consume whoever freed him and take their place. 
Therefore banishing them into the Umbra. After which it would be 
expected to go on a rampage. It wouldn&#39;t do to have such an event going 
on while using me to gain power in Deling.&quot; Edea explained grimly.

&quot;Then who the hell let him loose and why now.&quot; Selphie asked.

&quot;Luccian.&quot; Cid said simply, tossing a shoebox to Squall. Squall caught 
it and looked at him quizzically.

&quot;What is that?&quot; Seifer asked walking over to investigate.

&quot;I had Quistis search his room. There&#39;s a few articles in there talking 
about some creature called Tyranous and other relics pertaining to 
Centra and Guardian Forces.&quot;

&quot;That sack of shit.&quot; Zell barked. &quot;I knew it, the low life, dirty 
little.&quot; Irvine clapped a hand over Zell&#39;s mouth and looked to Edea.

&quot;If you knew what was going on, why didn&#39;t you warn us. Hell I remember 
you even said something was coming but didn&#146;t explain.&quot; He asked.

&quot;I only knew something was about to occur. Like Seifer I shared a 
portion of her mind, but like I said, only so much could be gathered 
from those memories.&quot; She said apologetically.

&quot;So this Luccian guy did this.&quot; Seifer growled. &quot;Nice group of kids in 
your class Miss Trepe.&quot; He chuckled dryly tossing the shoebox at 
Quistis&#39;s feet.

&quot;Leave her alone.&quot; Xu snapped defensively. Quistis ignored all of them 
and was barely even followed the conversation.

&quot;So what&#39;s the plan boss?&quot; Selphie smirked. &quot;We go kill the monster, 
save the student?&quot;

&quot;This Luccian kid is already dead, only Griever remains. We must strike 
fast while he&#39;s still weakened from his imprisonment.&quot; Seifer said 
loudly.

&quot;I give the orders here and we aren&#39;t going off half cocked.&quot; Squall 
said gruffly. &quot;Quistis, is your class ready?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Quistis answered dryly.

&quot;Good, looks like we have their final test.&quot; He said offering a slight 
smirk.

&quot;You can&#39;t be serious.&quot; Zell balked.

&quot;Why not, the kids got to learn somehow.&quot; Irvine shrugged.

&quot;You are sending us too right?&quot; Selphie asked hopefully.

&quot;No, you&#39;re staying here.&quot; Squall ordered.

&quot;What!?&quot; Selphie said in disbelief.

&quot;Quistis pulled you off active duty, I respect her decision.&quot; Squall 
explained.

&quot;Hyne, thanks a lot Quistis.&quot; Selphie pouted. Quistis removed her 
glasses and rubbed the bridge of her nose idly.

&quot;Quistis, work with the other teachers and get all the trainee&#39;s ready. 
They should be able to handle securing the parameter and rescue any 
possible hostages. We&#39;ll send in an advanced team to deal with Griever 
directly.&quot;

&quot;It should be noted Griever is a creature of death, anyone fighting in 
its defense belong to the legions of the darkness.&quot; Edea said 
cryptically.

&quot;What the hell does that mean?&quot; Zell said, nearly freaking out at the 
myriad of possible meanings.

&quot;Undead.&quot; Seifer said with an overly dramatic flare.

&quot;Great.&quot; Zell sighed, making a disgusted face.

&quot;So who&#39;s making up the main strike team?&quot; Irvine asked.

&quot;Zell, Irvine, you&#39;re with me.&quot; Squall answered.

&quot;I&#39;m going too, this is my fight.&quot; Seifer shouted.

&quot;No, I can&#39;t have you running around, you&#39;re an unknown element.&quot; Squall 
said firmly.

&quot;Unknown, I&#39;m going damn it, this is my one chance to right the wrongs 
I&#39;ve done.&quot; Seifer shouted, sounding genuinely distraught.

Quistis laughed aloud.

&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; He frowned, turning slowly towards her.

&quot;You&#39;re full of it.&quot; She snarled venomously.

&quot;I&#39;m sick and tired of.....!&quot; Seifer started.

&quot;Both of you be quiet.&quot; Squall snapped; ending the argument before it 
even got started. &quot;Seifer, you&#39;re staying simple as that. You&#39;ll work 
with Xu on intelligence, give her any pertinent information you have.

&quot;I&#39;m not taking orders from you.&quot; Seifer laughed.

&quot;Then you&#39;re confined to quarters.&quot; Squall shrugged.

Seifer spat in disgust. &quot;Fine, you bastard, we&#39;ll play it your way.&quot;

&quot;Matron, if you would be so kind as to assist them.&quot; Squall asked, 
ignoring Seifer.

&quot;Of course child.&quot; Edea smiled demurely. Squall turned his attention to 
Irvine

&quot;Irvine, help Quistis get the recruits ready, assign them Guardians, 
gear and what ever supplies you deem necessary. I&#39;ll be ironing out the 
details with the forces in Dollet. Sir?&quot; Squall asked Cid respectfully.

&quot;Yes lad?&quot; Cid smiled perkily, a twinkle in his eye. He was obviously 
enjoying seeing Squall taking his leadership role with more grace.

&quot;I&#39;ll need your help with the mayor.&quot; Squall sighed, knowing he himself 
lacked any appreciable diplomatic skills.

&quot;I&#39;ll get right on it.&quot; Cid chuckled.

&quot;Zell, how&#39;s the Ragnarok?&quot; Squall asked. &quot;We could really use it for an 
insertion vehicle.&quot;

&quot;Aw dude she&#39;s a mess. We only got power to her systems, like an hour 
ago.&quot;

&quot;Can you get it airborne in two days, it&#39;ll take at least that long for 
us to get there in the Garden and make arrangements.&quot;

&quot;Two days?!&quot; Zell gulped. &quot;Ew man, perhaps, if I skip some stuff. She&#39;ll 
be ugly as hell and half her systems will unavailable.

&quot;Don&#39;t take any unnecessary risks now, I don&#39;t want you crashing while 
trying to deploy.&quot;

&quot;Have faith man, she&#39;s my baby.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m counting on you. Alright lets get to work.&quot;

&quot;HEY!&quot; Selphie shouted, sounding more than insulted.

&quot;What?&quot; Squall frowned.

&quot;What about me, you can&#39;t expect me to sit around eating peanut butter 
and getting fat.&quot; The small woman pouted sadly.

&quot;Um.&quot; Squall blinked.

&quot;You can help me and Fujin fix the Ragnarok.&quot; Zell chimed in cheerfully.

&quot;Good idea.&quot; Squall nodded. &quot;Get to it.&quot;

&quot;Great.&quot; Selphie grumbled.

************

&quot;Personally, I like to talk about my problems, but that&#146;s just me I 
guess, talk, talk talk. Zell thinks I think and talk to much.&quot; Nicole 
shrugged, taking a bite of her sundae. Fujin said nothing, content to 
just stare dully at her class of juice. Celest, having run into them on 
their way to the cafeteria tagged along to join them. &quot;Zell may have a 
point sugar.&quot; She laughed.

&quot;Hussy.&quot; Nicole giggled playfully.

&quot;Oh please, you just wish you could be like me. Aint I right Fujin 
dear?&quot;

&quot;DEAR?&quot; Fujin blinked, only half listening to their inane chatter.

&quot;Don&#39;t get you panties in a bunch hon, it&#39;s only a friendly term of 
endearment.&quot;

Fujin looked at her with a scathing expression but didn&#39;t respond.

&quot;She&#39;s exceptionally sour today. She not her normal friendly self&quot; 
Celest frowned worriedly at Nicole.

&quot;Don&#39;t poke fun, you&#39;ll just get her upset.&quot; Nicole murmured.

&quot;So what&#39;s got you bent out of shape, guy problems? It&#39;s that Seifer 
jerk ain&#39;t it, hon whatever he is to you, from what I hear tell, he&#39;s 
not worth it.&quot; She said clapping Fujin on the back. Fujin shirked from 
the touch slightly but tolerated it.

&quot;She&#39;s right.&quot; Nicole nodded knowingly. &quot;Celest might not know much but 
she knows guys.&quot;

Fujin looked at the two silently and wondered how she came to be in such 
a predicament. With one motion she downed the rest of her juice and 
stood.

&quot;Where you going?&quot; Nicole asked curiously.

&quot;RAGNAROK.&quot;

&quot;Oh, well, I&#39;ll be down shortly.&quot;

Fujin nodded solemnly and left the two women sitting, staring at each 
other.

&quot;Was it something I said?&quot; Celest paled.

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Nicole shrugged. &quot;Everyone keeps me in the dark.&quot;

&quot;I know how you feel.&quot; Celest chuckled.

*************************

Fujin had just made it hanger when Seifer caught up to her, his two 
guards trailing behind him. Frowning she folded her arms waiting for 
what ever lunacy he was about to spout. The first guard looked over to 
his companion and sighed.

&quot;Oh hell this again.&quot;

&quot;Five Gil says she slaps him this time.&quot; The second man muttered 
quietly.

&quot;Alright, your on.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you two assholes have somewhere else to be!&quot; Seifer yelled at 
them.

Taking advantage of the distraction Fujin slipped quietly away. Seifer 
turned just in time to see her shut the door leading to the hanger.

&quot;Wait damn it!&quot; Seifer cried out in frustration.

&quot;Ha!&quot; The second guard laughed triumphantly.

&quot;It&#39;s not over.&quot; The first noted as Seifer chased after her.

Taking long strides Fujin stormed over and retrieved a welding torch and 
goggles from a nearby workbench.

&quot;Fujin come on hold up.&quot; Seifer pleaded. Fujin looked at him with 
disinterest and donned her goggles. Without a word she lit the torch and 
knelt by one of the Ragnarok&#39;s disassembled landing struts.

&quot;I just want to talk, look, I don&#39;t have a lot of time I have to meet Xu 
later.&quot; Seifer said calmly kneeling by her side.

Fujin was oblivious to him and focused wholly on the task at hand.

&quot;What the hell is with the women around here, Xu bites my head off for 
no reason, Quistis looks like she wants to kill me, and someone I used 
to think of as a friend claims to hate me.&quot;

Fujin reached past him and retrieved a piece of steel cable.

&quot;Damn it Fu talk to me, why the sudden change in you?&quot; Seifer growled 
getting upset. &quot;I can tell how miserable you are, I know you&#39;re hurt and 
angry. Let me make it up to you. I promise things will be different, I&#39;m 
different now, if you&#39;d only let me prove it to you.&quot; He pleaded, almost 
pathetically, Fujin almost hated to see him do this to himself, but she 
didn&#39;t let they sway her resolve.

&quot;What do you want, I apologized, for everything. Just tell me, you only 
have to speak it.&quot; He reached out and put his hand on hers, lowering the 
torch.

&quot;Give me a chance, please.&quot;

Fujin breathed deep and switched off the blowtorch.

&quot;NO MORE.&quot; She said as softly as she could, not wanting to blow up at 
him. She was upset enough as it was and it would be far too easy to take 
it out on him. Although it would probably be therapeutic, she knew it 
would be wrong.

&quot;That&#146;s not fair.&quot; He frowned.

&quot;NOTHING IS.&quot; She countered.

&quot;I need you.&quot; He said softly.

&quot;FALSE.&quot;

&quot;I love you, you&#39;re all I could think about while I was away. Your face, 
your smell, the way you move.&quot;

&quot;LEAVE.&quot; Fujin sighed growing more and more annoyed.

&quot;Not until you admit you still love me.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re lips say no.&quot; He grinned. &quot;But what does you&#39;re heart say.&quot; He 
said smoothly before pulling her to him and kissing her firmly on the 
lips. There no doubt his kiss was a passionate one, Fujin could tell he 
meant everything he said. She on the other hand felt differently and 
calmly waited. Seifer slowly pulled away and looked at her. The kiss 
alone spoke volumes, cold and devoid of emotion on her part. The 
expression on her face sealed it; there was no anger, no love, no 
anything. Fujin looked down and turned on the torch.

&quot;WE DONE?&quot; She asked simply.

Seifer frowned and nodded sadly.

&quot;I guess so.&quot; He sighed turning to the guards who sat stone-faced. 
Behind them stood Zell, Squall, Selphie and Quistis.

&quot;Whoa.&quot; Zell blinked as Seifer approached.

&quot;I knew it.&quot; Selphie grumbled earning a guarded look from Squall.

Fujin watched the group a moment; emotionless, hidden then knelt and 
went back to work.

Quistis bristled but to her credit seemed calm on the outside.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what you people did to her.&quot; Seifer growled. &quot;But you can 
have her.&quot;

&quot;We didn&#39;t do anything pal. Lady looks to have made up her own mind.&quot; 
Zell snapped smartly.

&quot;Get out of my face.&quot; Seifer growled, shoving him back into Squall. 
Selphie immediately jumped forward ready to fight only to be pushed 
aside by Quistis who put a firm hand on Seifer&#39;s chest. Selphie was 
about to protest but the look on Quistis&#39;s face silenced her.

&quot;I know what you did you son of a bitch.&quot; She hissed at him.

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Seifer sighed; growing annoyed and bored 
with the constant accusations.

Selphie looked up curiously, unaccustomed to hearing such hatred in 
Quistis&#39;s voice.

&quot;Uh oh.&quot; She frowned looking at Squall.

&quot;It was all a lie, Fujin didn&#39;t fall those years ago. You threw her down 
that cliff.&quot; Quistis said venomously her voice shaking.

&quot;Such a stupid thing, I was so different then.&quot; He sighed regretfully. 
&quot;She must trust you a lot to have told you, I&#39;m envious. I love her you 
know. I tried to apologize, make amends, I&#39;d do anything for her.&quot; He 
looked back at Fujin sorrowfully and shook his head in dismay before 
looking back at Quistis.

She glared at him with such seething hatred it nearly startled him

&quot;I assume you&#39;re going to attack me now.&quot; He frowned and stood ready.

Quistis stood stiffly, her eyes darting over his face as her mind 
roiled. Squall wasn&#39;t sure what to do; any move on his part would 
probably make matters worse. Even Selphie was subdued by the intensity 
of the moment.

Finally Quistis relaxed and scowled bitterly.

&quot;No.&quot; She said with a disgusted look on her face. &quot;You&#39;re not worth it.&quot; 
She spat and turned away.

&quot;The hell he&#39;s not!&quot; Zell shouted in bewildered outrage, promptly 
socking Seifer right in the face. Seifer, caught completely unaware, 
fell like a sack of bricks. Zell pounced on him like a wild animal, 
fists flailing. Selphie&#39;s eyes went wide with shock and looked at 
Squall.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to do something!?&quot; She shouted.

&quot;Zell beat me to it.&quot; Squall said with a scowl and walked away. </pre>
