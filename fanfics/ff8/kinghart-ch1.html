<p>King’s  Heart</p>
<p>An  old dust filled room stood, the rest of the house completely gone except for  that one. It was as if time wanted to preserve that one and that one alone. A  shadow, almost nothing but a memory passed through the room, drifting to each  part of it. It gently caressed the bed where so many a night was spent alone  and then after, in the silent comfort of a partner who was willing to share a  memory, a tear, a life. A room where passion once took place that boiled down  to nothing but pure unlimited, undiluted love. A small red heart hung from the  bedpost that said in blue crayon “From X to Q” A small bear sat in the middle  of the bed, it’s age showing by the layer of dust on its fur and the wear and  tear of its clothing. Flowers wilted on a desk, long lost to death. The memory  caressed the paintings, faded but resilient. It came to rest on the chair, the  place where the two had first shared their thoughts and their love to each other.  Finally, it rested on two pictures. One of when they were little and smiling.  One girl, a brunette with a grin wide enough to take up most of her face, had  put bunny ears behind the other girl, a strawberry blond with a shy smile. So  much pain would befall those young children. The memory looked over at the  other picture, taken in secret. The two girls were wrapped in each other’s  arms, foreheads together and eyes closed. They were cherishing the moment,  silently suffering but not quite in pain. They had each other and the memory,  the spirit, thought back…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Quistis  sighed and leaned back against her chair. Cid was such a nice man, letting her  have her job back and all. Being a SeeD was a better paying job but she’d much  rather not see so much death. Then again, training children to kill wasn’t much  better but at least she could try to teach them morals. It sickened her to  think that another Seifer would spring out of her class. She placed her hand  over her face in a movement signifying that she was tired. Being an Instructor  wasn’t easy. She didn’t get the comforts that a SeeD had. Ever since Ultimecia  had been killed, SeeDs had it easy. A few more had been dispatched recently to  Timber to help liberate it further and the order had come from the big man  himself; Squall. Quistis wondered if it wasn’t an emotional decision but either  way, Squall paid for the troops himself. In a matter of days, Timber was free  as the trains it ran. She gave another sigh and turned her attention to the  foreboding pile of tests that she needed to grade. She cringed at the thought  of seeing yet another answer that said something along the lines of, “The  sorceress is dead, why do we need to take this test?” or even worse, little  hearts with her name in them. She nearly whimpered.</p>
<p>“Hard  day?” Quistis jumped at the voice. Xu walked in with two mugs of hot tea.  Quistis smiled at her old friend and sat up straight.</p>
<p>“You  could say that. I had one kid throw up all over the computer. Poor kid. On top  of that, it was because of a hang over and I had to give him detention as well  for underage drinking.” Xu scrunched up her nose in disgust.</p>
<p>“Ew…I’ll  bet that was nasty.” She said. Quistis sipped her tea and kept staring at the  papers. “So, whatcha thinking about?” Quistis leaned towards the papers.</p>
<p>“You  will grade yourselves…” she said to the papers in a fake fortune tellers voice.  “You will listen to me and grade yourselves…” Xu laughed.</p>
<p>“You  can try as hard as you want but they’re not going to grade themselves. Besides,  you’ve got all weekend, why grade them now?” Quistis pushed her glasses down  her nose and looked at Xu, smirking.</p>
<p>“That’s  precisely what makes me Quistis Trepe, excellent Instructor and object of  affection to Trepies and you are simply Xu. I get things done early.” She said  snootily. Xu batted at her playfully and sat down on the desk.</p>
<p>“You’re  mean,” she pouted. “I wish I had a fan club.”</p>
<p>“No.  No you don’t.” Quistis replied shaking her head and smiling. “They’re not a fan  club. They’re a cult. They follow my footsteps, shower me with meaningless  praises and swoon at everything I do. Trust me, it’s not fun.”</p>
<p>“Aw,  why not?” Xu whined. “I mean, not even Squall has his own fan club!”</p>
<p>“That’s  because he’s a recluse and Rinoa would be at anyone’s throat if they tried to  worship Squall. And plus, I drew the line when they attempted to sneak into my  room and auction my underwear.” Xu balked at the thought of it.</p>
<p>“What?!”  Quistis laughed.</p>
<p>“Exactly.  You do not want a fan club.”</p>
<p>“No  wonder I saw some of the guys waving a thong around…” Quistis shoved her  lightly.</p>
<p>“I  do not wear anything of the sort!” she said loudly. Xu giggled, looking at her  warily. “I don’t! It’s not like I’ve got anyone to impress or anything.”</p>
<p>“Ooooo,  now I know there’s someone on your mind. I didn’t mention anything about  impressing people. So, who is the person of your affections?” Quistis winced on  the inside, a little hurt by the thought of loving someone ever again but she  smiled on the outside and waved it away.</p>
<p>“There’s  no one on my mind. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a mountain of papers to  tackle and all of that needs to be done before I sleep.” She said, shooing Xu  out of the room.</p>
<p>“That’s  not fair, Quisty! You’re hiding something and I know it!” Quistis closed the  door and set it to lock. She walked back to her desk and collapsed on the  chair. She had no one to love. Who would love someone as cold as she was? She  sighed and looked once again at the stack of papers. <em>I should get straight  to work, it ought to put my thoughts on hold for a while.</em> She was a typical  workaholic only because she needed something to stave her memories and  thoughts. She worked to forget and she wished she could forget it all forever…</p>
<p>Quistis  finished the papers but felt drained of any energy. She stood up and stretched,  preparing for a good night’s sleep. When she exited the door, Xu was sitting  there, legs folded and waiting.</p>
<p>“Xu!”  she exclaimed with some surprise.</p>
<p>“Finally!  I thought you would never come out!” she said, getting up and yawning. “It’s  been two hours, Quistis…”</p>
<p>“You  didn’t have to wait for me.”</p>
<p>“No  I didn’t.” There was a strained silence after that and Quistis couldn’t bring  herself to look Xu in the eye. Finally, she cleared her throat and spoke.</p>
<p>“So,  you want to sleep over my place?” she asked.</p>
<p>“No  problem. We haven’t had a sleep over in such a long time, Quisty.” Xu  brightened and followed Quistis as she walked down the hallway towards the  elevator.</p>
