&quot;Sorry guys.&quot; Raijin exclaimed as he and Xu walked back into the hanger 
from which all the commotion started. Two figures waited patiently for 
him and looked eagerly as he approached.

&quot;What happened?&quot; The first figure, a large blocky man with a leathery 
face asked curiously.

&quot;You worried me to death.&quot; The said the other figure, a tall statuesque 
woman with dark skin, wavy black hair and piercing green eyes. Xu looked 
at the two curiously; both strangers had thick accents, which she could 
not place.

&quot;Friends of yours?&quot; She asked Raijin who was looking sheepish.

&quot;Sorry ya know. This is Jaya, Miguel, old friends of mine. We met in the 
Jocosta Mountains.&quot; He said, introducing them.

&quot;Guys, this is Xu, she&#39;s a SEED ya know.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve heard all about you.&quot; Jaya smiled.

&quot;Good things I hope...&quot; Xu mumbled, cutting Raijin a wary glance.

&quot;Oh course!&quot; Raijin shouted with a laughing bellow. &quot;I love you guys!&quot;

&quot;Um...well, that&#146;s nice.&quot; Xu blanched.

&quot;Excuse me my dear.&quot; Miguel said smoothly, pushing past the still 
guffawing Raijin. &quot;I&#39;ve heard wondrous about this place. Perhaps,&quot; He 
said with rich accent. &quot;A lovely lady such as yourself would be so kind 
as to show me around.&quot;

Xu blushed at the compliment and giggled.

&quot;Oh he&#39;s a charmer.&quot; She grinned at Raijin. &quot;Why is he hanging out with 
you?&quot;

&quot;Har, Har, that&#146;s not funny ya know.&quot; Raijin responded with a 
good-natured frown.

&quot;Um sure, I&#39;d be happy to.&quot; Xu said, taking Miguel up on his offer.

Miguel smiled lavishly and entwined his arm with hers causing Xu to 
giggle anew.

&quot;Yeah well you two stay out of trouble ya know!&quot; Raijin called to him, 
then turned to Jaya who watched in amusement.

&quot;My brother is such a...&quot; She started then frowned. &quot;What is the 
word...?&quot; She asked in a thick accent similar to Miguel&#39;s

&quot;Horn dog.&quot; Raijin chuckled.

&quot;Hoorn Dawg.&quot; Jaya repeated awkwardly.

&quot;Close enough.&quot; Raijin smiled. &quot;Come on, you have to meet my sister.&quot;

*************************

It was late, Doctor Kadowaki had left the clinic for the evening and 
Fujin found herself alone with Quistis. Quietly she sat in the floor and 
crossed her legs. She had, at one time been avidly into meditation; 
however, she had fallen out of practice around the time the fiasco with 
Ultimecia started. Of late though she found it helped her relax and keep 
focused, it also helped alleviate the stress she had endured, especially 
of late. Her brothers arrival wasn&#39;t wholly unexpected and not totally 
unwelcome, she did however hope he&#39;d not make a fuss upon his inevitable 
visit. She had just begun to drift when an odd sound caused her to open 
her eye. The sound was barely audible and sounded like waves crashing 
against the reef.

Normally she wouldn&#39;t have thought anything about it but Balamb Garden 
wasn&#39;t anywhere near the ocean. She chose to dismiss it as any number of 
things and closed her eye once more. Minutes passed by, and the only 
sound was that made by the quietly puffing machinery breathing life into 
Quistis&#39; weakened form.

&quot;I hope I&#39;m doing the right thing...&quot; Fujin thought dismally. She hated 
seeing her love in such a state. But she truly believed she could be 
saved, and so long as there was a chance, she wouldn&#146;t give up. She was 
fully aware of Ellone&#39;s and Kadowaki&#39;s growing skepticism. They, just 
like most everyone at Balamb thought her to be holding on out of some 
selfish but wholly understandable form of denial. They were wrong; she&#39;d 
never let Quistis suffer so if there was nothing that could be done.

&quot;I have to be right...&quot; She thought with a stubbornness. The strange 
encounter in Quistis&#39; mind was proof. A knock on the door jolted her out 
of her quiet reflections and she stood stiffly. Kadowaki was right, she 
had ignored her own recovery and she paid for it with stiff joints and 
constant muscle aches.

Leaving Quistis&#39; room, she headed to the front part of the clinic. The 
lights were out and she fumbled for the light switch before making her 
way to the entrance. Looking out through the closed window blinds, she 
frowned slightly. Raijin stood waiting eagerly with some stranger Fujin 
didn&#39;t recognize. With a sigh she opened the door and poked her head 
out.

&quot;IS LATE.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that late ya know.&quot; He smiled.

&quot;Hello.&quot; Jaya smiled, offering a hand. Fujin stared at it warily then 
shook it with noticeable reluctance.

&quot;This is Jaya.&quot; Raijin announced proudly. &quot;Jaya, this is my sister, 
Fujin.&quot;

Jaya looked between the two of them awkwardly, not seeing any 
resemblance.

&quot;Alubinoid.&quot; Jaya smiled, nodding her head.

Fujin started to shut the door in their face.

&quot;Um Albino...&quot; Raijin corrected, putting his hand on the door to stop it 
from shutting.

&quot;Aw come on Fu, she doesn&#39;t have the nuances of our language down yet. 
Can&#39;t we come in; I really want to see you. Xu told me what happened... 
I&#39;m sorry ya know.&quot;

Fujin took a breath and relented, motioning them to come in. Without 
warning, Jaya leaned down and kissed Fujin on each cheek, causing her to 
sputter in shock.

&quot;DESIST!&quot; She blurted, nearly striking the woman.

&quot;Oh hey, sorry!&quot; Raijin blushed, pulling Jaya back. &quot;That&#146;s just a 
custom, um a show of respect ya know!&quot; He explained quickly as Fujin 
stared at the somewhat confused woman.

&quot;Um... how&#39;s Miss Trepe? I hear she&#39;s not doin so good ya know...&quot; 
Raijin continued, his demeanor changing to one of worry.

&quot;ALIVE.&quot; Fujin mumbled awkwardly.

&quot;Can I see her? I&#39;d like to say Hi ya know.&quot;

Fujin frowned and studied him a moment. Folding her arms nervously, she 
nodded.

&quot;COME.&quot;

&quot;Hey wait here, please.&quot; Raijin said, kissing Jaya on the cheek. The 
woman nodded quietly and watched them as they walked back into Quistis&#39; 
room.

&quot;Aw no.&quot; Raijin sighed as he entered. Somehow, seeing Quistis in such a 
state made everything sink in. &quot;This isn&#39;t fair ya know...&quot; He 
whispered, throwing a large comforting arm around Fujin&#39;s shoulder. She 
accepted it and walked with him to her side.

&quot;Hi Miss Trepe, it&#39;s me Ray. I know it&#39;s been awhile and all but, ya 
know.&quot; He shrugged unsure what to say. &quot;You um...you need hurry up and 
get better, Fu misses you and so does everyone else.&quot; He sniffed sadly. 
&quot;Aw this isn&#39;t good at all... I suck at this sorta thing.&quot;

&quot;IS OKAY.&quot; Fujin smiled softly, resting her head against his shoulder.

******************

She was a woman with a mission. Checking herself out in the mirror,

Celest looked on in grim approval. She had squeezed herself into a 
slinky red number that accented her physique and charms while staying 
somewhat modest. She was only mildly looking forward to her dinner with 
Seifer, but knew it was something she needed to do, it was better than 
sulking around waiting for fairytales. Taking a breath, she steeled her 
resolve.

&quot;Let&#39;s get it over with...&quot; She mumbled sourly.

Among the many new additions to Balamb Garden, a proper restaurant was 
finally added, offering a change of pace for Staff and students alike. 
The catch being of course, one had to pay. Leaving her apartment, she 
walked quietly up the hall, her high heels clicking loudly in the empty 
corridor. She had purposely chose to meet Seifer late in the evening, 
that way there would be fewer chances of someone seeing them and asking 
unwanted questions.

When she arrived at the restaurant she was thankful that is was nearly 
empty, and half of the tables had their chairs up for the night. Seifer 
was waiting for her, sitting idly looking over a menu.

&quot;Hi.&quot; She mumbled.

&quot;Ah well...&quot; Seifer started but was caught off guard by how stunning she 
looked. &quot;Well hi there...&quot; He finished with a toothy grin. Standing up 
he pulled the seat out for her, which was a surprise. Sitting down, she 
placed her hands in her lap awkwardly.

&quot;Problem?&quot; Seifer asked curiously as he sat opposite of her.

&quot;Not at all.&quot; She smiled.

&quot;Nervous?&quot; He grinned. &quot;I mean, I do, have a reputation and all.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care about that.&quot; She shrugged.

&quot;As you&#39;ve said.&quot;

&quot;Yup.&quot;

A waiter approached them. Celest recognized the youth; he graduated from 
the same class she did.

&quot;Evening folks, what can I do for you tonight?&quot; He asked, not giving any 
sign that he recognized her.

&quot;I&#39;ll take the special.&quot; Seifer pointed, holding up his menu. Celest 
didn&#39;t bother looking at hers. &quot;I&#39;ll have the same.&quot; She muttered 
quietly.

&quot;This is going to be interesting.&quot; Seifer mumbled.

&quot;Sorry, I&#39;ve just got some things on my mind.&quot;

&quot;Of course, want to talk about it?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d rather not.&quot;

&quot;Alright then.&quot;

&quot;I just don&#39;t get it.&quot; She sighed, causing Seifer to regard her 
curiously. &quot;I mean, I think I&#39;m likeable.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t I?&quot;

&quot;Yes...?&quot; Seifer tried.

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome?&quot; He said, unsure of what she was going on about. 
Whatever it was, she seemed to brighten with his answer and a smile 
stretched across her face as the waiter approached them.

****************************

Three figures sat in quiet conversation in the front Lobby of Balamb&#39;s 
sickbay. Raijin had insisted on reminiscing for awhile much to Fujin&#39;s 
chagrin. Jaya sat silently listening to his tales, some of which she had 
heard countless times before. Fujin too, remained mostly silent, content 
to listen to his rambling. Finishing his present tale, Raijin grinned 
hugely and reached into large backpack he brought with him. Jaya looked 
on with interest as he retrieved an old tattered photo album.

&quot;WHERE RETRIEVE?&quot; Fujin snarled as he opened the book across his knees, 
revealing a multitude of small photos.

&quot;I found it this afternoon with some of my stuff in storage.&quot; Raijin 
grinned.

&quot;NEGATIVE!&quot; Fujin all but screeched, reaching for the book.

Raijin hopped up and held the book high over his head, well out of reach 
of Fujin&#39;s grasp.

&quot;Hey now, mom left this to me to take care of.&quot;

&quot;DO NOT DARE!&quot; Fujin frowned; dreading the myriad of potentially 
embarrassing photos that accursed book could produce.

Still holding the book out of reach as his sister jumped in vain, Raijin 
slipped a picture from the book and grinned.

&quot;Aww look at that, duckies!&quot; He chuckled, showing a photo of himself 
being chased by an overprotective waterfowl. Jaya giggled merrily as he 
dug around some more, all the while ignoring Fujin&#39;s protests.

&quot;Oh hey, look at this Fu. It&#39;s when you were first potty trained. It&#39;s 
cute ya know!&quot; He laughed loudly.

&quot;DEVIL!&quot; Fujin hissed.

&quot;I&#39;m joking, I&#39;m joking.&quot;

&quot;You are close?&quot; Jaya asked smilingly.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin snorted.

&quot;Of course!&quot; Raijin added, throwing an obnoxious arm around her.

&quot;As am my brother and I.&quot; Jaya nodded knowingly.

&quot;BROTHER?&quot; Fujin asked.

&quot;Oh yeah, Miguel, you haven&#39;t met him yet. Xu was showing him around 
last time I seen him.&quot; Raijin explained.

&quot;Quastus...?&quot; Jaya mouthed awkwardly, changing the subject, causing 
Fujin to frown slightly.

&quot;Quistis.&quot; Raijin corrected her. &quot;What about her?&quot;

&quot;People have mentioned, who is she?&quot;

&quot;Oh um...well.&quot; Raijin stammered. &quot;It&#39;s kinda complicated ya know.&quot;

&quot;A Lover?&quot; Jaya inquired innocently.

Fujin made a funny noise at the comment earning a confused look from the 
woman.

&quot;Who, me, no way.&quot; Raijin babbled.

&quot;MINE.&quot; Fujin said firmly, seeing no reason to dance around the subject.

Jaya looked startled a moment and Fujin waited to see if she&#39;d be forced 
to kick the woman out. Raijin grinned stupidly, hoping for the best.

&quot;Ah.&quot; Jaya finally nodded. &quot;Sorry for you&#39;re loss.&quot;

&quot;NOT LOST YET.&quot; Fujin said darkly and used to opportunity to snag the 
photo album from Raijin. &quot;IS LATE.&quot; She said, glancing through the book 
idly for a second.

&quot;Um yeah, I guess it&#39;s time we head out ya know.&quot;

&quot;ROOM?&quot;

&quot;Huh, oh yeah, Xu hooked us up ya know.&quot;

&quot;Nice meeting you.&quot; Jaya smiled, moving to kiss Fujin once more. Fujin 
backed up with a scowl, causing the woman to giggle awkwardly. &quot;So 
silly, I apologize.&quot;

&quot;Hey now, back off she&#39;s mine ya know.&quot; Raijin chuckled, throwing an arm 
around Jaya.

&quot;IDIOT.&quot; Fujin huffed, rolling her eye as she walked them out.

After they where gone she locked up and turned to head back to Quistis. 
Turning around she nearly shouted in shock as Aeka stood staring at her. 
Fujin blinked and tensed, expecting anything from the apparition. Little 
surprise though, that by time she looked again, it had gone.

********************

It was late, and the resultant had all but kicked Seifer and Celest out. 
Which was a good thing, considering both had far too much to drink. 
Seifer however, had the constitution of a tyrannosaur and showed very 
little signs of being inebriated. Celest was another matter entirely. 
Luckily though, Seifer had kindly removed her high-heels so she wouldn&#39;t 
break her neck as she staggered up the hall laughing giddily. The 
evening had been a quiet one for the most part, until the drinking 
started. From that point forward Seifer just sat back, content to hear 
her ramble on and on about whatever came into her alcohol clouded mind, 
which, to his amusement was a wide assortment of lewd jokes and sea 
chanteys. Shaking his head and grinning to himself, he had to admit that 
it had been a long time since he&#39;d enjoyed himself so much. It was 
almost like the old days, when girls would all but throw themselves at 
him.

As they arrived at her apartment, Celest turned to face him. Leaning 
forward with a woozy grin, she all but spilled out of her dress.

&quot;Here we are.&quot; She giggled.

&quot;So it seems.&quot; Seifer chuckled, not taking his eyes off her.

&quot;You coming in?&quot;

&quot;Is that a trick question?&quot; He said with a smile.

&quot;You know what I mean.&quot; She purred, throwing her arms over his broad 
shoulders.

&quot;Do I?&quot; He countered cagily.

&quot;I think so.&quot; She chuckled, then moved to kiss him.

&quot;I don&#39;t think that would be such a good idea.&quot; He said, still grinning 
as he gently held her at bay.

&quot;Why not?&quot; She breathed, taking his hands and planting them firmly 
against her breasts. Seifer&#39;s grin faded slightly at the overt 
implications. &quot;Tell me you want me.&quot; She whispered huskily, gazing up at 
him.

&quot;You&#39;re drunk.&quot; He mumbled.

&quot;So are you, what&#39;s the point.&quot;

&quot;I thought you said your saving yourself for marriage.&quot; He said warily.

&quot;Like you give a shit.&quot; She scowled, as she ran her hands hungrily over 
his chest.

&quot;I don&#39;t, to be honest.&quot; He shrugged as her hands dipped dangerously 
lower. &quot;But you do.&quot; He added, then pushed her away roughly.

&quot;What the hell!&quot; She shouted, falling against the door.

&quot;Look at you.&quot; Seifer snorted.

&quot;What...&quot; Celest mumbled awkwardly, adjusting her dress.

&quot;I guess folks were right about you.&quot; He frowned.

&quot;Shut up.&quot; She frowned.

&quot;What was it you said they called you. Tramp, easy, slut?&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; She shouted.

&quot;Well, were they right?&quot;

&quot;Fuck you!&quot;

&quot;Oh, now you&#39;re offended.&quot; He scoffed then roughly grabbed her by the 
shoulders and pinned her against the door.

&quot;Let me go!&quot; She snarled as he kissed her roughly along the neck.

&quot;This is what you wanted right?&quot; He breathed harshly, pressing himself 
closer.

&quot;No...&quot; She whimpered trying to push him away, but to no avail. He 
paused and stared at her, his eyes cold and emotionless.

&quot;No...&quot; She whispered again.

&quot;Good.&quot; He huffed; letting her loose and she promptly slid to the floor 
in tears. &quot;Oh get up.&quot; He groaned, hauling her to her feet.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; She murmured.

&quot;You should be.&quot; He spat without any remorse. &quot;Just so you know. It 
wasn&#39;t to long ago that I would&#39;ve took you up on your offer.&quot;

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you...?&quot; She whispered; her cheeks streaked with mascara 
stained tears.

&quot;Because I&#39;m no longer that person. Rest assured though, I&#39;m still a 
bastard, just remember that when you think you know me.&quot;

&quot;I just wanted...&quot;

&quot;I know what you wanted, I knew it from the first time I met you. You&#39;re 
looking for your prince, some white knight to come sweep you off your 
feet. It&#39;s a pipe dream lady and I think you just realized that, so you 
threw yourself at the first slob you came across, me!&quot; He scowled then 
turned to leave.

&quot;I...&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot; He shouted, turning back on her.

&quot;I...&quot;

&quot;Speak up!&quot; He sneered.

Celest grew quiet and stared at him in a confused stupor. Throwing his 
hands, in the air he gazed at her with contempt.

&quot;Grow the fuck up, I don&#39;t have time for games.&quot; He said venomously then 
stormed off, leaving her wallowing in self-pity.

*********************

Fujin stepped out of the shower and dried her hair briskly. She was 
tired; it had been a long and emotionally draining day. She slipped on a 
long comfy nightshirt and padded barefoot across the cold tile floor 
towards Quistis. Making a mental note to get some throw rugs, she fixed 
a cup of hot cocoa then sat down on the modest loveseat the doubled as 
her bed. Quietly, she switched off the small lamp nearby and looked out 
the window. The moon hung large in the sky, bathing the room with a blue 
glow. She had pushed the troubling vision of Aeka out of her mind as she 
quietly finished her drink. Sighing softly, she gazed at Quistis with 
sad longing.

&quot;Miss You...&quot; She mumbled, her voice barely audible as she unfolded the 
heavy blanket that sat beside her. Curling up, she got comfortable and 
was soon well on her way to blissful sleep. A loud knocking stopped her 
journey and she sat up with a growl. Rising to her feet she started 
towards the door and stubbed her toe.

&quot;DAMN!&quot; She cursed loudly as she left the room and entered the lobby of 
the clinic. Peeking out the blinds she saw Celest. The young woman was 
distraught looking, and dressed as if she were on some sleazy late night 
show about vacationing teenagers.

&quot;GO AWAY.&quot; Fujin growled.

&quot;I need to talk to you.&quot; Celest cried, her makeup was a mess and had 
formed dark halos around her eyes making her look like a drunken 
raccoon.

&quot;Please, I need to talk to someone...&quot;

&quot;DRUNK, DEPART.&quot; Fujin huffed, then shut the blind. She prepared to go 
back to her room when something made her pause. With a sigh, she ran a 
hand through her hair and set her jaw. Turning around in annoyance, she 
went to the front door and opened it.

Stepping out into the hallway, she saw Celest stagger away sullenly. The 
girl looked like crap.

&quot;HOLD.&quot; Fujin called half-heartedly before going after her. Celest 
turned to face her with zombie-like enthusiasm.

&quot;Sorry...&quot; She mumbled as Fujin threw a supportive arm around her and 
led her back to the clinic.

&quot;LOOK BAD.&quot; Fujin noted as they entered the waiting room.

&quot;I&#39;ve ruined everything.&quot; Celest groaned as Fujin sat her on one of the 
couches. Fujin didn&#39;t ask, assuming she&#39;d find out anyway. Instead, she 
went to her room and fixed more cocoa, one for her and one for her 
guest.

&quot;I&#39;m stupid...&quot; Celest called to her.

Sarcasm tickled Fujin&#39;s throat but she remained silent, sensing 
something was seriously wrong.

&quot;Seifer was right...&quot; Celest continued. Fujin twitched and nearly 
dropped the cups she was carrying. Somehow, she knew he was involved, he 
was always involved. Walking back out, she offered a cup to Celest then 
sat down opposite her.

&quot;I made a damn fool out of myself.&quot; Celest sighed, sipping her drink 
meekly.

Fujin didn&#39;t answer but quietly listened.

&quot;I threw myself at him... It was horrible...&quot;

&quot;DID YOU...?&quot; Fujin asked, growing very somber.

&quot;No... but I would have... he stopped me...&quot;

&quot;JOKING?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;WHY?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t know anything...&quot;

Fujin sipped her drink again then sighed.

&quot;WHAT THINKING?&quot;

&quot;I was drunk?&quot; Celest frowned, but the excuse sounded hollow even to 
her.

&quot;WHAT NOW?&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;m going to leave...&quot;

&quot;FOOLISH.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t face everyone...they&#39;d be so disappointed in me.&quot;

&quot;NOTHING HAPPENED.&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;

&quot;NO ONE KNOWS.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d know and so would you.&quot;

&quot;AGAIN, NOTHING HAPPENED.&quot;

&quot;Damn it, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do.&quot; Celest groaned. Still in a 
drunken stupor, she fumbled her cup slightly. Overeating in her attempt 
to steady it, she instead sent it tumbling end over end and spilled its 
contents on her lap. With a shrill yelp, she jumped up fanning herself.

&quot;Damn it, damn it damn it!&quot; She cried in frustration.

Fujin watched her dully with a growing sense of sympathy.

&quot;CELEST.&quot; She said calmly, getting the frazzled young woman&#39;s attention.

&quot;What...&quot; She sniffed pathetically.

&quot;NEED TO SLEEP.&quot;

&quot;How can I... I&#39;m horrible.&quot;

&quot;THINK CLEARER.&quot;

&quot;Easy for you to say.&quot; Celest frowned then collapsed back into her chair 
unconscious.

Fujin stared in befuddlement a moment before rising to check on her. 
After a brief inspection she was satisfied that she was okay and had 
only passed out. Shaking her head in disappointment, she laid Celest out 
on the couch then retrieved a spare blanket from one of the other rooms. 
After throwing the blanket over her houseguest, she cleaned up the mess 
and put the dishes back where they belonged. Then, with a silent prayer 
for peace and quiet, she switched off the lights and went back to bed.

**************************

Doctor Kadowaki yawned sleepily as she unlocked the front door to her 
office. Walking in, she sat her workbook on the counter and turned on 
the lights. A groan issued forth from one of the couches and she turned 
in surprise as Celest sat up looking like a strung out hooker.

&quot;Oh dear me.&quot; Kadowaki mumbled.

&quot;Where am I?&quot; Celest groaned, holding her head.

&quot;My office, are you okay dear?&quot; The doctor frowned, moving to check on 
her.

&quot;Yeah I guess...what time is it?&quot;

&quot;Eight.&quot;

&quot;Oh...I feel terrible...&quot;

&quot;If I may say so, you look it. How&#39;d you get in here?&quot;

&quot;Umm, Fujin I think.&quot;

&quot;I see, well unless you need medical assistance I&#39;m going to have to ask 
you to leave. I can&#39;t have people sleeping off hangovers in my waiting 
room.&quot;

Celest blushed and hurriedly folded the blanket and looked around in 
vain for her shoes.

&quot;Um, of course.&quot; She muttered as she gave up the search and rushed out 
the door. Kadowaki frowned as she left then headed to Quistis&#39; room. 
Knocking briskly, she intended to have a few words with Fujin.

The door opened fairly quickly, Fujin was obviously already awake.

&quot;Am I interrupting.&quot;

&quot;QUISTIS SPONGE BATH.&quot; Fujin answered warily, sensing that the Doctor 
was upset about something.

&quot;I&#39;m sure you know why I&#39;m here.&quot;

&quot;CELEST.&quot;

&quot;Yes. I&#39;m not happy.&quot;

&quot;APOLOGY.&quot;

&quot;I let you stay here out of respect for Miss Trepe. I don&#39;t appreciate 
you letting your little friends hang out after hours.&quot;

Fujin was above making excuses, she knew she was wrong for letting 
Celest stay and was prepared to accept the consequences.

&quot;WILL VACATE.&quot; She said, barely hiding her disappointment.

Kadowaki folded her arms and studied her.

&quot;No need for that.&quot; She said after a moment of deliberation.

&quot;NEVER AGAIN.&quot;

&quot;I sure it won&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;THANK YOU.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t thank me yet. You&#39;re not getting off that easy.&quot; Kadowaki said 
with a stern grin.

&quot;UNDERSTAND.&quot;

&quot;I need a nurse.&quot; Kadowaki said simply. Fujin&#39;s eye bulged in its 
socket.

&quot;We&#39;ll start you&#39;re training immediately after you finish bathing your 
patient.&quot;

The older woman explained, giving no hint of humor or jest.

&quot;NURSE!?&quot; Fujin stammered.

&quot;Yes, it&#39;s good training and will teach you better responsibility.&quot;

Fujin started to protest but considered the potential alternative.

&quot;FINE.&quot; She sighed.

&quot;Relax.&quot; Kadowaki grinned. &quot;Quistis will need a lot of help when she 
wakes up, you&#39;ll be glad you did it.&quot; She said optimistically. &quot;Besides, 
look at all you&#39;ve learned already. Monitoring her condition, giving her 
shots, changing her the IV, I could go on, but you get the point. It&#39;ll 
do you good, that and we can work on your people skills.&quot;

&quot;PEOPLE SKILLS...&quot; Fujin frowned. &quot;ARE FINE.&quot;

&quot;Please...&quot; Kadowaki scoffed. &quot;Anyway, I&#39;ve got to get ready for our 
first patients.&quot; She said, pausing before leaving. &quot;Oh, and you can find 
uniforms in the closet by the supply room.

&quot;UNIFORM!?&quot; Fujin balked. &quot;BUT...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be late.&quot; Kadowaki winked, leaving her to her misery.

***************************

Having arrived in Timber late in the evening Zell decided to stay the 
night instead of flying back half-asleep. It was mid morning when he 
finally returned to Balamb and he decided to eat before heading home. 
Sitting down cheerfully, he was prepared to gorge on his daily ration of 
hotdogs when a massive hand closed around his face and another lifter 
him clean out of his chair. Kicking wildly he was about to panic that 
he&#39;d walked into an ambush when a bellowing laugh blasted into his ear.

Raijin sat him on the ground and clapped him hard on the shoulder in a 
manner better suited for adrenaline pumped football players. Zell just 
looked at him with a confused mix of emotions.

&quot;Long time no see ya know!&quot; The larger man shouted.

&quot;Where the hell did you come from!&quot; Zell blurted, backing up in shock.

&quot;Aw what kinda way is that to greet a friend ya know. Here, I&#39;d like to 
introduce you to my pals.&quot; Raijin laughed, gesturing to a tall older man 
to his left and a tall leggy woman on his right.

&quot;This is Miguel and Jaya. They&#39;re like family ya know!&quot;

&quot;Fine, fine. Hello.&quot; Zell nodded in aggravation then waved his hand in 
front of Raijin&#39;s grinning mug in hopes of getting him to focus. &quot;Now, 
I&#39;ll ask again, where the hell did you come from?&quot;

&quot;Morning folks!&quot; Xu waved as she and Nida walked over with their trays.

&quot;This the, charmer, you told me about.&quot; Nida said jokingly, gesturing to 
Miguel.

&quot;Yup he&#39;s the one.&quot; Xu smirked.

&quot;My dear.&quot; Miguel blushed slightly. &quot;You did not tell me you where, 
aquatinted with a gentleman.&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot; Zell blinked, even more confused.

&quot;Oh, you mean him?&quot; Xu chuckled, hugging Nida&#39;s arm. &quot;Ignore him, tell 
me how beautiful I am again.&quot; She smirked.

&quot;Okay now, that&#146;s enough.&quot; Nida said, souring slightly, but still in 
good humor.

&quot;My apologies.&quot; Miguel bowed slightly, his rugged features gleaming with 
a youthful mischief that seemed charmingly out of place for a man his 
age.

&quot;Who&#39;s this guy, your father?&quot; Zell asked, curiously, earning a glare 
from the man.

&quot;He&#39;s a friend of mine.&quot; Raijin laughed.

&quot;And you are?&quot; Miguel asked, eyeing the younger man questioningly.

&quot;I&#39;m Zell.&quot;

&quot;Greetings.&quot;

&quot;They came to check on Fujin.&quot; Xu explained, sensing that Zell&#39;s slight 
confusion.

&quot;Oh that&#146;s good, I bet she&#39;s glad to see you. It&#39;s been a trying time 
for her.&quot; Zell smiled at Raijin as everyone sat down.

&quot;I think she is. But it&#39;s hard to tell. I mean, its Fu ya know.&quot; Raijin 
grinned.

&quot;Zell!&quot; Nicole shouted from the far side of the cafeteria, getting 
everyone&#39;s attention. Grabbing a tray, she hurried over and grabbed him 
in a hug.

&quot;When did you get back!&quot; She beamed, squeezing in between him and Xu.

&quot;Not too long ago. I went ahead and stayed the night.&quot;

&quot;I missed you!&quot; She cooed, as they nuzzled nose to nose while mumbling a 
slew of sickeningly sweet pet names.

&quot;Gah, you two, get a room!&quot; Xu huffed.

*******************

Ellone entered the clinic with a sense of uneasiness. Something worried 
her, something unexplainable. She couldn&#39;t be sure of what it was, but 
she had learned long ago, to follow pay heed to her hunches. The main 
problem though, was that she had no idea what to do about it. She knew 
that journeying into Quistis&#39; ruined psyche was dangerous for all 
involved, but it had to be done. Although Fujin and Kadowaki did their 
best to keep Quistis stable, the fact remained that she was 
deteriorating a bit each day and at an increasing rate. Doctor Kadowaki 
looked up from her computer with look of concern.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Ellone asked.

&quot;I&#39;m worried that you two are in over your heads.&quot; She older woman said 
bluntly.

&quot;I know we are.&quot; Ellone sighed.

&quot;I have to look out for the welfare of all three of you, you know that.&quot;

&quot;I do.&quot;

&quot;Then I hope you&#39;ll understand when I have to put a stop to all of 
this...&quot;

&quot;I will... Fujin though...&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll do the right thing.&quot;

&quot;Where is she now?&quot;

&quot;Oh, well that&#146;s an interesting story.&quot; Kadowaki smiled wolfishly as 
Fujin walked out of adjacent room. She was dressed in simple green 
scrubs and white coat, with her hair pinned up neatly. Her peculiar 
looks and militaristic manner made her appear more like the crony of 
some mad doctor than a nurse.

&quot;That&#146;s just...wrong.&quot; Ellone mouthed.

&quot;SILENCE.&quot; Fujin huffed, folding her arms.

&quot;Why...?&quot; Ellone asked, staring in confusion at Doctor Kadowaki.

&quot;I need the help, she needs the training, and she&#39;s being punished.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Ellone nodded.

&quot;WELL?&quot; Fujin asked grumpily, looking to Kadowaki.

&quot;We&#39;re done for now. Don&#39;t forget to read those journals.&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Then shall we get started.&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot; Fujin stated again, motioning to Quistis&#39; room.

Fujin went into the bathroom to change clothes while Ellone set up their 
chairs.

&quot;So, I bet you&#39;re glad to have you&#39;re brother home.&quot;

&quot;VISITING ONLY.&quot;

&quot;Still, must be nice.&quot;

&quot;WORRISOME.&quot;

&quot;You two must be close. I can tell.&quot;

&quot;IMBECILE.&quot;

&quot;Real close.&quot; Ellone grinned. Fujin poked her head out of the bathroom 
to glare at her.

&quot;Okay, fine, I&#39;ll drop it.&quot;

&quot;READY?&quot; Fujin asked as she walked out and took a seat by Quistis&#39; bed.

&quot;Yes.&quot;

They both took one of Quistis&#39; hands in theirs and closed their eyes. 
Ellone let herself drift. She had gotten lots of practice joining their 
minds and didn&#39;t take long for her transport them to the familiar 
ethereal landscape of Quistis&#39; mind.

***********************

&quot;I could die...&quot; Celest groaned.

&quot;If I can be so bold, you look like crap warmed over.&quot; Xu chuckled, 
handing her a cup of coffee.

&quot;Thanks for seeing me.&quot; Celest sighed.

&quot;Well it&#39;s part of the job description.&quot;

&quot;Gee thanks.&quot;

&quot;Joking, joking, calm down. Wow, you really are upset.&quot;

&quot;I made a fool out of myself.&quot;

&quot;And.&quot; Xu grinned.

&quot;Please, don&#39;t I&#39;m not in the mood.&quot; Celest sighed.

&quot;Sorry, okay, I&#39;m serious. What happened?&quot;

&quot;I got drunk...&quot;

&quot;Yeah I think I remember you saying you had a date, how did it go?&quot;

&quot;Horrible.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;I was out with Seifer and...&quot;

&quot;WHAT!?&quot;

&quot;Seifer.&quot;

&quot;I heard that. You went on a date!?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;What the hell where you thinking?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;She doesn&#39;t know.&quot; Xu said in exasperation. Then a look of sheer horror 
crossed her face. &quot;Oh hyne...what happened, you two didn&#39;t...?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;Thank goodness.&quot; Xu sighed in relief.

&quot;I wanted to though...&quot; Celest added in embarrassment. &quot;I kinda threw 
myself at him.&quot;

&quot;Oh, oh, oh! I am so not hearing this!&quot; Xu, blurted, jumping up and 
covering her ears.

&quot;Xu, you said, you&#39;d listen darn it.&quot; Celest whined.

&quot;La, la, la, la! I know you didn&#39;t throw yourself at Seifer, I refuse to 
believe it! It was a drunken hallucination. And do you know why I know 
you&#39;re crazy?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;Because the man is an animal, an insatiable machine that uses women 
like toilet paper then throws them away when he&#39;s done. So you see, if 
you threw yourself at him, then you two must have...ugh...&quot;

&quot;He turned me down.&quot;

&quot;You made that up.&quot; Xu snapped angrily.

&quot;No I didn&#39;t&quot; Celest sulked.

&quot;Yes you did! I don&#39;t believe it, why the hell would he turn you down. 
Assuming of course you&#39;re telling the truth.&quot;

&quot;I am... he was actually kind of sweet about it...&quot;

&quot;Sweet...?&quot;

&quot;Well, yeah...sorta.&quot;

&quot;Sorta?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Xu repeated, growing ever more skeptical.

Celest gave a lost smile and shrugged.

&quot;Okay...&quot; Xu sighed, sitting down. &quot;Let me see if I have this straight. 
You.&quot; She said, pointing at the distraught woman by her side. &quot;You two 
went on a date?&quot;

&quot;Yes...&quot;

&quot;And then you got drunk and threw yourself at him?&quot;

&quot;Yah...&quot;

&quot;And he turned you down...?&quot;

&quot;Just like I said, what am I going to do?&quot; Celest cried.

&quot;What are you going to do!?&quot; Xu squawked. &quot;You&#39;re going to thank you&#39;re 
lucky stars he didn&#39;t take advantage of an idiot! I can&#39;t believe this. 
Oh you are so, so lucky Quistis isn&#39;t around to hear this, she&#39;d have a 
damn cow.&quot;

Celest was ignoring her, caught up in her own thoughts.

&quot;He was disappointed in me... in a way, it was kinda sweet.&quot; She sighed.

&quot;You&#39;re depraved.&quot; Xu glared.

&quot;No I&#39;m not...&quot; Celest frowned, snapping out of her idle ramblings.

&quot;I beg to differ.&quot;

&quot;I came to you for advice not ridicule.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;m giving it. Stay away from the man, he&#39;s bad news. I don&#39;t care 
if he has turned over a new leaf.&quot;

&quot;I guess you&#39;re right...&quot;

&quot;I know I am.&quot;

&quot;He probably isn&#39;t interested anyway.&quot;

&quot;Oh don&#39;t get all depressed, these things happen, give it time.&quot;

&quot;Easy for you to say.&quot; Celest sighed. &quot;Thanks for the pep talk, I&#39;ll see 
you around.&quot; She grumbled, standing to leave.

&quot;Hey wait a minute.&quot; Xu frowned. &quot;Hang out a little while, Nida&#39;s off 
today. We were gonna watch some movies, you&#39;re welcome to join us.&quot;

&quot;No thanks, see you around.&quot; Celest said with a small smile as she left 
the apartment. Xu&#39;s expression dropped in dismay as the door shut.

&quot;Damn it.&quot; She groaned, rubbing her face in dismay.

*******************

&quot;Hey doc!&quot; Raijin shouted as he strode into the clinic.

&quot;Raijin, please, keep it down.&quot; Kadowaki said with a strained, but 
tolerant smile.

&quot;Sorry Doctor K.&quot;

&quot;What can I do for you?&quot;

&quot;Here to see my sister ya know.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s in a session with Ellone.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah...I kinda heard about that ya know.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Kadowaki sighed, looking towards Fujin and Quistis&#39; room.

&quot;Any hope?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m really not at liberty to discuss that Raijin.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s bologna and you know it, I&#39;m family ya know.&quot;

&quot;To be honest, I don&#39;t know.&quot; Kadowaki frowned. &quot;What they&#39;re doing is 
out of my league. All I know is that Quistis&#39; condition is deteriorating 
despite our best efforts.&quot;

&quot;That blows, Miss Trepe&#39;s a good lady ya know.&quot;

&quot;Yes she is... I must say though, I&#39;m worried about Fujin...&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;I assume you know how...um...close they are?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not completely brain dead ya know.&quot;

&quot;Sorry. Anyway, it&#39;s been my observation, that she&#39;s grown very 
dependent on Quistis.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s in a coma doc.&quot;

&quot;I know, but she&#39;s still alive. If she were to die...&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t think like that ya know. If it happens...&quot; He sighed then 
shrugged sadly. &quot;Then it happens, it&#39;ll suck, we&#39;ll all mourn, but we&#39;ll 
move on.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s very mature of you.&quot; Kadowaki smiled softly.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen a lot in these past few years ya know, I grew up. As for 
Fujin though, I know my sister, she&#39;s strong, she&#39;ll survive.&quot; He said 
proudly.

Kadowaki nodded and glanced once more over to Fujin&#39;s room.

&quot;I just pray it doesn&#39;t come to that.&quot;

&quot;It won&#39;t. From what I hear, Ellone is some kind of prodigy, if she and 
Fu think they can help Miss Trepe, then I believe it too.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll see.&quot; Kadowaki said sadly. &quot;We&#39;ll see.&quot;

*****************************

Gray wastes, howling winds, a desolate nothingness for as far as the 
eyes could see. Ellone winced; somehow, the place seemed to grow more 
dismal every time they visited which was hard to imagine considering the 
emptiness of the place. Fujin walked someway ahead of her, her eyes 
searching for a sign, anything that would help them bring Quistis&#39; 
consciousness back.

Ellone didn&#39;t want to admit it, but she had given up hope. Not that she 
would dare tell Fujin for fear it would break her, and so, she endured, 
and prayed Fujin would accept the reality, that in all likelihood, 
Quistis was gone. With a sign, she moved to catch up with Fujin.

&quot;Anything?&quot; She asked wearily.

&quot;No...&quot; Fujin answered quietly.

&quot;I can&#39;t keep this up much longer Fu, it gets harder by the day, there&#39;s 
just not enough to work with, and it&#39;s getting worse.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re giving up...&quot; Fujin sighed.

&quot;No, I&#39;ll help as long as possible, but if we&#39;re in here and she...&quot; 
Ellone started then trailed off as Fujin cut her a look so foul it 
nearly snapped her back to reality.

&quot;Fujin, I just want you to understand...&quot;

&quot;I do...&quot; Fujin whispered, her features softening. &quot;Can&#39;t force you to 
risk it... I am sorry.&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s okay, I&#39;m willing to take the chance. I just wanted you to 
know the risks involved.

&quot;I can&#39;t ask you to...&quot; Fujin started then trailed off as the sky 
darkened around them.

&quot;Oh no...&quot; Ellone whispered, nearly panicked by the implications.

Screams erupted from the very air around them, some eerily human while 
others where uniquely bestial and all where frightening in there 
intensity.

The ground beneath Fujin&#39;s feet erupted as a large spire of ice burst 
forth causing her to fall. She shimmered slightly as her concentration 
wavered from the shock but she quickly recovered and stood.

&quot;Ellone!&quot; She shouted over the earsplitting howls.

&quot;What should I do?&quot; Ellone asked worriedly as

Aeka appeared before them, gray, and cold in appearance, her eyes, solid 
black, glimmered as if reflecting the stars in a clear evening sky.

&quot;Release...&quot; The Aeka responded, speaking in the strange amalgam of 
Quistis&#39; and her voices that she had before.

Fujin gasped but stayed calm, out of fear of shattering their link 
again. Ellone too, looked worried but kept herself relaxed.

&quot;Aeka...&quot; Fujin whispered.

&quot;Help them...&quot; The girl, said again, her features, bland and 
emotionless.

&quot;Who?&quot; Ellone asked.

&quot;They are frightened, and angry...&quot;

&quot;Where is Quistis?&quot; Fujin asked in a near panic.

&quot;They are frightened...&quot; Aeka whispered.

&quot;Who...?&quot; Ellone asked once more.

&quot;The guardians...&quot;

&quot;Guardians...&quot; Ellone frowned.

&quot;Oh no...&quot; Fujin stammered in horror. As if on cue, the ground beneath 
them rumbled once more and Shiva burst forth with an unwholesome screech 
of anguish and insanity. Normally, Shiva&#39;s appearance was that of a 
beautifully exotic woman with ice blue skin and striking features. Now 
though, her appearance was terrible to behold, gaunt, and gray, like a 
long forgot corpse buried in the snow. Stingy, gray-blue hair whipped 
around her head as eyes clouded with cataracts gleamed with insanity.

Ellone screamed as the guardian lunged forward and grabbed her shoulder. 
Fujin tackled her away even as the two came in contact. Aeka stood 
silent witness as the three of them rolled across the crumbling, ashy 
ground. Ellone screamed in pain. The area where area when the guardian 
touched her had grew as cold tortured in appearance as Shiva&#39;s own 
flesh, spreading down her entire arm.

The attack was too much to bear and Ellone lost control. With a scream 
she exploded into a misty like vapor and vanished from Quistis&#39; 
consciousness.

Fujin looked in confusion as her own form began to dissipate. With a 
desperate glance, she found Aeka. The girl said nothing, her dark eyes 
expressing no hint of emotion. Then all was dark.

Fujin burst back into reality with a spastic jolt that through her to 
the floor. Strong arms caught her and she turned to find Shiva&#39;s 
horrific countenance glaring down at her. The guardian opened her thin 
pale lips and screamed in her face, the sound was akin to a banshee&#39;s 
keening as Fujin&#39;s heart jumped in her chest. With a defiant scream she 
raked her nails down thing&#39;s face and kicked it away.

Doctor Kadowaki fell away screaming in pain from Fujin&#39;s assault even as 
Raijin moved to separate the two.

&quot;FUJIN!&quot; He shouted grabbing her. Fujin jerked and stared wild eyed for 
a moment as her senses cleared.

&quot;RAIJIN!&quot; She stammered. She could hear Ellone and Kadowaki both crying 
one in fright and the other in pain. &quot;HAPPENED!?&quot;

The door to Quistis&#39; room burst opened as Nicole and Zell rushed in.

&quot;I heard a scream!&quot; Zell shouted.

Nicole moved to Kadowaki&#39;s side and gawked in horror. &quot;Hyne, what 
happened!?&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t feel my arm!&quot; Ellone cried. The limb seemed normal in 
appearance but hung limply at her side.

&quot;Everybody needs to calm down ya know!&quot; Raijin shouted.

&quot;APOLOGY!&quot; Fujin cried in dismay upon seeing Kadowaki&#39;s ruined face.

&quot;Hold on Ma&#39;am.&quot; Nicole whimpered. &quot;Zell come here quick!&quot;

&quot;Aw man, aw man, aw man!&quot; Zell rambled wildly as he rushed to help.

He&#39;d taken to keeping one guardian or another junctioned at all times. 
Nicole said he was being paranoid, so she understandably thankful for 
his paranoia as he promptly channeled a spell to heal the Doctor&#39;s 
ravaged face.

After a moment Kadowaki stood wobbly. She promptly moved to Ellone who 
was gingerly beginning to move her arm.

&quot;Okay that&#146;s enough!&quot; She said firmly. &quot;This has gotten too dangerous. I 
must insist you two stop these incursions, they&#39;re making you 
delusional!&quot;

&quot;NOT DELUSION!&quot; Fujin snapped.

&quot;Hey sis, calm down.&quot; Raijin frowned worriedly.

&quot;Someone want to explain what happened here?&quot; Zell spoke up.

&quot;I&#39;d like to know too.&quot; Nicole added quietly.

&quot;Yeah you guys have been in here all day. The doc and me get worried so 
figured we&#39;d come check on you and we you two out like lights. Then the 
next thing we know, you freak out on us?&quot;

&quot;We found something out.&quot; Ellone added pointedly.

&quot;Found what?&quot; Kadowaki asked.

&quot;It&#39;s Quistis&#39; guardian forces...&quot;

&quot;What about em?&quot; Zell asked in confusion.

&quot;TRAPPED.&quot; Fujin frowned, looking worriedly at Quistis.
