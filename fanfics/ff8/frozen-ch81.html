&quot;You&#39;re joking... aren&#39;t you?&quot; Ellone asked, her eyes shadowed eerily in 
the dim room.

&quot;WAS HER.&quot; Fujin assured her, as she caressed Quistis&#39; hand soothingly.

&quot;A lost memory perhaps.&quot; Ellone tried to reason.

&quot;WAS AEKA.&quot;

&quot;Why would she be in Quistis&#39; mind?&quot;

&quot;UNKNOWN.&quot;

&quot;Suppose you&#39;re right? Then what does it mean?&quot;

&quot;YOU&#39;RE EXPERT!?&quot; Fujin gawked.

&quot;I never said that. This is as new to me as it is you.&quot;

&quot;DANGEROUS...&quot;

&quot;I told you that when we started...&quot;

&quot;WHAT TO DO?&quot;

&quot;Calm down for starters.&quot;

&quot;AM CALM.&quot;

&quot;No you&#39;re not, you&#39;re a nervous wreck.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;M FINE.&quot;

&quot;Whatever...&quot;

A knock sounded, causing both women to jump slightly. Doctor Kadowaki 
poked her head in the room.

&quot;You girls okay, you&#39;ve been holed up in here for hours now.&quot;

&quot;HUH?&quot; Fujin frowned, then glanced at her watch. Indeed, well over three 
hours had past since they began the session.

&quot;Strange...&quot; Ellone mouthed.

&quot;Everything okay?&quot; Kadowaki asked again.

&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am we&#39;re fine.&quot; Ellone assured her with a girlish grin.

Kadowaki looked unconvinced but didn&#39;t push the matter.

&quot;Yeah, well let me know if I can help.&quot; She offered before going back to 
her desk. Fujin waited for the door to shut before turning quickly to 
Ellone.

&quot;WHAT HAPPENED?&quot;
&quot;I... I don&#39;t know...&quot; Ellone stammered.

&quot;THREE HOURS!&quot;

&quot;I know...&quot;

&quot;NEVER SO LONG.&quot;

&quot;It usually lasts only a few minutes on the outside...&quot;

&quot;HOW?&quot;

&quot;I...I really don&#39;t know...&quot;

Fujin looked to Quistis once more, her face strained with worry as she 
glanced to the telemetry readouts. All of Quistis&#39; signs were as normal 
as could be expected.

&quot;How&#39;d Quistis handle it?&quot; Ellone asked quietly.

&quot;SEEMS FINE.&quot; Fujin sighed with relief. Whatever happened seemed to have 
no lingering effects. Fujin noticed something moving in the late 
afternoon shadows that hung across the far end of the room. It seemed 
wispy like a dim cloud of dark smoke or even a shadow itself. In the 
blink of an eye it was gone, yet she stared long enough to unnerve 
Ellone, who was already ill at ease.

&quot;What?&quot; She asked, jerking around to look behind her.

&quot;NOTHING.&quot; Fujin mumbled, looking back at her.

&quot;Try again tomorrow?&quot; Ellone asked hurriedly, having a nearly irrational 
need to get out of the room. Fujin nodded and walked her out.

&quot;THANK YOU.&quot; She added, then shut the door behind her. After she was 
gone, Fujin turned and nearly screamed. Aeka stood before her, gray and 
transparent.

&quot;They must leave...&quot; The girl whispered, in the odd mix of Quistis&#39; and 
her voices. Then, as soon as she appeared, she was gone. Fujin gasped 
and slowly scanned the room for more denizens of the otherworld. All was 
calm and quiet, except the slow mechanical breathing of Quistis&#39; 
respirator and the soft beeps of the accompanying equipment.

Fujin wasn&#39;t easily spooked but couldn&#39;t help but shiver slightly.

&quot;HALLUCINATION.&quot; She said aloud, coming to the conclusion that it was 
some aftereffect of her and Ellone&#39;s mind-link.

&quot;EDEA.&quot; She sighed, walking back to sit on the edge of Quistis&#39; bed.

&quot;SHE&#39;D KNOW...&quot; If only she were alive.

******************

Watts, Zone and Zell walked towards the Ragnarok quietly. None of the 
men spoke, since Zone was in such a foul mood. Having no desire to be 
around such a moody group, Nicole opted to stay behind as Zell took them 
home. As they neared the gangplank, Celest came out from around the 
other side of the ship&#39;s front landing strut.

&quot;Now, I must say I am upset.&quot; She pouted, putting a hand on her hips.

&quot;Oh man Celest, now is so, not a good time.&quot; Zell mumbled, slipping past 
her. Watts too, said nothing and quickly followed him up the gangplank.

&quot;It&#39;s okay. You guys aren&#39;t who I&#39;m mad at.&quot; She assured them snootily, 
then walked over to Zone who stood staring awkwardly as she sashayed 
towards him.

&quot;So, you&#39;re just heading out eh.&quot; She asked snidely. Being Irvine&#39;s 
sister Celest was tall, even taller than Quistis and had a half-foot on 
Zone who felt suddenly put upon.

&quot;Uh...&quot; He said nervously.

&quot;No good bye or nothin?&quot; She scowled. Zone couldn&#39;t respond and merely 
babbled incoherently. Celest shook her head with a sigh.

&quot;Look, I know you&#39;re an awkward sort. To be honest it&#39;s kind of cute.&quot; 
She smiled. Again, Zone gibbered.

&quot;Okay.&quot; Celest frowned and walked towards him. &quot;Don&#39;t think I didn&#39;t 
notice how you acted when Seifer came a callin.&quot;

&quot;Huh...?&quot; He mumbled, squirming awkwardly under her gaze.

From under the cover of the Ragnarok&#39;s cargo, bay Zell and Watts waited 
quietly, eavesdropping.

&quot;Oh dude we gotta help him, he&#39;s sooo gonna screw the pooch.&quot; Zell 
whispered to as they watched Celest turn up the pressure him.

&quot;I&#39;m not going to lie to you hon.&quot; She said thoughtfully. &quot;He&#39;s 
intriguing to be certain, but I gotta say you&#39;re cute too in your own 
way. So then, what&#39;s a girl to do?&quot;

&quot;Cute?&quot; Zell mouthed skeptically, earning an elbow from Watts. Zone 
stood slack jawed and speechless. His mind screamed at him to say 
something, anything but his mouth just stood agape. Celest soured 
slightly at his silence and folded her arms.

&quot;Look sugar, I&#39;ll make it easy on you. Do you like me or not?&quot; She asked 
flatly, even though she knew the answer.

&quot;What!?&quot; Zone sputtered, taking a few steps backward. Celest moved with 
him until he backed into a stack of cargo crates.

&quot;It&#39;s a simple question.&quot; She said sternly, having no desire to play 
games.

&quot;I...uh.&quot;

&quot;Yes or no.&quot;

&quot;I...well.&quot;

&quot;No?&quot;

&quot;Wait....&quot; He stammered. Zell cringed in horror.

&quot;Oh dude, he&#39;s toast!&quot;

&quot;So it would seem...&quot; Watts nodded.

&quot;It&#39;s not fair, she ambushed him.&quot; Zell growled.

&quot;Wait for what Zone?&quot; She persisted; pressing closer to him until he 
nearly fainted.

&quot;I mean, I guess...&quot; He offered weakly.

&quot;You...guess...&quot; Celest mouthed, her expression growing cold.

&quot;As a friend...?&quot; He mumbled, hoping that was the answer she was looking 
for. It wasn&#39;t, and she rolled her eyes then walked away without another 
word.

&quot;Ugh....&quot; Zell sighed, banging his head on the wall.

&quot;Must unfortunate...&quot; Watts frowned in disappointment.

&quot;Hey...&quot; Zone called to her as she walked away.

&quot;Have a safe trip.&quot; She called back gruffly.

Zone stood a moment; his jaw set in anger as he tried to comprehend what 
just occurred.

&quot;Damn it!&quot; He finally exploded, kicking his duffel bag and throwing an 
all out fit. Zell and Watts watched him from the shadows and exchanged 
glances as his tantrum further erupted into a series of self-scathing 
obscenities.

************************

&quot;Thanks for letting me sit with you. I was kind of lonely with everyone 
gone.&quot; Nicole said quietly as Fujin brushed Quistis&#39; hair.

&quot;NON TROUBLESOME.&quot; Fujin said simply.

&quot;Thanks, I think.&quot; Nicole grinned. &quot;How did it go with Ellone?&quot;

Fujin twitched, she had hoped to put the memory of the disturbing vision 
behind her until later.

&quot;INTERESTING.&quot; She answered mechanically.

&quot;Any luck?&quot; Nicole continued prodding hopefully.

Fujin shook her head solemnly then paused, remembering that she was 
trying to be more social.

&quot;SAW SOMETHING.&quot;

&quot;Oh, what?&quot;

&quot;AEKA....&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot; Where?&quot;

&quot;DURING LINK.&quot;

&quot;Link...you mean in Quisty&#39;s head?&quot; Nicole blinked. She still didn&#39;t 
fully understand what Ellone was attempting. Fujin nodded then looked to 
where she saw Aeka&#39;s apparition by the door.

&quot;THERE TOO.&quot; She pointed, which was just a few feet from where Nicole 
sat. Nicole, shifted nervously for a second then settled.

&quot;Um...you mean you saw a ghost...?&quot;

&quot;THINK VISION.&quot;

&quot;You mean a hallucination?&quot;

Again, Fujin nodded. Nicole pursed her lips in thought then regarded 
Fujin like someone trying not to offend.

&quot;Um Fu...&quot;

&quot;FUJIN.&quot; She grumbled.

&quot;Sorry, Fujin.&quot; Nicole blushed. &quot;Now then...um...&quot; She paused, not sure 
how to continue. &quot;You two aren&#39;t like, taking drugs or smoking anything 
to help this um...linking...are you?&quot;

Fujin didn&#39;t even dignify the question with a response, settling instead 
on a look of annoyance.

&quot;Yeah, um okay.&quot; Nicole grinned sheepishly. &quot;What did Ellone say about 
it?&quot;

&quot;UNKNOWN.&quot;

&quot;That can&#39;t be good. You two need to be careful. Are you sure you guys 
know what you&#39;re doing?&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot; Fujin answered, bending the truth slightly.

&quot;Perhaps you should get Rinoa to help. With her being a sorceress and 
all, perhaps she could help.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin answered quickly. It had taken Ellone long enough to 
learn how to establish a link. Someone with as much uncontrolled 
potential as Rinoa wreak untold havoc if something went wrong.

&quot;But she might be able.&quot;

&quot;NO.&quot;

&quot;Fine, I was just saying...&quot;

&quot;DANGEROUS.&quot;

&quot;Oh...&quot;

&quot;I bet Edea could do something if she were still alive.&quot;

&quot;PERHAPS...&quot; Fujin sighed, not wishing to think about it.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll drop it.&quot;

For that, Fujin was thankful. Setting the brush aside she stood up and 
went to the small refrigerator she had installed a few days prior.

&quot;BEVERAGE?&quot;

&quot;Yes please.&quot; Nicole giggled in response, prompting a scathing look from 
her hostess.

&quot;HUMOROUS?&quot;

&quot;Nothing, really. It&#39;s just that you&#39;re so proper.&quot;

&quot;THEN LEAVE.&quot; Fujin scowled.

&quot;No, no, I mean, it&#39;s funny.&quot;

&quot;FUNNY...&quot; Fujin grumbled, her scowl darkening.

Nicole winced and backpedaled.

&quot;Cute, I mean, it&#39;s cute.&quot;

Fujin was all but steaming now.

&quot;It&#39;s just. Try not to be so proper. Loosen up, ya know?&quot;

&quot;LIKE BROTHER.&quot;

&quot;Gee thanks.&quot; Droned.

&quot;WELCOME.&quot; Fujin responded dryly, handing her a soft drink.

&quot;Like...&quot; Nicole continued thoughtfully. &quot;Instead of beverage, try.. 
cola, or soda pop, or soft drink.&quot;

&quot;NOT ALL... POP.&quot; Fujin explained.

&quot;What?&quot; Nicole giggled causing Fujin to eye her foully. &quot;Oh don&#39;t look 
at me like that, I&#39;m only trying to help.&quot;

&quot;UNNEEDED.&quot;

&quot;Ugh... so difficult.&quot; Nicole growled, growing flustered.

&quot;DOOR THERE.&quot; Fujin shrugged, pointing to the exit.

&quot;No, darn it. I&#39;m just trying to give you some pointers.&quot;

&quot;UNNEEDED.&quot;

&quot;Look, Fujin I&#39;m just trying to give you some variety.&quot;

&quot;UNWANTED.&quot;

&quot;Okay, now you&#39;re just being difficult.&quot;

&quot;DROP SUBJECT.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot;

&quot;GOOD.&quot;

&quot;Good!&quot;

&quot;FINE!&quot;

The two of them started intently at each other over their drinks for a 
long moment, until Nicole finally started to giggle. Startled, Fujin 
stiffened and eyed her weirdly.

&quot;SO FUNNY?&quot;

&quot;Nothing.&quot; Nicole teetered, rubbing her eyes.

&quot;STOP LAUGHING.&quot; Fujin ordered, with a look of indignation that only 
made Nicole giggle even harder

&quot;SIMPLETON.&quot; Fujin grumbled. Nicole&#39;s laughter now consumed her and 
Fujin rolled her eye and sat back down by Quistis, trying to ignore the 
guffawing woman sitting nearby. Nicole showed no sign of abating and 
Fujin couldn&#39;t help but grin at her.

&quot;NOT FUNNY.&quot; She chuckled despite her best efforts.

**********************

The journey back to Timber was a quite affair; no one had spoken of what 
had transpired between Celest and Zone. That is until Zell, unable to 
keep his curiosity in check finally spoke his mind. Putting the ship on 
auto pilot he swung around in his seat.

&quot;Dude, what the hell was that about?&quot;

&quot;Drop it.&quot; Zone growled.

&quot;No way man! That was the weirdest thing I ever seen. What the hell was 
going on between you two?&quot;

&quot;Sir, you have to admit...it seemed you two were having some sort 
of....spat.&quot; Watts piped in.

&quot;Spat, who the hell says spat anymore! Just drop it!&quot; Zone snapped 
irritably, sinking down into his seat.

&quot;No way man, this has got to be talked about.&quot; Zell proclaimed. &quot;Why 
didn&#39;t you tell her you like her? She even made it easy and asked you.&quot;

&quot;Leave me alone.&quot;

&quot;Aw dude, come on, you gotta help me understand dude, it&#39;s driving me 
crazy? Why didn&#39;t you tell her the truth? I mean, what, does she have a 
tail or something weird, why&#39;d ya freeze up.&quot;

&quot;Tail...?&quot; Watts mouthed in confusion, only to be ignored.

&quot;I was stupid okay!&quot; Zone blurted. &quot;It would never work.&quot;

&quot;How could you know that Sir...&quot; Watts frowned.

&quot;I just do. She&#39;s too much...&quot;

&quot;Too much?&quot; Zell wondered aloud. &quot;She&#39;s not fat!?&quot;

&quot;No, no, no.... That&#39;s not what I mean.&quot;

&quot;I think he means he&#39;s threatened by the strength of her personality.&quot; 
Watts translated. Annoyed, Zone looked as if he wanted to slap him.

&quot;What is with you?&quot; He scowled in befuddlement.

&quot;Ah don&#39;t worry about it dude. You&#39;ll get a girl someday.&quot; Zell beamed 
optimistically.&quot;

&quot;Yeah I guess.&quot; Zone mumbled.

&quot;Ah.&quot; Zell smiled knowingly.

&quot;Wait a minute, I&#39;m not a virgin!&quot; Zone screeched, causing Zell to 
nearly have a conniption.

&quot;I never said you were!?&quot; He laughed in shock

&quot;But that&#146;s what you mean!&quot;

&quot;No It wasn&#146;t&#39;. Look dude, it&#39;s non of my business either way, really.&quot; 
Zell said, gesturing for him to calm down.

&quot;Dear me.&quot; Watts mumbled.

&quot;Now look here!&quot; Zone bellowed. &quot;I&#39;ve, I&#39;ve... had lots of women.&quot;

&quot;Dude.&quot; Zell said, just wishing he&#39;d drop it.

&quot;Lots... a horde in fact.&quot;

&quot;Horde.&quot; Watts mumbled in thoughtful horror.

&quot;Dude, okay already. It&#39;s cool, really.&quot; Zell said smoothly.

&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t get mad. I said it was cool.&quot;

&quot;I get girls all the time!&quot;

&quot;Sure thing...&quot; Zell agreed diplomatically then turned his attention 
back on piloting.

&quot;It&#39;s the truth.&quot; Zone groused, falling back into his seat.

***********************

Nida had just settled down to have a coffee break when one of his 
subordinates poked their head into the break room.

&quot;Sir.&quot; You young man said politely.

&quot;Hmm?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s a small shuttle matching our speed and requesting clearance to 
dock.&quot;

&quot;Who is it?&quot;

&quot;Um a Raijin Kazeno&quot;

&quot;Oh hell.&quot;

&quot;Problem sir?&quot;

&quot;No...it was expected. Better let him land before he crashes his way 
into the hanger.&quot;

***************

&quot;FUJIN!&quot; Raijin roared as he jumped from the shuttle before it even 
fully landed. Xu was waiting for him and looked startled as he made a 
beeline straight towards her.

&quot;Whoa Raijin wait a second!&quot; She babbled.

&quot;You guys were supposed to take care of her!&quot; He yelled, charging past 
her.

&quot;Damn it Raijin hold on!&quot; Xu shouted, jumping on his back to try and 
slow him down but. The effort was hopeless and she instead found herself 
an unwilling passenger as he steamed full speed out of the hanger and 
into the inner halls.

&quot;Raijin what the hell are you going on about!?&quot; Xu screamed in his ear 
as he shoved through the throng of people bustling about in the central 
lobby. A couple of well meaning youths decided to help subdue the crazed 
intruder and dog piled on him. They only slowed his momentum and he 
continued his juggernaut like onslaught until he reached the elevator.

&quot;YOU ALL LET HER DIE!&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot; Who!?&quot;

&quot;Where&#39;s Quistis! She promised me ya know!&quot; Raijin shouted in misery.

&quot;Oh Hyne....&quot; Xu gasped. &quot;You don&#39;t know....&quot;

Having been relaxing on the upper balcony, Seifer noticed the commotion 
and hopped down to the lower level. Landing solidly with a grunt he 
waited for Raijin to notice him. His appearance had the desired effect 
and Raijin stopped cold.

&quot;Calm down.&quot; Seifer frowned. What happened next was totally unexpected.

&quot;Son of a bitch!&quot; Raijin roared and punched him squarely in the face.

The blow was something akin to being kicked by a horse and it knocked 
Seifer flat on his ass. Beyond reason now, Raijin tacked him, with Xu 
and several others still in tow.

&quot;So help me! If one more of you assholes lays another hand on me!&quot; 
Seifer shouted angrily as he struggled to keep Raijin at bay.

&quot;DESIST!&quot; Fujin shouted loudly as she and Nicole ran towards the growing 
mob. Nida had saw fit radio ahead about Raijin&#39;s arrival. A good thing, 
since her appearance brought everything to an awkward standstill. With 
the chaos stopped momentarily, everyone turned towards her. Then, 
without warning Raijin exploded yet again, but this time into a joyful 
burst of tears as he charged towards her. Everyone aboard the Raijin 
express abandoned ship as he collided with the hapless Fujin. With an 
ecstatic howl, he grabbed her with bear hug that could&#39;ve killed a man 
twice her size. She took it in stride, knowing resistance was futile.

&quot;Your alive!&quot; He bubbled loudly.

&quot;NOT FOR LONG...&quot; She coughed.

&quot;Sorry...&quot; He squeaked then examined her as if she were a delicate 
porcelain doll. He circled her warily, looking for signs of maiming or 
worse. Finding nothing out of the ordinary, he pulled himself to his 
full height and frowned in confusion.

&quot;I don&#39;t get it...&quot;

&quot;AS ALWAYS.&quot; Fujin mumbled sourly, though she was actually glad to see 
him.

&quot;I tried to tell you.&quot; Xu panted.

&quot;Idiot...&quot; Seifer groaned, sitting up.

&quot;But the letter said you were critically injured ya know?&quot; Raijin 
frowned.

&quot;CRITICALLY.&quot; Fujin sighed in annoyance. &quot;NOT MORTALLY.&quot;

&quot;Idiot.&quot; Seifer proclaimed again.

&quot;Shut up.&quot; Xu sighed, helping him to his feet.

Raijin look thoughtfully a moment then shook his head. &quot;Anyway! What the 
heck happened? I was worried sick ya know! Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s fine.&quot; Nicole offered.

&quot;NORG.&quot; Fujin elaborated.

&quot;What&#39;s a Norg?&quot;

&quot;NORG.&quot; Fujin growled, blowing out her cheeks to make a fat face.

&quot;Oh...that guy.&quot; Raijin nodded in comprehension then scowled viciously. 
&quot;Where is he!?&quot;

&quot;Dead.&quot; Nicole explained.

Raijin promptly grabbed Fujin in another hug, this time however it was 
only less than lethal.

&quot;That&#39;s it! I&#39;m not leaving you again!&quot; He cried.

&quot;Oh for the love of...&quot; Seifer sighed.

&quot;AND YOU!&quot; Raijin shouted, dropping Fujin and spinning around to face 
him. Fujin staggered back and had to be caught by Nicole who just 
watched the drama with a dumbfounded expression.

&quot;CLOD.&quot; Fujin sighed as Raijin verbally blasted Seifer.

&quot;What the hell are you doing here, just leave us alone ya know!&quot; He 
shouted.

&quot;You&#39;re only stirring up stuff, be quiet.&quot; Seifer groaned.

&quot;No, you don&#39;t tell me what to do anymore!&quot;

&quot;Ya, I know.&quot; Seifer grinned and Raijin flinched furiously.

Fujin walked up behind Raijin and put a hand on his shoulder.

&quot;CALM.&quot; She said with an odd gentleness.

&quot;Wha?&quot; Raijin blinked, looking down at her.

&quot;IS OVER.&quot; She said quietly, looking at Seifer.

&quot;It is?&quot; Raijin responded doubtfully, glancing at Seifer.

&quot;Guys, you&#39;re drawing a crowd.&quot; Xu interrupted.

&quot;Oh, um sorry.&quot; Raijin chuckled, rubbing his head in embarrassment as he 
noticed the chaos his rampage caused. His merriment was short lived as 
he finally took in the haggard and drawn expression on Fujin&#39;s face.

&quot;What?&quot; He frowned.

&quot;I&#39;ll fill you in.&quot; Xu said quietly, taking him by the arm.

&quot;Huh?&quot; He started to protest.

&quot;Just come on.&quot;

Finally, the crowd started to disperse and Fujin and Nicole stood with 
Seifer who remained quiet. Fujin took a deep breath and closed her eyes.

&quot;You okay?&quot; Nicole asked worriedly.

Fujin nodded, then turned to head back to Quistis&#39; room.

&quot;I&#39;ll see you later.&quot; Nicole called to her but received no response, 
which she took in stride as she turned to regard Seifer.

&quot;Why do I think I&#39;m the only one who hasn&#39;t hit you?&quot; She asked wryly.

Seifer looked at her blandly then perked up as Celest strode towards 
them.

&quot;What was this ruckus about?&quot; She asked sullenly.

&quot;Fujin&#39;s brother.&quot; Nicole answered.

&quot;Brother? Is he anything like her?&quot;

&quot;Not at all.&quot; Seifer explained then grinned. &quot;How would like to join me 
for dinner?&quot; He asked, out of the blue. Celest look startled and glanced 
to Nicole who shook her head discretely. Looking thoughtful for a 
moment, she decided with a shrug.

&quot;Sure, why not.&quot; She agreed. Though, it was against her better judgment.

&quot;Great, it&#39;s a date.&quot; Seifer smiled, somewhat dashingly before bidding 
them farewell. The moment he was gone, Nicole grabbed Celest by the arm.

&quot;What are you doing!&quot; She hissed in disbelief.

&quot;What&#39;s the harm?&quot; Celest shrugged.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe this. You know he&#39;s bad news.

&quot;You&#39;re the one always saying to give people a chance.&quot;

&quot;Chance yes, dates no. Oh Celest this is so not a good idea.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well.&quot; Celest soured, pulling free of her grasp. &quot;Seems my 
choices are limited. Besides, you&#39;re not my mother.&quot; She snapped then 
stormed off, leaving Nicole standing flabbergasted.</pre>
