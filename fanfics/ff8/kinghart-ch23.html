<p align="center">The  Floodgates Open</p>
<p>Xu lay next to  Quistis, trying to cuddle against her but Quistis was unresponsive  and turned away. The blond curled up in as small a ball as she could  manage and Xu heaved a sigh and sat up.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”  She asked, the covers sliding off her bare body. Quistis said nothing  and remained motionless. “Quistis, come on. This entire hour was  basically you trying to get your mind off something. And you were  failing too because I could see quite clearly that you weren’t  focused on me. It was just empty.” Quistis rolled out of bed and  slipped on a t-shirt.</p>
<p>“You want anything  to drink? Glass of water…?” She asked, putting on a pair of  jeans, the spare that she had left in Xu’s room just in case.</p>
<p>“Stop right where  you are.” Xu ordered. Quistis’s shoulders slumped. “We’re not  going to get very far with this relationship if you don’t tell me  what’s bothering you.” Quistis caved and sat back down on the bed  but she didn’t turn to face Xu.</p>
<p>“You know the four  SeeDs that died today?” She asked.</p>
<p>“Quistis, there was  nothing you could do about it…”<br />
  “It’s not that. One of  them, one of them was Roan. Do you remember him? He graduated with  me.” Xu’s eyes softened.</p>
<p>“Quisty, this is  what it means to be a SeeD. It’s horrible but it’s also likely  that we’re going to lose people we’re close to.” She slid her  hand over Quistis’s and clasped it gently. Quistis shook her head.</p>
<p>“Roan helped me  through…through my difficult time. When I found out that Arik had  gone missing, I was worried. I slipped into depression…”</p>
<p>“I remember.” Xu  replied.</p>
<p>“Xu, it was worse  than you remember. I had all sorts of suicidal thoughts. I nearly  acted upon them, several times. There was just this voice in my head,  deep down that just hated living after he vanished.” She whispered.</p>
<p>“That explains  these.” Xu stated, tracing her finger over the tiny scars on  Quistis’s arms. She smiled sadly.</p>
<p>“Roan actually had  to knock some sense into me. He loaded me with responsibilities; put  more students in my care than any other teacher. At first, I thought  he was cruel and his actions were just stupid. But then I realized  that all those things he made me do, all that extra work and ‘favors’  I did for him, they were actually favors for me. I was so overwhelmed  I literally didn’t have time to think about suicide. He saved me.”  She explained.</p>
<p>“Well I’m grateful  he did.” Xu lifted her hand and kissed it.</p>
<p>“But I couldn’t  save him.” Quistis sighed and her shoulders sagged. Xu kissed her  shoulder, trying to make her feel better but there was a lot weighing  on the Instructor’s mind and Xu remained silent. No need to force  her to talk any more than she had.</p>
<p>“I love you so don’t  you ever think about going away because I’m not going to let you  and you shouldn’t let yourself go either.” Quistis chuckled.</p>
<p>“That made little  sense.” She turned around and embraced Xu. “I love you too. You  better not go anywhere either.” Xu kissed Quistis’s cheek and  smiled. Suddenly, the doorbell rang. The two of them scrambled to get  clothes on and Xu was the one that opened the door.</p>
<p>“Um…is…Quistis  here?” Selphie asked. Xu tried to hid her blush by turning around  and yelling</p>
<p>“Quistis, Selphie’s  here!” Quistis approached the door, slightly ruffled but passable.</p>
<p>“Selphie, it’s the  middle of the night. What are you doing here?” She asked.</p>
<p>“Well, I could ask  you the same thing.” Selphie pouted. “You hang out with Xu a lot  more nowadays.”</p>
<p>“Well…well it’s  because she understands me best. She’s been my friend for who knows  how long. Take Roan for example…she knows how much he meant to me  as a friend.” Quistis rambled. The short brunette pouted.</p>
<p>“You could tell us.”</p>
<p>“Selphie, what are  you here for?” Xu cut the two of them short.</p>
<p>“It’s been bugging  me for a while…and I’ve been losing sleep because of it. I’m  just wondering…what ever happened with Arik. I wanted you to be  happy again so I started looking for him. It just felt like the right  thing to do.” She whispered, looking at her feet. Quistis looked at  her sympathetically and pulled her into a hug.</p>
<p>“Aw, Selphie. It was  the right thing to do. I did love him once and I’m glad to see he’s  well. But people change, Selphie and so do their feelings. He’s not  the same man he once was, and even if he does get his memory back and  turns back into the Arik I once knew, I just…I wouldn’t feel the  same.” She explained. Selphie sniffed a little.</p>
<p>“We only want the  best for you.”</p>
<p>“Come on in.” Xu  said. “We’re looking a little odd standing in the hallway.” The  three of them ushered in and sat down on the couch.</p>
<p>“Selphie, I assure  you, I’m happy as it is. Much happier than I’ve been in a long  time. It’s just something you’ll have to trust me on.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be Xu knows  all about it.” Selphie frowned, casting a glare at Xu. Xu glared  back and Quistis looked nervously at the two.</p>
<p>“It’s really late.  Why don’t you spend the night? We don’t want those Garden staff  hounding you for being out at this hour.” Xu shot Quistis a shocked  look which Selphie saw but disregarded.</p>
<p>“Sure, if that’s  ok with Xu…” She said, smirking at the brunette.</p>
<p>“I don’t…”  Quistis elbowed her sharply in the ribs. “Ok. But you get the  couch.”</p>
<p>“Yay! Slumber  party!” Selphie said excitedly.</p>
<p>“I was hoping we’d  have a repeat session.” Xu muttered under her breath so that  Selphie couldn’t hear. Quistis blushed and hit her on the shoulder.  Selphie eyed the two warily but instead, chose to hug a nearby pillow  with excitement. Xu sighed and shook her head.</p>
<p>“I’m going back to  bed.” She yawned, getting up. Quistis stood to follow but Selphie  grabbed her arm.</p>
<p>“Nope! We’re going  to catch up on things!” The Instructor shot Xu an exasperated look  but Xu had already disappeared into the bedroom.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Quistis quietly snuck  into Xu’s bedroom and slipped under the covers. It was early in the  morning and she suspected that it was about time to get up anyway. Xu  stirred the instant Quistis wrapped her arms around her waist.</p>
<p>“Quistis…?” She  murmured.</p>
<p>“No, it’s  Selphie.” Quistis giggled.</p>
<p>“Hyne forbid.” Xu  replied, yawning and turning to face her. “What time is it?”</p>
<p>“I dunno. 4? 5?”  Xu cuddled closer into Quistis’s arms.</p>
<p>“Missed you last  night. What did you talk about?”</p>
<p>“Nothing important.”  Quistis stroked Xu’s hair.</p>
<p>“What if Selphie  wakes up?” Xu asked and at this, Quistis laughed a little.</p>
<p>“The girl doesn’t  wake any earlier than 7. Trust me. We’ve got time.”</p>
<p>“You have to go back  to work today.” Xu remarked. The Instructor shrugged and gently  leaned into a lazy morning kiss.</p>
<p>“Quisty…?”  Selphie yawned from the doorway. The two jumped and looked at her in  horror. “G’morning.”</p>
<p>“Selphie! You’re  up…early…”</p>
<p>“Thirsty…” She  walked into the bathroom and the two looked at each other, wondering  what they were going to do.</p>
<p>“She didn’t seem  to notice…or maybe she’s just too sleepy?” Quistis offered. Xu  crawled out of bed and started getting changed.</p>
<p>“I have to get up  anyway.” She said.</p>
<p>“Xu…” Quistis  sighed. “They’re my friends. They won’t react badly…”</p>
<p>“What about everyone  else? They’re not all your friends, you know.” Xu replied.  Quistis finally caught on and he wasn’t sure whether to be  frustrated or calm in the situation. She walked in front of Xu, who  was sitting down tying her boots and squatted, looking her in the  eye.</p>
<p>“I am not Becca.”</p>
<p>“I know you’re  not.” Xu replied, looking away, pretending to focus on her laces.</p>
<p>“No. You seem to  have me confused. Both you and Becca were too young to do anything  about your predicament. Xu, I am an adult. Furthermore, I am a SeeD  and an Instructor. No one gets here without being able to defend him  or herself.”</p>
<p>“What if defending  yourself isn’t enough? What if there are too many?”</p>
<p>“I assure you, Xu,  the chances are very unlikely.” Xu seemed to cave. She sighed and  let go of her bootlaces.</p>
<p>“Alright, alright.&quot; Xu replied. Quistis kissed the top of her head.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll let you decide when you feel most comfortable telling them.&quot; At that moment, Selphie stumbled out and headed back  towards the couch. A minute later, they heard an audible thump,  signaling to them that Selphie had gone back to bed.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Zell tackled a Grat  and punched it in the side for a few seconds before the Grat hissed  and fell down limp. Zell barely had time to catch his breath before  another Grat swiped at him. He jumped out of the way as a flurry of  bullets flew past him.</p>
<p>“HEY! That one  nearly hit me!” Zell yelled angrily, shaking a fist at Irvine  before getting smacked by the same Grat in its death throes.</p>
<p>“You’re forgetting  who you’re talking to.” Irvine smirked. “If I wanted to hit  you, I would’ve.” Zell growled.</p>
<p>“Just wait…one of  these days…”</p>
<p>“You seen Selphie  around? We’re supposed to go to dinner tonight but I haven’t seen  or heard her.” Zell smiled.</p>
<p>“A date? Finally!  Jeez, what took you so long?” Irvine sneered at him.</p>
<p>“Hey, look, a man  has got to wait for the perfect moment, ok?” Zell burst out  laughing. Irvine smacked him with the butt of his new gun but Zell  kept chuckling.</p>
<p>“Man my ass. Anyway,  last I saw she was looking for Quistis. They’re all prolly at the  cafeteria now anyway. Come on, let’s go get something to eat, man,  I’m starved! We always meet the gang for breakfast.” Zell said,  putting a hand over his stomach.</p>
<p>“We  always meet the gang for breakfast, would be a shame to make the  ladies wait.” Irvine replied and the two walked out of the training  center.</p>
<p>When they got to the  cafeteria, Xu and Quistis were laughing together. Irvine promptly sat  down while Zell rushed to get his spot in line.</p>
<p>“Howdy ladies. Have  you seen a certain brunette…maybe, 5’2 ish…”</p>
<p>“She’s collapsed  on my couch.” Xu replied loftily.</p>
<p>“Really? Now why  would she be there?” Irvine asked, scratching his head.</p>
<p>“She was looking for  me.” Quistis explained “We ended up crashing at Xu’s place.”  As if on cue, Selphie walked in, looking rather perplexed. She  stopped short of the table and when Irvine scooted over to make room,  she didn’t take a seat. She stared from Xu to Quistis, eyebrows  knitted together in slight confusion.</p>
<p>“I could’ve  sworn…” She began and then backtracked. “I had the weirdest  dream…I mean, I’m pretty sure it’s a dream but it was really  real. And by really real it’s a little hazy but still…” Quistis  smiled innocently.</p>
<p>“What kind of dream  was it…?” Selphie frowned.</p>
<p>“Before I tell you  guys, you have to swear not to laugh or anything. And I swear, I’m  not like that.” Beneath the table, Xu grabbed Quistis’s hand and  squeezed it gently.</p>
<p>“We won’t laugh.  It’s just a dream, right Selphie?” Xu replied all too cattily.  Selphie pouted.</p>
<p>“I swear by Hyne!  I’m not like that!” She insisted.</p>
<p>“We get it, Selphie.  What did you dream about?” Quistis said calmly.</p>
<p>“I dreamt…well, I  dreamt that I got up and walked into your room, Xu, and I saw you and  Quistis all snuggled and kissing.” The brunette turned bright red.  “It was a stupid dream.”</p>
<p>“I like your  dreams.” Irvine said with a grin. “Let me join your dreams!”  Selphie pouted and sat down.</p>
<p>“It was so real…”  She sighed.</p>
<p>“Who knows, Selphie.  Maybe Xu and I really are lovers.” Quistis said. Xu nearly choked  on her muffin.</p>
<p>“You know, they say  that dreams are the key to your inner desires.” Irvine noted  lecherously. Selphie smacked him.</p>
<p>“I am NOT like  that!”</p>
<p>“What are you  yelling about now?” Rinoa laughed as she and Squall approached  their table. “Sorry we’re late. Squall had some random phone call  from this creepy girl asking Squall to father her children.” Zell  followed shortly, his mouth already stuffed full with food. There  were remnants of what once was an omelet.</p>
<p>“You pig.” Ayane  sighed.</p>
<p>“Well, the whole  gang is here. Tell ‘em your story, Selphie.” Irvine said loudly.  Selphie turned even redder. “Come on…tell ‘em.”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Tell us!”  Rinoa chided. Quistis smiled brightly and stood up to throw away her  trash but not before leaning over and saying,</p>
<p>“I can’t wait  until I can actually kiss you in front of these people.” Xu blushed  and watched her, Selphie’s voice in the background rambling about  how her story meant absolutely nothing. <em>Come what may…</em>she  thought and stood up, following Quistis.</p>
<p>“I swear! My dream  meant nothing! You guys have to believe me before I tell you.”</p>
<p>Xu made her way  towards her. Her feet seemed to drag but she knew they weren’t.  SeeD weren’t trained to drag their feet as they walked.</p>
<p>“Selphie, just tell  us.”</p>
<p>Xu kept walking as  Quistis turned around and looked at her quizzically.</p>
<p>“Well, in my dream…I  was getting a drink…”</p>
<p>Xu grabbed Quistis’s  wrist before her mind registered that she had done that action. It  came as a bit of a surprise to her when she finally realized she was  holding her hand.</p>
<p>“And Quistis was in  Xu’s room in the same bed.”</p>
<p>Xu leaned in…</p>
<p>“And they were  kissi…”</p>
<p>Xu kissed Quistis,  surprising her at first, but Quistis gradually relaxed.</p>
<p>Six mouths dropped  open. An omelet, tray and a glass of orange juice fell to the ground.  One of the six people choked on her milk. And as Xu wrapped her arms  around Quistis’s waist and Quistis rested her arms on Xu’s  shoulders, Selphie whispered,</p>
<p>“I told you it  wasn’t a dream…”</p>
