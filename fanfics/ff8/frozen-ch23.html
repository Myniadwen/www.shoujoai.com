Quistis tipped the bellhop handsomely then sent him on his way. Fujin 
meanwhile stood quietly in the middle of the small but comfortable room. 
With a sigh she folded her arms and rubbed her shoulders.

&quot;You okay?&quot; Quistis asked as she started unpacking her bags.

Fujin nodded solemnly.

&quot;Why do I not believe that.&quot; Quistis replied playfully, getting no 
response she set her clothes aside and walked to her side.

&quot;Fu?&quot; She said softly her eyes worried.

&quot;YES?&quot; Fujin mumbled as she slowly looked at her with a haunted 
expression.

&quot;Something&#146;s wrong, what is it.&quot;

Fujin stared into her eyes, trying to get a sense something in their 
azure depths.

&quot;THINKING.&quot; She whispered.

&quot;About?&quot; Quistis sat on the edge of the solitary bed.

Fujin watched her and offered a shadowed smile.

&quot;NOTHING, AIRSICK.&quot;

Quistis nodded slowly, not wanting to press her.

&quot;Okay hon, if you want lay down for awhile I&#146;ll unpack for you.&quot;

&quot;BE OKAY.&quot; Fujin assured her.

&quot;What do you think of the room? By the way why did you want a single.&quot;

&quot;TWIN EXPENSIVE.&quot; She said sharply

&quot;Ah.&quot; Quistis nodded and looked around. &quot;Fu I told you it&#146;s my treat 
don&#146;t worry about the price. How are we going to handle the sleeping 
arrangements?&quot; She smiled softly.

&quot;To be honest I don&#146;t mind sharing, it&#146;s not like you snore or 
anything.&quot; She said breezily.

&quot;TAKE COUCH.&quot; Fujin said with a gesture towards the small loveseat near 
the door.

&quot;Oh please you&#146;ll do no such thing.&quot; Quistis all but laughed at the 
thought.

Fujin rubbed her eye with her palm and sighed.

&quot;What am I doing?&quot; She asked herself.

&quot;Are you sure your okay hon, you seem upset can I help?&quot;

&quot;AFFIR, ....YES.&quot; She coughed sharply.

She was lost had no idea how to handle the twisting emotions raging in 
her head. Her chest was tight and she was nearly nauseous from anxiety.

Quistis bite her lip and watched her friend, she was getting worried 
about her.

&quot;Fu?&quot;

&quot;EXPLORATION?&quot; Fujin said finally, with an odd smirk.

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis said baffled.

&quot;LOOK AROUND?&quot;

&quot;You want to look around. I guess we can, if you&#146;re up to it?&quot; Quistis 
replied, somewhat wary. Fujin nodded briskly. She would agree to 
anything to could get her mind on other things.

&quot;Okay then.&quot; Quistis stood up and smiled. &quot;Where to?&quot;

Fujin shrugged and made a face, she had no clue what to even look for.

&quot;Alright then come on.&quot;

&quot;WHERE?&quot;

&quot;First we need ski gear.&quot;

&quot;Ski?&quot;

&quot;Yeah silly, this IS a Ski resort. Do you know how by chance?&quot;

Fujin just arched a brow as if to signify the ludicrousness of the 
question.

&quot;Well I&#146;ll teach you then, if not there&#146;s plenty to do I&#146;m sure.&quot; 
Quistis dug through her luggage and withdrew a huge white and blue 
winter coat. Fujin reached into her gunnysack and pulled out an old 
leather bomber jacket.

&quot;What the heck is that thing? You can&#146;t wear that you&#146;ll freeze to 
death.&quot;

Fujin nearly looked insulted as she inspected the garment.

&quot;BE FINE.&quot; She said simply as she slipped it on.

&quot;Where&#146;s your dress coat, that&#146;s better than that thing?&quot;

&quot;LOST IT.&quot; She lied.

&quot;You&#146;re a terrible liar did you know that.&quot; Quistis said sternly, 
putting her hands on her hips. &quot;What happened?&quot;

Fujin rolled her eye in frustration.

&quot;SOLD IT.&quot;

&quot;What, why?&quot;

&quot;SUPPLIES.&quot; Quistis was right she was a horrible liar but she didn&#146;t 
want her friend to fuss over her.

&quot;Wait a minute.&quot; Quistis said with a shrewd look then wagged a finger at 
her.

&quot;Your not drawing money anymore from Balamb and that champagne had to be 
expensive.&quot;

&quot;SO.&quot;

&quot;I think you sold you Jacket for it.&quot;

&quot;SO.&quot;

&quot;Darn it Fujin.&quot; Quistis rubbed her face with her hands and sighed 
deeply. &quot;Okay, okay nothing to do about it now.&quot; She finally said with a 
grim smile. Fujin suddenly felt a bit like a scolded child. Quistis 
looked at her as if sizing her up and making her feel slightly awkward.

&quot;That jacket will not do you any good, and to be honest I don&#146;t think 
your other one would have been much better.&quot;

&quot;PROTEST.&quot;

&quot;Oh hush.&quot;

&quot;HUMPF&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re just in a mood today aren&#146;t you.&quot; Quistis smirked at her.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Uh huh sure your not.&quot;

&quot;NOT.&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot; Quistis smiled smugly as she fished her credit card from 
her purse.

&quot;They have a store downstairs, we&#146;ll just see if we can&#146;t get you into 
something a little more fitting.&quot;

&quot;BE FINE.&quot;

Quistis leaned over to put a finger to Fujin&#146;s lips shushing her.

&quot;That&#146;s enough out of you miss.&quot;

&quot;BUT.&quot;

&quot;No buts.&quot;

&quot;I.&quot;

Quistis leaned closer, looking her in the eye.

&quot;Let me do this for you.&quot; She said in a soft whisper.

Fujin&#146;s lips parted to speak in further protest and found that she was 
unable to move. She starred silently into her eyes feeling suddenly 
insecure and shy Fujin felt herself blushing and struggled to repress 
it.

&quot;Are you sure you&#146;re ok.&quot; Quistis reached out with and brushed an errant 
lock silvery hair from her face.

&quot;YES.&quot; She said somewhat hoarse.

Quistis raised back upright and smiled merrily.

&quot;Well let&#146;s go get you some gear then.&quot;

The store was small but well stocked, the walls brimmed with a wide 
assortment of heavy coats, ski&#146;s, boot&#146;s, flares, backpacks, hats, 
scarves, goggles, gloves and a plethora of other gear that Fujin could 
only imagine the purpose of. She stood in awkward silence as Quistis 
talked to the sales personnel. A heavy dark blue and purple coat caught 
her eye and she went to inspect it. She found herself smiling as she 
thought about how Quistis had been fussing over her lately.

&quot;Strange.&quot; She thought.

She wasn&#146;t troubled by it though and that surprised her. She was usually 
not one to enjoy having to rely on anyone, but with Quistis she somehow 
enjoyed the attention. Things where falling into place now she felt, 
though she was still unsure what it all would bring.

&quot;QUI...&quot; She started only to stop as she looked over see Quistis talking 
to some preppy looking fellow.

The man was tall, tan, and handsome with a scholarly air about him, a 
doctor perhaps. He was obviously wealthy, with his designer coat, large 
gold watch and meticulous hairstyle. Without realizing it she hid behind 
the rack of coats to observe.

&quot;So, Quistis was it? Interesting name, quite lovely. What brings you out 
here?&quot; The man said with a deep melodic voice.

&quot;I&#146;m here on vacation for a few days. What about yourself?&quot; Quistis 
asked smilingly as she casually fished through a spinning rack of 
sunglasses.

&quot;I&#146;m here with some clients, I&#146;m CEO of land contractor in Deling City.

&quot;Impressive.&quot; Quistis arched a brow and smirked.

&quot;What about you, what do you do for a living?&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m teacher among a few other things.&quot; She replied with a blas&eacute; tone.

&quot;Oh really where at?&quot;

&quot;Balamb.&quot;

&quot;Very interesting indeed. The SEED school I presume?&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s the one.&quot;

The man whistled in surprise.

&quot;Wow now it&#146;s my turn to be impressed.&quot;

Quistis laughed faintly.

Fujin walked up to the two of them with a not so amused expression. She 
stood next to Quistis and locked her crimson gaze on the man.

&quot;Um hello.&quot; The man said curiously the looked at Quistis. &quot;Friend of 
yours?&quot;

Fujin leaned her hip against her in an easy, intimate motion. Quistis 
glanced down at her with a somewhat shocked expression. Fujin didn&#146;t 
look at her but kept her focus on the gentleman before them.

&quot;Yes it is.&quot; Quistis smiled with near twinkle of pride in her voice, and 
trying desperately not to laugh.

&quot;Fujin this is.&quot; She looked quizzically at the man. &quot;I didn&#146;t get your 
name?&quot;

&quot;Bryce.&quot; He said thinly as he tried not to make eye contact with small 
woman glaring at him.

&quot;Bryce. Bryce this is Fujin.&quot; Quistis said politely.

&quot;The man offered his hand to shake.

&quot;Nice to meet you Fujin.&quot;

She ignored it and kept her gaze locked upon him. Quistis shrugged 
wordlessly.

Bryce clucked his tongue sourly and withdrew his hand. He looked back to 
Quistis and smiled broadly.

&quot;We&#146;ll I have to run. Hope to see you again sometime.&quot; He said with a 
fading sense of hope.

&quot;Who knows.&quot; Quistis smirked.

&quot;See you later then.&quot; He looked at Fujin who still hounded him with her 
gaze. &quot;Miss.&quot; He nodded to her and left hurriedly. Fujin waited till he 
was out of site then went over to the coat she was looking at.

Quistis stood watching her and was at a loss for words or actions for a 
moment. Finally she walked softly up to her and looked at the coat.

&quot;I guess you found what you want.&quot; Quistis said with cryptic smile

Fujin didn&#146;t meet her gaze but nodded quietly.</pre>
