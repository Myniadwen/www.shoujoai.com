Morning smiles
like the face of a newborn child,
innocent, unknowing.

Winter&#39;s end
promises of a long lost friend.
Speaks to me of comfort

But I fear
I have nothing to give.
I have so much to loose here in this lonely place.
Tangled up in your embrace
There&#39;s nothing I&#39;d like better than to fall.
But I fear I have nothing to give.

Wind in time
Rapes the flower trembling on the vine
And nothing yields to shelter it from above.
The say temptation will destroy our love.
The never ending hunger

But I fear
I have nothing to give
I have so much to loose here in this lonely place
Tangled up in our embrace
There&#146;s nothing I&#39;d like better than to fall
But I fear I have nothing to give.
I have so much to loose.
I have nothing to give.
We have so much to lose...

 


Fear

Quistis awoke the next morning her senses slightly dulled from the wine. 
She didn&#146;t care, she felt better than she had in a long time. She lay in 
thought for a long moment before rolling out of bed. She quietly padded 
to her bedroom door and peeked out. Fujin was still there and sleeping 
soundly, a shy smile came to Quistis&#146;s lips and she went and sat back on 
her bed.

&quot;What&#146;s wrong with you.&quot; She asked herself curiously.

&quot;Just happy to have new friend who I can relate to?&quot;

&quot;Bullshit. You where being a bit more than friendly don&#146;t you think.&quot; 
Quistis made a shocked face at the thought. She did admit she felt 
something last night that was a little out of the ordinary.

&quot;A little? You where damn near lustful.&quot; Quistis knew for a fact she did 
not want to even think about that and quickly went to take a shower.

********************************

She felt herself drowning in the emotions that that threatened to wash 
away her very being, so alien but so welcome. It started so innocently 
with just a gentle touch entwined with subtle promises of passion. 
Delicious dreams came all to easily, two bodies entwined in a dance as 
old as time itself. The quiet sharing of wants and desires until they 
became one in ecstasy.

Fujin sat up with such abruptness she deposited herself in a heap on the 
floor. She looked about in terror unsure where she was. Then it came 
back to her and she quickly relaxed.

&quot;Some dream.&quot; She mused darkly. Never had she had a dream like that much 
less of that intensity. She had buried all thoughts like that a long 
time ago. She didn&#146;t dwell on it she never liked giving power to dreams. 
She couldn&#146;t ignore how warm she felt how her body tingled.

&quot;Bizarre.&quot; She murmured as she looked about, the sun was gleamed through 
the blinds. The scent of coffee and eggs hung in the air.

&quot;QUISITS?&quot; Fujin stood her legs still fairly stiff. She then noticed a 
letter laying on the table near the couch. She picked it and read it 
assuming it to be for her.

&quot;Hiya Fuu.

I have a class this morning. I would have woke you but you seemed so 
peaceful. Anyway I made you coffee and breakfast its waiting for you in 
the warmer. Thanks for staying for dinner it was interesting, though I 
apologize for acting like a ninny earlier. Feel free to make yourself at 
home just lock up before you leave. Take care hope to see you later.

Your friend Quistis

Fujin stood quietly looking at the paper her face unreadable. She looked 
to the kitchen and noticed the empty champagne bottle sitting atop the 
counter. She thought about everything last night and soon found herself 
trembling.

***************************

Quistis sat behind her desk watching the students file into the 
classroom. Rinoa was among them as was Luccian who was limping 
noticeably. He was a handsome young man tall, and muscular. He reminded 
her a bit of Seifer, though Luccian wore a coat as black as his spiked 
hair. His personality was boisterous and proud he came from the class 
right under Squall and the others. He made a name for himself quickly 
and though a jackass, he took control of the Disciplinary Committee. 
About time he was taken down a peg she thought to herself. She looked at 
Rinoa who was smiling at her affectionately. Quistis smiled back but 
kept it to a minimum, she didn&#146;t want the impression of playing class 
favorites. The Treppies, some of them old some of them new all watched 
her intently like she was a demigoddess waiting to pass down judgment. 
She found them annoying at times but was flattered non the less. 
Everyone found their seats and settled down.

&quot;Okay class. Some of you are new so I will introduce myself.&quot; She wrote 
her name on the board behind her. &quot;My name is Quistis Trepe.&quot; The 
Treppies applauded and cheered causing her to blush. She gave them a 
sharp look causing them to giggled and quieted down. Rinoa sat with a 
smart-ass grin on her face at the commotion. Quistis knew she would hear 
about it later.

&quot;Now then I will be your teacher this semester. During which we will be 
going over the concept and use of various magic&#146;s as well as Guardian 
Forces. Not all of you will deal with either of these energies, but it&#146;s 
good to have the information available and is a mandatory requirement 
for the SEED program. We will also be going over regional history 
including Dollet, Trabia, Galbania, and Balamb. Later will also go into 
some of the truths and myths about Eshtar and the Sorceress Wars.&quot; Rinoa 
sunk into her seat at the mention of that, being a sorceress herself. It 
was decided a year ago by everyone concerned that it was for the best to 
keep Rinoa&#146;s secret while she was a student.

&quot;Okay before I begin how about you all stand up and introduce yourselves 
to the class.&quot;

********************

Selphie sat outside the classroom door later that afternoon fit to burst 
she hated being kept in the dark. Rinoa had started to tell her 
something about Quistis over breakfast but left midway through claiming 
to be late for class. Selphie was frothing at the bit by time the last 
bell rang. The students burst out of the door chattering excitedly to 
themselves. Selphie had to work to squeeze through the masses. She 
looked for Rinoa who stood in front of Quistis&#146;s desk with a bunch of 
Treppies. Quistis had her head buried in her hands shaking it slowly. 
Selphie walked up and pinched Rinoa&#146;s arm and gave her a dirty look.

&quot;OUCH!&quot; Rinoa yelped as she jerked her arm and gawked at the scowling 
girl. Everyone was looking at them now. Selphie simply put on her cutest 
grin and waved merrily.

&quot;Hi Quisty what&#146;s up?&quot;

Quistis looked at her with a tired grin then shot Rinoa a accusing look. 
The Treppies all jostled each other.

&quot;Tell her Rinoa.&quot; Quistis said dryly. This prompted more giggles from 
the surrounding Treppies.

Rinoa fished in her pocket and pulled out a small card with Quistis&#146;s 
gleaming face on the front. She held it out proudly for Selphie to see.

&quot;I am now a card carrying Treppie.&quot; Rinoa said with a bright giggle.

&quot;Omigod!&quot; Selphie exploded into laughter and turned to Quistis who 
regarded them only faintly bemused as she gathered her things.

&quot;Real cute guys.&quot; She said as she slipped her bag over her shoulder.

&quot;Oh I wanna join to!&quot; Selphie giggled and hopped merrily.

&quot;Sorry Selph.&quot; Rinoa said almost proudly. &quot;You have to be one of her 
students, rules are rules.&quot;

Quistis glared through slits at all of them, her lips pursed annoyance.

&quot;Oh I don&#146;t know Rinoa.&quot; Said Royce the present head of the Treppie fan 
club. He was a lean attractive man with dark skin. He was well behaved 
and a top student a shoe in for SEED.

&quot;Oh really really really!&quot; Selphie hopped up and down.

&quot;Sure we can make you and honorary member.&quot; He said with a dazzling 
grin. He reminded Selphie of Laguna&#146;s friend Kiros.

&quot;YAHHH!&quot; Selphie shouted and hugged him. Causing the other Treppies, 
Rinoa included to oooh and ahhh. He blushed and tried to keep his 
composure.

&quot;Um yeah well no problem.&quot; He coughed.

Quistis took the opportunity to escape unnoticed, a playful smile spread 
on her face as she slipped out the door.

***************************

After everyone left Selphie and Rinoa walked up the hall. Selphie toyed 
with her new Treppie card.

&quot;Well?&quot;

&quot;Well what?&quot; Rinoa said as they stepping into the elevator at the end of 
the hall.

&quot;Tell me about Quistis!&quot; She said with a huff and jabbed to down button.

&quot;Well I went over there late last night and...&quot; A hand jabbed into the 
door as it tried to close causing it to open again. Selphie and Rinoa 
looked up and both looked somewhat taken aback as Fujin stepped into the 
elevator with out a word.

&quot;Well? Finish the story!&quot; She Selphie huffed not really caring either 
way about Fujin.

&quot;Umm.&quot; Rinoa babbled.

Fujin leaned against the wall lost in thought. Rinoa meanwhile made 
funny noises trying to get Selphie to shut up.

&quot;Just tell me!&quot; Selphie said getting flustered. Rinoa leaned down and 
whispered harshly.

&quot;Not now!&quot; She glanced at Fujin who was still ignoring them.

&quot;What her?&quot; Selphie thumbed towards the silver-hared demon. Rinoa&#146;s eyes 
bugged.

&quot;She could care less about Quistis just spill the beans please!&quot; Selphie 
spouted, Rinoa wanted to faint. Fujin glanced in their direction her 
expression as cold and aloof as always. Rinoa waved with a embarrassed 
and all together idiotic grin. Selphie just looked between the two 
completely lost. Then she remembered the Jacket Quistis had. With out a 
word Selphie just turned around and banged her head on the wall.

The door opened and Rinoa and Selphie all but ran out. Fujin paid them 
no head and stayed on board. Rinoa stalked up the walkway incensed she 
had never felt like such a buffoon. Selphie ran up behind her.

&quot;So tell me what you know and I will tell you what I know&quot; Selphie said 
with a detached calm.

&quot;Nothing really.&quot; Rinoa shrugged &quot;I just went over to Quistis&#146;s room 
late last night to see how your shopping went and Fujin answered the 
door. She said Quisty was in the shower then shut the door in my face.&quot;

&quot;That makes sense.&quot; Selphie chirped.

&quot;Huh what makes sense?&quot; Rinoa asked feeling a bit left out now.

&quot;She had a special edition Balamb dress jacket.&quot; Selphie said simply as 
they walked into the cafeteria. Zell stood in line a few feet ahead of 
them and waved. They waved back absently.

&quot;Who did?&quot; Rinoa asked getting more and more confused.

&quot;Quistis.&quot;

&quot;When, and so what if she did?&quot; Rinoa shrugged.

&quot;Yesterday when I went to pick her up it was laying at the foot of her 
bed.&quot;

&quot;So?&quot;

&quot;So that was what Fujin may have been over there for.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;It was Fujin&#146;s jacket it had to be she&#146;s the only one I ever seen with 
one. &quot;

&quot;What? You said it was Quistis&#146;s. jacket&quot; Rinoa felt like she was being 
double talked.

&quot;No I mean I thought it was Quistis&#146;s.&quot; Selphie said evenly.

&quot;Okay so what?&quot;

&quot;Quistis probably found her coat and she came to get it back.&quot; Selphie 
concluded.

&quot;Ah okay, and here I was thinking something was afoot.&quot; Rinoa laughed.

&quot;What are you serious?&quot;

&quot;I dunno Fujin just seemed bothered by me coming there.&quot;

&quot;Duh she hates us silly.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s true, why did she even come back then?&quot;

&quot;Who knows with her attitude I couldn&#146;t even see how Seifer put up with 
her as long as he did.&quot; Selphie smirked.

&quot;Oh that was mean.&quot; Rinoa stared in surprise at friend.

&quot;Yeah right you obviously forgot what she did.&quot;

&quot;Well no.&quot; She said softly. She really didn&#146;t like talking about Seifer 
considering their past. She had actually met Fujin before she met the 
others. She was dating Seifer for a short time during which Fujin would 
watch her like a hawk. She just assumed she was protective of Seifer but 
after everything was said and done she knew there was more to it. She 
knew Fujin had to be hurting since he and then her brother left her 
alone. She had no love for Fujin but she did see where she was coming 
from in some regards.

&quot;Come on we&#146;re up.&quot; Selphie nodded towards the line, it was their turn 
to get their plates.

******************

Fujin stood in her chamber stoically, she looked around a moment then 
with a heavy sigh she slung a large duffel bag over her shoulder. It was 
time to go she noted as she looked at the clock. The train would be 
leaving Galbania within the next hour as was the Garden, she could 
already hear the Engines humming to life. She looked at the azure 
tickets in her hand without a hint of regret, her mind was made up. She 
switched off the lights a walked towards the lift.

She sat on a bench at the station feeling impossible alone even amidst 
all the other passengers and lost in thought. Her heart further sank as 
she heard she magical sound of chimes mixed with a distinct mechanical 
hum that could only be Balamb&#146;s engines. She looked into the distance 
and saw the Garden rise slowly above the sunset. With a grace that 
seemed out of place for a structure of its size it moved out over the 
ocean. Its rainbow array of lights radiated across the darkening 
landscape like a kaleidoscope as it moved over the horizon. It&#146;s beauty 
took her breath away, the other passengers apparently agreed as they 
stared in wonder.

**************************

Quistis did not care much for the after class meetings Cid loved to 
spring on her and the other instructors. They always ran long and where 
always boring. This time was no exception it was well after seven when 
she left. She had really wanted to go into town and pick something up, 
but the Garden had already pulled out. They where now on there way to 
Trabia to pick up some last minute transfer students. It could wait she 
told herself as, she arrived at her apartment.

She looked down at her door and saw a folder sticking out from under it. 
She knelt and retrieved it, a group of reports on promising students by 
the looks of it. She tucked the folder under her arm and unlocked the 
door. Flipping on the lights she grinned at what greeted her. The place 
was absolutely spotless even the dishes where done.

&quot;How sweet.&quot; She cooed and set her things by her desk and kicked of her 
shoes. The light on her answering machine was beeping and she pressed it 
a zeal that she found annoyingly girlish.

&quot;Hey Quistis this is Cid we have another meeting tomorrow at 5 please be 
there.&quot;

&quot;Ugh&quot; Quistis droned and hit the next messege.

&quot;Hey Quistiy this is Nicole just wanted to see if ya wanted to come over 
and watch a few movies with me and Zell.&quot; Quistis groaned in dismay. 
Last time she did that she ended up watching the movie by herself, while 
sounds of wild monkey sex accosted her from the other room. She hit the 
next msg.

&quot;Um Miss Trepe this is Iggy Kingsly. I was just wondering if you wanted 
to go out with me this weekend.&quot; Quistiis rolled her eyes, Iggy was a 
lovesick Treppie from 3rd quarter.

She frowned upon seeing that there where no more messages. She 
unbuttoned her blouse and let her hair down. She had hoped to get a note 
or something.

&quot;Thats odd.&quot; She whispered.

There was a knock on the door and she jumped up. She all but ran to the 
door and opened it.

&quot;Black lace fits you lady.&quot; Irvine said with a whistle and a smile. 
Selphie stomped his foot harshly

Quistis screamed and slammed the door in their face, She quickly 
buttoned her shirt.

&quot;Idiot, Idiot, Idiot&quot; She screamed at herself. With her remaining 
dignity she opened the door again.

Irvine was hobbling about in the hall behind Selphie who stood perturbed 
and wagging a finger at her.

&quot;You need to be more careful. Honestly, going around answering the door 
in your lacies, you should know better. What if we where Squall and Cid&quot; 
The mental picture of such a event made her laugh aloud. Quistis herself 
even had to grin at thought. She stood aside and motioned them to come 
in.

&quot;What brings you two to my humble abode.&quot; Quistis said in surprise as 
her guests sat down on her couch.

&quot;Well we where thinking about your upcoming birthday in a few weeks.&quot; 
Irvine started. Quistis all but forgot about it herself she hadn&#146;t 
really cared considering her state of mind lately. She had wondered why 
everyone had taken a interest in her lately and now she had her answer.

&quot;What about it?&quot; Quistis said as she ran her fingers through her hair 
idly working out the kinks.

&quot;Anyway.&quot; Selphie started with a impish grin. &quot;We where wondering what 
you would like.&quot;

&quot;Oh gods Selphie, to be honest I have not thought about it, so I have no 
Clue.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s a cop out and you know it ya brat.&quot; Selphie stuck her tongue out 
at her.

&quot;Selphie I don&#146;t care really, just surprise me.&quot;

&quot;Well I am sure I can think of something.&quot; Irvine smirked devilishly.

&quot;That&#146;s about enough out of you, you rogue.&quot; Quistis said sternly.

&quot;Ignore him he&#146;s just retarded.&quot; Selphie grinned as she pushed him away.

&quot;Hey now.&quot; Irvine stammered slightly offended.

&quot;Guys really, just surprise me it&#146;s okay, just no stripper like last 
time.&quot;

&quot;Sorry about that.&quot; Irvine said. &quot;Did the stain come out?&quot;

The two girls looked at him sourly. He threw his hands up defensively.

&quot;Okay, Okay I&#146;m shutting up.&quot;

Selphie stared at him a moment before continuing.

&quot;All right then Quisty, we will come up with something.&quot; Selphie hopped 
up and pulled Kinneas to his feet. &quot;Well we are off then. We arrive at 
Trabia tomorrow and I need a good nights sleep.&quot; Quistis stood and 
walked them to the door.

&quot;Okay then thanks for stopping by.&quot;

They walked out into the hall and Irvine poked his head back in.

&quot;Next try a push up they are extra sexy.&quot; He said wolfishly and winked. 
Quistis groaned and shoved him out the door. She could her Selphie 
yelling at him as they walked up the hall. She laughed to herself as she 
went to get ready for bed.

*********************************

Squall caught a punch to the face and he staggered. Zell winced then 
paused a moment only to be tackled. He grabbed Squall by the collar then 
used his moment against him, Zell rolled onto his back and used his legs 
to propel his squad leader through the air. Squall fell unceremoniously 
on his back with a loud thud onto the mat. Nicole and Rinoa giggled from 
the sidelines. Squall was unbeatable with his gunblade but was sorely 
lacking in hand to hand. Zell was wiping the floor with him. Squall 
looked upside down at Zell who walked over to him and offered him a 
hand. He scowled lightly and took it.

&quot;There, there buddy.&quot; Zell clapped him on back. &quot;Give it time, then you 
will be kicking ass with the best of them.&quot;

Squall eyed him warily he got the distinct impression Zell was enjoying 
their training sessions far to much.

Rinoa and Nicole walked over grinning and going on about parties and 
gifts.

&quot;What are you to busy bodies up to.&quot; Zell quipped. Rinoa made a face at 
him.

&quot;Quistis&#146;s birthday is coming up we where just making plans.&quot; Nicole 
offered.

&quot;That reminds me Squall.&quot; Did you ever get a chance to talk to her. 
Squall soured.

&quot;I tried.&quot; Was all he said.

&quot;Well what happened?&quot;

&quot;She walked off.&quot; He shrugged

&quot;Gracious.&quot; Rinoa shook her head. Zell smirked and clapped his friend on 
the shoulder once more.

&quot;Women my amigo.&quot; He whispered in his ear. &quot;They are a fickle creature 
best be on your toes, I smell something in the air.&quot;

Squall nodded in solemn agreement, all this talk about Quistis had him 
thinking. He was not as oblivious as one would think, Rinoa told him 
deal with the Quistis and the jacket. He also happened to see Fujin 
leave Quistis&#146;s apartment this afternoon while he dropped of some 
paperwork. She seemed troubled and didn&#146;t even see him. He decided to do 
a little check up later and found out She had left the garden right 
before they took off apparently for good by the looks of it. Something 
was up and Quistis had the answers.

***********************************

Quistis arrived at her classroom early the next morning. A few of the 
student where standing in the hall chattering to themselves. She went in 
and plopped down at her desk. She was feeling a bit down this morning 
she had hoped to run into Fujin, but had seen not hide nor hair of her.

&quot;I hope everything&#146;s okay?&quot; She thought worriedly.

Luccian and Archibald came into class and Luccian was talking in excited 
whispers. She paid him no mind and went to finish up some last minute 
notes. She heard Archibald mention Fujin&#146;s name and looked up 
immediately. The two boys sat in there seats intently talking. She 
pretended to work while trying to listen. She knew Luccian and her 
bumped heads and grew worried.

&quot;Your kidding man really?&quot; Luccian whispered excitedly.

&quot;Yup saw her with my own two eyes.&quot; Archibald said confidently. &quot;She had 
a big bag and everything. She was heading to the train station by looks 
of it.&quot;

&quot;Huh imagine that. Guess we don&#146;t have to worry about her anymore.&quot; 
Luccian said obviously pleased.

&quot;Yeah really she beat your ass man.&quot;

&quot;Somebitch.&quot; Luccian hissed and punched him in the arm as hard as he 
could.

Quistis sat horrified.

&quot;I chased her away.&quot; She whispered as hot tears begin to well up. The 
bell rang and the rest of the class poured into the room.</pre>
