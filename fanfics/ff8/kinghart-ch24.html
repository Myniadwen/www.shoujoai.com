<p>“The most important  thing you need to know about magic is that it isn’t endless. Use it  wisely. I’m sure I’ve quizzed you all to no end about elemental  weaknesses but I cannot stress how many Blizzagas you will save if  you just use a Holy against the undead.” Quistis said. “If I may  remind all of you, only one person got a perfect score on that last  exam. As entertaining as some of the responses were…” She picked  up a random quiz on her desk and read it. “Let’s see…question  4. ‘What is the best magic to use against a bomb? Answer: FIRE FIRE  FIRE FIRE! FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE!’” She looked at the class but  few of them were paying attention. This was due in part to Selphie  and Zell standing near the doorway staring at her with mouths wide  open. Irvine and Rinoa had followed Xu and were no doubt doing the  same as she did her paperwork. She sighed and turned to Selphie and  Zell.</p>
<p>“Do you two mind?  I’m trying to teach a class here and you gaping at me won’t help  a thing.”</p>
<p>“Babbb…buuubb…you…gaaa?”  Zell babbled.</p>
<p>“If there’s  something you want to discuss, we’ll discuss it after class. In the  mean time, please, OUT.” She said angrily, pointing at the door.  The two shuffled sideways outside and the class giggled. Quistis  rubbed her forehead. She didn’t regret coming out to the gang, it  was just how they went about it.</p>
<p>“CLASS!” She  shouted. “Focus. As I was saying, since you all did so poorly, you  will have another quiz in the following three days. I think it would  be in your best interest to pass this one.”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>When Quistis finished  the morning class, she sighed and slumped down in her desk. The door  opened again and Xu walked in.</p>
<p>“You do realize you  have some people out there who look a bit lock jawed, right?” She  said with a smile. Quistis smiled.</p>
<p>“Can’t be helped.  Our little secret wasn’t exactly exposed in the most graceful  manner.” She replied, sticking out her hand for Xu to take.</p>
<p>“We should talk to  them.” Xu suggested and Quistis nodded.</p>
<p>The two walked out and  almost smack into the gang. All of them were standing there, still  looking at the two rather shocked. Quistis and Xu fidgeted nervously,  unsure of how to begin.</p>
<p>“Will someone just  say something?” Xu blurted. Squall who had previously been leaning  against the wall, stood up straight.</p>
<p>“I don’t care what  you two do. It’s your private life, Quistis and I don’t want to  get involved.” He said calmly.</p>
<p>“I think we all just  need to talk about this like mature, sensi…”</p>
<p>“Oh enough of the  hesitation! When did you two start dating? Better yet, Quistis, when  did you get into girls?” Selphie demanded.</p>
<p>Quistis decided that  they were fair questions even though Xu looked like she disapproved  of them.</p>
<p>“Selphie, it’s  kind of hard to explain what we’ve been through. Let’s just say  we’ve been aware of each other’s feelings since my birthday. And  I’m not into all girls…just Xu.” She answered.</p>
<p>“I don’t get it.”  Rinoa said. “I mean…I’m not against it, I just don’t get it.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have  to, Rin. Suffice to say, I love Xu very much.” Quistis replied,  patting the girl on the head.</p>
<p>“Is that why you  rejected Arik…!” Selphie exclaimed. “Now it makes sense!”</p>
<p>“It’s cool by me.”  Irvine winked at the two. “Just let me know when you’re going to  have some playtime. I might join you. You know you can’t  resist…OW!” Selphie had kicked Irvine in the shins. “WOMAN!  Have you NOT heard of shin splints? Dr. Kadowaki has yet to heal  these…”</p>
<p>“I think it’s  cool.” Zell mumbled sheepishly, his face turning red.</p>
<p>“It seems like  everyone’s ok with it. Ayane, you haven’t said anything.” Rinoa  commented. Ayane looked up, startled.</p>
<p>“Oh! Uh, um, I  already knew.” She stammered.</p>
<p>“She was one of the  first to figure it out.” Quistis said, smiling at her.</p>
<p>“Who else knows?”  Squall asked seriously. “Quistis, I’m sure you remember the last  teacher who was caught in a same-sex relationship. I can’t protect  you if half the Garden turns on you.”</p>
<p>“Now that’s just  being pessimistic!” Xu snapped.</p>
<p>“Squall, I am  perfectly capable of handling this situation.” Quistis replied,  annoyed at how much people assumed it was the end of her career. “I  entered this relationship known the consequences, same for Xu. Both  of us know what might happen but we’re prepared.” She squeezed  Xu’s hand and looked at her fondly in the eyes. “Besides, I can  always go back to being a SeeD.”</p>
<p>Squall sighed and shook his head.</p>
<p>“Whatever.” He  said and walked away.</p>
<p>“Aw, he doesn’t  mean it.” Rinoa said. “He’s…he’s happy for you, really. We  haven’t seen you this happy in a while and it’s definitely good  to see that you’re at least capable of that.”</p>
<p>“Finally!” Selphie  exclaimed. “Now you can bring someone when we quadruple date!”  Quistis laughed and hugged the two of them.</p>
<p>“Woah! I’m not  sure if Squall would like to share!” Irvine commented. Selphie  glared at him.</p>
<p>“Irvine, may I have  a word with you about tact?”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Xu and Quistis  collapsed on the bed giggling. The two of them looked at each other,  love shining in their eyes.</p>
<p>“That turned out  better than I imagined.” Xu said.</p>
<p>“Told you.”  Quistis laughed, kissing the tip of her nose.</p>
<p>The two of them lay in  each other’s embrace, savoring the time they spent together. Xu  breathed in deeply, trying to memorize the moment by sight, sound,  smell and touch.</p>
<p>“It feels so good to  have you.” She whispered. Quistis smiled. It was late afternoon and  the sun was already setting. The two of them gazed out of the window  at the dreamy sight. Quistis held Xu loosely, feeling herself begin  to drift.</p>
<p>“Hm…you think  people are going to look at us differently?” Xu murmured.</p>
<p>“I hope no one  stares at you.” Quistis chuckled. Xu yawned cutely and curled up  against Quistis.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“Bombshell much?”  Selphie sighed as she and Irvine walked down the street. Selphie wore  a blue, slightly shimmering dress, something she had tucked away and  forgot about until she ransacked her closet trying to find something  to wear. Irvine wore a nice suit, something that wasn’t all that  comfortable to him but since the restaurant required a semi-formal  attire, he had no other choice.</p>
<p>“Well, to be honest,  I’m not surprised.” Selphie shot him a shocked look.</p>
<p>“You’re not?”</p>
<p>“Well, ok, maybe a  little surprised. But think about it, she and Xu go way back. They’re  best of friends!”</p>
<p>“So? Rinoa and I are  best friends too. Does that mean we’re lovers?” Selphie asked.</p>
<p>“Oh I hope so.”  Irvine muttered.</p>
<p>“What was that?”  Selphie snapped.</p>
<p>“I said, ‘you look  beautiful tonight.’” He replied quickly. Selphie blushed and  looked away.</p>
<p>“Well, you’re not  so bad either without those smelly boots and overly flamboyant cowboy  hat.” She mumbled.</p>
<p>“Sephy, let Quistis  do what she likes. We all agreed, she’s much happier, isn’t she?  She can handle it. Now, did I mention that you look beautiful  tonight?”</p>
<p>“As opposed to what?” Selphie joked.</p>
<p>“As opposed to ‘meh’  every other day.” Irvine and several other people had to duck as  Selphie threw her shoe at his head.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Squall sat in his  room, slightly dozing off. It has been such a long day, too long for  his liking. All his concerns escalated. With everything that was  going on, the attack on Winhill, Seifer, Ultimecia, Quistis and Xu  dating, he could hardly sleep well. This was elevated even more so  when Nida charged through the doors loudly.</p>
<p>“Squall, we’ve got  something you might want to see.”</p>
<p>“What is it, Nida?  It better be good.” He said, standing up and stretching. The two of  them made their way back to the cockpit.</p>
<p>“Galbadia  intercepted this transmission. You might want to listen.” Nida hit  a button.</p>
<p>“<em>Ffssss…We’ve  got what you want…fsss…sir…fsss…yes, the very necklace you  requested. Fsss…ou think? We took it off the girl. No, sir, it  comes as…fssss…no enjoyment of mine to know she’s still alive.  I’ll have to take care of the…fssss…irty work next time.</em>”</p>
<p>Squall had closed his eyes in concentration halfway through the  transmission. For a long while, he said nothing and barely moved.  Nida coughed, wondering if Squall had somehow fallen asleep in place.</p>
<p>“Sir?”</p>
<p>“Do you know where  the transmission came from?” Squall asked, snapping out of his near  asleep stage.</p>
<p>“Yes! We have the  general coordinates of where it came from. They came from Timber.  Other than that, we have no idea.” Squall thought for a moment.</p>
<p>“I’ll have the  usual team assembled by tomorrow morning. We’re going to check this  out as soon as possible.” He commanded. “Go get some sleep.”</p>
<p>Nida saluted and walked out of the room, stretching and yawning. As  soon as he disappeared, Squall’s eyes narrowed. He unsheathed his  gunblade and stared at it. Whoever had sent the transmission would  pay for hurting Rinoa.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“Hey guys, have you  seen Squall?” Rinoa asked the very next morning. Everyone looked  up.</p>
<p>“No, Rin. He’s  probably in his office, mulling over something.” Selphie replied.</p>
<p>“No…I checked  there this morning. He didn’t come back last night, I assumed he  had fallen asleep in his office or was busy working or something. But  I haven’t seen him this morning either which is weird.” Rinoa  sighed.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t worry  about it, Rin.” Quistis reassured. “He’s probably at the  training center. He’ll turn up eventually.”</p>
<p>By noon, Squall still  hadn’t turned up and everyone began to worry. The seven of them  split up. Selphie checked the infirmary, Rinoa checked the Quad, Zell  stayed in the cafeteria, Irvine took the dorms, Ayane took the  library, Quistis took the parking lot and Xu took the training  center. Still Squall was no where to be seen.</p>
<p>“You don’t think  he went into the basement, do you?” Quistis asked.</p>
<p>“No, the cameras in  the elevator show that Squall got out on the first floor. That’s  the last time he was seen.” Xu replied. She spotted Nida walking  towards them, whistling and carrying a tray of food.</p>
<p>“Good morning  everyone.” He said politely.</p>
<p>“Hey, Nida, you  haven’t seen Squall, have you?” Zell asked. Nida looked at them,  puzzled.</p>
<p>“Wait, he didn’t  call you guys in?” Nida answered.</p>
<p>“We haven’t seen  nor heard from him since yesterday.” Irvine said.</p>
<p>“That’s weird…just  last night…” Nida suddenly dropped his tray of food and went  pale. “Oh crap. Oh crap oh crap oh crap.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”  Rinoa demanded, on the verge of panicking.</p>
<p>Nida, ignoring the mess on  the floor, spread his arms and ushered everyone into the elevator.  Quistis’s stomach sank. She knew there was going to be trouble.  When the arrive on the third floor, Nida ran over to the radio.</p>
<p>“We received this  transmission that Galbadia intercepted. I played it to Squall…and…”  He played it again.</p>
<p>“<em>Ffssss…We’ve  got what you want…fsss…sir…fsss…yes, the very necklace you  requested. Fsss…ou think? We took it off the girl. No, sir, it  comes as…fssss…no enjoyment of mine to know she’s still alive.  I’ll have to take care of the…fssss…irty work next time.</em>”</p>
<p>Everyone knew.</p>
<p>“Where did this come  from?” Xu asked urgently.</p>
<p>“Timber! That’s as  precise a location as I could get.”</p>
<p>“Squall went there  by himself. If they don’t murder him, he’s going to murder them!”  Ayane shouted.</p>
<p>“Nida, set course  for Timber right now! If we’re lucky, we can intercept him before  it’s too late.” Quistis ordered.</p>
<p>Nida flung himself at the  controls, sending a brief message to the students before setting  course for Timber.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p><em>I thought I saw  something in the tunnel that time we took the train out of Timber.</em> Squall thought. He pressed himself against the slimy, graffiti  covered train tunnel one several yards away from the Timber train  station. A train rushed by him and he flattened himself even more  against the wall, feeling the train scrape a little of his fur  collar. He took a deep breath and jumped onto the tracks. Heat rose  from the hot metal and he tried not to step on it. He fished out a  small flashlight from his pocket and turned it on, searching along  the ground for something suspicious. <em>I thought it was a trick of  the mind. I knew I saw someone on these tracks!</em> He knew he had  precious time before the next train sped down his way. There seemed  to be nothing.</p>
<p><em>It couldn’t be a  trick of the mind! I know there was someone.</em> He continued along,  still searching. Had he passed it? He had judged the distance to be  around here. Suddenly, he heard the horn of the next train blaring. <em>NO! It’s early!</em> Squall looked along the sides of the wall  and began racing towards it. His foot got caught amongst all the  cables lined on the ground. He took out his gunblade and began hacking  at the wires as the train neared.</p>
<p>“NO!” He shouted.  “There’s someone here!”</p>
<p>It was no use. All the trains had  switched to computer conductors. No one could hear him. He hacked at  the ground feverishly. His foot came free and he raced towards the  wall.</p>
<p>Squall Leonhart was  gone in seconds.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Quistis slipped on her  boots and redid her hair. The two of them were in Quistis’s room,  changing out of their SeeD uniforms.</p>
<p>“Zip me up?”  Quistis asked.</p>
<p>“Quistis, your  zipper is in the front. You’re perfectly able to do it yourself.”  Xu replied, slipping into a much too small, leather jacket. The  bottom hem only reached to about her ribs. She wore a grey shirt  underneath and jean shorts.</p>
<p>“Oh  please, I know you want to.” Quistis said coyly. Xu sighed though a  smile crept onto her face. Quistis giggled as she walked towards her.</p>
<p>“What?  Oh please, don’t give me that.”</p>
<p>“You just look so  cute!” She exclaimed. “I haven’t seen you wear that in ages!”</p>
<p>“Please. I opted for  the practical. I’m a martial artist, Quisty. I can’t go around  doing the things I do in a skirt.”</p>
<p>Xu grabbed the zipper and tugged  downward, effectively blocking any view she normally would’ve  enjoyed. She grabbed her weapon and took it apart in the middle. She  hooked one on either side of her and looked in the mirror.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“My, my, my. Squall  Leonhart in the flesh.” Squall groaned and tried to move his head.</p>
<p>He could feel his head pounding with pain and he smelled blood. “That  was quite a fall you took. You knocked out one of our guards  patrolling the tunnel. You’ve caused a bit of trouble for us.”  Everything came into focus.</p>
<p>“Where am I?” He  asked and suddenly became well aware of the fact that his arms and  legs were shackled.</p>
<p>“I assume you’re  where you wanted to be. No one comes down here without looking for  something. Tell me, what is it that you wanted to find?”</p>
<p>That  voice. That was the voice on the transmission. He willed himself to  look up at her. She was a tall brunette, wearing very business like  clothes. She wore a violet jacket and skirt, a white shirt underneath  and a red tie. Her hair was almost shoulder length and her eyes, also  purple, sparkled with amusement. The woman couldn’t have been more  than thirty.</p>
<p>“Why should I tell  you?” Squall spat.</p>
<p>“Hm. No matter, your  friends will be looking for you soon. It’s only a matter of time  anyway.” She replied, walking towards the door of the cell.</p>
<p>Squall  clenched his fists and had a mind to try and break free of the  shackles one way or another. He wanted to wrap his hands around the  woman’s neck but he was too weak.</p>
<p>“One more thing.”  She replied, turning her head sideways to get a good look at him. “Do  you know a Xu Shen?” Squall said nothing but his eyes betrayed  recognition. The woman smiled.</p>
<p>“I thought so. Have  two guards outside these doors at all times. Prepare for a breach at  anytime. We’re dealing with high caliber SeeD here, not fresh out  of the pond graduates.” She ordered and the door closed behind her.</p>
