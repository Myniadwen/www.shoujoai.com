&quot;So what the hell do you think happened?&quot; Zell said quietly as he poked 
their campfire with a stick. They&#39;d been trapped on the island for more 
than

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Squall whispered and rubbed his temples.

They&#39;d found shelter in a small cave, it wasn&#39;t much but it would keep 
them safe. Most of the really dangerous creatures were far too big to 
follow them down here.

&quot;We&#39;re doomed.&quot; Zell shook his head. &quot;Aw man Nicole...&quot; He sighed.

Squall said nothing, what could he say. Zell was probably right they 
could last for a while but the odds were stacked against them in this 
place. It been little over a day since the Ragnarok vanished and things 
were looking grim.

&quot;No.&quot; Squall muttered grimly.

&quot;What?&quot; Zell sighed.

&quot;We&#39;re not dying here.&quot; Squall scowled. &quot;I deny it.&quot;

&quot;Hey man I didn&#39;t mean nothing, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll think of something. 
They&#39;ll come looking for us.&quot;

&quot;They don&#39;t know where we went.&quot; Squall frowned.

&quot;We should have told someone. It&#39;s my fault man, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;To late to worry about that now.&quot;

&quot;They can track the Ragnarok.&quot; Zell piped up.

&quot;Little good that does us if we&#39;re not on it.&quot;

&quot;Damn it!&quot; Zell kicked out at the fire in a fit of rage and 
helplessness.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe we didn&#39;t bring a COM or nothing. I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d 
be gone that long.&quot; He hopped up and paced about madly.

&quot;Calm down.&quot; Squall said evenly as he stomped out the stray embers 
Zell&#39;s tantrum scattered.

&quot;Calm down?!&quot; Zell rolled his eyes and plopped down heavily by the fire.

&quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;What are going to do Squall? This is bad man, real bad.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m working on it, get some sleep, I&#39;ll take watch.&quot;

&quot;Sleep, in this place!?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

Zell pulled off his coat and folded it up to make a pillow.

&quot;Yeah okay, whatever.&quot; He sighed before lying down.

Squall sat quietly tending the fire and watching over his friend has he 
slept. In the darkness that surrounded them, things as old as time and 
more terrible than any man could imagine, stalked the night.

*************

&quot;So what happened to you guys?&quot; Xu asked, sipping a cup of coffee. She 
looked somewhat haggard and her hair was tossed together haphazardly. 
Quistis didn&#39;t look much better; she barely had time to get back to 
Balamb and shower before she had show up for work. She now took the time 
to sit down in the teachers&#39; lounge for several cups of coffee.

&quot;Fu and I needed some time alone, she ran into some of Seifer&#39;s friends 
or something, it really upset her.&quot;

&quot;Fu?&quot; Xu giggled at the pet name.

&quot;Sorry for leaving unannounced.&quot; Quistis mumbled sheepishly.

&quot;No worries, I figured it was something like that. How&#39;s she doing?&quot;

&quot;Oh she&#39;s fine. She&#39;ll probably fall asleep in class again though.&quot;

&quot;Again?&quot;

Quistis laughed.

&quot;She has a notorious habit of doing that. She knows the course backwards 
and forwards. The poor things bored to tears.&quot;

&quot;To bad, rules are rules. She&#39;ll have to tough it out.&quot; Xu responded 
smartly.

&quot;I know, I know. Don&#39;t worry I had her stand in the hall the other 
morning because she dozed off.&quot;

It was Xu&#39;s turn to laugh.

&quot;Nice to see you aren&#39;t giving her special treatment.&quot;

&quot;Not at all. I dare say I&#39;m harder on her.&quot;

&quot;Well that&#146;s hardly fair.&quot; Xu smirked.

&quot;Nah I think she likes the attention.&quot;

&quot;Un Huh I bet.&quot;

Quistis chuckled and yawned.

&quot;Oh by the way.&quot; Xu frowned pointed accusingly at her.

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis straightened.

&quot;Remember what we talked about in the bathroom.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;About keeping this under wraps for awhile.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Quistis said slowly.

&quot;What heck was that out front of the Opera house.

Quistis blushed.

&quot;Sorry I couldn&#39;t help it.&quot;

&quot;With that and you guys running off.&quot; Xu sighed and shook her head. 
&quot;Your lucky that Nida, bless his little heart, isn&#39;t the most observant 
person in the world when in comes to people.&quot;

&quot;I said I was sorry.&quot; Quistis murmured quietly before taking another sip 
of coffee.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, it was fun.&quot; Xu smiled. &quot;Come on time to go to work.&quot; She 
stood and pulled Quistis to her feet.

***********

Fujin sat outside the door to Quistis&#39;s class, she&#39;d been there for 
nearly thirty minutes. Yawning greatly she wanted nothing more than to 
just curl up somewhere dark and warm and go to sleep. She didn&#39;t even 
notice she&#39;d started to drift off when Aeka appeared in front of her.

&quot;Morning Miss Fujin!&quot; The girl sang breezily.

Fujin opened her eye and gazed darkly at the girl. Aeka giggled and 
stepped back.

&quot;Yikes, looks like you had a long night. Did you go to the party to last 
night? I didn&#39;t see you there. Well I went to bed early so maybe I 
missed you.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin clarified.

&quot;Oh, well hmm. You should have been there, it was a fun!&quot;

&quot; DOUBTFUL.&quot;

Aeka&#39;s cheery expression dimmed slightly.

&quot;I see you&#39;re in a mood.&quot;

&quot;ALWAYS.&quot;

Aeka didn&#39;t quite know if Fujin was joking or was just being bitchy. 
Deciding to leave well enough alone she dug about in her backpack 
looking for her homework. The other students slowly started to arrive 
and soon half the class stood at the door waiting for Quistis to arrive. 
Fujin was just beginning to worry that Quistis had fallen asleep 
somewhere when she saw her walking up the hall.

&quot;Morning class.&quot; Quistis said with a somewhat slovenly tone.

&quot;Hey Miss Trepe.&quot; Royce said merrily and took her bag. &quot;You look a 
little under the weather I&#39;ll take that for ya.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Royce.&quot; Quistis smiled thinly as she fumbled with the keys to 
the classroom. Aeka soured slightly at the exchange, her hopes that she 
and Royce would grow closer where dimming and his crush on Quistis was 
not helping matters. She sighed and waited quietly for Quistis to open 
the door.

Everyone sat down and Quistis went to the chalkboard and started 
scribbling apparent gibberish.

&quot;Okay Class today we&#39;ll be learning about the Centra and their 
civilization and their ties with Guardian Forces.&quot; Quistis began, she 
had a lot to cover today and she prayed for the strength to keep focused 
enough to get through the class. She glanced at Fujin who was already 
looking to fall asleep at any moment. Quistis smiled inwardly, she 
really didn&#39;t want to have to make Fujin stand in the hall again.

***********

Irvine sat on the couch sulking bitterly. Selphie had said little to him 
since yesterday. He wasn&#39;t sure what he could have possibly done but he 
had the distinct impression he was in trouble. He tried to ask her what 
was wrong and she started crying and ran to their room. He&#39;d slept on 
the couch and now pondered what to do. With a heavy sigh and a heavy 
heart he walked to the bedroom door. His conversation with Edea kept 
popping up in the back of his mind and he couldn&#39;t help but worry.

&quot;Selph?&quot; He said gently with a soft knock on the bedroom door.

&quot;No now please..&quot; Selphie mumbled her voice nearly inaudible.

She&#39;d been acting downright strange for the last few weeks and Irvine 
was almost to the breaking point.

&quot;Selphie, what&#39;s wrong, talk to me?&quot; He pleaded.

&quot;Nothing, I just feel under the weather.&quot; She said, this time clearer.

&quot;You sure?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;I tried to find you all day yesterday and couldn&#39;t find you. Anything 
you want to talk about?&quot;

&quot;I was with Quistis.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#146;s good, you two making up then?&quot;

&quot;Yeah we&#39;re cool.&quot;

&quot;Fujin too?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;You know, I learned something yesterday.&quot;

Selphie didn&#39;t answer, Irvine knew she could here him and knew she just 
wanted him to go away. He also knew that no matter what was wrong she 
didn&#39;t need to be alone.

&quot;I talked to Fujin. She told me about what happened during the time we 
we&#39;re in the missile base.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re just trying to make me mad so I&#39;ll come out.&quot; Selphie snapped 
accusingly.

&quot;No, but I wish you would. I miss you.&quot; He sighed. Silence answered him 
and he just continued.

&quot;Anyway, she told me she and Raijin both were here during the attack on 
Trabia. I think we&#39;ve been being unfair.&quot; He pressed his head against 
the door. It seemed as though everything was going wrong lately.

&quot;I think we need to go talk to Quistis about it. I am betting she 
doesn&#146;t know either. Who knows perhaps you and Fujin can talk things 
out.&quot;

The door opened. Selphie stood staring up at him her eyes swollen and 
red, she&#39;d been crying all night by the looks of it.

&quot;Happy, I&#39;ve come out, you can leave me alone.&quot; She said harshly.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong Selph? This isn&#39;t like you. You used to be so bright and 
cheerful, now though...It&#39;s like I don&#39;t even know you.&quot; Irvine said 
sadly.

&quot;A bunch of things, take your pick.&quot; She sniffed.

He kneeled to look her in the face.

&quot;Talk to me about it, let me help.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve done enough.&quot; She laughed bitterly.

&quot;That&#146;s not fair, you&#39;re mad at me for something I&#39;m not even aware of.&quot;

Her features softened.

&quot;I&#39;m not mad at you.&quot; She smiled sadly.

&quot;Then what&#39;s is wrong.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about it right now.&quot;

&quot;Fine then, I&#39;ll respect that for now. I&#39;ll settle on you trying to 
cheer up.&quot;

&quot;Cheery is hard right now. So you talked to Fujin huh.&quot; She frowned.

&quot;Yes, she had nothing to do with Trabia hon. You&#39;ve been angry at her 
for nothing.&quot; He said regretfully.

&quot;I know.&quot; She said simply and moved past him.

&quot;What?&quot; He said darkly.

&quot;I know.&quot; She repeated and made her way into the kitchen.

&quot;Know what exactly.&quot; He prodded as he followed her.

&quot;Look.&quot; She started angrily the sighed. &quot;I knew she was here, Squall 
told me.&quot;

&quot;Squall?&quot;

&quot;Yeah he, Rinoa and Zell ran into Fujin and her brother during the Norg 
riot.&quot;

&quot;Then why.&quot;

&quot;I have reasons.&quot; Selphie scowled and opened the refrigerator. She 
looked about for something appealing. Finding nothing she shut the door 
in disgust.

&quot;Reasons, what reasons. Selphie this isn&#39;t like you at all.&quot;

&quot;Because I need to!&quot; She snapped angrily at him, her small frame 
trembling.

&quot;Selph.&quot; Irvine sighed sadly and rubbed his face in distress.

&quot;It&#39;s all I have, it&#39;s all I can do.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot;

&quot;Of course not.&quot; She squeezed past him and headed back to the bedroom. 
He moved past her and barred the door with his arm.

&quot;I&#39;m not letting you go and lock yourself into some kind of depression.&quot;

She laughed lightly and ducked under his arm.

&quot;Honestly, I&#39;m not depressed I&#39;m just not feeling well. As for 
Fujin....&quot; She trailed off. She hated what her inability to move on had 
turned her into. Thinking back on how&#39;d she been acting, how she&#39;d 
treated everyone. She&#39;d like to blame her volatile temper of late on the 
pregnancy, but she knew better. The events at Trabia had left long 
lasting scars on her and Fujin&#39;s very presence reminded her of the loss 
she endured.

&quot;It&#39;s because of Edea and Seifer.&quot; She finally said after a long pause. 
Her voice was cold and emotionless.

&quot;What?&quot; Irvine said quietly and kneeled before her.

&quot;I hate them.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;They killed my friends, some of them where 
like family to me.&quot;

&quot;I know Selph but Fujin had no part of it.&quot; Irvine placed gentle hands 
on her shoulders.

&quot;Edea..I tell myself, that Ultimecia possessed her. I&#39;ve come to live 
with that. Then there&#39;s Seifer. He had a choice. He knew what was right 
or wrong. He tortured Squall for Hyne&#39;s sake.&quot; Selphie shook her head 
feeling lost. &quot;He led the Galbadia troops against Balamb, his home. He 
destroyed Trabia, took countless lives, then we let him go.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s more complicated than that.&quot; Irvine tried.

Selphie slapped him.

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare defend him.&quot; She said with a frightening intensity.

Irvine didn&#39;t flinch, or get angry, he wanted to understand.

&quot;But Seifer&#39;s gone.&quot; He said quietly.

&quot;I know.&quot; She sighed wearily and hugged him sadly.

&quot;Selph.&quot; Irvine wrapped his arms around her.

&quot;They died for nothing and no one was punished. I need this; it&#39;s all I 
can do for them. I can never forgive him. I have to hate him.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not Seifer love.&quot;

&quot;I know, but she loves him. She&#39;s close to him; she&#39;s part of him. When 
I see her all I see is him.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know much about her but I know this much. Quistis trusts her, 
she hasn&#39;t even mentioned Seifer to anyone and she is trying to fit in.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t want to hear it.&quot; Selphie grumbled and buried her head against 
his chest.

&quot;You&#39;ve got to let this go Selph, it&#39;s tearing you apart.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not fair.&quot; She murmured softly, as the tears began to flow. &quot;I 
can&#39;t let them be forgotten.&quot;

&quot;Then don&#39;t, but don&#39;t remember them by hating and cursing their deaths. 
Remember them for the joy and love they brought you. If you want to hate 
Seifer for what he did. You go ahead and do so, no one can fault you for 
that. Fujin though, I&#39;m fairly certain that poor girl was used and hurt 
by him as much as anyone. If anything you two have something in common 
in that.&quot;

Selphie sniffled and shrugged.

&quot;I&#39;m pregnant.&quot; She said quietly.

*****************

&quot;I THOUGHT YOU KNEW HOW TO FLY!&quot; Archibald bellowed from his seat at the 
back of the bridge. The Ragnarok tossed about in the air as if in a 
thunderstorm.

&quot;I don&#146;t know what&#39;s wrong with it!&quot; Luccian snapped as he struggled 
with the controls.&quot;

&quot;Cripes man put it on auto pilot then!&quot;

&quot;That only makes it worse, now shut up!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re going to get us killed I know it!&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot;

&quot;Land man before it&#39;s to late!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re okay, trust me, we&#39;re still on course, all the instruments read 
green.&quot;

&quot;BULLSHIT!&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s just turbulence.&quot;

&quot;How the hell do you know!&quot;

&quot;What else could it be.&quot;

&quot;Us plummeting to our deaths sounds like a likely answer!&quot;

&quot;Just, just shut up!&quot; Luccian threw Squall&#39;s duffel bag at him.

&quot;We&#39;re gonna die and it&#39;s your damn fault.&quot;

&quot;We are not, quit acting like a baby.&quot;

Abruptly the craft leveled and all was quite. Luccian and Archibald 
looked around cautiously.

&quot;HA! See I told you.&quot; Luccian chuckled with pride.

&quot;Just get us on the ground.&quot; Archibald hissed.

&quot;In time, we&#39;ll be there in a few hours. Did you finish disabling the 
homing beacon, last thing we need is Balamb tracking us.&quot;

&quot;I beat the hell out of it with my staff if that&#146;s what you meant.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re such a friggin caveman.&quot;

&quot;I did the job quit being a bitch.&quot;

There was a loud ringing.

&quot;What the hell?&quot; Archibald looked about.

&quot;Calm down, it&#39;s just my COM.&quot; Luccian assured him while slipping the 
small phone from his pocket and answered it.

&quot;Hello? Oh I hi sir. Yeah everything&#39;s okay. My father? No change 
really. To be honest I haven&#39;t even spoken to him. Yeah I know. Who? 
Squall, and Zell? They left here a few days ago. I don&#39;t know where they 
went. Oh they&#39;ll pop up, surely they can handle themselves. I sure will. 
Yes Sir, thank you Sir, goodbye.&quot;

Luccian hung up and stuffed the communicator back in his pocket.

&quot;Who the hell was that?&quot; Archibald asked curiously.

&quot;Headmaster Cid. He&#39;s looking for Squall and Zell.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;d he know you COM number?&quot;

Luccian laughed.

&quot;I had a friend back home wire all my calls through the company 
satellite. He&#39;s also covering for me if anyone comes looking for us. The 
official story is that we&#39;re taking a trip the check out factories in 
the far lands.&quot;

&quot;You put a lot of thought into this.&quot; Archibald said genuinely 
impressed.

&quot;I&#39;m no fool, it&#39;s about time you learned that.&quot;

Archibald scoffed and settled back in his seat.

&quot;I feel kinda bad man.&quot;

&quot;You smell kinda bad.&quot; Luccian laughed, impressed by his own wit.

&quot;I&#39;m serious man, we left those guys on the Island of Hell, what if they 
get killed man, it&#39;ll be our fault.&quot;

&quot;If I know anything it&#39;s that Squall and your boy Zell can take care of 
anything that island can throw at em.&quot;

&quot;Yeah but for how long, man.&quot;

&quot;Look as soon as we get this last key and find out where the temple is 
I&#39;ll wipe the computers of our trip and send the Ragnarok back on auto 
pilot. If you&#39;re really worried, I&#39;ll have someone leave an anonymous 
tip.&quot;

&quot;This is a bad idea.&quot;

&quot;To late to be backing out now, your in this for the long haul so tough 
it out.&quot;

&quot;Yeah whatever.&quot; Archibald grumbled sourly before retiring to the bunks 
stowed in the lower areas of the ship.

*******************

&quot;ANGRY.&quot; Fujin said with a hint of hurt as she worked shampoo into 
Quistis&#39;s hair.

&quot;Sorry hon I warned you.&quot; Quistis giggled as she wrung out a large 
sponge.

&quot;UNFAIR.&quot; Fujin pouted.

Quistis let the shower soak her thoroughly trying not to giggle at 
Fujin&#39;s attempt at a guilt trip.

&quot;You fell asleep in class, you know the rules.&quot; She chided as she rinsed 
her hair.

&quot;HUMPF.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t sulk it&#39;s not becoming.&quot; Quistis winked candidly over her 
shoulder.

Fujin wrapped soapy arms around her and chuckled.

&quot;Ack you&#39;re cold.&quot; Quistis squealed.

&quot;YOUR FAULT, HOG WATER.&quot;

Quistis wiggled loose and tossed the sponge at her. Fujin sputtered 
cutely but was happy to have some hot water. With a laugh Quistis 
stepped out of the shower and dried off. She walked into her bedroom and 
was overwhelmed. The heater was blowing full blast and the humidity was 
nearly overwhelming. She hurried to the thermostat and toyed with it to 
no avail.

&quot;Damn it.&quot; She cursed angrily.

&quot;PROBLEM.&quot; Fujin asked curiously as she stepped into the room drying her 
hair and wrapped in a towel. Quistis giggled at her, she loved the way 
Fujin&#39;s ears stuck out slightly from her head. It was very noticeable 
when her hair was wet and it made her look like some sort of snow fairy. 
Fujin knew what she was grinning at and touched her ears and blushed 
self-consciously.

Quistis pointed to the thermostat in disgust.

&quot;It&#39;s busted.&quot;

&quot;TURN OFF?&quot;
&quot;I tried, it&#39;s stuck on high.&quot;

&quot;MY PLACE.&quot; Fujin yawned.

&quot;Sure, that works for me, you place is cozy and we don&#39;t have to worry 
about people knocking on the door all night. I want to get some sleep.&quot;

Fujin nodded in agreement. They got dressed and made their way to 
Fujin&#39;s quarters. As they entered the hall several students stood 
talking and cursing. All wore shorts and were sweating.

&quot;Miss Trepe?&quot; One of the students called to her.

&quot;Yes?&quot; She answered while looking about in wonder.

&quot;Any idea what&#39;s with heaters?&quot; The young man asked his hair a sopping 
mop atop his head.

&quot;Sorry I have no idea. I&#39;m sure Cid has maintenance working on it.&quot;

&quot;They need to hurry, this sucks.&quot; He grumbled.

Quistis smiled helplessly.

&quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be up as soon as possible.

**************

Deep in the bowels of Balamb Garden a lone figure sat on the floor amid 
a sea of wires and piping. The only light was that of his small headlamp 
and the dull red glow from the antenna on his radio. His name was Glenn, 
short fellow with a salt and peppered beard and curly hair. While busily 
spliced wires with his callused hands and stumpy fingers, the radio 
played quiet tunes. Humming along he was oblivious to his surroundings. 
Not that he was worried though, he knew nearly every twist, turn, vent 
and crawlspace that formed a labyrinth under the school. Cid had called 
him just moments ago.

&quot;Glenn&quot; He had said. &quot;Something&#39;s wrong with the heaters, see if you fix 
it?&#39;

Glenn had been working here since he was a student. He loved the place, 
it was his home and he made it his job to keep it in tiptop shape. He 
was single and had no family and his only real friends where a few 
drinking buddies on the maintenance staff.

So here he sat; something had ripped the wires loose from the control 
box on the heating systems computer. Now he knew various creatures had 
roamed down here at times so he was prepared, he was no slouch in combat 
and carried a large handgun in his dark blue work suit. He finally 
fitted the wires back in place and turned the system back on. He ran a 
diagnostic and everything checked out. With a prideful smile he turned 
to leave. He wasn&#39;t sure what it was when he saw it. A fleshy mass, 
jelly like, but solid in parts, fleshy, but also mechanical. It looked 
as though someone had crammed a jellyfish full of scrap from a junkyard.

The alien appearance of it assaulted his mind to the degree that he 
couldn&#146;t comprehend it enough to be afraid. The fear came though, with 
startling speed, but by then it was far to late for Glenn. Long oily 
black tendrils laced with wires and steel mesh wrapped around his skull, 
immediately the flesh began to dissolve and the last sound Glenn made 
was hollow sucking sound. The creature pulled itself to him and burst 
open at the middle to engulf him fully. Tentacles of wire and muscle 
entwined around his still twitching form, even while flesh and bone 
melted under its embrace. Within moments all that remain of Glenn was 
the radio playing it&#39;s happy tune in the darkness.

***************

Rinoa sat in the open window of Nicole and Zell&#39;s apartment fanning 
herself in a failing attempt to keep cool. Nicole sat gloomily in the 
floor with Celest by her side devouring a box of ice cream with 
downright vulgar enthusiasm.

&quot;That&#146;s disgusting, slow down.&quot; Rinoa chuckled.

&quot;I&#39;m worried, I eat when I&#39;m worried.&quot; Celest grumbled.

&quot;Why are you worried? Your boyfriends aren&#39;t out who knows where. Doing 
Hyne knows what.&quot; Nicole said bitterly.

&quot;What? I&#39;m not allowed to worry, you guys are my friends after all?&quot; 
Celest said looking hurt.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Nicole started but Celest stuffed a spoonful of ice-cream 
in her mouth to silence her.

&quot;Don&#39;t apologize silly. I&#39;m just glad you said something. You&#39;ve been 
quiet all night.&quot; Celest giggled. Rinoa smirked and looked out the 
window.

&quot;You two.&quot; She chuckled. &quot;Nikki, I talked to Cid earlier today, he said 
he&#39;d check around and see if they can&#39;t find them. I think I know what&#39;s 
up, I wouldn&#39;t worry.&quot;

&quot;I wish I had your confidence.&quot; Nicole frowned.

&quot;Well Noa spill the beans, seems you have yourself a idea.&quot; Celest 
asked.

&quot;Your birthday&#39;s tomorrow.&quot; Rinoa grinned at Nicole slyly. &quot;I am willing 
to bet they went somewhere you get something special.&quot;

&quot;Hey good call.&quot; Celest nodded vigorously. &quot;That must be it.&quot;

Nicole actual smiled hopefully.

&quot;You think so, that does make sense.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m willing to bet on it.&quot; Rinoa smiled hugely.

&quot;Where&#39;s Selphie, I haven&#39;t seen her all day?&quot; Celest asked aloud, not 
that she cared particularly but the small girl was usually part of these 
impromptu gatherings.

&quot;She&#39;s still under the weather.&quot; Nicole added mildly. &quot;I saw her and 
Quistis heading to see the doc yesterday.&quot;

&quot;Quistis?&quot; Rinoa arched a worried brow. &quot;She okay, why was she going 
too?&quot;

&quot;Oh I think Quistis was just making sure Selphie went, Quisty was 
carrying Selphie her over her shoulder.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re joking.&quot; Celest laughed.

&quot;Nope.&quot; Nicole grinned.

&quot;That&#146;s just odd.&quot; Rinoa pursed her lips thoughtfully. &quot;I hope they&#39;re 
okay.&quot;

&quot;Want to go check on them?&quot; Celest offered, hoping Rinoa would put aside 
her and Quistis&#39;s unspoken rift.

&quot;Yeah lets go.&quot; Rinoa said eagerly and shut the window.

&quot;I could use some air anyway.&quot; Nicole added.

The trio got their shoes and soon headed out the door.

***************

Squall, unable to sleep, let Zell sleep through his watch. With all his 
thinking he was still clueless how he was going to get them off the 
island.

&quot;GONE! SHE IS GONE!&quot; A voice screamed in the darkness. A mans voice, 
guttural and tinged with madness. Zell sat bolt upright startled awake.

&quot;What the hell was that!?&quot; He shouted clamoring to his feet.

Squall was already on his feet. It was already dawn outside but the 
cavern they&#39;d chosen to camp in was black as pitch. The only light came 
from the meager fire they had used to cook dinner.

Squall shushed him and stared of in the darkness. The sound of falling 
stones and scurrying feet echoed in the back of the cavern.

&quot;Thieves, miscreants, fools the lady is death to all! You have no idea 
what you seek to free!&quot; The voice screamed again, this time much closer.

&quot;Who?&quot; Zell mouthed his eyes wide trying to see in the darkness.

Squall shrugged and drew his Gunblade as the light of torch appeared in 
the darkness. A figure was charging them a howl upon his lips and cloak 
billowing in the air like some apparition.

&quot;Ah hell is it undead!?&quot; Zell paled and took a fighting stance.

&quot;Fools, idiots, may she curse your eyes and steal your breath!&quot; The 
figure roared and charged into the campsite wielding a torch like sword.

&quot;Gah it&#39;s some nutcase!&quot; Zell yelped and ducked as the figure swung the 
torch at him. Squall rushed forward and brought the flat of the blade 
down hard. He had meant to strike the madman unconscious but to his 
surprise the figure countered his move and deftly kicked him in the 
stomach. Squall exhaled sharply and nearly dropped his blade.

&quot;Squall!&quot; Zell shouted and charged their opponent. The figure spun to 
face him and stabbed with the torch. Zell, having been practicing 
fighting armed opponents, was ready and snatched the torch from his 
hands. He grimaced in pain as his fingers smoldered and his sleeve 
caught on fire but at least he&#39;d disarmed his foe. His foe was stunned 
by the move and Zell took the opportunity to try and land a blow to 
figures hooded head with a palm strike.

&quot;Madness, you are all insane.&quot; The stranger yelled and quickly lowered 
his head. Zell struck the top of the figure on the top of the skull and 
it was like hitting a wall.

&quot;DAMN IT.&quot; Zell shouted and hopped back rubbing his wrist.

&quot;HA!&quot; The figure shouted and lowered his hood. The man was filthy and 
his dark green eyes glimmered with keen intelligence. He wore a long and 
matted beard well past his chest. His long hair was so fouled one could 
hardly see the blond color of it. The man smiled a gleaming smile and 
stared at him with unknown intent. Zell shook of the throbbing in his 
hand and looked to Squall who was already moving to attack if need be.

&quot;Who the hell are you!&quot; Squall said dangerously.

&quot;I should ask the same, but know already, you idiots come here seeking 
her. Return before she awakens the nameless.&quot;

Zell looked cautiously to Squall hoping he could explain. Squall 
shrugged, he was just as clueless.

&quot;Clean, bah know nothing smell of man, food for the wicked. Like flies 
you draw them with the promise of ease.&quot; The man babbled again.

&quot;Look we&#39;re just camping out man, if this is your spot you can have it. 
All I know is that if you charge us again we aren&#39;t going be responsible 
for what happens.&quot;

The man cackled and looked around wildly.

&quot;Wuss as before and remains.&quot; The man laughed.

Squall went cold and dropped his blade.

&quot;Seifer!?&quot;
