<p align="center">Confused and Rushed</p>
<p>Quistis ran as if her life depended on  it. She couldn’t believe she had just done that. What would Xu think now? She  shouldn’t have done it. Now she might’ve just lost her best friend over some  trivial feelings. She ran a short distance down the road before turning around  and running back towards the house. But instead, she kept going until the cliff  neared. She had made up her mind. She wasn’t going to live any longer. Her feet  kept going, even though part of her mind screamed at her to stop. No more pain,  no more hurting, just darkness. Just as she was within feet of the cliff,  something tackled her from behind and she fell just short of the fall. She  turned around and saw Xu, holding her firmly around the waist.</p>
<p>“Xu?” She whispered. Xu didn’t let  go. Instead, she buried her head into Quistis’s back, suppressing the urge to  cry.</p>
<p>“Don’t you EVER do that! We care too  much for you. I swear, Quistis, please, don’t ever do that. We love you, I love  you.” She yelled, looking up at her finally. Quistis pulled out of her grasp  and drew her knees up to her face.</p>
<p>“Xu…I’m sorry.” Xu brushed her hair  out of the way before cupping both sides of her face, forcing her to look at  her. But look was not all she did. She leaned in and gave Quistis the kiss  filled with passion that their first one lacked. And Quistis returned for  another. When they finally parted, they looked at each other in the eyes.</p>
<p>“Promise me, you’ll never leave.” Xu  pleaded.</p>
<p>“Well, with how this relationship  has started, I think I’ll be ok.” She giggled between tears of happiness. Xu placed  her hand on top of Quistis’s. They stared at the ground for a long time, not  saying anything. Quistis relished the comfort but at the same time, didn’t know  what she was feeling.</p>
<p>“I think…” They both began and  stopped.</p>
<p>“You go.” Xu said.</p>
<p>“What do we  do?” She whispered. “Everything’s so mixed up…I can’t tell if what I’m feeling  is love or not. I mean, with the voices and the loneliness…what if all I’m  looking for is comfort and I’m willing to go to anyone. Xu, I don’t want to  hurt you.”</p>
<p>“It’s ok.”  Xu replied softly, looking her in the eyes. Her words were sincere. “If all  you’re looking for is comfort, I don’t mind. I’m not too sure what I feel  either. We can take it slow if you want.” Quistis smiled and hugged her. The  torrent of feelings within Xu only grew and she felt tears slipping past her  eyelids. After a few seconds, they stood up and walked back towards the house.  Xu tentatively slipped her hand into Quistis’s. Quistis looked down, mildly  surprised, and tightened their hold.</p>

“See Spot.  See Spot run.” Selphie read with as much enthusiasm as she could possibly  muster without having to set the book on fire. The children loved that book and  she had been persuaded to read it numerous time…too many times. “See Spot run  across the street.” <em>See Car. See Car and Spot meet.</em> She thought  bitterly. Rinoa appeared in the doorway and waved.
<p>“Miss,  ‘Noa!” The children shouted. Selphie breathed a sigh of relief as the children  scrambled over to her. Rinoa laughed as they held tightly onto her legs and  arms.</p>
<p>“Sorry  kids, I’m just here to steal Selphie away. I can’t play with you now.” She  said. The kids pouted and Selphie silently thanked Hyne. She stood up and set  the book down, following Rinoa out of the room.</p>
<p>“So, what’s  up? Is it…your powers?” She asked, sensing something amiss.</p>
<p>“No, it’s  nothing like that. It’s just that the entire Garden has gotten all tense since  Seifer returned. Squall’s just waiting for an excuse to jump him and lock him  up for good. Seifer’s trying his best not to…”</p>
<p>“Screw  him.” Selphie snapped bluntly. “I’ve got no love for the man and neither should  you.”</p>
<p>“Love for  who?” Seifer appeared behind them from seemingly out of nowhere. Selphie jumped  and by instinct alone, smacked him so hard he went reeling.</p>
<p>“Hyne!”  Rinoa gasped as Seifer stood, stunned by the sudden attack. In a minute though,  he had recovered and was smarting from the blow.</p>
<p>“WHAT WAS  THAT FOR?” He yelled, holding his bloody nose.</p>
<p>“You deserved  it!” Selphie shouted back, a little surprised that something like this would  happen. Seifer cursed and held his nose gently.</p>
<p>“We ought  to go to Dr. Kadowaki for this.” Rinoa suggested it.</p>
<p>“I’m going  by myself! I don’t want tiny terror here jumping me again!” Seifer hissed as he  stormed off. Selphie slapped her forehead. She didn’t mean to do that but just  seeing their former enemy surprise them like that made her reflexes go berserk.  Rinoa stared after him with concern.</p>
<p>Seifer  walked down the hall, not really liking the stares he was getting from the  students. He was so caught up in his pain that he walked right into Irvine.</p>
<p>“Woah  there. What beast got you?” Irvine asked, seeing him hold his bloody nose.  Seifer scowled.</p>
<p>“Beast? It  was a tiny beast in yellow with short brown hair that happens to be dating you.  That’s the beast!” he snapped. Irvine chuckled a little as he kept going,  almost breaking into a run. He’d have to have a talk with her later about  controlling her temper, even if it was Seifer.</p>
<p>If Seifer  was in a bad mood, Squall wasn’t even within the vicinity of anger. He was  beyond it. With what he considered a danger to society running around, he  couldn’t help but worry. He waited patiently by his phone just waiting for it  to ring and give him a good reason to pound Seifer into the ground so hard that  Ultimecia would have to dig him out. Seeing his old rival get off so easily  wounded his pride. He wanted to see the son of a bitch get what he deserved and  with Rinoa siding with Seifer, he couldn’t help but feel just a tad bit  jealous, no matter how loyal he knew she was.</p>
<p>“So,  bossman…” Zell’s spiky head popped in the doorway. “Um…sorry about breaking  protocol and everything…you’re not really going to demote me…are you?”</p>
<p>“No, Zell,  but I will seriously consider it if you don’t leave me alone.” Unfortunately,  all Zell heard was the “no.” He waltzed in, looking around.</p>
<p>“Eh…Squall,  can I ask you something.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Cool, ok,  see, I really like Ayane. I mean, I really, really like Ayane. But I’m not sure  if I should propose just yet. I mean, we’ve only been going out for a year.  Dude, I’m just wondering if you could share some man to man advice.” He put his  hands together. “Please?” Squall groaned and slammed his head against the desk.</p>
<p>“Zell, get  out of here.” He snapped.</p>
<p>“But…bossman…you  gotta help me. I don’t want to lose her because of this.”</p>
<p>“You won’t.  Wait another few years. Now leave!” Zell smiled and gave him the thumbs up and  left.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Qusitis and  Xu sat in the living room, holding hands yet not sure what to do. Both were  still very awkward in this type of situation, neither having been in such a  relationship before. But both were determined that this was not going to change  the friendship that they had worked so hard to establish.
<p>“Hey…you  still owe me the Quistis card.” Quistis said, breaking the strained silence. Xu  let out a little sigh of relief and giggled.</p>
<p>“Can’t I  keep it? It’s one of my best cards, and my favorite too.” She teased, making  Quistis blush. Xu felt as if she should stop teasing before it got too  uncomfortable. “So now what do we do?”</p>
<p>“First you  fork over the card.” She snapped. “I’m dead serious.”</p>
<p>“Hey, I  know, let’s call Zell and go get the car…” Xu suggested, trying to take her  mind off of the card. It worked since she leapt to her feet in excitement.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I  forgot all about the presents and the cake!” Xu grimaced, thinking exactly how  bad the cake must’ve gotten. Sitting in the sun baking probably made the cake  all mushy. But Quistis ran over to the phone and called up the Balamb Garden.</p>
<p>“Hello, you  have reached the Balamb Garden Military Academy. If you wish to reach the  headmaster press 1; if you wish to reach the dorms, press 2; if you wish to  reach the all knowing, all powerful, worshiped and loving Squall, savior of us  all, press 3 because Squall is so cool and I wish he would dump Rinoa and date  me because I absolutely love him…” Quistis broke out into laughter. She  reminded herself to tell Squall of the changes this student had made to the voice  machine. She pressed three and a very disgruntled and angry sounding Squall  picked up the phone.</p>
<p>“What?” He  snapped.</p>
<p>“Now that’s  not very nice…” she giggled. “Oh all knowing all powerful, worshiped and loving  Squall.”</p>
<p>“Quistis?  What the heck are you talking about?” He asked. She burst into laughter again.  “Are you ok?”</p>
<p>“Who does  the voice for the school’s phone directory?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Cezzy  Finbrok, why?” He replied. Quistis nodded knowingly.</p>
<p>“Did you  every notice that she was kind of attached to you?”</p>
<p>“No…”  Quistis giggled. That was Squall alright, apart from Rinoa, he had hardly  changed at all.</p>
<p>“Well,  anyway, get Zell on the line will you? We need him to fly the Ragnarok over.”  She replied.</p>
<p>“Why?”  Squall was getting suspicious. Out of the corner of her, eye, she saw Xu  frantically waving her hands, trying to get Quistis not to tell her secret any  sooner than she had to. Quistis gave her a smile. No point in holding back.</p>
<p>“She  destroyed your car.”</p>
<p>A young  SeeD named Walter walked towards Squall’s office. He had always been a little  nervous of the intimidating Commander. But he had to give his report for the  number of SeeDs they were currently training. <em>Don’t panic…he’s not that bad…</em>he  thought.</p>
<p>“I TOLD HER  NOT TO WRECK IT! I’M GOING TO KILL HER WHEN SHE GETS BACK! HECK I’LL KILL  SOMEONE RIGHT NOW!” Squall’s voice echoed through the entire Garden. Walter  turned pale and whirled around. He could always give his report another day.</p>
<p>Quistis  hung up after talking to Zell. She collapsed in a fit of giggles while Xu  rested her head in her hands on the couch.</p>
<p>“Why…?” She  asked. “Damn it…” Quistis walked over to her and gave her a kiss on the  forehead and sat down beside her.</p>
<p>“It’s  alright. It had to be done. It was now or later, you know…” She replied. Xu  tackled her onto the couch.</p>
<p>“No, it was  not necessary. And for that I’m going to have to punish you.” She hissed  dangerously. Quistis raised an eyebrow suggestively and Xu smirked. “No human  contact for the rest of the week.” Quistis gaped.</p>
<p>“Hey! We  just got together and you’re already rejecting me?” Xu stood up and dusted  herself off. “You won’t last a day without someone to hug or cuddle up to.”</p>
<p>“You are  merely describing yourself.” She replied, walking into the kitchen to get a  glass of water. Quistis balked and crossed her arms. Xu smirked and sat down,  idly flipping through a magazine.</p>
<p>“Zell ought  to be here in about an hour…maybe less depending on if he decides to obey the  speed limit.” Xu said which only served to make Quistis pout even more. “If  you’re up to that challenge…” Quistis ignored her and Xu let out a chuckle.</p>
<p>A half an  hour passed, then forty-five minutes. Quistis knew she couldn’t stand letting  precious time slip through her fingers. She decided to give up. She walked over  to Xu and sat down on her lap, facing her.</p>
<p>“You lost.”  Xu stated calmly, placing the magazine down. She looked her full in the eyes  and a shudder ran up her spine.</p>
<p>“I don’t  care.” Quistis replied with startling intensity. Both their hearts beating  fast, they leaned in for what promised to be the most passionate kiss yet…and  they still had fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>“YO! MISS  TREPE!” A loud voice shouted from the window. Quistis fumbled back in an effort  to distance herself before they were caught.</p>
<p>“Damn  it…I’m going to wring his neck!” Xu snapped, storming over to the door. “What  do you want?” Zell backed away for a moment.</p>
<p>“Er…you  called?” He tried pathetically. Xu groaned and slapped her forehead. Quistis  made her way over to the door. “Miss Trepe…she’s scaring me…” he said in a  childish voice. Xu glared at him and he stuck his tongue out.</p>
<p>“You’re  early, aren’t you, Zell?” Quistis said, trying to change the subject. Zell let  out a goofy smirk.</p>
<p>“Yeah…I was  so excited to see you that I couldn’t help going over the speed limit. Besides,  it’s not like anyone really checks…” He replied.</p>
<p>“Don’t let  Ayane hear that. She’ll get really jealous and you know what happens when she  gets jealous…” Quistis warned. Zell gulped and rubbed the back of his head.</p>
<p>“Um…so…shall  we get going?” He asked.</p>
<p>“Is Selphie  there?” She asked.</p>
<p>“Nope. She  and Irvine went to go spend some ‘quality time’ together.” He said, turning red  slightly. “I didn’t tell her either. She would’ve hogged my little baby all to herself…”  Quistis raised an eyebrow when he said “my little baby” and hugged his arms. Xu  stormed over to the Ragnarok.</p>
<p>“Hurry up  then! The sooner we get there the sooner we get back.” She yelled. Zell cringed  and looked at his Instructor.</p>
<p>“What’s  with her?” he asked. Quistis waved her hand and sighed.</p>
<p>“It’s  nothing. She’s just a little upset that you interrupted something she was  doing.” She replied. Xu tapped her foot impatiently and waited as the two took  their time while Zell filled Quistis on what had gone on in the past day. She  couldn’t help but feel a little angry with him for interrupting such a precious  moment. They took the elevator to the cockpit and buckled up.</p>
<p>“What’s  Seifer been up to lately?” Quistis asked. Xu flinched at the mention of his  name. She wasn’t all too fond of the man.</p>
<p>“Well,  Selphie broke his nose…it was an accident and Squall was yelling about killing  someone…weird…and we’ve all really missed you because a certain old hag hogged  you all to herself.” He eyed Xu with contempt.</p>
<p>“Quistis  would much rather spend her time with me, wouldn’t you, Quisty?” Xu said,  throwing a pleading look her way. She smiled and shook her head as Zell took  off. Unfortunately for Xu, she hadn’t been in an aircraft with an angry Zell  before and she was thrown back against the seat.</p>
<p>“ZELL!”  She made a move to strangle him but Quistis stopped her.</p>
<p>“I’ll  reward you later if you be a good girl…” She whispered. Xu sat quietly, looking  as innocent as possible while Zell wondered exactly why he wasn’t bruised/wounded/dead  yet.</p>
<p>The car was  still baking in the sun but the cake was miraculously still in tact. It hadn’t  melted because it had been resting under the seat in the shade. Quistis and Xu  loaded the Ragnarok with her gifts and Zell hopped up and down like an over  excited child.</p>
<p>“You gunna  open them up now? Huh?” He asked, getting in Quistis’s way. “You’ll love my  present, guaranteed!”</p>
<p>“Just  drive.” Xu snapped before looking worriedly at Quistis, hoping that her  momentary forgetfulness hadn’t cost her the “reward.” Lucky for her, Quistis  was too busy trying to carry all the boxes. Much to Zell’s disappointment, the  minute they got back to the house, Xu slammed the door in his face and told him  to go home.</p>
<p>“Aw!  That’s so unfair!” he whined outside like a puppy. When he realized that no one  was paying attention, he gave up and decided to go back to someone who would  care, Ayane.</p>
<p>“So, now  that he’s gone,” Xu said, peeking through the window. “Do I get my reward?” She  turned around only to see Quistis sitting on the floor crosslegged, opening her  presents.</p>
<p>“You’ll get  it later, I promise.” She replied. Xu huffed and slumped down next to her.  “This is from Squall and Rinoa?” She picked up an elaborately wrapped medium  sized gift with flower wrapping and a clear blue ribbon. She opened the card  first and read it, smiling and shaking her head.</p>
<p>“What does  it say?” Xu asked, coming up behind her and wrapping her arms around her neck.</p>
<p>“ ‘Quistis:  Happy birthday! We all love you so very much, even Squall but he’s too shy to  admit it, right Squally-poo? Well anyway, the gift is something that Squall  said you would like but I told him that something…cuter would do. So in a  nutshell, he got you the gift, not me…</p>
<p>Love always, Rinoa and Squall’”</p>
<p>Quistis unwrapped the gift gently,  folding the wrapping paper and putting it aside. It was the latest model of the  Save the Queen. It was a black with red flames whip with a sharp end. She stood  up and swung it to test it out.</p>
<p>“Wow, this  must’ve cost a lot. But it makes me wonder…what else could this be used for…”  Quistis cast a sideways glance at Xu and she blushed.</p>
<p>“Get you  mind out of the gutter.” She said, looking at the ground. “Besides, you’ve got  more gifts.” She tossed Quistis two packages bound together and she read the  card.</p>
<p>“ ‘Hey  Quistis! Happy birthday! But I can’t believe you’re not spending it with us.  It’s so not fair, I had everything planned out too! First, morning and noon  shopping, then we go to some fancy restaurant and then we go clubbing! But nooo,  Xu had to snatch you away…anyway, a word of warning. Irvine insisted that he  get a different present and he was all smiles when he came back so…I’m pretty  sure you know what kind of present he got you.- Selphie” She opened the gift  from Selphie and smiled gently. It was a collection of photos from when they  were young to when they had come back after defeating Ultimecia. Xu sat down  beside her.</p>
<p>“Um…do you  actually want to open Irvine’s present or should I just throw it out now?” She  asked.</p>
<p>“I’ll take  my chances.” Quistis replied and unwrapped the gift warily. She groaned when  she saw the contents. “Irvine…” she sighed. Lacy black underwear and bra. Of  course only Irvine would get her such a gift.</p>
<p>“I like  it.” Xu said absently. Quistis eyed her with something akin to disgust and set  it down.</p>
<p>“Ok…on to  the next one…” She picked up a poorly wrapped newspaper covered package.  Scrawled in big black letters on the package was, “Sorry about the wrapping,  Zell completely forgot about your birthday. We hope you have a wonderful  birthday. Hugs and kisses, Ayane and Zell.” Quistis chuckled fondly and  unwrapped it. It was a moomba doll.</p>
<p>“Adorable…”  she whispered. Xu nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“Now for my  reward?” she said.</p>
<p>“What  reward?” Quistis replied, only to be tackled by Xu.</p>
<p>“You  promised!” she whined. Quistis laughed and leaned up, catching her lips. Xu  smiled into the kiss and deepened it.</p>
<p>“I guess I ought  to be better behaved if I get that for a reward,” she laughed, getting off  Quistis. There were still presents from Edea and Cid as well as…the dreaded Trepies.  She winced at the sight of them and mentally prepared herself for what she may  find.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
A frail figure made her  way up to the gates of Balamb. She smiled as she saw the Garden, quite happy  that she was able to make it there. But the message she carried was less happy  and her smile soon vanished from her face.
<p>“Well, time to get on  with it.”</p>
