Quistis&#146; draw dropped and she looked, quite simply, horrified. Irvine 
quickly took note of her reaction and adjusted his statement.

&quot;I mean would you, if say, we were dating?&quot;

&quot;Were not dating.&quot; Quistis said cautiously.

&quot;Humor me. I need a girls opinion.&quot; He said in exasperation.

&quot;Well...&quot; Quistis started slowly, wanting to choose her words carefully. 
&quot;Hmm... I don&#146;t know. What&#146;s all this about? Are you thinking of asking 
Selphie to marry you?&quot;

&quot;We have a kid coming.&quot; Irvine said simply.

&quot;I know that but that still doesn&#146;t answer the question.&quot;

&quot;Are you going to help me or not?&quot;

&quot;Calm down. Why&#146;d you choose me? I figured I&#146;d be the last person 
someone would come to on something like this.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re the most mature of us.&quot; Irvine said as if it was common 
knowledge.

&quot;Thanks, I think.&quot;

&quot;No really, I&#146;m serious. You&#146;ve a way with people and your honest. But 
mostly I trust your judgment.&quot; He said quietly.

Quistis could have laughed.

&quot;Don&#146;t hold me in such regard hon. Hyne knows I&#146;m the farthest thing 
from perfect.&quot; She sighed and looked at him sternly as if searching for 
something.

&quot;You&#146;re nice.&quot; She started slowly and tiled her head to scrutinize him 
further. &quot;Strong, handsome, charming.&quot; She smirked, causing him to beam 
slightly.

&quot;Well I am aren&#146;t I.&quot; He said slyly.

&quot;Egotistical, occasionally immature, just a tad boorish, and an 
shameless flirt. Along with the fact I&#146;m not the one you&#146;re looking to 
marry. It&#146;s not a good idea to use me as a template to judge Selphie&#146;s 
reactions.&quot;

&quot;I get the point.&quot; He grumbled.

Quistis leaned back and folded her arms as she recalled her conversation 
with Selphie just days earlier and how she was wondering when Irvine 
would finally propose.

&quot;Just ask her.&quot; Quistis said flatly.

&quot;What is she says no.&quot;

&quot;Then she says no.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s not very comforting.&quot; He frowned.

&quot;Its wasn&#146;t meant to be. Ask her to marry you, you may be surprised.&quot; 
Quistis said knowingly.

&quot;Damn, this is big, perhaps I should wait until I&#146;m sure.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps, but I can say this. Girls usually hate being kept waiting.&quot; 
Quistis shrugged.

Irvine flinched and nodded. &quot;Yeah you&#146;re right.&quot; He sighed.

&quot;Do you love her?&quot;

&quot;Oh course I do!&quot;

&quot;And I&#146;m pretty certain she loves you.&quot;

&quot;Well, yeah.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s all you need to know then, I don&#146;t see what the problem is.&quot; 
Quistis shrugged.

&quot;That makes sense.&quot; Irvine smirked. &quot;Corny as all hell but it makes 
sense.&quot;

&quot;So, what are you going to do?&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m going to do it.&quot;

&quot;When?&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t know. It wouldn&#146;t be right to ask while everyone is in 
mourning.&quot; He frowned thoughtfully.

&quot;Actually, I think now would be a great time. We could all use some good 
news.&quot; She smiled sadly.

&quot;You think so?&quot; Irvine said, still unsure.

&quot;Yes I do, I know I feel better already.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Quistis.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s why I&#146;m here.&quot; She winked.

**********************

Squall sat at the kitchen table in the apartment he shared with Rinoa. 
Papers laying strewn about him as he flipped through various reports, 
something he&#146;d been doing for hours now. In the bedroom he could hear 
Rinoa hustling about, doing what, he had no idea. Finally she came out 
wearing simple sweat pants and a baggy sweater. In her hand she carried 
a bag stuffed with sodas and chips. He looked over at her as she walked 
past him wordless and towards the door.

&quot;Where are you going?&quot; He asked quietly.

&quot;Like you care.&quot; Rinoa said coolly then left before he could respond.

&quot;Hey!?&quot; Squall blurted in surprise as the door shut. &quot;Damn it.&quot; He 
frowned and thought about going after her.

&quot;No.&quot; He told himself angrily. &quot;She&#146;s just trying to goad you, and 
you&#146;ve got to much work to do, worry about it later.&quot;

*********************

Quistis entered Fujin&#146;s chamber and shivered, it was cooler than she had 
expected. Quiet music echoed in the dimly lit room and a fragrant scent 
hung in the air.

&quot;Fu?&quot; Quistis called quietly.

She slipped through the shadows until she found Fujin sitting atop her 
bed writing busily in a small book. On the nightstand nearby a couple of 
scented candles burned allowing her to see.

&quot;Fujin?&quot; Quistis called again as she approached.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Fujin mumbled then looked up at her.

&quot;You ready to go?&quot;

&quot;TIME?&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s already gotten dark, I&#146;m sure everyone is already up there. Are 
you still going?&quot; Quistis asked, sitting down by her.

Fujin nodded and closed the small book she&#146;d been writing in.

&quot;I didn&#146;t know you kept a diary.&quot; Quistis smirked.

&quot;SILLY HABIT.&quot;

&quot;Nah, I actually I wish I did, it&#146;s like I never had the time.&quot; She then 
giggled and looked at Fujin slyly. &quot;Am I in there?&quot;

&quot;YES.&quot;

&quot;Oh, can I have a look?&quot; Quistis said teasingly.

Fujin looked thoughtfully at her journal then offered it to her. Quistis 
was surprised and blinked.

&quot;Oh, wow, I was kidding hon, you don&#146;t have to do that.&quot;

Fujin smiled softly. &quot;People put their most private thoughts in diaries, 
they&#146;re not meant for others eyes.&quot;

&quot;SHARE WITH YOU.&quot; Fujin said softly.

Quistis blushed and folded her arms. Leaning forward slowly, Fujin 
kissed her sweetly. Quistis shivered and smiled.

&quot;READY?&quot; Fujin asked, caressing her cheek.

&quot;Oh I guess so.&quot; Quistis sighed regretfully.

By the time they made it to the roof, Selphie, Rinoa and Nicole where 
already there. All of them sat in a circle around a small fire that was 
burning in what looked like an old satellite dish.

&quot;Where&#146;s the boys?&quot; Quistis asked quizzically.

&quot;They wanted to make a beer run.&quot; Nicole droned.

&quot;Lovely.&quot; Quistis chuckled as she slipped in between Selphie and Rinoa.

&quot;Hey a drink now and again is okay.&quot; Selphie frowned.

&quot;Ahem, mom.&quot; Rinoa scowled.

&quot;Hey now, I mean, under the right circumstances of course.&quot; Selphie 
quickly added.

&quot;Um I&#146;m the only one here old enough to be drinking.&quot; Quistis said 
sternly.

&quot;Hey Fujin.&quot; Selphie waved cheerily, in an attempt to change the 
subject.

Fujin returned the wave awkwardly and sat down.

&quot;How long have they been gone?&quot; Quistis asked while politely declining a 
bag of chips offered by Nicole.

&quot;About a thirty minutes I guess.&quot; Selphie shrugged.

&quot;Men...&quot; Rinoa groaned, causing everyone to eye her curiously.

&quot;She&#146;s upset.&quot; Selphie whispered quietly to Quistis.

&quot;I have a right to be! They&#146;re all rotten and selfish.&quot; Rinoa huffed as 
she buried her hand in a bag of malt chocolate balls.

&quot;She&#146;s not to subtle is she.&quot; Selphie smirked.

Fujin had no idea what was going on and looked to Nicole with a look of 
confusion. Nicole shrugged apologetically and tossed her a soda.

&quot;What&#146;s wrong Rinoa?&quot; Quistis asked

&quot;Squall.&quot; Selphie mumbled from behind her drink.

&quot;He&#146;s a big stupid jerk.&quot; Rinoa pouted.

&quot;Oh dear.&quot; Quistis winced as Fujin chuckled to herself.

&quot;Who&#146;s a big stupid jerk?&quot; Celest asked as she walked towards them, 
carrying a bag of fireworks.

&quot;Squall.&quot; Rinoa, Selphie and Nicole said in unison.

&quot;Oh Okay.&quot; Celest shrugged and sat down.

&quot;Planning to blow up something?&quot; Selphie asked, snooping through the 
bag.

&quot;Get out of there, they&#146;re for later. I figured we could use the 
distraction.&quot; Celest swatted at her.

&quot;What happened Rinoa?&quot; Quistis asked, while Celest and Selphie chattered 
on.

&quot;He snapped at me.&quot; Rinoa sulked.

&quot;Snapped?&quot;

&quot;I tried to talk to him and he yelled at me to leave him alone.&quot;

&quot;Talk, about what?&quot;

&quot;About the stress he&#146;s under.&quot;

&quot;You should know by know hon, that Squall will only open up when he&#146;s 
good and ready. If you try and push him he just gets all moody and 
defensive.&quot;

&quot;I figured he&#146;d be able to talk to me by now. We&#146;ve been together for 
more than a year now.&quot; Rinoa frowned sadly.

&quot;You know what ya do to make him open up to you?&quot; Celest said knowingly.

&quot;You&#146;re disgusting.&quot; Nicole frowned.

&quot;Hey now. I didn&#146;t say anything.&quot; Celest said smartly.

&quot;Don&#146;t listen to her Rinoa.&quot; Selphie said snobbishly. &quot;She thinks she 
knows men just because she&#146;s been with so many.

&quot;I have not!&quot; Celest shrieked thoroughly insulted. &quot;I&#146;ll have you know 
I&#146;m saving myself for marriage.

&quot;Oh you all sound like a bunch of busy bodies.&quot; Quistis scolded.

Celest, Nicole and Selphie all turned to her and stuck their tongues out 
playfully then burst into laughter. Fujin rolled her eye and stood up to 
get away from the inane chattering.

&quot;Gee thanks guys, so glad you&#146;re taking this seriously.&quot; Rinoa pouted.

&quot;Don&#146;t let them upset you. They&#146;re just trying to have a good time.&quot; 
Quistis whispered to her. &quot;Give Squall sometime, he&#146;ll come around. Have 
a little faith in him.&quot;

&quot;I dunno, he&#146;s been such a jerk lately. I hope you&#146;re right.&quot; Rinoa 
sighed, gazing into the fire.

&quot;It&#146;ll work out.&quot; Quistis winked.

&quot;Ladies, trouble yourselves no more, I&#146;ve returned.&quot; Irvine called to 
them as he and Zell approached bags in hand,

&quot;Yo Fujin.&quot; Zell smirked and gave her the thumbs us as he walked past. 
Fujin eyed the bags and could smell that they had apparently started the 
drinking early. It did little to make her feel at ease; in fact it only 
reminded her of the keg parties Seifer used to throw.

&quot;Hey fireworks!&quot; Zell said eagerly, running to inspect the bag.

&quot;Get out of there!&quot; Celest shouted, tossing an empty can at him.

&quot;What did you get?&quot; Nicole asked guardedly.

&quot;Nothing too raunchy.&quot; Zell chuckled.

&quot;You&#146;ve been drinking already, ick!&quot; Nicole frowned and pushed him away 
playfully as he tried to kiss her. &quot;Just, give me a cooler, I hate those 
nasty things you and Kinneas drink.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re all going to get beer guts.&quot; Quistis mumbled as she slipped a 
bottle water from the bag she brought with her.

&quot;You&#146;re not having anything?&quot; Irvine asked curiously.

&quot;Nah, I&#146;m not in the mood. Besides you know I hardly ever drink.&quot;

&quot;What the hells going on here!&quot; Xu roared causing everyone to jump.

&quot;Busted.&quot; Selphie winced.

Xu and Nida strode over to the little gathering with a look most foul.

&quot;Some little party you guys have going here.&quot; She said evenly. &quot;No one 
invites poor Xu, I have to find out about it second hand from some 
students.&quot; She pouted abruptly.

&quot;Xu, I mean...&quot; Nicole stammered then glared at Rinoa. &quot;You were 
supposed to tell her!&quot;

&quot;Wha!!?&quot; Rinoa babbled.

Quistis took the opportunity to go to Fujin&#146;s side.

&quot;Everyone is just getting here and they&#146;re already yelling.&quot; She said 
mildly as Xu let her wrath loose on Rinoa and Nicole.

&quot;INDEED.&quot; Fujin said quietly, glancing over to the commotion with much 
disinterest.

&quot;I&#146;m beginning to think I&#146;m the local shrink. Rinoa and Irvine both have 
been asking my advice.&quot;

&quot;QUISTIS, WISE.&quot; Fujin said solemnly.

&quot;Ha...&quot; Quistis scoffed and sipped her water.

&quot;YOU ARE.&quot; Fujin assured her, gazing out over the star filled horizon.

&quot;You okay? Sorry everyone is a little rowdy. I guess they need to let 
loose.&quot; Quistis said apologetically. &quot;I can&#146;t really blame them.&quot;

&quot;SO DO YOU.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis asked, slightly confused.

&quot;LET LOOSE.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m fine, you know me, this is about as loose as I get.&quot;

Fujin arched an inquisitive brow at her.

&quot;Don&#146;t give me that look. I&#146;m okay really, I&#146;m coping.&quot;

&quot;IF SAY.&quot; Fujin said quietly and resumed looking back out over the 
horizon.

&quot;You realize of course that I&#146;m not letting you sit all by you lonesome 
over her all night.&quot; Quistis said in an oddly threatening tone.

&quot;GO HAVE FUN.&quot; Fujin prompted.

&quot;Not without you.&quot;

&quot;NOT FUN.&quot;

&quot;Liar.&quot;

&quot;SERIOUS.&quot;

&quot;Liar, liar.&quot; Quistis smirked as she moved behind her.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin balked as Quistis grabbed her by the shoulders and started 
shoving her back towards the group. &quot;RELEASE.&quot; She protested.

&quot;Nope.&quot; Quistis said sternly then made her sit down.

Irvine and Zell looked at her curiously.

&quot;Um want a beer?&quot; Zell offered.

Fujin&#146;s look of sheer contempt for the glimmering can could have melted 
it.

&quot;She&#146;s fine.&quot; Quistis said quietly, slipping a bottle of water into 
Fujin&#146;s hand.

Still fuming, Xu finally sat down and nursed a wine cooler, while Nida 
commenced to pleading with Zell to teach him to fly the Ragnarok.

&quot;Where&#146;s our fearless leader?&quot; Irvine asked, looking around curiously.

&quot;Don&#146;t ask.&quot; Most everyone except Rinoa said in unison.

&quot;Trouble in paradise eh?&quot; Xu mumbled.

&quot;Trouble in parablah.&quot; Rinoa mocked sourly.

&quot;Oh she&#146;s in a foul mood.&quot; Xu noted to Irvine.

&quot;Can we please all just relax and have fun here!&quot; Selphie shouted, 
flailing her arms over her head in a fashion similar to an enraged ape. 
Her gesture prompted a huge uproar from Irvine and Zell who nearly fell 
over each other laughing. Fujin cut Quistis an annoyed look as she 
folded her legs and got comfortable.

&quot;Hey we have a fire here, does that mean we get to sing camp songs? We 
used to sing them all the time in summer camp when I was growing up.&quot; 
Nida said nostalgically.

&quot;Hyne you&#146;re a dork.&quot; Xu chuckled, giving him a playful wink.

&quot;Hey! I&#146;ll have you know I&#146;m the man I am today because of what I 
learned in camp.&quot; Nida shouted defensively.

&quot;Now why don&#146;t I doubt that.&quot; Irvine said with a toothy grin.

&quot;You guys are horrible.&quot; Nicole sighed. &quot;Stop picking on him, he can&#146;t 
help it.&quot;

&quot;Now what&#146;s that supposed to mean!?&quot; Nida gaped.

&quot;You&#146;re just making things worse.&quot; Quistis whispered to him.

Rinoa listened to their laughter idly, while trying to put on a cheery 
fa&ccedil;ade.

*******************

It was around 8:00PM when Squall got the call. Apparently there were 
visitors to Balamb and they wished to speak to who ever was in charge. 
Usually Cid dealt with such matters but with everything that had been 
going on, Squall volunteered to take up his duties for awhile.

&quot;I&#146;ll be right down.&quot; Squall groaned.

It took him another ten minutes to reach the visitors docking bay. A 
small helicopter like craft sat in the hanger. A couple of Garden 
security staff members waited with three other people, two of who Squall 
recognized.

&quot;Watts, Zone, what are you doing here?&quot; Squall gawked in surprise. He 
had never expected to run into Rinoa&#146;s former Forest Owl teammates.

&quot;Glad to see you to man.&quot; Zone frowned slightly.

&quot;Sorry.&quot; Squall blinked and shook both of their hands. &quot;It&#146;s just been a 
while, and I wasn&#146;t expecting you.&quot;

&quot;No harm done Sir, nice to see you again.&quot; Watts smirked and looked 
around in awe. &quot;This is some place you have here.&quot;

&quot;You could say that.&quot; Squall said awkwardly. The third figured was a 
tall, handsome man with a deep tan and piercing blue eyes and short 
black hair.

&quot;Who&#146;s this?&quot; Squall asking, nodding towards the stranger.

&quot;This?&quot; Zone thumbed towards the guy.

&quot;Kevin.&quot; The stranger smirked and stepped forward to shake Squall&#146;s hand 
firmly.

&quot;Kevin? You look kind of familiar, have we met?&quot; Squall asked curiously.

&quot;I used to go to school here a few years ago.&quot; Kevin smiled.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Squall nodded. &quot;Sorry I can&#146;t place you.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t worry about it.&quot; The man smiled.

&quot;Why are you guys here? Is something wrong?&quot;

&quot;Not at all Sir.&quot; Watts said cheerfully. &quot;We heard what happened from 
Rinoa and came to pay our respects.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Squall nodded and turned curiously to Kevin.

&quot;I met these two jokers through Zone&#146;s little brother, I&#146;m his teacher 
at Timber Middle School. He mentioned coming here and I figured I&#146;d come 
too. It&#146;d be nice to say hi to a few friends. I hope it&#146;s not a 
problem.&quot; Kevin said hopefully.

&quot;Not at all, I&#146;ll have the security team take you to the guest hall.&quot; 
Squall said mechanically, he hated playing host.

&quot;If I may inquire sir, where&#146;s the Princess?&quot; Watts asked hopefully.

&quot;I don&#146;t know.&quot; Squall said with an obvious glimmer of annoyance. Kevin 
noticed and stepped forward.

&quot;Look guys, we&#146;ve trouble him enough. I&#146;m sure he&#146;s a busy man. Lets 
just get settled in first.&quot; Kevin suggested. &quot;How&#146;s that sound? Squall 
was it?

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Great, ready when you are.&quot; Kevin said graciously.

Squall gestured to the waiting security guards.

&quot;Take them to the Guest Hall, give them rooms and explain the rules. 
Page me if there is a problem.

&quot;Yes sir.&quot; The guards said firmly.

&quot;See you around.&quot; Squall nodded to each man before leaving.

&quot;I see he hasn&#146;t changed.&quot; Zone grumbled.

&quot;He&#146;s a good fellow.&quot; Watts said cheerfully.

&quot;She&#146;s too good for the likes of him.&quot; Zone said with a mild look of 
contempt.

&quot;Oh Hyne here we go. No one is good enough for her in you&#146;re eyes. 
You&#146;re just jealous.&quot;

&quot;No, I just want to look out for her.&quot; Zone protested.

As the two stood arguing, they didn&#146;t notice until a good moment later 
that Kevin and the guards had already well up the hall.

&quot;Yo! Kev wait up!&quot; Zone shouted as he and Watts chased after them.

***************************

The little get together was going well, everyone was in good spirits and 
more than few of them were a tad tipsy, most noticeably Zell and Xu, who 
were singing some raucous song from their youth. The night air was 
relaxing to Fujin, and the flicker of the fire was entrancing. While the 
others talked and laughed about old times, she sat quietly, observing, 
listening, taking it all in. They all shared something she never had 
before, that is, until Quistis.

She turned to her, gaze searching, and a quiet, introspective look on 
her face.

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis said to her with a smile.

Fujin blushed slightly and gentle smile brushed her lips. Quistis 
understood and gave her a playful wink. The singing quieted down and 
soon everyone was looking thoughtfully and sipping their assorted 
drinks. The fire crackled and the wind picked up slightly. Finally 
Irvine broke the silence.

&quot;Um...&quot; He said awkwardly as he rose to his feet.

Quistis sat back and smiled inwardly, having a good idea what was 
coming.

&quot;What&#146;s wrong?&quot; Selphie asked worried, seeing the uncomfortable look on 
his face.

&quot;Yeah man, you about to hurl or something, you&#146;re looking green?&quot; Zell 
chuckled.

&quot;Shush.&quot; Quistis hissed quietly to him.

&quot;Well...&quot; Irvine sighed, taking off his hat. &quot;

Nida and Xu exchanged worried glanced, Irvine looked about ready to 
faint.

&quot;What is it man? Spit it out.&quot; Nida prodded.

&quot;Selphie...&quot; Irvine said quietly then coughed and took a breath.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Selphie frowned.

&quot;I&#146;ve been thinking.&quot;

&quot;That can&#146;t be good.&quot; Celest chuckled; her actions earned her a slap to 
the head from Nicole and an elbow to the ribs from Rinoa.

&quot;You have?&quot; Selphie said curiously propping her elbows on her knees to 
study him.

&quot;Yeah I have.&quot; Irvine mumbled as he fidgeted with his hat.

Quistis leaned over grabbed Fujin&#146;s arm excitedly. Fujin looked at her 
incredulously but said nothing, curious as to what was going on.

&quot;We&#146;ve had our problems lately I know, but through it all...&quot; Irvine 
said quietly, pushing all others out of his mind as he focused on her.

&quot;Through it all though we&#146;ve came out stronger for it. You and I&#146;ve been 
through a lot together, and now...&quot; He took a breath and looked down for 
a moment as he gathered his thoughts. Selphie was beside herself but did 
a miraculous job of hiding it, in a way she was savoring his 
awkwardness. It was touching and all together sweet and she loved him 
for it.

&quot;Even before now, I&#146;ve been thinking about this. But now with things 
like they are, its only made my resolve that much firmer.&quot; He paused 
once more and looked to his feet as he tried to muster his courage. 
Celest meanwhile burst into tears, not that anyone noticed. Finally, 
looking up slowly his eyes locked onto Selphie. The small woman was 
beaming ear from ear, beautiful, and vibrant. Finding the courage he 
needed he bent to one knee and pulled a small ring from his pocket.

&quot;Will you marry me?&quot; He said smoothly.

Selphie surprised everyone with her reaction, especially herself as she 
promptly fainted.

&quot;Whoa!&quot; Irvine shouted, fumbling the ring as he caught her. Not as swept 
up in the moment, Fujin lunged forward and deftly snatched it out of the 
air before it landed in the fire.

&quot;INTERESTING.&quot; She mumbled curiously and sat back down.

With a scream of excitement, Rinoa jumped up and tackled the two, 
knocking over Nida in the process. Celest&#146;s crying turned into an 
outright fit of overjoyed hysteria that startled Zell and Nicole both.

Grinning broadly, Xu turned to Quistis. &quot;Wow, that came out of no 
where.&quot;

Rinoa scurried over and hugged the two women cheerfully, then 
surprisingly Fujin. Unsure what to make of it Fujin just smiled 
awkwardly and patted her on back. Quistis exploded into laughter.

An explosion sounded, and the sky lit up brightly with a shower of blue 
and golden sparks. Everyone looked around curiously to find Nicole 
giggling playfully with the bag of fireworks by her side.

&quot;Way to go dude!&quot; Zell shouted, clapping Irvine on the back.

Irvine wore a ridiculously huge grin and Selphie was still somewhat 
staggered.

&quot;Oh there is so much to do!&quot; Rinoa bubbled while skipping about in 
circles.

&quot;Please let me design the dresses, please, please, please, I studied 
fashion, designing as a sub course, I can do it, please, please!&quot; Celest 
shouted ecstatically at Selphie.

&quot;We have to get catering, and make a guests list!&quot; Nicole added.

&quot;Fist we need to decide where they will have it, and when.&quot; Xu 
proclaimed.

&quot;There they go.&quot; Zell sighed, handing Nida a beer and sitting down 
beside him.

&quot;Yup, we&#146;ll not see them for weeks.&quot; Nida responded quietly and drained 
the drink in one fell swoop.

Zell gawked at him for a moment then shook his head. &quot;Aw geeze what a 
night.&quot; He mumbled laughingly.

***************************

It was late, in the evening by the time Quistis and Fujin returned to 
Quistis&#146; apartment, the fireworks, the drinking, and the excitement had 
wore her out. She was smiling again, a good sign that she was recovering 
and Fujin couldn&#146;t help but be happy for her.

&quot;That was fun, I can&#146;t believe Irvine did that. I mean I knew ahead of 
time, but to actually hear him say it.&quot; Quistis said as she unlocked the 
door. &quot;Thanks for coming with me, I know you dislike that sort of thing 
but it was something we all needed.&quot; Quistis said quietly shutting the 
door.

&quot;A PLEASURE.&quot; Fujin shrugged.

&quot;Still, thank you.&quot; Quistis purred, stepping closer to her.

&quot;IT&#146;S OKAY.&quot;

Quistis tilted her head and regarded Fujin thoughtfully.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin blushed, looking about awkwardly.

&quot;Nothing.&quot; Quistis smiled.

&quot;WHY LOOK AT ME?&quot;

&quot;I can&#146;t look at you?&quot; Quistis quietly, taking her hands in hers. Fujin 
looked up at her shyly and smirked.

&quot;You had fun tonight, I know you did.&quot;

&quot;WAS OKAY.&quot;

&quot;Un huh, I figured you would once you got to blow something up.&quot; Quistis 
giggled.

&quot;ACCIDENT.&quot; Fujin pouted.

&quot;Irvine was furious, that was his favorite hat.&quot;

&quot;APOLOGIZED.&quot;

&quot;You have to admit though, it was funny.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Oh come now, surely just a little.&quot; Quistis teased.

Fujin couldn&#146;t help but smirk.

&quot;Un huh, I though so.&quot; Quistis chuckled seductively. Moving closer she 
pressed herself lightly against her. &quot;I just remembered something.&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Fujin murmured, thoroughly entranced as Quistis caressed her 
cheek. &quot;I saw you and Rinoa earlier, it looked like you two had a 
moment. Is there um something you want to tell me?&quot;

Fujin was totally caught unaware and her gaze widened.

&quot;WHAT!?&quot; She jerked in surprise.

Quistis turned and walked away slowly.

&quot;That hug you two shared.&quot; She sighed, while shaking her hair loose.

&quot;RIDICULOUS.&quot; Fujin balked.

&quot;I don&#146;t know.&quot; Quistis pouted.

&quot;TEASING.&quot; Fujin huffed, not buying it.

&quot;Am I?&quot; Quistis shrugged, slipping off her glasses and setting them on 
the coffee table.

&quot;YES.&quot;

&quot;Do you find her attractive?&quot;

&quot;WHAT!?&quot; Fujin convulsed at the thought.

&quot;Do you think she&#146;s pretty, if so I can invite her over one night.&quot; 
Quistis grinned as she slowly slipped out of her clothes.

&quot;NEGATIVE, JOKING, UNDESIRABLE!&quot; Fujin stammered in a mix of revulsion 
and disbelief. Clad now only in her undergarments Quistis sauntered back 
towards her, a coy grin dancing on her lips. Fujin stiffened, as Quistis 
cradled her chin with her hand and drew her in for a kiss.

&quot;Gotcha.&quot; She whispered playfully.

Fujin cringed and pushed her away lightly.

&quot;HORRIBLE, MEAN!&quot; She stammered.

&quot;Come on, don&#146;t tell me you actually believed me.&quot; Quistis laughed and 
caught her around the waist.

&quot;PICKING ON ME.&quot; Fujin huffed.

&quot;Oh don&#146;t pout, I&#146;m sorry. It&#146;s just tonight was fun and I&#146;m in a good 
mood, I couldn&#146;t help it.&quot; Quistis apologized, brushing the hair from 
Fujin&#146;s face.

&quot;HUMPF.&quot;

&quot;I get it, you&#146;re not talking now eh.&quot;

Fujin looked away snobbishly and Quistis couldn&#146;t help but laugh.

&quot;Don&#146;t do that it&#146;s not becoming.&quot; She giggled, but Fujin wasn&#146;t giving 
an inch. Quistis&#146; eyes thinned to slits and she smiled wickedly. &quot;Will 
you let me make it up to you then?&quot; She whispered warmly. Fujin looked 
her up and down in shock.

&quot;FLIRT.&quot; She said indignantly.

Quistis backed away. &quot;Okay then, I guess I won&#146;t buy breakfast 
tomorrow.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;Well.&quot; She said brightly. &quot;I&#146;m going to go 
take a shower, I feel dirty.&quot; She winked and headed towards the 
bathroom.

Fujin stood slack jawed then scowled mildly as she realized she&#146;d been 
toyed with.

&quot;HORRIBLE.&quot; She shouted with a huff.

&quot;Oh you love it.&quot; Quistis laughed merrily and shut the bathroom door.

**********************

Squall was sitting expectantly by the time Rinoa got home. Saying 
nothing Rinoa gave him a snotty look then headed to the bedroom without 
a word.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Squall yelled as she shut the door. &quot;Rinoa, wait a minute!&quot;

The door cracked and accusing eyes peered out at him.

&quot;Look, I&#146;m sorry.&quot; Squall sighed.

&quot;For what.&quot; Rinoa asked curiously.

&quot;For being an ass. I&#146;ve been stressed out and I took it out on you.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; She huffed and shut the door; Squall jammed his hand in to 
stop her and only succeeded in getting them pinched in the doorframe. 
Shouting in pain and aggravation he hopped about in a small circle. 
Rinoa winced and peeked out at him.

&quot;Sorry.&quot; She said meekly.

&quot;No, I deserved it.&quot; He said, shaking his hand in an attempt to 
alleviate the pain. Rinoa studied him a moment then stepped back in the 
room and leaned against the door to regard him a moment.

&quot;Perhaps.&quot; She said with a pout.

&quot;Forgive?&quot; He asked with a stressed grinned.

&quot;I don&#146;t know.&quot; She said in a spoiled voice, folding her arms cutely.

&quot;How many times can I say I&#146;m sorry.&quot; He sighed.

&quot;Irvine proposed to Selphie today.&quot; Rinoa said candidly as if gossiping.

&quot;What?&quot; He frowned, not sure if he heard her right.

&quot;They&#146;re getting married.&quot; Rinoa explained.

&quot;You&#146;re joking.&quot;

&quot;Nope.&quot; Rinoa sighed. &quot;Shame you weren&#146;t there.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re serious.&quot;

&quot;Uh huh, sure am.&quot;

&quot;Oh damn it.&quot; Squall scowled then looked up with a sigh. &quot;Well, that&#146;s 
wonderful.&quot; He slumped and looked at her sadly. &quot;Good for them, they&#146;ll 
make a good couple.&quot; He offered lamely and feeling like a heel.

Rinoa couldn&#146;t stand letting him suffer anymore.

&quot;Fine, you&#146;re forgiven.&quot; She said as if passing judgment.

Squall sighed with relief.

&quot;But tomorrow.&quot; She said firmly while wagging a finger at him. &quot;You&#146;re 
calling in and then you&#146;re taking me somewhere.&quot;

&quot;I can&#146;t do that.&quot;

&quot;Well fine then, have fun sleeping on the couch.&quot;

&quot;Hey now! Wait just a minute!&quot; Squall blurted angrily.

Rinoa folded her arms and eyed him sourly. Squall was set to argue the 
issue but then, inexplicably he relented. Perhaps he wanted some time 
off, or perhaps he just didn&#146;t want to argue, either way he nodded and 
gave in.

&quot;Fine, tomorrow I&#146;ll call in.&quot; He waved, can we just drop this now.

Rinoa laughed merrily and threw her arms around his neck.

&quot;Thank you!&quot; She said excitedly. &quot;We can go shopping pick up stuff for 
the wedding and get you a sized for a suit. No way you&#146;re going to my 
friends wedding dressed in that funky jacket of yours.&quot;

&quot;What? When is it?&quot;

&quot;I dunno.&quot; Rinoa shrugged, still beaming.

&quot;Whatever.&quot; Squall groaned and rolled his eyes. &quot;You&#146;ve got visitors.&quot; 
He said abruptly, nearly having forgotten.

&quot;Zone and Watts?&quot; Rinoa squealed.

&quot;Yeah they came a few hours ago.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#146;t tell me!?&quot;

&quot;Didn&#146;t know where you were.&quot;

&quot;Oh damn, where are they?&quot;

&quot;Probably in their rooms.&quot;

&quot;Are they coming by?&quot;

&quot;They didn&#146;t say.&quot;

&quot;Poot.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Nothing, I guess I&#146;ll just see them in the morning.&quot; She sighed.

&quot;Am I on the couch?&quot; Squall mumbled.

&quot;What?&quot; Rinoa blinked, focusing on him again. &quot;No, why?&quot;

&quot;Goodnight then.&quot; He yawned; slipping past her and falling face first 
onto the bed.

***************************

&quot;A KNOCK?&quot; Fujin asked raising up.

&quot;Don&#146;t care.&quot; Quistis growled playfully, pulling her back to her.

This time they both heard a knock and Fujin raised up again, this time 
hitting her head on the bathroom sink.

&quot;DAMN!&quot; Fujin grumbled rubbing her head.

&quot;Oh what now.&quot; Quistis sighed as another knock sounded.

Putting on a robe and grabbing a towel to dry her hair, she hurried to 
the door while Fujin checked her scalp in the mirror.

&quot;It&#146;s a little late.&quot; Quistis groaned as she opened the door.

Kevin looked around and frowned slightly.

&quot;Well I know, but was hoping you&#146;d be glad to see me.&quot;

&quot;Do I know you?&quot; Quistis asked warily, drawing her robe closer about 
her. Fujin heard voices, and quietly shut the bathroom door, having left 
her clothes in the living room.

&quot;It&#146;s me Kevin, you don&#146;t remember me do you?&quot; The man said sadly.

Quistis&#146; eyes went wide a saucers. &quot;Kevin!?&quot;

&quot;In the flesh.&quot; He grinned.

&quot;Oh Hyne...&quot; She stammered and backed up. Thinking she meant to let him 
in he slipped inside. &quot;I missed you Quisty.&quot; He smiled.

&quot;Kevin.&quot; Quistis blinked and shut the door, still in shock.

&quot;You okay?&quot;

&quot;Fine, I&#146;m good.&quot; She babbled. &quot;How are you?&quot;

&quot;Great, even more so now that I&#146;ve found you. How long has it been?&quot;

&quot;Um... wow, um...nearly eight years.&quot; Quistis smirked in confusion.

&quot;You look wonderful.&quot; He said with a smile.

&quot;Thank, Kevin, so do you. How have you been? Here, here have a seat.&quot; 
Quistis said, gesturing to the couch. Kevin sat down and looked 
curiously at Fujin&#146;s clothes lying nearby.

&quot;Just get home?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Quistis smirked, sorry for the mess. &quot;So Kevin, when, how?&quot; She 
started but didn&#146;t even know were to begin.

Pressing her ear to the bathroom door Fujin recognized the name, 
recalling Quistis telling her about an old friend from when she was 
younger. Resigning herself to the fact she could be stuck for a while 
she looked around for a towel only to realize Quistis took it with her.

&quot;DAMN IT.&quot; She mumbled quietly.

&quot;Do you know a Watts and Zone?&quot; Kevin asked Quistis in an attempt to 
answer her questions.

&quot;Yeah, from Timber, a friend of mine knows them.&quot;

&quot;Well so do I, when they told me they were coming here I decided to tag 
along.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; Quistis nodded.

&quot;Quistis Trepe.&quot; He said with a smile. &quot;Instructor now too I hear.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that&#146;s me.&quot; She giggled nervously.

&quot;You made it, I&#146;m proud of you.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, what about you, what have you been doing?&quot;

&quot;Me, oh I just started teaching. I&#146;m a social studies teacher at Timber 
Middle, not so adventurous as what you teach but hey, it&#146;s a start eh.&quot;

&quot;True, very true.&quot;

&quot;So, are you seeing anyone?&quot; He asked with a smile. Quistis stood up and 
walked to the kitchen.

&quot;How rude of me, I haven&#146;t offered you a drink. Are you thirsty?&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m okay.&quot;

&quot;Mind if I get something then?&quot;

&quot;Not at all.&quot;

&quot;I missed you Quisty.&quot; He said quietly.

&quot;I missed you too Kevin, it&#146;s been a long time.&quot; Quistis mumbled as she 
sipped her drink and walked back to the living room.

&quot;I heard about what happened. I&#146;m sorry about your student. Are you 
okay?

&quot;Yeah, I think so, I try not to dwell on it to much or I get really 
depressed. I can&#146;t help but feel responsible. Then Edea died, it&#146;s been 
a bad few couple of weeks.&quot;

&quot;It must be hard, doing what you do. At least you&#146;ve got friends to help 
see you through it all.&quot;

&quot;That I do, they&#146;re great.&quot;

&quot;I hope to meet them, you&#146;ll have to introduce me.&quot;

&quot;I will. How long are you staying?&quot;

&quot;We&#146;re between seasons back home so I can stay a while.&quot; He smiled and 
blushed slightly. &quot;I was kind of hoping we could spend sometime 
together. Like the good old days.&quot;

Quistis looked at him guardedly. &quot;A lot has changed Kevin.&quot;

&quot;I know. I&#146;m not asking for anything. I just miss an old friend and want 
to spend some time with her.&quot; He said quickly trying to dissuade her 
worries.

&quot;As friends.&quot; Quistis reiterated, just to be certain they were on the 
same page.

&quot;Unless you change your mind.&quot; He grinned hopefully.

&quot;Kevin.&quot; She said with a frown.

&quot;Okay, okay, calm down. Mind if I use your restroom?&quot; He asked, rising 
to his feet.

&quot;Sure go ahead, it&#146;s over there.&quot; Quistis sighed, pointing, then 
remembered Fujin was in there and abruptly jumped to her feet. &quot;WAIT!&quot;

Kevin was just about to the door when her outburst made him pause.

&quot;What?&quot; He asked, slightly worried.

&quot;That&#146;s the bathroom.&quot; She stammered.

&quot;Yeah I kinda figured.&quot; He chuckled.

&quot;It&#146;s backed up.&quot; She said slowly.

&quot;Oh, well let me take a look perhaps I can fix it.&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; She nearly shrieked.

He paused once more and folded his arms and studied her curiously.

&quot;And why not?&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s bad...really, really bad.&quot; She nodded darkly.

&quot;Oh I have a house I have to do this kind of thing all the time. It&#146;d 
really be no problem.&quot; He assured her.

Quistis quickly interjected herself between him and the door. On the 
other side, Fujin sat idly on the edge of the tub and really wishing 
Quistis had left her a towel.

&quot;It&#146;s okay really.&quot; Quistis said with a warm smile. &quot;You came all this 
way to visit not play around with backed up toilets. Maintenance will 
take care of it.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure?&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m positive.&quot; She said putting her hands on his chest and pushing 
backwards to the couch.

&quot;Alright then.&quot; He shrugged and sat back down.

Quistis glanced out of the corner of her eye to the bathroom. She could 
only imagine what Fujin was thinking.

&quot;She&#146;s going to kill me.&quot; She thought sheepishly.

*******************

With a roar the great reptilian beast collapsed heavily on the ground. 
Descending quickly upon it Seifer delivered the killing blow then backed 
off. The victory felt hollow and tossed his gunblade down in annoyance.

&quot;What am I doing.&quot; He groaned. The lights dimmed and soon water began to 
fall, dousing the entire center in an artificial rain.

&quot;Great.&quot; He sighed, running his hands throw the tangles of his blonde 
hair.

&quot;Edea, what were you thinking.&quot; He mumbled and retrieved his blade. 
Walking slowly through the mud and brush he soon found himself standing 
before the hatch that led out onto the service balcony.

He, like so many other students would sneak out on the balcony after 
hours. Putting his shoulder to the hatch he shoved it open and stepped 
out into the night air. A smile drifted across his lips as he looked to 
the heavens. Memories of sitting outside with Fujin and Rajin glimmered 
in his mind and he chuckled softly.

He recalled how the two of them would fight and bicker in a purely 
sibling sort of way. And while he himself wasn&#146;t related to either of 
them, they still accepted him as family.

&quot;You two always kept me on my toes.&quot; He sighed. &quot;Stayed with me through 
thick and thin.&quot;

The wind howled and chilled him; his wet clothes only heightening is 
discomfort. He didn&#146;t care though as his memories tortured him. Fujin&#146;s 
face came to mind and his heart ached.

&quot;What I did to you...&quot; He said quietly, looking down at his gunblade. 
&quot;What I did to all of you.&quot; Looking up with a frown he gazed out at the 
stars for a long while. &quot;I&#146;m sorry.&quot; He whispered then slung the weapon 
into the night sky. The blade spiraled through the air where it struck 
the spinning disks hovering under Balamb, and in a flash of magical 
energy, disintegrated.

***********************

&quot;Hyne I can&#146;t believe it. You&#146;ve done all that in just a few short 
years.&quot; Kevin chuckled. &quot;I am truly humbled.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t be. Look at me, I&#146;m a wreck because of it.&quot; Quistis frowned 
ruefully.

&quot;No you&#146;re not. Just think of all the good you guys have done.&quot; Kevin 
smiled, putting a comforting hand on her shoulder.

&quot;Yeah I know, sometimes though it&#146;s really, really hard. Over the last 
few I&#146;ve lost three students, another one quit and left just the other 
day. It&#146;s really hard not to blame myself.&quot; She sighed.

&quot;You&#146;ll be fine, I know it.&quot; He smiled and stood to stretch then frowned 
regretfully at a nearby clock. &quot;Oh man look at the time. I better go, I 
didn&#146;t mean to keep you up so late.&quot;

Quistis looked at the time and all color drained from her face, they&#146;d 
been talking for two hours.

&quot;Oh no...&quot; She mumbled.

&quot;Yeah really, I&#146;m sorry. I bet you&#146;ve got to be at work in the morning.&quot; 
He apologized.

&quot;No, no, it&#146;s okay, I&#146;ll see you later.&quot; She mumbled walking him to the 
door.

They paused and he looked her over with a smile.

&quot;It&#146;s great seeing you again Quisty.&quot;

&quot;Its good to see you too Kev.&quot; She smiled weakly.

&quot;Get some sleep. See you tomorrow, over breakfast? You can introduce me 
to you&#146;re friends.&quot;

&quot;Sure thing.&quot; She nodded.

&quot;Good night.&quot; He waved.

&quot;Night.&quot; She waved back then shut the door then leaned back against it 
with a sigh. Gazing at the bathroom door as if it were a gate to hell, 
she timidly, crept towards it.

&quot;Fu?&quot; She squeaked.

No answer was forth coming and she gently opened the door. Fujin was 
waiting for her, naked, frowning and a look of complete disgust on her 
face.

&quot;Oh Fujin...&quot; Quistis whispered meekly. Fujin slipped past her and 
started gathering her clothes.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry, what could I do. I hadn&#146;t seen him in years.&quot;

Sliding on her pants, Fujin ignored her.

&quot;I didn&#146;t know he was going to stay so long. I&#146;m sorry.&quot;

After putting on her shirt Fujin headed to the door.

&quot;Wait, don&#146;t leave mad.&quot; Quistis pleaded. &quot;Fujin wait! What could I have 
done? I couldn&#146;t just kick him out.&quot;

Fujin didn&#146;t want to hear it and started to open the door. Quistis 
scurried to it and pressed her back against it to block her exit.

&quot;Don&#146;t go.&quot; She pouted. &quot;Please...&quot;

Fujin folded her arms and frowned.

&quot;TWO HOURS.&quot;

&quot;I know, I&#146;m horrible.&quot;

&quot;TWO HOURS...&quot; She huffed. &quot;NAKED.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;ve a right to be mad.&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;I was stupid, I should&#146;ve thought of something.&quot;

&quot;AGREE.&quot;

Quistis sighed and hung her head and sniffed lightly. Fujin&#146;s frown 
softened and she grumbled at her inability to stay mad.

&quot;IT&#146;S OKAY.&quot; She mumbled.

&quot;No it&#146;s not, I miss you.&quot;

&quot;RIGHT HERE?&quot; Fujin frowned.

&quot;I mean being with you, we&#146;ve hardly had anytime together recently.

&quot;HERE NOW.&quot;

Fujin smirked, opening her arms. With a soft smile Quistis stepped 
forward into the welcome embrace.

&quot;BETTER?&quot; Fujin smirked, running a soothing hand through her hair. 
Quistis nodded, resting her head her shoulder.

******************

By breakfast time, all of Balamb Garden had heard the news of the 
impending wedding. It brought a much-needed dose of joy into the hearts 
of the students and staff. Even Cid was heartened by the news and he 
left his office for the first time since the funerals to give 
congratulations. More thrilling for him was when Selphie asked him to 
give her away. The pain of loosing his beloved wife seemed to wash away 
in those moments, at least for a little while. As Quistis made her way 
through the cafeteria she was staggered at the sheer number of 
chattering young women that stood in a horde around where Selphie sat 
trying to eat.

The poor girl seemed overwhelmed, but was handling it all graciously. 
Feeling sorry for her, Quistis walked over and regarded the gathered 
students sternly.

&quot;You&#146;re all causing a scene, leave her be and let her eat.&quot; She said 
firmly.

&quot;Aw miss Trepe, we just wanted to congratulate her.&quot; One girl cried in 
dismay.

&quot;I know, we all do. But there is a time and place for all of that. Now 
go back to your seats.&quot;

The crowd began to disperse amid disappointed grumbles.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Selphie grinned. &quot;I could hardly breath.&quot;

&quot;Everyone&#146;s happy for you. It&#146;s nice to have good news around here for a 
change.&quot; Quistis smiled, sitting down with her tray.

&quot;I know what you mean.&quot;

&quot;Where&#146;s Irvine?&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m not sure. He left with Zell earlier this morning.

&quot;Curious...Anything wrong?&quot;

&quot;Nah, I think they&#146;re probably planning a bachelor party or something 
juvenile.

&quot;Oh dear.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, men are so sleazy.&quot; Selphie droned, slurping thoughtfully on a 
cinnamon stick.

&quot;You&#146;re wanting a bachelorett party aren&#146;t you?&quot; Quistis chuckled.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Selphie blinked innocently.

&quot;I thought so.&quot;

&quot;What did I say?&quot;

&quot;Nothing, you just got that randy look in your eye.&quot;

&quot;What randy look!?&quot;

&quot;Same one you got when tried to drag us into that strip club.&quot;

&quot;Ugh, am I that transparent?&quot;

&quot;Like glass.&quot; Quistis chuckled.

&quot;Oh well, you only live once.&quot; Selphie shrugged and looked around. 
&quot;Where&#146;s Rinoa I heard someone say her friends from Timber are here?

&quot;I don&#146;t know. An old friend of mine came with them though. They&#146;ll be 
here soon enough I reckon.&quot;

&quot;Old friend?&quot; Selphie said with interest.

&quot;Yeah, he used to go to school here, a real prodigy&quot;

&quot;He?&quot; Selphie said, this time grinning. &quot;What&#146;s his name.&quot;

&quot;Kevin.&quot; Quistis answered sipping her drink casually.

&quot;Kevin eh, so, what&#146;s this Kevin do.&quot;

&quot;He teaches middle school in Timber.&quot;

&quot;Oooh a teacher.&quot; Selphie beamed. Quistis finally noticed the 
innuendoes.

&quot;Okay, stop it right there, nothing is happening.&quot;

&quot;Yet?&quot; Selphie quickly added.

&quot;It&#146;s not like that, he&#146;s just a friend.&quot;

&quot;Oh, oh sure.&quot; Selphie nodded.

&quot;Stop it.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;You know what.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m not doing anything but sitting her listening.&quot;

&quot;Sure your not. Kevin and I are just old friends, that&#146;s all.&quot;

&quot;Morning girls.&quot; Celest yawned, sitting down to join them.

&quot;Morning.&quot; Quistis nodded.

&quot;Hey Celest, how are you? Guess what.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Quistis here has a guy friend.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Celest looked up curiously. &quot;Who is it?&quot;

&quot;Selphie, darn it, you&#146;re going to start a rumor.&quot; Quistis snapped.

&quot;Kevin.&quot; Selphie said teasingly.

&quot;Who&#146;s Kevin?&quot; Celest asked.

&quot;A old boyfriend.&quot; Selphie said knowingly.

&quot;He&#146;s just a friend.&quot; Quistis corrected.

&quot;Ohhh is he cute?&quot; Celest wondered aloud.

&quot;I dunno, he showed up last night with some of Rinoa&#146;s pals.&quot;

&quot;Interesting.&quot;

&quot;Would you two stop it!&quot; Quistis growled in a hushed whisper.

&quot;It&#146;s okay Quisty we can keep you&#146;re new boyfriend secret.&quot; Selphie 
smiled.

&quot;Who has a new boyfriend?&quot; Nicole asked as she approached.

&quot;Quistis.&quot; Celest said with a grin.

&quot;That&#146;s enough you two I mean it?&quot;

&quot;Quistis how could you, you didn&#146;t tell us. How long has this been going 
on?&quot; Nicole pouted as she sat down.

&quot;For the last time nothing is going on!&quot; Quistis said in exasperation.

Fujin was right behind Nicole and sat down oblivious to what was going 
on.

&quot;Fujin, did you know?&quot; Nicole asked, still frowning.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin wondered, eyeing them all suspiciously.

&quot;Hey now!&quot; Quistis hissed dangerously.

&quot;Quisty&#146;s seeing some guy and keeping it a secret.&quot; Celest said in a 
huff, folding her arms.

Fujin arched a brow and looked to Quistis expectantly.

&quot;It&#146;s not true.&quot; Quistis stammered.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin answered. &quot;EXPLAIN.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s not true. They think me and... Kevin!&quot; Quistis stood up and 
smiled. &quot;There you are.&quot; She finished weirdly.

&quot;Um hello?&quot; Kevin said eyeing her curiously as he Rinoa, Watts and Zone 
made their way to a nearby table.

&quot;Ohh he&#146;s cute.&quot; Celest whispered to Selphie.

Fujin looked up and snorted derisively at the sight of him.

&quot;Hi guys, I&#146;d like to introduce you to some friends.&quot; Rinoa beamed.

&quot;Everyone this is Watts. Quistis, Selphie, you remember him.&quot;

&quot;How&#146;s it going, long time no see.&quot; Watts grinned.

The two women nodded and waved as Rinoa continued the introductions.

&quot;This is Zone. We all go way back.&quot;

&quot;Um...Hi....&quot; He said awkwardly, trying not to stare at Celest who was 
sizing the three of them up like intensely.

&quot;This here is Kevin, he&#146;s Quistis&#146; friend.&quot; Rinoa grinned hugely, giving 
the embattled instructor a wink.

&quot;Gods.&quot; Quistis groaned and sat back down as Rinoa went to introduce the 
ladies.

&quot;This is Selphie. She&#146;s our soon to be bride and mom.&quot; Rinoa grinned, 
patting her on the head.

&quot;Hey guys, nice to meet you.&quot; Selphie chirped as Rinoa moved on.

&quot;Nicole, she&#146;s the resident brain. Bit nerdy but she&#146;s cool.&quot; She 
giggled as Nicole swatted at her. Rinoa scampered behind Celest next.

&quot;This is Celest, she&#146;s a floozy, just ignore her.&quot; She giggled.

&quot;She&#146;s just jealous.&quot; Celest explained, shoving Rinoa away playfully. 
Laughing cheerfully Rinoa made her way to Fujin.

&quot;TOUCH ME AND DIE.&quot; Fujin hissed at her. Rinoa blanched then looked up 
at the three men apologetically.

&quot;Fujin here speaks for herself.&quot; Rinoa said in a matter of fact tone 
before going to Quistis.

&quot;And you all know our esteemed mentor. Quistis Trepe.&quot;

&quot;Rinoa...&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Rinoa grinned leaning down to her.

&quot;Sit down.&quot; She all but growled, her blue eyes dancing dangerously.

&quot;Um, sure thing.&quot; Rinoa smiled sheepishly and took a seat.

&quot;So this is the man of the hour huh? Well pull up a seat sugar and tell 
us about yourself.&quot; Celest prompted, scooting over to make room for him.

&quot;Okay.&quot; Kevin grinned nervously as all eyes locked on him.

&quot;What&#146;s the fuss about him?&quot; Zone mumbled to Watts.

&quot;Dunno, but the redhead is a cutie.&quot; Watts whispered back, nodding 
towards Celest.

&quot;Well there&#146;s really nothing to tell.&quot; Kevin started, looking 
embarrassed.

Quistis buried her head in her hands while Selphie and Nicole glared at 
her accusingly, Fujin too was watching curiously but was less obvious.

&quot;Everyone has a story hon, are you married?&quot; Celest grinned.

&quot;Oh she&#146;s quick.&quot; Nicole giggled to Selphie, who teetered merrily.

&quot;Not at the moment...&quot; Kevin answered, blushing slightly. Celest looking 
knowingly at Quistis and nodded her approval.

&quot;All of you leave him alone. You&#146;re embarrassing him.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;We&#146;re not embarrassing you are we hon?&quot; Celest asked, giving him doe 
eyes.

&quot;Not at all...&quot;

&quot;So how long have you two been seeing each other?&quot; Selphie asked 
bluntly.

Quistis blanched and nearly stood up to protest.

&quot;Pardon?&quot; Kevin blinked uncomprehendingly.

&quot;Rumor has it you two are seeing each other?&quot; Rinoa grinned.

&quot;Hey you never told us that?&quot; Watts frowned.

&quot;No wonder he wanted to come back.&quot; Zone mumbled.

&quot;That&#146;s enough damn it!&quot; Quistis shouted, making everyone jump.

Fujin leaned back in her seat to enjoy the show as Quistis exploded.

&quot;I refuse to sit here and let you guys embarrass me and harass my 
friend!&quot; She raved loudly. &quot;Now here&#146;s what we&#146;re going to do, we&#146;re all 
going to sit here and eat like normal people. No more stupid innuendoes, 
no more prying questions, and no more tormenting our guests! Just a 
nice, quiet, breakfast with friends! Do I make my self clear here, 
because you do not want me to have to explain myself again!&quot; She 
screamed loudly, eyes shut and hands shaking with anger.

Fujin was blown away and her expression showed it. Wide-eyed and mouth 
agape, she&#146;d never seen Quistis vent in such a matter. Everyone in the 
cafeteria was watching her with intently. Adjusting her glasses and 
taking a breath Quistis opened her eyes.

&quot;Thank you.&quot; She said through a forced smile.

Selphie blinked and looked about to speak. Thinking better of it, she 
quietly went back to her food. Rinoa frowned but remained quiet also. 
Nicole and Celest exchanged glances and grins before resuming their 
meals.

&quot;Um, well then.&quot; Kevin coughed, scratching his head.

&quot;Sorry about all of this.&quot; Quistis murmured, blushing.

&quot;Is she always like that?&quot; Zone asked Rinoa quietly.

&quot;We&#146;ve all be under a lot of stress.&quot; She answered dryly.

&quot;It looks it.&quot; Watts whispered.

********************************

Later that afternoon, Selphie had returned to her apartment and was just 
getting ready to head out again when she heard a knock. Opening the 
door, she was less than pleased with what she found.

&quot;Hello.&quot; Seifer said quietly.

Selphie rolled her eyes and shut the door in his face. Seifer knocked 
again and it was a long while before she answered again.

&quot;I have nothing to say to you.&quot; She hissed.

&quot;I know, but I have something to say to you.&quot; Seifer said quietly.

&quot;Tough&quot; She sneered and shut the door.

&quot;I want to apologize.&quot; He called through the door.

The door swung up wide and she stepped close to him.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry.&quot; He said softly, his eyes resolved and mournful. Quicker 
than either one of them would have expected she slapped him across the 
mouth. The strike was resounding and painful but Seifer didn&#146;t flinch.

&quot;Don&#146;t you dare try to apologize.&quot; Selphie scowled.

&quot;I know, there&#146;s nothing I can do now to set things right.&quot; Seifer 
sighed, looking down at her. &quot;I just wanted to talk to you, to say I&#146;m 
sorry.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s not me you need to apologize to you asshole.&quot; She choked.

&quot;Yes I do...&quot;

Selphie turned and walked back into her apartment, leaving him standing 
in the doorway.

&quot;I can&#146;t imagine what it&#146;s been like for all of you. Squall, Rinoa, 
Fujin, your friends in Trabia.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Selphie whispered softly, still facing away from him. &quot;What did I 
do to you, what did any of us do to you.&quot; Selphie asked quietly, tears 
welling up in her eyes.

&quot;There&#146;s no one answer, and none of them could satisfy you.&quot;

&quot;I hate you.&quot;

&quot;All of you do.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re not getting anything from me. I just hope you go off somewhere 
and die.&quot;

&quot;Someday perhaps, but until then there&#146;s something I must do.&quot;

&quot;Quistis told me.&quot;

&quot;What did she say?&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re going to Trabia.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;You don&#146;t honestly believe you can just waltz in and say, Oh hi guys 
I&#146;m one of the guys who killed your friends and blew up your home. Gee 
I&#146;m sorry about that.&quot; She ranted sarcastically. &quot;I&#146;ll tell them who you 
are. I&#146;ll explain everything to them, who you are and what really 
happened. You see; I&#146;m not like Squall and the others. I don&#146;t feel I&#146;ve 
let you down somehow and turned you into what you are. I&#146;m not under 
this grand delusion that you can be redeemed or saved. Why do you 
deserve to be saved, what about my friends, my family, can they be 
saved? &quot;

&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re damned right they can&#146;t.&quot; She shouted, her voice thick with 
emotion. &quot;And it&#146;s because of people like you that they&#146;re gone. Oh sure 
you&#146;re not the only one to blame, I know that. But I have to face the 
devil I know! You&#146;re a horrible, evil, selfish man and you deserve 
everything that&#146;s happened to you! Don&#146;t think that saying you&#146;re sorry 
and walking around seeking forgiveness will trying to repent is going to 
solve anything, people are still dead and you had a hand in it.&quot;

&quot;I want you to tell them. It&#146;s time I be a man and face up to what I&#146;ve 
done.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Selphie turned, eyeing him suspiciously. &quot;I thought you we&#146;re 
going to try and make a new life for yourself. Isn&#146;t that what Edea 
wanted?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;ll be hard to do if you&#146;re in prison or worse.&quot;

&quot;Why do you care?&quot;

&quot;Oh don&#146;t worry, I don&#146;t. I hope they throw you in a hole somewhere. I&#146;m 
just curious as to why you changed your mind. I thought you respected 
her last wishes?&quot;

&quot;I do, more than you know. But I can&#146;t start over until I put the past 
behind me. If I&#146;m killed or locked away first, so be it, at least you&#146;ll 
have your revenge.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s not about revenge you pompous prick. It&#146;s about doing what&#146;s 
right. I can&#146;t help but think you&#146;ve got this romantic dream worked up 
in that thick head of yours. I can see it now, you think you&#146;ll go there 
moaning how sorry you are and offering yourself to them. Then what, I 
imagine you think they&#146;ll say. Oh no Mr. Seifer there&#146;s been to much 
suffering, we forgive you, please go, live you&#146;re life with our 
blessing.&quot; She laughed mockingly. &quot;Yeah guy, you think that.&quot; She 
chuckled, shaking her head.

&quot;Seifer, you&#146;re a piece of work you know that. There&#146;s no fixing what&#146;s 
happened, and if you go there you&#146;re good as dead and I don&#146;t want your 
death haunting me.&quot; Her eyes narrowed then she smiled a downright 
vicious smile. &quot;I get it now.&quot; She said quietly. &quot;You&#146;re telling the 
truth, the guilt of it, the shame, you can&#146;t live with it.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; He sighed heavily. Selphie studied him for a moment and a look of 
understanding came over her face. He was broken, his broad shoulders 
were slumped and his face showed the strain of someone who hadn&#146;t slept 
well. Selphie let out a short, bitter laugh.

&quot;What&#146;s so funny.&quot;

&quot;You.&quot; She smirked smugly.

&quot;What do you mean.&quot;

&quot;I think Edea was right. You need to just move on and live with it, let 
it eat you alive.&quot;

&quot;I can&#146;t, live like this.&quot;

&quot;I know, and so did she.&quot; Selphie said darkly.

&quot;What?&quot; Seifer frowned uncomprehendingly.

&quot;Are you familiar with the old saying. There&#146;s no hell worse than the 
one we make for ourselves.&quot;

&quot;What&#146;s that have to do with anything&quot; Seifer frowned.

&quot;Figure it out on you&#146;re on, now get out.&quot; She said firmly, her smirk 
fading instantly. &quot;Never speak to me again and stay away from Trabia, I 
don&#146;t want you&#146;re death on my hands. Besides, they can&#146;t give you what 
you&#146;re looking for. No one can.&quot;

****************************

&quot;Dude I still can&#146;t believe you did that.&quot; Zell chuckled from behind the 
wheel of their rent-a-car.

&quot;Yeah, well, what can I say.&quot; Irvine shrugged. &quot;It was time, I mean, no 
kid of mine will be born out of wedlock.&quot;

&quot;Surely there&#146;s more to it that that?&quot;

&quot;Oh hey, don&#146;t get me wrong, I love her to death. I&#146;m sure I would have 
asked sooner or later, but with the baby coming.&quot;

&quot;You opted for sooner.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re catching on.&quot;

&quot;So are you nervous?&quot;

&quot;I thought I would be, but I think I&#146;m alright.&quot;

Zell shivered slightly then looked at him in awe.

&quot;Hell, you&#146;re a better man than me then. I think I&#146;d crap myself. Just 
think about it for a minute. Wedding day, you&#146;re in a stuffy suit, 
scores of people watching you. You&#146;re getting ready to make the biggest 
decision of your life. You&#146;re entire future hinging on two little words. 
And in that moment you have to be asking yourself. Is she the one, is 
she the one I want to spend my life with. I mean what if you&#146;re wrong, 
what it all goes to the crapper then what you&#146;ve entered an oath to each 
other. What then, do you break it off and get a divorce? Then you have 
kids. Wow that&#146;s a big deal man. No more late night parties for you, 
you&#146;re a dad now you gotta lead by example. Whoa then they grow up, and 
you gotta send them out into the world. That&#146;s a lot to have hanging 
over you. Especially in a room full of people watching you like a hawk, 
waiting for those two words... I do...&quot; He then whistled low and shook 
his head. &quot;Now that&#146;s stress.&quot;

Irvine looked mortified.

&quot;You okay dude?&quot; Zell asked worriedly as his friend paled.

&quot;Thanks Zell, thanks a lot, you really put me at ease there.&quot; Irvine 
grumbled and rolled down the window for some air.

&quot;So why again did we buy all this stuff?&quot; Zell asked, gesturing to a 
pile of bags in the backseat.

&quot;She still has those cravings.&quot;

&quot;Oh yuck not the apricots and gravy again.&quot; Zell blanched.

&quot;Nah, this time its, herbs and exotic teas. It&#146;s all part of some kind 
of herbal kick she&#146;s on. She&#146;s been reading all these wild baby books 
recently. I figured I&#146;d surprise her and pick some up.&quot;

&quot;I was wondering what the rabbit food was for.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s freeze dried herbal pellets.&quot;

&quot;Yeah I know, rabbit food.&quot; Zell laughed.

&quot;Just drive.&quot; Irvine chuckled.

**************************

&quot;Sorry about earlier.&quot; Quistis frowned.

&quot;Don&#146;t be.&quot; Kevin chuckled as they sat on the wall near Balamb&#146;s front 
gates. Fujin was perched comfortably in a nearby tree, watching the two 
with mild interest. Quistis had made it quite clear that they were only 
friends. Not that Fujin was worried, she had full faith and trust in 
Quistis, no matter how flighty she was at times.

&quot;You&#146;re friend doesn&#146;t say much does she?&quot; Kevin asked nodding to Fujin.

Quistis looked over her shoulder at her and waved. Fujin didn&#146;t respond, 
obviously lost in thought.

&quot;She&#146;s speaks her mind when she wants to.&quot; Quistis smiled.

&quot;How long have you two been friends?&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s kinda of a long story.&quot;

&quot;We have time.&quot;

&quot;To make it short. We used to not really think much of each other until 
recently.&quot;

&quot;Gotcha, she&#146;s cute is she single?&quot;

&quot;Why are you interested?&quot; Quistis laughed.

&quot;I&#146;ve my eye on someone else at the moment. I have a friend though I 
think she may like.&quot;

&quot;Oh really now? Let me ask her.&quot; Quistis giggled then turned to regard 
Fujin.

&quot;Hey Fu!&quot; She called.

Fujin focused and regarded her curiously.

&quot;Kev wants to know if you&#146;re single.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin answered in her typical deadpan manner.

&quot;Sorry she&#146;s taken.&quot; Quistis smiled broadly.

&quot;To bad.&quot; He shrugged.

&quot;So who is it?&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;Your friend?&quot;

&quot;Oh Zone.&quot;

&quot;Zone!?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

Quistis exploded into laughter.

&quot;What&#146;s wrong with Zone?&quot; Kevin frowned slightly.

&quot;Nothing, nothing at all. I owe him one actually, he helped me out big 
time a while back. Its just that, from what Rinoa tells me Zone likes 
anything with boobs.&quot;

&quot;There&#146;s more to him than that, he&#146;s just shy.&quot;

&quot;I remember.&quot;

&quot;So is the relationship serious, does he even have a chance. I think 
they&#146;d hit it off great.&quot;

Quistis turned around once more.

&quot;Fujin!?&quot;

&quot;WHAT!?&quot;

&quot;Is the relationship serious?&quot;

&quot;VERY.&quot;

&quot;There&#146;s your answer.&quot;

&quot;Oh well I tried.&quot; Kevin laughed.

&quot;I figured her liked Celest to be honest.&quot; Quistis commented.

&quot;He does.&quot;

&quot;Ask her, she&#146;s single.&quot;

&quot;I would but to be honest she kinda intimidates me.&quot;

&quot;Who Celest?!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, she was sizing me up something fierce when we met.&quot; He blushed 
slightly. Quistis laughed brightly.

&quot;She&#146;s very bold, one of those types who wears their emotions on their 
sleeves, she obviously likes you.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s what I&#146;m afraid of.&quot;

&quot;She&#146;s nice you should talk to her.&quot;

&quot;I thought we were talking about Zone? Besides, you know who I&#146;m 
interested in.&quot; He smiled placing his hand lightly on her thigh.

&quot;Um that&#146;s not a good idea... Look, we live so far apart and we both 
have careers.&quot; Quistis said hopping to her feet.

&quot;I can transfer. I talked to Cid, you guys need a few new teachers for 
the junior classmen.&quot;

&quot;Well, you&#146;ve been busy.&quot; Quistis laughed nervously.

&quot;Look, I&#146;ve been thinking about you ever since I left.&quot;

&quot;Kevin...&quot; Quistis sighed in protest.

&quot;At least hear me out, you&#146;ve been dodging all day.&quot;

&quot;Kevin I don&#146;t think this is the right time. This seems a little spur of 
the moment.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m not asking for anything, I just want you to think about it. I&#146;m 
here for you. We always were good together.&quot; He smiled handsomely.

Quistis frowned. Pressured into a corner she tried desperately to think 
of a diplomatic way out. Thankfully Fujin, whether by design or accident 
solved the dilemma as the sound of crashing branches and a loud curse 
signaled her undignified exit from the tree she&#146;d been occupying.

Quistis turned just in time to see her disappear among a sea of bushes 
and shrubs.

&quot;Fu!?&quot; Quistis shouted and jogged over to where she fell.

&quot;Hyne is she okay?&quot; Kevin asked worriedly as Quistis helped her scuffed 
and battered friend to her feet.

&quot;FINE.&quot; Fujin grumbled, brushing herself off.

&quot;What hell happened?&quot; Quistis grinned, picking brambles from Fujin&#146;s 
hair.

&quot;SLIPPED.&quot;

&quot;You okay, we can run you to the clinic if you want.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re a mess.&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;That was some fall.&quot; Kevin whistled looking up at the tree. Fujin gave 
him a somewhat sour look.

&quot;What say we go inside?&quot; Quistis suggested.

&quot;Yeah sure.&quot; Kevin shrugged, realizing he&#146;d have to wait to continue 
their conversation. &quot;So, Fujin is it?&quot; He grinned. &quot;Tell me about 
yourself.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Oh come on.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Err...&quot; He frowned and turned to Quistis. &quot;Why does she talk like 
that?&quot; He whispered.

&quot;It&#146;s just her way.&quot; Quistis smirked.

&quot;Fair enough then. So Fujin?&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin sighed in annoyance.

&quot;You seem a little high-strung. I know some great stress therapy 
techniques.&quot; He prattled on as they made their way inside.

*******

&quot;Ante up boys.&quot; Celest laughed brightly, throwing a handful of coins 
onto the center of the table.

&quot;The woman is certifiable.&quot; Xu mumbled grimly from behind her cards then 
matched the wager.

&quot;I could&#146;ve told you that.&quot; Zell sighed, tossing down his cards. &quot;I&#146;m 
out, that&#146;s to rich for me.&quot;

&quot;You just gotta learn to read the ladies.&quot; Irvine smiled hugely, raising 
the bet.

&quot;You can read?&quot; Nicole giggled, tossing in her coins.

&quot;Why is I think you&#146;re all cheating.&quot; Rinoa pouted, throwing in her 
cards.

&quot;Don&#146;t worry Ma&#146;am we&#146;ll get you&#146;re money back.&quot; Watts smiled, tossing 
in the last vestiges of his coins.

Zone had to drop out of the game after Celest set off his ulcer with a 
combination of bluffing and flirting that left him in a moaning heap 
atop Zell&#146;s couch.

&quot;Is he gonna be alright?&quot; Celest asked worriedly.

&quot;Yeah, he gets like that around the ladies.&quot; Watts whispered.

&quot;I do not! I just have an ulcer.&quot; Zone yelled between moans.

&quot;It&#146;s okay man, calm down.&quot; Nida laughed from his seat near the 
television, having lost his money hours ago.

Selphie stormed into the apartment in a huff and sat down firmly in 
Irvine&#146;s lap.

&quot;Oh don&#146;t knock or shut the door or anything.&quot; Zell growled, getting up 
and shutting the door.

&quot;What&#146;s wrong with you?&quot; Irvine asked curiously.

&quot;I ran into Seifer.&quot; Selphie grumbled, then looked at his cards and 
winced.

&quot;I raise.&quot; Watts announced quickly.&quot; A moment later Irvine tossed in his 
cards then looked at Selphie dryly.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; He smirked. &quot;So what happened?&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t want to talk about.&quot;

&quot;All that huff and puff and you don&#146;t want to talk about it.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Well then go check out the bags on the couch.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;I got you something.&quot;

&quot;Oh goodie.&quot; Selphie giggled hopping up to investigate, only to jump 
back in terror as something hissed and jostled about inside one of the 
bags. A small cat-sized reptile with gossamer wings burst out of the 
bag, in its mouth it held the chewed remains of a small box. Selphie 
shrieked startling everyone including the small dragon, which promptly 
screeched in return and that only served to exasperate the problem. With 
a yell Selphie yanked her shoe off and flung it at the critter before 
running to hide behind Irvine.

&quot;Nicole get you&#146;re monster!&quot; She screamed.

&quot;Aw geeze, here we go.&quot; Zell groaned as the little beast went into a fit 
and started flying around the apartment like an enraged hornet.

&quot;What the hell is that!&quot; Zone belched, flinging himself off the cough 
and onto the floor.

&quot;I&#146;ll get it.&quot; Watts said eagerly, hoping to help.

&quot;Hold on hero.&quot; Xu laughed, grabbing him by the collar as he stood.

&quot;Oh, oh, oh. You scared her.&quot; Nicole frowned in dismay as she tried to 
corral the creature. &quot;Come here Ica.&quot; She cooed reaching for it gently.

She&#146;d just about got the tiny dragon under control when Quistis and 
company rushed through the door.

&quot;What happened we heard yelling!&quot; Quistis shouted. The commotion 
startled the dragon once more and it made a beeline straight at the 
startled instructor. Fujin shoved her out of the way as Ica tore past.

Kevin was just entering the room when the two ran into each other. He 
only had a moment to sound a cry of alarm before the panicked reptile 
attached itself firmly to his face.</pre>
