By the time Quistis was done the sum of their shopping excursion clocked 
in at six dresses, four pairs of shoes, several bottles of perfume, and 
a veritable plethora of scented oils, soaps, candles and lotions. And 
last but not least, a wide selection of steamy eveningwear, and the 
thing worried Fujin most was that Quistis bought most of it for her.

&#147;HORDE.&#148; She mouthed, from behind a tall bag.

&#147;Okay I admit I went over board, but you&#146;re worth it.&#148;

&#147;SUCH A FUSS.&#148;

&#147;Pardon?&#148;

&#147;NOT WORTH IT.&#148;

&#147;Nonsense.&#148; Quistis paused, turning to face her with a slight scowl. 
Walking over, she leaned close, causing Fujin to lean back slightly 
under her scrutiny.

&#147;DIDN&#146;T NEED TOO.&#148;

&#147;I didn&#146;t do it cause I needed too, I did cause I care.&#148;

&#147;CARE FOR SELF.&#148;

&#147;Yes, yes I know, I&#146;ve heard it all before.&#148; Quistis nagged playfully, 
tapping a finger against the tip of Fujin&#146;s nose.

&#147;That&#146;s how it works in a relationship, if you haven&#146;t noticed.&#148;

&#147;BUT.&#148;

&#147;No buts!&#148;

&#147;QUISTIS.&#148;

&#147;Ah! What did I say.&#148; Quistis snapped smilingly.

Fujin blushed but kept quiet. Quistis straightened approvingly then 
smiled softly.

&#147;Good. Now look, the way I see it. Considering all you&#146;ve been through, 
all you&#146;ve endured. I&#146;m of the opinion that you my dear; need to be 
spoiled.&#148; She stated matter-of-factly. Satisfied that Fujin wasn&#146;t going 
to argue, she hefted her bags slightly to get a better grip then turned. 
&#147;Now then lets hurry back and get changed; we&#146;ve a long night ahead.&#148; 
She said with a wry smile. Fujin, giving herself to the moment, nodded 
obediently and followed.

 Back in their room, Fujin went to freshen up and change while Quistis 
put away their things. She&#146;d just finished when a small squeak of shock 
echoed from the bathroom.

 Worried, Quistis walked over to the door and rapped quietly.

&#147;Fu? You okay in there?&#148;

&#147;TOO TIGHT!&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;OUTFIT.&#148;

&#147;You didn&#146;t complain earlier.&#148;

&#147;WAS RUSHED.&#148;

&#147;Oh for the love of... Come out and let me see.&#148;

&#147;NEGATIVE.&#148;

&#147;Fu, we&#146;ve had this discussion countless times, before, you look fine.&#148;

&#147;PEOPLE STARE.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s kinda of the point.&#148;

&#147;NOT WHAT MEAN!&#148;

&#147;Fujin.&#148;

&#147;NOT GOING.&#148;

&#147;Yes you are.&#148;

&#147;NO NOT.&#148;

&#147;Fujin!&#148;

&#147;IS BULGY.&#148;

&#147;Duh, it&#146;s called cleavage, it&#146;s a good thing, now would you come on!&#148;

&#147;FEEL SILLY.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re the one who picked it out!&#148;

&#147;HOPED YOU LIKED.&#148;

&#147;I do, but not that you&#146;d know it since you insist hiding.&#148;

&#147;YOU&#146;LL LAUGH.&#148;

&#147;You know better than that!&#148; Quistis sputtered, stamping her foot 
angrily.

&#147;NOW MAD.&#148; Fujin whined.

&#147;Ugh, not yet, but I&#146;m getting there. Don&#146;t make me come in there and 
drag you out.&#148;

Fujin made a noise of distress and Quistis rolled her eyes.

&#147;Well, I guess I&#146;ll have to go alone then.&#148; She sighed. &#147;Who knows what 
will happen then, some stranger will come and try to sweep me off my 
feet in my time of need, while you sit up here hiding from the world.&#148;

 The bathroom door clicked and Fujin stuck her head out sourly.

&#147;NOT STUPID.&#148; She frowned, not appreciating Quistis&#146; attempt at mind 
games.

&#147;Ah Ha!&#148; Quistis giggled, and lunged for her.

&#147;HEY!&#148; Fujin blurted, trying to shut the door.

&#147;No you don&#146;t you tease! Get your butt out here!&#148; Quistis ordered, 
yanking her bodily out the door.

Fujin spun around somewhat off balance then put both hands on her hips 
in annoyance.

&#147;HURT!&#148;

&#147;Want me to kiss it and make it better then?&#148; Quistis giggled, leaning 
back against the door appreciatively. &#147;Now that&#146;s much better.&#148; She 
purred, taking in the sights. Fujin looked stunning; the dress she 
fretted over was a sleek, black, two-piece affair. The upper portion 
consisted of form hugging halter that showed off her well-toned 
shoulders and midriff, connected to long wispy sleeves. While the lower 
portion, a tight, modest length skirt, rode tastefully low on her hips, 
held in place by a matching, slender belt.

 Her dislike for heels prompted her to go for a stylish pair boots and 
the entire ensemble topped off by a black choker.

&#147;STRIPPER.&#148; Fujin huffed, folding her arms.

&#147;Please, you&#146;re too grumpy to be a stripper.&#148; Quistis chuckled, 
sauntering towards her. &#147;You look fine, but if you&#146;re not comfortable 
then don&#146;t wear it. It&#146;s easy as that.&#148; She smiled, kissing her gently 
on the lips.

&#147;BE MAD...&#148; Fujin pouted, rubbing her eye with her palm.

&#147;No I won&#146;t silly, I just didn&#146;t want you sulking in the bathroom all 
night. Look, I&#146;ll tell you what, I&#146;ll order something nice, have it 
delivered and we&#146;ll just spend some quiet time alone. How&#146;s that sound?&#148;

&#147;FEEL SILLY.&#148; Fujin sighed, sitting on the bed.

&#147;What, Why?&#148;

&#147;ACTING SELFISH.&#148;

Her expression saddening, Quistis sat down and gave her a comforting 
hug.

&#148;Not at all, you&#146;re just out of your element; it&#146;s okay, really. The 
whole reason I brought you here was to have good time.&#148; She explained 
warmly.

&#147;I AM.&#148; Fujin mumbled quietly.

&#147;Are you sure?&#148; Quistis asked skeptically. Fujin gave a brisk nod then 
rose.

&#147;WE GO.&#148; She said firmly.

&#147;What, where?&#148;

&#147;OUT.&#148;

&#147;But I though we were ordering in?&#148;

&#147;IS OKAY.&#148; Fujin assured her with a reassuring smile.

&#147;No.&#148; Quistis said softly.

&#147;PARDON?&#148;

&#147;Come here.&#148; Quistis murmured, pulling her onto her lap.

&#147;WHAT?&#148;

&#147;We&#146;re not going anywhere.&#148;

&#147;BUT YOU...&#148;

&#147;No.&#148; Quistis said again, nuzzling gently against her neck.

&#147;QUISTIS?&#148; Fujin murmured.

&#147;You&#146;ve been through enough today. I&#146;m sorry.&#148;

&#147;FOR WHAT?&#148;

&#147;Dragging you around, when all you wanted was some peace and quiet.&#148;

&#147;IS OKAY.&#148; Fujin blushed, brushing the hair from her face absently.

&#147;No it&#146;s not, this is supposed to be your vacation, and here I go making 
you do things I want to do.&#148;

&#147;FOOLISHNESS.&#148;

&#147;No it&#146;s not and you&#146;re just too sweet to say otherwise.&#148; Quistis 
grinned, rubbing her nose against hers cutely.

Fujin felt downright silly at the gesture and giggled.

&#147;NOT SWEET.&#148; She mumbled, in a failed attempt at her token gruffness.

&#147;I like to hear you laugh.&#148; Quistis smiled fondly.

&#147;AWKWARD.&#148;

&#147;Not at all.&#148;

&#147;IF SAY SO.&#148;

&#147;I do.&#148; Quistis winked, motioning for her to get up then rising herself.

&#147;DOING?&#148; Fujin asked curiously as she moved to the phone.

&#147;We&#146;re ordering in.&#148;

&#147;DON&#146;T HAVE TOO.&#148;

&#147;Hush.&#148;

&#147;APOLOGIZE.&#148;

&#147;Stop that.&#148; Quistis snapped, looking through the resort&#146;s phonebook.

&#147;NO FUN.&#148; Fujin sighed sadly.

&#147;Yes you are, now what do you want to eat.&#148;

&#147;UNKNOWN.&#148;

&#147;Personally I feel like junk food, you and Kadowaki tried to kill me 
with that damned dietary regiment.&#148;

&#147;RESTORED STRENGTH.&#148; Fujin noted.

&#147;I know, I know, still, I could go for something sinful.&#148;

&#147;CINNAMON ROLLS.&#148; Fujin blurted eagerly then sat back on the bed with a 
giggle.

&#147;It&#146;s a little late for that, don&#146;t you think?&#148; Quistis laughed.

&#147;SO.&#148;

&#147;Okay then.&#148; Quistis shrugged, making a note as she continued browsing 
menus and the like. Hoping back up, Fujin scampered to the closet and 
pried herself out of her outfit while Quistis started called room 
service. Throwing on a baggy t-shirt with Balamb&#146;s insignia and her mog 
slippers, Fujin flung herself onto the bed then sat up cross-legged.

&#147;EGG ROLLS!&#148; She chirped.

Quistis made a disgusted face but didn&#146;t argue.

&#147;ICE CREAM.&#148; Fujin piped in once more. &#147;LIME!&#148;

This time Quistis paused then shook her head. Covering the phone&#146;s 
mouthpiece she gave her a scornful look. &#147;I don&#146;t think so; you know 
good and well Ice Cream makes you gassy.&#148;

&#147;DOES NOT!&#148; Fujin gaped, shocked and insulted.

&#147;Un huh, you forget I sleep next to you.&#148;

&#147;NOT FUNNY.&#148;

&#147;No it&#146;s not.&#148; Quistis said straight-faced. &#147;Besides, since when did you 
develop a sweet tooth, you&#146;re going to kill yourself.&#148;

&#147;VACATION.&#148;

&#147;Yeah, but, come on, ice cream and egg rolls, who does that?&#148; A garbled 
voice babbled from the phone and Quistis winced then resumed her order.

&#147;Um sorry, I&#146;m back.&#148; She giggled, cutting Fujin a skeptical look.

&#147;NOT GASSY.&#148; Fujin mumbled under her breath, picking up the resort&#146;s 
flier and browsing through it.

&#147;Hush.&#148; Quistis waved at her. &#147;No not you.&#148; She apologized to the man on 
the phone. Having decided that Fujin had gone mad, Quistis finished the 
order without consulting her further. Once completed, she sat the phone 
down then joined her on the bed.

&#147;WELL?&#148; Fujin asked, looking up curiously.

&#147;I placed the order; they&#146;ll be up as soon as they can.&#148;

&#147;GOOD.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re in a frisky mood all of a sudden?&#148;

&#147;AM I?&#148; Fujin shrugged, still glancing over the brochure.

&#147;Yes you are.&#148; Quistis smirked, falling backwards onto the bed to stare 
at the ceiling.

&#147;THINKING?&#148;

&#147;Nothing really.&#148;

&#147;LOOK.&#148; Fujin said curiously. Lying on her stomach by Quistis&#146; side as 
she offered Quistis the brochure.

&#147;Zero gravity meditative chamber?&#148; Quistis read aloud.

&#147;COMES WITH ROOM.&#148;

&#147;I didn&#146;t see anything like that when we came in.&#148;

&#147;FIND?&#148;

&#147;Sure, why not, it&#146;ll give us something to do till the food arrives.&#148;

With that the two bounded off in search for the elusive room, which was 
simply at the end of the hall, appearing much like any other room in the 
suite, except equipped with cushioned walls and ceiling. Poking her head 
in the room Fujin didn&#146;t notice anything amiss but didn&#146;t dare step in.

 &#147;Just go in.&#148; Quistis giggled.

&#147;FALL.&#148;

&#147;No you won&#146;t it&#146;s supposed to be Zero G.&#148;

Tentatively Fujin stepped into the room, one foot at a time and holding 
onto the doorframe firmly.

&#147;GRAVITY HERE?&#148;

&#147;Of course there is.&#148; Quistis laughed, slipping past her into the round, 
dimly lit chamber. &#147;A small ring of cushioned seats sat against the 
walls and sitting on one lay a manual and remote control.

&#147;See, you probably control it with this.&#148; Quistis explained holding the 
remote. With that, she casually pushed a couple of buttons.

&#147;QUISTIS!&#148; Fujin blurted as the soft hum created by the gravity 
generators slowly died down. Moments later the two of them drifted up 
slightly. Despite her best intentions Fujin was well on her way to 
spinning upside down. Casually Quistis grabbed her collar to steady her.

&#147;This brings back memories.&#148; She giggled.

&#147;NOT FUNNY.&#148; Fujin huffed.

&#147;I beg to differ&#148; Quistis winked then turned the generators back on, 
causing the two to slowly drift back to the ground.

&#147;INTERESTING.&#148; Fujin commented thoughtfully, taking the instructions 
with her as they exited. Quistis, in a somewhat playful mood leaned 
heavily against her as they walked.

&#147;STOP.&#148; Fujin smirked, trying to read.

&#147;Oh am I annoying you?&#148; Quistis said dryly then snatched the booklet 
from Fujin&#146;s grasp.

&#147;DESIST.&#148; Fujin complained.

&#147;Make me.&#148; Quistis giggled, holding the manual overhead.

Fujin made a perturbed face and hopped lightly in an attempt to take it 
back. The attempt failed and Quistis beamed teasingly.

&#147;Come on, you can do better than that.&#148;

Fujin arched a brow then tackled her. With a yelp of surprise, Quistis 
fell back onto the floor with Fujin sitting atop her.

&#147;Hey, that hurt.&#148; Quistis laughed. Fujin pinned her arms and smiled down 
wryly.

&#147;TAUNTING.&#148;

&#147;Please, like you never picked on me before.&#148; Quistis laughed, biting up 
at her with a catty smile.

&#147;HAVE I?&#148; Fujin murmured quietly.

&#147;Yes you have.&#148; Quistis pouted.

&#147;RESTITUTION.&#148;

&#147;Oh you know I like when it when you talk dirty.&#148; Quistis giggled.

Fujin couldn&#146;t help but laugh at that. A knock on the door ended their 
moment of mirth. Both looked at the door in annoyance.

&#147;This is security, someone reported a yell.&#148; A mans voice echoed from 
beyond the door.

&#147;You have to be kidding.&#148; Quistis mouthed, wide eyed.

&#147;YOUR FAULT.&#148; Fujin grumbled, letting her up.

&#147;You&#146;re the one who attacked me.&#148; Quistis nagged, heading to the door. 
Opening it, she came face to face with two imposing figures.

&#147;Everything okay Ma&#146;am.&#148; The first guard asked curiously.

&#147;No.&#148; Quistis pouted, pointing to Fujin who stood behind her curiously.

&#147;She&#146;s being mean to me. Throw her in the brig or something.&#148;

&#147;WHAT!?&#148; Fujin barked in shock.

 The two men looked at each other then rolled their eyes.

&#147;Um, you two have a good night.&#148; The first man sighed then mumbled 
something into his walkie-talkie. Quistis shut the door then spun around 
to confront Fujin.

&#147;Come here!&#148; She blurted then reached out with every intention of 
tickling her.

&#147;FIEND.&#148; Fujin babbled, trying to keep her at bay. The war had only just 
begun when another knock sounded.

&#147;Oh for the love of.&#148; Quistis sighed, turning back to the door. Opening 
it, she found a pimply-faced teen staring at her.

&#147;Who?&#148; She asked sourly.

&#147;Room Service Ma&#146;am.&#148; The youth said with a crackly voice, pointing to 
the pushcart at his side.

&#147;MUNCHIES.&#148; Fujin chirped; causing Quistis too look at her 
incredulously.

&#147;Munchies...?&#148; She whispered curiously as the youth pushed the cart 
inside.

&#147;HUNGRY.&#148; Fujin amended, resuming her normally gruff tone.

The teen, obviously in the awkward stages of adolescence, developed an 
annoying habit of staring at Fujin while unloading the cart. That is, 
until she noticed and gave him a glare so incendiary that it could&#146;ve 
melted steel.

&#147;Here&#146;s your tip.&#148; Quistis said hurriedly, shoving the money in the 
youths hand and all but shoving him out the door.

&#147;RUDE.&#148;

&#147;Sorry.&#148;

&#147;NOT YOU.&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148;

&#147;STARING.&#148;

&#147;We&#146;ll that&#146;s only because you&#146;re so cute.&#148;

Fujin didn&#146;t respond to the comment and settled for peeking at what 
delicacies Quistis ordered.

&#147;FEAST!?&#148; She gawked.

&#147;Okay I admit it I went a little over board.&#148; Quistis giggled, sorting 
through the entrees. Spotting her sweet rolls and ice cream, Fujin 
daintily helped herself then looked around.

&#147;WHERE DINE?&#148;

&#147;Good question.&#148; Quistis frowned, looking around then pointed. &#147;This 
way.&#148; She explained, pushing the cart towards an elegant, engraved 
wooden door.

The door was of the swinging variety and opened with ease. The dining 
room was large, easily capable of comfortably sitting a dozen people at 
the long, richly varnished table.

&#147;BIG.&#148; Fujin blinked, her voice echoing through the chamber.

&#147;Um...yeah.&#148; Quistis mouthed.

&#147;OVERDID SUITE?&#148; Fujin smirked, folding her arms expectantly.

&#147;Okay, maybe a little. Perhaps we didn&#146;t need this much.&#148; Quistis 
blushed.

 After a brief moment of deliberation, the two of them found themselves 
sitting atop their bed. With plates at their side and a throng of 
playing cards divided between them they quickly got caught up in variety 
of games.

 After a torturous string of losing hands, Quistis finally looked up 
thoughtfully.

&#147;Want to see a trick?&#148;

&#147;LOSE AGAIN?&#148; Fujin chuckled.

&#147;Cute.&#148; Quistis sneered snobbishly then grinned. &#147;Seriously, watch 
this.&#148;

&#147;VERY WELL.&#148; Fujin agreed; scooping up the cards and putting them neatly 
back in their package. Quistis made herself comfortable then focused 
intently on the cards. Fujin looked between the two curiously.

&#147;PROBLEM?&#148;

&#147;Shush.&#148; Quistis murmured, then the cards began to glow.

&#147;NO GUARDIANS.&#148; Fujin scolded her instantly.

The cards shuttered slightly the dimmed, causing Quistis to look up in 
aggravation.

&#147;You distracted me.&#148;

&#147;KADOWAKI ORDERED.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t have any with me.&#148; Quistis sighed. &#147;It&#146;s my blue magic.&#148;

&#147;NEW?&#148;

&#147;In a way.&#148;

&#147;NOT STRESSED?&#148;

&#147;I know. That&#146;s what&#146;s new.&#148;

&#147;WORRIED...&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t be, I feel fine. I&#146;ve been practicing with it, I&#146;ve gotten to 
where I can lift small things if I concentrate.&#148;

&#147;TELEKINESIS?&#148;

&#147;Similar I guess. I&#146;ve been thinking about what Edea said.&#148;

&#147;EXPLAIN?&#148; Fujin prodded, still worried.

&#147;I have the blood of a sorceress in my veins, so there&#146;s no reason I 
shouldn&#146;t be able to call upon those powers whenever. Therefore, I&#146;ve 
been training in secret.&#148;

&#147;HIDING FROM ME!?&#148; Fujin said quietly, hurt.

&#147;No, I was just wanted to surprise you.&#148;

&#147;SUCCEEDED.&#148;

&#147;Calm down, the only thing that&#146;s changed is that I&#146;ve gotten more 
control of my abilities.&#148;

&#147;WARY.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m being careful.&#148;

&#147;EXTENT?&#148;

&#147;Well, I&#146;ve tried a few things, nothing really new yet but the so called 
Telekinesis as you put it.&#148;

&#147;LOW POWERED.&#148; Fujin noted bluntly.

&#147;You come try it then.&#148; Quistis snapped slightly. &#147;I happen to be pretty 
proud of what I&#146;ve accomplish.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;M PROUD.&#148; Fujin nodded quickly.

&#147;Thank you.&#148; Quistis smiled, feeling somewhat better.

&#147;STILL CARDS THOUGH.&#148; Fujin commented cattily with a sarcastic grin.

&#147;Keep playing around.&#148; Quistis scolded lightly, wagging a finger at her.

***********************

When the next morning arrived, Quistis awoke to find Fujin missing. 
Sitting up groggily she looked about curiously.

&#147;Fu?&#148; She called out hoarsely, running a hand through the tangled mess 
of her hair.

&#147;Fujin?&#148; She called again when no answer was forthcoming.

A quick glance to the nightstand revealed a note propped up on the 
clock. The note was simple and cute, explaining that Fujin had left to 
do some early shopping and would be back soon. The bottom of the message 
was adorned with a crude but cute doodle of a mog with ruffled hair, eye 
patch, a silly smile and little hearts circling around its head.

Quistis giggled at the picture then stood stretched before heading 
towards the shower.

*******************

Fujin&#146;s browsing led her to a small gift shop with various trinkets and 
baubles. Normally she was not given to buying such things but she could 
not however resist looking over the wide selection of mog related 
paraphernalia, it was her one weakness. Not feeling like drawing any 
undo attention due to her appearance. She wore a simple blue sweater 
jacket with the hood drawn, which, unbeknownst to her drew even more 
attention. Her attire and her stiff mannerism marked her as a shoplifter 
to the store&#146;s management and they where watching her like a hawk. 
Ignoring them, she picked up a small, plush mog dressed in a spacesuit 
and holding a little flag with the stations emblem.

Smirking to herself, she put it into the small shopping basket she 
carried and moved on. As she rounded a display case a sour looking old 
man stepped in her path.

&#147;Can I help you?&#148; He said with a slightly condescending tone.

&#147;NO, GO AWAY.&#148; Fujin grumbled, squeezing past him.

&#147;I beg your pardon young lady?&#148; The man frowned, giving her a suspicious 
look.

&#147;NOT THIEF.&#148; Fujin explained, not even looking his way as she studied a 
pair of fluffy house shoes.

&#147;I never said anything of the such.&#148; The man said icily folding his 
arms.

&#147;THINKING IT.&#148;

&#147;Now see here. Keep your voice down, I will tolerate such behavior in my 
store.&#148;

&#147;Quit harassing her you old stooge.&#148; A young woman huffed walking over 
to them. Short, attractive and dressed in clothes befitting a librarian, 
she wore her long black hair in tight ponytail. Her dark eyes, flashed 
behind a demure pair of glasses as she strode over and put her hands on 
her hips. Pointing up at the man sternly, he back stepped slightly.

&#147;Miss Jennings.&#148; The man stammered slightly. &#147;Excuse me, but I do not 
believe this is any of your concern.&#148;

&#147;I think it is. Mr. Hammonds, my father owns this station and from what 
I hear, he&#146;s sick of getting customer complaints about your attitude. 
Also, if I may be so bold to say so, I&#146;m sure it&#146;d be in your best 
interest to see that he doesn&#146;t receive another.&#148; She said with the tone 
of a spoiled girl, used to getting her way.

&#147;I...&#148; The man started, then snapped silent. Giving one more glance to 
Fujin, who stood somewhat dumbfounded, he turned on his heels and 
stormed off.

&#147;Stuffy old jerk.&#148; The girl giggled brightly then offered a friendly 
hand to Fujin.

&#147;Naomi Jennings.&#148; She smiled, introducing herself.

Fujin looked at her hand a moment then shook it grudgingly.

&#147;FUJIN.&#148; She mumbled, returning the introduction.

&#147;Fujin, an odd name, are you from the southern islands?&#148;

&#147;NEGATIVE.&#148;

&#147;Just curious.&#148; Naomi shrugged; then nodded to the manager glaring at 
them from behind the counter. &#147;Ignore him, he hates young people.&#148;

&#147;NOTICED.&#148;

&#147;You just arrived last night didn&#146;t you?&#148;

&#147;WHY?&#148;

&#147;No reason, I&#146;m just making conversation. You&#146;re a jumpy sort aren&#146;t 
you?&#148;

&#147;GOOD BYE.&#148; Fujin groaned, then started towards the register.

&#147;Wait, hold on a moment.&#148; Naomi giggled, catching up with her. &#147;No need 
to be that way, I&#146;m just trying to make up for his rudeness.&#148; She 
explained quickly.

&#147;NO NEED.&#148; Fujin said guardedly, putting her basket on the counter to be 
ringed up.

&#147;Yes there is, here let me.&#148; Naomi said cheerfully, slipping a card from 
her purse.

&#147;HEY!?&#148; Fujin began protesting, but the girl would have none of it.

&#147;I&#146;m paying, that&#146;s all there is to it.&#148;

&#147;PAY MYSELF.&#148; Fujin assured her, holding out her own card.

&#147;I&#146;m sure you can.&#148; The girl nodded then pushed Fujin&#146;s arm down and all 
but tossed her card to the clerk. &#147;Charge theses things to my account 
please.&#148; She said firmly. With a shrug, the clerk did as he was told and 
quietly bagged the items.

&#147;There you go Miss Fujin.&#148; She waved, backing up to leave.

&#147;UNNECESSARY.&#148; Fujin frowned.

&#147;Yes it was.&#148; The girl winked then headed towards the exit. &#147;See you 
around I hope.&#148; She called over her shoulder, and then was gone.

Fujin stood stupefied, then looked at the clerk who was giving her a 
curious look.

&#147;WHAT LOOKING AT?&#148; She barked, and then strode towards the door, where 
she quickly paused then rushed back to retrieve her bag.
