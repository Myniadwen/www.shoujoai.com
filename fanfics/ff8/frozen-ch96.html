With a duffel bag over her shoulder and a burst of childish energy Fujin 
raced up Ragnarok&#146;s gangplank and vanished inside. Zell, who was almost 
run down as he exited, followed her with curious eyes before looking 
back to Quistis who made her way casually towards him.

&#147;What the heck was that about?&#148; He asked curiously.

&#147;She&#146;s excited.&#148; Quistis shrugged simply.

&#147;She&#146;s crazy you know that.&#148;

&#147;I know and I love it.&#148; Quistis said with a small smile playing at her 
lips.

&#147;I bet you do, lets get out of here, before we miss our window.&#148; He 
chuckled, taking her bag for her. &#147;Here, I&#146;ll get that.&#148;

&#147;Thanks.&#148; Quistis bowed politely, following him up the ramp.

Once the luggage was stored, Zell hurried to the bridge and was startled 
to find Fujin sitting at the helm.

&#147;PREPARE, LAUNCH.&#148;

&#147;Like hell.&#148; Zell scoffed. &#147;Get out of my seat.&#148;
Fujin ignored him.

&#147;Miss Trepe.&#148; Zell whined, looking forlorn at Quistis who was buckling 
herself into her seat.

&#147;Don&#146;t look at me.&#148; She grinned. With an annoyed sigh, Zell turned to 
regard Fujin once more.

&#147;Out!&#148; He said firmly, only to be ignored again. Instead, Fujin began 
the ship&#146;s start up sequence.

&#147;Hey, hey, hey, stop that, there is no way I&#146;m letting you fly right 
now.&#148;

&#147;CERTIFIED.&#148; Fujin announced, holding up her card proudly.

&#147;Yeah, but only for atmospheric flights, not space.&#148; Zell noted.

&#147;HAVE TRAINED.&#148; Fujin responded, starting the ships engines. Zell once 
again looked back at Quistis for help.

&#147;Talk to her, please.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re the one that trained her, why do you think she wanted to learn.&#148; 
Quistis chuckled as the ship began to hover.

&#147;Hey whoa!&#148; Zell blurted, pulling Fujin&#146;s arm. Ever since Quistis 
recovery, she had been resuming her workouts and his attempts to muscle 
her out of the chair were less than successful.

&#147;Girl you weight a ton.&#148; He grunted, as she refused to be moved.

&#147;RUDE.&#148; She noted, and then slapped him casually across the mouth.

Quistis exploded into merry laughter at the sight and settled back to 
enjoy the show. Shocked, Zell sat in the co pilots&#146; seat without another 
word.

 &#147;Never comment on a lady&#146;s weight.&#148;  Quistis explained laughingly.

Pushing the throttle forward, the Ragnarok exited the hanger with little 
fuss. The radio crackled to life with Nida&#146;s voice.

&#147;Ragnarok, you&#146;re clear for departure.&#148;

&#147;AFFIRMATIVE.&#148; Fujin replied, as she went over her final checklist.

&#147;You girls try not to get into any trouble.&#148; Xu&#146;s voice said laughingly.

&#147;Bye Xu!&#148; Quistis shouted merrily.

&#147;LIFTING OFF.&#148; Fujin announced, having finished her preparations; with 
that said, she brought the ship&#146;s engines to full power. With a 
tremendous roar, the engines flared to life and propelled the craft 
upwards at a breathtaking speed.

 As the ship careened through the clouds, Fujin&#146;s expression was one of 
wonder and exuberance, Quistis watched her quietly, a look of loving 
pride in her eyes. Fujin had come so far from being the angry young 
woman she&#146;d known just years before. The blue haze of the atmosphere 
soon gave way to the inky star filled blackness of space and Fujin felt 
the sensation of weightlessness take hold.

&#147;I hope you get sick.&#148; Zell snorted from his seat.

&#147;You&#146;d just have to fly back with it in the air.&#148; Quistis noted.

&#147;LOOK.&#148; Fujin said quietly, pointing to a large object floating in amid 
blinking lights in the far distance.

&#147;Edea...&#148; Zell mumbled.

&#147;NOT EDEA.&#148; Fujin corrected him firmly.

&#147;They finally finished the containment.&#148; Quistis sighed. The structure 
was a massive part of a military facility. Covered in heavy black, 
composite metal plates and loaded down with sever weaponry, it looked 
like a black, demonic starfish, ready to fend off anyone trying to free 
the insane guardian force trapped within.

&#147;They put it up not to long ago.&#148; Zell said with a scowl. &#147;It sucks you 
to know that one day he&#146;ll get free again.&#148;

&#147;Someday.&#148; Quistis sighed. &#147;But not in our lifetime.&#148;

&#147;DEPRESSING.&#148; Fujin frowned, turning the ship away from the sight as 
they continued their journey.

&#147;So.&#148; Zell said, kicking back in his seat. &#147;You girls have any plans 
while you are up here?&#148;

&#147;Nope, just to have fun.&#148; Quistis grinned.

&#147;Squall says they have an awesome lounge and live shows.&#148;

&#147;STRIPPERS?&#148; Fujin scowled.

&#147;No, not strippers, what do I look like, Irvine?&#148;

&#147;Thanks Zell, we&#146;ll look into it.&#148; Quistis giggled.

Moments later, the Grandia loomed into view. The solar arrays, covering 
the hull of the establishment made the entire station glimmer in 
gemstone hues of blue and white.

&#147;CLOSING.&#148; Fujin noted, lining up the ship.

&#147;Just don&#146;t get us killed.&#148; Zell grumbled nervously.

The radio buzzed to life as the station&#146;s tower called to them.

&#147;Grandia to unidentified craft, what can we do for you?&#148;

&#147;DOCKING.&#148; Fujin blurted awkwardly.

&#147;I got it.&#148; Zell winced, switching on his headset. &#147;Grandia, this is the 
Ragnarok, I&#146;m just dropping off some customers, under Quistis Trepe and 
Fujin Kazeno.&#148;

&#147;Okay, checking, stay in quadrant four while we check it out.&#148;

&#147;Will do.&#148; Zell smirked, nodding to Fujin, who did as he ordered.

After a brief delay, the tower contacted them once more.

&#147;Ragnarok, everything checks out, proceed to Docking Bay Alpha Zero One. 
We&#146;ll have someone there to help with any baggage. Thank you for 
visiting The Grandia.&#148;

&#147;THANKS.&#148; Fujin said nodding appreciatively to Zell.

&#147;No prob.&#148; He yawned, kicking back in his seat. &#147;You okay to dock this 
thing?&#148;

&#147;AFFIRMATIVE.&#148; Fujin smirked, bringing the ship around to the port side 
of the station. Smaller craft darted to and fro along the hull of the 
station, performing maintenance and moving supplies from a large cargo 
freighter moored nearby. Fujin fly under the massive ship and pulled 
alongside a large docking arm.

&#147;Easy now...&#148; Zell mumbled as the arm loamed on their left side.

&#147;GOT IT.&#148; Fujin snapped, annoyed at the distraction.

Quistis tensed slightly, but had faith as the Ragnarok eased into 
position. The ship rocked slightly as they made contact and a loud clang 
signaled that the docking clamps had sealed correctly.

&#147;I&#146;ll be damned, on the first try too.&#148; Zell whistled.

&#147;THE BEST.&#148; Fujin said pointedly then unbuckled her belt.

&#147;Ah...&#148; Zell started but was to late. Having been focusing intently on 
flight and docking, Fujin failed to notice that she neglected to turn on 
the artificial gravity and the act of standing sent her careening 
upwards to clang her head against the cockpit window.

 Quistis and Zell both winced in sympathy as Fujin curled into a 
floating ball while holding her head.

&#147;Are you okay?&#148; Quistis giggled behind her hand.

Fujin made a growling noise as she spun lazily overhead.

&#147;I would have warned you, but being the best and all I figured you had 
it covered.&#148; Zell snickered. Fujin gave him the finger then pulled 
herself back into her seat. One safely settled anew she switched on the 
gravity generator.

 A slight hum filled the air as it took effect and Zell unbuckled his 
seatbelt.

Quistis stood as well as did Fujin who was looking more than a little 
perturbed.

&#147;Let me see.&#148; Quistis smiled, walking over to inspect her scalp.

&#147;FINE.&#148; Fujin assured her gruffly, waving her away.

&#147;Stop that.&#148; Quistis snapped motherly, swatting her hand away. &#147;Hold 
still.&#148; She ordered as she parted Fujin&#146;s hair gently. &#147;Ah yup, you&#146;re 
going to have a knot.&#148;

Zell chuckled quietly to himself as he started pulling free their bags.

&#147;SHUT UP.&#148; Fujin growled, picking up her bags angrily.

&#147;I didn&#146;t say anything.&#148; He smiled sarcastically.

&#147;Children, please.&#148; Quistis sighed, letting Zell carry her luggage.

They entered the airlock and waited calmly for it to cycle, after a 
brief moment the door opened with an audible whoosh. Walking into the 
docking area, the trio marveled at the care and artistic detail that 
went into the entire structure. It looked more like a royal palace than 
a resort and this was just the docking area. Fujin frowned in dismay and 
turned to face Quistis fretfully.

&#147;TOO EXPENSIVE.&#148; She mouthed.

&#147;Nonsense, you wanted to go and I&#146;m taking you.&#148; Quistis laughed.

Fujin made a noise and turned around breathless. Zell meanwhile 
struggled with the awkwardness of Quistis&#146; bags, a handful, even at less 
than normal gravity. A severe looking, older gentleman, dressed in a 
regal red and gold uniform walked up to them and bowed politely.

&#147;Welcome to the Grandia, I am Larz.&#148; He said with a thick accented and 
heavy voice.

&#147;Wooh, I am Larz...&#148; Zell mumbled mockingly under his breath.

Fujin back stepped slightly and slammed her heel into his foot causing 
him to snarl under his breath and hop about.

&#147;Stop it you two...&#148; Quistis said through a clenched smile.

&#147;I am here to take you&#146;re bags and show you to your room.&#148; Larz 
continued then blew a small whistle he withdrew from his vest-pocket. 
Immediately four youths appeared, dressed in similar clothes and bearing 
berets, they rushed forward and commandeered the luggage the trio 
carried.

&#147;Um thank you.&#148; Quistis smirked, then looked to Zell who, having removed 
his shoe, was rubbing his bare and somewhat odorous foot tenderly.

&#147;Zell...&#148; She said with a sigh. &#147;What!&#148; He snapped, cutting Fujin a sour 
look. Quistis arched a brow at him. &#147;Goodbye.&#148; She responded curtly as 
the man and his henchmen looked on disapprovingly.

&#147;Oh, um yeah...&#148; He laughed, blushing slightly. &#147;Um, well, ladies.&#148; He 
waved, sliding back on his shoe. &#147;I guess I&#146;ll see you later then.&#148; He 
waved, backing away.

&#147;Bye Zell, have a safe trip back.&#148; Quistis waved politely.

&#147;Of course.&#148; He smirked awkwardly then gave Fujin a rueful and foul 
smile. &#147;Bye.&#148; He said gruffly. Fujin, her back to the others, stuck her 
tongue out at him.

&#147;Oh, you...wait till...&#148; Zell scowled, pointing a finger at her.

&#147;Zell.&#148; Quistis said sharply.

&#147;Oh yeah, um see ya.&#148; He winced, turning around to rush back into the 
Ragnarok. Breathing a sigh of relief, Quistis turned back and offered an 
apologetic smile. &#147;Sorry, Larz was it?&#148;

&#147;Yes, Ma&#146;am.&#148;

&#147;Um, well, lead the way.&#148; She giggled, taking Fujin&#146;s arm in hers.

The walk to their rooms was interesting affair; they got many looks, 
though Fujin wasn&#146;t sure if it was because of Quistis&#146; beauty or the 
fact that they were holding hands, either way, she didn&#146;t care.

&#147;What are you thinking about?&#148; Quistis asked quietly.

Fujin shrugged causally, a soft smile on her lips.

&#147;You&#146;re adorable, you know that?&#148; Quistis grinned, kissing her lightly 
on the forehead.

&#147;BAH.&#148; Fujin huffed, halfheartedly.

&#147;Your room.&#148; Larz coughed, getting their attention.

Quistis stiffened and looked up to find their guides looking at them 
questioningly.

&#147;Oh.&#148; Quistis laughed nervously. &#147;Um thanks.&#148; She added meekly, making 
her way into the room.

&#147;HUGE!&#148; Fujin blurted, upon entering.

&#147;The royal suite, it is what you ordered correct?&#148; Larz commented as the 
bellboys, set their luggage down.

&#147;ROYAL SUITE!?&#148; Fujin blurted, noticing the small fountain in the middle 
of the entryway.

&#147;Surprise.&#148; Quistis giggled.

&#147;JOKING!?&#148;

&#147;Nope.&#148;

&#147;OUTRAGEOUS!&#148;

&#147;Yeah, isn&#146;t it fun.&#148;

&#147;CANNOT LET YOU.&#148;

&#147;Oh hush.&#148; Quistis waved absently then addressed Lars. &#147;Thank you sir.&#148; 
She smiled, laying a few bills in his hand and in those of the bellboys.

&#147;Anything else Madame?&#148;

&#147;Oh, he that Fu, I&#146;m officially a Madame now, does that mean I&#146;m old.&#148; 
She giggled. Fujin couldn&#146;t answer; instead she stood speechless in 
open-mouthed awe.

&#147;Well then.&#148; Quistis beamed cutely. &#147;Thank you Lars, that will be all.&#148;

&#147;Very well, do have a good evening.&#148; The tall man bowed then quickly 
left with the bellboys in tow.

&#147;IS PALACE.&#148; Fujin finally grumbled.

&#147;I know, it&#146;s massive, look, we even have an upstairs.&#148; Quistis giggled, 
running over to the curving staircase.

&#147;NO.&#148; Fujin gawked.

&#147;Yep.&#148; Quistis laughed brightly, running up the stairs.

Fujin stayed put, still shocked. There were marble statues, exquisite 
paintings, plush seats, and golden mirrors.

&#147;STATUE...&#148; Fujin mumbled.

&#147;And a hot tub!&#148; Quistis chirped.

&#147;FORTUNE.&#148;

&#147;So.&#148;

&#147;INSANE.&#148;

&#147;Live a little, besides, we deserve it, especially you.&#148; Quistis said 
brightly, leaning over the railing to peer down at her. Fujin looked up 
and smiled shyly.

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;THANK YOU.&#148;

&#147;For what?&#148; Quistis laughed, walking back down to her.

&#147;EVERYTHING.&#148; Fujin mumbled, stepping quietly into an embrace.

**************************

 It didn&#146;t take the two of them long to unpack and freshen up. Quistis 
slipped into a classy black skirt and white blouse, while Fujin opted 
for slacks and shirt of matching colors.

&#147;You look like a waiter.&#148; Quistis giggled.

&#147;COMFORTABLE.&#148; Fujin groused.

&#147;I&#146;m teasing, you look handsome.&#148;

&#147;NOT FUNNY.&#148; Fujin responded, shoving her playfully.

&#147;Where too?&#148; Quistis asked, looking over the brochure.

&#147;UNKNOWN.&#148;

&#147;Ohh they have a casino.&#148;

&#147;NEGATIVE.&#148;

&#147;Come on, I&#146;ve never been to a real one.&#148;

&#147;TRAP.&#148;
&#148;Of course it is; that&#146;s the point.&#148; Quistis giggled.

&#147;QUISTIS.&#148;

&#147;Fine, you poop.&#148; Quistis sighed, flipping through the pages.

&#147;Hmm, spa&#146;s, oh and a staff of qualified masseur and masseuses. How 
classy.&#148;

&#147;MA, WHAT?&#148; Fujin blinked.

&#147;People who give massages.&#148;

&#147;SHADY.&#148;

&#147;It is not.&#148; Quistis laughed.

&#147;FONDLE.&#148;

&#147;No, silly, its therapeutic.&#148;

&#147;PERVERTED.&#148;

&#147;Only you would think that.&#148;

&#147;IS TRUE.&#148;

&#147;All the time you spend in the gym and you never had a massage?&#148;

&#147;DIFFERENT.&#148;

&#147;Yes, these are for relaxation, not because you grunt around in a gym 
all day.&#148;

&#147;DON&#146;T GRUNT.&#148;

&#147;You know what I mean.&#148;

&#147;SOUNDS SHIFTY.&#148;

&#147;Shifty? You&#146;re shifty, you grouch. Come on, trust me, you&#146;ll like it.&#148;

&#147;WHO GIVES?&#148;

&#147;Up to you.&#148;

&#147;YOU.&#148;

&#147;Not me you clown, these folks are professionals.&#148;

&#147;STRANGERS.&#148;

&#147;So.&#148;

&#147;IS WEIRD.&#148;

&#147;A doctor is stranger, and they&#146;re worse.&#148;

&#147;KNOW KADOWAKI.&#148;

Quistis sputtered in frustration. &#147;You know what I mean, quit being 
difficult.&#148;

&#147;NAKED?&#148;

&#147;Sorta, depends on how much you want.&#148;

&#147;WHAT!?&#148;

&#147;Okay I admit, that sounded dirty.&#148;

&#147;NEGATIVE.&#148;

&#147;Fujin Kazeno!&#148;

&#147;WHAT?&#148;

&#147;Would you quit being a baby.&#148;

Fujin frowned skeptically.

&#147;They&#146;re professionals, trust me.&#148; Quistis sighed.

&#147;FINE.&#148;

&#147;Hyne, you are a pain sometimes.&#148; Quistis giggled, pinching her cheeks.

&#147;STOP THAT.&#148; Fujin grumbled, swatting at her hands.

&#147;Come on you grump.&#148; Quistis laughed, taking her hand in hers. &#147;And 
after that, we&#146;ll get a manicure, and our hair done, and then we&#146;ll go 
shopping, I hear they have wonderful boutiques here!&#148; She chattered 
merrily, all but skipping out the door. 

**********************

Fujin looked around the lobby sourly as a bevy of beautiful people 
walked about in bikinis and boxer shorts. While they waited for an 
attendant, Quistis moved idly to some cheery pop music playing through 
ceiling speakers.

&#147;SINFUL.&#148; Fujin finally stated.

&#147;What?&#148; Quistis laughed, looked at her.

&#147;NAKED.&#148;

&#147;They are not, quit being critical, there is a pool nearby after all.&#148;

&#147;OH...&#148;

&#147;See, now don&#146;t you feel silly.&#148;

&#147;Ladies, ladies, ladies.&#148; Announced a sleek and tanned gentleman, he was 
tall with flowing black hair and a build like a god. Dressed in a 
designer polo shirt and stylish shorts, he was well groomed and 
handsome.

 Fujin immediately disliked him and her expression showed it.

&#147;Well hi.&#148; Quistis chirped brightly.

&#147;Welcome to Delirium&#146;s Spas.&#148; The man smiled broadly, his teeth gleaming 
bright, and perfect. Fujin rolled her eye and folded her arms.

&#147;SHYSTER.&#148; She mumbled under her breath.

&#147;Stop it.&#148; Quistis said behind her smile, pinching Fujin&#146;s arm.

&#147;What can I, Ricardo, possibly do for two women of such beauty?&#148;

&#147;HA.&#148; Fujin snorted.

&#147;Fu...&#148; Quistis growled.

&#147;Charming.&#148; The man smiled candidly at Fujin.

&#147;Well Ricardo.&#148; Quistis started, looking down at her brochure. &#147;I&#146;d like 
a deluxe treatment, with mudpack and yogurt dips, the works.&#148; She 
purred.

&#147;MUD, YOGURT?&#148; Fujin mouthed, making a disgusted face.

Quistis rubbed her brow.

&#147;Excuse us a moment Ricardo.&#148; She smiled apologetically before pulling 
Fujin aside.

&#147;I.&#148; Fujin started, grinning wildly.

&#147;Don&#146;t start; I know what you&#146;re going to say.&#148;

&#147;IS YOGURT.&#148; Fujin giggled.

&#147;Yes...&#148;

&#147;LIKE FOOD?&#148;

&#147;Yes like food.&#148;

&#147;EXPLAIN.&#148;

&#147;You lay in it...&#148; Quistis grumbled; then gave Ricardo another 
apologetic smile.

Fujin erupted into giggles.

&#147;Great, now, you develop a sense a humor.&#148;

&#147;IS YOGURT. Fujin snickered. &#147;NO PLAY IN.&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t play in it. You lounge.&#148;

&#147;WHY!?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s good for the skin.&#148;

&#147;WHO SAYS?&#148;

&#147;Um... doctors.&#148;

&#147;NONSENSE.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s true.&#148;

&#147;IS ROTTEN MILK.&#148;

&#147;Fujin!&#148;

&#147;AND MUD?&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re being facetious.&#148;

&#147;MUD?&#148;

&#147;It goes on your face.&#148; Quistis said evenly, her expression dark.

Fujin snorted once then started laughing again.

&#147;You&#146;re mocking me aren&#146;t you?&#148; Quistis sighed.

&#147;UH HUH.&#148; Fujin nodded briskly, gaze dancing.

Quistis shook her head and chuckled, then threw an arm around her 
shoulder.

&#147;Ricardo!&#148; She whistled.

&#147;Yes?&#148; The man answered, walking towards them.

&#147;Make that two.&#148;

&#147;WHAT?&#148; Fujin all but shrieked.

&#147;Two deluxe specials then.&#148; Ricardo smiled, writing in a small notepad.

&#147;NEGATIVE.&#148; Fujin blurted.

&#147;Oh yes.&#148; Quistis laughed. &#147;And you&#146;re going to like it.&#148;

&#147;REFUSE.&#148;

&#147;If you want, but I&#146;m still paying for it.&#148;

&#147;BUT.&#148;

&#147;No buts, you can go back to the room if you want, but I came here to 
relax.&#148;

&#147;BUT QUISTIS.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;IS YOGURT!?&#148;

&#147;And mud.&#148; Ricardo added.

&#147;SHUT UP.&#148; Fujin snapped, pointing a finger at him. Quistis took Fujin&#146;s 
hand and moved it down.

&#147;Stop being rude.&#148;

&#147;APOLOGY.&#148;

&#147;Now then, we&#146;re going to go in here and I&#146;m going to teach you how to 
relax and enjoy yourself.&#148;

&#147;BUT.&#148;

&#147;Ah!&#148; Quistis frowned, putting a finger to her lips.

Cornered, Fujin relented quietly and the three of them walked into the 
back.

 &#147;Dressing rooms are this way. I will send your attendants in shortly.&#148; 
Ricardo motioned.

&#147;Thank you sir.&#148; Quistis smiled, sliding into an alcove to change, as 
did Fujin. A moment passed and Fujin peeked over her door to Quistis.

&#147;QUISTIS?&#148; She hissed.

&#147;Yes?&#148; Quistis sighed, looking over at her.

&#147;NO CLOTHES HERE.&#148;

&#147;Use the towel.&#148;

&#147;TOWEL?&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;KIDDING?&#148;

&#147;No, it&#146;s kind of hard to get a massage with your clothes on.&#148;

&#147;NO.&#148;

&#147;Fujin.&#148; Quistis sighed.

&#147;BUT.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll be in there with you silly, calm down.&#148;

Fujin growled low in her throat and disrobed.

&#147;FINE, FINE, FINE.&#148; She repeated in annoyance, praying Quistis 
appreciated all that she was doing for her.

Once wrapped in their towels the two met in the hall and looked at each 
other. Quistis couldn&#146;t help but laugh.

&#147;I don&#146;t think I&#146;ve seen anyone so miserable in a spa.&#148;

&#147;YOUR IDEA.&#148; Fujin sighed.

&#147;Trust me; once you get into it you&#146;ll enjoy it.&#148;

&#147;Ladies.&#148; A beautiful young woman smiled, she had olive skin and long 
black hair, and was dressed similar to Ricardo. Another attendant, a 
young man with short blonde hair and a boyish grin joined her side.

&#147;I&#146;m Lydia, and this is Reese.&#148; The girl said, nodding towards him. 
&#147;We&#146;ll be working with you today. Would you like to go separate or 
together?&#148;

&#147;Together.&#148; Quistis smiled. &#147;It&#146;s her first time, she&#146;s nervous.&#148;

&#147;Aw okay.&#148; Reese smiled. &#147;It&#146;ll take care of you.&#148; He said, putting a 
reassuring hand on Fujin&#146;s bare shoulder.

Her first impulse was to flip him through the nearest wall but a warning 
look from Quistis stopped her.

&#147;Okay, lets begin shall we?&#148; Lydia cheered merrily, then motioned for 
them to follow.

It took only a few moments for them arrive at their destination. Lydia 
nodded towards one of several tables. Quistis hopped up on the nearest 
one. Then laying facedown she allowed Lydia to gently undo the towel and 
maneuver it as to reveal Quistis&#146; back while keeping her rear discretely 
covered.

&#147;Okay your turn.&#148; Reese grinned hugely. Fujin felt like punching him in 
his perfect mouth. Awkwardly, and holding her towel in a deathlike grip 
she began to clamor atop the table. Reese, trying to be helpful moved to 
help. His kindness was rewarded with a sound much akin to a hiss as 
Fujin swatted at him irritably. Meanwhile, on Quistis&#146; table, Lydia was 
well at work and Quistis was making sounds that only added to Fujin&#146;s 
uneasiness.

&#147;Fujin.&#148; Quistis sighed, looking up at her.

&#147;WHAT?&#148;

&#147;Get on the table.&#148;

&#147;I AM.&#148;

&#147;Ugh...&#148;

&#147;BAH.&#148; Fujin grumbled, then laid face down on the table.

Reese, oblivious to how precarious his life hung in the balance moved to 
slip her towel down. Fujin made a noise, an inhuman noise, deep and 
guttural. It triggered an instinctual fear in Reese and he looked up at 
Lydia helplessly.

&#147;Perhaps we should switch.&#148; He offered.

&#147;Fujin, you&#146;re embarrassing me.&#148; Quistis said quietly from where her 
face was planted firmly in the circular pillow.

&#147;YOU EMBARRASSED!?&#148; Fujin huffed incredulously.

Lydia smirked and patted Quistis on the shoulder.

&#147;I&#146;ll switch, he&#146;s new, and he let her psyche him out.&#148;

&#147;Good luck.&#148; Quistis chuckled.

&#147;I&#146;m used to dealing with her type.&#148; Lydia smiled wickedly.

Thankful to be out of arms reach of the albino terror glaring at him, 
Reese rushed over to work on Quistis. Lydia walked over slowly and 
nodded to Fujin.

&#147;You&#146;re being an asshole.&#148; The girl said bluntly, then yanked Fujin&#146;s 
towel down about her waist.

&#147;DESIST!&#148; Fujin blurted, starting to rise.

&#147;I wouldn&#146;t get up if I were you.&#148; The girl warned.

Quistis meanwhile, was giggling in spite of herself at the sight. 
Relenting, Fujin rested her head on folded arms and glared hotly at her.

&#147;There, that wasn&#146;t so hard now was it? Since when did you get all 
demure anyway?&#148;

&#147;NONSENSE.&#148; Fujin grumbled as Lydia drove her palm hard into the hollow 
of her back. &#147;GAH!&#148; Fujin sputtered, then glared back at the girl.

&#147;DOING?&#148;

&#147;What you&#146;re paying me for. Now shut up.&#148; The girl answered bluntly.

&#147;WHAT!?&#148; Fujin gawked insulted and more than a little startled.

Quistis nearly choked at the look on her face.

************************** 

After thirty minutes of being groped and manhandled by an aggressive, 
beauty queen, Fujin found herself up to her shoulders in yogurt. All but 
fuming, she sat across from Quistis who was lounging contently in the 
mire with a pair of what looked like cucumber slices over her eyes.

&#147;You&#146;re upset aren&#146;t you?&#148; Quistis asked quietly.

Fujin didn&#146;t answer, choosing to let her piercing gaze do the talking.

&#147;Come now, you have to admit that felt good.&#148;

Still no answer was forthcoming.

&#147;I know it did, and you can quit giving me that look.&#148;

&#147;How are you ladies doing?&#148; Lydia asked, daintily, bringing them a 
couple of drinks, complete with little umbrellas.

 Fujin, keeping her vow of silence, snagged one of the drinks off the 
tray and flicked the umbrella at her. Removing her, cucumber glasses, as 
Fujin insisted on calling them, Quistis smiled thankfully at the girl 
then took her drink.

&#147;Let me know if you two need anything else.&#148;

&#147;We will, thanks Lydia.&#148; Quistis smiled, then looked at Fujin who sipped 
her drink quietly with both hands.

&#147;You&#146;re not fooling me.&#148; Quistis said evenly, eye flashing.

Fujin looked at her questioningly.

&#147;You know what I mean. This little front of yours, I&#146;m not buying it, I 
know you too well.&#148;

Fujin, finished her drink and licked her lips casually, then settled 
back with a sour expression.

&#147;Ignore me if you want, but I know you&#146;re loving this.&#148; Quistis chuckled 
then settled back. A long moment of silence passed between the two, then 
quite unexpectedly, Quistis caught a handful of slung yogurt right in 
the face.

 And so, the day went on, Fujin showed little signs of loosing up and 
Quistis began to think she was seriously irked. Finally, once freed of 
yogurts and mud masks, Fujin deemed it time to speak. The two of them 
sat side by side in barber chairs with an army of sharply dressed youths 
attending their hair and nails.

&#147;APOLOGY.&#148; Fujin said evenly.

&#147;For what?&#148; Quistis said quietly, looking at her from the corner of her 
eye.

&#147;TODAY.&#148;

&#147;Oh, now you want to apologize.&#148; Quistis sulked.

&#147;YES.&#148;

&#147;As mean as you&#146;ve been to everyone, it&#146;s not me you should be 
apologizing too.&#148; Quistis said sternly. &#147;You&#146;ve been an absolute terror, 
and that poor boy, Reese, I though he was going to pass out.&#148;

&#147;TOUCHED ME.&#148;

&#147;He&#146;s a masseuse, that&#146;s his job.&#148;

&#147;SORRY.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s okay; at least I hope you&#146;ve enjoyed yourself.&#148; Quistis sighed.

&#147;YES.&#148; Fujin grumbled quietly, like a scorned child.

&#147;That&#146;s all that matters, but you really didn&#146;t have to show out like 
that. It&#146;s okay to enjoy being pampered.&#148;

&#147;WILL MAKE UP.&#148; Fujin promised.

&#147;Oh, how so?&#148; Quistis smiled, intrigued.

&#147;WILL THINK OF.&#148;

&#147;That is so sweet!&#148; One of the men tending Fujin cooed in a faux 
feminine voice, he was tall, lanky and bore a head of hair so pink it 
was nearly blinding. Fujin looked at him as if a fish had flew from his 
mouth.

&#147;MIND BUSINESS.&#148; She barked.

&#147;Oh! Well I never.&#148; The man balked, fanning himself.

&#147;We&#146;re done here.&#148; Another man smiled, proud of his work. Fujin was a 
hard subject to work with where hair was concerned. Once more she wore 
her hair short and no nonsense, and it took an act of creative mastery 
to coax it into something easy yet attractive while still drawing little 
attention to her eye patch. To Fujin however, it looked just like it 
always did.

 Quistis&#146; however was a work of art, taking advantage of her longer 
hair, the hairdressers worked wonders, crafting it so that it flowed in 
soft waves to frame her features and bring out the already dazzling blue 
of her eyes.

&#147;NICE.&#148; Fujin admired, smilingly.

&#147;You like?&#148;

&#147;MUCH.&#148;

&#147;Good.&#148; Quistis beamed merrily, then gathered her purse. &#147;Shall we?&#148; She 
asked offering her hand.

&#147;SHALL.&#148; Fujin smirked, rising to her feet. After paying at the front 
desk and thanking the attendants the two walked out onto the promenade 
and looked around.

 Checking her watch, Quistis noted the time; then looked across the way.

&#147;There&#146;s a restaurant over there, care to check it out?&#148; She asked 
curiously.

Fujin squinted to get a better look. The restaurant, called the Velvet 
Rope, was a dimly lit place, with smoked glass and dim mood lighting. By 
the looks of it, the place was also part club. Appearing classier than 
the normal, bass thumping establishments, growing more common of late.

 After a scant second of deliberation Fujin nodded in agreement.

&#147;It looks like they&#146;re not open yet. That gives us time to do some 
shopping and get dressed up first.&#148; Quistis beamed cheerfully.

&#147;DRESSED UP?&#148; Fujin mouthed warily.

&#147;Yes, and I&#146;m helping you this time. It&#146;s about time I thought you 
style.&#148;

&#147;STYLE?&#148; Fujin huffed, looking at her neatly pressed, but unassuming 
white, dress shirt.

&#147;Yes, style.&#148;

&#147;CALLING ME SLOB!?&#148;

&#147;No, I didn&#146;t say that, you&#146;re not a slob but you have to admit you need 
help when it comes to dressing up.&#148;

&#147;CAN DRESS SELF.&#148;

&#147;Fu, listen, your tastes run a little militaristic, that&#146;s a bit much 
for going out to dinner don&#146;t you think.&#148;

&#147;NO.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s the point. Look, what did you think of the dress you wore to 
graduation.&#148;

&#147;COLD ASS.&#148;

&#147;Fujin.&#148;

&#147;WHAT?&#148; Fujin groaned with a slight whine in her voice.

&#147;There was nothing wrong with that dress and you know it. You looked 
stunning. That&#146;s the kind of thing you should wear when going out.&#148;

&#147;BUT.&#148;

&#147;Do it for me will you, think of it like playing dress up.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;M GROWN.&#148;

&#147;Fujin.&#148; Quistis sighed, folding her arms expectantly.

&#147;NOT SO SHORT.&#148; Fujin finally relented.

&#147;You have a deal.&#148; Quistis smiled, throwing an arm around her waist.

&#147;Trust me, once we&#146;re done, we&#146;ll be the talk of the town.&#148; Quistis 
smiled broadly, waving an outstretched arm as if gesturing to the 
horizon.

&#147;CAN&#146;T WAIT.&#148; Fujin grumbled good-naturedly, resting her head on Quistis 
shoulder.
