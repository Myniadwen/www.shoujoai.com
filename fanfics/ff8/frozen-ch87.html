&quot;SHOO.&quot; Fujin barked, placing a hand against Zell&#39;s chest as he bobbed 
about trying to peek in the door.

&quot;Aw hey, this ain&#39;t fair; you can&#39;t hog her all to yourself! She&#39;s my 
friend too damn it.&quot; Zell whined.

&quot;GET OVER IT.&quot; Fujin snorted. Pushing him back, she moved to shut the 
door only to have him stick his foot in it. Without skipping a beat, she 
pulled the door hard. With a shout of surprise and pain Zell removed his 
foot and hopped around cursing loudly. Fujin ignored his indignant 
remarks and threats of vengeance.

&quot;That was mean of you.&quot; Quistis said idly as she spooned daintily at a 
small bowl of frozen yogurt. Fujin folded her arms in a huff and leaned 
against the door.

&quot;TOUGH. ALL MINE.&quot; She said possessively.

&quot;Always.&quot; Quistis grinned, wrinkling her nose cutely.

Fujin smiled and walked slowly towards her with a shy but wonderfully 
warm look on her face. Quistis watched her contently and took her hand 
as she neared the side of the bed. Bringing it up to her face, she 
pressed her cheek against her palm and looked up softy.

&quot;I love you.&quot; She murmured, closing her eyes, savoring the warmth of her 
touch. Fujin blushed and sat gently down on the side of the bed. Letting 
the moment linger a moment longer, Quistis finally let go with a sigh 
and smiled thoughtfully.

&quot;I&#39;m proud too. Everyone says you were quite the trooper while I was 
away.&quot;

&quot;MAKE SOUND LIKE CHILD.&quot; Fujin scoffed.

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean it like that.&quot; Quistis laughed. &quot;I meant that everyone 
says you handled it pretty well, all things considering.&quot;

&quot;WAS LYING.&quot; Fujin admitted quickly.

&quot;Oh...&quot; Quistis frowned, looking worried.

Fujin sighed deeply and looked down.

&quot;WITHOUT YOU.... NOTHING.&quot; She said hauntingly, her fingers toying 
awkwardly with the bedspread.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry I left you alone for so long...&quot; Quistis sighed. Fujin looked 
up somewhat surprised.

&quot;NEVER ALONE.&quot; She said as if speaking a simple truth. &quot;ALWAYS HERE.&quot; 
She explained, putting a hand over her heart. This time it was Quistis&#39; 
turn to blush.

&quot;Well, you took care of me... and never gave up; I want you to know how 
much...&quot; She started to say but Fujin cut her off by pressing finger to 
her lips.

&quot;WHAT ELSE COULD I DO?&quot; She said as softly as she could manage.

Quistis nodded in understanding. &quot;Still...thank you.&quot;

Fujin smiled warmly and curling up beside her. Quistis sat her bowl of 
ice cream aside and Fujin rested her head in her lap.

&quot;You grew you&#39;re hair out.&quot; Quistis said chattily, running a hand 
through Fujin&#39;s sliver white locks.

&quot;NO TIME TO CUT.&quot; Fujin shrugged.

&quot;Planning to keep it like this?&quot;

&quot;UNKNOWN.&quot;

&quot;I think it makes you look cute.&quot;

&quot;WASN&#39;T BEFORE!?&quot; Fujin balked, looking up at her sternly.

&quot;You know what I mean.&quot; Quistis laughed, patting her playfully. &quot;Besides 
you&#39;re the one always saying, NOT CUTE.&quot;

&quot;NOT HAVE TO AGREE.&quot; Fujin pouted.

&quot;Oh please.&quot; Quistis laughed brightly.
&quot;BAH.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t bah me.&quot;

&quot;BAH.&quot;

&quot;What are you, a goat?&quot;

&quot;SO UGLY GOAT?&quot; Fujin gawked indignantly.

&quot;I didn&#39;t say that!&quot; Quistis groaned, rapping her lightly atop the head.

Fujin giggled then sighed contently. &quot;MISSED YOU.&quot; She murmured, 
cuddling closer.

&quot;I missed you too love.&quot; Quistis purred then looked out the open window. 
A gentle breeze flowed lazily through the room, carrying scents of 
spring. Frowning, she sighed in annoyance causing Fujin to regard her 
with concern.

&quot;PROBLEM?&quot;

&quot;I want to go outside, I&#39;m tired of being stuck indoors.&quot;

&quot;KADOWAKI SAID...&quot; Fujin started then paused. Without another word she 
slid out of the bed and regarded Quistis mischievously.

&quot;What are you?&quot; Quistis asked curiously.

Fujin didn&#39;t answer; instead, she deftly hoisted Quistis out of the bed 
and into her arms.

&quot;Ack Fujin!&quot; Quistis laughed in wonder. &quot;What are you doing!?&quot;

&quot;GOING OUT.&quot; Fujin smirked, removing the sensor nods from Quistis arms 
and brow.

&quot;Out!? But Kadowaki said I shouldn&#39;t go outside yet!&quot; Quistis started to 
protest.

&quot;WANTED TO GO.&quot; Fujin reminded her.

&quot;Well yes but...&quot;

&quot;THEN LETS.&quot;

Quistis giggled. &quot;But Kadowaki.&quot;

&quot;TRUST ME.&quot; Fujin grinned, nudging the door open.

&quot;But I&#39;m in my pajama&#39;s!&quot; Quistis giggled, but Fujin ignored her as she 
approached the door. Peeking out, she noted Kadowaki sitting in her 
office idly doing paperwork. After watching a moment and silencing 
Quistis&#39; giggles, she tiptoed past and out the door. The trip the hall 
was uneventful however, upon nearing the exit to the central hall they 
were forced to duck into a maintenance room. A trio of students walked 
by and paused to talk a moment just outside the door.

Fujin grumbled and looked around impatiently. The interior of the 
maintenance room was plastered with pinups and calendars depicting 
scantily clad women in lewd poses.

&quot;Looks like your room.&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;SHUSH.&quot; Fujin droned sourly.

After a few moments the students dispersed and Fujin continued her trek. 
I took a tenacious amount of patience and luck but finally they made it 
to Balamb&#39;s new enclosure, conveniently located at the site of the 
former training center. The area spanned more than a few acres and 
contained a wide range of flora and fauna, everything from a small but 
plush forest to a quaint series of well tended flower gardens. Luckily, 
Balamb was now traveling in a warmer clime, allowing for the massive 
dome covering the enclosure to be rolled back to reveal open sky and an 
amazing view of landscape far below.

&quot;Oh wow!&quot; Quistis breathed in wonder. &quot;When did they do all of this?&quot;

&quot;DURING REPAIRS.&quot; Fujin smiled, looking for nice secluded place to set 
her precious cargo.

&quot;Far better than the slaughterhouse we had before if you ask me.&quot;

&quot;MUCH.&quot; Fujin agreed, finally finding a shady clearing at the heart of 
an out of the way gathering of trees. Gently, she sat Quistis down then 
wiggled behind her, helping her sit up by letting her rest against her 
chest. Quistis took a deep breath and smiled happily as Fujin wrapped 
her arms around her comfortably. &quot;This is amazing.&quot; She purred 
contently. &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;PLEASURE.&quot; Fujin smiled.

&quot;I missed a lot haven&#146;t I?&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;NOT SO MUCH.&quot; Fujin answered, hugging her contently.

&quot;Did you guys ever figure out what Norg was up to down there?&quot;

Fujin grumbled, having no desire to think anymore about the encounter.

&quot;COPYING STUDENTS.&quot; Fujin explained, though sounding somewhat unsure. 
Quistis nodded in understanding.

&quot;Figures, from what I&#39;ve been told he tried to take over before. That 
explains those nasty humanoid things and those two students...he was 
going to try and replace us.&quot;

Fujin bristled at the thought. &quot;NOT DISCUSS IT.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; Quistis smiled, patting her hand comfortably. A long silence 
reigned as they sat watching the trees sway in the breeze as butterflies 
danced among them. The scene was entrancing and Quistis nestled back 
against Fujin&#39;s chest. Fujin sniffed slightly and tightened her embrace 
tightly. Looking up worriedly Quistis was startled to see tears flowing 
down Fujin&#39;s cheek.

&quot;Fu?&quot; She mouthed turning to face her. Fujin sniffled and hitched 
weakly, all composure leaving her as their gaze met.

&quot;thought lost you...&quot; She whimpered, barely audible between pitiful 
sobs.

&quot;Oh honey...&quot; Quistis cried in dismay at seeing her tortured so. &quot;I&#39;m 
here now, I&#39;m going anywhere...&quot;

&quot;so scared...alone...&quot; Fujin whispered, her voice sounding small and 
child like. With tears in her eyes, Quistis clung tightly to her lover 
in hopes of shielding her from the pain she had endured.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry; I never meant to leave you... I&#39;m here now; it&#39;s going to be 
okay...&quot;

Fujin fell apart, sobbing uncontrollably now as months of heartache and 
pain caught up with her at once. Quistis&#39; heart was torn asunder at 
seeing her in such turmoil and would&#39;ve have done anything to ease her 
suffering. Feeling helpless, she held her close and waited for the pain 
to subside while whispering soothing words. Finally, after a long while 
and having nearly cried herself into exhaustion, Fujin finally began to 
pick up the pieces. Looking down shamefully, she sniffed and wiped her 
eye with her palm.

&quot;PATHETIC...&quot; She choked, hating herself for falling apart so.

&quot;No.&quot; Quistis smiled gently, brushing away the strands of silvery hair 
that clung to her tear streaked face. &quot;It&#39;s only natural; you needed to 
let it out. I could tell you&#39;ve been holding it in. We all could use a 
good cry now and then.&quot;

&quot;SILLY.&quot; Fujin sighed then took a deep, shuttering breath. Quistis wiped 
her own eyes and hugged her close.

&quot;Then we&#39;ll be silly together.&quot;

&quot;OKAY.&quot; Fujin nodded blushing.

&quot;Good.&quot; Quistis winked.

&quot;UGH...&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

Fujin answered with a decidedly unattractive snort as she wiped her eye 
once more.

&quot;Oh that&#146;s cute.&quot; Quistis giggled.

Fujin made a face then stuck out her tongue.

&quot;Don&#39;t point that at me, I know where it&#39;s been.&quot; Quistis balked.

Fujin screamed then blushed profusely as Quistis exploded into laughter.

&quot;Better be quite you&#39;re going to give us away.&quot;

&quot;HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE!&quot;

&quot;Always.&quot;

&quot;TACKY.&quot;

&quot;You never complained before.&quot;

Fujin hid her face in her hands in a gesture that Quistis found 
immensely adorable.

&quot;I love it.&quot; She beamed, gently prying Fujin&#39;s hands away to peer 
laughingly at her. Fujin giggled and turned away embarrassed.

&quot;MEAN.&quot; Fujin sniffed, wiping away the last of her tears and smiling 
hugely.

&quot;Yeah well, you love me anyway.&quot; Quistis grinned, turning around to rest 
once more against Fujin&#39;s chest.

Fujin sighed and wrapped her arms around her. &quot;I DO.&quot; She admitted with 
a quaint smile. Rocking quietly Fujin savored the moment, burning it 
into her memory, the warmth of Quistis&#39; body, the scent of her hair, the 
soft touch of her hands on hers. Leaning down, she kissed the top of her 
head, squeezing her gently. Quistis looked up at her, eyes dancing 
brightly.

&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; She asked quietly.

&quot;MAKE COMPLETE.&quot; Fujin answered simply.

&quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot; Quistis sighed happily. &quot;You&#39;ve changed so much. I don&#39;t 
think I&#39;ve ever seen you this happy.&quot;

&quot;YOU&#39;RE HERE.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I am and I&#39;ve you to thank for that.&quot;

&quot;AND ELLONE.&quot;

&quot;Of course. The poor thing, we should take her out somewhere once I&#39;m 
back on my feet

Fujin nodded, liking the idea.

&quot;She&#39;s right you know.&quot; Quistis added quietly. &quot;Everyone&#39;s been taking 
her for granted.&quot;

&quot;YES.&quot;

&quot;A shame, I hope she&#39;ll be okay.&quot;

&quot;IN TIME.&quot;

&quot;I guess...&quot;

&quot;QUISTIS?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;VE QUESTION.&quot;

&quot;Ask silly.&quot;

&quot;EDEA?&quot;

&quot;What about her?&quot;

&quot;WHAT SAID?&quot; Fujin asked tentatively, noting the fact Quistis hadn&#39;t 
mentioned her even once.

&quot;Oh that...&quot;

&quot;SUPPOSE MEANING?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know...honestly.&quot;

&quot;CURIOUS&quot;

&quot;No, not really. Rinoa is the new sorceress; I don&#39;t think I have to 
worry about it.&quot;

&quot;NOT WHAT MEANT.&quot; Fujin frowned slightly, sensing that Quistis was 
dodging.

&quot;I know...&quot; She finally answered glumly. &quot;I&#39;ve lived this long without 
thinking about it and I&#39;ve no desire to start now.&quot;

&quot;OKAY.&quot; Fujin nodded in understanding, kissing her once more atop the 
head.

&quot;Kadowaki said Xu is to take over as headmaster.&quot; Quistis said chattily, 
wishing to change the subject.

&quot;AND?&quot;

&quot;Nothing, just talking.&quot;

&quot;UPSET?&quot;

&quot;Huh me? Why would I be?&quot;

&quot;NOT YOU.&quot;

&quot;Oh, no, not at all. I trust Cid&#39;s decision.&quot; Quistis laughed 
unconvincingly. &quot;Besides, I&#39;m of no use to anyone right now.&quot;

&quot;NONSENSE.&quot; Fujin huffed, but didn&#39;t want push the point.

&quot;Anymore word on Celest?&quot;

&quot;NO.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s really bugging you isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;NO.&quot;

&quot;Could&#39;ve fooled me.&quot;

&quot;NOT HARD.&quot;

&quot;Hey now.&quot; Quistis huffed.

&quot;YOU WERE RIGHT.&quot;

&quot;Oh, about?&quot;

&quot;THEIR CHOICE.&quot;

&quot;Un huh, I suppose, I just hope no one gets hurt, especially Celest, 
she&#39;s a good girl.&quot;

&quot;ENOUGH GOSSIP.&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s such fun.&quot; Quistis whined.

&quot;OLD HEN.&quot;

&quot;Who are you calling old?&quot;

&quot;OLDER THAN I.&quot;

&quot;Oh you are such a brat!&quot; Quistis squawked, smacking her hand playfully 
before settling down. &quot;This is nice.&quot; She finally announced as if having 
been debating it for several hours. Fujin nodded in agreement. The 
sounds of children laughing nearby caught their attention just as a 
large ball came bounding into the clearing.

&quot;Uh oh.&quot; Quistis mouthed, glancing back at Fujin with a grin. Fujin 
simply shrugged as the ball rolled towards her.

&quot;It went over here!&quot; A young boy called, stumbling into the clearing 
followed by another even younger boy and an older girl.

&quot;Excuse us.&quot; The girl said politely.

Fujin rolled the ball back towards them with a look of indifference, 
while Quistis beamed upon seeing them.

&quot;Well hi there.&quot; She said cheerfully. &quot;Who are you guys?&quot;

&quot;Um...&quot; The youngest boy mumbled, hiding behind the girl, most likely 
his sister.

&quot;Stop being rude.&quot; The girl scolded him before addressing Quistis.

&quot;I&#39;m Lindsey.&quot; She smiled then looked at the older boy. &quot;He&#39;s Christen.&quot;

&quot;No s&#39;posed to talk to strangers...&quot; The youngest boy mumbled from 
behind his sisters legs.

&quot;It&#39;s okay. My names Quistis, I&#39;m one of the teachers.&quot; Quistis grinned.

&quot;No look like teacher...&quot; The boy mumbled, peeking out curiously.

&quot;Sorry, he&#39;s such a baby.&quot; Lindsey groaned, picking him up. &quot;Say hello 
Cody.&quot; Still unconvinced, Cody simply waved slightly then buried his 
head against his sister&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Aww the poor thing&#39;s shy.&quot; Quistis cooed. &quot;Just you like you.&quot; She 
added quietly, cutting Fujin a sarcastic glance.

&quot;HUSH...&quot; Fujin glowered.

&quot;If you&#39;re a teacher, how come I never heard of you, and who&#39;s she?&quot; 
Christen asked, somewhat put off by Fujin&#39;s appearance.

&quot;She&#39;s the creepy ghost lady.&quot; Cody squeaked, still hiding his face.

&quot;Shush.&quot; Lindsey blushed, then promptly shoved Christen. &quot;And you, quit 
being a dork.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot;

Quistis looked questioningly at Fujin who was understandably baffled if 
not insulted.

&quot;Her name&#39;s Fujin, and she&#39;s not a ghost. As for me, I&#39;ve been sick, 
that&#146;s why you haven&#39;t heard of me.&quot; Quistis chuckled. &quot;I take it you 
came with this semesters cadets?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Ma&#39;am.&quot; The girl saluted, elbowing the older boy who was staring 
at Fujin intently.

&quot;Oh uh yeah.&quot; He stammered, then saluted.

&quot;RUNT...&quot; Fujin grumbled quietly, earning an elbow of her own from 
Quistis.

&quot;She&#39;s in her pajama&#39;s&quot; Cody giggled, noting Quistis&#39; pink satin 
sleepwear, complete with white mog patterns.

Fujin heaved, trying not to laugh. Quistis just smiled wide and ignored 
the comment.

&quot;Well it&#39;s a been a pleasure meeting you Lindsey, Christen.&quot; She said 
graciously. &quot;And you to Cody.&quot;

&quot;Nice meeting you too Ma&#39;am.&quot; Lindsey waved as Christen retrieved the 
ball. After the three youths left the clearing Fujin grinned wolfishly 
at Quistis.

&quot;Oh shut up.&quot; Quistis scowled playfully.

&quot;CUTE KIDS.&quot; Fujin said with obvious sarcasm.

&quot;Quiet you.&quot;

Fujin simply smiled and Quistis settled back against her in huff.

&quot;OBNOXIOUS BOY.&quot;

&quot;Which one?&quot;

&quot;BOTH.&quot;

&quot;Oh they&#39;re cute, be nice.&quot;

&quot;NOT NICE.&quot; Both of them said in unison. Fujin rolled her eyes, and 
Quistis smiled smugly.

&quot;BRAT.&quot; Both women said, again in unison. This time Quistis burst into 
laughter as Fujin tongued her cheek sourly. Unable and unwilling to keep 
up the charade of indignity she let herself laugh as well. And so it 
went, for the rest of afternoon and well into the early evening, the two 
of them sat, enjoying each other&#39;s company, laughing, joking, catching 
up on lost time until a distant thunderclap signaled an approaching 
storm.

&quot;Ah hell.&quot; Quistis groaned. &quot;And it was such a nice day.&quot;

&quot;STORM&#39;S SERENE.&quot; Fujin said sagely, untangling herself from behind her.

&quot;Yeah, when you&#39;re not caught in them.&quot; Quistis grumbled as Fujin gently 
lifted her off the ground.

&quot;READY TO GO?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I guess so.&quot; Quistis sighed dreamily, resting her head against 
Fujin&#39;s shoulder. &quot;This is awfully romantic you know.&quot;

&quot;EASY TO SAY.&quot; Fujin huffed under her breath

&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean, are you calling me fat?&quot;

&quot;NO DEAR.&quot; Fujin chuckled, setting off on long trek back to the clinic.

&quot;Well, you&#39;re the one who wanted to cart me out here.&quot;

&quot;JOKING.&quot; Fujin grinned.

&quot;Humpf.&quot;

&quot;SORRY.&quot;

&quot;Humpf.&quot;

&quot;TRULY.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re going to have to make it up to me.&quot; Quistis pouted pitifully, 
though both of them knew it was a fa&ccedil;ade.

&quot;I WILL.&quot;

&quot;Promise?&quot;

&quot;YES.&quot;

&quot;How...?&quot;

&quot;THINK OF SOMETHING.&quot; Fujin chuckled.

&quot;Better be good.&quot;

&quot;WILL BE.&quot;

&quot;Okay then, I forgive you.&quot; Quistis said with a faux haughtiness.

The journey back was thankfully uneventful Kadowaki had already left for 
the evening and there was no signs of her having noticed their absence, 
most likely in thanks to the, do not disturb, note Fujin conveniently 
left on the door as they left.

&quot;Mom will have a fit if she finds out we snuck out.&quot; Quistis giggled as 
they made their way inside.

&quot;SNEAKED.&quot; Fujin said, correcting her.

&quot;Oh hush.&quot;

&quot;AND YOU&#39;RE A TEACHER.&quot;

&quot;Bah, set me down.&quot;

&quot;AS YOU WISH.&quot; Fujin grinned with the knowledge that Quistis&#39; fragile 
condition was the only thing keeping her from tossing her 
unceremoniously onto the bed.

&quot;HUNGRY?&quot; Fujin asked going to the small refrigerator.

&quot;Yes please.&quot; She smiled thankfully then frowned in dismay. &quot;I want 
something bad for me like a steak, or big greasy burger, oh, oh!&quot; She 
added excitedly. &quot;With a giant order of fries.&quot; She sighed. &quot;And a big 
slice of apple pie...&quot;

&quot;GROSS.&quot; Fujin grumbled, then sat down with a spoon and a cup of yogurt.

&quot;Then a big helping of fried chicken!&quot;

&quot;MAKING ME SICK.&quot; Fujin replied, opening the container. &quot;OPEN.&quot; She 
said, sitting down and offering her a spoonful of the stuff.

&quot;What the heck is this?&quot; Quistis frowned.

&quot;SAME AS ALWAYS.&quot; Fujin sighed.

&quot;Ewww no Fu, please, no more yogurt, I&#39;m about to curdle...&quot; Quistis 
whined pitifully.

&quot;EITHER THAT OR I.V.&quot;

&quot;I want real food...&quot;

&quot;NOT STRONG ENOUGH.&quot;

&quot;Oh, blend it up then, anything.&quot;

&quot;DISGUSTING.&quot; Fujin winced.

&quot;Oh please, do it for me Fu.&quot; Quistis begged but Fujin was unflinching 
and promptly stuffed the spoon in her mouth to silence her. Much like a 
temperamental child, Quistis made a face but swallowed.

&quot;Ohh Hyne Fu&#39; it&#39;s not even fruit filled.&quot; She scowled in disgust.

&quot;YOU&#39;RE FRUIT FILLED, EAT.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a demon.&quot; Quistis announced in a tiff.

&quot;YES, DEMON, EAT.&quot; Fujin chuckled, then shoved another spoonful in her 
mouth.

After the troublesome meal, it was time to clean up and Quistis flat out 
refused to be sponge bathed like some decrepit invalid, so a compromise 
was made.

Sharing a large bath, the two sat snugly buried in warm suds and hot 
water with Quistis sitting with her back nestled comfortably against 
Fujin&#39;s chest.

&quot;Much better...&quot; She sighed as Fujin gingerly worked suds into her hair. 
&quot;You&#39;re too good to me.&quot;

&quot;YES.&quot; Fujin smiled, pouring a cup of water over her head to rinse.

&quot;Since when are you a comedian.&quot; Quistis sputtered.

Fujin didn&#39;t answer and merely soaked her again. Quistis&#39; hand rubbed 
lazily along Fujin&#39;s calf

&quot;Love you.&quot;

Fujin didn&#39;t reply but smiled warmly, rubbing a soapy sponge along 
Quistis&#39; pale shoulders. Quistis didn&#39;t let it bother her, understanding 
how much Fujin hated how awkward it sounded when she tried to profess 
her love. Leaning her head back slyly, she applied gentle kisses along 
Fujin&#39;s jaw. Shivering deliciously, Fujin arched a brow at her.

&quot;BEHAVE.&quot; She said with a dusky smile.

&quot;Okay.&quot; Quistis grinned; only mildly disappointed, there&#39;d be time for 
that sort of thing later, once she recovered. Leaning over the edge of 
the tub Fujin retrieved something then promptly dropped it into the 
water in front of Quistis.

&quot;DAMN.&quot; Fujin grumbled. &quot;GET PLEASE.&quot;

Quistis nodded and fumbled around in the water a moment, before bringing 
up a suds covered object.

&quot;What the?&quot; Quistis mouthed, blowing away the soap to reveal a simple 
but delicately made silver and gold ring, inlaid with two diamonds 
tucked neatly amid wispy engravings.

&quot;Omigod!&quot; Quistis gasped in shock causing her to fumble it back into the 
water. Fujin pouted slightly at that but grinned anew as Quistis babbled 
incoherently while trying to turn around to face her.

&quot;GOING TO HURT SELF.&quot;

&quot;I, what, I you, I can&#39;t believe, When, how!?&quot; Quistis stammered then 
hugged her awkwardly, dunking them both and causing water and suds to 
spill onto the floor.

Coming up for air Fujin giggled shyly as Quistis wiped suds from her 
eyes in disbelief.

&quot;You&#39;re not asking me to marry you are you!?&quot; She mouthed in wonder.

Fujin looked confused a moment as she tried to think of a way to explain 
it.

&quot;A SYMBOL.&quot; She finally said, holding up the newly retrieved ring.

&quot;A symbol?&quot;

&quot;YES.&quot; Fujin nodded, her hand trembling as she slid the ring onto 
Quistis&#39; finger. For her part, Quistis looked as if she were ready to 
faint.

&quot;REMINDER.&quot; Fujin breathed nervously. Quistis looked at her hand in 
wonder. After a nervous moment, Fujin&#39;s gaze met hers awkwardly.

&quot;WELL?&quot; She asked tentatively.

Quistis was struck speechless and only nodded wildly before collapsing 
against her in another waterlogged hug.

&quot;GOING TO DROWN US.&quot; Fujin announced simply, as they came up again. 
Quistis laughed and exhaled as if she&#39;d been holding her breath forever.

&quot;Oh my, oh wow.&quot; She gasped. &quot;Fujin, I can&#39;t, I can&#39;t believe this, I 
mean...&quot; She stammered, nearly going into hysterics again. &quot;I mean, what 
now, what, did you want, a wedding or something; I mean I don&#39;t need one 
but if you?&quot; She prattled on and Fujin put a finger to her lips and 
giggled.

&quot;DON&#39;T NEED OFFICIAL.&quot; She said, with obvious contempt for the idea of 
having some overblown fiasco just to symbolize something a couple 
already knew. Quistis nodded in understanding and was a bit relieved, 
being none to keen on the notion of blaring her private business to the 
world at large even though she could care less what others thought.

&quot;I couldn&#39;t agree more.&quot; She chuckled brightly then showered her with 
maddening kisses. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you did this.&quot; She muttered between 
kisses, causing Fujin to laugh brightly as she struggled for air. 
Finally, calming down a bit, and more than a little exhausted from the 
exertion, Quistis fell back against her once more.

After getting out of what little water remained in the tub and drying 
off, Fujin got dressed, and helped Quistis as well then gently carried 
her back to her bed. Quistis was aglow as she curled up cutely in the 
warm blankets, her eyes dancing with wonder and delight as Fujin locked 
up for the evening and turned out the lights. Making her way through the 
moonlit room she slipped quietly into bed next Quistis who curled 
against her with a small yawn.

&quot;love you...&quot; Fujin whispered, sweetly, kissing her gently on the lips, 
as they both slowly drifted into peaceful slumber.
