<p>Quistis walked in and  everyone gave a little sigh of relief. She sat herself down beside  Squall and Zell and set down her tray, dressed in her SeeD uniform.</p>
<p>“Just where were  you?” Irvine asked lewdly. “Because I do recall that you went off  with Arik.” She turned her blue eyes to him coldly and everyone  around her shivered a little at the cool gaze.</p>
<p>“Irvine, next time  you mess with private affairs, I’ll show you a side of Quistis I’m  sure you won’t like.” She said eerily calmly and turned back to  the rest of them smiling sweetly before dipping her tea bag in her  cup of hot water.</p>
<p>“Sorry ma’am,  it’ll never happen again.” He mumbled. Although everyone was  curious as to what he had done, no one said anything.</p>
<p>“But you still  haven’t answered the question, where were you?” Selphie tried  again. Zell shirked away from Quistis as she set down her cup.</p>
<p>“That’s none of  your business.” She replied but she couldn’t resist winking.  Selphie squealed a little with joy and sighed dreamily.</p>
<p>“I wonder what he’s  like…?”</p>
<p>“Morning everyone!”  Xu said, walking up the steps to greet them. Her timing had been so  good, Aya sputtered, milk coming out of her nose. Zell shirked the  opposite way, nearly flinging himself onto Quistis in an effort to  get away.</p>
<p>“That was gross,  Aya!” He said and then seemed to regain composure and his old self.  “But it was awesome! Do it again!” Aya hit him with one hand as  she clasped the other over her mouth and nose. Squall tossed some  napkins her way without flinching. Xu eyed Aya warily and Aya looked  up before renewing her sputtering.</p>
<p>“Ookk..”</p>
<p>“Come, sit down.”  Quistis said, scooting closer to Irvine to make room for Xu. The  brunette hesitated, unsure of whether or not it would seem suspicious  before realizing that her hesitance <em>was</em> suspicious and took  her place beside the Instructor.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t  happen to know who Quistis was with, right, Xu?” Selphie asked. Xu  blanched.</p>
<p>“Uh…I…um…uh…er…”  She stammered.</p>
<p>“She’s sworn to  secrecy.” Quistis explained. Selphie pouted.</p>
<p>“Come oonn…” She  whined. “That’s just not fair. Xu leaned closer to Quistis and  muttered,</p>
<p>“You’ve doomed me  Quisty. They’re going to be hounding me for the rest of the week.”  Quistis leaned back, giggling.</p>
<p>“We could always  tell them.” Irvine cocked his eyebrow at the two whispering.</p>
<p>“Hey now, friends  don’t keep secrets from friends.” He said, nudging Quistis  playfully.</p>
<p>“Might I remind you  what you did?” Quistis responded coldly.</p>
<p>“No ma’am.” He  said, hanging his head again and moving his eggs around the plate.  Quistis finished her English muffin and stood up.</p>
<p>“I’m going to  begin setting up for class. I’ll see you people later.” She said  and turned to Xu. “I’m going to need your help.”</p>
<p>“But I’m not  done…”</p>
<p>“Ok, I’ll take  Irvine instead.” Xu stood up quickly.</p>
<p>“Coming.” She said  and followed the blond out. Irvine watched them go with lust in his  eyes.</p>
<p>“Damn…two girls in  a classroom? Interesting…” He was interrupted by a sudden gagging  noise followed by some coughs. Aya had apparently spit milk out of  her nose again. “What is wrong with you woman!”</p>
<p>“That was awesome,  Aya! You didn’t tell me you could do that! Man, that one must’ve  gone what, three feet?” Zell said, patting her on the back. Squall  threw napkins at her some more. Rinoa kept staring at the two girls  as they turned the corner, perplexed.</p>
<p>“It’s Saturday…”  She whispered.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>As soon as Quistis  entered the classroom, she took Xu’s hand and gently forced her  onto the desk, their faces close.</p>
<p>“Hmm, you think they  noticed anything?” Xu asked as Quistis went straight for her neck.</p>
<p>“Probably.”  Quistis whispered against her skin. Xu trembled a little.</p>
<p>“Daaaammnn…” A  voice behind them whispered low and huskily. The two of them yelped  and stood at attention. Seifer stared at them with saucer pan wide  eyes. “To think…all these years of me coming in late and this is  the reward I get for coming in early?”</p>
<p>“SEIFER!” Xu  shrieked while Quistis pushed her glasses back up, blushing bright  red. She folded her arms across her chest and looked at the ground.</p>
<p>“Hey now, don’t  stop on account of me, you hear?” He said with awe.</p>
<p>“I’m going to  murder you!” Xu leapt at him but Quistis gently caught her arm and  tugged her back.</p>
<p>“Seifer, we really  don’t appreciate you spying on us like that.” Quistis replied.</p>
<p>“Spying? You’re  the ones who came in and started putting on a show for me!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, the  show’s been canceled, buddy. Leave through those doors.” Xu said  angrily, pointing to the exit. Seifer pouted like a little puppy.</p>
<p>“I can’t stay and  join you?” Xu glared dangerously and Seifer sighed, stood up and  walked out the door.</p>
<p>“Lucky that was just  Seifer.” Quistis commented, brushing a stray lock of hair behind  her ear. The two of them looked at each other and burst into giggles.</p>
<p>“That was too  close.” Xu replied. “We’d better not…” Quistis apparently  wasn’t listening as she turned to face her and draped her arms  around her shoulders.</p>
<p>“<em>Will Quistis  Trepe please report to the bridge at once. Quistis Trepe, to the  bridge.</em>” Quistis gave an exasperated sigh sagging against Xu.</p>
<p>“Everyone’s out to  stop us.” She mumbled and Xu laughed, gently pushing her away.</p>
<p>“We’ll have time  later.” She kissed the blond on the cheek and Quistis pouted.</p>
<p>“You’d better keep  that promise.” She said and strode out of the door. After she left,  Xu loosened her collar and exhaled deeply. Quistis could do things to  her no one else could…and it sometimes made her uncomfortable.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“What’s the  situation?” Quistis said as she walked to the bridge.</p>
<p>“We’re receiving a  distress signal from Winhill. Someone or something is attacking the  townspeople.” Nida replied.</p>
<p>“We sent troops  there, didn’t we? To establish the peace there?” Quistis asked.</p>
<p>“No word from them.  They paged in just a few minutes ago…here’s the replay.”  Quistis and the others listened as Nida replayed the audio tape.</p>
<p>“<em>FFzzzz…fzzz…</em>Balamb  Garden! Balamb! We need reinforcements! We nee…<em>ffzz</em> Winhill  is being attacked…<em>ffzz</em>…townsperson…” What followed was  an explosion and bone chilling screams. The audio tape ended with a  faint click. The group looked on in silence.</p>
<p>“Those were…high  ranking SeeD…weren’t they?” Selphie asked meekly. Squall sighed  and ran a hand through his hair. “Squall?”</p>
<p>“What about the  other three? Have you been able to contact any of them?” He asked  Nida. Nida shook his head.</p>
<p>“No response from  any of them.”</p>
<p>“Then we’ll have  to presume that they’re dead or unconscious.” Squall replied.  “We’ll split up into three groups. Quistis, you take Irvine and  Selphie and you three will cover the outskirts, I will take Rinoa and  Zell and we’ll head straight for the town center. Nida, plot course  for Winhill immediately. Everyone assemble all equipment and prepare.  Meet back here when called.” Everyone saluted and marched into the  elevator.</p>
<p>Xu waited for the  elevator to return to the first floor. When it did, Quistis and the  other stepped out.</p>
<p>“Oh!” She  exclaimed in surprise. Everyone filed out except Quistis, who hung  behind. “What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“Four SeeD that we  dispatched three months ago to Winhill just paged in saying Winhill  was in distress.” Quistis replied. Xu started to worry. “All four  are presumed dead. Squall is sending us out to see what the situation  is and hopefully find out if the four are alive.” Xu touched  Quistis’s arm gently as they walked down the hall to Quistis’s  room.</p>
<p>“Should I go  too?”<br />
  “No.” Quistis replied, entering her room with Xu  following.</p>
<p>“Well, is there  anyway I can help?” Quistis turned around and smiled.</p>
<p>“You can be safe.”  She whispered and kissed her on the cheek. “I couldn’t possibly  ask you to risk yourself. Besides, it shouldn’t be anything more  than we can handle.” Xu pouted, wondering exactly what she could do  to help. She walked over to the bed and hopped on, curling herself  into a ball. Quistis stepped out, still zippering up her peach  colored top. “Xu, sweetie, what’s wrong?” She walked over and  sat down beside her, gently stroking her head.</p>
<p><em>“You’d  laugh.” </em>Xu thought. <em>“I just want to protect you so that  nothing happens. How many sleepless nights did I have when you and  the others were off on missions? How many times did I nearly have  nervous breakdowns wondering if you were going to come back safe from  fighting Edea, or Adel or anyone?</em>”</p>
<p>“Xu, I promise, I’m  going to come back safe, ok? And when I do, we’ll find a day that  we can spend alone, just us. I’ll take a day off if I need to, ok?  We’ll take a trip to Esthar or something and go shopping there. Or  we’ll go to Deling and head out to a few nightclubs.” Xu sat up  and sighed.</p>
<p>“I’m acting like  such a worrywart. Just come back safe, mmk? Nothing else matters.”  Quistis kissed her on the cheek and whispered in her ear,</p>
<p>“I promise.”</p>
<p>-</p>

<p>Selphie stood in the  hallways, swinging her Strange Vision to and fro as a warm up. Irvine  walked up quietly behind her.</p>
<p>“Boo!” Selphie  shrieked and turned around, flailing her Strange Vision that normally  would’ve taken off anyone’s head but Irvine expertly ducked and  laughed.</p>
<p>“IRVINE!” Selphie  yelled.</p>
<p>“Don’t be so  uptight before a mission, you’ll wear yourself out.” He chuckled.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re one to  talk you big meany.” She stuck out her tongue. Irvine scratched his  head as Selphie turned back around to continue with her warm up.</p>
<p>“Say…Sephy…”  He began.</p>
<p>“What?” She barked  angrily, not turning to face him.</p>
<p>“How about you and I  go out for dinner after this mission?” Selphie stopped and turned  around, her eye quizzical.</p>
<p>“What? Are you  asking me out?” She asked in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Sure sounded that  way.” Selphie shrieked again and almost tackled Irvine with a hug.</p>
<p>“Of course!” She  replied with glee.</p>
<p><em>We are approaching  Winhill. Will Rinoa, Irvine, Zell, Quistis, and Selphie please report  to the bridge, I repeat, we are approaching Winhill.</em></p>
<p>Selphie looked up at  the speakers.</p>
<p>“Looks like we’re  here.” She said seriously. Irvine nodded and the two of them walked  quietly to the elevator.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Quistis was in no  hurry to leave. She gently held Xu’s hand, trying to stay with her  for as long as possible.</p>
<p>“You’d better go.”  Xu said, pulling her hand away. Quistis nodded, stood up and walked  out the door. Xu sighed and shook her head. Why was it that it was  easier to handle an entire Garden in chaos and be completely unnerved  by her girlfriend leaving for one mission?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Squall stood stoically  as they approached the small town of Winhill, his birthplace.</p>
<p>“Remember the plan.  Team A will secure the outskirts, make sure no one suspicious enters  or leaves. When the outskirts are secure, meet Team B, who will head  straight for the center of town where the SeeD were last traced to.  If there’s any opposition, take them down quickly. Once we locate a  suspicious character, contact the other team and they’ll rush there  immediately.” Squall ordered. Suddenly, the Balamb Garden lurched  to a stop and the Squall looked at the team, nodded his head and the  group filed out of the Garden.</p>
