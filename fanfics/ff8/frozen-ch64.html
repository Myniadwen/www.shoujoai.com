&quot;Can&#39;t you guys do this by yourself, I don&#39;t feel good.&quot; Selphie 
groaned, while everything seemed still enough, she could fell the 
storm&#146;s effects on Balamb Garden. Every rise, every dip, every sway, 
bringing her closer to what she was certain would a messy demise.

&quot;Hey you&#146;re in charge of this mess, so you have to be here too.&quot; Celest 
snapped.

&quot;Come now Selphie.&quot; Zell laughed while hanging a fleet of large 
balloons. &quot;The graduation dance is just a couple days away, we need you. 
Take one for the team.&quot;

&quot;Oh shut up...&quot; Selphie said mockingly then climbed atop a table to lay 
down. &quot;I&#146;ll be over here if you need me.&quot;

&quot;Ten to one she hurls.&quot; Irvine noted.

&quot;Some husband your going to be.&quot; Rinoa scowled. A low and mournful growl 
caused her to turn around. Ifrit, the guardian force of fire, stood in 
the center of the dance floor looking lost and bored. The great beast 
seemed out of place and Rinoa couldn&#146;t help but grin at him.

&quot;Rinoa, is it safe to have him standing around like that.&quot; Nicole said 
skeptically, she still had a distrust of the primal creatures and the 
situation with Griever didn&#146;t help matters.

&quot;We need the light.&quot; Rinoa shrugged, glancing at the creature again. A 
fiery glow surrounded the creature, bathing the hall in warm light.

&quot;Squall will have a fit if he finds out you&#146;re using him like that.&quot; 
Selphie gurgled.

&quot;It&#146;s okay, besides, I&#146;m sure the big guy is glad to help.&quot; Rinoa 
smiled, waving at the glaring guardian.

&quot;Oh yeah, he looks thrilled.&quot; Zell snorted as he slipped cautiously 
around it with a box of tablecloths.

A group of young graduates rushed up to Selphie. The group chattered 
excitedly, asking her about, lighting, food and preparations. Each had a 
list and all spoke at once. Pulling herself up, the small woman glanced 
at each list, offered suggestions then shooed them away.

&quot;She&#146;s miserable.&quot; Nicole said quietly to Irvine.

&quot;Yeah, I know, I&#146;ve tried cheering her up. She&#146;ll be okay once we get 
out of the storm.&quot;

&quot;RINOA!&quot; Celest screeched, causing everyone to jump.

&quot;What?&quot; Rinoa frowned, glancing at her.

&quot;WE&#146;RE LATE!&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Rinoa glanced at her watch and noticed the time. &quot;Oh 
Gods...Cid...!!&quot;

&quot;Great, late for you&#146;re Diploma&#146;s. That&#146;s a good way to start out as 
SEED&#146;s.&quot; Zell chuckled.

&quot;We&#146;ll be back in about an hour!&quot; Rinoa shouted as she and Celest 
scrambled into the darkness.

**************************

&quot;Quistis?&quot; Xu asked quietly.

&quot;I don&#146;t know...&quot; Quistis hissed under her breath.

&quot;You&#146;re student is late Miss Trepe.&quot; Another teacher whispered to her.

&quot;So is yours!&quot; Quistis scowled.

Fujin and the other SEED graduates stood in line as Cid and Squall 
talked off to the side. Squall looked anxious and embarrassed about 
Rinoa&#146;s tardiness, Cid though seemed only mildly concerned. With the 
power still off he was understanding, besides the girls were only a few 
minutes late.

The sound of hurried footsteps signaled the absent graduates approach. 
Celest was fumbling with her uniform and Rinoa was brushing her hair in 
mid run. Squall turned and folded his arms disapprovingly as they 
scurried in line. Quistis shook her head and sighed.

&quot;Always a fiasco.&quot; She groaned.

&quot;If I recall, you had a problem with you&#146;re skirt during our 
Graduation.&quot; Xu whispered.

&quot;Shut up.&quot; Quistis snipped.

&quot;I remember that.&quot; Another teacher smirked wolfishly. &quot;Quite a show.&quot;

&quot;You too.&quot; Quistis growled at him.

Cid cleared his voice as he picked up the diplomas and badges.

&quot;So glad you ladies could join us.&quot; He chuckled.

Rinoa blushed profusely and Celest just grinned stupidly.

Cid made his way to the line of new SEED&#146;s. Without proper lighting the 
affaire seemed some what impromptu but nonetheless serious.

Squall followed close behind him, studying the students stoically. Cid 
approached to first graduate. Shaking the youth&#146;s hand he spoke quiet 
words of encouragement then moved onward.

&quot;Fujin did good. I&#146;m glad she made it.&quot; Xu whispered to Quistis.

&quot;I knew she would, she should&#146;ve have made it earlier.&quot; Quistis smiled, 
cleaning her glasses.

&quot;Yeah, but that couldn&#146;t be helped.&quot; Xu smirked, then motioned to Cid 
who&#146;d made his way to Celest. The poor man seemed unwilling to pin the 
badge on her uniform.

&quot;I know.&quot; Quistis grinned, watching the awkward exchange as Celest 
spared him the embarrassment and attached the badge herself.

&quot;Is she going to the dance?&quot; Xu asked curiously.

&quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;Fujin.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t think so, you know how she is with crowds.&quot;

&quot;Have you asked her if she was?&quot;

&quot;Yes, she was adamant.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s a shame.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but I&#146;m not going to force her to do something she doesn&#146;t want 
to do. I learned that lesson already.&quot;

&quot;So what&#146;s up with Kevin?&quot;

&quot;What about him?&quot;

&quot;Did you talk to him?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;What did you do?&quot;

&quot;Told him.&quot;

&quot;Told him?&quot; Xu frowned uncomprehendingly. Quistis gave her a look and 
Xu&#146;s eyes widened.

&quot;Oh...told him.&quot; She nodded knowingly.

&quot;Did he freak.&quot;

&quot;Not as much as I thought he would.&quot;

&quot;Have you decided anything?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean.&quot; Quistis blinked, glancing at her.

&quot;The others...&quot;

&quot;Eventually, I&#146;m just waiting for the right time.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m surprised you&#146;ve not been busted yet.&quot; Xu whispered lower. &quot;You two 
haven&#146;t tried very hard to keep it a secret.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; Quistis sighed, smiling fondly as Cid made his way to Fujin.

&quot;So what&#146;s he going to do now?&quot;

&quot;He decided to sit out the storm. I think Celest was going to ask him 
out too.&quot;

&quot;Celest!?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Poor Kevin.&quot;

&quot;Yeah really.&quot; Quistis laughed then focused on Cid and Fujin.

Cid looked Fujin over proudly and shook her hand. Her face was 
unreadable and it was unclear if she was nervous, proud, or anything. 
But with her, Cid had come to accept her idiosyncrasies and was not put 
off by her expressionless demeanor.

&quot;You&#146;ve come a long way.&quot; Cid whispered as he pinned the badge to her 
uniform. &quot;Quistis speaks highly of you. She&#146;s proud of you, we all are. 
I hope you continue to impress us.&quot; He smiled, placing the diploma in 
her hand. &quot;Congratulations.&quot; He finally finished, then moved on. Moving 
towards Quistis, he paused and glanced at the last badge and diploma.

&quot;Miss Trepe.&quot; He said respectfully.

&quot;Sir.&quot; Quistis nodded somberly.

&quot;These are for you. In memory of her.&quot; He said quietly, placing Aeka&#146;s 
diploma and badge in the instructor&#146;s trembling hands.

&quot;Thank you sir.&quot; She whispered, gently.

With that, Cid turned to face the graduates with a broad smile and 
brought the brief ceremony to a close with a short speech welcoming them 
to SEED.

After all was said and done, Quistis found Fujin and Rinoa waiting for 
her in the hall outside Cid&#146;s office.

&quot;Hiya Quisty.&quot; Rinoa beamed.

&quot;Rinoa.&quot; Quistis smiled somberly.

&quot;You okay?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I guess.&quot; Quistis frowned, holding up Aeka&#146;s diploma.

&quot;Oh, what are going to do with it?&quot; Rinoa asked timidly.

&quot;I&#146;m not sure, yet. I&#146;ll either keep it or put it in the classroom.

&quot;That&#146;s good.&quot;

&quot;We&#146;re working to get things ready for the dance, you want to help out.&quot;

&quot;Sure, I&#146;ll be down there once I get changed.&quot;

&quot;Okay see you there.&quot; Rinoa smirked then hurried off.

Fujin waited a moment then looked at Quistis thoughtfully.

&quot;What&#146;s on your mind?&quot; Quistis asked as they started up the hall.

&quot;NOTHING.&quot;

&quot;You going to come too?&quot;

&quot;WHERE?&quot;

&quot;To help get preparations set up for the dance.&quot;

&quot;WAS GOING TO GYM.&quot; Fujin apologized.

&quot;That&#146;s okay, go on, I&#146;ll just meet up with you later.&quot;

&quot;SURE?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I&#146;ll just see you later.&quot; Quistis winked.

Fujin nodded and waved goodbye. Quistis watched her go a minute and 
smiled inwardly before heading back home.

*************************************

Quistis arrived in the dance hall to the sound of hammering and scores 
of people chattering as they worked. The first thing she noticed was 
Ifrit standing in the middle of the dance floor. The guardian force 
looked absolutely furious.

&quot;Oh no.&quot; Quistis groaned, rushing up to him. With a gesture she 
dismissed the guardian, who was more than happy to leave.

&quot;What happened to the light!?&quot; Rinoa frowned, looking up.

&quot;You did this?&quot; Quistis scowled.

&quot;What? Ifrit?&quot; Rinoa blinked, startled by the angry glare in Quistis&#146; 
eyes.

&quot;Yes Ifrit!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, we needed the light.&quot;

&quot;Ever hear of flashlights.&quot; Quistis snapped.

&quot;Its easier this way. Why did you dismiss him?&quot; Rinoa scowled.

Zell and Selphie exchanged worried looks then slipped into the shadows.

&quot;You two come out here too.&quot; Quistis barked.

&quot;Busted...&quot; Irvine whispered, ducking behind a group of workers.

&quot;You three come with me.&quot; Quistis ordered.

&quot;Told you we should have said something.&quot; Zell mumbled to Selphie.

&quot;Its not my fault.&quot; Selphie offered.

&quot;What did I do.&quot; Rinoa snapped irritably after they were away from 
prying ears.

&quot;That&#146;s the height of irresponsibility. I thought I trained you better 
than that Rinoa!&quot; Quistis said in disappointment. &quot;This is not what I 
expected from you your first day as a SEED.&quot;

&quot;What&#146;s the big deal, he was just standing there.&quot;

&quot;Guardian Forces are not tools of convenience!&quot; Quistis glared.

&quot;Miss Trepe...&quot; Zell started but was cut off.

&quot;And you, Zell you know better than that. Selphie, you too!&quot;

&quot;It was just for a little while.&quot; Selphie squeaked.

&quot;That doesn&#146;t matter. Guardians are living things, not like us, but 
alive nonetheless. They&#146;re to be treated with respect, not as some tool 
or a glorified handy light.&quot;

&quot;We weren&#146;t hurting anything.&quot; Rinoa said defensively.

&quot;How would you feel to be used like that. Forced to stand there like an 
idiot torch bearer.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;Well...I...&quot; Rinoa blinked.

&quot;Un huh, exactly.&quot;

&quot;We use them to fight, how&#146;s this any different.&quot; Rinoa shot back.

Zell shrank back a bit, as did Selphie.

&quot;Rinoa...&quot; Quistis sighed in disappointment. &quot;I&#146;m not doing this right 
now. Look, just don&#146;t call them for frivolous nonsense.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot; Rinoa pouted.

&quot;And you two...&quot; Quistis frowned, pointing at Zell and Selphie. &quot;You 
knew it was wrong, next time do something about it.&quot;

&quot;Yes Ma&#146;am.&quot; Zell mumbled.

&quot;Sorry Quisty.&quot; Selphie said, feeling ashamed and small.

&quot;Nowthen...&quot; Quistis sighed and removed her glasses to clean them. 
&quot;Let&#146;s just go back in there and get back to work. I&#146;ll run to my 
apartment to get some lights. I think I still have those lanterns from 
when we went camping. Zell run down to supplies and get some batteries. 
It won&#146;t be much but it will do.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; Zell nodded then jogged off.

&quot;I&#146;ll be back in a bit.&quot; Quistis smiled gently, leaving Rinoa and 
Selphie standing alone.

&quot;Man she blew up.&quot; Irvine said in awe, walking up to them. Selphie spun 
around and pushed him slightly in anger.

&quot;You big clod!&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot; Irvine yelped as Rinoa walked away feeling dejected.

&quot;You left me to get yelled at, where were you?&quot; Selphie barked at 
Irvine, who was still trying to stay out of arms reach.

&quot;Are you nuts, she was furious, no reason for me to get in the middle of 
it.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m you&#146;re wife you ass! You&#146;re supposed to stand by my side!&quot;

&quot;Not yet you aren&#146;t&quot; Irvine chuckled, as he dodged away.

&quot;Oh! You jerk!&quot; Selphie huffed indignantly swiping at him playfully

***************************

&quot;How long?&quot; Xu asked somberly.

&quot;Two more days at least.&quot; Squall sighed, rubbing his brow.&quot;

&quot;How are the kids holding up?&quot; Cid asked.

Xu shrugged slightly. &quot;They&#146;re okay, but the youngest ones aren&#146;t going 
to be happy when the lights go out in their section.&quot;

&quot;It can&#146;t be helped.&quot; Squall said firmly. &quot;Even with all the other areas 
in blackout and minimal heating we&#146;re still going to go completely dead 
within the twenty four hours.&quot;

&quot;At least the storm passed, we can open the skylights now.&quot; Cid offered.

&quot;True, that will help. But if things keep up I&#146;d like permission to take 
the younger students to one of the other Gardens until repairs are 
made.&quot; Xu asked.

&quot;Of course.&quot; Cid nodded.

&quot;We may consider evacuating altogether if we&#146;re not up and running 
within the week.&quot; Squall said darkly.

&quot;Squall&#146;s right. Everyone is going to get tired of sitting in the dark 
with nothing to do.&quot; Cid sighed.

&quot;This place is creepy with no lights, I can&#146;t blame them. I&#146;m surprised 
we&#146;re doing as well as we are.&quot; Xu said.

&quot;Don&#146;t sell yourselves short.&quot; Cid smiled and stood. &quot;Surely, we&#146;ll be 
up and running before anything like that happens.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps.&quot; Squall shrugged. &quot;Still better safe than sorry.&quot;

&quot;True, too true, okay then, if things are not up and running by the time 
of the dance, we&#146;ll evacuate.&quot; Cid offered.

&quot;Sounds good to me.&quot; Xu shrugged.

&quot;I agree.&quot; Squall nodded and stood.

&quot;Okay then, I&#146;ll contact the other Gardens, see what they have to say.&quot; 
Cid explained as everyone prepared to leave.

After leaving Cid&#146;s office Xu pulled Squall aside.

&quot;We really do need to do something soon Squall. This place is like a 
tomb with no power.&quot;

&quot;I know, and that&#146;s not half of the trouble.&quot; Squall said in a quiet 
whisper.

&quot;What?&quot; Xu frowned.

&quot;The training center, it&#146;s pulling a lot of our emergency power. We&#146;ve 
already had few creatures escape.&quot;

&quot;I thought the center had its own emergency generator. It should last 
weeks?&quot;

&quot;It does, but it went down almost immediately. Something damaged the 
backup system.&quot;
&quot;What, when?&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t know, it could have been anything. One of the monsters, an 
errant spell, who knows? The damage is old though that much we do know&quot;

&quot;Does Cid know? We may need to evacuate early.&quot; She proclaimed 
worriedly.

&quot;He knows, we&#146;ve already taking everything into account. He just doesn&#146;t 
want to get everyone worked up.&quot;

&quot;See, I always said that Center was a bad idea. Keeping monsters in here 
is just plain foolish.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t blame Cid, he said it was Norg&#146;s idea. There was just no time to 
pull the system out.&quot;

&quot;Well, so what now?&quot;

&quot;If we need to we can exterminate them.&quot; Squall shrugged.

&quot;Squall! That&#146;s just heartless.&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot;

&quot;Its bad enough we keep them around to beat up on. Now you want to just 
go in there and slaughter them. It&#146;s a horrible thing to do.&quot;

&quot;Whatever... Xu they&#146;re aberrations.&quot;

&quot;They can&#146;t help that, just open the outer cargo doors and let them 
escape into the wild.&quot;

&quot;Where, into the middle of the ocean?&quot; Squall scoffed. &quot;Now who&#146;s 
horrible.&quot;

&quot;Oh well...damn.&quot; Xu frowned.

&quot;Look, if we can keep from taking drastic measures I&#146;ll talk to Cid as 
soon as the powers up and running.&quot;

&quot;Why would you do that?&quot;

&quot;Because you made a good point. It&#146;s dangerous to keep them here, and 
its wrong to just breed them for combat training. We&#146;ll free them on one 
of the islands.&quot;

&quot;You just said their aberrations.&quot;

&quot;Oh they are, that&#146;s why I said an island.&quot; Squall smirked dryly, 
folding his arms.

&quot;Think Cid will go along with that?&quot; Xu wondered.

&quot;I think so, he&#146;s tired of keeping them around, especially with 
accidents on the rise. It&#146;s a wonder nobodies been killed yet.&quot;

&quot;Sounds like you&#146;ve already been thinking about it?&quot;

&quot;Off and on, it&#146;s been on my to do list.&quot;

&quot;We&#146;ve all been so busy lately it&#146;s a wonder that we get anything done.&quot;

&quot;I know and now the dance coming up.&quot; He groaned.

&quot;Don&#146;t forget about the wedding.&quot; Xu cooed.

&quot;Wonderful.&quot; He groaned again.

&quot;Oh Hyne!&quot; Xu blurted, backing up as if startled. Squall spun around 
expecting something to be sneaking up on him. Seeing nothing he turned 
back to see Xu gawking at him.

&quot;What!?&quot; Squall frowned, perplexed.

&quot;Squall Leonhart, I think that this is the longest I&#146;ve ever heard you 
talk to anyone!&quot; She grinned. Squall growled and relaxed slightly.

&quot;I feel.... honored.&quot; She continued. &quot;Rinoa is going to be soooo 
jealous.&quot;

&quot;Hyne...&quot; Squall grumbled, rolling his eyes. &quot;Goodbye.&quot; He said 
woodenly, then walking away.

&quot;Wait!&quot; She giggled, chasing after him. &quot;Were you flirting with me?&quot;

&quot;Go away.&quot;

&quot;Oh come on, I won&#146;t tell! It&#146;ll be our little secret.&quot; Xu laughed as 
they vanished up the hall.

*********************

Fujin lay flat on her back, staring into the shadows. The only light to 
be had filtered in through small windows high on the walls. Except for 
her, the entire gym was empty. She enjoyed the solitude, enjoyed the 
silence. Raising her legs she stretched lazily, her mind wandering about 
the night before.

&quot;She&#146;s wonderful.&quot;

&quot;To wonderful perhaps?&quot; A twinkle of old paranoia whispered to her but 
was wholly ignored. An idea crept into her mind causing her smile 
inwardly.

&quot;I always liked watching you work out.&quot; A voice said quietly.

&quot;Seifer...&quot; Fujin thought with a sigh.

&quot;SETTLED THIS.&quot; Fujin said gruffly, sitting up. She scanned the shadows 
until she found him. He was wet, obviously having, just returning from 
the pool.

&quot;I know, I couldn&#146;t help but comment.&quot; He smiled.

Rolling her eyes Fujin hopped to her feet and grabbed a towel. She 
wasn&#146;t about to put on a show for him.

&quot;Calm down, I&#146;m about to leave.&quot; He assured her.

&quot;GOOD.&quot; Fujin snipped.

&quot;I mean for good.&quot; He added.

Fujin arched a brow and looked at curiously.

&quot;Cid&#146;s giving me a runabout.&quot;

&quot;GENEROUS.&quot;

&quot;I think I&#146;ll travel, see the world. Perhaps I&#146;ll even join a peace 
group.&quot; He said idly, drying his hair.

&quot;FUNNY.&quot; Fujin scoffed walking past him towards her gear. Kneeling down 
she fished about in her cooler and pulled out a bottle of water. 
&quot;THIRSTY?&quot;

&quot;No thanks. I&#146;m serious though, I think it&#146;ll be interesting.&quot;

&quot;WHY TELL ME?&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t know...&quot;

&quot;SAD.&quot; She huffed, sipping her drink.

&quot;Yeah...I guess it is.&quot;

&quot;WHEN LEAVING?&quot;

&quot;Later tonight, I&#146;m waiting for the waters to calm down a bit.&quot; He 
shrugged. &quot;How&#146;s things with you and um...&quot; He said awkwardly.

&quot;NO BUSINESS.&quot; She scowled.

&quot;Just asking, I see you haven&#146;t changed to much.&quot; He grinned.

&quot;BASTARD.&quot;

&quot;Damn it Fujin, cut me some slack I&#146;m trying to be nice.&quot;

&quot;SMART ASS.&quot;

&quot;No, no...I&#146;m serious. Just tell me you&#146;re happy. It&#146;ll put my mind at 
ease.&quot;

&quot;I AM.&quot; She said bluntly.

&quot;Good...that&#146;s...great actually.&quot; He grinned. &quot;Now that wasn&#146;t so bad 
now was it.&quot;

Fujin wasn&#146;t smiling in the least and Seifer nodded somberly.

&quot;Goodbye Fujin.&quot; He said quietly, slipping past her and into the 
darkness.

********************

&quot;Quistis did that!? I don&#146;t believe you!&quot; Kevin blurted before exploding 
into laughter.

&quot;No really, you should have seen it. She was awesome!&quot; Zell laughed.

&quot;She&#146;s going to kill you.&quot; Nicole noted while threading colored lights 
over an expanse of latticework.

&quot;I wish I was there to see that.&quot; Irvine whistled.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Selphie shouted, loosing her grip on the ladder holding Nicole.

&quot;Watch it!&quot; Nicole yelped steadying herself.

&quot;Sorry...&quot; Selphie squeaked.

&quot;She was awesome...&quot; Rinoa mumbled mockingly.

&quot;You&#146;re just mad because you got in trouble.&quot; Zone said with a grin, 
prompting a laugh from Watts.

&quot;Whose side are you guys on?&quot; Rinoa scowled.

&quot;Sorry Sir.&quot; Watts winced.

&quot;Oops.&quot; Watts shrank back.

&quot;You terrorize your lackeys?&quot; Irvine grinned.

&quot;They&#146;re not my lackeys.&quot; Rinoa sighed, glancing at the duo 
apologetically. &quot;And I don&#146;t terrorize you guys, now do I?&quot;

&quot;Not at all Princess.&quot; Zone and Watts said in unison.

&quot;Great...&quot; Rinoa frowned, as everyone started laughing.

&quot;I&#146;m back with the lights. Sorry it took so long.&quot; Quistis apologized.&quot;

&quot;Cool!&quot; Zell said eagerly as he and Irvine took the lights from her and 
powered them up.

&quot;That should let us see better, long enough to get finished at least.&quot; 
Quistis smirked. &quot;Decided to help out I see.&quot; She said to Kevin with a 
grin.

&quot;Of course, besides it gives me something to do until we leave.&quot; He 
shrugged.

&quot;Welcome aboard then.&quot; She smiled as they got to work. &quot;Oh, before I 
forget...! Zone, I have something for you back at my apartment.&quot; She 
announced, getting his attention.

&quot;M...me!?&quot; The bashful man squeaked.

&quot;Yes, you, just swing by later tonight.&quot; She responded.

Irvine perked up with a grin and was about to speak but Quistis 
intercepted him with a murderous glance. Not to be dissuaded he scurried 
to her side while as she laid out rolls of silverware.

&quot;You have anything for me?&quot; He smiled wolfishly.

&quot;Go away before I tell Selphie.&quot; Quistis smirked.

&quot;Fine, keep the porn to yourself...&quot; He sighed, feigning hurt.

Nicole glanced at the two worriedly and Irvine smiled a toothy grin 
before scampering off like some overdeveloped imp.

&quot;He&#146;s a clown.&quot; Quistis explained awkwardly.

&quot;It&#146;s none of my business...&quot; Nicole said guardedly, quickly moving 
towards Zell.

&quot;Nicole...&quot; Quistis grumbled, giving Irvine a dirty look. He just smiled 
and waved merrily.

&quot;Where&#146;s your shadow?&quot; Rinoa asked, walking up with more silverware.

&quot;Who?&quot; Quistis blinked.

&quot;Fujin.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t know, last I heard she was heading to the gym.&quot;

&quot;You think she&#146;s going to the dance?&quot; Rinoa queried, making small talk.

&quot;Everyone seems worried about that, why?&quot;

&quot;We&#146;ve a bet going.&quot; Rinoa grinned, just trying to get a leg up.

&quot;That&#146;s real mature...and who&#146;s, we?&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s nothing like that.&quot; Rinoa sighed, not wishing to get her worked up 
again.

&quot;Sounds like it to me Rinoa.&quot; Quistis frowned, moving on to the next 
table.

&quot;Some of us in class were just curious, and one thing led to another.&quot; 
Rinoa explained its just innocent fun.

&quot;Are you trying to upset me...&quot; Quistis whispered quietly.

&quot;No...never...we didn&#146;t mean anything by it.&quot;

&quot;What&#146;s with you? You aren&#146;t like this.&quot;

&quot;Like what!?&quot;

&quot;Shallow.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m not.&quot;

&quot;The thing with Ifrit, and now this. You&#146;re an adult now Rinoa, you 
can&#146;t keep playing silly games like this.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s not fair.&quot;

&quot;You have to think about how your actions will effect people.&quot;

&quot;Why are you picking on me...?&quot; Rinoa blurted, louder than she meant to, 
causing several pairs of eyes to glance their way.

&quot;I&#146;m not, I just expect better from you.&quot;

&quot;Why, why me. I&#146;m not trying to impress you.&quot; Rinoa whispered harshly.

&quot;It&#146;s not about impressing anyone Rinoa. It&#146;s about being responsible. 
Look at it this way. You have a lot of trouble heading your way. You&#146;ve 
inherited a great power and with Edea gone your going to have to learn 
to deal with it alone. And I&#146;ll tell you this, it&#146;s not going to be easy 
and it&#146;s not going to be fun. The power I have is child&#146;s play compared 
with what you&#146;ve inherited and it took a long time for me to control 
it.&quot; Quistis took a breath and regarded her sternly.

&quot;You don&#146;t think I can handle it?&quot;

&quot;I just don&#146;t want anything to happen to you Rinoa. I&#146;m only being harsh 
because I care.&quot;

&quot;I guess.&quot; Rinoa sighed.

&quot;I&#146;m serious. Let&#146;s not argue it&#146;s not fun and we&#146;ve been through enough 
drama lately.&quot;

&quot;Okay...&quot;

&quot;Cheer up, I&#146;m here to help you if you&#146;re having problems.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m just screwing up left and right huh... Some SEED I&#146;m turning out to 
be.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t be like that hon, we all make mistakes.&quot; Quistis smiled, 
squeezing her hand companionably.

&quot;I guess so...&quot;

&quot;I know so.&quot; Quistis assured her.

*********************

Seifer made his way to the docks in silence. He decided to leave early, 
not wanting to say goodbye. Not that expected anyone to see him off. 
He&#146;d made arrangements with Nida to have the bay doors open and the 
runabout waiting for him. Making his way along to the small craft he 
paused with a start.

&quot;What do you want Squall...?&quot; He frowned as spied his former rival 
leaning against the bow of the ship.

&quot;Leaving early?&quot; Squall asked dully as Seifer tossed his gear in the 
ships hold.

&quot;Why not.&quot; Seifer grunted.

&quot;Just curious.&quot; Squall said calmly moving out of the way.

&quot;Who told you? Nida?&quot;

&quot;No one, I just know you, so does Fujin.&quot; Squall responded, fishing in 
the pocket of his jacket.

&quot;Cute, so what then, you here to say goodbye or something.&quot;

&quot;Or something.&quot; Squall said, slipping out a photo. &quot;She asked me to give 
you this.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Seifer said with a wary scowl as he took the photo. It was the 
photo of Rajin and her, the same one she kept by her bed. Seifer smiled 
softly and nodded. &quot;Tell her thanks...&quot; He said quietly.

&quot;Tell her yourself when you see her again.&quot; Squall said stoically.

&quot;Squall, we both know that&#146;s not going to happen.&quot; Seifer grinned, 
tossing the last of the bags on board.

&quot;I know...&quot; Squall nodded grimly.

Seifer tucked the photo inside his coat and looked at Squall wordlessly.

Squall offered his hand stiffly to him much to Seifer&#146;s surprise. 
Looking at it a moment Seifer took the hand then pulled Squall to him. 
Caught totally off guard Squall found himself in a vice like bear hug. 
With a hearty laugh, Seifer abruptly let go and jumped aboard the ship 
as Squall staggered back catching his breath.

&quot;See you around Squall! Take care of this place or I&#146;ll have to come 
back and teach you a lesson!&quot; He proclaimed loudly and gunned the ship&#146;s 
engines. With a roar the small craft spun around, spraying Squall with 
water and knocking him over. By the time he got to his feet, the ship 
and Seifer were gone into the night. Squall coughed and looked around in 
bewilderment before breaking out into laughter.

*************************

Quistis hurried to the door as soon as the knocking started. Opening it 
she grinned slightly.

&quot;Hey Zone.&quot; Then she noticed Watts, Irvine and Kevin with him. &quot;Um 
guys...&quot; She nodded graciously to the trio. Irvine gave a goofy grin and 
took his hat off.

&quot;Ma&#146;am.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re going to die...&quot; She hissed under her breath at him as they 
entered.

&quot;Zone seemed excited, so Irvine suggested we tag along to see what the 
fuss was about.&quot;

&quot;I bet he did.&quot; Quistis sneered, picking up a fair sized cardboard box.

&quot;Here you go Zone, I owed you one so... um... enjoy...&quot; She stammered 
awkwardly as Irvine made lewd faces and gestures behind him.

&quot;For me?&quot; Zone said shakily. &quot;Um...wow...what is it...?&quot; He wondered 
aloud tearing at the tape.

&quot;Why don&#146;t you do that in your room.&quot; Quistis yawned. &quot;I&#146;m about to 
crash.&quot;

&quot;Oh...um...okay...thanks....&quot; He gurgled.

&quot;Ah shoot Quistis let the man thank you proper, open it up there guy.&quot; 
Irvine chuckled, clapping Zone on the back.

&quot;Yeah Quistis, why rush us off, don&#146;t you want to see his face?&quot; Kevin 
said curiously. Another foul and scathing look was shot to Irvine as 
Quistis sat down heavily on the couch.

&quot;Sure...why not.&quot;

Another knock on the door and Quistis cringed.

&quot;I&#146;ll get it!&quot; Irvine said in a bubbly tone.

&quot;Oh...its you...&quot; He sighed in disappointment.

Fujin looked up at him sourly then shoved past. Looking around she 
arched a brow.

&quot;INTERRUPTING?&quot; She asked curiously, glancing at the gathering.

&quot;Nope, just giving Zone his present.&quot; Quistis sighed heavily. She could 
already feel a royal headache coming.

Finally getting the box open Zone peeked inside. The noise he made was 
somewhat indescribable, something between a squeal and a giddy scream.

&quot;Hyne...&quot; Quistis blushed burying her head in her hands.

&quot;What is it Sir?&quot; Watts asked, peeking over Zone&#146;s shoulder. &quot;Oh 
goodness...&quot; He blinked then moved away.

Irvine leaned over and shook his head in mock disappointment.

&quot;Porn!? Qusity...how could you...&quot; He sighed.

&quot;Whoa...&quot; Kevin gawked and staggered back from the box of skin 
magazines.

Fujin glanced at the box and looked at Zone with disdain. His response 
was a foul smelling belch that sent her reeling.

&quot;RAGE!&quot; Disgusted and offended, she tensed to hit him.

&quot;WHOA!&quot; Irvine shouted grabbing her up off the ground before she could 
hit him.

Watts screamed and ran behind Kevin who stood aghast.

Quistis looked wide-eyed for a moment then burst into laughter.

&quot;Sorry...&quot; Zone squeaked in embarrassment then doubled over as his ulcer 
ravaged him.

&quot;RELEASE NOW!&quot; Fujin roared.

&quot;Fujin calm down.&quot; Quistis giggled, getting her attention.

&quot;3!&quot; Fujin counted.

&quot;Irvine set her down.&quot; Quistis warned with a waning smirk.

&quot;2!&quot; Fujin said simply.

&quot;Not until she promises to be nice.&quot; Irvine said simply

&quot;She will, won&#146;t you Fujin.&quot; Quistis pleaded.

&quot;1!&quot; Was Fujin&#146;s reply.

&quot;Thanks for the...gift...&quot; Zone gargled.

With a growl Fujin brought her hand down and firmly wrapped it around 
Irvine&#146;s crotch. He made a high pitched noise and loosened his grip.

&quot;RELEASE.&quot; Fujin hissed, threatening to squeeze harder.

&quot;Ew...&quot; Quistis groaned. The other three men in the room looked 
horrified and moved back.

&quot;Let go...&quot; Irvine grunted, setting her down gently.

&quot;HUMPF!&quot; Fujin scowled, looking at everyone foully before going to the 
kitchen to wash her hand. Irvine wiggled slightly to make sure 
everything was okay. Thankful she didn&#146;t hurt him he let out a sigh of 
relief.

&quot;You know if you wanted to check me out all you had to do was ask.&quot; He 
called to her jokingly.

&quot;OUT!&quot; Quistis shouted, before more chaos erupted. Everyone scattered as 
she started shoving and pushing in annoyance.

&quot;I&#146;ll talk to you tomorrow?&quot; Kevin asked as she ushered him out.

&quot;I&#146;ll think about it...&quot; Quistis snapped.

&quot;Um...thanks...&quot; Zone said meekly, his mind racing with questions.

&quot;Yeah...you&#146;re welcome...&quot; Quistis groaned and shut the door.

Glancing up she noticed Fujin staring at her sourly.

&quot;YOUR HOME.&quot; She started with a frown. &quot;IS CIRCUS.&quot;

&quot;Sorry Fu... Blame Irvine.&quot;

&quot;HE IS BIG CHILD.&quot;

&quot;I know...&quot;

&quot;CUT HAND OFF.&quot; Fujin grumbled looking at her hand distastefully.

&quot;You&#146;re not touching me with it anymore.&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;THAT SO?&quot; Fujin grinned, moving towards her threateningly.
