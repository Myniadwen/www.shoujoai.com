<p align="center">Drunk on  Coffee</p>
<p>Irvine walked through  the door and the immediate thought that came into his mind was why it  was so dark. All he could hear was the incessant clicking of keys and  the dim light in the next room.</p>
<p>“Er…hello?” He  asked, walking in. He didn’t think that anyone would be in his  room, nor did he know how they got in. Just to be on the safe side,  he decided to draw his gun. He peeked into the room. “Selphie!”  He nearly dropped the gun when he saw her at his desk typing  furiously on the computer.</p>
<p>“Hey Irvine.” She  replied automatically.</p>
<p>“What are you doing  here and how did you get in?” He demanded.</p>
<p>“Searching for Arik  I had no computer, through the window, sorry I smashed it.” She  droned on with absolutely no tone in her voice at all. Irvine took  off his hat and scratched his head.</p>
<p>“Arik? Wait…you  mean Instructor Arik?”</p>
<p>“Yup.” Same  monotone voice.</p>
<p>“He’s dead.”</p>
<p>“Nope. Aya said  something about government conspiracy; the SeeD that went missing  might not be dead. So now I’m looking.” She bit her lip.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think  that these matters should be left maybe untouched? We’re kinda  stepping over our bounds you know…” He said nervously.</p>
<p>“You want to see  Quistis happy, right? It wouldn’t hurt to try.” She snapped,  finally showing some emotion.</p>
<p>“Yeah, sure I want  to see Quisty happy but I’m not sure this is the correct…”</p>
<p>“Good, then it’s  settled. Now, pull up a chair and take over, my eyes are about to  fall out.” Selphie said, standing up and walking over the kitchen.  “I’ll make us some coffee and cookies, it’s going to be a long  night.” Irvine sighed and inched closer to the screen. It was  hardly the romantic dinner that he had dreamed of.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>On the other hand,  Quistis and Xu shared a more romantic dinner than either of them  could’ve predicted. They ate quietly, enjoying the comfort of each  other’s presence. It wasn’t an awkward silence, but the getting  used to of each other. The two would glance up every now and then  shyly, almost as if they were back to secretly admiring each other.</p>
<p>“You know, one of us  is bound to comment on exactly how burnt the chicken turned out,  right?” Quistis teased. Xu flushed and pouted.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t my  fault! You were supposed to tell me when you smelled smoke!”</p>
<p>“I was too busy  trying to cook the vegetables just right to notice! It was your duty.  It’s not my fault someone didn’t learn how to keep track of time,  constantly dozing off in class way back in the day.” Quistis  giggled. Xu got up and walked away. “What…hey…” At the last  moment, Xu whirled around and locked her arms around the baffled  instructor’s neck.</p>
<p>“Someone’s hungry  for punishment.” She hissed in her ear. Quistis froze but managed  to croak out,</p>
<p>“Better than burnt  chicken anyway.” There was a tense moment before Xu got up again,  smiling wickedly.</p>
<p>“Hm…maybe another  time. We need to do dishes after all.” Quistis paused for a moment,  trying to take in what just occurred. As Xu was just about to  disappear into the kitchen, she decided there would be no more games.  They had gone on teasing long enough and if either of them were  scared, it was up to her to quell that fear.</p>
<p>“Xu?” She said,  getting up. The brunette turned around just in time to meet Quistis  in mid-kiss. They wrapped their arms around each other, no longer  daring to let go for fear that it would never happen again. When they  finally did break apart, they did it slowly, opening their eyes with  caution.</p>
<p>“Now…” Quistis  panted. “What do you think of that?”</p>
<p>“I’m certainly not  going to tease you anymore…” Xu replied. The two smiled.  “Quistis…is everything ok?”</p>
<p>“Are you talking  about the voice?” She asked. The silence that followed was yes  enough. “I can feel a little of its anger. But it’s only because  he’s jealous. But this is our night. We can’t let it by like  this.”</p>
<p>There came a sudden  knocking on the door. The two stepped away, Xu muttering a sharp  curse under her breath before going over to the door and pulling it  open.</p>
<p>“WHAT!” She  demanded. Zell shrunk back with a little “meep.” He could’ve  sworn that if he had made eye contact, he would’ve burst into  flames.</p>
<p>“Wondering…Quistis…whar…?”  he babbled.</p>
<p>“I’m here Zell.”  The martial artist heaved a sigh, good at least she would be  friendly.</p>
<p>“Great Instru…”  He was instantly cut off by an equally cold glare that floored him.  He shrunk back, wondering when they were going to lop his head off  and stick it on the Balamb Garden flagpole. What did he do wrong?</p>
<p>“Squall…wanted…you…bad.”  The cold glare was instantly replaced with an awkward blush.</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”  Quistis asked. Now that he was short one death glare, Zell began  speaking normally again.</p>
<p>“I mean, that’s  not what I meant. I meant he’s wondering when you’re going to be  back with teaching and stuff. I mean, you’ve been out for a while  and the substitute isn’t, how should you say, too educational?”  He replied.</p>
<p>“Well, she’s not  exactly in fit condition you know, especially after the ordeal. Is  Squall really all that heartless?” Xu demanded.</p>
<p>“No…he’s really  concerned…”</p>
<p>“When does he want  me back?” Quistis asked, stepping in.</p>
<p>“Soon as possible.”  Zell answered.</p>
<p>“How does three days  sound?” Zell nodded.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell him  that, ok?” He waved and walked off down the hall but he couldn’t  help feeling that Xu was going to jump him at any moment. But it  wasn’t him that Xu wanted to jump.</p>
<p>“Three days!” Xu  exclaimed. “You’re going to kill yourself! Damn it Quistis…”</p>
<p>“Xu, I don’t want  to hear your complaining. I should be ok in three days, it wasn’t  anything serious.”</p>
<p>“Oh, right, so  nearly getting killed and being weak on your feet is nothing serious,  eh? Quistis, by Hyne…”</p>
<p>“I just don’t  think it’s fair to this year’s students if they don’t pass this  year’s exam because I was negligent.”<br />
  “Negligent!  NEGLIGENT! YOU NEARLY DIED! HOW IS THAT NEGLIGENT!” Qusitis  frowned.</p>
<p>“You’re acting  like I don’t know what’s good for me.”</p>
<p>“I really do believe  that you don’t know what’s good for you. If you get seriously  hurt or sick because you are a workaholic, I don’t know what I’d  do.”</p>
<p>“You’re being  selfish, Xu. I’m not placed in this world solely to make you happy.  And I don’t want to argue with you. Not now.” She pulled Xu close  and as much as Xu worried, she couldn’t help but forget just a  little that there was a day after that night. She lost herself to  Quistis’s gentle kisses again.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“Squall, we never  go out anymore…” Rinoa whined, leaning on her chair. Squall  groaned, his entire office covered with paperwork.</p>
<p>“You don’t say…”  He replied, gesturing to all the mountains of paper around him. Rinoa  stood up and draped an arm around her.</p>
<p>“You know, Xu and  Quistis go out more than we do.” She whispered.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that great  for them?” Squall said in return. Rinoa pouted.</p>
<p>“Do you even know  what tomorrow is?” She demanded.</p>
<p>“Anniversary. Ours.  Been a year since we started dating, a year, three months and two  days since we met.” He replied. Rinoa blinked and moved away.</p>
<p>“Oh…well…that’s  good that you know then.” Squall looked up and wrapped his arms  around her waist.</p>
<p>“I have  reservations, don’t worry.” He whispered, bringing her close.  Rinoa raised an eyebrow in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Well then…that’s  interesting.” She brushed his hair back and saw an angry red cut.  “Uh…Squall, where’d you get this?” He sighed.</p>
<p>“A rock flew out of  nowhere and nearly killed me.” He replied. “Now, you’d better  leave me alone until tomorrow, I’ve got to clear this all.” He  let her go. Rinoa jumped in the air for joy and planted a kiss on  Squall’s cheek before skipping out of there, giddy as could be.  Squall waited a moment before shoving a giant pile of papers to the  side with violent aggression to grab his phone.</p>
<p>“Irvine. I need your  help. Yeah, you have connections with that fancy restaurant guy in  Deling, right? …I don’t care which one! Just hook me up with  one!”</p>
<p>-</p>

<p>Quistis dried her eyes  after the movie had ended. No matter how many times she saw it, just  seeing Jenna running away from the final battle, waiting until the  smoke cleared to see if Walter had survived was a tearjerker. She  stayed there for a good two days, doing nothing but waiting for him  to walk out of the smoke. But sadly…he wouldn’t. But she waited  until she withered away and died and the final scene of the movie was  her drifting off into death, and just as she died, she saw the  outline of a man walking out of the smoke.</p>
<p>“Xu…Xu pass me the  tissue box…” She sniffed. No response. “Xu?” She looked over  to see a snoring Xu. She grabbed a pillow and bashed her over the  head with it.</p>
<p>“WAH?” She woke  up with a start, jumping into a ready battle stance. Seeing Quistis  lapse into a fit of giggles made her drop her arms and stare. “What  was that for?”</p>
<p>“You!” Quistis  grew serious. “You missed the greatest and most emotional movie  there ever was. How could you?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean to  fall asleep! I just kinda did!” She said. “If you hadn’t been  so busy crying your eyes out, you would’ve seen how bored I was.  That movie was horrible.”<br />
  “You have horrible taste!”  Quistis retorted. “I’ll have you know it won 10 Oskars!”</p>
<p>“Gee, with a title  of ‘Smoking the Past’ I never would’ve guessed.”</p>
<p>“Ok, so the titled  sucked. But it’s a really good movie that I swear I’m going to  make you see one day.” Quistis yawned and stretched, looking over  at the clock. It was already one.</p>
<p>“Lucky I don’t  have desk duty tomorrow.” Xu sighed.</p>
<p>“I’d best be  getting back.” Quistis said, popping the tape out of the video  player. But before she had a chance to even turn around, her legs  gave in and Xu rushed in to catch her.</p>
<p>“You’re not going  anywhere. You’ve pushed yourself too hard today. If you’re going  to get back to work in three days, you’d best stay here for the  night.” She replied sternly. Quistis raised an eyebrow  suggestively.</p>
<p>“So…what do you  want from me?” Xu blinked in confusion before her cheeks turned  flaming red.</p>
<p>“Not like that!”  She quickly rejected the idea. “Good Hyne, Quisty…I’m saying  you should rest, not overexert yourself…” Quistis looked around.</p>
<p>“So…I guess I’ll  take the couch?” She tried to move but Xu wouldn’t let go.</p>
<p>“There’s enough  room on the bed for the two of us.” Now it was the Instructor’s  turn to blush heavily. “I’m serious…nothing like that. It would  just be nice to know that you’re here and alive again.” Quistis  leaned back against her and sighed softly. It had been such a long  time since she felt any comfort.</p>
<p>“Agreed then.” The  two of them changed into their pajamas and curled up in bed, Quistis  tucked safe inside the arms of Xu. The two of them drifted without  any thoughts, more peacefully than they had before.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Zell lay on his bed,  trying to figure out what in Hyne’s name he did wrong. He sighed  and rolled over, hugging his teddy bear. (A/N: …I had to…I just  had to…) He could understand that the two were just patching up  their friendship and that any interruption would be unwelcome but  that was a totally extreme reaction.</p>
<p>“Zell? You in here?”  Ayane’s voice came through the door. Moments later, she stepped in.  Zell rolled over again and groaned into the pillow. “Hey, what’s  wrong?” She asked, sitting down on the side of the bed. She placed  her arm around his waist and looked down in concern.</p>
<p>“Nothing’s wrong.  I’m just trying to think.”<br />
  “Well, that certainly is a  change.” Ayane giggled, snatching the teddy bear away.</p>
<p>“Hey! Give that  back!” He rose suddenly, tackling her. Ayane laughed, expecting him  to kiss her but instead, he took the bear back and started kissing  the bear. She frowned.</p>
<p>“You love that bear  more than you do me.” She pouted. Zell gave her a puppy dog face  before kissing her on the cheek shyly. “That’s better.”</p>
<p>“Everyone’s  picking on me today…” he sighed. “Instructor Trepe and scary Xu  yelled at me for disturbing their ‘girl moment.’”</p>
<p>“Well of course they  yelled at you. They’re not exactly too happy about having their  special night disturbed. I mean honestly, Quistis has just suffered  through an ordeal and you go and deliver the news that Quistis is  expected back at work as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“It’s not my fault  though! It’s Squall’s!” He insisted.</p>
<p>“That’s true. But  they couldn’t vent on Squall since he wasn’t there.”</p>
<p>“That’s not  fair…so they pick on me?” Ayane hugged him and smiled.</p>
<p>“It’s ok. They’ll  return to their senses and remember just how cuddly you are.” She  joked. He folded his arms, and tucked his bear even closer. She  encircled her arms around his waist and put her chin onto his  shoulder. He was so fun to tease sometimes, especially since his  reactions resembled that of a 5 year old child. But she loved him  nonetheless. He was her adorable martial artist. It was already late  into the night and she was ready to fall asleep, regardless of whose  room she was in. She yawned and closed her eyes. Zell said nothing  until he felt her arms go loose and then he looked back.</p>
<p>“Aya?” He  whispered. She was sleeping peacefully. He sighed and removed her  arms, gently picking her up; not that it mattered. Ayane could sleep  though the entire Balamb Garden shifting and crashing and not wake  up. He set her down on his bed and drew the covers up, making sure  she was warm. <em>Great…couch again.</em> He thought sadly before  stumbling over to the lumpy uncomfortable piece of furniture.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p><em>Damn it…I need to  find them…where could they be? I need to warn them. I need…I need  to stop them before everything goes wrong. I just hope he hasn’t  made contact yet…I just hope…</em>A figure ran through the rain,  trying to avoid any and all fights. Alone, the figure stumbled,  trying to seek out the Balamb Garden.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“Edea…dear…what’s  troubling you?” Cid asked as they sat on the white SeeD ship taking  them to the orphanage. Edea stood on the deck, leaning against the  rail with a troubled expression on her face. “Please don’t tell  me you’re worried about Adel…she seems perfectly civilized and…”</p>
<p>“It’s not her.  It’s Quistis that I fear for.” Edea sighed. “Quistis has had to  suffer through so much in her entire lifetime. Yet she’s always  managed to keep a straight face, never once crying too much or giving  up. Despite all the trouble, she pushes herself hard and I fear too  hard. Now…now that she has sorceress powers…I can only hope that  she won’t deteriorate from all this pressure.”</p>
<p>“Like you’ve said,  she’s strong. She’ll make it. Besides, she has wonderful friends  to help her along the way.”</p>
<p>“More than that.”  Edea smiled cryptically. “But let’s go inside, the air is getting  chilly.” She walked past her flustered husband and down below where  Adel slept peacefully like the child she looked like.</p>
