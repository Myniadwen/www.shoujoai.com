<p align="center">Rain, Rain Go Away</p>
<p>Quistis and  Xu finally made it to the house but when they could just see it in the horizon,  it began raining heavily.</p>
<p>“Hyne!”  Quistis shrieked as it poured down on them like no tomorrow. Xu laughed and  they ran towards the house. “Of all the times to be raining…and it was so  beautiful this morning!”</p>
<p>“Calm  before the storm.” Xu giggled. Quistis shot her a mean glare.</p>
<p>“Since when  did you like the rain?” She snapped.</p>
<p>“Since I  saw you so angry at it!” She ran ahead, leaving Quistis fuming in playful  anger. She caught up but didn’t intend to outrun her best friend. She tackled  her into the mud. Xu let out a cry out surprise and rolled Quistis over.</p>
<p>“I hate  you!” She yelled, getting up and observing the damage she had done to their  clothes. Quistis giggled like mad, her mud smeared face trembling with  laughter. She sprinted towards the house, determined to lock her out. Xu  quickly saw what she was doing and ran towards her. The two of them made it at  the same time and flung the door open, landing on the steps in a heap of dirt,  water and laughter. They lay there for some time before getting up and studying  each other. Xu couldn’t help but stare. Most of the mud had washed off as they  ran through the rain but their clothers were a mess. Quistis’s hair stuck to  her face and Xu couldn’t pry her eyes away. She looked…beautiful. Xu couldn’t  stop herself as she reached out with one hand to push the hair gently away.  Quistis stared at her in a mixture of confusion and joy.</p>
<p>“Er…we  should take a shower.” Xu said, feeling very awkward. Quistis smiled at her,  cocking her head to one side but decided to let the subject drop. Xu led her  upstairs and into the bedroom. Next to it was the bathroom. She walked over the  drawer and picked out some clothes.</p>
<p>“It might  fit.” She said, handing a white t-shirt with the words, “Good Girl” on the front  in giant pink letters and also a pair of blue sweat pants.. She picked out a  plain black shirt and denim shorts. By the time she turned around, the door  closed and locked.</p>
<p>“Hey!” She  yelled. “I was going to go first!” The only answer was a light-hearted giggle  from the other side of the door. Xu frowned and put her hands on her hips.</p>
<p>Quistis  leaned against the door, not really sure what to think. Xu had always been her  best friend. But she could feel it within herself that there was something  different.</p>
<p><em>Surely  not…</em>she thought to herself. <em>I’m just looking for comfort.</em> She sighed  and walked into the shower, only to jump back out.</p>
<p>“XU!” She  screamed. The water was boiling hot. Downstairs, Xu broke into a fit of giggles  as she let the cold water run into the sink. She turned off the water and let  Quistis go on with her shower. Xu smiled fondly, they hadn’t played such fun  pranks in a long time. When they were kids, they were always out to get one  another or the teachers. But now, they were grown up, a little more mature, and  a little more creative when it came to new pranks.</p>
<p>As soon as  Quistis was done, she stepped out of the room and stormed over to Xu, who was  reading a dated magazine.</p>
<p>“Ha ha,”  she droned. “Very funny, making me burn myself.”</p>
<p>“Was that  me?” Xu asked innocently. Quistis tapped her fingers on the table and glared at  Xu until she burst out laughing.</p>
<p>“You  should’ve heard yourself!” Xu laughed. “I’ve never heard you scream so loudly!”  Quistis shrugged and then promptly assaulted her with a tickle attack. Knowing  that Xu was immensely ticklish, Quistis used this to her advantage.</p>
<p>“Ack! No  stop!” Xu pleaded, tears streaming down her eyes from laughing so hard. Quistis  wouldn’t relent and the chair fell over backwards, dragging both of them to the  ground. Xu hit her head on the floor and came dangerously close to Quistis’s  face. She froze, turning pale and then bright red. They stopped for a few  seconds, which seemed like an eternity, and then stood up.</p>
<p>“You ok?”  Quistis asked.</p>
<p>“Um…yeah…”  Xu stammered, looking away. <em>She’s acting weird again…</em>Quistis thought  with a smile. Something was definitely up with Xu and she was determined to  find out what. Xu rushed off to take a shower. Quistis sat in the kitchen and  wondered what her best friend could be hiding.</p>
<p><em>Kill…</em></p>
<p>Quistis  jumped in shock. She immediately recognized that voice. It was the same voice  that had assaulted her mind the day before. She looked around.</p>
<p>“Who’s  there?” She demanded.</p>
<p><em>Kill…Quistis…Die…</em></p>
<p>It knew her  name. She felt goose bumps forming on her arms.</p>
<p><em>Die…Quistis…Kill…</em></p>
<p>Quistis  took a deep breath. She would find out what this disembodied voice wanted from  her. She accepted the fear and waited.</p>
<p><em>If you live…you will cause  everyone…pain…so…die.</em></p>
<p>“Die! Just  leave me alone!” She yelled. She was going insane. It was probably her  subconscious…the part she wanted to bury away forever. It was the part of her  that nearly killed herself years ago. But what if it wasn’t her? What if it…</p>
<p><em>Quistis  must die.</em></p>
<p>“No!”  Quistis shrieked as the voice seemed to tear right into her heart and soul. She  stood up and clutched her head, wanting the voice to go away. She stumbled  around, unable to concentrate.</p>
<p><em>DIE!</em></p>
<p>She crashed  into the dish rack and plates fell, cutting her arms and legs as they  shattered. She welcomed the pain because it gave her something else to  concentrate on. Xu ran downstairs, clad in a towel.</p>
<p>“Quistis!”  She shouted, worried. As soon as she entered the kitchen, her heart sank.  Quisits was staring at the ground with a blank expression. Blood seeped from  cuts on her arms and legs. “QUISTIS!” Quistis turned and looked at Xu with eyes  that showed no recognition. Suddenly, she ran and buried her face into Xu’s  shoulder, sobbing loudly. Xu held on as well, squeezing hard as if hoping to  have the pain Quisits was suffering seep into her.</p>
<p>“I…I’m  sorry Xu…”</p>
<p>“Shh…I’m  here.” Xu could feel her own tears trail down her cheek. “It’s ok…”</p>
<p>Xu soothed  Quistis to sleep eventually, the young woman looking scared and alone as a  child. She stroked her hair, calming the sobs that wracked her body until she  fell into a deep slumber.</p>
<p>“I’ll  always be here for you.” She whispered. Now that most of the crisis was over,  she wondered what had happened. She was still clad in just a towel and she  didn’t make any move to change since Quistis had fallen asleep in with her head  in her lap. She sighed and leaned against the couch, not feeling cold. She  looked down at Quistis and smiled a little. The poor girl was still suffering  in her sleep. Xu began humming a little. It was the first song she knew. The  orphanage that she attended had a very kind older girl who always stayed by her  side. She was a timid little girl in the orphanage, always being picked on for  being sickly and frail. But that older girl, Rebecca, stuck up for her. She  would always hum a song until Xu fell asleep. Sadly, all that changed when Becca died and she wound up at the Garden.</p>
<p>Now she  knew what Rebecca must’ve felt like all those nights when Xu cried in her  sleep. She stroked Quistis’s cheek.</p>
<p><em>I love  her.</em> The thought invaded her mind like an unexpected visitor. It wasn’t  unpleasant but it was sudden and shocked her so much that she almost stood up.  Instead, she bit her bottom lip. She could neither confirm nor deny the  thought. There was definitely something more than friendship that lingered in  her heart but was it strong enough to be called love? Surely not…after all…they  had just picked up the pieces of their previous relationship. There hadn’t been  enough time for her to fall in love.</p>
<p><em>Time is  of no consequence to the heart.</em> She remembered hearing that one time. Xu  struggled with the emotions that tore through her. She tried to sort them out  but only ended up mixing them together even more. Friendship, love, lust, all  of them were frighteningly similar to her at that point. She had never fallen  in love before, how could she tell? But her heart ached and yearned.</p>
<p><em>What is  love?</em> She wondered. She shook her head furiously. <em>What do I do?</em> Up  until now, she had just pushed away that feeling but the silence left her to  think. She leaned her head back against the couch again and closed her eyes. <em>Do  I really love her, or is this just…</em>She couldn’t think of what else it could  be. She loved Quistis dearly but this was a new area of it, an area she thought  she never could’ve crossed. <em>I can’t bother her now with something as trivial  as this. Not when she’s already suffering from something I don’t even know  about.</em> She looked down at Quistis, smelling the shampoo that Quistis used.  It was a rosemary shampoo that Xu had bought way back when she first arrived  and had left it there. She could think of no other person who suited it as well  as Quistis did.</p>
<p>Xu never  really understood what the fuss was about at the Garden. Some of the students  were extreme homophobes, always bashing on gays and lesbians. Xu couldn’t think  of why they would do such a thing, after all, they were only human and wanted  to fall in love. But she didn’t think she’d be in such a position. It could  pose problems later on. There were so many reasons why she did not want to  explore further into this thing called love, especially with Quistis but it all  felt so right at the same time. Quistis murmured in her sleep and turn around  so that her face was turn up at Xu. She sighed and the rhythmic breathing  lulled her to sleep.</p>
<p>Zell’s  snoring kept Ayane up for the better half of the night. Normally, she was used  to such noise but today seemed different. There was so much to do at the Shumi  Village and cranky old Squall only gave them a day. She had barely finished  admiring the new statue of Laguna when Zell pulled her away. The Shumi people  were friendly and the Moombas were nothing short of astonishing. She rolled  over and placed her arm over Zell, deciding that she would have to convince him  to take her another time.</p>
<p>Selphie  wandered the hallways, knowing full well that it was past curfew. She couldn’t  get any sleep. She walked outside, admiring the stars before seeing Rinoa not  too far away.</p>
<p>“Hey.” She  whispered, waving at her. Rinoa paid her no mind. Selphie tilted her head in  confusion and walked closer. “Hey!” She hissed, placing a hand on Rinoa’s  shoulder. The effect was instantaneous. Rinoa grabbed her by both of her  shoulders.</p>
<p>“WHY!” She  all but yelled. “RESISTANCE IS FUTILE! I WILL RISE!” Selphie twisted out of  her grasp and stumbled back. “KURSE ALL OF YOU…”Rinoa slumped onto her knees.  Selphie was frightened, no sure whether or not to call someone for help.  Rinoa’s head turned up, the anger not there.</p>
<p>“Hey  Selphie, what’s up? What are you doing out here? What am I doing out here?” She  asked, looking around in confusion. Selphie decided that it was safe to  approach her friend again.</p>
<p>“What was  that?” She demanded. Rinoa only looked more confused. “You just yelled at me in  some freaky voice!”</p>
<p>“I did? I  don’t remember…” Rinoa bit her lip. “Maybe it’s stress. Squall told me that  happened once too…maybe I should go see Dr. Kadowaki.” Selphie nodded furiously  and grabbed her hand.</p>
<p>“Let’s go  right now.” She said, dragging her along.</p>
<p>“It’s  normal for a sorceress to experience such out of body things.” Dr. Kadowaki  said all too calmly. Selphie wasn’t too fond of the calmness. “She’s bound to  be affected by the powers. After all, Edea was too.”</p>
<p>“So you’re  saying Ultimecia is trying to control me again?” Rinoa replied, her lip  quivering.</p>
<p>“No, I’m  just saying that sometimes your powers take control temporarily. It’s natural  so long as you’re a sorceress. Don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>“How can I  not worry about it? I might end up hurting someone!” Rinoa yelled.</p>
<p>“I don’t  think they would go so far as that. My theory is that since Ultimecia is around,  your sorceress powers react. Simple as that. But you should be fine so long as  you don’t space out for long periods of time.”</p>
<p>“Rinoa  isn’t too good at that.” Selphie giggled. Rinoa shot her a dark glare. She  couldn’t help but feel that this wasn’t normal…</p>
<p>Quistis  stirred and found her “pillow” to be a bit uneven. She opened her eyes and sat  up. She gasped a little after realizing that she had fallen asleep in Xu’s lap.  Poor Xu, she still wasn’t wearing anything but a towel. <em>She cares so much…I  wish I could repay her…</em>She yawned a little and then sat still, smiling. Xu  looked a little troubled since she didn’t get much sleep. Quistis stood up and  stretched, deciding to make breakfast for them both. She went to the bathroom  to freshen up and comb her hair and then went directly to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Xu awoke  after she slipped along the back of the couch and hit her head on the lamp on  the stand. She blinked woozily and sighed. The absence of the weight on her  legs told her that Quistis had woken up and the smell of eggs and toast meant  she was making breakfast. She walked upstairs and dressed, feeling a little  silly wearing just a towel.</p>
<p>“Hey,” she  said, walking in. Quistis looked away from the pan and waved. “So…” Xu didn’t  know how to begin a conversation after last night.</p>
<p>“About that  incident…” Quistis cut in. “Thank you for being so considerate…” She flashed a  gentle smile that made Xu blush slightly.</p>
<p>“Ah…what  are best friends for?” She laughed, trying to shrug it off. “Anyway, I really  wasn’t expecting yesterday to be how we spent your birthday. The presents are  still in the trunk…and the cake too.” Quistis smiled.</p>
<p>“Don’t  worry, we’ll get it today if you want.” She suggested.</p>
<p>“No  problem…but let’s call up and get someone to ship us a car or something. Or  maybe we should contact Zell and have him fly over here to help us out.” Xu  replied.</p>
<p>“I think we  should call Zell. Anyway, breakfast is ready so…” She flipped the eggs onto the  plate and placed it in front of Xu. She ate quietly, not knowing what to say  after coming to terms with herself that she loved Quistis. And Quistis was too  observant to let her go.</p>
<p>“What’s  wrong with you?” She asked. Xu shook her head.</p>
<p>“Nothing.”  She replied with a sigh.</p>
<p>“It’s about  me isn’t it?” Quistis whispered. Xu almost jumped and her head jerked upwards.  Quistis bit her lip. “I’ve seen how you look at me.”</p>
<p>“Y-you  have?” Xu stammered.</p>
<p>“I know  what you’re thinking. I feel the same way.” She offered a small smile. Xu  nearly choked from shock.</p>
<p>“Quistis…?”  Quistis took a step forward.</p>
<p>“Xu, you  have to believe me when I say that I’m not crazy. I know you think I am…and I  sometimes believe it too but I need you to support me right now. You look at me  as if I’m in need of help but I’m not. I just need the support of my best  friend until I figure this out.” Xu’s heart plummeted. So Quistis wasn’t  implying what she had hoped she was implying but nonetheless she smiled back.</p>
<p>“I  understand. I don’t think you’re crazy. I just think you’re stressed out but I’m  here for you, crazy or not.” She replied, standing up and embracing her.  Quistis smiled.</p>
<p>“Thanks,  Heart.”</p>
<p>“Heart…do  you know how much I hate that name? I wish I was King but nooo, Dr. Kadowaki  had to give it to you, perfect Quisty.” Xu joked. Quistis pulled away.</p>
<p>“What?  You’re just jealous because I can beat you.”</p>
<p>“Nu uh…” Xu  replied, giggling. “Cuz I’ve got your card.” Quistis’s eyes widened a little.</p>
<p>“How did  you get that?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s  a funny thing…Squall felt like Rinoa was getting jealous because had your card  and Selphie’s card and he used them a lot. So he gave the Selphie card to  Irvine and since the Trepies were all dying for the Quistis card, he gave it to  me to spare him any trouble.”</p>
<p>“I want  that card!” Quistis said, sitting down and whipping out her deck. Xu smiled and  sat down as well.</p>
<p>“Fine.  Let’s play and see who really is the best, Miss ‘King.’”</p>
<p>Squall  lumbered into the cafeteria, nearly tripping over the stairs as he walked  towards the others. Selphie waved but Rinoa stopped her.</p>
<p>“Now  remember, not a word to Squall about last night. He’ll have a fit.” She hissed  and Selphie nodded, not really wanting to bring up the subject anyway. She  acted as normal as possible and in Squall’s half-asleep state, he couldn’t  really tell the difference.</p>
<p>“Things  sure are different without Quisty around.” She sighed. Everyone murmured in  agreement. “But she’s going to be back soon and then we can bug her again.”  Zell swallowed the remains of his hotdog.</p>
<p>“Xu’s been  hogging her.” He whined.</p>
<p>“Well you  can’t blame her. The two of them have been friends since forever. It wouldn’t  be right that we just swooped in and took her away.” Rinoa replied. Zell kept  whining while Ayane played with his hair. Squall downed a glass of coffee and  promptly regretted it. He spat it out all over the table.</p>
<p>“What the  heck are those lunch ladies trying to do!” he yelled. “The coffee’s scalding  hot!” Everyone threw napkins onto the table in an effort to clean it up.</p>
<p>“You’re  fault for not being careful. Besides, you’re awake now aren’t you?” Rinoa  countered. “Serves you right for snoring too loudly last night.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t  matter.” He snapped irritably and settled down. Rinoa giggled and cast Selphie  an amused glance. It was a shame that both of them knew the smile they had were  facades.</p>
<p>“Ha! I  win!” Quistis proclaimed proudly.</p>
<p>“I demand a  rematch!” Xu protested.</p>
<p>“No way.  I’m keeping my card.” She giggled and plucked the Quistis card from Xu’s hand.  Xu reacted too late to stop her. “Now you understand why they call me ‘King.’”  Xu crossed her arms and pouted.</p>
<p>“Damn…and I  was going to sell it to the Trepies for a whole load of gil. Besides, you  must’ve cheated.” She snapped.</p>
<p>“Did not.”</p>
<p>“Did too.”</p>
<p>“Did not.”</p>
<p>“Did too.”  Quisits suddenly leaned forwards and cut her off with a kiss. Their lips barely  even touched before she stood up and ran out the door, leaving it swinging as  Xu sat there, stunned.</p>
