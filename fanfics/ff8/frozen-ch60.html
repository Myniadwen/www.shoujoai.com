Laguna had sent a special shuttle to pick everyone up and within the 
hour they were landing outside the Sorceress Memorial just beyond 
Eshtar&#146;s city limits. Laguna, Kiros, Ward and Ellone were waiting to 
meet them. The night air had a chill to it that seemed to fit the 
melancholy mood of everyone present. Laguna stepped forward to shake 
Squall and Cid&#146;s hands.

&quot;Glad to see all of you again, it&#146;s a shame it&#146;s on such unpleasant 
terms.&quot;

&quot;Same here, I&#146;m sorry about all of this.&quot; Cid said apologetically.

&quot;Don&#146;t be, from what you&#146;ve told me, I should be thanking all of you.&quot; 
Laguna smiled brightly then grew somber.

&quot;Especially you sir.&quot; He said stepping towards Seifer.

Seifer shrugged. &quot;Hell I didn&#146;t have anything better to do.

Squall elbowed him and frowned, he didn&#146;t like how casual Seifer was 
being.

&quot;Brave man.&quot; Laguna nodded.

&quot;Are we sure this will work?&quot; Selphie asked curiously, raising her hand.

&quot;The process is infallible, Griever will be contained.&quot; Kiros spoke up.

&quot;Just make sure no one wakes me up early, I&#146;m grumpy without my beauty 
sleep.&quot; Seifer joked but no one laughed. Edea coughed lightly and 
touched Cid&#146;s arm.

&quot;Let us go.&quot; She said softly.

&quot;Yes, yes we&#146;re just making this harder.&quot; He sighed.

&quot;Right, this way please.&quot; Laguna bowed courteously.

Zell hurried to Seifer&#146;s side and kept pace with him.

&quot;Dude, aren&#146;t you like terrified?&quot; He whispered.

&quot;Not at all. Keep and eye on me chicken wuss, I&#146;ll show you how to go 
out like a man.&quot; Seifer said gruffly as they strode up the stairs and 
into the Memorial. Zell back a step and leaned over to Selphie.

&quot;He&#146;s made of stone.&quot; He said truly impressed by Seifer&#146;s resolve.

&quot;He&#146;s terrified.&quot; Selphie said quietly.

&quot;I can&#146;t believe he&#146;s actually doing this. I mean this sucks, first Aeka 
and now.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t want to talk about it.&quot; Selphie said bluntly, not once looking 
at him.

Zell paused and frowned.

&quot;Am I the only one here that thinks this may be wrong?&quot; Zell said 
quietly, more to himself than anyone in particular.

&quot;It is wrong, now come on.&quot; Irvine whispered as he walked past.

Up ahead of the procession Ellone walked beside Squall and Rinoa with a 
look of worry.

&quot;You look awful.&quot; Ellone said timidly to Squall.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Squall frowned.

&quot;I didn&#146;t mean anything by that. I&#146;m just worried about you.&quot; She 
frowned.

&quot;I know, it&#146;s just that. We&#146;ve had a bad last few days.&quot; Squall said, 
his expression softening slightly.

&quot;Want to talk about it?&quot; She asked, touching his shoulder lightly.

&quot;Not really. How&#146;s Laguna doing?&quot; He said, changing the subject.

&quot;He&#146;s fine. You know he wishes you&#146;d call now and again. He wants to get 
to know you better. I mean, you..&quot; Ellone began but Squall looked at her 
and shook his head.

&quot;Not now.&quot; He said briskly.

&quot;You brought it up. I just wish you&#146;d call too, I never get to hear from 
or see any of you anymore. It&#146;s awfully lonely out here.&quot;

&quot;Why don&#146;t you come to Balamb?&quot; Rinoa asked thoughtfully.

&quot;I&#146;ve thought about it, but I don&#146;t want to become a SEED.&quot; Ellone 
frowned.

&quot;It is a normal school too.&quot; Squall noted absently as they entered into 
an immense domed room. The room was filled with huge hoses that where 
covered in frost and gases vented from pressure valves in the ceiling. 
In the center of the room sat a circular chamber surrounded by various 
computer towers and other unrecognizable equipment.

The chamber was separated from the rest of the room by thick glass. 
Inside the chamber stood a large structure that resembled a disk 
standing on end. An operating table of sorts was at its heart and the 
entire affair was covered in circuitry. Complete with a vast array of 
mechanical clamps and hoses the device looked like some alien torture 
device. Scientists in white coats scurried about like frenzied ants.

&quot;Your not putting him in that?&quot; Rinoa balked.

&quot;Oh yes.&quot; A peculiar little man in a coat said in a jolly tone.

&quot;Doctor Odine.&quot; Cid sighed.

&quot;Yes, yes.&quot; The eccentric doctor nodded.

&quot;Who&#146;s this nut?&quot; Seifer snorted.

&quot;Long story.&quot; Kiros said as Laguna started to speak.

&quot;Right.&quot; Seifer said, folding his arms.

&quot;He knows the equipment better than anyone else.&quot; Kiros went on to 
explain.

&quot;Expert, wonderful. I am all these things.&quot; The good doctor said with a 
proud smile. &quot;You&#146;re the test subject?&quot; He said hopefully as he poked 
Seifer with a crooked finger.

&quot;Get this guy away from me.&quot; Seifer growled.

&quot;Doctor, how good to see you again.&quot; Rinoa said hollowly as she took the 
Doctor by the arm and pulled him away.

Quistis leaned heavily against a far wall, well away from the 
proceedings. Fujin walked slowly over to regard her thoughtfully.

&quot;HOW FEELING?&quot; She asked finally.

&quot;I just want this to be over with.&quot; Quistis said with a heavy sigh.

&quot;ME TOO.&quot;

&quot;I should hate him.&quot; Quistis said with a halfhearted scowl. &quot;But I don&#146;t 
have it in me anymore, all I see is someone I grew up with about to toss 
his life away. Another life lost, it&#146;s a shame, even if it is his.&quot; 
Quistis sighed.

&quot;HE WANTS.&quot; Fujin said, looking over at Seifer who was being checked 
over by various scientists.

&quot;I wonder if he&#146;ll be aware once he&#146;s in stasis?&quot; Quistis asked 
morbidly.

&quot;UNKNOWN.&quot;

&quot;I wish I could be like you.&quot; Quistis sighed and sat down on the floor. 
Fujin kneeled by her side.

&quot;NEGATIVE&quot; She said simply

&quot;But you&#146;ve got it under control. After everything we&#146;ve been through, 
you just keep going and I&#146;m going to pieces.&quot;

&quot;KNOW ME BETTER THAN THAT.&quot; Fujin smiled faintly.

&quot;I know, you just show if differently. I&#146;m sorry.&quot; Quistis smiled, 
touching her hand gently. Looking up they saw Squall and the others were 
intent on making sure things were done right. Cid and Edea stood alone 
talking to each other quietly.

&quot;He&#146;s taking this pretty hard.&quot; Quistis nodded towards the headmaster.

Fujin nodded but kept silent.

&quot;How are you holding Quisty.&quot; Rinoa said to the weary instructor.

&quot;Why does everyone keep asking me that.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;SHE WILL BE OKAY.&quot; Fujin interjected. Rinoa looked worried a moment 
then stepped towards Fujin who eyed her warily.

&quot;I want to talk to you.&quot; Rinoa whispered.

Fujin looked to Quistis curiously then back to Rinoa.

&quot;WHY?&quot;

&quot;Come on.&quot; Rinoa said, gesturing to a more out of the way area of the 
lab.

Grudgingly Fujin followed and folded her arms as they stopped to regard 
each other.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin started off.

&quot;It&#146;s about Seifer, I think you should say something to him.&quot; Rinoa 
whispered. Fujin scoffed and pushed past her, intent on going back to 
Quistis&#146;s side.

&quot;He&#146;s as good as dead, you have to know that. I know you have no reason 
to care for him anymore. I mean, yes he hurt you, but he hurt us all. 
I&#146;m willing to forgive him, we can&#146;t let him go thinking no one cares.&quot;

&quot;FINE YOU GO.&quot; Fujin said mildly.

&quot;Your heartless.&quot; Rinoa frowned.

&quot;WHAT DO YOU WANT?&quot; Fujin whispered harshly.

&quot;Anything, anything to let him know he&#146;ll be remembered. He&#146;s doing this 
for us.&quot;

&quot;DOING FOR HIMSELF.&quot; Fujin said sourly, pointing to Seifer who was being 
studied by a score of scientists.

&quot;Why are you even here then. He loves you and seeing you here and 
knowing you hate him is just going to make it worse on him.&quot;

&quot;&quot;TOUGH.&quot; Fujin shrugged.

&quot;Your horrible.&quot;

Fujin sighed and continued past her and back to Quistis who looked up 
curiously.

&quot;What did she want.&quot;

&quot;NOTHING.&quot; Fujin frowned as she watched the proceedings stoically.

&quot;She wants you to say something to him.&quot; Quistis said quietly. Fujin 
didn&#146;t look at her but nodded.

&quot;Are you?&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin said with chilling finality.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry.&quot; Quistis said with a hint of sadness.

&quot;FOR WHAT.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t know.&quot; Quistis sighed and rested her head back against the 
wall. &quot;I don&#146;t know anything, just ignore me.&quot;

Doctor Odine began shepherding everyone away from the stasis chamber 
with a fevered determination.

&quot;Time is near, back, back.&quot; He said eagerly.

&quot;Damn.&quot; Squall muttered under his breath and looked to Seifer 
imploringly. He just couldn&#146;t get over this, it wasn&#146;t right but he was 
helpless to stop it. Griever needed to be contained and Seifer had made 
his choice.

Selphie and Irvine went to stand by Rinoa who was looking on with sad 
eyes.

&quot;He&#146;s really doing this.&quot; She whispered.

Irvine prodded her forward slightly.

&quot;Go on, say your good-byes.&quot; He said, nodding towards Seifer.

Rinoa exhaled weakly and looked at Selphie, who was oddly stone-faced 
about the whole affair, not that anyone could blame her.

&quot;Go on.&quot; The small woman said briskly, and Rinoa smiled softly before 
moving on. Only Squall stood with Seifer as she approached.

&quot;Hey there.&quot; She said faintly.

&quot;Hey yourself.&quot; Seifer chuckled, this time though the strain was evident 
in his voice. Squall patted Seifer on the shoulder and nodded before 
leaving the two of them to say their peace.

&quot;I can&#146;t believe you doing this.&quot; Rinoa said quietly, smoothing out his 
tussled hair.

&quot;I can&#146;t either.&quot; Seifer smiled thinly.

&quot;I&#146;ll remember you.&quot; She said softly.

&quot;That&#146;s what I&#146;m afraid of.&quot; He responded regretfully. &quot;It&#146;s best you 
all forget this and go on.&quot;

Rinoa bit her lip and stood on her toes to give him a gentle kiss then 
stepped away from him. With tears in her eyes she rushed to Squall and 
buried her head against his chest. Seifer smiled at the two then turned 
his attention to Fujin, who watched him with hawk like intensity. Doctor 
Odine tugged his sleeve timidly.

&quot;We must hurry.&quot; He whispered.

&quot;I know, one moment.&quot; Seifer said, then walked towards Fujin. Raising 
her chin defiantly she stiffed as he approached. To her surprise he 
walked past her and towards Quistis how was still sitting quietly 
against the far wall.

Kneeling by her side he leaned close to her and whispered in her ear.

&quot;Take care of her, give her what I couldn&#146;t.&quot; He said simply. Quistis 
looked at him awkwardly, her blue eyes wide in wonder.

&quot;See ya around.&quot; He said with a smile then stole a kiss while she was 
stunned. Rising to his feet he strode by Fujin who watched him in 
bewilderment.

&quot;INSANE.&quot; She called out to as he strode forward and into the waiting 
chamber.

&quot;Love you too!&quot; He chuckled to her as Doctor Odine bid him to rest back 
against the disk at the heart of the chamber. Cid walked in and regarded 
the youth. Looking to Edea with a frown a moment he turned his attention 
back to Seifer.

&quot;Brave lad, I&#146;m proud of you.&quot; He said with a growing cloud of sorrow on 
his face.

&quot;Yeah well I try. Lets cut the small talk shall we, and get this over 
with.&quot; Seifer snapped excitedly and closed his eyes. Cid nodded and he 
and the left and Edea entered.

&quot;Seifer.&quot; She said richly, touching his cheek. Seifer opened his eyes 
and frowned.

&quot;I can&#146;t hold him anymore Edea.&quot; Seifer whispered harshly.

&quot;I know child.&quot; She sighed. &quot;I&#146;m very proud of you. My brave Knight, my 
son.&quot; She smiled tenderly. &quot;You&#146;ve been so strong through all of this, 
it&#146;s time for you to let go of the burden you carry.&quot; She whispered then 
kissed him softly in the lips. Seifer&#146;s eyes widened in shock as she 
brought both hands up to grip either side of his head. A burst of energy 
exploded from them and Seifer shuttered as if being electrocuted.

&quot;What is she doing!&quot; Laguna shouted, shielding his eyes from the light.

&quot;Edea!&quot; Squall screamed and ran forward only be intercepted by Cid. 
&quot;What are you doing? Let go of me.&quot; He shouted as a wave of energy blew 
everyone to the floor. Ellone sat up and looked on in horror.

&quot;Something terrible is happening!&quot; She shouted as Seifer collapsed 
forward into Edea&#146;s arms. Gently she laid him down and looked up to see 
everyone running towards her. Her face was serene but quickly it twisted 
into a snarl as she opened her mouth and a sound akin to a roar issued 
forth, shaking the entire building.

&quot;Griever!&quot; He shouted, motioning everyone to step back.

Laguna pulled Ellone behind him as Kiro&#146;s and Ward took up a defensive 
position.

&quot;Aw no.&quot; Zell cried out in dismay and holding his head in disbelief. 
Quistis scrambled to her feet and looked on in horror as Edea lifted 
Seifer off the ground with one hand. He groaned, and opened his eyes.

&quot;What?&quot; He mumbled half, conscious. Dr. Odine and the other scientists 
fled from building as she tossed Seifer harshly into Squall. The two men 
fell into a tangled heap at Cid&#146;s feet.

&quot;Edea!&quot; The headmaster shouted as warning klaxons began to sound.

Irvine drew his gun and paused, his hands shaking. Irvine and Selphie 
looked on in confusion, neither sure as to what to do. Fujin looked to 
Quistis for suggestions but found none. Rinoa knelt to help Squall and 
Seifer to their feet. Edea&#146;s eyes flashed crimson and she moved forward 
threateningly.

&quot;Edea.&quot; Cid called again this time calmer as he crept closer.

&quot;Sir, get away!&quot; Irvine shouted drawing his rifle.

Selphie saw Ward and Kiros shoving Laguna and Ellone out the exit and 
was thankful when they got clear.

&quot;Get out of here.&quot; Irvine said to her as he took aim at Edea.

&quot;Yeah right.&quot; Selphie scoffed.

&quot;Irvine, you can&#146;t just shoot her!&quot; Quistis shouted.

&quot;We have to do something.&quot; He said grimly, his hands shaking.

Fujin moved forward in preparation of a fight, she had no weapon but she 
meant to try her best.

&quot;Betrayal!&quot; Edea growled, looking at Seifer in disgust. She gestured at 
him with an outstretched hand and an invisible force wrenched Seifer off 
the ground.

&quot;Betrayer!&quot; She hisses and clenched her hand into a fist. Seifer choked 
and thrashed in the air as his lungs began to be crushed.

&quot;Edea.&quot; Cid beckoned soothingly and reached out to her. He stood closer 
now, nearly within arms reach. Squall drew his gunblade and prepared to 
lunge. Cid cut him a stern glance and made him pause. Stepping forward 
one last time Cid gently reached out to touch Edea&#146;s outstretched hand.

&quot;Let him go, this is not what you wanted, you have to fight it.&quot;

&quot;Kill you!&quot; She hissed shakily.

&quot;No, you won&#146;t.&quot; He smiled. &quot;Let&#146;s finish what we started.&quot;

&quot;Started?&quot; She growled, and her hand began to tremble. Seifer collapsed 
to the ground coughing violently.

&quot;Come back to us love.&quot; Cid whispered.

Edea lowered her arms and her eyes dimmed.

&quot;There you go.&quot; Cid smiled and pulled her into a tight embrace.

The silence in the room was deafening.

&quot;What is going on!&quot; Squall grunted warily, his weapon still drawn.

Edea sighed and Cid let her go.

&quot;I love you my wife.&quot; He said softly.

&quot;And I you my husband.&quot; Edea whispered back then focused her attention 
on her wards. &quot;Forgive me, my children.&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot; Irvine mumbled, lowering his rifle.

Seifer slowly got to his feet and looked about in bewilderment as Edea 
turned and rushed into the stasis chamber.

&quot;No!&quot; Squall shouted running towards her. Cid grabbed him once more and 
Squall slung him to the ground. &quot;Are you crazy she&#146;ll be killed!&quot; Squall 
roared.

&quot;She&#146;s dying already.&quot; Cid said firmly as he picked himself up. A 
collective gasp issued from the room and Selphie looked as though she 
was about to faint.

&quot;What?&quot; Rinoa asked in shock.

&quot;She&#146;s been dying ever since Ultimecia left her.&quot; Cid said with tears in 
eyes.

&quot;No.&quot; Squall murmured, dropping his gunblade.

&quot;Matron!&quot; Quistis screamed out in anguish and ran forward.

&quot;QUISTIS!&quot; Fujin shouted but wasn&#146;t close enough to stop her. Seifer was 
and he caught her around the waist and lifted her off the ground.

&quot;Let go!&quot; Quistis screamed in angrily, kicking and flailing in his arms.

&quot;Take her!&quot; Seifer roared pushing her towards Irvine.

He then turned and strode after the former Sorceress.

&quot;Edea!&quot; He shouted as he approached. With a slight wave of her hand Edea 
closed the door in his face.

&quot;You tricked me!&quot; Seifer shouted banging on the hardened glass.

Edea lowered her head and sighed before turning to face him, black blood 
was already beginning to dribble down the corners of her mouth.

&quot;I am sorry, but I was to weak to bring him here myself.&quot; She said 
softly, her slender fingers touching the glass.

&quot;I do this for you my son.&quot; She smiled gently.

&quot;You can&#146;t leave me like this, what&#146;s to become of me!&quot; Seifer screamed 
in despair clawing at the glass.

&quot;You must live.&quot; Edea coughed, her eyes flared crimson.

&quot;But you&#146;re the only one who understands.&quot; Seifer murmured with tears in 
his eyes. &quot;Without you, I&#146;ll be truly alone!&quot;

&quot;It will be hard, I know. But do your best with the second chance you&#146;ve 
been given. Please, you must live, I can leave peacefully knowing you 
are all safe.&quot; She whispered and collapsed onto one knee.

&quot;Edea.&quot; He pleaded feebly as she forced herself to stand and limped to 
the stasis disk. Cid could take no more and turned away. Quistis went to 
his side to comfort him as Edea rested her back against the disk and 
closed her eyes.

With a feeble gesture, she used the last of her magic to bring the 
machinery to life. The disk glowed and a halo of light filled the 
chamber as Griever&#146;s fury burned away the last spark of life from her. 
Edea Kramer&#146;s last thoughts where of her children, and of her beloved 
husband. With tears in her eyes she whispered Cid&#146;s name and died. With 
Edea gone, Griever began to regain control and to its horror, it 
realized it was trapped. It didn&#146;t even have time to shout its rage 
before being engulfed in a blinding light, and then, all was dark. </pre>
