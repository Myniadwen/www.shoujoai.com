<p align="center">Love,  Really</p>
<p>Xu fidgeted nervously.  She wasn’t sure what to do or say in his presence. Quistis was  right by her, holding her hand. Seer paced back and forth, shaking  his head.</p>
<p>“It would be nice if  you didn’t mention it to anyone.” Xu said meekly.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to,  it’s just a bit of a shock. I mean…here I was about to kiss you  and this <em>girl</em> runs in and steals that kiss from me.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing  wrong with that!” Xu defended.</p>
<p>“Well, shocking in  the least.” Seer sighed. He ran his hands through his hair and sat  down. “I’m sorry if I tried to take your girlfriend.” Xu hung  her head. In fact, it was probably the other way around. Quistis saw  the look on her face and gave her hand a gentle squeeze.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry you had  to find out this way.” The blond said apologetically.</p>
<p>“It’s fine…it’ll  just take some getting used to.”</p>
<p>“We’re trying to  keep it under wraps.” Xu interjected. “I mean…you’re the  second person to know and we want to keep the number as minimal as  possible.”</p>
<p>“Reputation?” Seer  asked.</p>
<p>“More like Quistis’s  career at stake.” Seer cocked an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“I thought laws  protected you from this kind of thing?” He asked.</p>
<p>“They do.” Xu  replied. “But we had this one teacher a few years ago, very nice  young man, well liked…until they found out he was gay. Suddenly all  sorts of things started to go wrong…students started to claim  molestation, a ‘discipline problem.’ Cid hated to do it, but he  had to fire him.”</p>
<p>“Ah, sabotage.”  Seer nodded. Quistis sighed.</p>
<p>“You, dear, need to  let me worry about that.” She said. Xu pouted and Quistis laughed,  kissing her on the check. Seer coughed to signal that he was still in  the room and still a little sore from the rejection.</p>
<p>“You know…you’ve  got to tell your friends one day or another. I mean, your friend  Irvine told me that we were engaged.” He laughed. “That guy…sure  knows how to fool someone.” Xu’s left eye twitched visibly and  she smiled crookedly.</p>
<p>“Really, Irvine you  say…?” Quistis realized what was going through Xu’s mind and  placed her hand on her shoulder to steady her.</p>
<p>“Easy does it, hun.”  She whispered. “Be good. Remember what happens when you’re good.”  Xu remembered back to the day after Quistis’s birthday and shivered  at the thought of something more. “It’s getting pretty late, that  old guy at the gate hates it when people come through at ridiculous  hours.” The two of them stood up.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to  walk you back?” Seer offered.</p>
<p>“No, Xu’ll protect  me, won’t you?” Quistis teased, scrunching up her nose and  sticking her tongue out. Xu returned the gesture and the two of them  said their goodbyes to Seer and walked out the door.</p>

The walk back to  Balamb Garden was a silent one for the first half. Xu felt so good  just walking with Quistis and she wanted to hold Quistis’s hand but  she was afraid.
<p>“Quis?” She  whispered.</p>
<p>“Yeah?” The  Instructor replied. Xu stopped walking. If she didn’t ask now, she  would never be sure, and she wanted to be sure, she wanted it to be  reality.</p>
<p>“Is it real this  time? I mean…no more doubts, no more anything? I don’t want to  sound selfish but I just want you so much that it hurts.” She  couldn’t stop tears from. Quistis walked over and hushed her,  holding her close.</p>
<p>“It’s real, I  promise, no more doubts.”</p>
<p>“What about <em>him</em>?”</p>
<p>“He’s not the same  person, Xu. And even if he does return to the Arik I knew, I’m not  the same person. I’ve changed, I’ve moved on. And right now, I  don’t want to lose you so just please believe me.” She smiled at  the brunette and kissed her on the mouth in the street, slowly and  affectionately. Xu broke apart, her face flushed and her pulse  escalating. Now or never.</p>
<p>“I want you.” She  hissed. Quistis jerked back a little and Xu winced. “I’m sorry. I  didn’t mean to say that. Well…I mean I did but…”</p>
<p>“It’s ok.”  Quistis replied, getting over the initial shock and blushing. “I  want you too.&quot; The two smiled nervously at each other, knowing where  they wanted this to go, but unsure of how to get there. The blonde  broke the silence first by grabbing Xu’s hand. “Come on.” She  said and the two of them ran back to Balamb Garden, ignoring the old  gate keeper’s raspy shouts at them for being late and setting a bad  example for younger students. Xu didn’t care who saw them but no  one did. The two of them rushed to Xu’s room, hearts beating until  it felt like they were going to burst. Xu fumbled with the key to her  room.</p>
<p>“Damn, just unlock!”  She hissed. It took a moment, a moment of eternity it seemed to  unlock the door and the two of them tripped over the welcome mat at  the door and both of them fell in a frenzy of kisses, even before  they hit the ground. The impact accidentally made Xu bit down a  little, causing Quistis’s lip to bleed.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry!” She  apologized but Quistis said nothing, pulling her in for another kiss  and Xu could taste the blood. The two of them got up and Quistis  pulled Xu’s tie off, throwing it onto the shoe rack. Xu attempted  to unzip Quistis’s top but only succeeded half way before she  zipped her own finger.</p>
<p>“DAMN!” She cursed  as the finger began to bleed. The two of them began to laugh.</p>
<p>“Look at us.” The  Instructor giggled. “We’re going to kill ourselves before we get  to bed.&quot; But the two didn’t seem to mind as Xu finished what she set  out to do.</p>
<p>“Black lace…Irvine?”  Xu commented with a sly smile.</p>
<p>“Just for you.”  Quistis replied, kissing her now bare shoulder. And when the two  finally made it to Xu’s bed, they toppled over onto it.</p>
<p>“As much as I like  it.” Xu said in between kisses, “It has to go.”</p>
<p>“Only if you take  off that hideous leopard prints…” Quistis wrinkled her nose in  mock disgust. Xu balked.</p>
<p>“It is not! That’s  it! You know what? I’m leaving.” She said, moving to get up.  Quistis grabbed the collar of her open shirt and pulled her back down  on top of her.</p>
<p>“Shut up and kiss  me.”</p>
<p>Xu had never known  love. All her life, except for Becca, she had never been loved and  she had never loved as she should have. This new experience was  something that frightened her. She and Quistis were finally getting  to each other, not just physically but spiritually. Sex with Quistis  was a spiritual act for Xu, something that one could not do without  his/her complete soul. It was more than just stripping down the cloth  barriers that separated them, it was also stripping down the walls  both of them had put up to protect themselves. For the first time in  a long time, Quistis and Xu lay themselves bare to each other, the  person they cared about the most. When Quistis’s hands found Xu,  memorized every patch of skin on her body and then dipped down past  her waistline to where Xu had never been touched before, Xu closed  her eyes and buried her face deep into Quistis’s collarbone and bit  down on her lip.</p>
<p>“You ok?” Quistis  breathed. Xu nodded until her body seized up and she cried out a  little in shock, unaccustomed to such a feeling, such bliss. Quistis  used her other hand to stroke Xu’s hair softly, planting kisses on  her head. “I love you.” Xu nodded again, her entire body still  numb and tingling. Xu took a deep breath and turned to face her.</p>
<p>“My turn…” she  said mischievously.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Night seemed to go by  quickly for the two. Exhausted, both of them drifted into sleep, well  past the morning. Their clothes lay scattered all around the room  haphazardly, proof of just how frantic they were to get to bed. But  their absence did not go unnoticed, at least not Quistis’s.</p>
<p>“Where is she? She’s  not in her room.” Selphie sighed, biting her fingernail. Rinoa  slapped her hand.</p>
<p>“Stop that! That’s  a bad habit!”</p>
<p>“I can’t help it.”  Selphie whined. “Where’s Quistis?”</p>
<p>“I know where she  might be.” Irvine said with a grin. “Have you checked Arik’s  place?” Selphie stomped on Irvine’s foot.</p>
<p>“You pervert!” And  then she stopped. “But maybe…” It was at this moment that Ayane  and Zell walked in. Zell immediately bustled off to the cafeteria  line for his daily hour of waiting for hotdogs. Ayane sat down.</p>
<p>“Grab me something!”  She shouted to him and turned to everyone. “You guys look worried,  what’s up?”</p>
<p>“Quistis isn’t in  her room and no one’s seen her since last night. Usually, she meets  us here for breakfast and it’s not like Quistis to break a  schedule.” Selphie explained. Ayane thought for a moment. Quistis  wasn’t in her room and last night, she was with Arik. But…</p>
<p>“XU!” She said  aloud. Everyone stopped and stared at her and her face went pale. <em>Oh  shit, think of something…come on…</em></p>
<p>“Xu?” Rinoa asked  curiously, looking behind her. “She’s not here…what?”</p>
<p>“Uh…Xu might know  where Quistis is! You know, the two of them are close…” She  stopped again. <em>Just give it away, why don’t you, Aya? Just go  ahead and say it, you’re practically there.</em></p>
<p>“Yeah, maybe.”  Selphie said. “I’ll go ask her right now. I haven’t seen her so  maybe she’s in her room signing papers or something.”</p>
<p>“NO!”  Aya stood up and blocked her way. “You…uh…go check Quistis’s  room one more time. I’ll go to Xu. Besides, she’s real cranky  when you disturb her.”</p>
<p>“Ewww, you’re  right. One time, I woke her up and she practically took my head off…”</p>
<p>“Great! We’ll meet  back here.” Aya ran as fast as she could towards the dorms. When  she got to Xu’s room, she took a deep breath and knocked.</p>
<p>Inside, Xu and Quistis  were still dozing when Aya’s knock woke them up. They both sat up  and looked around.</p>
<p>“What? What’s  going on…?” Quistis asked sleepily. Xu was the first to realize.</p>
<p>“CRAP! Someone’s  at the door!” She stood up and slipped on a shirt and some shorts.  Quistis buried herself under the covers and hid, laughing. “There’s  nothing funny about this!”</p>
<p>“Sorry, sorry…”  Quistis apologized. Xu walked cautiously over to the door and gently  slid it open.</p>
<p>“Hi!” Aya said  cheerfully. Xu sighed in relief.</p>
<p>“Thank goodness it’s  just you.”<br />
  “Why? Is Quistis in there with you?” Aya said  grinning evilly. Xu blushed.</p>
<p>“Hey now! That’s a  pri…”</p>
<p>“HI!” Quistis  shouted from the bedroom. Aya giggled and Xu slapped her forehead.  Quistis ran up, a blanket wrapped around her body and trailing behind  her. Her strawberry blond hair was a mess and she couldn’t stop  giggling.</p>
<p>“I take it you two  made up?” Aya asked with a smile. Quistis kissed Xu’s cheek.  “I’ll take that as a yes. It’s so great that you two are back  together!”</p>
<p>“I think she’s  more trouble than she’s worth.” Xu muttered, rolling her eyes.  Quistis balked and frowned.</p>
<p>“So…what about  Arik?” Aya asked.</p>
<p>“We told him the  truth and he’s fine. A little shocked, yes, but fine.” Quistis  replied. Aya nodded and then remembered.</p>
<p>“Hey, uh, Selphie  and the others are going into a fit looking for you. I think you two  should get dressed because they’re bound to visit this place next.”  She warned. The two lovers looked at each other and sighed.</p>
<p>“I guess you’re  right. Oh well, there’s always this evening.” Quistis replied  with a smirk. Aya and Xu blushed at the same time.</p>
<p>“We’ll be right  out.” Xu said, shutting the door. Aya could not stop herself from  smiling. It seemed like everything would be alright after all.</p>
