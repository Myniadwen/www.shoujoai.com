Quistis felt a heartfelt pang of pride as her former students reacted to 
the insanity that assaulted them in a cool and professional manner. In 
an act of desperation to keep the floor from swallowing anyone else she 
closed her eyes and called forth Shiva, the guardian force of ice and 
winter. All the while the others tried desperately to keep the flailing 
mix of tendrils and mouths at bay. The blue hued guardian arrived with 
an explosion of icy shards and looked about in bewilderment.

&quot;Freeze the floor!&quot; Quistis shouted over the clang of combat. Shiva 
nodded and aimed her outstretched hands at the floor. An icy wind howled 
loudly and the temperature dropped drastically the cramped quarters. The 
heavy moisture in the air made it snow briefly as patch of glacier blue 
ice spread out under the feet of all those present. Shiva did her best 
not to freeze anyone to the floor, but as it was everyone had to 
maneuver and hop about to keep their feet free of the encroaching ice. 
The nightmares assaulting them in the hall slowed and groaned in 
tortured agony before falling limp as the air about them dropped to 
below freezing. Everyone paused and looked around in wonder. No one had 
expected the attack to render everything inert so quickly.

&quot;Yes!&quot; Nei shouted in victory. Shiva examined her handiwork curiously a 
moment then vanished.

&quot;Come on lets get the wounded out of here while we can.&quot; Quistis 
ordered. The prevailing heat of the core was quickly thawing the icy 
coated hallway and several monstrous appendages began to twitch anew.

**********************

Irvine Kinneas knew he was going to die. He knew it deep in his gut as 
he struggled in vain to pull free of the thing that had engulfed his 
skull. He thrashed around the room clawing and staggering until he felt 
to his knees, dizzy from lack of oxygen. He had an idea, insane, but 
reasonable, or perhaps it only seemed so because he was suffocating. 
Either way it seemed suicidal at best, but he knew he had little time 
before the thing attacking him finished its horrible work.

&quot;Going to die anyway.&quot; He mused inwardly and brought both hands up to 
either side of his head. It struck him oddly funny how calm he was as he 
began to channel the spell. He felt a pressure building in his ears and 
could hear the dull roar from the spell&#146;s formation.

**********************

&quot;So when can we expect the others to arrive?&quot; Ellone asked as she went 
about the palace garden hanging colored lanterns. Rinoa, who followed 
and held the ladder at each stop shrugged half-heartedly.

&quot;I dunno.&quot;

&quot;Well hopefully we have time to finish this stuff. By the way, how&#146;s 
everyone holding up. I mean about Edea and everything.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; Rinoa responded absently.

&quot;How are you doing?&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot;

&quot;You don&#146;t sound it.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Rinoa blinked looking up at her as if she&#146;d just noticed she&#146;d 
been talking.

&quot;You need to talk to him.&quot;

&quot;He can come to me.&quot; Rinoa grumbled.

&quot;She&#146;s right.&quot; Nicole added as she walked by, having overheard the 
exchange.

&quot;I&#146;ve made up my mind, time to see if he&#146;s serious.&quot;

&quot;Of course he&#146;s serious.&quot; Ellone frowned. &quot;After what you two have been 
through how could you even question it?&quot;

&quot;Ellone is right, you two came to far to fall apart over something silly 
like this.&quot; Nicole chimed in, walking back to join the conversation.

&quot;Silly, this is serious!&quot; Rinoa pouted.

&quot;It was a mistake, careless and stupid yes but he hardly deserves you 
acting like this.&quot; Ellone said firmly.

&quot;He did ask you to marry him, I&#146;d thought you&#146;d be excited.&quot;

&quot;He only did that because he goofed up and felt pressured.&quot; Rinoa 
snapped angrily.

&quot;Granted the timing sucked but how do you know he wasn&#146;t serious?&quot; 
Nicole smiled hopefully. Rinoa huffed and folded her arms.

&quot;Hold the ladder!&quot; Ellone yelped as it started to teeter. Rinoa jumped 
slightly and to back possession of it.

&quot;I don&#146;t buy it, he came out of left field with it. That and we&#146;ve been 
having trouble lately. I&#146;m sure marrying me was the last thing on his 
mind.&quot;

&quot;Everyone has trouble girl, that&#146;s just part of a relationship.&quot; Nicole 
pointed out. &quot;Heck, Zell washed my whites with a pair of black pants the 
other day. I could have killed him.&quot;

Rinoa looked at her hollowly.

&quot;Okay, silly example.&quot; Nicole blushed. &quot;But I&#146;m just trying to say, 
things happen sometimes.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t care, he&#146;s being a jerk.&quot;

&quot;Um, he&#146;s been like that since you met him.&quot; Ellone said awkwardly. 
&quot;Never seemed to trouble you until recently.&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Rinoa started then frowned.

&quot;She has a point.&quot; Nicole nodded.

&quot;He&#146;s just so frustrating!&quot;

&quot;Men usually are.&quot; Nicole mused.

&quot;Yup.&quot; Ellone added with a grin.

&quot;I can&#146;t believe he embarrassed me like that.&quot;

&quot;Look at it this way.&quot; Nicole smiled. &quot;When has Squall ever said 
something he didn&#146;t mean.&quot;

&quot;He hardly says anything!&quot; Rinoa snapped in exasperation.

&quot;But when he does.&quot; Nicole prodded.

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Rinoa sighed in defeat. If anything, Squall was honest, 
sometimes brutally.

&quot;Then why the long face.&quot; Ellone beamed.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Rinoa blinked.

&quot;Duh!&quot; Nicole chuckled, smacking her lightly in the back of the head.

&quot;He asked you to marry him silly!&quot; Ellone giggled.

&quot;I know that.&quot; Rinoa said quietly.

&quot;What are you going to say?&quot; Nicole started excitedly then noticed 
Rinoa&#146;s still gloomy demeanor then frowned. &quot;You&#146;re still upset...?&quot; 
Nicole wondered.

&quot;I&#146;m not ready to forgive him yet...&quot;

&quot;Then don&#146;t, it was an awfully bubble headed thing to do.&quot; Ellone said 
as she moved on to hang more lanterns. &quot;Just don&#146;t wait to long, you 
said you two were having some problems. Better to do something to fix em 
sooner than later, holding stuff in makes it fester.&quot;

&quot;Yup, you need to go find him and let him have it, I mean yell, scream 
whatever, just get it out in the open instead of stewing about it.&quot; 
Nicole grinned. &quot;Guys are goofy, they won&#146;t know what&#146;s eating you 
unless you tell them.&quot;

&quot;So you say I shouldn&#146;t wait for him to come to me then.&quot; Rinoa asked, 
feeling torn.

&quot;Guys like you to chase em, he&#146;ll see you come to him and he&#146;ll feel 
better, that&#146;s when you lay down what&#146;s on you&#146;re mind.&quot; Nicole grinned.

&quot;Just don&#146;t be too bitchy, that will just make it worse. Just let him 
know that you want to be sure he&#146;s sincere and that you&#146;re upset about 
how he&#146;s been treating you.&quot; Ellone added sagely.

&quot;I suppose I could try.&quot; Rinoa smiled sadly. &quot;I mean he has put up with 
a lot from me, it&#146;s only fair that I return the favor.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s true too.&quot; Nicole grinned. &quot;What you made him do at Quistis&#146; 
birthday party was fiendish.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Ellone asked curiously.

Rinoa laughed. &quot;Long story. But that was surprising, I didn&#146;t think he&#146;d 
do it. He also put up my arguing with Fujin.&quot;

&quot;Arguing, that what you call being knocked out?&quot; Nicole grinned.

&quot;That&#146;s not funny.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m missing something aren&#146;t I?&quot; Ellone grinned.

********************************

Nida was not one to hide his emotions and he let his feels be known by 
letting out a blood-curling scream. However, it was one more of anger 
and revulsion than of fear. He heard the elevator door slam shut behind 
him and had no expectation to survive long enough to open them. Acting 
in the only manner he thought available, he charged the horde of 
monstrosities that had been the bridge crew. It had the desired effect; 
the monsters were taken aback by the attack and paused slightly. Nida 
took the split second opening and barreled through them. The towering 
mass of flesh and cables pulsed as numerous computer monitors that&#146;d 
been incorporated into the mass showed vaguely, humanoid faces twisted 
into rage.

Staying well out of reach of the hulking behemoth, Nida hopped over 
terminals and chairs in a frantic mad dash across the bridge.

&quot;Die!&quot; A voice gurgled, from somewhere deep, yet seemingly everywhere at 
the same time. One of the former bridge crew sprouted sickly insect 
wings and leaped at him as he was in mid jump over a bank of computers. 
While Nida didn&#146;t fancy himself much of a fighter, he was still a SEED 
and could hold his own, even if he was a bit rusty. It was enough to 
save him and he intercepted the thing in mid air and landed hard on his 
back. Using their momentum, he rolled backwards and kicked the thing 
with both feet. The creature screeched and flailed as it tried to right 
itself in the air. It smashed against one of bay windows surrounding the 
bridge and cracked it.

Opportunities were growing few and Nida knew he was running out of time. 
A spell of some sort exploded behind him as he got up, blowing him 
forward only to rebound off the same glass the beast had hit, cracking 
it further.

The sounds of the of former bridge crew rushing towards him made him 
gather his wits quickly and he made a hasty if not foolhardy decision. 
Grabbing a chair he and threw it at the glass with all his might. As 
expected, the glass shattered and he jumped through the opening.

The folly of his drastic exit soon made it self evident as he found 
himself sliding down the deeply slopped dome that made up the bridge&#146;s 
exterior. While preferable to a straight fall to his death or whatever 
the thing on the bridge had planned, he didn&#146;t entertain any notions of 
easily surviving the ride he was on now. Smooth as glass and with few 
things to hold onto, he knew he&#146;d soon reach the edge of the dome and 
then fly off into the spinning rings that rotated under the Garden.

The energy would probably cook him before he hit, he mused as he rolled 
over on his stomach to claw feebly at anything he could grab hold too. 
Raking his neatly manicured fingernails over the metal surface, he 
prayed he&#146;d snag a seam or something similar in the metal skin. He found 
what was looking for as his nails caught the lip of a small panel and 
were promptly ripped out. He yowled in pain but the yell quickly turned 
to one of fear as he abruptly found himself hurtling through open air.

Spiraling through the air, his mind tried in vain to think of anything 
to save him. He even considered flapping his arms in hopes of flight; at 
this point, nothing seemed too ridiculous to try. His journey ended 
abruptly as he slammed into a thin but sturdy spine belonging to one of 
Balamb&#146;s many sensor and radio arrays. He groaned, and his breath 
rattled in his chest, broken ribs he reasoned, then slid off his 
momentary perch, stunned. Another burst of adrenaline snapped him back 
to full awareness and he clawed madly to catch himself. Looking up 
wearily he realized he was lucky not to haven fallen far, but he was 
still in trouble. He had no clue how he was going to get back and knew 
that no one could find him if he stayed put. Crawling along the sensor 
spire, he found a nook in the base of the hull and wedged himself in it 
to rest.

***************************

An explosion of fire erupted around Irvine&#146;s skull. He screamed and fell 
backwards from the blast, yet he heard no sound, perhaps it was because 
he no longer had ears, the blast having burned them down to the bone. Or 
perhaps it was because he no longer had enough of his face to work his 
jaw or the melted slab that had been his tongue. Thrashing around in 
what he knew were death throes, he struggled to think past the white hot 
pain that assaulted his senses, his eyes were gone, melted out of their 
sockets. He clutched his ruined face, horrible, inhuman, bone, blood, 
and madness.

&quot;Choking!&quot;

&quot;Focus.&quot;

&quot;The pain&quot;

&quot;Focus.&quot;

&quot;Dying&quot;

&quot;Focus!&quot;

&quot;Selphie...&quot;

His hands trembled as the last vestiges of consciousness, indeed life 
itself, began to fade. Zeroing in on her memory, her used her to wash 
away the pain long enough for him to focus and his hands began to glow.

**********************

The journey from the core was thankfully more or less uneventful save 
for ominous noises. Fujin was quick to seal the entrance but knew it 
would not stop whatever evil had awakened. The youth that lost his arms 
was being tended to. Everyone moved quickly with healing and 
regeneration magic&#146;s, lest his loss be permanent. The magic flowed and 
his limbs reformed, albeit pale and withered, it would be sometime 
before he even had a hope of using them again.

&quot;QUISTIS?&quot; Fujin asked, hoping for some answer to what happened.

&quot;I don&#146;t know...&quot; Quistis replied helplessly. &quot;It&#146;s nothing close to 
what I&#146;ve seen before, it had control of the very walls...&quot;

&quot;What if it spreads?&quot; Nei wondered aloud. Quistis looked at the girl 
grimly, one of her best students. &quot;We&#146;ll think of something, first we 
need to regroup and get some help down here. I think this may be bigger 
than we realize.&quot;

&quot;IRVINE?&quot; Fujin asked.

&quot;I don&#146;t know, he said he was meeting us down here as soon as he 
gathered a group.&quot; Quistis answered then spoke into her headset. 
&quot;Irvine?&quot; No answer was forthcoming and that worried her, there should 
be no interference now that they left the core.

&quot;Selphie?&quot; She tried again.

&quot;What&#146;s up?&quot; Selphie beamed back.

&quot;Where&#146;s Irvine?&quot;

&quot;Dunno, last time I seen him he was talking to Nida. It&#146;s a mess up here 
Quisty, the students are getting worried and the powers still out.&quot;

&quot;Get everyone to the cafeteria, something&#146;s going on.&quot;

&quot;Huh why?&quot;

&quot;No time to go into details but something is going on in the core, I&#146;m 
not sure what it is but it&#146;s defiantly hostile.

&quot;Understood.&quot;

&quot;If you find Irvine, tell him to stay put, we&#146;re coming back up.&quot;

&quot;Okies.&quot; Selphie frowned, as she started to worry. Quickly, she turned 
and started getting everyone&#146;s attention. She was startled when Irvine 
staggered out of one of the nearby apartments. He seemed well enough but 
was completely and utterly bald, even his eyebrows where gone. His coat 
was singed and tattered and he looked slightly dazed.

&quot;Where the hells your hair!?&quot; Selphie shouted in shock and wonder.

Irvine rubbed his gleaming scalp sheepishly then hugged her tight.

&quot;Love you...&quot; He said with heartfelt glee.

&quot;What the, where have you been?&quot; She asked him again, seriously wanting 
answers.

&quot;It&#146;s okay.&quot; He smiled, eyes dancing.

&quot;You look ridiculous.&quot; She said quietly, faking a grin. Something had 
happened, something bad, but he obviously didn&#146;t want to talk about it.

&quot;It&#146;ll grow back.&quot; He laughed, long and loud, almost to the point of 
being frightening.

&quot;You&#146;re freaking me out babe.&quot; She responded said gravely, but decided 
it could wait. Several students were staring and pointing at him. He 
didn&#146;t care; he was too thrilled at being alive.

&quot;We need to get everyone out of here, something&#146;s going on.&quot; He finally 
said sternly, his mind getting back to business. &quot;I found two students, 
they&#146;re dead... Something&#146;s gotten into the walls.&quot; He added 
cryptically.

&quot;Damn... Quistis said she ran into trouble too.&quot; She sighed heavily. 
&quot;She wanted me to round everyone up and take them to the cafeteria. She 
also wants you to wait for her, they&#146;re coming back up.&quot;

&quot;Best not keep her waiting then, lets hurry up and finish rounding up 
the youngsters.&quot;

******************************

&quot;HEAR NOISES...&quot; Fujin mumbled as they made their way through the 
darkened halls. Just hours earlier, these same halls were home, 
completely non threatening. But now, in the darkness, everything seemed 
malevolent, the shadows crawled and even the very walls seemed to breath 
with alien life.

&quot;I know...&quot; Quistis said quietly, her eyes darting about as she watched 
for any sign of movement. The very air was alive with hushed, alien 
whispers.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry.&quot; Nei said quietly as she moved up beside them.

&quot;Huh for what?&quot; Quistis asked, looking at the junior SEED.

&quot;The others.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Quistis asked curiously.

&quot;Some of the other students, they&#146;ve been treating you funny. You know, 
ever since...&quot; She mumbled, tossing a glance at Fujin.

Quistis was taken aback and shook her head.

&quot;Now, you come to me with this.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, I&#146;m just nervous...&quot; The young woman frowned.

&quot;Me too, and thanks.&quot; Quistis grinned.

Fujin just shook her head as they neared the elevator.

Emergency power was still running it, but no one had any real desire to 
test his or her luck. Whatever could make the very walls come alive 
could easily turn the elevator into a deathtrap. Moving through a side 
door, they rushed up the stairwells and into Balamb&#146;s massive lobby. 
They could hear excited talking and children crying coming from the 
cafeteria.

&quot;Good they made it.&quot; Quistis sighed in relief as they rushed onward.

Irvine met them first and everyone skidded to a halt. Caught completely 
off guard Fujin&#146;s eye went wide at the sight of him.

&quot;HA!&quot; She blurted awkwardly, before regaining her composure.

&quot;Irvine?&quot; Quistis said quietly, almost afraid to ask.

&quot;We have problems... you&#146;re not going to like it.&quot; He said dryly.

&quot;I don&#146;t like it already. What happened?&quot; She asked as they strode into 
the cafeteria. Students and staff members crowded around her searching 
for answers.

&quot;Okay! Okay calm down, we&#146;re taking care of it, I just need to know 
what&#146;s happened.&quot; She yelled with gentle firmness.

&quot;We lost at least two, confirmed. Six others are missing, not including 
the maintenance staff.&quot;

&quot;No one&#146;s heard anything from the bridge either.&quot; Selphie pointed out 
quietly.

&quot;Nida...&quot; Quistis whispered, her brow furrowed with worry. &quot;We&#146;ve not 
landed either.&quot;

&quot;What did you guys find out.&quot; Selphie asked, eager for any news.

&quot;Something is in the core...&quot; Quistis started.

&quot;Any idea what it is?&quot; Irvine asked.

&quot;No.&quot; Quistis answered with brutal honesty. &quot;It&#146;s hard to explain. We 
only caught a glimpse of something then the walls came to life and 
attacked us.&quot;

&quot;Telekinesis?&quot; One of the teaching staff asked, overhearing the 
conversation.

&quot;No, it was alive, the metal, the grating, all of it moved like it was 
flesh.&quot; Nei explained anxiously.

&quot;We need to do something quick.&quot; Selphie frowned.

&quot;Well Quisty, it&#146;s you&#146;re call, what do we say?&quot; Irvine smiled 
sympathetically.

&quot;I&#146;m not loosing anyone else...&quot; She answered firmly then stood on a 
chair to get everyone&#146;s attention. Everyone started questioning her at 
once and she promptly bid them to quiet down.

&quot;Listen to me!&quot; She said in a loud authoritative tone. &quot;As you know, 
we&#146;ve a situation in the core. While I have no proper way to gauge the 
severity of the problem, I am confidant that the risk is enough to 
warrant a total and complete evacuation of Balamb Garden, active 
immediately.&quot;

&quot;Whoa!&quot; Irvine shouted in surprise and everyone started yelling.

&quot;You are to proceed immediately the escape pods, you are not to stop to 
retrieve personal belongs.&quot;

&quot;Quisty?&quot; Selphie frowned, worried by the sudden turn of events. The 
rest of Balamb&#146;s residents didn&#146;t seem to like the idea either.

&quot;You don&#146;t have the authority to do that.&quot; One Quistis&#146; fellow staff 
members scowled.

&quot;I do have the authority and I am using it.&quot; She said icily then turned 
to the gathering of junior SEEDs. &quot;I want all of you to watch over the 
evacuation. Nei, you&#146;re in charge, don&#146;t let anyone leave to get 
personal items. I want everyone gone ASAP.&quot;

&quot;Yes Ma&#146;am.&quot; The young woman saluted. &quot;But what about you guys?&quot;

&quot;Irvine, Fujin, you&#146;re with me. Selphie I want you one of the 
transports.&quot;

&quot;Like hell!&quot; The small woman exploded.

&quot;HEARD ORDER.&quot; Fujin barked, giving her a dirty look.

&quot;Fujin&#146;s right.&quot; Quistis soured.

&quot;It&#146;s okay.&quot; Irvine winked reassuringly at his soon to be wife. &quot;We&#146;ll 
go kill the nasty and have things back to normal before dinner.&quot;

&quot;You liar!&quot; Selphie shouted then scowled at Quistis. &quot;I&#146;m helping out 
and that&#146;s final, what are you going to do fire me?&quot;

Quistis had no time to argue right now.

&quot;Fine, you stay, for now, but if it hits the fan I want you gone, fast, 
got it&quot; She said with a severity that made the smaller woman cringe. 
&quot;You and Irvine go down to the hanger and prep the Ragnarok take a squad 
with you and be careful. Fujin and I will go to the bridge and see 
what&#146;s going on.&quot;

&quot;Yes Ma&#146;am.&quot; Selphie saluted as she pushed Irvine along. &quot;You heard the 
lady, let&#146;s go!&quot;

********************

It was late by time he arrived back at the palace. The guards greeted 
him wordlessly; everyone had heard about or seen the blowup with Rinoa. 
He ignored the quiet stares and made his way towards the entrance. The 
air was cool and crisp, and multicolored autumn leaves blew across his 
feet with a hushed whisper. He took a breath, and looked up at amber 
glow of a light shining in from several of palace&#146;s windows. He knew 
which room Rinoa was in and hoped to see her smiling down at him. He was 
disappointed, no one peered down at him, her window as dark as his mood.

He looked at Fujin&#146;s jacket, and frowned. He would&#146;ve never guessed that 
she of all people would be better at relationships than he was. It 
struck him as oddly funny and he shook his head and sighed.

&quot;Fancy meeting you out here stranger. Rinoa said, stepping out from the 
shadows cast by a standing of dogwood trees.

Startled slightly, Squall looked up and offered a thin smile.

&quot;Um, hi.&quot; He mumbled awkwardly, feeling stupid.

&quot;You missed dinner...&quot;

&quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;It was nice, Kiros of all people made us a veritable feast. I saved you 
a plate.&quot;

&quot;Thanks...&quot;

&quot;Who was that that dropped you off?&quot;

&quot;A friend of Fujin&#146;s.&quot; He answered, holding up Fujin&#146;s jacket.

&quot;Oh, hanging out with bikers now?&quot;

&quot;I guess she does.&quot;

&quot;I meant you.&quot;

&quot;Whatever.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m kidding.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot;

&quot;I...um.&quot; He started slowly, looking up at her.

&quot;Me first...&quot; She smiled, putting a hand to his lips. &quot;I&#146;m sorry, I 
really had no right blowing up like that...&quot;

&quot;I love you.&quot; He interrupted sheepishly.

Rinoa blinked.

&quot;I love you.&quot; He said again, this time more confidently.

&quot;You don&#146;t have to...&quot; She started.

&quot;I want you to know.&quot;

&quot;I do...&quot; She whispered, looking down at her feet.

&quot;Do you?&quot; He smiled, lifting her chin.

&quot;Sure.&quot; She mumbled.

He kissed her.

******************

Ordered chaos was the theme of the day. Everywhere, students and staff 
hurried to the several dozen escape transports that&#146;d been installed 
after the war. Streamlined and large enough to sit roughly twenty 
people, each transport was preprogrammed to fly to the nearest garden in 
the event of an accident. One by one the transports detached from hidden 
alcoves along Balamb&#146;s hull. Nida, who was still huddled among the 
sensor arrays, looked on in dismay as the small armada shot off into the 
distance. Things must be bad if they are abandoning ship. He shifted 
slightly, and groaned. It was cold, freezing, and wasn&#146;t dressed for 
such extremes, combined with the fact that he was going into shock 
didn&#146;t comfort him any. A loud hiss erupted above him and he was bathed 
in a cloud of steam. Large cables fell loose above his head and a panel 
swung down towards him. He shouted in surprise and rolled out of the way 
as the panel clanged loudly just inches above his head. The underbelly 
of an escape craft appeared as it hummed to life in preparation to take 
off.

&quot;Hyne...&quot; He cursed and crammed himself as tightly as he could behind on 
of the radio dishes. He prayed it was enough to protect him from the 
exhaust of the ship&#146;s departure. With a low roar the escape vehicle&#146;s 
engine came to life and within moments the entire ship was catapulted 
far into the horizon. Clouds of scorching smoke washed over Nida causing 
him to choke on the fumes. The cloud dissipated quickly and Nida opened 
his eyes blearily. He moaned in pain, the blast had nearly cooked him. 
His skin taking on the appearance of someone who&#146;d been badly sunburned.

He looked upward to the chamber that had contained the escape craft. The 
panel was still open and he started climbing towards it. It was a 
difficult and painful task but one he was determined to complete. 
Already the cold, biting wind was tearing at is now raw flesh. Though 
slightly comforting to his burns he knew he was now at greater risk of 
hypothermia. Once inside the housing he crawled to the airlock and 
peered through the window. He saw people rushing by and he banged on the 
glass and yelled as loud as he could. The weakness in his voice scared 
him. The thickness door made his attempt futile and he gave it up before 
he tired himself out. Calming himself, he though for a moment then 
brightened. Getting on his hands and knees, he searched along the bottom 
of the chamber for the door&#146;s manual release.

He was in luck and found the lever with little effort and pulled it. A 
loud clang issued from somewhere deep and the door pushed open slightly. 
With an eagerness that comes from desperation he pulled the doors open 
and lurched forward. Three young women were rushing by as he fell 
towards them, babbling incoherently. They screamed in fright and pushed 
him on his rear. Thankful to be alive, he couldn&#146;t help but smile in 
relief.

*********************

Quistis was driven, walking at a furious pace; Fujin had to jog to keep 
up.

&quot;QUISTIS?&quot; She asked. Lost in thought, Quistis didn&#146;t respond. Fujin 
finally grabbed her by the arm and brought her to an abrupt standstill. 
Quistis glared at her questioningly.

&quot;GIVE ME LOOK.&quot; Fujin frowned.

Quistis&#146; softened considerably.

&quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;HAVE PLAN?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;RECKLESS.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;ll not loose anyone else.&quot;

&quot;THEY SAFE.&quot;

&quot;Not as long as this thing has control.&quot;

&quot;MAY NOT.&quot;

&quot;We&#146;ll know when we get to the bridge.&quot;

&quot;BE CAUTIOUS.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re right, I&#146;m just upset.&quot;

&quot;UNDERSTANDABLE.&quot; Fujin smiled, brushing a lock of tangle hair from 
Quistis&#146; face. Quistis smiled and nodded in understanding.

&quot;I&#146;ll be careful.&quot;

&quot;LET&#146;S GO THEN.&quot; Fujin winked.

The darkness was overpowering and the mist that filled the halls made 
their flashlights all but useless. The heat and humidity also made it 
hard to breathe; making the trek all the more miserable.

The approached the elevator leading to the bridge and noticed a light 
flickering wildly in Cid&#146;s office to their left. The two women looked at 
each other and frowned. Fujin held up a hand to pause Quistis and 
proceeded to take point. Quistis frowned but fell instep behind the 
other woman&#146;s lead.

Pressing close against the wall just outside the office, Fujin peeked 
through half open door. The mist made it hard to see but she could make 
out shapes, inhuman shapes slithering about and waving in the air like 
cobras preparing to strike. Fujin looked to Quistis and pointed to the 
open door with a frown.

Quistis nodded and positioned herself in front of the partially closed 
door and focused for a spell. Remembering the effect Shiva had, she 
brought to mind a powerful freezing spell and hoped for the best. Fujin 
waited until she was ready then shoved the door open. The entities 
inside had just moments to react before Quistis unleashed the arctic 
blast upon them. A shower of frost and piercing ice crystals exploded 
into the room shredding and freezing everything in its radius of 
influence. Quistis winced, Cid would have a fit.

Seconds later the only sounds issuing from the room was the pops and 
cracks from the ice that covered the room. Fujin peeked inside, frozen 
motionless, were several fleshy tendrils lined with cables and wires of 
all types.

&quot;It&#146;s like in the hallway.&quot; Quistis noted, stepping just inside the 
room. Fujin nodded grimly and inspected one of the tendrils from a 
healthy distance.

&quot;LOOK.&quot; She scowled, pointing to Cid&#146;s computer terminal. The majority 
of the tendrils had merged with the computer and a bizarrely organic 
way.

&quot;What the...?&quot; Quistis mouthed quietly as she followed the tendrils back 
to their source, an air vent.

&quot;DOWNLOADING?&quot; Fujin wondered.

&quot;Perhaps, Cid has a lot of information in there...&quot;

&quot;BAD.&quot;

&quot;Very...&quot; Quistis said then thought a moment then pried a chair loose 
from the frozen floor and slammed it into the computer with all her 
might. The computer exploded into a shower of fragments and sparks.

Fujin jumped in surprise and shouted. &quot;DOING !?

&quot;If it wants our files then its imperative that it doesn&#146;t get them.&quot; 
Quistis sighed. &quot;Cid&#146;s going to kill me.&quot;

Fujin shook her head.

&quot;CONTROLS POWER.&quot; Fujin stated flatly, looking at the smoldering 
remains.

&quot;I kind of figured it did.&quot; Quistis smirked dryly. &quot;Come on lets get to 
the bridge.&quot;

They hurried out of office and to the elevator, which was running on 
emergency power. Pausing they looked at the open doors then exchanged 
glances.

&quot;No way.&quot; Quistis said firmly. Fujin nodded in agreement and they moved 
towards an access ladder instead. It was a short climb and Quistis 
pressed the release button that opened the hatch. Peeking out onto the 
bridge she was startled to see that all was quiet.

&quot;Odd.&quot; Quistis said quietly as she climbed out of the hatch. Fujin 
joined her and blinked curiously. Everything was in order; the bridge 
crew where sitting around bored and oblivious to the entrance.

&quot;Where&#146;s Nida?&quot; Quistis asked.

One of the girls turned slowly to regard them.

&quot;Miss Trepe?&quot; The nearest girl smiled and stood. A howling wind filled 
the chamber with blast of cold air and the girl cringed bitterly.

Quistis and Fujin looked at the bay window from which the gust of wind 
came.

&quot;What happened here?&quot; Quistis said warily.

&quot;Something outside hit the window it was horrible.&quot; The girl said, 
shivering.

&quot;Nida left to find you.&quot; Another girl said. It was cold in the room but 
not terribly so, but yet all three girls were as pale a Fujin.

&quot;Why haven&#146;t you evacuated...?&quot; Quistis asked, as the girl walked 
towards her. Her movements seemed slightly awkward; Quistis frowned as a 
smell caught her attention, foul, yet familiar.

&quot;We didn&#146;t hear anything about it?&quot; The approaching girl said in dismay, 
seconds before Fujin&#146;s chakram decapitated her.</pre>
