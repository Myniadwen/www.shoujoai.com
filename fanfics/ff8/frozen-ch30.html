It was fairly late by time Ragnarok neared its rendezvous with Balamb garden. After her 
impromptu piloting lesson Fujin had retired to the rear seats to where Quistis was. She sat 
close, somehow being near made her feel at ease. She leaned back comfortably as she let her 
mind wander. Gazing at the cold metallic ceiling she found herself nearly mesmerized buy 
the flickering blue overhead light. She reached out and tapped it with a finger, ceasing 
the distraction.

&quot;Almost home.&quot; She thought with a sigh.

&quot;Yo Fu?&quot; Zell called to her over his shoulder.

&quot;FUJIN!&quot; She snapped.

&quot;Whatever.&quot;

&quot;SILENCE.&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot;

&quot;QUISTIS SLEEPING.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re the one making the racket besides, she sleeps like the dead, and I&#39;ve got a 
question.&quot;

&quot;QUICK.&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to feel, I dunno, out of place in class with a bunch of newbies.&quot;

&quot;NOT CONCERNED.&quot;

&quot;Boy Rinoa was when she started classes.&quot;
&quot;NOT RINOA.&quot; She snapped.

&quot;Got that right.&quot; He mumbled.

&quot;IDIOT.&quot;

&quot;Ya know, I&#39;m not even going to dignify that with a response you monochromatic nightmare.&quot;

&quot;HUMPF.&quot;

&quot; I promised Miss Trepe to go easy on you, so you may as well just quit trying to get a 
rise out of me.&quot;

Fujin glanced over at Quistis and chuckled lightly.

&quot;You two seem to be getting along okay. Never thought I&#39;d see that.&quot;

Fujin chose to remain silent.

&quot;Not much of a talker are ya?&quot;

&quot;NO.&quot;

&quot;Why not, you have such a lovely voice.&quot; He joked, expecting her to fire back. When she 
said nothing he wished he&#39;d stayed quiet. An apology formed on his lips but he held it 
back, figuring it would only annoy her further.

&quot;We&#39;re home.&quot; He said dully after a few minutes. &quot;Go ahead and wake Miss Trepe.&quot;

Fujin leaned over to lightly shake her.

&quot;Wha?&quot; Quistis said in cute voice of the half awakened.
&quot;HOME.&quot; Fujin mumbled distantly.

&quot;Kay.&quot; Quistis said with a yawn as she sat up rubbing her eyes.

The Ragnarok circled Balamb Garden once as it prepared to land. Runner lights lit up around 
the entrance of the newly built hanger that served as the lair for the draconic craft.

The heavily fortified doors parted as the Ragnarok slowed to approach. Zell docked the 
craft without a hitch and soon everyone was getting ready to disembark. Fujin got her bags 
and hurried to the exit, Zell caught her arm to stop her.

&quot;Hey Fujin I just wanted to apol...&quot; He started but she turned on him, glaring hotly then 
yanked loose.

&quot;Fujin?&quot; Quistis asked, concerned as she stomped past her and down the gangplank.

&quot;Aw hell.&quot; Zell grumbled, Quistis turned to him cautiously.

&quot;What happened?&quot; She asked, her tone dark.

&quot;Eh well.&quot; He scratched his head and squinted, as he tried to figure out how to explain.

&quot;Never mind I can guess.&quot; Quistis sighed and looked to where Fujin left before turning back 
to Zell. &quot;Zell you promised.&quot; She sighed.

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to make her mad, we were just kiddin around.&quot; He hung his head, he hated 
being in trouble, especially with someone he respected as much as Miss Trepe.

She patted him on the shoulder.

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Quistis sighed sadly, trying not to sound as disappointed as she was. &quot;She&#39;s 
used to it.&quot; She added grimly before leaving him alone in the belly of the ship.

Zell stood silent as she jogged after Fujin.

&quot;Way to go slick.&quot; He mumbled to himself sourly.

&quot;Fu wait up!&quot; Quistis called out.

Fujin paused and turned.

&quot;Trying to get rid of me already huh.&quot; Quistis said with a light smile.

&quot;APOLOGY.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m joking hon.&quot; Quistis laughed, touching her arm reassuringly.

Fujin looked up the hall behind her.

&quot;He&#39;s signing in, what did he say to get you so upset?&quot;

&quot;DOESN&#39;T MATTER.&quot;

&quot;Aw Fu don&#39;t be like that.&quot;

Fujin shrugged and started walking again.

&quot;He didn&#39;t mean it, what ever it was.&quot;

&quot;NEVER WORK.&quot;

&quot;What won&#39;t&quot; Quistis asked fretfully, her stomach starting to knot at the possible answers.

&quot;GETTING ALONG.&quot;

&quot;Oh..&quot; Quistis sighed inwardly with relief having feared the worst. &quot;It&#39;ll take time hon.&quot;

&quot;DON&#39;T NEED THEM.&quot; Said with blunt sincerity.

&quot;True.&quot; Quistis chuckled. &quot;At least you have me.&quot; She said shyly as she leaned against her.

Fujin couldn&#39;t hold back the soft smile that found its way to her lips.

&quot;Ah there we go.&quot; Quistis winked.

&quot;HUMPF.&quot; Fujin huffed.

&quot;Yeah, whatever.&quot; She laughed as they walked into Balamb&#39;s central chamber.

&quot;Quiet night, where is everyone I wonder?&quot; She mused.

&quot;LATE, CLASSES.&quot;

&quot;Ew yeah that reminds me I have to talk to Cid in the morning about my job.&quot;

&quot;GOOD LUCK.&quot;

&quot;Thanks I&#39;ll need it.&quot;

They headed towards the elevator, passing a member of the security staff who watched them 
warily.

&quot;What&#39;s his problem?&quot; Quistis asked quietly as they stepped inside.
&quot;ME.&quot; Fujin responded simply.

&quot;You&#39;re paranoid.&quot;

&quot;Hold the elevator please.&quot; A voice called. Fujin jammed her hand in the closing doors to 
stop them. Both women were surprised as Edea stepped into the elevator.

&quot;Matron.&quot; Quistis said in greeting.

&quot;Hello dear.&quot; Edea nodded the looked at Fujin. &quot;Welcome home child.&quot;

Fujin stood stiffly and said nothing, she had no real love for Edea after what had 
happened. She realized it was really Ultimecia&#39;s doing but nonetheless she had trouble 
dealing with her.

&quot;Yeah we just got back.&quot; Quistis quickly interjected before an awkward silence started.

&quot;Safe and sound I see, was your stay pleasant?&quot; Edea said in her typical haunting tone 
that, to Quistis found distracting at times.

&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am we had a great time.&quot; Quistis smiled and looked at Fujin, who just nodded 
stone-faced.

&quot;Wonderful, perhaps Cid and I will venture there. What was the place called again dear?&quot;

&quot;Snow Ridge.&quot;

&quot;Snow Ridge, very good.&quot; The elevator dinged and the door slid open. &quot;Here is my stop. You 
two be well.&quot; She said with a solem nod before exiting the elevator. Fujin waited for the 
door to shut before breathing again.

&quot;You okay?&quot; Quistis asked, worried.

Fujin nodded stiffly as she unlocked the panel covering the button to the lower levels of 
the garden. As the elevator descended she quietly pressed close against Quistis and rested 
her head against her chest in a soft embrace. Quistis welcomed her with an embrace and 
kissed the top of her head.

&quot;It&#39;ll be okay.&quot; She murmured.

Fujin rubbed her eye with her palm in a gesture Quistis had come to realize signified 
distress.

&quot;Don&#39;t let them get you down hon. Your better than that, besides who cares what they think, 
right?&quot; She said with a hint of playfulness.

Fujin gave a faint shrug, Quistis sighed and held her tighter.

The elevator slowed and stopped, Fujin turned her head as the door opened to her quarters.

&quot;GOODBYE?&quot; She asked with heartfelt regret as she step back a step.

&quot;I can stay if you want me to hon.&quot; Quistis said a gentle smile as she ran her fingers 
through Fujin&#39;s sliver white hair. Fujin looked thoughtful a moment then her expression 
turn downcast.

&quot;NOT FOR BEST.&quot;

&quot;You sure?&quot;

&quot;TROUBLE FOR YOU.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not trouble Fu I told you that.&quot;
Fujin found herself blushing again, such a funny feeling she thought. Though it was one she 
was getting accustomed to with Quistis around lately.

&quot;YOU REST.&quot;

&quot;Okay then, give me a call if you need me.&quot;

Fujin wasn&#39;t sure how to act or what to say as stepped to the open door with awkward 
nervousness.

&quot;I love you.&quot; Quistis said with a breezy smile

Fujin paused and turned back to face her, Quistis nearly giggled at the sheepish look on 
her face. Fujin stepped towards her with a cautiousness Quistis found adorable.

Fujin wanted to speak her feelings too but her words, broken and aggressive did them little 
justice. She instead caught Quistis in a gentle embrace and kissed her tenderly. Quistis 
tingled at the kiss, and her heart soared once more, only to fall back again as Fujin 
stepped away.

&quot;GOODNIGHT.&quot; She said thickly, and with an expression Quistis found downright sultry.

&quot;Night.&quot; Quistis waved.

Fujin stepped out of the elevator and hit the button to close the doors. She returned the 
wave with a shy smile. After she&#39;d gone Fujin frowned and looked around her chambers and 
immediately felt lonely.

Zell strolled glumly up the halls. He was mad at himself now, he didn&#39;t actually mean to 
hurt her feelings, he thought Fujin had thicker skin than that and now Quistis was upset 
with him.

&quot;Once again I screwed up.&quot; He mumbled dully.

&quot;Zell.&quot; A voice called as he passed a vending room. It was Irvine and Celest, they where 
sitting at the small table amid soda and snack machines.

&quot;Hey guys.&quot; Zell said blandly.

&quot;Seems he&#39;s in a good mood too.&quot; Celest said, still sporting a vicious bruise on her jaw.

&quot;Have a seat buddy.&quot; Irvine gestured.

&quot;Sure why not. What are you two up to?&quot;

&quot;Sitting here trying to figure out what to do now that my dear brother is homeless.&quot;

&quot;Homeless? It was your apartment?&quot; Zell scoffed.

&quot;Yeah well I don&#39;t want to go back there right now while she&#39;s there.&quot;

&quot;Whoa dude put her out.&quot; Zell said simply.

&quot;Works for me bro.&quot; Celest chirped.

&quot;No.&quot; Irvine balked then thought a moment. &quot;No!?&quot; He shook his head.

&quot;Why the hell not?&quot; Zell threw his hands up in the air.

&quot;Because.&quot;

&quot;Because why?&quot; Celest arched a brow and leaned towards him.

&quot;It wouldn&#39;t be right.&quot;

&quot;Dude she attacked you and your sister, and worse yet me!?.&quot;

&quot;And Squall.&quot; Celest added as she sipped her tea.&quot;

&quot;Yeah and Squall.&quot;

&quot;Guys, no. I&#39;m not putting her out, that&#39;s just rude.&quot; Irvine said sternly.

&quot;Dude where are you gonna sleep then? Under Cid&#39;s desk.&quot;

&quot;Um I was thinking your place actually.&quot;

&quot;Ack nadda guy, Nikki would have a utter fit. Besides we pretty much live in a closet 
sorry. What about Celest.&quot;

&quot;Sorry we&#39;ve been over this, no guys in the girls dorm, and I&#39;ve got a roommate and one 
room.&quot;

&quot;Hey how about Squall he&#39;s gotta a fly pad.&quot; Zell said cheerily.

Celest and Irvine both made a similar face.

&quot;Um no.&quot; They said in unison.

&quot;Why the hell not!?&quot;
&quot;He made it clear he doesn&#39;t want to hear about anymore of this or he&#39;s gonna fine us for 
the fire in the hall.&quot; Irvine pointed out.

&quot;That wasn&#39;t your fault, she&#39;s the one who set fire to your stuff.&quot; Zell countered.

&quot;I thought you said Selphie was sweet.&quot; Celest sighed.

&quot;She is, honestly but with us going to Trabia combined with that mess with Fujin really put 
her in a mood. To be honest I haven&#39;t helped matters any either, she&#39;s right, I do have a 
tendency to flirt, and that gets on her nerves.&quot; Irvine admitted.

&quot;You cad.&quot; Celest shoved him. &quot;You didn&#39;t tell me you deserved it.&quot;

&quot;Hey now!?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re the one I should be mad at.&quot; She sulked.

&quot;Alright guys, this ain&#39;t helping.&quot; Zell said, getting up to get a drink.

&quot;He&#39;s right.&quot; Irvine tried.

&quot;You&#39;re changing the subject.&quot;

&quot;Come on guys it&#39;s getting late, lets try to focus.&quot; Zell frowned as he sat back down.

&quot;Okay, okay.&quot; Celest sat back in her seat annoyed.

&quot;Well guy there is always Miss Trepe.&quot; Zell said bluntly then tossed back his drink.

&quot;Quistis!?&quot; Irvine choked.

&quot;Yeah man, she&#39;s got her own apartment and she lives alone, she&#39;s got plenty of room.&quot;

&quot;There you go.&quot; Celest clapped him on the back. &quot;Instructor Trepe.&quot;

&quot;Um she&#39;s on vacation.&quot; Irvine blurted.

&quot;Nope I just brought her and Fujin back.&quot; Zell smirked.

&quot;Who the heck it Fujin?&quot; Celest broke in.

&quot;Mean little lady, Zell and the others had to fight her on occasion, you see her probably 
best to go the other way.&quot; Irvine said.

&quot;Eh she&#39;s not that bad, not anymore anyway. But that&#39;s not we&#39;re talking about.&quot; Zell 
leaned over to eye Irvine. &quot;You gonna ask her or what?&quot;

&quot;I dunno, it seems just asking for trouble.&quot;

&quot;Miss Trepe is cool, she won&#39;t mind, you want me to ask her?&quot;

Irvine whistled. &quot;I dunno.&quot;

Zell got up and ran out into the hall.

&quot;What the?&quot; Celest stammered.

&quot;Zell!? Don&#39;t you do it!&quot; Irvine jumped up after him, with Celest right behind.

They chased him up the hall. Celest grabbed Irvine by his shirt.

&quot;Irvine slow down! I&#39;m not really equipped to be running ya know.&quot;

Irvine slowed to a brisk walk and gave her a foul look.

&quot;He&#39;s gonna get me in trouble.

&quot;Hey who knows, perhaps he&#39;s right. Miss Trepe seems nice enough.&quot; She shrugged.

&quot;I used to flirt with her I can&#39;t ask her to put me up she&#39;ll think I&#39;m trying to make a 
pass, like I&#39;m on the rebound or something.&quot;

&quot;Aha! See I get it now, you wet the bed you sleep in it ya jerk.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s gross.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re gross, I hope she makes you sleep in the tub.&quot;

&quot;Great, now I&#39;m getting flak from you.&quot;

&quot;Brought it on yourself.&quot; She clapped him on the back as they rounded the corner.

&quot;There he is.&quot; Irvine, ran up to him as Zell banged on Quistis&#39;s door again.

&quot;Miss Trepe are you home?&quot;

&quot;Zell stop it!&quot; Irvine grabbed him, meaning to drag him off.

The door opened, Quistis poked her head out sourly. &quot;Can I help you?&quot; She said, still 
dripping water from her rudely interrupted bath.

&quot;My buddy Irvine here.&quot; Zell started, before being shoved aside by Irvine who just waved 
and smiled.

&quot;Sorry to interrupt you ma&#39;am.&quot; He said awkwardly.

Quistis shut the door and checked her robe before stepping out into the hall.

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Quistis studied the trio warily.

&quot;Hi Miss Trepe I&#39;m Celest, Irvine&#39;s sister.&quot; She offered her hand, Quistis shook it, still 
eyeing them with a great deal of suspicion.

&quot;Nice to meet you Celest, Zell&#39;s told me about you, sorry about Selphie she&#39;s not usually 
not like that.&quot;

&quot;So I&#39;ve heard, anyway, Irvine here.&quot; She pointed to her sibling who was busy tussling with 
Zell.

&quot;Well to be blunt, he needs a place to stay.&quot; She smiled broadly.

Irvine set Zell loose and slapped his forehead.

&quot;Damnit Celest.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re joking.&quot; Quistis said evenly.

Zell set his hand on Irvine&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Nope, with him and Selphie goin at it, he needs a place to shack up till they sort it 
out.&quot;

&quot;Oh guys that&#39;s not a good idea.&quot; Quistis shook her head cautiously.

&quot;Aw come on Miss Trepe, look at him, he&#39;s homeless it&#39;s pitiful.&quot;

&quot;Irvine, can&#39;t you stay with Celest?&quot;

&quot;Nope I have a roommate.&quot; Celest smiled apologetically.

&quot;Zell?&quot;

&quot;Nikki wouldn&#39;t have it, sorry.&quot;

&quot;How about?&quot; She started but Zell cut her off.

&quot;Nope he said it&#39;s all between us he&#39;s not getting in it anymore.&quot;

Irvine looked sheepishly and shrugged.

&quot;You guys are putting me on the spot here.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;ll do it!&quot; Zell said merrily.

&quot;I dunno?.&quot; Quistis could only imagine what Fujin would think.

Everyone pouted at her and she slumped under the weight of it.

&quot;Damn it.&quot; She cursed under her breath. &quot;Come on you lummox.&quot;

She stepped aside and gestured inside.

&quot;Really!?&quot; Zell stood shocked.

&quot;Are you Irvine?&quot; Quistis snapped, causing Zell to back up.

&quot;Err sorry.&quot;

&quot;Thank Quisty.&quot; Irvine said with a slow smile.

Quistis buried her finger in his chest poignantly.

&quot;No funny business mister or I&#39;ll beat you senseless.&quot; She said with no hint at humor.

&quot;So says the woman with the whip, sounds fun.&quot; Irvine smirked.

Everyone hit him simultaneously.

Everyone had left, Zell dug up some standard gray school sweats for Irvine to wear till he 
could buy some new clothes, very few people in Balamb was anywhere near his height.

Quistis drug a bundle of sheets and pillows out of the closet for him.

&quot;Here you go.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Quisty.&quot; Irvine said blushing in embarrassment.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?&quot;

&quot;I feel like an idiot.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;
&quot;The situation I&#39;m in. Putting you in this position.&quot;

&quot;Bah, it&#39;s not a problem hon. You&#39;re a friend in need who am I to say no. You&#39;d do it for 
me I hope.&quot;

&quot;Of course, I&#39;d never say no to a lady.&quot; He winked.

&quot;Un huh, that&#39;s what got this started.&quot; She said coyly before heading to her room.

&quot;Leaving so soon?&quot; Irvine smiled.

&quot;Goodnight Kinneas.&quot;

&quot;Quistis.&quot; He called cutely.

She sighed. &quot;Yes Irvine.&quot;

&quot;Will you tuck me in.&quot;

&quot;Go to bed you goof.&quot; She shut her door.

&quot;Quistis.&quot; He called again.

&quot;What!?&quot; She snapped.

&quot;Tell me a story.&quot;

She chuckled to herself but did not answer as she slipped into bed.

Irvine meanwhile looked around the darkened living room as he stripped to his boxers. He 
folded his clothes neatly and draped them over a near chair. He already missed Selphie, he 
hated when they fought, and this was the worse one yet. They&#39;d been having a lot of 
problems recently, she was hyper and always on the move, while he preferred to go along for 
the ride.

It was never a problem until recently now it seemed they got on each other&#39;s nerves, it was 
just a matter of time before something snapped. He just hoped it could be fixed. He groaned 
in distress as he fell face first onto the couch, knowing his thoughts would keep him up 
until the wee hours of the morning.

It was something Fujin rarely did; sleeping in was just not in her nature but this time she 
allowed herself the luxury. She knew Quistis would not be up and about until later in the 
morning so she decided to wait, hopefully she could catch her before she went to talk to 
Cid. She looked down fondly at the photograph of her she&#39;d taken from Quistis&#39;s apartment.

&quot;Time to go.&quot; She thought as she glanced at the clock.

She hurried into the elevator with her gym bag thrown over her shoulder, it&#39;d been to long 
since she had any exercise that didn&#39;t include falling down a mountain or dying from heat 
exhaustion. She made her way quickly to Quistis&#39;s apartment and knocked lightly on the 
door, a slight smile on her lips as she waited for an answer. They&#39;re was a loud thud 
followed by the muffled cursing of an unfamiliar voice, Fujin&#39;s smile melted into a look of 
alarm. She braced for anything but was no where near prepared for what greeted her.

&quot;Hey little lady.&quot; Irvine said in his classic drawl as he rubbed his eyes sleepily. Fujin 
looked him over once and immediately tensed up and set her jaw. He stood before her in 
unshaven, half naked glory clad only in morning hair and ill fitting silk boxer shorts.

&quot;KINNEAS.&quot; She all but hissed.
