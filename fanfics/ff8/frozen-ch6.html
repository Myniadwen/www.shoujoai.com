<a href="../ff8/frozen-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>(Misssing) Lyrics: by Everything but the girl
I step off the train,
I&#39;m walking down your street again,
and past your door,
but you don&#39;t live there anymore. It&#39;s years since you&#39;ve been there.
Now you&#39;ve disappeared somewhere
like outer space,
you&#39;ve found some better place, and I miss you
- like the deserts miss the rain. Could you be dead?
You always were two steps ahead
of everyone.
We&#39;d walk behind while you would run. I look up at your house,
and I can almost hear you shout
down to me
where I always used to be, and I miss you -
like the deserts miss the rain. Back on the train,
I ask why did I come again.
Can I confess
I&#39;ve been hanging around your old address? And the years have proven
to offer nothing since you moved.
You&#39;re long gone
but I can&#39;t move on, and I miss you -
like the deserts miss the rain



Missing

Fujin looked out the window, her expression dull and tired. She barely 
noticed as the train crossed onto the immense bridge stretching across 
the sea. Her thoughts kept drifting back to Balamb and to her. She 
longed for something to get her mind off her but she couldn&#146;t help it.

&quot;What about that woman has you acting like a complete imbecile?&quot; She 
wondered. She was not ready to really think about it. She had myriad of 
unknown emotions flitting about and sorely needed to clear her head. She 
saw her face in her minds eye and it made her weak, and feeling more 
alone now than ever. Somehow in one night she had come to mean a lot to 
her. It was such a simple series of gestures, dinner, the toast, and 
more than anything understanding. She hadn&#146;t tried to judge her or 
condemn her for her past sins. She accepted her as she was. She 
remembered her hands, soft and gently like silk caressing her skin. She 
shivered at the memory.

&quot;Quistis..&quot; She thought as she let the rumble of the train rock her 
asleep.

*********************

Quistis was in shock, she looked about in stark fear. She felt as if she 
was in some horrid dream, everyone was moving in slow motion. She saw 
Rinoa talking to her but she didn&#146;t hear her or even care.

&quot;You ran her off.&quot; She told herself flatly. &quot;You where so desperate to 
find anyone to cling to. You chased her off.&quot;

&quot;I did not mean to.&quot;

&quot;She hates you!&quot;

&quot;Forgive me.&quot;

&quot;Your a failure.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t leave me.&quot;

&quot;Its to late now!&quot;

&quot;Please.&quot;

&quot;Give up!&quot;

&quot;I just wanted...&quot;

&quot;Wanted what!?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;Say it!&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m Sorry...&quot;

&quot;Do everyone a favor and just end it.&quot;

&quot;sorry......&quot;

&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot; Rinoa said arching a brow. Quistis looked at her in 
a daze.

&quot;I said I&#146;m sorry I didn&#146;t hear you.&quot; She replied with an oddly quite 
tone.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Rinoa looked worried and the class where whispering and 
staring.

&quot;I was just lost in thought is all&quot; She said with a soulless smile that 
left Rinoa chilled.

&quot;Okay then.&quot; She replied and went to sit back down.

Quistis went about her class as normal and without a hint of the 
terrible thing that was destroying her very soul. It was like a 
relentless beast, savaging her brutally. She stopped fighting it and 
accepted it. Knowing full well that it would finally take her and leave 
her rotting and forgotten.

After class the Treppies all gathered around telling her inane and 
pointless gossip as always. She humored them with porcelain smiles and 
false laughs. How would they feel she wondered if they really knew their 
so called idol was really only so much offal. Would they scrape and 
worship over her then. She was tempted to show them all the darkness 
within and destroy them with it. Anger seethed within her, contempt of 
their smiling faces. Even Rinoa, doting, ever loyal Rinoa.

She hated herself the minute she thought it. She took the dark emotions 
still swirling in her and turned them inward.

&quot;You would hurt your friends with your own anguish? how petty, how weak. 
But that pretty much sums you up doesn&#146;t it.&quot; She thought bitterly, 
feeding the beast further. With a sad smile she stood, drawing looks 
from everyone gathered about. She went to each of them one by one and 
embraced them tightly. Rinoa grinned widely at this even more so when it 
was her turn.

&quot;Thank you everyone.&quot; Quistis smiled warmly. Aeka a junior Treppie 
fainted.

&quot;Oh my goodness.&quot; Rinoa said in surprise as she looked at the swooning 
girl.

Quistis watched quietly as they shook the young girl awake.

&quot;Ahem.&quot; She coughed getting everyone&#146;s attention.

&quot;How would you all like to go on a field trip.&quot; She said flatly.

Cheers echoed in the room. Rinoa looked at her with a puzzled grin. She 
was up to something and she knew it. Quistis went to her desk and pulled 
out a few forms. She quickly scribbled on them then passed them out.

&quot;Where are we going Miss Trepe?&quot; Royce said surprised.

&quot;Just call me Quistis when we are not in class hon.&quot;

The Treppies burst into babbling whispers immediately, some even elbowed 
their so called leader.

Quistis grinned and knelt to get her bag. Rinoa watched her closely 
trying to read her.

&quot;Yeah where we going Quisty?&quot; She said, purposely using her pet name in 
front of the other students knowing it usually got a rise from her.

&quot;Eshtar&quot; Quistis said simply. Not biting at Rinoa&#146;s bait or even 
acknowledging it.

Cheers went up again. She slung her satchel over her shoulder and 
grinned brightly.

&quot;I will talk to Cid and Squall at the meeting this afternoon. Hopefully 
we will be able to go as soon as we leave Trabia, since we will be in 
the region..&quot;

More cheers, Rinoa stood quiet with only a paper smile. Something scared 
her something bad.

Quistis shepherd everyone out of the room and locked the door. Rinoa and 
her stood alone in the hall. Rinoa tagged along quietly as she went to 
the meeting.

&quot;Something up Rinoa?&quot; Quistis said with bright smile. Rinoa had to about 
jog to keep up with the taller woman&#146;s leggy strides.

&quot;Um I hate to ask this, but well. Me and Squall got in a big argument 
and I need some time to cool off. I was wondering if I could stay the 
night at your place?..&quot; Rinoa hated lying more than anything.

&quot;Sure Hon.&quot; Quistis responded without a second thought.

&quot;Cool thanks.&quot; Rinoa said dumbfounded, she had expected a excuse or 
something.

They got in the elevator and waited as it rose to Cid&#146;s office.

&quot;Rinoa.&quot; Quistis said as she toyed with her hairpin.

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;Did you and Squall really get in a fight?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Rinoa looked down at her feet ashamed.

&quot;Silly.&quot; Quistis grinned and hugged her. &quot;I know your worried about me, 
but I will be fine. Trust me I feel better than I have in a long time.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Rinoa wasn&#146;t to sure, something still frightened her terribly.

&quot;I&#146;m sure. But by all means feel free to swing by I could use the 
company.&quot;

&quot;Okay I will do that can, I bring Selphie or Nicole?&quot;

&quot;Sure invite em both, it will be just us gals.&quot; Quistis grinned 
wolfishly, making Rinoa crack up.

The Elevator dinged and the doors opened. Quistis stepped out into the 
hall and waved goodbye to Rinoa. Rinoa waved back brightly, feeling much 
better. The door shut and Quistis&#146;s grin suddenly melted into a sullen 
scowl. Somewhere in the darkness of her soul the beast howled in 
pleasure.

******************************

The man sitting next to me smells of sex and cigarettes. He is a 
lecherous one, who lets himself &quot;accidentally&quot; graze my breasts as she 
he shuffles past me on the way to the lavatory. He has done so six times 
since the trip started. Every time he returns I smell the heavy scent of 
his maleness on his hands and it sickens me to be near him. I have the 
urge to pummel him senseless but a security officer is conveniently 
nearby and I have no desire to be set off the train. I lay my head back 
and try to relax. I am tired but dare not sleep again, The first time it 
tried, I awoke to the ogre next to me breathing down my neck. I count 
the hours till my destination and hope I am doing the right thing. My 
thoughts run to you again.

Perhaps I should have said something, but no I was to shy to tell you. 
Yes I can be shy, absurd I know but I am only human and have human 
frailties. I fear being social, I am ill equipped for it. I&#146;m crude, I 
look different, I talk different, and I&#146;m not pretty. You on the other 
hand are, polite, eloquent, sophisticated, and beautiful. You are strong 
my friend, yes I call you friend perhaps my only real one. I hope you 
will be safe in my absence.

&quot;SHOULD HAVE SAID.&quot; I murmur annoyed at my own stupidity for just 
leaving.

&quot;Should have said what my precious.&quot; The beast next to me grunts as he 
puts a hand on my thigh. Moments later I find myself in a holding cell 
in the back of the train, smiling like a well fed cat.

********************************

Later that night Quistis answered the door wearing her new black 
nightgown and a holding bag of popcorn. Rinoa, Nicole and Selphie also 
dressed in their gowns and pajamas, applauded and fawned over her as 
they entered.

&quot;Oh who&#146;s the lucky guy?&quot; Rinoa whistled.

Quistis looked at her like that was an absurd question.

&quot;Selphie talked me into buying it the other day.&quot;

&quot;Yup and can I call em or what, you look lovely.&quot; Selphie clapped 
merrily.

&quot;Well girls what did you bring.&quot; Quistis asked poking around in the bag 
Selphie had in her hand.

&quot;Well the library still has a bunk collection.&quot; Selphie said in dismay. 
&quot;But I think you&#146;ll like em.&quot;

&quot;No more, Romancing the bone. Or Highway men. I hope.&quot; Rinoa blushed 
with a disgusted face.

&quot;No. No more romancing the wah! Or Highway wah! I poop!&quot; Selphie whined 
back at her mockingly. Rinoa stuck her tongue out and threw a handful of 
Quistis&#146;s popcorn at her.

&quot;Girls, Girls. Lets be adults her shall we.&quot; Quistis tried thinly.

&quot;Okay Miss Trepe.&quot; Rinoa said pouting, only to stick her tongue out at 
her when she turned around.

&quot;Ohhh I&#146;m telling.&quot; Selphie grinned and pushed her playfully.&quot;

&quot;Why you brat!&quot; Rinoa grabbed her in a headlock.

&quot;Hey watch it you oaf!&quot; Selphie whined as she tried to stomp her foot.

Quistis ignored them with a grin and rummaged through the movies looking 
for something she liked.

Nicole tip toed around the roiling pile of arms and legs to join her on 
the couch.

&quot;Gonna be a long night I think&quot; She said peaceably.

&quot;Nah.&quot; Quistis said kicking her feet on the table as the movie started.

**************************************

Irvine could eat his hat. He looked at the clock, it was damn near ten. 
He and Squall sat on the garishly colored sofa in the middle of the 
apartment. Squall sat obviously bored out of his skull. He would rather 
swallow his gunblade than be here.

&quot;Think he will figure it out.&quot; Irvine said.

&quot;WHY THE HELL IS IT BLINKING!&quot; Zell roared from behind the massive 
projection television that sat in front of the Duo.

Sqaull shook his head and slumped further in his chair and looked up at 
the ceiling.

&quot;What hell kind of movies does he even have. Something will girls in it 
I hope.&quot; Irvine said getting flustered. Squall reached down and grabbed 
a handful of cassettes and tossed them in Irvine&#146;s lap.

&quot;Huh?&quot; He looked down at the tapes and studied them.

&quot;Love is a yellow bus?, Roses and magnolias?, The rain dancer swoons???? 
What the hell??&quot; Irvine hung his head.

&quot;This is hell.&quot; He finally said weakly.

Squall nodded in agreement as, he marveled at the symmetrical patterns 
of the ceiling tiles. A loud pop and a flash startled them. Smoke was 
rising from the TV causing Zell to spew a string of obscenities that 
could kill a dragon. Then the lights went out, more cursing from Zell 
and they could hear angry and startled cries echoing up the hall. After 
a brief moment the lights came back on.

&quot;Some mechanical wiz kid.&quot; Irvine mumbled.

&quot;Hey up yours you cow poker.&quot; Zell yelled flipping him off.

&quot;Kiss your mother with that mouth boy.&quot;

&quot;No but I do something to yours with it.&quot; Zell spat back with venom.

&quot;Why you little punk.&quot; Kinneas stood, Squall grabbed him by the coat and 
yanked him back in his seat. With a sigh he got up and shoved Zell out 
from behind the TV. Zell protested acutely and glared at Kinneas. Squall 
fiddled around with the knot of cables and wires for a few moment before 
hitting the power. The screen blinked and came to life, Squall then 
grabbed a tape shoved it in the player and plopped back down on the 
couch without so much of a huff.

&quot;Dirty little.&quot; Zell said annoyed.

&quot;Oh look its Pam Pam pandas big day.&quot; Irvine said disgusted.

Squall resumed his tile counting.
