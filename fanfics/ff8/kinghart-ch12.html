<p align="center">Dancing with Death</p>
<p>Xu stopped  dead. Her heart felt like it had been ripped to shreds for no apparent reason.  She clutched at her chest, struggling to deal with the feeling that had coursed  through her body unexpectedly.</p>
<p>“Xu? Are  you ok?” Selphie asked as they paused in front of the shrine. She shook her  head.</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’m  just fine…” She replied. Squall grunted in response and they kept running.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Rinoa woke  up alone. The effects of the spell had finally worn off but she was all alone  and in the cold. Somehow, she had managed to end up outside but she had no idea  where she was. She didn’t even have her weapons.</p>
<p>“Quistis?”  She said aloud, hoping for an answer. Instead, the wind howled with glee at its  new prey. “Squall…” she whispered and curled up next to the wall. It was dark  and scary and she didn’t want to be alone anymore. She cried softly, frightened  like a little child. Then, as if on cue, the memory of Squall brought strength  into her and she remembered Quistis’s wise words. <em>Stand up and be strong!</em> She sniffed once more before standing up and looking around. She was stuck  somewhere and by the look of the scenery, on Centra. But Centra was huge and dangerous.  She didn’t even have any weapons to fight with and if she encountered something  now…<em>Squall would rather see you alive!</em> She wiped her eyes and moved  forward, clutching her arms in the cold and fright. She wondered where Quistis  went and suddenly, the memory of that strange man brought back the horrific  scene.</p>
<p>“Quistis!”  She hissed. Just as she said it, a monster roared nearby and she hurried along,  trying hard not to panic.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Rinoa!”  Squall yelled. He sprinted through the hallways, screaming her name. It was a  prison alright, a dark a musky one at that. “Rinoa!!” Xu and the others  followed him closely, yelling just as loudly. Zell ran head first into Squall  who stopped at a standstill. He was staring at a broken door.</p>
<p>“Hey, watch  it, man!” Zell snapped, getting up after falling. Squall knelt to inspect the  door.</p>
<p>“It’s  fresh. The door was knocked down recently and I think that it might’ve been  Quistis and Rinoa.” Irvine walked ahead and rounded the corner. After a moment,  he came back with a whip and a pinwheel.</p>
<p>“No doubt  about it. It’s theirs.” He said, tossing the weapons to his teammates. “But  they’re not here. The room back there is completely a dead end.”</p>
<p>“Where  could they have gone?” Selphie wondered.</p>
<p>“They  must’ve escaped. Let’s go back up and check on foot to find them.” Irvine  suggested. Xu looked down at the broken door. She had a bad feeling about  everything.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><em>“And?”  Xu asked.</em></p>
<p><em> “What do  you mean ‘and?’” Quistis asked.</em></p>
<p><em> “Come  on, you know hiding it from me won’t do you any good. You’re much too obvious.  You came into the SeeD party glowing with Instructor Mesh at your side. Don’t  tell me that you’re not seeing each other. In fact, I’ve got a sneaky suspicion  that you’ve been seeing each other for a while.” She smirked devilishly.  Quistis was unable to keep a smile off her face.</em></p>
<p><em> “Ok,  fine, we’ve been seeing each other for a year.”</em></p>
<p><em> “A  YEAR?? AND YOU DIDN’T TELL ME?!” Xu yelled in surprise.</em></p>
<p><em> “Shh!”  Quistis hissed. “Yeah.”</em></p>
<p><em> “So…um…this  might be an awkward question but have you two…ya know…” She scratched her head,  trying to put it mildly. “Um…I mean it just seems liked you walked in and…”</em></p>
<p><em> “We  have.” Quistis giggled. Xu all but choked.</em></p>
<p><em> “HYNE!  YOU??? PERFECT QUISTY?” She gasped. “I never would’ve thought that you…with and  older man at that…I…”</em></p>
<p><em> “You  make it sound dirtier than it is.” Quistis replied calmly.</em></p>
<p><em> “Well  yeah! Maybe because it is! He’s an instructor! Kinda older. Also, he was your  teacher and you were his student! Can I say scandalous?” Xu blurted.</em></p>
<p><em> “Maybe  it is but…I mean…I love him thought.” Quistis looked sheepishly at the ground,  blushing. “I mean, sure…there’s a lot of stuff that could become potential  threats to his career but I don’t know…I love him. I’ve never felt this way  before in my life. It’s like he’s opened up a whole other world for me.”</em></p>
<p><em> “And  me?” Quistis’s head shot up. She was staring at a much older Xu. Her expression  was haunted, chilling. “What? You take my love for granted and throw it away at  your convenience? Sorry, love, but I love you like it’s the real deal, whether  you want me or not. I’ll never let you go.”</em></p>
<p><em> “Xu…?”</em></p>
<p><em> “Let me  waste away then. I know you love me too. You’re just too cowardly to admit it.  Voices? HAH! I’ll be you’re just making that up. If you don’t want me, if  you’re ashamed then say so, don’t beat around the bush.”</em></p>
<p><em> “No,  it’s not imaginary.”</em></p>
<p><em> “Oh?  You’re going to let some voice run your world? You’re even stupider than I  thought. You loved Arik even though it could’ve gotten you into trouble, why  not me?”</em></p>
<p><em> “But  your life is on the line…really!”</em></p>
<p><em> “If you  want to protect me, then love me.” With that, Xu drew a sharp, glistening blade  from her pocket and pulled it across her skin. Quistis screamed.</em></p>
<p>Quistis  screamed when she woke up. She couldn’t feel her body, she couldn’t think. All  she saw was white and all she could do was scream.</p>
<p>“Silence  her!” A voice ordered. By pure reaction, she bit down on the hand that tried to  cover her mouth.</p>
<p>“Fuck!” The  voice yelled, pulling his bleeding hand away. Quistis struggled with all her  might but she had been strapped down. There were people dressed in white coats  but had not bothered to cover their face. She couldn’t recognize a single one  of them though. She was strapped to a sheet of metal and her feet could’ve  touched the ground. They hadn’t laid her down, instead, she was upright. There  were scientists in front, typing stuff on massive computers. There were other  scientists standing beside her and behind her with notepads, studying her as if  she were some fascinating creature. Wires hung from her body.</p>
<p>“Where the  fuck am I?!” She screamed. Quistis was not one for cursing but the pain that  was going through her body, combined with the fact that people were studying  her, experimenting on her and her obliviousness to what was going on added to  the pressure. “Get me out of here!”</p>
<p>“Restrain  her!” The voice yelled again. She thrashed wildly, trying to get free.  Suddenly, she felt something poke her in the shoulder. At first, she kept  trying to break free but gradually, she realized that it was a sedative. Not a  very strong one but enough to stop her limbs from moving. But she was still  awake.</p>
<p>“That’s  better. Alright, send shockwave one.” A sudden jolt ran through her and it felt  like everything in her body was electrified. She screamed loudly, the pain just  too much to bear. Luckily, it was short. The scientists were scribbling madly.</p>
<p>“Interesting…”  one of the scientists at the computer said. “Very, very interesting. Her brain  waves are unbelievable…they’re absolutely fascinating.”</p>
<p>“Stop it…”  Quistis whispered, her head hung down.</p>
<p>“Shockwave  2.” He commanded and another one coursed through her body. This time, she  couldn’t scream anymore. She didn’t want to either. She didn’t want to give  them the satisfaction.</p>
<p>“See?” He  pointed to the monitor. “They just keep getting more and more erratic when they  should be dying out.” Quistis could’ve scoffed if she had the strength to. She <em>was</em> dying if they hadn’t noticed. “You think  one more will trigger it?” <em>No more…</em>Quistis thought. <em>It hurts…</em></p>
<p>“Shockwave 3!” And suddenly, Quistis  lost herself. Before she knew what happened, her body reacted on its own. A  purple pulse radiated from her body, slamming all the scientists into the wall  and frying the computers and their systems. With strength she did not know that  she possessed, she broke free of her restrains and dashed up to the one who had  been giving the commands. She grabbed him by the head and dragged him all the  way over to the metal wall. She rammed his head against it, sending electricity  to the tips of her fingers, frying the man.</p>
<p>“HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?!” She roared.  “Like that do ya? Want me to check your brainwaves?!” The man whimpered and she  electrocuted him to death on the spot. The other scientists scrambled to get  away. Quistis turned around, but she wasn’t herself anymore. Somewhere, a demon  had awoken within her and it wanted to destroy them all.</p>
<p>“Where do you think you’re going?”  She hissed, her lip curling in anger.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Rinoa stumbled backwards, having  been flung into the ground by a Death Claw. She remembered how easy it was to  dispatch them with her weapon but considering that she had nothing and had  forgotten to stock up on magic, she wasn’t faring too well. <em>Maybe they’re right…maybe I’m not fit for  fighting. I’m just a weak little girl who depends on others…</em>she said quietly as the Death Claw sliced at  her. <em>I want to see Squall again…</em>She stood up and summoned the strongest  spell to mind.</p>
<p><em>I want to see you again…</em></p>
<p>Squall felt it. They were close. He  just knew that Rinoa was close. He stopped and looked around.</p>
<p>“Hey, what’s wrong with you?” Irvine  asked. “Weren’t you the one scrambling to find Rinoa?” Squall said nothing. It  was still too foggy to see much. Centra was always like that. But he felt it in  his heart that he wasn’t to move. After a few moments, a figure in blue made  their way towards them, half dragging herself.</p>
<p>“RINOA!” Squall shouted. He ran past  all of them and embraced her tightly.</p>
<p>“Squall…it hurts…” She whimpered.  Squall let go immediately. She was scratched up in many places from her  encounter and weak.</p>
<p>“Rin!” Selphie almost tackled her  when Squall intercepted and stopped her. Selphie sighed and slumped her  shoulders.</p>
<p>“It’s really great to see you again!”  She yelped. “We thought we’d never see you again!”</p>
<p>“No we didn’t.” Squall said  dangerously. Selphie squeaked and moved away cautiously. Rinoa tugged on  Squall’s sleeve.</p>
<p>“I knew I could find you again…” She  whispered. Xu looked around but couldn’t see anyone else.</p>
<p>“Rinoa…where’s Quistis?” She asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah!” Zell agreed. “Where’s our  favorite instructor?”</p>
<p>“It was horrible…” Rinoa said  softly. “We were running through the dungeon that the Galbadians kept us in and  we ran into this freaky guy…he knocked Quistis unconscious with this beam of  light…he wanted to kill her! Squall I’m scared for her!”</p>
<p>“She’s not with you?” Selphie asked,  concerned. Rinoa shook her head and fell into Squall’s arms.</p>
<p>“Squall, you take Rinoa back to the  Ragnarok. I’m going to go search for Quistis. She’s got to be nearby.” Xu said,  walking away from them.</p>
<p>“Hey, Xu! Wait up!” Zell ran up to  her. “What’s the big hurry?”</p>
<p>“What’s the big hurry?!” Xu rounded  on him and he shrank. “Don’t you even care? Quistis could be out there dying  and you tell me not to worry?” She resumed her fast paced walking. Zell  slumped.</p>
<p>“She’s our friend too…” he mumbled  and then caught up with her. “You’re almost as frantic as Squall.” <em>You don’t know the half of it…</em>Xu thought bitterly as she trudged along.  “So, ah…Xu, how did you end up at Balamb Garden?” Xu said nothing. She didn’t  want to think about how she ended up there, how her mother used to mistreat  her, how her father had left her mother, meaning to take her with him but  failed in court. She didn’t want to think about it now.</p>
<p>“Zell, shut it.” She snapped,  feeling irritable. Zell quickly became quiet. There were so many emotions that  she was trying to keep under control right then. She feared, no feared was not  strong enough a word for the feeling that coursed through her body when she  thought that they might never find Quistis. She and Zell walked for some time,  Irvine, Selphie and Squall all too worried about Rinoa’s condition. <em>Some friends they are…</em>she thought angrily, wanting to pummel them,  to tell Quistis all about how they ran off to see how Rinoa was doing when she  was safely in Squall’s arms when Quistis could’ve been trapped somewhere and  dying…<em>dying…I hate that word…</em>She tried not to think about it. Except  Zell, who, even though was a bit of a buffoon at times, followed her, loyal to  his Instructor. He had almost a childish giddiness whenever he talked about how  cool Quistis was to all the Trepies. He admired her so much, respected her more  than the others did obviously. And quite suddenly, Xu felt ashamed. She knew  that the others cared as well, even Squall but perhaps they thought that Rinoa  was in more danger than Quistis. Maybe they had faith that she was going to be  alright, but that still didn’t erase the anger in her from knowing that either  way, they didn’t come along.</p>
<p>“Hey, what’s that?” Zell stopped  walking and pointed somewhere to their northwest. A man stumbled towards them  and Xu’s eyes widened when she saw that he had been horribly mangled and one of  his arms had been blown off and burned. His left eyes was missing and instead,  he was bleeding from the empty socket. “Oh man!” Zell yelled, running to him.  Xu stood, frozen to the spot, she knew something bad was going to happen.</p>
<p>“Zell! Get away from him!” She  yelled before she had time to think. Zell jumped away in surprise.</p>
<p>“What’s your problem? The man’s  hurt!”</p>
<p>“Witch…killed all of us…back…there…”  He whispered. “Unnatural…” He coughed and exploded. Zell gave a guttural noise  and backed away.</p>
<p>“What the hell was that?!” He  demanded. Xu walked towards the bloody mess carefully.</p>
<p>“He said something about a witch  over there. Do you think it could be Quistis?” He asked. Xu didn’t care. This  was as good a lead as any. She broke into a run. Something in the pit of her  stomach told her to go faster and she broke into a sprint. Even though she  fast, Zell caught up easily. “What’s the big idea?”</p>
<p>“I know she’s over there!” Xu  hissed. They ran until Xu could feel her lungs burning and she turned to look  at Zell. He promptly disappeared. She halted and looked down just in time to  see him roll down the rest of the stairs and collide with a wall.</p>
<p>“Mother f-ing…” he muttered, curling  up in a ball, holding his head tenderly. Xu walked down the steps.</p>
<p>“Come on.” She said, motioning  towards the open door.</p>
<p>“Oh sure…” Zell hissed, “I’m ok, no  need to worry.” The two walked in…</p>
<p>And into a nightmare. There were  bodies strewn all across the room, some impaled by ice spears that all too  resembled the ones that Edea used.</p>
<p>“Holy shit…” Zell cursed, taken  aback. Xu wasn’t looking at the bodies. She instead was focusing on the figure  that stood in the middle of the room, her eyes glowing black, shoulders slumped  like a raging beast.</p>
<p>“Quistis?” Xu whispered. The young  woman pitched forward, eyes closing. She gasped and dashed to catch her.  “Quistis!”</p>
<p>“Man oh man oh man!” Zell said, hopping  from one foot to the other. “I’m gonna go get Squall and the others!” He  disappeared out the door.</p>
<p>“Hey, Xu…” Quistis whispered. Her  eyes opened and they were normal again.</p>
<p>“What happened?!” Xu hissed.</p>
<p>“Xu…I want you to know  that…whatever…”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk now.” She ordered. “The  others will be here in a moment.”</p>
<p>“Rinoa?” Quistis asked. Xu scoffed.  That was the reason the others didn’t come. But she was still amazed that  Quistis could think of others at a time like this. That was part of her  personality though.</p>
<p>“She’s ok.” She replied. Quistis let  out a contented sigh and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>“Xu…I want you to know that…I still  love you.” Xu would’ve been overjoyed if not for the fact that Quistis had  stopped breathing.</p>
