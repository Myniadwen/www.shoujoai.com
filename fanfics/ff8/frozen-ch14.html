Quistis gave into the darkness as she prepared to step into oblivion.

&quot;don&#146;t, please...&quot; A choked whisper called to her. The sheer anguish in 
the voice caused Quistis to pause. She recognized the voice and 
shuttered hopelessly. She lowered her arms and sighed.

&quot;Why do you haunt me...&quot; Quistis cried in sorrow, not having the courage 
to turn around. She heard soft footsteps approaching.

&quot;PLEASE.&quot; Fujin said as gently as she could and sorely wished she could 
express herself better.

&quot;Fu?&quot; Quistis whimpered as she half glanced over her shoulder. Her wet 
hair hung over her eyes and her lips trembled with fear.

&quot;Is it really you.&quot; She shook visibly now as she slowly turned.

&quot;YES.&quot; Fujin breathed and offered a timid smile. Quistis stared in shock 
and back stepped. One foot dipped into thin air and she flailed to keep 
from falling.

&quot;NO!&quot; Fujin screamed in horror and lunged forward with an outstretched 
hand. Quistis caught her balance and moved clear from the edge. She 
clutched her chest terrified and crying.

Fujin stopped scant feet from her and stood nervously. She found herself 
shaking with a mix of fear and intense emotion. Quistis braced her hands 
on her knees and let out a deep breath.

&quot;What&#146;s wrong with me?&quot; She whispered to herself.

She ran her hands through her hair and slowly looked up at Fujin.

&quot;I&#146;ve missed you.&quot; She said simply her expression was one of weariness.&quot; 
Fujin stiffened and looked a but surprised at her words. She looked down 
awkwardly, her lips moved as if she wanted to say something. Quistis 
nodded to herself and sighed, surely Fujin didn&#146;t feel the same way.

&quot;Did she?&quot; Quistis wondered she looked up again. She saw how troubled 
Fujin was and frowned at herself.

&quot;I&#146;m a fool.&quot; She whispered to herself. Thunder exploded overhead and 
Fujin twitched visibly. It made Quistis recall the dream of finding her 
dying on the tracks leading to.. Esthar, she realized and went cold. She 
looked at the girl carefully and noted the wrapped ankle, the bruises 
and the angry sunburns. Quistis nearly cried at the sight of her.

&quot;Oh Fujin.&quot; She said sorrowfully. &quot;Where have you been?&quot; She reached for 
her and Fujin looked up wide-eyed. Quistis shrank back and looked 
pleadingly at her.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; She said worriedly. Fujin looked at her with a slight 
scowl and sniffed softly.

&quot;I&quot; She started then looked down not knowing what to say.

&quot;THOUGHT, LOST YOU.&quot; She shouted with a pained expression, her voice 
cracking.

Quistis&#146;s mouth hung open in surprise.

A painfully long moment passed as they stared at each other. The rain 
fell upon them in cool waves, washing away any semblance of denial. They 
both knew the truth&#146;s that lay between them, even it they dare not speak 
them aloud. Fujin looked down, her silvery hair draped over her face, 
hiding it in shadow. Quistis regarded the girl before her, she could 
tell how frightened and in turmoil she was.

&quot;Fu.&quot; She called to her softly.

Fujin turned her head so not to face her. She was trembling and unsure 
of what to do. Her mind and heart fought each other making her feel ill. 
She stole a nervous glance at Quistis, who stood just an arm&#146;s reach 
away. Quistis tilted her head slightly and gave her a welcome, soothing 
smile.

Fujin looked down again, growing flush under her gaze. Quistis took a 
careful step forward.

&quot;Fu.&quot; She said again softly, she so wanted to comfort the girl but 
didn&#146;t want to frighten her further. In an almost childlike gesture, 
Fujin wiped her eye with her palm then looked back up. Her face was taut 
with fear and she chewed her lower lip as she built up courage. Finally 
after an awkward moment she timidly walked forward.

She dared not meet the other woman&#146;s gaze for fear she&#146;d loose her 
nerve. Quistis smiled softly and welcomed her with open arms, hugging 
her close. Fujin laid her head against her chest and closed her eye. A 
shuttering sigh escaped her lips as she tentatively returned the 
embrace.

&quot;Shhh your okay hon.&quot; Quistis whispered into her hair as she held her, 
she could feel the girls shoulders shaking rhythmically. &quot;We both 
are...&quot;

They stood together in the rain for a long while comforting each other. 
Fujin finally broke the embrace and looked up with a stern expression.

&quot;FOOLISH.&quot; She said pouting and socked Quistis in the shoulder lightly. 
Quistis looked at her in shock then giggled faintly as she wiped her 
eyes. Fujin soured and punched her again.

&quot;SERIOUS!&quot; She scowled. &quot;SCARED ME.&quot; Her voice softened and shook looked 
hurt.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry Fu...&quot; Quistis whispered, feeling ashamed of her self for 
what she nearly did.

&quot;FUJIN.&quot; Fujin said still sulking.

&quot;Okay fair enough...Fujin.&quot; Quistis replied, trying not to smile at the 
face Fujin was making. Indignant pouting was not something she&#146;d ever 
seen on the girl.

Fujin huffed and walked back to the doorway leading off the roof. 
Quistis blinked in confusion and started after her.

&quot;Where are you going?&quot; She asked worried. Fujin knelt by the door the 
cooler she&#146;d left there. She walked back and offered it to her.

&quot;What&#146;s this?&quot; Quistis looked at the cooler then back at Fujin who stood 
silently. She opened it stared in surprise.

&quot;How?&quot; She slid the champagne bottle out of the ice.

&quot;HAPPY, BIRTHDAY.&quot; Fujin said simply.

&quot;This had to cost a... Wait a minute, how did you know it was my 
birthday?&quot; Quistis gave her a wary look.

&quot;FOLLOWED TODAY.&quot; Fujin said with a shrug and smirk.

&quot;Followed huh, I guess that&#146;s how you found me up here.&quot; Quistis said, 
blushing.

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot; Fujin gave her a shrew look and walked back to the door.

&quot;Where are you going now?&quot;

&quot;RAINING.&quot; Fujin stated flatly.

Fujin was back to form now that the emotional crisis had subsided. 
Quistis saw through it all and simply smiled at her.

&quot;You gonna help me drink this?&quot; Quistis shouted to her. Fujin paused 
then looked over her shoulder. She looked down a moment thinking before 
looking back at Quistis.

&quot;VERY WELL.&quot; She said bluntly and continued through the door. Quistis 
laughed softly and tucked the Champagne back in the cooler. She gave the 
edge of the roof a dark look then sighed heavily, before following her 
friend inside.</pre>
