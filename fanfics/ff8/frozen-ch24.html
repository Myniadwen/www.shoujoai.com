It took everything Quistis had to keep from giggling madly as they 
exited the shop. Fujin meanwhile slipped on the coat, bulky but 
functional and most importantly it was warm. She looked up at Quistis 
and smiled a gentle smile.

&quot;THANK YOU.&quot;

&quot;My pleasure hon.&quot; Quistis replied, still grinning ear from ear.

Together they walked silently out onto the wooden decks surrounding the 
resort. Snow crunched underfoot and the icy wind nipped at their ears. 
It was fairly quiet outside most of the patrons where far up on the 
slopes or indoors snuggling around cozy fires. Quistis enjoyed the peace 
and beauty of the place, with its snow capped peaks cloaked with tall 
elegant evergreens. And company most of all &#150;in her humble opinion- the 
company couldn&#146;t have been better. She thought back to Fujin sudden bit 
of odd possessiveness.

&quot;What was that about?&quot; She wondered. Fujin had been acting peculiar ever 
since arriving at the resort. Quistis regarded her for a second as they 
walked along. She had come cherish the time they spent together recently 
and was thankful for her friendship. Fujin, she knew had all but saved 
her life in so many ways.

&quot;Fu.&quot; She said softly and stopped walking.

Fujin turned to regard her, and Quistis noticed an odd but peaceful 
expression on her face.

&quot;You seem happy.&quot;

Fujin shrugged and tilted her head slightly in a manner Quistis found 
adorable.

&quot;I just wanted to thank you for coming with me. I know how much you 
dislike public places, but really wanted you to come. I hope you 
understand.&quot;

Fujin smiled an entrancing smile and Quistis saw something deep within 
her ruby hued gaze, something smoldering yet inviting. Quistis suddenly 
felt herself blushing and she exhaled softly.

&quot;I just wanted to say thank you.&quot; She said in a near whisper.

Fujin nodded in understanding and turned to continue walking, letting 
her gaze stay upon Quistis a brief moment longer before she did so.

*********************

&quot;I wonder why she took her?&quot; Rinoa said aloud as she sat in the floor 
brushing out Angelo&#146;s fur. The dog sat happily on it haunches, enjoying 
the attention. Squall sat on the edge of the bed sharpening his 
gunblade, something that was a nightly ritual since he got the cherished 
weapon.

&quot;Are you asking me?&quot; He said dully.

&quot;Well duh.&quot;

&quot;I dunno, perhaps because you guys have been poking in her business.&quot;

&quot;We have not.&quot; She said shocked.

&quot;You&#146;ve had Selphie follow and all but baby sit her.&quot;

&quot;We had a good reason she needed a friend.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;ve been nosy.&quot;

&quot;I have not.&quot;

&quot;You broke into her apartment.&quot;

&quot;Hey now, we thought she was hurt.&quot;

&quot;Whatever.&quot;

&quot;Still can&#146;t believe she took Fujin with her, of all people.&quot; Rinoa 
sighed.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s her choice.&quot;

&quot;It makes no sense.&quot;

&quot;Life is like that.&quot;

&quot;I hope she&#146;s not on drugs.&quot;

Squall rolled his eyes and nearly laughed.

&quot;You think this is funny.&quot;

&quot;Not at all.&quot;

&quot;I think that Fujin girl is a bad influence.&quot;

&quot;You sound like a parent.&quot;

&quot;Someone has to look out for her, she&#146;s our friend and she&#146;s acting like 
she doesn&#146;t want to have anything to do with us.&quot;

&quot;After how you guys treated Fujin, its little wonder why.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#146;t do anything.&quot;

&quot;Did you apologize to her like Nicole.&quot;

&quot;Not really.&quot;

&quot;See.&quot;

&quot;Hey now, since when do you take up for her I thought you hated her.&quot;

&quot;I never said that.&quot;

&quot;This is annoying.&quot;

&quot;Only because you let it be.&quot;

&quot;Are you not the least be curious as to what&#146;s going on.&quot;

&quot;Nope.&quot; He sheathed the blade and kicked off his boots.

&quot;Ugh men, you&#146;re all clueless.&quot;

&quot;Whatever.&quot;

Rinoa finished brushing Angelo and picked up the wads of fur lying 
about. She disposed of it and washed her hands, her demeanor flustered. 
Squall watched her and sighed.

&quot;Rinoa.&quot;

&quot;What.&quot; She snapped.

&quot;Quistis will be fine.&quot;

&quot;How can you be sure?&quot;

&quot;She&#146;s a grown woman for crying aloud. Older than you, I think she can 
take care of herself. As for Fujin she could use a friend, and so could 
Quistis.&quot;

&quot;We&#146;re her friends.&quot;

&quot;True but.&quot;

&quot;What buts.&quot;

&quot;She&#146;s always the odd one out that has to be awkward for her.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s not true.&quot;

&quot;Please.&quot; He scoffed.

&quot;You seem awfully enlightened where is all this insight coming from.&quot;

&quot;Common sense.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s insulting.&quot;

&quot;Sorry just stating a fact.&quot;

She slipped off her sandal and threw it at him.

************************

They stood atop one of the smaller slopes Quistis helping Fujin slip 
into her skis.

&quot;WILL DIE.&quot; Fujin said bluntly.

&quot;You will not.&quot; Quistis laughed brightly. &quot;Just do like we practiced on 
the bunny slope.&quot;

&quot;FOOLISH.&quot; Fujin grumbled sourly.

&quot;Everyone started out on the bunny slopes, it&#146;s alright. Personally, to 
be honest I&#146;d prefer if you practiced more before tackling an actual 
hill.&quot;

&quot;CHILDREN.&quot;

&quot;I know there was kids but everyone needs to start somewhere. Besides 
what&#146;s wrong with kids.&quot;

&quot;LOUD.&quot;

&quot;Some are, yes but that&#146;s hardly reason enough.&quot; Quistis argued as she 
donned her skis

&quot;SMELL.&quot;

&quot;They do not.&quot;

&quot;BABIES.&quot;

&quot;Okay you got me there but only sometimes.&quot;

&quot;IS ENOUGH.&quot;

&quot;Come now, does that mean you don&#146;t want kids someday.&quot;

&quot;UNABLE&quot; Fujin said without flinching as she slipped on her goggles. 
Quistis kicked herself relentlessly upon hearing her reply.

&quot;Oh Fu I&#146;m...&quot; She started, Fujin placed a gloved finger to her lips to 
silence her.

&quot;NOT YOUR FAULT.&quot; She said with a smile then kicked off the slope.

&quot;ACK FU WAIT FOR ME.&quot; Quistis shouted and shot off after her.

To her credit Fujin did remarkable well. That is until about half way 
down the slope. She wasn&#146;t exactly sure why but she soon found herself 
airborne and flailing. She gritted her teeth in grim anticipation as she 
flew headfirst towards a tree. By the grace of whatever guardian angel 
she had, she missed the trunk by inches and instead plowed headlong 
through brush, before finally tumbled haphazardly into a snow bank.

&quot;FUJIN!&quot; Quistis yelled in fright as she skidded to a stop by the 
underbrush.

&quot;ANNOYANCE.&quot; Fujin said sharply amid a torrent of curses. Quistis made 
her way through the underbrush in search of her. She found a ski and the 
poles first then finally found her. Fujin lay tangled upside down half 
buried in the snow. One leg sticking straight into the air propped up by 
her remaining ski.

&quot;Hyne! Are you okay hon, that was some spill?&quot; Quistis worried as she 
rushed to her side.

&quot;FINE.&quot; Fujin grumbled.

&quot;Be careful don&#146;t hurt yourself.&quot;

&quot;STUPID.&quot;

Quistis was going to say -I told you so- but decided against it. She 
helped her to her feet and brushed the snow from her hair carefully.

&quot;You&#146;re just new at it is all.&quot;

Fujin clomped through the snow angrily in search of her missing ski. 
Quistis followed discreetly behind her.

&quot;You want to head in get something to eat and try again bright and early 
tomorrow?&quot;

Fujin recovered her ski and clamped it on then looked up with a huff. 
She hated failing but knew trying to do anything while angry just made 
it harder.

&quot;VERY WELL.&quot;

Quistis draped her arm over her shoulders to console her.

&quot;It&#146;s okay, don&#146;t worry about it, at least you&#146;re okay. I broke my 
shoulder just trying walk in skis when I first tried it.&quot; Quistis said 
with a smirk. Fujin looked at her in surprise.

&quot;WALKING?&quot;

&quot;Sure did, felt like a idiot too.&quot;

&quot;APOLOGY.&quot;

&quot;Live and learn.&quot; Quistis winked. &quot;Think you&#146;re ready to go down the 
rest of the way?&quot;

Fujin tested her skis and nodded.

&quot;Right then, we&#146;ll take it easy then.&quot;

Fujin sighed in aggravation but did as she was told.

 

They arrived back at their room well after dark. They had stayed at the 
restaurant far longer they intended, the band that had been playing 
there was far better than either of them expected. Quistis yawned cutely 
as she fumbled with the keys. Fujin stood half buried under the hood of 
her coat waiting patiently.

&quot;All things considered I think we had fun?&quot; Quistis said brightly.

Fujin nodded and then made a scrunched up face before sneezing.

&quot;Bless you, you&#146;d better not be catching a cold.&quot; Quistis scolded as she 
unlocked the door and entered. Fujin rolled her eye and followed her 
inside. They hung their coats by the door and Quistis pulled the pin 
holding up her hair and shook it out.

&quot;You can take first dibs on the shower if you want, I&#146;m going to finish 
unpacking.&quot;

Fujin didn&#146;t argue as she sat on the bed and kicked off her boots. She 
felt a bit uneasy as she looked around; she&#146;d never liked staying in 
hotels and such. Dismissing her feelings she pulled off her sweater and 
head to the bathroom. Quistis toiled about pulling clothes out of 
suitcases and settling them neatly into drawers.

&quot;I&#146;ve changed.&quot; Fujin thought as she gazed at the stranger in the 
mirror.

&quot;For the better though.&quot; She reasoned. &quot;Because of her.&quot;

She sighed and hung her head a moment. A soft exhale escaped her lips 
and she slowly looked up in the mirror again. She knew her feeling, she 
could admit that to herself now, but she was still afraid. Afraid of 
failure, afraid of disappointment, afraid of everything it seemed. She 
sighed heavily and ran her fingers roughly through her hair. She had to 
do something soon or she felt she would go mad.

*

Fujin exited the bathroom wrapped in a dark blue towel her hair, still 
damp, hung heavily along her pale shoulders.

&quot;Enjoy the shower?&quot; Quistis said smilingly as she finished the last of 
the unpacking. Fujin nodded quietly. There was an air about her Quistis 
noticed; she seemed almost timid in her movements as she sat on the bed 
to dry her hair, her gaze downcast and solemn.

&quot;You feeling okay hon?&quot; Quistis asked softly.

Fujin looked up almost shyly and smiled thin but cute smile. Quistis 
looked at her with caring eyes.

&quot;You seemed upset for a moment.&quot;

Fujin shook her head slowly.

&quot;Kay then. It&#146;s my turn to hit the shower. Be right back.&quot;

*

Quistis shut the door quietly as she stepped into the bathroom. 
Something was different in the air between them. Quistis smiled softly 
at the implications of it though she didn&#146;t know what to expect. She 
resigned herself to accept it what the future held for them, no matter 
what.

*

As she exited the bathroom she noticed the lights were off and the only 
illumination came from the warm radiance of the fireplace that was 
nestled just a few feet from bed. The flames leapt and danced warmly, 
fed from gas pumped through artificial logs. Quistis toyed with the belt 
of her robe as she made her way further into the room. She paused as she 
saw Fujin draped in a bedspread and sitting quietly and staring into the 
fire. She tilted her head curiously and made her way to Fujin&#146;s side.

&quot;Fu?&quot; She whispered softly as she sat carefully beside her.

Fujin turned her head to face her, the flickering light causing shadows 
to dance across her face. She wore a frightened yet sad expression, her 
eye wide and her lips trembling. Quistis&#146;s heart broke at torment she 
saw in her face.

&quot;Fu what&#146;s wrong honey, talk to me, please.&quot; Quistis pleaded gently.

Fujin wiped her eye with her palm and then chewed her thumbnail 
self-consciously.

Quistis, nearly in tears pulled her to her, hugging her close to her 
chest. Fujin responded immediately and returned the embrace tightly. 
Quistis was at a loss and simply held her as she whispered soothing 
words to calm her. Fujin&#146;s heart pounded in her chest threatening to 
explode, it was all she could do to just hold her tight. After a long 
moment Fujin began to calm down. She sniffed lightly and Quistis looked 
down at her with dusky eyes.

&quot;It&#146;s okay.&quot; She whispered as she lifted the trembling girls chin with a 
delicate hand.

Fujin looked up slowly, her gaze intense and soulful but still fearful. 
Quistis gave her a reassuring smile as she caressed her cheek, Fujin&#146;s 
heart melted at the touch. They stared quietly into each other&#146;s eyes, 
searching, hoping, and praying, for understanding, trust, compassion and 
more. Fujin pressed her cheek against Quistis&#146;s soft caress and sighed 
softly, her lips parting invitingly. Quistis&#146;s heart joined Fujin&#146;s in 
it&#146;s frantic beating as she leaned closer. Fujin closed her eye and 
trembled deliciously as Quistis&#146;s lips met hers with loving 
gentleness... </pre>
