<h1>Everybody Else's Girl (part 2 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff8/index.html">Final Fantasy  8</a>

<a href="../ff8/everygirl-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Hey, are you waiting for someone?&quot;

Xu looked up, though not very far. The SeeD who had asked the question 
was looking up at her, an eager-to-please expression on his young face, 
and Xu knew instantly that he&#39;d just put on the uniform ten minutes ago. 
He was obviously still washed away in the combined waves of awe, 
overwhelming pride, and mortal terror. He was sixteen, Xu assumed - a 
little younger than average, for a new SeeD, but certainly not unheard 
of. Xu herself had made SeeD at sixteen.

&quot;I&#39;m just asking &#39;cause the ball&#39;s already started, and...&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Xu replied, her professional SeeD smile on her face. &quot;I&#39;m 
fine.&quot;

He nodded nervously, and then ducked away: she watched him walk quickly 
into the ballroom, and wondered for a moment why she wasn&#39;t doing the 
same.

Hey, am I waiting for someone?

&quot;Xu!&quot;

And there was Quistis, her uniform immaculate - of course it was, she&#39;d 
never worn it before.

Xu smiled, a much more sincere smile than she&#39;d given the other SeeD, 
and raised her hand. &quot;Hello, Quistis,&quot; she said, walking towards her. 
They were used to each other&#39;s first names by now: Instructor Lan had 
recovered much faster than Dr. Kadowaki had expected, and relieved Xu of 
her relief position, teaching the SeeD cadets himself from the great 
wisdom that had gotten him hospitalised. Quistis sometimes quietly 
admitted to Xu, during their games of Triple Triad, that she&#39;d much 
rather Xu had taken the position permanently. Xu had laughed, and said 
that she&#39;d rather not deal with Almasy&#39;s private war with Leonhart for 
another few years.

Almasy had been even more intolerable than usual that day. The moment 
he&#39;d heard that Quistis was attempting the field exam, he&#39;d signed up 
for testing himself. He&#39;d never admitted why, but Xu thought she knew - 
there was no way he&#39;d let any member of his class outdo him, no way he&#39;d 
let Quistis become SeeD before he did. Xu was a little ashamed of the 
satisfaction she&#39;d felt when Seifer had failed, but she couldn&#39;t deny 
that she&#39;d felt it.

Besides, it barely brought her a fraction of the satisfaction - and, she 
admitted, joy as well - she&#39;d felt on hearing that Quistis had become 
SeeD. As young as any SeeD who qualified to take the exam, and she&#39;d 
made it. Xu, for all her happiness, was barely surprised at all.

Quistis didn&#39;t hug her. Xu had only been her friend for half a year, but 
that had been long enough to realise that Quistis was never anything but 
decorous, even with her closest friends: speech always perfect, clothes 
always perfect, even down to her precise laugh. Xu accepted that as a 
part of her friend&#39;s personality, but secretly, her greatest joys were 
the moments where Quistis laughed a little too hard, or said something 
beyond &quot;Goodness&quot;... seeing Quistis as Quistis, rather than Trepe, the 
SeeD Rank 8 the world expected.

Of course, Xu reflected, a lot of it isn&#39;t really an act... but she&#39;s 
still being who everybody else wants her to be.

&quot;Shall we go in?&quot; she asked, offering Quistis her hand.

Quistis took it, and it was only the moment they passed through the 
double-doors that Xu realised: she was walking into a ball with Quistis 
on her arm. The implication was something she hadn&#39;t even considered 
before, but in the brief few seconds before Quistis&#39; classmates 
approached her, she wondered if it pleased her or not.

Xu didn&#39;t know the first few by faces, nor did she really notice the 
streams of compliments they paid her (for a moment, she wondered if the 
last boy had really muttered &quot;of course, you&#39;re all just playing into my 
hands&quot; after his one-sentence congratulations, but put it out of her 
mind). The last two, on the other hand...

Leonhart had said, simply, &quot;Good work&quot;, and then turned away before 
Quistis could thank him.

Almasy was more complicated. His expression was a war between two 
emotions, struggling so fiercely that Xu could make out neither. In the 
end, he said &quot;Leonhart said it. You passed,&quot; and turned away himself, in 
a different direction. His words were civil - if barely - but his tone 
made it a considered insult. In a brief moment of anger, Xu almost 
lunged after him. Quistis laid a hand on her arm, just a quiet touch, 
and Xu realised that she might have been closer to making that lunge 
than she&#39;d thought.

She also realised that, implications or not, she enjoyed having Quistis&#39; 
hand on her arm.

Before she knew she was doing it, she was considering asking Quistis to 
dance. After all, Quistis was one of four SeeDs who had graduated, one 
of four SeeDs this ball celebrated. Before the night was over, she&#39;d 
likely be asked to dance ten or more times, and why shouldn&#39;t one of 
those invitations come from her closest friend? She&#39;d taught Quistis to 
dance, was it so strange that she should ask her to demonstrate the 
skills she&#39;d learnt, just once?

She wondered, for a moment, how Quistis would react. For a SeeD to dance 
with a partner of the same sex wasn&#39;t expressly forbidden at SeeD balls, 
but it never happened - custom would look down on it, and the dancers 
would likely receive stern censures from Garden Faculty members with 
their faces concealed in the shadows of their hats. Even though it 
wasn&#39;t what everyone else expected, what everyone else wanted, might 
Quistis agree to dance?

&quot;Certainly,&quot; Quistis said, with a smile, and Xu looked at her with some 
shock.

While she had been trying to justify asking Quistis to dance, a boy she 
hadn&#39;t noticed had offered his hand, and always-professional Quistis had 
accepted it. She smiled to Xu for a moment, and then walked with him 
onto the dance floor, and Xu tried to persuade herself that the sick, 
angry feeling rising in her stomach wasn&#39;t jealousy. But if not 
jealousy... then what?

Without thinking about it, she took a flute of Garden-function champagne 
from the hired caterer, and watched Quistis dance.

Of course, she did it perfectly. That was no surprise at all. When Xu 
had been teaching her, she had stumbled, and tripped, and occasionally 
giggled a great deal over a wrong step, but before she had ever tried to 
dance in public, she&#39;d practiced until she was perfect. She had a 
natural grace, too, that made her seem like she was dancing even when 
she walked, and made her deadly with her whip. She was a credit to SeeD 
in all things, and watching her, Xu felt a strange sense of pride rise 
to join the other feeling not jealousy not jealousy not jealousy at all.

And then Quistis and her barely-noticeable partner took a step to the 
right, and Xu found her eyes locked with Seifer Almasy.

When he noticed her, he looked back, challenge easily visible in his 
eyes... and in the end, it was Xu who had to look away. He almost 
smirked at that, and then turned back to his conversation. A short 
grey-haired girl and a large dark skinned boy were hanging on to his 
every word. Xu had seen neither of them around Garden, and both were 
very noticeable.

Maybe it was the champagne, though Xu had been drinking the occasional 
social glass of wine for two years now and certainly didn&#39;t get even 
slightly drunk on one glass of Garden-function champagne. Maybe it was 
Almasy&#39;s arrogance, the self-importance that she&#39;d dealt with for her 
entire term as relief Instructor. Maybe it was because she hadn&#39;t asked 
Quistis to dance. At any rate, she set down her half-empty glass of 
champagne, and walked purposefully around the dance floor to where 
Almasy and his posse stood.

&quot;Instructor,&quot; he said, upon seeing her. The title certainly had no 
respect in it; quite the opposite, it was a challenge.

&quot;Not any more, Cadet Almasy,&quot; Xu responded. The girl and the boy were 
looking at her - a moment of shock, as Xu realised the girl only had one 
eye - and Xu started to feel that it had been a bad idea to bother with 
Seifer, over such a tiny thing. But she was committed now. &quot;Why did you 
speak as you did to SeeD Trepe?&quot;

Almasy seemed to take a moment to remember, and Xu knew that this was a 
stupid thing to get angry over... but she was. When he spoke, it was 
with the same challenge, the same arrogance, the same barely-repressed 
anger, as flowed through everything he did. &quot;Was that a problem, 
Instructor?&quot; She considered reminding him that she wasn&#39;t Instructor, 
but that was undoubtedly what he wanted. &quot;She passed, and that&#39;s all I 
said.&quot;

&quot;Do you resent SeeD Trepe?&quot; She used all the cold, dispassionate 
non-feeling she could put into her voice - SeeDs were occasionally 
required to be interrogaters, and Xu had done very well at that.

&quot;Why would I resent Trepe, Instructor? I have four more years to become 
SeeD.&quot;

But you wanted to be first, you arrogant ass, and it shows. &quot;No reason. 
Carry on, Cadet Almasy.&quot; She stalked away, then, and used the best of 
her patience to pretend she didn&#39;t hear what Almasy was saying to his 
posse about her.

The music came to a finish, with a few brief violin strings, and the 
audience applauded. Xu picked up her glass, and watched the dancers 
disperse, feeling the sick knot of not jealousy disperse as Quistis took 
a flute of champagne and came to her, her perfectly straight stance 
seeming to be at odds with her genuine smile. Quistis&#39; smile, not SeeD 
Rank 8 Trepe&#39;s.

&quot;Xu?&quot; she said, a half-question that served as the prelude to a real 
one.

&quot;Yes, Quistis?&quot; Xu replied.

&quot;Can I have our picture taken?&quot;

It was such an unexpected request that for a moment Xu had no response, 
and Quistis took that moment to give her explanation. &quot;Tomorrow I have 
my first mission. Three other SeeDs and I are tracking down Galbadian 
deserters in FH. SeeD aren&#39;t particularly welcome there, so the mission 
may go on for some time...&quot; she smiles so sweetly, Xu thought, 
disjointed, even when she&#39;s nervous... &quot;and you&#39;re my best friend here, 
and I&#39;ll miss you. I&#39;d like to have a photo of us.&quot;

Xu still paused, for a moment, just to work out whether Quistis meant... 
anything besides what she had said. Quistis&#39; expression seemed just 
about to change, the smile about to give way to something else, and that 
finished Xu&#39;s decision for her. &quot;Certainly, Quistis,&quot; she said.

Quistis - or maybe SeeD Rank 8 Trepe - did a very good job of hiding her 
emotions, but Xu still saw the relief and happiness in her expression, 
and wondered why it touched her so strongly.

They posed together for the photographers, and when Quistis stood a 
little too close to Xu for the kind of photograph she&#39;d mentioned, Xu 
noticed, and found herself surprised that it made her glad.</pre>
