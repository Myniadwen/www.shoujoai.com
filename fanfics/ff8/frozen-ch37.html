you.



School Daze

 

&quot;You should say something.&quot; Nicole said softly.

&quot;No.&quot; Rinoa frowned and took a bite of her eggs.

&quot;Come on this mess has gone on enough. Let&#39;s just let bygones be 
bygones.&quot;

&quot;Nikki&#39;s right Rinoa, we&#39;re all tired of this even, Selphie let it go.&quot; 
Irvine added as he guzzled down his orange juice.

&quot;I didn&#39;t let anything go thank you very much. I&#39;ve just decided to 
ignore her.&quot; Selphie snapped as she mixed salt and pepper into a tall 
glass of buttermilk. Without so much as a second thought she promptly 
downed the concoction.

&quot;Gross.&quot; Rinoa winced.

&quot;Oh hush.&quot; Selphie stuck her now pasty white tongue out at her.

&quot;Egad woman!&quot; Irvine poked her.

&quot;How can you drink that.&quot; Squall balked

&quot;Zell...&quot; Nicole sighed, rolling her eyes at Zell whom was blissfully 
grossed in devouring cinnamon rolls.

&quot;It&#39;s good.&quot; He and Selphie argued in unison.

&quot;I think you are both retarded.&quot; Celest added dryly under her breath, 
earning an unpleasant look from Selphie.

&quot;I still think you should at least say something to Quistis then.&quot; 
Nicole sighed looking over to where Quistis and Fujin sat quietly 
eating. &quot;It&#39;s been two days now.&quot;

&quot;No, she&#39;s made her choices I guess we&#39;re not good enough.&quot; Rinoa 
pouted.

Nicole looked pleadingly to Squall for his assistance. He promptly 
shrugged, having chosen not to get involved anymore than he had. So long 
as the brawling had ceased he was content to let sleeping dogs lie.

&quot;This -is- getting ridiculous ladies.&quot; Irvine piped up.

&quot;I still don&#39;t see what all the hoopla is about myself.&quot; Celest said 
glancing over to the duo sitting apart from them. &quot;I mean that Fujin gal 
seems quiet enough, surely she&#39;s not -that- bad. We&#39;ve all have done 
things we regret right. Hyne knows I have.&quot; She said, adding the last 
part under her breath.

&quot;Celest is right.&quot; Zell said with a mouthful of food and gesturing at 
Rinoa with his fork.

&quot;I&#39;m not changing my mind.&quot; Rinoa said with snobbishly polite tone while 
poking absently about her plate.

&quot;Oh well I tried.&quot; He shrugged and went back to wolfing down his 
breakfast.

&quot;You two are like sisters.&quot; Nicole tried in vain.

&quot;Was.&quot; Rinoa pointed out bluntly.

&quot;Enough, this is giving me a headache.&quot; Squall frowned rubbing his 
temple.

&quot;Hey boss come down to the dojo after breakfast I have some stuff to go 
over with you.&quot; Zell said with a noticeably silly grin.

&quot;Alright then.&quot; Squall nodded and stood.

&quot;Where are you off to?&quot; Rinoa looked up curiously.

&quot;I have to take care of Flyboy&#39;s request to get his wings back.&quot; Squall 
gestured to Zell who was nearly bouncing in excitement.

&quot;Great won&#39;t see him for months.&quot; Nicole frowned sarcastically.

&quot;I told you, you can come with.&quot; Zell said defensively.

Nicole folded her arms and frowned.

&quot;I hate flying, besides that thing gives me the creeps, I swear it 
watches me.&quot;

Irvine perked up and smiled slyly.

&quot;Ya know they say the Ragnarock&#39;s a ghost ship, and that some of the 
people Adel killed haunt it.&quot;

Selphie&#39;s eyes twinkled mischievously.

&quot;Oh yeah I heard about that, they say it&#39;s possessed and it feeds off 
the fearful. Squall and Rinoa can tell you, they fought ghosts aboard 
it.&quot;

&quot;They where monsters from the lunar cry.&quot; Squall said dully.

&quot;Liar.&quot; Nicole scoffed and bounced a biscuit off Irvine&#39;s forehead. 
Celest and Selphie burst into laughter at him.

&quot;Ladies please, a modicum of respect.&quot; Irvine protested.

Shaking his head Squall left without a word. Rinoa watched him 
thoughtfully before looking back to the others.

&quot;He&#39;s in a good mood today.&quot; Celest noted.

&quot;That&#146;s just his way.&quot; Rinoa sighed.

&quot;So you&#39;re not going to say anything then?&quot; Nicole frowned.

&quot;Nope.&quot; Rinoa responded with singular resolve.

&quot;I don&#39;t blame her.&quot; Selphie added.

&quot;Man you girls can be ruthless.&quot; Zell frowned and stretched his arms 
over his head. &quot;Well I&#39;ve gotta go teach the newbies see ya round.&quot;

&quot;Not so fast.&quot; Nicole smirked and pulled him into a light kiss.

&quot;Seems everyone&#39;s got someone around here but me.&quot; Celest pouted.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry sis you take after me, give em time and they will come 
knocking.&quot; Irvine beamed proudly. His grin was short lived as Selphie 
smashed his foot with her heel.

&quot;GAH, what was that about!?&quot;

&quot;I positively have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.&quot; Selphie giggled.

&quot;See you guys, stay out of trouble.&quot; Zell chuckled as he wiggled from 
Nicole&#39;s grip.

Everyone said farewell as he too hurried out of the cafeteria.

&quot;Well.&quot; Selphie smirked, eyeing Nicole with suspicion.

&quot;Well what?&quot; Nicole fluttered.

&quot;Oh come off it.&quot; Rinoa snapped impatiently

&quot;Your birthday is coming up surely you know by now?&quot; Celest chimed in.

Nicole sighed and pushed her plate away.

&quot;I think he forgot.&quot;

&quot;Yikes.&quot; Irvine nearly coughed up his drink.

&quot;That&#146;s bad.&quot; Celest frowned.

&quot;Surely he&#39;ll come through, I mean come on you&#39;ve been dating for more 
than a year.&quot; Selphie pointed out in an attempt to dissuade her fears.

&quot;Zell&#39;s the man, he&#39;ll come through.&quot; Irvine added.

&quot;I dunno.&quot; Nicole mumbled.

**********************

&quot;APOLOGY.&quot; Fujin said as she stared absently at her plate.

&quot;Whatever for?&quot; Quistis looked puzzled.

Fujin nodded towards where Rinoa and friends sat chatting.

&quot;DISRUPTING FRIENDSHIP.&quot;

&quot;Piffle.&quot; Quistis scoffed at the notion.

&quot;NEED FRIENDS.&quot;

&quot;If they can&#39;t accept you as my friend I can only imagine what they&#39;d 
say if they knew the truth. I&#39;m not going to let them worry me, if they 
want to be hardheaded I can too. I choose to stand by you, to be with 
you and nothing will change that.&quot;

&quot;TOOK CHANCE.&quot; Fujin frowned at her.

&quot;Yes and I&#39;m glad I did. You&#39;re very dear to me. Never think otherwise.&quot;

Fujin speared an apple slice from her plate and chewed it slowly. A look 
of concern crossed her pale features.

&quot;It&#39;ll be okay hon.&quot; Quistis patted her thigh and smiled.

&quot;PERHAPS.&quot;

&quot;Come on love, no doom and gloom.&quot;

&quot;I AM FINE.&quot;

&quot;Affirmative.&quot; Quistis winked.

&quot;FLIRT.&quot; Fujin chuckled.

&quot;Like you&#39;re any better.

&quot;Hi Miss Trepe, Miss Fujin.&quot; Royce said shyly as he walked up, plate in 
hand.

&quot;Hi Royce, you ready for class.&quot; Quistis smiled and bid him to sit. 
Fujin gave him a cursory glance and quietly resumed eating.

&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am.&quot; He smiled brightly and sat down.

&quot;How&#39;s Aeka doing I didn&#39;t get to see her yesterday? It&#39;s been two days 
now surely she can return to class?&quot; Quistis asked curiously.

&quot;Well Doc says she can resume class today actually, she kept her last 
night just to be sure she was well rested apparently she hasn&#39;t been 
sleeping good.&quot;

&quot;Why on earth not?&quot; Quistis frowned.

&quot;TRAUMA?&quot; Fujin said mildly.

&quot;No this is a constant thing with her, she stays up late studying all 
the time.&quot; Royce shrugged. &quot;Typical workaholic syndrome.&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#39;t surprise me in the least.&quot; Quistis shook her head.

&quot;So Miss Fujin?&quot; Royce looked at her with a sly grin. &quot;How are you 
liking class?&quot;

&quot;TEDIOUS.&quot; Fujin answered with the subtly of a runaway dump truck. 
Quistis elbowed her in the ribs and made a face.

&quot;Hey now!&quot;

Fujin grumbled and shot her a cool look.

&quot;ENTERTAINING.&quot; She corrected.

Royce laughed lightly.

&quot;Well we&#39;re glad to have someone who knows the ropes in class. Who knows 
perhaps we can get you a membership in the Treppies.&quot; He said with 
absurd seriousness. Fujin blinked and sat befuddled. Quistis erupted 
into laughter at the very notion of such a thing.

&quot;What?&quot; Royce arched a brow and had the feeling he was missing 
something.

&quot;Ya know Royce usually I try to frown on all the fan club business. 
Quistis looked thoughtfully.

&quot;I know, I know, you think it makes you look haughty.&quot; Royce droned as 
if he&#39;d heard the argument before.

&quot;Yeah well, this time I think you&#39;re right.&quot; She smiled toothy smile.

&quot;Really!&quot; Royce beamed.

&quot;Yes I do.&quot; Quistis put an arm around Fujin&#39;s shoulder and shook her in 
an overbearingly friendly gesture. Fujin looked at her as if she&#39;d gone 
mad.

&quot;Fujin would be a great addition to your club, it would help her feel 
more welcome in the class.&quot; She chuckled mischievously. Fujin&#39;s eye went 
wide in bewilderment.

&quot;PROTEST.&quot; She blurted and looked at Royce with near fear on her face.

&quot;Oh come now I know you&#39;re shy and all but it&#39;ll be fun.&quot; Quistis 
smirked.

&quot;Yeah great idea.&quot; Royce nodded.

&quot;FOOLISHNESS.&quot; Fujin stammered.

&quot;Oh....&quot; Quistis softly and let her go. &quot;I understand.&quot;

&quot;WHAT, I, WAIT!?&quot; Fujin looked back and forth to Royce and Quistis.

&quot;No, no, It&#39;s okay, you don&#39;t like me or my class.&quot; Quistis sniffled and 
tried to smile. It took all of Royce&#39;s power not to burst out in 
laughter. If he hadn&#39;t seen it with his own eyes he&#39;d never believe 
Fujin falling for such a simple thing as a guilt trip.

&quot;MISUNDERSTAND.&quot; Fujin tried and glared at Royce who shrank back in his 
seat under her ember gaze.

&quot;YOU!&quot; She spat sourly.

&quot;Me!?&quot; He swallowed.

&quot;CARD!&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;NOW!&quot; Fujin tapped the tabletop in annoyance as Quistis hitched and 
sighed heavily.

&quot;Oh yeah...sorry.&quot; Royce fumbled about in his pocket and withdrew a 
small camera.

&quot;WHAT!&quot; Fujin stiffened.

&quot;They have member pictures on them.&quot; Royce said stiffly.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin protested vehemently.

Quistis leaned over grabbing Fujin and pressed against her cheek to 
cheek.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t be such a baby, go ahead Royce.&quot; She giggled and smiled like a 
fool.

&quot;If you say so.&quot; Royce shrugged and quickly snapped the picture. Fujin 
was not caught at her best, caught in an expression of shock and 
annoyance.

&quot;Um I think I&#39;m done with breakfast.&quot; Royce said quickly and rushed off.

&quot;HEY!&quot; Fujin yelled as Quistis smiled brightly.

&quot;I&#39;ll have the card ready later in class.&quot; Royce called once safely 
away.

&quot;That&#146;s was sweet of you.&quot; Quistis said laughingly.

&quot;DIRTY.&quot; Fujin sulked.

&quot;Oh come now.&quot;

&quot;HUMPF!&quot;

&quot;Oh so you&#39;re not my biggest fan then?&quot;

&quot;DID NOT SAY THAT.&quot;

&quot;Well what&#39;s the problem then.&quot; Quistis eyed her shrewdly.

&quot;I...&quot; Fujin felt cornered by the whole mess and she knew Quistis loved 
every minute of it.

&quot;MINX!&quot; She hissed under her breath.

&quot;Love you too.&quot; Quistis whispered back, taking a peaceful sip from her 
drink.

********************

Zell&#39;s students where busily going their morning exercises when Squall 
approached the dojo. Zell had been keeping an eye on the door and ran 
over to him eagerly.

&quot;Well how&#39;d it go, did I get my flight clearance back.&quot; Zell grinned 
hopefully.

&quot;He said no.&quot; Squall said simply.

&quot;Darn it that means I&#39;m grounded for the rest of the month. Well I guess 
you&#39;re doing the flying then old pal.&quot; He clapped Squall on the shoulder 
and smiled.

&quot;Are you sure you still want to do this, its not going to be easy.&quot;

&quot;Oh you worry to much think of it as a little vacation.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never been on vacation.&quot; Squall said in his patented dull tone. 
Zell made a sour face and nodded.

&quot;Ya know, I actually believe that coming from you...&quot;

Squall ignored the comment and folded his arms thoughtfully.

&quot;So then, this thing?&quot; He paused trying to remember.

&quot;Pseudo Dragon.&quot; Zell offered.

&quot;Suedoo Dragon?&quot;

&quot;Close enough.

&quot;How will we even know where to look once we get there?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been reading up on them.&quot;

&quot;Alright then but are you sure it&#39;s a good idea to bring a wild animal 
home to your girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah it&#39;s cool they are smart and love people, hell the Cetra used 
to keep em as pets.&quot;

&quot;Seems like bad idea to me. An old superstition claims that things 
coming from that island are damned.&quot;

&quot;Since when did you become superstitious.&quot; Zell nearly laughed in his 
face.

&quot;I&#39;m not, just letting you know this could get ugly.&quot;

&quot;You forget man we&#39;ve been there, we can handle it.&quot;

&quot;Alright then, if you&#39;re sure. I&#39;m bringing Ifrit and Shiva with me, 
just in case.&quot; He&#39;d been through too much to risk going half cocked to 
some godforsaken place like the islands without a guardians.

&quot;You worry to much, you going to start sounding like Miss Trepe.&quot; Zell 
chided.

&quot;Whatever.&quot;

&quot;I guess I&#39;ll bring the boys then.&quot; Zell smiled mischievously, Squall 
bristled at the mere mention of the sibling Guardian Forces Zell 
referred to.

&quot;You keep those two in the umbra unless we get in a fight!&quot; He snapped 
abruptly.

&quot;Oh calm down.&quot; Zell laughed.

&quot;I&#39;m serious those two nearly killed me last time.&quot;

&quot;Oh that&#146;s just Minotaur &#39;s way, he likes you and Sacred is just 
playful.&quot; Zell tried in vain to reassure his friend. He failed 
miserably.

&quot;Just keep them away from me.&quot; Squall sputtered trying to keep his cool.

&quot;Fine, fine, how about Pandemonia, he can help clear a trail.&quot;

&quot;No it&#39;s moody, besides I think Quistis returned it to Fujin.&quot;

&quot;Aw hell and I was going to try and win him over.&quot;

&quot;Just take Quezacotl or Cerberus and stop being difficult.&quot;

&quot;Man you&#39;re no fun lately.&quot; Zell sulked in defeat.

Squall gave him a caustic look

&quot;Just be ready tomorrow evening.&quot; He said with a bit of finality and 
walked away.

&quot;No problem, thanks again boss.&quot; Zell called before turning his 
attention back to his class. Luccian and Archibald stood waiting 
patiently before him.

&quot;Where&#39;d you two come from?&quot; Zell said with a start.

&quot;I&#39;m heading home for a few weeks to take care of some family affairs.&quot; 
Luccian said simply earning a look of confusion from Archibald.

&quot;Heh time to fill the coffers again eh?&quot; Zell smirked.

&quot;Something like that.&quot; Luccian smirked back dryly.

&quot;Archibald will be coming with me.&quot; He added, once again earning a look 
from his companion.

&quot;Why?&quot; Zell felt something was up but couldn&#39;t figure out what.

&quot;He&#39;ll be working as head of security at my families business after we 
graduate so he needs to be indoctrinated in some of the routines.&quot; 
Luccian said smoothly with a glimmer in his eye.

&quot;Hey cool.&quot; Archibald smiled hugely showing teeth that seemed 
uncomfortably larger than needed. Luccian took a breath to calm the urge 
he felt to smack his friend about the head.

&quot;Yeah okay whatever, it&#39;s not up to me ya gotta go talk to Cid. Thanks 
for letting me know though.&quot;

&quot;No problem.&quot; Luccian smiled slowly. &quot;So what&#39;s on the agenda today 
teach?&quot;

*****************************

The somewhat outdated film projector prattled noisily as it showed its 
offering onto the screen before it. Quistis had decided to show 
recordings of formers students in battle using Guardian Forces. The 
problem with filming the beings was that the vast majority of them used 
attacks that assaulted the victims on a level not picked up by mortal 
senses. Being creatures of energy their attacks resisted normal 
classification and defied the very laws of nature. They had a nasty 
tendency rip reality asunder and inject their own spin on things. While 
terribly disorienting and damaging to the unlucky soul targeted, the 
effects made little to no impact on things that where not directly 
involved.

&quot;Kind of a pity though.&quot; Quistis thought sadly, for unless you are 
working with, or Hyne forbid the target of a Guardian&#39;s fury, you never 
could appreciate awe inspiring manifestations the beings conjured up 
while attacking. She looked thoughtfully at Aeka who sat staring as the 
victims of the Guardian effect reeled and rolled about. To the camera 
nothing seemed amiss while the shadowy image of the Guardian held the 
victims transfixed in it&#39;s gaze. Aeka seemed no worse for wear, 
considering what she went through.

She&#39;d been assigned a Guardian Force weeks ago and hadn&#39;t once summoned 
it. Quistis had hoped that Kippi: a friendly, cat-like guardian would 
ease the girl&#39;s apprehension. Sadly even in the face of death the girl 
still didn&#39;t trust it. After what had happened Quistis could only hope 
that Aeka would now have the courage to actually summon the spirit.

The film ran it&#39;s course and Quistis turned on the lights. She turned 
and faced the class.

&quot;Okay class, any questions?&quot; Quistis smiled a moment then frowned 
slightly.

She quickly nabbed her pointer from the chalkboard and strode up the 
center of the classroom. Everyone&#39;s head turned to follow as she stood 
before Fujin&#39;s desk. Fujin sat at her desk; head tossed back and 
sleeping blissfully. Aeka giggled and quickly put her hands over her 
mouth.

Royce whistled low and turned back around. Quistis knew Fujin was 
already well versed in Guardians but she could&#39;ve at least pretended to 
be interested. Quistis straightened and with a sharp crack she brought 
the pointer down hard on Fujin&#39;s desk. Fujin raised her head slowly and 
eyed Quistis.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry if my class bores you Miss Kazeno.&quot; Quistis said icily.

Fujin straightened and looked about with a frown.

&quot;If you don&#39;t mind, try to stay awake, or you can stand in the hall from 
now on.&quot; Quistis smiled brightly then went back to her desk. Luccian 
laughed quietly, happy for once that he wasn&#39;t the one being scolded.

Sitting down, Quistis folded her hands together.

&quot;Now then, you all have your assignments, if there are no questions, get 
to work.&quot;

*

Fujin shook her head and muddled through her test; she disliked having 
to sit through all this again but took solace in the fact it would only 
be for a short while. Feeling eyes on her she glanced around to find 
Luccian staring at her with his cool steel blue gaze. Obviously still 
miffed about her commandeering his seat she presumed. With blatant 
sarcasm she waved at him then went back to her studies. Luccian while 
not terribly concerned with her anymore he would&#39;ve loved to best her at 
least once. After the sound defeat she handled him on two separate 
occasions he was feeling more than a little put off.

&quot;Father would have loved that.&quot; He scowled inwardly at the mere thought 
of the fool that sired him. He would dwell on it no more and forced the 
anger to the back of his mind. Better to focus on things to come, there 
was still much to plan and petty matters of revenge could wait.

*

Lost in thoughts of romance mixed with careful decisions concerning the 
future Aeka was far removed from her test and her expression showed it.

Everything seemed brighter, more vibrant after her close encounter with 
death. She was also very aware that she could have easily been killed 
and that made her respect what she need to endure to pass the course.

Royce leaned over and whispered to her careful not to draw their 
teacher&#39;s attention.

&quot;I&#39;m glad your back, we all missed you.&quot; He said with a rich smile that 
Aeka found entrancing.

&quot;What about you?&quot; Aeka smiled shyly.

&quot;Of course, you&#146;re my best friend right?&quot; He winked. Aeka winked back 
but screamed inwardly.

&quot;No don&#39;t say that you fool.&quot; She wished she had the nerve to tell him 
how she felt.

&quot;Always friends, or like a sister, he could never see me like a woman.&quot; 
Grumbling she went back to her papers. Royce was puzzled by the somewhat 
grim expression she took but had little time to dwell on it. He noticed 
Quistis glaring directly him with a look of disapproval.

Stealing another worried look at Aeka he regretfully went back to work.

*********

Selphie wished she were dead.

&quot;Hyne just kill me....&quot; She gurgled then retched again as she clung 
desperately to the side of the toilet.

Irvine knocked on the door concerned by the horrid noises emanating from 
the bathroom.

&quot;You okay Selph?&quot; He asked softly.

A noise that no sober man should ever have to hear answered him 
threatening to turn his stomach against him also.

&quot;I take that as a no...&quot; He blanched.

&quot;Go away.&quot; Selphie whined.

&quot;That&#146;s what you get for drinking that mess.&quot; He scolded through the 
door.

&quot;I didn&#39;t ask you....&quot; She said through teary eyes only to hitch 
violently before giving herself once more to cold, unsympathetic, depths 
of the porcelain bowl. Irvine stuck out his tongue and made a noise as 
the smell of things best left unexplained hit him.

&quot;Um if you need anything let me know, I&#39;ll be....&quot; He looked around 
hopelessly. &quot;Doing something....&quot;

&quot;Fine...hic....just leave me be....urp....&quot; Selphie wheezed.

Irvine walked back out into the living room and plopped down on the 
couch, Celest came up behind him a place her hands on his shoulders.

&quot;She okay?&quot; She smiled.

&quot;I dunno.&quot; He rubbed the bridge between his eyes wearily.

&quot;Oh she&#39;s a tough gal.&quot; Celest whispered as she rubbed his shoulders.

&quot;Tell me about it.&quot; He sighed. &quot;She&#39;s just been so tense lately.&quot;

&quot;You all have honey if you ask me. You guys are the most moody buncha 
people I ever met.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re not normally like this, with the girls bickering like they are 
it&#39;s got everyone&#39;s nerves up.&quot; He sighed and closed his eyes as noises 
issued forth from the bathroom again. Celest made a face and leaned down 
to regard him.

&quot;You all need to relax before this nonsense has you all at each others 
throats.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right.&quot;

&quot;Of course I am.&quot; She laughed and hopped over the couch into his lap.

&quot;What the!?&quot; Irvine yelped. &quot;Aren&#39;t you supposed to be in class instead 
of bothering me?&quot;

&quot;Nope Mr. Sinclair took the class on a fieldtrip.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t go?&quot;

&quot;I declined, they&#39;re just visiting Galabania Garden.&quot;

&quot;Been there, done that. Time to change the subject.&quot; She giggled.

&quot;Oh Hyne I can only imagine. What is it now?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m having guy troubles.&quot; She pouted pitifully and rubbed the stubble 
on his chin. Blushing Irvine looked at her slightly worried.

&quot;Err okay what sort of trouble?&quot; He was nearly afraid to ask. Celest 
leaned close and whispered in his ear.

&quot;They won&#39;t leave me alone.&quot; She hissed causing him to fidget 
uncomfortably. The woman was an absolute nuisance at times but he loved 
the attention.

&quot;Well how can I help?&quot; He sighed, feigning annoyance.

&quot;You&#39;re Influential right?&quot;

&quot;I guess...&quot; He said warily.

&quot;Chase them off, do the big brother thing, tell them to leave me alone.&quot;

&quot;What, you&#39;re kidding right?&quot; Irvine laughed aloud at suggestion. Celest 
folded her arms in tiff and frowned.

&quot;Hey now except for you.&quot; She poked him in the chest harshly. &quot;All the 
guys I meet are dorks.&quot; She pouted once more. &quot;Just my luck, I meet one 
cool guy and he turns out to be my long lost brother.&quot; She rolled off 
him and slumped sadly on the couch. Irvine, still chuckling grew a tad 
more serious.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry so much.&quot;

&quot;Easy for you to say you don&#39;t have a bunch of hormone driven teens 
chasing at you all day.&quot; She frowned.

&quot;Hey now, you forget I&#39;m popular with the ladies, I feel your pain.&quot; 
Irvine sighed knowingly. Celest scoffed at that but kept quiet.

&quot;Besides I think you&#39;re just being melodramatic, it cant be that bad.&quot;

&quot;Ha, you think so, I can&#39;t even go to the gym without being gawked at.&quot;

Irvine laughed aloud.

&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; She pouted.

&quot;Because you bring that mess on yourself.&quot;

&quot;I do not!&quot; She fumed.

&quot;Sorry I have to disagree.&quot;

&quot;What are you trying to say.&quot; She eyed him dangerously.

&quot;You..well...&quot; He coughed back a laugh.

&quot;Look like a hussy.&quot; Selphie said sourly as she lurched out of the 
bathroom and into bedroom. Celest stood mouth agape as the little green 
woman shut the bedroom door without another word.

&quot;Um yeah..&quot; Irvine shrugged sheepishly.

&quot;I do not!&quot; Celest protested indignantly. &quot;I&#39;ll have you know, I studied 
fashion for three years before coming to the Gardens.&quot;

&quot;Well that just means you know how to dress for attention, and you 
wonder why they follow you around.&quot; Irvine laughed aloud.

&quot;Oh you&#39;re no help.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re the one doing it. I mean with the short skirts, halter-tops, and 
I&#39;m not even going to mention that little leather get up you wore when 
we first met.&quot; He whistled wolfishly.

&quot;Hey, you said I looked hot in that!&quot; She shoved him.

&quot;That&#146;s the whole point, you walk about like that, and people are going 
to react accordingly.&quot;

&quot;But I like to dress up, what&#39;s wrong with that?&quot;

Irvine clinched his hair and shook his head in annoyance.

&quot;You&#39;re hopeless, you want your cake and eat it too.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re saying I should tone it down.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s putting it mildly, try turning it off.&quot;

&quot;But that&#146;s boring, I&#39;ll end up having to dress like Edea.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#146;s nice.&quot; Irvine rolled his eyes. &quot;It&#39;s either that or quit 
complaining.&quot;

Celest threw her hands in the air and stormed out of the apartment. 
Irvine looked shocked by her sudden departure and burst into laughter.

*********************

&quot;I&#39;m here to see Headmaster Cid please.&quot; Luccian said politely, 
Archibald stood quietly behind him looking more than bored than usual. 
Cid&#39;s secretary, a youthful looking woman with platinum blonde hair and 
a stern demeanor looked at the two.

&quot;You gentlemen have a appointment?&quot;

&quot;Um no.&quot; Luccian frowned.

&quot;Told you.&quot; Archibald mumbled under his breath.

&quot;Hold on then.&quot; The woman hit her intercom. &quot;Sir you have visitors, 
shall I send them in?&quot;

&quot;This is never going to work, it&#39;s a stupid idea.&quot; Archibald mumbled 
again.

&quot;Shut up.&quot; Luccian growled under her breath.

&quot;Okay you can go in.&quot; The woman gestured to the door.

&quot;Thank you Ma&#39;am.&quot; Luccian said merrily while giving a smart-ass smile 
to Archibald, who simply regarded him with cold uncaring silence.

Cid eyed the two boys that entered his office and recognition hit him. 
One was former head of the Disciplinary Committee. The other youth he 
recognized but couldn&#39;t place the name.

&quot;Luccian.&quot; He nodded politely and gestured to the seats by his desk.

&quot;Sir.&quot; Luccian bowed courteously and sat while Archibald chose to remain 
standing.

&quot;What can I do for you boys?&quot; Cid asked, folding his hands on his desk.

&quot;Me and my friend need a leave of absence.&quot; Luccian asked simply.

&quot;For how long?&quot;

&quot;Two weeks probably.&quot;

&quot;Probably?&quot; Cid looked at the duo warily. &quot;Why the both of you?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s some things I have to take of concerning my fathers business. 
Archibald here will be working security when we graduate.&quot;

&quot;What sort of things. Is your father well, I&#39;ve heard that he was sick.&quot;

&quot;You could say that and no he&#39;s not well. Doctors say he&#39;ll be dead 
within two years, three tops.&quot;

&quot;Damn shame, Artemis is a good man, a genius in field.&quot;

Luccian bristled but kept his expression calm.

&quot;Yeah well, any fool can make a weapon sir.&quot; He said with notable bite.

&quot;You two still a odds I see.&quot;

&quot;One could say that.&quot;

&quot;One could also say they hate each other.&quot; Archibald snorted, earning 
withering glares from all concerned. He looked at the two and shrugged 
helplessly. &quot;I&#39;ll be in the hall.&quot;

&quot;Me and my father disagree on my potential.&quot; Luccian said mildly.

&quot;All things have potential child.&quot; Edea said hauntingly causing Cid and 
Luccian to jump with a start. She all but materialized from the shadowed 
hallway leading to her favored balcony.

&quot;I didn&#39;t hear you come in.&quot; Cid mumbled, adjusting his glasses.

&quot;My apologies.&quot; She smiled coolly and moved behind Luccian&#39;s chair.

&quot;Luccian is asking some leave time.&quot; Cid smiled fatherly at the youth.

&quot;How nice.&quot; Edea whispered, placing her hands on the boy&#39;s shoulders. 
Her hands where cold even through his jacket and he was painfully aware 
that her grip, while relaxed was viselike. Luccian wasn&#39;t sure why but 
he was terrified and wanted nothing more than to be away from her. It 
took all his will keep a fa&ccedil;ade of calm.

&quot;Hmm two weeks, so close to finals too.&quot; Cid frowned.

&quot;The boy has things to do.&quot; Edea said with a warm smile. &quot;He&#39;ll inherit 
great responsibility soon, surely you would not deny him that.&quot;

&quot;He will miss his studies, are you sure that&#146;s a good idea.&quot;

Edea looked down at Luccian with eyes that where like pools of ebon 
glass. &quot;There is time, there is always time. We&#39;ve done what we had to 
do, now let him do what he must.&quot;

&quot;Well said.&quot; Cid nodded and reached in his desk to get the forms.

&quot;We can go?&quot; Luccian asked.

&quot;Of course.&quot; Edea and Cid said in unison.

&quot;Wonderful.&quot; Luccian smiled thankfully and was even more thankful when 
Edea released him.

&quot;When are you leaving?&quot; Cid asked as he filled out the paperwork.

&quot;Tomorrow hopefully.&quot; Luccian said after a moments thought.

&quot;Zell and Squall are leaving on the Ragnarok tomorrow, I&#39;ll have them 
drop you two off.&quot;

&quot;Very well then.&quot; Luccian couldn&#39;t help but smile.

******************

Class was long over and Fujin sat her desk browsing Balamb&#39;s weapons 
database. Her chakram was in sore need of an upgrade. The weapon sat 
nestled in the seat next to her as she typed away at the computer built 
into the desktop. Quistis would glance up at her on occasion and offer a 
smile or two but mostly she occupied with grading the tests. Finding 
what she was looking for Fujin jotted down some notes and signed off. 
She was about to leave when Royce waltzed into the room. In his wake 
followed small horde of Treppies including Aeka.

&quot;So Royce who&#39;s the new member you keep talking about.&quot; Aeka asked as 
she circled him giggling.

&quot;It&#39;s a surprise.&quot;

&quot;Come on Royce don&#39;t be such a poop.&quot; Aeka whined cutely.

&quot;Watch out Royce she&#39;s a fighter, now she&#39;ll mess you up.&quot; One of the 
Treppies said jokingly. Aeka made a face at speaker then turned her 
attention back to their group leader.

Fujin sat horrified in her seat and was thankful no one noticed her. 
Calling upon her respectable skills at stealth she crept silently for 
the door.

&quot;Miss Trepe I have the card for our new member.&quot; He announced proudly.

&quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be glad to hear it.&quot; Quistis smiled like the cat that 
ate the canary.

&quot;Oh Fujin.&quot; She sang bubbly and looking to the door right as Fujin 
reached it. A cold shiver went up Fujin&#39;s spine and she slowly turned 
her gaze to the mob of people staring at her.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; She said slowly shaking her head.

&quot;Where ya going, Royce has your card?&quot; Quistis stood up and went to her, 
the Treppies dotting behind her like baby birds. Royce fished about in 
his pocket and retrieved the glossy membership card with Fujin and 
Quistis&#39;s picture on it. Several Treppies sounded off their jealousy 
that Quistis was actually in the photo.

&quot;You&#146;re the new member!&quot; Aeka gave a smiled that threatened to reach her 
ears.

&quot;Oh look at you, that&#146;s adorable.&quot; Quistis cooed at the picture.

Fujin simmered on a slow burn and regarded the troupe with much disdain.

She started to speak but didn&#39;t trust her mouth to form polite words. 
With startling swiftness she snatched the card from Royce&#39;s hands and 
stormed out of the class. Everyone except Quistis and Aeka stood aghast 
at the rude departure.

&quot;She&#39;s thankful.&quot; Quistis nodded reassuringly.

&quot;Yup.&quot; Aeka agreed.</pre>
