Balamb Garden was an impressive structure. Biblical in size, it dwarfed 
all but the biggest buildings. It was a work of functional art, looking 
a lot like a large metallic nautilus shell. Below it spun it&#146;s massive 
gravity rings. A product of magic and science it was the perfect home to 
the wondrous students within its halls. The entire structure was painted 
with beautiful runic designs giving it a noble and rich feel. It all 
paled when compared to the great city that rose before it on the 
horizon.

Eshtar was a marvel on a scale unimaginable. The buildings where all far 
larger than even Balamb Garden, threatening to pierce the very clouds 
above. Built of silvery steel and mirrored glass, the city shone like a 
gemstone on the crown of a god. Semi-translucent pathways arced 
throughout the city resembling rainbow colored ribbons. Cid gawked at 
the metropolis from a balcony in his study. He had never personally seen 
Eshtar till now, it was terrifying in its scale and beauty.

&quot;Gracious.&quot; He muttered under his breath. Edea moved beside him from the 
shadows and took his hand in hers.

&quot;Indeed. It is a impressive site.&quot; She spoke in a haunted yet alluring 
voice. Cid regarded her a moment. She had a pleasant almost impish 
glimmer in her eye.

&quot;You seem in a good mood dearest.&quot; He asked companionably. Edea squeezed 
his hand and smiled eerily. Though she had returned to normal it was 
hard sometimes not to see traces of the evil taint Ultimecia had planted 
in her. A dark look here, a sinister grin there, she had a aura that 
unsettle nearly everyone. It was not her fault and he knew it, although 
admittedly she frightened him sometimes. She was still very powerful in 
magic and he knew it even though she hid it well. He had known her all 
his life he could all but sense it.

&quot;Do not fear me, love.&quot; She said simply.

&quot;You know I don&#146;t.&quot; Cid replied somewhat meekly.

&quot;Sometimes.&quot; She gave a understanding smile.

Cid frowned and flushed. He adjusted his glasses absentmindedly, a habit 
he had when in distress. Edea leaned an kissed him on the cheek.

&quot;Fear is what makes us mortal. Do not be ashamed of it. Just know I 
could no more hurt you, than I could myself.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; He smiled at her warmly.

&quot;This will be good for them.&quot; She nodded out towards the city as they 
approached it&#146;s center.

&quot;The students?&quot;

&quot;Yes, this place it a wonder to behold. There is much to learn here.&quot;

&quot;You realize this is going to be a logistics nightmare. A lot people in 
Eshtar want to blame the outside world for what happen, regardless for 
what Laguna tells them.&quot; Cid rubbed his temples in worry. &quot;How did I 
Quistis talk me into this?&quot; He sighed wearily as the intercom buzzed 
with intense vigor.

&quot;Do not worry, everything will sort itself out.&quot; Edea smiled and nodded 
to the blinking intercom. &quot;You had best answer that, Nida is having 
trouble with docking clearance.&quot; Cid eyed her warily and shook his head. 
He hurried inside to answer the comm.

&quot;Yes?&quot; He asked thinly.

&quot;Eshtar&#146;s military is having a fit Sir!&quot; Nida all but yelled through the 
speaker.

&quot;I&#146;ll be right up, tell them to contact Laguna. He knows we are on the 
way.&quot;

&quot;Yes Sir.&quot;

Edea stood silent as several large fighter craft streaked towards, over 
and past the garden. Cid turned pale. He did not think to inform them 
they would be arriving in Balamb, and not a smaller craft like the 
Ragnarok.

&quot;Damnation.&quot; He mumbled.

Edea turned her head slightly at his cursing, then looked back out over 
the cities expanse. A large pyramid structure dominated the heart of the 
city. Edea arched a brow as massive warship floated out from behind the 
building.

***********************

Fujin was well on her way. The craft was hot and uncomfortable, but at 
least her speed gave her decent air conditioning with the windows down. 
Refueling went easily and she stuffed the back seat with all the 
supplies she could. She had gotten back to the station that afternoon, 
finished stocking up by sunset, and had flown all night. Now it was 
early the next morning and she was making great time. She yawned cutely 
as she traveled over the blinding expanse of a giant salt like. Great 
clouds of saline dust billowed up behind her as she tore over the 
horizon. She looked at the faded and brittle map on the seat beside her, 
the wind tried in vane to snare it away. The skull, the cause of so much 
of her problems the last few days served as a paper weight. The map said 
Eshtar was only about fifty miles away, she allowed herself a rare 
smile.

Her newly acquired craft cleared the lake bed and rose over its ridge. A 
stunning site greeted her eyes. Eshstar was still miles away but she 
could see it glimmering on the horizon like a sea of diamonds. She 
squinted thinly, something was over the city shimmering and moving. She 
didn&#146;t ponder it and settled back in her seat.

**************************

Quistis was in bed and cursing all things loud. Even buried under her 
pillow she heard the knocking at her door.

&quot;Go away, its the weekend.&quot; She mumbled.

More frantic knocking. Quistis contemplated some blue magic but thought 
better of it. She rolled out of bed and staggered to the door yanking it 
open. Squall stood there looking haggard.

&quot;Quistis!&quot; He said her name urgently.

&quot;Huh? What? Why are you here?&quot; She rubbed her hands through the tangle 
mess of her hair.

He looked about nervously before grabbing her by the shoulders.

&quot;What are you?&quot; Quistis stammered.

He pulled her to him and moved to kiss her. Quistis&#146;s eyes widened in 
shock, she had dreams that started like this. Now though she balked at 
the thought.

&quot;No! Hey?&quot; She started to pull away then felt him jump as if startled. 
He made a comical but pained face then fell forward. She backed up in 
shock as he landed face first on the floor. His rear in the air and his 
hands on his groin. She looked up in shock, her mouth agape. Fujin stood 
in the doorway. She was dressed in slinky a black evening gown, and a 
rose clenched firmly in her teeth. She winked devilishly then removed 
the rose. Then with a smooth gesture she shoved the moaning Squall over 
with her foot. Quistis stood dumbfounded as she sauntered up to her, and 
purred seductively. Fujin eyed her with impish glee, then quite abruptly 
reached around to grope her rear.

Quistis sat up nearly screaming in shock, loud knocking startled her 
again and she fell out of bed with a heavy thud. She looked about 
stunned and confused. The door banged again and she staggered out of her 
room to answer it. She yanked the door open, her expression full of 
annoyed grogginess. Squall stood in the door looking none to pleased and 
a bit haggard.

&quot;Quistis!&quot; He said her name urgently.

Quistis&#146;s eyes grew big as saucers and she exploded into laughter.

&quot;We need you at....?&quot; He drifted off. Completely caught off guard he 
just blinked in confusion. Quistis leaned on him hitching harshly as she 
laughed herself into tears. Squall stood still, his expression bland and 
tense. She calmed a bit and patted his shoulder before looking up. He 
regarded her sourly. She smiled broadly then snickered. Squall looked at 
her warily, she burst into laughter again. He sighed and waited for it 
to pass.

Quistis finally calmed then meekly looked up at him. Her eyes dancing 
merrily.

&quot;Sorry.&quot; She offered sheepishly.

Squall tongued his cheek in annoyance.

&quot;Are you done? When you feel up to it we could use you on the bridge. 
Seems you little vacation idea has nearly started a war.&quot; He said 
sourly, he then turned and walked up the hall.

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis charged out in the hall after him, clad only in her silk 
pajama tops and panties.

&quot;Wait a second!&quot; She grabbed him by the arm and spun him around. &quot;What 
happened?!&quot;

&quot;Just get dressed and meet us on the bridge.&quot; His voice was even and 
authoritative. He pulled free and walked away. She looked down and 
sighed heavily.

&quot;Damn it&quot; She cursed quietly as she walked back to her apartment, 
slamming the door behind her.&quot;

*********************

Cid was about to have a aneurysm, he jogged out of his office and into 
the near elevator. Klaxons sounded through out the garden. Edea watched 
him go with a passive expression before turning back to the spectacle 
outside. She was impressed at turnout their arrival caused. The first 
capital ship was joined by another. Both in orbit around the central 
command building of the city. A multitude of small fighter craft burst 
from the building like angry bees.

&quot;This is getting out of hand.&quot; She thought to herself, before walking 
off the balcony to follow her husband.

The bridge was alive with activity. Nida was talking as calm as possible 
into his headset, trying to convince the startled Eshtar military they 
meant no harm. Cid was yelling into his own headset trying to get 
through to Laguna. Xu added to fracas by telling to students to get to 
their stations, and prepare for defense. Squall had Zell telling him to 
ready the Ragnarok ready for lift off.

Quistis strode in alert and attentive. She looked at the chaos outside 
and on the bridge. Xu waved her over frantically.

&quot;What&#146;s going on?&quot; She headed quickly towards the head of student 
affairs.

&quot;Big foul up in communications. Esthar authorities where unaware we 
where coming. We have their entire military breathing down our necks.&quot; 
Xu shouted to her over the noise.

Quistis shot a look at Cid. He caught her look and held up his hands in 
defense.

&quot;A mistake, I figured Laguna knew what to expect.&quot; He rolled his eyes in 
dismay, made a screwed up face and went back to babbling in his headset.

&quot;Oh for the Love of..&quot; Quistis turned back to Xu. &quot;What do you need me 
to do?&quot;

&quot;I need you to go to the junior quarters and watch the children, keep 
the calm and assure them everything is under control.&quot;

Quistis had not expected that at all, she didn&#146;t care mind you. She just 
assumed she would be given a more important task than baby sitting. She 
glanced waywardly at Xu a moment.

&quot;Don&#146;t you think Selphie would be..&quot; She asked simply. Xu frowned 
slightly.

&quot;I have Selphie readying internal defense she cannot be sparred.&quot;

&quot;Ok I&#146;m on my way.&quot; She said calmly, then turned and walked into the 
elevator.

She stepped out into the main foyer just in time to see Irvine rushing 
by with about thirty or so Seed members. She was nearly ran over and had 
to hug the wall to keep from being squished. She noted they all had 
blast shields and where heading towards the main entrance. She hurried 
towards the junior quarters. As she jogged down the hall she came across 
Luccian, Archibald and Rinoa. They where leading a small group of 
children towards a near shelter. Rinoa saw her and tapped Luccian on the 
arm then pointed. He turned and nodded to curtly.

&quot;Quistis!&quot; Rinoa shouted hurriedly. &quot;Where are you headed?&quot;

&quot;Junior section.&quot;

&quot;Here take these kids then. We have to go get the defense screens up in 
the forward section!&quot; Rinoa leaned down and smiled at the children. &quot;We 
have to go take care of some things Ms. Trepe will take care of you from 
here out, okay?&quot; The kids nodded somberly and moved to Quistis. Luccian 
handed her a wailing four year old boy.

&quot;Here, he tripped and scuffed his knee.&quot; He had a bemused smirk on his 
face that she wanted to slap off. Rinoa smiled apologetically at her 
then jogged off with Luccian and Archibald in tow.

Quistis stood in the center of the hall expressionless. One of the kids 
tugged her skirt impatiently causing her to look down. A bright eyed 
little girl with pig tails and red hair smiled up at her.

Quistis chuckled softly and looked down at her.

&quot;I made poopy.&quot; The girl announced proudly. Quistis hung her head in 
dismay.

**********************************

Fujin brought the craft to a halt on a dusty access road leading into 
the city. A squadron of hovering police craft formed a road block. She 
looked in awe beyond them, she was surprised to see Balamb hovering in 
the sky near the central building. Swarms of military and police 
vehicles buzzed around it with lights and sirens blaring. A officer got 
out of his craft and walked up to her,

&quot;Ma&#146;am all roads are closed at the moment. There is a situation.&quot; The 
officer was a large dark-skinned man with stern smile and a frame the 
size of a tank.

&quot;WHEN?&quot; She asked, a impatient look on her face.

&quot;When what?&quot;

&quot;OPEN.&quot; She so hated talking to people.

&quot;Don&#146;t yell at me girl, I am just doing my job.&quot; He folded his arms and 
glared. She did not want to provoke him since this was not her craft nor 
did she have a license.

&quot;There&#146;s a road house over there.&quot; He gestured to a gaudy structure 
built to look like a giant adobe chocobo. &quot;You can sit this out over 
there.&quot;

She didn&#146;t even try to complain. She backed up and turned her craft 
towards the ugly building. A sign saying; CoCo Choco bar and grill. Hung 
out front surrounded by blinking neon and the skulls of various 
monsters. She parked and got out, the door creaking loudly with rust. 
She had to push and kick to get it to shut again. She removed her dusty 
and soiled jacket and tossed it into the back seat through the broken 
window. A few rotund good ol boys eyed her. She gave them a slight nod 
as she walked inside. The place smelled of cigars and cheap beer. The 
place was full of large rowdy men and equally large rowdy women. She was 
suddenly aware how short she was, as woman of immense size appeared from 
around a near corner. The woman was drunk and wobbled into her slamming 
her against the wall with her girth. Fujin had to struggle not to attack 
the behemoth.

&quot;Sorry little girl I didn&#146;t see ya there.&quot; The woman said between liquor 
soaked belches. Fujins eyes turned to dangerous slits. She grumbled 
under her breath and walked away.

She slid into a booth and waited for a waiter or waitress. She looked up 
started at the booth ahead of her. She saw a familiar crop of blonde 
hair, and a white coat collar peeking up over the back of seat. She 
jumped up catching her knee on the table painfully.

&quot;SEIFER!&quot; She shouted abruptly. The figure in the chair turned and 
looked over the booth at her.

A seedy looking woman with a thick neck and a body more fitting a large 
primate regarded her curiously. Fujin sank back in her seat and offered 
a embarrassed smile.

&quot;APOLOGY&quot; She blurted in embarrassment, then grabbed a menu from a 
passing busboy.

The woman stared at her a moment then turned back to her meal.

************************************

The sun was setting and the air above Eshtar was still buzzing with 
various aircraft. Inside Balamb garden things where just as busy. Cid 
was pacing nervously at the front gate of the school. Squall, Irvine, 
Zell, Selphie and Rinoa stood nearby. All eyes where skyward as large 
ornate shuttle was preparing to land on the front plaza. Cid looked up 
and sighed with relief, as the shuttles landing gear thudded heavily on 
the paved walkway before them. After a few moments side of the shuttle 
opened wide. A ramp extended outward from the opening then lowered 
itself to the ground. Several figures rushed down the ramp, they wore 
silver and blue body armor and carried heavy laser rifles. They took a 
defensive stance in front of the Garden faculty, watching them warily 
and their guns leveled. Squall scowled darkly at all of this and gripped 
his gunblade reflexively. Cid gave him a calming look, he turned back to 
face the squad of soldiers.

&quot;I&#146;m Headmaster Cid of Balamb Garden. Is Laguna here I was told he was 
coming to see us.&quot;

A bit of a argument was heard aboard the shuttle. A tall slim man rushed 
down the walkway, several guards hurried behind him. The man wore blue 
dress pants and white shirt. His hair was long and black with a touch of 
silver in places. Well into his forties, he was handsome and held 
childlike brightness in his eyes.

He abruptly stumbled and bumped face first into a near female soldier. 
He awkwardly put up a hand to brace himself, groping her by accident. 
The woman to her credit weathered this with a staggering amout of 
professionalism. The man looked at her in ashen horror and stood upright 
saluting her.

&quot;Um so sorry! Er good work, um nice uniform.&quot; He babbled apologetically, 
blushing bright red the whole time. The woman returned the salute and 
stood statuesque.

Squall buried his head in his hand and shivered.

&quot;How could this dork have ruled so long without being overthrown.&quot; He 
wondered to himself. Zell stepped towards him grinning like a boob.

&quot;Kinda favors you don&#146;t ya think?&quot; He whispered laughingly. Squall swung 
at him sourly only to miss as Zell ducked and hopped back. He laughed 
quietly and resumed his position between Irvine and Selphie.

Cid stepped forward to greet the man walking towards them.

&quot;Mr President.&quot; He said with guarded smile.

&quot;Oh stop that Cid you know to call me Laguna.&quot; Laguna grinned &quot;We&#146;re all 
friends here right?&quot; He clapped Cid on the shoulder and turned to face 
the squad of troops giving them the thumbs up. A visible wave of relief 
spread through the troops and one of them discreetly called into his 
radio. Soon after, the warships in the distance started to pull away as 
did a majority of the smaller fighter craft. Laguna waved his arm at his 
body guards

&quot;Head on back guys I&#146;ll catch up later.&quot;

His troops filed into the shuttle, soon after, the craft rose into the 
night sky and departed.

Laguna watched it go then turned to Cid.

&quot;I&#146;m so sorry about all of that, the people are overly paranoid of 
unexpected visitors.

&quot;I&#146;ts my fault, I should you we would be arriving in Balamb.&quot; Cid looked 
down glumly.

Laguna frowned and shuffled absently.

&quot;Err well to be honest, it was my fault.&quot; He offered a awkward grin.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Cid eyed him cautiously.

&quot;I forgot to tell anyone you was coming.&quot; He said sheepishly.

Squall threw his hands in the air and sat down on the near curb. Zell 
grinned and shook his head.

&quot;Aw jeeze&quot; Selphie giggled behind her hand. Irvine elbowed her slightly 
and just smiled.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Was all Cid could manage. He should be upset, but was more 
thankful that nothing happened.

&quot;I must be getting forgetful in my old age.&quot; Laguan grinned. &quot;So how&#146;s 
everything going on your end?&quot;

&quot;Oh much better now. Hold on a second please.&quot;

&quot;Xu?&quot; Cid said calmly into his headset.

&quot;Yes Sir? How&#146;s the situation?&quot; She asked worriedly.

&quot;Everything&#146;s fine, have everyone stand down. Thank them for their help.

&quot;Will do.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Xu, good work.&quot;

&quot;Thank you Sir.&quot;

Cid looked back at Laguna and motioned him to follow.

&quot;Come on in. I don&#146;t think you ever visited Balamb before, right?&quot;

&quot;Sure haven&#146;t.&quot;

&quot;Well lets give you the tour then.&quot; Cid led him inside leaving Squall 
and the others on the walkway dumbfounded.

Squall rolled his eyes and looked back at the others.

&quot;Lets get out of here guys.&quot; He grumbled before heading indoors.

&quot;That&#146;s it?&quot; Zell blurted. Selphie kicked him in the rear.

&quot;Hush.&quot; She giggled then ran to catch Squall.

&quot;Hey now!&quot; Zell glared at her sourly.

Irvine ruffled his hair.

&quot;Calm down squirt.&quot; He too, then walked inside.

&quot;Hey!?&quot; He looked gruffly at the cowboy as he slicked his hair back in 
place.

Suddenly he noticed he was standing by himself.

&quot;Wait for me!&quot; He shouted then jogged after them.

*************************

It was fairly late when Xu walked into the shelter. She saw Quistis 
sitting in the darkness, a sea of young children where scattered about 
her feet fast asleep.

&quot;Well hey there.&quot; Xu said quietly.

&quot;Hello.&quot; Quistis replied darkly.

&quot;Everything okay here?&quot; She asked as she tiptoed over.

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;You did good.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Quistis responded acidly.

&quot;Where&#146;s the other faculty members?.&quot; Xu looked around curiously.

&quot;I&#146;m it.&quot;

&quot;Oh dear.&quot; Xu shirked. &quot;I forgot to send you back up.&quot;

Quistis sat quietly.

&quot;Quistis I&#146;m sorry.&quot; Xu tried. Quistis turned her icy gaze upon her.

&quot;What would have happened I wonder? If something happened to me?&quot; She 
stood and looked down at the shorter woman.

&quot;Nothing happened though, it was a mistake.&quot; Xu stared up unflinching.

&quot;Bullshit! Your dodging the point. Who would have looked out for these 
kids!&quot; Quistis hissed.

&quot;No I see the point clearly Miss! Trepe!&quot; Xu sneered back in a whisper. 
&quot;Your pissed off cause you had to baby sit. Sorry to burst your bubble 
lady but you weren&#146;t needed up top.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s not the point and you know it!&quot; Quistis grew flush.

&quot;Oh I think it is. Come to think of it you&#146;ve been erratic of late and 
everyone knows it.&quot;

&quot;What are you saying?&quot; Quistis eyed her dangerously.

&quot;Perhaps we need to rethink your teaching duties.&quot;

&quot;You wouldn&#146;t dare.&quot;

&quot;Wouldn&#146;t I?&quot; Xu looked at her incredulously. &quot;Quistis I&#146;m not you enemy 
here. We are from the same class for god sake, get a grip on yourself.&quot;

&quot;Listen here!&quot; Quistis raised her voice.

&quot;No you listen!&quot; Xu pointed at her. &quot;You missed a class, you&#146;ve be 
argumentative with staff, you even struck a student for the love of 
Hyne!&quot;

&quot;He was threatening me.&quot; Quistis sputtered angrily.

&quot;So you say. I hear tell you two had a argument, kind of like we are. 
So, what are you going to hit me now?&quot; Xu starred at her hotly, the 
woman was short and slender but was hell on wheels when riled. Quistis 
felt drained and tired, her will was to battered to deal with all of 
this now.

&quot;I&#146;m not getting into this with you Xu.&quot; She said softly and closed her 
eyes to calm herself.

&quot;I didn&#146;t think so.&quot; Xu said gratified.

&quot;Loser.&quot; Quistis thought to herself. &quot;You can&#146;t even stand up for 
yourself.&quot;

&quot;What now?&quot; She said weakly.

Xu put her hands on her hips and looked around.

&quot;Well, lets get these kids to their rooms. We&#146;ll get their dorm heads to 
help us.&quot;

&quot;Why weren&#146;t they with these kids?&quot;

&quot;Because they where in shelters A and B with the other children.&quot; Xu 
grumbled annoyed. &quot;Quit arguing and lets just get this over with.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot; Quistis sighed heavily.

*********************************

Fujin sat at her booth bored witless. She had no idea how long she sat 
there. A large television hung in the center of the pub, local news 
babbled about a supposed threat in Eshtar. She only listened with half a 
ear, she was lost in thought.

&quot;Why?&quot; She wondered. Thinking back to her reaction upon seeing who she 
thought was Seifer.

&quot;I&#146;m over that now. I don&#146;t need anyone.&quot; She frowned at that thought.

&quot;What about Quistis? Do you need her?&quot;

&quot;Do I? I don&#146;t know.&quot;

&quot;I know she doesn&#146;t need me. No one needs me. She beautiful and popular 
she has friends. She doesn&#146;t need me.

&quot;Your running away again.&quot;

&quot;What can I do? It&#146;s just like Seifer.&quot;

&quot;No it&#146;s not.&quot;

&quot;Yes it is, but worse.&quot;

&quot;How so?&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m just chasing dreams like always. I don&#146;t even understand what I 
feel.&quot;

&quot;What&#146;s to understand you care for her and she cares for you.&quot;

&quot;Does she?&quot;

&quot;What do you think. Your fooling yourself if you think otherwise.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t know. She would be better off without me. I&#146;m poison.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s not like you.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s true, I&#146;m damaged goods.&quot;

&quot;I should try to find Seifer.&quot;

&quot;After the way he treated you.&quot;

&quot;He looked out for me.&quot;

&quot;How? By telling you, your ugly?&quot;

&quot;He was drunk.&quot;

&quot;How about when he took his anger and self loathing out on you.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m tough I could handle it.&quot;

&quot;How about when he brought his girlfriends around. He did it on purpose, 
he knew you loved him.

&quot;Never! He looked out for me.&quot;

&quot;He was teasing you, showing you what you&#146;d never have.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#146;t like that! He wasn&#146;t like that!&quot;

&quot;Seifer had you under his heel. Nipping behind him like good dog.&quot;

&quot;We we&#146;re family.&quot;

&quot;Raijin knew the truth, dim as he was, he knew the truth.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s why he left. He couldn&#146;t stand to see what you became when 
Seifer left.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m strong I don&#146;t need anyone.&quot;

&quot;You let him abuse you hurt you mentally and physically.&quot;

&quot;He...&quot;

&quot;Now that your away from him you understand.&quot;

&quot;He cared, In his own way he cared.&quot;

&quot;He made himself feel taller by stepping on you.&quot;

&quot;He wouldn&#146;t&quot;

&quot;Do you remember.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t want to.&quot;

&quot;Do you remember that night.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t want to.&quot;

&quot;You have to, you have to move on.&quot;

&quot;I was only fourteen at the time.&quot;

*****************************************

It was dark outside and we where out later than we should have been. 
Squall and Seifer where on the cliffs dueling again. I liked watching 
them fight, they where poetry in motion. They claimed their battles 
where for practice. I knew better, there was something more, something 
primal and raging. They both of burned inside. I could relate to that, 
we all had out reasons for anger. I looked up at the growing storm and 
rain started to fall. It was beautiful, the two of them battled like 
gods. Attractive and powerful, they gave no quarter nor asked for it.

The storm was in full rage when the last blow was struck. To my surprise 
Squall won, he caught the light of my life across the temple with the 
flat of his blade. Seifer fell into the mud with a certain finality that 
made my heart stop. I wanted to run to him, to comfort him in is defeat. 
But I knew he would spurn me. So I sat quietly like a good girl. Squall 
began to walk away, imagine by joy when Seifer arose again like a 
phoenix from the flame. Something was wrong, he had a dangerous glint in 
his eye. He had never been beat before I realized.

&quot;NO!&quot; I whispered. Seifer called out to Squall and charged him. Squall 
turned and parried his attack. Squall screamed at him for being 
reckless. Seifer was enraged and charged again. I realized what Squall 
did not. Seifer was meaning to kill him. I ran out and wrapped my arms 
around him, holding him and screaming for him to back down before 
someone got hurt. Squall cursed us, calling Seifer insane he stormed off 
into the night. Seifer stood quietly, he wasn&#146;t even struggling against 
me. I could feel his warmth against me as I held him, my head buried 
against his strong back. With a sigh he slackened and dropped his blade.

&quot;Fujin.&quot; He whispered. I loved when he said my name.

I asked if he was okay. He nodded and I let go of him slowly wanting to 
savor him a little longer. He slowly turned and looked down at me. His 
eyes, his gorgeous eyes. I desperately wanted to be with him. He was 
trembling, his eyes sad and sparkling. My heart went out to him. He 
offered me a soft smile as he knelt to recover his blade. I watched him 
intently, quietly there was something happening. He stood before me 
slick with rain, both of us soaked to the bone, clothing hugging our 
curves. He was beautiful, I wanted to tell him my feelings. I started to 
speak, emotion overwhelming me. There was something indeed something 
between us now, intense, and powerful. He seemed to move in slow motion. 
His eyes had tears in them as he laid a gently hand on my cheek. I 
closed my eyes at his touch my heart pounded and I felt him tensing. I 
surrendered myself to him.

He suddenly sank his fingers into my hair gripping painfully. I opened 
my eyes in shock. He was still crying, but his face devoid of emotion. 
He brought his sword up and slammed the hilt against the side of my 
head. I felt my left eye burst under the impact, my temple and cheek 
shattered. The pain to my heart was far worse, with one blow he 
destroyed my reality. I gave up everything then all hope, all happiness. 
I fell into the mud blinded by pain and anguish. He landed atop me 
straddling my chest. His fists assaulted me, but I did not care anymore 
and let myself cease being.

They found me at the bottom of the cliff, nearly dead or so I was told. 
It was days before I actually awoke. I would recover but my eye was 
ruined. They asked what happened, I told them I had slipped. They would 
have taken him from me if they knew the truth and I did not want to be 
alone. Raijin suspected what happened, I could tell by the looks he gave 
me. Much like myself he was comfortable where he was. We where all a 
family for better of for worse...

************************

Tears where streaming down Fujin&#146;s face. She knew the ugly truth of it. 
She hated herself for being so weak against him. She stood shakily and 
realized several patrons where looking at her.

She snarled at them then started to run. Her ankle exploded into hot 
white pain and she fell to floor hard. She gritted her teeth fighting 
back a scream of rage and pain. A gentle hand took her by the arm. She 
looked up, her eyes burning. A unassuming man stood over her, he looked 
was far older and had a regal presence about him. His gray, sad eyes 
looked upon her with a understanding and wisdom she could not fathom. He 
wore a simple black suit and had long black hair that was tied neatly in 
the back.

&quot;Are you okay child.&quot; He said soothingly as he helped her up.

&quot;FINE!&quot; She scowled, angrily pulling away from him. She regretted it and 
softened a bit. &quot;SORRY.&quot; She offered.

&quot;Perfectly fine, Is this yours?&quot; He handed her, the self made crutch 
she&#146;d been using.

&quot;THANKS.&quot; She took it and settled it under her arm. She looked at him a 
moment then headed towards the door.

&quot;Miss?&quot; He said evenly. She turned and looked at him wearily, she was so 
tired.

&quot;If you don&#146;t mind me saying so, you seem a bit worse for wear. Do you 
have a place to stay?&quot;

She frowned, here she thought he was being nice and instead he&#146;s some 
jerk trying to hit on her.

&quot;Yes.&quot; She said flatly and hobbled to the door.

&quot;Good, It&#146;s late and I&#146;m sure someone&#146;s worried about you.&quot; He then 
turned and walked quietly to the bar. She turned to regard him a moment, 
then stepped out into the night. She unlocked the battered hover craft 
and climbed inside. She pulled the keys from her pocket and stuck them 
in the ignition. It took an aggravating amount of time to get the engine 
started and she smelled burning oil. The engine was on it&#146;s last legs 
and she knew it. The craft rose into air belching white smoke and 
shuttering. She headed once more to the road leading to Eshtar. Whatever 
had happened earlier was over, the road was clear and she was on her 
way.

*************************************

Quistis staggered to her apartment. It was so very late and she was so 
very tired physically and emotionally. She unlocked the door and kicked 
her shoes into a corner. She slipped out of her clothes leaving them in 
a trail behind her as she went to her bedroom. She entered her room and 
without in ado she fell in a heap onto her bed, she was sound asleep 
moments later. Her dreams offered no refuge, they were dark and 
tortured. A landscape made of hopelessness, self loathing and 
loneliness. She had fallen into the inky blackness of her mind. She lay 
naked, broken, defenseless and to far gone to care anymore. Only one 
thing lived in this lonely place. The only thing that really wanted her 
and it welcomed her with open arms.

The beast simply smiled and waited for her.......</pre>
