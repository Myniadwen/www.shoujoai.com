&quot;I can&#146;t even begin to apologize.&quot; Quistis sighed, as Fujin brought her 
a wet rag. Kevin said nothing, his face red and puffy from where 
Nicole&#146;s dragon had latched onto his face. After the removal of the 
terrified animal Quistis quickly spirited the traumatized Kevin back to 
her apartment.

&quot;At least she didn&#146;t break the skin.&quot; She chatted quietly touching the 
rag to his face. Fujin shook her head, still amused by the whole affair 
and sat down on the nearby loveseat.

&quot;This is not at all how I was expecting our reunion to be.&quot; Kevin 
grinned.

&quot;I can imagine.&quot; Quistis smirked tabbing the cold cloth to his cheeks in 
hopes to lessen the swelling. &quot;Well at least you&#146;re out of there.&quot;

&quot;Won&#146;t your friends be mad that you left?&quot;

&quot;Nah, considering the circumstances I&#146;m sure Nicole would&#146;ve kicked us 
all out anyway.&quot;

&quot;Who&#146;s idea was it to keep a monster for a pet?&quot;

&quot;Be nice.&quot; Quistis frowned slightly then handed the rag back to Fujin, 
thanking her.

&quot;HE LIVE?&quot; Fujin said with a faint grin.

&quot;I think so.&quot;

&quot;GOING THEN.&quot;

&quot;Oh no, why?&quot; Quistis frowned in dismay

&quot;LAST ESSAY.&quot;

&quot;Essay?&quot;

&quot;REMEMBER, FINAL ESSAY.&quot;

&quot;Oh yikes!&quot; Quistis balked. &quot;That&#146;s in the morning, I&#146;ve still some last 
minute paperwork to do!&quot;

&quot;Sounds like you two have a busy night planned. I guess I&#146;ll retire for 
the evening too. Fu hold on a minute and I&#146;ll walk you your apartment.&quot; 
Kevin suggested in a friendly tone.

&quot;FUJIN...&quot; Fujin corrected him with a venomous glare.

&quot;Fujin.&quot; Kevin amended, blushing.

&quot;You two have fun.&quot; Quistis giggled as she walked them to the door. &quot;See 
you guys tomorrow.&quot;

Fujin was already taking long strides up the hall before the door even 
shut. Kevin, taken aback by her immediate departure had to jog to catch 
up with her.

&quot;Whoa, slow down there turbo.&quot;

&quot;SPEED UP.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m sensing some hostility here.&quot;

&quot;MISTAKEN.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t buy it.&quot;

&quot;DON&#146;T CARE.&quot;

&quot;Aggressive soul aren&#146;t you.&quot;

&quot;THEN LEAVE.&quot;

&quot;We&#146;re all friends here, Quistis seems to think highly of you and I&#146;d 
like to get to know you better.&quot;

Fujin looked at him with near fearful expression.

&quot;DON&#146;T KNOW YOU.&quot; She scoffed thinking he was making a pass. 
Backpedaling, Kevin elaborated.

&quot;I don&#146;t mean like that, I mean as a friend, you seem like an 
interesting person.&quot;

Fujin could have laughed and stopped to regard him oddly as they arrived 
at the central elevator.

&quot;NOT WORTH IT.&quot;

&quot;Sure you are.&quot;

&quot;MEANT YOU.&quot; She said dryly before stepping into the elevator.

Kevin was totally taken by surprise by her comment and was nearly left 
behind. Jamming his hand between the doors at the last second, he slid 
into the elevator and eyed her shrewdly.

&quot;I&#146;m going to assume you&#146;re just being funny. Quistis says you have a 
odd sense of humor.&quot; He said grinned as the elevator jolted slightly and 
began to descend.

&quot;BELIEVE WHAT WANT.&quot; Fujin shrugged, opening the panel on the control 
box and inserting her key.

&quot;Um what are you doin?&quot;

&quot;GOING HOME.&quot;

&quot;But aren&#146;t the living quarters...?&quot; He mumbled while looking nervous as 
the elevator stopped between floors and opened into darkness. &quot;Where are 
we?&quot; He asked somewhat nervously. Stepping out into the darkness Fujin 
didn&#146;t answer.

&quot;Hey wait, I want to talk to you about something.&quot; He called to her, but 
she was already gone. He frowned skeptically at the darkness a moment, 
unsure as to what he was seeing. He could easily imagine her waiting for 
him with an axe or some other implement of murder.

&quot;Damn it.&quot; He frowned then hurried after her. A blue glow twinkled 
around him like water reflecting in the moonlight as he caught up with 
her.

&quot;Where are we?&quot; He asked again, looking at softly billowing sheets of 
silk in wonder. Fujin didn&#146;t answer feeling the answer was obvious.

&quot;You live here?&quot; He asked as she bent to remove her shoes.

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Roomy place, you live here with you&#146;re boyfriend?&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Oh, just you then?&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Interesting decor.&quot;

Fujin was finding the idle chatter annoying as she slipped through the 
hanging sheets and headed towards her clothes hamper. Kevin walked about 
curiously, looking around; he noticed a couple of photos on the nearby 
nightstand. Quistis he recognized immediately, the other was of Raijin 
and he looked up curiously.

&quot;You&#146;re boyfriend?&quot; He queried.

&quot;BROTHER.&quot; She snapped irritably.

&quot;Oh really? He looks nothing like you.&quot; Kevin chuckled. Fujin stormed 
over to him. Snatching the photo from his hand, she slammed it back down 
on the nightstand.

&quot;WHY?&quot; She scowled.

&quot;What, why what?&quot; Kevin blinked uncomprehendingly.

&quot;WASTING TIME.&quot; Fujin snapped, folding her arms expectantly.

&quot;I&#146;m lost here, your obviously mad about something. What did I do?&quot;

&quot;HERE FOR REASON.&quot;

&quot;I told you, I just wanted to get to know you better.&quot;

&quot;BULLSHIT.&quot; Fujin said flatly.

&quot;No need to get hostile. Look if I offended you somehow.&quot;

&quot;NOT INTERESTED IN ME.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;KNOW WHAT MEAN.&quot;

&quot;I do?&quot;

&quot;QUISTIS.&quot;

&quot;What about her.&quot;

&quot;YOU TELL ME.&quot;

&quot;What do you want me to say?&quot; Kevin balked, somewhat startled.

&quot;WANT ME TALK TO HER.&quot;

&quot;Wait a minute, what are you...&quot;

&quot;WANT ME PUT IN GOOD WORD.&quot;

&quot;Well I guess, I mean yeah.&quot; He stammered.

&quot;DO YOURSELF.&quot; Fujin scowled, stalking towards him.

&quot;Huh, wait a minute I never even asked you to do anything.&quot;

&quot;WOULD HAVE.&quot; She coughed, wincing slightly.

&quot;How do you know that.&quot;

&quot;EXPERIENCE.&quot;

&quot;Your jumping to conclusions.&quot;

&quot;TALK TO UGLY FRIEND.&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot;

&quot;TO GET TO BEAUTY.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s absurd.&quot; He babbled but couldn&#146;t help but feel guilty.

&quot;LIAR.&quot; Fujin laughed.

&quot;You&#146;re a very unhappy person aren&#146;t you.&quot; Kevin mumbled quietly.

&quot;ON CONTRARY.&quot; She chuckled, shaking her head.

&quot;Then what&#146;s with the hostility?&quot;

&quot;YOU.&quot;

&quot;What about me? What did I do to you?&quot;

&quot;PROCRASTINATING.&quot;

&quot;About what?&quot;

&quot;QUISTIS.&quot; She coughed again with a frown.

&quot;I am not?&quot;

&quot;YOU TWO NEED TALK.&quot;

&quot;Tell me about it. I&#146;ll try again later, when she&#146;s more receptive.&quot;

Fujin could scream in aggravation but couldn&#146;t help but feel sorry for 
him. It was Quistis&#146; fault for leaving him hanging, she should have be 
straight with him from the beginning.

&quot;GO.&quot; She sighed, pointing to the door.

&quot;Fine, fine, look. Honestly I was just trying to get to know you and you 
are not the ugly friend, you actually rather cute.&quot; He smiled, perhaps 
if Quistis turns me down...&quot;

&quot;OUT!&quot; Fujin roared.

&quot;Alright, I&#146;m going, Hyne...&quot;

&quot;SEE QUISTIS, NOW!&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m going. Though I don&#146;t know what you expect me to say.&quot;

&quot;NOTHING, JUST LISTEN.&quot; Fujin shouted before falling into a rapid series 
of short, harsh coughs. Kevin departed quickly, shaken and thoroughly 
confused by the oddly volatile encounter. Fujin bristled as he left and 
shook her head. Something told her this would not go well and she was 
already preparing for the inevitable fireworks.

**********************

Quistis stared at the scattered papers on her desk dully. Kevin was on 
her mind. He was getting persistent and she knew she couldn&#146;t diffuse 
his advances much longer, she had to make a decision and soon. A knock 
on the door was a thankful distraction and she quickly moved to answer 
it. Swinging the door open she was greeted by Kevin&#146;s perplexed face.

&quot;Um welcome back.&quot; She said guardedly. &quot;I thought you turned in for the 
evening?&quot;

Kevin scratched the back of his head and shrugged. &quot;I had a rather odd 
conversation with Fujin.&quot; He said quietly. Quistis tensed up and giggled 
nervously as he continued.

&quot;She told me to come talk to you...She was pretty insistent.&quot; He 
shrugged.

&quot;Fujin sent you?&quot; Quistis said with a fair amount of disbelief.

&quot;Uh...yeah. If you don&#146;t mind me saying so, you&#146;re friend is very, very 
weird.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t make me kick you out.&quot; Quistis said flatly as she motioned him to 
enter.

&quot;Sorry, we we&#146;re at her quarters...&quot; He started and Quistis turned to 
regard him questionably.

&quot;Nothing happened calm down.&quot; He assured her.

&quot;It&#146;s not that, it just that she never invites company over.&quot;

&quot;Well I kind followed her down there.&quot;

&quot;Well not to be rude but that explains why she was being weird then. She 
probably just wanted to get rid of you.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s nice.&quot; Kevin groused sarcastically.

&quot;She&#146;s not really a people person.&quot;

&quot;So I noticed. How in the world did you two become friends? You&#146;ve 
nothing in common.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;d be surprised.&quot; Quistis said quietly.

&quot;I bet I would, anyway though, she told me to come talk to you.&quot;

&quot;About?&quot; Quistis asked, eyeing him warily.

&quot;Um...well us...I guess&quot; Kevin grinned sheepishly. &quot;She thought I was 
trying to use her to get to you.&quot;

&quot;Oh okay, I think I understand now.&quot; Quistis sighed, holding her head 
wearily.

&quot;Good, you can tell me what&#146;s going on then.&quot;

Quistis stood up and paced a moment. Kevin frowned, he could tell he 
wasn&#146;t going to like what he was about to hear.

&quot;You&#146;re seeing someone aren&#146;t you.&quot; He guessed.

Quistis looked up and offered a grim smile. Kevin slumped a moment and 
let out a sigh before standing up.

&quot;You could&#146;ve just said so.&quot; He laughed, clapping her on the shoulder. 
&quot;I knew it was a possibility. I just wish you said something early so I 
wouldn&#146;t have made a fool of myself.&quot;

&quot;Oh Hyne, you&#146;re not a fool, it&#146;s my fault.&quot; Quistis explained weakly

&quot;True.&quot; He chuckled. &quot;But I forgive you.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re being awfully understanding.&quot; She said cautiously.

&quot;Look I told you, I knew there was a chance you had settled down with 
someone. I&#146;m curious though... I get the impression you&#146;re friends don&#146;t 
know.&quot;

Quistis gave a strained smile. &quot;They don&#146;t.&quot;

&quot;Sounds intriguing.&quot; He chuckled sitting down to wait for an 
explanation. &quot;Who is he, some drifter, perhaps that Seifer guy I keep 
hearing about?&quot; Kevin smiled wolfishly. Quistis eyes bugged and she 
winced in disgust.

&quot;No, no, no...&quot; She ranted.

&quot;Who then.&quot; He prodded.

&quot;It&#146;s complicated.&quot;

&quot;Complicated... You&#146;re having an affair!&quot; He shouted jumping up in 
surprise.

&quot;WHAT!? NO!?&quot; Quistis shouted in horror.

&quot;Who is it, Zell?&quot;

&quot;No gods no!&quot;

&quot;Irvine then? Oh that&#146;s just wrong, he&#146;s getting married!&quot;

&quot;Kevin for the love of...you should know me better than that.&quot;

&quot;Squall, you and Squall!&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s not funny.&quot;

&quot;Who&#146;s joking, come on tell me.&quot; He laughed moving closer with the 
intention of tickling the answer from her.

&quot;Fujin.&quot; Quistis blurted, pushing him away before he could start.

&quot;Sure, right, who is it?&quot; He chuckled.

Quistis stared at him hollowly.

&quot;Wait...you&#146;re serious.&quot; He paused. &quot;Fujin, you&#146;re friend, Fujin...?&quot;

Quistis nodded solemnly.

&quot;Wow...&quot; Kevin blinked, and fell back into his seat as if punched.

&quot;Now you know.&quot; Quistis sighed, sitting down beside him.

&quot;Um...well...this is a surprise.&quot; He said quietly.

&quot;Sorry...&quot;

&quot;So you&#146;re who she was talking about then.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Wow...&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t know what to tell you.&quot; She murmured.

&quot;Oh you told me plenty.&quot; He nodded briskly. &quot;I would have never 
guessed.&quot;

&quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;No, no... Don&#146;t be.&quot; He smirked, rising back to his feet. &quot;That&#146;s a 
bombshell though, man.&quot; He whistled low.

&quot;I know...&quot; She sighed.

&quot;Wait a minute I don&#146;t understand?&quot; He frowned and looked at her 
curiously.

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis smiled, faintly blushing.

&quot;Why the big secret, you&#146;ve never been one to hide from the truth and 
Fujin definitely seems like sort not to give a damn what people think.&quot;

&quot;Well yeah, usually she is but she thinks I could get in trouble if it 
was public.&quot;

&quot;Why!?&quot; He asked suspiciously.

&quot;Ah, well...she was my student.&quot;

&quot;WHOA!&quot; Kevin blurted loudly, sitting back down again. &quot;That is so, so 
wrong!&quot;

Quistis winced and waved her hands to calm him down.

&quot;She not anymore, she only had a refresher course to take.&quot;

Kevin rubbed his face and shook is head in disbelief.

&quot;That&#146;s tabloid material Quisty.&quot; He chuckled.

&quot;Oh shut up.&quot;

&quot;Taking advantage of your students, for shame...&quot; He chuckled.

&quot;It&#146;s not like that you louse!&quot; Quistis snapped irritably.

&quot;Calm down, I&#146;m only kidding.&quot;

&quot;Anyway, there you go, the truth.&quot; Quistis sighed with a shrug.

&quot;That&#146;s a real kick in the shorts, I still wish you told me earlier 
though.&quot;

&quot;I know, I&#146;m sorry I just didn&#146;t want to hurt your feelings. I didn&#146;t 
know what to do.&quot;

&quot;Well be thankful, your Fuji Poo sent me to see you.&quot;

&quot;Fuji Poo!?&quot; Quistis mouthed quietly before exploding into laughter.

***************************

It was early morning and Quistis&#146; class of SEED hopefuls, waited eagerly 
outside her classroom. The results of the final exam were in and 
everyone was desperate to learn who passed. Finally, Xu made her way up 
the hall, a small notepad in her hand. Everyone grew quiet and watched 
her intently. Fujin folded her arms expectantly, she was fairly certain 
she made it but she wasn&#146;t about to get cocky, that was Seifer&#146;s 
failing.

&quot;Listen up.&quot; Xu said loudly, glancing at the pad thoughtfully. &quot;The 
following people are to report to Cid&#146;s office tomorrow at 1300 Hours 
for their diploma. The rest of you will be dismissed, better luck next 
year. Now then.&quot; She paused and looked over the eager faces calmly.

&quot;Nei.&quot; Xu started blandly.

The tall young woman exhaled sharply and bent over to catch her breath.

&quot;Tex.&quot; The senior SEED continued. The young man gave a hoot and several 
of his friends congratulated him.

&quot;Aeka.&quot; Xu said softly and paused before continuing. &quot;Has been awarded 
SEED status posthumously.&quot; Everyone clapped quietly; happy to hear their 
fallen comrade had been honored.

&quot;And Finally, Rinoa, and Fujin.&quot; Xu finished and tucked the notepad 
under her arm. &quot;That is all, you are dismissed.&quot; She said firmly then 
turned to leave. A round of applause erupted from those present. Rinoa 
grabbed everyone within reach in a group hug while cheering loudly. 
Fujin artfully dodged away and headed for the elevator.

However, much to her dismay she instead came face to face with Seifer.

&quot;Hey Fu.&quot; He said quietly.

Fujin ignored him and pushed past without a word.

&quot;You made it.&quot; He called to her, not even turning around. &quot;I knew you 
would.&quot;

Fujin paused a moment, waiting for whatever snide remark he was about 
add. To her surprise, none came.

&quot;I know you could care less, but I&#146;m proud of you. Raijin would be too. 
I wish you the best of luck.&quot; He said softly, before continuing on up 
the hall.

Fujin glanced over her shoulder at him with a bitter retort on her lips. 
The urge died, she just didn&#146;t have it in her anymore, and it was time 
to move on.

&quot;THANKS.&quot; She called to him somberly, before stepping onto the elevator.

***************************

&quot;Well the year is nearly over.&quot; Cid said quietly.

&quot;Yes sir.&quot; Quistis nodded in agreement as they stood on the balcony 
outside his office. There were storm clouds in the distance and the wind 
blew the hot air about them with an eager fervor.

&quot;You did good, you&#146;re class had the highest number of SEED graduates.&quot;

&quot;Thank you sir but I couldn&#146;t have done it alone, Xu and Edea helped me 
a lot.&quot; Quistis said humbly. &quot;Besides, considering, what happened, I&#146;d 
hardly call that a success.

&quot;Don&#146;t keep beating yourself up Quistis, it&#146;s not healthy.&quot;

&quot;I know sir, but it still troubles me.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s called mourning child, its natural, we&#146;ll all come through this 
stronger than before. Besides, they&#146;ll be with us as long as we cherish 
their memory.&quot;

Quistis smiled and nodded warmly.

&quot;How&#146;s Fujin doing? Getting along well with the others? I&#146;ve not really 
had a chance to keep tabs on her.&quot;

&quot;She&#146;s doing great actually, the others have even begun to accept her.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s good to hear.&quot; Cid smiled.

&quot;But I do have a concern.&quot; She frowned.

&quot;Seifer.&quot; He sighed.

&quot;Yes, how did you know?&quot;

&quot;Squall was in here earlier. Seifer seems to be on everyone&#146;s minds.&quot;

&quot;What have you two decided.&quot;

&quot;Edea truly believed he was just a victim of Ultimecia and that we give 
him a chance.&quot;

&quot;Not to contradict her, but Siefer admitted he went along willingly, and 
then there is what he did to Fujin.&quot;

&quot;I know, I know...&quot; He sighed wearily.

&quot;I can&#146;t speak for everyone else, but as much as it annoys me Fujin is 
of the mind to just let what happened between the two of them remain in 
the past.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s odd.&quot; He scoffed.

&quot;She&#146;s beyond it all now, he could fall of the face off the planet for 
all she cares now.&quot; She explained bluntly.

&quot;You seem awfully informed, she told you all this I take it?&quot;

&quot;She trusts me, talks to me.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s good to hear. Still though, not to be crude but its marginal 
compared to what he potentially had a willing hand in.&quot;

&quot;I know, so what do you do now...?&quot;

&quot;He&#146;ll never fit in here again...&quot; He sighed sadly.

&quot;Do you believe that?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but I think it&#146;s more him than anyone else.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; She frowned curiously.

&quot;He can&#146;t forgive himself.&quot;

&quot;You think he&#146;s sorry then?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes, very much so...&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t envy you.&quot; She admitted.

&quot;It&#146;s troubling yes...but I do not think it will be a problem.&quot;

&quot;Really, why not?&quot;

&quot;I think he is planning on leaving again, and this time, I don&#146;t think 
he&#146;ll be back.&quot;

&quot;Oh...&quot; She said quietly.

&quot;You know it as well as I do, just like he does.&quot;

&quot;I know...so what then, we just let him go?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Are you okay with that?&quot; She asked gravely.

&quot;Yes and so is Squall, its time to bury the past before it consumes us. 
Let Siefer control his own fate for once.&quot; Cid said cryptically.

*************************

Fujin lay sprawled out atop Quistis&#146; bed staring at the ceiling fan in a 
near trance. Quistis sat at her desk quietly putting away her books and 
teaching supplies for the break between classes.

&quot;I told Kevin.&quot; She said quietly as she glanced over a school photo of 
her students, before the tragic events took place.

Fujin sat up and eyed her silently.

&quot;He took it well, he and the others are leaving tomorrow.&quot; Quistis 
continued, placing the photo carefully in a small box.

&quot;He said we make a cute couple.&quot; Quistis laughed lightly.

&quot;NOT CUTE.&quot; Fujin mumbled before lying back down to stare at the fan.

&quot;Do me a favor please.&quot; Quistis asked, prompting her to sit back up. 
&quot;Can you put this in the closet, in the back.&quot;

Fujin nodded and scooped up the small, brown box. Quistis finished 
straightening her desk then leaned back in her seat with a sigh.

&quot;Well that&#146;s it, the end the school season. All that&#146;s left now is the 
dance. You know, you should really should go, everyone will be there.&quot;

Fujin decided not to comment, not wanting to be baited into a discussion 
about it. Setting the box at the back of the closet she was preparing to 
leave when something caught her eye. Quistis noticed her lingering and 
spoke up.

&quot;I hope you&#146;re not rooting through my underwear again.&quot; She teased.

Fujin appeared with a quizzical look on her face a dirty magazine in 
hand, flipping candidly through the pages, full of naked and wanton 
women, Fujin couldn&#146;t help but let out a laugh.

&quot;What the?&quot; Quistis blinked, standing up.

With a grin Fujin held the book at arm&#146;s length and let the centerfold 
unfurl.

&quot;Where did you find that!?&quot; Quistis balked.

&quot;CLOSET.&quot; Fujin chuckled. &quot;WHOLE STACK.&quot;

&quot;Oh Hyne.&quot; Quistis sighed, snatching the book from her.

&quot;IS NATURAL.&quot; Fujin said cattily, folding her arms and eyeing the now 
blushing instructor.

&quot;Oh grow up.&quot; Quistis barked playfully and went into the closet.

&quot;YOU ONE, WITH BOOKS.&quot; Fujin pointed out.

Walking out with an armload of porno magazines, Quistis deposited them 
on the bed.

&quot;I confiscated them, thank you very much. A couple of students were 
selling them down by the cafeteria.&quot; She explained.

&quot;RIGHT.&quot; Fujin said knowingly, looking over the pile and giving 
accusatory looks. &quot;SO KEPT?&quot;

&quot;I was saving them.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;OBVIOUSLY.&quot; Fujin nodded with cheerful sarcasm.

&quot;Listen you...I was going to give them to Zone, I owe him one.&quot;

&quot;OF COURSE.&quot; Fujin grinned. A knock on the door quickly caused her to 
frown once more.

&quot;Get that please.&quot; Quistis sighed, as she sorted the books into neat 
piles.

Fujin returned to the bedroom with Xu right behind her. Taking one look 
at the subject matter on the bed, Xu&#146;s eyes grew big as saucers and she 
turned around.

&quot;Aw geeze... I&#146;m interrupting.&quot; She babbled awkwardly and headed back to 
the living room. Irvine, who was with her and waiting in the living room 
stood up, his curiosity piqued by the blushing woman rushing towards 
him.

&quot;We&#146;ll come back later.&quot; Xu said simply.

&quot;Oh for the love of...Xu shut up and come back here.&quot; Quistis groaned, 
walking out with the books in hand. Irvine grinned hugely at her.

&quot;You would be here...&quot; Quistis frowned at the sight of him and giving up 
all hope of retaining any dignity in the matter.

&quot;Beaver Parade, Gazaongas, Smut hut?&quot; Irvine read off curiously, eyeing 
the magazines. &quot;Nice collection Quisty, remind me to bring mine over, we 
can trade.&quot;

&quot;I hate all of you.&quot; Quistis hissed sourly, setting the pile on the 
coffee table. Tickled by the growing scandal Fujin inadvertently let out 
a girlish giggle and quickly became the center of attention.

&quot;What the hell was that?&quot; Irvine blinked, staring at her.&quot;

&quot;GOING.&quot; She blurted, and hurried out the door.

&quot;Bye.&quot; Quistis called out quickly as she exited.

Xu was lost, and confused but learned not to ask questions. Irvine on 
the other loved every minute of it.

&quot;What&#146;s going on?&quot; He asked with a lewd grin.

&quot;Shut up, just shut up, these are for Zone, I owe him one, its that 
simple.&quot; Quistis explained, one last time. Irvine frowned in dismay.

&quot;Oh, well hell, that&#146;s boring.&quot;

&quot;What do you two want, besides to torment me?

&quot;Well we, were talking, about the wedding and all.&quot; Irvine said, 
gesturing to Xu who had large art book in her hands.

&quot;Yeah...?&quot; Quistis murmured cautiously, still wondering if this was 
leading to some kind of joke.

&quot;Well Selphie is out with the girls, celebrating the graduation.&quot;

&quot;Oh by the way how&#146;d Celest do, did she make SEED?&quot; Quistis asked 
curiously.

&quot;Yeah she did.&quot; Xu nodded.

&quot;Good.&quot; Quistis smiled.

&quot;Anyway.&quot; Irvine grinned and took the book from Xu and flipped through 
it. &quot;Aha here we go.&quot; He said turning the book so Quistis could see.

&quot;What&#146;s this?

&quot;Well with the girls gone and being bored I got together with Xu to help 
come up with some ideas for the bridesmaids gowns.

&quot;You&#146;re joking.&quot; Quistis laughed.

&quot;No he&#146;s serious.&quot; Xu sighed.

Quistis looked down, the drawings were crude, color pencil renderings 
but the point was made and Quistis immediately shook her head.

&quot;No way I&#146;m going to be seen in that.&quot; She said flatly.

&quot;I tried to tell him it&#146;s a wedding not a bachelor party.&quot; Xu said, 
giving Irvine a foul look as she took the book and flipped the pages.

&quot;Now here are my ideas.&quot; The young woman said eagerly. Similarly, the 
pictures were crude, but this time they where more fashionable. Still, 
Quistis wasn&#146;t terrible happy with the idea.

&quot;Um guys I though Celest was the resident fashion mogul.&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#146;t mean we can&#146;t offer suggestions, I always wanted to try my 
hand at fashion, what do ya think?&quot; Xu exclaimed eagerly.

&quot;Well... Okay look, going to be blunt... No...&quot; Quistis said with an 
understanding, yet awkward smile.

&quot;Oh come on! We worked all morning on this.&quot; Xu frowned.

&quot;Hey now, why are you even asking me anyway? Selphie is the one to that 
has to choose.&quot; Quistis said defensively.

Irvine and Xu exchanged glances and Irvine looked sheepishly.

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis asked darkly.

&quot;Well Quisty, seeing you&#146;re the oldest, she felt you um...kinda fill the 
role of matriarch, therefore in charge of the arrangements.&quot; He grinned 
nervously.

&quot;Matriarch?&quot; Quistis babbled crassly. &quot;What the hell is that supposed to 
mean!?&quot;

&quot;It means older female.&quot; Xu chirped.

&quot;I know what definition means!&quot; Quistis barked.

&quot;Look, Quisty, she respects you, she knows you won&#146;t screw it up, that 
and she thought you&#146;d be honored.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, honored.&quot; Xu frowned expectantly at her.

&quot;Oh...well...alright.&quot; Quistis said quietly.

&quot;Great, now then, we&#146;ve other drawings.&quot; Xu grinned, flipping through 
the book some more.

*******************

A pipe, easily fifteen feet across hung shattered and spewing untold 
gallons of boiling hot water into a murky shaft. Two men stood staring 
transfixed at the twisted wreckage the broken pipe caused.

&quot;So what the hell happened!?&quot; Squall shouted over the roaring hiss of 
steam and rushing water. A mature man, rural by looks, gruff and moody 
by actions looked at him in annoyance.

&quot;Welp the pipe, she went and burst.&quot; The man said in a thick backwater 
accent.

&quot;I can see that.&quot; Squall sighed. &quot;How, and how bad will this effect our 
operations, do we need to land?&quot;

&quot;Well, I reckon you could.&quot;

&quot;Good, then get this fixed as soon as possible.&quot; Squall started.

&quot;Of course, the engines&#146;ll cook an we blow sky high.&quot; The man continued, 
gnawing on an old matchstick.

&quot;Damn.&quot; Squall growled and slipped a walkie-talkie out of his belt.

&quot;Nida!&quot; he shouted over the steam.

&quot;Yeah boss.&quot; Balamb&#146;s pilot answered dully.

&quot;Set us down.&quot;

&quot;We&#146;re, um over a ocean.&quot;

&quot;It can&#146;t be helped, set us down and turn off the engines.&quot;

&quot;Um, you do know we&#146;ll only have reserve power if I do that.&quot;

&quot;I know, just do it, we&#146;ve got a situation down in the core.&quot;

&quot;What kind of situation?&quot;

Squall looked over at the grease covered mechanic glaring at him.

&quot;Maintenance issues, I&#146;ll explain when I get topside.&quot;

&quot;Okay, you&#146;re the captain.&quot;

&quot;Cute...&quot;

Suddenly the entire garden shifted slightly and all went quiet. The 
deluge of water quickly died down to a mild trickle. With an audible 
click the lights throughout the Garden blinked a moment then came back 
on.

&quot;Any hope of getting this fixed before reserve power dies?&quot; Squall asked 
hopefully.

&quot;No at all.&quot; The man chuckled sourly, then spit down into the shaft.

&quot;Wonderful, do you know what caused it?&quot;

&quot;Place is a mess, support prolly rusted.&quot; She man drawled.

&quot;Rusted...you guys are supposed to be on top of this kind of thing.&quot; 
Squall said angrily.

&quot;Place is huge fella, and I got limited man power, hell I still ain&#146;t 
replaced the one who died down here.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;People don&#146;t want to work down here, it&#146;s potential deathtrap, what 
with the weird shenanigans going on to make it work. Magic and what not, 
man have to be crazy to work down here, m not even gonna talk bout the 
critters still roamin around.&quot;

&quot;We cleared the monsters out of the core over a year ago.&quot; Squall 
scowled.

&quot;Yeah well all I know is something&#146;s been eating the rats, hell we 
haven&#146;t even seen or heard any in weeks.&quot;

&quot;Rats...Look worry about fixing this mess. If you guys see some so 
called critter call us and we&#146;ll deal with it.&quot;

&quot;Yeah easy for you to say, assuming it don&#146;t go eat us first.&quot;

&quot;Look...&quot; Squall started then looked at the embroidered name on the 
man&#146;s jumpsuit. &quot;Horace. You guys have a suck job I know, but it is your 
job. If the place is getting to you take a vacation.&quot;

&quot;Bah, get out of here.&quot; Horace snapped as he started climbing a ladder 
to a catwalk far above.

&quot;Whatever, call me when it gets done.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot;

*********************************

Zell, Watts, Zone and Kevin were sitting on the steps leading down to 
the recreation plaza when the Garden lurched slightly. Zone immediately 
belched and groaned softly.

&quot;Aw hell man, what&#146;s with you.&quot; Zell grumbled scooting away from him. A 
trio of young woman bounded down the steps past them and Watts smiled 
appreciatively.

&quot;One smiled at me.&quot; He sighed.

&quot;Humpf.&quot; Zone gurgled in aggravation.

&quot;This place bounce around like that often?&quot; Kevin asked, looking out at 
the approaching storm clouds.

&quot;Not really, looks like we&#146;re landing though.&quot; Zell noted, standing up 
to get a better view.

&quot;We&#146;re in the ocean!&quot; Zone blurted worriedly.

&quot;Calm down, the place floats.&quot; Zell chuckled.

&quot;Still, I&#146;ve sensitive bowels.&quot;

Zell&#146;s face screwed up and he glanced at Zone sourly.

&quot;No one wants to hear about you&#146;re bowels again.&quot; Watts sighed.

&quot;No one asked you.&quot; Zone snapped back then hiccuped.

&quot;Guys.&quot; Kevin sighed, rubbing his temples.

&quot;Oh yeah...&quot; Zell grinned curiously. &quot;You never told us what happened.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Kevin blinked.

&quot;Between you and Miss Trepe.&quot; Zell prodded.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Hey that&#146;s right, you left together after that critter attacked you.&quot; 
Watts smirked.

&quot;Lucky.&quot; Zone grumbled.

&quot;No, nothing happened.&quot; Kevin blushed.

&quot;I don&#146;t buy it man, your buddies here told me that you&#146;d been chasing 
her big time.&quot; Zell huffed expectantly.

&quot;He was Sir.&quot; Watts nodded.

&quot;See.&quot; Zell laughed.

&quot;We talked.&quot; Kevin said simply.

&quot;Well, what did she say. Personally I think you and her would be good. 
From what I remember you guys used to be tight.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#146;t like that.&quot;

&quot;How was it then?&quot; Zone asked humorlessly.

&quot;I&#146;m not about to sit here and be interrogated. Nothing happened, we 
talked for a bit is all.&quot;

&quot;Did you ask her out Sir?&quot; Watts asked brightly.

&quot;I thought about it, but as then I realized that I&#146;ve changed a lot.&quot;

&quot;What&#146;s that supposed to mean?&quot; Zone frowned.

&quot;Oh boy, here it comes.&quot; Zell chuckled.

&quot;I don&#146;t think she&#146;s my type anymore.&quot; Kevin shrugged.

&quot;He&#146;s full of it. She shot him down.&quot; Zone snorted.

&quot;Ouch.&quot; Zell winced.

&quot;Sorry Sir, you tried.&quot; Watts sighed.

&quot;Just drop it.&quot; Kevin said, rolling his eyes.

&quot;Like she did you.&quot; Zone huffed under his breath with a sly grin.

&quot;Allright now, go easy on the guy, he&#146;s trying to save face.&quot; Zell 
smirked.

&quot;There&#146;s other fish in the sea sir.&quot; Watts offered.

&quot;Ugh.&quot; Was all the reply Kevin could offer.

*****************

&quot;I can&#146;t believe they let you take this thing out.&quot; Celest shouted to 
Rinoa over the crashing waves. The high-speed sea transport was an ugly 
military beast but is was a thrill to ride in and had more than enough 
room to store the booty the girls gathered on their shopping spree.

&quot;Hey we&#146;re official now, so we get the perks.&quot; Rinoa giggled excitedly.

&quot;Well Miss official, slow down before I harf all over the place.&quot; 
Selphie groaned.

&quot;Epp sorry!&quot; Rinoa squeaked, slowing the hydrofoil to a less stomach 
turning speed.

&quot;Hey guys...&quot; Nicole asked, looking around, the sky was dimming as 
nightfall descended and a storm was fast approaching.

&quot;What&#146;s up Nikki.&quot; Selphie chirped.

&quot;That storm is getting closer and I don&#146;t see Balamb anywhere.&quot; She said 
answered worriedly.

&quot;It&#146;s sunset, they should be around here somewhere.&quot; Rinoa frowned, 
looking up from the computer navigation system.

&quot;I found them.&quot; Selphie said, glancing at the scanners.

&quot;Where are they?&quot; Celest asked curiously.

&quot;Looks like they&#146;re adrift, about twenty miles north.&quot;

&quot;Adrift? I wonder if something happened.&quot; Rinoa said with sense of 
dread.

&quot;You guys calm down, I&#146;ll give them a holler.&quot; Celest laughed, picking 
up the radio.

&quot;Balmb Garden this is Ocean 3 over.&quot; She said mechanically.

&quot;Hi ladies.&quot; Nida&#146;s voice crackled weakly over the receiver.

&quot;What&#146;s your situation, we notice you&#146;re late. Get pulled over?&quot;

&quot;Funny, no, coolant pipe ruptured in the core or something, We had to 
land until its fixed.&quot;

&quot;Coolant pipe?&quot; Nicole balked.

&quot;That&#146;s sounds awfully bad, is everyone okay.&quot; Celest asked fearfully.

&quot;Oh yeah, we&#146;re fine but we&#146;re on backup power until we can start the 
engines again.&quot;

&quot;Okay, we&#146;ll rendezvous with you then.&quot;

&quot;Alright, but hurry up the water is getting choppy and that storm is 
about on top of us.&quot;

&quot;Will do. See you soon.&quot; Celest smirked, then set the radio down as she 
looked at the other girls. &quot;See what happens, we leave for a few hours 
and everything falls apart.&quot; She chuckled.

*************************

It wasn&#146;t long after the sunset the storm hit full force. Balamb&#146;s rode 
the storm well enough but not without making half the population on 
board seasick. Cid and Squall ordered all non-essentials shut off to 
conserve power. And so, Balamb Garden went dark and quiet, leaving the 
occupants with only the sounds of the raging storm to keep them 
occupied.

Quistis lay on her bed reading a book by candlelight, Irvine and Xu had 
left not long after the lights went out. Fujin was no where to be seen 
and Quistis hoped she was beginning to think she may have been stranded 
in her quarters. She heard the sounds of children running up the halls 
outside her apartment, they were laughing and making ghost sounds. 
Smiling fondly Quistis listened for a moment, remembering back when she 
and her friends did similar mischief.

The sound of the front door opening alerted her and she leaned over to 
see out into the living room. A loud thud and a curse signaled Fujin had 
made it to her in one piece.

&quot;QUISTIS?&quot; Fujin called quietly into the darkness.

&quot;I&#146;m in the bedroom hon.&quot;

&quot;ANNOYING.&quot; Fujin grumbled, rubbing her shin.

&quot;I know, hopefully things will be up and running soon. Did you hear what 
happened?&quot; Quistis asked as she brought the candle to the bedroom door 
so Fujin could find her way.

&quot;STUCK.&quot; Fujin said gruffly as she neared.

&quot;I thought so, how did you get out? With the Elevator down.&quot;

&quot;MAINTENANCE LADDER.&quot; Fujin answered as Quistis stole a welcoming kiss.

&quot;GOOD MOOD?&quot; Fujin smirked fondly.

&quot;I missed you. You left so quick, everything okay?&quot;

Fujin nodded as the two of them sat down in the center of the bed.

&quot;READING?&quot; Fujin queried, nodding to the book sitting nearby.

&quot;Fires of eternity. It&#146;s a classic.&quot; Quistis smiled, showing her the 
cover.

&quot;MOTHER READ TO ME.&quot; Fujin remembered with a quiet smile.

&quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;ALL TIME.&quot;

&quot;That must be nice.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot;

&quot;To have memories of your parents. Your mother at least.&quot;

&quot;SOMETIMES.&quot;

&quot;You want to borrow it, I&#146;m almost done.&quot;

&quot;THANK YOU.&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot; Quistis grinned, then looked at her softly, her skin aglow 
in the candlelight. &quot;I missed you.&quot; She said quietly, leaning forward to 
caress her cheek. Blushing under the attention Fujin looked down shyly. 
Quistis lifted her chin with delicate fingers and gazed silently at her. 
Fujin&#146;s gaze met hers and she smiled sweetly, then wordlessly, she 
scooted closer letting and slipped her arms around Quistis&#146; waist.

The storm was a soothing backdrop as they made love, and for the first 
time in seemingly long while, they were able to simply enjoy each 
other&#146;s company.</pre>
