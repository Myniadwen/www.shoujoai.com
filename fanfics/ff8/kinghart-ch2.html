<p>Secrets Written in  Blood</p>
<p>            Quistis  felt infinitely more comfortable when Xu was around. She knew that Xu would be  there if she ever got into trouble and needed to talk. Of course being the  Quistis that she was, she never talked about her problems but knowing that  someone was there to listen was almost as good. She flopped down on the bed and  sighed.</p>
<p>            “You  feeling all right Quisty?” Xu asked as she exited the bathroom with an  unflattering foamy mouth as she continued brushing her teeth. Quistis couldn’t  help but let out a choked laugh.</p>
<p>            “Um…”  Giggle. “Xu” Laugh. “You might want to look in the” Cough. “Mirror.” Xu raised  a questioning eyebrow and turned back to the bathroom before erupting into  laughter that sent toothpaste flying every which way. She quickly rinsed the  toothpaste from her mouth and washed her face.</p>
<p>            “That was  mean.” She said crossly flopping down on the bed beside her.</p>
<p>            “But  funny.” Quistis pointed out. Xu shoved her off the bed. “Hey! That was mean!”  Xu stuck out her tongue.</p>
<p>            “Payback.”  She replied, smiling. She looked at her drawer and saw a picture. It was a  picture of her and Quistis when they were little. She picked it up and studied  it. “You were so cute back then. I wonder what happened…” Quistis glared at her  angrily and snatched the picture out of her hands.</p>
<p>            “Same goes  for you too.” She sat down on the bed again and looked around. “Balamb hasn’t  quieted down. Even if Ultimecia is defeated, she’s defeated in the future. Who  knows when she’ll rise in this time.” <em>Kill…</em>Quistis jumped, her eyes  wide.</p>
<p>            “Quisty?”  Xu said, sitting up as well.</p>
<p>            “Who?” Quistis  stood up and opened her window and looked out. “Did you hear something?” Xu  scratched her head.</p>
<p>            “It was a  disembodied voice that reached into the depths of your mind and sucked out all  the sanity, leaving you questioning what is real and what is not. I might not  be real for all you know.” She whispered spookily.</p>
<p>            “That’s not  funny.” Quistis snapped, clearly aggravated by how close her answer came. “I’m  serious, I heard something.”</p>
<p>            “And what  was that something?” Xu asked, humored by all of this. Quistis crossed her arms  and stomped her foot like a child.</p>
<p>            “It was a  voice ok?” Xu stood up and walked over to her, putting her arms on her  shoulders.</p>
<p>            “You…need…sleep…”  she said, accenting every single word. “It…is…driving…you…insane…” Quistis  sighed and decided that she was right, no matter how much she didn’t want to  admit it. She lay down on the bed and closed her eyes, placing her palm on her  forehead.</p>
<p>            “Yeah…sleep.”  She whispered hauntingly.</p>
<p>            “Either  that or there’s something on your mind and the only way to cure it is by  telling me exactly what’s troubling you.” Quistis frowned at her friend’s eager  attempt to wrestle information out of her. “Maybe Shiva’s playing with your  mind?” It wasn’t that either. Shiva definitely didn’t play around like that. She  was above silly tricks like that. On top of that, Shiva sounded more  comforting. Never in the years that she had Shiva junctioned did she ever sound  like that. Sure, the GF sounded cold at times but not down right sinister.</p>
<p>            “No…never  mind. It’ll go away, I’m sure of it. Maybe I’m just hearing things.” But the  voice had left chills up and down her spine. She shivered. Xu climbed into bed  beside her, a little worried.</p>
<p>            “I’m sure  it will. Goodnight, Quistis.” She turned off the antique lamp on the desk beside  the bed and grabbed most of the covers. Quistis yanked them back and they  fought over control of the covers before the entire activity wore them out and  they went to sleep without another incident. Xu lost anyway.</p>

<p>            Xu woke up in  the middle of the night. She groaned and stood up, going towards the kitchen  for a glass of water. She searched through the darkness, finding drawers that  clearly weren’t for holding glasses. She opened one drawer filled with  different objects of miniscule use and was about to close it before something  in the back glinted. Curiosity and drowsiness motivated her to check it out.</p>
<p>            It was a  cutter.</p>
<p>            It was a  cutter with dried blood on it.</p>
<p>            Xu froze,  fully awakened by the object. She looked back at the lump on the bed and felt  her heart sink painfully. What if…no…Quistis wouldn’t do that would she? She  gripped the cutter, feeling the sudden urge to destroy it. Still, what if  Quistis really was that depressed. She rarely said anything about her feelings.  It was clearly strict SeeD behavior that pushed Quistis to hide her feelings.  She crept over to Quistis. Even her sleeping form was troubled and she wanted  to banish the evil thought that lurked in her mind. But since it simply  wouldn’t go away, she gently removed some of the covers and peered through the  darkness at her lithe arms. Xu’s eyes watered. There were scars, clean scars  that could only be made by something like a cutter. They were too small to be  made by a gunblade and too thin to be made by her whip or any animal’s claws.</p>
<p>            “Quisty…”  she whispered, slumping to the ground. “It can’t be…” Xu wished that she hadn’t  discovered the cutter. She opened the window and threw the cutter out as far as  she could. Then, she turned back to Quistis and looked at her sadly. “Why won’t  you talk? I’m always here…”</p>
