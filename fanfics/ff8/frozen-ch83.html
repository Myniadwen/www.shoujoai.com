&quot;Fujin wait!&quot; Ellone called out as Fujin all but ran through the halls. 
Raijin too gave chase, as did Zell and Nicole.

&quot;Where is she going?&quot; Raijin called, jogging to catch up with the 
entourage.

&quot;Who knows.&quot; Zell groaned, still at a loss as to what was going on.

Upon arriving at Quistis classroom Fujin paused. It was after hours and 
the room was locked tight. With a swift kick, Fujin bashed the door in, 
sending it crashing to the floor. Alarms immediately went off but she 
ignored them and hurried to the computer terminal behind Quistis desk.

&quot;Hey! I had a key you know.&quot; Zell frowned, poking his head in the room 
cautiously.

&quot;Fujin, what are you doing?&quot; Ellone asked, moving to peer over shoulder.

&quot;SILENCE.&quot; Fujin snapped, trying to concentrate as she scanned through 
various files.

&quot;Wha?&quot; Raijin started, but a gesture from Nicole silenced him.

After a few tense moments Fujin finally looked up with a determined 
look.

&quot;SUSPICION.&quot; She frowned.

&quot;What?&quot; Ellone asked.

&quot;COMA, GUARDIANS.&quot;

&quot;What about it?&#39; Zell asked.

&quot;THEIR FAULT!&quot; Fujin blurted.

&quot;That&#39;s impossible, if she&#39;d been possessed, one of them would be in 
control, like Griever and Luccian.&quot; Nicole frowned, earning a few 
surprised looks. &quot;Hey, I may not be a SEED but I keep up with stuff.&quot; 
She explained.

&quot;Nikki&#39;s right Fu.&quot; Zell agreed grimly.

&quot;NOT POSSESSED.&quot; Fujin sighed, jumping to her feet.

Raijin looked thoroughly confused, as did Ellone.

&quot;Wanna clue us in here?&quot; He asked in exasperation.

Fujin growled and pointed to the monitor on Quistis&#39; desk where a brief 
explanation of how Guardians were bound their hosts was displayed.

&quot;Okay, lemmi see.&quot; Ellone sighed, looking over the report. She had just 
finished and was about to comment when a small army of security guards 
stormed into the room.

&quot;Everybody freeze!&quot; The lead guard shouted, raising his weapon.

&quot;Aw geeze Keith, stow that thing before you hurt somebody.&quot; Zell 
groaned, motioning him to lower the weapon.

&quot;Um sorry, sir, err what&#39;s going on here?&quot;

&quot;Problem with the door, it&#39;s cool.&quot; Zell explained, sending them on 
their way. Everyone waited for them to clear out before turning back to 
face Ellone and Fujin.

&quot;Where were we?&quot; Raijin asked.

&quot;Fujin, I&#39;ll be the first to admit that I know next to nothing about 
Guardians, but I don&#39;t see the relevance of this.&quot; Ellone frowned, 
glancing down at the monitor again. &quot;

&quot;AEKA.&quot; Fujin said. &quot;EXPLAINED.&quot;

&quot;Aeka?&quot; Raijin wondered aloud.

&quot;Long story.&quot; Nicole told him quietly.

&quot;You girls seeing ghosts?&quot; Zell asked warily.

&quot;SHUT UP.&quot; Fujin snarled at him.

&quot;Okay now, let&#39;s be civil.&quot; Nicole said peaceably.

&quot;SOMEHOW, GUARDIANS, TRAPPED.&quot; Fujin continued.

&quot;You mean to tell me, Aeka... told you that Shiva and Leviathan are 
trapped in Miss Trepe?&quot; Zell said with a hint of doubt.

&quot;Not in so many words.&quot; Ellone explained, seemingly starting to get a 
grasp of what Fujin was trying to explain. &quot;But this Aeka person said 
they were free too. She seems to be contradicting herself.&quot;

&quot;TROUBLESOME.&quot; Fujin agreed.

&quot;Guys, I hate to bring this up, but Quistis shouldn&#39;t be bonded with any 
Guardians.&quot;

&quot;What, why not&quot; Ellone asked.

&quot;Well...&quot; Zell paused and looked to Fujin solemnly. &quot;Um Fu, you don&#39;t 
know this but when we found you guys... We lost Quistis while trying to 
get her out of the rubble.&quot; He said quietly. Fujin looked as if she were 
about to faint. &quot;She was gone only a moment, we were able to resuscitate 
her pretty quick. You see, the thing is; later, when Doctor Kadowaki 
stabilized her, we went to remove the Guardians and nothing happened, 
they were gone. We assumed they left when she died...like normal.&quot;

&quot;MISTAKEN.&quot; Fujin said with quiet intensity.

&quot;Look, it&#39;s easy, we just draw them out now then, piece of cake ya 
know!&quot; Raijin blurted cheerfully.

&quot;NOT SO EASY.&quot; Fujin frowned.

&quot;Why not?&quot;

Fujin pointed to the monitor again and Ellone leaned forward to read 
aloud.

&quot;Ahem.&quot; She started in a scholarly tone. &quot;Guardians bond with the host 
by merging themselves in the hosts subconscious, primitive mind. As the 
Guardian&#39;s link strengthens and its bonds grow, the energy of the 
Guardian expands further into the host&#39;s mind, namely regions that 
contain long term memory. The reasons for this is twofold, firstly the 
Guardian thrives on experiencing the world through something it lacks, 
organic substance. Secondly it&#39;s growth is structured to grow along less 
used segments of memory, so that there is less of a chance of harming 
the host. This overlapping is what causes memory loss, as the Guardian&#39;s 
presence suppresses that part of the mind it&#39;s energy contacts.&quot; Ellone 
read aloud then paused to look at everyone in disbelief.

&quot;You all do this?&quot; She gawked in horror.

&quot;Do what?&quot; Zell asked, somewhat taken aback.

&quot;Bond with these things. Sounds to me like a bad idea...&quot;

&quot;Only when we need to...&quot; Zell grumbled, not liking the look she was 
giving them.

&quot;CONTINUE.&quot; Fujin snapped eagerly, tapping on the monitor in earnest.

&quot;Okay, okay, where was I?&quot; Ellone sighed, glancing through the text. 
&quot;Okay, here we go. Anyway, The Guardians instinctively seek out 
potentially interesting but older memories when bonding so as to not 
cause undo harm. Once established, the guardian is locked in place and 
cannot normally move to another area unless it is altogether removed 
from the host. The memory loss, while disconcerting is mostly temporary 
and in general, memories return in time, depending on how long the 
guardian has been present. It has been noted that when the host dies, 
the Guardians will abandon the host rapidly in order to return to whence 
they came.&quot; She finished dully and still not sure what purpose reading 
it again solved. &quot;If there is something in this, I&#39;m not seeing it.&quot;

Fujin looked nearly ecstatic.

&quot;MAKES SENSE NOW!&quot; She said, looking to Zell.

&quot;What do you mean? I figured you had a clue as to what to do.&quot; He 
grinned, somewhat awkwardly.

&quot;DID, BUT YOU CONFIRMED.&quot;

&quot;I did?&quot; He said in wide-eyed confusion.

&quot;I think I get it.&quot; Ellone breathed.

&quot;TRAPPED!&quot; Fujin said eagerly. &quot;WHILE LEAVING, TRAPPED.&quot;

&quot;When?&quot; Nicole asked, trying to keep up.

&quot;NEARLY DIED.&quot;

&quot;The guardians, they were leaving Quistis when she died. Then, she was 
resuscitated, they got snagged while leaving. So now they are locked 
down, but in the wrong place.&quot; Ellone said with an optimistic glee.

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE!&quot; Fujin smiled, hope gleaming.

&quot;So um what&#39;s that mean?&quot; Raijin asked, barely comprehending any of it.

&quot;They think Quisty has um...forgotten how to...think?&quot; Nicole said, 
trying to hazard a guess.

Fujin made a face and looked to Ellone in hopes she could explain it far 
more eloquently than she could.

&quot;Um basically, if I&#39;m reading it right...&quot; Ellone smiled. &quot;It&#39;s the same 
way that these things cause memory loss by moving into areas with 
memory.&quot;

&quot;So what you&#39;re saying is that these lil guys are someplace they 
shouldn&#146;t be.&quot; Raijin huffed.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Ellone shrugged.

&quot;Well then, like I said, we draw them out ya know.&quot;

&quot;CANNOT.&quot; Fujin said, once again dashing his suggestion.

&quot;And why not?&quot; Raijin asked, yet again.

&quot;UNKNOWN LOCATION.&quot; Fujin answered.

&quot;It&#39;s a basic principle of magic.&quot; Zell grinned, cutting Raijin a 
mocking look.

&quot;Oh yeah, you skipped class that day. Basically, magic is stored in 
specific areas, same thing with Guardian&#39;s. Training teaches us to zero 
in mentally to these areas when drawing out the energy. Trick is, that 
if Fu is right, these guardians are in a place we aren&#39;t trained to zero 
in on which is normally memory.&quot;

Fujin&#39;s expression darkened and Ellone noticed it immediately.

&quot;I UNDERSTAND...&quot; Fujin said frightfully.

&quot;What?&quot; Ellone asked quietly.

&quot;AEKA SAID.&quot;

&quot;When?&quot;

&quot;SAID FREE.&quot;

&quot;What, When that howling stopped?&quot;

Fujin nodded.

&quot;What about it, what did she mean?&quot;

&quot;GUARDIAN, NOT LOCKED.&quot; Fujin said, her voice cracked and tense.

&quot;They&#39;re roaming Quistis&#39; mind then?&quot;

&quot;LOST.&quot;

&quot;Oh whoa, that&#146;s not a good thing!&quot; Zell stammered as the realization 
hit him.

&quot;Really, they&#39;ll just make things worse as they move around, the effect 
of their passage will spread faster than it&#39;ll wear off!&quot; Nicole whined.

&quot;So this is really, really bad?&quot; Raijin frowned.

Everyone just glared at him hotly.

**************************

The sun was setting, bathing the room with muted tones of red and 
orange. Music played echoed loudly through the small apartment, bathing 
its lone occupant in gritty, rustic melodies of bass guitar and drums. A 
woman&#39;s voice merged seamlessly with the music, her style of singing 
bringing to mind cigars, hard liquor and the earthy feel of old country 
bars. It was in this setting that Celest chased away her troubles. 
Staring dully staring into space, she sat quietly absorbing the sullen, 
gravely tunes with a bottle of unidentified spirits in hand.

Xu was of little help, she considered talking to Nicole about the 
disaster with Seifer but knew she&#39;d only get a; I told you so.

&quot;Shit.&quot; She grumbled, tossing the bottle against a far wall, sending 
broken glass and spilled liquor flying.

&quot;Great, that was mature.&quot; She sighed, getting up to clean up the mess. 
Grabbing a handful of paper towels from the kitchen she blotted up the 
spilled liquid, being mindful of broken glass. A knock on the door 
resounded insistently over the blaring music and she turned head to 
stare venomously at it. Having little desire to entertain guests she 
ignored it.

Whoever it was refused to be ignored the knock sounded again, this time 
even louder.

&quot;Go away!&quot; She grunted, disposing of the broken glass and wet towels.

Again, more knocking, this time with such force that it shook the 
doorframe.

&quot;Damn it.&quot; She hissed, rushing forward and yanking the door open. 
&quot;What!&#39;

Seifer greeted her with a sour expression.

&quot;Oh hell, just go away, you made your point.&quot; She groaned, slamming the 
door in his face. He shoved his hand in the way and the door bounced off 
his fingers painfully but he ignored it.

&quot;Xu sent me.&quot; He droned.

&quot;That&#146;s cute, go the hell away.&quot; She growled.

&quot;Nice.&quot; Seifer huffed in return. &quot;She said you&#39;re bent out of shape 
about last night. That somehow I was responsible or something.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s none of her business.&quot;

&quot;Then why&#39;d you tell her?&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s my business.&quot;

&quot;True.&quot; He grinned, walking over to the stereo. Poking around a moment 
he silenced it then turned to face the scowling woman.

&quot;I was listening to that.&quot; She snapped.

&quot;So was everyone in Balamb, last time I heard, there was a noise 
ordinance.&quot;

&quot;What do you care, you on the disciplinary committee?&quot;

&quot;Used to be.&quot; He chuckled.

&quot;Bastard.&quot;

&quot;That too.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re infuriating.&quot;

&quot;So I&#39;ve been told.&quot;

&quot;Why are you here.&quot; She sighed in exasperation. &quot;You come to gloat or 
just to torment me further?&quot;

&quot;Neither, get your coat.&quot; He smirked, plopping down on the couch.

&quot;I&#39;m not going anywhere with you.&quot;

&quot;Alright then, sit in here and brood, I don&#39;t care.&quot; He shrugged, then 
stood.

&quot;What?&quot; She blinked.

&quot;Hey, I&#39;m not about to beg you. You don&#39;t want to go, that&#146;s you&#39;re 
decision.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; She frowned, in confusion.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; He grinned again, looking over his shoulder at her.

&quot;Where...where are we going?&quot; She asked guardedly, somewhat intrigued by 
his actions.

&quot;I&#39;m doing something I don&#39;t normally do.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; She asked, folding her arms expectantly. &quot;What, apologize?&quot;

Seifer laughed. &quot;Hardly, I&#39;ve done nothing wrong. You&#39;re the one who 
made an ass of yourself. I&#39;m giving you a second chance.&quot;

&quot;Screw you, you conceited prick.&quot; She glared indignantly.

&quot;Come on, let&#39;s be nice. I figure we both started out on the wrong foot. 
Let&#39;s try again.&quot;

&quot;Why the hell should I?&quot;

&quot;Well.&quot; He said thoughtfully. &quot;Because I have to admit you&#39;re 
interesting, snappy, intelligent, funny.&quot; He counted aloud, causing her 
to blush. &quot;And you have a great rack.&quot; He finished with wolfish grin. 
Celest&#39;s blushing grin melted into a look of annoyance.

&quot;Pig.&quot; She spat.

&quot;But and honest one.&quot; Seifer smiled with boyish charm.

&quot;You&#39;re disgusting.&quot;

&quot;Is that a yes?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Okay, try this then. Come out with me, we&#39;ll have fun, hit the clubs, 
see the sights and in the process, drive all you&#39;re loving friends 
insane. They hate me you know.&quot;

&quot;All the more reason to say no.&quot;

&quot;That didn&#39;t stop you before.&quot; He chuckled.

&quot;I was confused.&quot; She mumbled self-consciously.

&quot;Aw poor girl.&quot; He awed sarcastically. &quot;Well it&#39;s an easy choice this 
time. Stay cooped up in here sulking, or go out and have some fun.&quot;

Celest stared at him hotly then grabbed her coat in a fervor.

&quot;Fine!&quot; She blurted angrily then strode out the door.

&quot;Thought so.&quot; He grinned, following her out.

*********************

&quot;What is this called again.&quot; Jaya asked in quiet awe, sitting just 
inches away from the television.

&quot;It&#39;s a TV.&quot; Xu laughed aloud. &quot;Where in the world are you guys from!?&quot; 
She asked, gently leading Jaya to the couch.

&quot;Our people move from place to place. We&#39;re what you would call Nomads.&quot; 
Miguel explained. &quot;Forgive my sister, she is not as worldly as I. She 
has only been away from home for some short months.&quot;

&quot;Sounds like gypsies to me.&quot; Nida said chattily as he walked into the 
den from the kitchen carrying bowls of chips and dip.

&quot;I bet the flight over was a adventure then?&quot; Xu grinned.

&quot;Very much so, it was, frightening, but I have been in such craft a few 
times before. But this place, this place is amazing... Such things, 
beyond imagination.&quot; Jaya breathed, sniffing the dip questioningly.

&quot;Who was that that called awhile ago?&quot; Nida asked, kicking back 
comfortably.

&quot;Oh, it was something about Zell. They&#39;re tearing up stuff again. I&#39;m 
off today, so let someone else deal with it.&quot; Xu giggled.

&quot;Thank you for inviting us over. Raijin is busy with his sibling and I 
fear poor Jaya was about to go stir crazy.&quot; Miguel said graciously.

&quot;No prob. As for Ray, well, his sister is having a tough time right now, 
I&#39;m sure he doesn&#39;t mean to ignore you Jaya.&quot;

&quot;I understand.&quot; Jaya smiled, nibbling contently on a bean paste covered 
chip.

&quot;I have heard you this place during my travels. You are the ones who 
vanquished the reincarnation of the dark witch yes?&quot;

&quot;Um, well if you mean the Sorceress, then yeah, sorta. Though not me 
personally. It was Squall, you haven&#39;t met him yet, and some of the 
others.

&quot;Very brave.&quot; Jaya nodded.

&quot;Indeed.&quot; Miguel smiled richly. &quot;Now then, let us watch.&quot; He started 
then picked up a case from one of the several movies Xu rented. &quot;Zombie 
love affair from the great beyond?&quot; He mumbled, then looked at Jaya as 
if he&#39;d eaten something bad.

&quot;Oh relax, trust me, it&#39;s a good movie, it&#39;s a love story.&quot; Xu beamed. 
Nida however hunkered down in his seat and rolled his eyes, it was going 
to be a long night.

****************************

&quot;Absolutely not!&quot; Kadowaki said firmly.

&quot;MUST.&quot; Fujin growled.

&quot;Come on Doc, it&#39;s the only shot we have!&quot; Zell argued.

&quot;These experiments have gone on long enough. It&#39;s detrimental to all 
involved. The incident this afternoon should&#39;ve showed you that.&quot;

&quot;NO RIGHT!&quot; Fujin protested, growing angrier by the second.

&quot;I have every right, as Chief medical officer as well as Miss Trepe&#39;s 
physician. You&#39;ve all had a trying day, Now I suggest you all go rest 
until you come back to your senses!&quot;

&quot;I dunno, perhaps she&#39;s right...&quot; Nicole said quietly, looking fearfully 
at Quistis.

Fujin looked ready to explode and Raijin put a firm hand on her 
shoulder.

&quot;You gotta calm down ya know.&quot;

&quot;RELEASE.&quot; Fujin huffed, then turned snarling at everyone in the room. 
&quot;OUT!&quot; She snapped, chasing them out of the room. &quot;OUT, ALL OF YOU!&quot;

&quot;Fujin?&quot; Ellone frowned.

&quot;NOT NOW.&quot; Fujin sighed wearily, then shut the door.

Outside of Quistis&#39; room, everyone looked at Kadowaki expectantly. She 
crumpled slightly under their gaze.

&quot;Look.&quot; She sighed. &quot;It&#39;s for the best, at lest wait a little while. Let 
Quistis rest, it&#39;s been a strain on her system. I want you and Fujin to 
sit down and explain what you two are doing, then, after a few days I 
may let you continue in a supervised manner.&quot;

&quot;She may not have a few days...&quot; Ellone frowned.

&quot;Nonsense, her deterioration, while troubling is stable for now.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s right doc.&quot; Zell piped up. &quot;If those guardians are running amok 
in her head then all it would take is for one of them to settle down 
somewhere really important. What if she like, forgets how to breathe or 
something...?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s on life support.&quot; Kadowaki noted.

&quot;That&#146;s not the point.&quot; He sighed.

&quot;Doc K.&quot; Raijin said stoically. &quot;These guys are SEED, they know their 
stuff ya know.&quot;

Kadowaki sighed and nodded gravely.

&quot;Let me sleep on it and consult Cid. I&#39;ll decide tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Ellone smiled, bowing courteously.

&quot;Don&#39;t thank me yet. Now come on, I&#39;ve got to lock up for the night.&quot; 
Kadowaki said cautiously shepherding them out of the clinic.

**********

By the time Raijin arrived back at the apartment. Jaya and Miguel, had 
already returned from Nida and Xu&#39;s. Jaya rushed forward with open arms 
and hugged him tightly.

&quot;Hey guys.&quot; He smiled. &quot;Kissing her fondly on the cheek then nodding to 
Miguel who sat quietly reading on the couch.

&quot;Sorry I was gone all day, was checking on my sis ya know.&quot;

&quot;It is okay, we have been watching much television.&quot; Jaya grinned.

&quot;I&#39;ll never understand the draw...&quot; Miguel mumbled.

&quot;He&#39;s right Jaya, that stuff will rot yer brain ya know.&quot;

&quot;Xu says she has many such films if I wish to borrow. May I?&quot; Jaya asked 
eagerly. Raijin laughed.

&quot;I&#39;m not you&#39;re dad, you don&#39;t need my permission.&quot;

&quot;Wonderful!&quot; Jaya beamed. Miguel rolled his eyes at her.

&quot;Problem though. Where are you planning to watch em?&quot; Raijin grinned.

&quot;Oh my...&quot;

&quot;I did not consider that.&quot;

&quot;Yup, no TV here and even if there was we wouldn&#39;t be here long enough 
for you to watch them. You forget, that expedition heads up North in 
couple of days.&quot;

&quot;He is right sister.&quot; Miguel said quietly.

&quot;Oh yes the expedition...most unfortunate. I will tell Xu thank you, but 
no.&quot;

&quot;Trust me, you&#39;re not missing much.&quot;

&quot;Besides, Father would have a fit if he knew what I was letting you get 
away with.&quot;

&quot;He is held by old ways, there is no need to live like nomads anymore.&quot; 
Jaya sighed.

&quot;It is our life, and it&#39;s a good one. We do not go and get into wars and 
we don&#39;t own land so we don&#39;t help fatten up corrupt governments.&quot;

&quot;Hey now.&quot; Raijin said firmly, trying to keep the conversation out of 
potentially murky waters.

&quot;How is you&#39;re sister?&quot; Jaya asked, changing the subject.

&quot;Not good, she and the Doctor got into a argument. Fu got flustered and 
kicked everyone out.&quot;

&quot;Sad.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, she hates trying to argue. She has trouble getting her points 
across because of her speech impediment and trying to just pisses her 
off.&quot;

&quot;From what you told me, I would imagine so.&quot; Miguel noted.

&quot;So happens now?&quot; Jaya asked.

&quot;Who knows.&quot; Raijin said, stretching his arms wide into a yawn. &quot;Doc K 
says she&#39;ll think of something in the morning, so I guess we wait ya 
know.&quot;

Miguel arched a brow.

&quot;Your sister seems more stubborn than you. Do you truly think she&#39;ll do 
what this Doctor says?&quot;

Raijin paused and frowned.

&quot;Somehow I doubt it.&quot; He admitted grimly.

*****************

Ellone slept quietly, something she feared she&#39;d be unable to do after 
the frightening encounter in Quistis&#39; mind. Something caused the hairs 
on the back of her neck to bristle and she stirred slightly. As she 
opened her eyes a hand clamped over her mouth and she screamed in 
muffled silence.

&quot;CALM!&quot; Fujin hissed, wincing.

Ellone stared in a mix of relief and anger at her as Fujin removed her 
hand.

&quot;What the hell are you doing here!&quot;

&quot;SILENCE...&quot; Fujin winced again, putting a finger to her lips.

&quot;How&#39;d!?&quot;

&quot;PICKED LOCK.&quot;

&quot;Why!?&quot;

&quot;KNOCKING DRAW ATTENTION.&quot;

&quot;Oh no!&quot; Ellone gasped, shaking her head.

&quot;MUST ACT.&quot;

&quot;Kadowaki said...&quot;

&quot;PLEASE.&quot; Fujin said as softly as she could manage.

&quot;It could be dangerous, you heard what the Doctor said.&quot;

&quot;I KNOW...&quot;

&quot;You realize what could happen don&#39;t you...?&quot;

&quot;YES.&quot;

&quot;You, me, Quistis, we could all be killed next time...&quot;

&quot;I ALONE THEN.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Ellone blinked.

&quot;SEND ME.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if I can, besides, there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to be 
responsible if something were to happen.&quot;

Fujin nodded in understanding and handed her an envelope.

&quot;What is this?&quot; Ellone frowned skeptically.

&quot;LETTER.&quot;

&quot;I figured that, what&#39;s it say?&quot;

&quot;SAYING I FORCED YOU.&quot;

&quot;Forced me, you aren&#39;t forcing me...&quot; Ellone frowned then grew solemn as 
she studied Fujin&#39;s gray features. &quot;Are you...?&quot;

Fujin stiffened at the suggestion then looked down in disappointment. 
That Ellone could think her possible of such a thing hurt her deeply and 
it showed. Shaking her head, she closed her eye and sighed sadly as she 
turned to leave.

&quot;Fujin!&quot; Ellone called, clamoring out of bed. Snagging her feet in the 
tangle of sheets she fell face first onto the carpet. &quot;Hold on, I&#39;m 
sorry, wait a minute!&quot; She babbled, trying to untangle herself. &quot;That 
was wrong of me to think that... I&#39;ll help you...&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE...&quot; Fujin said sullenly.

&quot;No, no, it&#39;s okay, really.&quot; Ellone said eagerly, rushing to her side. 
Taking her hand in hers she held it tightly. &quot;Look, I just want you to 
be sure first. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m afraid or anything...well, okay just a 
little. But Quistis saved my life, it&#39;d be wrong for me not to help 
her...&quot;

Fujin looked at her sternly, studying her features intently. Finally, 
with a grave look, she nodded.

&quot;COME...&quot;

*******************************

&quot;I&#39;ve never been out here before...&quot; Celest breathed as the wind whipped 
around them. Seifer grinned and looked out at the blue lights shining 
brightly below them. They two of them stood on a small outcropping at 
the very bottom of Balamb Garden. Their perch put them in line with the 
magically charged rings that supported Balamb&#39;s Flight. The sheer power 
of the place caused Celest&#39;s hair to stand on end and crackle with 
energy. She giggled cautiously while trying to wrangle it down.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s different from how I remember.&quot; He laughed, patting at his 
own bristling hair. &quot;This is where I used to come to get away from it 
all. Of course, back then it used to overlook huge cavern.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure we&#39;re safe out here. I mean, sheesh?&quot; Celest asked, as an 
harmless arc of electricity danced between her fingertips.&quot;

&quot;I think so.&quot; Seifer laughed.

&quot;Think so!?&quot; She gawked.

&quot;We&#39;ll so long as they don&#39;t land in the ocean or something.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s not funny.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t supposed to be.&quot; He shrugged as a gust of wind brought up a 
cloud of mist from the sea, just several yards below them.

Celest rolled her eyes. &quot;It is beautiful though, how did you know about 
it?&quot;

&quot;Oh man.&quot; He laughed. &quot;Me and Fu, we&#39;ve been in all these tunnels.&quot;

&quot;I thought no one knew about them.&quot;

&quot;Oh, they didn&#39;t.&quot; He laughed again. &quot;We figured we&#39;d get in trouble if 
anyone found out, so we stayed quiet. This was our secret place.&quot;

&quot;I see, so you two?&quot; She asked quietly.

Seifer frowned slightly as if he tasted something bad.

&quot;No...&quot; He sighed. &quot;I was stupid, I didn&#39;t see her that way.&quot;

&quot;Why not, from what I&#39;ve heard she adored you.&quot;

&quot;I know...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to bring that up.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s cool. I&#39;m over it now and it&#39;s all in the past.&quot; He said quietly, 
leaning over the railing to watch the ocean roll by beneath them. A 
silence ensued as both sat in quiet thought. Celest moved closer to his 
side and watched him curiously.

&quot;You&#39;ve endured so much...&quot; She said sadly.

&quot;Not as much as I&#39;ve caused though.&quot;

&quot;True...but like you said, it&#39;s all in the past.&quot;

&quot;Somewhat, but it&#39;ll always be there, just when I think things can be 
normal again.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a burden, but one even you admitted to having brought on 
yourself.&quot;

&quot;I know all this, I carry it with me everyday.&quot;

&quot;But you don&#39;t have to carry it alone.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s corny.&quot; He laughed, glancing at her. Celest blushed and smiled.

&quot;But it&#39;s true. I mean, you looked past all my faults and gave me a 
second chance. I figure I can do the same.&quot; She shrugged.

&quot;Faults...&quot; He snorted sarcastically. &quot;You&#39;re just confused, I wouldn&#39;t 
go so far as to call em faults.

&quot;Thanks...? I think?&quot; She mumbled thoughtfully.

&quot;Look.&quot; He sighed, raising up to face her. &quot;You&#39;re a lovely girl.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say that...&quot; She frowned.

&quot;What...?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say that, it sounds like you&#39;re about to ditch me. I&#39;m tired of 
everyone running from me...&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;s running!? I never said that.&quot;

&quot;Still...&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot; He smiled, trying to keep her spirits up. &quot;Calm down, I&#39;m not 
going anywhere.&quot; He said firmly. &quot;But I want you to be sure you 
understand what could happen if we go down this road.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care anymore...&quot; She mumbled, looking at her feet sullenly.

Seifer groaned, everything about this seemed against his better 
judgment..

&quot;Someone must have done a number on you if you&#39;re willing to be seen 
with a bastard like me.&quot;

&quot;Stop that.&quot; She mumbled, resting her head tentatively on his chest. He 
looked down at her at a loss, then awkwardly put an arm around her.

&quot;Okay...&quot; He said whispered, as she clung tightly to him.

****************

Bleak, tortured, and hopeless, a landscape of eternal nothingness, Fujin 
shivered, as she always did at the sight of it.

&quot;I hope you&#39;re up for this...&quot; Ellone asked; her voice carried on the 
wind. Fujin felt uneasy, they had decided to try and keep Ellone&#39;s 
presence to a minimum for several reasons, one, was to keep the strain 
down and two, to try and shield her from future assaults from the insane 
guardians forces.

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Fujin whispered, glancing around.

A howl issued forth in the distance and dark storm clouds melted across 
the sky over head.

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Ellone asked, sensing the change.

&quot;Storm is brewing.&quot; Fujin frowned as warm rain started to fall. 
&quot;Raining...&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s strange...&quot;

&quot;Indeed.&quot; Fujin agreed and started her trek, trying to navigate the 
emptiness with the power of will alone. Focusing her thoughts, she 
brought to mind private memories, some horrible others personal and 
delicate in hopes to draw the Guardians to her like a beacon.

It seemed like an eternity before things changed. As she walked, the 
ground began to shift from that of barren cracked earth to sparse rocky 
outcroppings that lay amid ankle deep water. Finally she came across 
what looked to be Quistis&#39; classroom, devoid of walls and sitting out in 
the open. Fujin frowned at the site of it but her heart rejoiced. It was 
surely a sign that something remained.

As she grew closer, the sound of typing caught her attention and she 
noticed a figure typing away at one of the desks.

&quot;Luccian...&quot; She snarled.

The handsome, dark hared youth glanced up at her with a grin that was 
just a bit wider than natural, displaying a smile full of small dull 
teeth. His eyes, like the apparition of Aeka were black and shimmered 
with a field of stars in their depths.

&quot;She&#39;s just using you to make her feel better about herself.&quot; He said 
absently, not really looking at her. &quot;She doesn&#39;t love you.&quot;

&quot;Why are you here?!&quot; Fujin scowled, shoving aside the heavy desks to get 
to him.

&quot;Fu? What&#39;s going on!?&quot; Ellone asked worriedly as Fujin grabbed him by 
the collar and all but jerked him up off the ground.

&quot;You&#39;re a screw up, just end it all, give up, then you can finally 
rest.&quot; Luccian sighed sadly. &quot;Aren&#39;t you tired of it all? Quit trying, 
there&#39;s no point to it, you&#39;re only fail in the end, like you failed 
me.&quot;

Fujin slapped him viciously but to no affect. In fact, he didn&#39;t even 
seem to register her presence.

&quot;Fujin, stop, he&#39;s not real.&quot; Ellone pleaded. &quot;He doesn&#39;t even know 
you&#39;re there.&quot;

She was right; he didn&#39;t even seem to acknowledge her presence as he 
continued his dark, destructive murmuring.

&quot;What...?&quot; Fujin asked, stepping back nervously from him.

&quot;I understand what&#39;s going on.&quot; Ellone elaborated. &quot;That Aeka girl, and 
this guy, their part of Quistis&#39; memory and thoughts, fragments, adrift 
in her mind. I&#39;m thinking this freak represents some kind of sense of 
failure or self-loathing given form. Does that make any sense?&quot;

&quot;Lots.&quot; Fujin growled, turning her back to the thing as it continued 
whispering self-destructive urges.

&quot;Aeka then?&quot; Fujin asked, quickening her pace, that apparition of 
Luccian, obviously wasn&#39;t a good sign, perhaps Quistis, wherever she 
was, was ready to give up.

&quot;That, I don&#39;t know. Perhaps, some aspect of her teaching, she did steer 
us in the right direction concerning the guardians.&quot; Ellone surmised. 
&quot;Any luck finding any of the errant guardians?&quot;

&quot;Think so... there is water everywhere; it could mean Leviathan is 
near.&quot;

&quot;Is that good or bad?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll know when I find him.&quot;

The ground grew to mush and the water was soon knee deep and Fujin was 
forced to adopt long sloshing gait that would be funny in any other 
circumstance. Here and there were broken bits of scenery, laying 
scattered haphazardly and half buried in the muddy waters. Part of 
Balamb&#39;s halls here, a piece of Quistis&#39; bedroom there. Everything 
looked cramped and crumpled, as if a great blanket had tried to cover it 
all.

The ground shook slightly and Fujin stopped cold. Something was moving 
under the ground. She had Pandemonia on call if needed, as well as Siren 
who had grown to enjoy Fujin&#39;s presence. However it was unknown what 
kind of effect summoning them in such a place would have and she was 
loath to risk it.

&quot;Fujin?&quot; Ellone asked, noting the silence.

Fujin was about to answer when the ground split wide in a great slurping 
noise. Out of the rush of draining water and mud a great serpent rose 
forth, skeletal and decayed, with bits of bloated, waterlogged flesh 
hanging from its bones.

&quot;Found him!&quot; Fujin blurted. She could only stare in shock at the sight 
of the once noble creature brought low by madness and nightmare. The 
pause was only momentary, and she quickly clamored onto an outcropping 
made of old bricks and wood beams. It looked like the wall of an old 
castle lying on its side.

The creature hissed and sniffed the air, as its milky, shrunken eyes 
looked around blindly. Fujin was about to thank her fortune until it 
locked its sightless gaze on her and started to coil.

&quot;Damn it.&quot; She hissed, instinctively reached for her chakram, which was 
a bit odd considering it had been destroyed and that none of this was 
real. Imagine her surprise then when she found the weapon strapped 
snuggly to her back.

She had barely drawn the weapon when the earth around her exploded into 
violent burst of brackish water; the flood immediately washed her off 
her feet and sent her crashing amid the bizarre ruins that dotted the 
ethereal landscape.

&quot;Fujin! Are you okay!?&quot; Ellone called to her frantically. Unable to 
answer lest she risk drowning Fujin remained silent as she struggled to 
keep from having her brains dashed against errant rocks.

Finally the flood subsided and she found herself flat on her back in 
shallow in the receding waters. Coughing harshly she struggled to her 
feet and ignored the bursts of pain that rang out from various parts of 
her body.

&quot;I&#39;m okay.&quot; Fujin called, looking around for Leviathan. She found him 
easy enough. The great serpent slid though the shallow waters at an 
amazing speed, sending up a mix of stone and water in its wake.

The insane guardian was closing fast, its fanged mouth was agape and it 
seemed more than eager to swallow her whole. Fujin found herself 
wondering what would happen if she died inside Quistis mind. Would she 
simply wake up as if from a nightmare, or would she die for real. 
Somehow she knew it would be the latter and her eyes widened as 
Leviathan bore down on her. Out of options, she did the only thing she 
could and jumped.

Leviathan roared in annoyance as she leapfrogged over its head. She fell 
rear first onto the creature&#39;s back and it slid under her causing her to 
bounce comically along its length. That is, until she slammed the bladed 
edge of her chakram into its back. Leviathan roared and flexed wildly 
trying to buck her off but to no avail, the bladed weapon was lodged 
deeply between what remained of the its once lustrous scales. Fujin held 
on for dear life as the creature shot forward, crashing headlong through 
debris and sending them arcing towards her. She ducked and dodged the 
best she could and prayed for a chance to finish the damned thing before 
it killed her.

&quot;Fujin! This is getting out of hand!&quot; Ellone screamed.

&quot;Negative!&quot; Fujin shouted as Leviathan headed towards what appeared to 
be deeper water. She realized grimly as did Ellone that it was meaning 
to drown her.

&quot;I&#39;m pulling us out!&quot; Ellone shouted in fright.

&quot;NEGATIVE!&quot; Fujin screamed, and slammed one of her hands into the wound 
her chakram caused. Gritting her teeth, she summoned up her most potent 
fire spell and cast it deep into the wound. The explosion was massive 
and the area under Fujin swelled grotesquely then ruptured messily. The 
blast was tremendous, blowing the bewildered Guardian in half and 
sending Fujin flying into the muck like a meteor.

&quot;Fujin!&quot; Ellone screamed in shock, appearing out of thin air to rush to 
her aid. Fujin sat up wild eyed, then screamed in pain. The arm she used 
to cast the spell was a ruin of burnt and tattered flesh.

&quot;Hyne!&quot; Ellone gurgled, nearly vomiting at the carnage around her. Both 
she and Fujin shimmered as her concentration slipped. With a snarl Fujin 
lunged to her feet and grabbed her with her good arm.

&quot;Focus!&quot; She screamed, shaking her violently.

&quot;I...I...!&quot; Ellone babbled as Leviathan thrashed behind them in its 
agonized death throes.

&quot;Focus!&quot; Fujin shouted again. &quot;Not real remember! If we leave now, this 
is all for nothing!&quot;

Ellone gulped and looked ready to hyperventilate. Fujin got in her face 
and locked her gaze with hers.

&quot;Easy...&quot; She whispered.

&quot;Easy...&quot; Ellone said weakly.

&quot;Focus.&quot;

&quot;Focus...&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; Fujin smiled shakily. &quot;Now get out of here, let me finish this.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re hurt...&quot; Ellone whimpered.

&quot;I&#39;ll be okay, now go.&quot; Fujin assured her, wincing through the pain.

&quot;Are you sure...?&quot;

&quot;Yes, now, go.&quot; Fujin said, waving her away as she staggered towards 
Leviathan which was lying on its back panting weakly. Ellone did as she 
was told and faded from view as Fujin knelt by the dying creature.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Fujin said gently as the dying guardian gasped for air. 
&quot;I&#39;ll make it better though.&quot; She vowed, placing a hand against its jaw. 
Closing her eyes, she focused on the very spirit of the guardian and 
guided it carefully into her own mind. Slowly, the tortured remains of 
Leviathan faded from view, as did the watery ruins that surrounded them, 
leaving behind only the usual bleak landscape.

With that task complete, Fujin focused on her wounds, drawing forth a 
battery of healing magics she went about the task of regenerating her 
arm. The limb reformed, but was gaunt and paler than normal. Worst of 
all it was weak and all but useless. However, Fujin counted her 
blessings, it was better than nothing. The real worry though was what 
effect the wound would have in the real world.

&quot;Well?&quot; Ellone asked, her voice trailing in the wind.

&quot;I&#39;m okay, I have Leviathan.&quot; Fujin answered.

&quot;Wonderful! Is everything okay?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s glad to be free, I think it&#39;ll be okay.&quot;

&quot;Good, now what?&quot;

&quot;Shiva.&quot; Fujin groaned as a chill blew through the area.

&quot;Is that it?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s enough.&quot;</pre>
