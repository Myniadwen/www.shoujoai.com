<div>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i>&quot;Hey Fu, wakey wakey in dere! 
Fu, you in ‘dere? Fu?! Ah, come on - it’s time, open up!! Fu! FUU!!&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rattled by his incessant bellowing, 
she glanced over at where the door was bulging in its frame. If the 
fool kept up with such meaty blows, he’d knock down if he wasn’t 
careful – which frankly he never was. She couldn’t open up yet though. 
She needed… just a few more minutes. Yes, a few more minutes would 
do it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i>&quot;You up, Fu? Fu! Are you even 
in dere? FU!! We’re gonna be late, Fu!!&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She did her best to shut it all out, 
but the thumping was so insistent; you couldn’t turn it off. Exasperated, 
she looked over to the door, intending to issue a stern rebuke. But 
the words died in her throat… With each new pound, the door was squirming 
and distending. It was like in some sort of cartoon strip, bulging, 
pulsing and beating obscenely…</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A sudden wave of nausea washed over 
her; she staggered dizzily against the wardrobe, vaguely registering 
the tinkling of falling objects within. Take control… Swallowing hard 
to regain her composure, she pushed up from where she was leaning, wincing 
uncomfortably at the continued pounding from the door. ‘Just… go 
away!’ she thought angrily. ‘Go away or…’ She needed to calm 
down, busy herself with something. Take control… calm down and take 
control… you can do it… you can do it…</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Opened the wardrobe, she peered in 
to inspect what if any damage had been done. However, her attention 
was immediately arrested by the mirror hanging on the inside of the 
door. There she was, staring blankly back… A fresh thrill of dread 
shot through her; her silvery hair felt like it was standing on end.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Before all that happened, she’d always 
taken… not <i>pride</i> in her appearance, but certainly care. She’d 
had the routine down to a fine art - everything in its place, as perfect 
as she could make it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i>&quot;Aw, you cannot still be sleeping, 
ya know? Fu!! Don’t make me start the day like this. I don’t wanna 
break the door down!&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It had always been so important to 
her… Rigid and stern demeanour; clothes authoritarian and slightly 
threatening - a look that dared people to say something, try something… 
She’d woken up every day, eager to meet that girl; to stand in awe 
of her like everyone else. That girl had had her life together; she’d 
known exactly who she was. And the girl had always looked out for her, 
kept her safe from everyone.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Where are you?&quot; she pleaded 
softly, tracing a finger sadly across the glass image. The mirror girl 
didn’t respond, just stared deadly through her with its good eye. 
The other eye, milky and lifeless in the socket, seemed to bore into 
her, infecting her. In its horrid pale depths, she saw the monstrosity 
she felt inside of her laid bare. It was disgusting, it was inescapable… 
it was who she was.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i>CRACK!!</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jolted back to her senses, Fujin wrenched 
open the other cupboard door and hurriedly retrieved her eye patch from 
a shelf. Turning her back on the newcomer, she quickly slipped it over 
her head, and rearranged it with a cursory glance in the mirror. The 
girl still wasn’t home, so she’d have to put on the show by herself 
again.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;IDIOT.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She looked towards the door, which 
now lay splintered on the floor, in a fine layer of dust. With a look 
of pity and contempt, she walked over to inspect the damage. Irritated, 
she snapped a sharp look at him. He shrugged helplessly:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Well, ya weren’t answering, 
ya know? We were gonna be late and…and…&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">‘Here it comes,’ she thought: ‘A 
truly stupid idea, which will somehow translate into a plausible suggestion 
in his thick head.’</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Even now she had to marvel at his unique 
logic. He’d just smashed her door off its hinges, yet he was waiting 
outside because he hadn’t been invited in… She folded her arms, 
pretending to be waiting with bated breath. Truth be told however, her 
heart was pounding in her ears, and she felt more than a little faint. 
She dug her fingers into her elbows, trying to just get through this 
conversation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mercifully, she didn’t have to wait 
long before the familiar gleam appeared in his eyes. The gleam that 
told that a suitably improbable excuse had now been formulated...</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And… I was worried something 
might&#39;ve happened to ya. Not responding, ya know – got worried, see? 
So… so I… ya know…?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">He gestured at the door with what she 
was sure was genuine pride, so convinced he undoubtedly now was, at 
the truthfulness of his ridiculous, spur of moment story.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;IN SCHOOL?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">He looked puzzled briefly, but in his 
usual manner of not wanting to seem like he hadn’t understood, adopted 
a look like he was really considering what she had said carefully, and 
with respect.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She sighed heavily. She was disgusted 
with his oafishness of course, but at the same time, it was familiar 
and comforting. It made her feel less nervous, safer. But just as she 
was allowing this soothing thought to massage her nerves, she noticed 
that several gawpers had also gathered to watch the scene. She could 
feel the fear returning.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;LEAVE!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Oh right, well I’m sorry Fu, 
but…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Seeing the onlookers off with the fiercest 
glare she could manage, his words finally sunk in as she saw his retreating 
figure following them, shoulders slumped and head hanging. She would 
probably find it hard to believe that anyone could be as simple as him, 
were it not for his daily reminders.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;NOT YOU!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Raijin turned back, a broad smile on 
his face. He stomped into the room, hugged her in one huge arm (which 
she pointedly did not return), and threw himself down into a chair near 
the door. Producing a screwdriver from somewhere, he hummed happily 
to himself, as he searched through the debris for one of the hinges.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Swallowing hard, she fought her panic 
down frantically. She had to get him out of here now! But she couldn’t 
let on that she was freaking out like this… she’d always worked 
so hard to be strong around the guys. And come on – it was only Raijin 
after all! He was her best friend… her only friend really…</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But she wasn’t ready! By now, she 
was of course used to his acts of random, well-meaning but still irksome 
physicality, but she was usually better prepared… She wasn’t ready 
for people today yet, not even if it was only someone essentially harmless 
like Raijin. She turned back to her wardrobe quickly, trying to look 
busy.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Glad that’s all cleared up 
then…” Raijin commented cheerfully. “Good of you to see it like 
this, Fu. I mean, I was only trying to help after all, so you inviting 
me in…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;DIDN’T,&quot; she reminded 
him, searching with quiet desperation for aid in the mirror, but to 
no avail.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Oh… well… I thought because 
you’d forgiven me, you…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;DIDN’T!!&quot; she shouted 
with exasperation, turning about to face him, her belt suddenly in her 
hand, knuckles whitening in fury.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Blinking hard, she pulled on the belt’s 
ends, working out the stress. Conscious of the need to calm down and 
disarm herself, she swiftly threaded the belt around her waist. Breathing 
a soft sigh of relief, she looked up.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Raijin however, hadn’t noticed a 
thing, it seemed. A blank look on his face, he seemed deeply confused, 
looking at the door, making slight hugging gestures, apparently trying 
to work out where he had misunderstood matters. The experience had all 
gotten a bit much for him, it seemed…</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fujin smiled with relief, pleased for 
once with his ignorance. She still needed to get rid of him though - 
quickly. Forcing down her anxieties, she walked up to him, trying to 
adopt a friendly posture – such didn’t come naturally to her. After 
a twitchy start, she managed a small smile.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;LATE. GO ON.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Instantly pacified, he returned the 
grin and leapt to his feet. She shot him a sharp look causing him to 
think better of an attempt to hug her again, instead bounding out the 
door, apparently without a care in the world. If only it was that easy 
for her, she mused miserably.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dropping her guard momentarily, she 
threw her arms back up to cross in front of her as he suddenly leaned 
back in round the door frame. He opened his mouth to say something, 
but in an uncharacteristically smart move, decided better of it – 
perhaps sensing the tangible rage emanating from her body. He settled 
for placing the broken hinge of her door gently down on a nearby chair 
and with a look of apology, retreated once more.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Checking he really was gone this time, 
she breathed a huge sigh of relief. Walking back over to the wardrobe, 
she steadied herself it, feeling her heart-rate slowly return to normal. 
Reaching up, she pulled her hands down over her face, trying to push 
the last of her anxiety out. She’d passed the day’s first test… 
just.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Even though it had only been Raijin, 
it had still been hard. And those people in the corridor before… she 
could just imagine what they thought; what they were saying to each 
other right now about the psycho new teacher…</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Angrily she tried to shake her head 
clear, tightening her belt further, until she could feel it constricting 
just a little too tightly. It was to be expected – somehow she had 
to find the strength to deal with it. It was time to go after all - 
time to once again face the world she had almost helped to destroy.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Absently, she reached out a hand and 
touched the mirror, without looking at it: &quot;I need you back - I 
don’t know if I can do this by myself…&quot; she pleaded softly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But that was just wishful thinking 
– no-one could help her or would even want to. Not her reflection, 
notRaijin, not even… well, why should <i>she</i> care? Fujin certainly 
didn’t blame her – she had no right whatsoever to expect her to 
care now. it was pointless even thinking about it…</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">With that, she set her face, straightened 
up and marched smartly out of the room, clicking her fingers at a passing 
girl and indicating the broken door.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;FIX.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The girl nodded, and bent down to get 
a look. Fujin stepped away quickly in case she brushed against her. 
She was struck with an overwhelming urge to add the word ‘please’. 
No, that wasn’t something the old Fujin would have said - people would 
talk. They’d know she was weak; they’d laugh at her and point, they’d 
eat her alive.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;HURRY!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">And without waiting for a reaction, 
she snapped about and hurried away, heart pounding in her chest.</font></p>
