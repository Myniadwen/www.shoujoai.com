&quot;How the hell did you get here!&quot; Zell said in shock. Seifer smiled a 
half-cocked smile and looked at him with mirthful eyes.

&quot;She waits, bids her time for the ending, of the beginning.&quot; He shouted 
gloriously.

&quot;Careful Zell, he&#39;s gone mad.&quot; Squall said dangerously. &quot;Go away Seifer, 
we have no quarrel with you anymore.&quot;

&quot;Quarrel, no, past deeds, yes and more to come, her fault as all was and 
will be.&quot; Seifer said simply and ran a hand through his tangled mass of 
hair.

&quot;Hyne, what&#39;s happened to you.&quot; Zell said quietly, his voice was 
compassionate and full of pity. He didn&#39;t care much for Seifer but he 
didn&#39;t like seeing the once, vibrate man reduced to a filthy, babbling 
lunatic.

Seifer noted the look of sorrow on Zell&#39;s face and spat towards him in 
disgust.

&quot;Keep your kind eyes. Know nothing of what I do, service to all, knight 
to the world.&quot; He proclaimed proudly.

&quot;Squall man what happened to him, he was fine last time we seen him? I 
mean yeah he was a nut then but he was nothing like this.&quot;

&quot;Who knows.&quot; Squall threw his hands into the air; this is the last thing 
he wanted to deal with.

&quot;Not thinking to find a knight, or the lady either? Time is odd for us 
both then, as she wills it.&quot; Seifer eyed Squall suspiciously.

&quot;What lady, Seifer what the hell are you doing in a place like this?&quot; 
Zell tried again, hoping to get some kind of answer from him.

Seifer rubbed his face in frustration.

&quot;Answers, answers, this and all and nothing, you come here and not know 
why! Idiots, careless, why trouble this place. You are not the ones 
then.&quot;

&quot;Zell, ignore him, he&#39;s raving.&quot; Squall sighed.

&quot;Think so do you.&quot; Seifer said with a smile.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you?&quot; Squall snapped back.

&quot;Come with me.&quot; Seifer motioned with his hand and headed off into the 
back of the cave.

&quot;Finally we can get some answers.&quot; Zell nodded eagerly.

&quot;Zell, what are you doing?&quot; Squall said sitting back down by the fire.

&quot;He hey may be able to help us.&quot; Zell offered.

&quot;Think about it, he&#39;s out of his mind, you&#39;ll be lucky if he doesn&#39;t try 
to kill you if you follow him.&quot;

&quot;I am thinking about it.&quot; Zell smirked. &quot;If he got here, then that means 
has transportation.&quot;

Squall soured, he hated to admit it but Zell had a point.

&quot;Damn it alright.&quot; He said, getting up and grabbing his gunblade.

&quot;Move onward you fools!&quot; Seifer shouted back to them, having vanished 
into the darkness.

*****************

&quot;Pregnant.&quot; Irvine said quietly, he blinked a moment then fell over on 
his rear. &quot;As in baby...&quot; He mumbled. Selphie closed her eyes and 
trembled.

She had suspected he wouldn&#39;t willingly accept the responsibility. He 
was still so immature, they both were. She could adapt, she knew she 
could, she loved children. Irvine though, she opened her eyes to look at 
him. His expression spoke volumes, his eyes were wide and his mouth 
agape. Words died in his throat as he tried to speak.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She whispered as the tears formed.

Irvine stood up and staggered to the kitchen. He fumbled with a glass 
and poured some water. He quickly downed it and looked at Selphie, he 
expression trembling.

&quot;Well.&quot; She said quietly waiting for his condemnation.

******************

&quot;She&#39;s not home.&quot; Celest said with shrug.

&quot;Apparently. She&#39;s probably off with Fujin somewhere.&quot; Nicole added.

&quot;Don&#39;t remind me.&quot; Rinoa sighed. &quot;Let&#39;s go talk to Selphie then.&quot;

&quot;At least the stupid heaters are off.&quot; Nicole said as they made their 
way up the hall.

&quot;I like the heat, you get to strip down and all the guys run around 
without their shirts, yum!&quot;

&quot;You as bad as brother.&quot; Rinoa sighed.

&quot;I just say what everyone is thinking, at least I&#39;m honest.&quot;

It didn&#39;t take them long to reach their destination. Rinoa was just 
started knocking when they heard Irvine bellow.

&quot;YEHAW!&quot;

&quot;What the hell?&quot; Celest looked at the others blankly?

&quot;I dunno.&quot; Nicole shrugged.

The front door burst open and arm reached out and grabbed Rinoa by the 
shoulders, pulling her bodily into the apartment. She screamed in fright 
as she found herself being spun in the air.

&quot;NOA!&quot; Irvine screamed while laughing loudly.

&quot;What the hell?&quot; Celest repeated as she peeked into the apartment. 
Nicole looked over shoulder warily.

&quot;Um are we interrupting something.&quot; She asked politely.

Selphie stood by the kitchen in wide-eyed shock, a soft smile dancing at 
the edges of her mouth.

With a rambunctious fervor he let Rinoa go, she spun haphazardly in 
circles before plopping heavily onto the couch. He immediately grabbed 
Celest who slapped at him madly in an attempt to get away.

&quot;Lemmi go you lummox!&quot; She hollered as he danced about the room with her 
in tow.

Nicole took the opportunity to attempt to sneak past but was promptly 
grabbed and pulled into a group hug. She found herself buried face first 
in Celest&#39;s chest.

&quot;GAH!&quot; She yelped as Irvine hugged the two of them tightly.

&quot;Let, go, you clown!&quot; Celest barked and tried to wiggle free.

&quot;Irvine.&quot; Selphie giggled.

&quot;YES!?&quot; Irvine said excitedly he then dropped both girls and ran over to 
kneel before Selphie. &quot;What&#39;s wrong!?&quot; He said worriedly and took her 
hand in his.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong is right.&quot; Rinoa said as she stood shakily.

Selphie placed a loving had on his cheek and smiled.

&quot;He&#39;s um, I guess he&#39;s happy.&quot; She said with obvious surprise.

&quot;Can I tell them!&quot; He yapped and wiggled like an excited child. Selphie 
burst out laughing, more out of relief than anything else.

&quot;Yes.&quot; She smiled.

Irvine stood and spread his arms wide, a ridiculous smile on his face.

&quot;I&#39;m going to be a father!&quot; He shouted proudly.

&quot;Whoa!&quot; Rinoa blinked in shock.

&quot;Well what do ya know.&quot; Celest chuckled and crossed her arms.

Nicole nodded then promptly fainted.

******************

Zell and Squall found Seifer squatting on a large boulder in the center 
of large chamber. The chamber was open at the top and the first rays of 
the morning sun highlighted the edges of the opening. Roots and vines 
hung in the cavern, offering easy means to climb to the surface. Half 
buried in the mud and stalactites were ruins consisting of obelisks and 
eroded statues.

&quot;What is it Seifer?&quot; Zell asked growing flustered, they&#39;d been followed 
him for nearly thirty minutes.

&quot;AHA!&quot; Seifer pointed and hopped up and down on the rock. &quot;As said, the 
one and the all, she is gone, her sentinel, her part, the one of many!&quot; 
He chattered eagerly.

&quot;You&#39;re stark raving mad, man there&#39;s nothing here but old ruins.&quot;

&quot;Told you.&quot; Squall said dryly as he entered the area.

&quot;Seifer how did you get here?&quot; Zell tried.

&quot;Pointless, and useless, home is near, home is with you and you go.&quot; 
Seifer sighed and smirked.

&quot;For the love of!&quot; Zell wanted to smack him, anything in hopes to 
getting a clear answer. Seifer grabbed his arm and yanked him towards a 
pedestal.

&quot;Observe her!&quot; He snarled and pointed.

&quot;There is nothing there!&quot; Zell snapped and pulled free.

&quot;He sees!&quot; Seifer shouted joyously.

Squall walked over to the two.

&quot;Seifer do you have a radio, anything of use?&quot; He asked firmly.

&quot;Where is she?&quot; Seifer said again with a sense of urgency.

&quot;Seifer, listen, do- you - have- a -radio.&quot; Squall said slowly.

&quot;Talking is pointless, she is what matters, stopped she was and now.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Zell asked waving his arms to get Seifer&#39;s flighty attention.

&quot;All of her.&quot; Seifer replied and pointed to the pedestal.

&quot;Fine!&quot; Squall said in a huff and knelt to examine the stone pedestal. 
&quot;What do you want us to see!?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s nothing there.&quot; Seifer answered.

Squall stood up briskly.

&quot;Squall.&quot; Zell cautioned him, reading the growing frustration in his 
eyes.

&quot;Fine there&#39;s nothing there, was is stolen?&quot; Squall tried.

&quot;Correct.&quot; Seifer cheered and gave him the thumbs up.

Squall cringed.

&quot;We&#39;ll make a deal with ya Seifer.&quot; Zell smiled and threw an arm over 
his shoulder. &quot;We help you, you help us capeesh?&quot;

&quot;Sucker born? Fault it is all, you did this.&quot; Seifer scoffed and shoved 
Zell aside.

&quot;Fault is -not- all, we did nothing but get stuck in this crazy damn 
place!&quot; Zell stormed over to Squall.

&quot;He&#39;s no help!&quot; He shouted. Squall gave him an honest yet dry smile.

&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been trying to tell you.&quot;

&quot;BEHOLD!&quot; Seifer shouted. Everyone looked at him warily. Seifer stood on 
the pedestal and point down accusingly at some metal debris on the 
ground.

&quot;What.&quot; Squall sighed and walked over to investigate. &quot;So what, It&#39;s a 
broken sword blade, Seifer can you help us or not?&quot;

&quot;The instrument of those who brought this down.&quot; Seifer proclaimed 
accusingly.

&quot;I think we should beat him until he tells us something coherent.&quot; Zell 
joked.

&quot;Try.&quot; Seifer smirked darkly.

&quot;We don&#39;t have time for this.&quot; Squall said firmly and walked over to a 
nearby root and started to climb.

&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Zell called.

&quot;Look, you can play with Seifer all day if you want to, but we need to 
get out of here.&quot; Squall shouted back down.

&quot;But, what about him?&quot; Zell said pointing to Seifer, who was busily 
picking up the pieces and sniffing them.

Squall grunted as he pulled himself up over the edge and onto the 
surface. A loud roar greeted him as a large bipedal creature looking 
like a four-armed gorilla leapt down at him. Squall beheaded the 
creature in one swift move and shouted back down at Zell.

&quot;If he want&#39;s to come he&#39;ll follow us!&quot; He said, growing ever impatient.

&quot;See ya Seifer.&quot; Zell waved sourly and followed Squall&#39;s path up to the 
surface.

*******************

Eggs, was the first thing she smelled, followed by pancakes, and 
sausage.

A smile crept to Quistis&#39;s lips as the scents aroused her hunger and 
caused her to stir. She heard a soft giggle and she opened a drowsy eye 
to investigate. Fujin was sitting cross-legged on the bed besides her 
and looking very proud of herself.

&quot;Morning.&quot; Quistis murmured cutely and yawned.

Smiling, Fujin leaned over to the nightstand and grabbed a tray.

&quot;Something smells good.&quot; Quistis sighed dreamily and sat up stretching.

Fujin, still smiling broadly offered the tray, which was heaped with 
various breakfast goodies.

&quot;Oh my.&quot; Quistis laughed and took the tray. &quot;Breakfast in bed?&quot;

Fujin nodded and grinned impishly, a look Quistis found downright 
adorable.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t have.&quot; Quistis blushed; she wasn&#39;t sure what to think. 
She sorely wondered where the food came from, as far as she knew Fujin 
was a terrible good cook and she definitely didn&#39;t want to spoil the 
mood by asking her.

&quot;Thank you hon.&quot; Quistis smiled warmly, her eyes dancing merrily. Then 
she noticed Fujin looking at her expectantly.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Quistis squeaked and without a second thought she started to eat. 
Fujin watched her with growing anticipation her expression curious, as 
she searched for a reaction. After a moment Quistis looked at her and 
giggled.

&quot;You&#39;re staring.&quot;

Fujin blinked and blushed slightly.

&quot;It&#39;s wonderful, I thought you said couldn&#39;t cook.&quot; Quistis smiled.

Fujin leaned down and picked something up off the floor. Raising up she 
held up a small cookbook.

&quot;Oh you&#39;ve been studying eh.&quot; Quistis grinned. &quot;Your just full of 
surprises aren&#39;t you.&quot;

Fujin nodded vainly and winked.

&quot;Incorrigible.&quot; Quistis chuckled and went about finishing her meal.

************

Rinoa sat out front of the classroom ready to burst. She&#39;d been wired 
ever since Selphie&#39;s announcement last night. She and the others had 
stayed up celebrating all night long. Two nights in a row of parties was 
taking its toll but she didn&#39;t care, it was a joyous occasion, and it 
served to take her mind off of Squall&#39;s absence. She looked excitedly up 
the hall, Quistis hadn&#39;t arrived yet and she counted the minutes until 
she arrived. The Treppies stood chatting amongst themselves and 
comparing notes. Aeka walked over and sat down beside her.

&quot;Hi Rinoa.&quot; She said with a bright smile. &quot;You seem extra happy today?&quot;

Rinoa went into a fit of giggles. Aeka joined her without even knowing 
why.

After a moment she paused put her hands on Rinoa&#39;s shoulders to calm 
her.

&quot;What are we laughing about.&quot; Aeka laughed.

&quot;Well.&quot; Rinoa started, then screamed in excitement upon seeing Quistis 
coming up the hall. Aeka yelled in startled response, nearly falling 
over as Rinoa jumped to her feet.

&quot;QUISTIS!&quot; Rinoa bellowed and charged her. Quistis stood like a deer 
caught in headlights, a stupid bewildered look on her face. Aeka 
followed behind as Rinoa grabbed Quistis around the waist and jumped up 
and down happily, scattering Quistis&#39;s books and papers. Aeka burst into 
cheery laughter, as several students stood dumbfounded.

&quot;Rinoa?&quot; Quistis stammered and tried to pry free.

Fujin walked by the two and gave a curious glance. She dismissed the 
antics and waited by the door.

&quot;Rinoa!&quot; Quistis finally said sternly and pulled free. &quot;What&#39;s the 
meaning of all this.&quot; She adjusted her glasses and smiled gently. &quot;I&#39;m 
glad to see you&#39;re in a good mood hon, but we have to maintain a modicum 
of professionalism when in class. Understood?&quot; She chided quietly. Rinoa 
blanched and looked back at all the students staring curiously and 
whispering amongst themselves.

&quot;Oh fudge, Quistis I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Rinoa blushed and bowed curiously.

&quot;Now what&#39;s going on?&quot; Quistis smirked, curious as to what could 
possible be so wonderful to make Rinoa come to her in such a merry 
manner. Especially considering the feuding that&#39;d been going on.

&quot;It&#39;s about...!&quot; Rinoa started then paused.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Yeah what? Aeka said curiously.

&quot;Shoo.&quot; Quistis waved her away with a grin.

&quot;Hey she was gonna tell me too!&quot; Aeka pouted.

&quot;My mistake. Now then Rinoa?&quot;

&quot;Oh I&#39;m sorry I just realized, it&#39;s not really my place to be telling.&quot; 
Rinoa said sheepishly.

&quot;AW!&quot; Aeka huffed in disappointment at being led on.

&quot;You do know I was with her right.&quot; Quistis winked as she knelt to pick 
up her papers.

&quot;With her?&quot; Rinoa blinked. &quot;Darn it!&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot; Aeka whined.

&quot;Time for class.&quot; Quistis said hurriedly and made her way through the 
students and to the door. Aeka pouted sourly and followed them.

***********************

They&#39;d been walking for hours, along the way they&#39;d been ambushed 
several times by marauding monsters of all types. Seifer who&#39;d decided 
to follow them sat by each time watching from the sidelines. Zell was 
getting fed up with all of it and let his feelings be known.

&quot;DAMN IT!&quot; He shouted angrily.

Squall stopped his trek and turned around.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sick of this, where are we going?&quot; Zell shouted.

Squall pointed to a nearby cliff.

&quot;Up there is the highest point on the island. If we are lucky we can see 
if there are any buildings or better yet if the Ragnarok is nearby.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re reaching.&quot; Zell sighed. &quot;But its better than nothing.&quot;

&quot;The great dragon that assaults Pandora fled to the sun.&quot; Seifer said 
loudly and turned back towards the caves.

&quot;What!?&quot; Zell called.

&quot;The end of the world, the great beast.&quot; Seifer said simply without 
stopping.

&quot;Where are you going now?&quot; Zell shouted.

&quot;Zell.&quot; Squall called.

&quot;Hold up.&quot; Zell waved then called back to Seifer. &quot;Seifer!&quot;

&quot;Abandon this place, useless now to me and her alike, best to move on, 
only it, that destroys lays in the path now took.&quot;

&quot;Yo Squall I think he&#39;s says something really bad lives up there.&quot;

&quot;Like we can believe him.&quot; Squall said grimly.

A roar, terrible and unlike anything ever imagined bellowed across the 
island. The ground shook rhythmically under their feet and in the trees 
ahead a great flock of birds exploded from the canopy of branches.

&quot;Great.&quot; Squall sighed.

&quot;Behold!&quot; Seifer yelled then took of running.

&quot;Crap in a hat.&quot; Zell shouted and followed his lead, having no desire to 
meet whatever would make a madman run.

A head rose above the tree line even though the trees stood well over a 
hundred feet in places. The rest of the creature must&#39;ve been 
unimaginably titanic. It&#39;s great draconic head, easily fifteen feet long 
searched over the treetops lazily. A horned bony crest extended from the 
back of it skull like a crown and cast a great shadow below it. Plumes 
of steam billowed from its nostrils and the air around it&#39;s mouth 
wavered like it was superheated.

&quot;Hyne!&quot; Squall fell back on her rear in awe of the thing.

&quot;Squall!&quot; Zell screamed. Squall scrambled to his feet and ran full tilt 
away from the beast. He soon pasted Zell and caught up with Seifer.

&quot;Told you!&quot; Seifer laughed.

************

&quot;Isn&#39;t it wonderful!&quot; Rinoa laughed as she sipped her milkshake.

Quistis chuckled and propped her head in her hands.

&quot;Yes it is, Selphie about went nuts when she found out.&quot;

&quot;ALREADY IS.&quot; Fujin mumbled and Quistis elbowed her.

&quot;A baby wow!&quot; Aeka said dreamily and dug into her sundae. Everyone had 
decided to talk about Selphie&#39;s announcement over lunch in the 
cafeteria. Rinoa and Fujin had come to the unspoken agreement not to 
talk to each other. Quistis tried her best to keep everyones mind off 
such things.

&quot;Its Nicole&#39;s birthday today, any word on Squall and Zell?&quot; She asked 
worriedly. Rinoa frowned and shook her head.

&quot;No, Cid says he talked to Luccian he said he had no idea where they 
are.&quot;

&quot;I hope they&#39;re okay.&quot; Quistis said quietly.

&quot;SQUALL TOUGH.&quot; Fujin said firmly, in an attempt to sooth their fears.

&quot;Um thanks.&quot; Rinoa grumbled but appreciated the attempt.

&quot;Those two can take on anything.&quot; Aeka smiled. &quot;I&#39;m sure they&#146;ll be 
fine, you know guys they like to make dramatic entrances and be 
fashionable late.&quot;

&quot;She has a point.&quot; Quistis smirked.

&quot;I suppose.&quot; Rinoa said taking another drink. &quot;I&#39;m not the one to 
convince though.&quot;

&quot;Nicole?&quot; Quistis guessed.

&quot;Yes she&#39;s becoming downright depressed about it.&quot;

&quot;Think we should send out search teams?&quot; Quistis said glumly.

&quot;TO WHERE?&quot; Fujin said, figuring she was better suited to be the one to 
point out gloomy facts.

&quot;She has a point.&quot; Rinoa said rubbing her head.

&quot;This is depressing lets talk about Nicole&#39;s birthday party.&quot; Aeka said 
quietly.

&quot;Yeah really.&quot; Rinoa said with a thin smile. &quot;I&#39;m trying not to worry 
over here.&quot;

&quot;What do you guys have planned. I mean, honestly, I figured I wasn&#39;t 
invited.&quot; Quistis said with dark honesty.

&quot;No one said that.&quot; Rinoa pouted. &quot;Look lets just put all that in the 
past for now, there&#39;s more important things to worry about right now.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough.&quot; Quistis smiled.

&quot;Hi guy&#39;s.&quot; Selphie said announcing her presence.

&quot;There&#39;s our mother to be.&quot; Quistis laughed.

&quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; Selphie blushed and sat down.

Aeka giggled merrily.

&quot;CONGRATULATIONS.&quot; Fujin said blandly.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Selphie smiled disarmingly. Fujin was stunned and sat quiet.

&quot;Enough about me, lets talk shop.&quot; Selphie grinned.

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis arched a brow.

&quot;The party. We have to do something for Nicole to get her spirits up, 
especially if Zell isn&#39;t back. By the way, any word on those guys?&quot; 
Selphie asked. Rinoa shook her head slowly.

&quot;They&#39;re probably hitting the bars.&quot; Selphie said mirthfully.

Rinoa laughed, knowing full well Squall would sooner spontaneously 
combust than go to a bar.

&quot;Party huh.&quot; Aeka said thoughtfully.

&quot;Yeah we&#39;re going to have small get together, nothing loud.&quot; Selphie 
said thoughtfully. &quot;I had originally planned to rent Armand Defalco for 
the party.&quot;

&quot;Oh Hyne no!&quot; Quistis blushed in horror.

&quot;Don&#39;t get you feathers in a bunch. I changed my mind. I don&#146;t think 
it&#39;d be a good idea now.&quot; Selphie said with a shrug.

&quot;Armand?&quot; Aeka asked quizzically, her curiosity having gotten the better 
of her.

&quot;STRIPPER.&quot; Fujin blurted.

Everyone looked at her curiously but none more so than Quistis. Fujin 
shifted in her seat uncomfortably.

&quot;SEIFER, GAG GIFT.&quot; Fujin offered as the only explanation having no 
desire to explain how Seifer had hired him for her. He&#39;d said; so she 
could get laid since no one would have her. She wasn&#39;t thrilled with the 
gift and chased the man off before the first article of clothing fell. 
No one said a word and went back to the conversation.

&quot;Yeah I don&#146;t think that would be a good idea Selph.&quot; Quistis said.

&quot;We could bring some movies and sleep over. I&#39;m sure she wouldn&#39;t want 
to be alone on her birthday.&quot; Selphie said thoughtfully. &quot;Just us gals.&quot;

&quot;There you are!&quot; Celest interrupted and pulled up a seat. &quot;Why are all 
of you holed up in here for? Hey, hey hiya Mom!&quot; She said ruffling 
Selphie&#39;s hair.

&quot;Leave me alone you hussy.&quot; Selphie giggled.

&quot;I like Selphie&#39;s idea.&quot; Rinoa smiled. &quot;Besides I could use the company 
too.&quot;

&quot;Uh oh, sounds like you&#39;ve all be planning something without me.&quot; Celest 
wagged an accusing finger at everyone.

&quot;We&#39;re having a sleep over at Nicole&#39;s!&quot; Akea said with a grin.

&quot;I&#39;m bringing some movies too.&quot; Quistis added.

&quot;Oh how cute, what about the stripper? I was looking forward to him.&quot; 
Celest slumped in disappointment.

&quot;Sorry no stripper.&quot; Rinoa said apologetically.

&quot;So let me get this straight we&#39;re just going to spend the night talking 
girl talk.&quot; Celest said dryly.

&quot;Yeah it&#39;ll be fun.&quot; Aeka giggled.

&quot;Perhaps, if you get off seeing girls lounging about in their undies.&quot; 
Celest rolled her eyes. &quot;I dunno, that sounds downright gay.&quot;

Quistis blinked and Fujin nearly laughed at the look on her face.

&quot;Poo.&quot; Aeka said in defiance and stuck her tongue out at Celest.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t be such a brat Celest.&quot; Rinoa laughed.

&quot;Yeah really.&quot; Selphie grumbled.

&quot;Okay, okay, I&#39;ll be there. Quisty you better have some good movies.&quot; 
Celest said sourly. Quistis just nodded quietly.

&quot;Well girls looks like we have a plan then.&quot; Selphie grinned.

********

Seifer finally stopped his mad dash through the underbrush and pointed 
to a large outcropping of rocks on the edge of a cliff overlooking the 
ocean. A pile of debris and wall of spiked logs surrounded the place.

&quot;Home it where the heart is.&quot; He said with a grin.

&quot;That&#39;s the most sense you&#39;ve made all day.&quot; Zell said and stomped off 
towards the pile. Seifer tackled him hard.

&quot;What the hell! Be careful man I have precious cargo here.&quot; Zell coughed 
and shoved Seifer off him. He started to check the eggs he carried but 
spotted what he&#39;d nearly stumbled in. A thin strand of rope lay 
stretched across his path, one end of which led up into the trees were a 
large log peppered with jagged bones and wood spikes waited for whatever 
poor creature sprung it.

&quot;Be careful.&quot; Squall said, casting a wary eye about for more booby 
traps.

&quot;GEEZE!&quot; Zell balked realizing his potentially fatal error.

&quot;Wuss.&quot; Seifer laughed and waved them to follow.

&quot;This gets better and better.&quot; Zell said with a sarcastic laugh.

&quot;Just follow him.&quot; Squall replied.

Seifer led them down a faint path along the way pointing to and leading 
them around a mind-numbing array of traps and tiger pits. They arrived 
at the wall and Seifer squeezed through a small opening after disarming 
a trap above it. Squall and Zell followed him.

&quot;Gee nice place ya got here Seifer.&quot; Zell said drolly. The rocks where 
actually a circular series of pillars that had eroded and collapsed 
inward to form an awkward but stable dome of sorts. Seifer had filled 
the gaps with debris of giant leaves and sticks, then covering it with a 
straw and mud mixture.

&quot;Option to lay with the darkness and beasts, is one&#39;s choice.&quot; Seifer 
shrugged and crawled through the small opening that served as an 
entrance.

&quot;Whatever.&quot; Zell grumbled and followed.

Squall waited a moment to look around before joining them. The interior 
of the structure was dark and cool, the stones doing a good job of 
keeping out the stifling heat. Seifer lit a fire in a pit that sat at 
the center of the dome. He then stripped out of his layers of clothing 
until he was only in a loincloth. Zell nearly laughed at the sight of 
him but Squall shot him a look so foul it stopped him before he started. 
The last thing Squall wanted was to antagonize the lunatic much less in 
his own abode. Squall noticed Seifer&#39;s gunblade sitting by the pile of 
furs that obviously served as a bed. It was well used by the looks of 
it. Zell walked about checking the place out while Seifer dug about in a 
large, crude clay pot.

&quot;Hey it&#39;s Fujin.&quot; Zell chuckled and held up a photo that hung near the 
bed.

Seifer smiled hugely and walked over to him.

&quot;Like snow, so cold, beautiful. Know now I do.&quot; He said fondly at the 
picture. Zell blanched and handed him the picture gently.

&quot;Yeah whatever guy.&quot;

&quot;Mine, to have and to hold, I know, after deeds are done.&quot; Seifer 
proclaimed.

Squall rolled his eyes and buried his head in his hands.

&quot;Spiteful was he, now though, wondrous, and great, she shall see!&quot; 
Seifer laughed and hugged Zell. Seifer&#39;s strength was nothing to scoff 
at and his time on the island made him a veritable juggernaut.

&quot;DUDE LET ME GO!&quot; Zell shouted and elbowed him atop the head.

Squall slowly stood ready to act but Seifer let him go. Still grinning 
broadly he looked down at the photo.

&quot;Joyous.&quot; He smiled.
