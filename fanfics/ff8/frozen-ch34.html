Quistis lay silent, lost in thought; she looked down fondly at woman who 
snoozed happily against her. Their night of lovemaking had been an 
unexpected wonder, Fujin surprised her with an eagerness to learn and 
explore, she&#39;d also been very insistent on returning the attention she&#39;d 
received and more. Quistis shivered exquisitely at the memory, she&#39;d 
been very attentive and far bolder than expected. Stirring, Fujin 
murmured softly in her sleep. Quistis smiled warmly and tucked the 
blankets about her. She glanced at the clock with a sigh, though she 
loathed the idea it was almost time to get up.

There was so much to do though, with finalizing Fujin&#39;s papers so that 
she could start class, along with catching up on work. She could only 
imagine what some of the students would think when Fujin joined the 
class especially with her having run around with Seifer in the 
disciplinary committee. Luccian definitely could be a problem; something 
was up between he and Fujin. She considered asking her but decided 
against it. Everyone had let it go; if Fujin cared to press the point, 
Quistis had no doubt that she would do so.

&quot;Fu.&quot; She whispered softly.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Fujin mumbled sleepily, curling against her.

&quot;I have to go hon.&quot;

Shaking her head, Fujin wrapped her arms around her in protest.

Giggling quietly Quistis ran a hand down her cheek. &quot;Sorry Love, I want 
to get everything ready so you can start classes today.&quot;

&quot;IF MUST.&quot; Fujin huffed cutely.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t pout.&quot;

&quot;I DON&#39;T.&quot;

&quot;Un huh.&quot; Quistis smiled through slit eyes then kissed her tenderly.

&quot;TEASE.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re one to talk after what you did.&quot;

&quot;DID WHAT?&quot; Fujin shrugged innocently.

&quot;You&#39;re hopeless.&quot; Quistis laughed as she regretfully slid out of bed.

Fujin shivered as the cool air hit and quickly rolled the blankets about 
her like a cocoon.

&quot;What on earth are you doing?&quot;

&quot;COLD.&quot; Came Fujin&#39;s reply as she peeked out from the under the covers.

&quot;Oh now that&#146;s just adorable.&quot; Quistis giggled at her.

&quot;NOT ADORABLE.&quot; She protested in return.

&quot;Sure you&#39;re not.&quot;

Fujin huffed indignantly.

&quot;You seem a chipper mood today, this should be interesting.&quot; Quistis 
smirked as she got dressed.

&quot;CHIPPER?&quot;

&quot;Happy, jolly, jovial.&quot;

&quot;IMAGINING.&quot;

&quot;Un huh.&quot;

&quot;TRUTH.&quot;

&quot;If you say so silly.&quot; She walked over and kissed the little nose that 
poked out from the blankets. &quot;See you later.&quot;

&quot;BYE.&quot; Fujin smiled dreamily.

&quot;I wish I had a camera.&quot; Quistis said laughingly as she finished 
dressing and prepared to leave.

&quot;I&#39;ll see you in class at noon. I&#39;ve planned out a schedule for you; I 
just need to clear it with Cid. Hopefully you&#39;ll only need to take a 
refresher course and a few tests. That should put you in line to 
graduate with this semester with the others. Anyway I&#39;ll go over it this 
afternoon.&quot; She paused and smiled softly.

&quot;Love you...&quot;

She heard Fujin&#39;s muffled response and grinned.

&quot;See you later silly.&quot; With a wave she turned and exited towards the 
elevator.

************************

Quistis walked to her apartment with a growing sense of apprehension. As 
she slowly opened the door visions of a war torn wasteland danced in her 
mind. The first thing she noticed a line of clothes leading to the couch 
and the sound of light snoring. Glancing over it she saw Selphie tucked 
snuggled against Irvine&#39;s chest.

&quot;Guess they made up.&quot; She mumbled, looking around. Thankfully they 
cleaned up, though she would&#39;ve appreciated if they didn&#39;t make out on 
her couch. With a shrug she quickly went to her room to shower and 
change.

After the shower she quietly got dressed and gathered her papers. 
Glancing at the clock she realized she still had several minutes till 
she had to leave.

&quot;Time to wake the love birds.&quot; She thought as she headed into the 
kitchen to get a quick breakfast. Quietly grabbing a croissant and a 
glass of water she headed back to the living room. Without a word she 
sat down on the loveseat opposite the couch and started to eat. A brief 
moment passed before they felt her presence. Selphie was the first to 
wake; sitting up she looked about in confusion.

&quot;Huh?&quot; She mumbled rubbing her eyes and holding the blanket to her 
chest.

&quot;Morning.&quot; Quistis chirped brightly, her eyes gleaming with sarcasm. 
Selphie yelped with a start causing Irvine to sit up abruptly and 
inadvertently sending her to the floor.

&quot;What!?&quot; He babbled incoherently.

Quistis took a soft breath to keep her composure as her two friends sat 
naked in their stupor.

&quot;I take it you two made up?&quot;

&quot;Quistis?&quot; They two squawked exchanging glances.

&quot;Last time I checked.&quot; Quistis smiled dangerously as she sipped her 
coffee.

&quot;Oh um well, we...&quot; Selphie squeaked.

&quot;You two want to get dressed I&#39;m trying to eat.&quot;

&quot;HYNE!?&quot; Irvine blurted in surprise realizing his nakedness. He jumped 
up and gathered his clothes in a mad frenzy&quot;

&quot;Oh shit..&quot; Selphie fumbled for the blanket and covered herself.

&quot;Glad to see you guys cleaned up.&quot;

&quot;Um sure, no problem, it was the least I could do after all I did.&quot; 
Selphie said quietly.

&quot;Um about..&quot; Irvine stammered as he buttoned his pants.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to hear it. You both better be gone when I get home this 
afternoon.&quot; Quistis said bluntly.

&quot;Okay.&quot; Irvine looked sheepish.

&quot;So then, how&#39;d you two make up?&quot;

&quot;Well Squall made us stay and clean up, we got to talking and we just 
kinda...&quot; Selphie shrugged and smiled shyly.

&quot;Okay that&#146;s enough, I get the idea. So you and Celest make up too 
then?&quot;

&quot;Yeah I suppose so.&quot;

&quot;Selphie still isn&#39;t her favorite person but I think they&#39;ll be okay.&quot; 
Irvine said sitting back down.

&quot;I hope that&#146;s the end of this mess.&quot; Quistis said sourly.

&quot;I&#39;ll behave m sorry Quisty.&quot; Selphie slumped with growing shame.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, now go get dressed you perv.&quot; Quistis laughed.

&quot;Aw and here I hoped you where...&quot; Irvine started but the icy looks both 
girls gave him killed the words before they left his mouth.

&quot;As for you Mister Kinneas I assume you won&#39;t be here tonight?&quot;

&quot;No Ma&#39;am, thanks for letting me stay though, oh and um sorry about 
everything.&quot;

&quot;Eh don&#39;t worry about it. By the way you need a tan, your rear nearly 
blinded me.&quot; Quistis said drolly, causing a burst of laughter from 
Selphie.

&quot;That&#146;s just down right mean spirited lady.&quot; Irvine sulked.

&quot;Where did you vanish off to last night?&quot; Selphie asked as she artfully 
got dressed under the cover of the blanket.

&quot;Well seeing as you folks overran my apartment Fujin let me stay at her 
place.&quot;

&quot;Ohhhh did she have skulls and spiders, how about a boiling cauldron?&quot; 
Selphie said with a sly, dark smile.

&quot;You just can&#39;t cut her any slack can you.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;I simply don&#39;t like her nor can I forget what she was a part of.&quot;

&quot;You ever think to give her a chance, she&#39;s changed.&quot;

&quot;Yeah so have Jonna, Christy and Nym they&#39;re all dead now, that&#146;s a 
change and she had a part of it.&quot; Selphie said with a bluntness that 
left Quistis cold.

Irvine caught Quistis&#39;s attention and quietly shook his head for her to 
drop it.

&quot;Okay Selph.&quot;

&quot;Sorry Quisty that&#146;s just how I feel, I can never forgive her or 
Seifer.&quot;

A loud banging on the door startled the lot of them.

&quot;Hyne who the hell is that?&quot; Quistis stared.

&quot;I got it.&quot; Irvine said as he opened the door. Rinoa stood there in 
tears and wringing her hands worriedly.

&quot;Rinoa, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Irvine balked in shock at the sight of her a 
moment before ushering her inside. Quistis and Selphie jumped up as they 
approached.

&quot;It&#39;s Aeka.&quot; She sobbed.

&quot;What, what happened!&quot; Quistis asked sternly, nodding for Irvine to sit 
her down.

&quot;Security found her about a hour or so ago.&quot;

&quot;Found her....&quot; Quistis&#39;s heart grew cold and Selphie&#39;s expression grew 
grave.

&quot;She apparently went to the training area last night alone, I...I don&#39;t 
know what she was thinking.&quot;

&quot;Is she dead..&quot; Quistis asked somberly.

Still freshly upset by the memories of her dead friends Selphie started 
to sob softly. Rinoa shook her head and hitched wearly.

&quot;No, she was able to drag herself out into the hall, they think she 
tangled with a raptor of some sort they found its carcass.&quot;

&quot;At least she killed the bugger.&quot; Irvine pointed out trying to ease 
everyone.

Quistis looked at Irvine sourly then back to Rinoa. &quot;How bad is she?&quot;

&quot;Well she lost a lot of blood, she was able to use a healing spell or 
something of the sort, most of her wounds where superficial when they 
found her.&quot;

Quistis nodded and frowned. &quot;Is she awake?&quot;

&quot;Doctor Kadowaki says the blood loss made her pass out they have her 
transfused but it may be awhile they just hope she doesn&#39;t have any 
lasting damage.&quot;

&quot;I thought those guys had been assigned Guardians? She should have 
called one when she got in trouble.&quot; Irvine asked shaking his head 
dumbfounded.

Rinoa sighed and buried her head in hands. &quot;We have them but Aeka was to 
scared to use summon, she was afraid they&#39;d keep her in the dream world.

&quot;Oh damn it.&quot; Quistis frowned. &quot;What was she thinking? Of all the...&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s been struggling in the physical aspects of the training, while 
you where gone she pretty much made a fool of herself during the first 
trip into the training area. I guess she wanted to prove something to 
herself.&quot; Rinoa said quietly wiping her eyes.

&quot;Poor kid.&quot; Selphie sniffed.

Quistis stood and paced a moment. &quot;Can I see her?&quot;

&quot;Doc says she needs to rest, no visitors until later.&quot;

Irvine went a comforted Selphie who still sat sniffling on the end of 
the couch.

&quot;You guys back together?&quot; Rinoa asked dully in hopes to hear some bright 
news.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Irvine nodded.

&quot;That&#146;s good.&quot;

&quot;Who all knows, about Aeka I mean.&quot; Selphie asked.

&quot;I think Zell was the one to find her, Squall knows of course as does 
Cid and Edea that&#146;s about it so far.&quot;

&quot;Hyne, I hope she&#39;ll be okay. Look guys I have to hurry to talk to Cid 
then get to class, Rinoa if you want to sit out today you can.&quot;

&quot;No, its okay I&#39;ll be there.&quot;

&quot;Kay, Selphie, Irvine lock up please, I&#39;ll see you guys later.&quot; Quistis 
waved as she grabbed her bag and rushed out the door.

*******************************

Zell stood quietly in line at the cafeteria, though he really didn&#39;t 
feel like eating. He didn&#39;t hear Fujin walk up quietly behind him and 
barely heard her when she spoke to him.

&quot;GREETING.&quot; She said blandly.

Looking over his shoulder Zell blinked as if he thought his ears had 
tricked him.

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot;

&quot;Did you say something?&quot;

&quot;DID I?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;THEN YES.&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot;

&quot;YOU ASKED.&quot;

&quot;What the hell are you going on about.&quot; He nearly shouted in 
frustration. Fujin smiled slyly and it sent shivers down his spine.

&quot;What&#39;s with you this morning?&quot;

&quot;NOTHING.&quot;

&quot;Whatever.&quot; He shrugged and turned back around. She was disappointed 
usually he rose to the occasion whenever she messed with him.

&quot;PROBLEM?&quot; She asked curiously.

&quot;Why do you care?&quot; He mumbled sourly.

&quot;DO I?&quot;

&quot;You tell me.&quot;

&quot;DOES IT MATTER.&quot;

&quot;No I guess not.&quot;

&quot;UPSET?&quot;

&quot;If you&#39;re trying to get a rise out of me, just stop it I&#39;m not in the 
mood.&quot; He snapped angrily. Fujin arched a brow and went silent, content 
to let it drop. The line moved and Zell fixed his plate then trudged off 
to find a seat. Having already dismissed the whole conversation Fujin 
did likewise. She had barely had time to sit down and start to eat when 
Zell plopped down heavily in front of her.

&quot;I found one of Quistis students this morning, she&#39;d been nearly mauled 
to death in the training center.&quot; He blurted then stuffed a roll in his 
mouth.

Fujin sat up straight at the abruptness of his arrival and stared.

&quot;Aeka I think her name was, it was horrible there was blood everywhere. 
It reminded me of the war, man it sucked.&quot; Hanging his head he sighed 
heavily.

&quot;SHE LIVE?&quot; Fujin recalled the girl worrying about being strong enough 
to be a seed.

&quot;Yeah, Doc says she&#39;ll prolly be okay? It&#39;s just depressing, but I guess 
you wouldn&#39;t know about that sorta thing. Miss Ice Queen and all, must 
be nice.&quot;

&quot;NOT FAIR.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, I&#39;m just on edge. Look Fujin, since I&#39;m at it I want to 
apologize too for being a complete ass the other day on the Ragnarok. I 
was out of line and I&#39;m sorry. I guess you&#39;re not that bad.&quot; He 
shrugged. &quot;I mean if Miss Trepe says your cool then how can I argue.&quot; He 
grinned hugely and offered his hand. Fujin looked at him doubtfully and 
ignored the gesture.

&quot;Okay I deserve that.&quot; He said gloomily.

&quot;ACCEPTED.&quot; Fujin said with an even and bored tone.

&quot;Whoa you mean it?&quot; Zell said stunned.

Fujin nodded.

&quot;Cool.&quot; He chuckled as they both resumed their meal

**********************

&quot;The past, present and the future are all linked and all the same only 
the circumstances differ, what was, shall always be albeit in a 
different form.

One can hope to alter the flow of things but who&#39;s to say that the new 
shall be better than the old, or if it is even different. We all have 
our place in the scheme of things. What we think is choice or destiny is 
really only our playing our role in history for better or for worse. 
What vain creatures we are to think we can alter the way of the universe 
Ultimecia thought she could but really she two was only a slave to its 
plans as are we all. Time has a tendency to travel in circles, to repeat 
itself. Be one should remember a circle is only a line whose end and 
beginning meet at a juncture.&quot;

&quot;And so it begins..&quot; Edea whispered softly as she looked out from the 
balcony in Cid&#39;s office. Down in the courtyard below Luccian and 
Archibald where attacking each other with growing fervor. A crowd of 
admirers had grown and she made note of each of them since the final 
bell for class had rang more than ten minutes ago. Having seen enough of 
she walked back into the office, where Cid was going over the paperwork 
Quistis had left.

&quot;Decided?&quot; She asked curiously.

&quot;Hmm.&quot; Cid looked up and blinked.

&quot;Fujin.&quot;

&quot;Oh that. Yes I cleared her she should be attending Mr. Oshua&#39;s class on 
group strike tactics and infiltration as well as Miss Trepe&#39;s advanced 
Guardian studies.&quot;

&quot;Not a lot on her plate.&quot;

&quot;She was set to graduate when..&quot; He paused, he didn&#39;t really like to 
bring up the war in conversation with his wife. &quot;She should be fine with 
just some refresher courses. Miss Trepe says she&#39;s more than qualified 
for SEED.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Quistis seems quite fond of the girl.&quot;

&quot;Hmm I noticed, well perhaps Quistis will be a good influence on her.&quot;

&quot;I believe she will.&quot; Edea said knowingly, one of the benefits and 
curses of being possessed by Ultimecia was that she was privy to a 
multitude of facts concerning the future. A fact she kept secret from 
all, she had no desire to change history that was Ultimecia&#39;s folly.

&quot;Something troubling you dear?&quot; Cid asked, seeing the distant look in 
his wife&#39;s eyes.

&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; She said with a thoughtful smile before kissing his cheek.

&quot;That&#146;s was unexpected.&quot; He chuckled.

&quot;To kiss the man I love is unexpected?&quot; She looked at him slightly 
puzzled.

&quot;Well, no... not really, I mean...&quot; He felt his mouth go dry. &quot;You 
hardly... ever since.&quot;

Edea arched a thin brow at him and smiled.

&quot;Dear Cid, ever the man of words.&quot; She chuckled before vanishing through 
the curtains that led to his study.

*************************

Luccian fell back against the wall hard enough to kick up a cloud of 
dust. The crowd oh&#39;d and ah&#39;d at the hit. Though he was slow Archibald 
made up for it with brute power and no small knack for grappling and 
power hits. Luccian had to give him credit for landing a blow much less 
a good one. He stood up and brushed himself off.

&quot;Good hit, I was beginning to wonder how long you was going to let me 
dance around you like that.&quot;

&quot;You talk to much.&quot; Archibald snorted and crouched in anticipation for 
an attack.

&quot;Common now Arch, you&#39;ve never beat me before what makes you think 
you&#39;re going to do it now?&quot;

&quot;Come here and find out.&quot;

Luccian slipped out of his coat and tossed it to a tall woman with raven 
black hair who was watching him lustfully. Smugly he gave her a wink 
then starting paced like a cat waiting to strike. Archibald didn&#39;t 
flinch and waited calmly, he knew Luccians temper was his weakness. He&#39;d 
seen Zell exploit it as did Fujin.

&quot;You think Zell thought you something eh? Well show me what you got.&quot;

&quot;You talk to much.&quot;

&quot;So be it.&quot; Luccian snapped into battle stance that Archibald did not 
recognize he refused to let it trouble him and waited patiently.

&quot; Well boys and girls, nice to see you make out own schedules here at 
Balamb Garden.&quot; Xu yelled in a tone befitting an enraged empress as she 
strode towards the crowd.

Archibald stiffened and glanced at her.

&quot;Aw shit.&quot; He mummbled, Luccian took the opening and charged him. 
Archibald barely had to time register the attack as Luccian&#39;s leaping 
kick caught him in the midsection. A sound something akin to what a 
dying elephant would make issued from Archibald as he fell to his knees.

&quot;What the hell are you doing Luccian.&quot; Xu screamed, pushing him back 
several steps. The gathered students started to slowly disperse.

&quot;NOBODY LEAVES.&quot; She bellowed with a white-hot fury that froze them in 
their tracks.

&quot;Miss Xu.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t give me that crap Luccian, A. what started this. And B. Do you 
have any idea how this looks to the junior students who look up to you 
so called Upperclassmen.

Archibald abruptly vomited causing the circle of people that watched 
turn green and back peddle.

&quot;That&#146;s just great...&quot; She sighed, then pointed to Archibald. &quot;See what 
you did to him. I thought you guys where friends or something.

&quot;Or something.&quot; Luccian chuckled. &quot;Just a friendly sparring match eh 
Arch?&quot;

&quot;Fuck you.&quot; Archibald belched sourly as he struggled to his feet. 
Luccian&#39;s gaze darkened dangerously.

&quot;Last time.&quot; Xu said simply, she emphasized the point by jamming him in 
the chest with her finger.

Luccian smiled.

&quot;Sorry Ma&#39;am.&quot; Luccian bowed.

&quot;Keep it up.&quot; Xu sneered then pointed at Archibald. &quot;You go get cleaned 
up and go to class. As for you.&quot; She looked slowly back at Luccian. 
&quot;Your not to leave the grounds for three weeks.&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot; Luccian snapped.

&quot;Four then.&quot; Xu said simply.

&quot;That&#146;s not fair.&quot;

&quot;Five.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s bullshit!&quot; Luccian tensed, he had the sudden urge to pummel the 
woman for her audacity.

&quot;Six weeks, I can do this all day, care to go for seven big guy.&quot;

Luccian was a ball of trembling rage but kept his mouth shut.

&quot;Glad to see we understand each other.&quot; Xu said with a sharp impersonal 
smile. &quot;Now report to the discipline office you can spend the rest of 
the day there since you are to good to go to class.&quot;

Luccian spun and stormed off, making sure to snatch his coat from his 
admirer. Xu faced the grim faced crowd that remained.

&quot;The rest of you, hand over your ID&#39;s for demerits, oh and your weekend 
passes are revoked.&quot;

*********************

Quistis sat quietly at her desk as the students filtered out her second 
class would arrive shortly and Fujin would be with them.

&quot;This should be interesting.&quot; She tried desperately not to grin, 
something about the sneaking struck her as mischievously fun. She 
wondered how long the two of them could keep their relationship secret. 
Her mirth was short-lived however as her mind went back to Aeka.

&quot;Poor thing, she tries so hard. Simple sad fact is she&#39;s not cut out for 
the SEED program. She&#39;s got the heart and the smarts for it but the cold 
truth was, at barely 5 foot tall and thin as a rake, her body was not 
suited for the rigors of SEED. Selphie could be considered stocky when 
compared to the girl. I&#39;d fail her even though I&#39;d hate it at least to 
keep her from getting hurt. Problem is she is passing, albeit barely.&quot; 
She removed her glasses and rubbed her temples.

&quot;Perhaps she&#39;ll quit consider what happened. It&#39;d be better than her 
getting crippled or worse.&quot; She frowned at the harshness of the thought.

&quot;Miss Trepe!&quot; Strong arms abruptly caught her around the neck in a hug. 
She snapped out of her thoughts and looked. Royce stepped back even 
though he was dark skinned his blushing was readily apparent.

&quot;Sorry..&quot; He said awkwardly. &quot;We kinda missed you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay Royce.&quot; Quistis laughed lightly. &quot;Glad to see you too, go sit 
down I have some news for you guys.&quot;

Royce didn&#146;t much like the grim look on her face as she said that. The 
other students came pouring in some already whispering grimly to each 
other. Most though where in good spirits and the Treppies giggled 
excitedly upon seeing their favorite teacher. Rinoa and Archibald came 
in and took their seats. Rinoa&#39;s eyes met Quistis&#39;s a moment before she 
laid her head on her desk.

Quistis noticed everyone was here but Fujin, just as she was about to 
start worrying half the class looked to the door with mixed reactions.

Fujin walked in with a dull somewhat aloof expression. Standing a moment 
to search out a seat she sat down in the seat that unbeknownst to her 
was usually Luccian&#39;s. Archibald smiled to himself as watched her sit, 
he knew Luccian would have a fit when he returned and the thought 
cheered him considerably as he rubbed his aching stomach.

An unsettling portion of the class was gawking openly at Fujin for 
various reasons. The audacity of her taking Luccian&#39;s seat, The fact 
that she was the one who put him on his ass. Combined with the many 
rumors about her, the time spent as on the disciplinary committee and 
finally her unique and exotic appearance. Fujin ignored them all and 
kicked her feet onto the table to await the start of class.

&quot;Miss Kazeno, do you put you&#39;re feet on the furniture at home.&quot; Quistis 
asked quietly without looking up.

Fujin blanched slightly and put her feet down.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; She said sourly.

&quot;Then kindly refrain from doing so here please.&quot; Quistis said smiling 
appreciably.

Fujin felt like an ass but hid it behind a mask of indifference.

Standing up Quistis moved to the front of her desk and leaned against 
it.

&quot;Okay class. I have some announcements. Let me say I&#39;m glad to be back 
and that I missed you all.&quot;

Claps rang out and Royce whistled merrily.

&quot;Okay settled down, let&#39;s move on. I&#39;d like you to welcome Fujin to the 
class, she&#39;ll be in your class till the end of the semester.&quot;

Rinoa had more important things on her mind to even bat and eye at the 
announcement. The rest of the class gave a somewhat tepid greeting. 
Quistis soured somewhat at her classes behavior but let it go for now.

&quot;Okay now for some bad news.&quot; She sighed and grew somber.

&quot;It was brought to my attention that Aeka had an accident in the 
training center late last night.&quot;

Several gasps of shock issued around the class. Royce grew pale and 
gaunt at the announcement.

&quot;Calm down she&#39;s okay now.&quot; Quistis assured them.

&quot;What happened!?&quot; Royce nearly shouted causing everyone to look in 
surprise.

&quot;She was wounded in combat, she sustained several serious cuts but was 
able to heal them herself. She passed out from blood loss but the Doctor 
says she should be fine.&quot;

Royce sat in stunned silence and several of the girls in the class 
started sobbing quietly.

&quot;Can we see her?&quot; Nei asked, as did several other students.

&quot;Not yet she needs her rest.&quot;

&quot;How long will she be in the infirmary?&quot; Royce added.

&quot;Doc says a day or two most.&quot;

&quot;Will she back in class?&quot; Rinoa asked.

&quot;I honestly don&#146;t know yet.&quot; Quistis sighed regretfully.

&quot;What happened I mean how? Royce fretted.

&quot;I have an idea but I don&#39;t want to say anything until she gets back to 
tell me herself.&quot;

&quot;This is horrible.&quot; Royce frowned in dismay.

&quot;Yes it is, but keep in mind it looks like she&#39;ll recover and that she 
should be on her feet within a few days if all goes well.&quot;

The class breathed a collective sigh of relief and settled a bit.

&quot;Now then.&quot; Quistis said with gentle firmness. &quot;Lets get started on 
today&#39;s lesson. Oh and Fujin I believe I have something for you.&quot;

******************************

Trees exploded into shards of deadly splinters as the vortex ripped them 
apart. The T-Rexsaur staggered back and roared in enraged defiance as 
the debris pummeled it&#39;s. Sweat dripping from her brow, Fujin stood her 
ground, she knew the tornado would not stop the beast, but it did give 
it pause. It had been a long time since last she had joined with her 
guardian force Pandemonia she was thankful for its return. The two 
shared a special bond that was unspoken, combined the two of them 
embodied the very nature of the storm, that was Pandemonia&#39;s calling, 
cold, powerful, chaotic and deadly. Fujin loved the freedom that being 
linked brought, her already impressive speed, grace and dexterity where 
heighten to new levels. The guardian also shared the stigma of being 
different. Peculiar in appearance even compared to the other guardians 
who usually where regal or terrifying.

Pandemonia however was odd, nearly comical being in appearance if not 
for its staggering height. That is until one had to battle the guardian 
force, it wield all the strength and fury of a storm. Fujin now 
harnessed that power and wielded it like a weapon. With a near psychotic 
grin she drew her weapon, a large bladed star that appeared much like a 
pinwheel. It was a sleek and artful weapon, odd and strange, like it&#39;s 
mistress. She charged straight at the beast with a snarl. The T-Rexsaur 
was not impressed and lumbered madly at her, it&#39;s great jaws agape and 
waiting to devour the impudent little thing assaulting it. Fujin used 
her momentum and a gust of wind to propel her through the air she made a 
leap that defied normal logic.

With a speed that was surprising for its size the beast followed her 
trajectory to intercept her. It&#39;s jaws snapped loudly just inches from 
her feet. She could smell the hot rotten stench of meat on it breath as 
she made an impromptu landing atop it&#39;s massive, thickly plated head. 
Immediately it whipped about in an attempt fling her off. Kneeling, 
Fujin locked her hand into a crevice formed by the monsters bony brow 
ridges. Not to be denied the creature ran headfirst towards a tree. 
Fujin looked wide-eyed and quickly tossed her pinwheel skyward to free 
her hand even as she concentrated on a spell. Lightning met her 
outstretched hand and she brought her fist down atop the creature&#39;s 
skull with lightning following it. The explosion so close was deafening 
and she let herself be blown clear. The creature jerked and tensed, as 
its brain was short-circuited even as it smashed headlong into the tree. 
With a bellowing sigh the great beast&#39;s eyes rolled up and it collapsed 
onto it&#39;s side. Fujin pirouetted through the air, catching the falling 
pinwheel in hand as she landed. Walking cautiously she approached the 
beast, it&#39;s breathing was steady even as it lay unconscious from the 
bolt.

&quot;You&#39;re letting it live?&quot; Quistis asked as she stepped into the 
clearing.

&quot;WHY SLAY?&quot;

&quot;Why did you fight it then?&quot;

&quot;NOBLE FOE.&quot;

&quot;Are you serious.&quot;

&quot;YES.&quot;

&quot;You know I already have one student in the infirmary over some need to 
prove herself I&#39;d hate to see another.&quot;

&quot;NO DANGER.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s cocky.&quot;

&quot;TRUTH.&quot;

&quot;Oh aren&#39;t you little Miss bad ass.&quot; Quistis mocked playfully.

&quot;YES.&quot; Fujin smirked.

&quot;You&#39;re incorrigible.&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;PANDA?&quot;

&quot;Um yeah kind of a pet name for him.&quot;

&quot;FEMALE.&quot;

&quot;ASKED.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t know it err she could talk, she never said anything before.&quot;

&quot;No not really.&quot;

&quot;THERE YOU GO.&quot;

&quot;Touch&eacute;, ready to go?&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;I think she looks up to you.&quot;

&quot;AEKA?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;LIKES YOU.&quot;

&quot;Yeah I know but she wants to fight like you.&quot;

&quot;YOU FIGHT.&quot;

&quot;Yeah but I didn&#39;t have as much to overcome as you did, no offense 
intended.&quot;

&quot;UNDERSTOOD.&quot;

&quot;You should talk to her.&quot;

&quot;WHY.&quot;

&quot;Help her, give her advice?&quot;

&quot;LIKE WHAT.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know you tell me.&quot;

&quot;NOT TALKER.&quot;

&quot;I know but you can try something, she&#39;s pretty blue about the whole 
affair.&quot;

Fujin coughed faintly and held up a hand and frowned.

&quot;Sorry got you talking to much.&quot;

&quot;NO WORRY.&quot;

&quot;Come on hon lets go.&quot; Quistis smirked patting her on the rear causing 
Fujin looked at her in shock.

&quot;Oh you love it.&quot; Quistis giggled as they made their way up the path.</pre>
