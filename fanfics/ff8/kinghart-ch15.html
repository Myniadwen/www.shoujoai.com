<p align="center">Dinner and  An Evening Late</p>
<p>“Take it easy now,  ok?” Xu said as she led Quistis down the hall. “I can’t believe  Dr. Kadowaki let you out so early.”</p>
<p>“Yeah well, I  prodded her a little. I told her you could take plenty care of me.”  She replied, leaning on her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Hey! That’ was  uncalled for! You know I have work and so do you as soon as you  recover.” Xu looked at her in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Oh…so that means  that…you don’t love me as much as you do your job?” Quistis  looked up with big doe eyes and Xu felt her resolve crumbling.</p>
<p>“Oh no, I’m not  falling for that.” She said, closing her eyes and turning her head  away. Quistis sniffed slightly and Xu was about to kill herself for  being so responsive to such a dumb trick. She lasted until they got  to her room and then the silence was just too much.</p>
<p>“Alright, alright.  What do you want me to do?” She sighed caving in. Quistis giggled  brightly, knowing how susceptible she was to her “charms.”</p>
<p>“That certainly took  longer than usual. Maybe I’m just losing my skills.” She said.</p>
<p>“Trust me,” Xu  reassured. “You aren’t.”</p>
<p>“Well, well, well,  if it isn’t my favorite instructor.” A chuckled came from near  the corner.</p>
<p>“Seifer.” Xu  hissed with all the contempt in the world.</p>
<p>“The one and only.”  He stepped out and smirked. “Seems to me that you’ve been  injured, what, pray tell, happened?”</p>
<p>“None of your  business, Seifer. Where are the SeeD that are supposed to be guarding  you?” Quistis snapped.</p>
<p>“Oh those  pipsqueaks? I ditched them around the training center. Poor kids  couldn’t handle a couple of T-Rexaurs. How do they expect to handle  Ultimecia then when she arrives?” He shrugged. “But of course,  she’ll have to get us both now won’t she?”</p>
<p>“Can you stand on  your own?” Xu asked. Quistis nodded and let go before she realized  that Xu had every intention on beating Seifer up and throwing him off  a cliff.</p>
<p>“No, wait!” She  said, holding on. “Seifer, how the hell do you know about me?”</p>
<p>“I did a little  eavesdropping on the meeting. Didn’t hurt much, did it? Come on,  shouldn’t people who are destined to share the same fate stick  together?” He placed an arm on her shoulder. Xu resisted jump  kicking him but she knocked his arm off and glared at him, promising  a whole new world of pain if he did it again.</p>
<p>“Remember the last  time we fought?” She hissed. Seifer cocked his head to one side and  tried to remember. As soon as the memory came to him, he grimaced.</p>
<p>“Oh…right. I’ll  be going now. Good evening, Quisty.” He tossed a kiss her way  before walking away. Qusitis looked over at Xu, confused.</p>
<p>“You two fought  before?”</p>
<p>“Caught him in my  room trying to steal answers to a test. He got the wrong room and  well, naturally took the opportunity to try and assault me. It was a  bad move.”</p>
<p>“Is that why he was  out for an entire week?” Quistis replied thoughtfully, remembering  the condition Seifer once came back in. It looked like he had gotten  squashed and clawed by a Behemoth.</p>
<p>“Yeah. That’s the  one.” The moment’s reprieve was cut short by Quistis toppling  over sideways into Xu who stumbled a few feet before regaining  balance and pushing back.</p>
<p>“Phew, you’re  heavy.” Xu remarked. Quistis gave her a look of utter shock and  slapped her on the arm.</p>
<p>“You take that back  you fiend!”</p>
<p>“Let’s get you to  your room.” Xu laughed as Quistis fumed silently.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“You don’t think  that she’s in love with Squall again, do you?” Rinoa asked.</p>
<p>“Stop worrying,  Quistis wouldn’t do that!” Ayane snapped. “You’re both being  much too nosy.” She dove right back into the book she was reading.</p>
<p>“You know, honestly  I think this is the happiest I’ve ever seen Quistis. And after such  a traumatic event too. Something’s up.”</p>
<p>“Here’s a theory,  what if she heard from that Arik guy? What if he’s not really  dead?” Rinoa offered.</p>
<p>“I doubt it.”</p>
<p>“What are you guys  talking about?” Ayane said, finally showing some interest.</p>
<p>“Oh what would you  care? You’re too busy being such a bookworm.” Selphie replied  snootily, tossing her head to the side.</p>
<p>“Come on, this  sounds like it could be reliable.” She pleaded.</p>
<p>“Should we tell  her?” Selphie asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah!” Rinoa  replied. “Only if I get to.” Selphie nodded and Rinoa began.  “Well, you see, it’s like this, Quistis and this one guy, Arik  Mesh, an Instructor here, were dating. She thinks that if he hadn’t  gone away, they would’ve gotten married. But the thing is, he was  shipped away to investigate the happenings at the Island of Hell or  something and he, well, was killed.” Ayane looked thoughtfully for  a moment.</p>
<p>“Something wrong?”  Selphie questioned. Ayane bit her lip.</p>
<p>“I heard about that  incident…the entire team was completely obliterated. But then there  were rumors that not all of them died. It was like a government  conspiracy thing, how instead of shipping them to the Island of Hell,  they took them somewhere else and did horrible things to them or  something.” She replied. Selphie blinked.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I read somewhere in  the newspaper, well, it was a tabloid so I don’t know how reliable  it is but it said that the Galbadian and Esthar government actually  collaborated and tried to develop psychics.”</p>
<p>“Like the incident  with Ellone!” Rinoa piped up.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but the  things is, that project was abandoned, or so it was thought. The  article said that it was illegally funded by the President of  Galbadia to keep developing psychics and they decided that the best  test subjects would be people who had an already developed sense of  junctioning.”</p>
<p>“Aka the SeeDs,  right?” Selphie leaned in as Ayane spoke quieter and quieter.</p>
<p>“Yeah, exactly. So  they set up this entire thing to lure all sorts of SeeDs so that they  could conduct these weird experiments.” She broke out into  laughter. “But really, what a load of rubbish it is!” Selphie  however, sank down in her seat, her eyes dark with thought. Rinoa  turned to her.</p>
<p>“Selphie?”</p>
<p>“What if that  article is right? Maybe we can find this Arik guy again for Quistis.”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding?  Not only is the old stuff but it’s also tabloid! Hello!” Ayane  waved a hand in front of her face. “Let’s think logically here.”</p>
<p>“No, I think we have  something. I’m serious.” Selphie sat up. “Super sleuth Selphie  is on the case!” She stood up and ran out of the library. Ayane and  Rinoa looked at each other.</p>
<p>“What did you do?”  Rinoa demanded. Ayane sighed and folded her arms over her head in  anguish.</p>
<p>“I don’t know…”</p>
<p>-</p>

<p>Zell was completely  unsure of what to do. He had been cornered and was about to be shot  down in the prime of his game.</p>
<p>“Check mate.”  Irvine said, moving his bishop forward.</p>
<p>“Aw come on man! You  know I made that stupid move back there! Come on, can’t you give it  to me? Please? I need the cash to by Aya a present!” Irvine  chuckled and swept the gil off the table before Zell had a chance to  dive for it.</p>
<p>“It’s not my fault  you spent it all on the Ragnarok.” He replied.</p>
<p>“But…but…the  Ragnarok was underfunded! Selphie and I poured all our cash into that  baby to make it what it is! Can’t you show a little sympathy for a  poor guy?”</p>
<p>“Pay check’s in a  week.” Irvine noted.</p>
<p>“Aya’s birthday is  in two days!” Zell followed him pitifully out of the library,  trying his best to cut the cowboy off. “Please, man! I’ll take  anything! I’ll take 50 gil! Come on, spare me something here!”  Irvine kept walking. He cocked his head backwards.</p>
<p>“What do you plan on  buying her anyway?” He asked.</p>
<p>“Well, I wanted to  take her out to dinner and then take her for a ride on the Ragnarok,  you know, watch the stars, cuddle. Play in the snows of Trabia or  something. Something she’d like. Maybe a movie, shopping, what she  wants to do. But the Ragnarok is running on fumes and I’ve got no  money for any of those things! Please? I’ll pay you back!” Irvine  scoffed and tossed his wallet back at Zell.</p>
<p>“You pay me back  every single gil you hear me? It’s only because I’d want to do  the same for Selphie’s birthday.” He ordered. Zell jumped in the  air and cheered.</p>
<p>“SWEET! Thanks man!  I owe you one!”</p>
<p>“Yeah…well hear me  out then.” Irvine walked outside and sat down on the side. He  sighed. “I’m worried about Quistis.”</p>
<p>“Quisty? I thought  Kadowaki said she was fine. Oh…you mean the Ultimecia thing…”  Zell nodded his head. “I’m worried too.”</p>
<p>“I just don’t want  this to happen. We all know Ultimecia’s going to rise and going to  get Quistis no matter what and it sickens me to try and come to terms  with it.” He tilted his head upward to regard the sky. “There’s  got to be something, anything. I mean, it may sound selfish and all  but maybe we could transfer the power to someone else. Anyone but  Quisty.” Zell folded his arms.</p>
<p>“Dr. Odine would  know. He’s done it with Edea, remember?” He replied.</p>
<p>“If it were that  simple. Quistis won’t approve of giving the burden to someone else.  She’s like that, always putting pressure on herself so no one else  has to go through with it. She wouldn’t give the powers away and  have someone else suffer.” Irvine reminded him. Both of them heaved  another sigh. Zell kicked a stone, sending it flying into the air.</p>
<p>“All of this sucks  man. I hate Ultimecia.” He huffed. “I wish she’s just disappear  out of our lives forever. We defeated her once, why does she insist  on coming back!” Irvine leaned back and looked at the clouds. Zell  was right, it did suck to have the witch come back after they had  suffered to stop her once.</p>
<p>-</p>

<p>Quistis walked through  the halls, leaning against the walls for support some of the time.  She wanted to get to Xu’s room, to be near her but in her  condition, it was a task to get out of bed. Sure, Xu had promised to  return but she wondered what she was doing that was taking so long.</p>
<p>“Let’s  see…123…124…here we go. 125.” She arrived at Xu’s door and  knocked. There was a slight scuffle inside that sounded like someone  inside had dropped a dozen or so dishes into the sink. The door  opened.</p>
<p>“Quistis!” Xu  exclaimed, stepping back in surprise.</p>
<p>“Hey, I wanted to  see what you were doing.” She smiled.</p>
<p>“Uh…now’s not a  good time. Now’s really not a good time.” She said, blocking the  entrance when Quistis tried look inside.</p>
<p>“Why? What’s up?”  Quistis stood on her tiptoes to try and peak over her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Come back in 15  minutes, ok?” She asked, refusing to let her see. Quistis frowned  and crossed her arms.</p>
<p>“What are you hiding  from me?” She demanded, tapping her foot. Xu laughed nervously and  shook her head.</p>
<p>“If you put it that  way, it sounds like you don’t trust me.” She stepped aside. “I  was planning to surprise you but it turned out to be the other way  around. Quistis walked in and her eyes widened in shock.</p>
<p>“Oh…oh my.”</p>
<p>“Well, you know, I  did promise you that dinner.” Xu said sheepishly rubbing the back  of her neck. The room glowed in the candle light set on the red satin  covered table. Two glasses rested on either side of the small  chestnut piece as well as two white china plates. In the kitchen,  smells of chicken and vegetables wafted through the small apartment.  Quistis looked at Xu, eyes shining.</p>
<p>“You planned this  for me?”</p>
<p>“No, I planned to  dine with Squall, what do you think?” Xu teased. “Come on, dinner  and an evening late awaits.”</p>
