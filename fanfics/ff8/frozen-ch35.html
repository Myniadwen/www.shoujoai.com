The girl named Aeka lay listless and silent in the hospital bed as 
Quistis and Fujin quietly entered the room.

&quot;Hiya kiddo.&quot; Quistis whispered, kneeling by the bed.

&quot;Hi Miss Trepe.&quot; The girl whispered weakly.

&quot;I told you silly, call me Quistis outside of class.&quot;

&quot;Sorry Quistis, sorry I missed class.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it hon.&quot; Quistis smiled running caring hand over the 
girls brow. Aeka noticed Fujin lurking near the door.

&quot;Fujin?&quot;

&quot;GREETING.&quot; Fujin blurted.

&quot;You came and visited me that&#146;s sweet.&quot; Aeka smiled.

Smiling awkwardly Fujin made a somewhat sour face. Quistis frowned and 
swiped at her playfully.

&quot;Stop making that face.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin backed up defensively.

Aeka giggled and winced.

&quot;I take it she didn&#39;t want to come.&quot;

&quot;Bah.&quot; Quistis scoffed and leaned forward to whisper in the girl&#39;s ear. 
&quot;Can you keep a secret.&quot; She whispered.

&quot;I suppose so.&quot; Aeka grinned.

Quistis cut a sideways glance at her slightly ruffled companion.

&quot;She&#39;s worried about you, sure she seems rough around the edges but 
she&#39;s really a softy at heart.&quot;

Fujin looked at the two with feigned disinterest as they started 
giggling.

&quot;FEELING?&quot; She finally asked to divert the attention from herself.

&quot;I&#39;m okay my leg hurts though.&quot;

&quot;Rightly so, from what I understand you where cut up pretty bad. I&#39;m not 
here to scold you but I must say that was pretty reckless of you hon.&quot; 
Quistis said sternly.

&quot;I know.&quot; Aeka slumped.

&quot;What where you trying to do?&quot;

&quot;Well Matron said I needed to decide on a weapon, and I&#39;m a pretty good 
shot with throwing knifes.&quot;

Fujin made a noise akin to a cough and a chuckle earning scolding looks 
from Aeka and Quistis both. Fujin blinked and looked about nervously.

&quot;INTERESTING.&quot; She said warily.

&quot;Anyway, I wanted to see how good I could do.&quot; Aeka continued.

&quot;By yourself?&quot; Quistis shook her head and frowned at the girl&#39;s 
foolhardiness.

&quot;I know, it was stupid. Last time I went with anyone I got laughed at, 
ya know the whole shoe thing.&quot; Aeka said blushing with embarrassment.

&quot;Okay I get the picture, lets let it go for now.&quot; Quistis sighed shaking 
her head, she did not want to upset the girl after all she&#39;d endured.

&quot;So how are you two doing?&quot; Aeka chirped merrily.

Quistis smiled brightly, almost to the point of being giddy.

&quot;I&#39;m wonderful actually, even more so now that I know you&#39;re okay.&quot; She 
beamed. Aeka scrutinized her teacher intently a moment.

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis looked puzzled.

&quot;Oh nothing.&quot; Aeka whistled then glanced at the brooding figure in the 
corner of the room.

&quot;What about you Miss Fujin, what have you been up to?&quot;

&quot;MISS?&quot; Fujin gave her an askew look.

&quot;What, did I say something wrong?&quot;

&quot;She thinks it makes her sound old.&quot; Quistis said as she sneered cutely 
at Fujin, who only shrugged and regarded the girl

&quot;BETTER.&quot; Fujin said simply.

&quot;Better huh, well if I may say so you seem positively aglow, then again 
it could just be the morning light.&quot; Aeka said smilingly.

Fujin shifted in discomfort. Blushing slightly she turned to examine the 
various asinine medical posters that lined the near wall. With a shrug 
and a massive yawn Aeka pulled the blankets about her.

&quot;You looks like you&#39;re still tired.&quot; Quistis said quietly.

&quot;Yeah Doctor says I will be for a few days.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll let you get back to sleep then. Anything you need before we go?&quot;

&quot;No Ma&#39;am just glad you came to visit. I&#39;m sorry I caused such a 
problem.&quot;

&quot;Nonsense don&#39;t worry about it in the least, you just worry about 
getting better.&quot;

&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am, thanks for coming to visit me.&quot;

&quot;Oh we&#39;re not the only ones Royce and you&#39;re fellow Treppies will be by 
later to visit.&quot;

A nurse poked her head in and smiled apologetically. &quot;Time to go ladies 
she need to get her rest.&quot;

Quistis stood and head to the door.

&quot;Aeka I expect to see you in class in a few days.&quot;

&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;BE SAFE.&quot; Fujin said with a slight smile as she followed Quistis out.

&quot;I need some advice.&quot; Quistis asked as they made their way up the hall.

&quot;CONCERNING?&quot;

&quot;Aeka.&quot;

&quot;UNDERSTANDABLE.&quot;

&quot;I honestly feel she&#39;s at risk to continue the course.&quot;

&quot;IS SHE PASSING?&quot;

&quot;Yes...barely, she aces the class work but she&#39;s failing or barely 
making the grade in all the physical exercises. I fear I need to remove 
her from the course for her own safety. She&#39;s going to end up getting 
hurt. I talked to Cid about it but he says it&#39;s my decision.&quot;

Fujin sighed and shook her head grimly and stopped.

&quot;What is it, you don&#39;t look like you approve?&quot;

&quot;I DO NOT.&quot; Fujin said flatly.

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;SHE IS PASSING?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;SIGNED FOR CLASS?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;HER CHOICE.&quot;

&quot;I know...&quot; Quistis sighed heavily.

&quot;SHE IS ADULT.&quot;

&quot;Barely.&quot;

&quot;KNOWS RISK.&quot;

&quot;I suppose so.&quot;

&quot;TELL HER THEN.&quot;

&quot;Tell her what, I think she&#39;s a failure and should just quit? That&#146;s 
just heartless.&quot;

&quot;SHE&#39;D KNOW YOUR CONCERN.&quot;

&quot;It would break her heart though.&quot;

&quot;TOUGH.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s a little cold Fu.&quot;

&quot;YOU ARE TEACHER.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot;

&quot;CANNOT PLEASE EVERYONE.&quot;

&quot;I suppose this is what they meant when they said I had poor leadership 
skills.&quot; Quistis hung her head and sighed.

&quot;DON&#39;T!&quot; Fujin scolded.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;WILL NOT LET BERATE SELF.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s the truth though...&quot;

&quot;QUISTIS!&quot; Fujin snapped loudly interrupting her, Quistis jumped 
slightly and stared. They held each other&#39;s gaze a long moment, there 
would be know arguing with the woman, Quistis knew that much.

&quot;Your right.&quot; She relented. &quot;Enough doubting myself I have to make the 
hard decisions.&quot;

Fujin&#39;s stern expression softened and she place a reassuring hand on her 
shoulder.

&quot;WILL BE OKAY.&quot;

&quot;Promise?&quot;

&quot;THERE ARE NO PROMISES.&quot; Fujin said with a sad smile.

&quot;We do the best we can then?&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Oh would you please stop saying that. It makes you sound like a robot.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin said simply as she continued her trek up the hall.

Quistis watched her go for a brief moment.

&quot;You&#146;re such a brat.&quot; She said with mild frustration.

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot; Fujin chuckled back.

Quistis growled and moved to catch up.

*************************

Archibald has just fallen asleep when Luccian came bursting into their 
small dorm room.

&quot;DAMN THAT WOMAN.&quot; Luccian raved in a fury, throwing his books into a 
near corner.

&quot;Shut up you ass, I&#39;m still pissed at you.&quot; Archibald grunted and rolled 
over.

&quot;Get over it.&quot; Luccian huffed as he hung his coat and slipped off his 
boots.

&quot;Fuck that, you sucker punched me.&quot;

&quot;Oh quit complaining.&quot;

&quot;It was a sparring match for crying aloud.&quot;

&quot;Sissy should&#39;ve kept his guard up.&quot;

&quot;Screw you, you were scared I was going to beat you.&quot;

&quot;Not on your best day fatass.&quot;

&quot;Oh see, its shit like that is what&#39;s gonna keep me from telling you 
something I learned today.&quot;

&quot;Like I care.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re not wanting to go to those stupid temples?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Never mind, what do I know I&#39;m just a fatass.&quot; Archibald snorted and 
rolled over.

Luccian stood and walked over to his bed.

&quot;Eh no, your going to tell me what your talking about.&quot;

&quot;Nah.&quot;

&quot;Damn it tell me.&quot;

&quot;Nope.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re pissing me off here Arch.&quot;

&quot;Wahh want a bottle?&quot; Archibald snorted mockingly.

Luccian tensed and his hands twitched.

&quot;Alright you win.&quot; He said stiffly.

&quot;Eh what? I didn&#39;t hear that?&quot; Archibald sat up and looked at him with a 
wry smile.

&quot;You win, I apologize.&quot; Luccian stood straight and folded his arms.

&quot;Heh, I thought so.&quot; Archibald nodded.

&quot;Don&#39;t push it.&quot; Luccian said with a glint in his eyes.

&quot;Alright since ya asked me nicely. Zell and Squall are going to the 
islands to look for some critter.&quot; Archibald shrugged.

&quot;Huh what critter?&quot; Luccian looked at him skeptically.

&quot;Hell if I know some dragon for Zell&#39;s girl.&quot;

&quot;How do you know?&quot;

&quot;I overhead em talking at the end of Zell&#39;s class.&quot;

&quot;Interesting.&quot;

&quot;Do you know how they are getting there?&quot;

&quot;The Ragnarok I guess.&quot;

Luccian smiled darkly and nodded.

&quot;When are they going?&quot;

&quot;Next week sometime, what&#39;s the plan.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know yet.&quot; Luccian smiled. &quot;But I&#39;ll think of something. Thanks 
man I owe you one.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah you do.&quot; Archibald said bluntly.

Luccian ignored him as he walked to his bed; he sat down to think. 
Archibald rolled his eyes then went back to sleep.

****************************************

The movie, some drama about two fishermen and the woman they both loved 
has just ended. Rinoa and Nicole sat in quiet contemplation as the 
credits rolled.

&quot;That sucked.&quot; Rinoa said in awe.

&quot;You&#39;re the one who wanted to see it.&quot; Nicole said, sour at having 
wasted her money on the film.

&quot;Okay I&#39;m not perfect.&quot;

&quot;Finally she admits it.&quot; Nicole laughed.

&quot;Feh.&quot; Rinoa scoffed and stood as the theater lights brightened.

&quot;Talk to Quistis today?&quot; Nicole asked as they left.

&quot;Not since class earlier, last time I seen her she was going to see 
Aeka.&quot;

&quot;Oh, how&#39;s she doing?&quot;

&quot;Aeka or Quistis?&quot;

&quot;Both.&quot;

&quot;Aeka will be okay she should be up and about tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s good.&quot;

&quot;As for Quistis I have no idea I&#39;m under the impression she&#39;s still mad 
about us fighting in her apartment.&quot; Rinoa looked down worriedly.

&quot;Yeah I kinda figured she would be, I plan to go apologize later.&quot;

&quot;You and Zell still mad at each other?&quot;

&quot;Nah we made up.&quot;

&quot;Squall hasn&#39;t talked to me since last night. We really embarrassed 
him.&quot;

&quot;I can understand that. What about Selphie and Irvine.&quot;

&quot;No idea, I haven&#39;t seen them since last night and Celest isn&#39;t talking 
to any of us now.&quot;

&quot;Can you blame her.&quot;

&quot;No not really.&quot;

They made their way out of the crowded theater and moving into central 
plaza of Balamb Garden&#39;s recreation center. Nicole watched the people 
mulling about the plaza a moment before regarding Rinoa.

&quot;So what was Fujin doing there I notice she&#39;s been lurking about 
lately?&quot;

&quot;Oh don&#39;t get me started on that again.&quot; Rinoa twitched slightly.

&quot;You&#39;re about as bad as Selphie.&quot;

&quot;Oh please I am not. I&#39;m just worried about Quistis being influenced by 
her.&quot;

&quot;Influenced, you keep saying that, what on earth are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;You know, Seifer made her crazy.&quot;

&quot;Hogwash you&#39;re judging her when you don&#39;t even know her.&quot;

&quot;I know enough to know she&#39;s an emotional predator like Seifer, and 
Quistis is weak enough to be swayed by her.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s just mean spirited.&quot; Nicole looked flabbergasted.

&quot;Oh Nikki lets not get into this again.&quot; Rinoa sighed growing annoyed by 
her friend&#39;s naivet&eacute;

&quot;Fine, let&#39;s drop it.&quot; Nicole said with a slight huff.

&quot;Your birthday is coming up, you and Zell have anything planned yet?&quot;

&quot;Nope, to be honest I think he forgot.&quot; Nicole sighed. &quot;He&#39;s been spacey 
lately.&quot;

&quot;Zell, spacey, Surely not.&quot; Rinoa giggled.

&quot;It&#39;s not funny, oh well what can you do I guess.&quot;

&quot;Aw don&#39;t worry Zell&#39;s a good guy he&#39;ll remember.&quot;

&quot;Yeah I know.&quot; Nicole smiled, he&#39;s been a little upset recently 
something happened between him a Fujin a few days ago that bugged him.

&quot;Oh her again, she a nuisance.&quot;

&quot;No it was Zell&#39;s doing, he hurt her feelings and felt bad about it.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s surprising.&quot; Rinoa blinked.

&quot;Well he does tend to be mouthy.&quot; Nicole shrugged.

&quot;No I meant Fujin having feelings.&quot; Rinoa laughed.

&quot;Heartless.&quot; Nicole sighed shaking her head.

&quot;I was joking, calm down. I don&#39;t know perhaps I&#39;m wrong but I don&#39;t 
think so.&quot; Rinoa frowned and folded her arms.

&quot;Perhaps you need to just talk to her.&quot; Nicole suggested with serious 
glance.

&quot;That would be disastrous, besides she can barely talk.&quot;

&quot;How do you know when you&#39;ve never talked to her.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve talked to her before.&quot;

&quot;When?&quot;

&quot;A couple of times, she answered the door once at Quistis&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Oh that kind of thing doesn&#39;t count.&quot;

&quot;Well.&quot; Rinoa looked thoughtfully a moment.

&quot;Okay fine so I haven&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps it&#39;s time you should.&quot;

&quot;I dunno.&quot;

&quot;Come on.&quot; Nicole said standing up eagerly.

&quot;We&#39;re going to go find Fujin.&quot;

&quot;WHAT!?&quot;

&quot;Come on.&quot; Nicole grabbed her arm and pulled her to her feet.

&quot;This isn&#39;t going to work.&quot; Rinoa protested.

&quot;Sure it will if you at least try.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think...&quot;

&quot;No thinking, just shut up and come on. All three of us will have a nice 
talk at my place watch some movies or something.&quot; Nicole grinned as she 
jostled and prodded Rinoa along.

*****************************

Fujin lay on her side smiling peacefully. Quistis curled against her as 
they recovered from their energetic lovemaking. Looking at the clothes 
scattered about the living room Quistis giggled. Fujin looked at her 
questioningly.

&quot;Poor Irvine just cleaned up to.&quot;

&quot;BAH.&quot; Fujin replied, sweat glistening on her brow. Quistis smirked at 
her and kissed her lovingly.

&quot;You hot.&quot; I&#39;ll go turn on the air.&quot; She said hoping up.

Fujin protested her leaving and tried to grab her. With a playful squeak 
Quistis dodged and ran from her. Sitting up Fujin eyed her cattily 
running a hand through her damp hair.

There was a knock at the door startling the both of them. Their eyes 
locked and the two jumped up searching for clothes. Quistis pulled on 
her skirt and ran a hand through the wasteland that was her hair. Fujin 
was already dressed by time the second knock sounded.

The two looked at each other. Fujin took one look at Quistis with her 
smeared makeup and tangled hair.

&quot;SHOWER.&quot; Fujin said bluntly pointing towards the bathroom.

Quistis looked down at herself and nodded, she started to hurry off then 
paused. The door sounded again and Fujin waved her away.

&quot;Just a sec.&quot; Quistis giggled and moved to her, using her thumb to wipe 
away the lipstick marks that covered Fujin&#39;s face and neck. Fujin 
finished the job with her palm and hurried Quistis to the back room. 
Collecting her self she went to door even as she heard the shower 
starting in the bedroom.

She opened the door and was worried at the expression the two women who 
waited had. Nicole looked at her with a huge grin and Rinoa looked like 
she was going to be nauseous.

&quot;Good there you are!&quot; Nicole clapped gleefully then grabbed her hand.

Fujin&#39;s normal reaction to such a gesture would be a counter attack. She 
didn&#39;t but did visibly twitch visible when Nicole grabbed her.

&quot;WHAT!?&quot; Fujin protested

&quot;You&#39;re coming with us.&quot; Nicole said simply as she pulled her out the 
door.

&quot;LIKE HELL!&quot; Fujin protested and pulled free.

&quot;Lucky for us you were here.&quot; Nicole beamed brightly.

&quot;GO AWAY.&quot;

&quot;Nope, nadda, negative.&quot;

&quot;Just go along with it, she&#39;s a pain in the ass when she doesn&#39;t get 
what she wants.&quot; Rinoa sighed.

&quot;WHERE?&quot; Fujin looked at them warily.

&quot;My place.&quot; Nicole nodded with a grin.

&quot;WHY?&quot;

&quot;So we can all sit down and get to know each other, it seems there is 
some animosity here about and we are going to work through it.&quot;

&quot;FOOLISH.&quot; Fujin snorted and turned to go back inside.

&quot;That&#146;s what I told her.&quot; Rinoa said in agreement.

&quot;Come on Fu, it&#39;ll be fun.&quot; Nicole pleaded. Fujin cringed she hated when 
anyone called her that she only put up with it from Quistis and 
occasionally Raijin. However she knew Quistis would be pleased if by 
some miracle she could get along with her friends.

&quot;HOW LONG?&quot; She sighed, turning back to face them.

&quot;Just a few hours, we&#39;ll sit, talk watch a movie.&quot; Nicole smiled; Rinoa 
meanwhile looked ready to die.

&quot;QUISTIS?&quot; Fujin glanced back at the apartment.

&quot;Nah she would distract everyone.&quot; Nicole smiled apologetically.

&quot;FINE, COME.&quot; Fujin relented, shutting the door behind her she pushed 
past the two and headed up the hall.

&quot;YAY!&quot; Nicole clapped and ran after her with Rinoa in tow.

&quot;This isn&#39;t going to work.&quot; Rinoa grumbled weakly.

Inside Quistis walked out of the shower with her hair wrapped in a towel 
and dressed in a housecoat.

&quot;Who was it?&quot; She said looking about and realized she was alone.

&quot;Where&#39;d she go?&quot;

***********************************

The Ragnarok had become the unofficial mascot of Balamb Garden. 
Something about the ship seemed alive and its appearance didn&#39;t help it 
any.

Nor did the fact that its advanced computer systems seemed to have a 
life of their own. Zell believed the ship was in someway intelligent, of 
course he didn&#39;t tell anyone, content to keep it his secret. He sat 
alone in the darkened hanger perched atop the ships great clawed feet as 
he nibbled a sandwich idly. He&#39;d spent the last few hours cleaning the 
ship and doing minor maintenance. Even though he was grounded for the 
fiasco at the resort he still liked to visit the ship.

&quot;Been a helluva week.&quot; He said thoughtfully looking up at the ships 
draconic head.

&quot;You.&quot; He pointed at the craft with sandwich in hand. &quot;You&#39;ve got it 
made, you get to sit and chill down, here no one to bother you. Every 
now and then fly about, see the sites, comeback get cleaned up and hang 
out for the night. Me on the other hand, I get to tend a class full of 
newbies who think they know what they&#39;re doing. Get punched in face and 
kicked in the nads by my friend, get yelled at by my girlfriend. Honk 
off Miss Trepe for not being nice to some albino nightmare who hates my 
guts and threatened my family.&quot;

He sighed and scratched his head, looking up for any suggestions but the 
Ragnarok ruby tinted eyes held none.

&quot;I know what you&#39;re thinking, I complain to much and should just let it 
ride.&quot;

Still no answer from the ship, the only sounds where the hum of Balamb&#39;s 
engines and his own idle chatter.

&quot;Feh.&quot; He scoffed and stuffed the remainder of his sandwich in his 
mouth.

&quot;Ya know sometimes I think.&quot; He grumbled with a mouthful of food.

&quot;I think we take things way more serious than we should, me included. 
Yeah, yeah I know. Me, serious, surely I&#39;m joking right. Truthfully 
though.&quot; He swallowed and belched nosily.

&quot;Scuse me. Anyway like I was saying I can be serious, I&#39;m serious about 
Nicole she the most important part of my life. The SEED&#39;s, I take that 
seriously too.&quot; He stood up and punched the hydraulic leg of the ship 
like it was an old friends arm.

&quot;So I&#39;m going to try to be like you old buddy. Just chill and go with 
the flow, not gonna let this mess with Fujin, Celest, Irvine, all of it, 
I&#39;m not gonna let it bother me.&quot;

A mild rumble echoed through the craft startling him a moment. He 
assumed it to be hydraulics settling and smirked.

&quot;Glad to see you agree. Well pal I gotta go, hopefully I won&#39;t be 
grounded much longer and I can take you out again soon. Either way you 
Squall and me are goin on a trip next week, I guarantee it will be 
exciting.&quot;

With that he hopped off the foot of the ship and walked cheerfully out 
of the hanger. He didn&#39;t notice as the Ragnarok tilted its head to watch 
him leave.

*********************

Rinoa and Fujin sat on the oversized and garish couch that dominated the 
living room of Nicole&#39;s and Zell&#39;s apartment. Nicole meanwhile was 
kneeling behind the large projection television that sat before them.

&quot;This thing never works right.&quot; She grumbled as she fidgeted with the 
cables.

&quot;A PITY, GOODNIGHT.&quot; Fujin stood to leave. Rinoa made no attempt to stop 
her.

&quot;Fujin sit back down this instance.&quot; Nicole scowled from behind the TV.

&quot;Do it for Quistis.&quot; Fujin told herself and with a huff fell back onto 
the couch. The TV flickered and came to life, Nicole gave a triumphant 
shout and bounded back couch and plopped down between her two guests.

&quot;What movie are we watching.&quot; Rinoa asked dryly.

&quot;Strawberry Fields.&quot; Nicole beamed and Fujin cringed at the name alone.

&quot;Whoa is that the one with Brad Cruise in it!?&quot; Rinoa squeaked 
excitedly.

&quot;Yup he&#39;s a stud.&quot; Nicole giggled and wiggled in her seat. &quot;Don&#39;t you 
think Fujin.&quot; She elbowed her playfully. Fujin looked dully at the 
screen and thought of Quistis and prayed her love would see her through 
such dark times.

&quot;YIPPIE.&quot; She said with an enthusiasm befitting a drunken sloth.

**************************

Squall was actually bored, he had tried to go sit up on the bridge to 
enjoy the view. Nida chased him off with talk about was his blossoming 
relationship with Xu and the inner workings of Balamb&#39;s flight system. 
He had went to the recreation center&#39;s pool to do some swimming but was 
put off by a gang of female students who followed his every move with 
hungry eyes. He had pretty much given up hope when he saw Zell jogging 
by in a far hallway.

&quot;ZELL!&quot; He called before he realized it. Zell peeked back around the 
corner quizzically.

&quot;Someone call me?&quot;

&quot;Over here.&quot; Squall motioned and walked to greet him.

&quot;What are doing roving about boss?&quot; Zell asked idly.

&quot;Exercise.&quot;

&quot;Okay then....what&#39;s up?&quot;

&quot;When did you want to go?&quot; Squall asked, he wasn&#39;t sure why he called 
him over here so he had to think up something on the fly.

&quot;Huh where?&quot; Zell made a confused expression.

&quot;Nicole&#39;s dragon, the Isle of Heaven.&quot;

&quot;Ohhhh that. Well hmm.&quot; Zell stuffed his hands in his pockets and looked 
up thoughfully.

&quot;Well?&quot; Squall prodded.

&quot;How about three days from now, that will give me time to see if I can 
get off probation. If not you&#39;ll be the one flying.&quot;

&quot;Great.&quot; Squall rolled his eyes.

&quot;Where&#39;s everyone at by the way? Nicole and Rinoa should be back from 
the theater by now it&#39;s getting kinda late.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Squall shrugged blandly.

&quot;Dude you need coffee, I&#39;m falling asleep just talking to you.&quot; Zell 
smirked.

&quot;Whatever.&quot; Squall waved him aside and turned to leave.

&quot;Aw man I&#39;m just yanking yer chain don&#39;t go and pout.&quot; Zell called as 
Squall shuffled off up the hall.

&quot;Oh for the love of.. I give up.&quot; Zell threw his hands in the air in 
frustration and went on his way.

Stopping by the student lounge Squall got a bag of chips and a soda from 
the vending machines and sat down for a snack. He had just gotten 
started when Celest and a few other female students walked in. All of 
them wore short shorts and tank tops. Although Celest&#39;s seemed at least 
two sizes to small and hugged her exaggerated curves like a second skin. 
Like her brother she was tall and slender and also like Kinneas she was 
a charmer by nature. Squall quietly prayed that she not see him, having 
no desire deal with her at the moment. The group laughed and pushed each 
other about as they got their drinks.

One of the girls fumbled the volleyball she carried. I hit the floor and 
made a b-line straight towards the skulking leader of Balamb. Celest 
turned and saw him hunkered low in his chair.

&quot;Hey sugar.&quot; She beamed and walked over to him bouncily. The other girls 
giggled madly and rushed out into the hall eager to get to their game. 
Squall waved feebly at her. They both leaned to get the ball and their 
hands met awkwardly. Squall looked up startled only to be face to face 
with Celest&#39;s ample cleavage. He made a idiotic noise and gulped

&quot;My head&#39;s up here hon.&quot; Celest giggled as she raised up cradling the 
ball. Squall bolted upright and felt himself blushing. He had a 
brilliant urge to punch himself unconscious rather than put himself 
through this.

&quot;What are you doing sitting all by your lonesome?&quot; She cooed.

&quot;Eating.&quot; He said frowning.

&quot;I can see that sugar, I meant where is Rinoa?&quot;

&quot;Movie.&quot;

&quot;Un huh, I see.&quot; Celest smirked and nibbled the tip of her finger 
thoughtfully.

&quot;If you&#39;re bored, we&#39;re about to go play a few games of volleyball if 
you want to come watch. You can cheer for me from the sidelines, bring 
me good luck.&quot; She winked at him prettily. Squall sipped his drink 
trying to pretend he wasn&#39;t unsettled.

&quot;No thanks.&quot; He choked and took another drink.

&quot;Okay then hon your loss.&quot; She turned to leave and turned back to look 
at him. &quot;Do know the time?&quot;

Squall tilted his wrist to check his watch and promptly pour his drink 
in his lap. Jumping up with a shout he wiped madly at his crotch. Celest 
smirked and shook her head.

&quot;I think I&#39;ll be going now sugar before you hurt yourself, see you 
around tiger.&quot; She giggled and sauntered off leaving him standing 
annoyed and sticky.

&quot;DAMN IT.&quot; He cursed under his breath and grabbed a handful of napkins.

************************

The movie had been three hours of clich&eacute; romance sprinkled with a 
multitude of gratuitous butt shots of the leading man, each of which 
prompted a schoolgirl giggle from her two companions.

&quot;I love that movie.&quot; Rinoa sniffled as the credits rolled.

&quot;Better than that turkey you made me sit through earlier.&quot; Nicole 
laughed.

&quot;How was I to know.&quot; Rinoa protested weakly.

Fujin stood and headed for the door.

&quot;Hey, hey, hey where are you going.&quot; Nicole hopped up.

&quot;LATE.&quot; Fujin said in annoyance.

&quot;Not so fast, we are going to sit and have a nice long talk.&quot; Nicole 
said firmly. The door opened and Zell walked in whistling merrily.

&quot;Hey Fujin what&#39;s up?&quot; He said brightly and walked past without a second 
thought.

&quot;GREETINGS.&quot; She said somewhat taken aback.

&quot;What are you ladies up to?&quot; He asked as he dug through the 
refrigerator.

&quot;Oh just sitting around talking.&quot; Nicole smiled, moving behind Fujin 
leaning on the door to bar her exit.

&quot;Talk huh.&quot; Zell warily looked to each of the girls in kind.

&quot;Okay then have fun.&quot; He abruptly shrugged and smiled. &quot;I&#39;m gonna take a 
shower and hit the sack.&quot;

&#39;Night hon sleep tight.&quot; Nicole sang out as he closed the door to their 
bedroom. &quot;Well now.&quot; She clapped her hands together. &quot;What shall we talk 
about?&quot;

Fujin rolled her eye and sat down heavily on the couch. Rinoa scowled 
and scooted away from her. Nicole sat down on the floor before the two 
girls.

&quot;Okay enough pleasantries then, what the heck is wrong with you two?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s a trouble maker.&quot; Rinoa huffed glaring at Fujin hotly. This came 
as news to Fujin who looked at her sourly.

&quot;What makes you think that?&quot; Nicole asked.

&quot;She just is.&quot; Rinoa said matter of factly.

&quot;Fujin what do you think of that?&quot; Nicole looked to Fujin who sat back 
impassively, she was not about to let this bother her any further.

&quot;No answer.&quot; Nicole sighed and regarded Rinoa.

&quot;She&#39;s a malicious and evil woman, just like Seifer.&quot; Rinoa said 
pointedly.

&quot;SEIFER&#39;S MALE.&quot; Fujin chuckled lightly.

&quot;You know what I mean!&quot;

&quot;Okay calm down you two.&quot; Nicole interjected. &quot;Rinoa I don&#39;t think Fujin 
is out to hurt anyone, why would she?&quot;

&quot;Because she&#39;s just plain mean, Quistis is an idiot for trusting her.&quot;

No one even had time to register the move as Fujin backhanded Rinoa in 
the mouth sending her flying backward over the couch. Nicole jumped up 
horrified and looked at Fujin with fear in her eyes.

&quot;WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?&quot; She screamed. Zell rushed out of the bedroom 
wrapped in a towel and drooling toothpaste. He saw Rinoa laying 
unconscious on the floor and looked up angrily.

&quot;Damn it what happened?&quot; He shouted kneeling by her.

Fujin frowned and looked to Nicole regretfully.

&quot;I WILL GO.&quot; She walked to the door quietly.

&quot;You&#146;re a monster, and to think I tired to be your friend. Get out of my 
home.&quot; Nicole said coldly then ran to Rinoa&#39;s side

&quot;I APOLOGIZE.&quot; Fujin offered with a sigh. No one even looked at her. 
Hanging her head sorrowfully she left without another word.

*************

Fujin found herself standing outside Quistis&#39;s apartment wanting 
desperately to be near her.

&quot;Not a good idea.&quot; She thought sadly.

&quot;Rinoa was right I&#39;m not better than Seifer.&quot;

&quot;A monster.&quot; Nicole&#39;s words echoed in her mind and she slumped weakly 
against the door. Wiping her eye with her palm she sighed sadly as she 
walking away into the night.</pre>
