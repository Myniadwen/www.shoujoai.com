Dawn, a quiet spring morning, the kind associated with butterflies and 
dandelions. Life was moving on in Balamb Garden, the new students 
hurried to classes while the great academy hovered lazily over the plush 
green plains on the outskirts of the city of Timber. Outside the garden 
sat a small shuttle, ragged, old, a patchwork of repairs and prayers, 
somehow though, it still managed to be serviceable. Seifer frowned in 
dismay at it.

&quot;No way I&#39;m flying around in that thing.&quot; He grumbled, setting down his 
gunnysack.

&quot;Hey, this is my pride and joy, don&#39;t go knocking her.&quot; Raijin frowned.

&quot;It&#39;s a beautiful ship Ray.&quot; Quistis said personably, trying to diffuse 
any potential trouble.

&quot;Are you sure you want to do this...&quot; Rinoa sniffed, looking to Celest 
who looked wild and radiant, her hair blowing loose in the wind under 
the cover of one of her brothers&#39; prized cowboy hats.

&quot;Hey gal, don&#39;t start getting weepy on me, you&#39;ll get me started.&quot; 
Celest grumbled, hugging her gently.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re going...&quot; Selphie mumbled, sitting in a wheel 
chair next to Quistis&#39;

&quot;I have to find my own way.&quot; Celest explained sadly.

&quot;But with him...&quot; Irvine growled, eyeing Seifer venomously. Seifer, not 
wishing to make matters worse simply gave him a solemn look and turned 
away.

&quot;You let us know if need help.&quot; Xu offered firmly, with Nida nodding in 
agreement.

&quot;I will. You two just keep this place running while I&#39;m gone.&quot; Celest 
winked as she passed the rest of her things to Seifer.

&quot;RECONSIDER.&quot; Fujin said gruffly, stepping towards the tall redhead.

&quot;I&#39;ve made up my mind you guys; please don&#39;t make this harder than it 
already is.&quot;

&quot;WILL HURT YOU.&quot; Fujin whispered, her gaze penetrating in its intensity.

&quot;I know...&quot; Celest whispered, stepping away from her. Fujin stared 
silently for a long while trying to comprehend. Then with a look of sad 
regret she turned and went back to Quistis side.

&quot;Why the sad faces?&quot; Miguel asked, carrying an armload of boxes. &quot;This 
is a time of celebration. One of your own is leaving the nest, be proud, 
be happy.&quot; He chuckled, handing his load to Raijin before turning back 
to wave at a small troupe of women waving and calling out to him.

&quot;Can you believe this guy?&quot; Zell mumbled, looking over his shoulder at 
the women as he walked towards Celest.

&quot;Take care of yourself girl.&quot; He smiled, giving her warm hug.

&quot;You too tiger.&quot; She winked then gave his rear a firm, two-handed 
squeeze.

&quot;Hey!&quot; He blurted blushing brightly.

&quot;Whoa.&quot; Nicole gawked then started forward.

&quot;Sorry Nikki.&quot; Celest giggled waving brightly. &quot;I always wanted to do 
that, please forgive me.&quot;

&quot;Oh, you hussy.&quot; Nicole smirked; yanking Zell away then turned to face 
her with a feigned frown. &quot;Come here.&quot; She chuckled, hugging the other 
woman tightly.

&quot;I&#39;ll miss you Nikki.&quot; Celest sighed sadly.

&quot;I&#39;ll miss you too you tramp.&quot; Nicole giggled with tears in her eyes. 
&quot;Just promise me you&#39;ll be safe...&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot;

&quot;Well, child.&quot; Cid said warmly as he made his way forward. &quot;This isn&#39;t 
normally something I&#39;d give as a gift, but considering where you&#39;re 
going I thought it best to give you something useful.&quot; He explained 
sheepishly as he held out a sleek, finely crafted rifle, though it 
appeared antique, she recognized it for what it was.

&quot;Oh my...&quot; Celest gawked. &quot;I can&#39;t take this.&quot;

&quot;Nonsense.&quot;

&quot;But this was yours.&quot;

&quot;True, true, but it&#39;s not like I have anymore use for it. I&#39;ve kept her 
in good shape, she&#39;ll serve you well.&quot;

&quot;But Sir.&quot;

&quot;Ah, ah, no buts.&quot; Cid scolded her. &quot;You keep her clean and well 
maintained she&#39;ll never fail you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you Sir, I&#39;ll treasure it.&quot;

&quot;You never gave me anything like that.&quot; Irvine gawked.

&quot;It&#39;s because I&#39;m special.&quot; Celest giggled, as she hugged Cid 
graciously.

&quot;Take care child.&quot; He smiled, stepping back as Squall moved forward.

Celest&#39;s eyes grew large and mischievous as he approached.

&quot;Be careful out there.&quot; Squall said firmly, putting a hand on her 
shoulder.

&quot;Oh hon don&#39;t be so formal she smirked then grabbed him in a hug. Squall 
sighed and accepted it politely before regarding her blandly.

&quot;Please don&#39;t grab me.&quot; He sighed, sensing what she was about to do.

&quot;Oh you&#39;re no fun.&quot; Celest giggled releasing him.

&quot;Yeah, I know, she doesn&#146;t let me out much.&quot; He smirked, glancing over 
his shoulder at Rinoa.

&quot;Hey, are you talking about me?&quot; Rinoa squawked.

&quot;Never you mind.&quot; Celest laughed.

&quot;See you around.&quot; Squall chuckled, stepping away.

&quot;Celest, leave him alone.&quot; Quistis called out laughingly.

&quot;Quisty!&quot; Celest squealed merrily, scampering forward to hug her 
tightly.

Quistis laughed and returned the embrace.

&quot;Have fun, don&#39;t let those guys drive; you crazy.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t!&quot; Celest winked, then looked to Fujin.

&quot;You take care of her alright.&quot;

Fujin nodded, allowing a faint smirk to cross her stony expression.

Ellone, who stood watching the exchanges with quiet fascination, was 
surprise when Celest rushed towards her.

&quot;Why are you hiding over here, come here.&quot; Celest laughed, hugging her.

Startled, Ellone laughed awkwardly.

&quot;Calm down hon, you need get out more, perhaps you should come with us.&quot;

&quot;Ohhh no, I&#39;m no adventurer.&quot; Ellone blushed.

&quot;So you say.&quot; Celest winked. &quot;Catch you later.&quot;

&quot;Bye.&quot; Ellone smirked, waving enthusiastically. Finally, with her rounds 
complete, Celest moved to Irvine who stood tall and imposing as she 
approached.

&quot;Bro...&quot;

&quot;Sis.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going to miss you. I wish you weren&#39;t going.&quot;

&quot;I know...&quot; She sighed, looking down at her feet sullenly.

&quot;Look...&quot; Irvine sighed, putting a hand on her shoulder. &quot;I love you, 
and I want what&#39;s best for you, but you&#39;re right, you have to make your 
own choices...&quot;

&quot;Irvine...&quot;

&quot;Shush gal, let me finish.&quot; He sighed, closing his eyes to steady 
himself. &quot;Just remember, no matter what happens, you&#39;ve a family here, a 
place to come to if things go bad.&quot;

&quot;I know that...&quot;

&quot;Still, I just want to make sure. You behave, and don&#39;t let that bastard 
push you around.&quot;

&quot;I can handle him.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...I guess you can...&quot; He sighed, hugging her close to him.

Selphie, overcome with emotion burst into a rowdy round of tears and 
that enveloped both Nicole and Rinoa.

&quot;Aw jeeze.&quot; Celest sniffed, pulling away from Irvine who had his own 
trouble keeping from being misty-eyed.

&quot;Love you bro.&quot; She smiled, punching him in the shoulder playfully.

&quot;See ya kiddo.&quot; Irvine smiled, tilting his hat.

With that, Celest turned away and walked slowly to the shuttle where 
Seifer greeted her. Forgoing any good-byes of his own, Seifer quietly 
followed her inside.

&quot;It has been a great pleasure meeting all of you.&quot; Jaya smiled, hugging 
everyone cheerfully. &quot;I do hope we meet again.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure we will.&quot; Quistis waved cheerfully as Miguel lumbered forward 
to shake Zell&#39;s hand.

&quot;You are a good man.&quot; The large wanderer said solidly. &quot;May you have 
many children and your line grow strong.&quot;

&quot;Uh...yeah uh, you too big guy.&quot; Zell grinned, shaking the man&#39;s hand 
awkwardly.

&quot;Children?&quot; Quistis smirked, as Nicole eyed him thoughtfully.

&quot;Who me!?&quot; He stammered. &quot;No way man, not any time soon.&quot;

Miguel laughed loudly and clapped him firmly on the shoulders nearly 
staggering him. &quot;Farewell all of you!&quot; He bellowed the bounded into the 
shuttle with Jaya following excitedly behind.

With everyone aboard, only Raijin remained and his shoulders slumped 
visibly as he turned to face Fujin. She in turn stood tall and placed 
her hands behind her back, assuming a military stance.

&quot;Well, this is it.&quot; He said quietly, walking towards her.

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Seems you made quite a place here for yourself.&quot;

Fujin nodded solemnly.

&quot;I&#39;m glad, you deserve it.&quot; He smiled warmly, then nodded to the crowd 
behind her. &quot;Quistis, these guys, they&#39;re good people, they&#39;ll take care 
of you. Better than I did ya know.&quot; He said quietly. Fujin&#39;s features 
twitched slightly but she kept a look of stern seriousness.

&quot;Well I won&#39;t drag this out, I hate long good-byes ya know.&quot;

Fujin nodded but kept quiet.

&quot;Ray...&quot; Quistis said quietly.

&quot;You get well Miss Trepe; I&#39;m sure you two have a lot to catch up on.&quot; 
Raijin smiled warmly.

&quot;I will, you look after Celest for us okay.&quot;

&quot;Promise.&quot; He winked, then looked to Fujin one last time. &quot;See you.&quot; He 
smiled then turned to leave. Tentatively, Fujin reached out and grasped 
his hand.

&quot;Huh?&quot; He mouthed, slightly startled.

&quot;RAIJIN.&quot; She said stiffly, her features trembling slightly as she 
awkwardly pulled him into an embrace.

&quot;Love you...&quot; She whispered softly, her voice barely audible. Raijin&#39;s 
expression spoke volumes but he kept himself in check as he returned the 
hug quietly. After a brief moment the two separated and Raijin smiled 
hugely then ran towards the shuttle without another word. Moments later, 
they were gone, heading over the horizon to whatever fate had in store 
for them.

As the crowd dispersed quietly Ellone made her way over to Fujin and 
Quistis.

&quot;You&#39;re lucky.&quot; She said absently.

&quot;PARDON?&quot; Fujin asked, having no idea what she was talking about.

&quot;Your brother. It&#39;s good that you two are close.&quot;

Fujin chose forgo any comment and simply folded her arms.

&quot;I wish Squall and I were closer. He seems not to want to have anything 
to do with me.&quot;

&quot;Ellone that&#146;s not true, Squall&#39;s just a private person, he&#39;s like that 
with everyone.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so, he&#39;s mad at me.&quot;

&quot;NONSENSE.&quot; Fujin huffed.

&quot;Fujin&#39;s right, I can&#39;t believe you think that of him.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s mad at me for leaving him alone all those years ago.&quot;

&quot;You had no choice in that. He knows that now.&quot;

&quot;I know... still though, I imagine it&#39;s hard for him to wash all those 
years of anger away.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps...&quot; Quistis relented. &quot;Have you ever tried to talk to him about 
it?&quot;

&quot;I have, several times actually, but he&#39;s evasive and ends up storming 
off.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot;

&quot;Me too...&quot;

&quot;TIME.&quot; Fujin offered.

&quot;I hope so. It hurts to think my own brother hates me so.&quot;

&quot;Ellone.&quot; Quistis said firmly. &quot;Squall doesn&#39;t hate you; he just has 
issues to work through. Fujin&#39;s right, just give him time.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, I suppose.&quot; Ellone sighed heavily.

&quot;Okay, lets be honest here...&quot; Quistis continued, taking on a hushed 
whisper. &quot;I think, he blamed himself for you leaving, perhaps he thought 
you left because he was so dependent on you, if I recall correctly, he 
was awfully clingy. Either way, I think he&#39;s mad at himself, not you and 
now, now that he&#39;s knows the truth, he has to reexamine himself.&quot;

&quot;I hope your right...&quot; Ellone mumbled sadly.

&quot;It&#39;ll be okay, I&#39;m sure of it. Try talking to Rinoa; perhaps she has 
some insight on the matter.&quot;

&quot;I may do that, thanks.&quot;

&quot;My pleasure.&quot; Quistis grinned as the young woman hurried off.

&quot;TORMENTED.&quot; Fujin observed quietly.

&quot;We all are at some point.&quot; Quistis responded sagely.

***************************

Later that evening, Quistis and Fujin stopped in to visit Selphie and 
the baby who were now safe at home and settled in.

&quot;Quisty hi!&quot; Selphie smiled upon opening the door.

&quot;Why are you up running about, Kadowaki said you need to recover.&quot;

&quot;Oh please, I&#39;m fine; you all act like I&#39;m made of glass.&quot; Selphie 
giggled.

&quot;SMELL?&quot; Fujin frowned upon entering.

&quot;That would be Irvine...&quot; Selphie winced.

&quot;ROADKILL?&quot;

&quot;I wish...he&#39;s making some of his homebrewed chili or something of the 
like.&quot;

&quot;I thought we all agreed that...&quot; Quistis started but paused when Irvine 
peeked around from the kitchen. &quot;Fu, Trepe, how are you ladies doin.&quot;

&quot;FUJIN.&quot; Fujin corrected him sourly.

&quot;Yeah, whatever.&quot; Irvine chuckled walking towards them with a steaming 
pot. Fujin eyed it warily and backed up slightly.

&quot;Hey, try this.&quot; He asked, offering a ladle out to the trio of women.

&quot;No spicy stuff for me hon, remember.&quot; Selphie reminded him.

&quot;Ah hell I forgot.&quot; Irvine frowned.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin quickly said before he even had a chance to offer.

&quot;Heck girl, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing.&quot;

&quot;GOOD THING.&quot;

&quot;Fujin, be nice.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;Ah see, Miss Trepe has manners. Take a bite Quisty.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Oh my...&quot; Quistis winced; the spicy fumes making her eyes flutter 
as the ladle neared her.

&quot;Irvine, I shouldn&#39;t, really...I um ate already.&quot;

&quot;QUISTIS, BE NICE.&quot; Fujin snorted snidely.

&quot;Oh, you...&quot; Quistis hissed under her breath. &quot;Fine, okay...&quot; She 
sighed, leaning forward in her chair to sample to offering.

&quot;Well?&quot; Irvine smirked proudly. Quistis&#39; ability to hold a reasonably 
human expression was a testament to her training and self control. 
Gradually though, as the realization that the chili wasn&#39;t that bad 
brought a look of surprise to her face.

&quot;Wow...I&#39;m impressed.&quot; Quistis remarked. &quot;That&#146;s not bad, pretty good 
actually. She marveled then paused as the burning aftertaste began to 
take hold. &quot;Oh!&quot; She huffed, eyes watering. &quot;Oh!&quot; She sputtered again 
then began to hiccup while tears streamed from her eyes.

&quot;QUISTIS?&quot; Fujin frowned in dismay.

&quot;Hot...&quot; Quistis wheezed after a moment.

Irvine chuckled proudly. &quot;She&#39;s got a kick don&#39;t she.&quot;

&quot;Dying...&quot; Quistis gawked, pawing at Fujin&#39;s arm feebly.

&quot;Oh quit being so melodramatic.&quot; Irvine laughed, taking his concoction 
back into the kitchen.

&quot;Lordy....&quot; Quistis finally managed hoarsely as Selphie motioned Fujin 
to wheel her into the living room.

&quot;Where&#39;s Edea?&quot; Quistis asked curiously, fanning herself.

&quot;Over here in her crib.&quot; Selphie cooed, gently cradling the child into 
her arms. Edea yawned cutely and stared at the trio wide eyed.

&quot;Want to hold her?&quot; Selphie offered, looking to Fujin.

Fujin looked aghast at the thought.

&quot;Aw go ahead.&quot; Quistis grinned.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Oh don&#39;t be such a poop.&quot; Selphie frowned.

&quot;CLUMSY.&quot;

&quot;You are not.&quot; Quistis laughed.

&quot;Here.&quot; Selphie laughed, passing her the baby.

&quot;WAIT, HOW, WHAT?&quot; Fujin babbled awkwardly.

&quot;Oh silly, here let me show you.&quot; Selphie giggled, positioning her arms.

Edea seemed unimpressed and yawned anew.

&quot;There you go.&quot; Quistis smiled warmly. &quot;I wish I had a camera.&quot;

&quot;SHUSH.&quot; Fujin scowled at her then looked down quietly at the baby.

Selphie noticed Irvine standing in the kitchen doorway with a look of 
concern. Quietly making her way to him she smiled cutely.

&quot;Now that&#146;s adorable.&quot; He smirked.

&quot;Ain&#39;t it though.&quot;

&quot;Surprised you trusted her to do that.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Selphie smiled, hugging his arm snuggly.

Fujin bounced gently with the child in her arms as Quistis looked on in 
amusement.

&quot;You&#39;re a natural.&quot; She remarked as Fujin paced slightly.

&quot;GOOD CHILD.&quot;

&quot;And here I thought you said you didn&#39;t like children.&quot;

&quot;SOME.&quot; Fujin said quietly; lost in thought. &quot;HERE...&quot; She finally said, 
offering the child back to Selphie.

&quot;And look, she didn&#39;t even cry.&quot; Selphie grinned.

&quot;Dinner&#39;s ready.&quot; Irvine chirped.

&quot;You guys staying for dinner?&quot; Selphie asked.

&quot;Oh, no we couldn&#39;t. It&#39;s the first supper you guys have as a family.&quot;

&quot;Now what&#39;s that supposed to mean.&quot; Irvine frowned.

&quot;Yeah Quisty, you&#39;re family.&quot; Selphie explained firmly.

&quot;I well...&quot; Quistis mumbled, looking to Fujin questioningly.

&quot;YOUR CHOICE.&quot;

&quot;Um, sure.&quot; Quistis grinned.

After a moment of rearranging to allow for Quistis&#39; wheelchair at the 
dinning table everyone sat down, while Selphie laid Edea in her crib.

&quot;Well ladies here you go, care of an old recipe I dug up in the 
library.&quot;

Irvine said proudly, as he passed out plates, heaped with fried okra, 
sprouts and a steak that looked too large for consumption along with a 
huge pile of mashed potatoes.

Fujin, who was somewhat of a dainty eater, gawked at the site of the 
meal.

Quistis too, boggled at the more than generous helpings.

&quot;You gals sure you don&#39;t want any chili?&quot; Irvine asked once more as he 
fixed himself a large bowel.

&quot;GAS.&quot; Fujin said firlmy, declining.

&quot;Fujin.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;Aw hell girl, that&#146;s part of the fun Irvine laughed.

&quot;You&#39;re disgusting.&quot; Selphie sighed, sitting down.

&quot;Bah, you are all a bunch of prudes; you need learn how to eat. You 
don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing.&quot; Irvine frowned, shaking his head.

&quot;GASTRONOMICAL NIGHTMARE.&quot; Fujin coughed, looking at the food warily.

&quot;Stop that.&quot; Quistis said wearily.

&quot;WHOLE COW?&quot;

&quot;Quit it.&quot;

&quot;SEE HORN.&quot; Fujin mumbled, poking at the steak as if half expecting it 
to crawl away.

&quot;You do not, stop it.&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;Well, eat up, it&#39;s not going anywhere.&quot; Irvine laughed.

Quistis shrugged and dug in while Fujin took a little more prodding.

&quot;This pretty good.&quot; Quistis finally admitted approvingly.

&quot;I&#39;ve been practicing.&quot; Irvine smiled proudly.

&quot;Yeah, poor me.&quot; Selphie sighed then looked to Quistis curiously. &quot;So 
now.&quot;

&quot;Pardon?&quot; Quistis blinked.

&quot;You two have the rings, when&#39;s the wedding.&quot; The small woman said with 
a wry grin.

&quot;Oh gracious.&quot; Quistis groaned.

&quot;Didn&#39;t think we noticed eh?&quot; Irvine laughed.

Fujin shifted in her chair uncomfortably.

&quot;Well, um, yeah, the rings.&quot; Quistis blushed slightly looking at her 
hand thoughtfully.

&quot;Hey! You didn&#39;t already do it did you!&quot; Selphie blurted in a near 
panic.

&quot;Um...not like you think.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Irvine frowned in confusion.

&quot;We didn&#39;t have wedding.&quot;

&quot;Oh so you&#39;re engaged&quot; Selphie beamed.

&quot;No, we&#39;re not having a ceremony.&quot; Quistis explained.

&quot;What? Why the hell not?&quot; Irvine blurted, baffled.

&quot;UNNECESSARY.&quot; Fujin said bluntly.

&quot;Well that&#146;s horse crap.&quot; Irvine gawked.

&quot;Hon, you&#39;re cowboy is showing.&quot; Selphie sighed, patting his hand before 
glaring back at Quistis.

&quot;You have to have a ceremony.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve been over this with the others.&quot; Quistis said firmly.

&quot;Well obviously you needed me there to knock sense into you two.&quot; 
Selphie squawked.

&quot;Selphie...&quot; Quistis started.

&quot;Don&#39;t Selphie me! There&#39;s no way in hell I&#39;m going to let you two go 
and sneak by and have some fruity little thing together and not involve 
us!&quot;

&quot;Whoa...kinky.&quot; Irvine smiled hugely.

&quot;Ugh...you...that&#146;s not what I meant!&quot; Selphie sneered at him, while 
Fujin was tempted to throw the hulking remnants of her steak.

&quot;I mean, you bet you two ran off and got hitched in secret or something. 
How rude, and you didn&#39;t even invite us!&quot; Selphie cried in dismay.

&quot;Selphie calm down, you&#39;re going to wake the baby.&quot; Quistis said, trying 
to shush her. &quot;What I meant was that we didn&#39;t have ceremony at all.&quot;

&quot;But, but... that don&#39;t make no sense...&quot; Irvine mouthed.

&quot;Doesn&#39;t make any sense.&quot; Quistis corrected him, reflexively.

Fujin buried her head in her hands, sensing this wasn&#39;t going to stop 
anytime soon.

&quot;Selphie, to honest here, no offense, but it&#39;s not any of your business. 
We decided that we didn&#39;t need some ceremony, we both know how we feel, 
that&#146;s enough.&quot; Quistis explained, blushing slightly.

&quot;Oh that&#146;s, sweet.&quot; Selphie said then abruptly scowled at Fujin causing 
her to jump. &quot;You did this!&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin blurted, having hoped to stay out of the conversation.

&quot;We both decided.&quot; Quistis interjected.

&quot;Um, your foods getting cold.&quot; Irvine noted quietly.

&quot;You&#39;ve gone crazy, I knew it, I knew!&quot; Selphie wailed pitifully. &quot;She&#39;s 
turned you away from us, you don&#39;t love us anymore!&quot; She continued, 
bursting into tears, which finally woke Edea who, started wailing as 
well.

Quistis sat dumbfound while Fujin watched, mouth agape as Selphie fell 
into a fit of bawling that was unparalleled. Irvine however, continued 
eating.

&quot;Um...&quot; Quistis mumbled, as Selphie quieted down slightly. &quot;I didn&#39;t 
know you felt so strongly...&quot; She tried feebly as Selphie exploded anew. 
With a sigh, Irvine moved to comfort Edea. Lifting her up, he had hoped 
to quiet her down, but to no avail.

&quot;Uh...&quot; Quistis stammered, looking to Fujin who bore a genuine look of 
concern. Both women shrugged at each other then turned to face Selphie.

&quot;Um, well I didn&#39;t think you guys felt so strongly, I guess... we can 
have a get together, something to celebrate...?&quot; Quistis offered glumly. 
&quot;Something small... I don&#39;t want a fuss. Fujin, what do you think?&quot;

Fujin shrugged in bewilderment, anything to stop the incessant wailing.

&quot;You promise...?&quot; Selphie choked between miserable sobs.

&quot;Yes...&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;Good.&quot; The pint-sized terror beamed instantly then resumed eating as if 
nothing had happened. Edea too, ceased her wailing and then yawned anew 
before falling back asleep, leaving Fujin and Quistis in a stupor and 
Irvine sighing in relief.
