Celest was soaked to the bone, and she wasn&#39;t happy. He&#39;d sent a message 
telling her to meet him at Balamb&#39;s front gates.

&quot;Seifer...&quot; She sighed, her mind lost amid unsure emotions and growing 
confusion. A flash of lightning, followed by a loud, violent 
thunderclap. The sound was invasive, terrifying causing her to crouch 
slightly in fright.

&quot;Ah what the hell is she doing.&quot; Zell frowned, watching her from an 
enclosed lounge overlooking the courtyard. Nicole walked to his side, 
wringing her hair and wearing a look of concern on her face.

&quot;She&#39;s not budging.&quot; She said in exasperation.

&quot;Figures.&quot; Zell grumbled. &quot;That&#146;s it then, she&#39;s gone nuts. I mean come 
on, she hardly knows him.&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t know that.&quot;

&quot;Whatever, look, she can do what she wants I&#39;m not going to sit out here 
all night and watch her get stood up by the guy, it&#39;s getting late.&quot;

&quot;We should do something, look at her.&quot; Nicole said worriedly.

&quot;She&#39;s a grown girl, she&#39;ll come in eventually.&quot;

&quot;No she won&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;Nikki, please.&quot; Zell chuckled as if she were foolish. &quot;She&#39;s not going 
to sit out there all night, she&#39;s many things, but she&#39;s not a fool.&quot;

Nicole stiffened slightly and folded her arms.

&quot;Aw hell, your right... lets go get her.&quot; He groaned in defeat.

Celest heard their approach but didn&#39;t turn to face them.

&quot;Go away.&quot; She grumbled.

&quot;Aw Celest, come inside, you&#39;ll catch your death.&quot; Zell winced, through 
the stinging rain.

&quot;He told me to meet him here.&quot; She countered bitingly.

Nicole went to her side and took her hand gently.

&quot;It&#39;s been three hours hon...&quot; She offered quietly. &quot;No one&#39;s seen him 
since this morning.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;ll be here...&quot; Celest mumbled, her normally vibrant red hair, 
hanging limply along her face and shoulders.

&quot;Damn it Celest, he stood you up. You got to face facts, it&#39;s not going 
to work, he&#39;s not coming, hell he&#39;s probably left altogether.&quot; Zell 
shouted, over the strengthening storm. Biting her lip, Celest turned to 
look at the inky blackness over the horizon.

&quot;He wouldn&#39;t do that...&quot; She said quietly. &quot;Would he?&quot;

&quot;Yes!?&quot; Zell cried out as if it were common knowledge.

&quot;You&#39;re not helping.&quot; Nicole scolded him before turning her attention 
back to the distraught girl at her side.

&quot;Come on baby.&quot; She said soothingly. &quot;We&#39;ll get you inside, dry you off 
and get some cocoa. Doesn&#39;t that sound nice?&quot;

With a shuttering sigh, and looking very lost, Celest relented, letting 
them lead her inside.

******************************

Morning, the storm had past. The sky was clear and the air was fresh 
with the scent of rain and freshly bloomed flowers. Quistis awoke first, 
lazily opening her eyes. Fujin stirred against her, her cute snoring 
barely audible. Quistis raised her hand and stared quietly at the ring 
adorning her finger. It glittered serenely in the rays of the morning 
sun and Quistis couldn&#39;t help but gasp slightly as everything sunk in. 
It wasn&#39;t so much the ring that impressed her, but the fact Fujin had 
made such a gesture. Sure, she knew Fujin loved her, loved her deeply 
but never did she imagine that she&#39;d have the courage to open herself up 
so.

&quot;What you must have endured...&quot; Quistis thought quietly, looking warmly 
at the young woman curled against her. Glancing down, Quistis noted 
Fujin&#39;s ring; a polar twin of her own, where there was silver on one, 
there was gold on the other and vice-versa.

A gentle knock on the door sounded before Kadowaki peeked in. Satisfied 
that everyone was decent she entered the room, being careful not to wake 
Fujin.

&quot;Morning.&quot; Quistis whispered.

&quot;You really shouldn&#39;t be sharing that bed. What would people think? This 
is clinic, not a bedroom&quot; Kadowaki scolded her, only half serious.

Beaming and choosing to ignore the comment, Quistis waved her bejeweled 
hand in Kadowaki&#39;s general direction.

&quot;What&#39;s this then?&quot; Kadowaki mumbled, adjusting her glasses as she took 
a better look. &quot;Oh my.&quot; She gasped, then put a hand to her mouth as 
Fujin grumbled from the outburst.

&quot;Whose idea?&quot; She asked in a near stupor. Quistis wrinkled her nose 
cutely and pointed down at Fujin who rolled over with a snort.

&quot;I&#39;ll be.&quot; Kadowaki chuckled, offering Quistis her daily dose of pills 
and vitamins.

&quot;Gross...&quot; Quistis frowned as she swallowed the foul mixture. Kadowaki 
offered a cup of water, which was greedily accepted.

&quot;She must be tired; usually she&#39;s up before dawn.&quot; Kadowaki noted idly 
as she scribbled in a memo pad.

&quot;I suppose.&quot; Quistis smiled, running a hand through Fujin&#39;s hair.

&quot;I guess it&#39;s probably from carting you all over Balamb yesterday.&quot; The 
doctor shrugged, cutting her a knowing look. Quistis cringed and moaned.

&quot;How?&quot; She started to ask but was interrupted.

&quot;Actually I didn&#39;t&quot; Kadowaki smiled slyly. &quot;But I did suspect something 
was up when I saw your little, Do not disturb sign, so early in the 
morning.&quot;

&quot;OH!&quot; Quistis blurted, shocked by Kadowaki&#39;s sneakiness.

&quot;Yup, busted.&quot; Kadowaki frowned sternly before poking Fujin gruffly atop 
the head.

&quot;DESIST.&quot; Fujin barked, still half asleep.

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; Kadowaki said, looking slighted. &quot;I do believe you have 
work to do today young lady.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis wondered aloud.

&quot;Oh she didn&#39;t tell you.&quot; Kadowaki grinned. Fuji here apparently had a 
party after-hours and I come in the next morning to find Celest sleeping 
off a hangover.&quot;

&quot;NOT LIKE THAT.&quot; Fujin blurted, sitting up abruptly, still not facing 
them.

&quot;Good morning.&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;Anyway.&quot; Kadowaki continued. &quot;She&#39;s now my personal assistant.&quot;

&quot;Like a nurse?&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;SLAVE.&quot; Fujin grumbled, hopping out of bed.

&quot;Quit being facetious.&quot; Kadowaki grinned. &quot;Get dressed, I need you to 
fly to Deling to pick up some supplies.&quot;

&quot;DINCHT?&quot;

&quot;He can go too, there&#39;s a lot of stuff.&quot;

&quot;NOT WHAT MEANT.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; Kadowaki smiled, handing her the list.

Quistis watched the exchange with growing amusement as Fujin grouchily 
retrieved fresh clothes from the gunnysack she&#39;d been using to store her 
things.

&quot;Nice ring by the way.&quot; Kadowaki offered as she continued Quistis&#39; exam.

&quot;Thanks, Fujin gave it to me.&quot; Quistis beamed proudly.

Fujin didn&#39;t respond but instead, went into the bathroom to freshen up.

&quot;She seems to be in a good mood.&quot; Kadowaki noted cheerfully. Quistis 
nodded in eager agreement.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen her so happy.&quot;

************************************

&quot;What the hell is that!?&quot; Zell blurted, nearly jumping out of the bed. 
Nicole sat up as well, looking about in a half-awake stupor. Once again, 
a loud knocking rattled the front door.

&quot;What time is it?&quot; Nicole groaned.

&quot;Six Thirty?&quot; Zell gawked, staggering out of the bed.

&quot;Tell them to go away.&quot; Nicole grumbled, burying her head under a 
pillow.

&quot;I&#39;ll do more than that...&quot; Zell cursed, stalking into the living room. 
Celest, sitting up groggily on the couch looked at him dully.

&quot;Wasn&#39;t me...&quot; She yawned, looking around. &quot;What am I doing here?&quot;

&quot;You fell asleep during the movie so we just let you crash.&quot; Zell 
explained as he yanked open the front door.

&quot;DINCHT.&quot; Fujin announced, standing before him in a militaristic stance 
with her hands behind her back.

&quot;Oh hell...&quot; Zell groaned, positive he wasn&#39;t going to like where this 
was going. He moved to shut the door in her face and she only squeezed 
in and looked around curiously. Celest waved awkwardly and Fujin merely 
nodded in greeting.

&quot;Go away you maniac, I&#39;m still mad at you.&quot; Zell groused.

&quot;APOLOGY.&quot; Fujin said simply

&quot;I don&#39;t want to hear it, whatever it...&quot; He started in a tiff then 
paused. &quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;I APOLOGIZE.&quot; Fujin elaborated.

&quot;You&#39;re mocking me.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Yes you are, you never apologize.&quot;

&quot;HERE.&quot; Fujin replied, shoving a small paper sack at him. Zell flinched 
as if waiting for it to explode or something.

&quot;Huh, what&#39;s this?&quot; He asked, suspicious.

&quot;BREAKFAST.&quot; Fujin explained.

&quot;Breakfast?&quot; Zell mouthed, looking in the bag. &quot;Oh hey, hotdogs...&quot; He 
mumbled in disbelief. &quot;Cool.&quot; His anger forgotten, he sat down to eat, 
oblivious to all.

&quot;NEED ASSISTANCE.&quot; Fujin said coolly, sitting down next to Celest who 
was looked roughed, even for someone just waking up.

&quot;Assistance, with what? Oh, glad to see you&#39;re up and about by the way.&quot; 
Zell noted, between bites.

&quot;I AM WELL.&quot; She assured him.

&quot;Ah, cool, what about Miss Trepe? She okay, think I can see her today, 
man I miss her.&quot;

&quot;WELL ALSO.&quot;

&quot;Awesome!&quot; He responded with a hoot then put and hand over his mouth. 
&quot;Aw hell, shh Nikki&#39;s still asleep.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re the one hollering.&quot; Celest sighed, rubbing her face gruffly. 
With a yawn, she then turned her attention to Fujin then gawked.

&quot;Oh wow!&quot; She blurted, grabbing Fujin&#39;s hand, almost provoking an 
attack.

&quot;RELEASE.&quot; Fujin snapped.

&quot;Where&#39;d you get that ring, it&#39;s beautiful!&quot; She fawned, then looked up 
apologetically. &quot;Sorry, I&#39;ve never seen you wear jewelry before.&quot; She 
giggled, letting her go.

&quot;Looks like a wedding ring.&quot; Zell mused absently to himself then choked. 
&quot;HEY!&quot; He started but was cut off as Nicole took that opportunity to 
stagger out of the bedroom like a enrage cave bear. Her eyes, bloodshot 
and red, she glowered angrily at the trio sitting in the living room.

&quot;Would you guys shut up! I&#39;m only in here, trying to get some damned 
sleep!&quot; She screeched in a tantrum.

&quot;Whoa...&quot; Zell gawked at her.

&quot;Eep...&quot; Celest squeaked, then grabbed Fujin&#39;s hand anew. &quot;Hey look at 
this!&quot; She beamed, trying to distract the ranting woman.

&quot;HEY!&quot; Fujin snapped.

Nicole blinked, only slightly dissuaded. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; She asked 
warily.

&quot;Wedding ring!&quot; Zell chirped then stuffed a hotdog in his mouth.

&quot;Wedding ring!?&quot; Celest balked at the implications.

Fujin had had enough.

&quot;DESIST.&quot; She said evenly, yanking her hand away from peering eyes.

&quot;Oh no ya don&#39;t!&quot; Zell laughed wildly. Rushing over he hopped the couch 
and landed with a thud throwing an arm around her shoulder.

&quot;SMELL!&quot; Fujin sputtered, scooting away from him.

&quot;Spill the beans!&quot; He laughed.

&quot;Oh this is interesting.&quot; Nicole said eagerly, cramming herself between 
Fujin and Celest.

&quot;NOSY!&quot; Fujin announced indignantly.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t give me that.&quot; Nicole laughed. &quot;You come in here wearing that 
and you really thought no one would notice or say anything?&quot;

&quot;So, let me get this straight...&quot; Celest asked slowly, as if confused. 
&quot;I assume Quistis gave you that.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin sighed.

&quot;ACK!?&quot; Nicole choked.

&quot;Whoa!&quot; Zell said in agreement.

&quot;Seifer...?&quot; Celest asked quietly, feeling her stomach knot up. Fujin 
turned green at the thought.

&quot;NO, I BOUGHT!&quot; She blurted quickly, not wanting to hear anymore 
half-baked guesses.

&quot;Oh, okay.&quot; Celest sighed with a smile.

&quot;Um...? Does Quistis have one too?&quot; Nicole asked gingerly, just making 
sure everyone was on the same note.

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot; Fujin groaned, rising to her feet. &quot;DINCHT, DEPARTING.&quot;

&quot;Oh, hell no, we ain&#39;t departing no where lady until you give some 
answers.&quot; He laughed raucously. &quot;You did it!&quot; He grinned stupidly. &quot;You 
proposed!&quot;

&quot;Proposed.&quot; Celest mumbled, looking a bit taken aback.

&quot;NOT DOING THIS.&quot; Fujin growled, not enjoying the poking and prodding.

&quot;You sly dog!&quot; Zell crowed.

&quot;UGH.&quot;

&quot;What ugh!? You should be happy.&quot; He laughed brightly. &quot;This rocks.&quot;

&quot;NOT WHAT THINK.&quot; Fujin sighed.

&quot;Huh, it&#39;s not?&quot; Nicole asked, getting confused as well.

&quot;What? So, you&#39;re not getting married?&quot; Zell blinked.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin groaned.

&quot;But I thought!?&quot; Nicole frowned.

&quot;NOT WHAT THINK.&quot;

&quot;Apparently.&quot; Celest grinned.

&quot;So what are you guys doing then, I mean, party or something? What?&quot;

&quot;WAS PRIVATE.&quot;

&quot;Private?&quot; Celest mumbled thoughtfully then nodded in understanding. 
&quot;Aw...&quot; She cooed. &quot;I get it, that&#146;s sweet.&quot;

&quot;So, you give her a ring but have no wedding!?&quot; Zell balked. &quot;That&#146;s 
whacked.&quot;

&quot;UNNECESSARY.&quot; Fujin glowered, getting upset.

&quot;What!?&quot; Zell gawked.

&quot;USELESS CONCEPT.&quot;

Zell stammered. &quot;Useless, hey, my folks were married!&quot;

&quot;PROVE ANYTHING?&quot;

&quot;Hell yes!&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot;

&quot;That they loved each other, you know!&quot;

&quot;THEY DIDN&#39;T BEFORE?&quot;

&quot;Yes! Huh...Wait... of course they did!?&quot; He puttered.

Fujin just looked at him blandly.

&quot;But there&#39;d be cake...&quot; He said in pitiful defeat.

&quot;Ignore him.&quot; Nicole injected, pushing him away.

&quot;What he means to say is, that it&#39;s a tradition.&quot;

&quot;NOT TRADITIONAL.&quot;

&quot;Got that right.&quot; Celest mumbled with a smirk.

&quot;How can you two just exchange rings and leave it at that?&quot; Nicole 
continued in earnest.

&quot;SIMPLE.&quot;

Nicole&#39;s eyes bulged in disbelief.

&quot;You&#39;ve got to do something, I mean, a party, a cook out, something, 
what will everyone think!?&quot;

&quot;DOESN&#39;T MATTER.&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t matter!?&quot; Nicole gasped, truly at a lost.

&quot;IS PRIVATE.&quot; Fujin reiterated again.

&quot;Makes sense to me.&quot; Celest offered.

Nicole let out a sound of exasperation.

&quot;Nuts.&quot; Zell mumbled.

&quot;TAKING RAGNAROK.&quot; Fujin said, rising to her feet to leave.

&quot;You&#39;re what!?&quot; Zell said, surprised.

&quot;COMING OR NOT?&quot;

&quot;Huh, were to?&quot;

&quot;DELING.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;KADOWAKI.&quot;

&quot;But I wanted to see Quistis.&quot; He whined.

&quot;LATER.&quot;

&quot;Ah hell.&quot;

&quot;YES OR NO.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah, let me clean up first.&quot; He groaned, trudging off into the 
bedroom.

&quot;And you sit back down; we&#39;re not done yet, not by a long shot.&quot; Nicole 
said sternly, a determined look in her eyes.

&quot;This is fun and all ladies, but I have to go, I have disciplinary duty 
this morning.&quot; Celest commented while stretching lazily. Walking to the 
door she paused to regard Nicole. &quot;About last night...&quot; She said 
awkwardly. &quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;Always a pleasure hon.&quot; Nicole beamed, waving at her. &quot;We&#39;re always 
here if you need us.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll remember that. See you around.&quot; Celest smiled as she exited.

Fujin sat back, ready to ignore anything else Nicole had to suggest.

*****************************

Celest arrived at the Disciplinary Hall later than she meant to. Nei, 
one of Quistis&#39; recent graduates looked at her in disappointment.

&quot;You&#39;re late.&quot;

&quot;I know, I know, I overslept.&quot;

&quot;Jacque will have a fit when he finds out.&quot;

&quot;Let him, I&#39;m ready for him, who do we have in holding?&quot; Celest asked 
gruffly, replacing Nei behind the front desk.

&quot;Ah, three jokers got in a bar fight up in the Blue Underground. We&#39;re 
holding em to sober em up, they should be up soon. If you want to 
process em out or let em sweat awhile.&quot; The slender, dark hared woman 
responded with a shrug.

&quot;I knew putting a bar in here was a bad idea. Some of the adults are 
worse than the students.&quot; Celest nodded expectantly.

&quot;I know, the place hasn&#39;t been opened four days, and we&#39;ve already had 
four fights and six P.I.&#39;s &quot;

&quot;Ah well, what can you do.&quot;

&quot;Not my problem, my shifts over. Do try not to get to bored.&quot; Nei 
winked, waving farewell.

Celest nodded courteously then settled back in the chair with a sigh. 
Rubbing her temples she tried in vain to concentrate on the pile of 
paperwork Nei had so conveniently left for her.

Popping her knuckles, she finally set of to work, thankful for the 
distraction.

Midway through the stack and about thirty minutes later an unexpected 
guest entered the office looking slightly annoyed.

&quot;Excuse...&quot; Jaya said awkwardly, not sure if that was the proper word.

&quot;Jaya?&quot; Celest blinked curiously. &quot;What are you doing down here?&quot;

&quot;I receive message.&quot; Jaya frowned, looking around nervously. &quot;Is prison 
yes?&quot;

&quot;Prison?&quot; Celest laughed, standing up. &quot;No, not a prison, more like a 
brig. No one showed you this place on your little tour?&quot;

&quot;Um no...they did not.&quot;

&quot;I see...&quot; Celest nodded then waited for some kind of explanation. Jaya 
just looked confused a moment the jumped as if remembering something.

&quot;My brother, Miguel and Raijin, they did not return yesterday.&quot;

&quot;Oh no, they&#39;ve gone missing you mean?&quot;

&quot;No, they are here, in this place.&quot; Jaya explained sheepishly.

&quot;They were arrested!?&quot; Celest stammered in surprise.

&quot;Yes...&quot;

&quot;Oh, okay, yeah that must be who&#39;s in the hold. Follow me.&quot;

Jaya did as she was told and followed Celest into the holding area. Sure 
as Nei had said, three figures snored loudly on their respective cots.

&quot;Wake up you lushes!&quot; Celest shouted.

Raijin was the first one up and groaned in protest, followed by Miguel, 
then Seifer.

&quot;Ah hell, where am I?&quot; Seifer groaned.

&quot;You!&quot; Celest blurted, her face twisting into a snarl.

&quot;Oh crap, ya know!&quot; Raijin blurted, seeing Jaya&#39;s piercing green eyes 
glaring at him.

&quot;Ah sister, you look lovely this morning.&quot; Miguel started smoothly. &quot;We 
um, had a misunderstanding with some of the locals.&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; Celest stammered. &quot;All of you!&quot;

&quot;Did I miss something?&quot; Raijin mumbled.

&quot;Let them out so I may beat them.&quot; Jaya frowned.

&quot;Don&#39;t temp me.&quot; Celest scowled.

&quot;Celest, um, hi, uh, I can explain.&quot; Seifer offered with a half smile.

&quot;Three hours!&quot; Celest blurted in out rage.

Seifer winced.

&quot;Three hours I waited for you. In the rain, looking like an idiot. Damn 
it, Zell and Nicole had to drag me inside.&quot;

&quot;Yo, Celest, it&#39;s not his fault ya know.&quot; Raijin interjected timidly.

&quot;You stay out of this!&quot; Celest snapped.

&quot;Raijin is correct, Seifer, he was nervous so we tried to help him 
relax.&quot; Miguel explained smoothly.

&quot;Then we heard some assholes talking crap about Fujin and Miss Trepe, 
and well...ya know.&quot; Raijin added sheepishly.

&quot;Fujin and Quistis?&quot; Celest groaned. &quot;I hate to break it to you clowns, 
but, not everyone is so rosy with that particular set up. I mean come on 
now, people are entitled to their opinions.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Raijin mumbled.

&quot;No buts, you guys can&#39;t go around pounding on people just because they 
said something mean. That&#146;s just juvenile. Guess, what I&#39;m not terribly 
keen on the idea myself, you going to come hit me now?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not like.&quot; Seifer sighed. &quot;You weren&#39;t there.&quot;

&quot;Oh ho!&quot; Celest crowed. &quot;Speaking of not there!&quot; She glared, moving 
closer to Seifer while Raijin and Miguel moved noticeably away.

&quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry; I&#39;ll make it up to you.&quot; Seifer groaned.

&quot;Ha!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be like that. Come on, cut me some slack.&quot; He sighed.

&quot;Why should I?&quot; She pouted, savoring the fact that she had the upper 
hand for once.

Leaning close against the bars, Seifer looked at her with beseeching 
eyes.

&quot;Dinner, dancing, a night to remember.&quot; He said with a smoldering smile 
and glint of promise that made her knees buckle.

Miguel and Raijin exchanged knowing and downright wolfish grins that 
quickly faded as they caught Jaya&#39;s enflamed glare. Celest, stepped away 
from the cell somewhat flushed.

&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll hold you to that dinner.&quot; She said after a moment of 
deliberation.

Seifer smiled cockily and looked eagerly at the cell door.

&quot;In fact, just to make sure you don&#39;t wander off again, you&#39;ll be 
spending the day here.&quot; She said with a downright sinister smile.

&quot;What!?&quot; Seifer stammered; his features slacking.

&quot;Um, what about us?&quot; Raijin said with puppy dog eyes.

&quot;You guys can go, he stays.&quot;

&quot;Celest, that is not fair.&quot; Jaya frowned, moving to her side to regard 
Seifer thoughtfully.

&quot;Yeah, Celest, listen to her.&quot; Seifer all but pleaded, having no desire 
to die of boredom in the cramped cell.

&quot;Leave them all in there.&quot; Jaya added, then walked away with a flourish.

&quot;Bye guys.&quot; Celest giggled waving at them daintily.

&quot;Aw what the hell!&quot; Raijin shouted in dismay. &quot;Jaya, come on baby you 
can&#39;t leave us in here. That ain&#39;t right.&quot;

&quot;Celest, come on, jokes over, I said I was sorry!&quot; Seifer called after 
her but to no avail. To his credit, Miguel accepted his fate with a 
modicum of dignity and sat back down without so much as a huff.

Jaya giggled to Celest as they made their way back out front. Once 
there, Celest exploded into a fit of joyous laughter and bounced around 
the room.

&quot;He cares, he cares, he cares!&quot; She teetered brightly, beckoning Jaya to 
join her merriment.

********************

Xu screamed with joy as she rushed into the room. Quistis only had a 
moment to look up from her book before being engulfed in a tight 
embrace.

&quot;You&#39;re back!&quot; Xu giggled brightly.

&quot;Not for long, you&#39;re choking me...&quot; Quistis hacked.

&quot;Oh, oh! Sorry!&quot; Xu cried out in dismay. Letting her she promptly 
checked her over motherly. &quot;I didn&#39;t hurt you did I!?&quot; She jabbered in a 
near panic.

&quot;Xu, Xu, I&#39;m okay...&quot; Quistis said with a tickled giggle.

&quot;Oh...eh...sorry.&quot; Xu blushed then sighed happily. &quot;You&#146;re back to 
normal, thank goodness, how are you feeling, are you well, how&#39;s Fujin, 
when will you be back on you&#39;re feet?!&quot; Xu prattled, nearly incoherent.

&quot;Take a breath, you&#39;re going to hyperventilate.&quot; Quistis giggled.

Pausing, Xu took a deep breath.

&quot;Okay, I&#39;m fine.&quot; She said slowly.

&quot;Good.&quot; Quistis smiled.

Sitting down on the side of the bed, Xu took her hand companionably then 
paused.

&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; She paused, noting the ring on Quistis hand.

&quot;Fujin gave it to me.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s lovely, when did she do that?&quot;

&quot;Last night.&quot;

&quot;Does this mean there&#39;s wedding bells in the air?&quot; Xu giggled. Quistis 
smiled warmly and shook her head.

&quot;No, we&#39;ll be fine; besides, I don&#39;t think either of us wants a fuss.&quot;

&quot;I understand. That&#146;s so sweet; I bet the poor thing was a nervous 
wreck.&quot;

&quot;Actually, she handled it better than I would&#39;ve expected.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s changed a lot while you&#39;ve been away.&quot;

&quot;I know, but at least she&#39;s happy.&quot;

&quot;Yes, she is, truly, even I can tell that.&quot;

&quot;So.&quot; Quistis smiled, patting her hand. &quot;Tell me about this promotion.&quot;

**********************

&quot;You can wear a dress, or wait...&quot; Zell said thoughtfully as he sat 
lazily behind the Ragnarok&#39;s controls.

&quot;SILENCE.&quot; Fujin sighed.

&quot;No, I can&#39;t see you in a wedding dress. Ew, you&#39;re a little small for a 
Tux, though you do have the shoulders.&quot; He prattled, not even 
acknowledging her. Fujin held her head and sighed heavily.

&quot;DINCHT.&quot; She tried again.

&quot;Nah, that&#146;s to macho, something casual, ah hell I don&#39;t know. Lets talk 
about catering. Food, now that&#146;s something I know about. You gotta have 
a cooked ham, some mashed potatoes. Nah that&#146;s to normal, someone like 
Miss Trepe would want something fancy like fish egg things and those 
funky little mushrooms pigs eat.&quot;

&quot;ZELL!!&quot; Fujin finally shouted.

Zell looked over at her casually. &quot;You say something?&quot;

&quot;SHUT UP!&quot;

&quot;Hey, someone has to plan this thing.&quot;

&quot;NO THING.&quot; Fujin said pointedly.

&quot;Bah, you&#39;re just being difficult.&quot;

&quot;ABOUT TO BE VIOLENT.&quot;

&quot;Only you could be mad about your own wedding.&quot;

&quot;NO WEDDING.&quot;

&quot;You say that now.&quot;

&quot;STOP IT.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not doing anything; you&#39;re the one being difficult.&quot; Zell mumbled 
quietly. Fujin shrieked and clutched her head, he was driving her 
insane.

&quot;DROP NOW, DESIST!!&quot; She blurted.

&quot;Fine, fine, but I can tell you, once Selphie and Rinoa get back, I bet 
they&#39;re not going to drop it.&quot;

&quot;THEY WILL.&quot;

&quot;If you say so.&quot;

&quot;ZELL...&quot;

&quot;Fine, fine, you old grouch.&quot;

&quot;NOT OLD.&quot;

&quot;You act it.&quot;

&quot;JUST BE QUIET.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not the one throwing a fit.&quot;

Fujin tensed, then reclined her seat forcibly. With purpose, she 
retrieved the headphones she wisely brought with her and put them on.

&quot;Oh what? You&#39;re ignoring me now?&quot; Zell frowned as she switched on the 
player. &quot;That&#146;s mature.&quot; He mumbled sourly. &quot;Fine, see if I care...&quot;

***********

&quot;So you mean to tell me you guys just run around a kill stuff.&quot; Seifer 
said skeptically. &quot;Sounds kind of retarded to me.&quot;

&quot;No, no, it&#39;s not like that. It&#39;s more like knights of old ya know.&quot; 
Raijin explained. &quot;Going around ridding the countryside of dragons and 
such.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s the silliest thing I ever heard.&quot;

&quot;So says the man with the romantic dream.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s not funny.&quot; Seifer frowned darkly.

&quot;Eh, sorry.&quot; Raijin mumbled apologetically.

&quot;We help people.&quot; Miguel added. &quot;People too weak to help themselves. 
Find criminals, dispose of dangerous things.&quot;

&quot;We get to do some good, while seeing the world. That and the pays 
good.&quot; Raijin grinned.

&quot;Oh I get it.&quot; Seifer assured them. &quot;You&#39;re mercenaries, bounty hunters, 
not a bad idea actually. I considered it myself once.&quot;

&quot;What stopped you?&quot; Raijin asked curiously.

&quot;Long story...&quot;

&quot;Fair enough.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s funny, I actually envy you.&quot; Seifer chuckled. &quot;Imagine that.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...Imagine.&quot; Raijin said quietly then looked up. &quot;Come with us.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Seifer blinked in confusion.

&quot;Yeah, it&#39;d be like old times ya know.&quot;

&quot;I hope not...&quot; Seifer said darkly.

&quot;You know what I mean. Come on, you and I both know you&#39;re leaving 
anyway. Balamb&#39;s not your home anymore.&quot;

&quot;Raijin has a point.&quot; Miguel nodded sagely. &quot;You are talented; you would 
be a great benefit.&quot;

&quot;Ah hell guys I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not much of a team player.&quot;

&quot;What then, you going to wander the world alone, that sucks.&quot;

&quot;Look Ray, even if I went with you guys, what about Celest?&quot;

&quot;Ah, he does care for her.&quot; Miguel grinned. &quot;My sister was correct.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t start.&quot; Seifer growled.

&quot;Well...&quot; Raijin said, his brow wrinkling with thought. &quot;Bring her 
along, the more the merrier ya know.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re kidding right.&quot; Seifer laughed.

&quot;What is so funny?&quot; Miguel asked.

&quot;What the hell makes you think she&#39;d leave all this behind, a life like 
ours is rough and ugly. Look at you us, we&#39;ve seen more action than men 
twice our age and we&#39;ve the scars to prove it. Celest&#39;s a city girl; all 
rose petals and perfume, there&#39;d be no way.&quot;

&quot;How do you know if you do not ask?&quot; Miguel said quietly.

&quot;I just don&#39;t see it happening is all.&quot; Seifer shrugged.

&quot;Ask her man, she may surprise you ya know. Besides, we could use a 
gunner, Miguel&#39;s aim sucks.&quot;

&quot;Ah hell, I&#39;ll think about it. What could happen?&quot;
