Fujin&#39;s haggard features turned into a scowl and she tried to move 
around him. He moved and intercepted her grabbing her by the shoulders.

&quot;RELEASE!&quot; She snarled.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; He asked quietly.

&quot;RELEASE!&quot; She said again.

&quot;Xu told me what happened...&quot;

Fujin&#39;s expression looked downright murderous.

&quot;NOT HAVE ME...&quot; She said coldly. &quot;CHANGES NOTHING.&quot;

Seifer slapped her and she staggered back stunned, her crimson gaze 
glaring with a fire she hadn&#39;t had in a long time.

&quot;I&#39;m not here for that and I&#39;m insulted you&#39;d think so.&quot; He said in a 
low, wounded tone. Shaking his head he turned to leave but stopped and 
turned to regard her once more.

&quot;She wouldn&#39;t want this. She&#39;d expect more from you. You&#39;ve changed, for 
the better, don&#39;t destroy everything you two built. You&#39;ve got be 
stronger than this. Things will get better, you have to believe that.&quot;

&quot;ONE TO TALK.&quot; She responded bitterly. &quot;LOOK WHAT BECOME!&quot;

Seifer nodded and smiled sourly.

&quot;I know what I am, I&#39;ve faced my demons and accept them, so don&#39;t try to 
turn this around. You&#39;re hurting inside and it&#39;s tearing you apart.&quot; He 
sighed and walked towards her and put a comforting hand on her shoulder. 
She started to move it but didn&#39;t have the energy.

&quot;You can&#39;t go it alone anymore. You lost that strength when you went and 
fell in love. Its a different game now Fu.&quot; He grinned. &quot;Gotta play by 
its rules.&quot;

Fujin took a breath and brushed his hand off her shoulder as if it were 
a bug.

&quot;NO GAME.&quot; She said flatly.

&quot;So quit acting like you lost.&quot; He snarled, his grin fading instantly.

&quot;You can&#39;t change the past. Life goes on so deal with it!&quot; He spat 
angrily then left without another word and slamming the door behind him. 
Fujin stood quietly a moment and swallowed hard.

&quot;KNOW NOTHING!&quot; She screamed, grabbing a lamp to throw but stopped; more 
out of respect for Quistis&#39; belongings that an act of self-control.

****************

He was beginning to think Xu was right. He feared he might have done 
more harm than good in talking to her.

&quot;Damn it.&quot; He blurted in aggravation. He didn&#39;t mean for it to go so 
poorly. He&#39;d only wanted to offer condolences and help if possible.

&quot;I&#39;m a fucking idiot.&quot; He scolded himself.

&quot;No argument there.&quot; Xu said, surprising as he rounded the corner with a 
punch to the nose.

Seifer staggered back as white flashes of pain dazed him slightly.

&quot;Like that, do ya.&quot; She grinned wickedly, hopping back and forth eager 
for him to try something. &quot;Couldn&#39;t leave well enough alone could ya.&quot; 
She sneered.

&quot;Oh, that was low.&quot; Seifer cursed under his breath, holding his bloody 
nose.

&quot;Take him down.&quot; Xu said to the small squad of guards who stood in the 
hall with her. Seifer didn&#39;t struggled as they wrestled him to the 
ground and handcuffed him.

&quot;I suppose you wouldn&#39;t believe it if said I was just out for a walk.&quot; 
Seifer grunted as he was hauled to his feet and restrained.

&quot;Shut up.&quot; Xu scowled, looking at her swollen knuckles. The bastard had 
a head of stone. &quot;I&#39;ve half a mind to throw you into the ocean.&quot;

&quot;I already took a bath.&quot; Seifer grinned.

&quot;Don&#39;t make me beat you.&quot; Xu growled. Seifer growled back and bit at her 
playfully.

&quot;You sack of...&quot; Xu started then paused as Fujin rounded the corner with 
a ferocious look on her face.

&quot;BASTARD!&quot; She snarled and rushed forward.

Seifer smiled victoriously and she promptly slammed her knee into his 
stomach causing him to double over.

&quot;WHOA!&quot; Xu shouted in surprise as Fujin backed off momentarily, huffing 
in anger.

&quot;Seifer what did you say to her!&quot; Xu shouted, interjecting herself 
between the two of them.

&quot;What she needed to hear!&quot; He shouted, smirking at Fujin wickedly. 
&quot;That&#146;s the old fire I remember!&quot;

&quot;KILL YOU!&quot; Fujin exploded, bowling over Xu to leap at him sending all 
of them to the floor. He had only wanted to get a rise out of her, 
hoping to snap her back from the throes of depression. His plan worked, 
but now she was trying her damnedest to kill him. Fujin was screaming 
incoherently as she grabbed him by the hair and slammed his head into 
the floor with all her might repeatedly.

&quot;Hyne! Fujin stop it you&#39;re gonna kill him!&quot; Xu screamed, grabbing her 
and trying to pry her loose. Even with her weakened state, Fujin was 
still far stronger than Xu expected, even more so now that she was 
caught up in a rage. Whipping around, she raised her fist as if to 
strike but paused.

&quot;Fujin!&quot; Xu screamed, trying to snap her out of it.

Panicked and caught completely by surprise the guards were shouting for 
assistance over their radios while moving in to break up the fiasco. 
Fujin looked at Xu intensely then back down to Seifer. Cursing loudly, 
she jumped up and with a brutally effective move, heel stomped him in 
the chest. Seifer hacked hoarsely and felt something crack in his chest 
from the blow.

&quot;That&#146;s enough!&quot; Xu shouted, pulling Fujin away from him. Fujin yanked 
loose and glared at her, then turned her attentions to the guards who 
circled her, her gaze promising further violence if the moved closer.

Tears streamed down her face as she struggled to catch her breath, it 
had been a long time since she had to exert herself.

&quot;Looks like I hit a nerve...&quot; Seifer coughed, pulling himself up to his 
knees, his breath rattling in his chest. Fujin kicked him in the face 
and straddled his chest, threatening to cave his skull in.

&quot;Damn it!&quot; Xu shouted, moving forward to break it up, then paused; 
fearing Fujin may kill him if further provoked.

&quot;Feel better?&quot; Seifer coughed.

Fujin paused, her hair falling in sweaty tangles over her face as she 
glared at him in wild-eyed confusion.

&quot;You see.&quot; He said quietly. &quot;You&#39;re still alive.&quot;

&quot;WHY WON&#39;T YOU DIE?&quot; Fujin hissed, tears flowing down her cheek.

&quot;Someday, but not now.&quot; He coughed, blood staining his teeth. Fujin 
lowered her arms and slid off him and Xu breathed a sigh of relief. 
Sitting up slowly Fujin coughed and fell against the wall wearily.

&quot;Feel like shit don&#39;t you?&quot; Seifer said quietly as he struggled to his 
feet. &quot;Well, welcome to my nightmare.&quot; He sighed.

Fujin ignored him, and looked to Xu who shook her head quietly.

&quot;WHY?&quot; Fujin choked, still not looking at him.

&quot;You needed this. You needed to get it out, it was eating you alive.&quot; He 
chuckled, then staggered as a painful cough took him.

&quot;HORRIBLE.&quot;

&quot;Well, to be honest... I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d go this far...&quot; He groaned 
ruefully.

&quot;HATE YOU.&quot;

&quot;I know, I know. You&#39;re welcome.&quot; He said sarcastically.

Fujin could&#39;ve screamed until she died from it.

&quot;This is called hitting bottom. From here out, you have two choices, 
sink or swim. And all things considered.&quot; He wheezed. &quot;You and I both 
know, your going to swim, I mean, what would Quistis think?&quot;

&quot;LEAVE HER OUT OF THIS.&quot; Fujin snapped sharply, her voice cracking.

&quot;Leave her out?&quot; He said incredulously then exploded. &quot;She&#39;s the whole 
reason you&#39;re like this!&quot; He shouted. &quot;This... this sitting around 
feeling sorry for yourself isn&#39;t like you damn it! Leave that crap for 
people like Rinoa and Squall! You&#39;re better than that. You know it, I 
know it, and you damn well can bet Quistis knew it!&quot;

Fujin whimpered.

&quot;That&#39;s enough Seifer.&quot; Xu spat.

&quot;Oh boo hoo!&quot; Seifer snorted.

Without a word, Fujin took a slow, deep breath and stood up. Seifer 
paused and frowned as she faced him with a blank expression, devoid of 
emotion. Xu and Seifer exchanged glances, thinking he may have pushed 
her to far.

&quot;Fu...&quot; Xu said warningly, fearing what she may do. Fujin moved forward 
and Seifer flinched, waiting for her assault. Instead, she just pushed 
past him and further up the hall.

&quot;THINGS TO DO.&quot; She huffed, running a hand through her hair wearily.

&quot;Whoa, wait!&quot; Xu blurted moving to follow, pausing long enough to look 
at the bewildered young guards. &quot;Clean him up and put him in a cell.&quot; 
She sighed, pointing to Seifer before chasing after Fujin.

Fujin wiped her face and sniffed, having regained her composure. 
Brushing the hair back from her face she sighed and looked over to Xu 
who&#39;d matched her pace.

&quot;APOLOGIZE.&quot;

Xu smiled and put a hand on her shoulder.

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; She said quietly.

&quot;SEIFER CORRECT...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t listen to him, he&#39;s twisted.&quot; Xu mumbled in aggravation.

&quot;NEEDED THIS...&quot; Fujin interrupted.

&quot;Um, needed what?&quot;

&quot;RELEASE...&quot; Fujin answered cryptically. Xu looked thoughtfully a moment 
then grinned.

&quot;I can see how caving his head in would be therapeutic.&quot;

&quot;NOT FUNNY.&quot;

&quot;Um sorry...&quot;

&quot;SELF PITY... UNACCEPTABLE.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a little harder than that. I mean heartache is not something you 
can just switch off like a switch.&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Then what do you mean?&quot;

&quot;ACCEPTANCE... OF PAIN.&quot; Fujin answered, her voice quavering slightly.

&quot;You mean to live with it...?&quot;

Fujin nodded and Xu sighed in understanding.

&quot;You&#39;ve struggled with this for too long... It&#39;s good your trying to 
come to terms now. Please though. Just remember that we&#39;re here for you. 
I&#39;m here for you.&quot; She whispered quietly. Fujin nodded, her cool fa&ccedil;ade 
cracking. Without a word, she hugged the other woman quietly. Xu, 
startled by the unexpected gesture returned it somewhat awkwardly at 
first, then gradually relaxed.

&quot;It&#39;ll be okay.&quot; She whispered softly as Fujin sobbed quietly on her 
shoulder.

********************

By morning, the residents of Balamb Garden awoke in good spirits, if not 
a bit hung over from the late night parties spawned from the wedding. 
Much to everyone&#39;s delight, Cid saw fit to give everyone a few days off 
from class and work. Most planned to use the time to get settled back in 
after being forced to stay in Esthar for so many months while others 
spent it lounging with friends or just enjoying the peace and quiet of 
their own homes.

Seifer however wasn&#39;t any of them. He awoke with a start from a fairly 
rowdy dream. The cot on which he lay wasn&#39;t tolerable of someone of his 
size jerking around and promptly deposited him in the floor with thud.

&quot;Wakey, wakey sleepy head.&quot; Celest chirped from behind a small wooden 
desk facing the holding cells.

&quot;I don&#39;t suppose I could get breakfast in bed?&quot; Seifer grunted, hauling 
himself off the floor. Thankfully, Xu saw fit to heal him from Fujin&#39;s 
attack, however it did nothing to ease the stiff, aches and pains that 
lingered.

&quot;Not likely, stud.&quot; Celest smiled, watching him with a catty expression.

Seifer glanced at her warily, not sure what to make of her.

&quot;Surprising.&quot; He finally grinned.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Celest responded curiously.

&quot;You&#39;re not like the others.&quot; He said, climbing back on the cot.

&quot;Gee, I don&#39;t know how to take that. What do you mean?&quot; She asked, while 
idly working on a crossword puzzle.

&quot;You haven&#39;t cussed me out or attacked me yet.&quot; He chuckled.

&quot;I see.&quot; Celest blinked, setting her pencil down. &quot;Then what should I 
do? Spank you and call you names?&quot; She asked innocently.

Seifer laughed aloud and she went back to her crossword.

&quot;You&#39;re funny, I like that.&quot; He grinned.

&quot;You&#39;re not, and I don&#39;t&quot; She answered snappily.

&quot;Ouch! Now that wasn&#39;t cute.&quot; He said, feigning insult.

&quot;Poor baby.&quot; She chuckled and stood. &quot;Hold on I&#39;ll get your breakfast.&quot;

&quot;I like pancakes!&quot; He shouted, watching her rear as she left. &quot;Very, 
nice.&quot; He sighed, beginning not to mind being locked up. His smiled 
faded as Xu entered the room, a cup of coffee in hand and a scowl on her 
face.

&quot;Ew, bring the other one back!&quot; Seifer shouted in disappointment.

&quot;You&#39;re an asshole.&quot; Xu told him blandly, setting her coffee down and 
approaching his cell.

&quot;You want me.&quot; He smiled, puckering his lips at her.

Xu snorted and unlocked the cell then opened it.

&quot;You wish.&quot; She huffed, then thumbed towards the exit. &quot;Get out.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;You heard me, you&#39;re free to go.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s nice, considering I didn&#39;t do anything wrong to begin with.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re trying to make me hurt you aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Never.&quot;

&quot;You seem in awfully good spirits, considering you almost go yourself 
killed last night.&quot; Xu said sourly as he brushed past her, being sure to 
bump her along the way.

&quot;I love life, what can I say.&quot; He shrugged then turned to regard her 
seriously.

&quot;How&#39;s she doing?&quot; He asked, his jovial attitude vanishing instantly and 
Xu found herself wondering if it was ever there.

&quot;Fine actually.&quot; She answered nonchalantly. &quot;Matter of fact, she told me 
to let you out.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s true.&quot;

&quot;She loves me.&quot; He said jokingly.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so. But you did help her. In your own clumsy, idiotic, 
jackass kind of way.&quot;

&quot;Stop, you&#39;ll make me blush.&quot; He smiled broadly, his typical bravado 
returning instantly. Xu frowned and looked at him severely.

&quot;You are insane...&quot; She stated, her tone devoid of sarcasm and humor.

&quot;Is she here?&quot; He asked, ignoring her comment.

&quot;No, she went to talk to Doctor Kadowaki.&quot;

&quot;Oh...&quot; He frowned, serious once more. &quot;I&#39;ll leave her alone then. Care 
if I stick around until she comes back.&quot;

&quot;Would it stop you if I said no?&quot;

&quot;Honestly?&quot; He asked thoughtfully.

Fed up with his nonsense she pushed him out the door. &quot;Get out of my 
face.&quot; She shouted irritably. He stumbled, laughingly and paused as he 
nearly ran into Celest, who carried a tray of biscuits and juice.

&quot;Leaving us already?&quot; She asked mildly.

&quot;Gotta go.&quot; He whistled cheerfully, snatching up a biscuit and moving 
past her, but not before smacking her on the rear with the palm of his 
hand.

With a scream of shock Celest dropped the tray and spun around to face 
him but he was already gone, his laughter echoing up the hall.

**************

Fujin walked quietly up the hall. In her hand, she carried a large 
plastic bag filled with shampoo and similar household items. She also 
carried a duffel bag full of lord knows what. Dressed casually, in 
sandals, tee shirt and sweat pants, she padded up the hall with a look 
of indifference. During the long months after the encounter with Norg, 
she&#39;d let her hair grow out, more out of a lack of attention to it than 
fashion choice and now wore it in a small ponytail that danced about as 
she walked. She noted Nicole walking up the hall towards her with a 
small group of friends. Nicole glanced up and smiled sheepishly at her 
but said nothing, expecting her cold aloofness that was typical of late. 
Fujin surprised her. Stopping as the small group neared she composed 
herself and offered a small and decidedly unnerving smile.

&quot;GREETINGS.&quot; She said stiffly.

Nicole paused and looked at her somewhat nervously. The other girls in 
the group glanced about but said nothing before moving on without a 
word. Nicole waved goodbye then turned her attentions back to Fujin, who 
was looking more uncomfortable by the minute.

&quot;Um... Fujin...hi.&quot; Nicole said quietly, not sure how to react.

Fujin&#39;s gaze darted about as she tried to think of anything to say. Her 
awkward attempts at being social were crashing dismally. Biting her lip 
as she struggled a moment, she finally met Nicole&#39;s gaze once more.

&quot;APOLOGY.&quot; She blurted, feeling like some hunchback trying to fit in at 
a king&#39;s banquet.

&quot;Um...what did I do?&quot; Nicole said quietly, feeling nervous.

Fujin shook her head in frustration, her ponytail flailing around 
cutely; Nicole had to fight to keep from grinning.

&quot;NOT WHAT MEAN.&quot; Fujin tried again. &quot;Just leave!&quot; She screamed inwardly.

&quot;I APOLOGIZE.&quot; She said after a pause.

&quot;For what?&quot; Nicole asked, completely lost.

&quot;RUDE, UNPLEASANT...&quot; Fujin mumbled.

&quot;Huh, when?&quot;

&quot;LAST FEW MONTHS.&quot;

Nicole&#39;s eyes widened slightly in understanding and she nodded her head.

&quot;Oh, oh my, hon, you don&#39;t have to apologize.&quot; She smiled, laughing 
slightly in relief.

&quot;I DO.&quot; Fujin said adamantly.

&quot;No you don&#39;t but I&#39;ll accept it anyway.&quot; Nicole grinned, then looked 
her over. &quot;Long day ahead huh?&quot;

Fujin nodded solemnly and Nicole sighed.

&quot;You need a hand?&quot; She asked politely, Fujin shook her head no.

&quot;Well at least let me walk you down and help you with some of that.&quot; 
Nicole offered, taking the bag from her hands.

&quot;THANK YOU.&quot; Fujin smiled shyly.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; Nicole chirped brightly as the two headed up the 
hallway.

************************

The shades were still drawn as Fujin entered the small room, the smell 
of disinfectant hung in the air and she frowned in aggravation.

&quot;ANNOYING.&quot; She mumbled aloud as she fumbled around in the bag Nicole 
had carried. Pulling out a can of pine scented spray she sprayed the air 
for a brief moment and opened the blinds. The sky was a bright, lovely 
blue and clouds drifted by right outside, it was breathtaking and Fujin 
grinned at the sight.

&quot;LOVELY DAY.&quot; She said with a sigh before turning back to the duffel 
bag.

She had moved all her things from Esthar prior to the wedding but the 
place still needed a few touches to be considered comfortable.

Unzipping the bag, she removed a stack of mounted photos, the same ones 
that had sat atop Quistis&#39; fireplace. One by one, she set them around 
the room. The gentle hum and pulse of machinery in the background was 
soothing to her as she set about work. During the night, she had carried 
several boxes and other items to the room and it took the better part of 
the day to get them set up. Finally, her task complete she sat back and 
stretched.

&quot;DONE.&quot; She yawned, surveying everything to make sure it was perfect 
before heading to a small sink that sat against the wall. Washing her 
hands and face gingerly, she then dried off and turned to walked to 
where the small machines pumped and beeped dutifully. Checking them 
intently, she went to the bed they sat beside and knelt.

&quot;Love you.&quot; She whispered softly to Quistis, who lay deep in a coma...</pre>
