<h1>Everybody Else's Girl (part 3 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff8/index.html">Final Fantasy  8</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/pphelan.html">Patrick Phelan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff8/everygirl-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Xu&#39;s schedule for the three hours after the officially-determined SeeD 
lunch hour said &quot;free time&quot;. Being the young woman she was, free time 
meant working in the Training Centre to preserve her skills and have a 
decent &quot;kill list&quot; to show off to NORG when the time came to evaluate 
her Rank, even if most of them were Grats. Quantity was what NORG 
wanted, and if he saw the occasional T-Rexaur, so much the better.

It was only in these periods that her GF was awake, these days. She 
tried her best to keep her compatibility with Olympia strong, but most 
of the time Xu sorted paperwork and Olympia lounged in her hindbrain, 
half-asleep.

Now, though, Olympia was whispering tactics to her near-constantly, 
pointing out weak spots in Grat tentacles that Xu slammed with the heel 
of her hand, shouting the assigned names of paramagic spells in Xu&#39;s 
voice as Xu let them fly from her hands. Sometimes, Xu was shocked by 
the blend of calm and viciousness that the GF in her head exhibited. 
Most of the time, she found it wonderfully freeing - when she worked at 
payroll duty so long that Olympia told her, you could blow them all into 
a frenzy and out of the window with an Aero, or burn them to ash with a 
Fire, or render them inky and illegible with Water, she found herself 
wishing she could, and yearning for the release of the Training Centre.

There were always enough Grats there to keep her occupied, running in a 
flood into her Aeros, and then into her hands and feet. Perhaps they 
thought that a seemingly unarmed SeeD was an easy target, but even 
without the fighting gloves a great deal of SeeDs preferred, Xu was as 
deadly as a gunblader.

She threw a Tornado into three Grats charging at her and readied herself 
to the next, when Olympia shouted in her head; Behind you!

She turned, and saw two more Grats rushing at her, waving their 
tentacles and &#39;speaking&#39; gibberish - she slammed a chop into one, 
rendering a single tentacle useless, and kicked it in the side of what 
served it for a head. It went down, burbling, and when she turned to the 
other, she was surprised to see it already falling.

Then a very familiar whip point came back from the body into the hands 
of a very familiar SeeD.

&quot;Hello again, Xu,&quot; Quistis said, for all the world as if she&#39;d only been 
gone for an hour, rather than a half-year mission to a place in which 
SeeDs were never welcome.

&quot;Regulation 26E,&quot; Xu replied, for all the world as if seeing Quistis 
again wasn&#39;t the most wonderful thing that had happened to her in the 
year, &quot;states that SeeD training battles, whether in the Centre or 
otherwise, are not to be interfered with without the personal permission 
of the SeeD who initiated the battle, through attacking or being 
attacked, unless the SeeD is in mortal danger.&quot;

Quistis laughed at that one, and then stepped decorously forward through 
the Grat bodies. Xu expected a pat on the shoulder, perhaps a quick 
clasp of hands, but Quistis surprised her by wrapping her arms around 
her for a quick hug. &quot;I missed you,&quot; she said into Xu&#39;s ear.

Xu had to fight the urge to bring her arms around Quistis&#39; waist and 
hold her close as long as humanly possible. She squeezed the other girl 
close for a moment, and then stepped away. &quot;I should probably change my 
clothes,&quot; she said in half an explanation, gesturing at two tiny spots 
of Grat blood on the side of her jacket.

&quot;Should I meet you in the library?&quot; Quistis asked.

Xu shook her head. &quot;Don&#39;t bother, really! You can come back to my dorm. 
Quieter, and I really want to speak to you.&quot;

&quot;But didn&#39;t you say you had to change?&quot; Quistis the Ever-Demure, thought 
Xu. She was surprised that Quistis had done anything so indecorous as to 
hug her, but very pleasantly so.

&quot;As a Faculty Assistant, I&#39;m in the Instructors&#39; quarters. We have 
personal bathrooms.&quot;

&quot;Such luxury,&quot; Quistis said. &quot;I should take the test.&quot;

&quot;You should,&quot; said Xu, surprising herself with her vehemence. &quot;You&#39;d be 
a much better Instructor than most of the ones we have now, even if you 
are young. You&#39;re a credit to SeeD as you are, and you&#39;d make for a 
marvelous Instructor.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; said Quistis, and linked her arm with Xu&#39;s. &quot;Maybe I will.&quot;

* * *

Quistis placed one of her many Caterchipillar cards in the centre 
square, and leaned back. &quot;Your turn.&quot;

Xu took a sip from her tea and contemplated the sparse board. They 
always played with the Same and Plus rules in effect - &quot;without them, 
the game is just who&#39;s got the better cards&quot;, Xu had once said - and one 
of Quistis&#39; favourite tactics was to place a weak card in the centre 
space and lure Xu to take it. After that, she&#39;d have a good base to work 
Same and Plus from. &quot;How much combat was there in your mission?&quot; Xu 
asked, while she thought.

&quot;Very little, thankfully,&quot; said Quistis, sipping her own tea. She&#39;d made 
it herself - she always insisted on making the tea when they met, even 
though Xu always offered. &quot;We were very lucky.&quot;

Xu laid an Iron Giant card down. &quot;You were tracking down Galbadian 
deserters, weren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Quistis replied, laying down another card. &quot;One had gone into 
hiding with an FH resident. When we discovered him, he gave up without a 
struggle. I think the FH ideals had sunk in to him. He strongly resists 
extradition and wishes to be tried by an international court, but I 
don&#39;t believe we can offer that.&quot;

Xu nodded, and laid down one of her own cards. Quistis immediately set 
down a Tonberry and flipped all the cards on the board to her colour, 
with a Plus combo Xu had not anticipated at all.

&quot;Another had been making a walking trip to Esthar, but she misjudged the 
distance. We found her dehydrated and half-starved. She was in no 
condition to fight even if she&#39;d wanted to. We had to keep her alive 
with a Regen spell until we could get her into hospital. She&#39;s thankful 
for her life, but she resents us for stopping her escape attempt. She, 
too, strongly resists extradition.&quot;

Xu tentatively laid down a card. Quistis flipped it over with a much 
stronger one.

&quot;The last... had made his way along the other side of the Horizon 
Bridge, back to Galbadia. We had to track him down, and then spread out 
to find him. When we did, SeeD Rank 7 Callen and I were the only two in 
range. SeeD Callen attacked with a Sleep spell, which didn&#39;t take 
effect. He attacked SeeD Callen with a Fira spell, and followed that up 
with a blast of machine-gun fire. Even with his GF working through him, 
SeeD Callen was knocked down by the attack. I used a Life spell to keep 
him conscious and alive, and engaged the enemy with my whip. I managed 
to disarm him of his sword, and then used a Demi to weaken him before 
using a Sleep spell to end the battle. I assume we were then brought 
back to the hospital.&quot;

&quot;You assume?&quot; Xu asked, still wondering which of the two remaining 
places was the best to use her last-ditch effort.

&quot;Well, I was unconscious at the time,&quot; Quistis said.

&quot;You were hit?&quot; Xu asked. &quot;You didn&#39;t mention that.&quot;

Quistis tapped the right side of her abdomen. &quot;Here. Two bullets. My GF 
kept me alive long enough to get me to the hospital, and I assume the 
other SeeDs bolstered that with Cure spells. The soldier wouldn&#39;t talk 
to me when I visited his hospital bed, and had been restrained.&quot;

SeeD came so close to losing her, Xu thought, and chose to ignore that 
originally the first word in that sentence had been I. She laid down her 
Gilgamesh card in the top centre of the board, and Quistis laid down her 
last card, activating another Plus combo that turned the entire board 
blue once again.

&quot;You&#39;re a credit to SeeD and a consummate card player,&quot; Xu said, shaking 
her head, and was silent for a moment before deciding to add, &quot;and I am 
so proud of you.&quot;

&quot;Well, thank you,&quot; Quistis replied, and... is she blushing? Xu thought 
to herself. It wasn&#39;t particularly surprising - Quistis tended to react 
that way to the compliments she received all too infrequently.

&quot;We&#39;re playing by the One trade rule, aren&#39;t we?&quot; asked Xu, looking over 
her demolished cards.

&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessary...&quot;

&quot;I insist. And if you dare take a card besides Gilgamesh because you 
feel sorry for me...&quot;

Quistis laughed, and picked up Gilgamesh, sorting the card into her hand 
as she picked up her other cards. Then she looked at Xu, smiled for a 
moment, and handed the card back. &quot;As I recall, I forgot to get you 
something from FH. Here&#39;s a souvenir.&quot;

Xu smiled in return, and just as promptly handed the card back. &quot;I 
forgot to get you something myself. Here&#39;s a welcome home present, 
Quistis.&quot;

Quistis held the Gilgamesh card for a moment, before bursting into 
sudden laughter and very nearly upsetting her tea. Xu leaned back, 
smiling, and thinking what a wonderful thing Quistis&#39; laughter was.</pre>
