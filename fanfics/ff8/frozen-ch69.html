&quot;Slugs...&quot; Cid said skeptically.

&quot;That&#146;s what she said.&quot; Xu smirked.

&quot;No disrespect to the good doctor, but I find that hard to believe.&quot;

&quot;Me too.&quot; Squall said in a gruff, annoyed tone.

&quot;Well what do you think did it then?&quot; Zell asked, wiping his hands, it 
had taken the better part of the day and well into the evening to get 
the bridge systems cleaned out.

&quot;I don&#146;t know, but we need to find out, there has been too many things 
going on with the systems lately, I think it&#146;s all connected.&quot; Squall 
mused.

&quot;Sounds good to me, but what could cause it?&quot; Xu frowned

&quot;Yeah man, I&#146;ve worked with electronics all my life and I haven&#146;t seen 
anything like that before. Maybe the doc&#146;s right, hell it could&#146;ve been 
something that swam in when the training center flooded.&quot; Zell noted.

&quot;No, it&#146;s something else, I feel it, and I want to know what.&quot; Squall 
frowned.

&quot;Well boss, you&#146;re call, what do we do?&quot; Irvine asked.

&quot;I don&#146;t know yet, but I want everyone to keep their eyes peeled. How&#146;s 
things in the core looking?&quot; Squall answered.

&quot;No sign of beasties, but something was stinking up the place pretty 
bad. We searched the area but no one found anything.&quot; Irvine shrugged.

&quot;The Techs think it&#146;s probably a backed up sewer line somewhere.&quot; Zell 
explained.

&quot;Did it smell anything like this mess?&quot; Squall asked, gesturing to the 
buckets of cleaners and slop.

&quot;Kinda, but a helluva lot worse, man, I thought it was a dead animal.&quot; 
Zell responded.

&quot;It can&#146;t be coincidence.&quot; Xu frowned.

&quot;That&#146;s what I&#146;m thinking.&quot; Squall nodded.

&quot;Oh, I know what that means.&quot; Celest groaned.

&quot;More patrols in the core?&quot; Cid queried.

Squall nodded and folded his arms. &quot;Until we find out what&#146;s causing 
this. I think we&#146;ve been infested with something.&quot;

&quot;Dude, we searched that place top to bottom, we haven&#146;t found anything. 
Nest of slugs or otherwise.&quot; Zell protested.

&quot;Xu.&quot; Squall asked.

&quot;Yeah?&quot; The young woman sighed.

&quot;It could be a fungus?&quot; Nida blurted.

&quot;What?&quot; Everyone mumbled, looking at him.

&quot;Some kind of mold or fungus, some of those get kinda slimy. Once there 
was this green slime growing under my sink...&quot; He started then realized 
no one wanted to hear about his sink.

&quot;That&#146;s not a bad idea.&quot; Irvine nodded. &quot;I&#146;ve seen some nasty looking 
mold before.&quot;

&quot;Probably in your shorts.&quot; Zell chuckled briefly before Irvine grabbed 
him in a headlock and continued talking. &quot;You know, it could be similar 
to the stuff that grows on pond water.&quot;

Squall rolled the though over in his mind.

&quot;Makes since dude, we&#146;ve had some major humidity since we&#146;ve been 
floating in the ocean and with the pipe busting in the core. All that 
steam, man, it would only rise.&quot; Zell said, starting to agree with the 
theory.

&quot;Doctor Kadowaki said it was some kind of excretion though.&quot; Celest 
frowned.

&quot;In all fairness, Doctor Kadowaki isn&#146;t a specialist in molds and 
fungus&#146;, she could be wrong.&quot; Cid sighed then looked at Squall. &quot;Well 
son, what do you think?&quot;

&quot;I guess it&#146;s possible, but I don&#146;t think its likely. I still want 
everyone to keep and eye out for anything suspicious.&quot; Squall sighed 
rubbing his brow. &quot;Anything else?&quot;

&quot;Nope.&quot; Zell answered, after checking everyone&#146;s reactions.

&quot;You guys call it a night then, I&#146;ll stay up here for awhile.&quot; Squall 
ordered.

Everyone nodded cheerfully and quickly packed up the cleaning supplies.

 

&quot;A big house, huge, no, monstrous!&quot; Selphie giggled, spreading her arms.

&quot;You&#146;d waste all that money on a giant house.&quot; Nicole laughed.

&quot;Why not, I&#146;d throw parties all the time and walk around in my best 
dress and diamonds, sip wine out of crystal.&quot; Selphie grinned, stalking 
prissily around the seated group.

&quot;Why I never had you pegged as a materialist.&quot; Quistis chuckled.

&quot;Oh, like you wouldn&#146;t.&quot; Selphie said with an accusing grin.

&quot;Even if I were rich, I&#146;d spend it on something important. To be honest 
I&#146;d probably donate a lot of it.&quot; Quistis said thoughtfully.

&quot;I don&#146;t buy that.&quot; Rinoa grinned.

&quot;And why not?&quot; Quistis gawked.

&quot;Out of all of us, you have the most expensive wardrobe.&quot; Rinoa said 
knowingly. Fujin looked over at Quistis and smirked dryly.

&quot;Okay, fine, so I like to dress up.&quot; Quistis mumbled sheepishly.

&quot;I&#146;d buy a ranch.&quot; Nicole grinned.

&quot;EW!&quot; Selphie gagged. &quot;With cows and pigs and stuff?&quot;

&quot;No not with cows and pigs.&quot; Nicole snipped. &quot;A rustic place in the 
country, lots of wood and open spaces, a villa.&quot; She smiled dreamily.

&quot;You&#146;re as bad as Irvine.&quot; Selphie giggled.

&quot;I can&#146;t see Zell living out in the country.&quot; Rinoa chuckled.

&quot;He&#146;s a city boy through and through.&quot; Quistis grinned.

&quot;Oh, like Balamb is a sprawling metropolis.&quot; Nicole said smartly.

&quot;Okay, okay, point taken.&quot; Quistis said holding up her hands in defeat.

&quot;What about you Rinoa?&quot; Selphie asked curiously.

&quot;I don&#146;t care really, as long as I&#146;m with Squall.&quot; Rinoa smiled gently.

Quistis and Nicole sighed happily causing Fujin and Selphie exchange 
sour looks.

&quot;Oh please, that&#146;s lame.&quot; Selphie blurted, wagging a finger at Rinoa.

&quot;What?&quot; Rinoa giggled, leaning away from tiny woman.

&quot;I see you in someplace exciting, like a penthouse in Deling, though 
personally I&#146;d pick Esthar, I&#146;d love to live there someday.&quot; Selphie 
smiled hugely.

&quot;Oh no, not me, I like the peace and quiet.&quot; Rinoa laughed. &quot;I hated 
living in Deling, my dad was always dragging me to these stupid high 
town parties.&quot;

&quot;So you want the classic dream then?&quot; Selphie giggled. &quot;White picket 
fence and all that?&quot;

&quot;Well...yeah.&quot; Rinoa said quietly, blushing.

&quot;That&#146;s sweet.&quot; Nicole grinned.

Selphie rolled her eyes in disappointment before turning her eyes to 
Quistis.

&quot;What about you?&quot; She asked pointedly.

&quot;What about me?&quot; Quistis grinned.

&quot;You know what.&quot; Selphie smiled wickedly, leaning forward.

&quot;I don&#146;t know, honestly it never occurred to me to move. I&#146;ve been here 
most of my life, it&#146;s my home. I guess I always thought I&#146;d stay here 
forever.&quot;

&quot;Ew.&quot; Selphie frowned. &quot;What, just be a teacher?&quot;

&quot;What&#146;s wrong with teaching.&quot; Quistis frowned.

&quot;Nothing.&quot; Selphie amended quickly, not wanting upset her.

&quot;And no not just to teach, I always wanted be headmaster someday.&quot; 
Quistis said with a shy smile. Fujin looked at her in surprise, as did 
most everyone else. Nicole looked around and giggled.

&quot;Does Cid know you&#146;re after his job?&quot;

&quot;I am not.&quot; Quistis laughed.

&quot;Sure you&#146;re not.&quot; Selphie grinned, giving her a wink.

&quot;I can&#146;t tell you people anything.&quot; Quistis grumbled.

&quot;Apparently.&quot; Rinoa mumbled under her breath.

Quistis caught the comment but said nothing.

&quot;Fujin.&quot; Selphie grinned, looking at Fujin expectantly.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; She blurted in confusion.

&quot;Your turn.&quot;

&quot;NOT PARTICIPATING.&quot;

&quot;Oh bull, we all are.&quot; Selphie huffed.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Oh come on.&quot; Nicole prodded. &quot;Tell us, it&#146;d be nice to learn something 
about you. You&#146;re so secretive.&quot;

Quistis said nothing, but watched Fujin carefully, ready to step in.

&quot;NEVER CONSIDERED.&quot; Fujin shrugged, toying with her hair awkwardly.

&quot;Aw you must have.&quot; Selphie grinned.

&quot;NO POINT.&quot; Fujin said darkly.

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;NO HOPE.&quot; Fujin answered with chilling simplicity before standing. 
&quot;GETTING DRINK.&quot; She said quietly before leaving the gathering.

&quot;Fujin.&quot; Quistis called softly, hurrying after her.

&quot;Damn it.&quot; Selphie mumbled, feeling small, and insensitive.

&quot;Yeah really.&quot; Nicole mumbled.

Rinoa glanced over to where Quistis and Fujin stood by their coolers. 
She could hear Quistis whispering and Fujin&#146;s oddly timid replies. Fujin 
looked vulnerable and soft, something Rinoa would have never though 
possible.

Looking down thoughtfully Rinoa solemnly as she began to understand. 
Smiling to herself, she looked back up at Selphie, who was looking 
downtrodden and upset about the incident.

&quot;It&#146;ll be okay.&quot; She said warmly.

&quot;What?&quot; Selphie blinked, not following her.

&quot;Nothing.&quot; Rinoa grinned warmly.

Quistis walked back to the group, leading a sullen Fujin by the hand. 
The two sat down quietly and Quisits pulled Fujin back against her chest 
and wrapped her arms comfortably around her. Fujin stiffened slightly, 
unsure how to react to the open gesture of affection. Quistis gave her a 
little reassuring squeeze and she calmed considerably. Nicole smiled 
warmly at them, while Selphie quietly sipped her drink. A moment of 
peaceful silence past and Rinoa rested back on her hands. Looking up 
through the large skylight at the evening stars she sighed.

&quot;We need a fire.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t think that would be a good idea.&quot; Nicole giggled.

&quot;I know, I was just saying it&#146;d be nice. You know, back when I was with 
the Timber Owls, there&#146;d be nights like this where we&#146;d just go lay 
outside atop the train and watch the stars. Pointing out constellations 
or just making them up.&quot; She grinned.

&quot;Awww that&#146;s positively boring.&quot; Selphie cooed, fluttering her eyes.

Quistis snickered and Nicole gawked in surprise.

&quot;Oh gee thanks, see if I try to share something touching again.&quot; Rinoa 
huffed; turning her back to Selphie who was tittering maniacally.

&quot;DOUBTFUL.&quot; Fujin said quietly.

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis grinned, leaning over her shoulder.

&quot;THEY ARE FRIENDS.&quot; Fujin nodded, to the squabbling duo.

&quot;Its all in fun, you know that.&quot; Quistis winked.

&quot;You know you&#146;re going to be one of the most envied people in all the 
Garden.&quot; Nicole said, leaning over towards Fujin.

Fujin looked at her uncomprehendingly, as did Quistis.

&quot;EXPLAIN.&quot; Fujin frowned, uncomprehendingly

&quot;For as long as I can recall, Quisty here has been lusted after by 
nearly every guy in Balamb.

&quot;And a few girls apparently.&quot; Selphie giggled scandalously, earning more 
than a few scornful looks.

&quot;Please.&quot; Quistis sighed, rolling her eyes. &quot;It&#146;s not as bad as all 
that. Ignore them Fujin.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, ignore us Fujin, just wait until the school season starts again.&quot; 
Selphie smiled knowingly. &quot;You thought the flowers and apples where bad 
Trepe. I bet things will be ten times worse now.&quot;

&quot;Bah.&quot; Quistis scoffed, waving her away.

&quot;Glad to see you&#146;re all enjoying yourselves.&quot; Irvine said dully, as he 
walked towards them. Zell, Squall and Xu followed close behind jabbering 
on about slugs, molds and fungi.

&quot;Little late and cold to be swimming isn&#146;t it?&quot; Xu said, looking 
skeptically at the glittering pool water. &quot;Sorry about hauling the guys 
off, we had some problems on the bridge.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s okay, we heard. We&#146;ve just been sitting around chatting anyway.&quot;

Quistis shrugged, hugging Fujin warmly.

&quot;Chatting eh?&quot; Irvine mumbled, slightly worried.

&quot;Yeah, girl talk, you know how it is.&quot; Selphie giggled, jumping up to 
kiss him on the cheek.

&quot;Where&#146;s Celest?&quot; Nicole asked, looking around.

&quot;She got grossed out and went home.&quot; Zell chuckled.

&quot;Really, what happened up there anyway?&quot; Quistis asked, anything major I 
should know about?&quot;

&quot;Something snotted up the inside of the bridge computers.&quot; Zell said 
simply.

&quot;Gross.&quot; Rinoa frowned, sticking her tongue out in disgust.

&quot;Where were you at by the way?&quot; Xu asked, noticing Fujin.

&quot;HERE.&quot; Fujin answered simply.

&quot;I didn&#146;t see you, where were you at?&quot;

Fujin pointed towards the shadowed area she had been lounging in 
earlier.

&quot;Why didn&#146;t you help us clean up?&quot; Xu grumbled, folding her arms 
sternly.

&quot;DIDN&#146;T ASK.&quot; Fujin shrugged.

&quot;Oh!&quot; Xu snarled in aggravation and looked to Irvine and Zell. The two 
men looked at each other and nodded. Fujin caught the exchange and 
started to rise, sensing impending mischief. Untangling herself from 
Quistis, she started to rise but it was too late. Charging forward, 
Irvine and Zell scooped both women up and did a kamikaze charge into the 
pool.

 

After the brief fiasco at the pool, everyone had decided to call it a 
night. Following a shower and quaint dinner the two sat in the middle of 
Quistis&#146; living room floor listening to romantic music.

&quot;ANNOYED.&quot; Fujin grumbled as she sat brushing out Quistis&#146; hair.

&quot;You&#146;re still sulking about being dunked in the pool?&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;RUDE.&quot; Fujin huffed.

&quot;Please, it was in fun.&quot;

&quot;HUMPF.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re just mad because you got caught off guard.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t start.&quot; Quistis said firmly, pinching her thigh. In retaliation; 
Fujin lightly smacked her atop the head.

&quot;Feels better doesn&#146;t it.&quot; Quistis said quietly as Fujin resumed her 
brushing.

Fujin nodded, knowing what she meant.

&quot;To bad Aeka is gone, I know she&#146;d be happy to hear.&quot;

Fujin smiled in quiet agreement, glancing up to where Quistis had 
mounted the girl&#146;s diploma amid cherished photos.

&quot;I think she knew we&#146;d end up together before I did.&quot; Quistis smiled.

&quot;PERHAPS.&quot; Fujin smirked.

&quot;I should call Royce...See how he&#146;s doing.&quot;

&quot;WISE?&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t know. He was in so much pain; I hated to see him go. I wish he 
let me help.&quot; Quistis sighed.

Fujin hugged her gently and smiled.

&quot;WILL BE OKAY.&quot; She said as reassuringly as she could manage.

A knock on the door made Quistis hang her head in defeat. Fujin groaned 
in agreement.

&quot;That&#146;s it, from now on, we spend the night at your place.&quot; Quistis 
sighed, standing up.

Fujin set the brush on the table and climbed onto the couch.

Tightening her housecoat she opened the door slightly and peeked out.

&quot;Yes...&quot; She said grudgingly.

&quot;Hi.&quot; Celest said meekly.

&quot;Is something on fire?&quot; Quistis asked.

&quot;Um no.&quot; Celest answered slowly, not understanding.

&quot;Did something blow up?&quot;

&quot;Um... that I know of.&quot;

&quot;Some one go nuts?&quot;

&quot;Not that I&#146;m aware of.&quot; Celest frowned.

&quot;Okay... then I know something is really wrong.&quot; Quistis sighed and 
opened the door.

&quot;Am I interrupting something?&quot; Celest squeaked; noticing the bathrobes 
Fujin and Quistis wore.

&quot;No.&quot; Quistis smiled

&quot;YES.&quot; Fujin mumbled loudly.

&quot;No.&quot; Quistis said again, giving Fujin a stern look.

&quot;YE...&quot; Fujin started, but a searing glare from Quistis silenced her.

&quot;I uh, wanted to talk to someone and you seem to be the one with all the 
answers.&quot; Celest said quietly as Quistis motioned her inside.

&quot;Hardly.&quot; Quistis chuckled, going to the kitchen to fix them all drinks.

&quot;Hiya Fu.&quot; Celest smiled, sitting down opposite of her.

&quot;FUJIN.&quot; Fujin said bluntly.

&quot;Sorry.&quot; Celest said awkwardly.

&quot;Fujin be nice.&quot; Quistis scolded. &quot;Ignore her Celest, she&#146;s mad at Zell 
and Irvine.&quot;

&quot;What did they do now?&quot;

&quot;Tossed her in the pool.&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;NOT FUNNY.&quot; Fujin snorted.

&quot;Did you hear about what happened?&quot; Celest asked, changing the subject.

&quot;On the bridge?&quot; Quistis clarified.

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Something fouled everything up from what I hear.&quot;

&quot;Oh it was disgusting.&quot; Celest shivered.

&quot;I heard that too.&quot; Quistis chuckled, walking back into the living room.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Celest smiled, as Quistis offered her and Fujin a cup of hot 
tea.

&quot;Okay then.&quot; Quistis started as she sat down. &quot;What can I help you 
with?&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t know.&quot; Celest sighed sadly.

Fujin rolled her eye and rested back against the couch wearily.

&quot;Well try.&quot; Quistis smiled apologetically.

&quot;That&#146;s the problem, I don&#146;t know...&quot; Celest

&quot;Don&#146;t know what?&quot;

&quot;Anything.&quot; Celest moaned, looking about ready to cry.

&quot;Um that&#146;s a little broad hon.&quot; Quistis smiled gently.

&quot;I try, I really do.&quot;

&quot;Try what hon?&quot; Quistis asked, growing slightly exasperated.

&quot;What&#146;s expected, but everyone gives me mixed signals...&quot; Celest 
answered quietly. Quistis nodded as she started gaining some perspective 
on the problem.

&quot;Go on.&quot; She prodded; hopping Celest could be more forthcoming.

&quot;I&#146;m not used to this...&quot;

&quot;Where did this come from? Is this about Kevin still?&quot; Quistis frowned, 
apparently she was taking his rejection harder than anyone realized.

&quot;Yes and no, it&#146;s about all of you.&quot; Celest frowned.

&quot;What did we do?&quot; Quistis balked, looking at Fujin who could only shrug.

&quot;Back in Galbadia I aced all my courses, I was top of my class, everyone 
looked up to me, I was popular. You know, I was part of the in crowd.&quot;

&quot;But I come here I get treated like crap. When I first came here only 
creeps would ask me out and now no one does! I mean, not to be shallow, 
but I think I look good, and I always try to be nice to people. Then you 
guys start saying I spook people and dress like a tramp, then Kevin 
pretty much drags me through the mud...he didn&#146;t even take the time to 
get to know me...&quot; She sniffed, looking down in defeat. &quot;What did I do 
to make everyone hate me so much?&quot;

Quistis frowned sadly and took a breath before replying.

&quot;Celest no one hates you, it&#146;s just the opposite, we&#146;re your friends, we 
love you to death.&quot;

&quot;Then why do you all say these things about me?&quot; Celest murmured weakly.

&quot;What things?&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;Talking about the way I dress and act...&quot;

Quistis frowned, this was obviously a touchy subject and she wasn&#146;t sure 
how to explain it without hurting her feelings further.

&quot;Okay Celest, I know what we&#146;ve told you...umm...&quot; She paused trying to 
find the right words. &quot;The clothes, the make up, the hair, all of that 
is too much, I mean, hon... it makes you look....&quot; She paused again this 
for an agonizingly long time.

&quot;CHEAP.&quot; Fujin blurted, getting fed up with the song and dance.

&quot;SEE!&quot; Celest cried, bursting into tears. Fujin looked startled by the 
outburst and Quistis hung her head a moment before looking at her.

&quot;TRYING TO HELP.&quot; Fujin mumbled awkwardly, folding her arms.

&quot;I know...um thanks...but, I&#146;ll handle it hon.&quot; Quistis winced, smiling 
awkwardly before getting up and sitting beside the bawling Celest.

&quot;Um...okay...Celest, listen.&quot; Quistis sighed, putting a comforting arm 
around her shoulder. &quot;We only tell you this because we care, we don&#146;t 
want to see you embarrass yourself.&quot;

&quot;None of my friends in Galbadia ever said anything like that. They liked 
the way I dressed and acted...&quot; Celest murmured behind tears.

&quot;Okay, I&#146;m beginning to understand.&quot; Quistis chuckled causing Fujin and 
Celest both, to look at her warily.

&quot;What&#146;s so funny.&quot; Celest frowned, feeling offended.

&quot;You say you were the most popular person in your class right?&quot; Quistis 
said sadly. Celest nodded somberly.

&quot;Did you act or dress like you do now, before you went to Galbadia?&quot;

&quot;Not really.&quot;

&quot;Okay, keep that in mind hon.&quot;

&quot;When you started, everyone you knew were teenagers, all hormones. Lets 
face facts hon, you&#146;re beautiful.&quot; Quistis grinned, Fujin arched a wary 
brow at her. Quistis caught the look and rolled her eyes at her and 
winked.

&quot;I guess...&quot; Celest mumbled.

&quot;You liked the attention the guys gave you and dressed accordingly, 
somewhere along the line you got led astray, perhaps you started hanging 
out with some girls who were a bad influence, or you just got carried 
away. Regardless how it happened, at some point you went overboard hon. 
I see it similar things all the time with my own students.&quot;

&quot;See what?&quot;

&quot;These friends of yours, do they call you, do they write, do they 
visit?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;Hon... I know what&#146;s happened, I see something similar happen every 
year with my own students. All those people who hung around you claiming 
to be you&#146;re friends were only because being around you made them seem 
cool. You yourself said you were the most popular person in your class. 
These friends of yours were so busy riding you&#146;re popularity they didn&#146;t 
bother telling you things real friends do. They only told you what you 
wanted to hear. Celest, hon, you&#146;re not used to hearing the truth...&quot; 
Quistis said quietly, feeling horrible.

&quot;I get it.&quot; Celest sighed. &quot;I&#146;m just a joke. They used me to make 
themselves popular and they let me make a proper ass of myself. I&#146;m just 
some object, some thing to be gawked at.&quot;

&quot;No you&#146;re not, you just have to quit trying to be what other people 
want you to be. The cleavage, the mini skirts, the flirty act, that&#146;s 
not you and as you&#146;re friend... I&#146;m telling you that you don&#146;t have to 
act that way to be popular. I know it sounds corny, but just be 
yourself.&quot; Quistis smiled.

Celest shook her head and chuckled in spite of herself,

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis asked grinning.

&quot;I feel like I&#146;m in some after school special.&quot;

&quot;Am I making any sense hon?&quot; Quistis asked, trying to be cheerful.

&quot;Yeah... But, I don&#146;t even know who I am anymore... I don&#146;t know how to 
act... I don&#146;t how to deal with this...&quot;

&quot;ONE DAY AT TIME.&quot; Fujin said somberly.

Quistis smiled to her and looked back at Celest.

&quot;She&#146;s right hon, do whatever you need to, to be comfortably. But just 
know that we all care for you. You don&#146;t have to fit some preconceived 
notion of what people expect. We just want you to be yourself, and be 
happy doing it.. People will react you better when you are true to 
yourself.&quot; Quistis explained somewhat sagely.

&quot;I don&#146;t know...I feel like such an idiot.&quot; Celest said quietly.

&quot;It&#146;s okay.&quot; Quistis tried, hoping to brighten her spirits.

&quot;I guess I&#146;ve got a lot to think about.

&quot;Yes you do, I hope I helped, I&#146;d hate to make things worse.&quot;

&quot;Yes and no.&quot; Celest said truthfully. &quot;But thank you, I&#146;m glad you cared 
enough to point it out... I guess I never had any friends until now.&quot;

&quot;KINDA SCARY.&quot; Fujin said sympathetically garnering a look of pleasant 
surprise from Quistis.

&quot;Yeah, yeah it is.&quot; Celest sighed, looking up sadly. &quot;Thanks...&quot;

Quistis hugged her warmly and Celest sniffled slightly.

&quot;Feel better?&quot; Quistis asked quietly.

&quot;I guess so... but I still don&#146;t know what to do now.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;ll figure it out, have faith.&quot;

&quot;I hope you&#146;re right.&quot;

&quot;We&#146;ll see, won&#146;t we.&quot; Quistis said with a wink.

Celest wiped her eyes and chuckled. &quot;Look at me, I&#146;m a mess.&quot;

&quot;Yup, and its okay.&quot; Quistis grinned.

&quot;I get it.&quot; Celest grinned, rising to her feet. &quot;I uh, guess I took up 
enough of you time, I&#146;ll be going now.&quot;

&quot;You don&#146;t have to, we were just sitting her listening to music and 
talking, you&#146;re more than welcome to join us.&quot; Quistis offered politely.

&quot;That&#146;s sweet, it really is, but I really should go, I&#146;ve a lot to think 
about.&quot;

&quot;You sure?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I think so.&quot;

&quot;Okay hon, take care, see you tomorrow.&quot; Quistis smiled as they walked 
to the door.

&quot;Bye Quisty, thanks.&quot; Celest said quietly then waved at Fujin. &quot;Bye.&quot;

Fujin nodded courteously and stood as Quistis shut the door.

&quot;BE OKAY?&quot; Fujin asked thoughtfully.

&quot;I think so, poor thing is so confused.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;WISE.&quot;

&quot;Who me?&quot;

&quot;YES.&quot;

&quot;Hah, hardly, look how well its served me so far.&quot;

&quot;YES, LOOK.&quot; Fujin smiled.

&quot;If you say so.&quot; Quistis sighed, walking towards her.

&quot;OLD SOUL.&quot;

&quot;You calling me old?&quot; Quistis pouted.

&quot;FIGURE SPEECH.&quot;

&quot;I know, I&#146;m just be facetious.&quot;

&quot;WORRISOME.&quot; Fujin huffed.

&quot;I know that too.&quot; Quistis winked, wrapping her arms around her.

 

The next morning, Cid and Nida walked onto the bridge and were startled 
to find Squall still at the helm.

&quot;You&#146;ve been here all night?&quot; Nida asked worriedly. Squall didn&#146;t answer 
but the other bridge staff looked at him and nodded worriedly.

Squall was only barely aware of the question, his mind had been troubled 
with the recent events along with the issues of self-doubt the day 
before.

&quot;Get some sleep man, you look like crap.&quot; Nida said getting his 
attention. Squall nodded and relinquished the controls as Cid gestured 
him over to him.

&quot;Squall, lets go to my office, get some coffee in you, have a talk.&quot; He 
said in a fatherly tone. Squall rolled his eyes but did as he was told. 
After the brief walk the tow men entered Cid&#146;s office and sat down.

&quot;Grace?&quot; Cid called into his intercom.

&quot;Yes sir?&quot; The secretary answered.

&quot;Two coffee&#146;s please.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir.&quot; The young woman answered cheerfully.

Squall looked haggard.

&quot;Want to talk about it?&quot; Cid asked, but knew Squall would refuse, and 
true to form he did.

&quot;No, I&#146;ll be fine, just under the weather.&quot; He said dully.

&quot;Alright then, if that&#146;s how you want to play it.&quot; Cid sighed, then 
glanced at his schedule book. &quot;I&#146;ve a meeting to get out of the way with 
the teaching staff before they all go on vacation. So I&#146;ll be gone most 
of the day. I need you to do me a favor.&quot; He said as the Secretary 
brought them their coffee&#146;s

&quot;What is it?&quot; Squall asked as he sipped his drink.

&quot;Selphie and Irvine&#146;s wedding, they decided to have it in Esthar.&quot;

&quot;Odd I would have thought Selphie wanted to have it in Trabia.&quot; Squall 
said curiously. Cid nodded in agreement and sighed.

&quot;She did, but with the reconstruction still underway they really don&#146;t 
have the to resources or facilities.&quot;

&quot;Okay then, what this have to do with me?&quot; Squall asked bluntly.

&quot;I need you to contact Laguna, ask him if he can help set something up. 
Selphie really idolizes him, I think she&#146;d get a big surprise out of it 
if he was involved.

&quot;Why me?&quot; Squall sighed, having no desire to talk to Laguna.

&quot;He&#146;d like to hear from you, besides you two need to talk.&quot; Cid smirked, 
as he gathered papers.

&quot;Sir, can&#146;t you get Quistis to do it. She&#146;s better at this sort of 
thing.&quot;

&quot;Another reason I want you to do it. You need to work on your people 
skills.&quot;

&quot;Whatever.&quot;

&quot;See.&quot; Cid chuckled. &quot;That&#146;s what I mean. Just call him, ask him if he 
can help out. Try to keep it a secret, I don&#146;t want Selphie to know 
Laguna&#146;s involved.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot; Squall sighed.

&quot;That&#146;s a good lad.&quot; Cid grinned as he gathered his papers.

&quot;I still think you should get someone else.&quot; Squall groaned.

&quot;Just call.&quot; Cid sighed, handing him the phone as he prepared to leave. 
&quot;I&#146;m going now, I&#146;ll talk to you later.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir.&quot; Squall waved half-heartedly as Cid left him alone.

Squall moaned and glared at the phone sourly for a lone while. After 
what seemed like an eternity he picked it up gruffly and dialed. A few 
moments later he was going through the channels and runaround associated 
with trying to contact a head of state. After more than a few harrowing 
and annoying hours he finally go through to Kiros.

&quot;Squall?&quot; Kiros said brightly. &quot;What a surprise to hear from you.&quot;

&quot;I need to talk to Laguna.&quot; Squall droned, sounding about as 
enthusiastic as a slug in a saltshaker.

&quot;Everything okay? You sound like there&#146;s a problem?&quot;

&quot;No, I just need to talk to him.&quot; Squall sighed, he felt ill.

&quot;Alright then, hold on, I&#146;ll connect you.&quot;

After a few minutes Laguna was on the line, Squall could hear him 
babbling in the background to someone.

&quot;Squall? Is that you?&quot; He finally beamed.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Squall sighed.

&quot;Great to hear from you. Everything okay?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;What&#146;s up, I am sure you&#146;re not calling to chat.&quot; Laguna laughed.

&quot;I need you&#146;re assistance.&quot;

&quot;Name it! I&#146;ll help anyway I can.&quot; Laguna offered eagerly.

&quot;I need you to help set up a wedding for next weekend.&quot;

&quot;WEDDING!&quot; Laguna blurted excitedly.

&quot;Yes, wedding.&quot;

&quot;HOLY! This is wonderful!&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Tell me all about it!? How, I mean, you know?&quot;

&quot;Long story.&quot;

&quot;How many people?&quot;

&quot;A hundred or so at least.&quot;

&quot;What do you need of me!?&quot;

&quot;We have the suits and dresses already in the works. We just need to set 
up the services and nice place to hold it.&quot;

&quot;I know just the right place! By the gods you&#146;ll have it in the 
presidential palace.&quot; Laguna proclaimed in a grandiose manner.

&quot;Works for me, just don&#146;t mention it to anyone here. We&#146;re trying to 
keep it a surprise.&quot; Squall sighed.

&quot;Of course, of course! When can I expect you all to arrive.&quot;

&quot;We&#146;ll drop off some people to help set things up. We can have them 
there in just a couple of days. Then we go pick up the guests from 
Trabia that should be about the end of the week, right before the 
wedding.&quot; Squall explained woodenly.

&quot;Keeping it tight I see.&quot; Laguna whistled. &quot;I can do it! I&#146;ll have my 
people working round the clock, I&#146;ll see you in a few days.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Squall sighed, happy that things were going so smoothly.

&quot;Congratulations, well I have to go get things set up, this is so 
exciting! There&#146;s so much to do!!&quot; Laguna babbled.

&quot;I&#146;ll leave you to it then.&quot; Squall said eagerly then hung up. With a 
heavy sigh he stood and looked at the phone. Somehow, he had a feelings 
somehow, someway, things would wrong, he just wasn&#146;t sure how.

 

&quot;What was that all about?&quot; Ellone asked cheerfully, from a nearby seat.

Laguna ran over to her and swept her into the air.

&quot;It&#146;s wonderful!&quot; He laughed brightly.

&quot;What is?&quot; Ellone giggled as he spun her around.

&quot;Squalls getting married!!&quot; Laguna beamed proudly.
