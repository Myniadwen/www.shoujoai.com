No one knew what to say or do. Everything had happened so fast no one 
had the time to even take it all in correctly. Edea had sacrificed 
herself for Seifer and taken Griever with her. The containment chamber 
cracked with energy as everyone stood in quiet shock. Edea&#146;s form was 
vaguely visible through the dusky blue, glasslike substance that had 
filled the chamber. She appeared to be floating at the heart of a 
marble, with hues of blue and green frozen in swirls around her. Squall 
took a quiet step forward and touched the field, a crackle of energy 
dancing along his fingertips.

The matron was frozen still, her expression would&#146;ve been serene if not 
for an unholy red glow that radiated from her eyes.

&quot;She&#146;s gone.&quot; Squall said in a stiff awkward tone, unable to manage 
anything more coherent.

&quot;We have to get her out!&quot; Selphie shouted, running forward and clinging 
to his arm.

&quot;Squall is right, she&#146;s gone, Griever is alone in his tomb.&quot; Cid sighed 
softly.

&quot;You mean, she&#146;s dead.&quot; Selphie murmured and sunk to the floor.

&quot;It is better that way, I would not want to think she was trapped in 
there with that monster.&quot; Cid frowned and wiped his eyes somberly.

&quot;How can you be so calm about this!&quot; Zell erupted in a fit of anguish.

Fujin grabbed him and pulled him aside.

&quot;LISTEN.&quot; She hissed under her breath.

&quot;Ultimecia had been inside her far too long.&quot; Cid said quietly as he 
approached the chamber tentatively. &quot;She told me when we were reunited. 
It was only a matter of time.&quot;

&quot;Sir.&quot; Irvine said in a subdued tone. &quot;Why didn&#146;t she tell us, we 
could&#146;ve have done something?&quot;

&quot;There was nothing to be done.&quot; Cid responded, looking over his shoulder 
at the tall youth. &quot;She did not want to worry any of you, she knew you&#146;d 
treat her differently.&quot;

&quot;I, I have to go outside.&quot; Quistis gasped and staggered towards the 
exit. It was too much for her to handle. There was just too much to deal 
with and it was coming far to fast, drowning her in a sea of guilt, 
heartache, pain and sorrow. Fujin went after her as Cid watched 
sympathetically, he knew the suffering the instructor must be going 
through but was powerless to help.

&quot;I can&#146;t believe this!&quot; Zell blurted in a mix of anger and misery 
causing everyone to look at him.

&quot;She didn&#146;t deserve this. No one deserved this; it&#146;s that damned 
Ultimecia&#146;s fault. What the hell is this man, we beat her, so why does 
it feel like we lost!? It&#146;s not fair, it&#146;s just not friggin fair!&quot; He 
shouted, kicking over a computer terminal before storming out.

&quot;What now.&quot; Squall asked Cid softly, his eyes cloudy and tired.

Cid looked at his wife one last time and closed his eyes, after a long 
moment he looked up and smiled lovingly at her, before looking at Squall 
with a soft smile.

&quot;Let&#146;s go home lad.&quot; He whispered and walked quietly towards the exit.

Selphie ran to him and hugged against him crying softly with Rinoa 
following quietly behind. Irvine walked to Squall&#146;s side and nodded 
towards Seifer, who was still kneeling before the chamber with head hung 
low and shoulders slumped in defeat.

&quot;What do we do about him?&quot; He asked quietly.

&quot;I don&#146;t know.&quot; Squall sighed and walked over to pull Seifer to his 
feet.

&quot;Why?&quot; Seifer asked shakily with a distant look in his eyes.

&quot;Come on.&quot; Squall murmured as he led him away.

***********************

It was decided that Edea and Aeka&#146;s services would be held together. No 
one wanted to draw the pain out any longer than necessary. Everyone 
gathered on a grassy hill overlooking the ocean near Balamb village. 
Quiet and respectful, the funerals were sobering to the newest additions 
to Balamb Garden, destroying any naivet&eacute; about the risks of being a 
SEED. One by one the senior staff and graduate SEED&#146;s reminisced about 
Edea&#146;s life, notably absent was any mention of her deeds while under 
control of Ultimecia. Though weary and depressed Aeka&#146;s classmates also 
spoke. Recalling the young woman&#146;s kindness and love of life.

Of all the speakers, Quistis was the most disturbed she was particularly 
close to Aeka, and Edea both. Though she kept composed, her grief was 
apparent to all; even Cid was faring better. Royce declined to speak, 
still suffering through pain and guilt. Seifer was notably absent, 
having been inconsolable ever sense the tragedy.

It was sunset when things wound down; Quistis, Fujin and Royce stood 
quietly on the edge of the cliff as she last rays of the sun washed over 
them. Quietly Quistis opened the small urn that held Aeka&#146;s ashes and 
cast them into the air where they lingered lazily before drifting down 
to the waters below.

&quot;I&#146;m leaving Balamb.&quot; Royce said in a reserved tone.

Quistis looked somewhat disappointed by the news while Fujin seemed to 
expect it.

&quot;For how long?&quot; Quistis asked quietly, still looking down at the waters 
below.

&quot;For good, I need to rethink what I want to do with my life.&quot; Royce said 
sullenly.

Quistis took a deep breath then nodded. &quot;If that&#146;s what you want, you&#146;re 
an adult, you can make your on decisions. When?&quot;

&quot;Tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;So soon, have you told you classmates?&quot;

&quot;No, I can&#146;t talk to them. I think it&#146;s best if I just go.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; Quistis sighed. &quot;You&#146;ll be missed.&quot;

&quot;I appreciate it but I doubt it, not after all of this.&quot;

&quot;No one blames you Royce.&quot;

&quot;I know, but I still blame myself.&quot;

&quot;Royce.&quot;

&quot;Goodbye Miss Trepe.&quot; He said solemnly and turned away to leave but 
paused. &quot;I was told she was cremated in uniform.&quot;

&quot;She was SEED.&quot; Quistis said quietly, her eyes still locked on the 
darkening waters.

&quot;Thank you for that.&quot; Royce smiled faintly.

&quot;Goodbye Royce.&quot; Quistis responded awkwardly, unable to continue the 
conversation. Wordlessly Royce departed, leaving the two women alone.

&quot;NOT STOP HIM?&quot; Fujin asked curiously.

&quot;I can&#146;t, I have no right telling anyone what to do anymore.&quot; Quistis 
said in a tone thick with regret and grief.

&quot;DON&#146;T THINK LIKE THAT.&quot; Fujin frowned, even after all that was said, 
both Quistis and Royce still blamed themselves for Aeka&#146;s death.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry, really. I&#146;m just tired, when does this stop?&quot; Quistis 
sniffed wearily. &quot;And poor Cid, what is he going to do? With Edea gone 
he&#146;ll be so alone again.&quot; She murmured.

&quot;IT&#146;LL BE OKAY.&quot; Fujin said softly, pulling her into a gentle embrace.

An awkward cough caught their attention and Quistis looked up blushing 
slightly and wiping her eyes. Zell stood nearby with hands stuffed 
meekly in his pockets. Quistis smiled lightly at him, bless him, he 
seemed so out of place in a suit.

&quot;Sorry if I&#146;m interrupting, but we&#146;re getting ready to head back to the 
Garden, I can um, wait a little bit if you want.&quot; He said timidly.

Quistis stepped forward and hugged him tightly earning a momentary look 
of surprise.

&quot;It&#146;s okay we&#146;re ready to go.&quot; She said wistfully, taking Fujin&#146;s hand 
before following him back to the others.

***********************

That evening, Balamb garden was at a standstill, few souls wandered its 
quiet halls. Irvine Kinneas was one of them, Selphie had cried herself 
to sleep and he needed to get out to sort through his thoughts. He soon 
found himself alone on one of Balamb&#146;s many scenic balconies. With a 
sigh he slipped a package of cigarettes from his pocket. It was a nasty 
habit, but it calmed his nerves in times of stress, and with all things 
considered he allowed himself the indulgence.

&quot;DISGUSTING.&quot; Fujin said from the shadows startling him.

&quot;For the love of!&quot; Irvine jumped, nearly fumbling the freshly lit 
cigarette. He peered searchingly into the shadows and give her a 
scathing look. &quot;Your demented, Quistis is right, you do that on 
purpose.&quot;

Fujin didn&#146;t respond to his accusation.

&quot;How&#146;s she doin by the way?&quot; Irvine asked.

&quot;POORLY.&quot;

&quot;Sorry to hear that, I tried to talk to her earlier but she wouldn&#146;t 
even answer the door.&quot;

&quot;I KNOW.&quot; Fujin grumbled.

&quot;I take it you had no luck with her either.&quot;

&quot;MARGINAL.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;ve never seen her this depressed, it&#146;s not like her.&quot;

Fujin arched a brow, surprised at how little Quistis&#146; friends really 
knew her at times.

&quot;I wonder what&#146;s to become of Seifer.&quot; Irvine added almost absently.

&quot;DON&#146;T CARE.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s kinda harsh, I can&#146;t blame you though, all things considered.&quot;

Fujin stepped from the shadows and folded her arms.

&quot;It&#146;s been a helluva ride hasn&#146;t it.&quot; Irvine continued quietly, blowing 
a puff of smoke from the corner of his mouth.

&quot;INDEED.&quot; Fujin mused.

A long moment went by as they stood in quiet reflection. Finally Irvine 
gazed at her sideways and smirked lightly.

&quot;You know gal, I&#146;ve got to say you really surprised me.&quot;

Fujin looked at him curiously, unsure what to make of the statement.

&quot;HOW SO?&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re not the person I thought you were.&quot;

&quot;IF YOU SAY.&quot;

&quot;I do.&quot; Irvine said flatly, exhaling a cloud of smoke.

Fujin wasn&#146;t terribly happy about being the topic of the conversation 
and her expression showed it.

&quot;You don&#146;t like to talk about yourself much do you?&quot;

&quot;NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.&quot;

&quot;Quistis doesn&#146;t think so. Its obvious she thinks the world of you. It&#146;s 
a good thing you came along; she needs a friend like you, especially 
now. I wish she&#146;d come to us like she does you. I don&#146;t know; I guess 
she feels awkward coming to us, ya know, with her being the only single 
one and all. Now if only we could find her a nice guy to settle down 
with.&quot; He said thoughtfully then noticed the foul look Fujin was giving 
him. Stammering on his words he amended his statement. &quot;I&#146;m sure I can 
hook you up too, don&#146;t worry, I know several nice guys who&#146;d be 
interested.&quot;

&quot;GOOD NIGHT.&quot; Fujin said icily as she stalked away.

&quot;What!?&quot; Irvine called after her, totally caught off guard by her sudden 
gruffness.

*******************

Rinoa lay next to Squall running her fingertips along the curves of his 
back. He had spoken little to her since they arrived back at their 
apartment. She wished he&#146;d talk to her, the silence was killing her. 
Pressing close she kissed his shoulder.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry.&quot; She said softly.

&quot;Why? You did nothing wrong.&quot; He responded quietly still facing away 
from her.

&quot;For loosing her.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t be, its over now.&quot;

&quot;She was like your mother wasn&#146;t she?&quot;

&quot;Once, but that was a long time ago.&quot;

&quot;Still, I know it hurts, when my mother died...&quot;

&quot;She wasn&#146;t my mother, we weren&#146;t even that close, she just took care of 
us for a while then disappeared.&quot;

&quot;You can&#146;t blame her for that.&quot;

&quot;I know that now, but at the time I didn&#146;t. Still, the fact remains, she 
wasn&#146;t there and now I can&#146;t pretend to have feelings that were never 
there to begin with. Yes, I&#146;m upset that she died but that&#146;s life. Quit 
trying to read into things like you know what&#146;s going on.&quot; He whispered 
sharply.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Rinoa murmured slightly hurt by his words. &quot;But why..?&quot; She 
started then paused not wanting to upset him further.

&quot;What?&quot; Squall sighed closing his eyes, just wanting to put the entire 
incident behind him.

&quot;Why are you so upset then? You&#146;ve been short, and moody for days, even 
before all of this blew up.&quot; Squall asked timidly.

Squall could have laughed at the audacity of the question.

&quot;Just drop it.&quot; He grumbled.

&quot;I&#146;m just trying to help.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t need your help, I just want to sleep!&quot; Squall growled.

&quot;Don&#146;t talk to me that way.&quot; Rinoa frowned.

&quot;What way? You sit here, after all that we&#146;ve been through over the last 
few weeks and ask me what&#146;s wrong. What!? You want me to make a list; 
I&#146;d be here all night! Just leave me alone.&quot; He snapped irritably. 
Rinoa&#146;s features trembled and she turned away from him silently. She 
drew the blankets up around her as tears burned her eyes.

***************

Nicole was perched atop the bed painting her toenails as Zell walking 
into to room wrapped in a towel and drying his hair. Looking up with a 
small smile she watched him a moment before speaking, and realized how 
lucky she was to have him back safe and sound.

&quot;I love you.&quot; She said simply, her eyes glimmering. Zell paused and 
looked at her, genuinely touched.

&quot;Thanks, I really needed that.&quot; He said warmly. &quot;I love you too.&quot;

&quot;Let&#146;s run away from here.&quot; Nicole sighed.

&quot;Alright.&quot; Zell said without a second thought. &quot;I have some bags we can 
use.&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot; Nicole blurted. &quot;I wasn&#146;t serious.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure, I&#146;d leave in a moment if you wanted to.&quot; He said firmly.

Nicole blushed and shook her head fearfully.

&quot;We couldn&#146;t do that. I mean just up and leave everyone. I could, I&#146;m 
not important, but you, they need you here.&quot;

Zell laughed but it was bitter.

&quot;Fat lot of good I did.&quot; He grumbled.

&quot;You did your best, you all did. You stopped Griever that&#146;s what&#146;s 
important.&quot;

&quot;No, Edea stopped Griever, and now she&#146;s gone, again. He said sadly.

&quot;Come here.&quot; Nicole smiled opening her arms to him. With a heavy heart 
he plopped onto the bed and fell into her arms.

&quot;Why&#146;d she have to die, why&#146;d any of them have to die?&quot; He whispered.

&quot;I don&#146;t know love, I don&#146;t know. All we can do is try to move on, 
that&#146;s what they would want.&quot;

****************************

Cid sat alone in his dimly lit office, as classic music played echoed 
softly around the room. Scattered on his desk where several dozen old 
photos from a time long past. He in his youth alongside a raven hared 
women with piercing eyes and alabaster skin.

&quot;It&#146;s hard.&quot; He thought weakly with tears in his eyes. &quot;Already I&#146;m 
missing you. I try to be strong, I know it had to be this way, but I&#146;m 
weak. I need you here; I want you by my side. We never had the time 
together we should have had, and now its too late, my wife, my heart. 
You told me to be strong, to live on, to be there for the children. How 
can I, you were my reason for being, all I had was for you.

It was easier actually, when I thought you were lost irrevocably to that 
evil. To me, you were already gone I had put it behind me. But fate 
taunted me by bringing you back, only to slowly take you away again. I&#146;m 
thankful that we had this short time to share, but I wanted so much more 
for us, for you, to have a real family of our own, but now, now I&#146;ve 
nothing.&quot;

He looked at an ornate but functional antique pistol he kept on his 
desk.

&quot;I&#146;ve nothing.&quot; He whispered sadly.

There was a gentle knock on his door. Wiping his eyes gingerly he 
composed himself before speaking.

&quot;Yes?&quot; He said stiffly.

Xu poked her head in meekly. &quot;Sorry sir.&quot; She squeaked.

&quot;No, no it&#146;s okay come in.&quot; He ushered. &quot;It&#146;s awfully late, I thought 
you left for the evening.&quot;

Xu stepped into the office and looked around nervously.

&quot;I um made you some hot chocolate.&quot; She said quietly, setting the 
steaming cup carefully on his desk.

&quot;That was awfully kind of you child.&quot; Cid said warmly.

&quot;I just kinda, you know.&quot; She shrugged, fumbling on her thoughts and 
words. She looked down at the pictures thoughtfully.

&quot;You two seemed so happy then.&quot; She muttered.

&quot;We were, these were taken right after we got married, during our 
honeymoon.&quot; Cid commented absently as he examined the photos. He paused 
and picked on up to show her. It was of him as a teenager, he was 
dressed in clothes more befitting Zell and was adorned with a bushy 
goatee and large sideburns.

&quot;I was a paragon of fashion eh?&quot; He chuckled.

Xu couldn&#146;t help but smile and Cid grinned at her. &quot;Go ahead, laugh, 
it&#146;s funny.&quot; He smirked.

&quot;You were something else.&quot; Xu admitted with a smile then grew somber. 
&quot;Are you okay sir?&quot; She said tenderly. &quot;I know it&#146;s not really my place 
but if you want to talk or anything I&#146;d be happy to listen.&quot;

Cid was touched by the gesture but graciously declined.

&quot;I think I&#146;ll be okay.&quot; He sighed. &quot;I still have all of you.&quot; He said 
thoughtfully.

&quot;Always Sir.&quot; Xu smiled then hugged him tightly.

Cid was somewhat startled but soon realized it was something he sorely 
needed.

***************************

Fujin stood outside Quistis&#146; door, something she found herself doing a 
lot lately. This time she didn&#146;t knock, knowing full well that no one 
would answer. After the funeral Quistis had returned to her quarters and 
turned away Fujin&#146;s offer to stay with her. She was pleasantly surprised 
when the door opened and Quistis stumbled into her.

&quot;Oh!&quot; Quistis stammered and blushed. &quot;I um.. was coming to look for 
you.&quot; She said awkwardly while mussing with her hair.

&quot;FOUND ME.&quot; Fujin smiled lightly, taking note of Quistis&#146; obvious 
discomfort.

&quot;I...&quot; The both started.

&quot;GO.&quot; Fujin offered.

&quot;No, no, what were you going to say?&quot; Quistis countered.

&quot;NEGATIVE, YOU FIRST.&quot;

&quot;Okay, okay.&quot; Quistis sighed and looked down at her toes. &quot;I miss you.&quot; 
She said softly. &quot;I need you, I can&#146;t deal with this alone.&quot; She said 
softly, her eyes pleading. Fujin was unreadable and Quistis started to 
worry. &quot;I know I&#146;ve been horrible, I can&#146;t blame you if you hate me, I 
just hope you can somehow forgive me.&quot; She said shakily, her voice 
fading into a nervous whisper. Stuffing her hands in her pockets Fujin 
took a step forward to look up into the blue pools of Quistis&#146; eyes. 
Tilting her head slightly she regarded her intensely for a moment before 
stealing a light kiss.

Quistis stood in surprise as Fujin slipped past her and into the 
apartment. She shut the door and turned as Fujin sat down on the couch 
quietly.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry I ran you off earlier. I don&#146;t know what I&#146;m doing anymore, 
everything is a mess.&quot; Quistis sighed, sitting down heavily and burying 
her face in her hands.

&quot;NEED REST. PUSHING TO HARD.&quot; Fujin said sternly.

&quot;I can&#146;t sleep and when I do I keep having nightmares.&quot;

&quot;NATURAL.&quot;

&quot;I guess, but I don&#146;t see you falling apart.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;M NOT YOU.&quot; Fujin said candidly as she stood and headed to the 
kitchen.

&quot;What&#146;s that supposed to mean?&quot; Quistis frowned, not sure how to take 
the comment.

Fujin retrieved two cups from the cupboard and canister of herbal tea 
then looked over at Quistis who was waiting for an answer.

&quot;ALL REACT DIFFERENTLY.&quot; Fujin explained.

&quot;Yeah I know, basically what your saying is that I react by going to 
pieces.&quot; Quistis sighed sadly.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin responded simply as she began making the tea. &quot;YOUR 
POSITION, CIRCUMSTANCES.&quot; She said thoughtfully. &quot;FARE BETTER THAN 
MOST.&quot;

&quot;Somehow I don&#146;t believe you.&quot; Quistis mumbled as Fujin walked back out 
of the kitchen and handed her one of the cups. Quistis took it 
thankfully and the two sat quietly for a long while.

&quot;Aeka deserved so much better, so did Edea.&quot; Quistis finally whispered.

Fujin nodded but kept quiet.

&quot;Poor Cid. To loose someone that means so much. I don&#146;t know what I&#146;d do 
if anything ever happened to you. When you where missing...&quot; Quistis 
stammered shakily. Fujin put a calming hand on her hers, affectionately.

&quot;I love you Fujin, I don&#146;t ever want to loose you.&quot; Quistis murmured to 
her.

Fujin smiled softly but kept quiet, not wanting to ruin the moment with 
awkward attempts at speaking.

&quot;I&#146;ve been a real ass lately haven&#146;t I?&quot; Quistis continued.

Fujin shrugged slightly, seeing a certain wisdom in not voicing her 
agreement.

&quot;I notice you&#146;re not trying to say otherwise.&quot; Quistis smirked lightly. 
&quot;That&#146;s okay, you&#146;re right. I&#146;ve gotten so use to people depending on 
me. I don&#146;t know how to react when I let them down, and here lately that 
seems to be all that I&#146;m capable of. I know it&#146;s not my fault Aeka died, 
but I still feel responsible. How could I not? She was my student, I was 
supposed to protect her. Even Luccian, I should&#146;ve seen he was in 
trouble, perhaps I could&#146;ve done something.&quot; She sighed heavily and took 
a sip of her tea. Fujin was glad to have her talking about what she was 
going through for once.

&quot;I didn&#146;t want to fail you, like I did them.&quot; Quistis started again, her 
voice trembling nervously. &quot;So I pushed you away, I&#146;m sorry. I just hope 
things can be the same between us again.&quot;

Fujin quietly set her cup down and took Quistis&#146; from her. Moving 
delicately she took Quistis&#146; face in her hands and kissed her sweetly 
before wrapping her in a tight embrace.

**********************

&quot;Morning, and I wonder why I&#146;m forced to see another day. She died, for 
me and I find myself wondering why. Cid tells us she was dying already 
but that&#146;s not the point. She should&#146;ve held on to what she had left and 
not wasted it on one such as I. It was my time, my fate, my destiny to 
die. I had accepted it and I was ready. But now...&quot;

Seifer lay on his back, on the simple bed, in the simple room and in the 
simple clothes they had given him. If only life could be so... simple. 
Opening his eyes he gazed at the ceiling fan that spun lazily overhead.

&quot;Why for me, I&#146;m not worth it. She said she loved me like a son. Told me 
she would make things okay. She tricked me, used me, made me think I 
would have a noble death. Once again I&#146;ve been denied. I wonder why 
then, why am I not anger at her? Perhaps because I understand, I see 
what she wanted me to see. She told me to live, to be strong, to 
survive. She said I was her Knight. My romantic dream? Silly perhaps but 
its all I have, especially now. For her then, because she willed it. I 
will live, I will be strong and I will survive. I will make her proud of 
me, so when I see her again, mother, you will know that I was worthy.&quot;

Sitting up Seifer looked across the room to find Squall sitting nearby.

&quot;You missed the funeral.&quot; Squall said simply.

&quot;Keeping an eye on the madman are we?&quot; Seifer chuckled sarcastically.

&quot;No, just making sure you&#146;re alright. You were nearly catatonic when we 
brought you here.&quot;

&quot;Yeah well, I&#146;m fine. You can quit playing hero. I told you I don&#146;t need 
you pity.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t flatter yourself. I&#146;m only here because Cid asked me to come. It 
seems Edea wanted us to try to work things out and move on.&quot; Squall said 
in a quiet but deliberate tone.

&quot;She wants us to play nice huh. Forgive and forget everything I did eh?&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s what she says, she blames herself for how you turned out, asked 
us to give you another chance. She left a video will if you want to see 
for yourself.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t bother I know what needs to be done.&quot;

&quot;Oh and what&#146;s that?&quot;

&quot;We both know I can&#146;t stay here, there&#146;s to much bad blood.&quot;

&quot;Fujin stayed, she&#146;s getting along quite well.&quot;

Seifer snorted. &quot;Yeah, I know how well she&#146;s getting along.&quot;

&quot;What&#146;s that supposed to mean?&quot;

&quot;Never mind where&#146;s my things?&quot; Seifer grunted as he got up.

Squall thumbed over to where Seifer&#146;s well used Gunblade lay next to a 
duffel bag.

&quot;It should have been me.&quot; Seifer sighed.

&quot;What do you want me to say?&quot; Squall frowned.

&quot;You all said enough, look I&#146;ll be out of you hair as soon as you drop 
me off somewhere.&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#146;t have to be that way.&quot;

&quot;No?&quot; Seifer laughed bitterly.

&quot;Take some time, think things out. We&#146;re not kicking you out. Though I&#146;m 
not going to lie to you. There are plenty here that want you gone or 
worse. All I&#146;m saying is you&#146;re welcome to take some time and sort 
yourself out before making any kind of decision.&quot; Squall said with a 
certain blas&eacute; quality he was notorious for. Seifer sat back down.

&quot;Get out of here.&quot; He huffed.

&quot;I am, but just think hard about what you&#146;re going to do. Don&#146;t make 
Edea&#146;s sacrifice be in vain.&quot; Squall said as he made his way to the 
door. Seifer wasn&#146;t listening, his mind already awash with thoughts of 
the future.

*******************

The class was empty, the students still having a few days off to try to 
get back to normal. Quistis sat at her desk, her hair tussled and her 
brow furrowed as she tried to focus on judging the final scores. It 
seemed all so trivial now, but she knew that was depression talking, 
thanks to Fujin. It was she, who forced her out of the apartment, nearly 
at knifepoint as soon as they woke up.

&quot;GO WORK!&quot; She had growled before locking her out of her own apartment.

Quistis sighed and leaned back in her chair trying to focus. Hanging her 
head back lazily she looked upside down at the blackboard in thought.

&quot;This is how you spend you mornings?&quot; An unwelcome voice said 
sarcastically.

Quistis slowly raised up and her eyes locked on Seifer who was kicked 
back in the same seat he used to occupy years ago.

&quot;Seifer.&quot; She said in cordial if not caustic manner.

&quot;Instructor.&quot; He replied with the same courtesy.

&quot;How&#146;s things?&quot;

&quot;Why do you ask?&quot;

&quot;Just curious, it&#146;s been awhile.&quot;

Quistis bristled, she never liked the mind games he played and her 
present state of mind gave her even less patience for them.

&quot;What do you want?&quot; She said venomously.

&quot;Snappy today, I can understand that.&quot; Seifer smirked glancing around in 
reminiscence.

&quot;If you have nothing important to say then get out.&quot;

&quot;You haven&#146;t changed at all.&quot; He smiled.

&quot;Get out.&quot;

&quot;I wonder what she sees in you.&quot;

&quot;OUT!&quot;

&quot;You are a good kisser, perhaps that&#146;s it.&quot; He chuckled and stood.

Quistis was incensed and nearly jumped from her seat.

&quot;Calm down I&#146;m just trying to lighten the mood.&quot; Seifer waved as Quistis 
steamed in her seat.

&quot;I need some advice.&quot; He asked candidly.

&quot;Got to hell.&quot; She offered bluntly.

&quot; I tried, remember, but was denied.&quot; He snapped back coolly.

&quot;Why me, you know as well as I do that I&#146;m the last person to be giving 
advice on anything.&quot; She grumbled angrily.

&quot;That&#146;s utter self serving bullshit and you know it.&quot; He laughed.

&quot;What do you want with me, I&#146;m tired and I&#146;m in no mood for this.&quot;

&quot;Simple question. What should I do?&quot;

&quot;I think to go to hell was my previous answer.&quot; Quistis quipped.

&quot;Cute.&quot; Seifer sneered. &quot;Are you going to help me or not?&quot; He frowned.

&quot;Why should I help you?&quot;

&quot;Because you were my teacher, it&#146;s your job.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re mocking me.&quot;

&quot;I would never.&quot;

&quot;Liar.&quot;

&quot;Okay I would, but not this time.&quot; He grinned.

&quot;Can we quit the dancing please, I&#146;m not amused and you&#146;re really 
pressing it.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m being serious.&quot; Seifer said defensively, this time there was no 
smile.

Quistis stared at him for a long moment then sat back in her seat.

&quot;What happened now?&quot; She asked finally.

&quot;It&#146;s my understanding Squall thinks to rehabilitate me, make me one of 
you again.&quot;

&quot;And what gave him that idea.&quot; Quistis droned.

&quot;Edea.&quot; Seifer frowned.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Quistis said quietly. &quot;I get it now.&quot; She sighed, steepling her 
fingers.

&quot;Do you want to stay?&quot; She asked.

&quot;There&#146;s nothing here for me, you know that.&quot;

&quot;Yes I do, everyone hates you.&quot; She said bluntly.

&quot;That&#146;s what I always liked about you. You never sugarcoat anything.&quot; He 
chuckled.

&quot;If you looking for absolution, you&#146;re never going to find it. But you 
can try to repair some of the damage you&#146;ve done.&quot; She said quietly as 
she started going over her paperwork again.

&quot;You have an idea then.&quot; Seifer said almost eagerly.

&quot;Perhaps, but that&#146;s only if they&#146;ll have you.&quot;

&quot;Trabia.&quot; Seifer frowned.

&quot;It&#146;s a start, they&#146;re having a hard time rebuilding there.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;d be going to my death.&quot;

&quot;I thought that was your goal, regardless, none of them knows what you 
look like. Cid had the files sealed. At the time, we thought you where 
under the influence of Ultimecia. Perhaps we should release them. I 
suppose you&#146;d spend the rest of you life on the run. But that would do 
no one any good would it.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s insane.&quot;

&quot;You the one moaning about making amends, what better place to start 
than with the innocents you attacked.&quot;

Seifer was humbled and his expression showed it.

&quot;Now if you will excuse me I have to get back to work.&quot; She said 
absently and waved him away. With a quiet nod Seifer did as she asked 
and left the room. After he was gone Quistis looked to the door and 
frowned. As much as she hated to admit it, she nearly felt sorry for 
him. With a sigh, she shook her head and went back to work.

********************************

House cleaning was something Fujin never had trouble with. Her quarters 
where sparse to say the least, hence her dilemma as she stood gawking in 
near horror at the mess Quistis&#146; apartment had become over the last 
week. Melancholy and frantic schedules had left everything scattered to 
the four winds. Her plan had been to get Quistis out and about long 
enough to get things cleaned up as a surprise. It wasn&#146;t much but she 
hoped it would brighten her spirits a little. But the laundry alone was 
a daunting task in and of itself.

It came as a startling surprise when Fujin realized she had no idea how 
to properly wash many of Quistis&#146; expensive and trendy outfits made of 
materials half of which she never heard of. With apron tied neatly 
around her waist and her hair tied up into an improvised topknot, she 
was growing worried she would not have her task completed in time. A 
knock on the door caused her to frown.

She crept quietly to the door and peered through the peephole. Xu&#146;s 
tired face greeted her. The young woman looked liked she&#146;d been up all 
night. She knocked again and Fujin contemplated ignoring it but changed 
her mind, it could be important. Tentatively she opened the door and 
poked her head out.

&quot;What the hell are you doing? Xu asked, raising a curious brow. &quot;And 
take your hair down, your creeping me out.&quot;

&quot;SHUT UP.&quot; Fujin scowled.

&quot;Are you the lady of the house?&quot; Xu smirked as she got a better view of 
the various cleaning garments, complete with rubber gloves.

Fujin wasn&#146;t amused and moved to shut the door in her face. Quick to 
react Xu stuck her foot in the door.

&quot;Sorry, sorry. You&#146;re so sensitive.&quot; She frowned and pushed her way 
inside.

&quot;Where&#146;s Quistis?&quot;

&quot;CLASS.&quot; Fujin said with a huff.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Xu blinked in surprise.

Fujin nodded and went back to the pile of clothes.

&quot;I&#146;m glad she got out and about. I was worried about her.&quot;

&quot;SHE&#146;S OKAY.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s good, I take it you guys made up?&quot; Xu asked absently as she 
poked through the clothing curiously.

Fujin nodded, still not accustomed about talking about such things.

&quot;Why are you doing her laundry?&quot;

&quot;A SURPRISE.&quot; Fujin said simply

&quot;That&#146;s sweet.&quot; Xu cooed.

&quot;HERE, WHY?&quot; Fujin asked dully.

&quot;I just wanted to give her the results from the other teachers tests.&quot; 
Xu said faintly as she watched Fujin toss a black gown into a pile dark 
clothes.

&quot;Umm.&quot; Xu mumbled.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin sighed in annoyance.

&quot;You&#146;re not washing that Gown with those shirts are you?&quot;

Fujin cut her a wary look.

&quot;I mean, being silk, you just don&#146;t toss it in like it was t shirt. Oh 
and that blouse is dry clean only.&quot; Xu pointed out as she poked through 
another pile.

Fujin bristled but kept quiet. As much as she hated to admit it, she had 
little idea what to do.

&quot;I take it you don&#146;t dress up much.&quot; Xu mumbled, then blanched. &quot;Um, no 
offense.&quot;

Fujin folded her arms and frowned, her face growing slightly red with 
embarrassment. Xu slipped her coat off and rolled up her sleeves.

&quot;Here let me help you out.&quot; She smiled as she started sorting back 
through the garments. &quot;See.&quot; She said, holding up a skirt. &quot;Some of 
these that don&#146;t have labels can be a hassle if you don&#146;t know what 
they&#146;re made of.&quot;

Fujin listened, somewhat humbly as Xu explained the various differences 
and proper care of some of the more exotic fabrics. They had made their 
way to a stack of undergarments and Xu held up a rather racy yet 
tasteful, black lace corset.

&quot;Oh this is lovely.&quot; She commented, looking it over. &quot;I wonder where she 
got it?&quot;

&quot;Do I even want to know why you two are going through my underwear?&quot; 
Quistis said with a slightly fearful tone. Xu and Fujin both jumped and 
spun around like children caught doing mischief. Setting her bag down, 
Quistis walked over to them and looked at the pile of laundry curiously.

&quot;SURPRISE!&quot; Fujin offered lamely, causing Xu to hang her head in misery.

Quistis rolled her eyes and deftly undid the topknot Fujin&#146;s hair was 
tied in, and shook her head while giving her a shrewd look.

&quot;It was her idea!&quot; Xu blurted, handing the documents she brought to 
Quistis then leaving posthaste. Quistis watched her go then glanced at 
the papers a moment before setting them down. Fujin was flush with 
embarrassment as she folded a shirt absently. Quistis looked around and 
smirked cattily.

&quot;You&#146;ve cleaned up.&quot;

&quot;LAUNDRY.&quot; Fujin mumbled, having the need to explain what she&#146;d been 
doing.

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis asked, savoring her awkwardness.

Fujin held up the shirt she was toying with awkwardly.

&quot;DOING LAUNDRY.&quot; She mumbled again.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Quistis chuckled, letting her off the hook with a smile.

&quot;XU ASSISTING.&quot; Fujin explained, still feeling foolish.

&quot;It&#146;s okay, really. Thank you that was too kind of you.&quot; Quistis 
giggled, kissing her forehead. Fujin pouted slightly, she hated being 
made fun of but somehow she couldn&#146;t bring herself to be mad. She was 
just thankful to hear Quistis laugh for the first time in a long while.

&quot;HOME EARLY?&quot;

&quot;I finished my work.&quot; Quistis sighed as she undid the top buttons on her 
blouse and kicked of her shoes. She started to walk to the kitchen and 
noticed Fujin still standing by the clothes. Walking back over to her 
she took hands in hers and smiled gently.

&quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;FOR WHAT?&quot; Fujin blinked, looking up at her curiously.

&quot;Everything, staying with me last night. I really needed you with me, 
even if I didn&#146;t realize it. You&#146;ve done your best to take care of me, 
even after all the hassle I put you through.&quot; Quistis whispered.

Fujin blushed and looked down shyly.

&quot;To cute.&quot; Quistis murmured causing Fujin to swat at her playfully. &quot;I&#146;m 
going to go change, then I have to go talk to Selphie about the 
graduation ceremony. You want to come with me?&quot;

Fujin looked thoughtfully a moment then nodded.

&quot;Okies, I&#146;ll be just a minute.&quot; Quistis said as she headed to her room.

&quot;Are you going?&quot; She asked as she changed into something more relaxing.

&quot;YES.&quot; Fujin called out, having thought she answered the question 
already.

&quot;I mean, to graduation.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

Quistis stuck her head out of the bedroom.

&quot;What, you don&#146;t think you made it?&quot;

&quot;REGARDLESS.&quot; Fujin shrugged.

&quot;Don&#146;t be that way, heck, even Squall went.&quot;

&quot;NOT SQUALL.&quot;

&quot;Okay, okay.&quot; Quistis relented quickly, not wanting to spoil her good 
mood. She walked out and tied back her hair. &quot;Ready.&quot;

After they left and headed up the hall, Quistis grew oddly grave as they 
approached Selphie&#146;s quarters. Fujin looked at her worriedly and caused 
her to pause.

&quot;PROBLEM?&quot;

Quistis frowned slightly. &quot;I ran into Seifer.&quot;

Fujin made a face.

&quot;It&#146;s okay, he asked me for advice.&quot;

&quot;ADVICE?&quot;

&quot;Yes, he still think he can make amends somehow. I think he needs to go 
to prison personally. Anyway, Edea wanted us to try and give him another 
chance.&quot;

&quot;AND?&quot;

&quot;From what I can tell Cid and Squall are kind of torn about it. I told 
him if he really wanted to try and make amends he needs to go to the 
people he hurt the worst.&quot;

&quot;TRABIA.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s all I could come up with of. I don&#146;t know what I was thinking.&quot;

&quot;SELPHIE.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#146;t going to like the idea.&quot;

&quot;UNDERSTATEMENT.&quot;

The door to Selphie&#146;s apartment opened and small women came out and 
folded her arms. Fujin and Quistis looked at her in surprise.

&quot;How&#146;d you know we where out here?&quot; Quistis stammered.

&quot;I&#146;ve excellent hearing and I heard your big mouthed friend say my 
name.&quot; Selphie explained candidly.

Quistis and Fujin exchanged awkward glances. Quistis was even more put 
off when Selphie ran up and hugged her.

&quot;Quisty!&quot;

&quot;Um hello.&quot; Quistis mumbled looking at Fujin helplessly.

&quot;I&#146;m glad to see you, I was worried about you.&quot; Selphie squeaked.

&quot;I&#146;ll be fine, honest. I just need time to recuperate.&quot;

&quot;Better be.&quot; Selphie pouted. &quot;So then.&quot; She said abruptly and looked at 
Fujin accusingly. &quot;What about me?&quot;

Fujin promptly pointed at Quistis, bringing the girls attention to bear 
on the blonde instructor once more.

&quot;Graduation.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;Oh okay.&quot; Selphie nodded knowingly.

&quot;I just wanted to make sure you knew we postponed it until the week 
after next. I&#146;m sorry, I know you already made the preparations for this 
weekend.&quot; Quistis said apologetically.

&quot;Xu told me. I already called the caterers and such. I&#146;m glad you did, 
nobody is up to it right now.&quot; Selphie said sadly then brightened 
slightly. &quot;We&#146;re all going up on the roof tonight, it&#146;s been awhile 
since we all got together. I hope you&#146;ll be there. Fujin, you&#146;re invited 
to.&quot;

Fujin folded her arms with disinterested but Quistis knew better.

&quot;I&#146;ll be there.&quot; Quistis nodded then looked back at Fujin and arched her 
brows expectantly.

&quot;NOTHING ELSE TO DO.&quot; Fujin grumbled.

&quot;Cool, glad to hear it.&quot; Selphie smiled as Irvine shuffled out the door, 
looking half-asleep.

&quot;Why is everyone in the hall?&quot; He mumbled.

&quot;Hey hon, sleep well?&quot; Selphie smiled.

&quot;I guess. Hey Quisty, nice to see you.&quot; Irvine yawned hugely.

&quot;Up late?&quot; Quistis chuckled.

&quot;He thought he&#146;d be slick and sneak out to smoke while I was asleep.&quot; 
Selphie said smartly. Irvine bristled slightly and groaned.

Fujin smirked as he squirmed under everyone&#146;s scrutiny.

&quot;I um.&quot; He babbled, knowing in advance that any argument in he own 
defense would be hopeless.

&quot;Whatever.&quot; Selphie said rolling her eyes. &quot;With the baby coming too, 
he&#146;s so inconsiderate. I told him I better not catch him smoking in the 
apartment.&quot;

Quistis just nodded while Fujin started looking around absently as 
Selphie worked herself into a rant.

&quot;Seifer came to me for advice.&quot; Quistis blurted, seeing no other way to 
tell her than to just spit it out.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Selphie paused in mid tirade. Irvine took the opportunity to 
scurry back inside as Quistis decided how to continue.

&quot;He claims to wants to help repair the damage he&#146;s caused.&quot;

&quot;Pardon me?&quot; Selphie frowned, tilting her head.

&quot;Apparently Edea wanted us to go lenient on him. I suggested he go to 
Trabia.&quot; Quistis sighed. &quot;I figure he could try to find his absolution 
there.&quot;

Selphie groaned and shook her head vigorously as if trying to shake out 
a bad thought.

&quot;Bad idea Quisty, bad, bad idea.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s all I could come up with. Well beside rotting in a prison some 
where.&quot;

Fujin grumbled under her breath causing Quistis to glance at her 
momentarily.

&quot;Oh I don&#146;t even want to hear this.&quot; Selphie scowled then softened. &quot;You 
know what!&quot; She said almost cheerfully. &quot;I don&#146;t care, I don&#146;t even 
care. He can do what the hell he wants so long as I don&#146;t see him ever 
again.&quot; She stated firmly then put her hands on her hips.

&quot;Um okay.&quot; Quistis blinked.

&quot;I&#146;m serious, I&#146;ve a baby coming. I don&#146;t need this kind of stress. If 
Cid and Squall thinks Seifer can run around loose then it&#146;s on them if 
anything happens.&quot; She proclaimed, waving her hand empirically.

Quistis rubbed her temples and nodded.

&quot;Tonight, right?&quot; She asked quietly, having a great desire to change the 
subject. Selphie calmed down and took a breath.

&quot;What?&quot; She asked.

&quot;This little get together? It&#146;s tonight correct.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s the plan.&quot; Selphie nodded.

&quot;Good, I&#146;ll see you tonight.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re leaving? I&#146;m sorry I got worked up.&quot; Selphie said sulky.

&quot;It&#146;s not you hon, I&#146;m still a tired, that&#146;s all.&quot; Quistis assured her.

&quot;If you say so.&quot; Selphie pouted.

&quot;It&#146;s okay, you&#146;re right about Seifer. We won&#146;t talk about him again, 
how&#146;s that?&quot;

&quot;Kay.&quot;

&quot;Okay then, I&#146;ll see you guys tonight.&quot; Quistis smiled, before heading 
back to Fujin. Selphie turned and went back inside, still somewhat 
troubled over what was going on but content to let sleeping dogs lie for 
now. Fujin gave Quistis a look of concern as they walked up the hall.

&quot;OKAY?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I&#146;m fine. Lets go get something to eat.&quot; Quistis nodded as they 
made their way to the cafeteria.

**********

&quot;Hey stud.&quot; Celest said jokingly.

Zell looked up from where he was repairing damaged sections of the 
Ragnarok&#146;s hull.

&quot;Hey.&quot; He said quietly. &quot;What brings you down here?&quot;

&quot;Bored, mostly. Just looking for someone to talk to.&quot;

&quot;Where&#146;s Irvine?&quot;

&quot;Oh he&#146;s spending time with Selphie I think. I&#146;ll see him tonight most 
likely. By the way, are you going?&quot;

&quot;Yeah I&#146;ll be there, It&#146;ll be good to hang out with some friends for 
awhile.&quot;

Celest nodded quietly.

&quot;Something on your mind?&quot; Zell asked.

&quot;Nah, I&#146;m okay. How about you?&quot;

&quot;Depressed, to be honest.&quot; He frowned, setting down his arc welder. 
&quot;That, and well Nicole said something to me I&#146;ve been thinking about.&quot;

&quot;What&#146;s that?&quot;

&quot;She asked me to leave with her.&quot;

&quot;Leave, what SEED or the garden altogether?&quot;

&quot;All together, just go start a new life somewhere.&quot; He said in a quiet 
thoughtful tone.

&quot;Oh sugar, that&#146;s a big decision. What did you say?&quot; She gasped in 
surprise.

&quot;I told her yes, but she said she was just joking, but...&quot;

&quot;You think she was serious?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Where you?&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t know, this place is like a second home to me. You guys are all 
like family. But if Nicole asked, I&#146;d go in a heartbeat.&quot;

&quot;Wow, I wish I had someone who cared for me like that.&quot; Nicole sighed 
wistfully.

&quot;You try to hard.&quot; Zell chuckled.

&quot;Gee thanks.&quot;

&quot;Seriously.&quot;

&quot;Gee thanks.&quot; Celest said again, this time obviously insulted.

&quot;No, no hear me out. Look, I mean you doll yourself up, wear those tight 
clothes. Let&#146;s be honest, you&#146;re a little curvy to be dressing the way 
you do sometimes.&quot; Zell mumbled, scratching his head and blushing.

&quot;You&#146;re saying I&#146;m fat!&quot; Celest gawked. Zell quickly waved his hands.

&quot;No, no, no, you&#146;re not listening. Look, you&#146;re gorgeous, that combined 
with the way you act.&quot; Zell winced.

&quot;What about the way I act.&quot; She huffed.

&quot;You&#146;re um, aggressive.&quot;

&quot;Aggressive!?&quot;

&quot;Er, flirty.&quot;

&quot;A tramp!?&quot;

&quot;NO!&quot;

&quot;What then!?&quot;

&quot;Listen.&quot; He moaned, banging his head lightly against the leg of the 
Ragnarok.

&quot;You&#146;re intimidating.&quot;

&quot;Say what?&quot;

&quot;You, um kinda, ya know.&quot;

&quot;No, I don&#146;t know. How about you tell me.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m sure Irvine has said all this before. Let&#146;s just forget it.&quot;

&quot;Are you flirting with me?&quot;

&quot;WHAT!?&quot; Zell blurted. &quot;NO!&quot; He paused a moment and shook his head. 
&quot;Gods no.&quot; He added to reaffirm his statement while blushing brightly.

&quot;Well you said that quick. You, DO, think I&#146;m fat.&quot;

&quot;Oh kill me now.&quot; Zell groaned.

&quot;So let me get this straight now.&quot; Celest snapped, putting a hand on her 
hip as she counted off his offenses. &quot;You said I&#146;m a fat, intimidating, 
poorly dressed tramp.&quot;

Zell grabbed his head and looked as though he where about to scream.

&quot;I didn&#146;t say that! Well, not all of it.&quot; He cried, nearly in a fit of 
desperation.

Celest folded her arms and smirked.

&quot;Got you.&quot; She chuckled.

&quot;Huh.&quot; Zell said stupidly.

&quot;Calm down sugar, I&#146;m just pulling your leg. I know what you meant. I&#146;m 
just trying to get you riled.&quot;

Zell scowled and threw a dirty oil rag at her.

&quot;Oh you&#146;re, you&#146;re, sick.&quot; He chuckled as she laughed giddily at him.

&quot;I know, I&#146;m a devil.&quot; She winked then leaned back against a support 
beam with a sigh. &quot;I guess you&#146;re right.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m always right.&quot; He smirked.

&quot;Un huh.&quot; Celest said candidly.

&quot;Thanks for the laugh. I needed it.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, we all do.&quot; Celest groaned as she stretched her arms over her 
head lazily. &quot;Ugh, I&#146;m getting old, I&#146;m going to be an old maid.&quot;

&quot;Oh please, don&#146;t start up again, I&#146;m not buying it.&quot;

&quot;Nah, I think I pulled something during the fighting.&quot;

&quot;Go see the doc.&quot;

&quot;She&#146;s been busy with the others, I&#146;ll go later if it doesn&#146;t clear up.&quot;

&quot;Try a curga.&quot;

&quot;They don&#146;t do to well against plain old aches and pains, besides that&#146;d 
be a waste. I&#146;ll be fine.&quot;

Zell shrugged and went back to work. Celest moved closer and leaned over 
his shoulder.

&quot;Need a hand? I&#146;ve got nothing better to do.&quot; She offered.

&quot;Sure, you know anything about welding?&quot;

&quot;Um no.&quot;

&quot;Wiring?&quot;

&quot;Nadda.&quot;

&quot;Hmm... Painting?&quot;

&quot;Watercolors.&quot;

&quot;Um, little more than that.&quot; Zell winced.

&quot;Tell you what, I&#146;ll just sit here and pester you while you work.&quot; She 
smiled and took a seat atop the Ragnarok&#146;s talon.

&quot;Alright then.&quot; Zell laughed lightly as he went back to work.

********************

Quistis had just parted ways with Fujin after their lunch was heading 
back to apartment when Irvine caught up with her.

&quot;Quistis.&quot; He called to her causing her to pause just outside her door.

&quot;Irvine.&quot; She said cordially.

&quot;Um can I talk to you for a moment?&quot; He said nervously. &quot;Inside.&quot;

Looking at him dubiously Quistis opened the door and motioned him 
inside. She slipped out of her shoes then sat down on the couch as 
Irvine looked around awkwardly.

&quot;Anyone here?&quot; He asked with obvious caution.

&quot;Just us, what&#146;s wrong?&quot; Quistis frowned; praying that another disaster 
wasn&#146;t about to descend.

&quot;I need you&#146;re help. Well, advice actually.&quot; He said quietly, removing 
his hat.

&quot;Are you in trouble?&quot; She frowned, crossing her legs.

&quot;No, it&#146;s nothing like that.&quot;

&quot;Well what is it, just spit it out.&quot;
