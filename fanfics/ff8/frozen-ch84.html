Seifer ran up the halls in a frenzied hurry, Xu had been on the intercom 
calling for security teams to the clinic and he knew it could only mean 
trouble. Zell intercepted him along the way and called out to him as 
they ran.

&quot;What&#39;s going!&quot; Zell asked.

&quot;Dunno... but it I have an idea...&quot; Seifer said grimly.

When they arrived at the clinic Kadowaki stood outside talking to 
several security teams.

&quot;Yo doc, what&#39;s going on!?&quot; Zell asked, pushing through the crowd.

&quot;Zell, thank Hyne, someone with some sense.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s a first.&quot; Seifer smirked, but was largely ignored.

&quot;It&#39;s Fujin and Ellone...&quot; The doctor gasped as if out of breath.

&quot;Fujin...!&quot; Seifer blurted growing pale. Celest and Raijin joined the 
growing crowd, as did Nicole.

&quot;Zell, damn it...&quot; Kadowaki groaned in dismay. &quot;They did it...I came in 
this morning, I went into check on Quistis and they were there...&quot;

&quot;And!?&quot; Seifer blurted growing impatient.

&quot;They&#39;re in some kind of trance, and there is ice everywhere!&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot; Zell gawked, pushing past her into the clinic, followed by 
Seifer and Raijin. A surge of people moved forward to investigate also 
but was cut off by Celest who moved in front of the clinic doors with a 
downright vicious look in her eyes.

Inside, Zell, Seifer and Raijin crept towards the door leading into 
Quistis and Fujin&#39;s room. Kadowaki moved beside them and frowned.

&quot;I was going to try and snap them out of it, but I didn&#39;t want to risk 
harming them.

&quot;Good plan doc.&quot; Zell nodded as he cautiously opened the door. Sure 
enough, a thin sheet of Ice coated the floors and ceiling and the air 
was chill.

&quot;What the hell.&quot; Seifer blinked.

&quot;It has to be Shiva.&quot; Zell frowned as he looked over the three women. 
Ellone seemed well enough, albeit in a deep trance. Fujin however looked 
haggard, despite the chill temperatures she was sweating profusely and 
her left arm looked grotesquely bruised and gray. Her features where 
knotted as if concentrating intensely. Quistis too was sweating but her 
expression was as still as ever.

&quot;Um, I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on here, but even I know it ain&#39;t good.&quot; 
Raijin mumbled.

&quot;That&#146;s it, we wake em up!&quot; Seifer snorted, grabbing Fujin by the arm.

*******************

Shiva screamed like a hell bent banshee, breathing forth a monstrous 
torrent of freezing air. Fujin ran madly in a wide circle just ahead of 
the stream as Shiva slowly turned to follow her. The scenery had 
changed, this time Fujin found herself running through the shattered 
mixture of Balamb&#39;s halls and the sewers of what she assumed where 
Deling city. Ducking behind a broken wall of brick she narrowly avoid 
the chill blast. The icy blast flash froze the masonry and it shattered 
like so much glass.

&quot;How are you doing?&quot; Ellone asked worriedly.

&quot;Fine!&quot; Fujin snapped irritably as her cover fell apart. Shiva&#39;s eyes 
narrowed and she staggered forward crazily with arms outstretched.

&quot;Damn it...&quot; Fujin grimaced as the insane guardian&#39;s hands began 
frosting over. She barely had time to react as an avalanche of ice shot 
across the ground towards her. Turning around, Fujin scrambled wildly to 
get out of the way but failed. The ice blasted around her burying her 
waist deep in ice.

She screamed in pain from the shocking cold and crushing weight. She was 
only vaguely aware of someone grabbing her arm and a voice screamed in 
her head rattling her already shaky concentration. Her form shimmered 
and she began to fade. Luckily the distraction saved her because it made 
her incorporeal as an icy lance blasted through her skull. The attack 
occurred with such speed that she barely had time to register it. All 
she knew was that she had a brief reprieve and was going to use it. 
Mentally thanking Ellone for what ever she did, she used her temporary 
insubstantiality to pull free of the ice and charge the bewildered 
Guardian. With a scream of rage she leapt to tackle Shiva who was 
hastily waving her arms. A wall of ice sprung up from the ground between 
them and Fujin passed clean through it as well as Shiva. Landing 
haphazardly, Fujin rolled to her feet and scowled.

&quot;Ellone, stop it!&quot; She screamed, again feeling the odd sensation of 
someone shaking her.

&quot;It&#39;s not me...&quot; Ellone said, her voice shaky

Fujin grunted angrily as she once again heard a strange voice in her 
head. Ignoring it, she closed her eyes and tried to refocus her 
thoughts. Shiva looked about in confusion then turned to find her foe 
standing behind her seemingly asleep.

Babbling in an incoherent rage the Shiva slashed wildly at Fujin, only 
to pass through her. After a moment of futile attacks Shiva stiffened 
and snarled curiously. Leaning forward she peered curiously into Fujin&#39;s 
blank features.

&quot;HA!&quot; Fujin blurted savagely, opening her eyes. Shiva&#39;s blank eyes grew 
wide with anger then shock as Fujin slammed her chakram hard into the 
guardian&#39;s stomach neatly eviscerating her. Fujin stepped back grimly as 
steaming entrails fell heavily onto the frozen ground at her feet.

Shiva let out an unearthly scream of pain and outrage. Lunging forward 
with startling speed, she gripped Fujin&#39;s head with both hands. This 
time it was Fujin&#39;s turn to scream as she felt Shiva preparing to flash 
freeze her brains. Bringing her knee up, she struck the guardian hard in 
the gaping wound she&#39;d caused. Shiva&#39;s grip weakened from the shock of 
the blow and Fujin spun free. Completing the spin, she delivered a 
backhand swing with her chakram and decapitated the guardian.

Shiva&#39;s body began to fade into a wispy mist and Fujin, as she did with 
Leviathan, willed it to join with her.

The battles complete, Fujin then collapsed exhausted. Ellone appeared 
before her and helped her stand while beaming brightly.

&quot;You did it!&quot; She shouted happily.

&quot;We...&quot; Fujin nodded weakly.

&quot;Oh I was just a bystander, you did all the work!&quot;

&quot;You helped free me from the ice.&quot; Fujin noted.

&quot;Wasn&#39;t me.&quot; Ellone grinned as the battered, broken landscape faded once 
more into a barren, flat wasteland.

&quot;Who then?&quot;

&quot;I think someone tried to wake you up...chances are we&#39;ve been found 
out.&quot;

&quot;Foolish!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, foolish or no, they saved your life I think...&quot; Ellone 
winked, then asked curiously. &quot;So now what?&quot;

&quot;Unknown...&quot; Fujin whispered, things looked as bleak as always, but 
there was a tangible peace in the air.

&quot;How long does this memory loss usually last when guardians are used?

&quot;Varies...&quot; Fujin said absently, glancing about in hope of seeing 
something positive.

&quot;Well, perhaps it&#39;s just going to take time, surely we&#39;ve made the 
situation better by yanking them nasty buggers out of her.&quot; Ellone 
smiled, trying to be optimistic.

&quot;Yes, perhaps.&quot; Fujin mumbled.

&quot;How very odd.&quot; A familiar, yet strange voice sounded behind Fujin 
causing her to jump.

&quot;Oh my!&quot; Ellone blinked, stunned.

Another apparition had appeared and it took Fujin a moment to realize 
that it wore her own face. Ellone realized it too after a moment and 
looked between the two Fujins curiously. While it the two did indeed 
look like alike, something about the spirit Fujin seemed far more 
tranquil and delicate in a shy way. Coming to terms with what she faced, 
Fujin realized that the ghostly form was a side of herself she only 
shared with Quistis. Still though, the phantom was like the one of Aeka 
and Luccian, having star filled eyes a colorless form. It also spoke 
with a mix of Quistis&#39; voice as well as her own.

Fujin stammered awkwardly, unsure what to do.

&quot;Precious, if you could see the look on your face.&quot; The phantom giggled 
brightly. Ellone bristled, it was kind of eerie seeing the normally 
stoic Fujin teeter so, even if it wasn&#39;t really her, or was it, the 
whole thing was kind of confusing. Fujin made a face at the sight and 
blushed.

&quot;Another fragment of Quistis&#39; mind perhaps?&quot; Ellone finally mumbled, 
looking to Fujin for answers. Fujin had an idea of what was going on but 
kept it to herself.

&quot;I miss you.&quot; The ghost smiled warmly, moving towards her.

Ellone looked about awkwardly.

&quot;I...&quot; Fujin mouthed, uneasily. &quot;Quistis...?&quot;

&quot;I um... I think it&#146;s a representation of her...love, her affection, 
what, who... she loves...&quot; Ellone surmised quietly.

&quot;I know that...&quot; Fujin winced, cutting her a dry look.

&quot;Oh, um...I&#39;ll be...going...um somewhere.&quot; Ellone stammered, fading from 
view.

Fujin took a breath and sighed, looking at the wispy figure before her. 
It was strange, seeing how someone else sees you. It was oddly 
flattering in a strange way. She couldn&#39;t help but smile, somehow the 
spirit seemed far prettier than she ever thought she was.

&quot;I never gave up...&quot; She whispered.

&quot;I know...&quot; The phantom smiled, touching her cheek.

&quot;Come back to me... I need you.&quot; Fujin sniffed quietly.

&quot;Beautiful...&quot; The phantom replied dreamily then grew solemn.

&quot;What is it!?&quot; Fujin frowned worriedly as the horizon darkened.

&quot;I love you...!&quot; The phantom said with a tinge of fear in its voice. 
Quickly it drew Fujin into its arms and kissed her sweetly on the lips 
as the shadows overtook them.

*****************

&quot;Seifer dude wait!&quot; Zell shouted, pulling him off Fujin. &quot;You could kill 
them!&quot;

&quot;Look at her, she&#39;s dying already!&quot; Seifer snapped, shaking her once 
more. &quot;Fujin! Wake up, wake up damn it!&quot;

&quot;Stop it!&quot; Raijin shouted, grabbing Seifer and hoisting him away.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Kadowaki yelled, moving to break them up. Quistis coughed once 
then began to spasm violently.

&quot;Damn it!&quot; The doctor cursed, moving to her side as Ellone stiffened and 
opened her eyes looking around wide-eyed!

&quot;She&#39;s dying!&quot; She screamed.

&quot;No!&quot; Zell cried out in dismay.

&quot;All of you out of here right now!&quot; Kadowaki ordered.

&quot;Fujin!&quot; Seifer yelled.

&quot;Doc K will take care of em, but we gotta get about of the way ya know!&quot; 
Raijin said gruffly, hauling him away.

Zell pulled the shut and looked gravely at the crowd of people standing 
in the clinic&#39;s lobby. Celest moved forward with Nicole at her side.

&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; Nicole asked, a worried look in her eyes.

&quot;Quistis had some kind of seizure....&quot; Zell said quietly, looking back 
at the closed door. He could only barely hear Kadowaki and Ellone 
exchanging frantic words.

&quot;What about Ellone and Fujin?&quot; Celest asked.

&quot;Ellone woke up, but Fujin&#39;s still unconscious....I don&#39;t know what 
happened.&quot; Seifer answered.

&quot;I do! You psycho jerk, you tried to wake her up!&quot; Zell snapped angrily.

&quot;Hey, hey, he was only trying to help ya know.&quot; Raijin said calmly. 
Miguel and Jaya pushed through ever-growing crowd of students and rushed 
forward.

&quot;What has happened?&quot; Miguel asked curiously.

&quot;Come on, I&#39;ll explain everything.&quot; Raijin sighed, leading them to one 
of the waiting room couches.

&quot;Way to go ass...&quot; Zell mumbled, looking at Seifer sourly.

&quot;Hey, that&#146;s not fair, he was trying to help.&quot; Celest countered 
bitterly.

&quot;Everyone shut up.&quot; Nicole said in exasperation. &quot;Isn&#39;t it enough that 
our friends are in there fighting for their lives. We could at least try 
and be civil to each other. Now why don&#39;t we all shut up and sit down, 
and wait for some word. The two men looked at each other in 
understanding and did as they were told.

Xu could be heard screeching in the hallway, shepherding the crowd and 
ordering them to disperse. After several moments the lobby was clear and 
she walked in with a severe expression.

&quot;This can&#39;t be good.&quot; She sighed, then noted everyone&#39;s faces. &quot;She 
gone...&quot; She said quietly, it was more a resigned statement than a 
question.

&quot;We don&#39;t know yet.&quot; Nicole said softly. Xu looked unsteady and sat 
down.

&quot;Damn it Quisty...&quot; She murmured worriedly with tears in her eyes.

************************

The convulsions had ceased and Kadowaki stood by cautiously. Ellone was 
at her side, shaken but unharmed.

&quot;Well?&quot; Ellone asked tensely.

&quot;She&#39;s okay, I think.&quot;

&quot;You think...?&quot;

&quot;Her signs are weak but stable, but on the plus side, there is some 
slight brain activity being registered...&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s good right!?&quot;

&quot;It may be, we&#39;ll just have to wait and see.&quot;

&quot;And Fujin?&quot;

Kadowaki looked to Fujin who was laid out on the couch.

&quot;She&#39;s sleeping as far as I can tell? What happened in there?&quot;

&quot;Well, we got the guardians then Fujin ran into a fragment of Quistis&#39; 
consciousness and everything went black...&quot;

Kadowaki noted the readouts on Quistis&#39; monitoring equipment.

&quot;These reading say she went into shock moments before the seizure. Which 
I can assume was brought on by your actions.&quot;

&quot;Oh my...&quot; Ellone gasped.

&quot;Damn it I told you two!&quot; Kadowaki sighed in exasperation. &quot;You could 
have killed her.&quot;

&quot;It was my fault...&quot; Ellone mumbled quietly.

Fujin exploded off the couch in a fit of screaming and thrashing. 
Lunging to her feet, she staggered towards the two women then fell over, 
only to stand up again on legs as unstable as a newborn calf.

&quot;nooorg....&quot; She rasped hoarsely.

&quot;Fujin!?&quot; Ellone squawked, terrified by the outburst.

&quot;My eye!&quot; Fujin croaked, staggering around the room like a drunken 
lunatic while clutching at her eye patch.

Kadowaki grabbed her in an attempt to calm her only to be punched in the 
face awkwardly. She fell back, holding her nose and cursing.

&quot;ZELL!&quot; Ellone shouted, calling for help.

The door to the room all but burst off the hinges as the trio of Seifer, 
Zell and Raijin stormed into the room in all their well meaning glory.

Fujin started to scream again, only this time it was cut short by a wet 
and haggard coughing.

&quot;Fu!?&quot; Raijin shouted, terrified.

&quot;What the hell is wrong with her? Is Quistis okay!?&quot; Zell babbled.

&quot;Grab her, get her to sit down, she&#39;s freaking out!&quot; Ellone shouted.

Fujin tried to speak but only a ragged gurgle came out. Celest, Nicole 
and Xu peered in the doorway in dismay just as Seifer and Raijin grabbed 
Fujin and wrestled her back onto the couch.

&quot;Doc, is Quisty okay or not?!&quot; Zell shouted again.

&quot;Yes, yes, she&#39;ll be fine!&quot; Kadowaki snapped, touching her bruised jaw 
gingerly.

&quot;Fujin...?&quot; Ellone whimpered worriedly.

&quot;Someone tell me what&#39;s going on ya know!&quot; Raijin blurted as Fujin 
thrashed wildly.

&quot;NORG!&quot; She screeched.

&quot;Fu calm down, it&#39;s okay.&quot; Seifer said sternly.

&quot;FUJIN!&quot; She snarled weakly.

&quot;Calm down, you&#39;re going to hurt yourself!&quot; Ellone shouted fearfully.

Taking a shuttering breath Fujin went limp. &quot;Where is she...?&quot; She 
wheezed pitifully.

&quot;Quistis is okay hon.&quot; Ellone answered, pointing to the bed where 
Quistis lay. &quot;You did it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m.... Fine...&quot; Fujin mumbled weakly, raising her head. Her expression 
tightened in horror as she saw Quistis lying still and motionless.

&quot;What!?&quot; She croaked, stiffening.

&quot;Um, Fu?&quot; Raijin said warily.

&quot;WHAT!?&quot; Fujin spat again, sounding as if she teetered on the edge of 
insanity.

&quot;Oh, she&#39;s about to pop.&quot; Zell said fearfully.

&quot;RIGHT....NOT RIGHT!!!&quot; She gurgled, amid a series of vicious coughs.

&quot;Hold her!&quot; Kadowaki ordered, as she approached with a needle in hand.

&quot;NOT RIGHT, NOT RIGHT!!!&quot; Fujin wheezed her gaze wide and fearful.

&quot;What the hell is wrong with her!?&quot; Xu shouted.

Kadowaki ignored them as she carefully stuck the needle into Fujin&#39;s 
arm.

&quot;not right...&quot; Fujin cried out again, tears welling up in her eye.

&quot;Oh hyne...&quot; Nicole whispered, crying as well. &quot;Help her, someone please 
help her...&quot;

&quot;What did you give her?&quot; Raijin asked Kadowaki as Fujin mumbled 
incoherently.

&quot;A sedative, it&#39;ll calm her.&quot; She answered grimly.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with her?&quot; Xu asked, stepping cautiously into the room.

&quot;It could be any number of things... I&#39;ll...have to run some 
tests...brain damage...dementia...I just don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;Brain damage!?&quot; Raijin stammered.

&quot;Son of a bitch...&quot; Seifer growled under his voice, looking down at 
Fujin in dismay.

&quot;No, no, no!&quot; Ellone cried. &quot;It&#39;s all my fault, I should&#39;ve stopped 
her!&quot;

&quot;Oh, hey, hey, hey!&quot; Celest blurted grabbing the near hysterical woman. 
&quot;Easy hon, you don&#39;t want the Doc to have to sedate you too.&quot;

Kadowaki sat down heavily on the edge of Quistis bed.

&quot;What&#39;s happened!&quot; Cid blurted, rushing into the room.

&quot;Sir...&quot; Xu stammered, caught off guard.

&quot;Are the girls okay?&quot; He asked quickly, surveying the situation.

&quot;I don&#39;t know yet.&quot; Kadowaki said once more, growing flustered. &quot;That&#146;s 
the best I can offer until I run some tests.&quot; She said busily, while 
motioning everyone to leave once more. &quot;Now if you excuse me, I think 
there&#39;s been enough drama for the day. I&#39;ll let you know if there is any 
change in their condition.&quot;

Regretfully, everyone did as they were told, Zell and Ellone walked with 
Cid to explain what happened while the others lingered briefly then went 
their separate ways. Xu remained behind and sat down heavily in the 
waiting room. Quistis was like a sister to her, and she wasn&#39;t going 
anywhere until she heard something more from Kadowaki.

After several long torturous hours, Kadowaki walked out of the room 
looking haggard and confused. Xu stood up to greet her with a fretful 
look.

&quot;I thought I told you to leave.&quot; Kadowaki frowned.

&quot;I wanted to be here in case....&quot; Xu mumbled. &quot;How are they...?&quot;

&quot;I um....&quot; Kadowaki sighed as Fujin staggered weakly out of the room, 
bracing herself against the doorway.

&quot;Fu?&quot; Xu whispered.

Fujin looked to Kadowaki as if for some sort of answer. She had none and 
merely shrugged helplessly.

&quot;Well...are you okay?&quot; Xu asked.

&quot;I&#39;m...fine....&quot; Fujin stuttered, wincing slightly.

&quot;Thank Hyne.&quot; Xu breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;And Quistis?&quot; She asked, 
daring to pray.

&quot;I...fine...&quot; Fujin said again, her voice barely audible as tears 
streamed down her cheek.

&quot;What?&quot; Xu blinked.

&quot;I...&quot; Fujin started to speak but fell instead into a series of wracking 
coughs.

Kadowaki ushered her to sit then she turned to face Xu.

&quot;You should sit down, this is going to be hard.&quot;

&quot;I prefer to stand.&quot; Xu said stiffly, fearing the worst.

&quot;Okay then...&quot; Kadowaki nodded, then looked to Fujin, who sat holding 
her head wearily.&quot;

&quot;Quistis is...&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; Xu mouthed wordlessly cutting her off.

&quot;Alive...&quot; Kadowaki finished.

Xu nearly fainted.

&quot;And?&quot; She quickly asked, waiting for some sort of bad news.

&quot;She um...&quot; Kadowaki started, but found herself at a loss.

&quot;Xu...&quot; Fujin choked, rubbing her throat. &quot;I&#39;m here...&quot;

Xu looked at Fujin in confusion then back at the doctor.

&quot;What?&quot; She asked tilting her head curiously like a confused child.

&quot;I...Quistis...&quot; Fujin whispered thinly.

&quot;That&#146;s not funny.&quot; Xu frowned then looked back at Kadowaki. The look on 
Kadowaki&#39;s face showed no sign of humor.

&quot;Oh, no, no, no, that can&#39;t be right!&quot; Xu stuttered, shaking her head 
while backing away.&quot;

&quot;Xu...&quot; Fujin groaned, as she tried in vain to stand but ended up 
falling back onto the couch feebly.

&quot;It&#39;s true.&quot; Kadowaki sighed, helping Fujin to her feet.&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot; Xu stammered.

&quot;Somehow, they were switched...&quot; Kadowaki explained as if she didn&#39;t 
believe it herself.

&quot;You&#39;re lying, both of you.&quot; Xu spat, looking terrified.

&quot;Xu...heart...&quot; Fujin said awkwardly.

&quot;I...what...? No...!&quot; Xu cried, shaking her head. &quot;Quisty!?&quot;

Fujin nodded then choked on her tears.

&quot;It&#39;s a lie, that&#146;s not possible.&quot; Xu stammered, overwhelmed.

&quot;But...what of Fujin then!?&quot; She finally said in exasperation.

&quot;Well...&quot; Kadowaki said slowly. &quot;Quistis&#39;.... Err...her body...that is, 
is showing signs of brain activity, and her pulse and respiration are 
stronger than they&#39;ve been for months... I can&#39;t explain it, but I&#39;m 
pretty sure Fujin is inside Quistis...&quot;

Xu twitched as if she had a nervous tick as she looked between the two 
women.

&quot;I...this...&quot; She groaned, holding her head. &quot;I need to sit down...&quot; She 
murmured then fell back into a waiting chair.&quot;

&quot;FIX!&quot; Fujin barked awkwardly startling Xu and Kadowaki both.

&quot;We will...calm down...&quot; Kadowaki winced.

&quot;I...FINE...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re going to hurt yourself trying to talk so much.&quot; Kadowaki sighed, 
rubbing her temples.

&quot;She&#39;s right.&quot; Xu nodded.

&quot;SCARED.&quot; Fujin whimpered.

&quot;We all are hon...&quot; Xu said awkwardly, still ill at ease. &quot;Doc... 
How...?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t even know.&quot; Kadowaki said, cutting off the question. &quot;Most 
likely, something Ellone did by accident.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll go get her!&quot; Xu blurted, jumping up.

&quot;No, no. It&#39;s late, let her rest. In fact we all should, everyone is 
okay for now, we can deal with this in the morning.&quot;

&quot;WHAT!?&quot; Fujin, blurted. &quot;WHAT IF WE CAN&#39;T DO ANYTHING BY....&quot; She 
started to spout then fell over in pain.

&quot;I told you...&quot; Kadowaki frowned, checking her over.

&quot;Is she okay?&quot; Xu asked, moving tentatively closer.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Kadowaki answered then turned her attention back to her patient. 
&quot;Look, Quistis, you have to be careful. You have to realize you&#39;re in 
Fujin&#39;s body, you have to be careful or you&#39;re liable to hurt her.&quot; She 
said in a motherly tone.

&quot;Fu...&quot; Fujin murmured worriedly.

&quot;It&#39;ll be okay, I promise. You just need to take it easy and stay calm.&quot; 
Kadowaki smiled softly.

&quot;We&#39;ll um, take care of everything...&quot; Xu said weirdly, still having 
trouble dealing with everything laid out in front of her.

Fujin nodded stiffly and wiped her face clean of tears.

&quot;Okay, now.&quot; Kadowaki smiled. &quot;It&#39;s best we all turn in for the night, 
were in for a long day tomorrow.&quot;

******************************

Fujin, or more accurately Quistis, spent the majority of the evening 
sitting quietly gazing at her body as it lay helpless in its bed.

&quot;This is wrong....&quot; She thought glumly. No one had taken much time to 
accurately explain what had happened. The last thing she recalled was 
the fight with Norg and some odd dream where Fujin appeared to her. The 
next thing she knew she was awake and staring at her own form, gaunt and 
apparently caught in the throes of a deep coma. Somehow, someway, Fujin 
had saved her, but at what cost?

&quot;Fu...&quot; She whispered, then winced. Talking was a hellish affair, as if 
the body she inhabited wasn&#39;t built for normal speech. Which wasn&#39;t far 
from the truth, Fujin&#39;s impediment was a constant hassle for her and now 
she understood just how much.

Fujin had her entire life to learn to deal with the problem and was 
still only able to talk in short clipped sentences. Small wonder then 
that Quistis had no idea how to begin doing so without causing pain. It 
was a minor annoyance though, for what was really troubling her, was 
Fujin&#39;s fate. She knew, somehow, that Fujin was alive and trapped in her 
own body just as she was in hers. She was overwhelmed, all her years of 
training and experience in dealing with Guardians never prepared for 
anything like this.

Sighing, she prayed Ellone had the answer. Reaching out, she awkwardly 
stroked her hair, it was strange, seeing herself from the outside. Then 
thoughtfully, she caressed Fujin&#39;s cheek then her lips, the same lips 
she had kissed so many time before.

&quot;You can&#39;t leave me.... Not after all we&#39;ve been through.&quot; She thought 
helplessly. &quot;I won&#39;t let it end like this...I won&#39;t give up.&quot;

Standing up shakily she tottered. Everything was so alien. The way she 
heard things, the way she moved and most off all her vision. It was 
distracting, with Fujin having only one eye, the entire world looked 
different, narrower. She had to use the restroom, a prospect that was 
wholly uncomfortable considering it wasn&#39;t her body. As she started to 
walk, she wobbled from foot to foot like a toddler learning to walk. If 
not for the dire circumstances she would&#39;ve been fascinated. It was 
startling how much someone takes advantage of the little things.
