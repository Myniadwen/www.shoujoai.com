<p>“What are you so  happy about today?” Selphie demanded as Xu all but skipped by them.  She twirled around and got in line, smiling from ear to ear looking  like all the world like a girl that just got too much…</p>
<p>“She’s prolly just  happy that Quistis is back.” Aya said over her magazine article. Xu  laughed brightly and gave them a cryptic smile.</p>
<p>“You will never  know.”</p>
<p>“Everyone’s  keeping secrets from me…” Selphie pouted. “Quisty’s got a  boyfriend, now Xu’s got a boyfriend…”</p>
<p>“Neither of us has  got a boyfriend, Selphie, I’m just in a good mood. Quistis is  getting back on her feet and it makes me happy.” Xu replied between  bouts of humming. Aya suddenly tensed as she looked up sharply. Her  eye twitched for a moment as she fought back a smile before resuming  her reading.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with  you?” Selphie asked.</p>
<p>“The article…says  here that the Gardens have been granted an even larger sum to expand.  Rumor of an Esthar and a Lunar Garden have been creeping up.” She  replied all to convincingly.</p>
<p>“Oh blah. You’re  incredibly boring, you know that?” Selphie stuck out her tongue.  Rinoa exited the line with her tray in hand and sat down with them.</p>
<p>“What’s floating  your boat?” She asked, nodding to Xu.</p>
<p>“See!” Selphie  shouted. “I’m not the only one who thinks something is amiss.”</p>
<p>“A ‘Miss’ is  right…” Aya said cheekily, not looking up though her attention  wasn’t focused on the paper anymore. Xu eyed the librarian warily  but was too caught up in the fact that she had a beautiful girl  waiting for her back in her room to really pay much attention. As she  approached the front of the line, Aya excused herself and left the  room. Xu grabbed two trays of food, kindly explaining the situation  to the lunch ladies who gladly gave her two helpings.</p>
<p>As Xu left the  cafeteria, Aya was waiting for her.</p>
<p>“So…you need any  help?” She asked. Xu jumped in surprise.</p>
<p>“HYNE! Don’t do  that!” She snapped.</p>
<p>“Well,  need help or not?” Aya asked.</p>
<p>“Uh…sure…”  Xu said, handing her one tray. The two walked to the dorms and Aya  waited until no one was within hearing range before speaking.</p>
<p>“So…uh…you two  are dating, are you? Or is this a hush hush thing? Or is it that you  have a crush on Quistis or something?” This time, Xu stopped  walking and nearly dropped the tray. She had no words to express her  shock or embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Uh…what…where…uh…”  She stammered.</p>
<p>“It’s kinda  obvious there’s something going on…I mean, sure, I’m more  observant and more open minded about the entire thing than Selphie  and Rinoa are. You tend to learn a lot from reading as many books as  I have.” Seeing Xu’s look of panic, she quickly reassured her. “I  won’t tell, I’m just curious. Hell, you can leave me guessing but  I’m just kinda…”</p>
<p>“We’re…hush  hush…” Xu said finally. Aya’s eyebrows shot up.</p>
<p>“Seriously? I  mean…you two? Really? Wow, I didn’t think either of you had  enough courage to say anything.” She replied.</p>
<p>“Thanks…” Xu  sneered acidly.</p>
<p>“I don’t mean it  in a bad way. I’m just saying, love is harder than defeating  Ultimecia. Scarier too.” She scratched her head. “Personally, I’m  just glad you two are happy.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell  anyone.” Xu pleaded.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Just…don’t…I  don’t want to explain.” She said as they arrived at the door. She  opened the door and Quistis was there to greet her with a kiss. Aya  blinked in surprise and Quistis noticed her, jumping back.</p>
<p>“It’s not what  you…I mean…”</p>
<p>“She knows.” Xu  explained. Quistis looked from Aya to Xu’s ashen face.</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>“Well, I suppose  I’ll leave you two alone now. Um…a word of warning, Quisits…you  were lucky this time because no one saw but me. But next time, don’t  jump her like that. People will see.” Aya handed Quistis the tray,  waved and walked down the hall again. Xu brushed by setting her tray  down.</p>
<p>“Xu…is everything  ok?” Quistis asked, setting her tray down next to Xu’s. The  brunette sat down on the couch and noticed pictures lying around. “I  uh…found the in a drawer. See? There’s a couple of pictures of  us.” She pointed. Suddenly, Xu jumped forwards, shifting the  pictures around violently.</p>
<p>“Quistis, where is  the picture!” She yelled franticly.</p>
<p>“Picture, what  picture.”</p>
<p>“Of Becca? Where is  it? I can’t find it!”</p>
<p>“Xu…calm down…”</p>
<p>“You don’t go  through my stuff!” Xu’s voice was getting louder and more  frightened as pictures fell to the floor. Quistis picked out one  picture, a black and white photo of a girl standing and smiling with  a grey sky in the background.</p>
<p>“Is this it…”  She asked timidly. Xu snatched it out of her hand and cradled it.  Quistis felt hurt and she shrunk away.</p>
<p>“Don’t…don’t  go through my stuff…this is the only picture I have of her…” Xu  whispered.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.” Xu  looked up and saw how hurt Quistis was. It killed her inside. “I  didn’t know…I was just…looking for utensils…” Xu set the  picture down carefully and hugged Quistis, kissing her cheeks.</p>
<p>“No…I’m sorry.  It’s just that…Becca meant a lot to me.” She began tearing up.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to  apologize. It’s my fault.”</p>
<p>“No. I need to tell  you about her. It’s not fair that I have secrets from you.  Especially something I really need to tell you because I love you and  I don’t want to hurt you.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”  Quistis was interested in knowing more about her but she was afraid  that something might make her sad again.</p>
<p>“Becca was…16 I  think when I was that little. I lived in an orphanage different from  all of you and it wasn’t as happy a place. The matron there made us  work until our hands and knees bled and we collapsed from exhaustion.  She would hit us with a wooden spoon really hard if we so much as  stopped to catch our breaths. She hated me the most because well…I  rebelled the most. I…” Xu smiled. “I took breaks and I would  hit her back. But every time she’d get her mean husband to beat me  up. He’d hit me much harder and he’d rip my hair if I tried to  fight back. I was teased a lot…because she told the other kids that  I was a bad girl and that they should be mean. I suffered a lot  through those years.</p>
<p>Becca stood up for me.  She was one of the ‘elders’ as we kids liked to call them. They  usually went to the city to work in the morning and brought home  money and food in the evening. There were a good 4 or 5 of them but  none of them liked me, except Becca.” Xu swallowed. “I used to  cry myself to sleep. Then…one night as I was crying, Becca came  over and started stroking my hair. And she hummed for me and stayed  with me until I went to sleep. And she did that every night from then  on. I loved her so much. She’d tell all the other kids not to bully  me, they did anyway when she wasn’t around but I stayed with her  for a year and I was so happy.</p>
<p>And then one day…when  Becca snuck me some food, something that was absolutely forbidden  even though I got half the normal ration, the matron’s husband and  his friends caught her...”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>“Bitch! So that’s where all the food has been  going! You’ve been sneaking it to this rat of a girl!” The  drunken man slapped Becca across the face.</em>
<p><em>“She hasn’t had anything to eat for the  past three days! You give her half a loaf of bread every week! That's half the other kids' ration! How do  you expect her to live!” Becca demanded, standing up after the  blow.</em></p>
<p><em>“She doesn’t deserve to live! She’s a  slacker and she’s got a mean attitude. You think anyone’s going  to want to adopt a rat like her? The sooner she dies, the sooner we  have less trouble!”</em></p>
<p><em>“You work her too hard!” Becca yelled. Xu  looked on, trembling with fear. She held on tightly to Becca’s  robe.</em></p>
<p><em>“Come here!” The old man grabbed Xu by the  hair and she shrieked in pain.</em></p>
<p><em>“Let her go!” Becca ordered, hitting his  hand.</em></p>
<p><em>“Fine! You wanna come along too!” His  friends grabbed hold of her arms and dragged her outside. They walked  along the side of the road for a while until the house was far out of  sight. The old man shoved Xu onto her knees and started kicking and  beating her.</em></p>
<p><em>“STOP!” Becca shrieked, struggling.  “You’re going to kill her!” Xu cried out, sobbing as punch  after kick landed. “I swear I’ll kill you!” The old man stopped  and turned around, malicious intent shining in his eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>“So…you’ll kill me…eh?” He walked  closer. “You…you’re a pretty little girl aren’t you? Taking a  liking to this rat? Well?”</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<em>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
</em>
</p>
<p>“They raped her.”  Xu whispered, her voice shaking uncontrollably. “The three of them.  They raped her and they knifed her. They stabbed her a bunch of  times, from her stomach to her chest…they…” She closed her eyes  and began crying. Quistis put her arms around Xu and held her close.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>“Heh, there’ll  be no more stealing.” Xu curled up in a ball and cried loudly.  “Well then…what about you?” He chuckled. “Don’t cry…you’ll  be joining her…”</em>
<p><em>“Diamond Dust…” A voice hissed. All  three of them froze instantly and broke apart into small pieces. Xu  couldn’t stop crying. She sobbed softly as the area grew colder and  she crawled painfully over to Becca’s side. A soft light descended  upon her, a blue and white light. It was a guardian force, Shiva.</em></p>
<p><em>“Becca…Becca?” Xu whimpered. “Please…I  wanna sleep…please sing for me…”</em></p>
<p><em>“Little girl…” Shiva said. “Poor  child.” It got colder and colder. “Come…let us take you  somewhere safe…” Xu felt her eyes grow heavy and she held onto  Becca’s body tightly. Shiva gently enveloped Xu and she went to  sleep, too hurt and too traumatized to do anything else. Shiva gently  scooped up the child, afraid of freezing her. “I will watch over  you…I promised Rebecca that I would.”</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<em>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
</em>
</p>
<p>“That’s  where Shiva came from?” Quistis asked. Quistis remembered that Xu had  given it to her almost the day after they had become friends.</p>
<p>“Yes…I gave her to  you because I couldn’t stand having something that belonged to  Becca roaming in my head. Shiva was junctioned to Becca and she  didn’t even know it. And when she died…Shiva saved me…Becca  saved me…” Xu leaned against Quistis and the blonde cradled Xu’s  head against her chest.</p>
<p>“It’s  ok…Xu…hon…it’s ok.” She whispered, kissing her forehead.  “I’m here after all. I’m not exactly the perfect substitute for  Becca but I’m something.” Xu sniffed.</p>
<p>“You’re everything  to me right now.” Quistis twitched, trying to force back a smile.</p>
<p>“You do realize how  cheesy that sounded…right?” She asked.</p>
<p>“…Yeah. I’m  beginning to regret it.” Xu giggled.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Adel stepped off the  boat and onto the beaches of the orphanage. She spun around, taking  in the scenery of her new home.
<p>“It’s very  beautiful and quiet.” She commented.</p>
<p>“Why thank you,  Adel. Cid and I don’t like a lot of raucous noises.” Edea  replied, holding Cid’s hand as she stepped onto the beach as well.</p>
<p>“It’s nice…and  it’s filled with lots of memories too.” Adel whispered, squatting  and running her fingers through the sand. “Lots of memories  indeed.”</p>
<p>“Are they good  memories?” Edea asked, walking up beside her. Adel looked at the  ground and shrugged.</p>
<p>“Some. Some are  good, some are painful.” She replied. “Some are dark.” She  looked up at Edea who shrunk back a little.</p>
<p>“Edea, my dear, why  don’t we ask some of these wonderful young men and women to help us  rebuild?” Cid asked, studying the white SeeD.</p>
<p>“That’s fine with  me, dear. Just don’t over work them.” She shouted. Cid smiled and  turned to the three young men standing on the dock. They looked  nervously at each other when Cid asked them to help but they agreed,  thinking it wise not to mess with the husband of a former sorceress.</p>

Squall was confused.  He had invited Rinoa to an unreservedly expensive restaurant and she  spent half the time not conversing but staring at the embroidered red  napkin. He cleared his throat.
<p>“Uh…Rinoa…is  there something bothering you?” He asked.</p>
<p>“Quistis.” She  replied. Squall sighed. For a moment he was a little nervous that it  was he who was at fault.</p>
<p>“Quistis is fine.  She’s making an speedy recovery. She’ll be teaching in two days.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I  meant.” She replied, looking up at him. “Quistis has been single  for as long as we’ve known her. Well, as long as I’ve known her.  And it seems like she’s just clinging onto her past a little too  much. I just want to see her as happy as we are or any other healthy  couple.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you should  leave her alone.” Squall suggested then quickly realized what he  said. “What I mean is…she knows what’s good for her. When the  time comes, she’ll find someone. I was single longer than she was.”  Rinoa blushed.</p>
<p>“Yeah, until I came  along.” Squall coughed sheepishly and took a sip of his wine. “I  just want to know when and if that someone’s going to come along.  If he takes too long…I dunno…I mean…especially with Quistis’s  powers. I have powers too but it’s from Edea…not from Ultimecia  herself.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry so  much.” Squall sighed. He was tired of Quistis being the subject of  their conversation. He wanted to have a nice dinner with Rinoa so  that she couldn’t hound him later for ignoring her when work reared  its demonized head.</p>
<p>“When do we get  married?” Rinoa asked absently. Squall choked on his wine.</p>
<p>“What!” He  demanded.</p>
<p>“Oh…nothing. Just  reading the quote over there.” She said pointing to a picture of a  couple with the bubbles, “When do we get married?” It was an  advertisement for the restaurant’s catering for weddings. The  couple was happily depicted as wanting to get married after seeing  the restaurant. Squall studied Rinoa who had a look of absolute  boredom on her face. And it occurred to him…maybe he did want to  marry her.</p>
<p>“Welcome  mademoiselle. Please, step this way.” The waiter said courteously.  Rinoa looked over and her eyes went wide.</p>
<p>“Xu?” She  demanded. Xu saw them, turned around and sprinted out the door.  Rinoa, wondering what was up and overly curious as to why Xu was  here, perhaps on a date, stood up. “I’ll be right back.”</p>
<p>Quistis was about to  step in the door, dressed in an evening gown until Xu nearly tackled  her outside.</p>
<p>“RUN!” Xu yelled.  Quistis trusted her girlfriend’s judgment and turned around,  sprinting around the corner as fast as she could in high heels. “I’ll  stall!” Xu turned around and mentally prepared herself for the  questions that were bound to crop up as soon as Rinoa caught up.</p>
<p>“XU!” Rinoa  shouted.</p>
<p>“Hey…wasn’t  quite expecting you.” She said.</p>
<p>“You turned around  and ran. What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“Uh…nothing.  Nothing at all.”</p>
<p>“Are you on a date?”  Rinoa asked coyly.</p>
<p>“NO! What are you,  crazy? I just felt like eating…really really fancy tonight. I  dunno…just a treat or something.” She lied.</p>
<p>“You’re a bad liar  Xu, when it comes to this.” She giggled. “So…where is he? I  know you came here with someone…don’t think I’m going to let  you…”</p>
<p>“Look at what I found.  Instructor Trepe wandering around on a dark and fairly dangerous night.” Seifer said, coming up to Xu with  Quistis held in his gloved hand. Xu looked at Quistis, all but  panicked and then turned back to Rinoa. <em>I’m so going to hate  myself for this.</em> She thought and grabbed onto Seifer’s arm  before Rinoa could jump to any conclusions.</p>
<p>“I give. I came here  with Seifer…I was just, uh, worried that you know…seeing as how  he’s your ex and all…” Seifer looked baffled and was about to  open his mouth when Xu leaned in close.</p>
<p>“Just play along or  I’m going to detach you limb from limb.” She hissed. Seifer  looked from Xu to Quistis…then smirked.</p>
<p>“Yeah…didn’t  realize you’d be here.” He said. All Rinoa could do was babble on  the spot.</p>
<p>“But…you  two…nothing in common…wha…?”</p>
<p>“Well, maybe that’s  a good thing.” Seifer replied. “Now if you’ll excuse us…”  He offered his arm out to Xu, which she took. The two of them walked  off, Quistis following with daggers in her eyes.</p>
<p>As soon as they were  out of sight, Xu threw Seifer’s arm away as quickly and strongly as  possible.</p>
<p>“Ew. I can’t  believe I did that.” She hissed, looking at her hands and arms.  Seifer turned around, the smirk on his face unbearably coy. Quistis  stepped beside Xu.</p>
<p>“So…why are two  fine young ladies out on the town tonight, alone?”</p>
<p>“Ladies night out,  Seifer.” Quistis snapped.</p>
<p>“Really…? In such  fine evening gowns and going to such a nice restaurant? I  dunno…sounds more like a date to me. But maybe I’m just a  testosterone loaded guy…” He chuckled.</p>
<p>“You are a  testosterone loaded guy.” Xu spat.</p>
<p>“And you needed me  so badly to lie about being your date? Were you just trying to cover  up something? Maybe Rinoa needs to know the truth. You know…make  assumptions of her own.” Seifer shrugged, the smile on his face  growing. Quistis and Xu looked at each other.</p>
<p>“We’re simply  enjoying a night out.”</p>
<p>“Together?”</p>
<p>“Yes, together.”  Quistis said before Xu could. Seifer stopped and balked.</p>
<p>“Woah…you serious?  I was…I was kidding…I mean…you two are really?” He stammered.  Xu gave Quistis a shocked expression. Quistis took out her whip and  walked up close to him.</p>
<p>“Now Seifer…be a  good boy and don’t tell anyone about this…” She whispered.  Seifer’s eye twitched. “Cuz if you don’t…” And just like  that, Quistis stood behind Seifer with her whip tightly wound around  his neck.</p>
<p>“K…got…it…”  Seifer gasped. The Instructor smiled and let go. “Jeez…if you  wanted to play dominatrix…” Xu glared at him and he laughed  nervously. “You and Xu should just rent a room. Well, certainly is  a nice night out…I’ll just be, you know…leaving.” He  scampered off quickly. The two of them sighed and looked at each  other. Xu gently slipped her hand into Quistis’s and shook her  head.</p>
<p>“That guy’s prolly  going to rat on us.” Quistis smiled and her arms encircled her  partner’s waist.</p>
<p>“Yeah…well, we’ll  deal.” She kissed the side of Xu’s head gently. “Come on, we’ve  got the whole rest of the night. What do you want to do?” Xu smiled  evilly and Quistis began to regret that she asked her for a  suggestion. Some how she figured that showing Xu the whip and having  Seifer make the comment put ideas into her beloved’s head.</p>
