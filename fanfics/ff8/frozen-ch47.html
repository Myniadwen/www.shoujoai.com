It was a good two hours before Quistis and Fujin finally arrived at the 
pool. After their encounter Quistis felt a little daring so opted for a 
saucy bikini, while Fujin settled for a modest but stylish one-piece. 
Irvine voiced his approval as the girls approached with an ear splitting 
whistle. Selphie promptly beat him silly with a rolled up towel then 
waved merrily to Quistis.

Nicole, remembering her near drowning days before, sat well away from 
the pools edge. Quistis sat her towel and sun block down then gazed up 
at the large open sunroof.

&quot;It&#39;s a hot day I see.&quot; She said squinting before putting on a pair of 
sunglasses.

&quot;Yup hot.&quot; Irvine said in a randy tone while looking her over, this time 
it was Fujin turn, she smacked him in the back of the head causing him 
to jump in surprise. He spun around and looked at her acidly.

&quot;Don&#39;t you start too! I get enough from this one.&quot; He scowled, thumbing 
towards Selphie who promptly whapped him again.

Fujin huffed and sat down heavily in one of the reclining chairs, being 
sure to find one that was well out of direct sunlight.

&quot;I was wondering when you&#39;d show up.&quot; Rinoa shouted from the far end of 
the pool, where she and Aeka lounged on floats.

&quot;Sorry got tied up.&quot; Quistis shouted back causing Fujin to arch a brow.

&quot;You keep yourself too busy.&quot; Nicole said quietly from under an overly 
large and utterly silly looking sun hat. &quot;You&#39;ll get old before your 
time.&quot;

&quot;Yeah well, things to do.&quot; Quistis responded breezily.

Nicole stood and walked over to where Quistis, Irvine and Selphie lay.

&quot;I wanted to thank you guys.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot; Irvine wondered.

&quot;For the party and staying over, I really needed the company, thanks.&quot; 
She smiled fondly.

&quot;It&#39;s okay hon, it was fun.&quot; Quistis smiled.

&quot;Yeah it was.&quot; Selphie agreed. &quot;It&#39;s been to long since we all got 
together.

&quot;Oh well everyone just forget boring old Irvine, no one invite him to 
the sleep over. He can sleep outside and be by his lonesome all night.&quot; 
Irvine grumbled in an attempt to garner pity.

&quot;Please.&quot; Selphie giggled.

&quot;How in the world did you talk Fujin into coming, I figured she hated me 
after what I said.&quot; Nicole asked Quistis curiously.

&quot;She felt bad about what happened last time. It really upset her, so she 
wanted to make amends. That and she owes Zell, apparently he took the 
blame for the little stunt with the Ragnarok at Snow Ridge.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah, what was that about?&quot; Irvine asked suspiciously.

&quot;Crowd was getting ugly so she scared em off with the ship.&quot; Quistis 
explained with a grin.

&quot;No not that, I meant why&#39;d you take her along, you two seem inseparable 
lately.&quot;

&quot;Well, I needed a vacation, and you guys, all have significant others. 
Any of you would go nuts if the other weren&#39;t around. It&#39;s not like I 
could ask Rinoa to go and leave Squall behind, or you Selphie without 
Irvine. Fujin was being hassled and she&#39;s good company, so I took her.&quot;

&quot;Un huh.&quot; Selphie sulked. &quot;You don&#39;t love me.&quot; She teased. &quot;I thought we 
were friends.&quot; She continued, even faking tears.

&quot;Oh please.&quot; Quistis laughed.

&quot;I know what she means,&quot; Nicole said. &quot;I&#39;m going nuts worrying about 
Zell and he&#39;s only been gone a short time. I know he&#39;s okay but I&#39;m just 
beside myself.&quot;

&#39;Say what you want.&quot; Irvine smiled lewdly. &quot;Romantic place like that, 
two cute gals alone, hot fires, cold weather, strangers and rich guys. 
I&#39;m thinking they went looking for love.&quot; He whistled low and wore a 
wolfish grin.

Quistis couldn&#39;t help but blush.

&quot;It&#39;s wasn&#39;t like that in the least.&quot;

&quot;Un huh.&quot; Nicole smiled shrewdly.

&quot;I believe her.&quot; Selphie said quietly.

&quot;So what was his name?&quot; Irvine prodded eagerly.

&quot;You&#39;re crazy.&quot; Quistis laughed again.

Fujin got up from her seat and walked past the group to sit by the edge 
of the pool. Sticking her feet in the water she toyed with the idea of 
jumping in.

&quot;You mean to have me believe, you didn&#39;t chase after anyone you&#39;re 
entire time there?&quot; Irvine said unconvinced.

&quot;I didn&#39;t go there to chase guys, ask Fujin.&quot; Quistis said adamantly.

Irvine looked over his shoulder to the pale woman.

&quot;Well?&quot; He asked.

Fujin slipped into the water and submerged without a word. She finally 
popped back up out of the water and looked at the group with a less that 
friendly expression.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; She sighed.

&quot;Did you two go hunting cute guys up at Snow Ridge?&quot; Nicole asked with a 
smirk.

&quot;NO NEED.&quot; Fujin responded blandly, already growing bored with the 
conversation.

&quot;Bull hockey.&quot; Irvine snapped. &quot;And why not?&quot;

&quot;HAD QUISTIS.&quot; Fujin said simply before dunking back under the water.

&quot;That&#146;s right honey.&quot; Quistis laughed then blew her a kiss.

&quot;ACK.&quot; Selphie nearly choked on her drink

&quot;That&#146;s what I&#39;m talking about!&quot; Irvine howled in glee.

&quot;And you people say Fujin doesn&#39;t have a sense of humor.&quot; Nicole 
laughed.

&quot;Seriously we didn&#39;t go up there to hunt guys. We just went to relax, 
heck Fujin spent two days sick as a dog.&quot;

&quot;That must sucks.&quot; Selphie said with a frown.

&quot;You seem a bit more understanding.&quot; Quistis said looking at the small 
woman warily.

&quot;Someone made me take a ugly look in the mirror.&quot; Selphie said weakly 
and leaned against Irvine.

&quot;Awww.&quot; Nicole crooned.

&quot;GOOD NEWS.&quot; Xu bellowed as she strode into the pool house.

&quot;Xu!&quot; Quistis called merrily. Xu beamed brightly as she made her way 
towards everyone.

&quot;Hi all. Cid sent me to tell Rinoa and Nicole that Eshtar&#39;s military 
spotted the Ragnarok flying right out outskirts of their territory.&quot;

Rinoa fell off her float and Nicole gave a shout of glee.

&quot;Well did you contact them!&quot; She said eagerly.

&quot;No, the Ragnarok&#39;s either under Radio silence or it&#39;s out all together. 
But I figured you guys would be happy to know that they didn&#39;t crash or 
something horrible. Chances are, they&#39;re on some sort of secret mission 
and are keeping it need to know.&quot; Xu said apologetically.

Nicole&#39;s smile faded slightly but she looked relived. Rinoa climbed out 
of the pool to scamper towards Xu with outstretched arms.

&quot;No, No, No, I&#39;m on duty!&quot; Xu protested as Rinoa tried to hug her 
joyfully.

Rinoa relented and settled on giggling merrily.

&quot;Told you they&#39;d be fine.&quot; Quistis smiled, happy to hear the good news.

Fujin was fairly oblivious to the conversation and decided to commandeer 
Rinoa&#39;s abandoned float. Stretching out glanced over to Aeka, who lay on 
a matching float, fast asleep. The young woman was looking as though she 
was well on her way to getting sunburn. Being sympathetic to that sort 
of affliction, Fujin did the only thing she could and promptly flipped 
the girl into the water. Aeka came up like a cork. Sputtering and 
yelling royally. With a growl she tossed a glaring look towards Fujin.

&quot;WHY!?&quot;

Fujin ignored her tone.

&quot;BURNING.&quot;

&quot;You could have just woke me!&quot; Aeka snapped sourly.

&quot;AWAKE NOW.&quot; Fujin pointed out.

Aeka huffed cutely and noticed the new arrivals.

&quot;Miss Trepe!&quot; She shouted loudly.

&quot;Hey Aeka.&quot; Quistis waved before settled back down to soak up the sun.

Xu looked everyone over with disapproval.

&quot;Hyne you people look like you are just having too much fun.&quot; She said 
with open envy.

&quot;Well lady you can all strip down to your skivvies and join us.&quot; Irvine 
said with a wink.

&quot;Hush, DAD!&quot; Selphie said sharply causing him to blush.

&quot;I would if I had time guys, honestly. I&#39;ve a lot on my roster today. 
Apparently one of our best maintenance guys up and vanished in the sub 
sectors. Some of his coworkers said he had a bad heart. Last thing we 
need is someone falling over dead down there. It could take weeks to 
find the poor soul.&quot;

&quot;If ever.&quot; Nicole said sadly.

&quot;Until the smell.&quot; Irvine pointed out grimly.

&quot;Oh gross.&quot; Selphie squeaked, wrinkling her nose.

&quot;You don&#39;t think he&#39;s dead do you?&quot; Rinoa asked worriedly.

&quot;I think so, he was last seen a few days ago when the heat freaked out. 
A team went to investigate but nothing turned up.&quot; Xu folded her arms 
and shrugged. &quot;All I know is that Cid&#39;s not happy. The guy went down 
there by himself, that&#146;s against the rules.&quot;

&quot;Someone is going to get in trouble.&quot; Quistis said knowingly.

&quot;Let&#39;s change the subject guys, this is depressing me again.&quot; Nicole 
asked quietly.

&quot;Yeah really.&quot; Selphie frowned.

&quot;Thanks Xu, way to bring everyone down.&quot; Quistis teased.

&quot;Gee sorry.&quot; Xu responded meekly. &quot; I have to go anyway I&#39;ve got to meet 
Celest&#39;s class in the training center later for their Infiltration 
training. I&#39;ll be glad when Squall gets back; I&#39;m tired of doing all his 
paperwork.&quot; She sighed heavily and turned to leave. &quot;Anyway, I&#39;ll catch 
you guys later. Try not to have too much fun.&quot; She said, waving goodbye 
as she left the pool house.

&quot;Told you.&quot; Selphie giggled to Rinoa.

&quot;Thank goodness.&quot; Rinoa breathed.

&quot;I&#39;ll beat him senseless.&quot; Nicole pouted, causing everyone to regard her 
curiously.

&quot;What?&quot; Asked Quistis.

&quot;Then he did forget!&quot; Nicole grumbled shaking her head back in forth in 
anger.

&quot;Uh oh.&quot; Selphie whistled.

&quot;Zell&#39;s a dead man.&quot; Irvine grinned.

&quot;I&#39;m sure he meant to be back on time, they obviously got held up.&quot; 
Quistis reasoned.

&quot;Yeah surely.&quot; Rinoa agreed.

Aeka, who was treading water, listened to the exchange a moment longer 
before swimming over to Fujin.

&quot;Miss Fujin?&quot;

&quot;NO MISS!&quot; Fujin barked in annoyance.

&quot;EEP!&quot; Aeka yelped, dunking down in the water to where only her eyes and 
the top of her head shown.

Fujin rolled her eye and motioned for the young girl to approach. Aeka 
moved closer and propped herself on the edge of the pool near Fujin&#39;s 
float.

&quot;Can I ask some advice?&quot; She asked worriedly.

&quot;ASK.&quot;

&quot;What do you know of men?&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot;

&quot;You know, relationships with guys?&quot;

&quot;WHY?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll I&#39;m wondering what I need to do to get someone&#39;s attention.&quot;

&quot;DON&#39;T.&quot; Fujin answered quickly.

&quot;What, and why not?&quot;

&quot;TO YOUNG.&quot;

&quot;I am not, I&#39;m nearly eighteen.&quot;

Fujin grumbled, Aeka was asking the wrong person about such things.

&quot;FINE.&quot;

&quot;So are you gonna help me?&quot;

&quot;ASK QUISTIS.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;WHY?&quot;

&quot;It would be weird she&#39;s my teacher.&quot;

&quot;WHY ME THEN?&quot;

&quot;Well you&#39;re old and experienced, plus you seem like you can keep a 
secret.&quot;

&quot;OLD?&quot; Fujin said acidly causing Aeka to backpedal her words.

&quot;Older!&quot; She quickly corrected.

&quot;WHO?&quot;

&quot;Royce.&quot;

Fujin chuckled, causing Aeka to scowl slightly.

&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot;

&quot;HARDLY SECRET.&quot; Fujin pointed out with a wry smirk.

&quot;We&#39;ll -he- doesn&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;TELL HIM THEN.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t do that.&quot;

&quot;THEN DON&#39;T COMPLAIN.&quot; Fujin said with a harsh cough.

&quot;It&#39;s not that easy.&quot;

&quot;I KNOW.&quot;

&quot;I want him to notice me. Sometimes it seems like he does, but then he 
treats me like I&#39;m his little sister. Either that or he&#39;s swooning over 
Miss Trepe.&quot;

Fujin nodded knowingly, she noticed how Royce would look at Quistis in 
class and wondered if she looked the same. The thought of it made her 
grin.

&quot;You think this is funny?&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Should I try different clothes or more makeup, what about cooking 
dinner?&quot;

Fujin was at a loss and was feeling more uncomfortable with the 
conversation as it moved on.

&quot;I DON&#39;T KNOW.&quot; She finally admitted, then fell into the throes of a 
wracking cough.

&quot;Are you tormenting Fujin?&quot; Quistis said laughingly, causing Aeka jump 
with a start. The girl looked up to see her teacher looking down at her 
from the pool&#39;s edge.

&quot;No Ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;YES.&quot; Fujin said in a gravely voice before sliding off the float and 
into the water. Aeka smiled apologetically as Quistis sat down.

&quot;Seems to be a matter of dispute here.&quot; Quistis laughed, dipping her 
legs into the water.

&quot;Just asking for advice.&quot; Aeka sighed.

Fujin submerged, wishing to avoid any more questions about 
relationships, a subject she was only, now, learning herself.

&quot;Is this about Royce again.&quot; Quistis sighed with a kind smile.

Aeka blushed profusely.

&quot;Just tell him you like him for crying aloud.&quot; Quistis laughed.

&quot;Oh you&#39;re just like Fujin.&quot; Aeka cried out in dismay she then looked 
around devilishly to make sure no one was around. &quot;Besides Ma&#39;am you&#39;re 
one to talk.&quot; She said with a scandalous tone.

Quistis exploded into laughter.

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

Aeka flapped her hands to quiet her down.

&quot;Ahem, Miss Fujin is back, did -you- ever tell her how you feel?&quot; The 
girl said quietly, figuring Quistis wasn&#39;t following her own advice.

&quot;Well.&quot; Quistis started unsure how or even if she should answer.

&quot;Remember we made a deal.&quot; Aeka giggled.

&quot;Yes, yes, the dance.&quot; Quistis snapped merrily.

Fujin popped up on the far end of the pool and climbed out. Already 
feeling slightly ill from being in the sun to long and retired to a 
shadowed area. Aeka watched her a moment then regarded Quistis again.

&quot;It&#39;s not my place, but you did tell me what was going on a little. I 
think you should tell her.&quot;

&quot;Well you see it&#39;s like this...&quot; Quistis started.

&quot;You two look like you&#39;re up to mischief.&quot; Irvine chuckled loudly as he 
strode towards them.

&quot;I&#39;ll tell him at the dance if you do the same.&quot; Aeka said hurriedly as 
Irvine approached. Quistis still couldn&#39;t believe how much she had 
admitted to Aeka and wondered it had been a good idea. However she knew 
Royce and her would be good together, she was willing to go a little out 
of the way for the happiness of her students.

&quot;Alright you have a deal.&quot; Quistis sighed as Irvine lifted her clear off 
the ground in a bear hug and leapt headfirst into the water.

*****************

Seifer awoke to find Squall watching him like hawk. Sitting up he 
laughed gruffly and motioned to the still sleeping Zell.

&quot;Wuss.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;ll be ready when you are.&quot; Squall said cautiously.

&quot;Ready?&quot;

&quot;Whenever you are.&quot;

Luccian stood stoically on the cliff face overlooking the where he and 
Archibald had found the final key. It had been far simpler than he 
suspected.

&quot;You killed him.&quot;

He looked down at the long dagger in his hand, blood still soaked the 
blade and hilt. Luccian frowned quietly at it then tossed it into the 
ocean, were just moments before he&#39;d flung his childhood friend.

&quot;At least he&#39;ll be good for something.&quot; Luccian mumbled then headed for 
the Ragnarok.

&quot;Murderer.&quot;

&quot;Choices to be made, he brought it on himself with the smart ass 
remarks. I warned him.&quot;

&quot;Do you believe that.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Luccian said regretfully and turned to look back to the 
cliff.

&quot;What have I done?&quot;

&quot;What need to be done.&quot; A disembodied voice said to him. It was a 
woman&#39;s voice and he recognized it immediately.

&quot;Why?&quot; Luccian asked, his voice growing shaky as the scope of his 
actions started to close in on him. The shadowed state that of mind that 
enabled his gruesome act quickly seeped away.

&quot;Weakness.&quot; The voice said in disgust. &quot;Not worthy, better to kill you.&quot;

&quot;NO!&quot; Luccian paled. &quot;I- I just want to know why.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; The voice laughed as a shadow appeared before him. The shape 
twisted and swirled until it took a woman&#39;s form. The same woman who had 
attacked him at the first temple, the same woman who had been urging him 
onward.

&quot;A test boy.&quot; The woman said with a wicked smile, before moving towards 
him. She caressed his cheek with rubbed her leg against his. Her beauty 
was of such to drive him mad with lust and fear.

&quot;A test?&quot; He stammered, though terrified, his body responded to her 
touch.

&quot;Kome now, surely you felt the power.&quot; She purred slowly.

&quot;You told me it had to be done to break the seal?&quot; He balked.

&quot;I said nothing.&quot; She chuckled, sliding her fingers down his chest, the 
talons on her fingertips lightly slicing skin and clothing.

&quot;You lie!&quot; He cried out. &quot;In the cave, you told me!&quot;

&quot;All that was in that kave boy! Was what you brought with you.&quot; She 
laughed as her fingers slid teasingly down the front of his pants.

&quot;You used me!&quot; Luccian groaned in a mix of horror and animalistic need.

&quot;No more than used me.&quot; She purred.

&quot;I never used you, I don&#39;t even know you!&quot;

&quot;You used me as an excuse.&quot; She laughed and backed away from him. 
Luccian fell to his knees before her and looked up with tears in his 
eyes. The woman began to glow with an unholy light that he found 
impossible to look away from. The scant clothing she wore melted away 
leaving her naked and glorious. Standing before him like an angry 
goddess, her yellow eyes flashed intensely and she moved towards him. 
With each step the ground cracked and the grass wilted as she passed. 
&quot;As for who I am, I&#39;m you&#39;re destroyer, your seductress, your alpha and 
omega, I am all that you ever knew and all you shall never know. I&#39;m the 
little voice that makes you chase your dreams and kringe from your 
fears. I am Ultimecia.&quot; Luccian felt his mind shattering further into 
madness as her voice echoed within him. He was far to gone to care as 
she wrapped him in an embrace as cold as death and dragged him into 
darkness.

**********

By the time Seifer awoke, Squall and Zell were already up and ready to 
go.

&quot;Early to rise.&quot; Seifer chuckled and held his head. He&#39;d been bonded to 
his guardians for such an extended period now, that loosing them made 
him feel drained and hollow.

&quot;Yeah,yeah, you lunatic time to go.&quot; Zell grumbled.

&quot;Seifer, are you fit for travel.&quot;

&quot;Of course, traveled these paths in far worse condition than this time 
of weakness.&quot; Seifer said proudly.

&quot;Whatever.&quot; Squall sighed and motioned to the exit. &quot;Let&#39;s move.&quot;

&quot;Hold, and devour these. Soon then, all grumbles and urges shall be null 
and gone.&quot; Seifer proclaimed, reaching into a ratty looking wooden box. 
He withdrew a handful of purplish fruits. The fruits had a slightly 
alkaline smell and Zell backed up.

&quot;Oh, hell no.&quot; He said shaking his head in protest.

&quot;We&#39;re fine.&quot; Squall said assuredly, holding up his hand.

&quot;Enough for the three but more for the one, eh!&quot; Seifer laughed rowdily 
and clapped Squall firmly on the back. Squall staggered forward under 
the blow and looked at Seifer in annoyance.

&quot;Can we go.&quot; Zell sighed.

&quot;Seifer.&quot; Squall urged.

&quot;Yes, Yes.&quot; Seifer nodded sinking his teeth into one of the fruits 
before gathering his meager belongings; namely Fujin&#39;s photo and a 
backpack. He then made his way towards the exit with Zell and Squall 
close behind. After squeezing through the opening he greeted the morning 
sun with open arms.

&quot;Fine morning.&quot; He said approvingly as the others followed him out.

&quot;Yeah great.&quot; Zell huffed as Squall handed him Seifer&#39;s gun-blade. &quot;I 
don&#146;t know how to use this thing?&quot;

&quot;Just carry it, he may need it if we&#39;re attacked.&quot; Squall explained.

&quot;Then let him carry it.&quot; Zell argued.

&quot;I&#39;d prefer -not- to give a madman a weapon unless absolutely 
necessary.&quot; Squall said with a bit of finality.

&quot;COME!&quot; Seifer yelled to them, Squall looked up to find the he&#39;d already 
made his way to the cliffs edge.

&quot;Fast bastard.&quot; Zell chuckled.

&quot;Come on.&quot; Squall griped.

By the time they reached him, Seifer was standing impatiently at the 
start of a trail leading down the cliff.

&quot;Down, down to the crests and waves.&quot; He cackled before jogging down the 
path.

&quot;This seems easy enough.&quot; Zell smiled and followed.

Squall knew better to make such assumptions. The trail was an easy 
enough to navigate and soon the three found themselves on a small beach 
strewn with debris from a recent storm.

&quot;Hey man check out the waves.&quot; Zell whistled in delight.

&quot;Leviathans, and worse travel those waters, a fool&#39;s sport would be the 
end of his idiocy.&quot; Seifer smirked to Squall before heading into the 
thick underbrush that ran along the beach&#39;s edge.

&quot;Come on.&quot; Squall called to Zell, who was investigating a titanic 
seashell, ran to catch up.

The journey was a harsh one, full of thick brush and wicked, dagger like 
briars. Thankfully, Seifer&#39;s experience on the island had taught him how 
to avoid most of the island&#39;s more insidious inhabitants. The trip took 
all day and most of the night and by the time the group arrived at their 
destination the three men were a haggard mess. The area was a lagoon of 
sorts, heavily grown over with thick jungle vines and massive tree&#39;s the 
mouth of the lagoon was protected from the brunt of the ocean&#39;s waves by 
tall pillars of natural rock.

&quot;Well?&quot; Squall said hoarsely as he sat atop the shell of a long dead 
tortoise.

&quot;Squall man I don&#39;t feel good.&quot; Zell said blearily.

Seifer stretched and groaned.

&quot;Arrived, not far my path here started.&quot;

Zell staggered past him to retch into the lagoon&#39;s waters.

&quot;Vileness, to be assured, the flies here bring illness and sweats of 
abnormal strength.&quot;

&quot;That just great.&quot; Squall growled. &quot;Zell, you gonna make it?&quot;

Zell gave him the thumbs up from where he knelt at the water&#39;s edge.

&quot;There.&quot; Seifer said, nodding to a pile heavy logs and knotted vines.&quot;

&quot;What the hell is that mess?&quot; Zell groaned.

&quot;Built to skim the waves, held back not by waters fury, fearless of 
storms and class enough for many a woman&#39;s soft visit.&quot; Seifer said with 
a wicked smile.

&quot;Just get us out of here.&quot; Zell gurgled.

Squall went to investigate the heap.

&quot;That better not be some funky raft, there is no way we&#39;re getting to 
the mainland on a raft.&quot; Zell shouted, growing uneasy.

&quot;It&#39;s a boat, a Balamb Jaeger to be specific.&quot; Squall said as he tugged 
at the shell of vegetation.

&quot;Held at bay from storms thieving hands by weighty timbers and iron 
vines.&quot;

Seifer explained proudly.

&quot;How clever.&quot; Squall groused and drew his gun-blade to start hacking at 
the troublesome mass.

&quot;A Jaeger, hey cool that&#39;s what we made the Dollet run in, kick ass!&quot; 
Zell cheered and ran over to help clear it. Seifer, feeling he&#39;d done 
his part kicked back to watch and rest.

End Chapter 47.

 

(Messege to my fans)

I owe you guys a big apology to my indecisiveness last week. I&#39;m certain 
that my re-uploading of chapters was a major hassle to you guys with 
Author Notice. As for the decision to continue the story as is. Contrary 
to what you all may think sometimes this story is about Quistis and 
Fujin. I only wanted to give them a realistic (as realistic as Chocobo&#39;s 
and Mogs can be that is.) world to live in and events and problems to 
deal with together.

If this were only a Quistis and Fujin &quot;alone&quot; story it would get rather 
dull pretty quick. As for my plans for Luccian I think most will be 
pleased with the stage his and the &quot;Thing&quot; under Balamb will soon set. I 
only hope I can continue to bring a little joy to my readers, believe it 
or not you guys do mean a lot to me and I do try to listen to 
suggestions as much as possible. Hence my willingness to expand the 
scenes a of Quistis and Fujin&#39;s growing relationship in previous 
chapters. This will not alter the flow of the story so you can still 
read whats to come without having to know the new additions. I&#39;ll also 
tell what I added to older chapters when I update new ones.

Hugs to all =)

Yours truly
