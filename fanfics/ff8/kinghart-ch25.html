<p align="center">I Thought  I Left You Back There With the Ashes</p>
<p>Selphie and Irvine ran  back to the station, out of breath. A short while later, Xu, Quistis,  Zell and Rinoa also showed up.</p>
<p>“Can’t find him  anywhere!” Zell said angrily. “It’s pissing me off!”</p>
<p>“Anyone find any  witnesses?” Quistis asked.</p>
<p>They all shook their heads. The six of  them stood there, wondering what they were going to do when a little  girl gasped and ran at them.</p>
<p>“H-hey! It’s you!”  She exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Pardon?” Quistis  blinked.</p>
<p>“You guys…you were  with that guy…the one that saved me a while ago!” She tried to  explain.</p>
<p>Selphie was the only one that remembered.</p>
<p>“Oh! You were the  little girl who was playing on those train tracks!” She replied.</p>
<p>The little girl grinned and nodded.</p>
<p>“Have you seen the  man who saved you? His name is Squall.” Quistis asked.</p>
<p>The little  girl thought and then shook her head.</p>
<p>“I didn’t see  him…but when I was running across the bridge…you know, like I did  back then.” She blushed. “I mean…it was only this once. I want  to run across just as the train came…and left…you know…”</p>
<p>“Yes. Go on.”  Quistis urged.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I heard  someone screaming down that way.” She pointed into the tunnel.</p>
<p>The  six of them looked at each other and nodded.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”  Quistis whispered. “But don’t go playing on the tracks anymore.  It’s dangerous.” The little girl smiled.</p>
<p>“Ok! I promise I  won’t anymore.”</p>
<p>Quistis and the others ran down the tunnel.  Whenever a train came, they flattened themselves against the concrete  walls.</p>
<p>“Not fun, not fun,  not fun!” Selphie hissed.</p>
<p>“Quiet!” Xu  snapped. “I think I hear something.”</p>
<p>She jumped away from the  wall and crawled onto the ground.</p>
<p>“Ewww…do you know  what you’re crawling on?” Selphie asked.</p>
<p>Xu didn’t reply. There  were voices coming from the ground.</p>
<p>“Be careful.”  Quistis warned.</p>
<p>Xu crept silently along the dirt and wood until she  reached a large hole in the ground. There, she heard the voices the  clearest.</p>
<p>“I don’t  understand why we have to watch this hole. I keep getting dust in my  eye every time a damned train rolls on by.” A whiny, masculine  voice complained.</p>
<p>“Then wear your  damned goggles!” Another one snarled.</p>
<p>“But they’re too  tight.”</p>
<p>“Then stop your damned complaining! Sheesh, if it  weren’t for the fact that we need guards, I would’ve honestly  shot your head through with bullets.” The meaner one growled.</p>
<p>“Hey, stop that.”  Xu listened even closer.</p>
<p>She had to neutralize both of them as fast  as possible.</p>
<p>“Xu! There’s a  train coming!” Quistis hissed.</p>
<p>Xu kept listening. She could  estimate their positions pretty well. They were pretty close  together, close enough that her weapon could reach the other in time.  And then she heard another set of footsteps. It was carefully hidden  but she had been trained to hear the slightest bit of noise. So that  was their plan…get talking, make anyone outside think that there  were only two. Xu smirked and dove into the hole. Their faces showed  surprise, but not shock. They were expecting someone to try and  ambush them.</p>
<p>Xu dispatched one when  she fell through. She used gravity and precise landing to knock the  first one out cold. As soon as she landed, she pushed off, jump  kicking the second one to the head. The third one steadied his aim  but before he could fire, Xu swung her whole weapon, disarming him  and taking a good slice at his arm as well. She neutralized him with  another attack to the head. She waited until the next train went on  by before climbing up the wall and poking her head out.</p>
<p>“It’s safe guys!”  She whispered and the others followed her into the tunnel.</p>
<p>“Sheesh, who knew  Timber had so many secrets.” Selphie remarked.</p>
<p>Xu shushed her again  and they made their way down the tunnel. Around the corner, Xu took  out two more guards with finesse.</p>
<p>“Jeez, I thought I  had skill. We should fight sometime.” Zell whistled.</p>
<p>“Your combat is  different from mine.” Xu replied. “Your moves are blatantly  offensive.”</p>
<p>“WHAT? Hey! I’ll  have you know my skills don’t offend any…”</p>
<p>“I mean, yours  are blatant attacks.” Xu corrected. “Mine are more geared towards  covert operations.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” Zell hung  his head sheepishly.</p>
<p>“But if you want, we  can trade secrets.” Xu offered and Zell perked up almost instantly.</p>
<p>“That’d be cool!”</p>
<p>They made their way  down the halls, meeting little or no resistance. Xu captured one and  forced him to tell her where they kept Squall. As they made their way  down that hall, something caught Xu’s eye and she froze.</p>
<p>“Damned lock won’t  bust open.” Irvine hissed.</p>
<p>He had done some lock picking back in  his day, mainly as a younger boy to break into the girl’s lockers  and stay there as a peeping tom. But his skills had somewhat  deteriorated since then.</p>
<p>“SQUALL?” Rinoa  shouted, banging on the door. “Squall are you in there?”</p>
<p>Inside, Squall heard  the banging and the muffled voices, one of them clearly Rinoa. He  struggled against the chains.</p>
<p>“Rinoa! I’m in  here!” He yelled back.</p>
<p>“He’s in there!”  Rinoa exclaimed gleefully. Irvine finally grew tired of his inability  to pick the lock and blasted it open with his gun.</p>
<p>“Squall!” Rinoa  flung herself into his embrace.</p>
<p>“Xu?” Quistis  asked just as she was about to enter the cell as well. Xu didn’t  reply. Instead, she started walking down the hall. “Xu! Where are  you going? It’s like a maze down there!”</p>
<p>Xu ran down the hall,  turning at every corner she could. Quistis followed as closely as  possible.</p>
<p>“We’ve been down  here before.” Quistis said. “There’s nothing down here!” But  the brunette kept running. Soon, Quistis lost track of where they  were.</p>
<p>“See? Now we’re  lost.” She sighed. “What’s gotten into you?” Xu looked  around.</p>
<p>The slimy, moldy stone walls had gradually changed. It was  cleaner, more modern. She continued down that way until she found an  open door. The two walked inside. It was an empty office. There was a  simple wooden desk with two chairs, a plant in the corner, a couch  and a water dispenser. Xu walked over to the desk and opened each of  the drawers up. There was nothing inside.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”  Quistis commented, lifting up the couch a little to get a look at  what was underneath.</p>
<p>Xu looked around warily and followed her.</p>
<p>“There’s really  nothing here, if there was something you were looking for.”</p>
<p>Xu stopped cold. She  readied her weapon.</p>
<p>“I sent all the good  soldiers off to our base. I really have no use for the Leonhart boy.  He’s served his purpose quite well.” Quistis stood outside, Xu  inside.</p>
<p>The door gently swung so that it was parallel to Xu. The  person on the other side of the door walked until Xu could see her  back. It was the woman in purple.</p>
<p>“What purpose?” Xu  demanded.</p>
<p>“What purpose?”  The woman repeated. “Well, I suppose luck is a part of it. Really,  how did I know whether you’d come or not? It’s the fates, I  guess. Hyne is looking out for us.” She turned around.</p>

<em>“Hyne’ll look  out for us. Don’t worry.”</em>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<em>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
</em>
</p>
<p>“Xu…Xu, what’s  wrong?” Quistis took a step forward only to have the door slam shut  in her face. Xu locked the door.</p>
<p>“At least you still  remember me. I was afraid that I had become one of those lost  memories, insignificant.”</p>
<p>“You’re dead. I  saw you murdered. I saw you! I saw you bleed to death! I saw them! I  saw the knives. They stabbed you!”</p>
<p>“In more ways than  one, yes.”</p>
<p>“How can you joke  about this? HOW? YOU’RE DEAD! I saw the whole thing!” Xu  screamed. “You’re not here. You’re some kind of illusion, or  someone…someone…”</p>
<p>“We can get a DNA  test later if you want. I assure you, Xu, I’m very much alive. What  you saw was real, yes. But what happened after? What happened to the  body? Was I really dead when you last saw me? I know Shiva took you  away. That was my last request to her. But did you know I had another  GF junctioned?”</p>
<p>Her eyes glowed white  as she summoned a GF. The GF was horrifying, with her thin body  wrapped in bloody bandages, her fingers more like curved blades than  finger. Her arms were extended well past her knees and her grin only  showed red sharp teeth.</p>
<p>“This is Succubus.  She was with me at the time of my apparent death. She sustained most  of the damage, albeit, it showed on my body. Rest assured I was  critically wounded, in fact, I didn’t think I would make it.” She  dismissed Succubus.</p>
<p>She took off her jacket and began unbuttoning her  shirt. Xu stood watching, unfazed. She peeled back the white sides to  reveal several scars along her chest and stomach.</p>
<p>“Becca…?” Xu  whispered, finally beginning to believe.</p>
<p>“Hyne really was  looking out for both of us that day.”</p>
<p>“XU! XU OPEN THIS  DOOR!” Quistis yelled.</p>
<p>Becca looked at the door in amusement.</p>
<p>“So, who’s that  girl? Is that the famous Quistis Trepe?”</p>
<p>“What’s going on?  Why did you kidnap Squall? Why do you want his ring? What happened to  you after that incident?” Xu asked, ignoring her question. “There  are so many questions I want to ask you Becca. Are you evil? Are you  working for evil?”</p>
<p>“What would you do  if I am?” She replied coolly.</p>
<p>Xu clenched her fists and closed her  eyes to prevent the tears from spilling.</p>
<p>“Hyne…I don’t  know. I might have to stop you, or kill you, I don’t know! I  thought you were dead all these years.” She said, her voice  wavering.</p>
<p>Becca’s face softened and she walked over to Xu and put  her arms around her. Xu pushed her away.</p>
<p>“No. No.” She  wiped her eyes.</p>
<p>“Xu, I can assure  you, I’m not evil. I’m not working for anyone evil. But I think  we may have made a mistake, something we intend to fix.”</p>
<p>“And you need me?”  Xu finished.</p>
<p>“No. I <em>want</em> you.” She replied.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I’ve searched  everywhere for you. I searched all the towns, all the little nooks  and crannies. But I didn’t search the Gardens. I didn’t once  think that the little girl I looked after, that shy, timid little  girl would grow up one day to be this strong, proud and beautiful  SeeD. I started searching for you before I could walk again. And when  I could walk, I went back to that orphanage, that hell that we grew  up in and burned it to the ground. I took all the kids back to the  base and they grew up to be fine men and women. Now I want you to  come back.” Becca explained.</p>
<p>“Are you real?” Xu  touched her face.</p>
<p>“I can understand if  you decline. I can fade away, become insignificant.”</p>
<p>“No, Becca. You were  the most significant person in my life. But I can’t just leave…I  have people I care about, people I love.”</p>
<p>“Come with me for a  few days. See what we’re doing, just humor me for a little while,  we can catch up on the past few years. Most importantly, just…just  be with me again.”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“Quistis!” Irvine  and the others caught up with her. Quistis was pounding on the door,  even body slamming it but it wouldn’t budge.</p>
<p>“Xu is in there!”  She shouted.</p>
<p>“Only one way to  handle a locked door.” Irvine shot the lock again. Quistis burst  into the room.</p>
<p>“XU!” The room was  empty. “Xu, where are you?” Squall walked over to the desk where  a solitary paper lay. He scanned over it.</p>
<p>“Quistis.” He  said, motioning for to come closer. She went over and picked up the  paper.</p>
<p><em>Dear Quistis,</em></p>
<p><em>I promise you, I’m  writing this out of my own volition. I’m doing this because I chose  to. There’s a lot I can’t explain right now, either to you or  myself. Please, please wait for me, I promise I’ll come home. And  when I do, I’ll understand everything, I’ll have all the answers  that both of us have been seeking. I love you. Know that I would  never hurt you. And tell everyone I’m sorry I can’t explain why  I’m leaving.</em></p>
<p><em>Xu</em></p>
<p>“What does it say,  Quisty?” Selphie asked.</p>
<p>“She’s…she’s  taking a little bit of a trip. She says she’s sorry she can’t  explain to you why.” Quistis replied.</p>
<p>“Are you ok…?”  Rinoa placed her hand on Quistis’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“I’m fine. I trust  her.” She turned around. “How’s your head, Squall?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine.” He  said.</p>
<p>“Alright, we should  head back to the Garden then.” Quistis announced. “Even if you  say it’s fine, you better get Dr. Kadowaki to look at that.”</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t we look  for her?” Selphie asked. The tall blond shrugged.</p>
<p>“I told you, I trust  her.”</p>
<p>Squall leaned against Rinoa and they shuffled out. Quistis  cast one last look at the room before following. She had a strange  feeling that she wouldn’t be seeing Xu for a long time to come.</p>
