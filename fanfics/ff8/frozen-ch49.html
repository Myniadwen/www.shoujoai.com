Seifer paced back and forth in his room. He was furious; Squall placed 
him under house arrest until Edea returned to evaluate his condition. 
Until that time he was stuck. Two armed guards stood outside his door, 
he knew if he wanted to press the point he could just overpower them but 
that would do little to prove his good intentions. Deciding to make the 
best of his situation he went into the bathroom to shave.

**************

&quot;You left earlier without saying anything.&quot; Quistis said quietly as she 
walked into Fujin&#39;s quarters. They had given each other keys a few weeks 
ago. &quot;A sign that things are getting serious.&quot; Quistis had joked.

She knew Fujin was here somewhere, she always returned home when she 
sought solitude.

&quot;Perhaps I should let her have it. I mean, Seifer, what a shock.&quot; 
Quistis mused. It was dimmer than usual and she had trouble maneuvering 
through the silk draperies than hung artfully in the air.

&quot;I brought you something.&quot; She said playfully, dangling a bag in hand 
and hiding the other behind her.

&quot;Fu?&quot; She called again.

Sure enough, like a spider at the heart of her web, Fujin sat quietly 
atop her bed. Quistis smiled fondly and approached her.

&quot;Hey Angel, I missed you earlier.&quot;

Fujin looked up dully and offered a hollow smirk. Quistis frowned, 
slightly hurt.

&quot;I brought you something.&quot; She tried again. Holding out the small bag 
she carried, she then revealed a bundle of white roses. Quietly Fujin 
took the offerings and smiled, albeit a small, almost sad one. Quistis&#39;s 
heart sank; she wasn&#39;t used to this from her and didn&#39;t know how to 
react.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Quistis asked softly.

&quot;NOTHING.&quot; Fujin mumbled.

&quot;Don&#39;t say that, I know better.&quot;

Fujin shrugged and rubbing her eye with her palm.

&quot;Fujin!?&quot; Quistis frowned, recognizing that particular sign of distress. 
Sighting down she regarded her friend and lover with worry.

&quot;It&#39;s Seifer coming back, I know how that must hurt. I&#39;m here for you 
love, you know that.&quot; She whispered quietly. Fujin nodded solemnly, her 
expression sullen. Quistis tiled her head in dismay.

&quot;Fu.&quot; She sighed softly.

Fujin moved forward, tentatively, before quietly resting her head in 
Quistis&#39;s lap. Quistis said nothing, but simply held her tenderly. She 
frowned inwardly; Fujin was always somewhat vague about her relationship 
with Seifer. Thinking back she realized she knew little about their 
relationship, beside the fact Seifer was insensitive at times and that 
she had loved him even if he didn&#39;t return it. Not wanting to push the 
point at the moment, she settled on comforting Fujin, who sniffled 
quietly against her.

***********

&quot;I can&#39;t believe all this mess started over this lil guy.&quot; Nicole 
breathed motherly, hold up the squirming little dragon.

&quot;Yeah, well. I told you I&#39;m sorry. Hell I know Squall will never go 
anywhere with me again.&quot; Zell laughed, sticking his foam-covered face 
out of the bathroom. &quot;By the way, I think it&#39;s a girl.&quot;

&quot;How do you know?&quot; Nicole grinned as the tiny creature snapped playfully 
at her.

&quot;A mother knows.&quot; Zell chuckled as he started to shave.

&quot;Mother, shyeah right.&quot; Nicole laughed rolling her eyes.

&quot;Hey now.&quot; Zell said defensively, wagging the foam-laden razor at her. 
&quot;I kept that egg warm for nearly three weeks. She hatched in my care, so 
yeah I&#39;m her mom.&quot; He proclaimed proudly.

&quot;That&#146;s just sick, daddy maybe, not mommy. By the way you&#39;re dripping 
that mess on the carpet.&quot; Nicole said cynically.

Scoffing indignantly he went back in the bathroom.

&quot;I think you should&#39;ve kept the beard it makes you look distinguished.&quot;

Nicole called thoughtfully.

&quot;Beard, smeard, I look like a dork.&quot; Zell snorted. &quot;You want a beard so 
bad grow one.&quot;

Nicole laughed aloud at the thought.

&quot;My aunt had one, perhaps I could.&quot; She joked.

&quot;Oh gross!&quot; Zell shouted.

Nicole smiled ear from ear, thankful to have him back.

*************


&quot;I can&#39;t believe all of this mess started because of some silly dragon.&quot; 
Rinoa grumbled, petting Angelo, who was mouthing her hand for attention.

&quot;Zell said he was sorry. Still I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be joining him on any 
of his excursions anytime soon.&quot; Squall said, sticking his head out of 
the bathroom. &quot;You meant well.&quot; Rinoa grinned as Angelo snapped 
playfully at her.

&quot;I guess. It was still a hassle.&quot; Squall sighed as he started to trim 
his new beard.

&quot;Shyeah right. You know you had fun, danger, adventure, oh lets not for 
get intrigue. Who would&#39;ve guessed you&#39;d run into Seifer.&quot; Rinoa growled 
rolling her eyes.

&quot;I&#39;ll have you know.&quot; Squall said defensively pointing the electric 
razor at her. &quot;I was thinking of you the whole time.&quot; He proclaimed.

&quot;Un huh. By the way, you&#39;re not keeping that beard are you?&quot; Rinoa said 
cynically. Scoffing indignantly Squall went back in the bathroom.

&quot;I think I&#39;ll keep it. I think it makes me look distinguished.&quot; He said 
thoughtfully.

&quot;Beard, smeard, It makes you look like a dork.&quot; Rinoa snorted.&quot;

&quot;Fine, Fine, I&#39;ll shave the beard. Squall chuckled.&quot;

Rinoa grew quiet and recalled how she nearly fainted when she saw Squall 
being pulled aboard the ship, alongside the hairy, half-naked lunatic 
that called itself Seifer. She tried to talk to Squall about the whole 
misadventure but he refused to speak of it, saying he only wanted to go 
home.

&quot;So what are you going to do about him?&quot; Rinoa asked, growing serious.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, the whole thing stinks.&quot; Squall sighed

&quot;Are you sure the this house arrest thing is a good idea? I mean he 
-did- save your life.&quot;

&quot;I know, but the fact remains, he&#39;s a insane and a potential loose 
cannon. If he behaves until Edea gets back then we&#39;ll reevaluate. Don&#39;t 
forget though he did have a large part in the events at Trabia, people 
died. He&#39;s just lucky no one from here was killed.&quot;

&quot;You hate him don&#39;t you.&quot; Rinoa said softly.

&quot;Actually, no.&quot; Squall sighed, sticking his half-shaven face out of the 
bathroom.

&quot;I think Edea played him, Seifer&#39;s many things but not a cold blooded 
killer.&quot;

&quot;You believe that.&quot; Rinoa blinked in surprise.

&quot;To a degree.&quot; Squall shrugged. &quot;Don&#39;t tell him that though.&quot;

&quot;Nor Selphie, she&#39;d never talk to you again.&quot; Rinoa warned.

&quot;Oh he should be held accountable, that much is certain, he&#39;s lucky Cid 
didn&#146;t do anything the first time he came back.&quot;

&quot;Why didn&#39;t he?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, I think he was tired of all the fighting and just hoped 
Seifer would go his own way eventually.&quot;

&quot;Well now he&#39;s back.&quot;

&quot;Yeah I know and proclaiming his love for Fujin.&quot;

&quot;Oh that&#146;s rich, perhaps we&#39;ll be lucky and he&#39;ll carry her off.&quot;

&quot;You need to get over that.&quot; Squall said firmly.

&quot;What!?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s tiresome, Fujin is trying to make amends, she hasn&#39;t done anything 
to you.&quot;

&quot;She damn near broke my nose.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, true.&quot; Squall stammered, not wanting to tell her that she 
probably deserved it.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, I guess I can try.&quot; Rinoa mumbled.

&quot;That&#146;s all I&#39;m asking. She&#39;s not going anywhere I don&#146;t think. So it&#39;s 
best to just deal with it. You and Quistis used to be close until this 
started up.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s the point.&quot; Rinoa nodded importantly.

&quot;Just let it go, I&#39;m seriously tired of all this bickering, we&#39;re not 
children anymore.&quot;

Rinoa hung her head. &quot;You&#39;re right.&quot;

Squall frowned; he didn&#146;t struggle to come back alive to get in a 
argument.

&quot;Let&#39;s do something tonight after the briefing&quot; He said, oddly cheery.

&quot;What?&quot; Rinoa blinked in surprise.

&quot;Just you an me, something romantic.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t be serious.&quot; Rinoa laughed.

&quot;Never more so.&quot; Squall assured her.

&quot;Alright.&quot; Rinoa grinned.

&quot;Great.&quot; Squall smiled as he returned to shaving. Rinoa squeaked with 
glee and hugged Angelo tightly.

*********************

Everyone had begun to gather on the bridge to hear Quistis&#39;s and 
Squall&#39;s debriefing. Seifer was there also, newly groomed and 
clean-shaven. He either didn&#39;t notice or didn&#39;t care to acknowledge the 
openly venomous stare Selphie was giving him. Squall was thankful the 
girl had kept herself from the get go. The last to arrive were Fujin and 
Irvine both of who carried folders. Seifer lit up like a beacon as Fujin 
walked onto the bridge and she nearly turned back upon seeing him. 
Resisting the urge she handed her folder to Quistis while Irvine handed 
his to Xu.

&quot;Alright.&quot; Squall said getting everyone&#39;s attention. &quot;As you all know, 
three weeks ago Zell and I left Balamb aboard the Ragnarok. We then 
proceeded to transport Luccian Czar to Dollet. After which, we traveled 
to the isle of hell. While we where there, someone stole the Ragnarok 
and left us marooned.&quot;

&quot;And so the wayward sons were lost and useless, The forgotten one, 
myself, he the wayward knight brought them out of darkness, this and 
more to rescue the helpless.&quot; Seifer babbled proudly.

All eyes turned to him in shock. That is, all eyes except Squall and 
Zell who only exchanged glances.

&quot;You got to pardon the Seif man. He&#39;s out of his gourd.&quot; Zell chuckled.

Seifer moved towards him with a growl but checked himself and merely 
smiled instead.

&quot;Right, to say.&quot; Seifer smirked tapping his temple. &quot;Wit&#39;s sharp as 
talon&#39;s, mind keen as blade, this day, and many past through, have been 
muddled to speech, though harmless, perhaps, or no?&quot; He babbled 
laughingly.

Fujin bristled; she didn&#39;t buy any of it.

&quot;Anyway!&quot; Squall said sharply getting everyone back on track. &quot;As you 
already know, we encountered Seifer who aided us by taking us to a 
ship.&quot;

&quot;Which was a piece of crap, it took me nearly a week to get it running!&quot; 
Zell grumbled bitterly. Quistis placed a hand on his shoulder to settle 
him.

&quot;After roughly seven days in the water, Xu&#39;s team picked us up. Now is 
everyone clear so far?&quot;

Zell bounced up and down raising his hand. Squall sighed.

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;How did they find us man, in the heat of it all I never asked.&quot;

&quot;Good question. Xu, you want to answer that one.&quot; Squall said gesturing 
for the woman to step forward.

&quot;Nida and I intercepted the homing beacon, it was altered to broadcast a 
message in binary. At first we thought you guys did it.&quot; Xu blinked.

&quot;No, we lost all contact with the ship after it was stolen.&quot; Squall 
admitted.

&quot;We&#39;ll Fujin and I searched the ship and could find no reason for the 
beacon being altered, other than the possibility of the thieves doing 
it.&quot;

&quot;Weird man, weird. So we recovered her intact then?&quot; Zell beamed 
eagerly.

&quot;Who?&quot; Quistis asked.

&quot;The Ragnarok!&quot; Zell said hopefully.

&quot;Yes, but the ship is badly damaged. There was a fire on the bridge and 
it apparently crashed. The flight recorder and internal security systems 
were also demolished. The technicians believe she&#39;ll need to be 
scrapped. &quot; Quistis answered sadly.

&quot;Oh damn it, damn it, damn it!&quot; Zell shouted in outrage, hopping about 
in a fit. Nicole hurried to quiet him down and console him. Nida moved 
to say something but Zell&#39;s outburst quieted him. Squall watched Zell a 
moment then sighed.

&quot;Okay, do we have any idea&#39;s who stole the ship?&quot;

Quistis shook her head.

&quot;Seifer, was anyone else on the island with you.&quot;

&quot;Though glorious, he is, mortal however and omnipotent is not, though if 
I had ventured upon a lost soul, surely reimburse such the encounter, 
nothing forgotten no matter how trite.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Squall snapped.

&quot;No.&quot; Seifer said simply.

Squall tensed for a moment but settled. He then turned to Quistis.

&quot;Where was the ship found?&quot; Squall asked.

&quot;Near Odin&#39;s tower.&quot; Quistis answered, calling up the map. &quot;About here.&quot; 
She said pointing to the area.

&quot;That&#39;s out in the middle of no where.&quot; He frowned.

&quot;Any clues who did this.&quot; Zell growled.

&quot;PERHAPS.&quot; Fujin said simply.

Everyone looked at her curiously as she pulled a tattered black trench 
coat out a plastic bag.

&quot;Members of my class found it near the site.&quot; Quistis said quietly.

&quot;THAT MOTHER!&quot; Zell roared, ready to spiral into a stream of curses that 
were biblical in proportions. Nicole clamped a hand over his mouth, 
wincing. &quot;Aeka and Royce claim that is was similar to Luccian&#39;s&quot; Quistis 
commented. &quot;Judging by Zell&#39;s reaction, I believe they are right.&quot;

&quot;Thought so.&quot; Squall soured.

&quot;He must have stowed.&quot; Zell barked.

&quot;Probably, then waited for us to leave the ship then flew off.&quot; Squall 
said, folding his arms.

&quot;Now, Cid&#39;s been in contact with him since you guys vanished though.&quot; 
Rinoa piped in.

&quot;Anyone trace the call?&quot; Zell asked.

&quot;I dunno.&quot; Rinoa shrugged.

Zell charged off the bridge to the elevator.

&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Quistis yelled.

&quot;Cid&#39;s office.&quot; Zell shouted.

&quot;Whoa, Hey now!&quot; Xu shouted chasing after him.

&quot;Damn it Zell.&quot; Squall grumbled following them.

&quot;Um guys.&quot; Nida waved trying to get everyone&#39;s attention but was wholly 
ignored as everyone piled into the elevator. Upon reaching Cid&#39;s office 
Zell rushed behind his desk and started tampering with the COMM system.

&quot;Stop right there!&quot; Xu ordered.

&quot;Zell!&quot; Squall shouted as Zell turned on Cid&#39;s computer.

Zell sighed and looked up. &quot;Don&#39;t you see, perhaps Cid had him traced!&quot; 
Zell said eagerly.

&quot;I don&#39;t care, just wait until Cid gets back.&quot; Xu said firmly.

&quot;Worry more and more, circles run, trouble to fret about is what she 
plans, and scheme of things.&quot; Seifer shouted gleefully.

&quot;Shut up.&quot; Squall snapped.

&quot;It&#39;s not his fault.&quot; Quistis said quietly though she hated taking up 
for him.

&quot;What!?&quot; Selphie gawked at her.

&quot;I agree with Squall!&quot; Zell shouted. &quot;Seifer shut the hell up!&quot;

&quot;Everyone calm down.&quot; Irvine said coolly, gesturing to everyone.

&quot;Calm down, you didn&#39;t have to put up with that lunatics gibberish for 
three weeks.&quot; Zell growled. Rinoa looked back and forth uncomprehending, 
she was beginning to feel out of place. It seemed to her that everyone 
knew their role and filled it. While she was just an ignorant observer. 
With a sigh she sat down and quietly listened.

Fujin, who stayed behind with Nida quietly shook her head as the yelling 
intensified. Then with suddenly, all was quiet.

&quot;Here we go.&quot; Nida chuckled.

&quot;What in the world are you all doing in my office!&quot; Cid shouted in 
mixture of shock and anger.

Fujin&#39;s eye widened in surprise as she looked at Nida.

&quot;I tried to tell them.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Since hearing of the trouble Cid 
asked Laguna to have a jet pick them up from Trabia. They docked about 
ten minutes ago.&quot;

Fujin smirked faintly as a quagmire of voices rang out trying to offer 
explanations.

Cid stood in the doorway of his office with a look of complete and utter 
disappointment. Edea peered over his shoulder with a quietly amused 
expression.

&quot;Old man, welcome again to abode, this understood to run amok with 
purpose and yet, without reason, however, somewhat joyous occasion to 
bear witness again of he and the lady of previous endeavors of ill but 
no more.&quot; Seifer shouted graciously.

Cid&#39;s eyes boggled, suddenly noticing him. Edea, however seemed unmoved 
and merely squeezed past to hug Seifer, Squall and Zell warmly.

&quot;Greetings children, welcome home.&quot; She said smoothly. Seifer seemed 
taken aback as did Selphie who looked about ready to burst. Irvine 
draped her arms over her small shudders and hugged her back against him. 
Squall and Zell however took the embrace graciously and smiled at her.

&quot;Sir, sorry about the intrusion.&quot; Squall mumbled.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, I&#39;m just glad you boys made it back. What happened.&quot; Cid 
asked, pressing past the crowd to get to his desk. Seifer watched Edea 
quietly, his eyes glazing as she moved to stand behind her husband.

Zell stepped forward eagerly; drawing curious looks from everyone.

&quot;Well Cid man, it&#39;s a long story, but to keep it quick. Did you happen 
to have a trace to where Luccian was at when you called?&quot; He said 
hopefully.

&quot;Cid man?&quot; Cid mouthed as if tasting something bad.

&quot;Zell.&quot; Xu whispered harshly elbowing the blonde rebel.

&quot;Sorry sir.&quot; Quistis sighed. &quot;We have reason to believe Luccian had a 
hand in all of this.&quot;

&quot;Luccian, as in Luccian Czar, your student?&quot; Cid said skeptically.

&quot;Yes sir, Quistis discovered his coat in the wreckage of the Ragnarok.&quot;

&quot;Wreckage!?&quot; Cid sputtered.

&quot;Yeah man they busted her up, the ass wipes!&quot; Zell cried out in dismay 
earning another firm elbow from Xu.

&quot;I see, well I called him at the number he left. I got his associate&#39;s 
in Dollet and they patched me through to him. I assumed he was there 
somewhere.&quot;

Cid said apologetically.

&quot;Have you tried again?&quot; Squall asked.

&quot;The other day, but I was told he was inspecting a factory in the 
mountains.&quot;

&quot;Gah! Can you try again and let me see if I can run a trace?&quot; Zell 
pleaded.

&quot;I can try but he hasn&#39;t returned any calls.&quot; Cid sighed. &quot;First though 
I have a question.&quot; He said with a polite smile.

&quot;Yes sir?&quot; Squall said attentively.

&quot;Where in the word did you pick up Seifer.&quot; Cid blurted completely 
dumbfounded. Selphie giggled. An awkward and somewhat disturbing giggle 
that made everyone look at her.

&quot;Sorry.&quot; She smiled weirdly through clenched teeth.

&quot;I think we&#39;re going to head out, she feeling under the weather.&quot; Irvine 
explained with a grim grin.

&quot;What?&quot; Rinoa started.

Irvine cut a glance to Seifer who was staring oddly the two of them.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Rinoa said quietly, giving them a knowing look as they exited the 
office. Sensing potential trouble Quistis took control of the 
conversation.

&quot;Squall and Zell were marooned on the isle hell, there they encountered 
Seifer who helped them off the island. We also found the Ragnarok near 
Odin&#39;s tower.&quot; She said in a hurried and brief explanation of events.

&quot;Okay.&quot; Cid nodded, accepting that explanation for now.

&quot;Call?&quot; Zell said again eagerly.

&quot;Calm, down.&quot; Xu whispered to him firmly.

&quot;Yes, yes, lets get this over with. I feel this is going to be a long 
night.&quot; Cid sighed. &quot;Zell set up you&#39;re trace then and I&#39;ll make the 
call.&quot;

&quot;Excellent!&quot; Zell clapped then proceeded to plug the COMM line into 
Cid&#39;s computer.

&quot;That was the easy part, let me call up some software right quick.&quot; Zell 
mumbled as he fished around the Balamb&#39;s database.

&quot;Squall dear, I would like to speak with you and Seifer while they set 
up their device.&quot; Edea said breezily.

Squall nodded and looked to Seifer who moved to follow. Edea quietly 
lead them to the sitting room outside Cid&#39;s office.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Squall asked.

&quot;I notice Seifer, that you seem to be, somewhat preoccupied and 
unfocused.&quot; She said with a hint of worry to the tall youth.

&quot;Know of such more and yet less, or even more than one would see, but I 
of course, see also the mind of the all and none, to such degree it 
wreaks chaos to one and true self but digress such is minor to he now of 
then.&quot; Seifer shrugged.

&quot;I gathered as much.&quot; Edea nodded then looked to Squall. &quot;How long has 
he been like this?&quot;

Squall looked baffled and shrugged. &quot;He was like this when we found him. 
What&#39;s wrong with him?&quot;

&quot;I do not know for certain child although I have a possible idea to the 
cause.&quot; Edea frowned.

&quot;I figured he&#39;d gone crazy from being on the island.&quot; Squall sighed.

&quot;Seifer you were not like this during our last meeting. What have you 
been doing in this time?&quot; Edea asked, even though she had some knowledge 
already.

&quot;To and hear, for he has witness and seen much to the end of heaven and 
hell and more to search to amend. Have such to come far. What past to 
happen with her most foul, yet lost and searching I. Then found, she 
called and once more to her I dwell and leave in such state to go mad as 
say to try to halt her to pause to slay but fail.&quot; He said in such a 
flurry that it made Squall&#39;s head hurt to even listen much less 
decipher. With a sigh he looked at Edea helplessly.

&quot;He&#39;s been talking that gibberish nonstop. We can make sense of it 
sometimes, but for the most part. Well you can guess.&quot;

Edea nodded and frowned at Seifer.

&quot;The, she, you are referring to, is Ultimecia.&quot; She stated bluntly.

Seifer nodded unable to speak her name. Squall suddenly felt ill and sat 
down.

&quot;How did you contact her.&quot; Edea asked.

&quot;More like how and why? First off she&#39;s dead and secondly you maniac 
she&#39;s evil what where you thinking.&quot; Squall nearly shouted as a jumble 
of foul memories flooded back to him.

&quot;Calm yourself child.&quot; Edea gestured, laying a hand against Squall 
chest.

&quot;He was attempting to make amends somehow. It is hard to understand 
right now, his mind is in shambles.&quot;

Seifer straightened proudly and smiled.

&quot;One of past thrall to her I was, speak now correct. Past to place and 
he that you, as to more importantly her, the winter, the love. To 
amends, to correct to stop.&quot; He proclaimed with a sincere look.

Squall looked at Edea in confusion.

&quot;Translation?&quot;

&quot;He wants to make amends, as I said. He also wishes to make amends to 
someone he holds dear.&quot;

&quot;That would be Fujin.&quot; Squall sighed.

Edea arched a brow but remained silent.

&quot;What was he talking about? What about Ultimecia?&quot;

&quot;I believe he encountered her shadow.&quot; Edea said cryptically.

&quot;Her shadow?&quot; Squall repeated skeptically.

&quot;More of a phantom self, a fragment of her spirit or mind.&quot; Edea 
explained.

&quot;Is this going to be problem?&quot;

&quot;All that depends on what has happened, child.&quot;

&quot;Seifer, what did you do this time.&quot; Squall sighed and rubbed his 
forehead.

&quot;Spoke of this while stayed, once and more, but listen to the knight, 
no!&quot; Seifer snapped pointing at Squall, who promptly looked at Edea with 
growing exasperation.

&quot;Can you.&quot; He made a face, trying to find an appropriate word. &quot;Fix 
him?&quot; He tried. Edea eyed Seifer thoughtfully.

&quot;Perhaps, the shadow has shattered his mind it will be difficult.&quot;

&quot;Why would she do that and not try to kill him?&quot;

&quot;Knowledge is power, while he and I were under Ultimecia&#39;s thrall we 
shared a unique rapport with her. She knew our thoughts and to a degree 
we knew hers. As for killing him, I do not know why it spared him.&quot;

&quot;This is sounding bad.&quot; Squall sighed, leaning against the wall. &quot;So 
what does it want?&quot;

&quot;There could be a number of things the shadow was assigned to do.&quot; Edea 
frowned slightly.

&quot;Assigned?&quot; Squall blinked curiously.

&quot;Think of it as a golem or sentry of a sort. It remains at its post 
until an outside event causes it to act in a prearranged manner.&quot; Edea 
said with a mystical flourish. Seifer bobbed his head eagerly in 
agreement.

&quot;Okay then, Seifer set it off looking for her.&quot; Squall said giving him 
an accusing look.

&quot;Yes but until he can better express himself we will not know the full 
scope of the matter.&quot; Edea said sadly.

&quot;Wonderful.&quot; Squall grumbled. &quot;You&#39;ll try and help him then?&quot;

&quot;I will make the attempt.&quot; Edea smiled quietly.

Meanwhile back in Cid&#39;s office Zell&#39;s modifications were set. Cid sat 
patiently as he waited for someone to pick up his call. Finally a dreary 
sounding voice answered the line.

&quot;Czar Industries, I&#39;m Rosco how can I help you.&quot;

&quot;Yes I&#39;m Cid Kramer of Balamb Garden, I&#39;m trying to reach Luccian Czar.&quot;

&quot;Lou?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Um he&#39;s still up in the mountains, okay hold on, lemmi see if I can 
patch ya through.&quot;

Zell bounced eagerly in anticipation. Cid just rolled his eyes in 
annoyance as a rickety and hollow sounding tune started playing. Several 
long tedious moments past before finally the line clicked.

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Luccian said, his voice sounding gravely as if sick.

&quot;Luccian?&quot; Cid blinked, not expecting him to answer.

&quot;Headmaster Cid?&quot;

&quot;Um yes, we just wanted to let you know we found Squall and Zell.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s nice.&quot; Luccian droned.

&quot;How&#39;s you&#39;re father doing?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been in the mountains, I haven&#39;t seen him for a few weeks.&quot;

&quot;Ah understood, how much longer do you need?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be returning, there&#39;s a strong likelihood father 
will be dead soon.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to hear that. What about Archibald?&quot;

&quot;He won&#39;t be returning either.&quot;

&quot;Is there anything you need us to help with?&quot;

&quot;Tell Miss Trepe I&#39;ll miss her class.&quot; Luccian said with an eerie 
unpleasantness.

&quot;I&#39;ll do that, well it&#39;s late there so I&#39;m sure you&#39;re about ready to 
call it a night.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir.&quot;

&quot;Very well then, you have a good night, my prayers go with you and your 
father.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure, farewell sir.&quot;

&quot;Bye.&quot; Cid said and hung up then looked at Zell expectantly. &quot;Well?&quot;

&quot;Damn it, I was sure he was the one.&quot; Zell snarled in annoyance.

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis frowned.

&quot;The trace checked out, the call was clean.&quot; Zell sighed. &quot;I even made 
sure to see if it was being bounced around.&quot;

&quot;You know it&#39;s possible the coat was just left and thrown from the 
wreckage or that the real thieves left it.&quot; Xu offered thoughtfully.

&quot;We&#39;ll find out eventually. Zell, perhaps you can get some clue&#39;s from 
the Ragnarok something in the computer we missed?&quot; Quistis asked.

&quot;I hope so, is she in the hanger?&quot; Zell smiled, punching his palm.

Quistis nodded and looked to Cid. &quot;We&#39;ve written everything down if you 
would like to look them over?&quot; She said smiling.

&quot;No, no. This is more of Squall&#39;s dealings now.&quot; Cid chuckled. &quot;I&#39;m sure 
you youngsters can handle it. I&#39;m just a wily old headmaster now.&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot; Quistis grinned as Edea, Seifer and Squall reentered the 
office.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Squall asked curiously.

&quot;No luck on the trace.&quot; Rinoa answered quietly.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?&quot; Squall said, looking perplexed.

&quot;Nothing.&quot; She started, then paused. &quot;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll tell you later. 
I&#39;m heading home.&quot; She mumbled, kissing him on the cheek. He blushed at 
the public display but nodded warmly.

&quot;I&#39;ll be home shortly after I finish up here.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; She smiled softly before departing.

&quot;I&#39;m heading to the hanger.&quot; Zell shouted as he charged out the door.

&quot;I shall take Seifer and see what I can do for him.&quot; Edea announced as 
everyone prepared to depart. Soon, only Quistis, Xu and Squall remained 
in the office with Cid. Quistis sat down heavily and sighed.

&quot;It&#39;s going to be fun juggling class along with this mess.&quot;

&quot;You knew the drawbacks when you took the job.&quot; Xu said without a hint 
of pity. Quistis eyed her shrewdly.

&quot;I&#39;m not complaining, I like a challenge, it keeps me busy. She smirked.

&quot;Xu, I&#39;ll need you to work with Zell and try to find out who did this.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do some searching around, try and dig up some info. I have some 
contacts in the area&#39;s near the island.&quot; Squall said.

&quot;Try to get some info from Dollet also. Something smells funny to me 
about all of that.&quot; Quistis said worriedly.

&quot;If you need my assistance, I&#39;m here. I&#39;m sure Laguna would help too.&quot; 
Cid said helpfully. Xu looked up thoughtfully.

&quot;The Ragnarok was built in Eshtar. We still know very little about the 
ship, there may be security measures we don&#39;t know about that can help 
identify our culprit.&quot;

&quot;Good idea.&quot; Squall admitted. &quot;Sir can you contact him?&quot; He asked Cid 
hopefully.

&quot;Of course, I&#39;ll call him as soon as possible.&quot; Cid nodded, jotting down 
a reminder on a notepad.

&quot;Quistis, I want you to bring me all the info on Luccian you have since 
you&#39;re suspicious of him. Also give me the lowdown on his father and 
that weapons company.&quot; Squall said eyeing her with a look concern.

&quot;What are you thinking?&quot; Quistis queried.

&quot;It&#39;s possible that they stole the ship for weapons research. I&#39;d 
imagine they would love to get their hands on some gear from Eshtar.&quot;

&quot;Too true.&quot; Quistis admitted.

&quot;Okay then, I guess that&#146;s it.&quot; Squall shrugged. &quot;I&#39;ll get back with you 
tomorrow at noon.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll get on it.&quot; Xu smirked with a look of determination.

&quot;Looks like we have our work cut out for us.&quot; Quistis laughed as they 
started to leave. Cid bid them all farewell and walked the out. He 
stopped Squall and clapped you young man on the back fatherly.

&quot;Glad to have you back safe and sound.&quot; He said warmly.

&quot;Glad to be back.&quot; Squall smirked before rushing to catch Quistis and Xu 
at the elevator.

*******************

Luccian stood quietly on the hilltop overlooking the main compound of 
Czar Industries. He wasn&#39;t quite sure how he got here, but he was 
thankful to be home, he had much to do. Looking down at his scorched and 
naked form he frowned in annoyance. This would not do, he wanted to look 
his best before meeting his father for the first time in years. His form 
shivered and wavered as if liquid while his flesh mended. Looking 
himself over he smiled in satisfaction as clothes formed around him 
leaving him clad in a sleek black suit. Feeling that he was ready, he 
started down the hill for home.</pre>
