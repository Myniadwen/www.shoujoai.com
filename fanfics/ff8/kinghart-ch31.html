<h1>King's Heart (part 31 of 31)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff8/index.html">Final Fantasy  8</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ffever.html">FFEverShadow</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff8/kinghart-ch30.html">Back to Part 30</a><p style="text-align:center;">To This Tragic End</p><p>Quistis felt a tug on her shirt and 
she looked down at the one 
responsible. It was Ama and she was holding a book.</p><p>"Yes?" Quistis asked.</p><p>"What 
this word mean?" Ama said.</p><p>"What <i>does</i> this word mean." Quistis corrected. Ama 
repeated after Quistis. The instructor was surprised by just how fast the young girl 
learned. She had read cases where children who didn't learn language at an early age would 
never be able to do so. Perhaps it was because Ama had been exposed, just not a lot. 
Quistis also made the hard decision of junctioning a GF to Ama. She picked Siren, deciding 
that she was the most literate of all the GFs. Certainly Ifrit would not have been an equal 
choice. Before giving her over to Ama, she told her to try to have conversations with Ama 
in her head, hoping it would speed up the process of having to learn the language by having 
Ama exposed to it at all times of the day. It was an odd request, normally GFs kept to 
themselves and didn't interfere with the thoughts of their host but Siren 
complied.</p><p>It seemed to have the effect that Quistis wanted. In a few weeks, despite 
Ama looking like she wanted to bang her head against the wall until Siren was forcibly 
removed from her, Ama was speaking in more complete sentences.</p><p>"Ok, say it after me, 
'alone.' It means you are by yourself and you don't have anyone to keep you company." 
Quistis said.</p><p>"Alone." Ama repeated. "Siren says that lots."</p><p>"Really? You're 
not alone anymore, Ama, you have Fujin and Raijin and all of us." Ama took a second to 
process the sentence before replying,</p><p>"No, about you." Quistis drew back. <i>"Goddamn 
it, Siren."</i> She thought angrily. "Siren says, you are alone. And...she says you are 
sad." Quistis patted Ama on the head.</p><p>"Don't worry about me, ok? I'm a big girl, I 
can take care of myself."</p><p>"Me too!" Ama replied, pulling out her chakram and 
grinning. Quistis ruffled her hair.</p><p>"Get back to that book, your exam is in a week." 
She ordered. "And then I'll take you out for a treat." Ama understood the word treat and 
scrambled off to study. Quistis let out a heavy sigh and rubbed her 
temples.</p><p>"Hyne...just when I thought I could get over it...how long has it been?" She 
whispered to herself.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Nira limped across the hallway, trying to 
reach her next class. The pain had mostly subsided but she still felt weak from all the 
drugs Dr. Kadowaki made her take. She had almost died that night and the event had left a 
permanent scar on her stomach. She blinked away angry tears when she remembered when she 
came to.</p><p><i>"She's waking up. Thank Hyne."</i> <i>It was Kadowaki's voice, no doubt. 
Her assistant stood nearby as they watched her open her eyes slowly. "How do you feel, 
Nira?"</i></p><p><i> "What happened?"</i></p><p><i> "You stabbed yourself with a gunblade, 
that's what happened." Kadowaki replied.</i></p><p><i> "Why didn't I die? Why didn't you 
let me die?" She whispered. </i></p><p><i> "Because I wasn't going to let you." Seifer said 
from the corner. Nira's eyes widened.</i></p><p><i> "Not him, why? Not him!" She gasped. 
Kadowaki watched her with concerned eyes.</i></p><p><i> "Calm down, Nira, please, you're 
still very, very weak." She shook her head as hard as she </i><i>could.</i></p><p><i> "Get 
him out of here! I never want to see him again!" She shouted as loud as she 
could.</i></p><p><i> "We'll need some sedative here." Kadowaki said calmly. Her assistant 
handed her a syringe and she stuck it in the IV. Soon Nira felt her body shutting down 
despite all the anger building up inside her. </i></p><p>Her friends treated her with some 
distance, afraid she might snap if they did anything wrong. But again the first thing she 
saw when she woke up was a flash of gray as Seifer scrambled out of sight. He hadn't left 
her side all night.</p><p>So it wasn't a surprise to see him again, peeking around the 
corner to make sure she was ok. He felt responsible for what she did. Nira dreamt of 
crushing him under her foot but his revelation made that impossible.</p><p>"Go away." She 
snapped and the blond tuft of hair vanished. She sighed and sat down in her classroom, 
knowing he was probably just out the door. The instructor prattled on about common 
espionage techniques that SeeD had to perform. She hardly paid any attention, thinking more 
about the pain and ways to destroy Seifer. However, the instructor said something that made 
her look up and listen.</p><p>"Sometimes, SeeD will go so far as to seduce their enemy. 
After all, the closer you can get to the enemy, the more secrets you're likely to get." 
Nira stared at the instructor, soaking in his words. Suddenly she knew exactly how to 
destroy Seifer.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Xu twisted and turned in her sleep. She couldn't 
close her eyes without picturing either Quistis or Becca's face and both of them hurt. She 
didn't know what to do. Quistis had always been there for her. She was the one Xu fell in 
love with most recently but Becca brought back a flood of memories and emotions she thought 
she had buried.</p><p>She stood up and decided to wander around, giving up on her nap. She 
knew it was unfair to lead them both on. Quistis was probably waiting for her back home, 
waiting until she came back and probably worrying everyday. But this was Becca and as much 
as Xu wanted to admit otherwise, she had always been in love with her.</p><p>"Damn it, why 
is this so hard?" Xu thought to herself, kicking a rock as hard as she could.</p><p>"You're 
going to hurt yourself." Xu jumped and readied herself for an attack. As soon as she 
recognized the voice, though, she relaxed.</p><p>"Don't do that." She sighed. Becca laughed 
a little and joined her on the rocky beach near the house.</p><p>"Xu...Xu I really want to 
talk to you about last night."</p><p>"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that. Well, I mean I 
did but not like that." Xu stammered. Becca smiled softly.</p><p>"It's not that, Xu. You 
have to understand that I'm in no position to...to do as my heart desires." Xu's head 
snapped towards Becca. In all the time that she knew her, she had never seen the older girl 
blush as she was doing.</p><p>"As what?" Xu asked</p><p>"I have a project to lead. I have a 
Third Weapon to find and destroy. I have Dr. Cradus's last wishes and wills and people who 
depend on the success of this mission. You're a SeeD, Xu. If it were up to you, would you 
risk everything for one person?" Becca replied. Xu bit her lip. She wasn't sure what she 
would do in that scenario.</p><p>"I don't know." She answered. "I mean...I'd like to think 
that I could do all of that."</p><p>"Xu, the Third Weapon is the most deadly of all the 
Weapons. Millions of people could die because I botched something."</p><p>"Why would you 
botch it?" Xu demanded. "Why would you botch it?"<br>"Because you throw me out of focus!" 
Becca yelled. Xu went silent with surprise. Becca inhaled deeply and went on. "Xu, I didn't 
know what to do when I saw you alive and well. On the one hand, I wanted to take you, to be 
with you. On the other hand I wanted to let you live your life without ever knowing that I 
was still alive. My brain lost that one, that's why you're here. But now that you're here 
every non-logical part of me wants you."</p><p>"I'm in love with you, Becca." Xu 
whispered.</p><p>"I know. And I love you too." Becca replied. "But I can't. I just...I 
can't." Xu didn't listen. She walked over to Becca and cupped her face and kissed her 
deeply. She felt Becca try to pull away at first but slowly she too melted into the kiss. 
When they pulled away, Becca looked at the ground.</p><p>"I can't, Xu." She hissed. Xu 
kissed her again and Becca kept repeating, "I can't." But soon, Becca found herself pulling 
the younger woman up the stairs, crashing into the walls. If everyone wasn't already in the 
lab, they surely would've poked a head out to see what was going on. Becca pulled Xu down 
onto her bed, still whispering "I can't" until she couldn't whisper anything 
anymore.</p><p>The sun was setting just as the two rested. Xu had her head on Becca's chest 
while Becca held her close.</p><p>"You still can't?" Xu teased. Becca smiled. It had been 
worth it. Bringing Xu to the island had been thoroughly worth it but she knew it had to end 
sometime.</p><p>"I won't regret it." Becca promised.</p><p>"I'll make sure you won't." The 
younger woman replied. Someone knocked softly on the door.</p><p>"Miss Becca? It's time." 
The voice said.</p><p>"Time? Time for what? Dinner?" Xu asked. Becca sighed and sat up, 
leaving Xu still lying on the bed.</p><p>"I have to go now." Becca said.</p><p>"Where are 
you going?" Xu demanded. "Why so suddenly?" Becca sighed and wouldn't meet Xu's eyes. The 
younger brunette suddenly remembered the conversation she had with Celia. "Becca, what are 
you hiding from me? I get the feeling there's something huge you're not telling me." Becca 
sat down next to her.</p><p>"I'm so sorry." She whispered, kissing Xu. Xu pulled away and 
was about to ask why when Becca hit her as hard as she could in the head. Blackness inked 
its way across Xu's vision and she fell sideways into oblivion.</p>
