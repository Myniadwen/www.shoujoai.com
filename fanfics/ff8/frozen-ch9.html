She walked calmly, as the storm attacked everything in its path with 
hellish wind and icy rain. It was a like a god whose fury ran unchecked 
in the darkness. Lightning split the sky, illuminating the dark waves 
that grew larger and far more threatening with every moment. Yet she 
walked unafraid.

The storm howled it&#146;s fury and attacked the aged and tortured bridge 
upon which she strode. It&#146;s steel bones whined in dismay at the assault. 
It had endured such assaults in the past and would be tortured still for 
years to come. The cold rain soaked her simple gown making it cling to 
every supple curve. Yet she did not care and still continued her silent 
trek.

*****************************

She was dying.

She knew she had little time.

&quot;Not like this&quot; She whispered weakly between feeble sobs. The storm 
heard not here pleas nor did it care as it slowly destroyed her. Water 
was pooling where she lay, near the steps and building. She felt a wave 
of shame as she realized she would probably drown in the puddle before 
succumbing to the elements. She tried to move sending white flashes of 
pain in her mind. Her shoulders shook as she tried to rise. The wind 
howled seeming contempt and hammered her back into submission. She 
collapsed face first with as gasp. She raised her head coughing up a 
foul mixture of mud and ocean water. She managed to curl up in a fetal 
position and rested her head on her arm. Her mind went to the friend she 
had left behind at the garden. She could feel the darkness creeping 
closer, calling her.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry Quistis.&quot; She whispered and closed her eyes.&quot;

&quot;What ever for my love?&quot; A soothing voice said softly, a warm a hand ran 
its fingers through her hair.

&quot;Poor thing, your so tired.&quot; Fujin opened her eye, her expression was 
one of resignation rather than surprise. She slowly stood and shook the 
hair from her face.

&quot;Its you.&quot; She said softly.

&quot;Who else would it be love.&quot; Quistis said with a sad smile.

&quot;Love. It sounds so simple when one admits it.&quot; Fujin said with a tragic 
grin.

&quot;We spend so much time worrying about trifling things, we don&#146;t see what 
we need to make us happy.&quot; Quistis said with a tinge of regret. She 
stepped forward took Fujin&#146;s hands in hers.

&quot;We barely knew each other.&quot; Fujin breathed, a tear rolling down her 
cheek. Quistis leaned and kissed it away. Fujin closed her eye and 
trembled.

&quot;I know, but it&#146;s one of those funny things. Sometimes it just happens, 
I think we both knew it that night on the balcony.&quot; Quistis said with a 
soothingly and gently reached with open arms. Fujin took a tentative 
step then collapsed into her embrace sobbing softly.

&quot;Don&#146;t cry beauty please don&#146;t cry.&quot;

&quot;Why&#146;d it have to be this way.&quot; Fujin murmured.
&quot;We were not ready to explore what we meant to each other.&quot; She placed a 
delicate hand under the girls chin lifting her gaze to meet hers. 
Fujin&#146;s heart raced, she had never felt this way, she was frightened. 
Quistis&#146;s expression soothed, her calmed her, brought her a warmth she 
never knew.

&quot;But here, now.&quot; Quistis whispered. &quot;We know how we feel.&quot; She leaned 
down slowly her diamond blue eyes glimmering. Fujin sighed closing her 
eye letting herself give in, her lips parted invitingly.

&quot;It&#146;s time love.&quot; Quistis said sadly.

Fujin opened her eye and was startled to see that Quistis was standing 
far away from her.

&quot;Why?&quot; She cried in dismay. Quistis looked at her with tears in her 
eyes.

&quot;You need to be going.&quot; She said softly.

&quot;I don&#146;t understand.&quot; Fujin whimpered and tried to walk to her, only 
trip. She collapsed to her knees. She reached out calling her name as 
Quistis turned and walked into the storm.

&quot;I don&#146;t want to lose you! Not now!&quot; Fujin begged, her heart shattering.

&quot;Then don&#146;t&quot; Quistis whispered in her mind over the growing wind. Fujin 
collapsed into tears her whole body shaking. It was getting darker and 
she felt the cold biting her. She raised her head to call out one last 
time hoping, begging.

&quot;I don&#146;t want to be alone anymore.&quot; She pleaded softly, then she saw it, 
what had stopped her, what she tripped over. She grew cold.

&quot;NO!&quot; She screamed in horror as she saw her own limp and broken form 
lying in the rain.

Fujin&#146;s eye tore open and she screamed a silent scream. The wind 
responded with it&#146;s own roar battering her. She hauled herself to her 
knees, pain coursed through her body threatening to end her life then 
and there. She growled and concentrated on the pain and fed on it. With 
a cry she clawed her way along the ground towards the wayfarer station. 
Her mind and body burned equally, she was feverish and could hardly 
think. She pulled herself up the steps and paused to rest. The rain 
pounded her mercilessly she could feel her scorched skin flaying under 
its attack. She glared at the welded door that led inside and tried to 
focus. Her whole body shook as she concentrated, trying to call the 
spell to mind. Magic was difficult to begin with but was all but 
impossible in her present condition. She began to weaken and tire, her 
brief burst of strength quickly fading.

&quot;DAMN!&quot; She screamed in fury. Almost as if on cue a large icy javelin 
materialized before her. Then just as quickly it streaked to the door 
slamming it open. Fujin collapsed in relief, but only briefly, before 
crawling for the doorway. She made it in and was in a near frenzied 
state. With a grunt she kicked the remains of the door shut with her 
good leg. Then pushed over a nearby coat rack to keep it shut. She 
barely acknowledged the quickly melting spear. Not what she intend but 
she was happy for anything.

She let herself rest a moment, the building sounded like it was going to 
be hammered apart

but she didn&#146;t worry about it. She was too tired, too hungry, and in too 
much pain to care about anything but sitting still a moment.

&quot;No.&quot; She told herself, realizing if she didn&#146;t take care of business 
she would probably die within the hour. She clawed to the nearest table 
and beat the hell out of it with her fist until it fell apart. Satisfied 
she took a few promising pieces and set them aside. She hated what she 
had to do next. She looked at her ankle and carefully pried her shoe and 
sock off. Her whole foot was a bloated nasty black and purple mass. With 
a purposeful grunt and no time to reconsider she grabbed her ankle in 
both hands and snapped it back into position. Her eye rolled in its 
socket as white hot motes of pain seared her sanity. She was beginning 
to think being dead was better. She thought of Quistis then shook her 
head, she would worry about that later. She removed her shirt and ripped 
it to shreds leaving her in her sports bra. Working quickly she used 
it&#146;s remains to make a brace from the wood fragments. Her chore complete 
she breathed a sigh of relief. She felt better but unconsciousness was 
singing its siren song to her she had to hurry. Now that she was indoors 
and could think clearly she closed her eye and brought her last healing 
spell to mind. She felt the soothing warmth grow over her, seeking her 
wounds and mending them as best it could. It was not enough to heal her 
ankle fully but her skin cleared and the overwhelming pain gave way to a 
dull ache. down. The feeling was near orgasmic, her head rolled back and 
she collapsed once again into unconsciousness.

*************************

Quistis awoke with a moan. Sitting up she rubbed her temples groggily.

&quot;Just a dream.&quot; She murmured in dismay. Looking around she had no idea 
where she was. She trailed her fingers over the satin sheets that where 
draped about her. She noticed the pictures on the small night-stand 
beside the bed and remembered. She recalled coming here but she did not 
know how. She fell back on the bed and looked up she was worried now. 
The dream scared her, she did not even consider the possibility that 
Fujin could be dead. She held deep feelings for her. She was adult 
enough to admit that much to herself, but not to anyone else. How far 
she was willing to explore those feelings however she was not sure.

&quot;Too late now though. Not that it matters.&quot; She frowned at the thought. 
She knew if she let herself believe that she had and chance at happiness 
she would not do what needed to be done.

&quot;Who knows perhaps I can see her then.&quot; She thought.

&quot;Just a dream.&quot; She whispered again with a sad sigh. She could feel the 
beast creeping back upon her. She brought her hands to her face trying 
not to let it back into her mind.

***************************

It had been a half and hour since class started. The students where 
oddly quiet, no one really said anything but they where all a bit 
worried. Rinoa more than anyone. She never knew Quistis to be late or 
even call in sick. No one had seen her since yesterday and she was 
getting a horrible feeling something was very wrong. She had tried to 
get her to open up to her, talk to her, something, but to no avail. She 
knew Quistis was a bit resentful towards her relationship with Squall. 
She had tried to be friends with her and to a degree they where, they 
couldn&#146;t help but be after all they went through together.

Rinoa knew she had no real way to help Quistis through her problems. But 
she wanted to be there for her as best she could. It angered her to feel 
so helpless while someone she held dear disintegrated. She slammed her 
hand on her desk and stood, drawing startled looks from her fellow 
students. Royce looked at her suspiciously.

&quot;What are you up?&quot; He said with his rich island accent. Rinoa looked 
absently then looked into his dusky brown eyes.

&quot;Nothing hon, I am going to see if Xu knows where Quistis is.&quot; She 
smiled warily and walked to the classroom door. The door opened right as 
she reached it, she stopped and took a step back as Edea entered the 
room. The class broke out into hushed whispers. Even Luccian looked 
impressed.

&quot;EDEA!?&quot; Rinoa gasped, the she flushed at her out burst. Edea smiled her 
ever haunting smile.

&quot;Calm thyself child least you age before you years.&quot; She said calmly as 
she walked past her and to Qusitis&#146;s desk. Rinoa meekly sat back down 
feeling like a buffoon. Edea wore a simple black dress shirt and skirt, 
her raven black hair was held back behind her by a single jade hair 
clip. Quite a different and dramatic look for her Rinoa thought. Luccian 
whistled low and elbowed Archibald earning a all to dangerous look from 
the matron of the garden.

&quot;Miss Trepe is feeling under the weather, so I will be teaching your 
course today.&quot; She said evenly

More hushed whispers amid the students and the Treppies seemed about to 
burst with worry. Aeka stood up abruptly.

&quot;Is she okay?! I mean she&#146;s not going to die or anything is she! That 
would be just horrible, I mean I don&#146;t know what I would do. She&#146;s like 
a roll model to me, she&#146;s like the mother I never had! Can we see her? I 
need to get her a present! Oh my what if she is already dead and they 
are just waiting the right time to tell us!&quot; She exploded into tears. 
Rinoa slumped in her chair embarrassed at the girls outburst. Edea 
walked over to the small young woman. She touched the girls shoulder 
comfortingly.

&quot;Worry not child.&quot; Her eyes drifted to fix on Rinoa&#146;s as she still 
regarded the sobbing girl. &quot;She is in capable hands.&quot; Rinoa stared back, 
she knew Edea was talking to her more than anyone else.

&quot;Ah who cares where she is.&quot; Luccian droned in annoyance, he was fed up 
with this idol worship nonsense. Everyone looked at him some in shock, 
some downright insulted.

&quot;I&#146;m serious people! For Hyne&#146;s sake look at yourselves.&quot;

Archibald scooted away from him not wanting any of the inevitable heat 
from his outburst.

Edea arched a brow and regarded him. Rinoa glared at him and stood. He 
did likewise though he had no intention of tangling with Rinoa. He did 
not fear her, but Squall was another story. He had no illusions of his 
chances against him. That didn&#146;t keep him from speaking his mind.

&quot;I&#146;ll I hear theses days is Trepe this Trepe that. You people act like 
she a deity or something. It&#146;s ridiculous, sad really. You would think 
we where all children here.&quot;

Royce stood up calmly.

&quot;That&#146;s about enough out of you Luccian. You are doing your position a 
great indignity.&quot;

&quot;Me??&quot; Luccian gawked then laughed. &quot;Your one to talk you jackass your 
worse than any of them. Fawning on her like a lovesick idiot.&quot; Aeka 
burst into tears again and Royce blanched speechless.

&quot;Yeah truth hurts doesn&#146;t it.&quot; Luccian spat with a wicked grin.

&quot;Your horrible!&quot; Rinoa shouted and moved towards him, her fists 
clenched.

&quot;Oh and what&#146;s your deal girl? Who do you think your fooling coming into 
this class like your one of us.&quot; Luccian folded his arms looking down at 
her as she stalked towards him.

&quot;Shut up!&quot; She screamed.

&quot;Why? You going to sic your boyfriend on me?&quot; He laughed again, his 
anger emboldened him

&quot;Shut up!&quot; She could feel herself losing it.

&quot;Yeah, yeah here you come down here with us rabble trying to be one of 
us. Tell me girl do you know what suffering is. I know your story girl 
we all do.&quot; He gestured to the class who stood in shocked silence.

&quot;Poor little rich girl thinks she knows the real world. Get outta my 
face. You think your some sort of hero. We all know you rode Squall&#146;s 
coattails. Hell at least Quistis is one of us I may not like her but I 
respect the woman. You, your shit, get the hell out of here.&quot; He looked 
at her disgusted and turned to storm out. Royce leapt at him, his 
normally peaceful exterior shattered.

&quot;You son of a!&quot;

Edea had seen enough.

&quot;Silence.&quot; She said simply, everyone was blown off their feet by a 
intense force.

&quot;This foolishness is at a end children.&quot; She said softly, her face calm.

&quot;You are all supposed to be better than this. To fight amongst 
yourselves is foolish and pointless. I am disappointed in you all.&quot;

&quot;Luccian, you are from this point on removed from the Disciplinary 
Committee.&quot;

&quot;What!? You can&#146;t do that you witch! Your not even in charge.&quot; He roared 
in outrage and jumped up. Everyone scattered to the far corners of the 
room. Rinoa stood and looked on in surprise at his impulsiveness.

&quot;Do not presume to tell me anything boy.&quot; She said with only a faint 
hint of anger.

&quot;I presume to say my mind and you can&#146;t stop me.&quot; He moved towards her. 
Archibald looked at him horrified.

&quot;What the hell are you doing man!?&quot; He hissed under his breath.

Luccian stood face to face with Edea and glared at her. Rinoa felt she 
would strike him dead at any moment. Edea instead only regarded him 
almost sadly.

&quot;Such potential, to be clouded by such anger and self loathing, it&#146;s a 
pity.&quot; She whisperd.

Luccian&#146;s eyes thinned dangerously.

&quot;Your disillusioned Matron. I plan to live up to my potential and I will 
remember.&quot; He stormed out of the room slamming the door behind him.

Edea turned and walked back to Quistis&#146;s desk. Everyone stood stupefied 
and shaken.

&quot;Back to your seats children and we shall begin.&quot; She said evenly.</pre>
