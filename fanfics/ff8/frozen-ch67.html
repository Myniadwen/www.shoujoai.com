&quot;You look amazing.&quot; Quistis smiled, causing Fujin to blush slightly.

&quot;TROUBLE.&quot; She commented, trying to put Quistis&#146; attention elsewhere.

&quot;I told you, I&#146;m not worried about them.&quot; Quistis grinned, not taking 
her eyes of her as she reached out to caress her cheek. Sighing, Fujin 
closed her pressed against her palm warmly.

&quot;You never cease to amaze me.&quot; Quistis whispered, interlocked her hands 
with hers. &quot;Poor thing, you look terrified, I can only imagine how hard 
it was for you to come. I&#146;m glad you did though.&quot;

&quot;NOT HARD.&quot; Fujin shrugged.

&quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;COME TO WATCH KEVIN.&quot; She admitted, cutting a glance in his direction.

&quot;That&#146;s adorable.&quot; Quistis giggled. &quot;All this because you&#146;re jealous?&quot;

Fujin huffed slightly, then frowned.

&quot;NOT TRUE.&quot; She said quietly. &quot;WANTED...&quot; She took a breath and met 
Quistis&#146; gaze softly. &quot;TO BE WITH YOU.&quot;

Saying nothing, Quistis brought Fujin&#146;s hands to her lips and kissed her 
knuckles softly.

&quot;Thank you.&quot; She said softly.

A long silence past as they gazed quietly at each other. Finally, Fujin 
wiggled uncomfortably in her seat.

&quot;BUTT COLD.&quot; She grinned.

Arching a brow, Quistis smiled suggestively at the comment, causing 
Fujin to giggle and blush once more.

&quot;You&#146;re so cute. That&#146;s what I like to hear.&quot; Quistis cooed, caressing 
her hand.

&quot;NOT CUTE.&quot; Fujin said with indignation.

&quot;Delicious then.&quot; Quistis amended with a wicked smile.

Fujin looked away blushing even more profusely. Quistis didn&#146;t buy it, 
knowing full well that she loved the attention.

&quot;What the?&quot; Rinoa squinted, trying to get a better view.

&quot;Quit being noisy.&quot; Xu snapped angrily.

&quot;Why? What&#146;s going on?&quot; Nicole grinned, turning around curiously, 
sensing something amiss.

&quot;Just wait.&quot; Xu said, not smiling in the least.

&quot;You don&#146;t think...?&quot; Irvine said abruptly, his eyes widening as he 
turned in his seat to look over at Quistis and Fujin.

&quot;What dude?&quot; Zell laughed warily, looking at him with curious interest.

&quot;Guess.&quot; Irvine smirked hugely, nodding for Zell to take a better look.

Having to turn around fully in his seat to see, he ignored all protests 
from Nicole to be discrete. After a moment, his jaw went slack, as he 
noticed the intimate way the two women were holding hands as they 
talked.

&quot;NO WAY!&quot; He blurted loudly in disbelief before being swatted into 
submission by nearly everyone at the table.

Quistis and Fujin both heard the outburst and sighed in unison. Turning 
around, the two noticed their little group of friends trying their 
damnedest to appear innocent of any wrongdoing.

&quot;RIDICULOUS.&quot; Fujin frowned.

&quot;And, it&#146;s only going to get worse.&quot; Quistis smiled softly the shrugged. 
&quot;But, I&#146;m tired of trying to hide how I feel.&quot;

&quot;BAD JOB ANYWAY.&quot; Fujin huffed sarcastically.

Quistis pursed her lips scornfully.

&quot;Like you&#146;re one to talk.&quot; She said rising to her feet as another slow 
song began to play. &quot;Come on.&quot;

&quot;WHERE?&quot; Fujin asked worriedly.

&quot;Dance with me?&quot; Quistis asked with a wink.

Fujin balked and shook her head awkwardly.

&quot;What, why not?&quot; Quistis pouted, slightly hurt. &quot;And here I thought you 
didn&#146;t care what people thought.&quot; She smirked.

&quot;UNABLE.&quot; Fujin mumbled, rubbing her eye with her palm.

&quot;Oh you have to learn sometime. Besides, you&#146;re graceful; I&#146;ll lead you 
through it. Trust me.&quot; Quistis smiled invitingly.

Nodding quietly Fujin stood and followed; their hands still locked 
snuggly together. They&#146;d begun to draw more than a few stares by the 
time they arrived on the dance floor but thankfully, both were too 
enraptured to care.

&quot;Squall, are you seeing this!&quot; Zell squeaked, elbowing the half-drunk 
leader. Squall glanced up and rolled his eyes before going back to 
nursing his drink.

&quot;I can&#146;t believe it!&quot; Zell babbled over and over, but no one was 
listening.

Irvine grinned lewdly and arched a brow at everyone at the table.

&quot;This night just got a helluva lot more interesting.&quot; He said darkly.

&quot;Oh grow up.&quot; Selphie barked irritably, still watching the goings on 
with increasing interest.

Celest was bewildered. But Fujin&#146;s request for assistance made far more 
sense now. She wasn&#146;t sure how she felt about all of this and frowned 
slightly. Finally, she shrugged it away and turned her attention to 
Kevin who appeared lost in thought.

&quot;I refuse to believe this is what it appears.&quot; Rinoa finally commented 
flatly with a grim look on her face.

&quot;Oh I get it now.&quot; Nida said cheerfully as if a light bulb clicked on 
somewhere. &quot;That was a double date wasn&#146;t it.&quot; He said, grinning at Xu. 
&quot;What a minute...&quot; He added, his eyes widening as the full implications 
hit him.

Xu rolled her eyes and buried her head in her hands.

&quot;What?&quot; Rinoa and Selphie said in unison, looking at them.

&quot;Xu and I went on a double date with them a while back.&quot; He shrugged.

&quot;You knew about this?&quot; Selphie asked Xu warily.

&quot;Knew about what!?&quot; Xu said defensively, not wishing to complicate 
things.

&quot;You did!&quot; Selphie blinked in shock.

&quot;I don&#146;t believe it, I refuse to believe it.&quot; Rinoa huffed. 
&quot;Quistis...that&#146;s just... just.... Squall if it&#146;s true...surely you have 
to...to...?&quot; She babbled in heavy mix of exasperation and confusion.

&quot;Leave me out of this!&quot; He blurted in near terror, causing Zell to 
flinch at the outburst.

&quot;Dude calm down.&quot; He laughed then went back to watching the two women 
dance.

&quot;I dunno, its weird but I think they kinda make a cute couple.&quot; Nicole 
said after a moment&#146;s deliberation. &quot;Not that I&#146;d know about that sort 
of thing.&quot; She added awkwardly.

&quot;Oh I think they do.&quot; Irvine all but purred, and ducked the incoming 
swing from Selphie. She looked at him in disgust then turned around 
having seen enough. &quot;This is going to be such a big stink.&quot; She giggled. 
&quot;I just hope it doesn&#146;t cause any major problems.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;ll be fine.&quot; Xu frowned.

&quot;Are you blind!? How can you say that!?&quot; Rinoa all but yelled, causing 
Squall to wince.

&quot;Rinoa, keep it down, sheesh.&quot; Zell whispered loudly.

&quot;Oh they&#146;re drawing some heavy duty looks.&quot; Nicole pointed out 
worriedly.

&quot;Don&#146;t yell at me Rinoa.&quot; Xu said dangerously, sipping her drink.

&quot;Everyone calm down. Xu&#146;s right, it&#146;s not a problem or even our 
concern.&quot; Irvine said, finally turning back around to face them. Selphie 
looked at him, pleasantly surprised.

&quot;Lets not ruin the night by throwing a hissy fit.&quot; He added.

&quot;A fit...&quot; Rinoa frowned and looked at Celest. &quot;What do you think? 
You&#146;re brother seems to think this is nothing.&quot;

&quot;Why are you asking me?&quot; Celest blinked, looking up in surprise.

&quot;Well?&quot; Rinoa prodded.

&quot;So what, yeah it&#146;s strange but its nothing to do with me.&quot; Celest 
shrugged.

&quot;But she kept it a secret, we&#146;re her friends, we could have done 
something.&quot; Rinoa said, getting exasperated.

&quot;Done what?&quot; Nicole scowled in disappointment. &quot;Rinoa that&#146;s not like 
you, its not like she&#146;s been possessed or something.&quot;

&quot;Here&#146;s an idea, they could be playing a prank.&quot; Zell said thoughtfully. 
Everyone looked at him as if he were a fool. &quot;Or not.&quot; He added quietly, 
sinking into his seat.

&quot;You&#146;re all acting like ninnies, we&#146;re all adults here so lets act like 
it. She&#146;s our friend, the least we can do is support her for Hyne&#146;s 
sake.&quot; Selphie groaned, getting bored with the arguing.

&quot;I agree.&quot; Zell said firmly.

Squall glanced sideways at Rinoa as she fell back into her seat in a 
huff. Shaking his head, he rubbed his brow.

Fujin rested her head comfortably on Quistis&#146; shoulder as they danced, 
the music serenading them dreamily as they lost track of time and 
worries. At first, other couples moved awkwardly unsure how to react but 
soon, most focused on their partners, as did the majority of those 
present at the dance. The whispers and odd stares continued however as 
was to be expected. Cid watched thoughtfully from nearby the entrance.

&quot;What do you know, you were right.&quot; He thought with a chuckle.

&quot;What&#146;s so funny?&quot; An older man frowned; he was a teacher and one of 
Quistis&#146; peers.

&quot;Nothing, just thinking about Edea.&quot; Cid grinned.

&quot;If I may be so bold Cid, this is problematic to say the least. Trepe 
should know better than to do this sort of thing.&quot; The man said 
disapprovingly.

&quot;I didn&#146;t know we were on such formal terms Henry.&quot; Cid said in slightly 
miffed tone.

&quot;Sorry Sir.&quot; The man mumbled.

&quot;Rest assured, Miss Trepe can handle her own affairs, they&#146;re not your 
concern, understand.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir.&quot;

&quot;Wonderful, wonderful. Well then, enjoy the party, now, if you&#146;ll excuse 
me.&quot; Cid smiled before moving away, leaving the man stewing in his own 
juices.

Finally, the song ended although Quistis and Fujin remained together for 
a moment longer before separating, both gazing lovingly at each other.

&quot;Shall we go sit back down?&quot; Quistis grinned.

&quot;SCANDALOUS.&quot; Fujin smirked, glancing around.

&quot;Of course.&quot;

Fujin shook her head and motioned for her to lead on. Hand in hand the 
two walked quietly back the waiting group and sat down. The silence was 
deafening and Quistis looked around somewhat expectantly. Rinoa looked 
about ready to burst but to her credit, she reigned it in. Taking a 
breath and a sip of her wine Quistis finally spoke.

&quot;Well, in case you haven&#146;t figured it out, I&#146;ll just come out and say 
it.&quot; She said quietly. &quot;Fujin and I are a couple.&quot;

&quot;We know, I just wasn&#146;t expecting you to tell us so soon.&quot; Squall 
hiccuped. &quot;Pass the breadsticks please.&quot; He added, gesturing to the bowl 
in front of her. Rinoa spun on him and gawked.

&quot;BREADSTICKS!? You knew about this!?&quot; She blurted loudly.

&quot;It was obvious.&quot; Squall shrugged then reached for the bowl since no one 
else was forthcoming.

&quot;How long!?&quot; Rinoa scowled in disbelief.

&quot;A few weeks at least, I&#146;m not sure, it&#146;s been awhile.&quot; He sighed; just 
wishing everyone would drop it.

&quot;I don&#146;t believe this.&quot; Rinoa gasped, shaking her head.

&quot;Um...okay.&quot; Quistis blushed, feeling silly.

&quot;About time, I was tired of pretending not to know, now we can get to 
the good stuff.&quot; Selphie giggled excitedly.

Now all eyes turned to her and she stuck her tongue out at them.

&quot;KNEW IT.&quot; Fujin snapped at her accusingly.

&quot;Hey, don&#146;t get mad at me.&quot; Selphie huffed. &quot;Like I said, you&#146;ve a big 
mouth.&quot; She grinned, winking at Irvine who glared at her in 
disappointment.

&quot;You heard us that night at Nicole&#146;s&quot; Quistis said knowingly.

&quot;What about me?&quot; Nicole balked. &quot;What were you two doing!?&quot;

&quot;Oh man...&quot; Zell blushed.

&quot;TALKING.&quot; Fujin blurted before imaginations ran wild.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Nicole breathed in relief.

&quot;What a night...&quot; Zell grinned. &quot;This is too cool.&quot;

Quistis and Fujin looked at him in surprise.

&quot;What? I mean you two are like made for each other. I can&#146;t believe it 
didn&#146;t occur to me before.&quot;

&quot;Zell!?&quot; Rinoa gawked, in shock at him.

&quot;Problem?&quot; Quistis frowned.

&quot;Aw don&#146;t worry about her Miss Trepe, she&#146;s just a little worked up.&quot; 
Zell apologized.

&quot;Rinoa?&quot; Quistis asked, looking at her worriedly.

&quot;Lets dance.&quot; Xu said quietly to Nida, not wanting to be ensnared in the 
upcoming brouhaha. Rinoa set her jaw and frowned as she tried to find 
the proper words. Squall interrupted her and stood.

&quot;I&#146;m turning in for the night.&quot; He announced, tottering slightly.

&quot;You okay dude?&quot; Zell asked, noting his imbalance.

&quot;Looks like the boss man drank to much.&quot; Irvine noted with a grin.

&quot;Hold on I&#146;ll come too.&quot; Rinoa said, starting to rise.

&quot;No, it looks like you gals have a lot to talk about. Better to get it 
over with now.&quot; Squall said gruffly, looking at the group. &quot;Zell, 
Irvine, walk me, I want to go over tomorrows work schedule.&quot; He added, 
looking sternly at the two men.

&quot;Hey, can&#146;t it wait, this is getting interesting.&quot; Irvine grumbled.

&quot;Go on you lug, we&#146;ll still be here when you get back.&quot; Selphie giggled, 
shoving him slightly.

&quot;You guys behave.&quot; Zell grinned, giving Nicole a quick kiss before 
hopping up. Rinoa looked up at Squall with worry.

&quot;You sure you don&#146;t want me to come with you?&quot; She frowned.

&quot;No, stay here, all of you obviously have something to sort out.&quot; He 
said then hiccuped.

&quot;See you tonight then.&quot; She sighed, giving him a hug before he left.

Celest was watching the proceedings with interest then turned to look at 
Kevin only to find that he&#146;d all but vanished.

&quot;What the?&quot; She frowned, looking about. &quot;Where&#146;d he go?&quot;

&quot;He took off with Watts and Zone just a minute ago.&quot; Irvine noted as the 
three headed out.

&quot;Damn it. He didn&#146;t even say bye.&quot; She sighed.

&quot;Yikes.&quot; Selphie mumbled.

&quot;That&#146;s harsh.&quot; Nicole added.

&quot;Sorry Celest.&quot; Quistis apologized.

&quot;Ah who needs him, he&#146;s a jerk.&quot; Celest groaned, ruffling her hair as if 
to wake herself. &quot;Besides, we&#146;ve more important things to discuss.&quot; She 
then giggled. Quistis sighed heavily and shook her head, this was going 
to be a mess and she knew it.

&quot;Celest&#146;s right Trepe!&quot; Selphie said, leaning forward as if in a secret 
huddle.

&quot;Time to spill the beans.&quot;

&quot;Oh Hyne...&quot;

&quot;I think we know all we need too.&quot; Nicole commented quietly.

&quot;I beg to differ.&quot; Rinoa frowned, folding her arms expectantly.

Fujin looked up and sighed, comforted only by the knowledge none of them 
would risk asking her anything.

&quot;Just how long has this been going on.&quot; Rinoa asked.

&quot;What is this an inquisition!?&quot; Quistis gawked.

&quot;Something like that.&quot; Selphie giggled.

&quot;This isn&#146;t funny Selphie, its serious.&quot; Rinoa scowled

&quot;Serious smerious, I just want the juicy details.&quot; Selphie responded 
cattily.

&quot;Oh for the love of...&quot; Nicole giggled, blushing.

&quot;What!? Why is everyone being so timid, we&#146;re adults here? I mean hell, 
I even experimented once in Trabia, it was fun, I had this roommate and 
she...&quot;

&quot;Selphie!&quot; Rinoa shouted in shock, causing everyone in the dance hall to 
look at her. Celest exploded into laughter and Quistis winced.

&quot;Oh gods.&quot; Nicole groaned, blushing brightly she buried her head in her 
hands.

&quot;What!?&quot; Selphie blinked, confused by Rinoa&#146;s reactions. &quot;Oh since when 
did you become a close minded hard ass.&quot; She barked, causing Celest to 
erupt further.

&quot;Selphie...Celest, please.&quot; Quistis blushed, trying to settle them down.

&quot;What&#146;s gotten into you, I can&#146;t believe what I&#146;m hearing.&quot; Rinoa 
gawked.

&quot;Rinoa.&quot; Quistis said calmly, trying to reign them both in.

&quot;And you! You come in here and drop a bomb like this and expect us to 
just roll over and be okay with it.&quot; Rinoa blurted, growing frustrated.

&quot;Sugar you&#146;re gonna blow a fuse, calm down.&quot; Celest sighed, then took a 
healthy gulp from her drink.

&quot;What happens now Quistis!? I mean how can things be the same, I can&#146;t 
believe you hid something like this.&quot; Rinoa continued, albeit in a harsh 
whisper.

&quot;QUISTIS NOT ANSWER TO YOU.&quot; Fujin said icily.

&quot;Fujin.&quot; Quistis sighed, placing a calming hand on her thigh.

Rinoa had a few comments prepared for Fujin but the memory of their last 
hostile encounter dissuaded her from expressing them.

&quot;Okay you guys, can we please talk like civilized people, or at least 
pretend to be.&quot; Nicole sighed.

&quot;Rinoa, it&#146;s this simple.&quot; Quistis said quietly, her voice oddly cold 
and emotionless. &quot;If you can&#146;t deal with this we&#146;ll just have to quit 
associating with each other alone.&quot;

Rinoa looked hurt by the comment and frowned sadly.

&quot;Quisty, I&#146;m not going to lie, it troubles me to death that you 
two...well you know.... But... That&#146;s not why I&#146;m mad.&quot;

&quot;Then what&#146;s the problem.&quot; Quistis asked.

&quot;The fact that you kept it a secret... It&#146;s like you couldn&#146;t trust us 
or something.&quot;

&quot;Really, Trepe, I mean, you tell Xu but keep us in the dark. I had to 
find out by eavesdropping for crying out loud.&quot; Selphie pouted.

&quot;And you!&quot; Rinoa glared hotly at her.

&quot;What?&quot; Selphie jumped, surprised by her outburst.

&quot;You found out god knows when and didn&#146;t tell no one either.&quot; Rinoa 
huffed in aggravation.

&quot;Don&#146;t yell at me, hell, you&#146;re boyfriend knew before any of us.&quot; 
Selphie shot back.

&quot;She kinda has a point.&quot; Nicole added quietly.

&quot;Look ladies, its all the past, we know now. If Quistis wanted to keep 
it a secret then that&#146;s her prerogative.

&quot;Listen you guys, its just that.&quot; Quistis sighed, feeling awkward. &quot;With 
Fujin being my um...student at the time we felt it may be better to wait 
until after graduation.&quot; She explained, blushing slightly.

&quot;What?&quot; Rinoa frowned, not even comprehending.

&quot;That&#146;s the big deal?&quot; Selphie laughed.

&quot;Um Quistis I hate to point it out to you but I&#146;m dating the head honcho 
of SEED and I&#146;m a student.&quot; Rinoa blurted in exasperation then grinned 
slightly.

&quot;Um...well its not the same, you were dating him...before...&quot; Quistis 
tried to explain while feeling more and more foolish. Fujin made a 
noise, then coughed down a giggle.

&quot;What are you laughing at.&quot; Quistis asked cattily.

&quot;NOTHING.&quot; Fujin answered, with a slight grin.

&quot;Don&#146;t laugh, it was you&#146;re idea.&quot; Quistis chided.

&quot;I can&#146;t believe we&#146;re having this conversation.&quot; Nicole smiled.

&quot;Smooth Trepe, really smooth.&quot; Selphie groused, shaking her head.

&quot;Look I&#146;m sorry.&quot; Quistis offered. &quot;It seemed like the right thing to 
do. Besides, our relationship isn&#146;t like yours.&quot;

&quot;You can say that again.&quot; Rinoa grumbled under her breath.

&quot;Rinoa...&quot; Nicole warned under her breath.

&quot;So, then, what happens now.&quot; Quistis asked the group. &quot;Is everyone okay 
now or what...?&quot;

Selphie looked at the two and considered making a sarcastic remark but 
realized that Fujin would probably take it the wrong way.

&quot;Sure...&quot; She said with a silly grin.

&quot;I guess I&#146;m okay with it. I just want us all to get along.&quot; Nicole 
shrugged, smiling quietly.

&quot;Heck perhaps I need to give it a try, Hyne knows I&#146;m having no luck 
with men.&quot; Celest groaned, sitting back in her chair with a huff.

&quot;You&#146;re not going to be checking me out and stuff now are you...&quot; Rinoa 
asked awkwardly.

&quot;Of Hyne Rinoa...of course not.&quot; Quistis frowned as if the concept was 
distasteful. &quot;Besides you&#146;re more Fujin&#146;s type.&quot; She added absently.

Fujin and Rinoa&#146;s eyes both went wide with shock.

&quot;LIAR.&quot; Fujin blurted in disgust. &quot;LOOK AT HER.&quot;

&quot;Yeah!&quot; Rinoa agreed then paused. &quot;What is that supposed to mean, what&#146;s 
wrong with me!?&quot; She frowned, insulted by the comment. Selphie burst 
into laughter dragging Nicole and Celest with her.

&quot;That&#146;s not funny damn it.&quot; Rinoa huffed, as Quistis joined the 
merriment. &quot;I can&#146;t believe you... you&#146;re all a bunch of children!&quot; 
Rinoa pouted, blushing slightly.

&quot;AGREED.&quot; Fujin mumbled sourly.

&quot;That&#146;s what I like to hear.&quot; Cid said cheerfully, curious as to what 
was so funny.

&quot;Hello Sir.&quot; Selphie giggled.

&quot;Sir.&quot; Nicole nodded, snickering lightly.

&quot;They&#146;re picking on me.&quot; Rinoa sulked.

&quot;Only because you deserve it.&quot; Celest laughed.

&quot;Ladies...please a modicum of dignity.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;Don&#146;t stop on my account.&quot; Cid said graciously. &quot;I just came to see how 
you all were doing.&quot;

&quot;Not that good Sir, it&#146;s been a very strange night.&quot; Rinoa whined.

&quot;I imagine so.&quot; Cid chuckled, putting a hand on Quistis&#146; shoulder. &quot;You 
my dear, have started a scandal.&quot; He said sagely.

Quistis sunk weakly in her seat.

&quot;Sorry sir.&quot;

&quot;See!&quot; Rinoa yelped, feeling vindicated.

&quot;Rinoa, please.&quot; Cid hushed her.

&quot;Sorry...&quot; She frowned sheepishly.

&quot;Now, Quistis, this isn&#146;t going to cause any problems with your work is 
it?&quot; He asked mildly.

&quot;No sir, not at all.&quot; Quistis said quickly, looking up at him.

&quot;Very well then, carry on.&quot; He said nodded then turned to leave. 
Everyone sat in silence a moment until finally Selphie giggled.

&quot;That was strange.&quot; She said grinning hugely.

Fujin arched a brow then turned to glance at him.

&quot;ODD.&quot; She mumbled, then turned back around.

&quot;Yeah, okay whatever...&quot; Celest chuckled.

&quot;Alright. Quistis, time to spill it.&quot; Selphie said firmly.

&quot;What now...?&quot; Quistis groaned, wearily.

&quot;Well, how did you two hook up? I mean, I&#146;m fairly sure it just happen 
out of the blue.&quot;

Quistis blushed and shook her head. Fujin turned towards her, a curious 
and expectant look on her face.

&quot;It&#146;s a long story....&quot; Quistis finally said in a quiet tone.

&quot;I bet.&quot; Celest noted.

&quot;She doesn&#146;t have to tell us if she doesn&#146;t want to.&quot; Nicole commented, 
feeling awkward about the conversation.

&quot;Really...I think we know enough without the details now.&quot; Rinoa sighed, 
taking a big draw from her drink.

&quot;Oh you guys are no fun at all.&quot; Selphie huffed.

&quot;We&#146;re back!&quot; Zell announced, jogging over quickly and all but falling 
into his seat.

&quot;What did we miss! Anyone kiss yet!&quot; Irvine grinned wolfishly, sitting 
down.

&quot;GROW UP.&quot; Fujin scowled.

&quot;Rowr!&quot; Irvine grinned, snapping his teeth at her; Selphie retaliated by 
assaulting him with annoyed but harmless shoves and slaps.

Quistis rubbed her temples, but was somewhat thankful, things could have 
been worse.

&quot;Well, I guess we&#146;ll get by. I&#146;m still hurt though, you should&#146;ve said 
something.&quot; Rinoa smiled begrudgingly.

&quot;You look great by the way Fujin.&quot; Nicole smiled politely.

&quot;Really!&quot; Zell said smilingly, giving her the thumbs up.

Irvine was about to comment but Selphie was already glaring at him 
hotly.

&quot;Is she blushing!?&quot; Celest grinned, looking on as Fujin shifted 
awkwardly under their gaze.

&quot;I think so.&quot; Quistis smiled, looking at her.

&quot;SILENCE.&quot; Fujin snapped sourly, looking away.

&quot;That&#146;s something you don&#146;t see everyday.&quot; Zell smirked.

&quot;Hold on a second.&quot; Nicole giggled excitedly then fished about in her 
purse.

&quot;What?&quot; Celest asked, glancing curiously at the bag as Nicole pulled out 
a camera.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin announced immediately.

&quot;Aw calm down, lets get a group photo!&quot; Nicole giggled brightly.

&quot;That&#146;s cool.&quot; Zell grinned, jumping up and adjusting his tuxedo.

&quot;Sure why not...&quot; Rinoa sighed.

&quot;To bad Squall&#146;s not here.&quot; Selphie said, as everyone gathered.

&quot;He would&#146;ve sneaked off.&quot;

&quot;Hey Sir!&quot; Nicole shouted, waving at Cid.

Looking curious, he walked over to the gathering with a smile.

&quot;Yes, yes, calm down.&quot; He chuckled as Nicole bounced cheerfully.

&quot;Will you take our picture!&quot; She pleaded merrily.

&quot;I&#146;d be happy to.&quot; He nodded, taking the camera from her.

&quot;Thank you sir!&quot; She said, then scurried to join everyone.

&quot;Everyone ready?&quot; Cid asked raising the camera. &quot;Okay then, smile.&quot; He 
grinned snapping the photo. Quistis&#146; eyes widened in shock as the camera 
flashed, someone had taken the opportunity to cup her rear firmly.

&quot;KINNEAS!&quot; She screeched, spinning around and slapping him.

&quot;CAD!&quot; Selphie squawked, she had no idea what he did but knew he 
probably deserved it and kicked him in the shin.

&quot;What&#146;d I do!?&quot; He yelped, trying to get away from the enraged women.

&quot;What the!?&quot; Zell laughed as he ran away, Quistis and Selphie chasing 
after him. Nicole sighed and retrieved the camera from Cid.

&quot;Thanks Sir.&quot; She said gratefully.

&quot;My pleasure.&quot; He smiled then walked over to Fujin.

Fujin watch the ensuing chaos with only the mildest of interest.

&quot;She&#146;s going to kill you.&quot; Cid said quietly.

&quot;WORTH IT.&quot; Fujin shrugged, glancing at him with a gleam in her eye.

&quot;Hey Fujin!&quot; Zell yelled obnoxiously charging over to her with an eager 
grin. Fujin readied herself for whatever mischief he was preparing.

&quot;Nicole&#146;s being a stick in the mud and Trepe is off killing Irvine. Come 
hit the dance floor, they&#146;re playing a bad ass song!&quot; He babbled.

Fujin looked him over as if he were mad.

&quot;Aw come on, all you gotta do is move with the beat.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin announced firmly.

&quot;Oh come on.&quot; Celest grinned, walking up to them. &quot;I&#146;ll go with you, the 
poor boy won&#146;t know what to do with himself.&quot; She giggled, wiggling her 
hips teasingly at him.

&quot;H-hey, what are you trying to do, get me killed!?&quot; He babbled, backing 
away from her.

Nicole and Rinoa were the only ones at their table and both were 
laughing as he bumbled around awkwardly.

&quot;I can see why Kevin left.&quot; Rinoa grinned. &quot;Celest is a lot to deal 
with.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s mean.&quot; Nicole said quietly.

&quot;I didn&#146;t mean it like that.&quot; Rinoa amended with sigh. &quot;I&#146;ve been 
sticking my foot in my mouth tonight.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s okay, it&#146;s been a trying evening for everyone. But at least we&#146;re 
having fun.&quot;

&quot;If you could call it that.&quot; Rinoa said with a faint smile.

&quot;I can&#146;t believe they&#146;re trying to get her to dance.&quot; Nicole chuckled as 
Celest and Zell were trying their damnedest to convince Fujin to go.

&quot;With all things considered, I&#146;d have seen weirder things tonight.&quot; 
Rinoa shrugged.

While not necessarily on the dance floor, an open area near the table 
served the purpose just as well. &quot;Come on, just do what I do.&quot; Celest 
said, standing next to Fujin and shaking her hips back and forth. Fujin 
however, wanted nothing more than to sit down.

&quot;Hey I can do that.&quot; Zell said laughingly, mimicking Celest&#146;s movements.

&quot;That&#146;s it.&quot; Celest giggled at the ridiculous sight as the two danced 
side by side.

&quot;Look at him.&quot; Rinoa snickered.

&quot;I know... I&#146;m dating a clown.&quot; Nicole sighed, smiling at him in spite 
of herself.

&quot;Come on, shake you&#146;re money maker!&quot; Zell laughed, dancing in circles 
around Fujin.

&quot;RETARDED.&quot; Fujin huffed, trying her best not to laugh.

&quot;What the hell are they doing?&quot; Quistis asked curiously as she made her 
way back to her seat.

&quot;Trying to get Fujin to dance.&quot; Nicole explained.

&quot;I think she&#146;ll kill them first.&quot; Rinoa added.

&quot;You&#146;d be right.&quot; Quistis nodded wisely.

&quot;Where&#146;s Irvine and Selphie?&quot; Nicole asked curiously.

&quot;Oh they ended up necking on the balcony.&quot; Quistis explained then stood 
back up. &quot;Let me go rescue her before they piss her off.&quot;

&quot;Good idea.&quot; Nicole giggled.

&quot;Okay guys, quit pestering my date.&quot; Quistis announced walking over and 
pushing Zell off balance as he was in a particularly off center 
movement. Searching hands and flailing limbs, he stumbled headlong into 
Celest, causing her yelp in surprise.

&quot;Watch the hands!&quot; She huffed, pushing him off her.

&quot;GAH!? Sorry, Sorry, Sorry!&quot;

&quot;ZELL.&quot; Nicole shouted in mock outrage.

&quot;It wasn&#146;t my fault!&quot; He yelped, raising his hands into the air, as if 
to show he was innocent.

Fujin rolled her eye and grinned at Quistis warmly.

&quot;RETURNED?&quot;

&quot;Yes, sorry, I had to beat Irvine to death.&quot;

&quot;I HEARD.&quot;

&quot;Well guys and gals.&quot; Celest said with a flourish. &quot;I think I&#146;ll be 
turning in. It&#146;s getting late and this is really a night for meant for 
couples.&quot;

&quot;Oh you don&#146;t have to go.&quot; Nicole pouted.

&quot;Yeah, I do. It&#146;s kinda weird being the fifth wheel and all.&quot; Celest 
shrugged graciously.

&quot;I&#146;ll walk with you. I think I&#146;ll call it quits too, I want check up on 
Squall.&quot; Rinoa smiled, standing up.

&quot;You&#146;re leaving too?&quot; Nicole frowned.

&quot;You two graduated, this is you&#146;re dance, don&#146;t leave now.&quot; Quistis 
frowned in disappointment.

&quot;Oh don&#146;t worry about it.&quot; Celest grinned, scampering over to hug her. 
&quot;Besides, Fujin graduated too.&quot; She added then hugged her also. Fujin 
stiffened from the unexpected embrace but played it off well.

&quot;Congratulations you two.&quot; Celest grinned then waved farewell to the 
others. Rinoa waved good bye as well and soon the two were chattering 
away as they left the dance hall.

&quot;What a night.&quot; Quistis shrugged, looking at Fujin thoughtfully before 
heading back to their seats.

**********************************

It was well beyond midnight by the time Quistis and Fujin made their way 
up the hall. Fujin, never one to drink was sober as a board. Quistis 
however was more than a bit tipsy and was whispering things in Fujin&#146;s 
ear that were more suited for the bedroom as she stumbled up the hall 
giggling madly.

&quot;OBLITERATED.&quot; Fujin chuckled.

&quot;I am not.&quot; Quistis huffed cutely.

&quot;BREATH SAYS OTHERWISE.&quot;

&quot;Hey that&#146;s mean.&quot; Quistis pouted, blowing into her palm curiously.

&quot;DRANK LIKE FISH.&quot;

&quot;Fish don&#146;t drink.&quot; She countered, sticking her tongue out at her.

&quot;INTERESTING NIGHT.&quot;

&quot;To put it mildly.&quot; Quistis nodded, growing a tad more serious, even 
though a giggle would bubble free on occasion.

&quot;SILLY.&quot; Fujin smirked.

&quot;Oh you had fun I know it.&quot;

&quot;A BIT.&quot;

&quot;Un huh.&quot; Quistis winked.

&quot;Quistis.&quot; A voice called quietly as they passed one of the vending 
rooms on the way to her apartment.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Quistis paused, looking around.

&quot;THERE.&quot; Fujin pointed, to the dimly lit room.

Backing up, they peeked in cautiously. Squall stood at one of the 
vending machines. He looked haggard and wore sweat pants and a T-shirt.

&quot;What are you doing up?&quot; Quistis asked curiously.

&quot;Drank to much.&quot; He grumbled, retrieving a bottle of aspirin from the 
machine.

&quot;Sorry to hear that, anything I can do?&quot;

&quot;Not really, but I&#146;d like to talk to you a moment.&quot; He said, nodding to 
a nearby table.

She glanced at Fujin worriedly; Squall was not one to kick up a chat.

Fujin shrugged quietly and nodded for her to go.

&quot;BE AT APARTMENT.&quot; Fujin said, not wanting to interrupt their talk.

&quot;It&#146;s okay, you can stay.&quot; Squall waved, blearily.

&quot;You sure you&#146;re okay?&quot; Quistis mumbled, sitting down.

&quot;Fine, I&#146;ve just been thinking is all.&quot; He said, fumbling with the 
aspirin bottle.

&quot;About?&quot; Quistis asked as Fujin sat down quietly nearby.

&quot;Well.&quot; He frowned then grunted in annoyance as he clawed at the 
stubborn container. Gently, Quistis took the bottle from him and 
motioned him to continue.

&quot;I&#146;ve realized a few things.&quot; He sighed, running a troubled hand through 
his hair.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Quistis said quietly, as she opened the bottle and handed it back 
to him.

&quot;Yeah, well, to be honest, I&#146;ve been and asshole.&quot; He sighed, causing 
Fujin to do a double take. Quistis however, sat quietly.

&quot;All the years I&#146;ve known you.&quot; He mumbled then paused to swallow a 
couple of the aspirin. &quot;I&#146;ve treated you like dirt haven&#146;t I?&quot; He 
frowned.

&quot;Squall, you&#146;re still drunk.&quot; Quistis smiled, patting his hand.

&quot;No, well, not much.&quot; He grumbled and shook his head as if to clear it. 
&quot;Just hear me out okay.&quot; He sighed.

&quot;Okay then.&quot; She nodded.

&quot;I don&#146;t think I ever thanked you for all the help you&#146;ve given me.&quot; He 
huffed, angry with himself.

&quot;That&#146;s not necessary.&quot; Quistis started but he cut her off.

&quot;Yeah it is, you&#146;ve taught me a lot. You were always there for me, when 
we were little. I remember now....&quot; He sighed and looked up, his brow 
furrowed with worry. Quistis hated to see him torment himself so but let 
him continue. It was obviously something that he needed to get out.

&quot;After sis left, you, more than anyone else were the one to look out for 
me.&quot; He continued, smiling faintly. &quot;Do you remember the night of my 
graduation?&quot; He said darkly, the brief smile vanishing into a frown.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Quistis said softly, not wishing to bring it up.

&quot;You were worried, about a lot of things, and came to me for support. 
You just wanted someone to talk to, to listen, and I ignored you. I&#146;m 
sorry about that. About a lot of things.&quot; He frowned, looking up at her. 
Quistis closed her eyes and took a breath.

&quot;Squall, it&#146;s in the past, don&#146;t trouble yourself over it. You&#146;ve 
changed, we all have.&quot; She smiled fondly.

&quot;Thanks Quistis, for everything.&quot; He said quietly, fumbling with the 
aspirin bottle awkwardly.

&quot;It&#146;s okay, seriously.&quot; She chuckled. &quot;Let&#146;s just put this behind us, 
okay.&quot; She winked.

&quot;Okay.&quot; He nodded, brightening slightly.

&quot;Good, now go to bed before you say something to embarrass yourself.&quot; 
She chuckled.

&quot;Yeah, you&#146;re right.&quot; He grumbled, running a hand through his tangled 
hair.

He rose to his feet and started to leave.

&quot;Good night you two.&quot; He paused, before heading back to his apartment.

&quot;Night.&quot; Quistis waved and Fujin nodded farewell. A moment past a 
Quistis sat in quiet reflection. Arms snaked around from behind her and 
Fujin rested her head on her shoulder.

&quot;OKAY?&quot; She asked quietly.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Quistis smiled, kissing her cheek fondly. &quot;Let&#146;s go home.&quot;</pre>
