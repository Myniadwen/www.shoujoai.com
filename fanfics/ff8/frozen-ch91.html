Rain, cold, pain, darkness. Fujin moaned softly as she slowly awoke. A 
dull throbbing pain raced through her, she was hurt, but the pain was 
everywhere, making it far to hard too focus on anything specific. The 
sound of falling water she realized was not rain, her vision cleared and 
she could see fire, through the haze of frosty and air and smoke. 
Overhead a large pipe, easily as big around as a large truck lay 
ruptured. It&#39;s contents spilling into a icy lake just inches away from 
her. Stunned, she forced herself to sit causing her body to scream in 
protest. Ice was dominant everywhere, massive sheets covered everything 
and large chunks floated amid the chill waters before her. Something was 
rotting in the water, fleshy and brackish, it&#39;s slug like form moldering 
quickly before her eyes. The gummy mass of flesh was infested with 
various cables, wires, and odd bits of machinery that served whatever 
unknown purpose.

&quot;Norg...&quot; She croaked feebly then froze. &quot;Quistis!&quot; She sputtered in 
shock turning abruptly. Behind her lay a massive pile of rubble, twisted 
steel and concrete rose like a small mountain, obviously the remnants of 
a large stairwell.

&quot;QUISTIS!&quot; She shouted, coughing up a spray of blood for her efforts. 
She could hardly breath, each breath was ragged and tortured, she could 
feel the warm spread of blood soaking her shirt as she drug herself 
towards the rubble.

&quot;NO!&quot; She screeched her gaze wide in horror.

&quot;NOT REAL! NOT!&quot;

Something exploded overhead; showering her with small bits of mortar and 
debris. Looking up in a panic induced stupor, she winced as a bright 
beam of light shone onto her.

&quot;There&#39;s someone here!&quot; A familiar voice shouted.

&quot;SQUALL!&quot; Fujin cried in dismay. &quot;HELP PLEASE!&quot;

&quot;Fujin!? Hold on, we&#39;re coming down? Where&#39;s Quistis?&quot;

&quot;I DON&#39;T KNOW!&quot;

After calling forth the proper spell, Squall floated down to meet her, 
as did Zell who looked haggard with worry.

&quot;HELP ME!&quot; Fujin shouted anew, clawing at the rubble.

&quot;Oh Hyne...&quot; Zell mouthed in horror.

&quot;What?&quot; Squall frowned, following his gaze, what he saw caused him to 
stagger backwards in shock. Slowly, Fujin&#39;s followed their gaze. Knowing 
what she&#39;d find, her heart pounded in her chest with the force of a 
sledgehammer. An arm protruded from the rubble, pale and horribly 
savaged. Thankfully, before she could take in the rest of the hellish 
site she fainted.

A hoarse, scream caused Quistis to bolt awake with a start, the sound 
was nothing that she&#39;d ever heard before and something she prayed never 
to hear again. Pulling herself up, she found Fujin sitting up, knees 
against her chest and crying miserably.

&quot;Fu!?&quot; Quistis called out shakily. A wracking sob answered her.

&quot;Fu, baby are you okay, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Quistis frowned, cradling her 
gently. At first Fujin was unresponsive then slowly, she tilted her head 
to regard her. A look of relief crossed her tortured features as Quistis 
caring gaze met hers. Sniffling softly she offered a grim smile.

&quot;BAD DREAM.&quot; She murmured quietly.

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Quistis shushed her, gently biding her to lie beside her. 
&quot;I&#39;m here.&quot;

*****************************

The next morning found Xu and Nida stood on Balamb&#39;s bridge staring out 
over the plush canopy of trees passing below. She, typing steadily on 
her portable computer while he lazily manned the helm.

&quot;I&#39;m getting old.&quot; She sighed, setting the laptop aside.

&quot;Nonsense.&quot; Nida chuckled.

&quot;So you say.&quot; She frowned, slipping a small, stylish pair of reading 
glasses out of her pocket. Donning them, she went back to her work.

&quot;Okay perhaps you are.&quot; He laughed. &quot;When did you start wearing those?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve always had them but I&#39;ve hardly needed them.&quot; She sighed. &quot;But 
lately I need find I need them more and more.&quot;

&quot;At least they&#39;re cute.&quot; He offered

&quot;Oh shut up.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; He laughed. &quot;You&#39;re not old, heck; you&#39;re not even thirty.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m close!&quot;

&quot;Oh come now, you&#39;re not that close.&quot;

&quot;Easy for you to say, you&#39;re barely old enough to drink.&quot;

&quot;Hey don&#39;t yell at me. You&#39;re the one going after the young guys you 
cradle robber.&quot;

&quot;Cradle robber! You make me sound like an old maid!&quot; She all but 
shrieked while swatting at him. He ducked and Balamb lurked slightly.

&quot;Hey! I&#39;m driving here!&quot; He laughed as Xu put a startled hand over her 
mouth.

&quot;You&#39;re evil.&quot; She snapped in a tiff.

Nearby, the bridge crew listened to the exchange in amusement. Xu, 
catching their careful glances glared at them.

&quot;What are you jokers looking at?&quot;

&quot;Um, an old maid?&quot; One of the bolder members chuckled under his breath.

&quot;I heard that!&quot; Xu bristled sourly as Nida burst into laughter.

&quot;What are you laughing at?&quot; Xu scowled playfully, slapping him in the 
back of the head.

&quot;Ugh, I&#39;ve had it with you clowns I&#39;m going to get breakfast.&quot; She 
sighed, gathering her things.

&quot;Bring me a bagel.&quot; Nida asked.

&quot;Nope, you&#39;ve been a jerk.&quot; She said kissing his cheek.

&quot;Aw Xu come on.&quot; He frowned.

&quot;Uh uh&quot; She said snottily, heading towards the elevator.

&quot;Darn it.&quot; Nida sighed, looking over at the bridge crew in annoyance. 
&quot;Thanks guys now I&#39;m in trouble.&quot;

************************************

Zell was bouncing in his seat, today was the day he got to pick up the 
honeymooners and he was more than eager to see his friends again.

&quot;Stop fidgeting.&quot; Nicole mumbled, quietly nibbling a croissant.

&quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;When do you go pick them up?&quot;

&quot;Ah, not till this evening.&quot; He sighed.

&quot;Then relax, it&#39;s not even noon yet.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m cool, really.&quot;

&quot;Un huh, right. Look, Xu says we&#39;re heading over the tropics today, it&#39;s 
going to be a beautiful day, we should head out to the pool and take 
advantage of it.&quot;

&quot;Pool?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you know, big hole, filled with water, people got there for 
recreation.&quot; She said with sly grin.

&quot;I know what a pool is.&quot; He huffed.

&quot;Morning ladies.&quot; Seifer crowed appearing behind them. &quot;Chicken wuss, 
how&#39;s it hanging?&quot; He added jostling Zell briskly.

&quot;You asshole, go away.&quot; Zell snapped.

&quot;Boys be nice.&quot; Celest sighed. &quot;Care if we join you?&quot;

&quot;Actually!&quot; Zell grumbled.

&quot;You&#39;d be more than welcome.&quot; Nicole finished for him.

Seifer plopped down heavily in front of Zell and smiled at him 
sinisterly.

&quot;Hey, you got a hotdog.&quot; He noted then reached for it with his fork. 
With a speed honed from years of martial arts training, Zell intercepted 
the purloining utensil with his own.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so.&quot; He sneered.

&quot;Oh ho.&quot; Seifer grinned as if accepting an unspoken challenge.&quot;

&quot;For the love of.&quot; Celest sighed in annoyance. Quickly, she grabbed the 
debated frank and quickly devoured it. Then, as if nothing happened she 
turned to chat with Nicole.

&quot;My dog...&quot; Zell mumbled in shock. Seifer blinked and sat back in his 
seat.

&quot;Um, okay...&quot; He mouthed with a startled shrug.

************************

&quot;Wake up! Ya sleep like the dead ya know!&quot; Raijin bellowed, shaking the 
bed mightily. Truthfully, Jaya could have indeed passed for a corpse, so 
deep was her slumber.

&quot;Jaya, Jaya, Jaya, Jaya!&quot; Raijin babbled repeatedly, pushing up and down 
on her shoulders. A knock on the bedroom door caused him to pause.

&quot;What?&quot; Raijin sighed. &quot;Come in.&quot;

Miguel poked his head through the door questioningly.

&quot;You have learned nothing?&quot; He chuckled.

&quot;Miguel I&#39;m leaving, I&#39;m late for work.&quot; A woman&#39;s echoed from somewhere 
behind him.

&quot;Farewell.&quot; He smiled, leaning back out to wave goodbye.

Raijin rushed to the door to peer over the older man&#39;s shoulder. A leggy 
brunette was hurriedly putting on her shoes and musing with her hair. 
Then quickly, she rushed out the door and was gone.

&quot;Who the hell was that?&quot; Raijin blurted.

Miguel looked confused for a moment.

&quot;I did not catch her name.&quot; He shrugged helplessly. Raijin made a face.

&quot;You&#39;re worse than Seifer.&quot;

&quot;I do not think so, from what you have told me, he does not love his 
women.&quot;

&quot;Oh and I suppose you do.&quot; Raijin laughed.

Miguel looked genuinely insulted and pushed past to enter the room.

&quot;Of course I do.&quot; He said sourly then clapped his hands briskly. &quot;Jaya 
wake up.&quot; He said in a firm fatherly tone.

Yawning cutely Jaya rolled over and opened her eyes.

&quot;Morning.&quot; She smiled dreamily.

&quot;You two are weird ya know.&quot; Raijin said, cutting Miguel and foul look.

*****************

By the time Quistis and Fujin arrived in the cafeteria the place was 
packed.

&quot;DAMN.&quot; Fujin wowed, never before had she seen the place full.

&quot;Well, whatever they&#39;re serving must be good.&quot; Quistis shrugged from her 
wheelchair.

&quot;MUST BE.&quot; Fujin added pushing Quistis&#39; chair forward as they got in 
line. To their mutual surprise a horde of Treppies rushed forward and 
fawned over Quistis worriedly, even more surprising was the fact that 
half of them Quistis didn&#39;t even know.

&quot;Miss Trepe, it&#39;s been so long are you okay, will you be back in 
class!?&quot; One girl babbled worriedly.

&quot;Hey, hey Miss Trepe, we knew nothing could keep you down.&quot; An energetic 
young man chuckled.

&quot;Oh wow she, is, hot!&quot; Another youth whispered to his gawking companion.

&quot;Oh my.&quot; Quistis blushed, laughing brightly.

&quot;STILL HAVE IT.&quot; Fujin smirked.

Quistis beamed and quieted them all down.

&quot;Gracious, where did all the new faces come from?&quot; She giggled.

&quot;Well Ma&#39;am, it&#39;s not fair to the newbies that didn&#39;t get to meet you so 
we really pushed the fan club.&quot; Nei, one of Quistis prize students from 
Fujin&#39;s class said laughingly.

&quot;Tell her about the shirts.&quot; One boy laughed.

&quot;Shirts...?&quot; Quistis gawked. &quot;Oh no, please tell me you didn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;GAVE ME ONE.&quot; Fujin said blandly.

Quistis buried her face in her hands with a blushing squeak.

&quot;To be honest.&quot; Nei laughed. &quot;Your picture was more than enough to bring 
most over to the club.&quot;

&quot;Oh my goodness!&quot; Quistis laughed brightly. &quot;You guys will be the death 
of me.&quot;

&quot;QUISTIS ROLE MODEL.&quot; Fujin said proudly.

&quot;Hardly.&quot; Quistis scoffed.

&quot;She&#39;s right Ma&#39;am.&quot; Nei smiled. &quot;You&#39;re an inspiration; you saved our 
home and took care of us.&quot;

&quot;Yeah Miss Trepe you took charge and kicked that things ass!&quot; Another 
youth shouted from in the small crowd. That was the tipping point and 
soon the gathering was chanting Quistis&#39; last name as if at a student 
rally. Blushing profusely she couldn&#39;t help but smile warmly.

&quot;THEY LOVE YOU.&quot; Fujin noted quietly.

&quot;I love them too.&quot; Quistis grinned. &quot;They&#39;re my children.&quot;

*****************************

&quot;Well look at here, sleeping beauty honors us with her presence.&quot; Seifer 
snorted as Quistis and Fujin approached.

&quot;BLOW OUT ASS.&quot; Fujin retorted.

&quot;Fujin please, Seifer, shut up.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;We saved you a spot!&quot; Zell said eagerly, waving them over.

&quot;Thanks Zell, how are you?&quot; Quistis asked as she settled into position.

Satisfied that she was comfortable Fujin joined her.

&quot;I&#39;m great, looking forward to picking up the Squallster.&quot; He said 
eagerly. &quot;I bet Rinoa has a fit when she finds out you&#39;re okay.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t wait to see Selphie.&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;Oh my goodness!&quot; Nicole laughed. &quot;Poor thing can barely walk, she looks 
like a basketball.&quot;

Seifer laughed aloud at the mental image.

&quot;Nikki&#39;s right.&quot; Celest agreed. &quot;She&#39;s about to pop, she should be do 
any day now actually.&quot;

&quot;Do we know what it&#39;ll be?&quot; Quistis asked.

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot; Fujin answered, causing everyone to look at her 
questioningly.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; She snapped.

&quot;How the heck do you know?&quot; Zell gawked.

Fujin said nothing.

&quot;She&#39;s a nurse.&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;AM NOT.&quot; Fujin huffed.

&quot;A nurse...&quot; Seifer said quietly, his eyes wide.

&quot;SILENCE&quot; She blurted, knowing he was about to say something snide.

He couldn&#39;t contain his laughter even if he wanted to and let it out in 
a long bellowing chuckle that sounded more befitting some evil Count in 
a horror movie.

&quot;Sorry.&quot; Quistis shirked as Fujin rolled her eyes.

&quot;ORDERLY.&quot; She explained sourly.

&quot;Disorderly.&quot; Zell mumbled jokingly.

&quot;Behave.&quot; Nicole shushed him.

&quot;You have the little hat?&quot; Seifer asked, still laughing.

&quot;Ignore him.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;Where&#39;s the hat?&quot; Seifer giggled again then choked on his food.

&quot;HA!&quot; Fujin blurted abruptly then resumed her own meal gleefully as 
Celest proceed to beat the ever living hell out of Seifer&#39;s back in 
hopes of dislodging whatever was choking him.

&quot;Whoa, he&#39;s turning blue...&quot; Zell said in awe.

&quot;That&#39;s not funny.&quot; Quistis frowned. &quot;Fujin go help him, before she 
beats him to death.&quot;

Fujin rolled her eye and stood to assist.

&quot;Yo guys sorry we&#39;re late!&quot; Raijin bellowed as he pushed his wide frame 
through the tightly packed crowd of chairs and diners.

&quot;Is he well?&quot; Miguel said curiously, noticing Seifer&#39;s dilemma.

Fujin was about around the table when Celest&#39;s beating had its desired 
effect. With a choking hack the offending blockage arced neatly through 
the air and into Raijin&#39;s plate.

&quot;Aw that&#146;s just gross ya know.&quot; He scowled is disappointment.

&quot;Disgusting.&quot; Jaya winced, stepping slightly away from him.

&quot;Thanks...&quot; Seifer coughed as Celest watched with concern.

&quot;Hell, I&#39;ll be back, gonna get another plate.&quot; Raijin sighed as Miguel 
commandeered a recently vacated table and slid it nearby.

&quot;It&#39;s like living with a bunch of kids.&quot; Quistis mumbled. Fujin gave an 
agreeing nod.

&quot;Hey guys, we&#39;re heading to pool later, you have to come hang out.&quot; Zell 
said eagerly.

&quot;Most assuredly.&quot; Miguel smiled wolfishly. &quot;With such ladies present it 
will be a treat.&quot;

&quot;A man after my own heart.&quot; Seifer chuckled.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Celest scowled. &quot;I think he&#39;s a bad influence on you. You&#39;re both 
sounding like my brother.&quot;

&quot;I still can&#39;t imagine you being related to that hillbilly.&quot; Seifer 
chuckled. Celest didn&#39;t take the comment lightly and promptly poured her 
drink in his lap.

&quot;What the hell?&quot; He blurted jumping up in shock.

Quistis shook her head in defeat.

&quot;You deserved it.&quot; Jaya grinned as he padded at his lap with napkins.

&quot;Need a diaper?&quot; Zell chuckled.

&quot;Hey, I&#39;ll deal with you later!&quot; Seifer barked.

&quot;What the devil are you guys doing over here?&quot; Xu growled in wonder, 
holding her tray. Nida surveyed the scene as well and sighed.

&quot;I think everyone is going stir crazy.&quot; Nicole smiled.

Celest stood and smiled politely. &quot;Xu you can have my chair, I&#39;ve some 
errands to do so.&quot;

Seifer stood as well, still fuming over his doused trousers.

&quot;Celest.&quot; Quistis called, motioning to her.

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;We need to talk.&quot;

&quot;Okies, we well, see you this afternoon.&quot; The younger woman said 
evasively then hurried off with Seifer hot on her heels steadily 
complaining. Xu and Nida took the now empty seats and sat down 
curiously.

&quot;We miss anything?&quot; Xu asked.

&quot;Just Seifer being a jerk.&quot; Zell groaned.

&quot;What else is new?&quot; Nida smirked. &quot;At least he&#39;s gone now.&quot;

&quot;You do not like him?&quot; Jaya asked curiously.

&quot;No one does.&quot; He answered dully.

&quot;Then why does he come around?&quot;

&quot;Hell if we know, he&#39;s like a big roach or something.&quot; Zell laughed.

&quot;Zell...&quot; Quistis said quietly.

&quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;At least he&#39;s trying to get along.&quot; Nicole said optimistically causing 
Fujin to huff in discontent.

Changing the subject Zell turned to Quistis with a gleam in his eyes.

&quot;You two should come out with me to pick up Squall and the gang.&quot;

&quot;Hey that&#146;s a good idea.&quot; Nicole beamed.

&quot;Yeah it&#39;ll be a surprise!&quot; Zell nodded eagerly.

&quot;Sure, I&#39;d love to.&quot; Quistis giggled cheerfully then turned to Fujin. 
&quot;What about you?&quot;

&quot;AS YOU WISH.&quot; She shrugged impassively.

****************************

The day was warm and all was calm. With a group of junior SEED&#39;s 
returning from a successful venture everyone was in good spirits and 
celebrated. So it was of little wonder that the pool was packed with 
frolicking youths and lounging staff. In a more secluded area, towards 
one end of the massive pool sat a group of figures, all of who watched a 
drama being played out on a group of tumbling mats.

Two men circled each other slowly, sizing one another up while the ring 
of observers watched. Seifer, Raijin, both grandstanding, and both 
having something to prove to the ladies watching intently. Or so they 
thought.

&quot;Why are we watching this?&quot; Celest grumbled, fidgeting with her swimsuit 
sourly.

&quot;Because you want to indulge their macho nonsense.&quot; Xu yawned watching 
with interest as a new batch of barbecued ribs was thrown onto the 
nearby grills.

&quot;That&#146;s a little harsh.&quot; Nicole frowned at Xu&#39;s comment as she sipped 
quietly on a lime daiquiri.

&quot;Fight me then.&quot; Xu grinned, cutting her a sarcastic look.

&quot;They&#39;re just doing what comes naturally.&quot; Jaya smiled, the lust evident 
in her eyes as she watched the men square off.

&quot;Ladies please.&quot; Quistis sighed from her lounge chair as she soaked up 
the sunrays.

&quot;I think it&#39;s cute. They&#39;re just showing off.&quot; Nicole grinned as Raijin 
ran past, holding Seifer in the air like a sack of potatoes.

&quot;Hey, let em cut loose, we needed some fun around here.&quot; Zell shrugged 
as he padded towards them with a freshly grilled hamburger.

&quot;You are fighter also?&quot; Miguel asked curiously.

&quot;Yeah I suppose so.&quot; Zell answered modestly.

&quot;Come then, let us battle.&quot; Miguel chuckled brightly, his craggy eyes 
dancing as he unbuttoned his shirt to reveal a broad powerful chest.

&quot;What?&quot; Zell balked; his mouth full of grilled cheeseburger.

&quot;WUSS.&quot; Fujin snorted, from beside Quistis.

&quot;The man&#39;s a friggin bear, you fight him.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll do no such thing.&quot; Quistis scolded, looking at him from over her 
sunglasses.

&quot;I do not fight women.&quot; Miguel smiled wolfishly. &quot;They are for other 
things.&quot;

&quot;Oh for the love of...&quot; Quistis groaned. &quot;Raijin! Where the hell did you 
find this guy?&quot; She shouted laughingly. &quot;Zell, go kick his butt!&quot; She 
blurted, shoving him in the back with her foot.

&quot;Yes, Ma&#39;am!&quot; Zell shouted eagerly then tackled the larger man.

&quot;You&#39;re actually encouraging this.&quot; Xu asked curiously.

&quot;Of course.&quot; Quistis grinned. &quot;Now that the boys are gone we can have a 
little chat. Celest get over here!&quot;

&quot;Crap.&quot; Celest winced. &quot;Aw Quistis what did I do now?&quot;

&quot;Nothing, nothing, sit down.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s this about?&quot;

&quot;GOSSIP.&quot; Fujin huffed.

&quot;Yeah Celest, what&#39;s up?&quot; Xu asked inquisitively.

&quot;Hi guys.&quot; Ellone beamed, unwittingly interrupting the interrogation as 
she plopped down beside Quistis&#39; lounger.

&quot;Ellone, hi, we missed you at breakfast.&quot; Quistis smiled warmly.

&quot;I know, I&#39;m sorry I overslept.&quot;

&quot;Well at least you&#39;re here now; it&#39;d be a shame for you to miss a day 
like this.&quot;

&quot;Speaking of which, where&#39;s you suit.&quot; Celest wondered curiously, noting 
her simple blouse and modest skirt.

&quot;I didn&#39;t have one.&quot; Ellone explained as she slipped off her shoes and 
dipped her feet in the water.

&quot;You should have come to me, I would have loaned you one.&quot; Celest said.

&quot;Don&#39;t do it.&quot; Xu mumbled.

&quot;You shut up.&quot; Celest barked.

&quot;THONG.&quot; Fujin added dully.

&quot;You too!&quot; Celest snapped again. Ellone giggled brightly and regarded 
Celest graciously.

&quot;Thanks but I&#39;m okay.&quot;

&quot;Ah well.&quot; Celest shrugged then began to stand.

&quot;Hold on there.&quot; Quistis said quickly as Nicole and Xu grabbed her arms.

&quot;Oh come on.&quot; Celest whined, sitting back down.

&quot;You&#39;re not getting away that easy.&quot; Xu chuckled.

Zell and Miguel&#39;s antics enveloped Seifer and Raijins&#39; as well and soon 
all four men spilled into the water with a loud splash. Annoyed that her 
entertainment was foiled Jaya turned around to listen to the ensuing 
gossip.

&quot;Come on Celest, rumor says you&#39;re up to something big.&quot; Nicole grinned.

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Celest said, feigning innocence.

&quot;Something&#39;s brewing between you and Seifer.&quot; Xu explained further.

&quot;We&#39;re dating now, but that&#146;s common knowledge.&quot; Celest shrugged. Fujin 
made a noise but a gentle look from Quistis quieted her.

&quot;Oh wow, really?!&quot; Ellone blinked in surprise, earning a questioning 
look from everyone.

&quot;Um...sorry, I&#39;m kinda out of the loop.&quot; She squeaked then motioned for 
them to continue.

&quot;There&#39;s nothing to tell.&quot; Celest mumbled awkwardly, uneasy at being 
under so much scrutiny.

&quot;Dating eh, interesting.&quot; Xu prodded. &quot;Have you two, you know?&quot; She 
grinned salaciously.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Celest gawked in shock.

&quot;Oh dear.&quot; Nicole blushed as Quistis&#39; eyes widen slightly but remained 
quiet while Fujin decided to go investigate the potential for freshly 
grilled goodies.

&quot;Um, did what?&quot; Ellone asked innocently, earning yet another look from 
the girls present.

&quot;Sex.&quot; Jaya explained in a tone that was annoying similar to that used 
when mothers explained things to children.

&quot;Oh, okay.&quot; Ellone blushed then took a long draw from Quistis&#39; drink in 
an attempt to appear unfazed.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Quistis complained.

&quot;Ack!&quot; Ellone jumped, waving her hands in a mix of embarrassment and 
confusion &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She groaned in dismay.

&quot;Jeeze.&quot; Xu snorted, trying not to laugh.

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Quistis smiled. &quot;You can have it.&quot;

Nicole took an understanding breath and remained quiet.

&quot;I&#39;ll uh, just sit here, um...go on, just ignore me...&quot; Ellone mumbled 
meekly.

With the minor drama resolved, Xu turned back to Celest who looked more 
than eager to run away.

&quot;No.&quot; Celest said bluntly. &quot;Not that it&#39;s any of your business.&quot;

&quot;Ouch!&quot; Xu winced.

&quot;And you deserved it.&quot; Quistis smiled, then regarded Celest 
thoughtfully.

&quot;We&#39;re just worried hon, that&#146;s all.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, but I&#39;m a big gal.&quot; Celest responded somewhat defensively.

&quot;Do not be mad at her. Seifer, he is handsome man.&quot; Jaya commented.

&quot;Oh no doubt, he&#39;s a stud, but lets face facts, he&#39;s a jerk.&quot; Xu 
scowled.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Celest protested.

&quot;Oh be nice you two, honestly though I have to agree, he&#39;s pretty 
dashing in a rugged sort of way.&quot; Nicole grinned, blushing slightly.

&quot;Better not let Zell hear you say that, you&#39;ll break his little heart.&quot; 
Quistis chuckled.

&quot;What, you don&#39;t agree?&quot; Xu asked.

&quot;Hardly my type.&quot; Quistis shrugged.

&quot;Hey you don&#39;t count anyway.&quot; Celest snapped sarcastically.

&quot;That was a cheap shot.&quot; Quistis scowled slightly.

&quot;That was cold.&quot; Xu agreed then regarded Ellone. &quot;What do you think?&quot;

&quot;Um, who me?&quot; Ellone balked.

&quot;Yeah you.&quot;

&quot;It was kind of a tacky comment.&quot;

&quot;Not that you goof, Seifer.&quot;

&quot;Oh, him, um, I guess he&#39;s okay.&quot; She shrugged.

&quot;Can we not talk about him like he&#39;s a side of beef please?&quot; Celest 
finally blurted.

&quot;Defensive little thing isn&#39;t she.&quot; Xu said in surprise.

&quot;Oh quit tormenting her.&quot; Nicole scolded.

&quot;Really Xu, reign it in a little.&quot; Quistis agreed.

&quot;Okay, sorry.&quot; Xu sighed, rolling her eyes.

&quot;Pardon her, she&#39;s got heat dementia.&quot; Quistis explained jokingly.

&quot;I&#39;m leaving.&quot; Celest blurted.

&quot;You&#39;re leaving, but it&#39;s still early.&quot; Nicole frowned.

&quot;Oh hey, I didn&#39;t mean to run you off.&quot; Xu said apologetically. &quot;I was 
just picking with you.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s not what I mean.&quot; Celest explained.

&quot;She is coming with us.&quot; Jaya piped in cheerfully causing everyone to 
look at her in shock.

&quot;Huh, you mean you&#39;re leaving, leaving?&quot; Quistis stammered.

Celest winced.

&quot;Oh my.&quot; Nicole gasped lightly as Fujin returned with a paper plate full 
of barbecued ribs.

&quot;You&#39;re shitting us?&quot; Xu blurted in shock, caught completely caught off 
guard.

&quot;Are you serious?&quot; Nicole prodded further.

&quot;Well, to be honest...&quot; Celest shirked. &quot;Yes, yes I am, we&#39;ll be leaving 
the day after tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re just up and leaving Balamb, just like that?&quot; Xu stammered.

&quot;Yup.&quot; Celest shrugged.

Fujin&#39;s expression darkened as she began to get the gist of the 
conversation. Quistis was floored and it showed as she took off her 
sunglasses.

&quot;This is a surprise...&quot; She managed through the lingering shock. &quot;What 
made you decided to do this?&quot; She asked, concerned.

&quot;Seifer asked me to.&quot; Celest smiled, giving him a wave. Seifer paused 
enough to smile back and was promptly tackled anew.

&quot;IDIOT.&quot; Fujin sputtered, shaking her head.

&quot;Well that&#146;s one opinion.&quot; Celest shrugged.

&quot;Oh Wow.&quot; Xu mumbled. &quot;This is a kick in the shorts.&quot;

&quot;Yeah really.&quot; Nicole nodded in a stupor.

&quot;How long will you be gone?&quot; Quistis asked, concerned.

&quot;I have no idea.&quot; Celest shrugged with a relaxed smile.

&quot;What will you do?&quot; Xu frowned.

&quot;Anything we want, see the world, help people, whatever.&quot;

&quot;BUMS.&quot; Fujin snorted.

&quot;I resent that.&quot; Jaya scowled.

&quot;TRUTH.&quot; Fujin scoffed.

&quot;You are a rude woman. Speak not to me.&quot; Jaya huffed, ignoring her.

&quot;Fujin, please.&quot; Quistis whispered, touching her shoulder lightly.

&quot;APOLOGY...&quot; Fujin sighed.

&quot;Accepted.&quot; Jaya nodded, obviously vindicated.

&quot;Look, I was kinda hoping you guys would happy for me.&quot; Celest pouted. 
&quot;You all know a girl has to make her own path at some point. Hell, I&#39;m 
tired of doing what everyone expects of me, I want to be spontaneous!&quot; 
She said with a giddy flourish.

&quot;Then dye your hair, get a tattoo, go streaking, do anything but run off 
half cocked. I mean surely you&#39;ve not had the time to give this much 
thought.&quot; Quistis offered worriedly.

&quot;That&#39;s the whole point!&quot; Celest giggled, causing Jaya to giggle as 
well.

&quot;It is great fun; we will see the world and do many things.&quot; She 
laughed, spreading her arms excitedly.

&quot;Oh Hyne.&quot; Ellone giggled. &quot;You go girl.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t encourage her.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;I think it&#39;s neat.&quot; Nicole finally commented after much deliberation. 
&quot;I wish I could be so spontaneous, but I&#39;m to big a chicken.&quot;

&quot;Well thanks you two, at least someone sees where I&#39;m coming from.&quot;

&quot;Easy hon, no ones against the idea.&quot; Quistis started while Fujin 
coughed in protest. &quot;Well...uh...anyway, what I was say is, that you 
should think this out, it&#39;s a big decision.&quot;

&quot;Quisty, I&#39;m flattered you&#39;re worried but, like I said, I&#39;m a big girl, 
I&#39;ll be okay.&quot;

&quot;Do you love him?&quot; Xu said, asking the question most were avoiding. 
Celest frowned thoughtfully then shrugged slightly.

&quot;Perhaps, I dunno... but I want to find out. This way we&#39;ll have to time 
to explore.&quot;

Fujin shook her head but stayed silent.

&quot;Okay then.&quot; Quistis sighed, obviously disappointed but resigned to 
respect her decision. &quot;Looks like you made up your mind. What are you 
going to tell Irvine, how do you think he&#39;ll react.&quot;

&quot;SEIFER DEAD.&quot; Fujin mumbled.

&quot;That&#146;s an understatement I bet.&quot; Xu chuckled.

&quot;Her brother yes?&quot; Jaya asked curiously.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;Then he will be supportive.&quot;

&quot;If you say so.&quot; Xu whistled.

&quot;Oh he&#39;ll be fine; Irvine&#39;s a laid back kind of guy.&quot; Nicole said 
optimistically.

&quot;It&#39;s funny.&quot; Ellone giggled quaintly.

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis asked curiously.

&quot;Nothing really, it&#39;s just all this talk about Seifer brought back some 
memories.&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Celest said arching a brow. &quot;You two have a history? He 
never told me.&quot;

&quot;Interesting.&quot; Jaya smiled scandalously.

&quot;It&#39;s not what you think.&quot; Quistis explained quickly sensing some 
growing tension.

&quot;Oh, no, no.&quot; Ellone giggled, shaking her head. &quot;I used to baby sit 
these guys when I was younger.

&quot;What?&quot; Nicole and Celest gawked.

&quot;Oh yes it&#39;s true.&quot; Ellone smiled briskly.

&quot;NEVER TOLD.&quot; She frowned.

&quot;Yeah, Trepe.&quot; Xu added sourly

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, it never came up.&quot; Quistis shirked.

Glad to finally have something interesting to talk about, Ellone eagerly 
scooted forward to share.

&quot;Yeah it was hilarious.&quot; She winked at Fujin. &quot;They were a terror, oh 
and Quistis, you were such a snobby little thing.&quot; She giggled. &quot;Um... 
no offense.&quot;

Quistis only smiled. &quot;Look who my peers were.&quot; She shrugged, nodding 
towards Seifer who was roaring like gorilla in heat while shoving Raijin 
under the water.

&quot;Oh and poor Seifer, he was such a bed wetter.&quot; Ellone grinned, watching 
them roughhouse.

&quot;SEIFER WET BED?&quot; Fujin snorted.

&quot;Oh yes, like every night, it was horrible, I had to wash his sheets 
constantly because he didn&#39;t want Edea to know.&quot;

&quot;Great...&quot; Celest groaned.

&quot;Too much info.&quot; Xu mouthed while Nicole and Quistis exchanged glances. 
Fujin meanwhile sat back on her hands and basked in her own humorous 
thoughts.

&quot;He was like six years old.&quot; Ellone said in his defense.

&quot;Does he still?&quot; Jaya asked Celest curiously. &quot;The tents, they are 
cramped.&quot;

&quot;How the heck should I know!?&quot; Celest barked evasively.

&quot;Well kiddies, it&#39;s about that time!&quot; Zell announced clamoring out of 
the water. Seifer, Miguel and Raijin soon joined him; all were panting 
and laughing heartily. Seifer felt a chill and looked to Fujin who was 
eyeing him with an intense and downright sinister grin.

&quot;What the hell&#39;s your problem?&quot; He asked, somewhat spooked.

&quot;BED WETTER.&quot; She said, slow and deliberately, her lips curling into a 
wicked smile.

*******************

All was calm on the Ragnarok, which Quistis found far more enjoyable 
than the anarchy Fujin&#39;s comment caused. Zell was at the controls, 
steadily singing out of tune with some loud, erratic rock band, while 
Fujin sat at her side wearing a catty, satisfied grin.

&quot;You should see yourself.&quot; Quistis said quietly.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Fujin mumbled, looking to her curiously.

&quot;He had a fit.&quot;

&quot;WAS GOAL.&quot;

&quot;It was mean.&quot;

&quot;DESERVED IT.&quot;

&quot;True, but still, you made an ass out of him. Zell and Raijin will never 
stop hounding him now.&quot;

&quot;EVEN BETTER.&quot;

&quot;You have a cruel streak; I hope you are aware of that.&quot;

&quot;YES.&quot;

&quot;Good, just so you know.&quot;

&quot;THANK YOU.&quot;

&quot;So bad...&quot; Quistis sighed, chuckling to herself.

&quot;How are you lovely ladies doing back there?&quot; Zell asked, turning to 
face them sporting two black eyes and a silly grin.

&quot;Oh jeeze.&quot; Quistis laughed at the sight of him. &quot;You really should&#39;ve 
gotten fixed up before we left.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m alright, besides it was worth it.&quot; Zell smiled merrily.

&quot;So long as you&#39;re good to fly.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m cool, I&#39;m cool. Fujin, tell her.&quot;

&quot;HE&#39;S COOL.&quot; Fujin answered blandly so he&#39;d shut up.

&quot;See.&quot; He smiled, giving two thumbs up.

&quot;How much farther do we have to go Mr Cool?&quot; Quistis asked.

&quot;On approach now.&quot; He answered, as the Ragnarok easily made the 
transition into space. A low electric buzz filled the cockpit as the 
ship&#39;s antigravity system came into effect. Once positive that she was 
not going to be bouncing off the walls, Fujin undid he seatbelt and 
moved closer to the windows to peer out.

&quot;BEAUTIFUL.&quot; She mouthed in awe.

&quot;Oh neat, this is your first time going up isn&#39;t it?&quot; Quistis smiled.

Fujin nodded eagerly, her gaze dancing with child like wonder.

Quistis watched her warmly, smiling brightly as Fujin scampered forward 
and leaned over Zell&#39;s seat to gaze upward from the cockpit as a massive 
vessel passed over them.

&quot;Pretty cool huh?&quot; Zell grinned.

Fujin nodded speechless.

&quot;That&#146;s a cargo vessel.&quot; He explained as he turned the ship slightly. 
&quot;And that.&quot; He said pointing ahead. &quot;Is our destination. The Grandia.&quot;

&quot;AMAZING.&quot; Fujin gawked at the colossal station as it came into view. 
The structure was easily larger than Balamb but shared a similar 
artistic flair. Large portions of the resort housed gleaming blue tinted 
solar panels that mixed form and functionality. Overall the resort 
looked something similar to a great diamond spinning lazily in space.

&quot;Oh wow.&quot; Quistis said in surprise. &quot;They&#39;ve came a long way, I didn&#39;t 
even know this place was open yet.&quot;

&quot;Well, you&#39;ve um, been away for awhile. They opened for business last 
month.&quot; Zell explained.

&quot;OPULENT.&quot; Fujin said quietly.

&quot;Very, but hey, if you can afford it, why not.&quot; Quistis shrugged.

&quot;To rich for my blood.&quot; Zell chuckled as he brought the ship around to 
one of the exit docks.

Fujin returned to her seat and looked at Quistis smilingly as Zell made 
docking procedures. Finally after a lengthy wait, the ship docked and 
the airlock cycled.

&quot;We&#39;re here.&quot; Zell announced climbing out of his seat. &quot;You ladies wait 
here I&#39;ll go round up the love birds.&quot; He said eagerly, bounding out of 
the cockpit.

&quot;You know what?&quot; Quistis sighed happily.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Fujin responded contently.

&quot;As soon as I get my strength back you and I are coming here.&quot;

Fujin laughed.

&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot;

&quot;EXPENSIVE.&quot; Fujin gawked.

&quot;So?&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d love it, I can tell, look at you, you can hardly sit still 
already.&quot; Quistis smirked. Fujin shrugged her shoulders shyly and 
giggled. Her merriment was as much infectious as it was uncommon and 
Quistis couldn&#39;t help but join in.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen you so cheerful.&quot;

&quot;SORRY.&quot;

&quot;No, don&#39;t be sorry.&quot; Quistis smiled, leaning over towards her slowly. 
Fujin met her halfway but the moment was ruined as Rinoa screamed in 
shock. Startled and off balance Fujin fell forward, nearly toppling out 
of her seat as Quistis raised up sharply.

&quot;Quisty!&quot; Squall blurted as Zell hopped up and down laughing like a 
psychotic imp.

&quot;Hi guys.&quot; Quistis smiled brightly.

&quot;When, how!?&quot; Rinoa stammered in tear filled wonder.

&quot;Long story.&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;Oh man, she&#39;s not kidding, you wouldn&#39;t believe it.&quot; Zell explained 
exuberantly as Squall moved forward slowly.

&quot;Squall.&quot; Quistis smiled, only to be caught off guard as he leaned to 
embrace her tightly.

&quot;We thought we lost you.&quot; He whispered hoarsely, his voice thick with 
emotion. Touched but the rare show of affection, Quistis patted his back 
gently.

&quot;I&#39;m fine hon, I&#39;m back.&quot; She said soothingly.

&quot;That&#146;s beautiful man.&quot; Zell bawled unabashedly. Fujin couldn&#39;t help but 
chuckle aloud as Rinoa shoved Squall away to steal a hug of her own.

&quot;Hyne I missed you so much, I&#39;m so sorry for being a jerk, I&#39;m sorry for 
not listening. I&#39;m sorry for everything!&quot; She babbled in near hysteria 
while fighting through choking sobs.

&quot;Oh stop it you guys.&quot; Quistis blushed, wiping at her eyes. &quot;You&#39;re 
going to get me started. Letting go, Rinoa turned to Fujin with arms 
wide open.

&quot;Fuji!&quot; She shouted even as Fujin intercepted her and declined the hug 
graciously.

&quot;You can thank Fujin and Ellone.&quot; Quistis explained as Squall stared at 
the reunion with an awkward smile.

&quot;Oh let it out.&quot; Zell prodded, wiping tears from his own, swollen and 
blackened eyes. Squall tried to give him a sour look but failed 
miserably. Instead he pointed curiously.

&quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;Seifer.&quot; Zell giggled wildly, causing Squall to eye him suspiciously.

********************

After everyone had settled enough think, Squall and Zell went to stow 
the luggage while Rinoa and Quistis chatted madly back and forth while 
Fujin sat listening half heatedly. Finally with everything packed away 
the boys returned with Zell babbling about the recent drama&#39;s while 
Squall seemed back to his normal aloof self.

&quot;Have you picked Selphie and Irvine up yet?&quot; Squall asked, sitting down 
in the copilot seat. Pausing he sniffed the air.

&quot;I smell perfume?&quot;

&quot;Fujin&#39;s doing.&quot; Zell grumbled. &quot;She uh... said the cockpit smelled like 
feet.&quot;

&quot;I wonder why?&quot; Squall said derisively. &quot;I told you not to prop your 
feet on the console.&quot;

&quot;Those shoes were killing me; I needed to get the swelling down. Besides 
it&#39;s been like four weeks.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve always done that.&quot; Squall groaned as they separated from the 
resort. &quot;What was it you said? Oh yeah I remember; Something like; If I 
don&#39;t get to fly then I&#39;ll resort to chemical warfare.&quot;

&quot;Bah.&quot; Zell grumbled, bringing the ship around so it could begin its 
reentry.

Thirty minutes later, the Ragnarok found itself nearing Deling&#39;s airport 
on final approach. Fifteen minutes after that the ship had landed and 
the docking ramp lowered. Zell and Rinoa exited the craft in search of 
Irvine and Selphie. The search was easy, Selphie could be seen waddling 
towards them, wearing a floppy wide sun hat, while Irvine lumbered 
behind her carrying a monstrous amount of shopping bags, luggage and 
dragging two mobile storage racks full of odds and ends. Neither Zell 
nor Rinoa gave any indication of the surprise the two honeymooners had 
waiting.

&quot;I&#39;m going to kill him.&quot; Selphie barked as she met up with and stormed 
past Zell.

&quot;Selphie?&quot; Rinoa gawked, turning to look at her curiously.

&quot;Oh dude, what&#39;d you do?&quot; Zell grinned at Irvine.

&quot;Baby&#39;s been kicking. She blames me.&quot; Irvine shrugged devoid of will.

&quot;We&#39;ll you are the father.&quot; Rinoa grinned.

Irvine moaned it humorous dismay.

&quot;Did you have fun at least?&quot; Rinoa asked hopefully.

&quot;Oh yeah it was great.&quot; Irvine nodded.

&quot;Damn man let me help.&quot; Zell laughed as Irvine struggled with the 
mountain of baby gear.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Irvine smiled appreciatively as Rinoa and Zell took a share of 
the load. Rinoa looked curiously at stack.

&quot;Um think you have enough stuff?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t ask me, she&#39;s in charge.&quot; Irvine nodded up ahead to Selphie who 
was already making her way into the ship. Once everyone was aboard, 
Selphie turned to regard Zell irritably.

&quot;Get us out of here, I want to go home and go to bed, I feel like crap.&quot;

&quot;Um want me to help you get this stuff packed first?&quot; Zell asked, trying 
to be helpful.

&quot;No, I can do it!&quot; Selphie barked, causing him to flinch.

&quot;Okay, okay I&#39;m going he stammered.

&quot;I&#39;ll help you.&quot; Rinoa offered. Selphie accepted the offer and pointed 
to large box containing various foodstuffs.

&quot;Sort that.&quot; She nodded while Irvine sulked towards the elevator leading 
to the bridge. He wanted nothing more to be away from her when she was 
in such a mood.

&quot;Come back here.&quot; Selphie growled. &quot;Put this stuff up.&quot; She snapped, 
pushing a large box containing an unassembled crib towards him. Resigned 
to his fate did as she was told.

By the time they were done the Ragnarok was well on its way back to 
Balamb Garden. Those on the bridge could here Selphie complaining even 
before the elevator arrived. As they appeared, Fujin stood, so that she 
could avoid any rush. Irvine saw her first and looked surprised.

&quot;Oh no.&quot; He frowned. Unable to read her features he feared the worst.

&quot;What?&quot; Selphie snapped, walking forward a step before seeing her. &quot;Oh 
whoa, Fujin.&quot; She stammered; the irritation in her voice immediately 
giving way to concern. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;What, no hi for me?&quot; Quistis giggled, peeking around from behind the 
seat.

Rinoa laughed brightly, as did Zell, while Squall waited for the ensuing 
explosion with amusement.

Selphie&#39;s scream of shock and joy was both deafening and incoherent. 
Without a second thought she grabbed the person nearest to her in a 
tight hug. Fujin didn&#39;t have a chance to dodge the embrace and accepted 
it in stride; that is until Selphie&#39;s water broke and doused her feet. </pre>
