Quistis walked along the main hall of the garden deep in thought. People 
mingled around her some staring at her oddly. She had left Fujin&#146;s 
chamber a few hours before, she was feeling a bit mad. She had missed 
her class, something she never had done. She promised herself to make it 
up to them.

Aeka tackled her from out of no where.

&quot;YOUR OKAY!&quot; Quistis was completely unprepared and they both fell into 
the pool of water surrounding the walkway. Quistis came up sputtering 
and stunned. Aeka splashed and clawed at her frantically. The girl was 
smaller than Selphie and more than a little sickly. Only her 
determination and grades kept her at the garden. She apparently couldn&#146;t 
swim, Quistis noticed as the flailing girl knocked her glasses off. They 
where drawing a crowd. Quistis picked the girl up and stood, the water 
barely reach her knees. She walked to the railing and set the girl on 
her feet. Aeka looked around horrified and wanted to run away. Quistis 
climbed out of the fountain and regarded the girl. She was actually glad 
for the distraction it gave her something else to think about than her 
problems.

&quot;Well glad to see you too Aeka.&quot; She grinned as she lay a sopping hand 
atop her head.

Aeka burst in to tears.

Quistis rolled her eyes

&quot;Come on lets get you dry.&quot;

*****************************

Fujin was feeling much better, her ankle could not support her weight 
but she made do. When she woke up the storm had died out and it was 
already noon, and was getting desperately hot in the station. Using a 
broom as make shift crutch she rummaged through the dusty facility for 
supplies. She found a worn breaker box and flipped the handle. The 
building came alive with screeching music. She nearly fell in fright at 
the blaring sound. She hobbled about madly trying to find the speaker. 
She found it in the corner near the ceiling. She poked it to death with 
her broom then sat on a chair. She wondered where the supplies where 
kept she had to find food and water or she was done for. She heard the 
tortured whine of machinery below her.

&quot;BASEMENT?&quot; She stood and started looking around the floor shoving 
debris out of the way. She felt a cool breeze drifting across her neck 
causing her to shiver lightly. She glanced and saw a the vents rattling 
faintly as the air conditioning kicked in. She thanked whatever guardian 
angel decided she was worth the effort. After a little bit of poking 
around she finally found what she was looking for. A simple touch button 
panel on the wall near the back of the place. She toyed with it for a 
moment before it actually responded. The floor right beside her slid 
away slowly kicking up a cloud of dust that made her sneeze repeatedly. 
She looked into the new hole in the floor a small stairway lead down and 
into a small room.

She made her way carefully down the steps only a dim blue light shown 
her the way. To her left was a large generator that belched and shook as 
if it was angry for being awakened after so long. She moved on past the 
racket down the short, low hall. At the end was a metal door similar to 
a meat locker. She opened it without a second thought and breathed easy 
at what she saw. The walls where lined with freeze dried food packs and 
vacuum packed jerky. She was most happy however, at seeing the dozen or 
so sealed water containers on the floor. She quickly took what she 
could, along with one of the conveniently readied backpacks. She spent 
the rest of the day eating and gaining strength for her long trip later 
that evening.

*****************************

Quistis entered her apartment with a miserable Aeka. She went to the 
bathroom and returned with several towels and handed the girl one. Aeka 
took it and sniffed loudly.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry I knocked you into the water Miss Trepe.&quot; She started.

&quot;Tsk don&#146;t think nothing about it Aeka.&quot; She grinned. &quot;Why don&#146;t you 
tell me why you felt the need to tackle me to begin with?&quot;

Aeka looked on the verge of tears again. Quistis held up her hands and 
shook her head.

&quot;No No it&#146;s okay Aeka don&#146;t cry. Here hold on a moment.&quot; Quistis hopped 
up went to her room.

Quistis came back out a few minutes later wearing a house coat and 
offered Aeka one.

&quot;Here go change into this. Selphie left it during a sleep over it should 
fit you. Then you can tell me what&#146;s got you so upset.&quot;

Aeka nodded and went to the bathroom to change. Quistis meanwhile made 
her some hot tea. Aeka came out and met her in the kitchen.

&quot;Here you go hon.&quot; Quistis said with a motherly grin and gave her the 
tea.

&quot;Thanks ma&#146;am&quot;

&quot;Call me Quistis or even Quisty. Thats what my friends call me.&quot; Quistis 
gathered the girls clothes and put them in the dryer.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry again Miss Quistis err Miss Quisty.&quot; She stammered.

&quot;Nonsense. Thats enough of that. Come sit down we will talk.&quot; She led 
her to the couch and motioned her to sit while she took the chair.

&quot;Well after Ms. Edea took over for you today we all got so worried 
something happened.&quot;

&quot;Edea?&quot; Quistis screwed her face up at the thought. Edea generally had 
little to do with the students she left it Cid, Squall and Xu.

&quot;Yes, she said you was feeling bad, so she was going to teach today. The 
Luccian started a fight with Rinoa and Royce.&quot; She broke down in tears 
again.

&quot;Oh dear.&quot; Quistis frowned, she knew Luccian would be a problem 
eventually.

&quot;Go on hon, then what happened.&quot;

&quot;Then Ms. Edea did something and knocked everyone down. Luccian.. he got 
mad and yelled at her.&quot;

&quot;At Edea??&quot; As if starting something with Rinoa wouldn&#146;t get him in 
trouble with Squall. Edea would have his hide for starting with her.

&quot;Yes, She kicked him out of the Committee and he stormed out..&quot; She said 
shakinly.

&quot;I see.&quot; Quistis went and hugged the girl to calm her.

&quot;It&#146;s okay Aeka, I&#146;m fine, everything is fine.&quot; Quistis winced at the 
lie. She sat back down to think. Aeka sniffed quietly for a while before 
looking up sadly.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry you friend left Quisty.&quot; She said wiping her eyes on her 
sleeve.

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis regarded her oddly.

&quot;I mean Miss Trepe.&quot; She shrank back in her chair.

&quot;No No hon it&#146;s ok. What friend are you talking about.?&quot;

&quot;Um I dunno her name. The sad lady with the white hair.&quot; She shrugged 
absently.

&quot;Her name was Fujin.&quot; Quistis said softly.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Aeka replied, seeing the look of sadness on her mentors face. 
&quot;Will she be back?&quot;

Quistis looked down at her hands and shook her head.

&quot;Something happened?&quot; Aeka slumped in her chair sadly at the thought.

&quot;I don&#146;t know hon.&quot; Quistis whispered. She then looked up curiously and 
regarded the girl.

&quot;How did you know about her?&quot; She felt a chill.

&quot;I just notice things is all..&quot; Aeka shrugged and sipped her tea.

&quot;Things?&quot; Quistis felt something was amiss.

&quot;Well.&quot; Aeka shrank in her chair and blushed.

&quot;Its okay hon your not in trouble. I&#146;m just curious is all.&quot;

&quot;I saw her carry you here one night. I also notice how you take up for 
her whenever anyone talks about her.&quot; She looked down expecting to get 
in trouble.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Was all Quistis could manage.

&quot;You miss her don&#146;t you.&quot; Aeka regarded her with a understanding 
expression.

Quistis nodded unable to put it into words.

&quot;I&#146;m sure she misses you too where ever she is.&quot; She smiled hopefully 
and sipped her tea.

&quot;I hope so.&quot; Quistis murmured.

&quot;Where you two? Um ya know?&quot; Aeka blushed.

Quistis looked up in shock at her.

&quot;Eeep sorry ma&#146;am. Just trying to make you feel better. It&#146;s better to 
talk about what&#146;s hurting you.&quot; Aeka looked shyly. Quistis looked down 
again, she was taken off.

&quot;No&quot; She finally whispered.

&quot;I understand.&quot; Aeka frowned in dismay.

&quot;I sometimes wish we where.&quot; Quistis spoke again, softly. She was 
bewildered at herself for opening up to this girl. A student non the 
less, but she seemed genuinely worried. She supposed its true what they 
say about opening up to strangers. Aeka nodded quietly and listened.

&quot;I only wish I knew what she felt. Sometimes I thought she felt the 
same. I just don&#146;t know.&quot;

&quot;How long did you know each other?&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s the sad part I knew her most of my life but only until the night 
before she left did I really start to know her. She was so full of pain 
and loneliness but she tried to hide. Underneath it all, I know there is 
a beautiful person just wanting be free to love and to be loved.&quot;

Aeka smiled brightly and wiped her eyes.

&quot;That&#146;s beautiful.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s true.&quot;

&quot;You should try to find her. Who knows what will happen?&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t even know where to begin?&quot;

&quot;Besides what would everyone think?&quot;

&quot;Do you care?&quot; Aeka giggled.

&quot;No, not much. What do you think?&quot; Quistis looked at the girl grinning.

&quot;I think it&#146;s romantic. I wish I had someone who felt about me like you 
do about her.&quot; She giggled giddily.

&quot;Oh I think someone does.&quot; Quistis said smilingly as she sipped her tea.

&quot;Nah I&#146;m to scrawny, sickly.&quot; She made a face but smiled.

&quot;What about Royce? He&#146;s nice and handsome too.&quot; Quistis offered.

&quot;He&#146;s a doll. But he could never see me like that.&quot; She hung her head 
and shrugged.

&quot;I bet your wrong. Ask him to the SEED graduation dance. I bet he will 
go with you.&quot;

&quot;Yeah right.&quot; She giggled.

&quot;I&#146;m serious Aeka.&quot; Quistis eyed her sternly.

&quot;Your assuming I will pass. Ms. Trepe lets be honest I am hardly SEED 
material.&quot; She sighed.

&quot;Don&#146;t be like that. I am certain you will make it. You have the right 
stuff it takes more than brawn to become a SEED.&quot;

&quot;Do you really think so?&quot; Aeka looked unsure but brightened a bit.

&quot;Oh I know so. So are you going to ask him.&quot; Quistis ribbed playfully.

&quot;I am much to shy for that.&quot; She shook her head embarrassed.

&quot;Oh come now. It&#146;s not so bad.&quot;

&quot;Ha! Okay then I will make a deal with you.&quot;

&quot;Uh Oh.&quot; Quistis folded her arms and scowled faintly.

&quot;No No listen to me. Who knows it may help us both out.&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot;

&quot;I will ask him when and if I graduate. But only if you ask your friend 
to go with you.&quot; She said with a sly grin. Quistis blinked and shook her 
head.

&quot;Oh No&quot; Quistis said with much vigor.

&quot;Ah who&#146;s scared now.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m not scared. I just.&quot;

&quot;Just what? You said yourself you didn&#146;t care what others think.&quot;

&quot;But?&quot; She could not believe she was having this discussion.

&quot;No buts, you care for her right?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Quistis said weakly.

&quot;Deal then?&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t even know where she is.&quot; Quistis tried valiantly.

&quot;Then no harm will come to you then.&quot; Aeka shrugged.

&quot;Then why do it?&quot;

&quot;Cause I&#146;ll feel better if I know someone is feeling as awkward as I 
will be.

&quot;Oh gee thanks a lot.&quot; Quistis smirked.

&quot;Deal then?&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t know let me get back to you.&quot;

&quot;I think my clothes are done.&quot; Aeka nodded to the now quiet drier.

Quistis got up and checked the clothes. She held them up and smiled.

&quot;All done.&quot; She handed them to Aeka who promptly bowed politely.

&quot;Thank you Miss Trepe.&quot; She took her clothes and went to get dressed.

Quistis watched her go into the bathroom. She grinned inwardly the girl 
was nice. She had never really tried to talk to the Treppies as herself 
and not a teacher. Though the conversation was awkward she did enjoy it. 
Aeka came back out and handed Quistis the housecoat.

&quot;Thanks again and sorry again about the water thing.&quot; Aeka said with a 
blushing smile

&quot;No harm done. To be honest I am glad we had a chance to talk.&quot; Quistis 
grinned.

&quot;Me too.&quot; Aeka hugged her abruptly. Then backed off giggling brightly.

&quot;See you in class tomorrow?&quot; Quistis asked as they walked to the door.

&quot;You betcha.&quot;

&quot;Good have a good night Aeka.&quot;

&quot;You too Miss Trepe.&quot;

&quot;Quistis.&quot;

&quot;Miss Quistis.&quot;

&quot;Close enough hon.&quot;

&quot;Oh Miss Quistis?&quot; Aeka started.

&quot;Hmm?&quot;

&quot;I never told anyone what I saw. Nor will I tell them what you told me.&quot; 
She said solemnly

&quot;Thanks hon. You sleep tight.&quot;

&quot;I will, goodnight.&quot; Aeka waved cutely as she left up the hall.

Quistis shut the door then leaned against it in thought.

&quot;Where are you Fuu?&quot; She whispered..
