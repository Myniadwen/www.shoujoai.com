She slid against him, her naked skin glistening with sweat as she rode 
him slowly. Moaning softly she leaned forward, her mouth searching for 
his. She kissed him passionately as their bodies moved together 
rhythmically. He sunk his hands into the wild tangle of her hair with a 
growl. She snarled back in response, biting playfully at him. With a 
luxurious smile she slowed her movements, teasing him. He growled again 
in need, yet still, she teased him. Raising up again, she wrenched free 
from his grasp and ran her nails down his chest leaving angry red welts.

&quot;Fujin.&quot; He grunted reaching up to her. She smiled evilly from under the 
falls of her hair and grasped his wrists.

&quot;SEIFER.&quot; She growled mocking him.

&quot;Teasing me.&quot; He growled in frustration.

&quot;PERHAPS.&quot; She whispered harshly, grinding against his hips enticingly.

&quot;What do you want?&quot; He hissed.

&quot;TELL ME.&quot; She grinned, her ember gaze gleaming.

&quot;What?&quot; He pleaded.

&quot;TELL ME.&quot; She said again.

&quot;I need you.&quot; He growled.

&quot;LOVE ME?&quot; She asked teasingly.

&quot;Of course.&quot; He snarled.

&quot;GOOD.&quot; She purred in satisfaction.

The cry that issued out of Quistis upon awaking was wretched and 
pitiful, barely even audible. She sat up and shuttered violently, she 
felt as though she&#39;d be sick. Her stomach heaved and she drew the 
blankets to her as a chill hit.

&quot;OKAY?&quot; Fujin murmured sitting up sleepily. Her heart froze at the look 
on Quistis&#39;s face. She pulled Quistis to her and hugged her tightly.

&quot;WHAT&#39;S WRONG?&quot;

Quistis said nothing nor did she hug her back, she only sat limp as 
tears streaming down her cheeks. Fujin&#39;s concern grew even more and she 
turned Quistis face towards her.

&quot;Quistis?&quot; She whispered softly her face taunt with fear and worry.

&quot;Fujin.&quot; Quistis finally murmured.&quot;

Fujin nodded and smiled weakly. Quistis sighed heavily and collapsed 
against he. Fujin looked at her questioningly.

&quot;I&#39;m okay.&quot; Quistis said after a long while. &quot;A bad dream is all.&quot;

&quot;TALK ABOUT IT?&quot; Fujin smiled thoughtfully. &quot;MAY HELP.&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m okay now.&quot; Quistis sniffed and offered a small grin.

&quot;YOUR TURN.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;NOT TALKING.&quot;

&quot;You have a point. It&#39;s just a stupid dream.&quot;

&quot;WORRIED.&quot; Fujin said unconvinced.

&quot;Really, I&#39;m fine.&quot; Quistis assured her, giving her a little squeeze. 
&quot;Let&#39;s get back to sleep.&quot;

*************************

Cid stood silent, waiting and trying his best to ignore the screaming 
coming from Edea&#39;s office.

&quot;Should we do something?&quot; Squall asked growing antsy.

&quot;It&#39;s in her hands.&quot; Cid sighed.

&quot;Sounds like she&#39;s killing him.&quot; Xu muttered to no one in general as she 
paced about the hall.
&quot;I don&#39;t think this is a good idea.&quot; Squall grumbled.

&quot;Since when do you look out for him?&quot; Xu asked sarcastically.

&quot;I don&#39;t like this, I feel like we&#39;re going about this half baked.&quot;

&quot;Edea seems to think he&#39;s has important information about Ultimecia.&quot;

&quot;I think that&#146;s a crock personally. I think this is about Fujin.&quot; Squall 
scowled and stood. Xu stiffened, she already knew of Seifer&#39;s amorous 
feelings towards his former silver-hared colleague and it troubled her 
to no end.

&quot;Somehow I don&#39;t think she&#39;s gonna welcome the attention.&quot; Xu mumbled.

&quot;Children, Children this isn&#39;t a soap opera lets not start gossiping, 
that&#39;s between Seifer and Fujin alone.&quot; Cid scolded mildly.

&quot;Regardless, this can&#39;t be right.&quot; Squall huffed.

&quot;It&#39;s his decision, his risk.&quot; Cid sighed.

&quot;He&#39;s right Squall, Seifer knew the risk and if I may be so bold he 
deserves a little bit of pain.&quot; Xu said with cold-hearted bluntness.

&quot;That&#39;s uncalled for.&quot; Cid frowned.

&quot;So you say. I know people would like to think he was only a pawn, that 
Ultimecia possessed him. But gentlemen, let&#39;s face facts, we all know 
there&#39;s a strong likelihood he went along willingly.&quot;

&quot;You make a good point, but no one but Seifer knows for sure. I don&#39;t 
think even Edea is certain, we&#39;ll have to take him for face value.&quot; Cid 
said shrugging. &quot;If Squall feels he&#39;s no danger then I&#39;m not going to 
argue it&#39;s his call.&quot;

&quot;I never said that he wasn&#39;t a danger, but I think we may be rushing 
things blaming him for what may not have been entirely his fault. Sir, 
you know me and Seifer never got along, I wouldn&#39;t defend him unless I 
felt it was right.&quot; Squall said, steadfast in his convictions.

&quot;Eh if you say so, but I think he&#39;s got problems, big ones.&quot; Xu 
grumbled.

&quot;No doubt.&quot; Squall had to agree.

The screaming stopped and all was silent, deathly silent. Cid looked to 
Squall and Xu worriedly.

&quot;Oh dear.&quot; He mumbled gravely.

&quot;Damn.&quot; Xu said in surprise. &quot;You think?&quot;

Squall waved her silent as the door to Edea&#39;s office creaked open. 
Tendrils of opaque vapor streamed across the floor as if it were 
searching for a dark hole to hide in. Xu backed away warily as Edea 
stepped lightly into the hall.

&quot;Well.&quot; Squall asked emotionlessly.

&quot;He lives.&quot; Edea said simply and moved past them. &quot;I must rest.&quot;

&quot;Did it work?&quot; Cid asked rushing to her side.&quot;

&quot;That remains to be seen.&quot; Edea said, her voice weak and shaken.

&quot;Come, lets get you to bed.&quot; Cid said firmly and ushered her away.

&quot;Take Seifer back to his room, he should awaken in a few hours.&quot; Edea 
gestured to her office. Squall and Xu nodded, moving quietly, they 
entered the room. Squall looked around curiously; he&#39;d never been in her 
office before. One of Edea&#39;s functions at Balamb was to act as a 
counselor for the students. Even with her somber and dark manner, the 
woman had a way of soothing people with words just as easily as she 
could intimidate them. The room was a cozy affair with and masterfully 
crafted walls of varnished redwood.

Her desk was unassuming and behind it stood a large mahogany bookshelf 
adorned with a number of journals and classic novels. Two other pieces 
of furniture stood in the center of room, a large, comfortable looking 
high-backed chair and beside it a heavy looking leather couch. Seifer 
lay sprawled face down on the couch, his body twitching now and again as 
faint wisps of vapor wafted off him.

&quot;What did she do to him?&quot; Xu asked quietly, poking him the shoulder.

&quot;Probably better if we didn&#39;t know.&quot; Squall shrugged and knelt by 
Seifer&#39;s unconscious form.

&quot;You know, he&#39;s just going to cause trouble.&quot; Xu sighed.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Squall asked as hefted Seifer over his shoulder in a 
fireman&#39;s carry.

&quot;That Fujin nonsense, she&#39;s not going to be happy when she finds out.&quot;

&quot;Not my concern.&quot; Squall grunted, as he shifted Seifer about.

&quot;You realize it&#39;ll probably get ugly.&quot;

&quot;Fujin is the least of my problems.&quot;

&quot;You have a point.&quot; Xu admitted. &quot;It&#39;s just that, she&#39;s come so far in 
trying to fit in.&quot;

&quot;Quistis will keep her out of trouble.&quot; Squall sighed as they exited the 
office.

&quot;I guess so.&quot; Xu shrugged. &quot;Um you want help with him?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got him, go dispatch a security team back to his quarters.&quot;

&quot;You sure, what if he wakes up and gets weird?&quot;

&quot;I can handle him.&quot;

&quot;Alright, see ya later then.&quot; She smirked then headed off.

Squall rolled his eyes and stepped into the elevator. Seifer snorted in 
his sleep and commenced to snore heavily.

***************************

&quot;Class, as you know, next week will be final exams.&quot; Quistis said with a 
warm smile. The class cheered and whistled loudly, prompting her to wave 
them down. &quot;Those of you who are trying out for SEED&#39;s will be 
participating in a actual field exercise as part of your final exam. I 
don&#39;t need to tell you that whatever mission it is, will be potentially 
dangerous. This will not be a field trip, this is not for fun and the 
threats are real. The other instructors and I will not be within range 
to readily assist you if things get out of hand. I implore you to be 
certain of your commitment and to truly comprehend the extent of 
potential dangers that can exist. Now then, I will take any questions on 
the matter if you have them.&quot; She scanned the class intently, her eyes 
locking on the potential SEED candidates. Nearly half of her class was 
participating in the program this year, including, Fujin, Rinoa, Royce 
and Aeka. Royce was the first to raise his hand.

&quot;Yes Royce?&quot;

&quot;Were is the test going to take place Ma&#39;am?&quot; He asked eagerly.

&quot;We have several potential targets we are investigating. There&#39;s been an 
increase of monstrous attacks in the region surrounding Trabia Garden; 
you may be called in to participate in a sweeping mission there. There 
are also several reports of gang uprisings in Deiling City they are 
asking help with. To be honest we&#39;ve yet to settle on one that would be 
a good test of your skills. It&#39;s a careful mix to find a scenario to 
challenge you without putting you guys at unnecessary risk.&quot; She smiled.

&quot;We can take whatever you throw at us.&quot; Royce said with boisterous 
pride.

&quot;I&#39;m sure you can.&quot; Quistis chuckled. &quot;But trust me, it&#39;s best to scope 
out our options evenly.&quot;

&quot;Have you settled on who will be team leaders?&quot; Rinoa asked curiously, 
and praying it wasn&#39;t her.

&quot;Actually yes, and we will be consulting the team leaders as the mission 
plans become available.&quot;

&quot;So who&#39;s the lucky few.&quot; Aeka asked.

&quot;After careful deliberation with the other teachers, two of you will be 
joining three other students as team leaders in the this years exam. 
Each team will consist of three to four members. The two from this class 
will be Royce and Nei.&quot;

Royce&#39;s eyes nearly bugged out of his head as the class erupted into 
applause. He blinked and stammered awkwardly a moment.

&quot;Me?!&quot; He finally choked.

&quot;Yes, you and Nei both demonstrated fine leadership skills and have 
developed a good camaraderie with you&#39;re other students. You&#39;ve also 
shown initiative and the ability to overcome unexpected setbacks.&quot;

Nei stood, the tall, lovely young woman seemed somewhat nervous and 
taken aback, something Quistis wasn&#39;t used to seeing from the strong 
willed youth.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Quistis asked curiously.

&quot;Ma&#39;am, I&#39;m honored and all but I think Rinoa or Fujin would have made a 
better choice than me, I mean they both have far more experience.&quot; Nei 
said in a sheepish voice.

&quot;That&#146;s awfully modest of you, but I&#39;ve made my decision, unless of 
course you are declining?&quot; Quistis said firmly.

&quot;Um no Ma&#39;am, not at all!&quot; Nei stiffened and smiled giddily. &quot;I&#39;ll do my 
best.&quot;

Fujin sat listening with interest, she wasn&#39;t upset by the choices. 
She&#39;d only been with the class for a little while and couldn&#39;t be 
expected to know enough about each of the other students to risk trying 
to lead them. Rinoa meanwhile let out a quiet sigh of relief, after the 
near disaster with the Timber Owls she wasn&#39;t comfortable being in a 
leadership position anymore and Quistis knew it.

&quot;Okay settle down.&quot; Quistis chuckled. &quot;We still have a lot to cover 
before then. Everyone take out you&#39;re regional studies books.&quot;

******************

Selphie waited quietly outside the class waiting for all the students to 
filter out. Finally, after everyone had departed she walked in to find 
Quistis sitting at her desk poring over papers.

&quot;Hi Quisty!&quot; She shouted merrily causing Quistis to jump.

&quot;Why does everyone like doing that to me, you as bad as Fujin.&quot; Quistis 
sighed, setting her pen down irritably.

&quot;Ouch, you&#39;re cranky.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, just been a hectic few days.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay, I can relate.&quot; Selphie smiled, pulling up a chair. &quot;Where&#39;s 
your shadow at?&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;The ghoul.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t start, I thought you two had worked it out.&quot; Quistis groused.

&quot;Sorry, old habits.&quot; Selphie shirked, embarrassed.

&quot;She&#39;s irked about something, I haven&#39;t really talked to her today.&quot;

&quot;Must be Seifer.&quot;

&quot;Probably.&quot;

&quot;Think she&#39;ll go back to him, they used to be inseparable?&quot;

&quot;What can I do for you.&quot; Quistis said in a grave tone, wishing to change 
the subject.

&quot;Oh yeah. I need help, and you always give wonderful advice.&quot;

&quot;Who gave you that idea.&quot; Quistis chuckled sourly.

&quot;You do, so hush.&quot;

&quot;Okay I&#39;ll take your word for it.&quot;

&quot;So will you help?&quot;

&quot;If I can.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s about me and Irvine.&quot;

&quot;Uh oh, is this good or bad?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s good, I hope.&quot; Selphie said with a thoughtful grin. &quot;Well,&quot; She 
started nervously. &quot;I&#39;m wondering if he&#39;s planning on asking me to marry 
him. I mean, with the baby coming and all.&quot;

&quot;Whoa.&quot; Quistis blinked. &quot;So what can I do?&quot;

&quot;Should I say yes if he does?&quot; Selphie sighed.

&quot;Oh hon.&quot; Quistis sighed sadly. &quot;Only you can make that kind of 
decision.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah I know that. I mean, I love him to death, but we do have our 
problems, I just don&#39;t want to make a brash choice.&quot;
&quot;Well, couples have fights hon, it&#39;s the way things are. If you love him 
and he treats you right, then I don&#39;t see any problems. Unless of course 
either of you aren&#39;t done playing the field so to speak.&quot;

&quot;Oh heavens, you make it sound so dirty&quot; Selphie balked.

&quot;Sorry, sometimes you have to be blunt.&quot;

&quot;You should know me better than that.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d be surprised how little, people know about each other.&quot;

&quot;You have a point. I trust Irvy though, he&#39;s a louse but he&#39;s a loyal 
louse, I wouldn&#39;t trade him for the world.&quot;

&quot;Sounds like you made your decision to me.&quot; Quistis smiled warmly.

&quot;I guess have.&quot; Selphie giggled and leapt from her chair to hug her.

Quistis laughed and returned the embrace.

&quot;Now all you have to worry about is when he&#39;ll pop the question.&quot; She 
chuckled.

&quot;If he does, he&#39;s such a clown sometimes.&quot; Selphie sighed.

&quot;I have faith that he will.&quot; Quistis said assuredly.

&quot;Yeah, I do to, to be honest. Thanks Quisty.&quot;

&quot;Glad I could help.&quot;

Selphie sat back down and giggled merrily.

&quot;You&#39;re back to normal I see.&quot; Quistis said in amusement.

&quot;I suppose so, I know I&#39;ve been a bitch lately.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll stay quiet on that.&quot; Quistis mumbled.

&quot;Har, Har, Har.&quot; Selphie mocked and stuck her tongue out at her. &quot;Only 
thing that is bugging me is Seifer, ew gods I get fouled just seeing 
him.&quot;

&quot;I understand.&quot; Quistis nodded.

&quot;He&#39;s a creep, a jackass, a mongrel stuffed piece of !&quot; She started 
building up steam and Quistis had to halt her progress.

&quot;I get the point.&quot; Quistis grinned. &quot;I&#39;m not terribly fond of him either 
but Cid and Squall are cutting him slack so lets be civil.&quot;

&quot;Ugh.&quot; Selphie groaned. &quot;And here I am just now getting over Fujin.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll be okay, at least you&#39;re not beating on people again.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t tempt me. I&#39;d like nothing more.&quot;

&quot;Now, now that&#146;s no way for a mother to act.&quot; Quistis nagged playfully.

&quot;Fine, fine, your no fun.&quot; Selphie grinned at hopped up. &quot;Well I&#39;ll 
leave you alone so you can get back to work. Thanks for helping me out.&quot;

&quot;Anytime hon, see you later.&quot; Quistis smiled. She waited for her to go 
before going back to her paperwork.

It was a good couple of hours before she completed her task. Leaning 
back in her chair she sighed. She was still worried about Fujin; she 
hated being kept in the dark, especially after they&#39;d made such strides 
in their relationship. The nonsense about Seifer was troubling.

&quot;Perhaps she still loves him.&quot; Came a nagging thought, followed by the 
familiar and unwelcome feeling of self-doubt.

&quot;Surely not, we&#39;re happy together.&quot; She tried to reason.

&quot;Are you? She has been acting distant lately. Perhaps she knows he&#39;s 
come for her. Perhaps she thinks that he can make her happy, they were 
alike.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not true, Fujin is nothing like him.&quot;

&quot;Are you certain, you just said, You&#39;d be surprised how little, people 
know about each other.&quot;

&quot;What if that&#39;s true and she doesn&#146;t want to hurt me.&quot; Quistis could 
feel her heart sinking. She felt herself shaking and let out a 
shuttering sigh.

&quot;Fu.&quot; She whispered softly as she felt hot tears coming to her eyes.

*************************

Seifer awoke with a groan, his head pounded and he could hear the sound 
of Ultimecia screaming in rage at the back of his sub-consciousness. The 
noise was shrill and tinny like a mechanical bee stuffed in his brain. 
He tasted a peculiar alkaline taste in his mouth and he felt as though 
he&#39;d tongued a battery. He sat up and looked about trying to take in his 
surroundings, he immediately regretted the movement and promptly vomited 
harshly onto the floor. The world swirled about him in a blurry mess and 
he collapsed into a shaking heap.

**************

It was legion; its many sensory tendrils had now snaked throughout the 
small vents and crawlspaces that spread throughout Balamb Garden. This 
place was it&#39;s home once again, and it felt at ease. The only thing left 
was for it to continue along to the end of its evolution and bring the 
structure under its control. People had come in search of the missing 
maintenance man; it was forced to leave a simulacrum for them to find a 
fitting test for it&#39;s growing talents.

It had deposed of the clone at the bottom of a ventilation shaft hoping 
the search teams would believe he had died in a fall. It now rested far 
above one of the great engines that powered Balamb Garden. The area 
around the engines was like a furnace, but it was unaffected, it favored 
the heat. The warmth helped it growth and kept its form soft and 
malleable.

It shifted its bulk as one of its many maws yawned and stretched 
hungrily. It had been feeding off monsters in the training center but 
now its size made it hard to move about without being seen. Groaning 
loudly it sent a sea of tendrils out in search of vermin in hope to 
stave of its hunger. It gurgled with glee as it realized its time was 
drawing closer.

*******************

Shouting loudly, Aeka swung with all her might, hopping to catch Fujin 
of guard by the savagery of her attack. To her surprise it worked, Fujin 
only had time to blink in surprise as Aeka&#39;s small fist smashed into her 
face.

&quot;OH MY GOODNESS!&quot; Aeka yelped right before letting out a howl of pain as 
her hand let her know that it had grievances about the impact. Fujin&#39;s 
head snapped back sharply from the blow but she didn&#146;t stagger. Slowly 
she straightened and looked at Aeka with an annoyed scowl.

&quot;Sorry.&quot; Aeka said meekly.

A trickle of blood streamed from Fujin&#39;s nose and she sniffed lightly 
before wiping it with the back of her hand.

&quot;Oh you&#39;re angry, I&#39;m so sorry I thought you&#39;d dodge or throw me or 
something, I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d get hit, Oh gosh I feel horrible, did I 
hurt you, am I in trouble, don&#39;t hit me, you hate me now, wow I hope I 
didn&#39;t break your nose, I mean that would be bad, and this is bad 
already ya know, but I can make it up to you cause, I would hate for you 
to hate me, I mean I appreciate you training me and all!&quot; Aeka babbled 
in one long incoherent string before taking a deep breath. &quot;You can hit 
me back if ya want.&quot; Aeka squeaked and closed her eyes as she tensed for 
the blow. A long moment passed and she slowly opened an eye to find that 
Fujin was gone.

&quot;Huh!?&quot; Aeka looked about and saw Fujin sitting on the bench with a 
cloth to her nose. Padding quietly across the training mats Aeka sat 
down beside her.

&quot;You okay?&quot;

Fujin lowered the cloth then tweaked her nose lightly. Thankfully it 
wasn&#39;t broken. She looked at Aeka grimly

&quot;DISTRACTED, APOLOGY.&quot; She said with typical blandness.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m the one who should apologize.&quot; Aeka mumble rubbing her hand.

&quot;HERE.&quot; Fujin said gruffly and took the girls hand in hers. She then 
leaned down to fumble around the inside of her gym bag. Pulling out some 
gauze she wrapped the girls hand tightly.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Aeka smiled. &quot;You&#39;re not mad?&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Whew.&quot;

&quot;MY MISTAKE.&quot;

&quot;Sorry you&#39;re distracted, you want to talk about it?&quot;

&quot;NEG..NO.&quot;

&quot;Is it about that Seifer person?&quot;

&quot;OBSERVANT GIRL.&quot;

&quot;Not that it&#39;s any of my business but what is he to you? I mean, I never 
really knew him. I remember you two always being around each other, was 
he like, your brother or something?&quot;

Fujin chuckled and shook her head.

&quot;RAIJIN BROTHER.&quot;

&quot;Oh, okay, the big weird guy with the beads.&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Wow, your nothing like him.&quot;

&quot;UNDERSTATMENT.&quot; Fujin grinned thinly.

&quot;So this Seifer is like a ex boyfriend.&quot;

Fujin bristled and stood.

&quot;LEAVING NOW.&quot; She said, growing tired of the conversation.

&quot;Yikes, I take that as no.&quot; Aeka said quietly.

&quot;RESUME TRAINING TOMORROW.&quot;

&quot;Did I say something?&quot;

Fujin ignored the girl and gathered up her gym bag.

&quot;Oh come on, don&#39;t be mad. I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to bring it up.&quot;

&quot;IT&#39;S OKAY.&quot; Fujin said assured her as she started to leave.

&quot;Hold up I&#39;ll walk out with you.&quot;

&quot;FINE.&quot;

Aeka quickly pulled on her shoes and grabbed her bag.

**********************

&quot;I don&#39;t gave a crap!&quot; Seifer shouted before holding his head in pain. 
The guard looked to his partner and shrugged.

&quot;Look pal, we&#39;re just supposed to keep you out of trouble. If you want 
to go trotting about fine, but we gotta come with you.&quot;

Seifer ran a hand through his hair in aggravation.

&quot;Fine!&quot; He sneered, throwing his hands into the air. &quot;Come on, perhaps 
you can even help me.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; The first guard growled.

&quot;Do you know where Fujin&#39;s room is?&quot;

&quot;Who the hell is that?&quot; The second guard grumbled.

&quot;Oh never mind.&quot; Seifer sighed and stormed up the hall. The two guards 
shrugged at each other then followed.

&quot;Yo man, where are we going.&quot; The second guard shouted.

&quot;Shut up.&quot; Seifer sighed as they stalked up the hall.

&quot;You know, Xu told us that Edea said you&#39;d probably pass out if you 
tried to move about to soon. Don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to carry you back 
to your room like Squall did.&quot; The first guard sneered.

Seifer shivered in disgust at the thought of Squall hauling him about.

He had a lot of things to do and there was little time to waste. He 
still needed to explain to everyone about Ultimecia, but first he had to 
get something off his chest and to do that he needed to find Fujin. A 
shrill buzz echoed in his head making him stagger.

&quot;Ah look, there he goes.&quot; The second guard chuckled.

&quot;Call it quits dude, you look like you&#39;re about to hurl.&quot; The other 
guard frowned.

&quot;I&#39;m fine!&quot; Seifer growled bracing himself against the wall.

&quot;Sure you are guy.&quot; The first man chuckled.

&quot;I&#39;m going.&quot; Seifer said firmly, before storming off up the hall. He had 
no idea where to begin looking and was growing more and more aggravated.

&quot;Dude, this chick you&#39;re looking for, what&#39;s she look like?&quot; The first 
guard sighed.

&quot;White hair, pale, crimson eyes.&quot; Seifer groaned, whipping sweat off his 
brow. The second guard paused a moment then pointed.

&quot;You mean her.&quot; He said laughing as Fujin crossed an intersection at the 
end of the hall.

&quot;FUJIN!&quot; Seifer choked hoarsely, staggering up the hall like man chasing 
a mirage. Fujin had parted ways with Aeka at her apartment then picked 
up a little something for Quistis at Balamb&#39;s gift shop. Since the 
school was now mobile and went for weeks on end without seeing shore. 
Cid thought it wise to open a few shops to cater to the students&#39; 
personal needs. She smiled thoughtfully at the bag, she was feeling bad 
about the way she&#39;d been acting and meant to make it up to Quistis. She 
paused and looked about, she could have sworn someone called her name.

&quot;Fujin!&quot; Seifer called again, rounding the corner after her.

&quot;DAMN.&quot; Fujin sneered. Without even looking back she continued on.

&quot;Fujin, wait it&#39;s me, Seifer!&quot; He hurried to her and placed a firm hand 
on her shoulder.

&quot;I KNOW.&quot; She said venomously.

&quot;You&#39;ve been avoiding me.&quot; He whispered.

&quot;YOU NOTICED.&quot; She growled. Slipping away from his grip she started 
walking. Seifer&#39;s guards laughed aloud earning a scathing look from him.

&quot;Hey get lost, you&#39;ve done you&#39;re job!&quot; Seifer snarled.

&quot;Nadda guy, we&#39;re your chaperones.&quot; The first guard laughed.

&quot;Damn it.&quot; Seifer growled then noticed that Fujin had left him standing 
alone. &quot;Fujin wait!&quot; He shouted then chased after her.

&quot;I know you&#39;re mad at me.&quot; He sighed. &quot;I never meant to leave you alone 
like I did. But there were things I needed to do.&quot;

Fujin stiffened and blinked in confusion. Then, before she even realized 
it she was laughing aloud. Seifer smirked warily.

&quot;Um what&#39;s so funny.&quot;

Fujin shook her head and turned to face him curiously.

&quot;Just hear me out please. I know I&#39;ve treated you bad over the years.&quot; 
He sighed and dropped to his knees before her.

&quot;I&#39;ve changed since last you saw me. I&#39;ve come to realize some things. I 
know now that you love me. To be honest I&#39;ve always known, and yet I 
ignored you. I&#39;m sorry about that, about everything. I&#39;ve been horrible, 
I can only hope you can forgive me.&quot; He looked up at her pleadingly. &quot;I 
love you.&quot; He said softly, reaching up to her. With a smile Fujin leaned 
over to look him in eyes.

&quot;I HATE YOU.&quot; She said smoothly before shoving him onto his rear.

The two guards, who stood nearby exploded into laughter at the exchange. 
Seifer lay on his back truly baffled for a moment, then started to 
stand. Fujin turned to leave.

&quot;Smooth move guy.&quot; One of the guards laughed. Seifer scowled and gave 
him a foul look before chasing after her again.

&quot;Fujin wait, I know I deserved that but didn&#39;t you hear me? I said I 
love you. I want to be with you, I&#39;m ready now. I&#39;ve thought about you, 
only you for nearly a year now.&quot;

&quot;WASTED TIME.&quot; Fujin shrugged, she couldn&#39;t care less what Seifer felt. 
She&#39;d find his heartfelt antics funny if it weren&#39;t so pathetic.

&quot;I&#39;ve apologized, what do you want from me?&quot;

&quot;CLUELESS.&quot; Fujin sighed. &quot;GO AWAY.&quot;

&quot;Tell me what you want me to do, I&#39;ll prove my love.&quot; He pleaded. &quot;Damn 
it Fujin what&#39;s with you, at least stop and talk to me.&quot; He growled 
grabbing her by the shoulder. With a snarl she slapped his hand off her.

&quot;I HATE YOU, LEAVE!&quot; She shouted.

&quot;That&#39;s not true and you know it, you need me.&quot; He said softly.

Fujin laughed bitterly.

&quot;You&#39;re laughing again, what the hell&#39;s so damn funny.&quot;

&quot;DON&#39;T NEED YOU.&quot; She said icily.

&quot;Bullshit.&quot; He smirked.

&quot;HAVE SOMEONE.&quot; She smiled proudly.

Seifer made a sour face and stiffened in disbelief.

&quot;You&#39;re lying, you&#39;re just trying to make me jealous.&quot; He grinned.

&quot;CARE LESS WHAT THINK.&quot; She hissed.

&quot;Who?&quot; He asked skeptically.

&quot;GOODBYE.&quot; She sighed and turned to leave yet again.

&quot;You leave now and that&#146;s it.&quot; He shouted.

&quot;GET A LIFE.&quot; She shouted back as she left him standing in the hall.

&quot;Fine, I&#39;ll prove my love for you then, is that what you want?&quot; He 
shouted.

His words fell on deaf ears as Fujin vanished around a distant corner.

*********************

Even though her encounter with Seifer put her in a foul mood, Fujin was 
positively beaming by the time she opened the door to Quistis&#39;s 
apartment.

She smiled warmly as she found Quistis sitting quietly in the living 
room.

&quot;HI.&quot; She said merrily.

&quot;We should talk.&quot; Quistis sighed. Fujin&#39;s smile melted, she didn&#39;t like 
the tone of Quistis voice.

&quot;ABOUT?&quot; Fujin mumbled cautiously.

&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking, and I think I know what&#39;s wrong.&quot; Quistis said 
gently.

Fujin frowned and stood stiffly.

&quot;I love you Fu, you know that, and I always will.&quot; Quistis continued, 
looking up sadly, her eyes were puffy and it looked like she&#39;d been 
crying.

Fujin&#39;s heart tightened her chest, she definitely didn&#39;t like where this 
was going.

&quot;what are you doing?&quot; She said quietly, her voice sounding small and 
fragile.

&quot;I just want whatever makes you happy.&quot; She sighed heavily

&quot;don&#39;t.&quot; Fujin said weakly.

&quot;A part of loving someone is to know when to let them go.&quot; Quistis 
choked as she tried to fight back tears. &quot;I know you love him, so, I 
want you to know that I&#39;ll understand if you want to go to him.&quot;

Fujin was horrified and surprised, this was the last thing she was 
expecting.

Her face twisted into one of utter confusion.

&quot;WHAT!?&quot; She said dully.

&quot;You love him still, I understand.&quot; Quistis said quietly.

Fujin was more insulted by the words than hurt.

&quot;BELIVE THAT?&quot; She cried in disbelief.

&quot;But I thought.&quot; Quistis sniffed in complete misery.

&quot;NO!&quot; Fujin shouted, completely ruffled.

Quistis was shocked and a feeling of horror crept within her. Fujin 
clutched her head in anger, unable believe her ears. Quistis stood and 
moved towards her shakily.

&quot;Oh Fu, I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Quistis sobbed fearfully, reaching for her.

Wounded tears streamed down Fujin&#39;s face and she backed away from 
Quistis with a distraught gasp.

&quot;NO.&quot; She cried out.

&quot;Fu?&quot; Quistis said feebly.

&quot;HURT ME, CAN&#39;T BELIVE!&quot; Fujin shouted angrily, her voice cracking in 
sorrow. &quot;LOVE YOU, NOT SEIFER.&quot;

&quot;I only wanted.&quot; Quistis tried.

&quot;WAS WRONG!&quot; Fujin cried shakily.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Quistis sobbed sinking to her knees.

Fujin gave out a wretched cry, with tears streaming her cheeks, she 
dropped her bag and ran out the door. </pre>
