<p>Forcible Answer</p>
<p>            Quistis  awoke and sneezed. She turned over and noticed that Xu was gone. She sat up and  stretched. Xu exited the bathroom.</p>
<p>            “Hey.”  Quistis yawned sleepily.</p>
<p>            “Quistis.”  Xu said, her lower lip trembling. The blonde Instructor snapped fully awake at  the sound of her concerned voice. “I…I got up last night and…”</p>
<p>            “What? Did  something happen? Did someone sneak in?” she asked.</p>
<p>            “I was  looking for a glass and I opened one of your drawers. I…” Xu felt suddenly  foolish. She couldn’t accuse her best friend of something like this. Quistis  was stronger than that. How could she ever doubt. “Sorry, nevermind. I just had  a bad dream…when I was awake. Sort of a premonition you could say.” It was a  complete lie but Xu was making it up as she went.</p>
<p>            “What was  the dream?”</p>
<p>            “I saw you.  You had become Ultimecia…” Xu continued. “But it was just a dream. I’m sorry if  I worried you.” She forced a smile onto her face. But Quistis was every bit as  observant as ever. She didn’t believe such a lie.</p>
<p>            “Seriously  Xu, what’s wrong?” It was then that she came up with a better lie…though it was  partially true as well.</p>
<p>            “This  sleepover has gotten me thinking. We’ve grown apart recently. You’ve been off  saving the world and exploring every single corner of the world, and I’ve been  stuck at Balamb playing ‘leader’ until you guys get back. I’m afraid that our  friendship is going to disappear, Quisty.”</p>
<p>            “Xu…”  Quistis leaned over and gave her a hug. Xu returned it, squeezing so hard she  thought she might die. “Well, we’ve got all day, what do you want to do?” Xu  smirked evilly, she had something in mind alright.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>            Unfortunately,  the two were intercepted by a bouncy Selphie and an almost as excited Rinoa.</p>
<p>            “Oh  Quiiiisssttyy…” Selphie sang. Quistis’s blood ran cold and she fought the urge  to run for her life. “We’ve got a surprise for yoooooouuu…”</p>
<p>            “Er…um…”  she stammered, looking for a way to escape. Xu looked on in amusement as she  tried to get out of the situation. </p>
<p>            “This isn’t  the best time, Selph.” Quistis laughed nervously.</p>
<p>            “Don’t be  silly!” Rinoa said, a bright and almost sickening smile plastered across her  perfect features. Quistis flashed another wary grin. “Trust me, you’ll like  him…I mean it!” Selphie kicked her in the shin while Quistis groaned aloud.</p>
<p>            “You just  gave it away!” Selphie hissed. Rinoa hopped on one leg, clutching her sore spot  and muttering curses under her breath. “Um…pay her no mind…” she tried feebly,  hoping Quistis had not heard.</p>
<p>            “Selphie,”  she said exasperatedly. “I told you, no more blind dates. Especially after that  midget…” She shuddered as a man half her size attempted to walk arm in arm. The  date did not go well, seeing as how he clamored all over her in an effort to  see the movie clearly.</p>
<p>            “But  Quisty!! We really are sure about this!! Pleaassee?” She gave the instructor a  sweet look that melted into a puppy dog face. Quistis, being the softy that she  was, gave in. She hung her head and threw Xu a look of apology. Xu couldn’t  help but giggle.</p>
<p>            “Fine…just  this last one…you swear!” She pleaded.</p>
<p>            “Fine! If  you don’t like this guy, we’ll give up entirely and let you live your life out  til you become a cranky old lady that our children’ll have to visit.” Selphie  said, sticking out her tongue. Of course that was what she had said the last  time…and the time before that…and the time before that…</p>
<p>            Quistis  Trepe hated blind dates. Selphie and Rinoa had dragged her shopping for most of  the day to pick out the perfect dress and she still settled with something in  her own closet. Something simple. Blind dates were such a bother and they  always turned out to be a disaster. She dressed up but not too much. From her  past experienced, dressing up too much was a bad thing, as her date would often  not stop ogling at her. She wore a simple black dress with lace flower patterns  at the bottom and elegant white gloves. She left her hair as it was and also  wore a small necklace with a diamond at the end. As soon as she exited the  door, Xu stopped her.</p>
<p>            “Very very  nice.” Xu complimented, looking her over. She of course, had nowhere to go and  wore nothing but jeans and a t-shirt. “You’re definitely out to kill tonight.  Feeling lucky?” Quistis gave her a sarcastic smile and a semi-death glare.</p>
<p>            “Please,  this is hardly getting dressed up. It’s because you’re so used to those farm  clothes…” she teased.</p>
<p>            “Hey now,  I’m not a well paid Instructor ex-SeeD like you are. I just do paperwork and  all that. They don’t even send me out for missions.” She replied. “But in all  honesty, you do look nice.”</p>
<p>            “Thanks, I  wish I could say the same for you.” Quistis smirked and ran down the hallway  laughing, leaving Xu pouting.</p>
<p>            “I’ll get  you back for that!” she shouted after her. Quistis waved her gloved hand and  disappeared around the corner. Xu sighed and stood there, thinking. She wasn’t  lying when she said that Quistis looked nice. She looked too nice in fact. <em>Am  I attracted to Quisty?</em> She thought with a horrified look on her face. <em>No,  of course not.</em> She dismissed the thought with a laugh as she went towards the  cafeteria.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>            Her date  was late, Quistis thought sourly as she checked her watch several times. She  waited in a nice little restaurant in Balamb, called the “Flying Fish.” It was  small but the food was excellent. Whomever invited her obviously had good  taste.</p>
<p>            “Madame,  are you ready to order?” A waiter asked. She shook her head.</p>
<p>            “Just give  me a few minutes please.” She requested politely. He bowed and went to attend  another person. She sighed and looked at the menu.</p>
<p>            “Good  evening sir, may we take your coat?”</p>
<p>            “Yeah,  whatever. Look, I’m here on a reservation. Timilett set me up.” The attendant  scanned the paper.</p>
<p>            “Yes, Mr.  Henrik, sir?” Quistis whirled around, recognizing the voice and almost knocked  over her glass of wine. <em>Hyne no…</em>Seifer walked past her and sat down  across from her.</p>
<p>            “Hey there  Quisty? You’re the one on the blind date?” he asked. “Figures messenger girl  would pull something like this.”</p>
<p>            “Um…sorry,  I must be at the wrong table.” She apologized bitterly and stood up. Seifer  stood up as well.</p>
<p>            “Woah woah,  wait, Quisty.”</p>
<p>            “Don’t call  me that. I’m leaving and giving Selphie a piece of my mind.” She snapped.  Seifer grabbed her hand.</p>
<p>            “I’m not  the guy Selphie set you up with. I punched his lights out outside.” He  explained. “I’m not here for a date though if that’s what you want I’ll be glad  to enjoy your company.”</p>
<p>            “What?” She  demanded, sitting back down.</p>
<p>            “I’m here  to discuss Ultimecia.” This caught Quistis’s attention.</p>
<p>            “Aren’t you  supposed to be wandering the far plains searching for your true self?” she  asked. Seifer laughed aloud, grabbing the unwanted attention of everyone  around.</p>
<p>            “Butt out!”  he snapped and everyone turned around. “Quisty, I’m not sane.”</p>
<p>            “We knew  that,” she hissed.</p>
<p>            “No, I mean  Ultimecia has planted a bit of her memory in me. When she controlled me, and  she did,” he added seeing Quistis roll her eyes. “She controlled me but I  fought back. When she died, she left a bit of memory in me. It was horrible  when she controlled me, I knew everything about her and she knew everything  about me. It was like we could share memories. But she planted those memories  in me for one reason.”</p>
<p>            “And that  would be…?” She asked, suddenly feeling as though this was a more serious  matter than she had originally thought.</p>
<p>            “She’s coming  back, Instructor.” Seifer said, leaning in with a dark expression. “Whenever  she talked to me in my mind, she said, ‘you’re a boy, a messenger boy.’ I  didn’t understand what she meant until she died. Quisty, she put those memories  in me for a reason.” She suddenly understood what Seifer was getting at.</p>
<p>            “Wait, so  Ultimecia’s alive?” she demanded. He nodded.</p>
<p>            “She’s  alive but she doesn’t know that she’s Ultimecia yet. She and I are going to  cross paths eventually and she’ll take the memories back. Once she takes the  memories back, that’s when the future that you saw begins. I’m the messenger  boy, I give her the memories, and she rises into power.” Qusitis gasped.  “She’ll find me eventually, she’ll take her memories back and kill me. Then  she’ll begin her reign and kill all the SeeD until puberty-boy from the past  comes and kills her.”</p>
<p>            “Do you  know how much time we have?” She asked. Seifer shook his head.</p>
<p>            “Well,  she’ll have to find me while I’m alive, right? But who knows how many years  it’ll take for me to die? Besides, Ultimecia might rule this world for hundreds  of years before she is defeated.” Seifer replied. She sat back, shocked beyond  words.</p>
<p>            “She’s  coming back…what do we do?” she asked, too shocked to realize she was asking  him for suggestions. Seifer sighed and leaned gently backwards, taking the  bottle of wine and pouring a glass for himself.</p>
<p>            “Nothing.”  He replied and took a gulp. “She’s too powerful.”</p>
<p>            “What if we  kill you?” Quistis asked but she didn’t really mean it. Seifer smirked.</p>
<p>            “Trust me,  I’ve tried. This life isn’t worth living much. I’ve thrown myself off cliffs,  put a gun to my head and fired. This isn’t just Ultimecia’s memories, this is  her power too.” Quistis jumped.</p>
<p>            “YOU HAVE  HER POWER?!” She yelled. Seifer motioned for her to sit down.</p>
<p>            “Not  really. I’ve got no control over her power. But her power is protecting me  until she finds me. Basically, only Ultimecia can kill me.” He took another  gulp of the wine and looked at her through the glass.</p>
<p>            “So what do  you plan to do?” she whispered. Seifer shrugged.</p>
<p>            “I was  hoping that you people at the Balamb Garden could watch me for a while. You’ve  defeated the Sorceress once, maybe you can do it again. All I’m asking is that  you keep an eye on me. As much as I don’t like it, it’s the only thing I can do  to prevent Ultimecia from getting her power and memories.”</p>
<p>            “But she’s  going to get it eventually…”</p>
<p>            “Oh yeah,  that’s inevitable. But I don’t want to be the one responsible for it. I don’t  want any more blame put on my shoulders.” He replied. “So, you going to help me  or not?” Quistis stared at her fork.</p>
<p>            “I don’t  know…you’ll have to come with me back to Balamb. Squall can decided…you can  talk to Headmaster Cid and maybe Edea can help you…I don’t know…I’m just an  Instructor. How would I know such things?” She said.</p>
<p>            “Fine, if I  have to talk to Pubes, then so be it. Now…waiter!” he yelled, ready to order  his food.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>            Selphie and  Rinoa ate quietly in the cafeteria. They were all worried about how the date  was coming for Quistis.</p>
<p>            “You realize  that if this guy doesn’t pique Quistis’s attention, we might as well give up  forever.” Rinoa sighed.</p>
<p>            “Don’t  worry! He’s perfect! Not as perfect as Irvine of course but he’s handsome,  rich, charming and most of all, smart. Trust me, Quistis’ll like this guy.”</p>
<p>            “Someone  mention my name?” Irvine said, walking up to them with a tray in hand. Selphie  squealed and stood up, embracing him. “Woah now, someone’s happy today.” He  laughed, setting down his food and returning the embrace.</p>
<p>            “Guess  what?” Selphie said excitedly. “We set Quistis up on a blind date she’s sure to  love!” Irvine cocked an eyebrow.</p>
<p>            “Well, if  he’s anything like me, then I’m sure she’ll like him.” He replied.</p>
<p>            “That’s  what we’re afraid of.” Rinoa replied, dully. Irvine put a hand over his heart,  feigning hurt.</p>
<p>            “Lil’ lady,  that stung.”</p>
<p>            “Ah, you’re  just a load of hot air.” Zell laughed, slapping him on the back. “So, where’s  Miss Trepe?”</p>
<p>            “Off at the  ‘Flying Fish’ with her date that she’s sure to love.” Selphie said, obviously proud  of her accomplishment.</p>
<p>            “Did you  say, ‘Flying Fish?’” Zell asked.</p>
<p>            “Yeah,  why?”</p>
<p>            “Well, just  a second ago, I heard that some officials found some guy lying in the alley  way, out cold. Apparently someone knocked him out but they didn’t mug him or  anything. Just knocked him out.” He replied.</p>
<p>            “Who was  it?” Rinoa asked, concerned that it was a serious matter.</p>
<p>            “Some guy  named, Francis or Fred or something?”</p>
<p>            “Fredrik?!”  Selphie screamed.</p>
<p>            “Yeah,  that’s the guy! You heard about it too?” Selphie and Rinoa looked at each other  with wide eyes.</p>
<p>            “QUISTY!”</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>            Xu walked  up and down the hallways, clearly bored because Quisty was out on a date. She  yawned a little and relaxed on the steps before Selphie, Rinoa, Zell and Irvine  ran by her looking a little high-strung. She stood up and followed them.</p>
<p>            “Hey,  what’s the rush?” she asked.</p>
<p>            “QUISTY MAY  BE IN TROUBLE!” Selphie shouted. This got Xu’s attention like a dancing hot  pink elephant.</p>
<p>            “What?!”  she demanded. “What happened?”</p>
<p>            “We’ll  explain on the way.” Irvine replied as they ran towards Balamb.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>            Quistis  sighed as they walked outside. There was so much information that she had just  received. Ultimecia was still alive, Seifer was the carrier of her memories and  power, they had to keep Seifer safe and on top of all that, it was clearly  useless since the future was inevitable. Would she die trying to stop  Ultimecia? Probably. So many other SeeDs had died in the future they saw  before. She followed Seifer towards the pier.</p>
<p>            “You know,  this sucks.” He said. “This just plain sucks. Of all the people Ultimecia  could’ve chosen, she chose me. I want no part in this.”</p>
<p>            “Well, if  your choices are any indication, you deserved all of this. You’re the one who  succumbed easily.” Seifer sighed, letting a fine gust of mist seep out of his  mouth.</p>
<p>            “I probably  did deserve this but it doesn’t make things better. Anyway, I’d better leave  before they find the guy I pun…” Out of nowhere Xu soared through the air and  kicked Seifer in the face. Seifer flew back and into the ocean.</p>
<p>            “Quisty!  Are you all right?” she asked. Quistis looked at the sputtering Seifer and then  back at Xu.</p>
<p>            “What did  you do that for?” She demanded. Xu merely looked confused.</p>
