&quot;Luccian!&quot; Aeka stammered, backing out of the shower cautiously. She 
wasn&#39;t sure what terrified her more; the fact that he&#39;d come out of 
nowhere or that he was naked. Considering the condition of the slain 
women around her she had little doubts about what had occurred.

&quot;It&#39;s been awhile.&quot; Luccian purred stepping towards her. If she wasn&#39;t 
scared senseless and disgusted she would have admired him, he was a fine 
specimen of masculinity, truly beautiful. But one cold, hard simple fact 
remained; she despised him, and that was long before he went mad.

&quot;You look good, the uniform suits you.&quot; He said moving closer.

&quot;Go away Luccian, Squall and the others are after you. Just leave me 
alone.&quot; She shouted threateningly.

&quot;Yes, I know, they&#39;re awfully upset, you have to help me.&quot; He said 
sadly.

&quot;No way!&quot; Aeka blurted holding out one her knives.

&quot;They&#39;re going to kill me Aeka, please, you have to do something.&quot;

&quot;You.&quot; She stammered. &quot;You brought it on yourself, you went after that 
monster, you released it. You knew what could happen.&quot;

&quot;I know, it was a mistake. I thought I could control it, please Aeka, 
you have to help me.&quot; Luccian pleaded.

&quot;I can&#39;t, just leave me alone, all I want to do is go home.&quot;

&quot;I can feel it.&quot; Luccian whispered fearfully as he took another step.

&quot;Stay right there!&quot; Aeka shouted once more raising her weapon 
defensively. To her surprise he stopped.

&quot;It&#39;s inside me Aeka, twisting me, making me do things, horrible 
things.&quot; Luccian murmured darkly. &quot;If you only knew what I&#39;ve been 
through, Ultimecia killed Archie. I have no one else, you have to help 
me I&#39;m begging you, please, before it&#39;s to late.&quot; He beseeched her.

&quot;Everyone says you&#39;re dead already.&quot; Aeka said shaking her head. &quot;I 
think you&#39;re trying to trick me.&quot; She shouted in accusation and took a 
step backwards.

&quot;No, I&#39;ve been fighting it, even now it wants me.&quot; He coughed, clutching 
his chest.

Aeka shook her head defiantly.

&quot;Liar, I saw what you did to those poor women!&quot; She shouted nodding 
towards the shower.

Luccian looked over his shoulder and sighed.

&quot;Sad yes, they&#39;re all dead, it&#39;s horrible.&quot; He mumbled then looked at 
her with a depraved smile. &quot;But you my dear are very much alive.&quot; He 
gurgled grotesquely as his features began to twitch and melt. Tossing 
his head back he screamed loudly as his face elongated into a sickly 
skeletal leonine like maw. His skin sloughed off his tortured body in an 
oily stinking mess leaving behind glistening sinew and muscle.

Aeka didn&#39;t wait for him to finish the transformation. Screaming in 
horror she let fly a handful of knives. The knives seemed to slow a 
moment and crackled brightly with electricity before bursting forward at 
blinding speed. Each one hit and exploded through Luccian&#39;s broadening 
chest leaving ragged pulsing holes in their wake. With a snarl of pain 
he toppled over backward taking several lockers with him.

Part of her screamed at her to finish him off, but common sense told her 
she&#39;d only enrage the monster further. With that in mind she bolted for 
the exit, taking just enough time to cast a volley of fire spells into 
the room hoping to collapse it on him. Griever exploded out from under 
the rubble with a deafening roar. Aeka nearly wet herself in terror and 
ran as fast as her small frame could carry her. Skidding around the 
corner she stumbled into a wall just as the hallway behind her exploded 
into hail of plaster and stone. Griever clamored through the breach, 
it&#39;s wings battering the walls and ceiling, kicking up a choking cloud 
of dust and debris.

Aeka was on her feet immediately and ran as fast as she could. Not once 
did she turn around to see if Griever was following her. She didn&#39;t need 
to; she could hear it quite clearly. Rounding another corner she was 
rudely stopped as she bolted face first into solid stone. With a crunch, 
her nose shattered and she fell backwards nearly unconscious. Adrenaline 
and fear gave her the boost she needed to hop to her feet. To her dismay 
the hall, like many others had been sealed, it looked as though molten 
stone had filled the hall and then cooled forming impenetrable blockage.

&quot;NO!&quot; She screamed loudly pounding on the stone with her small fists. 
&quot;Not fair, not fair, not fair!&quot; She shrieked then grew quiet as she 
realized that Griever was not where to be seen, and that frightened her 
even more. Without warning a large ghostly hand phased through the stone 
and grabbed her by the throat. Griever&#39;s grinning maw appeared out of 
the stone and greeted her with an ear splitting roar. Aeka felt faint as 
it lifted her off the ground victoriously. The abomination pulled rest 
of its body out into the open and examined its prize eagerly.

Quickly running out of options Aeka was desperate for ideas. The 
creature began to caress her rudely with its free hand and she closed 
her eyes in an attempt to rid herself of its leering face. She tried to 
think of a way to break free, to escape, her mind was flooded with what 
she&#39;d learned from class. Surely there was something useful, if only she 
could remember.

&quot;Guardian forces have no material form of their own, that is why they 
willingly bond with mortal beings, so they may experience the world as 
we do.&quot; That&#146;s what Quistis had taught her, though that did little to 
help her situation.

&quot;So what.&quot; She thought angrily. It was easy to forget Griever was a 
Guardian Force but that knowledge did her little good.

&quot;They also need time to bond with their host, the more time they spend 
together the stronger the link grows.&quot; She knew Luccian and Griever 
could not of have been merged long. The point was mute, even though he 
was weakened she still had no power to stop him. She could feel monster 
pressing close against her now, and the smell it&#39;s desire made her want 
to vomit.

&quot;Guardian&#39;s are beings of magical energy.&quot; She remembered Quistis 
stressing the point, and how Guardians shared certain characteristics 
with traditional magic. She could feel its tongue slithering across her 
cheek, slimy and cold like a slug, she would rather die than endure what 
was to come.

&quot;Guardian&#39;s are beings of magical energy.&quot; She repeated in her mind, 
trying to remember.

&quot;Like magic.&quot; What was it? If only she could remember. Then it hit her 
like a ton of bricks. Opening her eyes with a start she found herself 
eye to eye with bestial madness. With a frightened but determined look 
she concentrated on Griever, wrapping her thoughts about it, feeling his 
energy, testing it boundaries, just as she&#39;d be taught. Pausing 
curiously, Griever gave her a puzzled look. Then, deep within its being 
it felt a firm tug, like a hand trying to draw out its very essence. 
Griever&#39;s milky white eyes grew wide in their sunken sockets and it 
roared in defiance. Aeka recalled Quistis telling her that in certain 
circumstance Guardians could be drawn out of their host like other magic 
energies. It was harder than drawing forth spells but she hoped and 
prayed Griever&#39;s link with Luccian was weak enough to give her an 
advantage. Screeching in rage as its form shivered and boiled Griever 
flung Aeka away like a discarded toy.

She slammed into the wall harshly then fell face first onto the hard 
tile floor. Her attempt to draw Griever out of Luccian was only 
partially successful. Griever howled and thrashed about wildly 
destroying everything within reach, as it&#39;s body melted into a grotesque 
mix of its assumed form and Luccian&#39;s. From the waist down it was mostly 
human though bulkier, with gray and cadaverous skin. It&#39;s wings sloughed 
off and melted into a tar like sludge. From the waist up it was hunched 
and with ribs showing clearly through rotted flesh. Out of it&#39;s chest 
sprouted Luccian&#39;s head, hanging limply with blackened sockets and a 
thick opaque liquid pouring from his mouth.

Griever&#39;s own head was now truly skeletal, with only the barest amount 
of flesh keeping it attached. It brought it&#39;s gnarled and rotting arms 
to it head and roared in pain induced madness. The insane Guardian Force 
knew it had a problem now, it&#39;s host was little more than a walking 
corpse to begin with and the girl&#39;s attempt to draw it forth destroyed 
what little life energy it had left. Its time in the mortal realm was 
nearly over and it would soon be forced back into the Umbra. Still it 
was better than being imprisoned. It knew, that in time it would be 
called forth again and it would pick up where it left off and it&#39;s 
hunger for mortal delights would not be held back. Despite the set back 
it planned to make full use of the fading energy it had remaining. With 
a snarl it growled low in its throat and took a step towards the small 
waif of a girl that had brought it ruin.

Aeka looked up weakly and smiled a bloody smile; once again Griever felt 
a tug, this time far weaker. Having no desire to take chances the 
monstrosity backed off. With a snarl it took a deep breath then opened 
it&#39;s mouth as if to roar. Oddly there was no sound but the effects where 
instantly obvious. The room began to shutter violently around them and 
Aeka only had a brief moment to realize the danger before she was buried 
under a mountain of rubble.

*****************

Edea walked quietly in the shadowy woods that surround the compound. 
Already she could feel the gathering energies of the restless spirits. 
Ever since being joined with Ultimecia she knew she&#39;d been changed 
irrevocably. Her natural sorceress talents had dimmed greatly making her 
unable to perform the flashy pyrotechnics of old, but the dark energies 
generated by her unique condition granted her gifts, dark gifts that 
whispered darker truths. She tried not to think of any of that now, 
instead she focused on her wards, the youth of Balamb Garden. She knew 
the rallying vengeful spirits Griever had created in it&#39;s mindless rage 
would only grow in power the longer their anger was allowed to fester. 
It was true that Quistis&#39;s assault weakened them greatly but a different 
kind of power would be needed to put them to rest permanently, a power 
just like theirs. She could only pray she was making the right choices.

*****************

&quot;Did you hear that?&quot; Royce asked curiously.

Fujin nodded and looked about warily.

&quot;FELT IT TOO.&quot; She said with a frown.

&quot;An explosion?&quot;

&quot;UNKNOWN.&quot;

A breeze light breeze swept over them tossing Fujin&#39;s hair about 
slightly.

&quot;Air conditioning?&quot; Royce reasoned.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin mumbled.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, give me a moment, I&#39;m nearly done.&quot; A voice crackled in 
Royce&#39;s headset.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Royce jumped, flailing his hands excitedly, accidentally smacking 
Fujin in the face. She shoved him harshly in return and looked at him as 
if he&#39;d gone mad.

&quot;WHAT!&quot; She snapped.

&quot;Your headset, put on your headset!&quot; Royce shouted eagerly.

Fujin did as he suggested and only heard a loud hiss.

&quot;DEAD.&quot; She grumbled.

&quot;I heard a voice!&quot; He argued.

&quot;Yeah I think that&#39;s got it, all the comm. links should be repaired.&quot; 
Xu&#39;s voice echoed into Fujin&#39;s ear causing her to smile brightly.

&quot;XU!&quot; She shouted eagerly.

Xu nearly fell out of her seat startled.

&quot;HOLY SHIT!&quot; She blurted into her comm., unfortunately she was 
broadcasting to everyone at the time.

&quot;Xu? You okay over there?&quot; Squall responded cautiously, giving Irvine 
and Seifer curious looks as they halted their trek.

&quot;Yeah, yeah I&#39;m fine, now shut up!&quot; Xu blurted before cutting him off.

Squall looked offended and switched off his headset.

&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; Irvine asked.

&quot;Who knows.&quot; Squall sighed.

Fujin waited calmly for a response and had to fend off Royce who was 
grabbing eagerly at her headset, since his had apparently stopped 
receiving.

&quot;Hyne Fu is that you! We thought you were dead, Quistis is going to have 
a stroke!&quot; Xu shouted.

&quot;What&#39;s she saying!&quot; Royce shouted forcing Fujin to lean close so he 
could listen. Xu overheard him and gave a sigh of relief.

&quot;Royce! Your there too what the hell happened?&quot; She asked.

&quot;It&#39;s my..&quot; He started sadly but Fujin clapped a hand over his mouth.

&quot;LONG STORY.&quot; She said dully.

&quot;Yeah I imagine, where the hell are you guys?&quot;

&quot;UNDERGROUND.&quot;

&quot;Can you find a exit?&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE, ALL SEALED.&quot;

&quot;Hold on a moment.&quot; Xu said smiling ear form ear. She switched 
frequencies and took a breath.

&quot;Quistis.&quot; She said quietly, barely able to contain herself.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Quistis answered in a somewhat robotic tone.

&quot;I need to see you for a moment.&quot;

&quot;Xu, I can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s important hon.&quot; Xu pleaded softly.

&quot;Fine, but make it fast.&quot; Quistis sighed.

It took a few moments before Quistis arrived to where Xu was. The young 
woman sat at her laptop; a small communications dish set by her side. 
She looked up at Quistis and frowned sadly, she was a mess, her hair 
tussled and soiled and her hands where stained black with ash and mud.

&quot;Here test this make sure it works.&quot; Xu mumbled handing Quistis her 
headset. Quistis removed hers and slipped the new one on without even 
asking.

&quot;Testing.&quot; She said dully, giving Xu a foul expression. Xu, to her 
credit sat stone-faced.

&quot;QUISTIS?&quot; Fujin said in surprise, she was expecting Xu to come back on 
the line. There was no reply and Fujin looked at Royce with a puzzled 
expression. Listening closely she could hear Xu calling Quistis&#39;s name 
over and over in the background.

*********************

Squall stood staring intently at yet another blocked stairwell. He 
rubbed is temples in annoyance as he tried to figure out the best plan 
of action.

&quot;We can just blow it open?&quot; Seifer shrugged.

&quot;That would take to long, and waste spells we may need later.&quot; Irvine 
sighed.

&quot;He&#39;s right.&quot; Squall grumbled and switched on his comm. &quot;Zell?&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot; The enthusiastic rebel answered, Squall could hear Selphie 
chattering in the background and looked at Irvine with a frown.

&quot;What?&quot; Irvine shrugged. Squall didn&#146;t answer and shook his head in 
defeat. &quot;Zell, do you think you can get us through several tons of rock 
without wasting magic?&quot;

&quot;No sweat, the Ragnarok should be able to claw through easily, where and 
when?&quot;

&quot;As soon as possible. We&#39;re near the heliport.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m on my way, give me a few minutes.&quot;

Squall looked at Seifer and Irvine.

&quot;I&#39;ll be glad when this is over.&quot; He said quietly.

****************

&quot;Fujin.&quot; Quistis murmured quietly into the headset. She looked pale and 
Xu was worried that she would faint again. She was glad she&#39;d made the 
choice to call her away from the others before letting her find out 
Fujin was alive.

&quot;YES?&quot; Fujin answered simply with a coy smile. Royce looked at her 
curiously and she elbowed him away in aggravation. Quistis felt weak in 
the knees but was able to hold it together. Taking a breath she composed 
herself the best she could.

&quot;How are Royce and Aeka holding up?&quot;

&quot;AEKA?&quot; Fujin frowned, she had hoped the girl had been rescued or found 
away out by now. &quot;MISSING.&quot; She sighed.

&quot;You said she got clear!&quot; Royce shouted.

&quot;SHE DID!&quot; Fujin snapped back earning a scowl from the young team 
leader.

&quot;Give me the headset.&quot; He barked.

&quot;WAIT.&quot; Fujin growled.

&quot;That&#146;s an order.&quot; Royce said firmly.

Fujin sneered slightly before slapping the headset into his hand. Royce 
slipped it on and erupted into a tirade.

&quot;Miss Trepe we gotta find her! Fujin said she got clear! For all we know 
she could be hurt and we don&#39;t even know where she is!&quot;

&quot;Okay, calm down.&quot; Quistis said smoothly. &quot;We haven&#39;t found her out here 
yet, so she&#39;s probably still down there somewhere.&quot;

Xu waved to get Quistis&#39;s attention.

&quot;Tell them to head west towards the heliport, Zell&#39;s coming to get the 
Ragnarok, to break through one of the seals.&quot; She said cheerfully.

&quot;Xu say&#39;s to make you&#39;re way west, towards the heliport. Be careful 
though Zell will be tearing through with the Ragnarok. So don&#39;t enter 
the area until it&#39;s clear.&quot;

&quot;Understood.&quot; Royce acknowledged then paused a moment before speaking 
again, this time quietly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Miss Trepe, this is all my fault. 
You should have never put me in charge.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay Royce, lets just make sure you guys get home safe and sound, 
then we&#39;ll talk.&quot; Quistis said in a soothing, relaxed tone.

&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;ll be okay.&quot; She assured him. &quot;Now let me talk to Fujin.&quot;

Royce slipped the headset off and handed it back to Fujin.

&quot;Fujin?&quot; Quistis asked.

&quot;YES?&quot; Fujin responded in a guarded tone.

Quistis could tell she was still upset with her and as much as she 
would&#39;ve loved to have a long personal talk about it, the mission took 
priority.

&quot;Griever is down there with you somewhere. I didn&#39;t tell Royce because 
it sounds like he&#39;s stressed out enough as it is. You guys get out of 
there as quietly as you can and under no circumstances do you try and 
face Griever. You got that.&quot;

&quot;UNDERSTAND.&quot; Fujin said blandly not wanting to alert Royce to anything 
amiss.

&quot;I hope we can talk later.&quot; Quistis added quietly.

&quot;PERHAPS.&quot; Fujin said quietly before signing off. &quot;HERE.&quot; She said 
gruffly handing the headset back to Royce.

&quot;What did she say?&quot; He asked curiously.

&quot;TO HURRY&quot; She said stiffly as they started the long jog through the 
halls.

*************************

Aeka cried out in pain as the weight of the rubble bore down on her.

&quot;Help.&quot; She whimpered, in hope that someone would hear her. The silence 
was deafening and the darkness was overwhelming as it smothered her in 
its stifling embrace. Struggling weakly she tried to move but to no 
avail, her legs were crushed between an immovable slab of concrete, 
oddly there was no pain. She had little time to think about it as she 
realized that she was buried alive. Erupting into a panic she began 
clawing and, tearing at her would be tomb, doing anything she could to 
try and free herself. All she succeeded in doing was gouging her hands 
brutally on the rock and scraping her back against twisted steel. The 
effort exhausted her and she collapsed as tears streamed down her cheek.

&quot;Royce.&quot; She whispered softly hoping for salvation.

*****************

Seifer was pacing like a cat in a cage. He was never a patient man and 
his thirst for vengeance only antagonized him further. Irvine on the 
other hand was relaxed, sitting coolly on nearby steps watching Squall 
chatter into his headset.

Squall suddenly turned to him with a peculiar smile and strode over.

&quot;Their alive.&quot; He said simply with a look of relief.

&quot;Huh who?&quot; Irvine blinked.

&quot;Royce, and Fujin. Aeka is missing but they&#39;re confidant that she&#39;ll be 
found.&quot;

&quot;What!&quot; Seifer shouted and cleared the distance between them with 
startling speed.

Seemingly out of no where a blinding light shone down upon them. Looking 
up they saw the Ragnarok hovering overhead; the hot wind from its 
landing engine&#39;s blew Irvine&#39;s hat from his head.

&quot;Aw hell.&quot; Irvine scowled looking mournfully as it spiraling into the 
night.

Seifer grabbed Squall by his coat harshly. &quot;Is she alright?&quot; He bellowed 
over the roar of the engine. Squall slapped his hand away and started 
moving so that the Ragnarok could land. &quot;She&#39;s fine, Quistis says she&#39;s 
meeting us here underground.&quot;

Seifer gave a triumphant hoot and socked him in the shoulder playfully. 
Squall wasn&#39;t amused in the least and shoved him away. The ship landed 
and Squall could see Zell watching them from the cockpit. Looking about 
the area thoughtfully he pointed to a likely spot. Zell gave him the 
thumbs up and within moments the Ragnarok started tearing through the 
earth, it&#39;s claws making short work of stone and concrete.

************

&quot;What the!&quot; Royce shouted as dust rained down from above. Fujin looked 
up thoughtfully from where she sat.

&quot;ZELL.&quot; She said pointing farther up the hall.

&quot;Yes, they&#39;re here!&quot; Royce shouted excitedly.

&quot;Royce!&quot; Xu called through the headset.

&quot;Go ahead.&quot; Royce smiled broadly.

&quot;The channel&#39;s are cleared but I can&#39;t get through to Aeka from here. 
Something&#39;s probably causing interference. You&#39;re closer, so you need to 
try and contact her directly. Use frequency 34.05.&quot; She explained.

&quot;I&#39;m on it!&quot; He said eagerly and switched off. After fidgeting with the 
tiny buttons on the headset a moment he slipped it back on. Fujin 
watched him with interest, and hoped for the best.

&quot;Aeka!&quot; He called out and got nothing but feedback in response. He 
frowned in dismay and toyed with it once more before trying again.

&quot;Aeka!&quot; He tried again

****************

She heard a voice in her sleep. She would have found it familiar and 
comforting if not for the fact that it was screeching in her ear. Aeka 
halfway opened her eyes, she was so tired. Perfectly understandable she 
reasoned, considering how she&#39;d spent the evening.

&quot;Aeka!&quot; A voice shouted again. This time she was positive it wasn&#39;t a 
dream and her eyes darted open.

&quot;Aeka!&quot; Royce called once more. &quot;Come on let me know you&#39;re okay.&quot;

&quot;Royce, oh, I&#39;m so glad to hear you.&quot; She cried out, she could no longer 
feel anything from the waist down and her hands were growing numb as 
well.

&quot;Thank Hyne your okay!&quot; Royce breathed out in a sigh of relief. Fujin 
smiled and nodded proudly.

&quot;TOLD YOU.&quot; She winked as another tremor shook the earth around them. 
The hallways up ahead had already caved in from the Ragnarok&#39;s digging.

&quot;I&#39;m in trouble, please help me.&quot; She whimpered softly, her voice 
cracking as she broke into tears.

Royce&#39;s expression grew grave. &quot;Aeka what&#39;s wrong?&quot; He asked worriedly. 
Fujin rose to her feet as she realized something was terribly wrong.

&quot;I ran into Luccian. Miss Trepe was right, he&#39;s Griever.&quot; The young 
woman coughed harshly, and noticed an oddly stale odor in the air.

&quot;Griever, he&#39;s down here!?&quot; Royce blurted in terror. Fujin yanked the 
headset off his head and held it to her ear.

&quot;AEKA, WHERE ARE YOU?&quot;

&quot;Fujin, I&#39;m glad you safe. Oh, you&#39;d be so proud of me, I fought him.&quot;

&quot;WHAT!&quot; Fujin shouted nearly falling backwards. Royce was incensed and 
clawed at her trying to get the headset from her.

&quot;What he did to those poor women, it was awful. I want to go home 
Fujin.&quot; Aeka said quietly in a small and frightened voice.

&quot;AEKA, WHERE ARE YOU?&quot; Fujin asked again, this time sternly, knowing the 
girl was in shock. Aeka tried hard to think but her thoughts where all 
jumbled together and she couldn&#39;t focus.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, I can&#39;t remember.&quot; Said shakily. &quot;I&#39;m buried, he 
collapsed the ceiling on me. I just want to go home.&quot; She cried.

&quot;DAMN!&quot; Fujin shouted and shoved the headset back to Royce. &quot;TALK!&quot; She 
whispered harshly.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Royce asked, growing fearful.

&quot;TALK TO HER!&quot; Fujin ordered and took a few steps up the hall to check 
the Ragnarok&#39;s progress. Royce tugged at her eagerly.

&quot;What is it! Is she okay!?&quot; He shouted.

Fujin turned and looked at him sternly, she could see the terrible fear 
in his eyes.

&quot;SHE IS IN SHOCK.&quot; Pausing, she made sure he wasn&#39;t about to freak out 
again.

&quot;SHE NEEDS YOU.&quot; She said with a sad smile.

Royce nodded quietly and put on the headset.

&quot;Aeka?&quot; He called gently.

&quot;Hi guy.&quot; She whispered brightly, thankful to hear his voice. He could 
tell how weak she was and it tore him apart.

&quot;How are you doing, I heard you&#39;ve been having fun without us? Shame on 
you.&quot; Royce said trying to sound cheerful.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She apologized shyly.

&quot;Don&#39;t be.&quot; He said, looking at Fujin with tears in his eyes. She bit 
her lip and shrugged, feeling completely helpless.

&quot;We&#39;re coming to get you, it&#39;d be easier if you could help us find you.&quot;

&quot;There was a shower and lockers.&quot; She gasped slightly, it was getting 
harder to breath and it frightened her terribly. &quot;Please, hurry.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m know, just hang on.&quot;

&quot;Royce?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;I want to ask you something.&quot; She murmured.

&quot;Anything.&quot; He answered quickly.

She giggled shyly and gathered her courage. &quot;I was wondering if you&#39;d go 
to the dance with me?&quot; She asked timidly.

&quot;Dance?&quot; He blinked trying to comprehend, that was not what was 
expecting.

&quot;Sorry, I guess this is a bad time.&quot; She apologized.

&quot;No, no, it&#39;s okay. It&#39;s just that I don&#146;t think I&#39;ll be graduating.&quot; He 
sighed.

&quot;Don&#39;t think that way, you&#39;re doing great.&quot; She assured him.

&quot;I guess.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll be a SEED I know it. Then you can take me to the dance and it&#39;ll 
be wonderful.&quot; She said dreamily.

Royce choked. Unable to speak he collapsed to his knees, sobbing 
quietly. Fujin knelt and put a comforting hand on his shoulder. Shaking 
his head pitifully he handed the headset to her. Fujin sighed and 
slipped it on.

&quot;AEKA?&quot; She asked worriedly.

&quot;Fujin? Where&#39;s Royce?&quot;

&quot;CALLED AWAY.&quot; Fujin lied, unsure as to what to say.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Aeka sighed, the disappointment in her voice clearly evident.

&quot;PROUD OF YOU.&quot; Fujin said quietly.

&quot;Why, I didn&#39;t do anything.&quot;

&quot;BRAVE.&quot;

&quot;No I&#39;m not.&quot;

&quot;FOUGHT GRIEVER.&quot;

&quot;All I did was panic and try to draw it out.&quot;

&quot;DRAW OUT?&quot;

&quot;Yeah like a spell.&quot;

&quot;CLEVER GIRL.&quot; Fujin smirked, truly impressed. Fujin had lost Pandemonia 
to Quistis in a similar fashion two years ago. It was only recently that 
the Guardian Force had been returned to her.

&quot;I think I hurt him.&quot; Aeka said thoughtfully.

&quot;DESERVED IT.&quot; Fujin chuckled softly.

A loud crash shook the area as a bright light flooded the hallway and 
the hiss of hydraulics signaled that the Rangnarok had made its 
entrance.

&quot;THEY ARE HERE.&quot; Fujin announced, running towards the opening.

&quot;Please hurry.&quot; Aeka pleaded hopefully.

&quot;PROMISE.&quot; Fujin vowed.

*************

Zell pulled the ship back from the hole and hopped up from his seat. 
Quistis and Selphie had rode with him and both were already out the door 
by time he switched off the engines. Royce was the first one to scramble 
out of the pit; Irvine met up with him and pulled him up easily. Fujin 
was next and Seifer started towards her eagerly with joy in his eyes. To 
his dismay Quistis beat him to her, and helped her up instead. Fujin 
looked deeply troubled as she squinted under the Ragnarok&#39;s bright 
floodlights. More than anything Quistis wanted to embrace her tightly 
and shower her with kisses. Like so many times before during the hellish 
night she held herself in check and settled for a tense hug.

&quot;Glad to have you back.&quot; She said with tender smile. Their eyes met for 
a moment, not long, but long enough. Seifer watched from a distance, his 
expression was cold and void of emotion. He caught their brief moment 
and understood everything with painful clarity. In and the years that 
he&#39;d known Fujin he&#39;d never seen her look at anyone with such intimacy. 
Taking a ragged breath he turned and walked quietly away unnoticed. 
Fujin looked down curiously at Quistis&#39;s torn and bloodied hands but 
remained silent.

Selphie joined them and looked Fujin over thoughtfully before folding 
her arms.

&quot;You bitch, I thought you died.&quot; She said with a playful smile, before 
slipping past them to meet up with Irvine who off in the distance 
looking for his hat. Fujin was baffled by her actions and looked at 
Quistis with a grave expression. Suddenly Zell came out of no where and 
tackled her in a friendly bear hug.

&quot;YOU MADE IT!&quot; He shouted merrily as they both fell to the ground. Fujin 
thrashed and cursed awkwardly trying to pry him loose without resorting 
to violence.

&quot;Miss Trepe!&quot; Royce yelled grabbing Quistis by the arms in a panic.

&quot;Royce, what is it?&quot; She frowned.

&quot;Aeka! We have to help her!&quot; He shouted.

&quot;Have you heard from her, where is she?&quot;

&quot;We got through to her but we&#39;re not sure where she is.&quot; He blurted then 
started back down the hole.

&quot;Hey, hey hey!&quot; Squall shouted rushing towards him and yanking him back 
the collar. &quot;You&#39;re done here, we&#39;ll go find her. Go join up with the 
others by the front gate&quot; He said firmly.

&quot;You have to let me go!&quot; Royce cried out angrily. &quot;She&#39;s hurt.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t do that. It&#39;s too dangerous with Griever down there.&quot; Squall 
frowned, not terribly happy about having to explain himself to the boy.

&quot;But I&#39;m her squad leader she&#39;s my responsibility.&quot; Royce tried but 
Squall shook his head and looked to Quistis to take care of it. Quistis 
put her hands on the boy&#39;s shoulders and smiled apologetically.

&quot;Royce, Squall is right, it&#39;s to dangerous and you&#39;re hurt. It would be 
best if you did as you were told. We&#39;ll all do our best to find her, I 
promise.&quot; Quistis assured him. Royce looked thoroughly defeated and she 
tried to comfort him with an understanding smile.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Royce, you know it&#39;s for the best.&quot; She sighed.

&quot;I know.&quot; He nodded feeling dejected before quietly making his way 
towards the gate. Quistis watched him go and frowned, knowing he&#39;d never 
be the same after this. With a sigh she turned to face Squall.

&quot;Squall I&#39;m heading down to look for Aeka. I assume your going to try 
and find Griever?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the plan.&quot; Squall said resolutely.

&quot;Oh yeah, it&#39;s time to play!&quot; Zell shouted as Fujin pulled free of him. 
Squall looked her over thoughtfully.

&quot;Fujin how are you, can you fight?&quot; He asked.

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot; She nodded briskly.

&quot;Good, you&#39;re with Quistis, find Aeka and get the hell out of here. Call 
us if you find Griever.&quot;

&quot;Let me go with them.&quot; Zell asked hopefully.

&quot;Fine, just hurry.&quot; Squall pointed before turning towards Irvine. 
&quot;Irvine, Seifer, lets go!&quot; He ordered, then paused. &quot;Where the hell is 
Seifer?&quot;

&quot;Aw shoot.&quot; Irvine frowned, looking about.

&quot;Squall.&quot; Xu called.

&quot;What?&quot; Squall snapped irritably.&quot;

&quot;Has Edea contacted you? I haven&#39;t heard from her since she arrived.&quot; Xu 
asked.

&quot;What? She&#39;s here too? Doesn&#39;t anyone listen to me anymore!&quot; He grumbled 
rubbing his temples in aggravation.

&quot;Come on they can handle this.&quot; Quistis said grabbing Zell by the arm 
and pointing towards the hole.

**********************

Seifer wandered in the darkness like a lost soul. He wasn&#39;t sure how to 
feel. Mad, hurt, rejected, joyful, jaded, or indifferent? All these 
emotions churned within him.

&quot;Should I be happy for her? She&#39;s apparently finally found someone who 
could take care of her.&quot; He thought, trying to see the brighter side of 
the situation.

&quot;That&#39;s bullshit, I hate her.&quot; He mumbled to no one in particular though 
he didn&#39;t believe it. &quot;Why should I care, it&#39;s not like she or anyone 
cares. To them I&#39;m just some bastard to be dealt with.&quot; He said aloud 
angrily.

&quot;Do you believe that.&quot; A voice called out of the darkness entrancingly.

&quot;Go away Edea, I&#39;m in no mood for your spiritual jargon, you&#39;re just 
like the others.&quot; He growled accusingly.

&quot;Foolish child. You are as dear to me as if you were my flesh and blood. 
How could I not love you.&quot; She said quietly appearing behind him. With 
caring hands she embraced him, pressing her cheek to his back. She held 
him silently for a long moment. Neither of them saying anything as the 
wind howled softly around them.

&quot;What&#39;s to become of me Matron?&quot; Seifer finally said, his voice choked 
with emotion. &quot;There&#39;s such a darkness inside of me, such hate, I don&#39;t 
know what to do.&quot; He said barely able to contain himself. Edea moved 
around to stand before him. Something about her looked unnatural to him; 
her face was paler than normal and her eyes with shrouded in shadows, 
with only the faintest pinpoints of light reflecting off them.

&quot;We all have a inner darkness child. Perhaps it&#39;s time you admit it. Do 
you remember when you told me your romantic dream?&quot; She said softly, her 
thin lips parting into a dark smile.

********************

&quot;What&#39;s her condition?&quot; Quistis asked as they made their way into the 
underground complex.

&quot;BURIED.&quot; Fujin frowned.

&quot;What!?&quot; Zell blurted.

Quistis frowned and set her headset to Aeka&#39;s frequency.

&quot;Aeka?&quot; She called hopefully. No reply was forthcoming causing her to 
look worried. Fujin didn&#39;t want to consider the possibilities and 
steadied herself.

&quot;Miss Trepe?&quot; Aeka finally responded softly, her voice barely audible.

&quot;Yes, hon it&#39;s me! How are you?&quot; Quistis smiled in relief.

&quot;I&#39;m scared Miss Trepe.&quot; The young girl cried weakly.

&quot;Honey don&#39;t be scared we&#39;re coming for you. But you have to help us 
find you.&quot;

&quot;A locker room, near some showers.&quot;

&quot;Locker room, and showers, I understand.&quot; Quistis nodded then turned to 
Zell. &quot;She&#39;s probably near the front entrance then, somewhere around the 
parking garage. What condition is that area in?&quot;

Zell frowned and shook his head grimly. &quot;Squall said all entrances were 
sealed, that entire area was melted into slag.&quot;

Quistis winced and looked to Fujin hopefully. &quot;Fujin, did you pass 
anything like that earlier?&quot; She asked urgently praying for some kind of 
good news.

&quot;NEGATIVE, HALLS BLOCKED.&quot; Fujin said depressingly.

&quot;We have to find a away and fast, she&#39;s not going to be able to hold on 
much longer. Quistis nearly shouted, feeling frantic.

&quot;We could use the Ragnarok again.&quot; Zell offered. Quistis considered the 
idea then shook her head.

&quot;No, we&#39;re not sure exactly where she is we could hurt her by accident.&quot;

&quot;Miss Trepe?&quot; Aeka interrupted softly.

&quot;Yeah hon, go ahead.&quot; Quistis said in a silky, relaxing tone.

&quot;I did it.&quot; The girl said feeling embarrassed.

&quot;Did what?&quot;

&quot;Asked Royce to the dance.&quot; She said weakly.

Quistis couldn&#39;t help but smile. &quot;I&#39;m proud of you, congratulations, 
we&#39;d better hurry then.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t forget, we made a deal.&quot; Aeka chuckled quietly only to fall into 
a series of short gasps. Quistis stiffed with fright.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t breathe.&quot; Aeka cried out fearfully between shallow gasps.

&quot;Calm down hon, you need to relax.&quot; Quistis shouted.

&quot;I&#39;m scared Quistis, please!&quot; Aeka sobbed uncontrollably, overwhelming 
panic set in and she struggled in vain to get free.

&quot;AEKA!&quot; Quistis shouted. Fujin was looking anxious and Zell bounced from 
foot to foot eager to do anything.

&quot;She&#39;s running out of air! Alright we use the Ragnarok!&quot; Quistis said 
firmly, knowing they had little time.

&quot;Hold on Aeka, we&#39;re coming hon, just hold on!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going to die.&quot; Aeka whimpered softly as she felt herself slipping 
into unconsciousness. Quistis looked up with tears in her eyes and shook 
her head helplessly. Fujin started to move towards her when the ground 
beneath her exploded sending her flying backwards. Long scabrous arms 
burst forth from the smoldering hole. Quistis only had time to shout in 
surprise before Griever shot forward. With startling speed it wrapped a 
clawed hand around her face and jerked her headfirst into the ceiling. A 
light fixture shattered from the impact and Quistis fell limply to the 
floor. Cackling gleefully Griever moved to finish her off. Zell was 
ready for it and slammed into the beast with his fists. Griever&#39;s head 
snapped back, spraying hot spit and bile. Zell moved to follow up the 
attack but found himself engulfed in sphere of inky darkness. Crackling 
with energy the sphere began to shrink and Zell could feel it sucking 
the very life out of him.

A high pitched screech filled the air and the hall began to glow with a 
bright light. Griever turned to find Fujin channeling a spell of her 
own. It moved to stop her but was to late. An aura of white-hot magical 
fury erupted around Griever. Then with a loud roar the aura imploded 
blasting the monstrosity with a deafening explosion. Zell and Griever 
both fell to the floor as the dust settled. Fujin leaped over the 
monstrosity as it began to rise and made her way to Quistis. Moving 
quickly and with great care she hoisted her over her shoulder. Zell 
struggled to his feet, cursing like a sailor and ready to fight.

Fujin had other ideas and grabbed him by the arm as she ran past.

&quot;Squall! We&#39;ve found Griever he&#39;s right on our ass!&quot; Zell he shouted 
into his headset and they ran up the hall. There was no answer, but he 
didn&#39;t have the time to think about it. Fujin knew Quistis was hurt bad 
but with Griever bearing down on them, she couldn&#39;t risk tending her 
wounds. Quickly they made their way to the opening and started climbing 
to the surface. Zell hurried help get Quistis out and laid her gently on 
the ground. She was bleeding profusely from a large gash in her head and 
was pale as a ghost.

&quot;Aw man she&#39;s hurt bad.&quot; He frowned.

&quot;I KNOW.&quot; Fujin agreed as she knelt by her.

&quot;Where the heck is everyone?&quot; Zell wondered aloud, as he realized 
everyone was gone. Once more he tried his headset.

&quot;Squall, do you read me, we&#39;ve found Griever!&quot;

A hail of static crackled in his ear before Squall&#39;s voice came over the 
line.

&quot;Zell, we&#39;ve got trouble, I can&#39;t get to you, you&#39;ve got to deal with 
him!&quot;

&quot;What happened where are you?&quot; Zell shouted.

An explosion lit up the sky on the far side of the compound and Fujin 
could see Ifrit tearing a path of fiery destruction through a sea of 
shadowy figures.

&quot;WHAT!&quot; She yelled in shock.

&quot;Aw hell!&quot; Zell shouted.

&quot;Griever sent a army of phantoms after the recruits! Do what you can, if 
you can&#39;t hold him then get out of there!&quot; Squall shouted over the din 
of battle.

Fujin had tried to ignore the commotion and focus on healing Quistis 
when Griever announced its presence with a roar. Zell spun around and 
scowled, as it pulled itself out of the pit like some horrible demon 
from the depths.

************************

This was beyond anything Squall had seen. The harder they fought the 
stronger the smoky apparitions seemed to become. Ifrit&#39;s attack had 
forced them back but did nothing to thin out their ranks. Rinoa stood at 
Squall&#39;s side seeding the air with healing spells in a valiant attempt 
to negate the spirit&#39;s dark energies. Irvine and Celest actually seemed 
to be enjoying themselves, standing back to back they laid down a rain 
of magically charged gunfire as Selphie did her best to tend the 
wounded. For their part, the squad leaders fought the hardest; it was 
their friends and teammate lives that was at stake. Royce battled on 
like he was possessed, savagely tearing through one foe after another, 
using his sharpened boomerangs like improvised blades.

&quot;If anyone has any suggestions I&#39;m all ears.&quot; Squall announced loudly as 
a phantom grabbed the end of his gun blade in hopes of tearing it from 
his hands. Pulled the trigger and blasted the foul thing in the face, 
shattering the skull that hovered atop its smoky form. He was getting 
worried, while confidant he could keep this going all night he knew the 
students where quickly loosing ground. Something had to give and soon.

***************

&quot;QUISTIS!&quot; Fujin shouted trying to rouse her. The healing spells had 
done their work but Quistis was still out cold. Griever lunged for them 
only to be intercepted by Zell who grabbed the beast by the wrists 
bringing him uncomfortably close to it&#39;s snarling and fang filled jaws. 
He ducked as Griever tried in earnest to bite his face off. Straining, 
he planted a foot into Griever&#39;s stomach and rolled backward tossing the 
monstrosity through the air.

&quot;Could use some help here Fujin!&quot; He shouted.

Griever flipped to its feet and glared hotly at him, its eyes flashed 
and Zell collapsed as he felt the bond with his Guardian forces weaken 
greatly. Griever took the opportunity to attack and pounced at him with 
outstretched talons. Fujin tackled Zell first and the two of them rolled 
clear as the Griever landed kicking up a cloud dust it&#39;s talons, 
sparking on the pavement.

&quot;This blows.&quot; Zell grunted as they rose to their feet to.

Griever roared and spun around to face them. It crouched for a moment 
before leaping at them. A loud crack sounded and Griever stopped in mid 
air as Quistis caught it by the throat with her whip. Yanking with all 
her might she caused it to flip, sending it to crashing harshly onto its 
back.

&quot;Yeah!&quot; Zell shouted eagerly and pounced feet first into Griever&#39;s chest 
as it tried to stand. What was left of Luccian&#39;s head ruptured from the 
impact and beast snarled in pain. Grabbing Zell by the arm it flung him 
at Quistis, knocking them both to the ground. Fujin used the distraction 
to leap atop its back as it regained its footing. Quickly locking her 
legs around its neck she griped its skull and twisted viciously. A 
sickening snap echoed and all eyes locked on Griever as its head was 
wrenched around in a macabre fashion. Fujin smiled in satisfaction as 
abomination stumbled and fell to one knee, steam rising from its gaping 
jaws. With an unexpected burst of energy it brought both hands up, 
slamming them together on either side of Fujin&#39;s head dropping her 
instantly.

&quot;Fujin!&quot; Quistis screamed as she hit the ground, already running to her 
aid.

&quot;Quistis wait!&quot; Zell yelled chasing after her. Griever was prepared and 
swept an outstretched arm at them, sending out a screaming wave of 
unholy energy. The wave washed over them causing both to collapse, 
drained and weakened. Griever gurgled grotesquely and crouched low. 
Immediately the area began to grow darker as the monster began to gather 
energy.

********************

Things were going poorly, Irvine and Celest had run out of ammo and 
resorted to bashing the phantoms with the butts of their weapons with 
little effect. Something was going on near the Ragnarok but no one 
present was able to offer any kind of aid. Squall frowned, he&#39;d retreat 
if he could but there were to many people down and he&#39;d be damned if 
he&#39;d leave any of them. Rinoa had zoned out a long ago and was casting 
spell after spell into the horde in rapid succession. He didn&#39;t even try 
to understand where she was getting the energy from and assumed it had 
something to do with her growing sorceress powers.

A low hum filled the battlefield and the undead masses stopped their 
attack.

&quot;What the.&quot; Celest paused in mid swing.

One by one the phantoms began to rise into the air and fly towards a 
ball of energy centered near the Ragnarok.

&quot;That can&#39;t be good.&quot; Selphie frowned.

&quot;It is time.&quot; Edea said darkly appearing out of no where behind Squall.

Squall nearly swung at her she startled him so bad.

&quot;Hyne!&quot; He coughed, wiping his mouth on his sleeve, completely unnerved.

&quot;My apologizes child for not arriving sooner but I had to wait for the 
proper time.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Irvine asked curiously.

&quot;Griever is dying, soon it will be sent back into the Umbra. It is 
trying to absorb the lost souls of the facility to fuel one last attack 
upon us all.&quot;

&quot;That worries me.&quot; Squall frowned.

&quot;It should.&quot; She sighed.

&quot;What can we do?&quot; Selphie asked, panting heavily.

&quot;I must set the souls free before Griever can absorb them.&quot; She answered 
calmly.

&quot;Matron.&quot; Irvine asked sourly.

&quot;Yes.&quot; She said, closing her eyes.

&quot;Why did you wait until now!&quot; He shouted.

&quot;Calm yourself Kinneas, things must be done at the proper time. The 
spells needed takes time to prepare, had I attempted this earlier, 
Griever would have intercepted me. I have not the power to confront him 
directly, so it was better to act while its attention was focused 
elsewhere.&quot;

&quot;How did you know to come here. Did you knew this was going to happen?&quot; 
Squall scowled, beginning to have some doubts.

&quot;Not fully, but I had my suspicions, worry not, all is going as 
planned.&quot;

&quot;Planned!&quot; Irvine shouted angrily. &quot;These kids are hurt, half of them 
could die before the night is over with!&quot;

&quot;I am aware of the trials you all have faced. You have a right to be 
upset, but know this, if Griever is allowed to escape, the ensuing chaos 
will cause even greater suffering.&quot; Edea explained as she began to 
slowly gesture.

&quot;What do you mean escape, you said it&#39;s dying, how could it go 
anywhere?&quot; Rinoa shouted. &quot;I can feel its energy slipping away.&quot;

&quot;Then it will escape into the Umbra. If that happens, what will stop it 
from being called forth again? We all know Griever is destined to fall 
Ultimecia&#39;s hands, that is unavoidable, however we can stop from being 
released again in our time.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Squall said firmly grabbing her by the 
arm.

&quot;Unhand me, this is being done for all of you.&quot; She snapped, tired of 
being second guessed. With that she folded her arms over her chest and 
closed her eyes. Squall and the others were thrown backwards as a dark 
beam of bluish energy shot out of her and pierced the night sky like a 
lance.

*******************

Quistis groaned and tried in vain to stand. Zell was in worse shape and 
lay unmoving several feet away. Griever stood and laughed, it was a vile 
bubbling sound.

&quot;All is denied to you!&quot; It spoke in her mind mockingly. &quot;Behold, 
teacher, all that I have wrought.&quot;

&quot;Luccian.&quot; Quistis murmured weakly, recognizing the voice.

&quot;That word has no more meaning for I am finally one with that, which has 
no name.&quot;

&quot;You did all this willingly.&quot; she whispered.

&quot;Of course, now all things can be mine. I only have to take them in my 
hand and it will it to be so.&quot;

&quot;What you&#39;ve done.&quot; Quistis shook her head in disappointment. &quot;You 
killed so many people, how could you?&quot;

&quot;True, it was hard at first, Arch was my friend. But my mistress, she 
guided me, comforted me, and kept me safe. Now we wait until the day she 
returns for us.&quot;

Griever&#39;s neck crunched sickly as it straightened itself out. A score of 
screaming, tortured souls began appear and swirl around Griever&#39;s 
quickly decaying body.

&quot;But before I go I want to personally thank you all.&quot; It said aloud, 
black blood pouring from its mouth. Quistis could feel a horrible power 
building in Griever and she looked to Fujin who lay motionless nearby.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She whispered softly wishing she could hold her one last 
time.

Then, like someone turning off a light switch, the swirling mass of 
tortured vortex of spirits began dissipate. One by one the faces within 
the cloud howled and vanished into white motes of light that rose into 
the heavens to vanish.

Griever roared in outrage, and looked about feverishly for the culprit. 
In the distance he saw the blue glow of Edea&#39;s spell and snarled 
furiously. Its body was failing fast and it had no time to reach her. 
However, it reconciled itself with the knowledge that it would have some 
measure of vengeance. Looking down at Quistis it let out a low, guttural 
growl. It pointed at her and its hand began to glow with hellish energy.

&quot;Die!&quot; Luccian hissed from somewhere deep inside Griever&#39;s being.

A talon, huge, metallic and unstoppable slammed through Griever crushing 
him to the ground with such force the very earth cracked underneath. 
Roaring in triumphant the Ragnarok pressed its weight down on the 
screaming monstrosity silencing it.</pre>
