Fujin had tried all night to find someone to take her across the eastern 
tracks. She was more than perturbed when she learned no one hardly ever 
went that way. She had no desire to wait around, so she stocked up on 
supplies and set off on foot. She learned earlier that it would take her 
about three days at best to reach mainland on foot.

It was noon now, she had been jogging all morning. and the heat was 
killing her. She grew faint and a bit delirious. She could easily see 
herself jumping off the tracks into the ocean below in a mad fit.. She 
saw signs that mentioned a wayfarer station a few miles up ahead, so she 
toughed it out. By time she arrived she was sunburned badly and was 
extremely nauseous despite her use of several curga spells she had 
stored just in case. She hated hot weather with a passion, it was the 
one weakness she could not overcome.

But late afternoon she arrived the station, it had not seen a human hand 
in years by the look of it. The sign over the door was faded away and 
the windows all had their storm shutters drawn and bolted tight. She 
finally staggered weakly up to the door only to find it welded shut. She 
screamed in outrage and kicked it hard as she could, to her credit she 
managed to dent it. She sat down on nearby dry rotten bench with a heavy 
sigh. Then she saw it.

The body had been here gods knows how long it was little more than white 
bones now. Most of the clothing had disintegrated with the combined 
efforts of the ocean air and blistering heat. Beside the body was a 
plastic fuel container that was as bleached and gray as the bones. She 
noticed the corpse was sprawled along the steps as if it he sat down and 
waited to die. Looking around she saw a fuel car set off the tracks 
against far side of the building . Upon closer inspection she found that 
the pumps on the car had heavy gauge locks on it.

&quot;POOR BASTARD.&quot; She said aloud looking back at the body.

She heard the call of seagulls and looked up. They circled overhead like 
waiting vultures some even sat nearby watching her. The very thought of 
it made her shiver.

&quot;BE DAMNED&quot; She shouted in defiance at them chasing them into the air. 
She was losing it, her temper was growing. This was a mistake and she 
knew it. Then it occurred to her, why he would have had a fuel 
container? He must have vehicle of some sort nearby and ran out of gas. 
She ran over to the corpse and inspected it closer. Not finding anything 
she regarded the mocking grin of the skull glaring at her.

&quot;LOOKING AT?&quot; She slapped it off the steps in anger. She ran her fingers 
through the soggy mop of her hair worriedly. She did not know if she 
could last another day like this one. Having underestimated the power 
the sun held over her. She felt the tingle of panic in her heart.

&quot;Quistis.&quot; She thought, the very name calmed her greatly and she let out 
a ragged sigh.

Something metal caught the rays of the setting sun. Something had fallen 
between the planks of the steps.

&quot;KEYS.&quot; She yelled in triumph as she kicked the corpse aside. She 
squeezed her fingers between the boards cutting her fingers deeply on 
the gnarled wood. She braced her legs and pulled with all her might. The 
plank all but crumbled in her hands as she yanked sending her flying 
backwards unexpectedly. She backpedaled to get her balance only to step 
the skull who grinned up at her maliciously. Her ankle twisted painfully 
and she heard a dull pop, followed by white hot pain. Her reflexes 
dulled by the heat failed to save her in time. She fell hard, her head 
hitting the walkway with a definitive thump. She saw the skull spinning 
merrily upside down as she blacked out. She barely realized the irony of 
the matter when it came to rest looking right at her.

 

**************************************

Quistis stood in the hall arguing with Cid and Squall. She was in no 
mood for any of this right now.

&quot;Yes I hit him! He raised his fist at me.&quot; She said sternly.

&quot;Quistis, you can not strike students like that it&#146;s just wrong.&quot; Cid 
tried bleakly.

&quot;He hit Fujin and he&#146;s on the disciplinary committee how right it that.&quot; 
She snapped.

&quot;That whole situation is hearsay, we have no doubt about the altercation 
in the gymnasium. The other students said he defend himself from her.&quot;

&quot;Only after he provoked her. You know how he is Cid.&quot;

&quot;Yes and I know how she is. She was always a problem student Quistis you 
know that.&quot;

&quot;She&#146;s not even here to defend herself.&quot; She shouted, Cid looked hurt, 
she had never yelled at him before. He adjusted his glasses and folded 
his arms in discomfort.

&quot;Quistis calm down.&quot; Squall snapped thinly.

&quot;Don&#146;t tell me to calm down.&quot; Quistis said pointing at him. &quot;Why aren&#146;t 
you backing me on this.&quot;

&quot;Because I don&#146;t have proof.&quot; He responded simply.

&quot;So she&#146;s guilty till proven innocent. How draconian of all of you.&quot;

&quot;Quistis. Please the girls not even here anymore just let it go.&quot; Cid 
said as fatherly as he could.

&quot;Screw you! You just don&#146;t want to waste time on justice.&quot; She screamed, 
Cid staggered back in shock.

&quot;God damned it Quistis that&#146;s enough.&quot; Squall yelled.

&quot;To hell with you too Squall. Your just as bad as he is.&quot; She turned in 
a fury and stormed off.

Edea walked into the office as soon as Quistis left.

&quot;I heard everything, I will go talk to her.&quot; She said quietly. Cid and 
Squall stood in shock looking at each other.

Quistis stood in the elevator positively steaming.

&quot;How dare they.&quot; She was nearly in tears.

&quot;Quistis.&quot; She jumped in fright as she heard Edea&#146;s . She jumped again 
when she realized the ghostly woman stood demurely beside her.

&quot;We need to talk child.&quot; Edea said simply as she touched and panel on 
the elevator number pad, it slid to revel a key slot. She waved a hand 
it clicked audibly.

&quot;What are you? How?&quot; Quistis babbled nearly terrified.

&quot;We are just going someplace you&#146;ll feel more comfortable. Then we can 
talk.&quot; The elevator went past the lobby level, and descend to the sub 
basement.

&quot;Why are we going down here?&quot; Quistis could envision the woman taking 
her down into the depths of the garden and killing her for yelling at 
her husband.

&quot;Yes, Poor Cid you nearly had him in tears.&quot;

&quot;Your reading my mind!?&quot; Quistis said shocked and feeling more than 
violated, she was growing angry.

&quot;No need to get angry child, here lately you are all but screaming you 
emotions. It&#146;s hard to filter them out&quot;

&quot;I thought you lost you magic&#146;s.&quot; Quistis said suspiciously.

&quot;I retain a measure of my past power to be certain.&quot;

&quot;I bet you do.&quot; Quistis said cattily.

&quot;Tsk clam yourself child. You know I would never hurt any of my children 
especially you.&quot;

&quot;Why me.&quot; Quistis said folding her arms in disbelief.

&quot;You are one of my oldest children.&quot; Edea smiled her hauntingly dark 
smile.

&quot;So? What that have to do with anything.&quot;

&quot;Well to be honest my dear you where most well behaved of all the 
children. The others even Ellone had a tendency to get into all sort of 
trouble.&quot;

&quot;Is that a fact.&quot; Quistis grinned slightly.

&quot;Oh yeas I remember the biggest fights would break out between Squall, 
Seifer and little Zellmondo. You where always to the one to help break 
it up. You also help me with the chores and my errands. Such a good girl 
you where&quot;

&quot;Zellmondo???&quot;

&quot;Yes little Zell.&quot; Edea said simply. Quistis died laughing. Edea let her 
enjoy her merriment and waited calmly for her to quite down.

The elevator stopped and the door opened.

&quot;After you.&quot; Edea said still standing in the elevator.

A cool blue light washed over her as Quistis stepped into the chamber.

&quot;Where.? This is, was Norg&#146;s chamber.&quot; She said looking incredulously at 
Edea

&quot;I know what you are planning Quistis.&quot; Edea said with barely a whisper.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Quistis replied softly, knowing Edea knew what she 
had been planning.

&quot;Do not play games daughter. You know what I mean.&quot; Edea said softly as 
the light in the elevator grew dim. Shadows played across the older 
woman&#146;s face shrouding her eyes.

&quot;What do you want?&quot; Quistis felt herself trembling.

&quot;Stop being selfish and think about what would happen to everyone you 
claim to care for.&quot; She had all but vanished now in the inky blackness, 
only her pale hands where visible.

&quot;Oh matron it&#146;s just so hard.&quot; Quistis whimpered softly biting her lip.
&quot;I know child, I know. Love always is.&quot; The darkness said breezily

&quot;Love..&quot; Quistis murmured.

&quot;She needs you.&quot; the whisper sang to her dreamily

&quot;Needs me?&quot; Quistis&#146;s heart sank weakly.

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;What can I do? I have nothing, I am nothing.&quot;

&quot;Just be there...&quot;

Quistis knew she was alone and she held herself terrified. She looked 
about shakily. The only sound was he breathing and the hum of the 
engines. Dim blue light filtered along her face as she moved about. She 
saw a bed nestled in the center of the room amid a series of silken 
sheets. They fluttered from the ceiling like spider webs in the cool 
breeze. She approached the bed with it&#146;s comfortably large pillows and 
soft black satin sheets. She looked at the night stand and saw a couple 
of photographs in silver frames. One was of Seifer and Raijin 
horse-playing in a tangle of fishing poles.

&quot;Fujin.&quot; She whispered. &quot;So this is where you have been hiding.&quot; She 
smiled softly then noticed the other picture was of herself.

&quot;What the?&quot; She whispered picking up the small frame. She recognized it 
from her apartment it was one of her in front of her desk, she recalled 
when the Treppies took it.

&quot;You stole this.&quot; She grinned faintly. &quot;You little minx.&quot;

She yawned cutely and laid on the bed with smile. The satin welcomed her 
with it cool embrace. She felt safe here, all here worries driven back 
in the depths of her mind. She could hear the beast roaring in anger 
somewhere far away as she let herself drift to blissful sleep.

 

***********************************************

Fujin lay still as death in the inky darkness. The only light coming 
from the slender crescent of the moon that peeked through the roiling 
clouds. The skull near her teetered back and forth teasingly as the wind 
picked up. A raindrop plinked atop her head not getting the slightest 
reaction. The sky lit up brightly then exploded with a monstrous 
thunderclap. She flinched at the sound, then stirred, slowly clutching 
at the dirt with her blood caked fingers. She cried out pitifully as she 
tried to move, her skin was dry and a angry red. She felt it cracking 
with each breath, driving her mad with pain. She opened her only eye to 
realize she could barely see her vision blurred from blood and dirt that 
had encrusted the side of her face. She blinked weakly trying to clear 
it.

Her throat burned with thirst and she forced herself to sit up only to 
cry out in agony as her ankle announced to her that is was broken. She 
collapsed weakly on her side as the rain began to fall. She looked to 
her bag and saw that the seagulls had torn it asunder. What was left of 
her gear was quickly being blown about by the rising wind. She buried 
her head in her arms in a useless attempt to keep warm, shivering feebly 
as the rain soaked her. The ocean waves rose and crashed into the tracks 
spraying her with briny mist, the salt water only aggravating her 
wounds. She choked and convulsed in pain. Then for the first time since 
she could remember. she cried. </pre>
