&quot;Quistis! Xu, Report.&quot; Squall shouted into his headset. His team had 
just made their way into the basement of Artemis Czar&#39;s sprawling abode.

Zell stood on his toes and pressed his face to a high window.

&quot;Oh crap man that looks bad!&quot;

Irvine, being taller was able to see clearly.

&quot;He&#39;s right boss, one of the building just blew itself into a crater. 
Any luck getting Quistis on the horn?&quot;

&quot;Damn it, no. Xu cut me off.&quot; Squall frowned.

&quot;What do we do? Subterfuge isn&#39;t an option, everyone within miles knows 
we&#39;re here now. Do we go help?&quot; Irvine asked.

&quot;No, the mission goes on. Irvine&#39;s right there&#39;s no point sneaking about 
now. Lets hurry upstairs, before it hits the fan.&quot; Squall shouted, 
running towards the stairs.

&quot;Dude what about the students, Rinoa? Aren&#39;t you worried man?&quot; Zell 
shouted.

&quot;Quistis can handle it.&quot; Squall snapped irritably. Of course he was 
worried, about all of them. However the fact remained, there was a job 
to do first.

&quot;Be safe.&quot; He murmured quietly as they made their way deeper into the 
house.

************************

&quot;Quistis!&quot; Xu shouted tugging on her arm. &quot;Come on girl we have to get 
clear until we put the fire out.&quot;

&quot;Fujin.&quot; Quistis said softly, it was all she could manage. Her shock was 
so complete that it felt as though it would strike her dead. It took all 
her willpower not to give into her emotions, to curl up and loose 
herself to anguish.

&quot;I know hon, come on. It&#39;ll be okay.&quot; Xu tried to assure her.

Quistis still couldn&#39;t hear her but followed, still clutching Fujin&#39;s 
ruined weapon.

&quot;Royce? Fujin, Aeka, can you hear me?&quot; Xu called into her headset. She 
wasn&#39;t honestly expecting a reply but she had to at least try.

&quot;We&#39;ve got incoming!&quot; Celest shouted pointing to a swarm of cloudy 
figures rising from the ground. Leveling her rifle, she channeled burst 
of magic into it and fired. The shot blasted through the ghostly 
creature&#39;s head but it kept coming. The other students promptly went on 
the offensive. All out warfare soon erupted as spells and weapons 
clashed with the ghostly forces. Suddenly the surrounding fires began to 
dim and the undead masses gained a noticeable boost in morale.

Xu, was not a fighter in any real sense, her only weapons was a small 
handgun and the uncanny ability to dodge out of the way. She focused 
more on trying to get a handle on what they where facing. Quistis looked 
up slowly, it took her only moments to gather her resolve. Now was not 
the time to loose control. With a calculating move she made one slashing 
strike with her serrated whip, easily slicing one of the creatures in 
half. She groaned and put the weapon away as the two halves sprouted 
into two identical creatures. Looking around she noticed various 
students facing a similar problem.

&quot;Xu get clear, I need you back at the Ragnarok, get our communications 
back up with Balamb. Tell them what happened.&quot; She ordered.

&quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding. No way I&#39;m leaving you like this.&quot; Xy 
protested.

Quistis shook her head.

&quot;I can&#39;t hear you! Just get out of here.&quot; She shouted. Rinoa ran up to 
them looking worried.

&quot;Guys what do we do, this could get ugly?&quot; She shouted over the noise. 
Quistis grabbed her by the arm and pointed to Xu.

&quot;Rinoa, I&#39;m glad you&#146;re here. Get Xu safely back to the Ragnarok.&quot;

&quot;Damn you!&quot; Xu shouted regretfully.

&quot;Just go.&quot; Quistis pleaded, though she didn&#39;t hear Xu she could tell how 
upset she was.

&quot;I&#39;ll take care of it.&quot; Rinoa sighed sadly as she ushered Xu along.

&quot;Celest! Come here!&quot; Quistis shouted. A phantom abruptly shot out of the 
ground and lunged for her. Backpedaling Quistis raised her hand and cast 
a spell at the creature. A glowing white aura of energy appeared around 
the creature. It moaned loudly before exploding into white sparks. 
Celest jogged over to Quistis&#39;s side, she had slung her rifle having 
resorted to her meager reserve of spells.

&quot;I&#39;m deaf, I need you to be my ears.&quot; Quistis said grimly, dusting 
herself off.

&quot;We need to gather everyone to me, I have to end this now so we can 
regroup.&quot;

Celest was about to protest seeing as everyone had their hands full just 
trying to keep the creatures at bay.

&quot;Damn it just do it, I have to focus.&quot; Quistis shouted angrily.

Celest winced but didn&#39;t take it personally, Quistis looked absolutely 
haggard and stress was showing clearly on her face.

&quot;Everyone this is Celest, I need all teams to center on my position 
immediately!&quot; Celest called into her headset.

*********

&quot;What happened!&quot; Seifer roared grabbing Nida by the shoulders and 
shaking him violently. Seifer&#39;s guards tried in vain to break them apart 
but Seifer&#39;s strength was undeniable.

&quot;Let me go you lunatic! I don&#39;t know, what happened I lost contact with 
them!&quot; Nida shouted.

&quot;We&#39;ve got to do something.&quot; Selphie said frimly.

&quot;There is trouble.&quot; Edea said breezily walking onto the bridge.

&quot;Matron! You have to let me go help. I know what Griever is capable of!&quot; 
Seifer shouted letting Nida go.

&quot;Why should we trust you, you could very well be trying to team up with 
it.&quot; Selphie said accusingly.

&quot;I&#39;m getting a visual from the Ragnarok!&quot; Nida shouted. &quot;Oh Hyne.&quot; He 
groaned fearfully. The scene was best described as nightmarish; there 
had obviously been an explosion. People where running about wildly in 
the moonlight, bizarre figures drifting after them. It was hard to see 
exactly from where the Ragnarok stood but it was clear enough to tell 
things had gone terribly wrong.

&quot;Matron please, you got to let me go.&quot;

&quot;It is not my decision to make child.&quot; Edea said mournfully.

&quot;Well who&#39;s decision is it then damn it!&quot; Seifer shouted in 
exasperation.

&quot;Since contact is broken with the others that would leave it Nida&#39;s 
choice.&quot; Edea said simply.

&quot;What!?&quot; Seifer gawked.

&quot;Yup Nida, since only we&#39;re the only two senior SEED&#39;s here and I&#39;ve 
been pulled off active duty, that leaves him in charge.&quot; Selphie 
explained, in a somewhat bitter tone.

&quot;Balamb, this is Xu over!&quot; Called Xu, her signal was barely audible.

&quot;Thank goodness you&#39;re alright! What happened is everyone okay?&quot; Nida 
blurted.

&quot;One of the munitions buildings exploded and we&#39;re under attack by enemy 
forces. These are different from the ones earlier; they&#39;re immune to 
most forms of attack. Also, I&#39;m afraid we lost Fujin, Aeka and Royce.&quot;

Nicole cried out and staggering back in shock.

&quot;Aw no.&quot; Selphie murmured and sat down heavily.

Seifer&#39;s expression quivered and his hands clenched so tight that his 
nails dug into his palm.

&quot;Understood, how&#39;s you&#39;re position. What is Squall&#39;s and his team&#39;s 
status.&quot; Nida said asked quietly.

&quot;They&#39;re okay, they are presumed to be continuing the mission objective. 
Quistis has taken control of the battlefield, I believe she can handle 
it.&quot;

&quot;Tell her to send the Ragnarok, I&#39;m going to them.&quot; Edea said calmly.

Nida nodded.

&quot;Xu, we need to you send the Ragnarok. Edea is going to meet up with 
you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll see what I can do.&quot; Xu replied.

&quot;Right, be careful.&quot; Nida sighed. Shaking his head he looked down sadly. 
&quot;This is bad.&quot;

Seifer turned and sat down quietly on floor near Selphie.

&quot;You&#39;re bleeding.&quot; Selphie said hollowly.

Seifer looked at the blood running down his hand and sighed.

********************************

&quot;Rinoa.&quot; Xu said.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Rinoa answered in a solemn tone.

&quot;Can you fly the Ragnarok?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Can you fly the Ragnarok?&quot;

&quot;A little, Zell and Squall gave me a few lessons.&quot;

&quot;Take it back to Balamb and pick up Edea, she&#39;s coming here.&quot;

&quot;But I barely know what I&#39;m doing. You can&#39;t expect me to fly it with it 
busted up like that.&quot; Rinoa complained.

&quot;Are you going to do it or not?&quot; Xu sighed rubbing the bridge of her 
nose.

&quot;I can try.&quot; Rinoa said giving in.

&quot;The auto-pilot should be able to handle it, I need you to just be there 
incase it gets out of hand.&quot; She explained.

&quot;Okay, I guess I&#39;ll go, are you okay here by yourself?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Xu said darkly, staring into her laptop.

Rinoa nodded and made her way inside the ship. Once on the bridge she 
settled into the pilot&#39;s seat and stared at the controls blankly.

&quot;I can&#39;t remember any of this.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Where the heck is the auto 
pilot?&quot;

A quiet beep caught her attention and she looked down. A blinking switch 
caught her attention.

&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; She remembered and flipped it. Without warning the ship&#39;s 
engines ignited and within moments the craft was airborne.

Xu ducked flying debris and held her laptop steady as the roar of the 
engine&#39;s buffeted her. The Ragnarok hovered a moment before shooting off 
into the night sky.

******************

Aeka awoke to find that her head was killing her. Sitting up, she looked 
around weakly trying to get her bearings. It was dark, the only light 
coming from the smoldering embers that drifted down from a shaft that 
stretched far above her.

She stood gingerly, her head swimming dizzily. She remembered the fire, 
and a crate exploding. Then she remembered being pushed.

&quot;Royce! Fujin!&quot; She screamed as she recalled what happened.

They had almost made it out of the building, then a crate exploded, 
dropping the ceiling and blocking their exit. They tried to find another 
way out then Fujin spotted an elevator. Looking around again Aeka 
realized she was indeed at the bottom of an elevator shaft, on top of 
the elevator itself to be precise. It wouldn&#39;t work, so they had 
prepared to climb down when another explosion brought down more of the 
ceiling. Royce was cut off from them unable to get around a pile of 
burning debris. The last thing Aeka remembered was Fujin shoving her 
into the open elevator shaft.

&quot;Royce!&quot; She called again pleadingly. No answer came. Looking up, some 
twenty feet she saw the shaft sealed by burning rubble.

&quot;Fujin!&quot; She called, praying for an answer. No answer, in a growing 
state of panic she clambered around in the darkness looking for someway 
to get out. Finally she found something she hoped was a lever and yanked 
it with all her might. There was a click and she soon found herself 
falling again. Luckily the fall was short; staggering to her feet she 
was relived to find the elevator door&#39;s open and leading into a room. 
Cautiously she poked her head out; the room was lit with ominous, red 
emergency lighting. Water sloshed around her feet as she walked, the 
area was flooded to about her ankles.

&quot;Hello?&quot; She called meekly, wherever she was it was cold. The room was 
sparse except for a desk that next to a security door. A cup of coffee 
and a doughnut sat unattended on the desk, as if someone left it in a 
hurry. She approached the security door cautiously, beside the doorknob 
was a keypad that was blinking erratically. She looked at the door a 
moment, her mind going back to all the late night horror movies she had 
watched with her friends. Some hormone-laden teen would go up to a 
strange door in the dark and open it, only to be impaled by a hacked to 
death by a madman with a knife.

&quot;Like I needed to think that.&quot; She grumbled to herself. Taking a deep 
breath she tried the door, with a click it swung open easily. There were 
no monsters waiting to eat her brains or madmen with knives, only a long 
dark hallway lined with doors very similar to the one she just opened. 
The emergency lights flickered and buzzed erratically, she could only 
assume they&#39;d soon go out and she&#39;d be stranded, fumbling around in the 
darkness. Having lost her night vision goggle in the chaos prior to the 
explosion, she&#39;d given anything for a flashlight.

Steadying herself mentally she took a deep breath and tried to relax. 
Unsure, as to which way to go she decided to head towards the end of the 
hall, hopefully there&#39;d be exit. She tried her best to keep her mind off 
the possible fates of her friends, she keep telling herself that Fujin 
had experience and would see all of them through this safely. She 
giggled slightly; she could imagine them all wondering where she was, 
sitting around, mission over, bragging, sharing stories.

&quot;And here I am stumbling around in the dark like a idiot.&quot; She sighed.

*******************

Quistis stood quietly eye&#39;s closed, trying to focus and gather strength. 
Meanwhile the cadets had gathered around her in a defensive pattern. 
Trying desperately to hold off the swarms of creatures that pushed ever 
closer.

&quot;Quistis hon I hope you have a plan, this is -not- a situation I call 
optimistic.&quot; Celest said with a half-smile.

&quot;Everyone down.&quot; Quistis shouted suddenly opening her eyes. It&#39;d been a 
long time since she called upon the forces of her blue magic, especially 
the more destructive ones.

A globe of swirling white light erupted from her spreading outward. 
Celest squinted and looked up in wonder as the globe encircled their 
group and engulfed the legion of wraith like monsters. She felt nauseous 
as the wave passed through her, as if the world started to roll back and 
forth like a turbulent ocean. One by one each creature was trapped in a 
sphere of crackling white energy and lifted into the air. Overhead a 
vortex of glowing white energy swirled and sparked angrily, Quistis was 
directly under the eye of the storm standing calm, her brow glistening 
with sweat as she struggled to maintain control of the storm.

****************

&quot;Whoa! Check it out!&quot; Zell shouted grabbing Irvine by the ponytail and 
pointing out through a large bay window.

&quot;Hey you little punk watch the...hair.&quot; Irvine trailed off. Squall 
turned to see what was going on just as a white light exploded into the 
room. The entire building started shaking and soon it rumbled down to 
its foundation. Outside, white clouds swirled overhead forming what 
looked like a small hurricane. Sheets of lightning struck the ground in 
rapid bursts sending debris flying everywhere. Suddenly a multitude of 
glowing spheres rose from the ground. They hung in the air a moment 
before being sucked in and devoured by the accelerating vortex. As soon 
as the last sphere entered the clouds the entire thing exploded into a 
terrible shower of crackling energy, the shock wave shattered every 
window within a mile radius, blowing Squall, Irvine and Zell hard to the 
floor. Then abruptly all was quiet.

*****************

&quot;What the holy hell was that!&quot; Celest shouted in bewilderment as she 
struggled to her feet. Quistis opened her eyes and tottered slightly 
before falling to her knees.

&quot;Whoa, hey!?&quot; Celest crouched by her worriedly.

&quot;You okay, that was some impressive light show?&quot;

Still quite deaf Quistis didn&#39;t respond. She felt horrible, drained, 
it&#39;d been too long since she had to use something of that magnitude. Not 
prepared for the drain the magic demanded it was all she could do to 
stay conscious.

Thoughts of Fujin kept her awake and focused. Whatever the outcome, she 
would not rest until she found her.

***************

Zell coughed up a cloud of dust as he rolled over on his back and 
groaned. The blast caught him off guard and he fell hard.

&quot;Thank goodness.&quot; Squall sighed, sitting up.

&quot;Was that a shockwave pulsar?&quot; Irvine asked rubbing his head.

&quot;Yeah, Quistis learned it during the fight with Ultimecia.&quot; Squall 
explained.

&quot;That was cool, I bet that took out whatever they were having trouble 
with. Way to Miss Trepe, kick ass!&quot; Zell shouted excitedly.

&quot;Quit standing around we have to hurry.&quot; Squall ordered. The three of 
them made their way into the heart of the house. A large living room 
stretched out before them, the one room was easily as large as one of 
their apartments. A massive television dominated one of the far walls 
and a fully stocked bar adorned the other.

&quot;Killer pad man.&quot; Zell whistled.

&quot;Anyone want a drink?&quot; Irvine chuckled examining a bottle of wine.

&quot;Cut the antics, Zell which way?&quot; Squall scowled.

&quot;Um, lets see.&quot; Zell grumbled trying to remember the floor plans the 
mayor gave him. He turned thoughtfully and pointed to an ornately carved 
wooden double door. &quot;Through there, it should lead to the nurse&#39;s room, 
den, and master bedroom.

&quot;Hey boss, I&#39;m beginning to get a funny thought.&quot; Irvine said, looking 
around with a frown.

&quot;Speak your mind.&quot; Squall said curiously.

&quot;We&#39;ve yet to encounter any resistance, and Quistis and her group sound 
like they&#39;re fighting a war.&quot;

&quot;Yeah man, it&#39;s weird, especially now that it&#39;s hit the fan, someone or 
something should&#39;ve found us. I mean we&#39;re not being terribly subtle.&quot; 
Zell added as he headed toward the doors.

&quot;Shit!&quot; Squall spat as if something bad dawned upon him. Zell and Irvine 
looked at each other in surprise at Squalls momentary outburst.

&quot;You&#39;re right, this whole thing stinks.&quot; Squall cursed and drew his 
gunblade.

&quot;What&#39;s up boss?&quot; Zell asked looking about cautiously.

&quot;This has to be a set up, either to lure us away or a trap.&quot; Squall 
frowned then tried his headset again. &quot;Xu are you there?&quot;

&quot;Squall! Great to hear your voice, sorry to keep you waiting, thing&#39;s 
are a mess down here.&quot; Xu apologized.

&quot;Hold on a moment.&quot; Squall said, then looked at Zell and Irvine. &quot;Stay 
put guys.&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t we checking the rest of the place out? We&#39;re almost there.&quot; Zell 
said reaching for the double doors.

&quot;Stop, don&#39;t open those doors, we&#39;re in a weapons plant, I wouldn&#39;t be 
surprised if this whole place it rigged to blow. We proceed with 
caution.&quot; Squall said dangerously. Zell pulled his hand away as if 
burned.

&quot;Dude this sucks.&quot; He frowned. Squall switched attention back to Xu.

&quot;Okay, Xu give me a report, how are you doing?&quot;

&quot;I think Quistis has it under control. I&#39;m trying to reestablish all our 
links, the explosion damaged some of my equipment.&quot; Xu paused and 
sighed, she hated this part. &quot;We have casualties.&quot; She said quietly. 
Squall winced but kept calm.

&quot;How many?&quot; He asked darkly.

&quot;Five total, and about seven wounded.&quot; Xu answered.

&quot;Fuck!&quot; Zell blurted in a mix of shock and anger. Irvine stiffened and 
took off his hat sadly.

&quot;Who&#39;d we loose?&quot; Squall asked. His heart hammering in his chest, 
praying Rinoa&#39;s name wasn&#39;t mentioned.

&quot;Christine, Trent, Aeka, Royce.&quot; She paused to gather herself. &quot;And 
Fujin.&quot; She said quietly.

Squall nodded solemnly. &quot;Keep me informed if the situation changes.&quot; He 
said simply and looked to the others. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;

Irvine shook his head and shouldered his rifle and headed toward the 
doors. Zell stood a moment as if lost in thought causing Squall and 
Irvine exchanged wary glances.

&quot;That ain&#39;t fair.&quot; He abruptly shouted.

&quot;Zell.&quot; Squall sighed.

&quot;It&#39;s not man!&quot;

&quot;I know, there&#39;s nothing we can do.&quot; Squall said softly.

&quot;This rots man, it&#39;s full of shit!&quot; Zell cried out in exasperation.

&quot;Zell, come on, we&#39;ll all mourn later. Squall&#39;s right though, there 
isn&#39;t anything we can do now. The main thing is to stop this mess before 
anyone else dies.&quot;

&quot;DAMN IT!&quot; Zell shouted again before going on rampage through the living 
room, chairs, painting, wood and glass, nothing escaped his wrath.

Irvine and Squall watched him sympathetically. Zell was always one ruled 
by his emotions. In a way, Squall envied him at least he expressed them 
freely.

Moving towards him, he put a reassuring on his shoulder.

&quot;Lets go.&quot; He said quietly.

&quot;They&#39;re kids man. That ain&#39;t right.&quot; Zell cried. &quot;It&#39;s not right at 
all.&quot;

&quot;They knew what they signed up for, just like we did. Trying to do the 
right thing hurts sometimes.&quot; Irvine sighed.

&quot;Still.&quot; Zell sighed, his face taunt with sorrow and anger.

&quot;We have to go, now!&quot; Squall said in a respectful but firm tone. &quot;If 
Luccian&#39;s not here, we&#39;ve got to find him before he tries to escape. The 
longer he eludes us the stronger Griever will become.&quot;

Zell nodded, his expression twisting into mournful scowl. &quot;Let&#39;s go kick 
his ass.&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot; Squall nodded in agreement.

Irvine stood before the door with his gun leveled. Squall too had his 
gunblade loaded and ready to fire. Zell knelt and examined the door 
cautiously, checking for any suspicious wiring. Satisfied, he stepped 
back and nodded. Irvine took a step forward and with one mighty kick, 
smashed in the door. All three rushed inside ready to fight. Squall was 
correct in assuming Luccian would be ready for them. What waited for 
them beyond the door was nearly beyond description. A blinding white 
skeletal creature bathed in a green aura. Its form was humanoid, with 
bizarrely long limbs ending in wicked scythe like claws. Its head was 
like a lion&#39;s and from it&#39;s stooped back flapped two sets of angelic 
wings.

The thing&#39;s tail, similar to a scorpion&#39;s but far more flexible, swayed 
lazily behind it. The unnatural green aura shone upon them brightly 
causing them to pause. Then, almost as if bored it opened it maw and 
from it issued forth a roar so terrible it rattled them to the core. The 
vibration shattered the walls, and knocked Irvine&#39;s and Squall&#39;s weapons 
from their hands. To add insult to injury the force of it slammed the 
three of them back into the living room. Squall was first one to his 
feet. He snarled and started to call forth a Guardian to assist them. 
The shimmering image of Ifrit started to manifest around him and the 
creature beyond the doors locked its eyes on him.

The thing&#39;s eye&#39;s glinted with a malevolent spark and the ghostly image 
of Ifrit roared in pain then vanished into a puff of smoke a fire. 
Squall&#39;s eye&#39;s rolled back into his head and he collapsed back into 
Zell&#39;s arms. Irvine, always prepared, stepped in front of them and from 
under his coat pulled out a shotgun. Without a second thought he opened 
fired. The blast caught the beast square in the face. Howling in pain 
the creature shimmered translucent and started to sink through the 
floor.

Irvine ran to the spot, hoping to follow but was sorely disappointed, 
the creature had escaped. A quick check over revealed all three of them 
were bleeding from their ears and noses.

&quot;That was Greiver! Downstairs!&quot; Squall groaned, trying to stand.

&quot;Dude are you alright!&quot; Zell asked, worried.

&quot;Ifrit. My junction shattered.&quot; Squall choked, feeling drained, and 
spent.

&quot;Just like with Ultimecia, we have to get him fast, the longer this 
takes the worse he&#39;s gonna break us down piece by piece.&quot; Zell shouted.

&quot;I got a good hit on him.&quot; Irvine nodded. &quot;You were right Squall, he&#39;s 
no where near full power.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s why we better hurry.&quot; Squall grunted as Zell and Irvine helped 
him to his feet.

&quot;You going to be okay?&quot; Zell asked holding him by the arm.

&quot;Yeah, Eden&#39;s taking over.&quot; Squall nodded, one of the benefits of having 
multiple guardians, was that if one was taken out the others could take 
up the slack. By the time the three of them reached the lower floor 
Squall was back to form.

************************

By the time Rinoa arrived back at Balamb Garden, Edea was waiting for 
her in the clearing outside. Seifer, Nicole and Selphie stood with her 
waiting patiently. Seifer&#39;s guards had been dismissed and he stood 
behind Edea. The Ragnarok landed fast and the hatch was already opening 
before the ship had even settled. Rinoa burst from the hatch in a near 
panic.

&quot;I&#39;m am not Flying that thing again!&quot; She shouted angrily.

&quot;Why what happened?&quot; Selphie asked.

&quot;Stupid auto pilot flies like a madman. It took off without me telling 
it to!&quot; Rinoa pointed in exasperation at the head of the ship.

&quot;You probably hit something by accident.&quot; Nicole said.

Edea moved past them and headed up the ramp Seifer followed behind her 
wordlessly.

&quot;I&#39;ll fly!&quot; Selphie volunteered, of course everyone knew she had an 
ulterior motive, but the fact remained, she was better trained to fly 
the ship than Rinoa.

&quot;Very well child, hurry along. Time is of the essence.&quot; Edea sighed.

&quot;You guys please be careful.&quot; Nicole called to them as they climbed 
aboard and closed the hatch.

Selphie hopped into the pilot&#39;s seat and rubbed her hands together.

&quot;Okay let&#39;s see.&quot; She mumbled, flipping switches. Soon they were aloft 
and well on their way. The journey back to the compound took longer than 
any of them would&#39;ve liked. Edea sat quietly in her seat, a meditative 
look in dark eyes. No one had spoken since lift off and the silence was 
unnerving. Rinoa sat back, sullen and quiet, so many thing&#39;s had gone 
wrong and so fast. Seifer sat by her side; he too was withdrawn and 
brooding.

Rinoa slowly looked over at him and their eyes met. She offered a small 
somber smile.

&quot;How have you been?&quot; She asked having a terrible urge to talk to 
someone, anyone.

&quot;What?&quot; Seifer asked dully, his mind obviously not paying attention.

&quot;You&#39;re looking good, bulked up some.&quot; Rinoa shrugged. &quot;I guess I should 
go live on a island for a year, I&#39;m to soft.&quot; She sighed, feeling 
stupid.

Seifer sat up and blinked in confusion before looking at her 
flabbergasted.

&quot;What?&quot; He said again, looking at her bewildered, she&#39;d successfully 
gotten his attention.

&quot;Sorry.&quot; She said sheepishly. &quot;I&#39;m stressed out, it helps me to talk to 
someone.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; He nodded, his voice was morose, and no longer had the edge it 
usually carried. Rinoa remembered that voice; she remembered how he 
could be at times.

Soothing, calm, passionate, she had no regrets about leaving him, but 
she did remember what they shared during that brief time before 
everything went wrong.

&quot;It&#39;s no fun, I don&#39;t recommend it.&quot; Seifer said dryly.

&quot;I was kidding.&quot; Rinoa sighed.

&quot;I know.&quot;

&quot;You alright?&quot; She asked.

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;I take it you heard.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;I feel like I have to apologize.&quot; Rinoa sighed sadly.

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;I treated her like crap.&quot;

&quot;Why? I&#39;m the one who caused all the trouble.&quot; Seifer admitted with a 
frown. &quot;Fujin never asked for any of it.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s honestly not about you.&quot;

&quot;What then?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just selfish, a selfish brat.&quot; She sighed rubbing her 
temples.

&quot;No you&#39;re not. When we were together.&quot; He started, then frowned he 
didn&#39;t mean to go there. No reason bringing up painful memories. &quot;I 
mean, you were always generous.&quot; He continued.

Rinoa shrugged.

&quot;It&#39;s just that, me and Quistis used to be like sisters. We used to do 
everything together. A few months ago she got moody and stopped coming 
around, not one hardly saw her, it got to the point sometimes we had to 
nearly drag her out of her apartment. Then Fujin appears out of the 
blue, and all of a sudden Quistis starts spending all her time with her 
while I get put on the back burner.&quot; Rinoa sniffed slightly and frowned. 
&quot;Hyne, I&#39;m a idiot. I&#39;m just a stupid girl who needs to grow up. 
Everyone was right, I don&#39;t know anything about the real world. I 
treated her like dirt, because of my on selfish reasons and now she&#39;s 
gone and there&#39;s nothing I can do.&quot;

Seifer looked at her a moment and shook his head.

&quot;Why are you confessing this me this Rinoa?&quot; He said quietly. &quot;You&#39;ve 
hardly said two words to me hardly since I&#39;ve been back.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; She mumbled. &quot;I just needed to get it out, I feel horrible, 
she just wanted to be accepted and we all treated her like a monster. As 
for not talking to you sooner, you&#39;ve got to understand. I mean, what 
could I&#39;ve said?&quot; She sighed sadly. &quot;Oh hi Seifer, I haven&#39;t seen you 
since you tried to feed me to Adel.&quot;

Seifer winced.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry about that, things were.&quot; He sighed and looked up. 
&quot;Everything just, it was not supposed to be like this.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; She said softly. &quot;Sometimes, nothing seems to go right.&quot;

&quot;Can you forgive me?&quot;

&quot;I already had, it wasn&#39;t your fault.&quot; She smiled gently.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure.&quot; He said quietly, barely a whisper.

&quot;What are you saying.&quot; She frowned slightly.

&quot;I&#39;ve discovered, there&#39;s a part of me.&quot; He frowned, pondering how best 
to explain. You heard what happened? With Fujin, all those years ago.&quot; 
He mumbled sounding small, nearly afraid.

&quot;Yes, Squall told me.&quot; She nodded, not really wanting to think about it.

&quot;It&#39;s true, all of it.&quot; He admitted with a shrug.

&quot;I didn&#39;t want to believe it.&quot; She admitted sadly.

&quot;I snapped, I.&quot; He shook hung his head and looked at his hands. &quot;Squall, 
we always competed, always. That day we fought, fought hard, at some 
point...&quot; He shook his head not wanting to think about it. Never before 
had he really looked back on that horrible day. &quot;At some point.&quot; He 
continued. &quot;It stopped being a simple sparring match. Squall beat me, 
beat me sound. All I remember was, that I wanted to hurt him, make him 
pay for embarrassing me. I was supposed to be the best.&quot; He frowned; he 
could feel Rinoa&#39;s eyes on him yet she said nothing.

&quot;I decided then I would kill him, I was irrational, he took from me all 
I ever cared for, my pride. It&#39;s all I had then, it was all foolish, 
stupid.&quot; He rubbed his face angrily and growled in aggravation, more at 
himself than anything else. &quot;Fujin was there, she grabbed me, stopped 
me. Squall left and she yet she still held me. I was so angry; she got 
in the way, made me look like an even bigger fool. I could&#39;ve imagined 
Squall laughing at me. I looked at her, I was hurt, she hurt me, how 
could she have done such a thing, embarrass me like that.&quot; Seifer&#39;s 
voice grew low, somber as he remembered that black day.

&quot;She looked at me, with those piercing trusting eyes. I knew she loved 
me, I always have. But at that moment I hated her, I hated Squall, I 
hated everyone. I don&#39;t even remember hitting her, but I know I did. 
When I realized what I&#39;d done, I thought I killed her so I threw her off 
the cliff hoping to hid my crime.&quot; Seifer looked up, finally facing 
Rinoa. Tears were in her eyes and a look of hurt confusion on her face.

&quot;Of course, she lived. I figured it was only a matter of time, before I 
was locked away. But then, she did the damnedest thing, she covered for 
me and told everyone it was an accident. I never knew why, I never asked 
her, she never mentioned it again, nor did I. Only later did I realize, 
that in a way I did kill her that dark day. She never smiled again, 
never laughed, never did the things she used to love to do.&quot; He shook 
his head and wiped his eyes, in annoyance and swallowed hard. &quot;Did you 
know she was a poet? She told me her mother had taught her how. A long 
time ago, before any of this I found one of her poems.

It&#39;s funny I was rooting through her book bag trying to steal answers to 
a test she&#39;d passed. I had to take it and hadn&#39;t studied for it all 
semester.&quot; He chuckled bitterly. &quot;It was folded up all cute and smelled 
of perfume. Of course being a jerk I opened it and read it.&quot; He smiled 
sorrowfully. &quot;It was about me, full of the whimsical ravings of girl in 
love, and how in her words, the world revolved around my heavenly 
countenance.&quot;

He grew silent; he wasn&#39;t sure what he wanted to achieve by telling 
Rinoa that. Perhaps he needed someone to judge him for his sins. &quot;Part 
of me went with Edea willingly. I felt, it was my chance to finally 
achieve all that I was destined for and I would&#39;ve moved the heavens to 
do it. You, Squall, Fujin, all of you, to me, you were either tools or 
obstacles. Everyone was right to not trust me; I&#39;m a monster.&quot;

He stood up to move away, not feeling worthy to even be close to her.

&quot;You&#39;ve changed though. I mean, you must have, you know you were wrong, 
right?&quot; Rinoa said shakily her expression torn. She&#39;d never honestly 
thought Seifer capable of doing all those horrible things on his own. 
But here he was, baring the whole ugly truth to her.

&quot;I&#39;d like to think so.&quot; He said softly, looking back to her. &quot;I went to 
that island to find myself, to discover who, what I wanted to be, and to 
try and do the right thing. I had dreamed I could come back wash all my 
sins away, find the happiness I longed for. I guess I was just fooling 
myself, when Fujin turned me down, the same anger returned, the same 
feeling of wounded pride.&quot; He said sounding truly disappointed. &quot;As hard 
as I tried, nothing changed, and Fujin knew it.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know what to say.&quot; Rinoa frowned; her face was drawn with shock 
and a deep sense of disappointment. She sniffed, and looked at him. &quot;I 
mean you pretty much just told me that you honestly wanted us dead, even 
me. I did nothing to you; you were the one to who ran away from me. Hyne 
knows the people in Trabia did nothing to you.&quot; She hissed under her 
breath. &quot;Seifer, if Selphie ever hears what you just said, she will kill 
you. As it stands she just hates you and thinks she&#39;s being irrational, 
and Fujin, poor Fujin, she deserves to have found a friend like Quistis 
after what you did.&quot; She nearly shouted.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know what to do Rinoa, everything&#39;s fallen apart. I only wanted 
to make things right. Griever got free, and now Fujin&#39;s gone, I can 
never make it up to her. There is nothing else for me to do.&quot; He sighed 
and fell back in a seat opposite of Rinoa&#39;s Rinoa ran a hand through her 
hair, this was nearly more than she could bear.

&quot;Seifer, tell Edea, she can help you, it&#39;s not to late. I truly believe 
you&#39;re not as evil as you try to make out. You can still make amends 
somehow.&quot;

&quot;No, I know what I have to do. When this is over, I&#39;m going to Cid and 
Squall and tell them the truth. I suspect there is more than a few 
cities that would be happy to put me on trial. It&#39;s time I face the 
repercussions of my actions.&quot; He said firmly.

Rinoa nodded slowly, she couldn&#39;t argue with him if everything he said 
was true.

&quot;I understand.&quot; She said quietly.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; He smiled sadly.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe this is happening.&quot; Rinoa whispered under her breath.

Seifer said nothing else for the rest of the trip. Soon the ship&#39;s 
passengers could see flickering glow of fires burning on the horizon.

&quot;We&#39;re almost there.&quot; Selphie announced as she pressed the throttle. 
With a burst, the Ragnarok shot across the sky and over the horizon.</pre>
