<h1>Everybody Else's Girl (part 5 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff8/index.html">Final Fantasy  8</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/pphelan.html">Patrick Phelan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff8/everygirl-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Almost all SeeD cadets showed a nearly morbid interest in the blood of 
monsters. Xu remembered, many times, breaking up a group hanging around 
outside a Xenobiology class and discussing in firelight ghost story 
voices if Grendels bled green, or if Ruby Dragon blood boiled, or if 
Malboro blood was even more poisonous than Malboro breath. Earlier than 
that - though those memories were hazy - she remembered being in one of 
those groups, and stating with absolute conviction that Gayla blood was 
highly acidic and would burn a SeeD&#39;s arm off to the elbow.

If Xu was in one of those groups now, she could say with firsthand 
experience that the blood of Blue Dragons was, indeed, blue, and thick, 
and that it spouted from almost any wound dealt to the dragon and stuck 
to skin and clothes.

The dragon&#39;s blood spattered over Quistis&#39; clothes somehow made her no 
less impressive. She seemed not to dance through the Blue Dragons that 
charged at the Ragnarok, but almost to walk through them, seeming to 
expend no effort, to find a perfect path through teeth and claws and 
poison breath and strike without fear of reprisal. The point of her whip 
always found an eye, or a throat, or another undefended area. Xu 
remembered an excellent Training Centre fighter, but the woman in front 
of her seemed almost like a GF.

As Quistis turned to engage one of the few dragons left, Xu raised her 
hand to her head, and pointed outwards. Within herself, she saw a temple 
built a thousand years ago, and a priestess sitting in its centre, 
closed-eyed, and as Xu&#39;s eyes closed Olympia&#39;s opened, and she rode out 
on hurricane winds to hurl a storm of javelins at the dragons before 
them. As two fell, Quistis turned and snapped her whip into the eye of 
the third, which reared back screaming before toppling over.

Quistis turned to face Xu, and smiled. &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;I broke Regulation 26F, didn&#39;t I?&quot; Xu replied, smiling herself.

Quistis replied with something that might have been I won&#39;t hold it 
against you, but her voice was drowned out by a viciously loud roar. 
Another dragon, scales not sapphire but ruby, was making its way around 
the blind side of the Ragnarok, with a mouth full of fire. Quistis 
raised her whip and muttered the first few words of a paramagical spell, 
and Xu reached out to touch Olympia again, and then the side of the Ruby 
Dragon was riddled with holes, and Xu only noticed that the Ragnarok&#39;s 
grand cannon had been firing as it spun to a halt.

&quot;BOOYAKA!&quot; shouted Selphie from the cockpit, and Xu relaxed. Quistis 
laughed, and started walking back towards the Ragnarok. Xu paused for 
only a moment, to Firaga the dragon corpses into a pyre, and then 
followed her.

* * *

Regulation 108A, Xu invented, sitting just outside the Ragnarok&#39;s single 
bathroom and listening to the shower. A SeeD shall ensure that any and 
all lost dragon-spaceships she brings to the Planet from orbit have more 
than one shower cubicle, to ensure that multiple SeeDs on board can 
shower at the same time without the very thought making them rather 
uncomfortable.

There was no Regulation 108A. Xu reminded herself to advise Cid to take 
it on board, though she decided to drop Regulation 108B: Even if it is a 
good kind of uncomfortable, because that simply makes the SeeD in 
question even more uncomfortable.

&quot;What is this island, anyway?&quot; she called to Quistis.

&quot;From all we can work out, it&#39;s the site of a Lunar Cry from long before 
the Sorceress War. The area isn&#39;t inhabited, so no one&#39;s been here to 
keep the monster population down. Thus, the island is heavily populated 
with powerful monsters. An early explorer who went here once suggested 
that surely this was the island closest to Hell, and the name stuck.&quot;

Xu remembered a few mentions of the Island Closest to Hell in Garden, 
but only a very few. SeeD had no operations here - far too dangerous. 
&quot;Then why are we here?&quot;

&quot;Squall wants to upgrade our weapons before we return to the castle, and 
Doomtrain needs rare items to do it. Apparently, a great deal of those 
items can be found here.&quot; The shower stopped running, and Xu heard the 
door slide aside. &quot;Also, the island is an abundant source of paramagic. 
Even more so than the Deep Sea Research Centre.&quot;

That reminded Xu of Quistis telling the story of their trip into the 
Centre, and of transferring her Curagas soon after meeting Quistis on 
the Ragnarok. There had been a power inside Quistis&#39; mind, something 
strong enough to shock Olympia into total silence, and Xu had 
experienced a brief hallucination - she had been standing on a great 
blue disc, with the universe stretching out on all sides of her, and a 
voice had echoed from all sides: I AM EDEN.

And that GF - much though it seems it could rend the universe asunder 
should it so choose - is the least of her growth. She&#39;s changed in so 
many ways since she last left Garden. Xu paused, and re-evaluated her 
thoughts. No, it was since the mission to Timber. I&#39;ve not seen her 
nearly enough since then, but I was fighting with Garden administration 
- especially after NORG - and she was... saving the world, it seems.

&quot;I&#39;m very sorry about this,&quot; Quistis said, emerging through the door in 
a cleaner outfit.

&quot;About what?&quot; Xu asked.

&quot;About...&quot; Quistis started, and then laughed humourlessly. &quot;Where to 
begin? Thanks to me, you&#39;re stuck in a time compressed world where as 
far as we know, no one but us and the monsters is alive.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Xu shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I should have been with you from 
the start.&quot;

Quistis smiled, and they walked back towards her quarters.

&quot;What are your plans now?&quot; Xu asked.

&quot;When we have all our weapons upgraded, Squall intends for us to spend 
one more day...&quot; Quistis laughed again, with just as little humour. &quot;I 
apologise. Twenty four more hours by the ship&#39;s clock, whatever that 
would turn out to be in this world, to rest and consult and see if we 
are ready. If we decide we are, we will return to the door to 
Ultimecia&#39;s place and time, storm her castle, and kill her. Hopefully, 
if we are successful, Time Compression will never have happened.&quot;

&quot;I should come with you,&quot; Xu said, suprising herself with her rashness. 
Xu never made a decision like that without hours of careful thought.

Quistis shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m afraid that wouldn&#39;t work out.&quot;

&quot;What else can I do?&quot;

&quot;Xu...&quot; A pause. &quot;If we are not successful, there will need to be 
another path we can follow. There might be more doors, like the ones 
that lead to the castle. One might lead you home, or to another time 
that you can work from. We need to stop Ultimecia somehow.&quot;

Outwardly, Xu remained completely silent, but her thoughts were in a 
roil. I&#39;m insurance in the case of your death? To find some door that 
likely doesn&#39;t exist, to lead a team that would have none of your 
brilliance to a similarly impossible task? Oh, Quistis, I want to fight 
with you...

...but you are Quistis Trepe, and I will let you decide for yourself.

&quot;Very well,&quot; she said, eventually, and Quistis smiled the smile of a 
woman condemned to death.

* * *

&quot;Well,&quot; Quistis said to Xu, thirty one nonexistent hours later. She 
paused after that, and seemed stuck for a continuation.

Wish me luck? Xu thought. I&#39;ll see you when the world is saved? Remember 
me to Cid and Edea? I&#39;ll miss you?

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, again, Xu,&quot; Quistis said.

&quot;Don&#39;t be,&quot; Xu replied.

Quistis raised a hand, in a gesture of farewell that was not and could 
never be significant enough for such an important event. Hesitantly, she 
turned to go.

&quot;Wait,&quot; said Xu, making the fastest decision of her life, and caught 
Quistis&#39; wrist, and kissed her.

For a brief period, there was complete silence.

&quot;Good luck,&quot; said Xu, rather lamely.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Quistis, smiling warmly. She touched Xu&#39;s wrist for a 
moment, a gesture that felt far more intimate than it had any right to.

Then she turned, and went to fight the battle for time itself.

Regulation 109A, Xu thought to herself. A SeeD shall make a decision if 
she wants to kiss another SeeD far in advance, so that a global 
Apocalypse shall not make the decision for her. She paused for a moment, 
and then thought of another one. Regulation 109B, a SeeD shall not be an 
idiot.

She walked out of the door, to sit in the cockpit and wait for Quistis 
to come back.</pre>
