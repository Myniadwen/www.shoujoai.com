<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Headmistress? Xu? Hello? Xusie?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Blinking as her eyes filled with bright 
light, Xu dragged herself back into the world of the living. Momentarily 
disorientated, she dropped the pen that had been drooping in her mouth 
onto the pages of files she had spread all over her lap. Her chair tilted 
violently as she shifted her weight badly, and she had to scrabble furiously 
to collect the papers as they went flying.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Mmm, what? Who’s there?!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She looked over at the door, and saw 
Quistis standing leaning in the doorway, arms folded with an amused, 
chastising look on her face. Hadn’t she… oh right, Quis had a key… 
right, right. Wake up Xusie, she thought to herself.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The work of a Headmistress is 
never done, eh? And to think I almost went for this job. If I’d have 
known it meant sleeping in a comfortable chair, in the middle of the 
day… you must be worn out!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu stared blankly back at her, trying 
to think of something to say to her friend’s sarcastic assault. Dazed, 
she swivelled her chair and looked out the window behind her. Sunlight 
streamed in beams into the room, warming her face and confirming the 
inappropriate timing of her nap. Distant sounds of laughter and calls 
could be heard – the sound of the school moving obliviously below 
them.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She turned and looked back, a sheepish 
grin forming on her face. Biting back a laugh, she placed the pile of 
files on her desk. Quistis smiled and inclined her head waiting for 
an answer. Xu fought back her smile, smoothed out the files and took 
the pen up in her hand. It was no good, and she moved her hand up too 
late to catch herself as she burst into an embarrassed laugh.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">For a good minute or so, the two old 
friends giggled and cried with laughter, Xu with her hand over her face, 
sobbing with utterly humiliated, but tickled laughter; Quistis pretending 
to sleep in the chair opposite from time to time. It had been such a 
strange few days, with Fujin so on edge and reading through her files... 
Xu felt like she hadn’t had a good laugh in years. She was so relieved, 
things almost seemed normal again for a moment.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eventually however, they had to come 
to their senses. Still chuckling slightly, and with neither very far 
from another total breakdown, their mirth gradually subsided. A smile 
still twitching at the edges of her mouth, Xu composed herself, and 
threw an empty box of staples at Quistis in mock annoyance, trying to 
force her to get it together. After a few false starts, Quistis finally 
managed:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;So… Headmistress?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Yes… Senior Lecturer?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yearning to let go again, but conscious 
she was in fact neglecting her duties, Xu furiously fought to calm herself:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Oh Quis, come on. If you want 
something…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;My pen&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu almost burst out in hysterics again, 
briefly bewildered at the sheer mundanity of the request.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Mmm-hmm, I think I left it in 
here yesterday. Really!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">With both of them doing their best 
to rein in their insane laughter at this feeble conversation, Xu searched 
through her papers but came up a blank. Shrugging, she held up her pen…</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;There’s this one, but…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Quistis lurched over and snatched it 
mischievously, producing a few papers she had to sign. Clearing her 
throat with a chuckle, she bent over the work… and then fell back 
in her chair holding a hand over her mouth to stifle the laughter.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It’s out of ink!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I know! Serves you right!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another lengthy period of hysterics 
threatened, but Xu held up a hand pleadingly:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;No, no come on. I was up all 
last night; I’ve got work to finish…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Oh?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu looked up at her, and saw her friend 
had become an oasis of calm. Sat up and with her arms folded, she now 
had a deeply interested look on her face.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It’s not like that… at least 
not yet anyway. Oh, I don’t know what it is…&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu’s laughter was fading fast now, 
as the exasperation of the previous few days returned. Quistis leaned 
forward, and drew one of the files round with her finger to look at 
it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It wouldn’t have anything to 
do with a certain young woman here on probation, would it?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu looked down and saw it was hopeless. 
All the files were about Fujin quite obviously, and Quistis’ fan club, 
the ‘Trepeies’ were the most informed gossip network she had ever 
known. This conversation had clearly been Quistis&#39; goal in coming here...</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She knitted her fingers together into 
a bridge, and looked with a sigh at a photo of Fujin (and some others) 
that had been unearthed. Looking across her fingers, she saw Quistis 
was sporting a supportive but concerned look.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;You don’t think it’s a good 
idea?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Quistis picked up the photo, and considered 
it thoughtfully. She shrugged and handed it back.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Teachers and students, teachers 
and other teachers, teachers and teachers who are really just students 
still… it can get very messy&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu pursed her lips defiantly, and slid 
the picture out of sight.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;A teacher trying to get an emotionless 
student to open up to them. A teacher who can’t deny she had more 
than one reason for helping? Sound familiar to anyone?&quot; she enquired 
testily.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Quistis smiled ruefully: &quot;And 
you know how that turned out…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Both of them sat in their thoughts 
for a minute, an awkward silence pervading as the conversation had started 
to strike at some nerves. Quistis finally looked over and remarked:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Look Xusie, it’s just… I 
know I’ve tried it a few times, but it’s never easy. People think 
you’re just throwing your position about and…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu sat back in her chair, and sighed 
with irritation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Take off the gloves Quis, say 
what you really think. You think she’s dangerous, don’t you?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Quistis shifted uncomfortably, before 
turning to look her straight in the eye.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I’m just saying Xuse, the ones 
I’ve dated haven’t tried to destroy the world lately&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu ran her knuckles thoughtfully across 
her mouth, regarding her old friend with what she was afraid was dangerously 
close to hatred at such a poisonous statement. She sat up and tidied 
up the files, trying to calm down.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;That’s not very funny, Quis.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Her friend hesitated before replying. 
Xu could feel Quistis was regretting, as indeed she was, that the conversation 
had become so hostile. But she felt so mad at Quis right now for this.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It wasn’t meant to be funny, 
Xuse. Fujin’s a very troubled young woman. This could end very badly… 
for the both of you.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The response was tender and apologetic, 
which soothed Xu, even if it did not particularly reassure her. She 
cupped her chin in her hand, and tapped distractedly on the table. She 
shot glances at Quistis, who was evidently hoping for a cessation of 
hostilities.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I… you’re probably right. 
And I’m sorry if I sound…&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Hey, it’s okay. I didn’t 
mean to upset you either&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">They touched fingers briefly to show 
they were both past the last few minutes. It was a level of intimacy 
most wouldn’t understand really. Loving without ever needing to tell 
the other it was purely platonic. It was a relationship she’d always 
drawn great strength from.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;She’s just so miserable, Quis. 
My heart breaks every time I see her. In the past, it just wasn’t… 
she was always part of that gang. I didn’t think it could ever happen. 
And I don’t want her or anyone to think I’m just using my position 
now for some cheap thrills.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She looked up at her old friend, emotion 
brimming inside her.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I have to be with her Quis. I 
can’t think of anything else, I don’t want to <i>do</i> anything 
else.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Quistis nodded and sighed deeply, before 
reaching her hand over and giving Xu’s arm a comforting squeeze.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Then I guess I’d better hear 
it all then.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu ran quickly over some of the events 
of the previous days, leaving out a few bits here and there to preserve 
Fujin’s dignity. Quistis lay slumped back in her chair with her feet 
up listening, nodding as she sorted through what she knew of the girl 
in question, and her memories of their run-ins.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It’s the father though, I bet 
you&quot; she said at length, looking over at Xu.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Why she’s like this at all, 
I mean. Dresses how she does, hung with Seifer and Raijin trying to 
be ‘one of the boys’, that speech… kind of military, I always 
thought&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu nodded, and flipped through a few 
pages in the files.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Her father is ex military. She’s… 
yes, an only child. Uhh, I remember reading all this at about 3 o clock 
last night. Father used to take her hunting apparently…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Quistis raised an eyebrow and leaned 
over to look at her. They nodded at each other.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;A father who takes his daughter 
hunting… but I bet he never took her to any balls, or bought her any 
dolls, right?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu shrugged, but Quis was probably 
right. She’d also gotten the distinct impression that Fujin’s father 
had gotten a daughter, when he really wanted a son, and had just ‘made 
do’.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It’s when it happened… the… 
you know.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu motioned to her eye, embarrassed 
and feeling herself flushing red in the face. She felt so… devious 
talking behind Fujin’s back like this, even if she was only trying 
to help. Deeply uncomfortable now, she passed the file to Quistis and 
sat wringing her hands miserably.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Hunting accident… rifle backfires…&quot; 
Quistis shook her head sadly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;But she clearly still idolises 
him, probably feels she let him down.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu snorted in outrage, and got up to 
stalk darkly about the room, her long skirt swishing angrily with her 
movements. Quistis didn’t look up from the file, but commented:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;That’s a bit of a new look 
for you isn’t it? More… Headmisstressy, hmm?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu looked around with a pestered look. 
What did that have to do with anything?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;You think I’m wearing this 
to impress her? To make myself seem more…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Powerful?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu slumped back down into her chair. 
She felt like such a fraud. Smart and capable, best in her class… 
ha! One (admittedly gorgeous) girl with a sob story and she was…</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;So…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu snapped back from her reverie, lost 
in thoughts of Fujin and herself in a thousand different scenarios, 
each more unlikely than the last.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i>&quot;I hope you will agree that 
Fujin is a well disciplined candidate. If taught well and kept motivated, 
I am confident you will find Fujin to be a worthy SEED in the years 
to come. As a military man myself, I hope Fujin will live up to the 
standards of service and honour that my family have always cherished.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Quistis read this aloud with evident 
distaste, and threw it back onto the table. Xu picked it up, she’d 
almost torn this one up, the first time she’d read it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;That man has a lot of problems, 
I’d say&quot; ventured Quistis.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu gripped the page angrily in her 
hands, seized again with the desire to rip it into shreds and burn it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;He doesn’t even refer to her 
as ‘She’ or ‘Her’. It’s all my career and my family, nothing 
about her really. It’s awful: it’s like he can’t bear the ‘shame’ 
of her not being a boy, and thinks if he doesn’t mention it, it might 
all ‘fix’ itself somehow.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Quistis nodded and reached over to 
the file, retrieving a page from the court record section. She turned 
it towards Xu and tapped near the bottom.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;That’s the important detail, 
Xuse. Confront her with that one, and you’ll get to where you both 
want this to go.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xu looked carefully where she was pointing, 
before the words sunk in.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;You think… she wants me too?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Her voice was trembling at the mere 
thought. She tried not to sound so excited, but it was like finding 
out God was real, and he was coming over for lunch to tell you the meaning 
of life.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Before she could get an answer, there 
was a smart knocking at the door. Quistis looked over, mouthed ‘I’ll 
get it’ to Xu, and struggled up from her seat. Xu continued to stare 
down at the pages, lost in thought until:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Oh… Fujin. Hello, are you here 
to see the Headmistress?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Oh Quis, could you sound any 
more suspicious&quot;, thought Xu frantically as she snatched together 
all the files into one pile. Before she could put them out of sight 
however, Fujin marched into the room, practically walking straight through 
Quistis who had tried in vain to body block her. Lacking any better 
alternatives, Xu simply placed her elbows on the pile, and leant forward 
over it trying her best to smile in welcome.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This she found was not hard, as she 
became conscious that she was beaming a wild, happy grin from ear to 
ear. Fujin’s rigid stance relaxed somewhat she noticed when she met 
her gaze. The moment was too short though, as Fujin tore her gaze away 
to Quistis and stared rudely and unblinkingly at her.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Taking the hint before Xu had to say 
or do anything, Quistis backed through the door hastily:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Well, I’m done I think, Headmistress. 
I’ll leave you two alone then.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Outside the door, where Fujin couldn’t 
see her, she smiled encouragingly and motioned to her hip. Xu glanced 
back at Fujin and saw the piece of paper she was holding. She looked 
back to Quistis, nodded at her, and motioned her to close the door.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, this was certainly going to be 
interesting…</font></p>
