Fujin awoke with somewhat of a start. Looking around, she groaned softly 
and ran a hand through her tangled hair. Smiling softly, she moved over 
slightly, searching the mound of blankets and sheets beside her. After a 
brief bit of searching she was startled to find a pair of feet where 
Quistis&#146; head should have been.

Giggling slightly, she traced a fingertip along the bottoms of said feet 
hoping to tickle their owner awake.

It started with a murmur, then a snorting giggle, muffled, distant. 
Within in moments the mound of blankets began to stir and thrash about. 
Fujin, saw an opportunity and firmly wrapped an arm around Quistis&#146; 
legs, and tickled her furiously. Quistis, now fully awake, was caught up 
in the throes of unrelenting laughter.

&quot;Lemmi go! Lemmi go! Lemmi Go!&quot; She babbled, trying to free herself from 
the blankets and Fujin&#146;s grip.

&quot;STINKY FEET.&quot; Fujin grumbled, refusing to relinquish her tactical 
advantage.

&quot;Stop it!&quot; Quistis gasped between breaths, still trying desperately to 
squirm free. &quot;Please! I have to pee!&quot; She managed, pleadingly.

Fujin, looked down at her skeptically a moment then huffed before 
letting her go.

&quot;Brat!&quot; Quistis scowled playfully, sliding out of bed and scampering to 
the bathroom. Fujin sat up and yawned hugely, glancing at the nearby 
clock she sighed, they&#146;d have to hurry if they wanted to make it to 
breakfast.

&quot;OUCH!&quot; Quistis yelped from the bathroom. Fujin hurried to the door and 
knocked lightly.

&quot;I&#146;m okay, the water is scorching hot, for some reason.&quot; Quistis 
whimpered slightly as she came out holding her hand.

&quot;Be careful when you take a shower.&quot;

&quot;NEED CALL MAINTENANCE.&quot;

&quot;I will, later though.&quot;

&quot;LATE FOR BREAKFAST.&quot;

&quot;I noticed. You do know we&#146;ll be the talk of the town now don&#146;t you?&quot;

&quot;NOT CONCERNED.&quot; Fujin shrugged.

&quot;Sure, you say that now.&quot; Quistis grinned doubtfully.

&quot;REGRETS?&quot; Fujin frowned.

&quot;Oh!? No hon, none at all!&quot; Quistis smiled, kissing her reassuringly. 
&quot;Lets get ready shall we.&quot; She added with a saucy grin, as she pulled 
her into the bathroom with her.

 

&quot;Can you believe it.&quot; Rinoa mumbled under her breath.

&quot;No really, but hey, that&#146;s life.&quot; Kevin shrugged.

&quot;If you say so.&quot; Rinoa shrugged.

&quot;Where&#146;s Squall?&quot; Watts asked curiously.

Rinoa frowned slightly and tossed the biscuit she&#146;d been nibbling on 
back on her plate.

&quot;Asleep, he claims he doesn&#146;t feel good. I think he&#146;s just trying to 
avoid the stink.&quot;

&quot;Oh be nice.&quot; Kevin frowned.

&quot;I am, I told you, I&#146;m not going to worry about it.&quot;

&quot;Uh huh.&quot; Kevin grinned.

&quot;I don&#146;t want to hear it, I&#146;m doubly mad at you mister.&quot; She pointed 
accusingly.

&quot;Oh dear.&quot; Watts mumbled.

&quot;I know where this is going.&quot; Zone chuckled under his breath.

&quot;What did I do?&quot; Kevin balked.

&quot;Celest, for starters. You ran out on her.&quot; Rinoa said, glaring 
slightly.

&quot;Ran out!? It&#146;s not like we were dating, I just turned in for the 
night.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#146;t even say goodbye to anyone, you just up and vanished.&quot;

&quot;Well things were a bit hectic, I didn&#146;t interrupt.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s bull Sir.&quot; Watts noted shyly.

&quot;Hey! Who&#146;s side are you on.&quot; Kevin frowned at him.

&quot;Sorry sir.&quot;

&quot;Hey Watts is right. That was kinda rude, I wouldn&#146;t have skipped out 
like that.&quot; Zones said quietly.

&quot;I don&#146;t think I did anything wrong here, why am I getting the 3rd 
degree.&quot; Kevin said, getting defensive.

&quot;It was mean, just plain mean, she likes you.&quot;

&quot;Likes who?&quot; Selphie yawned, setting her plate down by Rinoa and 
jostling her slightly. &quot;Excuse me trap.&quot; She giggled.

&quot;Harlot.&quot; Rinoa chuckled, shoving her back.

&quot;Who are we talking about?&quot; Selphie beamed inquisitively.

&quot;Kevin, skipping out on Celest last night.&quot;

&quot;Of all the things we could be dishing on and you pick that!?&quot; Selphie 
mumbled in amazement.

&quot;You&#146;re just trying to rile me up.&quot; Rinoa huffed indignantly.

&quot;Who me, never.&quot; Selphie said innocently.

&quot;Look, I&#146;m not interested in her.&quot; Kevin sighed.

&quot;I&#146;d never turn her down.&quot; Zone noted to no one in particular.

&quot;You&#146;re just desperate.&quot; Kevin commented rudely, and immediately 
regretted it.

&quot;Gee thanks.&quot; Zone grumbled the got up to leave.

&quot;Hey Zone wait!&quot; Watts called, rushing after him.

&quot;Zone, come on, I&#146;m sorry.&quot; Kevin called, but it was too little, too 
late.

&quot;Smooth ace.&quot; Selphie frowned disapprovingly.

&quot;Really, that was horrible.&quot; Rinoa sighed.

&quot;I said I was sorry, but look at from my point of view, I&#146;ve had a lot 
to deal with lately.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;ve had a lot to deal with?&quot; Selphie laughed in disbelief.

&quot;Okay, poor choose of words.&quot; Kevin relented. &quot;I&#146;m sure that Celest is a 
great girl and all but...&quot;

&quot;But what?&quot; Rinoa frowned.

&quot;Yeah but what?&quot; Selphie added.

Kevin felt trapped and shrugged helplessly before sighing.

&quot;She&#146;s just to much... to forward... to loud, I mean the way she 
dresses, the way she acts. I don&#146;t need a woman who traipses around like 
that. She&#146;s to wild, to flashy, I&#146;m looking for a nice decent girl not 
a...&quot; Kevin sighed then paused, seeing the darkening scowls on the two 
girls faces.

&quot;Go on...&quot; A voice said quietly behind him. He turned around and winced.

&quot;Not a what?&quot; Celest asked, her hands trembling as she held her plate.

&quot;Um...&quot; Kevin babbled lamely. &quot;Celest...I mean...um...hi...?&quot;

Without saying a word, Celest set her plate down and hurried away.

&quot;Celest.&quot; Kevin started, rising to go after her.

&quot;I think you did enough.&quot; Rinoa frowned, shoving him back in his seat 
before chasing after Celest.

&quot;Asshole.&quot; Selphie grunted as she too gave chase.

&quot;Damn it to hell.&quot; Kevin groaned, burying his head in his hands.

&quot;What the heck was that about?&quot; Quistis asked as she and Fujin 
approached with plates in hand.

&quot;Nothing, I just ate both feet.&quot; He sighed.

&quot;CHARMER.&quot; Fujin said dryly.

&quot;Don&#146;t start...I&#146;ve had my head bitten off enough this morning.&quot;

&quot;I take it this is about Celest, I saw her running off.&quot; Quistis said 
quietly.

&quot;Celest, Celest, Celest, I don&#146;t even know the woman. Why is everyone 
going ballistic at me.&quot;

&quot;We&#146;re kind of a big family around here, they get very defense 
sometimes.&quot; &quot;UNDERSTATEMENT.&quot; Fujin sighed, the memory of her volatile 
encounters with Selphie and Rinoa still vivid in her mind.

&quot;What in the world did you say to her?&quot; Quistis asked curiously.

&quot;Nothing...well...I was just explaining to Rinoa and Selphie why I 
wasn&#146;t interested and Celest overheard me.... She took it the wrong 
way.&quot;

&quot;FINALLY.&quot; Fujin mumbled.

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis asked curiously.

&quot;NOT ONE IN TROUBLE.&quot;

&quot;Cute...can we be serious here.&quot; Quistis sighed.

Fujin rolled her eye and shrugged, then started to eat.

&quot;Man, I think I really hurt her feelings.&quot; He groaned.

&quot;I would say so.&quot;

&quot;CELEST NOT INTERESTED NOW.&quot; Fujin noted with bland optimism.

&quot;Hon...you&#146;re not helping.&quot; Quistis sighed, grinning slightly.

&quot;FINE.&quot; Fujin shrugged again, going back to her food.

&quot;Enough about this, how&#146;s things going with you two?&quot; He asked, hoping 
to change the subject.

&quot;Great.&quot; Quistis beamed.

&quot;No one said anything yet?&quot;

&quot;Nope, but its early, although people are staring.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s to be expected.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s okay, Fujin&#146;s an extrovert, she likes the attention.&quot; Quistis 
joked, thumbing at her.

&quot;LOOK AT ME.&quot; Fujin cheered in quiet sarcasm.

Kevin chuckled and shook his head.

&quot;I want to go back to bed.&quot; Nicole whined, announcing her presence as 
she sat down.

&quot;Hey gal, how are you feeling?&quot; Quistis asked with a smile.

&quot;I&#146;m okay, still reeling from last night though. Wow, what a night.&quot; 
Nicole grinned then looked at unattended plates of food. &quot;Um what&#146;s all 
this?&quot;

&quot;Long story, they belong to Rinoa, Selphie and Celest.&quot; Quistis 
explained, glancing at Kevin.

&quot;Oh I can imagine...what did you say?&quot; Nicole asked him bluntly.

&quot;I don&#146;t want to go into it.&quot; Kevin sighed.

&quot;Alright then.&quot; Nicole shrugged.

&quot;Where&#146;s the guys at, I&#146;ve not seen them all morning?&quot; Quistis asked, 
looking around.

&quot;Zell and Irvine are off working somewhere in the core.&quot;

&quot;Oh fun...&quot; Quistis grinned.

&quot;At least I don&#146;t have to go down there....ick!&quot; Nicole giggled.

&quot;I think I&#146;m going to go now...&quot; Kevin waved, rising from his seat.

&quot;Okay, see you later.&quot; Quistis smiled. &quot;And don&#146;t fret to much about 
Celest, she&#146;s a trooper.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;ll try, thanks.&quot; He said quietly before dumping his tray and leaving.

Nicole watched him leave then turned towards Quistis with a grin.

&quot;You two are positively glowing.&quot; She giggled.

Fujin nearly choked and Quistis blushed slightly. Nicole blinked 
uncomprehendingly then blushed brightly with embarrassment.

&quot;Wait! I didn&#146;t mean like that! I meant.... Happy...I.... Never mind.&quot; 
She ranted then hid her head in her hands.

 

&quot;Zell.&quot; Irvine called as they waded through darkness, deep in Balamb&#146;s 
depths.

&quot;What.&quot; Zell sighed; trying his best to keep up with the taller mans 
strides in the waist deep water.

&quot;What do you think?&quot; Irvine asked thoughtfully.

&quot;About what?&quot;

&quot;You know.&quot;

&quot;Oh...that...&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Um well.&quot; Zell sniffed, trying to filter out the smell of what they 
were wading in. &quot;I look up to Miss Trepe, to me, she can&#146;t do any 
wrong.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s a cope out answer.&quot; Irvine laughed.

&quot;Yeah, well, Its true, and to be honest.&quot; He pauses and inspected a 
suspicious looking pipe cautiously. Seeing nothing of interest, he 
continued. &quot;To be honest, I doesn&#146;t effect me either way. There are 
other things to worry about. Nicole is a little goofy about it, but I 
guess that&#146;s understandable. I mean if you and Squall hooked up I think 
I&#146;d be a little weirder out at first.&quot;

&quot;Me and Squall!?&quot; Irvine laughed. &quot;Why&#146;d you have to him in the 
example.&quot;

&quot;What&#146;s wrong with Squall, besides it&#146;s just hypothetical.&quot; Zell 
chuckled, not seeing the oily black tendril slithering out of the pipe 
he&#146;d just inspected.

&quot;Yeah, okay I got ya, finish your thought.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, now then, as I was saying. Miss Trepe&#146;s happy, Fujin&#146;s happy. 
Well it&#146;s hard to tell with her honestly, but I think she is. So I say, 
what the hell.&quot; Zell shrugged then sniffed.

&quot;Dude...&quot; He scowled.

&quot;What?&quot; Irvine paused, turning to look at him curiously.

&quot;Dude, that&#146;s just wrong, I&#146;m down wind here.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;You farted.&quot;

&quot;The hell I did. You forget where we&#146;re at or what.&quot;

&quot;Aw no, this worse than anything down here so far.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so it has to be me?&quot;

&quot;Nothing else down here.&quot;

&quot;Look I&#146;m telling you it wasn&#146;t.... Wait...I smell it...GODS!?&quot; Irvine 
gagged.

&quot;Hyne!?&quot; Zell coughed, holding his hands over his mouth. &quot;What the hell 
is that!?&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s can&#146;t be good. Turn around, let&#146;s get the hell out of here before 
we choke to death!&quot; Irvine shouted, coughing harshly.

The two sloshed madly up the darkened tunnel towards the dim light of 
the exit, the smell was becoming so overwhelming their eyes burned. 
Finally, after what seemed like an eternity the duo burst from the 
tunnel and crawled madly up a service ladder to an upper level. 
Collapsing into a fit of coughing and nausea, the two looked in disgust 
at each other.

A group of junior rank SEED&#146;s rushed to their aid.

&quot;You okay?&quot; One of the youths asked, helping Zell to his feet.

&quot;Yeah man, thanks.&quot; Zell hacked.

&quot;Quarantine that tunnel. There some kind of gaseous buildup, no one is 
to go in there until we get it vented!&quot; Irvine ordered. &quot;When 
maintenance arrives tell them that they are not to go down there without 
guards.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir.&quot; The other youth nodded briskly then started passing the order 
to the other SEED&#146;s

&quot;What do you think?&quot; Zell breathed, trying to catch his breath.

&quot;Hell I have no idea, smelled like a dead animal, a big one. But down 
here, who knows. I figure it&#146;s better safe than sorry considering how 
little we know about the core.&quot;

&quot;True...hopefully its nothing major.&quot; Zell frowned.

 

A pipe, not much when taken into context, only about a foot in diameter, 
and travelling deep into the buildings superstructure. This far down, in 
the humid darkness of Balamb&#146;s core there was nothing to distinguish it 
from the countless others, a perfect place to hide.

The sound was something akin to a toilet backing up, deep, thick and 
crammed with foulness. Slowly at first, it started to emerge, like a 
perversion of birth. Large fleshy mass, translucent pink and quivering 
as if full of jelly and worms. Wires of countless types crisscrossed the 
mass, as if serving as veins.

Odd bits of electrical devices floated within the growing mass of flesh, 
transistors, capacitors, bulbs and electrodes, all connected, and all 
serving some unknown purpose. With an obscene noise the mass popped free 
of the pipe, freeing a veritable stream of viscera like gore. The deluge 
of flesh and sludge splattered onto the floor in a growing heap, steam 
roiling off it as it pooled together to form a large nightmare of 
pulsing red and pink. Thick cables followed the vile stream and coiled 
through the mass like hot spears, a low, tortured moan issued from 
somewhere deep within the horrid thing as it slowly began to swell.

It was thankful to be free of the pipes, it had been forced to hide 
after its accident. It had been traveling along one of the main cooling 
pipes when it collapsed from its mass. Unexpected and unfortunate as it 
was to be robbed of the precious heat it needed to survive it did take 
advantage of the near disaster. With the power shut down for repairs it 
had the opportunity to add to its considerable mass considerably by 
gorging on the creatures in the training hall and freeing the rest to 
cover it activities.

&quot;Time....&quot; It gurgled wetly as tendrils of flesh and wire slithered out 
from its body. Searching, entwining, and invading, the tendrils slowly 
snaked their way into everything they touched. The very ground pulsed as 
if alive and the entire mass quivered with delight. Within moments it 
had spread to cover and area larger than most homes and showed no signs 
of stopping. But Balamb was massive and it had to go slow to keep 
control. It wasn&#146;t concerned, for if it had anything, it had time.

Squall stood staring in the mirror, the man looking back at him was a 
stranger. He&#146;d never really thought about where he was or even who, 
until last night. Last nights events showed him something about himself. 
He was not himself, he was merely what everyone needed him to be. 
Flowing from day to day, falling into whatever role life required, all 
the while not once being his own person, never walking his own path. 
While he had changed outwardly, he was still the same, featureless soul 
that he&#146;d always been. Sure, he had Rinoa in his life but he was forced 
to ask.

&quot;Do I love her, or did I just become what was expected of me...Like 
always.&quot; He thought with a frown but no answer was forthcoming. With a 
sigh he looked at himself in the mirror.

&quot;Who are you?&quot; He mumbled quietly. Again, there was no answer.

 

The last thing Irvine was expecting to see upon arriving at home was his 
sister sitting in the middle of his living room floor, spoon in hand and 
digging angrily into a large tub of rocky road ice cream. Her makeup was 
streaked as if she&#146;d been crying and the scowl on her usually vibrant 
face made him worry.

&quot;Aw hell what happened now.&quot; He sighed, tossing his coat over a nearby 
chair.

&quot;You smell.&quot; She sniffed before shoving a spoonful of ice cream in her 
mouth.

&quot;What the hell are you doing.&quot; He groaned, snatching the spoon out of 
her mouth and reaching for the tub.

&quot;Mine!&quot; She grumbled, pulling it back to her gruffly.

&quot;Okay, this is just silly, why don&#146;t tell me what has you in such a 
tiff, where&#146;s Selphie?&quot; He grunted, yanking the ice cream away and 
setting it on the coffee table.

&quot;I ran her and Rinoa off, they wouldn&#146;t leave me alone.&quot; Celest 
sniffled.

Irvine looked around as if confused about where he was.

&quot;Um this is our house, not yours.&quot; He said guardedly.

&quot;Sorry.&quot; She sniffed again.

&quot;This is about the Kevin guy isn&#146;t it?&quot; He frowned, taking of his hat 
and running a troubled hand through his hair.

&quot;He&#146;s an asshole.&quot; She pouted.

&quot;What happened, do I need to kill him.&quot; Irvine said darkly.

&quot;Yes.&quot; She huffed.

&quot;Alright.&quot; Irvine nodded quietly and picked his rifle up.

&quot;Cute.&quot; Celest sniffled, grinning slightly.

&quot;I&#146;m not joking, I&#146;ll do it. What did he do?&quot; Irvine frowned.

&quot;He said I was a whore.&quot; She grumbled quietly.

&quot;What!?&quot; Irvine all but shouted in shock. &quot;He said that?&quot;

&quot;Well not in so many words...&quot; She admitted.

&quot;Oh... I was about to say.&quot; He frowned, sitting down on the floor in 
front of her.

&quot;I don&#146;t care anymore, who needs him.&quot; She huffed, folding her arms.

&quot;You&#146;re right, there&#146;s plenty of good guys out there. Hell look at me.&quot;

&quot;To bad you&#146;re my brother.&quot; She grinned.

&quot;Hush now, that&#146;s not something you need to be thinking.&quot; He winced.

&quot;Joking, I&#146;m joking.&quot; She sighed, resting her chin in her palm. &quot;I&#146;m 
sick of men. Perhaps Quistis is right.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Irvine blinked.

&quot;I should see if I can find a good woman.&quot; She said thoughtfully.

&quot;Hey, hey, hey!&quot; Irvine stammered awkwardly. &quot;Don&#146;t even start.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m just babbling, ignore me.&quot; She grinned.

&quot;Okay...but that&#146;s not funny.&quot;

&quot;I thought you said it was cool.&quot; She crooned.

&quot;Yeah when someone other than my sister is doing it. Two gals, that&#146;s 
the stuff of fantasy, and you don&#146;t need to be in them.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re such a guy...&quot; She groaned.

&quot;Yeah...yeah I am.&quot; He grinned wolfishly in thought.

&quot;Ugh, I thought you were supposed to make me feel better.&quot; She chuckled, 
pushing him over as he daydreamed. Falling on his back he sat up and 
grinned.

&quot;Well, you&#146;re smiling at least so I&#146;d say I did my job.&quot; He reasoned.

&quot;Yeah, whatever.&quot; She huffed, and helped him to his feet.

 

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin proclaimed.

&quot;Oh don&#146;t be a stick in the mud, come swimming with us.&quot;

&quot;BUSY.&quot; Fujin groused.

&quot;Liar, I make you&#146;re work schedule, you&#146;re clear till tomorrow.

&quot;DAMN.&quot;

&quot;I can&#146;t believe you tried to lie to me.&quot; Quistis pouted.

Fujin made a face and sighed.

&quot;FINE.&quot;

&quot;Great, and this time you&#146;re getting in.&quot;

&quot;FINE.&quot;

&quot;That was easy.&quot; Quistis giggled cheerfully. &quot;We&#146;ll head over as soon as 
we see Kevin and the guys off.&quot;

&quot;FINALLY.&quot; Fujin grumbled.

&quot;Be nice, he&#146;s a sweet guy.&quot;

&quot;WORRISOME.&quot;

&quot;No he is not. Well...okay...so he&#146;s changed a little. But that&#146;s okay, 
I mean I changed, and Hyne knows you&#146;ve changed.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin said, scoffing at the notion.

&quot;Oh please.&quot; Quistis laughed.

&quot;SAME FUJIN.&quot;

&quot;Sure you are.&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot; Fujin agreed.

&quot;You&#146;re impossible sometimes.&quot;

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Stop that.&quot; Quistis giggled. &quot;You sound like a machine.&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Quit it you brat.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin asked, eyeing her suspiciously.

&quot;The affirmative and negative stuff. Yes and no will suffice, I swear I 
think you do that to be weird sometimes.&quot; Quistis grinned.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; Fujin said blandly, without skipping a beat.

&quot;OH!&quot; Quistis laughed, shoving her playfully.

Fujin grinned, but stayed somewhat stoically then paused and started.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Quistis giggled, following her gaze. A trio of Treppies 
stood in the hall staring awkwardly and looking as if they&#146;d been caught 
at mischief.

&quot;Girls.&quot; Quistis nodded, greeting them.

The three girls looked at each other then back at Quistis.

&quot;Something wrong?&quot; Quistis frowned slightly.

&quot;No...&quot; One of the girls said quietly.

&quot;Lets go.&quot; Another girl spoke, grabbing the first by the arm.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; The last one added as the three hurried away.

Quistis&#146; face fell and she sighed heavily.

&quot;Ouch...&quot; She murmured.

&quot;SORRY.&quot; Fujin said quietly pressing against her warmly as she kissed 
her cheek.

&quot;It&#146;s okay love, I knew there would be some slack.&quot;

&quot;STILL.&quot; Fujin sighed, entwining her hand with hers.

&quot;Thanks hon, lets hurry up before we miss Kevin.

&quot;KAY.&quot; Fujin nodded quietly.

 

Kevin, Zone and Watts stood in the hanger staring up at the Ragnarok. 
Rinoa was there, as were Selphie and Nicole, and none of the women paid 
Kevin any attention, focusing their good-byes on Zone and Watts. Kevin 
rolled his eyes and sighed, he knew they were mad at him for his earlier 
remarks. Better for all that was leaving now since he was making a 
bigger fool of himself by the hour.

&quot;You two behave, and don&#146;t be afraid to come visit more often. It&#146;s been 
to long!&quot; Rinoa beamed, hugging Zone tightly.

&quot;Well guys, I must say...it&#146;s been an interesting visit.&quot; Nicole 
grinned.

&quot;Sorry about your apartment.&quot; Zone mumbled shyly.

&quot;No worries, it wasn&#146;t your fault.&quot; Nicole giggled, giving Selphie the 
evil eye. Selphie glanced back at her indignant shock.

&quot;Don&#146;t blame me, blame that monster you call a pet!&quot; She squeaked, 
before turning her attention back to Zone and Watts.

&quot;Before I forget guys. Irvine and Zell told me to tell you bye, they 
would&#146;ve been here to see you off but Squall has em pulling sewer duty.&quot; 
She explained.

&quot;Where is Squall anyway.&quot; Nicole asked, glancing at Rinoa.

&quot;He&#146;s sleeping in today apparently, he&#146;s not feeling well. But he said 
to take care guys.&quot; Rinoa said, somewhat embarrassed.

&quot;Hi guys.&quot; Quistis called as she and Fujin approached.

&quot;Quisty.&quot; Kevin smiled, thankful for a friendly face.

&quot;There they are.&quot; Selphie grinned, what kept you guys.

&quot;Had to stop by Fujin&#146;s, we&#146;re here though. So guys, I bet you&#146;re glad 
to be out of this mad house.&quot; Quistis grinned.

&quot;Yeah, I think I did enough damage.&quot; Kevin sighed.

&quot;Me too.&quot; Selphie grumbled sourly.

&quot;Selphie...&quot; Rinoa whispered, elbowing her.

&quot;So who&#146;s flying you out?&quot; Quistis asked him.

&quot;I am.&quot; Selphie smirked wickedly.

&quot;I&#146;m going too!&quot; Rinoa giggled.

&quot;They&#146;re going to toss me out over the mountains.&quot; Kevin smirked dryly.

&quot;Probably.&quot; Quistis nodded.

&quot;GOOD IDEA.&quot; Fujin mumbled, causing Quistis to elbow her sharply.

&quot;How&#146;s Celest?&quot; Kevin asked, ignoring Fujin&#146;s comment.

&quot;I don&#146;t know.&quot; Quistis said as Selphie interjected herself into the 
conversation.

&quot;She&#146;s upset you big ape, she really liked you, and you go say those 
awful things about her!&quot;

&quot;Liked me!? She doesn&#146;t even know me!?&quot; Kevin proclaimed.

&quot;You never gave her the chance!&quot; Selphie snapped.

&quot;Yeah!&quot; Rinoa barked.

&quot;Girls, please, lets be adults okay.&quot; Nicole tried feebly.

&quot;Oh Hyne, lets not get choked up on good-byes.&quot; Quistis snapped in 
annoyance, causing everyone to grow silent.

&quot;Sorry Quisty.&quot; Selphie winced.

&quot;Lets just go.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;You&#146;re going too?&quot; Kevin smirked curiously.

&quot;Yes, I don&#146;t want them ganging up on you during the flight.&quot; Quistis 
said sourly, glancing at the innocent looking Selphie and Rinoa.

&quot;You coming too Nicole?&quot; Selphie asked as everyone prepared to climb 
aboard.

&quot;I&#146;d rather not, I&#146;m still kinda wary of that thing. It looks like it 
could fall apart at any moment.&quot; Nicole mumbled, nodding towards the 
Ragnarok.

&quot;Ohhhh!&quot; Selphie said in a scandalous tone. &quot;Better not let Zell hear 
you say that.&quot; She giggled.

&quot;Why, you&#146;d break his little heart.&quot; Rinoa grinned.

&quot;Okay, you clowns lets get going.&quot; Quistis prodded. &quot;Nikki we&#146;ll meet 
you at the pool when we get back okay?&quot;

&quot;Yeah sure.&quot; She grinned. &quot;See you guys, it&#146;s been fun.&quot; She added, 
waving farewell.

&quot;Fu?&quot; Quistis asked, glancing at her.

&quot;STAYING.&quot; Fujin answered, not wishing to get entangled in whatever 
arguments were bound to happen during the journey to Timber. Selphie 
ginned hugely at her.

&quot;Aw you big chicken.&quot; She said laughingly before skipping up the 
gangplank.

&quot;Well okay then.&quot; Quistis grinned at the glowering Fujin. &quot;Nicole, keep 
her out of trouble while we&#146;re gone.&quot;

&quot;Sure thing!&quot; Nicole laughed, throwing her arm around Fujin&#146;s shoulders.

Fujin gave her a look of such contempt that Nicole couldn&#146;t help but 
laugh in her face.

&quot;It&#146;s hot in here.&quot; Nida muttered sourly.

&quot;What?&quot; Xu asked, looking up from a disemboweled control terminal.

&quot;The heat, did you turn it up?&quot; He explained.

&quot;Nope, there&#146;s probably a glitch in the system, things have been screwy 
ever since the shut down.

&quot;Well I&#146;m dying over here.&quot; He groaned, loosening the collar on his 
uniform.

&quot;Its sweltering in here.&quot; One of the other bridge crew grumbled as she 
walked past with a stack of papers.

&quot;See!&quot; Nida pointed.

&quot;What do you want me to do, I&#146;m not in charge of maintenance?&quot; She 
sighed, shoving her hand deep into the inner shell of the terminal she 
was working on. After a moment of feeling around she made a disgusted 
face and screamed.

&quot;What the heck?&quot; Nida yelped, jumping in surprise.

&quot;EW EW EW EW EW!&quot; XU babbled, yanking free of the terminal. Her hand was 
covered in a pasty red sludge, that was full of bits of fur and what 
looked like yellowish chunks of marshmallows.

&quot;GROSS!&quot; The bridge hand yelped covering her mouth and nose with her 
hands.

&quot;Get it off, get it off!&quot; Xu proclaimed in a near panic, waving her arm 
and running in place franticly.

&quot;What the hell is that!&quot; Nida winced, approaching cautiously. &quot;Are you 
okay?&quot;

&quot;Yes, oh Hyne it stinks!&quot; Xu wined, slinging her hand wildly.

Nida jumped back as chunks of the mess flew in his direction.

The smell spread and soon bridge hand turned a foul shade of green 
before retching noisily in a corner.

&quot;Aw damn it.&quot; Nida frowned in disgust. Xu, long past reason, ran to the 
elevator and left him standing on the bridge amid the growing stench.

 

&quot;You swim like a fish.&quot; Nicole grinned, sipping a monstrously sized 
glass of fruit punch. Fujin hauled herself out of the water and shook 
the water from her hair. Nicole sighed in annoyance as Fujin strode over 
to her. Solid and well toned, she was in wonderful shape, the product of 
a strict diet and exercise. While in good shape herself, Nicole couldn&#146;t 
help but be slightly envious, but she knew she just wasn&#146;t cut out for 
weightlifting and cross-country training.

&quot;I hate you.&quot; She huffed jokingly as Fujin sat down beside her.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin frowned.

&quot;Nothing.&quot; Nicole grinned. &quot;Just hating myself for not getting more 
exercise. I dunno perhaps I&#146;ll start training with Zell in the 
mornings.&quot;

&quot;WHY?&quot;

&quot;I dunno, all of you are like, in prefect shape and I&#146;m just like, hey, 
hi there, here I am, normal ole Nicole.&quot; She sighed, throwing her hands 
into the air. Lying back in her lawn chair Fujin rolled her eye.

&quot;FOOLISH.&quot; She grunted simply.

&quot;Easy for you to say, you&#146;re ass doesn&#146;t shake when you walk.&quot;

Fujin choked, caught utterly off guard by the comment.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; She wheezed, taking a sip of her drink.

&quot;Oh never mind.&quot; Nicole sighed, shaking her head.

&quot;VERY WELL.&quot; Fujin shrugged.

&quot;I think I need to change my image.&quot; Nicole continued.

Fujin sighed, and looked at her out of the corner of her eye.

&quot;What do you think, perhaps a hair cut. I could dye it, go blonde 
perhaps?&quot;

&quot;HIDEOUS.&quot; Fujin grunted.

&quot;Gee thanks.&quot; Nicole frowned.

&quot;NOT YOU.&quot; Fujin sighed, sitting back up and pointing towards the 
entrance of the pool house. Celest was walking towards them in what 
appeared to be a yellow and green muumuu; the billowing garment hung 
from her figure in such an unflattering way as to make her look well 
overweight. To top the ridiculous outfit off she wore a gaudy looking 
wide brimmed sun hat that and sunglasses.

&quot;Oh my...&quot; Nicole murmured, her eyes widening.

&quot;HA.&quot; Fujin huffed, before lying back down.

&quot;Hi...&quot; Celest grumbled.

&quot;Um...&quot; Nicole stammered. &quot;Celest hon...&quot; She giggled. &quot;You um...okay?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; The redhead sighed, taking a seat in an unoccupied chair.

&quot;EXPLAIN SUIT.&quot; Fujin said bluntly, knowing Nicole would take forever to 
ask.

&quot;I figured its time I started dressing down.&quot; Celest shrugged.

&quot;Aw geeze.&quot; Nicole sighed. &quot;I think you may be overdoing it a bit...&quot; 
She said gently. Celest frowned and folded her arms in aggravation.

&quot;What&#146;s that supposed to mean?&quot;

&quot;OLD LADY CLOTHES.&quot; Fujin commented, not even raising up to face them.

&quot;You stay out of this.&quot; Nicole scowled. Fujin shrugged, and slipped on a 
pair of shades. The skylight was open and the sun was furiously bright, 
to the point of being painful to her delicate vision.

&quot;Celest...that suit, if that&#146;s what you call it, is not flattering in 
the least.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s the point.&quot; Celest frowned.

&quot;This is just ridiculous and you know it.&quot; Nicole growled, wagging a 
finger at her. &quot;Where&#146;d you even find that hideous thing.&quot;

&quot;I can&#146;t believe you actually walked down her in that thing.&quot; Irvine 
laughed, as he ran by and leapt into the air.

&quot;Gangway!&quot; Zell added as he followed.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Fujin blurted, sitting up just as the two men hit the water with 
titanic splash. The ensuing mountain of water drenched the three women.

&quot;Asshole!&quot; Celest sputtered from under her soggy hat.

&quot;Boys.&quot; Nicole sighed, grabbing a towel to dry off.&quot;

&quot;Celest, what&#146;s with the tent?&quot; Zell shouted laughingly. Celest simply 
gave him the finger as Irvine shoved him underwater.

&quot;They seem to be in a good mood.&quot; Nicole grinned.

&quot;Where&#146;s the others?&quot; Celest asked, ditching the hat sourly.

&quot;They&#146;re taking Kevin and the others home.&quot;

&quot;Good riddance.&quot; Celest mumbled.

&quot;Hey I thought you liked the guy?&quot; Zell asked, swimming over to the 
edge.

&quot;Don&#146;t ask.&quot; Irvine warned him quietly.

&quot;You thought wrong!&quot; Celest snapped irritably.

Fujin meanwhile quietly got up and moved to search for place more in the 
shade.

&quot;Where ya going?&quot; Zell called to her. &quot;Didn&#146;t mean to chase you off.&quot;

&quot;SUN.&quot; Fujin answered simply, finding a nice spot to lounge.

&quot;There you guys are!&quot; Xu shouted, storming over to the gathering. Irvine 
and Zell ducked into the water, having no desire to get yanked back to 
work.

&quot;Oh she&#146;s on the warpath.&quot; Nicole mumbled quietly.

&quot;Where&#146;s Squall or Quistis? Neither of them have answered my calls we&#146;ve 
got a situation.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Celest asked worriedly.

&quot;Something has been mucking around...&quot; Xu started then stared at her 
blankly. &quot;What the hell are you wearing.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s a muumuu.&quot; Zell chirped, from the edge of the pool.

&quot;Rinoa said that Squall&#146;s not feeling well and Quistis went with Selphie 
to take Kevin and the gang back to Timber.&quot; Nicole explained.

&quot;Great, well then, you three can help out then.&quot; Xu smiled.

&quot;But I&#146;m off today.&quot; Celest pouted.

&quot;Hey we just got off duty.&quot; Zell protested.

&quot;Tough&quot; Xu scowled. &quot;Since Quistis isn&#146;t here I&#146;m in charge.&quot;

&quot;Tyrant.&quot; Irvine grumbled.

Fujin was thankful to be hidden out of site, she had a feeling that 
whatever Xu was upset about wouldn&#146;t be pleasant.

 

The trip back from Timber was a quiet one. Selphie was intent on flying 
and Rinoa had not said one word to Quistis during the entire flight. 
Finally, unable to take anymore Quistis leaned over to her and frowned 
slightly.

&quot;Something the matter.&quot; She asked bluntly.

&quot;Nope.&quot; Rinoa shrugged.

&quot;You&#146;re never this quiet.&quot; Quistis continued.

&quot;I am to.&quot; Rinoa countered.

&quot;Don&#146;t give me that. You forget, I know people.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s nothing.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re still upset about Fujin and me aren&#146;t you?&quot;

&quot;Not really...&quot;

&quot;Yes you are...&quot; Quistis sighed sadly.

&quot;Well a little. You have to admit Quisty, this is big, ya know. I mean, 
its like we never knew the real you.&quot;

&quot;Rinoa, nothing has changed, I&#146;m still the same Quistis you knew 
before.&quot;

&quot;You weren&#146;t dating a woman then.&quot; Rinoa replied with an edgy bluntness.

&quot;Hey no fair gossiping without me!&quot; Selphie shouted over her shoulder.

&quot;No ones gossiping!&quot; Quistis shot back sourly before looking back at 
Rinoa.

&quot;Look, this is only as difficult as you make it.&quot;

&quot;Easy for you to say.&quot; Rinoa frowned.

&quot;What do you want me to do, stopping seeing her? Because if that&#146;s what 
you expect, then I have some frightening news for you.&quot; Quistis glared.

&quot;No, it&#146;s not like that.&quot; Rinoa cried in frustration.

&quot;Then tell me?&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t know.&quot; Rinoa sighed, sitting back in her seat heavily. &quot;Things 
are different now, I&#146;m not used to stuff like this.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s called life hon, you&#146;re going to have to learn to deal with the 
unexpected, because if you don&#146;t, it&#146;ll will roll right over you.&quot;

&quot;I just don&#146;t understand...&quot; Rinoa said quietly.

&quot;Then don&#146;t try hon, just be happy for me.&quot; Quistis smiled, taking her 
hand in hers.

 

&quot;Dude this sucks!&quot; Zell whined.

&quot;You think.&quot; Celest scowled, holding up a slime covered computer board.

&quot;Xu, what the hell is this crap.&quot; Irvine scowled in disgust.

&quot;I don&#146;t know.&quot; Xu growled, as she sat on the floor with a bottle of 
cleaning solution and a bucket.

&quot;Why are we doing this, why can&#146;t we get maintenance or some students to 
do this.&quot; Celest complained.

&quot;Because, the students wouldn&#146;t know how to handle some of this 
equipment. As for maintenance, they&#146;re down with the other SEED&#146;s 
cleaning up that stink you found this morning.

&quot;Wonderful.&quot; Zell groaned.

&quot;Yup, here&#146;s some more.&quot; Nida announced, pulling another computer panel 
free. Like all the others it was covered in a thick foul smelling 
sludge.

&quot;What the hell is this crap?&quot; Zell barked, getting fed up.

&quot;Doc says its some kind by-product, the hair came from rodents that got 
caught up in it.&quot;

&quot;GROSS!&quot; Celest screeched.

&quot;By product of what!?&quot; Irvine gagged.

&quot;She thinks it may be from some kind of slug.&quot; Xu explained as she 
carefully cleaned yet another panel.

&quot;You&#146;d think this gunk would short something out.&quot; Nida noted.

&quot;Just be lucky it didn&#146;t. But it can&#146;t be good for the works. I bet this 
crap is why some of the systems have been running weird.&quot; Zell offered.

&quot;I don&#146;t care, I just want a shower.&quot; Celest cried.

&quot;Welcome to SEED.&quot; Irvine chuckled; catching himself as he almost wiped 
his brow with a goo covered hand.

&quot;Slugs...this is great...&quot; Zell groused. &quot;They better not be in my 
ship.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re ship?&quot; Xu grinned.

The bridge door slid open and Squall walked in with a somewhat sullen 
expression. He was considerably shocked to find half his senior staff 
tearing the guts out of the bridge.

&quot;What the?&quot; He mouthed quietly.

&quot;Hey boss.&quot; Zell waved at him with a slime-covered hand.

&quot;Can I go home now.&quot; Celest whimpered.

&quot;But this is when it gets fun.&quot; Irvine chuckled.

&quot;Look at this.&quot; Xu blurted, striding up to him with soap covered hands.

Squall took a step back and looked around.

&quot;Something crawled into the computer system and took a dump.&quot; Zell 
explained.

&quot;You&#146;re joking.&quot; Squall frowned, noticing the stench in the air.

&quot;I wish we were.&quot; Celest cried.

&quot;Do we know what did it?&quot; Squall asked, looking over Nida&#146;s shoulder.

&quot;Nope, though doc thinks it was some kind of slug infestation.&quot; Xu 
answered albeit skeptically.

&quot;A slug?&quot; Squall scowled, taking a closer look at this mess. &quot;Hyne... 
how many? I don&#146;t know sounds odd to me, what kind of slug roots around 
in electronics?&quot; He mumbled.

&quot;Beats me man, I only work here.&quot; Zell chuckled.

&quot;Shut up.&quot; Xu groaned.

&quot;That mess isn&#146;t poisonous is it.&quot; Squall asked, causing everyone to 
pause.

&quot;Um well.&quot; Nida blanched.

&quot;Poisonous!?&quot; Celest squeaked.

&quot;Tell me, you checked.&quot; Squall groaned.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Xu sighed, rolling her eyes at everyone&#146;s paranoia. Doctor 
Kadowaki said it&#146;s little more than a gelled mucus like substance, its 
disgusting but harmless.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#146;t need to hear that.&quot; Celest gurgled.

&quot;Feelin better boss?&quot; Zell asked brightly.

&quot;Fine.&quot; Squall answered dryly before squatting next to Xu and grabbing a 
slop covered panel. &quot;Where&#146;s the girls?&quot;

&quot;What are we, chopped liver.&quot; Xu frowned, nodding towards Celest.

&quot;Don&#146;t be difficult.&quot; Squall sighed.

&quot;They flew out to Timber with Selphie to take Watts and the guys home.&quot; 
She explained.

&quot;They should be back soon, Nicole said they left a good while ago.&quot; Zell 
added.

The sound of the elevator humming announced someone&#146;s approach. A moment 
later the door opened and Cid walked out onto the bridge with a frown. 
What ever you all are doing, I can smell it down in my office.&quot; He 
grumbled then put a hand over his mouth. &quot;What are you doing, 
slaughtering animals?&quot;

&quot;I was just finding out.&quot; Squall said with a frown.

 

&quot;Where is everyone?&quot; Selphie frowned as she made her way out to the 
pool.

&quot;Good question?&quot; Quistis frowned.

&quot;Over here guys.&quot; Nicole waved from the shadowed area where she and 
Fujin sat playing cards.

&quot;I thought everyone was meeting us?&quot; Rinoa asked, looking around. Except 
for a few students doing laps, the pool was mostly vacant.

&quot;CLEANUP DUTY.&quot; Fujin said, counting out a pile of peanuts and setting 
them at the center of the table.

&quot;What?&quot; Quistis asked as everyone pulled up a seat.

&quot;Xu came in and drug em all off.&quot; Nicole shrugged. &quot;Apparently something 
died up inside one of the computers on the bridge, they&#146;re all trying to 
clean it out.&quot;

&quot;Gross.&quot; Selphie winced. &quot;What was it?&quot;

&quot;UNKNOWN.&quot; Fujin said, waiting for Nicole to place her bet.

&quot;Me and Fujin been playing cards ever since.&quot; Nicole grinned, tossing in 
her bet and showing her cards.

&quot;DAMN.&quot; Fujin grumbled, setting hers down in a huff.

&quot;You&#146;d think she of all people could play poker.&quot; Nicole giggled, eating 
one of the nuts.

&quot;CHEAT.&quot; Fujin huffed, folding her arms.

&quot;Don&#146;t be a sore loser, it&#146;s not becoming.&quot; Quistis grinned, leaning 
against her companionably.

&quot;Well what do we do now?&quot; Selphie asked in a somewhat bored tone.

&quot;I don&#146;t know.&quot; Rinoa sighed heavily.

&quot;Come now, surely we can think of something.&quot; Nicole grinned.

&quot;Hey it&#146;ll be like old times, just the four of us.&quot; Selphie giggled then 
blushed; noting the look Fujin was giving her. &quot;Plus one.&quot; She added 
gingerly. &quot;I bet we can get into trouble if we put our heads together.&quot;

Quistis looked worried and that did little to help Fujin&#39;s growing sense 
of dread.</pre>
