The sending spell Edea used on the Griever&#39;s dark forces left her 
weakened. Feeling faint, she staggered backwards. Thankfully Irvine was 
within arms reach and caught her.

&quot;Easy Ma&#39;am, I have that effect on a lot of ladies.&quot; He smirked, holding 
her steady.

&quot;It is done.&quot; She whispered.

Xu ran up to them with a look of utter frustration.

&quot;What in the hell is going on out here, is it so much to ask that I be 
kept informed!&quot; She shouted, tired of being left out.

&quot;Not now. Take care of the recruits!&quot; Squall shouted, running towards 
the Ragnarok with Rinoa, and Royce hot on his heels.

&quot;Wait! I&#39;m going too!&quot; Irvine yelled after them.

&quot;I must go also.&quot; Edea said weakly.

&quot;Alright then.&quot; He nodded, scooping her into his arms. &quot;Sorry if I seem 
forward. I usually get to know a lady before I sweep her off her feet.&quot; 
He smiled dashing.

Edea smiled quaintly as he paused to check on Selphie. She was sitting 
down exhausted and drinking from a borrowed canteen.

&quot;Go on you big lug. But you better be back soon.&quot; She warned him before 
waving him on.

**********************

Quistis crawled over to Fujin and caressed her cheek tenderly. &quot;Fujin?&quot; 
She whimpered fearfully at the sight of her. Bleeding profusely from her 
mouth, ears and nose it was obvious she was hurt badly. Griever has 
destroyed her links to her guardians leaving her without any spells. 
Refusing to give up hope she tenderly she rested her hands on Fujin&#39;s 
brow and closed her eyes. Having no other options she was forced to rely 
on the unpredictable power of her blue magic. The power was difficult to 
control but she would not be denied. An aura of white light engulfed her 
a brief moment before flowing slowly into Fujin. Quistis struggled to 
keep focused as the magic mended the horrible damage Griever has caused. 
After a few moments Fujin slowly opened her eye and looked about in 
confusion. With a small shout of joy Quistis collapsed atop her, hugging 
her tightly. Fujin had no idea what happened, the last thing she 
recalled was breaking Griever neck.

&quot;WHAT HAPPENED?&quot; She groaned as Quistis released her.

&quot;You tried to give me a heart attack.&quot; She laughed raising back up.

&quot;ASPRIN.&quot; Fujin grunted sourly. She tried to sit up but the motion made 
her want to vomit so she settled on lying still for a while.

&quot;Thank Hyne you&#39;re alright.&quot; Quistis smiled warmly.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t you gals worry about me, I&#39;m fine here, thanks.&quot; Zell grumbled 
sarcastically, limping towards them. Quistis stood and hugged him 
tightly causing him to wince. Quistis helped him sit down and pointed to 
the twitching mass underneath the Ragnarok&#39;s foot.

&quot;Thanks Zell, that was fast thinking.&quot; She said proudly.

&quot;Wasn&#39;t me.&quot; He admitted, looking up at ship in bewilderment.

&quot;AEKA!&quot; Fujin gasped abruptly, forcing herself to her feet.

&quot;Oh no!&quot; Quistis cried out looking towards the pit in dismay. She tried 
her headset but it had been ruined in the fight with Griever. Spinning 
around she gestured to Zell desperately. &quot;Get us ready for dust off&quot;

&quot;Right away!&quot; He shouted and started up the loading ramp.

&quot;HURRY.&quot; Fujin grunted as Quistis helped her to her feet.

A loud hiss issued from Griever&#39;s remains and all three of them froze in 
horror as dark cloud rose from under the Ragnarok&#39;s talon. Coiling in 
upon itself as if alive the foggy mass formed a vaguely bestial 
countenance and roared silently at them.

&quot;Aw, what in the hell?&quot; Zell said taking a step back.

&quot;It&#39;s Griever&#39;s true form.&quot; Seifer said simply, stepping out of the 
darkness, he turned a curious gaze towards the cloud and started towards 
purposefully, with ominous glint in his eye.

&quot;What are you doing!&quot; Zell shouted running over to him. Seifer wasted no 
time and punched him viciously in the gut. Unlike Zell, Seifer was 
unhurt and had the full power of his Guardian&#39;s at his disposal. There 
was little doubt to outcome and Zell collapsed to the ground 
unconscious.

&quot;KILL YOU.&quot; Fujin snarled lunging forward.

&quot;No Fujin, stop!&quot; Quistis held her back; knowing neither of them was in 
any shape to stand up to him.

&quot;TRUE FACE, DEVIL, COWARD!&quot; Fujin raved. Seifer watched her 
expressionlessly as she cursed him with a relentless fervor.

&quot;Cute real cute, you two make a fine couple.&quot; Seifer sneered, gazing at 
them with disgust as he knelt by Griever. The black cloud was already 
beginning to fade as it looked on with growing interest.

&quot;You&#39;re angry aren&#39;t you.&quot; Seifer said quietly, touching the cloud 
tenderly.

&quot;I know all about you. Cast out, abandoned, hated by your peers, and 
feared by everyone else.&quot; He sighed sadly. &quot;It&#39;s a horrible situation to 
be in. Rest assured though.&quot; He said thoughtfully looking at Fujin. &quot;I 
know how you feel.&quot;

The cloud darkened and the monstrous face within smiled wickedly.

&quot;He&#39;s going to bond with it!&quot; Quistis shouted in alarm, starting towards 
him.

&quot;SEIFER NO!&quot; Fujin screamed. &quot;MADNESS!&quot;

&quot;Oh look, now she calls out to me. Now, when it&#39;s to late.&quot; Seifer 
grinned, giving her an embittered look.

&quot;This won&#39;t change anything Seifer. Don&#39;t do it! What happened to you 
wanting to make things right. You&#39;ll destroy everything you worked for!&quot; 
Quistis pleaded.

&quot;Well now Instructor Trepe, we all know we can&#39;t always have what we 
want. Besides I&#39;ve nothing to lose anyway.&quot; Seifer laughed. &quot;But with 
this, perhaps I can finally find what I&#39;ve been looking for.&quot; He said 
with a quiet finality.

&quot;SEIFER.&quot; Fujin groaned wearily, she was tired, tired of the arguing, 
the hatred. Tired of the fear and constant grief.

&quot;To late, you had you&#39;re chance.&quot; Seifer scowled turning his back to 
then and looking to Griever with wide eager eyes. &quot;Come to me, I give 
myself to you, together we can change the world.&quot; He said with an eager 
smile. Griever roared with delight and enveloped him. The demon cloud 
swirled around him, lifting him off the ground. Seifer screamed in agony 
as the dark mist made its way into his eyes and mouth before dropping 
him to the ground.

Fujin set her jaw and prepared for the worst as Quistis drew her whip. 
Both knew with grim certainty that they had no chance to stand against 
him.

Squall, Rinoa and Royce arrived on the scene. The first thing Squall saw 
was the moldering remains crushed under the Ragnarok&#39;s foot and blinked 
uncomprehendingly. Slowly he moved towards Quistis and Fujin with a look 
of shock. &quot;You killed it!&quot; He said in surprise before noticing Zell 
laying face down in the dirt. &quot;Zell?&quot; He shouted, quickly moving towards 
his friend. &quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;Oh no.&quot; Rinoa cried out rushing to help.

&quot;BEWARE!&quot; Fujin shouted.

&quot;Seifer bonded with Griever!&quot; Quistis screamed as Seifer began to stand. 
Steam was rolling off his back as blue sparks arced off him as he slowly 
he turned to face them.

&quot;BASTARD!&quot; Squall roared while drawing his gunblade.

Seifer shook his head &quot;If you could see your face.&quot; He laughed.

Squall scowled and moved forward with every intention of ending Seifer&#39;s 
life.

Seifer smiled belligerently and the area around Squall shimmered briefly 
before he was lifted off the ground, then thrown violently backwards. He 
slammed into Rinoa knocking her over, his gunblade flying from his hand.

Seifer lifted off the ground and floated towards him smiling broadly. He 
was about to speak when an audible click made him pause. Fujin stood 
behind him with a hardened look in her eyes. In her hand she held 
Squall&#39;s gunblade, the tip of it pointing at the base of Seifer&#39;s skull 
as her finger rested on the trigger.

&quot;Wait!&quot; Edea shouted as she and Irvine arrived. Fujin arched a wary brow 
but kept her eye firmly on Seifer.

&quot;Seifer?&quot; Edea called out cautiously.

&quot;Matron.&quot; Seifer responded smoothly glancing at her from the corner of 
his eye. &quot;I&#39;m glad you here, everyone was getting tense.&quot; He said with a 
sly grin.

&quot;What happens now?&quot; She asked worriedly, her eyes darting as she tried 
to read him. Seifer took a breath and sighed slightly.

&quot;I can hold him, for a time. You were right, he fell for it.&quot; He finally 
said, his voice shaky.

Edea closed her eyes and relaxed visibly. Seifer slowly turned around, 
smiling impishly.

&quot;Fujin, it&#39;s cool. You want to put the gun down before you do something 
we&#39;ll both regret?&quot; He said slowly. Fujin said nothing and stared at him 
chillingly.

&quot;Seifer&#39;s right child, it is over.&quot; Edea said warmly.

&quot;Stay there Fujin.&quot; Squall ordered glaring hotly at Edea. &quot;This was your 
plan, that&#146;s insane, we can&#39;t leave Griever with him?!&quot; He shouted.

&quot;Yes, but I shall explain in due time, now though I fear we must hurry.&quot; 
Edea sighed moving towards Seifer.

&quot;We&#39;re not going anywhere until I know what you&#39;ve done!&quot; Squall 
demanded.

&quot;Cid has made the preparations.&quot; Edea explained.

Squall exploded. &quot;I don&#39;t give a damn! I want answers right now or I 
have Fujin blow his head off.&quot; He snarled, nodding toward Fujin who 
tensed but was more than ready to do so. Quistis felt ill, the situation 
was far too tense. Royce stood by quietly but it was obvious he was 
anxious to find Aeka. Quistis could only hope she was still alive.

&quot;We&#39;ve have made arrangements to contain Griever in Esthar.&quot; Edea said 
firmly, to explain in more detail would waste precious time. We still 
need to find the missing recruit and get Seifer back to Balamb.

&quot;What?&quot; Rinoa murmured, looking Seifer in dismay.

&quot;Looks like I don&#39;t have to worry about a trial.&quot; Seifer chuckled 
softly, giving her a wink. Squall looked ready to go mad and threw his 
hands into the air in frustration. &quot;Fine!&quot; He finally relented. &quot;But so 
help me, if all this is some kind of trick.&quot; He hissed before nodding to 
Fujin. Seifer looked slightly worried look as she kept the weapon aimed 
at him a moment longer before finally lowering it.

&quot;Sorry about all of this.&quot; He said with a smirk.

Fujin shrugged then smashed him in the face with the hilt of the 
Gunblade, knocking him out cold.

&quot;Fujin!&quot; Quistis shouted in shock. Squall looked down quietly at Seifer 
then to Fujin seeking answers.

&quot;UNCONSCIOUS, NO GRIEVER.&quot; She explained simply before tossing him the 
weapon. Edea was distraught, she hadn&#39;t meant to upset Squall so, and 
hoped the damage was not irrevocable. She turned to Irvine who stood 
quietly by her.

&quot;Help me with him?&quot; She asked quietly, motioning to Seifer.

&quot;Of course.&quot; Irvine smiled sympathetically.

With the situation finally under control everyone began preparing for 
the next plan of action. Rinoa knelt by Zell to tend his wounds as 
Quistis and Royce talked with Squall about find Aeka. Fujin meanwhile, 
stood quietly away from everyone lost in thought.

**************************

&quot;I&#39;m afraid of the dark. It&#39;s cold and unfeeling, the epitome of 
nothingness. I&#39;m afraid of the silence, the silence of being alone, like 
death, eternal solitude. I am a coward I know, but I can&#39;t help it, it 
is how I am. How long have I been here, hours, days, even years? I guess 
it doesn&#39;t matter, time has no meaning here, in the darkness, in my 
tomb. I&#39;m so sorry, I tried I really did but I guess everyone was right 
about me. I was weak and now look at me. I call for my mother, hoping 
she can save me. Futile I know, especially since I hardly knew her, but 
I guess its just instinct. How I wish I was brave enough to tell you how 
I feel. I always loved you. You&#39;re perfect, handsome, kind, brave, 
smart, and funny. You made me laugh; I remember all the times you would 
do things to cheer me up when I was down. I wish you were here, to hold 
me, to keep me warm. It&#39;s so cold, and I&#39;m so tired. Where are you, do 
you hate me? You promised you&#39;d save me. I don&#39;t want to be alone, 
please. I&#39;m afraid of the dark.&quot;

************************

Zell and Quistis had quickly figured out Aeka&#39;s location and the 
Ragnarok was already carefully plowing through the thick layers of stone 
and concrete. Fujin and Squall stood on the ground watching carefully 
for any sign of the girl. Nearby, the other students had gathered along 
parameter watching eagerly. Inside the Ragnarok&#39;s hold, Edea and Rinoa 
tended to Seifer, he&#39;d been chained to a seat even though he was still 
unconscious. Squall had demanded the precaution before agreeing to let 
him aboard the ship. Irvine and Selphie sat together in a darkened 
corner holding each quietly as they reflected on the night&#39;s events. 
Celest stood with Royce, quietly being there for him. He looked haggard, 
and seemed aged, no longer had the youthful glow that he&#39;d had just 
hours earlier.

Squall held up his arm sharply and the Ragnarok pulled back as he and 
Fujin slipped into the hole. Using his gunblade as a lever, he pried a 
large section of concrete up so that Fujin could get her hands under it. 
Moving the slab she could see Aeka laying motionless a few feet below 
wedged between to large sections of concrete. Stepping back she summoned 
Pandemonia, with a crack of thunder the guardian force appeared in the 
sky above and knew instinctively what Fujin wanted. Raising its arms 
into the air the summoned creature called forth a howling wind. The 
hurricane winds seemed erratic but were under complete and precise 
control. Slowly pieces of debris began floating into the air. The winds 
increased further and Fujin and Squall were forced to step back as the 
Guardian did its work. Immense sections of concrete floated weightless 
out of the hole before being slung far into the distant.

Finally a small figure rose out of the debris, gently cradled by a 
cushion of air. Pandemonia descended and caught Aeka carefully in its 
hand. Moving respectfully the guardian force laid her down at Fujin&#39;s 
feet then vanished in swirl of dust. With trembling hands Fujin knelt by 
her bruised and broken form. Her heart sank as she realized that it was 
too late. Aeka&#39;s once smiling face was now a frozen mask of fear. Tears 
stained her lifeless cheeks and she appeared caught in a nightmare, from 
which she&#39;d never awaken. Choking back tears Fujin gently rested Aeka&#39;s 
head in her lap and caressed her hair tenderly.

&quot;I am sorry.&quot; She murmured, gently rocking back and forth.

Squall looked down at the two quietly and sighed. At a loss, he shook 
his head in sorrow and made his way back to the Ragnarok. Quistis and 
Royce rushed to the scene and paused when Fujin looked up at them, her 
face taunt as tears flowed down her cheeks.

&quot;NO!&quot; Royce screamed hoarsely. Running forward, he roughly shoved Fujin 
away and clutched Aeka to him. Fujin slowly stood and looked at him 
sympathetically.

&quot;She just needs her rest.&quot; He muttered, quietly clutching her to him. 
&quot;She&#39;ll be okay, I know she will.&quot; He said weakly, his whole body 
shaking as emotion overtook him. Fujin put a comforting hand on his 
shoulder but he was oblivious. Turning her head saw Quistis. She stood 
stoic, her expression grim and haunted, only the slight tremble in her 
features gave any sign of the turmoil within. Sensing Quistis&#39;s pain 
Fujin went to her.

&quot;I told her we&#39;d save her.&quot; Quistis said quietly, her voice quivering.

Fujin frowned sadly and moved to hug her but Quistis ignored the gesture 
and moved past as if in a trance. Fujin looked to her in dismay but kept 
silent. With a heavy sigh she wiped away her tears and walked slowly to 
the gathering of students to tell them the grim news.

*****************

As Squall made his way inside the Ragnarok Rinoa looked up hopefully, 
but her hope vanished upon seeing the look on his face.

&quot;Oh no!&quot; She gasped.

Edea nodded knowingly and sighed.

&quot;We were to late.&quot; Squall said in quiet anger, then slung his gunblade 
wildly. The weapon slammed against the hull with loud clang, causing 
Rinoa to jump. She ran to him and threw her arms around him with a sob.

&quot;I want to go home.&quot; He said quietly.

************

Outside, thing had gotten bad, Aeka&#39;s classmates had gathered around 
Royce and Quistis&#39;s as they stood over the body of their fallen comrade. 
Royce was enraged beyond reason and screamed at the instructor with 
tears in his eyes.

&quot;This is your fault! You shouldn&#39;t have let her come!&quot; He screamed 
angrily, shoving her backwards. &quot;You, killed her! You did! You shouldn&#39;t 
have let her come! Why?!&quot; Quistis didn&#39;t respond nor did she fight back 
as he flailed against her feebly. Fujin however, did. Snarling she 
grabbed the youth by the wrist and slung him to the ground harshly.

&quot;STOP THIS&quot; She screamed striding towards him. Celest intercepted her 
and stood between the two.

&quot;Both of you stop, this isn&#39;t going to change anything. You think she&#39;d 
want her friends fighting like this.&quot; She shouted sadly.

&quot;He is right.&quot; Quistis said stiffly.

&quot;What?&quot; Celest frowned.

Fujin spun around with a look of disappointment.

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot; She said in anger.

&quot;No, it&#39;s true, I should have failed her, she just wasn&#39;t strong 
enough.&quot; Quistis said regretfully.

Fujin looked utterly shocked and betrayed.

&quot;HOW, COULD YOU SAY THAT!?&quot; She blurted, pointing to Aeka grimly.

&quot;STRONG!&quot; She cried out sadly. &quot;FOUGHT HARD!&quot; She knew Aeka deserved to 
be a SEED and to hear Quistis say such a thing was painful. But she knew 
where this was coming from, Quistis was blaming herself for Aeka&#39;s death 
and Royce was lashing out from grief. Two reactions Fujin knew well, 
she&#39;d done the same thing upon her mother&#39;s death. Quistis only stared 
back at her silently, her expression haggard and broken. Zell made his 
way through the whispering crowd and stood a moment as Fujin and Quistis 
faced each other.

&quot;It&#39;s time to go.&quot; He said quietly.

&quot;Hon, it&#39;s over lets take her home.&quot; Celest whispered to Fujin who stood 
trembling.

Royce gently lifted Aeka off the ground, stopping briefly he looked 
bitterly at Quistis before trudging to the Ragnarok. One by one the 
recruits boarded the ship, leaving only Quistis and Fujin behind.

&quot;I failed her.&quot; Quistis murmured.

&quot;NO.&quot; Fujin said sadly.

&quot;She died, frightened and alone, she deserved better.&quot;

&quot;I KNOW.&quot;

The two grew silent for a few moments, watching the sun begin rise on 
the horizon

&quot;Was it worth it?&quot; Quistis asked finally with a heavy sigh.

&quot;IS IT EVER?&quot; Fujin answered simply then headed towards the waiting 
Ragnarok, leaving Quistis alone with her thoughts.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She whispered softly then quietly followed her.</pre>
