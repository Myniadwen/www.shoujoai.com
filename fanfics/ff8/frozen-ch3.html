Her head struck the earth with a resounding thud making her see stars. She tasted blood on 
her lips immediately and soon the metallic tang of adrenaline joined it. She was roughly 
pulled to her feet then hoisted into the air by powerful arms.

&quot;Damn it.&quot; She cursed to herself for being careless. She couldn&#39;t see a thing, a huge hand 
covered her face and the other wrapped around her shoulders pinning her arms. She focused 
and remained calm. Quickly making a plan of actions when rude hands suddenly assaulted her. 
A second assailant she noted angrily as the roving hands groped hungrily over her breasts 
and thighs.

&quot;Whoa man! I thought you said you was going to scare her!&quot; The one holding her said warily.

&quot;She&#39;s looks scared to me.&quot; The other voiced gruffly.

This was getting interesting, but she had stood for enough. She sank her teeth clean 
through the meaty palm across her face. A bellow of pain rang out and she relished it 
moment before slamming her head back with all her strength. Her skull connected with and 
crushed cartilage causing another scream. She was promptly dropped and the moment she hit 
the ground a fist slammed into her jaw. The blow sen her spiraling. She rolled into a 
crouch snarling. Her gaze locked on her attackers. She saw two of them one danced about 
holding his ruined nose, his right hand dripping blood like a spigot. The other stood ready 
and moved towards her. It was the idiot from the Disciplinary Committee, Luccian she 
believed his name was.

&quot;IDIOT!&quot; She shouted.

&quot;Your mine, bitch!&quot; He sneered and leaped at her.

&quot;NO CHANCE.&quot; She laughed sharply. A complete rookie, she noted as she ducked under his 
awkward lunge. She drove her fist up into his midsection. His eyes bulged and he coughed 
harshly as her fell over her shoulder his weight nearly taking her with him.

&quot;FIRGAS!&quot; She quickly shouted causing the hand still on his stomach to glow an angry 
crimson. Her fist exploded into a fiery burst that sent him flying high. He tumbled through 
the air like a wayward missile and crashed into the bushes a several feet away.

Fujin stood and brushed the ash and soot from her shirt. She then flexed her scorched 
fingers, they still smoldered from the point blank burst. She looked up at the other man 
who stood motionless. His eyes where wide as saucers as he looked about contemplating 
retreat. She wiped the blood from her lips with her shirt hem. Once sufficiently cleaned up 
she walked up to him. He towered over her at least good two feet.

&quot;WELL?&quot; She asked simply.

&quot;Um what?&quot; He stammered, She was going to kill him he knew it.

&quot;THAT ALL?&quot;

&quot;Um What?&quot;

&quot;WANT MORE?&quot; She folder her arms.

&quot;No!&quot; He blurted. He then looked down ashamed. &quot;Sorry I didn&#39;t know he..&quot;

&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; She frowned at him almost sadly. He was probably only fifteen years old.

She shook her head in disgust then pointed to his bleeding hand.

&quot;GET STICHES.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re letting me go?&quot; He looked at her baffled.

&quot;NO HARM, JUST STUPID.&quot; She said as she walked into the bushes. She soon reappeared 
dragging a slightly charred Luccian by the collar. He groaned feebly as she dumped him into 
the clearing. He had a horrid burn on his stomach but he would live.

&quot;DOCTOR.&quot; She said and kicked Luccian in the head lightly.

&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am&quot; He knelt and carefully tossed his friend over his shoulder.

&quot;NAME?&quot;

&quot;Who me?&quot;

&quot;YES!&quot;

&quot;Archibald Ma&#39; am.&quot;

&quot;NOT AGAIN.&quot; She said calmly but with obvious deadly intent.

&quot;Never.&quot; He stammered.

&quot;GO!&quot; She tossed her head towards the garden.

He nodded and quickly took off.

Fujin shook her head and ruffled her hair. She actually felt better now although the 
groping nonsense was pointless and rude, that pissed her off more than anything. Fighting 
was one thing, she liked a challenge but she was not about to be manhandled like some toy. 
She popped her neck and rubbed her quickly bruising jaw. He did punch like a mule though 
she had to admit as she walked back to the garden.

Quistis walked up the hall loaded down with bags. It was nearly eight when they got back. 
Selphie went to her room in a tiff and called it a night so Nicole invited Quistis back to 
her place for some cards. Now it was nearly ten and she sorely wanted to get off her feet. 
All in all she had to admit she had a pretty good day. She yawned and fumbled for her keys 
as she rounded the corner near her apartment. She cursed sharply as she dropped them.

She shuffled the bags careful not to drop them as she attempted to pick them up, she failed 
miserably.

&quot;Oh for the love of!&quot; She managed before the bags slipped from her grasp and strewn them 
self in a circle about her feet. Various trinkets and rose shaped soaps rolled up the hall 
with rebellious fervor. A snow globe with singing children spiraled about crazily. She got 
on hands and knees to capture the fleeing debris. She reached for the snow globe and came 
face to face with a pair of fluffy white Mog faced slippers. She looked up slowly startled. 
Fujin stood above her looking down with a half-amused expression, she wore a loose black 
tank top with the garden&#39;s emblem on it with matching shorts. She noticed she smelled 
faintly of roses.

&quot;Um nice slippers.&quot; Quistis said with a careful grin.

Fujin just stood her expression unchanging. Quistis looked away and started gathering her 
things once more.

&quot;So much for levity.&quot; She mumbled under her breath.

&quot;I assume you came for you Jacket?&quot; She said, still not meeting the woman&#39;s gaze and 
feeling more and more like an imbecile.

Fujin nodded.

&quot;I had it cleaned.&quot; She stated as tactfully as she could.

&quot;It smelled like the party when I woke up.&quot; She had no desire to think about last night.

Silence was the only reply. Quistis just nodded gravely.

&quot;Great, she thinks I&#39;m retarded.&quot; She thought to herself.

Fujin knelt and started to picking up the scattered items. Quistis looked up genuinely 
surprised. Then frowned as she noticed Fujin&#39;s gauze wrapped hand and the angry bluish 
bruise along her jaw.

&quot;Thanks&quot; Quistis whispered softly, her expression softened with worry.

After a few quite moments they completed their task. Fujin picked up a few and stood. 
Quistis unlocked the door and carried her load inside. Fujin waited in the hall until she 
came back to get the other bags from her. Quistis quickly put the items up then hurried 
back out with a flat rectangular box.

&quot;Here you go.&quot; She smiled and handed it to Fujin.

&quot;Good as new.&quot;

Fujin took the box and tucked it under her arm.

&quot;THANKS.&quot; She said simply and turned to leave. Quistis was taken aback and looked after 
her. Fujin was just about to round the corner.

&quot;Fujin?&quot; Quistis called abruptly. The other woman paused but didn&#39;t turn around.

&quot;You um hungry?&quot; Quistis felt like a utter fool, but she felt the need to try. It was the 
least she could do.

&quot;I kinda got tired of cafeteria food and bought some things to make dinner. You&#39;re welcome 
to join me. There&#39;s more than enough to go around&quot;

Fujin remained still, causing Quistis to wring her hands nervously.

&quot;Run away idiot! You are making a complete ass of yourself. She hates you just let her go, 
quit trying to make up.&quot; Her subconscious screamed at her.

Fujin turned and walked back towards her. Quistis&#39;s eyes widened slowly, she wasn&#39;t sure if 
she was about to be attacked or what.

&quot;I ACCEPT.&quot; Fujin stated flatly.

&quot;What are you doing.&quot; She asked herself.

Quistis sighed with relief and smiled causing Fujin to arch an eyebrow.

&quot;Well come in then.&quot; Quistis said as she stepped aside. Fujin walked in and looked about.

&quot;Take a seat on the couch while I put these up.&quot;

Fujin sat down stiffly placing her hands in lap. She glanced at her wounded hand, though 
she had wrapped it gauze it was still throbbing lightly. She ignored it and looked to 
Quistis who was fluttering about in the small kitchen. She was putting various items on the 
shelves and in the tiny refrigerator, she turned and looked to her guest.

&quot;Want anything to drink?&quot; She called oddly cheery.

&quot;I have, hmm lets see. Water, milk, tea, juice, wine and soda.&quot;

&quot;WATER.&quot; Fujin stated as she noticed a group photo of Quistis and all her students 
including herself, her brother and Seifer. She allowed a faint smirk to cross her lips only 
to wince as her jaw screamed at her. She remembered when that picture was taken, just days 
before Squall and Seifer exchanged scars while training.

Quistis walked over and handed her a glass.

&quot;Here you go.&quot; Fujin took the glass and sipped silently. Quistis paused a moment then 
offered a quaint smile before heading back to the kitchen. Fujin watched her leave from 
under the cascade of her bangs. She felt out of place and awkward, she laid her class on 
the coffee table. She was getting agitated. She looked down at her feet, smiling mog eyes 
stared blankly back at her. She noticed she was tapping her foot slightly, a sure sign she 
was more unsettled than she would admit. She&#39;s invited to dinner by anyone before and she 
avoided social engagements like a plague.

&quot;Why am I here? What does she want from me? She&#39;s probably trying to trick me somehow.&quot; She 
played various situations out in her mind; it did not relax her at all.

She stole a glance to the kitchen to see Quistis busily slicing a assortment of vegetables.

&quot;Not a hint of danger there, I think you can relax.&quot; She noted to herself before taking 
another sip of water. She looked at a assortment of photos atop the entertainment center 
across from her. She saw one of Rinoa and Squall, Rinoa peeking over Squall&#39;s shoulder 
smiling brightly her arms around his waist. Even Squall had a slight smile something she 
never seen before. They looked happy she thought. A slight discomfort tickled her deep 
down. She paid no attention and looked to yet another photo. This one of that goof Zell and 
his lady friend, Nicole, Fujin believed her name was.

Zell had the woman swept off her feet and was kissing her like some sailor returning from a 
long war. She rolled her eye and found one of Selphie and Irvine both dress in full 
uniform. They stood holding hands and smiling brightly a number of medals hung from each of 
their chests. She found herself frowning as she glanced over the reaming picture, all of 
the smiling faces taunted her wickedly. She sighed deep and slow as she looked away. She 
stopped something caught her eye. She glanced again at Quistis who was hoping up and down 
trying to get something from the top of a cabinet. Fujin got up slowly, a dull ache coursed 
through her body. After two fights and her self-punishment at the gym, she felt like she 
was made of lead. She quietly moved to get a closer inspection of the pictures. There it 
was. One of pictures set amid the others on a simple stand. It was a small photo and it was 
of her.

She picked it up and studied it. Sure enough there she was and she remembered this day 
well. She stood under a tree outside the garden watching the sunset. She had a hand 
clenched over her heart and a letter in her other. Fujin frowned softly at the memory, she 
had just found the letter from Rajin, she remembered all he wrote was that he was searching 
for what he had lost and would not be back for sometime. Just days before they both had 
returned to the garden after Seifer&#39;s disappearance. She noticed how sad and small she 
looked in the photo, how alone. Fujin carefully returned the photo to its place. Quistis 
must have saw her and secretly took the photo, she didn&#39;t know how to feel about that. She 
felt a cold dull emptiness creep through her insides. She looked over her shoulder at her 
host who&#39;s back was turned and was preparing something that smelled like salmon. Fujin 
crept back to her seat and sat back down.

A few minutes passed and Quistis finally walked back into the living room. She was playing 
with the clip in her hair.

&quot;Okay that about does it.&quot; She said peaceably as she removed the clip and shook her hair 
out. Her golden locks fell softly about her shoulders. She kicked off her shoes and laid 
them by the door.

&quot;The foods still has a few minutes to cook. You don&#39;t care if I get a quick shower do you? 
I&#39;ve been out and about all day.&quot;

Fujin shrugged indifferent.

&quot;Thanks I will be fast. Umm I have some music in the entertainment center if you want to 
listen to anything while you wait.&quot;

Fujin nodded and settled back in her seat.

&quot;Okay then, I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; She said as she disappeared into her bedroom. Fujin sat 
still for a long moment, she begun to smell the cooking food wafting through the apartment. 
It smelled good she had to admit. She herself had zero cooking skills and could not recall 
when she had a real home cooked meal. Defiantly not after arriving at the garden so many 
years ago. She allowed herself to smirk at the weirdness of her present situation. Here she 
was in the home of her former enemy in the middle of her night and waiting for dinner.

&quot;This is ludicrous.&quot; She thought, There was a knock at the door. Fujin about jumped out of 
her seat. Quistis poked her head out bedroom door.

&quot;Fuu could you answer that, if its Rinoa tell her I&#39;m in the shower.&quot;

&quot;Fuu!? What the hell is Fuu??&quot; Quistis mentally screamed at herself, She gritted her teeth 
in horrified embarrassment and sunk back behind the door. Fujin unnerved by another knock 
did not even notice the cute take on her name.

Another knock and Fujin arose awkwardly she approached the door as if it where gallows. She 
reached out tentatively and paused. Another knock this time somewhat exasperated. Fujin 
kicked herself for being paranoid and just opened the door.

&quot;Hiya Quistis. Glad to see your back. How did your trip go? I know its late but Squall&#39;s 
still out at the training center and I got bored.&quot; Rinoa babbled and stopped abruptly. She 
balked and paled visibly she looked about like she wasn&#39;t sure where she was.

&quot;Fu..Fu..? Fujin??&quot; She stammered and made a screwed up face. Fujin looked at her blandly 
and stood in the door like a bouncer.

&quot;YES.&quot;

&quot;Umm.&quot; Rinoa looked about again and focused on the woman in front of her.

&quot;WHAT.&quot;

&quot;Quistis?&quot; She asked while looking over Fujin shoulder.

&quot;SHOWER.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s in the shower you mean.?&quot; Rinoa said feeling uneasy being under Fujin&#39;s piercing 
gaze.

&quot;AFFIRMATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Ok righty then.&quot; Rinoa said rocking back and forth as she clapped her hands together. 
Rinoa expected Fujin to move, or try to kill her, or something, but instead she stood fast 
in the door. A painfully long and awkward moment passed.

&quot;Well then.&quot; Rinoa said &quot;I guess that&#39;s all.&quot; She nodded with a half bewildered smile.

Fujin shut the door in her face.

Quistis walked into the living room drying her hair, her bare feet brushing lightly against 
the carpet she made not a sound. She wore a comfortable faded blue button up shirt that 
hung midway down her bare thighs. She saw Fujin squatting by the entertainment center 
thumbing through several CD&#39;s. A haunting melody drifted from the speakers, as a soulful 
and passionate female voice sang softly, of lost hopes and passing dreams. She smiled 
warmly careful not to disturb her, it was a relief to see the woman relax, it made her feel 
more at ease herself. Fujin finally stood and turned coming face to face with Quistis. 
Fujin jumped slightly and her smoldering gaze locked onto Quistis&#39;s winter blue eyes and 
lingered. Quistis offered a ghost of a smile her eyes danced lightly as she tried to read 
Fujin&#39;s expression. As always she was unreadable, Quistis flushed a bit and looked to the 
door.

&quot;So who was at the door?&quot; She asked as she went back to drying her hair. It hung about her 
face in golden waves that glimmered under the pale overhead light. Fujin still watched her 
curiously then turned to replace the CD cases where she found them. She still wondered what 
Quistis was up to but was no longer worried about it being malicious.

&quot;RINOA.&quot; She said with her trademark bluntness. Quistis had learned from Cid, that Fujin 
was mute until she arrived at the garden. Only after intense physical therapy was she able 
to speak and even then words came hard for her. She could only manage short and forced 
sentences which came across as rather hostile to anyone who did not know the truth. Quistis 
had taught her in a few of her classes so she was some what used to dealing with her. 
Admittedly it was difficult at times.

&quot;Well did she say what she wanted?&quot;

&quot;NEGATIVE.&quot;

&quot;Hmm okies I will see her tomorrow then.&quot; Quistis chimed as she turned back to the kitchen 
stopping only to toss her towel through the open bedroom door.

Fujin sat back down and listened to the music, she cautiously let herself relax and begun 
to feel more and more at ease.

Quistis felt a lot better, she liked having guests. She used to have her friends over all 
the time and cook for them, she fancied herself quite the host. Here lately though her 
friends relationships had deepened and she found herself more and more alone, or worse yet 
the sad little tag along to a movie or dinner. She remembered Selphie or Rinoa would invite 
her to go out with them and their respective partners. So then she got to sit around watch 
them hold hands and fawn over each other all night. All the while poor little Quistis got 
to pretend it never bothered her. She finally stopped going along with those little 
excursions and so they quit asking. Quistis found herself sinking into a foul mood so she 
stopped thinking about it.

She fixed their plates with an elegance befitting a gourmet chef, complete with garnishes 
and cleverly designed portions. She smiled proudly at her work and carried them out into 
the living room on a hand tray.

Fujin glanced up as Quistis approached with the steaming meals. Quistis grinned broadly as 
she set the plates on the coffee table. Fujin&#39;s expression was one of shock, she was 
genuinely surprised at the delicate care put into the meal. she looked up and struggled a 
moment wide-eyed.

&quot;WONDERFUL.&quot; She finally managed with astonishment.

Quistis&#39;s smile widened more threatening to reach her ears. She let out a girlish giggle at 
the compliment. She kicked herself for acting like a ninny but didn&#39;t care, Fujin&#39;s 
expression was to just to rich.

&quot;Thank you very much.&quot; Quistis said and bowed slightly.

Fujin was thrown a complete curve and was more unsettled now than she had been in a long 
time. She watched Quistis pulled out two large cushions from the edge of the couch and toss 
them on the floor around the coffee table.

&quot;Come on, sit down and eat.&quot; She said still beaming brightly.

Fujin slid off the couch in a daze and settled herself in front her plate, still trying to 
comprehend Quistis hospitality. Quistis hopped up and scurried to the kitchen merrily she 
fished in the refrigerator, found what she was looking for then hurried back to her seat. 
She sat a dark green bottle with silver foil on the table along with two delicate blue 
champagne glasses.

&quot;Sean&#39;Vere San Pas&#39;.&quot; She said with a flowery grace. Fujin had no idea what she said and 
just blinked. Quistis smiled sheepishly and held the bottle up.

&quot;Its a champagne I bought during the last winter festival in Eshtar. It translates roughly 
too Dew from the heavens. I never really had a chance to share it with anyone till tonight. 
You do drink champagne don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;YES&quot; Fujin said with a shrug trying not to show how nervous she had become. She had not 
expected this kind of generosity from Quistis and it was unnerving her greatly.

&quot;Good!&quot; Quistis said with a bright smile and she popped the cork. She carefully poured them 
both a glass. Fujin stared at it awkwardly not sure what to do next. She had never actually 
tried any sort of alcohol before. Quistis gently lifted her glass and stood. Her expression 
grew solemn and gracious.

&quot;A toast.&quot; She said with slight waver.

Fujin was not sure if she should stand or pick up her glass or what. She instead remained 
seated and hoped for the best, she was quickly wishing she was anywhere but here.

Quistis sighed softly and gathered her words, she felt herself blushing lightly but 
continued.

&quot;To you Fujin.&quot; She said gently and with a beautiful smile. Her mouth was going dry, she 
knew she had to finish this though, so continued without pause.

&quot;For your selfless and compassionate act last night. I was at my worst but you where at 
your best. I bow to you Fujin and I also thank you, from the bottom of my heart. I hope 
someday we can call each other friends.&quot; Quistis finished and bowed graciously. She blushed 
and closed her eyes not daring to look at the other woman. She felt heart pounding in her 
chest fit to burst. She was so embarrassed but it had to be done, it was the right thing to 
do she told herself. An awful silence began to stretch so Quistis opened a wary eye. Fujin 
sat stiffly her eye wide and her lips parted as if she wanted to speak.

She instead abruptly grabbed the glass and downed it in one fell swoop trying to get the 
attention off herself. She regretted it immediately.

&quot;Oh dear. Fuu wait!&quot; Quistis said with a start reaching for her. Fujin recoiled and scooted 
backward into the couch making a painfully adorable face as she went into a fit of cute 
little sneezes. Quistis put her hands to her lips and sat back trying to suppress a fit of 
giggles.

&quot;You&#39;re supposed to sip?.&quot; Quistis started then looked in horror as Fujin glared furiously 
at her then stood to leave.

&quot;Oh no Fu wait!&quot; Quistis said alarmed, she jumped up knocking her knee against the table 
and sending the Champagne sloshing to the floor. She ignored both as she caught Fujin by 
the wounded hand had held it. Fujin hissed in pain and turned on her snarling.

&quot;MOCK ME!&quot; She shouted, her expression was one of hurt and incomprehension.

&quot;LAUGH, TRICK?I DID NOTHING!&quot; Fujin muttered closing her eye trying to remain in control 
though she felt herself failing miserably. She had to leave now!

&quot;THOUGHT DIFFERENT!?..BUT LIKE OTHERS.&quot; She choked and closed her mouth taunt she couldn&#39;t 
stop shaking. Quistis could have cried at the utter look of anguish on her face.

&quot;Oh Fu.&quot; She pleaded taking both her hands in hers bringing them together. She looked her 
in the eye with as much compassion as she could muster.

&quot;I didn&#39;t trick you I swear on everything I hold dear.&quot;

&quot;LIE.&quot;

&quot;No! I promise you please believe me.&quot;

Fujin looked up her expression pained, she sniffed lightly, and kept her eye closed tight.

&quot;FUJIN FOOL.&quot;
Quistis hated herself.

&quot;No Fu?You&#39;re not.&quot; Quistis began to cry in despair, everything had fell apart. She let her 
go and slumped to the ground.

&quot;You happy now? You know you can&#39;t do anything right. That&#39;s what you get for even trying. 
She hates you more than ever now!&quot; She was full of vicious self-loathing. She could her 
herself far away sobbing and apologizing.

Fujin reached for the door but stopped herself.

&quot;You&#39;re jumping to conclusions Fujin.&quot; She told herself. &quot;You&#39;re just wanting a excuse to 
leave because you&#39;re scared of letting someone past your defenses.&quot;

Fujin sighed and looked back at Quistis. Her heart felt heavy like lead in her chest.

&quot;You destroyed her. She tried to reach out to you and you destroyed her, no wonder no one 
likes you.&quot;

I don&#39;t need anyone anyway she thought.

&quot;Is that why you sit and brood all day wondering why they left you alone. Is that why you 
are bitter and jealous of everyone else&#39;s happiness.&quot;

Fujin sighed again she knew she was just lying to herself and it wasn&#39;t Quistis&#39;s fault.

Quistis rocked slowly she just wanted to do one thing right. Just one thing and she failed, 
She felt as though she lost everything she wanted to die. Everything else and now this, it 
was just to much. A hand touched her shoulder softly.
