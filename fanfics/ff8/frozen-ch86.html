It was early morning when Fujin awoke, the sound of metal quietly 
chiming against porcelain caught her attention and she turned her head 
weakly.

&quot;MORNING.&quot; Quistis smiled fondly, a bowl of ice cream in her hand.

&quot;What doing?&quot; Fujin asked curiously.

&quot;SORRY, TEMPTATION.&quot; She grinned, downing a spoonful.

&quot;Stop that.&quot;

&quot;BUT GOOD.&quot; Quistis whined cutely.

&quot;Making me fat.&quot;

&quot;BAH.&quot;

&quot;What time is it?&quot;

&quot;8ISH.&quot; Quistis smiled, offering her a spoonful of the strawberry 
flavored treat.

&quot;Strawberry...&quot; Fujin smiled, wistfully then relented.

&quot;SEE, GOOD.&quot; Quistis smiled richly.

A knock sounded at the door and caused them both to sigh in annoyance.

&quot;ENTER.&quot; Quistis barked sounding more and more like Fujin.

&quot;Um hi...&quot; Nicole smiled sheepishly, poking her head in.

&quot;NIKKI.&quot; Quistis smiled hugely.

&quot;Hi um...Quisty...&quot; Nicole smirked, still not used to the changes the 
two women had endured.

&quot;Stop that.&quot; Fujin groaned, noting the wide smile of Quistis&#39; face.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Quistis asked curiously.

&quot;Grinning, look like a dork.&quot;

&quot;Oh be nice, you&#39;ve a cute smile.&quot; Nicole chuckled. &quot;You should learn 
from Quistis&#39; example. &quot;And you need quit snarling up so much, you&#39;re 
gonna give her wrinkles.&quot;

&quot;Bah...&quot; Fujin huffed, then commandeered Quistis&#39; bowl of ice cream for 
herself.

&quot;HEY!&quot; Quistis whined, reaching for her.

Fujin looked at her defensively, motioning for her to resume chatting 
with Nicole.

&quot;BRAT.&quot; Quistis grumbled then turned around apologetically. &quot;SORRY.&quot;

&quot;No need, I&#39;m glad to see you two in such high spirits.&quot;

&quot;Why here?&quot; Fujin asked, tiring of all the niceties. Quistis cut her a 
stern look then regarded Nicole once more. Unfazed, Nicole toyed with 
her hair thoughtfully.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s Ellone...&quot;

&quot;WHAT ABOUT HER?&quot; Quistis asked, coughing slightly.

&quot;She uh, kinda blew up yesterday.&quot;

&quot;OH?&quot; Quistis frowned.

&quot;Well when she told us that she was unsuccessful...some of us kinda had 
a fit.&quot;

&quot;Us meaning who?&quot; Fujin asked, though already knowing the answer.

&quot;Seifer, mainly, but honestly we all kind of took it bad.&quot;

&quot;OH DEAR.&quot; Quistis frowned.

&quot;She blew up, said we didn&#39;t understand, and that we only come around 
when we want something. Poor Zell, he felt so bad he&#39;s done nothing but 
mope all day.&quot;

&quot;Is true.&quot; Fujin said with shrug causing them to wince.

&quot;FUJIN.&quot; Quistis blurted, embarrassed by her candidness.

&quot;Well, it is.&quot;

&quot;No it&#39;s not, I mean, It&#39;s not like that!&quot; Quistis stammered then fell 
into a fit of coughing. Fujin watched her a moment then rolled her eyes.
&quot;Regardless, she&#39;s upset... I wanted to talk to you two, see if you have 
any ideas on how to cheer her up.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t.&quot; Fujin said simply, licking her spoon.

&quot;WHA?&quot; Quistis frowned, looking at her.

&quot;If try, will not seem genuine.&quot;

&quot;Surely not.&quot; Nicole sighed.

&quot;Na&iuml;ve&#39;&quot; Fujin sighed, setting the now empty bowl down. &quot;Time heals, try 
later.&quot; She added with a yawn. Quistis watched her curiously a moment 
then looked at Nicole helplessly.

&quot;How do you know all this?&quot; Nicole asked, folding her arms angrily.

&quot;Know her.&quot; Fujin answered. &quot;Unlike you, I talk to her.&quot;

&quot;Ouch...&quot; Nicole mumbled.

&quot;HUH?&quot; Quistis blinked, confused.

&quot;While you where um...asleep, Fujin and Ellone have been somewhat 
inseparable.&quot;

&quot;REALLY?&quot; Quistis gawked, looking at Fujin in wonder.

&quot;She came to me with way to find you.&quot; Fujin admitted.

&quot;It&#39;s true, Fujin here didn&#39;t talk to anyone but Ellone the entire 
time.&quot; Nicole concurred.

&quot;WOW.&quot; Quistis smiled.

&quot;Well perhaps you could go talk to her then.&quot; Nicole suggested 
hopefully. &quot;I really hate to see her so upset.&quot;

&quot;Kind of hard.&quot; Fujin groused, looking herself over.

&quot;Eh...right.&quot;

&quot;Will, when she arrives though.&quot; Fujin amended.

&quot;Assuming she doesn&#39;t hate all our guts now and leaves.&quot; Nicole groaned 
miserably.

&quot;Not like that.&quot;

&quot;I hope you&#39;re right.&quot;

&quot;HOW&#39;S SELPHIE?&quot; Quistis blurted, wishing to lighten the subject.

&quot;Huh? Selphie, she&#39;s fine.&quot; Nicole blinked. &quot;Very pregnant though, you 
should see her.&quot;

&quot;Bowling ball.&quot; Fujin elaborated dryly.

&quot;FUJIN!&quot; Quistis gasped in shock.

Nicole laughed brightly.

&quot;I wish you could&#39;ve been at the wedding, it was wonderful.&quot;

&quot;ME TOO.&quot; Quistis sighed.

&quot;I can&#39;t wait till they get back, they&#39;ll be so glad to see you awake.&quot;

&quot;SIX MONTHS...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know, it&#39;s been a long time. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re back, I missed you 
a lot and poor Zell. He was beside himself the whole time.&quot;

&quot;SORRY.&quot; Quistis frowned.

&quot;Oh, no, no, no.&quot; Nicole added quickly. &quot;It&#39;s not your fault silly! 
Anyway, at least you&#39;re back on your feet.&quot;

Fujin arched a brow.

&quot;Um... well, on Fujin&#39;s anyhow.&quot; Nicole giggled. &quot;That is so very 
weird.&quot;

&quot;UNDERSTATEMENT.&quot; Quistis droned.

&quot;You seem to be handling it well though.&quot;

&quot;KINDA.&quot; Quistis blushed.

&quot;Oh, problems?&quot; Nicole frowned with concern.

&quot;Toilet.&quot; Fujin snorted, cutting Quistis a dirty look.

&quot;ACK!&quot; Quistis squeaked covering her face in embarrassment.

&quot;Oh gods... Quisty...you didn&#39;t&quot; Nicole paled, turning green.

&quot;NO! WHAT?! NO!&quot; Quistis blurted in horror. &quot;WAS JUST AWKWARD!&quot;

Fujin exploded into laughter.

&quot;She was embarrassed.&quot; She finally explained.

Nicole looked between the two of them and rolled her eyes.

&quot;You two.&quot; She chuckled, shaking her head.

&quot;HORRIBLE.&quot; Quistis scowled, smacking Fujin atop the head playfully.

*************************

Cid sipped his coffee quietly as he sat on the balcony outside his 
office. The morning sky, misty and cool was a welcome change to the 
stuffy warmth of his office. Of late, he was finding it more and more 
difficult to concentrate on work. Everywhere he looked he was reminded 
of Edea and it is weighing heavily on him and so, with a heavy heart, he 
made a decision.

A cough sounded behind him, causing him to turn in his seat.

&quot;You wished to see me Sir.&quot; Xu asked politely.

&quot;Oh, yes, yes.&quot; Cid smiled, standing to greet her. &quot;Sit please.&quot; He 
gestured.

Xu nodded and took a seat.

&quot;Coffee.&quot; He offered, reaching for the pot.

&quot;Yes please.&quot; Xu smiled.

After pouring her a cup and refilling his own he sat down and stared out 
over the horizon thoughtfully.

&quot;Beautiful view eh?&quot; He smiled.

&quot;Yes sir it is.&quot; Xu said quietly. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been out here 
before.&quot;

&quot;Well, get used to it.&quot; Cid smiled, turning towards her.

&quot;Pardon?&quot; Xu blinked in incomprehension.

&quot;I&#39;ve been doing some thinking. I&#39;m getting old.&quot;

&quot;Nonsense.&quot; Xu scoffed.

&quot;Please.&quot; Cid chuckled. &quot;It&#39;s time I moved on, settled down to enjoy my 
remaining years.&quot;

Xu paled.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t look like that child, It&#39;s not like I&#39;m dying.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re leaving?&quot;

&quot;Retiring, to be more specific.&quot;

&quot;Retire!? But you&#39;ve already cut you&#39;re workload in half, is something 
wrong? I can help; just tell me what to do.&quot;

&quot;Actually, that&#146;s why I called you. I want you to take over as 
headmaster.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Xu nodded then shrieked as it sunk in.

Cid chuckled.

&quot;What!? Me!? WHY!? You, you can&#39;t I!&quot; Xu babbled.

&quot;Take a breath child, you&#39;ll hurt yourself.&quot;

&quot;But what about Squall!?&quot;

&quot;Squall?&quot; Cid laughed lightly. &quot;Squall lacks, how can I put 
this...tact.&quot;

&quot;Oh well...yeah, you could say that.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s better suited for the job he does now, SEED leader. Balamb needs a 
friendly face, someone that can deal with the locals, and to handle 
welfare of the faculty and students.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m hardly qualified for...&quot; Xu mumbled self-consciously.

Cid laughed.

&quot;What?&quot; Xu frowned sheepishly.

&quot;It&#39;s nothing you haven&#39;t done before. You&#39;ve been my assistant for, 
what, four years now?&quot;

&quot;More like five.&quot; Xu grinned.

&quot;See, I have faith in you, you&#39;ll do fine.&quot;

&quot;But wasn&#39;t Quistis...&quot; She started.

&quot;Assuming things get back to normal, Miss Trepe will have her hands full 
with her recovery.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot;

&quot;Well do you accept?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Xu paused and looked down quietly before looking him in the eyes. 
&quot;I&#39;d be honored Sir.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; Cid smiled

&quot;When does all this take effect?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll start training you as soon as you&#39;re ready, but the actually 
transfere won&#39;t be for a while yet. Laguna and I have some things to 
work out in Esthar first.&quot;

&quot;I understand Sir.&quot;

&quot;Good girl.&quot;

&quot;Sir?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Where will you go? Will you stay here?&quot;

&quot;No... I think.&quot; He said softly then paused in reflection. &quot;I&#39;m going 
home, back to the orphanage, to rebuild.&quot;

*************************

&quot;Frustrating.&quot; Fujin grumbled.

&quot;SHUSH, PUSH.&quot; Quistis snapped.

Fujin lay on her back with one leg in the air trying her best to push 
against Quistis palm.

&quot;Take forever.&quot;

&quot;COULD BE WORSE.&quot;

&quot;Quistis is right.&quot; Kadowaki said, looking from where she sat reading 
various charts. &quot;Luckily though you kept her in pretty good shape, I&#39;m 
surprised the physical therapy is going so well. I dare say you&#39;re doing 
better than Quistis is.&quot;

&quot;CAN WALK.&quot; Quistis grumbled.

&quot;Like a drunk.&quot; Fujin grunted, pushing herself on.

&quot;She&#39;s right.&quot; Kadowaki grinned. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re having so much 
difficulty.&quot;

&quot;COME TRY THEN.&quot; Quistis barked.

&quot;No thank you.&quot; Kadowaki smirked, setting the charts aside. &quot;Okay, 
that&#146;s enough for now. You&#39;ll over exert yourself.&quot;

&quot;Can continue.&quot; Fujin said gruffly.

&quot;I&#39;m sure you could, but the body you&#39;re in can&#39;t, take it easy.&quot;

&quot;RIGHT.&quot; Quistis nagged, wagging her finger.

&quot;Foolishness.&quot; Fujin huffed.

&quot;Well regardless, take it easy. I&#39;ll be back later to check on you. 
Quistis, come with me for a moment, I need to run some tests.&quot;

&quot;MORE!?&quot;

&quot;Yes, more, quit being such a baby.&quot;

&quot;HOW LONG?&quot;

&quot;Just a few moments.&quot;

&quot;BE BACK.&quot; Quistis said to Fujin with a grin then lumbered after 
Kadowaki like a Neanderthal.

&quot;Stop that!&quot; Fujin shouted, tossing a pillow at them as they left.

She had just settled down when Celest peeked in.

&quot;Um hi.&quot; She said awkwardly.

&quot;What?&quot; Fujin asked somewhat irritably.

&quot;I was hoping to talk to you...&quot;

&quot;About?&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s kind of awkward.&quot;

&quot;Already is.&quot;

&quot;Um, yeah...&quot; Celest mumbled, looking around nervously, not wanting to 
meet Fujin&#39;s gaze. Seeing Quistis&#39; form peering at her with Fujin&#39;s 
intensity was unsettling.

&quot;What!&quot; Fujin snapped, still slightly irked by Quistis&#39; antics.

&quot;It&#39;s um about... Seifer.&quot;

&quot;Get out.&quot;

&quot;But.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;At least hear me out.&quot;

&quot;Not interested in what he says.&quot;

&quot;No, no, you misunderstand, it&#39;s not about you.&quot;

&quot;Then why here?&quot;

&quot;I need advice.&quot;

&quot;About what!?&quot; Fujin blinked, somewhat curious.

&quot;Well, I like him, and I think...I think he may like me.&quot;

&quot;Stupid.&quot;

&quot;Hey...&quot; Celest pouted.

&quot;Trouble, nothing but trouble.&quot;

&quot;Yeah I know... he says that too.&quot;

&quot;Then listen.&quot;

&quot;I know he has a past, but there&#39;s something there, I can feel it.... I 
think, deep down, he&#39;s really a good person.&quot;

Fujin rolled her eyes.

&quot;No, no hear me out.&quot;

&quot;Heard, and done it all before.&quot; Fujin glared.

&quot;Then you know what I&#39;m talking about. You liked him too once, I just 
want to know how I can get him to be more interested in me, he&#39;s so 
distant now, but I can tell he&#39;d like more.&quot;

Fujin looked sick.

&quot;You&#39;ve known him longer than anyone, what should I do.&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;

&quot;What, why do you say that?&quot;

&quot;Going to do what you want anyway.&quot; Fujin sighed, folding her arms.

&quot;I...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t. You will, and you know it.&quot;

&quot;I guess... but I was really hoping you could give me some insight.&quot;

&quot;Can, evil.&quot; Fujin said bluntly.

&quot;Misunderstood, confused even, but I don&#39;t believe he&#39;s as bad as you 
claim.&quot; Celest sighed.

Fujin would have slapped her if she could have gotten out of bed. 
Instead she sputtered in a mix of baffled rage.

&quot;Ignoramus, Na&iuml;ve, Idiot!&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot; Celest gawked, stunned by the outburst.

&quot;Go away!&quot;

&quot;But!&quot;

&quot;Out!&quot;

&quot;No need to get upset, I just wanted your advice.&quot; Celest murmured 
softly; wounded by Fujin&#39;s anger.

&quot;Just... go...&quot; Fujin groaned; the mere sight of the girl made her 
weary.

&quot;Fine...&quot; Celest sighed, getting up. &quot;Sorry to bother you.&quot; She added 
meekly, then left.

Fujin covered her face with a pillow and screamed in frustration.

&quot;PROBLEM?&quot; Quistis asked, startling her.

&quot;What!&quot; Fujin snapped, harsher than she meant to.

&quot;A YES.&quot;

&quot;Celest!&quot; Fujin sputtered.

&quot;I SAW, UPSET.&quot;

&quot;Ugh...&quot;

&quot;WHAT&#39;S WRONG?&quot;

&quot;Dumb girl.&quot;

&quot;EXPLAIN.&quot;

&quot;Bah, crush on Seifer.&quot;

&quot;OH THAT.&quot; Quistis mumbled.

&quot;Bah!&quot;

&quot;LEAVE EM ALONE.&quot;

&quot;Mistake.&quot;

&quot;WE ALL MAKE THEM.&quot;

&quot;Foolish, he&#39;ll hurt her.&quot;

&quot;WHEN DID YOU CARE?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;WHY MAD?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not.&quot; Fujin steamed.

&quot;HA!&quot; Quistis laughed aloud.

&quot;Fine...&quot;

&quot;TELL ME.&quot;

&quot;Damn...&quot;

&quot;FUJIN...WHAT IS IT?&quot;

&quot;Like me...&quot;

&quot;HUH?&quot;

&quot;Seeing her act like I used to...&quot;

&quot;OH...&quot; Quistis frowned.

&quot;Was fool.&quot;

&quot;WELL...&quot;

&quot;You agree?&quot;

&quot;NOT FOR ME TO SAY.&quot;
&quot;I was, I know it, lovesick fool...&quot; Fujin spat then cringed.

&quot;CALM DOWN.&quot; Quistis sighed, picking up the stuffed Mog as she sat on 
the side of the bed.

&quot;She doesn&#39;t know...&quot; Fujin mumbled.

&quot;UP TO HER HON.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;ll hurt her, watch.&quot;

&quot;I THINK...&quot; Quistis said thoughtfully. &quot;HE KNOWS THAT.&quot;

&quot;Bah...&quot;

Quistis shushed her then lay by her side comfortably, wrapping her in a 
tender embrace. Fujin huffed again then curled up close, Quistis&#39; mere 
presence relaxing her considerably.

*********************

&quot;Thank for walking with me.&quot; Seifer said humbly as he and Raijin walked 
quietly among Balamb&#39;s new park, built in the former training hall. 
Raijin shrugged and looked at the multicolored leaves blowing lazily in 
the breeze.

&quot;Been through to much together, go and bad I can&#39;t just ignore ya, ya 
know.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well about all of that.&quot; Seifer sighed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t man, it&#39;s over with ya know. I forgave most of it a long time ago 
and as for the rest of it, that&#146;s for Fujin deal with now.&quot;

&quot;She hates me.&quot;

&quot;Pretty sure.&quot;

&quot;I deserve it.&quot;

&quot;Yup.&quot;

&quot;Bah, well, I tried.&quot; Seifer sighed.

&quot;That&#146;s what matters ya know.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I guess.&quot;

&quot;Either way, it&#39;s time to move on, from what I hear, Edea gave you a 
second chance, I&#39;m thinking you should make the best of it.&quot;

&quot;Edea...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I heard what happened.&quot;

&quot;It should have been me.&quot;

&quot;Well it wasn&#146;t.&quot;

&quot;I deserved it.&quot;

&quot;Apparently she didn&#39;t think so.&quot;

&quot;Apparently.&quot;

&quot;So what now?&quot;

&quot;Ah shit, who knows.&quot;

&quot;What about that Celest gal, I hear she has it for you bad.&quot;

&quot;She doesn&#39;t know what she wants.&quot;

&quot;And you do?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re not talking about me.&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t we?&quot;

&quot;No, we&#39;re not.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough. Still though, what about her, she seems to think you&#39;re 
interested.&quot;

&quot;Not really...&quot; Seifer groaned then sighed. &quot;Okay, yeah, I guess, I mean 
she&#39;s a good girl and all, but...&quot;

&quot;Then go with it.&quot;

&quot;You and I both know that&#39;d be a bad idea.&quot;

&quot;Yeah well, if you&#39;re both dumb enough to try.&quot;

&quot;I thought you were trying to help.&quot;

&quot;Sorry.&quot; Raijin smirked dryly. &quot;Look, I&#39;ve known ya for years and I 
gotta admit, you&#39;ve changed a lot since last I seen you. I can&#39;t put my 
finger on it, but something&#39;s different, and from what I can tell, it&#39;s 
for the better ya know.&quot;

&quot;Ever the optimist.&quot;

&quot;Look, Seifer, ya know for yourself if you&#39;re ready. You don&#39;t need me 
to tell you.&quot;

&quot;Damn it.&quot; Seifer sighed heavily.

&quot;Look, if the girl is willing to give you a shot, heck you may as well 
try, what the harm in that?&quot;

&quot;Lots...&quot; Seifer groaned, running a hand through his short blonde hair. 
&quot;Ah hell, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s life ya know.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah...I&#39;ll figure something out.&quot; Seifer sighed. &quot;Anyway, what&#39;s 
the deal with you and Jaya?&quot;

&quot;Easy enough to explain ya know, she&#39;s the one.&quot; Raijin said with a 
goofy smile.

Seifer gave him a clap him on the back.

&quot;That&#146;s good, that&#146;s real good.&quot; He chuckled with and approving nod, as 
they continued their walk.

***************************

Celest sat mulling quietly over her lunch in the cafeteria. Confusion 
reigned her thoughts. Seifer, fallen knight, misunderstood villain, lost 
youth, all these could be used to describe him. Gentle soul; however was 
not, especially if you asked most anyone at Balamb. Celest though, she 
saw something different in him, a sadness, a nobleness, buried deep. Or 
perhaps Fujin was right, perhaps she was just being na&iuml;ve&#39; and he really 
was a monster. How could she deny it, especially when he admitted it.

&quot;Damn it.&quot; She groaned, rubbing her face miserably.

&quot;Such sadness.&quot; Miguel said smoothly announcing his presence. Jaya, 
standing at his side smiled warmly down at her.

&quot;Huh.&quot; Celest sniffed, somewhat startled. &quot;Oh, hi you two.&quot; She blushed, 
wiping her eyes.

&quot;May we join.&quot; Jaya asked politely, holding her tray.

&quot;Um, yeah sure.&quot; Celest stammered, motioning for them to sit.

The two siblings exchanged glances then sat down with quaint smiles.

&quot;Sorry I&#39;ve not been very hospitable, I&#39;ve been having some problems of 
late.&quot; Celest explained sheepishly.

&quot;It is not to worry.&quot; Jaya said stiltedly.

&quot;Understandable, affairs of the heart tend to take precedence.&quot; Miguel 
said knowingly.

&quot;Ugh, I take it everyone knows then.&quot; Celest groaned.

&quot;Yes, I do think so.&quot; Jaya said smilingly.

&quot;Wonderful...&quot;

&quot;Do not trouble yourself, life, it is not so hard.&quot; Miguel offered. &quot;All 
things find their path.&quot;

&quot;Easy for you to say.&quot;

&quot;Yes, because it is true.&quot;

&quot;Uh huh.&quot;

&quot;My brother, he is right.&quot; Jaya nodded.

&quot;It&#39;s hard to be so optimistic.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps then, if this man brings you such pain, then he is not the 
one?&quot; Miguel suggested.

&quot;It&#39;s not him, it&#39;s his past.&quot;

&quot;Seifer, he is dark yes?&quot; Jaya asked curiously.

&quot;Dark?&quot; Celest frowned curiously.

&quot;She asks if he is a bad man.&quot; Miguel translated.

&quot;Well... He has his faults...&quot; Celest sighed.

&quot;What Raijin says is true then?&quot; Jaya asked softly.

&quot;Depends on what he said I guess.&quot;

&quot;Raijin claims it was Seifer who maimed his sister...&quot; Miguel said with 
noticeable ire.

&quot;He admitted that to me...&quot; Celest sighed. &quot;Then there is the deal with 
Edea...&quot;

&quot;The witch.&quot; Jaya nodded knowingly. &quot;Thrall of hers as well.&quot;

&quot;Edea&#39;s wasn&#39;t a witch... it wasn&#39;t her fault.&quot; Celest countered 
sternly.

&quot;You love this man?&quot; Jaya asked innocently.

&quot;Love!?&quot; Celest choked then shook her head. &quot;No, but I like him, he has 
an air about him...&quot; She sighed, then shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t know, I 
don&#39;t know anything.&quot;

&quot;Even with what he has done, you still chase him?&quot; Miguel prodded.

&quot;I&#39;d hardly call it chasing.&quot; Celest glared, then softened. 
&quot;Well...maybe it is...&quot; She added self-consciously. &quot;Look, as for what 
he&#39;s done, most everyone agrees he was somehow coerced into working with 
Ultimecia. Now, he claims he did it willingly but I just can&#39;t believe 
that... he and I&#39;ve talked about it. He harbored a lot of anger in him 
and I think that made it easy for her to bend him to her will, even if 
he doesn&#39;t realize it.&quot;

&quot;You believe this then?&quot; Jaya nodded in understanding.

&quot;Yes, because, she did the same thing to one of the other students.&quot;

&quot;What about Fujin then...?&quot; Miguel asked with a grave look.

&quot;I...&quot; Celest sighed heavily. &quot;It was horrible... and he regrets it, 
more than anything I think...&quot;

&quot;You can accept this?&quot; Jaya asked, her expression nonjudgmental.

&quot;Fujin&#39;s moved on, the only one still being tortured over it is Seifer 
himself. Is it so wrong to try and understand him better, give him a 
chance, the same chance Edea herself wanted him to have?&quot;

Jaya and Miguel exchanged silent glances.

&quot;What?&quot; Celest frowned curiously.

&quot;It is just interesting how much you people torture yourselves, when you 
already have your answers.&quot; Miguel chuckled.

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;My brother is correct.&quot; Jaya nodded, nibbling her meal daintily.

&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot;

&quot;You sit here confused, yet you already know what you want to do. Why 
then, do you not simply do it?&quot; Jaya asked with a truly confused look.

&quot;I...&quot; Celest blinked then paused. &quot;You&#39;re...&quot; She started quietly then 
stood. &quot;Thanks...&quot; She grinned then hurried away without another word.

Miguel watched her go appreciatively then blanched as his sister gave 
him a sour look.

***************************

Ellone sat quietly in her room reading a novel she&#39;d been carrying with 
her for the last several weeks despite not hardly making a dent in it 
the whole time. Now though, her fit of anger had alienated her &quot;friends&quot; 
and given her plenty of time alone. She knew she overreacted to a 
degree, but one fact couldn&#39;t be denied any longer, she was tired of 
feeling used tired of being told what to do all time. Taking a cue from 
Fujin she decided, in the moment of bitter clarity that she&#39;d not be 
pushed around any longer and from now on, do what she wanted, when she 
wanted. She couldn&#39;t help but giggle, the memory of everyone&#39;s face when 
she exploded was priceless, never before had she spoken her mind like 
that, it was exhilarating, to take control for once.

Still, she did feel bad, and had every intention to continue helping 
Fujin and Quistis solve their problem, it was the least she could. Of 
everyone, Fujin, even considering everything she was enduring, tried to 
be social even if only briefly and not once did she get the impression 
that it is only out of some sort of guilty gratitude. Not that it would 
have mattered; she wasn&#39;t so selfish that she&#39;d deny help. It was just a 
pleasant surprise. Fujin, in her own odd way had become a cherished 
friend, though she was still standoffish, as was her way, Ellone could 
see glimpses of what Quistis saw in her. A faint smile here, a twinkle 
in the eye there, small cracks in her armor during her moments of 
weakness that allowed Ellone to see her in a different light than most 
others.

Putting the book aside she stood and stretched, it was mid afternoon and 
she was finally rested and relaxed enough to face the trouble waiting 
for her in the clinic. After showering and changing clothes she hurried 
down to Kadowaki&#39;s office. To her surprise, there were no squatters, 
Zell, Seifer, Raijin, none of them were present, just Kadowaki, who sat 
quietly at the front desk looking over paperwork.

&quot;Thank goodness.&quot; Ellone grumbled as she approached. &quot;Um hi...&quot; She said 
awkwardly, announcing her presence.

Looking up, Kadowaki smirked slightly. &quot;Feeling better?&quot; She asked 
smoothly. Ellone straightened and nodded. &quot;Actually yes, a lot better. 
Are they awake?&quot;

&quot;They may be napping, Quistis...I mean Fujin, has started physical 
therapy, it&#39;s taking a lot out of her, let me check.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; Ellone nodded, sitting down to wait. &quot;Where is everyone?&quot; She 
asked as Kadowaki made her way to Quistis&#39; room.

&quot;I&#39;m allowing no visitors, this place has been a zoo lately and it&#39;s not 
helping anyone right.&quot; Kadowaki answered, as she lightly knocked on the 
door, then peeked in.

&quot;That&#39;s good.&quot; Ellone smiled thankfully.

&quot;Yes, I thought it was for the best. They&#39;re up, you can go in.&quot; 
Kadowaki smiled then went back to her seat. &quot;Call if you need me.&quot;

&quot;I will, thank you.&quot; Ellone smiled again, happy that the Doctor didn&#39;t 
insist on being present, it was hard enough to do what was needed 
without an audience. Entering the room, she couldn&#39;t help but smile upon 
seeing Fujin resting idly while Quistis brushed her hair.

&quot;Ladies.&quot; Ellone said, greeting them cheerfully.

&quot;Ellone.&quot; Fujin nodded while Quistis just smiled.

&quot;Am I interrupting?&quot;

&quot;NOT AT ALL.&quot; Quistis responded, setting the brush aside and standing.

&quot;Doing well?&quot; Fujin asked curiously, noting an odd air about the young 
woman.

&quot;Yes, thanks for asking.&quot; Ellone smiled, grabbing a chair. &quot;I suppose 
you heard about yesterday?&quot;

&quot;About time.&quot; Fujin said simply.

&quot;SHOCKING.&quot; Quistis said in slight awe.

&quot;Yeah, well, darn it, it&#39;s something I needed to get off my chest.&quot; 
Ellone said firmly but with a hint of mischief in her eyes.

&quot;Good for you.&quot; Fujin smirked.

&quot;Somehow I knew you&#39;d like that.&quot;

&quot;POOR ZELL.&quot; Quistis giggled.

&quot;What about him?&quot; Ellone asked curiously.

&quot;NICOLE SAID WAS INCONSOLABLE&quot;

&quot;Well good, they should be.&quot; Ellone said with a somewhat snotty look.

&quot;Enjoying this.&quot; Fujin stated with a grin, finding Ellone&#39;s blatant 
defiance amusing.

&quot;A little.&quot; Ellone gestured with a giggle.

&quot;BIRTH OF MONSTER.&quot; Quistis droned, rolling her eye.

&quot;Nah.&quot; Ellone smiled. &quot;I&#39;m fine, I just wanted them to sweat a little, 
I&#39;m tired of everyone riding me all the time.&quot;

&quot;UNDERSTANDABLE.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well anyway, shall we begin?&quot; Ellone said excitedly, clapping her 
hand together.

&quot;YES WHAT ABOUT YOU?&quot; Quistis asked, looking to Fujin, then hacked 
hoarsely. &quot;DAMN IT.&quot; She sputtered amid coughs.

Fujin grinned faintly then looked to Ellone with a grin.

&quot;I am ready to proceed at your leisure Ellone.&quot; She said smoothly with a 
gleam in her eyes.

&quot;GETTING COMFORTABLE?&quot; Quistis groused, cutting her a look.

&quot;You two be nice.&quot; Ellone scolded. &quot;Give me your hands.&quot;

Doing as they were told, Quistis and Fujin got comfortable and offered a 
hand to the older girl.

&quot;Okay, I&#39;m going to try something a little different this time. When 
this happened I wasn&#39;t as deeply connected as usual. So I think perhaps, 
that if I send just the two of you together while I stay on the fringes 
we may have a chance.&quot; Ellone explained.

&quot;IF SAY SO.&quot; Quistis shrugged, trusting her word for it.

&quot;Understood.&quot; Fujin nodded, easily following the idea since she&#39;d been 
here many times before.

&quot;Good, just try not to do anything odd, you&#39;ll both be deep in each 
others psyche. There could be grave risks without me there as a buffer, 
so don&#39;t go poking around.&quot;

Both women nodded in understanding then all three closed their eyes in 
concentration.

They found themselves drifting, floating free, in an ethereal void of 
blue and silver. Worry wrinkled Quistis brow, she was concerned about 
their present situation. Though it wasn&#146;t about their present situation. 
It was more the fact that she wasn&#39;t worried about it that troubled her. 
Brushing aside the thoughts she instead focused on the dreamscape that 
surrounded her. Never before had she dreamed anything so empyreal, she 
was thankful for the distraction.

&quot;Strange.&quot; Fujin said briskly, drifting beside her. Quistis turned, only 
mildly surprised.

&quot;There you are.&quot; Quistis smiled fondly.

&quot;Everything is strange...&quot; Fujin noted curiously while looking around.

&quot;I know, I was just thinking that myself.&quot; Quistis agreed as faint 
clouds of pink and lavender drifted past as a sound similar to a sea of 
tiny bells tinkled in the distance.

&quot;Fruity.&quot; Fujin shrugged earning an enticing laugh from Quistis.

&quot;Don&#39;t blame me.&quot;

Fujin looked curiously at her then frowned.

&quot;Not from me.&quot; Fujin said cautiously, as if somewhat unsure.

&quot;You used to write poetry, perhaps this is some artsy conjuration from 
your subconscious.&quot; Quistis offered. Fujin snorted derisively at the 
idea then flinched as if seeing a ghost.

&quot;Edea!&quot; She sputtered, turning Quistis to face the apparition. Quistis 
paled upon seeing the former matron hovering just a few feet away. She 
wore a simple but elegant black robe and her raven hair billowed behind 
her lazily until it faded into a smoky nothingness. Her skin was pale, 
paler than normal with a faint glow, and her eyes focused on a misty 
patch of flowers at her feet were star filled voids, similar to the 
early apparitions of Aeka and Luccian.

&quot;Griever...&quot; Quistis stammered, her blood going cold with near panic.

&quot;Quistis, calm down, we&#39;re going to loose you!&quot; Ellone called out, her 
voice traveling like a phantom on the wind.

&quot;Easy.&quot; Fujin said softly. Bringing up both hands to caress Quistis face 
delicately. &quot;A representation, a memory, nothing more.&quot; Fujin assured 
her.

&quot;What does she want?&quot; Quistis asked, turning to look at the apparition 
once more as it knelt to pick some choice flowers.

&quot;To speak with you my dear.&quot; Edea said warmly, turning to look at them. 
Fujin flinched. Never before had one of them spoke so directly.

&quot;What!?&quot; Fujin blurted, looking cautiously at the slightly transparent 
figure before them.

&quot;Such pain.&quot; Edea sighed sadly. &quot;I wish I could have been there for you, 
what you&#39;ve all must have endured...&quot;

&quot;Matron...&quot; Quistis murmured, drifting slowly closer.

&quot;Careful...&quot; Fujin warned, moving ahead of her defensively.

&quot;It is I, dear Quistis.&quot; Edea smiled soothingly, her eyes slowing 
changing to normal. &quot;I see you have found you&#39;re way home.&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Quistis whimpered. &quot;Yes Ma&#39;am... kind of... How are you...here?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve always been with you child, as I promised, in mind if not in body. 
It pleases me to see you two together, lost souls, united...All is as it 
should be.&quot; Edea sighed, reaching up to touch Quistis&#39; cheek lightly 
before turning her attention to Fujin. &quot;And you...dear, Fujin, so loyal 
and caring... you&#39;ve changed so much, no longer are you the lonely child 
from so long ago.&quot;

Fujin shifted uneasily, not sure how to take the comment but offering a 
shy smile all the same.

&quot;We have you to thank for that, and so many other things...it&#39;s not fair 
that you had to leave us...&quot; Quistis whimpered. &quot;I never really had time 
to say goodbye...&quot;

&quot;Do not trouble yourself so child.&quot; Edea smiled. &quot;I did what I must and 
now, so should you.&quot;

&quot;What...?&quot; Quistis frowned slightly.

&quot;You two, you are not where you should be. It is detrimental to stay in 
such a state... I fear that if you stay as you are now, that you both 
will die.&quot; Edea elaborated with a stern but gently honesty.

&quot;We&#39;re trying...Ellone thinks....&quot; Quistis started only to be cut off.

&quot;Ellone.&quot; Edea started then paused as her form wavered.

&quot;Matron!?&quot; Quistis called out worriedly.

&quot;I cannot stay...&quot; Edea explained sadly. &quot;But before I go...you must 
understand... Ellone is not the answer; she is only the key... Only you 
alone can repair that which you have broken.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve broken!?&quot; Quistis cried in dismay. &quot;How can that be true, I barely 
know what&#39;s going on as it is.&quot;

&quot;It is your power that caused this child, so therefore only you can 
solve your dilemma, I no longer have the power to help you, only offer 
some small advice.&quot;

&quot;The blue magic...&quot; Quistis gasped in comprehension. &quot;But I can&#39;t do 
anything like this, I never could!&quot; She fretted as Edea&#39;s form continued 
to fade.

&quot;You can do anything you set you&#39;re mind to child, the blood of a 
sorceress runs in you&#39;re veins.&quot; Edea whispered as she faded from view.

&quot;Edea...&quot; Quistis called out softly, her lips quavering with fear and 
confusion.

&quot;My love to you child, to all of you... farewell.&quot; Edea&#39;s final words 
echoed gently as the last signs of her vanished into nothingness.

Fujin gasped slightly and looked to Quistis in wonder trying to read her 
features. Quistis&#39; set her jaw firmly as she tried to sort through the 
various confused and worried thoughts that assailed her.

&quot;Quistis.&quot; Ellone&#39;s voice echoed through the wispy lavender clouds. &quot;I 
can&#39;t keep you here unless you focus.&quot; She warned a hint of sadness in 
her voice. Fujin touched Quistis arm gently, a worried look stressing 
her features.

&quot;I&#39;m okay.&quot; Quistis finally responded, looking at her serenely. &quot;I know 
what to do now.&quot;

Fujin offered a gentle smile of relief as Quistis turned to face her 
then took both of her hands in hers.

&quot;Relax.&quot; She murmured, leaning down to kiss her delicately. Slightly 
confused, Fujin returned the gesture, blushing slightly.

&quot;Ready?&quot; Quistis asked with a slight, nervous grin as they separated. 
Fujin nodded and closed her eyes, waiting for whatever was to befall 
them. Quistis too closed her eyes and let her consciousness melt into 
the ether.

Outside, in the clinic&#39;s lobby, Doctor Kadowaki waited patiently for 
some sort of news. She&#39;d come to expect somewhat of long wait, as was 
the growing norm whenever Ellone linked them. So she was very surprised 
when, just minutes after she&#39;d entered the room, a bright light began to 
shine from around the closed door.

&quot;Oh my...&quot; Kadowaki gawked, rising to her feet. She felt a pressure, 
dull and persistent, pushing against her sub-consciousness, nearly 
making her nauseous. Rushing towards the door, she knocked lightly.

&quot;Ellone!&quot; She called gingerly, not sure if it was a good idea to disturb 
them. Worry overrode sense and she opened the door. Ellone was lying 
sprawled on the floor next to Fujin while Quistis still lay in her bed, 
all three women were unconscious.

Ellone was the first to awaken and did so with a start.

&quot;What happened!?&quot; She sputtered slapping wildly at the smelling salt 
that Kadowaki was holding to her nose. Relieved, Kadowaki put it away 
and helped her up.

&quot;I was hoping you could tell me.&quot;

&quot;Edea... Quistis?! She did something...&quot; Ellone stammered. &quot;Are they 
okay?&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t tried to wake them yet.&quot; Kadowaki replied as they made their 
way to the bed. Fujin&#39;s form still sat in her seat but lay half-draped 
over Quistis&#39; stomach. Raising her up, Kadowaki broke another smelling 
salt pack and had immediate results.

&quot;FOUL! NASTY, DESIST!&quot; Fujin blurted, slapping the offensive thing away 
in half-blind fit.

&quot;Omigoodness!&quot; Ellone squealed. &quot;Fujin, is that you!?&quot;

&quot;WHAT HAPPENED!?&quot; Fujin shouted disoriented and looking as though she 
were about to vomit.

&quot;It is you!&quot; Ellone shouted gleefully, grabbing her in a hug.

&quot;DESIST, DESIST, DESIST!&quot; Fujin croaked, trying not to get sick.

&quot;Thank Hyne.&quot; Kadowaki sighed with relief as she went about trying to 
wake Quistis. It took a moment but finally the beleaguered instructor 
awoke and made a very unflattering face.

&quot;Bright...&quot; She mouthed sluggishly, prompting Kadowaki to close the 
window blinds.

&quot;Quisty!&quot; Ellone shrieked anew, grabbing her in joyous embrace.

&quot;Feel horrible....&quot; Quistis groaned her voice barely audible. &quot;Fujin!&quot; 
She called out worriedly, reaching up weakly in hopes of finding her.

&quot;HERE!&quot; Fujin answered, gripping her hand firmly.

&quot;Thank Hyne...&quot; Quistis whispered, weary tears in her eyes.

&quot;SUCCESS.&quot; Fujin smiled, her own gaze misting slightly.

&quot;Quisty what happened?&quot; Ellone asked, terribly confused.

&quot;Long story...&quot;

&quot;CAN WAIT.&quot; Fujin nodded, quickly readjusting. &quot;REST.&quot;

&quot;Feel so weak...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re finally back home.&quot; Kadowaki smiled sadly. &quot;It could be worse 
though if Fujin hadn&#39;t been so overly diligent in your therapy. Still 
though, you&#39;ve a long, difficult road ahead but hopefully you&#39;ll make a 
full recovery.&quot;

&quot;Ugh...&quot; Quistis groaned at the prospect. &quot;Fujin, get back in here.&quot; She 
chuckled with a weak laugh before slipping once more into 
unconsciousness.

&quot;QUISTIS.&quot; Fujin gasped fretfully.

&quot;No, it&#39;s okay.&quot; Kadowaki assured her. &quot;She just sleeping, she&#39;s 
exhausted.&quot;

&quot;YOU SURE?&quot; Fujin frowned, sitting back by Quistis&#39; side.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Kadowaki smiled as she motioned to Ellone. &quot;Let&#39;s leave them 
alone.&quot; She said quietly as they headed to the door.

&quot;ELLONE.&quot; Fujin called out, causing them to pause. Standing up Fujin 
staggered slightly, before walking unsteadily towards her.

&quot;Yes?&quot; The young woman asked, looking a little worried. Upon reaching 
her, Fujin bowed politely.

&quot;THANK YOU...&quot; She whispered humbly, her voice thick with emotion. &quot;FOR 
EVERYTHING.&quot;

Ellone looked surprised the smiled broadly before hugging her tightly.

&quot;Anything for a friend.&quot; She sniffed happily, before slipping away.
