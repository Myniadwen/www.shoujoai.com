<p>Alicia was happily married for the time being. It was a strange and <em>rushed </em>marriage made by her old   fashioned crotchety parents who had nothing better to do than monger for money   from the pockets of rich suitors. Still, they didn’t exactly choose a bad suitor   for her either- his name was Charlie Smithson, and he descended from a long line   of gondolier sellers. What more of a perfect match could be made? A gondolier   with a gondola maker. He would make the gondolas and she would row them- how   quaint was that? </p>
<p>It   wasn’t all that quaint. It <em>would </em>have   been quaint if Alicia were still an undine, but now she primarily spent her days   flipping through piles upon piles of research books and papers, trying to   determine the location and severity of the next solar storm, the recent   mutations in the marine life, and the whopping increase in blue whales due to a   fruitful mating season. She was a geologist/ marine biologist now, more or less,   and it was boring as heck. She had expected the job to include going on   expeditions and drawing whale feces, but <em>no.</em> That was the <em>manual </em>side of the industry. They   claimed that she was too intelligent for that sort of thing. </p>
<p>Charlie, on the other hand, was well suited for an office job. He was   dry, humourless, and an overall bore. He would make the occasional stab at a   joke but it would come out quite hackneyed and awkward, eliciting a forced laugh   from anyone in the vicinity. He was the head honcho, the big <em>cheese. </em>He was the CEO of the gondolier   company, and right then their biggest buyer was Himeya, who doled out endless   amounts of money to replace the gondolas that were being abused by the new   trainees. </p>
<p>Perhaps Charlie thought Alicia was boring too, mostly because of her calm   and soft spoken demeanour. During dinner time, he would prattle away about his   newest sales, the state of the economy and some drivel about pie graphs and the   stock market on Aqua. Alicia would nod in all the right places and ‘hm’ in all   the correct spots. She dared not correct the man, for she felt a sort of   explainable <em>uneasiness </em>around the   man. Though he was only 25, he acted like a worldly old geezer of seventy and   possessed the same lechery that was stereotyped all over the elderly male age   demographic. </p>
<p>She   was cleaning up his room one day when she found a slew of <em>bondage </em>magazines stashed away in the   back of his closet. It was kinky stuff- those glossy magazines newly ripped out   of the plastic covering- to sum up the whole shenanigan, it was an eyeful of   whips, leather, begging, Halloween looking costumes ,and a bit of blood. </p>
<p>After that incident, Alicia never looked at her dull husband the same way   again. She now harboured the fear that he might have some of those ‘kinky toys   from Manhome’ hidden under the floorboards, all ready and oiled up to whip her   unwilling body with. She now shuddered a little bit. <em>Just </em>a little bit mind you, whenever   Charlie even gave her as much as a smile. They had already consummated their   marriage the night after the ceremony, and that was when the strange vibes   began. He was <em>extremely </em>rough in his   lovemaking. Almost to the point of being brutal- favouring hickeys, the   occasional body check, and....</p>
<p>‘<em>I could have sworn he slapped me once or   twice during that.’ </em>Alicia deliberated as she closed a book containing the   statistics of blue whale mating, ‘<em>I had   some bloody lips after that, but I think that’s dryness.’</em> Alice rubbed her   neck and remembered the red and sore bite marks that checkered the area, ‘<em>I faked my orgasm that night too.’</em> Alicia thought furtively. It was funny how she did <em>not </em>get turned on even once in the whole   affair.  She basically turned into a   mannequin for him to fuck, which he didn’t really seem to mind. Perhaps he was   closet domination fetishist? Alicia shivered at the thought. Those thin brows   and slightly beady eyes would be distorted and scrunched up together in a cubist   parody if he <em>were </em>to give into one of   his fantasies. He would <em>tie </em>her to   the bed and scream in a face that was tomato red, ‘<em>CALL ME MASTER!!’</em></p>
<p>If   it were a manga, Alicia would have had a huge sweat drop going down her head,   but unfortunately....</p>
<p>‘<em>This is NOT a manga. Real life does not work   like fairy tales or slice of life stories.’</em> Alice winced a little bit when   she saw the immense amount of research she would have to do for the next day.   She would have to attend a conference on the unstable nature of the floating   islands. (<em>Sonic </em>Islands, she liked to   call them. That ancient franchise was a huge part of her childhood.) and then   present <em>her </em>theories on the   gravitation distortion the weather stabilizers were wreaking on the tectonic   plates.</p>
<p>So   far, she had come up with the following main thesis: It was like the after math   of a facial reconstruction and shoving your face near a high powered magnet. It   just <em>didn’t </em>work. To her utter   dismay, her research dug out the cruel and undeniable fact that if Mars were to   keep up the Terraformed state for another hundred or so years, the core would   de-stabilize and <em>Kaboom.</em> That meant   that the planet would have to be dried up,<em> cleaned </em>up, and be left   behind.</p>
<p>‘<em>I guess mother nature wins   in the end.’</em> Alicia thought ruefully, ‘<em>Mankind will just never learn to leave their   surroundings alone....’</em></p>
<p>Her   thoughts shifted back to the pink haired apprentice she left behind, and the   thoughts were unsettling. She tried to deny it, but it was quite   clear.</p>
<p>She   was in love with Akari, and she had thrown all that away for a higher position   in society. </p>
<p>‘<em>Don’t forget my parents disowning me if I   disobeyed their wishes.’</em> Alicia thought sadly as she pictured Akari madly   scribbling down her gondola passages over an immense blueprint. </p>
<p>She   probably forgot all about her now, since all of her attention was mostly focused   on training Ai and the other daily burdens of being an undine. </p>
<p>Alicia gave a deep and melancholy sigh. She was rather disgusted with   herself, choosing a high seat in life rather than staying with the love of her   life. She mentally slapped herself again and again for choosing such a mundane   and (potentially) perverted husband who never really shaved and masked up his   body odour with excessive amounts of cologne over lovely and graceful Akari. </p>
<p>Alicia had been over to Aria company several times during the year, and   she witnessed a <em>woman </em>standing in the   place of her once ungainly and nervous student. The visits had been brief,   pleasant, and almost <em>detached </em>in a   way, since there was not much to talk about besides business and other   superficial matters. Not one of them dared touch on the subject of their   separation, for fear that it would open up new and exotic wounds. </p>
<p>‘<em>I could have sworn I saw some pain in her   eyes. I know....’</em> Alicia thought desperately, ‘<em>Could it be that she misses me in THAT   way?’</em></p>
<p>Alicia’s thoughts then turned to the things that her husband would do if   he found that they were eloping outside of his stuffy little world full of suits   and formal papers. He would probably give that scrunched up paper bag look with   two non-existent eyebrows pointing downwards at an unhealthy angle. He would   also probably beat the living shit out of her and then use his reputation to   destroy Aria company.</p>
<p>No.   She couldn’t risk it. Too much was at stake. What if Akari <em>laughed </em>at her confession? What if  she was <em>imagining</em> Akari’s subtle affections the   whole time?</p>
<p>Alicia’s stomach gave a sick lurch as thought of her husband with a   bullwhip invaded once again, ‘<em>This isn’t   the life I wanted.’</em> She thought desperately, ‘<em>The life I wanted was to snuggle up with   Akari every night and live together in marital bliss. What was I thinking!?’</em> Biting the insides of her cheek in anger, she lamented the way she had   complacently brushed away her lesbianism through the years she was with   Akari.  She had denied it until the <em>very </em>last moment, and when she   accepted it-</p>
<p>‘<em>I accepted it when I found myself in   Charlie’s bed- bruised and battered from the wrong choice that I made.’</em></p>
<p>The gondola society would probably piss their pants at the notion   that she was going into the undine business again, since they already   mounted  a huge monumental tribute   to her in the form of a barely clothed golden statue in the middle of the   gondola society foyer. Then again, it <em>would </em>be quite impossible for her to   suddenly reappear at Aria company. The papers were signed and the names were   written in stone. There was no turning back from her <em>stupid STUPID choice.</em></p>
<p>Alicia took off her glasses and looked at her watch. Charlie would be   back around 9 pm. He said something about a mass deal of gondolas being shipped   from earth. <em>Michigan </em>of all places.   Nobody really made cars anymore if they valued their lives. </p>
<p>It   was three in the afternoon. There was six hours to kill.</p>
<p>Enough time for her to go over to Aria company and talk to   Akari.....</p>
<p><em>Aabout   what?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Why....about you true   feelings of course.’</em> The sly devil Alicia hissed, ‘<em>Why don’t you hurry a little? The clock’s   ticking. I don’t think your husband’s going to get another meeting anytime   soon.’</em></p>
<p>Alicia  had been married to   Charlie for three years, and to say that there wasn’t much warmth between them   was an understatement. </p>
<p>‘<em>More like a day in   Antarctica with a popsicle pressed to your cheek.’</em> Sly devil Alicia hissed   once again, ‘<em>Aren’t you tired of living   this life? Don’t you want to get your true feelings into the   open?’</em></p>
<p>Timid Alicia moaned and groaned about how ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix   it.’</p>
<p>‘<em>I know, but can you STAND   not breaking an obnoxious looking vase? I know you want   to.’</em><u></u></p>
<p>The   poor blonde’s palms were sweating profusely now. Just <em>how did </em>this come out of the blue? A   desire to waltz over to her former student’s house and announce an earth   shattering love confession on a random week in the summer wasn’t really the   smartest thinking. What would the repercussions be?</p>
<p>Alicia clenched her fists and gritted her teeth. She was <em>tired </em>of hiding her sexual orientation   from Akari, her parents, and the whole world. She would call her hoity toity mom <em>right </em>after she marched out of Aria   Company  and make her smell the   roses. Afterwards, she would divorce the creepy bastard known as ‘thin-brow   Charlie’. It would all work out eventually.</p>
<p>‘<em>But of course, nothing ever goes according   to plan.’</em> Alicia thought about the simulated feeling of intense G-force   pressing on her insides if her husband were to come back from work early and   found her missing. Yup. The baseball bat and the bullwhip would surely come   after.</p>
<p>‘<em>You betcha he’s going to   thrash you into a pulp!’</em> Timid Alicia squeaked, ‘<em>He’s going to break all the bones in your   body-</em></p>
<p>‘Shut up.’ Alicia said aloud to herself. She found   herself getting her purse and all dolled up to go over to Akari’s place. Had Sly   Devil Alicia been  controlling her   the whole time her inner dialogue was going on? Her lipstick was on, her eye   shadow was immaculately applied. </p>
<p>‘<em>It’s destiny. That’s what it is.’</em> She   thought, ‘ <em>Destiny, pure and simple. I   was fated to be with Akari, and through my own piggish decisions, I threw it all   away.’</em> Unbeknownst to herself, she was crying a little. Several tear   droplets slid lazily down her cheek before she wiped them away in surprise, ‘<em>Don’t want to get your mascara smeared   before this first step out the door, would you?’</em> Sly Devil Alicia said   smarmily.</p>
<p>‘<em>I’ll do it then. I must be out of my mind,   but I’ll fucking DO IT.’</em> With two tentative steps, she took one last look at   the Victorian styled austere mansion and exhaled deeply, ‘<em>I must be out of my mind.’</em> The broken   phonograph in her mind played again and again as she numbly headed towards the   canal that led to Aria Company.</p>
