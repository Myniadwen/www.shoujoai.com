<h1>Alice in Wonder</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../aria/index.html">Aria</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Alice Carroll could date the day her life really began to change to when 
she first met Akari and Aika. She had been practicing with her gondola 
out in a section of the shore with treacherous currents when she came 
across the two singles, struggling with the water. Both seemed surprised 
to see a pair with such skill, but while Aika became angry Akari&#39;s eyes 
were filled with gentle wonder.

Akari Mizunashi was so different from the shy, self controlled Alice 
that she found herself becoming fascinated by her. Akari seemed to be 
able to find joy in almost anything, living her life with a zest that 
Alice could barely imagine. She followed Akari when she took the 
obnoxious Akatsuki on a tour of the city and saw how she charmed the 
abrasive young man, and even found herself joining in as a guide.

Despite Alice&#39;s greater skill she realized Akari was farther along in 
becoming an Undine. Unlike Alice it seemed Akari already had the spirit 
of a good undine within her, and it was only a matter of time until she 
brought it out. And watching her Alice began to understand what she 
needed to do to become a better undine....

Athena Glory smiled across the table at her student as the undines of 
Orange Planet hurried to prepare for their day. &quot;Going out for more 
group training today?&quot; she asked, her short purple hair falling around 
her face, both of them sitting down for breakfast.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Alice smiled, silently thanking Akari for helping her out with 
this relationship, too. For a long time Alice had been unaware of how 
much Athena did for her and Orange Planet, but Akari had helped her to 
finally see. She brushed back her flowing green hair, &quot;Do you, Akira and 
Alicia have something planned for us?&quot;

&quot;No, not today,&quot; Athena chuckled warmly.

Athena, Akira Ferrari and Alicia Florence were the three mentors of her, 
Aika and Akari, as well as being known on Aqua as the three legendary 
Water Fairies. They were considered to be the best Undines as well as 
being old friends. It had rather shocked Alice, Akari and Aika to hear 
that their mentors had also trained together when they were younger like 
they did, but it also seemed strangely right, too.

Athena absentmindedly poured the whole container of sweet syrup into her 
drink as she added, &quot;I did want to tell you that Akira is taking Aika 
out on a training trip, so I think it&#39;ll just be you and Akari.&quot; She 
took a drink then stiffened, her eyes widening as she realized her drink 
was far too sweet, again.

&quot;Ah,&quot; Alice fought back a giggle at the expression on her friend&#39;s face, 
&quot;you never change, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Athena agreed as she tried to dilute her drink, &quot;I suppose not.&quot;

&quot;Maa, Maa!&quot; the little cat stumbled her way through the crowd and Alice 
knelt to pick her up, stroking the kitten tenderly.

&quot;Hello, Maa-kun,&quot; Alice smiled as the little cat rubbed herself happily 
against her hand, purring away madly.

&quot;Sorry Alice,&quot; one of the girls rushed over, &quot;she got away from us 
again.&quot;

&quot;Just don&#39;t lose her,&quot; Alice chided gently, &quot;or we&#39;ll have to have 
Athena sing Maa-kun back out of hiding again.&quot;

&quot;Maa!&quot; the cat agreed cheerfully as she was carried off.

&quot;I&#39;ll see you later,&quot; Athena smiled warmly as she got up to go, Alice 
also realizing it was time for her to head out too.

The city of Neo-Venezia was already awakening even this early in the 
morning, the Sylphs beginning their air deliveries even as boats began 
to make their way down the canals. The gondolas weren&#39;t the fastest way 
to get around the city but that was part of the charm, taking a 
leasurely ride with a lovely lady.

Alice called out greetings to the other Orange Planet Undines as she 
made her way to her trainee&#39;s gondola, her uniform skirt swirling around 
her legs. She carefully stepped aboard then used her oar to push off 
from the shore, drifting out onto one of the many canals criss-crossing 
Neo-Venezia. Gracefully she eased her oar into the water, feeling the 
current through the wood as she guided her craft into the current.

Akari was waiting at their usual spot to meet, sitting with the cat 
President Aria on the shore as they munched on pastries. She waved 
cheerfully as Alice neared, calling out, &quot;Good morning.&quot;

&quot;Morning,&quot; Alice found herself smiling back almost unwillingly. It 
happened a lot around Akari, her energetic personality making Alice 
smile and say sappy things. President Aria bowed to her and Alice bowed 
back, smiling at him too.

&quot;Here,&quot; Akari offered her a bun and Alice sat down beside her, eating 
happily as they watched the sun glimmer on the water.

&quot;So what do you want to do today?&quot; Alice asked curiously between bites.

&quot;I thought we&#39;d stick with the city today,&quot; Akari said as she finished 
her bun, &quot;we need to practice in traffic too.&quot;

&quot;That makes sense,&quot; Alice agreed. She looked a bit sheepish, &quot;We&#39;ll need 
to try to work on our singing too.&quot;

&quot;Do we have to?&quot; Akari laughed shyly.

&quot;I think so,&quot; Alice nodded firmly. They got up together as she asked, 
&quot;Do you want to go together or take both gondolas?&quot;

&quot;Together,&quot; Akari said with a nod, tying up her gondola to the pier as 
she climbed aboard with Alice.

Alice steadied her with her hand and felt a rush as she took Akari&#39;s 
hand in her&#39;s. It felt so good that she stiffened a moment, then made 
herself relax as she guided Akari to a seat. &quot;Here you go, President 
Aria,&quot; Alice smiled as she lifted the cat in, too.

They took turns navigating the channels between buildings, smoothly and 
not-so-smoothly making their way through the town as they each tried to 
play tour guide. Both were improving their memories and prompting each 
other, trading little known facts about the sights all around them.

&quot;You&#39;re getting better,&quot; a smiling Alice noted as Akari finished 
describing the city&#39;s busy spaceport.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Akari flashed a smile as a larger boat slipped by, two Orange 
Planet undines talking cheerfully to the passengers.

&quot;So, do you want to try singing first?&quot; Alice asked, smiling.

&quot;Rock, paper scissors?&quot; Akari suggested and Alice laughed. They played a 
quick game and Akari lost, giving in to singing with a sigh. She stood 
nervously on the end of the boat, taking a shaky breath.

Alice smiled up at her encouragingly, &quot;You can do it, Akari.&quot;

Akari tilted her head back and sang, her voice ringing out gracefully 
across the water. She wasn&#39;t as good as Athena, Alice knew, but she 
still made a shiver run down Alice&#39;s spine. Her eyes shone as she raised 
her voice to the skies, singing a silly sweet song that seemed to suit 
her almost perfectly.

Akari trailed off, smiling sheepishly. &quot;I hope that was alright,&quot; she 
said, blushing.

Alice smiled up at her, &quot;You did great.&quot;

&quot;Well, at least I had fun,&quot; Akari answered wryly. She sat down as Alice 
stood, &quot;Good luck!&quot;

Alice took her place at the stern of the ship, her long green hair 
flowing around her as she cleared her throat. &#39;She&#39;s so cute,&#39; Alice 
found herself thinking as she looked down at Akari. The ballad she sang 
was old, a love song, and one that Alice had practiced more than once 
over her time as a undine.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Akari breathed out as Alice finished singing, &quot;incredible!&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Alice smiled shyly.

&quot;I wish I could have someone feel like that towards me,&quot; Akari mused 
softly, blushing.

Alice nearly said something then, but held her tongue. Now wasn&#39;t the 
time, she knew. &quot;Someday, maybe you will,&quot; she answered instead, smiling 
at her friend. She took the oar into her hands as she added, &quot;Let&#39;s see 
where we can go now.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Akari agreed as they let the current move them forward once 
more.

&#39;Someday,&#39; Alice repeated to herself, &#39;someday, Akari.&#39;

End

Notes: It&#39;s not canon that Alice might be carrying a torch for Akari, 
but it&#39;s not impossible either. Unlike Aika and most of the other 
characters Alice remains unattached, and she has a very close friendship 
with Akari..
