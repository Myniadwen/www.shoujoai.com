<p>The   Aria company house peacefully stood at the southern dock of Neo Venezia. The   first rays of sunlight radiated into the round window that peered into Akari’s   room.</p>
<p>The   bed was empty and made, for she had already gotten up to start the day’s   errands.</p>
<p>One,   make breakfast for Ai and herself. </p>
<p>Two,   chart out the course for Ai’s training session.</p>
<p>Three, go over the financial inventories.</p>
<p>And   finally four, revise her <em>own </em>chart   plotting in order to give returning customers a new flavour. </p>
<p>She   was scheduled to take an entire family on a merry trip through the ancient and   antiquated tunnels that snaked their way here and there in erratic patterns   around the city, but the family had cancelled their trip in favour of going on a   mundane outing through the fox shrines.</p>
<p>Akari played with her luxurious pink locks and hooked her pinkie around   her coffee mug. She liked black coffee these days. If it were a year back, she   would have thrown up after one sip, but the bitter taste was growing on her. </p>
<p>Maybe that’s why they called it an acquired taste.</p>
<p>True, she still retained her cheerful disposition through the months, but   even Ai could sense that something was horribly wrong with her on the   inside.</p>
<p>Akari was pretty sure she had the first traces of bags under her   eyes, for her sleeping over the past few months had not been sound. She had   dreams, and the dreams bothered her <em>immensely.</em></p>
<p>Akari gave a sigh and snaked out another pencil line in the Autocad 2150   blueprint of the city.</p>
<p>Maybe she would take the intersection at the heart of city and then take   a detour into the watch tower. </p>
<p>But   then she would miss the baked potato man- he always gave out freebies whenever   her gondola neared- call it a perk of the job and an added bonus for her   customers’ money.</p>
<p>Akari repeated the phrase to herself like a mantra, ‘<em>Alicia’s gone, and there’s nothing you can   do about it.’</em> It <em>was </em>supposed to   give her a sense of closure, but closing up a one sided infatuation, no- <em>love, </em>was quite an impossible task for   the pink haired beauty of nineteen. </p>
<p>Her   Alicia would be twenty two by now, happily married to a man Akari had never even <em>seen </em>before. </p>
<p>It   wasn’t characteristic of her, but the normally good natured girl felt a seething   anger in her stomach when she thought about said unknown man.</p>
<p>‘<em>How could he just whisk   away my Alicia like that? She’s probably having a grand old time with him. She   never even visits anymore....’</em></p>
<p>It   was at that moment that Akari felt the ugly and utterly <em>bitter </em>sting of jealousy. It was an   emotion rather alien to her, given that most of her life was led in a good   natured and sweet environment free of relationship problems and strife. </p>
<p>‘<em>Aika must be jaded though.’ </em>Akari mused, trying to take her thoughts away from Alicia, ‘<em>She’s had several boyfriends over the years   after she dumped Al.’</em></p>
<p>Thinking of first kisses and confessions created a vicious knot in the   pit of Akari’s soul.</p>
<p>She   still hadn’t had her first confession, let alone her first kiss.</p>
<p>Putting down her pencil and burying her face in one hand, she   contemplated the utter <em>emptiness</em> of   her life and how, besides becoming a full fledged undine, she never had any   romantic relationships. </p>
<p>It   was <em>fear.</em></p>
<p>She   was afraid that Alicia might laugh at her confession and brush it off as another   ‘senpai adoration’ phase. The pain would have been <em>unbearable </em>if that were to   happen.</p>
<p>But   it didn’t happen.</p>
<p>And   now the stifled mass of feelings festered away at the pit of her soul,   threatening to hollow her out into an empty shell.</p>
<p>‘<em>An empty shell with no love lost.’</em> Akari   thought glumly as she pushed her coffee cup aside. </p>
<p>She   thought of the first day she realized that she harboured feelings for other   women. It was at the age of twelve, and she thought herself a pervert. This   wasn’t to say that her parents were overbearing homophobes or anything- they   just harboured <em>extremely </em>high   expectations for their only daughter. </p>
<p>Akari dug her finger nails into her palms and thought about that <em>ridiculous </em>fear that she would   disappoint her parents by coming out of the closet. It was probably too late   now, for her parents were divorced, and her dad was hiding out somewhere in the   new underground colonies of Africa. </p>
<p>Fear.</p>
<p>She   drew another course opposite her original plans. It still wouldn’t be too late   to come out. Aika would no doubt berate her for keeping this crucial secret from   her friends for four years.</p>
<p>‘<em>She will be disgusted with me. She’ll be   afraid of me.’</em> Akari fidgeted with her pencil and found that the side of her   palm was smeared with graphite.</p>
<p>‘<em>And then Alicia will know and think I’m   pathetic.’</em> Akari spat at herself. The clock read eight o’ clock am. It would   be a good hour and a half until Ai got up.</p>
<p>Akari felt tears well up in her eyes as she thought about what <em>could </em>have been.</p>
<p>Suppose she <em>had </em>confessed and   Alicia had accepted.</p>
<p>What   then?</p>
<p>Akari closed her eyes and daydreamed about nestling her head in Alicia’s   soft and volumous blonde hair, while two perfectly shaped and delicate hands   caressed her own. Akari remembered the smell of Alicia’s rose and vanilla   perfume, surrounding the blonde in a delicate misty aura which partially   constituted for her unconscious air of being the unattainable snow white   princess of Aqua. </p>
<p>The   Alicia in her mind smiled warmly and took Akari’s face. No words needed to be   spoken in the idealized fantasy, for they were standing on the beach of   Neverland, bathed in the fiery orange glow of sunset. </p>
<p>Akari felt a tear run down her cheek as she realized that the tender and   soul searching kiss was not real. The perfect portrait of Alicia’s features   shattered as she dropped her mechanical pencil on the floor with a high pitched   clatter. </p>
<p>Wiping away the single tear from her cheek, Akari ignored the pencil and   kept on day dreaming about what <em>could </em>have been. </p>
<p>She   fell in love with the perfect blonde the first day they met, her being in the   undine uniform perfectly tailored to show off her gently curving body and Akari   being in a simple turquoise sundress, still panting and sweating from the   exertion of running to Aria company all the way from spaceport. </p>
<p>She   had blushed a crimson red the next day when Alicia complemented her uniform at   the breakfast table. What an utter <em>fool </em>she made of herself! Thinking that Alicia had somehow noticed her   infatuation.</p>
<p>‘<em>That’s what scared me off.’</em> Akari   deliberated, ‘<em>I never really had the   courage to confess after that moment.’</em></p>
<p>Her   train of thoughts suddenly wandered over to Ai.</p>
<p>She   had blushed the same deep red when Akari unknowingly flashed her ‘the look’ over   a typical Aria company gourmet breakfast.</p>
<p>‘<em>Could it be possible that history is   repeating itself?’</em> Akari felt a sick chill go up her spine, ‘<em>I cannot allow the same thing to happen to   Ai.....’</em></p>
<p>But   then again, maybe she was being paranoid. Akari twirled her pink locks into a   tight knot, ‘<em>She probably already has   loads of admirers at school already. She probably just has senpai adoration.   That’s all.’</em> Akari felt the intense urge to stab her mechnical pencil into   the hand, ‘<em>How pathetic is this? I’m   projecting myself onto Ai!’</em> Her black coffee was growing lukewarm. She   sipped at it and deliberated that she did <em>not </em>like hazelnut roast. Akari rubbed   her temples and discovered an lump. </p>
<p>Strange, she didn’t have pimples before. Perhaps all the stress was   taking it’s toll on her complexion. </p>
<p>Looking at her face in the reflecting window, Akari suddenly realized   that she had grown up quite a bit from her days as a naive and optimistic   fifteen year old. What was once cute baby fat was now replaced by the exposure   of a young woman’s delicate bone structure. Her eyes had grown wiser, and long   gone was her thin pigtails of old. Framing her face were two thick locks of   flowing pink hair, along with waist length hair at the back. </p>
<p>It   was not experience that had jaded her but an <em>emptiness.</em> Akari already lost all her   optimistic hopes and dreams and realized what an undine was <em>really </em>all about.</p>
<p>There were bills to pay and customers that snubbed you. There were bigger   and more intimidating companies constantly threatening to liquefy you, and then   there was the endless loads of paperwork, manual labour, and domestic chores. </p>
<p>And   to think that she thought the job was <em>romantic!</em> Alicia was probably tired of   the lifestyle, so in all her stately wisdom, she went on to pursue the ever more   relaxing job of a researcher. </p>
<p>Akari picked the insignificant little pimple and drank a little bit more   of cold coffee, ‘<em>If I were a man, I would   have a five o’ clock shadow all day.’</em> Akari thought ruefully. In spite of   her stressful job, she still managed to keep the image of a beautiful maiden   sailing away on an arched gondola intact, causing many an infatuated male fan to   send her barrowfuls of fan mail.</p>
<p>Most   of them went in the paper shredder. She only responded to the ones she found   particularly quirky or interesting, like the letter stating that she was the   incarnation of a water siren. There were also letters from female admirers, but   Akari <em>never </em>answered those. To do so   would be to insult the memory of Alicia.</p>
<p><em>`Look at me, I`m   talking about her like she`s dead....’ </em></p>
<p>Another voice appeared, ‘<em>Or   is it like you’re dead to her?’</em></p>
<p>Akari muttered, ‘Shut up.’ To the stupid little voice of blame and tried   to concentrate on map. </p>
<p>Who   really gave a toss anyways? She was almost done. The rest of Ai’s training   course would be improvised. Perhaps she could give Ai a few pointers in   backwards rowing.</p>
<p>A   cheery, ‘ Good morning!’  sounded   from the top of the stairs. </p>
<p>Ai   bounded down along with President Aria, who was as corpulant as ever. </p>
<p>‘Pui   NUI NUI!!’ In spite of his girth, President Aria bounded down four steps and   scampered into Akari’s lap, eliciting a small tinkling laugh from the somber   undine.</p>
<p>‘How’re you doing, President Aria? Ready for breakfast?’</p>
<p>‘PUI   NUI!!’ The cat bounced up and down, stood on his hind legs, and  pumped his arms up and down in  a valiant attempt to cheer in a bipedal   position. Akari’s heart lightened up as Ai padded over in her summer uniform,   afraid to give her senpai a glance as she looked to the ground shyly.</p>
<p>‘It’s your favourite today Ai!’ Akari proclaimed brightly, ‘ Sausages and   hashbrowns!’</p>
<p>Ai   muttered a small, ‘<em>Thanks.’</em> As she   sat down on the other end of the table. </p>
<p>Akari smiled inwardly as she caught sight of Ai fidgeted with her   fingers. Her inability to pull herself together in Akari’s presence was quite   endearing, and it made it all the better for Akari’s assumption that Ai had a   crush on her. ( or was it the other way around?) </p>
<p>Sitting around at a table spread with painstakingly prepared food, (Akari   now knew that food did not magically appear on the table) the three chirped out   their thanks for the olive oil seared breakfast and dug in.</p>
<p>Akari pushed the burdening thoughts of Alicia into the backburner with a   considerable amount of difficulty. It was like moving a couch with a finger. </p>
<p>‘So,   Ai....’ Akari pushed her fork into a slice of french toast, ‘It’s time for your   single test in two days! I think we should try a heavier course this   time.’</p>
<p>Ai   bit her lower lip and pouted, ‘Can’t we take a <em>day off </em>today, Akari senpai? We’ve   already done the canal through the countryside yesterday!’</p>
<p>‘I’ll let you practice backward rowing.’ Akari flashed Ai a radiant   smile, ‘And since my customers cancelled today, I think we have enough time to   do some free sight seeing around the city! How’s that sound!’</p>
<p>Ai   quickly brightened up in simultaneous conjunction with the hopping of President   Aria into her lap, ‘That would be <em>perfect!’</em> she gushed, ‘The weather’s <em>beautiful </em>today too! President Aria can   bring along his sandbox play set, right Aria shachou?’</p>
<p>‘PUI   NUI!!’</p>
<p>Akari kept up her painful smile. It wasn’t really hard to keep up a   radiant smile back in the old days, now it just felt like her facial muscles   were cramping up with a vengeance. </p>
<p>Setting down her fork demurely on the flowered china, Akari wiped her   hands with the silken cloth on her lap and smiled once more, taking any   remaining stamina her face once had with her into hell.</p>
<p>‘Get   your gear then Ai! We’re leaving in ten minutes!’ </p>
<p>Shoving her chair aside and leaving the dishes for another time and age,   Ai bounded up the stairs like an enthusiastic puppy with President Aria trailing   behind in a scrambling ball of corpulent panting fur. </p>
<p>Akari’s smile faded, and was replaced by a sombre look. </p>
<p>Alicia had invaded again, and this time, Akari’s thoughts were beckoning   her to speculate about Alicia’s current life. Was she happy? Was her new man <em>abusing </em>her per chance? Was she <em>truly </em>happy?</p>
<p>‘<em>I’m so pathetic, thinking that she gives a   toss about her pathetic old apprentice....of course she’s truly happy! Did I   think she would be happy without me?’</em> Akari recalled the last day she saw   Alicia Florence as the Snow White of Aqua. The sunset had cast an orange   luminescence over Alicia’s golden hair, creating shimmering patterns of rippling   waves that bounced around playfully every time her oar hit the water. </p>
<p>Akari had held back her tears that day. She had decided she would be   strong for her senpai- besides, she already wept in her arms the day before.   There was no point in evoking another tear fest from the already wet eyed   audience. She remembered the numbed feeling at the back of her skull and the   fuzziness on her tongue as the snot threatened to sneak out of her nostrils. It   was quite a feat, holding back a bawling session brought on by reasons too   complex to explain. Akari recalled the utter <em>stew </em>of confusing images running through   her head as Alicia made her final bow towards her city. </p>
<p>Alicia’s smile, her voice, her lilting ‘my my’s’. </p>
<p>The   warm and reassuring feel of her slight hands.</p>
<p>The   heat emanating from her body on that cuddling session they had at   Neverland.</p>
<p>Akari almost bit off her tongue in surprise as Ai’s pattering steps   turned into ungainly clomps down the stairs, ‘I’m ready!’ </p>
<p>‘Pui   nui!!’</p>
<p>Akari thought over that encounter on Neverland and wondered if it was   actually <em>possible </em>that Alicia   detected some of her hidden feelings in that seemingly platonic sisterly   embrace. </p>
<p>‘Hurry up slowpoke! We’re on the gondola already!’</p>
<p>Akari let the faintest trace of a smile creep back into the corner of her   mouth as she got up from her chair.</p>
<p>‘I’ll be there Ai.’</p>
