<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It has been  almost two weeks now since Nanoha was returned to us. The days are  flying by carelessly now that everything has fallen back into routine.  All of the forwards are training extra hard now since Nanoha seems to  want to make up for lost time by being tougher on them. It was fun to  watch their battles sometimes. Because Nanoha lowered her limiter to B+  in order to go all out on the forwards, she has actually lost one  battle thanks to Caro’s dragon lighting her ass on fire. Quite  literally. The memory brings a smile to my lips. Nanoha had jumped into  the water around the training area to put out the flames that just so  happen to burn a hole through her barrier jacket and reveal the cutest  little pink and white stripped panties. Everything definitely seemed to  be getting back to being ‘normal’ now, even though there were a handful  of unanswered questions. Elio’s armor, the small purple haired girl  Nanoha mentioned, the new jewel seeds, and several more that were  hovering around the sixth mobile division. I couldn’t help but feel as  if everything that’s happened up until now was just life’s way of  preparing us for a harder battle to come, and truthfully I’m a little  scared. At least now I can press forward again, with the help of my  girlfriend by my side. Even my doubts and fears seemed to fade into  nothing as long as she was with me, which thankfully seemed to be  constantly lately. In fact I don’t think we’re apart for more than a  few hours a day now.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By: Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chaaaaaaaan!”  Nanoha hopped to a stop in front of her office door, smiling brightly.  “Come on, it’s time to go, we need to prepare for tomorrow!” She walked  in the room and looked around while the blond smiled to herself and  finished up her typing. “So many pictures…” She continued along her  way, pausing at one of Subaru and Tia. The former was sitting under a  tree with Tia asleep with her head on the other girl’s lap. “Aw, what a  cute couple. I noticed them acting really flirty with each other lately  I was wondering if something was going on between them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Seems  that way,” Fate confirmed as she saved her work and allowed the  displays and keyboards to vanish. “I’m ready now,” She grabbed her  purse and stood up. “What you looking at?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha reached up and  touched the frame that had Caro happily riding Freidliche in his giant  form. “I missed so much in such a short time… My little girl’s first  summon… My stars members starting to like each other… Elio’s unknown  power up…” Letting out a sigh she closed her eyes lightly. “Amazing  what can happen in a span of a month or so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha…” Fate  wrapped her arms around her from behind. “Don’t let it get to you,  everything’s okay now. It won’t happen anymore so don’t dwell on it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  was hard for you too… I heard everything when you fought with ‘her’. I  know you accept it but it must still hurt to learn something new.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  its okay. I gained valuable information on the man we’re after. I’ll  take him down eventually; this is just a step in that direction. The  girl you mentioned, Lutecia, seems to be connected, and is being  investigated by Yuuno. Did you know he will be moving in our building  soon?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, he called me this morning.” Nanoha smiled lightly. “It’ll be great to have him so close again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, you’ll make me jealous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha giggled, pleased at the change of topic. “Oh please, you’d get jealous over Subaru if I ate lunch with her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Would not!” Fate blushed darkly as she pulled away and crossed her arms. “But I can see how you’d think that, she <em>does</em> have bigger breast than you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha’s eyes watered up. “Fate-chaaaaan! That’s mean!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blond looked behind herself and smiled, sticking out her tongue. “Nyahaha.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  my laugh, you can’t have it!” Nanoha flailed out her arms dramatically.  Fate watched her girlfriend puff out her cheeks in annoyance a moment  before humphing at her and looking away. A few moments went by in  silence before Nanoha glanced over her shoulder to make sure Fate was  still paying attention to her little temper tantrum and was pleased to  find the blond still interested. “I suppose I can forgive you this one  time, though, since you’re going to rub my back tonight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, since when did I become the rub rabbit? That’s your job.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  winked at her playfully as she turned around and took her hand to lead  her out of the office. “Come on, we need to finish packing and be sure  we’re ready.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re only going to be gone three days,” Fate  laughed as they made their way across the base to the residential area.  “We don’t need to pack everything in our closets.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure we do,” She countered. “You’re always too shy about clothing, you need to express yourself more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Simple is fine for me, miss weird color underwear.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blue eyed girl put a hand on her hip. “I <em>like</em> my underwear. At least I have colors besides black and purple.” Her  conversation paused when she spied Caro a few paces in front of her  walking her dragon. “Caro-chan!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mommy!” Caro stopped and allowed them to catch up to her. “Good evening,” She bowed to them lightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh  stop being so polite, its okay.” Nanoha hugged her happily. “And hello  to you as well, Freidliche.” She reached out and pet the dragon  affectionately, receiving a low purr/growl in return.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He says hello,” Caro translated for them. “Are you and Fate-san going on leave tomorrow?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  are. On my home planet it’s a major holiday so I want to go visit my  family… Hey, do you want to come too? I can introduce you to everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro  gave Fate a nervous glance before shyly shaking her head. “I-I’m sorry  but I have some business here… I…um… have to… help Shamal-sensei with  some things regarding my summoning power.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw, okay then.” Nanoha stood back up properly. “Don’t go walking too long, its getting dark.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll be okay, I’m meeting my dragoon at the jogging track.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your dragoon?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  what she calls Elio,” Fate told her with an amused smile. “She calls  him that sort of like Hayate calls her knights her children.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” She smiled down at her. “Well then, be sure your dragoon gets some rest tonight as well, okay little Princess?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay!” She nodded happily and waved as they walked away from the girls.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Those two are going to be the cutest couple on the base when they’re old enough to realize what love is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh  yes,” Nanoha re-took Fate’s hand and began walking into the building  again. “We better step up our game or we’ll lose the number one spot!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“I’m  home,” Tia greeted softly to the dark room, carefully walking in and  turning on a small desk lamp to give her some light. A soft moan  greeted her, bringing a smile to her lips. “I didn’t wake you did I?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,”  Subaru answered honestly as she rolled over to look lazily from her  pillow and allowing one hand to hang off the top bunk. “But I don’t  mind.” She hazily watched Tia change for bed, guiltily allowing her  eyes to look at her body. “You’re sexy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru!” Tia flushed,  instantly turning off the light and plunging herself in darkness.  “Don’t say things like that…” Tia hurried to finish, blushing more at  the insanely cute laugh she received. Once changed, she walked over to  her bed and lightly ran a finger down Subaru’s arm. The hand replied  instantly, moving to grip hers and giving it a loving squeeze.  “Hey…Subaru?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes Honey?” She replied happily, using her own little pet name for her girlfriend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um…”  She stood on her bed and held onto the siding of the top bunk so she  was just a little above the sleepy girl. “Would you mind if…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  kissed me goodnight?” She finished for her, looking up at the dark  figure above her. “Or were you going for something else?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia  chose not to answer, instead feeling her way to Subaru’s cheek and  gently leaning forward, kissing her forehead. “Sweet dreams, Subaru.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sweet  dreams, Honey.” She smiled up at her a moment longer before leaning up  and pecking her cheek. “Get a good rest, we’re going to be busy  tomorrow setting everything up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia laughed to herself. “That Fate… She doesn’t underplay anything does she?” Subaru joined in on her laugh as well.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Come <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">on</span></em> Nanoha, I’m burning up!” Fate fanned herself as best she could,  adjusting her sweatshirt and fluffing her hair to keep her neck from  sweating. “Its eighty-five degrees and I don’t want to stand around in  winter clothes any longer than I have to.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And be good,” Nanoha  finished saying her goodbyes to her friends and hugging Caro one final  time. “I’ll be back in three days but don’t slack off on your  training.” She looked over at Vita and smiled down at her. “Give’m hell  Vita-chan.” She reached out and ruffled the girl’s hair. When the  smaller woman didn’t protest Nanoha blinked at her. “Aw it’s not fun  unless you snap at me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was holding back because you were gone  so long!” Vita removed the hand from her head and glared at her,  blushing hard. “Mou, don’t push it.” Despite her words the girl gripped  the hand tighter a moment before letting go.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure, sure.” Nanoha  waved to the rest. “Okay, I’m ready.” She adjusted her thick dress and  teased the fluffy ends of them to make them stand out more. Her black  knee high winter boots clicked on the floor as she stood next to her  girlfriend on the platform. “Beam me up Scotty!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate put her face in her hand. “Do you <em>have</em> to say that every time we teleport?” The two phased out the next  moment, jumping to a war ship far away. From there they teleported once  more and landed inside a small barrier on a planet. Looking around,  Fate smiled to herself. “Wow, it’s been so long.” The two stepped out  of the barrier after making sure no one was around. The wind hit them  suddenly, making both girls shiver despite their winter clothing. “Its  so weird being summer time one moment and the next in the dead of  winter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nyahaha.” Nanoha bounced in place happily to try and keep herself warm. “Let’s get to my parent’s house quickly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lead the way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  brown haired girl smiled as they walked. “Everything looks the same,  hard to believe I haven’t been here in over two years.” She took a long  intake of air. “Ahhh, nothing like crisp winter air.” Her statement was  finished with a light cough. “Ugh, I can <em>taste</em> the pollution.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  laughed out merrily. “I think I said the same thing the first time I  came here; Midchildra hasn’t had a pollution problem for hundreds of  years.” Her eyes scanned the area, instantly finding the tall building  she stayed in. Her eyes then scanned more, seeing her old apartment  complex. “This is my first time back too since we graduated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  couple made their way along the sidewalks while reminiscing about old  times. Everything from their first meeting and thoughts about it all  the way up to where they met Hayate and the knights were shared. Fate  was amused to find out that Nanoha first noticed her hair when they met  and in turn revealed that she first took notice of Nanoha’s ‘funny  looking barrier jacket’. This of course led to Nanoha teasing Fate  about her own scantily clad ‘loli-pedo’ barrier jacket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  conversation continued until they finally reached their destination and  paused outside the gate leading up to Nanoha’s old house. “Wow,” she  breathed out as she took it in. “They painted it and the dojo… It looks  so inviting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well don’t just stand here, go in.” Fate laughed, pushing her forward.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do I look okay? Is my hair right? My make up isn’t smeared is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  look fine! Stop worrying about impressing them and go!” Fate gave her  an encouraging smile. “It’s your family for crying out loud.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your  right,” Nanoha shifted her duffle bag over her shoulder and walked up  to the door to ring the doorbell. “Never thought I’d do <em>that</em> to get in…”  The two only had to wait a few seconds before an eager woman answered it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!?”  Miyuki asked, smiling at her little sister who waved happily. “Come  here you!” She hugged her tightly making the other girl laugh out and  return it. “Wow you’ve grown! You can’t tell in the video letters!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nyahaha, I try.” She motioned to her partner. “Fate made it as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello,” Fate bowed lightly but was quickly embraced in a hug.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh  stop being so reserved, you’re basically family!” Miyuki smiled  brightly and ushered them both inside, where they were also greeted by  the rest of the family.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“About time, we were wondering if you  would make it.” Kyoya told her, giving her sister a hug as well. “You  didn’t even give us a date in your letter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,” She smiled, getting a bear hug from her mother and father at the same time. “It’s been a little hectic lately.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell  us all about it!” Miyuki asked excitedly. “You’ve already been promoted  so many times, it’s always so amazing to hear your stories!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nyahaha,” She scratched the back of her head. “You wouldn’t believe the latest one even if I told you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Easy  now, lets let them settle down.” Shiro told them. “We can talk about  all that in a bit.” He smiled at Fate and gave the girl a hug as well.  “Hello Fate-san, glad to see you again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You too, Takamachi-san.”  She returned the hug happily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Call me Shiro,” he chuckled. “How many times have I told you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,” Fate blushed lightly, getting hugs from everyone else as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where should I put my stuff?” Nanoha asked, picking up her bag again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your room of course,” Momoko giggled. “We re-arranged it a little bit but its still your room.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You did!?” She ran up the stairs quickly to go see.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nervous?” Miyuki asked Fate with a grin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very,” She replied honestly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can I see it?” Momoko walked over to her eagerly. “Please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,”  Fate sat down her bag and unzipped the side pouch to pull out the  single item in it. “I probably checked to make sure it was here at  least a thousand times before we came.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha gasped out when  she saw her room. It was no longer blindingly girly but was instead a  cool cream color with family photos along the wall. Setting her bag  down, she walked around the room curiously. There was a small section  on the wall that had a row of pictures of Nanoha, from the first being  one of her wearing her TSAB uniform for the first time all the way up  to the present, where she was wearing her 6th Division brown uniform.  On top of the row were two pictures of her different Barrier Jackets  and below them were pictures of Nanoha and Fate together, even complete  with two pictures of Fate’s Barrier Jackets. “Home sweet home,” She  whispered to herself.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“It’s  going to be cold there.” Caro told Elio when he walked up to the group  of people hanging around the teleporter. “You should have put on  something warmer.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t really have any winter clothes,” He  admitted lightly, scratching the back of his neck shyly. “So jeans and  a long sleeved shirt are the best I could come up with.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t  want you to catch a cold,” Caro pulled off her pink scarf and wrapped  it around his neck before tying it in a fluffy bow. “There, that will  keep you a little warmer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru covered her mouth but didn’t  quite stop the loud laughing that followed. Tia elbowed her in the ribs  but the blue haired girl couldn’t help herself anymore. “Oh my god,  he’s so <em>cute</em>!” She put both hands on his shoulders and leaned down to him. “You’re <em>darling</em>,  Elio!” She laughed again, finally making Tia snort to herself and turn  around to cover her own repressed giggling. The boy, however red,  didn’t remove the article of clothing. Instead he gripped Caro’s hand  and looked down at her smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We all here?” Hayate asked,  wearing a formalish winter outfit complete with black stockings and a  fluffy white buttoned up jacket. It came complete with a matching purse  and boots, which clacked against the tile when she walked. Her eyes  scanned the area seeing all the forwards, her knights, as well as  Chrono, Amy, and Yuuno. “Well then, let’s be off!” She watched a few of  them teleport off at a time, stopping only when She saw Freidliche walk  up along with Elio and Caro. “Whoa, Caro, your dragon can’t go!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why not?” She asked innocently. “He’ll be good, I promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  not that…” She tried to think on how to word it. “He will… make a lot  of people scared. We’re going to a non administrated normal planet,  people there don’t know about magic or for that matter, most anything  we have or can do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not even classified as ‘advanced’?” Elio wondered, amazed. “Fate-san never told me that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, so…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro  hugged her dragon and gave Hayate puppy dog eyes that she had learned  from none other than Nanoha herself. “Plleaaassssseeeeee?”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Wow,  its great taking a bath in your old bathroom again.” Nanoha happily sat  on her bed in only a towel while she dried her hair. “What a day, I  can’t believe we went all over town. I think my feet are going to fall  off.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re too used to flying,” Fate mused as she finished combing her still damp hair. “Want to get in bed early?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  guess,” Nanoha fell back on her bed and sighed out. “Back home again  and I have Fate-chan to keep me warm on a cold winter’s night. Doesn’t  get much better than this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Fate cut off the lights and got in bed next to her. “Well then, allow me to keep you warm while we sleep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually…”  Nanoha undid her towel and tossed it across the room. “One thing I’ve  always really wanted to do…” She whispered huskily into Fate’s ear. “Is  make love on this bed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!” She blushed darkly. “Your parent’s room is <em>right</em> next to us, and your brother and sister are too!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll bite a pillow,” She replied, running her hand across Fate’s stomach already. “I’m not missing this chance, Nyahaha.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou, you.” Fate kissed her regardless. “Dibs on top.” She rolled Nanoha over quickly.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Merry  Christmas Eve,” Nanoha yawned out as she woke up. Her stretch awoke her  sleeping partner, who immediately pulled a pillow over her head. “Fine,  you can sleep in. I’ll make you some coffee.” She got a sleepy hum and  watched Fate roll onto her back when she was no longer there to hold  her. The girl left her room happily walking down the familiar layout of  her house while trailing her fingertips along the walls. The kitchen  was empty so she made herself at home and turned on the coffee maker  before looking around for the beans. Having a cake and coffee shop  mostly all her life, Nanoha had truly learned to make a great cup of  joe, something Fate appreciated immensely on a daily basis.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  slipper-clad feet made soft sounds as she walked around the counter and  over to the living room to look out the window. Snow was falling softly  outside but didn’t seem to want to stick to the ground before melting.  As the smell of coffee started to drift to her nose she thought back on  the past events. She had told her family most of everything that  happened to her lately, leaving out the part that Skeith was really  her. The battle ended with Fate talking her down into submitting and  turning herself in, which wasn’t really far from the truth. The thought  of the battle made her mind drift off again, recalling the girl known  as Aura in her dreams. She was still there, Nanoha could tell, but  there was almost nothing left; Aura was asleep, probably forever.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  sound of water dripping stopped, calling her attention back to the  coffee machine where she poured what she had steeped into a glass  pitcher and put it on the warmer before grinding more beans and setting  up the water and filters. This time she a made a mix of different  blends and used a different method, making herself some cappuccino  instead. Her hands went on auto-pilot, mind being elsewhere. Nanoha’s  team members came to her memory, bringing with it a soft smile. Tia and  Subaru were a couple now, she had officially decided it for herself  after catching them gazing into each other’s eyes while holding hands  under a tree. They seemed to be hiding it so the girl had left them  alone, thinking it best to let them silently work out their problems  and emotions.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro and Elio also seemed to be a couple, although  neither one really understood what that meant. The thought made Nanoha  laugh briefly to herself and shake her head with an amused look. ‘<em>It’s like looking at Fate-chan and myself</em>’ she thought merrily as she poured her finished product into a cup and started to froth some foam onto it. ‘<em>Back  then we didn’t know what “love” or even “like” meant. All we understood  was that it was a nice feeling to be next to each other…</em>’ Her breakfast cup was finally finished so she took it and walked over to the window again before sipping on it. ‘<em>Caro  calls Elio as if he belongs to her, and Elio calls her his princess. My  little girl seems to always be touching him in one way or another,  maybe I should take a few pictures of them so I will have something to  think back on…</em>’ the thought made her hand instinctively go up to  form a yellow screen to take a picture, but when nothing happened she  had to laugh at herself. The M2D didn’t work on this planet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>It’s so peaceful,</em>’ her mind wandered again as the sounds of people waking up started to echo through the quiet house. ‘<em>Sometimes  it’s weird… There are people out there who are doing things that we  don’t understand, people I will have to hunt down, questions that have  no answers…But here, right now, everything is calm.</em>’ She turned  around when her mother came into the kitchen and grinned at the amused  look she received. “What?” She asked with a giggle. “Am I not allowed  to sleep in a little when I’m home?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve done that ever since  I can remember,” She mused, pouring herself a cup of the coffee and  sitting at the table. “You would wake up at four in the morning and  sneak off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You knew?” Nanoha sat across from her, shocked. “But…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your  sudden increased appetite and sleeping earlier made me believe you were  out jogging but didn’t want your sister or brother to tease you about  it so I just thought you went out earlier than them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Nanoha drank a slow sip. “I was out training, but you probably guessed that after we told you everything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  a shock that was,” Momoko leaned back in her chair. “And now here you  are, almost twenty and already a high ranking officer of some  inter-galactic military. And I thought you were going to stay home  until you were married.” She grinned knowingly, sipping her drink.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  only,” Nanoha propped her cheek up on her hand and her arm on the  table. “We’ve been together for almost seven years, I don’t even know  if it’s crossed her mind, let alone enough to ask me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just give  her time,” She reached out and pet Nanoha’s other hand. “She’s a shy  girl, maybe she’s just waiting for the right moment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, I need  to wake her up or she’ll sleep for another few hours.” Nanoha stood and  laughed. “It’s actually probably only two or so in the morning on  Midchildra. I’m used to taking naps so time changing isn’t really bad  for me. Fate-chan on the other hand…” She covered a smile. “She’ll  sleep all day if I don’t wake her up and giver her some coffee.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“You  about ready?” Nanoha finished putting in her earrings and rooted around  her mother’s make up case to find a light shade of pink lipstick.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh? Um, y-yes.” Fate shifted nervously, looking herself over in the mirror next to Nanoha.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou, relax. I know we haven’t been on a date in a long time but sheesh, you’re acting like a teenager.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I <em>am</em> a teenager,” She countered while trying to fix her hair that was curled  at the ends. “I’m not nervous.” Her statement was made even more  unbelievable by accidentally knocking over a few things on the table.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your  hand are shaking, what’s wrong?” Nanoha gripped them and rubbed Fate’s  palms. “Are you feeling sick? Shamal-sensei said that you can sometimes  get sick by planet hopping?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, no, I’m fine.” She stood up and smoothed out her tight fitting black gown. “I look okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lovely,  as always.” Nanoha straightened up her girlfriend’s necklace and  smiled. “There, perfect.” She gave her a quick kiss. “Let’s go, our  reservation is in half an hour.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Fate followed her out of her room and down the stairs, where other people were waiting.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, you are all going out as well?” Nanoha wondered absently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  we are going to the Italian place across town. You go ahead and go, we  had to make your reservations months in advance.” Momoko waved at her  daughter. “I knew you’d want to go out when you were back here again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks mom,” Nanoha smiled and waved back, guiding Fate out the door. “Sorry we have to take a taxi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry, its not like we have a car on this planet.” Fate smiled lightly, looking in her purse.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Honey  you’ve checked your purse a hundred times already, you have everything  you need.” The brown haired girl giggled. “My, you’re so funny tonight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you?” Fate gave her a grin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  way to the restraint was made quickly and they merrily walked past the  long line of people waiting outside. Upon entering Fate walked up to  the Maitre D and smiled at him. “Reservations for two, Harlaown.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah  yes, Harlaown-dono, we have been expecting you and your wonderful  partner.” He gave the two a small bow. “Please, allow me to show you to  your table.” He took two menus from the counter and guided them along a  short hallway and into a rather large room with tables around the sides  and a large open area in the middle for dancing. A live band was  playing soft music up at the front, paired with several couples slow  dancing to the tone. The girls were shown their table and Fate  instantly pulled the chair for Nanoha, making the girl blush. “Your  menus, my ladies.” He handed them to the women after seating Fate and  smiled, taking the ‘reserved’ slip off the table. “I shall have my  finest waiter come shortly, please enjoy your meal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh wow,”  Nanoha looked around. “Everyone is in tuxedos and evening gowns… I’m  not under dressed am I?” She looked down at the fancy pink dress her  mother let her borrow for the night.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not at all,” Fate couldn’t help but smile. “You’re beautiful, Nanoha.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw,”  The girl felt her cheeks color yet again. “Stop it, Fate-chan, you’re  embarrassing me…” She looked down shyly. “I guess I’m a teenager too,  huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In all the best ways,” Fate nodded at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Small  talk was made casually between them, ranging from nothing to  everything. In the background music played softly, setting a romantic  mood over the entire place while they waited. When the waiter came to  them Fate ordered for her friend and then herself. She got a small bow  and the two were once again left to themselves. Although the time it  took to get their meal took forever, the girls didn’t even seem to  notice it. Instead they were happily flirting with each other at their  table. Nanoha seemed very pleased with what Fate had ordered her, which  made the blond breathe a sigh of relief.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The maitre D came back  over to them when their meal was finished and gave a small bow before  addressing them. “My ladies, was everything satisfactory this eve?” He  smiled at them when both complimented the food. “Please, feel free to  join in on the dance floor?” He looked over at Fate and raised his  eyebrow at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-yes,” She nodded a little nervously. “Let’s dance, Nanoha?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay!”  She thanked the person when he helped her chair slide back. Nanoha  offered her hand to Fate, who took it after nodded to the maitre D one  more time. “We haven’t danced for real in ages either, have we?” She  wondered absently as they walked to the floor when a new song started.  “I hope I don’t embarrass you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No way,” Fate lead the dance  slowly, pleased when Nanoha wasted no time in resting her head on her  shoulder. Combined with Fate’s high heels and her natural height  advantage she was the perfect height for her partner to lean on. “Your  hair smells nice,” She mused after a moment, getting a happy giggle in  return. The red eyed girl looked around the room as they danced,  meeting several people’s eyes and getting smiles. The song ended slowly  and faded seamlessly into the next, complete with a new female singer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Far in the light, I can see it. In every scene of the night: a tiny feather of love.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  blinked, pulling away from Fate just enough to look up at her. “Hey,  you hear that?” She smiled. “It’s our song! What are the odds?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Even in the night I see your face, in the dark. So I never lose my way to you, I never close my heart, the light is always there</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  paused her talking when the lights suddenly got dimmer around them and  a spotlight slowly illuminated the area they were dancing. “Hey… What’s  going on?” She looked up at Fate, who was smiling nervously but  excitedly at the same time down at her. “…Fate-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha…”  Fate stopped dancing and spoke to her fully, absently realizing that  the sound form the music had been dimmed. “I love you very, very much…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  love you too,” She replied instantly, eyes suddenly going wide when  Fate reached into her purse that she had taken with her onto the dance  floor. “Oh my god…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So,” Fate continued, slowly kneeling down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha,”  The word made the girl snap down to look at her, seeing Fate open a  small black velvet case and revealing a diamond ring. “Will you be my  bride?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl brought a hand to her mouth in shock. “I…Wow…. I  mean…Ye….that is…” She stammered over her words, glancing around the  room when she realized everyone’s eyes were on them. During her look  she noticed Yuuno watching her while dancing with Hayate, as well as  Chrono and all the knights scattered around the room. “Oh my!” looking  more, she saw her students grinning at her from the side of the dance  floor as well as her family. “I…I, wow…” She repeated her words, still  stammering to answer. Finally her eyes met Alisa and Suzuka who waved  at her discreetly. Nanoha’s eyes turned back down to Fate, who was  still holding her breath. “Ye….” Her word never finished. Instead her  eyes rolled up in her head and she fainted right on top of the one  asking her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!” Yuuno rushed over to them and lifted up the  girl before Fate fell over as well. “I got her,” He told Fate while  shifting the girl to carry her off the floor. “Wow, you better get  someone to carry you as well, you look like you’re going to pass out  too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She could have at least answered first,” Fate breathed out while Hayate fanned her. “I think I’m going to be sick…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not yet,” Hayate helped her stand and walked with her to the side where everyone was gathering.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Uhm…” Nanoha’s eyes slowly opened, looking up at her best friend. “Yuuno…I had the most wonderful dream just now…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wasn’t a dream,” he smiled and sat her down in a chair. “She’s right here,” He moved to the side, revealing Fate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan!” Nanoha gasped yet again as she recalled what just happened. “I fainted, I’m so sorry!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Its okay,” Fate shifted lightly where she stood, looking down at her. “So…Um…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">All at once Nanoha leapt forward, hugging the girl as tight as she could “YES!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh  thank god,” Fate hugged her back just as hard while almost toppling  over. “You scared the living hell out of me you silly girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry!” She laughed out, hopping in the hug. “You proposed! Hahahaha!”  She hopped a few more times before pulling back and looking down at the  ring case and offering her shaking hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate quickly plucked the ring and slid it over her left ring finger. “Like it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Love it!” Nanoha looked at the ring a moment more before once again hugging her. “How on earth did you set all this up?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I had help.” The blond kissed her fiancée’s forehead.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Guilty,” Suzuka held up her hand. “My family owns this place. Fate-chan called a while ago to get it all together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And everyone is staying at my house while they’re here,” Alisa added in with a grin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alisa-chan,  Suzuka-chan!” Nanoha latched on to them and hugged them both tightly.  “I missed you!” The three shared a small moment together before they  all started talking at once and introducing everyone to each other. The  group quickly made its way outside so they wouldn’t disturb the other  guest and were greeted by the landing of a small dragon, instantly  sending a good portion of the group into a small fit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Freidliche!” Caro ran forward and hugged her dragon. “You said you would stay in the air!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is that!?” Alisa asked, pointing at the summoned beast while hugging Suzuka. “A dragon!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yup!” Caro confirmed happily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh!”  Nanoha walked over to Caro and took her hand, leading her over to  Momoko. “Mom, this is Caro-chan. She’s my un official daughter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello,”  Caro bowed deeply to her. “I’ve wanted to meet you for a while now,”  She smiled up at the woman. “Mommy says you’re very kind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momoko  looked over at Nanoha, who was temporarily looking at her ring again.  “Well,” She spoke down at Caro as she knelt down. “I guess that would  make me your grandmother huh?” She opened her arms. “Come give me a  hug.” Caro complied happily, making Momoko smile. “Welcome to the  family.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Family…” Nanoha whispered, tearing her eyes from her  ring and looking over at Fate. “We’re going to get married and have a  family!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate nodded happily and put a hand on Elio’s shoulder. “With a little boy and girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nyahaha!” Once more she looked down at her ring and repressed a squeal of joy. ‘<em>A new chapter in my life,</em>’ She thought, feeling Fate hug her from behind. ‘<em>I can’t think of any better way to start it.</em>’ Nanoha turned around in the arms and kissed Fate soundly, prompting the entire group to laugh and cheer at them. ‘<em>I love you, Fate!</em>’</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
To be continued…
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha: It was the beginning of a new chapter in our lives. I had  everything; a fiancée, a little girl, the best students anyone could  ask for, all my friends…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate: But just like a river, time keeps flowing. Inevitable battles are coming, questions have to be answered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio: Why am I so susceptible to support magic? Why do dragons give me armor? ...What secrets did my parents hide?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro:  I finally control the power I have deep inside, the power that made me  be outcast from my tribe, the power the military…experimented… with.  Freidliche, tell me! What happened in my past!? Why did you say I’ve  met you before!? …Why was I given this power?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia: Nanoha-san  told me I was picked for this battalion for a reason, something I would  have to discover for myself one day… Tell me, what is it that drew me  here? …My brother always told me, there is no such thing as  coincidence, only the inevitable.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru: I feel a little out of  place lately… Everyone around me has come so far since we started, but  I… have failed. I was beaten up and knocked unconscious; I was too weak  to go on the important missions that followed… I failed to protect my  team… Sub lieutenant Vita! Train me! Help me become stronger! To  protect them! ...To protect <em>her</em>.”</span></p>

Notes: Thus ends the first installment of the “6th Division” storyline
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  following is an added feature and is not part of the story itself;  consider it a very-very long author’s notes, one you don’t need to read  to enjoy the next installment if you don’t want to.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As many of  you could tell, or have known from my previous works of fan fiction,  I’m not shy about slipping in cameo appearances from other series. I  normally add in the more apparent ones at the end of a chapter but  because this story is so long, I thought it would be best to sum up  most of them at the end, as to not interrupt the flow of the story all  that much. The following are most all (I missed a few, probably) of the  Intended References and Cameos. You do not need any prior knowledge to  enjoy them since I changed everything so much, but for those of you who  are interested, here they are.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Mount Fuji’s,” Subaru read the name of the neon sign. “…This is a bar isn’t it?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-Mount  Fuji: Came from Street Fighter 2V, the bar that Ryu and Ken first met  Guile in. It was changed to a night club instead of a small shady bar.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Well  in that case, I’ll whip up something that’ll make her want to come  back!” Haseo gave a short bow to the small girl before executing a  fluid back flip to get back to the head of the table. A pad was tossed  up from the pouch on his waist and a pen followed suit. The items  twirled in the air a moment before being caught. “May I take your  order?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-Haseo: Name and character design taken from .Hack  Roots. Although in the series he’s a PKK (Player Killer Killer) who is  more than a little “psychotic” in this story he plays a playful waiter  who has a tendency to ‘flare’.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Kuhn flipped his long blue ponytail over his shoulder. “I see. Drinks all around?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-Kuhn:  Name, character design, and personality taken from .Hack Roots. In the  series he is a gun wielding Epitath user who fights for everyone. In  this story he is an Earthling running a night club on Mid-childra.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Call her… Skeith.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-Skeith:  Name only taken from the .Hack series. In the series Skeith is a  program used to collect data on different players to see their reaction  to death. He is several stories tall, has a wicked staff and scythe  (depending on game). In Hack GU, he becomes Haseo’s “avatar” and is  used to fight AIDA. In this story, Skeith is a jewel seed bearing the  remains of a broken girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Gently Hanon moved her  chin up so they could look into each other’s eyes. “One day…” The girl  kissed her softly. “You will understand. Don’t let them win, Aura.  Don’t let go of what remains of what they took away. Embrace them.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aura:  Skeith’s human name. Name only taken from the goddess of “The World”.  In the series Aura kept balance in the online game until her  disappearance. In this fanfic the name was given to Skeith’s human form.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Lunch  time, Fate-sempai,” a male by the name of Syaoran poked his head into  her office. “Come on, you’ve been in there non-stop. Stretch your legs  out some.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-Syaoran: Name taken from Card Captor Sakura’s main male character.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Like  I would fall for something like that?” Skeith grinned darkly, making  Signum look down in shock at the bloody arm pressing against her  stomach. “Data Drain!” Several orange beams shot out from Skeith’s  wrist, twirling slowly as red and green hexagons filled the spaces  between them, leaving several places open. “Raising Heart may refuse me  as its master,” She told Signum as a black ball of energy shot into her  stomach. “But that won’t keep me from copying yours!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-Data  Drain: Concept taken from Kite’s bracelet in .Hack Infection. In the  game, Kite uses his bracelet to re-write data around him. In the  process he takes in the data which can ultimately hurt or kill him if  he’s not careful. In the story, Skeith’s Data Drain is incomplete and  faulty, only allowing her to copy data and allow her to ‘phase shift’  with said data (something Kite can’t do). She cannot re-write data nor  does she have a drawback for using it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Give me a daiquiri, a real daiquiri and don’t bring me one of those sissy-fied neon slushies either!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-Quote taken from Deb Duchon, a nutritional anthropologist who regularly appears on the Food Network show “Good Eats.”</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I  see…” The man turned to accept the clipboard of papers. Dark gray hair  hung around his head around a bald spot on top, paired with a mustache  that was equally gray with wisp of white flecking it. “Then I believe  we should neutralize any un-needed emotions before the conversion  process.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-Dr. Wily: The original mad scientist from the old game “Mega Man”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Elio  held onto his spear soundly, eyes glaring over at him while glowing a  deep red. The sound of metal clicking against metal came when he  started calmly walking forward. Silver armor graced his body, much like  a knight from the medieval times. The joints of his knees and elbows  were accented by a point, graced with a golden loop in the tip. The  lack of proper lighting did nothing from keeping the polished armor  from shining, giving accent to the helmet which displayed proudly the  type of knight he was. The helm had dragon fins on the side, as well as  one small horn above the forehead cover, also bearing the small golden  loop in it. His face wasn’t covered, but his cheeks were blessed with a  small silver signals that appeared to be quarter moons with a line  bisecting them horizontally the mark of a dragoon knight.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-Elio’s  Armor: “Dragoon” armor found most commonly in Final Fantasy games. This  type of warrior specializes with a spear and being able to jump  impossible distances into the air. In this story, Elio’s armor reflects  the dragon Caro currently has out (In this case, Freidliche) the way he  summons the armor is unknown to him, although he still has the power to  do so. In the process, Elio makes a pact with the dragons, devoting  himself to their master in return for the armor. Because of this, Elio  calls Caro “Princess Caro” or “Caro-hime” and Caro refers to Elio as  “my dragoon”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Her black knee high winter boots clicked on the floor as she stood next to her girlfriend on the platform. “Beam me up Scotty!”</em></span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  is all I remember right off. I may have missed a few but chances are if  it’s not listed here I either pointed it out earlier or what you’re  thinking I referenced to was completely on accident. The next story  will be made depending on the overall responces this one gets, so if  you're interested in this being continued, lemme know. If you would  prefer shorter stories, say so as well. See you next time.</span></p>
