<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I didn’t really mind  the rain, in fact I rather enjoyed it. The dark clouds over my head  did nothing to bring down my mood as I skated along the sidewalks.  Hayate was so kind to give me special permission to roller blade on  the base grounds while not in training; I would have to thank her  again for it next time I saw her. My pace picked up when I spotted my  pig tailed counter part up ahead of me. With a grin I skated up  behind her and put my arm over her shoulder as I slowed down. At  first she protested fiercely to the contact but after looking around  a moment desperately she reluctantly allowed me to keep my arm there.  Even after all this time she was still too shy to show her emotions  in public, but it didn’t bother me that much. I liked her a lot and  if she wasn’t ready to go public with her sexuality then I could  wait for her. I also looked around a moment to double check  everything before leaning over and giving her a quick peck to the  cheek before I skated ahead a little bit.</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru!” Tia  blushed quickly. “Don’t do that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I made sure nobody  was looking,” She countered happily as she skated backwards. “Don’t  worry!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With that fact  remaining solid, she couldn’t find any other reason to protest the  display of affection. “Still… wait till we’re in our room or  something…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Subaru  stopped skating and allowed her to catch up. “Wait till we’re  alone in our room? How bold!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“N-not like that!”  Tia bopped her girlfriend on the head, face turning red. “You  idiot!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou, you didn’t  have to hit me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Sorry.” She  looked away and crossed her arms. “What are you doing out here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Going to check up on  Nanoha-san, you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Going to see why  Fate hasn’t contacted any of us yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Doesn’t she still  have today on leave?” Subaru pondered aloud as the two walked into  the mess hall on the lower floor of the residential area.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, but she still  should have told us what to expect tomorrow.” Tia pressed the  button to go to the sixth floor in the elevator and waited patiently  for it to bring them up. “I hope they don’t get upset we’re  dropping by so suddenly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Everyone needs a get  well party!” Subaru grinned happily, holding up her fist in a pose.  “A little cheerleading will fix anyone right up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Everyone isn’t so  head strong as to beat off the flu with will power alone like you  are.” Tia walked out the door, leaving Subaru to ponder if that was  an insult or a compliment. The trek to their room was made quickly  and the reddish-orange haired girl pushed the com button next to the  entrance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Who is it?”  Fate’s horse voice asked after a few moments of silence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia looked over at  Subaru a moment before answering. “Tia and Subaru, ma’am”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The com was silent a  moment longer before Fate’s voice came back up, this time sounding  a little better. “Come in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Walking past the now  open door, the two looked around the room in appreciation. “Nice  place,” Subaru thought aloud. “I think it every time we come  here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have to expect it  from two of the three aces of the entire local area base…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello,” Fate  greeted them, walking down the stairs and turning on the lights in  the living room. She had finger combed her hair lightly but it was  still evident that she had just gotten out of bed by the fact that  she was in pajamas. “What brings you two here on your day off?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We came to see if  Nanoha-san was doing any better.” Subaru replied happily as her  rollerblades vanished underneath her to allow the girl to stand  properly in their home.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s asleep right  now,” Fate smiled at them. “But she hasn’t thrown up yet today  so I think it’s a very good improvement.” She left out the fact  that the girl hasn’t even been awake more than five minutes that  day as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-san... Um,  sorry for saying so but… you don’t really look well today.” Tia  gave her superior an apologetic look.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not,  unfortunately.” The blond sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose.  “Nanoha-chan decided to share with me so now I have the flu as  well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ouch,” the girls  both winced at the same time. “Well then,” Subaru continued,  ignoring the amused look on Fate since they had just said the same  thing at the same time. “Where should we report to tomorrow?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno Scrya will be  here to teach you battle formations and tactical advice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry, Ma’am,”  Tia felt her cheeks color a little. “…Who is he?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate smiled. “Chief  librarian of the infinite library and rune explorer. All of our  information on lost logia is sent to him before the main  headquarters.” She decided to make her team appreciate the ferret a  little bit more so she continued. “He’s also the reason  Nanoha-chan and I met.” A flashback made her lips twitch up into a  smile. “Although he was really annoying to me at that time…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I…see…” Subaru  blinked. “Well, okay. We will all report to the training field at  the normal time then?” She received a nod. “In that case we  should probably go so you can rest up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you for  stopping by,” Fate walked them to the door. “I’ll be sure to  tell Nanoha-chan as soon as she wakes up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please do,” Tia  saluted her before leaving the room. Subaru followed shortly after  and the two took the elevator down to the floor beneath them. “Well,  I guess we should go to bed at the usual time then.” She waved her  hand across the scanner to unlock their room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.” Subaru  gripped Mach Caliber in her hand a moment, letting the shoes on her  feet vanish. “What do you want to do for the rest of the day? It  will probably rain soon so we need to stay in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia looked out their  window up at the black sky. “Spring showers bring May flowers I  guess…” Looking back over at her room-mate, she shrugged before  falling onto her bed. “I guess we can just rest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ehhh? That’s  boring!” Subaru walked over to her and put her hands on her hips.  “Let’s do <em>something</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like what?” Tia  laid on her bed, closed her eyes, and put her hands behind her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Oh I don’t  know…” Subaru’s voice suddenly became lighter and more playful.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia found her bed shift  lightly and when she opened her eyes she found the blue haired girl  crawling on top of her with a happy smile on her face. “Su-Subaru?”  She stammered out, blushing. “Get off me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t wanna…”  She gripped the hands that moved to push her off and interlaced their  fingers before pinning them above the head of the girl beneath her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia looked at her a  moment before she realized just what was going through her  girlfriend’s mind. “It’s still day time…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It doesn’t  matter,” She leaned down and started kissing her neck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru…” She  tried to move her hands but found them still pinned. “You’re  embarrassing me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry,  Tia-chan.” She cooed softly, nibbling on the girl’s earlobe.  “Should I stop?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…No…” She  embraced their hands together and moved to try and kiss her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey… call me that  again?” Subaru avoided her lips and instead went back to her  shoulder, nipping lightly at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wha-what?” Tia  flushed. “That’s embarrassing…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay,” She  insisted, moving up to suck on the soft spot on her neck and leaving  a small hickey there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiss me…” The  reddish-orange haired girl tried once again to move so their lips  would touch, disappointed when her girlfriend moved again. “Stop  teasing me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then say it?”  Subaru touched their foreheads together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou…” The girl  looked at her a moment longer before moving her eyes away and letting  her cheeks get darker. “Kiss me…Su-chan?” The pet name got a  happy response and soon she found her lover’s lips on top of hers.  Moments passed slowly as the two made out, hands shyly exploring each  other’s bodies. Subaru was the first to make the most daring  approach, running her hand along Tia’s thigh and allowing her  fingers to slip under her miniskirt to touch the light fabric of her  panties. “Be gentle…” she got a light giggle in reply before  her lips were claimed in a soft kiss once more.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Nggghnn…” Nanoha  moaned out and rolled on her back. “I don’t want to be in bed  anymore…”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right now I don’t  want to be anywhere <em>but</em> bed,” Fate replied sleepily as she  opened her eyes and looked at her friend. “How do you feel?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like hell,” Nanoha  moved over to lay on Fate’s chest but found the girl stopping her  before she could. “No?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not right now,”  Fate shook her head and brought one hand up to rub her forehead. “I  don’t feel so hot…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Did I get you  sick?” Her voice was a little scared, but she obviously already  knew the answer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I got myself sick,”  The blond replied as she reached out to hold hands. “I shouldn’t  have kissed you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We kissed?” Nanoha  held her friend’s hand with one of hers and used her other to rub  her eyes. “…Oh yeah, we did… twice. I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t apologize,”  Fate coughed a little. “It was worth it.” She knew she had just  admitted her feelings to the girl but under the medication she was on  and the fever she currently had, she didn’t really mind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All the same, I’m  sorry.” She crawled over to Fate once again and hugged her. “I  hope you don’t get it as bad as I do…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I won’t, don’t  worry.” Fate accepted the hug and allowed Nanoha to put her back  against her front. “I don’t stay sick long at all, three days and  I’ll be good as new.” She laid an arm over the girl’s waist and  cuddled. “I’ll still take care of you, so whatever you want, just  ask okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No buts…” Fate  took a steadying breath and ignored her sweating body trying to  demand her to push Nanoha away so she could cool off. “Nanoha is  mine; I’ll take care of her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl didn’t reply  at first, just simply rubbed the hand that was around her. Finally  after a minute or two she brought the hand up to her mouth and kissed  the palm. “Okay. I’m yours, Fate-chan. Please take care of me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Always.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And let me take care  of you too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And in time, let me  love you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only if you let me  love you too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Always,” Nanoha  looked at the palm in front of her and gave another gentle kiss on it  before bringing it to her chest and placing it over her heart.  “…Always, and forever.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Elio looked around  while sitting at the training field. Wind blew around him lightly,  making the hot humid air more tolerable. Already he had ran a mile  that morning to loosen up his muscles and just finished up a few more  stretches to ensure that he would be all right after a few days off  of training. Currently he was alone, but he didn’t mind since he  was early. The sun was just barely coming up now, casting an orange  glow around him while he waited. “You’re up early, huh?” a  voice made him turn around quickly.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Yuuno-san!”  Elio saluted him promptly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wow, you’ve gotten  big.” Yuuno ruffled the boy’s hair. “Last time I saw you, you  were this tall!” He held his hand at about Elio’s shoulder level.  “You’ve grown quite a bit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve gotten a lot  stronger too,” He added in to the compliments. “I’ll show you  once Fate gets here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She won’t be  coming,” He informed with a lopsided smile. “Fate got sick along  with Nanoha, so they called me in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio blinked. “Oh.  Okay then, you’re going to be training us?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’m not a  combat mage, so there’s nothing I can train you on in battle. I  can, however, improve what you already know.” Yuuno reached into  his shirt and pulled out Raising Heart. “I already stopped by  Nanoha’s loft and picked up R.H. to record the information… want  to get started while we wait for the others?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sir!” Elio  saluted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well then…Raising  Heart Excelion!” Yuuno flicked the gem into the air and held out  his hands. “Change user: Yuuno Scrya!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“User accepted.”  Raising Heart confirmed as it floated in the air. “Please update  Barrier Jacket and Device.” Yuuno closed his eyes a moment.  “…Accepted.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno’s clothes  shattered around him, flaring his long hair out behind him as it did  so. In a flash, the boy was given something akin to blue jeans,  hanging loose around his legs. Brown hiking shoes graced his feet,  amplified by sharp angle silver armor pieces. Moving up his body, the  magic engulfed his chest and revealed a dark green tank top. More  armor appeared in the form of a jean jacket that only came down to  mid-stomach but covered his arms to the wrist, where they were lined  in a matching silver. As the transformation ended, Raising Heart  started to change as well, moving the materials available to form  herself into a thick book, which was taken by the male. “Right.”  Yuuno looked at his Barrier Jacket a moment to get the feel of it.  “Not to shabby for a spur of the moment decision.” The book in  his hand opened up almost to the middle. “Let’s see here… Elio  Mondial… Got you.” He closed the book and grinned. “I now know  all of the data that your device has stored.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You read all that  information already!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m a librarian,”  He tapped his temple. “Sucking information up quickly is what I  live for. Now,” He smiled and held up a small silver bell and  jingled it. “Your specialty is speed, right? Then your mission is  to get this bell from me by any means possible.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re that  fast!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh no!” Yuuno  laughed. “You’re way faster than me probably.” His lips stayed  in a smile. “What I want you to learn from this is that speed isn’t  everything… there are things you must know that will allow someone  even slower than you to move in a way where you can’t beat them.”  Several displays appeared around them and Yuuno quickly made the  imitation city appear behind them. “Shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio held up his hand  and summoned forth Strada. “Ready!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Mou, we’re late!”  Tia cried out desperately as they ran down the sidewalk towards the  training field. “And with a new teacher too! Subaru, I’m blaming  you for this!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re the one who  told me to be gentle!” She countered as she glided next to her  friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I said gentle, not  six hours! I can’t believe we overslept!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ahh! They’ve  already started!” The two girls ran faster, trying to get to the  field before anymore time slipped by them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning,”  Caro greeted them nervously. “This is our instructor for the next  few days,” She pointed upwards to the monitor that showed Yuuno  reading the book form of Raising Heart while dodging Elio’s attacks  as if they were nothing. “Elio seems to be targeting the small  silver bell on Instructor Yuuno’s belt.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh wow,” Subaru  gasped out, amazed at how easily her squad member was being toyed  with. “What is he an S, S+ mage?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“AA,” Caro replied  as she brought up a display about Yuuno. “He is a support mage so  he’s not the best for individual combat. Elio-kun is faster than  him but for some reason…” She motioned back to the battle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio paused his  onslaught and panted, glaring at the man in front of him who had one  hand in his pocket while casually reading the remodeled Raising  Heart. ‘<em>Is it his device?’</em> he pondered while catching his  breath. ‘<em>That’s Nanoha-san’s weapon but he originally had  it…Maybe he can use powers on it that Nanoha-san can’t?... No,  that’s not it… if anything he isn’t even using it at twenty  percent of its power… Then what is it? His own power?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tired?” Yuuno  looked up from reading. “Want to call it quits?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!” Elio dashed  forward again. ‘<em>The book has all my information on it so he has  to be using it to predict my moves!</em>’ He slung his spear quickly  and stabbed forward at an alarming speed. The long haired male simply  danced to the side and moved his body around the thrust. Elio’s  fingertips almost reached towards the man’s waist but found him  quickly taking to the air to avoid the contact. “He can even fly…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio!” Yuuno  called down happily at him. “What did I tell you at the beginning  of all this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The red head though  about it. “Even if an opponent is slower, they can still beat my  best moves…What does it mean!?” Elio gripped his spear tighter.  ‘<em>That’s it!</em>’ His eyes glared back up at his target.  ‘<em>He’s using tactical strategies against me! Just like me once  I see an attack once, I won’t fall for it again… he’s seen  countless battles alongside Nanoha and in text books!’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno grinned at him.  ‘<em>He’s figuring it out… I’ll have to be careful from now on  or I’ll lose my bell.</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Something I’ve  never done… something I’ve never done…</em>’ His eyes darted  around. ‘<em>There!</em>’ Dashing forward he ran alongside the  building. “Sonic move!” His feet blurred and the world seemed to  freeze around him, allowing the boy to run up the side of the  building.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Seen it,” Yuuno  whispered to himself while flying to the side. “You can’t jump  this far.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wing road!” Elio  kicked off the building. ‘<em>I’m moving too fast for the road to  form so I’ll have to…</em>’ He smirked at Yuuno’s surprised  expression. The blue magic formed beneath him, moving much too slow  for him to run along. When his feet landed against it, he immediately  jumped again. “New Skill!” He exclaimed, reaching up to grab his  prize. “Double jump!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The silver bell jingled  against his hand just a moment before he gripped it and tugged. Yuuno  grabbed the boy along the waist and caught him next, laughing as they  spun form the force of it. “And how were you planning on landing?”  He mused, looking at the building right in front of him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh!? Um…” He  flushed, not even thinking about it. “Rebound off the wall and fall  several stories?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds painful.”  Yuuno flew over to the observation deck where the others were  waiting. “Good morning,” He greeted, setting his friend down and  saluting the other three. “My name is Yuuno Scrya, I’ll be your  instructor for tactical strategies until Nanoha or Fate can pick back  up. Maybe Vita if she comes back from her mission.” He looked down  at Caro, who immediately saluted him. “Caro-san, I trust you  learned something from watching?” He got a nod so he turned his  attention to the two older members. “And you two, why were you  late?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“H-how did you  know!?” Subaru blurted out, getting pinched by Tia to calm her  outburst.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry, sir!” Tia  saluted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, you two.” He  held up Raising Heart and let it glow a moment before looking down  and flipping through the pages at an incredible speed. “Got it. You  two will come at me together. The goal is to land a solid hit on me.  Be warned, I will fight back this time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sir!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha looked up from  her place lying on the couch when Fate sat down in front of her. The  girl placed two bowls of soup on the coffee table and pulled it  closer to them. “Thanks,” She managed out as she also slid down  to the floor.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry it’s not  home made, but it’s the best I could do.” Fate coughed a little  and rubbed her throat. “Does your throat hurt really badly?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I got used to it  after dry heaving all day.” Nanoha sat by her friend an took her  hand, pleased to find out that since she was left handed they could  still eat properly while continuing the small act of affection. “How  are you feeling?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ugh, it’s only  still just hitting me and I want to curl up and die.” She sniffed  and coughed again. “I don’t feel sick to my stomach as much as my  head wants to explode…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw, there-there.”  Nanoha squeezed her hand gently. “A few days and we’ll be good as  new.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And when we’re  better what should we do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fiery love-love.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate coughed while  trying to eat a spoonful of soup and had to wipe her mouth off before  looking over at her. “Nanoha-chan!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smiled. “I got my  sense of humor back already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou…” Fate  looked down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Get your hopes up?”  Nanoha leaned over against her playfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe,” Fate  smiled back at her, not really caring if she admitted it or not  anymore.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The brown haired girl  leaned over more, making Fate tip over onto the floor. “The soup  needs to cool down…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It does,” She  agreed, wrapping her arms around her girlfriend’s neck. “We’re  both sick anyway…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes we are…”  Leaning over, Nanoha began to kiss her sweetly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Five minutes into the  activity Nanoha pulled back and sat up, panting heavily and holding a  hand to her chest. “Okay… Got to…. Stop….Before I … Throw  up again…” She looked at her with regret. “Sorry Fate-chan…  I’m getting too hot…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay…”  Fate sat up as well and fixed her shirt. “I couldn’t breathe  either…” She sniffed heavily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh gross, I thought  that was slobber…” Nanoha wiped her face off on her shirt sleeve.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou, don’t say  that!” Fate blushed darkly. “At least I didn’t throw up on  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You said you’d  never bring that up again!” Nanoha pouted at her. “I felt really,<em> really</em> bad!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two girls looked at  each other a moment before slowly breaking into light laughter. “Ow…”  Fate giggled, holding her head. “Don’t make me laugh, it hurts…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry Fate-chan.”  Nanoha waited her them both to calm down before going back to her  soup and sipping it. “Mmmm, just the right time to eat it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How do you think our  squad is doing?” Fate pondered aloud as she drank some water.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno-kun came by  when you were asleep and got Raising Heart from me, he said he was  just going to try and make them cover their weaknesses.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Fate  propped herself up by placing her cheek against her hand and leaning  on the table. “I wonder how they’re doing right now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno probably has  his nose stuck in a book,” Nanoha giggled to herself.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Yuuno smiled to himself  as he flew backwards in the air from the force of the blast that had  just collided with the front of his barrier. Just as he suspected, a  follow up came from the side, where Tia was aiming her dual pistols  at him. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Outstanding teamwork,</span></em>’ he mused while lifting his  fingers to activate some more magic. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There are only a few  openings I see that need to be exploited…</span></em>’
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia gasped when small  green chains erupted from the ground around her, instantly gripping  her body. Before she knew what was happening her pistols were robbed  from her and she was hung in the air behind Yuuno. “Well now,”  Yuuno called out to Subaru, who was looking dumbstruck. “I have  your partner, now what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Tia, can you  break free?</em>” Subaru narrowed her eyes and waited a moment.  “<em>Tia?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Telepathy won’t  work,” The blond man informed the two as he hovered in the air.  “I’ve placed a shield around her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s cheap!”  Tia accused as she struggled. Moments passed before she cried out in  pain. “Hey, what is this!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Black Vice,” Yuuno  informed. “The more you struggle the harder you will be gripped. If  you move recklessly you will end up suffocating yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a little  much, don’t you think?” Subaru shouted out angrily at the man.  “Even Nanoha-san isn’t this brutal!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then you better land  a blow on me before she makes the binds too tight then, huh?” Yuuno  smirked at her. ‘<em>Your temper is your main problem,</em>’ he  mused as the girls took a moment to soak in the situation. ‘<em>There’s  no way I’d let them really get hurt, but as long as she doesn’t  realize this I’ll be able to make her really pissed off…and  then,</em>’ He looked over at Tia, who was carefully testing the  binding power of the chains. ‘<em>It’ll be up to her.</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let her go!”  Subaru screamed, forming her wing road and engaging once again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Make me!” Yuuno  shifted all of his shields directly in front of him, smirking. Subaru  punched the first shield as hard as she could, loaded two cartridges  and made the magic circle flicker under the stress. Before it broke  completely Yuuno thrust his hand forward, making all of his shields  slam into one and launch the girl backwards. “That all you have!?”  He taunted with a laugh. The words worked liked he had hoped and the  girl yelled out again, once more charging.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>This isn’t  going to work,</em>’ Tia thought to herself, looking around. ‘<em>These  chains tighten even if I flinch…at this rate I’ll be crushed…’</em> Her eyes watched her partner cough out after being slammed through a  building. Once more she launched forward, blasting Yuuno’s shields  with everything she had. ‘<em>Subaru, you idiot! There’s no way  you can break through even one of those, let alone all of them! That  bastard has probably five shields all focused... wait!’</em> Her  mouth dropped lightly. It was as clear as day what was going on from  her angle but knew that Subaru was too preoccupied to notice it.  Yuuno had all of his shields directly in front of him, making a clear  half sphere of complete immunity in front of his body. “Subaru!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kinda busy!” She  replied harshly, kicking and punching the shields only to be thrown  back again and slide down her wing road.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You idiot, listen to  me! He has-!” Her words caught in her throat when Yuuno’s eyes  met hers and one of his shields flashed around to cover his back.  When she didn’t say anything else, the shield went back to the  front. ‘<em>He’s doing it on purpose…</em>’ Tia swallowed  thickly as her partner continued to go all out, burning with a fire  from Yuuno’s constant taunting. ‘<em>He’s trying to encourage us  to make the right move… But How…</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru spit out a  little blood from the cut on her lip and glared. “Stop hiding  behind those shields and fight me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I like my  shields,” he protested, slipping one hand in his pocket and  bringing up a book in his other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>What’s that?</em>’  Subaru instantly got defensive. ‘<em>An arcane tome? An ancient  magical relic? A spell book!? Raising Heart?!’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This?” Yuuno  looked at her as if he could read her thoughts. “This is just a  book… I want to see how it ends.” He went back to reading.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You… Pay attention  to me!” Subaru once again skated up the wing road and roared,  blasting the shield with her revolver knuckle and finally making it  weak enough to break. Once through, she punched again, getting shot  back harshly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Reflect shield,”  Yuuno mused, turning a page. “Better be careful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia swallowed. ‘<em>She  can’t take much more…</em>’ Her eyes closed as she thought a  moment. ‘<em>Her anger is making her only see what’s in front of  her and not what’s around her…</em>’ Her eyes opened quickly as  an idea flew through her head. “Subaru!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia saw Yuuno’s ear  twitch lightly. “You can’t see the forest because of all the  trees!” She moved slightly, wincing as the chains tightened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…<em>What</em>!?”  She gaped at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia watched Yuuno a  moment, but his attention went back to the book when he decided that  those words were acceptable to him. “You can’t see the forest  because of all the trees!” She repeated the advice, adding in a  wink to show that she meant it at something more than face value.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>What does she  mean…?</em>’ Subaru skated in front of the man slowly. ‘<em>If I  see the trees then I obviously see the forest…So how could the  trees keep me from seeing it…?</em>’ Just to make sure Yuuno was  still serious she shot a weak magical blast at him and dodged it when  it was reflected back. ‘<em>Trees… Trees…His barriers! They’re  the trees! So what’s the forest…?</em>’ Her eyes scanned the  area, finally resting on the windows of an office building. The sun’s  light made them all slightly white, reflecting the area around them  and giving her a clean view of her opponent. ‘<em>That’s it! I  couldn’t see the barrier’s range because all I could see were the  barriers! They’re only covering his front!’</em> Her lips twisted  up into a smile. “Load cartridge!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno smiled to himself  as the attack against him was charged up. “Divine…!” Subaru  reared back her fist. “Buster!” She launched the attack as close  as she dared since the range was relatively short. The attack shot  underneath the man and Subaru gripped her fist, concentrating hard.  With a sharp tug, she ripped her hand backwards, making the attack  change directions and fly towards Yuuno’s back. A flash of light  blinded them all for a moment and when it cleared, Yuuno was still  where he stood, only now his hair was flowing loosely around him,  ponytail holder decimated.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Match over,” He  admitted, recalling his binds holding Tia and letting Subaru catch  her. “Good job!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You okay Tia?”  Subaru whispered softly down at her friend, looking at the slight red  lines across her exposed skin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, fine.” She  hopped from her arms and onto the wing road, looking at Yuuno as he  flew towards them. “What was the point of all this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You,” he pointed  at Subaru. “Have a temper that blinds you to things that others can  see. Although you’re plenty powerful, sometimes you need to take a  breath and calm down. Your leaders won’t always be able to tell you  what to do, and when they do they will use a type of code that you  will need to figure out on your own, lest your opponents realize  their mistake.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Subaru  nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you, Tia.”  Yuuno looked over at the other girl. “Don’t rely enough on other  people. The marks on your body are light right now, but if it was,  say, Caro out there instead of Subaru, I’m willing to bet you’d  be pretty badly bruised right now.” He held out his hand and  started to treat the wounds the two had received. “If you don’t  stop and admit to yourself that you need someone else, they will be  gone before you know it and you’ll be alone to always wonder what  happened. Your pride blinds <em>you</em> to accept that you aren’t  perfect, that it’s okay to open up to someone and let them be there  for you.” He smiled. “I chose that bind to try and make you  realize that sometimes you <em>do</em> need others to help you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Okay,” Tia  looked over at Subaru, who was too interested in Yuuno’s healing  ability to return the glance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That concludes  today’s lesson” Yuuno told the group as they all landed on the  observation deck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But what about  Caro?” Elio asked, looking over at his pink haired counter part.  “Are you not going to do anything with her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro’s training  started the moment she got here,” Yuuno informed him with a grin.  “Caro, did you learn a lot?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes sir!” She  nodded. “Can I ask you about a few of them later? The binding magic  was too powerful for me to break down.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course,” The  older male grinned. “Besides that, did you manage to dissect my  spells? Think you will be able to cast them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes sir!” She  saluted him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I want each of you  to think about what you learned today and be prepare a counter  strategy and a type of coding that only you know incase it ever  happens again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean we’re not  going to practice again later today?” Caro asked, disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m a librarian,  not a fighter,” He reminded them. “I want you to know yourselves  and your weaknesses, through that you will become stronger than any  physical training will ever give you. Dismissed!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia watched her three  friends talk for just a moment before they started to go in their  separate ways. Yuuno’s words came back to her mind, making her grip  her fist. “Hey, Subaru!” She called out, making the people around  turn and look at her. ‘<em>If I don’t admit that I need someone,  they may end up leaving me…</em>’ She swallowed lightly. “Do you  want to get a bite to eat or something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh? Sure, I guess  I’m hungry. Should we all go somewhere and-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia cut her off. “No!”  Her cheeks colored a little. “I mean just you and me… like a  date…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A date?” Subaru  blinked, feeling the eyes of the others on her. A few moments passed  by her as the words sank in. “Yeah. Yeah! I’d love to go on a  date with you!” She skated over to the girl and took her hand.  “Come on!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“H-hey!” Tia ran a  few steps to keep up, not looking at the smiling people looking at  her. “Not so fast you dork!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not ‘dork’!  Call me by my pet name again!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!”</span></p>

To be concluded...
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fun Facts:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-Tia's  &quot;love-love mode&quot; mood was given to her because: &quot;The quiet girls are  always wild in bed&quot; and &quot;The wild girls are always quiet in bed&quot;...so  since Tia is always snappy and easily angered, I thought that her being  a secret romantic would be a nice flare to her personality. To back it  up, I'll point out that in one episode Subaru said to Tia &quot;When you  voice your insecurities, you're really thinking the opposet&quot; and even  though her words were like that, Subaru knew that Tia really just  wanted encouragement from her. So with that, I made Tia act tough on  the outside but be a softy when she was alone with Subaru. Sorry if you  don't like it, but I think it's cute : D</span></p>
