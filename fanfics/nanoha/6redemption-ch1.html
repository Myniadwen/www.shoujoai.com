<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I smiled to  myself as I hummed along to one of my favorite songs being played on  the radio. I was in a really good mood today since most of my schedule  was put off thanks to some higher ups coming and giving the base a  one-over to make sure we were all on the top of our jobs. My training  field was the first to be inspected and I was given high marks for my  teaching methods as well as the level of improvement that my forwards  were showing. Tia managed to hover a few inches off the ground for  almost a minute and that really earned me some brownie points because  she was only a B-ranked mage. Caro and Lutecia's summons also earned me  high praise, as well as Subaru's ability to break through barriers and  handle close-combat. Elio, amazingly, easily summoned armor both from  Lutecia and Caro and when inspected his magical powers had gone almost  to double-A standards. Fortunately the investigator didn't know of the  massive drain it put on the girls so all-in-all I was almost guaranteed  to win the “Teacher of the Year” award coming up in the winter months  we were now facing. A small beeping sound made me jog back into the  kitchen and pull out the racks of cookies from the oven. Now that I had  dessert out and cooling I checked the rest of the dinner and noticed in  satisfaction that by the time the carry-over heat was finished cooking  Fate would be home. On that note I still had a while to kill so I  grabbed a hot cookie and nibbled it carefully while walking around the  wall and to the stairs leading to our bedroom. Kneeling down I reached  under the bed and pulled out my violin case and opened the latches with  two small clicking sounds. The polished instrument greeted me with a  shine and I couldn't help but grin at the memory of my two best friends  on Earth giving it to me as a congratulations on getting engaged.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>6th Mobile Division: Redemption </strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By:</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate looked at the approaching door with a feeling of relief. '<em>finally,</em>' She thought to herself as she walked to her home.'<em>Talk  about a stressful day. Every single piece of my subordinates, direct or  indirect, were given hell and I had to take responsibility for it.</em>'  The passage into her loft was revealed and as she stepped through the  door, a mouth watering scent hitting her nose. Along with the treat of  smelling dinner waiting on her, a very happy and upbeat song was being  played on Nanoha's violin. Without a word she took her shoes off, lined  them up beside the door, and straightened Nanoha's carelessly discarded  boots. Her partner was currently wearing her white long sleeve button  up shirt that only had the middle buttons done as well as her blue  instructor skirt. With a content grin Fate crossed her arms and leaned  against the door frame, happy at the chance to watch Nanoha act a fool.  She was skipping around the living room, sliding on her socks, while  playing her violin in the most carefree manor. Eyes closed, she easily  danced around the furniture as she twirled, slashing her bow across the  strings quickly to create the peppy song. Not noticing Fate yet, she  started to sing out:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well before you know it she is born, she's  looking up through painted bars, and she hears a hairy stranger say  “She'll learn to play the violin!” Her mother's voice is high and  sweet, she's got her chin and rosy cheeks, and before this birdy leaves  the nest she'll learn to play the violin!” Dancing around again, Nanoha  laughed happily, dipping down and leaning back all while keeping up the  fast paced song. “Now her baby shoes are obsolete, she's growing like  an ivy-weed, and every day she hears her father say “She'll play the  violin!” Her mother and Fate won't interfere, they'll give me room, Let  me steer, but they won't be happy 'til they hear me learn to play the  fiddle!” Turning around once more she opened her eyes and laughed  again, only stopping when she noticed that Fate was watching her. With  a dark blush she slowed down and offered her room mate an embarrassed  smile. “Nya haha... I guess I got carried away...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't  recall my name being in that song,” She teased her as she walked into  the house fully. “I'm sorry I'm so late coming home today.” Fate made  her way into the kitchen and looked at the different pots and pans  littering the stove and counter tops. “I see you made dinner?” A happy  hum confirmed the obvious question while she observed the dishes. “Wow,  roast chicken and veggies! Did you make the smashed potatoes from  scratch?” She felt Nanoha's arms wrap around her waist and a small nod.  “I'm impressed. A salad too! Wow, you went all out, you never cut  things for salad.” Her eyes trailed more. “Even made croissants.” Fate  put her hands on top of her fiancé's. “Nanoha, have I told you lately  that I love you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The way to a girl's heart really is through  her stomach, huh?” She teased, poking Fate's side and getting a small  giggle. “You always cook for me so I thought I'd return the favor since  I had time off. It won't be as good as yours but I tried really hard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm  sure it's lovely,” The blond reached up to get some plates down while  Nanoha still held onto her. “...Wait a tic, did you just say you had  time off?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,” She took the offered plate after finally letting  go of her. “The people inspecting interrupted everyone's flow so after  about half the day my schedule was more or less canceled so I gave the  forwards their last training session off and told them to do a few laps  before calling it a day. Why, did your day not go so easy? Didn't get  in trouble or anything did you?” Nanoha started loading her plate while  waiting for her lover to answer. After they both sat down Fate finally  sighed out and started talking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was hard. Since I am head  enforcer I am more or less responsible for everyone's mistakes. I  should keep a tighter leash on them or something, they found girly  magazines in the break room and one of the office floors wasn't really  clean. Although I didn't get punished or reprimed for it, I was still  scolded for allowing the people under me to work in such a loose  environment. For now on I'm going to have to check on them personally  once a week or so. As if my schedule wasn't already packed enough as it  is...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry I can't help, since Yuuno-kun started looking  around for more people to train, I'm going to have my hands full.” She  started eating her dinner while thinking it over. “Starting next month  the normal rooms on the second and third floors are going to be filled  with people for a kind of boot camp for the police forces around here.  They will use my training field three times a day while I'm not on it,  but I'm still going to have to check on them every now and then to be  sure it's going as planned. Although they rank as F, D, and the  occasional C Mages they still need to be trained properly to protect  the people of the city... Maybe I should help the new teachers until  they are used to things here...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate drank a small sip of wine  and smiled. “Section Six sure has come a long way in just a year, huh?  Remember our first day? The only rooms taken were ours, three forwards,  and Hayate's. Everyone else had rooms on the rest of the base and just  commute to our section. Now half the forward rooms are full and all of  the regular rooms will be jam packed as well... and we're just about in  charge of it all... Wow, I never sat and thought about it...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Our  mothers must be really proud.” Nanoha laughed at the situation. “Well,  my parents really don't understand exactly what we do but they can at  least appreciate my rank compared to the Earth ones. Oh! Speaking of, I  don't want to go years without seeing them again so I'm thinking of  requesting an Earth leave for a day or so every few months, or maybe if  I'm lucky I can bring them here. They've wanted to see another planet  for years...” She took a large mouthful of her salad and chewed it  happily. “Do you think Hayate can get permission for inter-planet  communication and passports?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That's a mighty large request, you  know non-administrated planet transportation is highly frowned upon. If  it wasn't for his military background and our support, Kuhn wouldn't be  able to transport from Earth.” Seeing Nanoha's face fall she quickly  changed her tone. “But you never know! Maybe we can pull something,  after all Mom still has the apartment there and uses it as a summer  home... Come to think of it, it's summertime on Earth right now isn't  it? Since it's winter here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha thought. “Well Midchilda has  longer seasons than Earth sooo... Well, yes, actually. I think it  should be dead-middle of summer time there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmmm...” Fate  leaned back in her chair, happily content and full. “Very lovely  dinner, Nanoha.” She smiled at the cute giggle she got in reply. Her  eyes turned to the window and looked out at the dark night sky. “The  days are shorter lately, and it's been so peaceful. Illegal logia  trading has slowed down to a crawl after Jail's death spread around and  the few Relics we have come across have been easily obtained... Say,  Nanoha? Wouldn't now be a good time to rank-up? All of us, the forwards  too.” Nanoha put her hand to her chin in thought to the question.  “Lutecia needs to be classified officially anyway since she joined the  team; her record is completely blank now. I think they're ready, what  do you say?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The brown haired girl smiled to herself. “Yeah,  they're ready. I'll talk to them about it tomorrow, could you handle  the preparations for me, Captain Fate?” She saluted playfully. “We can  take ours after they do, if it's okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure thing, sweetheart.”  She covered an amused smile. “But don't salute with your fork in your  hands.” Nanoha yelped out and quickly placed it on her plate, blushing  darkly. “Hehe, you never change.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Rank  up?” Subaru repeated the words to herself to get a taste for them. Her  eyes trailed over to Tia's which were looking at her as well. “Tia and  I took the test for B-rank not too long ago and we originally failed...  Wouldn't it be best if we waited a while more before trying at a higher  rank?” She had completely forgotten that the time for the optional test  were coming up again. “How long would we have to prepare?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A month,”  Nanoha informed them. She looked around the peaceful forest area  training ground they were in and smiled at the serenity of it. Despite  having just suffered from a large scale mock battle the area still made  her feel at ease thanks to the cool air and sun shining down to warm  them up from it. “I won't force anyone to take the test except for  Lutecia.” The woman looked down at the surprised purple haired girl.  “You have to be officially ranked; don't worry it will be simple for  you, anything over an A rank is a mock battle one on one with a higher  ranked mage. You might even fight me or Fate, so be sure to use  everything at your disposal okay?” She got a curt nod that quickly  changed to a salute. “You'll get used to the private rank soon too.”  Nanoha giggled a moment before popping her fist onto her palm in  realization. “Oh yeah, whoever ranks up mage-wise will also be promoted  military-wise as well. This will increase your pay also, so it's  something to really consider.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mommy,” Caro raised her hand a  little to get attention. “Are you going to take the test as well?” The  question made everyone turn to their instructor expectingly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,”  She nodded. “Fate and I are going to try for SS-rank. It's been almost  three years since we became S-rank so I think we will have improved  enough to pass. My phase shifting has been classified as a rare-ability  so that's an edge already. Caro-chan, your summons will also aid you,  and Elio you armor will also give you a boost. Tia you can already  hover so your magical power alone will almost be enough to get you  ranked. Subaru, you have some of the best fighting skills I've seen so  you too are close. Don't let it get to your head, though, you'll still  need to prepare extra hard for this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia spoke up softly,  making Nanoha turn to listen to her. “What rank should I apply for?”  She had a rare ability summon already, as well as short/long range  single/mass teleportation. Even without her insects she held her own  against both Tia and Subaru during the mock battle as well. “A? Double  A?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The teacher thought it over. “Well your rare abilities may  push you to triple-A, but you don't have the magical energy to support  it, and you're still inexperienced despite everything you've gone  through. I'd recommend trying for AA for now and maybe going for  Triple-A next year or the year after.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia sighed at the information. '<em>And  here I was, thinking I'm the leader of this small group when the  teachers aren't around and Lutecia blows me right out of the water...</em>'  She gripped her pistol tightly while everyone started talking about the  tests. Nanoha dismissed their first training session of the day but she  still stayed where she was. Standing silently, she glared at the ground  in her own frustration. '<em> I have to become more powerful... First  Subaru and then Elio and now Lutecia... all of them can do things I  can't. If Nanoha-san is correct and I really do hold a bunch of latent  magical power, what can I do to release it? I'm not using twenty  percent of Cross Mirage's capability, there has to be something!'</em> She heard her name being called, making her look up and around,  realizing for the first time that she should have left already. Nanoha  was in front of her, leaned over slightly to match their eye level. Her  teacher smiled inquisitively, making Tia blush. “Oh... Sorry, my mind  wandered off...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Something is troubling you,” Nanoha spoke her  mind easily. “I can tell, you always furrow your brow when you're  upset. Do you want to talk about it? It's about the test isn't it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  entirely...” The girl let out a small sigh. “I just feel that lately...  I've become a burden to everyone. During the Skeith incident I couldn't  even enter the battle field... Against Jail I couldn't even fight... In  times of emergency I was always being protected... Is there nothing I  can do?” She looked up at Nanoha, clearly upset at herself.  “Nanoha-san! We have the same position! I try as hard as I can! Why is  it you can do everything and I can't!? Is it your power? Am I really  that weak!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha softened at the outbreak rather than looked  surprised at it. “Tia,” Her words were gentle, placing a hand onto the  girl's shoulder. “It's not true that everyone starts out the same. I  was gifted with my power, that's all. I tried as hard as I could during  my missions and my trainings, often sleeping for only three hours a  night for months on end. Although I started very high and pushed myself  to my limits countless times, I only increased my rank once. Nine  years, Tia, I've been doing this for nine long years. It isn't about  your mage rank, it's about yourself. How you handle a battle, how you  think, how you react, how you feel. All of that makes a great warrior,  a 'Striker'. You know that term don't you?” The gunslinger shook her  head softly so she went into detail. “A Striker is someone who is  always depended upon, someone who can turn the tide on a hopeless war,  someone who can make even the most depressed and scared warrior fight  at their full potential. Someone who starts out just like you, always  wanting more, always seeking to protect others, always trying their  best.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia met Nanoha's eyes again. “Me?” She asked, unsure of  herself. “But I don't have a rare ability, nor can I do many other  things. I have my illusion magic but it's just 'uncommon' not 'rare'.  Could someone like me really be a Striker?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you <em>want</em> to be one, Tia?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Yes.”  Tia nodded to herself. “I just need guidance... I need someone to show  me the way, so I won't lose myself.” Her hands tightened around her  gun. “I want Cross Mirage to appreciate me the way I do him.” She  looked up at Nanoha with a fierce determination. “I want <em>them</em> to look up at me, to see me as a leader! I want to become strong!  Strong enough to be able to adapt to the situation, just like you said!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha smiled. “Do you know my nickname? The one that I like?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...No?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Multi-weapon.”  Nanoha reached down to Tia's hand and lifted it up with Cross Mirage.  “May I?” She got a small nod and found the fingers releasing. “Thank  you.” Looking at the handgun, she gave it a greeting. “Hello, Cross  Mirage, may I use you as an example?” Despite having the required  authority to release it's power she asked anyway to be polite to the AI  that wasn't hers. After getting a confirmation she held it out at arm's  length. “Stage one: Pistol.” She shot a tree across from them. “Stage  two: Dual Pistol.” Another gun formed in her off-hand and she shot the  tree a few times with each one. “Stage three:” Tia gasped at the new  version she didn't know about. “Shotgun.” Putting the weapons end to  end they started to glow a moment before reshaping into a new type of  gun. “Best for short-range combat. The farther away the enemy is, the  less damage it will do.” To prove the point she shot towards the tree  far off and blasted off several chunks of bark from it. Turning, she  aimed at a tree close to them and fired again, this time ripping it in  half and making it fall over.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wow!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stage four,” Nanoha  went on. “Sniper rifle.” The weapon once again shifted shape, forming a  long range gun with a scope. “Once you become skilled in this, you can  shoot anything from as far away as you need to be. The stronger your  magical power is, the farther away you can shoot. Stage five: power  shot.” Cross mirage turned back into it's normal pistol form, only this  time the colors were black and red. “Here, Tia. You need to fire this.”  She placed the gun into her student's hands. “Grip it with both hands,  hold it firm.” She stood behind her and put her hands on top of Tia's.  “This will kick you back hard, as if you just just got hit by Subaru's  Divine Buster, so brace for it.” She looked down and saw Tia's stance  shift. “Aim toward the sky. Good. Prepare and fire.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia  swallowed, double checking her footing, and pulled the trigger. The  immediate force was so overwhelming it would have forced her to her  knees if Nanoha hadn't been supporting her. Large amounts of energy  ripped from the barrel, spreading out into a large wide-range area.  Constantly magic poured into the device, flaring out smaller blast that  circled the main one. When the orange magical beam hit the top of the  barrier it only paused for a few seconds before ripping straight  through it and into the sky. Once done Tia fell to her knees and panted  out heavily, sweat covering her body. “I...” She panted, shocked.  “Wow...” Looking up, she gave Nanoha an amazed look. “So strong... I  feel as if everything in me was sucked out at once.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm sure  you understand that this mode isn't meant to be used and that's why it  was locked from you?” Nanoha sat down next to her student while she  recovered. “I will teach you how to become a multiple weapon user like  myself if you want. Before you answer I want to explain things to you.  It isn't easy, and if you are not proficient at a weapon it doesn't  matter how strong it is because you won't hit anything with it. I'm  sure you noticed this the first time you shot left-handed?” Tia moved  to sit properly and reflected back, nodding. “This is also not always a  good thing. A multi weapon isn't something that is ultra powerful, that  comes from your personal magic. This will make you adaptable and more  efficient, not stronger. A 'Jack of all trades, master of none' type of  deal. Weither or not you become a one hundred percent sharp shooter  with dual pistols or a seventy percent accuracy multi-user doesn't  matter. Cross Mirage will be used to it's full capacity either way,  adapting to your style. If you become a master of a certain style while  still using others depends on how much you will commit yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see... And you will teach me if I decide to do this?” Nanoha nodded at  her. “I need time to think about it...” She gazed at the new form of  her trusted partner. “Can I answer you later?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whenever you're  ready. Now come on,” Standing, she offered Tia a hand. “I'm going to be  late for my kick boxing lessons if I don't run off. You need to get  some food and rest up.” The gunslinger took the offered hand and smiled  when she was lifted up to her feet. “Think about it and answer me  whenever you want, don't rush it. Right now let's focus on the upcoming  mage test and go from there.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
A  woman with deep red hair pulled up into a sharp ponytail walked briskly  across the grounds of the military base. With two fingers she adjusted  her thin red lined glasses properly onto her nose and made her way into  the main office building of section six. With a quick look she spotted  the main desk on the bottom floor and moved toward it. Loud clicking  sounds echoed as she walked, getting several people's attention onto  her. Once at her destination she glared at the secretary there and  spoke to her in an official toned voice. “Hello, I need to speak with  Hayate Yagami or one of the two mages recently involved with the death  of Jail Scaglietti: Nanoha Takamachi or Fate Harlaown.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm sorry,  ma'am,” The secretary apologized with a light bow of her head.  “Hayate-sama is currently busy and Fate-sama is making her rounds right  now. If you would like to schedule an appointment I can-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don't have time for games,” The woman interrupted her coldly. “I have  urgent business to discuss with them and do not like to be kept  waiting. Where is Takamachi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma'am, she isn't under our department so-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  find one of them and get them here now.” She slapped her hand onto the  desk, making the secretary jump lightly in her chair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A new voice  came up, making both of them turn to see Yuuno approaching them. “Is  there a problem here?” He wondered, eying the woman. The secretary  started to give information about the situation but was once more cut  off by the red haired lady.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I need to see Yagami, Harlaown, or  Takamachi right away, could you be of any more assistance than this  woman here?” She jerked her thumb towards the secretary.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It is  rather rude to ask for favors when one has not first introduced  themselves, is it not?” Yuuno replied smoothly, leaning against the  counter and clasping his hands together casually.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The woman  seemed a little miffed at the casual appearance but introduced herself  anyway. “Tribeca. My last name isn't important; and you are?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno  Scrya. I see you've met Allison already.” He nodded towards the  secretary. “Unfortunately all three of them are busy at the current  moment, if I can assist you with anything I would be more than happy  too...” His voice trailed off when Tribeca reached into her hand bag  and pulled out a folder to start flipping through it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The woman  read a little bit on the page and snapped the folder shut. “You are  Yuuno Scrya of the Scrya clan, chief of infinite library, and civilian  collaborator of Mobile Division Section Six?” She eyed him harshly as  the man slowly nodded, confused. “Then this trip wasn't a total loss. I  was also asked to offer you a job for us regardless if the unison  request was accepted or not.” She offered her hand, suddenly showing  respect for the male. “My superior request that you come back with me  for full details on the matter. In short we are proposing you an  unlimited budget for research, access to all information including some  of which is not in the library, and a support team of one hundred of  our top scientist.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?” Yuuno shook her hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  exchange for you researching what we request and overseeing  construction of certain items.” Tribeca met his eyes. “Please consider  joining our organization.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is the name of this organization that you speak of?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Uniformity of the Four Quadrants, or U.F.C. For short.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno's  eyes widened a moment before narrowing. “I assume you would request me  to develop weaponry for you?” His voice lost it's casualness. “What do  you want with the people you named? What is this Unison request you  spoke of?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tribeca noted the change in tone. “Jail Scaglietti  worked for us and we would like enlist the aid of the people who  disposed of him for our army.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'll take the papers.” Yuuno held  out his hand. “Please leave the premises immediately. Admiral Chrono  will contact you in a few days to give you the news.” He was handed a  small disc shaped item and the red haired woman turned to leave.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please think about the offer, Yuuno-sensei.” With that, she left the build and teleported once outside.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is  Hayate in her office?” Yuuno asked immediately, getting a short nod.  Wasting no time he ran to the elevator and pushed the button, ignoring  his friend telling him that she didn't want to be disturbed right now.  The ride up did nothing to calm his nerves and by the time he reached  the hallway of the top floor his hands were already shaking. The man  stood in front of Hayate's door a few moments before knocking on it  briskly. A short reply told him to enter so he did, walking over to the  girl and sitting down in front of her. Hayate seemed shocked to see him  and quickly closed down all her monitors. The two sat in silence for  almost a minute before Yuuno spoke up, handing her the disc. “We're in  trouble. The U.F.C. took notice of us and wants section six to be part  of their army.” Hayate blinked, slowly taking the offered item. “Before  you load that lock everything and put it in a separate player that  isn't connected with anything. I don't want any chance of a virus being  on board.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The U.F.C...” Hayate seemed a little confused. “You  mean the people who are trying to get everyone in the four quadrants of  the universes to be under one rule?” Yuuno nodded at her. “The...same  ones that have declared war on several planets when they refused to  meet their 'terms' for the treaty?” Again another nod, making Hayate  swallow. “The ones... that have a record of being bitter enemies of the  T.S.A.B and have committed genocide of entire planets just because they  were allied with us?” Yuuno nodded a third time. “They... want us now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  that's not the worst part.” Yuuno looked into her eyes. “Apparently  Jail was just an expendable scientist to them. Us killing him attracted  their attention, and they already gave me a job offer. I'm sorry,  there's more,” He reached out and caught Hayate's hand when she went to  summon a monitor. “They know You, Fate, Nanoha, and myself by name.  We're specific targets.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...I think I'm going to throw up.” She  took a few deep breaths and found Yuuno beside her, rubbing her back  shortly after. “This stays between us, I will contact Chrono directly  about this... Carim of the Saint Church will probably need to know as  well. No one else, though. Don't mention this to Nanoha or Fate  especially all right?” She got an understanding nod so she took one  last steadying breath. “Let's see what's on this disc...”</span></p>

“Subaru,  I'm home.” Tia spoke softly as she entered the dark room. She heard a  small mummer from the direction of the beds and smiled to herself.  “Sorry to wake you.” The door closed softly and the orange haired girl  felt her way across the room to her dresser. The third drawer was  opened and a small light came on inside of it,casting a soft blueish  white haze over the contents. Picking up a long loose shirt, she closed  the drawer and started to strip. Her still damp hair fell out behind  her after a quick pull to get it out from under her sleep shirt. With a  small shake of her head she fluffed her hair out a little more and  peeled off her socks. Normally she wouldn't have bothered to put some  on after a shower but the cold weather had started getting worse the  past few days. Already she could see her breath during early morning  jogs and late night exercises. “Subaru, do you mind if I cut the heat  on a little more?” Another half hearted moan acknowledged her and she  took it as a 'go ahead', which she did. Almost at once a soft hum came  from the vents as the warm air flowed into the room. At times like this  she almost wished the top bunk was hers, as it was normally warm and  cozy instead of chilly like hers was. Disregarding that, she moved over  to her bed and pulled up the covers to slide in and almost yelped when  she felt someone in her bed as well. “Subaru! What are you doing in my  bed?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sleeping,” She replied absently, clearly not awake yet.  “You're letting in cold air, stop.” Lazily she reached up to pull the  covers back down. “Hurry and get in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But,” She blushed. “Subaru, it's embarrassing... get in your bed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  blue haired girl finally opened her eyes and looked up at the girl  sitting on the mattress. “I fell asleep waiting for you, don't make me  get in my cold bed?” Her sleepy request hit it's mark, making Tia sigh  and start to move. “I don't want you to leave either,” She added in  while gripping her nightshirt. “Sleep with me, Tia?” At first the girl  didn't do anything but stay still, slowly reaching a hand over to touch  Subaru's fingers clutching her shirt. “Come on,” Subaru whispered  again, giving a slight tug. “Please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Okay,” even though it  was only the two of them in the room she still spoke in a whisper, as  if she didn't want anyone else to overhear. Sinking down, she laid  herself under the covers and got comfortable, immediately feeling  Subaru press up against her front and lay an arm across her waist. Soon  after, a smooth leg ran up between hers, stopping at her shins.  Subaru's knee was brought up next, stopping at her inner thighs while  cuddling. “Subaru...” The name came out as a soft gasp, inhaling her  sleeping partner's breath. Their eyes were still open, looking at each  other from the scarce few inches between them. Tia licked her lips  without thinking about it. “You smell good,” She stated, getting a  goofy smile. The close contact was making her heart beat faster and the  rubbing on her side was doing nothing to calm her down. 'T<em>his is why I didn't want to sleep with her,</em>' She thought to herself, cheeks coloring at the innocent intended touching. 'T<em>here's no way I can sleep like this... my heart is beating too fast...</em>'  She looked down at her girlfriend's lips. '<em>How long has it been since we went open with our relationship?</em>' Her hand went up to touch Subaru's cheek and was rewarded with a happy smile from the sleepy girl. '<em>Just one kiss will be okay. We can sleep after a goodnight kiss...</em>'</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Leaning  forward, she slightly pressed their lips together softly. Tia heard a  soft content sound come from her partner and felt a little bit of pride  inside of herself for causing it. '<em>One more... one more and then we'll  sleep,</em>' She let the idea run though her mind as she took a small breath and kissed her again, being pulled closer. '<em> One more... Just one more...</em>'  The rubbing on her side had finally worked her shirt up enough to feel  Subaru's warm hand touch her skin, giving her a full body shiver.  Without realizing it she gave a slight rock of her body against her,  moving her hand down over Subaru's back and lifting her shirt enough to  rub her skin directly. A flurry of kisses followed, each one leaving  them slightly out of breath and more awake. The amount of time it took  was unknown to them but Tia soon found herself pressed hard against her  girlfriend, hands trailing each other's bodies freely without  restraint. Having had her fill of touching, the orange haired one  rolled over on top of her girlfriend. Panting, they looked into each  other's eyes with foreheads touching. “Subaru,” She began, smiling  fondly down at her and breathing harder than normal. “I love you,  Subaru.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia...” The feelings the single word had could not be  described. The smile on her face said it all, the sheer amount of joy  running though her heart. Hugging her tightly, Subaru nodded quickly.  “I love you too! Lots and lots!” They stayed together hugging for a  long moment, stopping only when Tia started kissing her neck. Taking  the hint, the blue haired girl began rubbing her skin. Moving back,  they looked at each other a moment more before kissing again,  whispering the same three words over and over again as their bodies  started rocking against each other.</span></p>

“Well,”  Chrono Harlaown leaned back in his chair and looked at the monitors in  front of him. Hayate was in the middle, paired with Yuuno in his own  screen to her left. Adding in on Hayate's right was a blond woman  dressed in something that resembled a religious gown. “The U.F.Q...  I've had some particularly bitter encounters with them as well but I  never would have thought that Jail Scaglietti would be working for  them. However, if they got interested in you because you killed him  then it means that he was highly looked upon, although they were  probably looking for a way to cut him off anyway...” He rubbed the  bridge of his nose. “The peace treaty they gave you is one I've seen  countless times before, it's nothing more than a formal 'join us or be  destroyed' letter.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This isn't the first time?” Carim asked softly,  looking over at him from her side of the screen. “They have contacted  you before about things like this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not me directly but people  under me. What they want is for the T.S.A.B, which looks over most of  the eastern quadrant, to give in to them and basically adhere to their  rules. In short, let them regulate trade, speak their common language,  use their money, and in all ways have a 'we will protect you until you  piss us off, then we'll kill you and use it as an example to others'  deal. They think that by using force they can make all of the universe  completely peaceful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno nodded. “I've read several things  about them. As an advanced dictatorship they leave a few highly trained  people on each planet and use their advanced weaponry to basically  enslave it until the person in charge figures out how the planet is  ran, then proceeds to do so. On a small scale they really do bring  peace and harmony to everyone under them. However they are too  severe... Zero tolerance. Instead of trying to control a planet that  uprises against them...” He nodded at their looks to confirm the worst.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are they dumb enough to challenge the entire T.S.A.B?” Hayate looked over at everyone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Negative,”  Chrono shook his head slowly. “They only want recruiting whenever they  mess with us. Declaring an all out war would destroy more than could  ever be recovered. Even they know that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So when we tell them  no, will they back off?” Carim pondered it. “I have a feeling that it  won't be that simple, given there history.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chrono closed his eyes. “No, they won't.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anyone  who turns them down dies.” Yuuno gave the news that Chrono obviously  didn't want to say. “They're going to try and assassinate Fate, Nanoha,  Hayate and myself. Make sure we can't be used against them if we won't <em>work for</em> them.<em>”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That's why we need your help, Carim.” Chrono looked towards the blond. “Will you lend us your aid?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Carim  tried her best to smile given the situation. “You have the full support  of the church. We will deploy a special team there for 'good relations'  on the outside view. Hayate, may we impose upon some rooms from you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have rooms and job placements for everyone who would like to take them, free of charge with full benefits of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blond did smile this time. “Don't worry, they will give up if they can't succeed right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“From  the past records, yes.” Yuuno nodded. “The forwards may be in trouble  as well so let's stay on the down low. Make sure none of them stand out  in any way. Chrono, will you give them our answer?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, I will  contact Tribeca as soon as our conference has ended. In the mean time,  stay low and on guard. Inform Nanoha and Fate to stay on alert but  don't tell them anything more than is necessary. They have been through  so much lately I don't think they can mentally handle something like  this out of the blue. I want to take no chances at all on Fate until  we're absolutely positive there's no chance of her forgetting anything  he recently remembered.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno looked at Chrono in shock. “You don't think we should tell them someone is trying to <em>kill</em> them!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno!” Chrono glared at him. “If you told Nanoha someone was trying to kill Fate, what would be the <em>first</em> thing she'd do?” The other male stayed silent, looking away. “Right. We  can't have them acting rashly like that. Ground them to the base, make  any excuse, send them to Earth for a while, I don't care. Just make  sure they are being observed every hour of the day. Same with you two,  just stay safe. I'm approving the limiter removal of all three aces.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  agree,” Carim added in to the mix. “Both of us together can make the  higher ups understand. As an assassination attempt it shouldn't be that  hard.” The room got silent for a few moments after Hayate thanked them.  “Well, we shouldn't waste time. I will get on everything right now.”  All four people looked at their screens a moment longer before nodding  at each other and cutting communications.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chrono took a deep  steading breath after seeing the monitors click off in front of him.  “Well then... I better get this over with.” Inserting the small disc he  was given into a separate drive, he brought up a contact monitor that  connected him to Tribeca. “Hello,” He greeted her civilly and instantly  got a frown. “I'm afraid I will have to turn down your offer for  section Six's Aces.” The monitor cut off on him, immediately sending  the separate player into a sparking fit, destroying it. “Well,” He  mused while looking at the smoking device. “Good thing Yuuno warned me  about that...”</span></p>

Elio awoke slowly, the dim light shining across his eyes thanks to the morning sun creeping through his blinds. '<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Already?'</span></em> He reached up and rubbed his eyes lightly. '<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Time for another day; better get ready.</span></em>'  He had never had trouble waking up before and today was no exception.  As soon as he sat up his eyes were sharp and the schedule was being  played out in his mind. Something gripped his shirt, making him turn  quickly to the side with a fast jerk. Caro laid next to him in her  pajamas, still sleeping despite his motions. '<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro, not again?</span></em>' With a sigh he gently moved her hand from his shirt and placed it on the bed to let her sleep while he prepared for the day. '<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It's been almost two months since I came back and you still sneak into my bed to make sure I don't go anywhere?</span></em>'  his mind pondered the situation while looking around his room for sweat  pants and shirt to jog in. After Lutecia had finally settled down in  Caro's room and made herself at home with her new bunk mate Caro had  been spending all her time with her. At first he felt a little odd  because he was used to her holding onto him everywhere he went but soon  found out that she was holding back because she wanted to get to know  the purple haired girl better. Because of this she became extra clingy  to him whenever they were alone, often sitting so close to him that he  put his arms around her shoulders to become more comfortable. When he  had disappeared all day one Firesday following to go work at Fuji's,  Caro had a fit wondering where he was or if he was abducted again.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  same night the dragon summoner had come into his room, asking if he  minded sleeping together. After the first turn down she brought up the  fact that Lutecia had slept with him one night and he quickly informed  her that it was a purely platonic thing. Once those words were said she  claimed that this was as well, and hopped under his covers. Thinking it  was a one night only deal he gave in and held her until morning. The  insect summoner threw a fit and claimed Caro was being 'unfair' at  something or another and stated that she would be spending the night in  his room. Weeks later and he found himself claimed as a human teddy  bear randomly, sometimes not realizing it until he woke up, such as  today. With a light shaking of his head, Elio pushed the thoughts from  his mind and slid on his socks. After lacing up his shoes he looked  over at the sleeping Caro and smiled to himself. Not thinking about it,  he brought up his fingers and formed a yellow screen between them to  frame her body and snapped a picture. “Store in album, please,” He  requested from Strada and got beep of acknowledgment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before  leaving his room he wrote a small note on his desk telling Caro good  morning and taped it to his door so she would see it. Now free of guilt  for leaving her asleep he walked out his door and made his way  downstairs. The freezing morning air greeted his lungs, leaving small  puffs of white fog from his lips when he exhaled. The boy stretched out  his muscles while walking to the track that circled the base. 'A<em>ll right,</em>' He looked at the lines and stretched out his legs as well. '<em>I  have a month before the mage test... Just long enough to make sure I'm  in top physical condition. I better make each day count.</em>' Narrowing his eyes, he started jogging down the track, breathing steadily. '<em>But for some reason, I have a feeling of dread in the back of my throat...</em>' The sky above him thundered loudly, making his eyes glance upward. '<em>No wonder the sunlight this morning was so weak... A storm is coming.</em>' The redhead's eyes went back down to look where he was running, catching a small glimpse of someone covered in a cloak. '<em>Eh? Someone else up at this early hour?</em>'  turning, he went to greet the person but found no one there. The boy's  eyes looked around himself, even turning in a circle to find him. 'T<em>hat's odd... Maybe I'm seeing things?</em>' Shrugging, he started jogging again. '<em>Oh well, nothing to do with me probably.</em>'</span></p>
