<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was odd.  Now matter how many I fought, none knew the name of the man I was  after. Time and time again I got the same answer: ‘who?’ It was  infuriating, making me want to scream. These people had Jewel Seeds,  why don’t they know my creator? Why does everything seem so confusing?  Why hasn’t anyone I know tried to contact me now that I was free again,  and for that matter where <em>is</em> everyone? Surely they would have  felt my presence by now… Despite all the setbacks I can’t give up yet,  there’s still so much I need to do. I have to find ‘him’. I have to get  my revenge for all the pain my friends and I have gone through…I can’t  afford to get caught now; too many people are counting on me!</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By: Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Skeith  landed with a loud clinking sound as her clawed armor touched the  concrete beneath her. The four people around her all immediately  stopped talking and turned to the new arrival, drawing their weapons.  “I want your item,” She told them steadily as she walked forward,  ignoring the humming sounds of charging weaponry. “Hand it over.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  her! The one that’s hunting Lost Logia traders!” One man charged  Skeith, drawing back his staff. “She has a bounty on her head, kill  her!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Skeith easily grabbed the man’s face with one hand,  gripping it tightly and dragging his struggling body as she kept  walking forward. “Hand it over. Now. I won’t ask again.” With a sharp  flick of her wrist she sent the man she held captive flying into one  that was jumping at her from the side. She extended her hand slowly,  forming a large yellow ball of energy in it before blasting the third  man back several yards.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Take it!” The final man threw the box at her and ran, leaping into the air.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  armor clad female grabbed the box and also took to the air, flying to a  nearby skyscraper and landing slowly. The box was pried open carefully,  reaching into it and pulling the blue Jewel Seed out of it. “Yes!”  Skeith dropped the box in her excitement. “Hanon! It’s you! Hanon, wake  up!” The seed remained calm. “Hanon! Come on!” Skeith’s excitement  faded when the seed didn’t respond to her. “No…Not you too…” Falling to  her knees, the girl caressed the seed in her hands sadly. “Hanon…You  were my best friend…” A small teardrop fell, dropping onto the lifeless  artifact. “Damn it… How many more will I find dead!?” Her hand reared  back and punched the top of the roof, shattering the flooring. “You  will pay for toying with our lives…Wily Scaglietti!!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wily…Scaglietti?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Skeith  gripped the seed and slid it in a side pouch on her armor as she stood  up. Across the roof and to her side was Caro riding on top of her  dragon in full size mode. “It’s the little brat today,” Skeith mused as  she walked across the roof towards her. “I’m not in a good mood, leave  me before I hurt you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please! Let Nanoha-san go!” Caro swallowed thickly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  been a month now; can you people only say the same thing over and over  again?” The woman stopped at the edge, flaring her leather wings out  behind her. “I told you, there is something I need to do, and I won’t  give up this chance to do it!” She threw out her arm in annoyance.  “Leave me alone! Stop stalking me!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The pink haired girl stayed  silent a moment before nodding to herself. “I’m sorry, I have been  ordered to bring you into custody. Please come with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Heh.”  Skeith flexed her fingers a moment before lunging at the girl with  claws outstretched. The auto barrier was destroyed instantly and she  landed on top of the dragon right in front of Caro’s shocked face.  “Your dragon would cause even me a problem,” She told her softly. “So I  will make it go away!” Clapping her hands together, Skeith yelled out  as a yellow magical circle flared around her hands before being thrust  down onto the dragon’s back. “Disspell!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro felt a part of  herself being ripped away as white smoke floated up around her.  “No…Freidliche!” All at once the dragon vanished, leaving her to hover  in the air a moment before sinking through the smoke and falling. The  girl tumbled around helplessly, screaming out in terror as the many  floors sailed past her. She could feel her eyes water from the force of  the wind as she free fell, mind quickly trying to come up with a plan  to stop herself. ‘<em>I’m going to die</em>…’ She thought in a sudden  realization when the ground started to noticeably get closer to her.  The girl closed her eyes and held her breath tightly, too afraid to  look. “Mother!!!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Arms wrapped around the falling girl, quickly  changing her course of direction. Caro instantly clung to whoever had  saved her and sobbed into their chest as they landed lightly several  paces away from the area they had been. A small silence passed before  she was rudely dropped to the ground, landing hard and hitting her head  on the dirt. Slowly she opened her eyes and stared up in disbelief at  Skeith, who was glaring down at her. Without saying anything the woman  turned and took back off into the air, leaving the scared and confused  girl to lie on the grass. In the sky Skeith flew silently, eyes  clouding lightly as her hands gripped the jewel seed she just gained. ‘<em>Hanon…Even  though we went through everything together you kept saying that murder  wasn’t right…Why? Why didn’t you want to kill him for doing that to us?  Why did you keep trying to save people you didn’t even know…? Consider  this a token to my friend, child.’</em> Her eyes glanced behind herself to make sure Caro didn’t have some way of following her. ‘<em>Next time, I won’t hesitate to let you die…</em>’</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“You  fought Skeith!?” Hayate almost screamed out when Caro reported to her.  Fate and Yuuno were also staring at the girl in shock, the former  running over to her and making sure she was okay. “Caro, you were  supposed to contact us the moment you found her!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was, but she  spotted me,” Caro replied, allowing Fate to obsess over her. “Fate-san,  she didn’t hurt me, she actually saved me from falling off a building.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?” Fate licked her lips in thought. “Nanoha must still be able to influence Skeith just a little bit…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She also said something,” Caro recalled, looking up at Fate again. “Wily Scaglietti. I think it’s a name?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno  froze, body posed as if he was about to say something but suddenly  decided not to. Fate noticed and looked over at him inquisitively.  “Nothing…” He told her, looking away and swallowing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know something?” Fate asked, walking over to him. “That name is too close to that bastard’s to let slide!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No…” He looked over at Caro.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro, please leave.” Fate told her sternly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes ma’am!” She saluted before quickly running out of the room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now  spill it!” Fate got up into Yuuno’s face, glaring at him. The male  looked down at her softly for a few seconds to allow Fate a moment to  calm down. Once she realized her outbreak Fate sighed and closed her  eyes, allowing her forehead to rest against his chest. “I’m sorry  Yuuno.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Its okay,” His hands went around her in an encouraging  hug. “Fate… Wily Scaglietti… is the one who started Project F.” He felt  Fate instantly go stiff in his arms. “His research was continued by  Precia…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The way I was created…” She whispered softly, eyes now  wide. Although the arms around her tightened, she could find no comfort  after the news. “So Skeith…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Is probably related to your birth  in some way.” He finished for her sadly. “I’ll bring up the files I  have on my computer back home. I’ll be back in a week tops.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay…Thank you.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Doctor  Wily,” A middle aged man walked across the laboratory with a clipboard  in his hands. “Here are the results from the last testing; it seems  that the child we used made it a lot farther than the rest. We believe  it’s because he had lost his will to live and didn’t have conflicting  emotions.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see…” The man turned to accept the clipboard of papers.  Dark gray hair hung around his head around a bald spot on top, paired  with a mustache that was equally gray with wisp of white flecking it.  “Then I believe we should neutralize any un-needed emotions before the  conversion process.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Suggestions?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Take out everything  but fear, hate, jealousy, envy, pride, sadness and anger. This is a  minor set back, but it will ultimately lead to the creation of the  perfect A.I!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sir,” The man nodded and walked over to the large computer, typing out commands. “Which test subject will undergo this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about the one with the yellow hair? She seems to be the most influenced by emotions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  do you allow Hanon to stay out of the experiments?” The assistant  asked, looking over at him. “She constantly defiles us. She’s a test  subject, we should use her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She keeps them from dieing,” Wily  replied casually. “Just one more thing we don’t have to worry about.  Now, bring the girl. Purge her emotions and place her under  observation. Also make sure Hanon and her are together. I wish to use  it to farther push the lass over the edge when I convert her into a  jewel seed. She will be the ultimate weapon of destruction…not even the  book of darkness will match her!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes sir!” The man walked over  to a large cage in the room, unlocking it and walking over to a teenage  girl and grabbing her arm. “You’re up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, no!” The girl fought  back weakly, trying to free herself. “Don’t kill me! Hanon! Hanon help  me!” She reached out towards the blue haired girl, who instantly tried  to pull her back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stay!” The assistant kicked the other girl, knocking her to the side and dragging out the still screaming prisoner.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t….don’t…” The girl cried softly, too tired to protest physically anymore. “I don’t’ want to die… don’t kill me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  won’t die,” Wily informed her, locking her into a chair and placing a  type of helmet onto her head. “After this, you will feel better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ready to purge, doctor.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Begin  process.” He passively watched as the girl began to spasm and cry in  pain. “Let’s code name this one… I have high expectations…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Name, sir?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Call her…. Skeith.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
A  flash of lightning and roar of thunder awoke Skeith from her nightmare  slowly. Her eyes opened and stared out from under the bridge where she  was currently hiding. The girl wiped sweat from her face and leaned  over to get comfortable, ignoring the trail of tears rolling down her  cheeks.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>That must have been painful,</em>” a voice from inside told her, making Skeith gasp and look around. “<em>I had no idea…</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Oh…it’s you.</em>” Skeith settled down and glared at nothing in particular as she talked to Nanoha. “<em>You just won’t shut up will you?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I’m bored,</em>” She replied a little snippy before calming back down again. “<em>So that is why you are after the doctor?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Shut up, I don’t need to answer any of your questions. Go back to sleep.</em>”  She gripped her fist hard as she concentrated, forcing the voice back  down into the recesses of her mind. Once silenced, Skeith stood and  stretched before flying out from the bridge and looking around. ‘<em>The people have increased their efforts to bring me down,</em>’ she thought bitterly as the rain and wind lashed around her body. ‘<em>I  can’t find him anywhere, but I know he worked in this city…He stopped  his aging process so he couldn’t have died… What if someone else killed  him? No!</em>’ Skeith snarled angrily. ‘<em>I have to be the one to…</em>’  She came to a stop, eyes meeting the woman’s in front of her. “Signum,”  she stated as she flexed her fingers to prepare for battle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Skeith,”  She replied in kind, drawing her sword. “I won’t waste time with words.  My unit was ordered to bring you in, and I will.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl glared  at Signum a moment before screaming and flying forward. The sword was  grabbed with one hand when she was close, but felt it be pulled out of  her grasp and slung again. Skeith brought her arm up and caught it on  the spikes covering her armor, twisting her body as she allowed the  blade to slip past her without a cut. Attacking again, she punched  Signum’s blade back and followed up with a roundhouse, knocking the  woman away. ‘<em>I can’t win without a weapon,</em>’ She thought bitterly as her opponent’s blade shattered into something she called ‘snake form.’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Signum  lashed her sword chain whip quickly, making it loop around her enemy  and tie the arms to her sides. “Yield.” She tugged on her handle,  biting the blades into the armor and scratching it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not until I finish what I need to do,” Skeith spat at her as she wiggled to try to free herself, ignoring the wounds it caused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  do you need to do?” Signum flew forwards and looked into her eyes.  “Maybe we can work out a deal. We will help you if you give us Nanoha  back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like I would fall for something like that?” Skeith  grinned darkly, making Signum look down in shock at the bloody arm  pressing against her stomach. “Data Drain!” Several orange beams shot  out from Skeith’s wrist, twirling slowly as red and green hexagons  filled the spaces between them, leaving several places open. “Raising  Heart may refuse me as its master,” She told Signum as a black ball of  energy shot into her stomach. “But that won’t keep me from copying  yours!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Signum felt her body go numb, the rain steadily weighing  her down to the point where she just wanted to collapse. All of her  energy left, being sucked away into the red and black stream leading to  Skeith’s hand. Finally after what seemed like countless seconds Signum  passed out, falling through the air and landing harshly in the river  below.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Skeith gasped out, eyes going wide as the magic poured  through her. “Phase Shift!” She cried out, reaching behind her back and  gripping her hand. Yellow energy flared around her as she pulled  upwards, as if unsheathing the sword that was being created. “Signum!”  Once the weapon was free, the woman swung the sword around a few times  to get the feel of it. It was almost a perfect copy of the knight’s  weapon, only tinted with a yellow that matched her eyes. “Now, I can  properly defend myself against them.” Looking to the side, she narrowed  her eyes as the rain stung the skin of her wounded arm. “But first, I  need to heal…” Her eyes looked downwards as the blood oozed out from  the multiple cuts she received while wiggling her arm out of the snake  bind.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“They found  Signum,” Rein told Hayate after closing a monitor display. “She’s in  the hospital wing right now; Shamal says she will be fine. She took  serious damage to her linker core.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Signum…” Hayate waved off the  monitors around herself and scooted her chair back. “I’m going to check  on her.” Quickly she grabbed her coat and briskly walked to the door.  As soon as she opened it she ran into someone’s chest, making her fall  backwards. A strong hand reached out and caught her, preventing the  woman from hitting the floor. “Sorry,” She apologized quickly before  looking up to see who it was. “…Admiral Chrono!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,” He  grinned, winking. “You sure looked stressed, glad I came.” Chrono  helped her to stand up properly and chuckled to himself. “I heard you  were assigned to take down some SS-ranked mage and were having troubles  so I came to visit everyone on my leave and see if I could help!” He  brought up an arm and flexed his muscle playfully. “I’ll knock’em out  before they know what happened!” Chrono waited a moment for a laugh but  when he didn’t receive one he looked down again. “Hey… What’s wrong,  you’re so serious looking all of a sudden?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Chrono,” She spoke softly, looking down. “I’m sorry I hid this from you in the reports but…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…What is it?” A flash of lightning made the lights flicker in the office. “Did something bad happen?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She sighed. “Walk with me.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate  woke up slowly, eyes not wanting to open even though they were being  commanded to. Words spun around her as people talked but she couldn’t  seem to make sense of any of it. Finally after a few moments she  managed to make out her name and a face came close to hers. Chrono gave  her a sad look, making her realize that she must have fallen asleep  while leaning against him. Although she hadn’t seen him in a little  over two months their reunion wasn’t fun at all, being mostly nothing  but her crying and him being briefed on the situation. The world  shifted as she was picked up and carried off, hearing something about a  proper night’s rest. “No,” She whispered, trying to move enough so she  would be placed on her feet. “I have to search… I have to…”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  been like this since Yuuno-kun left,” Hayate told Chrono as they went  from the office building to the residential area. “I think her nap just  now was the first time she’s slept in over forty-eight hours.” Her gaze  went to the girl who was giving up her struggle simply because her body  wouldn’t allow her to move anymore. “When she does sleep…she screams  and cries.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She stays with you?” Chrono tried to make his little sister more comfortable as he carried her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whenever I can convince her of it. She sleeps on her couch, I don’t think she’s gotten in her bed since Nanoha was taken over.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see…Yuuno’s been taking care of her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, he’s pretty bad off too, but he’s hiding it well for her sake.” She nodded at Fate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She sleeps roughly five hours a day,” Rein informed him when they met up on the elevator.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rein!” Hayate scolded her. “Don’t tell him that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Get  some rest tonight, as your superior I command you.” He walked out of  the elevator when they reached the sixth floor. “You are forbidden to  leave your quarters from now until lunch tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes sir,” She saluted him as the doors closed. “…Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chrono  opened the door to his sister’s loft and walked into it, frowning at  the sight. Everything was clean and in place and it was slightly warm  in the room. “Been cleaning?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can’t sleep, so I clean.” She whispered, voice tired. “Don’t change the temperature… Nanoha likes it a little warm.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  you like it more than just a little cold,” He told her, sitting the  girl on the couch and knocking the temperature down several degrees.  “You will sleep better if you’re comfortable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I need to-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We will. Tomorrow. Sleep.” He pushed her back down onto the couch. “I’m going to stay the night okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,”  Fate gave up and allowed herself to close her eyes, pressing her back  far into the couch. “Yuuno sleeps on my bed, help yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you,” Chrono stayed downstairs until he heard soft snores coming from  his little sister then headed up the stairs and looking around. The bed  was neat as well, probably Yuuno’s doing. Several of the man’s clothes  were laid out and two suitcases were at the foot of the bed. ‘<em>I guess she can’t sleep in such a big bed by herself…</em>’</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Hanon! Don’t let them take you! I need you!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shhh,  I knew this time would come eventually,” The blue haired girl whispered  softly to the teenager in her arms. “If they succeed on me, you won’t  have to go through it,” She added in, gently hugging her. “So I need to  do this. If it will spare you, I will do anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hanon…why? Why are you always protecting me… I don’t understand…?” Tears fell down the girl’s cheeks freely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Gently  Hanon moved her chin up so they could look into each other’s eyes. “One  day…” The girl kissed her softly. “You will understand. Don’t let them  win, Aura. Don’t let go of what remains of what they took away. Embrace  them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t understand…” Skeith sobbed out again as the lab  assistant took Hanon’s shoulder and puller her away. “Hanon! Don’t take  Hanon!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Quiet, Skeith.” The assistant yelled at her. “You are coming to watch!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t let her see!” Hanon shouted at him. “I’ll come peacefully, she doesn’t need to witness it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On the contrary,” He grinned at her. “This is what we’re going for.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No… NO!” Hanon tried to force herself free of his grasp. “You said she would be let go! You promised!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  quick injection on her neck made Hanon fall limp, allowing the man to  heft her over his shoulder and drag Skeith along. The blue haired girl  was placed in a type of vertical glass tube before it was filled with a  strange liquid. “Hanon is ready, doctor.” He spoke, forcing Skeith in a  chair to watch. “You may begin conversion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t hurt her!”  Skeith screamed, struggling as hard as she could. Her eyes frantically  looked around for some way of getting loose and helping her. Scared and  confused, she struggled harder, crying in pain as the binds started to  cut into her skin. Lights flared all at once, drawing her attention to  the girl floating in the liquid as what she could only describe as  lightning flared out around it. “Hanon…” Her eyes widened in terror as  smoke cleared, now showing only a pulsating blue crystal where the girl  had once been.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Transformation complete!” The assistant cried out in joy. “Consciousness level…..seventy percent!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Our  best yet,” Wily mused as he walked over to grab the jewel seed. “Soon…  Soon we will be able to make the perfect A.I…. the most powerful weapon  that can truly think for itself and not be bound by a program!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hanon…”  Skeith gripped her fist, slowly raising her head to glare at the  doctor. “I’m going to kill you… with my own hands, I swear it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  yes, goooood.” Wily smirked down at her. “Hate me! Despise me! I will  use those to make you our first true success!” His sick smile only got  bigger when Skeith spat on him. “Soon, yes, soon… You will become my  greatest achievement!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Skeith  gasped out, sitting up from the mud and holding a hand to her mouth to  try and keep herself from getting sick. Looking around, she realized  that the rain from the past few days had let up and the sun was once  again shining. She didn’t feel any better from the change, though, and  bent over, one arm across her stomach and the other still covering her  mouth as she cried softly. “Hanon…”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Skeith…</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Go away… Go away, I can’t deal with you right now…</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You didn’t chose to be this way, Skeith… It’s not too late to turn back!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Shut up!</em>” She tried to collect herself. “<em>You  just want your body back! You don’t care about me, you never have and  you never will! No one does! I’m alone… I’m always be alone…</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Skeith…</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Stop looking into my dreams! Stop digging up my past!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You’re  not a bad person, I can tell! Skeith, stop what you’re doing! Stop  hurting people! Can’t you see this is exactly what they wanted!?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Shut up! Shut up! Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!” </em>Skeith gripped her head and sobbed out. “<em>I don’t want to remember this! I just want my revenge! You can have your body back after that, just leave me alone, Nanoha!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…<em>That’s the first time you’ve said my name.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Skeith shook her head roughly. “<em>Go away… Please… You don’t know what it’s like…</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I do. When we met, I”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I  don’t care about that! I don’t understand! I don’t understand anything!  Why are those people still trying to rescue you!? Why haven’t they  given up!? Why do they cry when they see me!? Why?! WHY!?</em>” She didn’t wait for and answer, instead pushing Nanoha back down into her mind, once again given blessed silence. ‘<em>When I first woke up it was so easy…</em>’ She thought to herself as she stood. ‘<em>I  only had to think about killing…But now… What are these feelings…Why am  I hesitating!? Murder is common isn’t it? That’s all I’ve seen, why do  I not kill people now? Hanon… What were you trying to teach me… What  are the emotions I lost? It hurts, Hanon… It hurts so bad…</em>’ Slowly  she walked down the slope under the bridge and into the water below to  try and remove the dirt and mud that was on her after sleeping.</span></p>

“I’m  back,” Yuuno called out as he stepped inside of the loft apartment.  Cool air greeted him instantly, making him blink. “Fate, you here?”  Looking around, he noticed that someone had slept on the couch last  night but when he put his hand on it, realized that Fate probably had  been up and out for a while now. A sound from the upstairs made him  quickly leap to the air and fly over to it, seeing Chrono sit up lazily  and yawn. “Chrono-kun!?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno?” He couldn’t help but grin at the man. “How long has it been since we’ve seen each other in person?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A long time.” The two friends smiled at each other before Yuuno suddenly got serious. “You know then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…I know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  have my research,” Yuuno held up something that looked like a book. “I  went through everything I found and put it all in a report. Where is  Fate, she needs to hear this too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s not downstairs?” He got a shaking of the head. “Dammit… Can’t she wait for anything…?”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Nicely  done,” Vita congratulated the forwards. “Caro, good work with your  dragon. I’m pleasantly surprised to see you recover so fast after  summoning him again.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” She panted, reaching out to rub her Dragon’s back to compliment it as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru,  Tia, nice combination today.” She gave them a rare praise and  immediately turned to Elio. “Can you still not call that armor you told  us about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No ma’am,” He looked down. “I don’t have any idea how  it works.” His face picked up a little when he felt Caro’s hand reach  up and take his to give an encouraging squeeze.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Vita!” Yuuno called out, landing next to her from the air. “Training over?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For now, when did you get back?” She looked up at the boy. “Did you get the information?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, help me gather everyone.” He nodded to the girls. “Take the rest of the day off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But, don’t we get to know too!?” Tia asked, shocked. “She’s our friend also!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry, this has information you don’t need to hear.” Yuuno gave them a sad look before leaping into the air, followed by Vita.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We don’t need to hear…?” Subaru asked softly, looking at the people fly away.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“That’s  all of us,” Hayate confirmed as Shamal walked into the office. “Rein,  lights please.” The smaller part of herself nodded and typed on a  keyboard display, making the curtains close and the lights dim. “Yuuno,  what do you have for us?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,” He started, standing up and walking  to the middle of the dark room. Hayate and her knights, as well as  Chrono and his sister were all present for this. He seemed to have  trouble beginning so he turned to look over at Fate. “ Um…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Be blunt, it’s okay.” Fate nodded at him. “I’m a big girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right,”  He pushed his glasses up and waved his hand, making several displays  appear around him so everyone could see. “We all know Jail Scaglietti,  illegal logia collector, mastermind behind several relic  disappearances, and also head of illegal projects… Such as Project F.”  Several images came up of females in large tubes, suspended in liquid.  “Project F is the code name he uses to refer to his creation of  artificial beings. However, he is not the first person to attempt to do  so, as we all know.” He ignored the several worried glances being cast  at Fate. “I’ll get to the point. Caro has given us a name spoken by  Skeith: Wily Scaglietti.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Several images of an old scientist  appeared in the air. “He is the great grandfather of Jail whose main  purpose was to create the perfect artificial intelligence. His methods  were cruel and when the TSAB found out about it, he was brought down  immediately. He tried to escape with his project: the Jewel Seeds. He  stashed them on a deserted planet before being captured, later to be  found by none other than myself. Several of them went to non  administrated planet number ninety-seven. Precia Testarossa recovered  Wily’s research and improved upon it, ultimately creating Project F  based on those notes. Instead of trying to create AI by using real  humans as the base, she implanted AI into a human.” Yuuno glanced at  Fate, who was still watching. “We all know the rest so I’ll skip ahead  a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I scattered the seeds before Precia could get them,  and we ended up bringing her to justice. We thought that was the end of  the jewel seeds but as time passed we realized that there were more  that weren’t accounted for. As of now, Jail is creating his own by  whatever means, we don’t know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What does this have to do with Skeith?” Fate finally asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  was getting there,” He told her gently. Several more images appeared on  the screen. “Skeith is…The first success of complete artificial  intelligence. She was once a Mid-childra born child but she was turned  into Jewel Seed Zero. With the process being completed once already,  Precia easily altered it to make her own…. Fate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate leaned forward, rubbing her eyes. “Skeith is my proto type.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl felt Chrono rub her back soothingly as she absorbed the information. “Continue.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry,” Yuuno gave her one more glance before speaking again. “Fate, as  we know, has every resemblance to a real human being, down to her very  DNA since she was in all ways, replicated from her sister. She is a  real girl… Skeith is, how should I say, no more than a program with a  human heart, surpassing everything we know today.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even me?” Rein asked softly, getting eyes on her. “I’m a program, but I still…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rein-chan  is indeed very advanced,” Yuuno smiled at her. “But you are still  limited to your master, as are the knights. For example, none of you  could harm Hayate. Even if you wanted to, you are her protectors, it’s  in your code. You are all individuals with personalities and souls, but  still limited. Skeith is a free will, able to do anything, any time,  anywhere. She chose to save Nanoha, and chose to bind herself in the  process.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So if she is her own will, how can we save Nanoha?” Vita asked, annoyed. “You’re giving us information, I want a strategy!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Calm  down, Vita-chan.” Hayate spoke to her softly, putting an arm around the  girl. The room was dark but she was close enough to tell that the  smaller girl was trying to blink back tears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If Nanoha can  suppress Skeith for a while, we could make a unison device and put  Skeith’s program in it. The AI would be gone but the jewel seed will  still be on her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If we only knew Skeith was a program from the start…” Shamal whispered, closing her eyes. “I could have made something better…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Its my fault for not getting the information,” Yuuno countered, voice obviously in pain. “If only I had…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno,  that information took you over six years to find,” Signum told him  sternly. “There is no blame to be passed around. We need to solve this  problem instead of pointing fingers at ourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” Yuuno brought up more images. “I have a plan.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Skeith  grit her teeth, angrily lashing out at the people around her. Her sword  cut the very air as she swung, forcing several TSAB members flying back  and rolling on the ground. The ambush on her didn’t work the way they  had planned, and several double A ranked mages were injured, pushing  themselves up slowly. The girl walked over to one of them and kicked  him over, raising her sword up to impale him. Refusing to scream, the  male glared up at her, awaiting his death. Seconds ticked past before  Skeith made a scoffing sound and sheathed her weapon, angrily flying  away. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I hate this! I’m so confused I can’t think straight!</span></em>’ She  flew quickly, childishly destroying random items in her path before  jetting into a forest and cutting down trees in frustration. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’m supposed to kill! I’m supposed to get revenge! I have to avenge them! All of them!</span></em>’ Several more trees fell over as she punched and clawed through the bark. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Why!? Why am I letting myself be held back!? What am I feeling!?</span></em>’ The back of her neck itched slightly at the same time as a sharp pain rang through her heart. “Fate.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  can feel the synergy Nanoha and I share,” The blond spoke, drawing  Bardiche in his scythe form. “Its proof Nanoha is still alive inside  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Skeith flexed her fingers, growling deep in her throat. “I  see… It’s her that’s holding me back. It’s her that’s keeping me scared  and confused. It’s… its HER!” Skeith’s eyes glared at Fate darkly,  tears leaking from them. “If I kill you I’ll be able to seal her  completely, and then I can finish my mission!” Reaching behind herself,  she gripped air. Her hand pulled up quickly as she formed a sword.  “Phase shift: Signum!” Screaming out, she launched herself forward to  engage in battle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate parried the attack gracefully, twirling  her scythe around and attempting to hit her stomach with the staff part  but missing. “How did you get that sword?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My secret!” Skeith  slashed again, this time putting more effort into it and sending Fate  reeling back. Instead of chasing, she was forced to jump into the air  to avoid several balls of energy crashing where she just stood. Her  eyes turned to see Vita, gripping her hammer tightly in her hands.  Instinct made her dodge the next attack, narrowly avoiding Signum’s  sword as she flashed beside her. Skeith twisted in the air to avoid two  crystals attached to strings leading over to Shamal’s fingers. Beside  her Zafira stood as well, already trapping them within a barrier. “Che…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno  made his appearance next, forcing the girl to speed up her evasive  movements to avoid being caught in a bind spell. Her escape was cut off  roughly as she found her right leg suddenly being frozen. Looking  around, she spotted Chrono not too far away, eyes cold as ice. ‘<em>Too many,</em>’ She realized in fear. ‘<em>I can’t take them all!</em>’ Despite it, she found herself gripping her fist in annoyance. ‘<em>Why? WHY!?</em>’  She flew to the side of the barrier, only to be shot back by an outside  blast that was allowed entry. Subaru hovered outside the dome on top of  her wing road. The blue magic looped around the dome several times and  the Stars and Lightning Members were all placed around it, re-enforcing  the barrier and making sure Skeith couldn’t get out. ‘<em>Why do they go to such lengths for her!?</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Skeith looked around herself as the people surrounded her from all angles. ‘<em>It can’t end here…I have to avenge them!’</em> With a scream Skeith flared out her energy, shoving everyone back away  from her. Several magic bullets shot out, each homing in on a different  person. Combined with the attack, Skeith darted forward towards Fate.  Her sword clashed furiously against her scythe and after a few swings,  broke the girl down to her knees. A quick sidekick knocked Fate over  and allowed Skeith to take to the air, spinning her sword around  Shamal. The green clad woman expertly dodge the attack, flying  backwards so Signum could take over the encounter. She came paired with  Vita, who both double teamed her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Pulling away, she felt a chill  run down her spine as Chrono once again had a clear shot. Her armor  caught a light lair of frost on it before she flew away, flapping her  wings once. Tia was ready for her and emptied both of her gun barrels  in a successful attempt to keep Skeith from trying to leave the  barrier. The girl reloaded quickly, running along the wing road to keep  a steady eye on her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate attacked next, silver hair flowing  around her as her staff flashed a rain of fire upon her. A section of  the forest below caught flames, giving Skeith enough time with the  distraction to fly down into them, only to be greeted by Fate once  more. “Just <em>die</em>!” She screamed out, once again clashing blades  with her. Several cuts flecked her body from the pulsating plasma blade  making her run to the side to get some distance and fire several  bullets. “I won’t lose here, I won’t!” Yellow energy ripped around her,  slinging everyone into the barrier and bouncing them off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Increasing  her speed, Skeith darted around the dome, using her fist and feet to  beat up everyone she could before the short spell was over. Yuuno and  Shamal fell to the ground, wincing in pain since their shields weren’t  up at the moment of attack. “Die! All of you!” Skeith pulled her sword  again, slashing hectically at Vita and finally managing to get in a  solid slice on her side. Zafira came to her rescue by biting the  woman’s thigh and making her dart away. “Stop getting in my WAY!” a  large ball of energy formed, which she threw at the wolf, knocking  through his shield and sending him to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate once again  got in close, slashing and parrying with a speed that matched her  opponents. “We will not give up!” Fate told her sternly. “Nanoha!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t say that name!” Skeith screamed, pupils dilating. “Stop pretending to care! No one cares for anyone!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is  that what your twisted mind thinks!?” Fate called back, grabbing the  blade with her hand and ignoring the roaring pain it caused. Her scythe  slashed out, cleaving clean through Skeith’s armor on her chest. “We  love her! All of us!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s no such thing!” Skeith pulled her  sword back, slicing Fate’s hand. Continuing, she stabbed her sword  forward, narrowly missing her. “There’s only pain and sadness!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Listen  to yourself!” Fate flipped up her scythe, catching the end under  Skeith’s chin. With a twirl she launched her opponent against a burning  tree and flew after her when she went straight through it. “You’re  nothing but a demon!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They are the demons!” Skeith countered,  throwing burning ashes into Fate’s eyes. “I’ll kill them all! I have  to! They won’t rest peacefully until I do!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who!?” Fate leapt backwards, allowing Chrono to freeze the area along with Hayate while she tried to clear her vision.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Skeith  jumped through the sudden frozen ground and slid on the ice. The  temperature change was so drastic she could even see her breath now as  she panted. “All of them! Everyone who died in the process!” She  slashed her sword, sending arched energy blades to the woman. “And  everyone who died while sealed after it!” She slid along the ice as  Yuuno once again tried to bind her unsuccessfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wily is dead!” Fate screamed, suddenly appearing in front of Skeith and sending magic bullets into her stomach. “He’s <em>been</em> dead!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t believe you!” Skeith lost her sword in the barrage so launched  into attacking with her fist again. “What would you know!? You have no  idea what it’s like! Knowing you’re not real!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha!” Fate bent  backwards and flip kicked her followed by a sweep kick that made Skeith  jump to avoid it. “You idiot!” The blond grabbed Skeith’s ankle and  jerked, slamming her into the ground. “I was created by the same  process!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What!?” Skeith pushed up and pounced her, fist blazing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  dodged the attacks and grabbed the hands, feeling her own being cut by  the sharp curved armor blades. “You heard me!” The two rolled around on  the ground, trying to gain superiority. “The research that made you  also created me!” Fate managed to push Skeith down and punched her,  having lost Bardiche.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re lying! You’re <em>lying</em>!” Skeith kneed Fate and shoved her off. “You can’t be! If you were, you would be helping me! Helping me avenge them!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I <em>am</em>!”  Fate threw several small magical daggers at Skeith before dodging her  own version being tossed right back at her. “I’ve been chasing his  great grandson to bring him down!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t care about that! No  one cares!” Skeith felt her eyes water as the battle continued, each  sliding on the slick frozen ground. “We’re all alone in the end!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  die before I allow Nanoha to be alone!” Fate screamed mere inches in  front of Skeith’s face when she got close enough. “I love you, Nanoha!  Fight her down!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Fate…</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!” Skeith pulled one  hand back and punched Fate in the stomach, doubling her over. “I’ll  take you down so you will be too weak to fight anymore!” She pushed her  hand out, forming three orange strips around her wrist. The energy  grew, starting to rotate around her arm while forming red and greed  hexagons between them. “Data Drain!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate ignored the sudden pain from the attack, grabbing Skeith by the shoulders. “Nanoha! Come back! Fight this!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Skeith’s mask crept downwards slowly revealing her nose and mouth. “Fate…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!” The blonde’s eyes began to droop as her magic was siphoned away. “Nanoha…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate! Fate!” tears spilled from her eyes all at once.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  let her… control you…Nanoha…” Fate leaned forward, using the last of  her energy to grip her neck and pull her into a kiss.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Skeith  gasped, turning around quickly in the pitch black area she was in.  “What… No!” She turned around, seeing Nanoha’s body in front of her.  “No…No, no, no!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Skeith…” Nanoha took a few steps forward,  placing both her hands on the girl’s shoulders. Her enemy brought both  hands up to her face and sobbed out. “Why are you crying, Skeith?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  scared, I’m angry, I’m confused!” She looked at her counterpart with  terrified eyes. “Why? Why are they doing this!? Why are they getting  hurt just to help you!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because we’re friends.” Nanoha closed her eyes calmly. “I would do the same for them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But…I don’t understand…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Skeith…Don’t  be afraid of these feelings… They are what was robbed from you, I saw  it in your dreams. These are what makes you human, not a program.  Skeith… Can’t you see? You’ve become just what they wanted you to be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No…I… I’m different… I’m not their toy, I-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Skeith!”  The harsh word made the girl stop her ramblings. “Look at yourself… you  don’t have to be this way. I know, we’ve been together too long for me  not to have noticed it. You’re not evil deep inside. You’re just afraid  to accept the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is the truth?” Skeith looked at her pleadingly, her rage gone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  can’t seek revenge for your lost friends. Skeith, they don’t want you  to become what Wily wanted just to avenge their death. They would want  you, the survivor, to live. To not be held back, to hold your head up.  You don’t bear the burden of their death, Skeith… you are your own  being. You are alive, you have a heart, and you have a soul. There is  more than pain, there is more than fear… there is love Skeith.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Skeith’s eyes went wide as Fate kissed her. “This… this is the same feeling as Hanon… Before she…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She  loved you,” Nanoha told her softly. “This is that feeling. Fate loves  me as well, and she is doing everything for me… Just as Hanon did for  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is what she wanted me to know…” Skeith fell to her  knees and placed her hands on the ground. “These are the feelings I’ve  lost…” Slowly she hugged herself. “Hanon… I’m sorry… I didn’t realize  it till now…” Her voice broke as her tears started to fall. “I’ve done  so many horrible things…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not important right now.”  Nanoha knelt down in front of her. “You are realizing it, that’s what  matters. You feel sorry for it, something that would make Hanon be  proud of you. Keep these feelings, keep them in your heart. The love  Hanon gave you, the feeling of what’s right, and friendship.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Friendship…They’re all dead…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  true,” The words made Skeith look up at her. “How about one to start?”  Nanoha offered her hand to her. “Lets be friends…Aura.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl  slowly reached up to take the offered hand. “My name…It’s been so  long…” Their fingers touched each others, illuminating the area in a  bright light.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate?” Nanoha opened her eyes, realizing that she was no longer inside her own soul. “Fate! Are you okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha…?” Fate looked at her. “Is it you…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes…Yes honey, it’s me.” Nanoha hugged Fate close. “Did I hurt you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No…  just weak…” Fate gave her a smile before shakily wrapping her hands  back around her. “Its really you…” She sobbed out loudly, embracing her  harder. “I missed you! Nanoha!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” She coughed out, crying  into Fate’s hair. “I missed you too! So much!” The black armor around  her slowly dissolved back inside of her, replacing it with the soft  white and blue fabric of her own jacket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Welcome back, my master.” Raising Heart spoke up as the self locking seal was removed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanohaaa!!!”  The crowd of people all ran towards her at once, hugging and prying the  girl off other people to hug her themselves.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ow, hey, it hurts!”  She protested lightly as Yuuno pulled her off of Signum and gave her a  bear hug. “I missed you too, hey stop it!” She felt Shamal pull her off  Yuuno and grip her tightly, only to be shoved away by Chrono who also  hugged her. Finally after everyone seemed to settle down she noticed  one more person who was standing slightly away from them. “Vita-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vita  was blinking rapidly, shoulders lightly trembling. “I don’t need to hug  you,” She protested, voice obviously shaking. “I told you we’d protect  you didn’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha knelt down, opening her arms. “Come here,  Vita-chan.” The words struck the girl hard, breaking through her last  defenses and allowing her to freely cry and run into her arms. “There  there, Vita-chan, I’m okay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha! Nanoha! Nanohaaaaaa!” Vita  sobbed loudly, hugging the woman harshly and rubbing her face against  her while gripping her shirt tightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mommy?” Caro asked, finally getting through the barrier and to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro-chan!” Nanoha lifted an arm to allow the girl to share in the hug. “Aw, my two little girls!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  other members of the forwards smiled, allowing the oldest friends to  settle themselves down before also walking over and welcoming back  their teacher.</span></p>

“So it’s  under control?” Shamal asked as she continued the examination of  Nanoha. They were alone in the hospital wing currently, undergoing the  post mission physical and check up. “Do you feel anything at all from  the jewel seed?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, but it’s nothing like it was,” Nanoha replied,  shivering as the cold metal piece touched her bare chest so Shamal  could listen to her heart beat. Once done, she continued. “She won’t  try to take me over anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How can you be sure?” Shamal stuck a plastic type strip on her forehead to take her temperature.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I just am. She doesn’t need to be sealed anymore. She’s sleeping.” Nanoha put a hand over her heart. “She’s tired.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I want to examine you every day regardless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha gave her a light smile. “Come on, I’m a tough girl, I’m fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The tone of voice made her wince. “…Yes ma’am… but can I please get dressed, I’m awefully chilly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine, fine. I’ll continue the rest of it tomorrow. I’m sure you just want some sleep about now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, please.” Nanoha began to get dressed. “Thank you for the check up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Always dear. Remember, Every day. I don’t care when.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes  ma’am.” Nanoha slid up her miniskirt easily and zipped it. “… I think  I’ve lost weight.” She turned around in front of the full length mirror  in the examination room. “I did… a good ten pounds.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should eat healthy,” She told the girl. “Make sure your body is okay, you know how much magic strains us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes,” Nanoha turned and saluted her playfully. “Can I go to my girlfriend now? Pretty please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shamal  smiled at her. “Sure, go ahead.” The woman had to bite back a laugh as  Nanoha literally ran to the door and pounced Fate once outside of it.  “Make it quick, I need to examine Fate as well, she was cut pretty  badly.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Man what a  day,” Nanoha sighed out as she collapsed onto her bed. “ Ahhh….. My  bed… how I missed you.” She felt Fate sit down next to her and gently  rub her back. “Mmm… I missed that too…”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s all really over?” Fate asked her softly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes. Don’t worry anymore. Everything is fine.” Nanoha rolled over onto her back and pulled Fate down on top of her. “Hold me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Always,” Fate gripped her tightly, pulling her close. “I’m never letting go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t want you to.” Nanoha cuddled her. “The loft looks great, by the way. Nice and clean and inviting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate couldn’t help but laugh a little. “I cleaned for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you.” She kissed Fate lightly. “I really want to stay up talking but I’m so, <em>so</em> tired…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sleep.” Fate allowed a single happy tear to roll down her face. “If I cry any more I’m going to dehydrate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nyahaha.”  Nanoha’s laugh made Fate pull her even closer. “Owie, I’m really sore,  Fate-chan.” She still allowed her to cling to her despite the words.  “You didn’t have to beat me to a pulp you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I tried to use the best strategy you would use,” Fate told her happily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Beat them up and then talk to them when they’re so weak they can’t move.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  giggled to herself. “Worked wonders on you, after all.” She kissed her  nose. “Now, back to that sleep thing we talked about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,” Fate reached up and cut off the reading light above their bed. “Sweet dreams, Nanoha.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmm, sweet dreams, Fate-chan.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha  looked around, realizing she was once again in the pure black area  within her own mind. The tone of a tuning fork came to her ears, making  her turn around to see a woman with lightning yellow hair and eyes  looking at her. “…Aura?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” She confirmed sadly. “I have something I need to tell you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is it?” Nanoha walked over to her, worried. “Is everything okay? You look sad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know you’re blaming yourself for what I’ve done,” Aura spoke softly.  “It’s my fault I killed those people, not yours.” She looked down a  moment. “I’ve come here today to atone for my sins.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aura  closed her eyes. “I’m tired, Nanoha… I want to rest.” Her hands  extended, forming a yellow ball of energy in them. “Take this…It’s my  atonement.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What…?” Nanoha reached forward, touching the energy and gasping as it was absorbed into her body slowly. “…A…ura…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  teach you how to phase shift,” She whispered, a tear coming from one of  her eyes. “So you can use it to rightfully stop people who hurt others…  that is the data seeds of Signum and Fate, the only two that I  collected. With that you will be able to change your form and power to  mimic theirs. I know you’ll use it rightfully.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I feel… something else…AURA!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  third form… is my own: Skeith, the soul reaver.” She smiled despite  being sad. “You see, I’m actually not very smart… I thought about it  for a long time and this is the only solution I could come up with.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aura, no! you don’t have to do this! You changed, its okay now!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aura  slowly started to fade away. “I give my life to ask forgiveness for  those I have taken. This is my final will. Be free of worry, Nanoha… I  will take all the guilt along with me… Goodbye.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aura!” Nanoha screamed out, feeling the energy slowly sink into her own soul. “Aura…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">On  the bed, Fate smiled to herself when Nanoha’s arms gripped her tighter.  She snuggled her back against her girlfriend’s front, not knowing of  the tears that drowned in her hair.</span></p>
