<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It wasn’t going to be  one of my good days, that much was certain. Waking up this morning  was one of the hardest things I have ever done, and that’s saying a  lot considering how many times I’ve pushed myself up on the  battlefield. My whole body felt weak, numb and my eyes refused to  focus on anything around me. Brushing my teeth and getting dressed  took me almost twice as long as it normally did, even with Fate not  being there to talk to. I had slept in to almost six in the morning,  which was normally the time the training started for my forward  soldiers. Now I was flying to the practice field, barley able to hold  myself up in the air. The training area already had the imitation  city on it and the sight made me smile despite how awful I felt.  Seeing my students take it upon themselves to start training without  me being there really made my heart warm.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha landed roughly  on her observer’s stand and weakly moved her hand out in front of  her after catching her balance. “Good morning everybody.” She  greeted them hoarsely. Disregarding her voice, she continued. “Sorry  I’m late, I had a little trouble getting out of my apartment this  morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No problem!”  Subaru grinned at her through the screen. “We were going to try  some target practice but none of us know how to work the computer  that well so we just decided to go with combat.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Nanoha  typed a few commands out. “I don’t think I will be able to join  you today so I will just observe.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you feeling  okay?” Carol spoke up as she leaned forward to look at the display  in front of her. “You look a little dazed, Nanoha-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I feel fine thank  you.” Nanoha smiled at her. “I appreciate your concern.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Okay,” The pink  haired girl didn’t look like she quite believed her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well then,” A few  more buttons were pressed and simulation enemies appeared in the  city. “Your mission today is to eliminate thirty targets. Use  whatever methods you want but be sure to finish within an hour.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s one target  every two minutes!” Tia cried out in shock. “Even if there are  four of us, they’re always set to be slightly above our skill  level!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha smiled at them.  “Then I’ll give you sixty five minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>She’s a slave  driver!</em>’ Subaru winced. ‘<em>Even if we’ve progressed more  than twice the rate of other people at our level…</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Up to it?” Elio  asked as he looked at the targets hovering above the ground in front  of him. Light rain drops started to fall around the group.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It will be difficult  now,” Carol replied uneasily as the rain picked up almost  instantly. “A morning shower won’t last long but it’ll still  cover the time we have to finish this… I’ll give everyone water  repellent magic to keep us from getting bogged down with rain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you!” Subaru  gave her a thumbs up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Carol is always  handy,” Tia agreed as she loaded her twin pistols.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ready?” Nanoha  asked from the display. The students all nodded at her sternly. “Go!”  her hand pressed a button and the machines all took off. With the  video display of herself gone the instructor of the group brought a  hand to her mouth and swallowed thickly. ‘<em>Why did it have to  rain today of all days?</em>’ The wind blew around her harshly,  making the drops of water sting against her skin. ‘<em>Of all the  technological advancements on this planet you still have to have some  type of device to hold to simply block rain… and mine is at my  apartment.</em>’ She shivered as the rain beat against her and for a  moment debated going into the training field to sit in one of the  buildings. The idea got better and better and when she finally  decided to do it she realized that if she moved right now that she  was probably going to throw up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I knew you would  forget to bring it this morning,” A voice came up beside her and  the rain suddenly stopped beating on her. “I swear, sometimes you  really worry me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha looked to the  side to see Fate standing next to her, holding in her hand something  that resembled a handle that extended up to form a clear  semi-spherical shield above them that blocked out the water.  “Fate-chan,” She greeted woozily. “I thought you had officer  stuff to attend to this morning?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Cancelled due to the  flu going around. A few of our members can’t show up so we just  postponed it to a few days down…the...road… Nanoha-chan you don’t  look good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You look pretty too  when you’re sopping wet,” She teased as she made use of her  friend being there and leaned up against her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really, are you  okay?” Fate shifted her umbrella and put a hand against her  friend’s neck. “Nanoha you’re really hot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It wasn’t a  compliment.” She shifted the shorter girl around so she could look  at her better. “Nanoha-chan, are you feeling okay? For real?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine,” Nanoha  stood up properly to prove her point, but ended up falling over a few  moments afterwards. The blond tried to catch her as best she could  but both ended up falling to the wet ground. “Nyahaha… I slipped  in the water.” She found that laying down was a lot better than  standing up so she decided to stay that way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-chan? …  Nanoha-chan!?” Fate shook her lightly. “H-hey! Nanoha-chan!”  The umbrella was dropped quickly in favor of holding the panting  girl. “Say something!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nyahaha….” She  looked up at her with flushed cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate waved her hand  out, getting a few displays in the air. “All of you continue your  current task and when you’re done use the rest of the day to rest  your bodies. Something’s wrong with Nanoha-chan so I’m taking her  to Shamal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Will she be okay?”  Subaru asked as she pressed her back against a pillar to avoid the  beams being shot at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, she’s a  tough cookie.” Fate let the displays fade and scooped up her  friend, who was trying to protest. “Shush, you’re going straight  to a bed and a change of cloths.” The girl hovered lightly in the  air and sped through the rain. Fortunately the doctor’s office  wasn’t far from the training ground so the trip didn’t take very  long at all. Cold air greeted the pair as they entered, making Fate  shiver since she was more wet than dry.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m going to throw  up,” Nanoha muttered, curling her body up against Fate’s as best  she could while being carried to try and find some warmth. “You  have about…. Thirty seconds to put me down…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As pleasing of the  thought of putting her down to avoid such a scenario was, Fate  pressed on, flying down the hallway and giving the receptionist an  apologizing look for leaving the trail of water in her wake. Upon  entering Shamal’s normal room, the blond looked up startled since  they didn’t bother knocking. “She’s about to lose it,” Fate  called out as Nanoha covered her moth and swallowed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right there,”  Shamal pointed to the side towards the bathroom with her pen, as if  this was nothing new to her lately.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate managed to get her  friend to the bathroom with just enough time to get the girl’s  sopping wet hair out of the way before she lost whatever breakfast  she had eaten that morning. “You could have at least got your  ponytail going this morning…” She made a face when Nanoha coughed  a little. “Ew, gross…” She tried better to keep the hair out of  her way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“S-sorry…” Nanoha  breathed shakily a moment before leaning back over. “Not again…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blond closed her  eyes and gave her friend a few moments to recover before looking back  over at her. A deep feeling of worry filled her chest as Nanoha  simply nodded and allowed herself to fall over to the side, too weak  to even keep herself up anymore. “Hey now…” Fate reached over  and helped her back to a sitting position. “Here, let me clean you  up a little…” She got a washrag from the stack of them on the  counter and wiped her friend’s face off with it. “There you go…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks…”  She  fell against her and panted. “I’m okay now, please take me back  to the training field.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate actually laughed  out loud. “Oh yeah, we’re going right now.” Lifting her, she  carried the girl back into the main room where Shamal was cheerfully  awaiting them by a bed. “Here you are Nanoha-chan, lay down.” She  sat the girl on the bed and looked at her weakly allow her head to  roll to the side. Seeing her friend so tired made her instantly lose  the humor and get serious. “I’ve never seen someone look so…weak…  just from the flu?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, Nanoha-chan is  a special case,” Shamal sighed, hooking up something to the girl’s  wrist to take her pulse. “Most everyone here is used to the flu and  although they still catch it, their bodies are used to fighting it  off… Since Nanoha is from a medium-technology planet that’s never  had to encounter our diseases before…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s more  vulnerable to them, huh?”  Fate took her friend’s hand between  hers and rubbed her thumbs over it. “She was already asleep last  night before I got home so I didn’t get to talk to her. I was a  little worried that she was in bed a few hours earlier than normal  but…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…’N dun forget…”  Nanoha muttered, making both of them look at her. “Su…ru… load  car….’an Fate…. Blueberry muffin…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate blinked. “Isn’t  it a little too early to have hallucinating flu dreams?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shamal was more amused  by the sleep talking than the weird dream the girl was having. “She’s  just cold and confused I think.” Leaning over, Shamal moved the wet  hair from Nanoha’s face. “Nanoha, wake up for me please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The brown haired girl  opened her eyes slowly. “Are we there already?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Shamal lied  happily. “They’re training really hard so I need you to try hard  for me too okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“… ‘kay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell me how you  feel, and be honest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl looked at her  a little confused before moving her eyes across the room and trying  to get her bearings. “I’m cold.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh wow, how did she  even manage to <em>get</em> to the training ground this morning?”  Fate wondered aloud as she gently stroked her friend’s hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Her body probably  just gave up after she got sick just now and everything crashed on  her all at once.” Shamal pet the girl lying down. “Does your  tummy hurt?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about your  joints?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How cold are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m hot.” Nanoha  looked rather uncomfortable. “I’m sweating.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shamal blinked. “Hot  flashes? That’s not good.”  She watched the girl’s body shiver  even though she just complained about being too warm. “Let me get  her some medicine and then take her straight to bed after a warm  shower. She’ll be a little weird to deal with until the medicine  kicks in. Combination of being sleepy and sick, she’s just a little  confused.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.”  Fate  watched over her friend until the doctor came back and handed her a  small bottle of pills. “Anything else I should do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Try and get her to  eat, keep her warm, lots of fluids, the usual you know.” Shamal  gave her another bottle of liquid medicine. “And you need to take  two table spoons of this every twelve hours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What for?” The  blond looked at the clear bottle and frowned darkly when she turned  it over and saw the liquid inside move like a thick molasses.  “Eww...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Its grape flavor,”  Shamal informed her happily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why do I need this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you won’t get  sick as well. I trust you were vaccinated?” She received a nod.  “Good. Then I’m almost a hundred percent confident you’ll get  out of this perfectly fine as long as you drink that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl sighed. “Yes  ma’am.” She scooped up her friend who was already asleep once  more. “As unorthodox as this is, do you mind if we go through your  window?  I’d rather get her out of the rain and into some clean  cloths as soon as possible, not have to run around the building…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll keep this  between us,” Shamal winked as she waved her hand. One of her large  glass windows de-formed, allowed them access to the outside. “But  only this once okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate smiled. “Thanks.”  With that, she flew up slowly and exited the window, quickly making a  beeline to her balcony, which was a straight shot from that angle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Those two are such a  bad influence on me,” Shamal mused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girls landed on the  balcony a few moments later and were inside the loft apartment soon  afterwards. “We’re home,” She told her friend as she walked  over to the bathroom. “We’re going to take a shower okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I just took one,”  Nanoha protested weakly. “I need to go train…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You were in the rain  silly girl.” Fate sat her friend down on the walk-in shower floor,  too afraid that she would fall over to allow her on her feet or  anywhere else. “Undress.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not in the  mood,” Nanoha closed her eyes and leaned against the shower wall.  “Maybe later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate felt her cheeks  color a little, wondering just what Nanoha thought she had meant when  she said that. A few minutes later she finally managed to pull the  last article of clothing from her friend before setting the shower  heads and the water temperature. “I guess we’ll go ahead and get  clean too since we’re warming you up.” Fate sat on her knees with  the sick girl in front of her, directly under the six shower streams  falling on them. “I’ll wash your back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm…” She nodded  sleepily and allowed the girl to do just that. Slowly the time went  by and after she had her hair washed, Nanoha simply gave up trying to  sit still and instead leaned back against Fate. “I don’t feel  good…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you going to get  sick again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nuh-uh,” She made  herself comfortable by resting against Fate’s neck and shoulder.  “Can we stay like this for a little while?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,” The girl  shifted awkwardly so her legs went on either side of Nanoha and her  arms around her stomach. “Is this okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah…” She  leaned back more against her. “Being held by Fate is always okay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“D…Don’t say  things like that when we’re naked…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?” Her voice  was getting sleepy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because…” She  couldn’t come up with any reason that didn’t make it sound  perverted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nyahaha…” The  giggle was weak, but still made Fate smile lightly and cuddle the  girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well… I guess its  okay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” Nanoha  closed her eyes and put her hands on top of Fate’s. “If I go to  sleep, will you carry me to bed?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I will,” She felt  her lips turn up into a smile. “Although I need you awake to dry  you off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll sleep wet…”  her voice trailed off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate sat there  contently holding her friend while she dozed off. The serenity of the  situation began to get to her as well, forcing the blond to cut off  the water before she fell asleep along with her. Nanoha regained  enough of her senses to properly dry herself off but still had to put  an arm around Fate to make it to their bed before collapsing onto it.  “Stay awake for a bit okay? I’m going to get you some water, do  you think you can eat anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not right now…”  Nanoha sprawled out on the bed, making Fate instantly flush dark red  and look away since the towel had fallen from her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“O-okay!” She  hurried to the bathroom quickly, filling up a glass she grabbed from  their nightstand along the way. Once back, she helped her friend to a  sitting position and fed her the pill. “Good girl. Sleep now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sleep with me?”  Nanoha weakly kept her eyes open. “Please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um… Bardiche?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes sir?” The  mechanical device answered promptly from its place on the nightstand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What does my  schedual look like?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All clear.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All clear? Bardiche,  check again, I should have several things on it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Doctor’s excuse  for Fate T. Harlaown and Nanoha Takamachi last three days for Fate  and six days for Nanoha, sir.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“… Thanks Shamal.”  Fate looked down at her friend, who was still looking at her through  half closed eyes. “Okay, Nanoha-chan. I’ll sleep with you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yay,” She smiled,  reaching out a hand for her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate took the offered  hand and allowed herself to be weakly pulled into bed, where she got  under the covers with her friend. At first she went to make herself  comfortable but soon found Nanoha’s hand around her stomach and  cheek resting against her chest. “Na-Nanoha-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hm?” The arm she  was laying on reached out a little until it found Fate’s hand,  where she interlaced their fingers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“U-um… I don’t  mind cuddling with you but…we’re both naked right now and well…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Does it bother you?”  Nanoha looked up at her quizzically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“N-not really…It’s  just that…” She blushed furiously when her friend slid her leg up  against hers, almost straddling her thigh now. A cute content sound  made her realize that the brown haired girl next to her was already  going to sleep. ‘<em>She’s sick...’</em> her mind told herself  repeatedly. ‘<em>Don’t you dare think dirty thoughts!’</em> Nanoha’s hand on her stomach shifted as her body turned more on its  side, ending up with it placed on top of her breast. ‘<em>She’s  sick and asleep… don’t think dirty thoughts…</em>’ With a  yawn, Nanoha stretched out lightly, unconsciously groping her. ‘<em>Oh  god, I’m going to have a nose bleed...’</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate was awoken rather  unceremoniously an hour later when the girl laying on her suddenly  decided to scramble off and crawl to the end of the bed, where she  fell into the floor. Coughing sounds made Fate instantly wake up and  dart towards her friend who had her hand tightly over her mouth. Her  heart melted at the sad scared look Nanoha was giving her. Quickly  she helped her stumble into the bathroom, where the poor girl sank to  her knees and proceeded to attempt to throw up but not quite  succeeding. After almost a minute of panting and coughing Nanoha  finally fell back against her room mate and looked up at her with  watering eyes. “You okay…?” Fate asked softly as she wiped away  the tears.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No…” The girl  closed her eyes and winced as her breath caught in her throat. “It  hurts…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate leaned forward and  kissed her forehead. “I know sweetie. You’ll get better soon, I  promise. Think you can go back to bed?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know,”  She replied honestly. “I feel it coming again…”  Nanoha  whimpered lightly, allowing Fate to help her lean forward again and  cough harshly. “Ow…” She sniffed sadly. “I have …nothing  left…why am I doing this still?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blond rubbed her  back soothingly. “Just your body trying to do what it can…okay?”  After getting a nod she once again took the girl into her arms and  carried her to bed. “You need to get covered, can you sit up for me  a moment?” another nod answered her and Nanoha held herself up as  promised. A light pink nightshirt was placed over her head and once  her arms were threaded through, she allowed herself to fall over onto  her back. “Just a moment dear.” She looked at her sadly before  grabbing the liquid medicine on the night stand and measuring out her  dosage. “It’s eight now so I’ll take my next dose around dinner  time…” She spoke to herself as she looked at the small plastic  cap/measuring cup. “…Here’s to health.”  She took the  medicine quickly, disappointed at how slow the syrup-like substance  left the container and into her mouth. Once she swallowed thickly  several times the girl coughed and went to the bathroom to drink as  much water as she could stand to get the taste out of her mouth.  “Grape flavored my ass…”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate looked up as a  monitor display appeared to her side, the black screen proudly  declaring that Shamal was trying to contact her. The girl set down  the book she was reading and stroked Nanoha’s hair lightly before  ‘pushing’ the button on the display to accept the call. “Hello  Shamal,” She greeted her.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello there Fate,  how are you doing?” The doctor smiled at the sight of Nanoha laying  on the couch with her head on Fate’s lap. “And how is my favorite  little sick girl?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m almost  twenty,” Nanoha muttered out, opening one eye to look up at her  friend. “I’m not a little girl anymore, Shamal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw, but you always  came to me for everything! It was so much fun watching you grow up  with Fate and Hayate!” Her face fell a little when Nanoha was  apparently too weak to tease back. “How are you feeling?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dead,” was the  simple response.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s been  dry-heaving all day,” Fate informed her. “She refuses to eat  anything because she’s scared she’ll throw it right back up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My, that’s not  good. Nanoha-chan, try to eat something okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.” She replied  against Fate’s stomach, curling up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With a sigh, the girl  on the screen crossed her arms. “Can’t be helped then. Fate-chan,  she’ll probably be starving tomorrow sometime so try and take  advantage of that to feed her something really nutritious okay?  Preferably soup to ease her throat and some type of bread or crackers  to help settle her stomach.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes ma’am.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you take your  medicine as well?” The look on the blonde’s face was all the  answer she needed. “You’ll thank me later. Oh! I talked to Hayate  already, and your squad has been given leave for three days, then  Fate will take over training until Nanoha is ready to return.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll be there  tomorrow,” The brown haired girl muttered, half asleep.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate gave Shamal a  small nervous look. “I’ll keep an eye on her so she won’t try  to go anywhere... She won’t let go of me, actually, so it’s no  problem.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmhmm,” She  agreed. “When she sleeps she holds onto me for a while then gets  hot and pushes me away but when I get out of the bed, she’ll call  for me mentally when she wakes up and realizes I’m not there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw, how sweet!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl’s face  tinted lightly. “A-anyway…” She didn’t think of it like that  before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, I have other  patients to check in on so I’ll cut this off here.” Shamal gave  Fate a break on teasing. “Get better soon Nanoha-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl in Fate’s  lap gave a small hum before closing her eyes again when the monitor  cut off. “Fate-chan, I had the weirdest dream just now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Fate went  back to stroking her hair, happy to have Nanoha to talk to. The day  was almost over now and the only conversation she’s had with her  friend was nothing more than random gibberish and sleep talking.  “What was it about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha took a slow  steady intake of air. “I was caught in a rock-slide on some random  planet…I was trapped under the stones and survived for three days  off nothing but water brought to me by a lone Mexican jumping bean…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate looked down at her  friend a moment before reaching over to the table stand and picking  up the medicine she was taking. “What is <em>in</em> this stuff?”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Groggily Fate helped  her friend back to the bed, where they both collapsed down in a heap.  The blond shivered as her counter part panted out, a light shine of  sweat on her body. They had just returned from another one of  Nanoha’s sudden sick moments, where she managed to successfully  lose the small bit of toast Fate had forced on her a little earlier.  “Fate-chan…” She panted out weakly. “I’m hot…”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The air is on  sixty-eight honey… You won’t get better if you freeze to death.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chaaaaan,”  Nanoha sniffed. “I don’t want to be sick anymore…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The red eyed girl  sleepily pushed herself up and looked at the clock on their  nightstand. The digital timer told her that it was currently two in  the morning, a whole three hours since their last trip to the  bathroom. “Come on sweetheart, get in bed properly and cover up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha made a few  unintelligent sounds, showing that she was already drifting back off  to sleep. She opened her eyes lightly when she felt herself being  moved and gave her friend an apologetic look. “Hold me, Fate-chan?”  She asked softly when she was properly laying down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I thought you were  hot?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I need a  hug…please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Always.” Fate  moved over close to her and held her friend. “Whenever you need a  hug, just open your arms.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you…” She  closed her eyes lightly and cuddled up against the blond. “Ne,  Fate-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate opened her eyes  slowly, giving across the room and running her fingers through the  girl’s hair. “I love you too, Nanoha-chan.” The words made the  girl happy, as she was suddenly gripped a little tighter. “Now go  to sleep before you start saying weird things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Loving Fate isn’t  weird,” She whispered, moving back just enough to tilt her head up.  “We’re both girls, but that’s okay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re sleep  talking again, sweetheart.” Fate closed her eyes. “Please don’t  get my hopes up like this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was a small  silence before Fate suddenly felt herself being kissed. Her eyes  snapped open and looked down nervously at the girl who was pulling  away lightly. The two gazed at each other again before the blue eyed  girl smiled and cuddled back up against her chest. “Good night.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Yeah. Good night,  Honey.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha giggled as best  she could. “I like that pet name…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl held her sick  friend and ran the words over and over in her mind. The smile came to  her lips slowly, but she didn’t want to resist it. ‘<em>She loves  me…</em>’ Her mind told her ecstatically. ‘<em>Now… If only  she’ll remember saying it tomorrow…</em>’ The thought made her  lose a little of her hope but the lingering taste on her mouth kept  her spirits up. ‘<em>Wait a minute…</em> Suddenly Fate’s face  looked a little grossed out. ’<em>Why did our first kiss have to be  right after she threw up…?</em>’ She wiped her mouth regretfully,  trying to get rid of the thought. ‘<em>Mou! This isn’t fair!</em>’</span></p>
