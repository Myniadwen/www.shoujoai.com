<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author's  notes: This is the revised chapter three. I corrected a few things that  I saw, took out some things that made characters seem a little OOC, and  hopefully made it better all around. Although I know I'm not perfect, I  do hope you will enjoy this new and improved chapter, now almost triple  its original length.</span></p>

Looking over at Fate  asleep in bed one last time, I walked out onto the balcony of my loft  and closed the door back silently. The dark morning light washed over  me as a soft breeze blew though my hair. It was a little chilly, as I  was only clad in a tight, black, form-fitting spandex outfit. The  suit covered my shoulders but were sleeveless at the same time. It  ran down my body, covering everything, down to just a little below of  what I would consider mid-thigh. Red marks looped around my hips and  ran between my legs and two triangular strips danced across my chest  as well, making my breast look bigger than what they actually were.  Fate had chosen the work-out uniform for me and I had chosen one for  her as well, although it was white and blue. With a small hop I took  to the air and instantly felt better and more alive than I had been  the past day or so. The wind caressed my body as I flew towards the  weight-lifting center across the lake and more in to the central part  of the base. Landing softly, I took a long intake of fresh morning  air and walked inside the huge building, preparing to give myself a  great workout. “And just what do you think you’re going to do  here?” Shamal’s voice instantly asked as I walked in, making me  stop in mid step and start to sweat. Not even five seconds in and I  was already busted…
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Diamond  Dust III</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By:  Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do hope my  favorite little injured person wasn’t thinking she was going to  work out and hurt her arm and possibly throat now was she?” Shamal  asked happily, putting her hands on Nanoha’s shoulders from behind.  “No, no, surely not.” Nanoha looked over her shoulder and gave  Shamal the best innocent look she could muster. “What’s that? You  want to come back to my room so I can give you a proper physical that  you have been avoiding for a month now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The brown haired girl  shook her head quickly and stepped away, turning to face her  properly. Bringing both hands in front of her, she clasped them  together and bowed her head, as if asking permission. “<em>Please  Shamal,</em>” She thought to her. <em>“I haven’t done anything in  two days, I’m going to be so out of shape!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-chan, you  could binge on pizza and ice cream for a month and still be in better  shape than most people are in after boot camp. Why do you always  insist on pushing yourself so hard?” Shamal crossed her arms. “I  worry, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I’m sorry,</em>”  She apologized, looking as if she actually meant it this time. <em>“But  really, I’ll be good; I promise! You can even watch!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No means no.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>At least let me  job so my legs will stay in shape? Nothing to hurt my arm while  jogging right?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And get your heart  rate up and make you breathe fast? No.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>But unless my  heart rate goes up, it won’t be an exercise!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your hear rate went  up last night and just look what happened.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The images of Fate  being above her, panting her name flashed in her mind a moment just  before she also recalled frantically grabbing for her inhaler.  Defeated, she hung her head and allowed Shamal to escort her outside  once again.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate sighed out as she  looked at her schedule, wondering on just how she was going to be  able to keep up with the amount of stress her body would endure while  she took over training Nanoha’s students on top of her normal  duties. “So busy…”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I heard you were  getting busy last night, too.” A voice spoke up as she passed  someone without even seeing them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Turning to address the  speaker, Fate’s cheeks instantly darkened. “Signum! You know!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aah.” Signum  pushed off the wall and stood in front of her, looking down into her  eyes. “If you have time to molest Nanoha then you have enough time  to spar with me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wasn’t molesting  her!” She instantly defended, trying to decide if running off and  hiding to cover her embarrassment was an option or not. “I  was…well…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Trying for third  base going by what I was told.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Signum!” Fate  looked down, holding her clipboard close to her chest. “Stop it;  you’re embarrassing the life out of me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Signum put a hand on  Fate’s back, giving a gentle nudge to encourage her along her way.  “I can sort of understand how you feel, though. I mean, you must  have been sexually frustrated for months now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh my god I can’t  believe you said that!”  Fate looked down more, letting her hair  cover her blushing face which was now spreading to her ears and neck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The pink haired woman  smiled in satisfaction, knowing that if she pressed on just a little  more she could probably get the girl next to her to break into a  nosebleed from all the blood rushing to her head. “Well,” She  went on, deciding to give her a break. “Since we’ll be dueling  today while you’re teaching Nanoha’s class I’ll forgive you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wait, we’re what?”  Fate looked up and over at her, shocked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yup, a demonstration  of a real battle,” Signum went on, patting her on the back.  “Looking forward to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I can’t today,  I have to-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Think of what to  tell Chrono when he finds out his little sister was making Nanoha  scream out her name in throws of pleasure?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She most certainly  did <em>not</em> scream my name!” Fate informed, stomping her foot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He doesn’t know  that,” Signum grinned. “What say, 03:00 hours?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re <em>blackmailing</em> me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yup!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh you are <em>so</em> dead!” Fate stormed off, leaving the very satisfied girl behind  her. The girl’s anger slowly faded as she made her way down the  hallway and by the time she reached her desk it had subdued to just  being embarrassed by her words. When lunch time reached her, Fate was  already having a hard time keeping the smile from her face. ‘<em>I  get to fight her again!</em>’ she mentally screamed with joy. ‘<em>It’s  been so long! Oh I can’t wait to show her my new moves!</em>’ Of  course she wouldn’t let <em>her</em> know that at least.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha looked at the  milkshake in front of her and boredly drank from the straw while  keeping herself propped up on the table with her good hand. Her  throat protested the movement caused by swallowing by giving her a  rough scratchy feeling despite the cool treat sliding down. With a  sigh she chewed on her straw without much interest in finishing her  meal, despite her stomach protesting furiously that it was starving.  ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When I can chew again, I swear I’m going to find the biggest,  fattest steak ever and tear it to shreds…</span></em>’ Her stomach  growled and she forced herself to gently suck some of the shake,  mouth throbbing with a dull pain.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You okay?” Elio  stood next to her. “You look a little spaced out.” The young boy  got Nanoha’s classic smile and a pat on his head for asking. “Are  you going to come watch Fate train us today?” The girl nodded at  him. “Great. I’m going to head over to the training ground right  now, want to come?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha instantly stood  up and tossed her half-finished drink in the trash. With a quick nod,  she walked with Elio to her favorite part of the base. She was a  little surprised to see Fate there, already in her barrier jacket,  stretching. “<em>Fate-chan?</em>” She mentally sent out to her  friend, making her look around. “<em>You’re early.</em>” Nanoha  waved her hand above her head to let Fate see where they were.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After a wave in  greeting, Fate watched her adopted little brother and girlfriend walk  up to her slowly. The last few steps were jogged by Elio and he stood  in front of her, saluting.  Before she could help it, Fate reached  out and ruffled his hair. “Ah, sorry.” She suddenly remembered.  “I forgot you don’t like that while we’re on base.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay,” Elio  looked away, a smile still on his face. “No one is around to see  it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I saw it,” Signum  mentioned, dropping from the sky and startling the young boy. “Hello  Fate, Nanoha, Elio.” He nodded to them each in turn. “About  ready, Fate?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Fate  nodded, seeing Subaru skating towards them in the distance. From  another direction Tia was walking with Rushie, the two apparently  having a happy conversation together. “Nice, everyone is here  early.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha felt her chest  get tight. All her students were at class almost a full hour early,  each looking like they were excited about today’s training. When  they all reached her and her friends, Nanoha opened her mouth to  speak to them but ended up coughing a few times and resorting to her  inhaler to settle herself down. Dejectedly she sighed out and hung  her head, instantly getting several people to try and cheer her up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, let’s get  started,” Fate called their attention and gave Nanoha an  encouraging squeeze on her shoulder. “Since Signum has so  sportingly agreed to come today and have a practice match, this  lesson will be on following your enemy’s movements. Also, since  most of you use the cartridge system, it would be a good idea to  notice how we use them in actual combat. There is a difference in  having plenty of time to charge an attack in battle simulations and  being in an actual battle itself.” The blond looked over at Nanoha.  “Instructor, if you would, please give us a field to battle on?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The brown haired girl  looked reluctant, but still summoned forth a city-type battle field.  “<em>Fate-chan, please don’t hurt my training ground…</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come,” Signum drew  forth her necklace and in a flash Lævatein was in her hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right,” Fate  gripped Bardiche tightly, instantly making a sick looking scythe burn  into life with energy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha swallowed down  her fears and allowed her two friends to fly into the make-shift  ‘city’ training ground before waving her hand and making several  screen displays appear around both her and her students. “Please  observe,” Raging Heart spoke Nanoha’s mind. “Learn well, and  improve.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate landed on top of a  building, perching her feet on the antenna sticking out from it so  she could have a clear view of the area beneath her. Signum stayed in  the air several yards away from her, watching with narrowed eyes.  ‘<em>Bardiche,</em>’ Fate directed her thoughts to her weapon,  making the energy flow in it increase ever so slightly. ‘<em>This is  what we’ve been waiting for...’ </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes sir,” The  weapon agreed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two opponents met  eyes for a brief moment before they were instantly in close range  combat, a blur of their past selves fading out from where they had  dashed from. Lævatein clashed harshly with Bardiche, slinging  flares of energy ripping through the air between them. The stalemate  ended quickly, each lashing into strikes while circling each other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate swapped her hand  positions in mid swing, gripping the sword between two of the  pulsating energy outputs. With the new position she twisted her body  and tugged hard, flipping Signum over her body and following her with  a wide arc kick. The blow landed on her stomach and shot the  pony-tailed woman downwards at an angle, smashing clear through a  building before finally stopping in the next one over. Not pausing,  Fate lurched to the side and narrowly avoided several delayed magical  spears that cleaved the air where she was just flying.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve improved,”  Signium noted, appearing behind Fate and slipping both her arms under  Fate’s before locking her hands behind the girl’s neck and  pushing her down into a choker hold.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Short ranged  teleportation?” Fate coughed out, struggling to free herself from  the hold. “You got new moves!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did you think I  would come back empty-handed?” Signum twirled around to try and  disperse the momentum Fate was trying to get by spinning. “Allowing  to get yourself- nnnf!- trapped, Fate?” Signum grunted while trying  to keep her hold until the girl would pass out. “Guess you got soft  cuddling too –nnng!- much!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t think so!”  Fate screamed, lunging downward towards Signum and slashing Bardiche.  The pink haired girl barely had time to whip her body around to avoid  being cut in half.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shocked, Signum looked  at the thing she had just been holding and smirked to herself.  “Substitution magic?” She asked, pushing away the giant Fate-  sized blow up doll that looked as if she was holding one of her  eyelids down and sticking out her tongue. “So you’ve learned a  few things as well have you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When Nanoha-chan  learns new magic, I’m the first one to get taught, even before the  military.” Fate and Signum circled each other in the air once more.  “You could say I’m kind of a teacher’s pet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, does she pet you  too?” The words made Fate blush, giving her just enough opportunity  to flash forward and clash her blade against her opponent’s.  Quickly they exchanged melee blows, twisting and curving their bodies  to avoid being cut while still moving their weapons in an attempt to  cleave the one opposing them. Finally Signum managed to land a lucky  roundhouse against Fate’s arm, shooting her several yards away  before she caught herself in the air. “All nice and limber now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate stretched out in a  giant ‘X’ formation before rotating her arm. “Aah,” She  imitated Signum’s speech habits, smiling. “You?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very much so… Well  then, shall we for real?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let’s shall.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Back on the ground and  safely outside of the magical barrier, Nanoha bit her lower lip in an  attempt to work out some of her nervousness. So far her two friends  had been stretching their limbs to prepare for their fight, something  that her students apparently didn’t know. With a quick glance to  her side, she saw the four of them watching several monitor displays  of the battle. Elio was trying to break apart every move made and  figure it out while Rushie was talking to him, offering her advice on  the magic and if they would ever be able to do it. Subaru was acting  more like a cheerleader, punching the air in excitement and cheering  on Fate. Tia simply looked dumbstruck at the talent she was  witnessing. In all, Nanoha was sure that her students would leave  today with a much more real knowledge of the term “overpowered and  outclassed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Load-” Fate began,  thrusting up Bardiche.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Cartridge!” Signum  finished, pointing Lævatein towards her enemy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The initial blast did  no less than decimate the immediate surroundings by the two females.  Bodies blurred to the human eye and magical energy roared furiously  within the transparent dome surrounding them. Time and time again the  barrier flinched, struggling to contain the raw energy flying around  inside of it. Nanoha swallowed, pondering on just what condition her  friends would be in after the duel was over. In the past they had  never been known to hold back anything while fighting each other, and  from the looks of the current warpath raging in front of her, this  time was no different.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Two empty shells were  shot from Bardiche as the blond screamed out, slashing her scythe out  repeatedly. The strokes looked harmless, as Signum was far enough  away to be in no danger of them connecting. This didn’t stop the  other girl from instantly going on the defensive, however, as she  took to dodging the attacks as if she were right in front of the  girl. The moves sped up and finally, on the very last stroke, Fate  got her speed up enough to add the one extra twist that broke through  her opponent’s movements. Grunting out, Signum felt her left  shoulder be blasted by the unseen force attack. As she panted, the  woman allowed her eyes to inspect the damage, not surprised at seeing  her barrier jacket completely torn there, as well as smoke coming up  from her broken barrier. The blood was light, but still to be able to  cut through not only her barrier, her auto barrier, and her armor in  one swing served to make the pony tailed girl only be prouder of her  rival.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate panted, eyes  searching for any signs of attacks coming back at her while Bardiche  was temporarily stunned as the excess magical pressure was released  from its system. “Snake form!” The words caused an instinctive  reaction from Fate, shooting her high into the air to try and get  away from Signum’s classic move. To her utter disbelief, the coils  of chain and steel managed to get above her, starting to loop around  and cut off any chance of escape that she might encounter. “You’re  mine!” Signum screamed, pulling the sword hilt back and tightening  the chains.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Four shells were loaded  into Bardiche on its on accord, giving it enough power to change its  master into Sonic Form as well as shift itself into Zanber form.  Fate’s world became slower in motion, each heartbeat pulsing deep  within her ears. The air was still and the sword links seemed to be  hung in mid air, ever so slowly continuing along their path. The girl  had to remind herself that time hadn’t slown down, but she herself  had sped up, and if she didn’t move, and soon, then the conversion  to her speed form would be pointless.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-chan, what is  going <em>on</em> over there!?” Hayate’s voice suddenly screamed, a  large image of her appearing on top of all the other displays in  front of the girl on the ground. “Do you have any idea of the  number of calls I’ve been getting about a disturbance in your  training ground!?” Nanoha waved her hands as if to say ‘It’s  not my fault’ and turned the display around so Hayate could see the  battling girls. “Oh not again! Stop them this instant, if they keep  on then the barrier will collapse!” The brown haired girl scratched  her cheek while Hayate continued to freak out. “Nanoha-chan,  please!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>They’ll tire  themselves out soon,</em>” She spoke mentally to her friend, feeling  a small drain from her power as she used long-distance mental  communication’s magic. “<em>No need to get hostile with them?”</em> Nanoha waved her hand, putting Hayate’s image to the side so the  girl could also see her displays. “<em>We’re recording this, we  could maybe even use it as some sort of battle simulation program in  the future? How to fight an S-class mage maybe?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate gave her a  begging look. “Nanoha-chan, that’s not the problem everyone is  worrying about!” large teardrops came to the corner of her eyes as  she pleased. “Stop theeeeeemmmmmm!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate dodged quickly,  feeling the tip of Signum’s blade lightly run across her side.  Bringing her own sword up, she slashed once. The swing missed its  intended target, but still continued on, as if the very air itself  was sliced from it. Countless buildings were cleaved in half,  crashing onto the ground with shattering glass and breaking concrete.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Signum twirled in the  air, flipping over Fate and hanging upside down. Her sheath clamped  onto the end of her sword handle, merging with it. ‘<em>In that form  I can barely keep up with her…</em>’ A bow string appeared as Fate  righted herself from the move, pulling the heavy sword up so she  could hold it properly again. ‘<em>That sword is too heavy for her,  so she is using her sonic form to ensure that her defenses aren’t  open after a wild swing… If I can make her lose the sword then I  won’t be in danger of any long range aerial disruptions…</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Eyes widening, Fate  turned around just in time to see several shells launching from the  now formed bow. “Damn it!” The words barely escaped her lips as  the arrow was fired. Catching it on the wide blade of Bardiche, the  girl was hurdled backwards through two buildings before cracking  against a cement support column in the third. Sliding down it slowly,  Fate coughed up a little blood. ‘<em>Not good… I think I  dislocated my shoulder from that attack… In this case…</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Signum flew into the  building quickly, seeing Fate now wielding her scythe again with one  hand. Pressing forward, she engaged before the girl seemed to have  her wits about her again. Slashing quickly, she managed to off-set  her and land a round house, slinging the petite girl into the wall,  where she landed roughly, not moving. The pink haired warrior walked  towards the un moving body slowly, panting roughly from all the  magical energy she had been using the past half hour. Normally her  battles only lasted five to ten minutes, and this extended full power  play was starting to eat into her core, as well as her cartridge  supply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The air around them  grew dark as thunder roared loudly outside the building. Rain  instantly started falling and lightning cracked furiously around  them. Signum paused, looking around. ‘<em>Wait a second; it  shouldn’t rain inside the barrier…unless!</em>’ With a flip of  her sword, she sent Fate’s un-moving body up into the air, where it  slowly floated down. This dummy doll was smiling at her broadly,  clearly part of Fate’s sense of humor. As she flew quickly outside,  Signum looked up in the sky. The real Fate was in the air, gathering  a massive ball of lightning with her device. “You little  trickster…” Signum grinned to herself, loading four shells into  her sword. “Don’t you dare think I don’t have a counter for  that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha gasped loudly as  she observed the screens in front of her. ‘<em>That kind of power  will blow the barrier to pieces!</em>’ she thought quickly, looking  over at Hayate, who seemed to be having a spaz fit. Fate, having  plenty of time to summon the energy needed, slung her attack  downwards to her opponent. The motion made Nanoha grin despite  herself. The teacher in her couldn’t help but notice that the girl  had rather nice form.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The explosion was  ear-shattering. Chunks of debris and rubble from the now plain  training field flew thick around the area, revealing the two forces  still clashing, now with melee moves since their magic powers were  almost completely gone. “Ah, that last blast damaged the training  ground!” Hayate cried out. “That will take weeks to fix!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Raging Heart was  already in Accel Mode, aiming at the two girls in the sky. “<em>I’ll  blast them both down in one shot!</em>” Nanoha’s mind screamed out  after seeing her precious training ground hurt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Count X,” Raging  Heart stated, magic circles embracing its body and extending the  distance. “Count  IX. count VIII, count VII,” Elio, knowing the  attack, grabbed Rushie and slipped her into his arms, running away.  Subaru and Tia, both shocked at the amount of energy being displayed,  stayed right next to her. Two cartridges fired from Raging Heart  next, making pink glowing feathers rip around them as an after  effect. “Count N,” The device finished. “Starlight breaker.”  Nanoha narrowed her eyes, ignoring Hayate screaming at her that she  was probably going a bit overboard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blast immediately  slung Subaru and Tia into the air from the force of it, making each  bounce once on the ground before rolling a few times to a stop. The  energy flared dramatically into the sky, breaking into a large  explosion when it collided with the two flying girls in the air.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When the attack faded  and the air around Nanoha stopped sparking with energy, she made a  face while looking at her arm, which was throbbing dully in pain. Two  large splashes followed, each from their respective duelist.  “Mouuuuuu!” Hayate yelled at her. “Nanoha-chan, do you have  even the slightest notion of how much I am going to have to BS to  cover your little temper tantrum!?” She got a soft smile in return,  as if she was apologizing. Sighing out, Hayate sat down at her desk.  “Okay, punish them however you like. I’ll just say you were  demonstrating how to break through a barrier and a magical limiter  not working properly… You owe me for this!” Hayate looked to the  side as several monitors appeared by her, demanding to be addressed.  “You owe me <em>two</em> for this!” she added in, looking as if she  was about to cry. “A huge banana split sundae! With all the  toppings, you’re treat!” The screen blipped out from view just as  Fate crawled onto the land from the water, coughing lightly. Signum  followed her shortly, panting out as she pulled herself up to a  standing position.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Both girls looked at  each other uneasily, cloths torn in several places and magically  drained from maintaining their device’s auto shield from Nanoha’s  attack. The image of said friend stepped up to them, glaring hard.  Two seconds were given to them to brace themselves before the  frustrated girl instantly lashed into a mental scolding on both of  them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio blinked, watching  Nanoha throw out her arm in frustration before stomping her foot and  leaning forward. The girls in front of her recoiled in shock before  each bowing repeatedly as Nanoha continued on. “That,” Elio spoke  to Rushie, who was still holding onto his arm with one hand. “Is  the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life.” They continued to  watch the silent scolding and Nanoha’s over dramatic body movements  that stressed her anger.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Are you still mad?”  Fate asked, peeking out of the bathroom and over onto the bed, where  Nanoha was already curled up, hugging a pillow. When she didn’t get  an answer back –mental or no- she quietly crept through the dark  room and crawled into bed next to her. An attempt to touch the girl  backfired when Nanoha scooted away, puffing out her cheeks. “Come  on, don’t be like that…” Fate crawled a little closer to make  up for the distance and tried again, this time being able to rub her  arm. “It’ll be fixed before Shamal releases you to full duty  again, don’t worry.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou,” Nanoha  muttered out. “You destroyed… my training ground!” The liquid  medicine Shamal had forced her to gargle a few hours ago did wonders  for her mouth, allowing her to speak in short burst without even her  tongue protesting.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just shorted it  out,” She reminded, sitting by her and encouraging the girl to roll  on her stomach so she could rub her back. “Don’t be mad at me  Nanoha…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,” She chose to  leave her answer at that, closing her eyes and mentally deciding that  if the backrub was good enough she would forgive her friend. “Keep  rubbing… I’ll think about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Pleased at being spoken  to again, and actually <em>hearing</em> the words, Fate straddled her  friend’s waist and scooted the shirt upwards so she could properly  massage her back for her. “How was your check up?” She continued  to run her hands over her friends back a while longer before she was  responded to.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good… Shamal said  I should… be able to speak properly… tomorrow sometime if… I  kept using the inhaler and gargle…that god-awful stuff… for as  long as I can… stand it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nodding, Fate leaned  over and gently kissed the back of her friend’s neck. “Get better  soon.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll try.”  Nanoha sighed contently. “Keep rubbing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My hands are tired,”  She protested faintly but continued to do as she asked. “I’ve  been doing this for almost ten minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like three,” She  countered, getting comfortable. “Consider it punishment for…  breaking my beloved training area.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So having your  beloved’s hands fall off is better?” Fate pondered aloud.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re a strong  girl.” Nanoha nodded to herself and enjoyed the rubbing along her  back and sides a moment longer before Fate took it to her arms, being  careful of the bandages, and finally paying special attention to her  neck. “That’s wonderful…” She breathed out, feeling herself  get drowsy. She felt Fate’s hands go back down her spine and  proceed to rub out the tight spots on her leg muscles as well. “I  see why you… like this so much…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t get used to  it, then I won’t be rubbed anymore,” The blond protested, finally  going back to straddling her waist and leaning over so her front was  touching Nanoha’s back. “There, I’m done. My hands can’t  stand anymore.” Nuzzling their cheeks together, Fate asked again.  “Forgive me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose,” Nanoha  agreed finally. “But if you do it again… you’ll have to rub my  back more… and a foot massage would be… nice as well.” She felt  her friend get comfortable, still half laying on top of her. “Cuddly  tonight?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe,” Fate  answered evasively, wrapping a hand around her girlfriend’s stomach  and trailing a finger along it. “Be sure to get lots of rest  tonight, I have a surprise for you tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Nanoha  embraced Fate’s hand, keeping it from tickling her. “What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If I told you, it  wouldn’t be a surprise now would it?” With a giggle she gave her  friend a re-assuring hug. “Just wait for it. Until then, sweet  dreams.” Fate closed her eyes and allowed her cuddle toy to get  comfortable before settling down as well. She got a sleepy good night  in return and soon they were both asleep.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Subaru walked down from  the residential area of the 6th division’s section of  the base with a light yawn. It was Sunday, which meant she had the  day off from training so her body could rest. Despite this, however,  she found herself only able to sleep in until seven in the morning,  which was still an hour and a half later than she normally got. Upon  exiting the building she made her way across the grounds and pondered  on what she was going to do for the day when something bumped into  her, almost making her fall over. “Ah, sorry,” A voice greeted,  hand going to her shoulder to help steady the girl. “Wasn’t  looking where I was going.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay,” She  dismissed it, looking at the person. The male was blond with glasses,  long hair flowing out behind him in the wind. The golden strands were  kept neat by a green silk ribbon, tried in a bow near the base of his  neck. What Subaru noticed the most, however, was the person was  wearing civilian clothing. “Are you here to visit someone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, actually. I was  asked to visit the mess hall to find him when I went to the building  over there.” He pointed to the office building a little ways off.  “But thing is, I don’t know <em>where</em> that is since this is my  first time on this section of the base.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, well,” She  grinned; not like she had anything better to do than show the cute  man around. “Its right over there, I’ll walk you if you want?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That would be  great!” He smiled at her, pocketing the small map of the base he  had held in his hands. Together the two made their way back to where  Subaru had originally came, this time -however- She went into the  main frontal part of the building instead of the side door which she  exited from.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please be on your  best behavior,” A guard greeted them at the door. “Admiral Chrono  Harlaown is visiting his family here today.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru almost went  stiff at the knowledge. The entire mess hall was almost quiet, voices  kept low as if not to bother the extremely high ranking member  inside. Looking over the room, she spotted the admiral near the far  side close to the large glass windows that looked over the lake.  Almost no one sat close by him, probably too afraid they would offend  the man in some way and get de-ranked. Although she had heard that  Admiral Chrono was a nice person, she didn’t dare want to interrupt  his time with family. When she realized that Fate was sitting across  from him, facing towards the rest of the mess hall, she felt herself  get even more nervous. Fate was training them currently, which meant  that <em>might</em> get to shake Chrono’s hand later on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh nice, there he  is.” The blond male said happily, walking past the guard and  heading over to where Chrono and Fate were.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wh-wait a moment!”  Subaru hissed at him. “Don’t go near them, it’s rude!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nah,” He laughed,  still walking over to the almost empty part of the room. He caught  Fate’s eye and held a finger up to his lips. The girl acted like  she didn’t notice him and returned her look to Chrono, now with her  lips slightly upturned into a playful smirk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you going  to do?” Subaru whispered, trying to get the male to come back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Standing behind Chrono,  the man waited until the admiral in front of him took a drink of his  orange juice before grabbing his shoulders. “Hey Chrono!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chrono instantly jerked  in his chair, spilling his drink a little and almost spitting it out  all over the girl in front of her. Fate broke into laughter, having  to cover her face to save herself from getting too loud. Subaru on  the other hand could only think one thing as the admiral turned  around to glare at them. ‘<em>Oh sweet god, I’m about to be court  marshaled.</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno!” Chrono  gasped out, standing and saluting the boy, previous actions already  forgotten. “You damn ferret, how you been man?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Great!” He saluted  back playfully. “Fate told me you were going to be here as well so  I came looking for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Chrono  looked at the woman beside him, who immediately went ragged and  saluted quickly and solidly. “Who’s your friend?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno looked over at  her, seeing the girl too scared to speak. “Actually, I never got  her name,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Private Subaru  Nakajima!” She instantly declared, looking straight ahead of her  into Chrono’s eyes. “Time-Space Administration bureau’s 6th  mobile division, under the care of Flight instructor Nanoha, sir!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At ease, Subaru.”  Fate leaned over to look at them. “We’re all friends here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re in Nanoha’s  unit huh?” Chrono mused, looking her over. “You’re still in one  piece, I guess she learned to control herself after these years.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sir, yes sir!”  Subaru saluted again since she was once more being spoken to. The  back of her mind told her that Nanoha still had temper tantrums when  she got upset but she didn’t dare voice those thoughts aloud, let  alone to the youngest person to ever reach admiral ranking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno!” A sudden  new voice filled the room. Before anyone could move, the sandy-blond  found himself tackled from behind, making him take a step forward to  regain his balance. “Oh my gosh, Chrono too!” a brown ponytail  flipped over Yuuno’s shoulder as the girl who had tackle-hugged him  let go and hugged Chrono next. “I haven’t seen you both for  ages!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha,” The two  males greeted her happily, each getting another hug.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru was in another  state of shock as she listened to them talk with each other a moment.  When Nanoha asked Yuuno how the infinite library was going, she  instantly let out a small yelp when the pieces clicked together.  Yuuno Scrya, head of research and chief librarian at the infinite  library. Alongside Chrono, the boy received more honorable mentions  than anyone else around him, even having captains of ships fight over  possession of him into their ranks. “S-sir!” Subaru saluted him  now. “Please forgive me for my rude behavior earlier, sir! I didn’t  know who you were!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno blinked a moment  before turning to Nanoha and pointing at her. “Is she always this  nervous and strict?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually, she’s  normally the one disregarding the rules,” Nanoha replied nervously,  taking a puff from her inhaler before continuing. “I think she’s  just nervous for some reason.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, you’re the  trouble maker Nanoha keeps talking about!” Chrono realized, making  the blue haired girl sweat lightly. “She said you reminded her of  herself all those years back.” Looking over at Nanoha, Chrono  smirked. “Man you were a lot of trouble. At least Fate followed the  rules and orders.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh as if!” She  countered. “Fate-chan broke more rules than me, she just didn’t  get caught!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Which means they  never happened,” Yuuno nodded to himself. “Or at least they  didn’t happen after I erased them from the log books.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I <em>knew</em> that  was you!” Chrono pointed. “I should have you court marshaled for  doing that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh just try it,”  Yuuno crossed his arms and glared playfully. “Make one move and  I’ll use my network to place your picture in the ‘anything goes’  section of the universe’s sleazy magazines, boy love of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chrono’s face paled.  “Right then,” He cleared his throat. “Anyway, Nanoha, I heard  you were hurt?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, what’s up  with that?” Yuuno pondered as well, putting a hand on his hip.  “When Fate called me I hurried over as fast as I could, and you’re  already bouncing around like always.” He pointed to her inhaler  that was still in her hand. “And that is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My inhaler,” She  grinned lightly, moving to sit at the table, making everyone else  also do so. “Long story short, I inhaled something I shouldn’t  have. This thing keeps me going.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And the magic  monitor device around your neck?” Chrono put his chin on his hands  in front of him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, this thing?”  She pointed at her neck where the cheerful green necklace was slowly  circling. “Shamal is monitoring my breathing. I think I’m  completely better, but I’m still using this breather-thingy until  it’s empty, just incase.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And your arm?”  Yuuno looked at Nanoha’s arm. “Fate said you were wearing a  sling.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah… I’m kind of  supposed to be…” She grinned lightly. “But I really don’t  think its necessary… Wait, Fate-chan told you all this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aah,” Chrono  nodded, ignoring Fate waving her arms lightly in an attempt to make  him be quiet. “She told me that you were mad at her so she got the  ferret and me to come visit to try and cheer you up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh really?” The  girl turned to look at Fate. “Was you that worried I’d make you  sleep on the couch?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No…” Fate looked  down, letting her hair cover her blush. “Well… Maybe a little.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nyahaha.” The  brown haired girl leaned over and kissed the blonde’s cheek. “Thank  you, Fate-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh god they’re  getting all huggy again.” Chrono sighed. “Gag me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Leave me alone, I’ll  cuddle if I want to,” to prove her point, Nanoha scooted closer to  Fate and slid underneath her arm, so it was around her shoulders.  “Nyaaaa.” She stuck her tongue out at the boys, who were chucking  to themselves. “Oh, by the way, we have news for you two.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We do?” Fate  pondered, looking down at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes we do,” She  confirmed before looking at the males. “Fate-chan and I are dating  officially now!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This time Chrono really  did spit out his orange juice on the girl in front of him. “You’re <em>what</em>!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ewww, gross!” Fate  whined.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Congratulations!”  Yuuno added in at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wait, you’re gay?”  Subaru asked before she could stop herself. “Oh wow, that’s so  cool!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Half-gay,” Nanoha  stuck out her tongue while her girlfriend cleaned herself up. “Guys  are still hot too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like me,” Yuuno  added in, leaning his chair back on the hind legs. “People thought  we were dating for years.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, that sucked.”  Fate agreed, pouting. “I got jealous sometimes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of ferret-boy?”  Chrono pointed to his side. “I can handle my sis being gay since  you obviously look happy, but I can’t cope with anyone being  jealous of him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At least I didn’t  knock up a girl when I was twenty!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chrono’s eyebrow  twitched lightly and his body shifted, as if he just moved his leg.  The next moment, Yuuno let out a yelp as his chair flipped over  backwards. The rest of the people looked at him suspiciously, but his  face remained impassive. “What?”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“So this is the  training ground, huh?” Yuuno asked, looking around as they walked  onto the blue hexagon ground. “It’s supposed to create solid  virtual reality situations isn’t it?” He shifted Nanoha lightly  as they walked, as she decided to ride him piggy-back style since  they haven’t seen each other in months.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It does, yes, when  it’s not broken.” Nanoha looked over at Fate, who flushed. “It’s  top of the line in battle simulation!” She continued to rant about  the details that her training field had, once more slipping into her  ‘gaga-over-gadgets’ mode.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She seems to be  fine,” Chrono spoke to Fate, looking out into the lake. “You  seemed really upset when you called me so I was worried.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry. Thanks a lot  for coming.” Fate smiled up at him. “It’ll do her good to see  everyone again. You weren’t here for the worst part of it, but she  lost her voice and use of her left arm for two days. She can talk  fine now, but Shamal still has her on a strict no-solid-food diet  just incase she coughs while eating she won’t get anything lodged  in her throat and choke. Poor girl has been living of fruit smoothies  and milkshakes.” She covered a giggle. “I caught her last night  sneaking into the kitchen to eat some brownies but I stopped her…  She made me sleep on the couch for the rest of the night, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hehe, so you <em>did</em> get kicked out of bed.” He smirked. “That’s awesome.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou, you’re  supposed to be supportive, <em>brother</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, <em>okay!</em>”  Yuuno cried out, sweating lightly. “Nanoha honey you’re talking  my ear off again, and that’s pretty bad when I can’t even follow  along with you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey!” She pouted.  “I haven’t been able to speak for days, cut me some slack!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll cut you some  slack all right. Right into the water!” Yuuno walked over to the  edge of the field and turned so Nanoha was hovering above the clear  blue liquid. “Don’t make me drop you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll take you with  me,” She warned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With a grin to his  friends, Yuuno let go of the girl on his back. At first he braced  himself incase she tried to pull him in as well, but found that she  simply gripped him harder, arms circling his neck and choking him as  she held on for dear life. It didn’t’ take the book worm longer  than six seconds before he reached behind himself and grabbed  Nanoha’s legs, hoisting her back up onto his back and panting out.  “You tried to <em>choke</em> me!” he accused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You tried to <em>drop</em> me!” She teased back at him. “Serves you right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh yeah?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno jogged a little  bit into the training ground before stopping and facing the lake.  “Then get ready to go for a swim!” Gripping her hard, he ran full  speed towards the water, making the girl on him gasp out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll get soaked  too!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Try me!” Yuuno  leapt into the air, letting the force carry him sailing. When he  didn’t dare risk it anymore, he closed his eyes and changed shape.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha gasped out as  the person she was holding onto suddenly vanished. She felt a small  bump against her chest and when she looked down, she saw a ferret  falling under her, barely grabbing a hold of the edge of the grounds  and scrambling up before he sank. The next thing she knew, Nanoha  splashed into the water. It took her a moment to comprehend what was  going on before she swam to the top and broke the surface. “You  cheater!” She accused, watching the animal shape shift back into a  human. “No fair!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Laughing, Yuuno walked  over to the edge and offered his hand to the girl. “Oh come on,  that was funny!” Smiling at her, the boy helped his friend up out  of the water.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then don’t forget  to laugh,” she cooed, pushing her feet against the edge of the  ground and forcing herself backwards. Her friend yelled out before  falling as well, landing in the water along with the one he was  trying to help up. When the two resurfaced, Nanoha splashed him  happily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You little tramp!”  Yuuno went to splash her back, but stopped when he heard the  uncontrollable laughter coming from their two friends.  Yuuno met her  eyes and the two hopped up onto the solid ground and grabbed Fate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“H-hey!” She cried  out as Yuuno got her hands and Nanoha snared her feet. She felt  herself topple over and be carried between the two over to the edge.  “D-don’t!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“One!” Yuuno slung  her forward, still gripping her. The motion made her rock back and  the pair got more force when they moved the girl forward again.  “Two!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Three!” Nanoha  cheered, slinging poor Fate into the air, where she flailed out  helplessly before splashing into the water.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Upon surfacing, Fate  spit out water and growled at them. “Jerks! I’ll get you for  this!” She turned to look at Chrono, who was covering his face with  a hand, trying to keep his laughing fit under control. Not one to be  out done, she threw out her hand, latching around her brother’s  ankles with a magical binding chain and tugging on it, ripping him  into the water as well. “Ha!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Swim time!” Yuuno  declared, running and jumping back into the water, doing a  cannonball. Nanoha followed him quickly, although jumping on top of  Fate and hugging her in the water, making her blush darkly.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“What a day,”  Nanoha sighed out happily as she sat at the kitchen table while Fate  put up their groceries. “We got to see everyone again, go swimming,  shopping, browse the mall, even ride go-karts and play put-put-golf.”  She giggled to herself at the memories. “Shamal even removed the  collar and allowed me to eat real food for once…” She looked over  at Fate, still laying on her arms. “Thank you for dinner.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t mention it,”  She replied happily. “I knew you would be starving.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I ate enough to make  up for it, though.” She giggled and stretched. “I’ll be in the  living room okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“ ‘kay, I’ll be  there in a moment.” Fate watched her friend leave the room and go  around the corner. When she was no longer in sight, Fate allowed  herself to smile brightly, pleased at how the day turned out. Her  friend was successfully cheered up and she even managed to have quite  a good bit of fun herself. A noise caught her attention next and when  she stopped to listen she heard Nanoha above her, apparently in the  bed room. Moments later she heard her friend descend the stairs and  plop onto the couch. “Want anything before I come in there?” She  called out, putting up the last of their things.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No thanks,” Nanoha  called back, watching the kitchen entrance for her friend. “Go  change cloths and get comfy,” She told her friend as she unfolded a  blanket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,” Fate  noticed that Nanoha had already changed into a skimpy tank top and  boy shorts when she had gone upstairs. Grinning, she went to her  dresser and rooted around, finding the matching set that she had. The  clothing was exactly the same as her friends, only she had a light  blue and her girlfriend had pink. “Any movies on?” She called  out, looking over the balcony as she changed cloths.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not yet,” Nanoha  was surfing the channels “There’s something neat on the military  channel about new weapons.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Figures that’s  what you’d be interested in,” Fate signed. She loved Nanoha to  death, but if she saw anything that was new in either weapons or  magic spells, she had a bad habit of tuning out everything else  around her and focusing just on that. Walking down the stairs, she  stopped and looked at Nanoha, who had a blanket wrapped around  herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The pony tailed girl  looked over at her friend and smiled while making a beckoning motion  with her hand. Fate looked at her with an amused look but still  walked towards her none the less. The motion was repeated and the  shorter girl opened up her arms to spread out the blanket. One leg  was running along the couch while the other was hanging off it,  offering the blond a seat between her legs. Fate decided to take the  offered seat and plopped down with her back to Nanoha’s front,  instantly getting a hug and snuggled from behind. “Caught you,”  She whispered in Fate’s ear softly, bringing her other leg up and  laying it on top of Fate’s closest leg and under her other. “You  can’t escape,” She continued, nuzzling her much like a kitten  would.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re in a cuddly  mood tonight, huh?” Fate giggled to herself, allowing the signs of  affection happily. “So tell me,” she ventured on. “Now that I  can’t escape, what will you do with me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha wrapped her arms  around Fate’s shoulders and pulled her closer, allowing their  bodies to touch. “Snuggle,” She replied easily. “And… one  thing I’ve always wanted to try, if I may?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha gently moved her  nose against Fate’s neck, nudging it so she would lean over and  expose her shoulder. The loose strap from the tank top fell over her  arm from the movement and allowed Nanoha to go about her small desire  undaunted. Very gently she touched her lips to her girlfriend’s  skin in a small kiss. The motion made Fate tense up slightly, closing  her eyes as Nanoha’s lips pulled away, sticking lightly from the  flavored chapstick that was worn. “Is this okay?” She whispered  softly into the ear of the girl she was holding.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Yes,” Fate  slowly brought up a hand from the blanket and reached back, lightly  threading her fingers awkwardly into Nanoha’s hair. Encouraged, the  brown haired girl closed her eyes and once again placed her lips on  the shoulder, slowly kissing up to her neck. Ever so gently she put  her mouth on the soft spot between her neck and shoulder and started  to suckle on it lovingly.  “Aahhh…” The soft gasp of air came  out in a long whisper. “Nanoha…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl only pulled  back when she needed to take a breath, looking at the wet spot where  she had just been, seeing a red mark on the milky white skin that she  was sure would bruise. “Fate…” her hands hugged her tighter,  once more leaning down to kiss a new spot and repeat the motion. A  soft moan came from her girlfriend, the hand in her hair trying it’s  best to massage where it was placed. ‘<em>Tonight,</em>’ She  thought as she rubbed Fate’s stomach in a slowly circle. ‘<em>Tonight  we’ll show each other how much we truly love one another…</em>’</span></p>
