<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author's  notes: This was posted on the animesuki forms when my hard drives were  down. My friend, Haru ( who made the Nanoha Fate Mega Pack ), requested  that I post this on FF.N. Originally it was going to be an SNL chapter  but for some reason I like it too much, so made it into a short story  here. Although I think the quality of writing isn't up to par with my  normal stories, I really think I captured Fate well here. I hope you  enjoy this.</span></p>

It was times  like this that made me remember that I was a soldier. Hayate always  gave me special permission, allowed me to do things that other soldiers  never did... Days off, special spending money, a very large loft  apartment to live in, even let me pick my own schedule out and make  special request. It was the perfect life, always with the ones I loved.  But it was little compared to what we faced in battle. People may  complain about me getting treated too nicely, that the people of  Section Six were soft... But the missions we took... It reminded us  that we were given those things as a reward for our service, the duties  that we do. It made us fight harder, train longer, reach farther... We  had a happy place to return to, we can't die here. We can't die...  Hayate gave us an order: &quot;do not die&quot; and I would do anything for her.

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was a soldier, I was fighting to protect the nameless people on this  planet. The planet I didn't even know the name of... I was fighting and  bleeding for them. Why? Because a relic was here, and someone was using  it to dictate the people... It was wrong; I hated it. People were  free... That is why I fight. But now, right now, it was hard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So  why? Why was I carrying the weight of Nanoha while I walked through  this god-forsaken jungle? Her breath was rasp- she was in pain. I could  feel a small trickle of blood from her mouth roll down my neck. I hated  it. I hated everything. So simple... It was going to be so simple.  Arrive, steal the relic, leave. Let the planet overcome it's own  troubles once they had no overpowering threat to be used against them...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So  simple... Nanoha, who could fight countless enemies at the same time  and not get hurt...Who could fly in the skies with the greatest of  ease... Who could make anyone smile with just a look...Was dieing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">From a war wound? From a grand battle? From saving a child's life? For self sacrifice?... No...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So  simple. She was bitten by something that looked like a snake. That was  it. So simple. Years of training, countless wars, and we were defeated  by an animal I killed in under three seconds. She was fine at first,  laughing it off and saying &quot;Man I hope it's not poisonous huh?  Nyahaha!&quot; I had smiled then, calling her an idiot. We cleaned it, used  our standard field antidote just in case, and went to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  screams would forever be in my mind. Cries of pain, not moving, eyes  glazed...Screaming for me, asking desperately for me to hold her. I  was, She was in my arms, but she couldn't tell... She cried for me,  yelling for me...Asking for comfort... But she didn't feel me, couldn't  see me...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I hated it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And here we are now...walking, carrying her through the thick jungle. Was there a town nearby? Would she survive?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">...I don't know, but I kept moving forward. Because I was a soldier.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was times like this that made me remember that I was a woman. Calm,  planning my route, walking with the weight of my friend on my back. I  had to take care of her, make sure she would be alright after this was  all over. The jungle was thick and suffocating but I still pressed on.  I wanted desperately to take to the air but I knew I couldn't. The  enemy knows we can fly and would have some type of radar to track us if  we went above tree level. Even so, the base camp I was looking for was  inside the jungle itself anyway. I knew where it was, roughly, but to  be honest I didn't even know what way I was facing. If I walked too far  east I would meet an enemy camp... I could only pray I was heading the  right way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So I walked on, hoping it was in the right direction. Bardiche's scan would let me know if I got close so all I can do is walk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  stirred lightly, gasping in my ear weakly. I wanted her to just sleep  but deep inside I wanted to hear her voice again, some sign that she  was still alive. Her words were weak but I still got what she was  saying. She wanted water, something we didn't have much of anymore.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sitting  her down I shifted slowly so she wouldn't fall over and gently moved  her matted hair from her face. &quot;Here,&quot; I spoke to her, giving her a few  swallows of the liquid. &quot;I'm sorry, that's all right now.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Please...&quot;  The single word ripped through me, the half open eyes and dazed look  clearly told me she desperately needed more than what I had given her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;I'm  sorry,&quot; I whispered slowly, forcing myself not to cry. &quot;That's all  right now.&quot; I couldn't look at her anymore. She was in pain, probably  so much that she didn't even understand it hurt anymore. She was sick,  and had several moments when she chocked on her own saliva before  throwing up today. If I gave her anymore she would just lose it and  waste what I had managed to spare... Not that we had much left. But I  had to. She needed me to take care of her. My heart ached as she  pleaded with me, begging in half whispers for more, asking to be sat  down, to rest...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I kept walking. I had to find help. I had to make her okay.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  weight was on me even more, dragging me as I stumbled through the heat.  How long had it been since I had drank anything? A day now? Two?I don't  even know anymore. She needed it...she needed it... I was going to take  care of her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I fell. The ground was damp, sticking to me from the  sweat. Bugs were biting me and my feet hurt so much I knew they had to  be bleeding. The weight on me held me down even more. &quot;Water...&quot; The  voice came again. It hurt...It hurt so bad.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Here,&quot; I gently  moved her and allowed Nanoha to drink the last of it. I also slipped  her our last pill of nutrients. &quot;That's all for now.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;More...  Please, more...&quot; Her eyes weren't open anymore and for the first time I  noticed she had gotten pale. The bitten area on her arm was a deep red  with flecks of white. She couldn't even think anymore other than to beg  me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;That's all for now.&quot; I lied to her as we started walking  again, once more on my back. We had nothing left, I had given it all to  her. She needed it... I was going to take care of her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was a woman, after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was times like this I remember I'm a fool. Stumbling through the trees  with Nanoha on my back had taken its toll on me greatly. I hadn't eaten  anything other than field rations the past three days, and they were  nothing more than a gummy granola bar overly packed with every source  of protein, vitamin, and carbohydrate the body needs to function. I  liked that part, but they never once considered the taste, and I could  still feel it on the back of my throat. With no water to wash it down I  constant gagged when I inhaled too deeply and almost wanted to throw it  up. Fortunately I kept myself from doing so.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Fate,&quot; Nanoha whispered to me softly. &quot;I feel funny.&quot; Her words were weaker than ever. &quot;Am I going to die?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;No,&quot; I honestly didn't know if I was lying or not. &quot;We're almost there. Today, I promise.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Yesterday...&quot;  Her single word made me groan. I had said the same words every day  since it happened and she finally realized that. &quot;If I die,&quot; She  continued to whisper, making me strain to hear her. &quot;You can have my  stuff... Nya...ha...ha...&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Don't even joke,&quot; I scolded her but it landed on deaf ears. She had passed out once again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was such a fool. I kept walking because I knew we would get to the  friendly camp. Why? Because I said so. No other reason. Just because I <em>knew</em> it. The thought came to haunt me even more now. I was an idiot, I  should have drank some of our water, I should have rested more, I  should have eaten more than I did... I should have... should have...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate  smiled at me fondly, offering her hand to help me stand. Yuuno was next  to her with an amused smirk and laughter in his eyes. The two were  laughing at my clumsiness of tripping.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The vision blurred as I saw some insect walk across my line of vision. '<em>Great,'</em> I thought bitterly as the hallucination left me completely. Pushing  myself up, I re-set Nanoha on my back and started walking again, trying  in vain to ignore the vision of section six's halls around me as I  trudged on. The light was flickering as my eyes started giving out as  well. Black spots floated across my vision and hazed in and out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Fate...&quot; My name again, cutting through my weak mind. &quot;Leave me...&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  could... It would be so easy... Just set her down and go on my own... I  would make it then... I could survive... No! &quot;Shut up,&quot; I coughed out,  pressing on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Fate...&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;I love you too much,&quot; I felt the  world spin as I stumbled. My stomach lurched but I bit it down. No  longer could I tell what was real and what was fake. I didn't know  where I was, nor what was going on. All I knew was the girl on my back  needed me to walk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To where? I don't even know anymore. I was such a fool.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">How long? I don't even know anymore. I was such an idiot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Fate...  Fate... FATE!&quot; My name? I couldn't tell... Nothing made sense  anymore...Just keep walking. &quot;FATE!!! FAAATE!&quot; Did I know that voice?  Were my ears tricking me now too?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I couldn't... I can't...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Falling to my knees I let a tear roll down my cheek.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I'm sorry Nanoha... I can't go anymore... I'm so sorry...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;FATE! FATE!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I'm so sorry...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Blackness.</span></p>

When  I could see again the first thing I noticed was my vision was blurry.  The lights hurt my eyes to the point of making me moan. After this I  realized that I was very comfortable. It was strange, sleeping in the  mud with bugs was never this pleasing before...
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Fate?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Nanoha...&quot; I smiled. She sounded so clear now for some reason.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Thank goodness, you're awake.&quot; I felt myself be kissed lightly and embraced. &quot;You were asleep for days.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;What...?&quot; I finally managed to open my eyes fully and look around. The room was familiar, section six's hospital. &quot;How...&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  took my hand. &quot;You did it... You found the base. Tia found us and  carried us the rest of the way. That was almost a week ago.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;You okay?&quot; She helped me sit up and I promptly drank a full glass of water. &quot;I'm starving...&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;I'm  fine, just fine.&quot; Nanoha rolled up her sleeve, showing me a nasty  looking large scar where she was bitten. &quot;I was treated with the help  of some of the locals. I was sick for a while but after the anti-venom  got in me I recovered very quickly. You on the other hand...&quot; She  suddenly looked angry. &quot;The hell were you thinking? You were severely  de-hydrated!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I gave her an odd look and realized that she was diverting her eyes now. &quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;I  don't remember any of it.&quot; She confessed softly. &quot;You saved my life but  the only thing I recall was going to sleep after being bitten...  Everything after that was nothing but a blur of pain.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;I see...&quot; I realized I had an IV in my hand so I hugged her with the only one I had free. &quot;Sorry.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;They  said we walked for days. I was okay, considering, but you seemed really  bad... Shamal said...&quot; She hugged me tighter. &quot;That you had to have  walked for three days without stopping much at all... And from our  rations, you didn't drink much...?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;You needed it.&quot; It was a simple response but it seemed to make Nanoha cry. &quot;Hey, don't do that... you know I hate that.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Sorry.&quot;  Leaning back a bit she wiped her tears. &quot;I love you so much, I can't  stand the idea of you being so kind when you were suffering...&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Mm. I love you too.&quot; The words seemed to make Nanoha only cry more. &quot;H-Hey, what is it?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Don't say that...&quot; With both hands she wiped her eyes. &quot;...Don't say that so casually...&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;I'm  sorry.&quot; I looked down, feeling a cross between wanting to sleep more  and getting out of bed to eat. &quot;I won't say it anymore.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;That's even worse!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I never understood her. &quot;Do you want me to say it or not?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha looked down sadly. &quot;I'm sorry, I'm just... you know. Near death experience...Makes you want to be closer...&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;You can be as close as you want.&quot; I smiled at her fondly. &quot;I wouldn't mind it either.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;The way I want to would creep you out... No, never mind, forget I said anything.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Kiss me?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reaching up, I touched her cheek. &quot;Nanoha... Kiss me. Please?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked shocked for the longest time, making me wonder if I had crossed  the line. &quot;Okay,&quot; She finally agreed, leaning over and doing as I had  requested. &quot;There. You owe me one now.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Then I'll pay you back.&quot; I leaned towards her but found a finger on my lips. &quot;No?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Yes, just later. I want Shamal to check on you. After that... Can we talk? About us?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;If we can kiss again then?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Yes... Lots of times.&quot; Despite her earlier words she flecked my lips one more time before running off to find the doctor.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  liked me. I could tell it as clear as day now. Actually it was apparent  that she had feelings for me for a while now... Why did I never notice  it until we almost died...?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was such a fool.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But no more.  From here on... From here on I'll tell her every day. I promise you,  Nanoha, I'll tell you I love you every day... Count on it.</span></p>
