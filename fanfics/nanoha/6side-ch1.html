<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author's  notes: This story here is a means of diving deeper into my Alternate  Universe known as “6th Division: Rebirth, Reminisce, Redemption”. Since  this world is filled with things not related to the StrikerS series, I  thought I'd take an opportunity to share with you the things in this  universe that makes it original and separate from the other StrikerS  fanfics out there. This will be updated periodically whenever I feel  the need to explain a few things, or to give just a simple deeper view  into the lives of the characters in my 6th Division running storyline.  The following can be a stand alone, but will be rather confusing if you  havn't read Rebirth and Reminisce from me. This takes place between  Book II: Reminisce, and Book III: Redemption.</span></p>

Checking  to make sure I had everything, I pulled my apartment door closed with  my foot and gave Nanoha a grin when she had to bump the down button to  the elevator with her hip. We had all planned a great cook out tonight  and it was already getting started it seemed. Things were finally  settling down around our base so we're taking the time to catch up with  everyone, as well as welcome Lutecia's official acceptance into the  forward lightning group. My fiancée motioned for me to hurry up so I  quickly jogged over to her, careful not to drop the many things I was  carrying. Once inside the elevator she nudge the lobby floor button and  grinned at me, leaning up on her feet to awkwardly kiss my cheek. I  stuck my tongue out at her playfully but sucked it back in when she  tried to take advantage of the situation and kiss my lips. I would be  cooking soon and I didn't want the thought of making out to be on my  mind. She looked a little depressed but after a wink she cheered up a  little and trotted out of the doors and over to her Stars members on  the ground floor before we all headed out to where our little party was  happening.

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  looked at the grill from behind Fate and peeked over her shoulder to  try and get a closer look at the several shish-kabobs. Placing one hand  onto the blond's shoulder, she got the attention there and tried to  sneak her other around to get one off the grill. “Go ahead,” Fate told  her without even looking at the invading hand. “The skewers are metal,  you'll burn yourself pretty badly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You didn't even look!” Nanoha protested. “How did you know?!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  always steal food when you think I'm not looking. Go on, shoo, go talk  to everyone. We're here to celebrate another successful mission.” Fate  pushed her away playfully and smiled at the pout she received. Turning  back to the grill she flipped the skewers around once with her tongs  and wiped her hands off on her apron. “How did I end up cooking anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  you're a great chef,” Chrono informed her from the chair next to the  grill as he watched her take the lounging chair in front of him and lay  back. The sun was starting to set in the backgrounds but several  tiki-style torches were all around them as well as strung up lights and  two large bon-fires. Music played carelessly around the large group as  everyone chatted about nothing in particular. “So tell me,” The man  went on, tossing her a cold one. “When my little sister isn't saving  the universe, what is she up to?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing much.” She popped the top and took a long drink. “What do you want to know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell me your average day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmmm...  I wake up at five-thirty in the morning and lay in bed until Nanoha  pulls me out with a cup of coffee. From there I sit lifelessly at the  living room table while sipping my drink and reading the newspaper.  Normally I don't talk much in the mornings so Nanoha uses this time to  get dressed and go over her schedule. Around five-fifty or so Nanoha  runs out to the training ground, normally out the window so she can  make it in a little under a minute. Hayate scolds her all the time  about it but Nanoha never listens. At six I normally start to actually  wake up and get dressed. I grab the thermos of coffee and head to my  office and normally stay there from six-thirty to eleven.” Fate looked  at the grill to check on her food before continuing. “From eleven to  noon I observe the training forces and offer any advice I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How many training forces are there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Four,  the regular police division is always circulating people for standard  cop trainings. From there you go to the more magically advanced people  who make up the standard military trainings. The third group are  graduates of the military training and are being trained and sorted  into land, sea, or air divisions. That leaves the Forwards, who are  trained by Nanoha directly. Normally Nanoha makes her rounds around the  main base to converse with other teachers about the progression of  their students and more or less chatter about useless things. Anyway,  after that I grab a bite to eat. Sometimes I manage to eat lunch with  the forwards but mainly Hayate-chan and I share a lunch together in her  office. From one to three I patrol the town-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“AKA, run rampet on the streets while looking for people to race later at night.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“-To  make sure no crimes are going on,” She continued as if he didn't say  anything. “From three to five I work out at the gym or spar with  Signum. From end of training until whenever it's done I am back in my  office going over the previous day's reports on all the troops and  divisions and budgets given to me by the leaders of individual  departments.” The blond checked her food again and called out over her  shoulder. “First batch is done!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru was at the grill  instantly, eying the food with a dreamy look. “Fill'er up!” She asked  happily, offering her plate and getting two skewers. “Thank you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We'll  have a lot more, so come back after a while,” Fate laughed as the girl  started attacking the side dishes. “Here you go, Tia, Hayate, Vita.”  She grabbed several more and placed them on the grill. “Where was I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Department work,” Chrono grinned, drinking slowly from his can.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah  yes,” Fate hopped back down and kicked her feet out, leaning back.  “That can take anywhere from thirty minutes to an hour, depending.  Normally I just let it build up a few days and take care of it all at  once or pass it off to my secretary to do for me. After that I jog  around the base until I can't walk anymore and head home. Normally I  get there around seven to eight. I cook dinner most of the time and eat  together with Nanoha before taking a shower and lounging around. I try  to get in bed anywhere from nine to eleven, depending on how tired I am  or how long Nanoha stays up doing her paperwork. And there you go, my  basic work week.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chrono hummed to himself, watching her flip the  food on the grill without even getting out of her chair. “Sounds like a  lot of work. Do missions mess you up much?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very. When I'm given  a mission my day basically goes: Wake up, start researching, training  the forwards along with Nanoha, scouting the area, more research,  sleep. I eat every now and then when I can. On the day of action I  sleep in as long as I can, do the mission, and come back, debrief, and  cook something fancy for us for dinner.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Haha, you like cooking don't you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  really do. Normally I'm the one who always cooks our meals, and on  Firesday if everyone is at the base I'll make dinner for all the  forwards.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I heard Hayate gives you a day off after every mission? And Nanoha takes every Firesday off as well doesn't she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm.”  Standing, she called out her second batch and loaded up more plates,  tossing more from the never ending pile they had all chipped in  together to make onto the grill. “After a mission I normally lay around  the apartment and have wild kinky sex.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ugh, please spare me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  laughed happily. “I'm kidding, I'm kidding! Believe it or not, we're  not bunnies like everyone thinks. We make love once a week, sometimes  none. We just don't have time, or we're too tired.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh bull, I've heard stories.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  blushed. “Well, there are exceptions...” Turning the food, she thought  back. “Our record is... I think twenty-some times in one week.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Twenty-some times in eight days!? What the hell, Fate!? That's like...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Three times a day,” She confirmed. “Waking up, a quickie at lunch, and in the shower at night.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chrono put his face in his hands. “I'm going to have nightmares.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No you're not, here.” She offered him a fully prepared plate. “Dig in.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“So  how do you like rooming with Lutecia-chan?” Nanoha asked her daughter  as they all ate together. She was currently sitting at a picnic table  along with Elio, Caro, and Lutecia.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's really fun,” She talked around nibbling on her kabob. “We stay up late sometimes and talk a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Lutecia wiped her mouth off after attacking her food. “It is the most fun I've had as long as I can remember.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha smiled to herself. “Now we just need to get Elio-kun a room mate so he won't be lonely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro shook her head. “Don't worry, we don't let him get lonely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia nodded in agreement. “We normally stay with him once a week each.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ohhhh?”  She looked over at Elio, who was still munching his food. “And what do  you do when you're together, all alone, and no one knowing where you  are?” Her words were playful, wondering what kind of games they would  do together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We sleep with each other,” Caro replied happily, making Nanoha spit out her drink. “Are you okay!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  woman coughed Several times, wiping her mouth off quickly before taking  to trying to get her sprayed juice out of a grossed out Elio's hair.  “That's <em>not</em> what I thought you'd say.” She shook her head. '<em>Clearly my mind is just in the gutter...</em>' Turning to look back at Caro, she continued. “Sleeping together huh? Sounds fun?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  nodded. “The first time was a little uncomfortable but once we learned  how to position ourselves it was really nice.” The girl looked at  Nanoha's shocked expression. “Mommy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I...um...” She shook her head. “I'm sorry, I just got lost in thought... Ne, Elio-kun, what do you think about this...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  blinked and looked up at her a moment before answering around his meal.  “I don't mind; although when they double team me I'm more exhausted  than anything else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The purple haired girl blushed. “I'm sorry, do we keep you up too long? I know I tend to squirm too much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'll be right back,” Nanoha stood up and walked away from them, rubbing the bridge of her nose.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro giggled. “Sleeping at night is fun, but random naps in the day are good too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!”  Yuuno called his best friend over and grinned when she happily came.  “This cook out was a great idea, it's been a while since we could all  just relax.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You said it, lately everyone has been running  around like they were on fire. Amazing how it took a almost two weeks  before we calmed down to get on a normal schedule.” The girl sat down  on a lawn chair and leaned back, propping her feet up and sighing.  “It's even gotten cold before I even realized it. Flying is going to be  chilly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How's Tia's flight lessons going?” The man sat next to  her in his own chair. “You've been with her a lot lately between  training sessions?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She's amazing, actually. Believe it or not  she can keep herself from falling too fast. Once it took her almost two  minutes before she touched the ground when I dropped her. Granted she  was concentrating really hard and was using her body to help her magic  flow, but still. That's way better than I thought she'd do. Most people  take almost three months before they can fly and they're at double A  before even trying. Tia's only B-rank and she's already slow falling  after two months. I'd comfortably call her a prodigy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?”  A new voice asked as Tia leaned between them. Her long hair fell around  her shoulders, taken to being let down instead of her normal pigtails  as if to keep her neck warm. “I'm a prodigy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha sighed out. “Plus one to Tia's ego.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do <em>not</em> have an ego.” She offered the two loaded plates and grinned at their  happy looks. “But I do feel special hearing that, thank you Nanoha-san.  Did you learn to fly really fast as well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sort of,” Nanoha giggled nervously. “Mine was a special case though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How so?” Tia sat across from her in a random chair and started eating her dinner.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno answered for his friend. “She was fighting something that was in the air and I told her to fly up to it so she did.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wait, just like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha blushed. “Um, yeah. Just like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you just...flew... without knowing you even could?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More or less.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia fell back in the chair and just looked at her teacher for a moment in shock. “That's... Amazing!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  male shook his head lightly. “Nanoha is a special case. Speaking of  cases, didn't you tell me you were thinking about doing something when  you turned twenty?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,” Nanoha confirmed. “It's a few months until my birthday on this calender but Fate's is coming up soon.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-san will be twenty as well?” Tia pondered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She'll be eleven.” Nanoha replied absently in thought. Realizing what she said, she waved it off. “Never mind!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate's  voice came up by them as she leaned over to offer the three some  drinks. “I don't mind, they would find out eventually anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You sure?” The blue eyed one looked up at her fiancée.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course, it's a happy time in my life, after all.” Leaning down, she  gave Nanoha a quick kiss to her temple. “If you need more drinks just  holler at me and I'll bring you some.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks, Fate.” Yuuno  raised his can up to her playfully in a little salute. “Well,” He  looked over at Tia. “Fate's life was really rough growing up. You could  say that she never celebrated her birthday before or even knew when it  was. When Nanoha found her I'm sure you know they were enemies at  first?” He got a short nod. “After they had their differences put aside  and after the Precia incident, Fate was left with nothing. Nanoha here  became her first friend. Later when Fate needed to state her age and  birth date for something she realized that she didn't know that  information. So she chose that day on the bridge, when she was talking  to Nanoha and because friends, that would be her birthday. So she will  be turning eleven this coming time around.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha looked down into her drink. '<em>Even  though, technically, she IS only really eleven since she was born and  awoken when her body was nine... and those nine years weren't her  memories after all... But no matter, Fate said it was a happy time for  her now, and she really enjoys her birthday.</em>' Nodding, she added  into the story. “Birthdays for Fate are always extra special because of  that. You could say that it's her favorite day of the entire year” She  took a large bite out of her shish kabob and moaned out happily.  “Fate!” She called out, getting the blonde's attention from her  brother. “These things are GREAT!” Her friend laughed and waved at her  before going back to the conversation. '<em>Fate sure has come a long  way since back then. She went from the shattered girl I first met to  someone who heals others. Having been there herself, she can touch  people in a way that I can't. Even Caro-chan has been saved by Fate  before I could start helping her mend the wounds she had encountered. I  don't think Caro has any long regrets about anything...But then again,  no one but me knows about Fate's sleeping habits, how she has to sleep  with her back to the wall because of painful childhood memories... the  nightmares she has when she sometimes gets to the middle of the bed.  Actually, she can sleep in the middle of the bed, but only when I'm  behind her. I heard from Chrono once that when she stays with him she  still has nightmares even when her back is against him... Wow, I never  thought about it before now...</em>' Looking over at her again, she  smiled fondly at her lover. Fate noticed Nanoha looking at her and  blushed darkly when she realized it was a caring look.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah!?” Turning back to Tia she looked at her and then Yuuno. “Um, what was that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I say, Nanoha,” The male sighed. “You space out more than anyone I know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nya haha...”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“How  was your last mission, Sub-lieutenant Vita?” Subaru asked her  instructor as they sat next to the rather large fire while roasting  marshmallows for dessert. “You were gone for almost a week with  Signum-san weren't you?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah,” Vita confirmed, looking into the blaze. “It went fine, the people causing the trouble were push overs.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It must be hard being sent on long distance missions all the time?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's  not bad, I'm used to it. Don't slack in your training while I'm gone,  though.” Vita pulled back her wire rod and inspected the marshmallow on  the end of it before blowing a few times and eating it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru,  on the other hand, waited until hers caught fire before pulling it back  and crying out. Blowing on it quickly, she put out the flames and  looked at the blackened sugar puff before shrugging and eating it  anyway. “Oh hey,” She licked her lips. “A little char on it taste  pretty good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vita shook her head at the girl but was still  rather amused by her. “How are things with you?” She asked her secret  favorite student. Although she wouldn't admit it to anyone but Nanoha,  she had taken a liking to Subaru over the time they spent together. In  truth, the blue haired girl reminded her of a younger version of  Nanoha. Happy and carefree and full of spirit. Although the woman was  still that way sometimes, most of the waking moment she was doing her  job properly and holding back her random outbreaks of joy whenever  something amused her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Things are good,” Subaru mused while  thinking the question over. “I'm proud of the way I've been advancing  lately, and I've found myself able to stay up a little later at night  and not be tired the next morning so I think I'm going to try and copy  Fate-san and jog a little in the evening before I turn in.” She got an  approving hum, making her grin. “Aside from that, my love life has  gotten better too. Tia is really open with her feelings with me now,  that makes me happy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Quite annoying really.” Vita opposed her. “As if the bunny couple wasn't bad enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We're  not that bad,” Subaru sweated lightly. “We havn't even gone past second  base yet... Well... I've struck out at third a few times...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vita  actually snorted, holding back her laugh. “Don't give up,” She offered  after a while. “Not about third base, but in the relationship. It takes  time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm. I know.” She looked back to the fire a while before spearing a marshmallow on the end of Vita's rod. “Here you go.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“You're  alone, that's rare.” Yuuno's voice made Hayate jump slightly as he put  his jacket around her shoulders. “It's cold already, don't get sick.”  Sitting beside her he looked into the fire. “What you doing over here  all by your lonesome?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl pulled the warm jacket closer around  her shoulders and hid her face between her knees since she was hugging  them anyway. “I don't know, just thinking I guess. Ever since we  started this division it's been one thing after another. From hunting  down triple-S ranked mages to bringing down mad scientist to destroying  entire fleets of drones...I don't know, sometimes it seems that we're  being used by the higher ups just to fight. I made this division so we  could not only hunt relics but also do public safety, to protect  everyone... And we're severely understaffed still. The local police  love us but if we can't get people here to train then it's  meaningless...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We still have a lot of space, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  have thirty non-forward rooms open and each one holds two people. Our  forward rooms are about half full now thanks to Lutecia and you but  still... So much empty space.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We have room for a new training squad? Fate's already pressed driving around the base to inspect the four current ones.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It wouldn't be bad. Nanoha's training schedule is three times a day, seven days a week, at two hours per session.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Six  to Eight, Eleven to One, and Four to Six right?” He thought about it  lightly. “So there are three hours in between her training... so we  could use her training field for the regulars...three times a day, for  two hours, thirty minutes in between the end of one and the start of  the next...That's do-able right? I'll hit up the local police logs and  see if there is over crowding and then have a meeting if I can to see  about a program where all the departments can send up two to three  people each for a few month long training periods.” he grinned at her  surprised look. “Oh come now, don't think I can't handle that on to of  my other work. All you need to worry about is finding a teacher for  them. Nanoha can only be stretched so far you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno...Wow, thank you. I don't know what to say...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When  you're having problems like this, don't hide them.” He gave her a quick  wink. “I love any excuse to research anything, no matter what it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate  blushed a little. “You're still the same after all these years, you  know?” Slowly she scooted over to him more so their sides were  touching. “But ever since you started hanging around my division you've  become a lot more...What's the word?” He tilted his head curiously at  her. “Confident.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Confident?” He blinked. “How so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm  not sure really.” She tried to think how to word what she was feeling.  “You have always been extremely loyal, really dedicated, always willing  to work as hard as you could...but you still didn't seem as if you knew  how much of a difference you really made. Now... It feels like you know  that your work has a meaning and it's influenced you a little.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that bad?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!”  She felt suddenly embarrassed when Yuuno looked shocked at her sudden  loud answer. “Um, I mean no...I kind of.. like it you know.” She  giggled nervously, suddenly finding it hard to look at him for some  reason. “I like you...” She gasped. “I mean I like you like <em>that</em>!  I mean, I like you, like you, like that. Ohh! You know what I mean!”  She hid her face into her hands and felt like dieing. “I'm so  embarrassed right now...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno chuckled to himself, shaking his  head lightly. After a moment he felt a hand on his and looked down  questioningly. Hayate still had her face buried in both of hers, which  made him blink and trail the arm up and found it connected to Nanoha.  Before he could ask she gripped his hand and lifted it up, quickly  placing his arm around Hayate's shoulders. At first he found himself  too shocked to do anything, too worried Hayate would freak out on him,  but almost at once the smaller girl leaned over just a little bit,  resting her head against his neck and shoulder. The man felt his cheeks  color slightly, thankful it was already too dark to notice. Nanoha  waved at him silently and walked off back to the rest of the group.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha,” Arf called out, running over to the woman and hugging her leg. “Where have you been?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Arf-san!”  Nanoha reached down and picked up the little girl and carried her on  her hip. “I was over with Yuuno-kun and Hayate-chan. Have you been  having fun?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yup!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good.” Nanoha smiled at her and used  her free hand to make sure the familiar was properly covered. “Are you  cold? Do you want me to get you a scarf or something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha, I'm not a five year old.” Her voice was amused none the less, as it always was when she was treated like a little girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm sorry, you're just so <em>tiny</em>.  I can't help it.” Grabbing her under both arms, Nanoha lifted the  puppy-girl up into the air. “It's so hard to imagine you used to tower  me by three feet!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Arf laughed at the simple act and held on to her. “You were such a cute little child, what happened?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey!”  Nanoha sat down around the other campfire that still had several people  around it talking non-stop about nothing in general. “So how do you  like it here? It's been a while since you stayed with Fate, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's  great, I missed her so much!” Arf let her legs swing happily as she sat  in Nanoha's lap in a chair. “Missed you too. Hard to believe it's been  so long since you became my Sub-Master.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That sounds so funny,”  Nanoha complained as she always did. “Can't you just call  it...'god-mother' or something? It's not much, I can barely tell you  take some of my power.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because when a familiar has two masters  they only take half of what they need from each, and in this form even  a low ranked mage wouldn't feel much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” She smiled.  “Well, I'm just happy you let me do it. I'd be really worried about you  too if Fate ever got her linker core busted again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm, thank you for caring so much.” Arf gave Nanoha another hug. “And for taking care of my Fate while I'm not around.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure thing, Arf-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So tell me, what do you normally do around here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know you train people but that's just about it, do you do other things as well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh yeah!” Nanoha chuckled. “My day is normally jam-packed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,”  She thought a moment. “Well, I wake up at five in the morning. First  thing I do is kiss Fate on the head, although I'm not sure if she knows  it's part of my daily ritual or not, and then go downstairs to start  making coffee. I get the beans from my shop back home on Earth. Kuhn  always visits my parents and gives them my video letters and picks up  theirs, but he is also really close friends with my Dad so he brings  him a lot of things from Midchilda. Once I found that out I asked if he  could get the coffee beans there since Dad has Fate's favorite blend.  I'm getting off the point ha ha. Anyway, I grind coffee beans first  thing and put them over on my coffee maker to steep. Since I use a  traditional coffee maker it takes a while for it to go through, and I  also fill Fate's thermos with hot water. While it's doing it's thing I  go upstairs and brush my teeth and comb my hair and all that fun stuff.  When I'm done I go downstairs and change the beans to the other half I  ground up and steep a new set. Back upstairs I change into my Training  Uniform, which takes a while because I normally lose one of my  stockings.” She grinned at Arf's laugh. “By now the coffee is done so I  pour Fate a cup and dump the water in her thermos and then fill it up  with coffee.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why did you put hot water into it if you just dump it out?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because it heats up the thermos so when I fill it full of coffee it will stay piping hot. Fate's <em>really</em> bad about not drinking coffee unless it's scalding. It really kind of creeps me out. It can be<em> boiling</em> and she'll sip it like it's iced tea. So anyway, I go wake her up and  give her the cup and pat on the head. By now it's about five thirty so  I start going over my day's schedule while Fate just kind of sits there  a moment and goes to read the newspaper. By the time I'm done and make  sure I'm properly dressed for the day I head out to the training field  and teach the forwards from six-ish to about eight or so. From then  until nine-thirty I have kick boxing training. When it's over until ten  I normally grab a bagel or waffles or something at the café across from  the gym. From ten to eleven I review what the forwards did in the first  training session and then start the second one from eleven till one.”  Nanoha looked up at Subaru when she offered them a small plate with  freshly made s'mores. “Thank you, Subaru.” Taking them, she started  nibbling and allowed her Stars member to listen in on them after  sitting next to the two. “Sometimes we stop early and eat lunch with  the rest of the leaders of Section six but for the most part we take  lunch from one to two. Until about three or so I give Tia daily flying  lessons and then I go meet with fellow instructors. We only have about  half an hour or so to talk but we do it every day so we always get  what's needed to be said done. I hurry over to the training field then  until about six-ish depending. If I wasn't involved in physical combat  that day I'll normally jog the track once just to stay on top of my  game. Every now and then I'll run into Fate but for the most part I  don't see her too terribly often. I get home around seven or so and  Fate normally has a hot meal waiting on me. She'll kiss my cheek and  say 'Welcome home Honey!' and then ask me how my day went and be all  “paya-paya” with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Gag me,” Subaru grinned, obviously not meaning it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha smiled over at her. “And then we have <em>sex</em>,something you're not getting any of, I hear.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey!”  Subaru colored. “It's not like I'm not trying!” When she realized what  just left her mouth she sank back. “...Please don't tell anyone I said  that...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm just kidding,” She went on. “We shower together  whenever we can and then I go about doing my paperwork. It's not much  so I normally just let it pile up on me and do it all at the same time.  One good thing about an instructor is you really only have to plan out  your days and how your students are progressing. I make a weekly  schedule every Firesday so I have more free time than Fate does. She  takes Firesday off as well, though. I guess being best friends with the  leader of the division has it's perks. She looked over at Subaru.  “Since we're talking about it, what do you normally do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, my  day isn't really interesting. Being only a private I don't have any  paperwork to do besides fill out forms after completed missions. I go  running with everyone in the morning time before first training, then  eat breakfast and work with Tia a while before second training. We eat  lunch and I normally train with Vita-san a little bit before third  training. After that I rest a little bit and then Tia and I do  combination practice. Dinner and then bed. Was your daily routine  different when you were my age?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Arf laughed at that. “Yes, when  she was your age she woke up, trained for two hours, and then went to  school until three, trained another two hours, and ate dinner, did her  homework, spent time with her friends, and then went straight to bed  after a bath.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru gaped at her. “That's right... You didn't do boot camp or special training or anything did you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nope,”  She gave Subaru a peace sign. “I passed go and collected my two hundred  dollars!” The girl was certain Subaru had no idea what that statement  meant but Arf still found it funny enough to laugh at.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Elio, do you want anything to eat?” Lutecia pondered, looking over at him a little closer than she really needed.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um,  no thank you I'm fine...” The red head laughed nervously, moving  lightly in another direction when Caro go closer to his other side.  “I'm not really thirsty either...” He turned down the drink offer.  “Eh...hehe...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Signum shook her head as she observed them. “That boy has no idea what he's in for when he hits puberty does he?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shamal  covered her mouth. “Oh my, I didn't even think about that... I wonder  if he even knows what 'the birds and the bees' are...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I highly  doubt it,” The pink haired girl leaned back in her lawn chair by the  fire and looked up at the stars. “Peaceful night isn't it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah,  it sure is.” She looked up at the constellations for a few moments  before a semi loud yelp made her look back over at the three young  ones, where Caro was giving Elio's neck an exceedingly long kiss.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There,” The little girl exclaimed, proud of herself for leaving a small bruise on Elio's neck. “All done.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All done?” Signum asked her, making the three look over at her. “Caro, what did you just do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Gave  a sign of my affection!” She replied innocently. “Mommy told me I  should do that sometimes to let the person I like know it.” Caro  smiled, pleased with herself for remembering to do it. “Elio-kun just  told me that Kuhn-said he could officially work with him on Firesdays  if he wanted to! I'm really proud so I wanted to show him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And Nanoha...told you to do that?” Shamal asked her nervously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nuh uh,” She shook her head. “I didn't know what I should do so I watched her and Fate-san when they were together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...And Nanoha did that to Fate's neck?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Un!”  Caro nodded as she recalled it. “And then she said 'Let me show you how  much I missed you' and then did this weird thing with her hands,” To  show her point she held out both hands and squeezed them as if she was  groping something. “ And then said something about chocolate syrup but  they saw me and then took me for some ice cream when I asked about it,  so I don't really understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Signum let her head fall forward.  “I'm going to have to talk to Fate about this...” Another small gasp  made her look to Elio, who had his neck being bitten by Lutecia now.  “What in the...Is she going for blood?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We're even,” The purple haired girl told Caro as Elio rubbed the new soft spot on his neck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No fair!” Caro protested her. “That's my sign of affection!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We can share it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Well okay, we can share this one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio sighed. “Why me...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  came over to them and looked at Elio when he suddenly tried to hide his  neck. “How did you get those bruises, Elio?” Kneeling down, she tilted  his head from side to side to inspect them. “They look like...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The one on your neck,” Signum informed her. “You're teaching your children bad habits.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The red eyed girl looked at Caro and Lutecia. “Did you two bite him!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yup!” Caro replied eagerly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I did,” Lutecia added in softly, cheeks coloring. Unlike Caro she knew exactly what she had done.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  sighed. “Why can't they be children for a little while longer...?”  Letting it go, she sat next to Signum's free side. “So, Elio, Did I  hear right? Are you going to work at Mount Fuji's on your days off?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  male nodded. “I've been practicing on how to 'flair' a lot lately and  when I came to show him today he offered me a job to work whenever I  had time off. He said he would pay me with free food and drinks as much  as I wanted.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds like Kuhn...Nanoha helps him out too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mommy has a job?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  leaned forward and propped her chin up onto her hands. “Not really a  job, but more than just a few times Nanoha acts as a waitress for him  whenever the place gets too crowded. It's her way of saying thanks for  him always delivering her mail.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Signum leaned forward and nudged  Fate. “What about your job there?” Her friend blushed and looked away,  muttering something about it not being true. “Don't be so shy, it was  for a good cause. The fire department's fund raiser there really helped  when building their new station.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio's interest perked at hearing this. “Fate-san did something for a fund raiser?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah,”  Signum turned to him despite Fate's sudden pleading for her to be quiet  about it. “Fuji's offered their club for the night and all proceeds  would go to helping build another fire station where it was needed.  Fate here brought in the most money in only three and a half minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia looked impressed “What did she do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pole-dance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“SIGNUM!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pole-dance?” Caro pondered, thinking. “What's that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's  a dance kind of like the one you did a while ago on the cruise ship,”  Fate cut off her rival before she could reveal anything else. “I only  did it <em>once</em> because it would <em>help save lives</em>!” She glared hard, face burning red. “And Signum and the rest claim it's my job there now, which it <em>isn't</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You seem upset, Fate-san,” Elio looked nervous. “Is it something bad?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“NO!” Fate waved her hands, trying to save some of her dignity.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  are we talking about?” Nanoha wondered as she came over with Subaru and  handed a sleeping Arf over to Fate. “It looks like fun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We're  talking about Elio's interest in flair bar tending,” Fate informed her  before the pink haired girl could say otherwise. “It seems that's his  escape.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like your car, hmm?” Nanoha sat down around the fire as well. “Signum-san, what's your escape?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I rather enjoy playing “Go” to pass the time and get my mind off work.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I hate that game,” Nanoha gave her an apologetic grin. “How about you, Shamal-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  love to sew.” She motioned to the clothes she was wearing. “I made  these actually, along with most of Vita-chan's outfits with the help of  Hayate.” Turning her attention to the little ones, she asked them as  well. “And how about you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia answered first while Caro thought about it. “I like taking long baths.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  suppose...” Caro hadn't really thought about it before. “I really like  taking Freidliche for walks, or flying with him.” She looked up at  Nanoha. “Mommy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm... I like napping. When I'm in bed and not  thinking about anything but how nice it is to just not care about  anything else at the moment, that's the best. Well, I like simple  cuddling too; rubbing Fate's back relaxes me more than her, for some  odd reason.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't listen to her,” Fate teased. “Her escape is ice cream and cookies.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Faaaaaaate!” She pouted. “It is not, if anything besides what I said, it would be my violin.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You play the violin?” Subaru looked shocked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,”  Nanoha nodded at her. “My two best friends in the world both took  lessons since before I can remember. It was only a matter of time  before they started teaching me as well. When Fate proposed to me,  Arisa-chan and Suzuka-chan both went in together and got me a violin so  I'd have something to remember them by while I was here on Midchilda. I  started playing again and I really like it, actually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She plays  almost an hour a day, normally before we go to sleep,” Fate added in.  “She's the best at really slow ballads but she likes playing hyper fast  songs the most.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru hummed as she thought. “Oh, that's right.  Fate-san really likes music don't you? I heard Tia tell me that when  she goes to visit you at work to ask about enforcer things you always  have ear buds in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Signum chuckled at that. “Fate has always had them in wherever she goes, you just don't notice because they're wireless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Leave me alone,” Fate stuck her tongue out at her. “How about you, Subaru? What's your escape from work?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia!”  She replied without thinking. “When we're alone in our room and she  smiles at me, I'm all 'paya-paya!'...But she seems to rather enjoy  reading. No matter what she always seems to have a book or magazine in  her hands.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shamal giggled to herself. “Somehow I saw that  coming. Oh, look at the time, it's already past midnight. I should be  getting in bed.” Standing up, she helped Signum to her feet and looked  around. “It seems like most everyone else is starting to get sleepy as  well. Shall we call it a night?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,” Fate stood and shifted Arf in her arms. “Caro, Lutecia, can you take care of the fires please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What I desire,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What I ask for,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Two  loud splashing sounds came as water formed out of the air and fell onto  the smoldering flames in one feel swoop. “Let's get back to the  resident's building!” Nanoha called out to everyone before turning to  look over at Yuuno, who was carnying a sleeping Hayate in his arms.  “Whoo-whoo!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shh,” He scolded her. “You want her, Signum?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At  first the woman moved to take her from his arms but stopped when Hayate  opened one eye and looked at her, shaking her head very slightly. “I'll  pass,” She told him with an amused look. “I need to stop on the way  back with Shamal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh; we do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, we do, come now,” Signum put her hand on Shamal's back and lead her off, leaning down to whisper into her ear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How odd...” Yuuno mused, ignoring Nanoha's sudden happy look. “Oh well, off I go. Sleep well you guys.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bye!” They all chorused at the same time before grabbing what they could and carrying it back to the base.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru,” Tia called to her partner, getting her to stop and wait on her. “Did you have fun tonight?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very much, you?” Subaru smiled when her girlfriend yawned. “Do you want me to carry you back to base?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“N-no,” She shook her head, amazed at the question.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really, I don't mind doing it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru tried again, reaching out and taking her hand. “I'll carry you, Tia?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  girl blushed, suddenly realizing that it was more of a request than a  question. “...Fine. If it'll make you be quiet.” She felt herself be  hugged before having her feet swept out from under her. “...Don't tell  anyone about this okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right!”  Subaru smiled happily, letting Tia wrap her arms around her neck as they went.</span></p>
