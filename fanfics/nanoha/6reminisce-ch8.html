<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I couldn't help but smile as the church  bells rang, signaling the end of the wedding. Several people were  clapping and cheering and I couldn't be more proud than I am right  now. It had taken eight years but the day was finally here, everyone  gathered in the remote church on the countryside of Midchilda.  Everyone in our lives were here, including a few people that I had  never met before. I was sure I would be shaking a lot of hands at the  reception. By pairs of two, the people started walking back down the  isle to finish the ceremony and I caught the eyes of Subaru and Tia,  both of which looked absolutely gorgeous in their wedding gowns.  Signum, dressed in a tuxedo, took my arm and we walked down the isle  as well, leaving only the two blushing brides at the alter before  they too started walking, getting covered in rice thrown at them.  Once outside I sighed out and fanned myself to try and cool off.   Yuuno and Hayate were laughing, having gotten caught with a little  rice on themselves as well. Although I wasn't sure at first, the two  seemed to be getting along rather happily and there were rumors that  Hayate was pregnant, although I was sure I'd be the first to know if  it were true. Finally the two brides made it to the hallway and  yelled with joy, hugging each other tightly while we applauded. I was  so proud of them, more than I could ever say.</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, we have to throw the bouquets!”  Subaru realized once everyone was out of the church and gathered in  the grassy yard outside to talk and snack on things. “Everyone  gather around, we're going to throw them!” Laughing out, she  grinned at all the friends she made over the past eight years of her  life. “Ready, Tia?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ready!” The girl smiled brightly  at her and both stood next to each other before tossing their flowers  over their heads. Several girls cried out when Tia's bundle landed  somewhere in the middle of them, but Subaru's flew over their heads.  Turning around, the brides looked to see who caught them and were  surprised to see Caro looking at it with a blushing face. Across from  them, Lutecia felt something land on her head and reached up to take  it off, realizing that Subaru had just made it land on her.  “Hahahaha!” Tia laughed merrily as both girls turned to look over  at Elio.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The red head flushed instantly,  reaching back to scratch the back of his neck. A long ponytail hung  down his back now and his body had grown to a little over six feet  tall, towering the shorter girls by a clear foot. “What now,  Elio!?” Yuuno called over to him with a smirk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Its okay,” Caro closed one eye and  gave a peace sign, grabbing Elio's arm with her free hand. “My  tribe practices Polygamy!” Her hair fell behind her like a  waterfall, pulled into a single bunch by a white scrunchie and  mimicking Nanoha's old lopsided ponytail.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mine too!” Lutecia added in,  taking Elio's other arm and smiling up at him. “So we'll share  him!” Her hair was also long still, divided into three parts. The  main section fell behind her casually while her bangs each held a  purple ribbon in them, over her shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chrono shook his head. “That's going  to be one hell of a honeymoon.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha covered her laugh, also giving  her head a small shake while watching her officially adopted daughter  stand on her tip toes to kiss Elio's cheek at the same time Lutecia  did. “I swear, those three...”  Looking over the hills she took a  deep breath and started walking to the side, allowing her hair to  bellow out into the wind. A single black ribbon kept it together near  the tip, which went to her knees. “Hayate, I'm going to talk to  Fate for a little bit, I'll be back shortly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay!” Hayate waved at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Walking from around the church building  she made her way over to the well kept military grave yard behind it  and walked silently over to a polished marble head stone. The girl  knelt down slowly, being careful of her frilly pink dress, and smiled  fondly. “Hey, Fate,” She began. Her eyes read the stone out of  habit, despite knowing what it said. “Sorry I havn't come by  lately, things have been really hectic. As you could probably guess,  the wedding just ended. Subaru and Tia are officially married now,  can you believe it? Sometimes it's hard to look back and compare them  to the fumbling blushing girls we both knew, huh? Those were the  days...” A small tear came to her eyes but she wiped it away before  it could smear her makeup. “I'm still keeping my apartment clean,  you would be proud. I even put my dirty clothes in the basket and  straighten my shoes at the door... I still miss you, though I'm happy  so don't worry. Sometimes it gets hard, though, like today. This is  where I wanted to marry you at actually. Caro was going to be our  flower girl, and Elio was the ring bearer. I had my dress picked out  and everything...A shame it couldn't ever happen. But today is a  happy day, so I won't spoil it by talking about that. I have some  news for you: A new group of forward candidates are coming to section  six in a few weeks. This will be my third set so far, but none of  them will ever be as close as the first. Subaru is now working for me  directly, as a sub-instructor. Can you believe it? Haha, wow. Subaru,  the clumsy girl who was outstandingly loud and outspoken actually is  a <em>great</em> teacher. I'm amazed.  Tia? She's an enforcer now. She's in your office and has all of your  bad habits, including drinking too much coffee”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha giggled to  herself. “A real work-a-holic that one. She stayed with section six  instead of going into the air forces like she had planned, probably  because Subaru is staying here as well. Elio has come a long way  since we last talked as well. That boy grew up so strong! He's now  classified as a rare ability user because of his ability to form  magical armor. He's currently a triple A ranked mage in his standard  stance, and is S-ranked with his armor on. Speaking of,  the love  triangle has only gotten better. Caro-chan and Lutecia-chan are even  closer than we are, and both are okay with sharing Elio between them.  At first he was really against the idea but as time went on they  talked him into giving it a chance and the three have been dating for  almost two years now. Believe it or not, they're the picture perfect  couple. They argue, sure, but it's never about anything important.”  Putting a finger to her chin she thought about it. “Come to think  of it, Caro has been taking after my younger years lately. Elio's  neck has been bruised a lot lately and she's not shy about claiming  them to be from her kisses. I feel sorry for him if Lutecia is the  same way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The two Girls  have really grown up. Caro is now Triple-A and working as a wildlife  preservationist, protecting animals and the like from harm and  helping stop natural disasters from hurting the landscape. She works  out of section six and helps us with Public Safety as well. Her  fourth dragon summon is lightning fast so she can get to places even  before our best jets. Just between you and me, she can fly circles  around me blindfolded. Lutecia is an Enforcer now as well, working  under Tia. She mainly handles cases for the local police that involve  any type of mage interference. She's thinking about going into  special investigations and has spending a lot of time with Hayate  lately. Oh! Hayate! Guess what? Her and Yuuno are getting closer and  closer, I even caught them kissing! It was so cute, I wish you could  have seen it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hearing  several cheers behind her, Nanoha glanced over her shoulder before  turning back to the stone. “Sounds like they're having fun, I  better get back to it before too many people realize I'm gone. I'll  come visit again so rest well, okay?” Reaching up, she kissed two  fingers on her left hand before placing them on the stone above the  carved name. The sun reflected on the diamond ring on her hand  brightly, as if Fate was smiling at her from the heavens. “I love  you, sweetheart. I'll keep on living my life happily thanks to you,  and you'll always be in my heart.” With that being said she stood  up and walked back over to the reception area, happily waving to her  friends. '<em>There is nothing greater than the will to live  happily. I learned that from you, Fate, and I will continue to  live... For both of us. </em>'</span></p>
