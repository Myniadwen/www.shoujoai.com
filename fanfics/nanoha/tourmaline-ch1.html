<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tiana Lanster,”</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hearing my name has  never made me this nervous before. My limbs were stiff and didn’t  want to move as I commanded them. The time between my name and the  moment I started walking couldn’t have been more than a few seconds  but to me it felt like an eternity. My full formal uniform rode  uncomfortably on my body as I made my way up to Hayate. The colors  were held by Nanoha and Fate and flapped lightly in the wind as a  breeze blew by us. My throat went dry as I saluted the woman in front  of me. She turned a document around so it was facing me and held it  out. My left hand took it first, followed by my right. I allowed  myself a brief second to look at it before standing at attention and  saluting. I received a brisk salute in return so I turned on my heels  and walked back to my station. When I turned back around I saw Elio  and Caro lift formal gun-type devices and aim into the air, each  firing three times in unison with each other. The two lowered their  rifles and clipped their heels together before putting the butt of  their weapon onto the ground and saluting. With that, my promotion  ceremony was officially completed.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By:</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia let out a relieved  sigh when everyone around her dropped their strict positions and  relaxed. She had never liked official ceremonies before and always  felt like she would mess up or trip while walking and ruin the entire  thing. Fortunately this time she came out unscathed and was rather  proud of herself. The document was instantly remembered and she  brought it up in front of herself to look over it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Congratulations!”  Subaru cheered, jumping onto the girl and almost making them both  fall over. “Sergeant Tia! Wow that sounds so weird!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey; why is it  weird, I worked hard for this?” The red haired girl protested,  ignoring Subaru reading the document over her shoulder. “You need  to hurry up and be promoted as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru laughed to  herself. “I will, I will.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Congratulations.”  Nanoha greeted after folding the flags and giving them to Fate to put  away. “I’m really proud.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” Tia  smiled to herself. “I couldn’t have done it without you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You could have,”  She insisted. “Are you prepared for what will happen next?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have to be, don’t  I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why, what happens  next?” Subaru asked happily, looking over at them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tiana will be given  missions and assigned to a division best suiting her. From Sergeant,  your beginner status is removed and you are officially a soldier to  be placed.” Nanoha slowed down her speech when Subaru’s face  started to be scared.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’ll… She’ll  still be placed here right? I mean… Nanoha herself scouted us…  right?” She looked over at her friend, who was looking down at her  paper. “Tia…? Tia, say something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha walked over to  the blue haired girl and put a hand on her shoulder. “Subaru…  Tiana will be transferred tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wha… what?” She  looked over at Tia once again. “Why didn’t you say anything? Why  didn’t you tell me!?” Subaru walked over and grabbed Tia’s  shoulders. “Say something!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn’t want you  to freak out about it!” Tia snapped at her. “You would get all  worked up and act crazy!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But even still!”  Subaru’s voice cracked. “You should have told me! You can’t  just… You can’t just leave! You’re my partner!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Everyone here is  your partner,” The pigtailed girl informed her. “You’ll be just  fine. If I don’t go out and rank up, I’ll never be able to stay  at once place for long, and neither will you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I just assumed…”  Subaru looked down at her clenched fist. “I just assumed we would  all stay together as we got promoted… We’re a team, we’re  partners, and we’re friends!” Her words quickened as she went on  saying them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru.” Fate  placed her hands onto the girl’s shoulders from behind to settle  her down. “Don’t worry, everyone will be together again. It will  take a while but just because Tiana won’t be <em>here</em>, she will  still be your friend.” The blond looked over at Nanoha. “We went  through the same thing, sometimes going months without seeing each  other. Our friendship, however, never changed… No, I take that  back: it only got deeper.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan, you’re  embarrassing me…” Nanoha blushed lightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tiana looked over at  Subaru shyly, guilt written on her face. “I’m sorry I didn’t  tell you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I want to be alone  for a while,” Subaru grew a few inches as her rollerblades appeared  on her feet. “I’ll be back soon, okay?” She skated off before  anyone could say another word to her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You didn’t tell  her?” Fate pondered, looking over at the red-head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I tried…” Her  eyes closed. “I really, <em>really</em> tried…”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Tia looked up from  packing when the door to her room opened up with a small creaking  sound. Subaru stood there in the entryway looking down at her with an  expression she couldn’t quite place. “Hey,” She greeted her  softly. “Welcome back?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m back,”  Subaru replied in turn, stepping around the few boxes in the room and  kneeling on the other side of the open box. “Packing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” She placed  a few more random things into the box, pausing when she grabbed a  picture frame. Slowly she turned it over to look at the photo inside.  It was a simple picture, taken by Fate out of the blue when she found  the pair walking hand in hand while eating ice cream. “…I always  liked this picture,” Tia voiced her thoughts as she showed it to  her roommate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…That was a fun  day wasn’t it?” She smiled softly, allowing her fingertips to run  over the glass of the frame as she thought back to it. “You had ice  cream on your cheek remember?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you licked it  off,” Tia’s lips turned up slightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you hit me,”  Subaru finished, making both of them laugh a little. “…We’ve  had some good times together haven’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t say that,  we’ll have lots more too.” Ever so slowly she placed the frame  inside the box and closed it. “I’m just going away for a little  while…” Somehow she noticed that her voice had gotten a lot  softer than normal.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah…” A small  silence hung over the two girls as they stayed on the floor. Finally  after several moments Subaru looked up at her again. “Say…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Since this is your  last day, do you want to do something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Lunch? My treat?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia felt herself laugh  a little. “We all just ate, you ran off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh… I see…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia’s mood dropped  even more seeing her partner’s head droop sadly. “But hey… I  could go for some ice cream?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,” Subaru  perked up instantly, standing and offering her hand down to her.  “Let’s go then!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right!” Tia smiled  back up at her and took the hand. “But don’t get mad when I order  the most expensive thing!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey now!” Subaru  hefted her up but didn’t let go of her hand. “Be easy on me, I’m  almost broke.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your loss!” Tia  went out the door, hauling Subaru a few steps before she reclaimed  her rollerblades and rolled. “Hey, I’m not tugging you all the  way there!” The laughter following eased her spirits a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The way to the ice  cream store was made quickly, both girls laughing happily as they  swung their joined hands widely as they walked by Subaru’s  insistence. A few people commented on them as they passed but the  pair didn’t really seem to mind the attention. Subaru was too happy  to notice anything other than her friend beside herself. Tia rarely  ever held her hand, and it was an even rarer occasion that she would  be so open about her feelings. Out of military clothing the girl  seemed to act differently, allowing herself to be more open about her  happiness, a lot more forgiving and less snappy at Subaru’s  emotional outburst.  It was that girl that Subaru saw beneath the  rough military exterior; the soft side of Tia, the person who was  secretly insecure, the woman who still slept with a stuffed animal.  No one saw that side of Tiana but her, no one else knew of the smile  that she had when she let herself be free, the depth of her eyes when  they looked at each other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you want to  get?” Tia spoke, ripping Subaru from her thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever you want,  let’s share it.” She grinned at the shocked expression that was  quickly covered up. Tia didn’t say anything about it, but the  extremely faint color on her cheeks gave it all away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I want this,” Tia  pointed down at a picture of a large banana split treat. Although the  name was ‘lover’s delight’, Tia still asked the question:  “Think it’ll be enough for both of us?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure will,” the  man behind the counter confirmed before grabbing his metal spatulas  and scooping out the desired flavors.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru paid for the  frozen treat and walked with her friend over to an umbrella outside  of the shop before attacking the food. “Wonder why they only gave  us one spoon,” She mused, scooping another bite and offering it to  Tia. “Here, say ‘ahh’.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou,” Tia leaned  forward despite her protest. “I can feed myself.” She opened her  mouth and let Subaru spoon feed her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can too, but  where’s the fun in that?” She offered her the spoon and opened  her mouth “Ahhh,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You look  ridiculous,” Tia teased but still fed her. “I can’t believe  we’re doing this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, it’s kind of  neat.” Subaru replied happily.  “Fate-san and Nanoha-san do it  all the time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, but they’re  a couple. This is what couples do.” Tia opened her mouth to receive  another bite, but froze in place after realizing what she had said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-yeah…” Subaru  looked away a moment. Tia blushed lightly, looking down at the ice  cream a moment. “Here,” The words made the pig tailed girl look  back up at her grinning face. “I don’t care, say ahhh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Instead of the  requested action, Tia took it onto herself to lean forward and bite  the spoon, pulling the ice cream off with her teeth and licking her  lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh <em>wow</em>,”  Subaru gasped out. “That was sexy…” Instantly she flushed. “I-I  mean… Um, yeah…” She handed over the spoon when she realized  she couldn’t cover herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Open up,” Tia held  up the spoon. “Or it’ll all melt before we’re done.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Okay!” Subaru  smiled brightly, pleased that her friend wasn’t freaked out by her  slip. She leaned forward to take the bite but heard Tia humm happily  when she bit onto air. “Huh?” She looked at her friend, seeing  her lick some fudge from her lips. “Hey, that was my bite!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“I’m not doing  this,” Tia protested, crossing her arms.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes you are, now  come on!” Subaru grabbed Tia’s arm and pulled her along. “Get  in!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not going to  do this kiddy ride,” she protested but found herself literally be  picked up and put down into the small watercraft with thick rubber  padding on it. “Subaru!” She got a grin and found her craft  kicked so it floated out into the medium sized pool. “Hey!”  Groaning, she reached behind herself and clicked her seatbelts into  place. “Bumper boats, honestly…we’re not children…” Despite  her protest she got a small grin on her face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Haha, watch out!”  Subaru rammed her small boat against Tia’s, splashing water all  over the girl and making her gasp out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s <em>cold</em>!”  Tia proclaimed, turning her steering wheel sharply and pressing the  gas. The spray from behind her craft shot out and soaked the person  who just hit her. “Take that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why you little…  Ha!” Subaru plowed into her once again, forcing her craft to the  middle of the pool, where a fountain was spraying out water.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“H-hey!” She tried  to counter-steer but still found the water-fall like current washing  over her head. “Subaru I’m soaked!” The laughing she received  made the girl smile despite herself. “Oh it’s on now!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The two still damp  girls panted happily as they entered their cool room. The lights were  cut on and they walked over to Tia’s bed and sat down on it. After  the bumper boats Subaru had drug her along to play a game of  miniature golf as well as bungee jump from a tall tower. Afterwards  the two spent a good part of the night in an arcade playing shooting  games. Tia had even made herself a little fan club of children who  were amazed to see the girl beat a two player game by herself using  both guns. “Hehe, what a night,” Tia managed out, getting her  breath after racing down the base so they wouldn’t be caught being  out after curfew.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Subaru  agreed happily. “We have to do it again soon.” No sooner than the  words left her mouth did the room suddenly get quiet. Seconds ticked  by painfully slow as realization set in on them once again. “There’s…  not going to be a next time is there?” Subaru’s words were  soft…sad.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t say that…”  Tia closed her eyes and leaned forward. “…Don’t say that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m going to miss  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru…” Tia  took a slow breath. “We will still see each other. You never know,  I may be put on missions with you still. Nanoha-san and Fate-san said  they crossed paths a lot as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah…” Her words  didn’t sound any happier, though. “But I’m going to be here  alone now…” She looked over at her friend. “I won’t be able  to see you here…be able to talk to you like we are right now… I  won’t have you <em>here</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru!” The name  came out harsher than she had wanted, making the blue haired girl  flinch. “Stop saying that… It will be weird for a while, but  we’ll get used to it, we-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t <em>want</em> to get used to it!” Subaru’s voice broke as tears welled up in  her eyes. “I want you with me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia didn’t know how  to respond so she just looked forward again. After a moment she felt  Subaru’s hand on hers, slowly wrapping her fingers around the side.  The two stayed silent a moment more before the pig tailed girl opened  her mouth to speak again. “I’m sorry, Subaru.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll call me  right?” She changed the subject.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Every day?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a little  much,” She felt her lips turn up slightly. “But we’ll see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…I’ll think  about you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The declaration made  Tia’s cheeks turn again. ‘<em>What is this…?</em>’ she  wondered, slowly moving her vision to look at Subaru. The blue haired  girl was looking back at her, locking their eyes. ‘<em>I feel funny…  My throat is dry, my heart is beating fast… What is this feeling?</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia…” Subaru  gave her hand a gentle squeeze and leaned forward slowly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“N-no!”’ Tia took  her hand back quickly, scaring her partner. She held the offended  hand with her other, looking at the girl with a frightened  expression. “Not like this! It can’t happen like this!” She  felt her chest ache. ‘<em> I don’t want to realize it like this!</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I-I’m sorry,”  Subaru moved away from her slightly. She had long since told her  roommate that she didn’t like males in a romantic way but it never  seemed to bother her until now. “I shouldn’t have…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia swallowed. ‘<em>Why  now…?</em>’ Her eyes brimmed up quickly as she held her own hand  still. ‘<em>Why -oh god- do I have to realize this NOW!?</em>’  Slowly she allowed herself to reach out and touch Subaru’s arm with  her fingertips. The blue haired girl turned to look at her slowly,  already crying. ‘<em>My chest hurts… It hurts so bad…</em>’  Blinking back the salty water, she gave her friend a soft smile. “I’m  sorry; you can hold my hand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia…” Subaru  slowly reached up to her arm and placed her hand on top of the  redhead’s. “Thank you, Tia…” Her words were starting to  break, obviously trying to keep herself in check but not quite being  able to.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come here,” Tia  opened her arms and allowed the girl to slowly move into her embrace.  Subaru gripped her hard around the waist while the other girl  returned the hug on her shoulders. “The truth is,” She whispered  softly into her hair. “I’m going to miss you too…” Subaru  couldn’t respond, instead gasping out for air as she choked on her  tears. “Hey…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-yes?” She pulled  back enough to look up at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you want…”  Tia closed her eyes in thought a moment. “For tonight… You can  stay in my bed?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Yes.” Subaru  leaned back forward and hugged her again. “Please, I’d like that  very much…”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Tia looked at her  friends one last time as she stood in front of the gate leading to  her airplane. The final boarding call was just made over the  speakers, signaling that she could no longer delay her departure  anymore. “Well, this is it then.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Take care of  yourself,” Nanoha told her sweetly, giving her a hug. “If you  ever need anything at all, you can call me okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” Tia  nodded and gave Fate a hug when she walked up to her. “Bye,  Fate-san. Thanks for everything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll be looking  after your progress so don’t let me down okay?” The blond teased  her, trying to keep from looking sad.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.” Her  pigtails twirled as she turned her head to look at the two shorter  members of her old team. Kneeling, she gave them both a hug at the  same time. “Be good, you two. Stay out of trouble all right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes ma’am.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Standing once more, she  ruffled the hair on both of their heads before finally turning to  look at Subaru. “Hey there,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia…” Subaru  wiped her eyes as she walked forward, shaking Tia’s hand. “I’m  going to work hard here too, so be sure to climb the ranks fast so  we’ll all be together again all right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.” Tia  gave her hand a squeeze before they let go and saluted each other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Flight 382 will be  departing shortly, all passengers not on board need to do so  immediately. Thank you.” The woman’s voice on the intercom was  pleasant, a sharp contrast to the mood that hung in the air.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess that’s it  then…” Tia lifted her duffel bag. “Goodbye everyone,” She  nodded at them all once last time before slowly turning and walking  towards the gate entrance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Tia!” Subaru’s  voice was loud, making everyone turn to look at her. Quickly she ran  forward and grabbed the girl in a tight hug just as she turned  around. She tried to say something but found that her mouth wouldn’t  work the way she wanted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru…” She  gripped the girl back. “S-stop it Subaru…” Her mouth twitched  lightly as her eyes blinked rapidly. The final straw was the sight of  Subaru’s tear stained face. Tia finally broke down and let out a  gasping sob, pulling her partner closer to her and crying freely.  “D-damn it!” She cursed, trying to stop her tears. “I didn’t  want to-to cry!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay to cry  at times,” Subaru informed her before they moved to look at each  other in the embrace. “…Here,” She reached behind her head and  pulled the white bow, making the long bandana slip from her forehead.  “It’s my favorite ribbon; keep it to remember me by all right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia nodded, quickly  rubbing her sleeve over her eyes to wipe away the tears. “In that  case…” Her hands went back to her pigtails and slipped the black  silk from them. “You said you were going to grow your hair right?  These would look great on you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly the girls used  their free hands to accept the gifts and relinquished their own.  “I’ll call you, all right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia tried to smile.  “Everyday?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” Subaru  fought back another wave. “Every day, I promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll be looking  forward to it…Goodbye.” The word seemed to hurt her more than she  could show.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Goodbye is just too  sad… How about ‘see you soon?’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia nodded. “Okay…  See you soon, Subaru.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See you soon…”  Subaru gave her a final softer hug and felt her emotions rise in her  chest again when Tia’s lips kissed her cheek.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Parting slowly, Tia  gave her a smile and picked up her bag again. With her free hand she  wrapped the white ribbon around her neck a few times to make it stay  and then picked up her other bag. Turning, the silk flared out behind  her and floated gracefully behind her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The group of people  stood at the glass windows, watching the loading dock pull away from  the plane before it finally started to move. Slowly the blue haired  girl placed a hand on the glass and watched the plane take off. Her  hand gripped the holy black ribbons as she wiped her tears. “Be  safe out there, Tia…I care about you, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You okay?” Nanoha  asked softly as she came up behind her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.” Subaru  smiled, looking over her shoulder. “Because I’m going to be  strong, just like her…So that one day, we’ll be able to stay  together again. Forever.”</span></p>

A/N: A sad story. I hope it touched you in some way, I put alot of my feelings into this one.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fun Facts: The name tourmaline comes from the Singhalese  words 'tura mali'. In translation, this means something like 'stone  with mixed colours', referring to the colour spectrum of this gemstone,  which outdoes that of all other precious stones. They often have two or more colours. There are tourmalines which change  their colour when the light changes from daylight to artificial light,  and some show the light effect of a cat's eye. No two tourmalines are  exactly alike. This gemstone has an endless number of faces, and for  that reason it suits all moods. No wonder that magical powers have been  attributed to it since ancient times. In particular, it is the gemstone  of love and of friendship, and is said to render them firm and  long-lasting.</span></p>
