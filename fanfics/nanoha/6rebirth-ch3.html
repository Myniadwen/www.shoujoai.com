<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Waking up was painful  to say the least. My head felt like something on the inside was  hitting it with a hammer each time my heart beat. I groaned softly,  feeling a horrible taste in my mouth. The light almost blinded me  when I opened my eyes and forced me to bring a hand up to cover them.  ‘<em>I’m never drinking again,</em>’ my mind thought groggily as  I sat up and scratched the back of my head, realizing I only had one  pigtail left in my hair. ‘<em>Why are my legs so sore?... And why is  it so cold?</em>’ I finally managed to open my eyes and squint  through the headache inducing light. ‘<em>Why am I naked…?</em>’  Looking to the side I noticed that I wasn’t even in my own bed. A  sudden feeling of dread washed over me as I shakily moved my hand  over to the lump of covers next to me. Swallowing, I braced myself  for what was about to come. Slowly the covers were pulled back,  revealing the blue hair of an equally naked Subaru. “Oh god…”  My hand instantly went to my mouth in shock. I had slept with my best  friend…</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>TSAB  6</strong><strong>th</strong><strong> mobile division III</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By:  Satashi </strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru moaned lightly,  pushing herself up from the pillow and sitting upright. The girl let  out a large yawn, broken half way by suddenly grabbing her head. “Oh  wow, my first hang over…” She coughed slightly, looking over  towards the terrified Tia. “…G’morning,” She greeted shyly.  “Last night was amazing,” Her cheeks colored more, as if she  couldn’t believe she actually said that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia’s eyes widened  slightly when she saw the hickies on her friend’s body. Everything  that happened last night crashed on her all at once: Making out on  the elevator, scrambling to get to the door, the slow removal of  clothing, and the small gasp of her name. “I… I mean we…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?” Subaru sat  Indian style, pulling the covers up to cover her body with one hand  and using the other to try and block out some of the light.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The red head swallowed  again, mind flashing back to Subaru’s nervous request that they  should probably stop and her constant insistence that she wanted to  continue. ‘<em>We had sex…we had sex…we had SEX!</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia, what’s  wrong?” Subaru scooted over towards her, embracing the girl. “Does  you head hurt too? Want me to get you some medicine?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“N-no!” She quickly  pushed the girl away, making her fall over onto the bed. “I…I…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia…?” Subaru  looked hurt at the motion.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I…I have to go,”  she quickly got out of bed and stumbled over to her closet to find  some clothes. When that didn’t go as fast as she wanted, the girl  grabbed her device card and called forth her battle uniform to cover  herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wha…wait! Don’t  leave me alone!” Subaru gasped out, reaching for her from the bed.  “T-Tia!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia looked over her  shoulder at the scared girl calling for her. A quick memory of Subaru  laying naked underneath her came to her mind. She had just asked if  they should stop, voiced that she was nervous since it was her first  time. Tia had denied her, kissing the girl softly and whispering  words of love into her ear. Now with Subaru’s frightened eyes  looking at her Tia felt fear in her own heart. Instead of answering  her, the redhead quickly opened the door to their room and ran out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia…” Subaru  blinked quickly, trying to hold back her tears. After the first one  escaped her, she felt her defenses break and fell onto her bed,  sobbing into a pillow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia ran down the  hallway and to the elevator, pleased to find it open almost instantly  to her beckoning. The doors opened and revealed a fully dressed  Nanoha, who almost bumped into her. “Ah, good morning Tia-san.”  She noticed that she was in battle gear. “Going to train already? I  thought you would have a killer hang over from all that you drank  last night?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, um, I mean I do  but…” She looked over at her dorm room door and quickly hopped  into the elevator when Nanoha stepped out. “I’m going to train!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Want to have  breakfast first?” The girl offered happily. “I’m getting the  Lightning members and Subaru-san as well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“S-sorry, no.” Tia  reached out and pressed a button on the elevator. The ‘ding’  sound made her bring a hand back to her head in pain as she gave  Nanoha an apologetic look.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That was weird…”  Nanoha shrugged and merrily walked over to Caro’s room since it was  the first along the way and knocked on it lightly. “Caro-saaaan?  You awake yet?” No answer greeted her in return so she tried again.  “Caro-san? It’s already eight, you need to get up silly girl.”  Again nothing answered her, making her frown. “You okay in there?”  She waved her hand across the lock, using her rank to make the door  open. The lights were off but the sunlight streaming through the  closed blinds gave her enough light to see the girl curled up in bed.  She took a moment to look around as she walked over to her, pleased  that the small girl had decorated her room. Stuffed animals were  everywhere, as well as posters of random things. To her amusement she  found picture frames along the walls and desk, most of which showed  Fate and Caro together.  “Hey there,” she greeted the girl  softly, kneeling beside the bed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro opened her eyes  slowly, giving Nanoha a sad look. “…Hey…” She whispered back,  pulling the covers up to her nose. “My tummy hurts…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry,”  Nanoha pet her lightly. “I gave you my drink by accident, please  forgive me?” She got a small nod. “I know you don’t want to,  but you need to get up and eat something. You’ll feel amazingly  better in just a little bit, I promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can’t stay in  bed?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can, but you’ll  feel bad almost all day long,” She helped move the covers back and  lifted the girl up into her arms. “If you eat something it’ll  settle your stomach. Come on, I made muffins this morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay.” Caro nodded  sleepily and held onto her. “The lights are bright…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha laughed  nervously. “Ten years old and having her first hangover… Man am I  the teacher of the year or what?” She carried the girl outside into  the hallway, nearly running into Elio in the process. “Hey there,”  She greeted, dancing around him expertly so they wouldn’t collide.  “Almost ran over two people in under five minutes, I’m on a  roll.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey Aunt Nanoha,”  He saluted her. “Er, Nanoha-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Want to come to  breakfast?” She smiled when he nodded. “Could you ask Subaru-san  as well for me?</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Fate-chan, get <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">up</span></em>.”  Nanoha sighed, pulling the covers back on the  still-clothed-from-last-night girl. “They’re already downstairs  and the muffins are done so come eat.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ngghhh…” Fate  pushed her head into a pillow and groaned. “Shut up, I’m not  getting out of bed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come <em>on</em>.”  Nanoha slid her hands under the girl and hefted her into the air.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s better,”  She sat the blond down on her feet and held her when she looked like  she was about to fall over. “Change clothes and come downstairs, I  have breakfast and medicine for you already okay sweetheart?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ngh,” Fate nodded,  walking over to her dresser with one hand nursing her head. “How is  it you never get hung over?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Skill,” Nanoha  giggled before going back downstairs to her company. “Fate-chan’ll  be down in a moment, go ahead and eat your hearts out.” Her friends  nodded and began to eat slowly at first, then picking up their pace  once they realized how hungry they were. A knock at the door revealed  Subaru, who was still finger combing her hair to try and get it half  way presentable. “Hey Subaru-san,” Nanoha motioned for her to  join the rest of them. “Hungry?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Starved,” The blue  haired girl leaned against the counter since the two little ones were  sitting on the only barstools across from her. “What kind?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Blueberry today.”  Nanoha handed her a few pills and a glass of orange juice. “Here,  this’ll knock out your hangover really fast.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How did you know I  was hung over?” Subaru accepted the pills and took them quickly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your eyes are puffy  and your cheeks are red.” Nanoha looked a little closer. “Looks  like you’ve been crying?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” Subaru took a  bite of the offered treats and changed the subject. “How are you  this morning Caro?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I feel funny,” She  nibbled on her muffin slowly. “But it’s going away.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Subaru ate  in bigger bites, chugging her juice. ‘<em>I always seem to eat when  I’m stressed out…</em>’</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Tia frowned as the  targets shook one by one as they were hit by her bullets. She was in  the illusionary training ground set on forest mode, shooting red and  white bully’s eye targets as they appeared randomly around her.  Shells littered her feet, hands burning from the heat put off from  firing the rounds. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This isn’t happening,</span></em>’ Her mind  wondered as her hands went on reflex alone. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This –can’t- be  happening. I’m not gay, I don’t like girls!</span></em>’ Her body  turned, shooting several more targets as they dropped down from the  trees. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I don’t like Subaru like that, I don’t!</span></em>’  Spinning once more, she shot several times, making one target blow up  instead of just shaking. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Those eyes…</span></em>’ Her mouth frowned  more, reflecting back on the large orbs that clearly had admiration  and love in them. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I don’t want to see those eyes!</span></em>’
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia felt her skin itch,  a signal that something was wrong around her. Sure enough a pink  blast of energy landed right where she had just been standing. The  girl rolled across the ground, avoiding more blast as they collided  with the dirt. As she reclaimed her footing several different color  blast came at her from different directions. ‘<em>Okay then,</em>’  She though bitterly. ‘<em>A surprise training session, huh? Fine! I  need to work out some frustration anyway!</em>’  The practice clips  disengaged from her gun and she instantly reloaded with her real  cartridges. “Cross mirage, Let’s go all out!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All right! Reload  complete!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her feet spread along  the ground, gripping into the dirt. Eyes scanned the area and hands  blurred as bullets flew thickly around her. The girl spun around  quickly, blasting several shots that were sneaking up on her. The  attacks doubled in number, forcing her to quickly adapt and speed up  as well. Soon different color bullets were leaving her guns as well,  each tracking down their intended targets. ‘<em>I’ll get hit like  this,</em>’ she realized as she was forced to slide to the side to  avoid that scenario. ‘<em>… I wonder…</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Quickly Tia loaded  another clip into her gun and fended off the attacks with one hand,  using the new one to shoot into the air several times. The orange  bullets came back down and circled her body. Now with bullets flying  around her she went back to shooting down what was being aimed at her  again, relief washing over her as her bullet shield took out any  shots that would normally make her have to move. “You have to do  better than that, Nanoha-san!” She cried out, frantically moving  faster to blast the remaining shots out of the air.  “Ha!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia heard the high  pitched sound of a charge up attack, making her freeze in her tracks.  “Divine…!” The words reached her ear but she didn’t move.  Instead she put both barrels in front of her and charged up her own  attack. “…Buster!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Scatter shot!” Tia  let loose her own fire, shooting the large pink mass of energy flying  at her. Just as she had hoped, the blast was destroyed. A smile came  across her face for a full two seconds before she realized that the  dissipated energy formed into balls, each zipping towards her. The  red head brought her guns up to counter but each clicked, signaling  that they were out of energy. “Oh no…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re wound up,”  Nanoha finally revealed herself, flying down to the girl who was  still braced for impact. Tia slowly opened her eyes and saw that the  balls of energy were hovering in front of her, only attacking enough  to destroy her barrier. “If your mind is clouded you will make bad  mistakes on the battle field.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia panted, wiping her  mouth. “I’m just a little out of it, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anything you want to  talk about?” Nanoha stood in front of her, allowing her magic to  dissipate around them. “I’m a good listener.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Sorry, it’s  personal.” The shorter girl closed her eyes sadly. “I just need a  while to clear my head.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha observed her for  a moment, debating if the younger one was having battlefield regrets.  “All right then,” She put a hand on her head, making Tia look up  at her. “If you ever need me, I’m here for you. Personal or  Military.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” The  girls both looked to the side as someone approached them. The figure  came into view quickly, gliding along skates. “Subaru…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia!” The girl  stopped in her tracks instantly, looking over at her. “…Tia,  about last night…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing to talk  about,” The redhead turned around and allowed her guns to reform  back into a card. “Thanks for the training, Nanoha-san. I have to  be going now.” With those words, the girl ran away, not looking  back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Did something  happen…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru looked down.  “…No, nothing happened…”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“I’m home,”  Nanoha called out while trying to get the door closed and not drop  any of the groceries she had piled in her arms. “…Do I smell  cookies?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Welcome home, and  yes.” Fate called from the kitchen. “Care-san made them!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” The brown  haired girl looked amused for a moment. The young female had flour on  her face and hair, as well as cookie dough stuck to her hands.  “What’s the occasion?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-san told me  that Elio-kun carried me all last night, so I’m making him cookies  as a thank you,” Caro told her happily. “I asked Fate-san if I  could use the mess hall kitchen but she said that she would help me  in here…sorry if it’s an inconvenience?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not at all,”  Nanoha pet the girl on the head before starting to put things away.  “Do you not remember much of last night?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s kind of  fuzzy,” She admitted, arranging cookie dough on a baking sheet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha laughed  nervously when Fate gave her a nasty look. “Nya haha…sorry  again…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay, I feel  fine now,” Caro picked up the sheet and went to the oven, smiling  when Nanoha pulled the door down for her. “Now to just let them  bake.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll watch over  them for you,” Fate told her, bending over to be more eye level  with the girl. “Why don’t you go watch some TV for a little  while?” She cleaned her up as best she could with a tea towel.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, thank you.”  Caro bowed lightly before leaving the kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re so kind,”  Nanoha spoke softly so the little one wouldn’t overhear. “Always  going out of your way to make sure they have a childhood.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate blushed lightly,  looking around the corner at the pink haired girl who was happily  watching the screen. “They’re so young. I know each one has their  own reason for being here but I still want them to have fun whenever  they can… Like you allowed for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry,”  Nanoha hugged her from behind and whispered in her ear. “They’ll  grow up happy and strong, we’ll see to that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha…” Fate  embraced the hands around her stomach a moment before turning around  in the embrace and hugging her back. “You’ve always helped me  take care of Elio, and now Caro as well…Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re my kids  too,” She winked. “Elio has called me ‘aunt’ since the first  time I’ve met him after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just because he  thought you were my sister,” She teased happily at the memory.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Would you rather him  call us both ‘mommy’?” Nanoha smiled brightly at her, leaning  up to kiss her girlfriend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But that would make  you my…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, it would.”  The two kissed soundly, holding back their gasp for air so Caro  wouldn’t come to check up on them. Moments passed by quickly, the  kiss getting deeper until finally the buzzer on the oven went off  right behind them. Frightened by the sudden loud noise the girls  pulled away quickly, Nanoha bringing a hand to her mouth. “You bit  my tongue!” She accused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“S-sorry!” Fate  quickly turned off the buzzer and got some distance between her  girlfriend just in time for Caro to come back in.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are they cookies  yet?” She looked over at the girls and blinked. “Um, did I forget  to do something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, no!” Fate  opened the oven and took out the sheet. “They’re perfect, hehehe…  yeah, perfect!” She gave Nanoha an apologetic look; sure she  wouldn’t live that one down for years to come.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Alarm set, 5:30,  please wake up, my master.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha lazily sat up in  the bed, covering a yawn. “Thank you, Raising Heart…” After  rubbing her eyes she looked over to the side to see Fate pressed  against the wall hugging a pillow. “Wake up, Fate-chan.” She  crawled over the large bed to her friend and shook her lightly. “What  time did you go to sleep?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Too late,” The  blond groaned. “I went through that entire folder yesterday… Let  me sleep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can’t; today’s  Earthsday. You have to run with the forwards while I’m at my  kickboxing class. Come on, you promised.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ugggh… Have I ever  mentioned I hate you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Once or twice,”  Nanoha kissed her girlfriend’s forehead. “Now get up.” She gave  her a quick pat to the stomach and rolled out of bed. “You’ll get  out of shape if you don’t run everyday.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t want to  hear that from the girl who flies everywhere she can, despite  constantly getting scolded about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Cranky this morning  are we?” Nanoha giggled to herself. Fate had <em>never</em> been a  morning person. “I’ll make you some coffee.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” Fate  waited until Nanoha was out of sight and curled back under the  covers, closing her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Get out of bed,  Fate-chan!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can’t even see  me!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Subaru?” Nanoha  blinked at seeing her student in the gym. “Not going to run with  everyone else today?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blue haired girl  blushed lightly. “Well, um, I kind of…” She looked down to the  floor while trying to remember the excuse she had come up with. “I  heard you have a personal trainer?” Changing the subject was always  a nice way to get the focus off oneself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha nodded. “Yeah,  because I was never any good at physical things. I almost failed my  gym classes in school and when I joined the military I was so out of  shape for this kind of thing they had to get me a PT.” She smiled  lightly, embarrassed. “I couldn’t fight hand to hand at <em>all</em> so they got someone special for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see…” Subaru  bit her bottom lip, debating. “Say?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can I… I mean,  would you mind if…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You want to try it  out as well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure, I don’t  mind.” Nanoha looked around the gym a moment before spotting her  instructor. “Arnold-san!” The name was combined with a wave,  catching the man’s attention. “This is Subaru-san,” Nanoha  introduced, pointing to her student. “She wants to train too, is  that okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man known as Arnold  looked at the petite blue haired girl and rubbed his chin with one  hand. He was rather large in size, towering both of the girls by an  easy two feet. His body was tone and muscular, not to mention very  tan. “All right,” He agreed after a moment. “Get ready,” he  continued, voice heavy with an accent. “Because I am gonna pump!”  He clapped his hands once and pointed at her. “You up!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru was seriously  having second thoughts.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate looked over to the  side when Nanoha and Subaru came running up to the platform in front  of the training ground, currently set on forest mode. “Nanoha,”  She greeted them. “And Subaru-san.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello,” Nanoha  smiled at her while Subaru bent over and panted for air. “Will you  be able to join us today?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, Vita is already  inside getting to know everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Go ahead and join  them, Subaru-san,” Nanoha nodded at her. “Fate-chan, do you want  to teach the lightning members?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,” Fate nodded  as Subaru sped away on her roller blades. “I was a little worried  about them being in different ‘teams’ but it turns out that  Tia-san stayed with Caro-san last night. I guess they’re getting to  be good friends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She did?” Nanoha  looked over at the field. “…Say, Fate-chan? Have… Subaru-san  and Tia-san been acting a little strange lately?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…I haven’t  noticed anything, why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No reason,” She  shook her head. “I’m just imagining things. Come one, let’s get  this day started!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Hayate-san!”  Griffith’s voice came up on the intercom in the girl’s office.  “Chief Librarian Yuuno Scrya has requested a telecom meeting with  you.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Hayate  blinked, letting Rein fly up and over to her desk so she could see as  well. “Patch him through please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes ma’am!” The  voice clicked off and after a few moments a small three dimensional  image of Yuuno appeared on the desk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good afternoon,  Yuuno-kun,” Hayate greeted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hi, Yuuno!” Rein  added in, landing on the desk and standing in front of the man.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good afternoon,”  Yuuno replied in kind. “I’d like to make small talk but I have  some big news.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is it?” The  leader of the sixth division leaned forward, putting her chin on her  hands.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, as you know,  I’ve been using some of my time to try and find smugglers of Relics  to aid in your Division.” He got an encouraging nod to continue. “I  hacked some information from an underground source: turns out there  is supposedly going to be some sort of black market auction for a  Relic on Midchilda.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re kidding!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can’t say for  certain as of right now, but we should probably look into it. If we  can find out exactly what, when, and where we could intercept it and  possibly bring down one smuggler route.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“True…But where  should we start looking? There are countless auctions going on around  Midchilda, and if there really was a black market influence, it would  probably be high class to cover any suspicion of top dollar items…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The three crossed their  arms and thought silently for a moment. “Why don’t we get some  information from crooks themselves?” Rein finally suggested. “A  little undercover work to back-up Yuuno’s research?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Direct from the  source would be best…”Yuuno mused out as he thought. “I know!  Every big city has a street racing organization!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, they give us a  lot of problems.” Hayate sighed out. “I’m going to have to send  my unit to shut them down one day since we’re also public safety.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno grinned. “How  about we join them instead?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Well, it’s not  your movements that are slow,” Vita mused to herself after sending  Subaru grinding in the dirt. “You have a good reaction time, and  your rollerblades don’t hinder you like I thought they would.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Th-thank  you….”Subaru pushed herself up shakily. Her body was bruised in  several places, matching the multiple small cuts that littered her  flesh. ‘<em>And I though Nanoha was strict…she’s brutal!</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can you not stand?”   Vita leaned against her hammer. “You won’t improve any lying  down.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m fine!”  Subaru grunted deep in her throat, forcing herself up completely.  “Something like that won’t keep me down!” Her words made Vita  smirk. “Come on, I’m ready!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha treats you  all too nicely,” Vita voiced her thoughts aloud as she plucked her  weapon from the soil. “But I won’t be so kind. If you don’t  have experience to back up your power then you will lose against  people who are a lot weaker than yourself. Your goal right now is to  continue fighting me as long as you can. The more you can do by  yourself the less others will have to support you. That’s the goal  of our positions; we rip through anything and everything so the  others won’t be in that much danger.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma’am!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then,” Vita held  up Graf Eisen. “Graf, set personal limiters –both physically and  magically- to B-rank.” Her weapon replied in an affirmative manor,  washing over the short female with a sluggish green haze. “Tell me,  Subaru,” She started to walk forward slowly. “We are now the same  rank. I can not use any abilities that are above me, and if I did  they wouldn’t be nearly effective. I cannot speed faster than the  average B-rank mage, nor can I fly. With this, what are your chances  of besting me in battle?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I’m a little  weak but after everything I’ve been through I think I could be  classified as a B+ mage… Vita isn’t used to being so weak so she  may allow things to break through that she normally wouldn’t flinch  at…’ </em> With a grin Subaru ran her thumb across her nose.  “Sixty percent!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vita laughed openly.  “Cocky, aren’t you?” Instantly her eyes narrowed and she  pointed her battle hammer at her with one hand. “Your chances are  zero.” The words made Subaru flinch. “Come at me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hiyaa!” The girl  blurred forward, rearing back a punch and shooting out two  cartridges.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Too slow!” Vita  was already ducking down, allowing the punch to fly over her head.  The arm was grabbed and Vita shifted her stance, slinging Subaru over  her shoulder and slamming her into the ground. ‘<em>Nanoha would  stop here, but…</em>’ Continuing, the red headed girl gripped the  wrist she was holding and jerked it to the side, slinging her into a  tree. Subaru’s eyes went wide as the breath was robbed from her  with the impact. Her lungs tried to reclaim the lost air but found it  gone once again when Vita’s hammer slammed into her side, saved  only by Mach Caliber’s auto shield.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blue haired girl  coughed violently, pushing herself up onto her hands and knees. She  allowed herself three seconds to recover before putting one hand onto  the ground and flailing out her foot in a sweep kick. Her opponent  jumped over it and cut a few back hand springs to reclaim her  distance. “Accelerate!” Subaru screamed, flaring forward on her  wheels. Once again she reared back her hand. The attack missed once  more, this time being sidestepped. All of her momentum stopped at  once when she felt the tiny girl’s elbow on her chest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not done yet!”  Vita told her, gripping her shoulder and hoisting herself up into the  air before spin kicking her and robbing the trainee of her  consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru awoke slowly,  vision swimming momentarily as she tried to regain her bearings. For  some reason she felt cool and comfortable, a drastic change from the  heat of being outside. With a grunt she forced herself to sit up and  realized that she was in a hospital bed. “Ow… What hit me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Vita-chan,” Shamal  answered her, leaning over to inspect the now awake girl. “You were  out for almost three hours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My head is killing  me…” Subaru groaned, allowing the doctor to inspect her and  answered the standard questions before being allowed to get out of  the bed. “How did I even get here?” She wondered briefly,  accepting the pain killers the doctor handed her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tiana carried you,”  Shamal replied happily. “She asked me to take care of you but she  left when I was debating using smelling salts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia…”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Understand the  mission objective?” Yuuno asked Fate as she drove her car through  the night streets.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Understood,” Fate  told the screen as she continued to follow the bright green car with  the racing spoiler. The lights reflected off of it as if it had just  been waxed and washed several times over. Light flames came from the  exhaust and the engine could be heard even through the soundproofing  of the enforcer’s car. “I’m going to disable all law  enforcements now so I won’t stand out. I’ll be back late tonight  or early tomorrow morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Be safe out there,  contact me via cell phone every chance you get all right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m a big girl,  Yuuno-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell that to Nanoha,  I have to report to her after you report to me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blond giggled to  herself. “Okay. Going undercover now.” She got a nod in reply so  she reached under her steering wheel and pulled up a cover hiding a  button, which she pressed. “Okay then…Everything relating to law  enforcement is disabled and hidden…” She took a breath and revved  her engine at the stoplight next to the green car and a sharp looking  dark blue one. The light turned green and the two shot forward  instantly. Fate slammed her gas and followed them, ignoring traffic  regulations as she power slid around a turn and drifted through the  traffic to keep up with them. The two cars weaved through the traffic  hazzardly, followed closely by Fate’s pitch black machine. The  routine was carried on for almost five minutes before they finally  pulled into a parking garage and sped downwards to the bottom floor.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate looked around,  keeping a steady expression on her face. Several cars were lined up  with their hoods open to show off their engines. Music blared around  them as she drove slowly through the mass of people in search of a  spot. Seeing one, she pulled into it and got out of her car. Two  people approached her quickly while she popped the hood and walked  around to the front of her car and opened it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s a girl like  you doing with daddy’s car?” The first asked, eying her up and  down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My car,” Fate  corrected, crossing her arms and leaning a little to the side. She  wore a black miniskirt with matching black stockings and high heeled  platform shoes. Her shirt was a tight fitting tube top and her makeup  was overly done, especially the eye shadow. Fate’s fingernails were  done with a pitch black polish, complete with white specks on them to  match the dog-type collar she wore. “Won it after I smoked some  jerk-off who underestimated me. A little work and here she is,”  Fate nodded to the car, pleased to find more people coming over to  inspect it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And on the inside?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’ll cost you.”  She held up her hand and rubbed her index finger and her thumb  together in the classic ‘money’ hand motion.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s got spunk!”  One man declared, reaching into his pocket and shoving bills into her  hand. After receiving a nod he opened her driver side door and got  in. “Whoa man, this stuff is <em>tight</em>, yo!” His hands reached  around, inspecting. “Dual nos and…” He gripped her hand brake  and pulled it. “Ohhhh-ho-ho man! This thing has seen a lot of use!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So what you want  here?” A new voice came up, making Fate turn.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I want to race,”  She declared, holding her ground when the man got in her face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We don’t race for  kicks around here, princess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I only race for  pinks.” She held up a slip, making several people whistle. “You  got the balls to accept?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man looked at her a  moment longer before smirking. “All right. You’re in.” He  turned and called out above the music. “Clear the track, we’re  going!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You got some guts  challenging the King like that, miss-priss.” One of the first men  told her as she swapped places with the man inside her car. “Kiss  your ride goodbye.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate chose to ignore  him, closing her door and following the man who had paid her to  inspect. He led her to a line drawn in spray paint and stopped her  car there. Shortly after the man she challenged pulled up next to  her, glaring. Their eye contact was broken when someone walked  between their cars and stood in between them. He pointed to the man’s  side and got a confirmation before pointing over to Fate’s side as  well. The girl nodded at the person beside her car and they relayed  the message as well. “Set!” The man held out both hands. “Go!”  The hands dropped and Fate instantly hit the gas.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The female shifted  quickly, eyes glaring in front of her as she sped through the parking  garage. She felt her hands start to sweat heavily as she maneuvered  around cars and people alike, speeding around concrete pillars on her  way around the loop. Her opponent sped by her quickly, turning his  car and sliding around to easily take the almost ninety degree turn  to go up the ramp to the second floor. Following suit, Fate  downshifted and pulled her E-brake, also sliding around to ascend as  well. She felt her back end glance against the stone wall and grind  as she went up. The sparks in her rearview mirror confirmed that she  had, indeed, failed at the drift.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With a frown the girl  shifted again, speeding up and using a straight away to her advantage  by injecting nos into her system and instantly shooting ahead once  again. The parking lot section turned to loop around, making Fate’s  eyes go wide. She downshifted and over steered once again, pulling  her brake. Her car slid sideways as she turned, back end slamming  into the wall. Her opponent skidded along in front of her, almost as  if it was nothing to turn a complete one-eighty at their speeds.  Slamming her hand onto the wheel, Fate shifted down into first and  floored her gas.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The way up onto the  third floor was made easily, this time correctly sliding her car  around to speed up the ramp. Ahead of her, the so called ‘king’  was cutting another turn, easily leaving black marks in a perfect  half circle. Fate glared at the turn, over steering one way before  cutting hard and pulling her brake again, successfully looping around  one of the concrete pillars of the parking garage. The fourth floor  was a repeat and the fifth floor led them neck and neck again. ‘<em>I’m  going to hit the wall again when we cut,</em>’ she realized quickly  why the man seemed to be so confident. ‘<em>I have to get ahead but  how!?</em>’ The path came on her quickly, forcing the girl to swerve  hard. The front side of her car collided with a pillar, making her  spin around backwards. Not stopping, the girl threw her car into  reverse and floored it, using the momentum to slip around behind the  man as he turned and go up the final ramp backwards. Cutting hard,  she smiled at the shocked face of the man in front of her as she  steered her car in reverse up the ramp</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What the <em>hell</em>!?”  One of the men came up to Fate’s smoking car and looked over it.  When the two stopped on the roof. “You can’t even drift and you  challenge the best? You have some nerve lady!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A win’s a win.”  Fate declared, getting out of her car after pushing the send button  to message Yuuno to proceed with the next step on her cell phone.  “Your car is mine.” She held out her hand. “Keys and slip.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A cell phone rang  amidst the cheering and yelling, answered by one of the random people  in the crowd. “Oh man,” he gasped out. “Oh man! Yo, we got  cops! COPS!” The scream of sirens emphasized his point, making the  people on the rooftop instantly scramble. Fate jumped into her car  and started it, allowing the small screen to appear on her steering  wheel after her door closed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey Yuuno-kun,”  She greeted him happily, screaming her car down the off ramp along  with the others. “The one we want has a white car with black and  red flames on the side.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rodger that.” He  typed on a keyboard in front of him as Fate ripped onto the streets,  laughing at the blue and red lights flashing all around her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is so much  fun!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno sweated lightly.  “Do I need to remind you that you’re an officer, Fate-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure, sure,” Fate  grinned, following the white car. Several police vehicles shot by  them, forcing the two away from the rest of the crowd of scrambling  street racers. Pressed on, the two zipped through the streets,  running red lights and turning around back allies. “Okay I think  that’s enough,” Fate told her partner as she shifted and sped  past the white car. She made a motion at him and got a nod before  cutting around and speeding out ahead. “Call off the chase on us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Done and done,”  Yuuno confirmed. “Good luck, Fate-san!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks,” She  skidded her car around a turn and cut it off, soon joined by the man  behind her. She held her breath unconsciously, even if she knew that  the police wouldn’t follow her. Seconds passed by slowly before she  opened her door and got out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not bad, for a  woman.” The man called as he got out of his ride as well. “Seems  you know how to run from the police.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You could say that.”  Fate strutted over to him and sat on the hood of her car.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here,” He held out  his keys. “It’s yours. I have several more anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Keep you car, I want  something else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” He crossed  his arms. “What’s that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Money,” she  replied easily. “More than just a car can bring in, I need a job.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What kind?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Transporter.” Fate  crossed her legs and looked over at him. “I was sent from another  country over here after I was set up on a delivery. I need to get in  with the big dogs around here and start my runs again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Transporter huh?  Well you certainly drive like one.” He eyed her car. “It shows  the way you drift, you’re used to fast races where you have plenty  of room… All right then, what’s the first rule of a transporter?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Never open the  package.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good, and the  second?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Get it there on  time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And the third?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate smirked. “There  is no third rule.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…All right, since  you bailed me and are letting me keep my car I’ll hook you up.  There’s a cruise ship coming by the harbor in six days. Onboard  will be several of the richest people on Midchildra. One of the items  being sold is a crystalline energy source, a type of battery that  holds unspeakable power.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” She cut to  the point.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It will go on  auction, and Onisuka-san will place top bid on it. The ship will be  circling out in the ocean and once the auction is over and we get  back to harbor he’ll need a driver incase anyone decides to  ‘reconsider the sale’ if you know what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly.” Fate  smirked. “What ship?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The mayflower. Six  days from now, it leaves at one in the afternoon.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you.” Fate  nodded at him and slid off the car. “I’ll be there.” Sliding  in, she cranked her car and backed out, cutting on her headlights and  driving off. “Yuuno-kun,” her cell phone displayed the screen  once again. “I got the information, take him down.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rodger.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate opened the door to  her loft slowly, creeping in silently and gently closing the door  back behind herself. Her shoes were removed and she made her way to  the stairway, glancing over at the clock on the wall that read three  twenty-two in the morning. Carefully she crept up the stairs and made  her way over to her dresser to pick out something to change into. No  sooner than she opened the drawer than did the lights cut on.  Turning, she looked over at Nanoha who was rubbing her eyes. “Sorry,  I tried not to wake you.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You would have woken  me when you got in bed,” She replied easily as Fate walked over to  her. “Besides, I <em>told</em> you to wake me up when you got home. I  worry, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Everything went  according to plan.” She soothed, leaning over to kiss the girl’s  forehead. “I’ll tell you all about it tomorrow morning…what?”  She blushed lightly when Nanoha’s gaze went lower.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you <em>wearing</em>!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um,” Fate  scratched her cheek. “You have to look the part when you’re  undercover…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You look like a five  dollar hooker.” Nanoha teased her happily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh gee, thanks,  that’s <em>just</em> what I want to hear.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay,”  Nanoha pulled her down onto the bed, obviously more awake now.  “Because,” She whispered up into her ear. “I have five  dollars.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate blushed darkly  when her girlfriend started rubbing her back and stomach. “Mou, you  really <em>are</em> like a rabbit…It’s three in the morning!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nya haha! C’mere!”  She playfully growled at her lover and rolled her on the bed so she  was on top. “I always wanted to play dress up!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“So that’s the  story,” Fate finished up her report to Hayate and Rein. “We have  five days from today to prepare.” She heard the girl sigh in front  of her. “Will it be that hard to set up troops?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Impossible.” Rein  informed her. “That ship is one of the classiest reserve-only type  ships that has to be booked months in advance. The thought of putting  military on board is laughable. Their personal security is top notch  so they’ll turn down any help we offer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see…” Fate put  a hand to her chin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We could stay  undercover,” Hayate mused. “With the connections I have, I’m  sure we could talk the people into letting a few of us on board to  observe. We would have to blend in perfectly, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see…”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“The first thing  about being undercover,” Nanoha stated as she walked in front of  her students. “Is to know enough about what’s going on to hold a  five minute conversation with anyone who you come in contact with.  This, of course, means research. You will all be required to do  research on several things, more on that later.” She stopped  walking and looked at them directly. “For this mission you will  each have central roles that you will need to master. Hayate-chan and  Fate-chan will be with us as well but the more people we have to  cover ground the better. First up, this is an auction but also a  formal party for the rich; a ball if you will.” Nanoha looked down  to her necklace. “Raising Heart, if you will?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All right, my  master.” The empty training ground around them changed quickly to a  type of large elegant room with tile flooring and chandeliers hanging  from the high ceilings.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I doubt any of you  can waltz so the first step is to learn.” Nanoha looked to the  side. “My friend Yuuno-kun has agreed to help out on this mission  and has already secured himself a place as the auctioneer thanks to  his extensive knowledge on items and antiques.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hi there,” He  nodded that the group of people in front of them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Music please?”  Nanoha watched Yuuno type a few things on a floating keyboard  display, getting a soft steady song going. “Shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“With pleasure, my  lady.” Yuuno bowed to Nanoha and took her hand. His free arm went  to her waist and felt Nanoha’s rest on his shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And, one, two,  three, four,” Nanoha stepped to the beat along with the male  dancing with her. “Once you get these basic steps down you can  simply repeat them.” She had to pause as she was twirled. “You  want to blend in as much as possible so if anyone ask you to dance,  accept.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We really have to do  that?” Subaru asked nervously, watching the couple dance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s easy,” Rein  encouraged her, sitting on her shoulder. “A little practice and  you’ll be fine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now you try,”  Nanoha let go of Yuuno and looked at them. “Pair up and lets see  what you have.” She saw Elio look over at Caro and shyly reach out  his hand, even giving a little bow. The pink haired girl smiled to  herself and accepted, placing her palm on top of his.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia…?” Subaru  looked over at her friend nervously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Idiot,” Tia looked  away. “What’s the point of one of us learning to lead when we’ll  both be following at the mission?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh… I see…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here,” Fate  stepped forward and offered her hand to Tia. “I know how to lead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You do?” Tia  accepted the hand and got into position.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Someone has to be  the lead when two girls dance,” She replied easily, making Tia  blush a little when she realized that the blond had learned for  Nanoha.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess that puts  you with me,” Yuuno spoke to Subaru, making her jump lightly.  “Easy, I don’t bite.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He does so!”  Nanoha accused playfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oi!” Yuuno glared  at her, only getting a smile back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess someone like  me would only cause trouble here.” Vita voiced up to Hayate as the  couples tried to dance, failing miserably.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t say that,”  Hayate knelt down next to Vita and ruffled her hair. “You have a  role too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What part am I going  to play?” The pigtailed girl looked up at Hayate, pleased at being  rubbed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m going to be  using illusion magic to make myself look a little older. You will be  my daughter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see…”</span></p>

“Tia stop running  from me!” Subaru called out to her room mate as the lesson of that  day ended. “You’ve been avoiding me for days now; we need to talk  about this!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s nothing to  talk about,” Tia replied softly, turning to walk again. She made it  three steps before her hand was caught. “Subaru, let go!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!” She spun her  friend around and grabbed her shoulders. “Tia! It hurts! Stop  ignoring me! Please!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just let it go,”  Tia looked away and spoke softly, avoiding her eyes. “We were  drunk.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t care,”  Subaru’s eyes started to water. “Tia…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru, stop it.”  She looked at her friend’s face, accidentally meeting her eyes. ‘<em>I  don’t want to see you like this… I don’t want to feel like  this!</em>’ She tried to pull away but found herself being held  still. “Let me go, Subaru.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No…I don’t want  to.” She forced her friend into a hug. “Tia, we made love  together!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We were <em>drunk</em> Subaru!” Tia countered, trying to will herself to force the girl  away. “Stop it, please let me go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t want to,”  The girl gripped her tighter. “We hugged…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn’t know what  I was doing.” Tia felt her eyes moisten lightly. “Please let me  go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We kissed…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not gay.  Please let me go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We touched…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t like  girls. Please let me go.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I like <em>you</em>.”  Subaru’s voice started to shake.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t like you  like that. Let me go. Now.” Tia closed her eyes tightly. ‘<em>I’m  not gay, I’m not gay, I’m not gay, I’m not!</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You said you loved  me!” Subaru screamed out, gripping her harder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I lied!” Tia  finally shoved her away, turning around quickly and running. “I  don’t love you!” Tears ran down her cheeks when the sudden cry of  her name left Subaru’s lips. ‘<em>Stop it Subaru!</em>’ she  sobbed mentally as she ran. ‘<em>Why are you making me feel like  this!? I’m not ready for this! I can’t deal with these feelings!</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tiaaa…” The  single word broke softly as the girl sank to her knees sadly.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Everyone clear on  what they are going to do?” Hayate asked as the limousine drove  down the pavement towards the boat harbor. She looked over at Elio  first.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The redhead saluted her  instantly. “Yes ma’am. I am to pose as a waiter and try to find  out any information I can while serving refreshments during lunch and  eavesdrop on the floor before the auction starts while offering  drinks.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro nodded to herself  when she was looked at. “I am going to help Elio-kun during the  luncheon and if need calls for it, be a distraction. My main goal is  to try and find out who Onisuka is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Once Caro finds out  who the target is I will talk to him before or after the auction and  gain information on the items he won.” Nanoha added in. “Best  case scenario I will be able to get him alone and see it. Worst case  I will have to follow him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru swallowed  nervously. “I will be dancing with anyone who might be part of the  conspiracy and try to uncover any information about what they have  bid on, just incase there is more than one relic being sold.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I will be  observing anyone who takes or brings in an item from the auction.”  Tia finished the confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good,” Hayate  nodded at them. “We’re almost there, time to prepare yourselves.  Vita-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,” The forever  young girl closed her eyes and concentrated. Seconds ticked by and  when she re-opened them, Hayate was a little taller with waist length  hair. Mature features graced her face, showing that of a girl  approaching her mid-thirties. “There you go, Hayate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s ‘Mommy’.”  Hayate corrected her, making Vita blush darkly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay… Mommy.”  Vita’s word made Nanoha snort, covering her mouth to prevent  herself from laughing. Glaring, the small girl reached out and  stomped her foot, instantly cutting off the giggles and making her  give an apologizing glance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re here,”  Fate stated as the limo parked. “Remember, the most important thing  is to act casual and do <em>not</em> meet anyone in the eyes. You want  them to see you and forget you a few seconds later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma’am!” the door  opened from the outside and one by one the girls carefully got out of  their transportation. Fate was the first, gracefully walking on black  high heels with a tight fitting elegant black dress with a large slit  running up the side. Nanoha followed in a green dress that hugged her  curves to her waist, where it flared out dramatically. A sheer scarf  went around her back and looped around her arms to hold itself up.  Her hair was done up in a simple bun, held on place by two jewel  studded chopsticks.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru, not being able  to walk in heels, had on graceful slippers and a casual dress with  sheer coverings around her arms. Her short hair was fixed to curl,  giving her a rather cute look about her. To offset the childness of  it, sapphire earrings hung from her lobes, turning her into a girl  who border-lined being a woman.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia chose rather to  wear a Chinese style dress of Nanoha’s. The red silk clung to her  body from the neck down to her waist, where a slit in it allowed her  ample room to walk around in, as well as give any males around her a  little eye candy. Her normal pigtails were gone, allowing her hair to  flow out behind her casually.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate and Vita came  out next, wearing matching red frilly dresses that flared out with  several ribbons tied to it for fashion. Hayate’s version had black  lace added to it, giving her a more mature look than her counterpart,  who instead had a stuffed bunny in her arms. The red head’s hair  was let down as well, showing natural curls thanks to years of  braiding.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally Elio slid out  of the car, adjusting his tight collar of his black tuxedo slightly  before offering his hand to Caro, who had a simple pink dress. It  covered her shoulders completely with the rest of her arms being  graced by long silk gloves. A soft clicking came when her sandal type  shoes touched the ground, following her as she walked along with the  group towards the long stairway that allowed for boarding.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate spoke with the  men standing next to the entrance and was granted permission to board  along with her friends. Upon reaching the top the ship’s captain  took notice and went to properly greet them. “Welcome aboard,” He  cheerfully told them. “Please do make yourselves at home. We will  be gathering in the main lobby once everyone is accounted for.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you sir.”  Hayate bowed lightly towards him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You are most  welcome,” He replied in kind before looking down at Vita. “Oh  what a cutie you have there, is she your daughter?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes sir,” Hayate  looked down at her friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vita hopped forward  lightly, bending over almost in half in a bow. “It’s a pleasure  to meet you, sir!” She told him happily before lifting up and  hugging her bunny in a cute girlish way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The pleasure is all  mine little lady,” The captain laughed merrily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come on now,  Vita-chan,” Hayate motioned for her. “Let the nice man continue  along, he’s very busy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes ma’am,” Vita  instantly reached for and gripped two of Hayate’s fingers, holding  her stuffed animal with her free hand. “Will they have ice cream  here too, mommy?” She looked up at Hayate as they walked along.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll see, if  you’re a good girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yay!” Vita skipped  a few steps along before walking properly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru’s eyebrow  twitched lightly. ‘<em>That’s the same girl who knocked me out a  few days ago…scary…</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You have to play  your part completely,</em>” Nanoha spoke to her mentally as she  happily greeted the captain while introducing everyone. “<em>Or  you’ll blow everyone’s cover.</em>” Subaru nodded lightly  towards Nanoha, making the girl smile. ‘<em>Although,</em>’ The  brown haired girl thought to herself, watching Vita retreat from  them. ‘<em>Deep down, she’s enjoying the chance to act like a  child…</em>’ The thought made her smile brightly to herself. ‘<em>I’m  SO going to pet her later.</em>’</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">How is it, Caro</span></em>?”  Nanoha mentally pondered as the pink haired girl happily chatted with  one of the people standing around.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>No one has said  the name, although there is someone here who seems to be a favorite.</em>”  Caro waved to the people before fixing the tray of glasses back on  her hand and walking around, seeking out people with empty glasses.  “<em>The man to your right in the brown suit and gray hair, his name  is Oridarn. They say he will be the most successful today.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Thank you, I’ll  look into it.</em>” Nanoha walked over to the man and thanks to  Elio’s clever timing, bumped into him. “Oh excuse me sir,” She  apologized instantly. “It seems I’m not used to walking on a  ship.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh is this your  first time?” He greeted her, taking a quick glance over her body.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha smiled and  nodded at him. ‘<em>Most definitely not a gentleman is he?</em>’  she thought to herself, subconsciously wishing her dress didn’t  show as much cleavage as it did. “Are you used to these kind of  things, mister…?” She trailed off lightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oridarn, my lady.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oridarn-sama,” She  cooed at him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Smiling, the man caught  Elio’s eye and got him to come over. “A drink for my new friend  would you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right away sir!”  He replied instantly, pulling his tray down from his palm held in the  air and took a glass of champagne from it. “Here you are, Madam.”  He handed over the glass and bowed to them before continuing along  his way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My, how thoughtful,”  Nanoha motioned with her free hand, brushing against him lightly in  the process. Oridarn smiled to himself, making Nanoha inwardly smirk.  ‘<em>Weakness to flirting, huh?</em>’ She put on a large smile.  “You simply must tell me how these auctions work so I won’t make  a fool of myself?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Most certainly!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate watched the man  talking to Nanoha for a moment before the two took to the dance  floor. “<em>Tia-san, how goes your end?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Slow but steady,</em>”  Tia thought back to her. “<em>I have a good perch to observe with no  problems. A few people here are chatting to me about random things.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Good, hold your  position and let me know immediately if anything resembling a crystal  comes in or out.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Rodger.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blond looked around  the room to find Hayate and Vita talking to a few people. Vita was  using her child-like innocence to look around the room sharply in  search for anything out of place while Hayate talked to random guest.  Subaru crossed across her vision as she did a slow dance with one of  the more charming males of the night, making the blond grin at her  reactions at being forced to adapt to a dance she didn’t really  know. All in all she improvised rather well, making Fate a little  proud. “<em>Subaru-san, hang in there,</em>” She thought to the  Stars member happily. When no reply greeted her she tried again.  “<em>Subaru-san? Subaru?</em>” testingly she looked over at Caro.  “<em>Caro-san, can you hear me?”</em> The pink haired girl kept  walking past her, as if nothing happened. ‘<em>Dammit, an AMF…  There has to be gadget drones somewhere nearby…I need to check in  on Tia.</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate left the ballroom  after talking to a random waiter to inquire on where the restrooms  were. With a valid reason of not being in the main lobby, the girl  proceeded to walk down the hallways, eyes glancing around while  keeping her head forward. The way to where the items were being held  was made in peace, but upon arriving she noticed that Tia was nowhere  to be seen. She was about to turn back but a small glitter made her  look down on the floor. Slowly she knelt down and picked up the empty  cartridge shell, gripping it into her fist.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can I help you find  something, miss?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate stood up and  turned around, looking at two men standing before her. “Yes,” She  flushed. “I’m looking for the powder room?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll be more than  happy to show the way,” The other spoke, stepping forward and  ushering Fate away from where she knew they were. ‘<em>Nanoha!!</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Back in the large lobby  Nanoha felt a sudden sting in her heart, making her conversation  falter. “Excuse me,” She covered, holding a hand to her mouth.  “Champagne is a little fizzy on a ship.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Oridarn chuckled  merrily to himself, letting the slip up slide by him. “Yes, it  rather is, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-yes,” Nanoha  smiled at him. “<em>Fate-chan? Fate-chan!</em>” her telepathy got  no reply, making her hold back a frown. “I’m sorry, I do think I  need some fresh air, would you terribly mind if I take a moment?”  She pawed at his hand in a flirting way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, no, by all means  my dear. I shall be around here when you return.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” Nanoha  walked a little ways away from him. ‘<em>Ugh I suddenly want to wash  my hands,</em>’ She repressed the urge to shiver and caught Caro’s  eye, holding her glass up lightly in a silent beckoning. When the  young girl got close enough, she placed her half empty glass onto her  tray. “Thank you little lass,” She greeted. Before Caro walked  away she whispered another word. “Distraction.”  She didn’t  look to see if she had heard, but instead continued along her way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro walked instantly  up to Yuuno, who was standing next to the auction stage talking with  a few other males about fine art. “Excuse me, sir?” She spoke up  to him, catching Yuuno’s attention. “I was told to speak with you  about my number?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, that would be  Sakisaku-san here you need,” Yuuno picked up instantly. “Sir, it  seems this young lady would like to put on a performance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My, how  interesting.” He looked over her, “What would you like to be  played?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um, something…exotic  sounding, with lots of fast beats. I would like to dance, if it would  please you, sir?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno looked down at  the girl, impressed that she had picked up on ‘proper public  speaking’ so quickly. For being so young, the girl obviously had a  lot of maturity to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have just the  thing,” Sakisaku spoke after thinking a moment. “When would you  like it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In five minutes, if  you would?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Most certainly.”  Caro gave the man a curtsey before turning to track down Elio. “Girls  are so cute at that age.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl found her  partner a moment later, catching his eye and nodding to the side. The  red head instantly began walking over to her and followed her trail  past the side exit of the lobby and into a small dressing room used  for performers putting on plays on the stage. “There’s been a  problem,” She whispered quickly. “Nanoha-san left the room and  asked me to put on a distraction.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I haven’t seen  Fate lately either, nor Tia, they should have checked in… Okay,  I’ll get with Subaru-san and check things out. Hayate-san and  Vita-san can stay here with you for the auction just incase we don’t  make it back in time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,” Caro nodded  at him but grabbed the boy’s arm when he turned to leave. “Um,  before you go… can you undo my zipper? I can’t reach it…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“S-sure…” Elio  watched his partner turn around and one shaking hand went to the  small hidden zipper on her back. Slowly it came down, revealing her  bare back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“K-kya!” Caro  quickly brought her hands up to catch the dress before it fell off of  her, despite wearing another suit under it. “Thank you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re welcome…”  Elio guiltily allowed himself just one more second to look at her  before turning and leaving the room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro blushed happily to  herself when the door closed. ‘<em>I can’t think about that,</em>’  She shook her head quickly to clear it, allowing her dress to fall  off her body completely, leaving her in a bikini top complete with  shining pink scales on it that reflected light. Her bottom half was  covered by the matching bottom half to the set, although she also had  a sheer pink fabric coming from the bikini bottom that went all the  way down to her ankles. Stepping out of the dress she looked around  quickly to find what she needed, eventually coming across a long  string with several small golden cymbals on it that jingled together  when moved. Using it, she wrapped it around her stomach and tied it  off. With a testing shake of her hips, she was pleased to find a soft  jingling sound come from it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ladies and  gentlemen,” Yuuno’s voice came over the speakers of the room,  signaling to her that it was time to go. “We have a special treat  for you tonight!” He went on, catching everyone’s attention.  “From all the way across the country we have a charming little girl  who is going to share with you a cultural dance! Please welcome  Rushie!” A spotlight hit center stage, illuminating the little  gypsy. Music started to flow into the lobby, getting everyone’s  attention on the girl on stage. At first she stood still, seemingly  paralyzed by having everyone looking at her. ‘<em>Come on Caro…don’t  get stage shy…you can do this!</em>’ Yuuno gripped his fist in  anticipation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro licked her lips  lightly, lifting her head when the music picked up instantly and  began to shake her hips to the beat as well as tap her feet in a  rhythm. The sounds merged with the music, allowing her to twirl and  dance freely as she remembered the dances she used to have with her  tribe before she was exiled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru-san,” Elio  whispered to the girl, standing next to her. “We need to go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right,” She  allowed the male to leave the room first before following him. Once  outside they began to run down the decks quickly. “What went  wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know,”  he answered honestly as they made their way to where the items were  supposed to be held. “Nanoha-san and Fate-san are gone. I think  Nanoha will be back inside after she makes a round but we should get  to the bottom of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rodger.” Subaru  nodded at him before flipping over a railing and landing on the deck  below them. The girl sped along the hallways as fast as she could,  ducking into corridors or sliding around corners when crew members  would get close enough to see her. ‘<em>According to the blue  prints, the items should be through this door and into the engine  room…</em>’ She put one hand on the door and slowly turned the  knob. Bracing herself, she busted into the room and slid along the  floor when a magical blast was shot right where she had been  standing. Thinking fast, she kicked her leg up and nailed the man in  his chin, knocking him out. “Aw man, I ripped my dress,” She  pouted, looking at the tear that had just happened. Several mumbling  sounds made her look to the side, seeing Tia tied up and gagged.  “Tia!” Quickly she ran over to her and freed the girl. “Are you  okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Been better,” She  gasped out honestly when she was able to talk again. “No time; Fate  allowed herself to be brought here but they don’t think she’s one  of us. They went through that door.” She pointed to emphasize. “We  need to go the other way, some people are trying to steal the relic  before it goes on auction. Fate-san can deal with the rest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Damn it, why did  things have to get this complicated?” Subaru grimaced, pulling out  her necklace. “No one but the criminals and smugglers will be down  there, let’s suit up and split to cover more ground.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Agreed.” Tia  shifted her dress and plucked her device card from a garter belt high  on her thigh. “…What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing,” Subaru  looked away. “It’s not the time for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“… Let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Caro finished her dance  by giving a small back flip, landing in a deep bow with one arm  across her stomach and the other in the air beside her. The music  faded out and the room erupted into a loud applause for the girl.  Standing shyly, she looked out into the audience and smiled lightly.  Several people commented on the cute girl while others joked about if  she would be sold at the auction or not. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Well, distraction  complete,</span></em>’ She shyly made her way off stage and back into the  crowd. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’ll get my dress after all this is over... I guess I  need to keep everyone’s attention so no one will notice that  several guest are missing…</span></em>’
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Spectacular  performance,” A voice made Caro turn, looking up at Oridarn. “Tell  me, is Rushie your stage name?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-yes sir!” She  answered nervously, bowing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is your name  then?” He pondered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh!?” She blushed,  realizing that she couldn’t use her first name and also that she  just admitted to her last name being false one made for the stage.  “Um,” Her eyes glanced around, trying to find something to name  herself after. Finally her sight rested on Nanoha as she made her way  over to them. “Na… Takamachi.” She declared. “My name is  Takamachi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? The same name  as,” He saw Nanoha stop next to them, staring down at the girl, who  was shaking nervously, afraid she just blew their cover.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s mine,”  Nanoha covered smoothly, placing both hands onto Caro’s shoulders  from behind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, I see.”  Oridarn chuckled to himself. “Please forgive me, my lady, you look  so pretty I didn’t realize you were old enough to be a mother.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha had to force  herself from faltering. ‘<em>I was going for sister…</em>’ She  laughed nervously. ‘<em>Do I look old enough to be a mother of a ten  year old!?</em>’ Nanoha rubbed Caro’s shoulders to try and calm  herself down. “What can I say, I age well, Hehehe…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I would say, you  don’t look a day over twenty five!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro felt Nanoha’s  grip on her shoulders tighten, making her look up at her ‘mother’.  ‘<em>She’s nineteen…</em>’ She thought to herself. “Um…  Mother?” the word seemed to have trouble coming from her mouth. “Do  you mind if I get something to drink? I’m a little thirsty after  dancing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure thing  sweetheart,” Nanoha pet her head. “Be sure to come back when the  auction starts okay dear?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes ma’am.” Caro  almost saluted but stopped herself in time. “I’ll be off then,”  She bowed to the man. “Thank you for the compliment, sir.” With  that, she trotted away to re-catch the attention of those around her.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Subaru blasted down a  drone in her path and skated underneath another, ripping through its  bottom side and shorting it out. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I should be getting close,</span></em>’  she mused, rolling down the metal walkways of the insanely large  engine room. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In fact, I think this next door should be-whoa!</span></em>’  Subaru fell backwards to avoid being clotheslined by a sudden arm  appearing before her. Instantly she had to roll away to avoid a stomp  while she was on the ground. “Nice way of saying hello,” She  greeted the man, glaring.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve come to  steal the Relic haven’t you?”  He countered her, getting in a  fighting stance with magical spades coming from his knuckles. “I  won’t allow it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru frowned,  launching herself forward with a kick. The man easily caught the  ankle sailing towards him and gripped it before slinging the girl  behind himself using her own momentum against her. Subaru yelped at  the sudden change in direction and screamed out when she cracked  against a skinny pipe coming from the wall. Falling, she gripped her  side, pushing back tears in her eyes. ‘<em>Oh my god, I think it  broke one of my ribs…</em>’ She looked up in fear. ‘<em>There’s  no way I can match that kind of power…</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Pushing herself up  anyway, she narrowed her eyes, blurring around him when he charged at  her and punched. Looking back, the girl gasped at the hole in the  wall where his hand went. The man turned and dashed towards her,  punching and sending the girl reeling. Her shield shattered in front  of eyes as she ricocheted off the wall and slid along the ground,  leaving a blood smear on the floor. ‘<em>He has to be at least  double A…</em>’ her eyes teared up as she stood once more. ‘<em>I  can’t even see him move…</em>’ Turning, she set her accelerators  and retreated. One hand held her ribs while the other flailed out for  balance.  Her instincts made her duck, feeling the wind of a punch  over her head. The attack hit the wall next to her, shattering it  instantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her skates twisted  around to allow the girl to slide backwards. Subaru panted out,  looking at the man crack his knuckles. ‘<em>No good, I can’t run  like this</em>…’ With a frown she shot forward, raising her hand  to strike. The man side stepped slowly, making her eyes go wide.  ‘<em>I’ve seen this before!</em>’ Quickly Subaru brought a hand  to her chest and caught the man’s elbow before it crashed into her.  The momentum caused her body to flip upwards and twist. Her hands  went to the man’s shoulder, mind picturing Vita doing the same  thing to her earlier. With a sharp kick she buried the front wheel of  her rollerblade into the man’s temple, knocking him to the side and  into the wall. Not stopping, two shells shot out of her glove before  she roughly punched the man’s stomach, breaking the wall and  sending him through it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru panted harshly,  gripping her side that was still bleeding. ‘<em>I… I did it…</em>’  Slowly she turned and skated off down the hallway and back to the  door of the room standing out in the middle of the engine area. ‘<em>Now  to just get the relic and get the hell off this ship…</em>’ Her  weak pace stopped slowly as the sounds of crunching metal came to her  ears. Ever so slowly she turned around, breath getting faster as the  man she had just knocked down pulled himself through the hole. “No…”  She skated backwards. “No… No!” Terrified, she stumbled back  around and tried to skate faster, ribs now screaming in pain from the  sudden movements. “Stay back!” Up in front of her she saw Tia  land on top of the room she was originally supposed to be going into.  ‘<em>Tia! Help me!</em>’ She couldn’t find the words, mouth too  busy gasping for air.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia looked to the side,  seeing Subaru stumbling away from a large man chasing her. ‘<em>He  must be the main guy,</em>’ Her guns aimed at the man. ‘<em>Subaru,  are you hurt</em>?<em>’ </em>her mind hazed slightly. ‘<em>I guess  you always do need me to watch out for you…</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Tia! Tia! Tia!  Tia!</em>’ Subaru faltered her escape.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">’<em>Then why are you  making me run from you? Can’t you see that you’re putting too  much on me?</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Why hasn’t she  shot yet!? Is something wrong Tia!?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tears fell from the  girl’s eyes. ‘<em>I can’t think straight Subaru, can’t you see  that?</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>She’ll  shoot…she’ll shoot… I know she’ll shoot… Save me Tia!</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia shook her head,  gripping her pistols again. ‘<em>No, I have to focus on the here and  now! I have to…</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tiaaaaaaaaa!”  Subaru blasted forward as the man finally reached her and threw a  punch.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru!?” Tia  fired her guns, hitting the man and knocking him back several yards  onto his back. “Oh my god, Subaru!” Dropping quickly, she ran  over to her. “I…I…” Swallowing, she tried to find her words.  “Say something… Subaru say something! Anything!” Turning her  over, she gasped at the blood on her hands. “Subaru… no, no!  You’re okay! You have to be okay!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“One down…” The  man grunted, pushing himself up and wiping the blood from his chest  where he was shot. “You have more spunk than her at least. Managed  to actually hurt me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You… you… you…”  Tia stood up, guns shaking into her hands</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I killed her,” He  confirmed standing right in front of the smaller girl. “And now  I’ll kill you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia screamed, eyes  dilating to the point where there was no color left in her eyes.  Before she could even think her guns were already in front of her.  “Barrier break,” Cross Mirage stated calmly, blasting two shots  that shattered the barrier the mage had in front of him and knocking  him onto his back form the force of it. Before he could react, Tia  was already on top of him, still screaming. “Rapid fire.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The sound of magical  gunfire rang loudly through the empty engine room of the ship. Long  moments passed by as the screaming and blast continued before finally  the sounds of clicking echoed throughout.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia panted as the smoke  cleared, fingers still clicking the empty barrels of her gun. Slowly  she became aware of herself again as her adrenaline wore off. Gasping  out, she looked down at the man beneath her. All at once her stomach  twisted at the sight, forcing the girl to stumbled back and drop her  guns. Cross mirage instantly went into card form and into her pocket.  The girl, however, could only clamp a hand over her mouth before  falling to her knees and throwing up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia-san!” Elio’s  voice came to her ears, making her look blankly behind herself. The  male landed on top of the room before jumping down from it and looked  at her. “…What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t’ look,”  Tia spat sickly before crawling a few paces. Once she was farther  away from the sight that would forever haunt her, she stood up. “The  relic…get it. Subaru needs help. I’ll carry her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru-san?” Elio  looked behind himself at the girl lying in a smeared area of blood.  “…Oh no…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hurry!” Tia  screamed at him as she carefully lifted her. “She wouldn’t…”  The girl had to swallow in mid sentence. “Want us to fail this  mission because of this…”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha looked at the  man next to her as Yuuno was wrapping up yet another auction for some  sort of vase. Oridarn was getting more and more impatient as time  went by, obviously mad that his item hadn’t been up for bid yet.  “<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha</span></em>!?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl blinked.  “<em>Fate-chan</em>?” She asked mentally to the person contacting  her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Good, that was  the last of the drones.</em>” She sounded relieved. “<em>There were  two groups trying to steal the relic. I took care of one of them,  Subaru-san and Tia-san should be onto the other.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I think they  succeeded,</em>” Nanoha smiled to herself as Yuuno announced that  the last item for auction had been sold. “<em>The relic didn’t  make it to the stage, they must have it.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Great.”</em> Fate replied happily. “<em>I’m heading to the main deck now.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I’ll take care  of Onisuka here, it’s obviously him now.</em>” Nanoha watched the  man stand up and walk out of the isle of people. Quickly following,  she tailed the man until he made it outside. “Oridarn-sama? Why  didn’t we bid on anything?” She asked innocently. “I wanted to  raise your number for you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are those fools <em>doing</em>!?” He suddenly demanded, slamming his hand onto the  ship railing. “They had one job, <em>one</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sir?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry missy,”  Onisuka turned and raised a gun up to her. “But you’ve been with  me long enough, heard too much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wouldn’t do  that,” Vita stated, pointing her hammer up at the man as well. “I  would hate to get blood stains on my pretty dress.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Onisuka glared down at  the girl. “Mages…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Top rank mages,”  Vita corrected him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m afraid she’s  correct.” Nanoha quickly flashed her hand up, making the gun fly  from his hands by hitting it with a magical ball of energy. “The  game’s up, Onisuka.”  She watched the man jump backwards and try  to run, only to get knocked out by Hayate’s staff. “Well, that  was nice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s Fate,”  Vita mused, seeing the girl walk over to them in a slightly ruffled  dress. “Where are the others?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m here,” Caro  greeted them, holding her dress in her arms, along with Vita’s  stuffed rabbit. “Yuuno was just contacted by Elio, he’s going to  send a clean up crew to the engine room, there was a battle there as  well as where Fate-san was.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well then… All we  need now are my two stars members and Elio-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-saaaaaan!”  Tia cried desperately as she ran towards them with Subaru in her  arms. “She’s hurt!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“How is she?”  Nanoha asked Shamal when the girl walked out of the emergency  operating room.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Broken ribs, and her  body seems to be one giant bruise. From the looks of it she was  thrown against or hit with every inanimate object around her. Her  back was hurt pretty bad as well, and I’m afraid she’ll be  bedridden for almost a week… Even after that I won’t allow her to  train for another few days, if that soon.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So she’ll be all  right…right?” Tia asked quickly, wiping her eyes with her arm.  “Right!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, she will make a  complete recovery in time. She will be in intensive care for another  two days at most. As long as her condition doesn’t worsen she will  be fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She can worsen!?”  Tia almost screamed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia-san, calm down.”  Fate put a hand onto the shorter girl’s shoulder. “Shamal is the  best of the best. Subaru will be okay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I need a definite  answer!” She screamed at the blond, voice breaking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shamal-san,”  Nanoha asked calmly. “Can we see her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m afraid I’d  rather have her alone right now, I don’t want her to wake up and  exert any energy.” The blond apologized with her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay then,” Nanoha  motioned to the people around her. “Well then, it’s late and we  need to get some rest after today’s mission.” She motioned for  the Lightning members to follow her out, joined by Hayate and her  knights, save the doctor.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia-san,” Fate  started when Shamal went back into the room to check on Subaru. “What  are you not telling me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I…” Tia looked  down. “I hesitated… I could have shot the man coming after her  instantly, but my mind wondered…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate took a long intake  of air through her nose. “So this is your fault?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes ma’am?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate turned to look at  her. “You killed someone today didn’t you?” She knew the answer  before she asked it, Yuuno having informed her of the body close to  the item storage room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Yes ma’am.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know what  happened exactly, but the reason you took a life was because you  hesitated to save one, correct?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I… I thought she  was dead…because I didn’t help her right away… I…I…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why did you  hesitate?” Fate turned to look at her and forced the girl to look  up into her eyes as well. “Tell me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Be…Because I…”  She closed her eyes tightly. “Subaru and I… we were drunk and we  had sex with each other…and…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…And?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…And I couldn’t  deal with that, with the feelings it was giving me…So I ran from  her… When I saw her trying to get away from that man I… I don’t  know, my mind just froze. I couldn’t think because all I saw was  Subaru and my unclear feelings…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia-san.” Fate  lifted her chin up with a finger. “You will see and experience  many, many things on and off the battlefield. No matter what happens,  you must always act when you need to. If you don’t, things like  this will happen.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia glared up at her,  sniffing. “How… How can you say that so <em>calmly</em>!?” Her  voice started getting louder. “I <em>killed</em> someone tonight,  Fate! I almost lost the person I care about!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know, but getting  upset will only-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only what? Annoy  you?” Tia wiped her eyes quickly, still sniffing. “Remind you how  indifferent you’ve become!? How could someone so cold like you ever  understand what it’s like to be so scared of a relationship!? You  have a fairytale love life, you can’t even begin to imagine what  I’m going through right now!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate slapped the girl  in front of her quickly, making her stop her rambling. “Tia,” She  began, trying to keep her voice steady. “As your captain I will  guide you along the correct path and encourage you as best I can,  accepting you mistakes. How<em>ever</em>, I will not sit here and let  you belittle Nanoha and myself like that. You think you are the only  one who’s had problems!? Ha!” Fate laughed bitterly at her. “You  are the one who has no idea what it’s like, Tia. You don’t know  how it feels to be called ‘The Terror of Death’ and ‘The White  Devil’. <em>You</em> don’t know what it’s like to be talked about  behind your back. Let me ask you, Tia, I’m sure you’ve heard the  expression ‘Ace muff divers’ used to make fun of lesbian couples  haven’t you?” She got a small shocked nod while still holding her  cheek. “That term came into being because of the two young Ace  girls who just so happened to find love in each other. Yeah; us. We  have been together through good times and bad, through the taunts and  jeers and through the encouragement. We have fought and thrown things  at each other and held each other close crying. <em>You</em> are the  one who’s clueless, Tiana.” Fate glared down at her. “Look in  there, Tiana.” When the girl didn’t, Fate grabbed her and turned  her head to look at Subaru laying in the hospital bed. “You don’t  want to see this do you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“N-no,” She sobbed  out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then don’t  hesitate, Tia!” Fate turned her to once again meet her eyes,  suddenly softening. “Stop hesitating. On the battlefield, or in  your love life. It’s okay to be scared, it’s okay to be nervous.  It’s <em>okay</em>, Tia. So don’t make yourself confused.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I…I’m sorry,”  the girl choked out, sniffing again as tears fell from her eyes. “I’m  just so, so scared!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay…”  Fate opened her arms and let the girl hug her. “It’s okay…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I l-love her!” Tia  cried out softly, gripping Fate’s shirt. “I can’t do anything  without her, I’m too scared to even try!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shhh… Its okay,  let it all out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I …I…I…!”  Tia hugged her tighter.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Nanoha-san?” Caro  reached up and grabbed the girl’s shirt before she could leave her  room.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, what is it  Caro-san?” Kneeling down, she got to eye level with her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um…Well,” She  looked at her nervously. “I’m sorry.” The pink haired girl  bowed deeply. “For…For using your name today.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay, I don’t  mind.” Nanoha giggled. “Actually I’m rather happy about it.  I’ve been a little jealous of Fate, to tell the truth.” She  winked. “Elio is like a son to her, even if he is technically her  brother. I want to take care of someone too. I’m sorry if I act  that way to you, Caro-san, I know you’re a big girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It, its okay.”  Caro suddenly looked like she was about to cry. “I… never had a  mother before. Everyone at my tribe took turns taking care of  me…before…before…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know sweetheart,”  Nanoha whispered softly. “I was the one who told Fate-chan about  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When Fate-san  ‘rescued’ me from those people…It was the first time someone  ever cared for me…It felt really nice…” She looked down.  “Tonight… was the first time I ever called someone ‘mother’…  I just wanted to say…” Caro looked up at her. “I’m glad it  was you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro…-chan.”  Nanoha pulled the girl against her chest and held her. All at once  the young one started to cry, gripping her shirt. ‘<em>She probably  never allowed herself to think about it… Never knew any difference…  Now that she’s here with us, and she sees families all the time…It  must be hard on her. Even Elio had Fate-chan to take care of him for  a few years before coming here… Caro was just exiled and thrown  around like a doll until Fate brought her here last month…</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry,” Caro  finally said, sniffing. “I got your shirt all wet…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay,”  Nanoha whispered. “Say, Caro-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know how  good of one I’ll be, but if you want… you can call me ‘mother’?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro moved back just  enough to look at the older woman holding her. “…Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha smiled and  nodded down at her. “Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll…take care  of me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And…scold me if  I’m bad and hug me if I’m good?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do that anyway,  don’t I?” She laughed lightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her small hand went up  to Nanoha’s shoulders slowly before she threw herself against her  in a hug again. “…Mother?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” Nanoha held  her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can I call you mommy  too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” She nodded  again. “So any time something is troubling you, come to me all  right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Thank you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say, want to come  sleep with me tonight?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,” Caro hugged  her tighter. “Will Fate-san be there too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes she will, and  we’ll all sleep in our giant bed.” Nanoha let go of the girl and  held her hand, leading her out of her room and back into the  hallways. ‘<em>These children need as much of a home-life as they  can get, or the military will just brain wash them into killing  machines…</em>’ Her hand held onto Caro’s a little tighter,  smiling down at her. ‘<em>I won’t let that happen… not to my  little ones.</em>’</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Notes: Fate’s outbreak was hard for me to try and convey  properly. First off she isn’t really the type to just slap someone and go off.  The only way I could think to rile her up enough to do something like that  would be for someone to belittle her relationship with Nanoha. Of course we  know that Fate was abused and was saved from it by Nanoha, and in my story,  they admitted their love while one of them was dying. Of course no same-sex relationship,  especially military, would go without being frowned upon by close minded  people. So, add them all up and I think that Fate’s outburst would be in  character, at least in my story. Remember it’s an AU and different things  happened, so please keep that in mind. Following the outburst was a sentimental  version of Fate that not many get to see. I imagine her reflecting back on her  own doubts and feelings of insecurities, then using that to try and encourage  Tia to not make the same mistakes that she did. No relationship is perfect, and  Fate and Nanoha may love each other a lot, but couples always fight. It’s  pointless to think otherwise. I bet those two have had some nasty arguments  over the simplest little things, like Nanoha not picking up her dirty cloths  haha.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As for Caro, I’m sorry if you don’t like her scene at the  end. She’s ten, and already in the military after being exiled from the people  who took care of her. The girl needs a mother, and fast. Nanoha and Fate are  the only ones there for her so naturally it would be one or both of them.  Currently, I think it would be both. Her dancing? Something just for the AU I  have going here. Her ‘tribe’ and magic users and dragon summoning had to have  some sort of custom or ritual dance for special occasions. I gave Caro the  ability to dance (in this case, a type of belly dance) because A.) it seems  fitting for her background and B.) It’s gosh darn cute to have an innocent girl  shaking her hips and making people feel guilty for watching her. She’s going to  be quite a heart breaker when she grows up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate’s driving? I’m not good at cars at all, nor do I know  anything about them, so I did some research by watching “The Fast and the  Furious: Tokyo Drift” Why did I make Fate so good at driving? In the anime she  has a sweet looking car that you know isn’t issued to her by the military (look  at the military-ish cars shown in other episodes, they are all ATV camouflage  vehicals.). So every girl needs a funny quirk. Fate just likes cars in my  story.</span></p>
