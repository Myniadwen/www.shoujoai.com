It has been ten years  since we had joined the TSAB now. Back then we were young girls,  scared but determined to do the right thing. Fate, Hayate, and I were  given triple A ranks when we first started and were only required to  take a three month course before we were enlisted officially. Of  course our past records spoke for themselves. Three nine year olds  took out the Book of Darkness, the tome of the night sky, where other  specialist and high ranked mages and entire battalions failed. Fate  and I owe it to Hayate’s strong will and desire to protect people  but everyone else saw it as three legendary Aces making their arrival  on the scene. I didn’t mind it much, as all of us were given  special attention on our way though the ranks. Now we were together  again, forming our new unit to serve and protect as well as look into  lost logia cases. Although I wanted the group to be named something  nice that everyone could easily remember, we were instead given a  generic name:
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Time-Space  Administration Bureau’s Special Management, 6</strong><strong>th</strong><strong> mobile Division</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By: </strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So this is it, huh?”  Nanoha asked amazement clear in her voice. She knew that the higher  ups were stingy when it came to the formation of new divisions so she  was half-expecting a standard building for their cause. For this  reason, Chrono had officially used his rank as a captain of a ship to  request the best facilities for them. Yuuno, chief librarian of the  infinite library had submitted a report as well that he would  personally research anything they needed. Along with those two highly  influential people, the “Ace of Aces” of both the sky and ground  divisions requested special transference to the unit along with  Hayate’s four guardian knights, who were both envied and feared by  anyone who knew their names. With such high expectations and people  gathering all in one unit, the higher ups had formally accepted the  Division and held a meeting to determine the residence for them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They gave us the new  buildings and training center!?” Fate asked, shocked, as she  stepped out of the car that Hayate had been driving. Her normally  quiet voice had actually broken when she spoke. The building itself  was several stories tall and had one of the most elegant designs she  had seen around the headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It even has a  fountain out front!” Rein told them, flying out of the car and  pointing to the side, where they all saw a large stone fountain with  crystal clear water flying from it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That is the  residential section,” Hayate stepped out of the car and closed the  door with a bump from her hip. “The actual working offices are over  there.” She pointed, making the other girls turn and look at  another building. Despite being an office building, most of the sides  were glass and from an elegant architecture, there were lots of  greenery visible on the inside as well. “Because of the massive  expansion of the headquarters there was a greenery law passed,” She  informed them as they walked. “I don’t recall the exact principle  of it, but for every so many yards of cement there has to be a bush  or tree or something. I guess that’s why everything looks so  peaceful here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Waaah! We have a  lake around the training area!” Nanoha cried out excitedly from the  air. “Let’s go swimming later!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha get down  here!” Hayate called up at her, half laughing half serious. “The  staff and recruits should already be here, they’ll see you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you’re  panty-shotting everyone again!” Fate added in, making Nanoha drop  instantly. “Honestly, what is it with you and flying in dresses and  mini skirts?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re standard  issue!” She protested, face turning red. “I can’t help it!”  She looked at Fate sideways, crossing her arms. “You don’t have  to look, you know. If you want to see them you could just ask.” The  words made the blond stammer and look away, much to the delight of  the other girl. “Hehe, you’re blushing, Fate-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, okay, enough  flirting for now.” Hayate walked between them and linked both their  arms with hers. “I haven’t seen the inside since they cleaned and  moved in the furniture and plants! Come on, I’m excited.” The  three shared a laugh before Rein met up with them and they entered  the residential area. “Fate-chan, Nanoha-chan, I’ll show you to  your room so you can get settled in. Rein, have their things been  brought over yet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Should be,” Rein  brought her hands up, getting a monitor and keyboard in front of her.  After a few keystrokes she smiled and nodded. “Yes, it’s already  in their room.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re sharing a  room?” Fate asked softly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Hayate  closed her eyes and smiled. “As soon as I saw it I knew that you  two would love it so I made sure that it was issued to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can’t wait to  see it now,” Nanoha smiled happily. “I bet it’s really nice!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right this way!”  Rein cheered before flying off to lead them. The four made it to a  glass elevator and were soon riding it up to one of the top floors.  “The bottom floor is a mess hall. Since our station is on an island  connecting the newer part of the base to the older part, we’re  equipped to handle quite a few people. The first three floors above  that are standard dorm rooms, a little bland but more spacious than  what was on the Asura at least.” She turned to look at the girls,  who were both listening and looking out the glass sides of the  elevator as they moved upwards. “The fourth and fifth floors are  for the 6th divisions official ranking officers, this is  where everyone who works under us will be staying. The sixth and  seventh floors are for special people, reserved for anyone of  importance visiting the headquarters. This is also where our rooms  are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Neat,” Nanoha  mused, turning to look at Rein. “Which floor are we on?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sixth and seventh,”  She replied easily as the doors of the elevator opened and the group  stepped out. The hallway was a bright white color and well lit  through a combination of lights and skylights that let in the  sunshine from outside. “The seventh floor is kind of small and was  intended to house a group of people at once but since it was more  efficient for Hayate and her four guardians and I to share a room  rather than take up one individually, we decided to live there. Most  everything else is two floors.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here is your room.”  Hayate stood by a door and held up one hand as if to usher them in.  “After you,” She teased.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come on,” Nanoha  pulled Fate the rest of the way and waved her hand over the scanner,  getting a soft beep and being granted entrance as the door slid open.  “Oh wow!” she hopped a few steps in and looked around. The room  was a loft style, choosing rather to have fewer large rooms rather  than multiple smaller ones. The entrance went directly into a large  room that seemed to be the living room. The wall on the left came up  to a little over waist height before turning to glass and ever so  slightly slanting upwards to the ceiling. Nanoha instantly ran over  to it and placed her hands on the glass to look at the view they had  over the bright lake and the main body of central headquarters far  off in the distance. “What a great view!” Her words were  interrupted by a happy laugh in the middle of saying them, making the  other three girls smile. Nanoha hadn’t changed much at all over the  years.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate walked to the  right and ran her hand along a sensor to cut on the lights. “We  have our own kitchen?” She asked aloud, even though she was staring  right at it. The room was a long rectangular shape, half making up  the kitchen before being split apart by a bar and stepping down into  the dining room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, they were made  so you could have privacy,” Hayate told her as Nanoha noticed the  stairs leading up to their bedroom. “Since you will probably want  to eat without having to deal with your colleagues or students.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How thoughtful,”  Fate mused, stepping down the two steps into the dining room, which  had a table and chairs, as well as two barstools so they could sit  and talk to people in the kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh wow, the bed is <em>huge</em>!” Nanoha called out before the two girls heard a  flomping sound. “And it’s <em>soft</em>!” Hayate laughed openly  while Fate just simply smiled. The two walked back past the kitchen  and around the wall dividing it from the living room. From there they  walked down the large room by the equally long table and over to a  small stairway that lead them up to the bedroom, which had no walls  but was raised from the rest of the room for privacy. Fate noticed  absently that the ceiling to the kitchen and dining room was actually  the floor of the bedroom as well. Nanoha was currently laid on the  bed face down, body spread out in a giant ‘X’ shape. “Look  Fate-chan, I don’t even reach the other side.” She stretched out  to emphasize her point. The bed had several pillows on it already,  some white while others were white with pink stripes on them. The bed  sheets themselves were a clean, crisp white offset by a large pink  comforter. It was also apparently big enough to not only fit Fate and  Nanoha together but Hayate could also sleep there as well and the  three would never touch. “Aahhhh,” Nanoha sighed out and got  comfortable. “I could go to sleep right now…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You will have plenty  of time to do that later,” Rein told her, landing on Nanoha’s  head and getting her to look up. “You still haven’t seen the rest  yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, okay.” She  pulled herself up and slid off the bed, heading downstairs to look  around at what she missed the first time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Look here, too,”  Hayate asked Fate, walking around the bed and over a little more to  another smaller glass wall that actually turned out to be a balcony.  The two walked outside into the warm sun and looked around. “It’s  a little added feature they put in since the roof is shaped odd,”  She admitted. “It’s a small balcony but there’s nothing above  you and it’s hidden from everywhere else.” She pointed up along  the slanted roof surrounding the balcony on two sides. “My room is  up there.” The only side of the balcony with a view showed the  water that surrounded the small island and not much else. “It seems  a little weird, but that’s where the sun sets, so I think it’s a  nice place to come when you want to be alone… Or drink a little  champagne.” She looked over at Fate playfully, making her blush and  look away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I-I don’t have  anyone to drink with,” She stammered, embarrassed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure, sure.”  Hayate teased her, pushing the girl playfully back inside where  Nanoha was currently setting the temperature controls.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan, you like  it cool don’t you?” She pondered, pressing the transparent  buttons in front of her. “I better set it a few degrees cooler  since the sun coming in will probably warm up the living room…Oh!”  She looked up at them leaning on the railing that overlooked the  living room. “Did you see the shower!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shower?” Fate  pondered, looking around and noticing another door that she had  missed when walking out to the balcony. The black glass tinted door  opened to her command and inside was a large bathroom, everything  having a dark marble surface it seemed. “Oh wow, it’s huge.”  Fate walked in and over to the shower section, looking around more.  Several faucets were on the walls and ceiling, as well as a  temperature control setting panel and radio.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The best part is  this,” Hayate smiled, pressing a few buttons and making a  semi-transparent vision of the bottom of a waterfall appear around  them. Where Fate was standing would be where the water would spray  and around her was a jungle-ish type of place with flowers and  tropical looking plants. “The top of the line in leisure,  guaranteed to take your mind of your troubles, if only for a few  minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“People have way too  much free time,” Fate mused happily, turning off the settings  before Hayate decided to get playful and drench her in water.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah! Speaking of free  time, I don’t really have any!” Hayate brought a hand to her  mouth. “I should have just dropped you off, I’m going to be  late!” The girl trotted out of the room and down the stairs,  meeting up with Rein and Nanoha. “Feel free to look around, we  won’t have to meet up to see the staff and recruits for another few  hours but I need to do some stuff over in the office building! I’ll  show you your desk later!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, have fun,  Hayate-chan, Rein-chan!” Nanoha waved at them as they sped out of  the doorway. “Must be tough being the one in charge of everything.”  She turned to smile at Fate. “I am nervous enough with teaching the  forward cadets.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll be fine,”  Fate smiled, watching Nanoha walk across the floor downstairs and  start climbing up to her and sitting on the bed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, but the people  I train will be your colleagues in battle so I kind of have a habit  of getting too into it, nyahaha.” She closed her eyes as she  laughed nervously. “Oh yeah, we should start now!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Start?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Our new photo  album!” Nanoha held up her fingers in front of her to make a box.  “Camera activate,” She commanded, getting a yellow transparent  rectangle in front of her. Once it was formed, she moved her fingers  out so the view covered Fate’s upper body. “The first time in our  new apartment, Fate T, Harlaown looks out over the bedroom balcony.  Camera snap!” The vocal order made the yellowish image of Fate  freeze for a moment before losing it’s tint and revealing a  holographic picture. “Save, please. Place in photo album: 6th  mobile division.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You and your habit  of taking pictures,” Fate teased but despite her words also took a  photo of Nanoha as well and stored it. “You’re almost as bad as  me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m no where near  as bad as you,” She protested good naturedly. “You have more  pictures than the rest of us combined.” Stretching out, Nanoha  yawned. “I’m beat. I was so excited last night I didn’t sleep  at all.” The girl started to unbutton her uniform jacket. “Take a  nap with me, Fate-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not even noon  yet and you want to take a nap?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh come on, I was  really, really busy the last few days!” She eyed Fate, wondering on  her to get her cuddle toy to lay down with her. “Ne, Fate-chan,  come here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is it?” Fate  walked over to her and sat on the bed, watching Nanoha get behind her  and undo the black ribbon in her hair. “Nanoha-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your ribbon was  about to fall out,” She lied happily, finger combing her hair.  “I’ll fix it for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, please do.”  Fate closed her eyes and let her friend do what she asked to do.  After a few moments she pondered why it was taking so long but found  a third of her hair be placed over her shoulder and felt Nanoha run a  finger down her hair to divide what was left of it. “Are you  braiding my hair?” She pondered aloud.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I am,” She replied  simply, taking her time to slowly make sure the hair was divided  right. The process could have been done in less than three minutes  but at that point Nanoha was only just starting to wrap the strands  together to form the braid, carefully taking her time to make sure it  was snug and wouldn’t come undone even if Fate gave a demonstration  that day. When she reached the end, she left a little hair left to  make a cute little ponytail before she pulled her own ribbon from her  hair and tied it snugly. Now with her friend taken care of, she tied  the black ribbon around the ponytail holder in her off-set ponytail  and then placed her hands on Fate’s shoulders, rubbing them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmmmnnn…” The  sound escaped Fate drowsily, making Nanoha grin. She knew her friend  couldn’t have her hair messed with without becoming sleepy, and her  back was even more sensitive than that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re tense,”  Nanoha cooed out, reaching around her to undo the buttons on the  jacket and slip it off of Fate. She carefully folded it and placed it  on the nightstand on top of her own.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No I’m not,”  Fate disagreed, moving to stand up but was pulled back down.  “Nanohaaa…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” She asked  innocently, rubbing her back gently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know what you’re  doing,” She accused, getting drowsier by the moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Nanoha ran  her palm up Fate’s spine, making her bend over forward. Taking the  chance, she pulled out the tucked in white button up shirt and slid  her hands under it, touching her skin and massaging. The blonde’s  protest were cut off then as she gave into her friend and allowed her  to continue rubbing a few more minutes before finally wrapping her  arms around her waist, still under the shirt, and leaning over so  they were lying on the bed together. Now content with Fate cuddled up  against her, Nanoha closed her eyes and felt Fate’s hand be placed  on top of hers. She rubbed her thumb across her hand soothingly,  keeping the now drowsy girl in the state where she would go to sleep.  “Raging heart?” Nanoha whispered softly against Fate’s hair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  my master?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wake us in an hour  please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All  right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha sighed out  contently as the requested hour slowly ticked by the two as they lay  in bed. Fate was knocked clean out after the backrub, peacefully  snoring into one of the giant pillows. Nanoha took advantage of the  situation and held onto her, gently nuzzling her from against her  back, trying to mold their bodies together. The motion worked like it  always did and Fate mumbled in her sleep about being held a little  closer. The brown haired girl hazily attempted to do such a thing but  already started drifting off on her own. Seemingly no time later  after her eyes closed than did Raging Heart speak up again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“One  hour has passed, my master,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate opened her eyes  lightly, hearing Nanoha request another ten minutes to sleep and  Raging heart trying to deny her by getting the girl to wake up right  now. Slowly her mind wondered where she was and why she was in bed  when the sun was obviously already in the sky. Her eyes closed again,  tempted to let the scenario slide by her due to her sleepiness but  when Nanoha’s hands shifted lightly under her shirt she opened them  again and blinked a few times. “Ah….? Ah!” Fate sat up quickly,  almost taking the girl cuddling her up as well. “You did it again  didn’t you!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did what?” Nanoha  asked innocently up at her with a smile. When Fate crossed her arms  at her, she let out her classic nervous laugh. “Nyahaha…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t ‘nyahaha’  me, Nanoha-chan.” She pouted. “Mou, I wanted to look around the  buildings before we had to get to work.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We still have time,”  Nanoha sat up and stretched out contently. “Thanks for sleeping  with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You always do that,”  She complained again as she moved her feet off the bed and rubbed her  eyes. “Rub my back and then jump me once I start not thinking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not always,  sometimes I just have to braid your hair before you fall over on your  own.” The sentence was meant to defend herself, making Fate look at  her half-amused and half-miffed at the same time. “I’m sorry,  Fate-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With a sigh, Fate  nodded and allowed the girl to crawl over to her and wrap her arms in  a hug, nuzzling her cheek much like a kitten would. “Stop that,  you.” She protested, laughing. Nanoha only continued, even letting  out a small meow to make Fate smile again. The sound worked and Fate  brought her hand up to rub the top of Nanoha’s head. “There,  there, good kitty,” The brown haired girl went to rub her face  against Fate’ once more but her hand slipped off the side of the  bed and she ended up falling off, landing with a small thud on the  floor. A whole two seconds went by before Nanoha realized what had  happened, making the blond collapse into a helpless fit of laughter.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“These rooms are kind  of nice,” Nanoha mused, peeking into one of the empty dorm rooms.  She was already changed into her new uniform, a matching brown dress  suit and mini skirt complete with gold rank medals on the right  sleeve and off-setting white stockings.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate looked over her  shoulder in the room and hummed to herself. “Yeah, not too shabby.  I wouldn’t mind having had to stay in one of these.” She too was  in her new uniform, matching Nanoha exactly except for the black  pantyhose she had chosen for herself. The two nodded at each other  and walked to the end of the hall and looked both ways to see if  there was anything else of interest before returning to the elevator  and going down to the second floor and looking around once more at  the standard rooms, which seemed to be standard military attire; two  beds to a room, a sink, small refrigerator, and precious little else.  “Its times like this that makes me glad we were always given  special privileges,” She thought aloud while Nanoha frowned at the  room. “We were always allowed to stay on Earth and teleport in to  the Asura after school when we would have been in these rooms.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You said it,”  Nanoha pulled Fate along the way back to the elevator and they both  continued down to the bottom floor where a few people were starting  to walk around. “The mess hall officially opened today didn’t  it?” Nanoha asked as she looked around. Fate gave her a confirming  hum in answer and heard her friend’s stomach growl at her in  response. “I, um, could really use a snack.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you hadn’t  bedded me we would have time to eat a proper lunch,” Fate told her  playfully as they walked over to a small vending machine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You make it sound so  nasty,” Nanoha teased back, pressing her finger on the number  corresponding to what she wanted. The machine beeped at her and  dropped a box of Midchildra’s version of pocky, automatically  taking the amount from Nanoha’s bank account. “Want something; my  treat?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate leaned over her  friend’s shoulder and pondered the choices, finally picking out a  candy bar that lavished in chocolate. Her hand lightly picked up  Nanoha’s and moved it to the button, pressing her finger against  it, getting a beep and dropping it. “Thank you,” she whispered  into her ear, making the girl shiver unconsciously. On the way back,  she gave Nanoha’s ear a light nip causing the girl to jump and drop  her box of candy. Fate smiled to herself while Nanoha knelt down to  pick up the box and trotted a few steps to catch back up with her  when she started to walk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Seems like things  are picking up now,” Nanoha thought aloud, looking at the sudden  outbreak of people walking around the outside. Several cars rolled by  and people were accumulating on a semi-large scale around the  grounds. “I guess that’s to be expected since we’re kind of an  island connecting two bases, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And we’re not the  only ones who will use the building; we just have the top floors for  now. Soon it’ll be filled, a little over half will be ours and the  rest will probably wind up being research space. I guess a lot of  people will be rolling through this intersection after all.” Fate  looked at the entrance to the office building and smiled when the  cool air inside greeted her. Almost instantly Nanoha’s fingers  found hers and interlaced them together, giving a loving squeeze. “I  missed that,” She admitted as they looked around together, neither  knowing exactly where they were supposed to be going. “It’s been  a while since we were stationed together huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Too long,” Nanoha  agreed, rubbing her thumb across Fate’s palm. “But for now on  we’ll be together again.” She smiled at her and received a blush.  Together the two made their way around and finally found the  reception desk, where the girl sitting there seemed to be frantically  trying to organize. “Excuse me,” Nanoha greeted, getting a prompt  salute. “We’re looking for Yagami Hayate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry; she’s  busy at the moment.” The lady addressed them apologetically. “If  you come back after today’s ceremony I can schedule you an  appointment?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate smiled down at her  kindly. “I’m Lieutenant Fate T. Harlaown and this is Flight  Lieutenant Takamachi Nanoha, we’re going to be in the ceremony and  need to speak with Hayate please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma’am!” The girl  stood at attention and saluted them properly. “Please forgive me; I  didn’t know who you were!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha giggled and  saluted her back while Fate simply smiled. “Could you tell us where  to find her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma’am, Top floor,  second room on the right, ma’am!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At ease,” Nanoha  teased the secretary. “We’ll be seeing each other a lot so you  have permission to speak freely.” The girl looked visibly relieved  when they didn’t seem upset at her lack of proper respect for their  ranks. “We’ll be on our way, do your best today.” She waved at  the girl as the two walked on their path to the elevator. Once inside  Nanoha opened the side pouch on her uniform and took out a stick of  pocky, nibbling it as they ascended.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No wonder everyone  likes you,” Fate leaned against the wall of the elevator and looked  over at her. “You really are kind to everyone still.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That bad?” Nanoha  blinked, sucking the last piece of the treat into her mouth and going  for another one.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not at all,” The  reply was lined with a pleased sound. “I’m happy you’re still  the same even after all these years.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou, you make it  sound like we didn’t keep in touch!” Nanoha flailed her arms out.  “We talked every night! Sometimes twice!” Her face turned to a  look of teasing. “And don’t forget those ‘special’ nights.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate instantly colored.  “Na-Nanoha-chan! Don’t say that kind of thing!” She looked to  the side. “It’s embarrassing…”  She heard her friend giggle a  moment before lightly yelping. “What did you do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bit my finger,”  The brown haired girl laughed. “Tried to eat too fast.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here, let me.”  Fate took the offended hand and took it between both of hers before  bringing it to her lips and lightly kissing the fingertip. “There,  all better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I bit my lip too,”  Nanoha cooed, taking a step closer to her and looking up at the  taller woman with a cute expression. “Kiss me there too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-chan…”  Fate blushed a little but when the shorter girl didn’t retreat she  leaned over slightly. The doors opened at that moment, making them  both pull apart and allowing someone to step into the elevator as  well. “I-I didn’t see anything in your eye,” She stammered out  as best as she could to hide her embarrassment. Luckily for her  Nanoha went along with it by gently rubbing her eye.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you, it must  just be an spec of dirt or something.” She smiled brightly at the  person who just entered and got a salute. “Hello,” She saluted  back even though she didn’t have to. The doors to the top floor  opened and the two girls stepped out. The walk was short and the door  to Hayate’s office opened easily after a knock and a bid to enter.  “Hayate-chan!” Nanoha greeted instantly, looking around the room  in awe. “Oh wow you’re office is so big!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Welcome!” Hayate  smiled at them, walking over to the girls and looking at their  uniforms. “You girls look great!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you, I like  them,” Fate smiled, looking down at her outfit. “It’s been a  while since we all wore the same thing, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah it has,”  Hayate agreed, letting Rein sit on her shoulder. “I was expecting  you two a little earlier so I already have my work taken care of  before the ceremony. Would you two like a small tour?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah!” Nanoha  nodded happily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh you seem to be in  a chipper mood, did you take a nap earlier?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s why we’re  a little late,” Fate agreed for her friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? You took a nap  too, that’s rare.” Fate looked away and blushed, making Hayate  let out a knowing giggle. “Nanoha made you didn’t she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Slightly,” The  blue eyed girl agreed. Any farther comments were currently put on  hold when another knock greeted them. Upon hearing the person’s  information, the three girls went downstairs to greet the cadets who  had apparently just gathered together for the ceremony to document  the official opening of the 6th mobile division.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“What a day,” Fate  said to herself as she entered her apartment that night. The lights  were all on and Nanoha was currently on the couch with several shells  around her. “Signum and I borrowed your training field after your  students were done,” She slowly started taking off her uniform  jacket. “They stayed to watch, I think we scared them.” Fate  stretched out gingerly, wincing. “How did your day go after we  split up?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Spectacular,”  Nanoha replied with a smile evident in her voice. “All my students  are exceptional. They have so much growth potential.” She looked  over at her room mate and giggled. “Elio too, he really surprised  me. Did you teach him Sonic Move?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He learned it on his  own by watching,” Fate replied, sitting down next to her and  looking at all the shells. “You’re making cartridges?” She  picked up the small bullet shaped item and turned it over in her  hands. “These are short barrel shells, what for?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My students use the  cartridge system but they can only use this type of ammunition for  now. Although at their level they can make the ammo themselves,  they’re way too tired right now.” She closed her eyes and  concentrated, easily filling up the short shell before placing it in  a box. “I made you some as well,” Nanoha picked up two magnum  reload sets and handed them to Fate. “I figured you’d be too  tired to mess with them tonight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” Fate  took the two sets of six bullets and observed them. “Wow you packed  them full didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s a little  draining but if we can use one shell instead of two in a battle,  it’ll come in handy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“S+ magic huh?”  Fate let the idea run over her mind. “Why don’t we take the exam  for classification?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m happy where I  am,” Nanoha replied, finally finishing the last shell and closing  the box. “I’ll take it once I’m sure I’ll pass it with flying  colors. No need to tire myself out when an emergency may come up at  any moment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good idea.” Fate  looked over at her and smiled. “You’re sweating.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” She moved her  hand across her forehead. “You’re right. I guess I tired myself  out.” Moving to stand up, Nanoha wobbled a little bit. Fate leapt  to her feet to ensure her friend didn’t fall over. “Thank you,”  Nanoha leaned against her contently. “I made too many at one time,  I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The red eyed girl  looked down at the table and for the first time noticed several boxes  on the floor as well, each holding twelve rounds. “Nanoha! That  kind of thing will tire anyone out! Never mind the ones you did for  me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll be fine after  I sleep,” she countered, rubbing against her neck. “Fate-chan is  sweating too.” Her head shifted so she was looking up at her. “Time  to shower, I suppose?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,” Fate  agreed, lifting Nanoha up and into her arms to carry her. Her friend  let out a happy sound allowed herself to be carried upstairs to the  bedroom. “Don’t get used to being carried though. Did you lose a  few pounds?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nyahaha, I’ve  missed a few meals lately due to all the work.” Nanoha grinned  sheepishly up at her friend. “But don’t worry; I’ve been taking  vitamins to count for it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not good,  you need to eat. You’ll get sick otherwise.” Fate set the girl  down on her feet inside the bathroom. “You take a shower first,  I’ll start putting some of our things up around the apartment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No way, we haven’t  been together in almost a month, let’s shower together!” Nanoha  took Fate’s hand to keep her from walking out of the room. “I  don’t want to shower alone, it’s not fun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate,” The word  made the blond look at her friend, who was giving her a soft gaze.  “Let’s do it together, Fate.” The two almost never referred to  each other without the ever present honorific, first used because  they were children then later kept as a way to remember the fun times  they always had together. The only times it wasn’t used were on the  battlefield when one of them was scared or when…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate blushed darkly but  still went to undo the buttons on her white shirt. The motion made  her friend smile and she too started to undress after turning on the  water and setting it to a temperature that she liked. The girl paused  a moment, looking at the other buttons and testingly pressed one,  making the illusion appear around them as if they were bathing under  a waterfall. “Oh wow!” She cried out, amazed. “That’s so  cool!” Nanoha quickly stripped down and walked into the shower  section, getting sprayed from the ceiling and two sides of the walls.  “Fate-chan, Fate-chan, look!” She posed in a way so one of the  giant leaves would cover her breast. “I’m the girl in shower  commercials that always has something covenant covering her boobs!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate couldn’t help  but laugh at her friend who had completely forgotten to take her hair  form her ponytail. Upon realizing this, Nanoha went to take out the  ribbon and then slowly try and get the tight ponytail holder out of  her wet hair. She winced a few times trying to get the job done while  Fate finished undressing, placing her cloths neatly in the clothes  basket and picking up Nanoha’s carelessly discarded cloths on the  floor and also putting them up as well. “Owie,” Nanoha whimpered  from the shower, using the cute word just because. “I’m five  hairs lighter.” She rubbed her scalp gently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And thus the best  flying Ace known to the TSAB gets defeated by a simple hair band.”  Fate stepped into the illusion and looked around. “I guess this  kind of thing would be nice after the repetitive scenery of a  military base, though I’d understand it more to be on a ship rather  than a planet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh hush and enjoy  it.” Nanoha hugged her from behind, pressing her chest up against  Fate’s back. “Let me wash your back?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“With your breast?”  Fate teased her, looking over her shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you want,”  Nanoha teased back, getting that soft look in her eyes again. She let  go of her friend and allowed her to take a single step away, out of  the spray of water and moved her wet hair over her shoulder. “Sit,”  She commanded lightly, guiding the girl downwards. “Um…do we even  have anything to wash with yet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate brought a hand up  to her mouth to cover a giggle. “Nanoha you’re too much.” She  turned and pointed “Right there, on top of the…Palm…leaf…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh you’re right,”  Nanoha leaned over and picked up the bottle of body wash. “Isn’t  this the neatest?” She put a little bit on a lufa and lathered it  up into a sudsy mass.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, it is kind of  neat.” Fate reached out and touched the wall, making the illusion  ripple around her finger tips. “I’m facing the wall but it seems  like I have all the space I need.” She felt Nanoha’s body press  up against hers again, only this time covered in soap. Her body went  stiff a moment while Nanoha reached around her in a loose hug,  rubbing her breast up against her back. “Na-Nanoha-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmmm.?” She paused  a moment. “No?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A-ah, I don’t  mind,” She blushed darker, placing her face into both her hands to  hide her blush. She heard her friend giggle lightly before once again  their skin made contact. Fate closed her eyes tightly, body shivering  lightly as the hot wet body behind her rubbed against her back. The  motion lasted a little while longer before the girl doing it started  to slow down and instead opted to just hug her tightly. She returned  the hug by leaning back into it but a soft sob made her open her eyes  again and turn her head. Nanoha had her eyes closed tightly with  tears coming from them, quietly crying into her shoulder.  “Nanoha-chan, what is it? What’s wrong?” She turned within the  hold and pulled the girl into her lap so she was sitting sideways  between her knees. “What is it? Are you okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m scared,” She  managed out, holding onto her tighter. “For so long we’ve been  apart, o-only seeing each other a week or so a month, sometimes less.  Now-now we’re here…” Nanoha pulled back enough to look up at  her friend. “We’re to-together again,” He voice started to  break more as she cried. “I’m scared I’m dreaming and I’ll  wake up at any moment! I’ll be-be back on the Asura alone!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha…” Fate  pulled the crying girl against her gently, shushing her quietly in  her ear. “Don’t be scared, this isn’t a dream.” She whispered  to her, rubbing her arm with one hand and supporting her back with  the other. “Ssshhh, don’t cry, Nanoha. I’m here; I won’t go  anywhere I promise.” She felt Nanoha nod against her neck but she  still didn’t let go. “I told you before right? We would both work  hard to reach our goal, and then we would be together again.” She  gently kissed the girl’s temple. “We’re here now, Nanoha. It  took us a while but for now on we will be together. We climbed the  ranks and now we won’t be separated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?” Nanoha  looked up at her, the steam from the hot water showing the path her  tears had traveled down her cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really,” Fate  cuddled her. “So don’t cry. When you go to sleep tonight I’ll  be right there with you, and when you wake up I’ll still be there…  Unless I get hungry, in that case I’ll be in the kitchen.” The  joke worked like she had hoped and Nanoha laughed. “So then, smile  for me?”  Her request was answered immediately and she couldn’t  help but lean down and kiss the girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate?” Nanoha  whispered against her lips, getting a soft humm in reply. “… I  was going to wait until we were going to go to sleep but…” She  leaned up and kissed her again, shifting her body so she had her arms  around her. “If you want to…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In the shower?”  Fate gasped out in-between Nanoha’s persistent kissing. She didn’t  get an answer verbally but soon found Nanoha’s hand rubbing her  stomach in a slow circle. Moments passed and soon the kissing grew  more frantic, hands more daring. Before long Fate found herself  pinned under the water spray, coming down on her from all sides and  Nanoha soon on top of her, kissing sloppily in her passion.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate woozily walked out  of the bathroom, dazed from the two hour long intimate relation she  just spent with her girlfriend as well as getting overheated from  staying in there so long. The bed was cool and she thankfully fell  onto it face first, spreading out as if to make her body cool off as  fast as it could. Her damp hair covered her naked body, serving to  make her feel at least a little bit modest after their love making.  Nanoha followed her example, falling onto the bed as well. She chose  rather to lay on her back and cut the lights out to cover her body  from sight. The two laid there quietly several moments before Fate  finally got cold and crawled over to her friend to share her warmth.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha accepted gladly  and embraced her lover lightly, kissing her neck and shoulder softly  in greeting. A sudden impulse made her bite down, sucking harder than  normal on the soft spot between her neck and shoulder. The action  made Fate gasp out huskily, followed by a soft purring sound. She  molded her body up next to hers and wrapped her arms around her back,  rubbing in an encouraging motion to continue what she was doing.  Nanoha eagerly accepted and started trailing kisses down Fate’s  collar bone, quickly making her way to her chest, where she proceeded  to leave several small bruises from nipping and sucking on her skin.  “Na-Nanoha!? Again?!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We might as well  break the bed in too?” She purred, taking both her hands in her own  and gently kissing down her stomach and going lower…</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Sir,  it is morning, please wake up.” Bardiche’s  electronic voice floated into the room at five AM sharp.  “It  is time for your morning run.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bardiche, be quiet…”  Fate muttered, still half asleep. “Set snooze: five minutes.” The  girl heard a soft beep and lazily closed her eyes again, curling up  next to a still sleeping Nanoha. The covers were pulled up to both  their shoulders to cover their naked bodies and attempt to keep warm  in the cold room. Just as soon as Fate started to drift off again,  Bardiche’s voice once again interrupted her. “Be quiet,” She  muttered once more. “Set Snooze: ten minutes…” Again the beep  was heard and she wrapped her arms around her lover, making her  mumble something about food and turn over so she was on her back.  Fate shifted along with her, taking the moment to get under her arm  and rest her cheek against her neck and shoulder.  She felt herself  be embraced halfly by the sleeping girl and once again started to  drift off as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sir, please wake up  and prepare for the day.” Bardiche spoke again at the destined  time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate sighed, mentally  running ideas through her head. “Bardiche, I didn’t sleep much  last night, please set snooze for 06:00 hours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Understood.” The  beep came a third time and Fate sighed out contently. The girl fell  asleep again, peacefully dreaming once more. Time went by slowly for  her as she stayed in a limbo between being asleep and awake, never  quite reaching one or the other but still enjoying not having to move  away from the woman she made love with the night before… twice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“06:00 hours, Alarm  set. Please wake up, my master.” Raging Heart’s voice spoke up,  this time waking Nanoha.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sir, 06:00 hours has  been breached, please wake up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bardiche, if you  don’t let me sleep I’ll break you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sir, please wake up,  or the video recording of last night’s events will be sent to Amy  for blackmail.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You wouldn’t <em>dare!</em>” Fate was already across the room, holding Bardiche in  her hands, glaring at it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you for  waking, sir. Have a great day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate looked at her  device and sighed, knowing that if she slept in anymore she wouldn’t  be able to do anything before having to get to work. Turning her  head, she saw Nanoha greeting her inelegant devise with a brief kiss.  “Good morning, Nanoha-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Morning,” Nanoha  yawned in mid greeting, wincing at the sore spots on her body.  “Nyahaha, I’m beat.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That makes two of  us…”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha looked around  the mess hall, half amazed at seeing it getting full and half a  little disappointed because she wanted it to be mainly for her  division instead of for everyone nearby. She spotted her four  students and nodded over at Fate before heading over to them and  sitting down. “Good morning,” She greeted, getting salutes from  everyone. “Oh stop that, the mess halls are a place where all rank  is void, remember?” She smiled sweetly at them. “How are my cute  students today? Ready for another day of learning?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes ma’am!”  Subaru answered for the group. “We all ran into each other this  morning to jog and decided to try and make it an every day thing  together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s wonderful,  I’ll join you tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you not normally  run, Aunt Nanoha?” Elio asked, dropping the formalities as  requested.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aunt!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha ruffled Elio’s  hair, missing the other’s shocked faces. “Ah, I do. This morning  I was too tired to, however.” She reached into her purse and pulled  out the boxes of ammo. “I was planning on giving these to you at  practice but I might as well now since we met. Here you are, Subaru,  Tia, and Elio. I made these last night, they should last you until  you can make your own after training.” She slid the boxes toward  their respective owners.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wow… thank you,”  Subaru picked up a cartridge and smiled at it, feeling the magical  power radiate inside of it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So Nanoha-san is  your aunt?” Rushie asked, looking over at Nanoha.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, actually we’re  not related at all,” Nanoha smiled down at the red haired boy next  to her. “Fate is going to become his guardian, though her mother  will be the official signed parent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So why would he call  you ‘aunt’?” Tia pondered aloud. “Ah, I’m sorry, I  shouldn’t pry!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay,”  Nanoha laughed happily as Fate sat next to her and offered to share  the plate of food she got. “Thank you, Fate-chan.” She looked  back over at the confused faces in front of her. “Ah, well, here’s  a hint.” With that she leaned over and pecked Fate’s cheek,  making the three other girls at the table gasp out. “That’s how  it is,” She confirmed, making Fate more confused now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How sweet!” Rushie  exclaimed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh wow!” Subaru  added in, blushing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Somehow I knew  that,” Tia scratched her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha smiled happily,  taking in her new friends and students. ‘<em>Everything I going to  work out great,</em>’ she though to herself as she shared breakfast  with Fate. ‘<em>I can’t wait to get this day started!</em>’</span></p>
