<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My eyes went  wide when the palace in front of the Asura blasted apart, sending a  shock wave at us that cut off the monitors. “Fate?” I asked softly,  scared to death at the sudden turn of events. “Fate!?” I didn't quite  understand what had just happened. One moment she was there, right  there, in front of me. The next I heard her say she loved me and  then... Then I was here, alone. “Faaate!” My knees gave out and I fell  to the floor. '<em>This isn't right...</em>' My mind thought. '<em>Fate can't die... She's not allowed to die! I won't let her DIE!</em>'  I heard people scattering all around me and Chrono start barking out  orders but none of it made sense to me. I could no longer feel Fate  anymore, it was as if a part of my soul just got ripped violently  through my chest. I could feel my throat tighten up and I knew I was  crying but I felt so detached from my body I didn't even care right  now. If Fate was gone... Then... Why am I still here? It's not right,  she should be alive...Without Fate I don't <em>want</em> to go on, not  without her. The room became unfocused suddenly and I fell over, still  seeing but not really understanding anything anymore. Fate was  gone...The thought kept repeating inside of my head as they fussed over  me. I didn't want to deal with them right now, so I didn't even try to  refocus on anything. I was too sad, too confused, too... alone.</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is she okay?” Hayate screamed out as Yuuno caught the girl when she passed out. “Get the medical staff over here!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Scan the area!” Chrono yelled out his orders to the people looking at him. “I want every <em>inch</em> of space combed! Bring my Scaglietti's body and Fate!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But sir!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't  'but sir' me!” He retorted at them, infuriated. “Find my sister, you  hear me!?” Ignoring the stammered confirmation he turned back over  towards the group of people. “Nanoha...” His eyes went to the side  where Arf was hugging onto his mother tightly, eyes closed and crying.  “Arf, are you okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl shook her head. “I'm no longer receiving any energy from Fate...only Nanoha...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chrono punched the floor, leaving a small dent in the ground. “No... she's alive...she has to be...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lindy finally collapsed to her knees. “My little girl... My Fate...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate  held onto Nanoha while Yuuno held onto both of them. “She'll be okay,”  Yuuno encouraged her as much as himself. “Nanoha's strong, she was  running just earlier, she's just in shock, she'll be okay.” Looking up,  he yelled out. “Where's that medical team!?”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“How is she?” Vita asked immediately when Shamal walked out of the operating room. “Nanoha, is she okay!?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  doctor closed her eyes and sat down in one of the chairs next to Signum  and Hayate. “She's okay,” She confirmed right off to ease their  worries. “Her Linker Core is barren, she won't be able to cast magic  for almost a month. The Jewel Seed on her body exhausted most of it's  energy keeping Nanoha alive after she was attacked... Her back will  scar in several places but other than that she's okay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can we see her?” Vita spoke again for the group.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  Shamal shook her head. “She's getting a blood IV, I don't want anyone  in the room while she's not stable.” The blond turned to Signum. “Any  word from Fate?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...No.” She looked down at the floor. “We  cannot trace her or Bardiche. The explosion made the dimensional tear  collapse after a while. Anything in it is gone now, including  Scaglietti's body.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hearing the facts again made Hayate burst into a fresh set of tears. “I sent them,” She sobbed out loudly. “I sent them to <em>die</em>!” Her words steady got louder but Yuuno gripped her and pulled the close friend into a tight hug.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shush,”  He told her firmly. “You did the right thing at the time! Both of them  knew the risk!” He swallowed back his own tears and forced himself not  to cry right now. “Hayate, no one blames you. You saved <em>countless</em> lives by choosing this method and they agreed. I've known Fate longer  than you, and I know she wouldn't want you to behave like this, so pull  yourself together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-yes...” She wiped her eyes but still had a  steady stream of tears coming from them. “I-I'm going to see Chrono  again... Get an update...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You do that.” Yuuno let her go and  watched her leave. “I'm going to walk,” With just those words he left  the group but was followed by a worried Subaru. Rounding a corner he  stopped and put arm heavily against the wall and resting his forehead  against it. The blue haired girl was about to say something to him but  the male suddenly slammed his fist against the material. A few seconds  later he repeated the motion again and again, voice finally breaking  out as he collapsed into tears. Slowly Subaru sank back and returned to  the group of people waiting outside of the intensive care room and  noticed that Shamal was gone once again as well. Tia gave her an  inquisitive glance but only received a small shaking of her head.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha  opened her eyes slowly, blankly looking up at the ceiling. A steady  beeping sound came to her eyes, making her slowly look to the side to  see several machines with multiple wires running to her body.  “Fa...te...?” She looked the other direction to see if her fiancée was  over there. “Where's...Fate...?” She whispered, voice pained. Moments  later the door opened and Shamal stepped through it. The blond fussed  about at her desk for a few moments before tossing her papers down and  walked over towards her. “Fate...?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shamal stood still for several  seconds before rushing over towards the girl. “Nanoha? Nanoha!? Are you  okay? Do you hurt anywhere!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shamal shook her  head. “Nanoha, answer me, do you hurt anywhere?” She gripped her hands  and rubbed it. “We were so worried, you've been unconscious for three  days!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where's Fate...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha?” Shamal lost all of her  excitement. Her friend's head rolled over to look at her, blank eyes  not focusing. “Nanoha... Fate's...” She tried to figure out a way to  say it. “...Not here anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate,” Nanoha's eyes started to water. “My Fate...is alive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She'll come to me... She will.” Her voice was still mono toned, eyes glazed. “My Fate...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  doctor licked her lips as she stood. Her right hand reached for a small  pen light and leaned over her friend to open her eyes more and shine  the light into them. At once her eyes dilated but she showed no sign of  discomfort from it. “Oh no... No, Nanoha, no...” Carefully leaning  over, she embraced the girl. “Snap out of it Nanoha...Don't be like  this...”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Slowly the  blond sat up in bed, eyes unfocused and hazy. “Ow...” She complained,  rubbing her head ruefully. “What... What happened?” Looking around, she  noticed she was in a hospital room. “Where...am I?” At that point the  door across from her opened and revealed a rather shocked looking  nurse. “Hello,” She greeted. “...Where am I?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're awake!” She stated the obvious. “My girl, you have been in a coma for almost five days!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I... I have...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  we were so worried! You were found on the street nearby with your  weapon. We tried to get your information but it was completely drained  of energy and we thought you weren't going to make it at first! Can you  answer a few questions for me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I...I think so?” She rubbed her red eyes, trying to gather the facts.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, just try and relax. We'll start out with something easy okay? What is your name?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My...  name?” She felt her head hurt at the simple question and she quickly  yelped out, gripping it with both hands. “My name... I...I don't  know...” Turning, she looked at the nurse full of fear. “Why... Why  don't I know my name?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh my...” She looked worried. “Can you tell me anything? What happened to you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I...  I don't know...” The blond held her head tighter. “I can't...  nothing... I don't... it's blank...Where am I? Who am I? What am I  doing here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Calm down, there!” The woman put her hands on the  shaking girl's shoulders. “You just hit your head, lets take this one  step at a time. Relax. There you go...take a breath... Good.” She  slowly released the girl and started scribbling onto her notepad. “I'm  sorry, please work with me as best you can okay?” She got a small nod.  “Do you hurt anywhere?” The red eyed girl pointed to her head.  “Anywhere besides there? Sharp pains, aching muscles, sore spots?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, just my head. I feel drained.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your  linker core is dangerously low. You should rest for now, I'll get a  doctor to come speak with you shortly okay?” She wrote a few more  things down. “I'll be right back, make yourself comfortable.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Okay...”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is  she going to be okay?” Subaru asked softly as they watched Nanoha walk  into her loft apartment and look around. “She seems... spaced out. More  than usual, I mean...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She is in a state of advanced shock,”  Shamal told the group while Nanoha picked up a random object and  inspected it with blank eyes. “It's not uncommon after experiencing a  life changing situation... Having Fate sacrifice herself to get Nanoha  to safety really messed her up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is there nothing you can do?”  Vita demanded, pointing to the girl who was aimlessly walking around.  “We can't leave her like this!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She needs time,” Shamal looked  away. “Right now she has lost her desire to live... We all need to be  there for her, to get her ready to face the world again. That's why for  now on we're going to watch after her in sections. I don't want her  alone at any moment. I don't think she would try to hurt herself  purposely but the way she's acting I don't think she will take proper  care of herself either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How long do you think she'll be like this?” Caro asked softly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A few days probably. Yuuno, I want you to stay with her first since you was the first of us to meet her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But-!” Vita had a hand placed on her head before she could protest anymore.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Vita, trust Shamal for now, okay?” Signum ruffled her hair slightly to try and calm the girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well  then,” Yuuno nodded to them and walked into the room. “Nanoha,” His  words made her turn and look at him, a small smile on her face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno-kun,” She greeted him as she walked towards the boy. “What brings you here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I'm going to stay with you a bit if that's okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm. I don't mind,” Another smile. “I'll cook you dinner while we wait for Fate to come back okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha...” He saw her turn and walk from him. “Fate's...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hm?” She looked over her shoulder, still smiling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You have to accept it, Nanoha...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She's not dead!” Nanoha turned around quickly, a slight steam of tears from her eyes. “Don't say it! Don't you <em>dare</em> say it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha, whoa, calm down!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't want to calm down!” She stormed over to him but collapsed half way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha?  Nanoha!?” Scooping her up, her quickly carried her to the bed and laid  her down. “Hold on I'll call Shamal back...” His voice trailed when she  stirred. “Nanoha?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno-kun,” She greeted, smiling again. “...I'm in bed?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Yeah. You said you wanted to rest so I carried you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, thank you.” She closed her eyes and laid back. “I am a little tired.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno took her hand and rubbed the top of it, getting a confused but happy look from her. “Nanoha?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know it is hard waiting,” He chose his words carefully, lest she snap  again. “But we're here for you. If you ever want to talk or anything,  just ask me okay? I'll be there for you, just as you was for me all  those years.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm okay,” She protested good naturedly, another  false smile that ripped into Yuuno's heart. “I'm just waiting for Fate  to come back. You'll see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Mm.” He kissed her hand. “Okay. Time will tell. Take it one day at a time, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smiled yet again. “That's right. She'll come back to me, my Fate.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Hello,” The doctor greeted the blond girl as he stepped into her room. “How are you today?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good,” She replied easily. “I can go out today?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  sure can,” He checked over her charts. “Your device is almost repaired  and charged,” He added in. “You can walk around the hospital and enjoy  the park we have but please do not leave the premises until we can be  sure you are okay, all right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes sir.” She slid her feet out from the bed and placed them onto the cold floor, gently standing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Would you prefer a wheelchair?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'll  be okay,” Despite her words she stumbled and had to grab a hold of the  bed to keep from falling over. “Well, I will be shortly. You said I was  in a barrier Jacket?” She got a nod. “So does that mean I had clothes  under it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You did, they are in the closet.” He pointed with his  pen towards a small sliding door room across from the bed. “Enjoy  yourself today but don't overexert your body, you're still healing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  won't.” She bowed lightly as he left and opened the closet to take out  the clothes. Placing them on the bed, she observed them a while to see  if it would stir up any memories. A black bra and panties with purple  roses on them for her under clothes, topped with a black uniform  decorated on the left breast with various medals and symbols of rank.  “I was military,” She stated the already known fact. “An...Enforcer...”  Slowly getting dressed, she let her mind wander. “I seem to like  black.” Her hands went on auto pilot, guided by muscle memory. Before  long she stood in front of a mirror to inspect herself. “Not half bad,”  Her mind mused. “It's a little stiff but not bad...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Walking out  into the hallway, she took a small moment to look around. The area  around her was unfamiliar and dreadfully repetitive. She took a note of  the room she was in and noticed the name title was blank. '<em>Well,</em>' She mused as she began to walk. '<em>I'm  stuck somewhere I don't know, I don't remember my name or what military  base I'm from, and apparently I'm Missing in Action...Wait a minute,'</em> Her hands patted around on her uniform. '<em> I should have some type of identification or something...</em>'  Her searching came up with a few random items, which she observed after  sitting at a table on the bottom floor of the building that also seemed  to double as a type of cafeteria for the patients. '<em>Let's see here...A pack of breath mints; at least I seem to be curious of other people so that's a good thing.</em>' She put one of the mints into her mouth and set the rest aside. '<em>Hm, not bad. Okay, what else... A car key, too bad I don't even know what my car looks like...'</em> She set it aside and turned to the rest. '<em>A  key chain with some funny looking emblem on it... Oh wait, they said I  had a device, this must be it's embedded home so I don't lose it.</em>' Nodding, she slid it to the side and turned to look at what was still on that side. '<em>And  what we have left, a little piece of clear pressed plastic with a small  lock of hair in it? What the hell, why do I have a lock of brown hair?</em>' With a sigh she slid the contents back into her pocket. '<em> My device should have some information stored in it... I guess I don't  have any choice but to wait until it's fixed and returned to me.</em>'</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Hayate?”  Yuuno knocked on the door to her office a third time before pushing on  it slightly and watching it hiss open at his call. “Still working?”  Looking at her desk across the room he let out a sigh. “I say,  Hayate...” Walking over to her he looked down at the girl sleep  uneasily on her desk. “You shouldn't work yourself like this.” He shook  her softly. “Come on, wake up.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm... Wha?” The girl slowly sat up and rubbed her eyes. “Huh? Yuuno?” She tried to become more awake. “Did I fall asleep?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,”  He crossed his arms. “Look, I know you're worried but you killing  yourself like this won't solve anything. Go home. Get some rest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can't,” She shook her head. “Every time I try and relax I see Fate and Nanoha's expressionless eyes...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hayate...”  Reaching out he took her hand and lead her over to the couch in the  middle of the room. “It's not your fault. Really. I told you before,  they chose the mission.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But!” She shook her head. “I shouldn't have told them to go in the first place!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hayate!”  Yuuno put his arm around the girl and allowed her to cry against his  chest. “Hey now, listen. We all miss Fate, and all of us wish we were  there to help them, but we couldn't be. No matter if you told them or  not, I still would have done the math and brought it up. They still  would have chosen it and Fate still would have...” He shook his head,  trying not to think about it. “I love them too, and it's hard enough  seeing Nanoha so sad. I can't bear to see you lose it as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno...”  She gripped him hard around the waist and pushed her head against him.  “I'm sorry, it's just so painful... Her eyes...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shhh, I know. I  know, sweetheart, I know.” He hugged her. “The best thing we can do is  be strong for her, try and make her think again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who's with her now?” She stayed against him, trying to soak up some of his courage.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Vita. She's going to stay the night with her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,” He nodded even though she couldn't see him. “I'll cover your work tomorrow. You can stay with her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, what are friends for?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Yuuno?” She gripped his shirt a little harder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just for a moment...will you let me be spoiled? After that I promise... I promise I'll be strong.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  softened at the words, bringing one hand around her back and resting  his other on the back of her head. “Ah. I won't think any less of you.”  Hayate gripped his shirt harder as her body shook, voice finally  breaking in a sob. “Just let it all out, Hayate.” he held her close as  she finally allowed herself to break down and cry hard against him.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Vita  woke up slowly, looking around a moment when she didn't feel her  stuffed rabbit next to her. She spotted it across the bed from her and  remembered that she allowed Nanoha to sleep with it. “Nanoha?” She sat  up and looked around. A scent hit her nose, making her sniff a few  times. “She didn't...” The small girl crawled out of the large bed and  walked down the stairs slowly. “Nanoha?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hm?” The pony tailed girl  looked over to the side from her spot next to the window. “Good  morning, Vita-chan.” She smiled at her, eyes still blank. “Would you  like some coffee?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No thank you...” She knew Nanoha knew she hated coffee. “You started drinking it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nuh  uh,” She shook her head and Vita realized she was cuddling a large  stuffed bear. “Fate loves it, so I make it every morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vita's eyes teared up instantly. '<em>She hasn't given up yet, even though it's killing her...</em>' Slowly she walked over to Nanoha and wrapped her arms around her from behind. “Nanoha can I ask you something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, Vita-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You havn't given up on Fate yet have you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course not!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then...  Why are your eyes so blank?” She felt Nanoha stiffen in her arms so she  hugged her tighter. “I don't like it! Nanoha isn't Nanoha anymore!  You're just an empty shell, I don't like it at all!” Her childishness  started to break through the warnings Shamal had given her about her  words. “I want my Nanoha back! I want you to pat my head, to smile at  me! Fate wouldn't... <em>Fate wouldn't want you to be like this!!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha's  world stopped briefly, eyes finally coming into focus on the things  around her. The feeling started in her stomach, slowly creeping up her  neck until it spilled into her mouth. Her first gasp was rough, throat  clenching together as her tears started to form. “She's... she's really  gone isn't she?” Vita only hugged her harder. “Fate... Fate!” The last  straw broke, allowing her to finally scream out loudly. Turning, she  grabbed Vita so they were facing each other and hugged her tightly.  “Vita-chan! Vita-chan, Fate's...Fate's...!!!” Vita couldn't give her  any words of comfort, instead opting to push herself as tightly as she  could against her. Nanoha wrapped her arms around her tighter, sure she  was probably pulling the red head's hair but currently didn't care. All  she wanted was something to hang onto as she let out the emotions she  had repressed for so long.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The sobbing died down slowly before  picking back up again and once more slowing back down. Nanoha,  exhausted from the emotional outburst, was panting, trying to get air  back into her lungs after crying for so long. Her throat burned and her  nose was stopped up, forcing her to breath through her mouth. Finally  she managed to calm down enough to release her death grip on Vita and  pull away slowly, looking down at her as she sniffed softly. “Thank  you,” She told her friend softly, voice harsh and rough from the crying.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha?”  Vita reached up and touched the younger woman's cheeks, staring into  the eyes full of sadness. “Nanoha!” Flinging herself back against her,  Vita hugged her tightly. “You're back...Oh thank Elune, you're back!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  closed her eyes tightly, trying to keep herself from another crying  spell which she just couldn't handle right now. “I'm sorry,” She  managed out. “To make you worry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmn.” She agreed softly, unable to speak anymore, nuzzling against her chest.</span></p>

The  red eyed girl looked around as she walked down the halls of the  hospital and towards the area she was told to go. After double checking  the little note her nurse had given her with the door number she  knocked on it before being beckoned to enter. “Um, hello,” She greeted  the man across the room. Several machines were about, most of which she  noticed were for standard hospital use. “I was told by Dr. Light to  come see you to get my device back?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, you're the mage girl.” The  man nodded at her and walked across his large room. “Quite a surprise,  that day you came. My co-worker brought me a battered and broken mage  staff; said that the girl had no identification so I needed to fix up  the weapon to see if we could access it's storage drive and find out  info. Bet you anything they just wanted to know who to bill, but that's  between us, eh?” He winked at her. “Quite a device you have here. As  soon as it's energy core was charged it started healing itself with  almost no help from me at all. Drained my entire battery and half of  another one though. Gave my crew quite a shock when it locked us out of  it's programming.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” She looked at the yellow gem he  offered her and realized in the back of her mind that it would most  certainly fit on her key chain. Reaching out, she gasped loudly when  the gem turned into a staff at her touch. “W-wow...” Gripping it, she  observed Bardiche in it's battle form. Even though it was her first  time seeing it, the back of her mind didn't really find it that  interesting. “This is mine...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes sir!” It replied, making the girl yelp.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It spoke!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man laughed at her. “It's an intelligent device all right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The woman licked her lips. “What is your name?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bardiche, sir.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bardiche,” She repeated. “What is... my name?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate T. Harlaown, sir.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate...”  She repeated, tasting it. Amazingly it was familiar and new all at the  same time. “Bardiche,” She heard it confirm her once again. “Where do I  live?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Planet: Midchilda, first quadrant, Military base Delta in section six under command of Hayate Yagami.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  smiled at the information. “My home...Maybe there I can find out more.”  She thanked the mechanic and made her way out of the room before  hunting down the main desk on the bottom floor. “Bardiche, who is my  direct superior?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hayate Yagami.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blond let out a small whistle. “I'm pretty high ranked then, aren't I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes sir.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate hugged her device, very pleased with all that she was learning about herself. “Well then, let's contact her, shall we?”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Hayate  woke up slowly, bringing one hand up to rub her eyes “Huh...?” She  looked around a little confused, wondering why she was still in her  office. Looking down she noticed a familiar jacket had been placed  around her and after blinking realized that Yuuno was behind her, both  arms wrapped around her stomach as she laid on him. “Yuuno...?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The male woke up, opening his eyes and smiling at her. “Hey, you're awake.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why are we...?” She pulled his jacket up to get a little warmer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  fell asleep against me,” He informed her. “I was debating taking you  back to your apartment but you seemed really peaceful so I didn't want  to take the chance of you having another bad dream if I woke you, so I  just stayed still.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You stayed here...all night... just for that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Someone has to look after you,” He confirmed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate  blushed darkly, suddenly feeling rather hot for some reason. She was  saved having to reply to him by a black monitor appearing in front of  her. “Long distance communication request from:” A small silence passed  before Fate proudly declared her full name and rank. “Do you wish to  accept?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl looked at the monitor in shock for a few  seconds before Yuuno answered for her. “YES!” The screen asked them to  wait a moment before Fate's face appeared in front of them. “By the  light of Elune... FATE!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sir!” She saluted the two. “Permission to speak, Lieutenant Colonel Yagami?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate ignored her. “Fate! Oh my god, you're alive! Where are you!? Are you hurt!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma'am, I am on Zargon Five under the care of Dr. Thomas Light, ma'am! I was wounded in my last mission and woke up here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate  looked over at Yuuno, who was already concentrating on a long distance  teleport. “Give me the exact location of the teleport section there?”  She saw Fate look at Bardiche and suddenly an extremely long series of  number appeared on the screen. “Yuuno, can you make that jump?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Child's  play,” He confirmed, although he was sweating due to his concentration.  After a few moments he vanished out of sight leaving only a small trace  of smoke where he had once been.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno will be there shortly! Oh Fate, I was so worried.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My apologies, ma'am!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate wiped away her tears. “Stop being so strict! You never address me as ma'am!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't?” She asked, confused. “Isn't that how you are supposed to address your superior?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you okay Fate?” She started to worry. “You're acting strange...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  gave her a lopsided smile. “Actually, no ma'am. I seem to have lost all  my memories. I just learned my name a few minutes ago when I was given  Bardiche here,” She showed her staff to her, as if Hayate had never  seen it before. “You was the one I was supposed to contact, correct?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate fell to her knees, looking up at Fate with a shocked expression. “You... don't remember me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  am very sorry, ma'am.” Fate saluted her once again. “Ah, The man you  sent has arrived.” She looked over at Yuuno running at her with high  speed. “Sir,” She addressed him before getting tackled in a hug.  “S-sir!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate! It's really you!” He spun her around happily before hugging her tightly. “Nanoha will be <em>thrilled</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Who?”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha  sighed out, slowly eating a bagel. Her eyes were still red and puffy,  cheeks stained crimson from the excessive rubbing. Despite looking so  pitiful at the current moment, everyone seemed relieved to just have  her showing emotions again. Shamal had hugged her the hardest, pleased  that she had snapped out of her shock and was able to give her a proper  physical test done to make sure she was all right. Despite the sick  feeling in her stomach she still managed to finish off half of her  bagel and sigh sadly. “I'm going to cry again,” She stated softly and  instantly started getting hugs from everyone around her.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha,”  Hayate's sad voice caught her attention. “Come here please.” The woman  she addressed gave her an odd look but still came as commanded, using  the distraction to keep herself from breaking down once more. “We...”  She tried to think how to word the horrible and good news. “I...” She  sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. “God I can't say it... Come  with me,” She took her friend's hand and lead her away. “<em>Shamal,</em>” She contacted her guardian telepathically. “<em>When I leave with Nanoha, can you give everyone some good and bad news?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Yes?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>We found Fate,</em>” She let Shamal's instantly bombardment of questions subside before continuing. “<em>Her body is fine, yes, but she hit her head really hard...She... doesn't remember anything... Not even Nanoha.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I...see... Okay, I'll tell them... Good luck Hayate...</em>” Her sadness was clear despite not being able to speak verbally at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where are we going?” The flight instructor asked after a few minutes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To the air strip... Notice Yuuno has been gone all day?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,” She nodded lightly. “Investigating something for you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kind of...”  Hayate nervously rubbed her friend's hand. “Um, Nanoha... I have some...news... for you...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is it?” She looked confused. “You're acting very strange.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate  looked at the air strip up in the distance and saw a inter-planet  military jet land start coming in for a landing. “Well, you see...”She  stayed silent a moment longer as they walked up to the open area where  people waited to board the planes. “We found Fate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” Nanoha froze in mid step, grabbing Hayate and holding both her shoulders. “What did you say!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She's  alive, Nanoha, her body is fine now, just magically drained...” She bit  her lip, wanting to cry again when Nanoha's eyes lit up brightly.  “But!” She said it quickly, unable to look at her friend directly  anymore. “She hit her head... she has amnesia.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A-amnesia?” She  stammered, unsure if she heard right. “You mean... where someone  forgets things?” Hayate nodded lightly. “She... she doesn't remember  her name?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bardiche told Fate her name when it was repaired...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then, then she remembers things right? I mean... she'll remember <em>me</em> right? Right!? <em>Right Hayate</em>!?”  She gripped her harder, shaking lightly. “Answer me! She knows me  right!?” Following her eyes, Nanoha turned to look at the plane that  had landed and saw Yuuno step out of it. Ignoring Hayate she started  walking towards him, speeding up slowly as she did so. “Fate...?” A  person with blond hair left the plane next, helped down by her friend.  “Fate!?” She started running now, pushing past the people in her way.  “FATE!” the word made the blond look at her and meet her blue eyes with  the familiar crimson ones. “Fate!!!” She was running fully now, eyes  hazy with tears. The ground met her harshly when she tripped in her  hurry but she pushed up immediately, regaining her lost speed in almost  no time at all. Upon reaching her, Nanoha threw her arms around the  girl and let the momentum knock them both over onto the ground.  “Fate...” She couldn't seem to touch her enough, pulling her body  harshly close and rubbing whenever she could. “Thank god you're safe! I  was so, <em>so</em> worried!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um,” Fate spoke rather  uncomfortable. “Wh...Who are you?” Such simple words made Nanoha stop  her cuddling all at once but didn't merit her letting go.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is Nanoha,” Yuuno informed her softly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, Nanoha-san.” Fate spoke to her now. “Yuuno-san told me a lot about you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You...don't remember me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm  very sorry,” Fate apologized, pulling herself up and dusting off her  skirt before offering her a hand to help stand. “I can't remember  anything it seems.” She smiled fondly at her and helped the girl to her  feet. “The doctors say it could come back to me sometime but there's no  guarantee. Are you all right, Nanoha-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha wiped her eyes  with both arms, crying heavily. “Y-yes...” She sobbed out, pulling Fate  into another hug. Despite having a thousand things to say all at once  she couldn't seem to find the words she wanted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Somehow...” Fate  wrapped her arms around Nanoha and hugged her back, eyes closed with a  smile. “This feels really soothing... I guess we really are best  friends, huh?” Instead of an answer she was only embraced tighter.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Is this where I live?” Fate pondered as she stepped into her apartment and looked around. “Wow this is really nice.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hayate-chan  tried really hard to get us a great room,” Nanoha whispered to her, not  able to seem to speak fully just yet. The past few hours had been hell  on her as Fate was 'introduced' to all of her friends and the heart  breaking looks she received. Shamal had suggested that Fate take it  easy for a moment as to not be overwhelmed by everything all at once  and reminded them to go easy on the information until Fate could soak  it all up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We live together?” The red eyed girl walked into the  living room and observed the many pictures on the walls. “It's  strange,” she began as she touched the smooth glass of the picture. “I  see myself but I don't recall ever being there...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Those were fun time,” Nanoha assured her, following her as she walked around. “Yes, we both live here. For almost a year now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” She smiled as she continued to look around, one hand running along her couch. “Who decorated?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Both of us, Hayate-chan had the furniture picked out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I like it,” She continued to the stairs leading to their bedroom. “Is this your bedroom or mine?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ours,” the word broke as it left. “Ours,” She repeated again, this time more stable. “This is our bed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  sleep together?” She observed the bed. “It is big enough, I suppose...”  Crawling onto it, she looked at the mass of pinned up pictures above  their headboard. “We really love taking pictures don't we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You do,” Nanoha sat on the bed and looked at her, suppressing the urge to touch. “You take at least three or more a week.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wonderful!” Fate looked back at her and smiled. “Maybe I can remember some things if I look at them!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,”  Nanoha nodded. “Bardiche,” she spoke out, getting confirmed. “please  display photo album.” Shortly after several transparent books appeared  around them, each labeled with a year.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can access my device?” Fate looked impressed. “Wow, no one could do that but me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We have shared access,” She replied softly, fighting back another wave of tears. “You can access Raising Heart as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see,” Fate sat beside her but kept a modest amount of distance between  them. “I guess I should look at the latest book, as it will be easiest  to remember.” Reaching up, she touched it to open the book of small  images. “Amazing how I know how to work my device and how to walk and  talk, even the names of objects, but I can't remember people. I wonder  how that works?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No idea,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anyway,” Fate reached up again and touched the first image.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  first time in our new apartment, Fate T. Harlaown looks out over the  bedroom balcony!” Nanoha's recorded voice declared, showing an image of  Fate from the chest up. The blond smiled happily and pressed the 'next'  button, seeing Nanoha sitting on the very bed she was currently on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  is so weird,” She made conversation as she flipped through the images,  sometimes being greeted with sound. “Wow there are a lot of them in  here. Who's this little boy again? So many names all at once I can't  keep track.” She pointed at a picture of Elio</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio...” Nanoha looked down sadly. “He's your... little brother.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have a little brother!?” She seemed amazed. “Where are my mother and father?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your mother is on another planet right now, along with your familiar.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have a familiar!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm... you do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wow,” She said the word again, flipping through the images. “I seem to be really happy in these?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” Nanoha finally gave in and moved closer to her. “You're very happy here. Always smiling. Everyone loves you...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you,” Fate looked over at her and smiled nervously. “Um...I know we're  friends and all but... This is a little uncomfortable...Could  you...scoot away just a little?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha looked as if she had just  been stabbed. “Oh... okay...” Standing, she blinked several time to  keep herself from crying. “Would you like a drink or anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  looked at her sadly. “I-I'm sorry... I didn't mean to hurt you. It's  just I'm really unsure about things right now, Nanoha-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was my mistake,” She shook her head. “A drink? Something to eat?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um, anything to drink please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“One  moment.” Nanoha waved at her lightly before walking down the stairs and  over into the kitchen. Putting her back against the refrigerator, she  slowly sank down to the floor. Bringing her knees up she hugged them  tightly, finally letting her tears flow into her stockings while Fate  looked through her photo album upstairs.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“That shower is really amazing,” Fate told Nanoha as she stepped into her bedroom fully dressed in some of her nightclothes.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn't it?” Nanoha offered her a small smile. “We take long showers normally.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” another phrase she repeated all day long. “Well, tell me a little about you. We're best friends right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More than best friends...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What was that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing,” she waved it off, too upset to linger on it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh!” Fate grabbed her hand and looked at the ring on Nanoha's finger. “Is this an engagement ring!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Again the girl felt a sharp pain in her chest. “...Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You have a fiancé?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Something like that, yes.” She looked away as Fate fawned over her ring. “Someone very special...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I bet, when is the wedding? Am I in it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha changed the subject, too upset to keep on. “Are you tired? Do you want to sleep?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm  okay, I want to look around more,” She seemed pleased at being able to  see so many things that were hers but she didn't know she had. “Is this  my side?” She pointed at the dresser by the bed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah... The top drawer is our stocking and things, second is your underwear drawer, third is mine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Fate opened the top drawer and looked into it. “Assuming black is mine?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm. You love black. Purple and gold too, your three favorite colors.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate opened the second drawer and laughed. “I can tell! Haha, wow. So I own anything <em>not</em> black?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A few things,” Nanoha felt herself smile lightly. Fate was still Fate, even without her memories.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What's in this drawer?” Fate sat on her knees and reached to the bottom drawer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't  open that one!” Nanoha instantly fell off the bed, pushing it close  before Fate could look in it. “That's, um...” Her cheeks colored.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” Fate tilted her head to the side. “Is this your drawer?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, no, it's <em>ours</em> but...” She looked nervous. “I don't think you're ready to see in it just yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  want to see then,” Fate pulled on the drawer a little more but Nanoha  stopped her. “Nanoha-san? There might be something in here that gives  me a memory or something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha swallowed nervously, slowly moving her hand away. “...Okay...” She wouldn't mind it at all if she recalled <em>those</em> memories.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  opened the drawer and looked into it. “What's this?” Reaching in, she  blushed darkly when the contents became apparent. “Th-This is ours!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Mm...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate slammed the door closed. “Well,” She laughed nervously. “Wow, we really <em>are</em> good friends, huh?” She scooted away when Nanoha tried to touch her.  “Um, I think I will get in bed after all .” slowly she stood up,  keeping her distance from Nanoha. “I'm going to sleep on the couch okay  Nanoha-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What!? No, no way!” She stood as well. “You're <em>not</em> sleeping on the couch!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But, I'm...” She looked down at the drawer. “Really not comfortable right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  grabbed her two favorite pillows and walked past her. “I'll sleep on  the couch, Fate, so rest well okay?” She moved to give her a hug but  the blond looked at her nervously. “Right then... Sleep sweet.” Walking  past, she made her way down the stairs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-san!?” The girl looked up at her. “I'm really sorry...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't worry about it. You're safe, that means a lot to me. Get some rest, we'll talk more tomorrow okay?”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Nanoha-san?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning,” she greeted her as Fate walked into the kitchen. “Hungry?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Starving,” She confirmed, looking around the kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have  some breakfast, I was just about to bring it up to you,” Nanoha sat the  plate in front of the bar followed by a cup of coffee.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” Fate sat on one of the barstools and started to eat. “This is really yummy. Do you normally cook?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nuh  uh,” She shook her head, leaning against the counter to talk to her.  “You always cook for us.” She watched Fate look at the coffee a moment  before picking up the cup and smelling it. After staring into it for a  few moments she closed her eyes and sipped it slowly. “...Is it good?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  exhaled, eyes still closed. “Feels...Nostalgic...” She spoke her mind.  “For some reason... I feel so...” A single tear ran down her cheek. She  opened her eyes and wiped the tear from her face. “My chest hurts...as  if there's something I should know...” She watched Nanoha walk around  and stand next to her. “Is there something related to this taste?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm, you could say that. A daily habit we have.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What's the rest of it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She stepped closer to her. “May I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Uhn?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  hugged Fate, surprised when she was embraced back. “You drink your  coffee while I go over my training schedule, then I head out to work  and I would hug you like this every morning, and then...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  then?” She inhaled the scent of Nanoha's hair, finding it exceedingly  soothing despite how awkward she felt doing it. A truly complicated  feeling washed over her as Nanoha pulled back just enough to give a  gently kiss to her left temple.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I would kiss you,” she whispered against Fate's hair. “And you would say:”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have  a great day, Nanoha.” Fate finished for her, eyes closed tightly. “I  almost.. I almost remembered something...” She looked up, scared. “Was  that right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” Nanoha smiled at her sadly. “It was right. Good job, Fate. We'll get your memories back, won't we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We will,” She nodded. “And... I'm sorry. About last night. I know we're supposed to be really close but-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's okay, anyone would be freaked out after that. Don't worry about it, just focus on remembering okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Fate-san?” Elio ran over to her as she walked across their path after their training session with Vita. “How are you?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate looked down at the boy and then at the two girls chasing after him. “Umm... Eriol, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio,”  He corrected her, pressing down the rough feeling. “How are your  memories? Have you recalled anything yet?” Looking to his sides, he  noticed Caro and Lutecia next to him again. Fate looked at the two,  trying in vain to recall their names. “Caro,” Elio motioned to the pink  haired on. “And Lutecia. You call them by their first names.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see,” Fate's line was repeated for the hundredth time. “Hello there,”  She sat down to talk to them better. “I saw lots of pictures of you  two, I'm sorry I can't recall it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-san...” Caro looked as if she was about to lose it. “Are you okay? Is it painful?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's  weird,” Fate admitted to them. “I have this urgent desire to figure out  who I am but... I can't be sad because I don't know what I'm missing...  It's as if I have no cares or worries or problems. I just... don't have  a past. For some reason, deep down, I feel as if the past doesn't  really matter and it's the future that counts. I'm focusing on that to  keep me sane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The male nodded, knowing her past more than Caro did. “Do you... know about me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  heard you're my little brother,” She smiled down at him and ruffled his  hair. “Let's spend some time together soon okay, Elio-chan?” She  ignored his blush at the sudden pet name for him. Looking at the girls  beside him she smiled. “Are these your girlfriends?” She teased.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” Lutecia confirmed, grabbing Elio's arm.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He's mine too,” Caro stated, taking his other arm and making Elio smile nervously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wow,  my little brother is popular.” She grinned. “That's good to know.” Fate  allowed him to stutter a moment before smiling at the three and  standing up fully. “I need to be off, can you point me in the direction  of Hayate Yagami's office?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Over there,” Caro pointed at the building, a weird feeling washing over her. “I can walk with you if you would like?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's okay, thank you little one.” Fate pet her head before waving at the trio. “Nice to talk with you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-yeah...”  Elio waved at her with a fake smile and let it all fall when she turned  her back. “I don't know how long I can keep smiling...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Be  strong,” Lutecia offered him quietly. “It must be hard, but the doctor  said the best thing for her right now is the smiles from her friends.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate  knocked on Hayate's door and saluted her when she was bid entrance.  Nanoha was on the couch, back turned to her and moving as if she was  wiping her eyes. “Reporting, ma'am.” The blond hailed the two. “Please  forgive my tardiness, I went the wrong way for a little while to get  here.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop calling me 'ma'am' please,” Hayate requested, voice  trying to stay cheerful. “We're friends and that won't change no matter  what.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm sorry,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And stop apologizing,” Hayate really did smile now. “It's okay, we understand. No one blames you for anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” Her red eyes looked over at Nanoha, who was seemingly calming herself down. “Nanoha-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?”  She turned around cheerfully but her smeared makeup revealed that she  had been crying. “You ready for lunch? I thought we could go get some  food at Fuji's.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Great idea!” Hayate nodded happily. “Fate, you'll really be happy there, it's sort of our un-official meeting place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds fun.” She smiled at them briefly before a red monitor flashed around all of them. “What's this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  scramble!” Hayate realized, waving her hand out to get the details sent  to her. “Local police force in in pursuit of a group of mages and  request back up!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'll go,” Nanoha flashed into her barrier jacket. “I need to release some stress.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't  hurt them,” Hayate warned as she ran out of the office. “This is  Yagami,” She addressed the man giving the call. “I deployed my top Ace  to your position, her call is Stars one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma'am! Thank you!” He looked insanely surprised to be getting help at all. “We're indebted to you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whenever  you need help, section six will come through for you,” She told him  with a small smile. “Please never hesitate to ask us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate looked at Hayate with a newfound respect. “You're really kind, has anyone told you that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sometimes,”  She smiled at her life long friend. A moment passed in silence between  them. “I can't go right now until this is over, can we take a rain  check for dinner?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,” She nodded and went to salute but  Hayate caught her arm. “Sorry, for some reason it's a habit when I see  more rankings than myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,” The shorter girl gave Fate's hand a small squeeze. “Have you remembered anything lately?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Feelings,” She confirmed. “Everything feels so nostalgic but I can't place anything. When I see people my emotions change.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you feel around me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A calm feeling. I really respect you, and I feel that if you should say anything I should really take it to heart.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate blushed. “And Nanoha?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  time Fate's cheeks colored. “Weird... my heart aches when she looks so  sad. I feel as if a part of me is crying. I want to...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Want to what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing, it's silly. We're both girls.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're her fiancée.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm what!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate covered her mouth. “Oh my god I wasn't supposed to say that until you were more comfortable!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My... my... I'm...” She shook her head. “We're...!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Calm down Fate, take a breath.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  breath? You just told me I'm engaged! To someone I don't even know! Oh  my god no wonder she was so sad... I said such careless things!” Tears  came to her eyes all at once. “Wha-what?” She wiped them quickly “Why  am I crying? Why do I feel like this!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate...” She held the  girl when she suddenly collapsed onto her and sobbed out. “Try and  remember, Fate... Remember her, if only just her! You love her, deep  down. I know you must still feel it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't understand,” She  coughed out, pulling Hayate closer. “I do but I don't! I want her to  touch me but I don't! My body tells me to hug her but my mind says to  stay away!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate...”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate  turned the page in the photo album, bringing up the images one by one  in front of her. Hayate had calmed her down enough to collect her  thoughts and make it back to her apartment but her chest was still  aching. The news that she was engaged was too much, and for the first  time she felt an earth shaking sadness at not knowing what she lost.  “Bardiche?” The familiar greeting met her ears. “Is it possible to  organize these so only pictures of Nanoha and myself are shown?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Which album?” It requested of her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have album saved like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes sir. Many.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um, the most recent ones, since we started living here together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Two albums,” It replied. “Album one: Section Six. Album two: Private.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Private?”  She repeated curiously but Bardiche brought it up in front of her.  “...Password?” She thought hard. “Um... Fate?” She got a negative  answer. “Nanoha?” again another negative. “Fate- Nanoha? Nanoha-Fate?  Ugh...Bardiche, what is Nanoha-san's last name?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Takamachi, sir.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha Takamachi?” She frowned. “Wait a minute...Bardiche, my name is what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate T. Harlaown.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What does the 'T' stand for?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing. You kept it during your name change as a memory of how you overcame your hardships.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see...” She looked at the screen. “Enter password... Fate Takamachi  Harlaown.” the words came up as she spoke and soon the book opened,  allowing her to flip through the pages. Her cheeks colored, viewing the  several pictures that all had the two girls in random poses kissing and  hugging each other. Carefully she observed each one, feeling the  pressure in her chest swell. “A movie?” She pondered, pushing the play  button next to the image.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Far in the light, I can see it. In every scene of the night: a tiny feather of love.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  blinked, the song suddenly greeting her as well as the voices of girls  she didn't know. “Hey, you hear that?” Nanoha's voice came up and the  people recording the movie zoomed in on Fate and Nanoha dancing. “It's  our song, what are the odds!?” The girls were suddenly in a spotlight  as the light's dimmed. “Hey... What's going on?” She asked suddenly,  looking around. Several giggles came around by the people recording,  followed by shushing sounds. “...Fate-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is...” She  suddenly realized as she watched herself kneel down in front of Nanoha.  “I proposed to her...” her eyes stayed on the video and felt a funny  happy feeling in her gut when Nanoha passed out on her. “She fainted,”  She spoke aloud, grinning. “How cute...” The video cut off then and  came back when she pushed the play button on the next image. The blond  couldn't help but smile at the new scene, showing Nanoha answering her  and hugging. “She was so pretty that night...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her eyes went wide  as the smell of Nanoha's hair came back to her, the feeling in her  chest when she was hugged, and most of all the sheer happiness when she  realized that she would be married to her. “That night...” She held  herself, leaning over as she listened to the audio. “She...She...” She  thought hard, hearing Nanoha scream out loudly that she was engaged and  everyone laughing at her. “and she said that we were going to raise a  family, with a little boy and girl...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Family...” Nanoha's voice came up softly from the film. “We're going to get married and have a family!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“With a little boy and girl,” Fate's voice came down as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate looked up in shock, almost seeing Nanoha in front of her hugging and declaring her love. “This... These are..!!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm home,” Nanoha's voice came up from downstairs</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">'<em>Her keys on the coffee table'</em> Fate thought desperately before hearing the small clinking sound. '<em>Her boots kicked off...</em>' Nanoha's boots thunked lightly as she carelessly tossed them off. '<em>I remember... I remember!</em>' Standing, she looked at her lover walk across the living room. “Nanoha... <em>Nanoha</em>!!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate?” She looked up, shocked, as the blond literally ran down the stairs and knocked her over in a hug. “Wha, what!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!” She repeated, grabbing the back of her head and smothering her in several kisses. “Nanoha! God, I missed you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate...?” She looked up, eyes wide in shock. “You...?” She got several happy nods at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love you so much, Nanoha...” She was starting to cry again, eyes protesting the action but not being able to stop it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate...”  Without warning she grabbed the girl and pulled her down hard, holding  her so close it hurt. “You're back...” Already her voice was breaking.  “My Fate... My beloved Fate!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,” She confirmed softly, unable to speak anymore. “Mm!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  two stayed on the floor for a long time, crying softly at everything  they had gone through the past week. “How,” Nanoha asked softly when  she could. “How did you...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm not sure,” Fate whispered back,  finally pulling away and allowing them to breathe. “I was going through  out photo album and I saw the video when we got engaged and it... It  just came back. Just like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just like that?” Nanoha gave her a choking laugh. “You never stop amazing me...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm so sorry,” she went on. “For everything I said, I hurt you so bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's  okay, I'd go through it all over again if it meant having you back.”  She reached up and ran a finger along her cheek. “Tho, I'll never  forgive you for what you did back then on that mission.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't  expect you to,” Fate countered, leaning down to kiss her again several  times. “You would have done it too if you thought of it first, I know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut  up,” She gripped her again. “Tell me, what really happened that day?”  Fate went to move off of her but Nanoha pulled her back down. “Don't  let go! Don't let go yet...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,” The two rolled over so they  were on their sides. “After you teleported I was blown down the tunnel  we flew up to get to Scaglietti. I landed in the room we fought Zest in  and I collapsed. An explosion knocked me down the hole your distortion  bomb made and I was laying there, about to give up, and I saw something  sparkling in the light.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What was it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'll tell you if  you let me?” She kissed Nanoha once again. “When I was fighting Zest I  went to reload Bardiche but a blast made me lose the entire clip. It  fell through the hole and I used another to start fighting again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you found the one you lost?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,”  She kissed her once again to keep her quiet so she could finish. “I  loaded it in and started to teleport but something cracked me upside  the head before I made it out... I guess Bardiche attempted to finish  the spell for me when I was knocked out. I manged to teleport but I  ended up way in the middle of nowhere. Dimensional tears are like worm  holes so I guess that's how I ended up on a planet so far away.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wow,” Nanoha shook her head. “That's something straight out of one of those science fiction novels I read.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  that isn't the point...I can remember everything now. The people at the  hospital took real good care of me until Yuuno picked me up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm glad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  two stayed on the floor a moment longer; simply content to hold each  other. “Let's get in bed,” Fate offered softly. “Tomorrow is going to  be busy.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“So Lutecia is  staying with Caro?” Fate pondered after sliding on her sweater. The  entire first six hours of her day was nothing but being hugged several  times over again by all of her friends and by now she was just happy to  have a moment to breathe. Although happy at everyone's feelings, she  wanted to put the situation behind her as soon as possible. An escape  came to her when it was revealed that the purple haired girl didn't  have any clothing to change into when Hayate gave everyone the day off  to celebrate having their Fate back. “Do they get along?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very well,  actually.” Nanoha confirmed as she slid on a skirt after changing out  of her uniform. “I was worried at first but they seem to be best of  friends already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate hopped a few times to get her tight jeans  up and zip them. “Sweetheart, put on something warmer, you'll freeze in  that skirt.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't like pants,” Nanoha countered with a smile  while Fate put on some lipstick. “I'm glad Lutecia decided to join the  forwards after all, she'll be a great addition.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As soon as the  paperwork is straightened out she'll be given her training uniform but  she still needs clothes.” The blond puckered up and kissed a random  piece of paper to remove the excess lipstick. “Ready?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Steady,”  Nanoha grabbed her purse and took Fate's hand as they left their  apartment and went to the elevator. “Caro-chan said she was going to  help pay for Lutecia's clothes and even Elio wanted to chip in when he  found out as well, but why did you decide to take her in the first  place?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you know, I can't let a girl go without clothes...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  slowly pieced it all together. “Ah! You're going to take care of her  while she's here aren't you?” The look on Fate's face confirmed it.  “Mou, we almost <em>die</em> and you lose your memories and then once we  finally get together again you go and see another poor child that needs  a family...” She put her head against the wall by Caro's door. “My  wallet is going to hurt so bad after taking care of three children...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don't have to-!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm not going to let a child go without clothes, especially if you've already decided to look after her! You're half mine too!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello!”  Caro greeted them happily, making the older women cut off their  conversation. “Sorry for the wait.” She stepped out into the hallway,  revealing her thick pants and long sleeved shirt. “I was trying to find  something for Lutecia-chan so she wouldn't freeze.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl in  question slowly came outside as well by the encouragement of Caro's  hand. Lutecia stood in a pair of bluejeans, held in place by a belt,  and a slightly baggy blue long sleeve shirt that was obviously Elio's.  “Hello,” She greeted them, still not used to seeing the leaders of the  squad. Fate she knew but her interactions with Nanoha were limited at  best and also not on very good terms. As an afterthought she bowed to  them each. “Thank you for taking me.” To her surprise she found a hand  on her head, ruffling her hair. Looking up, she saw Fate leaning over  lightly and smiling at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello,” Nanoha added in, crouching  down to be more eye level with her. “Our first introduction was a  little awkward and I havn't really been myself the past little while  so... why don't we try again? I'm Takamachi Nanoha, you can call me  Nanoha if you'd like?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia blushed darkly. “I'm Lutecia.” When the girl tilted her head to the side she continued. “I don't have any other name.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can I call you Lutecia-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you want...” The girl looked down, embarrassed at being treated so nice  by the woman who almost had her life destroyed because of her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  past is the past,” Nanoha whispered to her so no one else would hear.  “If you hadn't done what you've did, I would still be constantly scared  for my life. Because of you, I made a new friend and no longer have to  be scared every time I close my eyes. So actually I should be thanking  you.” She smiled when Lutecia gave her a shocked look. “I know what you  went through from the reports, so I just want to say, we're all family  here...almost literally... so welcome to the dysfunctional group of  section six.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Thank you.” Lutecia bowed again, deeper this time.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“So,”  Nanoha mused as she watched the two girls walked around the clothing  store in the mall along with the very embarrassed Elio. “On a scale of  one to ten, how uncomfortable do you think Elio is, holding their  clothes?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'd say a seven.” Fate smiled and put an arm behind the  bench they were sitting on and was rewarded with Nanoha scooting a  little closer to her. “You know, we could have just told Hayate-chan  and saved us the money.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And let <em>her</em> pick out outfits? Remember the last time we made that mistake?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You won the pageant you was in didn't you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate, it was a <em>cosplay</em> pageant. I was a bunny-girl.” Nanoha sighed at the memory.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well the playboy staff <em>did</em> request you to pose for them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was fourteen! I'm lucky I wasn't scarred for life!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate pointed at the store. “Oh look, Caro just made Elio hold more clothes while she's changing!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He's  so red!” The blue eyed girl instantly formed the yellow camera screen  and took a picture. “Lutecia just came out of the dressing room... Oh  she looks really cute!” The blond simply smiled, placing her arm around  Nanoha's shoulders and pulling her up next to her fully. “Hm? You're  normally not cuddly in public, Fate?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know, Nanoha?” She  looked up at the skylight above them. “I'm really happy right now.  We're simply taking children shopping but when I see them laughing and  smiling...I can't help but be really happy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's kind of like  we're a family, huh?” Nanoha pondered, watching the two girls tease  Elio. “I've been thinking...” The girl looked over at Fate. “That I may  adopt Caro-chan. For real.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why that all of sudden?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  when I think about her, the more I think about me when I was growing  up. People were always around me, I was always loved... But I felt a  little detached, as if I was the odd one out. I want to share the  feeling I missed with someone... I guess you understand that, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course. I wouldn't mind have Caro as a daughter either. Elio is my  brother so that would make them in-law siblings back on Earth wouldn't  it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm, but Midchilda doesn't have that. From what I can tell,  it's a good thing. She has the hots for him.” Nanoha shook her head  with an amused smile. “And yet they don't even know what it means...  Well maybe Lutecia does, she seems wise beyond her years.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  rubbed Nanoha's shoulder absently a while longer as the three shopped  still. “Hey... Do you want to start planning our wedding soon?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?” She looked over and up at her fiancée. “It's only just getting cold, I thought you wanted a wedding in the summer?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well... I came to realize that putting things off may lead to regretting it later.” Her red eyes closed. “When I was <em>there</em>, I only had one regret... I wanted to see you standing in front of me in a wedding dress.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate...”  Reaching up, she loosely took the hand around her shoulders and rubbed  the fingers. “Yes, let's start planning... One thing right now,  though?” She grinned up at her lover. “You would look <em>really</em> hot in a tuxedo.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Is this everything?” Fate wondered aloud while nibbling on a cookie they had all gotten from a random stand.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-yes,” Lutecia blushed darkly. “You bought me more than I could ever ask for.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh!”  Caro looked over at Elio a moment before motioning Nanoha to lean down.  She whispered into the woman's ear softly a moment before pulling back  with an embarrassed face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What did she say?” Fate pondered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, she needs a bra.” Nanoha answered simply, making Caro flail out. “Lutecia-chan, do you need one too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I...suppose...?” She looked a little embarrassed as well. “I've never worn one before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To the lingerie store!” Nanoha took Caro's hand and lead her away happily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio rubbed his nose, face glowing red while waiting outside of the store. '<em>Don't think bad thoughts, don't think bad thoughts, don't think bad thoughts!</em>'</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's  been a while since we shopped together like this,” Fate mused while  holding up a black bra with purple flowers and contemplated buying it.  “Not just going out for food or supplies or something, I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm.”  Nanoha watched the sales clerk measure around Lutecia before going over  to Caro. “For now on let's do something every Firesday, even if it's  just going to lunch.” Turning to look back at her, she stuck out her  tongue. “Or we could go to <em>that</em> store sometime again too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate held her nose. “Don't bring that place up so randomly!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nyahaha!”  She turned back to the little girls and leaned over. “What sizes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A!” Caro replied happily. “Just like you, mommy!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With a small laugh, Fate looked down at Lutecia, who seemed a little surprised. “How about you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“B-cup,” She told her, making Nanoha suddenly go stiff. “...Did I say something bad?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">'<em>Taking our body proportion into consideration...She... has bigger breasts than me...</em>' The pony tailed woman sighed out dejectedly. “Life isn't fair...”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“This  is nice,” Nanoha spoke softly over the light bird's chirping and other  miscellaneous forest sounds. “We havn't done this in ages.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  couldn't help but give her a light chuckle. “Wash each other in the  holographic shower? Mm, I guess you're right, we havn't bathed together  in a long time.” Her eyes fluttered closed at the gentle rubbing from  her partner. “And you have been slacking on rubbing my back lately too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't  get mad when I put you to sleep of the middle of the day then.” Nanoha  shifted so she was sitting on her knees when her legs started to go to  go numb from sitting crossed legged for so long.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, about our wedding? Want to start planning it tomorrow?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm. With you in a tuxedo.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What <em>is</em> it with you and wanting me to cross-dress? You would make a better guy,  miss no-boobs.” She placed her hands flat against Nanoha's chest, or  lack there-of.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou, but that's why I like it” Nanoha stuck out  her tongue. “A hot male version of Fate, but with big boobs.” She  leaned forward and gave her a quick playful kiss. “Best of both worlds.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pervert.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Am not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's okay, I love that part about you too. You normally do it just to make me laugh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha pouted at her. “Busted. But it works, so it's okay right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  moves so she could start washing Nanoha instead now. “It's really  adorable. I love it when you crawl on the bed and make those meowing  sounds whenever I'm upset about work or stressed out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And then  lick your face until you pay attention to me?” Nanoha giggled. “That's  so much fun.” The two looked at each other a while longer before  laughing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're a silly girl,” The blond motioned for her to  turn around and gasped softly when she shifted her friend's hair.  “Nanoha, what happened to your back?” She trailed her finger along one  of the many small scars that hadn't been there last time she looked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”  She looked over her shoulder, suddenly remembering what Shamal told  her. “Oh... I forgot all about it.” The girl turned to look up at Fate.  “I happened when we were fighting. My back got hit really bad remember?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh yeah... You were protecting me.” Fate leaned forward and gave her back a small kiss. “Does it still hurt?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not at all,” She shook her head. “Does it...Look bad?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  you can't even tell really,” She slowly started to rub the soapy  washrag over her skin. “I think they add to your charm. Without these  scars, I would probably have really died then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anyway,  on to happy things,” She continued washing her friend. “You and your  meowing, and me and my complete lack of restraint to your teasings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We make such an odd couple.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,”  Fate stood and helped Nanoha to her feet before cutting off the shower  spray and killing the illusion around them. “You're really messy,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you're O.C.D about cleaning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate got a towel and began drying Nanoha off instead of herself. “You are lazy with your clothes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  you do laundry every two days.” Nanoha happily allowed Fate to dry her  off, smiling brightly at the attention she was given.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You never wear your glasses.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You eat cookies in bed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I do the sheets every week! Sometimes more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only  because we had sex on them.” Nanoha stuck out her tongue a moment  before Fate dabbed it with the towel and making her suck it back in.  “Ew! Towel fuzz in my mouth!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Serves you right, that's rude.” The blond stuck her own tongue out regardless of what she just said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well  at least I don't bite my nails.” Reaching for another towel, she  started drying off Fate now. “And then you try and kiss me, that's  gross!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well <em>you</em> kiss me after you...” Her voice trailed off, face red.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“After I whaaaat?” Nanoha cooed, knowing perfectly well what she meant. “You purr.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do <em>not</em> purr.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Growl,  moan, gasp, purr, same thing.” She touched her girlfriend's nose with a  finger before she could reply. “Which, I absolutely love, by the way.”  The blush she was looking for came, making her grin happily. “Watch  this.” Reaching down, she scooped the girl up into her arms and held  her. Fate squeaked in surprise, quickly looping her arms around  Nanoha's shoulders to keep herself steady. “I will now carry you to bed  like a princess.” She walked out of the bathroom door and did just  that, grinning when Fate shivered slightly when her still damp body was  hit by the coolness of their bedroom.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I thought I was supposed to be the prince?” She pondered, swaying her legs cutely as she was carried. “Not that I mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  change is good every now and then.” Gently laying her on the bed, she  smiled and crawled on top of her. “Mind if we cuddle while sleeping  tonight?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not at all. You love it anyway... Snuggle slut”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha broke into laughter at the pet name. “I am <em>not</em> a snuggle slut!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are so,” She accused. “But it's okay. Come here, you.” Reaching up, she pulled Nanoha down to lay on her. “I love you anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Somehow.”  She closed her eyes and rested. “I guess this officially closes the  book on Scaglietti... I wonder where we're going to go now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Preferably  somewhere leading to raising a family,” the red eyed girl thought  aloud. “Not that I want to retire or anything, but you know, We're  about to be twenty soon.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Most people don't start thinking about  family for another few years.” Nanoha corrected her. “But we're special  I guess... Okay, sure.” Looking down, she smiled at the girl. “Let's  get married and adopt Caro-chan when we're both twenty. From there  we'll see how Lutecia-chan goes and if we decide to in a few years  we'll adopt her too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe have a child ourselves?” She looked up into Nanoha's eyes. “I want to have a baby by you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate...Wow, really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm.”  Bringing her down lightly, she gave her lover a slow kiss. “We can have  our genes split and artificially fertilize me with it, it's really  safe.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...So it would really be my child?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In every way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha's lips turned up before giggling happily. “Wow, I'd be a <em>real</em> mother! But wait, there's so much to do! We're still young and our jobs, and and.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!” Fate laughed at her. “Years honey, years. At <em>least</em> six or so!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh!” She blushed darkly. “Oh.. yeah...I knew that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really!” Nanoha kissed her to prevent any protest from coming.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, okay,” Fate gave in to her before letting out a yawn and hugging her. “You ready to tuck in for the night?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey...before we go to sleep, can I ask something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?” The blond tilted her head to the side curiously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Will you... make love to me tonight? Gently?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate felt her cheeks color at the honest question. “I'll make love <em>with</em> you,” She replied softly, her hands going up and cupping the girl's  face to share a kiss before slowly moving to massage her neck. “I'm  glad you're with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm glad too,” She softly told her before  kissing more and trailing to Fate's ear and sucking on the lobe  carefully. She felt Fate's hands rub her back sensually, trailing over  her body. “We will always be together...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Always.”</span></p>

Thus  ends the second book of 6th Division, Reminisce. I want to give a  special thanks to everyone who stayed with my during this, and a very  special thank you to everyone who was with me during my first book as  well as this one. I hope all of you enjoyed this long fanfic and please  forgive the many spelling and grammar mistakes along the way. I'll go  back and correct them as soon as I get over being lazy about  re-uploading chapters. Please feel free to drop a review or email if  you want to talk about anything in this. I also hang out at the  shoujo-ai forums, as well as the ones at AnimeSuki. By now I'm sure  you've noticed that this isn't the last chapter, and the reason being  is the next one is an alternate ending. Although this is the official  ending, the one in the next chapter was the original ending. Just like  before, I will give a for fun refinance here to the many things that  influenced sections of this story. I'm leaving out all the ones from  “Rebirth” since you already know them.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Some people may notice this is  different from the chapter seven posted before this one. I revised it  and re-wrote most of it because some people felt the last version was  lacking. I hope you enjoyed this new version.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I thought about some of the parts in this chapter but after doing a little research, they are really quite logical.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">People  walking around while in shock actually happens a bit, so I've seen. My  friend's mother died and this was exactly what he did, walking around  on auto pilot while talking to people and setting up the funeral and  things, but you could tell he wasn't really all there and at times he  just stared into space. I know some people may not like it compared to  Nanoha, but this is what I can see honestly happening (as I have seen  it really happen). Just because you're in a state of shock doesn't mean  you can't walk around and continue to do things.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The part with  Vita waking her up may make some people doubt, as I've seen &quot;Only Fate  should wake her up&quot; before I wrote this, but I have to say... That's  fairy tale thinking, being in a state where only the love of your life  can snap you out of... Vita, being Nanoha's close friend, is the only  one I saw who could spell it out and brake it in on Nanoha that Fate  wouldn't want her to be a 'doll' and morn for her so much. &quot;Tough Love&quot;  as it's called. Sometimes you don't need people hugging you and telling  you &quot;It's okay&quot; because sometimes it's NOT okay. Nanoha needed to  realize this, and Vita just so happen to be the one to tell her. As for  her reaction of just crying and not going on a rampage: Nanoha has  never shown us that she would go psycho on people (even tho the 4koma  comics and fan pictures and things imply otherwise). Even when she's so  angry she can't see straight or so disappointed in her students she  feels the need to &quot;cool their heads&quot;, she was always calm and more or  less collected. She never raised her hand against anyone ( with a  purpose to hurt with her anger) or brake things in a rage. She is just  calm, so her character to me, would just break apart and not get  destructive.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As for Fate just suddenly getting her memories back,  that actually really does happen. Yes, just like that. Not always that  simple but when I looked into cases to do research for this, a lot of  people just -snap- remembered everything. Strange but true.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One  minute seven seconds,” Vita informed him, making Kuhn groan and hunch  over, dejected. “and you missed a triple sec in the long island.” </span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-Kuhn's  “6 drinks in under 60 seconds” is an actual round of professional bar  tending competition. Bar tenders must make six pre-selected drinks as  fast , and accurately, as they can. Judges do acute measuring of the  finished drinks and can tell if they're even one quarter of an ounce  low or too full. They are given penalty time for any mis-pours, spills,  or missing ingredients. If they are perfect, they get four seconds  removed from their time. Kuhn here isn't perfect, but he's still pretty  darn fast.</span></p>

“<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Being  emo,” Subaru yawned as she pulled one ear bud from her ear so she could  pay more attention to her partner. A song from Linkin Park was  currently playing, being set on Tia's personal play list.</span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-Linkin  Park, the band everyone says to listen to when you're having an emo  moment. I admit I had their latest CD “Minutes to Midnight” on repeat  while I wrote chapter 6 of Rebirth. And yes, even on Midchilda, there  is Linkin Park.</span></p>

“<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Um,  hello,” She greeted the man across the room. Several machines were  about, most of which she noticed were for standard hospital use. “I was  told by Dr. Light to come see you to get my device back?”</span></em>

“<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yes.”  They flew upwards slowly and touched the hatch, letting it open up in  two parts, sliding away. “Go in fast and together.” She got a nod and  the two hugged each other, flying up as quickly as they could. Just as  the blond predicted, the hatch slammed shut and locked, hissing out.</span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-Keeping  with the Mega man references (Wily being Skeith's creator), Jail's last  line of defense to his lair is a trap door at the top of a long  vertical hallway. This is what Sigma uses as his last defense against  Maverick Hunters.</span></p>
