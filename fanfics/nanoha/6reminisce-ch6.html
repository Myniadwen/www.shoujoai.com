<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was really  thankful when everything was settled down enough so I could finally do  something besides attend meetings with people I didn't even know. The  past three days were horrible, being mostly a blur of shaking hands,  re-telling my story countless times, and defending Lutecia's actions in  front of a court room. Thankfully Fate was with me most of the time and  even went on stand once when Lutecia was being pressured with questions  she couldn't answer. My sister calmed her down as best she could before  asking her own questions gently to her. When done she went with the  jury and used her influence to sway them over to her side. Being a  criminal at first herself, it was easy for her to convince them that  the summoner was more of a hostage situation than her willingly  attacking and stealing. The answer was given today, and Hayate was  charged with the responsibility of the girl. I was thrilled to hear  that, as I knew Hayate was a very caring girl. Although I didn't  interact with her much directly she still went out of her way and  proposed Lutecia with an offer she couldn't refuse: Help us in the Jail  Scaglietti mission and her record would be wiped clean. After that she  was free to leave, but if she wanted to, she could stay and be a  forward in section six. The look on her face was priceless and I  couldn't be happier than I was right now. I had probably changed the  girl's life for good, giving her a new opportunity. Now if only I could  figure out why my Princess is being so shy around me I would be  completely settled back in.</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay  that's enough for today.” Vita told the group, who all instantly  saluted her. “Dismissed.” To her surprise Subaru and Tia scrambled off  quickly to the other side of the training field, where Fate and Nanoha  were currently fighting. “Oi... if you have enough energy to run I'm  obviously not training you hard enough.” She growled lightly to  herself. “Anyway, Elio, you did rather well for not going through  training for the past month. Did you do anything there?” She already  knew he was treated well from the debriefings she had but was still  curious about what he actually did there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was locked in a room  for most of the time, but Lutecia took me to the work out section a lot  so I trained myself physically since my magic was locked.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro  looked over at him and dropped her gaze to his chest, where his shirt  was clinging to him from the sweat. “Well,” She heard Vita continue.  “It appears you shaped up a little. Caro apparently enjoys the new  sight.” After hearing her name Caro gasped and tore her eyes away,  blushing darkly. “Anyway, welcome back. We missed you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma'am!”  Elio saluted her crisply before she walked over to go observe her  friends in their mock battle. “So,” He turned to look at Caro. “We  havn't even been able to talk yet... How are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“F-fine!” Her  hands clasped together in front of her, rubbing over themselves  nervously. Tia and Subaru both told her that her new feelings were  probably a crush on the boy, come to her realization only after not  having him nearby for so long. “How are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Great!” The boy  looked around and took a long intake of air. “You have no idea how much  I missed everything. Just simply running in the morning and being able  to walk around... It's fantastic.” He looked over at her and realized  for the first time he had grown a little bit since they had first met.  “Hey, when did you get shorter?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn't get shorter!” She  protested. “You got taller!” Caro blinked, realizing that it was true.  “...When was it that I looked up at you?” the girl pondered a moment.  “I never thought about it since we always stood next to each other.”  True, her eyesight was now level with his nose. It wasn't much but  still made her happy. “My knight is growing up nicely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You'll still call me that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only if you want me to?” She looked away. “If you'd rather me not, I'll understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why wouldn't I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I saw you... you had Lutecia-chan's armor on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  was an emergency.” reaching out, he put a hand on her shoulder.  “Princess... I made an oath to Freidliche to protect you in exchange  for the armor... but the reason I made it in the first place was  because I wanted to. I'll say it again: I will protect you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro  smiled. “Thank you.” Reaching out, she took his hand and walked with  him over to the main base to meet up with her friend. “Lutecia-chan!”  She waved with her free hand. “You're able to walk around freely?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  have a device on,” she showed her wrist that now had a rather nice  looking watch on it. “I can't leave the base yet, but I'm able to go  anywhere on it.” When the two got close enough she reached out for  Elio's other hand, but paused before taking it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Go ahead,” Caro smiled at her. “I won't give up, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you; neither will I.” Lutecia took the hand and gave Elio a soft look.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The red head blinked, but allowed himself to be lead off by the two girls. “I... don't really get it...Give up at what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Both  girls looked back at him and laughed. “Nothing,” They both said at the  same time, pulling him more and making him stumble to catch up.”So,”  Caro began, “You're going to be stationed in my room while you're here,  Lutecia-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">On the training field still, Nanoha grunted out  when Fate appeared out of no where and slashed her scythe down at her.  Bringing up her own, she blocked the attack and stumbled to keep up  with the following slashes. The girl's cape flared out around her as  she twisted, trying to gain distance again but not being able to.  Another few strokes and she found herself pushed against a tree with  the pulsating blade of Bardiche itching her neck. “Yeild?” Fate asked,  slight amusement in her voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If Yield means the same thing as  'shoot' then yes,” Nanoha nodded down, revealing that in the last  flurry she had phase shifted back into her normal form and had a  charged attack at the tip of Raising Heart and pointed at her stomach.  “Call it a draw?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You cheated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did not!” Nanoha flailed out her arms and went still when Fate pressed Bardiche closer to her. “H-hey!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now I <em>do</em> win!” Fate called out triumphantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“... <em>Cheater!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Girls,” Yuuno sighed out. “The point isn't to see who would win.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“True,” Fate pulled her weapon back and leaned forward, kissing Nanoha's neck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno  rolled his eyes. “Anyway, Nanoha, your Phase Shift thing that you do.  You seem to be able to do it without loading a cartridge now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,”  Nanoha stretched out to ease her muscles after the intense spar she  just had with Fate. “After I finished my training, they observed me  when I did it to see if they could teach other people how to do it as  well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate blinked. “How'd that go?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Horrible. They  couldn't even start to understand how it worked. I can't do the attack  Skeith did to drain the information to fuel the change. They did,  however, tell me how my magic worked when I shifted, so I got a  training exercise there and they got me to a point where I can shift  without even trying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The male brought his hand to his chin and  rubbed it in thought. “You can copy their barrier jacket, weapon, and  skills, but not their talent or power.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So that is when our arc sabers hit each other's, mine ripped through yours so easily...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The brown haired girl whined out. “What do you want from me? I can barely use the scythe, let alone your <em>magic</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That's  why we're training you,” Fate put one of her hands on Nanoha's  shoulder. “Don't worry, we'll make sure that you are able to use it to  it's full power.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Speaking of full power... Have we been able to find Scaglietti's base yet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That's  what I wanted to talk to you about,” Yuuno waved out his hands and  canceled the simulation. “I have...” His eyes glanced over to Subaru  and Tia. “Let's talk about this over lunch okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why can't we know!?” Subaru instantly asked before Tia put her hand out in front of her. “Tia!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Permission to be briefed?” The gunslinger spoke instead, meeting Fate's eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm sorry,” Fate shook her head. “The only people involved in this mission are Nanoha and myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What!?” Subaru skated forward around Tia's arm. “Nanoha-san!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just as she said,” Nanoha stood her ground. “When we get the information, only Fate and I will embark on this mission.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“WHY!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That's  why!” Nanoha shouted back at Subaru as she walked over to her. “You  don't talk to your superiors like that, Subaru!” the blue haired girl  instantly looked hurt. “Subaru, you are a good girl, a great girl with  a kind heart... but you have yet to cross that line. I can't tell you  exactly where that line is, or how to do it, but you're still too  innocent. I know you're serious about your job, Vita-chan tells me all  the time that you are her favorite pupil... But... You still havn't  found your switch yet. I am your friend, and I'm glad, but there are  times where you must put that behind you and salute. Just as if Fate  would give me an order. I would click my heels, stand up straight,  salute her, and do exactly as I was told because she's an enforcer and  I'm an instructor.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru looked up at her, eyes confused. “I... I don't' think I understand?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  blond girl walked over to them and put her hands on Subaru's shoulders.  “Subaru, what happened right after the forest battle?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I... threw up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And when the confirmed kills came and you heard your number?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...I threw up again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  smiled at her softly. “I didn't. I don't want you to be that hard just  yet. You havn't crossed the breaking point of separating war from life,  work from fun. Scaglietti has office assistance, and probably two to  three hundred staff working under him at his real base. Drones don't  think for themselves, Subaru. When we go, we are going for one reason:  To kill.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha nodded. “Can you honestly hold your glove to  someone's throat while they're holding a gun to your stomach and crush  it before you die?” The young girl turned and looked away. “War isn't  pretty, and trust me, I don't like doing it. But we are going to save  countless people's lives by doing this, and if we stop the main person  trying to create and control life, we will also stop one of the  cruelest human experimentation known to our kind. Because of this, I  can fight and kill if I have to. When it is over, I will swallow it  down and forget it ever happened so I can go on living a happy life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  understand.” Subaru looked up and brought her hand up to salute them.  “Please... Keep training me. One day, I want to be able to help.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  soldier.” Nanoha and Fate both saluted her back. “As for you, Tiana,”  Fate continued. “If something happens, we need you to be in charge of  the forwards in missions while Vita and Signum are out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes ma'am!” Tia saluted her solidly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno put his hands on the leader's shoulders. “Very well worded, you two.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“What  do we know?” Yuuno leaned over Hayate and looked at her screen.  Reaching out, her started typing one handed to bring up a few monitors  for his friends and to also dim the lights. Hayate stayed silent, eying  the mass of Yuuno's ponytail that seemed to have fallen from his body  and landed on her shoulder. “...Hayate?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh!” She quickly began  typing. “Sorry, I was lost in thought for a moment. Let's see... What  we have,” the monitors all showed the same picture now, a floating  fortress on a chunk of rock that seemed to be drifting in space. “From  the information given to us by Elio and Lutecia, this is the main base.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ugh,  memories relived...” Fate frowned. “What is it with psychotic people  and making fortresses in the middle of a dimensional tear?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you mean?” Hayate looked over at her friends. “This is the first one I've seen?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Someone we used to know did it as well,” Nanoha joined the conversation. “But that's in the past, can we get to this one?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not without a war ship.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I've  already contacted Chrono,” Yuuno stepped in before anyone could say  anything. “He has given us permission to use the Asura since it's still  under his command.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wouldn't it be easier just to shoot the canon at it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate  gave Fate a nervous look. “If we shot the arc inside a dimensional tear  then we could possibly create a black hole that would suck us all in  and possibly alter the orbit of neighboring planets and destroy an  entire solar system.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha whistled. “That's bad, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shoot first, ask questions later, the motto of the training force.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno-kun!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anyway,”  Hayate got serious again before they could argue. “The password Lutecia  gave us still works, so we can teleport you directly into the base...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The room went silent a moment before Fate took a few steps forward. “Why did you say it like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because... the field only has access for two entries with the password before it is changed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha gripped her fist. “He knows we're still alive, and he's taunting us again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There's more isn't there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate  looked down. “We can get you in, but we can't get you out. We would  have to send Yuuno or Shamal in as well to teleport you back from  there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What about Arf? She's technically part of me, would that still count as an entry into the field?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Familiars are still life forms, only two can go in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  what are our options?” Nanoha rubbed the bridge of her nose. “Obviously  Fate and I have to go, and neither one of us can use long range  teleportation, only battle warping.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually,” Yuuno chimed in. “Unlike a magical barrier, this field only prevents scanners, radars, and <em>teleporting in. </em>It's not meant to trap inside, so if you use cartridges to boost your power, you can get to the Asura from inside the field.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then why can't you just port us out from inside?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hellooooo,” Yuuno tapped Nanoha's head. “I <em>just</em> said it blocks scans. We can't get a fix on your location, but <em>you</em> can get a fix on <em>ours</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  nodded to herself. “You can't teleport something you don't know where  is. If we could, things would be a whole lot simpler.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The point,” Hayate got back on track. “Is this would be a suicide mission...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If we only need to boost our power to escape, I think we can do it. Right, Fate?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,”  She nodded to herself. “It's the same as a battle warp... picture where  you want to go and teleport using your magic. If we use our cartridges  then we can temporarily boost our distance...We can do it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  commander looked down sadly. “It's still... Two against an entire army.  Even if they are scientist, none of them will hesitate to kill you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What...” Nanoha walked over to her to see her monitor. “Is the success rate of this mission?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“From  all the other battles again him, this being on his home turf, him  knowing you're coming...I'd say... Two percent... Max.” The words were  so soft they could barely be heard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate closed her eyes. “How long do we have?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  male of the group gave Nanoha a hug when she walked over to him. “He  won't keep the invitation up for long...If we take this chance...we  need to leave for the Asura tonight.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Nanoha!”  Kuhn greeted the girl when she walked into the bar. “What's shaking hot  legs?” The girl walked up to him and saluted, making Kuhn instantly get  serious. “What is it?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm... going on a mission tonight. If I don't  come back in a few days...Will you give this to my family?” She sat an  envelope on the bar.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Video letter?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is it that dangerous?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There is a ninety eight percent chance we'll both die.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...I  promise.” He took the envelope and leaned over the bar to hug her. “But  I won't have to. You'll come back like always. When you do, I'll treat  you and your entire squad to an entire night.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you.” She hugged him back tightly. “I'll be looking forward to it.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Signum  looked up as Fate passed by in front of her. “I heard,” She spoke  softly, catching the blond's attention. “About the mission.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Signum...” Fate looked at her fully. “So you know that...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  better not die, Fate.” The pink haired girl pushed off the wall she was  leaning on and walked over to her. “I won't forgive my rival if she  makes a stupid mistake.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Okay...” Fate blushed darkly when she found herself being embraced. “S-Signum?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Be  careful,” She whispered into her hair. “I've never been more proud of  you, for everything you've done and gone through recently. I know  you'll come out of this alive, so don't disappoint me okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Yes.”  Looking up, her cheeks got redder when the older woman kissed her  forehead. “You havn't done that since I was fourteen.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Consider it a good luck charm then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate nodded happily. “Okay!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Is  it really that bad?” Caro asked softly as Nanoha unlocked a cabinet in  her apartment that the younger one had never seen before. “Everyone is  really tense.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't worry,” Nanoha spoke more to herself.  “Everything will be fine.” Reaching in, she pulled out automatic  cartridge reloads by the handful and started placing the clips in  special slots on her barrier jacket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru's eyes went wide  after the fifth clip was secured and held her breath when the girl  didn't stop there, grabbing different types of gun devices and clicking  them around her. “Nanoha-san... You know how to use all those?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,”  Her voice was still distant. “I can teach anyone anything... Using  these is no problem. If I put too much stress on Raising Heart, it  won't be good for her so I keep these in case I need them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia looked away and gripped her fist tightly. “Is there... nothing we can do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Smile.”  Nanoha moved to the other side and removed several magnum clips and  tossing them to Fate. Finally she reached up at the very top and opened  a small box marked 'SSS+' and removed the single magnum bullet and  automatic cartridge. Raising Heart was shifted to reveal the single  emergency load bay and she slid the bullet into it, twisting the staff  back around and jamming her full clip into it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mommy... You'll come back won't you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  stopped moving, taking a small moment to reflect on the question. “Of  course,” She replied shortly. “Don't say silly things, this is easy for  me!” Kneeling down she gave the girl a tight hug. “Mommy will be back  tomorrow morning in time for breakfast. I promise.” Looking across the  room, she saw Fate holding Elio tightly against her body. “So just wait  for us... We'll come back.” She felt Subaru kneel down as well and wrap  Nanoha in a hug also.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't know,” The blue haired girl began,  whispering into Nanoha's ear so Caro wouldn't hear it. “The details  but... You honestly have all my faith.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you, Subaru.” Nanoha closed her eyes tightly to prevent a tear from escaping. “Thank you.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Are you ready?” Yuuno asked as the girls stood on the transporting section along with him and Hayate.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!” A new voice screamed, making them all turn to see Vita running as fast as she could over to them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Vita-chan!” Nanoha stepped forward to meet her. “You are supposed to be on the other side of the planet right now!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  small girl panted heavily, sweat drenching her clothes. “I found out,”  She manged between gasp. “I came... as fast as... I could...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha smiled down at her. “Thank you, Vita-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vita  looked up at her, eyes already moist. “I know everything, so...” She  wiper her eyes furiously. “I'll save everything until you get back, you  hear me? So...so.. come back!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I will,” The girl looked happy to hear that from Vita. “I promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Aren't you going to do it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know what!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you don't like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vita glared up at her. “You know I do!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you always say...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pet  my head, or I'll hit you!” Vita yelled up at her, instantly getting  Nanoha's palm on the top of her. Her hair was ruffled a moment before  Nanoha leaned over and kissed her forehead.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'll let you yell at  me later,” Nanoha whispered to her before standing and walking back  over to the group. “I'm ready, I've taken care of the last thing I  wanted to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then let's go.” Yuuno saluted everyone standing  around and allowed the girls to see their friends a little while longer  before spreading out his hands and teleporting them all away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  Nanoha could see again she was on the bridge of a very familiar  warship. Chrono stood several paces away from her in his full admiral  gear. “Welcome,” He saluted the group. “To the Asura.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Admiral,” Nanoha saluted him. “Thank you for your kindness in letting us borrow the ship.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The group looked at each other before the older man simply smiled at them. “This brings back memories.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  does, oni-chan.” The group walked over to him and Fate gave the man a  hug. “When this is over, let's talk about some of them, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.” Chrono nodded. “Are you two fully prepared?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” Nanoha nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A.A.M.F?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Five each,” Fate agreed. “One on each wrist, ankle and a necklace.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Cartridges, weapons?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Check and double check.” Nanoha nodded at him. “Raising Heart is packed to the brim.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bardiche is ready and steady.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I want to delay this as much as possible but there's a chance that Scaglietti knows we're here...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  seemed to understand. “Okay, I don't want to risk the lives of everyone  here. We'll leave immediately.” To her surprise Chrono grabbed her into  a hug. “Thank you. We'll be fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're going against an army,” He whispered. “Please, let me find another way to-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We can't,” She replied just as softly. “Two soldiers can do more damage than a battalion sometimes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're my sister, not just a soldier.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know,” Slowly she pulled away from him and kissed his cheek. “And as a  person I want to do this to save the lives of countless people who  would perish in a full scale attack.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You've grown up so much. I'm proud.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm proud too,” A new voice spoke up, making Fate turn.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mom!?” Quickly she ran over to Lindy and gave her a fierce hug. “It's been ages!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know, I'm so sorry.” Lindy gripped her more. “I'm thinking of moving  back to Midchilda soon, so you have to help me pack okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes!” Fate gave her another squeeze before pulling back and seeing her familiar as well. “ARF!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The small child leapt into her arms and clung to the woman. “Fate, I've missed you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  missed you too!” She gave the girl another hug before setting her down.  “I'm glad you came, I feel so much better now that I've seen you again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate, be careful in there okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course.” The blond stood up fully. “Nanoha, let's go. I want to get  back as soon as I can so I can spend some time with everyone okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds  tasty.” The White Devil formed her staff and began to walk to the  teleport area, meeting everyone's eyes as she passed. “We'll be back in  a few hours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Terror of Death nodded at everyone, forming her  scythe as she passed. “Ah. So don't worry.” The girls looked at Yuuno  and met his eyes. Slowly the male turned and typed on the keyboard  before nodding at them and slowly pressing the confirm button. The next  moment, the girls were gone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate fell to her knees. “I could have very well just sent them to their death...”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate  instantly looked around the moment she felt herself phase back  together. As she had expected, several armed people were waiting on  them. Before they could register the intruders she dashed forward and  cleaved her scythe, flooring them. Three people remained on the other  side of the hallway but they too fell, this time by Nanoha's silent  magical bullets fired from a hand gun. Two people rounded a corner on  patrol but a quick reflex from Nanoha made them both fall down before  either could full recognize the girls as their targets. The blond  looked over at her partner and watched her sheath the shotgun type  device back onto her back. '<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The White Devil, master of multiple weapons,</span></em>' She recalled, a little pleased at the talent she had. “<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Can you hear me?</span></em>” Fate asked mentally as they ran down the hallway together.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Yes,</em>” Nanoha pressed her back against a wall. “<em>Do you think they know we're here?</em>” Carefully she peeked around the corner and shot two more armored soldiers patrolling the hallway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>If he can tell how many people teleport in, then he knows we're here.</em>”  Fate followed her, scanning the area with her eyes and waving her hand  out when she saw a man in a white coat walk pass the hallway in front  of them. A yellow dagger of magical energy formed at her command and  flew silently through the air, hitting the man with an electric shock  and making him pass out. “<em>Let's find out where Scaglietti is and take him down fast. I want to avoid killing as much as possible.</em>”  She felt her partner agree and together they turned another corner. In  front of them stood several armed men, holding different types of guns  pointed at them. Before even Fate could react to the situation, Nanoha  was already reaching into her cape. She pulled out a small ball of pink  energy and threw it towards the group. Her other hand grabbed Fate and  pulled her to the ground. A few blast of something shot over their  heads but it was cut off by a soft sound and a sudden blast of wind.  When Fate looked up again she saw the people laying on the ground, not  moving. “<em>What the hell was that!?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>A type of magical burst.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Are they</em>-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Yes.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  nodded at her and left it there, running over the people and down  another hallway before pulling back and this time grabbing Nanoha from  the blast of fire that blared out around them. The soldiers screamed  their position and kept shooting as they advanced. “Well,” Fate spoke  verbally. “They definitely know where we are now.” She looked down at  Bardiche and loaded a shell before jumping into the hallway. “Plasma  smasher!” With a slash, she sent the blade of her weapon flying at them  and smirked at their terrified expressions when their projectiles  bounced off her shield. The next moment an explosion shook the area and  the screams rang out as Nanoha rolled out next to her and shot several  times while Fate Guarded her with her barrier. “Its been ages since  we've been completely un-restricted. I almost forgot the power we have.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kind  of scary, isn't it?” She ran again, slightly behind Fate. “I felt those  bullets. Whatever they are using, it has the power of double A magic  blast. I'd hate to think what would happen if a standard mage came  here...” Shaking the thought off, they continued. “We are going to go  no where without a plan, what should we do?” Her eyes looked around a  moment before reaching into her cloak and running ahead of Fate. The  hallway split into a four way intersection and she stopped in the  middle of it. Both hands came from her cloak and dual guns were  produced, firing several different types of bullets into each  direction. By the time Fate caught up with her the invading people on  both sides were already on the ground. “Let's go,” Nanoha didn't look  back. The end of the hallway revealed an elevator. “Pick a floor, any  floor.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate turned around and watched their back, sending more  yellow flying daggers at people chasing them. “Hell if I know!?  Twenty-six!?” She heard Nanoha punch the panel and when the sound  chimed to announce the arrival of the transporter they both kept into  it. “Five dollars says this thing is booby trapped and we're going to  fall.” The two held their breath as the floors ticked off on the top of  the door. Nodding at each other, Fate kneeled down and held out her  hands, forming several layers of shields in front of them. Nanoha  braced herself by placing one foot against the wall behind her and  kneeling slightly. Raising Heart was called forward and shifted into  shooting mode before charging. The final floor dinged and the doors  opened. Bullets rained on them in masses, shattering the first three  layers of the shield no sooner than they started. Fate heard Nanoha  yell out her Divine buster and felt it rip over her head into the  hallway. Several screams rang out but were cut off within seconds and  the rest were drowned out by the explosion across the room. “Some are  still alive!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha and Fate dived out of the elevator and  rolled on the ground. The blue eyed girl loaded several cartridges into  her device and shot a barrage of seeking bullets, controlling them with  her fingers. Once they met their targets and the blast confirmed their  death she stood up. “We're on the right track, these have shields that  two shells barely broke through!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Che,” Fate growled but ran along side Nanoha anyway. “How many people can possibly be here!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  universe is a large place,” the other replied easily. “Rounding up  several hundred people on a single planet is child's play...When you  search countless civilizations, I'm sure you can scrounge up quite a  few nut-cases more than willing to help out.” When more people came  into her view she reached back behind herself and pulled her shotgun  type device, shooting it twice to no effect. “Damn it!” She felt Fate  grab her and pull to the side. The two hid behind a large pillar,  seeing chunks of it getting blasted off by the ranged weaponry they  were against. Concentrating again, Nanoha loaded three cartridges and  formed a large ball of energy before shaping it into a half-sphere.  “This will hold them off for ten seconds only.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's enough.”  Fate took it and concentrated, melding it to her own magic. After  taking a breath she turned around and flew forward with her scythe  reared back behind her. Her eyes went wide as the attacks fizzled out  on the shield and felt like she was moving in slow motion on her way  over to them. When she got close enough several shells fired out of her  device and she slashed. Turning around, she brought her device up and  quickly turned so she wouldn't see the man's face as he died. Spinning  once more, her device fired out more shells to break through the  shields put up. Once done she took a slow breath and allowed pink blast  of energy to fly around her, taking care of the one she missed.  “Bardiche, reload.” She heard her empty shells clatter on the floor and  slammed another set into it. Nanoha reloaded her staff as well before  catching up to Fate. “You said ten seconds...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm sorry,” The  girl looked down at Fate's arm, frowning at the thick trail of blood.  “I had no idea they would be that strong...There has to be type of  boosting device in the building to prevent intruders.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  nodded and stood up. “Let's not stand still.” Once they were running  again, her eyes scanned the area. “We're constantly in an anti-magic  field. Our shields and projectiles are no longer part of our body so  they get weaker the farther they get from our A.A.M.F devices.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just great,” Nanoha growled. “I'm going to concentrate more on shielding us, can you handle the attacks?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Cover  me when you can, but make sure you're shielded before firing.” Fate  darted forward, flying while laying down only a few inches from the  floor. The people ahead of her turned and readied their weapons to  shoot but found themselves tripped up before having yellow daggers  thrust into them. The girl righted herself and stood in front of a  door. “Feel that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There is a mage behind that door.” Nanoha  nodded at Fate and brought out another one of her devices, blasting the  door several times and making it sail into the room quickly. The  twisted piece of metal clanged loudly as the two leapt through the  smoking area where the obstacle used to be.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Zest stood in the middle of the room, looking at them curiously. “The door wasn't locked.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  blushed darkly but Fate came to her rescue. “We don't have time to  worry with minor details.” She pointed her weapon at him. “Tell us  where Scaglietti is or we'll use force.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He's above us,” Zest  nodded upward and watched Nanoha look while Fate guarded her. “At the  top of the ceiling there is a hatch that can only open two ways. He is  behind there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How is it opened?” Nanoha looked back over at him  as Zest dropped into a fighting stance, throwing off his cloak to  reveal a muscular body. “I see.” Nanoha called forth Raising Heart and  pointed it at him as she circled the room. “<em>Fate, be careful. He's strong enough to subdue Freidliche and easily take on two B ranked mages.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Two ways?” Fate wondered aloud. “Assuming one is by you and the other is by Scaglietti?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“By  my death, or by Scaglietti,” He corrected her. “Before we begin, I have  a question for you, since I answered yours.” After getting a curt nod  from Fate he continued. “Is Lutecia safe?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She's fine,” Nanoha  informed honestly. “We're treating her like a little girl should be  treated and after we kill Scaglietti, her record will be clean and she  will be free to live out her life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see. Then I am pleased.”  Zest dropped into a fighting stance. “Although I'm afraid I can't let  you continue. You see, I need Scaglietti to stay alive so I can  continue to use him for my own purposes. I'm sure you want to end this  quickly so I'll go all out from the start.” The man took a short knife  from his boot and brought it up slowly, slicing his arm. Once the blood  started to flow he called it up and formed it into a ball of energy.  “As you may have guessed, this room is an exception to the anti magic  field that worries you girls so much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate gripped Bardiche  tightly, slowly leaning forward. Zest looked at her but moved his hand  out to his side so it was pointing at Nanoha. The blast fired and Fate  darted forward. Her scythe was grabbed by Zest's free hand and the  blood quickly formed into a ball of power, shooting her point blank and  sending her soaring across the large room and crashing into a wall.  Coughing, she fell forward and took a ragged intake of air. Small  chunks of the room fell around her and after glancing at the area  behind the girl, realized that she had almost gone through whatever  material it was. Her red eyes turned to scan for Nanoha and found her  still pushing herself up as well, crawling from a long trench her body  had just dug into the floor. “Bardiche,” She spoke quietly. “Let's  finish this quickly.” She was confirmed and four shells shot out of her  device. With a yell, the Terror of Death ran forward with her  broadsword Zamber. More blood was channeled but Bardiche loaded the  remaining cartridges and clashed against the force opposing him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  reached into her cloak and pulled out her last ball of compressed  energy, tossing it underhanded toward the pair. Fate read the move  exactly and countered her force to flip herself up into the air. Nanoha  pulled Raising Heart back and started charging her blast to prepare the  counter measure. Her small ball of magic caught Zest's attention as it  clattered to the floor by his feet. The shock wave ripped around them  as the ground caved, showing the floor beneath them that was also blown  away since the AMF wasn't active in the area. As expected Zest flew up  into the air to avoid the blunt of the attack, but instead of looking  more dead than alive he only seemed infuriated from the attack. All the  blood coming from his wounds channeled up in front of him as he came  closer towards Fate. “Shoot!” Nanoha screamed out, finally releasing  her attack.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate flicked Bardiche's chamber out and moved to slam  her reload in but some of Zest's attack still cut through Nanoha's  blast that separated them. With a loud crash, the blond hit the ground  and struggled to right herself while reaching into her cloak and  pulling out another reload to replace the one that was just lost.  Putting it in, she locked Bardiche back into place. The next moment she  found herself suddenly behind Nanoha and screaming as an attack unseen  ripped through her body. Falling forward, she allowed her partner to  catch her and panted out heavily; having just been blasted clear across  the room. “I forgot...” She whispered through the pain. “The more we  hurt a blood magic user...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The stronger they become...” Nanoha  finished for her, slowly laying Fate onto the ground. Before she could  turn around she felt the familiar itch on the back of her neck once  again. A shield was put up quickly but the attack still slammed into  her, forcing her to hunch over Fate to protect the girl from the attack.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!”  Fate caught her as she fell and gasped out at the burned red back  visible through the ripped barrier jacket. “You bastard!” She glared  over at the man who was weakly pushing himself up, bleeding drastically  from most of his body. “If this keeps on we won't even <em>face</em> Scaglietti, much less kill him...” Fate held out Bardiche and glared.  “Load full! Plasma Zamber Breaker!” She raised up her sword with one  hand shaking. “Full power!” With those words she let it fall forward,  blasting the energy into the man who brought up a glowing red shield.  “Bardiche...” She whispered, bringing her other arm around Nanoha and  holding the sword steady. “... Please!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes sir.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  felt herself push back into the wall by the new force, finally breaking  through the shield opposing her and ripping into the man's body. The  blast made the area around them explode and cave in, destroying several  floors and breaking out into space. “Emergency,” A female's voice came  through hidden speakers. “Area breech, deploying Foam.” As stated, what  appeared to be a type of foam sprayed through the areas and flew  towards the suction leading out into space before solidifying and  making a sickening splat sound when it hit the hole. Several layers  piled up and Fate's hair fell back down when the suction was lost. Once  done she dropped her sword and laid back weakly, leaving one hand over  Nanoha's waist as she rested against her still.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ow...” Nanoha finally spoke after a minute. “Is it over?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He's dead.” Fate told her weakly. “I used my SSS shell... If he survived that there would be no way to take him out...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  hate...” Nanoha slowly pulled off of Fate and sat down next to her.  “Blood mages...” Slowly she rotated her shoulder. “How are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exhausted,” Fate answered honestly. “We've been using so many cartridges... it's taking it's toll on our bodies.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.”  Nanoha panted. “Scaglietti knew we would...I bet you anything he set it  up so we would tire ourselves out on pointless skirmishes to lower our  guard when we fought a real opponent... And you know what? I bet the  elevator we were on would have taken us here no matter what number we  pushed in...and it worked. Dammit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate looked up at the ceiling above them and to the hatch. “If we're this tired after the pre-battle...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha looked down. “We'll make it out. We'll steal a stupid shuttle if we have to. Take someone hostage and make them lead us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good  plan.” Fate stood up, ignoring the alarm still sounding from where she  blew up the immediate area. “What's your ammo situation, multi-weapon?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  hate that nickname, you know that.” Despite her protest she stood up as  well and started taking inventory. “I have...A full clip, three left  inside Raising Heart, my SSS+ shell, um, two shots left on my left  pistol, three on my right... and one blast left on my shotgun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No more grenade thingies?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They're distortion bombs, and no. How are you, Scythe Master?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  couldn't help but smile lightly at their own stupid nicknames for each  other. “Lessee...” Reaching into her pockets she pulled out a reload  and filled Bardiche. “I wasted an <em>entire</em> load like a moron...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You were protecting me...Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  grinned lightly. “Thank me when we're out of here... Son of a... I only  have three cartridges left, not counting what's in Bardiche.” Looking  up, she frowned. “What do you think our chances of beating him are?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh he's going to be beaten,” Nanoha assured her. “It's just a matter of us getting out alive when he blows this place up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He's going to self destruct the base when he loses.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why in the name of all that's good and holy would he have rigged his <em>entire</em> base with explosives to detonate when he dies?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because that's what mad scientist do?” She offered weakly, getting a sigh. “I'm telling you, he's going to self destruct!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha,  I love you, but that is completely illogical. Stop reading those stupid  science fiction books.” Fate looked over her fiancée to inspect her  back. “Does this hurt?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, very badly.” Nanoha smiled over at her. “Feels like I decided to iron my shirt with it still on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” Fate leaned over and kissed the base of her neck. “I would have died if not for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,  what can I say?” The two smiled at each other before suddenly losing  their false happiness. “We should get this over with, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”  They flew upwards slowly and touched the hatch, letting it open up in  two parts, sliding away. “Go in fast and together.” She got a nod and  the two hugged each other, flying up as quickly as they could. Just as  the blond predicted, the hatch slammed shut and locked, hissing out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  well, well...” a voice came up as the girls inspected the room they  were in. “I was wondering how long it would take you to get here. I  must say, I'm impressed. You didn't use nearly as many cartridges as I  thought you would. Tell me, did the book worm counter my AMF device?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Gee I wonder?” Fate snipped at Jail Scaglietti, igniting Bardiche. “No, of course not! Whatever gave you <em>that</em> idea?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Jail  gave her an amused smirk before stumbling backwards when a large blast  of energy shot into his face. The next moment he glared and knocked  Nanoha's shotgun away when it was thrown at him. Once the item was out  of his way he saw Nanoha in front of him, slashing her sword down where  he was just standing. Using his arm he blocked her countless times  before gripping the created blade and closing his fist, snapping it.  Not one to give up, Nanoha simply twirled around, changing her form to  match Fate's and slashing her new scythe out. The move worked and Jail  lunged backwards, looking at his cut shirt. “Now that wasn't very  nice,” He mused playfully. Fate snarled, running at the man and  slinging her scythe, shooting out two shells as she did so. Jail's face  set, glaring at her but only managing to slow her movements a little  and not bind her like he had done before. Taken off guard, he turned to  the side and leapt back, moving his hands up and concentrating harder.  The blond lifted into the air and flew across the room, crashing  against a desk. “You think you can win?” He laughed out again, grabbing  Nanoha's scythe and turning around, slinging her into the opposite  wall. “I havn't been sitting here doing nothing, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Walking  down to the center of the large circular room, he looked at his  opponents. “You see girls,” He continued. “I have finally managed to  get a hold of a few things. I do believe you know what they are; Jewel  Seeds as you called them.” Taking off his lab coat he revealed that the  skin color of both his arms didn't match that of his body. Around his  shoulders, a few blue gems were embedded into his skin as if they were  joining the arms onto him. “It was quite painful, but I managed to be  able to harness their power and convert it to my telekineses. I lost my  other arm in the process, but having already rebuilt one before, it was  simple to do it again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have I ever told you...” Fate picked  herself up and loaded a cartridge just to restore some of her magical  power. “That you're a sick individual?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'll take that as a compliment,” He looked over at Nanoha, who was suddenly hunched over. “Are you done already?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Jewel...Seeds...” Her breathing picked up, shoulders heaving. “You...Created... More... <em>Jewel Seeds</em>!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Jail looked at her with an amused smirk. “Why yes I did, five to be exact.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  yelled out and ran forward, loading another two shells to re-form her  Zamber saber. Slashing down, her heart stopped beating for a moment  when the man simply caught the blade in between his hands. “...  Impossible...” Jail slung her against the wall with another mental  blast before tossing Bardiche across the room. “To be honest, I have  let you two survive up until now for one reason... To convert you both  into Seeds and use your power to better myself! The ultimate fusion of  technology and magic!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You...You...” Nanoha stood up, a light  black mist coming from her clothing. “Just for your own gain...”  Looking up, she blurred over to him and punched his stomach before he  could react. Her other fist reared back and slung at his head, but only  cut through air. Jail appeared behind her, grabbing her wrist and  brining it behind her back. “Aggghnn!” She bit back her yell as her  shoulder popped loudly out of joint. Forcing herself to stay perfectly  still, she closed her eyes and trusted her gut feeling. Seconds later  Jail leapt backwards when several yellow energy daggers embedded the  area around them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate appeared next to her seconds later. “You  okay?” She looked at Nanoha's shoulder and frowned. “Dislocated?” This  time Nanoha nodded and let Fate touch her a moment before gripping her  and sharply popping it back in.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Son of a-!!!” Nanoha rubbed her shoulder ruefully but quickly gripped Raising heart again and loaded cartridges. “Accel shot!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Jail  held out his hands and curved the blast upwards, blasting a chunk of  the ceiling out but leaving him unhurt. “You are only delaying the  inevitable,” He taunted before having a small melee fight with Fate. “I  like your new hair style,” He cooed, receiving a sharp punch to the  face but recovered by slamming his fist into her stomach before lifting  her into the air with his mind and slamming her back into the ground.  “Jewel Seed number Six...Fate Harlaown. Has a nice ring to it, don't  you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha's eyes dilated, heartbeat thundering in her ears. “<em>I will help you,</em>” A soft voice spoke deep within her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  man lifted Fate back into the air and looked at her weak body. “But it  would be a shame to waste such beauty. Perhaps I should just make you  my assistant...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Swallowing, Nanoha flexed the fingers on her  right hand. “Let her go...” She whispered out softly but knew Jail  still heard her. “Don't touch... my fiancée..”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why is that?” He  asked her, punching Fate when she tried to call Bardiche to her hands.  “Once she's broken she'll be a wonderful slave. I'll even give her your  jewel seed and use her to fight for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You...” Nanoha closed her eyes, mist circling her body. “Will not... touch her...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  already am.” To prove his point he wrapped an arm around Fate's waist  and grinned at her weak attempt to struggle away from him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Call me! I will find you!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Unhand her!” Nanoha threw out her arm, the sound of a tuning fork echoing around her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I'll find you! Call me! Guide me to you!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Jail lifted up Fate's head and turned it to himself. “Come on...” Nanoha whispered. “Come on... Find me... <em>find me</em>!” She looked up slowly, eyes flecking yellow. Once she met his eyes he turned to Fate and smirked. “Come on...<em>come on!</em>”  The mist around her body started clinging to her, altering her barrier  jacket to deep black and yellow. “I'm...” Jail looked at her and  smirked, bringing his lips closer to Fate's. “Right...” He kissed her. “<em>HERE!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I have found you!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha's  eyes snapped open wide, glowing yellow. Black liquid flashed around her  body, forming a new jacket complete with gold spikes. Crawling up her  neck, the ooze covered her mouth and nose as two bat wings ripped from  her back. “Skeeeeeeiiiitttth!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Jail flew across the room,  slamming into the wall and continuing through it. After the shock he  looked forward to see a girl he's never seen before reach out and grab  his neck. Glaring, he sent a physic blast at her that she ignored as if  it never happened. With a small flick of her wrist he found himself  flying again, back through the wall he just came through and sliding on  the floor of his main office. “What is this!?” turning, he saw a blur  of black before he felt his back rip in pain. Quickly turning he saw  Skeith standing with blood on her hands, slowly bringing one up to her  mouth and licking it off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Taste like... fear.” She smiled at him  sickingly, darting forward and easily countering his mind blast.  “Scaglietti, I have waited years for this.” She smiled when his face  went pale and followed his eyes down to his stomach where her hands  were slowly cutting into his skin. “Try... Try and stop me...” She  walked forward, holding him in the air by his neck and pressing her  hand deeper into him. “Yes... That's right...I see it on your  face...Fear...” Licking her lips, she pressed him against the wall.  “Your sick games end here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!?” Fate coughed, forcing herself to stand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kind of,” She threw Jail onto the floor and watched him slide across it, leaving a trail of blood. “Are you okay, Fate-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Skeith...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” Walking over to her, she observed Fate's condition. “Are you hurt anywhere bad?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where is Nanoha!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Skeith  looked at her, a little hurt. “She's right here,” bringing one clawed  finger up, she tapped her head. “Guiding me. She woke me up, so I am  here to serve her.” Before she could get a response she suddenly fell  forward. The ball of energy that had hit her exploded, slinging both  girls away from each other. “Raising Heart!” She called the staff over  to her and concentrated.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, my master.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Grinning, she  loaded the shells in her clip and pointed, destroying the whitish haze  of physic energy tossed at her. Once clear, she removed the clip and  tossed it, twisting the staff around to the reserve section. “Load  Triple S!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your magic can not stop me!” Jail screamed at her, furious. “I'll kill you both and turn you into programs!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  am not a program,” Skeith growled as she clapped her hands together and  formed a ball of yellow energy, Raising Heart floating above her and  sending it's power into the blast. “I am a human being!” Once all of  her power was siphoned into the attack she ran forward and threw it.  Fate cried out as Jail launched his attack as well. The resounding  explosion made her roll across the ground several times before she  could grab a hold of Bardiche and bring it up, loading a cartridge to  form a shield around herself. When the area calmed down She opened her  eyes slowly, watching Skeith limp over to Jail's body and reach down to  pick him up. “You,” Skeith began, “Are finished, Scaglietti.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Weakly reaching up, he gripped Skeith's wrist. “What, are you going to kill me? Kill <em>me</em>!? The greatest mind ever!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Skeith  frowned at him, tightening her hold around his neck before letting him  drop to the ground. “No... You are under arrest. I don't want to kill  anyone again if I don't have to.” Turning, she walked over to Fate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Skeith! Behind!” Fate pointed at Jail, making the other girl turn around as fast as she could.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should have ended it!” Jail yelled at her, lunging forward with a ball of power in his hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You <em>fool</em>!”  Skeith flared her magic around herself, knocking his blast astray and  forming her own. With a glare she thrust it forward against his chest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I backed my self up,” Jail told her with a sick smile. “Someone will re-incarnate me, with the ultimate body! I <em>will</em> return!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When  you do,” Skeith told him, mask sinking back down her neck and revealing  slate blue eyes. Nanoha smirked as the blast started to expand. “Give  my regard to my daughter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate watched Nanoha fly back from the  force of her own attack, which destroyed most everything in front of  her. Acting quickly, she managed to leap in front of her and catch her  fiancée before she hit the ground. “Nanoha!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes...” She looked at the area in front of her, which was quickly being covered in the protective foam. “Is it over...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You blasted him out into space... Nothing can survive that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha fell against her weakly, barrier jacket reverting back into it's white self. “Thank you... Aura...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is... Is she okay too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sleeping...I used too much of her power...” Nanoha looked positively exhausted. “I... don't think I can move.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me either...” Fate chuckled to herself. “I need a few minutes...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  female voice came to their ears as red lights started flashing. “Self  destruct sequence activated. T-minus Two minutes until detonation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're <em>kidding me</em>!?” The blond screamed, looking around frantically. “ What kind of <em> sick minded</em>... UGH!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm out of cartridges...” Nanoha looked over at Fate, scared.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bardiche!” The barrel of the staff opened up, revealing a single shell. “... One left.” The two looked at each other slowly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can we... teleport with only one?” Her voice was soft, worried.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  licked her lips slowly, looking around as the area they were in started  shaking. “I...” A sudden explosion made them fall over onto the floor.  The woman's voice declared that there was only one minute left until  complete detonation. “Nanoha,” Fate looked down at her and smiled  softly. “Of course we can, can't we Bardiche?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes sir!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh thank Goodness...” Nanoha gave Fate a loving look. “When we get back, I'm going to cook you the <em>biggest</em> steak you've ever seen!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds  tasty.” Fate put one hand on Nanoha's shoulder as another explosion  shook them. “I just want to say, Nanoha, that I love you very much...  Just wanted to say that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love you too,” She smiled. “Let's  say it more once we're back on the Asura, I don't want to stay here any  longer than we have to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.” Fate closed her eyes.  “Bardiche, load cartridge!” She felt a tear roll down her cheek as her  magic circle appeared under her. “I love you, Nanoha. Always and  Forever.” She didn't have to look at her to feel Nanoha's sincere  smile. “Teleport!” A flash of light engulfed them momentarily but faded  just as fast as it was created. Fate slowly lowered her device and  opened her eyes, looking at the spot her lover just was. “I'm sorry for  making you lie, Bardiche.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate felt the  tears come to her eyes. The floor gave out from underneath her, making  the girl shakily try to keep herself from falling too fast. The room  where they fought Zest was passed through and Fate found herself  falling through the hole in the floor where Nanoha's bomb blasted.  Finally she hit the ground and was shaken again by fire raining around  her as bombs detonated. “Nanoha... Live a great life...” Her body was  thrown to the side and onto the floor, where she pushed herself up and  looked around. “I love you... I love you...” The words made her smile.  “I love you, Nanoha.” Looking to the side, she saw something sparkle  brightly in the light of the fire before an explosion ripped around her.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha  gasped out when the cool air of the Asura washed over her. Instantly  everyone screamed her name and she couldn't help but laugh out happily.  “We did it! We did it Fate!” Turning to smile at her lover, she  suddenly paused. “Fate... Fate!?” The girl stood up, turning circles.  “Fate!? Where's Fate!? <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno where's Fate</span></em>!?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno looked at her a moment, trying to figure out what was going on. “Nanoha... Only one person teleported here...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No... No!!!” The girl ran to the screen in the middle of the bridge, looking at the fortress. “She didn't... <em>She didn't!</em>”  A bright flash flared around the fortress before shattering into  piecies, cutting off the visual from the blast. “Fate...? Fate...!? <em>Faaaate!!!</em>”</span></p>

Shamal:  Nanoha has been hospitalized ever since she came back. Not saying a  word to any of us, I treated her and patched her wounds. Her injuries  were not life threatening but her Linker Core was down to a size where  she wouldn't be able to use magic for a few days. Despite this,  something is wrong with her...
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate: Nanoha!? Nanoha why won't you answer us!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno: This isn't right... Nothing is wrong with her to make this happen... Why won't she react to anything!?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shamal: I've seen this before...Her body and Linker Core will be fine... but her heart, her soul...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chrono: What do you mean!?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shamal: She's... lost her desire to live.</span></p>
