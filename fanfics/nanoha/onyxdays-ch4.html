<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Waking up this morning  was rather peaceful. For once I didn’t feel like curling up into a  ball and going back to sleep but instead I found myself taking a deep  breath of air and stretching out. My stomach wasn’t bothering me  and I felt well rested to boot. Fate was curled up against me,  resting her head on my chest and lightly gripping my shirt with one  hand. The girl snored lightly but I always found it too cute to be  annoying. Currently she was breathing rather heavily, still being  stuffed up with her illness. I took a small moment to run my fingers  through her hair and smile down at the blond. It was weird how a  little bout of the flu could make us open up about our feelings  toward each other. I knew that I would always love her and be there  for her as well. Through anything, anytime, anywhere. I would  always…Wait a second, I smell something… Sniffing again, I  smiled. ‘<em>Score, Yuuno is baking muffins!</em>’ I slid out from  bed after setting my girlfriends head gently down and trotted down  the stairs to get some food.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Onyx  Days IV</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By:  Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Morning!” Yuuno  greeted his friend while sitting the pan of muffins on top of the  stove. “How are you feeling?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A hundred percent,”  Nanoha replied, looking over his shoulder at the fluffy treats. “Are  they ready to eat?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They need to cool.  No touching.” He grinned at her as he made his way back to the sink  to start cleaning up the mess he made earlier. “I said no touching,  Nanoha.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can’t even see  me!” She took her hand back in mid-reach.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t have to, I  know you better than you know yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so, you’re  even wearing my apron. You look great in pink, by the way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh that’s mean.”  Yuuno chuckled despite himself. “And after I take care of you for  three days, even running your classes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you very  much.” Nanoha hopped up to sit on the counter, watching him. “You  have to leave today?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Unfortunately Chrono  only gave me enough time off to make sure you two were okay.” He  got down a glass and filled it up with orange juice before handing it  to his friend. “Here you are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” She  gratefully drank half of it on the first go.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if you’re  feeling fine, remember that you could relapse if you stress yourself  too much. Fate’s still sick so don’t think for a moment you’re  in the clear yet. Stay in bed and drink lots of fluids okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes Mother,”  Nanoha smiled at him happily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And don’t forget  to wash behind your ears.” He poked her arm, getting swatted at.  “Here, muffin.” The boy handed her a small plate with the  strawberry muffin on it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning,”  Fate yawned as she walked into the kitchen hazily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan, should  you be up?” Nanoha quickly hopped down and walked over to her.  “Here, come sit down.” She lead her girlfriend to the barstools  and helped her up on one. “Can I get you anything? Don’t stress  yourself okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes Mother,” Fate  grinned at Nanoha but turned his attention to Yuuno when the boy  suddenly started laughing. “…What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing, nothing.”  He waved it off. “You two really are a couple.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You told him?”  Fate blushed lightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um…He knew a long  time ago I liked you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How long?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like two years,”  Yuuno snorted, amused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno-kun!” Nanoha  stomped her foot. “Don’t embarrass me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Two years? Wow.”  Fate leaned forward, idly munching on the muffin Yuuno plopped in  front of her. “I feel special.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should,” Yuuno  grinned. “She would always talk about you whenever we would go out  and do something.” He grabbed the girl’s hands when she tried to  bop him on the head. “And she would change into clothes and ask me  if I thought you would find her cute in them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno-kuuuuuunnn!”  She whined lightly. “You’re making me blush, don’t tell her  that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What else did she  do?” Fate pondered happily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well you know she  talks in her sleep right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All too well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do not!” Nanoha  stammered. “People need to stop saying that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well there was this  one time she stayed over at my place…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha gasped out,  obviously remembering that dream. “You tell her that and I’ll  make sure you’ll never have any little ferretlings!” Yuuno wisely  closed his mouth and grinned at her. “I can’t believe you.” The  girl crossed her arms. Fate watched the two life-long friends argue  with each other a moment longer before laying her head down on the  counter and yawning. “What are you plans for the day?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,” He took a  sip of coffee before continuing. “The people at the library tend to  slack off when I’m not around so I’m going to be heading back  right after today’s lesson.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw,” She pouted.  “But we haven’t even been able to have any fun together yet!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Playing scrabble at  two in the morning with sick girls who slept all day is a blast.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I still say you made  that word up. The one with all the X’s and Z’s.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh come on, you’re  just mad you lost.” He smiled as he finished his drink with the  last sip. “On that note, I should be heading out for the final  lesson before I turn them back over to you.” Yuuno took out Raising  Heart from under his shirt and slid off the necklace. “I won’t  have time to come back after the class so I’ll return this now.”  He put it around her neck. “All the data is stored under my name,  don’t forget to switch user mode or you’ll end up with the book  form.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha held back a  laugh. “Yuuno-kun, I’ve been with her for fourteen-some years, I  know how she works.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh yeah,” He  grinned sheepishly. “Sorry.” The boy reached down to the floor  and picked up a duffel bag. “Well then, I should be going. Thanks  for having me over, take care of yourself.” The two hugged each  other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank <em>you</em> for  taking care of us. Be good okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Always.” He looked  over at the blond. “Bye Fate, feel better all right?” He got a  sleepy murmur in response, making him smirk. “Tell her bye for me  again when she’s not so sleepy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Will do,” Nanoha  walked him to the door and gave another girlishly cute wave as he  walked down the hallway. Closing the door slowly, Nanoha’s lips  turned up into smile. “Now that the Ferret is gone…” The door  locked with an audible click, making Fate look up. “It’s time for  some fun…” She, for lack of a better word, strutted across the  floor towards Fate while unbuttoning her nightshirt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Na-Nanoha-chan!?”  Fate blushed darkly, slipping herself off the stool and walking over  to her. “What are you- ahh!” She gasped out when the girl grabbed  her shirt and ripped it open, tearing the buttons off the front in  the process. Quickly she was pushed backwards up onto the wall.  Nanoha’s body sandwiched her between the wall and herself as she  grabbed Fate’s butt and quickly pulled against her thighs, forcing  the legs out form under her. Instead of falling she found herself  pushed harder against the wall and allowed her legs to wrap around  Nanoha’s waist. “Wha, what are you doing?” She felt her friend  shift lightly and suddenly felt something pressing against her  stomach. Looking down nervously, she gasped out. “Oh my god, are  you wearing a strap-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes I am,” Nanoha  cooed at her seductively, licking her lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly the corners of  Fate’s mouth turned upwards as she wrapped her arms loosely around  Nanoha’s neck, resting them on top of her shoulders. “…Then  give it to me rough!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was planning on  it.” Nanoha kissed her harshly. “Fate-chan…Fate chan!” Her  hands squeezed her friend’s butt tightly, rocking her hips just a  little to tease the girl. “Fate-chan…. Wake up Fate-chan. Come  on, Wake up Fate-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate slowly opened her  eyes and looked at the half eaten muffin in front of her. Her gaze  turned to the side where she spotted Nanoha and Yuuno looking at her.  “Aw look,” The male laughed. “She doesn’t have a clue what’s  going on!” Slowly she pushed herself up and realized that she had  been resting against the bar.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh leave her alone,  she’s sick.” Nanoha giggled to herself before walking around the  bar and over to her. “Really, Fate-chan, you shouldn’t get out of  bed if you can’t even eat breakfast without falling asleep… Here,  you’re drooling.” She picked up a napkin and wiped her friend’s  mouth while she became more aware. “You had this really weird laugh  going on in your sleep, as if you were really enjoying something?”  She finished cleaning the saliva from her mouth. “Good dream?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ye-yeah…” She  blushed darkly as the pieces fit together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re all red…”  Nanoha put her hand on her friend’s forehead. “You seem to be a  little warm… You should get back in bed.” Taking a step forward  she got in-between her friend’s legs and pulled her onto herself in  a type of backwards piggyback ride. “I’ll carry you.” The  position quickly reminded Fate of her dream ten fold. “Ahh!  Yuuno-kun get some tissues quick; her nose is bleeding!”</span></p>

“You think it will be  all right to stop by again un-announced?” Caro asked lightly as she  rode the elevator up with her partner. “We’ve come by every day  since they were first put in bed…”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We won’t stay  long; I just want to make sure Fate-san is all right still.” Elio  looked over at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You really like her  don’t you?” She looked over and up at him to see him nod. The boy  had hit a growth spurt since he joined the squad a few months ago,  making him a good half-foot taller than her. All in all she rather  enjoyed him being so tall, as it made him look rather charming in her  eyes. Subaru and Tia had both gained an inch almost, the harsh  training forcing their bodies to adapt to it. Despite this, however,  she hadn’t grown any at all. ‘<em>At this rate I’ll only come up  to his chest when we’re both fully grown…</em>’ She sighed  softly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Something wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh? Um, no.” She  blushed lightly at the tone of voice he had with her; it was so much  softer than when he spoke with anyone else. The elevator doors opened  and the pair walked out, lightly brushing against each other. Caro  was never shy about touching him, after all the first time they met  his hands found themselves on her chest…or lack thereof. Lately  however she realized that when they weren’t on the battlefield, she  would find herself seeking him out. On breaks or at dinner she would  be next to him, sitting so their sides touched or with one hand on  his elbow while they walked. ‘<em>It’s almost like I have a crush  on him…</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio stopped walking a  few steps later when he realized that the hand on his elbow was  suddenly gone. He turned to look back, seeing Caro standing there  with a shocked look on her face. “…You okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-Yeah!” She  trotted up next to him again quickly, blushing. “Sorry…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No problem.” The  two began to walk again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Okay Caro, calm  down. So you have your first crush, he’s no different than he was  twenty seconds ago!’</em> The pep-talk calmed her down slightly and  she allowed herself to once again reach out to the boy, finding his  arm already there as if he were waiting on it. She pushed the com  button when they reached the door and only had to wait a few moments  before they got a cheerful response.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello,” Nanoha  greeted. “Who is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio,” The male  answered promptly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And Caro,” She  added in for him, finishing his sentence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come on in, it’s  unlocked.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two did as they  were asked and looked around, finding Nanoha cleaning the living room  while Fate laid on the couch, half asleep. “Are you well enough to  be cleaning?” Caro asked, looking a little worried.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, she’s not.”  Fate answered for her. “But she won’t listen to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hush, I’m fine.”  Nanoha scolded as she put down her rag and cleaning spray. “Hello  you two, make yourselves at home. Want anything to drink?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m all right,  thank you.” Elio instantly went over to Fate, who lifted her pillow  and allowed the boy to sit down before replacing the cushion on his  lap and using him as a prop. “How are you, sis?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Call me mom,” She  yawned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio blushed lightly,  looking over at Nanoha. “She’s doped on medication,” She  smiled. “Just ignore her.” She noticed that Caro was thinking  awfully hard about something so she lead the younger girl into the  kitchen to get her something to sip on. “Fate-chan originally  wanted to adopt Elio,” she explained while getting a glass down.  “But since she wasn’t old enough, or really able to properly do  it, Fate-chan’s mother is the official signed guardian, making Elio  Fate’s little brother.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Caro  smiled while accepting the glass of kool-aid. She took a small dink  and looked down into the colored liquid a moment before turning back  up towards Nanoha. “Ne, can I ask you something? Um, personal not  military?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure?” The older  girl watched Caro hop up onto the barstool so she leaned against the  bar from the kitchen side so they would be face to face. “What’s  on your mind?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well…” Her  cheeks colored a little. “How did you know when you had your first  crush…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Instead of instantly  pressing for answers on if it was Elio or not, Nanoha pretended to  think a moment. “Hmmm…Well my first crush was different, you  could say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wellllll….” The  girl proper her cheek up on her hand and thought about it. “We were  always together since we were little and everyone always thought we  were a couple so one day he just asked me if I want to. I said sure  and we tried it out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did it work?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not at all,” She  laughed happily at the memory. “Nothing changed at all. We didn’t  talk any more or any less. We didn’t hold hands more than we used  to, we never kissed, didn’t really do anything more than we used  to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, so it’s not a  good idea to rush things…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wouldn’t say  that.” She reached out to pat the girl on the head to lift her  spirits a little. “We were just friends and we’re still really  close today. I wouldn’t change that part of my life for anything.  We both learned a lot about each other and how we felt. It was then  that I realized there were two different kind of ‘loves’.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Two?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” She put a  finger to her chin in thought. “This may be a little hard to  understand since you’re still young but for example: my first  crush, Yuuno, is my best friend in the world. I love him a lot. My  current crush, Fate-chan, is my girlfriend. I’m <em>in</em> love with  her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-san and  Nanoha-san are a couple?” She looked pleased at hearing that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Nanoha  nodded happily. “We are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s so sweet!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So are Elio-kun and  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“H-how did you  know!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s plain as  day.” Nanoha laughed to herself. “So, Caro-san, how do you feel  about Elio-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m…not sure. I  always feel a little easier when I’m around him, as if I’m a  little stronger. I like touching him, too… Is that love?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I would say it’s a  nice start.” Nanoha smiled at the younger girl. “Where it goes  from there is up to you okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So go for it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Go for it.” She  led the girl back into the living room after the drink was finished  and had to bite back a laugh at the sight before them. Elio had a  very amused look on his face with Fate laying on the couch on her  back now. Thanks to her nose being stopped up, the girl was snoring  rather loudly. “Seems like she’s had all the fun she can stand  for a little bit…” Nanoha walked over to them and scooped up the  woman. “I’ll put her to bed.” The sounds cut off as Fate woke  up slightly from the movement. She sniffed lightly and moaned out  lazily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll let her get  some rest then,” Elio looked down at Caro when she took his hand  but didn’t say anything about it. “I’ll see you tomorrow at the  field?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You got it.”  Nanoha nodded at them and gave Caro an encouraging wink. The two left  hand in hand, saying something about getting lunch together. “Well,  that was interesting,” she mused to herself while carrying her  friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What was?” Fate  yawned out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro-san has a crush  on Elio-kun, it’s really quite cute.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmhmm,” Fate felt  herself being laid down and grabbed Nanoha’s shirt sleeve when she  went to move away. “Nanoha-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes Dear?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wanna make love to  me?” She gave her a sleepy smile, obviously more asleep than awake.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,” She teased.  “But you need to be better first, and to get better you need to  sleep. So be a good girl and rest up okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stay with me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha bit back a  groan. ‘<em>I don’t even want to –look- at my bed, let alone get  in it again…</em>’ Despite the thoughts the girl still nodded  cheerfully and lifted the covers to crawl under them. ‘<em>I’ve  been in this bed for the better part of en entire week almost…</em>’  Fate curled up onto her and rested her head back onto her chest. ‘<em>I  am a little tired from moving so much though…</em>’ She allowed  herself to cuddle up with her girlfriend. ‘<em>And besides, holding  onto Fate is always nice…</em>’</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha looked down at  her students and smiled nervously as the smoke rose from their  bodies. “Um, you all seem a little slow today… Did you slack off  while I was away?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” Tia moaned  out as she forced herself to roll over onto her back. “I just feel  funny today…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me too,” Subaru  sighed. “The world is spinning…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“… Please tell me  you’re not all sick!?” To answer her question, Elio stumbled over  to the edge of the field and threw up into the water surrounding  them. “Oh for the love of…” She looked over at Caro who seemed  to be more or less okay, minus the hard training session she just  had. “Caro-san how are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m fine,” She  smiled weakly. “Although if Elio’s sick then…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The instructor rubbed  the bridge of her nose. “You only have a day or so before you’re  gone too huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay… It’s  my fault for letting everyone stay over while I was sick first… Oh  man…” She thought a moment. “Everyone go to Shamal’s office  right now and get a check up. The rest of today’s training will be  cancelled and I’ll talk to the doctor before deciding what we’ll  do the next few days. Dismissed, and please take care of yourselves  okay?” The girl let out another sigh as the people picked  themselves up and staggered off. ‘<em>I guess I’ll make rounds  between them and make sure they’re okay for the next few days...’</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“I’m home!”  Nanoha called out as she walked through the door. “You here  Fate-chan?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Up here!” She  called from upstairs. “I’m on the bed!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio came to  training today,” Nanoha informed her as she walked across the  living room. “He recovered fast, hard to believe it only took him  two days to get over it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re used to it,”  Fate replied absently. “Subaru and Tia should be there tomorrow.  Caro-san is like you, though, so she’ll probably be in bed for  another few days. At least after this, everything will be normal  around here again. What a weird week.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see. Anyway, what  do you want to do…for…dinner…?” Nanoha’s words tailed off  when she saw her girlfriend on the bed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate blinked, wondering  what made her friend suddenly get a dreamy look on her face. Looking  down, she realized that she was only wearing her silk see-through  night gown and precious little else. On top of that; Bardiche was in  pieces around her, getting cleaned and lubed. ‘<em>That’s right,</em>’  She thought happily. ‘<em>Nanoha is a sucker for weapons and  technology and the like… Seeing me wearing this while working on  Bardiche probably has her so hot she’ll pounce me and force hot  fiery love-love on me until my body collapses!</em>’ A hot blush  went over her face as she brought her hands to her cheeks. ‘<em>Kyaaa,  what will I do?! If we start now we probably won’t get any sleep  and I’ll be too tired to spar with Signum tomorrow!... But if my  dear Nanoha wants too…</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh wow…!” Nanoha  finally managed out, cheeks coloring. She quickly walked over to the  bed and got onto it, crawling towards Fate. The blond opened her arms  up and closed her eyes, offering herself to her girlfriend. “Is  this the new model cleaning kit!?” Nanoha squealed out happily,  making Fate falter and look at her. “It <em>is</em>! They say that  the new lube prevents cartridge jams by ninety-eight percent!” She  picked up the cleaning tools and gasped at them. “And these will  make your parts run a lot smoother and reduce the heat transferred!”  Her hands picked up another item. “Oh my gosh, they even have the  magical distribution system wash in here! Raising Heart has been  overheating from my new shells so this would be perfect for her!”  Nanoha looked up into Fate’s eyes with an expression of a little  kid in a candy store. “Can I use the kit when you’re done?  Please? Please!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate sighed. “I don’t  mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you!” Nanoha  hugged her happily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re welcome,”  The red eyed girl smiled despite herself. ‘<em>Well, no love-love,  but if she’s happy then I’m happy too.</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“By the way,  Fate-chan?” She pulled back and allowed herself to look down at  Fate’s breast through the sheer fabric. “Lately I’ve been  having these weird…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Dreams?” Fate  finished for her, locking their eyes. “Me too.” The next moment  she found herself pushed back on the bed and lips claiming hers  frantically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Sir?” Bardiche  asked lightly, still dis-assembled on the bed as the two girls  started rolling over each other and losing clothing. “…Sir?” He  tried again. “Put me together again, sir?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bardiche,” Fate  gasped out as Nanoha’s head went to her chest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes sir!” The  device sounded happier now that he would be put back together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Start video  recording, camera on us please.” Fate grinned at her girlfriend,  pleased she would be able to release the tension that had built up  from staying in bed with her girlfriend for so long but not able to  do anything.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oooh, kinky,”  Nanoha purred as she rolled them over again so she was on top.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Yes sir…”  Bardiche answered after a small pause.</span></p>
