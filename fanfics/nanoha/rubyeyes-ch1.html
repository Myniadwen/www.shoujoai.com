<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The sweat rolled down  my face as I kicked the person in front of me across the head. The  clapping sound of the padding didn’t do much to ease my anger so I  followed it up with another kick and a punch to the stomach. My  opponent staggered back and almost received a following blow but he  waved his hands, signaling that he gave up. I stood still and panted,  most of my energy gone but I still stayed in the boxing ring. My  ponytail was matted to my back, clinging to the spandex tank top and  the exposed skin around my lower back and sides. Ignoring my fatigue,  I motioned up the next challenger, someone who towered me by almost  two feet and arms as big around as my thighs.  The reason behind my  anger came back to my mind and I clenched my fist through the boxing  gloves before screaming out and running forward.</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh wow, Nanoha-san  is pissed…” Subaru looked on in awe as the petite girl unleashed  her fury on the man in front of her. Although her physical attacks  didn’t seem to be hurting him all that much they were constant and  quick. Her opponent was trying his best to land in a few blows but  the girl wouldn’t let up, eventually pushing him back to a corner  post and giving him hell. “How long has Nanoha been kick boxing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Almost ten years,”  Hayate responded, scaring the girl who had apparently asked Tia and  not noticed that she was standing on the other side of her.  “Nanoha-chan isn’t really skilled with anything involving  physical strength, you should have seen her in high school; she  almost failed gym class every year.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She seems more than  capable,” Tia objected as she watched the fight which was quickly  ending.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Since Nanoha-chan  and Fate-chan were unique exceptions neither of them had to go  through boot camp. A special three month training program was all  they needed.” Hayate grinned lightly as the girl knocked out her  sparring partner and backed to the middle of the ring, almost hunched  over panting for air but not leaving. “Fate-chan was more than  limber enough to pass the physical training but Nanoha couldn’t  even touch her toes. They had to get her a personal trainer to tone  her body and decided that instead of the typical work out, she would  be taught how to fight hand to hand. Ten years later here she is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wow,” Subaru mused  just as Nanoha finally started getting hit by the new person in the  ring with her. A few moments passed before she dropped to the ground  after a hard right hook. She just laid there gasping for air as the  seconds were counted off. Before the ten count was finished she sat  up and waved her arms to signal defeat. The man she was fighting  touched his gloves to hers before helping her up and watching her  stumble out of the ring to collapse into a chair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s bothering  you?” Hayate asked softly, kneeling down by her and taking off the  padded helmet and gloves for her friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing,” Nanoha  panted out as she rubbed her face with a towel. “Nothing at all. I  was just wound up is all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Being ‘wound up’  doesn’t cover fighting seven straight matches. Something is  bothering you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I said it’s  nothing!” She countered harshly before gasping. “I’m so sorry;  I didn’t mean to yell at you.” Nanoha looked down sadly. “I  don’t know. I really don’t know.” The girl brought the towel  back to her face as Subaru and Tia looked at each other quizzically.  “I don’t know… what did I do…?” Hayate looked up at her  subordinates in a silent question but each just shook their head in  confusion.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">How long has it  been like this now?</span></em>’ Fate asked herself sadly as she sat on top  of the residential area of her section of the base. Closing her eyes,  she thought back to five days ago. The memory was clear in her mind,  as vivid as if she was reliving it. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was just like any other  night,</span></em>’ her mind went on as the sun shone down on her from  halfway into the sky. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We we got in bed just like we always did,  we said out goodnights just the same as before. Nanoha had always had  the habit of hugging anything close to her in bed, normally it was  the body pillow I bought her all that time ago… but that night…</span></em>’  Fate opened her eyes sadly. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Why did you have to hug me, Nanoha?  Why did you get so close?’</span></em> With a quick rub, she wiped away  the tears before they formed.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>That was the  night. The first night that I wanted more, the first night where I  wasn’t happy just looking at you</em>,’ Standing up, Fate jumped  lightly into the air and coasted slowly to the ground. ‘<em>You were  so close…I wanted to kiss you so badly I couldn’t stop myself  from leaning in… If you hadn’t whispered my name I probably would  have done it, telling myself repeatedly that you would never know.  You would never know that I would have broken your trust while you  slept, stolen a kiss that might even be your first, taken advantage  of our friendship...</em>’  The blond walked along the path to the  mess hall and opened the doors silently. Her eyes scanned the room  out of habit to see if any of her friends were there currently. When  her vision reached the point where they all normally sat together,  she saw Nanoha standing up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate quickly turned,  exiting the room despite her friend calling out her name. Walking  fast, she made her way over to the parking lot and got in her car  just as her friend left the building and looked around. Deciding it  would be best to hide herself instead of hurting her friend’s  feelings even more by driving off, Fate ducked over in her car so she  couldn’t be seen. Several moments passed before she looked up and  glanced around to make sure that Nanoha wasn’t still around.  “You’ve been avoiding her the past few days,” A voice made her  freeze. “Did you two have an argument or something?” The tone  made Fate blink, turning to look out her window to see her brother  leaning against the car next to her with his arms crossed. “Yuuno  called me and said Nanoha was crying because she thought she did  something to make you hate her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl looked down at  her steering wheel sadly. “No, she didn’t do anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Want to get  lunch?” she offered after a few moments.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“So you almost kissed  her in her sleep?” Chrono asked lightly, placing more French fries  into his mouth. His sister nodded lightly, making him sigh out. “And  now you’re confused about how you feel about her and are unsure  about everything, right?” Again he got a nod. “You can’t run  from this problem, Fate.” Chrono watched his friend slowly eat her  meal, not really looking like she was tasting any of it. “I  understand if you’re confused about your sexuality but no one  really cares either way if you like boys or girls.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not so much  as that,” She almost whispered. “I’ve already accepted that  part about me… it’s just…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Worried you’ll  lose Nanoha in every way?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Chrono!” Fate  suddenly looked at him, eyes shaking lightly. “She’s my <em>friend</em>!  We <em>live</em> together, we sleep in the <em>same bed</em>! We’ve  even showered together!” Light tears came to her eyes. “She trust  me like she would never trust a boy, she didn’t think twice about  letting me wash her back or lying next to her in bed… She only  smiled at me and said I was the best friend she’s ever had…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The male leaned back in  the booth of the fast food chain they were currently eating in.  “Aaaahhhh….” One hand went up to rub the bridge of his nose.  “Fate, I know you weren’t trying to take advantage of her. If you  were, you wouldn’t feel so bad for letting the thought alone cross  your mind. You can’t blame yourself for how you feel so get that  out of your head.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No buts.” Chrono  cut her off. “Fate, sis, take it easy on yourself. You did nothing  wrong okay?” He reached over the table and put a hand on top of  hers encouragingly. “You need to talk her, not avoid her. If you  keep this up then it will only hurt both of you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I… don’t think I  can say anything to her right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You rather her sit  on your bed alone while crying into her pillow? Because that’s what  Yuuno said she did last night.” He regretted saying it and wanted  to hit himself when he saw the tears brimming his sister’s eyes,  but he kept on. “Yeah, not a nice feeling is it? She needs you to  talk to her, to let her know she didn’t do anything wrong. After  that, you can talk about what’s going on. Knowing Nanoha the worst  case scenario is her being a little nervous around you for a while  but you know she will get over it and you will be friends again  eventually. You never know, maybe she even feels the same way?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m a girl,”  Fate stated the obvious. “Girls don’t like girls.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chrono gave her a weird  look.  “Says the girl who’s in love with a girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…” Fate looked  down. “Are you sure it wouldn’t be better to just-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sure. Stop  running, Fate. Stop running.” His eyes met hers and he gave her an  encouraging smile. “If you say you will talk to her today, I’ll  support you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha sighed, body  worn after the hard practice session she just had with her foreword  candidates. Looking in front of her she felt pity well up in her  chest at the sight of the four people slowly walking to the  residential area. She had taken out her frustration on them and she  felt bad for it. It had been a bad habit that she had for as long as  she could remember. Poor Arisa had normally taken the blunt of it,  but their arguments were just a way for the two to help each other  out. Now, however, she didn’t have anyone to vent her anger out on  without fear that they wouldn’t really understand her the way Arisa  did, so instead she focused the anger on herself to keep from hurting  anyone’s feelings.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was angry at  herself anyway; furious that she couldn’t figure out why Fate was  avoiding her. She had simply woken up one morning alone in her bed,  left to wonder why Fate had gone without even telling her good  morning. Fate preferred to sleep against the wall or at the very  least have the wall close to her, probably an old instinct from when  she was younger. Getting out of bed for Fate normally consisted of  literally crawling over the other girl or sliding to the end of the  bed, both of which normally woke her up- if only for a few seconds.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>What’s wrong,  Fate?</em>’ She asked herself quietly, stopping to look up at the  darkening sky. ‘<em>Why are you avoiding me?</em>’ The last few  nights alone had been rough on the girl, making her more and more  nervous. At first Fate had simply left a note saying she was going to  spend the night with Signum. The next day it was Tia that she would  stay with, claiming that the girl had questions about being an  enforcer. The third night was when Nanoha started to really worry;  Fate had gone to stay with Chrono for the night and left it up to  Elio to inform her of this. Three days and she hadn’t seen her room  mate once.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The fourth day was bad  as well, leaving Nanoha all alone in the large empty room once more  with nothing to do but watch the TV. That night she didn’t even eat  dinner, just sat on the couch while waiting for Fate to come home.  She had eventually fallen asleep, only to wake up hours later with a  blanket over her and a pillow under her head. A note on the table  simply read ‘sleep in bed or you will catch a cold.’ What really  hurt her feelings was that she had fallen asleep on the couch  countless times before, and always woke up in bed after Fate carried  her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yesterday was the worst  by far. Fate was obviously avoiding her by now; leaving the room as  soon as she walked into it, taking the long path to get where she  needed to go, and even taking to the air when they might run into  each other. That night it had rained hard and she sat on her bed  during the lightning storm alone, face buried into a pillow while  holding the teddy bear that Fate had bought for her one valentine’s  day so long ago.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>What did I do to  make you so mad at me</em>?’ She asked sadly. Now that the anger at  herself was fading, a familiar aching in her chest started to swell.  The girl took to the air, flying over to the residential area quickly  so no one would see her cry. She landed lightly on her balcony and  slid open the door, surprised to find it unlocked. The inside of the  loft apartment was lit, making her blink. As she stepped in a small  sound caught her attention and made her look to the right, where Fate  was sitting on the bed. She was all the way in the corner, back  pressed against the wall and hugging a large pillow while wearing  nothing but a long button up shirt. “…Fate…-chan?” Her words  made the girl’s shoulders stiffen a little. When no reply was  offered Nanoha’s face fell and she continued along her way. “I’m  just going to get something, and then I’ll be on my way,” she  whispered out just loud enough so her friend would hear. “You can  stay here tonight, I’ll leave, don’t worry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Of all the responses  she thought she would get, a choking sob wasn’t one of them. Nanoha  stopped walking instantly and looked over at the bed. Fate was  looking at her over the top of her pillow with tears flowing down her  cheeks freely. Her eyes were red and swollen and her breathing  indicated that she had been crying for the past little while  uninterrupted. “Fate-chan? What’s wrong? Are you okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The words were too much  for her. Seeing Nanoha blame herself so much but still putting  everything to the side to help out the person hurting her made Fate’s  heart break even more. “Na-Nanoha-chan!” Her body moved before  her mind would let her re-consider. The pillow was dropped and she  crawled two paces, reaching out a hand to the girl as if begging for  a hug. The brown haired girl was on her instantly, moving so fast  that the embrace almost hurt her. She found the girl’s arms around  her tightly and body sit to her side with one of Nanoha’s legs  behind her back and the other in her lap. “Nanoha-chan!” she  cried out again. “I’m sorry! I’m so-so sorry!” She felt the  other girl squeeze her more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shhhh…. What’s  wrong, Fate-chan?” Nanoha stroked the girl’s hair soothingly.  “It’s okay, don’t worry. I’m here now, I won’t let anything  hurt you.” She felt her own eyes brim with water and before she  knew it she was crying as well. “Just tell me what’s wrong  sweetheart; it will all be okay I promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate continued to cry a  moment longer before the words of the other girl started to calm her  down to a point where she could get her breath back. “I’m sorry,”  She repeated again although now more steady. “Nanoha-chan, I’m  really sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You haven’t done  anything wrong,” She encouraged her with another hug. “Don’t  apologize.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have,” Fate  protested softly. “I’ve done something that I shouldn’t have  done…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What did you do?”  Nanoha stroked her friend’s hair again, getting the blond to  finally look at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I… I fell in love  with you,” Fate choked out as new tears came to her eyes. Quickly  she put her face into her hands and cried into them, voice breaking  as she tried to breathe properly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha’s world  stopped suddenly for just a moment. “Wha… what?” She blinked,  unsure if she had just heard her friend correctly. “I don’t  understand…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate looked up from her  hands and into Nanoha’s eyes. Although she was sure that she looked  terrible at the moment she had no choice but to confirm what was just  said. “Nanoha-chan… I love you.” She sniffed, trying to keep  her nose from running and wiped her tears on her sleeve.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love you too,”  She replied easily, still not quite understanding.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” Fate brought  a hand to her chest and gripped her shirt, face looking as if she’d  lose it again any moment. “I’m<em> in</em> lo-love with you.” The  brown haired girl looked at her with a confused look for a few  seconds before realization struck her. The hold on the girl loosened  and she sat there, too shocked to reply. “I’m sorry,” Fate  whispered again. “I just accepted it myself, and I-I couldn’t  bring myself to upset y-you,” Her words were starting to break so  she took a deep breath to try and calm down. “I didn’t want to  pressure you or upset you or, or anything. So I tried to avoid you at  all cost… but it hurt so bad… It hurts…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate…-chan…”  Nanoha finally found her words, hugging the girl once more before she  started to sob again. “I… I’m sorry, I don’t know what to  say…” She closed her eyes and held her friend close. ‘<em>She  loves me,</em>’ the words echoed though her head while the two sat  in silence. ‘<em>I need to answer her but I don’t know how to…</em>’  The body in her arms was so still it frightened her. Looking down,  she saw Fate’s red, scared face. “I…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay…”  Fate looked down. “You don’t have to answer. I know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, it’s not  that!” Nanoha pulled Fate back into her hold when she tried to move  away. “I care about Fate-chan a lot! … I  do, I really do.” She  swallowed. ’<em>How do I feel about her?</em>’ She found her hands  stroking Fate’s hair again, something that she knew would calm her.  ‘<em>When I see her like this I want to scream out. I want to  protect her from whatever it is making her cry…’</em> Pulling her  close, Nanoha simply held her while resting her cheek on the blonde’s  head. ‘<em>Is that love? Do I love Fate?</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha closed her eyes  and rocked back and forth, trying to keep her friend steady while she  thought. ‘<em>She’s a girl too, what will other’s think… I  don’t really care what other’s think, does that make me gay? Am I  gay?</em>’ She took a breath. ‘<em>Okay, if I am, do I have  feelings for Fate?</em>’ Nanoha mentally kicked herself. ‘<em>Of  course I do, otherwise I wouldn’t be holding her right now! Okay,  calm down. Think. She’s obviously killing herself with worry right  now, you have to say something.</em>’ The mental pep talk worked and  she took another slow breath. “Fate-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha pulled back just  a little so she could wipe the tears from her friend’s eyes. “Are  you sleepy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Want to go to sleep  and talk about this in the morning?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…You don’t hate  me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Touching me  doesn’t make you sick?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No! Oh god, Fate,  no!” Nanoha quickly hugged her again, finally realizing just what  the girl must have gone through the past few days. Her chest ached  deeply, resenting herself for allowing herself to get angry about  what was going on. All this time she had thought she had wronged Fate  and never even took the time to consider the fact that she might be  hurting on her own. “I’m sorry, Fate-chan. I haven’t been the  best person the last few days.” She felt Fate try to say something  but she continued before she could. “But don’t worry. I don’t  hate you. You don’t make me sick. I’m scared and confused right  now, but I still care for you deeply…” She leaned over and kissed  Fate’s temple. “I don’t know if I’m in love with you… I do  love you, though. You are very important to me, I promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha shifted and  leaned the girl onto the bed. “Stay here, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay?” Fate looked  absolutely terrified. “You’ll come back right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, I will.”  Nanoha nodded at her before crawling off the bed and walking to her  dresser and taking out her favorite night shirt. Moments later she  made her way over to the light switch and clicked it off. Already the  sun was down and thanks to the hanging rain clouds, the room was put  in a sudden pitch blackness. The girl changed cloths in the dark and  felt her way over to the bed before crawling into it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-chan?” Fate  whispered, voice soft but still holding a note of being worried. “Do  you… want me to scoot away against the wall?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No…” Nanoha got  under the covers and reached out, finding Fate’s hand. “I… I  honestly can’t answer you tonight,” She admitted, gripping the  hand. “But I will think about it okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you…so much…  for not hating me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan…”  Nanoha scooted closer to her, just enough so she could put a hand  onto the other girl’s waist. “I’ll tell you tomorrow okay? Can  you wait until then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” she answered  honestly with a small hiccup and half-laugh. She could felt Nanoha  smile lightly so she did as well. “But I will. Sweet dreams, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. You too,  Fate-chan. Have sweet dreams.” Nanoha closed her eyes slowly and  felt Fate shift a little to try and get comfortable. ‘<em>…I don’t  even know how to start thinking…</em>’</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate awoke slowly,  opening her eyes just enough to look over at the large windows that  made up part of their wall. It was still dark, but the hard sound of  rain beating against the glass made her realize that she couldn’t  tell the time by sunlight that morning. Groggily she made to reach  above their bed to pull their alarm clock to look at it but found her  arm was pinned to her side for some reason. Her sleep-clouded mind  looked down to see why she couldn’t move and found Nanoha in front  of her, draped more on her body than not. Time ticked by slowly for  her as she laid in bed, too nervous to make herself move. “Are you  awake?” a voice suddenly asked, making her flinch a little.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, I’m still  asleep,” She teased lightly, making the blonde’s lips twitch.  “Ah, you smiled.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Fate felt  her lips turn up more. “You do that to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m glad…” The  two looked at each other a moment before Nanoha moved her body so she  was straddling Fate’s waist and leaning over her. “Fate-chan?  About last night?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?” She  swallowed, looking up at her. “If you want to stay friends I will-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sshh,” she shushed  her softly. “Fate-chan…” Nanoha smiled down at her a little  un-easily. “I’m sorry, Fate-chan, this is all so sudden so I  can’t give you a clear answer…but,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…But?” Fate held  her breath.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I will try…”  Nanoha blushed lightly. “try being your girlfriend… If what I  feel is love then, someday, I’m sure I’ll tell you. Until  then…until then, can we take it slow?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate gasped lightly.  “You mean it…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.,” Nanoha  nodded lightly. “Ask me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Will you…” The  blonde looked up at her friend, a hope shining in her eyes that  Nanoha hadn’t seen for the longest time. “Nanoha, will you be my  girlfriend?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The simple word made  everything okay again. One solitude word made her chest lighter, her  body less tense. Everything that she had worried about came off her  shoulders all at once from that short answer. Fate raised up her  hands shakily to wrap around the girl above her. Nanoha allowed  herself to be pulled downwards onto the girl and embraced fully,  listening to the happy unsteady breathing coming from her new  girlfriend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ever so slowly Nanoha  pulled away from her and rested their foreheads together, giggling  lightly. “Wow, my first girlfriend! My mom will be thrilled.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you want, we can  keep it a secret?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” Nanoha shook  her head lightly, rubbing hers against Fate’s. “I made up my  mind; I want to know what it is I feel for you.”  She brought one  hand up to Fate’s cheek and gently caressed it. “I meant it… I  do care for Fate. A lot. I want to be there for you when you cry and  also when you smile. I want to share those moments and many more with  you as well. I don’t want to hide anything at all…”</span></p>

The two girls looked into  each other’s eyes a moment before slowly leaning towards one  another and sharing their first kiss. “Here’s to the start of a  great relationship,” She whispered softly against her girlfriend’s  lips.</span></p>
