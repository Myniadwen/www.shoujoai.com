<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shutting down the displays in front of  me made a smile come to my lips. Finally, after waiting anxiously for  weeks, my final day before vacation was over. Leaning back I  stretched out widely before waving to my precious students as they  walked past. Subaru took time to talk with me as we made our way back  to the main section of the headquarters and waved goodbye before  heading off to her own room. With a happy spring in my step I quickly  made it to my quarters to prepare packing for my few days back on  non-administratived planet num... Earth. I was working <em>way</em> too hard lately it seemed. Pushing that aside, I opened the door  after a quick hand scan and was greeted by the scent of cookies. At  first I thought that my roommate had bought a new candle or something  but after inspecting the kitchen I discovered both Fate and Vivio  talking to each other with a plate of still hot cookies between them.  Normally this wouldn't bother me but lately Vivio has been eating a  lot of treats with Fate and I was starting to worry about the little  one's health. After talking with Fate she told me she would back off  a little with the snacks and yet still went and did this... I was  honestly quiet upset about it.</span></p>
</span>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Spinel  Heart</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By:</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-mama!” Vivio cried out  happily when she saw the other woman enter the small kitchen area and  immediately held out her arms in a request to be picked up. The small  girl overbalanced and almost fell from her place on the counter top  but was quickly saved by a rushing Nanoha.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate pulled back her hands after making  sure Nanoha had the girl and sighed out in relief. “Mou,  Fate-mama,” Nanoha scolded. “I've <em>told</em> you not to let her sit on the counter, she could hurt herself!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I won't let her  fall,” The blond protested as she offered a cookie. “Say Ahh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I've already  asked you not to feed her so many snacks.” Nanoha took the cookie  and placed it on the platter. “No more, you'll spoil your dinner.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vivio's eyes  watered slightly, little hand reaching to the plate. “But... but  cookie!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” Nanoha  held firm as she carried her into the living room. “No snacks  before dinner, if you're hungry after you eat then you can have  some.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate followed them  with a hand on her hip. “Nanoha-mama, aren't you being a little too  strict?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Vivio is still  growing!” She sat her daughter on the cough and turned back to her  room mate. “If you constantly feed her junk food then she may not  grow up healthily.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don't <em>constantly</em> feed  her junk food.” Fate crossed her arms. “I just want to spend time  with her; you grew up in a coffee house-sweet shop so baking with  your mother was probably common place. I would have given anything to  bake cookies with my mother.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That's fine and  good, but after ice cream yesterday and snow cones the day before and  taking her to that pizza place and arcade game center and all those  little fruit snacks you feed her, she may get sick!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  there were healthier places that held the interest of a four year old  I <em>would</em>, but there<em>isn't</em> so I'm <em>not</em>.”  She stressed her words, showing that she was beginning to get  slightly annoyed at the nagging. “You're always so 'by the book' on  everything, you need to lighten up and have fun with her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sitting  her in your lap while doing your paperwork is <em>not</em> fun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't need you  to tell me how to spend time with my daughter! We have fun! I'm even  taking her home to see my parents for Halloween tomorrow!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, by my  idea!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you don't get  a little more serious with her, she'll grow up to be a slob!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Better than  growing up to be a work-a-holic who doesn't know how to have fun in  moderation.” Fate frowned at the look she was getting. “Children  are easily influenced at this age, we have to be good role models so  they'll grow up to mimic their parents!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you saying  I'm a bad influence!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm saying maybe  you should let have have more fun instead of always being so work  focused like your parents!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then stop  getting on my case and being such a bitch like yours!” The words  hung thick in the air, cutting off all sound as soon as they were  said. Fate's face went from angry to shocked instantly and Nanoha  knew right then that she had crossed the line. “Fate, I didn't mean  that, you're not like-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  think I'm like her?” Although barely whispered the sound still  stung the other girl's heart deeply. “Vivio... I would never...”  All at once the sadness was replaced by rage. “How <em>dare</em> you say that I would-” Snapping, she raised her hand to slap Nanoha  for the comment but suddenly stopped in her tracks, looking at the  hand with a scared expression. “I...I have to go.” She quickly  ran past her friend and out the door, only stopping to grab her shoes  but not bothering to put them on just yet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly the blue  eyed girl tore her eyes from the slammed door and looked over at  Vivio. Her daughter was looking at her in shock, holding her stuffed  bunny in a tight hug and looking as if she was about to break down  and cry at any moment. “Why,” Her words were broken by a sniffle.  “Why are Fate-mama and Nanoha-mama yelling?” Nanoha looked back  at the door one more time before slowly kneeling down and giving her  daughter a hug.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha looked out the window from the  couch and yawned to herself softly. The sun was already starting to  come up, making her realize that she had fallen asleep at some point  while waiting for Fate to come back. Slowly she stood and rubbed her  neck as she made her way to the stairs and going up them to check her  bed. No one was there except for a sleeping Vivio hugging the pillow  Fate had sewn together for her a little after they had met. Ever  since then Vivio had trouble sleeping if she wasn't clinging to  either of her mothers or the little pillow. “Vivio. Vivio, wake up  Honey.” the words worked and the tiny girl slowly sat up and rubbed  her eyes with both hands. “The sun's coming up, time to get ready  to go.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm sleepy,” Vivio complained  tiredly while giving her an exhausted look. “Can I sleep some more,  Mama?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At first Nanoha was going to say  something about how sleeping in was a bad habit to have but the image  of Fate scolding flashed across her memory. “Ah, it's okay, Vivio.”  Gently she leaned over to ease the girl back onto the bed. “You  just rest up, Mama will make sure everything of yours is packed okay  Honey?” She got a sleepy but very happy response and soon was given  the vision of a pleased Vivio's sleeping face. '<em>Maybe Fate was  right...</em>' Taking a few more  moments to enjoy the sight, she gently tucked a strand  of hair behind her ear. '<em>Maybe I am being a little to  strict... She's only four...</em>'  Nanoha let out a soft sigh. '<em>Maybe I wasn't really ready to  take care of her... If Fate wasn't with me...</em>'  She had to push the thought aside in order to get to work on making  sure they were ready. Hayate had only booked them a ten minute window  for their teleportation to a warship close enough to Earth to make  the second jump.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Time passed quickly  as she worked and finally managed to get everything together in a  small collection of suitcases. By the time Vita knocked on her door  she was ready to be off, carrying her sleeping daughter against her  chest while still trying to pull along their luggage. She had been  counting on Fate to be there as well and was forced to request Vita  to help her lug everything to the control room. Hayate was already  waiting for them with a smile, waving slightly as they came in.  “Morning Vita-chan, Nanoha-chan. Fate-chan already went ahead of  you two; she said she would meet up at your parent's house later on.  Oh, and the rest of us will be coming tomorrow like planned. We still  meeting for lunch?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” Nanoha's  voice sounded a little upset despite her best efforts to cover it up.  '<em>Fate-chan's still mad at me,</em>'  Her mind thought absently as she stood on the teleporting area. “I'll  send you a long distance  letter through the usual routes if anything  comes up.” If Hayate noticed her change in tone she didn't show it.  Instead she simply nodded and waved slightly in a farewell, taking  the un-given hint that Nanoha wasn't in the mood for idle chatter  that morning. The world blurred around the woman carrying Vivio once  and then again almost immediately when she arrived on her midway  point on another warship patrolling near Earth. Finally done, she  opened her eyes and shivered when the soft wind of her home planet  blew around her. The sun was up already here but not by much, giving  the area a slightly chillier feel than it would have a few hours into  the day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her normal  transportation spot had remained the same as it had been so many  years ago when it had first been placed here. A semi large flat stone  in her parent's backyard with several markings greeted her when she  looked and as always, the area around it was completely clear of  anything that would hinder a transport. Shifting Vivio, she walked  towards her house and decided she could get her luggage after making  sure her little one wouldn't catch a cold. The door was unlocked and  after stepping into the house she smelled the fresh scent of coffee  and even muffins baking. Her parents knew she was coming this morning  and apparently set up for her first return in almost two years. As  she walked into the kitchen, she leaned against the door frame and  watched her family fuss over things. Words like 'She'll be home any  moment now!' and 'Are the muffins done yet?' echoed around the busy  kitchen as they scrambled, not yet noticing her. With her fill of  watching, she smiled and greeted them. “I'm home.” The two simple  words made the room go silent before everyone rushed her at once.  “Shh!” She scolded them happily, eyes sparkling. “You'll wake  Vivio.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Vivio?” Her  mother asked softly as she hugged with her daughter tightly. “This  little girl?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha's father  hugged her next, just as close. “Wow, is she a student of yours?  They must start at a really early age on that planet huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After giving her  brother and sister a bone crushing hug as best she could while  holding the child, Nanoha smiled. “Nuh uh, Vivio is my daughter.”  She looked fondly at the girl resting against her breast.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ehhhhhhh!?”  The startled cry echoed loudly from everyone in the room after a few  seconds of pure shock.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ahhh!” Vivio  cried loudly, gripping onto Nanoha hard. “Mama!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, don't  scream so suddenly!” Nanoha scolded them. “You scared Vivio!”  Turning to her daughter she spoke softly to her. “Don't worry,  sweetheart, my family was just surprised to see us so early is all.”  The words seemed to work slowly, allowing Vivio to open one scared  eye and look at the people giving her weird looks.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“D-daughter?”  Momoko stammered out, pointing at Vivio. “B-but she's like five or  six isn't she!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shiro put a hand to  his head. “That time those years back when Nanoha was in the  hospital for a year...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Miyuki almost  cried. “She was knocked up and was raising the child all on her  own!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha laughed  nervously. “Um...That's not really how it happened...” Ignoring  Vivio's patting on her chest, she turned to her father. “...What's  with the look, Daddy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who's the  father? Is it Yuuno? I knew you two staying together would lead to  this!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What!?  Yuuno-kun!? N-no way, we only dated for like a month!” Still  ignoring Vivio's attempts to get her attention, she went on. “I  don't know who her father is, she's an artificial mage.” Her last  words seemed to be drowned out when her brother Kyoya gasped out.  “Brother, don't be like that, you don't know what I mean! She  doesn't have a father!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey!” Vivio  finally called out, getting Nanoha's attention. “Is Fate-mama going  to be here soon?” Her innocent question made the room go silent  once again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um,” Nanoha  blushed darkly when her mother fainted. “Mom! Whoa, Mom! Hang in  there!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My sister is a  lesbian...” Miyuki spoke the words aloud to try and accept the  fact.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And has a  daughter with another woman,” Kyoya added in, amazed. “Well, the  world is more advanced than we are...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  stomped her foot. “Now see here! I am <em>not</em> a lesbian!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momoko, having  woken up, looked at Vivio with a surprised expression a while before  finally leaning forward when the little one clung tighter to Nanoha's  shirt. “I have a grand daughter?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-yes, in a  way.” Nanoha stammered out while trying to clear up the  misunderstanding.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello,  Vivio-chan.” Momoko greeted her gently. “I'm your Mama's mama.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vivio put a finger  to her mouth in thought. “Gran-mama?”  After getting a nod and  smile, she accepted the offer to be held by the new woman. “Hello!”  She remembered to introduce herself. “My name is Vivio, I'm four  years old!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well now,”  Momoko smiled more, ignoring the shouts and protest behind her over  Nanoha's sex life. “Can you tell me who's child you are?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-mama's  and Fate-mama's!” Vivio nodded happily. “And, you know, I love  them both very much! We always sleep together in a big bed, and, and,  they always hug and kiss.” In her simple childlike words, she  managed to comment on how much she enjoyed being loved on by her  mothers and didn't notice that her statement would be taken the wrong  way. “We're a happy family!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Noooo, Vivio,  sweetheart!” Nanoha ran over to her. “Don't say it like that,  this is a misunderstanding...” The child's eyes went wide then,  tears forming. “No, no! Not about that. Ohhh come here baby!”  Taking her child back, she rocked Vivio in her arms. “Fate-mama and  Nanoha-mama love you very much and you're our child, I didn't mean it  like you took it. Please don't cry!” She felt her neck be hugged  tightly. “Please, will you all listen to me now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shiro put a hand on  Nanoha's free shoulder and nodded at her. “We still love you,  Nanoha.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And we always  will,” Miyuki added in, smiling. “You being gay doesn't change  anything at all!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  flushed. “Mou, will you <em>listen</em> to me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momoko gasped out.  “Ah, the muffins!” running to the oven she opened the door to  take them out. “Miyuki, get the plates ready please! Kyoya, is the  table set? This is our Nanoha's first home cooked meal in years,  let's make sure everything it right!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Defeated, Nanoha  looked at Vivio face to face while holding her. “Well, I suppose  I'll just tell them later about how our magic works.” The two  looked at each other a few moments longer before Nanoha kissed  Vivio's forehead. “Come, let's get you introduced properly to the  rest of your family.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha opened the  door to her house after hearing the soft knocking on the front door  and was greeted with the image of Fate shyly looking at her. “Um,  hi.” She welcomed her friend, stepping aside to allow her entrance  to the house. “...About last night,” Her words were cut off  quickly when Vivio's voice came from across the room. With her little  arms spread out she ran quickly towards them. “Vivio, be careful,  your shoelace is untied!” Nanoha took a step forward but Vivio had  already tripped, landing gently into the arms of an awaiting Fate.  “Is she okay?” Worry was in her voice as she jogged across the  living room towards them. There was a small scuff mark on the floor,  an obvious sign Fate had employed her Sonic Move ability.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She's fine,” Fate replied softly  as she tied Vivio's shoe. “Sweetheart, don't run with your shoelace  untied okay? Remember how to tie them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm sorry,” Vivio looked down  sadly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha was about to start worrying  about waterworks but Fate was already ahead of her. “Don't worry,  we know now right?” Fate got a small nod. “Then later let's sing  the bunny song while we practice tieing our shoelaces again, okay?”  She got another nod, this one a little more happy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bunny song?” Nanoha inquired, once  again amazed at Fate's ability to handle their child.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you want to teach them something,  you need to make it fun,” Fate replied in a matter-of-fact tone.  “Otherwise you lose their attention span.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha looked towards the floor, once  again faced with the hard truth of Fate being a much better mother  than she was. “I see,” Her words came out softly, her pain  evident in them. “I'm sorry, I'm a bad mama.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate stood up, missing the whispered  words thanks to the sudden greeting she was getting from Nanoha's  family. “Hey everyone, it's been a long time.” She hugged each of  them in turn, pleased at the tight embraces she was receiving. “You  all seem so giddy today, has Vivio been making you run around too  much?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momoko laughed happily. “No, not at  all! She's been the perfect little angel. You and Nanoha have done a  great job in raising her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shiro stood up next to them also and  hugged Fate once more. “We always said you were part of the family,  now it's becoming true!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate blinked. “Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Daddy!” Nanoha blushed darkly.  “Not now!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Looking back over to her friend, the  blond blinked. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now now, don't be shy! Nanoha told  us already, congratulations!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mom, I told you-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha was cut off by her sister.  “Fate, how long have you and Nanoha been dating?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dating!?” Fate gasped, looking  over to her partner in shock. “Whatever do you mean by-” She  stopped talking when Nanoha pointed frantically towards a startled  Vivio. “Oh! Um, I dunno, hehe, time sure flies, you know? Haha...”  Her laughter was weak but it still fooled Vivio, making her smile  once again and latch onto her mother while declaring how much she  loved her. “Um, Nano-er-Darling, can I have a little word with you  please? Like right now?” Walking over to her, she pinched her  friend's arm hard when she tried to make an excuse to avoid the  upcoming confrontation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey-ow- okay already.” Speaking  louder, she smiled to her family. “Um, going to show Fate what you  did to my room, we'll be back down shortly.” Nanoha giggled  uneasily while Fate almost dragged her up the stairs. “Fate-chan,  that kind of hurts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,” She apologized briefly  before closing the door. “Okay, <em>why</em> am I suddenly gay and dating you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Geez, you don't  have to be so pissed about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A brief look of  sadness passed over the girl's face before being replaced by a  slightly annoyed one. “Mou, Vivio was having a fit about it when I  tried to explain it to my family, she probably thought we were  splitting up or something! I didn't have a choice, I was going to  explain it later tonight when Vivio was asleep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can't just  agree with something like that and drag me into it, what if they  talked to my mother before you said anything?” Fate looked at  Nanoha's face and tried to soften up as best she could. “Look, I'm  sorry, I'm just... I dunno.” Crossing her arms, she faced away from  her. “...Maybe I am a bitch after all...” Her voice went from  angry to sad all at once, making Nanoha look down in shame.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan, about  that, I-” Her words were cut off yet again with a call from  downstairs. “Coming!” She shouted back instantly. With one last  look to Fate's back, she decided now wasn't the best time to take her  hand and instead simply opened the door again. “Come on... let's  get you something to eat?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm...” Fate nodded sadly to  herself. Together the two walked downstairs again, stopping only to  allow the blond to pick up Vivio and carry her. “Um, thank you for  taking my stuff here.” She looked over at Nanoha and saw a slight  twinge of a smile at her lips. It wasn't much, but still made the  uneasiness around the two best friends a little easier to deal with.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vivio, not noticing her mother's  situation, hugged Fate's neck happily. “Hey, hey, Fate-mama?” She  got a hum in response. “Will uncle Yuuno be here too? He promised  me candy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate sighed out, making Nanoha speak up  quickly. “Um, Vivio, Uncle Yuuno meant candy in a few days, for  Halloween. On that night you can eat as much as you want, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Halloween?” She asked, head  tilting to the side.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This time the blond responded.  “Halloween is a holiday here on Earth where little children dress  up and try to scare people. When you go to a house you yell “trick  or treat!” and the person will give you candy for being so scary.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vivio put a finger to her mouth and  sucked on it softly. “But, why do they give candy for being  scared?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um...” Fate thought about it.  “Yes, it really doesn't make much sense does it? Anyway, they just  do. It's for fun, right Nanoha-mama?” She looked over at her and  saw Nanoha biting her thumbnail. Turning back to Vivio, she watched  her suck on her finger. “Well, I wonder where that habit came  from.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh!?” Nanoha stopped instantly  with a small blush. “Mou, you said you thought it was cute!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momoko walked between them happily.  “Now now girls, you can flirt when you've finished having lunch;  Fate must be hungry.” She accepted Vivio when the little one opened  her arms out to her and carried her towards the kitchen with the  other two embarrassed ones in tow. “The others are coming later?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha nodded to herself. “Mm, they  are going to be staying with Arisa-chan and we're all heading back  the day after the Halloween party held by Suzuka-chan's company. They  should get here tomorrow sometime.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momoko smiled happily when Vivio looked  around the kitchen and started eyeing the cookies she had made for  their café. “Is it okay to give Vivio a cookie?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um,” Nanoha spoke up before Fate  could. “We're... trying to get her to like healthier snacks...”  Her words trailed off, feeling Fate's eyes on her. “So...um...well...  Maybe one wouldn't hurt...” Slowly she turned to her friend but  found her already involved in a conversation with her brother.  “...Yeah...”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha looked across the bedroom,  sitting in silence while waiting for her friend to come back from her  bath. Vivio had already fallen prey to the spoiling grandparents and  was snatched up for the night in their bed, leaving her alone with  her supposed girlfriend. Minutes ticked by slowly as she sat there,  warmed only by the small heater in the room. Hey eyes glanced around,  still feeling a little odd being in her old room that seemed so  different than before. Her walls were now a cool cream color, showing  various pictures along the wall. It was obvious her room was turned  into a guest room, as almost nothing of hers was left behind save a  teddy bear that would forever grace the bed. A clock on the wall  slowly ticked the seconds by with a small clicking sound for each one  that passed. Along with the silence of the small house, it was  starting to drive her mad. Ever so slowly her eyes started getting  heavy, already being past her bedtime. More than once she almost fell  forward onto the floor but caught herself in time with a quick jerk  upwards.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally Fate entered the room slowly,  carefully closing the door behind herself as if to not make a noise.  “I'm awake,” Nanoha spoke softly above the pillow she was holding  and couldn't help but smile to herself when Fate was startled by her  words. “Have a nice bath?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You shouldn't have stayed up,”  Fate scolded instead of answering her question. “It's late, you  need sleep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can sleep in.” She knew she was  lieing; when the sun was up, normally so was she. “I'm sorry I  didn't get a chance to tell my parents tonight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't bother,” Fate sighed. “After  calling each other 'Darling' all day they won't believe it anyway.”  She walked in the dark room until she made it to the bed and sat on  it. “I'll just have to tell my family before it gets out of hand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So it's okay if mine thinks we're  gay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don't seem too phased.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha looked down. “Fate-chan says  such mean things...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You started it yesterday.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was <em>trying</em> to apologize all day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don't sound  sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  fumed. “Well, after <em>that</em> comment, maybe I'm not!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Christ, why are  being so stubborn lately?” Fate turned on her, glaring. “Can't  you just be nice to me during this time!? Why all of a sudden are we  fighting?” Her words once again changed drastically as they were  spoken, ending with a more of desperate plead then anger. “We've  never argued before now...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is up with your mood swings  lately? Is it your time of the month already?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate gasped, again getting angry at the  statement although it wasn't intended to be an insult. “Never mind,  just forget I said anything. Goodnight.” With that she crawled over  the bed and got under the covers, facing the wall.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ugh, fine.” Nanoha got under the  covers as well, looking away from her. “See you tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Yuuno-kun?” Nanoha gasped happily  as she walked into her backyard, seeing her best male friend walking  around while holding Vivio on his shoulders. “When did you get  here!?” She ran over to him quickly and hugged the man as best she  could while he still held onto her daughter. “Oh wow, how long has  it been? Three months? Four?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Way too long,” He agreed readily  while kneeling to allow Vivio to hop onto Nanoha and then be placed  on the ground. “I just got here a little while ago; I can't believe  you slept in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh, I didn't sleep really well last  night so I couldn't help it.” She scratched her cheek. “But  anyway, I'm glad to see you again!” She gave him another hug and  got it returned with a laugh. “I missed you! Are you doing well?  Eating okay? You're sleeping enough right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, mother,” He grinned. “I'm  just fine, so how are you and Fate doing?” The sudden loss of  playful air made him blink. “I'm sorry, did I ask something bad?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um, we're kind of... arguing right  now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Arguing? You two? Over <em>what</em>?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I...really  don't know.” Nanoha sighed and rested her forehead against his  chest. “We've both tried to apologize but it just keeps turning out  wrong for some reason...She's being really difficult to handle  lately, her emotions are way out of whack.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah it always  happens around this time, huh?” He stroked her hair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This time?”  She blinked, looking up at him. “What do you mean this ti-” her  eyes went wide, hand going to her mouth. “Oh! Oh-oh-oh!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You<em>forgot</em>!?” Yuuno  looked shocked. “You of all people should-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I<em>know</em>!” Nanoha looked  ready to cry at any moment. “It was around this time of year when  her mother died and all of that stuff happened! Ohhh, and I said all  those things! No wonder she's so unstable right now!” Pacing, she  hugged herself. “I'm horrible...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, whoa, hold  up.” He grabbed his friend's shoulders to keep her still. “You  know how Fate is, she's just easily hurt when it comes to things like  this. If you clearly try to make up with her and apologize, won't it  be better?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With a slow nod she  agreed. “But... What to do? Last night I really tried but she's  just so defensive and...well, no, I suppose it was more my fault...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Weren't you both  into tennis while living on Earth?” He raised an eyebrow at her  knowingly, getting a nod. “Why don't you take her to play while  you're here? Work off some steam, have some fun, and then apologize?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha looked up at  him for a few moments before breaking into a smile. “You know,  Yuuno-kun, that's a really good idea!” The girl took up a thinking  pose with one hand on her elbow and biting the thumbnail of the  other. “I bet I can get Suzuka-chan to loan me some Earth money now  and later, when she's approved to visit Midchilda, I can give her  T.S.A.B issued money to spend there...Okay it's settled! Come on,  let's get going.” She grabbed his arm and started pulling him to  the house. “Viviooooo! Stay where Gran-mama can see you okay?”  She got a happy drawn out reply from the small girl running around  happily.  Yuuno stumbled at first but caught himself enough to walk  with her and inquire why he was going too. “Because,” She replied  easily. “I'm going to have to buy things and you're going to carry  my bags.” She smiled cutely up at him. “Right?” Yuuno sighed  out, nodding in defeat. “Yay!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate looked around  the house absently, wondering where everyone could have gone. Finally  deciding to look outside she went to the door to retrieve her shoes  but stopped when it opened up quickly and banged into the wall from  the force of it. “Fate-chaaaaaaaaaan!” Nanoha yelled out happily  before stopping and looking at the girl not a foot from herself  rubbing her ears. “Oops.” disregarding deafening her friend she  kicked off her shoes sloppily and trotted towards the couch. “Come  here!” She merrily sat a few bags down and made room for Yuuno to  collapse down with the rest of it. “You saw Yuuno-kun this morning  right?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate nodded, still  a bit surprised by Nanoha's sudden happiness. “Uhn, we had  breakfast together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good, then I  don't need to wait.” She offered the blond a rectangular white box.  “Jaaan! This is for you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly reaching  out, she took the box timidly. “What is it...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Open it and find  out,” Nanoha was bending over the couch while rooting through the  other bags around Yuuno. “I have more, just give me a moment to dig  them up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Doing as she was  told Fate ran her fingers around the edges to make sure there was no  tape holding it together and then popped the top off it, revealing an  oddly shaped carrying case. “Is this a...?” Dropping the box in a  rare moment of carelessness she unzipped the bag and took out a  glossy black tennis racquet with neon yellow strings. The handle was  wrapped firm in matching painfully yellow binding as well to maximize  it's performance. “It's lovely...” Slowly she drew a finger  around the edge and bit back memories of her high school life when  she would often play the sport with her friends to ease the stress of  being mages. “But Nanoha-” The rest of the sentence was cut off  when she saw what the other girl was holding out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I thought these  would look good on you,” Nanoha explained briskly. “Although I  wanted something a little darker since you like those colors I could  only find...” Her words went on and on but were mostly tuned out by  Fate as she accepted the gifts and inspected them. A white miniskirt  with black trim running along the bottom and a red curved stripe  going from the middle front along one side and ending in the middle  of the back. Paired with the skirt came a black sleeveless shirt that  would show off her stomach when her arms were raised. Red trim looped  around the neck, sleeves, and bottom of it along with a red line  around the chest area that would make her breasts appear larger than  they really were. Finally there were two black wrist sweatbands to  complete the outfit. “...But they didn't have any sneakers that I  thought you'd like so I...Fate-chan? You listening?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh? Oh, sorry, I  was lost a moment...” She looked at them again before meeting  Nanoha's eyes. “But why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because,” Was  her simple answer. “Go get changed, let's go to the park.  Yuuno-kun, will you watch Vivio for us while we're there? She would  want to play at the playground probably.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man sighed.  “Nanoha, I really need time to help set up for the Halloween party  soon and-” his vision was cut off with an upside down image of  Nanoha bending over the back of the couch with her eyes looking  straight into his. The two stared at each other, Nanoha's smile  getting bigger and bigger as his willpower faded. “...Fine, I'll  babysit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're a doll.”  She gave him a quick peck to the forehead. “I don't know what I'd  do without you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno stood up and  stretched out widely. “Sure, sure. I'll hunt the little one down  you two go ahead and change.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha was already  ahead of him, grabbing her outfit and running off to her room with  Fate in tow. Inside her box she revealed a white casual shirt with a  thick blue stripe starting under her short sleeves and running down  the side of the shirt. Matching blue sweatbands were tossed on the  bed as she wiggled out of her jeans and pulled up a white miniskirt  that looked much like a cheerleader's. Finally she slid down her  simple orange panties in favor of pink frilly ones she just bought.  “Nanoha,” Fate's voice met her ears making her turn slightly to  look at the blond holding up a pair of panties that matched hers,  only in yellow. “What gives with these lacy things?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If we're going  to panty-shot everyone while we play, might as well give them  something to drool over?” She closed her eyes and smiled, meaning  it as mostly a joke to try and make her friend laugh. “You always  told me everyone always came to watch us play just to see our panties  remember?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That was high  school!” She protested with a dark blush. “And-and we were on the  tennis team! It was... normal!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw come on!” Nanoha giggled. “Live  a little!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're an exhibitionist, I swear.”  Despite her words she still changed into them. “Always flying  around in skirts, giving people little shows...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey!” She blushed. “Those skirts  are standard issue! I can't help it if the pervs decided to give the  air force miniskirts to fly around in.” Nanoha turned away from her  friend and pressed her two index fingers together while pouting. “You  don't really think I'm an exhibitionist do you...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.” Fate watched Nanoha turn  around quickly, face splashed darkly with color. “But since I'm  wearing them too, I'll say no this once.” With that she winked and  grabbed her racquet before running out the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You little hussy!” Nanoha called  after her as she grabbed her own before giving chase. “You take  that back!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The sound of a ball being hit echoed  loudly around the small caged off area that held three tennis courts.  Crisp dead leaves fluttered across the ground as two girls darted  across their respective sides to try and return the simple yellow  fuzzy ball back to where it had come. Wind blew softly around them in  a slight chill to cool the sweating figures as they danced to the  rhythm of squeaking shoes and thumping of returns. Blond hair flew  thickly from the ponytail it was restrained to, black ribbon flaring  from the motion and wind. Focused red irises eyed the moving object  and followed it across the court and over back onto her side. Shoes  scuffed the ground, heartbeat roaring in her ears along with the  gentle breeze, and swung her racquet quickly. Hair caught up with her  body when the motion stopped and splashed against her frame only to  be removed from another twist and run towards the other side of the  field. This time she knew she couldn't make it and was confirmed when  she had to reach out early in an attempt to simply bunt the ball  back. Her goal glanced from the tip and spun wildly out of control  until it touched the ground and rolled silently out of bounds.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Point!” Nanoha cheered out happily  as she thrust one fist up into the air with a small hop. “I haven't  lost yet!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm still ahead,” Fate reminded  her as Vivio scurried across the court to retrieve the small ball and  bring it back to her mother. “Thank you, Vivio.” She smiled  fondly at her before turning back to Nanoha and narrowing her eyes.  “I still win if I score before you do!” With the taunt set she  threw the ball into the air and smashed it against her racquet.  Nanoha got serious all at once and dived to the side, back slicing  and sending the object back over. The blond's eyes narrowed once more  and timed her breathing with her steps. The ball clashed against her  black and gold racquet soundly with a small clacking sound. Over the  net it went and bounced at a low angle, making Nanoha literally roll  across the ground to return. Her feet slapped against the ground and  kicked away from it hard in an attempt to clear the distance across  the court in time. Her return made it but just barely. Fate cried out  in shock as she darted forward to get the ball that was lazily  dropping onto her side of the net. It bounced once before she dropped  under it and clicked it back up and over the net slowly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha was already there, shoes  slipping lightly on the fine dust and crushed leaves on the court as  she swung hard. The ball picked up it's momentum immediately and  crashed against Fate's racquet just as hard. The two fought back and  forth with each other as they slowly backed up from the net by  sending their drives a little higher as they went. Finally the brown  haired one ran forward after a return and took Fate by surprise by  almost literally spiking the ball back onto her side and away from  her. “Point!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That was out of bounds!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Was not!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Too!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno-kun!” Nanoha turned to the  side where Vivio was hurrying to get the ball for them. “Tell her  it wasn't out of bounds.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The male smiled lightly. “Sorry Fate,  it was in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou!” Fate stomped her foot and  glared, not trusting the biased judgment. “Nanoha could tell the  biggest lie in the world and you would swear your life to it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The other girl giggled. “That's the  advantage of having an ex still be your best male-friend.” She  stuck out her tongue but quickly sucked it back in when Raising Heart  formed a monitor in front of her. “Ah! Captain!” She saluted the  female on the screen quickly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vivio watched the two people talk a  moment before deciding to return the ball to Fate instead.  “Fate-mama,” She greeted, holding the ball up high with both  hands so the blond could pluck it. “Who is that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That,” Fate told her while  watching her friend. “Is Nanoha-mama's training superior. When  Nanoha-mama goes out to learn new things, that's who she goes to...  But why she's calling here on Earth during Vacation is beyond me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma'am!” Nanoha saluted again with  a large smile plastered on her face. “I'll be there tomorrow! First  thing!” She got a smile back and the screen cut off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tomorrow?” Fate asked as she got  back into position to serve. Vivio ran back over to Yuuno and hopped  into his lap after climbing up onto the observer's bench.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was chosen to come to speak to the  new recruits at the introduction ceremony!” Nanoha replied happily.  “The one I was planning on attending!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But... You got vacation time and had  to miss it.” Fate told her, unsure of what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know!” Nanoha chirped out, still  smiling. “But a speaker couldn't make it and they asked me to come!  This is so great, I was looking forward to this!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you're on vacation!” Fate  protested. “Tomorrow we're taking Vivio trick-or-treating and then  to the Halloween party!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A few hours won't hurt,” Nanoha  waved it off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A few hours <em>will</em> hurt!” She went on. “Nanoha, you can't miss this! This is Vivio's  first time trick-or-treating! We promised to take her together!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha lost her  smile. “Fate-chan, this is really important to me! I'll still be  there for the party.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Vivio needs you  with her before then!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Vivio  understands that my work is important! Why can't you be happy for  me!?” Seeing as Fate wasn't going to serve she picked up a ball and  swung it over to the other side. “This is a big part of my life!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  dropped her ball and returned the serve out of instinct rather by  intention. “You are a bigger part of <em>her</em> life!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  hit it back, purposely making Fate run for it. “I'll <em>be</em> there! An hour won't hurt!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  glared, foot tapping the ground and sparking off as her speed  increased out of her anger. The world slowed down, blurring into  black and white as she charged the ball. '<em> You idiot!</em>'  Her mind through harshly as she swung her arm as hard as she could. '<em> I want you to be with us!'</em> The  ball screamed out, ripping the air in it's wake. Half way across the  court Fate wondered briefly why Nanoha hadn't moved yet before  realizing that she was still in her accidental sonic move. “Nanoha!”  The spell was broken but it was too late. The ball hit Nanoha's hard  on her face, forcing her off her feet and flying back a few inches  before crashing on her shoulders and cracking her head on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Instantly one hand  went to grip the back of her head while the other grabbed her face.  Nanoha kicked her feet out in shock while trying to understand why  she was suddenly in pain. “Nanoha!” Yuuno was already next to her  in an attempt to calm her down. “Stop moving, let me see!” He  soothed her enough to get to look at her face before turning and  glaring at the blond. “Dammit Fate! She did this to try and make up  with you! Why couldn't you just be happy for her!?” Not waiting for  a response he scooped her off the ground and into his arms. “Vivio,  I'm going to go heal Nanoha-mama, stay with Fate-mama for now okay?”  With that he ran away towards the changing rooms next to the courts  for privacy</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  sank slowly to her knees, racquet falling onto the ground as tears  rolled down her cheeks. '<em>I hurt her... I hurt her...</em>'  The words repeated over and over in her mind, even when Vivio walked  up to her and gave a questioning look.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Mou, Fate, why  are you so glum?” Arisa put a hand onto the other girl's shoulder  and gave her a knowing look. “You're normally the life of the party  and hanging all over Nanoha, what gives?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate blinked,  startled out from her thoughts by her old friend. “Um, sorry, I'm  just... not feeling well. Sometimes... when you teleport to another  planet it messes you up for a while...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, okay then.”  Arisa nodded, having heard that line since they were in junior high  together. “But try to perk up okay? Everyone is having a blast.”  She nodded over to the jam packed house full of all their friends,  even the forwards under Nanoha. “It's ultra rare we all are able to  get together so feel better okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um, yeah.”  Fate smiled as best she could. “Hey, have you seen Nanoha?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Her mother took  her upstairs a moment ago.” Arisa pointed to stress her comment. “I  think they were checking up of Vivio's nap time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks.” With  that she made her way through the mass of laughing people and walked  up the stairs slowly. The girl took a steadying breath before  rounding the corner. “Nano-” She was cut off by Momoko shushing  her happily and motioning for her to come over. The red eyed girl  obeyed the request and peeked through the cracked door to look into  Nanoha's room. The brown haired girl moved slightly so Fate could see  in as well and the two observed what was going on inside while Momoko  went back downstairs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vivio was awake  now, standing in front of a mirror while wearing Fate's enforcer  jacket top. Her little arms barely allowed it to stay on her body but  she didn't seem to mind, swinging them out as she held an imaginary  conversation with herself in the mirror. “What's that?” Vivio  asked herself with a pose. “Drones in the city? I'll have them done  in time to bake cookies tonight!” With those words she gripped her  hands together as if she was holding Bardiche and fought the  imaginary enemies flying around her until she tripped on her own  baggy shirt and fell to the ground. Nanoha chuckled to herself,  ignoring Fate's hand on her back while trying to peek in better  without being discovered. The child in the room wiggled out of Fate's  clothes and instead put on Nanoha's flight uniform skirt despite  almost being able to wear it as a dress. “Oh?” She asked herself  again, pretending to be in another conversation. “You need the best  Ace of Aces to attend a conference! Why yes I can come! My friends?”  Here she made a tutting motion and looked like she was stating the  most obvious thing in the world. “My work is more important than  that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha gasped  loudly and stood up straight, hand covering her mouth. Her eyes shook  in fear, already beginning to water. Slowly she turned to Fate  started to shiver. Her mind raced quickly to decide if she needed to  run away and think or if she should take refuge in her friend's arms  despite what they had been going through lately. By the time she  chose to run Fate had already met her eyes and opened her arms up  acceptingly. The motion overpowered any doubt in her mind and she  could only see the kind and loving friend that she had known for more  than half her life. Her first sob was loud, breaking her breathing as  she buried herself tightly against the breast of her friend.  “Ssshhhh...” Fate soothed her, stroking her hair softly. “Come,”  She felt herself be embraced fully and shifted to be carried. Where  they were going was lost on her, only repeating the words spoken by  Vivio again and again in her mind. Each time it went through it was  changed slightly, finally ending up with Vivio stating that she  didn't need friends at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">By the time Fate  stopped moving Nanoha was calming down from her initial fit and  instead chose to simply cling onto her and sob silently into her  chest. “Fa-Fate-chan...” She whispered as she was placed down and  embraced from behind. “I'm a... horrible mother...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” Fate told  her softly, gently making Nanoha look up at her. “You're new at  being a mother.” She smiled calmly, meaning the words. Nanoha's  face changed slightly as she thought about the opinion and looked  away from her to chew over the thought. Despite having a broken nose  not three hours earlier, Yuuno's healing magic had fixed her up as  good as new. The only remnants was a stopped up nose that made itself  even more apparent now with the tears added in. Wind blew around them  softly and Fate gently hugged Nanoha closer to share her warmth. She  had taken them through an open window and out onto the roof of the  house for privacy and in hopes that the setting sun would ease  Nanoha's troubles.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Vivio...”  Nanoha sniffed again, trying hard to calm herself down enough to  talk. “She's... growing up just like me...” One hand went to her  face, wiping away her tears desperately with her palm but not  succeeding in making them stop flowing. “I...” She coughed on her  own words and refused to look at Fate anymore despite the gentle  urgings. “I wanted her to be like you,” Nanoha's confession only  seemed to make her even more upset. “I don't know how... I just  can't... without you I...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shhhh,” Fate  soothed her again, pulling her closer in the embrace. “Calm down  first then we can talk. I won't go anywhere.” She felt Nanoha nod  slightly and simply held her friend closely while the time ticked by.  Minutes passed by before the sobbing turned into slight gasping and  then into simple crying. “Now, calm your breath and tell me what  you're thinking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why...?”  Nanoha finally looked behind herself towards the one embracing her  from behind. “After everything I've done...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Silly,” Fate  told her, once again giving the gentle smile. “I'm the one who was  wrong, I know that now. You was trying to do everything you could so  you could take better care of Vivio. We have different views about  things, but even if we argue over them, I won't ever stop being your  friend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I... I was  wrong.” Nanoha gripped a handful of her friend's casual house  shirt. “Fate-chan... You're so good at being a mama... I know now  that I dived into this too soon. I'm not...” She swallowed, finally  accepting her own words. “I'm not ready yet to be a mother. When I  think about what would happen if... if you wasn't with me.” Nanoha  swallowed, once again wiping her eyes. “Fate-chan... I'm sorry,  I'm so sorry!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For what? Our  arguing? Nanoha, there's no reason to-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!” She  sniffed again, shaking her head. “It's not that! I just... I can't  say it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell me,” Fate  encouraged her softly while rubbing her arms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can't... You  will never see me the same way again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When I was  nine,” Fate suddenly brought up the past. “I was someone who  wouldn't listen to others no matter what. It wasn't until I reached  out my hand that I was able to see things as they really were. You  were the one who helped me then, Nanoha, and no matter what you say  or do I will never forget that you are my friend, that I care about  you deeply.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Promise me...  That you will still be here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I promise.”  Fate stroked her hair again. “Now, tell me what's causing all of  this. I can tell this isn't just about Vivio.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha took a slow  steady breath. “Fate-chan... The reason I suddenly started becoming  so obsessed with work... the reason I stopped cuddling with you and  started working late hours...” Gathering her courage, she looked up  into her friend's eyes. “I realized something. When I adopted  Vivio, when she called us both 'mama' for the first time, when we all  slept together in our bed... I wanted more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More?” she  encouraged.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes... I wanted  to be like a real family... I wanted... love.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Vivio loves you  very much, as do I.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No...  I want <em>love</em>.”  She  stressed the word to get her point across. “I... wanted to love  you.” Nanoha winced inwardly when Fate's body tensed up.  “Fate-chan... I'm gay. I just accepted it recently and.. and I like  you. In that way. I'm sorry.” Silence washed over them slowly. The  leaves scattered around the two girls as they sat on the roof  together without speaking. The only noise came from the slight  whistling of the breeze and the happy cheers down below muffled by  the walls of their home. Not sure of how long they had sat there like  this, Nanoha slowly pulled away from Fate and found no resistance  stopping her. “I started hating myself,” she went on eventually.  “How I could fall for my best friend, how I could ruin our  friendship, how I might make Vivio sad again if we split apart  because of it.” Her eyes drifted towards the setting sun. “So I  tried to hide it, to bury it under work. If I worked non-stop then I  wouldn't be with you as much, wouldn't feel you cuddle with me while  watching movies... wouldn't... want a family with you and Vivio...  But I went too far, I pushed you both away too much. I'm sorry, I  didn't know it would end up like this... us fighting, Vivio thinking  like that... By trying to push you away I ended up doing just what I  was trying to prevent: hurting our friendship and ruining Vivio's  family.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm...  going to go inside.” Fate stood up slowly. “You should come too,  you'll get sick if you don't get warm, okay?” Her words were soft,  unsure of what she should say.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan...”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate  opened the door to Nanoha's room slowly and stepped into the  darkness. “Nanoha?” She asked lightly. “Are you awake?” Her  response was only gentle breathing sounds coming from the bed.  Pausing just long enough to gather her courage she closed the door  and walked over to the place her friend was. Sitting, she scooted  over until she was right next to the laying girl. “We need to  talk.” Again she was only replied with soft breathing sounds. “I  shouldn't have gone away like I did... I'm sorry for that.” Still  soft breathing. “... Nanoha, I know you're awake. You snore like a  chainsaw when you sleep.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do  not.” Nanoha protested instantly before kicking herself mentally  for revealing that she was, in fact, awake.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha,  I'm sorry. That was so much of a shock...I didn't know how to  respond.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  simple 'I'm not gay' would have been enough.” She whispered softly  into her pillow, fighting back tears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha...”  Fate reached out slowly and touched her friend's head but didn't pull  away when she flinched under the touch. “I know running away was a  really horrible thing to do, but I was just so scared...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's  okay. Please, just leave me alone a while.” Her voice got tighter.  “I can't handle this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha,”  The blond repeated her friends name yet again. “I've known for a  while now that I'm not like most girls. I... don't really know if I'm  gay but I can handle being bi for right now...I think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan?”  The words made her open her eyes up and stare at the outline of the  dark figure of her friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I...  really don't know what to say,” Fate stammered out. “Um, I like  you, a lot, but you know... never thought thought that... I mean... I  wouldn't mind... you know, because it's... I don't know.” She tried  to hide her face in her hands. “Nanoha, I'll try it... dating you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  if you're uncomfortable...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  am,” Fate admitted readily. “I'm uncomfortable with myself... My  feelings are... I've always liked Nanoha; I don't feel anything  different from yesterday or today. The idea of us being together,  holding hands...kissing... it's the same to me, all this time I've  felt like this... I just... never wanted to admit I was gay... I  don't think I am, but with you I wouldn't mind... Nanoha, I'm still  so very, very, confused...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's  okay,” Slowly sitting up she reached out and touched Fate's cheek.  “We can...take it slow?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  Fate shook her head. “I'd feel like, I don't know... I'd feel like  I was using you, or something... I just need to confirm for  myself...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate laughed  nervously, wiping away her own tears. “How strange... I can't stop  crying...” She found her hands being gently taken and a nose  touching hers. “Nanoha?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can we... see  for ourselves? What this is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate swallowed.  “Promise me something first?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This... isn't  just making up for our arguing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, this is for  us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And... If one of  us realizes in this kiss that the emotions we feel arn't-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay. Still  friends. Forever. It will be awkward if that's the case, but we'll  overcome it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate slowly took a  breath. “Right...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiss me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You kiss me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two girls  stayed silent a moment before each gave out their own nervous  giggles. “Okay,” Nanoha steadied herself. “Here goes.” The  breath of Fate danced across her mouth lightly as she leaned forward.  Slowly she moved her hand out to find her friend's and gently slid  their fingers together. Her other reached up to lovingly caress  Fate's cheek with the back of a finger before slowly touching their  lips. The intimate contact made them both tense up for a moment,  making the kiss awkward at best. Pulling back, she licked her lips  and tried again. This time Fate accepted a little easier, pressing  forward ever so slightly to make the contact more meaningful. A third  kiss followed shortly, this time started by Fate. One hand moved to  Nanoha's side and gently pulled her down onto the bed on top of her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another kiss.  Breathing was getting hard now, each trying to figure out how to take  in air that didn't belong to their partner. Small gasp came before  their lips met again, wetter now that they were getting used to it.  Bodies pressed against each other, getting comfortable under the  covers as their hearts started beating faster. Hands trailed over  sides and arms, trying their best to sooth the nervousness still  emitting from each other. Finally Fate made the first move, arm  looping around the small of Nanoha's back and hugging her close. Lips  parted, tongues escaped. Their question had been answered, their  feelings confirmed. It didn't matter now, they had found each other  and nothing could break the new feelings of love discovered in one  simple night. Days of frustration with each other faded, now just  something to look back on and laugh about. Weeks of uneasy feelings  left, replaced by warmth of each other's bodies. Months of longing  and questioning had been confirmed, and years ahead would be given to  the new lovers as they explored each other with a passion long  suppressed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No motions to stop  were given, only encouraging gasp and curious hands fueled the fire  needed to keep going. No longer were they doing it for themselves;  now it was more personal, wanting to share the feelings discovered.  The two parted slowly, staring deep into each others eyes in silent  questioning. Fate's face was gentle, staring up at her lovingly, as  she nodded slightly. Their mouths met again, bodies shifted to become  closer, hearts beating in unison.</span></p>
