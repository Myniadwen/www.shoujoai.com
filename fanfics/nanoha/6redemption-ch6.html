<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Seeing  Nanoha's body awoke something inside of me that I had always repressed,  always forced down whenever it came in my gut. Fighting was always  something I had done, but there was a boundary, a limit, a line that  was to never be crossed. Anger, rage, personal revenge, they had  nothing to do with my job, and as such I never let them bother me. I  was to fight who I was commanded to, to subdue them and bring them in  for judgment. Never was I to fight for the sake of fighting, to hurt  for the reason of hurting... But now... that didn't matter now. He  crossed the line, he had killed the person who saved me, gave me a  purpose, gave me feeling, gave me love. She was gone, and I felt  nothing but rage. I would cry later; right now I had to avenge her, to  kill the man who stole her from me. Gripping Bardiche hard, I glared at  the person and felt a shiver run down his spine as our eyes met. No,  killing him wasn't enough... It would never be enough to sooth the pain  in my heart. I felt my throat tighten as his hands went over my  ex-lover's stomach and my feet pressed hard against the concrete as I  made my first attack.</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Orca  looked to the side when Fate vanished from his sight. Turning his head,  a flaring yellow energy missed his neck by centimeters. Fate's body  blurred, again ripping her sword against and through the auto barrier  generated by him, turning his attention to the backside where  Bardiche's blade failed again to make it to his skin. His mind worked  fast, preparing to counter the next attack and did so easily when Fate  tried to attack again from above. Thrusting out his hand, he reached  out to grab the woman's neck but felt only air when he grasped for it.  Seconds later Fate landed softly on the ground away from him, slowly  placing Nanoha down. “Ha ha ha haaaaa.” Orca shook his head in an  amused manor. “I didn't even see you take her.” His voice drug out the  words, almost as if he was enjoying saying them. “Tell me, girl, could  you be the one to finally challenge me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate shook, turning her  tear stained eyes back at him and letting out a roar that rang from the  bottom of her throat. The war cry scattered the dust on the ground next  to her as she flashed forward once again. Her scythe bounced off Orca's  shield and flared into zamber mode to prevent a counter attack from  being released on her. The woman twisted in the air, snapping the  handle of her weapon and making the pulsating blade break longways into  two half-swords. The one in her left hand slashed downwards only to be  punched away. Not giving up, she flicked her right one sideways and  felt it flare through the shield but still being forced away from the  body enough to do no damage. Her feet touched the ground for only a  moment, being swept out from underneath her. The Azure Sea's body  turned around in the spin kick and followed it quickly by grabbing her  ankle and throwing her half way through the building next to them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  rubble didn't have time to completely fall before Fate was already back  to him, slinging her weapons rapidly. Orca grinned at her devilishly,  pushing forward and grabbing her wrist to sling the woman over his  shoulder. The force broke the ground under them but did nothing to stop  the screams of fury still coming from her mouth. Raising her hand, Fate  sent several glowing lances at her opponent in an attempt to make him  gain distance. The attack worked long enough for her to reclaim her  footing and move forward again. Halfway she was clotheslined in her run  and found herself once more looking into the air. A punch shattered the  ground where her head was just laying, forcing her to turn onto her  stomach and go into a handstand, lashing her foot out. Orca bent  completely backwards at the same time as his foot swept the area. Fate  snarled loudly, flying at that level just long enough to attach one of  her swords onto her boot and reclaimed her handstand. Turning quickly,  she rotated her body with her legs spread apart in a hurricane kick.  Orca leaned to the side, tried again to trip her, and flipped over her  other leg when his attack failed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Bardiche's other sword embedded  itself into the ground, giving the blond a place to shift her weight  and correct her stance. Now upright, she kicked out one more time  before reclaiming the plasma blade in her other hand and ripping the  first upwards. Orca grabbed the offending blade with his hand, smirking  at her as he punched her stomach. The area flew around her as she  rebounded against a wall some ten feet away from the battle. Again, she  flew back into close quarters combat space before he could even fully  register his attack had met it's mark. Growling hard, she flashed her  weapons again and again, getting harder and faster with each swing.  Time and time again her blades bled through the shield but couldn't  seem to reach her mark. Her opponent finally caught her wrist again and  turned her around, quickly grabbing her other and holding the woman  tightly in his arms. Slowly he ran his nose from her shoulder up along  her neck as she screamed and struggled to escape his grasp.  “Delicious,” He whispered to her softly, smiling to himself. “I  wonder,” he continued as Fate kept crying out madly. “Would you taste  as heavenly as your lover did?” His tongue ran along her cheek.  “No...she tasted much, much sweeter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate's eyes dilated to the  point where nothing but red could be seen. Images of Nanoha's torn  barrier jacket flashed through her mind, making her break his hold and  turn around, punching as hard as she could but not making it through  the barrier he had.<em> “I'll kill </em>you!” In her fury she couldn't  find anything else to say, repeating the same words over and over as  she thrust her weapons at him. Each one ripped into the barrier,  obviously moving faster than him, but never touching the man enough to  cause harm. Finally she felt her hair being grabbed and soon found  herself doubled over after a magical blast at close range. She knew  whatever hit her had cracked a rib but the pain didn't register, didn't  matter. Glaring at the ground, she noticed a basketball sized sphere  roll over to them and flash a few times before exploding, blasting both  of them far apart.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who's there!?” Orca yelled out though the smoke, anger that his battle was interrupted was evident in his voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“  'Fraid you messed with the wrong people,” A female voice stated as the  dust cleared. A tall woman stood, clad in a tight form fitting top and  pink shorts that barely covered anything. The figure brought up her  hands, cracking her knuckles before wiping her mouth with the back of  one of them. Behind her a long tail swayed while shifting into a battle  stance. “Nobody messes with my masters!” Arf glared at him with one  fang showing over her bottom lip. Despite staying in child form for so  long she didn't seem phased any to suddenly be so tall again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Her  familiar,” Orca smiled to himself as he was rushed from both parties.  Fate was still in a blind rage while attacking, obviously not seeing  anything except for him. The thought made him smile more, fighting back  harder to avoid being hit for a while before finally kicking her  familiar out of the way and blasting Fate point blank in her face. The  attack was supposed to gain him some breathing room to taunt her but  instead he found Bardiche's blade ripping across his arm in a searing  heat filled roar of pain. Startled, he gave the woman enough time to  form her own magical blast and fire it, slinging him several yards away  to skid on his back. “What...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“AMF,” Arf stated, holding her  side in agony from the single attack landed on her. “Improved to become  an area of effect in the air instead of emitting from a device. Did you  think I was just hiding when you attacked? As soon as you came, I was  already getting the one thing that could be our edge on you Azure trio!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Orca  laughed loudly as he stood. “Idiot, an AMF would hinder you as much as  it would me!” His words stopped when Fate stood up again, re-igniting  both of her half-swords. A yellow ring of energy was glowing around her  throat, wrists, and both ankles as well. Stepping forward, she glared  at him, eyes boring into his soul and crushing it with her presence.  “An anti-AMF...” Narrowing his eyes, he glared at them. “So that's how  you beat Jail...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Arf,” Fate finally spoke to her familiar. “Stay away.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I said stay away!</em>”  She screamed her words. Panting, seething, glaring, she focused her  eyes on Orca. Both swords shook in her hands, mental images of Nanoha's  battle flashing across her vision. “I'm going to kill him myself!”  Running at Orca again, she leapt into the air and twisted around,  slashing her sword diagonally at him. The Azure Sea leaned counter-side  to the strike and turned his body around to dodge the follow up.  Flipping backwards, he flew above a horizontal swipe and bent over as  her other sword flashed again. Fate gripped both swords by their ends  and thrust them both forward to give him no choice but to jump back and  slide on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The dirt crunched under him as he slid away  from Fate, blasting four magic projectiles at her as he did so. The  attacks were knocked aside easily by the blond's swords but the force  of the attack made Orca spin around at the end of his slide. The woman  took a chance and ran at him, jumping at the very end as he stood and  narrowly missed him with her double stab. Four more energy daggers  sliced through the air, giving Fate just enough time to deflect two of  them before taking the rest with the front of her body. Again the pain  didn't register, only anger came from the attack and in her fury she  swapped how she held her left sword and threw it at the man.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Orca  narrowly escaped the attack, shoulder being sliced slightly as he  literally dove out of the way of the surprise move. The blade embedded  itself in the building behind them but was left alone by the two. Fate  was already in front of him again, using her other sword to slash down  madly. Orca twirled around her, slipping down to his knees and forming  a dagger of energy in his hand as he did so. With a proud smirk from  the move, he slammed the weapon as hard as he could, ripping straight  through Fate's barrier and boot, pinning her foot to the ground. No  yell of agony came to his ears, making him look up and meet the red  eyes of the devil.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate's arm ripped sideways in an attempt to  decapitate the shocked man but only succeeded in taking a few hairs off  the top of his head as he ducked. Swapping stances, she moved her sword  upwards at him instead. Orca moved back and made a desperate attempt to  move his head to avoid a kick from the now free leg of Fate. The energy  dagger still in her foot itched his skin as it flashed by him but soon  found her other foot slamming into his neck fully. Wasting no time,  Fate flew up in the air slightly before forcing herself down to choke  him. Her other leg kicked downwards, stabbing Orca with his own energy  in her foot. With a cry of anger Fate lifted her first leg and stomped  her injured foot, forcing the dagger through her own body and deeper  into his. The blond flipped back and landed on the ground, not feeling  the grinding pressure on her trembling wound as it unknowingly suffered  to hold up her weight.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly Orca righted himself and grasped  the dagger in his chest to dispell it. His opponent snarled once again,  turning the handle of her weapon and making a yellow string of energy  come out from it. With the new plasma rope she gathered herself for an  attack that included throwing the thread behind herself to wrap around  her previously disregarded sword. The man watched her rip it from the  building and pull it over to herself in mid jump. Dodging backwards, he  felt a rush of adrenaline curse through his veins from the thrill of  the fight he was getting. Fate thrust downwards at him but missed once  more. Her attack continued by using the force of the attack to propel  herself in the air once again and swing her other sword down into the  ground before finally moving into a third and final stab that also  missed it's target. Again the man found himself ducking and twisting  around Fate's mad kicks as she balanced herself on top of the embedded  sword in the ground while trying to land a clean shot on his head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Having  had enough of the balancing act, Fate jumped off it and twisted around  with her other sword, stabbing down and grazing Orca across the chest  as she landed. The next moment she found herself sailing through the  air from a hard kick enforced by a magic blast. Crashing back against a  building, she let out her first cry of pain as she landed. Images of  Nanoha struggling blindly came to her mind, feeding the flames she  needed to push herself up and once again run forward. At the last  moment she turned into a flip, grabbing her sword from the ground, and  lashed out madly in an attempt to cut the man in half. Before the  attack had time to land her enemy was already in the air, legs apart in  the splits as the blade cut nothing beneath him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate turned  sharply, throwing Bardiche at him once again and having it deflected  back at her from one of his magic energy daggers. Catching her sword,  she threw her other to block a second dagger of his and caught it a  once more as they ran. Bardiche was hurled at him again, clashing  against the dagger a third and final time. Orca spun around as Fate  sliced and placed his foot on her blade, pinning it to the ground and  running up it to flip over her body. As he landed he turned and grabbed  the blond hard when she tried to fly away, catching her around her  waist and squeezing her. “I'll crush you in half!” His yell of triumph  was cut short as a sudden screaming of pain filled his chest. Air  escaped him and before long he felt as if he was choking, drowning  despite not being in any water. Slowly he looked down and saw  Bardiche's blade coming from Fate's lower back and felt it rip out of  his when she pushed it deeper into her own stomach.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two  landed roughly, each barely standing up as the split apart. The woman  turned and glared at him harshly, one hand pressed against the would in  her stomach but kept a sick smile of satisfaction on her lips when she  realized she had punctured one of his lungs. “ You're mine now.” She  told him, sword shaking in anger still.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah,” Orca knelt against his will and tried his best just to breathe. “But your prisons...won't hold me for lo-aahhh!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  twisted her sword in his shoulder before pulling it back harshly.  “...No.. you aren't going to jail...” Their eyes met firmly once again  as she slowly reached down and gripped his neck to haul him up to be  level with her face. “I am going to destroy you here and now.” The  words paired with the still burning eyes made Orca feel something he  couldn't remember the last time he encountered. Fear consumed his body  as the woman prepared to strike again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Arf tried as hard as she  could to tune out the sounds around her as she gently touched Nanoha's  cheek in a soothing manor. “Nanoha?” She asked softly, eyes starting to  water. “Wake up... please wake up...” Moving to her shoulder she shook  tenderly. “Nanoha... Please... Fate needs you...” Her beckoning stirred  the female slightly. “Nanoha? Nanoha! Wake up!” She shook a little  harder, tears brimming in her eyes. “Please!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ar...fu...?” The word escaped her mouth slowly, eyes opening and looking around blindly. “Where am I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In town,” She told her, relieved that she was speaking. “Are you okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sick,”  She replied, giving up her attempt to hold up her head and looked  blankly up at the sky after letting herself fall back again. “He made  me breathe something when he punched me...I think I'm poisoned... Can  barely move.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Arf wiped her tears away from her eyes and scanned  Nanoha's body as best as she knew how. “I think it's only a numbing  poison... no wonder we couldn't see you breathing...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!?”  Fate's voice was shocked as she fell to her knees to cradle her lover.  “But you... I mean... You was...” She ignored Arf's sad look at the  blood covering her barrier jacket and instead fussed over the woman in  her arms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I won't die from that,” Nanoha told her while allowing  her head to lean against Fate's body. “Mou, Fate, you think so little  of me?” Tear drops fell on her cheek, shocking her. “Eh? Are you  crying?” Ignoring her name being repeated, she spoke up again. “Wait,  what happened to that man? Did you fight him? Are you okay?” Louder  sobs answered her as she was slowly tilted to the side. “Fate? Fate?”  Suddenly she found herself on the ground and heard pain filled cries  next to her. “Fate!? What's wrong!? Arf, what's wrong with Fate!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  idiot!” Arf was screaming as she lifted her master's shirt. “You  shouldn't be moving! How did you get thi-...” Her words stopped  suddenly, realizing that what she saw wasn't a trick on her eyes. “Fate  you idiot! You <em>idiot!</em>” grabbing Bardiche from her, she brought  up an M2D screen. “Hayate!? Yuuno!?” Signum answered her call but she  cut off before she could say anything. “Fate's in danger, she may die  soon!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Suddenly Shamal's face was on the screen. “Can you bring her here!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I-I don't think we should move her, she stabbed herself straight through her stomach!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>What</em>!?”  Nanoha's voice drowned out the others, pleading as loud as she could  around their conversation to get answers. “Fate? Where are you!?” She  patted the ground around herself weakly until she found her lover's  body and gripped her hand. “What happened!?” Fate only panted, looking  up at the sky with a tired pain filled expression.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Her adrenaline is wearing off,” Arf noticed in worry. “Shamal please get here soon...”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“And  they teleported here shortly after Fate left to get you,” Yuuno was  finishing up as they sat in the living room of their house. Thanks to  the properties of the magic barrier their real home was unscathed from  the battle earlier despite being destroyed within it. “The others got  here not two minutes before you returned.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno-kun,” Nanoha  whispered to him softly as she held onto him a little tighter. “Please  tell me the truth... how is everyone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At first he wanted to lie  to the scared girl but forced the feeling down as soon as it came. They  knew each other too long, fought side by side more than enough to know  how battles worked. If he lied she would know, and he didn't want her  to worry about the people who were really okay. “The forwards are  asleep right now. For the most part they are okay. Caro and Lutecia  exhausted their cores to the point where they won't wake up but their  bodies are in better shape than the others. Subaru has a little  internal bleeding but will be fine in a week with the proper medicine.  Elio got pretty banged up from what was apparently a close range  blast... I think his face will scar lightly above his right eye.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...You didn't say anything about Tia?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Tia  fractured her entire right hand, wrist, and arm all the way to her  shoulder, which has severe muscle injury.” He sighed softly. “She won't  be able to use it for at least a month.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She's going to miss the mage test,” Nanoha looked down. “This is all my fault...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't  even start thinking like that right now. There are more important  things than some stupid test or you blaming yourself. You know that-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pointing  fingers won't solve any problems, I know, you've told me that before.”  With a sigh she leaned against him. “I'm sorry, I'm just trying to take  my mind off Fate... How long has she been in there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno looked  across the room towards the stairs. Shamal, not wanting to risk hurting  Fate by teleporting, had to take up the operation right there in their  house. “It's been almost an hour now. I don't know how long it will  take but seeing as how this is a pure magical healing I wouldn't think  much longer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The pony tailed girl looked to the side despite  seeing nothing but blackness wherever she turned. “She could get in a  lot of trouble for this couldn't she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More than you know.” A  new voice entered the room as Hayate nervously sat on the other side of  Nanoha. “If anyone found out she would have her license revoked and  probably serve jail time. The bill for restriction of magical healing  was passed for a reason: If you mess up even slightly on internal  organs or vital areas you could kill the person you are operating on or  leave them permanently disfigured. What we went through when younger is  highly looked down on now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno nodded lightly. “Yeah, but  right now we don't really have a choice do we?” To counteract his  statement the upstairs door opened up to reveal a shaky looking Shamal.  Instantly everyone ran over to her, including Nanoha who tripped over  the couch and had to have Yuuno show her the rest of the way. “Well?”  He asked timidly when she sat down on the steps with shaking hands.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She's fine,” Shamal eased their worries quickly. “She will have scars but she is fine...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate moved over and kneeled in front of the woman who doubled as her mother. “Are you okay? You look really pale.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Signum  chose to answer for her partner while leaning over to pick her up since  Shamal didn't look like she could walk anymore. “She's nervous. After  an operation like that, who wouldn't be? Come on, Shamal, you need to  rest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I want to see her.” Nanoha's words were more of a command than a request. “Yuuno-kun, take me there please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno  shook his head and guided Nanoha back to the couch. “She needs to  sleep, you know that.” Although she didn't give him a response she  still allowed herself to be sat down and returned to hugging his side  for comfort when he joined her. “Nanoha, can you answer a few things  for me?” He felt her nod and met Hayate's eyes for a little  encouragement before he continued. “When you were attacked... Did you  manage to talk to Skeith any?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha gripped him tighter. “No... She wouldn't answer...” Slowly she buried her head against him. “She's gone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno  put his arm around his friend and thought hard. “Tri-Edge's data drain  ability sucks not just magic but information and digital memory as well  so it can effect devices too-” his words froze in his throat, eyes  going wide. “That's it...<em>That's it!!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate was startled  at his sudden outbreak and in turn put her arm around Nanoha when she  moved away from the suddenly excited man. “<em>What's</em> it, Yuuno?” She watched him stand and start pacing, a sure sign he was on to something.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't you <em>see</em>!?”  He asked, amazed, while turning to walk in the other direction. “It's  all about information! Data! Electric signals and Astral Flow!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha blinked, moving from sad and worried to confused and annoyed. “Astral-what- now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate  answered before Yuuno could confuse her even more. “It's what we call  loading cartridges, when the compressed energy moves into something  besides the shell.” Turning to look back to Yuuno she went on. “But  what does that have to do with anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Data draining! Skeith!” He threw out his hands, smiling ear to ear. “It all makes sense now! We can beat them!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This did perk Nanoha's true interest. “Wait, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hayate!”  Yuuno moved over to her and looked down at the girl. “Remember our  original plan for Skeith? What we were going to do before Fate talked  her down?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um... Yes, you made some type of device to...” Her words stalled slightly before gasping. “The unison device you made!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>What</em> are you talking about!?” Nanoha finally cried out. “Someone tell me what's going on already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno  sat by her again and took her hands. “Nanoha, when you were first  controlled by Skeith, we made the discovery that she was a program. The  Jewel Seeds were originally like our devices except they were meant to  be worn as armor instead of used as weapons. This armor would allow  people to use perfect AI to become the best warriors ever.” he waited  for a small nod to continue. “When we found out that we could remove  Skeith's AI program from you and still leave the Jewel Seed grafted  onto your body, I made a device to do that. Using Rein as a base, I  created a type of gun that would literally suck all electronic data  from something and put it into a unison device. We were going to use it  to suck Skeith off you and then delete her information!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha slowly caught on to his plan. “So you're saying we could use that to get Skeith off Tri-Edge?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not only that...” Hayate ventured. “But if we timed it right, we could also take the Astral Flow with it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly!”  Yuuno pointed at her. “Thus not only would Nanoha get Skeith and  hopefully her vision back, but would also gain the power of a loaded  Linker Core and give Tri-Edge mana burn in the process!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are the odds of this working?” Signum asked as she walked into the room. “Sounds a little risky if you ask me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno  crunched the numbers in his head. “We would have to re-enforce the  device and do a little altering to create a unison device for it to  work...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The short leader of the group put a hand to her chin and  thought aloud. “True, the process of creating a Unison is extremely  difficult... We were originally planning for it to fail to dispose of  Skeith so we didn't really finish it properly...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha panicked at their words. “So you're telling me this could possibly kill Aura!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aura?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Skeith's  real name, I just don't use it much since I'm not used to it- wait  that's not the point!” She shook her head. “No, no way, I can't kill  her!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whoa, Nanoha, calm down girl.” Yuuno put his hands onto her shoulders. “Trust me; I'll make it work out. All right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly she looked down and nodded. “Okay... Promise me she won't be hurt?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Promise.” Yuuno got a confirming nod and turned to Hayate. “The device is on Mid-Childa, what should we do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  the two were sent here today to kill us that means they probably  wouldn't check in until they succeeded in doing so. Once their report  was late and they couldn't be contacted I think, logically, that the  people in charge would hold back to create a better plan on dealing  with us... So I say we should have about a week or two before we have  to worry about another attack.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But if we went back to  Mid-Childa we would cause attention to us...” Yuuno looked over at the  redhead in the room. “But you, you're not supposed to be here, so if  you return today no one would think twice about it...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Understood.”  Signum nodded over at him. “I can get the device and bring it back  here. Once Shamal is rested we can head back and get what's needed from  her offices.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In the mean time,” Yuuno kept talking to himself.  “I'm going to start re-planning.” Holding up his hand, he called forth  his book-type device. “I'm going to have a long few nights ahead of me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whoa!” Hayate stood up and grabbed the book. “You're injured! You need rest first!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hayate, I'm fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No you're not, your chest is almost bleeding through the bandages!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm a grown man, I can handle this!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't care, you are <em>not</em> going to work on this until your body has had time to heal, or at the  very least until Shamal can treat you a little! I command you to stay  here and rest!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As a civilian collaborator, I don't have to take your orders.” He reminded her</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm not telling you this as your superior, I'm telling you this as someone who cares about you deeply!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  whistled out loudly when a sudden silence came around them. “I would  have used the term 'friend', but apparently there's much more than that  here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A-anyway!” Hayate stammered, turning red and looking away  from everyone. “Yuuno, please rest for today. I'll help you tomorrow,  okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Fine.” He looked away as well, slipping one hand into  his front pocket and leaning a little to the side in a defeated pose.  “But you have to rest too, you were beaten pretty badly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I had  a barrier Jacket meant for combat, I'll be fine...” Her words trailed  off, glancing over her shoulder at the man. “We should really equip you  with a battle jacket instead of a normal one...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha sighed  out. “I want to get some sleep... Can one of you please get in touch  with Arisa and Suzuka and let them know we're okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah,” Signum nodded. “I'll get right on it.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Tia?”  Subaru's voice made the girl yelp softly in the semi-darkness of the  night. “Sorry,” She whispered softly as she made her way over to her.  “I woke up and you wasn't there so I came looking.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Idiot,” Tia scolded her affectionately. “I could have just been in the bathroom.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,  but after today I was worried...” The two held their breath when Nanoha  rolled over on the couch and resumed her loud snoring. Arf's puppy form  in turn walked around to reclaim her position on Nanoha's stomach and  also went back to sleep. “Shamal-san really made her sleep on the  couch?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She was just bruised and stunned, no real damage that  couldn't be fixed by Yuuno-san's healing magic.” Tia looked down at her  arm and tried unsuccessfully to move her fingers. “Unlike me...”  Sighing, she tried again to reach up and get a glass from the cabinet  with her left hand. She found Subaru's hand quickly next to hers to  stop a glass from tipping over and falling. “Dang it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here, let  me.” Subaru got the glasses and filled them both up with milk before  opening the cookie jar. “So,” she whispered again, a little louder this  time to be heard over the other girl's snores. “How is your arm? For  real now that no one else is around?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia bit into her  milk-logged cookie and chewed before answering. “It hurts. A lot.  Signum-san is supposed to be bringing me back some medicine from our  planet to numb the pain. Right now I am torn between screaming out and  ripping off my arm entirely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eep... That bad?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Know the feeling when your nose bleeds and dries up?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru made a face. “And it's all scratchy and gritty and you can feel it when you breathe?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm.  That's what my entire arm feels like... Yuuno-san told me I had  hair-line cracks running all down it and into my hand. I can <em>feel</em> it, it's really creepy.” She had to pause her talking when Nanoha moved  over onto her back and started what Fate had dubbed 'the chainsaw  snoring'. “Good god, no wonder Hayate-san sound-proofed their walls.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I just can't get over Nanoha-san actually doing what Shamal-san told her. She hasn't seen Fate-san since before her surgery.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can kind of understand, since she can't actually <em>see</em> her you know? Even if she was in the room with Fate-san, it wouldn't  help her any if she couldn't inspect to be sure she was okay. Speaking  of, I heard Shamal-san used all magic healing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can't tell  anyone.” She got a small nod. “Yes, Fate will be perfectly fine  tomorrow but will be weak and sore.” The two finished up their late  night snack and quietly made their way back to the room they shared.  “Speaking of being okay and stuff, are you really fine? You're limping  pretty bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,” Subaru touched her side gently. “My stomach  and ribs look horrible. Shamal-san and Yuuno-san had to do something to  it but I'm not really sure what because they put me to sleep.” She  slowly got into bed and exhaled lightly in pain. “Come on, let's get  some sleep.” She felt Tia get next to her and the two looked up at the  ceiling together a moment longer.”I'd put my arm around you but I can't  lean on my side.” The small joke made Tia actually giggle out in the  dark room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ahhh, go to bed you idiot.” they shared an awkward  positioned goodnight kiss and slid deeper under the covers to get  comfortable.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha  slowly woke up and blinked her eyes a few times before remembering  where she was. With a tender stretch to test her muscles she got off  the couch and wiped her face with her hand. “Anyone up yet?” She  inquired, greeted by silence. “Guess not,” She spoke aloud again before  heading towards the stairs by feeling around. Once at the wall she  trailed her fingers along it until the hand rail was found and slowly  walked up them once she got her bearings about where she was. Part of  her wondered if it was even morning yet, making her request Raising  Heart to give her the time. Now satisfied with hearing it was indeed  morning and the sun was up, she felt her way to her bedroom. “You awake  Sweetheart?” She asked the words timidly as she stuck her head in.  Truth be told she shouldn't be bothering her right now but Shamal was  no longer in the house so she had taken the chance to be with her  fiancée. “Fate?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,” The blond replied from the bed. “Been awake  for a while but my body doesn't really want to listen to me.” She gave  Nanoha a smile as she looked over at her. “Come here, just walk  straight.” Her lover did as she was told and reached out her hand to be  taken once she was half way there. “A little more...there we are.”  Carefully she urged Nanoha onto the bed and hugged her. “You have no  idea how happy I am right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You have no idea how worried I  was,” Nanoha replied in turn. “How could you think I was dead? Couldn't  you feel me?” The girl puffed out her cheeks in classic Nanoha style.  “And then going and hurting yourself on top of that! If you wasn't  injured I'd hit you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate's joy left instantly but she answered  anyway, having planned what she was going to say ever since she woke  up. “I'm sorry. I know I should have but... When I got to the forwards  their battle was already over. After that I came here and saw Yuuno and  Hayate already defeated. When I went to you, I just... I don't know, I  panicked. I was already too late twice and you wasn't moving... I'm  sorry.” She let her head fall lightly and looked at the bed instead of  at her fiancée.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate... Will you answer a question for me? Something I have been wanting to ask since I found out you were okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did you really...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Yes.” She closed her eyes sadly. “I snapped... I don't remember much of it...But enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know why.” Fate held her closer and almost started to cry. “Thinking that I lost you...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate,” Slowly Nanoha pulled back. “Did you stab yourself to win?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't ask me that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate,”  Their words were repeating, trying to find some way to make this go  about easier. “I'm very happy you are okay but...I'm disappointed at  what happened.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you mean?” Fate brought up her hand and  gently touched it to Nanoha's, frowning sadly when the hand was removed  from her reach slowly. “I disappointed you? How?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When something  happens you are always the first to sacrifice. Not just here but back  then...” She didn't have to say the words to imply that she was talking  about that snowy day years ago. “And when we were fighting against  Scaglietti... You never once thought about yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course not, Kitten, I was thinking of you...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know that but... But it worries me. I worry about you.” Moving her hand  back, she touched Fate's and found her still willing to hold hands even  after previously pulling away. “I have been thinking about this for a  while now but I never found the time to talk to you about it... Fate,  Darling, I think you have a problem.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you mean? Nanoha this is really sudden, first thing in the morning, and I had a horrible night last night and-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm sorry. This can't wait.” Nanoha took a breath. “Fate, I'm worried about our future together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The words jarred Fate enough to cut off any other protest she would have. “Okay, I'm listening.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  first noticed this when we were young.” Moving slightly, she sat next  to her fiancée and felt an arm being placed around her shoulders. “You  would always come to me just to make sure I was all right. Even after  simple things like long training, extra exercises, or even just simple  missions. I remember you would always make me dinner, rub my back, make  sure I was perfectly fine... but when you did them, you didn't do  anything but sleep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was tired,” Fate offered, a little confused. “I don't really see where this is going.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm  sorry, I 'm not really explaining this properly.” Nanoha took a breath  and thought. “You have always relied on me for as long as I can  remember. I don't mind, don't get me wrong, but it's gotten to a point  where I'm worried about your well being...If I'm away, I worry so much  about you it makes me sick.” She chuckled to herself in light humor.  “Poor Vita-chan always held my hair... That's not the point, though.  What I'm getting at is I'm scared to leave you alone for a while  because I'm worried you won't take care of yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“... Sweetheart, I eat just fine and keep the apartment spic-and-span. Am I missing something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, no, it's...it's... oh I can't say it without being blunt.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Be blunt, it's okay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate  I'm worried about you if something should ever happen to me. I...  really don't know what you will do. Whenever my life is threatened you  always disregard your own in order to do something rash... Teleporting  me to safety when that place was going to explode... Going Devil  Trigger and impaling yourself to get even with someone who hurt me...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love you, Nanoha, of course I would-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  love you too,” She cut her off softly. “I learned the hard way that you  would have to move on, when I thought you was dead. It's painful, so  very, very, painful. Just thinking back on it almost drives me to  tears...But I'm worried, if you was in that situation... what would you  do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I...I don't know... Nanoha... I know I'm a little too  reliant on you...Just knowing you're there gives me all the confidence  in the world, enough to actually take care of others as well.” Fate  looked over at the girl under her arm. “My decision to raise Elio, to  get Caro transferred, to start healing Lutecia... But thinking if you  were to ever not be there... It's too scary...I don't know what I'd do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is it because of when we were little?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You saved me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You saved yourself, I just offered my hand.” There was a small pause in the room. “Fate... Why do you love me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What? Nanoha, where on Earth did that come from?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Answer me please?” She looked up towards the blond's face. “Is it because I was the one who helped you back on your feet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!  No, no, at first maybe but no... Nanoha no. I love you because I love  you. I'll admit that one part of our lives made me start seeing you but  it was more, much more, that made me want to be with you... God, how  long were you worried over this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just last night when I was thinking about all of what was going on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  embraced Nanoha fondly. “Nanoha, I know I'm a little mentally off at  times... I had a bad childhood and I cling to you because of it. I  never knew it worried you like this, but for now on I'll try and be  better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Promise?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No more impaling yourself when you think I'm hurt or dead?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Trust me, I never want to go through that again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No throwing your life away if I'm not there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I won't. I will never do anything that upsets you purposely. But please understand that it will take time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know...I know, Fate.” The two gave each other another small squeeze  before Nanoha found the slight tears in her eyes being kissed away.  “Fate?” She got a soft hum. “Can we...Be together a little while?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“... Yes.” Ever so slowly she laid Nanoha back onto the bed and gently climbed on top of her. “I'm still a little sore so...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me too...so be gentle okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love you...” Leaning down, she kissed her fiancée softly.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“I'm  back.” Shamal greeted the house as she and Signum walked in through the  front door with several suitcases. “How is everyone?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio looked up  from the couch and turned his left eye over towards them. “I'm okay, I  suppose.” Despite his words the patch covering his right eye said  otherwise. “Caro-hime and Lulu haven't woken up yet.” Hopping off the  couch, he went over to help the two women pull in all the luggage.  “Subaru and Tia are in their room watching the television I think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hayate  and Yuuno?” She pondered as they sat down what they were carrying on  the living room table. “I have to go back to Mid-Childa shortly so I  want to be sure everyone is okay first.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio thought about it. “I think I saw Yuuno-san and Hayate-san leave for breakfast this morning so I don't think they are home.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shamal nodded to herself. “That only leaves the other two. Assuming they are awake since Nanoha isn't on the couch?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I heard them talking in their room so I didn't bother them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shamal  thanked the boy and walked up the stairs to make her rounds before  heading back home. The two Stars members were treated quickly with  their follow up exam and given pills to take for the pain and suffering  they were going through. Following along, she walked down the hall and  raised her hand to knock on the door leading to the bunny couple's  room. Just before her knuckles rapped against the wood she heard a  repressed gasp and repeating of names. Normally she would simply blush  and leave them be, obvious to what they were doing, but after just  being treated she could only think one thing: They were going to hurt  themselves.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The door opened quickly, startling the two girls  apart and quickly covering themselves up. “Nanoha! Fate!” Shamal  started in instantly. “You two almost <em>died</em> yesterday! You should both be resting! I made Nanoha sleep on the couch for a reason you know! I expected more from you two! I <em>told</em> you not to stress your bodies!” Looking over at Nanoha, she let loose  again. “With your body being the way it's in, and Fate having to be  healed magically, you should know better! Can I not leave you alone for  ten hours without you going against what I told you to do?!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate opened one eye and looked over at Nanoha sideways “<em>Ha ha, you're getting scolded</em>,”  She sent to her lover telepathically before Shamal turned on her as  well and started going off about taking better care of herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  sudden laughing at the door made all three turn to look towards the  noise. Subaru stopped giggling all at once and flushed all the color  from her face. “Um, sorry” She told them lamely. “I was just passing by  and...okay, I'm going now.” Quickly she limped away from the door, huge  smile still on her face. '<em>Oh man, I'm not going to forget this for a looooooong time.</em>'</span></p>

Yuuno: The device is taking a little longer than I thought it would, I will need another week at the earliest to finish it.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha: It can't be helped, you're going out of your way to ensure that we will be okay, after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate: Come on everyone, time for training!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru: I can barely move...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro: I don't think I can walk...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio: My body won't listen to me...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha: Come now, we can't slack off because we almost died, we need to prepare for the mage test!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia: Next time on Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha's 6th Division: Moving Toward Our Goal.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate: Yuuno, there's something I want to talk to you about...</span></p>

Author's  Notes: Sometimes things don't work out the way you want them to. The  entire ending with Nanoha and Fate was completely different in my first  draft. I re-wrote all of it to better fit the story, that's why it took  so long for this chapter. Speaking of, we're winding down to the end of  Redemption. If you want to know about updates, progress, or anything  else with me you can always check out the forums at animesuki dot com.
