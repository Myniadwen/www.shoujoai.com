<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It all started the moment we met so  very, very long ago. You were my enemy, my rival, my opponent. I  wanted nothing more than to overcome you and take what I wanted so I  would be accepted by my mother. But you, you didn't want to fight me,  didn't want to hurt me. You wanted to be my friend, to help me, to  touch me. In time I understood that and allowed you to reach out your  hand and save me from my self contained hell. I owe you my life, as  without you I would not be truly alive today. You stood up for me and  worked with the people to help me be set free into the world that I  had never enjoyed before. You taught me something then, on that day  on the bridge; what friendship was. We exchanged ribbons and our  fingers touched. Something sparked in my chest then and I wanted to  tell you but I didn't, and I don't know why.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We sent video letters to each other  constantly for the next few months. Each one filled my heart with joy  and I still have them all in order in my room even today. You showed  me things about the world, introduced me to new friends, gave me  something to strive to see. It started slowly, as I didn't really  understand it myself, but my feelings for you were growing. I would  listen to your voice alone in my room and smile. You were there for  me, even if we were so far apart, and that was what I had craved all  my life. You accepted me. My heart ached to see you. I wanted to tell  you so badly but I didn't, and I don't know why.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Meeting again wasn't like either of us  had anticipated. After so long we were re-united, only to be split up  again so soon. The battle was hard on me, as I was so very, very  worried. But we overcame, and we were able to talk again. Our second  hug. I held you close in that small room and everything I had built  up over the past few months threatened to escape all in that one  moment. I could have told you then, those strange feelings, but I  held it back and I don't know why.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elementary school, middle school,  junior high, High school...We went through them together, along with  the group of friends we made along the way. I discovered what it was  like to be normal, to simply have a life and the worries that came  along with it. People noticed us; we got several love letters in our  lockers each month. But I didn't care about them and neither did you.  With respect to their feelings we always replied in person the same  answer: we were not looking for a relationship right now. Deep inside  I was lieing. I knew then what I didn't so long ago. I wanted you; to  hold you, to kiss you, to feel you.  Always together but never the  way I wanted. Countless times we were in the situation, you looking  up at me with those eyes, and it would have been the perfect time to  say the words in my heart...but I didn't, and I don't know why.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno became your boyfriend and to be  honest I was happy for you two, despite the pain in my heart I felt  whenever you two would laugh together. Everyone said you were the  perfect couple but I didn't agree. Even though I knew I wouldn't be  the best for you, even though I knew Yuuno would give his life for  you, I knew one thing: No one could love you as much as I could.  Throughout your dates, your emotional roller coasters, your good and  bad times, I was there for you. Always smiling, always caring, always  loving. Your eyes sought out mine and gazed at me as if wanting  something. The words never left my mouth, and I don't know why.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Your wedding was amazing, filled with  many, many friends. People were crying, people were cheering, people  were laughing. The perfect couple was now a family. I cried the most  that day, both out of happiness and sadness. He would treat you  right, would love you until the world ended, and would make you so  very happy. Despite this I couldn't help but know I could as well.  When you told me about the engagement you held my hands and had  looked deep into my eyes with that searching look that was always  there. I wished you the best of luck, and I don't know why.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Now you were gone and again people were  gathered. No one was smiling now, only tears for the girl who had  died at the young age of twenty-four. My world was shattered, my  heart broken, my tears not stopping. Slowly people began to give  small speeches while standing in front of your coffin, each one  mentioning your smile, your kind words, your ever present laugh. My  words were the shortest of all, even though I knew you the best. The  emotions I felt, the way you touched my life, could not be spoken  with mere sentences.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then, just before you would be lowered  into the ground on that hill facing the sunrise, Hayate stood up and  faced everyone after placing a rose along with the many already  there. The leader of our unit held a small book that I knew to be  your diary and said that in your memory she would read a passage from  it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I see you every day both in my  dreams and while I'm awake. Even when you are away I know we are  connected in our minds. I love you so much, from the very bottom of  my heart. You are the one that means the most to me and I would give  anything just to see you smile. Every morning I wake up and hope that  this would be the day. The day you finally tell me the words I want  to hear, the day we can truly love each other. I look at you,  searching desperately for some type of sign, and get the same smile I  always do. I want you to tell me but you never do, and I don't know  why.</em></span></p>

Author's  notes: This was originally going to be an SNL chapter but after seeing  it... I just thought it was too powerful to be placed there, despite  this being so short. I hope this story touched you.<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><br />
