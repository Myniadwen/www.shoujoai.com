<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was never  one to wait impatiently for a phone call because normally it meant that  someone was hurt in one way or another. This time, however, I have been  waiting for three days while holding my breath every time a monitor  appeared in front of me. The moment I finished taking photos of  Nanoha's eyes and released her from in infantry I contacted one of my  friends who specialized in visual care. Ironically it was the same  person who I spoke to when getting Nanoha's glasses made. Back then I  only gave him the prescription since she refused to let me do anything  other than get her what she needed. I was told he would examine the  pictures for me and tell me more details as soon as he could. Although  honestly I wanted him to get back to me in a day's time or so because I  was extremely worried but I also knew that he was a busy man and was  already going out of his way for me. With a sigh I closed my eyes and  took a long drink of the hot spiced tea in my mug. A familiar beeping  sound caught my attention and I turned to look at the floating monitor  next to me, displaying the name 'Claude C. Kennedy'. It took everything  to not spill my drink on myself when I hastily went to answer the call.  “Claude-kun!” I greeted, barely containing myself. “Do you have any  news about the patient I sent images of?” I felt bad for not greeting  him properly but Nanoha was already gone to Earth now and the time I  had to make sure she was ready for battle again was already wearing  thin.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By: Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Claude  smiled without humor. “Shamal-kun, you said that this girl was recently  blinded in an attack?” After getting a nod he continued while sending  several images towards the female at the same time. “Yes, it has  confused all of us. I had to get a second and third opinion, we've  never seen anything like this before.” On the woman's side several  monitors appeared around her, each displaying some of the images and  X-rays of Nanoha's eyes. “What you sent me clearly revealed damaged  rods and cones, the very things that makes the eye perceive color and  light. However... It also shows that this has been damaged for several  years now, not recently done.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But she could see just fine up until this incident?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  that's what you said in your report and that's what confused all of us.  You see, right here,” A specific image went in front of both of them  and he pointed. “This shows that the cones are dead, having been  destroyed. There is scar tissue around them, but at the same time,  there is something else, something we can't place. Compare your patient  to a healthy eye,” Several more images came up. “Notice anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shamal  leaned forward, observing. “Yes, Nanoha-chan's eyes have some type of  fog all over them... I thought that was just my equipment?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  this is something that none of us have ever seen. It's highly resembles  magical healing on eyes, which you know was banned by the health  government because of the risk of causing brain damage...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn't do anything,” She defended herself. “I don't even know <em>how</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wasn't implying you was, I was just saying,” Claude soothed her. “The  point is, this girl has been blind for several years. Whatever allowed  her to see seems to be gone now, as if it was moved away from her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Moved...”  Shamal went silent a moment, recalling the operation on her. “...The  Jewel seed moved inside her body...” She gasped. “Back then, when she  was healed!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm sorry?” The man looked confused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's a  dreadfully long story, and classified top secret... Can I ask for you  to stay quiet about this from now on? Don't let anyone else know  please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Okay, Shamal-kun. I'll cover myself, should I keep investigating?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  please, by all means... I will as well, I'll contact you as soon as I  find out something. But tell me this, if she stays the way she is, will  she recover normally?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's a miracle she could see at all, so unless the miracle comes back I'm sorry to say she will be blind for life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...I see, thank you for your time. I'll get you a budget increase for helping me...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shamal-kun,  this girl obviously means a lot to you. I don't need a bribe to  continue researching this. All you need to do is ask.” He smiled at  her. “I'll stay in touch.” With that the screen cut off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  doctor put her forehead against her palm and leaned forward. “She lost  her vision back then...Skeith was allowing her to see by grafting  herself into her eyes... If the jewel seed is no longer able to do  that...Does that mean it died while trying to heal Nanoha during the  operation? Or maybe just out of magic?” Shamal bit her thumbnail on her  free hand. “The only way to know is to get her to phase shift into her  Skeith form but not even Nanoha can do that on her own; she has to have  her life threatened before Skeith awakens inside her... This just got a  lot more complicated.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“I'm really not enjoying this,” Nanoha spoke up as she gripped Fate's hand tighter. “I'm really, <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">really</span></em> not enjoying this...” They were sitting on a bus and for the first time  Nanoha had absolutely no idea of even the general area where she was.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It'll be okay Sweetheart,” Fate soothed her as best she could. “You'll feel better once we get to Suzuka's house.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where are we?” She asked for the tenth time since they boarded the bus.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ummm,  almost there, we've been out of the city for a bit now so it shouldn't  be too much longer.” Fate looked out the window. “Actually, I see her  house, we're going to get off in just a moment.” Just as she started,  Hayate reached up and pushed the request stop button. The vehicle  slowed down as per request and soon stopped outside of the gates  leading to the mansion. “Come on, let's get off.” Standing, she allowed  both of her hands to move behind herself and felt each one being taken  by her friend. “Stepping down, three times. There you go.” As soon as  the bus took off she allowed Nanoha to stand beside her and felt very  proud of her for not clinging at her side like she thought would  happen. “Wow, havn't been here for a while have we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You said it,” Yuuno replied absently. “I keep forgetting how rich our friends are...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have  I ever mentioned I feel awful doing things like this?” Hayate pondered  aloud as she pushed the intercom button next to the gate. Seconds  passed before she pushed it again, this time getting a response. “We're  friends of Suzuka-chan,” She spoke into the device. “We're here on a  surprise visit.” The gate opened to them and the four made their way  down the long driveway. “Walking for five minutes just to reach the  door. I wonder if I'll ever get a house like this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A forward room is all I need,” Yuuno spoke his thoughts aloud.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha laughed at that. “Yeah but you stay at everyone else's place all the time so it doesn't really matter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,” Hayate came to his defense. “I invite him over all the time, he's not just lounging.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,  sure,” Fate smirked at her friend, getting a quick blush before Hayate  turned on her. “I wonder what she will say when we get there?” Upon  reaching the door they only had to knock once before it was opened by a  maid. The small group was ushered in and only had to wait a few moments  before a startled cry met their ears. “Suzuka!” Fate smiled brightly at  her friend and opened her arms when she was ran to and hugged. “I  missed you too!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you doing here?” She asked happily, quickly going to the others for a hug as well. “It's been half a year! And oh my <em>god</em>, Fate you cut your hair!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Some things have come up,” Hayate told her nervously. “We're half here on business, half for fun...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We'll  get to business later!” She waved it off. “I understand how hard it  must be sometimes. Nanoha, stop standing there, come hug me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...  How about you come hug me instead?” She asked, a smile still on her  face as she held out her arms. “Come on!” Her wish was granted and the  two life long friends gripped each other tightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How are you?” She asked her softly. “Staying out of trouble right? Nothing dangerous?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  thought back on the question. The abduction of her forward along with  the forest set up. Matching it came her almost breaking Fate's neck  while she hung herself. To top it off they had done a mission with a  two percent chance of survival. Fate was thought dead and ended up  losing all her memories for a while. Finally she had her butt kicked by  some un-known assassin who was trying to kill them all. “Nothing out of  the ordinary,” She told her friend shyly. “But there's one small  thing...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” She seemed to lose the cheerfulness at the sudden silence. “Nanoha? You're scaring me, what's wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She's blind,” Fate whispered, feeling her heart tighten at the sudden shock on her friend's face. “For a few days now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please  don't make a big deal,” Nanoha asked of her friend as she was hugged  again. “I can handle this as long as I don't have to repeat the same  thing over and over and over...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, okay.” Her voiced sounded as if she was anything <em>but</em> okay with not asking her questions. “You said half business? Is something going on?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually...” Hayate began, looking ashamed at what she was about to ask.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Is this it?” Subaru pondered as they looked at the two story house in front of them. “It's big...”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-san  said they used it as a base for several years for any activity  happening around this area. Actually, didn't she say that she lived  here for a long time?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio nodded. “I've been here before, we  used it as a summer house for vacation time.” Walking up to the house  he kneeled down and lifted a small fake rock to take out a key from  under it. “There's a special way to get in, to protect it from being  robbed while it's not in use,” He explained to them, slipping in the  key and pressing his palm against the large doorbell. After a moment  the door clicked open and allowed them entrance. “A key to turn on the  program and once activated it swaps to Midchilda style locks.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  hand scanner,” Tia mused, inspecting it. “This planet is only bottom  mid-level technologically right? This kind of thing isn't normal around  here is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,” He agreed as they walked in. “Wow, it's amazingly clean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  I cleaned up,” A new voice stated, making everyone turn to a small girl  with dog ears and tail. “You got here sooner than I thought, I was  napping and heard you come in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Arf-san!” Caro and Elio ran forward to greet the child excitedly. “How have you been!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Great,”  Arf hugged the each in turn before greeting the others, who she had  only met twice before. Despite having to ask Lutecia's name again she  still welcomed the purple haired one into the house and started leading  them. “This is really just a summer house used for gatherings, so make  yourself right at home since you're not 'invading' anyone's house.” She  pointed around. “Kitchen is over there, living room here, obviously,  over there is a half-bath. Dining room through there,” She moved her  small hand as she spoke, guiding them to the stairs. “I'll show you  your rooms for now so you ca get unpacked. Fate's room is here, Stars  members here next to it, Lightning is here, and Hayate's is across the  hall.” The puppy-girl crossed her arms and nodded to herself. “You can  stick to that or change if you wish. Sorry to crowd you like that but  we're jamming several people in this house. Lindy is coming as well so  probably end up using the fold down couch as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Cramped, as al<em>ways</em>.” Elio clamped his hand over his mouth quickly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See!?” Subaru declared while pointing at him. “His voice cracked again!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It did <em>not</em>” Elio protested, falling prey to his voice squeaking again. “Ugh...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw, Elio is becoming a man!” Tia leaned over and grinned at him. “Congratulations.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio looked away in embarrassment. “Don't read too far into it...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru put a finger to her chin. “But isn't eleven years old too early for that? He just had his birthday...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Arf laughed. “Guess he matures fast for his age.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio  walked into a room and flicked the switch on. “Many memories here...”  He spoke aloud, trying to change the topic onto anything but him  hitting puberty.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro followed him in along with Lutecia. “How  many times have you been here?” She pondered, liking the chance to  learn something new about her knight.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably been here a good  two months total. Few days here, few days there. Lots of swapping  before a steady home.” he tossed his duffel bag down and started  unloading it into the empty drawers. “As Arf-san said, no one lives  here so everything is empty. Claim a spot and go with it. I'll sleep on  the floor you two can have the bed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!” Caro instantly countered him. “Elio can have the bed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro-hime...”  He was going to protest but Lutecia eyed him, clearly telling him her  thoughts before he could speak his own. “...How about we take turns...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Across  the hall Tia looked around the empty room after dropping her bag onto  the ground. “Not too shabby,” She mused. “About the same size as the  forward rooms really, maybe a little smaller, but for a actual one  person room it's really nice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, a water bed!” Subaru yelled out, startled as she fell back onto it. “How cool!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ugh, I'm never going to get any sleep.” Tia face-palmed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why is that?” She wondered as she made waves and giggled as her body rocked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because you can't stay still for a minute when sleeping and I'm going to get seasick from the motion...”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“And  that brings us up to today,” Hayate finally finished and allowed  herself to drink from the teacup in front of her for the first time  since she began telling the story. “So we decided on Earth instead of a  T.SA.B alliance planet. We wanted to see everyone again even if it  meant being in a tight spot for a while.” She gave Suzuka a small  helpless smile. “Could you possibly collaborate with us again for a  short time? I promise you'll get more than you invest!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hayate-chan!”  Suzuka looked offended. “You know good and well I don't need anything  in return! What can I do for you? Lodging? Need money? Transpiration?  All of the above?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I would love to stay with you but even if the  risk of us being tracked here are less than one percent we can't take  that chance...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The purple haired girl waved it off. “Don't  worry, you can't stay here but we can still be together as long as  you're not seen going in and out of my house at night, got you. Well  then, let's get this out of the way so we can have fun.” Reaching into  her purse, she took out her checkbook. Her pen hovered slightly above  the pages. “Actually...” Looking up she smiled. “This could actually  work out really well for me. You see, I'm planning on going into  college soon but the best places for engineering aren't in Japan. I  need to learn a new language and once you go so far you have to fly  anyway to come back home...” Her voice trailed off with a light smile  on her lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What, come to Midchilda?” Nanoha asked quickly. “But your family, your friends, your-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My  family isn't home much you know that Nanoha-chan. As for my friends, my  only close one is Arisa-chan and she wants to move there as well. I  want to reclaim you four as my close friends again, no more of this  seeing each other three times in... how many years?” Suzuka frowned. “I  miss you. All of you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate softened, moving over to hug her. “We  miss you too, but the paperwork and things needed... and your money  can't transfer because this isn't a T.S.A.B governed planet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate  finally caught what was going on. “You want to trade money with us on  earth for Midchilda credit don't you!?” She received a peace sign,  making Hayate laugh. “And as a collaborator your terms are permission  for you and your friend to move to our planet?” Again another happy  nod. “Mou... What am I going to do with you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Preferably say I can transfer a lot of money so I can get a good start on a new planet.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Five  thousand dollars?” Yuuno asked in shock as he got in the passenger seat  of the van. “Hayate, how in the world are you going to write that off!?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  brown haired girl laughed, getting in to drive after touching the door  handle before Fate could to claim it. “Government gives a certain  amount of money for issued protection and since we're all military it's  higher. Add in the fact there are nine of us and we have a large amount  we can draw from. That and the fact that a twelve pack of soda cost  almost five dollars here and only two on Midchilda, she basically  doubled her investment. She won't be rich anymore but she will have  more than enough to move and start her college on Midchilda... Although  the sheer amount of paperwork I'm going to have to do to allow the  transfer is already giving me a headache.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anyway, where to now? Arisa won't be home until late tonight.” Nanoha thought aloud. “Back to the house?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't  you want to see your family?” Yuuno turned around to look at the couple  in the middle row of seats. “It's been half a year since you two last  saw them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha turned her head, appearing as if she was gazing out the van window. “We have more important things to set up right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate closed her eyes a moment before speak. “Hayate, head to Nanoha's house. Drop us off please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate, I <em>just</em> said-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha  be quiet.” Fate spoke firmly. “We're going and that's final. I'm not  going to let you avoid your family after you told me not a week ago  that you wanted to ask for leave time to see them again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No buts. It will be hard at first but after it's over and you can be with them every day while we're here it will be worth it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate  smiled to herself, driving them back into town. “I guess that's what  they call 'tough love' huh?” In the back seat she heard Nanoha mutter  something about Fate being mean. “Those two... I swear, they never  change do they?” Several minutes passed by in comfortable silence with  the radio filling in for the lack of conversation. After what seemed  like no time at all Hayate pulled up to Nanoha's old house and looked  at it with fond memories of after school snacks and sleepovers. “We're  here. Should we pick you two up later after everything is situated?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  looked over at Nanoha and gripped her shaking hand. “We'll probably end  up staying the night. I can use Bardiche to contact you at the house  since it has the M2D installed, I have the frequency stored already.  Take care of things for me all right? Tell Arf that I'll spend tomorrow  with her as well if you would?” She got two nods before the sliding  door opened, allowing the two to slip out of the van and look at the  quiet house. “Nanoha, sorry to do this to you, but you'll thank me, I  promise.” The brown haired girl nodded her head nervously and  swallowed. “Wow you look really nervous...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Gee Fate, telling my  family that worries about me all the time about being military that  'Hey! I'm suddenly blind and helpless but still going to work there!'  wouldn't make anyone at all nervous would it!?” She shook as she heard  the van pulling away. “Fate I can't do this; I just can't! I can deal  when I don't have to talk about it but when people start asking  questions it just hits me all over again and-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shhh,” Putting an  arm around the girl she lead her to the gate and through it. “You can't  avoid your family Honey.” Reaching up she rang the doorbell.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  hate you...” She was already starting to cry. “Fate how can you do this  to me...?” Before the blond could reply the door opened and the  familiar voice of her mother greeted the two. All at once she was  pulled into a hug and was fussed over happily. “Mom,” She couldn't  continue, instead hugging her mother closer and trying not to cry.  Momoko looked over at Fate questioningly a moment before getting an  answer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can we come in? Everyone needs to be together for this.”  Fate was ushered inside while Nanoha still clung to her mother. “Hello,  Shiro-san.” She bowed lightly to the older man before getting a hug for  herself. “Sorry to drop by unannounced.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're <em>always</em> welcome!” He told her happily. “What brings you two to this planet?  Hey, What's wrong with Nanoha?” Moving over to the two females he  hugged his daughter. “Nanoha?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um,” Fate got their attention back on her. “Miyuki-san and Kyoya-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At  the coffee shop,” Momoko guided Nanoha over to the couch and gave her  an odd look when she stumbled after almost tripping over the small  table. “Did something happen?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate, seeing her lover about to  lose anything she had left, took the matter into her own hands. “Well,  you see, Long story short we turned down a merger offer with some  really cruel people. After this they sent assassins after us to be sure  we couldn't be used against them if we weren't going to be <em>with</em> them,” Holding up her hand, she cut off any interruptions. “Nanoha  fought one of them and well... lost. She was hit by an attack and as a  result she lost her vision.” The silence that hung in the air was thick.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  spoke first as she pulled away from Momoko. “I'm making it all right,”  She told them as she tried her best to steady herself. “My friends are  there with me and-” She was cut off by a sudden hug again from both  parents. Several words mixed together and questions running in on each  other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um!” Fate spoke loudly to get them to look at her again.  “Please, I know it's hard but let me answer the questions for you.  Nanoha get upset when she has to talk about it... I don't want to see  her cry...”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Tell me  we're not lost.” Subaru requested as she and Tia walked down the  streets of the unfamiliar city. When nothing came to her call she  looked over at the orange haired girl seemed nervous. “Oh great...”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We're not lost!” Tia denied furiously. “We can call and get directions back!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Our devices rely on the M2D for communications between each other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then we'll contact the M2D at the house!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did you store the frequency number while we were there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia looked dejected a moment before trying again. “We can ask for directions to the house itself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't know the address, do you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're not helping!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru winced. “Don't yell at me...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With a sigh the gunslinger looked around. “Sorry, I'm just annoyed. I <em>told</em> them I didn't want to go shopping. We don't even know what a few of these things <em>are</em>.  Seriously... Why didn't they just let the Lightning members do it,  Lutecia asked Elio on a date anyway.” The girl looked down at the  plastic bag she was carrying and sighed once again. “I felt so  embarrassed having to ask a clerk for the items. He looked at us like  we were stupid and when we told him we weren't originally from this  planet it only got worse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her partner laughed uneasily. “Sorry,  I forgot that this place didn't have inter-planet transportation.”  Looking around some more she grinned. “Hard to believe that three Aces  of the T.S.A.B all came from this run-down little planet isn't it?” The  two shared a laugh at the thought. “Hey look! A cake shop!” Without  waiting for a response Subaru ran ahead and looked in the window.  “Midori café huh?” She mused at the different things in the window.  “Tia-Tia! Let's have some!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru, you know we shouldn't. We  will have lunch when we get back to the house and besides, eating too  much strange food will give you a tummy ache.” They didn't even have  any earth money as it was anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's cake, it's not foreign!” She protested. “We have similar things on Midchilda it can't be <em>that</em> different!” Moving to walk into the store she smiled at her friend.  “Besides, what could go wrong with a little cake?” Just as she pushed  open the door three figures turned around and ran at her with knives.  Her body acted before her mind even took in the situation by grabbing  the first man's arm to lead the knife away from her vital points. With  a slight turn she threw him over her shoulder and onto the ground  before slamming her fist into his stomach roughly. “What the hell!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They  just robbed the store!” One of the people cried out as a male from  behind the counter leapt over the separator and over to them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subdue  him I'll get the others!” Tia darted out the door and gave chase to the  two men running from her. “Stop running!” She warned them as cross  mirage came to her right hand. “Last chance! Stop running or you'll be  persecuted to the full extent of the law!” The two men continued to run  from her despite the protest. '<em>Ugh, fine we'll do it the hard way.</em>'  The gunslinger doubled her pace as she pushed through the streets  crowded with people. The two seemed to be running almost side by side  but still one of them was starting to fall behind slightly. With the  slower one in sight a plan formed inside of her head. Leaning forward  she prepared herself before jumping and used a boost from what little  flight she could muster. Her barrier Jacket flared to life as she went  on the offensive, one foot lashing out and catching the man on the back  of his knee. Tia grabbed the back of the man's head as he fell and went  with him, slamming his forehead onto the concrete and rendering him  unconscious. Not stopping there she sprang into a forward flip from her  one handed cartwheel and landed her her feet once again. “I'll shoot if  you don't stop!” Her words clearly scared the man as the gun trained on  him. “Cross mirage, civilian mode!” She received a confirmation and  narrowed her eyes, firing once. The man fell all as the stunning bullet  slammed into his back. Once she caught up to him she slid down and  grabbed the back of his neck to haul him to his feet. “Just had to run  didn't you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What's going on here?” A uniformed policeman ran  onto the scene and looked at the girl holding a man. Seeing her weapon  he pulled his own and trained it on them. “Stand with your hands above  your head.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“These people robbed a store.” Tia told him casually  as she holstered her gun at her waist. “There's one more behind me and  another at the store itself, my partner has him.” Reaching back, she  took out Cross Mirage's card and showed him her I.D. “Tiana Lanster of  Riot Force Six here on vacation.” Before he could fully inspect the  card she flipped it shut and slid it into her pocket. “I'll show you  back to the other, can you handcuff them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru looked up as  Tia entered the café and waved to her. “Ya-ho! Get them both?” She  seemed happy despite what had just happened. “Tia-Tia, they offered us  all the cake we could eat for stopping them, isn't that great!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop  with the pet names,” She protested lightly as the officer cuffed the  third and final man. Seeing the man who had given chase she tossed him  the bag of money. “Here, It's all I saw on them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” He  looked in it and nodded. “Looks like all of it. Sorry, I was going to  try and stop them myself but I was afraid they would hurt some of the  people here...” His eyes looked to the side where a few elderly people  were sitting, obviously shaken from the ordeal. “Please, stay and have  something to eat?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I could go for a drink if you don't mind? Oh!  And if you could, could you give us directions? We're kind of lost...”  Tia scratched her cheek and left it to the man to get them their  request after putting the money back into the cash register. His female  work partner wrapped the rest up with the police before coming over to  them as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello,” She greeted them with a small bow. “Thank  you very much for the help.” The two tried to wave it off as part of  their job. “You two are police?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Military,” Subaru told her without thinking about it. “We're the forwards of Riot Force Six under Nanoha Takamachi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  girl gasped. “Section Six!? Nanoha!?” She pointed at them, trying hard  to remember their names. Having only met them once before it took her a  moment to recall the information. “Subaru-san and Tia-san!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  clicked for both of them at the same time. “Miyuki-san!?” The orange  haired one spoke first, getting a nod. “Midori Café... Nanoha's  family's store... What are the odds...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Apparently really good.”  Kyoya joined in, setting down a plate that had several sampler pieces  of cake as well as iced tea for both of them. “What are you two doing  here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Miyuki nodded. “And is Nanoha here as well!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two looked at each other, wondering just how much they should reveal.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha  sat down on the bed slowly, keeping the towel around herself just under  her arms. Her hair was still damp, also kept in a folded turban type  deal with a bright yellow towel as well. “Fate?” She asked softly,  getting a small hum. “What are you doing?” She knew the answer but  asked it anyway in an attempt to break the ice.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Installing the M2D  device for this house,” She replied absently while looking at the  instructions. “Yuuno was supposed to do it but was caught up at our  house so I'm doing it instead.” After nodding to her self she pushed a  few more buttons on the suitcase sized box. “I think this should  work... We will be able to route the transmission through patrolling  warships and contact Midchilda now but there will be a five to ten  second delay and bad signal quality. At least that's what Yuuno said.  At least while we're here we can contact the house and back any time we  want with no ill effects.” She closed the device and slid it under the  bed before raising her hands up. “Computer, display main menu.” To her  call a screen came in front of her requesting the specifics of the  house and profiles. “Good, I'll show Momoko how to handle this later  on. Computer, close windows and set up upon next opening.” A small beep  greeted her and she sat on the bed behind her fiancée. “How was your  bath?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Horrible,” She spoke softly, rubbing her hands together.  “Mom freaked out about my injuries and I tried to hide the scars on my  back but she saw them anyway. I hate when they worry about me. I'm a-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tough  cookie,” Fate finished for her with a smile. “They will learn that  eventually don't worry.” Moving around, she placed her hands on  Nanoha's shoulders and removed the towel. “They are healing nicely  actually. I packed the healing bandages I requested from Shamal, so let  me wrap you up right fast okay?” Without getting a reply Nanoha simply  lifted her arms. Fate slowly moved them around Nanoha's body and  snipped the end to snap it together. “There, it's a little cold I'm  sure, but stick with it okay?” She was answered in silence again,  making her nervously try and bring up a new topic. “So, here we are on  Earth again... want to get some ice cream tomorrow?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate,” The word came out softly but it was enough to make the blond stop rambling. “I'm sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  said such a hateful thing to you.” Closing her eyes, she looked down.  “Now that I'm here and have been with my family for a while...Even  though it was hard at first and the hugs my brother and sister gave me  really hurt... I'm glad I did it... so glad... I was going to stay here  the entire time and not let them know I was hurt but... You know me so  well and forced me here even though you knew I would be mad at you for  it... and I said that earlier... I'm sorry. I love you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know,” Fate sat down next to her and placed an arm around the girl's shoulders. “You was just upset-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That's not the point!” Her words got harder, once again making Fate go silent. “I said such a bad thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's  not the first time either of us said that, silly.” Fate comforted her  with a gently squeeze. “Remember that time when we first started living  together and I was so mad at you for leaving your stuff everywhere  after I just finished cleaning? And you were mad at me because I picked  out curtains and matching things without consulting you?” Nanoha smiled  to herself at the memory. “I threw that pillow at you and you tossed  one back and we ended up screaming at each other how it wouldn't work  out living together... Oh man that sucked. I slept on the couch that  night and we both said we hated each other before turning out the  lights... And what happened the next morning?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was the first  time I made you breakfast,” Nanoha recalled it. “And we apologized for  what we did...you took back what you bought even though I said not  to...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And the world goes on and we got closer for it, huh?” Fate leaned over and kissed Nanoha's cheek.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate...  I'm so sorry. I'm fine one moment and the next I break down and you  comfort me just to do it over again. I'm like a broken record but I  don't mean to be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shush. I understand. Just tell me anything you want to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha leaned over against her. “Am I unfit to take care of Caro-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  the enforcer shook her head despite Nanoha not being able to see her.  “For various reasons that I could list off but you wouldn't really  listen to them anyway right now. Just know that you wouldn't be a bad  mother. You being worried about it is proof enough.” A small silence  passed by yet again. “Anything else?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The brown haired girl shook  her head. “No, I'm okay. I want to get over this, it's been a few days  now already. Let's get some sleep?” She felt her hair be freed and  finger combed lightly. “Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'll get your night shirt,  lift your arms up?” Nanoha did as requested and was clothed a few  moments later. The covers were pulled back and the two slid under them,  curling up against each other. “You know,” Fate spoke up again. “We  don't cuddle near enough in bed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because you always move away from me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because you snore.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  smiled to herself, for once not denying it. “I love you Fate.” She  heard her friend reply in kind and closed her eyes, drifting off  peacefully in the rare treat of being embraced from behind.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Elio  yawned loudly as he stretched out on the couch. “I'm turning in,” He  announced to the large group of people in the living room. Several  people waved at him before turning their attention back to the  conversation at hand. The young male walked to the stairs and went up  them while suppressing another yawn. Upon reaching the room he was  staying in he opened the door and stepped though it lazily. In front of  him he saw Lutecia standing in only a pair of purple panties with a  nightshirt above her head in mid dressing. “Ah...” His mind stopped  briefly, knowing he should leave but finding his eyes dropping against  his will to take in her body for a few precious seconds before she was  covered properly. “Sorry... I should have knocked... or something...”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't mind,” She told him as she sat on the bed and looked out the window. “It's healthy for a boy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Closing the door he stepped into the room. “But still... sorry. I thought you was already asleep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  decided to shower first,” She informed him as if he couldn't guess from  her slightly damp mass of hair. Currently it was frizzy and wild,  straying all over the place without a care. “Come,” She pet the bed  next to her and leaned against him when he sat on the bed. “We havn't  been alone together in a while, have we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess not. It's weird thinking back on it. You stayed in my room all the time to keep me company then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm...” Lutecia looked over at him. “I still can't believe you stayed with me after everything...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you I would,” He informed her with a light smile. “How could I just leave you, Lutecia?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio...”  She moved slowly, placing her hands onto his shoulders and pushing him  down onto the bed. “Can I... still not get a pet name from you?” She  looked at him with sad eyes. “Can I not be your princess?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lutecia,”  He closed his eyes and thought. “Lulu.” He declared at her finally.  “I'm going to call you Lulu.” He felt her breath close to his face and  suddenly had a strange desire creeping up from his stomach. “Um,” He  opened his eyes to look right into hers as she rested her forehead  against his. “Lulu...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?” She laid her body on top of his. “What is it, Eli-chan?” She came up with a cute name for him on the spot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This... I don't really...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do  you want me to move?” The male looked at her a long while, not being  able to find an answer to the simple question. “Can I... kiss you?”  Again he couldn't seem to answer her, allowing the girl to close her  eyes and lean over the rest of the way and awkwardly put her lips on  his. Not sure about how to go about it, she pulled back enough to  collect herself and try again, this time almost doing it properly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  loud gasp made them both pull apart and look towards the door where  Caro had a hand over her mouth. “Caro-hime!” Elio looked at her a  moment before looking back at Lutecia. “This is...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio you idiot!” With those words she turned and slammed the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I...” He looked away sadly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Go,”  Lutecia told him softly, making him look at her. “I want you to  myself,” She began her explanation, falling back into the habit of  touching his cheek gently. “But Caro-chan is my friend and you are  still unsure... So please, talk to her and tell her I was the one who  did it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lulu?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Go, before I change my mind.” Moving off  of him, she gave the boy a small nudge. Taking the chance he ran away  from her and through the door, calling out to his princess. '<em>Stupid...</em>' She scolded herself as she touched the warm spot on the bed where he just was. '<em>Why can't this just be simple...? He belonged to her first.</em>' She fell onto the bed and buried her face into the pillow sadly. '<em>Am I just an annoyance to them both? But he kissed me back...</em>' With a small sigh she curled up on the bed and faced the wall. '<em>I wanted you to stay with me instead of chasing her...'</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio  opened the sliding door leading out to the balcony and stepped into the  warm night. “Caro-hime?” He asked softly, walking over to her. “I...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  can see stars here,” She spoke up suddenly. “It's kind of weird isn't  it? Earth only having one moon I mean. It makes the nights a lot darker  so there are more streetlights around here. I wonder if that's why  there is a weird feeling in the air on this planet. So much power being  ran everywhere by such weird methods.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The red head stood next to her and leaned onto the rail as well. “Could be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Standing  in silence, the two looked around the sky. “Do you like her?” She  finally spoke up on the topic he had come for. “I understand, she's  very pretty.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't know,” He told her truthfully. “I feel something for her, but it's there for you too. I think of you each the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” She turned to look at him and almost made the boy jump back at the sudden gentle look. “Then will you kiss me too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiss?” He looked nervous. “Caro-hime, that in there just happened <em>and</em>” He growled as his voice broke yet again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don't mind,” She told him while stepping forward and reaching her hands  up behind his neck. “Is this how it goes?” Leaning up on her tiptoes  she flecked his lips lightly in a testing manor. Once done she kissed  him fully, leaving her mouth on his for a full four seconds before  pulling back. “Wow, it really does make your heart beat fast.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio swallowed, feeling the strange sensation in his gut again. “Caro-hime...?” She looked up at him happily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, my dragoon?” She whispered, feeling her heart beat faster than it currently was. “...Another?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I...”  Moving down, he wrapped his arms around her waist and pulled her closer  a moment before stopping and moving away. “I... don't know what I'm  doing.” He confessed to her. “I feel strange, my body is trying to get  me to do things that I- I don't even know how to <em>do</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's  okay, I don't want anything else.” She smiled up at him happily. “I  feel safe now, just knowing you kissed me. Strange isn't it? How such a  simple act can make you feel all funny inside?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-yeah. Strange, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ne?”  She met his eyes again. “Between Lutecia-chan and myself... I can wait  until you're ready. I'm not even sure about what's going on right now  but Lutecia-chan seems to... So... So I'll try my best! I like  Elio-kun, so I'll find out what I'm feeling!So please... Please think  about me too? I want to explore this with you. I want to find out what  is going on... I know we're young but we're already living in an adult  life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” He nodded at her. “I'll find out what's going on,  what it is I'm feeling as well. Someday I'll be sure of myself but  right now I'm just learning. Please wait for me as well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  will.” She blushed up at him. “Wow, I feel so grown up all of a  sudden.” The remark made Elio crack a smile at her. “Well then... I'll  go talk to Lutecia-chan. Give me five minutes to settle things?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure.”  Elio walked with her back into the house and gave Subaru a small wave  when she passed by him. “Hey Subaru-san,” He greeted nervously at the  look he was getting.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello Elio,” She replied in kind while bending over to be on more eye level with him. “I thought you was going to bed?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah well, I just th<em>ought</em>-” With a grown he looked to the floor as Subaru cheered out at his high pitched word. “Subaru <em>please</em> stop teasing me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  way,” She ruffled his hair as she passed by on the way to her room.  Once there she gave him a small little wave before disappearing behind  the door. “Hey Tia-Tia.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl changing for bed groaned. “ 'Tia' is already a nickname, why do you need to make it into a pet name?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru  smiled at her while stripping down. “Because everyone calls you Tia  now, I need something else.” Once in her pajamas she fell onto the  water bed and giggled happily as she swayed with it. “Ah, it's nice and  cool...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou.” Tia turned off the lights and soon joined her. “I  guess we're sharing a bed while we're here, huh?” Her answer came in  the form of Subaru pulling her against her chest and cuddling the girl.  “S-Subaru... I can't sleep like this.” She blushed lightly in the dark,  feeling the girl's breath ruffle her hair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you want me to stay still,” Subaru protested as she took full advantage of the small bed. “Then you will have to hold me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But...” Tia felt her resolve weaken when her back was stroked. “It's embarrassing...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You said that last time,” Subaru countered her in a whisper. “But we made due, didn't we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We-well, after we made love I wasn't about to leave you...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  let's make love.” Subaru reached down to grab Tia's butt and squeezed  just hard enough to make her gasp out before claiming her lips in a  kiss.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmnn!!? Mm?!! Mnn!... Mm...Mmmmnnnn...”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Hayate  laughed happily as she pet Arf's puppy form in her lap. “Really?” She  asked amazed. “Wow, I never would have thought!” Arisa giggled as well  at the conversation about their past love interest since the departure  to Midchilda. “So are you two taken now?” She pondered farther getting  shaking of their heads. “Aw, so you broke up after all?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Two months ago,” Arisa sighed out while waving it off. “He was a real creep anyway; I don't know <em>what</em> I saw in him.” Her watch caught her eye as she did the motion and  looked at in in shock. “Wow, already three in the morning? Time sure  flies, no wonder I was getting so sleepy.” The girl rubbed her eyes and  yawned out loudly. “Ack, just saying it actually made me tired.” To her  relief Suzuka also yawned out. “You guys don't seem that tired?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno  took the question. “It's only about eleven our time,” He glanced at his  watch to confirm this. “We're sectioned off in twenty-four hour days as  well but our hours last seventy minutes.” The man grinned at their  sleepy faces. “What say we call it a night here and pick up tomorrow?”  The group of them nodded and stood up. “Since Fate and Nanoha are  spending the time with their family we have a room.” The group moved up  the stairs in a mass, cutting off the lights once they reached the top.  “Do you two mind sleeping together?” He already knew the answer but  asked it anyway to be polite. After they confirmed that they didn't  mind at all they were ushered to the master bedroom that would also be  the bunny couple's room. A quick goodnight later and the two were free  to continue down the hall. “Well, I guess I'll say my goodnight here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”  Hayate waved one arm out while holding onto a sleeping Arf-puppy with  the other. “I can't take the only bed left, that would be rude. You  sleep here and I'll sleep on the couch downstairs.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nuh-uh,”  Yuuno cut off her escape path. “You have a lot on your mind, I can  tell. You get in bed and sleep well; I've spent countless nights  sleeping on the ground during digs so a couch is still a step up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  you've been sleeping in a bed for the past few months, you're not used  to it anymore,” Hayate retorted, once again trying to move past him.  “Mou, Yuuno, I'm not taking your bed!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Arf stirred in Hayate's  arms and opened her eyes lazily. “Both of you take the bed, I'll sleep  on the couch.” With that she hopped from Hayate's hold and walked a few  steps before changing into a small child and rubbing her eyes. “Some of  us are trying to sleep after all...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But...” Hayate looked at  Yuuno but quickly turned her gaze. A small silence hung over them  before the girl finally nodded. “I...don't mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh!?” Yuuno looked at her in the dark hallway. “But...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's  okay right?” Hayate tried again as she slowly opened the door and  walked into the room with him in tow. “I mean...we're best friends  right? Best friends sleep together don't they?” Her face colored at her  words. “But, I mean sleep together as in sleep, not sex! We wouldn't do  that after all, because, you know, we're just friends...” Her rambling  slowed down when he laughed lightly at her. “Sorry. I said something  weird.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't mind, I like it when you ramble.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?” Hayate turned to look at him over her shoulder. “It's embarrassing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't know I just do.” A small moment passed between them before Hayate spoke again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um,  I'm going to change for bed so could you... turn around?” Nervously she  swapped her clothes after he did as requested, putting on a light  purple silk nightgown that went clear to her ankles. Once done she sat  on the bed and faced the opposite wall to allow him to change as well.  “So...” She smiled at him in the dark room. “It's a fairly large bed,  right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Compared to the ones we have it's rather small,” He  disagreed with her lightly as they both got in and went back to back,  not helping but to touch lightly. “Sorry I can't sleep with a shirt, it  chokes me and I stay up all night pulling at it...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't  mind.” She flushed feeling her heart beat faster. “Is this the first  time you've slept with a girl? Besides Nanoha I mean?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“With Fate a few times but that's about the same...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wow,”  Hayate giggled nervously. “I'm the odd one out huh?” Shifting, she felt  her back press against his but she didn't feel the need to pull away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Silk?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your nightgown.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh!  Yes. Silk. It was a gift from Vita-chan.” Recalling the memory made her  calm down a little. “We still share a bed and she liked the way it felt  instead of my cotton pajamas so she bought it for me to wear.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She cling to you?” His voice was amused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  cling to her,” She suddenly realized. “Um, This may not be a good time  to bring this up but I get clingy when I sleep... I'm sorry if I do  anything weird...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, no, don't worry,” Yuuno shifted to scratch his cheek. “Rather, I'm sorry if I accidentally brush against you...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate took confidence in his nervousness. “So if your hand slides against me, I shouldn't freak out?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I-I wouldn't!” He stopped protesting when her soft laughter came to his ears. “Hey, don't tease me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Forgive  me,” The girl stuck her tongue out despite him not being able to see  her. “Well, we should get some sleep then... Tomorrow is going to be  busy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. Lots to plan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So... sweet dreams, Yuuno.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Back at you.” The two closed their eyes and tried to get comfortable without bothering the other person too much.</span></p>
