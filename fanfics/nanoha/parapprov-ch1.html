<h1>Parental Approval</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nanoha/index.html">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Fate Testarossa Harlaown took a nervous breath, the blonde looking down 
to make sure her clothes were neat and tidy, her reddish eyes narrowing 
as she flicked away a piece of lint from the black dress. Squaring her 
shoulders in the matching top she knocked on the door, waiting patiently 
for a answer.

Momoko Takamachi smiled sweetly as she saw Fate, then shockingly reached 
out to pull Fate into a hug. &quot;Fate!&quot; she said happily, &quot;So nice to see 
you.&quot; She released Fate, her eyes twinkling with amusement as she saw 
the teen blush, &quot;But Nanoha isn&#39;t here.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Fate acknowledged as she met the taller reddish brown haired 
woman, &quot;actually, I wanted to talk to you and your husband. Is Shiro 
home?&quot;

Momoko raised her eyebrows in surprise as she answered, &quot;Yes, he is. Do 
you want to join us in the living room?&quot;

Fate nodded, &quot;If it&#39;s not a imposition.&quot;

Shiro Takamachi smiled warmly in greeting as Fate entered, his brown 
hair falling into his eyes. Shiro and Momoko ran the Midori-ya caf&eacute;, a 
popular eatery in the city, but Fate was well aware both were formidable 
people. Shiro had once been a professional bodyguard, a man who could 
kill with surprising ease while Momoko had supported him through all 
those hard times.

&quot;Welcome, Fate,&quot; Shiro said as he put the newspaper down, shifting a bit 
on the couch so that Momoko could sit beside him.

Feeling a odd degree of deja vu Fate sat on a cushion on the other side 
of the coffee table, much like the night she, Lindy and Nanoha had told 
the Takamachi family about magic. &quot;Thank you for seeing me like this,&quot; 
she said quietly.

&quot;You&#39;re Nanoha&#39;s dear friend,&quot; Shiro said, &quot;we&#39;re glad to help.&quot;

Momoko gave Fate a worried look, &quot;Do you need help?&quot; She bit her lip, 
&quot;Is there some problem with your mother?&quot;

Knowing how close Lindy was to the two of them Fate quickly headed that 
off, &quot;No, no, nothing like that.&quot;

Shiro gave a relieved smile as he asked, &quot;So why did you want to see 
us?&quot;

Fate opened her mouth, then closed it as she tried to get her thoughts 
in order. After struggling with it a moment she formally bowed, letting 
her head nearly touch the floor as she blurted, &quot;I humbly request 
permission to date your daughter!&quot;

After a beat of dead silence Momoko cheerfully said, &quot;Finally!&quot;

&quot;Finally?&quot; Fate looked up in surprise, feeling relieved to see two 
beaming faces.

Both Shiro and Momoko looked more relieved than anything else, sitting 
back with smiles on their faces. &quot;You mean you haven&#39;t been dating 
already?&quot; Shiro asked Fate curiously, his expression amused.

&quot;Well, not really,&quot; Fate admitted sheepishly. &quot;You&#39;re not surprised?&quot;

&quot;Fate,&quot; Momoko gave her a wry smile, &quot;our Nanoha has been in love with 
you since she was eleven.&quot;

&quot;At least,&quot; Shiro agreed, &quot;you&#39;d have known it yourself if you had seen 
her eyes light up when she got a video mail from you.&quot;

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Fate admitted, blushing.

Momoko gave Fate a long look, her eyes twinkling with amusement. &quot;I do 
have to ask what your eventual intentions are for our Nanoha, Fate,&quot; she 
said.

&quot;Intentions?&quot; Fate echoed weakly.

Shiro nodded firmly, &quot;Momoko has a point, Fate. Do you intend to make a 
honest woman of our Nanoha?&quot;

&quot;A lot of that would depend on Nanoha,&quot; Fate said honestly as she met 
their eyes and said, &quot;but speaking personally, I love her with all my 
heart. If Japan would allow it, I&#39;d marry Nanoha tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Well, I wouldn&#39;t insist on tomorrow,&quot; Momoko said gently, &quot;but I&#39;m glad 
your and Nanoha&#39;s thoughts are going in the same direction.&quot;

&quot;She wants to...?&quot; Fate blushed.

&quot;I think she would if she could,&quot; Shiro agreed. He sat back with a 
satisfied sigh, &quot;To answer your original question, yes I give you 
permission to date Nanoha.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Fate gave them both a blinding smile as she hoped Nanoha&#39;s 
meeting with Lindy Harlown was going as well.

&quot;Hello, Nanoha,&quot; Arf smiled, the tall, busty orange haired woman opening 
the door with a fang bearing smile, &quot;what are you doing here?&quot;

Nanoha Takamachi smiled back, glad to have learned that Arf was more 
bark than bite, especially with people who were friends with Fate. &quot;I 
was wondering if Admiral Lindy was home?&quot; she asked, her reddish brown 
hair flowing down her back in a pony tail. She wore one of her good 
dresses, the type she might have normally saved for a formal dinner.

If Arf noticed Nanoha was dressed a bit oddly, she didn&#39;t mention it. 
&quot;Yup, come on in,&quot; Arf smiled, she orange and white tail swinging from 
the back of her bike shorts as she lead Nanoha into the apartment, her 
breasts contained by a small top.

&quot;Hello, Nanoha,&quot; Chrono smiled, the tall young man standing nearby his 
mother, probably visiting between TSAB missions. He was dressed in a 
simple dark business suit, probably the first thing he had available.

&quot;Chrono!&quot; Nanoha gave him a welcoming smile, then looked towards Lindy 
as she said, &quot;Admiral.&quot;

&quot;Lindy, please,&quot; the taller green haired woman chuckled, dressed in her 
usual stylish housewife clothes, her long green hair slightly poofed out 
from her head.

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Nanoha smiled back, remembering all the months she had 
reported to her during the Jewel Seed and Tome of Darkness cases.

Chrono smiled as he sat down at the kitchen table and said, &quot;Don&#39;t tease 
my mother.&quot;

As Arf sat too down Nanoha sighed, knowing she was going to have to deal 
with three people rather than two. Lindy gave her a gentle look, &quot;Fate 
went out a little while ago, you can wait till she gets back if you 
want.&quot;

Arf shook her head as she nodded at Nanoha, &quot;She said she wanted to see 
you.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Chrono looked curious.

Nanoha took a breath then faced Lindy. &quot;There&#39;s something I wanted to 
talk to you about,&quot; she admitted, &quot;because I don&#39;t want to sneak around 
or deceive you.&quot;

As Nanoha fell silent Lindy gently prompted her, &quot;Yes?&quot;

A blush staining her cheeks Nanoha confessed, &quot;I&#39;m dating your 
daughter.&quot;

Arf thumped the table with her palm as she said, &quot;About time!&quot;

Somewhat more thoughtfully Chrono mused, &quot;Do you want Amy and I to 
gently break it to Yuuno?&quot;

&quot;Good idea,&quot; Arf nodded to Chrono.

&quot;Congradulations,&quot; Lindy said sweetly, firmly clasping Nanoha&#39;s hands in 
her own

&quot;You&#39;re not surprised or anything?&quot; Nanoha blinked a few times.

Lindy looked amused, &quot;You two haven&#39;t exactly subtle, Nanoha.&quot;

Chrono looked a bit sheepish as he added, &quot;Well, Amy had to point it out 
to me, but once I knew you were pretty obvious.&quot;

Arf rolled her eyes, &quot;Typical guy.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be mean,&quot; Nanoha scolded Arf, hiding a smile. She turned back to 
Lindy as she mused, &quot;I guess you&#39;re right, we weren&#39;t hiding things very 
well.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t object to your dating Fate,&quot; Lindy said gently, &quot;but I do hope 
you&#39;ll be cautious. Earth is much less accepting of this sort of things 
than other dimensions.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Nanoha sighed. She smiled a bit sadly, &quot;One of the things Fate 
and I have talked about is moving to Midchilda eventually....&quot;

&quot;It would be safer for you two,&quot; Chrono agreed. He smiled suddenly, &quot;Not 
only that, but you two could get married there too.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Nanoha blushed.

Lindy felt a wicked urge rise up that she couldn&#39;t resist, &quot;So, 
Nanoha... when can I expect some grandchildren?&quot;

&quot;Grandchildren?!&quot; Nanoha yelped as she blushed brighter, if that was 
possible.

End

Notes: I wanted to do a &#39;meets the parents&#39; kind of story, so here it 
is. I could see Fate feeling she needed to do something like this, 
though I doubt Nanoha would be too worried. It also occurred to me that 
their relationship might explain why they moved to Midchilda in 
Strikers.
