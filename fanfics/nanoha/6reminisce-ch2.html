<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The monitors  in front of me moves around at the command of my finger, arranging  themselves in the order I was looking for. Already my eyes were  starting to hurt from staring at them for so long but I didn't want to  stop right now, there was still too much information to go through.  Yuuno had given me the files on Jail Scaglietti at my request but once  again I had underestimated the boy's power to find and sort data.  Anyone else I knew could get me a folder together highlighting things I  would like to know in about three days but Yuuno's one day job has  already taken me four days to go through it and I still havn't finished  everything I wanted to. So far I had managed to gain a lot of valuable  knowledge, most of which I was sure would come in handy later on down  the line. The one thing that made me worried, however, was the repeated  mention of 'Project F', the code name for the process of creating  artificial but real human beings. I knew he was interested in it but  from the files I've been reading it looks more along the line of him  trying to reproduce the results of it. As far as I know I'm the only  life creation to stem from it, although there were numerous  semi-successful attempts. Most of those results either went insane  shortly after being awaken or weren't able to think properly. It was  one thing I never really enjoyed looking at, the lifeless people  floating in tubes. My body shivered and I couldn't help but hug myself.  I, too, had been like that before. Why I was alive right now was  probably due to my sister's memories being implanted in me. I thought  they were my own, and I was mentally stable the moment I awoke. Come to  think of it, according to the information Yuuno had collected before,  Wily Scaglietti also used past memories and emotions- although edited-  to make his first creation. If two people were able to do it, I  couldn't help but wonder... Were there more out there we just didn't  know about? If so... would we draw to each other the way Skeith was  drawn to Nanoha?</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What'cha  doing?” Nanoha's voice floated around the monitors after a playful  knocking on Fate's open office door. “It's past lunch time, you said  you were going to eat with me today.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate blinked at her before  quickly glancing over at her clock and realizing the time. “Oh my, I'm  so sorry! Her hands typed quickly, starting to save her work. “Just  give me three seconds and-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can't,” The brown haired girl sat on  the edge of her desk and smiled down at her. “I have my appointment  with Shamal in ten minutes. Although I could re-schedule it again...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!” Fate frowned at her lover. “Do <em>not</em> re-schedule it! You have been putting this off since the <em>day</em> we got here.” Standing up, she marched over to Nanoha and poked her  nose. “You're going. I'll walk you there just to make sure.” The blond  grabbed Nanoha's hand and lead her out of the office, much to the  displeasure of the one in tow. “I'll make you a lovely dinner since I  stood you up today, so look forward to it okay Kitten?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kitten?” Nanoha instantly smiled. “Hehe, you never call me pet names.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Blushing, Fate continued along her way. “Would you rather me call you 'bunny' then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Either  or,” She trotted a few steps to catch up to her friend and walk next to  her properly. “Can I call you something too? Like 'honey muffin' or  'sweetie pie' or maybe 'cupcake'?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm not a food you know.” Fate giggled at her as they boarded the elevator</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?  Because I could just eat you up.” She smiled as the doors to the  elevator closed and leaned forward to prove her point. The doors  re-opened a few moments later and the two walked down the hallway  leading to the medical room. “Shamal, I'm here!” Her call summoned  forth the doctor from her small office and got a happy smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-chan  you came!” clapping her hands in front of her, Shamal gave the two  girls a happy look. “I was going to come hunt for you in a few minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course I came!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  dragged her here,” Fate said at the same time. Her fiancée blushed  darkly and looked away since it was the truth. “You will be thankful  when you don't have headaches anymore.” Fate leaned over and kissed her  cheek.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh my, Fate-chan,” Shamal took a few steps to get close  to the confused girl and gently tilted her head to the side. “How on  earth did you get this bruise?” She inspected her neck closer. “It  looks like you were bit, did you get in a fight with someone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um...”  Fate took a step back and bowed lightly to her. “Please take good care  of Nanoha for me.” With that she turned around quickly and jogged out  of the room, not looking back before running down the hallway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Was  it something I said?” Shamal reached out and grabbed Nanoha's shirt  collar to keep her from sneaking away without even looking. “You're  already here Nanoha-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But Shaaaamaaaallll...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're  nineteen, that doesn't work on me anymore.” She smiled happily down at  her. “Come on, this will be over before you know it and after today you  won't have anymore headaches while you do your desk work.” Shamal sat  the pouting girl in a chair and held back a comment about how cute her  blushing face made her look.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Hello Vita,” Fate greeted the girl happily as she looked around at the panting forwards. “No slack?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  slack.” Vita allowed her barrier jacket to fade away from her. “I have  to run a patrol tonight so I can't train them this evening so I just  made sure to get in enough right now to cover for it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Have  they been at it for four hours straight?” Fate sweated lightly when the  smaller girl nodded. “Good thing tomorrow is Firesday... That aside,  have you seen Yuuno?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Over there on the observation deck, he's  inspecting the battle data and compiling it for us so he can make a  graph of their improvements based on their magical output through the  devices.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate paused a moment. “You've been around Nanoha <em>way</em> too much to be talking like that.” The blond took off before Vita could  fully process being compared to Nanoha and flew over to Yuuno. “Hey  there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello Fate,” The boy made a monitor appear next to him  and flew it over to her without taking his eyes off what he was doing.  “There you go, all the data on Lutecia I could find.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Before I even asked,” She smiled and stored the monitor in Bardiche. “You're the best.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  try,” Yuuno grinned as he finished up his work since the training was  over for the day. “You'll get the details when you go through that  personally but I'll go ahead and tell you... Lutecia and Zest seem to  be working for someone and not just for themselves... From their  pattern and goals, I have strong evidence to connect them to  Scaglietti.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see...” Fate glared out in the distance. “We finally have another shot at him...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate...” Yuuno stood and put a hand on her shoulder. “I'll help too. We'll get his time time, for certain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you.” She looked over at him and softened a little. “Sorry I get so  tense when we talk about him, I normally take it out on you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno  chuckled to himself and closed his eyes. “It comes with the territory  of being the messenger... I need to get to Hayate and give her the  folder on Lutecia as well, want to come?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can we get some food along the way?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Haha, sure. I skipped lunch.” Yuuno put a hand on her back to guide her off towards the mess hall.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Ne,  Tia?” Subaru sank down into the hot water of the bath and looked at the  ever changing scenery on the screen wall. “Don't you think that our  training has doubled in intensity the past few days?” The blue haired  girl changed her gaze over to the broad next to her. “I mean... ever  since we had that meeting about our new targets?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia sank down in  the water in thought, idly running the question over in her head a few  times. She had also noticed the sudden harder training and even the  slight change in her teacher's eyes. Nanoha's normally caring and  gentle eyes now had a sadness and anger deep in them sometimes when she  fought. Normally after the occasion she would be hit by some spell and  her next moves would be quicker and more precise, as if she had been  jarred back from day dreaming. “Yes,” She finally answered her friend.  “I think they are trying to prepare us as best they can for something  yet to come.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like what?” Subaru slid over next to the girl who  had both her arms over the side of the large bath tub. “Something about  that Scaglietti? Or Lutecia?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever Scaglietti is about, they  are being secretive with it. We are going to be briefed soon about  Lutecia but everything we hear about the other person is from  conversations that stop when we get too close to them.” Tia sighed and  closed her eyes. “I just wish they would tell us everything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They  have their reasons.” Subaru slid closer yet again, this time sitting  right next to her girlfriend and pulling Tia's arm down from the  bathtub so it would be over her shoulders instead. “For now let's just  wait until they can tell us about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um, y-yeah...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Is this too much?” Subaru blushed lightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um...no...  No, it's okay.” She gave Subaru's shoulder a small squeeze to encourage  her to rest against her body more. “Its fine...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl shyly reached one hand back up to touch the one on her shoulder. “Being held by Tia is the best.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“R-really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmmhmm...” She sighed out contently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, you're in here too?” Caro's voice floated over to them, making each girl jump lightly. “Mind if I join you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not at all,” Tia blushed darkly, allowing the girl to sit next to her</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro  blinked, suddenly looking up and voicing her thoughts aloud. “For some  reason I have the strangest feeling that I have really bad timing...”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“I'm  home!” Nanoha greeted as she entered her home and slipped off her  flight lieutenant boots.”Mm, something smells great!” She ran into the  kitchen happily while sniffing. “Is it lasagna?” After peeking over  Fate's shoulder she cheered out happily. “It <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">is</span></em>!” Nanoha hugged her tightly from behind. “Fate you're the best!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hehe,  thank you.” The red eyed girl nuzzled back against her a moment before  looking at her fully. “Hey you're not wearing them!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Instantly Nanoha blushed. “I don't have to when I'm not working...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I want to see them!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come on, put them on!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  looked down a moment before slowly reaching into her pocket and pulling  out a small hard case. With a flick she opened it and took out a small  pair of glasses, slowly opening it up and putting them on. The frame  was thin, a light silver color with barely visible flecks of blue  across them. The lens themselves were also small, covering her eyes and  not much else. “...I feel stupid...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Awww,” Fate smiled  brightly, voice actually going above it's normal soft spoken tone.  “You're adorable!” Before Nanoha could react, she brought up her hands  and formed a camera screen, snapping a picture. Her lover appeared  shocked a moment before looking away shyly. “I love them, Kitten.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  pet name seemed to lift her spirits enough to make eye contact again.  “Well, since you're not the type of person to use pet names I'll reward  you by letting you keep that picture.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're too kind.” Fate  stirred her mirepoix sauce before continuing. “Have you tried reading  anything yet?” Her body shifted over to the side to check her noodles  and prepare to start building the dish for the oven</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, I don't  have to hold things out at arm's length anymore.” Nanoha pushed up her  glasses on her nose, a motion she just knew would turn into a habit  soon. “Shamal said I had long vision capable of making sniper rifle  scopes look like children's toys, but because of it I couldn't focus on  anything close up... That's why I was having headaches when I used my  monitors so much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you.” Fate put a hand on her hip. “Mou, you should have listened to me a month ago.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh like you always listen to what I say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do so!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not, not!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do too!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not, not, not!” The two girls glared at each other a moment before dissolving into giggles.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Elio  looked up lightly, watching the bottles spin as he juggled them. A few  drops of liquid splashed his face but for the most part he was able to  keep them going fast enough where they didn't spill out their contents.  After a half minute of this he stopped flicking them into the air and  caught them, prompting the blue haired man next to him to applaud.  &quot;Very nice,&quot; he congratulated the boy. &quot;What say you stop being  military and help me out? I could use another barkeep?&quot; Kuhn laughed at  his own joke and ruffled the kid's hair. &quot;All right then, you can keep  those bottles. Keep at least enough liquid in them to make three drinks  at all times or it's just circus juggling.&quot; Reaching out, he plucked a  mostly empty bottle from his shelf and added it in the bag containing  the other bottles. &quot;And keep this as well,&quot;
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;What is it?&quot; Elio took the offered sack and peeked inside.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;A  little bit of rum, add it to your drink if you're having a bad day. Now  scoot on back to base before you're caught with that.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Military can drink regardless of age.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Yeah  but it makes me look bad, now go!&quot; He pointed at the door and grinned.  &quot;I have a date in five minutes and I have to prepare for it! Oh, and  don't juggle them if you crack a bottle okay? Just stop right then and  throw it away.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All right,” Elio rolled up the end of the bag he  was carrying and walked out of the almost empty night club and into the  morning sun. After taking a breath his stomach growled at him angrily,  demanding to be fed. The boy looked at his watch and realized that he  could probably make it to his favorite taco stand just in time for  their opening if he started walking now. With a goal in mind he started  to plan out his day as he walked. '<em>I can get back to the base around  two o'clock so that will give me a chance to see if anyone is free to  train with, or maybe I can use the standard training field since I'm  already on the other side of the base... A change in work outs could be  good.</em>' With a nod to himself he continued along his way a moment  before slowing down to a stop and looking around. Strada was vibrating  against his wrist lightly, a silent warning that a confirmed threat was  nearby. The boy glanced around a little more before realizing that the  street he was on would be a bad place for a battle. Dodging past the  people he turned the corner and came face to face with a girl his  height. After the initial shock he regained himself enough to look at  her purple hair and eyes. Her two part dress was a dark black, flared  at the hems with purple. The top covered her chest and looped around to  her back complete with purple lace around the edges and a bow with a  heart on it up front. The bottom part started at her waist, just below  her exposed stomach and flared out to her knees into a full puffy dress  with purple lace and mini bows scattered along it. The arms were not  covered but instead had a band that went around her small biceps.  Gloves graced her hands reminding the boy instantly of the ones Caro  wore.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio,” She greeted him softly, clasping her hands in front  of herself and bowing towards him. The red head leaped backwards  instantly, body flaring out with a small fire as his barrier jacket  formed around him. His spear came at his call as well, sending the  people around them scrambling to get away from the now armed male. “I  did not come here to fight,” Lutecia continued as he circled her, posed  to strike.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You are wanted by the government, please come along quietly and without resistance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do  you... not wish to know about your past, Elio?” Lutecia met his eyes,  gazing at him softly. “Why you were adopted when you were four, and why  your parents died when you were eight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You... How do you know that!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  can find out everything for you.” Lutecia walked over to him and stood  in front of the boy again. “Will you come with me so we can talk,  please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio quickly ran the situation over in his mind before  answering. If he were to lower his guard it would allow her to attack  him before he could react. On the other hand if she was telling the  truth and only wanted to exchange information with him he would be able  to find out why he couldn't remember anything that happened before he  was adopted. “How can I trust you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia simply started to  remove her gloves from her hands and tucked them into a small purse on  her side. “Please talk with me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A few moments passed before Elio  lowered his stance but still kept his spear out. “How do you know my  past?” He repeated his question once more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because I found it  out for you, knight.” The girl turned and began to walk, making Elio  run a few steps to keep up with her. “I thought you might like to know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you really not trust me so?” She looked at his spear. “I won't hurt you, I promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  tone made Elio wince physically. She was so quiet, so soft spoken, that  he felt as if he had wronged her just by being rude. “I'm sorry,”  Strada went back into his watch form but he kept his barrier jacket on  since she also had hers. “Is that better?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you.” She bowed lightly towards him. “Would you like to come back to my house? We can talk all you like there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm  sorry.” Elio stopped walking. “Are you just toying with me, Lutecia?  Why are you after relics? Why do you claim to know about my past when  even Fate-san can't find anything? Why are you being so polite with me?  Why are you here alone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because,” She answered easily, turning  and walking back over to him before looking up into his eyes. “I want  you... to be my knight.” Her hand reached up and touched his cheek.  “Come with me...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio!” Fate's voice called out to him, making the boy turn to look where the sound was coming from.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Until next time, Elio.” Lutecia's voice floated up into his ear before she quickly kissed his cheek.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Turning  around, he gasped out. The boy spun a few times but could no longer  find the girl who had just kissed him. “What... what was that all  about...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What's going on!?” Fate finally made it to him and  panted, bending over to catch her breath. “Shari suddenly told me your  barrier jacket was activated!” Caro came up to them next, her short  legs making her a little slower.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't know.” He looked over  at Caro uneasily when she glared at the glistening spot on his cheek  where Lutecia's lip balm rubbed off on him. Before he could say  anything the girl stormed over to him and reached up, holding his cheek  with one hand and vigorously rubbing the spot with the sleeve of her  shirt. “H-hey! Ow, that hurts...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then don't let her do it!” She countered, taking after Nanoha and puffing out her cheeks at him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um,”  Fate scratched her cheek with one finger. “Elio, would you mind if we  stayed with you until you're finished in the town...I'd like to hear  what just happened too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,” He looked up into the sky, wondering what exactly was going on with him. “I'd prefer that actually...”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha  smiled to herself as Tia shot down all of the bullets she had fired at  her. Through the short months they had been here, the forwards all had  improved so dramatically that she had to constantly adjust her training  routine as to not allow herself to be beaten in mock battles. Ever  since Subaru had told her about Vita going all out and possibly saving  her life thanks to the harsh training, Nanoha had been lowering her  limiter down to a B rank so she too would be able to really fight  against them without fear of hurting them too much. This allowed her to  properly fight them, using her twist and turns that they may see on the  actual battlefield instead of simply blocking their attacks with a  superior shield. Her blast had gone from simple training bullets to  slightly watered down real bullets, fired at the speed of the standard  B-class mage. Of all her students, Tia was the one who had improved the  most. It wasn't simple power, as Subaru out classed her there, but the  way her mind worked lead her to believe that the orange haired girl  would one day be in charge of her own unit.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia,” Nanoha waved at  the girl to show the end of the sparring match. Neither had won, but in  all she considered it over when her expectations were met. “Your energy  output has been stable lately, breaking the line of personal levitation  even while battling... Would you want to learn how to fly?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fly!? Me!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  teacher giggled to herself. “Well, I really shouldn't say that since  you won't be able to truly soar until you're at least a double A, but  yes, the training can begin now. I believe you will be able to hover a  little. Although not much, it will make all the difference in the world  when combined with Subaru's wing road. I've noticed that you two have  your own combos with it so this will help out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Flying...” Tia couldn't seem to comprehend it just yet. “I'll be able to...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  scratched her head, obviously seeing Tia tune her out after the world  'fly' left her mouth. With a quick raising of her hands she formed a  keyboard and monitor. Moments later and her call went through,  revealing Yuuno. “Hey there, are you busy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The bookworm closed down the monitor full of text and smiled at her. “Never too busy for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Flirt,” She accused with a smile. “I'm going to teach Tia a little bit about flying, can you come to my training field?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oi...” Yuuno suddenly got nervous. “you're not going to-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure am,” She gave him a peace sign. “Give a girl a little fun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're sadistic.” The screen cut off shortly after he stood up to come to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,  Tia, come here a moment please?” Nanoha motioned her over and turned  the girl around so they were facing the same direction. “Spread your  arms out really wide and close your eyes.” She wrapped her arms around  the girl's waist tightly. “Stand on my feet, it's okay my boots won't  let you hurt me. Good, now imagine yourself lifting into the air.  Lifting... lifting... Breath in steadily, taste the fresh air...”  Nanoha smiled when she saw Yuuno come up to them and land. “Now take a  deep breath. Really deep. Imagine yourself floating upwards as you  breathe...good...good... now take a huge breath, as if you were about  to scream at the top of your lungs. Now open your eyes.” Nanoha grinned  when the girl instantly went stiff in her arms. She had flown them up  so high into the air that it would take a little over half a minute for  her to fall all the way down. “Now fly!” She dropped the girl happily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia  screamed out frantically, flailing her arms out as she fell. When her  breath ran out she took in another gasp before repeating, tumbling head  over heels. Finally after what seemed like an eternity she found  herself being embraced and slowing down drastically. The wind stopped  beating around her and she used the time to cling onto whoever had  saved her and begin to hyperventilate. Seconds passed before she would  open her eyes and realize that they were back on the ground and it was  Yuuno that was carrying her. “Y-Yuuno-san...” Slowly she collected  herself and nodded at him to show that she could stand. Nanoha landed a  little bit away from her and walked over to the shaking girl  cheerfully. “You... you<em>...  dropped </em>me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now that you  know what it's like to tumble through the air we won't have that worry  lingering in the back of your mind.” She smiled innocently, making Tia  suddenly remember that the girl in front of her was nick named 'white  devil' for a reason.</span></p>

Subaru  stretched out wearily as she and Vita made their way to the mess hall  after a round of training together. Even though Nanoha was her role  model she had taken a liking to the little red headed girl as well,  mainly because she treated her a lot rougher than everyone else. At  first she had mistaken it for contempt but after a while she had come  to realize that Vita was training her so hard because just as she  protected Nanoha and the others, Subaru also protected Tia and the  rest. Now the blue haired girl truly felt stronger than she had ever  before, to the point where she even forced Vita's device to auto shield  when her primary one was broken through. The thought made her giggle,  bringing a hand to her mouth to try and cover it. If Vita noticed this,  she didn't show it. Instead the girl trotted over to their usual table  and greeted Hayate, receiving a pat on her head.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru,” Tia called her attention over and motioned for her to sit. “How was your training?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Great,” She instantly started picking things off her girlfriend's plate. “Yours?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Scary.” The girl shivered slightly, still not quite over what happened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello,” Nanoha sat down next to them and placed her plate on the table.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-san!” Subaru looked at her happily. “You rarely eat at the mess hall with us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nyahaha,”  She speared a small cherry tomato on her plate and smiled, offering it  to Tia. “Have you tried one of these, there are some just like it on my  home planet!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia scooted away from Nanoha, eying the bite as if  it would explode the second she placed it in her mouth. “I'm never  trusting you ever again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds like someone had flying  lessons,” Fate greeted them as she sat down also. “Nanoha, you  didn't...?” The smile she got made her sigh out. “I <em>know</em> it works, but still...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Vita-chan, what's the best way to teach someone how to fly?” Nanoha asked the short girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Drop them from a high altitude.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you!” Nanoha watched Elio sit down across from her and Caro plop down  on the other side of the table, far away from him. She blinked a moment  and leaned over towards Fate. “Ne, why aren't our kids sitting by each  other?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They're arguing,” Fate whispered back to her softly. “I'm not entirely sure why but I think it has to do with Lutecia.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ahhh...”  Nanoha bit into her food and thought about it while looking over at her  little girl who was feeding her dragon table scraps. The rest of the  group started talking to each other, soon drowning out the other's  voices as they laughed and shared their days. Caro ended up feeding  most of her dinner to Freidliche before letting out a small sigh and  leaving the table without telling anyone. Seeing her 'daughter' leave  so suddenly without even eating made Nanoha feel a little uneasy so she  got up and followed her. “Hey there,” she greeted when they reached the  elevator. “Want to come up to my loft? I have cookies.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...  'kay.” Caro reached up and took the offered hand and held it while  waiting for the short ride up to be over. Once they reached her  guardian's home she sat on the couch while waiting on the offered  treats to arrive. Freidliche curled up at the end of the furniture and  laid down for a small nap after his meal. A plate of cookies were  placed on the coffee table in front of her and she found one being  offered so she took it and bit down, chewing thoughtfully. “Thank you,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No matter what, cookies always make things better.” Nanoha put an arm around the girl. “What's troubling you sweetheart?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“... Mommy, what's 'jealousy' mean?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where did you hear that from?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru-san  and Tia-san were talking the other day after we had the encounter with  Lutecia-chan... I told them what happened and they said I was jealous  and made a comment about how cute it was.” She looked up at Nanoha  sadly. “I don't feel cute at all right now...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,” She  pondered on how to answer her. “being jealous isn't cute, but I suppose  from an outside point of view it can look that way to them...” She  decided to leave out the fact that she also found it insanely cute for  her to be jealous at such an early age. “Jealousy is... How should I  put this... A feeling you get when somebody has something you want  really really badly, or if something you do have suddenly belongs to  someone else... I guess...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I havn't lost anything...Nor do I want something someone else has...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um...”  The older girl thought harder, glancing over at the door when Fate came  in. “Well, here's an example. Back when I was younger, I spent a lot of  time with Yuuno-kun. Everyone always said how cute of a couple we were,  but Fate wanted me to be a couple with <em>her</em>, so you could say that Fate was jealous of Yuuno-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“H-hey...” Fate blushed, wondering what she had just walked in on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  think for a moment...” Nanoha continued. “If you were really close to a  friend and someone else suddenly moved in and took that person away  from you, 'jealous' is how you would feel. You would want that special  someone back, or want the other person to stop trying and take that  friend from you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro chewed on the words along with her cookie.  “So...What I'm feeling is jealousy for Lutecia for trying to take my  knight from me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I believe so?” Nanoha looked over at Fate, who  nodded after hearing it all. “Yes, that may be it. Jealousy is a nasty  feeling, don't dwell on it. It is one of those things that will make  you do things you normally wouldn't ever do. We don't want our cute  little Caro-chan to turn into a mean person do we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” She answered immediately.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then try not to worry about it, or to push Elio away because of how you feel. No need to be angry at <em>him</em> after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He shouldn't have let her kiss him!” She suddenly protested.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  came to Nanoha's rescue when she seemed to be at a loss for words.  “Well, the first time he was in a struggle bind, and the second time I  distracted him,” She smiled lightly at the look she received.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro bit into the cookie harshly and mumbled. “He still shouldn't have let it happen... he's <em>my</em> knight...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aaaaaand,  that's what jealousy does to you.” Nanoha pet Caro's head. “We just  said we didn't want Caro-chan to be mean right?” The words hit the  little girl hard, making her look down sadly. “Don't be like that. Why  don't you just go talk with him and see for yourself that Elio is yours  and not Lutecia's?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe bring him something to show that  you're sorry for treating him bad too,” Fate added in. “He has a huge  sweet tooth, you can use our kitchen to make something for him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The small girl looked up at Fate “Really? You won't mind?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anytime,”  She confirmed. She watched the two on the couch finish up their  conversation and waved to Caro when she left, a new cookie in hand.  Freidliche gave them a thankful look for taking care of it's master  before following her into the hallway. “Well,” She spoke up. “She takes  after you all right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She looks adorable when  she's angry.” Fate laughed at Nanoha's embarrassed look. “The way you  puff out your cheeks and wrinkle your nose is priceless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do  not do that!” The blue eyed girl protested, standing up and proceeding  to do what she just denied. “Stop picking on me, miss jealous over a  ferret. Mou, you're just like a man sometimes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me?” Fate  followed her up the stairs after grabbing a cookie for herself. “Why am  I like a guy, if anything it's you, miss raging hormones.” She started  nibbling her treat while arguing playfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha turned around, flushing. “I do <em>not</em> have raging hormones, I'm your average girl in her early twenties!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're a sex crazed teenager!” Fate pushed her onto the bed. “Admit it! You're the male of the relationship.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou, fine!” Nanoha rolled her over. “Then let me show you how manly I can be!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  blushed darkly and closed her eyes, offering herself to her lover. A  few moments passed and she suddenly opened her eyes back up. “Hey, give  me back my cookie!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You snooze you lose, and you lose!” Nanoha  ate the last of it and licked her fingers. “Serves you right you big  boobed demon! Calling me a man, honestly.” She crossed her arms and  hmphed at her. After a moment she opened one eye to look and gasped out  when Fate wasn't paying attention anymore. “Hey, don't ignore me when  I'm pouting!” The flight instructor flailed out her arms.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Tia  looked out the window of her dorm room and leaned against the frame.  The night air was already getting rather chilly, a sign that fall was  fast approaching. To test how cold it was she leaned outside of the  window and took a breath before exhaling to see if it was visible or  not. No white fog came to her call so she decided that she would have  to wait a while longer before the really cold season would come. This  suited her just fine, as the warm weather always made her feel more at  ease. Subaru on the other hand liked it cold, a fact that made them  argue constantly over the temperature to leave their room at. Even  though she preferred it to be at least seventy two lately she found  herself cutting it down to sixty-nine, either for her own comfort after  a hard day's work out or for Subaru's pleasure she wasn't sure. '<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru,</span></em>' Her mind wondered idly while star gazing. '<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">How long has it been now? Almost three months? Where does the time go?</span></em>' She reflected back on the awkward moments and shy stammering of words back then. '<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I havn't been the best girlfriend in the world... I wonder how she even puts up with me.</span></em>' with a small sigh she closed her eyes. '<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  despite everything, she's always there for me. Always looking at me  with that adoring expression. Always there to offer a simple hug when  I'm a little down...</span></em>'
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You'll catch a cold,” Subaru's voice made  Tia jump a little before she wrapped a blanket around her and held the  girl from behind. “What are you thinking about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She blushed  softly, feeling the warmth of Subaru's body against her back and the  added comfort of the blanket she had around them as well. “Different  things,” She answered evasively. “What are <em>you</em> thinking about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How your hair looks pretty in the moonlight.” Subaru giggled lightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was happening again, the casual act of laughing made Tia drop down all  her barricades. She didn't have to prove herself to Subaru, never has.  Her room mate knew this but it never stopped her from trying to do it  anyway, secretly wanting her praise. On the outside she was always  stern and ready, but Subaru knew more than that. She knew the girl  inside that hid underneath it all, and she also knew how to make her  truly smile. “Hey,” She spoke up, lightly turning around in the embrace  to look at Subaru. Her arms went up around her neck and felt Subaru's  tighten around her waist. “Will you... kiss me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru leaned  forward instantly, giving Tia's forehead a small peck before rubbing  their noses together and finally meeting her lips with her own. The  action itself was simple, but it was still the first one they had  shared since becoming a couple. She held it as long as she could before  pulling away lightly, feeling their lips stick to each other's for just  a small moment. Tia leaned forward slowly, reclaiming them once again  and making Subaru gasp out lightly in the kiss. The second one didn't  last near as long and the third one even shorter than that, but each  one would remain in her memory for a long time to come she was sure.  Her mouth opened to say something but the orange haired girl simply  pressed against her chest, resting her head on Subaru's shoulder.  Instead of speaking, she simply held onto her and rubbed her back  gently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let's...” Tia whispered after a long moment. “Be more open about our relationship for now on... okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,”  Subaru closed her eyes and pulled her closer. Her eyes watered happily  as she nuzzled her girlfriend's hair like a kitten would.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I like you, Subaru... a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  too,” She replied softly, giving her a kiss to the temple. “I like you  a lot too.” Subaru smiled, feeling as if nothing could make her any  happier than she was right now. '<em>One day I will tell you I love you  again... until you're ready I'll still be here, waiting. Take your  time, Tia, I won't go anywhere I promise.</em>'</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha  snapped her eyes open quickly, rolling out of bed and stumbled down the  stairs before her mind even realized what was happening. Fate was right  next to her, giving the command for their windows to open up and  allowing them to fly through it. Red windows flashed all around them  displaying 'alert' over and over again. Once outside in the crisp night  air she managed to collect herself and realize that her body reacted to  the scramble out of instinct. Now that she knew what was going on the  two flew towards the main office building while calling their barrier  jackets in the process. The window was open for them already and Hayate  flew up next to them along with Rein. Upon entering they were  immediately briefed on the situation while waiting for the others to  arrive. They didn't disappoint and showed up not a minute later,  scrambling into the room via Subaru's wing road.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How many?” Hayate  asked as she sat in her commanding chair. The two night watchers typed  quickly, bringing up a visual of several drones flying around the  ocean. “Looks like...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fifty-seven,” Nanoha stated after a few  moments. “No wait, sixty three, more just came.” She couldn't help but  be proud of herself when everyone gave her a shocked look. '<em>Bah, who needs glasses?</em>'</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That's too many...” Hayate frowned. “It's a diversion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We can split up,” Fate offered. “ Nanoha and I can take out the drones, Lightning and Stars can search the area.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.” Hayate nodded. “Move out!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma'am!” The two leaders leapt back out the window, followed by their students after a few confused seconds.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wha-what's going on!?” Subaru asked out, skating after them as quickly as she could on her road.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Get  to the helicopter and meet up with us!” Fate shouted back before taking  off with her partner and leaving them in her wake. “<em>Nanoha, have you not done any scramble drills with them?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Only one,</em>” She admitted sadly. “<em>I'm such a screw up...</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Don't worry, we'll work on it later. Right now lets focus on destroying all of these. We're on our own so be careful.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>If only Vita and the others didn't have to go patrol a neighboring town...</em>”  Nanoha set herself, spinning in the air to balance herself out and wake  her up more. Her body stretched out as she flew, trying to prepare  herself for the upcoming work out. “<em>Sighted. They all seem to be doing nothing but flying around... New models on visual. Options?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I'll  take the new models and gather the data. You stay mid range and take  them out as you see fit. If this is really 'him' then we need to finish  this quickly.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan, Nanoha-chan,” Hayate's face appeared on a screen flying by both of them. “Permission granted for Triple-A.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you,” Nanoha gave her an encouraging smile, knowing the limiter release  was primarily due to her being worried they wouldn't react fast enough  thanks to the rude awakening. “Raising Heart, remove limiter. Stance:  AAA.” She received a confirmation and felt a ripple of energy behind  her as well, proof that Fate also powered up. Upon reaching the  battlefield she slowed down and formed her staff in shooting mode. Her  left hand caught it in the air and she eyed her targets to pick out the  best method of engaging. Her hand twitched nervously when she realized  how difficult of a battle this would be. Surprisingly she felt suddenly  calmer when her right hand decided to flex it's fingers in an effort to  prepare.<em> 'We can do this... In an hour I'll be back in my bed snoozing</em>...'  She gripped her fist and grabbed her staff with both hands. As soon as  the first explosion came from Fate's side she let loose a massive blast  of energy at the same time as a barrier formed around them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Will  they be okay?” Subaru asked, watching the battle in the distance from a  window of the helicopter. “Sixty-three...” She swallowed thickly. '<em>All  four of us have to get together before we can even take twenty...When  we're solo five or six is our limit before we start getting hurt.</em>'</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't  worry,” Rein told her as she flew close to the girl. “They were given  access to triple-A, so they will be able to take them out easily. As  for you four,” The small girl spun in the air, changing into her  barrier jacket. “Lightning, you will be deployed on the east side of  the bridge. Stars, you will be on the west. Your goal is to cover the  grounds as fast as you can so split up and search. You are looking for  anything at all that looks suspicious. Subaru, use your wing road to  get a better aerial view. Caro, can you ride Freidliche?” She received  a small nod so she continued. “Then you and Elio fly around together,  if you see something, drop Elio off and continue searching on your  own.” The forwards all saluted as the hatch of the aircraft opened.  Freidliche ran out first, giving a small jump before shifting into his  larger form and roaring out. Caro nodded to herself and looked over at  Elio before taking his hand and leaping onto her dragon's back with  him. The two flew away from the helicopter quickly and started scanning  their area while Subaru and Tia leapt as well, sliding down the wing  road.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Freidliche, could you loop around over by that dark  section over there?” Caro pointed to the side and felt her dragon do as  requested. After a small pause she smiled and pet the scales of her  summon. “I'll pass on the reins, thank you. You're my friend, not my  slave.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Telepathy?” Elio held on to her during the bank and looked to the side to inspect the area.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,  Kind of. I can understand him, so when he growls or something he's  normally just talking to me.” Caro trailed off her sentence after  seeing a small flash of light. “Over there, I saw something like a  magical circle.” Flying fast, the trio descended to the area and  inspected. “There, at the park!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio summoned his spear and  stood up on top of Freidliche to wait for the right moment. When the  chance came he leapt off and soared towards the ground with his spear  raised above his head. The person below him reached up and grabbed the  attack with both hands, twisting around and slinging the boy along the  ground. With a grunt he skidded across the grass and slammed into a  tree. “<em>Caro-hime... I'm going to need some help...</em>” The red head grunted and pushed himself up, ignoring the burning sensation on his back. “<em>It's the other guy, Zest.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio,”  Zest greeted him, pulling back the hood of his cloak and observing him.  “Just who I was looking for.” His eyes went over to Caro when she  dropped down from the sky. “And Caro as well I see.” The next moment a  two story tall dragon landed with a loud crash and roared directly into  the man's face. “...Maybe this won't be so easy after all...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  flipped through the air, cleaving one of the drones in half before  blasting several more with short burst of magical bullets. “Arc Saber!”  Bardiche slashed through the air and cut through three more of her  opponents.<em> “Nanoha, a few are trying to leave the barrier.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I see them.</em>”  The girl charged her staff up quickly. “Control Buster!” A large beam  shot through the mass of drones, zig-zagging through several of them  before reaching the other side of the shield. Nanoha closed her eyes  tightly and felt her magic in her fingertips. “Get them...” Fingers  moved quickly, guiding her attack towards the devices and giving chase  for fifteen seconds before melting through their AMF field and blowing  them up. “<em>I got the-ahhh</em>!” Nanoha screamed out when her eyes  re-opened to the sight of several new type drones circling her. “Flash  move!” Her escape was cut off just as fast, forcing her back towards  the middle of them. The drones charged her all at once, nimbly dancing  around her bullets while she flew around quickly. No matter how much  she flipped and looped she still found herself constantly swarmed by  the machines, each deflecting her blast or simply avoiding them all  together. '<em>They're not normal drones...Someone is flying them...</em>' Her eyes looked for an escape route quickly. “<em>Fate, I need some help!</em>”  Her eyes found her partner, who was stopped yet again on her way over  to battle a group that seemed to be moving just as fast. Raising  Heart's auto barrier saved her hide as the machines started to counter  attack, swirling circles around her and shooting balls of energy and  lasers constantly. Her staff swung out at them, firing yet again and  missing. '<em>What do I do!?</em>'</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Have you forgotten me?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha's  eyes widened, hearing the tone of a tuning fork echo throughout her  body. Her right hand flexed out, popping the knuckles of each joint. '<em>If projectiles don't work...</em>' The girl heard her heart beat in her ears. '<em>Loan me a little of your power!</em>'  Nanoha held up Raising Heart. The gold tips blurred out before forming  a curved surface to shield the gem and lashed out pink energy from it  to create a scythe. “Phase Shift: Fate!” Magenta energy flared around  her, covering her body and re-writing the data of her jacket. Her hair  ribbons dissolved and allowed her hair to fly out behind her before  being kept together by a single white ribbon near the tip. Her body was  covered by a white form-fitting fabric that covered her much like a one  piece bathing suit would. Two small blue belts wrapped around the top  and bottom of her breast before tightening slightly and solidifying. A  larger belt went around her waist, hanging loosely around her with a  white-ish blue skirt coming from it. Thigh high stockings graced her  legs, also accented by the small blue belt straps near both the top and  bottom. White ankle high boots formed over her feet, flaring out a  little at the top for maneuverability. Gloves embraced her hands, also  as clean as snow. A blue triangle appeared on the top of them before  finally a matching cape flared out behind her, attached at her  shoulders. Nanoha took in a deep breath, grabbing her weapon and  preparing herself to strike. “Arc Saber!” Her plasma blade flared our  thickly as she slashed, cleaving several of the drones in half and  allowing her a path of escape.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha Phase shifted: Fate mode. ” She called over to her as the two went back-to-back. “I feel stronger...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Limiter breeched,” Raising Heart informed her. “S- status achieved.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oops,” She laughed nervously while looking at the remaining army. “Hayate-chan will scold me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Never mind that, is that my old barrier jacket!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,”  She admitted shyly. “I thought it would be fitting since I'm using your  combat data.” She gripped her scythe and mimicked Fate's pose. “One  thing, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What's that?” Fate narrowed her eyes and prepared to strike.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Does it always feel this drafty in various places?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate smirked. “You get used to it.” With that she launched herself forward to engage once again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">On  the ground not too far from the battle raging in the skies Tia reloaded  her guns before rolling out from behind a car and shooting down a few  drones in the air. “This is getting stupid!” She cried out, ducking  back under her cover and shooting homing bullets into the air. “Subaru,  they're only here to keep us from going someplace!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I <em>know</em>!”  She cried out, skating around the parking lot to avoid lasers. Two  drones blew up with a little help of her fist but four more flew over  to them and started attacking. “They're not trying to kill us, they're  just keeping us busy! But why!?” She ducked under an attack and cut a  flip with her wing road. “...The Lightning members!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rein-san!”  Tia quickly opened up a com patch to her. “Check in on the Lightning  squad!” She watched the silver haired girl quickly type things out  before getting a few monitors around her. “That's... that's Zest!” Tia  called over her shoulder to her friend. “Subaru! We have to get to  them!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Zest shifted his shoulder lightly as he shrugged off  another attack from Elio's spear. The attacks were getting a little  slower as the enchanting magic faded, allowing him to land a clean kick  on the boy's stomach to send him reeling backwards. The dragon lashed  it's tail out at him, forcing him into the air only to be knocked out  from a well placed cleave from it's claw. The man hit the ground hard  and coughed out roughly. “It seems that dragon of yours is more  powerful than I thought...” Zest stood up and angrily ran his hand  along the blood leaking from his arm. “I have no choice... Blood  binds!” The red liquid spread around him, drawing from his own body,  before collecting in a ball in front of him. “With the price of my life  essence, I bind thee!” The ball shattered, slinging red chain links  around Freidliche quickly, tightening and slamming the beast to the  ground and trapping him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Blood magic!?” Caro gasped out when her  dragon roared in pain. “Freidliche!” She watched the dragon scream out  as the chains tightened “He'll be crushed!” He hands started to glow  brightly. “I'm sorry, Freid, I can't watch you be hurt...Rest for now.”  Her gaze looked over to Elio, who was slowly pushing himself back up  from the ground. “I'm sorry, my dragoon, I can't give you your  armor...” She closed her eyes tightly when her dragon roared out again.  “Release!” Thick mist shattered around them as the dragon dissolved  back to his home land. As soon as the spell finished she looked up to  see the body of Zest in front of her just before she felt a strong fist  on her stomach. “Ah...ahhhhh...” Caro slowly fell to her knees, eyes  wide as she held her stomach and fell over.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Princess!!” Elio  growled out, gripping his spear and dashing towards him. “You bastard!”  Rearing back, he thrust his spear forward and impaled the man's  shoulder all the way through. Instead of crying out in pain, Zest  simply held up his hand and summoned the blood into another ball in his  hand. “...No...” His eyes dilated as the magical energy was completed  and was overwhelmed by sudden blackness when it blasted into his body  from the point blank range.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio-...kun...” Caro weakly raised  her hand from the ground before it was wrapped by red chains and pinned  to the dirt. “Elio-kun...” Her vision faded out when the binding spell  started sapping her energy. Through the dimming of light in her eyes  she watched Zest reach down and pick up Elio before slinging him over  his good shoulder and begin carrying him off. “No...No... Don't leave  me...” Her hand opened up slowly, trying to reach out to the  unconscious form. “Don't take him...from me...Don't...don't...” Her  vision hazed more as tears came, hand inching forward more against the  tightening bind. “My...Elio...” Her fingers relaxed, hand falling down  completely. Caro's eyes were closed, breath weak.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro!” Tia  slid down next to her and quickly shot the chains off her body. “Caro! Caro!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We can't stay here!” Subaru screamed as she jumped from her wing road and slid on the ground. “There are too many coming!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm scared to move her!” Tia frowned at the imprints on her jacket left from the crushing chains.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru  glared at the approaching small army of drones before glancing back at  her already tired partner and unconscious friend. “I don't have a  choice...” The girl reached into her pocket and pulled out two shotgun  sized shells, loading them into her fist weapon. “Vita-san...  Nanoha-san...” Her hand gripped tightly. “I trust in your training...”  Her eyes looked up towards the opponents. “Load cartridge!” The glove  exploded with energy, grinding and spinning with the new power. “LOAD!”  Two shells shot from the release valve. “Divine...” The energy screamed  around her. “<em>Buster</em>!” She thrust her hand forward, blasting all  the compressed energy at once. Dirt caved in under her as the force  buried her boots into the ground underneath her. The attack lasted all  of seven seconds before fading away and revealing nothing but falling  debris from the drones.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru...” Tia whispered softly, too  shocked to do anything else as her partner quickly yanked off the  overheated glove and looked at her blistered hand. “Those were...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A-class  shells...” She confirmed, panting. “Nanoha-san taught me how...Vita-san  told me the conditions to use them...I think this qualified...” She  tried to move her fingers but grunted in pain. “But my device...” She  looked sadly at the obviously cracked and broken glove.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is everyone okay!?” Nanoha called out to them as she and Fate landed. “What was that blast?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro's hurt!” Tia instantly called out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Scan of the area!” Fate commanded Bardiche. “Where is Elio, he should be doing this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio...?” Subaru suddenly stood and looked around. “You're right, I don't see him!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio!?” Tia called out, turning around in circles. “Eliooooo!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate swallowed when her scan came back free from all enemy threats but also clean of friendly targets. “Rein! Where is Elio!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't...see him...” Rein's voice told her as a screen appeared. “Mistress Hayate, requesting a larger scan!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Already  ahead of you,” Hayate's image appeared as well, quickly typing. “Shari,  double scan!” The group held their breath momentarily before the beep  came to signal the end of the process. “Neither the scanner nor his  personal tracker can locate him...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What happened...?” Nanoha  cradled Caro in her arms. A few seconds went by before she shook her  head quickly. “Rein, send a medical team! Prepare for an unconscious  person and,” She looked at her team. “Minor injuries as well!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blond of the group looked up into the sky sadly. “What happened...Where are you, Elio?”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha: Caro has yet to wake up after the attack, but her device has given us the data that we needed...
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate: Elio was taken by the enemy, why or where we do not know.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia:  Our mission was a failure. The sick feeling won't go away, no matter  how much praise I received for making the correct leadership decisions  on the battle field.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru: My glove was destroyed, my precious  memory of my mother. I'm sad, but right now I can not allow myself to  think about it. One of my team is missing, and its my job to protect  them all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha: I won't give up, no matter what. Fate and I  will rescue you, Elio, so hang tough until then. My newly awoken power  will be used to rescue those precious to me!</span></p>
