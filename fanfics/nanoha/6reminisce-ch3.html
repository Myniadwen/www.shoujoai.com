<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I could feel  the pain almost immediately after I regained consciousness. My entire  upper body hurt something fierce but thankfully I felt bandages already  wrapped around me, a sign that I had already been tended to. Bright  light stung my eyes when I tried to open them and I couldn't help but  groan out while placing a hand over them to prevent the blinding glow.  Once my eyes adjusted to the room I moved my hand and looked up at the  ceiling. I didn't recognize the view so I decided to look around the  room to get my bearings. The immediate area didn't seem familiar to me  either, not did I see Shamal or anyone else around me for that matter.  As I sat up I realized that my barrier jacket had been removed and my  bare chest was covered with glowing green bandages paired with my  pajamas to cover my legs. “Hello?” I called out, wondering where  everyone was. Were they being debriefed right now? If so I should  probably head over there as well and give my input. I was currently in  a little cubby hole on the wall, just large enough for my bed and room  to take a few steps before going out into the main area. The ceiling  was low and all-in-all it kind of creeped me out. For some reason I  didn't want to stay in the room any longer than I had to so I slid my  feet off the bed and walked over to the entrance of my small recession.  The force was so sudden that I felt myself be jarred back and slide  across the floor a moment before I stopped. A good portion of my body  stung lightly from whatever had just hit me, making me instantly go on  alert and look around more. '<em>Where am I?</em>' My eyes looked at the  area I was skeptically. Testingly I grabbed the pillow from my bed and  threw it, watching in horror as a field formed around the opening and  made the projectile fall limply to the floor. To confirm even more that  I obviously wasn't at my home base, the door across the room opened and  a purple haired girl walked in.</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio  watched the girl walk towards him casually and stand in front of the  invisible barrier keeping him retained. Lutecia was wearing a simple  purple dress that matched her light hair color and flowed carelessly  around her when she moved. “Elio,” She greeted him softly. “Welcome.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't really <em>feel</em> welcome,” he retorted at her. “Why did you bring me here?” Elio looked  around lightly, trying to plan an escape route. The thought made him  stop suddenly and look down at his bare wrist. “Where's Strada!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia held up her hand, showing that she was wearing his watch. “I'm sorry, we can't allow you access to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why am I here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Zest  overheard me say I wanted to see you, so he brought you to me.” The  girl bowed lightly. “I'm sorry it happened this way, would you like to  be let out of there?” She didn't wait for an answer, instead waving her  hand in the air and disabling the field. Elio flashed around her  instantly, wrapping one arm around her neck and the other gripping her  wrist with his device on it. Lutecia simply leaned back against him and  blushed lightly at the contact. “Don't be rash, you can't leave the  base.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Give me Strada.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can not.” She felt his hold  tighten to the point of being uncomfortable. “If you want to embrace  me, please do not be so rough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm not 'embracing' you!” He  almost shouted at her. “You took me prisoner! I want out!” He tried to  form some magic in his hands but found that the energy wouldn't come to  his call. “What...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You have an AMF device planted on you,” She  told him softly, reaching up to pull on his arm a little so she could  breathe. “On your left ankle.” She felt Elio shift so he could look. “I  have the control for it, so you can not run.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Che,” Elio let her go and took a few paces back from the girl. “What do you want from me, Lutecia?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  told you,” She replied shyly, face tinted red. “I want you to be my  knight.” Lutecia walked forward to him and placed her hands on the  boy's cheeks. “Please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio looked down at the girl with a  confused expression. “...What?”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Fate,  pacing around won't solve anything.” Nanoha called to her after  watching her fiancée walk around the living room yet again. “Please  come to bed; Shari is working as hard as she can to track down Strada  and find Elio.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What if they're hurting him?” Fate bit her thumbnail while walking. “He's only ten, he can't handle this type of thing yet!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate!”  Nanoha got off her bed and flew down to her. “Get a hold of yourself!”  She gripped the blonde's shoulders. “If they wanted information they  would have gotten Caro-chan as well. If they wanted to torture it from  them, they would have gotten the female. I know it sounds cold, but  look at it rationally! We were told Lutecia took a liking to Elio for  some reason, and she wasn't at the attack, so there has to be a  connection!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like what?” She looked at her lover with pleading eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lutecia  wants Elio for something. For what, I'm not sure but I know it's not to  hurt him. I can feel it. Okay?” She hugged her. “Now calm down. It's  okay. We'll get through this, right? Just like everything before; Just  like when I was gone. It will all work out. Shhh...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate hugged her closer before taking a breath. “Thank you, I'm okay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  sure? Do I need to slap you one good time?” Nanoha smiled when Fate  couldn't help but give a half laugh at her joke. “Okay. To bed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's almost seven in the morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  we stayed up late doing research and had a scramble. Everyone is on  rest duty until we have more information. Currently all we have to go  on is Caro's device's recordings of the battle so until Shari calls us  with more news we need to rest, now sleep.” To stress her point Nanoha  scooped up her lover and carried her to the stairs. Once they were in  front of their bed she sat her down on her feet. “Strip.” The blue eyed  girl moved her hands up to summon a monitor and keyboard before typing  out the command to lower the blinds and block out the rising sun.  “Here, let me rub your back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you, I could really go for  that right now.” Fate fell onto the bed and sighed out when the hands  started to work out her tense muscles. “While we're talking, what's up  with you being in my old barrier jacket? Copying my moves too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That's...Well,” Nanoha wondered how to describe it. “You remember Skeith?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate frowned darkly. “No, Nanoha, I don't.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah...haha...”  The brown haired girl rubbed her back a little more before continuing.  “I'm sorry, stupid question. Well the truth is...I didn't really take  her over like I told Shamal...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What!?” Fate turned around  instantly and pinned her lover on the bed in one fluid move. “What do  you mean!? You promised me everything was okay!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It is, it is!” Nanoha waved her hand lightly in an attempt to make Fate ease up on her. “Heres the whole story...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  listened to the tale quietly while sitting on Nanoha's waist just to be  sure she couldn't go anywhere in the middle of it. When she was done  the blond closed her eyes sadly. “I see... So she went through a lot  like I did as well, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That's why I didn't want to tell you,”  Nanoha reached up with one hand and touched her cheek. “I didn't want  you to worry or hear anything that would remind you of the past.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's  a happy moment as well,” Fate told her gently. “It was during those  times where I could really start being myself, so, please don't hide  things from me anymore, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Okay. I'm sorry.” The two  girls embraced tightly a moment before she continued. “My Phase shift  is the ability I was given before she went to sleep. I can turn into a  copy of you and Signum as well I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate frowned playfully. “I don't want you to copy anyone but me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou,  you.” She happily giggled. “Come here,” Nanoha pulled her into another  hug and rolled her over so Fate's back was against her front. “Go to  sleep now, we'll continue later.”</span></p>

Elio  looked around as they walked down the hallways of the base he was  currently in. People walked next to him, giving the boy glances and  questioning looks since Lutecia was holding onto the sleeve of the  shirt he was currently wearing. Not being able to call his barrier  jacket, the red head was given what seemed to be a type of uniform. The  design matched those of who he saw but the colors were different. Black  sneakers covered his feet with light purple flashes scattered on them.  Moving up he wore equally as dark dress pants complete with a belt that  held a deep purple clasp. His chest was now covered by a dark crisp  shirt that he tucked in. A cross shaped dark purple design graced the  front of it and matching symbols were on his shoulders going down his  arms. A flowing cloak bellowed out behind him whenever he walked or got  a catch of wind. Although the cloak wasn't really part of his uniform,  it was still somehow held in place on his shoulders easily and from  what he could tell, no one else seemed to have one. His eyes went down  to inspect the outfit one more time, also glancing at his left ankle  where he knew the skin tight band was clinging to his body and  preventing him form using any of his magic.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you uncomfortable?” Lutecia asked him after they exited the building they were in and went outside.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,”  He told her honestly as he looked into the sky. “We're still on  Midchildra?” He gathered as much from the number of moons hanging in  the air and their familiar pattern.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We are,” Lutecia lead him to a building that had people walking all around. “The best place to hide is right under the nose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see,” His eyes scanned the area, noticing that they were on a very neat  and clean looking base. Several jeeps were driving around and more  people than he could count seemed to be moving around them on the wide  open grounds. “But surely we would have noticed-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We are on a  military base of Midchildra, one recognized by the TSAB as local  defense. Everything on the surface is real.” Her words were softly  spoken, catching Elio's ear easily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then how could...?” Elio's  voice trailed off when Lutecia entered in a rather long password on a  keypad next to a lone door. The entrance opened to them and the two  walked inside, only pausing to enter another password near the  elevator. Once it was accepted a panel slid out from under the normal  buttons, revealing a single new one. Lutecia pressed it and Elio found  themselves descending. “I get it, you're using it as a face to carry  out your operations right where we would never look...” His captor  nodded once to confirm this to him. “A perfect way to launder money to  get what you need... in a place where you can be out in the open about  one thing and secretly working on another...Brilliant...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  way, please.” Lutecia gripped his sleeve again and held it as she  guided him down a long hallway. Near the end a single man stood while  typing on various keyboards around him. “Doctor, I brought him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see, thank you Lutecia.” The man told her, voice deep with both appreciation and something Elio couldn't place.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  is this about?” Elio moved to walk forward but Lutecia gripped his  clothing harder so he chose not to. “Who are you and what do you want  with me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You sound so hateful, Elio-kun,” He laughed. “I only  wish to tell you the truth... As you so deserve to know as one of the  survivors.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Survivors...?” Elio lost his hard voice. “You mean from the fire those years ago? The one from the heating system malfunction?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  fire,” He began as he turned around to face him properly. Light purple  hair fell across his shoulders and yellow eyes met his. “My boy, is  that what they told you?” The man laughed to himself. “No, the fire  caused by the experiment taking place under ground... Project F.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Project F?” Elio wracked his brain, recalling the term used by Fate before but never hearing anything specific about it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  the continuation of the original Project F started by Precia  Testarossa.” A monitor appeared behind him, showing a small girl in a  large glass tube filled with liquid. “The first success was gone  unknown by most of the universe, but I found out.” Several more images  appeared, showing the tube being opened and the girl lifting her head.  The screen flashed to the girl wearing a dress while cheerfully  arranging flowers. Once again it flashed to reveal the girl in a black  and pink barrier jacket holding a scythe. “I believe you know her.” The  screen changed again before Elio could respond, this time showing Fate  at her current age during her last battle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What does this have to do with me...?” Elio's voice wavered lightly, wondering what he just saw.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because...” The man waved his hands, this time bringing up a single monitor. “You are valuable to me and my research.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio  looked at the monitor as the view on it got closer, revealing another  large tube with a boy floating in the middle of it. “No...” His eyes  went wide when the boy's head lifted up, revealing red hair. “No...”  All at once the tube exploded and the four year old boy landed in a  crouched position, eyes glowing as magic energy started collecting in  his hands. “NO!!!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Welcome home, Elio.” The lights flared around  him, illuminating the room and revealing several of the tubes around  the walls, each holding people of different age and gender. Elio spun  around, shocked, looking at the things around him. “You will learn of  everything you were created for. I will teach you to be what you were  originally meant to be!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who...who are you!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Scaglietti... Jail Scaglietti.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Caro  slowly opened her eyes, letting out a small gasp when she realized how  dry her throat was. She pulled herself up into a sitting position and  sat there for a moment, trying to recall what had just happened to her.  When the memory came back her eyes instantly darted around before  understanding that she was no longer on the battle field. With a hop  she got out of the bed and absently pulled the sheets back up to tidy  it. The pink haired girl looked around a moment before finding her  clothes on the nightstand by her bed and proceeded to quickly change  into them before moving past the white curtain around her bed and  looking for Shamal. The blond appeared a few moments later along with  Nanoha but before she could call out to them found herself being hugged  by her pretend mother.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro-chan! Are you okay? Do you hurt anywhere?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro looked  over at Shamal with a confused look and was rewarded with a glass of  water shortly afterwards. She took several long drink from it before  taking a deep breathe. “That felt good.” Her gaze turned back to  Nanoha, who was still on her knees to be at more level ground with her.  “Where's my Dragoon?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, first lets worry about you.” Shamal  moved over to her. “Caro-chan, you were asleep for almost two days.”  She allowed the shock to settle in before continuing. “I need to do a  quick check up before we get into anything else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Be  quiet Nanoha.” Shamal cut her off, taking Caro's hand and leading her  to a small stool to sit on. “I'm going to check her out first and  that's final.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't mind at all!” Nanoha pouted at her. “Mou,  I was going to ask you to; I just wanted to ask if I could talk to her  while you're doing it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The corners of the blonde's mouth turned up happily. “Yes you can.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“What's  going on?” Fate asked her monitor as she down shifted her car and took  an exit. Nanoha had just contacted her on her way to get their lunch.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro-chan woke up,” Nanoha smiled. “She's fine but hasn't been  able to give us any more information on Elio. She did, however, give us  some vital information about Zest.” The girl looked away a moment. “He  can use blood magic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>What</em>!?” Fate looked from the road to the monitor and back several times after almost swerving off the road. “But that's-!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know,” the monitor cut to sound only so Fate would pay more attention  to her driving. “The only thing more powerful than cartridges, but only  usable in a limited amount, as it takes your own blood to make the  spells that much more powerful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Christ...” Fate rubbed her temple with one hand. “I have a headache...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Uh oh,” Nanoha sighed out. “I have to go, Caro just summoned Freidliche back to her after I <em>told</em> her not to use her magic for a while.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  couldn't help but smile. “Don't be too hard on her, okay? I'll be back  in about ten minutes with dinner.” Fate shook her head, hearing Nanoha  scolding the young girl in the background, having forgotten to cut off  the connection.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Elio  looked up when the door to his room opened and Lutecia walked in. He  had been given a standard issue military room with a single bed, a  desk, and not much else. Lutecia had apparently refused for him to be  placed in a cell and was put in charge of keeping an eye on him. “You  look sad,” She spoke to him as she placed a tray of food onto his desk.  “You need to eat.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm not hungry,” Elio looked back down and sighed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did you  not wish to know the truth?” Lutecia sat beside him and attempted to  touch his hand but found him moving it away from her. “I thought this  would make you happy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Finding out I was created in a test tube  isn't really something pleasing,” He scoffed, looking at his hands.  “Its all clear now, though. I have no memories before then because I  wasn't even alive. After the accident in the lab I was found...  Scaglietti killed those parents in order to get me back but I was taken  into custody by Fate and they lost sight of me until now...” Elio  glared over at her. “And what about you? Where do you fit into all of  this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No where in your storyline,” She looked ahead of herself.  “The doctor can guide me to what I want, so until I can get it I will  work with him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And when you get it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I will leave.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And do what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't know,” Lutecia looked over at him. “I havn't thought that far yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you need from him?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Control.”  Lutecia held up her hands. “The gloves he made for me limit my power. I  used to have accidents where I would summon but not mean to...I hurt  many people.” Elio didn't say anything so she continued. “It was  related to my emotions, so I taught myself how to be passive, so it  won't happen as much as it used to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So that is why you are  always so perfectly calm...” He looked over at her again. “Is that all?  You don't have to stay here for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do,” She shook her  head. “Until he can make a device to control my summoning I can not  leave here.” Her eyes dropped a little. “My gloves are losing their  power... Soon they will become meaningless and I will no longer have  control.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What about now, when your gloves are off?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As  long as I don't get riled up, I can manage.” She looked at her hands.  “Self training, you could call it... Tell me... Is Caro-chan happy  where she is?” She changed the subject onto something besides herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio  looked at the girl as she turned to him, seeing a sudden sadness in her  eyes that he didn't place before. “...Yes. Caro-hime is happy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro...-hime...” Lutecia slowly brought up a hand and moved to touch Elio. “Could you call me...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lutecia.”  He took the hand in the air before she could finish her habit of touching his cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...I  understand.” She looked down sadly a moment before raising her eyes  back up at him, gently squeezing his hand. “You are under my care so  call me if you need anything. Your door will be locked so please do not  try to go anywhere. Your M2D is set to contact me directly so if you  want to talk-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'll be fine.” Elio took a breath, wincing at how  sad her voice sounded. “Thank you... for treating me kindly while I'm  here. I appreciate it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The words worked and the girl softened.  “Well then, you have a lot to think about, I'll be on my way.” Lutecia  gave his hand one final squeeze before standing and walking to the  door. “I... made this myself, so I hope you enjoy it...” With that she  went out the door and let it slide closed behind her, followed by a  soft clicking sound of the lock.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio looked over at the food on  the desk before walking over to it and sitting down. He had some kind  of seared fish with rice and a sauce, along with a bowl of soup. Even  though he placed the purple haired girl at one, maybe two, years older  than him, the presentation and smell were wonderful, as if she had been  practicing for a long time. Slowly he picked up his fork and cut off a  piece, eying it before putting it in his mouth and chewing. '<em>Wow, this is really good...</em>'</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Subaru?” Tia poked her head into the dorm room and grinned at her room mate sitting at the desk. “What you doing?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Being emo,” Subaru yawned as she pulled one ear bud from her ear so  she could pay more attention to her partner. A song from Linkin Park  was currently playing, being set on Tia's personal play list. “What are  you up to?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You still sad about your glove?” Tia pondered, standing behind her and rolling on her heels.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, thanks for reminding me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're welcome...” Tia leaned over her and sat down the freshly repaired and polished device in front of her. “Here you go!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wha...But...” Subaru looked it a moment, mouth hanging open. “It was... I mean...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  had Shari get on it right away.” Tia blushed lightly. “I stayed with  her during my free time telling her how you used it and what to upgrade  to fit you... that's why I havn't been around the past few days.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You...  for me?” Subaru slid on the glove and moved her fingers around in it.  “It fits so much better...” With a flex she opened up the cartridge  hatch and laughed happily. “It doesn't stick anymore!”A quick  inspection made her pause. “But... my shells won't fit in it, it's too  large...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia held up a small box and opened it, revealing shells  that resembled rifle bullets. “Nanoha-san and Vita-san agreed that you  were ready for them... so I made some for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia...” Subaru  took the offered box and was torn between hugging her and inspecting  her weapon closer. “I don't know what to say...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about 'thanks'?”  The red head put a hand on her hip. “It's really tiring making those things you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru  laughed. “That's my Tia.” Before her friend could stop her, she leapt  out of the chair and tackled the girl back onto the bed. “Thank you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“H-hey!” Tia stumbled and collapsed onto the sheets. “Owww, I hit my head.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He he he, I'm sorry.” Subaru started kissing her head in random places. “I'll make you better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop that!” Tia rolled her over and pinned the girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Frisky tonight?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You started it!” Tia blushed darkly. “This wasn't what I had in mind when I gave it to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that bad?” Subaru pulled her down so she was fully laying on her body. “I think things turned out okay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You would.” She pushed up lightly to look at her again. “Don't be sad anymore, I don't like it when your sad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia...”  Subaru softened and nodded. “Mm. I won't be. Because Tia is here to  look after me.” She hugged the girl close, ignoring the shy protest. 'T<em>hank you...Tia.</em>'</span></p>

“Fate-chaaaaaaan!” Nanoha called out with a super sweet voice from her kitchen.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What'cha need Sugar?” Fate called back just as sweetly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  makes you think I need something?” Nanoha grabbed her purse and slung  it over her shoulder as she walked into the living room and over to her  fiancée.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because you havn't called me '-chan' since we got  engaged.” Fate typed quickly, sparing her a small glance when she tried  to read over her shoulder. “Put your glasses on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I don't wanna...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha.”  The tone of voice made the girl pout but still reach into her purse and  take them out. “Better. If you don't wear them your eyesight will just  get worse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But even Shamal said I only need to wear them while doing desk work!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you're cute.” Fate smiled to herself before looking up at her fully. “Really, did you need something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can I borrow your car?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nope.” Fate went back to typing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh come on! My van's heater is messing up lately, I'll freeze to death!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's not <em>that</em> cold yet.” She shook her head. “No way, no how.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stingy!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure am,” She confirmed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'll do something for you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  looked at her, curious on what she could possibly do to promote loaning  out her baby. Nanoha smiled and leaned over, whispering in her. A few  moments passed before Fate's face went red. “Really?” She got a nod.  “Promise?” Another nod. “And I can pick it out?” A third and final nod.  “Keys are in my purse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yay!” Nanoha pecked her cheek and ran over to the purse, grabbing Fate's key ring. “Thank you, I need a stress relief!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wait,  what did you say!?” Fate stood up, suddenly having second thoughts, but  Nanoha was already out the door. “...What just happened... ? She did it  again! Grrr...” Fate flomped back onto the couch and crossed her arms.  “She just whispers in my ear and I get all fuzzy and the next thing I  know she has my car... So help me, if she scratches it...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Meanwhile,  Nanoha was already in the parking lot using the key to open the door  and slide into Fate's car. 'Mark two', as Fate called it, just came  back from the garage not a month ago after it's last mission where Fate  put several dents in it and even a crack. Now that it was fixed, she  added a few extra things to it and was very proud of herself. The broad  currently in the diver's seat didn't really understand most of what her  fiancée ranted and raved about in her car, but she did know that she  missed the wind in her hair and Fate's convertible was the only thing  she had that would simulate it when she wasn't in battle. '<em>Stupid non-flying laws,</em>' She growled to herself while pushing the button to make the top of the car convert down. '<em>I get scolded by Hayate all the time for flying even on the base. Why don't she just grant me constant flight permission?</em>'  Nanoha cranked the heat on as high as it would go and drove out of the  parking lot, speeding along the road leading into the city.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  long ponytail flipped out behind her as the wind picked up. She took in  a long intake of air and exhaled it happily, taking her time to enjoy  the day. All too soon she entered into the city, down shifting a few  times and slowing down enough to start looking around. Her actual  mission right now was her standard weekly patrol of the town. Lightsday  was her day, and she normally used it to casually explore the town and  learn new ways around as well as to do her grocery shopping. This time,  however, her eyes were extra sharp and were paying more attention than  normal, scanning everyone on the sidewalk for signs of anyone or  anything that may give her a clue as to where to find Elio. The girl  cruised around slowly, listening to the radio while driving nowhere  specifically. Finally she let out a depressed sigh and looked at the  clock. It was already getting close to dinner time, making her turn  around to drive towards Mount Fuji's to grab something to eat and  calling her patrol to a closure.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!” Yuuno's picture  appeared next to her, scaring the girl enough to jerk the wheel and  scare someone driving next to her out of his mind. “What's your  location?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno-kun you scared me to death!” She yelled at him. “Don't contact me like that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There's been a robbery in town related to a lost logia!” He counter yelled. “What's your location!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fifth and Oak!” She suddenly got serious. “Details?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Two  large gadget drones smashed into a shop that just got it's shipment in  for the week, apparently there was something resembling an item  classified as logia. There, GPS is up... hang that right!” Nanoha  turned the wheel sharply, cutting across two lanes and turning on the  siren after forming the top of her car again. “Left up there!” The girl  slowed down slightly to make sure the traffic stopped for her. Once  clear she floored the gas and sped onwards.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So why are you my guide?” She wandered, screeching a left when Yuuno commanded her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Everyone  else is busy so I decided to pull my weight, keep going straight, so I  have been scanning with my magic.” Yuuno grinned at the look he  received. “Don't smirk at me like that, I'm still able to do this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Never  doubted you.” Nanoha swerved once more at his command and shouted out  triumphantly. “Ah-ha! I have visual!” Her hand danced out beside her on  a newly formed keyboard. “Setting up... sending video stream.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Got  it.” Yuuno looked to his side. “Ugh, heavy armor drones. They're slow  but you'll need to hit them pretty damn hard to break their barrier and  thick armor.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can I unlock myself?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“After you breeched  your limiter last battle? You're lucky Hayate managed to keep you at  Double A!” He watched the girl blush lightly. “Mou. Sorry, you're going  to have to make do.” He started typing quickly. “I have green lights  set up far ahead of you so just get next to them and aim for the red  globe type area on their left side.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What's that?” Nanoha  skidded around cars and looked up ahead, realizing that she did have a  clear path for at least two minutes at her current pace.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Flight control area! Knock it down and they'll be grounded.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  rolled down her window and grabbed her necklace. “Raising Heart,  compact mode!” Her orb confirmed her and shifted into something that  resembled a hand gun but had the butt of a rifle to balance against her  shoulder. “Lock...lock...lock... locked on!” She shot a blast of pink  energy, ripping into the shield and cracking the area she was aiming  for. Three shots later and the spherical device faltered and crashed  onto the ground.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That one doesn't have it, just ignore and pursue!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Roger!” The girl swerved around a few cars and leaned back out the window, taking aim once more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“NANOHA!”  The shout made the girl rip back into her car and sharply skid to the  side, over into the other lane, and back again to avoid a once parked  car thrown at her by the device. “I say...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I saw it,” She  replied easily, once more leaning out the window. “Fine, if you won't  let me aim...” The girl pulled the trigger rapidly, breaking the shield  after a few hits and pelting the device's side four times before  hitting her mark and making it wobble and fall. “Jackpot!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Still immature as ever,” Yuuno sighed out. “I say, Nanoha, please be careful okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  will,” Nanoha blew him a kiss before hopping out of her car and running  around. “Civilians clear the area!!” She shouted out, twirling Raising  Heart into it's full staff mode. Several blast ripped into the drone,  shorting it out even more. With a leap to the side she avoided a  parking meter thrown at her and shot out the laser devices on it so no  magical power could be used. With the threat now defenseless she ran  around it and took aim for it's core, firing a charged shot that busted  through it's armor. Nanoha leapt forward and landed on it, shooting  several more blast inside the hole to get the insides. Seconds later it  started sparking and blew up, sending the flying with the recovered  crate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha's boots slid on the ground and after a little  wobbling managed to bring herself to a halt. Not wasting time, she  began charging up another attack at the end of her staff and look down  the road. Her eyes narrowed, focusing harder and finding her prey. She  found it speeding towards her and waited a while longer before shooting  a small blast and moving her staff upwards. The first blast landed just  in front of the speeding device and blew up, flinging the extra large  drone into the air. Nanoha grinned, already having her position and  charge to take it out and proceeded to do so. The energy caused her to  slide backwards slightly but still shot straight through her threat.  “Well,” She mused, standing up straight and smiling. “That was easy.”  The girl took two steps towards the case in front of her before the  drone in the air came crashing to the ground, right on top of Fate's  car.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Raising Heart was dropped instantly. The girl could do  nothing but hang her mouth open in shock for several seconds before  laughing nervously. “Oh... hehe, that's okay... I can have that  fixed...” The area in front of her lit up brightly as the sparking  drone finally exploded, taking the car with it. Slowly she brought a  trembling hand to her mouth and looked at the flames. Tears came to her  eyes as a visual monitor appeared next to the girl, revealing Yuuno.  “Yuuno-kun...” She looked at him, already crying. “I just want you to  know... when I die, you can have my stuff...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What!?” Yuuno  slammed his hands on his desk and leaned forward. “Nanoha, are you  okay? Are you hurt!? Do I need to get a medical team out there!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  shook her head slowly. “No...I'm going to live for another few  hours...I just want you to know: you're my best friend in the world and  I love you lots and lots...and take care of Caro-chan for  me...And...and...” She fell to her knees and sobbed out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  happened!? Nanoha what's going o-” He paused when Nanoha turned the  screen to reveal the flaming remains of the black convertible. “-oh my  god, Fate is going to <em>kill</em> you.”</span></p>
