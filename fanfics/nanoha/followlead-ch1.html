<p><em>A/N: This is my half of the writing exchange with RadiantBeam for  which she wrote &quot;Pain to Pain.&quot; She wanted to see the conversation  between Nanoha and Fate which would take place after the conclusion of  her Lutecia/Vivio story, &quot;Daddy's Little Girl,&quot; which means that I've  now bookended that story (since my &quot;Mothers and Daughters&quot; is the story  of Nanoha and Fate's conversation </em>before<em> &quot;Daddy's Little Girl.&quot;  Frankly, I owe a good two-thirds of my NanoFate story ideas to  RadiantBeam, so I hope she keeps up her Cia/Vivio series just so I can  keep getting ideas!!</em></p>

<p>Fate  T. Harlaown smiled warmly as she watched her daughter Vivio lead  Lutecia Alphine off by the hand. The two of them made such a cute  couple. Lutecia was four years older, which might cause a few rough  patches for the next half-decade or so, but given how Vivio had been so  dead-set on the violet-haired summoner since their first meeting it  wasn't at all surprising that they'd ended up where they were,</p>
<p><em>She acts more like Nanoha,</em> Fate thought, <em>but her feelings are just like mine.</em> Fate had fallen in love with Nanoha from the very start. Nanoha had  been her first and best friend, but the intensity of those feelings had  gone far beyond &quot;friendship.&quot; Then when after a few years she'd grown  up enough to appreciate that love had a physical as well as emotional  side, it hadn't particularly surprised her that she felt <em>those</em> kind of things for Nanoha as well. Vivio had been just the same, only  since she was more assertive than Fate she'd taken the lead and gone  right after what she wanted without hesitation.</p>
<p>Standing next to her, Nanoha let out a little sigh.</p>
<p>&quot;I  take it things went well?&quot; Fate asked. Her wife had been a bundle of  nerves about the relationship, so Fate had advised that she needed to  talk it out with Lutecia, woman to woman.</p>
<p>&quot;She's a straightforward girl.&quot;</p>
<p>Fate agreed, &quot;The quiet ones tend to be, once they come out from behind their silence.&quot;</p>
<p>Nanoha grinned.</p>
<p>&quot;You would know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,  I would,&quot; Fate said, grinning back. &quot;You nearly scared Vivio out of her  shoes, though. She was afraid your chat was going to mostly consist of  words like 'Divine Buster Extension' and 'Starlight Breaker.'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mou, her <em>too</em>?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Too?&quot; Fate barely suppressed a chuckle.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a moment, right at first, when Lutecia almost panicked and started summoning on me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really? <em>Cia</em> did? She knows you better than that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Vivio knows me better than Lutecia and you weren't surprised about her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Vivio was worried about a loved one. That messes up your judgment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yeah, like your Enforcer test.&quot;</p>
<p>Fate  blushed. When Nanoha had been critically injured on a mission, Fate's  worry about her had caused her to fail to Enforcer qualification exam  twice.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought we'd agreed not to mention that again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't recall any such agreement. You were probably laughing at my scary reputation too loudly to hear my answer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tease.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh I am, am I?&quot; She caught Fate around the waist and pulled her up against herself.</p>
<p>&quot;Nanoha, we're in the middle of the hall!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So?&quot;  she said huskily, her face so close to Fate's the blonde could feel  Nanoha's breath tickling her skin. She kissed Fate warmly, tugging  gently at her wife's lower lip with her own mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;It's  embarrassing! Anyone might walk by.&quot; Fate noted distantly that her  hands didn't seem to be listening to her any more than Nanoha was; one  was cupping the back of Nanoha's head while the other pressed against  the small of her back, pulling them even more tightly together.</p>
<p>&quot;I  have to prove to my wife that I'm not a tease.&quot; Her tongue flicked at  Fate's lips, seeking entry. Fate moaned softly, letting her mouth  flower open under Nanoha's. The brunette flailed with one hand towards  the nearby door, connecting with the panel that opened Hayate's office  on the third try. They staggered through, more or less dragging each  other out of the hall. The door slid shut behind them, and a minute  later the panel's green &quot;open&quot; light turned to red.</p>
<p align="center">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>&quot;So, why did Lutecia think you were about to blast her?&quot; Fate asked.</p>
<p>Nanoha groaned.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know where my shirt wandered off to?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hanging off the corner of that file cabinet,&quot; Fate said. &quot;About Cia...?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mou, you Enforcers are tenacious!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's our daughter's happiness,&quot; Fate pointed out.</p>
<p>Nanoha shifted her weight off her wife and went in search of her missing clothes.</p>
<p>&quot;She'd  come to give her latest mission report and she hadn't bothered to  report to Medical yet. Pain and post-mission stress had her jumpy to  begin with, and having me surprise her didn't help.&quot;</p>
<p>Fate decided  that Hayate's desk blotter wasn't quite as comfortable as it had seemed  five minutes ago and stood up. This was one sore back she definitely <em>wasn't</em> taking to Shamal!</p>
<p>&quot;So what <em>did</em> she say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She  was mature about it, which is kind of a relief and kind of not, since  the age thing is my main problem with the entire concept. But I am sure  that it's not just a crush on her side. Where's my skirt?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Coat rack.&quot; Fate paused. &quot;So...are you okay with this now?&quot;</p>
<p>Nanoha sighed.</p>
<p>&quot;No, not really,&quot; she admitted.</p>
<p>&quot;No?&quot;</p>
<p>She gave Fate a game smile.</p>
<p>&quot;What  can I say? I'm not comfortable with the idea that our little girl is  growing up. I guess in my heart she'll always be the five-year-old who  looked up and called me 'mama.' I <em>really</em> don't want to imagine that some day she'll be the one...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Trying to figure out where all her clothes ended up after a quickie in her boss's office?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Y-yeah,  that,&quot; Nanoha flushed. &quot;But...I'm okay with the fact that it's me who  has the problem, not Cia or Vivio, and I trust that Lutecia won't let  Vivio do anything that she's not ready for, even if she thinks she is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you think that?&quot; Fate asked, not disagreeing but curious, since Lutecia definitely was the follower of that pair.</p>
<p>&quot;Because  she loves Vivio,&quot; Nanoha said simply. &quot;Just like my Fate-chan loves me  and knows when to put her foot down when she has to. Such as when I'm  worrying myself sick about our daughter's relationship.&quot; She gave a  heavy sigh. &quot;Thank you, darling, so much.&quot;</p>
<p>Fate smiled back at her.</p>
<p>&quot;You're welcome.&quot; <em>Just because I'll always follow after you doesn't mean that I can't point out the best way to go, after all.</em> &quot;I love you, Nanoha.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  love you too.&quot; The warmth in her expression held for a couple of  seconds, then changed to curiosity. &quot;Fate-chan, is that my hair ribbon  tied around your wrist?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Half of it. It broke, so the other half is still tied to the desk leg.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Vivio's Happy Family Magical Theater!</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Vivio-chan!&quot;</p>
<p>Vivio spun around, surprised.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Aunt Hayate! How are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mostly  okay. I was looking for you, though. Can you give this to Nanoha?&quot; She  extended a wrapped package decorated with a big red bow.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. What's the occasion?&quot;</p>
<p>Hayate grinned evilly. &quot;Just tell her it's for Guess What I Found In My Ficus Day. She'll understand.&quot;</p>
