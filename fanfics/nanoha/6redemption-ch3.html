<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My entire body hurt. Everything, everywhere, even places I didn't know could <em>be</em> hurt were throbbing. The only time I was ever in this much pain before  was when I first met Aura, many years ago, when most of my bones had  been destroyed. Actually now that I think about it, the thing that  caused me to be in this state was much worse. I remember it happening  but the pain was so great then that I couldn't even fathom it anymore  despite me having gone through it. To make the worst time in my life  merely the after effects, I knew it had to be bad. At least now it  wasn't searing pain that made me want to cry, it was as if my entire  body was bruised deeply. I knew this kind of pain, it was the result of  laying in bed for a long time after Shamal had her way with me. I loved  the girl so much, she was a second mother to me, but when she treated  me she would always use those needles...I hate needles and I could feel  an I.V. Line on the top of my right hand. First thing I would do when I  could truly move again would be to take it out. She knew I would do it.  I knew she knew I would do it, and if my arms were responding to me  right now, it would have been done. At that moment I felt my left hand  raised up and slender fingers rub my palm in a circle. It was Fate, I  could tell before I smelt her, before I even heard her voice. The  motion was old, always the same, always making me feel better. I knew I  was smiling and the hand paused a moment before continuing. Fate's soft  voice floated down to me, accusing me of being awake and requesting to  know if I was okay. Her scent hit me then; she must have just freshly  showered. It felt so much easier to move now, and I immediately opened  my eyes at her words. It was weird for a moment; I could smell her,  feel her, hear her, but for some reason I couldn't seem to <em>see</em> her. “Fate?” My voice was a little horse, but I didn't mind. “Where are  you, Fate?” She answered my question and I looked at the voice,  suddenly scared again. “Fate? Take this off my eyes, I want to see  you.” It was quiet a moment and slowly I heard her say that nothing was  covering my eyes. I trusted Fate with my life but I still removed my  hand from hers and brought it to my face. I was shaking. Hard. Indeed  there was nothing covering my eyes, but still I could not see.  Everything was a dark inky black. No shapes, no blobs, no spots,  nothing. Just black. Nothing but black. “Fate?” My voice broke. “I... I  can't see, Fate.” It was silent again, only a short moment, before my  lover's voice screamed louder than I ever heard her before, demanding  Shamal come to her straight away. “Fate?” I could feel tears start to  come, my shock ending quickly. “I'm scared, Fate.” Her name had always  given me confidence before, even coming from my own lips. But right  now, in this darkness, I felt more alone than ever. “I'm scared,” I  repeated, words getting weaker as more tears came. “I'm scared... Fate  I'm scared...” I was being embraced, but I took no comfort. “Fate...” I  was crying in earnest now, gripping her so hard I knew it hurt. “I'm so  scared...”</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha,  calm down sweetheart,” Fate placed her forehead against her fiancées as  spoke close to her lips. “Calm down, take a few breaths. Shamal needs  to check you out okay?” She felt Nanoha take a few slow breaths and  after a moment slowly nodded. “Good. I'm right here, don't worry. I  have to let go of you now but I'm right beside you okay?” Again another  scared nod and Fate slowly pulled away. At once the girl in the bed  went stiff, losing most of the confidence she had just built up. “I'm  here,” The words made her calm down only slightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Move your  fingers for me please,” Shamal requested gently, watching as the  request was carried out. “Now curl your toes...Great. Can you feel  this?” She lightly pinched a finger on both hands and then her feet,  getting small nods. “Open your mouth, I'm going to put a magical  reading thermometer in under your tongue all right?” She did open her  mouth but closed it instantly when she felt something touch her lips.  “Just me, Nanoha-chan, just me. Open. Open for me. Under your  tongue...Thank you. Now here's the hard part. Open your eyes for me.”  Shamal took a penlight from her lab coat and shined it into Nanoha's  bright blue eyes. “If you can see a light, follow it.” She moved it to  the far left and held it there. Moments later Nanoha's eyes slowly  drifted that direction. “Again.” She moved it above her head and held  it. The girl seemed confused a moment, looking around in all directions  before finally looking up and holding her gaze there. “I'm going to  take the thermometer from you now.” When her hand touched the device  the girl jerked in surprise even though she had just been told to  expect it. “You followed my light, did you see it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kind of?”  Her voice was shaking. “I saw... like if your eyes are closed in the  dark and someone cuts on the light, I saw that.” She reached out.  “Fate? You're still there right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.” The blond took her hand instantly. “Shamal, Will she be okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm no specialist but it sounds like the cones in her eyes were damaged...I need to do some test.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Tests</em>!?”  She almost screamed. “Screw the test, tell me if I'm going to see!”  sitting up, she looked around. “Shamal! Tell me I'm going to be all  right! Tell me there's some healing spell you can cast!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha, dear, calm down.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I will<em> not</em> calm down! I can't see!” Nanoha looked around more, moving her hand and  pulling the IV line from herself. “Ow!” she held her hand in shock and  realized that she had just hurt herself. The room went quiet, the only  sounds being the hard panting coming from the brown haired ace.  “...Shamal?” She got a soft reply. “Are the lightning and stars members  okay?” Again a soft confirmation. “Is anything wrong with me besides my  eyes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Long story, but you are okay.” She looked at the  thermometer in her hands. “Your linker core is half it's normal energy.  I had to do surgery on you when you got back three days ago, the jewel  seed grafted on your body was shifted by whatever attack hit you. It  healed itself while I did whatever else I could for you but your  stitches are already out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I want to go home.” She whispered the words. “I don't want to stay here. Please, Shamal, let me go home.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...I'll let you go if you let me take pictures of your eyes. It won't hurt, nothing will touch you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Okay.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Nanoha  woke up,” Yuuno said the moment he opened the door to Hayate's office.  His short friend stood up immediately but he closed the door behind  himself. “She's also blind. Shamal just told me.” This time Hayate  scrambled from the desk and ran over to the door, being caught by the  male. “I already tried, they locked themselves into their apartment,  right now Nanoha just wants to collect herself. Fate said Nanoha will  talk to everyone later, just not right now.” He allowed the girl to  embrace him tightly, shivering. “Hayate... This isn't the first time  someone has survived an attack from The Azure Flame, but something is  different about this.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you mean?” She pulled him over to the couch and sat down. “I thought he had a one hundred percent success ratio?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He  does, or at least did, just in a different way. You see; to him 'death'  is the existence without power. He lives to fight, and when he wins a  battle, he doesn't take the person's life, but instead something else:  Their linker core.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate gasped. “You mean like I-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, no!” He shook his head. “There's a difference in your ability to drain magic and this. You see, The Azure Flame actually <em>takes</em> the linker core. Completely removes it from the person so there is no  way for them to ever use magic again. The process is called “Data  Draining” it seems. They named it such because he also takes all the  information, or data, from the victim's device and uses it to farther  better himself. Skeith used a similar attack, the principle the same:  She would drain information and magic from her victim but would have to  'phase shift' into it to be able to access this power. Her version is  corrupt and incomplete so she can't permanently hurt people nor does it  have any ill effects on her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So this Flame person... Does he have ill effects.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  very bad ones.” Yuuno clicked on a monitor and darkened the room.  “Tri-Edge uses a very advanced type of weapon. See his twin daggers?  They are actually two devices. Velkan in nature but still different.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Know  how we can make different levels of cartridges? Everything from small  pistol bullets up to over sized shotgun shell types?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course,  I just approved the advancement of the forwards to use standard  rifle-type shells as their main ammunition.” Hayate nodded as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  Tri-edge uses something more powerful than our triple-S shells like the  ones that Nanoha and Fate only keep one of because of their insane  magic draining requirements.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, whenever they make one they sleep for an entire day... How can someone possibly make something more powerful than that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He doesn't.” Yuuno looked down. “Remember how I told you he steals literal Linker Cores...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She gaped, bringing a hand to her mouth. “He can't...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He  loads the core into his weapon and infuses it into his body, just like  our Aces would do to keep heir barrier jackets on when inside of an  AMF. We get an explosive amount of temporary magical power. He on the  other hand...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Gets his mage rank boosted up however many levels  of the core he uses...” Hayate spoke the words no louder than a  whisper. “Nanoha couldn't touch him and she was unhindered by a  limiter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I place his normal powers to be around S. Loaded with  a Linker Core, say another S, he wouldn't just get SS, he would  literally double his power. This enabled him to defeat Nanoha, even  with her third phase shift: Skeith, which is un-officially ranked  triple-S. But there's more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“M<em>ore</em>!?” She cried out. “I can't take much more...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This really scares me.” He fast forwarded to a certain part in the battle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  you too possess an avatar. This makes things interesting.” Kite's voice  came into the room. With a little more fast forwarding, he played it  again. “We are we.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't understand...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno turned to her. “How are you and Rein doing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate gave him a confused look. “We're okay I guess.” When he raised an eyebrow at her, it clicked. “Unison!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The same as Nanoha.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Jewel seed!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“An  'avatar' as he called it. Hayate, what we are fighting against isn't  someone who came across a jewel seed and figured out that it was made  from a human...These people <em>made</em> the originals in their un-flawed state.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha  is a sitting duck against something like that! As soon as he realizes  that Nanoha still has her linker core he'll come for her again, taking  us out as well... Wait a second, you said there was a ill-effect of  this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mana Burn.” Yuuno smiled without humor. “Just like when  someone loads a cartridge and channels it into themselves instead of  their weapon. If it's not used, it makes the user sick with too much  power; normally making them bed ridden for a while until their body  regains it's normal magical flow. Also causes pain and discomfort. If  you get that from a single shell, imagine what a core will do to you. I  researched it; When Tri-Edge, The Azure Flame, Kite, whatever you want  to call him, makes an assassination he isn't seen anywhere for almost a  week.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Recovering from Mana Burn?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno nodded. “And that's when we strike.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But Nanoha is-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Going  to Earth with the forwards and Fate. We should go for a while as well  just to make sure they get settled in and have everything they need.  After that we can come back here and continue planning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly  the female nodded. “Okay, let's talk more later. Thank you for the  briefing. Now...” She took a long slow breath. “Too many questions...  you said Nanoha was blind, right? Give me more details please.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“How  are you?” Fate whispered softly, gently massaging Nanoha's back in the  shower. She didn't bother with the forest illusion this time, Nanoha  wouldn't be able to appreciate it anyway and she only liked it because  her lover did. No answer came to her, making the blond even sadder. “I  can't imagine what it's like,” She tried again, weighing her words  carefully in case Nanoha decided to go from sad to raging at the drop  of a hat. “But I'll be here to walk with you through it all. It's all I  can do, so please, if you want to cry or scream or anything I'll  listen.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, Honey?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha turned to look  at her. “Are my eyes funny looking?” She felt her cheeks be embraced  and Fate's nose touch hers. Seconds passed by as she was observed,  holding her breath.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, they are still a very pretty blue,  there's no telling anything at all is wrong. Even if they were, your  eyes would still be lovely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I just realized...” She ran her  hands along Fate's body, searching for her neck and then touching her  cheeks as well. “ I'll never be able to see your eyes again. God, Fate,  I love your eyes. No one has red eyes but you, I always enjoyed looking  at them... at you... at anything...” She started crying again but the  spray of the showers didn't let the blond know. “Now... Now I'll never  see it anymore... You, Hayate, Yuuno, Subaru, Tia, Elio, anyone,  anything!” Shoulders shaking, her breath started getting heavier. “I'll  never see anything anymore!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't say that!” Fate gripped her.  “It isn't definite yet. You can see light, that means your not  completely blind. Just wait until Shamal gives us the word. Until then,  have faith. I'll take care of you every day I promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm  sorry,” She tried to calm down. “I'm just so scared...I, I don't even  know how to turn off this water if I wanted to... I don't know what way  I'm facing...Do I walk left to get out of the shower or right? Then how  do I get a towel? How do I <em>dress</em>, how can I even cook something if I'm hungry!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha,”  She embraced her. “I'll help you. We'll get through it. We've been  through a lot of things, this will be one of them we look back at years  down the line and we'll be even more thankful we're together and fine  then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How am I fine? How are the forward fine?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They  were knocked out more than anything else,” She explained softly. “He  wasn't trying to kill them so a little healing magic and a day's rest  set them back in shape. You, on the other hand, had two hours of  surgery. I was told your jewel seed mended itself and Shamal fixed what  it couldn't. Said it was a medical miracle, one we're thankful for. Do  you hurt?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, but nothing too bad. I'm weak but alive...” The  conversation died off, leaving them sitting in the shower together for  a few more moments before Fate reached out and cut the water off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come on,” She encouraged her. “Let's get you dried off and into bed.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Earth?”  Fate asked, looking back and forth between Yuuno and Hayate. “What's  this all of a sudden? We have a mad man on the loose out there, we need  everyone we can here! Why isn't anyone out looking for him? What if he  hurts someone?” The blond shook her head amazed. “None of this is make  any sense at all.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate,” Yuuno took a breath. “There's something you need to know. The mage Nanoha fought, Kite, is an assassin.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” She instantly got deathly serious. “What do you mean assassin? As in someone payed to kill someone? Who?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate looked at the ground a moment before replying. “Us. All three here and Nanoha.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Why</em>?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Long  story short, the U.F.Q. Took interest in the 6th division after you  killed Jail Scaglietti. They wanted Hayate's leadership skills, your  teaching ability, Fate's power, and my knowledge. When we turned them  down they sent someone to make sure we couldn't be used against them  anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate stared at the two for a long while. “You knew this  before now didn't you?” Her voice was soft, shocked. “Why? Why didn't  you tell me?” Walking forward, she slammed her hand down on Hayate's  desk and leaned over. “Why didn't you <em>tell</em> me someone was trying to kill us!? If I had known I could have-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That's  why!” Hayate yelled back at her. “Because you would have! He tossed  Nanoha around like a rag-doll! There's no chance of beating him when  he's like that, you could have died!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Better me than someone else!” Fate screamed into Hayate's face. “I had a <em>right</em> to know!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate  tried to remain calm. “If you knew Nanoha was in danger you would have  flown out there to battle that very second. I couldn't risk you acting  rash.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha?” Fate hit the desk again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I knew you would be mad if she was in danger.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate's  hand acted before she even realized what happened. Hayate's face jerked  to the side, a loud clacking sound rang from the blond's slap.  “Nanoha?” The word shook as she glared into Hayate's eyes. The short  girl slowly brought a quivering hand up to touch the rapidly redding  cheek. “You think I'd be upset and mad just for her? Hayate, do you  value our friendship so little?” She shook off Yuuno's hand on her  shoulder. “You think I'd risk my life only for her? You think I'd hear  about an assassin and instantly try and protect just her? Did you even  stop and <em>think</em> for a moment that I'd want to protect <em>you</em>!? To protect <em>Yuuno</em>!?”  She kept her eyes fixed on the smaller girl's. “This risked the lives  of my friends, of the people I care about! Just because I'm <em>in</em> love with Nanoha doesn't mean I don't love you as well, or Yuuno any  less than that! Damn it, Hayate if anything happen to you two I would  act rash alright! I would hunt him down and kill him in his sleep! I'm  not mad because you kept a secret from me, I'm <em>pissed</em> that you  think I would act rashly only to protect one person who's being  targeted! We should have been working on this together!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  brown haired girl could only look down, eyes watering. The red eyed one  growled walking away over to the couch, falling down on it and crossing  her arms angrily. “I'm sorry,” Hayate finally spoke, slowly walking  over to the couch. “I heard you were being targeted, I only thought  about keeping you two together. You've been through so much the past  year I didn't want anything else to happen. You mean the world to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  I didn't feel the same way, I'd be tempted to really hurt you,” Fate  told her, glaring. “Luckily I'm not hard headed so I'll forgive you on  one condition.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What's that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Forgive me for slapping you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  deserved it.” Sitting down, she gave the blond a hug and got one in  return. “You could have slapped Yuuno instead tho, that really hurt.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate couldn't help but give a short laugh. “Okay, I'll hit him next time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“H-hey!”  The male stopped his path to the two girls, unsure if he should get  near the other blond. “If it was anyone else but you, Be sure I would  have hit whoever slapped her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's natural to protect the ones  you care about,” Fate pulled away from Hayate and wiped her eyes.  “Okay, this Earth thing: I refuse to go unless you come too. I'm not  going to run and hide but I'll go if it means the others will stay  safe.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno finally sat on the other side of Fate. “All of us  will go, except the Cloud Knights. There is no record of Kite purposely  harming people he has no reason to. He let the Lightning members as  well as Signum and Vita off without much trouble so until we can work  out a plan and let Nanoha recover it will be best to stay in a place no  one will get caught in the crossfire. Once we have a plan we'll come  back and toast this guy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay. Does anyone else know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only  you. We wanted to wait and see how Nanoha would take it. Speaking of,  will she talk to anyone yet?” Hayate twiddled her thumbs. “We're all  really worried you know...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate gave her a soft smile that held  no happiness. “She's a wreck. Her hands are shaking really bad, I had  to rub her back for almost half an hour before she went to sleep. If we  could wait a while before telling her we were going to move a while I  think it would be for the best.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Three days,” Yuuno answered the look Hayate gave him. “Any more than that and we could be pushing another attack.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay.  Well, I need to get back before Nanoha wakes up. I'll ask her if she's  up to speaking to anyone and if so I'll contact you alright?” Two nods  greeted her and she was walked to the door by her male friend. “Oh, and  Yuuno?” She looked up and over her shoulder at him. “What I said to  Hayate earlier, the same goes for you as well, I hope you know that.”  After a short pause he nodded at her. “Tho if it was you, I think I  would have kept my fist closed instead of a slap, so watch your butt  and don't make me mad anytime soon okay Babe? Good.” She left then,  leaving him to wonder if he had really been forgiven for his  foolishness or not. The path to the residential area was made quickly,  several small raindrops starting to tap onto her still slightly damp  from shower hair. '<em>What a day to rain,</em>' She grumbled, shivering in the freezing cold. '<em>I'm probably going to have a cold now</em>...'  Closing her door she sighed out happily as the warm air rushed over her  body. Seconds later a scared voice called out her name, making Fate run  to the stairs. “Nanoha? What's wrong?” The girl in the bed jerked  around to the sound and reached out a hand, crying openly. “Hey, don't  cry, I'm here.” Fate held onto her, rubbing the girl's back as she  sobbed out, trembling. “What's wrong Sweetheart?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm just...scared...” Nanoha held onto Fate tighter. “I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... I know I'm acting like a child but-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha, shush. You are not, don't say that. You can't see, I can't imagine what it's like but I would be terrified as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm  thirsty,” She spoke against the blond's chest. “My throat hurts but...  the thought of walking downstairs, even though I've done it countless  times, I don't know where I'm going... How could I even pick out a soda  from the refrigerator? I just... I mean...I'm so helpless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shh.”  Fate stroked the long hair on her lover. “I'm here for you, I'll get  you whatever you need so just ask. I'll hold your hand when you walk  and tell you whatever you need to know. Now, let's get you a drink and  we can talk. I'll be right back, don't worry.” After getting a small  nod Fate quickly ran to the kitchen and grabbed Nanoha's favorite soda.  Back upstairs she popped the top and placed it into her hands, watching  Nanoha feel around for the opening before bringing it to her lips and  drinking almost half of it on the first go. “Better?” She had calmed  down noticeably, no longer shivering. “Good... because I have some  unpleasant news about the guy we fought...</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Okay,”  Fate began after taking a steadying breath. “We're being re-located for  a little white,” She gave the information to settle into the five  people in front of them. “A very powerful mage has been hired to  assassinate Hayate, Yuuno, Nanoha, and myself. Until Nanoha is in  fighting condition again we are going to protect her at the relocated  place. For safety reasons, as her students, you will come with us.  During this time we will come up with a battle plan that more than  likely will involve all of you. Also we will still be taking out mage  tests so training will not be interrupted very much. However, I do  realize that we have been working non-stop for almost a year now and no  one has put in the allowed forty days of leave. As there are only a few  months left, this will also be a little vacation for you.” The students  seemed pleased at hearing this, giving Fate a small twinge to the heart  for lying to them. Truth be told she needed their 'time off for  vacation' to translate into 'taking care of Nanoha when she wasn't  available to do so'. Continuing, she finished up her speech. “Anyone  have any objections as to why you can't be relocated for a little  while?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru meekly raised her hand, getting nodded at for  permission to speak. “Um, my sister, Ginga, is having her birthday  soon... Is there any chance I can come here for one day for it? I was  planning on putting in leave for that...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate saw Nanoha go  stiff at the request. “I'm sorry,” The blond spoke after a moment.  “Once we're gone we can't come back here and then go back, it could put  the entire operation in jeopardy.” Subaru looked down sadly but nodded  anyway. “You may leave after this meeting to spend time with her if you  would like?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you, but she's currently out on a mission.”  The girl saluted Fate and met her eyes. “I knew when I signed up stuff  like this could happen, so I'm okay with it. Thank for the kind offer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anyone else then?” The enforcer pondered, smiling at Subaru's dedication. “...Okay, any questions? Elio?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where will we be going? A warship?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Non-administrated  planet ninety-seven, also known as Earth. Nanoha and Hayate's home  planet. Mine too if you really get down to it; same one where we went  when I asked Nanoha to marry me. We have a house there; rooming will be  tight for a while but I don't want us to separate into different  apartments.” The blond looked at them a little longer before nodding.  “Okay, that being said, we leave first thing tomorrow morning. Right  now they are five hours ahead of us so once there we can get something  to eat and get to out new apartment. Also it's summer time there, so  pack cool clothes.” She gave them another small moment and finally saw  Caro looking a little uneasy. “Something wrong, Caro?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um,  well,” She pointed to the side, where Freidliche and Shiva were  seemingly talking to each other. “I can't just leave them here...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She  has a point...” Fate whispered to herself, trying to figure out  something. “They can come because you need them to train with, but you <em>must</em> keep an eye on them. Absolutely no flying in town.” She got a happy nod in reply. “Last chance for questions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma'am, what about money? If it's a non-administrated planet...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  spoke up for the first time. “We have two civilian collaborators who  can exchange Earth money for things, don't worry about that.” She could  feel the people staring at her and if she hadn't just heard the voiced  being spoken she would have wondered if she was even facing the right  direction to speak with them. “So,” She began after a moment of  silence. “Dismissed.” The familiar sound of heels clicking met her ears  and she was sure she was being saluted. Just as she expected no sounds  of idle chatter or footsteps met her ears. Taking in a steadying  breath, she reached for Fate's hand and found it a few seconds later.  “Staying inside won't help me,” She told them. “I have to face this  sooner or later, sorry for avoiding everyone the last day and so...”  The questions came all at once, leaving her stammering to keep up with  everyone. Fortunately Fate came to her rescue after a few moments and  explained to them that Nanoha didn't really want to be bombarded all at  once. After assuring them she was not in physical pain, which was a  lie, they slowly departed to start preparing for the trip and leaving  the two alone. “Can we go home?” Nanoha asked after a moment's silence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hayate's  office is close,” Fate told her softly. “If you want to go back I'll  take you, but if you think you can make it we really need to see them.  Yuuno and Hayate are worried sick...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay.” She nodded despite  obviously not wanting to. “Let's go then,” Taking two steps forward,  she felt Fate squeeze her hand and gently pull enough to get her to  stop.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This way...” Fate almost whispered, moving so Nanoha  turned so she was facing the opposite direction and lead her to a  building. “Um,” She stopped walking and wondered how she should go  about leading her friend. “Stairs to the front door.” Nanoha slowly  moved forward, reaching out her foot until it touched the first step.  Now with it in mind she stepped up on it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This isn't so hard,”  She told Fate, looking over to her as the two made their way up the  small stairway. Before Fate could agree they made it to the top where  the blind girl tried to step up again, making her over balance. Her  back foot already lost it's foundation, making her toe hit the step in  front of it. With a small startled cry she fell forward, getting caught  by Fate before she could hit the concrete. Although it was a simple  trip it seemed to really mess Nanoha up, making her pant with wide eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha... It's okay. Everyone trips on stairs, this has nothing to do with your vision.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes it <em>does</em>!”  She countered her, voice going into a scream without really meaning for  it to. “Am I so helpless I can't even go up stairs even <em>with</em> someone holding my hand!?” She pulled away from Fate's grip and turned  to where she thought the direction for the door would be but ended up  walking into the middle hand railing on the stairs and had to grip it  to keep from falling over. Her eyes were still wide, gripping the metal  tightly. “I'm... not even where I thought I was...” She could feel  herself losing it again and quickly tried to press down the feeling.  “No,” She spoke her thoughts aloud in an attempt to calm herself down.  “I'm strong... I'm strong... I can handle this...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, you  can.” Fate told her gently, placing her hands onto Nanoha's shoulders.  “You're a tough cookie, but even cookies need guidance sometimes. Take  my hand.” Sliding down her arm, Fate re-took her friend's fingers.  “We're going this way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can make it on my own...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  could,” Fate told her, meaning it. “But I'm here with you. You can go  alone when you're alone. When I'm here, I'll be with you so don't push  me away.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate...” She looked down, closing her eyes for a  moment. Despite not being able to see she couldn't keep them closed for  long and after a moment opened them back up, looking in the direction  Fate would be in. “Okay, I'm ready. Sorry for the delay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's  not the first time we've made them wait on us,” She teased back,  getting Nanoha to actually smile lightly. “Let's go before it starts to  rain on us again, I'm getting cold.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  day of departure came quickly for the two girls, having gone to bed a  lot earlier than normal. The sun couldn't seem to find it's way through  the thick winter storm clouds and gave the room a dark appearance  despite being the time they normally woke up. Fate arose silently,  reaching up to cut off Bardiche's beeping sound. She almost never used  her alarm clock and found the the tone to really be quite annoying.  With a light yawn she rubbed her eyes before stretching out widely. The  house smelt like it had for the past few weeks, of gingerbread and a  type of scent that Fate could only describe as 'Christmas like'. She  was torn between being excited or depressed about returning to Earth  for a while. On one hand she would be able to see her friends and  family but on the other she would be missing the winter time here. The  blond had always loved the cold and snow had a special place in her  heart as it was during a snow storm that she had her first kiss. The  memory made her look on her bed, realizing that the lump she thought  was Nanoha was actually the body pillow her lover slept with. “Nanoha?”  She asked softly, still not quite awake yet. To answer her call, the  sound of shattering glass came from downstairs and a sudden cursing  from her friend drifted up softly. Fate instantly crawled out of bed  and made her was downstairs as fast as she could without running.  “Nanoha, what's going on?” She asked as she walked into the kitchen.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Making  coffee,” Came the simple reply. “Be careful, I accidentally knocked  over a mug onto the floor. I'll clean it up once this starts to steep  okay?” She moved her hands out on the counter in front of her, patting  it every now and then as she searched. “Ah there it is,” She opened the  container's lid and took a long intake of air through her nose. “Yes,”  She confirmed aloud, reaching into the bin and taking the scooper.  Several beans were loaded into her grinder but more seemed to fall onto  the counter top. The blond noticed that there was coffee grins and  beans scattered all over the counter as well as a few on the floor,  where Nanoha's bare feet were inches away from the broken cup. “It will  be ready in just a moment, so go ahead and get dressed okay Honey?” Her  hands pushed the lid of the grinder down, but since it wasn't lined up  properly some of the dust leaked out of it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha,” Fate walked  to stand behind her directly, watching her feel her was over to the  thermos and carefully pour the grinds onto the filer above it. The  motion was simple enough but in the determination to be as careful as  she could the pour was slightly misplaced, ending up about a quarter of  the not fine enough grinds to go onto the counter. “Here, let me do  that.” Her hand reached out and touched her friend's.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>No!</em>”  The harsh word made Fate jump back, scared. “I'm doing this!” Reaching  out, she felt her way to the water pitched and winced lightly when she  touched the glass containing the ripping hot water. After finding the  handle she picked it up and used her free hand to feel for the thermos.  Once found she gripped it and started to pour it onto her beans. “Ow!”  She almost jerked when some of it flashed on her arm but she held it  steady, listening as hard as she could to the sound of it being poured  and stopped when it seemed it was full enough. “See? I can do this just  fine!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate wasn't even about to tell her she over filled it. “Nanoha, Kitten, I can just help so-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!”  She repeated again. “I make coffee! I do it every morning! And, and,”  She looked to where Fate's general area was. “You're supposed to be in  bed and the smell will wake you up and I'll bring you a cup and you'll  say 'Thank you Sweetheart' and I'll, I'll.” She started to falter with  her words.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, but I'm just saying, I can <em>help</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!” Nanoha shook her head hard. “This is what I <em>do</em>!  Fate cleans and cooks and I wake up early to get you coffee every  morning! I'm not a child, I don't need my hand held! I'm not going to  be a bur don to anyone, I can do this!” Moving to sit the pitcher back  on the heater, she stepped to the side and onto the broken glass. The  girl let out a startled cry of pain and jerked her foot up. The motion  made her grab the counter to steady herself and would have knocked over  the thermos steeping if Fate hadn't been there to catch it. “Ow...  Ow...” Carefully she patted the counter to find the water heater and  jerked her hand back when she accidentally touched the hot plate.  Rearing back, she almost brought her foot down again if Fate hadn't  been there to grab her. “...I... I can do this...” She said again, this  time unsure of herself. “Fate needs me to do this... I'm not a child...  I'm not going to be a burden...I'm not...I'm not.” Her words were  breaking as tears started coming down her cheeks. “I'm...Oh god...” She  put the pitcher down onto the counter and simply braced herself,  standing on one foot. “I-I don't even know where to step! H-How can I  get the glass from my foot when I can't even move to sit down and do  it!?” Choking, she bit back a sob. “I-I don't even really know where  I'm standing anymore!” Turning, she looked at Fate with a hopeless  expression. “I can't even make you coffee?” It was more of a statement  than a question and she had given up trying not to cry.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha...”  Fate gently wrapped her arms around her and lifted, carrying her two  steps to the side and sitting her onto the counter. “Let me see your  foot.” Moving her hands down, she kneeled and inspected the bleeding  area. “I'm going to touch you all right?” She didn't wait for and  answer and instead went about dabbing her finger against the blood to  make the glass stick to her instead of being embedded into her friend's  foot. “You have pretty feet,” She spoke up after opening a cabinet to  take out a small first aid kit. “I never noticed before. Why don't we  go get a pedicure later? With Alisa and Suzuka?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're not  going to say anything about my mess?” Nanoha whispered softly. “I know  I made one, and I didn't even finish your drink...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'll clean  it up and then we'll make coffee together.” After cleaning the area she  placed a bandage onto the foot. “Sit right there for a moment okay?”  She kissed the top of Nanoha's foot and started putting the kit away  before going to get the glass.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate, say something about what I'm doing...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?” She pondered as she worked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because I'm worthless... How could anyone want to take care of an adult who can't even make something to drink...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  I love her, and I'm not 'taking care of' anything,” Fate told her in a  caring voice. “We have to adjust to this. It doesn't have much to do  with our relationship, it's more about you personally, but I'm still  there.” Standing up, she started cleaning the counter now. “I told you,  you're not worthless. I don't love you any less if you didn't make me  coffee. Such a small matter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That's just it,” Nanoha hung her  head, no longer panicking but still obviously displeased with herself.  “It's such a small matter and I can't do it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  said you can't do it 'yet'. After all, Nanoha makes me coffee right?”  Walking over to her, she placed her hands onto the blind girl's  shoulders. “We just have to adjust, won't we?” Leaning forward, she  kissed her lips. “Remember when we first started living together? Was  it easy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't lie to me,” Fate scolded. “You know  it sucked.” This earned her a brief fleeting smile from Nanoha. “There  you go, you remember. We argued for days about cleaning, where we threw  out dirty clothes, me eating in the bed, you working while I tried to  sleep, me going behind you while you cooked and put your things in the  dishwasher before you were done with them...” Nanoha smiled again, this  time lasting longer. “Easy my ass; we changed a lot to match each other  didn't we?” She got a small nod. “This isn't exactly the same, but it's  close. We will adjust ourselves to match once more. You're not a burden  at all, so don't think that, not even for a moment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But... How can I-?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'll  help you. We'll learn how to do things, we'll put things in a specific  place so you'll always know where everything is, we'll get voice  activated stuff as well so you can use that, we'll... do lots of  things. Yuuno can research it for us, after all many many people live  alone that are blind and have great lives. If anything, I'll burden <em>you</em> sometimes by not putting things in the proper place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're never a burden!” Nanoha countered instantly, making Fate smile at her. “I love Fate! You could never burden me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I feel the same for you,” Leaning over, she touched her cheeks. “I'm going to kiss you again, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Never  ask,” She managed out before Fate moved to stand between her legs and  hug her. Their lips met softly at first but picked up at Fate's  insistence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,” she breathed out after a minute or two of frenching each other. “We have to stop before I get carried away.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha smiled to herself, this time feeling it. “Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For what Honey? Being myself? No need to thank me for that is there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't deserve you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well we could argue for hours on which one of us deserves which, but instead how about we make some coffee?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I just tried-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha,” The word made the other girl stop talking. “I said 'how about <em>we</em> make some coffee' didn't I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Fate...” Reaching up, she wiped her eyes quickly, giving the blond a large happy smile. “Yeah! Let's do it together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, so...” She looked around, suddenly realizing how helpless she was. “What do I do first?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Open  the cabinet above the stove and get out the filters...” She instructed,  swaying her feet since she was sitting on the counter. “Now get the  grinder and-” She smiled as the instructions were given.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Ready?”  Nanoha asked, cuddling up next to Fate as she was guided to the  teleporting area. The harsh wind blew around them, making everyone  shiver. “Man it will be <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">great</span></em> to be in warm weather again!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate  looked at Nanoha a moment before turning to Fate and receiving a  cheerful nod. “Alright then!” She told everyone around them, mood  suddenly boosted by knowing her friend was doing better about her  condition. “Let's go to Earth!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Next Time...
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate: Oh sweet merciful Elune, I forgot how <em>hot</em> it was here in the summer!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha: Oh shush, it feels great!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru: Hey,hey, Tia! Let's go explore the town together!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio: Eh? Three days off for a vacation? Seriously!?</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro: No fair, I want to go too!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate: Let's... Get to our house first at least...</span></p>
