I had to admit that I had wanted to do this for a while now, ever  since a few days ago when we were caught by Shamal before we ever  really started. At that time Fate had been the first to touch,  although I was equally to blame for the unnecessary rocking to  encourage her hands. This time however I seemed to be the aggressive  one, leaving a trail of kisses along my girlfriend’s neck. I  purposely left two hickies, wanting everyone to know that I had laid  my claim on her. Of course it would probably embarrass her but deep  down I knew that the soreness of them would be welcomed as a reminder  of our intimate moment we were currently sharing together. The  thoughts made me open my mouth and bite her shoulder softly, getting  a small yelp. Quickly I let go with my teeth and licked the mark  soothingly. Fate’s hand on my neck pushed down a little more as she  opened her mouth to whisper out to me “Do that again…”

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By: Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha blushed as she realized what she had just done. The bite  mark was barely visible, more of a light red ring than actually  showing teeth marks. Despite it, however, Fate obviously liked the  motion. The blond squirmed lightly in her lap, head tilted way to the  side to offer more of her neck to the girl. Already Nanoha’s breath  was getting a little quicker, trying to get in a little more air  before another fit of kisses. When she was ready again she leaned  over once more, this time nudging Fate’s head upwards and kissed  down her collarbone awkwardly from the position. She waited until she  heard Fate take in a breath of air before once again opening her  mouth and biting down on her neck, much like a vampire would. This  time she received a moan that was clearly sensual instead of a  startled cry. Encouraged by this, Nanoha sucked a little harder than  before on the spot. Fate’s hand on her neck pressed harder on her  and body squirmed restlessly. Not letting up, she nipped at Fate’s  skin twice before finally pulling back to ease the mark by gently  licking it a few times.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blonde took a slow intake of air and reached down to her  stomach with her free arm to take Nanoha’s hand. Ever so slowly she  guided it upwards to her chest, where she placed her palm on the back  of her girlfriend’s hand and encouraged it to squeeze by closing  it. The motion worked and soon she felt the light fabric of her tank  top rubbing up against her as she was massaged. The stimulation was  exciting and new, making her eyes close against her will and lay back  against her girlfriend. A moment later she found Nanoha’s other  hand reach around her and grip her other breast, starting to rub them  both at the same time and sending her into a small wiggle fit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The movement made Nanoha giggle to herself. “Can’t keep  still?” She teased lovingly into Fate’s ear, making her blush  darkly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t say that…” She replied softly. “I can’t help  it; I’ve never been touched before…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It feels wonderful doesn’t it?” Nanoha nuzzled their cheeks  together. “Ever since you did it to me I’ve wanted to try it as  well…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate didn’t answer; instead moving her head a little and kissing  the brown haired girl’s cheek a few times to make her turn to face  her. When she did, Fate locked their lips in a solid kiss. “Mmmnnn…”  The blond purred deep in the back of her throat when the hands on her  tank top started rubbing again, this time slowly inching it upwards.  Only a few moments passed by before the shirt had made its way above  her breast and Nanoha touching her skin directly. “Ahhn….”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha smiled a little embarrassedly. She had never taken Fate for  a moaner before, but was pleasantly surprised to hear the cute little  sounds. Her lips found Fate’s ear and started to gently suck on the  lobe, lightly flecking her tongue on it before trailing it along the  outer edge of the ear itself. As she thought, Fate squirmed some more  and moved her head over again to find her lips. The girl with blue  eyes looked at her fondly, resting their foreheads together. The two  gazed at each other a moment longer before Fate closed her eyes and  parted her lips a little bit for her. Nanoha didn’t disappoint, and  placed her mouth on top of her girlfriend’s quickly, tongue sliding  past her lips almost instantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With a happy but startled sound, Fate responded to the deep kiss.  Her tongue gently rolled over her lover’s, sucking on it just  slightly when she could. Moments passed by them quickly, each lost in  the passion they shared. The red eyed girl slowly pulled away from  her lover, blushing darkly as she felt a mixture of their saliva  slide down her neck. Nanoha’s mouth was as wet as hers felt, their  kissing gotten way out of hand. Despite this she felt rather pleased  at the feeling, knowing that Nanoha’s wet mouth was because of <em>her</em>.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate let out a small startled cry when she felt herself suddenly  shifted. She had just a moment to wrap her arms around her  girlfriend’s neck to steady herself as she was lifted into the air.  Blinking, Fate looked around and realized that she was being carried  like a princess over to the stairs leading up to their bedroom. “Oh…  oh wow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I always imagined you carrying me, but we’ll let that go this  time,” Nanoha teased happily as she gently laid the blushing girl  on the bed and crawling on top of her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s okay,” Fate quickly rolled them over so she was on  top. “I’ll make up for it…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan’s aggressive today?” Nanoha lifted up lightly and  pulled her hair out from underneath her to keep it from pulling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,” She apologized, shifting her body so she was on top  of her friend fully, legs propped up on either side of her and face  hovering about a foot from the blue eyes of the girl beneath her.  Fate sat on Nanoha’s stomach lightly, keeping herself more propped  on her knees than actually putting weight on her. The two looked at  each other a moment before Nanoha finally realized what her friend  was thinking about and the realization lead to her cheeks suddenly  turning a darker shade as she became aware that she was <em>wanting</em> her to think it. Fate gently bent over and touched their noses  together. “Kiss me?” She gave Nanoha the best puppy dog look she  could muster and received a small nod for it. Ever so slowly they  brought their lips together once again, savoring the gentleness of it  after their frantic spell earlier.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha was a good kisser, Fate had decided. She knew just how to  touch their lips and still managed to breathe steadily throughout it.  The blond on the other hand was still a little clumsy, often kissing  Nanoha’s cheek just because she closed her eyes before leaning in  and making her kiss go astray. When the kiss ended she pulled back up  just a little bit, running her tongue over her lips to taste the  sweet honey flavored chapstick that Nanoha always wore. “Thank  you,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t have to thank me, silly,” She protested, pouting.  “I kiss you because I want to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Fate pondered, leaning back down towards her. The hands  holding hers tightened slightly as the brown haired girl leaned up  towards the kiss. Their lips met again, this time followed buy a  distinct purr deep in Nanoha’s throat. She knew the sound drove her  friend crazy and was reminded of this when Fate’s body weight was  pushed on her a little more as their bodies finally touched fully.  The kiss faded seamlessly into another, still soft and slow. Fate let  out another moan when Nanoha lifted her leg upwards, running it  between her thighs. She left her leg bent at the knee, placing her  foot flat on the bed and soon found Fate sliding backwards so her  panties ran up along the leg before moving forward again, slowly  dragging herself along her skin. “Light’s off,” she muttered,  making the computer recognize the keywords and shut off the lights in  the room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw,”  Nanoha protested lightly. “But Fate’s so pretty to  look at,” The words made her partner falter in her ministrations and  she knew that the girl was probably blushing. “Don’t be shy,”  She encouraged although she herself was still meek when it came to  showing her emotions physically. The words worked and Fate blindly  nuzzled Nanoha’s cheek, searching for the lips and recapturing them  in a gentle kiss when they were found. The hands holding hers  retreated after a gentle squeeze and trailed down her arms to come to  rest on her shoulders where they massaged them lightly. Nanoha in  turn moved her own hands up and around Fate’s back, pulling up her  tank top enough to slide her hands under the fabric.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate paused her kissing for a moment, instantly starting to nuzzle  her friend while her back was being rubbed. Although only Nanoha and  Arf knew it, Fate was somehow wired to cuddle against anything that  rubbed her back or stroked her hair. This fact made her extremely  delicate and protective of both parts of her body, only letting her  girlfriend and familiar touch her there. Nanoha had taken advantage  of this particular quirk in her friend and often used it whenever she  wanted to take a nap in the middle of the day and needed something to  resemble a teddy bear for her. Right now, however, the cuddling came  pared with slight rocking of the hips against her leg. From the  constant strokes, Nanoha began to realize that the motion was  starting to turn Fate on more than she already was, and in turn was  starting to affect her as well. Acting on impulse, Nanoha gently  started working her hands up Fate’s back to the point where a well  timed pull during a snuggle made the shirt pop over her head. The  blond paused a moment, giving Nanoha enough time to encourage it the  rest of the way off, making her hands retreat for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha is aggressive tonight?” She asked huskily, moving back  down to kiss her without even waiting for an answer. The kiss grew  deeper at her insistence and soon had the girl beneath her giving  soft moans of encouragement as their tongues touched each other’s.  Fate felt Nanoha’s hands once again on her back, rubbing it a  moment before reaching up scoop her hair up in a ponytail before  flinging it off to the side so she could touch skin without any  interruption.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmnn,” Nanoha agreed, slowly moving her hands from Fate’s  back to her front and gently cupping the skin there. Although a  simple motion, the happiness that Fate radiated by it was clearly  evident in the kiss they were currently sharing. Leaning forward  slightly, Fate pressed her chest against her friend’s hands and  closed her eyes when she felt them start rubbing “You’re so  sensitive,” She flirted, blushing at the sudden increase of  pressure against her leg where Fate was rubbing herself. Already she  felt her leg getting a little damp from the motions and knew that the  blond was starting to really get into what they were doing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That feels wonderful,” The girl simply said in return,  putting both hands on either side of Nanoha and propping herself up  so the girl beneath her could do whatever she wanted. At first she  didn’t expect anything more than a simple massage, but found all  too soon a new sensation that made her cry out. Nanoha’s mouth  enveloped Fate’s right nipple and sucked softly, unsure of how to  do it herself. However bad she thought she was, the red eyed girl  seemed to enjoy it immensely. A minute passed before Fate couldn’t  keep herself contained any longer and started to pant openly and  whimper when Nanoha’s tongue finally flicked against her nipple as  well. The motion was later repeated on her left breast as well,  making Fate wrap her hands behind her friend’s neck and hold it  closer to herself in a silent request to suck harder. The movement  worked and Fate closed her eyes, whimpering out Nanoha’s name every  few moments.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl on bottom finally pulled away from her breast and laid  back down, trying to get some air back in her lungs again. Looking up  at the squirming girl, she realized that she had a strange sense of  satisfaction at seeing the several small bruises she had just put  across Fate’s chest. “Come here,” She whispered out softly,  finding Fate’s hands and gently urging her to slide forward.  Although reluctant to remove herself from Nanoha’s raised leg, Fate  still crawled forward at Nanoha’s beckoning, shivering lightly when  her friend slid herself under her body.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blond was left to wonder what she was going to do for a few  moments before she felt a trail of kisses start to touch her thighs.  Fate’s world stopped briefly when she felt her wet panties be  nuzzled by her friend’s nose a moment before being slipped to the  side. Before she could even fully recognize what was about to happen  she felt Nanoha’s tongue briefly glaze her lower lips. “Na-Nanoha!”  She gasped, feeling the soft tongue go again, this time a little  slower. “Do-don’t…that’s dirty…” Fate blushed horribly  when her friend didn’t stop. Instead she felt her press upwards to  her, tongue now fully starting to lick her. “Nanoha…” Fate fell  forward, catching herself with outstretched hands to hold her body  up. It was the first time she had ever been touched there before and  the fact that it was her <em>tongue</em> doing the touching left Fate  torn between extreme embarrassment and a sudden new desire that she  had never allowed herself to dwell on before. Moments slowly ticked  past, each one making Fate shiver more at the antagonizing slow  licking she was receiving. Finally she couldn’t stop herself  anymore and leaned back, now properly sitting on her friend’s face,  keeping herself just in the right height be sinking to her knees.  Nanoha replied in kind by reaching her hands up and gently cupping  Fate’s breast before leaning up and sticking her tongue inside her  for the first time. The sexual cry was loud but she didn’t care,  the feeling was too good to hold back anymore.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One of Nanoha’s hands slowly retreated after a while and Fate  watched it slide under her body and reach down to lay to rest on the  girl beneath her’s panties where it slowly started to rub in a  small circle. Realizing that she was the only one to be getting  pleased properly, Fate blushed at her own selfishness and gently took  the hand that was fondling her and kissed the fingers a moment before  lifting herself up and away from her. Nanoha looked up at the girl  when she moved, and received a small kiss on the forehead before Fate  turned over and laid across her body so her face was now in-between  her legs as well. The brown haired girl picked up almost promptly,  tongue finding the new position a little easier to lick the full  length of Fate’s slit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Now with her lover’s panties in front of her face, Fate slowly  moved her hands to the sides of Nanoha’s legs and instead of simply  pulling them to the side like she had done, the blond wiggled them  down, sliding the fabric all the way to her knees, where Nanoha moved  one leg to slip out of them and allowed the cloth to stay around her  other ankle. The sight made Fate even more turned on but she tore  herself from it to look at Nanoha once again. Although the room  wasn’t illuminated much the light from the windows gave her more  than enough light to see the small hair patch and slit beneath her.  Fate took a moment to look before starting. She had seen Nanoha naked  countless times now, but had never once allowed her eyes to trail so  far down to enjoy the sight she now had. Slowly she leaned forward  and planted a small kiss at the top. The licking she was receiving  slowed dramatically and stopped all together when she tentatively ran  the tip of her tongue along the wet slit below her. Nanoha moaned  softly at the motion and got progressively louder as her tongue  pressed down farther, finally finding her hole and dipping itself  inside.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The licking picked up again all at once, mimicking what Fate was  doing to her. The quiet room was filled with soft moans and wet  sounds that made each girl blush horribly but still secretly turn  them on more. The time passed was lost on them, but each knew that  they were starting to get closer to the finish. Nanoha was the first  to buck her hips, making Fate gasp in surprise. She felt her lover’s  hands grip around her waist and the breath against her mound starting  to get erratic. Once she realized what was happening, Fate put her  head back down, licking and twirling her tongue quickly over and  inside her. The motion worked and Nanoha gave up pleasing Fate all  together and instead let her head fall back on the bed and cry out.  “So close, Fate!” She managed to get a logical sentence out  between the panting, pushing her hips up towards her friend in a  frantic pace that she couldn’t control anymore. Fate had to wrap  both arms around the girl and hold her still to continue, now finally  moving her mouth to her clit and nuzzled around it a moment before  able to gently suckle. Nanoha’s reaction was a little more than  Fate expected, but still made her happy that she could do something  that would make her squirm and pant like she had been doing. Fate’s  mind flashed back to when she would nibble on her friend’s earlobe  and decided that might be a good thing to try out right now and  proceeded to gently allow her lips to cover her teeth before sucking  and nibbling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha screamed out, frantically trying to rock her hips but was  still held tight by the girl on top. “Fate!” the words escaped  her mouth without her even realizing it. “S-stop, it’s too…too  sensitive!” Her pleas had the opposite reaction she had been hoping  for and found her lover only going at it harder now. It was too much  and Nanoha threw her head back into the bed and simply let out her  first sexual scream ever.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate’s eyes widened at the sound and felt Nanoha spasm under  her. Before she could do anything else, a small splash of something  warm and wet covered her face. It was followed immediately by a more  sever orgasm that rocked Nanoha’s body hard since Fate didn’t  stop trying to please her even during it. Pressing her tongue back  inside, Fate felt the muscles clamping around her as she gave her  friend another orgasm immediately after the first one died down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Blue eyes started blankly up at the ceiling as she panted heavily.  She felt Fate’s tongue still gently licking her, making her hips  shake every time the wet tongue would start again. Slowly she  regained her senses and lifted her head back up to return the favor.  After a few moments of exploring, she found the spot that made Fate  shiver the most and proceeded to flick her tongue over it quickly.  All at once the blond on top started to wiggle in passion, getting  held still by Nanoha’s arms as they wrapped around her. “Stay  still, wiggle worm.” She teased lovingly, feeling Fate nod. Now  with her friend containing herself, she started again. This time her  hands went in front of her face and gently pressed against her before  moving away to spread out her lover’s lower lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Na…Nanoha…” Fate closed her eyes tightly. “Don’t look  at me like that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But Fate’s pretty,” She protested while slowly moving her  tongue along the now exposed parts of her. Fate took a loud intake of  air before letting it out as a low purr as Nanoha’s fingers moved  along her folds and spread her out more. “Even here if pretty,”  She mused lovingly, pushing her tongue far inside the girl and  getting an almost immediate orgasm. Pleased at this, Nanoha stuck out  her tongue as far as she could and proceeded to push it in and out of  the hole in front of her. No longer than thirty seconds passed before  the muscles spasmed around her and the girl came. Unlike Nanoha, Fate  chose rather to let out a loud gasp followed by an erratic moan of  pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate calmed down slowly, gently moving her hips along her friend’s  face against her will. When her body would finally listen to her  again she shakily moved back around and fell half beside, half on top  of her lover. “That was wonderful,” She whispered, feeling  herself get embraced and back rubbed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Nanoha agreed quietly, running her hand along Fate’s  body before trailing over her butt and gently squeezing it. The  motion made the red eyes turn to lock into her own and before long  they were leaning up close to each other for a kiss. “You mind…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not if you don’t?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly the girls looked at each other’s wet faces before  tenderly engaging in a kiss. The contact was slow, both girls too shy  from their previous actions. With the encouragement of Nanoha’s  hands, Fate found herself starting to care less about the awkward  taste and started to lick her friend’s face, cutting her off with a  deep kiss before she could say anything in return.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The brown haired girl broke the kiss shortly, rolling them over  and licking her face instead. Her legs straddled her friends and she  pulled back just enough to take off her own shirt with a little bit  of help. She allowed Fate a moment to gaze at her body before she  slowly slid backwards and looped her fingers around her friend’s  panties and sliding them down her slender legs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Again?” Fate whispered, getting an embarrassed nod. Their  hands reached out towards each other and interlaced their fingers  once they touched. Slowly Fate lifted one leg and slid it around  Nanoha’s waist, letting her other go below her lover’s other leg.  Nanoha nodded at her in understanding and shifted herself to slide  forward, bending one leg at the knee around Fate’s back and  allowing her other to slip below the thigh.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Each started slowly, gently moving their hips awkwardly to rub  their mounds together. Time passed slowly while they rocked, starting  to speed up a little once they figured out a rhythm. Hands let go of  the other and instead went to brace themselves, lifting up their  waist to more frantically grind against each other. Their breathing  picked up again, each one panting the other’s name while trying to  hold themselves up and breathe.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha caught her friend’s eye, gasping for air with her mouth  open. She gave her a small moan, pushing more against her. Fate in  turn blushed and pushed back, now roughly sliding across each other  using their wet skin as lubrication. Leaning forward, the girls  embraced each other as best they could, kissing sloppily and pressing  together more. Hands slid over each other’s backs, smearing the  beads of sweat around their bodies before going back to their breast.  “I’m getting… close again…” The blue eyed girl whispered  huskily. “Come with me, Fate?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” Fate kissed her hard, slipping her tongue into her  mouth and licking the roof of it lovingly. Each took one of their  hands down lower, pressing against their lover’s body just where  they were grinding together and started to quickly rub while they  moved. The kiss they shared started to break against their will when  more air was needed to continue. “Nanoha…Nanohaaa!” Fate closed  her eyes allowing herself to get rougher with her lover.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha let out a loud scream of pleasure as she came roughly,  feeling Fate do the same. The girls pressed against each other as  hard as they could until the waves died down and allowing them to  collapse on the bed weakly. Moments ticked by them as they each tried  to calm themselves down, too weak to move. Finally Nanoha made the  effort, gently pulling her sore body away from Fate’s and blushing  horribly at how sticky her thighs felt. Ever so slowly she crawled  over to her red eyed friend and kissed her gently. “Shower?” She  felt her body was more wet than dry anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah…” Fate sat up with her help and the two made their way  to the bathroom holding hands. The water cut on instantly at the  press of a button, getting several sprays of water on them. At first  Fate went to get her hair wet but found Nanoha’s hand around her  waist and the other wrapping around her chest, fondling her.  “Wha-what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who said I wanted to get clean?” She whispered softly, once  again trailing a line of kisses along her wet shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmmnnn…” She didn’t protest, rather she leaned back  against the body and allowed herself to be felt. “You’re so  bold…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,” She apologized gently, hugging her. “But I’ve  dreamed for so long… I want to make it last…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me too…Me too…” Fate took the hand around her waist and  shyly moved it down lower. “Let’s make it last…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah…” Nanoha kissed her shoulder before trailing a line  down her back. The hand around front rubbed Fate’s stomach lovingly  before moving farther down and finding the gentle folds that she was  after. Ever so slowly she ran her fingers along the soft area,  feeling the sticky fluids of their previous love making being washed  away from the warm water flowing all around them. “Is it okay if  I…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” Fate looked back over her shoulder and was rewarded  with a loving kiss. “Be gentle?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course…” Nanoha kissed her once again before using one  hand to embrace her and letting the other slowly rub the girl. Ever  so slowly she moved her fingers between Fate’s lips, rubbing the  length of her slit a few times before stopping at the entrance and  lightly dipping the tip of her finger inside of her. Fate’s  breathing stopped momentarily as the finger pushed in deeper before  pulling back out again. The simple motion was slowly repeated once  more, this time with a little more confidence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate closed her eyes and exhaled, feeling her body heating up more  from the passion and the hot water showering her. Shyly one hand  reached to her stomach where it embraced Nanoha’s. After a loving  pat to it she gripped her lover’s hand gently, moving the smaller  two fingers down and pressed her thumb against the palm as well.  After holding her hand like that a few seconds Fate moved her hand to  the two fingers that weren’t closed and enveloped them, moving her  hand in a shy suggestive way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The brown haired girl nodded against Fate’s shoulder at the  silent request. Her hand allowed another finger to trace along the  blonde’s folds before it too was slowly inserted. Almost at once  Fate let out a moan and once the fingers were being moved in and out  at a slow stead pace, she started to rock her hips backwards along  Nanoha’s front. “Does it feel good?” She whispered softly,  planting a line of kisses along Fate’s shoulder blade.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes…” She closed her eyes and they both sank to the floor.  Nanoha sat on her knees with her lover in-between them, her legs  spread out more. “I love you, Nanoha…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love you, too.” She kissed her hair softly before reaching  down and gently twisting one of Fate’s nipples. The motion made the  girl start to squirm again, pushing her hips up in a rhythm that  matched Nanoha’s insertions. Time passed was lost, each moment  making the blond start to move just a little quicker, silently  requesting just a little more from her lover.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate started to pant more, eyes closing as her legs started to get  weak. “I’m…getting close again…” Her head leaned back  against Nanoha’s chest, allowing one hand to brace herself up as  best she could and using the other to grip her lover’s hand. Her  pants turned to light moans, evolving quickly into short gasp and  finally moans mixed with soft screams. She looked up at Nanoha  lovingly, risking her balance to reach up and awkwardly place her  palm against her cheek.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha smiled fondly down at her, increasing her speed to please  her more. The motions worked as she had hoped and she received the  vision of Fate opening her mouth in a loud scream of pleasure. Their  eyes met and Fate allowed herself to not hold back her cries of  passion since Nanoha seemed to enjoy them. The waves of pleasure  subsided slowly and Fate slid down to lay on the shower floor, glad  that the area for bathing was so large. Nanoha moved to sit next to  her, slowly running a hand over her stomach and up to her breast  before back down again. The two stayed like that for a short while,  Fate resting contently as Nanoha simply enjoyed the sight of her  lover’s body.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally the blond smiled, moving her hand up to block the constant  rain of water. “Your turn,” She spoke happily. Slowly sitting up,  she moved towards her friend and helped her lay down instead. Nanoha  gave her an embarrassed look before having to close her eyes when the  water’s spray came down on her fully. Fate moved over so she was  kneeling next to the laying girl and shyly encouraged her to part her  legs a little. The motion was complied with and Fate paused just a  moment to fully appreciate what she was blessed with as a lover. Ever  so slowly she leaned over and kissed her friend on the lips, hand  slowly trailing down the wet shivering body. “Soft?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha felt her cheeks color darkly. “...At first?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,” She kissed her one more time before resting their  foreheads together. Using two fingers, she parted Nanoha’s sex  before inserting her middle finger gently. The motion made the girl  sigh happily and reach up blindly to embrace her friend. The water  rolled over them as the simple motion of moving was repeated slowly.  Fate smiled down at Nanoha and kissed her a few times before pulling  her finger out and pressing two back against her. With a small nod as  confirmation she wiggled them inside, pleased at the tight feeling  around them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate…” Nanoha moaned the name more than spoke it as she  gently raised her hips, finding a pattern to match. The fingers being  pressed inside her started to speed up a little at a time with the  encouragement of her quickening rocks. Shortly Nanoha gave up trying  to suppress her urges and pulled Fate close to her. “Tr…try…”  She closed her eyes tightly, too shy to say it out loud. Her hand on  Fate’s back closed partially, pressing three fingers against her  skin and moving it in a forward and back motion.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate kissed her friend soothingly. “Okay,” She whispered to  her in a calming manor. “Don’t be shy,” She pressed their lips  together again while adding a third finger. Their pace was lost  almost immediately. Nanoha screamed out in the kiss, pausing her  rocking but encouraging Fate to continue by holding her closer. The  fingers made their way slowly inside of her before being lightly  spread apart as they were removed. The blue eyed girl couldn’t hide  the feeling of ecstasy, light tears coming from her eyes before being  lost to the shower of water.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ngghhh… Oh Fate….” She moaned loudly as the movement  continued, slowly increasing in speed as the girl adjusted to the new  width. “Ahhnnn…. Ahn!” She closed her eyes tighter when Fate  picked up the speed all at once. Minutes ticked by but the motion  didn’t let up, only increasing in pressure and speed. Finally  Nanoha opened her eyes and chocked on a gasp. A light coughing spell  rocked her body, causing Fate to quit all at once. “Don’t stop!”  She pleaded desperately. “I’m fine!” She took a long intake of  air to prove the point and let it out as a scream when the fingers  were shoved into her again. Her hips lifted up shakily, breath  leaving her in hard gasps and moans. When Fate reached over to  embrace her breast she lost it all at once.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The scream was loud, not caring about anything but the pleasure of  release that she was receiving. It was followed by a second less  intense scream then by a third loud moan. Fate calmed her  ministrations and smiled to herself. Her lover was reduced to a state  where she could only shiver in pleasure, her body twitching at the  slightest touch. Looking to please her more, Fate leaned over and  enveloped one of her friend’s nipples with her mouth. Her tongue  moved over it lovingly as she suckled on it. The girl laying down  purred our appreciatively and more than happily allowed Fate to  continue the motions until the water started to become too cold to  bear anymore.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m cold,” Nanoha finally whispered out, getting a nod in  return. The water was cut off and the two girls slowly got to their  feet with shaking legs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We didn’t even clean up any,” Fate informed her as she  placed a towel around Nanoha’s hair and began to soak up the water  held within.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Its okay,” She replied softly, enjoying the motion. “I  don’t want to clean away where Fate’s touched me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Blushing, she embraced the girl. “In that case, who needs a  towel?” She dropped the clothing and lifted up the still wet girl  into her arms. “My turn,” She kissed her nose and carried the  girl out the door and into the bedroom.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate…” She looked up at her eyes passionately as she was  laid down and climbed on. She found Fate’s knee between her legs so  she raised hers back up to mimic what she did earlier. As she  suspected, Fate instantly slid her lower lips across the already wet  leg and purred out in pleasure. “I don’t know if I can go again…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate leaned over and kissed her, rocking her hips at a medium  pace. It didn’t take more than half a minute before Nanoha copied  her, putting her tip toes onto the bed and raising her hips to rub  against her leg as well. Their tongues danced around each other’s  quickly, bodies rubbing against the other. Their shyness being mostly  gone now, the girls rolled over each other, panting their names and  moaning without restraint. Time and time again their hands explored  each other’s bodies, fingers pressing into each other’s love and  mouths nipping every inch of skin they could kiss.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate came first, letting out a frantic cry of pleasure while  Nanoha sank her teeth into the woman once more. Not stopping to let  her rest, she increased the speed if her fingers inside her girl and  sucked as hard as she could on the wound she had inflicted with her  teeth. Fate felt her eyes roll back in her head, body spasming longer  than she could remember. The pain in her neck came again as Nanoha  continued to suck and brace her teeth against her soft skin. Despite  knowing she would regret it later, Fate pressed her hand against  Nanoha’s neck to encourage it. In return she felt the fingers  inside of her get harsher and the sucking increase. Another more  powerful orgasm shook her body, making her tighten around her friend  and moan out more, too tired to scream. When her body finally tired  down she allowed herself to fall. “No more…” She gasped out for  air. “No more…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;More...&quot; Nanoha whispered huskily as she crawled up her  body and began kissing the girl again. &quot;...More.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate caved in almost instantly, wrapping her arms around the girl  and moving a leg around her waist. Wet kisses danced on their lips as  their hands once again began to explore. She started with three  fingers this time, pushing them into her lover after allowing her  time to prepare for it. The girl was already obviously close,  whispering her love for Fate over and over again as she moved her  body back against the hand. Her words steadily grew louder, signaling  her countless climax of the night.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate looked at her lover and smiled. Her body was covered in sweat  and water, hair sprawled out messily behind her. The air around them  lingered of sex and sweat, bed sheets torn from the mattress. Small  bruises littered Nanoha’s chest, evidence of the actions she had  just done that night. The girl was moving frantically, panting and  gasping out her name while tangling her hair up even more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She had never looked more beautiful than right now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The end came next, a cry of satisfaction and love. A declaration  that she belonged to the girl with the deep red eyes. Nanoha’s body  gave a final shake before collapsing onto her lover. Each panted  harshly, sucking in air as best they could. Weakly their arms sought  out for each other and embraced as best they could. “I… love  you…” Nanoha managed out, coughing a little but kissing her  lover’s cheek after it to show she was okay.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love you too...” Fate replied softly, voice almost gone  from the cries of pleasure that night. “I love you so much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll never get tired of hearing that…” She cuddled  against her closely. “Hold me all night?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Every night.” Fate kissed the top of her head. “You don’t  even need to ask, Sweetheart.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you…Sweet dreams, Darling.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You too. Sweet dreams.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two closed their eyes and sighed contently. The silence washed  over their weak bodies, cool air calming their hot skin. Both the  girls felt their activates washing over them, pushing them closer and  closer to blissful dreams. Shifting lightly, they got more  comfortable and whispered a final message of love before allowing  themselves to finally succumb to the weariness of their bodies.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sir, it is 5:30 AM, please wake and prepare for the day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“5:30 alarm set, please wake up my master.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha opened her eyes. “…Please tell me they just didn’t  tell us to wake up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate groaned, looking over the brown hair of her girlfriend and  out into the raising sun outside the window. “…They did.”</span></p>
