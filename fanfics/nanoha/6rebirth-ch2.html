“Hey everyone,” I  greeted the floating monitor display in front of me that was  currently doubling as a recording device. “I hope you’re all  doing well.” My lips turned up to a smile as my gaze looked through  the yellowish square and to the picture of my family. “I’m sorry  I haven’t been able to get in contact with everyone for a while...”  I giggled. “A long while… But please forgive me, I’ve been  really busy. As you can see, I’m not on the Asura anymore.” I  lead the display around with me as I walked to the railing that went  around my bedroom and looked over onto the other part of my loft. “I  have a steady home now; it’s on base but it is actually mine. When  I retire this apartment will still be here for me, Hayate-chan made  sure of it. Oh! Fate-chan lives with me too.” Turning back to the  display, I gave a peace sign. “We’re still dating, this makes  almost six years now. Sometimes I wish we would take the final step  but it’s been so busy I haven’t even had time to bring it up with  her yet…” I waved my hand to brush it off. “But that’s not  what this is about. You’ll be proud of me; I’m officially in  charge of training here at the sixth mobile division. I have four  people right now under me and even though we’ve only been here for  two weeks, I’m confident that they will do just fine whenever we  dispatch.” My head turned to the sound of my door opening and saw  Fate walk in. “Fate-chan, come say hi to my family!”
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>TSAB:  6</strong><strong>th</strong><strong> mobile division II</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By:  Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Video letter?”  Fate pondered as she walked up the stairs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah!” Nanoha  turned the screen to focus onto the blond. “Fate-chan is in charge  of actual missions, though she seems to be bogged down with paperwork  lately,” She narrated as her friend got closer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello everyone,”  Fate bowed to the camera. “Have you told them yet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just about to,”  Nanoha hopped around to stand beside Fate. “I will be able to come  visit around Christmas time! I know it’s a long way away, but I  already put in for leave.” The girl blushed lightly. “I asked  Fate-chan to come too and she said she would, so I’m looking  forward to being with all my family. “</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can’t wait,”  Fate added in with a smile and a wave.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, I’ll see you  then… I love you guys.” Her blue eyes started to tear up a  little. “I miss you.” She gave a small wave and cut off the  recording device before she had to sniff and wipe her eyes. “Hard  to believe I haven’t seen them in almost two years now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ever since Chrono  became an Admiral and couldn’t use his ship as a middle point for  teleportation,” Fate agreed, sitting on the bed. “I remember him  and Amy having to go through the teleporting logs and erase it so no  one would know you were skirting your duties to see your family back  on Earth.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Haha, you make it  sound like it was a <em>bad</em> thing!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If we were caught  we’d all be demoted!” Fate grinned despite the seriousness of her  words. “Wow, we broke a lot of rules back then didn’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nyahaha, makes me  wonder what our students are doing right now while we’re not  watching over them.” Nanoha smiled at her and crawled on the bed  behind her, starting to rub her shoulders. “You’re tense…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t even start.”  Fate turned and grabbed the hands. “I don’t have time today.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Spoilsport,”  Nanoha pouted. “I have almost two hours to kill.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I only have half an  hour.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you plans?”  The girl fell back onto their large bed and stared up at the ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Going to lunch with  Hayate-chan before dropping her off at the church, then heading over  to check up on some Intel while I’m over at the main base. There’s  supposed to be some new model of gadget and I want to get the  information as soon as I can.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bring me back a  folder please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course,” Fate  turned to look at her. “You’re panty-shotting again.” Her words  got a half hearted attempt to fix the mini skirt. “Still,” She  teased.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Meh, you’ve seen  them anyway.” Nanoha gave up and sprawled out in an X shape.  Several second ticked by before she found Fate crawling on top of  her. “Oh no,” She crossed her arms. “If you don’t have enough  time to nap then you don’t have enough time to….hey…stop that…  s-stop…Ah…. Fate-chan we can’t….we –nng-… don’t have  time…to do…this… ahnn…okay-five-minutes!” She grabbed her  neck and pulled her down.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“You’re late,”  Hayate accused when the blond woman finally got into her car that was  waiting outside the residential area. “Honestly Fate-chan, if it  was anyone else…”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then I’d be more  worried about my status than feeling bad I made them wait,” Fate  finished for her as she sat down and buckled up. “Sorry,  Hayate-chan. Nanoha wouldn’t let me leave.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s all right,”  Hayate glanced at her mirror before driving off. “Did she try to  put you to sleep again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Attempted to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate looked over at  the slightly red girl and noticed that she had obviously been  sweating recently. “You’re not sick are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh? Um, no.” Fate  tried to finger comb her hair, even going as far as to flip down the  sun visor to look at the mirror on the back of it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Oh!” Hayate  blushed. “Mou, no wonder you’re late.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We didn’t do  anything bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t need to  know my two best friend’s love lives,” She complained. “So  please don’t do anything to even hint at it, especially when I’m  waiting on you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We didn’t I  promise!” Fate reached over to touch her shoulder but the girl  moved away playfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know where  those fingers have been,” She stuck out her tongue.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate instantly felt her  cheeks color and ears burn. “We just kissed, stop teasing me!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha scratched her  cheek lightly as she stepped over a dazed Subaru. “Did I go a  little overboard?” she pondered aloud while scanning the area. Tia  was laid on the ground as well, panting heavily. Caro fell to her  hands and knees, trying to suck in a little more air. “Where’s  Elio?” her vision caught Caro’s lips, turned upwards lightly in a  smile. “Uh oh,”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The concrete under  Nanoha exploded into shrapnel instantly, forcing the girl to take to  the air. “No you don’t!” Subaru yelled out as her wing road  flashed above the instructor, cutting off her escape path.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not here either!”  Tia shot several blast to the side, making sure Nanoha couldn’t  veer that way either. Both of the girl’s false images on the ground  vanished now that they were no longer needed as a distraction.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Looking down, Nanoha  saw Elio shooting upwards at her, spear extended. The ruble from his  exit was still flying thick, cutting off her vision with the dust.  ‘<em>Only one way out,</em>’ she mused, instantly flying directly  backwards. The back of her neck itched slightly, making the battle  veteran smile to herself. Caro had apparently put a delayed binding  spell there. ‘<em>I could twirl my way through it,</em>’ she  thought quickly, seeing Elio break through the dust and prepare to  strike her. ‘<em>But with this kind of teamwork, I think letting  them win would be a more of a moral boost to encourage this in the  future…holes can be worked on later.</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio let out a war cry,  thrusting forward with everything he had. His spear clashed violently  against Nanoha’s shield, flaring out a magical ripple around them.  “Break through!” his words were screamed out, arm struggling to  keep up the momentum. A pink flare of energy ripped into him, cursing  through his veins and out into his weapon. The tip exploded in light  and shattered Nanoha’s barrier, allowing it to cleanly sink into  her barrier jacket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha turned her body  quickly to avoid any damage to her shoulder, also allowing the child  to soar past her since he couldn’t stop the momentum of the attack.  The group went still as the dust settled, each holding their breath  to see if the mission was a success or not. “Mission finished,”  Raising Heart declared as Nanoha landed. Looking over her shoulder,  she smiled lightly to herself at the sight of Elio caught in the  binding spell Caro had put it. “Status: Complete.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Congratulations,”  Nanoha informed them, pointing to the ripped cloth of her jacket.  “Mission complete, you cut through my defenses.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh thank god,”  Subaru fell to the ground and panted out. “I can’t move…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whoa…” Tia  rubbed her shoulders ruefully. “Talk about intense… Great job,  Caro.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was nothing…”  The pink haired girl’s arms were shaking lightly. Trying to push  herself up only made her fall, however, and she chose to lay there to  rest a moment. “Hehe, I can’t move.” She looked up at her  friends with a light smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here,” Elio  finally managed to get down from the floating chains and knelt down  in front of her, offering his back. “I’ll carry you to the base?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Thank you,” She  managed to get up enough to fall over onto him when she realized her  legs were too tired to support her as well. The red headed youth  grunted lightly under her minute weight but managed to stand up while  giving the piggy-back ride.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>All that with  their own devices,</em>’ Nanoha’s eyes went from Subaru’s  smoking roller blades to Tia’s sparking gun. Even though Elio’s  spear was put back into its unit form she got enough sight on it  during the attack to know it was cracking under all the stress it was  going under. ‘<em>Caro is also having a hard time since she can’t  use cartridges…I think it’s time for them to receive their  official weapons and armor.</em>’ Clapping her hands together, she  called everyone’s attention. “Okay people, for now let’s all go  to the 6th division’s HQ and get cleaned up. Once you’ve  had a shower we will meet in the lobby okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma’am!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Bardiche?” Fate  asked, looking at Shari on the display. “I suppose it’s time for  a tune up, why this all of a sudden?” The girl ate a bite of her  meal while waiting for a response.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha is going to  give the recruits their official devices today; I thought it would be  good if we tuned up yours and hers as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How long will it  take?” Fate looked down at her hand towards the yellow triangle gem  embedded on her glove. She had never liked going anywhere without her  life-long partner, even if it <em>was</em> getting a check up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well normally it  would only take a few hours, but since its you we’re talking about…  Two days maybe?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She sighed. “All  right, I can live with that. Don’t do anything he doesn’t want,  all right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shari gave her friend  an amused look. “Like I ever would.” Turning, the girl looked  behind herself. “I have to go, it looks like they’re all here  now. I need to explain how their devices work and such.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See you, Shari.”  Fate sighed when the screen disappeared, leaving her alone once again  to eat her meal. Hayate was at the cathedral doing her meeting and  she had already obtained all the information she could while at the  local Intel center so she was stuck with waiting for her friend to  give her a ride back home. ‘<em>Too bad Hayate had to go in early, I  hate eating alone…</em>’</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“…So they won’t  feel out of place, even if you’ve never used them before,” Nanoha  continued while walking with her troops back towards the training  area. Shari had just given them all a one over on how their new  devices worked but the teacher in Nanoha made her continue to rant as  they continued along their way.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is it,  Elio-kun?” The instructor paused to turn back and look at him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love our new  uniforms but…Strada doesn’t really look any different…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have you tried  asking him?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha knelt down in  front of him and put a hand on top of his head. “Strada is now  alive, Elio-kun. Even if his intelligence is artificial… He has a  heart. For now on you two will be working together, so be good  friends okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Gazing down at the  smooth metal in his hands, the boy took in a breath. “Strada… How  do you feel?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“100, sir.” It  replied briskly. “Are you in good condition?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-yes!” he looked  surprised that it would ask him. “So this is an intelligent  device…” His mouth turned up into a grin. “Let’s become great  partners, all right!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes sir!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With a light giggle the  woman stood up again. “So then, I have a special playground in mind  for you to get used your new devices,” Nanoha moved out her hands  to summon keyboards in the air. “The object of this training  exercise is to have fun and get the feel for what you can do. I don’t  mind what activities you choose to do inside the field, just don’t  go to sleep on me okay?” Her words got a few laughs, making her  smile as well. “Okay, here we-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!” Shari’s  voice broke in over hers as a display screen appeared right in front  of her followed by several flashing red screens that read Alert. “We  have a lock on a relic! Can you dispatch!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The woman turned to  look at her students. Several things went through her mind all at  once, but one thing locked into place when seeing the determined  expressions all glaring at her. “Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then bring everyone  to the central building!” The screens cut off, leaving them alone  once again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is it, your  first mission.” Nanoha spoke officially to them. “All of you are  up to this, correct?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma’am!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good,” She waved  out her hand. “Then sixth mobile unit, move out!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Seven trucks,”  Shari informed quickly. “They are all exporting legal supplies but  one of them has the readings of a Lost Logia. Your mission is to get  to that truck and retrieve it, preferably before gadget drones can  make the scene more difficult.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate nodded to herself,  forcing her car through traffic. A screen to her right showed Nanoha  with her students and another next to it showed Hayate in a car as  well. “Request permission for personal flight,” The blond spoke  out as she downshifted and puller her emergency brake, making her car  slide sideways. Halfway into the spin she counter-steered sharply and  hit the gas, smoking her tires. Her hand shoved the handle brake back  down and allowed her wheels to grip pavement again, slinging her  around the turn without losing any of her speed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Scary…” Nanoha  whispered, feeling herself sweat lightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Permission  requested,” Hayate acknowledged her as her hands typed around in  front of herself. “…granted for mage Fate.” She was glad the  church was giving her a ride back thanks to the emergency call.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can someone give me  a ride back here to reclaim my car once it’s over?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can,” Nanoha  replied easily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then I’m parking  and flying the rest,” She cut another power slide into a parking  lot and leapt out of her door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here I am, so  nervous I can’t breathe straight,” Subaru began, getting Tia to  look over at her. “And they talk about where they’re parking her  car…” The girl looked around the small holding area of the  helicopter they were currently in. There were no windows, making her  feel rather closed in. “Amazing how they’re used to this…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s how Aces  work huh?” Tia whispered back, swallowing. “Something as simple  as this is child’s play to them…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Us too,” Elio  joined in, gripping his watch with one hand. “We’re ready.” He  received two sharp nods and could tell the females suddenly felt more  secure about themselves. His gaze went back over to Caro next to him  and then go down to her lap, where she was nervously rubbing her  hands. “Hey, you okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh? Um, yes.” She  tried to smile at him. “Just nervous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be, I’ll  protect you so you can cast without any worries okay?” He reached  over and placed his hand on top of hers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio-kun…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Emergency reading!”  Shari called out, face appearing on the screen again. Several  monitors flared around them momentarily to warn them. “New gadget  type device spotted in the vicinity of the trucks, they’re airborne  models we’ve never encountered before!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-chan,  Fate-chan, can you handle those?” Hayate’s display came to the  foreground of the others floating in the air. “Vice-kun, can you  manage without their cover fire?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yet another display  appeared in the air, showing the brown headed pilot. “Don’t  underestimate me, Hayate-chan! I’ll fly circles around whatever  they let by!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We won’t let any  by,” Nanoha challenged.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ohh? If you do, even  one, drinks are on you tonight babe!” Vice grinned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s a bet!”  Nanoha smiled and held out Raising Heart. “But don’t get mad when  you’re treating me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro fidgeted in her  seat. “They’re so relaxed…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Its like a switch,”  Nanoha kneeled down in front of the pink haired girl. “One thing  that you will eventually have to learn to do as well.” Her hands  went to both of the younger soldier’s shoulders. “Listen you two…  This is a real battle now, so look after each other… I won’t lie,  it may get ugly down there, but you are both strong. Just remember…  what you do down there is for the sake of countless innocent people  you will be protecting from this dangerous substance. Be strong you  two, go all out, and when you’re done, let it go. Don’t reflect  on it, just let it go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio swallowed thickly.  “Yes ma’am.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay…” Caro  looked even more nervous.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro-san,” Nanoha  took both of her hands in her own. “You’re a sweet girl, and I  know you have a great passion to protect everyone around you… you  have a very special power that will allow you to do that, so embrace  it. Because of you and your lovely gentle power of protection, I’m  not worried about any of you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha stood and looked  over at the two older members. “And you two…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Make it fast,  Nanoha-chan!” Vice yelled out suddenly. “We’re about to  engage!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The teacher grinned.  “Kick booty out there, okay?” She gave them a thumbs up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma’am!” They  both saluted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha giggled lightly  before turning to look at the opening hatch. All at once her eyes  narrowed and her fist clenched. “Raising Heart…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes master?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Set up!” The girl  screamed as she leapt from the vehicle, wind flaring around her as  her cloths shattered into the sky. Her body was kissed by the clouds,  the soft mist clinging to her body. The sky blessed her with its  color, stringing through the white cloud residue. Finally the sun  loaned her its warmth, solidifying the elements to form her barrier  jacket. Raising Heart was already in its staff form, shooting out a  cartridge to instantly change into accel shooting mode. Her eyes lost  their shine, no longer kind and caring. Tight gloved hands gripped  the cool metal as magical energy ripped through her veins, cursing  with a power that her enemies would soon never forget. “Raising  Heart,” Even her voice was no longer gentle but now firm and set.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know, my master.”  The voice was soothing to its master, making the girl loosen up just  a little. “I will protect you. Sealing cartridge loaded in reserve  clip.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Thank you.”  Nanoha launched herself into combat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay you guys,”  Hayate looked at the four remaining people in the helicopter. She was  now running through hallways while speaking to them. “Here is your  mission: You will be divided into two groups, Stars and Lightning.  The object we are after is being carried by a standard eighteen  wheeler truck and trailer. Currently it is with a group of other  trucks that are constantly swapping positions so we can’t be sure  which one currently has the lost logia. Of course the recovery is our  primary focus so whoever gets to the correct truck first will secure  it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Understood,” The  four replied at the same time as Hayate finally made it to her  commanding room and claimed her chair. Her supporters were in chairs  in front of her, bringing up maps and other information for the girl  to read.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Vice-kun, are the  charges set?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rodger!” Vice’s  voice called out cheerfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To avoid further  confusion and conflict, once you investigate a truck you will set a  time bomb that will release a short ranged EMP, forcing the truck to  slow down and stop.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma’am, why don’t  we just stop them first?” Subaru questioned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The Electro Magnetic  Pulse could activate the lost logia, releasing any power it has  stored.” She narrowed her eyes. “I trust I don’t have to  explain what would happen if it went out of control because of a  mistake?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“N-no ma’am…”  Subaru shivered lightly. “We’ll be precise and efficient.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Since this is your  first mission I’ll repeat myself to sooth any uneasiness you may  have,” Hayate smiled at them now, making them lighten up. “Get to  the trucks, inspect the cargo, if it isn’t what we want, set the  time bomb and get onto the next truck and repeat. We will pick you up  by air once you retrieve it and then remotely stop the remaining  trucks.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And the drivers of  the trucks?” Elio questioned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Gadget drones have  already taken them over,” Shari informed regretfully. “ New  mission objective is to rescue the seven drivers.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rodger!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then prepare to  deploy!” Hayate threw out her hand as the helicopter veered away  and down to the road, where seven unmarked truck and trailers were  speeding along the highway. Now with an area to look at, the four  soldiers stood up and braced themselves to jump out when they were  close enough. The air shook them lightly as a shockwave from one of  Nanoha’s attacks flew by, forcing Elio to grab Caro’s hand so she  wouldn’t fall over.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha twirled around  enemy fire, forcing herself through a thicket of drones. Once by, she  looped around and passed by them again, flipping over the group and  spinning them around before destroying them. “Is that enough?”  she asked into the wind, pausing to hover in her spot and plan out  her next wave of attacks against the innumerable mechanical army.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, we have a full  model now,” Shari confirmed. “Thanks for the video feed, we’ll  start recording their statistics when you engage for real.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rodger.” Nanoha  loaded a cartridge into her staff and aimed, ripping a hole through  the mass of metal.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I’m here,  Nanoha.</em>” Fate thought to her friend when she was in range of  telepathic communication. “<em>Brief?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>There are too  many to count,</em>” She replied in kind, looking around until she  spotted her girlfriend. “<em>The forwards are on the trucks below,  we are to secure the air and protect them. I have their data so  destroy as many as you can.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I’m going in,  cover fire for me?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Always,  Fate-chan</em>.” Nanoha braced herself in the air, eyes focusing in  on her opponents. “Accel shooter….forty bullet mode!” The balls  of energy appeared around her quickly before each doubling in size.  ‘<em>One through twenty, follow Fate and protect her… the rest  seek and destroy…</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia landed with a loud  clang on top of the first truck, followed closely by Subaru. Across  from them, several lengths down the road, their two team mates landed  on the last truck. “I’ll take this one,” Tia began, standing.  “You get on the next one, I’ll hop to the third when the first is  disabled.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure.” Subaru  unlocked her wheels on her new blades and instantly slid down the top  of the truck. “Wha, whoa!” Flailing, she tried to regain her  balance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wing road,” Mach  Caliber’s calm voice floated up to her, forming the road and making  the path to the next truck as simple as gliding forward.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Th-thank you!”  Subaru recomposed herself and got serious. “You’re amazing, doing  what I was thinking before I even reacted…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was created to  serve your will.” Subaru dodged to the side to avoid a sudden laser  beam shot at her. “Assault grip.” Mach Caliber stated again,  locking the wheels to the metal as she rolled, giving the girl  complete control. Seconds passed and the drones that had attacked her  were destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-san said you  had a heart…” Subaru smiled. “So I don’t want you to serve  me… Instead, how about we work together?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…We shall see, in  time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The sky lit up with a  brief flash of yellow lightning followed closely by black smoke and  raining metal pieces. Fate’s long hair flew out behind her as the  electricity flared more, shorting out several of the enemy devices.  “<em>They seem to be thinning</em>,” She mentally informed her  friend, who had just blasted several drones attempting to attack the  blond from behind. “<em>How are our soldiers?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Looks like the  last truck is stopping. I think Tia is inspecting the first while  Subaru is defeating the drones from both the leading vehicles.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>And my children?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Moving onto the  next to last truck right now.</em>” Nanoha shot several more bullets  before being forced to move and take to aerobatic evasive movements.  “<em>Fate-chan, I’m going to charge starlight breaker to finish  this, can you thin out the ones not collected in the center?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Yes,</em>” Fate  loaded several cartridges, changing into her sonic form and launching  herself to the outskirts of the aerial battle. Bardiche’s pulsating  blade flared out around her before slashing forward and cleaving  several into pieces.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Energy of the stars,  head to my call…” Nanoha’s hair lifted up slowly as glowing  pink energies flowed around her and began to form.  “Planet…Sky….Sun…Air… loan me some of your energy…” The  clip in her staff emptied itself, speeding up the process. “All  living things spare me some of your will to-” Her heartbeat  resounded in her ears, stopping the chant. Silence reigned over her,  broken only by another heartbeat thundering her ears. ‘<em>No… not  now…not now!</em>’ her hands started to sweat as Raising Heart was  shakily held onto.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Hayate!” Shari  gasped out in fear. “Nanoha-san’s vital signs just jumped off the  chart!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What!?” Hayate  stood up frantically. “Display me her status!” Several screens  appeared in front of her, showing her increasing heartbeat and blood  pressure. “Oh no…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s going into a  seizure!” Shari screamed, hands dancing over the keyboards,  bringing up a visual of the girl in the air.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan!” Hayate  forced an emergency battle contact onto her. “Nanoha-chan’s blood  is going yellow!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s going on!?”  One of the other members asked, looking over her shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You will be informed  later,” Hayate tried to calm herself down as Fate turned her flight  path to head to her friend, not bothering to reply.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Nanoha!” Fate made  it next to her lover and put up a shield around them.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I…can handle…  this…” She replied shakily, obviously in pain. “Go…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No! I-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I said <em>go</em>!”  She screamed, pushing Fate away. “They need… to be covered… or  they’ll…get hurt!” Slowly the girl flew away backwards, leaving  the shield. “Cover me… Fate-chan…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blond looked down  sadly at her before nodding. “I’m coming back in three minutes…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“By then I’ll be  smiling at you…” Nanoha allowed herself to freefall away from  her.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Elio gasped out as the  truck he was standing on suddenly had a hole ripped through the top  of it. A drone he had never seen before rose up steadily, using one  mechanical tentacle to hold onto something that looked like a  briefcase with locks on it. “That has to be it…”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Be careful,  Elio-kun!” Caro ran along the truck that was currently slowing down  thanks to her bomb and leapt onto the one her partner was currently  occupying.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro!” Elio  flashed forward, pushing her out of the way of a large piece of metal  thrown at her. The pink haired girl gasped, looking to her side as  Elio was flung off the truck from the force of it. As if in slow  motion she watched in horror while her friend’s body fell down,  slowly being removed from view.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio-kun!” Her  mind instantly launched out a pink set of chains, looping around his  wrist. The chains went taut quickly, forcing the girl over onto her  stomach and pulling her along the truck as Elio continued to fall. ‘<em>I  can’t pull him up</em>!’ She cried out in fear, tears coming to  her eyes as the chains buried into her hands.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">All at once the girl  stopped sliding and felt something around her waist. Looking up, she  saw Tia holding her with one arm while aiming her gun at the device  with her other. Several shots rang out, making the thing drop the  briefcase. Subaru was already ahead of everyone else, quickly  grabbing it as she flew by on her wing road.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio gasped out,  quickly pulling on the chain connected to his wrist to get the  attention of his friend. Metal sparks flew all around him, grinding  off the metal piece that was beneath his feet. The boy street-surfed  on top of the shrapnel, not holding back his amused grin when Caro  looked over the side of the truck at him. “Pull me up!?” He  asked, gripping his spear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes!” Caro let a  magic field fly beneath her, summoning her power. “Grant this young  knight the power to fly,” She breathed out, sending the energy  through the chain that connected them. “Bless upon him the blade of  warriors…” Her partner flew up beside her quickly, using the  momentum to keep up with the truck while in the air. “And the speed  of an assassin!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio let out his war  cry, holding Strada above his head in preparation to strike. “Caro’s  Knight,” He named his attack as he descended. “Seek!” His blade  cut through the defensive barrier and armor, revealing the core to  the monster. “And destroy!” His body turned, thrusting his spear  into it.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha panted out  weakly, shakily turning Raising Heart’s shaft. The loading bay was  finally covered completely, revealing her emergency single cartridge  loading area. “Loading,” Raising Heart spoke, instantly doing  what was needed so she wouldn’t have to. “Are you ready, my  master?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ye….Yes…”  Nanoha aimed the tip towards herself. “Begin…sealing…” Her  heartbeat resounded again, making her hands shake. Suddenly she was  trying to force Raising Heart away from herself. “Cancel order,”  Her words sounded colder all of a sudden, wisp of yellow flecking the  iris of her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Request denied.”  Raising Heart fired the blast, engulfing the brown haired girl in a  sphere of blue light. “Sealing.” The light shrank down quickly,  covering her body in a light haze. “…Sealed. Are you all right,  my master?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha cried softly.  “It hurts…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please stay still.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can’t,” Nanoha  slowly pushed herself up. “I have to shoot it… I have to help  Fate-chan…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You are in no  condition to battle,” It told her. “Please rest, Master.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let’s shoot it,”  Nanoha hefted her staff and twisted the head back to reveal her  cartridge loading dock and slamming a clip into it. “Load complete,  begin countdown.” Her eyes closed. “<em>Fate-chan?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Are you okay?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Move, I’m  shooting Starlight.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate didn’t argue  with her but instead flew down to the ground.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Vice looked over to the  side and whistled when he saw the high mass of energy flaring into  the sky. “Looks like things up there are cleared out now.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Guess so,” Subaru  agreed, looking up in awe as shrapnel fell. The group stood on the  side of the road, relic safely in hand and drivers all accounted for.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mission complete,”  Shari informed them. “We are dispatching a clean-up crew right now,  the rest of you head back to base for some well deserved rest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes ma’am!” They  all saluted the image, but Subaru looked back up into the sky. “Where  are Nanoha-san and Fate-san…?”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha weakly opened  her eyes, realizing that she felt rather safe and secure for some  reason. “Hey there,” Fate whispered down at her, getting the girl  to look up and behind herself. “How do you feel?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine,” She replied  softly as she realized that she was laying against her lover’s  chest with her back. Fate’s arms were wrapped around her loosely,  simply holding the girl. “How are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A few scratches but  fine,” The red eyed girl replied honestly. “Really…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m weak from  shooting Starlight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know what I  mean, Honey.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha closed her eyes.  “It’s sleeping again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good,” Fate held  her closer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can we stay like  this for a few minutes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes. Yes, we can. As  long as you want to.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“What happened to  Nanoha?” Shari finally asked, looking back over at Hayate.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The brown haired girl  turned off the display showing her two best friends and sat down into  her chair with a relieved sigh. “She’s okay…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma’am!” Shari  pressed on, obviously displeased at not knowing what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s a long  story…” Hayate leaned forward, remembering. “This is classified  information, so nothing leaves this room all right?” Several nods  greeted her so she continued. “It was several years ago, not long  after I became a ranking officer in the TSAB… Nanoha-chan and  Fate-chan were sent on a mission, their first mission with a limiter.  The two didn’t fight very well, both being reduced from triple A to  regular A…” She took a breath before going on. “The two were  caught, taken prisoner, and later rescued. They split up… Fate-chan  met up with Signum to take out the drones, one of the first times we  fought them… Nanoha-chan went after people who had a Lost Logia, a  Jewel Seed to be exact.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Jewel Seed?” Shari  blinked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s a type of  Lost Logia that a certain civilization made,” Hayate explained to  her. “They can manifest themselves into a physical form, or they  can attach to a host, giving them a huge upgrade in power. Although  they normally react to strong feelings and desires, the each have  their own personality. Some good, some bad, some indifferent. The one  that day, however, was clearly evil.” The girl looked over her  hands to the people in the room, each hanging onto her every word. “A  blast was fired, powered by the logia. In order to save countless  people, Nanoha had to try and overpower the attack and absorb  whatever was left into a shield. She managed to counter most of the  attack with her own, but because of her limiter she couldn’t  completely do it and ended up being wounded…mortally…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But she’s alive  and fine now…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let me finish,”  Hayate scolded her gently, already saddened by the story she was  telling. “Vita found her, alone and dieing on the battlefield. She  called for a medical team at the same time as Fate-chan and Signum  checked in with us… Due to the weak AMF fields from damaged robots,  the transmission wasn’t clear; Fate-chan and Signum only heard Vita  say that Nanoha was dieing, and then a scream…” She looked down.  “Fate-chan… found… the people who were responsible.” Her  words made Shari swallow. Obviously ‘found’ wasn’t the only  thing that happened. “She recovered the logia and was informed  Nanoha was still alive. She rushed to her and when she was dieing in  her arms, Nanoha-chan told Fate-chan that she loved her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh my…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan’s  feelings activated the sealed Jewel Seed… Nanoha-chan’s desire to  live and Fate-chan’s fear of losing someone she loved mixed  together and before they realized it, the Jewel Seed merged with  Nanoha, healing her completely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Completely? Just  like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Jewel seeds merge  with things to make their desire come true. The Seed attached itself  and healed the wounds, but also was bound to her in the process. As I  said, they each have their own personality…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So it’s a  parasite?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More like a  symbionite. A parasite finds things and latches onto them to feed off  it…They can be removed. A symbionite merges with their  host…becoming one with them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So Nanoha-san…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Has a corrupt Jewel  seed grafted into her body. Every now and then it will awaken and try  to take over her body, but we can seal it thanks to Shamal’s  medical knowledge. The only thing is, we only thought we would have  to do it once. Several years later it came back, and a few years  after that…and then the next year… then months…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s losing its  effect?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Yes. Now Nanoha  randomly suffers from ‘episodes’, where the seed will awaken and  she has to seal it before it takes her over from the inside out.  We’re currently looking desperately for a way to save her but…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,” Shari  rubbed her eyes. “Okay. I got it. Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl in charge  looked down sadly. ‘<em>The episodes are getting closer and closer  together…It’s only a matter of time until…</em>’</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“And that concludes  the de-briefing,” Rein finished up, smiling at the people in front  of her. “Does anyone need a check up, even for just minor scrapes  or bruises that may seem to hurt more than they should? You never  know if a poison has been used.” The group looked at each other a  moment before all shaking their heads. “Very well then,” Rein  turned to the oldest girls of the group. “Fate-san, Nanoha-san, how  are you two?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tip-top!” Nanoha  cheered happily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m fine, thank  you,” Fate replied softly, looking over at her friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then that’s it.”  Rein let the displays around her fade away. “You are all free to  go!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What now?” Tia  asked her instructor, wondering if there was anything else, despite  being told they could do what they wanted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To Fuji’s!”  Nanoha replied, smiling down at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fuji’s?” Subaru  asked, leaning over to get a look at her. “What’s that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate looked at her  partner. “Nanoha, we are <em>not</em> going to Fuji’s tonight. We  are going straight home.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh don’t be such a  spoil sport!” The brown haired girl put a hand on her hip. “It’s  tradition!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For the air force!”  Fate gasped out. “You are <em>not</em> taking them to Fuji’s!  Especially not Elio-kun and Caro-san!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh they’ll be  fine.” Nanoha waved off the notion and leaned forward, smiling  brightly. “I really want to go after today, all right?” She put  on her best puppy dog eyes she could and felt her lips slowly move up  in a smile when Fate’s resolve weakened. “All right!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s Fuji’s?”  Caro asked Elio in a whisper.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know, but  it sounds like fun.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Nanoha-san drives a  van?” Tia asked, shocked, as her teacher pulled up in front of the  residential area. They had all changed into civilian clothing and had  been waiting for their superiors to come pick them up. “Fate-san  has the newest model of a racing car and Nanoha-san has a mini van…”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I <em>like</em> my  Van!” Nanoha protested as her friends piled in. “Much better than  Fate-chan’s car, it can only hold two people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, my car is  nice!” Fate cried out, obviously offended. “It can run a quarter  mile in seven seconds!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And gets, what, six  miles to the gallon?” Nanoha stuck out her tongue.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So,” Elio  interrupted before the two would argue with each other. “Nanoha-san,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Drop the  formalities, we’re going off base,” Nanoha smiled at him through  the rearview mirror.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aunt Nanoha,” He  continued, “What is Fuji’s exactly?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll see when we  get there. It’s a tradition to go to a place like this on the first  successful mission. I was about Subaru-san and Tia-san’s age when I  first went myself.” The words made Fate snort out, apparently  remembering something funny connected to what was just said.  “Anyway,” she went on before said memory could be shared,  “Vita-chan and Vice-kun are going to meet us there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Elio  mused, leaning back in the seat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The van headed into the  city at a steady pace, turning into the back allies after a while and  then into the flashy night-life style of town. “And here we are!”  Nanoha smiled, shifting her van into park. “And there’s Vita’s  car!” She hopped out to go pounce on the smaller girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mount Fuji’s,”  Subaru read the name of the neon sign. “…This is a bar isn’t  it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Night Club,” Fate  corrected. “But they have alcohol, yes.” She lead the rest of the  troops to the door and waved to the bouncer as they passed by. “The  owner here was a friend of Nanoha’s family back on Earth, er,  non-administrated planet ninety-seven.” The music inside was rather  loud so she spoke up while leading them over to a table. “Believe  it or not, they have really good food here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Subaru  looked around, eyeing a scantily clad girl with a slight blush on her  face. “Is this place all right for the little ones?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” Fate gave  them a light smile. “But Nanoha-chan has been looking forward to  continuing the tradition of celebrating for a while now so…” She  covered Elio’s eyes. “Don’t stare, it’s not polite.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“S-sorry!” He went  rigid at being caught. “I didn’t mean too!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop staring,” Tia  elbowed Subaru in the ribs, making the girl flush.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s hot…”  The girl protested, making Tia blush a moment then turn away in  slight annoyance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Welcome!” A man  greeted them as they sat down. “Oh, Fate-san!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Haseo,” she  greeted with a smile. “How are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Been great, how  about yourself? Haven’t seen you in a while?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We were  re-stationed, I’m sure you heard?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Haseo smirked. “The  new 6th mobile division, I read all about it in the  papers.” He nodded over to the group with the blond. “These your  troops?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They are,” Fate  pointed as she talked. “Subaru, Tia, Elio, and the little girl  hiding behind him is Caro.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Haseo  walked over to the table where the younger members were and leaned  over. “Hey there,” His silver hair reflected a little of the  light at the club. “If anyone here gives you trouble, just get my  attention and I’ll toss’m out okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,” Elio  nodded, now liking this person.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” Caro  replied, coming from behind Elio.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s their first  time, I think Caro is a little nervous.” Fate offered the man,  reaching over to pet the girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well in that case,  I’ll whip up something that’ll make her want to come back!”  Haseo gave a short bow to the small girl before executing a fluid  back flip to get back to the head of the table. A pad was tossed up  from the pouch on his waist and a pen followed suit. The items  twirled in the air a moment before being caught. “May I take your  order?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Haseo is showing off  again,” Nanoha greeted the bartender with a smile, hopping onto a  stool. Vita followed her actions and leaned up against the counter as  well. “You’re not keeping an eye on him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-chan!” The  man smiled brightly. “My, it’s been almost three weeks since you  last came in, I was about to go see if you was okay!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nya haha,” Nanoha  smiled at him and leaned over the bar to give him a hug. “Sorry  about that, Kuhn. Been real busy. I brought my friends with me,  though.” She pointed to the table. “We had our first mission  today so I’m treating them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kuhn flipped his long  blue ponytail over his shoulder. “I see. Drinks all around?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yup!” She nodded  happily. “Oh, um, when is your next restock run…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This week,” He  winked. “Another letter?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please?” She  handed over a small package containing the DVD she recorded earlier.  “You’re the only one who can do it…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t mind at  all. Gives me a reason to see my friends again.” He put it behind  the bar. “What would you like?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fuzzy Navel for me,  the usual for Fate-chan, um, give my other girls something easy since  this is probably their first time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And for you?” Kuhn  turned to Vita.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Give me a daiquiri,  a real daiquiri and don’t bring me one of those sissy-fied neon  slushies either!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Snappy today,  Vita-chan.” Kuhn made small talk as he went about making the  drinks. “Some poor fool try to toss you out?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your bouncer pulled  me off before I could hurt the guy,” She crossed her arms. “But  if someone else calls me “Kiddo” I’m going to knock their head  off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha laughed  nervously. “Don’t get me in trouble please, Vita-chan…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So,” Tia began,  looking around. “The owner here had a mage friend who came to  mid-childa and opened this bar?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And after a while  brought the current owner here from Earth to set up an ‘exotic’  bar,” Fate confirmed. “They mix drinks here using Earth  materials, making them a lot different than what everyone here is  used to. Because he has a special license to transfer items from  other planets, Nanoha normally communicates with her family through  the owner/Barkeep, Kuhn.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmmm,” Subaru  hummed, examining the place they were currently in. They were  currently on a second floor of the building, although it only covered  half of the floor area. The other half was open, showing a dance club  on the bottom floor and the bar where Nanoha and Vita were getting  their drinks. Neon lights decorated the walls, as well as several  plastic bead necklaces and other random things that were probably  used for fashion back on Nanoha’s home planet. From what she could  tell, the bottom part was for partying and the top floor was more  reserved for eating.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry to make you  wait,” Nanoha greeted, carrying a tray of drinks on her palm. Haseo  followed her, looking as if he was nervous about the girl doing his  job. “Here you go,” She twisted the platter and sat it onto the  table, handing out the drinks. “Scotch on the rocks for Fate-chan.”  She placed the old fashioned glass with the amber liquid in front of  her friend. “My drink here,” She sat the Collins glass filled  with orange juice, ice, and vodka at an empty chair. “And for my  Stars members,” She poured them both a glass of beer. “Samual  Adams, always a good decision!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio blinked at the  different types of drinks before he had a glass placed in front of  him as well. “Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Juice for the  lightning squad.” Nanoha winked. “You’re a little young so this  will have to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” Elio  accepted the glass, as did his team mate. Haseo took the now empty  tray and retreated back downstairs as Vita and Vice joined the group.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re all here  now, so…” Nanoha picked up her glass and raised it to the middle  of the table. “To us, for our first successful mission in our new  unit!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To us!” The rest  chorused, each tapping glasses before drinking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey this is kind of  good,” Subaru mused, looking into the liquid before drinking some  more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Drink up!” Nanoha  encouraged happily. “Vice is paying for it all!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey!” he gasped.  “No way, you let one through!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I did!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, Fate did but  it still counts!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan!” Nanoha  turned on her friend, who grinned over the glass in her hands while  taking a very small sip.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“And, and so,”  Subaru giggled merrily while telling her story. “Tia-chan and I  stole all the guy’s underwear that were flirting with us all  day…and and” She put her head down, laughing too much to go on.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And we soaked them  in water and froze them, then ran them up the flagpole!” Tia  finished, also laughing like an idiot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vita snorted at the  story, more amused at the drunk girls than what they were saying.  “Lightweights…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh shush,” Nanoha  nudged her, cheeks slightly red as well. “Just because you don’t  get- hic- drunk, doesn’t mean others can’t!” She smiled down at  her before drinking another large gulp of her beverage. “Haseo!  Heyyyyyyyy, Haseo!” She saw him look over at her so she raised her  empty glass and shook it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Coming up, toots!”  Haseo called back at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  embarrassing…” Vita complained, putting a hand to her head. “Are  you sure this is okay? You go awe fully easy on these people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’ll be fine,”  She waved it off. “Tomorrow is Firesday.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why do you give them  an entire day off?” Vita pondered, finishing her drink and  motioning for another in a more sophisticated manor than her friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Earth thing,”  Nanoha giggled. “First day of the week is a free day to rest”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here you are,”  Haseo placed another full glass of orange juice in front of Nanoha  and also giving Vita a small cocktail glass filled with a cloudy  liquid.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio and Caro sat back  down at the table, having just come back from dancing downstairs at  Nanoha’s insistence. The two noticed the food had arrived and  started getting slices of pizza and hot wings on their plate curtsy  of Fate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are these hot?”  Caro asked, looking at a small wing. Elio licked his fingers after  quickly scarfing one and shook his head. “Okay…” She bit into  it and nibbled the meat off the bone and chewed a few times before  her eyes went wide.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re not hot  but they’re spicy,” Elio finally voiced after swallowing. “..Oh!  you meant if they were ‘spicy’ hot!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro swallowed thickly  and coughed, realizing her drink was gone. “I need a drink…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here’s some  juice,” Nanoha pushed a glass just sat down over towards her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro took the offered  glass and drank all of it in one sitting, gasping out when it was all  gone. “Those things are like <em>fire</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate paused a moment,  looking over at the now empty glass with ice in it. “…Nanoha did  you just give Caro your drink?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” Nanoha picked  up another glass and giggled. “I’m not that stupid.” She took a  long drink out of it and frowned. “Hey, Kuhn forgot to put the  alcohol in this…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate looked over at  Caro, who was looking a little odd. She reached over and picked up  the glass, allowing some of the ice in it to reach her mouth.  Crunching on it, she frowned. “Nanoha-chan! You just gave Caro  vodka!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’ll be fine,”  Nanoha protested, obviously having fallen past the ‘tipsy’ line.  “She’s a big girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s <em>ten</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The entire table looked  over at the pink hired girl, who seemed to be fine after getting the  taste out of her mouth by eating some pizza. “…What?” she asked  meekly. The table got quiet a moment, each debating on if the girl  would be okay or not. Seconds ticked by before Tia and Subaru lost  interest and started laughing at nothing in particular again. With  the silence broken, conversation picked up once more across the  table, leaving no one to hear the small hiccup come from the girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The time went on into  the night, eventually crossing midnight and breaking into the early  morning hours. Caro was leaning against Elio, fast asleep after  running around in a drunken state and dancing all night long. The boy  had one arm around her, occasionally rubbing her shoulder when she  would hiccup in her dreams. Tia and Subaru had calmed down slightly,  now playing drinking games with each other. Vice was cheering them on  while Vita reluctantly joined in. “So,” Fate’s voice caught  Nanoha’s attention again. “How are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha looked over at  her friend a moment before gazing down into her glass, which now held  a dark amber liquid that matched what Fate had been drinking all  night. “I’m still a little scared,” she admitted, taking a sip.  “I was hoping this would make me forget.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll find a way  to stop it.” Fate held her glass by the brim, even if she had  stopped drinking from it long before. “Don’t worry too much about  it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When it does  happen,” Nanoha whispered softly. “When I lose control and go  berserk… You’ll take care of me won’t you, Fate?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The red eyed girl  looked down into her glass sadly. “…No.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You have to!” She  snapped at her, voice saddened. “Don’t let me hurt anyone…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I won’t hurt <em>you</em>,”  She whispered back, suddenly downing the rest of the drink. “It  will never happen.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha looked back over  her glass at the laughing people in front of her. She stayed silent a  moment longer, trying to force unpleasant thoughts from her mind.  “Think it’s time to head back, before they get into any of the  hard stuff?” She decided a change of subject would be the best idea  right now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,” Fate didn’t  move, however. “Can you drive?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No way, can you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m wasted…”  The two girls looked at each other and smiled lightly.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“You owe me,” Haseo  informed them as the people climbed out of the car they were crammed  into. The silver haired man had given them all a ride back to the  entrance of the residential area of the headquarters at their  request.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry; thanks  again.” Nanoha stumbled out of the car, the brisk night air seeming  to ease her mind a little. “Come on everyone. Out.” She helped  Tia and Subaru out of the car, giggling as the two instantly got onto  each other again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re drunk,”  Tia slurred to her friend when she fell onto her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re sexy!”  The blue haired girl replied instantly, pointing at her. “I wanna….  I wanna kiss ya,” Her words mixed together, but she still received  the requested kiss. “Hey, you want to…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh yeah,” Tia  grinned at her a moment before both of them hurried away from the  group and into the building, holding hands and stumbling over each  other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Easy does it,”  Elio whispered, carrying Caro piggy back style. The girl on his back  muttered something about not feeling very well, the alcohol in her  stomach obviously making her woozy. “We’re almost home,” he  soothed her as he also headed towards the building.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“G’night.” Fate  waved to Haseo as he drove off with an amused smile on his face. “I <em>really</em> want to sleep,” She added in. One hand went to rub  the bridge of her nose while the other sought out her girlfriend’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha gripped her hand  gently and the two made their way to the elevator. The ride up was  made quickly and they made their way across the hallway to their  room. After getting in, the pair made a beeline to their bed, where  they collapsed down with their cloths still on. “Sweet dreams,”  She yawned out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sweet dreams,”  Fate replied in kind before putting her face in a pillow and passing  out.</span></p>

Notes:  This will be updated alongside StrikerS series as it airs. The main  goal of this is to not follow the storyline exactly but offer a type of  alternate univers. I have chosen what I want to write already and will  continue to go with it, even when the real series reveals what it  really is. So please just enjoy this for what it is, an AU.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fun facts:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">- The days of the week on Midchilda (at least in  this story) go like this: Firesday - Earthsday - Watersday - Windsday -  Iceday - Lightningsday - Lightsday - Darksday</span></p>
