<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I awoke slowly, pushing  myself up in bed groggily and half wondering why the sun was already  up. “Good Morning, my master.” Raging Heart immediately greeted  me. “Your schedule has been changed. You have no appointments to  keep today.” I coughed lightly, frowning at how my throat felt. A  groan escaped my lips as I crawled off the bed and made a face at the  blood stains on the sheets. “Please do not stress yourself today,  my master.”</span></p>
</span>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Diamond  Dust II</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By:  Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha opened her mouth  to reply, but a sharp pain in her throat made her stop and lapse into  a coughing fit. Falling to her knees, she held her throat and tried  to calm herself down. Quickly she found someone rubbing her back and  offering her an inhaler, which she took. A quick dose of whatever was  inside it soothed her down instantly, once again letting her breathe  normally. The girl turned to look at Shamal and offered an apologetic  smile. “Here, sit on your bed a moment.” Nanoha found herself  being helped up and she obediently sat down. “Let me observe you  please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A few minutes went by  in silence as Shamal gave her a check up. “Well, good news and bad  news,” She spoke after a while. The blond removed the tongue  depressor and sighed. “Good news is that the stuff in your system  is in our records and I already got you medicine to take to cure it.  Bad news is, it’s an inhalant and takes a while to work. Your  throat is pretty messed up, Nanoha-chan. Does it hurt?” She got a  short nod. “Do you think you can talk?” This time she shook her  head. “I see. In that case, the best course of action would be to  take medicine and come in every day for a check up. I want you to  take a breath from this inhaler every hour… every thirty minutes  would be better for the first day… after that, once an hour will be  fine.” The woman gave her a soft look. “I’m sorry there’s not  much else we can do in the mean time.” Her reply was a smile. “Come  on downstairs,” Shamal looked at her. “You might want to change  shirts first, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha looked down,  seeing her favorite night shirt ripped down the front and missing a  few buttons. She let out a soft sigh and gently rubbed her chest  where there were faint red marks from her nails and a soft bruise  from where Fate had to get forceful with her. “Don’t mind, my  master.” Raging Heart spoke to her comfortingly. To reply, Nanoha  gave the red gem a small kiss before changing into casual clothing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-chan, good  morning!” Fate greeted her happily. “How do you feel?” She got  a smile and a nod. “Does your throat hurt any?” Her friend shook  her head. “…You can’t talk can you?” Nanoha scratched her  cheek, making Fate instantly start to freak out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now now,” Shamal  Pet Fate on the head to make the girl calm herself. “She’ll be  able to speak again in a day or so.” She smiled at Nanoha. “I  already told Fate so I’ll let you know as well, the necklace you  have on is a magic trinket.” She watched Nanoha touch the inch wide  yellow necklace encircling her neck. Although it appeared to be on  her skin directly, Nanoha didn’t seem to even feel it. “It will  monitor how well you are breathing. When it gets darker and starts  turning red it means that your breath is getting short. Anything that  gets close will instantly alert me so I can check on you. Eventually  it will turn green, which means you are A-ok again.” She gave the  girl a firm look. “Nanoha-chan, please don’t do anything that  will make me worry?” She paused a moment. “Wait, never mind.  Raging Heart, don’t let Nanoha do anything that will worry me  okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All Right,” The  necklace spoke up, making Nanoha give the older woman a pout.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Nanoha-chan, I  really think you should rest for the day.” Fate told her friend as  they walked down the halls of their office building. “You should be  in bed!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I’m fine,</em>”  Nanoha spoke to her mentally. “<em>You’re worrying too much.</em>”  The girl sat down at her desk and put her purse on the floor next to  her. “<em>I have too much paper work to do; I should use this time  to get caught up.</em>” Several transparent monitors appeared around  her. The female went to start typing but a sudden pain in her arm  reminded her that her left arm was currently incapacitated at the  moment. “<em>Not a word, Fate-chan.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blond covered her  mouth, obviously pleased that her friend had just embarrassed  herself. “Come on, I scheduled myself to fill in for your teaching  since Vita is on a mission right now.” Fate reached out for her  hand and got it when Nanoha stood up and re-collected her purse.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>It’s going to  be a loooooong few days.</em>”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha’s students  were shocked when they saw their teacher to say the least. Rushie had  instantly ran over to her and asked what happened while the others  stood in disbelief at seeing their instructor with a sling and a  monitoring device around her neck. “She had an accident on a  mission is all,” Fate informed the pink haired girl as they walked  to the rest of the group. “Instructor Nanoha is unable to speak  right now because of certain reasons so until she gets better I will  be in charge of your training, along with Vita if she gets back  before this is over.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma’am!” Subaru  raised her hand, getting Fate to look at her. “Will Instructor  Nanoha be all right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry,”  Raging Heart told them as Nanoha stepped up to stand next to Fate.  “My master will be fine,” It continued.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I was planning on  making them run team work exercises today,” </em>Nanoha sent to Fate  as she looked at them. “<em>Subaru and Tia work well together  already but the others just met each other so they don’t have any  form of unity as a team just yet.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,” Fate  nodded. “We’re doing teamwork today. A flurry of monitors came to  her call around the girl, as well as keyboards. Typing quickly, she  formed a type of jungle on the training field. “Tia and Elio, you  will be group one. Subaru and Rushie you will be group two. Your  goals will be to find each other in the jungle and then proceed to  find the target base and destroy it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma’am!” They all  saluted.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“I’m starving,”  Fate greeted Hayate at the mess hall, falling into a chair with a  tray in front of her. “How is your day?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As good as it gets,”  She replied around a few French fries. “Not much happening right  now so I’m doing standard paper work and trying to get a few  A-class mages to join our division.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That would be nice,”  Fate agreed as Nanoha sat down with nothing but a drink. “Nanoha,  is that all you’re going to get for lunch?” She watched her  friend point to her neck, making her instantly feel horrible. “…It’s  that bad?” Nanoha looked down a moment before lifting head back up  and smiling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I talked to Shamal  already,” Hayate told her, watching Nanoha take a quick puff from  her inhaler before she decided to drink her fruit smoothie. “I feel  so bad for you.” Nanoha waved it off. “I cleaned your schedule  for the next three days, so please use the time to get some rest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See, I <em>told</em> you that you should rest.” Fate got a mean look from Nanoha. “I <em>know</em> you’re a tough girl, but even tough girls need a rest  every now and then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Telepathy?” Hayate  inquired, nibbling her food. “That will come in handy. Too bad  doing it to several people at once is both annoyingly difficult and  not to mention draining.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. Nanoha-chan  talks to me and I say what she’s thinking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ooh, how sweet.”  Hayate teased. “You’re her words, just like a couple.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re not…well….  Um…” Fate looked over at Nanoha, who instantly blushed. The girl  looked down a moment, as if thinking, before looking back up and  smiling at Fate, nodding her head happily. “We sort of are…a  couple I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh my, you both  finally bit the bullet and asked each other out?” Hayate looked  surprised.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Seeing you two flirt  all the time and it not lead anywhere was annoying!” Rein added in,  flying over to them and catching the tail end of the conversation.  “Honestly, you can’t keep your hands off each other for five  minutes and it took this long?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Both girls looked away  in embarrassment.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha looked up  boredly as Fate walked into the door of their loft. “I’m home,”  the blond informed her as she walked over to the couch and sat down  next to her lying friend. “Anything good on T.V.?” she watched  her girlfriend shake her head as she flipped channels, finally  stopping on something that didn’t really interest her but was  better than nothing. “I’m done for the day,” Fate added,  allowing one hand to rest on Nanoha’s head, stroking it much like  she would pet a dog. “Since it started to rain, I cancelled the  rest of practice and told them to make different level cartridges so  tomorrow I’ll go over how to conserve them and when to splurge on  them.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Oh?</em>” Nanoha  looked up at her and crawled to a sitting position before slinging  her legs over on top of her friends so she was sitting on the couch  sideways. <em>“I didn’t know it started to rain.”</em> Her words  drifted into Fate’s heart as she put an arm around her back. In  response, Nanoha draped her good arm over Fate’s shoulders and gave  her a happy look. “<em>Ne, Fate-chan?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?” The slightly  taller girl looked over at her friend, finding it amusing all their  conversations today had been one-sided since she couldn’t talk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha looked into  Fate’s eyes and scooted a little closer. “<em>About last night…</em>”  Her words were a little nervous; despite them not being spoken, Fate  could still feel the uneasiness in the communication. “<em>Can I…  hear it again? Fate-chan’s feelings?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha…” Fate  knew how she felt as well. It had been late when the words were said,  and after a very scaring moment to boot. Somewhere deep in the back  of her mind she wanted confirmation as well, something more than just  a nod and saying that they were a couple with a giggle. “I…”  She brought a hand upward to gently trail a finger over her friend’s  cheek. “I really care about you,” she whispered out as her hand  went behind Nanoha’s ear, gently pulling her face closer. “Deeply,”  She continued as their foreheads were placed together. “I love you,  Nanoha. With everything I have to offer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fa…..te…” She  managed out, closing her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shhhh, you don’t  have to speak.” She shushed her quietly. “I want to hear it  again…but you can tell me any way you want to…” The arm around  her shoulders shifted lightly and moved so Nanoha’s elbow was  behind her neck, pulling her body closer as the brown haired girl  cuddled up on her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Now that they were  closer and touching more, Nanoha gave Fate her answer. Gently her  lips found the blonde’s and she pressed them together in a light  kiss. When it ended, she looked into her girlfriend’s eyes again,  once more kissing but keeping her slate blue orbs gazing into her red  ones instead of closing them again.  The kiss ended reluctantly but  Fate’s fingers lightly threaded through her hair and gently urged  her back for another contact. One kiss changed into two or three,  then four or five. The number was lost after that, each girl pulling  back just enough to get a little air while looking at each other  longingly. The pony tailed girl took the moment to reach out her hand  and form a translucent keyboard at her motion. She looked behind Fate  at the monitor and pushed the buttons that would turn off the TV and  also kill the lights as well. The action made Fate blush instantly,  but what followed made even the tips of her ears turn red in  embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha leaned back  slowly, pulling the other girl down with her as she did so. From  their position they landed on the couch awkwardly, forcing Fate to  change how she was laying. She ended up settling with propping  herself above the girl on her hands and knees. One of her legs was  between hers and the other pressed tight between the side of the  couch and Nanoha’s. The girl on bottom looked up at her with a  gentle gaze, asking a silent question if what she just did was all  right or not. Her free hand was still on Fate’s neck, slowly  running her finger tips from where her shoulders met her neck and up  into her hairline before going back down again. The motions made Fate  calm down a little and lose most of the nervousness that had grabbed  a hold of her when she was pulled down. “If I start,” She  whispered, leaning down and putting both hands under Nanoha’s neck  to gently rub. “I don’t think I could stop…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I wouldn’t want  you to…</em>” Nanoha mentally told her, instantly getting attacked  by Fate’s lips. The kissing this time was more passionate, each one  being replaced by another deeper kiss. Nanoha’s good hand instantly  went to rub Fate’s back, sliding up her shirt to make contact with  her skin. Their mouths became wetter, kisses starting to get more  frantic and missing each other’s lips in their hurry to start a new  one before the old was even finished.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before she even  realized it, Fate had both hands under Nanoha’s shirt, rubbing her  sides and occasionally across her stomach. The warm fingers trails to  the waistband of her skirt before pressing close against her skin and  running all the way up to under her arms, where they looped to grab  her shoulders before moving back down again. Each pass made the  blonde’s resolve weaken even less, finally reaching the break away  point where her palms were running over the fabric of Nanoha’s bra.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl replied with  an encouraging sound, pushing her chest upwards. The movement caught  Fate by surprise, making her hands slips under the fabric instead of  on top as she had intended. She paused briefly to wonder if she  should try and stop, but Nanoha lifted herself up again, silently  asking what the hold up was. With nothing else to make her restrain  herself, Fate quickly pulled her girlfriend’s shirt up completely  to reveal her breast. She allowed herself to pull back from her soon  to be lover’s lips to gaze down passionately, amazed at how even  though she had seen Nanoha naked countless times before, she was  suddenly turned on by the simple sight. Her hands went to work as her  mouth sought out her lips again. Gently she cupped her breast and  massaged, making Nanoha gasp out roughly in passion.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate, stop that!”  The voice made the girl instantly jerk back, shocked and scared. “No  wonder I got an alert!” Fate realized that Nanoha wasn’t the one  who had spoken and her eyes quickly darted around, finally seeing a  monitor in front of her with Shamal’s red face. Fate sat up  quickly, embarrassed and trying to stammer out something in reply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha instantly  shuffled behind Fate in an attempt to hide herself. She put her head  behind Fate’s shoulders and shakily tried to fix her shirt and  button the clasp that she didn’t even recall Fate undoing with her  one good hand. Her breath was short and ragged from the encounter and  embarrassment, making her cough slightly as she attempted to fix the  last button. Finally she realized that she was starting to have  problems breathing and fell off the couch, reaching for her inhaler.  A quick inhale made her feel so much better that she decided to take  another, and then a third.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh my god, are you  all right?” Fate got behind her and rubbed her back soothingly,  looking at the girl in fear as she wiped the tears from her eyes  caused by the sudden fright.  Nanoha nodded briefly, taking a long  slow intake through her nose before letting it out her mouth before  nodding again as if to confirm it to herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you have any idea  how worried I was when I suddenly got a warning signal saying that  Nanoha was having trouble breathing?” Shamal scolded Fate, getting  into one of her rare serious modes. “I was about to run over there  in the rain!” She watched Fate look over at Nanoha and, indeed, see  the necklace she was wearing was more of an orange-ish color than  yellow. “I told you not to do anything to make me worry,  Nanoha-chan!” The words made the younger girl sink back to try and  hide again, blushing horribly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha brought her hand  to her chest and tried to calm herself down again.’ <em>I just got  caught making out,</em>’ She thought to herself, face getting  hotter. ‘<em>I just got caught making out while rounding second  base!</em>’ Her mind added on for her. ‘<em>I just got caught  making out while rounding second base by SHAMAL</em>’ The final part  made her lose it completely and she grabbed the back of Fate’s  shirt and hid her face in the hair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And another thing,”  Shamal was going on, but paused as someone walked into the room. “Ah  Signum, welcome back!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you yelling at  someone?” She asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, you wouldn’t <em>believe</em> what Fate just did!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t tell her!”  Fate screamed as the monitor blipped off. “Oh no, anyone but  Signum!” The dark room stayed silent a moment, only sounds coming  from the ever increasing patter of rain splashing onto the window.  Fate felt Nanoha’s hands let go of her shirt and reach around  shakingly to hug her from behind. “Are you okay?” She asked  gently, taking the hands around her and rubbing them. She got a small  nod against her back and the two sat there a moment more before the  brown haired girl finally stood up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Let’s take a  nap?</em>” She asked silently, helping Fate to her feet and taking a  small amount of satisfaction in the fact that she looked a little  unsteady after the intimate relation they just shared. A nod answered  her and the two held hands as they walked up the stairs. Nanoha undid  her skirt with one hand and let it simply fall to the floor before  stepping out if it and fumbling with the buttons to her shirt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate came to her rescue  and helped her, gently guiding her sore arm through the sleeve and  undoing the sling so she could rest without having it pinned against  her side. The blush had never left her cheeks in the first place, but  she found it growing as she watched Nanoha reach behind herself and  unclasp her bra. Shyly she turned around and started to undress  herself while Nanoha slid on a long nightshirt that went to her  knees. Minutes later, Fate was also changed, sitting on the  now-cleaned sheets of the bed before crawling over to the middle  where Nanoha was. The brown haired girl smiled at her, scooting  closer so their fronts were touching and her face was close enough to  hers that she felt her breathe. “Hey,” She greeted her softly,  getting a peaceful look in reply, followed by a gentle kiss. “When  you get better…” She closed her eyes a moment in embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>When I’m better  we’ll continue,</em>” Nanoha finished for her, closing her eyes as  well. “<em>And next time, we’ll be in bed…That couch isn’t  really comfortable to lay on.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate couldn’t help  but to laugh. “Okay. Next time, in bed, with nothing to interrupt  us.” They stayed quiet for a while, simply listening to the rain  while holding each other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Hey Fate?”</em> Nanoha finally asked before her girlfriend drifted off to sleep. She  got a small hum to show her she was listening. <em>“I love you,  Fate.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I know,</em>”  The words drifted into Nanoha’s heart soothingly. “<em>I know,  sweetheart. I love you too.”</em></span></p>
