<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My dream  faded around me when I felt the back of my neck being breathed on.  Normally I wouldn’t mind since Nanoha always seemed to do that whenever  my back wasn’t pressed against the wall, but this time I felt my hair  being shifted to the side and gentle lips being placed on the base of  my neck. Against my will a content moan escaped as I snuggled back up  against the girl teasing me. The motion got me a quiet happy giggle and  I felt her arm wrap around my waist, hand instantly going to my breast.  Purring, I felt the lips return to kissing me as I squirmed in her  hold, smiling brightly. Of all the ways to be awoken in the morning  time, <em>this</em> was by far my favorite.</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shhh,”  Nanoha whispered softly, trailing her other hand lower after sliding  around so she would be half on top of her. “Caro-chan’s in the shower.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll be fast,” Fate moaned out contently when Nanoha’s hand found that <em>spot</em>.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t know how long we have, I just woke up,” Nanoha licked Fate’s ear  slowly, making the blond shiver and wiggle in her grasp.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then stop teasing me,” The red eyed girl rolled over in her arms and met her mouth in a solid deep kiss.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  out,” Caro informed them as the bathroom door opened, making both girls  instantly push away from each other. “I’m sorry, did I wake you two?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“N-no, we always get up around this time when we sleep in,” Nanoha blushed, laughing nervously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did you have a nice shower?” Fate sat up in bed and held the covers to her chin, adjusting her clothing properly behind them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  it was very relaxing.” Walking over to them, Caro gave both girls a  good morning hug. “Thank you for letting me stay with you last night,  even though I just did the night before too…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t mention it,”  Nanoha smiled at her honestly. “Anytime you have a nightmare you can  come to us. If we don’t answer the door right away, just knock harder.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay!” Caro smiled brightly. “Can I make you breakfast as a thank you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That would be wonderful,” Fate confirmed smiling as the pink haired girl nodded happily, trotting downstairs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha fell back on her bed and sighed out. “We haven’t made love in three days, I’m going through withdrawal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Three days? That has to be some sort of record when we’re together, miss bunny.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slate blue eyes looked over at her sideways. “I never heard you complain before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blond put on the most innocent look she could muster up. “I don’t know what you mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If I’m a bunny then that would make you a Jack Rabbit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey!” Fate smacked her girlfriend lightly with a pillow, blushing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  stayed quiet a moment, listening to Caro mess around downstairs.  “Hey…It’ll take at least ten minutes before she can walk away from  cooking…?” She lifted an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…She’ll hear!” Fate whispered  softly, embarrassed. The look on Nanoha’s face clearly told her that  she didn’t really have a choice in the matter. “Mou, you pervert.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nya haha,” Nanoha leaned up and over rubbing their noses together. “I love you, Fate-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hehe,  I love you too.” She counter rubbed and grinned at her. The two leaned  to kiss, but a sudden knocking at the door made them both sigh and move  away from each other. “Yes, who is it!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Private Elio, ma’am!” The voice from the door called up to them</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro-chan could you let him in please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes ma’am!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two lovers looked at each other a moment more before reluctantly sliding out of bed and getting dressed.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“…Ugh…  Wha…” The world slowly came into focus as Subaru opened her eyes. The  roof above her blurred slightly from the lights, hurting her pupils in  the process. Her field of view shifted to the side, seeing an I.V. drip  slowly while running a fluid into her arm. With a groan her memories of  being defeated in battle came back to her. She tried to bring a hand up  to rub her face but found that she couldn’t quite seem to manage the  feat. Upon inspection she noticed that Tia’s upper body was lying on  her bed, hand gripping hers while asleep. “Tia…”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The pistol user  looked up at the beckoning of her name lightly, blinking a few times to  clear her mind. “Su…Subaru!” All at once she slid over closer to the  girl’s face, still gripping the hand. “Are you okay!? Do you hurt  anywhere!? Can I get you anything!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia…” Subaru smiled, closing her eyes and laying back. “Did you hold my hand all this time?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“….Maybe.”  She gave the hand a small squeeze. “We’ll talk about that later, how  are you?” Her panicking dropped quickly when the girl didn’t seem to be  in any pain.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stiff. My body won’t listen to me. Was I hurt that bad?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia nodded slightly. “Yeah. Yeah, you got tossed around quite a bit. I’m sorry for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  happened?” She wondered, looking as if she was still dazed and tired.  “All I remember is seeing you and thinking to myself ‘I’m saved, Tia  will help me’ and then a blinding pain…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia blinked, sending a single tear down her cheek. “I’m sorry… I’m so sorry Subaru… If it wasn’t for me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,  don’t cry? Why would you cry?” The blue haired girl finally managed to  move her hand and clumsily wipe away the smear of water. “Tia, you  never cry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I cry all the time, you know that,” She countered,  re-gripping the hand with both of hers. “You always gave me that damned  stuffed turtle when you thought I was sad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru smiled at the memory of their boot camp. “And you would protest about it being stupid but would still sleep with it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you bought me my own teddy bear on my birthday.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You still sleep with it,” Subaru finished the thought happily. “Tia… You forgive me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For being so self-centered?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  two looked at each other a moment before Tia closed her eyes. “I’m the  one who should be apologizing, Subaru… I shouldn’t have said those  things.” Slowly she took a breath.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m just  scared,” She rubbed Subaru’s hand gently. “I’m scared and I’m nervous  and I’m unsure and, and, I’m a lot of other things.” A moment of  silence washed over them before she could continue. “But…when I thought  I might lose you… Everything else didn’t matter anymore. All I wanted  then was to be able to see you smile again… I wanted another chance to  do things over again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you mean?” The girl looked like she was about to fall asleep again at any moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru…Just get some rest, we can talk later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay.  Keep holding my hand?” She got a small curt nod. “Thank you…” Slowly  her eyes closed and she drifted off to sleep once again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘… <em>I couldn’t tell her…</em>’</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha  smiled down at her students as they lay smoking on the ground beneath  her. “Do you think we hurt them?” She asked merrily as she swung her  legs underneath the tree branch she was sitting on. “Maybe it was too  early for them to go up against two people at the same time?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nah,  they’re just tired from the mission and non-stop training afterwards.”  Yuuno waved it off with one hand, the other in his pocket. The male was  clad in a new version of his barrier jacket which consisted of blue  jean pants with silver trim, pitch black boots highlighted in the same  silver, and a tank top shirt also void of color. “You know, Caro-san  has a lot of potential. Her spells really boosted up everyone’s power.”  He looked over at the pink girl who was currently so tired she appeared  to be asleep on her back. “Did you notice that her spells particularly  effected-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes I did,” She cut him off. “We’re looking into that.” Nanoha gave him a look that clearly read ‘we’ll talk about it later’.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I seeeeee,” he let the word linger as Tia pushed herself up. “Oh, is it time for round two?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You guys are ruthless…” Tia whispered shakily. “I can barely stand, let alone fight…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If Caro-san hadn’t given us all her magical power…” Elio spoke from the ground, too weak to stand. “We wouldn’t have lasted <em>this</em> long.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A support mage is the best kind of mage,” Yuuno agreed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, flying mages are the best!” Nanoha countered instantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No way, where would you be right now without me and my barriers?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right here, just not as pretty,” Nanoha stuck out her tongue at him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pretty. Right.” He chuckled to himself, enjoying the chance to play with his best friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey! I am pretty! Fate-chan tells me everyday!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure  sure, if ‘Fate-chan’ says so,” Yuuno shrugged playfully, teasing Nanoha  enough to jump off her branch and storm over to him, looking up. “Hello  there, Nanoha, have you gotten shorter?” His hand was placed on her  head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve grown an inch!” She countered, flailing out her arms. “You’re just are abnormally tall!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia  looked over her shoulder towards Elio. “I don’t know if they’re best  friends or enemies…” The pair watched the older people continue to  argue a moment longer before Nanoha finally went in for the kill.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno-kun, stop arguing with me, you know I’m right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are not!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl pointed to her chest. “Yuuno-kun what are these?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Boobs?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And do you have any?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Therefore I win by default.” She crossed her arms and nodded to herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where’s the logic in <em>that</em>!?” The male almost screamed, blushing. “Females don’t instantly win, that’s not fair!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Life isn’t fair,” She cooed at him, winking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It could at least be not fair in my favor… Besides, you barely have any breast; I’ve seen guys with larger boobs than you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>What</em>!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno  grinned and waved. “On that note, I’m going to get some food, buh-bye!”  Without waiting for an answer he leapt into the air and sped away  before Nanoha could even realize that he had made an escape.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Grumbling,  Nanoha walked over to her students. “Stupid ferret…He doesn’t have to  make fun of me… I’m still growing… lots of girls don’t get large breast  this early in life…” She helped Elio to his feet and walked over to  Tia. “I mean, sure, I’m still only an A-cup but it’s not like…” Nanoha  paused, looking down at Tia.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…What?” She asked nervously, realizing Nanoha’s gaze was on her chest. “…They’re C…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmph!” The older woman walked past her, turning up her nose, in favor of picking up Caro.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Fate-san,  where have you been!?” The secretary of the office building called out  to the blond when she walked through the doors. “Hayate-san has been  looking for you for the past hour!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What, why?” Fate blinked, walking over to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The new members are here today for the welcoming ceremony! Didn’t you get the memo?!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It said it was next month!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  was pushed forward, we told everyone!” The secretary looked frantic as  it was, obviously having way too much work for her to handle on her  own. “We made sure to post it on all the desk and on the notice boards  and-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was undercover and teaching the forwards how to do it as well this past <em>week</em>!”  Fate almost screamed at her. “I haven’t come in this office since then;  Hayate-chan should know that!” One hand went to her mouth to nervously  bite her nails. “Okay, I can deal with this. How long do I have to  prepare my welcoming speech?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fifteen minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What!?” Fate gasped out openly. “Okay… okay…” She took a slow breath. “What after that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You were assigned to review their history and position them where they need to be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not so bad, how many?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Twenty. We need this done by end of the day tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate almost collapsed. “On top of the paperwork I let build up on me the past week… Can I get some assistance?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry  ma’am, we’re all backlogged as well. Expanding to cover local area  police force and civilian protection has made us all double our work;  we’re still severely understaffed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well we’re only a month old…Right then, I’m going to see Hayate-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please do,” She saluted Fate briskly before going back to work.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Tia  opened the door to Subaru’s room slowly, peeking her head in to check  if the girl was asleep or not before heading in. “She’s gone,” Shamal’s  voice came from behind her, making Tia almost slam her head in the door  from shock. “Tia-san, don’t think I’m not aware of you sneaking in  after I kick you out. You know when visiting hours are.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“S-sorry!” Tia saluted her quickly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not that I don’t know how you feel, but when I tell you to scoot then it’s probably because I think the patient needs to <em>rest</em>, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes ma’am.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  please take care of her and let the poor child get plenty of rest okay?  Nanoha-chan came by and picked her up earlier. Subaru-san should be in  your dorm room, do<em> not</em> let her stress herself for another few days.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes ma’am.” Tia shifted nervously. “Um, I really am sorry about disobeying order like that. I was just really, <em>really</em> nervous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  let it bother you; Fate-chan and Nanoha-chan were worse.” Shamal let  out a sigh. “When one of them got hurt bad enough to be put in a  hospital bed the other one would instantly teleport over and stay with  them until they got better. You wouldn’t believe the crap Admiral  Chrono had to go through because of that. If it had been any normal  mage and not a child prodigy…” Shamal shook her head suddenly. “I’m  rambling. Go on, go take care of your friend, and be sure to put the  lotion on her bruises all right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you ma’am!” Tia smiled  at her before saluting one final time and running off. The path to the  residential area was made as quickly as she could manage without making  herself look like she was running. Upon entering she waited impatiently  for the elevator to get to the bottom floor and was pleasantly  surprised to find some new members of the 6th division board with her,  each saluting their senior in the force. The elevator stopped on the  second floor to allow some of the new red-shirts to leave before Tia  finally managed to get to her own floor and over to the room she shared  with Subaru. Upon entering she saw Nanoha drying her room mate’s hair  while chatting happily with her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, Tia,” Subaru greeted her. “Shamal-sensei released me today.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, she told me,” Tia blushed lightly, suddenly feeling embarrassed at seeing her with only a towel on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well  if Tia-san is here, I’ll leave the rest up to her.” Nanoha gave Subaru  a pat on the head before standing. “I have a little paperwork to do  thanks to the new recruits.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh they’re here?” Subaru pondered,  looking up at her teacher from the bed. “They are going to be local  police for the city right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s right. The sixth division  will protect on a local basis and help with disaster relief as well as  important things. We will handle only the important stuff, and train  when not on a mission, just as before. The new people are technically  part of us, but they will be run a little separately.” The girl let out  a sigh. “I’m not even going to get to train them but once every other  week or so. They didn’t even need me at the welcoming ceremony…  Anyway,” She smiled at Tia on her way out of their room. “I need to go  shopping, my farmer called me today.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Farmer?” Tia pondered, too curious to let it slide by.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  I met a middle aged farmer named ‘Elk’ several years ago when the Asura  was on shore leave. He was severely understaffed to pick his small  field so I helped him out.” Nanoha giggled at the memory. “I even  helped him sell things on his little farmer’s stand, and as payment he  gave me a bushel of peaches.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh that’s right,” Subaru realized. “I’ve heard people joke about you and peaches.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Love them,” Nanoha winked. “So I’m going to pick some up!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia shook her head as the woman finally left. “Nanoha-san…sometimes I don’t know if she’s older or younger than me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But that’s what makes her so great,” Subaru winced lightly when she tried to move. “Ow…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s wrong?” Tia sat on the bed next to her and put a hand on her bare shoulder. “Do you hurt?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  my ribs,” She complained softly, closing her eyes in annoyance. “I can  move around now that I’m used to not being in bed again, but  Shamal-sensei told me that I have a broken rib and two cracked ones, so  it hurts a lot when I shift my upper body. Rapid healing magic isn’t a  good idea since you can’t set ribs in proper place…I’m going to have to  tough this one out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see…” Tia looked at Subaru a moment  before slowly reaching out and putting an arm around her shoulders.  “Um, if you need anything, just ask me okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru blushed darkly and looked down. “Thank you…Tia?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, Subaru?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um… can you help me get dressed…?” She looked up nervously, laughing slightly.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate  groaned softly as the door to her apartment was opened. Stepping into  the dark room she kicked off her shoes without even bothering to bend  over to properly remove them. Once free from the restraints she used  one foot to scoot them out of the way of the door and walked over to  the stairs. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I shouldn’t be here,</span></em>’ her mind complained as she sleepily and angrily walked up the steps. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I don’t have time to sleep, I have so much I need to-</span></em>’  her thoughts were cut off when she suddenly tripped and fell to the  floor. “Dammit Nanoha, I told you several times to not leave your  clothes all over the floor!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ugnnn….?” Nanoha opened her eyes  slightly, still half asleep on the bed. “Sorry Fate-chan…” No sooner  than she said the words than did she drift back off to sleep once again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate growled and tossed the fabrics across the room and into a basket that held most of her own dirty clothes. ‘<em>Can this day get –any- worse?</em>’  She unbuttoned her uniform and placed it on the back of her desk chair  before stripping the rest of the way down and crawling into bed, not  bothering to even get into her night cloths. ‘<em>Everything went wrong today and to top it all off I worked until…</em>’ A quick glance at her clock told her the time. ‘<em>Two in the morning, great. I have three and a half hours to sleep before doing it –all- over again.</em>’ With a groan she got under the covers and pressed her back up against the wall.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan,”  Nanoha whispered out, crawling over to her and cuddling. Her leg slid  between Fate’s a moment before she winced. “Ew, Fate-chan, shave you  legs, you’re like a porcupine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you don’t like it, don’t cling on me,” She retorted, miffed at the statement after her long day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Jeez,”  Nanoha muttered sleepily, moving away from her. “Someone’s cranky.” She  didn’t get a reply so she closed her eyes, once more going back to  sleep. A few moments passed before she was awoken briefly by Fate  turning over onto her back. Once she managed to get back to sleep she  was awoken again by Fate turning around and muttering something about  work. A third time she was awoken by her room mate when she asked  Bardiche to remind her of something in the morning. Finally a fourth  time made her groan when Fate shifted once more. “Fate-chan, stay <em>still</em> please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re not the only one who can’t sleep,” She snapped at her. “I can’t get comfortable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  frowned into the darkness and rolled over so her back was facing Fate.  Slowly her mind began to drift off once again before her girlfriend  reclaimed her back to wall position and pulled the covers to cover  herself. “I can’t deal with this,” She finally spoke up, moving so her  feet slid off the bed and grabbing two pillows. “I’m sleeping on the  couch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ugh fine,” Fate pulled the covers more and tried to hide herself from the world. “I want to be alone anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>You want a hug, you dumb girl,</em>’ Nanoha thought to herself as she walked down the stairs. ‘<em>If you have a day –that- bad you can at least tell me instead of just snapping at me, jeez.’ </em>The girl tossed her pillows onto the couch and lay down, pulling the throw comforter down to cover herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  morning light came soon, forcing Nanoha to cover her head with the  blanket since she was directly under the large windows. Awoken once  more, she heard Fate move around upstairs and get dressed before coming  down. A moment passed before she sighed out. “Nanoha-chan are we out of  coffee?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” She muttered, trying to bury herself under the dark covers to try and get some more sleep.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why didn’t you tell me so I could buy some?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I <em>did</em>, Fate.” Nanoha growled, dropping the honorific to show that she was currently annoyed. “Please, just let me sleep!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At least <em>one</em> of us can sleep,” She muttered, going to put on her shoes before  heading back out to work. “By all means, enjoy!” The door closed a  little harder than she intended it to, but she currently didn’t care.  Already she was dreading the multiple stacks of paper on her desk that  she <em>should</em> have done instead of wasting her time by coming home.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  path towards the office building was made quickly with no one else to  bother her. Currently it was still too early for even the morning bird  joggers to be out on their routes, a fact that made Fate even more  annoyed that she had to spend the next thirteen hours sitting at a desk  while other people were snoring in their beds. Upon entering the  building she nodded to the secretary who was just swapping places with  the one that she was more familiar with. “Morning,” She greeted briskly  as she headed to the elevator. The ride up was short and she walked  through the almost empty floor full of cubicles and office furniture.  Her desk was sectioned off from the rest, having its own room with  glass walls complete with in-glass blinds in case she ever wanted  privacy. The door opened to her beckoning, having forgotten to lock it  the day before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Inside was neat and clean, decorated with  countless pictures and award certificates. Her chair cushioned her fall  as she flomped back into it and popped her knuckles. All at once she  stopped the bad habit before being half way finished, an image of  Nanoha flashing before her mind as she scolded her to stop doing it  before she got arthritis when she was older. The thought made her look  to a small picture frame on her desk; an image of Nanoha and herself  laughing together. With a groan she turned the picture away from her  field of view, having sudden bad feelings for having snapped at her  about everything. “Bardiche,” She called to her device. “Work mode,  bring up today’s schedule and organize files to be sorted  through…please.” She added as an afterthought, also realizing that she  hadn’t been too polite with anyone the last day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly the hours  ticked by as she worked, breaking apart all the files of the past week  and the new folders of recruits just transferred to her section.  Although she wouldn’t be directly involved with the new people, she was  still technically in charge of the people who were in charge of them  and as such, she had to not only watch over them, but make sure their  superiors did their job as well. A knock on her door made her wave her  hand to move some of the several displays around herself and bid the  person to enter. “Good morning, Fate-sempai.” The woman greeted her,  saluting. “I’m sorry, but the deadline for the progress report was  pushed up to today.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just my luck.” Fate rubbed the bridge of her nose. “Thank you Cary-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  here,” The woman places a cup of coffee on her desk. “I noticed you  didn’t have your normal thermos with you so I made you a cup.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” Fate smiled at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did your better half not make you any this morning?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, she was asleep because I kept her up all night tossing and turning.” Fate sighed out. “…I’ve been a real bitch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll take my leave here,” She saluted again, not wanting to touch that conversation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Several hours passed by the woman, each one making her more and more frustrated by the amount of work she had to catch up on. ‘<em>Hayate-chan  needs to get her butt in gear and get us some more office personnel; I  won’t be able to handle all of this. I’m an enforcer, not a desk junkie…</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lunch  time, Fate-sempai,” a male by the name of Syaoran poked his head into  her office. “Come on, you’ve been in there non-stop. Stretch your legs  out some.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not very hungry,” Fate replied eyes still on the  displays as she typed rapidly. “Go ahead; I got the phones while you’re  out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Right then.” Syaoran nodded to himself and walked off, leaving her alone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Time  dragged by slowly again for the woman, only stopping around three to  walk to the roof of the building to talk with the mechanics who were  working on her car. “We’re sorry, ma’am,” The man told her again from  the video display in the air. “But I was told specifically by the  higher ups that there was a budget, and your customized flare on your  car surpasses it. All I can do is fix your body work, everything else  will have to be ordered and we need a credit card to bill for it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, <em>okay</em>!” Fate sighed for the hundredth time. “Charge it to my personal account. Anything else?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  ma’am.” The man gave her an apologetic look. “Sorry Fate-san, you’re  our best customer but I can only stretch things so far…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  fine…Hayate-chan can’t always bend over backwards for me, I’m sure she  got yelled at for it or this wouldn’t have happened… She’s just too  nice to say anything.” The two looked at each other a moment before  nodding and cutting off the video call. The blond instantly brought her  hands to her eyes and rubbed. “Someone just <em>shoot</em> me so this damned day will be <em>over with</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Walking  back inside the woman made her way back down to her floor via the glass  elevator. The doors opened with a small ding and she walked into the  large office space slowly. After a few steps she noticed suddenly that  everyone was looking at her and smiling. She gave one of her workers an  inquisitive glance, but it was returned with a giggle. ‘<em>What’s going on?</em>’  She wondered to herself lightly, walking a little faster when people  started going out of their way to look at her or grin broadly. Upon  reaching her office she stopped in her tracks all at once. Though her  open door and glass wall she saw a large bouquet of mixed flowers as  well as a rather giant stuffed bear. Her hand went to her mouth in  shock, standing in the same spot for a few moments before she realized  that she could go into her office and look at them instead of standing  outside of it and staring. Several of her friends all scuffled over to  the doorway to watch the surprised girl look down at her gifts.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  vase held several different kinds of flowers, each one being a  different color. Her mind counted them absently, seeing about a dozen  in all. After smelling them her eyes turned to the large bear sitting  beside the vase. It had a cute happy look on its face and came complete  with a card in its lap. Picking it up, she opened the envelope and read  the front. “For someone as special as you are,” She read aloud for the  people watching. “There is only one thing I can say…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate opened the card, being greeted instantly by Nanoha’s pre-recorded voice: “Fate-chan, I loooooooooooove you!!!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  blond quickly closed the card, blushing horribly as everyone suddenly  started wolf whistling at her and cheering. “Go back to work!” She  stomped her foot, trying to look serious but the hot blush across her  face ruined the ‘boss look’ she was going for. “Go on, go!” She tried  again, this time making them giggle to themselves and disperse. She  still got teasing glances through her window so after a few moments she  shut her door and closed the blinds so no one could see in. Now alone  she walked over to her desk and picked up the teddy bear to observe it  again. A few moments passed before she cuddled it to her chest and  smiled brightly. ‘<em>This is the best day I’ve ever had,</em>’ she thought happily.</span></p>

“Tia?” Subaru asked softly after the girl finished rubbing the lotion on her back to help the bruises go away faster.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  is it?” The orange-ish red haired girl replied softly, fanning the back  in front of her to try and make the cream dry on her skin faster.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you… want to talk about it now?” Her voice was clearly a little worried, eyes still facing forward.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia  let out a small sigh. “I suppose we have to sooner or later, huh?” She  moved to sit next to the girl on her bed. “Um…you start.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  make it sound easy,” Subaru smiled despite the sudden seriousness of  the conversation. “I’ve… gone over what I was going to say a million  times but now that you’re here with me I can’t remember any of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let me just say… I’m sorry, for being so cold to you afterwards.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve  already apologized for that,” Subaru whispered. Silence hung over them  for a moment before she spoke again. “I understand you’re don’t like  girls. You don’t have to worry; I won’t hit on you again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So,” She closed her eyes. “Please don’t avoid me if there is a problem, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I…” She looked over at her friend. “The truth is…I’m unsure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Unsure?” The blue haired girl paused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t like girls… but for some reason I like you.” Tia took a steadying breath. “I can’t explain it so please don’t ask.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean, ‘like’ me like me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia felt her lips turn up in an amused smile. “For lack of a better way of putting it, yes, I like you like you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  like you too,” Subaru replied a little more easily than her friend.  “Well, I think I’m in love with you, but you already knew that didn’t  you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, um…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not ready for this kind of thing,” Tia admitted before her friend could continue. “Can we…take it really slow?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes!” the outbreak made Tia pull back in shock. “Oh, sorry. I didn’t mean to shout.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Idiot,” Although it was an insult, the way Tia said it made it sound as an endearment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll…”  Subaru slowly reached over and took her friend’s hand, interlacing  their fingers. “Keep it to ourselves for right now, until you’re ready.  Would that make you feel better?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry,” Tia allowed  herself to bring Subaru’s hand to her mouth and kiss her fingers. “For  being so uncertain about something that means so much to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t say that,” She blushed lightly. “If I can just hold your hand… I can wait until you’re ready to take the next step.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru…” Tia looked over at her a moment, cheeks darkening. “Mind if I hug you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  don’t squeeze too hard,” Subaru teased her, letting go of her hand in  favor of wrapping her arms around her friend. “So…Are you my  girlfriend?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Yes.” Tia closed her eyes, amazed at how she felt more relieved than scared after saying those words. “I’m your girlfriend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia… Thank you.” Subaru gave her another gentle squeeze before pulling back and smiling.</span></p>

Fate  slowly opened the door to her apartment and shut it behind herself as  quietly as she could. The clock on the wall displayed that it was  already eleven at night, way past their normal bedtime. “Welcome home,”  Nanoha called to her from the upstairs. She was leaning against the  railing of their bedroom with a sleepy grin on her face. “Got my  present I see? Hope I didn’t distract you too much?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not at all,”  Fate replied happily, setting the flowers on the living room table and  carrying her bear upstairs. “But you shouldn’t have waited on me;  you’re probably sleepy from last night.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Its okay, we were given  tomorrow off so we could rest for a mission. There are supposed to be  some lost logia signals in the city. We are going to investigate it in  case there is a relic among them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Fate slid off her uniform jacket with Nanoha’s help. “I’m really sorry about last night; I was way out of line.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  worry, we all have bad days.” Nanoha smiled to herself, allowing her  arms to reach under her girlfriend’s and undo the buttons on the shirt  for her. “You’re the sweetest, nicest girl I know so I figured you were  just really stressed out so I sent you a gift to try and calm you down  some so you won’t go crazy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And it worked wonders.” Fate  slipped out of her shirt and smiled when her girlfriend unbuttoned her  skirt and slid the small zipper down. “I don’t deserve you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not much,” She replied lightly, placing a kiss on the girl’s neck. “Just your standard girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,  whatever.” Fate turned, letting her skirt drop to the ground, and  hugged her friend. “You are a beautiful little vixen who has me wrapped  around her little finger.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Am I really beautiful?” She wondered in the hug. Fate nodded against her, making her smile. “Even if I have small breast?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I like you small breast,” The blond teased her happily. “Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just wondering,” She replied cutely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let’s  get some sleep, tomorrow is going to be busy.” The words were finished  up with a quick scooping up of the brown haired girl. Fate carried her  over to the bed and sat her down onto it gently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are we doing tomorrow?” She pondered, looking up at her as she changed for bed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  just told you, we’re going to get ‘busy’.” Fate winked at her. “It’s  been almost six days now and I’m feeling restless.” She crawled into  bed next to Nanoha and kissed her forehead. “And I <em>know</em> you must be frustrated by now, my little bunny.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who says I’m frustrated?” Nanoha stuck out her tongue. “I’m just fine, thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  looked at her a moment, wondering who this person was and what she did  with Nanoha. After staring at her smiling face for a few moments she  gasped out. “You didn’t run my batteries out again did you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Busted,” Nanoha stuck out her tongue.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou, I <em>just</em> put those in there!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll buy you some more, I promise!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Buy you <em>own</em>, jeez!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I <em>like</em> yours!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou,  come here you!” Fate grabbed her friend and tickled her sides, making  the girl squeal out happily. The two wrestled around on the bed for a  moment before finally stopping to take a break and get some more air  into their systems. After a moment Fate looked over at her girlfriend  and smiled fondly at her. “Nanoha-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, Kitten?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love you. Lots.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  smiled happily. “Thank you. I love you too. Lots and lots.” She curled  up against Fate contently after finally cutting off the reading light  she had on.</span></p>

Author’s  Notes: Slightly shorter chapter than my last one, but I realized that  if I tried to put everything all together then I would have a chapter  that’s nearly 20,000 words long…. And that would get a little boring  after a while. So here is a fluffy chapter for you. Next one will be a  little more serious than this one and will also have some more action.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  some of you know, I don’t like to use Japanese words in my story when I  can avoid it. I do, however, really like honorifics, as they can tell  things that just can’t be translated into English. An example is Nanoha  going from “Caro-san” to “Caro-chan.”, showing that they are a little  closer to each other. For anyone who doesn’t know, “-sempai” is used to  address someone respectfully who is an upperclassman. It basically is a  way to show respect to people who have been at a place longer than you  have, or know more than you do, or are simply more skilled than you.  “-sensei” can be used to either refer to an actual teacher, or to a  doctor. In Shamal’s case, it’s obviously referring to her medical  status. Also right now, I would like to mention a less used honorific  that will be coming up in the next chapter: “-hime”.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hime”  translates to “Princess”, and is used when referring to someone who is  in position to the throne. Using it as an honorific, such as  “Caro-hime” can literally be translated as “Princess Caro”. I think  that using it as an honorific would be best since I don’t use “Mr.” and  “Mrs.” In this story. I’m sorry for any confusion honorifics can cause,  but that’s just my style of writing.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Next chapter:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha:  It was my worst fear come to life; feeling my own consciousness being  ripped from my very being. I couldn’t move my body, but I still could  see everything that was happening.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate: Nanoha was engulfed in  the yellow flames, screaming out my name in terror. I could do nothing  to help her, and her eyes lost the depth that made me fall in love with  them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha: No! I don’t want to be like this! I don’t want to hurt anyone ever again! End this, Fate!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate: I can't do it! I won’t hurt you Nanoha!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">????:  Nanoha is no more, only I remain.</span></p>
