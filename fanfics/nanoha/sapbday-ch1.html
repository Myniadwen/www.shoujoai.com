<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  awoke slowly as the sunlight from the window finally reached my side  of the bed. For some reason there was this <em>spot</em> on my pillow  that always had the morning light hit it to wake me up. Amazingly no  matter where I was on the bed I always seemed to be <em>right</em> there when the time came to awake me. It was for this reason that I  rather liked the sun; it was a reliable alarm clock. Vivio moved  against me lightly as she clutched at my shirt. With a smile I moved  her hand from myself and crawled over her carefully so I could reach  Fate. After double checking to make sure the little one was still  asleep I went about waking up my friend. &quot;Fate-chan,&quot; I  smiled when she stirred lightly. &quot;Fate-chaaaaaan.&quot; Moving  to straddle her waist I started rubbing her shoulders.  &quot;Faaaaaaate-chan?&quot; Finally she opened her eyes and looked  up at me only half focused. &quot;Happy birthday, Fate-chan.&quot;  Leaning over I pecked he forehead. After doing such I slid onto her  body and made myself comfortable, snuggling. &quot;I'm going to make  you breakfast but I'm still a little lazy.&quot; In response she  draped one arm over the small of my back and shifted to get more  comfortable. I loved it when she was sleepy, she was always so  snuggly.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By:</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  allowed herself to enjoy the rare moment of being cuddled for almost  five minutes before reluctantly re-straddling Fate's waist and  sitting up on her lap. With a face-splitting yawn she stretched out  and looked down at her friend again. The blond seemed to be slightly  more awake now and was gazing up at her happily. “Happy birthday  again,” She spoke down at her softly. In return the red eyed girl  smiled up to her and offered her hands, which were taken. “I love  your hands.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know,” Fate finally spoke back as she played with Nanoha's fingers.  The gesture was common now, having been seeded since they were only  twelve years old. Nanoha had said the words countless times now while  holding hands. Always the same, simple words. Once done, she would  always reply in kind: “Thank you.” The two touched their  fingertips together and idly flirted without saying anything else for  a moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mama...”  Vivio broke the silence then, reaching out to try and find one of her  guardians. “... Mama...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here,”  Nanoha scooped her up and laid her next to her friend's body. “Have  a Vivio.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  thank you.” She accepted the present and soon found herself  cuddled. “I'll keep this gift forever and ever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or  at least until she starts throwing a temper tantrum at which point  you'll tell her to go to Nanoha-mama?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  nailed it.” Fate gave her a gentle gaze.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm  going to make us breakfast. I told your work space you would be late  coming to work this morning already so take your time okay? You can  even sleep another half-hour or so if you would like to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  shook her head. “I'll be down shortly. Thanks for the extra time.”  The two met each other's eyes briefly before Nanoha leaned over to  give both Vivio and herself a kiss to the temple. When done the pony  tailed one waved lightly before going downstairs. '<em>How  odd,</em>'  Fate mused to herself. '<em>Nanoha  has always given me a present the very moment I woke up...Even when  we were living in separate houses she would sneak to my room to be  sure she was the absolute first to wish me a happy birthday.'</em> With a curious hum she let the fact slide by and proceeded to wake up  the child currently clinging to her. “Vivio. Vivio? Time to wake up  sweetheart.” When she met the multi colored eyes of her sleepy  'child' she couldn't help but touch her nose. “Good morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning,” Vivio rubbed  her eyes with both hands before letting out a loud yawn. “Happy  birthday.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You knew it was my birthday?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-mama  told me to be sure and say it as soon as I woke up,” She replied  honestly. “What's a 'birthday?'”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  helped Vivio out of the bed and proceeded to go about dressing her.  “Well, it's a very special day. Normally people celebrate the day  you were born by giving presents and eating lots of cake and ice  cream.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  were born today?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm  special,” Fate pet her head before going to her closet and picking  up one of her uniforms. “Fate-mama doesn't know what day she was  born on so Nanoha-mama gave me a birthday.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That's  today?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm.”  Fate started to button her undershirt. “Ten years ago, on that day  when we were on the bridge, I made my first friend. That is my  birthday.” Leaning over, Fate made sure Vivio's shirt was on  properly. “Come now, let's go see if Nanoha-mama has caught  anything on fire in the kitchen.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha's  voice floated up from downstairs with a loud “I can hear you!”  and a pout once they were in visible range. “I prepared extra hard  for you. I've been cooking Yuuno breakfast for the past week so I  would be sure I did it properly.” She broke a few more eggs into a  skillet and swirled the pan around. “Almost done, everything is  ready but the eggs and biscuits.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Western  style breakfast?” Fate looked impressed. “Biscuits too? Wow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They're  frozen,” Nanoha admitted to her while sticking out her tongue. “I  tried really hard but not even Yuuno would eat them anymore after the  third day...” Ignoring the amused look she continued to finish the  eggs. “You like them a little runny, right? We should probably make  sure Vivio's is fully cooked just in case though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-mama  sure thinks about the right things,” Fate cooed at her, leaning  over so she was looking over her shoulder. “Hm? Nanoha you went  stiff all of a sudden.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“N-nothing.”  The breath from her friend's mouth tickled her neck lightly. “Will  you get plates down please Fate-chan?” When the warm breath was  gone she instantly felt a shiver go down her spine. “Vivio, help  her set the table would you?” Her daughter replied happily and  trotted over to the blond, holding her hands up to reach for one of  the dishes.  “Do you have any specific plans for the day?”  She continued while they started getting everything ready to eat.  “Will you be late coming home or anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  that I know of.” Fate pondered the question a moment. “Lunch with  Signum and a meeting with Hayate later on but I don't think anything  else is planned, why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  wondering.” Nanoha looked over at the blonde and smile fondly.  “Hey, can I braid your hair?” As she sat the last batch of food  on the table she quickly went to stand behind her friend and start  finger combing the hair. “It won't take long, promise!” Although  she knew Fate got sleepy when her hair was played with it was a vital  part in her plan to have the hairstyle. Before any objection could be  made the hair was split into three parts and began to intertwine with  itself. “Sorry, can you eat while I'm doing this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  say after you start.” Fate began eating regardless, chewing slowly  to savor the taste. “Mmm... This is really good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you, I tried hard.” Vivio seemed to be enjoying her meal as  well, stumbling over the table manors she was learning in an attempt  not to be messy in her hurry to shove more into her mouth. “You  have to leave your hair braided today no matter what okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?”  Fate looked over her shoulder as best she could and gave Nanoha a  knowing glance. She knew it just had to have some type of connection  with Nanoha's birthday present to her and wasn't going to let up  until she knew for sure.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Mou.”  Nanoha pouted at her. “Stop trying to figure things out, it'll ruin  the surprise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  don't make it so obvious,” Fate countered her happily, eyes  shining. “Do I get my present now? You've made me wait hours!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  just woke up!” Nanoha put a hand on her hip and grinned at her  partner. She knew good and well she normally gave Fate her presents  just a few minutes after the stroke of midnight or at the very latest  waited until the sun started coming up. Having made breakfast she  successfully threw off the pattern and attempted to put Fate in a  confused state before surprising her but that was just shot out of  the air. “You spoil everything.” Nanoha poked the ruby eyed  girl's nose and smiled when Fate playfully nipped at her. “Down  girl. Good.  Stay.” She ruffled Fate's hair lightly as to not mess  up the completed braid and jogged lightly out of the room to fetch  the gift. “Close your eyes!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How  about I turn my back while putting Vivio's plate up?” Fate casually  called back as she did just that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  works too!” The voice floated down the house and was followed by  scuffling sounds from upstairs. Shortly after Nanoha flew over the  rail and glided silently over behind Fate. “Boo!” Her hands  grabbed Fate's shoulders and shook lightly, sending the blonde into a  small fit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kya!”  Fate turned and held a hand to her chest, panting. “Nanoha!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Happy  birthday!” Nanoha was smiling brightly, as if she didn't just give  her best friend a heart attack. “This is for you.” She held up a  type of flower that would resemble a rose back on Earth, only yellow  in color. “Do you know what this is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  yellow Mid-nan.” Fate replied easily, looking at the beautiful  flower. “Where in the world did you get one? They are ultra rare.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  called in a few favors,” Nanoha admitted easily with a smile. “Do  you know what it means?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Now  it was Fate's turn to smile. “Mm. One of the ancient goddesses gave  it to her best friend as a symbol of their connection. It's the  flower of friendship.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.”  Nanoha beamed at her. “You know a lot about flowers. Good, that  will make this go a lot easier.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?”  She blinked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing!”  Nanoha allowed Fate to smell the flower and look at it just a moment  more before Nanoha took it back and got behind her friend. “And now  for the finishing touch.” With a little work she threaded the stem  seamlessly into the braid so the flower was top center of the  hair-style.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  blushed lightly, knowing people were going to giggle at her when they  saw the cute flower in her hair. “Nanoha, that's embarrassing...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's  okay.” Nanoha protested happily while leaning over to kiss her  cheek. “It looks nice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Thank  you.” She embraced the fingers around her shoulders and leaned back  against Nanoha, careful not to crush her new flower. After enjoying  watching Vivio's attempts to clean off the table for a while Fate  finally pulled away from the hold and stepped forward. “I should go  ahead and get to work, I'm already pretty late. You're going to take  Vivio over to Hayate's later today right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah  Hayate needs her to get officially registered as a citizen and  resident of the base so she'll probably end up staying the night with  her.” Nanoha walked her to the door and allowed herself to be a  living brace while Fate put her heels on. “I'll be waiting for you  tonight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”  Fate grinned at her, making Nanoha scratch her cheek. If she had been  trying to not give away the fact that she was planning something, she  had failed. “Okay, I'll come home right after work.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,”  The two looked at each other a moment longer, cheeks lightly  coloring. “Would you... want a birthday hug before you go off?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  blonde's gaze softened, smile playing on her lips. “Mm, yes  please.” The two took a step towards each other and gave one last  embarrassed look before wrapping their arms around each other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have  a good day,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm  off then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  two held the hug a while longer before pulling away slowly. Nanoha's  cheeks colored a little more when she noticed that she had been on  her tiptoes in the hug. Fate's natural height advantage with heels  made her a full head length taller than her when barefooted. “Once  again, happy birthday.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you,” Fate slowly went through the door and closed it while keeping  her eye on Nanoha until she was completely blocked from view. '<em>For  some reason I feel really embarrassed... Nanoha was so...touchy  today.'</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  brown haired girl on the other side of the door smiled brightly to  herself, nodding as if confirming something. Turning, she smiled at  her adopted daughter and spoke cheerfully. “Vivio, would you like  to help Nanoha-mama give Fate-mama a present?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Present?”  Vivio tilted her head to the side curiously.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Happy  birthday Fate-chan!” Hayate smiled merrily while leaning against  the door leading into the main office building. “Nanoha-chan  distract you a little this morning?” She gave her friend a hug  followed by a birthday card.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  a little bit, yes.” The two walked into the building and were  greeted by the warmth of the heater. “Can I open this now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Go  ahead.” Hayate stopped and watched Fate restrain herself from  ripping open the letter, as she knew would have happened if they had  been alone, and instead observed Fate very maturely slide her finger  to break the seal. “I was going to give you the day off for your  birthday but I decided not to because it could be seen as favoritism  so instead I'm going to be making you lunch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  smiled brightly as she read the card and gave her friend another  tight hug. “Thank you, it's so sweet! Don't worry about anything,  you know I don't need to get gifts. Just having everyone near me is  enough.”  Despite her words she still slipped the gift card to her  favorite bookstore into her purse along with the card. “Lunch,  hmmm?” She thought about it. “I'm supposed to be-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't  worry.” Hayate waved it off. “I know your tradition of eating  with Signum on your birthday so I'll do it tomorrow.” She grinned  at Fate's embarrassed look. Signum was Fate's first real role-model  and the two had gotten along surprisingly well over the years; even  if there was a short phase where Fate tried to copy things that  Signum did. Fate would never admit it, still probably thinking she  covered herself so no one else noticed, but Hayate could still recall  all the times Signum had come home after being on a mission with Fate  and was torn between talking fondly about how the two got along or  demanding never to be placed with the blonde ever again. The memories  made her giggle lightly and had to cover her mouth to hide it from  the curious look she was getting. “Nothing, don't mind me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ohhhhh  kaaayyy...” Fate gave her another amused look before setting off to  walk to the elevator with her friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ooh,  a flower.” Hayate laughed at the sight. “Nanoha really made you  wear it huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  knew?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  Hayate smiled innocently, not trying to cover the fact that she was  blatantly lieing. “I'll see you a little later okay?” with a  small wave she said her goodbye to her friend when she stepped out on  her floor.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  blonde blushed instantly when she saw the banner above the door  leading to her office that proudly screamed out that it was her  birthday. Several of her co-workers were grinning at her and laughing  at her embarrassment, pointing and covering snickers while at the  same time greeting her. “Mou, you guys.” She tried to cover her  face but only got more giggling around her. “Everyone go to work,  you hear me? No more making fun of me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha  give you a spanking yet!?” Someone Fate couldn't see called out  from across the room, getting loud laughter from everyone else.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whoever  said that is getting a pay cut!” Fate declared playfully before  finally escaping to her office and away from her teasing office  space.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was around ten in the morning before the birthday girl got her next  treat on her special day. Outside her office people were suddenly  squealing over something cute and flocking around it. The red eyed  girl's curiosity perked and she too left her desk to see what it was.  Once close enough she heard the familiar sounds of Vivio's happy  laughter and shortly after saw her adopted daughter outright. The  little one was wearing a uniform that was an exact copy of hers,  complete with a black ribbon at the bottom of her hair. “Mama!”  Vivio noticed her and ran towards the woman quickly before hugging  her knees. “Hello!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello,”  Fate greeted back as she observed Vivio closer. “You look  adorable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hayate  made it for me!” Vivio informed her childishly. “Nanoha-mama said  it would be cute. Oh!” She reached into the miniature purse she was  carrying and pulled out a small plastic case that was poking out of  it. “Nanoha-mama said to give this to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  took the case and blinked at it. Inside was another rose, this one  Orange in color. '<em>Orange,</em>'  She thought to herself as she opened the case and took out the rose  to smell it. Soft and subtle, barely noticeable on it's own but still  enough to tickle her nose. '<em>Desire and fascination? Why  would Nanoha give me one like this? What does she want?</em>'  The question rolled over in her mind until the small girl waved a  hand in front of her clouded eyes. “Oh, I'm sorry sweetie, thank  you.” Fate put an arm around Vivio's bottom and hefted her into the  air to hold against her side and carry.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-mama  wanted me to put it in your hair.” Vivio continued as she was  carried into Fate's office.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Hey,”  Signum greeted casually as she walked through Fate's door while  rapping lightly against the frame with the back of her hand. “Is  the birthday girl having a nice day?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very,”  Fate greeted with a smile. Her hands quickly typed on the keyboards  to save her work before closing down and grabbing her purse. “You  should have seen Vivio this morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know,” Signum smiled in her own special way. “Nanoha came over  with her to pick up the outfit. Speaking of...” Signum produced a  single Mid-nan  seemingly from nowhere and held it up. “Here's number three for the  day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Number...”  Fate's eyes widened slightly as she put the pieces together. “She's  setting something up isn't she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,”  Signum confirmed for her as she allowed the blond to inspect the pink  flower.  “Turn around please.” Fate did as requested and Signum gently  weaved the stem into Fate's braid, adding the flower down the strands  and also fixing Vivio's attempt at doing so as well. Once down the  three floral accessories were in a straight line in the braid.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My  hair is becoming a flower garden,” Fate half whined half joked  while Signum worked. “It's embarrassing...” She closed her eyes,  feeling suddenly sleepy with the hands working her hair.  '<em>Pink...Happiness,  admiration, gentleness, 'trust me'...What is it Nanoha? You're  working up to something I know it... Friendship, desire, asking me to  believe in you...What is it you're trying to say?'</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  want to take them out?” Signum's voice shook her out from her  thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...No,”  Fate covered her face with both hands to hide her blush. “I don't  want to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  don't complain.” Signum patted Fate's shoulders to let her know she  was done before turning to go out the door. “Where do you want to  eat at today?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmm...The  Mexican place?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Didn't  you <em>just</em> eat there?” She gave the blonde a weird look.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please?”  One red eye closed and she stuck out her tongue. “I want to munch a  taco.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Looking  up from her work, Fate saw four people smiling at her from the office  door. The forwards all waved at her weakly, having just come from  training. “I don't suppose Nanoha has anything to do with the burnt  barrier jackets and wild messy hair does she?” Her words were  playful, knowing full well that her room mate probably gave them hell  today. “What can I do for you?” She added as an afterthought  while closing her monitors down. It was still a few minutes before  her normal quitting time but leaving a little early couldn't hurt...
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Happy  birthday!” They all sang out together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Congratulations  on turning twenty.” Subaru offered a card followed closely by Tia.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you,” Fate gave them a happy look before reading the cards in her  hands. “How sweet...” In a rare moment of disrespect to their  rankings she gave them each a hug and turned to the smaller members.  “Thanks for stopping by, it means a lot to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know,” Elio hugged his older sister tightly. “Oh, Nanoha-san  wanted us to give this to you...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here,”  Caro held up a Mid-nan and smiled knowingly. “She said to be  absolutely sure you got it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yellow?”  Fate pondered aloud as she observed it. “No wait, it has red  tips...” Her eyes gazed at the flower a moment longer while the  others seemed to be holding their breath. '<em>Yellow is friendship,  but the red tips make it...</em>' She  gaped loudly, hand clasping over her mouth. '<em>No... no  way...</em>' She heard Subaru trying  to hold back a happy squeal and was silenced by Tia's elbow in her  ribs. '<em>She means... Friendship but she desires more...for  me to trust her... she's falling in lo-...'</em> She looked at the group again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-san  is waiting,” Subaru offered lightly, revealing that they were all  in on it as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I-I  have to go.” Fate quickly hugged them all in turn one more time  before grabbing her purse off the desk and hurrying out the door and  into the hallway as quickly as she could without it making it look  like she was running. The cold air greeted her harshly at the door of  the office building and she jogged the rest of the way to the  residential area of section six. The doors slid open to her call and  the elevator ride was made slowly. The blonde, normally calm, found  herself hopping in place and nibbling her bottom lip as she waited  for people to board and exit on the way up the few short stories that  made up the building.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally  the door to her loft apartment was in sight but before her hand waved  over the scanner to open it she suddenly felt nervous.<em> 'What if I''m wrong?</em>' Her tongue  flashed out over her lower lip in a subconscious nervous reaction to  the thought. '<em>It would be a dream come true if she did mean  it like that but... Nanoha is a little scatter brained, maybe she  doesn't realize what the flowers are saying...but then</em><em>again</em>...' Slowly she  took a breath to steady herself and finally scanned her hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  door hissed open instantly. “I'm home Nano...ha?” Fate dropped  her purse. The lights were all completely off but the rooms were  illuminated in a soft candlelight. Starting a little ways into their  loft a trail of candles lead to the stairs, giving off enough light  to show the way she was meant to go and reveal that by each candle a  single red mid-nan laid by it. '<em>This can't be happening...</em>'  Fate slowly walked forward, not even taking her heels off, to the  first candle. Trembling fingers picked up the de-thorned flower and  held it to her eyes. '<em>Red... love... she loves... they're  red...</em>' Her mind stopped working  briefly while she followed the trail and picking up the flowers along  the way. '<em>Six...seven...</em>'  She stopped counting, seeing the last one on her nightstand up the  stairs along with an empty vase. '<em>Twelve counting the ones  I already got...</em>' As she walked  she noticed a small teddy bear on the bed complete with a card held  in it's lap.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Deciding  to place the flowers first before looking for Nanoha, Fate slowly  undid her braid and arranged them all in the vase. Moving back to the  bed she noticed several rose petals sprinkled around the sheets and  felt a hot blush creep up on her face. Her fingers stopped just a  moment when they touched the card but still plucked it from the teddy  bear and opened it up. Despite the darkness in the room the  candlelight still gave enough to allow her to make out the words  neatly written on it:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Turn  around and look down </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  card fell from her fingers at the same time as her hand once again  found it's way to her mouth to cover a gasp. Slowly, ever so slowly,  she turned around and allowed herself to look towards the floor.  Nanoha was before her, kneeled down and looking up at her with  shimmering eyes that reflected the glinting candle flame. “Fate,”  She began softly. The blonde choked on her air but still watched,  body shaking in anticipation, disbelief, and most of all an amount of  joy that she couldn't describe. “We've been together for so long.”  Nanoha continued as she brought up a small velvet box. Clicking it  open Fate gasped again at the sight. A small golden ring with  intertwining hearts and their birthstones looked up at her. “And I  know I'm a little slow sometimes but... I want you to know that I  love you. I really, really love you...So...” Reaching up she took  Fate's right hand and slid the ring over her finger. “Will you be  my girlfriend?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  red eyed girl didn't know what to do, what to say. Everything she had  ever wanted had just hit her head on and she didn't know how to deal  with it. Her knees gave out from under her, making her plop down on  the bed and stare at her friend with wide shocked eyes. Briefly she  looked back at the ring on her trembling hand still being embraced by  Nanoha's and then back to the blue eyes searching for an answer. She  was on her knees for her, petals everywhere, candles lighting their  room, the sweet smell on incense and flowers lingered around her, and  her hand was being held so very softly. Nanoha had finally granted  the wish she had silently asked for the past three birthdays. A tear  rolled down her cheek as she blinked, followed by another a few  seconds later.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“E-eh?”  Nanoha's look suddenly turned to panic. “Fa-Fate, please don't  cry!” The hand gripping the blonde's suddenly got tighter.  “D-didn't you want me to ask? I... I mean... oh please don't cry!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  shook her head quickly, pulling Nanoha forward and embracing her in a  hug. She couldn't find her words at the moment, voice lost in her  tight throat while she held her friend tighter. Another tear of joy  rolled down her cheek. The smell of Nanoha's hair invaded her nose,  body heat seeping into her as they embraced. The shock slowly started  to fade away and she realized that her friend was probably still  worried that she had done something wrong. “Yes,” Fate finally  whispered into Nanoha's hair as she tried to pull her almost  painfully closer. “Yes, yes I wanted it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha's  tense body relaxed all at once and soon hugged Fate back fully. “You  scared me,” She scolded softly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,”  Slowly the two pulled apart and touched foreheads. “I'm just...”  She sniffed lightly and Fate fought the urge to rub her nose. “So  happy right now...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good,”  Nanoha gently touched the blonde's cheek and caressed it lovingly.  “Fate...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes...?”  Her hand also went up to touch Nanoha, small glimmering bits of light  reflecting off the golden ring.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can  I kiss you?” Fate  didn't answer. Instead she simply nodded lightly and leaned forward.  Their lips met softly, almost not enough to be a real kiss. Instead  of ending there they tried again, this time finding each others lips  and pressing against them just enough to be felt. The two stayed like  that for an un known length of time, simply holding each other and  touching softly. “Happy birthday, Fate.” Nanoha whispered briefly  as they broke to take a small intake of air.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha...”  Fate slowly leaned back on the bed, taking her new girlfriend with  her, and gazed up into the clear eyes of the most important girl in  her life. “I love you too, Nanoha.” Their fingers slowly found  each other's and interlaced gently. Eyes closed against their will as  their lips touched again, breath playing lightly onto each other. The  candlelight burned softly around them, caressing their skin in a soft  light as the girls slowly leaned in for more kissing.</span></p>

Author's  notes: I know it's a standard &quot;Nanoha and Fate like each other and end  up together&quot; story... but darn it I like this one. I wanted it to be  sickingly cute and full of fluffy warm feelings instead of the more  serious works I've done lately. Also I'd like to give special mention  to more of the nameless Nanoha translation brigade. Narmi, Beddo9, and  Nirvaphreak ( in no particular order) for many translations, and Zoung  for providing most of the scans. Also all the people who prefer to stay  Anonymous, thanks to you as well.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As for this story, it will be  continued in the future to pick up where the girls left off in another  fanfic entitled &quot;Emerald Night&quot;.</span></p>
