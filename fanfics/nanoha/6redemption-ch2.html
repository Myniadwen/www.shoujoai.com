<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Moving down  the large office space, I weaved in and out of the many cubical working  areas. A few people were caught goofing off but quickly returned to  their job after a glare from me. Times like this made me realize just  how much easier it was to get around without the large mass of hair  following me everywhere. Although I didn't like to admit it, when I  rounded corners fast sometimes a stray hair would get caught on  something and be plucked from my head. I missed my hair but after the  few months that it has been gone I've come to accept it. At least now I  can blame Nanoha's hair for clogging the drain in the shower. The  thought made me giggle to myself and I shook my head with an amused  look. Finally I made my way to the elevator and took a floor down  before walking through a more hectic area than I had in the floor  above. Even though I didn't oversee this area at all, my rank still  made people focus heavily on their job when I walked past. Since this  floor was almost a mirror of mine, I quickly made my way to the main  office separated off form the others by glass. The in-panel blinds were  closed, forcing me to knock on the door and wait a moment before being  beckoned to enter. Syllabus, a man with long brown hair swept into a  ponytail, greeted me with a kind smile as I handed him the application  papers for the upcoming mage tests. The forwards, as well as Nanoha and  myself, were now officially registered to increase their rank in three  weeks.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By: Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia  concentrated hard, looking up at Nanoha with a determined expression.  Her teacher was upside down several feet above her with a hand reaching  down in an attempt to grab the training girl. “Come on,” Nanoha  encouraged her. “Focus Tia, you can do it!” The gun user was hovering  many feet off the ground, swaying lightly in an attempt to go farther  up into the air. “You're so close!” Their finger tips touched each  other's, making Tia's face break into an accomplished expression.  Immediately after, however, she swayed hard to the side and fell hard  to the ground below her. “Are you okay?” Nanoha landed and helped her  stand. “You lost your concentration and made your magic unbalanced.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know,” Tia rubbed her temples. “Is it always this nerve wracking? When  does it get so easy you can do it without even thinking?” She found two  small pills being offered to her and blinked when a bottle of water  also came into view. “Thank you,” She took the pills and swallowed them  down with the liquid. “Sorry about this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't be,” The  ponytailed woman laughed. “I shouldn't even be teaching you this until  you're double-A, so it's my fault you've been having these constant  headaches. It does get to the point where you can fly without even  thinking about it but it takes time and mentality. That's why Triple-A  and even S-classes have a lot of mages that can't fly. It takes a  special someone to be in the air force. Like I told you before, when I  learned it was because I didn't even have a choice. I either learned to  fly right then and there or I would probably die. Even still, my flying  was wobbly and whenever I took off I normally flew to the side a moment  before correcting myself. It wasn't until I took the three month primer  course before I could take off or land properly. You may not be cutting  flips yet, but you've already mastered form.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Will I be able to  use this for my mage ranking test or would it be better not to mention  it yet?” She drank heavily from the water bottle and exhaled once done.  “Ah, I feel refreshed already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha smiled at her and opened  her mouth to reply but a monitor appeared in front of her.  “Nanoha-chan!” Hayate's voice sounded scared. “I saw you flying!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was teaching Tia,” She defended herself. “And I'm on the training field, I have permission to fly here!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well... Well, for the next little bit I'm going to have to revoke that! For now on you can only fly in-doors.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha's  eyes went wide. “What!? Come on Hayate-chan, that's not fair! I didn't  do anything wrong, I've even stopped flying from my room to the  training field like you asked! Flying inside a building is pointless,  there's no air or clouds or anything!...Wait a second, you can't fly  inside buildings anyway, there's no where to go!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm sorry, but as your superior, I don't want you flying! People could see you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“People see me all the time, why would it matter now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate paused. “Th-that's not important! Anyway, no more flying, I mean it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  stayed silent a moment before looking away angrily. “Fine. I  understand, ma'am.” The brown haired girl looked hurt at the tone,  sadly turning her eyes before closing the communication. “Tia, I'm  canceling our extra training for this afternoon, I think I might hurt  you if I don't take a breather before practice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But... isn't she your childhood friend? Can't you talk to her about this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  teacher sighed out. “Tia, friendship is very important, but it has no  place in military ranks. Hayate-chan goes out of her way for me all the  time, just as I go out of my way for her. However, when all is said and  done, she is my superior and I must do as she says. If I don't the  higher ups will notice, and say that her leadership isn't up to snuff  and that I was a bad influence on my students. At the end of the day  we're friends, so I can be miffed at her if I want to; better than  causing a scene.” Nanoha looked down at her watch. “Fate should be  eating lunch about right now, I wonder if she's at the apartment...  Anyway, have you thought about your future?” With a slight push she  made Tia start walking with her towards the rest of the base from their  little island. “About what style of combat you want to master?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  have,” She nodded. “But I'm not sure just yet. Each one has their  advantages and disadvantages...” Looking up, she grinned at Nanoha. “I  can see why Subaru idolizes you so much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh I don't know, she's  been spending a lot more time with Vita-chan ever since I started  giving you privet lessons. Speaking of Subaru, I noticed you two have  been looking at each other a lot the past two days?” Nanoha smirked at  Tia and nudged her. “I think my students are finally getting a little  'training' going on in their bedroom, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“N-Nanoha-san!” Tia's face grew warmer at the words. “Th-that's private! How did you know!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  besides you just telling me,” She gave her student a moment to kick  herself. “I can just tell. I acted the same way after Fate and I had  our first time. Ahhh, what a night.” She looked up at the sky as she  remembered it. “Candles, soft music, rose petals on the bed...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“R-really!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yup. Was the picture perfect night... at least until morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What happened then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  didn't blow out the candles and we had melted wax everywhere, as well  as rose petals all in the covers and floor. Whatever we didn't find  dried up and crumbled so we had to change the sheets on the bed every  day almost because of it. Not to mention the sheets were stained red  from our sweat and petals being rubbed against them. But oh <em>man</em> was it worth it. She does this <em>thing</em> with her tongue that just-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Enough!”  Tia almost screamed, making Nanoha cover her mouth when she realized  what exactly she had just said. “Whoa, you really don't know when to  stop do you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry.” Nanoha bowed lightly, embarrassed. The two  split up at the elevator then, leaving Nanoha alone to walk into her  apartment. She found Fate on the couch with her arms crossed, glaring  at the T.V screen. From the frown on her face and body position, Nanoha  could tell that her fiancée was in a bad mood. To counter this, she  straightened up her own boots for once and walked upstairs to their  bedroom, grabbing some lotion. Once back downstairs she sat next to  Fate and reached over, unbuttoning her shirt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha, I'm <em>really</em> not in the mood for-” A finger touched her lips, making her stop protesting.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Once  she had taken off the top half of her lover's clothes, she smiled  fondly at her. “On your stomach.” Fate did as she was told and laid  down on the couch. Moments later her hair was moved to the side and  warm wet hands were placed on her back, massaging. “What happened  Honey? Not hungry today?” Her fingers worked the warming lotion into  the blonde's skin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hayate,” The tone was obviously a little  harsh at the word. “Forbade me to drive my car into the city for some  reason. Instead I was grounded to base indefinitely to oversee the new  police force coming to train here. My whole schedule is messed up, and  instead of patrolling and some office work, I have to play 'boss' to a  bunch of D and C ranked mages.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh? But that was supposed to be  my job, I'm the instructor.” Nanoha paused her rubbing momentarily but  picked back up again when Fate frowned at what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know, it doesn't make any sense. I don't know the first thing about  training people. She said I just had to show up to ensure they were  learning the basics of being good police men and how to fight in  crowded areas and the like. I wouldn't mind so much if they were going  into the military but these are only the police transfers. I know we're  here for public safety and all but I fail to see the point of me being  there. And why did she ground me to the base? I didn't even do  anything...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She grounded me as well,” Nanoha spoke during a  silent spot. “Quite literally; I'm forbidden to fly anywhere, even on  the training field. I have no idea how I'm going to teach Tia anymore,  maybe I should just focus on her weapon training and let Vita handle  Subaru and the other three lightning members...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is so  weird...” Fate looked over her shoulder at her. “Did we do something to  merit this? Maybe she's just nervous after we almost died on our last  mission? It would make sense, trying to protect us.” Her face fell  against her pillow and she talked into it. “But grounding us like  this... How am I supposed to buy groceries if I can't leave the base?  Our on board grocery store sucks and our butcher and fish mongers are  in town... Augh, Let's talk to her later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, let's drop it  until then.” Her hands continued to rub the smooth skin, calming them  both down. After attacking the red eyed girl's neck with the warm  lotion and rubbing she started to hum slightly. “Fate?” She asked  softly with a smile. Her lover had her eyes closed, breathing steadily.  Every now and then a soft hum would come from her, Fate's own version  of snoring. Having to repress a giggle, Nanoha slowly moved on top of  her. With a small beckoning on her shoulder she managed to make Fate  scoot to the edge of the couch and get on her side. With just enough  room to squeeze down between them, Nanoha got behind her and pulled the  blanket down to cover their bodies. “A little nap never hurt anyone,”  She thought aloud, rubbing Fate's stomach until her hands was grasped  lazily and held onto.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Hayate  blinked when the screen of the training field came up at her desk.  “Oi,” Vita greeted her casually while tapping her hammer on her  shoulder. “Did Nanoha say anything about missing tonight's practice? I  thought Fate was going to help her train this time around.” The brown  haired girl started at the screen blankly for a few seconds without  responding. “Hayate? Something wrong?” The little one blinked when her  friend turned to look at Yuuno.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They're in their room,” He spoke after a quick scan. “I'll go check on them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm  coming,” Hayate hopped out of her chair. “Vita, I'm going to get them  now, keep up the good work okay?” She got a small hum and the monitor  cut off. “Don't think they're hurt or anything do you?” They tried to  walk down the halls as fast as they could without making people wonder  what their hurry was. “You would have sensed any magic being used  right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Should have yes. It's not like them to just not show up  without contacting someone. Come to think of it, it's uncommon for them  to miss work period. Have they ever missed a day?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only when I  give them time off, and even then they still work. Since I let them  take Firesday off they never miss any other day.” The two made their  way across the cold field, the setting sun glowing in the background.  “Speaking of days, notice how short they are? Really annoying, I need  to budget some more lights around here.” The small talk eased both  their nerves a moment as they rode the elevator up to the sixth floor.  Once there they both hurried over to the door and opened it using  Hayate's rank. “Nanoha-chan? Fate-chan?” She called out instantly,  looking around. A groan greeted her and the pair went to the couch,  seeing Nanoha slowly sitting up and looking at them sleepily.  “Nanoha-chan, were you <em>asleep</em>?” The girl blinked lightly,  muttering something about the time. “It's almost four-thirty! You were  supposed to be at the training field half an hour ago! You have any  idea how worried we were? We thought something happened to you two!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?” Fate finally woke up at Hayate's outburst and sat up slowly, letting the covers fall. “What's going on?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh please tell me you two weren't sleeping after sex?” Hayate face-palmed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  looked down and realized she was topless. To remedy this she simply  held the covers to her chin. “Wha? No, She rubbed my back and I fell  asleep.” turning to sit properly she rubbed her eyes. “I'm sorry, we  didn't set an alarm, we'll be right there.” She was about to bring up  what had put them in the situation in the first place but she noticed  Yuuno with her as well. “We need to talk later okay Hayate?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure.”  She just seemed relieved more than upset right now. “Wake up and get to  the training field please, Vita is handling it all right now.” Nanoha  stood up and Fate reached down to pick up her bra to put on. “Come on  Yuuno-kun, let's go back.” She looked up at him and noticed that his  eyes were in the girl's general direction. Looking back, she saw Fate  sluggishly trying to clasp her bra to cover herself. A new feeling ran  through the girl's body, making her grab Yuuno's arm and literally pull  him out of the room. “Come <em>on</em> I said!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hayate, hey, ow,  that hurts. What's up with you?” He pulled his arm back and rubbed the  spot that was grabbed. “I wanted to say something to them.” despite his  complaint he still walked beside her back to the elevator.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More like stare at Fate-chan,” She huffed at him, crossing her arms and looking away. “You looked at her breasts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well she <em>was</em> kind of topless in case you didn't notice.” He sounded rather offended.  “Not that it matters, I've walked in on them countless times in the  past. I've seen Nanoha naked ever since I was nine, and Fate too most  of the time, they're like my sisters! I wouldn't think twice about it  now even if they were fully naked in the shower making like bunnies!  Come to think of it, I have been in that situation...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you can see their breasts because you're their childhood friend?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She didn't exactly seem to mind did she? Proof right there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well I'm your childhood friend and you never look at <em>my</em> breasts!” She protested loudly, glaring at him. The elevator went  silent as the two looked at each other. Hayate's face slowly colored  when she realized what she had just obviously complained about. When  the doors opened she quickly left, walking as fast as she could to get  away from him. '<em>Oh my god, what is wrong with me!?</em>' She had to stop at the door to allow several new policemen entrance to the mess hall. '<em>Why on earth would I want him to look at me!? He's my best friend!</em>' The delay gave the male enough time to catch up and simply stand beside her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  cold air greeted them harshly when they stepped outside, the wind  flaring out Yuuno's long ponytail. Hayate shivered, holding her arms in  an attempt to stay warm. “Here,” He placed his jacket over the girl's  shoulders. “You should wear stockings or something, you'll catch a cold  if you don't keep warm.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate reluctantly accepted the warm  blazer and held it tight in front of her, pleased that it went to her  knees to cover much more than her miniskirt did. “Stockings huh...?”  She looked over and up at him just as a red screen flared to life  flashing Alert at them. The two started at the screen for a full three  seconds before turning to run the rest of the way to the building.  “What's the situation?” Once close enough, both of them leaped into the  air and flew up the few stories into the large landing area that was  connected to the mission room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Several unidentified mages,” Shari told them immediately. “Causing havoc downtown, not far from the bridge leading to the base.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are their goals?” Yuuno stood next to Hayate's chair and observed the monitors giving them feed. “Logia? Relic? Money?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They  seem to just be destroying things, sir.” another operative revealed.  “The local police have been pushed back and the area is being evacuated  as we speak. The only demand so far was for 'a good challenge' as they  put it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate bit her thumbnail, eyes glancing over towards Yuuno. '<em>These don't seem like your average misfits...</em>' Her words flew into his heart telepathically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">'<em>The  U.F.Q is probably behind this in an attempt to lure us out into the  open or to weaken out base defenses enough to launch a real attack.  Regardless we can't rush into this carelessly.</em>' His eyes looked  over to the forwards as they ran into the room as well as Nanoha and  Fate. “Nanoha, how are the forwards in terms of solo operating?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just fine, they have been separated several times before?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate caught on to what was being said. “I want them to handle this by themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate stepped forward. “Wait, we can't just send them alone! They're still privates!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'll go with them,” Signum stated, catching Hayate's eyes. Vita, come with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With  a nod, Hayate gave the command. “Forwards, scramble to the helicopter.  Vice will fly you there. Signum, Vita, stay on board in case any more  enemy signal come up. Tia, you will lead this mission.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma'am!” They all saluted except for the gunslinger, who was looking over in terror at Nanoha.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Move  out!” Hayate shouted, making them all run out of the room.  “Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan, please stay here. If anything happens we'll be  ready for it.” The two girls gave her a nasty look before turning and  walking over to the monitors to start observing everyone as they  reached the heli-pad. '<em>They're pissed,</em>' Hayate spoke mentally to Yuuno, looking down. '<em>But  I'd rather them be mad at me for a little while if it means they will  stay safe... I can't handle something like last time again...</em>' She felt a hand on her shoulder and reached back to place hers on top of it in an attempt to gain some confidence.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Tia  swallowed nervously, looking at the four people and the single dragon  who were gazing at her with expectant eyes. “Okay,” She spoke up  finally and got the attention of Vita and Signum as well. “Suba...Star  Three, You will deploy first with your wing road. Lightning Three,  Lightning Five, you two will follow Subaru. Lightning four, fly your  dragon and cover from the air. I will follow last and provide cover  fire until we land. From there, Lightning Three and Five, you take the  west flank and proceed north. Lightning Five, provide long distance  offensive spells. Lightning Four, keep the support from the air.” She  got saluted to show everyone understood. “Our first priority is to  protect any civilians. Secondary we are to take them hostage, avoid  fatal combat if possible. Now... Deploy!” Taking a cue from Hayate, she  threw out her arm for effect. Just as she had ordered, the group inside  left the aircraft in a fast orderly fashion. “Signum-san, Vita-san...  If for some reason I mess up, protect my team.” With those words she  jumped out as well, sliding down Subaru's wing road to the ground.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Running forward, She called forth her gun and weaved through the  crowded streets. Everyone had split apart smoothly to cover the grounds  as fast as possible, leaving Tia to meet up with the police foce. '<em>Stars Three, engaged!'</em> Subaru's voice floated through the open communication device in her ear. '<em>Lightning Three, engaged!</em>'  Elio updated his status followed shortly by Lutecia. A large shadow  flew over her while running, Caro's dragon circling the sky as she gave  her support. The police line was close now, only hindered by the stupid  by-standards who were trying to see what was happening despite gunfire  and explosions. When close enough she plowed through them mercilessly,  even shoving to the side while making her path. Once finally at the  line she ducked under the tape and ran to one of the officers who  noticed her. “Private Tiana Lanster from 6th mobile division!” She  didn't have time to check his rank so saluted him anyway. “We're here  to help, my squad ahas already engaged two other areas. I need to speak  to the commander in charge, sir!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank goodness,” A new voice  made her turn and salute a policeman with several medals and badges on  his shirt. “Hayate-san never leaves us hanging. The situation, soldier,  is just as you can guess. We have cornered two men in the building  behind us. Unfortunately they have several hostages.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Their demands?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing yet, they have already killed one of my men sent in to negotiate. It seems as if they are waiting for something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see...” Tia took a deep breath. “I'm going in then.” with a flip of her  wrist she disabled Cross Mirage's first form and started walking to the  building. She felt the odd itch on her skin, knowing that a laser sight  had been placed on her but she kept walking anyway. When she was at the  door of the huge building she opened it slowly, being greeted with cool  air. Several people were on the ground, whimpering and crying while  looking at her with pleading eyes. Two men were in the middle, each  holding a mage staff. From the way they gripped it and stance they took  when faced with her they were relatively inexperienced. “I'm un-armed,”  she informed them, lifting her hands. “I'm here to talk. Take it easy  we can work something out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two people looked at each other  and laughed, deciding that this new girl would provide them with some  amusement. “Okay,” One of them began with a smirk. “Start talking.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Elio  dived to the ground to avoid the energy blast fired at him from the  side. Chunks of brick fell on top of him as he rolled but he didn't  stop his charge. Everything turned gray for just a moment, time slowing  down for only him as the burst of speed enveloped him from Caro. Rapid  fire magical bullets flew at him from all directions but none seemed to  hit him as he blurred around and ran up the side of a building. Sounds  of breaking concrete ripped up behind the main person shooting at him  before he lost his consciousness to the blunt end of the boy's spear.  Along with the man another turned, mouth dropping at the sight of a  young boy moving so fast he cracked the ground where his feet hit. He  too fell to a stunning stab of Strada only leaving one left. Elio  didn't seem scared of the man pointing a staff at his head, however.  Instead he only smirked at the single wasp that landed onto the hand of  the one opposing him. Within seconds the humming sound of wings flared  around him as they were engulfed in an insect swarm. Beating wings  soared around him, mixed with the screams of the poor man being stung.  When it was over Elio opened his eyes again, seeing the man on the  ground and Lutecia walking over towards them.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The explosion came out of no where, ripping the two apart and being  saved only by the sudden shield flashing to life around them. Landing,  Elio slid along the ground smoothly in his new armor. White metal  covered his barrier jacket, flashed in places with his signature red.  Dragon horns blessed his joints, complete with one on the helmet that  guarded his face. Moving his spear, he flared it to life as the new  enemy jumped down from wherever he had been hiding. “They sent kids to  deal with us?” He asked, voice dripping with disappointment. “My my,  and after we even manipulated this petty gang of reject mages to cause  enough destruction to get <em>them</em> here... Seems like we wasted our time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Put down your weapons and come quietly,” Lutecia spoke to him, voice quiet and calm.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Put  down our weapons?” The man stood, clad in a blueish black barrier  jacket that seemed to be more like battle armor than cloth. “My little  lady, you don't know who you are dealing with do you?” Looking to the  side, he noticed Elio shift into a battle stance. “Are you going to  attack us, boy?” He seemed more amused than threatened. “Come then,  have at us.” Turning back around, he looked up into the sky at the  dragon.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio snarled. “Sonic move!” Even the air slowed around  him as he sped up. Moving so fast he couldn't even breathe from the  burst enhanced by Caro's abilities. The pavement under his boots broke  from the force of the speed and power ripping through his veins. '<em>I'll end it on one slash,</em>'  His mind thought as the distance closed in between them. He could see  the man blink his eyes, seemingly moving in slow motion from the  ungodly movements he was moving at. Once close enough he reared back  his spear and started to slash, moving too quickly to even load a  cartridge.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The next moment Lutecia saw Elio fly away from the  enemy they were fighting and crash into the corner of a building,  breaking a large chunk out of it. His body landed roughly and slid  almost two feet before stopping. Very slowly blood started to leak  around him from the gash in his chest visible through the block of  armor now missing. Shocked, she looked at the man who was simply  holding up one arm, apparently having backhanded her partner without  even looking. “So slow,” He mused casually. “We have been observing  your moves for a few days now so they will not work on us. Caro  screamed from the air and the next moment he was walking through an  inferno of dragon flame. Raising a hand, he blasted Elio's body,  breaking more of the armor off of him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop it!” Lutecia finally  snapped. With gasp of air she formed her magical circle underneath her.  “What I desire, a-” She stopped speaking, suddenly finding herself  picked up by the neck. He had moved so fast not even the flames had  time to realize they could now burn the area he had been standing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Unhand her!” Caro yelled again, eyes narrowing as Lutecia was thrown away like a doll.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Guess  it wouldn't do to let you die without knowing who killed you,” He spoke  to them. “We are the Azure Flame,” raising a hand, Several blue balls  of fire started circling him. “You may also know us as “Tri-Edge”, the  head assassin of the U.F.Q.” Carelessly walking towards the summoner as  she pushed herself up, he formed the ball of heat into his hand. “Time  to burn.” Before he could move it, the fire in his hand froze so fast  it still had form before shattering into pieces. “Oh?” Looking to the  pink haired girl, he saw the dragon rider standing there shivering.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro's  body shook, eyes glaring hatefully at the man who had just hurt her  friends. The summoning circle was already formed, arctic temperatures  raging around her as ice blue scales formed into the shape of a  dragon's leg. “Shiva,” She finally spoke, eyes darkening due to the  spiteful Dragon's influence on her. “I want him alive,” She warned.  “But I don't care how much you have to hurt him to do it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Yes, Princess Caro Lu Rushie,</em>” Shiva's voice floated through her mind as she let out a thundering roar.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“No...It can't be!” Yuuno slammed his fist onto the console in front of him. “What is <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">he</span></em> doing there!?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha gasped out. “Did he say assassin!? U.F.Q!? What the heck is  going on here!?” She turned to her friends. “You... You know something  about this!?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pull them back!” Yuuno yelled at Hayate. “They're no match for him, they could die!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Signum, Vita!” Hayate contacted the others on site. “Get to the lightning members right now, they're in danger!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha shook her head. “I can't do this, I'm going!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  can't!” Yuuno yelled at her a little too late. The girl had already  flown out the window and was heading towards the city. “Son of a...”  Slowly he turned to the others. “Make sure she doesn't engage the Azure  Flame!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What's going <em>on</em> here!?” Fate demanded, finally having enough. “You have ten seconds to explain this before I leave as well!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Subaru  grunted as she was slammed against the brick siding of a house. The  battle she was in lead her into a residential area that was severely  playing to her disadvantage. Despite clearly over powering the weak  group of people she had been dispatched against her support was gone  when Caro had to land and fight. Alone against a group in a civilian  inhabited area she was greatly limited in her moves, forcing her to  take to more standard tactics to battle. With a quick thrust she  slammed her fist into the man's stomach. Normally she would have loaded  a cartridge to follow up with an energy blast but the sight of people  looking out their windows across the street forced her to simply punch  again, knocking him out. Holding her side, she skated to the middle of  the street and looked around. “Stars three,” She panted out, holding a  button on her ear piece to cut on her radio. “Northwest of your station  is clear. Six or seven people to be arrested.” She heard the response  while panting and was tempted to simply wait for the police to reach  her but she knew it wouldn't be that easy. “Tia,” She spoke again,  swapping the link to just her other Stars member. “Where are you, I'm  done cleaning up here.” Instead of getting a reply back through her  radio her girlfriend's voice lifted into her mind.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">'<em>Subaru, I'm in a tight spot. These guys are pushing me too far, get to the building by the main police force pronto!' </em>Tia  glared at the people in front of her, fingers itching to call forth her  guns and just start blasting. So far they had played games with her,  obviously trying to get a rise out of the girl. Finally it was to the  point where they were annoyed, their fun starting to die down. “So,”  Tia spoke to them, voice calm. “Let's start talking about resolving  this. If you'll put down your weapons we can peacefully end this and-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Get  arrested and be put in jail,” One of them snarled, pointing his staff  towards a group of people huddled together. “Okay, I think we stalled  long enough. Tri-Edge has surely gotten what he was after. Time for our  part of the deal to come in. You there,” He nodded towards Tia as he  started charging a blast on his staff. “We want a million in un marked  bills, small. Also want clear air space and a helicopter. All of our  friends must be let go as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pretty stout demands,” She  replied softly. “I'll have to speak with the people outside. I'll need  you to release some hostages as a sign of good will.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good  will?” The man laughed. “How about do as I say or they die? Here's a  preview.” he released the charge towards the screaming group and smiled  at the explosion and smoke it caused. Seconds ticked by as it cleared,  terrified yells ringing out from everyone else in the large room.  “What!?” His eyes narrowed at the orangish magical circle protecting  them. “That circle... You're no cop!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia formed both her guns  and trained them on the people. “I'm military, section six. Drop your  weapons, I have authority to harm you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Waste them!” The other  man started shooting blast after blast at the people around them, each  being nullified by Tia's well controlled counter measures. After a few  moments her superior speed became apparent and she could afford to make  one of her bullets fly towards them, shooting one of them directly  through his weak barrier and making him slide across the floor onto his  back. “Markus!” Taking no chances, the man grabbed a child no older  than four and placed the tip of his staff to her head. “Don't think you  can stop a blast this close can ya!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia stopped firing and kept her guns on him. “Put the child down. You don't have to do this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're a freaking mage!” He shouted back at her. “He didn't say anything about us dealing with you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who is 'he'?” she pondered, still calm.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh  you'll find out,” he laughed. “He'll come for us, we made a deal. You  stay right there, hands up or I'll kill her, don't think I won't!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia  slowly held up her hands. “Okay, calm down. We can talk through this.  Just sit her down and I'll place my weapons on the ground. You can walk  out of here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Put your guns down first!” He nodded towards the  ground. “Down!” The girl slowly bent over, keeping her eyes on him, and  placed both guns onto the floor. “Now turn around!” When she didn't do  it he pushed the staff closer on the crying girl, moving her head. “I  said turn around!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Doing as she was told, she looked up at the  mirror at the top corner of the room to keep an eye on him. “Okay, now  let the girl go. I will stay like this, you can run. No one has to be  hurt.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'll take her with me!” Quickly turning, he ran into a  back room and burst through a door, running up the stairs with the  child under one arm.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dammit!” Tia quickly turned, snatching up  her weapons and chasing after him. The stairs were climbed quickly,  avoiding shots fired down at her from the frantic thug. She heard the  rooftop door clang open and redoubled her speed, dancing up the stairs  almost faster than her feet could touch the steps. Once she reached the  top the man turned and pointed his staff at her, walking backwards.  “There's no where to go!” She told him, pointing her pistols. “Release  her and come quietly and you'll be given the right to a fair trial!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Go  to hell!” He started charging a shot and aiming at her, not noticing a  blue stream of magic fly up behind him. Subaru's wing road lashed  around behind the man, followed closely by the girl on skates. It  didn't take but a few seconds to take in the situation and glide over  to him, clocking the man upside the head with a powered punch from her  revolver knuckle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru! Just in time!” Tia ran over to them as  the man simply fell over from the hit. The small girl held captive  scrambled away and cried loudly towards her. “Good job!” Kneeling down,  she opened her arms to accept the crying girl. Before she could get  close enough, however, the man they thought to be unconscious released  his charged blast on the floor. The ceiling of the building ripped  apart, flaring out and making the little one literally sail through the  air and over the side of the building. The pigtailed girl didn't stop  to think about her actions before doing them. With a forceful jump she  leapt over the the side and fell off as well, reaching out for the  child. '<em>Fly!</em>' Her mind demanded as they plummeted to their death. '<em>FLY!</em>'  As the ground came closer she grit her teeth hard, forcing her power to  guide her. The last few seconds blurred together in her mind. Somehow  she manged to catch up to the girl, grabbing her hard against her  chest. The next thing she knew she was flying sideways a few feet off  the ground. Upon realizing this she righted herself and hovered several  moments before slowly descending.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia!” Subaru skated down her  road as the police force stormed the building and escorted the hostages  out. “You flew! You really flew!” Once she was close enough she cracked  her partner upside the head. “You scared three years off my life!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There she is!” Someone yelled out in the crowd, running over to them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Daddy!” The girl cried hard, letting go of Tia and clinging to the new man.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My  little girl...” He looked up at the two after making sure his daughter  was all right. “You saved her life...Thank you! Really.” He held his  child close. “Thank you so much... I'll never forget this, ever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru nudged the suddenly blushing girl. “Hey, you're a hero.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia's  eyes went wide. “No time for that!” Her hand went to her ear to press  the button. “Lightning, respond! Give me an update! ... Lightning!  LIGHTNING!” She looked at Subaru scared. “They're not answering.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Vita-chan!”  Nanoha flew in the air next to the girl and looked down in shock at the  unconscious Caro in her arms. “What happened to my baby!?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There is a mage down there,” Vita stated flatly, looking at the  ground. “Signum and I got there and they were already like this. He  didn't seem to want to kill them and just let us take them. Signum is  already in the helicopter, let's go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” Nanoha turned to the ground. “I'm going to talk with him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!”  Vita yelled at her. “Whoever he is, he can beat the three of them at  the same time. Two summoners! Don't mess with that unless you have to!  Let's get out of here and regroup!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And let him get away!?” She  glared hard, tears in her eyes. “I'm going to find out what caused this  senseless battle!” With no more words she flew to the ground, landing  softly and looking around. The area was almost completely destroyed,  frozen solid in blocks of ice in some places and on fire in others.  Kneeling, she picked up a chunk of purple and green armor. '<em>What's this...? Doesn't look like what Elio wears...</em>'</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha  Takamachi.” The voice made Nanoha stand. “You came after all. We guess  our gesture of good will didn't go unnoticed after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tri-Edge.” Nanoha glared at him. “You hurt them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  may call us Kite. We always give our real name to people of value.”  Walking into the light, he revealed himself fully. Black boots with  sparkling blue trim lead up to blue metal-ish type of armor covering  his legs. It went to his chest and spread out the rest of his body,  giving most of his barrier jacket a shine. Despite observing him, it  was almost as if the blue and black armor seemed to shift around him.  In all he looked like a new-age type of warrior knight, upgraded from  the middle ages on earth. “You turned down the offer we so generously  gave you, so now we were hired to make sure you couldn't be used  against us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have no idea what you're talking about,” She  growled at him. “But I am very displeased that you would hurt my  students like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We went easy on them.” Kite shrugged it off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who is this 'we' you are talking about? I don't see nor feel anyone else around.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We are we.” He pointed to himself. “Once we take care of you, Fate will be next.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha's  eyes narrowed, waking something deep inside of her. “I won't let you.”  Pointing Raising Heart at him, she fired rapidly. Kite brought out one  hand, slashing something that looked like a dagger several times. Each  stroke met one of Nanoha's magic bullets and forced them to ricochet  away from him into buildings nearby. After almost ten seconds of this  Nanoha finally got impatient and stopped. The last of the attacks were  deflected and he simply looked at her as if to ask if that was all she  had.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“With that kind of power, how do you expect to stay alive?”  Kite took a step forward. “I will make this as painless as I can. If  you want to pray, do so now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha yelled out loudly, reaching  behind her back and forming the blood red copy of Signum's sword.  Dashing forward she started slashing as fast as she could, once more  being deflected by the single dagger. Time and time again the clicking  sound of metal on metal rang around them. Her yell got louder,  re-doubling her efforts only to be denied again and again. Kite met her  eye and slashed his other dagger out, shooting her several feet back  and onto her back. “Ugh...” Slowly sitting up, she glared at the man  walking to her casually. Even though she wasn't touched from the strike  her barrier jacket was still ripped clean to reveal her stomach.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  needless death could have been avoided if you just would serve out  master. Then Fate, Yuuno, and Hayate wouldn't have to die as well. We  promise you they won't feel the pain. Is there a chance you will  reconsider so we won't have to kill them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't play games with  me!” She shouted at him. “You don't sound regretful at all, how can I  believe that!? You're enjoying this you sick bastard!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I don't want anyone to be hurt!</em>” Deep inside of Nanoha, a new voice surfaced. “<em>Use me!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  growled low in her throat, forming black mist over her barrier jacket  and staining it. “Come on... Come on!” Looking up, she glared at Kite  with glowing yellow eyes. “I'm... right... here!” The familiar echoing  surrounded her as the transformation to her third phase shift was  completed. “Skeeeeiiith!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Kite looked impressed. “So you  too possess an avatar. This makes things interesting.” readying his  dagger, he beckoned her with his free hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Skeith flew forward  so fast the air around them moved from the force of it. Her right hand  slashed out with her claws, getting deflected by the man's dagger.  Trying again, she moved her other hand forward. Kite's hand blurred  with speed, countering both hands with his one. Sparks started flying  around them as they clashed; Skeith slashing both hands as fast as she  could and Kite deflecting them on his own. Yelling in frustration, the  female leapt back, calling forth Raising Heart. Despite her years of  experience she still couldn't see the move that came next. Kite was  immediately in front of her, hand gripping her face. The next moment  she found herself skidding across the ground in pain. “Ahn...” She  slowly pushed herself up, yellow claws scratching the ground while  despretily trying to remember how to stand.. “What... are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We are we,” He replied as he did before. “Die.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!”  Bringing up her hand, three orange triangular strips flared to life.  Spreading out, several green and red octagons appeared between them as  her final attack was charged. “Data Drain!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He move hit Kite  solid in the chest, knocking him back a few feet. At first he yelled  out but it soon turned to laughter. “Stop it! It tickles!” Slashing his  hand, he destroyed the energy stream going into him and smiled  sickeningly at the shocked female. “My silly girl,” he taunted. “<em>This</em> is how it's done.” Bringing up his right hand, orange strips began to  glow around his arm, spinning out and jumping into eight lines. Each  one moved away from his arm and formed a type of shield in front of  him. Between them flared green, completely filling with the same  colored octagons. “Data,” He met Skeith's scared eyes. “Drain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Pain.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was everything, everywhere. She knew she was screaming but it hurt too  much to hear, hurt too much to see. It was as if her body was being  torn apart from the inside out, everything being sucked from her bones.  A raging inferno filled her chest, consuming her air and cutting off  what was left of her pain filled scream. For the first time in her life  she wished to just die, to be away from the agony. She felt part of  herself be torn from her, insides crack from the force and skin tear as  a result. Just as soon as it began, it stopped. Slowly she fell to her  knees and looked lifelessly at Kite as she fell forward, laying in a  pool of her own blood. “One down,” She heard before the blissful  blackness took over her. “Three to go.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Hayate: What happened to her!? What was that!?
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno: Her own move was used against her, but his was different... Perfected.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate: Assassin sent to kill us!? Why didn't you say anything!?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shamal:  The lightning members will be fine, they weren't hurt anywhere vital.  It was almost as if he purposely tried to avoid killing them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru: And Nanoha?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shamal: Her Jewel seed seemed to shift in her body; it caused a lot of damage.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia: Next time on Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha: Redemption, “The Truth Behind Truth.”</span></p>
