<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My side hurt  as my lungs expanded, trying to keep sufficient air in them while I  skated across the sidewalk in my battle gear. How dare they do this to  me? I know I was hurt, but still! My eyes narrowed as the building with  the helipad on top came close enough for me to form my wing road. The  trip up the several stories forced me to loop my road a few times so  the angle of accent wouldn’t make me actually slide backwards back down  it. When the top came to my view I felt a certain amount of relief wash  over me when the people I was after were still standing outside of the  helicopter. My appearance shocked everyone but Tia, who just frowned at  me. My wheels touched the roof and my blue road vanished, allowing me  to gently glide over to my captain and instructor. Saluting them, I  spoke up. “Private second class Subaru reporting for duty, ma’am!”</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By: Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru,  there is a reason you weren’t briefed on this mission,” Nanoha told  her, stepping up to stand in front of the younger girl. “Shamal-sensei  has not released you to full duty yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma’am, I have recovered  faster than expected!” Subaru stayed in her spot, still saluting with  her eyes forward. “I am ready to deploy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha looked at her a  moment before sighing. “If I gave your left side a quick jab, would you  flinch?” She watched the blue haired girl swallow thickly and cut her  off before she could reply. “Thought not. I’m sorry, Subaru, you will  stay here. Sometimes staying behind is important as well. If we get any  distress calls while we are out, you and Vita-chan will be here to  handle it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No buts,” She replied instantly. “You will stay here until you are properly healed. End of story.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-san!” Subaru gasped out. “You trained me well, I can do this! I won’t make a mistake!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know you won’t!” The instructor turned on her. “I’m not letting you go because I’m worried about <em>you</em>,  not if you’ll make a mistake!” her gaze softened and a hand was placed  on her student’s shoulder. “You are a great fighter, Subaru, but I  won’t forgive myself if you get hurt to the point where you won’t  recover. I know what that’s like, and I won’t let anyone go through it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Yes ma’am.” Subaru looked down, dejected. “I will stay here then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  get back in bed, you’re not supposed to be moving around until your  ribs heal!” Nanoha thumped her forehead after scolding her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  walked over to her friend and nodded at her. “We need to be off, it  will be twilight soon, they will probably move when it gets dark enough  to cover their tracks.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.” Nanoha gave Subaru one final  smile before hopping into the helicopter, followed closely by the  Lightning members, her girlfriend, and the small Rein.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia walked  over to Subaru and stood in front of her a moment before speaking.  “I’ll take care of everything enough to cover your part too,” She told  her softly as the blades of the aircraft started to turn. “So get some  rest okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Okay. Be safe out there all right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course,” Tia smiled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  to sum things up,” Rein spoke to the group when Tia boarded the  helicopter and sat down. “We have been getting mixed signals of  activated lost logia around the sector seven slums on the outskirts of  Midgard, the town a few hours away from here. We suspect increased  activities of black market trading but the local police force there can  not give us any information since they are not equipped with enough  power to launch a full scale assault. From there we will divide into  two groups: Elio, Caro, Tia, you three will be group “Sky.” Nanoha and  Fate will make up group “Leader.” I will give us tactical advice as we  go along.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Roger!” The three forwards all saluted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Our  primary goal,” Rein picked back up. “Is to find out why this area has  had so many lost logia ran through it and who is behind it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um,”  Elio looked up, getting Rein’s attention. “Is it that uncommon? To my  knowledge there are several types of logia, why are these so important  so suddenly?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A good question,” Nanoha finally joined in. “As  you said there are many different classifications of lost logia ranging  from the harmless to the severely dangerous. The name simply suggest  that the item is from an advanced civilization and that at our current  scientific knowledge we cannot figure it out or replicate it. The item  itself can be anything from entertainment to weaponry. Although we will  investigate everything that is related to illegal possession of logia,  our primary focus is on ‘Relics’. The code name is for items that are  crystalline in nature, but can take on the shape of almost anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Such as Jewel Seeds?” Tia pondered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,”  Nanoha smiled lightly. “They are most definitely powerful things. We  may be dealing with something like that tonight so be sure to use this  time to collect your thoughts and ask any questions okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma’am!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“She  wasn’t lying when she said ‘sums’ was she?” Elio asked aloud as they  looked out the window of the helicopter. The area below them was dark  and run down, spanning several miles all around. “Brings back bad  memories…”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate put a hand on the young male’s head and gave it a  small ruffle of encouragement. “You’ll be fine out there; you have a  home to come back to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro looked over at the other lightning member a little sadly. ‘<em>That’s right, Elio’s parents were killed in a battle…He probably lived alone until Fate-san found him…</em>’  Looking out the window she frowned at the sight of what appeared to be  gang members jumping rooftops to get away from police sirens and  flashing lights. ‘<em>It must be hard living in a place like that…We’ve both been through some hard times already, huh?</em>’ Her small hand reached out and took his, trying to give encouragement to him as much as taking it as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nervous?” He whispered at her softly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” She replied honestly, just as quiet. “I don’t think I’ll ever be confident enough not to be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll protect you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s my line,” She turned to look at him finally, giving the male a smile. “So instead, be my sword?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate’s  voice broke off any more conversation that could be had between the  two. “Okay its time to deploy. Tia, you will be in charge of Sky and I  will guide Leader. Any questions you may have can be sent to me if  we’re in range. This part of town may be a slum, but it still has M2D  capabilities.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes ma’am.” Tia nodded at her as the hatch opened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  gave her students an encouraging nod before they each leapt out, Caro  deciding to grip Elio around the waist from behind since she was scared  of heights. “They’ll be okay…” She spoke more to herself than Fate.  “They’ll be fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They know what they’re getting into,” Fate  told her as the team’s transparent gliders kicked on, allowing them to  sail down quickly to a rooftop without too many people noticing them.  “We need to be prepared as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“High rank mages, huh?” Nanoha  mused, allowing her barrier jacket to form. “We’ve been given triple A  negative access… Why does that make me nervous?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I kind of wish we allowed Yuuno to come,” Fate walked to the open hatch and called forth her armor as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“His  magic is top notch but his body isn’t in the condition to maneuver like  he used to be able to. I’d be too worried to fight at full potential.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate nodded at her knowingly before waving at Vice. “See you in a few hours, Vice-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Safe flight girls!” He called back as they jumped out and flew down to the city below them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“First  things first,” Nanoha told her friend as they flew downwards quickly.  “We need to find the place where the logia keep disappearing. From  there we can probably perch and wait.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All right,” Fate nodded to herself. “The location is just south of here, let’s get to it.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Okay,  from here on out be on guard.” Tia pulled her guns from her side  holsters and double checked them to ensure they were loaded. “We are  officially in enemy territory so I want Caro to watch our right. Elio,  watch our left and I will keep everything ahead of us.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma’am.” Both  of them replied in kind, Elio summoning Strada to his hands. “I have a  really bad feeling about this,” He voiced his worries, eyes darting  around. “I can already feel eyes on us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, just keep walking.”  Tia led them forward, occasionally looking down at her wrist where a  transparent map was displayed. “Our target location is just ahead. If  the information we received is correct, the person who is supposedly  smuggling the loggias should be in a warehouse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia-san, we  have six people following us.” Caro whispered, eyes moving around the  dark alleyways they were traveling. The only light around them came  from random neon flashing signs and streetlamps that flickered with  age. “I’m sorry, seven now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks for the good news,” Tia frowned. “Can we avoid them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“From their current speed it seems like they want to follow us until they’re ready to battle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Smart move,” Elio muttered, gripping his spear tighter. “Tia-san, should we force combat?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  better than allowing them to move us where they want and possibly have  re-enforcements…” The three stopped walking and stood their ground. “I  don’t like being followed!” She called out loudly. Several moments  passed by them in silence before figures started dropping around them  one by one. “Nice welcoming,” She greeted them bitterly, eyes moving  around to confirm that they were surrounded and outnumbered. “Do you  always greet people so promptly?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Smart mouth for a little  girl,” One of them stepped forward and into the light from a  streetlamp. “What are police doing in a place like this? I thought we  were clear on the ‘no fly’ zone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re military,” Tia aimed one  of her guns at him. “Put your hands up and surrender peacefully and you  will have the right to a fair trial.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On what grounds?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For  possession of an illegal object classified as a lost logia and  attempted smuggling of said artifact,” Tia recited the line firmly,  placing her bets on her instincts that these people were the ones she  was after. To her disbelief the people around her started to chuckle  amongst themselves, each pulling a weapon from the shadows. “Tch,” Tia  pulled up her other gun and looked over her shoulder, seeing Caro and  Elio go back to back behind her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What I desire,” Caro whispered softly into the darkness, getting a few eyes on her. “Is a means to bind my opponents…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The brat’s doing the same thing as ‘she’ does!” One of them gasped out. “Stop her!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia’s  guns fired the moment the first man made a move, signally the official  start of their battle. People leapt around them quickly, none staying  in place long enough for the female to properly aim. Two shadows leapt  into the air, bringing her attention to them and allowing another two  to sweep in from the sides. Metal staves were raised up to strike, only  to be cleaved into pieces by the end of Elio’s spear. “No one touches  my friends.” His eyes narrowed.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Battle  mode engaged,” Rein spoke to her partners as they looked over a rooftop  at the ground below them. “Sky has encountered their enemy and are  fighting.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate gripped the staff of Bardiche tighter. “Rein, are you sure their opponents aren’t too strong? They’re a member short…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, from the data sent by their devices they are fighting rank C mages and one B.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They can handle that,” Nanoha spoke confidently. “Our training simulations are harsher than that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  these are real people,” Fate replied, ducking down when she thought  someone would look where they were from the ground. “Will they be able  to…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know if I want them to or not,” Nanoha closed her  eyes. “But this is the military, they knew what they were getting in  when they joined. I just wish their hands didn’t have to be stained so  young.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You girls turned out fine,” Rein supported the two. “So  trust in them as well. For right now, we need to focus on what’s going  on now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha looked up over the edge of the oddly shaped roof she was on. “…That’s odd.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re…they’re  gone!” Nanoha stood up and looked down at a better angle. “No wait,  they’re on the ground…Come on, Fate-chan.” The girl leapt off the roof  quickly, landing in a silent crouch. She felt her partner land behind  herself and after a quick visual scan of the area, ran over to one of  the people laying on the ground. “…He’s out cold.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here too,” Fate spoke up, looking around. “But I don’t see any signs of a skirmish.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Inside,” Rein flew to the door leading into a building and looked into it. “People here are unconscious as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  quickly ran into the building, eyes darting around the tavern. “Ugh, it  smells.” She wrinkled her nose as she stepped over bodies. Raising  Heart hummed in her hand, telling the woman that there were people  nearby. “<em>Fate-chan</em>,” She started talking telepathically. “<em>I’ll go downstairs, you take the upstairs.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Okay,</em>” Fate instantly trotted over to the stairs on the side of the room and looked up them before quietly sneaking upwards.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Rein-chan, let’s go down.</em>”  Nanoha quietly continued along her path until she came to a doorway.  Pressing her back up against it, she nodded to Rein. The small being  flew to the top of the entrance and slipped through it quickly. The  instructor held her breath as she listened to the silence. Her little  partner gave her the all clear, allowing her to quietly slip into the  other room and trot over to the staircase leading downwards. Another  body was stepped over quickly as she made her way over to another  hidden door that lead her back outside. “<em>Fate-chan, come down. There’s a stairway leading into a cellar and a door to the far right. It leads outside.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  dark night engulfed her once again as she walked cautiously down the  back alley littered with garbage and other miscellaneous broken  objects. Ahead of her a streetlamp flickered on in a vain attempt to  illuminate the area, but failing to do so properly. The brief spurt of  light gave Nanoha just enough time to make out three figures ahead of  her. One of them fell to the ground and the other continued along their  way. ‘<em>Bingo,</em>’ Nanoha ran forward quietly, using her training to  keep herself just slightly above the ground so her boots wouldn’t click  on the cracked concrete beneath her. The pair was moving quickly,  sometimes only giving the girl a brief glimpse of their cloaks as they  turned down another street. Rounding the corner, Nanoha left a small  magical smear along the wall that Bardiche could follow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It took  the group almost five minutes to realize they were being followed and  all at once stopped their pace and waited for her patiently. “<em>Fate-san’s in battle mode,</em>” Rein told the girl mentally after getting an inquisitive look. “<em>She said some of the people were waking up</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Guess I’m on my own then,</em>’  Nanoha pulled herself away from her hiding spot and walked over to the  pair. “Good evening,” She greeted them. “Funny place to take a walk  isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s hard to avoid such a place when you have  business that takes you here, isn’t it?” The taller figure replied in  kind, eyeing her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Touché,” Nanoha stopped several paces from  them and gripped her staff. “Would you mind if I had a moment of your  time, you resemble some people I am after; just a few questions and you  will be free to go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not interested,” The taller one spoke again, glaring. “I don’t guess you will just leave us in peace?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,” She apologized, smiling lightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then I will have to-” He took a step forward.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“-wait.” The smaller person held out its hand. “I can feel it coming from her. She has something we could use.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” The hood was brought back, revealing the rugged face of a middle aged man. “What is it, Lutecia?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  smaller person removed her hood, revealing a young looking girl with  flowing purple hair. “I feel it residing within her… The signal of a  repressed lost logia… a Jewel Seed.” She watched the woman in front of  her drop into a battle stance. “The doctor would want to investigate  it.” Her voice was soft and sweet, a dark contrast to the area around  her. “Zest, could you go ahead?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay. What are you going to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia looked back over at Nanoha. “Same thing that the doctor asked us to… I am going to force activate it.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Tia  frowned, shooting several blast at the people approaching her. Two of  her bullets met their targets forcing them to collapse in pain. At  least ten people around her were on the ground withering and moaning  but more were coming steadily. “It seems like when we knock one down  two more come!” Turning she fired rapidly, making several members of  the gang scatter. “Che, more mages.” Her bullets took on a different  color as they got more powerful. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I only have two more reloads before I’m out…We have to end this soon.’</span></em> Her hair ruffled just before she felt her body become lighter. All at  once her reaction time doubled and night vision kicked up several  notches. “Thank you, Caro!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The support mage nodded, already going  into another spell. “What I ask for,” She began as her summoned chains  from earlier finally broke and allowed more of their targets to charge  them all at once. “Metal and wind, flowing away from us…” Her circle  flashed to life, illuminating the area around them brightly. “Flash  wall!” To her call came a thin metal wall, circling them before  expanding outwards and moving with the sudden blast of wind. The simple  attack forced everyone near them to fly backwards and crushed a few  people against the alley walls, making them drop in pain from various  broken bones.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Cute trick,” A voice spoke up, followed by a loud  crashing sound as the wall was torn through. A man stood in front of  them with orange spiky hair and tattoos covering most of his bare upper  body. “But I’m afraid this will be the end of things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Boss!” Several members seemed to regain their confidence at the sight of the man.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Military  mages, huh?” He mused, stepping forward summoning forth a standard  magical staff. “Maybe I’ll be able to get more weapons tonight than I  had originally planned, and without even trading the little brat the  gem I found.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Trading logia for weapons,” Tia whispered, eyes narrowing. “What a fool.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fool  am I?” The man smirked. The next moment Tia found herself against the  wall, scratching desperately at the hand gripping her neck. Two punches  landed on her stomach before she was tossed to the side, rolling on the  ground twice before flipping up and back to her feet. “Oh? You aren’t  an ordinary teenager are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“ ‘Fraid not,” Tia stood up,  trying to recover from the lack of air she now had. “I put you at an A-  rank, something I can handle by myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see. Then I guess I  will have to tip the scales in my favor.” The man waved his hand,  making several people around them watching instantly leap back into the  shadows. To replace them four more people stepped into the light, each  holding a staff device. “You see, my friends here could be classified  as a “B+” as you would call it. A large difference from the “C and D”  ranks you so thoughtlessly gave the rest of my gang.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro stood next to Elio but refused to show her worry. ‘<em>If  that is true then each one would be an even match for us, but we’re  outnumbered still…Granted we have intelligent devices and official  training but… Somehow I don’t think they will hesitate to hurt us.</em>’ Her hand took on a pinkish glow, preparing to boost their abilities even more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Take  out the little girl first!” The leader of the group pointed, instantly  starting the scramble. He himself leapt into the air and jumped up the  random pipes coming from the walls to make it to the rooftops. Tia  scoffed and leapt into the air as well, giving chase to her main target.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I have to keep him separate or we won’t be able to win,</em>’  The girl grabbed a hold of a broken out section of the wall and pushed  off of it after getting her bearings. She continued to scale the walls  just as the man had. ‘<em>two on four with same ranks will be a lot easier than three on five with someone who outclasses us.</em>’ She landed on the roof and scanned the area.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Back  on the ground Elio spun his spear around quickly, forcing the people to  leap backwards to avoid the pulsating blade at the end. Thanks to his  increased agility he managed to dash forward and engage in battle with  one of the less reactive men. Their weapons clashed rapidly for a  moment before Elio’s speed overmatched his opponents and managed to  land in a sweeping blow, drawing blood from his opponent’s arm. The  nameless man stumbled backwards and gripped his arm, but a scream from  behind made Elio turn around quickly to see his partner being triple  teamed. Before he could run to her he felt himself being thrown through  the air after an attack from behind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio-kun!” Caro shouted  out, twirling between the attacks on her and managing to bind two of  the men together with summoned chains. The last man tried to grab her  but she nimbly danced around him and made it to her partner. “You okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,”  Elio spat on the ground. “Just bit my lip.” He held up his spear and  eyed the four men as they regrouped as well. “Any suggestions?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can slow them down, but it will take fifteen seconds.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Start  chanting.” Elio ran forward, slashing his spear along the ground and  sending a ripple of energy along the concrete. The blast made all four  veer to his left where he engaged. He ducked the first blast of energy  and slid along the ground, sweeping the feet out from under one man.  Not pausing, he used his staff to trip another before flipping to his  feet and grabbing a staff swung at him. The force made his hand scream  in pain but he still managed to use it to hop in the air and lash out  his foot and clock the man in the head. The fourth one, however, had  plenty of time to aim his blast, sending Elio flying through the air  once again and crashing into the wall, making cracks spread out from  his impact. The male landed roughly but still darted forward again,  slashing his spear rapidly. His eyes narrowed, seeing their movements  begin to slow thanks to Caro’s magic. The tip of Strada was adjusted  slightly, stabbing one man in the shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">All at once their  speeds increased again at the same moment that Caro cried out in pain.  The spear user leapt backwards to gain some distance before hurrying  over to his partner, who was defending herself against one of the  faster opponents. Elio was once again attacked from behind, forcing his  attention back on the two people who re-engaged with him. Caro’s small  yelp caught his attention, giving the people he was fighting enough  time to stab his dominant arm clean through with a magic bullet. His  scream lasted all of two seconds before a staff was jabbed into his  stomach and head kicked to the side, flooring him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro gasped out, her spell being interrupted once again as she was tossed around from different attacks. ‘<em>I can’t focus on so many at once,</em>’ She cried, sliding across the wet hard ground. ‘<em>I can’t… I can’t…</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio  screamed loudly, dashing forward once more. His attack caught the group  off guard, allowing him to cut into the leg of one man. Almost  immediately all four danced around him, each kicking or hitting him  with magical attacks. The male lasted seven seconds before weakly  collapsing to the ground once more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He’s too green,” The injured man muttered, holding his leg. “That’s three times he could have killed one of us but didn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Elio-kun…Elio-kun!!!</em>’ Caro closed her eyes tightly, screaming at her body to move. ‘<em>I have to support him… I have to!</em>’ The sounds of her partner screaming came to her ears once again but she couldn’t seem to make her magic come to her hands. ‘<em>Please! I have to move! I have to help him! Elio-kun!</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro  opened her eyes, finding herself on a grassy field in a clearing of a  forest. Sitting up, she looked down at her body, seeing a few blood  smears but feeling no pain. “What… What’s going on? Where am I?” Her  eyes scanned the area, seeing a small pond and flowers scattering the  clearing before going into a pretty forest. A rabbit hopped up next to  her and sniffed at the girl before running away when she moved.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  are awake,” A voice made Caro turn to the side and freeze in fear at  the sight of a large silver dragon. “Tell me, little one, why are you  here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I…I…” Caro stood up, looking up at the dragon with wide  eyes. He stood two stories tall with a wingspan that doubled his length  with width. One horn was on his nose, complete with a golden ring  through it. The dragon walked over to her and moved it’s long neck down  so it was more of an eye level with her. Caro saw that its body was  large and had an equally long tail with several spikes on it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  are here on your own will this time,” It spoke to her, mouth not moving  but still getting it’s voice across. “This is the third time we have  met now, but you wouldn’t remember the first two.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve been here…before?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, but now is not the time to discuss that. You are here on your own accord this time; tell me, what is it you desire?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio-kun!” She suddenly remembered. “I have to help Elio-kun!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You wish the power to protect?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes!”  She looked up at the dragon with a new determination in her eyes. “I  want to protect everyone! I want to help those in need, just as  Fate-san helped me! I want… I want to become strong! Strong enough so  none of my precious friends get hurt anymore!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The dragon looked at her steadily. “Then you with an innocent heart and burning soul, tell me… What is your name?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro. Caro Lu Rushie!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then,  Princess Caro, I grant you my power. Call upon me, and I shall help  you.” The area around them faded slowly, the dragon moving into the  mist that enveloped them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro opened her eyes quickly, seeing  the hard wet ground she was laying on. Looking up, she saw Elio pushing  himself upwards yet again. “I may not be as smart as Tia-san…” He  began, weakly stepping forward with blood running down his right arm.  “And I may not be as strong as Subaru-san…” He took another step,  gripping Strada with his left hand. “I may not have as much magical  energy as Caro…” He looked upwards, glaring at them with fire in his  eyes. “But I’m the only male of the group,” The boy ran forward, spear  posed to strike yet again. “So I will protect them!!!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Protect!”  Caro screamed, hand extended towards him. “Freidliche!” The pink glow  shot around the alley, followed closely by the deep roar of a beast.  White mist flooded the area, covering the appearance of the white  dragon. “What I ask for,” Caro started, eyes still locked on Elio.  “Armor to protect my friends, so they will not be hurt, a barrier to  block harmful spells, and the confidence to do what needs to be done!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your wish will be granted.” Freidliche spoke to her, emitting a silver glow around the area.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia pushed herself up slowly, seeing a silver mist hang around her body. ‘<em>This is…Caro’s magic…but how can it reach up here?</em>’  Her eyes turned to the man in front of her, gasping out when his  summoned staff took an energy blade onto it. The blow landed soundly,  but only glanced off her body. ‘<em>I see…Protection magic!’</em> Bringing up her guns, she aimed them at the man’s chest. “Cross mirage!  Stun magic, full power!” Pulling the trigger she injected two yellow  orbs into the man’s body, shocking him to the point of unconsciousness.  Panting, the girl stood up and looked down at her body, seeing a faint  trace of silver mist clinging to her, forming the barrier. “Caro…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kill  him!” The order came out in the thinning mist. Elio narrowed his eyes,  quickly slashing his spear out and flooring the first man. His second  attack was a simple slash, but the end of his spear shot out a large  blast of pink energy, hitting the second man and sending him flying  backwards and through a wall. Finally his third attack was an upward  motion, sending another man soaring into the air, even though he was  several yards away from the boy. “What…what is this!?” The only man  left gasped out as the mist finally began to dissipate to the point  where he could see.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio held onto his spear soundly, eyes  glaring over at him while glowing a deep red. The sound of metal  clicking against metal came when he started calmly walking forward.  Silver armor graced his body, much like a knight from the medieval  times. The joints of his knees and elbows were accented by a point,  graced with a golden loop in the tip. The lack of proper lighting did  nothing from keeping the polished armor from shining, giving accent to  the helmet which displayed proudly the type of knight he was. The helm  had dragon fins on the side, as well as one small horn above the  forehead cover, also bearing the small golden loop in it. His face  wasn’t covered, but his cheeks were blessed with a small silver signals  that appeared to be quarter moons with a line bisecting them  horizontally the mark of a dragoon knight.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I have granted you the power you seek,</em>” Elio heard the voice inside his head as he calmly moved forward towards his last opponent. “<em>In return, you will serve and protect my master, Princess Caro Lu Rushie.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Understood,</em>” He answered mentally before the presence of the dragon faded from him. “You,” He pointed with his staff. “Surrender.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Never!” The man darted forward quickly. “I will kill the one giving you power!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  will not harm her!” Elio blurred to the side. “Sonic Move!” His spear  impaled the man from behind before he could get close to Caro. With a  slash, he sent the man flying from the end of his spear and crashing  into the wall leaving a blood smear as he slid down it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is  everything okay?” Tia asked as she dropped from the roof. “How are-  what the hell is that!?” She pointed up at the Dragon behind Caro when  the streetlights decided to flash again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The dragon looked down  at the three people before glowing and shrinking down in size, finally  reaching the point of a large dog. The dragon stood on all four legs,  allowing its tail to sway out behind himself casually. “Freidliche,”  Caro stated, pushing herself up slowly with Elio’s help. “Thank you…”  She reached out and hugged the dragon, getting a small purr.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio…?  Is that you?” Tia knelt down as well, looking at the armor clad boy.  “What…?” She looked at her own body, still seeing the silver mist. “Is  this the dragon’s power or Caro’s?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Both,” The young girl replied, still hugging her new friend. “I’m tired… Can I rest?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” Tia answered softly. “Good job you two.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro  nodded lightly before finally falling over onto the ground. All at once  the glow around Tia vanished and Elio’s armor shattered into a mist  that floated away. “Caro-hime!” Elio shouted out, reaching over and  making sure the girl was all right.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia looked at the dragon, who was giving an approving look to the male. “I’m so confused…”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha glared at the young girl in front of her. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She can’t be any older than Caro-chan</span></em>’  She thought to herself as she circled around her opponent. “You are the  one who has been activating the lost logia around here, why?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The doctor wants me to test their power, and bring back the strong ones to him.” She replied easily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Doctor?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I answered one of your questions, it’s rude to ask another,” She told Nanoha, voice still calm and sweet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry,” The flying Ace apologized, shocking herself to realize that she  actually kind of meant it since the girl didn’t have any malice in her  voice at all. “I am here to stop you, will you surrender peacefully?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  can not,” Lutecia looked at her, a magical circle spreading beneath her  feet. Instantly Nanoha formed several balls of energy around herself  and fired more than half of them all at once. The magic streaked  towards the young girl but stopped mere inches from her body. “What I  ask for,” Her spell began. “Is the release of power within…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha’s  throat went dry, hearing the familiar thundering of her heartbeat in  her ears. “What…?” Again the sound repeated in her ears, making her  hands shake. “Not this… not this again!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-san!” Rein flew over to the girl as she clutched her chest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rein…run!  Get Fate!” Nanoha looked up at her scared. The Iris in her eyes were  already being flecked with yellow, covering the slate blue orbs.  “HURRY!” The cry made the small girl nod and fly off in the direction  they had come. “What…are you doing?” She managed out, glaring at the  purple haired girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Disregard your limits and come back into the world,” Lutecia kept on, eyes closed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Gasping out, Nanoha had to take a few steps backwards to prevent herself from collapsing. ‘<em>I don’t have a sealing round,</em>’ She thought frantically, trying to repress the feelings inside her body. ‘<em>My only chance is to hope Fate gets here soon with hers…</em>’  Her legs gave out all at once, making her fall to her knees. Panting,  she looked down at her body in fear. A yellow and black ooze like  substance was already consuming her, reforming her barrier jacket to  something that it desired instead. “Fate-chan… Fate-chan… Fate… Fate…  Fate.Fate. Fate!Fate!Fate-Fate-FateFateFateFaaaaate!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha felt  her insides shatter, pain flaring all around her as the jewel seed’s  last seal broke. Everything went silent as her eyes went blind. The  girl looked around, realizing she could see herself but nothing else  around her. The sound of a tuning fork echoed around the girl, making  her look behind herself and finally seeing someone else. The female in  front of her wore a tight outfit of yellow and black leather. Black  boots with yellow highlights, complete with two spikes on the heel  jutting out behind them. Her legs held the same black leather armor  with criss-crossing strips of yellow running up them. The chest piece  was pitch black with only a yellow slash running from her left shoulder  down across her chest and to the right side of her waist. The shoulders  were covered with three yellow spikes coming out from them. Along her  arms the black leather clung to the skin tightly, accented by several  yellow curved spikes. Gloves were on her hands, each finger section  being separated by smaller yellow curved blades, as well as sharp  pointed nails. Finally Nanoha looked at the face, shocked to find her  own looking back at her. Ever so slowly the ooze slid up her neck and  covered her mouth and nose with a type of ninja mask, going back and  also covering her ears. The hair was let down from the ponytails and  the white ribbons vanished slowly, allowing the brown strands to fly  out behind her. Yellow eyes glared at her before her own voice spoke to  her. “I’m free.” With those two words, Nanoha’s eyes rolled up in her  head, finally losing consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The woman stood slowly,  looking around to take in her surroundings. The circle on the ground  vanished, drawing her attention to the purple haired girl a few paces  from her. “Who are you?” She asked after a moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lutecia,” She replied simply. “I set you free. What is your name?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  woman looked down at her hands, flexing her fingers. “Hehehehe…. Ah  hahahahaha…. Hahahahahahaha!” She threw back her head and bent  backwards, laughing loudly. “I’m free, I’m free, I’m free, I’m FREE!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The word made the woman look to the side, smiling under her mask. “She’s dead, only I remain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate felt herself suddenly start to feel sick to her stomach. “The seal…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is  broken,” She replied angrily, throwing out one hand and revealing  something like bat wings on her back. Gripping her fist, she laughed  again. “Now…finally! I can get my revenge!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I need you to come with me,” Lutecia spoke again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I will follow no one,” She spoke, glaring.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bardiche!”  Fate flipped her staff, knocking the shells in the revolver onto the  ground and slamming a single bullet into it. “Sealing mode!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think not!” The black and yellow woman blurred, clearing the distance  between them so fast her punch left a small shockwave around them that  scattered the dirt on the ground. Fate’s auto shield shattered  instantly, making the woman bounce and skid several times before  crashing into a wall. “I have something I need to do, so I refuse to be  locked away again!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha…” Fate pushed herself up slowly, coughing a little blood from the blow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  name is Skeith,” She corrected her, quickly moving in front of the  blond and hefting her into the air from her neck. “Listen, Fate, if you  so much as attempt to try and seal me again I will not only kill you,  but I will kill Elio, I will kill Caro, I will kill Hayate, and  everyone else will die as well. Am I clear?” Three punches landed onto  the blonde’s stomach before another clipped across her head, knocking  her out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Skeith-san, I request that you come with me,” Lutecia said again, walking over to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  refuse. I need to find someone first.” Skeith flared out her wings,  rising into the air. “Do not think I am indebted to you, Lutecia.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  girl looked a little saddened by the turn of events. “I see. Well, I  shall be on my way then. We will cross paths later.” With that she  turned and continued along her intended path, leaving the unconscious  blond and the small Rein by themselves.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Nanoha….Nanoha…” Fate turned over, wincing in pain.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Easy there,” A male voice told her, gently moving her so she was on her back again. “Hang in there Fate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Vice,” Her eyes opened slowly, seeing the pilot above her. “...Where…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re on the helicopter,” he told her as Rein flew above the girl. “We are waiting on Sky to get here before we take off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Nanoha?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…We don’t know where she is,” Rein told her sadly. “Hayate is scanning for her right now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate’s eyes brimmed with tears. “I couldn’t save her…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  rest,” Vice commanded, looking out the hatch to see some people coming  up to him. “You’re lucky you don’t have a concussion. Rein said the  person who hit you ranked at least double S+.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That was her…”  Fate whispered sadly. “That was her…Oh god, I couldn’t help her… I  couldn’t…I…” Her words broke off as she dissolved into sobs.  “Nanohaaaa…..”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rein looked over at the hatch, gasping out at the  silver dragon who boarded the helicopter with the others. Elio looked  like he had been through hell but still managed to carry Caro piggyback  style. Tia looked a little worse for wear but otherwise seemed to be  all right. “Long story,” Tia told her, nodding at the dragon. “But we  recovered a handful of logia from the group of people who were going to  trade them. We don’t know who they were trading <em>with</em> but the leader is being arrested and- what the hell happened to Fate-san!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Long  story,” Rein sighed. “Vice-kun, get us back to base, I have a feeling  our debriefing session is going to be long and complicated…”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“I see,” Hayate looked at the dragon sitting next to Caro’s hospital bed. “And she just passed out after her summon?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes ma’am.” Elio nodded. “She seemed exhausted.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  knew her abilities would awaken soon but I didn’t think it would be  this early…” She looked down at the dragon. “And he is her summon?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Freidliche,” Elio confirmed. “He was the one who gave me my armor… Although I can’t summon it back on my own.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Her  linker core is dangerously low,” Shamal informed them as she looked  over her charts. “I was given the information from the scientist where  Caro was at before, and they match almost precisely. Given the history,  she should be weak for a few days but she will be fine shortly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Will  the dragon not sap all her energy?” Subaru pondered, looking over them  and down at the dragon sleeping at the foot of the bed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Freidliche  is a summon, not a familiar,” Shamal mused, looking at the small  dragon. “I’m assuming he won’t leave her, otherwise he wouldn’t have  adapted to a smaller size…Elio-kun, later I would like to run some  scenarios with you and Caro to try and figure out why you are so much  more prone to advanced support magic if that’s okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d really  rather not be studied…” He gave Shamal an apologetic look. “I’m sorry,  I’m not comfortable with being a test subject.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…I see; I’m sorry I offended you.” Shamal smiled at him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, where is Nanoha-san?” Subaru pondered, looking around. “I would have figured she’d be next to Fate-san by now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  what’s going on?” Tia asked as well. “Rein-san said she would tell us  when we got here, but all we’ve done was go over Caro?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate  looked down. “Well, there’s something you should know about  Nanoha-chan…” The girls looked on in shock as Hayate retold the tale  about the jewel seed so many years ago. “So the worst case scenario has  happened…She has been taken over.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I… I see…” Subaru looked over at Fate as she slept peacefully. “And Fate-san…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Saw  it all happen,” Hayate finished for her. “Shamal sedated her after she  got over her shock and tried to go look for her on her own. We are  scanning the surrounding area as well as expanding the field slowly. We  will find her. Until then, I want all of you to rest and be prepared to  battle again in a few days time. Training will be put on hold so use  your time wisely and learn from the encounters you had tonight so you  won’t make the same mistakes again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma’am.” They all saluted.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Elio wandered through the streets slowly, eyes glazed over as he reflected back on the battle he had the day before. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He’s too green</span></em>; the words came back again and again, each time making him feel worse about himself. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I ended up killing one anyway,</span></em>’ He thought sadly as he walked aimlessly. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If I hadn’t hesitated in the first place, Caro-hime wouldn’t be in bed right now…</span></em>’ He shook his head quickly. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No, I can’t think like that…Fate-san doesn’t want me to be a cold blooded killer…But I still took a life… I killed someone…</span></em>’  His feet kept walking, ignoring the people looking at him. Although he  was in civilian clothing he still felt like he stood out from the rest  of the people around him. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If I didn’t, though, Caro-hime would have been hurt.</span></em>’ His lips twitched lightly at the name. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I guess I belong to her now since I made a deal with her dragon for the ability to help her.</span></em>’
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The boy looked up, seeing that the sun was already starting to set. ‘<em>I don’t feel like going back right now…</em>’  His eyes looked around, realizing that he knew where he was for the  first time. Walking a little more he found a familiar place and walked  into it. He scanned the area a moment, only seeing a few people inside  the building. One person caught his attention so he walked over across  the empty dance floor and sat at the bar, next to Vita.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Little  boys shouldn’t come into bars un-supervised,” She greeted him without  even looking. The pig tailed girl threw her head back and gulped a  liquid Elio couldn’t place before slamming the shot glass onto the  counter, upside down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not really in a good mood,” he told her as Kuhn walked over to them. “I need a beer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vita  looked over at him sideways. “Eh? What’s that?” One arm reached out and  grabbed the front of his shirt, making him look at her. “We don’t come  here to get drunk, brat.” Her eyes were slightly hazy, showing that  despite her words, she was tipsy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then why do you come here?” He asked softly, getting let go of and fixing his shirt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Understanding.”  Vita looked up at Kuhn and was given another shot of a dark fluid.  “Kuhn has seen many things in his lifetime… his drinks are a symbol for  military.” She gulped it down as well, slamming the glass back onto the  bar. “Don’t come in here and disgrace us with your problems by crying  into something alcoholic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I killed someone for the first time,” Elio told her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Congratulations.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not something I want to be congratulated for,” He retorted, getting a smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good,  I was going to hit you if you said ‘thanks’ after all.” The girl looked  at the many different bottles behind the bar. “Elio, you are young. You  will do many things you don’t want to, but you need to realize that  even if you do kill someone, you do it so many more will live. We’re  military… it’s what we do. As long as you keep it in your heart, a  reason for your actions, then you will never become like them. It’s  only when you kill for the sake of killing that you’ve become a pawn.  We are not pawns, Elio. We are proud warriors, and as such, we must  stand tall and walk forward.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio looked down at the bar top for a while before a drink was slid in front of him. “What’s this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  neon sissy-fied slushie.” Kuhn answered. “Strawberry daiquiri. The  color is one that you will get used to seeing, so don’t let little  things like that bother you. Keep your wits about you little boy, and  don’t let reference haunt your dreams and cloud your mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Understanding…huh?”  Elio took a long drink, amazed at the combination of sweetness to  bitterness it held. “… I think I understand… Why are you here,  sub-lieutenant Vita?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl smiled to herself, looking down. “I’m trying to drink away my worry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Nanoha-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”  Vita looked at Kuhn, who shook his head to signal that he wasn’t going  to serve her any more hard stuff. “If you tell anyone, I’m going to  beat your brains in with my hammer.” She pointed to his drink and  looked at Kuhn, who thought a moment before going to make her one as  well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes ma’am.” Elio took another drink and tasted it slowly. “We are going to look for her soon, aren’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.  Hayate has already planned it out. She may look calm on the outside but  don’t let it fool you, she’s scrambling every moment she can to do  everything in the world to find Nanoha. As soon as we get a lock on  her, I won’t be surprised if half the base is deployed to bring her  back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see…” The boy closed his eyes in thought. “Well then, I  guess I should get some good sleep tonight… I want to go looking on my  own.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hard to do when you can’t even fly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think I’ll manage.” Elio grinned, feeling for the first time as if he became a little more mature that night.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here  you go, kiddo.” Kuhn spoke up, placing the drink in front of Vita. The  girl blushed lightly, realizing that it had whip cream on the top, as  well as a few cut strawberries on the brim of the glass. He had gone  out of his way to make the drink cute and girly for her. “On the house.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vita  took it and sipped through the swirly straw after licking some of the  cream off of it. “If you tell anyone about this, I’m going to tell them  you gave a ten year old alcohol.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure, sure.”</span></p>

Fate  woke up quickly, sweating from the nightmare she had just had. Sitting  up, she looked around her living room to calm herself down. As soon as  her breath steadied it self she waved out her hand and called forth a  monitor display. “Bardiche,” she spoke, voice still tired. “Show me the  results in the scanning, please.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes sir,” Several more screens  appeared in front of the girl. “There have been two sightings of Skeith  in the northern district of the capital city.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you to wake me if you found anything!” Fate screamed, getting up off her couch and calling forth her barrier jacket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your  body was too weak to move even if you knew, sir.” Bardiche told her as  she flew out one of her windows and into the morning air. “Sir, please  rest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No! I have to find her!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan!” Hayate’s  voice came paired with a screen flying alongside her. “Return to the  base this instant! I’m just as worried as you are but killing yourself  by searching will only slow you down in the long run!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m going to find her!” Fate screamed. “It’s been a week, I can’t wait any longer!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  never waited in the first place!” Hayate told her angrily. “Don’t think  I wouldn’t be out there as well if I thought it would be the best  course of action to-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry,” Fate’s words made Hayate stop her scolding. “Hayate, please, permission for flight?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“….Okay.”  She sighed softly. “Fate…I’ll give you constant permission for personal  flight if you promise me you will rest properly okay? You can stay at  my apartment if you need to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” Fate nodded at her. “I will come back for lunch…okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See you then, Fate-chan…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Now alone, Fate pushed herself harder, flying quickly over the city. ‘<em>Nanoha has been taking out people with lost logia non-stop… if I activate one maybe she will come to me.</em>’  Her eyes turned over to Bardiche. “Pull out.” The word worked and Fate  picked up the small jewel seed they had found inside one of the  destroyed gadget drones. ‘<em>These are weak but it’s all I have…</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hours  passed by slowly as the girl flew around town, searching everything  with her eyes and heart. Several places were looped around, and  countless people were asked if they saw the girl. After her hopes were  dashed yet again by a false sighting she let out a small sigh and  looked up into the air. ‘<em>Nanoha…where are you…</em>?’ The girl  readied herself to once again leap into the sky but a sudden feeling of  something jabbing her heart made her stop and slowly turn around.  “Na…noha…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I already warned you,” Skeith spoke, easily walking  towards her, scaring the civilians nearby enough to scatter away from  the scary looking girl. “Nanoha is dead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Liar!” Fate glared at her. “Let Nanoha go right now!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  grit her teeth together in fury, calling forth Bardiche into Zanber  form “Then I’m afraid I’ll have to force you off of her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You would attack your lover?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  pain she is feeling is more than I could ever do to her body. She’s  hurting! She’s crying! I can feel it in my heart, she’s alive! Give her  back to me!” thrusting her sword upwards, she released a barrier around  them, trapping Skeith within it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you want to fight,” Skeith  crouched down in a battle stance while flexing her clawed fingers.  “Then come on; Let’s fight.” She watched Fate dash forward with her  long sword raised to strike. Skeith simply caught the blade with her  hand and gripped it tightly so it couldn’t be pulled away. Fate growled  deep in her throat, twisting the handle of her sword and breaking it in  half long ways. With the new half sword free, she turned around and  slashed it to force Skeith away from her. Landing, Skeith slid across  the concrete, claws digging a small trench into the grounds. “Not bad,”  She mused, pushing forward.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!” Fate screamed in her face  as the two met in a stalemate, Skeith gripping both blades of the now  dual swords. “Wake up!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s too late!” Skeith kicked her  stomach, doubling Fate over enough to slam both her hands into her back  and forcing the blond down into the ground, shattering the area around  her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s never too late!” Fate screamed, grabbing Skeith’s  ankle and slinging her to the side with a fast jerking of her hand.  “Nanoha, fight back!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up!” the woman roared, running  forward again and attacking. Several magic balls of energy came to life  around her, each homing in on the other girl. Fate leapt back into the  air and slashed her swords quickly, effectively deflecting all of them  into random buildings around the two. The structures immediately gave  way to the damage and collapsed around them. Not deterred by the  falling debris, the two clashed again. Sparks flew around them as the  magic blades clashed against the armor of Skeith’s arms and hands.  “You’re faster than before,” She snarled deeply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, you’re just  slower.” Fate kicked Skeith’s shin hard enough to make her foot  unbalanced before shoving her onto the ground. “Nanoha! I know you can  hear me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut <em>up</em> I said!” Skeith slammed her elbow back  onto the ground, breaking a large hole into it and giving her enough  room to rear back and punch the blond in the stomach. The other girl  flew backwards in the air to absorb some of the shock and twisted  around the still falling debris. A black streak followed her quickly  and once again clashed with her in the air. The two shot away form each  other and flew to the side quickly, circling before once again ramming  into each other and attacking. “I’ll rip you apart!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate chose  to ignore the statement, instead focusing on slashing her twin swords.  Two nicks flecked the black armor, making Fate inwardly wince at the  blood. She pressed on still, disregarding the several cuts along her  body from the sharp blades around Skeith’s arms and hands. Finally they  were in another stalemate with Fate’s one sword inching toward Skeith’s  neck and the other pushing back the hand that was trying to rip into  her chest. “Nanoha! I believe in you, wake up!” Skeith’s body shook  lightly, allowing Fate to overpower her enough to pin her against the  side of a building in the air. “Nanoha!!!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly the mask covering Skeith’s face crept down, revealing her nose and mouth. “Fate…chan…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha! Fight back! Force it down!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I…  can’t…” The black ooze started to creep upwards again. “Fate…don’t let  me… hurt anyone else…I’ve…already… murdered… too many…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha! Don’t give up!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Save…  me…” The mask reclaimed its spot and the eyes flared a bright yellow  again. Fate felt several balls of energy rip into her chest and  stomach, forcing her back away from the girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Flying back, she  knocked away the remaining magic bullets and panted as the smoke  cleared, neither seeing nor feeling Nanoha anywhere close to her  anymore, barrier being destroyed. “Damn it… DAMN IT!” Slowly she sank  to the ground and held herself as tears came to her eyes. “Again… I  failed again…Nanoha…”</span></p>
