<h1>Master of the Knight</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nanoha/index.html">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nanya.html">Nanya</a><br> </h2>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sighing as she sank into the tub, Vita 
smiled lightly. Nothing was better than relaxing in the bath after a 
hard day outside. Especially with how hot it had been lately, on top 
of that, the bath tub felt really good, granted it could have been a 
lot hotter if she had wanted it to be, but the moderately warm water 
was just perfect to relax in. Closing her eyes, she just relaxed, enjoying 
the feel of the water around her.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">She didn&#39;t know how long she was in there 
for, but the next thing she knew was that the door to the bathroom was 
opening up and Hayate making her way in. &quot;Oh! Vita! Sorry, I didn&#39;t 
know you were in here.&quot; The brown-haired woman apologized as she 
stood in the doorway.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Vita shrugged and sat up. &quot;Eh, it&#39;s 
okay. You wanna take a bath? I don&#39;t think standing there with a towel 
over your front is really a good thing.&quot; When Hayate smiled at 
her and walked in, Vita couldn&#39;t help but smile back. Her master, though 
Hayate would smack her with a harisen fan if she said that outloud, 
was, in Vita&#39;s opinion, probably the nicest person alive. Even Nanoha 
wasn&#39;t as nice, and that was saying something.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Watching her lather her hair and body 
up, Vita couldn&#39;t help but admire just how beautiful Hayate truly was. 
Sure, she had overheard various men and women talk about Nanoha, or 
Fate, or even Signum, the eternally small knight knew that those three 
were very pretty, even if they were, in her opinion, boob monsters compared 
to some women, but Hayate was in a class of her own. Not that Vita would 
really ever comment on it, even if there was an attraction to her, it 
really didn&#39;t mean anything. As Hayate slipped into the tub with her, 
Vita was just happy that in the twelve years she had been Hayate&#39;s knight, 
she couldn&#39;t wish for anything better in life. Well, maybe if she grew 
a little, just a little... She was tired of shopping in the children&#39;s 
department for new casual clothes.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Achoo!&quot; Hayate sneezed cutely, 
covering her nose. &quot;Sorry.&quot;</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;You getting sick?&quot; Vita frowned 
worriedly.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Maybe someone&#39;s talking about me?&quot; 
Hayate giggled softly as Vita rolled her eyes at her.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;More likely they&#39;re complaining 
about your groping fetish.&quot; She responded dryly.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Hmm? You mean, like this?&quot; 
Vita&#39;s eyes widened as she squacked out indignantly as Hayate, somehow 
in less than an instant, got behind her, squeezed and rubbed her nonexistant 
chest, all the while smiling and humming softly. &quot;Oh my! It looks 
like Vita&#39;s actually growing some breasts now.&quot; She said lightly, 
half serious.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Nnngh... No I&#39;m not.&quot; Vita 
muttered, putting up with the fondling, though her face did feel a bit 
flush from the sensations, it didn&#39;t help that Hayate was holding on 
and not letting go right away. Vita groaned and moved, slapping Hayate&#39;s 
hands to the side. &quot;Hayate... Stop...&quot; She groaned as she 
slipped to the other side of the tub and crawled out, her face bright 
red.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Vita?&quot; Hayate frowned, not 
worried about the fact that Vita pushed her away, but more worried that 
she had hurt or upset her smallest knight. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;N..Nothing, Hayate...&quot; Vita 
was wrapped up in a towel, vacating the room. &quot;Sorry.&quot;</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Vita...&quot; Hayate called out 
after Vita softly. Had she taken it too far? Getting up, she quickly 
dried off and went after Vita. She needed to know what was wrong.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">(---)</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Vita shuddered as she sat against the 
door in her room, still naked, her face and body flushed still. &quot;Vita? 
Please, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; She could hear Hayate&#39;s voice on the other 
side of her door, worried and sad.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Tears fell down Vita&#39;s face, she wasn&#39;t 
truly upset, the tingling that she felt across her body from Hayate 
was still there and not going away. It was confusing to her, she didn&#39;t 
know what to think about it. The dampness on her face, not from the 
bathwater, matched the growing dampness between her legs. It wasn&#39;t 
that she disliked what happened...</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">She was worried that she liked it too 
much.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Still, sticking around here was too much 
at the moment. &quot;Sorry, Hayate.&quot; She mumbled as she got up 
and got dressed. She needed to talk to someone about this and sort her 
own feelings out.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Part two...</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sitting at an outdoor cafe, Vita, dressed 
in a black skirt and a red-striped t-shirt, knee-high stockings and 
tennis shoes, sighed heavily, this really wasn&#39;t that great of an idea, 
if she was honest with herself, but she didn&#39;t know what to do. Hayate 
confused her, a lot. She had thought about visiting Nanoha, or even 
Fate, but she quickly shot those ideas down, mostly because neither 
of them had been at home when she had stopped by. She could have gone 
to see someone else, but she didn&#39;t know anyone well enough to talk 
to them, the admirals, maybe, they wouldn&#39;t mind seeing her, but she 
didn&#39;t want to bother them with her own personal problems. That and 
she wasn&#39;t truly close to any of them. There was Yuuno, but Vita was 
almost certain that the librarian was worse at relationships than she 
was. Though, considering how close he was with Nanoha and Fate, she 
sometimes wondered.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">She honestly wouldn&#39;t be surprised if 
the three of them showed up and announced that they had been in a relationship 
for the past decade. Not that she paid too much attention to it. The 
three seemed more attached to their work than each other at times, even 
if Vivio managed to drag them away from their work to pay attention 
to her all the time.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;There you are.&quot; A familiar 
voice caused Vita to jump in her chair lightly. &quot;Hayate called 
me and asked me to help find you.&quot;</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Looking behind her, Vita could only look 
at her other best friend, dressed in casual slacks, a light blue shirt 
and some sneakers. &quot;Hello, Nanoha.&quot; She said softly, causing 
the brown-haired woman to frown lightly at her.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Vita?&quot; She said softly and 
sat down next to her. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; Now that Nanoha had 
a better look at Vita, she could see that the short knight really didn&#39;t 
look all that well, her hair was hanging limply down on her shoulders, 
her eyes were blood-shot and there was... Well, the brunette wasn&#39;t 
sure exactly, but if she had to call it anything, she had to say it 
felt like an aura of sadness. &quot;Did Hayate upset you?&quot; When 
Vita shook her head, Nanoha grabbed her shoulder. &quot;Hey, this isn&#39;t 
like you. What&#39;s wrong?&quot;</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Shrugging off Nanoha&#39;s hand, Vita rolled 
her shoulder and shook her head. &quot;I... I don&#39;t know...&quot; She 
finally admitted, sighing heavily. &quot;I... I&#39;m confused.&quot; She 
finally admitted, causing Nanoha to blink at her a few times.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;What happened?&quot; Nanoha asked 
her, her eyes soft, worried about her small friend. When Vita started 
explaining, realization dawned on her. &quot;You felt uncomfortable 
when she was groping you?&quot;</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Vita was silent for a bit, squirming 
slightly in her seat. She didn&#39;t really want to face this, but she didn&#39;t 
want to go home to face nothing but confusion and unsettling feelings. 
&quot;A little... But...&quot;</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Nanoha blinked as Vita&#39;s face started 
to turn red, even from the groping, Vita never turned that red before. 
&quot;What?&quot;</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;IthinkIlikedittoomuch!&quot; Vita 
got out in one breath, her face even more flush, if that was possible.</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Uh, Vita, I didn&#39;t catch that.&quot;</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Repeating what she said, albeit slower, 
Vita turned more and more red with each word, causing Nanoha to blush 
slightly at the words. &quot;Nanoha, what... What should I do?&quot;</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I... Actually don&#39;t know.&quot; 
She admitted, causing Vita to slump even more in her chair. &quot;Vita, 
maybe you like Hayate.&quot;</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Of course I like her!&quot; She 
snapped, almost insulted that Nanoha thought she wouldn&#39;t like her master 
at all.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Nanoha shook her head. &quot;I mean, 
you&#39;re attracted to her. That you like her more than just a friend.&quot;</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Vita blinked, blinked again, before it 
dawned on her. &quot;You mean... Like how Chrono and Amy..?&quot; She 
trailed off, a shell-shocked look on her face from the realization. 
&quot;But... She&#39;s my master... I... I&#39;m a knight, I&#39;m not supposed 
to...&quot;</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Nanoha put her finger on Vita&#39;s lips, 
causing her to quiet down before she started bringing attention to herself. 
&quot;Vita, you and the rest of the Wolkenritter mentioned that Hayate 
was the best master you ever had, the only one who thought about you 
first and took care of you. You&#39;ve had a life for over a decade now. 
Maybe, just maybe, your feelings for her changed along the way?&quot;</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Vita blinked and smiled lightly. &quot;For 
someone who&#39;s so dense when it comes to her own relationships, how is 
it that you can put things into perspective for others so easily?&quot;</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Nyahahahaha...&quot; She laughed 
nervously. &quot;Hey, who&#39;s dense?&quot; She mock-glared at her friend, 
who stuck her tongue out in response.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Part Three</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Vita looked at the house that she had 
come to call home. She wasn&#39;t sure if Hayate felt anything for her other 
than a housemate and a friend. It didn&#39;t matter though, Nanoha had been 
right about one thing, that she needed to talk to Hayate about how she 
felt, otherwise it might get a lot worse, for both of them.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;Just remember, even if she doesn&#39;t 
feel the same way about you, Hayate won&#39;t kick you out of the house.&quot;</i></font> 
<br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Even if the thought of Hayate not feeling 
the same way about her made her chest ache horribly, Nanoha was right, 
her master wasn&#39;t one to kick her out of the house over something like 
this. She just hoped that Hayate wouldn&#39;t distance herself after this.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;I do wonder, Vita, why is it 
that you, Signum and Shamal never complain about Hayate groping you?&quot;</i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;It&#39;s not that bad. At least 
that&#39;s all she does.&quot;</i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The conversation had dropped off after 
that, Vita never wanted to think about the things some of their masters 
had done to Signum or Shamal. Or the really twisted ones to her and 
Zafira.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Still, that stuff was lifetimes ago, 
Hayate would never do that stuff to them, well, other than the groping 
at random times.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Vita!&quot; Hayate&#39;s voice caught 
up to the mini knight a moment before she found herself in a tight hug, 
her face pressed against fairly modest cleavage, though that was compared 
to people like Nanoha, Fate and Signum, all three of them were far too 
large in the chest, in Vita&#39;s opinion. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry! I didn&#39;t 
mean to.&quot; Vita could feel Hayate sobbing lightly, which made her 
wince.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Hayate...&quot; Vita muttered and 
hugged her master tightly, just glad that she could hold on tightly. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, for worrying you.&quot; She managed to sniffle out. 
Seeing Hayate get so worried and upset really bothered her. &quot;I 
just had something I needed to work out.&quot;</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Vita?&quot; Hayate frowned lightly 
and pulled back to look at the blushing redhead. &quot;Why did you just 
leave? I&#39;m willing to listen to you.&quot;</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I just... Get so confused...&quot; 
Vita muttered softly, causing her master&#39;s eyes to soften before Vita 
found herself in another hug.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Want to talk about it?&quot; Hayate 
smiled as Vita nodded against her chest. &quot;Come on, I&#39;ll put some 
tea on.&quot;</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Okay...&quot; Vita muttered as 
they walked into the house. &quot;Hayate...&quot;</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Yeah?&quot;</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Please don&#39;t grope me in the tub 
anymore.&quot; Hayate blinked, but nodded at her. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t 
be fair to have to change the water for the others to get in.&quot;</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The short-haired brunette wondered just 
why Vita would bring that up in confusion. It wasn&#39;t like she got dirty 
before getting into the tub, so... The brunette&#39;s eyes widened and she 
blushed heavily. &quot;Oh...&quot; She muttered as she got it.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Vita smiled as she sat down and watched 
Hayate start to make tea. Getting a good look at her master and friend, 
Vita saw what Hayate was wearing, flip-flops, a brown pair of pants 
that barely reached her knees and an over-sized orange t-shirt that 
barely held onto her shoulders and gave the impression of a low-necked 
blouse worn under a small vest in virginal white with the straps tied 
together at the shoulders in innocent little string-bows. &quot;Hayate...&quot; 
She smiled in thanks as she was given the tea.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Vita... I, um... Boy this is hard.&quot; 
She admitted after sitting awhile in silence.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Vita slumped after hearing that, she 
knew that she shouldn&#39;t have gotten her hopes up. &quot;Sorry... I&#39;ll 
just...&quot;</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Vita, wait...&quot; Hayate grabbed 
the small knight by her arm. &quot;I... I don&#39;t know how I feel, but...&quot;</font> 
<br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Vita blinked, her eyes widening slightly. 
&quot;But..?&quot; Dare she hope?</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Vita, I... I&#39;m willing to... Willing 
to give it a chance.&quot; She smiled lightly as Vita turned and hugged 
her tightly. Returning the hug, Hayate smiled to herself, regardless 
of anything else, Vita deserved a chance for real happiness, if Hayate 
could help her get that chance, then the brunette would at least give 
it a try.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Vita deserved that much at least.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">End</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Omake:</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I couldn&#39;t help myself here... This is 
just a short Omake, but it would fit so perfectly.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Vita never wanted to think about the 
things some of their masters had done to Signum or Shamal. Or the really 
twisted ones to her and Zafira, and then there were the weird ones, 
that one pervert came to mind. &#39;Honestly, what kind of a man needed 
people to steal so much female underwear?&#39; Vita wondered to herself.</font> <br>
