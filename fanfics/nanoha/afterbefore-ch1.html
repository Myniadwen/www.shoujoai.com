<h1>After A's, Before Strikers</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nanoha/index.html">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The sixteen year old reddish-brown haired young woman hurried home from 
school, her heart racing joyfully. &quot;I&#39;m home!&quot; Nanoha Takamachi called 
out, her long ponytail bouncing against her back as she hurried in, 
taking off her shoes at the door.

&quot;Welcome home,&quot; her sister Miyuki called, her tied back brown hair 
giving her a almost boyishly handsome look. &quot;Is today the big day?&quot; she 
asked.

Nanoha blushed slightly as she said, &quot;Yes, we&#39;re meeting there later 
this evening.&quot; She walked over, giving her sister a concerned look as 
she asked her, &quot;Are mom and dad still okay with this?&quot;

Miyuki smiled back at her comfortingly, &quot;Trust me, they&#39;re fine. It was 
really less of a surprise than when you revealed your magic to them.&quot;

Nanoha laughed softly, remembering her, Lindy Harlaown and Fate sitting 
in the living room with the family explaining about magic and the 
Time-Space Administration Bureau. Their parents had taken it 
surprisingly well, occasionally making Nanoha wonder about what they did 
before they had her.

&quot;All right,&quot; Nanoha turned and hurried up the stairs as she called, 
&quot;then I&#39;d better start getting ready.&quot;

Part of Nanoha was tempted to dress in a variation on what she had first 
worn when they met, but she decided on something a bit more mature. She 
picked out a nice white skirt and matching jacket, wearing a rose shirt 
under that. After a moment&#39;s hesitation she picked up Raging Heart on 
it&#39;s special chain and hung it around her neck. She didn&#39;t expect to 
need it, but she wanted to be ready.

&quot;When should I tell them you&#39;ll be back?&quot; Miyuki asked, smiling as 
Nanoha hurried back down stairs.

Nanoha paused at the door as she slipped a set of dress shoes on. &quot;Not 
till later,&quot; she said with a smile, &quot;I&#39;ll phone if I&#39;m really late.&quot;

&quot;Have fun,&quot; Miyuki nodded as Nanoha left. Quietly she murmured to 
herself, &quot;Looks like my little sister is all grown up.&quot;

Meanwhile, the nightclub Arisugawa&#39;s Locket was already jumping. A line 
up of young women waited , talking together and gathering together in 
the spring chill. Signum Needes looked cool and composed in a simple 
pants and jacket combo, her pink hair flowing down over her shoulders in 
a ponytail. Beside her Shamal smiled in her long dress, her blonde hair 
framing kind eyes as she talked to Ishida, the other woman casually 
standing close by. Not far away Hayate Yagami and Vita talked, both 
young women laughing softly. The three Wolkenritter covertly positioned 
themselves to guard Hayate and Ishida, though a casual observer might 
not have noticed.

&quot;I still find all of it hard to accept,&quot; Ishida admitted as they 
continued their conversation, &quot;thought learning about the magic 
explained a great deal.&quot; She gave all of them a scolding look and added, 
&quot;Like why medicine wouldn&#39;t help Hayate.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not all their fault,&quot; Hayate spoke up for them, her brown hair 
falling into her large eyes, &quot;they didn&#39;t know my illness was caused by 
the book.&quot;

Shamal put her hand on Ishida&#39;s shoulder as she smiled at her warmly, 
&quot;And if it hadn&#39;t been for that we&#39;d never have met.&quot;

Ishida blushed under her loving gaze even as Vita rolled her eyes. 
&quot;Mushy stuff,&quot; the little girl muttered under her breath, shaking her 
head as her red braid bounced. &quot;Too bad Zafira can&#39;t come,&quot; she added.

&quot;I understand men are forbidden here,&quot; Signum noted coolly, looking 
around them at the many women warily. Around her neck her sword amulet 
dangled, much like the ones her comrades Shamal and Vita had.

&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to this,&quot; Hayate agreed, a smile teasing her lips. 
There was a interesting aura between her and her three knights, a sense 
of tenderness and caring. She poked Signum lightly, &quot;You could relax a 
bit.&quot;

Signum gave her a amused look, &quot;This is me relaxed.&quot;

A redheaded woman stood by the door, checking identification with a 
cheerful smile. Midori Sugiura nodded to the group of them, looking them 
over. She frowned at Hayate and Vita, &quot;Can I see your IDs?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m immortal,&quot; Vita grumbled with a sigh, &quot;and I&#39;ll get carded 
forever.&quot;

Hayate nodded to Midori as she explained, &quot;I&#39;m underage, but I&#39;m being 
escorted by my friends.&quot; Wryly she added, &quot;I&#39;m sure they have no 
intention of letting me drink.&quot;

&quot;You may be our master,&quot; Shamal noted with a smile, &quot;but drinking is 
very bad for someone your age.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Ishida agreed.

After going down a short hallway they were met by a smiling young woman 
&quot;Welcome to Arisugawa&#39;s Locket,&quot; Alpha smiled, the green haired coffee 
shop owner having taken up greeting duties that day.

Meanwhile, in a apartment in another part of Tokyo a blonde haired woman 
fretted as she turned back and forth in front of the mirror. &quot;Does this 
look good, Bardiche?&quot; Fate Testarossa Harlaown finally asked, looking as 
her black pants and jacket, all trimmed in gold.

&quot;You look fine, Sir,&quot; Bardiche answered with his usual formality, the 
triangle shaped device sitting on the dresser nearby. While his voice 
was as calm and even as normal, there was a bit of bemusement in his 
voice, too. Clearly, it was a new experience for the intelligent device 
to be asked for fashion advice.

&quot;You&#39;ll knock `em dead,&quot; Aruf added cheerfully, the red furred puppy 
laying comfortably on Fate&#39;s bed. She also sounded rather amused at 
seeing this more hesitant side of Fate, though also just a bit sad too.

&quot;They&#39;re right,&quot; the other woman&#39;s voice noted, her tone kind. A 
startled Fate turned to see Lindy Harlaown looking at her with a slight 
smile, the green haired woman adding, &quot;I came up to remind you it&#39;s 
nearly time to go.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Mother&quot; Fate said with a little blush as she picked up 
Bardiche and put it in a inner pocket of her jacket.

Lindy walked over to put a comforting hand on Fate&#39;s shoulder as she 
said, &quot;You really don&#39;t need to be nervous, Fate.&quot;

Fate gave her adopted mother a sad smile as she explained, &quot;After Nanoha 
got hurt, I realized I needed to let her know how I feel.&quot; She sighed as 
she added, &quot;But this is our first date, and I&#39;m terrified it won&#39;t go 
well....&quot;

Lindy surprised her with a hug, then let her go. &quot;She loves you,&quot; she 
told Fate firmly, &quot;it&#39;ll be all right.&quot;

Fate blushed then she quickly hugged Lindy back. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said 
then turned to the door, &quot;and I&#39;d better get going.&quot;

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Lindy called as Fate went outside, activated Bardiche and 
soared off into the evening sky. &quot;You two belong together,&quot; Lindy 
murmured to herself as she closed the door, &quot;though it took you long 
enough to realize it.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s a bit slow that way,&quot; Aruf agreed with a sigh. She looked up at 
Lindy, &quot;Wanna get the usual suspects together for cards?&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Lindy laughed, her and the puppy heading out to the 
livingroom together.

At almost the same time Nanoha smiled as she hurried up to the bar, 
coming up behind another of her close friends, both in and out of 
school. Suzuka Tsukimura turned, her purple hair shining as she hugged 
Nanaho and said, &quot;I thought you&#39;d never get here.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Nanaho chuckled, &quot;I tried to hurry but I didn&#39;t want to use 
magic to get here.&quot; She looked a bit nervous, &quot;Is Fate here?&quot;

Suzuka looked up, her eyes widening as she said, &quot;I think that&#39;s her 
now.&quot;

Shimmering gold wings glowed on Fate&#39;s boots as she descended from the 
sky, her expression rather sheepish as she landed out of sight nearby. 
&quot;Sorry,&quot; she said as she hurried out of the alley, the wings 
disappearing and Bardiche&#39;s scythe mode reverting to a amulet.

&quot;I thought we weren&#39;t going to use magic,&quot; Nanoha scolded even as she 
rushed to hug Fate close to her.

Fate let her arms wrap around Nanoha, holding her close tenderly even as 
she felt the love she carried for her well up from deep inside. &quot;Sorry,&quot; 
she repeated with a lopsided smile.

Suzuka laughed softly as she said, &quot;You two are making a scene.&quot; She 
smiled as she gently added, &quot;Can we please head inside?&quot;

&quot;Lets,&quot; Nanoha agreed, keeping a arm around Fate.

Within the bar women chatted and danced together happily, swaying to the 
pounding beat of the music. Off to one side of the most unusual bar the 
library was filled with people reading and talking, while up at the main 
bar women vied for the attention of the bartenders and posed prettily 
for each other.

Hitomi smiled as the brown haired part time waitress lead the three to 
the table their friends were at. &quot;I hope you&#39;ll have a good time,&quot; she 
said warmly, &quot;just signal a waitress if you need anything.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Fate nodded happily.

&quot;Suzuka,&quot; Hayate cried as she looked up happily, getting up to draw the 
other woman close to her. They kissed a bit shyly under the other&#39;s 
gazes, then Suzuka drew her close, kissing her a bit more eagerly.

&quot;I&#39;ve missed you,&quot; Suzuka sighed happily as they finally parted.

Hayate blushed a bit, her gaze tender and loving. &quot;I&#39;m sorry my work has 
been keeping me away,&quot; she apologized as they all sat down.

Suzuka put her hand over Hayate&#39;s, squeezing it softly. &quot;I understand, 
Hayate, believe me,&quot; she said softly.

&quot;It&#39;s hard to believe this started from a few library meetings,&quot; Signum 
noted as they greeted their friends.

&quot;Thanks for saving us a table,&quot; Nanoha said, sitting down beside Fate on 
one end, the couple of Shamal and Ishida, Vita and Signum then Hayate 
and Suzuka.

They talked happily and ate eagerly, drinking cautiously and taking 
turns to get up and go out on the dance floor. Shamal and Ishida swayed 
together gracefully while Suzuka and Hayate danced more energetically. 
Surprisingly Signum was approached by several ladies and danced, even as 
Vita scowled in her seat.

&quot;It&#39;s size discrimination,&quot; Vita growled irritably, crossing her arms 
over her chest.

Signum patted her on the shoulder as she wryly suggested, &quot;You could 
always use disguise magic.&quot;

Meanwhile, back at the ranch Yuuno Scrya rather desperately looked at 
his cards. &quot;I&#39;ll take a card?&quot; the brown haired boy sighed.

&quot;Here you go,&quot; Aruf smiled, now in her busty redheaded form.

Zafira frowned as he studied Aruf and Lindy. &quot;What am I doing here?&quot; the 
heavily muscled blue haired man sighed.

&quot;Because short of a sex change you weren&#39;t getting in there?&quot; Lindy 
offered as she drew a card. She brightened noticeably, &quot;I raise.&quot;

&quot;Fold,&quot; Yuuno sighed as he tossed down his cards. Muttering under his 
breath he added, &quot;I hope Nanoha and the others are having a better time 
than I am.&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

&quot;More food?&quot; Mahoro asked, the black haired android dressed in a typical 
black and white maid&#39;s uniform. &quot;Drink refills?&quot;

&quot;Not for me,&quot; Nanoha said as she got up, turning and offering Fate her 
hand. &quot;Would you like to dance?&quot; she asked eagerly.

&quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Fate answered as she let Nanoha pull her to her feet, the 
two walking out to the dance floor. &quot;Nanoha,&quot; Fate murmured as they slow 
danced. She swallowed, summoning her courage, &quot;I&#39;ve wanted to sat this 
to you for a long time... I love you.&quot;

Nanoha let her head rest on Fate&#39;s shoulder, &quot;I&#39;ve loved you almost as 
long as I&#39;ve known you, fate.&quot;

&quot;Will you.... be with me? Forever?&quot; Fate asked as she looked down at 
Nanoha.

&quot;Always,&quot; Nanoha agreed, kissing her again, tenderly.

End

The Staff of Arisugawa&#39;s Locket: Midori Sugiura is from Mai Hime, Mahoro 
is from Mahororomantic and Alpha is from Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou.

Notes: This is a somewhat expanded chapter from Arisugawa&#39;s Locket, a 
fanfic about a cross dimensional lesbian bar. Couplings of the Nanoha 
cast are part canon, part based on my reading of characters. Suzuka &amp; 
Hayate seemed possible from how close they were in A&#39;s, tho it 
contradicts my other possible coupling of Suzuka and Arisa. Heh. Shamal 
and Doctor Ishida struck me as a `possible&#39; watching them together in 
A&#39;s, tho I admit it&#39;s a stretch.</pre>
