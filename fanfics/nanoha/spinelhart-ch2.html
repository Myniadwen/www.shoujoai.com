<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I loved mornings like this most of all.  The sun wasn't quite up yet but it was still trying, spraying wisp of  orange through the sky as the night's darkness faded. Birds were  already singing their morning songs and it occurred to me that the  military base back home had no such thing. Oh well, such was life I  suppose. Right now nothing could get my spirits down, as I was still  on cloud nine from last night's encounter. Fate had accepted me,  after making me worry all evening, and was now my girlfriend. Vivio  had two mothers who were actually together now instead of just  friends, and I still had time with my own family as well. The smell  of coffee made me inhale deeply, feeling a bittersweet nostalgic  moment of growing up to the scent every morning. Personally I hated  the stuff, but the smell still screamed out 'morning' to me. Seeing  as how the café was closed today I just assumed that my  parents forgot to turn off the timer today. Disregarding the machine  I continued making breakfast for myself and Fate. Bacon was cooked,  toast was buttered with jam, and the eggs were just coming off the  skillet. With a smile I arranged the plate and poured a rather large  cup of orange juice to share before turning to walk back to my room  and stopped in my tracks when I saw me blonde friend standing in the  doorway.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By: Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw,”  Nanoha pouted at her as she made her way towards the door leading  into the living room. “I was going to surprise you with breakfast  in bed.” Her friend looked pleasantly shocked at the notion and  apologized with a small lopsided grin. “Oh well, come eat.”  Sitting down, Nanoha scooped up a forkful of the scrambled eggs. “I  was going to make an omelet but we had a small disagreement.”  Moving to her friend, she fed the red eyed one the bite. “I thought  my eggs should fold over onto themselves but they thought they should  fall apart in my pan. Unfortunately I lost the argument.” With a  sheepish grin she watched Fate silently laugh with her eyes. “Did  you sleep well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Better  than I have in a long, long time.” She admitted the truth with a  small splash of color across her nose. “I slept like a rock, and  for once you didn't keep me up snoring like normal when you fall  asleep first.” Her tease met it's mark and Nanoha stiffened  slightly. Everyone knew she could wake the dead with her snoring and  she was hyper sensitive about the subject, even going as far as  getting special strips to put across her nose at night to help stop  the habit. Although they didn't work in the slightest Fate lied to  Nanoha for a good three nights just to see how cute she looked with  the small band across the middle of her face. “A good night's rest  was just what I needed,” She knew to change the topic before the  tease had time to upset the girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  nodded slightly to herself and took turns feeding her friend while  eating as well. “So, um... last night was...” She fed Fate again  to buy herself some time to come up with the words she wanted to use.  “Fun?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  blonde laughed happily at the embarrassed comment and had to cover  her mouth to make sure she didn't accidentally spit the food she was  just fed onto her friend. “Yes,” She agreed finally, laughter  still evident in her voice. “Fun.”  The two locked eyes for a  brief moment before each turned away shyly, their first make-out  session still fresh on their minds. “Um, Thanks for breakfast.”  One hand went to sweep a lock of hair behind her ear before leaning  back onto the large couch while Nanoha sat the empty plate on the  table. Shortly after she found Nanoha embarrassedly scooting closer,  pressing up against her side enough to warrant having an arm placed  around her shoulders. “It's odd,” Fate whispered as her gaze  turned to the shorter girl curled up against her. Nanoha's eyes  blinked in question at her statement so she developed deeper on it.  “We've done this countless times before but this time it's  different.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,”  Nanoha nodded slightly. “I guess our relationship did change just a  little bit, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I...don't  mind.” Fate's hand rubbed her girlfriend's shoulder lightly. “It's  nice.” Any reply she may have gotten was cut off by a soft yawn.  “Hehe, you still sleepy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  little. Slept great but just didn't get enough I guess. Yesterday as  an emotional day for me you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well  then, just rest a little bit longer.” Fate shifted slightly away  from her friend and laid back on the couch. “Come on,” she  prompted softly with a smile. Nanoha looked at her for a moment  before smiling shyly and laying down on top of her friend. “There  you go, get a few more minutes of sleep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Someone  could catch us,” She reminded softly while getting comfortable. Her  head rested above Fate's breasts and under her chin, arms looped  around under her body and palms pressings against the blonde's back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's  fine, no one will be up for a bit.” Fate pulled the comforter off  the back of the couch and laid it out over their bodies to keep warm.  She felt rather than saw Nanoha nod against her and placed both her  arms around her friend. Instead of a word of goodnight Nanoha simply  placed a very small kiss onto Fate's neck, prompting an embarrassed  sound in return. It didn't take long before the breathing of the girl  on top to become steady, lightly tickling Fate's neck whenever her  partner would exhale a little harder than normal. For once she didn't  snore, instead blissfully sighing in her dreams. The mood started to  seep into the blonde as well and instead of watching TV while Nanoha  slept, she too soon fell asleep.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mama?”  Vivio's voice slowly made Fate open her eyes and look sleepily to the  side. “Good morning.” Vivio greeted properly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good  morning...” Fate spoke softly, still more asleep than awake. One  hand went to rub her eyes slowly. “What time is it sweetheart?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Almost  noon, you lazy bum!” Arisa's voice made Fate gasp, looking up into  the eyes of her Earth friend. “I see you and Nanoha <em>do</em> still  cling to each other every moment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  looked around, realizing that all of her friends and family were  already moving about. “Ah! We over slept!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nnghh...”  Nanoha looked up slowly towards Fate. “Fate-chan... G'mornin  again...” She smiled sleepily at her friend while weakly moving  forward. “Can I have a kiss?” Her words were broken, not fully  awake yet. Missing Fate's nervous whispering she still planted a  gentle good morning greeting on her girlfriend's lips. “Mmm...”  Pulling back she smiled playfully down at her friend, rubbing sleep  from her eyes. “Always wanted to do the good morning kiss thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whoa-ho!”  Arisa exclaimed loudly, pointing at them in shock. “You <em>are</em> dating! I knew it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Arisa!” Nanoha fell off the couch quickly and almost landed on  Vivio in the process. “Suzuka! Everyone!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are they awake finally?” Chrono bent over the couch to look at  them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vivio looked up happily. “Uncle Chrono!” With a hop she jumped  onto the couch and then onto Fate's stomach. The blonde gasped out in  slight pain as Chrono picked up the little girl. “Hello!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello to you too.” He held her against his hip and grinned down  at his sister. “So, sis, got a girlfriend and didn't even tell us?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  blushed darkly. “Um, in all fairness, it <em>just</em> happened.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Arisa laughed. “Oh please, you two have been dating since you were  ten, you just didn't know it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sweetheart, cut them some slack.” Suzuka put a hand one the  other girl's shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Sweetheart!?</em>”  Fate pointed at them. “What the hell? And you yell at <em>me</em> for not delivering news?!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nice!” Nanoha hugged them both. “Wow, birds of a feather, huh?  What're the odds we'd all end up together? Sounds like a bad plot on  a rushed fanfic, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At that moment Hayate decided to enter the room through the front  door. “Happy Halloween everyone!” In her arms she carried several  bags filled with what appeared to be clothes. In turn she herself was  decked out in a stereotypical witch outfit complete with a broom. “I  brought your costumes!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hayate!” The room greeted all at the same time. Several hugs  were issued around in greeting as her body guard knights followed  into the house.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Talk about cramped,” Nanoha mused as her mother dragged her off  to help serve drinks for the many, many guest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“C'mere Fate-chan!” Hayate motioned  for the blonde first and held out a bag. “Here's your treat!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate slowly looked into the bag and  stared a few moments before looking back up with a horrified  expression. “You can't be serious.” Hayate's smile only got  larger. “Hayate, I'm going to murder you in your sleep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Glad you like it!” The leader  didn't seem phased by the death threat. “Now go change, everyone  else needs to as well!” Shooing the girl up the stairs she called  out again. “Vivio! I have one for you too!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After several minutes of chaotic  greetings and passing out of uniforms Nanoha once again came into to  living room bearing several cups of ice. Following was her mother  with several bottles of drinks and her father with plates of  different types of cakes, cookies, and other snacks. Vivio was the  first to run up to help and relieved Nanoha of two of the cups before  carrying them the rest of the way to the group and handing them out.  The little girl then smiled brightly at her accomplishment before  gasping out loudly and pointing to the stairs. “Mama's a kitty!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha looked over to where her  daughter was pointing and grinned from ear to ear at the sight. Fate  was in something that looked like a solid black one piece bathing  suit paired with knee high skin tight black leggings. From her elbows  down the same skin hugging material covered her arms to fingertips.  The only difference was the palms of her hands and bottoms of her  feet were a blindingly cute shade of pink. To top off the outfit she  had on a cat-ear headband and a long tail that swung out behind her  seemingly on it's own. “Me-yow!” Nanoha cheered at her, clapping  along with everyone else. “Here kitty, kitty, kitty!” She made a  beckoning motion with her hand. “Heeeeeeeere kitty, kitty!”  Despite the laughing Fate still made her way over to her friend and  gave the blue eyed girl a pathetically embarrassed look. “Good  girl!” Nanoha comforted, petting her hair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh stow it.” Fate shoved a bag  into Nanoha's arms. “Here is your's and Vivio's, go change.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure thing, we'll go right meow.”  Nanoha darted away from her girlfriend before the pun had time to  register and scooped up Vivio on her way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate talked idly with her friends while  ignoring the repeated cat calls from those waiting to change into  costumes for Halloween. Subaru simply wore floppy puppy ears and a  matching short tail that wagged out behind her whenever she laughed  or smiled. Tia simply wore her barrier jacket and claimed that she  was 'in uniform' when Hayate requested her to change into something  more fitting. Despite her best protest the leader couldn't deny that  a military outfit, on Earth, <em>was</em> indeed dressing up. Finally after what seemed like fifteen long  minutes Nanoha's voice sprang up again from the stairway. “Ladies  and gentlemen, boys and girls, The star of Girls Gone Wild parts two,  five, and seven... Nanoha Takamachi!” With that she jumped into  view wearing the standard playboy bunny playmate outfit. Tight sheer  white leggings graced her lower half with black heeled shoes. Her  body was covered in a red outfit that showed generous cleavage and  even had a mini neck-tie and cuff. On her rear was a cute fluffy  bunny tail that she could wiggle when shaking her hips and her head  appeared to have two large floppy bunny ears with no visible headband  holding them on. “Jaaaaaaaaaan!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate clapped the  loudest of all, sticking two fingers in her mouth and letting out a  shrill whistle. “Looking good!” Nudging Fate, she grinned. “Say  something!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have never  been more turned on nor embarrassed in my entire life...” Fate  whispered to herself, face burning red. “Hayate, I forgive you for  everything you've put me through.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  also introducing, puppy!Vivio!” Nanoha reached onto the stairs and  encouraged Vivio to come forward into the crowd. The small one had  white dog ears on her head with black spots on them as well as a full  body outfit that resembled a dalmatian. Face paint dotted her skin  with black dots as well as a matching tail that was wagging insanely  fast as people cooed over her. “Hayate-chan,” Nanoha motioned for  her. “How in the world do these outfits work? I swear I can <em>feel</em> my ears!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'd break it  down but as far as I know, they have some type of stimulating micro  chip thingy-ma-jigger that reads your emotions and reacts to them.  Ask Yuuno for a more detailed explination.” Hayate grinned,  observing the outfit. “You look better in that than I thought!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,”  Nanoha accepted the random offering of a cookie from her sister and  looked around merrily. “Wow, this is turning into quite a show. Did  you bring anything for Suzuka and Arisa?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate nodded as  they walked to the couch to talk. “A leopard outfit for Arisa and a  squirrel for Suzuka.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You sure you're  not a closet fur-fan?” Nanoha laughed loudly at the blush she  received but had to bite it down when Raising Heart beeped at her to  signal a communication's window.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!” the  screen greeted her quickly. “It's almost lunch time, where are  you!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The image of the  instuctor's superior graced the screen, making the girl gasp out.  “Oh! I'm so sorry!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Save it, and get  here!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha looked over  at Fate who had Vivio in her lap. The blond smiled fondly at her,  obviously holding back her words. The look was encouraging but sad at  the same time. “I'm sorry,” Nanoha spoke again to the screen. “I  can't come today.” Her superior gave her a blank shocked look a  moment, giving Nanoha enough time to explain. “I'm with my family  and friends right now... I just can't leave, I'm taking my daughter  out tonight and going to a party.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see... Well, you <em>are</em> on vacation under orders from your direct superior so I can't force  you...” She sighed loudly. “Family first, I understand. Have  fun.” The screen blipped out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha...”  Fate looked over at her gently. “...Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The bunny-girl  whined out loudly before stuffing the rest of her cookie into her  mouth to get her mind off what she had just done. “There's always  next year!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who are you and  what have you done with Nanoha?” Hayate laughed out while moving  out of the way for Vivio to run across the room and hug the legs of  her other mother.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“I'm glad it's not too cold,” Fate  mused as she walked down the street with the large group of friends.  “I was a little worried about that.” Looking up at the sky she  grinned at the sun. “We probably have about an hour or two left of  daylight so we can get quite a few houses.” In front of her Vivio,  Elio, Caro, and a reluctant Vita were all talking between themselves.  Elio appeared to be a knight straight out of a
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">a Final Fantasy game while Caro was  decked out in a large frilly pink princess dress. Vita was the only  scary one of the group, earing a pitch black cape and a dark maroon  and black suit. Her K-9 teeth were expanded and after a touch of  make-up she made the perfect little vampire.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah well, if it was we could have  just taken the van around.” Nanoha waved it off, stopping at the  sidewalk and watching the group of children run up to a house and  ring the doorbell. “Brings back memories doesn't it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate smiled as she thought back. “I  remember; back then you two pushed me around in my wheelchair to all  the houses. It was my first time trick-or-treating... Fate-chan's too  wasn't it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,” Fate nodded. “Nanoha made  such a big fuss over it.” After re-grouping with their little ones  they walked a little farther to the next batch of houses. “She  tried to show me how to carve a pumpkin but we ended up having to let  Hayate do it for us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou!” Nanoha wrinkled up her nose,  bunny ears standing up straight. “You don't have to tease me,  Kitty-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate's tail picked up it's pace swaying  behind her lightly. “Stop calling me that, it's embarrassing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate swapped to walking in between  them, looping an arm through their's. “Now now we can flirt later,  right now let's just have fun.” Her teasing made each of them blush  and turn and look away, still not used to people acknowledging them  as a couple. “Hey, you girls...what say we trick-or-treat with  them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?” Nanoha blinked. “Arn't we a  little old for that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh come on!” Hayate grinned  widely. “Let's do it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate slowly smiled. “Okay, sure, for  old times sake.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou, you two!” Nanoha ran ahead of  them, grabbing Elio's offered treat bag. “Such children!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Says the one the most eager!”  Hayate darted forward as well, followed closely by Fate. Together the  three ran up to a house and rang the doorbell, giggling to themselves  when the door opened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Trick-or-treat!” the three of them  got odd looks but still received candy before running back to the  younger ones while laughing at their selves.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wow! Babes at thee oclock!” A new  voice sprang up, making everyone turn to a group of guys dressed up  as Earth monsters. “Hello there ladies. How about coming to a party  with us after you're through babysitting?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate flushed. “Are they hitting on  us?” She whispered over to Nanoha shyly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,” Fate waved at them. “We're  already going to another party.” She turned to walk off but the  guys danced in front of them before she could.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw come on kitty-kitty!” One of  the men put a hand on Fate's bare shoulder. “I can make you purr.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha's face darkened. “Look, a  ghost!” She pointed frantically, making the younger kids turn to  inspect the area. A loud thwacking sound made everyone turn back to  see Nanoha shaking her hand lightly and two of the guys picking up  the one who had touched Fate off of the ground. “I guess I was  seeing things, nyahaha.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My nose...” The guy whimpered as  his buddies helped him stagger away. “I...I think it's broken!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate laughed nervously, trying to  shoo the children to another house. “Nanoha-chan's a little  protective...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,” She apologized to Fate  shyly. “I'm... kind of the jealous type...” Fate in turn only  gave her an amused, incredulous look.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“I still can't get over it.” Subaru  mused as she walked around the many people she didn't know at the  party. “They're all...acting like normal girls.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia glanced over to the group of three  Aces who were currently playing a game of Twister along with Arisa  and Suzuka. “Yeah... it's a little unnerving. I keep expecting our  instructor to bark out commands or something.” Her words broke near  the end when Hayate and Nanoha ended up being in a rather provocative  position. Fate was laughing loudly at it but soon found herself  falling down because of it, taking Arisa with her. Just as well, the  blonde had to answer the door when a loud knocking came up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey!” Arisa greeted Chrono and  Yuuno. “I told you boys already. No costume, no party!” She  grinned at them. Chrono had a plastic Wal-Mart bag looped behind his  ears and covering his hair while Yuuno had a brown paper bag over his  head with holes cut out so he could see. “Nice try, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We are in costume!” Chrono  declared.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? And who are you supposed to be?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We,” Yuuno stated as he struck a  pose. “Are the bag brothers! Paper!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chrono matched his pose, only  inversely. “And Plastic! Together, fighting for the rights of  containers everywhere!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Arisa gave them a blank look.  “I'm...not sure if I'm impressed or very saddened by this...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Can we come in?” Chrono asked  after a moment, clearly starting to get embarrassed now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come on,” Arisa moved to the side  and put a hand on her hip, allowing them access. “Dorks.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The game of twister finally ended with  no winner, leaving the girls in a tangled heap on the floor. Hayate,  after helping Suzuka up, smiled brightly. “Oh! I almost forgot!”  She looked over at Yuuno and trotted over to him. “Did you find out  yet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Yuuno pulled his 'costume'  back so he could talk to her. “I just got it confirmed, along with  Nanoha's family, Arisa and Suzuka can have passports to visit  Mid-Childa. They can only come when accompanied by either you or  myself, though. No free-teleportation...as if they could anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're the best!” Hayate hugged  him in the spur of the moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just remember, we had to say that  they are Nanoha's cousins to make it legal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.” She nodded and turned back  to her group of friends. “Everyone! We have some big news!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're pregnant!” Nanoha instantly  yelled out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What!?” Hayate's startled cry was  drowned out by the sudden applause and cheering around them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?” Yuuno blushed darkly, almost  dropping his drink.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Congratulations!” Tia cheered our  while clapping.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're a great couple!” Subaru  added in loudly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate took a step forward and brought  up her hands. “Um, n-no, that isn't...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wow!” Fate grabbed Hayate's hands  and squeezed them. “I never knew you had gotten so far!  Congratulations! Wow, you hid it really well, no one had any idea you  two were even dating!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dating!?” Yuuno almost choked,  glaring at Nanoha who seemed as if she just won the teacher of the  year award for the chaos she had just caused. “C'mere you!” he  darted forward and grabbed Nanoha around the waist, lifting her and  draping her over his shoulder. “You set this straight right now!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kyaa!” Nanoha laughed out happily.  “Help me, help me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate was still waving her hands,  trying to get everyone to calm down.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“What a night,” Fate spoke softly  to Nanoha when they entered their room. “I can't believe we partied  until three in the morning...”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well we have to go home in seven  hours,” Nanoha sighed sadly. “Man, I feel homesick already and I  haven't even left.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate hugged her friend lightly. “There  there, you heard Hayate. They can come visit us now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,” Nanoha looked up at Fate and  smiled. “You're right. This is our last night here, let's make the  best of it. We can have post-vacation depression once we're back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right,” Fate's cheeks colored when  she wasn't let go of. “Um... Nanoha?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmmm?” She smiled gently, her  bunny ears getting floppy again to reflect her serine mood. “Can I  not hold you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate stammered out embarrassedly before  giving in and allowing herself to be embraced longer. “I'm just...  still a little shy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha giggled. “I'm too happy to be  shy right now.” Moving up, she touched their noses. “Can I kiss  you, if you don't mind?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“D-don't <em>ask</em>.”  Fate protested, cheeks darkening even more. “J-just... do it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,” Nanoha  titled her head slightly and pressed her lips against Fate's. The  kiss ended slowly but another picked up again right after it. Her  hands trailed the lightly furry suit Fate was wearing until she  gripped the base of the tail.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“N-Nanoha...Again...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” Her lips  were getting a little more aggressive. “I want to be sure,”  Another kiss. “I'm not dreaming.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“B-but...” Yet  another long kiss. “We should,” a very long deep kiss.  “...sleep...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha grinned,  gently touching Fate's butt in a bold move. “Your lips say no,”  She whispered softly. “But your tail says yes.” The long add-on  of Fate's was spasticaly flinching behind the blonde.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Damn Hayate,”  Fate started the next kiss, purring low in her throat when she was  embraced and gave into Nanoha's desires.</span></p>
