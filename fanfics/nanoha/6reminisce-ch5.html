<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The sound  the scissors made me cringe as they cut through my hair. I know it was  stupid but I couldn't help but close my eyes tightly and grip my fist  in an attempt to stay still while allowing Shamal to finish trimming  for me. Even though she has trimmed my hair for as long as I can  remember, scissors and I have never gotten along. I whimpered softly  when another snips made hair fall across my face and Shamal giggled to  herself and gently blew on me, making the hair fly away from my eyes.  She made some comment about how I never really grew up at all but I  ignored it and continued to try and keep myself steady. Truthfully I  wanted to scream and run away, to keep as much hair as I could, but I  knew this had to be done. My hair looked dreadful after the last  mission, some going to the middle of my back while most was just past  shoulder length. I won't deny that I cried last night when I took a  shower. I know it was childish and there were more important things to  be thinking about, but I had been growing my hair for as long as I had  been alive. I had managed to get it to my knees, something I had  originally tried to do for Nanoha. When we were younger she said that  it would be ' the neatest thing ever' if I managed to get it long  enough to reach my knees so me, being easily influenced back then, said  I would do it for her. I guess after all the years I just kept on,  getting it trimmed only when it decided to stop growing on me. Honestly  I loved it when Nanoha touched my hair, it felt so soothing and  calming. Actually that was how she first seduced me, rubbing my back  and playing with my hair until I was in bliss, then kissed me. My eyes  closed tighter when Shamal stepped back from me and observed. After  several seconds she declared that she was done and placed a mirror in  my hand. I did not want to open my eyes at all but I slowly managed to  meekly open one of them to see what I had left of my beloved hair.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By: Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  slowly opened her eyes and looked into the large mirror in front of  her. So far not much looked like it changed save for the normal two  sections that stayed in front of her shoulders looked a little shorter  than they used to be. After a deep breath she turned around and held up  the mirror in her hand to look behind herself and see what the back  looked like in the large mirror. She had lost a good three and a half  feet of her hair, now only having it go a few inches past her  shoulders. Shamal had managed to make it into a 'V' shape still, giving  her the illusion of having it down to almost the middle of her back.  “Well,” Fate spoke a little shakingly. “It's not as bad as I thought it  would be...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You've always had abnormally thick hair, so I tired  to keep as much length as I could by just thinning it out some... Is it  okay?” Shamal looked rather nervous, as she should. If anyone besides  her touched Fate's hair in an attempt to cut it they would probably  receive the same wrath as if they touched her car. “It will grow back  faster than it took to grow it already long, I promise.” She put her  hands on Fate's shoulders. “I can get you some shampoo that's supposed  to make your hair grow faster too...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Fate sighed out. “Thank you Shamal, it looks much better than I thought it would...Do you have anything for a headache?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  just one second.” She hurried over to a cabinet and took out a bottle.  “Does your scalp still hurt? Do you want some pain killers? You're  lucky you got out of that with only a loss in hair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't  remind me,” She rubbed her head. “And yes, please, I hurt really bad. I  think my back is nothing but one large bruise.” Fate took the offered  pills and water, taking them quickly. “I'm so glad Hayate lets us take  a day off after a mission to re cooperate, I'd go crazy if I had to sit  at my desk all day today.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you want me to write you a doctor's excuse for another day?” Shamal looked at her nervously. “You need to rest okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  smiled at her, placing the mirror on the table and hopping out of her  chair. Shamal always seemed to treat her like a little sister, probably  because of how close Hayate and her were. “I'll be okay after today,  thank you.” With a light bow she said her goodbye. “Nanoha is waiting  for me to go shopping so I must be off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Take care,” Shamal waved at her after giving a bottle of pills.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  made her way to her loft quickly, ignoring the gasp and questioning  glances of the people who noticed her hair cut. Her stomach growled at  her when she entered the mess hall but she decided to eat out with  Nanoha instead when they were in town. The elevator opened up and  allowed her entrance but stopped on the fifth floor, opening up to  reveal Tia and Subaru in the middle of what appeared to be in the  middle of a very deep kiss. “Captain on the deck!” She barked out,  making the two instantly pull apart and stand at attention, saluting.  The two looked at her for a moment before Tia leaned forward.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Fate-...san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate blushed darkly. “Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh wow, it looks great!”  Subaru hopped in the elevator next to her and circled the girl. “I like it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's  the same... just shorter...” She looked down, going into embarrassment  mode when they started complimenting her. Reaching up, she brushed some  of her hair that fell over her shoulder back behind her ear and  realized all at once that it was probably going to become a habit. When  the door opened again she stepped out into the hallway and waved at  them lightly, getting saluted once more. “I'm home,” She greeted softly  as she walked into her loft. “You ready, Nanoha?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Almost,” She  replied absently, squinting a little as she looked at the monitor in  front of her. “Let me finish the details about Caro's new dragon into  the report so she won't have to repeat her story a million times...  Fate please move,” She looked up when her lover literally stood in  between her monitor display. “ I can't see.” The look she received told  her that was the very point Fate was trying to make. With a sigh she  gave her the cutest pout she could muster. “But Faaaaateeeeee.” The  girl didn't let up so she reluctantly reached over into her purse and  pulled out her glasses case and slid them on. “There. Happy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,”  Fate leaned forward and kissed her forehead. “I'm going upstairs right  fast, can you send that to Bardiche for me when you're done?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh  wait, let me see your hair!” Nanoha motioned for her to turn around and  smiled when she reluctantly did so. “It looks cute, you're a few years  younger.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't <em>want</em> to look younger,” She groaned out and put her palm to her face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Meep,  sorry.” Nanoha clearly didn't mean it; instead she was smiling up at  her merrily. “It's still really cute though. Going to leave it short or  grow it again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Which would you prefer?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha stuck out her tongue. “Its <em>your</em> hair.” Fate continued to look at her so she put her hand to her chin  and thought. “Well, if it's short it won't tangle with mine so much  when we sleep or make love together...But then again I really like it  longer too...Mou, I don't know! Pick one and go with it, Fate is Fate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Long  then,” the blond reached behind herself and gripped the hair to begin  pulling it all together. “I could go with a ponytail in a few months...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,” Nanoha started typing again, going much faster once everything was in focus. “As long as I can play with it still.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  did you want to go shopping today of all days?” Fate asked while  walking to the stairs, ignoring that last comment. “Normally you use  time after missions to catch up on your paper work and plan your  upcoming week.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because...” Nanoha sighed. “I'm going to have to leave for a few days tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What, why?” Fate looked over at her while changing into civilian clothing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Training.”  Nanoha stood up and stretched before walking over to the stairs and up  to her fiancée. “Vita-chan and I were called in by the training forces  for a week long training session.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw... Its been ages since you've been called back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Magic  development has been slow.” She smiled up at her lightly before walking  to their closet and picking out a sweater to wear. “I'll learn a few  new tricks and come back as soon as possible.” With a quick tug she  removed her shirt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate looked over at her sadly, eying the large  bruise that covered half her stomach as well as the smaller ones that  were on her chest. Nanoha smiled at her and covered up, pulling her  ponytail out of the back of her shirt and shaking her head. The blond  looked away after catching a small glimpse of the bruise around her  neck before it was covered with the turtle neck sweater. “Nanoha...  When you get back...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,” She answered before Fate could even finish. “I'll teach you what I learn.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blond gave her an amused look. “What if I was thinking something else?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have I ever finished your sentence with something you wasn't going to say?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well there was a few times that you said:”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But we had sex after it anyway,” Nanoha cut her off. “So it doesn't count.” She gave a peace sign. “I win!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“So  that's what happened...” Hayate leaned back in her chair and looked  over at Yuuno after being told Caro's story. “This new dragon is with  her, right?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kind of,” Yuuno moved his hands while talking.  “Freidliche stays with Caro constantly unless she ask him to leave her  a moment, for when she goes shopping or when Shamal wanted to examine  him to make sure he was in top condition. I think since she didn't have  her dragon with her last mission, another one sought her out. This ice  dragon, Shiva, isn't really friendly.” He brought up a monitor, showing  Shiva sleeping on the top of the building next to the helicopter. “She  stayed with Caro last night in her room but when she went out about her  business, Freidliche followed and Shiva flew away. From what I gather,  Shiva will stay in the immediate vicinity of Caro but not by her side.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see...” Hayate sighed out. “I guess I will have to register her as a  summoned pet and request permission for her flight since she doesn't  seem to want to walk around like Freidliche does... Moving on,” She  brought up a new monitor and waved it over to him. “The AMF Scaglietti  used blocked out observation but Raising Heart and Bardiche were able  to record it as best they could.” She waited a moment as he observed  the battle. “As you can tell, he has created much more powerful AMF  devices, not even Nanoha's best attempt could supply enough force to  last longer than a few seconds, and she's S+.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you have the device?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha smashed it pretty good, but for the most part it's intact. I was wondering if you could look at it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, I was going to ask... With any luck we'll be able to figure something out.” Yuuno nodded to himself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How long do you think it will be before you can find out anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not sure, depends on how hard it is to figure out and how much of it was damaged. A day maybe?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate  leaned back in her chair and smiled. “You're simply amazing. I sent the  data of it to a few people and they said it would take at least a  month.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno blushed lightly and pushed his glasses up on his nose. “Well, I've had a lot of experience...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did  you know people fight over you?” Hayate leaned forward and propped her  elbows on the desk and put her chin in her hands. “A lot of divisions  put in request to have you transferred but since you're not part of  staff they can't get it done. I've been offered quite a lot for your  transfer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh really?” He looked rather amused, but the man's  embarrassment shown through the most. “I guess I'm glad to be in your  hands, then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm.” Hayate smiled at him, making him blush more. “I'm glad you're here as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'll  get started on it,” He stood up quickly and stored the monitors into a  tome like device in his hands. “I'll contact you later okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,”  Hayate walked around her desk and stood in front of him, reaching up to  adjust his glasses to make them straight. “I really appreciate all the  help, Yuuno. You've saved my butt so many times.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We've known each other for half our lives,” He grinned. “It's only natural.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm.” She took a step back and waved at him cutely. “Bye-bye then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bye,” He waved over his shoulder while walking towards the door and leaving through it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmhmmm...” Rein landed on Hayate's head. “You're face is red, Hayate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It is not!” She turned and humped out, returning to her chair. “Stop saying things like that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think you're starting to realize Yuuno is male!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rein,  do your paperwork!” Hayate reached for a pen but ended up knocking her  case of them over onto her desk. “Stop laughing at me, I don't have  time for a man! I have to work on setting up the new staff's budget and  finding Elio, and, and...Stop laughing!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Tia  sat down next to Caro on the edge of the training ground and let her  feet dangle over the side. “Hey there,” She greeted lightly. “Looking  at the sea?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ya know,” Tia kept on, despite getting the  feeling Caro wanted to be alone. “Sitting down and feeling sorry for  yourself never really helps.” The girl looked to the side and offered  the little one next to her an encouraging grin. “Believe me, I've been  there. What you need to do right now isn't wade in your self-doubt but  instead think about the future. We're going to get Elio back, don't  think that we won't. It may take a little time but we're all here for  you. You're not alone, Caro.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The pink haired child nodded to  herself. “I just feel a little empty when he's not near me...” She  turned to look up at her older friend. “At first I was just thinking  about Elio-kun being mine...that he belonged to me...” Her eyes  saddened and diverted. “But now that I saw him with Lutecia-chan, I  feel different. I don't just miss him anymore... I miss the way he  looks at me, I miss touching him, I miss his smile... I miss myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The way he makes you feel?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.” Caro took a breath. “Am I a bad person for that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  jealousy can do weird things to a person.” Tia hummed to herself. “If  you didn't realize it I would say yes, but since you know what you're  missing now I'll go with no. You're not a bad person, Caro. You're  young and dealing with things most people wouldn't have to worry with  for another seven years maybe. If anything, I'm really proud of you.”  Reaching out, she ruffled Caro's hair. “You're only ten and you're  doing the same thing I am, and believe me I know how hard it is. I  don't know how in the world you're not screaming your lungs out, but  I'm really impressed.” She giggled lightly. “Caro, don't forget we're  here with you as well. We will do everything for you, just as you do  everything for us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you.” Caro felt her spirits lift up after the small pep talk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you get all emotionally confused, come to me, I'll listen to anything  you have to say. Nanoha-san said so as well, so I won't feel bad if you  go to her either.” Tia nudged her. “She's your precious 'mommy' isn't  she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes!” She nodded happily, wiping her eyes and giving Tia a hug.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good. Now you need to trot off, Nanoha-san and Fate-san want you to go shopping with them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,” Caro stood up and turned around, seeing Subaru as well. “You're here too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course,” The girl skated over to Caro and knelt down. “But I'm not good  with words at all, so I just let Tia do all the talking. I'm here for  you as well, so come to me too, all right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you!” Caro gave her a hug as well before running off to where the leaders were waiting on her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wow, you're surprisingly good with kids,” Subaru offered a hand to help Tia up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't read anything into it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hehe, If we have children, you're going to be the best mother ever!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia blushed instantly. “We're not having kids!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Relax,  it was a joke!” Subaru grinned at her and skated next to the girl for a  few moments. “...But if we do, you're carrying it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who do you think you're kidding!?!”</span></p>

Nanoha  grinned to herself when she woke up that morning. Fate was next to her,  curled up on her side with her back as close as it could get to her  sleeping partner. Normally the blond always slept against the wall,  only going to sleep after cuddling when her back was pressed against  Nanoha in some way. Carefully the awake girl peeled herself away from  her lover and held her breath when she rolled onto her back. Once she  was sure Fate wasn't going to wake up she slid out the rest of the way  out of the bed and crept over to her dresser, slowly opening the top  drawer. After rooting around her socks for a while she found the one  she wanted and slid a long purple box from it and opened it up to  reveal a gold necklace. The main design was a simple yet elegant three  gem display. A small gold casing with three diamonds hung down on the  gold thread, sparkling brightly in the morning sun. With a smile she  took it from the case before sneaking back to the bed and getting under  the covers. After getting herself in a good position she ever so  carefully laid the diamond part on Fate's chest and moved the necklace  as if it was going across her neck. With that done she quickly leaned  back and closed her eyes, pretending to be asleep.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate groggily  reached up and scratched her chest when she felt something on her. When  her hands touched something she quickly sat up and grabbed it. Once she  calmed down and she realized that it wasn't some sort of bug that  landed on her she opened her hand and gasped out. Her eyes looked at it  for a long time before slowly turning over to Nanoha, who was trying to  keep from smiling and failing miserably. Fate looked at the necklace  one more time before putting it on with shaking hands and then leaning  over her fiancée. “You're not asleep,” She accused, making Nanoha open  her eyes and bite her bottom lip, still grinning. “I love it,” She  continued before Nanoha could ask. “ Let me show you how much...” Her  voice trailed off, kissing Nanoha gently.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Vita growled to herself and stormed down the hallway. '<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">How long is she going to make me wait!?</span></em>' Her mind demanded mentally. '<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We were supposed to meet ten minutes ago!</span></em>'  She reached the door to their loft and knocked loudly on it. “Oi,  Nanoha! Wake up; we need to leave!” A short pause with no answer made  her knock again, much louder. “Nanoha come on!!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“C-coming!” Nanoha's voice screamed out from inside the room. “I'm coming, I'm coming!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vita  crossed her arms and waited, tapping her foot. When nothing happened  she knocked again. “Are you going to go with me or not!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-Yes! Yes! I'm comiiiiing!!!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Vita  looked at the door oddly, wondering exactly why she sounded so happy  about leaving for a week of hard training. Finally, five minutes later,  Nanoha opened the door and leaned against the frame. “Why are you still  in your pajamas?” The red head wondered. “And why do you look like you  just ran a ten mile marathon without a break?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“S-sorry...” She panted out, fanning herself. “I, um, got caught up in my... kick boxing exercises.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No wonder you're so fit, you really enjoy it don't you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh yeah. I <em>really</em> enjoy it.” Nanoha panted more, smiling dreamily and still fanning herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't push yourself so much. Your legs are shaking, you look like you're about to fall down.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She does that to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  does that to me,” She corrected herself. “Kick boxing. Hard on the  legs. Yeah. Wow.” She giggled happily. “Just a minute, I'll get  dressed.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate sighed  out after the monitor cut off and looked up when Yuuno knocked on her  office door. “Whoa,” He greeted her. “You look positively pissed,  should I come back”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, no, come in.” She ushered the male into her room. “Have a seat. That was Sora's garage.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Any news about your car?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  there's an insurance claim issue somewhere. Probably because after I  messed it up on that last mission I swapped to full coverage... A month  later my car blows up. Literally.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well you <em>are</em> known for  purposely hurting your car just for an excuse to upgrade it.” He got a  look, making him grin. “Not that it's insurance fraud or anything.” He  gave the girl a wink and received a laugh. “I have good news for you,”  Yuuno tossed a watch onto her desk. “Guess what that baby is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate picked it up and observed it. “Looks like a standard device used by civilians for their daily lives.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh how wrong you are.” He leaned forward. “That's an A.A.M.F.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“An Anti-Anti-Magic Field.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  looked at him a moment. “Wait a minute, you're telling me that in just  two days you already made something that will cancel out an AMF, when  our highest researchers and developers havn't even come close in?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More or less,” Yuuno nodded. “Yes. Yes, I did.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“By Elune, I love you!” Fate looked at it with more interest. “How does it work?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Its  a prototype,” He admitted. “Scaglietti's devices use a certain  frequency that interfere with the kinetic properties of the stem cells  when they reproduce to cause friction that amplifies the chi flow of  your body and-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno!” Fate snapped at him. “Lamen's terms, <em>please</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It simply stops the AMF frequency from doing what it's supposed to. Or at least that's what it <em>will</em> do. Right now it scrambles it. You'll still be powered down, but only  by ten to twenty percent. I need your help to test it if you would.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let's test it right now!” The girl stood up and closed her monitors.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But what about your work?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm not a desk junkie,” Fate grabbed him and hauled him out the door. “Kha-san, finish up for me please!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ehhh!?” The man known as Kha gasped out. “Again!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“New  assistant for me,” Fate informed Yuuno when he gave her a questioning  look. “He helps me do my paperwork when I'm too busy... also runs  errands for me, attends meetings so I won't have to, brings me what I  need, and even refills my coffee cup from my thermos.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno looked over his shoulder while Fate pulled him along. “Being your secretary has gotta <em>suck</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What was that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I said the guy sure has a lot of luck, getting to work with you and all.” He replied smoothly.</span></p>

Subaru  punched repeatedly on the shield in front of her before spinning around  and using Mach Caliber to kick the barrier and shatter through it.  Another appeared right behind it, a different color and spinning  quickly. Taking to the new target, she punched it as hard as she could  before pulling her hand back and shaking it. “Ow! Son of a!” Subaru  kicked the shield and slipped, falling on her butt. “Ow! Again!” The  barrier dissipated and Caro ran over to her, followed closely by  Freidliche.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm sorry, was it too much?” She offered her hand to help Subaru stand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  blue haired girl smiled to herself but took the offered hand anyway,  pretending that the short girl was helping her stand. “Thank you, Caro,  I'm just beat.” After getting her balance she dusted off her pants and  looked over at her other team mate “Tia, you about ready to call it a  day?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia turned around and pointed her guns at separate floating  spheres,pulling her triggers and making them glow. Once done the orbs  spun around to form a new pattern for her to shoot. When all of the  balls were glowing once again they flew around her again and lined up  in a row to show her accuracy rating. “Yes,” She finally answered,  panting. “I just finished up the afternoon's training.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Looks  like you're all having fun,” Yuuno greeted them as he stepped onto the  blank training field. The three turned to look at him and the device he  was holding. “Mind if we take over for a while?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You and Fate-san?” Caro pondered. “I didn't know you could go against Fate-san one on one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The male faltered lightly. “I'm useful on the battlefield in many ways besides fighting...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno is a support mage,” Fate told them. “Didn't he train you alongside Nanoha once or twice?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He acted like a ranged fighter at the time,” Tia mused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yuuno  helped Nanoha and me train for several years when we were on Earth. We  didn't have a training area so he would form the barriers for us and  also made up training exercises. Tia, your shooting orbs are actually  originally his design.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No way!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno sighed out. “I'm never taken seriously...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anyway, Yuuno, if you would?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,”  He placed the device on the ground and waved out his hand to form a  barrier. “You three, please leave the training area. This isn't going  to be normal training.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We're up to it!” Subaru clenched her  fist. “I feel ten times stronger than last time we were together,  Yuuno-san! I can handle it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate ignored them. “Lets do this, Yuuno.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.” With a quick flick of his wrist the group was encased in a barrier.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why aren't we using the training field's barrier?” Caro looked around.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Specifics?” Yuuno asked, eyes closed and concentrating.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Training level:SS. Restriction times three.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  male opened his eyes. “Fate, that's a little extreme don't you think?”  He looked over at her when she didn't answer. Fate's gaze was looking  at the ground, hand twitching lightly. “...Okay. I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you, Yuuno.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If I think you'll get hurt, I'm canceling the simulation.” He received a nod and once more he closed his eyes and concentrated.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru  looked over at Tia and was about to ask what was going on but a sudden  feeling made her stop. All at once she found herself flat on her face,  pinned to the ground. “Wha...what's going on!?” She looked at her  friend who was slowly falling to her knees. Tia tried to resist be also  fell down on her stomach, unable to move. “Tia!? Caro!?” The pink  haired girl looked like she was in pain from the sudden force.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  told you,” Yuuno knelt down and lifted Caro slowly, walking to the edge  of the barrier and sitting her outside of it. The girl gasped out,  looking instantly relieved. “This isn't your normal training.  Everything in this barrier has three times as much force than normal,  so basically the simply act of taking a step suddenly becomes a  complicated exercise.” With his help the other two girls escaped the  field. “Fate, I'm going to activate the AMF, are you ready?” After the  nod he knelt by the device he sat down earlier and pushed a button.  Fate staggered a moment but still managed to keep her jacket on and  Bardiche still flared into assault form. “Good... I'm reading you at  seventy five percent your normal power. Personal limiter removed, field  status: all green. Fate you are clear to begin your training.” A  keyboard came in front of him and after a few strokes, several of the  highest threat drones appeared. “I don't need to tell you but I will  anyway...If you mess up you could seriously get hurt or killed so I'm  going to stop this any second I see fit.” Fate nodded at him. With that  being said, he pressed the start button.</span></p>

Elio  looked at the door when a soft knock came on it. “Come in,” He replied  easily, keeping his eyes on the empty glass soda bottles he was  juggling. As expected Lutecia walked in and closed the door behind  herself before sitting on his bed and watching him. The red head didn't  talk for a moment, still concentrating on what he was doing. With a  flip, he grabbed one of the three bottles in one hand and acted like he  was pouring the contents out while keeping the other two in the air via  one handed juggling. After three second he re-added the bottle into the  mix, juggled once more, and caught them.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why do you do that?” The  girl finally spoke while he put them on his desk. “Juggle those  bottles? You are always doing it when I come see you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It calms  me down,” Elio sat next to her on the bed and allowed her to hold his  hand. “My escape from the world. Do you have one?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” She laid  back and looked at the ceiling. “Well... I guess the shower. When I'm  in the bath I don't think about anything but how nice it feels.” Her  eyes turned to look up into his. “...And you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lutecia...” He let the girl pull him down on top of her and looked into her eyes. “...What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I...” The girl blushed. “Want to kiss you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio sighed softly. “Lutecia...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know.” She closed her eyes and gripped the front of his shirt with both  her hands. “I'm sorry... But just for a moment... I want to feel  spoiled...Please?” Her eyes closed as she leaned up, pecking his cheek.  “It's too much to ask?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're mature for your age,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You are too.” She encouraged him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can't open myself to someone keeping me prisoner.” Elio sat up once again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm not keeping you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  want to be next to you!” She threw herself against his chest and held  onto his shirt. “While you're here I can touch you. If you leave me  I'll be sad...but...” She swallowed back her tears. “If I make you this  uncomfortable, you can go... I'll take you and let you leave...”  Lutecia gasped when she felt herself being embraced. “Elio...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  want you to come with me,” He whispered. “I told you, I won't abandon  you. You're not a bad girl, Lutecia. I'll make them understand that. I  promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...I trust you.” Slowly she pulled back from him enough to look up. “Elio...” Once again she closed her eyes and leaned up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro-hime will be glad to see you again as well, I'm sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia's breath caught in her throat and she slowly pulled back. “...Yeah...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What's wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She looked down and placed her palm on his chest. “Nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did I say something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You still don't understand.” She stood up. “But that's okay, I won't give up. Caro-chan isn't that far ahead of me yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you mean? Ahead of you at what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smiled. “I'll check to see if we have a new mission soon. Do you have everything you need?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“With  your help I've been able to store all the data I could into Strada. I  think I have a complete copy of most everything here.” He nodded. “I  know everything about my past now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Will you tell me?” Lutecia inspected the bottles he was juggling earlier.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You didn't read the files?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you wanted me to know, you would tell me.” She looked back over at him.  “I was really tempted, but I only read enough to get your interest when  we spoke on the street a while ago.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” Elio considered it  a moment. “Well, there isn't much to it like I thought...I was created  to be a weapon, code named Project F. I was experiment Eli, one that  was being tested using information from a scientist named Wily  Scaglietti. His files stated that if a human soul had no positive  emotions they would be able to be converted into a gem of power, a  Jewel Seed. His experiment recorded a girl named Aura undergoing the  process. Using that basic principle of the data, someone made me. When  I awoke I destroyed the lab and everything around it. I was stopped  after being hit in the head. When I awoke I was in a hospital with no  memories of what had happened. Two people found me in the fire and  assumed I lived in the apartment complex that also burned down since it  was on top of the laboratory. They adopted me, but died two years  later. Jail found me and wanted me to work for him. Fortunately for me,  Fate-san was on the scene and saw my Parents die. Their last words were  a request to take care of their son... Fate-san took me back to  Midchilda's capital city and I lived in the refugee homes but she still  took care of me whenever she could. Two years later, when I was almost  ten, she wanted to adopt me. I agreed but legally she was refused.  Despite her background and military status she was deemed to be an  unfit mother because of her age. Fate's mom, my mom now, adopted me  instead, making Fate my older sister and legal guardian. After we  realized I could use magic, I enlisted in the military. Boot camp was a  nightmare but I came out on top and was promoted Private second class.  That more or less brings me to now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I thought I had it rough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell me about yourself?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You want to know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wouldn't have asked unless I did.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia  smiled, a faint blush across her cheeks. “Well, I don't remember much  before I was in the laboratory. It was always really cold there, and we  were treated more or less like experiments. Not to the point of being  held in cages or anything, but the housing projects were severely  under-funded.” The girl walked over to the desk and sat down in the  chair so she could look at Elio while talking. “I remember they would  talk to us as if we were mindless people, always telling us what to do  and where to go. Although they weren't allowed to do anything inhumane  to us it still felt like they didn't really care. They made me summon  different things, sometimes even forcing me to by using some sort of  thing that went over my head. It was during those times I would black  out and when I awoke, several people were hurt and I was in bed,  restrained. The other people there would undo the straps and I would  cry in the corner. A month later Caro-chan came. She went through the  same things I did, but I wouldn't let her be strapped to a bed. I would  hold her while she cried in her sleep...” Lutecia looked down at her  hands. “She was so little, two years younger than myself. I couldn't  stand seeing her go through it. One time something went wrong and while  under a forced unconsciouses summon, she called forth a dragon. It  decimated the entire area before it was dispelled. After that both of  us were put in a room together. I remember playing with her, trying to  cheer her up, before Zest came to pick me up. I came here and Jail told  me that the reason Caro-chan and I destroyed things was because our  summons went out of control based on our emotions. He gave me these  gloves to make sure I didn't accidentally hurt anything else. After a  while he promised to help me live a normal life if I would work for  him... After that, Zest and I were sent out to recover relics for him.  The more I collected, the better gloves he would give me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That's where we split off. Caro-hime was given gloves to boost her power, not limit it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Boost? But that would go against everything I was told...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lutecia, Do you still believe Scaglietti's lies?” Elio face-palmed. “After all we've done the past...week?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl looked down and rubbed her hands together. “I'm... more scared than anything...What if...What if it's true?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can I see your gloves a moment?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia looked at him. “What, why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  just do, please?” He held out his hand. “Just for a bit?” The girl  looked at him for a few moments while debating with herself. After a  while she finally nodded and called forth her gloves only and allowed  Elio to take them. “Thanks,” With Lutecia's age gap he found them to be  a pretty good fit, despite his hands being larger. “I'm not giving them  back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio!” Lutecia reached out her hand but the boy crossed  his arms. “This isn't funny, I need those!” She tried to grab his hand  and gasped when he turned so she couldn't. “Elio, I'm serious, give  them!” She tried again and again, finally pushing him onto the bed and  wrestling with him to try and remove the gloves. “Elio please I'm  begging you!” The two scrapped a little longer, rolling over each other  and getting tangled in the covers. “I'm going to hurt everyone! I can't  stop it! Please!” Again she tried but only managed to find herself  laying on her chest with his arms wrapped around her, holding the girl  so she couldn't move. “Eliooo!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When you're stressed emotionally  you summon, huh?” He countered her, struggling to keep the spazing girl  under his control. “Where are they then!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia went still in  his arms. She stayed silent a moment before moving her hands up to look  at them behind his head. “They're... they're not even glowing...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I <em>told</em> you,” He whispered. “He was lying to you all along.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  purple haired girl pulled back from him and placed both her arms by his  shoulders, panting while looking down at him. “All this time...All the  people I hurt...was for... nothing?” She blinked a few times, feeling  her eyes water. “All the tears I refused to shed... all the pain I held  inside... The times I wanted to scream but stayed an emotional less  doll...For... For nothing...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...I'm sorry.” He didn't know  what else to say right then. Lutecia finally broke, falling against him  and letting out all the pain and stress that had built up inside her  over the months. Elio slowly wrapped his arms around her and held the  girl, looking up at the ceiling and wondering exactly what he was going  to do once he got back to the Sixth Division if Lutecia was with him.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Fate...I  think this is enough.” Yuuno looked over the panting, sweating girl on  the ground. “You've been doing this every moment for the past three  days.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha...” She panted out, trying to pull herself up. “Is  getting stronger...I have to too...” With a loud groan she forced  herself up into a sitting position and used Bardiche as a prop so she  could stand. “I can...go on...Set specifics:”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” Yuuno waved out his hands, canceling his barrier and then the training simulation. “You're going to bed. Right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I want to train! I have to be stronger! So nothing can stop me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  is why you have that nickname, Fate!” Yuuno yelled at her, making the  girl freeze in her tracks. “Don't do stupid things. We're going back,  we'll continue tomorrow afternoon, after you rest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Okay,”  Fate began to walk to the bridge that connected the training field to  the land, limping slightly as she did so. “How long until Nanoha comes  back?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She still has two days minimal. If she masters the spells  given to her then she'll come back then, if her or Vita havn't  perfected them, it'll be longer. You know how they are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,”  Fate smiled fondly to herself. “That's my Nanoha. Always pushes herself  to the limit to make sure she can take care of everyone.. I can't wait  till she gets back, I'm going to cook her a huge dinner, cuddle while  watching a movie, and then have hot and wild sex for five hours  straight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ugh, spare me.” Yuuno rubbed his nose. “I don't want to know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm teasing,” Fate smiled at him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha rubs off on you too much...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”  Fate stood by him while he closed the training ground officially for  the night via the console. “She tell you about our love life?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Too much,” He shook his head. “More than I ever need to know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anything interesting?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She wanted a three way when we were seventeen.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate blushed darkly. “You're <em>kidding</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I am,” He winked at her. “Now we're even.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou, you!” Fate smiled at him. “I'm going to get in bed if you won't let me train.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Go  ahead, I have a few stops to make along the way.” He waved to the blond  and watched her walk away while he finished recording the data and  other miscellaneous details. Once done he yawned to himself and made  his way over to the residential area while looking at the stars. The  back of his mind instantly started breaking apart the constellations  absently, comparing them to how they looked on other planets. '<em>For thinking so much,</em>' His mind wandered as he walked. '<em>I sure can't see such a simple thing as Scaglietti attacking personally. It almost cost them their lives...</em>' Yuuno shook his head quickly, trying to rid himself of those thoughts. '<em>It  doesn't matter, Hayate didn't see it either. It was too random. What  the hell is he doing? Making an appearance and simply leaving when he  could have killed them both? He's sick; toying with people like this.  No wonder the girls act so rash around him, they're so angry they can't  think straight...</em>' Upon entering the mess hall he looked around at  the late night people and the random civilians visiting their friends.  To his surprise he saw the forwards at a table together, watching a  monitor. Walking over to them he noticed that they were reviewing the  training Fate had just gone under and were discussing it piece by  piece. By the time he reached them it was ending with him shouting at  her to call it a night. “Are you that interested?” He pondered, making  all three of them jump in their seats and turn around before saluting.  “If you wanted to watch you could have used the training field's  monitors instead of just the remote one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, well, we didn't  want to be a bother...” Subaru laughed nervously. “We couldn't even  move in that field and she was under the influence of the AMF...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia nodded. “And you were constantly tweaking her watch so we didn't want to bother you either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno  grinned to himself. “My apologies, we get lost in thought when we  train. I'm sure you've seen Nanoha space out when she has something on  her mind?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lots of times,” Tia confirmed, making Caro cover a  smile. “But one thing caught my attention?” She trailed off as if to  ask permission to vocalize her question. She received a nod so she went  on. “What was that nickname you mentioned? Was it “The Terror of  Death”?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How did you know that name?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia looked a little  nervous, as Yuuno's voice didn't seem thrilled she knew it. “Well... A  few months ago I was getting scolded and she mentioned it...And also  'White Devil' as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's not something many new people  know,” The male sat down at the table and propped his chin up on the  back of his hands. “I guess it would be better coming from me instead  of someone else.” After letting out a sigh he went about answering her.  “ I'm sure you've been told about 'the switch' that military have,  right?” They all nodded at him. “I don't know if you've been able to do  it yet but you already know the basics of it anyway: being able to turn  on and off your battle mode without letting personal feelings effect  your war and not letting the war effect your personal feelings. Well,  some of the veterans have another switch, a 'Devil Trigger' as Nanoha  calls it. Its a trigger that happens when you see or experience  something so intense that you can't control yourself anymore...” The  male looked down. “Fate... was the top of her squad at everything they  did. You name it, she was always number one: Private first class,  Corporal first class, Sergeant first class, Warrant officer first  class, Lieutenant first class, you get the picture. Right after she  became an enforcer, her leader was called to an emergency and left her  in charge of the rest of the squad, unit seven. She was in command of  five people that she had gone through most of the ranks with, although  they were lower of course, being normal mages. At that time...” Yuuno  trailed off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If we don't need to know, then-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno cut  Subaru off. “No, it's okay. If I stop here you'll just look it up when  I'm gone anyway, won't you?” The group didn't say anything so he  continued. “Fate lead them on a mission, and split up with them. Her  team went to explore a mine shaft where some galacticly wanted criminal  was supposed to be hiding. It was a trap meant for her...” He closed  his eyes. “They all died in seconds.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How awful...” Caro whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Twenty  people were waiting for them, it was a massacre. Fate was sent a  monitor by the person she was after and saw it all happen live. It was  then that Fate snapped her Devil Trigger for the second time, the first  being when she thought Nanoha had died. Fate went to the mine and...”  Yuuno took a breath. “The news the next day,” He skipped. “Showed the  scene recorded by a field reporter. Fate was recorded and it was shown,  more of a boost to credit the TSAB's force. They used Fate's pain to  send a warning to anyone who opposes us. She was dubbed “The Terror of  Death” then and it stuck instantly. Everyone around the base called her  that for over a year. Finally it died down when Nanoha graduated from  the battle instructor school, also top of her class.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is Nanoha,” Subaru interrupted . “Oh, sorry...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's  okay. Yes, Nanoha is 'The White Devil” but it's not as bad as Fate.  Nanoha has always had an amazing source of magic, so much so that  scientist are still amazed when they see it. The reason she's still  classified as an S+ mage is because she only takes the exam to rank up  when she's sure she'll ace it perfectly, and also only does them when  Fate does as well. She doesn't care about anything other than being as  equal to Fate as she can, so there's a higher chance they'll be  stationed together. Well, that's not important anymore, but at the time  it was. Anyway, Nanoha's sweet personality changes when she's on the  battlefield. She fights with mercy but when push comes to shove, she  more or less shoves the hardest. Her destructive power mixed with her  merciful tactics gave her “White Devil” as a name. Someone who  possesses enough demonic energy to destroy anything in her path, but  also caring enough not to use it wrongly. Of course people who don't  know the full story think it's because she wears white while battling.  I don't want any of you to misunderstand them, that's why I'm telling  you this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see...” Tia nodded at him lightly. “Thank you. I almost had doubts about them...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  remember, both of them are caring girls, don't let anything people say  make you think otherwise.” He stood up and pushed his glasses up on his  nose. “On that note, don't let anything people say about you get to you  either. You're Riot Force Six's top forwards, but most importantly,  you're all girls with kind hearts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sir!” All three of them saluted and got one back.</span></p>

Elio  sat up instantly when the door to his room opened. Out of instinct he  tried to call Strada to his hands but nothing came to his call. Jail  looked at him with an amused smirk and got a glare in return. “What do <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">you</span></em> want?” He spat at him angrily. “If it's another mission you can take it and shove it.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My,  what a filthy mouth you have.” The man crossed his arms with an amused  look. “You are not what I need right now, Elio. I need my Lutecia's  assistance with something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why did you come here then?” Elio  countered him. He kept his eyes locked on Jail as he approached him and  grabbed the covers of the bed, flinging them back to reveal Lutecia who  was just waking up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lutecia, I need you to come to my office when you're done with your little fling, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,”  She replied easily. “I'll be there shortly.” With those words Jail left  the room. The two stayed silent a moment longer before Lutecia sat up  to swing her legs off the bed and smooth out the wrinkles in her  pajamas. “He probably wants me to retrieve something for him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you going to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm  going to get the information for the mission and come pick you up.” She  walked over to him and touched his cheek with a finger before giving  him an honest smile. “And then...I'm going to put myself in your hands.  Please take care of me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” Elio reached up and took her hand, giving it a small squeeze. “I'll take care of you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” She gave him another look and blush before calling her barrier jacket and leaving the room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">'<em>Lutecia's... Showing emotions again.</em>' He grinned. '<em>Time to get ready to go home!</em>'</span></p>

Fate  groaned, opening her eyes and sitting up in bed. “Ugh, I had a horrible  nightmare, Nanoha.” Nothing came to sooth her, reminding the blond that  she was alone. After rubbing her eyes she realized that she was in the  middle of the bed. “No wonder...” Deciding to put the dream behind her,  she crawled out of bed and almost fell onto the floor. “Ughhh... I'm  too tired to be moving...” She looked at her clock lazily and gasped  out when she realized it was already seven in the morning. “Oh my god,  I over slept!” The closet door opened quickly and her uniform was  hastily put on. “Oh man, I bet they're wondering where I am at the  office!” She double checked her pantyhose to make sure she didn't have  any runs in them and pulled down on her mini skirt to straighten it.  Once prepared she grabbed a brush and quickly started combing her hair,  once again amazed at how much easier it was when she didn't have it so  long. Finally after she declared herself presentable she grabbed her  lipstick and gave herself a barely noticeable haze over her lips and  smiled at the result. She didn't look half bad, in her own opinion. The  blond leapt over the railing of her bedroom and floated down to the  floor, putting on her heels and reaching for the door.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Several  monitors appeared around her, flashing red. “Fate-chan!” Hayate's voice  suddenly came up, paired with a video image. “We have a lock on Elio,  report immediately!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma'am!” Fate saluted her and called her  barrier jacket. “So much for looking pretty today...” She changed her  direction and ran to the windows, inputting the command to make them  open and leaping through them almost before they allowed her to. With a  twist in the air, she scanned the area and saw the forwards running  along the ground towards the building as well from different  directions. Upon landing in the room she gave Hayate and Yuuno a nod  and moved to stand next to them and look at the monitor. “So you found  him?” The screen flashed to Elio and Lutecia walking though a forest.  “He has his weapon back?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And the AMF as well as the jamming field around him has been removed.” Hayate bit her lip. “Yuuno?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Either  they're about to enter dangerous territory and need to be in top form,  or Elio somehow managed to talk his way into getting his powers back.”  Leaning forward, he pushed up his glasses. “They're holding hands.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ponderous,” Hayate mused. “Let's hope for the best and prepare for the worst. They're about three hours away by flight...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Three <em>hours</em>!?” Fate gasped. “There's no way we'll get there in time!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate  bit her lip. “Use a jet instead of the helicopter. It'll be crowded but  it will cut the time in half easily. Fate you will have to fly back  since there won't be any room with Elio and Lutecia as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Our goal is to capture her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, please. Primary, Elio. Secondary, Lutecia. I want her under arrest and magic neutralized.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma'am!”  Fate saluted and nodded over at Vice before two ran out of the room.  “Turn around!” She told the forwards, who were running to her in the  hallway. “We're going to the air strip!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Elio  looked around the thick jungle and growled to himself while pushing  giant leaf out of his way with Strada. “What is a relic doing around <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">here</span></em> of all places?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't know,” Lutecia yelped lightly after almost tripping over a root. “It's hot and sticky out here, I don't like it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't  like being hot do you?” Elio looked around himself and licked his lips.  “For some reason...I have a really bad feeling. Scan the area?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,”  Lutecia closed her eyes and called forth a circle beneath her feet.  “What I desire... Small things to be my eyes, to search the area and  tell me where what I seek is.” Several small objects appeared around  them, forming into something that resembled mosquitoes. “Be off, take  care okay?” she waved at her pets. “They should find something soon.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Great.” Elio wiped the sweat from his eyes. “The sooner we can find that relic and get to section six the better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia followed him, once again taking his hand in hers. “Why don't we go there directly?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  would look a lot better for you if you offer a relic as a peace gift.”  A quick look at his watch made a compass appear on top of it. “We were  told to head north from the drop off point but we've been walking for  an hour and nothing!” He slashed his spear and cut through a bunch of  vines. “What's going on?” A few more steps and he was suddenly in a  sort of clearing. “What the...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why is there a clearing in the  middle of the jungle?” Lutecia let go of his hand and walked forward.  “Look!” She pointed to the center of the circlish area. “Somethings  there!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No wait, don't touch it!” Elio yelled, running after  her. Lutecia looked over at him with a confused look just as her hand  touched the metallic object embedded into the ground. A spark flashed  around her but the girl didn't seem otherwise hurt. “Lutecia...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.” The girl stood up straight.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You okay?” Elio started walking closer to her. “Did you hurt your hand?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lutecia?” Elio stopped moving. “You sound kind of odd.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come closer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio  licked his lips but still did as he was asked, stopping right behind  her. “Hey...?” The girl in front of him turned around quickly and he  felt a searing pain in his stomach. “Lu...te...cia...” Elio's breath  caught in his throat, slowly looking down. The girl pulled back,  ripping a short dagger from his stomach that immediately started to  bleed drastically. “...Why...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because I was ordered.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With both hands covering the wound he looked up again and into Lutecia's lifeless eyes. “You're being... controlled!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”  Lutecia suddenly shook her head and stepped back. “Ahn... My  head...Don't touch it, Elio, it made me blank out a moment.” She paused  her rant, looking down at the bloody dagger in her hand and then over  at Elio when he fell to his knees. “What...No... I...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio offered her a small smile. “I'm okay...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio!”  Dropping the weapon she ran to him, catching him as he fell. “Oh no...  no! I ... I'm sorry! I don't... I didn't mean to...What..!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  were set up,” He felt himself be laid down onto his back. “Your gloves,  take'm off...” He watched hazily as she quickly did so. “That's  probably how... he did it. He knew... The bastard knew!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't  get upset! Don't move!” She removed her barrier jacket and grabbed her  dress, ripping it and placing the cloth over the wound and pressed down  to try and make his blood clot. “You'll be okay!” Her eyes watered.  “Elio...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't cry...” Elio's voice trailed off as the shock wore off and the real pain began to set in on him. “Lutecia...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio!” Her eyes scanned the area frantically. '<em>What do I do!?What do I DO!?</em>' Swallowing she looked back down at her blood covered hands. '<em>I can't go back to the base...I don't know how to get to his from here, and even if I did I couldn't carry him!</em>'</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Subaru  nodded over at Vice and gave Tia a nervous glance. The girls watched  the hatch open on the cramped jet and released their seat belts  crossing their chest one at a time. “On three!” She heard Fate command  them. The second ticked off and on the third one she jumped to the  hatch, being sucked out instantly and slide down her wing road towards  the ground. Tia followed her instantly and after a screaming fit of  fear, they both shot through the treetops and landed in the jungle.  Fate turned to Caro and nodded at her before leaping out as well. Fate  turned and looked up at the jet as she fell. Caro appeared a moment  later and after a bright blue flash, her ice dragon appeared.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shiva!” Caro gripped the dragon's neck to stabilize herself. “No wait, we need to go the other way!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Our mission is this way</em>,” It told her mentally as she flew away from the rest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you mean!?” Caro looked around a moment before Fate contacted her. “<em>I'm sorry, Shiva is taking me somewhere,</em>” She sent to Fate. “<em>Keep going, I'll see what she wants and meet up with you.</em>” After she was reluctantly granted permission Caro looked back over where her dragon was taking her. “What is is, Shiva?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Your goal is this way,</em>” Shiva circled a clearing in the forest. “<em>I can smell them.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro  blinked when they landed and hopped off her back. Turning around, she  saw Lutecia hunched over across from her. “Lutecia-chan!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro-chan!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  pink haired girl ran forward a few steps. “Elio-kun!” She picked up her  pace but stopped all at once she saw the blood on her hands. “What  the!?” She saw Lutecia look to the ground and followed her gaze and  seeing the dagger next to them. “You... you...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The purple haired girl looked at her with a scared expression. “I... I didn't meant to...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You...stabbed him...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro-chan, listen, I-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did you stab him!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn't meant to!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro's vision blurred. “You stabbed my knight!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shiva stood behind her and glared. “<em>Take your revenge, Princess.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro's scream echoed around them as she ran forward. “What I ask for-!!!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Did you hear that?” Tia asked, looking behind herself. “An explosion?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-san!” Subaru looked up as the girl landed. “Where's Caro?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Requested  permission to investigate something.” Fate looked around the jungle.  “I'm hoping she'll be able to find Elio with the help of her dragon. We  are to continue as planned.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I hear something...” Tia drew both her pistols. “...My neck is itching...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  looked around as her squad went back to back. Slowly she circled  around, eyes darting in different directions. “We're surrounded.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“ But <em>how</em>?” Subaru asked as she swallowed thickly. “We just landed, there's no way...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's  a set up!” Fate looked up as a single metallic sphere fell beside them.  “Get down!” Thrusting out her hand, she formed a shield in front of  them as the device opened up. Instead of a blast of energy a white-ish  haze flew over them. “AMF!” The blond turned to check on her teammates.  Both of them still had their barrier jackets but they were fading in  and out. “Hang on!” She gripped Bardiche tightly. '<em>Yuuno's device isn't perfect yet, they don't have enough magic energy to stand up to it like I do...</em>'</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They're  coming!” Subaru forced herself up and loaded a cartridge into her  glove, firing out the rifle shell and solidifying her jacket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How  many!?” Tia began shooting at the people running at them, loading two  cartridges of her own to stabilize herself. “Fate-san!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  won't touch my team!” Fate flared out her scythe and flew at the  device. Amazingly her attack missed, cutting into the ground as the  sphere flew into the air and scattered around between the trees. “Che,  Upgrades...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru blocked a glowing sword with her glove and  flicked it away from her, punching the man in the gut and sending him  to the floor. “What is this!? Why aren't they effected!?” A spin kick  made another man back off of her before blasting him in the chest with  a charged magic attack. The spell fizzled out half way and only sent  the man stumbling back onto the ground instead of slinging him through  the air.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's not magic!” Fate flipped the end of her staff up  under a man's chin and quickly spun her scythe around and sliced his  chest, drawing blood from the gash. “Scaglietti's behind this!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia  loaded another two cartridges and reloaded her gun, shooting as quickly  as she could. “There's too many!” Five shots were wasted on trying to  sink the AMF drone that was still flying above them out of their reach  and hiding in leaves whenever it could. “Fate-san!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate growled,  eyes scanning the area. “It's come down to it... Either we die... or  they do.” Fate narrowed her eyes and took a serious stance, holding her  scythe above her head. “Bardiche! Load cartridge!” Three shells shot  out of her device. “Plasma Smasher!” The attack ripped through the  ground, blowing up the earth and shattering the trees. Several people  fell fell to the ground but more just seemed to come. “Tia, Subaru!  Don't hold back!” Fate flew to the side and held out her hand, sending  several blade like projectiles into her opponents. “This is war, take  them down or we'll all die!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru nodded and tried to steady herself. '<em>It's like a switch,</em>' she thought nervously. 'T<em>his is what I trained for... I can't let them hurt Tia or Fate! If I have to dirty my hands...</em>' Subaru screamed, charging her glove and skating forward on her wing road. '<em>Then so be it!</em>' The girl punched out. “Divine Buster, Shoot!” Two shells flew out and landed on the forest floor.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Lutecia flipped her body around, landing in the dirt and sliding along it. “Caro-chan listen to me!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!”  Caro threw her hands out, once again forming her circle. “What I ask  for, spears of the earth!” She raised her right hand. “Stone Spiker!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  purple haired girl leapt into the air as the ground under her shifted  and thrust upwards in spikes. “What I desire,” she started while  floating in the air. “A means to subdue my opponent, bind her to the  ground, vine lash!” She pointed at Caro.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With a roll, Caro  avoided the several vines snapping around her and trying to ensnare the  girl. “I'm going to take my revenge!” She screamed loudly. “What I ask  for!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What I desire,” Lutecia countered instantly, forming several wasp around her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Flames  to consume!” The dragon summoner finished, moving her hands out and  incinerating the insects that flew towards her. “I ask for-!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My  desire!” Once again their attacks canceled each other out, sparks  flying around as the flames died out and her summoned insects  dissipated. Lutecia flew towards her friend and tackled her hard. They  hit the ground and slid together before struggling to get a hold onto  each other. “Caro-chan! Stop this!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You hurt him! He's dieing!”  Caro screamed at Lutecia's face, flipping her over and rolling a few  more times. For a moment they simply wrestled on the ground, pulling  hair and biting each other. After what seemed like ages, Caro managed  to get her in a headlock. “What I... ask for...” She panted out,  forming her circle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I...desire...” Lutecia countered her, gasping for air while Caro gripped her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Earth to rise...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Water to soften...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stone Spike!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mud  blast!” A column of mud erupted under them, covering both and  separating them. “You're making a mistake!” Lutecia steadied herself  and moved her hands. “Listen to me! What I desire...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What I ask  for-!” Caro glared at her, panting hard and holding her right side  where Lutecia had landed a solid hit on her. The two girls kept their  eye contact for a long time, waiting for one to make a move so the  other could cancel it with her own. After what seemed like ages, she  started. “A wave of water!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A wall of stone!” Lutecia clapped  her hands together and touched the ground, summoning forth the earth  and covering her body in a small dome as Caro's tidal wave splashed all  around it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What I <em>need</em>,” Caro panted out as the earth shield vanished to reveal her opponent.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What I <em>require</em>,”  Lutecia spoke softly, wavering as the chain casting took its toll on  her. “A swarm of insects, to head my demands!” She thrust out her hand.  “Wasp army!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A fall of earth and water!” Caro concluded her  spell, breaking the ground under them and making it soar at the other  girl along with the pressure of a geyser freshly summoned. The bugs  assaulting her had their wings covered in mud and forcing them to fall  to the ground. Lutecia screamed out as the attack landed, washing over  her and finally leaving the soaking wet and mud caked girl on the  ground, panting weakly for air. “What I ask for,” She whispered as she  slowly walked forward to end it. “Ice from my heart...” She felt Shiva  smile behind her as she weakly froze the ground along with the water  and mud on her enemy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Good job, Princess.</em>” Shiva invaded her mind. “<em>Now you can have your revenge. You can take the life of the one who stole what belongs to you.</em>”  Caro held out her hand and called forth water and cold, freezing it  into the shape of a dagger. Her small puffs of air came out in burst of  fog, breath being so cold it was visible in the heat around them.  Slowly she sank to her knees and gripped the weapon with both hands,  looking into Lutecia's scared and trembling eyes as she raised it above  her head. “<em>With this attack, you will be satisfied,</em>” Shiva coached her along. “<em>Bring it down, and settle this!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">'<em>Jealousy makes you do things you normally wouldn't. We don't want Caro-chan to be a bad person do we?</em>'</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">'<em> You're not alone, we're all here with you. We'll get Elio back.</em>'</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">'<em> You have gentle power, so I'm not worried about my team while you are with them</em>.'</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">'<em>Caro is a kind, loving girl.</em>'</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">'<em> Power to protect everyone!'</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro felt the world come back into focus and dropped the dagger behind herself. “What... am I doing...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Do not hesitate!</em>” Shiva screamed into her head. “<em>Take your revenge!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  isn't... This isn't what I want to be!” Caro shook her head and looked  back over at her dragon. “This isn't who I am! I don't like this!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>We made a deal! Now kill her!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro shook her head. “No! I'm not going to hurt anymore! I want to help, to protect!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>She stole your knight!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio isn't some <em>thing</em> that I own!” Caro stood up and stood her ground. “ He can choose  whatever he wants! I want him to be with me for me, not because I own  him! He's my precious knight that I will always protect! I belong to <em>him!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Then I will do it for you!</em>” Shiva took a huge intake of air “<em>Ice breaker!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro  threw herself on top of Lutecia to shield her from the attack. Cold  wind ripped all around her, freezing her hands and chilling her bones.  Moments passed before she realized that she wasn't being turned to ice  and she slowly raised her head and gasped out. “Freidliche!” The full  sized dragon shook it's body to rid itself of the frost. “...Thank you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Princess,</em>” The new one spoke to her. “<em>As I promised, I will help you protect whatever you desire.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro  stood up and nodded firmly, walking over to him. “I'm sorry, Shiva...”  She shook her head sadly. “But I'm not the way you are... I wasn't  thinking right at the time...Thank you for watching over me, but I  don't want to use you for selfish reasons...I release you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shiva glared at the girl as her body started to fade away as the summon spell was canceled. “<em>There will be a time in the future,</em>” She spoke as blue mist started to settle around them “<em>That you will need my power again. When you seek it to hurt, I will come back when you call my name.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you.” Caro watched the last of her summon fade and looked up at Freidliche. “And I'm sorry. I was lost in myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The dragon roared out loudly, spreading it's wings and fully removing the rest of the ice on him. “<em>Your friends are hurt; I can heal them.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please.  Lutecia too.” She turned to look at the girl as she slowly broke free  of the frozen mud and shivered. “I'll listen to her now. But please,  save my Knight!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It shall be done.</span></em>”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia  collapsed to her knees, panting hard struggling to even just lift her  guns anymore. “That's it...I'm out...” A soft glowing came over her as  her barrier Jacket vanished, leaving her in only her standard training  outfit. “I don't have anymore magic...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tia!” Subaru loaded her  last shell and skated over to her, fighting the people who ran in for  the kill. “I won't let you die; stand up!” Two people slashed their  glowing weapons at her, getting blocked by Subaru's glove. “Go AWAY!”  Her glove tried to load another round but came up empty. Her shaking  hand started being pushed back, forcing her to her knees. “I won't...  Give up...” She glared at them, trying to force her way back up. The  next moment the two yelled out and Subaru's face was splashed with  blood. Fate stood in front of her, Bardiche starting to flicker.  “Fate-san!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate panted heavily, loading a shell just to keep her  device active. “Tia...” She took a breath. “Could you not shoot down  the AMF device?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I swear, I shot it five time!” She told her leader. “There has to be several of them, I saw it explode!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I believe you,” Fate steadied herself, eyes narrowing as the remaining force started approaching.'<em>there's no way I can take the rest out by myself... Even if they're not magical, they have weapons that rival A class mages...</em>' She closed her eyes and prepared herself. '<em>Nanoha...</em>'  A loud explosion caught her attention and turned her eyes to it. Smoke  rose up from the area and a body was slung out from it, hitting a tree  and revealing a long slash mark on his chest. The next moment a blur  shot from the dust and over against two people, clashing it's sword  with theirs. “Signum!” Fate gripped her weapon harder, encouraged at  the appearance of her rival. “No...wait... <em>Nanoha!?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  slashed twice, flooring the two people and flying into a group of  three. A bright flash of light blinded everyone a brief moment. When  they could see again a blue cape twirled around the girl as she spun  around, slinging her scythe around in a circle and gouging their  stomachs. Looking up, she saw two people leap from the trees at her.  The girl spun her scythe around and changed it back into a pendant  before flashing another light around herself and jumping into the air,  holding the red copy of Signum's sword and graced with the barrier  jacket as well, color coded to match her blue and white. The three  people landed, but only the female got on her feet again, once again  flaring forward and changing into her standard jacket and shooting  several bullets. The clip was emptied and she shoved another into it  quickly, loading three shells before her armor faded away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">'<em>The White Devil...</em>' Tia thought as Subaru hugged her and looked around in case anything attacked them. '<em>And...</em>'  She looked over at Fate, who just caught a complete magnum reload  tossed to her by her partner. Bardiche flared to life fully again and  she quickly engaged, bringing several to their knees. '<em>The Terror of Death.</em>' She swallowed when blood stained Nanoha's outfit, staying even as she shifted forms again. '<em>Able to kill... to keep fighting even when they're exhausted... To protect their team...</em>' Her guns shook in her hands. '<em>And  I'm here again... Letting Subaru protect me...I can't keep doing this!  I'm the leader when Fate and Nanoha aren't here! I have to be strong  too!</em>' A scream escaped her mouth as she stood up, bringing her guns  up again and shooting, calling upon her own reserves to form the  bullets. '<em>I don't care what they call me!</em>' Her mind flashed to Nanoha and Fate's kind smiles. '<em> I'll become a devil as well, as long as my precious partners are safe!</em>'</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  last man fell by Tia's bullet, leaving them in silence. A few groans  rang around them from the people they avoided killing but the battle  was over. “Nanoha!” Fate called her over and hugged the girl tightly.  “You're not supposed to be back for another day!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I finished  early,” She replied, hugging her back just as hard. “I called Yuuno-kun  to come pick me up and he told me about the mission. I flew over as  fast as I could.” A small explosion came and Tia finally collapsed,  having destroyed another AMF drone. “Good work, Tia,” She congratulated  her. “Good thing, I had to load three entire clips just to keep my  jacket around me...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tha...thank you...” She fell onto her hands  and knees. “I'm... gonna throw up...” Nanoha looked at Fate a moment  longer before running over to Tia and rubbing her back and speaking  softly to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru,” Fate called to her. “You okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” She looked half dead though. “I wouldn't mind visiting Shamal once we're back, though. Preferably quickly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right,”  She nodded at her and summoned up a monitor with the help of Bardiche.  “Lightning one to HQ.” Hayate appeared in front of her. “We were  ambushed, enemies defeated and we're okay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mission has been  completed,” She replied. “Caro found Elio and Lutecia and all three are  on their way back. Get out of there as soon as possible, there is no  relic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma'am.” She saluted and looked into the sky, seeing  Vice's jet above them. “Come on, let's load in. Without Caro and her  dragon we'll all fit.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“So  that's what happened...” Caro looked at Lutecia sadly. “I'm sorry, I  was so rash.” Her gaze faltered, choosing rather to look at the land  below them pass by as they rode her dragon.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I understand, it was a  bad circumstance...” The purple haired girl shifted uneasily. “So much  for making a good impression on your unit...I'll be thrown in jail for  sure...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No one has to know.” Caro shook her head. “Elio-kun is  fine, just drained. I'm sure they will listen to your story,  Lutecia-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You will still call me that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The dragon  summoner smiled to herself. “Yes. After all, how can I expect you to  forgive me, when I can't forgive what you've done?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Thank you... Caro-chan.” She reached out slowly to embrace the girl. “Thank you so much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You've had a hard time... This time, I will hold you if you want to cry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you...thank you...” her words broke, pulling her tighter. “Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Oh  wow, it feels great to be home again!” Nanoha stretched and took a long  intake of air when she entered her loft apartment suit. “I never  thought that debriefing would be over! Five <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">hours</span></em>! Oh man!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  had a lot to deal with,” Fate closed the door behind herself and kicked  off her heels, lining them up by the door and straightening Nanoha's  carelessly disregarded boots. “I can't believe Elio managed to gain all  that data!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lutecia-san hacked it all for him didn't she? I got  to say I never saw that one coming. Thanks to her defecting, we have  all the information we could ever want, and then some. Do you think the  armed forces sent to where his laboratory is right now will be able to  do anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It will be the same as the past. All the data will  be scrambled and useless and he will be long gone, taken all of the  experiments that looks promising. If there is anything in what Elio and  Lutecia gave us then we'll be able to bring the fight to him.” The  blond walked up to their bedroom and sat on the bed. “Too bad those two  are still in debriefing, I wanted to talk to him so much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't  mind,” Nanoha sat behind her and started rubbing her back. “I want to  as well, but it will be tomorrow before we can and we both know it.  Just as well, Vita-chan won't be back until then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think you missed this,” She giggled, applying gentle pressure to her  points. She took the time to inspect her lover's haircut more as well  since she was gone before being able to really look.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate moaned out contently. “I missed all of you, not just your back rubs.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?”  Nanoha giggled. “I missed you too.” Reaching around she started undoing  Fate's buttons on her shirt. “Let me rub you, it'll ease you up after  that battle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Gladly,” Fate shrugged off her shirt and fell face  first onto the bed, purring when the hands went to work on her sore  muscles. “ Man, I love you.” She got a happy laugh.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate  sighed out, wondering just why Hayate, her knights, and the forwards  were following her. “What's going on?” She finally asked, turning to  look at the mob of people walking behind her. “Nanoha asked me to come  meet her at Fuji's, why did this turn into a field trip?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because,” Hayate replied easily and left it at that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  blond rolled her eyes and turned back around in time to see a jet black  and yellow car skid to a stop in front of the bar. The front was pitch  black and slowly faded to yellow as it went along the car, leaving the  back of it the same golden color as her hair. “Oh <em>wow</em>!” Fate  instantly went into her 'car mode' as they called it and ran over to  the vehicle. “This paint job is amazing!” She looked at the dark tinted  windows and shaved off door handles. Continuing along she resisted the  urge to touch the spoiler and continued to circle the car around the  back, even looking at the bright yellow hubcaps. “I can smell the  nitros in it! I bet it could smoke my old car!” She looked at the  driver's side door. “Who's is it? The entrance to the vehicle hissed  slightly as it moved outward and flipped up instead of opening  outwards. “Wow!” Her mouth went dry when Nanoha stepped out of it.  “What!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,” She greeted casually, tossing her the key. “Happy early birthday.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  caught the key and stared at her a moment before turning back and  looking at her friends grinning at her. “What's going on...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate  giggled. “Nanoha took care of the paperwork and insurance claims and  used it to buy you a car. She took it to Sora's place and used all her  benefit back pay to customize it for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't know anything  about cars,” Nanoha admitted,scratching the back of her neck. “So I  just told Sora to do whatever it was you used to have and upgrade it if  possible. He said something about a new twin exhaust nitros boost with  personal H.U.D display on the dash but I have <em>no</em> clue what that means.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you <em>serious</em>!?”  Fate ran over to the car and stuck her head in. “Oh my god! It has  everything!” Testingly she reached out and touched a button, making the  clear wind breaker windows disappear and the top shatter into pieces to  fold back. “Its a convertible too!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yup yup!” Nanoha smiled at  her. “I havn't used any of my benefit car pay since I started working  for the military so I had enough to afford it all. Along with your  insurance and Hayate pulling some strings, I was able to move it all  you to your car and fix it up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A new voice got her attention.  “Oh she saw it already? Aw... I wanted to get the picture!” Sora waved  at them as he walked out of the bar with a camera.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You... You  did all this?” Fate looked at Nanoha, who nodded. “...For me...?” She  got another nod and turned to look at the car again, speechless.  “I...wow...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like it?” Nanoha asked, despite the smile on her  face. “I'm sorry I totaled your old one... I hope this makes up for  it...?” She followed Fate with her eyes as she walked around to the  front of the car and stood before her. “...Fate?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate shoved her  back onto the hood and jumped on top of her, pulling the girl up so she  was laying on it. The next moment she kissed her hard, moaning as her  tongue invaded her mouth. Ignoring the cheers around cat calls around  them, she instantly started her work unbuttoning Nanoha's shirt and  feeling her up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Get a ROOM!” Hayate complained, covering Elio's eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  ignored them as well, pulling Fate's jacket off and tugging her tucked  in shirt up so she could get her hands under it. Not a few moments  later and they were already on their way to starting to lose the rest  of their tops.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey look over here!” Sora called to them,  readying his camera. “You're going to be the front cover of next year's  hot rod magazine!” Both girls pulled away just long enough to pose  nearly topless on the car hood before going back at each other, only  stopping when Signum pulled the blond off of her lover.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Cover up!” She commanded the panting girls. “You're in public, geeze!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't  cover up,” Fate told Nanoha with a mischievous smirk. “Let's go home!”  She ran over to the car and smiled when Nanoha hopped in as well. After  a quick kiss she made the top come up and grinned at her lover. “I want  you naked by the time I get to the apartment.” With that she hit the  clutch, shifted gears, and sped out of the parking lot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno crossed his arms. “Ten bucks says they don't make it home before stopping.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No one took the bet.</span></p>

Next time...
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate:  My little boy has made his way back, and even brought with us knowledge  on our opponent as well as Lutecia into custody. We're reviewing her  crimes as well as her story and everything seems to match up. Since  this is a special case involving Relics, Hayate-chan was placed in  charge of the verdict. Lutecia, despite having given us valuable data,  is still a wanted criminal. If Elio say she can be trusted then I  believe him, but getting others to see it is a different matter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate:  Lutecia, we have found Jail Scaglietti's main base of operations thanks  to your help. If you'll assist us in his capture, I will clean your  record...All in the name of justice of course.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio: You mean it!? Lutecia's slate will be clean!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate: As if nothing ever happened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha:  Fate, we can't afford to mess this one up! Yuuno-kun's devices are  working properly now so the AMF won't effect us anymore! We have to end  this once and for all... For us, and for the future of this little girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate: The final battle...Nanoha, let's go. We will end it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia: What do you mean we can't come!?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate: The Stars and Lightning captains will go alone.</span></p>
