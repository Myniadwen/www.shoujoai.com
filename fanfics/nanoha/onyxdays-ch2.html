<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My internal alarm clock  never failed to wake me, even on my days off. Although I was thankful  for not having Bardiche wake me with the annoying beeping sounds, I  still was slightly annoyed at the disturbance from my own body. Even  though I was forced by my room mate to stay in bed most of the day  yesterday, I rarely got any sleep. The medicine Shamal shoved on me  made me really sleepy so I didn’t so much mind the staying in bed,  it was just that Nanoha tossed and turned all the time. Every ten  minutes the girl would moan and roll over, sometimes weakly pushing  me away for a while before pulling me close again. In all the time  we’ve spent together and shared a bed I had never once tugged the  covers or got annoyed with her sleeping habits. Last night, however,  I was <em>so</em> close to just giving up and sleeping on the couch.  Come to think of it, I was rather comfortable right now. I didn’t  feel my friend in bed at all, which kind of worried me. My eyes  opened slowly as I made myself sit up and look around to confirm that  I was, indeed, alone.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Onyx  Days II</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By:  Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate rolled her body  out of the bed and hazily made her way to the railing of her bedroom.  As she looked out over it into the living room she saw her target  sitting on the couch, half dressed. “Nanoha-chan…” The words  made the girl look up weakly. “I can’t believe you…” The  blond made her way down the stairs and over to the couch to where her  roommate was. “Get in bed this instant.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I need to train  them…” The blue eyed girl leaned forward, placing her face in her  hands and breathing heavily. “I can work…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You aren’t doing  anything but going to sleep.” Fate bent over and picked up the  girl, carrying her like a princess back to the stairs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan, I’m  better now…” Her head fell against the shoulder it was resting on  weakly. “Really…” Her voice broke lightly as she coughed. “Uh  oh…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Again!?” Fate  hurried the rest of the way to the bathroom and rubbed her back while  Nanoha had a coughing fit, having nothing left to throw up. “Honey,  if you eat something it will settle your stomach, you will stop doing  that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll just throw it  up instead of dry heaving…” She sniffed and sighed out weakly.  Moments passed as they waited to see if she was going to relapse but  when she didn’t seem to, Fate helped her to her feet. “Thank  you,” She managed to get out lightly before rinsing her mouth out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate frowned lightly at  her friend. Already her hair looked lifeless, despite just being  washed the day before. On top of this, the shirt she was wearing was  crinkled and had a light smell to it from the constant sweating  Nanoha seemed to be doing. “You need a shower, it’ll make you  feel better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you won’t let  me work, I just want to sleep…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The sheets need to  be changed too…” Fate rubbed her friend’s shoulders. “Come on  Honey, take a few minutes now and you’ll feel so much better for  the rest of the day…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Okay.” She  nodded lightly, obviously not really understanding what she just  agreed to.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here, let me…”  Fate undid the nightshirt buttons before taking it off of her friend.  The girl started to lean to the side lightly, and eventually had to  be braced by Fate before she collapsed onto the floor. “God  Nanoha-chan…Maybe I should contact Shamal again…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll… be fine…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You will, but I  still worry…” She helped the girl into the shower section of the  room. “You’re a lot weaker to these viruses than we are, if  you’re not careful you could really end up hurting yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Tough cookie.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes you are.”  Fate made sure her friend wouldn’t topple over before hurrying to  the medicine cabinet and getting her friend’s pills and her own  dose of liquid. “Take these, Hun.” She handed the pills over and  supervised the swallowing of them. “Good girl.” She turned on the  water and set the temperature to just a little over warm before  drinking her own medication. “Blech…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Feels nice…”  Nanoha murmured under the spray while sinking down and sitting on the  floor.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See?” Fate looked  at her a moment longer before speaking. “Do you want to enjoy that  while I change the sheets to the bed?” She received a small nod and  quickly left the room to finish the job before her friend deiced to  throw up in the shower or something.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When done with the  task, her friend was just as she had left her: hugging her knees with  her face buried in-between the kneecaps. Her wet hair covered half  her body, giving her an almost helpless look. “Hey,” she greeted  as she kneeled down in front of her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha looked up  sleepily, eyes glazed. “Hello,” was the reply. The girls touched  foreheads in an attempt to compare their body temperatures.  “Fate-chan, you have pretty eyes…” Nanoha smiled as best she  could.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blond looked a  little confused at the sudden compliment, but smiled back none the  less. Her mouth opened up to say something in return but found Nanoha  once again kissing her. It was a light kiss, their lips barely  seeming to touch, but the brown haired girl seemed to be trying the  best she could to do it. Fate instantly caved in to her desire and  put a hand on the back of her neck, kissing her back fully. When the  two pulled away, Nanoha gave her a cute grin. “Fate-chan taste good  too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Blushing, Fate moved  away before she gave in to the temptation of kissing the girl once  more. ‘<em>She’s sick,</em>’ Fate reminded herself as she started  to lather shampoo into her friend’s hair. ‘<em>She’s not  thinking straight, she’s on medication, I can’t be doing this…</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha mumbled out  something incoherent as the fingers danced on her head. Ever so  slowly the pampering was finished and the water cut off. The two  girls made it back to the bed where the sick one instantly crawled  under the covers. “Sleep with me?” She wondered instantly as she  reached out her hand towards Fate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry Nanoha-chan, I  need to go shopping.” Fate took the offered hand and gave it a  small squeeze. “Will you be okay by yourself for a few hours?”  She got a disappointed nod but felt her hand be squeezed back none  the less.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ne, Fate-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Keep calling me pet  names, I like those?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate paused a moment to  look at her before grinning and letting out a small laugh. “Okay,  okay. Well then, sweetheart, do you want anything from town?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No thank you,” She  closed her eyes and cuddled up against her body pillow. “Come back  soon please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.” The  blond nodded at her and even lovingly ruffled her hair before going  to get dressed.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Fate, you’re over  reacting.” Shamal sighed and rubbed the bridge of her nose. “She’s <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">sick</span></em>, of course she’ll be out of it, I told you when you  left she would be weird to deal with.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But she seems worse  today than she was yesterday!” Fate protested to the floating  monitor in front of her as she drove. “She’s been throwing up  every few hours and can’t even get out of bed by herself, and she’s  acting strange.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Strange how?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A dark blush came to  her cheeks. “Um, she’s saying weird things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Such as.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate coughed. “Hey,  Shamal?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just out of  curiosity, would Nanoha-chan do anything completely random? Say if  Yuuno came over and put her forehead against hers to check her  temperature… would she kiss him just because his face was close?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shamal looked at her  blankly before having a laughing fit. “No! No, no, why on earth  would she do that? Kissing someone just because they’re close, no.”  She tried to control her giggling. “She wouldn’t do anything like  that unless she wanted to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Wanted to…</em>’  Fate looked off to the side. ‘<em>She wanted to kiss me…</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh!” She looked  back towards Shamal. “I have to go now, thank you for listening.”  The girl cut off the display and parked her car at the grocery store  on the base. ‘<em>Calm down, Fate. You’re acting like a junior  high school girl!</em>’ The car door opened and she climbed outside.  ‘<em>I’m not going to get all giddy over this…</em>’ The walk  to the entrance was made briskly, a smile on her lips. ‘<em>Maybe I  should get her a get well teddy bear or something.</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As the woman walked  down the halls of the store her mind pondered just what she should  make for lunch and dinner. Several ideas passed through her head,  each one getting shot down since the girl probably wouldn’t be able  to eat any of it in her current condition. “How about curry?” A  voice suggested happily, making Fate blink. Curry would be the last  thing she’d want to feed a sick girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not too much  trouble?” Elio’s voice came up next and Fate paused where she  was, leaning over to look around the end of the isle. The two  Lightning squad members were standing together talking. The male of  the group was holding a shopping basket while his counter part was  putting things in it while thinking. “You really don’t have to…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You bought me  breakfast, the least I can do is make you dinner,” Carol replied  happily as she gripped his arm with one hand lightly and lead him  away. “Everyone shares a room but us, so isn’t this much better  than being alone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-yeah…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate couldn’t keep  the happy look off her face even if she wanted to. ‘<em>How sweet!</em>’  her mind thought as she walked away from them, not wanting to  interrupt their moment. ‘<em>My little boy has his first dinner  date!</em>’</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“I’m home,” Fate  greeted the empty living room as she opened the door and put the  groceries down in the kitchen. The items were unloaded and stocked  quickly before the girl grabbed the medium sized stuff animal she  bought and went to the shared bedroom. “Nanoha-chan?” The sick  girl wasn’t in bed so she walked over to the bathroom, which had  the door open. “Honey?” Looking in, Fate let out a startled gasp  and dropped the bear. “Nanoha! What’s wrong!?” she slid to a  stop next to the girl laying down on the floor and raised her top  half up to hold it. “Say something?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ughnnn…” The  girl weakly opened her eyes and blinked at Fate. “Welcome…back…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why are you in the  floor? Did you fall?” Fate moved the hair from her face. “Did you  get hurt?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No…” Nanoha’s  head fell against her shoulder and she closed her eyes. “I threw up  and couldn’t move so I just went to sleep here….”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh my god…” The  words stuck Fate hard, making slight tears come to her eyes. ‘<em>And  I was thinking about spending time with her happily… And she’s so  sick she can’t even get to the bed...</em>’ Sniffing slightly,  Fate lifted her up and carried her to the bed. “I’m sorry…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For what…?” She  looked relieved to be laying down again comfortably.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For being so  self-centered.” Fate gripped one of her hands with both of hers.  “I’m so sorry…” Gently she brought the hand she was holding  to her lips and kissed it. “I’ll take really good care of you for  now on, no matter what okay? Please give me another chance?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t understand…”  She looked like she was already going back to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry…”  Fate wiped her eyes, chest slightly in pain still. “I won’t get  distracted again, I’m here to make you better. Can I get you  anything? A drink? Want something to eat? Are you hot, cold?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rub my back?”  Nanoha opened one eye sleepily. “Please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course!” Fate  instantly moved to straddle her friend’s waist since she was lying  on her stomach. “I’ll rub it until you are content.” At once  her hand went to work, gently sliding over her back before pressing  down just hard enough to make the sick girl moan out in pleasure.  “I’ll do your arms and legs too, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmnn…” Time went  by quickly for the sick girl, staying in a stage of being half asleep  but also half awake at the same time. Her body felt relaxed and after  almost a complete hour of being rubbed she finally shifted so Fate  would get off of her and laid on her back happily. “Feel great  now…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you?” Fate took  turns rubbing her wrist to try and ease the sore muscles there. “You  need to eat something, do you think you can? I can make you whatever  you want?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right now I feel  like I could eat an entire cow…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blond couldn’t  help but laugh lightly. “That’s my girl. An entire cow sounds  good right now, but how about something a little easier on your  stomach?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A sandwich?”  Nanoha sat up but found herself being pushed back down gently. “Mou,  I want to get out of bed now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know you feel  pretty good right now but you’re still sick.” She smiled  apologetically. “You know how it is, you think you’re great one  moment then you suddenly collapse because you pushed yourself.”  Fate brought the covers back up to her chest. “Please stay in bed?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Okay.” She  smiled. “If you want me to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do,” Fate agreed  softly. “I’ll bring you some food so just take it easy.”  She  picked up the earlier disregarded stuffed animal and gave it to her.  “Here, I got this for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha smiled and took  the offered gift. “Thank you, it’s cute.” She hugged it to  herself. “I’ll name it Etaf.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Etaf?” The blond  gave her an amused look. “Your medicine must be kicking in again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just think about  it,” Nanoha yawned lightly and curled up with her new cuddle toy.  “I’ll be right here.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“I’m sorry,”  Nanoha whispered lightly as Fate laid her back in bed. “So sorry…”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay… Will  you be fine now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shush.” Fate  tucked her in. “I’m going to take a shower now so rest up okay?”  Nanoha gave her another scared look. “Really. I shouldn’t have  made you eat so much. Go to sleep.” Leaning over, Fate kissed her  forehead before going back to the bathroom and tossing a towel on the  floor. Stripping quickly, Fate went into the shower and turned on the  spray.  ‘<em>I needed to do laundry anyway…</em>’ The girl  shivered.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate rolled over in bed  and reached out to the nightstand lazily. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…Nine already</span></em>?<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">’ </span></em>She moaned lightly and rubbed her temples. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My head is  killing me…</span></em>’ Slowly she made her way out of bed and stumbled  over to the bathroom to raid her medicine cabinet. The dark liquid  was drunk bitterly before being followed by two tablets for her head.  ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Why am I so tired?</span></em>’ The way downstairs was trekked  hazily. There was just enough light still shining in to give her a  visible area without flipping the switch and she used it to raid the  pantry for some cookies. The girl leaned against the counter and  nibbled slowly, trying to rid herself of the medicine flavor. Once  she realized the jar was almost half gone she made herself stop  snacking and place the lid back on before heading back upstairs and  crawling into bed.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan…”  Nanoha sleepily looked at her. “Where did you go?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Got a cookie,” She  replied in a whisper. “Did I wake you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” She shook her  head against the pillow. “Just wondering.” Nanoha lifted her arm  up, requesting a hug. Once received, she kept the hold and buried  herself against Fate’s chest after sinking a little lower into the  covers. “I had another dream…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What about?” Fate  stroked her hair to try and sooth her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was in a cake  factory…” Her words started to drift off as she got comfortable.  “A bunch of blueberries were chasing me, and threw me in batter  when I was caught.” A yawn interrupted the story briefly. “An’  they tried to turn me into a muffin.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” Fate  smiled, very much amused. “Did you get cooked?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nuh uh,” She shook  her head lightly, making Fate’s chest itch slightly from her hair.  “I got away, but they yelled at me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw,” She cooed  sympathetically. “What did they say?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know; I  couldn’t understand them… They all had French accents.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate smiled happily.  “Don’t worry, I’ll protect you from the French blueberries.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?” Nanoha  looked up at her, obviously more asleep than awake. “Promise?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good,” She looked  content now and closed her eyes. “Because I don’t want to be  eaten.” The brown haired girl got comfortable and gripped Fate’s  shirt lightly to be sure she wouldn’t go anywhere. “But if Fate  wanted to eat my muffin, I’d let her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” She  kissed her hair, ignoring how wrong that just sounded. “Sweet  dreams.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate awoke next to the  now familiar feeling of Nanoha weakly pushing at her. The blond  looked over to the side and watched Nanoha move away from her, still  asleep. Now with almost two feet between them, she stretched out  groggily. Deciding to go back to sleep, she closed her eyes and  swallowed thickly, ignoring the tickling feeling in the back of her  throat. Moments passed before a soft beeping sound made her look back  up. A display hung over her, showing Shamal’s name. “Computer,  answer.” She muttered, too tired to reach up and activate it by  ‘touch’. “Hey Shamal.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re still in  bed?” she greeted, amazed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What time is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Almost eleven.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?” Fate looked  to the side, noticing that the storm didn’t seem to be over. Dark  clouds covered the sky, blocking the sunlight. “Ugh, I’m  exhausted…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then I won’t keep  you long. Have you been taking your medicine?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, and so has  Nanoha.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How’s her  temperature?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate lazily moved one  hand over to feel of her friend’s neck. “Hot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And yours?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl put her hand  on her own neck. “I’m a little warm too actually… maybe I  should turn the air conditioner up a little…” Fate moved to get  out of bed but only managed to take two steps before pausing and  giving Shamal a worried look. Before the doctor could ask, Fate ran  across the room and into the bathroom, where she quickly started  rinsing her mouth out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate, are you okay?”  Shamal suddenly got serious and lost her happy go lucky expression.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I…I think so.”  She panted a moment, looking at herself in the mirror. “I’m a  little pale…” Quickly she opened the cabinet and drank the  medicine straight form the bottle, frowning at the taste. “I slept  almost twelve hours, why am I so tired…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate, come to my  office okay? I want to give you a brief check up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At first the girl  looked like she was going to oppose, but a sudden weird feeling in  her stomach made her reconsider. “Okay, I’ll be in shortly.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Just as I  thought...” Shamal sighed sadly. “Fever, clammy skin, dilated  eyes, tiredness, blood pressure is off… You’re sick.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not sick,”  she protested stubbornly. “I took the medicine just like you said,  if anything I took it more than I needed to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Which is why I’m  so confused…You should be absolutely fine, even if you’re staying  in the same room with her… Even if you’re in the same bed you  were spaced apart more than enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She normally clings  on me,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wait, what?”  Shamal blinked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha curls up on  me when she sleeps.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So when you said she  wouldn’t let go of you the other day, you meant she was <em>on</em> you and not just, say, holding your hand or laying on your lap?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate suddenly found  herself nervous. “She kept her face close to mine...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shamal pieced things  together rather quickly after hearing that. “Oh my word, when you  asked me that earlier it was because she kissed you didn’t she?”  she received a small nod. “Fate I’m really happy that you two  like each other, you make a great couple, but kissing someone who has  the flu and letting them breath on your face will get you sick no  matter what medicine you have…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blond leaned  forward and sighed. “Great. Just great. I already take three days  off to take care of Nanoha, now I’ll be out for another four  probably… Nanoha still can’t even get out of bed for more than  ten minutes before wanting to lay down again…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll contact  Chrono and see if I can’t get Yuuno to come instruct the members of  your squad, at least get them some nice battle formations. For now I  want both of you to stay in bed, drink lots of liquids, and Fate  please for the love of god, don’t be kissing each other until  you’re well again okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Yes ma’am.”  She blushed lightly. “I’ll take real good care of her, I  promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Take care of <em>yourself</em> too.” She went to a cabinet and took out a large  bottle and popped the cap on it. “Take two of these twice a day.”  She placed the pills into a smaller bottle and scribbled on the  label. “Throw away the liquid you have, it won’t be useful  anymore.”</span></p>
