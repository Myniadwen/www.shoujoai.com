<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Groaning I  looked over the top of Nanoha's head and into the dark room we were in.  Despite the alarm clock above the bed telling me that it was  seven-thirty in the morning, it still felt felt as if it was the dead  of night. The window curtains were closed but there was almost no light  to be blocked out thanks to the rainclouds hanging thick in the sky. I  was so tempted to simply hug the girl in front of me and go back to  sleep but I knew I couldn't. There was too much to do today and we  really needed to get back to my summer house to start. With any luck we  could start planning how exactly we were going to fight the people we  were up against and maybe even get an update about Nanoha's eyesight  from Shamal as well. Of course I had to get out of bed before any of  this could happen, but Nanoha was sleeping so soundly... Closing my  eyes, I cuddled up against her and sighed out contently. Well, maybe  five more minutes wouldn't hurt anything...</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By: Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  quickly opened the door to her house and ushered Nanoha inside before  closing her umbrella and shaking off the rain on it. “What a day to  rain,” she complained more to herself than her friend but still got a  reply back anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I thought you liked rain, miss storm lover.”  Standing where she was, she looked around the house even though she  couldn't actually see it. “This is the same house you stayed in when  you were younger right? After you moved out of your apartment?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  is,” Fate's voice trailed off, seeing only Elio and Caro awake. “Mou,  we hurried all the way here and everyone is still asleep?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  youngest girl in the room turned and smiled at her commander.  “Hayate-san told us to sleep in and rest since the first few days would  be our vacation.” She yawned loudly before she could continue though.  “The time difference here is weird so we didn't end up going to bed  until way late in the morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can you show me to our room?”  Nanoha asked casually before Fate trotted off to do her own thing. “I  want to change clothes, please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, this way Honey.” Fate took  her hand and began to guide her around the living room while trying her  best to describe everything to her at the same time. “Stairs,” She  placed her fiancé's hand on the rail and was pleased to see Nanoha go  up them simply without worry. Once near the top the girl slowed down  slightly and took her time to make sure she wouldn't over balance like  before and soon found herself standing at the top with a proud grin on  her face. “You're already adapting,” Fate whispered so only they could  hear. “That's my girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Flirt,” She accused back as the blond  started to guide her to their room. The door was opened for her and  after stepping in she was greeted at once by a cheerful cry from her  friends. “Arisa!” she exclaimed brightly, opening her arms for a hug  and getting it seconds later. “Hey! You stayed the night here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We did,” She replied back while giving her one more hug before jumping onto Fate as well. “Oh sweet Jesus, Fate you <em>did</em> cut your hair! I thought Suzuka was lying!” Looking back and forth  between the two her eyes slowly drifted off back to Nanoha, who was  simply smiling. “So, it's true? Nanoha?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,” She replied  softly, knowing what she was referring to. Bracing for another hug, she  was startled to find a finger poking her chest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How stupid do  you have to be, huh?” Arisa demanded of her. “Getting defeated!  Honestly! I thought you was the 'Ace of Aces' there!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha puffed out her cheeks angrily. “Well ex<em>cuse</em> me for being human! The guy took out my entire team as well, it wasn't like I just keeled over and died!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well  you should have tried harder or retreated or something!” She went on.  “Mou, what am I going to tell my friends now after bragging about you  so much?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wait, you have friends?” Nanoha acted surprised.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course I do!” Arisa shouted back at her in mid glaring contest. Several  seconds passed by between them before both girls lost their anger and  hugged each other again. “I missed you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You too.” Nanoha smiled, pleased at being able to vent a little of her anger out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  started to change clothes for the day after digging through her large  duffel bag. “I'm going to wake up Hayate and start on breakfast for  everyone, need anything before I go off?” The girls shook their heads,  leaving her free to do as she desired. “Arisa, let's catch up once I'm  done cooking okay?” She got a nod and left the three to talk amongst  themselves. As the blond walked down the hall she casually trailed her  fingers along the wall until she made it to the room at the end.  Peeking in, she saw the form of Hayate's body and smiled to herself for  getting it right on the first try. “Hayate?” she asked gently as she  walked across the room. “Wake up, I need help cooking for  so...many...people?” Her words slowly trailed off, mouth hanging open  at the sight. Her best friend was laying quite literally on top of her  best male friend, arm around his chest and knee brought up to his  thighs. To top off everything Hayate had a dreamy smile on her face and  was slightly drooling on Yuuno's chest. '<em>Oh man,</em>' Fate thought to herself as she used Bardiche and the house's M2D to bring up her camera screen. '<em>Payback is a bitch, Hayate</em>.'</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“So  what do you want to do?” Tia wondered aloud as she looked around the  city. The group of Stars and Lightning members were currently in the  middle of a park, apparently the same on where Nanoha first ran into  Yuuno. The van driven by Fate drove off after a quick wave to them and  headed back towards the house leaving them alone to have fun for the  day. Looking up, Tia sheltered her eyes from what little sunlight was  peeking through the damp clouds overhead. “Nanoha-san said there was a  water park nearby but I don't want to risk ruining our day if it rains  again. Maybe we should sightsee?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I want to see what school Mommy and Fate-san went to,” Caro mused aloud as she thought about it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru grinned. “Oh that would be interesting! The top three Ace's old school! Maybe we could find yearbooks!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  leader of the pack had to suppress a grin. “Okay, I'm game.” holding up  her device, she spoke softly to it. “Cross Mirage, have you managed to  adapt to the environment on this planet?” She was given a short  affirmative answer, making her smile. “Can you display and find  information?” Again she was confirmed, making the group cheer out.  “Thank you. Load portable M2D and connect with the house please.” This  time a small screen appeared in front of her. “Display directions from  here to whatever school Nanoha and Fate went to as children.” The  screen remained still for several moments as it searched the limited  availability of Earth's 'Internet' mixed with the personal database of  the requested people. Finally a map appeared before them, getting  smiles all around.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Okay,  so, what's the deal?” Arisa finally asked after everyone settled down  quietly back at the house. “It was kind of obvious you wanted the group  of students away for a while. Can we get filled in?” Looking over at  Suzuka she got a short nod. “I understand military protocol and such,  but I don't think it will really matter here on Earth? Speaking of...”  For the first time since she arrived she gave Nanoha a soft caring  look. “...How could anyone beat Nanoha-chan?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl in question  looked down sadly, hunched over with her hands clasped. “It was  insane,” She finally revealed as Raising Heart displayed a floating  monitor for them to replay the battle. “It was like... Fighting a  god... I couldn't even touch him.” She listened to the battle taking  place and cringed when she heard her own pain filled scream. “That  move... Why does he know it?” Looking over towards the general area of  the group, she closed her eyes. “That's Skeith's move... she gave it to  me before she started to sleep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can you ask her?” Fate looked  over at her lover as she pet the puppy form of Arf sitting in her lap.  “We would like to know that as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha shook her head  sadly. “She's asleep; Aura only wakes when my life is threatened and  only long enough to make sure I'm okay. Other than that, it's as if she  isn't alive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno licked his lips. “Skeith is a program,” His  childhood partner looked over at him, not liking his words. “I know she  has a soul, Nanoha, I'm not implying otherwise. But...still, she's like  an advanced version of Rein.” Looking over at the small girl sitting on  Hayate's shoulder he offered a small smile. “Man I always feel like a  creep when I say that because I see her as a real person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rein  is Rein,” She confirmed for him happily. “I know I'm a program, it  doesn't bother me. My friends treat me as a person, that's all that I  need to make me happy.” To prove her point she flew over to Yuuno and  sat on his shoulder instead. “Where is this going?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was hoping  to find some way to activate Skeith's program so we could find out more  information on this.” Yuuno spoke again, glancing around to different  people as he did so. “All we know is the people we're up against use a  type of Unison Device to allow them their power. Unlike you, Rein, it  seems to merge with them completely. So much so that they actually  refer to themselves in a plural sense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anyway,” Hayate interrupted him. “We know how they get their power and we have a counter measure for it...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why do you say it like that?” Fate sighed. “This is another one of those insanely risky things, isn't it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Suzuka swallowed. “Is it that bad?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly  Hayate nodded. “Yuuno and I have talked about this for a while now,  trying to gather data before talking to you about it. So far we only  came up with two solutions...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...And?” Nanoha pondered when nothing was spoken for a while.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“One, we fight them before they load a linker core or prevent them from loading one once we start fighting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  stared at the direction Yuuno was in for a long moment, trying to  decide if he was serious or not. “Gee, way to hit the nail on the head  there Yuuno-kun. Tell me, what insanely brilliant second plan did you  come up with?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Fight them when they have mana burn after they already loaded a core.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're <em>kidding</em>!?” Nanoha acted shocked. “Come <em>on</em> Yuuno-kun! Be serious here!” She was answered with silence, leaving her  a moment before slowly hanging her head. “We don't stand a snowball's  chance in hell do we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Suzuka reached out to her friend and was  rewarded with a slow hug from her. “Hey, don't worry, you've done  things before that were slim right? If we have a while to plan then  surely we can come up with something that will give us an edge right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  slowly nodded in the embrace. “Mm...Yuuno-kun and Hayate-chan have  never let me down before, I'm just a little touchy I suppose.” She felt  her back being rubbed and sighed out at the feeling. “Thanks, I'm  better now.” Taking a large breath, she calmed down. “What about the  AMF?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate nodded at the idea while petting Arf's puppy form in  her lap. “Yeah, what do you think about that? Would they be immune to  it like Jail was?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Jail was telekinetic, not magical.” Hayate  reminded them. “He did the research, but I don't know if the main  branch also continued it. Not many planets have magical energy you  know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno leaned forward. “It's worth a shot. I have the  device after all, and your barrier jackets have been equipped with the  neutralizing frequency. I don't know how much it will take their power  down, nor how long it will last before they find the device, but it's  worth a shot. No sooner than did the words leave his mouth than a  monitor appeared in the air between them all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hayate!” Carim's image looked panicked on the screen. “Our databases were hacked last night! Teleportation logs were copied!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>What</em>!?”  Hayate leaned forward and slammed her hands on the table in front of  her. “How did this happen!? Who did it!?” The screen stayed silent  despite her yelling so she tried again. “Carim, who-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The U.F.Q most likely,” the screen picked up again. “ We fear that-” Her voice stopped, blinking. “Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno  put his hand on Hayate's shoulder. “There's a long delay, you'll have  to wait before talking again.” Turning to the screen, he spoke to the  woman. “Did they get our location?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Carim replied shortly. “Yes,  they know you are on non-administrated planet number ninety-seven. They  don't have your exact location so if you lay low and don't call  attention to yourself then you should be okay if you stay indoors.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Arisa  swallowed. “Um, this may not be the best time to say this but...  Lutecia, I think her name was, said something about Tia being on the  news stopping some type of robbery this morning...” Fate looked over  and met Hayate's eyes in fear.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Subaru  slowly pushed herself up amongst the rubble and coughed out the dust  she had inhaled. Her vision swam, mind working quickly to try and  figure out why she was in pain. She had just been standing, not fifteen  seconds ago, talking with everyone as they looked around the track  field of Nanoha's old school. Now she was slowly pulling herself up  from amidst the broken bleachers. “Wha...” She coughed again, seeing  rubble shift as Tia stood. “What... What happened?” Tia didn't answer  her at first, already jumping over piles of broken metal and wood to  find the other members and make sure they were okay. '<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">How can she recover so fast?</span></em>'  The words ran through the blue haired girl's mind quickly as she looked  up into the air out of habit from fighting against Nanoha “Tia!  Topside!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Such a slow reaction time,” A voice floated down to them,  slowly lingering over the field as the group scrambled to gather. “I  expected more from the students of the top flying Ace.” Slowly the  figure sank down onto the ground and crossed his arms. “ I wonder if  this will even be worth my time?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia observed the man in front  of them slowly, taking in everything she could to try and figure out  exactly who he was and a weakness, if any. The man had long white hair  flared back freely behind his back. Blue eyes glared at them, matched  by the exact same type of armor that the Azure Flame wore. “Who are  you?” She finally spoke, Barrier Jacket flaring to life around her  skin. “Why have you attacked us?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They call me Balmung... of the  Azure Sky.” Balmung smirked at them, pulling out a large broad sword  type device. “If you do not surrender peacefully I will do more than  harm you. A hostage would be nice but is not required.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio  gripped Strada and stood ahead of his fellow lightning members. With  his spear in front of him, he narrowed his eyes and spoke. “Azure Sky,  the same type of name Tri-Edge had. He was probably sent here to kill  the others?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru swallowed. “How... how can we fight someone  on par with the guy who beat Nanoha fully powered...” Her eyes widened  as Balmung slowly inserted a small round gem into his sword. “Is  that...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Balmung smirked, blasting the gem into his device. “Load Linker core!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Affirmative!” His device held a thick accent to it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  Caro could see again, she realized that the simple act of loading the  energy source had knocked them all back several feet from where they  had been standing previously. “... I'm scared...” Her shaking hands  were soon comforted by another gripping it firmly. Following it up to  it's owner, she found Lutecia looking at her with a determined  expression. Caro nodded at her after a few seconds and turned to glare  back at the man, for the first time noticing that Elio was still in  front of them even after taking the brunt of the blow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Listen,”  Tia whispered softly so only they could hear her words. Balmung was  slowly walking towards them as they gripped their weapons. “I can't  promise you that we will survive this.” She closed her eyes for just a  moment. “If you want to run, I will distract him so you can get away.  There is no shame in a strategic retreat; I won't force any of you to  put your life on the line in this battle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She's right,” Subaru  stood next to Tia and loaded rifle sized shells into the glove her  lover had made for her. “You can make it back while we keep his  attention.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio scoffed to himself. “I'm not going anywhere.” Shifting his stance, he prepared to strike. “We're a team.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia  stood on the other side of the boy, lifting her hands and forming a  magic circle for support under her. “You accepted me without  questions... I will not turn my back on you, no matter the cost.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally  Caro walked forward as well, twin circles appearing under her feet. “My  dragons... Bless my knight with the armor of frost, and my team with  the mist of protection.” The roars of vanishing dragons echoed  somewhere in the skies as the magic keeping them on Earth changed to  enchant those around her. The Dragoon Knight was instantly frozen over,  graced in armor that looked to be completely made out of ice. Although  it had a form around his normal barrier jacket, the exact details could  not be made out, as it was mostly translucent. The rest of them were  covered lightly in a type of silver glowing fog that clung to their  bodies. “My protection may not last long against him,” She warned. “But  it's the best I can do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia's lips turned up into a proud smirk  as her eyes trained back onto the man in front of them who was now  preparing to strike. “Thank you, all of you.” Narrowing her eyes, she  contacted the group mentally. “<em>Here's what I need you to do to win this!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  group scattered at once, running quickly away from the attack that was  launched at them. The area they had just been standing was gone now,  simply vaporized from the sword swing. “Oh?” Balmung mused, turning  around and grinning at the several blast of magic that were absorbed  into the barrier surrounding him. “So you will put up a fight?”  Glancing to his side, he noticed Elio seem to phase into view across  from him before vanishing again and reappearing on his other side.  “This should be interesting to say the least.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru's fist  slammed hard against the barrier in front of Balmung, glove crackling  furiously as a spent shell was ejected from it's holder. She seemed to  be three complete feet away from the man, fighting a barrier that she  herself could only project mere inches from her skin. Jumping back, she  avoided a slash of the sword and landed in a crouch. She gripped her  arm tightly, panting in pain as light blood trickled from between her  fingers. “I'm fine!” she yelled before Tia could be distracted. Looking  down, she winced at the cut. '<em>He wasn't even close to getting me and yet he did this much damage from a miss?Even with Caro's dragon barrier...'</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio  once again flashed across the battlefield as Tia emptied her guns  quickly, streaming several shots up and above the man in an attempt to  find a weak spot in the shield. Her guns, although empty of shells,  still fired as fast as she could pull the triggers. The gunslinger  noticed that the magic wasn't being drained from her but instead came  from from Caro. “I can't summon while having two active dragon  enchants,” The young one gasped out as she continued to pump magical  energy into everyone to increase their abilities. “This is all I can  do!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia danced around the man outside of the barrier as Elio  flashed over them yet again. Trying to find a spot to attack from, she  sent several small insets through the shield only to have them  vaporized from the magic radiating from within. “I can't get any  through!” She cried as Balmung kicked his foot out. Although missing  her by four feet, she still flew through the air and dug a trench into  the ground where she landed. “Ah...Ahn...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lulu!” Elio forced  himself not to rush over to her, instead blurring his speed as he ran  across the battle area. Leaping over the man, he focused all the energy  Caro had sent him and loaded a shell to enforce it. The spear tip  bounced off the top of the barrier just as it had been.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Balmung  glanced to the side, seeing Elio once again appearing on his other  side. “My dear boy, what are you trying to do?” turning his attention  to Tia, he focused himself on dodging her bullets and allowed a few to  be absorbed by his protection. With a quick slash he sent Subaru  railing through the air and into the dirt, sliding far in the dust.  “Hahaha, this is too much fun! Like a cat playing with it's mouse  before consuming it!” His world flipped around as the ground beneath  him blasted into the sky. Balmung nimbly ran across the raising spike  of stone and lashed out against the purple summoner.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What I  desire!” Lutecia flew into the air and twirled around an attack. “Water  of deception!” Balmung's sword sliced clean through the girl's body,  grinning at the sudden surprised look and dead blank eyes of the  defeated insect queen. Landing, he took a startled look as the two body  parts flashed into water, covering both himself and the ground. “I  desire,” Lutecia spoke from afar as Elio lashed forward again. “A flow  of lightning from within!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Balmung laughed as the electricity  flared around him, not breaking the shield that Elio once again bounced  off of. “Such pathetic attempts!” Despite the power radiating around  him being able to floor most double-A mages in one hit, he simply  blasted Lutecia back into the ground when she was finished channeling  her energy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lulu!” Elio blurred again, catching her body before  slamming into the broken bleachers. “Are you okay?” Holding her  tighter, her noticed that she felt rather soft in his arms and  unconsciously squeezed her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“E-Eli-chan!” Lutecia blushed darkly,  making Elio realize that he had been feeling up her chest. “I-I don't  mind but this... this is hardly the time!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn't mean to!”  Pulling back he let her go and grabbed his spear, tripping over himself  in an attempt to gain some distance from the blushing girl</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia growled, shouting at him. “Elio, pay attention!” Frowning, she looked back at her opponent. '<em>Damn puberty messing up my team...' </em>Despite  being wide open for attack nothing came, as Balmung was too busy  laughing at them. The leader smirked, loading two more rounds into her  twin pistols and unloading what she could. '<em>That's it, just keep being cocky.</em>'  She had to leap to the side as she was charged, feeling her barrier  jacket almost vaporize from the close encounter. Skidding to a halt,  she inspected the damage and frowned at her bruised leg. A tackle came  next, and she rolled across the ground with her Stars partner to avoid  another close swing of the massive broadsword. “Subaru!” The blue  haired girl panted, clutching her side and withering in agony from the  attack she just took to cover her partner. “Let me see!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!” Subaru screamed loudly. “Fight! I'll be fine!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But-”  Her words were barely audible over the roar of fire summoned by  Lutecia, followed by another attempt to sneak in poisoned wasps.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“GO!”  The injured girl cried desperately.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia  forced back the feeling and ran, shooting both guns as fast as she  could. “Hey! Over here!” She glared at him as she was looked at,  allowing Elio to once again make his journey. She bent herself  backwards and saw the sword sail above her. Ignoring the blinding rush  of energy around her she shot several times, creating a smoke cloud  around them. “<em>Caro! Please! Everything you have!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I'm at my limit!</em>” The dragon princess sobbed out as she fell to her knees. “<em>Too much! Four people is too much!</em>” with her shaking hands, she forced the remaining energy from her linker core into both Tia and Elio.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia  slid along the ground as she got into position, summoning a swarm of  flies around her so thick she couldn't see through them. “Go, my  darlings,” She requested of them softly. “Confuse him!” Pushing out her  hands, she felt her body stagger. “<em>Tia... I summoned enough to buy you some time...</em>” Falling to her knees, she forced herself to stay up the rest of the way. '<em>I can't fall yet! There's one more thing I have to do!</em>'</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Balmung  looked around at the insects buzzing around him, feeling Elio flash  above him again. Despite the interference he managed to see the  movement and threw out his hand to counter. The scream was loud,  bringing a smile to his face as chunks of ice fell. Several more blast  hit his shield but the combination of smoke and flies made him stop to  look for the new direction they were coming from. “Go <em>away</em>!”  Slashing out his hand, he enveloped the area around him in a thick  fire, burning most of the insects in the process. Now free to see  slightly, his eyes widened at the sight of Elio landing in front of  him. His body was covered again, green and purple armor gracing his  jacket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Knight attack:” He began, the smirk evident on his face  as Strada cracked over it's entire body from the force of the attack  just delivered. “The God that Failed!” Lutecia collapsed across from  him, leaving the armor to shatter as well. Balmung looked up finally,  seeing the scratched and cracked area in his barrier above his head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You...!  All this time...!?” His eyes narrowed angrily, building up a ball of  energy in his hand and thrusting it forward at the boy. “Damn you!” The  blast hit it's mark, but he had no time to see the damage done. Looking  up, he gasped at the sight of Tia flying straight down at him. “This is  madness!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia pointed her shotgun at the top of the barrier and  fired the moment she was about to collide with it. The force of the  attack finally shattered a hole in the barrier where all five of them  had been concentrating their attacks. Falling through it, Tia reared  back a hand in a punch and threw it at Balmung's face. As expected it  was caught firmly within his own fist. Not letting up, Tia twisted her  body around and lashed her foot out. Balmung lifted his leg to absorb  the shock of it almost instantly, dropping his sword and predicting the  next attack before it even came. Tia flipped her body over upside down  and threw out her other foot to connect with the man's shoulder, only  to have it caught by Balmung's now free hand. “Checkmate,” Tia stated  as she hung upside down in his grasp, black and red version five of  Cross Mirage placed directly on the man's chest. His eyes went wide as  the trigger was pulled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The world blurred around her as the blast  shot, heat searing through her jacket and burning her skin. There was a  scream but she didn't know if it was from him or herself, maybe a  combination of both. Everything Caro had given her was gone, the shells  in her barrel emptied. Cross Mirage was already draining her, sucking  the energy from her body to complete the task. The feeling in her hand  spread, snapping sharply once she realized what it was. Firing the  fifth stage one handed hand instantly fractured the bones in her hand,  spreading back into her wrist and arm, moving up in splintering lines  to her shoulder which was now out of socket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One body hit the  ground, Tia falling first onto the back of her neck and shoulders and  then continuing to collapse onto her back. Looking up in agony, she saw  the body of Balmung above her, taking a few staggering steps away from  her before falling to his knees and then onto his face. Panting, she  watched for any signs of movement, but saw nothing other than the  pained signs of breathing. The man's eyes met hers then, his lips  turning up into a sick smile and laughing. “Ha...ha...ha...ha...  Well... played...” Grunting, he coughed blood. “Kite was...right... My  arrogance... <em>was</em>...the death... of me...” Looking at her harder, he gave one final smirk. “But you... you're coming... with me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tiaaaa!”  Subaru's scream invaded the Stars member's ears as a thick black slime  erupted from Balmung's body and latched onto her. All at once she heard  screaming inside her head, pain covering her body as the ooze tried to  consume her. “Tia! Tia!” Subaru's voice was desperate now, hands  grasping at the black substance and slinging it away from her. Ripping  and tearing, the close quarters fighter shredded her way into the  avatar trying to kill her partner. Finally, after several pain staking  seconds, the ooze stayed still. “Tia...Tia...! Answer me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Suba...ru...” Tia weakly opened her eyes as the enemy on her fell away from her body as if it was never there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh  god... I was so scared...” Leaning over, she gently tried to touch her  but had to stop when her partner winced. “What is it?” Her voice was  almost high pitched, scared for her life.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shoulder...” The word instantly made Subaru's hands grip her, snapping it back into socket instantly. “Owwwwwwwwww!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Subaru!  Tia!” A new voice screamed loudly from the air, Fate dropping to the  ground so hard her boots dug into the dirt, forming two small trenches.  “ Are you okay!?” Her eyes instantly widened at the amount of blood  stained on Subaru's battle uniform.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia looked over at her and smiled as best she could. “We... won... Fate...-san...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Lightning leader quickly scanned the area and accounted for everyone  still moving. Finally she leaped over them and inspected the body.  “...The Azure Sky.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Balmung weakly opened his eyes, staring up at  Fate with what little energy he had left before dieing. “Even though I  die...” His voice was so weak Fate had to lean closer to hear him. “My  job was completed... Nanoha...will be dead... before you get there...”  With those last words, his head turned to the side and stared  lifelessly at nothing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate stared at him in disbelief for a full  four seconds before turning sharply on her squadron. “Report!” No words  came to her ears so she tried again. “Damn it I said<em> report</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma'am.” Elio tried his best, understanding why she was so desperate. “Lulu and I will make it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro weakly opened her eyes, dust blowing softly as she panted, face still on the ground. “I'll... be okay...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru nodded at Fate, still too worried about her partner. Tia, seeing this, spoke as best she could. “Go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate gave them all a regretful look before turning and blasting into the air again back towards where she had just came from. '<em>If anything happens to Nanoha I'll...</em>'  She couldn't finish the thought, already pushing herself to her limit  of flying speed. “Bardiche,” She spoke to her device as she spun in the  air to try and even out the air turbulence she just passed through.  “Contact the house!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Connection terminated,” The weapon told her simply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Contact Nanoha!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Raising Heart's address is unavailable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Hayate</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The Tome of the Night Sky's address is-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“YUUNO!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The Book of One-Thousand's address is unavailable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate choked on her air, pushing harder. '<em>No... Please, God, no!'</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“I  can't keep still much longer,” Nanoha looked around nervously despite  not being able to see. Sitting on the couch, she rubbed her hands  together while tapping her heel on the floor.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You haven't been still  since Fate left,” Yuuno told her, pressing his hand down on her leg to  keep her from bouncing it up and down so quickly. “Calm down, they only  know what town we're in, if that. To be able to track us down enough to  battle would take way too much luck.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don't believe in  luck,” Nanoha stated as she looked to where the voice was coming from.  “There is no such thing as luck, only statistics, right?” She heard a  soft chuckle under the male's breath and took small confidence from it.  “Can you contact her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate sighed. “Nanoha-chan, she <em>just</em> left, can't you wait ten minutes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  girl fumed up at her, accidentally petting Arf too hard and getting a  small bark. “Sorry,” She spoke down to her before talking back to her  friend. “I do it all the time when I'm nervous, she's used to it by  now. Activate battle filter and contact please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine,” Hayate  raised her hands and got a display in front of herself. Ignoring Suzuka  and Arisa's amazed looks, she tapped a few buttons in the air. “Battle  filter set.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Suzuka leaned over to Yuuno ans whispered lightly to him while Hayate tried to connect. “What's 'battle filter' mean?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  short, it means if whoever's weapon is engaged, the call won't go  through unless you use an emergency contact. That way we know if it's  safe to talk to someone or not.” He got a slight hum from his friend so  he turned back to the brown haired girl across from him. “What's taking  so long?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate frowned. “I don't think you set up the connection right here, the call isn't going through.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno blinked. “It <em>has</em> to be set up right, we've used it already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well it's <em>obviously</em> not working <em>now</em> is it?” She put her hands on her hips and frowned at the display. “How  odd... Contact Nanoha, please.” The screen lit up in a red error  message almost instantly, declaring that the frequency was unavailable.  “What's going on...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sshh!” Nanoha put a finger to her lips and  shushed them quickly. Time ticked by slowly as they all tried in vain  to hear what the girl had become so serious over. “You hear that?” her  own voice quieted down to nothing more than a whisper. “The humming  sound...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno's eyes lit up, quickly grabbing the two civilians  by putting an arm over each of their shoulders and hastily leading them  away. “Be quiet and be prepared to run,” He told them harshly in a  whisper. “We're trapped in a barrier, when they are attacked we are  going to make a break for it. Once at the end, I'll hack the shield and  let you two out before returning to battle. Don't go home, just find a  crowded place and stay there.” His words were barely finished before a  light knocking came on the door, shattering the silence that hung  around the room. Staying as still as he could, the blond man backed the  girls up to a wall and tried to stay in front of them as best he could,  hands gripping their wrist in preperation to drag them to safety. Again  the knocking came, slower this time and much louder. Swallowing, he  looked over at Hayate and got a short nod back. Both of their barrier  jackets sprang to life at once. Hayate fused with Rein quickly,  kneeling down and holding out her staff. Slowly energy began to gather  into a ball at the tip. Circulating over itself, the magic grew larger  as she laid in wait.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The next few moments happened so fast it  seemed to click by in still frames in Yuuno's mind. The door burst open  all at once, allowing a man entrance to their home uninvited. The next  scene was Hayate screaming loudly as she fired her blast, followed by  her face being gripped by the man's large hand. Nanoha was screaming  demands to know what was happening, the two girls behind him freezing  in place despite his pleads to move. Hayate was already losing her  battle, overpowered even without her limiter on. Nanoha made her move,  pleading for her friends to run to safety. It was then that they  finally moved and allowed the male to almost literally drag them  outside. The seconds flashed by quickly, each one making him try harder  at breaking the code to grant them access to the field's power. Hayate  was fighting, Nanoha was screaming, Suzuka was crying, Arisa was  yelling...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally it cracked, Yuuno broke through the barrier  and formed a hole to shove his friends through. He didn't say anything  to them after pushing them out, only turning around and running back  inside. Hayate was already laying on the couch, beaten but breathing.  Leaping into action, he grabbed Nanoha around the waist and pulled her  out of the way of one of the man's blast. “It's me!” He whispered  desperately into his friend's ear when she struggled to break free of  his hold. “Sweetie it's me, don't worry!” He tried to calm her as best  he could, shielding them both from an attack but getting thrown back  into the wall from the force of it. “We're getting out of here!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think not!” The man was already in front of them, raising his hand and forming another attack.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  heard Yuuno's cry of pain and a soft thunk next to her. Panting, she  looked in front of herself, eyes wide yet unseeing. It was quiet again,  the only sounds coming from Yuuno's groaning body and Hayate's weak  attempts to stand. Her breath echoed around her, heart pounding in her  ears. She heard laughter, taunts thrown at he as she slashed out  Raising Heart in an attempt to hit the man. Her body ached, mind  demanding her to gain distance and fire from mid to long range, to  claim her spot in the air. She pressed down the urge, knowing she could  hurt her friends drastically if she acted too quickly. '<em>Skeith!</em>' She flexed the fingers on her right hand. '<em>Help me! I need you</em>!' Out of no where a magical blast hit her, life saved only by Raising Heart's auto barrier. '<em>Find me! Skeith!</em>' sliding on the floor, she tried to look around, to find Hayate and try and help her. '<em>Skeith! Aura! Listen to me! Find me!</em>'  Again she was hit by a blast, feeling her barrier jacket shred from it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate's  voice suddenly came to her ears, telling her to run to the right and  escape. The sounds of battle sprang up again, this time lasting for  almost a minute before Hayate's voice died down again. “Now just one  more,” The man spoke, snapping Nanoha's attention to the direction it  was coming from.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come and get me!” She taunted him, finally  running where Hayate told her to and ramming her right shoulder roughly  against the door frame as she made it outside and into the air. “Catch  me if you can!” she felt the presence follow her, forcing her to fly  faster away, in any direction she could. She didn't know which way was  up, down, or anything in between anymore. All that mattered was the man  was with her and not harming her friends anymore. '<em>Come on... Come on! I'm right here!</em>' Nothing came to her call. No familiar sound of the tuning fork, no itching of her skin, no rush of power...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Pain  flared to life as several magical energy daggers cut across her body  and forcing her to crash roughly into a building and fall. Catching  herself, she quickly descended, using the building she just hit as a  guide. Panting, she could tell her barrier Jacket was mostly ripped now  and could feel the wind blowing against her skin from a rather large  gap somewhere over her stomach area. '<em>Skeith... please...</em>' Again she felt a sudden hit on her stomach, making her breath leave her body. '<em>Fate...</em>' With the last thought, she slumped over.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Yuuno!”  Fate landed hard, falling over onto the ground and picking up the man's  upper body in her arms. “Yuuno! Come on, wake up! Say something!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Weakly his left eye opened, looking up at her hazily. “Fate... Hayate...inside... Nanoha escape... he's chasing her...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you okay!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man coughed, using his own energy to get to a sitting position. “Hayate... check on her...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  stayed with him a second longer to ensure herself he wouldn't topple  over as soon as she left his side. Rushing into the house he found the  girl laying on her stomach, spread out on the floor. “Hayate!” Sliding  down beside her, she shook her shoulder as gently as she could. “Open  your eyes!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ugh...” She came to quickly, waking much faster than  the male thanks to her years of battle. “Fate... We were jumped... Is  Yuuno okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He's okay,” Her red eyes glanced back over to him just to ensure herself as well. “And you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  time. The girls are safe, Nanoha took off, I don't know where, he's  after her, go.” Her words were broken, mind having trouble thinking  straight. “He hit my head... can't focus...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno spoke up from  across the room, grabbing their attention. “The jamming barrier's  gone... I can contact Shamal to get us and the forwards if they were  attacked as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They were,” Fate confirmed as she ran outside  and closed her eyes. “Get help immediately, I'm going to find Nanoha.”  She heard them reply but didn't listen. Instead she concentrated hard,  focusing on the bond she shared with her fiancée. '<em>Nanoha... Nanoha!</em>'  A feeling shot through her heart, making her leap into the air and fly  hard towards where she thought she would find her. She didn't have to  go far before finding a small section of the town encased in a short  barrier. Sailing down to it, she strangely enough found herself able to  pass into it without any trouble. '<em>It's a trap,</em>' she knew it but  right now didn't care. “Nanoha? Nanoha!?” Her voice seemed to fade into  nothing, only getting a laugh in return for her calls. Running fast,  she slid to a halt when she caught sight of a rather large looking man  in armor that she had seen before on both Balmung and Tri-Edge. “Who  are you!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My name is Orca. Orca of the Azure Sea. You are late, Fate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where is Nanoha!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She  has already been taken care of.” Reaching down behind an area Fate  couldn't see, he lifted up Nanoha's body by one of her wrist and held  her in the air so Fate could see.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blonde's world froze. She  couldn't move, couldn't take her eyes from the sight. Her friend,  lover, fiancée, was lifeless. Blood trickled down over one of her eyes  and barrier jacket torn to pieces. “Na...no...ha...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Didn't put up much of a fight, this one.” Orca continued to taunt her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My... My Nanoha...” Fate's words began to break, eyes brimming with tears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Crying? The Terror of Death? Pathetic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Give her to me.” Her words were suddenly cold, venom dripping in them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Orca chuckled as he wrapped his arm around Nanoha's waist and kept her in his arms. “What do you want with a body?” He pondered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Give her to me,” Fate repeated the words as she shoulders shook in fury, eyes glaring harshly at the ground. <em>“Give her to me!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  lose such a pretty figure?” He shifted her in his arms, looking at the  holes in the barrier jacket. “No, I think I'll keep her around for a  while longer.” Turning back to Fate, he grinned in satisfaction seeing  the small amount of blood drip from Fate's clenched fist where her  fingernails were biting into her skin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I swear,” Fate told him,  slowly looking up and meeting his eyes. Orca blinked in shock, seeing  the blond suddenly in front of him, hand thrusting up to his stomach  and into his skin. Red eyes bore into his as her fist ripping through  his body until it found his heart and crushed it between her fingers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  man almost dropped Fate, blinking again and this time seeing Fate where  she had been standing. His chest wasn't in pain, heart still beating. '<em>Illusion magic?</em>' He asked himself, shaking off the feeling. '<em>No... No it was desire...A desire to kill...</em>' The thought only made him smile more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I swear...” Fate repeated again as Bardiche formed in her hand. “Not even the flames of hell will protect you from me now.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Tia:  Our battle was won mostly by luck. Our opponent underestimated us  enough to allow us a win. I was proud at first, but then I heard of the  battle taknig place away from where we stood.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru: Fate is fighting like I've never seen before...Just watching makes me scared for my life...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate:  Devil Trigger, the small amount of insanity she inherited from Precia,  came again... Even if she wins this battle, I don't know if she herself  will survive in that state.</span></p>
