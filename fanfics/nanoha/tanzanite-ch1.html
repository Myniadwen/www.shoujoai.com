It was one of those mornings, the ones  where you just did not want to wake up. I was cold but at the same  time hot. My shirt, although loose, was sticking to my body and  becoming annoyingly tangled up. The sound of rain hitting the glass  windows made me dread the day even more. Shuffling on my bed made me  weakly open my eyes and see Nanoha sitting down while pulling up one  of her stockings. At first I looked at her blankly, trying to figure  out exactly why she was awake on such a horrible day. “Nanoha?”  My voice was alien, even to me. My best friend blinked lightly and  turned to gaze at me as I slowly sat up in bed while getting my  thoughts together. “Going to Morning training?” Crashing thunder  roared over head, making me stop just a moment in my speech. “Be  careful out there okay?”
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Tanzanite Night </strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By:</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan...” Nanoha looked at me  a moment before putting a finger on my nose. “You're sick aren't  you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I never knew how she could read me like  an open book, but it was times like this that really made me wonder  just how closely we were linked. I had purposely tried to make myself  look and speak fine but she wasn't fooled by it even for a moment.  “I'm... I'm not sick.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't lie to me.” I felt myself  being pushed back down onto the bed and the covers brought up to my  chin. “Now, be a good girl and stay in bed, you hear me?” Before  I could react Nanoha's forehead was on mine and I was looking up into  her clear blue eyes. “Because... Fate-chan's a good girl, right?”  I couldn't do anything but nod at her slightly. “Good.” She moved  away and instantly I found myself able to breathe again. “Raising  Heart, contact Fate's secretary please.” I gasped lightly, my plans  of sneaking to work apparently having been seen through. Nanoha  glared at me and I sank back even farther into the covers, pulling  the sheets up to my nose in an attempt to hide from that look. “Ah,  Yukon-san.” Nanoha greeted the young male on the screen. “Fate-chan  won't be coming into work today because of a cold so please forward  anything urgent to my device and I'll handle it okay?” She got a  salute and confirmation before the screen cut off silently. “Now,”  Turning to me she put a hand on her hip and bent over to touch my  nose again. “I want you to sleep. If you need anything contact me  okay?” Her finger stayed put as I meekly nodded up at her. When her  hand left she bent over the rest of the way and moved my hair away  from my forehead before placing a small kiss onto it. “Sweet  dreams, Fate-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was already falling asleep again by  the time I heard the door to our apartment close. The sheets were  warm and the blanket on top of them kept me comfortable despite the  chill in the air. Somehow I had made my way over to what was  generally known as 'Nanoha's side of the bed' during my tossing and  turning and latched myself onto her pillows. They were soft and  fluffy, filled with feathers instead of my preferred ones stuffed  with cotton. Despite this I still felt an odd sense of comfort in  them, even if they weren't my preference. It was strange but the  pillows smelled like Nanoha to me. Even though we both  used the same  washing detergent, slept in the same bed, and generally lived  together... Her pillows were different. Pulling one closer to myself  I hugged it and buried my face into the soft folds of fabric. A long  inhale through my nose made my body stop wanting to move so much and  calmed me down to the point of finally succumbing to my brain's  desire for rest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When I awoke again it was to the sound  of scuffling downstairs. It was still raining, cutting off any  attempt to see what time it was by the sunlight in the room so I  looked weakly at the clock above our nightstand. Half past noon  already it seemed. Nanoha should be on lunch break now so why was she  downstairs? She never came home for lunch since it was so far out of  her way. “Fate-chan, stay in bed!” She called up to me just as  soon as I moved the covers away from my body. “I'll bring you some  food so just wait a moment!” I tilted my head to the side and  blinked but still did as she requested. How she knew I was awake, let  alone about to get out of bed, amazed me. True, over the time we've  been together we have on more than one occasion finished each other's  sentences, spoke each other's mind before the other could actually  say it themselves, and even know what the other was feeling no matter  how far apart we were. Closing my eyes I brought a hand to my chest  and held it over my heart. We shared a type of synergy that couldn't  be described and using it, I sent a heart-felt thanks towards her. If  it reached or not was answered shortly when Nanoha walked up the  stairs holding a try with a bowl on it and gave me the best smile  I've seen in a long, long time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I accepted the tray from her but  apparently it wasn't enough for my friend to simply cook for me.  Instead I found the spoon taken by her hands and a nice helping of  what appeared to be home made chicken noodle soup lifted up. Bringing  it to her lips, Nanoha blew on it softly before guiding it to my  mouth. I took the bite at once and closed my eyes as the taste  lingered. Nanoha wasn't really a good cook, but for some reason this  soup tasted really good to me. Looking back at her, I smiled to  release the tension she had to see if I liked it or not and was  rewarded with another bite. If it had been anyone else I wouldn't  have allowed such babying but Nanoha was special. She knew in her  heart that I craved attention despite my best efforts at hiding the  truth. I didn't need to be the center of conversation, nor to be  idealized or admired. What I needed was what Nanoha gave to me: love.  To be pampered every now and then, to be smiled at and told 'good  job', to simply be taken care of. That was all I needed, and Nanoha  was the only one who knew it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When the feeding was done I was treated  to a slow back massage that soon scaled to even my arms and waist.  Slowly hands were rubbed over my back under my sleep shirt and around  my body. Warm fingers pressed just hard enough for me to feel, gentle  kneading of my muscles soothed me to the point of dreaming while  still barely awake. I don't know exactly how long the heavenly  treatment lasted but I did know that Nanoha surely had to be late for  whatever appointment she had to keep after her lunch time was over.  The hands slowly retreated and fixed my shirt back properly before I  once again felt the hair on my head be shifted slightly. “Sleep  well,” Nanoha whispered gently to me before placing a lingering  soft kiss on my temple. I was too tired to respond verbally but when  her hand passed over mine on her way back I did manage to give it  just a light squeeze. Her fingertips trailed slowly over my hand and  I felt a sudden sense of happiness wash over my body. She was  reluctant to leave, and that made me smile fondly as I drifted off to  sleep.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Waking up again later on I slowly  brought myself to a sitting position. The rain hadn't let up yet  despite being later in the afternoon. Ignoring this, I crawled out of  bed and looked around the loft apartment lazily. All the lights were  off except the small one in the kitchen that I could see faintly  glowing downstairs and around the corner. After rubbing my eyes I  walked down the stairs and clicked on the main lights. All at once  the room was flooded with a brightness that made me shield my eyes as  I rubbed my temples. The constant drone of rain on glass was normally  welcome to me but today I just wasn't in the mood. As I passed our  radio controls I turned it on and set the volume to be loud enough to  cover the rain slightly but still soft enough to not give me a  headache. After making it to the kitchen I cut on the lights in that  room as well and promptly swallowed two pills to help battle my  draining sinuses and suppress the cough that was still plaguing me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha had done a good job of cleaning  up as she cooked today, leaving only a few things out on the counter  for me to mess with. Normally the girl was just a little bit on the  messy side, leaving her plates and glasses on the kitchen counter to  be put away another time. Although I could tell she tried her best to  clean as she went it was still something I found rather cute about  her. In front of everyone else she was almost picture perfect, always  on top of things and had everyone in a straight line under her  command. At home, however, where only I could see her...She was still  a little childish, messy, and even down right clumsy at times. The  thought made me smile as I started cleaning up the kitchen, even  taking out the spray bottle of cleaner and getting some paper towels.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I never really thought about it before  now but Nanoha did act differently around me. I bet everyone would be  surprised to know that she slept with a stuffed animal, even more so  that she loved bubble baths and sweet things. Speaking of sweet  things I noticed that the plate of brownies we baked together two  days ago was already down to three pieces left. I had only eaten two  that I could think of, leaving the other eighty-percent or so to  Nanoha's sweet tooth. I guess growing up in a coffee/cake shop would  do that to you. With a smile I picked a square and bit into it. Come  to think of it, Nanoha liked nuts in her brownies whereas I liked  extra fudge. On this batch we had compromised, putting in both. The  results were a weird gooey brownie that still had a crunch to them  thanks to the small bits that Nanoha loved so much. Although I think  she got her way more so than I did, the happy look on her face when  she was enjoying a sugary treat made me smile to myself. The picture  perfect Ace of Aces was no more than a teenage girl with an addiction  to chocolate... And only I knew it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">By the time my thoughts and slowly  eaten brownie were gone I realized that I had already cleaned the  entire kitchen. Moving on, I made my way into the living room and  started fixing the scattered magazines on the table. Although this  mess was more of mine than hers I still noticed little things that  made me giggle. Small candy wrappers that she had forgotten about and  two glasses that I assume were from her dinner last night and  whatever she had drank this afternoon in her hurry to get back to  work after taking care of me. Next to the small mess I noticed one of  our picture albums still out. Curiously I sat down on the couch and  picked it up to flip through it. My mood rose quickly when I realized  that this one was Nanoha's own personal album that I had only seen  once before after an hour long pleading session. Inside were pictures  of the two of us ever since we met. Taken from still shots from the  T.S.A.B's videos, Nanoha had photos of both the time I had tried to  hurt her to even that day on the bridge where we had swapped ribbons.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I felt a little guilty flipping through  the book and had to make myself stop after a few pages. Nanoha was  shy about that album and I already felt horrible at seeing what I  did, even if it was mainly by accident. Placing it back down, I took  the small handful of trash to the kitchen's garbage can and sat the  two glasses in the sink. By now all the walking around had taken it's  toll on me and I was starting to feel a little woozy. The lights in  the kitchen were clicked off as I left and the living room main  lights followed shortly after. I didn't think I would make it to the  bedroom without getting worse so I simply chose rather to lay on the  couch and pull the blanket off the back of it over me. Curling up  against the back rest and burying my head into a pillow, I closed my  eyes and took a deep happy breath. The sound of rain was just barely  heard over the distant sounds of the radio and I couldn't help but  worry a little about Nanoha being outside in that weather. Although I  knew she had her umbrella, as it wasn't next to the door, I still  hoped she remembered to dress warmly. I couldn't remember if she got  her coat or not and I was too weak right now to go check the closet.  Oh well, I'm pretty sure if she was uncomfortable I would be able to  feel it, and right now my heart was calm so I pushed the thought from  my mind. Nanoha was a big girl after all, even if I did so enjoy  thinking otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My third awakening came with a bit of a  surprise. I was in bed again for some reason, curled up on Nanoha's  side once again. At first I thought I had sleep walked to my current  location but after looking at the nightstand the truth became  apparent. A medium sized stuffed bunny was looking at me along with a  card in it's lap and a single red rose in a vase next to it. Reaching  for it, I plucked the card first and read it with a soft smile. '<em>To  Fate, get better soon. Love, Nanoha</em>'  I couldn't help but laugh. She was horrible at writing on cards but  it was the simple childlike attitude that I loved so much about her.  The rose was sniffed after I sat up in bed but I only took the bunny  with me downstairs in search of my other half. I found her in the  kitchen again, messing up the area I just cleaned in typical Nanoha  fashion. “Hey,” I greeted lightly, pleased that my voice was no  longer as scratchy as it was before. When she turned to look at me I  held up the stuffed rabbit and used my finger to make it wave one of  it's little hands to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan,”  She replied with a large smile and slight hop over to me. “How are  you feeling?” After a tight hug she went back over to what she was  cooking to make sure it wouldn't burn. “I hope you got enough rest  today?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I nodded slightly  and hopped up to sit on the counter, despite my constant nagging to  her not to do the same thing. “I feel a lot better, thank you.”  Placing the rabbit in my lap, I watched her cook. “Thank you for  the gifts, they made me cheer up a whole lot.” It was true, and I  would probably cherish this silly rabbit for years to come. Gifts  from Nanoha were common since she couldn't really express herself  well with words. Instead, whenever she felt like she needed to say  something that wasn't related to work, she would always give me some  sort of small item to help convey her feelings. The sad thing was I  still had all of them hidden away in a box in our closet. I don't  know if she knew or not but even the first flower she gave me was  pressed in my favorite book.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm happy,”  Nanoha's words snapped me out of my thoughts and turned my attention  back onto her. “Are you hungry?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Starved,” I  looked over at what was in the pot she was working with and noticed a  thick red sauce. Paired with it was a larger pot of boiling water  which I assumed had pasta in it. “Spaghetti?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,” She  confirmed with a hum. “I have garlic rolls in the oven too. I was  debating for a while on what I should cook since you wasn't feeling  well so I figured something simple would probably be best.” After  checking the rolls in the oven she smiled at me. “Plus, I know you  will take any reason to eat garlic bread.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey now,” I  teased her back with a small giggle. It was true; garlic was my  favorite thing to eat, be it on pasta, bread, chicken, pork...  anything really. At lunch I normally had a salad on the go with a  piece of garlic bread. This lead to quite an embarrassing situation  where Nanoha told me my breath was really strong one day and I  realized that I had probably been talking to my office-mates with bad  breath for a long time. Needless to say I always kept a pack of gum  in my purse now. “Anyway,” I got back on topic even though Nanoha  couldn't read my thoughts. “How was your day?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmmm...” She  thought the question over a moment before answering. “Okay I  suppose.” Pausing to check a noodle, she slurped it up and chewed a  moment before declaring them done. “Really stunk training out in  the harsh weather so after the first training session I instead opted  to taking them to the gym across campus. A little work out never hurt  anyone.” Moving to drain the noodles she hummed to herself while  working. She was always humming it seemed, a cute little quirk she  had picked up from me over the time we've spent together. It wasn't  long then until I found myself sitting down at the table talking  about nothing in particular as we ate. The food wasn't the best but  once again it still seemed extra special to me today and I enjoyed it  immensely. I had extra bread and I took full advantage of it to help  settle my stomach. Nanoha was holding back a grin as I ate but I was  used to it by now. Whenever she cooked she always smiled at me while  eating it seemed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm stuffed,”  I sighed out happily and leaned back in my chair. “That was very  good, thank you.” Closing my eyes I took a long intake through my  nose.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No need to thank  me silly girl.” Nanoha pointed out as she started taking the dishes  to the kitchen for me. “I'm just glad it was edible, I'm not really  the best at cooking meals.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you're  awesome at cooking desserts,” I reminded her with a smile as she  stood behind my chair and leaned over to look at me. “Hi there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello,” She  cooed while moving a strand of hair away from my neck in a casual  flirt. It was things like this that made everyone think we were  dating but I didn't care in the least. Reaching up, I took both her  hands in mine and smiled up at her with a light blush. “You're face  is red,” She informed me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That's your  fault,” I replied simply. The news made her simply grin and lean  closer to wrap me in a loose hug around my neck. “Mmmm, thanks, I  needed that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you feeling  better now that you ate?” She pulled away just enough to look down  into my eyes again. “Can I do anything for you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let's watch a  movie?” The question surprised me just as much as it did her.  Lately we never seemed to simply sit down together and watch T.V.  Normally we were too busy with work or were just not home enough  together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm, okay.”  Nanoha kissed my forehead before moving away and helping me to my  feet. “Find something good while I go change into something more  comfortable?” She walked backwards while holding my hands, waiting  for my reply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,” I gave  her palms a slight squeeze and she trotted off to the stairs and up  to our bedroom. Moving to the couch I sat down and looked around  briefly for the remote. Turning my attention to the T.V. I clicked it  on and was greeted by the main menu of the entertainment monitor.  Using the remote I clicked the selection over to movies and started  browsing through the selection of new releases. Finally a romantic  comedy came up that perked my interest and after reading the summery  I chose it. I knew Nanoha preferred action flicks but since I was the  sick girl I didn't feel as bad making her sit through a romance with  me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Back,” Nanoha  stated the obvious as she sat down next to me in a pink tank top with  matching lacy panties. It was the closest thing to a teddy that she  would wear, unlike me who preferred silky things to rest in. “What  movie are we watching?” The large blanket on the couch was tossed  over both of us, robbing me of my view. “You didn't pick some sappy  love story did you?” She knew me so well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I did,” I  confirmed her fears and pointed to the screen with a small motion of  my head. As she looked I made myself comfortable by snuggling up next  to her on the recliner section of the couch and leaned it back, also  bringing up the footrest. The two of us wiggled a bit to get  comfortable and I found myself under her arm, cuddled up against her  body with my head resting against her neck. This position was the  opposite of what we normally did and I felt a little happy to be  embraced like this for a change. No wonder Nanoha liked this position  so much.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The movie was  pretty good in my opinion. A little cheesy but good none the less.  The jokes were enough to make me giggle and even Nanoha seemed to be  amused at times. Although about half way through the showing I  couldn't help but feel a little guilty. Nanoha was semi enjoying  herself but I could tell that it was mainly for me. With a smile I  moved a little closer to her and was rewarded with a gentle squeezing  of my shoulder. The mood was right, the lights were all off and the  only illumination was coming from the screen. Deciding to tease my  friend I turned more onto my side instead of my back and placed one  hand onto her stomach. Nanoha stiffened slightly at the contact but  quickly relaxed again. With a small grin I trailed one finger along  the cotton fabric of her tank top until I reached the bottom of it  and slowly hooked my fingertip under the hem. Bringing it up, I  lifted Nanoha's shirt up enough to uncover her tummy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I could tell she  was wondering what I was doing but I was already in a playful  romantic mood so I didn't mind. We were both covered by the blanket  and my head was under hers so I didn't feel too embarrassed. Ever so  gently I placed my fingertip against her skin and trailed it along  her tone stomach. Nanoha went stiff again and I was amused by the  sudden shivering under my touch. Moving to her bellybutton I trailed  my fingertip around it in a circle a moment before slowly moving  across it. My friend shivered openly but made no move to stop my  teasing. Encouraged, I pressed my palm flat against her  and rubbed  softly while watching the movie. Occasionally, whenever I thought she  was getting used to my hand being on her, I would trail it up to her  breasts and use one finger to playfully trace the line right under  them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The movie was  coming to a close so I decided to finish my playing before the mood  was broken. Already I could tell that my teasing had an effect of my  friend and I was proud to know that I could cause such a reaction.  Lightly I resumed my fingertip trailing across her stomach but this  time I let it trail a little lower and traced the lines of her hips  to the soft fabric of her panties. By now Nanoha's breath was getting  a little erratic so I shifted just enough to plant a small kiss onto  her neck. The motion didn't calm her down in the least but I was held  tighter none the less. My fingertip slipped under her hem and I  lifted up slightly, moving my finger along the entire front side  before slowly sliding the tip of my hand underneath. She gasped  lightly this time, making me giggle. I amused myself by teasing the  small patch of hair for the remainder of the final scene and slowly  withdrew my hand when the credits started. With a small pat on her  panties, I moved my hand up to fix her shirt and curled up against  her fully, closing my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That's mean,”  She finally whispered to me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm,” I agreed  happily, rubbing her side with my thumb.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The screen cut off  due to Nanoha's command with the remote and I found her embracing me  fully. “Playful for someone who's sick?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I feel better.”  I told her honestly. “You took good care of me.” It was then that  I noticed the mood was still lingering around us. “Hey, Nanoha?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, Fate-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Remember when we  were seventeen? We went to Prom together?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because we  didn't have dates? Yes, that was really fun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you took me  home.” I moved slightly, using my nose to guide myself up in the  dark until I found her face. “And we were standing at my doorstep?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The first time  we kissed mouth to mouth,” She finished for me. “It was then  everyone thought we were dating.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm.” My hand  went up to caresses her cheek. “And we just kept getting closer...”  Instead of an answer I found her lips against mine in a slow sensual  kiss. My heart sped up slightly as I pushed myself closer to her and  returned it. When we broke it was only to get another small intake of  air and touch again. I could feel her lipstick pressing against me  and after a second break, felt her tongue gently request entrance. It  was our first deep kiss, and it was amazing. The simple act of  touching our tongues together made me sweat. I felt her trace my  lips, making me open my mouth up more for her. She was teasing me,  revenge for what I had done during the movie. I allowed her to do so  for a few minutes before I finally gave in to my desire and instead  attacked her mouth, pressing past her lips and tasting her. It was  still slow, painstakingly so, but I didn't want it any other way.  Gentle touches, slight moans, and tight embraces. It was forever  before we broke and when we did we were both out of breath, panting  slowly against each other's wet lips. “Nanoha...” I was shaking  slightly and hugged her close. “Carry me to bed?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” Although  she was shaking as well she still managed to lift me like a princess  after removing the blanket. I could tell we both wanted to continue  but the sudden rush had started making me feel a little faint, and  the last thing I wanted to do was get sick on her while making out.  “Ne, Fate-chan?” She asked me as I was gently laid in bed. I  opened my eyes and looked up at her as she crawled over me and got  under the covers as well. “We'll always be together, won't we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Always,” I  agreed with her, arm reaching out and cuddling my best friend.  “Always and forever.” I felt her kiss my forehead again and her  hand started rubbing my back soothingly. We had become even closer  tonight, and I was happier than I had been in a long time. Even if I  was feeling a little bad, it was storming like crazy, and our first  deep kiss tasted strangely like garlic bread. “Oh, and Nanoha?”  She hummed slightly to me to show she was listening. “You need to  shave, you're like a porcupine.” The room went silent for just a  moment before my friend collapsed in a small fit of giggles, pulling  me closer to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love you, you  silly girl.”</span></p>
