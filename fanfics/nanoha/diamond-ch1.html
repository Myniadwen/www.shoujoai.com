<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was a simple mission  to say the least, something that I could have easily done by myself  in a little under five minutes if I so desired to. Right now,  however, I was training Subaru, my favorite student. I let her lead  and followed her commands precisely, only stopping to give my own  thoughts when I was unsure if her plan would work or not. I was  really proud right now; we had managed to get into the research lab  with only minor resistance and no alert had been signaled just yet.  My pupil contacted me telepathically, telling me what she was about  to do and asked for assistance. With a cheerful nod, I smiled at her,  grabbing her shorts and yanking her back down when she tried to leap  into action. She gave me an inquisitive look and I simply pointed  upwards where a security camera was slowly scanning the room. Subaru  looked dumbstruck a moment before hanging her head. I was going to  knock at least five points off her score for that little mistake and  she knew it.</span></p>
</span>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Diamond  Dust</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By: </strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally reaching the  door leading into the main laboratory where the target lost logia  was, we pressed ourselves against both sides of the door and nodded  to each other. I let her go in first and she quickly knocked out both  guards by the door, startling the lone scientist in the room. “Dr.  Alex Wily,” She stated his name firmly. “Despite several warning  and request for you to turn over your research to the Time-Space  Administration Bureau, you have continued without a reply. I am here  to place you under arrest, please surrender quietly; if you do you  will be given a fair trial.” She watched the man walk behind a  counter as she talked, eying him carefully. The man’s lips went up  into a faint smile, making Subaru blink. Before she could react  several chains shot out of hidden chambers around the girl. Most were  dodged but when one managed to lodge itself into her rollerblades and  she quickly tripped up and fell over.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You talk too much,”  Nanoha sighed, easily breaking the bonds around her. “Next time  just get to the point.” She helped the girl to her feet after  blasting away the remaining binding chains with a wave of her hand.  “Like this,” She faced the man. “Put your hands up and come  here or we’ll use force!” The scientist pulled out a gun and  aimed it, firing several shots and sending small beams of light  towards the girls. “Down!” Nanoha tackled Subaru and pushed her  onto the floor, covering her student as best she could. “Laser  beams! Why do they always have laser beams!?” The two put their  backs against the counter they were hiding behind and Nanoha threw a  small temper tantrum. “So help me if I have to use that burn cream  after getting shot I’m failing you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah! Don’t do  that!” Subaru pleaded apologetically. “I didn’t know he’d  have traps and advanced weaponry!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Always plan for the  worst!” Nanoha cried out, holding up Raging Heart in her standard  staff form. “I’m giving you one cartridge to finish this,” The  woman slid a shell from her pack and handed it to Subaru. “These  pack a more serious punch than the ones you’re used to so be  careful with it and plan out what you’re going to do before you do  it okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes Ma’am!”  Subaru took the offered shell and slid it into her power glove. ‘<em>One  shot…</em>’ Her mind raced, looking around the counter at the  panicking man who was moving his gun back and forth to different  parts of the room. ‘<em>He’s nervous,</em>’ She noted with a smug  look. ‘<em>That means he’ll jump to anything… In that case,</em>’  The girl looked at Nanoha and nodded to show that her plan had been  formed. Quickly she grabbed a glass beaker from the table and threw  it across the room. When the container shattered the man instantly  started shooting frantically over in that direction. “Load  cartridge!”  The girl felt the world around her shatter into slow  motion as her Wing Road blasted around the room, taking her with it.  ‘<em>such power!</em>’ Her mind screamed, feeling her glove start  to burn her hand from the magic it still hadn’t used. “Divine…  Buster!” She punched the area in front of her, now to the side of  the man in white lab coat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The destruction was  catastrophic, taking out at least half of the science lab and sending  everyone else stationed there in a blind panic to escape the now  burning building. The man they were after was stunned on the floor,  the lost logia revealed from his torn and burnt coat. “I’ll take  that,” She glared, reaching down and picking it up, showing it into  a special pouch. “Mission complete!” She turned to Nanoha and  gave a peace sign. “How was that, teacher?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Watch out!” Nanoha  leapt forward onto a counter before using her magic to speed herself  up. Subaru turned to look at why her instructor had just freaked out  and saw the man she thought was down for the count throwing a small  glass vial at her. Instinct took over and her fist flew. “No, don’t  break it!” Nanoha cried too late, seeing glass flew and glittering  dust splatter into the air. With no other choice she tackled her  friend, feeling her arm get clipped by a laser as she did so.  Breathing in a grunt of pain, she felt a strange tingling sensation  on the back of her neck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two landed roughly  and the more experienced mage finally look the matters into her own  hands, shooting a simple blast over at the man, knocking him into a  counter. “First rule!” She yelled, walking over to him and  cracking the man upside the head with Raging Heart. “Never think  they are down for the count.” She lifted her staff again when he  reached into his pocket and batted away the man’s wrist forcefully,  knocking away some other type of device. “Even when they <em>are</em> down, don’t think they won’t have something hidden. Second Rule,”  Nanoha turned around to face her, once more clipping the man across  the head with her staff, although this time by accident “Never  cause unwanted attention or destruction!” She threw her arms out,  jabbing the man in the chest with the staff’s tip, knocking him  back over when he barely managed to stand without even realizing it.  “Third Rule, never let your guard down at any time until you are  back at base!” Nanoha stomped her foot, crushing the man’s hand  while he tried to crawl away desperately.  “And Fourth rule…!”  Nanoha thrust her staff downwards, pinning the man harshly. “…When  I think of a fourth rule I’ll tell you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please! No more!”  The man begged pathetically, trying to crawl towards Subaru. “I  give up! I give up! Just don’t let her hurt me anymore!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha blinked and  looked down. “…What happened to him?” She asked innocently.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha crossed her  arms, clearly upset at the way things turned out. They were currently  in a helicopter flying back to the rendezvous point with their  prisoner locked safely in the holding cell. Her arm was stinging  horribly and she knew there would be a blister there that she would  eventually have to have Shamal cut to release the pressure from any  internal bleeding. The thought made her cringe in her seat, making  Subaru glance nervously over at her. The instructor noticed the  scared look and put on a smile for her. “Don’t worry Subaru, you  didn’t fail.” Her anger slowly died away as she talked. “I was  a little disappointed in how you acted, but overall you did really  well. Once you learn how to calm down a little you’ll be doing  great.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,” She looked  down in her lap. “My first mission too…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry, don’t  worry.” Nanoha patted the girl’s head. “Next time will be  better.” A small monitor appeared between them next, making Nanoha  lean back a little. “Ah, Fate-chan! How did it go?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perfectly!” She  greeted her friend, obviously pleased. “Elio and Rushie were  amazing! Nanoha-chan, I’m really proud of them!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ohhh?” She smiled  at her friend. “Can I talk to them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re both  passed out asleep,” Fate turned and led the monitor over to the  seats behind her where Elio was laid back with Rushie apparently  cuddled up under his arm with one hand gripping the front of his  shirt. “You should have seen it, Rushie was going to get hit by an  attack and Elio jumped in front of her with his shield. It was the  sweetest thing ever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Awww, how cute!”  Nanoha cried out. “Did you take their picture?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A few of them,”  Fate replied quietly before going back to her seat and sitting in it.  “How did Subaru do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Great. We had a  little trouble at the end, but it all worked out well.” Nanoha  rubbed her arm, making Fate narrow her eyes. “I’m fine really.”  When Fate didn’t say anything Nanoha sighed and rolled her sleeve  back to reveal a long dark red mark on her skin. “I got clipped by  a laser.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ouch!” Fate made a  face. “Make sure Shamal looks at it when you get back okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes.” Nanoha  pulled her sleeve back down and playfully saluted her friend. “We’re  approaching base now so I’ll see you later, Fate-chan.” Her blond  friend smiled at her before the monitor blipped out of existence.  Nanoha looked over at Subaru’s concerned expression and gave her  another smile. “I’m fine, don’t worry. It takes more than this  to get me down,” Her smile faulted lightly when she suddenly  coughed a few times. “Ack, I inhaled wrong.” The words made her  student finally crack a smile.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Hello, Nanoha-chan,”  Shamal greeted the girl happily when she walked into the medical room  of the base. “What brings you here today? Need some bandages for  your students?” She giggled happily. “You didn’t go too rough  on them again did you?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, no, they’re  fine.” Nanoha smiled uneasily, holding her arm and looking away  lightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With a sigh, Shamal put  a hand on her hip. “Come on, let me see.” She patted a bed and  pulled a curtain around them when Nanoha walked past. “What  happened?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I got hit by a high  tech laser-type devise,” Nanoha admitted, unbuttoning her jacket  and very slowly slipping her arm out with the light blonde’s help.  Once done she took a small moment to observe that her long sleeve  undershirt had a rather nasty looking bloodstain on it. “It’s no  where near as bad as that makes it look,” She told her friend  instantly, undoing the buttons on that shirt as well and slipping  only that arm from the sleeve.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh my,” Shamal  looked worried. “That’s quite a nasty burn you have there.”  Quickly she gathered a few things and began to clean the wound. “Did  it get you deep?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just a glance, I can  still move my fingers just fine. It only really <em>hurts</em> when I  make a fist.”  The girl turned her head and coughed a few times.  “Excuse me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On a scale of one to  ten, how bad does it hurt?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Four maybe?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So that’s about a  seven on anyone else’s scale,” She mused, making Nanoha wonder if  she was being complimented or teased. “I hate to say it but it’s  going to leave a rather large blister that might have a faint scar  depending on how you let it heal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Scars were nothing new  to the girl, as she had several racking her body. Fortunately each  one was so small that they would be missed by most anyone unless she  was being closely observed. “I’d rather avoid that if possible.  Can you just heal it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Healing doesn’t  really work well on burns,” She told her, repeating the same thing  she always said when Nanoha came in with an injury like this. “We’ll  have to apply a cream on it and wrap it in a bandage. I’d prefer it  if you wore a sling to keep you from flexing that muscle… you’re  left handed too aren’t you? Poor thing,” Shamal pet Nanoha’s  head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t want to  wear a sling!” She protested instantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re going to  wear a sling,” Shamal confirmed, getting the burn cream and some  magically infused healing bandages.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t wanna!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re going to  wear a sling,” She repeated happily, always amused at how quickly  Nanoha would act like a child when it came to keeping her in top  shape.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-chan, I’m  authorized to magically seal your powers until this heals you know.”  She smiled gently at the girl, who instantly sank back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Yes ma’am…”  Her eyes widened slightly as a coughing fit racked her body, making  her double over and cover her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you okay?”  Shamal quickly got a glass of water and offered it to the girl, who  drank it quickly, making a face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My throat hurts…”  she rubbed it ruefully, wincing. “I think I got some glass in it  when I inhaled…” Suddenly she found Shamal in front of her with a  tongue depressor. Obediently opening her mouth, she stuck out her  tongue and allowed her mouth to be inspected with a pen light. Her  mind flashed back to when she tackled Subaru and felt the glittering  substance coat her throat and mouth when the vial had been broken.  When she was free to speak again, she opened her mouth to speak.  “Actually…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Just then the door  opened and someone shouted out for help, making Shamal quickly leave  the girl after telling her to stay put. Nanoha looked out the curtain  and winced at seeing the man draped over the shoulder of his friend,  bleeding. Time went by slowly and when someone came to check up on  her she found that her friend was busy in emergency surgery so she  allowed the nurse to apply the medicine on her arm and wrap it up. A  spare shirt was given to her and she allowed the nurse to help put it  on before her arm was confounded to the sling.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate opened the door to  her loft apartment and immediately loosened her collar. “Nanoha-chan,  I’m home!” Her voice rang out through the rooms but she got no  reply. “ Nanoha-chaaaaaan?” Fate turned off the Monitor in the  living room that doubled as their T.V. Now with the noise gone she  heard the faint sound of running water. The girl climbed the stairs  to their bedroom and took off her jacket, hanging it up next to the  bed, before going to the bathroom and opening the door.  “Nanoha-chan?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kya, Fate-chan’s a  pervert!” Nanoha accused instantly, turning so her back was facing  her friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t give me  that,” Fate crossed her arms. “Who was it that begged me to wash  her back last night?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, I did, didn’t  I?” Nanoha thought aloud, pretending to think about it. “In that  case I’ll forgive you for being a perv.” She turned around to  look at her, revealing her arm. “Actually…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh my, why is it in  a sling?” Fate quickly walked over to her and Nanoha stepped out of  the spray of water so her friend wouldn’t get wet. “Are you  okay?” She observed the bandages, watching the water roll off of  them like it wasn’t even getting wet at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m okay, it  doesn’t really hurt that bad. Only down side is I can’t use my  arm until it heals or it’ll heal wrong and scar, or something like  that. Shamal seemed to think so at least. It’s my left arm so I’m  kind of in a pickle, I can’t even wash my hair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll do it for  you, just wait a little bit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? Thank you,  Fate-chan!” She moved to hug the girl but stopped herself just in  time. “Oh, um, I’ll hug you when you’re naked.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That sounds <em>so</em> wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha smiled at her.  “It’s okay, I don’t mind.” She watched her friend’s cheeks  turn lightly before she herself moved to leave the bathroom and get a  change of cloths, pausing at the door to offer her one more glance at  her embarrassed but happy face.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha blushed darkly,  sitting on her bed completely naked with a large fluffy towel being  rubbed though her hair. She had to admit that it felt rather nice,  but her face was still dark- and not from the hot water she was just  in either. Once her hair was reasonably damp instead of sopping wet,  Fate moved down to her shoulders. Gently rubbing the towel over them,  Fate smiled at the small moans coming from her friend. “Like that?”  She asked softly, getting an embarrassed nod. She moved behind her  friend and sat on her knees, slowly drying her off. The towel rubbed  her back gently, pressing down enough to absorb the water as well as  a pleasant rub as well. “Arms,” She asked, getting Nanoha to  raise her good arm instantly to be dried and then her injured one  followed much more carefully. Once complete, Fate moved over to her  friend’s other side, putting the towel against her front and  rubbing.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah-ahnn,” Nanoha  gasped out involuntarily when her breast were dried, making her  friend instantly flush and apologize. “Nuh-uh, it’s okay…”  She looked away softly, pressing her chest forward against Fate’s  hands through the towel. Her friend didn’t reply, instead running  the towel over her body again. Nanoha gently moaned out, trying her  best to keep from embarrassing herself even more. All too soon it was  over and Fate moved down to her waist and legs, keeping all the  important parts covered to spare herself a nose bleed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There, dry.” Fate  went away quickly, moving to dry herself off properly as well. ‘<em>What  was Hayate-chan thinking, giving us a room like this?</em>’ She  looked over at her friend, who was taking her night shirt off of a  coat hanger clumsily. ‘<em>As if seeing her naked in a public bath  house wasn’t bad enough…</em>’ Despite her thoughts, she also  had to admit that she was very happy at the same time. “Here, let  me help.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” Nanoha  allowed herself to be clothed by the knee length shirt and watched  Fate slowly button it up, looking away slightly when she got to the  lower clasp. “Nyahaha,” The giggle made Fate look at her in  question but only got a cute look in return. Her sling was put in  after sliding up a simple pair of panties while Fate used the time to  dress herself as well, choosing rather to wear a dress from her  childhood that had been retailored to fit her more mature body. It  was a simple black dress with exposed shoulders and long baggy  sleeves, complete with tie strings at the end incase she need them  out of her way. When left loose, like it normally was, the sleeves  almost engulfed her hands, giving her a rather cute look. Once Nanoha  had even bought her a cat ear headband and had insisted that she wear  it anytime she wore that particular dress. The habit lasted the good  part of three months before the headband was lost during a midnight  scramble to battle. At first she was happy to be rid of the cosplay  accessory, since Nanoha always made sure she wore it even around  their other friends, but soon after it was lost did she really start  to miss it. Her hand went to run through her hair a moment,  remembering the happy smile Nanoha always had when she would look at  her while wearing it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan lost in  thought?” Nanoha’s words snapped her out of her trance. “Hehe,  what was you thinking about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing really.”  Fate walked over to her. “What do you want to do?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,” the brown  haired girl sat on the bed, summoning up a few monitor screens in  front of her. “Tia took her test yesterday and Subaru was graded by  me personally so I already know her grade. I need to know about Elio  and Rushie particularly if you don’t mind telling me?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,” Fate sat  next to her and typed a few things up. “Here is the information on  their devices.”  She watched Nanoha attempt to try and type  something but stopped when she remembered her left hand wasn’t  useable currently. “Here, let me.” The girl crawled behind her on  the bed and sat down, moving her legs on either side of Nanoha’s  body and pressing her front against the other girl’s back. “What  do you want to see?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Chart displays on  power synced to video, please.” She saw Fate’s arms reach around  her and type the commands, bringing it up. “Also give me a time  frame on upper left corner?” The hands dances a little more, making  it pop up. “Hey, I could get used to this,” She snuggled up  against Fate, leaning back and resting her head against her shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, are you going  to cuddle or work?” Fate teased, but still allowed one arm to wrap  around her waist to hold her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Both,” She replied  easily with a smile. “Play video, please.” She covered her mouth  to cough a moment before looking up to watch.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha awoke abruptly,  eyes snapping open in the dark. A sudden fear seized her body as her  dream of drowning faded, replaced by something much more real. She  could feel her body was covered in a cold sweat and her chest was  alive with a fire that she had never experienced before. Her mind  screamed for her to take a breath, that she wasn’t really in the  water, but for some reason her lungs wouldn’t listen. Seconds  ticked by painstakingly slow as she tried harder to get air into her  system. Finally she managed to roll over on her back and found that  the motion made it a little easier but still her mouth couldn’t  seem to suck in any oxygen.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slate blue eyes darted  across the room in fear, her breath barely moving at all. Her eyes  closed tightly then as she forced herself to try and think straight.  ‘<em>Breathe! Breathe! BREATHE!</em>’ the mental command worked,  allowing herself to take in half a ragged gasp of air, but quickly  lost most of it when her throat shot pain throughout her body. The  girl coughed slightly, but it was enough to fleck her lips with  blood. Blinded by her fear, Nanoha moved her hands, grasping the  sheets of the bed and pushing with her feet, as if it would allow her  to once again taste air. The silence of the room was broken softly by  a low mumble beside her. ‘<em>Fate! FATE!</em>’ Her hand moved  spastically, cursing the large bed they shared as she tried to find  her friend. Frozen in place, she tried again, reaching out  desperately to find her while her other hand was tearing at her  shirt, trying to find some way, anyway, to allow herself to breathe.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her hand touched the  soft silk of Fate’s nightgown and she gripped it tightly,  desperately pulling. “Mnnn…” Fate muttered something under her  breath and tried to scoot away from her to give her friend more room.  Again she tried to find her, hand inching closer as another cough  stole more of the precious little air she managed to suck in. She  could feel a mixture of her own blood and salvia run down her cheek  as she silently suffocated, frantically reaching over. Finally she  felt Fate’s arm and she gripped it, pulling with everything she had  left, burying her nails into her friend’s skin in a frightened  attempt to wake her up. “Nanoha-chan, that hurts…” Fate  whispered, trying to move her hand lightly. When she realized how  hard she was being gripped her body rolled over, half focusing on  her. “Nanoha-chan…?” The brown haired girl’s body spasmed,  making her grip get tighter and hurting Fate enough to wake up fully  “Ow! What’s wrong with you!?” The light above their bed came on  the dimmest setting, finally allowing Fate to see her friend.  “Nanoha-chan!? Nanoha what’s wrong!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The suffocating girl  met her friend’s eyes, silently pleading for help. Her hand against  her nightgown finally tore the first button loose and she placed the  hand on her chest, scratching at it. “Contact: Shamal!” Fate  screamed, undoing the buttons on her friend’s shirt as a  transparent monitor appeared in front of her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We are sorry, the  person you are calling is unavailable-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Emergency contact!”  Fate cried again, seeing several claw marks on her friend’s chest  where she had apparently been scratching herself in her sleep. The  monitor turned to a dark room. “Shamal! Shamal! Wake up! <em>Shamal!</em>”  a moment later the monitor brightened up as the lights in the mage’s  room came on and she sat up. “Nanoha’s not breathing!” She  called, voice cracking as tears poured down her face. “She’s  suffocating!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Instantly awake, the  green mage scrambled out of bed. “Details,” she managed out,  scrambling for a few supplies, tripping over her chair in her hurry.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I-I don’t know!”  She panicked. “Her eyes are wide, she’s trying to tear into her  chest and her mouth is bleeding!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is she breathing at  all!?” Shamal found what she needed and barged out of her room,  monitor following in front of her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate leaned over her  friend’s mouth and listened, holding her own breath to try and keep  the sounds as silent as she could. “In very small puffs, she’s  exhaling more than inhaling!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha looked up at her  friend, starting to not panic as much anymore but rather finding  herself starting to get sleepy again. Sound was starting to get  farther and farther away, despite Fate being right there, yelling at  her to open her eyes again. ‘<em>It’d be so easy to go to sleep…</em>’  her mind thought as her vision was finally robbed from her. ‘<em>So  easy…so easy…</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Pain was the next thing  she felt. Her nose was clamped and Fate’s lips were on hers,  forcing air into her lungs. Now finally with lungful of air, she did  the first thing that she possibly could, and screamed in terror and  pain.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lung paralysis,”  Shamal was telling Fate. “In short it makes it so her lungs can’t  move, therefore suffocating her. Her throat was probably hurt by  whatever she breathed in. Just keep doing CPR, no matter what you  hear me? I don’t care if you punch her to make her exhale!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate pushed Nanoha’s  hands down and pinned them, pressing her mouth against hers again and  filling her lungs with air once again. The pain returned ten fold,  making Nanoha once again let out a death defiling scream of agony.  Her body twisted under Fate’s hold, trying with everything it had  to get away from what was making her hurt. Tears poured down her face  from her closed eyes, running into her ears before finally seeping  into her hair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The door to the room  opened and all at once the lights cut on. “Up here!” Fate called,  seeing the girl fly up to them and land on the bed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hold her mouth  open.” Shamal ordered, getting a light and looking down the girl’s  throat as she bit harshly on Fate’s fingers. “Thought so,” She  frowned, opening her purse and taking out a rather large looking  inhaler device. “Nanoha!” The name made the girl look, fear  evident in her eyes once again. “Breath this in! you can do it!”  She wrestled with the girl, putting the mouthpiece behind her lips.  “Go!” she pulled the lever, making the girl’s cheeks puff out  as air was shot into her. When it was removed, Nanoha gave a violent  coughing fit, small glittering flakes coming out in masses, covered  lightly in blood. “Again!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate struggled to hold  the girl, pain tearing into her own heart at the pain she was causing  her best friend and secret love. Twice she had to press down roughly  on her chest to get the girl to exhale; both times sure she left a  bruise. The method of making her inhale from the device went on seven  times before finally she coughed out, starting to spit as well. A  ragged intake of air happened next and Shamal helped her over so she  was on her hands and knees, coughing and spitting out blood and  flecks of the glittery like substance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Breathe in this and  exhale,” Shamal told her gently, offering her a smaller inhaler.  “It’ll hurt but keep at it.” Nanoha nodded weakly, sucking in  the device and exhaling slowly before repeating.  Fate rubbed her  back gently, trying to encourage her as best she could. “I thought  she might have hurt her throat on her mission,” She informed Fate  softly. “I didn’t know it would be this bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’ll be okay,  right?” Fate was crying in earnest now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes she’ll be  fine.” Shamal encouraged her, gently taking Nanoha’s wrist so she  could count the pulse. When done, she looked back over at Fate. “She  inhaled something that caused a slow paralysis of the lungs. If she  didn’t get treated she would have certainly died…” She felt her  own heart ache at the expression Fate just gave her. “Don’t fret  now,” She hastily added. “Fortunately it was a rather weak  substance, so she’ll be completely okay in about a week. Until then  she will need to use an inhaler to help clean her lungs and dissipate  anything left in there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha slowly started  to get her breathing under control, weakly falling against Fate and  resting against her body. “Ou….Ouch…” She whispered, eyes  closed. “Ow… Ow… Ow…” Once again tears came to her eyes and  she allowed herself to cry again. “I was…” Her breath caught as  she sobbed. “So scared!” Her arms grabbed a hold of Fate’s and  held tight. “Fate! Fate!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shamal felt a tear come  to her own eye as well, seeing one of her best friends reduced to a  shivering little girl, clinging onto the only form of support she  had. “If she can breathe enough to cry and talk at the same time, I  say the worst is over.” She allowed Fate to stroke Nanoha’s hair  and whisper to the girl while she got a few things from her purse.  “Here,” She gently put a small yellow necklace around Nanoha’s  neck. “This will monitor her breathing. If it gets anywhere close  to being abnormal, it’ll alert me immediately.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” Fate  whispered, holding her friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s safe to rest  now,” Shamal put the inhalers on their desk and closed her purse.  “Do you mind if I sleep here tonight?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not at all,” Fate  answered instantly, watching her smile and gently stroke Nanoha’s  hair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll be  downstairs. Don’t worry, it’s over now.” With that, she nodded  at Fate and made her way downstairs so the two could spend some time  alone and calm down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha…are you  okay?” Fate said the words gently as the lights went off around  them, now only being illuminated by the small dim light above their  bed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes…” She  answered softly, voice a little horse. “I’m okay…” To prove  the point to herself, or Fate, she took a long slow intake through  her nose and let it out even slower. “Wow, air taste good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate let out a small  tear stained chuckle. “If you can joke like that, you’ll be fine,  huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmhmm…” Nanoha  nodded weakly. “Please keep holding me, Fate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course,” She  shifted so her back was resting against the headboard of the bed and  Nanoha was laying against her, between her legs and in her arms.  “Nanoha, I was so scared too…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry,” She  whispered back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t apologize  you silly girl,” A small tear dropped onto Nanoha’s hair. “If I  ever lost you, I’d… I don’t know what I’d do…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan…”  Nanoha turned to look up at her, “Will you kiss me, Fate-chan?”  The words shocked her friendly lightly. “When I was about to  sleep...” She took a small breath. “I thought… just for a  moment... That I was going to die without ever kissing you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate nodded, leaning  over and gently kissing Nanoha’s lips. The intimate moment lasted  three seconds before she pulled back and immediately kissed her  forehead as well. “Nanoha…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That sounds kind of  nice,” She admitted, looking up at her. “When we’re alone…can  I call you ‘Fate’?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. You can  call me whatever you want.” She nuzzled her friend, still crying  slightly. “Oh god, Nanoha… There were so many things that ran  through my mind. So many things I wanted to say…” For once, it  didn’t seem hard to even think about saying it anymore. Her fears  were gone and all that mattered at the moment was letting her know;  to tell her friend what she had been keeping to herself for so long  “Nanoha; I love you, Nanoha. I really, <em>really</em> love you.”  Fate bent over and wrapped the girl tighter in a hug. “It’s okay  if you don’t feel the same, I just have to let you know…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course I love  you,” She replied in a whisper. “I’ve always loved Fate.” Her  arms wrapped around her and she contently laid against her shoulder,  breathing out as steady as she could. “I was just waiting until you  were comfortable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Silly girl…”  Fate sniffed, wiping her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nya…haha.”</span></p>
