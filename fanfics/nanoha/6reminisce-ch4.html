<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My hands  shook nervously while I waited impatiently for my friend to arrive.  Ironically Fate's normal garage just so happen to have a towing service  as well so when they showed up to remove the now flame-free wreckage  they offered me a ride back to their office so I wouldn't have to sit  on the street corner while waiting for someone to come get me.  Currently the entire staff at the garage were all huddled around what  used to be their best piece of work. The car barely resembled itself  anymore, being nothing more than a burnt, broken frame and broken  glass. Sora, the owner of the garage and one of Fate's best friends,  sat down across from me in his office and gave me a look that clearly  told me I was probably going to be impaled by Bardiche when my fiancée  found out what had happened. I smiled nervously at him but he just  closed his eyes and sadly shook his head. I swallowed thickly and  suddenly felt like I was going to be sick. After a quick question he  directed me to their bathroom, where I quickly walked to and proceeded  to throw up due to the sheer nervousness and dread hanging over me.  After rinsing out my mouth and waiting a moment to see if I would make  it or not, I left the small room and saw Signum's car pulling up into  the parking spaces. I felt a little better seeing my friend step out of  the car but my stomach turned knots again when Fate also got out.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By: Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  quickly ran outside and greeted them nervously. “Um, hi,” She started,  rubbing her hands together frantically in an effort to calm herself  down. “Um, Fate, I, um, kind of sort of put a dent in your car!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  blinked. “Oh...” The girl licked her lips, taking a small moment to  herself before putting on a fake smile for her. “That's okay.” She  started to walk past her but Nanoha jumped back and stood in front of  her again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,” She started again, stumbling over her words.  “It's kind of... a big dent...” Fate's eyes widened at the news and her  already obviously upset expression suddenly got worse. “Um, um, um...  Maybe a scratch or two...and, um, well, the tires...and um...” She  tried to keep Fate from running past her. “I'll take care of it all I  promise! So, so,” She finally allowed Fate past her when the woman  snatched her arm back from Nanoha's hold. “Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh  god...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It can't be that bad can it?” Signum asked, placing a  hand on her shoulder. To answer her question all of the staff quickly  came running from the back of the shop where Fate's car was, each  saying they didn't want to be anywhere near her when the blond saw it.  “Okay, maybe it is that bad...Sorry, Fate heard I was going to meet you  so she tagged along...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha walked along side Signum back  around the building and over to where her fiancée was standing in front  of the wreck. She watched her slowly walk around the remains with wide  eyes. For a moment she thought that Fate would be too shocked to be  angry but after a minute of inspecting the girl suddenly kicked the  remains and pushed both her arms down, fist clenched and shoulders  shaking. Fate turned around and glared her her, storming closer to them  and panting heavily in anger. When she was close enough Fate reared  back her fist and swung at the girl. Nanoha closed her eyes tightly and  waited for the hit. When nothing came she slowly allowed her eyes to  open and look at the fist hovering a few inches away from her. Fate's  hand opened and closed a few times before she thrust both her hands  down by her side again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You <em>destroyed</em> my car!” The words finally came. “What the hell, Nanoha!?” She threw a finger towards the scrap. “How is that <em>possible</em>!? HUH!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha swallowed back her tears. “I... Shot down a drone onto it and blew it up...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  looked like she wanted to try hitting her again. “You can control your  spells perfectly!” Fate yelled in her face. “How did you manage to  screw up this bad!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Signum put a hand on Fate's shoulder. “Fate,  maybe you.” She watched the blond move her shoulder and continue to  yell at the one in front of her. “... Maybe not...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I-I'm sorry!” Nanoha finally started crying.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry  doesn't' cover it!” Fate put her nose against hers and screamed.  “That's my only release from work, and you destroyed it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn't mean to!” The brown haired girl's voice broke, chocking on her own gasp for air. “R-really!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate stomped on the ground, hands shaking furiously, before turning and storming off. “Lets so, Signum.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let's <em>go</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Signum  turned to look at Nanoha, who had fallen to her knees and was covering  her mouth with one hand while holding her stomach with the other. “I'll  talk to her,” Signum spoke calmly. “And I'll get Yuuno to come get  you.” She pat the girl's back briefly before standing and walking over  to her car.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha looked up a little and saw Fate slam the car  door before hitting the dashboard repeatedly with her fist. Slowly she  sat down on the ground and hugged her knees, crying between them. She  wasn't sure how long she sat there but after a while she saw the last  of the day's light being cut off from her. Looking up, she saw Yuuno  offering her a hand to help stand. Nanoha slowly reached up to take it  and allowed her friend to put an arm around her while walking towards  his ride. “You got here fast,” She finally spoke after he got in his  car as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was already on my way,” He replied softly before  backing out and heading back to the base. “They went to Fuji's so I  don't think Fate will be back until late.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate  slammed down the shot quickly and crashed the glass onto the bar top in  front of her. “Giv' me 'nother.” Her words slurred together, making it  hard to fully understand her.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think you've had enough,” Signum corrected her. “Fate this is stupid, you never drink shots.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  dun wanna sip all'night.” She told her, leaning over as she talked and  finally fell over onto her. “Stop makin' tha room spin!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kuhn set  another shot in front of Fate and watched Signum's response happily.  “Relax,” he told her with a grin. “The last four have been nothing but  carbonated water.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Signum's glare turned into a smirk. “Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  what happened?” The blue haired man started cleaning some of his  glasses since it was a slow night for him, as many people didn't drink  on Lightsday due to a religion. “Fate-chan never drinks like this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha  blew up'mah car,” Fate informed him, still leaning against her friend.  She frowned darkly. “I'm gonna blow'up 'er training field...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  you're not.” Signum sighed. “I swear, sometimes she's the most mature  and calm person I know, then I turn around and remember she's only  nineteen...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hard headed?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes. Very.” Signum stroked  Fate's hair in an attempt to make her sleepy. “When she decides to do  something, she does it. Trying to adopt Elio when she was seventeen,  joining the military when she was eleven... believe it or not, this  girl here is very dedicated. Nanoha is really lucky to have her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sometimes I wonder,” Fate muttered, voice slowly getting weaker as her weakness was being pet. “I almost hit 'er.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you didn't,” Signum sighed. “I think I'm going to regret coming here tonight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kuhn smirked. “Oh yeah. Fate always starts telling everyone how much she loves them and then berates herself when she's drunk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't remind me...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“An...An...”  Fate was still talking, despite no one listening to her. “And she  always...always... leaves her clothes out and I trip over'em...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why me?” Signum continued to stroke Fate's hair, wondering how long it would take before she fell asleep.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Signum  waved the unconscious Fate's hand by the scanner next to her door and  heard it unlock. After shifting her lightly the woman managed to open  the door and walk into the loft apartment. To her surprise Nanoha leapt  up from the couch and ran over to her. “You stayed up,” Signum spoke  the obvious as she handed the girl over to her.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was worried,” Nanoha accepted Fate and cradled her in her arms. “Did she say anything?...You think she's mad at me...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Signum  crossed her arms and smiled lightly. “She was going to drown you in the  shower, cook you in the oven, tear you apart and play your lungs like  bag pipes, then use your life insurance to buy a new car.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Oh...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Signum placed a hand on her head and ruffled her hair. “She also broke into tears because she almost hit you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. Put her to bed and get some rest yourself.” Signum nodded at her before leaving the two alone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  looked down at the girl in her arms and slowly carried her up the  stairs and awkwardly crawled across the bed to set her down against the  wall. The motion made the drunk girl wake up and hazily open her eyes.  “Go back to sleep,” Nanoha told her softly. “You're home now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Go  away...” Fate closed her eyes again and once more passed out. The blue  eyed girl looked at her sadly a moment before hanging her head. Slowly  she reached out for two of the numerous pillows on the bed and walked  downstairs to sleep on the couch.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Morning came slowly, waking up  Nanoha early since the sunlight hit her on the couch before it normally  made it's way over to the bed upstairs. With a small groan she sat up  and swung her legs off the couch. The girl let out a loud yawn while  walking towards the kitchen and rubbing her eyes. Still half asleep,  her hands went to work grabbing coffee beans and pouring them into her  grinder. A few pulses later she was rewarded with a dusty powder that  she poured into a filter and topped with hot water already warmed from  their timer. No sooner than they started to soak Nanoha heard the front  door open. Turning around, she caught the tail end of Fate's hair fly  behind the door and see it close loudly. She looked from the door then  back to the coffee then once more to the door. Finally she reached over  and gently clicked off the coffee pot warmer and poured what she had  into the sink before throwing away grinds she had just done. Nanoha  walked out of the kitchen and went to the stairs, rubbing a hand across  her eyes once and sniffing before getting ready for her day.</span></p>

“You want me to do what?” Elio almost laughed. “I don't work for you.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you want more information,” Jail told him with an amused look. “You  will do as I require.” He formed a monitor in the air and slid it over  to him. “That contains all the information on Project F, more than your  precious Fate will ever be able to find out on her own. Get me what I  want, and I'll tell you the password to unlock it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The boy looked down at the monitor, displaying 'enter password' over and over on it. “Why should I trust you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  that information contains nothing the government doesn't already know  about me, nor anything that could possibly stop what I'm doing. To me,  it's useless garbage I learned longer back than you've been alive. But  to you...I suppose you've waited a long time to get a hold of it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're sick.” Elio growled. “When I get out of here...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You'll  what?” Jail smirked. “You are no threat to me, and even if you do  reveal this base I can vacate and have another one running within a  week's time. The only reason you are still here is because my Lutecia  wishes it to be so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Strada!” Elio heard his device on Lutecia's  wrist confirm his voice. “Store data.” The AI gave him an error message  but Lutecia waved her hand over it. “Try again.” This time he got an  accepted note and flew the monitor over to Lutecia, who raised her arm  and caught it into his watch.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Jail looked over at Lutecia. “Would you like Zest to accompany you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  thank you, he still needs rest.” Lutecia bowed lightly before turning.  Elio followed her out back onto the military base and punched the wall  next to him when they made it outside. “Don't hurt yourself, please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How can you work with someone like that!?” Elio yelled at her. “What makes you think he's not just using you too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you, I need to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  don't have to! Shari-san can come up with something to help you! She  made Caro-hime's gloves! If you come to my side, I'm sure we could work  something out. Even Fate-san used to be a dimensionally wanted criminal  stealing logia before she met Nanoha-san.” Lutecia looked over at him  and met his eyes. “...What...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No one... has ever tried to go out of their way for me before...” She looked away. “I don't know what to say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say you'll give it a try?” Elio put his hands onto her shoulders. “Lutecia...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked up at him again, a blush on her face. “But if I leave now...”  With a small step she stood closer to him. “I won't have anything  keeping you near me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lutecia.” Elio took a small step back and  felt like kicking himself when her face fell sadly. “Look, I kind of  get the idea you want to be with me but... but I already promised my  loyalty to section six and the dragon princess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro-chan...” Lutecia started walking again, letting Elio catch up to her. “She had it as bad as I did, back then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  were experimented on together...” Lutecia looked at her hands. “I used  to hold her when she cried... I thought... “ She turned to look at him  again. “We kind of look the same, despite our hair and eyes...so I  thought of her as my little sister.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're... Not a bad person, are you Lutecia?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  girl stopped walking a moment. “I...don't know. What I'm doing is wrong  but...I can't live unless it's done. I don't have a choice.” She shook  her head, voice suddenly flowing smooth again. “We should go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio licked his lips. '<em>She's holding back her emotions again... I can't even begin to imagine the fake ideas Jail put into this girl's head...</em>' With a sigh he continued. “Where are we going exactly?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Far. We can make it in half an hour if we fly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can't fly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't know how,” He replied easily enough.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can let you fly.” Lutecia walked over to him. “If you want?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“By  giving you armor capable of it.” She offered a small smile. “Be my  knight...?” She reached up to him but stopped herself before touching  his cheek. “...Please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio gave her a sad look before reaching up and taking her hand, bringing it down. “Someone can take us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Yes.” She started to take her hand back but found Elio interlacing their fingers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If this will make you less sad, I don't mind.” He gave her a lopsided smile. '<em>She will hold on to me regardless anyway.</em>'</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes...” Her lips turned up into the first true smile from her he's ever seen. “ It makes me happy..”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Tia  looked at her instructor inquisitively. She had been standing there the  past minute just staring into space, even after she had destroyed all  the target balls thrown at her. Normally at a time like this she would  call out to her and snap her back to the training but after her last  'flying lesson' she still had some pent up frustration she needed to  release. The gun slinger moved silently around to her back, sneaking up  on the teacher and yelling right behind her. “<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Incoming enemy attack!!!</span></em>”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  screamed out loudly, staggering forward and pointing her staff into the  sky, turning around several times to try and find her enemies. When she  finally realized Tia was smirking at her she let down her guard and  panted out heavily, scared out of her mind. “I'm going,” She took a  long intake of air. “To court marshal you, Tiana.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is something  bothering you?” She slid twirled her gun into it's card form and  slipped it into her pocket. “You have been a little out of it, even  more than usual.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The teacher scratched her cheek with one finger. “Am I really that out of it while teaching you...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh,  um, no no...” She waved her hands. “I didn't mean it like that. It just  seems that today you've...Ugh, I'm not good at this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you,” She offered her a smile. “I appreciate the effort. I'm sorry,  I'll pay more attention now.” Before she could continue her thought a  screen appeared in front of her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha, I have a lock on Elio!”  Yuuno told her while running down a hallway. “I'm going to the control  room right now to inform the others, could you round up your team?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes!” Nanoha saluted him briskly out of habit. “Tiana, go to Subaru, I'll get Fate and Caro-chan!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma'am!” She saluted quickly before running off while the other took to the sky.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate!”  Nanoha dropped from the air and landed next to her friend. “Yuuno got a  lock- will you listen to me!?- He got a lock on Elio!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro,  we're scrambling!” Fate ran over to her and wrapped her arms around the  girl's waist before flying off towards the control room, leaving Nanoha  behind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...I know you're upset at me, mou.” Nanoha leapt into  the air as well, seeing Subaru's wing road rip up from the other side  of the training ground. '<em>It'll probably be another day before she talks to me...</em>'</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno  greeted them when the last of the group came in through the large  window and stood at attention. “We found Elio,” He got straight to the  point, bringing up a monitor that showed the boy fighting something  that looked like a giant worm. “He's about two hours be helicopter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How far by personal flight?” Fate asked instantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Flying  at how you probably would, still an hour and a half, and you'll also be  too exhausted magically to do anything once you're there.” Shari  crunched the numbers for her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Deploy by helicopter right away!”  Hayate threw out her hand. “Riot force six, scramble!” She watched them  all run out the door and turn down the hallway to get to the stairs  leading to the helicopter pad. “Yuuno-kun, you didn't tell them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuno  looked at the monitor and observed Lutecia wielding Strada. “I'll tell  them ten minutes before they get there. Right now I need them  completely calm to prepare what they're going to do when they get  there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate smiled to herself. “You're quite the strategist  aren't you?” She got a brief nod in return. “Come here,” She pet the  arm rest of her chair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What am I, a dog?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Will you wag your tail if I say yes?” She teased up at him. “Will you help me command?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only if you buy dinner after that comment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Consider  it done,” She waved her hand out to form monitors. “Help me think of  possible scenarios and counter plan for them if you would?”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Elio  slid in the sand and panted out, glaring at the huge beast in front of  him. His hand gripped the standard spear device and growled deep in his  throat when he remembered he couldn't load cartridges into it. “What I  desire,” the words made him look to the side and see Lutecia's  summoning circle spread out around her. “Those which beat the wings and  cause the roar of wind,” She continued while Elio jumped into the air  and spun around, ripping another hole into his opponent. “Wasp storm.”  She pointed with one hand towards the worm several stories tall. As  soon as her target was accepted the sand around them exploded into  life. Countless wasp flew up and covered it, each stinging repeatedly.  The attack only lasted ten seconds at the most before the horde of  insects all flew away, dispersing into the skies. Elio looked at the  worm who seemed unaffected by the attack. He prepared himself to strike  again but Lutecia took a hold of his sleeve and shook her head. The boy  turned his gaze once more to the beast and swallowed thickly when hives  started breaking out on it and bursting.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Remind me...” He started, turning and walking while the thing died. “To never piss you off...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” She didn't look too pleased, however.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't like killing...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was a beast.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was still alive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio stopped walking and looked at her back a moment before she stopped as well. “Lutecia...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?” Her voice was still calm, still smooth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't...talk to me like that, I don't like it. If you're angry at something I said, say so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia looked down,  clasping her hands in front of her. “I... don't want to risk losing control.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you're trying to suppress your emotions, you're a fool.” He walked  through the sand over to her and wiped the sweat from his forehead.  “Because when you think you're being calm and collected, you're really  so sad you don't know anything else. Lutecia I don't know what  Scaglietti has told you but he's obviously telling you lies. Let us  help!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Elio!” Lutecia was shocked at the tone of her own voice. “Please... I have to, I don't have a choice!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  do!” He grabbed her arms. “Don't let him bully you like this!” Elio  allowed the girl to cling to his chest. “Lutecia, give me back Strada,  let's leave and go to section six. I'll take care of you, I promise.  Trust me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I want to...” She whispered. “But as soon as you're not bound to me you'll leave... and I'll be alone again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I won't leave you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia gripped him harder. “Let's... finish this mission...I'm hot, I don't want to talk here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay.”  He moved his arms so she could back away from him and for the first  time didn't mind it when she took his hand. “So the dig site is around  here, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes. An ancient city was found under the sand of  this desert. From what was found, the civilization was standard for the  time it was dated to, but there is significant evidence to imply that  this city had a power source to keep the heat from being unbearable and  also supplied them with water. Our goal is to find that item and bring  it back to base.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio topped a sand dune and stood there,  looking over what appeared to be a rather large hole dug in the ground.  Several machines were around, most of which were a type used to dig.  “Looks like this city did pretty well for itself.” His eyes looked  around. “It has to be two miles long at least and it's not even  completely uncovered yet...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes. The crew is not working today,  there have been many sand creatures appearing lately. We need to hurry  before a squad is sent to take care of them and catch us here.” The  girl put Strada back into it's watch form and started to walk down the  sand dune. A section caved in under her, making the girl fall and slide  down quickly. Elio gripped her hand harder and slid down next to her,  keeping her from falling and rolling all the way down to the bottom.  “...Thanks,” She seemed a little shaken by the sudden fall.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you want to thank me, can I <em>please</em> at least use my barrier jacket?” He fanned the top of his shirt. “This black is killing me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bestow  barrier jacket.” Lutecia pointed at him, forming the fabric around his  body. “There you are.” Raising her other hand, she also called hers.  Although her dress was black, it also showed her stomach, making the  girl feel a little better.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks, I didn't think you'd actually  do it.” Elio looked himself over, pleased to finally have a portion of  his power back. “So the AMF field on me...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is off right now,”  she finished for him, idly walking around and looking. “Telepathy won't  work, though. There is still a jamming barrier around you coming from  the band on your ankle. I don't want you to get hurt so I was able to  release the AMF.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can I have Strada back?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio  sighed out. “Fine...” He looked around a little more before catching up  with her and allowing the girl to once again grip his hand. “I have a  bad feeling... Like something is going on we don't know about...”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fate  sighed out when Yuuno's monitor blipped out. “Okay, Lutecia has Elio  under her control right now. For whatever reason, Elio has to follow  her until he can arm himself again with his device. Our first priority  is to get into contact with him, then isolate him and Lutecia. Once  done, depending on what Elio can tell us, we will either pull back or  press on if there is a complication.” She got a salute from the three  members. “Nanoha,” The girl looked at her hopefully. “Scan the area for  Elio's personal signal.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...Yes ma'am.” Nanoha closed her eyes,  ignoring the sudden looks she was getting. “I can feel Strada, but not  Elio. He probably has a jamming field around him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Figures.”  Fate bit her nails but found Nanoha's hand on he wrist pulling them  away out of instinct. The two looked at each other a moment before Fate  turned her gaze. “I'm still not talking to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry.” Nanoha  took her hand back and looked over at the rest. “We will be one group  this time, so listen to Fate for your orders. She does this for a  living so don't question her when she tells you to do something, even  if you don't understand it okay?” She got a few nods before Vice  informed them that they would be landing soon. “Well then... All you.”  She looked over at her fiancée.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blond nodded and covered her  eyes when the hatch opened up. Sand flew around them but she still ran  out and leapt the few feet to the ground, crouching to absorb the  impact and sinking to her ankles in the ground. She heard four sounds  behind her before Vice backed off and the noise from the blades faded.  “Let's move,” She darted forward, ignoring the heat coming over her  from the cape of her jacket. The five ran through the sand before  dropping and sliding along the dunes down towards the dig site. “This  way,” she ran quickly, eyes looking around the stone buildings and  scanning the ground for footprints. “Nanoha, scan again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  nodded and quickly combed the area mentally, using everything Yuuno had  taught her about scanning magic. The results came back, making her  almost falter in her stride. Sliding to a stop she scanned again,  getting the same result. “Fate...<em>he's</em> here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What!?” Fate quit running and looked back over at her. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Him</em>.”  She repeated, clenching her fist. “ Jail Scaglietti...” Her eyes glared  into the distance, eying a man leaning against the door frame of a  several story tall stone building. “I can feel him, I can smell him, I  can <em>see him!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You three, continue the search,” Fate  jogged over to Nanoha and looked where she was. “This is an emergency  change in plans. Tia, you're in charge.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But ma'am!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Go!”  The two older girls screamed at the same time, flying quickly into the  air and spinning around each other as they charged the man who was  walking into the building.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia looked over at the two people now  under her command. “You heard her, let's move out!” She started  running, pulling out her pistols as she did so. “Be on guard, people  know we're here now so we need to get to Elio as fast as possible  before they pull out!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha and Fate landed on the balcony of  the stone building and pressed their backs against the door. The two  nodded at each other briefly before each running into the building at  the same time and pointing their weapons. A glowing white-ish haze  screamed around them, forcing both to their knees. Nanoha gasped out,  panting for air, as her barrier jacket phased out from around her and  Raising Heart returned to it's gem form. “An AMF!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Powerful,”  Fate pushed herself up, now in her standard black enforcer outfit.  “It's a trap!” The door behind them suddenly collapsed on itself,  making the two scramble farther into the room. “Dammit...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like a moth to the flame,” A new voice spoke up. “You two never learn, do you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha growled. “Show yourself, Scaglietti!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right  here,” The area around them lit up brightly, revealing a large room  that had half the ceiling caved in. Jail was on the floor above them,  standing near the edge. “What do you plan to do? You are both  powerless.” He paced while talking. “Always depending on magic like the  fools you are. Science is the true mystery of the universe!” The blond  nodded over at Nanoha and waited until she got a nod back before  running over to her and jumping. The brown haired girl caught her boots  with both her hands and thrust upwards as Fate jumped again. She  grabbed the floor Jail was standing on and grabbed Nanoha's hand when  she jumped. Along with the force, she managed to get her hand up as  well before they both climbed up. “Resourceful as always,” Jail mused.  “Tell me, isn't it embarrassing jumping around and flying in those mini  skirts?” The man dodged Fate's melee attacks and danced away from her  when Nanoha also joined in. He caught her ankle when she tried to land  a kick on his head and held it. “Oh, pink with lace, how nice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  jerked her foot back and took a few steps back to gain distance.  “You're still a sick, perverted bastard as you've always been,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Jail  held up his hand and formed a barrier when Fate tried to attack him  from behind. “Fate, Fate, Fate... What am I going to do with you?” with  a flick of his wrist he sent her flying over his head and crashing into  her girlfriend. “Without your magic you are nothing but a normal girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  pushed herself up and spat a little blood from where she bit her lip.  “You're nothing but a normal man with toys,” She looked around. “Where  are you hiding your devices?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If I told you, where would the fun  be?” Jail casually waved his hand, sending Fate flying back several  feet and crashing into the wall, leaving cracks where she hit. He  turned his gaze to Nanoha, who was seething at him. The first attack  was blocked by his shield but the second shattered it. The third hit  landed on his stomach making the man grunt. To avoid the fourth, he  glared at her, sending her flying back and crashing onto the floor.  “Very nice,” he rubbed the spot where he was hit. “I see you havn't  been slacking on your hand to hand fighting.” He heard an explosion  behind him and turned to see Fate slamming another small device into  the ground. “You...!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate flared forward, landing several hits  on the man since the device making his shield was destroyed. “It's  going to end, Scaglietti!” She screamed at him. “I won't forgive anyone  who tries to play god!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Get <em>off</em> of me!” He raised his  hand, slinging the girl into the ceiling and watching her collapse in  front of him. “You can't even begin to understand the technology I  possess!” He avoided another onslaught from Nanoha by blurring around  her and slamming a fist into her gut. “My devices give me power that  makes your foolish magic look like child's play.” Jail let Nanoha fall  to her knees and grab her stomach. “Just with this one arm,” The man  removed his science lab coat and revealed that his right arm was  altered to look like a cross between a normal arm and that of a  robot's. “I can channel all the telepathic abilities I possess into it  and amplify it a hundred fold! You girls know nothing of the wonders  science can do to better humans!” His eyes turned to Fate. “You  disappoint me. I thought by now you would embrace what you are!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I am a human being!” She countered him. “I may have been born a copy but I will die an original!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, Fate, how amusing.” Jail grabbed Nanoha's hair and hoisted her up, punching her stomach again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't  you touch her!” The blond ran forward but had to stop to catch Nanoha  when she was thrown at her. “Rest,” She told her, laying the coughing  girl on the ground and frowned when she curled into a fetal position to  try and get the air back that was robbed from her. “I'm going to kill  you, Scaglietti!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You've promised that for years and have failed  to uphold it, Fate.” He raised his hand and taunted her into attacking  one again. When she was close enough he snapped his fingers, making the  girl freeze in her tracks. “Unlike your binding spells,” He started,  walking to the frozen girl casually. “My binds are complete. You can't  even move your fingers can you?” Once he was close enough he trailed a  finger along her cheek. “My, my, you grow more beautiful by the day.”  The glare he received made him smile. “But you know what I like most  about you? Besides your bust of course?” His hand went over her body,  trailing over her breast.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'll <em>kill you!</em>” Nanoha's voice echoed around the room, pink energy starting to wisp around her as she struggled to push herself up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As  expected,” Jail noticed. “Your anger increases your magic to the point  where the AMF cannot contain it anymore.” He ran his hand over Fate's  stomach</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha screamed again, eyes going red. “Get your <em>filthy hands</em> off my fiancée!” Her body burned, the magic summoned being neutralized  as soon as she formed it. “Come on... COME ON!!” The sound of a tuning  fork rang into her ears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Jail moved his hand out again, forcing the power of the field onto her. “Don't try it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come  on... come on...” Nanoha glared at him, reaching behind her back and  gripping air. “Phase Shift: Signum!!” The blood red sword came to her  call. White and pink armor started to form around her body, swirling  and hazing in and out of view. Still screaming, she ran forward and  raised the sword to strike, stopping it instantly when Jail held up  Fate as a shield.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Die.” The single word came paired with  electricity flaring around the girl. Another device activated, shooting  a white haze directly into her, nullifying the energy she had managed  to form. When the attack was over Nanoha sank to her knees, once again  only in her flight uniform. “Since you draw so much power from seeing  her in trouble... I wonder how it will feel to be the cause of her  death?” Jail reached down and grabbed Nanoha's shirt, dragging her  along the floor to the edge, where the ground broke off revealing the  floor below them. “You know, Fate,” He spoke into her ear while the  girl struggled to just be able to move again. “Your hair is what I love  most about you,” He ran his hand through the silken threads. “But the  best thing about hair is: by itself it is weak and fragile.” To prove  his point he plucked a single thread from her head. “But... when  grouped together...” This time he grabbed a fistful and yanked hard,  pulling her head back. “The breaking point is increased as the  thousands of threads share the force. Just as a bridge can be held up  by twisting weak strings of metal, your hair can support weight easily  when done right.” He pulled her hair up and grabbed the ribbon at the  end, twisting it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha coughed out, starting to push herself up. “I'm not... done yet...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Jail  waited until she stood before hitting her stomach again when she took a  breath. When the girl doubled over he wrapped Fate's twisted hair  around her neck and tied it into a knot. “So, what will happen now?” He  forced Fate to the floor and grinned, making several rings of kinetic  energy pin her to the ground, leaving one hand free. “Will you hang  your lover, or will her weight break your neck first?” He kicked  Nanoha's chest and watched her fall to the ground before sliding off  the edge and falling. Fate screamed loudly as the bind on her was  released, hand instantly going to grip the mass of twisted hair and  pull on it to keep the weight from her head. “As much as I want to  watch you two kill each other, I have more pressing matters to attend  to.” With those words, he flew backwards and raised his hand, calling  all his devices around the room to him except the AMF one. Once  collected he leapt out a window and into the sunlight.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!” Fate pulled harder on her hair, wincing as her lover's choking sounds suddenly got worse. '<em>If I pull up, I'll choke her even more... If I don't, her weight will break my neck!</em>'  Her eyes closed tightly, struggling against the binds holding her on  the floor. No magic came to her call despite how much she screamed.  Almost half a minute went by before Nanoha went still, whimpering.  “Nanoha!? <em>Nanoha!?</em>” She could feel it inside that she wasn't dead. '<em>Oh my god, she's suffocating herself so her struggling won't make it so hard to hold her up!</em>'  Tears came to her eyes. “Stop it!” She yelled out. “Don't die, you can  pull yourself up, just grab my hair!” Nanoha didn't move. “Damn it  Nanoha, do it! I won't let you die! Don't worry about me!” Still there  was no response. Fate looked to the side sadly. “Nanoha, do it! My neck  will break anyway, save yourself!” Gasping out, her eyes went wide,  seeing a rock neck to her. It looked as if it had been broken in half  at a sharp angle. Desperately she let go of her hair and grabbed it.  The weight she felt was immediate, forcing her to try and lift all the  mass with just the muscles on her neck and shoulders. Reaching back,  she started stabbing blindly at her hair. She felt the strands start to  rip and break, making her jab even more frantically at it. After a few  seconds she reared back and thrust again, finally destroying enough of  her hair for the rest to start to break. All at once she felt her hair  give and heard a loud crash under her where Nanoha fell.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  gasped out loudly, rolling over onto her hands and knees and taking  long ragged intakes of air. Once she was able to, she stood and  scrambled her way over to the side, where she climbed up some rubble to  be able to reach the floor above her. “Fate! Fate, answer me!” The mass  of golden hair started falling from around her shoulders and onto the  floor.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey...” She moaned out. “You okay...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate!”  Nanoha ignored the sharp piece of rock and pulled herself up  desperately, cutting herself and scraping her body. “Fate! Fate!” Once  up she grabbed a hold of a spherical object and raised it above her  head before bringing it down onto a pile of rocks. The device sparked,  burning her hands, but she kept on until it finally gave up and died.  “Just a second...” Nanoha formed a ball of magic in front of her finger  now that the AMF device was no longer active. The ball shot each ring  over her, freeing the girl. “Fate...!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha...” She smiled to  herself when her fiancée fell on top of her and hugged tightly. “You  idiot...don't you ever do something like that again...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha coughed out and cried, holding her closer. “You're the idiot!” She protested. “I couldn't do something to hurt you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly  Fate reached up and embraced her back. “I'd give my life for you  anytime,” She whispered into her ear. “There's no question about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So...” She took a breath. “When I tell you to do something, do it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  couldn't risk killing you,” Nanoha whispered back, sobbing silently. “I  just couldn't...Even if you're not speaking to me, I can't-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha.”  She spoke softly but the word still made the other girl stop talking.  “I didn't talk to you because I was scared I'd say something to hurt  your feelings; don't think even for a moment I ever loved you any less.  You have any idea how much it hurt to know I almost hit you? I cried  and cried and cried...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sniffing, Nanoha pulled back enough to  put their foreheads together and kiss her quickly. “I'm sorry; I really  am. But right now I just want to know you're okay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you want to make it up to me, “ Fate smiled, obviously in pain now that her adrenaline was wearing off. “I'd really, <em>really</em> like it if you got in touch with Shamal...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, right away. Can you move your toes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, I'm not paralyzed but I have one hell of a headache...”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Roger,”  Tia let the monitor in front of her fade from view. “We're on our own,”  She told her team. “Fate-san and Nanoha-san were defeated by Jail.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are they okay!?” Subaru gasped out, shocked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They'll be fine, right now we are to focus on rescuing Elio.” She frowned. “Why havn't we seen them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe they went inside a building?” Subaru looked around slowly. “We should have seen their footprints by now, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are we in the right area?” Caro asked suddenly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia  looked behind them, noticing that their footprints were being erased by  a sudden shift in the ground. “What in the...” Before she could finish  her statement the sand buckled upwards, creating an obvious roll in the  ground. “Everyone scatter!” The three instantly ran in opposite  directions as a giant sand worm surfaced where they had just been  standing. “It's <em>huge</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“By the light of Elune!” Subaru gasped out. “What is that thing!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A sand wyrm!” Tia shot the beast several times, drawing attention onto her. “Caro, keep going!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But-!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  said go!” Tia dodged to the side as the wyrm dived towards her and  destroyed one of the stone buildings behind her. “Find Elio!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“R-right!” Caro turned and ran off. '<em>Why did I leave without Freidliche!?</em>'</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru  ran in the sand a moment before jumping and forming her wing road along  with her skates. “Lock and load!” A single rifle shell flew out from  her glove as she charged the beast trying to get her partner.  “Divine...!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro ignored the loud explosion behind her and kept  running, eyes scanning the area. A sudden vibrating on her hands made  her look down, seeing her device glowing. '<em>Someone is summoning near by!</em>'  She turned and rounded a corner, following the feeling she was getting  from her gloves. As she continued the feeling got stronger and  eventually lead her to the edge of the dig site. A softy ripple made  the sand around her shift lightly, a sign that there was a battle  taking place on the other side. Quickly she scampered up the large dune  and laid down at the top to peek over and see what was going on. Elio  was crouched down, obviously panting hard. In front of him another  giant wyrm, posed to strike. '<em>It's him!</em>' She moved to slide down  the dune but the sight of Lutecia made her stop. The girl was finishing  her summon, seeking a swarm of locus onto the beast.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio wiped  the smear of blood off his forehead with the back of his hand and  gasped out. “Another one down... I can't do this anymore...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lutecia  fell to her knees and breathed heavily. “We have what we need, let's  escape here as soon as possible...” The wyrm they were fighting fell to  the ground, dead. “I don't think... I can do this much longer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  red head nodded and pushed himself up. “Come on,” He started to walk  over to her but the ground suddenly broke upwards, flinging both of  them in separate directions. A large red scaled creature erupted from  the ground and made a high pitched screaming noise. “Oh hell, we pissed  off their mother!” His eyes went to the side, seeing Lutecia on her  back, pushing herself away from the animal when it turned to look at  her. '<em>She's going to get eaten!</em>' His hand tightened around the spear he had. '<em>But... if she does... I'll be free and Scaglietti will lose one of his best soldiers...</em>'  His eyes went to the wyrm as it reared it's body back to strike, mouth open to reveal several rows of sharp teeth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Help me!!” Lutecia screamed out loudly. “My knight!!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  worm shot forward, lunging towards the girl. Right before it could  consume her a large gash ripped through it's scales, near the end of  it's body. Elio flew down in front of Lutecia, hovering a few inches  off the ground. Sharp angled purple armor reflected the sun's harsh  light. Elio was now clad in a black under suit with purple metal  forming boots on his feet up to his knees, where they split into double  points. After a small break, more armor covered his thighs and lead up  to a breastplate. His shoulders each held two points as well. Down his  arms the armor continued, also giving a small break at his elbow before  covering his forearms and the top of his hands. He had no helmet but  from his back two large sheer pixie wings erupted, beating quickly to  keep him in the air. The male held out his arm and opened his hand,  prompting Lutecia to slowly reach upwards and hand him Strada. Now  armed, he glared at the beast. '<em>As if I could let someone die.</em>'</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio's  body left a blur behind it as he flew forward, slashing quickly. The  beast let out another scream and fell backwards, exposing it's less  armored stomach. The knight flew towards it quickly, shooting two  cartridges from his spear. “Knight attack: Through the Never!” With a  single swipe of his spear he sent a gash ripping through the animal,  cleaving it in half. Slowly he landed after the attack and turned to  look at Lutecia, who was laying on her back. “Are you okay...?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I...  can't move...” She told him weakly. “Used too much... energy...”  Despite her weak body she couldn't help but look at him in admiration.  “You... accepted it...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can't watch someone die,” He answered, kneeling to pick her up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Give me...Strada back...” She leaned her head weakly against his shoulder. “So Jail... Won't...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  understand.” He let his spear go back into it's watch form and watched  Lutecia slowly try and attach it over her small wrist. “I guess I don't  have a choice but to go back and get that password and get you  treated...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you.” She sighed out and closed her eyes, falling asleep.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro  watched Elio jump into the air and fly away from her. The girl stayed  there on her stomach for several moments before the first tear fell off  her cheek. Soon another followed it on the other side while she stood  up in the sand of the hot desert. She let out a small sob before her  trembling hands slowly balled into fist and shook. Every so slowly she  lifted her head and glared at the spot where Elio once was. Another  tear fell from her eyes but this time held no sadness in it. Rage  ripped through her heart, tearing at everything she knew. Her knight  had been stolen from her, and she didn't like it. Not at all. She  closed her eyes tightly, shoulders shaking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Little Girl,</em>”  A voice floated to her, making Caro open her eyes once again. Snow  flared around her in all directions, covering the ground and the trees  around her. To her left a frozen pond caught her attention. “<em>What is it that you seek?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro looked up above the pond, seeing a ice blue dragon standing before her. “Power,” She answered immediately.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>For what?</em>”  The dragon asked her, stepping forward and spreading its wings to  reveal an almost transparent material to catch the wind. The snow blew  around them faster, swirling around between them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To fight,” Caro told him, eyes firm on the dragon's. “To hurt...To take back something that belongs to me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Revenge?”</em> It pondered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The dragon seemed to smile. “<em>Very well then, little girl. What is your name?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro. Caro Lu Rushie.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Princess Caro Lu Rushie. I will grant you the power you seek. Call my name, and I will come to your side.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro  opened her eyes, once again in the heat of the desert. In front of her  the ground opened up as a black demon wyrm arose. “You,” It spoke  telepathically to the girl. “My mate and children are dead! I will take  my revenge!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your revenge,” Caro spoke calmly to it, raising a  hand. “Is nothing compared to the ice in my heart.” Ignoring the loud  roaring screech of the beast, she simply opened her hand. “Shiva.” The  summoning circle appeared at once and the screech of her opponent was  drowned out by the roar of the ice dragon appearing behind her. Flaring  out her wings, Shiva took a long intake of air before breathing out  frost, scanning the area in front of her. When the blue mist faded  away, Caro was given the sight of a large block of ice where the father  of the wyrms once was. The sand was frozen as well, even glistening in  the sun's light. “Break,” She spoke, a light fog coming from her mouth.  The ice in front of her shattered instantly, raining chunks down into  the sand and sinking back into the hole it had came from. Shiva looked  at its master a moment before shrinking down to the height of four feet  and length of seven. Her wings folded onto her back and the two walked  down the other side of the dune towards Tia and Subaru who were running  at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Caro!” Subaru shouted, dropping to her knees to look at  the girl. “What happened!? Did you find Elio!?” She had blood smeared  on her cheek from the battle but seemed otherwise unhurt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,”  She told them softly, looking down and suddenly overtaken by sadness.  “He... He...” Not able to continue, she lost the rage and collapsed  into tears, hugging Subaru as tightly as she could.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia looked  over at the ice blue dragon with a confused expression. “Let's head  back...I have the feeling we have a lot to talk about...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru  nodded and picked Caro up, carrying her back to their rendezvous point.  “So... you're a new summon, huh?” She asked the Dragon, who seemed to  not be interested in her. “Um, I'm Subaru, and this is...” Her sentence  trailed off when Shiva simply spread her wings and took into the air.  “Well... not friendly like Freidliche is it?”</span></p>

Next time...
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Caro:  She has taken something from me, something I want back. My mind tells  me to be calm, to think, to think things through... But my heart hurts,  my eyes water, and I feel something I don't like at all. This  feeling... I don't want it, but its the only thing keeping me from  breaking... I don't understand... What is this...?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia: My second  mission in a row failed. I'm beginning to understand just how hard my  path to an enforcer will be, but even so... I won't give up. I will  lead my team.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru: Nanoha-san was defeated in battle. I never  thought it could happen... I've been thinking a lot lately, and I  realize now the expression “nothing is invincible”. I can't slack off  now. If my opponents become harder, then I will get stronger.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio:  Lutecia is starting to listen to me, but the information I gained for  my field trip has only lead to more questions. I have to gain more  data... and somehow get it to section six. It's disgusting but for now  I'll have to trade my power for information. Once I have enough to  bring him down, I'll make my move. Wait for me, Caro-hime.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha:  I have to become stronger... strong enough to overpower an AMF, but  how? Even my best only gave me a few seconds of power... How can I  fight Scaglietti, who uses technology to neutralize everything I am  capable of...?</span></p>
