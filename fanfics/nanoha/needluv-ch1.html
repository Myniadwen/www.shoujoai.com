<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was by  far one of the most boring times in my life. My last mission has left  both Fate and I magically drained, having been the victims of some type  of magic diminishing device. Although it was nothing new to us, Shamal  still seemed to find the need to ban us from doing anything magical  until we recovered. Fate, having never taken leave for the year, went  to visit Lindy and Arf since Chrono was there was well. I was invited  along but it was a family thing and I had decided to spend my week off  with mine. At least that was my plan. Unfortunately there was no  patrolling ship in the area close enough to transfer me to Earth after  I teleported from here. Thus I was left alone in my apartment,  forbidden to cast any magic at all. My paperwork was completed after  day one, leaving me to be even more bored than I already was. On the  third day I managed to sneak to the training ground and watch my  students beat each other up but that too came to a stop when I started  trying to teach them. Caro tattled on me and Shamal was really upset  that I had gone against her ban. Although I know Caro was only trying  to make sure I didn't hurt myself, and I'll admit that I kind of did  just a little bit, I was still irked. Now I had to wear this bracelet  that monitored my magic output. If I so much as put a toe out of line  Shamal would bite my head off.</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hayate-chaaaaaaan!”  Nanoha waved to her supervisor and even turned it into a playful salute  when she was close enough. “What are you up to? Busy tonight?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good  afternoon!” Hayate greeted her with a smile and stopped walking long  enough for her to catch up. “Tonight? I have a meeting with some  officers about budget plans and stuff, why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw. I rented a movie, was wondering if you wanted to come over and watch it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,” Hayate apologized with a light smile. “What movie was it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“300.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The one where three hundred Yuunoha-ians went up again The Legion?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm.  And the main character goes 'This! Is! Spartaaaaaaaaaaa!' and stuff,  supposed to be really good. I heard the flame war special effects were  outstanding. We can do it tomorrow night if you want?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hayate  scratched her cheek lightly. “Sorry Nanoha-chan, tomorrow night I have  to work overtime. Yuuno is supposed to come help but I don't know if  we'll get done in time or not.” After seeing the sudden sad look on her  face she tried to cheer her up. “Um, but I'm sure we can do it the day  after that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Promise?” She looked over at her with hopeful eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, promise.” Holding up her pinky the two friends shook on it.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Shamal-sensei!” Nanoha pouted at her, covering her bare chest. “Can't you hurry any? I'm freezing.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The doctor laughed happily. “You came on your own time and I scheduled you in, so don't complain. Move your hands please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha reluctantly moved her arms and allowed the doctor to place the metal piece against her chest. “Kya! That's like ice!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shhhh...”  The blond held up one finger to her lips while listening to the  heartbeat. Once satisfied she took the object from her ears and the  other piece away from Nanoha's skin. “If you didn't wait until it was  snowing outside before coming to get your yearly physical, which I  remind you is four months late, it wouldn't be so cold.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou, you're always so stubborn about this kind of thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shamal  reached out to ruffle Nanoha's hair. “Because it has to do with your  health, so I'm very persistent about it.” She could tell her friend was  blushing already so she pressed the advantage. “Standard questions now.  Do you feel sick?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hurt anywhere?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nope.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Any sudden un-explained pains in your chest area?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nuh-uh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you pregnant?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have you- whoa, <em>what!?</em>” Shamal dropped her pen and almost lost her clipboard as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I lied.” Nanoha stuck out her tongue. “You made quite a face there, I should have taken a picture.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shamal glared at her while the brown haired one laughed. “Okay fine then, I'll continue. How is your sex life?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This time Nanoha did go red. “Um, I don't exactly have one...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Any lasting pains after anal sex?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh!? I , that is, not really, I mean no, I don't-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How many times a week do you masturbate?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Once maybe- I dunno!” Nanoha felt herself burn all the way to her ears. “What kind of medical questions are these!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Their not.” Shamal informed her happily. “It was just revenge for your little joke.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“...  SHAMAL!” Nanoha puffed out her cheeks. “That's... that's mal-practice!  I could have your license revoked! Mou!” reaching over, she grabbed her  shirt and started putting it on quickly. “Honestly...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You're so cute when you blush. Ahh, to be young.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anyway,” She tried anything to get the topic of herself and her non-existent love life. “Am I in good shape?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  doctor helped her friend get into her flight jacket uniform before  answering her. “For the most part yes. I'm a little worried about you  intake though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha paused her dressing to look over at her. “My intake? Like what I eat?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm. You've gained a few pounds since your last check-up. Have you been eating alright? Stressed?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The younger girl blushed lightly. “Um... I've been a little depressed lately... I guess I've eaten more than normal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is something the matter?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nah,  I'll be alright. Just a little bout like everyone goes through. I guess  I should lay off the cake and ice cream and all those cookies and  brownies and milkshakes and-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eep...” She close one eye and gave the doctor a cute look. “I'm not really good at cooking and Fate has been busy lately so...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You've  eaten nothing but junk food the past while have you?” Crossing her  arms, Shamal tapped her foot. When Nanoha didn't defend herself  immediately she let out a sigh. “That's it, you're going on a diet. As  soon as Fate gets back I'll let her know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A diet!?” She looked shocked. “But I run and exercise and kick box and train everyday!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  gained weight because your body isn't getting the vitamins it needs and  it isn't burning calories properly, so you're going on a health food  diet, not to lose weight, but to get your body back in top form.”  Nanoha opened her mouth to complain but Shamal cut her off. “No buts.  No more sweets for you for a month.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A <em>month</em>!?” Nanoha felt like crying. “But... Yuuno just baked me a cake...”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha sighed out as she walked through the grocery store while looking at the list. '<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I can't believe this...</span></em>' Stopping she put a loaf of bread into her cart. '<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A month without any candy or cakes...I grew up in a cake shop for crying out loud, I can't deal with this</span></em>'. She had to avert her eyes when she walked past the other bakery goods on display. '<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I could so cheat on this diet and Shamal would never know...</span></em>' Despite her thoughts she had way too much respect for the woman to go against what she told her. '<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At least I can eat as many peaches as I want...</span></em>' Nanoha picked up a peach and smiled at it before gasping at the price and setting it back down. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">'Too bad they are out of season and cost so much...</span></em>'
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-san!” The voice made the woman turn around and smile at Subaru. “What a coincidence running into you here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm, shopping for dinner?” Nanoha allowed Subaru to walk next to her as they strolled the isles.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, I'm going to cook for Tia tonight. Hayate gave me permission to use the mess hall kitchen so I could.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You could have used my kitchen if you wanted, I'm home alone for the week you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah,  well,” Subaru blushed lightly and diverted her eyes. “The mess hall  kitchen is closed after a certain time and we'd be able to be alone  while cooking and...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh.” Nanoha blushed at the words. “Okay then, I understand. Have fun tonight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru held a hand to her mouth. “Hehe, tonight may be the night! I'm so excited.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  pony tailed woman smiled at her enviously a moment. Before any more  words could be said between them a small beeping sound from Raising  Heart made Nanoha raise her hand to accept the incoming video call.  “Hello,” She greeted the screen that quickly turned into an image of  Hayate. “Hayate-chan, what's up?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanoha-chan,” She began lightly with a nervous look. “Um, about tonight?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hm? I'm shopping for dinner now, will you be late?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually...” Without warning she clapped her hands in front of herself and bowed her head. “I can't make it! I'm sorry!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh!? But... But we pinky promised!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know!” The girl looked really sorry. “I just got a call from some  higher-ups, and I have to report my research to them. Yuuno is helping  me but at this rate we may not be done in time before we have to go...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou...” Nanoha's face fell. “I guess it can't be helped...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm really sorry...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't  worry, do your best 'kay?” With that, Nanoha looked up and tried her  best to smile at her friend. “Talk to you later okay?” Although her  face looked happy her voice still clearly showed how she felt. Hayate  tried to reply but Nanoha already cut off the communication. “Subaru,  I'm going to run ahead and finish shopping so I can get home before it  starts to snow, you should do the same okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah... okay...” She  looked at her teacher sadly, not really understanding what was going on  but still getting the feeling that she was upset. “Um...Bye bye.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nanoha  looked out the window sadly as she hugged the stuffed bear Fate had  given her last birthday. It was a large plushie, able to sit in her lap  and still give the girl a place to rest her chin on while cuddling it.  She had named the bear after the one who gave it to her, only spelling  it's name backwards. Fate didn't catch it at first but had blushed  happily when she realized what it was. Back on Earth there was a saying  that if you named a bear after the person who gave it to you they would  fall in love. Although they were close enough to kiss each other's  cheeks and cuddle on the couch nothing more seemed to have blossomed  from the gift. The snow was building up on the slanted glass window  slowly, cutting off the view of the dark sky. Nanoha hugged the bear  closer to herself and closed her eyes to rid herself of the depressing  view. '<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I'm lonely...</span></em>' She thought sadly to herself. '<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia and  Subaru are probably rolling in the hay right now... Caro and Elio are  playing together... Even Hayate is with someone... Why am I alone?</span></em>'  A single tear rolled down her cheek and onto the animal she held onto.  She shivered lightly, ignoring the fact that she was only in a white  button up shirt that only had the top few done and her favorite pair of  yellowish-orange panties. The throw comforter on the back of the couch  would offer her the warmth she needed but for some reason she didn't  think to pull it down over herself.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">'<em>I can't believe Shamal asked me about my love life,</em>' Her mind went on. '<em>Am I pregnant? Honestly... I'm still a virgin.</em>' Another tear fell onto the fur beneath her chin. '<em>I  don't have a boyfriend...Not even anyone to hold me. Why don't I know  what it's like to be loved? To be so happy I'm bursting like Subaru was  earlier? I can't even get my friends over here for one night, what  makes me think I'll never know what it's like to be whispered to in the  dark? To be told I'm loved repeatedly...</em>' She buried her face  against the stuffed bear and sobbed out silently. Moments ticked by  painstakingly slow for the girl as she cried, only hearing herself  sniff and breath. So absorbed in her tears, she didn't even hear the  door to her apartment open nor the sound of footsteps walking over to  the couch. She looked up, startled, when she felt a hand being placed  on her head. The girl gasped as she looked over at the woman standing  beside her. “Fate-chan? You aren't supposed to be back until tomorrow?”  Fate chose rather to sit behind her, squeezing herself between Nanoha  and the corner of their 'L' shaped couch before answering her question.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hayate  told me that you looked really upset for some reason so I came back a  day early.” Her arms looped under her friend's and wrapped lazily  across her stomach. One leg was between the couch and her friend while  the other was barely hanging on the couch, giving Nanoha a nice place  to sit. “Why are you crying?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wasn't crying,” She lied in her defense as she looked forward again so Fate wouldn't see her red cheeks and eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Etaf  says you were crying.” Fate informed her while moving the bear in the  other girl's lap so it was facing her. “He says you made the fur on his  head all damp.” To stress this point she moved the bear's arms up and  rubbed the top of it's head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Etaf is lieing to you,” With one finger she poked the stuffed animal's nose. “Don't lie, Etaf.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate  gently urged Nanoha to lean back against her and was complied almost  instantly. “Really, what's bothering you?” She watched the brown haired  girl idly play with her stuffed bear a while before trying again. “Can  I help you with anything? Stressed out maybe? Need a cookie?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  sighed. “I don't know...” Her voice faded off, choosing rather to use  her fingers and play with the object in her lap while gathering her  thoughts. “It's silly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don't mind if it's silly,” The blond urged her to go on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  stopped moving the bear's arms and leaned her head back to rest on  Fate's shoulder. “It's just that...” Her gaze looked up at the ceiling,  not really focusing on anything. “I'm lonely.” The woman behind her  repeated the last word in question so she tried to say it a little more  clearly. “Everyone is just so busy lately. Fate-chan's been gone for a  week, Hayate-chan is working insane hours with Yuuno-kun's help, Subaru  and Tia are training with each other every waking moment it seems...”  She looked back in front of herself. “Even Vita-chan is too busy to  spend time with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This hasn't ever bothered you so bad before? Why now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it's not <em>just</em> that... I can tell my Stars members are starting to fall for each  other... And on top of that, I accidentally walked in on Hayate-chan  and Yuuno-kun making out.” She heard Fate give a half surprised gasp  along with a half chuckle behind her. “It made me start thinking... I'm  almost twenty now and I've never been with anyone. Never been held in a  romantic way, never been kissed properly... I just... I don't know...  want to be <em>loved</em> you know? I just want... I want to have that  feeling, to be touched, have someone whisper in my ear.” Suddenly she  tried to force herself to laugh and shook her head. “It's not like I  can just <em>ask</em> someone to do it, not even Yuuno and he's my best  friend. I'm sorry, I'm saying such weird things. I-” Her sentence cut  off before it even began, feeling Fate's lips on her neck. The kiss was  soft, slow and even a little sensual. Another one followed it shortly  after and then a third, each one working up her exposed shoulder to her  ear. “F-Fate-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't want...” She whispered out against  Nanoha's skin, lips still close enough to brush against flesh when she  spoke. “I don't want anyone to touch Nanoha like that.” Her eyes  closed, nose gently nudging Nanoha's neck to get her to lean more to  the side. “I don't like it.” Again she kissed, this time sucking ever  so gently on the spot before pulling her lips off and moving closer to  the ear. “If you want to be loved, I want to be the one to love you.”  After reaching her goal she started to gently nibble on Nanoha's  earlobe.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sto...Stop it...” Despite her words one hand still went  up to thread through the golden locks of hair. “Fate-chan... We're both  girls...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that wrong?” She pondered as her gently nuzzled  against her and rubbed the girl's stomach in a very slow circle. “I  love you, so if you want anything, please, let me do it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But Fate-chan... I don't want you to do something just because I-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For  me-” She cut her off before the words were finished. “For me,” Fate  repeated herself once Nanoha stopped talking. “I want to as well.  Because I love you, I want to make you happy. I haven't said anything  because I didn't want to scare you. Nanoha's happiness is my happiness,  so as long as you are smiling I can smile too. If you want to feel  loved then I can honestly...” Fate hugged the girl closer. “I can love  you if you want me to...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fate-chan...” Nanoha closed her eyes  lightly. “...Thank you.” Moments passed by in silence before the  kissing resumed. Nanoha shifted ever so lightly to allow Fate more of  her exposed neck and breathed in a shaky intake of air as the hand on  her stomach started rubbing again. “ Makes me feel funny inside,” She  whispered lightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'll stop if you want me to,” Was the reply against the girl's ear. “I don't want to seduce you, I want to love you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha nodded as best she could. “I also love Fate... but I never... like this...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  want to make you happy,” Fate snuggled her. “To show you that you  aren't alone, that I will always be with you. If you want to stay just  friends then that is okay. We can pretend this never happened.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.  No, I don't want to pretend.” Nanoha placed a hand on top of Fate's.  “This is sudden but... but it's what I want... this feeling isn't like  something I've ever felt before. If it's okay with you... If it's okay  with you then it's okay with me. I don't mind what other people think;  Fate-chan is Fate-chan. I love you,” She moved her hand to run across  the blond's cheek. “I never thought of it as the kind of love I was  seeking because I was also worried... But right here, right now, my  heart is beating faster and faster. It's telling me to realize what it  is...” turning, she looked into Fate's eyes. “I'm not worried,  Fate-chan. We can love each other no matter what, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then...”  Nanoha closed her eyes slowly. “Kiss me?” Her request was fulfilled  slowly, lips pressing together in a gentle manor. “Fate...” She started  when the kiss ended, dropping the childhood honorific she had kept for  so long. “Make love to me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Together,” Her warm arms held onto her newfound lover strongly. “We'll make love together...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes...Together. Always.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  two girls exited the bathroom happily, still smiling at each other in a  shy manor. Nanoha blushed happily as her hair was lightly fluffed with  the towel taken from Fate's body and laughed and the gleeful look she  was getting. “Thank you,” Nanoha told her merrily as the hair drying  was done and moved to the bed to put on some clothes.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's still a  little early to turn in, do you want to do anything?” Fate playfully  stopped Nanoha from putting on her nightshirt and instead offered her a  blue and white pajama set from one of her bags. “I got this for you  while I was shopping.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha blushed lightly and took the gift  happily. “Thank you, it's cute.” The clothing was simple, nothing more  than a white long shirt that went to her knees with blue trim. Unlike  her other shirt it didn't have any buttons to get in the way of it,  instead having little sleeping cat patterns all over it with the word  'meow' written in random parts. The pants were draw string, having the  same pattern, and held loose around her legs but snug enough around her  waist to stay on her. “Am I a cat now?” Moving her hand over the fabric  she let out a smile. “Silk?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, I had to get it for you since  you always were that same shirt. I think it's time to let it go,  Nanoha, it has holes all in it.” Fate changed into a spaghetti strap  sheer black teddy nightgown that went only a little past her butt.  Matched with black panties with frills she was clad in her normal  sleeping attire.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe,” She started dressing herself. “But you  gave it to me so many years ago, I love it. I suppose these can replace  it, though.” Nanoha hugged herself happily. “It feels really nice and  smooth.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I'm glad you like it.” The blond walked over to Nanoha and hugged her from behind. “So, what do you want to do...Honey?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nanoha  smiled brightly, cheeks still colored. “We could watch the movie I  rented...” At that moment her stomach growled loudly. “Or... maybe a  snack or something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Popcorn, nachos, hot dogs, and a movie?”  Fate nuzzeled her cheek against her girlfriend's much like a kitten  would. “And soda. A little junk food is good every now and then I  suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nya...haha...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don't want?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do!”  Nanoha looked over her shoulder at her friend and grinned. “Might as  well go out with a bang, I am starting a diet tomorrow.” Reaching up,  she took Fate's hands from around her and held them as she walked  downstairs with her in tow. “Shamal is putting me on it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I gained a few pounds,” She pouted. “Am I fat? Is my butt big or something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fate laughed happily. “You're so cute.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou I'm serious! Am I getting chubby?” Pulling up her shirt she looked at her flat, toned stomach.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well...” Fate trailed off, scratching her cheek. “Not your stomach or your butt...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” Nanoha looked terrified. “Are my thighs big?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  but...” She gave Nanoha the most playful smile she could muster. “Your  breasts aren't as firm and perky as they were a while ago.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh!?”  Nanoha quickly peeked down her shirt. “Yes they are! They don't bounce  or anything!” Fate's sudden laughter made her look up, nose splashed  with color yet again. “Mou, don't tease me like that!”</span></p>

“Come  on, is that all you have!?” Nanoha's voice floated around her forwards  playfully as she zig-zagged around and between them. “I haven't been  here in a week and you all got this slow?” She laughed merrily as  Subaru flew next to her and twirled around Tia as well, slapping the  girl on the butt as she wizzed by. “No chance!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kya!” Tia's face turned several shades of red as she rubbed her sore bottom. “Nanoha, this isn't fair!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Life  isn't fair!” Nanoha taunted back as she cut a back flip to allow Elio  to soar under her before twisting around Caro's mad attempt to tackle  her. In mid turn she grabbed the little girl and wrapped her arms  around her playfully before singing out to the rest.  “I-have-a-hostaaaaaage!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Subaru wiped sweat from her forehead.  “All we have to do is touch her to pass this training exercise and yet  we've been doing this for almost half an hour... Does she seem  different to you guys?” Her eyes watched Caro try in vain to grab a  hold of the person gripping her from behind before finally giving up  and hanging in her arms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Elio nodded. “She doesn't seem so  serious and distant like she has been the past little while...It's like  she's dancing in the sky...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tia smirked. “Ah. And we're her dance partners. So let's give her a concert she'll never forget!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah!”  The other two agreed readily, all running forward with their weapons  drawn. The war cry rang around the battle area loudly, roaring from the  smiling mouths of the pleased students who finally had their cheerful  teacher back again.</span></p>

Author's  notes:Sorry for the long time between updating my Nanoha stories,  losing my computer and all my written works effected me more than I  thought it would and I did, indeed, stop writing for a while... A month  even. For those of you following along with updates, no, Redemption  isn't stopped. I don't think I can recover the chapter I lost when my  hard drives failed so I'm going to have to re-write it. Bear with me, I  haven't given up, and the best thing I could get right now is a little  encouragement to let me know you guys are still with me. BTW, today's  my birthday, September 19th. Also, a random fact, this was originally  going to be a 'lemon' fanfic rated 'M' but I cut it all out and decided  to post it as-is.
