<h1>Preparations</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../trigun/index.html">Trigun</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jubei.html">Jubei</a><br> </h2>
<pre>In an apartment in a desert town, a young woman is setting the dinner 
table for two.But Meryl has more on her mind than just supper, her 
love, the man to whom she&#39;s given her heart, Vash the Stampede, has 
been gone for the last two weeks. Two weeks gone since Vash went to 
confront his brother, Knives.

&quot;What is taking him so long, she thinks, maybe he&#39;s still tracking 
Knives, maybe he&#39;s not coming back, maybe he&#39;s...?!&quot;

Just then, the raven-haired woman&#39;s thoughts were interrupted. The 
bathroom door opened, steam billowed out the doorway as a large figure 
walked out.

&quot;Wow, nothing beats the end of a long day&#39;s work like a good bath,&quot; 
said Millie, who walked out in nothing but her bathrobe.

Meryl soon collected herself.

&quot;What am I thinking, why wouldn&#39;t he come back, he&#39;s too good to get 
killed, she thought, a little weird, but he&#39;s too good...and real nice 
too.&quot;

&quot;Ooo,&quot; Millie squealed, &quot;this looks great, Meryl!&quot;

Meryl always thought Millie was a little dense, but she certainly 
appreciated good food. Meryl was still sulking when Millie spoke up.

&quot;Hey, what&#39;s wrong Meryl?&quot; Millie asked.

Meryl looked up a Millie, and before she could speak...

&quot;You&#39;re thinking about Mr. Vash, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Meryl answered, sighing heavily.

&quot;Well don&#39;t worry Meryl, Vash is gonna come back, and you two will 
finally get to be together!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right Millie, Meryl retorted, then I&#39;m gonna show him how 
much of a woman I am!&quot;

Millie stared at her blankly.

&quot;What?&quot; Meryl snapped.

&quot;Nothing,&quot; Millie replied.

&quot;Yeah right, you just gave me a look like I said the sky was falling 
down!&quot;

Millie sat silent for a moment and then...

&quot;How long have we known each other Meryl?&quot;

&quot;I dunno, about five years, maybe.&quot;

&quot;Seven actually.&quot;

&quot;Okay, seven, what&#39;s your point?&quot;

&quot;Well, in the seven years we&#39;ve known each other, I...I...I&#39;ve...&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never seen you in any kind of date or relationship,&quot; Millie 
rapidly exclaimed.

Meryl was taken aback by what her friend just said.

&quot;Are you saying I&#39;m not gonna know what to do with Vash?!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m saying, considering that he&#39;s lived for over a century, chances 
are he&#39;s gonna notice your nervousness.&quot;

Meryl&#39;s face was red with a combination of anger and embarrassment. She 
stormed away from the table and grabbed her bathrobe.

&quot;I&#39;m taking my bath and then I&#39;m going to bed.&quot;

The bathroom door slammed shut, Millie could only let out a sigh in 
response.

Ten minutes later...

Meryl was soaking in the tub, her mind racing.

&quot;That Millie, ugh, where does she get off saying I don&#39;t know how to 
please a man?&quot;

She looked up to the ceiling and sighed.

&quot;Then again, Vash has probably had some experience, but I have had 
some...a little...zilch, what am I gonna do?&quot;

As Meryl climbed out of the bathtub, she felt a cold wind go up her 
body, which perked up her already wet nipples. She relized that while 
the desert can get scorching during the day, at night it can be like a 
frozen tundra. She put on her bathrobe and then she opened the door. 
Meryl peered into the darkened apartment, which was slightly 
illuminated by a few candles. She could see a figure walk towards the 
nightstand, then turn and walk towards her. As the silhouette cam 
closer, the form of Millie began to appear. She was still in her 
bathrobe, but it was opened slightly, revealing the valley between her 
breasts.

&quot;Millie, wha...?&quot; Meryl started to say.

&quot;Meryl,&quot; Millie interrupted, &quot;I think I can help you, you want to know 
Vash&#39;s body, right?&quot;

Meryl nodded her head.

&quot;Well, I think that you should know your own body first, before you 
learn his.&quot;

Millie&#39;s towering form now stood in front of the petite Meryl. Millie 
placed her hands on the smaller girl&#39;s shoulders and brought her face 
down to hers.

&quot;I can help you Meryl, but if you&#39;re afraid to try, we don&#39;t have to do 
this.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not afraid.&quot;

&quot;So you want to know Vash&#39;s body, to show him that you are all the 
woman he&#39;ll ever need?&quot;

&quot;Y-y-yes.&quot;

With that said, Millie moved her face closer to Meryl&#39;s, giving her the 
first kiss of the night. Millie&#39;s tongue parted her friend&#39;s lips and 
danced a tango of passion with her friend&#39;s tongue. Meryl was surprised 
and confused by the moment, more so because she was enjoying the 
passion her friend was giving her. Meryl soon felt Millie&#39;s hands move 
the fabric of her bathrobe from her shoulders. She felt the fabric move 
off her body and heard it hit the floor. Instantly, she found herself 
wrapping her arms around her taller friend, pressing her nude body into 
Millie&#39;s and pressing herself deeper into the kiss. Millie then pulled 
away and stared into her friend&#39;s big, blue eyes. She then led Meryl to 
the bed...

&quot;Lay down on your stomach.&quot;

Meryl did as she was instructed, streching herself out on the bed. 
Millie then took a bottle off the nightstand.

&quot;This is body lotion, it&#39;ll feel really good.&quot;

She poured some into her hand and then proceeded to rub the lotion onto 
Meryl. Meryl trembled a little from her friend&#39;s loving touch, but 
began to relax a little as the rubbing began to feel better and better. 
Millie continued to rub the lotion into her friend&#39;s leg, and then 
moved towards Meryl&#39;s nether regions and began to blow a hot breath 
into it and into the crevice of her rear. Meryl was startled, but at 
the same time, beginning to feel aroused. Millie then started to 
massage Meryl&#39;s rear and her lower back, and repositioned herself over 
her friend&#39;s body. Meryl could no longer feel her friend&#39;s hands on her 
body, but felt them on her shoulders and Millie&#39;s bare breasts pressed 
aganist her back.

Millie started to kiss Meryl&#39;s neck and shoulders, and then made her 
way to her earlobe. After kissing it for a few seconds, Millie 
whispered, &quot;Turn over.&quot;

Meryl moved her body around, all the while Millie kissing her neck as 
she turned. Then, Meryl and Millie were finally face to face, their 
aroused nipples and breasts pressed aganist each other. Millie rubbed 
her nose slightly aganist Meryl&#39;s and then went in for another 
passion-filled kiss. Her tongue parted Meryl&#39;s lips and met tongue once 
more, but this time, Meryl&#39;s tongue met Millie&#39;s with just as much 
passion. As Millie attempted to pull away, Meryl arched her body closer 
to meet Millie&#39;s warm, soft flesh.

Millie finally broke the kiss and turned her attention to Meryl&#39;s 
aroused nipples. She softly licked the edge of Meryl&#39;s nipple, sending 
a shock of pleasure through the petite girl&#39;s chest. Millie played with 
Meryl&#39;s nipple with her tongue, teasing her, before closing her warm 
mouth completely over the nipple. Meryl moaned with pleasure as Millie 
continued to suckle at her breast. Millie then released the nipple, 
turning her attention to its twin, giving it the same treatment.

Meryl was feeling the pleasure, but Millie was beginning to come to her 
end. She pulled Meryl into her lap and positioned her pelvis just under 
her friend&#39;s and began grinding aganist it in a clockwork motion. Meryl 
soon joined in the motion, finally starting to pleasure her friend. 
Millie then finally moaned out her climax.

&quot;Are...are you ok, Millie?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m fine, I just felt my end, but I&#39;m not done with you yet.&quot;

Millie then repositioned Meryl back on the bed, both women stared back 
at each other, examining the other&#39;s sweat covered bodies, glistening 
with wet beauty. Millie moved towards Meryl&#39;s stomach, licking it down 
with her tongue until she came to her navel. Millie stuck her tongue 
into the small opening and whipped it around inside. Meryl shrieked and 
giggled a little from the motion until Millie pulled away. Then, Millie 
spied her prize, Meryl&#39;s womanhood was dripping with honey from all the 
pleasure. Millie stuck two fingers into her friend and wiggled them 
around. Meryl felt as though she was going to explode. Millie then 
pulled out her fingers, licked off the honey that coated them, and 
proceeded to penetrate her tongue into her friend&#39;s nether regions. 
Meryl winnced and moaned as her friend&#39;s tongue moved up, down, and 
around her insides. Meryl felt it even deeper as Millie began to suck 
on her clitoris.

The reaction became sharper as Millie suckled on the nerve ending, she 
then turned her attention to Meryl&#39;s overflowing cup and went right 
back to work. Meryl bucked and moaned from all the pleasure, pushing 
her friend&#39;s head deeper into her. Millie could feel that Meryl was 
coming to her climax.

&quot;Maybe I should leave this for him, she thought, then again, he won&#39;t 
mind.&quot;

Millie put everything into one, big, last swirl of her tongue, and 
witnessed as her friend finally climaxed. Millie removed her face from 
her friend&#39;s nether region, and looked upon Meryl&#39;s serene and 
pleasured face.

&quot;How was that?&quot;

&quot;Hey...Millie...can I...do...that...to you?&quot;

Millie giggled, and throughout the night the sounds of love, rubbing, 
licking, kissing, moaning, could be heard in the apartment, until they 
fell asleep. The two women lay on the bed with no blanket, their hot, 
sweat-drenched bodies being cooled by the night air. With a passionate 
goodnight kiss, they fell asleep, with Meryl resting her head on her 
friend&#39;s chest.

The next morning, Meryl and Millie stood together on the front porch, 
coffee cups in hand, staring at each other, cherishing the lessons of 
passion of last night. Just then, Meryl turned to the horizion, only to 
see a tall figure heading their way.

&quot;Vash!&quot;

Meryl jumped the porch rail and raced to meet Vash the Stampede. Millie 
looked on with joy as Vash and Meryl met in a long, hard embrace.

&quot;Welcome back, Vash,&quot; Meryl whispered, &quot;welcome back.&quot;

I have to admit that I did take some influence for this story from 
Yuri&#39;s Rurouni Kenshin fanfic &quot;Awakenings.&quot; But if you read it you can 
see how different the two stories are. All I can say is, a good writer 
knows a good story when they see it.</pre>
