<h1>Another Journey, Another Story (part 17 of 24)</h1>

<a href="../gallforce/another-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>&#39;I wonder how long it&#39;ll be before I stop getting
lost?&#39; Toki thought, the lanky, red haired ensign
frowning as she walked back to a junction.

Compared to the underground shelter Toki and her
fellow ensigns had spent the last few years in the
Lady Grace was vast, and Toki hadn&#39;t quite gotten the
hang of finding her way around. Guiltily she took her
personal reader out and consulted the map she had
stored there. Realizing where she had gotten turned
around she retraced her steps, soon arriving at her
new station.

The doors to Sickbay slid open smoothly as Toki
entered, the typical sent of antiseptic solutions and
medications washing over her. Like all good Sickbays
the place was nearly spotlessly clean, the monitoring
beds spaced out along the walls, the trays of
equipment locked down in case the ship needed to
perform any sudden movement.

From the office in the rear a tall, blonde
Lieutenant-commander emerged, wearing the insignia of
the medical division, a white lab coat over top. Her
smile was gently welcoming as she approached, &quot;Welcome
Ensign Toki.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Toki saluted reflexedly, her smile a little
nervous.

Meris rubbed at her eyes, her expression tired. &quot;You
have no idea how glad I am to see you,&quot; she said,
&quot;we&#39;ve been badly shorthanded.&quot; She took a small file
reader from her pocket and called up the data, &quot;You
were a nursing assistant previously?&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Toki agreed before adding, &quot;and I was
the sole medical personnel that we had in the shelter,
too.&quot;

&quot;So you were doing whatever emergency work was
required,&quot; Meris gave her a wry smile, &quot;I know how
that feels.&quot; She set the file down, &quot;I&#39;ll run you
through the equipment here, then we&#39;ll talk about how
fast you may end up being promoted.&quot;

Toki felt herself smiling at the gentle woman&#39;s
manner, &quot;Right.&quot;

The next few hours were surprisingly enjoyable for
her, Lieutenant-commander Meris clearly knowing what
she was doing as she ran through the various pieces of
equipment and supplies in the facility. Toki was more
than pleasantly surprised by how well stocked the
facility was, the variety of injuries, illnesses and
situations that the place could handle.

&quot;That reminds me,&quot; Meris collected a small bottle of
pills from a shelf and then she passed it over to
Toki.

Toki looked over the nutritional supplement in
confusion then she looked over at Meris and
tentatively asked, &quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be passing these out to everyone who was down in
the shelter,&quot; Meris said to her in explanation, &quot;you
did a remarkable job keeping an eye on all them, but
most of you were suffering from low-grade
malnutrition.&quot;

&quot;I thought so,&quot; Toki nodded glumly, &quot;I guess it wasn&#39;t
planned that a crew would live on emergency rations
for so long.&quot;

&quot;The rats,&quot; Meris used the common and disdainful
nickname for standard emergency rations, &quot;are pretty
well balanced nutritionally, but the designers also
figured that the crew would be able to forage for
additional food.&quot; She shrugged slightly, &quot;Under the
circumstances you are all lucky you&#39;re as healthy as
you are.&quot;


&quot;Thank you ma&#39;am,&quot; Toki nodded. She looked at the
bottles, &quot;Did you want me to help distribute the
supplements to the rest of the ensigns?&quot;

Meris hesitated, &quot;How are you at getting around the
ship?&quot;

Toki felt herself blush faintly as she confessed, &quot;Not
that good, just yet.&quot;

Meris chuckled softly, but not in a mocking way. &quot;Then
I think we&#39;ll just pass them out as your fellows come
in for their second appointments,&quot; she said
cheerfully.

&quot;Very good idea,&quot; Toki agreed.

Meris checked the time and then smiled at the young
woman as she handed her the file papers, &quot;You&#39;ve got
an hour or so left in your shift... I haven&#39;t entered
all the data for the newcomers yet, could you do that
while I attend to my paperwork?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do my best,&quot; Toki bowed then settled down at one
of the stations and went to work, efficiently entering
information into the data banks.

Meris went into her office in the back of sickbay and
activated her personal computer, updating her personal
notes... she was maintaining medical and psychological
files on the command staff, as well as monitoring
several ongoing health issues. While so far the
Grace&#39;s crew were healthy, the stress of their running
fight with the Paranoid along with their limited
supplies meant that they would need careful
monitoring.

The files blurred in front of Meris&#39; eyes and she
cursed to herself softly, careful not to let her new
assistant hear. She was having a hard time
concentrating on her work, and she knew the exact
reason why: Jame&#39;s date with Chief Karin. She had
heard about it through the grapevine earlier that day,
the dinner the two women had shared and had been
surprised at how upset she had become.

&#39;It&#39;s not like I had any claim on her,&#39; Meris reminded
herself firmly. In fact Jame had turned her down
several times, the young lady uninterested in her
romantic overtures. &#39;And being stubborn I just chased
her harder,&#39; Meris thought glumly.

Not that any of the rumors said that Jame and Karin&#39;s
dinner had been all that romantic, exactly, but the
few times that Meris had seen them together she had
gotten a distinct vibe from Karin towards Jame... The
woman was clearly interested in Jame, even though the
younger woman was largely unaware of it.

Ra-rumb!

Meris blinked as the ship shuddered slightly, then she
realized what it was. The Engineers were moving the
Star Destroyer power core from the shuttle bay down to
engineering, a difficult process considering they
couldn&#39;t take the ship out of hyperspace. Instead they
were having to carefully remove deck planting and
conduits, move the Core through the section, then
repair the damage behind them.

&#39;It&#39;s a lot like surgery,&#39; Meris noted tiredly as she
tried to get back to work, &#39;cutting into the patient,
repairing the damage, then cleaning up on the way
out.&#39;

Not long after the main door swished open and the
sound of cursing followed, rather graphic too. &quot;Please
sit on a examination couch,&quot; Toki was crisply
professional, &quot;I&#39;ll get the doctor.&quot;

Meris was out of her office in a moment, blinking in
surprise as she recognized Davies from engineering,
the sandy haired woman&#39;s arm in a improvised sling.
&quot;Hi Doc,&quot; Davies sighed.

Meris moved to Davies side even as she nodded, &quot;Good
afternoon.&quot; Gently she eased the arm from the sling
even as she asked, &quot;What happened?&quot;

Davies winced as Meris gently went over her arm,
checking it gently until Davies&#39; face showed the
strain. &quot;We were shifting a section of plating when a
magnetic clamp gave way,&quot; she explained, &quot;I took a
bump to the shoulder when it hit me.&quot;

Taking a hand scanner Meris ran it over the arm even
as she murmured, &quot;Must of hurt.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Davies winced.

Meris checked the data, feeling a flash of relief. &quot;No
break,&quot; she reported, &quot;I suspect you&#39;ve torn muscles
and bruised it pretty badly, though.&quot;

&quot;Certainly feels that way,&quot; Davies flashed her a
charming smile, &quot;but I&#39;m sure you can make me feel
much better.&quot;

Meris chuckled, knowing Davies reputation as a flirt.
&quot;Save your charm,&quot; she advised, picking up a injector
from a nearby table. She pressed it to the wrist even
as she explained,. &quot;This will promote faster healing
of broken blood vessels and reduce the swelling.&quot;

&quot;And the pain?&quot; Davies winced as she slid her arm back
into the sling.

&quot;I thought big, tough engineers could take it,&quot; Meris
teased.

Davies rolled her eyes, &quot;An exaggeration, I assure
you.&quot;

Meris took down a small pouch of pain-tabs and handed
them to Davies. &quot;This should help,&quot; she said then
added seriously, &quot;but I would recommend no heavy work
for at least a day, please. You need to give your arm
time to heal.&quot;

&quot;Can I supervise the other engineers?&quot; Davies asked
with a sigh.

&quot;As long as you don&#39;t try to help, yes,&quot; Meris said
firmly.

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Davies saluted with her good hand as she
turned to go.

&quot;Is she always that much of a flirt?&#39; Toki asked as
she put the instruments away.

Meris chuckled, feeling oddly cheerful. &quot;You have no
idea,&quot; she agreed.</pre>
