<h1>Another Journey, Another Story (part 20 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gallforce/index.html">Gall Force</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gallforce/another-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>It was a sensation that was difficult to describe, the
rough twisting in the gut that the crew experienced as
the ship dropped back into normal space. One moment
they were traveling along at speeds that would have
boggled their ancestors minds, then they were back
under the regular rules of physics and poking along at
well below lightspeed.

&quot;Full sensor sweep engaged,&quot; Lieutenant Danielle
reported coolly, the black haired tactical officer
handling her job with her usual efficiency.

&quot;Bring us forward slow,&quot; Captain Gail ordered softly,
studying the image of a green, lush world in the
viewscreen. The redhead drank from her cup of steaming
soup thoughtfully, keeping her expression carefully
blank.

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Lauren responded, the slim blonde
reaching out to touch a control. The Lady Grace cut
through the void, moving from the edge of the solar
system inbound toward the inner world that was their
ultimate destination.

&quot;No broadcasts on either Solonoid or Paranoid
frequencies,&quot; Catty noted as they moved forward, &quot;only
usual cosmic background noise.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Allaine nodded formally, covertly
studying the android from the corner of her eye. The
tall, brown haired second officer was still getting
used to Catty being on the bridge, much less the
subtle shift in her personality. &#39;I&#39;m sort of glad
Lieutenant-Commander Sara is covering our evening
watch,&#39; she mused, knowing how much the newcomer
distrusted Catty.

&quot;Think we should try a long range sensor sweep on the
planet?&quot; Gail asked softly, looking at the slowly
growing planet on the screen.

&quot;It&#39;d be a gamble,&quot; Allaine answered equally softly,
&quot;if there are Paranoid vessels in the system it would
light us up for them instantly.&quot;

Gail smiled faintly, &quot;In other words I&#39;d best be
patient.&quot;

Allaine shrugged slightly, &quot;Precisely.&quot;

The fighter wings reported readiness to launch, then
engineering reported from the main shuttle bay. &quot;We&#39;re
ready for a fast drop,&quot; Davies said in her confident
manner, the sandy haired woman&#39;s face smudged with
grease, &quot;just give the word.&quot;

Karin, sadly, was stuck abed, on doctors orders.
Despite the generally good conditions aboard the Lady
the engineer had managed to come down with a bug, and
her stubborn attempt to deal with it herself had just
worsened the situation. Until she shook it she was
confined to quarters, mostly to keep it from spreading
to anyone else.

&quot;Is the latest rumor true?&quot; Gail asked with a faint
smile.

&quot;Apparently Jame is playing nurse,&quot; Allaine confirmed
with a impish smile, &quot;I think Karin is in good hands.&quot;

From the sciences station the chief medical officer
Meris kept an eye on the powerful sensors that were
slaved to her station, the tall, beautiful blonde
looking as crisp and neat as usual. Despite rumors of
her spotty background the crew had grown to trust her,
and she worked hard to live up to it. &quot;I can&#39;t be
certain at this range,&quot; she cautioned, &quot;but I am
picking up lifeforms consistent with Solonoid style
terraforming.&quot;

&quot;Do you think...?&quot; Lauren started excitedly, turning
around in her chair a moment to look expectantly at
her commanders.

Silently Gail wished that Meris had not said what she
did, seeing hope lighting up the faces of several of
the women on the bridge. &quot;Remember that we&#39;re still
deep in Paranoid territory,&quot; she reminded her people
crisply as she continued, &quot;the odds that there could
be a surviving Solenoid colony here are slim to none.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Lauren sounded much more subdued as she
turned to her board and focused on the task ahead.

&quot;Any sign of cloaked ships?&quot; Allaine asked quietly.

Meris surprised them by speaking up, &quot;I&#39;m watching for
any gravitational anomalies or energy signatures,
relaying anything I see to tactical.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s nothing so far,&quot; Danielle agreed with that.
She frowned, studying her board as she reported,
&quot;Sensors are starting to get further readings from the
planet but I&#39;m not picking up active power
signatures.&quot;

&quot;Can we get visuals of the surface?&quot; Gail asked
intently.

Danielle ran through her board, shifting a exterior
telescope for astronomical observation and training it
on the planet. As a blurry image of rough green
appeared on the screen she frowned, &quot;I&#39;ll try to
refine the image.&quot;

Furry blotches of green slowly resolved to the image
of tree tops, a great forest that seemed to blanket
the land. The image panned across the sea of pure,
lush vegetation, unbroken by any trace of habitation,
no sign of the Solenoid colonist whom records said had
come here centuries ago.

&quot;There is rubble underneath the tree coverage,&quot; Meris
reported the grim facts softly, &quot;but no other signs of
any civilization. My sensors aren&#39;t powerful enough to
penetrate the surface at this distance, however.&quot;

Gail and Allaine exchanged a glance, communicating
silently. &quot;I think we can risk using a short, high
powered sensor sweep,&quot; Allaine said.

Jumping at the chance Danielle brought the more
powerful military sensors on line and hit the planet
growing on their view screen with a full scan burst.
Data scrolled by beside the planet&#39;s image on the
screen as the computers soaked up and processed the
data, then a small, complicated diagram appeared on
the corner of the screen.

&quot;There were underground facilities,&quot; Gail pointed to a
section marked with red splotches,&quot; but they&#39;re off
line, according to the scans a long time.&quot;

&quot;If the computer&#39;s estimate is right the planet has
been abandoned well over a hundred years,&quot; Catty noted
calmly.

&quot;Were the facilities sealed?&quot; Davies asked from where
she was waiting in the shuttle bay. &quot;There could still
be salvageable tech down there,&quot; she said hopefully.

&quot;Sensors say no,&quot; Danielle said with regret, &quot;bio
signatures show that surface life in inside the
underground facilities, too.&quot; There were a long few
minutes of silence as they cut through space, the
world growing swiftly until it filled a third of the
main screen.

&quot;Are there Paranoid life signs down there?&quot; Allaine
asked, her expression oddly thoughtful. It was clear
she was thinking about something, but what exactly was
unknown.

&quot;No ma&#39;am,&quot; Meris confirmed.

&quot;We aren&#39;t detecting any Paranoid mechs either,&quot;
Danielle added for completeness, &quot;or signs of their
constructs.&quot;

&quot;What are you thinking?&quot; Gail murmured to her second
quietly.

&quot;Just that while rations are nice, fresh food would be
even better,&quot; Allaine answered softly. Raising her
voice to Meris she asked, &quot;Are there standard Solonoid
fruit trees, vegetables and range animals down there?&quot;

&quot;Yes and in abundance south of the planets equator,&quot;
Meris confirmed. Her lips quirked up in a smile,
&quot;While our rations are balanced, fresh foods help
maintain morale, too.&quot;

&quot;You too, Meris?&quot; Gail smiled faintly. She sat up,
straightening her shoulders, &quot;All right, we&#39;ll send
teams to the surface but I want security detachments
with them, too. We&#39;re also deploying the fighter wings
to patrol space around the planet, if anything odd
comes up we&#39;re bugging out.&quot;

The ship gently rumbled a few moments later as the
fighters deployed, sweeping space around the planet
while remaining in constant contact with each other
and the Lady Grace. Even if the enemy silenced a
fighter it&#39;s very absence from the sensor web would
serve as a warning, telling them that it was time to
pull out.

&quot;Request permission to join a foraging team,&quot; Danielle
stood, saluting crisply.

&quot;Denied,&quot; Gail said with some reluctance, &quot;you went
planetside last time. But pick out a few of your best
for the security teams, please.&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Danielle saluted, her face faintly
disappointed.

&quot;Meanie,&quot; Allaine teased. With a degree of amusement
in her eyes she asked, &quot;Would you mind if I went
down?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re serious?&quot; Gail blinked. &quot;Sure,&quot; she nodded,
&quot;but keep a personal communicator on you, too. If
there is trouble I want to know immediately.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Allaine nodded, striding off the bridge
with a sure step.

Gail turned to look at the planet, silently hoping
that everything went well. &#39;We have a few days lead on
the Paranoid who were chasing us,&#39; she reminded
herself, &#39;we have time.&#39; A moment&#39;s pause and she
added, &#39;I hope.&#39;</pre>
