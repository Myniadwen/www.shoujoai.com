<h1>Another Journey, Another Story (part 14 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gallforce/index.html">Gall Force</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gallforce/another-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Lieutenant-Commander Meris stood waiting by the
shuttle hatch as the tall blonde helped the survivors
of the devastated world on to the cruiser&#39;s deck,
looking them over with an expert eye. &#39;The injuries
are all remarkably mild,&#39; she mused as she supported a
girl&#39;s arm with surprising delicacy, &#39;though I&#39;m going
to have to inoculate them all against radiation
poisoning, just in case.&#39;

&quot;Say hello to the newcomers,&quot; Lieutenant Danielle said
softly from her position nearby, &quot;Ensigns Rei, Hari,
Rakka, Pat, Lea, Toki, Janni, Fay and Susan.&quot; She
paused, &quot;And Lieutenant-commander Sara.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Sara swiftly saluted the doctor, the golden
haired temporary commander of the underground shelter
swaying tiredly.

Meris narrowed her eyes, &quot;You need to get to sickbay
along with the rest of your crew, we&#39;ll examine you
there....&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Sara shook her head firmly, &quot;I have to give my
report to the captain, first.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll escort her up,&quot; Danielle looked up as another
figure emerged, this one held in restraints, &quot;along
with her.&quot;

&quot;Catty?&quot; Meris blinked, looking at the emergency
restraints that had been used to secure the young
woman&#39;s arms.

&quot;You&#39;ll hear about it from the Captain later,&quot;
Danielle added as the black haired officer led the two
of them to the lifts.

Over in another section of the shuttle bay
Lieutenant-Commander Karin oversaw the unloading of
the supplies, her eyes nearly twinkling as she went
over the list. &quot;Looks like that damaged targeting
computer will finally get replaced,&quot; the engineer ran
a hand through her dark hair, &quot;and we&#39;ll finally get
the internal emergency systems back up.&quot;

&quot;Where do you want the power suits unloaded?&quot; Jame
yelled, awkwardly trying to get a sweaty strand of
green hair up out of her eyes as she maneuvered the
heavy machinery around with magnetic clamps and
floaters.

&quot;We&#39;ll be shuffling that down to the armory, just let
Tanya and Danielle handle it,&quot; Karin answered crisply.
She looked around a moment then shouted,. &quot;Davies!&quot;

&quot;Yo!&quot; the sandy haired young woman almost seemed to
pop up out from the back of another one of the
shuttles.

&quot;I want you to start drawing proposals up for how much
damage we&#39;re going to have to do getting the Star
Destroyer power core down to engineering,&quot; Karin said
crisply, &quot;we&#39;re going to have to run them all by the
Captain before we start something this big.&quot;

&quot;Too bad we can&#39;t just re-enter normal space and use a
shuttle to bring it around the outside of the ship,&quot;
Davies murmured as she studied a ship&#39;s schematic on
her data pad.

&quot;We don&#39;t have much of a lead on the Paranoid,&quot; Karin
shrugged, &quot;I doubt the boss wants to add any extra
delays.&quot;

&quot;And moving it outside the ship while we&#39;re still in
hyperspace is completely out of the question,&quot; Davies
added glumly.

&quot;Not unless you want to have a really nice funeral,&quot;
Karin said dryly in reply. Leaving a vessel while it
was traveling in hyperspace was suicide, either
instantly destroying you or just leaving you lost in
an infinite unearthly void.

Karin left her second in command to her duties and
turned to talk to Jame only to freeze. That little
redhead Jame liked was talking to her, gazing up as
Jame worked. &quot;Is this much harder than when you were
in environmental?&quot; Katrine asked.

&quot;Actually I like it,&quot; Jame admitted as she shifted
another heavy box of equipment, &quot;the work is
interesting and I get along well with the Chief.&quot;

&quot;I had heard that Chief Karin was a real hard ass,&quot;
Katrine confided softly.

Karin stiffened, fighting back a stab of anger. &#39;Why
that little...&#39; she thought irritably, ready to move
forward and give the girl a lecture.

&quot;Then you heard wrong,&quot; Jame actually sounded angry as
she continued on, &quot;the Chief has been nothing but kind
to me, not to mention remarkably patient with someone
who has almost no real engineering experience.&quot;

&quot;You haven&#39;t heard all the stories...&quot; Katrine
continued.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Jame startled her friend by cutting her
off right in mid-sentence, &quot;but I have to get back to
work, now.&quot;

&#39;Well I&#39;ll be damned,&#39; Karin thought as she watched
Katrine walk away, &#39;seems our little Jame has fangs
when she needs them.&#39;

The lift doors opened into a hallway as Danielle led
them all out, the tactical officer explaining, &quot;The
Captain and Commander want to talk to you privately
first, before passing any of the information on to the
crew at large.&quot;

&quot;Understandable,&quot; Sara nodded, walking along while
keeping her distance from Catty.

&quot;And my own situation will have to be handled with
some delicacy,&quot; Catty remarked, the purple haired
android following peacefully.

&quot;True enough,&quot; Danielle acknowledged. They reached the
Captain&#39;s ready room and the door swiftly slid aside,
the tactical officer waving the two of them inside
first.

Captain Gail looked up from where she was talking
quietly to Commander Allaine and studied Sara
thoughtfully a moment. &quot;Welcome aboard the Lady
Grace,&quot; she got up to offer her hand, shaking the
other officer&#39;s hand firmly.

&quot;Captain,&quot; Sara smiled back as she continued on with a
tired sigh, &quot;you have no idea how good it is to see
you, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;I think I can imagine,&quot; Gail admitted as she waved
them to seats.

&quot;I&#39;ll stand, I think,&quot; Sara shook her head. With a
determined expression she gave her report, summarizing
the devastating attack on the planet, how her and her
team were stranded there in the underground command
center and the year or so that they had struggled to
survive there.

Allaine frowned slightly as she studied Sara, seeing
the exhaustion that had seemed to soak into the
younger woman&#39;s very bones. &#39;Riding herd over a crew
of just ensigns must have been hell,&#39; she thought
admiringly.

&quot;May I ask,&quot; Sara looked over at Catty with an
expression of pure loathing on her face, &quot;what you
intend to do with it?&quot;

&quot;Confinement for the rest of the voyage?&quot; Danielle
spoke up to offer that suggestion.

&quot;Not unreasonable,&quot; Catty offered, &quot;but I would
request a military trial.&quot;

There was a moment of dead silence. Gail looked at her
thoughtfully, &quot;As a military officer, you have the
right, but I&#39;m not sure how that applies to an
artificial entity.&quot;

&quot;A thing like that,&quot; Sara sounded furious, &quot;got at
least two of my crew killed, attempting to let in
Paranoid scout crews to our shelter. Destroy it before
it betrays you, too.&quot;

&quot;The other Catty was merely following her
programming,&quot; Catty responded calmly.

&quot;What exactly is that programming?&quot; Allaine asked
perceptively.

&quot;As dictated by the Solenoid high command,&quot; Catty said
crisply, &quot;I was programmed to facilitate any attempts
by Paranoid representatives to achieve a bio-merger
with Solenoid subjects.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no way our own commanders would...&quot; Sara
started.

Gail held up a hand to silence her. &quot;Why were these
commands issued?&quot; she asked Catty.

&quot;According to projections on both sides,&quot; Catty
replied emotionlessly, &quot;if the war continues in it&#39;s
present rate both species will be extinct within two
years, three at best. Negotiation proved futile, we&#39;re
simply too different, so the merger project was
initiated to attempt to create an intermediary species
to bridge the gap between us.&quot;

&quot;So why aren&#39;t you trying to help the Paranoid?&quot; Sara
challenged.

&quot;Those projections did not consider the possibility of
unaccounted for Solenoid forces like the colony ships
we&#39;re seeking,&quot; Catty answered, &quot;if they could be
brought into the war they could entirely shift the
balance of power.&quot;

&quot;Lost Colony ships?&quot; Sara blinked in confusion,
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a long story,&quot; Gail answered as she began to
explain.</pre>
