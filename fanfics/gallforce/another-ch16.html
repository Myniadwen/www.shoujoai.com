<h1>Another Journey, Another Story (part 16 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gallforce/index.html">Gall Force</a>

<a href="../gallforce/another-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>      Catty sat in the center seat in the computer room, the
purple haired communication officer&#39;s expression even more blank
than usual. A cable went from a hidden port beneath her ear to the
computer terminals, screens at three of the terminals covered with
programming code.

      &quot;You know,&quot; Karin sighed, the black haired engineer rubbing
at her eyes tiredly, &quot;this may take even longer than I thought.&quot;

      Davies looked up from her own terminal, giving her boss a
wry smile. &quot;And to think, we&#39;ve been at it two days and have barely
ran through a third of her operating system,&quot; the sandy haired woman
commented.

      Allaine looked mildly apologetic as she said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I
haven&#39;t been more help, but my bridge duties....&quot; The dark brown
haired commander shrugged slightly, running a hand tiredly through
her short hair.

      &quot;It&#39;s understandable,&quot; Karin flashed her a smile, &quot;you&#39;re
busier than any of us, working with Sara to incorporate the
newcomers into the crew.&quot;

      A chime announced there was someone at the computer room&#39;s
door, then Jame entered carrying a loaded tray. &quot;I thought you could
use a break,&quot; she smiled, the green haired woman putting down food
and drinks for them safely away from the terminals and electronics.

      &quot;Great timing,&quot; Davies got up to get a glass, drinking down
the stimulant happily then grabbing one of the sandwiches.

      &quot;Thanks,&quot; a smiling Karin grabbed another sandwich
absentmindedly and took a bite while studying another page of code,
then she blinked in surprise. &quot;My favorite,&quot; she looked up at Jame
curiously, &quot;how did you know?&quot;

      Jame felt herself blushing slightly, &quot;You usually have
someone grab that for lunch, so....&quot; She looked at the statue still
form of Catty and frowned slightly, &quot;Is she asleep?&quot;

      Kari looked up at Jame from her seat, the two close
together. &quot;She&#39;s in a diagnostic mode for now,&quot; she explained as
Jame curiously looked over her shoulder at the computer code, &quot;we&#39;ll
revive her once we&#39;re finished debugging.&quot;

      Allaine had to smile slightly, watching the engineer and
younger woman interact. It was clear to her that Karin was more than
just kind to Jame, and more importantly Jame had begun to hesitantly
respond to her as well. Making a quick decision she got up, &quot;I&#39;d say
we&#39;ve made enough progress, do you want to call it a day?&quot;

      &quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Davies snagged a second sandwich
before getting up to leave. &quot;Boss, I&#39;m on shift next in engineering,
you&#39;ve got a few hours free.&quot;

      &quot;Thanks,&quot; Karin replied, feeling a moment of amusement at
how obvious the other two women were being, but didn&#39;t say anything
about it. Besides, it gave her a chance to be alone with Jame for a
little while. &quot;Are you on duty soon?&quot; she asked Jame curiously.

      &quot;No,&quot; Jame shook her head, the simple uniform jumpsuit she
wore spotlessly clean, &quot;I was just going off duty when I remembered
you were still here.&quot;

      Karin hesitated, then summoned up her nerve. &quot;I kind of
missed lunch earlier,&quot; she asked, &quot;would you care to join me in the
cafeteria for something?&quot;

      Jame nodded, &quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot;

      Carefully hidden behind a nearby corner Davies watched the
two head out of the computer room, smiling in satisfaction as they
talked together happily. It wasn&#39;t that she really wanted to match-
make, exactly, it was just that those two were so inept, they
wouldn&#39;t get anywhere without help.

      &quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot; the cool voice came from
behind Davies.

      Jumping slightly in surprise Davies quickly turned around to
see Allaine still there, the ship&#39;s second in command looking mildly
amused at her spying. &quot;Just seeing if we were successful, ma&#39;am,&quot;
she answered her honestly.

      Allaine actually chuckled softly. &quot;Fair enough,&quot; she
admitted, the two heading off in the direction of the lifts. &quot;Try to
keep this news from reaching Meris if you can,&quot; Allaine said
dryly, &quot;I understand she&#39;s had some interest in Jame, too.&quot;

      Davies had to shake her head, &quot;I&#39;m always impressed in how
much you know about what&#39;s going on in this ship.&quot;

      &quot;My spies are everywhere,&quot; Allaine shrugged casually, a
slight smile teasing her lips. They reached the lifts and Allaine
waved her in first, &quot;I&#39;ll see you later.&quot;

      &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Davies tossed off a casual salute as she descended
towards engineering.

      &#39;That woman doesn&#39;t take anything seriously,&#39; Allaine
thought as she took the lift up to the bridge, &#39;thankfully.&#39; That
kind of irreverence was refreshing, as long as the young woman
didn&#39;t break with the command structure. Exiting onto the bridge
Allaine swept the chamber with her eyes, quickly assessing the
situation.

      Ensign Rakka sat at navigation, the pink haired former
militia officer calmly handling the controls. Danielle stood beside
Hari, the little redhead looking a bit nervous as the tactical
officer ran the young woman through drills on that station. The only
other new arrival was Sara, the golden haired lieutenant-commander
who had suddenly found herself leading watches on the bridge.

      &quot;Attention! The Commander is on the bridge,&quot; Sara tossed off
a textbook salute, smoothly rising to her feet.

      &quot;At ease,&quot; Allaine answered calmly as Sara shifted to the
second in command seat and Allaine took the captain&#39;s
chair. &quot;Status?&quot; she asked crisply.

      Sara sat on the edge of her seat, the only real sign of her
nerves. &quot;Bridge situation is normal,&quot; she reported, &quot;we&#39;re running
drills while maintaining standard readiness.&quot;

      &quot;Good,&quot; Allaine answered then asked, &quot;has engineering passed
up the plans to move the SD power core yet?&quot;

      Sara passed over the data pad, &quot;There are three different
plans to move the Star Destroyer power core, actually.&quot;

      &quot;Karin&#39;s usual thoroughness,&quot; Allaine nodded as she scrolled
through the report. Along with the technical details there were
notes on crew disruption and other possible problems, something
Karin normally wouldn&#39;t include, and jumping to the end she noted
that Jame had contributed to the report. &#39;She compliments Karin
nicely,&#39; Allaine thought.

      &quot;I assume we&#39;ll need to pass this on to the captain for
authorization?&quot; Sara asked softly as conversation and work continued
around the bridge.

      &quot;The final decision is Captain Gail&#39;s,&quot; Allaine answered
simply. A faint smile, &quot;Ideally I&#39;d like us to drop out of hyper,
blow the engineering hatches and haul the SD core around with a
shuttle but it&#39;s not exactly practical right now.&quot;

      Keeping her voice down Sara asked, &quot;The Paranoid aren&#39;t that
close, are they?&quot;

      Dropping her own voice Allaine answered, &quot;They&#39;ve shown a
remarkable ability to find us, in all honestly. In theory our drives
are better, but we don&#39;t seem to be able to gain much of a lead.&quot;

      Sara sighed softly, &quot;Too bad we can&#39;t get farther ahead,
then.&quot;

      Allaine hesitated a moment, &quot;One of the crazies down in
Engineering have rigged up a engine modification, supposedly for
greater speed. If I bring up activating it to the captain again,
will you support me on it?&quot;

      &quot;What are the risks?&quot; Sara asked curiously.

      &quot;Davies designed it,&quot; Allaine answered, &quot;she&#39;s a drive field
expert, apparently, and says that the system will allow faster
transit in hyper. Talking to her the downside is the risk of losing
the drive field if Engineering doesn&#39;t keep a handle on the energy
flux.&quot;

      &quot;So the drive will be more temperamental,&quot; Sara noted. She
smiled faintly, &quot;I don&#39;t know what influence my vote will have, but
I&#39;m willing to try.&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;re on the command staff,&quot; Allaine said seriously, &quot;of
course your voice counts.&quot;

      &quot;This is going to take some getting used to,&quot; Sara
conceded, &quot;my last commander was a very spit-and-polish type.&quot; She
smiled in a slightly self mocking sort of way, &quot;As you can probably
tell.&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;ll adapt,&quot; Allaine said confidently.

      Keeping one eye on everything that was happening on the
bridge Sara added, &quot;I still can&#39;t quite get over how large this
vessel is.&quot;

      Allaine blinked. knowing that Lady Grace was really just a
small cruiser, but then she understood. &#39;Compared to that
underground command center Sara and her people had been living in,
the Grace must seem like a palace,&#39; she mused.</pre>
