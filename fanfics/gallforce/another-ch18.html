<h1>Another Journey, Another Story (part 18 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gallforce/index.html">Gall Force</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gallforce/another-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>Catty sat in the central seat in the computer room,
cables dangling from the back of her neck to the
primary terminals. A key was hit and light glowed from
the conduits as systems activated, the figure in the
chair twitching faintly. *reboot secondary systems*
*purge junk files* *personality subroutines engaged*
*primary systems... on*

Lieutenant-Commander Karin smiled slightly, her short
black hair a bit messy as the three of them waited for
her to come back on-line. Beside her Davies leaned
against a counter, her arm still held in a sling from
a injury a few days ago.

&#39;Of course she&#39;s probably leaving the sling on just to
get a few extra dates,&#39; Allaine thought, the tall dark
brown haired commander looking amused. She turned to
Karin, &quot;Thanks for pulling the all-nighter on this,&quot;
she murmured.

&quot;We were in the home stretch anyway,&quot; Karin shrugged,
&quot;and it feels good to be done.&quot;

There was a flicker of movement beneath Catty&#39;s eyes,
then her chin rose just slightly, Her face became
oddly more animated as her eyes opened, looking around
her curiously. &quot;How long was I out?&quot; she asked
curiously.

&quot;About a week,&quot; Davies answered, studying Catty
intently.

&quot;Eight days, six hours,&quot; Catty corrected, accessing
her internal clock. She tried to move then blinked,
&quot;There is a data-lock on my lower body?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re running a test on your interactive programs,&quot;
Karin explained, &quot;one of the areas we had to prune out
the most paranoid-related subroutines was in that area
of code.&quot;

Catty thought about that a moment, &quot;Reasonable.&quot;

With that Allaine, Davies and Karin ran through
several interactive scenarios, noting Catty&#39;s
responses and comparing them with what her onboard
files said she should do. &quot;I&#39;m sorry if this is
boring,&quot; Allaine found herself apologizing, &quot;but it&#39;s
necessary.&quot;

Catty actually smiled, her eyes crinkling with
amusement. &quot;No need to apologize, commander,&quot; she
reassured her, &quot;I understand the necessity.&quot;

&quot;Ah, right,&quot; Allaine blinked.

Later, when Catty had safely been put back into her
sleep mode Davies asked, &quot;Is it me, or is she more
emotive now?&quot;

&quot;It sort of makes sense,&quot; Karin noted, &quot;with all the
junk removed from her programs she probably responds
better.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; Allaine brought them back to business, &quot;do you
think it&#39;s safe to fully reactivate her?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d say yes,&quot; Davies answered her promptly, &quot;but I&#39;d
recommend adding some sort of monitoring chip, just in
case.&quot;

Karin nodded her agreement, &quot;We&#39;ve gone through her
code with a fine tooth comb, but Catty is remarkably
sophisticated... I&#39;d rather not take any chances.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Allaine nodded, &quot;I&#39;ll pass on your
recommendations to the captain.&quot; Pausing by the door
she added, &quot;Thank you both.&quot;

With that Allaine headed towards the lifts, already
considering what was coming next. They had bypassed
one abandoned colony yesterday, deciding that their
stores were still sufficient for the journey, but
another Solonoid planet was coming up. The crew needed
to be prepared for supplies retrieval or combat, as
well as the ship itself.

&#39;Thankfully Davies and the engineering teams have got
the Star Destroyer power core installed,&#39; Allaine
thought as she entered the lift. The massive construct
would supply their power needs and more, providing
them with increased range and combat capabilities.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Lieutenant Lauren nodded as she entered on
another level, the small blonde helmswoman smiling a
bit nervously.

&quot;Lieutenant,&quot; Allaine nodded courteously, &quot;I thought
you weren&#39;t on shift?&quot;

&quot;The new ensign is still a little nervous,&quot; Lauren
said, &quot;I offered to help her run through some of the
navigation drills.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s very kind of you,&quot; Allaine said, keeping her
expression neutral. Privately she found herself a bit
surprised that Lauren would be helping out the
newcomer. &#39;Then again,&#39; she thought, &#39;I haven&#39;t been
impressed with her since she had her affair with the
captain.&#39;

&quot;I don&#39;t want anything to go wrong,&quot; Lauren shrugged
slightly. She hesitated, &quot;It&#39;s strange, but now that
she&#39;s working under me I feel so... responsible for
her. Is that what it&#39;s like for you and the Captain?&quot;

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Allaine actually smiled faintly
as they reached the bridge. She waved Lauren out first
as she thought, &#39;Too bad she can&#39;t imagine what it&#39;s
like to be responsible for all the people on this
ship.&#39;

&quot;Commander,&quot; Danielle nodded from where she sat in the
captain&#39;s chair, the tactical officer looking intently
at the main screen, viewing out at the void.

Allaine returned the nod, &quot;Status?&quot;

Danielle smiled, the black haired officer saying,
&quot;Normal, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Is the Captain in the wardroom?&quot; Allaine asked as she
walked across the bridge towards the other access
hatch.

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Danielle agreed, turning back to her
work. She spoke up, &quot;Rakka, watch those controls
please.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; the pink haired ensign agreed. Rakka smiled
in relief as Lauren walked to her side, the two young
women working together silently.

Allaine activated the chime first, waiting to enter
until she heard a &quot;Come in.&quot;

The redheaded Captain Gail looked up with a smile as
she walked in, casually drinking from a mug of
stimulant as she ran through various department
reports at the table. Her eyes were tired but clear,
her face looking remarkably beautiful despite the
worry lines that were beginning to form at the corners
of her green eyes.

&quot;Captain,&quot; Allaine sat down beside her at the table
and passed over the report, &quot;Catty is ready to be
reactivated.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Gail ran through the file then asked,
&quot;Security chip?&quot;

&quot;A precaution both Karin and Davies endorsed,&quot; Allaine
answered promptly, &quot;while they&#39;re confident that we&#39;ve
debugged her programs, they both want to be cautious.&quot;

&quot;They wouldn&#39;t be engineers if they weren&#39;t,&quot; Gail
agreed. She looked at Allaine curiously, &quot;Do you agree
with them?&quot;

Allaine smiled wryly, &quot;After staring at screens of
code for so long I&#39;m nearly going cross-eyed.&quot; More
seriously, &quot;We&#39;re ninety-nine percent confident we&#39;ve
done it... it&#39;s just the last one percent that worries
me.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Gail chuckled. She looked out one of
the windows a moment then softly asked, &quot;And how is
the crew?&quot;

Allaine looked at her sympathetically, knowing how
isolated the captain could be from the crew. On one
hand that distance was necessary for her to maintain
command, but it couldn&#39;t be very easy for the other
woman. &quot;Morale is good,&quot; she said, &quot;and the new crew
members are integrating fairly well, so no problems
there.&quot;

A smile twitched the corner of her mouth, &quot;And the
latest gossip?&quot;

Allaine laughed, wondering how the crew would have
reacted to their captain&#39;s interest in that! &quot;Tanya
and Danielle are still a hot item and they&#39;ve even
stopped fighting much in public. Jame and Karin
finally went out, and I understand they&#39;re planning a
second date....&quot; Allaine relayed.

&quot;Wasn&#39;t Meris interested in Jame?&#39; Gail asked with
some amusement.

&quot;She isn&#39;t happy,&quot; Allaine agreed, &quot;though her new
assistant will hopefully distract her a bit.&quot; She look
thoughtful, &quot;Davies continues to work her way through
the crew singles, too.&quot;

&quot;Is she determined to bed every single woman on this
ship?&quot; Gail asked curiously.

&quot;Looks like it,&quot; Allaine shrugged. She smiled
slightly, &quot;Thankfully she&#39;s so charming that she can
get away with it.&quot;

&quot;Just as long as she doesn&#39;t target you,&quot; Gail
laughed, &quot;I don&#39;t think I could stand the shock.&quot;

Allaine shook her head, &quot;Not likely.&quot;
