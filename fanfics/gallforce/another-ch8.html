<a href="../gallforce/another-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>        Catty rose from her communications station, looking towards 
where the captain sat. With a simple formality she said, &quot;May I leave 
the bridge? My shift is over.&quot;

        Captain Gail nodded. &quot;Of course,&quot; the redhead said, &quot;Please keep 
you personal communicator in case you&#39;re needed for one of the emergency 
teams.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you ma&#39;am,&quot; Catty said. With that the purple haired woman 
left the bridge quietly, disappearing into the lift.

        Gail watched her go before turning to her second in command and 
quietly asking, &quot;Any rumors about her, maybe?&quot;

        Commander Allaine pitched her voice low as the dark brown haired 
woman said, &quot;She&#39;s more unusual in what&#39;s not happening. No 
relationships, not even rumors.&quot;

        Gail shook her head slightly as she turned back to the front 
viewscreen, &quot;I still can&#39;t get a feel for that woman.&quot;

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Allaine agreed with a sigh. She tilted her head to 
look at Gail, &quot;Is something bothering you about her?&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Gail sighed, &quot;I just wish I knew what.&quot;

        Completely unconcerned that the others might be talking about 
her Catty descended in the lift, exiting into the engineering section. 
She made her way down the hallway, occasionally giving casual nods to 
any passing crew members. She made her way to a unmarked door, using a 
keycard to open the door and go inside.

        The computer center within was lined with monitors, a single 
station set up to allow a user interface. Catty strode over, sitting 
down there before her fingers flew over the keyboard, accessing data 
from around the entire Lady Grace. Faces flashed in the screens, the 
bridge crew, engineering staff, fighter pilots and other members of the 
crew.

        Catty paused, then began to type more slowly. She called up an 
encrypted storage archive hidden within the mainframe, creating a 
document there, then began to type out her report...

        Catty, Unit designate #0123, currently stationed aboard the 
light cruiser Lady Grace. Current location is unknown as we are 
transiting through hyperspace towards the boarder of Solenoid and 
Paranoid space and beyond. Mission status: ongoing.

        This unit was first assigned to the Lady Grace several months 
ago as part of the covert plan of the Paranoid/Solenoid leadership to 
attempt fusion of our dissimilar races. Few opportunities have arisen to 
facilitate any fusion attempts, and those that have arisen were thwarted 
through the quick actions of the ship&#39;s Captain Gail.

        Any Paranoid assaults against the Lady Grace have largely failed 
due to the ship&#39;s command maintaining strict order. The fighter crews 
have been remarkably successful against their Paranoid counterparts, 
with the ship providing much needed support. Oddly, the captain has gone 
against good tactical reasoning in preserving her fighter crews, 
endangering the vessel itself to do so.

        Ship to ship combat has been surprisingly inconclusive between 
the Lady Grace and other vessels of her size. The incident that slew the 
previous captain was arguably a command error, but the surviving crew 
rallied around Gail to preserve the ship. Gail herself commands a fierce 
loyalty from her crew even with the recent crew losses, along with her 
second Allaine.

        Allaine herself is something of an enigma. Promoted at the same 
time as Gail was she had formerly been an engineer, but has adapted to 
command well. She handles the day to day problems of a ship of the line 
well, in addition to showing no traces of personal ambition herself. The 
crew itself holds her in awe, referring to her privately as the Iron 
Lady.

        The ship&#39;s chief engineer, Lieutenant-Commander Karin is almost 
the typical scientist. The black haired woman is almost entirely 
preoccupied with the vessel&#39;s engineering concerns, working to maintain 
the now understaffed vessel at peak efficiency. She knows this vessel to 
a frightening degree, almost stumbling upon this data center several 
times.

        There are few sources of dissension within the bridge staff, 
only the occasional conflicts between tactical priorities. Lieutenant 
Danielle, the ship&#39;s tactical officer, is a cool and capable young woman 
who has developed a reputation for ruthlessness that is very well 
deserved. The black haired young woman made an enemy of Major Tanya, the 
commanding officer of the fighter wings, when Danielle advocated 
abandoning them to save the vessel. It is also possible that she resents 
the Captain for overriding her in this matter.

        The other potential point of conflict is the new chief medical 
officer, Lieutenant-Commander Meris. The tall blonde officer has 
performed her duties admirably on board this vessel, but her past record 
is spotty at best. Bounced from ship to ship for poor fitness reports 
she was finally caught on her last ship stealing medical supplies to 
feed her addiction. While other officers have not stated their 
reservations publicly, it is clear they have them.

        My mission has become somewhat problematical with the new course 
that our captain has set. Using historical archives that I was ordered 
to help recover as a guide she seeks to find lost Solenoid colonies out 
beyond Paranoid space. But to do this, we will need to run right through 
the Paranoid territories, with the quantity of vessels and military 
forces awaiting us unknown.

        The effects of discovering those colonies could shift the entire 
war, entirely change the balance of power. Reinforcing the Solenoid 
forces could allow us to implement the final solution to the Paranoid 
threat, reinvigorating our race. The difficulty becomes in predicting 
the reaction of these lost people to being drawn into our war.

        In light of this situation I am abandoning the fusion protocols 
for the time being, and intend to assist the ship and crew in achieving 
their goals. I will maintain my cover as a standard crew member, and 
will attempt to blend into the crew with my standard efficiency. 
Emergency communication methods will be used if we are successful.

        ... Catty leaned back in her seat for a moment, studying the 
report that she had typed. She saved the document to the secure archive, 
then began to shut all the systems in the computer room down, carefully 
hiding it from the rest of the ship in the process.

        Once Catty was satisfied that her work was done she checked the 
hallway for motion. Patiently she waited until an officer had strode by, 
considering what she needed to do next. When the coast was clear Catty 
walked out, sealing the room shut behind her.

        The trip back to her quarters was as quick and efficient as she 
could manage, Catty politely dealing with the few acquaintances that she 
knew. She shed her uniform as soon as she got in, stepping into the 
personal shower. She really didn&#39;t need to use it, but it was the custom 
to do so after work. Catty stepped out and toweled herself dry, then 
changed into a clean uniform.

        The halls were quiet, only the occasional crew member passing by 
as Catty walked to the mess hall. She ordered her usual meal from the 
dispenser, collecting the tray and then turning to look over the dining 
tables, taking in the few crew members there.

        &quot;Hey,&quot; Davies gave her a wave, the sandy haired engineer smiling 
slightly.

        Catty made her way over, sliding in to the empty space across 
from the young woman. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said simply, laying out her food 
simply.

        &quot;Any good gossip from the bridge?&quot; Davies asked curiously.

        Catty remembered to smile slightly as she said with some 
dignity, &quot;I don&#39;t gossip.&quot;

        Davies snorted with amusement, &quot;Yeah, right. One of these days 
I&#39;ll get you to tell me all your secrets, you know.&quot;

        Catty raised an eyebrow, &quot;Not likely.&quot;

        Davies dug into her food with vigor, enjoying it while Catty 
worked through hers methodically. &quot;Don&#39;t you ever get bored eating the 
same thing?&quot; Davies asked.

        Catty looked down at her plate thoughtfully, &quot;It&#39;s nutritionally 
balanced, containing the proper amounts of several dietary 
requirements...&quot;

        &quot;But do you like it?&quot; Davies asked.

        &quot;Well...&quot; Catty blinked, not sure how to answer that.

        &quot;Here,&quot; Davies offered her a fork full of gravy covered mashed 
potatoes, &quot;try it.&quot;

        Catty leaned forward, taking a bite. She chewed thoughtfully, 
then swallowed, the taste lingering in her mouth. &quot;That is... good,&quot; she 
admitted finally.

        &quot;Try some variety,&quot; Davies smiled, &quot;who knows, maybe you&#39;ll like 
it.&quot;

        Catty felt a moments confusion at the other woman&#39;s tone, but 
she still smiled back slightly. &quot;Maybe I will,&quot; she offered.

To be continued...

Author&#39;s Notes: Catty was a character in the original Gall Force anime 
series, and was revealed to be an android. In the series several Catty 
androids were revealed to exist, so I didn&#39;t think I was pushing my luck 
in using her. The Fusion project was an attempt to combine Paranoid and 
Solenoid DNA that eventually created humanity.</pre>
