The Captain strode on to the cramped bridge, the small
space barely able to hold the four officers there. The
command chair was set at the back, then attack and
defense stations, then at the front the ship&#39;s
navigator.

Her blue hair matched that of her four companions, her
expression calm, almost remote. &quot;And how is Birthplace
today?&quot; she asked with gentle amusement.

&quot;Quite well, Rowas Lariel,&quot; the navigator said with a
smile, her eyes equally warm.

Lariel smiled slightly. She had been named Rowas, or
captain, of this vessel only a few years ago, but it
still felt odd bearing the title. For a long time she
had been &#39;Alm Rodial&#39; the navigator, then slowly
rising to &#39;Soporuka&#39; officer. Becoming Rowas of a Gel
assault ship hadn&#39;t been her plan, but it seemed to be
working out well.

&quot;Rowas,&quot; the Lekle, sometimes called Senior Navigator
or Defense officer spoke up, Spoor&#39;s voice musical,
&quot;I&#39;m detecting ships entering into the system.&quot;

&quot;Pilgrims?&quot; Lariel asked.

&quot;No ma&#39;am,&quot; the Soporuka officer Feia jumped in, a
unusual degree of eagerness in the attack officer&#39;s
voice, &quot;its a ship of the Predecessors!&quot;

Lariel stiffened. &quot;Go to cloak,&quot; she ordered the Alm
Rodial Selin. &quot;Please confirm,&quot; she addressed the
bridge, all business now. It took only a few moments
for the data to start coming up on the view screen,
information and comparisons with historic files.

&quot;I matches Solenoid design philosophies,&quot; Selin said
after a moment, &quot;taking into account several centuries
of progress.&quot; She highlighted a section of damaged
hull and asked, &quot;Is that what I think it is?&quot;

Feia&#39;s voice was grim as she said, &quot;The ship-wounds
match our records of Paranoid weapon&#39;s discharges.&quot;

&quot;But I thought we destroyed the Paranoid....&quot; Spoor
murmured.

&quot;It was never confirmed,&quot; Lariel mused softly, &quot;all we
knew for certain was that we drove the Paranoid from
the territory we claimed.&quot;

&quot;Understood, Rowas,&quot; Spoor nodded.

&quot;Backtrack their entry vector,&quot; Lariel ordered, &quot;where
did they come from?&quot;

&quot;From the home territory of the Predecessors,&quot; Selin
said after a moment, &quot;and it seems they followed the
route our forefathers took to Birthplace.&quot;

&quot;By chance,&quot; Lariel mused softly, &quot;or intent?&quot;

They watched as the Solenoid ship settled into orbit,
launching shuttles then observing as the smaller craft
dropped to the surface of Birthplace. The hours ticked
by as they observed, both the ship and the people it
sent forth, collecting and studying information.

Selin scanned the surface cautiously then reported,
&quot;They appear to be collecting supplies, food and other
provisions.&quot;

&quot;Our records of normal procedure would have had a
Solenoid return to base for supplies,&quot; Feia said
thoughtfully.

&quot;They&#39;re far from home,&quot; Spoor offered then she
hesitated before adding, &quot;or maybe they have no home
to return to.&quot;

They watched for a while longer, seeing the fighters
sweeping space in a carefully plotted pattern. A few
times a fighter nearby brushed their Gel but a careful
nudge of drives wiggled them by, keeping them safely
concealed.

Lariel rose, her cape swirling around her slim body as
she walked to the rear hatch. &quot;I&#39;ll be in the
communications suite if needed,&quot; she said coolly,
&quot;continue to monitor.&quot;

The passage led through the small vessel&#39;s interior,
past hatches leading to weapon stations or quarters,
then to the communications room. Like the rest of the
ship it was designed for efficiency and comfort, large
enough to relax in and also accomplish all the needed
tasks.

Lariel deployed the communications device, a modified
antiproton cannon, then aimed it at the cloaked
receiver across the system. She composed her initial
report calmly, detailing known facts and only
digressing to speculation near the end.

&quot;I believe,&quot; Lariel wrote, &quot;that our successful war
with the Paranoid did not destroy the race, but
instead merely drove it from their original territory.
They then entered the homeland of the Predecessors,
the Solenoids, and proceeded to do great damage.&quot;

Lariel looked off into the distance, trying to imagine
what it must have been like. The battle hardened,
desperate Paranoid must have demolished the Solenoid
at first, burning through any defense and inflicting
incredible casualties before the Solenoid could gather
their forces and fight back. Even more ironically the
Paranoid&#39;s technology must have been much better, all
the efforts they had made to catch up with her
people&#39;s innovations in attack or defense would have
given them a incredible advantage over their peaceful
foes.

&quot;The Solenoid seem to have closed the technological
gap with the Paranoid, but they clearly do not match
our own technology. In my opinion we are obligated to
help undue the harm we have inadvertently caused,&quot;
Lariel finished, &quot;though I do not know how.&quot; With that
she downloaded it to chip and sent the recording off
in a burst transmission to NewHome.

As Lariel returned to the bridge she saw on the
viewscreen a remarkably clear image of the surface.
Selin frowned slightly, &quot;It looks like they&#39;ve found
the Cradles, the bases our people first lived in on
Birthplace.&quot;

&quot;We left them as if we intended to return,&quot; Lariel
said thoughtfully as she settled into her seat, &quot;I
wonder how they&#39;ll take that?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ll likely realize it&#39;s odd,&quot; Spoor suggested,
&quot;but why it&#39;s odd they may not know.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t underestimate them,&quot; Feia reminded them, &quot;the
evolutionary difference between us and them isn&#39;t all
that great.&quot;

&quot;They are our foremothers,&quot; Lariel agreed, &quot;we must
treat them with the utmost respect.&quot;

Just then the musical chime of an alarm rang across
the bridge and the crew silently went to work. On the
screen the image shifted to the edge of the system,
where three Paranoid vessels shifted out of hyper into
normal space. It took only a minute or so for the
Predecessors to detect them, too, then the shuttles
quickly returned to their ship.

&quot;What do you think our Foremothers will do?&quot; Spoor
asked softly.

Feia made a uncertain gesture. &quot;If their sensors are
good they may attack the wounded bird,&quot; she
highlighted the lagging ship, &quot;if not, they could
either maneuver fighters and ship to attack together,
or use fighters to screen their retreat.&quot;

&quot;Sacrifice rodail to save themselves?&quot; Selin sounded
shocked. A true leader never sacrificed their
officers, the rodail, to save their lives, it was
considered dishonorable.

&quot;Tactically they may have no choice,&quot; Spoor
conceded... then it was as if the Solenoid ship
exploded with power.

&quot;By the Empress....&quot; Lariel breathed out, &quot;what was
THAT?&quot;

&quot;Immensely powerful energy discharge,&quot; Feia said after
a quick analysis, &quot;much more so than a ship that size
should be able to produce.&quot; Their was real admiration
in her voice, &quot;They&#39;d be mad to try, but I suspect
they&#39;ve got the power core of a much larger vessel in
there.&quot;

One by one the Solenoid ship struck, the Paranoid
craft sent reeling away from them. The third, wounded
foe detonated moments later, shifting the odds once
more. Spoor looked up at Lariel, &quot;If we act now....&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Lariel shook her head firmly, &quot;we cannot. If we
act without permission, it could have grave
consequences on the Empire.&quot;

Before the debate could grow the Paranoid seemed to
open up, life a flower with seeds as fights wheeled
out to surround the vessels in a cloud of death.
&quot;There&#39;s three hundred fighters out there,&quot; Feia
reported softly, &quot;they&#39;ve launched everything they
have.&quot;

&quot;The Solenoid fighters are launching in return,&quot; Selin
noted, &quot;and the Solenoid main ship is following them
in. It looks like they&#39;re preparing for a final
confrontation.&quot;

Lariel&#39;s arm band chimed, informing her that a
transmission had come in from command. She tapped a
control on her seat and read the message, a smile
tugging at her lips.

&quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; Spoor dared to ask.

&quot;Decloak, deploy weapon systems!&quot; Lariel said with a
feral smile, &quot;We&#39;ve just received permission to assist
our Foremothers!&quot;

To be continued....

Notes: The language and other details are loosely
based on the Abh from Crest of the Stars. I&#39;ve tweaked
them into a all female race, of course, and other
changes have been made. My reference was the mangas,
but if I couldn&#39;t find an Abh term, I occassionally
modified something else....</pre>
