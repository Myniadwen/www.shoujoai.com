<h1>Gall Force: Project Exodermus (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gallforce/index.html">Gall Force</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/quanto.html">Quanto</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Preface 

The first ideas for this popped into my head about a year ago while 
working on a remake for my earlier Gall Force fic &quot;Battlezone Earth&quot;. 
While writing that story, I was getting more and more disillusioned with 
the old concept of &quot;Bring the girls back to life, and then write about 
their adventures in coping with life on a developed Terra.&quot;  

While the concept has worked for a long time for many Gall Force 
writers, I myself have never been comfortable in traveling the beaten 
path, besides, writers such as George Pollock Jr. and Fred Herriot had 
already done a far better job in that task already. So with that in mind 
I couldn&#39;t help but notice a lot of great concepts that those writers 
had introduced without actually fleshing them out to the point I 
personally would have liked.  

On top of that, in both stories, the girls are often thrust into 
heterosexual relationships almost haphazardly while in my opinion they 
probably would still be more interested in each other, as a result I 
plan to bring more Shoujo Ai elements into Gall Force as well. 

There are plenty of possible pairings, but since I want to make this as 
Canonical as possible (I know, I know, this is a fanfic.) I plan on 
focusing on only a few. 

First of which being a relationship only hinted at in Blue Sister, by 
Kenichi Sonoda, is one between the Young Catty Nebulart (before she 
became head of Solnoid Intelligence) and a rather rough and tough 
looking woman named Rica. 

Other pairings will most likely include the classic and very much 
required &quot;Lufy/Rabby&quot; pairing, and probably a brief &quot;Rabby/Eluza&quot; 
pairing. 

But one pairing I can&#39;t wait to write about would have to be between 
Shildy and Catty (the android this time). Its hinted at briefly in Gall 
Force: Destruction but a few fans that I had a run-in with were in 
disagreement with me. ( I don&#39;t understand why really, the thought of 
Shildy and Catty sharing a bed sounds pretty awesome IMO.) 

But at any rate, that is far in the future and this is still the 
beginning, so without further ado, I present, the first in a complete 
retelling, &quot;Gall Force: Project Exodermus&quot;</pre>
