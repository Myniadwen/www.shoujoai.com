<h1>Another Journey, Another Story (part 1 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gallforce/index.html">Gall Force</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>        Captain Gail looked out the viewport at the wreckage of the 
Solonoid and Paranoid fleets, a massive debris field that would likely 
choke any ship passage in this system for years to come. She was 
pretty young to be a ship&#39;s captain, this twenty five year old 
redhead, a promotion that she gained after their previous captain had 
been killed when their ship&#39;s bridge received a direct hit a few 
months ago. As the Captain of the Solonoid cruiser Lady Grace she had 
proven herself again and again, but this test might be too much even 
for her.

        Gail looked back as casually as she could manage, watching as 
the conference room gradually filled with her bridge crew. Looking at 
them she had to admit that almost none of them would be where they 
were right now even a few decades ago. The long, grinding war with the 
Paranoid fleet had brought on both fast promotions and an increased 
chance of death in the fleet, something that had become a hard fact of 
life for them all.

        Commander Allaine sat right beside Gail&#39;s seat at the large 
round table, almost the exact same age and experience that she herself 
had. The dark brown haired second in command was tough, but she also 
had a gentle side that she worked quite hard to conceal. The two of 
them had been down in engineering when the bridge was hit during that 
fateful attack, and as the only two command level officers left alive 
they had taken charge, leading a successful counter attack against the 
Paranoid ambushers that had slain their captain.

        Lieutenant-Commander Karin was studying a data pad, patiently 
waiting for the meeting to start. The dark haired ship&#39;s engineer was 
a relatively new arrival, and hadn&#39;t made herself very popular with 
the engine room crews with her spot inspections and unannounced 
maintenance checks. On the other hand she had also caught two serious 
problems before they went critical, so she certainly seemed to know 
her stuff.

        Lieutenant Lauren looked a bit nervous sitting there, but then 
again helmswomen usually did look nervous when away from their posts. 
The slim blonde was fidgeting a bit when she realized that Gail had 
seen her. With an apologetic smile she forced herself to calm down.

        Gail forced herself to remain a cool appearance as she met the 
blonde&#39;s gaze steadily, but it wasn&#39;t very easy for her. They had been 
lovers once, her and Lauren, until Gail&#39;s strong sense of personal 
responsibility had forced her to break it off. But the feelings still 
lingered on, however much she might try to forget about them.

        Lieutenant Danielle was the ship&#39;s tactical officer, a cool 
and capable young woman with a reputation for ruthlessness that was 
very well deserved. In their last major conflict the black haired 
young woman had advocated that they abandon their shielding fighter 
groups to stage a tactical retreat, only to be overruled by the 
captain. From the intense look in her eye, it was clear that she 
hadn&#39;t forgotten about that public rebuke at all.

        Catty, their new communications officer, was still an enigma 
to Gail. The purple haired girl was quiet, unassuming, and as easy to 
read as a armor-plate wall. Her personnel file was unremarkable, but 
there was something about her that was off, somehow.

        Last, but certainly not the least, was Major Tanya, the 
captain of the fighter squads that were now housed in the ship. 
Effectively the same rank as Gail she was given a courtesy promotion 
to the rank of Major. The green haired pilot was tough, bearing the 
scars on her athletic body of more than one near miss, with a 
reputation to match She and Danielle hadn&#39;t gotten along terribly well 
even before the last battle, and from the look on her face she had 
probably heard all about the attempted abandoning of her fighter 
groups.

        &#39;And I get to be the one who has to try to keep them all from 
killing each other,&#39; Gail thought to herself with a wry smile.

        &quot;Captain,&quot; Allaine said to her softly, &quot;everyone&#39;s here.&quot;

        Gail slid into her seat smoothly and said, &quot;Then let&#39;s get 
this meeting underway.&quot; There were some nervous glances out the 
windows at the devastation, and Gail knew that she could just order 
the windows to be shut. But she chose not to do that. They all needed 
to understand the stakes and the consequences of any error.

        Allaine consulted her data before reporting, &quot;We&#39;ve tabulated 
all the survivors of the last Paranoid attack. Including the fighter 
crews we&#39;re down to 32 people.&quot;

        Gail tried not to wince. She knew their losses had been bad, 
but to have their crew reduced by so much! She forced the dismay she 
felt down, keeping any of it from showing on her face as she asked, 
&quot;How are your fighter wings, Tanya?&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ve reorganized in four wings of three pilots each,&quot; Tanya 
reported, &quot;the most senior pilot leading.&quot; She hesitated a moment 
before adding, &quot;And I&#39;m going out with them.&quot;

        According to the standard regulations, the leader of the 
fighter squads should never be out flying combat missions. &quot;They&#39;re 
your people, it&#39;s your call,&quot; Gail mentally tossed the rules right out 
the airlock as she nodded to her firmly. She turned to look at her 
chief engineer and hoped for good news, &quot;And how are the repairs 
going, Karin?&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ve been concentrating on getting the primary tactical 
systems and reserve ECM back on-line, and we&#39;ve been mostly 
successful,&quot; Karin reported crisply.

        &quot;Mostly?&quot; Gail raised an eyebrow.

        &quot;An entire bank of the targeting computers were destroyed,&quot; 
Danielle stepped in to explain, &quot;and we don&#39;t have the materials to 
fully replace it. We&#39;re hoping that the salvage teams have some luck, 
but I&#39;m not counting on it. If we can not replace it, at least some of 
our targeting will have to be done manually from the bridge.&quot;

        &#39;Salvage teams,&#39; Gail thought bleakly. They were literally out 
there sifting through the wrecks of their sister ships, praying that 
they would find anything useful. Keeping her voice level she asked 
Karin, &quot;Have you had any luck?&quot;

        Karin brought up a file on her screen, &quot;We&#39;ve recovered 
sufficient armor segments to replace the stores we used up in our 
repairs, and have accumulated parts for both the ship systems and the 
fighters. Water and rations, along with other supplies have also been 
recovered.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; she nodded to Karin. Gail turned to Danielle, 
&quot;Please give us all a summary of the present tactical situation.&quot;

        Danielle got out of her seat and brought the main screen in 
the room to life, giving them all an overview of the solar system they 
were now in. &quot;We are here,&quot; she touched a control and marked their 
position within the debris field, &quot;and the Paranoid are here.&quot; She 
highlighted three ships based on the far side of the debris, &quot;We 
activated our ECM systems as soon as we spotted them, and I&#39;m 
confident that they do not know we&#39;re here.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re sure about that?&quot; Major Tanya offered coldly.

        &#39;Yes, their friction is going to a problem,&#39; Gail thought to 
herself grimly. She was about to say something when someone else took 
it right out of her hands.

        Surprisingly Allaine spoke up in Danielle&#39;s defense, &quot;While 
our back- ups were temporarily off-line, our primary ECM was still 
fully effective, and with debris all around us made up of similar 
alloys to our hull, it will add to our cover.&quot;

        &quot;But once we start moving again,&quot; Gail supplied, &quot;we&#39;ll be 
visible again.&quot; She looked at the monitor, &quot;Do we know what class of 
ship they are?&quot;

        &quot;Their version of light cruisers,&quot; Danielle reported. With a 
grim little smile she said, &quot;Even with our present system limitations 
we could take any one of them in a fair fight, it&#39;s getting any of 
them alone that&#39;s going to be the problem.&quot;

        Gail hesitated, wishing someone else had the information as 
she asked, &quot;Lauren, what did you pick up while we were drifting?&quot;

        The slim blonde met her captain&#39;s eyes steadily as she checked 
over her file. &quot;We crossed the warp signature of another Solonoid 
ship, probably left behind when they received a general order to 
retreat,&quot; Lauren reported crisply.

        Gail could hear the murmurs around the table, the soft 
repeating of, &quot;Another ship made it.&quot; Or, &quot;There&#39;s other survivors.&quot; 
The bridge crew quieted after a moment, but Gail saw the hope in their 
eyes. And she hated herself for having to crush it.

        &quot;If we warp out after their ship, what will the Paranoid 
forces do?&quot; a grim faced Gail made herself ask Danielle softly.

        The mildly sick expression on Danielle&#39;s face told Gail that 
she had figured it all out. The tactical officer quietly said, &quot;Our 
ECM is far less effective when we&#39;re on the move. They would spot us 
immediately, and pursue.&quot; She paused a moment, &quot;And unless we were 
remarkably lucky, both ships would probably be destroyed.&quot;

        Gail was faintly surprised that Tanya spoke up right then, &quot;So 
why don&#39;t we run the other way, try to lead the Paranoid ships off?&quot; 
She shrugged slightly, &quot;Hey, who knows, we might even be able to out 
run them.&quot;

        Allaine and Gail had talked about all this before hand, of 
course. They and one other. But they hadn&#39;t been really expecting to 
get this kind of support from any of the bridge crew. &quot;I&#39;m a little 
surprised to hear you say that,&quot; Allaine managed.

        &quot;We fighter jocks know we&#39;re all living on borrowed time,&quot; 
Tanya shrugged again, &quot;I figure if we&#39;re going down anyway, let&#39;s save 
another ship in the process.&quot;

        &quot;We are not going down, as you so eloquently put it,&quot; Gail 
said to her forcefully, &quot;I intend to do everything I can to keep this 
crew intact.&quot;

        &quot;Tactically, though, it&#39;s not too bad of a plan,&quot; Danielle 
looked up to say coolly, &quot;as long as we have enough supplies and 
materials. We could quite successfully wear the enemy force down in 
this sort of running fight.&quot;

        Karin leaned forward, &quot;I&#39;ll redirect the salvage crews. We&#39;ll 
need reactor components and fuel reserves, if we&#39;re even going to 
attempt this.&quot; She paused a moment before she asked, &quot;But where, 
exactly, do we run to?&quot;

        Knowing this question was coming, that was Catty&#39;s cue to take 
over the display screen just as Gail and Alliene had rehearsed with 
her earlier on. A very simplified overall map of the Solonoid and 
Paranoid territories appeared on the screen.

        &quot;Before we first encountered the Paranoid we launched several 
colony ships through this region,&quot; Catty highlighted a path right 
through part of Paranoid space, &quot;where they established a few 
colonies. At least one of the colony ships then left both our and 
Paranoid territories, going off into completely uncharted regions of 
space.&quot;

        Allaine smiled grimly, &quot;We&#39;re certain that the colonies 
themselves were totally destroyed by the Paranoid, but there may be 
supplies and material&#39;s we can salvage.&quot;

        &quot;And then go try to find the missing colony ships,&quot; Lauren 
murmured.

        Gail stood up from her seat, gazing out into space. &quot;There&#39;s 
no guarantees in any of this, of course. The Paranoid could take us 
down before we even reach where the colonies were, much less finding 
the lost ships,&quot; she said simply.

        &quot;There&#39;s never been any guarantees in this job,&quot; Danielle said 
firmly.

        &quot;I really hate to have to agree with her,&quot; Tanya gave Danielle 
a very disdainful look, &quot;but I think she&#39;s right about this. You&#39;ve 
got a good crew here on the Lady Grace, and I figure we&#39;ve got as good 
chance as any to pull this off.&quot;

        There was a general chorus of agreement from the women of the 
command staff. Gail smiled, keeping her face turned away as she felt 
tears prickling at her eyes. Keeping her voice as steady as she could 
manage she said, &quot;All right. We&#39;ll do it.&quot;
