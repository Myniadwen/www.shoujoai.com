<h1>Another Journey, Another Story (part 21 of 24)</h1>

<a href="../gallforce/another-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>Allaine raised the energy blade, smoothly slicing into
the tree branch and sending a branch laden with fresh
fruit crashing to the ground. The taller brown haired
woman picked the bunch up and turned to her busy team
of food gatherers. &quot;All right, we&#39;ve got the rest of
the fruit,&quot; she asked them briskly, &quot;how about the
meat?&quot;

&quot;Mission accomplished,&quot; the voice lead about half of
the security team towards them. Lynn carried the
carcass of one of the beasts over her shoulder, the
lanky brown haired pilot handling the weight easily.
&quot;Is the med squad back yet?&quot;

A few moments later Toki arrived, the younger woman
looking nervous as she packed a sample case under her
arm. The red haired medic smiled sheepishly, &quot;Sorry,
ma&#39;am, but I think the CMO will be right along.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s Meris looking into?&quot; Allaine asked , keeping
any criticism out of her voice.

&quot;The Chief found larger quantities of unrefined
medicinal botanicals,&quot; Toki explained, &quot;they could be
extremely valuable, considering our limited supplies.&quot;

&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Lynn conceded.

Max trotted up the trail carrying another case, the
little pink haired tactical officer puffing softly
with exertion, then Meris followed. The tall,
aristocratic blonde nodded slightly, &quot;My apology for
the delay.&quot;

&quot;No problem, the other team should be heading back for
the shuttles too,&quot; Allaine said to her casually.

As a group they moved out, cutting through lush
forests and over overgrown paths towards the flat
plain they had landed on. The planet itself echoed
with animal calls, the air heavy with moisture,
bursting with life so different from the last world
they had been to.

&quot;I still wish we knew what happened to the people of
this world,&quot; Meris murmured as they walked to the
waiting shuttles.

Allaine raised a eyebrow, &quot;I thought it obvious. The
paranoid attacked, the colonists died or fled, and the
planet was overrun by nature.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m no expert, but from what I&#39;ve seen there&#39;s no
damage here... no signs of orbital or ground based
assault,&quot; Meris said. A pause as they reached the
shuttles and began loading, &quot;It&#39;s almost as if they...
just left.&quot;

Allaine looked thoughtful, &quot;Remind me to ask Davies
about the abandoned instillation, if it might have
been intentionally mothballed.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Meris flashed a smiled, carefully securing
the medical supplies in a section of the rapidly
filling cargo bay.

&quot;And don&#39;t mention the idea to the enlisted crew,&quot;
Allaine added softly, &quot;we don&#39;t want to raise false
hopes.&quot;

Lynn appeared a few moment&#39;s later, saluting crisply.
&quot;All secure, ma&#39;am, and the engineering team has
reported back as well,&quot; she reported.

&quot;Davies?&quot; Allaine looked around curiously.

&quot;Yo!&quot; Davies popped up from behind her.

Meris jumped in surprise, &quot;Do you have to do that?!&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; Davies smiled impishly, the sand haired young
woman&#39;s uniform and face smudged with dirt and grime.

Allaine looked at Davies curiously as she asked, &quot;What
did you get into this time?&quot;

&quot;Digging into the facilities buried here,&quot; Davies took
a cloth and tried to wipe off her hands, then
attending to her face.

&quot;Find anything interesting?&quot; Meris asked curiously.

&quot;Sort of,&quot; Davies folded the cleaning cloth up and
pitched it right into the shuttle&#39;s recycler. &quot;The
place wasn&#39;t abandoned due to an attack, but it wasn&#39;t
shut down and mothballed either,&quot; she explained, &quot;it&#39;s
almost as if they just... left one day.&quot;

The Commander and Meris exchanged a long look then
Allaine thoughtfully said, &quot;Well, isn&#39;t that
interesting.&quot;

Before they could continue their discussion the
annoying sound of an emergency call came through on
Allaine&#39;s communication link. &quot;All shuttles,&quot; Catty&#39;s
crisp voice rang in the shuttle&#39;s cargo bay, &quot;return
to ship immediately. Possible Paranoid warp signatures
have been detected, estimated time of arrival
unknown.&quot;

&quot;You heard the lady,&quot; Allaine said sternly, &quot;section
chiefs, check to see all your people are here. Let&#39;s
button up the shuttles and go!&quot;

A few minutes later and both of the shuttles were
smoothly cutting out of the edge of the planet&#39;s
atmosphere, a fighter escort forming around them as
they hurried back to the waiting Lady Grace. After a
few moments the fighters peeled off into patrol
positions once again and the shuttles entered into
their bay. Essential crew members bolted for their
positions while the rest of the gathering team
remained to store the supplies into the waiting
refrigerated containers.

&quot;Welcome back,&quot; Captain Gail said calmly, the redhead
sitting calmly in the center seat. She looked cool and
composed, studying the view screen, only the most
observant could see any tension in the set of her
shoulders.

Lieutenant-Commander Sara quickly vacated the second
in command&#39;s seat, giving Allaine a text-book salute.
&quot;Ship status normal,&quot; she reported before the golden
haired woman requested permission to leave the bridge.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Allaine nodded to her gravely as Sara
left. Settling into her seat she smiled at the
Captain, &quot;Situation?&quot;

&quot;Drive signatures inbound,&quot; Gail answered calmly,
&quot;initial scans read them as our three Paranoid
friends. There&#39;s also another complication.&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Allaine looked curious.

Danielle spoke up from her tactical station, &quot;I&#39;m
getting a odd ghost image on our sensor arrays, but I
can&#39;t lock on it or firm it up.&quot; The black haired
young woman sighed in frustration, &quot;It could be a
technical problem but it could also be a cloaked ship,
but if so it&#39;s substantially better than our tech or
the Paranoid.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m writing it off as a sensor blip, but Danielle&#39;s
going to be keeping an close eye on it,&quot; Gail said
seriously.

&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Allaine admitted, thoughts racing.

Davies had followed her in on the bridge along with
Meris, both taking up positions in stations behind the
command chairs. &quot;You want me to head down to
Astronomy?&quot; she offered. &quot;I could rig up a high power
scan on the blip.&quot;

&quot;Paranoid ships confirmed, moving into attack range,&quot;
Lauren said from the helm, her navigation sensors
having picked up the motion.

&quot;Confirmed,&quot; Danielle barked, &quot;your orders, ma&#39;am?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re moving out,&quot; Gail said quickly, &quot;pull our
fighters back till the enemy launches theirs, deploy
main guns.&quot;

Davies surprised them by heading to Danielle&#39;s side.
&quot;The new Star Destroyer power core we installed will
have a substantial effect on our firepower,&quot; she
informed her, &quot;your first few shots are going to be a
lot nastier than they&#39;re expecting.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going to enjoy this,&quot; Danielle purred.

Allaine leaned forward in her seat, &quot;Can you throw one
full burst of our fire into each of the ships in
series? That way we&#39;ll take full advantage of the
surprise....&quot; she grinned.

&quot;Will do,&quot; Danielle nodded.

The three Paranoid ships swept forward, unaware of
their danger even as the outer skin of the Lady Grace
shifted aside, revealing their main batteries. The
fighters cleared the way, soaring aside, then in a
blaze of red the beams surged forward. One by one the
organic looking Paranoid were stabbed by the streams
of fire, explosions lighting up the vessels then they
listed aside. Suddenly the third ship, which had been
lagging behind, lit up from within by secondary
explosions. It&#39;s skin bulged, the vessel rocking, then
in a burst of light it was gone.

&quot;Yes!&quot; Lauren burst out happily.

&quot;There&#39;s still two ships,&quot; Gail reminded them all
forcefully.

&quot;Ma&#39;am, the Paranoid are launching a massive wave of
fighters,&quot; Danielle shouted. On the screen a cloud of
fighters raced out of the two damaged vessels, well
over two hundred fighters total spreading out to sweep
towards them.

&quot;Retreat?&quot; Allaine asked her softly.

&quot;Not with that many fighters, they&#39;d just cut us off,&quot;
Gail answered quietly. A wry smile, &quot;Looks like they
saved them up for an assault like this.&quot;

Major Tanya&#39;s voice came on, &quot;Recommend we launch all
fighters, we&#39;ll screen your retreat.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re outnumbered more than two to one,&quot; Danielle
protested.
&quot;Launch all fighters,&quot; Gail said calmly, &quot;but we&#39;re
following you in. Prepare all weapons and activate
emergency systems.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; Lauren squeaked.

&quot;Even with the fighter situation we&#39;re facing better
odds than we&#39;ve had so far,&quot; Gail said calmly, &quot;it&#39;s
time to gamble.&quot;

&quot;The sensor ghost,&quot; Danielle cut off conversation,
&quot;it&#39;s a ship! Decloaking on port side!&quot;

&quot;Identify!&quot; Allaine barked.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Danielle barked, &quot;it&#39;s not listed in
Paranoid or Solenoid ship databases!&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re firing!&quot;</pre>
