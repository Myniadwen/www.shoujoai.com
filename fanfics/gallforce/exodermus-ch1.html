<h1>Gall Force: Project Exodermus (part 1 of 3)</h1>

<pre>Commander Dawn sat in his ready room as he poured over the datapad 
handed to him by his adjutant. The old Paranoid Commander&#39;s alien face 
changed from generally expressionless to something of genuine concern. 
He turned to his adjutant. &quot;All six of them died?&quot; He asked him 
quizzically. 

The adjutant shuffled his mechanical exoskeleton slightly as his yellow 
eyes darted about, &quot;Y-yes sir. At the moment our intelligence probes 
have yet to get any useful information from the Solnoid medical team 
that examined them. It seems that the Solnoids are even more in the dark 
with what we are doing than we suspected they would be. What&#39;s even more 
disturbing is that it seems they know even less about their own anatomy 
than we do.&quot; 

&quot;So there is nothing useful we can get from them that would allow us to 
correct any mistakes?&quot; Dawn asked as he stood to stare out of the room&#39;s 
observation windows. The Paranoid Homeworld hung serenely in space, the 
great fleets of its children protecting it from their Solnoid enemies. 
If there was anyplace more comforting to look upon, Dawn could not think 
of it. 

&quot;No sir, unfortunately there is little chance for us to get anything at 
all without the Solnoid Central Guard finding out about it.&quot; 

Dawn sighed as he sat back down. He looked upon his desk, in a moment of 
quiet contemplation. &quot;What of the reports of the Solnoid System 
Destroyer?&quot; 

&quot;Its confirmed sir, they&#39;ve just completed one and they claim to be 
prepared to use it.&quot; 

&quot;Leader Journey talking like she has the advantage again, huh?&quot; 

The Adjutant chuckled slightly, &quot;Yes, sir. Leader Born was very quick to 
reminder her that we have two though.&quot; 

Dawn&#39;s expression went from humorous to very grave, at least for a 
Paranoid, &quot;Both of them are going to doom us all to extinction if they 
keep this up.&quot; 

&quot;Excuse me sir?&quot; The adjutant asked him, rather perplexed. 

&quot;No, its nothing. Good work, Dran.&quot; 

The adjutant&#39;s gill-like mouth began to tremble as if he were about to 
say something then he paused for a moment and then bowed. &quot;Yes sir.&quot; He 
turned to the door leading to the ship&#39;s bridge and left. 

Dawn leaned back in his commander&#39;s chair, unsure of where to take the 
project next. It seemed to have already run into a dead-end, and so 
early in its trial phase. He looked about his ready room. On one wall 
were all of his awards and decorations for many years of distinctive 
service to his people. The wall curved inwards towards the ceiling and 
down to the opposite wall, where he kept his souvenirs from previous 
campaigns. So many long years of service, so many years of fighting, and 
yet, just as all of the previous Paranoid Central Intelligence 
Commanders, he felt trapped in a nightmare he would never escape. Only 
this time, with the threat of the Planet Destroyers, and now the System 
Destroyers, it seemed as though the nightmare was coming closer and 
closer to its horrifying conclusion. 

Mutually Assured Destruction, it was a term created by the Solnoids. To 
add an even greater irony to their new term, they further shortened it 
to MAD. It seemed so fitting even to the old Paranoid Commander. Madness 
was the only thing that could have brought the two galactic super powers 
to this point. 

There had to be an escape. Even the crazed Paranoid Leader Born had 
recognized the severity of the threat that MAD posed. It was this very 
realization that lead to Project Exodermus in the first place. And it 
was Commander Dawn&#39;s Experience in intelligence gathering and research 
that landed him smack in the middle of the whole project. 

Two years it took them to get to the point they were at now. All of the 
experimentation, all of the wasted resources, and the wasted lives. Dawn 
could still remember the shrill deafening screams made by the Solnoid 
captives as they tried to learn as much about their anatomy as they 
could. It was out of those torturous six months that Dawn finally 
discovered what he had been looking for; the secret to the old form of 
Solnoid reproduction. A strange cavernous organ that produced a number 
of inert cells once a month. It was this that clued Dawn in as to how he 
would merge the Paranoid race and the Solnoid race into one, and 
hopefully end this costly war. 

Of course, there would be complications. As Dawn suspected, the two 
races were so completely different that a simple &quot;Cross-Breed&quot; would be 
impossible. And to further complicate things, the paranoid possessed no 
such ability to create the cell necessary for a proper reproductive 
reaction. And on top of it all, the Solnoids that he and his personnel 
tried questioning about the cavernous organ, knew nothing of it or about 
it. 

Dawn couldn&#39;t blame them though, the war had been raging for over one 
thousand years, there hadn&#39;t been a &quot;Male&quot; Solnoid in nearly as much 
time, of course they would forget. 

It was times like these that he wished he could simply revert back to 
his gelatinous state and simply ooze in one place. The overload of 
misinformation and sudden news of initial failure was starting to grain 
down upon the old commander. Either they would have to find a new 
solution or he would have to report directly to Born on their failure. 
Such an action would almost certainly be catastrophic. 

He stood up from his chair and was about to walk out of the room when 
his adjutant stormed back inside. &quot;Sir!&quot; He bowed hastily, &quot;forgive my 
intrusion, but our bug in the Solnoid medical facility has been 
discovered.&quot; 

Dawn could feel all of his fears coming down upon him at that very 
moment. He reached up and braced himself against the wall with his left 
arm as he prevented himself from falling to the floor. He righted 
himself and looked directly at the adjutant, &quot;How? What happened?&quot; 

&quot;We haven&#39;t been told yet sir, but the Solnoid reaction is nothing less 
than we would have expected. They are of course enraged.&quot; 

We can all most certainly imagine that you moron, Dawn thought to 
himself. &quot;Have all links cut off; I don&#39;t want them tracing the 
transmissions back to our ship.&quot; 

&quot;The link was already severed sir.&quot; Dran handed Dawn the report. 

Dawn took it and threw it to his desk. &quot;We can&#39;t tell high command about 
this Dran, do you hear me?&quot; 

&quot;Sir?&quot; 

&quot;Have all personnel involved with the intelligence gathering mission put 
in lockdown, I don&#39;t want this leaking out in any way shape or form.&quot; 

&quot;But sir, Leader Born will surely want to know the progress of the 
project.&quot; 

&quot;Tell him it has been scrapped, for logistical reasons.&quot; Dawn knew it 
would be a poor excuse, but with any luck the Leader would be 
preoccupied with plans of countering the new Solnoid System Destroyer. 

&quot;So am I safe in assuming that we will be canceling further 
contact-point missions?&quot; 

&quot;No. The project will continue in secret. From now on, we operate under 
our own discretion; the High Command no longer needs to know about this 
project.&quot; 

&quot;Sir I don&#39;t understand. What you are saying is treasonous.&quot; 

Dawn dwelled on his adjutant&#39;s words for only a moment, &quot;No, Dran, this 
is for our survival. If the Solnoid Intelligence traces that bug back to 
us, I want to make sure that it doesn&#39;t get all the way back to High 
Command, this project cannot be abandoned at any cost.&quot; 

&quot;Then sir, if you don&#39;t mind my asking. What will we do next?&quot; 

&quot;Continue with the project, we have to have at least one successful 
contact out of this.&quot; Dawn turned to his desk, stopped and turned back 
to his adjutant, &quot;Make sure that our next batches of contact-points are 
thoroughly screened for genetic incompatibility this time. I don&#39;t want 
any failures on our next run.&quot; 

&quot;Yes sir.&quot; Dran left the room in earnest as Dawn returned to his desk.

He lifted the datapad which contained the latest intelligence report, 
then crushed with all the strength his metallic exoskeleton could 
provide. No one outside of his immediate command would know of this 
project. The crushed glass and plastic fell to the floor in scattered 
bits. Dawn breathed deeply as he looked down upon the floor. There was 
not turning back from this path he had chosen. History would remember 
him as either a hero, or a villain; nothing more, nothing less. He knew 
deep inside that what he was doing would be the best hope for his 
people&#39;s survival, the only thing that bothered him now was the Solnoid 
equation, and it was the Solnoids who would either make or break the 
entire project. 

He turned his chair around, and looked outside at his Homeworld. He 
gleaned over the many ridges and craters of his battle scarred planet. 
Strangely, the Paranoids were able to continue their civilization on the 
battered world, cities and military installations littered and filled 
every crater. He lay back in his chair and drifted further into thought. 
&quot;If only it were possible to get the Solnoids involved cooperatively.&quot;</pre>
