<h1>Light on the Water</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kurau/index.html">Kurau Phantom Memory</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ryuchan.html">Carola "Ry√ªchan" Eriksson</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The fireflies glowed and danced over the surface of the mountain lake 
under dark and star-strewn skies at the late hour, all humans in the 
nearby house deep in slumber and missing out on this precious dance of 
light that took place close by. Another woman would have thought it 
looked like the stars themselves had come down from the heavens to play 
and frolic above the water&#39;s dark mirror, but not Kurisumasu. 

No, Kurisumasu, pulled towards the swirling lights as if by aching 
invisible strings, thought nothing of stars as the lights beckoned her 
to join them. Instead her sorrow and her longing, that which she 
struggled so hard to keep in check during the day, strained against the 
cage of her chest, threatening to tear her apart. 

The young black-haired woman stood for a moment at the edge of the tiny 
landing where her uncle&#39;s rowboat lay anchored, then pale bare feet left 
the edge of the wooden planks and Kurisumasu joined the dancing lights, 
her own light a bright, welcoming glow that danced gently among the tiny 
flecks. 

For Kurisumasu was not human. No matter what she did or how much she 
tried, this fact would not change... Kurisumasu was still, and always 
would be, a Rynax creature, for all she was in this vast world of 
humans. 

Tears made their way down glowing cheeks, the tears that she no longer 
allowed herself to shed during the day but that had in truth never dried 
during all these years. Kurisumasu was... alone. 

The glowing woman doubled over in her swirling dance, the pain in her 
chest just too much for her to take. Alone. She was Rynax and she was 
alone. A Rynax cannot exist alone, yet here she was, the only Rynax that 
still remained in the world of man. Kurisumasu bit her lip trying not to 
scream her pain. 

Around her floated the fireflies, their luminous flight so reminiscent 
of her own kind, of the true form of Rynax as tiny, ever-glowing, 
ever-dancing points of light in the vast world hidden within the tiniest 
of building blocks that made this world. Eternally dancing in the 
embrace of their Pair. 

Kurisumasu floated higher, nearly breaking from the twirling lights of 
the fireflies, turning her face towards the pale light of the full moon. 
She reached out her arms as if to embrace it, yet it was not that pale 
satellite that she saw. A broken whisper left full lips and quivered in 
night air, the only sound in this little universe of light. 

&quot;Kurau&quot; 

Kurisumasu&#39;s Pair. Her Pair, her partner, her twin, her soul, her 
mate... there existed no single word in any human tongue that could hope 
to accurately describe what Kurau was to her. Humans had no words 
because they could not grasp this, not really understand what it was to 
be one entity divided into two sentient parts, but there were those that 
tried, friends that tried to understand and sympathise with Kurisumasu&#39;s 
pain. She loved them all the more for it, and in return she only showed 
them her smiling face. 

But inside Kurisumasu was always crying. She had been doing that ever 
since that night ten years ago, when her Pair, her beloved, her Kurau... 
left this vast world without her. 

Even as the humans around her, those she considered friends and family, 
rejoiced as the threat of Rynax left this world along with her precious 
Kurau, the small child Kurisumasu had been then had broken down in such 
deep and uncontrollable tears that her friends had feared she would do 
herself damage. She had been escorted back here, to this small mountain 
valley and to her aunt and uncle, in the hopes that their love would 
help her heal. 

Kurisumasu had agreed with the decision, not merely because she loved 
her aunt and uncle dearly, although she did, but also because it was far 
away from... her. Other-Kurau, the human woman who bore the name and the 
face of Kurisumasu&#39;s lost beloved yet nothing of her spirit. Other-Kurau 
was not a bad person, far from it, the woman had in fact even taken the 
time to visit or write to Kurisumasu upon occasion, to see how she fared 
in the world on her own, but the visits were too painful. To see another 
soul look at her through the blue eyes where love had always lived 
before was just too much for Kurisumasu, and Other-Kurau respected that.  

Kurisumasu felt both relieved and grateful for this measure of 
understanding, and although now, ten years later, little remained in 
Other-Kurau&#39;s features that were truly that reminiscent of Kurisumasu&#39;s 
Kurau, it would still be too painful to see. Father, on the other hand, 
Kurisumasu had been sad to notice kept no contact with his supposed 
&#39;second daughter&#39;, presumably too pleased with having his real, human, 
child back and opting to forget all about the pain of the last twenty 
years caused all by his experiments. 

She did not fault him, it was understandable that he would and 
Kurisumasu had as loving parents as she could ever have wished for in 
her aunt and uncle, and these mountains where her Kurau had played as a 
child were dear to her. Kurisumasu did not lack for friends in this 
world, both near and far, Dag even going so far as to come visit her 
every now and again to see how she was doing and to speak of Kurau. He 
had perhaps seen the most of their shared life, hers and Kurau, and 
understood somewhat more of Kurisumasu&#39;s hidden pain than others did, of 
that she was certain. 

Dag often brought his son along for these visits, Ted, which Kurisumasu 
had always welcomed as a child as the boy became a treasured friend as 
well, but the young woman found a source of... concern. As children they 
had played together, and somewhere along the line she had gotten used to 
calling him her boyfriend as a joke. It had seemed a harmless joke, her 
family knew well the impossibility of the concept, as did Dag, as did 
most certainly Kurisumasu herself... she had thought Ted did as well, 
but somehow it seemed he had forgotten as they grew older. 

It was with a sense of guilt that Kurisumasu had asked, somewhat 
awkwardly, her friend Dag to explain to his son what she somehow had 
once again failed to convey; that although Kurau was not with her, 
Kurisumasu would eternally belong to her and her alone regardless. She 
felt guilty for the concept that Ted would develop stronger feelings for 
her had never crossed her mind, and yet Kurisumasu herself had on 
several occasions used the pretence of Ted to ward off admirers in her 
little village that would otherwise have shown more friendliness than 
Kurisumasu was entirely comfortable with. 

How could they ever hope to understand that all of Kurisumasu&#39;s love, 
her hopes, her dreams, even her very self, had gone from the world 
together with a tiny dying light torn forcibly from Kurau&#39;s human form 
after saving the world ten years ago? Could they ever comprehend the 
reason that Kurisumasu was still alive when death had seemed the only 
end to her pain was that she had taken that flickering light into her 
own chest before it could vanish completely, and that somewhere in the 
vastness of the world within herself, her beloved Pair, Kurisumasu&#39;s 
Kurau, lay sleeping deeply, leaving Kurisumasu with the faint hope that 
one day before Kurisumasu&#39;s human life was over Kurau would awaken, 
restored, and come back to her. 

Ten years had passed since then. Ten years during which Kurisumasu had 
been alone, not even able to sense a trace of Kurau&#39;s presence within. 

A Rynax that loses its Pair invariably goes insane and dies. That was 
the truth as she had learned it alongside Kurau in those days. And yet 
Kurau had withstood ten years of solitude before Kurisumasu had awakened 
into the world and she had, although lonely, not been damaged... 
Kurisumasu felt she had no right to complain that she had waited for ten 
years for Kurau also, and she did her best to put on a brave face and 
endure, but it was getting to be so difficult. 

So very difficult. Kurisumasu did not know how much longer she could 
withstand this without ending her pain one way or the other. 

Tears dripped from her cheeks to send tiny ripples across the lake as 
Kurisumasu scrunched up to hold her knees tight to her chest while 
sinking in the air until the hem of her thin white nightgown brushed the 
water&#39;s surface. She allowed herself to fall back until she lay prone in 
the air just above the water, the fireflies dancing above her now 
dimming light. 

Inside Kurisumasu&#39;s soul screamed with such desperation she could taste 
it in the back of her mouth, and sobs wracked her slender form. 

&quot;Come back to me Kurau&quot; 

Kurisumasu closed her eyes to the light and wept as the heartbroken 
child she had been that time had done, her entire body shaking violently 
with each deep-wracked sob. 

She did not see her own light flicker and twist until it suddenly flared 
brightly. 

She did not see how the light drew together to one incredibly brilliant 
point just above her chest. 

Kurisumasu could however not miss the sensation that had her slender 
back arch until her long black hair kissed the water&#39;s surface as that 
brilliant point of light wrestled itself free of her. 

This feeling. She knew this feeling. 

Coming upright to face the light Kurisumasu was wordlessly weeping once 
more although the tears were not grieving ones, she watched in unbridled 
joy as it grew in intensity and size until... the light faded to match 
her own, and there she was. 

Kurau, naked and glowing, looking exactly as she had ten years earlier, 
tall and strong, her black hair short and her smile open and friendly, 
and... the most important thing of all... those blue eyes looked at 
Kurisumasu with all the love of the world brimming in them. Kurisumasu 
felt her soul become whole again. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve kept you waiting, Kurisumasu.&quot; The warm, somewhat 
deeper-pitched voice washed over Kurisumasu as a caress to her heart and 
a promise to heal. &quot;I&#39;m home now.&quot; 

With a strangled sound halfway between a sob and a laugh Kurisumasu 
threw herself into Kurau&#39;s arms, clinging to her desperately, needing 
the warmth and the strong embrace right then to reassure her of what she 
already knew. Kurau was with her again. While hiding her face into 
Kurau&#39;s shoulder Kurisumasu managed to gasp. 

&quot;Welcome home, Kurau.&quot; 

And around them the lights continued their twirling dance over the 
water.</pre>
