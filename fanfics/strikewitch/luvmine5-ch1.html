<pre>I never had love. 

Oh I&#39;ve flirted aplenty, and been flirted with, but beyond that, the 
actual emotions... no, I have never had love. I figure that I&#39;m young, 
things like that will come to me in time, when something in me is ready 
for it and there is a place for that love in my life. It is not 
something to stress oneself over. 

Still, I&#39;ve found myself thinking a lot lately that it would be nice to 
have, to share that sort of thing with someone. I admit that I&#39;ve looked 
at some of my more obviously amorous friends and felt the occasional 
pang of envy... how nice to belong together with someone. 

That is probably a big part of the reason why it gets on my nerves when 
certain people waste it, squander what they&#39;ve been given by dancing 
around the issue and one another, saying nothing. I kind of want to yell 
at them to get on with it already. I know I&#39;m the irresponsible one of 
the team, but even I know to have my fun today because tomorrow I might 
get shot out of the sky for good. Even fool&#39;s luck runs out someday. 

Such was the case with my two oldest and dearest friends, until recently 
that is.  

I had seen it coming for some time, and it wasn&#39;t particularly 
surprising that once a certain person managed to put her hang-ups to 
rest, my dear old former teacher was going to get caught dead in her 
sights. Which is all fine and good, they&#39;re made for one another and 
I&#39;ve been expecting this for almost as long as I&#39;ve known them, but 
little miss combat genius has her ponytails tied on too tight to catch a 
clue even if it is hammered into her skull. It was almost painfully 
embarrassing to watch. 

After some time of this kind of behaviour even the kid started sighing 
and rolling her eyes when those two got going, yes they&#39;re both so 
sugary cute it makes my teeth itch, but something just had to give. I 
was sorely tempted to intervene, but none of my ingenious plans were 
likely to work, after all, how does one manage to lock two women into a 
small room together if one somehow has the ability to read your mind and 
the other the strength to tear down walls like they&#39;re tissue paper? 

I was going to have to plan it all very carefully and be extra sneaky. 

Thankfully I never needed to implement any of my cunning plans as my 
friends saw fit to come to their senses just before I would have been 
forced to flip a coin for which one of before mentioned plans to put in 
motion. We were supposed to wait for the kid while she was getting 
ready, and I was busy describing my war achievements to this pretty 
little thing that was absolutely fascinated by me &#150; what can I say, I&#39;m 
so charming it&#39;s sinful &#150; while a certain couple in the making quite 
suspiciously retreated to a nearby balcony. 

For all I know they were out there flirting their Strikers off while 
alone, after all I took my time to finish the conversation with pretty 
before stealthily sneaking up to check on them, but at least I got there 
for the important part. 

When I first spied them they were standing close together, good old 
teach looking almost mortally uncomfortable with her shoulder providing 
someone else&#39;s headrest, but completely unable to move since her arm was 
in quite a secure double-armed hold. As giggle-worthy as that sight was, 
it was also fairly par for the course, so I was going to just step out 
and strike up conversation when something happened. 

At first it seemed to be the usual 
let-me-straighten-your-crooked-hair-by-embracing-you,-pressing-my-body-shamelessly-against-yours-while-staring-deeply-into-your-eyes 
thing &#150; I need to come up with a good name for this manoeuvre, it is 
really quite effective apparently &#150; but just as they were about to draw 
apart my old buddy surprised me and possibly herself as well.  

Even though I could tell that her ears were bright red from where I was 
standing, she had some spurt of boldness from I don&#39;t know where and 
yanked our other friend back into a close clinch, and then she kissed 
her. Just like that, and not a short little peck of a kiss either. 

They drew back far enough to stare at one another, looking about as 
shocked as I felt. It took me a long moment to comprehend that it was 
real, but by the time I could finally process it I was fully ready to 
run out to the nearest populated street, wave flags around while 
proclaiming to all that heard that THEY FINALLY DID IT, but I restrained 
myself. See, I do have discipline. 

I would like to say that at this point they leaned in and kissed each 
other again, however it was more like they fell upon one another like a 
pair of starving wolves. I stopped my internal cheering and celebrating 
enough to stare at them completely dumbfounded for another good long 
moment, while they were getting increasingly heated. It is not something 
that is easy to do, but I swear they made me blush. 

When they upturned that table in their search for a convenient and 
friendly nearby wall, breaking whatever that clay ornament on it was 
supposed to be in the process, the paralysis spell deviously thrown on 
me broke, and I made a very hasty strategic withdrawal. I then wedged a 
chair against the door from the inside and, a quick dash down the 
corridor and back later, managed to write a sign in nice, big block 
letters that said OUT OF ORDER, DO NOT DISTURB that I hung on that 
chair. 

After that I strolled off to make sure the kid was kept occupied until 
her big sister, and her sister&#39;s blushing brand new girlfriend, decided 
to come looking for us. All in all I&#39;d say that was pretty nice of me, 
so I don&#39;t see why I am the one currently locked out on the balcony of 
our apartment with nothing but a blanket and a wooden recliner for 
company. 

Sure, I tease them as much as I can every chance I get... and I did kind 
of end up spilling everything to these two other friends of ours, who 
thought it was hilarious and in turn told several other people, but 
still! To lock me out here and then go to bed themselves, is that any 
way to treat a friend? 

Ah well, its not so bad. It is a warm night, and those stars look quite 
amazing from here. I think I&#39;ll just lie here and continue to dream of 
that elusive someday.  

The day when I too will know what it is like to love. </pre>
