<pre>The first time we met I looked into her eyes and had the strangest 
feeling that I had come home. 

At the time I had travelled very far and for quite some time, my home 
was enemy territory and the location of my family was unknown, although 
I thankfully had just been informed that they were alive. The part of 
the military that had evacuated my group from the smoking ruins of my 
part of the country had quickly packed me up and sent me onward to the 
front where I was going to fight whether I wanted to or not. No choice 
had ever been given me, and I was scared of what I would find at my 
destination. 

They had shown me files of the rest of the squadron, with names and 
pictures of those currently at the base, but I was too anxious to focus 
on them. I clutched my toy, the only piece of the past I managed to 
save, to my chest and tried not to feel quite so numb as I was passed 
from one type of vehicle to another until finally we had arrived. 

I had seen her picture but it did her no justice. The moment I looked up 
from the tarmac I looked right into eyes such a dark and stormy 
blue-grey that they immediately made me think of rain back home, before 
the destruction. I could even hear the sound of gentle raindrops on the 
earth when she stepped up to take my hand in hers. 

It would take some time before I realized that the sound I heard was 
actually the sound of her heart. 

She charmed me from the start, and I don&#39;t think she meant to. She was, 
and is, just so brave and strong and kind and wonderful that to know her 
is to love her. I did not think of love back then, it did not occur to 
me and I did not know at the time that I was old enough to experience 
such things. I did however know from that very first moment that we 
belonged together, like two pieces of a puzzle made to fit together 
seamlessly. 

There was something about her that drew me to her, all the time and 
regardless of where she was or what she was doing. It amused me to think 
that we were like these tiny magnets I had used to play with when I was 
little, how they would immediately snap to one another when I released 
them. We were drawn together in much the same way, and although back 
then I had no conscious thoughts of romance I did still have a longing 
to be that seamless, perfect whole together with her. 

She helped me fit in with our comrades and took care of me, and life was 
good despite the battles we had to fight and despite that I did not know 
where mama and papa where. I grew more confident, stronger and surer in 
my abilities, and once our leaders decided that I was strong enough and 
skilled enough they began sending me out at night, alone. That I did not 
like. 

I love the night, but after meeting her I no longer like to be alone. I 
want to be with her. 

Thoughts of her kept me company when she herself could not, and my 
spirit always felt lighter as I returned to base with the early dawn for 
I knew she would be there. I would go to her door to press myself 
against it and use my abilities to hear and sense her through it. I 
would stay like that until the steady sounds of her slumber relaxed me 
enough that I too could sleep, and then I would fumble my way over to my 
own room and my own solitary bed. 

I could not give words to my joy when eventually that door opened to me 
and I could lie down next to her. She is so warm, even in the middle of 
the coldest night, and I always long with every fibre of my being to 
press up against her in whatever way I may, to melt into her. 

There were reasons and excuses to begin with, for why I would sleep in 
her bed rather than my own. Many times she told me in a voice she 
struggled so hard to make exasperated yet never really succeeded, that I 
should not mistake her room for my own when I went to bed. Just as I 
always knew that she did not mind my presence there at all I am sure she 
always knew that I did not find my way to her bed by mistake. Sometimes 
it took the very last of my strength to get to her, but it was always my 
intention to reach her side. 

Eventually, finally, she let me know that the excuses were no longer 
necessary. I was let inside her room to stay, and we allowed ourselves 
to stop pretending. 

From that night onward she has held me close as we sleep, every single 
time. With my ear so close to her heart I did not need to use my 
abilities, I could clearly hear the wonderful sound of her heartbeat and 
together with her breathing it lulls me to peaceful sleep better than 
any lullaby ever could. 

Since I was a little girl my favourite song was always the one papa 
wrote about the rain, but no longer. The sound I treasure most of all is 
her beautiful voice, and the most incredible song I know is the sound of 
her heart. I hope to hear both for the rest of my life, and one day I 
intend to use the piano help me make her hear at least a fraction of 
what I do when with her. 

A few days after I moved into her room we shared our first kiss. I had 
wanted her to kiss me for some time, but did not know how one goes about 
initiating such a thing. I have always had difficulty putting words to 
my longing, but she understands me anyway. 

The first brush of those soft, silken lips changed me. I, who up until 
then had been largely oblivious to anything that was not her, I found 
myself taking note of my surroundings suddenly, jealously making sure no 
one would come too close or be too familiar with her. I also found 
myself blushing oddly from her touch or her closeness at times. 

Then our group was disbanded and our friends were sent away to places we 
were not to follow. 

It had never occurred to me that if for some reason our team would be 
retired or my specific services no longer needed, I would be taken away. 
It never crossed my mind that she would be recalled to her home without 
me, and I would be taken somewhere far away in what remains of my 
homeland, my opinion of the location as unasked for as before. 

Our leader intervened, made the arrangements so that I could continue to 
stay with the one that was everything to me. She pulled us aside during 
the confusion near the end of our stay at the base and explained it to 
us, officially handing me over into the care of my love. She seemed 
surprised when I hugged her in thanks, and after that a pair of strong 
warm arms wrapped around me, clearly determined not to let me go. I 
found I was perfectly happy to leave the base. 

Her home, when we reached it, was and is to me like she herself; simply 
home. Everything is very similar to where I grew up, and I discovered to 
my surprise that I had missed the colder, clearer night skies of the 
north. I found myself looking forward to odd little things, like the 
scent of pine or the sound of snow crunching under my feet. 

Most of all I love her home because it is hers, and because it is I 
wished to discover everything about it. She took me to all her favourite 
places, showed me where she had played as a little girl and where she 
liked to go as she grew older. We would often take walks in the 
moonlight or go on nightly flights underneath the stars just because we 
felt like it. It was wonderful. 

We eventually took that final step in our relationship in a secluded 
glen at one of her favourite secret places, where the ground was covered 
in thick, soft moss and we were far away from any prying eyes. It was 
perfect and beautiful and she was so happy she cried afterwards, while I 
held her close and swore to myself that nothing will ever take me away 
from her. 

The word love had not yet passed either of our lips at that time, though 
I did not quite grasp the impact of such words then, content as I was 
that we showed our love for one another in actions instead. It took but 
a little while longer before I would be made aware of the importance of 
words. 

Since we first met we had been mutually struggling to learn the other&#39;s 
native language. Although she claims that I speak her language fairly 
well she sounds funny when speaking mine, still my native tongue has 
never sounded quite as charming as when spoken in her slightly lilting 
way. 

Somehow I had gotten unaccustomed to hearing my own language spoken 
since I crossed the borders for the first time, and so when I moved 
through the rooms and hallways of our home to hear a familiar voice 
haltingly speak in that tongue the words themselves did not register 
with me. Curious as to why my love was speaking this way when I was not 
with her I followed the sound to our bedroom door without her noticing 
me. 

At first I could not comprehend what she was doing. 

As far as I could tell she was addressing my papa, even though she of 
course was alone in the room and my father still at some unknown 
location a nation away, and she paced as she was doing it. After a few 
circuits back and forth across the bedroom floor, arms moving wildly to 
emphasize something from time to time and head shaking occasionally, I 
finally realized it.  

She was practicing a speech she intended for when she would meet my 
papa, a speech in which she with slightly broken words and funny 
pronunciations would declare to him her love for me, that her intentions 
where I was concerned were honourable, and that she would take good care 
of me and cherish me always. 

By the time she had gotten to the part where she explained that she 
would marry me if only she could find a place in the world where such a 
thing was allowed, I stumbled into the room with tears in my eyes. 

Not noticing me at first she continued her conversation with my absent 
papa, assuring him that she would be a good wife for me, then she 
stopped and had a little argument with herself whether she should say 
wife or husband, and that is when she noticed me. 

She blushed a bright red as I threw my arms around her and told her that 
I love her too. For good measure I said it in all three languages before 
the dam burst and I clung to her, burying my head into her shoulder. 

It was my time to cry, overcome with joy, and hers to hold and offer 
loving comfort. Since then we have both made sure that words follow 
actions and no part of this wonderful, beautiful love we share goes 
unexpressed. 

One day I am sure she will get her chance to make her case to my papa, 
if that is what she wants. It makes little difference, although I am 
sure he would appreciate it, for the opinions and decisions of others 
does not matter. She has my answer already, in a way she has had my 
answer since that first time our eyes met. 

We belong together. 

And I am completely and utterly hers. </pre>
