<h1>Waltz on the Moon</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strikewitch/index.html">Strike Witches</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ryuchan.html">Carola "Ry√ªchan" Eriksson</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was only natural that someone that loves Sanya should celebrate her 
birthday. 

I said those words to Miyafuji as we all heard the notes of Sanya&#39;s 
father&#39;s piano reach her on her special day from so far away, but I&#39;m 
sure Miyafuji didn&#39;t get what I was really saying. Just like she didn&#39;t 
get what I meant when I spoke of how watching Sanya sing, naked by the 
water and painted by the setting sun, made my heart beat faster and 
ache. 

That&#39;s ok though. Miyafuji is a good person, but all the same I&#39;d rather 
she didn&#39;t look at my Sanya in that light. 

It would have helped if Miyafuji had been aware enough to catch some of 
my hints that I wanted her to give me some alone time with Sanya that 
day or night, although with how things happened I guess that was a bit 
much to ask. Either way, this is why I now, one month later, have made a 
special request of my superior officers. 

...let me engrave into my mind to never ever ask Major Sakamoto for 
favours which have to do with romance, ever again. That way lies madness 
and public humiliation, not to mention that despite her tactical 
brilliance she is incredibly thick-headed when it comes to romance, so 
she just will not get what you are trying to explain and deny your 
request anyway. 

Commander Minna is by far easier on one&#39;s pride and blood pressure, also 
she can be very classy and understanding of things like these when she 
wants to be. Why I even thought to ask Major Sakamoto first I have no 
idea. 

In the end I got my permission, with a few amendments in case of an 
attack by the Neuroi of course, and also to my surprise an accomplice. I 
may just have roughly an hour for what I have planned, but with this I 
am sure to get it as close to perfect as I can make it. 

Thankfully we are in one of the &#39;safe&#39; periods right now, when no Neuroi 
attack is expected for quite a while. My tarot cards have also told me 
that tonight will be safe and auspicious for matters of the heart. 
Trusting my luck not to be that bad I carefully pat the longish but 
narrow canister tied next to my holster and grin at Sanya. 

&quot;Eila?&quot; Sanya is worried, her brows furrow slightly and I notice the 
twitch in the hand where she usually carries her rocket launcher. &quot;Why 
are we going out on patrol unarmed?&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll be back for them in a bit.&quot; I grin at her and take 
her hand. &quot;It&#39;s alright, we&#39;ve got what we need for right now. Trust 
me?&quot; 

Her reply is quiet but her answering grip on my hand steady, and to my 
absolute delight the lights around her head - my angel&#39;s halo - changes 
colour from green to blue to finally a soft purple. She trusts me. 

With a tug and an even wider grin I set us off down the runway, 
launching into the night sky. As we climb rapidly through the cold air 
towards the other side of the clouds our fingers entwine, I fight the 
urge to do somersaults of happiness as it is Sanya that made the move to 
link our fingers this way. 

All too soon we break through the clouds to the other side, to this 
strange peaceful and silent other world of night that belongs to Sanya 
and that she will let me visit with her. The moonlight paints the clouds 
now below us to the palest silver and white, much like Sanya&#39;s hair and 
skin. She was truly born to fly here. 

The sight of her enchants me, and besotted I stare at her for a long 
moment, forgetting what I had planned until I notice her confused look 
and that her lights are turning more blue. I sketch a feather-light kiss 
on her hand before letting her go, untying the cylinder from my belt. 

&quot;Sanya&quot; I begin as I twist the top part of the canister. &quot;Your birthday 
was a month ago, and though I wanted to do something special I couldn&#39;t 
at the time.&quot; I get the top open by feel alone, as I can&#39;t look away 
from the wide and shining green eyes before me. &quot;So this is late, but I 
hope you&#39;ll like it anyway.&quot; 

&quot;Happy birthday Sanya&quot;  

I pull the single long-stemmed red rose from the container and hand it 
to her as elegantly as I can manage. I made sure to remove all the 
thorns beforehand so that there was no risk of hurting her delicate 
hands, which I am glad I did now as Sanya, whether aware of it or not, 
is touching the rose caressingly. There is a slight blush on her cheeks 
and the light has changed again, deepened to a charming shade of pale 
pink. She inhales the flower&#39;s scent, then turn large and slightly 
tearful eyes on me. 

&quot;Thank you Eila.&quot; Then she is hugging me tight, face tucked into my 
neck. I hug her back in silence for a long moment. 

&quot;Sanya, do me a favour?&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot; Her answer is immediate, and when she draws back slightly to meet 
my eyes hers are absolutely serious. I am so in love with her I could 
cry. 

&quot;See if you can get in a radio broadcast from around here?&quot; She looks 
slightly confused again but do as I have asked, while I smile at her and 
hope my accomplice has done what she promised. Almost instantly the 
sound comes, surprisingly clear and free of static, of a woman&#39;s sultry 
voice in a slow romantic song. 

I carefully take the rose from her hands and put it back into the 
cylinder before attaching it to the side of Sanya&#39;s belt. Her eyes never 
leave mine. Then I take her hand, bow slightly and with my best smile 
ask &quot;May I have this dance?&quot; 

I may, and we fit together perfectly, twirling away in a waltz on top of 
clouds so white they remind me of the snow back home. I lead and she 
moves with me, spinning, sailing, gliding in a dance no-one has danced 
before us, alone in our magical world. As one song ends another begins, 
but we do not stop in between them. Sanya&#39;s cheeks are flushed and her 
smile is wide and happy, the music we dance to occasionally accompanied 
by her tinkling laughter. 

When finally we slow down our dance has taken us high in the air, so 
that the fullness of the moon appears to be embracing us. As if we had 
agreed upon it out loud we pull one another closer, her arms around my 
neck and mine around her tiny waist. Her soft humming tickles my ear as 
we dance oh so slowly cheek to cheek. 

Eventually the song comes to an end, and silence replaces it. I know 
that this means that our time is running out, but that is a distant 
concern at best as I am still standing with Sanya in my arms, bathed in 
moonlight in our black and white world. 

I look at her and feel so overcome by my emotions that I know they will 
be plainly visible on my face and in my eyes. I can tell by the look in 
hers that she sees it, so it is time to speak up. 

&quot;I love you, Sanya.&quot; 

My angel gasps and her eyes grow even wider. She blushes so adorably and 
amazingly enough the lights around her swiftly turn a deep red in hue, a 
colour I am sure they have never been before. A slender hand cups my 
face and she whispers something to me in Orussian that I do not know, 
yet understand anyway. 

Then we are kissing, sweetly, deeply and passionately. A vague notion of 
not overwhelming Sanya with too much too soon flickers through my mind 
very briefly, but Sanya has no such concerns, her arms wrapped tightly 
around my neck and her hands guiding my head in our continued exchange. 
I couldn&#39;t stop now even if I wanted to. 

Sanya loves me. 

And here in the moonlit embrace of an angel, I am the closest to heaven. 
 

---------------------------------------------------------- 
 

From her vantage point at the base Minna-Dietlinde Wilcke shakes her 
head in amusement at the kissing young couple outlined against the full 
moon. She had stopped broadcasting music for this little lovers 
rendezvous some time ago, yet the two girls did not look like they were 
about to come up for air anytime soon. 

She really should signal them to come retrieve their weapons and go on 
patrol by now, but a few minutes extra wouldn&#39;t hurt any. Maybe she was 
just a romantic at heart after all, but if the Neuroi could have the 
decency not to interrupt the young couple finding some happiness in 
their bleak world, well, then Minna would at the very least give them a 
few minutes. 

As she carefully removes the record from the gramophone she wonders if 
she will have the time to bring out the camera to commemorate the event 
on Eila and Sanya&#39;s behalf. If nothing else a picture like that should 
provide for some... interesting... reactions. 

Smiling Minna casts another glance at the silhouetted young couple. 

Hmm.  

Maybe just a few minutes more... </pre>
