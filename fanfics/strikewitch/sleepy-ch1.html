<h1>Sleepy</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strikewitch/index.html">Strike Witches</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ryuchan.html">Carola "Ry√ªchan" Eriksson</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Sleepy... so sleepy. Eyes are closing, can&#39;t focus. 

Eila? Eila is... where? Want to go to Eila. Need to. But my eyes won&#39;t 
open. 

Aa, Eila is there. That is her heartbeat. Steady. Wonderful. Safe. 

There is an obstacle in my way, can&#39;t get through. It is hard, but I 
manage to open one eye, just a little. 

Ah, a door. It has a handle, too. Good. I get it open on my second try. 

There is Eila. Eila sleeps, I can hear her breathing. She sleeps on her 
bed, big bed, soft bed, warm bed where I need to sleep too. 

The room is swivelling and I am spinning. Eila&#39;s bed is quite far away, 
and now my eye closes again. But that is ok, I can see Eila anyway. 

I can always see Eila anyway. Inside. 

Feet are heavy, clumsy, and hands are slow. My clothes are being 
difficult when they should be obedient and come off quickly. I want to 
be with my Eila already. 

There, got the last of it off, now to bed. Is there something I&#39;ve 
forgotten? Doesn&#39;t matter, there is the mattress under my hands. 

You are so bright Eila, even when my eyes are closed. You can always 
guide me. 

There, this is warm and safe and perfect. This is Eila. This is home. I 
curl up so close that I can feel her breathing, and I am where I belong. 
This is what I need. Now I can sleep. 

Eila? I made it back from the darkness again tonight. 

I made it back home. To you. </pre>
