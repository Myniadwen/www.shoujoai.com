<h1>A Love that is Mine 1</h1>

<pre>You were not my first love.  

I had loved before you, and I had done so deeply and happily. When that 
love ended in heartbreak from the horrors of war it was too much for me 
to take, and I hid this bleeding heart of mine away behind walls and 
masks. No-one was allowed to enter into that inner sanctum, no matter 
how close my friends and comrades were or how well I loved them. 

You snuck up on me unawares, slipped past my defences so slowly and 
surely that I never noticed it until it was too late to protect this 
vulnerable core of me from the force of nature that is you. 

The irony of it all is that you never noticed. To you we were, are, 
shall ever be, close and steadfast friends and no more. We grew together 
as a unit, our joint leadership fusing us together in ways I have often 
in my mind likened to the way a married couple grows together over time; 
I have heard us described as the kind mother and the stern but 
benevolent father to our group of young warrior girls, and it has 
suggested to me that perhaps I was not the only one to draw this 
parallel. 

How many times over the years that span our togetherness have I, 
consciously and not, likened what you do and what you are to me to that 
of a husband? It was but an amused observation at first, a comment to 
myself regarding the utter loyalty which you gave me so freely, but 
somewhere, sometime when I let my guard down for just a moment, you 
stepped in and took his place in my dreams. Those sweet forbidden dreams 
in which I no longer dreamt of him as my husband but of you, tall and 
strong and smiling, holding me as we danced in a world where war and 
painful things had no place.  

Those dreams in which you were mine. 

In troubled times you were my only counsel, and I know you in ways 
no-one else does. I flat out refused to love you for the longest time, 
as if I could simply will the emotions away, did you know that? I did 
not want to love, did not want to open myself to such pain ever again. 

In the end I could not deny it though, such things always come to the 
surface one way or the other. It was too late by then, for me, for us; 
you looked at me with warmth, compassion and sympathy, yes even pity, 
and in your silence confirmed that you knew and did not feel the same. 
By then I knew it too, that your heart had been claimed as unexpectedly 
as mine, but I needed this moment for my weakness. I needed to know that 
you acknowledged me, and to see your back when you turned and walked 
away. 

I shall always love you, I know this much. There is a sacred place in my 
heart where I have enshrined my feelings for you, and they will remain 
there, pristine and evergreen, forever. But I have moved on, and my 
heart is no longer the bleeding and useless thing it was before I loved 
you. Though it frightens me greatly, I am ready to love and be loved, 
and for this I thank you. You were what I needed when I needed you. 

Although it still stung somewhat right after my heart had been laid open 
and so gently yet firmly been rejected, I was filled with a sense of 
starting fresh, like a morning after a night of rain. The heavy clouds 
that had shrouded my eyes had cleared, and I could see clearly now. 

At long last I could see her, well and truly. For so long she had been 
one of my closest friends and allies, second only to you although there 
was an ocean of difference in that small step alone, and I can honestly 
say that I have loved her dearly all this time. It was not the love I 
once held for him, now so coloured in pain that I cannot recall its 
original flavour, nor was it the struggling reluctant love that pierced 
my heart and made me ache when I looked at you, and in honesty I think 
it shall never be like that. 

I was unprepared for it when I found myself looking at her and was 
immersed in a flood of warmth, soft and soothing and filling every part 
of my being, making me feel more genuinely joyful and complete than I 
had in so very long. You are similar in many ways, like you she is 
strong and stoic on the surface yet so very sweet beneath, but the way I 
feel about her is not at all similar to how I felt for you. With you I 
wanted you to hold me, I longed for the safety of being in your arms. 
With her I long to hold her, to wrap my arms around her and find those 
small, gentle and peaceful moments together. 

I am grateful to you for that. Had you not opened my heart I would not 
be able to love her now, and loving her is something I can envision 
myself doing for my future. She doesn&#39;t know it yet, she is not quite 
ready for me yet, but I am patient and do not mind the wait. The signs 
are already there, in her shy glances, her blushes and her warm smiles. 
It won&#39;t be long at all until I will find her looking back at me, with 
eyes that hold only love and acceptance. Soon she will reach out for me 
for no other reason than to touch me, to hold my hand, and until then I 
shall savour the sensation of this sweet falling. 

You were not my first love, nor will you be my last.  

We shared a time in our lives that shall always be important to me, and 
you set me free. I will never regret my love for you, and I shall always 
be grateful that our time together allows me to love her, to accept her 
and whatever our future might have in store for us. I wish you the same 
freedom and hope for your happiness, though I suspect that it will be 
thrust upon you whether you would accept it or not. 

As for myself, I step forward stronger and more complete than before. I 
am confident that I can take what the future holds for me, filled with 
anticipation as I am for the day very soon when I will finally know the 
warmth of another&#39;s heart. 

The day when I will finally have a love that is truly mine. </pre>
