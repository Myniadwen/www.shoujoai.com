<h1>The One that Loves You</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strikewitch/index.html">Strike Witches</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ryuchan.html">Carola "Ry√ªchan" Eriksson</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Honestly, everything about you is so unexpected. When we first met I 
never expected that you would become so important to me. That I would 
spend my days and nights taking care of you, or that our lives would be 
so inexplicably intertwined. 

I never expected to fall in love with you. 

How quickly and readily my life, my very being, moulded itself around 
you. I didn&#39;t even notice it at the time, it felt like the most natural 
thing in the world, being with you. We gravitate towards and around one 
another, bound together with ties that go deeper than I think even we 
ourselves can fully understand yet. 

I have wondered sometimes what you are thinking and feeling about us. I 
have never asked though. You are so young and we have time for you to 
realise for yourself how we are all but lovers already... or so I used 
to think. Perhaps I was just making excuses for not making my feelings 
clear to you and risk rejection, maybe I was just afraid all along. 

Don&#39;t you see me Sanya? I am the one that always stands next to you. 

Until recently I thought that you needed me, that you sought me out, 
sought my help, my care, my companionship. It seemed to me that you were 
helpless without me, that you were so needy and required me to dote on 
you just to get through everyday life. That you needed me to help you 
with the mundane little things, washing, clothing, keeping you fed... 
you even find your way into my bed at night, as if you can&#39;t stand to be 
apart for even that long. 

How wrong I was. It isn&#39;t you who are the needy one, the one that sought 
me out, oh no. It was always the reverse. 

I stay beside you because there is nowhere else in the world I would 
rather be. Where you go I follow, like the ocean follows the moon. I 
wonder, do you even notice me, trailing your steps? 

Everything changed when she came. I didn&#39;t even pay that much attention 
to her, she was just a new recruit, the new kid, young and cute and 
terribly na&iuml;ve. If anything I think I considered her the Major&#39;s girl, 
seeing as how the two of them seemed to have gotten rather close pretty 
fast. That was before she was put on night duty with the two of us. 

Miyafuji is a sweet girl, I can&#39;t refute that, and she is very likeable 
too. Somewhat dense about some things, I think, and for all her gifts 
and her growing skill she&#39;s not a soldier. It might not always be very 
apparent but I am every bit as much an ingrained soldier as Barkhorn or 
Major Sakamoto herself, for all that I sometimes play the part of the 
rogue &#150; the military mindset and its discipline are imprinted into my 
spine.  

Of course you can always make me lose my cool. 

Miyafuji reached out to you, and to my shock and horror, charmed you 
completely. Do you think that I do not notice how you smile and blush in 
response to her? That I do not see you following her with your gaze, or 
how differently you react to her? Of course I do, I notice everything 
about you. 

Each time it cuts a little deeper into my heart, and I bleed a little 
more. 

I&#39;ve struggled with it, but ultimately there is one thing that must 
always be true: I am the one that loves you, that would do anything for 
you. Even if that means seeing you find happiness with someone else. 

So I&#39;ve tried to make her pay attention to you when I can. I could sing 
your praise for hours and it would not mean as much as a single 
encouraging word from her, I realise that. It hurts, of course it does, 
but at least I do what I can. She&#39;ll notice soon, you&#39;ll see. 

You have rivals for her attention, amazingly enough. I&#39;ll never 
understand how anyone can look at the wonder that is you and then see 
anything else at all, but although it angers me a little, I suppose 
Miyafuji can&#39;t help that she is that dense. With women throwing 
themselves at her left and right &#150; or rather yanking at her I suppose &#150; 
it might not be easy to notice your interest while you remain quiet and 
unmoving. 

I&#39;ll encourage you, if you can overcome just a little of your shyness 
there is no way she or anyone else could avoid noticing you. Once she 
sees you, truly sees you, she can&#39;t help but fall at your feet. Who can? 

I&#39;m a fool, of course. Just a fool would try to get the girl she loves 
together with someone else. It is not like it didn&#39;t occur to me though, 
that doing nothing, letting Miyafuji get yanked around by those other 
girls until one of them made an honest claim, would mean that I did not 
have to lose you. But you see, I could not bear for you to be in pain, 
or worse, cry over her. 

Should the day arrive that you came to me crying over her, I would 
probably lose it altogether. I don&#39;t doubt that I would beat Miyafuji to 
a bloody pulp for hurting you, regardless of the repercussions. Ha, I 
wonder what would happen first, Sakamoto and Barkhorn beating me into a 
pale smear on the runway, or the Commander having me drawn and 
quartered? Not that it would matter. 

What then would I do if things go your way and Miyafuji loves you? Would 
I be able to take it, to watch you two together, to watch you with her 
doing all the things we used to and more? All while I continue on, alone 
and without you. Am I that strong? 

No. I&#39;m not, I know that. I would probably end up locking myself into my 
room when not on duty, except that would only make me feel worse 
wouldn&#39;t it? After all, your presence is in everything in here; that is 
your mug, your chair... your side of the bed. 

You always sneak into my bed at the end of your duty shift, and I&#39;ve 
always pretended to grumble and say that it was &#145;only for today&#39;, though 
never so that you could hear me. I still say that, though these days I 
say it directed at myself; it is only for today that you are with me, 
only for today that you are next to me, warm, beautiful and 
breathtaking. 

The thought that tomorrow you might be in someone else&#39;s bed, someone 
else&#39;s arms, just kills me and I can&#39;t breathe. Nothing in this world 
could ever hurt as much as losing you. 

Except... it was just a dream, wasn&#39;t it? You were never mine. But you 
know, Sanya? If ever you would look to me, if you could ever consider 
me... 

I would be yours. Completely. </pre>
