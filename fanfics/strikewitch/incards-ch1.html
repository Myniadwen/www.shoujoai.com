<h1>In the Cards</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strikewitch/index.html">Strike Witches</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ryuchan.html">Carola "Ry√ªchan" Eriksson</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The room is covered in darkness, broken only by the small circle of 
light here at the table. The small candles, one to my left and two to my 
right, illuminates the cards I&#146;ve spread across the table surface and 
manage to light up her face just so, giving her an unearthly, floating, 
appearance. 

We&#146;re really supposed to be sleeping, and in Sanya&#146;s room at that, but 
as neither of us are quite ready to sleep yet I suggested we stay in my 
room today instead. I wonder when our superior officers will finally 
clue in to the fact that Sanya sleeps in my room and not her own? The 
only time she stays there is when we are ordered to in preparation for 
the night shift. 

To pass the time I suggested we do a reading on Sanya, and that is why 
the candles are lit. As much as I wish it was for some more auspicious 
reason, like a candlelit dinner for two or something likewise romantic, 
I know well enough that this is as close as I&#146;ll get. 

The first card I drew was the Fool, and if I had any doubts my Sight 
clearly told me that it was the symbol for her, for Sanya&#146;s path or 
quest. All in all not a bad start, and I explained that to her as she 
watched with curiosity how I turned the cards. 

Next I found strong friendship and acceptance, and while my Sight said 
nothing about it I would assume that it refers to me. My own feelings 
aside I do try to be as good a friend to Sanya as I am at all able. 

After that came cards that spoke to me of a challenge she must face in 
order to have change, something for which she would need strength, faith 
and courage to obtain. Originally I intended this reading to be fake, 
just a tool for me to use to help Sanya get the courage to approach 
Miyafuji with, but that changed right away. I need not come up with a 
fake reading when the real one is saying all the things I had intended 
to. 

There is someone in Sanya&#146;s life that she has deep feelings of romantic 
nature for, and to win that person Sanya will have to find the strength 
to be brave, to take a chance. She will have the support of a good and 
accepting friend, and if she dares to go through with it the signs are 
in favour of success. 

My palms are sweating and I am nauseous as we have gotten this far. I 
might have intended to do this on purpose, but I really did not want it 
to be true. I love Sanya after all. 

Something will happen, something painful and difficult, but if endured 
it will bring positive change and... I lift the final card and turn it, 
but as I do it falls from my fingers, landing in the centre of the 
spread, face up. 

The Lovers. 

My Sight hits me, harder than I ever thought it could, only not the way 
it is supposed to. Instead of showing me how to interpret the cards laid 
out before me the present is yanked away from me, replaced with a vision 
so real and vivid that I can feel it. Taste it. Touch it. 

Sanya. 

Sanya, naked and beautiful, her skin flushed and her hair messy as she 
writhes, gasping, in the arms of her lover. I see her through that 
person&#146;s eyes, but that is not all. I feel every sensation as if I was 
truly there, loving her. 

Her skin is so hot and smooth against mine, the taste of it strangely 
electric as I move my lips against the pulse in her neck. She gasps as I 
do, her hands gripping onto me so hard I feel the bite of her nails 
though they don&#146;t hurt. Nothing could hurt now, this is incredible, this 
is maddening, this is heaven; I rock with her until suddenly her body 
goes tense and arches beneath me. She is going to scream my name. My 
heart and the world both stop in euphoric anticipation. 

&quot;Eila!&quot; 

Darkness. Everything is darkness and I am strangely numb. I blink 
rapidly and try to focus despite feeling very confused. 

My vision clears to a dark room with Sanya leaning over me looking very 
concerned. Apparently I am lying on the floor, something that is 
suddenly made abundantly clear as feeling returns to me as a sharp pain 
in the back of my skull and a dull ache in my back and left hip. 

Sanya repeats my name, looking even more worried as she caresses my 
face. Wait, caresses my face? Dazedly I grin at her, thinking to myself 
that this falling off of chairs stuff is the life, if it comes with 
Sanya&#146;s caresses in the bargain. 

She is really worried by what happened, upset too, and it takes quite a 
bit of me to convince her that I don&#146;t need to be rushed over to the 
medical wing. Even when she calms down I can tell that she doesn&#146;t 
entirely buy that I am fine, apparently I was convulsing on the floor 
and it scared her quite a bit. 

I am still dazed enough by it all that Sanya flips the roles of our 
relationship and tug me over to the bed, making quick work of undressing 
me before surprisingly sternly ordering me to get under the covers. I 
barely have time to realise what happened before she has shed her own 
uniform and cuddles up to me. She twists us around until I am lying with 
my head on her shoulder, our arms loosely wrapped around one another 
save for the hand she has gently playing with my hair. 

What just happened and the ramifications of it finally begin to sink in 
for me, and I am sure that if Sanya was not holding me so sweetly I 
would have remained awake tonight, tormented by the images. Clearly I am 
going insane from loving her, but who can blame me? She is so wonderful. 

Sleepily she informs me that we are going to get up a bit ahead of 
schedule so that we can go find Major Sakamoto or Commander Wilcke to 
report what happened to me. Her embrace is so warm and protective that I 
just fall head over heels in love with her again 

On the table the tarot cards lie scattered, forgotten. </pre>
