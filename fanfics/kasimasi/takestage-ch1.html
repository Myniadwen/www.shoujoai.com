<h1>Take the Stage</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kasimasi/index.html">Kasimasi</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Ayuki Mori walked with the others to their school, her red girl&#39;s 
uniform flowing around her legs as she watched the others with carefully 
hidden amusement. The dark purple haired woman had been doing this for 
weeks now, seeing them pulling together so awkwardly, drifting apart a 
bit, and slowly finding a balance between them.

&#39;It&#39;s incredible,&#39; Ayuki thought, silently reflecting on all that had 
happened to them barely a few months ago.

After being shot down confessing his love Hazumu Osaragi had went up 
into the hills near town to be alone even as may of his friends 
frantically looked for him. All of them had encouraged that love 
confession, and now they felt horribly guilty. Strangely a alien 
spaceship had crashed down on top of him that night and in saving his 
life the aliens had made a mistake... in restoring him they changed him 
into a girl.

Hazumu strode along beside them happily, the red-orange haired girl 
walking comfortably dressed in her matching girl&#39;s uniform. Except for 
some shock when it first happened Hazumu had adapted remarkably well to 
the gender change, taking it better than most of them had. Ayuki 
wouldn&#39;t mention it to anyone but she even wondered if Hazumu had really 
been meant to be a girl from the very start, considering the former 
boy&#39;s delicate nature and sweet personality.

Walking beside Hazumu as usual Tomari Kurusu kept a fond eye on her 
friend, her long brown hair falling in twin ponytails. Tomari had been 
more than a bit shocked by the change in her childhood friend, though 
she had soon discovered that Hazumu&#39;s personality remained the same. Her 
own feelings were confused, however, her long concealed love remaining 
strong even though Hazumu had become a girl like she was.

Ayuki felt a faint stab of guilt, though her expression still remained 
mostly composed. When Hazumu&#39;s former girlfriend began to pursue the now 
female Hazumu she had encouraged Tomari to fight for her too, to step up 
onto the stage and make herself seen in Hazumu&#39;s eyes. In the end Tomari 
had lost in that contest of love, however, and Ayuki knew that she was 
partially responsible for pushing her to that defeat.

As they neared the school a black haired girl looked up from where she 
was waiting by the gate, her pretty face lighting up in a warm smile of 
welcome. &quot;Hazumu,&quot; Yasuna Kamizumi called out to her happily as the two 
women rushed together. Taking together softly they took each other&#39;s 
hands and walked on towards the school building, the rest of them 
falling into step behind them.

&quot;You&#39;ve been awfully quiet today,&quot; Tomari said to Ayuki quietly as they 
walked to class together, watching the young lovers talking happily.

&quot;Just thinking,&quot; Ayuki admitted. She nodded towards where Hazumu and 
Yasuna were walking so close, &quot;Are you all right with all this?&quot;

&quot;I think so,&quot; Tomari shrugged slightly as she continued, &quot;it helps me to 
know that Hazumu is so happy...&quot;

Ayuki reached out to squeeze her shoulder gently in comfort as she said 
to Tomari, &quot;Sometimes I think you put her happiness to far ahead of your 
own.&quot;

Tomari gave her a thoughtful look then she shrugged slightly. &quot;Isn&#39;t 
that what love is about?&quot; she said simply.

Ayuki looked over at her in surprise, feeling oddly humbled by her 
friend. &quot;Maybe so,&quot; she thoughtfully acknowledged.

Later that she found herself up on one of the roofs, looking down as 
people went about their various school activities. She always prided 
herself on her detachment, on not stepping on the stage and taking 
risks, yet... Ayuki sighed. More and more her studied detachment was 
failing her, and she knew exactly why.

&quot;Is everything all right?&quot; Hazumu asked softly, the sweet redhead giving 
her a concerned look.

Ayuki nearly jumped in surprise, looking up to meet her eyes. &quot;Where did 
you come from?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I was out gardening,&quot; Hazumu nodded towards the nearby beds of plants 
that the gardening club and she had helped set up. She gave Ayuki a 
surprisingly piercing look with those innocent eyes and asked her again, 
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Ayuki admitted finally, pushing up her glasses. She 
looked down at the track club practicing, watching the women running in 
circles on the race track. Her eyes tended to where Tomari ran, her long 
brown hair flowing behind her. &quot;Do you ever regret telling Yasuna you 
loved her the first time?&quot; she asked.

&quot;No,&quot; Hazumu shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Even after she rejected you then?&quot; Ayuki asked softly.

&quot;Even if nothing else had happened between us,&quot; Hazumu answered her 
quietly, &quot;letting Yasuna know my feelings, if they were honest, was the 
right thing to do.&quot; Innocently she asked, &quot;Why did you want to know?&quot;

Ayuki decided to be honest, &quot;Because for the first time I&#39;m seriously 
thinking about telling someone I love them.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not me, is it?&quot; Hazumu asked a bit warily.

Fighting back a chuckle Ayuki reassured her, &quot;No, you&#39;re safe.&quot; She 
could certainly understand her concern, though, considering how many of 
her classmates had developed a interest in Hazumu since her change.

&quot;Good,&quot; Hazumu gave a relieved sigh. She looked curious, &quot;This person... 
do you think they share your feelings?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Ayuki said, &quot;we&#39;ve been friends a long time.&quot; A slight 
smile, &quot;And she&#39;s been pretty busy lately.&quot;

&quot;We all have,&quot; Hazumu agreed innocently.

They talked for awhile, Ayuki skillfully deflecting any more personal 
questions then they went back to class. Only half her attention was 
devoted to her teachers, the rest turning over her feelings in her mind, 
examining them. Ayuki felt a mix of relief and dread when the final bell 
came, walking out with the rest. Putting her slippers away she pulled 
her shoes on and walked out the building, waiting by the main gate.

&#39;She doesn&#39;t have club activities today,&#39; Ayuki looked at her watch a 
moment, then up at the students streaming by, &#39;so it shouldn&#39;t be 
long....&#39;

Breaking through the mob of students Tomari reached Ayumi&#39;s side, 
smiling happily in welcome. &quot;I&#39;m glad you waited,&quot; she admitted as they 
fell into step, &quot;Hazumu and Yasuna want everyone to join them on a 
picnic next week.&quot;

&quot;Hazumu is pretty clueless,&quot; Ayuki smiled wryly as they walked, 
&quot;inviting us all along on her dates with Yasuna.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s cute that way,&quot; Tomari chuckled, &quot;but this time I think it&#39;s 
Yasuna&#39;s idea.&quot; Her expression was faintly pained, &quot;It&#39;s their six month 
anniversary party, I think.&quot;

Ayuki reached out to gently squeeze Tomari&#39;s shoulder comfortingly. 
&quot;I&#39;ll be there for moral support,&quot; she said firmly.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Tomari put her hand on Ayuki&#39;s as they stopped on the street, 
the sunlight streaming down around them. Softly she added, &quot;And thank 
you for all your help during all this... you&#39;ve been a good friend.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know how much of a help I&#39;ve been,&quot; Ayuki admitted, &quot;but you&#39;re 
welcome.&quot; She hesitated, searching for the right thing to say....

Tomari saw the hesitation in her eyes and asked, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&#39;I love you,&#39; Ayuki opened her mouth to say, but the words wouldn&#39;t seem 
to come out. Shaking herself she smiled sheepishly as she said, &quot;Never 
mind. Do you have anything you need to do tonight?&quot;

&quot;No, how about you?&quot; Tomari asked, her eyes questioning.

&quot;Let&#39;s do some kareoke and embarrass ourselves,&quot; Ayuki offered with a 
grin, &quot;and I promise not to mention Hazunu and Yasuna.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re on,&quot; Tomari took Ayuki&#39;s hand and they hurried off together.

Ayuki smiled, hurrying along behind her. &#39;I guess I don&#39;t get to step on 
the stage of love today,&#39; she thought, &#39;but there&#39;s always tomorrow.&#39;

End

Notes: While Girl meets Girl is light fare it&#39;s a pretty good anime, and 
I&#39;m quite enjoying reading scanlations of the manga. I liked the 
character of Ayuki a lot and wanted to give her a moment in the sun, 
though I&#39;m not sure how believable her having an unrequited love for 
Tomari is.</pre>
