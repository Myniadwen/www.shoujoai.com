------------------------------------------------

	Kodachi prided herself on her intelligence.  As demented as many 
who had encountered her before thought it to be, none could deny the 
powerful mind behind it.  However, at the moment, she felt as dumb as 
the lowly peons that she considered beneath her.  &quot;That woman was 
Mousse?  He has a curse that turns her into a woman with cold water?&quot;

	Ranma nodded glumly.  She had asked the others to leave after they 
had patched her up so that she could talk privately with Mousse.  She 
could tell from the glint in Kodachi&#39;s eye that she understood.  The 
glint in her eye though was not of mischievousness this time as it had 
often been before but one of growing anger.

	&quot;If I did not see every one of you accept that the girl&#39;s name was 
indeed Mousse, I would have assumed the girl was a relative.  I mean the 
same hair, facial features, clothes, name, the familiarity with all of 
you; it all reeks of her being his sister or some other close relative.  
A person like your friend, Ran.  Always appearing only when you&#39;re in 
the area but never at the same time.  Very believable story of an 
overprotective friend.&quot;

	&quot;Kodachi... I didn&#39;t have to tell you all that about Mousse&#39;s 
curse,&quot; Ranma tried to say but Kodachi didn&#39;t stop.

	&quot;And passed Mousse as a person similar to Ran?  An overprotective 
friend of his that was obsessed enough to take on his name?  Sad to say, 
I would have been blind enough to believe that.&quot;

	&quot;I didn&#39;t do that though.&quot;

	Kodachi continued on as if not hearing Ranma interrupt.  &quot;Then I 
got to thinking about the hot and cold water aspect.  My dear friend 
Ranma is afraid of hot water.  In the few times I have seen Ran, he was 
always wet as if he had just been splashed.  I thought to myself that it 
couldn&#39;t be.  I mean, surely not.  Ranma is my friend.  She would not 
hide something from me.  Something that apparently almost everyone in 
this house knows, but me.&quot;

	Ranma flinched at the accusatory tone.  &quot;I... don&#39;t know what to 
say other than that I am sorry.&quot;

	&quot;Ranma,&quot; Kodachi said, once again interrupting, &quot;I just want to 
know why.&quot;  She had been tempted to storm out of the house when she 
found out.  The only person she had ever truly considered to be her 
friend had lied to her, had not considered her worthy enough to hold a 
secret, and... she was still madly in love with Ranma.  She found 
herself clinging to whatever little scraps Ranma threw her way.  It was 
true, Mousse&#39;s curse did not have to be told and the lie could have been 
continued.

	*Fool, look what she is doing to you.  She?  Hah!  He&#39;s lied since 
the beginning.  Your whole relationship with him was a scam.  He could 
be some sick pervert.  This whole wedding thing would make sense.  The 
whole reason why anyone would try to get close to me would make sense...  
but I have to be sure.*

	Ranma was surprised when Kodachi remained seated and calm.  Ranma 
tried looking into her friend&#39;s face for any clue as to what thoughts 
were going on as she had always done when she dealt with this complex 
girl.  Kodachi had on her old mask of impassiveness and it was 
impossible to crack it this time.

	*I&#39;m losing her,* Ranma thought sadly.  She had thought she had 
made some serious breakthroughs with the girl.  From when she first 
cracked through Kodachi&#39;s imperious front to later when that persona 
changed into that of a prim and proper girl that seemed to be the 
perfect friend.  Ranma could still remember when she told Kodachi of her 
wedding to Shampoo and Akane and how the gymnast had changed yet again.  
The persona settled into what Ranma had believed to have been the real 
self.  The haughtiness of Kodachi&#39;s class combined with the 
thoughtfulness she gained from trying to be a friend.

	&quot;Firstly,&quot; Ranma started, not knowing where else to start, &quot;I have 
to say it again.  I&#39;m sorry for lying to you.  Before you ask, yes, I am 
like Mousse.  I was a boy that changed form into that of a girl.  You 
may not believe this or may think of me as a freak, but since I&#39;ve been 
about six years old, I&#39;ve never thought of myself as a boy.  The curse 
was a godsend for me and if it did not come at the time, I would 
probably had tried to have an operation somewhere down the line.&quot;

	Kodachi did not feel any disgust as she thought she would at 
hearing this confession.  Anger and sadness dominated her at she heard 
the bitterness Ranma&#39;s voice expressed at the word &#39;freak&#39;.

	&quot;You remember our conversation a few weeks ago?  How I told you 
that I wanted to be your friend because I was attracted to you at first 
and because I knew you better?  That is still true.  I do not like you 
as how a boy might if that is what you are thinking.  The reason I 
prefer girlhood is because I like myself as one and that is mirrored by 
what I feel about girls.&quot;

	When Kodachi still did not respond, Ranma tentatively extended her 
arm and took hold of the girl&#39;s folded hands.  &quot;I feared losing you 
because of what you might happen if you knew the truth about my other 
self.  That fear grew the more I came to know and love you...&quot;  Ranma 
was interrupted as she felt Kodachi&#39;s hands beneath her start to 
tremble.  Her hand then felt drops of moisture fall upon it and Ranma&#39;s 
heart nearly stopped.  *How much did I hurt her?*

	&quot;No, Ranma,&quot; Kodachi said, when she felt Ranma start to pull her 
hand away.  &quot;I-I forgive you though there really isn&#39;t anything to 
forgive.  If anything I want to thank you.  I&#39;ve never had anyone that 
cared enough for me to go to all this trouble before.  I&#39;m a bit 
overwhelmed.&quot;

	Ranma sighed with relief.  It was not long after that that she 
remembered she was still injured and that she really should get all the 
lacerations on her body fixed up.  That was of course when Kodachi 
hugged her.

			* * * * *

	&quot;Oh dear,&quot; Kasumi said she heard Ranma&#39;s cry of pain from her 
position at the door.  &quot;I better get the first aid kit.&quot;

	&quot;Should have done that first,&quot; Shampoo fumed, angry at the mushy 
words being exchanged from the other side of the door.  &quot;But no, have to 
worry about Laughing Girl.&quot;

	&quot;Now, now, don&#39;t be like that,&quot; Kasumi consoled.  &quot;What if the 
same thing happened to you and you only just figured out Ranma&#39;s curse?&quot;

	Shampoo quieted down as she remembered her first encounter with 
Ranma&#39;s male side.  The feeling of losing female Ranma had been heavy on 
her mind when male Ranma had beaten her.  While it was a different 
situation, the feeling of loss was something Shampoo was familiar with.

	&quot;She does it again,&quot; Nabiki said dryly, shaking her head in wonder 
at Ranma&#39;s ability to create and diffuse these situations.

	&quot;Ranma.&quot;  Akane smiled as the name passed through her lips.  She 
gave Nabiki a cross look.  &quot;We&#39;ve known Kodachi for some time now.  
She&#39;s a friend and she deserves better than how we&#39;ve been keeping her 
in the dark.&quot;

	&quot;And those other two?&quot; Nabiki asked pointing in the direction of 
the dojo.  &quot;The more people know the more this little secret will leak 
out.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m sure Yuka and Azusa are trustworthy,&quot; Akane said, her voice 
wavering, noticeably unsure if that was to be believed.  It was not that 
she didn&#39;t trust them, she had to consider how they would feel about 
Ranma&#39;s secret.  Not all people would see it Kodachi&#39;s way and Ranma 
being labeled as a freak was just one closed mind away from coming true.

	&quot;Exactly,&quot; Nabiki said, seeing the uncertainty in Akane.  &quot;Which 
is why we still can&#39;t let those two know, if even you aren&#39;t sure about 
how they might feel about this little tidbit about Ranma.  Anyway, that 
isn&#39;t our focus right now.  We have to deal with this situation with 
Mousse or Misu or whatever he calls himself these days.&quot;

			* * * * *

	Ranma smiled as she waved Azusa, Yuka, and Kodachi off, but her 
heart wasn&#39;t in it.  Now that the situation with Kodachi was diverted, 
Ranma&#39;s thoughts turned to the other boy turned girl that she knew.  For 
the first time in her life, she would be facing a challenge and would 
not have her father to turn to.  By the time he came back from his trip 
with Mr. Tendo, it would be too late.  She had no idea how she was going 
to train for the battle in which she knew she was clearly the underdog.  
Sighing, she turned away from the doorway and promptly ran smack into 
Kasumi.

	&quot;Ranma!&quot;  Kasumi was at the same time relieved and regretful that 
she had changed out of her battle bikini and into her regular housedress 
as Ranma face planted itself into her chest.

	&quot;That&#39;s it!  You&#39;re the best Kasumi!&quot; Ranma cheered as an idea 
came to her on how to beat Misu.

	Kasumi panicked as Ranma&#39;s face buried itself further into her 
bosom as the smaller girl hugged her.  It lasted for less than a second 
as panic subsided into a different emotion and a slightly lecherous 
smile formed on her lips.  &quot;No, Ranma, you are.&quot;

	Ranma blinked at Kasumi&#39;s strange words before realizing the 
situation at hand.  She felt her breath rush out of her lungs as the 
older girl returned the favor and made their friendly hug into something 
rather more intimate.  She tried opening her mouth to speak but found 
her mouth muffled by Kasumi&#39;s dress.  Ranma found herself wishing that 
the young homemaker would move a bit so that her mouth could have a 
mouthful of something else other than cloth.

	*Stupid!  Here, Kasumi is comforting you in your time of need and 
you&#39;re thinking perverted thoughts about her,* Ranma scolded herself.  A 
slight warm feeling came over her as she thought of how she was gazing 
off sadly in the direction of her friends as they walked off, and Kasumi 
was behind her, lending support the whole time.

	*What am I becoming?* Kasumi thought.  *Ranma needs my help and 
here I am, taking advantage of it.  On the same day as she is getting 
married to my sister through Shampoo even.*  Propriety however had a 
hard case as Ranma&#39;s now open mouth against her cleavage presented a 
better case.  Kasumi briefly thought against pulling back as Ranma 
obviously wanted to say something.  It would be so easy to move to 
girl&#39;s head a little to the left or right as both sides demanded 
attention if how they were aching against the soft fabric of the dress 
was any indication.  Propriety, however, had held influence over Kasumi 
for over a decade and was not about to lose its hold so soon.

	All at once, Ranma found that she could breath again and found 
herself looking into the rounded, hidden curves that had, not 
uncomfortably, nearly suffocated her a moment before and all words left 
her at their magnificence.

	Kasumi flushed as Ranma&#39;s eyes didn&#39;t raise to meet her face.  
&quot;Um, what&#39;s it, Ranma?  You just yelled something out?&quot;

	Ranma&#39;s eyes cleared as if coming out of a trance at Kasumi&#39;s 
prodding.  &quot;Ah, oh, yeah, I figured out how I can fight against Misu.&quot;

	&quot;Oh?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, I just need to know how to train for it now,&quot; Ranma said 
grimly, her thoughts now fully focused on the problem at hand.  &quot;And 
it&#39;s all thanks to you, Kasumi.&quot;

			* * * * *

	Ranma was in a pensive mood as she headed to bed.  It had been a 
long night and none of them had come up with anything useful.  Coming up 
with a solution was easy.  With Kasumi&#39;s hug earlier on, Ranma came up 
with the idea the only way she would be able to win would be if she 
closed to distance between her and Misu.

	A light coming from the dojo stopped Ranma short.  She wondered 
who would still be training at this hour especially since the dojo was 
still in disarray with all their preparation for this wedding.  
&quot;Shampoo?&quot;

	&quot;Ranma.&quot;

	Ranma was shocked to see tears flowing from Shampoo&#39;s eyes as the 
amazon turned to greet her.  &quot;Shampoo, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

	&quot;Waah!  Shampoo looking forward to wedding night!&quot;

	Ranma stepped back as a torrent of tears came down.  &quot;Er, Shampoo.  
I thought we agreed this was going to be in name only.  There wouldn&#39;t 
have been a wedding night.&quot;

	&quot;No, Shampoo agree not to force Ranma after we is married.  
Shampoo confident that Ranma and Akane lower panties if try hard 
enough.&quot;

	&quot;What!?&quot;

	*Stupid Japanese language.  Did I say that wrong?  Ranma is 
backing away from me.*  &quot;Shampoo want mate with wives.  Shoot two eagles 
with one arrow.  Shake and bake chicken.  Make music with creaking 
bed....&quot;

	&quot;Uh, I got it, I got it,&quot; Ranma quickly put her hand up before the 
girl got to more interesting descriptions.  &quot;Well, anyway, you better 
not let Akane or the others hear that.&quot;

	Shampoo nodded before turning her attention back to the mud 
wrestling pit that was still inside the dojo.

	&quot;You going to turn in, Shampoo?&quot; Ranma asked, hesitating.  Despite 
how off the wall the amazon had sounded, there was something in 
Shampoo&#39;s voice that bothered her.

	Shampoo turned once again to Ranma.  There was no torrent of tears 
this time, just a small, sad smile.  &quot;Not yet.&quot;

	&quot;You really wanted to get married today.&quot;

	Shampoo nodded.  She didn&#39;t know when it was that she found out 
about this driving need of hers to hitch herself to Ranma and Akane, but 
it was there and it was the only thing that she thought of these days.  
There was something so fundamentally right about being with Ranma; 
something she had never known before during all her years in the 
village.

	&quot;Want me to stay up with you for a little while?&quot;

	Shampoo didn&#39;t know what that &#39;something&#39; was, but at the moment, 
this was all the definition she needed for it.  &quot;Yes, thank you, Ranma.&quot;

			* * * * *

	&quot;Ranma, well?  You figure anything out, yet?&quot; Nabiki asked as they 
walked from school, back to the dojo.  As with the night before, they 
had spent all their spare time during school trying to figure a way out 
to help Ranma.  Much to the dismay of Ranma&#39;s homeroom teacher, both 
Shampoo and Kodachi appeared in the middle of the day to help.  Not much 
progress had been gained on either school work or the problem with 
Mousse.

	&quot;No,&quot; Ranma answered morosely, &quot;there just aren&#39;t fast enough 
candidates.  The key to beating Misu is to get close to her body to make 
her whip and cable wire ineffective.  And, um, judging by how she was 
dressed, I doubt she was carrying anymore weapons so I won&#39;t have to 
worry about there being any surprises about close combat.&quot;

	Nabiki poked Ranma in the ribs and noticed Shampoo doing the same 
on the other side.  Both of them did not like how Ranma noticeably 
perked up after mentioning Mousse&#39;s state of undress and the words 
&#39;close combat&#39;.

	&quot;We could use Kuno,&quot; Akane said helpfully.  &quot;He&#39;s pretty fast and 
uses a similar technique.&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s similar, but I could beat Kuno&#39;s move easily.  Both the whip 
and sword suffer in speed because of their length.  There is no way I 
should not be able to move fast enough to dodge either weapon even if 
both Kuno and Misu use their weapons so well that they can attack with 
air currents alone.  However, the whip is different from the bokken in 
that it is malleable.  When Kuno strikes using that speed attack he is 
fond of, the actual range is very small; just the tip of the blade.&quot;

	&quot;With the whip, however, even if I dodge it the first time, Misu&#39;s 
skill is so high, she could easily get me on the second pass with a 
flick of her wrist.  If not then, the third or fourth pass.  Unlike the 
bokken, the area of the attack is almost the entire length of the whip 
and I still have to contend with the air pressure which is also larger 
than that created by Kuno&#39;s sword.  The trick is that I need to be 
faster.  I need to be able to get close to her, where the whip won&#39;t be 
all that effective and take her out before she can tangle me up.&quot;

	&quot;You could practice with me, Ranma,&quot; Kodachi spoke up.  &quot;My 
ribbons are similar to this Mousse&#39;s whip.&quot;

	&quot;Thanks, Kodachi, but the ribbon&#39;s aren&#39;t really effective in a 
frontal assault.  You&#39;ve worked wonders with being able to even hit with 
as much force as you do with them, but their main strength is their 
ability to tie up objects.  They might work as a non-violent way to help 
me in speed training they their missing the ability to affect air 
pressure like Misu&#39;s attack.&quot;

	&quot;Sweeto!&quot;

	&quot;Hey, look at what&#39;s going on over there,&quot; Nabiki said, pointing 
in the direction a group of school girls.

	Ranma and the others looked at what the commotion was all about 
and found themselves staring at a shrunken, old man throwing himself 
into the bosoms of the girls around him.

	&quot;Looks like he knows you, Akane,&quot; Nabiki piped up, interest 
building within her.

	&quot;What?  You&#39;ve got to be kidding.&quot;  Akane listened and sure 
enough, she heard her name being called out by the old fart that was 
making a fool of himself.  &quot;It&#39;s got to be a mistake.  Akane is a common 
name....&quot;  She was stopped as the pervert suddenly glomped onto her with 
amazing speed.  &quot;Get it off, get it off!&quot;

	&quot;Ow,&quot; the old pervert let out as he slumped to the ground.

	Akane blinked as she found beside her own fist, three other hands 
hitting the pervert at the same time.  And they didn&#39;t seem to be in any 
hurry moving away from her chest area.  &quot;Hey, give me some space!&quot; Akane 
yelled, flushing hotly at how close their hands had come to touching 
her.

	Ranma yanked her hand back at the same time as Kodachi and 
Shampoo.  &quot;Ah, Akane... you feeling restricted?&quot;

	&quot;What kind of question... ack, where&#39;d my bra go!?&quot; Akane 
screeched as she felt a draft and noticed her top was unbuttoned.

	&quot;Akane?  Did I hear you call this girl, Akane?&quot; the old lech said, 
stirring out of his minor coma a moment ago.  &quot;Oh, it&#39;s been so long!  
It&#39;s me Happosai!  My, you&#39;ve grown into a fine young woman.  This bra 
is a bit small, but it&#39;s of fine quality.  It&#39;s what I&#39;d expect from the 
daughter of one of my students.  Don&#39;t worry about your size, I&#39;m sure a 
little nurturing and care would help!&quot;  Before he could latch onto her 
warm embrace again, another four fists impeded his way.

	&quot;Just like Soun&#39;s daughter alright,&quot; Happosai sighed from where he 
landed on the ground, this time obviously not waking up from his coma.

	&quot;Soun?  That&#39;s your father&#39;s name, Akane,&quot; Ranma pointed out.  
&quot;Maybe he does know about you.&quot;

	&quot;Akane no want bra back?&quot; Shampoo asked as she pointed to the 
piece of fabric in the old lech&#39;s embrace as they hauled him back to the 
dojo.

	&quot;Would you?&quot; Akane asked looking at the pervert with disgust.  
That was her favorite pair too.  The one that Ranma had liked when they 
shopped at the lingerie shop.

	*Yes,* Shampoo drooled as she noticed that Akane was a sloppy 
dresser.  She had forgot to button her top all the way up.  *Mousse will 
pay for making me miss out on that.*

			* * * * *

	&quot;So, let me get this straight.  You&#39;re our fathers&#39; master?  They 
locked you up in a cave while you were drunk and have been gone for ten 
years?  Forgive me if I don&#39;t believe you,&quot; Nabiki said.

	&quot;Proof is easily shown when your fathers get back,&quot; Happosai 
replied confidently.  &quot;So, if Genma is with Soun, his son must be here.  
I suppose, while I&#39;m here, I might as well teach the lad a thing or two.  
Genma and Soun were supposed to be my heirs but I guess they&#39;re both 
getting on in the years.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m Genma&#39;s child.  He doesn&#39;t have a son, only a daughter, me,&quot; 
Ranma said simply.

	&quot;And what a child,&quot; Happosai grinned lecherously before his face 
turned serious.  &quot;I guess he could have been lying to me to keep me away 
from Nodoka while I trained him.  It would make sense, especially seeing 
you now.  It would... if I didn&#39;t know about Jusenkyo.&quot;

	&quot;Y-You know...&quot;

	Happosai nodded.

	&quot;...and yet you&#39;re still looking at my breasts,&quot; Ranma finished 
angrily, punching the pervert on the head again.  Just like a man!

	&quot;It makes no matter to me what you&#39;re born as.  You are quite 
clearly a girl at the moment.  Actually, I&#39;m surprised as I was right in 
that you were born a boy.  I noticed you unconsciously moving like that 
of a boy at times and almost attributed it to maybe that your father 
raised you as one.  But your female mannerisms and reactions are just 
too new for them to be of a sixteen year old girl.&quot;

	&quot;Well, I&#39;m a girl full time now,&quot; Ranma said pointedly, making 
sure everything was clear.

	&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t mind in the least.  But when I train you, you will be 
in boy form.  I could never really hurt a girl as lovely as you.&quot;

	&quot;Hey, wait a minute.  We don&#39;t even know if you&#39;re telling the 
truth yet,&quot; Akane said.  She glared at the old withered man with a 
glare, not forgetting the incident with her bra.

	&quot;And even if you were telling the truth, what makes you think you 
can tell Ranma what to do?  She&#39;s a girl and will definitely not be 
training as a boy,&quot; Kodachi said emphatically.  She glowed when she 
noticed Ranma smiling at her.

	Happosai couldn&#39;t believe his eyes as the amazon and Akane&#39;s 
sister joined in and formed a wall of female flesh in front of Ranma.  
The look in their eyes when Ranma smiled told him that this was not a 
gesture of sisterly love.  Love, it was, just not sisterly, unless it 
was incestuous.

	*Interesting.  Not what I expected from a Jusenkyo cursed person.  
Most hate their curses.  I would have thought that by forcing him to his 
girl form would get a rise and a fight out of him,* Happosai thought to 
himself.  He felt himself age another decade and frowned inwardly.  
*Then it&#39;s true I have no heir.  Looks like I&#39;ll have to whip either 
Genma or Soun back into shape.  I hope they&#39;ve gained a backbone since 
I&#39;ve been gone.*

	&quot;Thank you, girls, but I can handle this,&quot; Ranma said as she made 
her way to Happosai.  She threw punch straight at the old lech, which he 
easily sidestepped and then with the pipe in his hand tapped her 
outstretched hand.  She was immediately thrown to the other side of the 
room, crashing into the wall.  She quickly put a hand up, indicating to 
her friends she was alright.

	&quot;I believe you.  You move in the Anything Goes style and that was 
a technique from our school that my father once told me about.  I am the 
heir to the Saotome School of Anything Goes,&quot; Ranma said, before 
dropping to her knees.  &quot;Will you accept me and train me as your heir?&quot;

	Happosai raised an eyebrow.  &quot;There is one requirement to be my 
student.  Do you like girls?&quot; he asked, but he already knew the answer.  
&quot;My training style does not have use for women, but if you like girls, 
than maybe I _can_ train you.&quot;

	Ranma gulped and wondered if she was taking on more than she could 
handle.

			* * * * *

	&quot;We&#39;re going to do what?&quot; Ranma asked incredulously.

	&quot;We&#39;re going to liberate some pretties.  Are you hard of hearing?&quot;  
Happosai looked at Ranma critically.  The girl was dressed in all black 
that covered her entire body.  The chest bindings and facemask helped in 
hiding her gender, but only if you didn&#39;t get a good look as the girl 
was quite developed for her size.  It would have to do.  &quot;You told me 
you have a match coming up in a few days, right?  If everything you told 
me about this person&#39;s style is true, then you have a ways to go before 
you can stand a chance.&quot;

	&quot;Okay, okay.  What do I have to do?&quot;

&quot;The afterschool sports clubs will be finishing for the day in a few 
moments.  Specifically, the girls&#39; clubs will be finishing shortly.  
Your training exercise will be to steal, ahem, I mean gather as much 
bras and panties as you can and get out alive without retaliation.  
We&#39;ll be going in through the lobby window to lessen their knowledge of 
our incursion.&quot;

	&quot;What&#39;s the purpose of this training?&quot; Ranma asked doubtfully.

	&quot;Trust me, I&#39;m your sensei!&quot;

	Ranma sighed.  She had a bad feeling about this, but she followed 
after the old pervert towards the Furinkan female changing rooms 
anyways.  She had to beat Misu and he was her best chance.  It seemed 
Happosai had set everything up for this excursion by taking great pains 
to make sure one of the windows was slightly open.  She watched as the 
lech slid open the window quietly and then jumped in past the curtains.

	Ranma stood outside not sure if she could do this as she looked at 
the window opening.  All that separated her from this training was a 
cloth curtain.  Once past, there would be no turning back.  She steeled 
herself up and leaped through.

	&quot;Hey, there&#39;s a pervert trying to steal our panties!&quot;

	Ranma&#39;s eyes widened as she passed through the curtains and found 
herself surrounded by unclothed, unbound, jiggling flesh all around her.  
*I thought this window led to the lobby, not right inside the room!  And 
there was something funny about that strangling voice that announced her 
presence.  Happosai!*

	Happosai watched with glee as various girl scrambled to wrap 
themselves up.  The ones that drew most of his attention however, were 
the ones with less propriety and started to attack Ranma as they were 
dressed.  He spent only a moment watching before he decided to work on 
his real purpose for coming here.  Pretties!

			* * * * *

	&quot;Tsk, tsk, Ranma.  You didn&#39;t get a single panty or bra,&quot; Happosai 
said as he smoked his pipe and looked down at the battered and bruised 
girl.

	&quot;That&#39;s because _somebody_ already took them all!  Not to mention 
the same said person warning the girls.  It&#39;s kind of hard to 
concentrate on anything when dozens of girls are surrounding you.&quot; Ranma 
screamed, looking at Happosai accusingly.

	&quot;Oh, yes, that&#39;s right.  Well, you know the path is fraught with 
peril.  There will be those that take everything before you can get a 
chance to get anything yourself.  And there are those that are bastards.  
Let that be a lesson to you.&quot;

	&quot;Why you!&quot;  A couple of times being tossed around like a rag doll 
later, Ranma&#39;s head was much clearer.  It also hurt a lot more though.

	Happosai puffed a smoke ring out as he sat gloatingly on top of 
Ranma&#39;s head.  &quot;You&#39;re a hundred years too young to beat me.  So, what 
did you learn?&quot;

	Ranma took another swipe at the master, but he easily jumped out 
of the way and landed a few paces in front of her.  His face was blank 
and showed none of the previous lecherousness.  He looked serious for a 
change.

	She thought of what happened in the changing room.  When Happosai 
had been discovered, she noticed that even surrounded by girls, he had 
easily dodged every single one of them and still managed to steal their 
underwear.  His speed had been phenomenal.  Had the arms and legs been 
cable wires and whips, the pervert still would not have had much of a 
problem.  But there was something else.  It was his hands.

	&quot;You weren&#39;t only dodging.  It is not impossible to dodge a dozen 
fists coming at you from all directions, if you deflect some of them 
first, right?&quot;

	&quot;Genma trained you well,&quot; Happosai nodded approvingly.  Even 
getting the life beaten out of her, the girl still managed to pick up 
details from the fight.  She might just work out.

	&quot;Your hands were moving so fast I couldn&#39;t even see them,&quot; Ranma 
continued as she concentrated on what exactly Happosai did.  She 
recalled thinking that he had ten arms at one time because it looked 
like they had sprouted from his body, but had attributed it to her 
swimming head at the time.  &quot;No, not that I couldn&#39;t see them.  They 
were moving so fast that they left an afterimage on my brain, making me 
believe they were blurring in my eyesight.&quot;

	The more she thought of the training exercise, the more Ranma&#39;s 
confidence grew.  The old man&#39;s eyes twinkled as she continued.  She was 
right!  &quot;What you couldn&#39;t dodge, you blocked.  If that trick you do 
with your pipe on my wrist is any indication, all you need is a feather 
light touch, that most people wouldn&#39;t notice in a battle, to deflect 
those punches without them knowing.  To the onlooker and to the people 
fighting you, it would look like they were missing you.&quot;

	&quot;Very well done, Ranma,&quot; Happosai smiled finally.  &quot;It&#39;s a revised 
version of a crude technique I learned so many years ago called the 
Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken.  Like that move, it requires a person to have 
a certain amount of speed training before it can even be attempted to 
use.  Hence, my having you in that changing rooms.  Nothing like dodging 
an enraged mob of women to work on speed.  After speed has been 
achieved, the final part of the technique requires one to pick chestnuts 
out of an open fire.  Remarkably effective, but not for me.  I revised 
the training to picking up underwear from women that don&#39;t want you to 
take it.&quot;

	Ranma could see how that would be more effective.  Where the fire 
version is static, standing in one place, Happosai&#39;s version required a 
bit more dexterity, especially with the requirement that there be no 
retaliation.  &quot;Um, Master Happosai, where are you going?&quot;

	&quot;Ranma,&quot; Happosai scolded.  &quot;I told you a cutey like you can call 
me Happy.&quot;

	&quot;Uh, Happy, I thought we were going to train some more.&quot;

	&quot;Well the girls are done for the day, so we&#39;ll have to find 
something else to do.  I&#39;ll take you on my rounds later tonight.  Right 
now I have to bring this treasure back to the dojo.&quot;

	*Rounds?* Ranma wondered.  Somehow she doubted Happosai patrolled 
the streets keeping them safe.

			* * * * *

	Happosai smiled as he sneaked down to the laundry room.  *My dear 
Ranma-chan, the reason I wanted to come home wasn&#39;t only because I 
wanted to bring my treasure home.  Since you were with me on my hunt, 
your change of clothes wasn&#39;t at the school.*

	With barely contained glee, Happosai dove into the laundry basket 
reveling in the sights and scents.  *There&#39;s wonderful Akane&#39;s!  Ooh, 
this one has to be Shampoo&#39;s.  And these two... must belong to Kasumi 
and Nabiki.  I&#39;ll leave those here.*  There was something about the 
older Tendo that made Happosai think twice about either glomping her to 
taking her most intimate apparel.  The girl had been the only one to ask 
him if he was fine from the injuries Ranma&#39;s friends had given him and 
had also offered to cook food for him.  Happosai had always been a 
sucker for the homemaker type of girl.  Nabiki on the other hand... he 
shuddered as he remembered the shark-like look on her when he gazed at 
her slender body.  That girl, he did not want to tangle with.  On the 
other hand, if she asked, he could always deny taking her panties.  Hers 
was quickly added to the stash.

	Happosai was proud of his ability to match underwear with its 
owner, and his special skill was telling him what he wanted wasn&#39;t here.  
*Where&#39;s Ranma&#39;s panties?*

			* * * * *

	&quot;Akane, can I borrow you&#39;re hanky?  I think I&#39;m coming down with 
something,&quot; Yuka asked, sniffling.  While yesterday had been fun, being 
half naked in that cold mud was making her pay.

	&quot;Huh, what?  I don&#39;t have a handkerchief,&quot; Akane quickly said.  
Underneath the table, outside of her friends&#39; notice, her hand was 
frantically trying to stuff a silky piece of fabric down her pocket.  *I 
knew I shouldn&#39;t have worn jeans.*

	&quot;Yes, you do.  I just saw you sneezing into something, a moment 
ago,&quot; Sayuri said.  Actually, she didn&#39;t get that good a look.  Now that 
she thought about it, the sound was more of a &#39;sniffing&#39; noise than a 
sneezing one.

	&quot;Oh, that... that was used.  I don&#39;t want you to get my germs.  I 
might be coming down with something too.  &lt;cough&gt; &lt;cough&gt;  See?&quot;

	&quot;Ah, that&#39;s alright.  I&#39;ll get a tissue from the washroom,&quot; Yuka 
said, giving Akane a strange look.  Akane sure was acting weird.  Well, 
the tests they were studying for were important, so the poor girl was 
probably frazzled.

	&quot;Say, why isn&#39;t Ranma here?&quot; Sayuri asked.

	Akane breathed a sigh of relief as attention was diverted from 
her.  &quot;Ah, she&#39;s training with an old sensei of our fathers.  It&#39;s all 
top secret and she won&#39;t be in school for the next week.&quot;

			* * * * *

	Nabiki shuddered as she pulled the fabric up tight against her.  
She had to lay down with her back on her bed when she almost collapsed 
from the way her knees were wobbling.  When she couldn&#39;t take it 
anymore, she released her tight grip on the edge of the fabric and let 
her hands drop to her sides.  She fought to control her ragged breaths 
before she finally pushed herself up off the bed.  She was amazed at how 
the fabric clung to her even though she stood up.

	Gently she lowered it down, shivering each time the silky material 
touched her leg.  *Ranma&#39;s butt really is smaller than mine,* Nabiki 
thought idly.  She paused as she finally removed now very wet item and 
held it in front of her.  The sounds of footsteps outside her door 
alerted her, and she quickly and efficiently hid it under her blankets.

	&quot;Nabiki, it&#39;s almost dinner.  What are you doing in there?&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m just changing, Kasumi.&quot;

	&quot;But you got home an hour ago.  Well, anyway, hurry and finish 
up.&quot;

	&quot;Okay, give me a few minutes.  I need to put on some panties.&quot;

	Kasumi paused as she walked away from the door.  That was a bit 
more descriptive than normal from her sister.  Nabiki was mostly likely 
trying to get a rise out of her like she sometimes did.  Kasumi had 
thought her sister had put aside such childish antics away years ago.

			* * * * *

	Shampoo waited until Kasumi walked away from the door before 
quietly bringing out her new toy out from under the blankets.  She 
couldn&#39;t help but smile when she saw the monogrammed &#39;RS&#39; done in the 
American style on the edge of it.  It was her Airen&#39;s name.  She moaned 
softly as a distinct musky odor wafted from it.

	And so it goes.

			* * * * *

	&quot;Sister, what are you doing in there?  A Kuno does not wash 
laundry.&quot;

	&quot;I do not trust to servants to handle this matter.  It is much to 
delicate for their hands.&quot;

			* * * * *

	&quot;Azusa name you Ranma,&quot; she smiled as she looked at the cute 
object.  Ranma wasn&#39;t French, but it was sooo cute just like its owner 
that she just has to give it the same name.

			* * * * *

	&quot;Bye Akane, Sayuri,&quot; Yuka said as she waved her friends goodbye.  
*Oops,* she thought as she noticed there was something clinging to her 
hands.  She had spent the whole night with one hand in her pocket 
clinging to it that she didn&#39;t even notice.  She hoped no one noticed 
her taking it out of the Tendo household the other day.

			* * * * *

	Happosai slumped to the ground dejected and stared vacantly at his 
collection.  He looked through the entire house and he couldn&#39;t find a 
single used or just washed pair.  It didn&#39;t matter to him which it was 
as he enjoyed both the just washed scent as he did the odorous one.  He 
didn&#39;t enjoy ones that have been sitting at the bottom of a drawer 
collecting dust.

	&quot;Grandfather Happosai, what are you doing?  Did you hear me call 
dinner?&quot; Kasumi asked when she found the door to his room open.

	&quot;Ah, Kasumi, I&#39;m too depressed to eat... my what&#39;s that delicious 
smell?&quot; Happosai asked as Kasumi neared him.  It was her.  &quot;Kasumi, you 
smell like Ranma.&quot;

	&quot;Ah, Ranma just came home and I made her take a bath.  She was a 
mess.  I just carried her clothes into the laundry room.  They were all 
very dirty.&quot;

	&quot;Hmm?  Suddenly my appetite is back.  Set a seat at the table for 
me, dear.  I&#39;ll be in, in a second,&quot; Happosai grinned.  Dirty clothes, 
she said?  The training session had produced yet another great result.  
Time for a little trip to the laundry room.

	Kasumi smiled when she saw the old man perk up.  She wasn&#39;t sure 
what she said, but he was apparently very happy.  She sniffed down at 
herself and was slightly taken aback that the master could smell Ranma 
on her.  *Well her clothes were very dirty,* she thought, remembering 
the battered redhead walking into the house.  She absently fingered the 
scrunched up ball of fabric in her apron pocket.  *Very dirty.*

			* * * * *

	&quot;Where&#39;s your great-grandmother, Shampoo?  I haven&#39;t seen her in 
over a week.&quot;  Ranma was nervous as she looked around for her future in-
law as they waited for Misu to appear.

	&quot;Great-Grandmother setting up restaurant for Shampoo to live in 
while in Nerima,&quot; Shampoo replied sadly.  &quot;Just tell today and will come 
and watch battle.  Win or lose, decide to stay in Japan for a while so 
that Shampoo learn about outside world.&quot;

	&quot;Ah, that&#39;s too bad,&quot; Ranma said honestly, but was secretly 
relieved as it meant there would be less chance for her to succumb to 
Shampoo&#39;s enticements.

	&quot;Yeah, too bad,&quot; Akane agreed without thinking.  &quot;I, uh, mean, too 
bad, I won&#39;t get more chances to beat up on you during practice.&quot;

	&quot;Shampoo know what Wife mean,&quot; Shampoo said as she slid sensuously 
over to the youngest Tendo.  She had discovered that it was so much 
easier to control Akane this way than force.  If &#39;hard&#39; doesn&#39;t work 
than try &#39;soft&#39; as the saying went.

	Nabiki laughed outright as Akane tried running away from one of 
Shampoo&#39;s famous glomps.  As if the girl had any chance against the 
amazon.  &quot;So where&#39;s Mousse?&quot;

	No sooner than that question was voiced, a croaking voice alerted 
their attention to a man laying face down on the field where their fight 
was to be.  He was crawling slowly towards Ranma, Kodachi noticed.  
&quot;Ranma, it&#39;s Mousse... in male form.&quot;

	&quot;Misu... Mousse?&quot;  Ranma ran over to the man and found the guy to 
be rasping out.  &quot;Quick, get us some water somebody.&quot;

	&quot;No, not water,&quot; Mousse tried to croak out desperately, but to no 
avail.  He counted to three and immediately the person bringing him 
water tripped and fell.  A curse indeed.

	&quot;Ah, thank-you,&quot; Misu said hoarsely, but still managing to make it 
sound sexy with that deep throaty voice.  As per usual, she quickly 
doffed her robe and was again half naked underneath, with suspenders the 
only things hiding any of her upper body.  &quot;I needed that.  Get me some 
more.&quot;

	Misu was immediately swarmed by male onlookers from the crowd, all 
offering water.  &quot;Ah, you boys are so sweet,&quot; Misu said as she stuck out 
her tongue to lick some of the water that drooled on the outer sides of 
her lips.&quot;

	&quot;Misu?  What happened?&quot; Ranma asked, trying hard not to stare as 
the boys were doing.

	&quot;Silly Mousse.  He thought that he could contain me as long as he 
didn&#39;t go anywhere, where there was water.  But, he _is_ me and as such 
couldn&#39;t stop himself from making to this match.  Now, Ranma are you 
prepared?&quot;

	Ranma nodded and made her way to the middle of the field.  For one 
week she had been subjected to daily and nightly beatings from mobs of 
women from bathing houses to school changing rooms.  She idly remembered 
her last training session before this fight.  She had gathered a total 
of a hundred pairs of underwear before she was forced to flee the scene.  
She managed to get hit only twice.  She was damn ready.

			* * * * *

	&quot;Maybe I was wrong about the girl after all,&quot; Cologne said as she 
suddenly appeared beside Shampoo.  The both of them were transfixed by 
the fight.  A fight which Ranma should have lost but was clearly the 
superior.  &quot;That technique she is using...&quot;

	&quot;Yes, Great-Grandmother, it resemble Amazon technique, no?&quot; 
Shampoo asked in wonder.  Ranma had kept secret her training with the 
old pervert.  Never would she had believed that Wife was training 
Joketsuzoku moves.

	&quot;Ew, Shampoo, who do you have beside you?&quot; Happosai asked as he 
bounded towards the amazon ready to give his daily affirmation of love.  
Besides, both Akane and Kodachi had denied it to him.  Can&#39;t anyone feel 
sorry for an old man who just wants to feel some nubile young flesh 
before he goes?

	&quot;Happy!?&quot; Cologne was surprised someone she thought she would 
never see again appeared in front of her.

	&quot;Who... Cologne-chan?  What happened to you?&quot; Happosai asked, 
recalling the statuesque girl of his past.

	&quot;It&#39;s been many years.  I should have guessed.  This is your 
doing?&quot;

	&quot;Well, she is the heir to the Anything Goes style.&quot;

	&quot;She&#39;s also built.&quot;

	&quot;She&#39;s also built,&quot; Happasai agreed, knowing that he couldn&#39;t hide 
anything much from this woman.

	&quot;Well, she&#39;s almost officially an amazon.  I suggest you go find 
someone...&quot;

	&quot;Great-grandmother mean it?  Ranma, amazon?&quot; Shampoo asked, nearly 
jumping for joy.

	&quot;Yes,&quot; Cologne said, emphasizing it for Happosai&#39;s benefit.  If 
_he_ wanted her for an heir, then so would she.  Happy, despite his 
appetite for women, also had a keen eye for able martial artists.  It 
was just that able martial artists also had a keen sense not to follow 
the pervert around.

			* * * * *

	Misu blinked as the fist stopped mere millimeters from her face.  
She looked into Ranma&#39;s serious face.  The other girl didn&#39;t want to go 
too far, Misu could see it in her eyes.  &quot;I yield.&quot;

	&quot;Thank you.&quot;

	&quot;No, thank you,&quot; Misu replied.  &quot;Though, I think you don&#39;t know 
what you&#39;re missing.  You and Shampoo would have been very happy under 
me.&quot;

	&quot;Me?  I thought you were fighting for...,&quot; Ranma gulped at as the 
woman licked her lips.  The effect was made stronger by the clothing she 
had chosen to wear for this fight.  A full dominatrix outfit.  The 
various times she had caught glimpses of skin during the battle had 
nearly cost her the fight.  *She was fighting for me also,* Ranma 
thought with certainty.

	&quot;Oh, well, if I can&#39;t have Shampoo... there is still you.  See, 
you later, girlfriend.&quot;

	&quot;Girlfriend?  What did she mean by that?&quot; Nabiki asked 
suspiciously as she caught the tail end of the conversation.

	&quot;Nothing, hehehe,&quot; Ranma answered nervously, her hand 
characteristically rubbing the back of her head sheepishly.

			* * * * *

	&quot;Kasumi, we&#39;re home!  Where is everyone?&quot; Soun asked as he looked 
around the house, finding only his oldest daughter.

	&quot;Oh, they&#39;re all at Ranma&#39;s fight.&quot;

	&quot;Fight?  Good!  The boy is getting manlier every minute,&quot; Genma 
cried into his hands.  He knew it would be good to have the boy engaged 
to a girl.

	&quot;Anything else happen while we were gone, Kasumi?&quot; Soun asked, 
while giving his old friend a pat on the shoulders.  He was right.  The 
boy would come around.

	&quot;Nothing much,&quot; Kasumi answer and went back to sweeping.  &quot;Oh, 
silly me.  Your master visited and is living with us now.  Father?  
Uncle Genma?&quot;  *They must be tired from the trip.  They both went out 
like a light.*
