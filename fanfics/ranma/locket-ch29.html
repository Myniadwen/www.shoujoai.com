A grinning Priss Asagiri was up on stage, belting out the tune in the 
original Japanese with Minako Aino and Rei Hino providing a 
professional backup. Juri took a moment to translate the words 
mentally and smirked.

&quot;Hey, how are you Romeo-sama? People say that you&#39;re old fashioned,&quot;

Urd laughed, dancing in front of the stage in a skintight bodysuit 
that left very little to the imagination. She and the younger Priss 
made one hell of a pair, two wild childs out to have fun and kick some 
butt.

Linna, still looking like some kind of office lady despite her party 
clothes, was getting mildly buzzed sitting on a couch with her love, 
Belldandy. Juri couldn&#39;t believe that Belldandy and Urd were sisters, 
their personalities were just so totally different.

Skuld was sitting with Washu and Yume, and Juri didn&#39;t want to think 
about what the precocious young lady was picking up from the two of 
them. Still, she was cute, and both ladies had given Juri her word 
that they&#39;d stay out of trouble.

Juri looked around, frowning. She walked over to Linna and quietly 
asked, &quot;Where are Mara and Sylia?&quot;

&quot;They rented a room upstairs,&quot; Belldandy smiled, even as Linna blushed 
faintly.

&quot;Should have known,&quot; Juri muttered, receiving a quiet laugh.

Priss grinned at Urd, belting out the next bit, &quot;Logic can&#39;t make us 
understand, you know, the things that our hearts want to have,&quot;

Juri left them to their party, idly wondering what they were all here 
celebrating. Excel scampered by her, carrying a tray covered with 
bottles of booze for the party, and oddly, a can of coke for 
Belldandy.

Natsuna, Haruna, Makoto, and Ami were sitting at a nearby table, 
enjoying the music and the good company. &quot;I understand that the papers 
are saying Sailor Venus works for you,&quot; Ami said to Natsuna with a 
smile.

Natsuna rolled her eyes, &quot;Just because she&#39;s saved me a few times.&quot;

Makoto looked over at Haruna, gently putting her hand over hers. &quot;I&#39;m 
glad you realized I&#39;m Sailor Jupiter,&quot; she said quietly.

Haruna laughed, &quot;I started getting a clue when Sailor Jupiter saved me 
from a purse snatching, right after my girlfriend left.&quot; Makoto 
blushed faintly. Haruna took pity on her, rising and pulling her to 
her feet, &quot;Let&#39;s dance.&quot;

May smiled, thinking they were such a cute couple. A young lady was 
sitting at one of the dining tables alone, so she hurried over. With a 
cheerfull smile, &quot;Can I help you?&quot;

The brown haired girl looked a bit startled. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she blushed and 
asked, &quot;Is there anything you&#39;d recommend?&quot;

&quot;Everything Sasami makes is good,&quot; May smiled, and mentioned the day&#39;s 
special.

&quot;That sounds pretty good,&quot; she nodded, &quot;but could you wait a moment?&quot; 
May turned to where the woman was looking, and say an elegant, dark 
haired younger woman emerge from the bustling crowds.

&quot;Am I late, Misaki?&quot; the dark haired girl smiled.

&quot;I got here early, Hatoko,&quot; Misaki smiled, wrapping her arms around 
the younger woman.

A smiling May slipped away, giving them a bit of privacy, as well as 
going to put in the order for two dinners.

Ryouko gave her a nod even as she put a show on for the customers at 
the bar, tossing the bottles of booze around with Minagi. &quot;What can I 
get you?&quot; she grinned.

The redhead looked devastating, her body hugging dress leaving little 
to the imagination. &quot;A glass of red wine, please,&quot; she smiled. She 
looked around, a little frown on her face as she asked her hesitantly, 
&quot;Is Tendo Nabiki here?&quot;

Minagi raised her eyebrow at her twin, jumping in with, &quot;Sorry, it&#39;s 
her night off.&quot; She looked at the redhead bombshell and asked, &quot;Would 
you like me to pass on a message?&quot;

The redhead looked a bit down, &quot;Just tell her that Ayeka Kisaragi was 
here to see her.&quot; Ayeka turned, and disappeared into the teeming young 
women.

Minagi and Ryouko exchanged a glance. &quot;Nabiki&#39;s been holding out on 
us,&quot; Ryouko observed, &quot;she didn&#39;t say anything about her.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t wait to tell Sasami,&quot; Minagi chuckled.

&quot;Tell me what?&quot; Sasami asked, stepping out of the pantry for a moment.

&quot;Nabiki&#39;s seeing a babe,&quot; Ryouko grinned.

A short young woman with sandy blonde hair bodily dragged a green 
faced Hyatt up to the bar. &quot;She just collapsed,&quot; Nene gasped. Hyatt 
gave them all a weak smile and a wave.

&quot;She does that all the time,&quot; Keiko said casually. The boy&#39;s uniform 
she wore caught Nene&#39;s eye, and the girl gulped visibly.

&quot;She&#39;s taken,&quot; Sasami said gently, and Nene blushed.

&quot;I&#39;m not, I mean, I...&quot; Nene shook her head, her cheeks red. &quot;This 
place is nuts,&quot; they heard her murmur as she walked away, then she 
added, &quot;must be why Priss likes it so much.&quot;

Excel bounded over, &quot;Hyatt!&quot; She picked her right up off of the floor 
and they both snuggled together cutely.

&quot;On the kawaii meter, that&#39;s about a nine,&quot; Setsuna noted with a 
smile. She looked around curiously, &quot;Where&#39;s Juri?&quot;

&quot;Upstairs office,&quot; Keiko shrugged. With Nabiki away, it meant that 
Juri had to do the paperwork. A visit from Setsuna would probably be 
greeted like salvation.

Setsuna ascended the stairs, hiding a smile as she noticed several 
ladies trying to look up her skirt. She reached Juri&#39;s office and 
knocked gently, &quot;Juri?&quot;

&quot;Come in,&quot; she heard, and Setsuna pushed the door open. Juri had the 
books open, looking at columns of numbers with a peeved expression. 
&quot;Nabiki&#39;s day off,&quot; Juri explained with a smile.

&quot;Would you like a break?&quot; Setsuna chuckled.

&quot;Take me away from all this,&quot; Juri said dramatically and they both 
laughed.
