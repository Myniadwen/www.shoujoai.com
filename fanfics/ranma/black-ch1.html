<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/evileric.html">Evil Eric</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;My love, my enemy, my friend,
You&#39;ve left me black and blue again,
Romantic conflict just has left me paralyzed,
The way I feel about you, I had never realized.&quot;
-EASTside Four, &quot;Black and Blue&quot;

Ranma had hoped, just for once, he could make it to school without
something going horribly, horribly wrong.  Something had.

&quot;Well if she did, I bet you&#39;d just *love* it!&quot; Akane hollered.

&quot;Hey!  Did you hear one word I said other than &#39;Shampoo&#39; or what?&quot; he
shot back.  He wasn&#39;t in the mood to deal with this today.

His morning hadn&#39;t exactly been stellar.  He&#39;d already been tossed into
the koi pond twice, orbit-kicked once, Genma had eaten his breakfast,
and Happosai had made another of his random visits just as a dripping
Ranma-chan had pulled herself out of the koi pond in nothing but a tank
top and boxers.  That hadn&#39;t been the highlight of the day, to say the
least.

He and Akane had been dashing madly to school again when he had made an
off-topic remark that wouldn&#39;t it be just *great* if Shampoo showed up
and tried to kidnap or blackmail him into dating her again?  The tomboy,
being unable to detect sarcasm of any kind, had launched into one of her
rants about what a sick pervert he was.  So here they were.

&quot;If you want to be with Shampoo so much, go to her!&quot; Akane screeched.
&quot;I sure won&#39;t miss you!&quot;

&quot;Dammit, I didn&#39;t do anything!  Quit yelling at me!&quot;

Akane was about to ignore this last suggestion and continue yelling at
him when his martial artist&#39;s awareness kicked in.  Seemingly out of
nowhere, he grabbed the blue-haired girl off her feet and pressed her
body to his.  Half a second later, there was a huge hole in the ground
where Akane had been standing, and an amorous, mallet-wielding Kuno
Kodachi standing over it.

Akane, of course, thought the best thing to do in this situation was to
give Ranma a black eye.

&quot;You hentai!  Let go of me!&quot;

&quot;Well excuse *me* for saving your *life*!&quot; Ranma shot back, not putting
up with her ingratitude.

Kodachi cleared her throat loudly, and the two of them turned their
attention to the leotard-wearing gymnast.  Ranma let go of Akane, and
the instant he did, Kodachi attached herself to his neck.

&quot;Such an ungrateful peasant, isn&#39;t she, Ranma darling?&quot; Kodachi cooed.
&quot;Certainly there are more...appealing choices of company?&quot;

Ranma tried to babble out a response as Akane began fuming all over
again.  &quot;What the hell are you doing?!&quot; she asked both of them.

Kodachi got an evil look in her eyes and pulled herself from Ranma&#39;s
almost-embrace.  She bowed politely to Akane.

&quot;I am merely engaging in friendly and fair competition for our mutual
object of affection, Tendo-san,&quot; she said.

While she had her head lowered, Kodachi swung the mallet again, trying
to catch Akane off-guard.  Instead, Akane caught the mallet and sent it
sideways into the ground again.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what part of that to correct first, but it sounds like an
attempt to add insult to injury,&quot; Akane said.

&quot;Ohoho,&quot; Kodachi laughed.  &quot;It seems I have outlived my welcome, so I
shall take my leave of you, Ranma darling.  But fear not, I shall return
soon!  The Black Rose shall not be denied!  Ohohohohoho!&quot;

With that, she took to the rooftops in a spray of black rose pedals.
One completely intact rose, thorns and all, found its way to Akane&#39;s
face.  Akane seethed with rage again, and started running after the
gymnast.

&quot;You get back here!  I&#39;m not finished with you!&quot;

Ranma stood there, dumbstruck, watching Akane trail Kodachi with her own
mallet.  He shook his head, realizing how foolish he had been to think
he could get to school without hell breaking loose.

&quot;And they blame *me* for things not being normal around here,&quot; he said.

-----

Later that night, Akane was just returning to her room after a long,
late-night training session.  Her muscles ached and her gi was soaked
with sweat.  Naturally, she was looking forward to a long bath.

She set her workout towel down on her bed, and she noticed something
else she had left there before her workout: the black rose Kodachi had
thrown at her that morning.  She had hidden it in her uniform all day at
school because she hadn&#39;t wanted Ranma or her friends to see it.  Even
now, she opened her door a crack to make sure no one was coming her way.
A crash downstairs followed by what sounded like Nabiki making Ranma pay
for something else told her she was safe.

Akane closed the door again.  She held the dark flower to her nose and
slowly inhaled its scent.

&quot;Ho ho ho,&quot; said a voice.  &quot;Like it?&quot;

Akane jerked her head around, trying to see who had spoken, but there
was no one else in the room.  At least, not on the ground.  She looked
up, and there was Kodachi, bracing herself on the ceiling with both feet
and one hand, holding her mallet in the other.

&quot;What are you doing up there?&quot; Akane asked.

&quot;Merely attempting to gain the advantage,&quot; Kodachi said.  She hopped
down from the ceiling and spun the mallet around in her hand.

Akane crossed her arms and gave the black-haired girl a smug look.  &quot;Uh-
huh, right, like I&#39;d ever let you get that.&quot;

&quot;Ah, but I already have!  I am here, am I not?&quot;

&quot;Maybe, but the question is how long you get to stay here.&quot;

&quot;Oho, how much time will this earn me?&quot;

Kodachi set the mallet on the edge of Akane&#39;s desk.  She brought her
hands to Akane&#39;s soft cheeks and gently drew the other girl closer, and
closer, until their lips met.

Akane broke the kiss after a second.  &quot;Good, but let me take care of
something first.&quot;

She reached around to the back of Kodachi&#39;s head and undid the white
ribbon that held her ponytail.  The gymnast&#39;s long, silky hair fell all
around her shoulders, and Akane nodded her approval.

&quot;There, much better,&quot; she said.

They kissed again, but this time it was more than a brief contact like
the last time.  Akane&#39;s tongue slid between her lips and traced the
outline of Kodachi&#39;s, pleading entrance to the gymnast&#39;s mouth.  Kodachi
puckered her lips around Akane&#39;s tongue, then opened her mouth and let
it duel with her own.

The two girls stayed like that a long time, each enjoying the taste of
the other&#39;s mouth while their hands caressed each other&#39;s bodies.  Akane
stroked the Black Rose&#39;s raven-colored hair, while Kodachi ran her palms
along Akane&#39;s back.

After a while they separated, looking into each other&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Wow...&quot; Akane said.  &quot;I&#39;d say you&#39;ve earned as much time as you want.&quot;
She giggled.

&quot;Ah, my love, you are too gracious,&quot; Kodachi said.

She moved around behind the shorter girl and put her hands on Akane&#39;s
shoulders.  She rubbed them gently but firmly, relieving the tension in
Akane&#39;s muscles.  Akane&#39;s breathing became ragged.

&quot;Ahh, you always know-oh!-exactly what to do...&quot; Akane said.

&quot;Well, it is not as if the rigors of training have left me without a
proper sense of the body,&quot; Kodachi explained.

&quot;I&#39;ll say you have a proper sense of the body!&quot;

&quot;So glad you agree...&quot;

Kodachi continued massaging Akane&#39;s back with her left hand while her
right sneaked around to Akane&#39;s chest.  She ran a finger slowly up and
down her breast, tracing the kanji in Akane&#39;s name through the fabric of
the gi.  Akane moaned with pleasure, but Kodachi wasn&#39;t finished.  The
gymnast fastened her lips around Akane&#39;s earlobe and blew softly into
her ear.

Akane gasped and screwed her eyes shut.  She was thankful Kodachi was
standing behind her as she continued her ministrations, or she probably
would have fallen over right there.

&quot;Koda-chan...&quot;

&quot;Yes, Akane love?&quot;

&quot;You know, someday we&#39;re-ooh!-going to have to tell people about us...&quot;

&quot;I know, love.&quot;

Kodachi rubbed her fingernail over Akane&#39;s nipple, grinding it softly
through the gi.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid of how Ranma will take it,&quot; Akane said.  &quot;I think he still
loves me...part of him does, anyway.&quot;

&quot;I know, Akane-chan, I am afraid of that too,&quot; Kodachi said.  &quot;And I am
worried how my dear brother will react.  Although he doesn&#39;t pose the
same hazard Ranma does, he does have quite a capacity to make all our
lives a living hell.&quot;

&quot;Not to mention our families,&quot; Akane added.  She really didn&#39;t want to
imagine her father&#39;s reaction if he ever found out what she and the
Black Rose were doing.  Or, for that matter, what would happen if
Principal Kuno did.  Then there was Ryoga, and Kuno, and Gosunkugi...and
even her friends Yuka and Sayuri.

Kodachi could sense her lover&#39;s passion giving way to apprehension, and
decided to do something about it.  She turned Akane around in her arms
and held her.

Looking Akane in the eyes, she said, &quot;Stop that.  This is a time for us.
There will be a time for them.  Right now I need you.  I love you.
Always remember that, Akane love.  I love you, no matter what any of
them have to say about it.&quot;

&quot;Gomen,&quot; Akane said.  &quot;I know...I love you too, Koda-chan.  I always
will.&quot;

&quot;And do you want me?&quot; Kodachi asked.

&quot;Gods, yes!&quot; Akane said.  &quot;I want you right here, right now!&quot;

Kodachi&#39;s trademark devilish look appeared on her face again, but this
time there was an aura of lust surrounding it.  She noticed Akane was
still holding the rose she had &quot;taunted her&quot; with earlier, and took it
in her own hands.

&quot;Patience, my love, patience...a proper expression of love must be
absolutely perfect from start to finish, each second bringing pleasure
greater than the one before it...&quot;

Kodachi traced the rose&#39;s soft petals over Akane&#39;s face.  Akane closed
her eyes and whined.

&quot;Mouu...you aristocrats and your &#39;proper conduct!&#39;  It&#39;s enough to drive
a person mad!&quot;

&quot;Yes, but can you deny that our love-making is any less than a work of
art, Akane-chan?&quot;

&quot;Nooo...&quot;

&quot;Then let us paint the walls with our love!&quot;

With that, Kodachi pushed Akane gently backward onto the bed.  Tossing
the sweaty towel aside, Kodachi pressed her body against her lover&#39;s,
and Akane found herself the patron of Kodachi&#39;s art.

-----

&quot;You want me to do WHAT?!&quot; Ranma hollered.

&quot;Come on, boy, don&#39;t be so stubborn!&quot; Genma said.  &quot;You haven&#39;t had a
proper test of your skills in months, and I don&#39;t want you to get out of
shape!&quot;

&quot;I ain&#39;t getting out of shape!  And I ain&#39;t going to Yokohama to fight
some psycho clan, either!  Hell, this is probably another one of your
stunts to get some free grub.&quot;

&quot;How dare you talk to your father that way!&quot;

Genma launched himself at Ranma, who casually kicked him through the
window and into the koi pond.  Genma-panda pulled himself out and held
up a sign that read, &quot;You&#39;ll be sorry!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, whatever,&quot; Ranma said.

Then he heard something upstairs.  A crash, followed by what sounded
like a scream...coming from Akane&#39;s room.

&quot;Akane?&quot; he called.  No response.  &quot;Aw, shit...what now?  Shampoo?  Or
maybe Kodachi again?  I don&#39;t need this right now!&quot;

Ranma began racing up the stairs to Akane&#39;s room.  He waited by the door
and tried to hear what was going on inside.  It was hard to tell, but he
thought he could hear some soft thumps and muffled cries.  Kami...was he
too late?  If someone had hurt Akane, they would have Saotome justice to
answer to, that was for sure.

&quot;Akane!  Are you OK?  What&#39;s-&quot;

As Ranma kicked the door open, he wasn&#39;t sure what he expected to see,
but what greeted his eyes was possibly the last thing he though he would
ever lay them upon.

-----

Akane was trying hard not to scream as Kodachi ravished her body.  As it
was, she had to grit her teeth and crush her bed sheets in her fists to
maintain herself.  Moans escaped her lips one after another.

&quot;Is that good for you, Akane love?&quot; Kodachi cooed.

&quot;Yes!  Yes!&quot;

Kodachi leaned forward to run her hand through Akane&#39;s hair, and they
kissed again.  Akane could taste herself in Kodachi&#39;s mouth.

&quot;Just relax,&quot; Kodachi said.  &quot;We have only begun...&quot;

The Black Rose renewed her assault on Akane&#39;s womanhood, and a scream
was stuck halfway through her vocal cords.  She tried to force it back
down, knowing Ranma, Genma, Soun, Nabiki and Kasumi were all inside the
house, and it would probably bring them all running.  But as the spasms
began to overtake her, Akane lost her control.  And for a moment, she
lost her desire even to have control.

Her body jerked uncontrollably, shaking the whole bed.  The bed bumped
into the desk, and the motion caused Kodachi&#39;s precariously-placed
mallet to fall over the edge.  It hit the floor with a loud bang.  At
the same time, Akane was overcome with passion and screamed her pleasure
out as loud as she could.

Kodachi sensed the implications of what happened quickly, and as Akane
was totally depleted of her energy, she had to act fast.  The two of
them did not hear the footsteps coming up the stairs and down the hall
as Kodachi clamped her hand over Akane&#39;s mouth, trying to keep the girl
from alerting anyone else with quiet moans.

Then there was a voice at the door, and they knew all was lost.

&quot;Akane?!  Are you OK?  What&#39;s-&quot;

The door flew open, and a battle-primed Ranma was standing there.  He
took a look at the scene before him: his fiancee and her hated enemy,
lying in bed together, sweaty, breathing fast, and...oh, completely
naked.

He had to shake his head, hoping that somehow Cologne had drugged him
again and he was hallucinating.  But when he looked again, they were
still there, still naked, and still staring at him.

&quot;Ranma, what&#39;s going on up there?&quot; asked the nervous voice of Tendo
Soun.  Ranma didn&#39;t answer; he was too busy trying to pull his jaw out
of the floor.  &quot;Ranma, what-&quot;

The older man appeared in the doorway as well, and his reaction was
just like Ranma&#39;s.  Akane and Kodachi, realizing the situation they were
in, covered themselves with the sweaty sheets.  Ranma and Soun were
joined by a soaking-wet Genma-panda, who did the panda equivalent of a
face fault.  Nabiki and Kasumi were attracted by all the attention.
Nabiki, who was eating chips, almost choked on one, while Kasumi merely
gasped and covered her mouth with her hand.

The girls were the only ones who were able to speak, and Akane and
Kodachi weren&#39;t sure which Tendo sister best expressed the collective
reaction to what they saw.

&quot;Oh my...&quot;

&quot;Well, at least Happosai left before he could see this...&quot;

End Chapter One.
