<h1>The Amazon and the Moneylender (part 13 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/thrythlind.html">Thrythlind</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/amamon-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Ukyou glanced back to make sure that Ryouga was staying put like she&#39;d 
asked. Since arriving at the hospital with Mousse and Kodachi neither 
had been given much rest, she&#39;d only just now found the space and time 
she needed to get to a phone and call the rest of the Tendo dojo. Ukyou 
sighed as she recalled the events since they had arrived at the 
hospital.

In the hour they had been stuck here, the police had questioned them, 
and accused them of a variety of things. Their first thought was that 
Ukyou and Ryouga had gotten in a fight with Mousse and Kodachi that had 
gotten out of hand, the doctors killed that one. The hospital explained 
that the injuries the pair had sustained seemed more like some sort of 
animal. Then things got REALLY crazy.

A suggestion that Mousse and Kodachi had been fighting a demon, and then 
a cry of &quot;hey careful with that or it&#39;ll just make you go all loopy,&quot; 
convinced the police to confiscate Ryouga&#39;s first aid kit. At about the 
same time someone managed to get an abridged version of the baksai 
tenketsu training from Ukyou before she realized what she was saying. 
This resulted in about a thirty second attempt to capture Ryouga, which 
he barely noticed. This had ended after Ukyou had picked up a flattened 
bullet and turned to the cop that had been talking to her and said, 
&quot;that&#39;s why I&#39;m training in the baksai tenketsu.&quot;

&quot;Tendo dojo, how may I help you?&quot; Kasumi&#39;s voice sounded a little 
strained.

&quot;Kasumi?&quot; Ukyou ignored the fact that the elder Tendo was having some 
sort of problem of her own. If she got bogged down in that then it would 
take a while to get Mousse and Kodachi&#39;s situation out. &quot;I&#39;m at the 
hospital.&quot;

&quot;Oh! Are you and Ryouga okay?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re fine, its Kodachi and Mousse...&quot; Ukyou said. &quot;They got in a fight 
with something, they&#39;re still unconscious so we don&#39;t know what yet.&quot;

&quot;Oh! Was it Kuno?&quot; Kasumi asked. &quot;Nabiki said he was around.&quot;

&quot;Kuno?&quot; Ukyou almost drapped the phone. &quot;Kuno&#39;s back?&quot;

&quot;Nabiki said that, are you okay?&quot;

&quot;Uh, yes,&quot; Ukyou said. &quot;No it wasn&#39;t Kuno, that idiot doesn&#39;t cause the 
same type of injuries. Ryo-chan thinks it was a demon, if you can 
believe that.&quot;

&quot;Oh my,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;I&#39;ll try to tell everybody else, but I&#39;m not 
certain where they are at the moment. Would you and Ryouga mind staying 
there at least until one of us arrives, oh what is the hospital?&quot;

&quot;Hey, that&#39;s no problem, sugar,&quot; Ukyou said before giving Kasumi the 
hospital&#39;s name. She clicked the phone down and walked over to Ryouga. 
&quot;Any word on the lunatics?&quot;

&quot;Not yet, are you okay?&quot; he asked, noticing her expression as she 
approached.

&quot;Kuno&#39;s back,&quot; she said, quietly, sitting next to him. Ryouga looked at 
her cautiously. Ukyou remembered that fight, she had been panicking and 
flailing about stupidly. She was worried about being groped, and let the 
thought distract her. As a result, Kuno had beaten her, badly. Kuno, the 
joke, the idiot that was always heading somewhere via air-Ranma or 
Akane. The would-be samurai had beaten her. The fact that she couldn&#39;t 
even touch him after the jerk chose to fight all out didn&#39;t help 
matters.

&quot;Are you going to try and fight him?&quot; Ryouga asked seriously. She looked 
at him and smiled slightly.

&quot;Not if I can help it,&quot; she said. &quot;Not before I finish the baksai 
tenketsu at any rate.&quot; Ryouga kept his thoughts on the matter silent, he 
REALLY didn&#39;t want to make a scene just at the moment. Later, when they 
returned to camp maybe. &quot;I wish one of these doctors would tell us 
something.&quot;

&quot;What so funny?&quot; Shampoo asked nervously as Nabiki quieted. The 
moneylender turned to face her, radiantly cheerful.

&quot;She&#39;s an Amazon!&quot; Nabiki said suddenly. Shampoo looked at her confused.

&quot;How can magical girl be Amazon, she not even born.&quot;

&quot;I was born,&quot; Ranko muttered angrily, though no one heard her.

&quot;You didn&#39;t know that?&quot; Ranma blinked and looked at Akane, who had the 
same expression.

&quot;We figured something out before Nabiki?&quot;

&quot;Oh I suspected it,&quot; Nabiki waved off the comment, trying to salvage 
some pride. &quot;But I have enough on my mind at the moment without having 
to prove that.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t get how magical girl be Amazon,&quot; Shampoo repeated.

&quot;Perhaps if the girl that drowned in the pool was an Amazon,&quot; Dr. Tofu 
suggested.

&quot;Hello!! I am sitting right here!&quot; Everybody turned to look at Ranko and 
blinked. She hmphed and crossed her arms. &quot;Jerks.&quot;

&quot;If girl drowned in pool Amazon,&quot; Shampoo said. &quot;Then anybody who fall 
in Amazon?&quot;

&quot;Hey wouldn&#39;t that mean that the outsider laws don&#39;t apply to Ranma?&quot; 
Akane asked suddenly. &quot;After all he&#39;s been walking around with an Amazon 
life force this entire time.&quot;

&quot;Shampoo ask great-grandma,&quot; the Amazon said slowly. &quot;After take Nabiki 
home, and put in BED.&quot; She emphasized the last word strongly, giving a 
Nabiki a reproachful look. Dr. Tofu, Ranko, Ranma and Akane looked on 
rather confused.

&quot;We were going to...&quot;

&quot;Shampoo stop by for lunch, Nabiki stay bed and HEAL,&quot; Shampoo whispered 
something and Nabiki laughed, actually blushing.

&quot;You&#39;re doing it again,&quot; Akane said dangerously. Shampoo and Nabiki 
suddenly turned serious and faced the other people in the clinic.

&quot;Doing what?&quot; Nabiki asked quietly. Any reply was cut off as Kasumi&#39;s 
voice was heard from the lobby. Ranma and Akane dragged Ranko away from 
Dr. Tofu while Shampoo carried Nabiki to the far side of the room. Ranma 
left the room quietly and then returned with a still paralyzed Sasuke. 
He smirked viciously as he set the ninja on the examination table

&quot;Ka-ka-Kasumi, what a surprise to meet you here of all places...&quot; he 
stammered. The Doctor reached for something to occupy his hands and 
found Sasuke. &quot;Is that you Nabiki? You really should keep better care of 
your skin.&quot; Sasuke couldn&#39;t scream as his neck was twisted, he could 
however see the very vicious smirks he was getting from the martial 
artists backed against the wall.

&quot;You work here Doctor,&quot; Kasumi noted. She looked and saw everybody 
standing away from Tofu. &quot;Oh good, you&#39;re all here.&quot; Akane and Nabiki 
noticed the slight sarcasm on the word all, though people who hadn&#39;t 
lived a life time with Kasumi probably would have missed it. &quot;Ukyou just 
called the dojo, there appears to have been an incident of some kind.&quot;

&quot;An incident,&quot; Dr. Tofu asked. &quot;Give me a moment to check Nabiki&#39;s foot 
here.&quot; His next treatment resulted in mass wincing and chuckling from 
the martial artists.

&quot;No, this cannot wait,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;Apparently Ryouga and Ukyou had to 
bring Kodachi and Mousse to the hospital. They had been in a battle of 
some kind.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; Ranma and Akane snapped.

&quot;I told them that somebody would be by, considering that Kodachi lives 
with...&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re on our way,&quot; Ranma said, heading out the door.

&quot;Hey Baka, we don&#39;t know the hospital!&quot; Akane shouted, following after 
him.

&quot;Oh my,&quot; Kasumi turned to Ranko. &quot;Would you catch up and tell them where 
to go?&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot; Ranko blinked and tried to come up with a reason she couldn&#39;t do 
that, but she seriously did not want to disappoint this girl. &quot;Sure, 
what&#39;s the hospital?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about Nabiki,&quot; Kasumi said sweetly. &quot;I&#39;ll see her home.&quot;

&quot;Hey maybe betty-chan can go with you!&quot; Dr. Tofu suggested. &quot;I&#39;ll ask 
her in a moment.&quot;

&quot;Shampoo help Nabiki home too,&quot; the Amazon said as she carried Nabiki 
out of the room from the crazy doctor.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t volunteer other people like that Ukyou,&quot; Dr. Tofu 
lectured.

&quot;How come he thinks I spatula-girl,&quot; Shampoo asked herself.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it Doctor,&quot; Nabiki called as she and Shampoo left the 
room. &quot;See you later.&quot;

&quot;My family is very lucky to have such a kind man as yourself as a 
doctor,&quot; Kasumi said, bowing as she left. &quot;I hope to see you again under 
calmer circumstances.&quot; She added the last with a serene smile and a 
demure wave.

&quot;Oh Betty-Chan, she said I&#39;m a kind man,&quot; and Dr. Tofu danced through a 
wall holding his skeleton. Left to himself was the still paralyzed 
ninja, ingenuously reshaped into a something a cat would think of as 
impossible.

&quot;I am quite capable of taking my sister home, Shampoo,&quot; Kasumi said 
calmly. &quot;And I believe that you have work.&quot; Nabiki ignored her sister, 
as far as she was concerned, Kasumi&#39;s thoughts were clear.

&quot;Want to make sure Nabiki go to bed,&quot; Shampoo hmphed.

&quot;We do agree on that, at least,&quot; Kasumi noted. She wanted to apologize 
to Nabiki for her earlier words, but not with Shampoo there. Even if she 
didn&#39;t altogether trust Shampoo, the amazon provided to easy an out for 
Nabiki to ignore her. &quot;And just how did you all end up at Dr. Tofu&#39;s 
clinic?&quot;

&quot;Kuno,&quot; Nabiki said simply. &quot;That ninja ended up catching everybody but 
me and Kuno in a cloud of paralysis powder. If Kitty here hadn&#39;t shown 
up I don&#39;t know what would have happened.&quot;

&quot;Oh my,&quot; Kasumi blinked, studiously ignoring the way Nabiki cuddled in 
Shampoo&#39;s arms at the end of that statement. &quot;It seems I owe you some 
thanks.&quot;

&quot;Stupid stick-boy,&quot; Shampoo growled. &quot;He run away before Shampoo could 
beat him. Chasing lost boy that not there, idiot.&quot; Kasumi looked at her 
sister with surprise.

She cast an illusion? Kasumi blinked. She&#39;s done much since coming back 
from China. Could she be returning to the art? It would be good news if 
that was so, Nabiki had so much potential. It was a shame that she let 
it sit unused, at least until she had returned home with sealed and 
cloaked flasks of Jusenkyo water.

&quot;Yeah, now he thinks I&#39;m a sorceress,&quot; Nabiki said, Kasumi knew the 
comment was directed at her, but Nabiki didn&#39;t turn to look at her. &quot;But 
then he thinks everything walks out of a samurai tale.&quot; Then they were 
walking into the gates of the dojo.

&quot;That is good enough, Shampoo,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;I can handle it from 
here.&quot;

&quot;Must SEE Nabiki in bed,&quot; Shampoo retorted. &quot;I don&#39;t trust her not to be 
stupid.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll be paying for that,&quot; Nabiki promised sourly. There was no way 
she was going to get anything done with both of them mothering her. She 
caught her breath as Shampoo rushed up the stairs with her. Nabiki was 
aware that they were leaving Kasumi behind at the door, and was glad of 
it. It was only moments before she was being set down gently into her 
bed. &quot;I&#39;m not made of porcelain, Shampoo.&quot;

&quot;You no martial artist either,&quot; Shampoo noted in response. &quot;Not heal so 
fast as us, so rest. Shampoo handle problems for now.&quot; They kissed, 
holding the embrace for several moments before pulling back. &quot;Besides, 
you are probably more fun when not all beaten up.&quot; Nabiki blushed again 
as the amazon repeated the encouragement she had whispered in Tofu&#39;s 
office.

&quot;Shampoo, you forgot the water of drowned girl,&quot; Nabiki snapped as 
Shampoo was about to leave. &quot;It&#39;s on the dresser there. I was going to 
give it to you at lunch, but since you&#39;re here now...&quot; Shampoo looked to 
the flask and returned to pick it up, smiling.

&quot;No more Kitty,&quot; Shampoo teased as she unstoppered the flask. She looked 
to where Nabiki was sitting on the edge of the bed, watching her.

&quot;Too late for that,&quot; Nabiki said, smirking. &quot;I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re stuck as 
Kitty.&quot; Shampoo biihed the middle Tendo as she upended the flask over 
her head. The tingle of transformation started through her body, and cut 
short. Opening her eyes Shampoo was not surprised to see her still human 
hands, she was elated. Letting out a wordless squeal of delight she 
turned to hug and kiss Nabiki again.

&quot;Cured, and if water-girl really Amazon, then Shampoo free too,&quot; the 
amazon exclaimed. &quot;Wo ai ni!&quot; Nabiki smiled but wasn&#39;t so certain that 
Cologne would accept this.

&quot;And I love you, but you have to go back before the old ghoul starts 
looking for you,&quot; Nabiki said, reluctantly letting go of Shampoo. The 
amazon nodded quietly, standing up. &quot;And if Cologne doesn&#39;t accept 
Ranko, try to stall her, a week at least.&quot;

&quot;That harder than you think,&quot; Shampoo said. &quot;But I will try. Be back for 
lunch.&quot; Shampoo was bouncing happily downstairs away from Nabiki&#39;s room 
when she noticed Kasumi waiting for her at the doorway. It appeared as 
if she had not moved since Shampoo broke away from her upon entering.

&quot;I have to tell you one thing before you go,&quot; Kasumi said in her normal 
soft tone.

&quot;What Nabiki-sister want?&quot; Shampoo asked nervously, she really didn&#39;t 
want Kasumi to dislike her. That was almost a damning comment for this 
nice woman to dislike anybody.

&quot;I shall be honest and say that Nabiki&#39;s...inclinations, while 
uncomfortable, do not surprise me much,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;And with Ranma 
having been in the house all this time, I suppose I&#39;ll accept it sooner 
or later. But I do not trust you.&quot; She paused to let that sink in. 
Shampoo was trying to figure out how she could stay so calm in attitude, 
disapproval without anger was strange to her. &quot;You are a very relentless 
young woman, and Nabiki is providing you with much to your benefit.&quot;

&quot;I am not using your sister,&quot; Shampoo said firmly.

&quot;Yes, well do try not to prove me correct,&quot; Kasumi asked politely and 
calmly, as if she were simply asking for a favor. &quot;Now, I must try to 
find where my father and Mr. Saotome went. Have a nice day.&quot; Kasumi 
smiled and walked towards the living room.

&quot;How be nice and threaten at the same time?&quot; Shampoo asked herself 
before leaving to get her bicycle and return to the Nekohanten.

Nabiki was sitting on her bed and already glaring as Kasumi walked in 
gracefully and sat down at her desk.

&quot;I can take care of myself,&quot; Nabiki said levelly, watching her sister.

&quot;Recent events would indicate otherwise,&quot; Kasumi said, indicating 
Nabiki&#39;s shoulder and foot. &quot;But I apologize for what I said earlier, if 
it is any consolation I did not mean it the way it sounded.&quot;

&quot;How else was I supposed to take it, and stop acting like I&#39;m child just 
because I made a mistake,&quot; Nabiki snapped. &quot;And this time there is no 
mistake. This time everybody gets what they want, Cologne gets to claim 
Ranma as an Amazon, Ranma and Akane can be together without 
interference, our Dads get to see the houses joined, and...I can have 
Shampoo.&quot;

&quot;Are you certain Cologne will accept whatever evidence you have?&quot; Nabiki 
shrugged in a careless manner that told Kasumi that she had a plan for 
that as well. &quot;And what will you do afterwards. Which of you is going to 
turn their backs on their obligations? This is of course, assuming that 
she is not using you.&quot;

&quot;She isn&#39;t using me,&quot; Nabiki insisted.

&quot;Yes, well try to get some sleep,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;And I mean real sleep, 
no drugs, not because you&#39;re exhausted. You need to sleep.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s too much to do,&quot; Nabiki said. &quot;I need to find Kuno again, visit 
two hospitals, and watch Cologne for her reaction to the idea that Ranko 
is an Amazon.&quot;

&quot;Then you need to plan,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;And center yourself, and for that 
you need to be rested. So do try to get some sleep.&quot; She smiled, stood 
up and walked for the door.

&quot;You don&#39;t really think that after all this time not using magic that 
I&#39;m going to suddenly become a powerful sorceress, do you?&quot; Nabiki 
asked. &quot;I don&#39;t like magic, I&#39;ve used it a couple of times recently 
because I have no choice, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to make it a 
habit.&quot; Kasumi merely smiled and continued out of the room.

&quot;Great Grandmother! I have good news!&quot;

&quot;What is that, Shampoo,&quot; Cologne asked suspiciously.

&quot;Ranma&#39;s girl side is an Amazon,&quot; she declared happily. &quot;I don&#39;t have to 
kill her now. And Ranma&#39;s an Amazon already, so I don&#39;t have to marry 
him. No more conflict with the younger Tendo!&quot;

&quot;How do you know this?&quot; Cologne asked after looking her grand-daughter 
over.

&quot;She speaks our dialect,&quot; Shampoo said, hesitantly. She had expected 
Cologne to ask for more information, but she did not expect Cologne to 
be expressing so much hostility with the idea. &quot;And Nabiki and Ranma say 
so.&quot;

&quot;And they explained how this could be?&quot;

&quot;They say that the girl that fell in the stream was an Amazon,&quot; Shampoo 
said, narrowing her eyes. &quot;So everyone that falls in that pool gains chi 
of Amazon. I&#39;m not going to kill her!&quot;

&quot;Did you think that, perhaps, they are lying to you, my child?&quot; Cologne 
asked coldly, her grand-daughter was openly defying her.

&quot;Nabiki was not lying!&quot; Shampoo didn&#39;t get it. All Cologne wanted was to 
claim Ranma as one of the tribe, she should be happy to find a loophole 
that would get him in without the necessity of a family war. The 
unreasonableness of this reaction had sparked her own stubborn nature.

&quot;And how would you know that,&quot; Cologne asked dangerously. &quot;She lies to 
her own family, what reason would she have to treat you any better.&quot; 
Shampoo blinked and backed off, then she straightened again. &quot;My 
suspicions are correct then.&quot;

&quot;I have work to do,&quot; Shampoo declared. &quot;Ranko is an Amazon, Ranma is an 
Amazon, soon maybe Akane, Nabiki and crazy-girl, if she&#39;s alive. Your 
problem is solved!&quot;

If I thought I still needed a test, I&#39;d hope someone would put me in a 
cell next to that Kuno boy,&quot; Cologne sighed. She has turned against me. 
She thought about the possibility of what she had said though. She could 
perhaps accept Ranma, but this magically created girl was a problem. If 
what Shampoo said was true, then there was an Amazon child that could 
claim to have defeated her. I wonder how she ranks up to Ranma.

Kodachi was surprised that she woke up, at least surprised that she woke 
up in the mortal world. She expected to be dead. She looked around at 
the hospital in surprise, trying to work out how she had gotten there. 
Perhaps Mousse was not so injured as she had thought he was.

&quot;Mousse?&quot; She reached down to gingerly touch the bandage along her side. 
The gymnast sat up to see a surprised Ukyou.

&quot;Well, this is a coincidence,&quot; the chef noted dryly.

&quot;It&#146;s the serving girl,&quot; Kodachi said, straightening to a dignified 
position. She felt moderately dizzy and the rip in her side sent a wave 
of pain to her head. Kodachi as usual did not allow herself to express 
the pain. Ukyou arched an eyebrow.

&quot;Doesn&#39;t that hurt?&quot; Ukyou asked, pointing at Kodachi&#39;s side.

&quot;There are standards to maintain, and I will not ignore proper 
conversational posture due to the protests of my flesh,&quot; Kodachi 
explained irritably.

&quot;Uh...riiiight.&quot;

&quot;Did you and that barbarian bring me here?&quot;

&quot;You could be more polite about it, sugar,&quot; Ukyou snapped. Ryouga was 
right, wait a minute, this is a Kuno. I&#39;ll wait to hear Mousse&#39;s report 
before I believe this demon stuff. It just seems like too much all at 
once.

&quot;Where is Mousse?&quot; Ukyou softened somewhat at the restrained worry in 
Kodachi&#39;s voice.

&quot;In another room,&quot; Ukyou said. &quot;He was in worse shape than you.&quot;

&quot;Is he....going to be okay?&quot; Kodachi asked after a moment.

&quot;The doctors thought so,&quot; Ukyou said. &quot;Neither of you are in much of a 
shape to do anything strenuous for a while, but you should recover.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Kodachi let herself relax, but maintained her posture. &quot;You 
seemed surprised when I first saw you, why is that?&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t expect you to be awake,&quot; Ukyou explained with a shrug.

&quot;Then why were you here?&quot; Kodachi asked. &quot;You obviously do not hold much 
respect for me.&quot;

&quot;Hell, no, you&#39;re a Kuno!&quot; Ukyou snapped. &quot;A family of loonies, there&#39;s 
no reason to respect any of you. But I don&#39;t know where your brother is 
and I don&#39;t want to do this while trying to avoid a haircut, besides 
you&#39;re closer.&quot;

&quot;Do what, pray tell?&quot; Kodachi asked arrogantly. &quot;Challenge my brother, 
perhaps?&quot; Ukyou blinked.

&quot;You sound happy about that,&quot; Ukyou said. &quot;I&#39;m not making the same 
mistakes this time, he&#39;s going...&quot;

&quot;...Down like the rabid dog he is,&quot; Kodachi agreed happily. She lay back 
down and smiled. &quot;I hope I can see the video.&quot;

&quot;You WANT your brother beaten?&quot; Ukyou, who hadn&#39;t yet heard the reason 
behind Kodachi&#39;s moving into the Tendo dojo, sounded disgusted. &quot;You&#39;re 
all freaks.&quot; She started to leave, as she did Kodachi sat back up again.

&quot;Kuonji-san,&quot; Ukyou paused and faced the girl again. &quot;Please come here a 
moment.&quot;

&quot;Listen lady, I am NOT anybody&#39;s servant..&quot;

&quot;It was not an order, it was a request,&quot; Kodachi said. &quot;I wish to make 
you aware of something.&quot; Ukyou narrowed her eyes and growled before 
stalking over.

&quot;This better be good, girl,&quot; the chef snapped.

&quot;I&#39;ve...only told Mousse about this,&quot; Kodachi said, glancing at her 
curled fists. She continued quietly &quot;But I think he&#39;s known. I think 
Tendo-sensai and Ranma also know, but they&#39;ve said nothing to me. I 
didn&#39;t even really kn...believe it until recent...events made 
certain...realities plain to me.&quot;

Tendo-sensai, is she training under Akane&#39;s father now? Ukyou asked 
herself. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Kodachi uncurled her hand and 
held out the palm.

&quot;What do you see there?&quot; Kodachi asked nervously. Ukyou shrugged and 
took Kodachi&#39;s hand. The chef took a quick look and blinked. She glanced 
up at Kodachi and then back down, and dropped the hand.

&quot;You have no lines on your palm,&quot; Ukyou said, shocked. &quot;What the hell 
caused that?&quot;

&quot;Training,&quot; Kodachi said after a moment. &quot;My brother expected me to be 
perfect under all circumstances. Injury, fatigue....&quot; She swallowed and 
looked away before adding the next. &quot;Heated uneven bars.&quot; Ukyou looked 
at the gymnast with unmasked shock and a little pity. &quot;Do not question 
my family loyalty, Tatewaki is the traitor, not I.&quot;

&quot;I...didn&#39;t know,&quot; Ukyou said.

&quot;Apology accepted,&quot; Kodachi said. &quot;Oh, and Kuonji-san, my brother&#39;s 
quick healing. I don&#39;t know much it, but he trained in an endurance 
exercise called Ao Dah Jong.&quot; Ukyou nodded as she backed to the side, 
letting the doctors and nurses whom had begun to arrive inside.

&quot;I&#39;ll tell Ranma and Akane you&#39;re awake,&quot; Ukyou said wearily as she left 
the room. A few minutes later she arrived in the waiting room where 
Akane was standing over an unconscious Ranma.

&quot;Can you not tease Ryouga at least ONCE in your life?!&quot; Akane shouted.

&quot;Look at him,&quot; it was that half-chinese Ranko speaking. &quot;He&#39;s wearing a 
LEASH! He&#39;s tied to a door! What isn&#39;t there to laugh about?&quot; A fuming 
Ryouga was doing his best not to lash out.

CLANG

&quot;At least the last duplicate of Ranma&#39;s girl side wasn&#39;t such a jerk!&quot; 
Ukyou snapped, glaring at the unconscious red-head.

&quot;At least she doesn&#39;t know any better,&quot; Akane hmphed. &quot;So you two are 
going back to training?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ryouga said. &quot;She&#39;s getting close to the technique, and there 
are some other things I want to teach her before...&quot; he glanced at 
Ukyou. &quot;We...uh...get back.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not going to wait for Kodachi and Mousse to wake up?&quot; Akane 
asked surprised.

&quot;Kodachi&#39;s awake,&quot; Ukyou said. &quot;And I have training to finish.&quot;

&quot;Ucchan, are you all right?&quot; Ryouga asked noticing Ukyou&#39;s contrite 
attitude.

&quot;Just something Kodachi said,&quot; Ukyou answered. The gymanst had said she 
thought that Ranma and &quot;Tendo-Sensai&quot; knew about Kodachi and her 
brother, but just in case she was wrong, Ukyou wasn&#39;t going to specify. 
&quot;Hey, do you know what Ao Dah Jong is?&quot; Ryouga paled.

&quot;It&#146;s a demon hunter thing, why do you ask that?&quot; the lost boy asked 
nervously. He knew hundreds of body hardening techniques, including that 
one, he also knew that was one of the more painful ones. It easily 
surpassed the Baksai Tenketsu for sheer pain, while not giving as much 
back. At least that was Ryouga&#39;s opinion.

&quot;Kodachi said something about Kuno knowing it,&quot; Ukyou eyed him 
carefully. &quot;What do you know about it?&quot;

&quot;Trust me, Kuno hasn&#39;t gone through that training,&quot; he nearly laughed. 
&quot;He screams too much.&quot;

&quot;Why is that?&quot;

&quot;At least we&#39;re at a hospital already,&quot; Ranma grumbled as he woke up, he 
glanced at Ranko and blinked. He suddenly had a sense of standing over 
his own body. &quot;Okay, this is weird.&quot; The red-head sat up grumbling 
irritably in Chinese at the oblivious Japanese martial artists around 
her.

&quot;Would you please be quiet, Ryouga was talking about a technique Kuno 
might know,&quot; Akane snapped at them.

&quot;Oh...&quot; all eyes turned toward Ryouga who sweatdropped.

&quot;So what is the big deal about this technique?&quot; Ukyou rephrased her 
question.

&quot;You see, the point is too deliberately cause as much pain as you can to 
the trainee,&quot; Ryouga explained. &quot;They&#39;re supposed to fix it themselves. 
Advanced training calls for you to injure yourself. To be really worth 
it you&#39;d have to start training young enough that you don&#39;t have a clear 
idea of pain.&quot; Ranma, Akane and Ukyou all thought of Kodachi.

&quot;What&#39;s the point of that?&quot; Akane asked shocked.

&quot;Increase pain tolerance and endurance,&quot; Ryouga said. &quot;Prepare a demon 
hunter for what happens when they mess up.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s probably the second stupidest thing I&#39;ve ever heard of,&quot; Ranma 
blinked.

&quot;Demon hunters do a lot of things we&#39;d think were stupid, like....&quot; 
Ryouga blinked and suddenly burst out laughing. Half the medical staff 
nearby shushed him. &quot;err...sorry.&quot; He continued laughing though.

&quot;Okay, what&#39;s so funny?&quot; Ukyou growled.

&quot;Yeah, Ryouga this is serious,&quot; Akane snapped.

&quot;What does this have to do with that stupid samurai-boy?&quot; Ranko 
demanded.

&quot;Another demon hunter &#39;body hardening&#39; technique,&quot; Ryouga giggled. &quot;Is 
faking death and unconsciousness. They&#39;re better than anybody else at 
it.&quot; The other martial artist looked at him as if he&#39;d lost it. &quot;They 
roll with a hit and just fall, they even control their chi flow to look 
dead.&quot;

&quot;You mean to tell me that Kuno&#39;s been faking going unconscious this 
entire time?&quot; Ranma blinked. &quot;That doesn&#39;t sound like the arrogant 
jerk.&quot;

&quot;It would explain why he claims you&#39;ve never beaten him,&quot; Akane sighed. 
&quot;But Nabiki used to drag him to the nurse&#39;s office all the time.&quot;

&quot;He must not be fast enough for Ranma,&quot; Ukyou shrugged. &quot;But....I&#39;m not 
that fast.&quot;

&quot;Hey, where are you two training?&quot; Akane asked, suddenly.

&quot;Mt. Terror, why?&quot; Ryouga asked.

&quot;Hey, maybe we can join you later today,&quot; Akane said. &quot;Maybe, we&#39;ll 
actually manage to get some training done.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;ll be....nice,&quot; Ukyou said after a moment. I hope they don&#39;t camp 
TOO close.

&quot;Good, now we have to go visit my student,&quot; Akane said, walking off. 
Ukyou blinked.

&quot;Wait, YOU&#39;RE &#39;Tendo-sensai?&#39;&quot; She glanced at Ranma as if to ask him how 
he could let her train Kodachi.

&quot;It seems to work,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;See you guys later.&quot; He seemed about as 
thrilled about joining them as Ukyou did.

&quot;Hmm, that&#39;s a stroke of luck!&quot; Ryouga declared.

&quot;Right what a perfect way to intrude on each other&#39;s private time,&quot; 
Ranko muttered. Ryouga and Ukyou stared at her. &quot;Oh...heh...was that in 
Japanese? Uh, I&#39;m going to catch up with them...bye!!&quot; The water girl 
disappeared after Ranma and Akane.

&quot;Huh? What was that about?&quot;

CLANG

&quot;How can you and Akane be so dense?&quot; Ukyou growled as she dragged the 
dazed martial artist out behind her.</pre>
