------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Are you certain this plan will work?&quot; Kodachi asked irritably. &quot;It has been 
tried before.&quot;

&quot;Yes but we&#39;re not delivering the food,&quot; Mousse pointed out. &quot;We&#39;ll just drop 
the drug into whatever they are drinking or eating at the moment.&quot;

&quot;This is so childishly simple,&quot; Kodachi hmphed. &quot;I don&#39;t see how it can possibly 
work.&quot;

&quot;Do you have a better idea?&quot;

&quot;Not at the moment,&quot; Kodachi admitted. &quot;But when this plan of your fails I&#39;ll be 
sure to remind you of this.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so thrilled.&quot; As they leaped away two couples stepped out from behind a 
wall.

&quot;They&#39;re going to feed Shampoo a love potion?&quot; Hiroshi and Daisuke stared at 
each other a moment and started off toward the Cat Caf&eacute;.

&quot;Where do you think you two are going!&quot; Sayuki shouted.

&quot;Oh let them go, we&#39;ll just call ahead from those pay phones over there,&quot; Yuka 
pointed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&quot;Hello, you&#39;ve reached the Tendo dojo,&quot; Kasumi answered the phone. &quot;Kodachi?&quot;

&quot;OHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!&quot;

&quot;I think I hear her coming, love potion? Okay I&#39;ll tell him, thank you.&quot; She put 
the phone down, and saw Akane passing. &quot;Oh Akane, Yuka says that Kodachi is 
going to try to slip some sort of love potion in Ranma&#39;s food.&quot;

&quot;A what?!?&quot;

&quot;Yes it makes them fall in love with the first person they see for a few hours I 
think.&quot; Akane blanched and ran into the dining room.

&quot;Ranma!! Don&#39;t eat anything!&quot; She yelled as she entered into the dining room, 
just in time to see him taking a big bite with Kodachi watching eagerly. 
Thinking fast Akane wrapped a handkerchief over his eyes.

&quot;Akane? What?&quot;

&quot;Yuka just called, she slipped something into your food.&quot; Ranma slumped.

&quot;Not another love potion.&quot;

&quot;You, Akane Tendo,&quot; Kodachi had produced her ribbon and was getting ready to 
fight. &quot;How dare you impugn my honor and cast such aspersions on my name? I, 
Kodachi Kuno the Black Rose of St. Hebereke Girl&#39;s School am above such 
dishonorable tricks.&quot;

&quot;Okay, that convinced me,&quot; Ranma muttered leaning his blindfolded head in his 
hand.

&quot;How dare you, you are a guest in this house!&quot; Soun declared, despite the fact 
her brother hadn&#39;t turned up she still hadn&#39;t gone back to her family&#39;s estate.

&quot;I PAY RENT!!&quot; Akane looked at her father.

&quot;She&#39;s not serious is she?&quot; Ranma asked. Soun and Genma looked embarrassed.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Genma noted. &quot;But she is still trying to drug you&#39;re beloved Ranma 
with a love potion.&quot;

&quot;Give it a rest and stop pushing, Pop.&quot;

&quot;Well, Akane Tendo, shall we settle this slander here and now?&quot; Akane orbit 
kicked the gymnast through the roof. &quot;CHEEAAPPP SHOTTT!!!!!&quot;

&quot;Now what&#39;s this about charging her rent?&quot;

&quot;Well, Akane, you know we need the money.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re sheltering her that pig of a brother of hers, and you CHARGE her for it?&quot; 
Soun burst into a shame filled wail as Genma shrugged.

&quot;Now, I understand where Nabiki gets it,&quot; Ranma muttered. Everybody shifted 
nervously knowing that Nabiki was still gone to wherever she had left two weeks 
ago.

&quot;Sometimes I wonder who the adults are here,&quot; Akane muttered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&quot;You&#39;re late, boy,&quot; Cologne commented as Mousse walked into the Cat Caf&eacute;.

&quot;Maybe if you actually paid me, I&#39;d be here on time.&quot; The phone ringed.

&quot;Don&#39;t push your luck boy, Cat Caf&eacute;. Love Potion? I see, would you hold please,&quot; 
Cologne turned to see where Shampoo was eating her lunch, of course Mousse was 
right where she&#39;d see him first. Moments later Mousse was through the roof and 
there was a bag over Shampoo&#39;s head.

&quot;Hey!&quot;

&quot;Why put bag over head?&quot; Shampoo started to take it off when her 

great-grandmother thumped her on the head. &quot;Oww!&quot;

&quot;Mousse slipped some love potion in your food, so leave the bag on for now.&quot;

&quot;He what? Grrr&#133;stupid Mousse.&quot; Cologne picked up the phone again.

&quot;I assume the Kuno girl is attempting something similar at the Tendo dojo? I 
thought as much. Thank you.&quot; She hung up the phone and picked it back up and 
dialed. &quot;Kasumi Tendo? I assume Kodachi has already been and gone? Good, I&#39;m 
bringing Shampoo over, I think we should pool our resources for when those two 
come back.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Ukyou heard the phone ring again and rolled her eyes.

&quot;Almost found it!&quot; Ukyou flipped her soon to be Okonomiyaki and restrained 
herself from glaring at the amused costumers. Then phone ringed for maybe the 
tenth time. &quot;I&#39;m getting closer!&quot; Ryouga&#39;s voice came from the storage area 
somewhere. The phone rang.

&quot;Kamisama! You started five feet from it!&quot;

The phone rang and cut off.

&quot;Found it!&quot;

&quot;Finally,&quot; Ukyou grumbled, rapid cooking another okonomiyaki.

&quot;Akane wants to know if we can come over to the dojo,&quot; Ryouga called.

&quot;Why?&quot; Ukyou asked, suspiciously. She remained a little jealous of Akane Tendo.

&quot;Guard duty, Kodachi and Mousse slipped some sort of drug into Ranma and 
Shampoo&#39;s food.&quot;

&quot;A love potion I guess,&quot; she mumbled to herself, then called back. &quot;I guess we 
can pop by after we close Ucchan&#39;s.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Ken woke up as soon as he felt something cold and sharp pressed against his 
throat. He rolled his eyes up to look into the face of a rather anger looking 
woman leaning over him. She looked somewhat familiar, but the sun behind her 
drowned out the details of her face.

&quot;Where do I know you from?&quot; he asked, not in the least worried.

&quot;Where did you learn about that drug?&quot; she demanded.

&quot;Drug? You mean the Breath of Nightmares?&quot; The girl pressed her blade down a 
little harder.

&quot;It&#146;s a family secret, so what are you doing with it?&quot; Her head moved and 
obscured the sun, revealing more of her face.

&quot;The girl from the airplane,&quot; he laughed. &quot;Following me all the way to 
Jusenkyo?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve caused my family a lot of trouble, I&#39;d follow you over the world if I 
had to.&quot; She had actually heard him mention Jusenkyo, cut ahead and had been 
waiting for the last two days, but he didn&#39;t need to know that.

&quot;Your family?&quot; he asked, then noticed some of the make-up giving her the tan was 
dried and flaking off. Her hair was longer as well, and only partially blonde in 
places. His eyes narrowed, &quot;You. A little out of your depths, aren&#39;t you? You&#39;re 
deadly as a plotter, Nabiki, not so good at fighting.&quot;

&quot;I have things fairly well in hand at the moment.&quot; Ken laughed and rolled over, 
letting the knife stab past his neck and into the ground. Nabiki didn&#39;t have 
time to do more than start to react. Then she was under Ken.

&quot;Do you? Looks fairly bad for you right now.&quot; The knife came out of the ground 
and laid against her face. &quot;Now what were you planning to do with this?&quot; Nabiki 
spit in his face.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&quot;Why Shampoo chained to chair?&quot; the blue-haired girl demanded angrily.

&quot;Look at this, you&#39;ve got me agreeing with Shampoo!&quot; Ranma shouted from the next 
room.

&quot;Until whatever drug the Kuno girl put in your ramen wears off,&quot; Cologne 
answered simply, then lifting her bowl up to drink some of the broth held in it. 
&quot;Or until the son-in-law agrees to my plan.&quot;

&quot;Is good idea!&quot; Shampoo agreed vehemently.

&quot;NOT A CHANCE!&quot; Akane and Ranma shouted simultaneously.

&quot;What harm would it do for Shampoo to be drugged into loving each other when 
they already do.&quot;

&quot;I think you&#39;re wrong on two fronts there,&quot; Ukyou mumbled, she was sitting quite 
a bit out of Shampoo&#39;s possible line of sight.

&quot;The plan has merits,&quot; Soun agreed. &quot;Even if the old girl has the wrong pair in 
mind. What do you say Genma?&quot;

&quot;Yes perhaps Akane and Ranma should cement their true love with this drug.&quot; 
Ranma almost retorted, fortunately Akane beat him to the punch, shouting from 
the room with the girls.

&quot;How can you call it true love if it comes out of a chemical!&quot;

&quot;What she said!&quot; Ranma agreed.

&quot;Shampoo kill crazy-girl and stupid-Mousse!&quot; She hopped up and down in the chair 
she was chained too as she declared this.

&quot;I&#39;ll help you there!&quot;

&quot;Maybe tomorrow,&quot; Ukyou told her, jabbing at her bowl of ramen and wishing it 
was an okonomiyaki. She narrowed her eyes, &quot;Why haven&#39;t I heard Ryouga in there 
recently?&quot;

&quot;I believe he left to get a soda,&quot; Soun called back. &quot;Though that was quite a 
while ago.&quot;

&quot;HE WHAT!?!&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&quot;Where did they move that blasted kitchen?&quot; Ryouga scratched his head and turned 
about to get a fix on his location. At least that&#39;s what he called it.

&quot;A WILD BOAR!! A WILD BOAR IS COMING!!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Ryouga looked behind him in time to see a terror stricken pig stop about 
ten feet away from him and then start running in panic the other way. &quot;Oh 
no&#133;Ukyou&#39;s going to kill me.&quot;

&quot;Hey, that kid is back. Are you still looking for Furinkan High?&quot; At about that 
point Ryouga&#39;s newest piece of travelling gear started ringing at his side, he 
hesitantly grabbed the phone and held it to his ear.

&quot;Hello?&quot; he asked nervously.

&quot;RYOUGA-NO-BAKA!!&quot; the townspeople around Ryouga jumped a step back as Ukyou&#39;s 
enraged voice coming over the mobile phone.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&quot;And who do we target first,&quot; Mousse asked Kodachi.

&quot;Perhaps we should start with Shampoo,&quot; Kodachi suggested.

&quot;Why her, you finally have Ranma where you want him.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Ranma,&quot; he looked at her. &quot;How many times has he fallen for this trick.&quot;

&quot;It is not wise too delay, Saotome and Akane have been getting much closer since 
the Copycat Ken incident.&quot;

&quot;My Ranma-Darling would never fall such a&#133;a&#133;common&#133;girl.&quot;

&quot;Saotome is much more common and banal than she is.&quot;

&quot;Hmph, the way your lovely Shampoo keeps moping about and sniping at that 
usurer, one would almost think that&#39;s her direction of interest.&quot;

&quot;How dare you even suggest that!&quot;

&quot;Have I, perhaps struck to close to home?&quot; Mousse&#39;s eyebrows arched angrily 
behind his glasses.

&quot;Oh and your cross-dressing love is the epitome of manliness?&quot;

&quot;Cross-dressing?! Why, I never!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you know a Jusenkyo curse when you see one?&quot;

&quot;What the devil are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s just trigger the love potions and argue about this later.&quot;

&quot;Yes, we&#39;ll take them both at once.&quot;

&quot;So Shampoo and Ranma have been given love potions, huh?&quot; Both martial artists 
looked down to see Happosai. &quot;Looks like its time to give Ranma a little bath?&quot; 
He rubbed his palms together and smiled perversely, then he leapt off towards 
the dojo. &quot;Ladies here I come!&quot;

&quot;Happosai?&quot;

&quot;Is that old pervert man voice?&quot;

&quot;Hmm this just got a little bit more complicated didn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;What&#146;s the old freak doing there!!&quot;

&quot;What is the master ever doing anywhere?&quot;

&quot;Ahh!! What did he do that for?&quot;

&quot;North, Ryouga, North!&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t us arguing how the rest of them learned about this plan?&quot; Kodachi asked, 
genuinely curious.

&quot;Stop the freak, get Shampoo and Ranma to fall in love with us, then argue.&quot; 
Mousse leaped off the roof and towards what was about to be total chaos. &quot;Don&#39;t 
worry Shampoo, I&#39;ll save you from that wretched troll.&quot; Kodachi shrugged and 
followed.

&quot;Ranma-Darling, it is Kodachi your love! OHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!&quot;

&quot;Old freak get off Shampoo!&quot;

&quot;Akane dear, I&#39;m so happy to see you!&quot;

&quot;Die, old man!&quot;

&quot;Aaackk!&quot;

&quot;Take the third fork Ryouga, the third fork!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Shampoo I&#39;m here to save you, aren&#39;t you supposed to be in that 
chair blindfolded?&quot;

&quot;Let go of me, boy, I&#39;m&#133;.not that way!&quot;

&quot;KAMISAMA! I swear the only place you don&#39;t get lost is our bed!&quot; The chaos 
stopped, everybody looked towards the oblivious Ukyou, even those that still 
couldn&#39;t see.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Ryouga blinked and pulled the phone away from him for a moment and looked at it.

&quot;Ukyou, where are you?&quot;

&quot;The Tendo dojo with&#133;.every&#133;one&#133;.else. Excuse me, I&#39;ll call right back.&quot; She 
hung up on him, for once he actually preferred his current position to hers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Ukyou turned beat red and turned to face everybody else.

&quot;Heh&#133;heh&#133;.I didn&#39;t just say that out loud, did I?&quot;

&quot;Out with it girl,&quot; Happosai chuckled. &quot;We want all the sordid details.&quot; 
Happosai was hit with multiple orbit kicks and was for the moment no longer a 
problem. Kodachi gestured to Mousse while the others were distracted.

&quot;Always knew spatula girl tramp,&quot; Shampoo declared unaware of the pair sneaking 
up around her.

&quot;I&#39;m not a tramp!&quot;

&quot;Is not married, is tramp!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re one to talk you&#133;&quot;

&quot;Hey what do you think you&#39;re doing!&quot; Akane rammed Mousse out of the way as 
Kodachi was removing the blind fold from Shampoo&#39;s eyes and Mousse was working 
on the chains.

&quot;Finally, Shampoo no wear stupid&#133;Shampoo never notice how beautiful Akane is.&quot; 
For the second time all sound battle ceased. She leaped from the chair, glomped 
Akane. &quot;Wo ai ni.&quot;

&quot;Shampoo what do you think you&#39;re&#133;mmph?!!?&quot; Akane was silenced by Shampoo&#39;s 
kiss. Suddenly Akane understood exactly how Ranma felt when Sanzenin had kissed 
him.

&quot;Good thing the master isn&#39;t still here,&quot; Genma commented.

&quot;What&#39;s that psycho doing to Akane!!!&quot; Ranma-Chan shouted angrily.

&quot;Sh-Shampoo?&quot; Mousse fainted.

&quot;Hey you&#133;unhand my daughter!&quot; Soun launched an attack and forced Shampoo back.

&quot;You is obstacle and obstacles is for killing!&quot; Shampoo declared as she launched 
forward at Soun. Ukyou noticed Kodachi trying to sneak off towards where Ranma 
was and stopped her with a slice of the spatula. Akane just stared blankly in 
shock, hair standing on end in places, and pupils shrunk to pin pricks.

&quot;Kodachi, this is your mess,&quot; Ukyou was glad the attention was off her suddenly. 
&quot;Perhaps you can help fix it.&quot;

&quot;Me, how could I help you?&quot;

&quot;Sleep powders? Perhaps?&quot; Genma suggested.

&quot;I see, that might be a good idea.&quot; She handed Ukyou two packages. The chef 
stared at the gymnast doubtfully. &quot;Mousse suggested I cut down.&quot;

&quot;I wonder why I didn&#39;t think of that before?&quot; Cologne asked herself as Ukyou 
blew some powder into Shampoo&#39;s face.

&quot;But Shampoo no want to sleep, Shampoo want to&#133;zzzz.&quot;

&quot;Hmm it must have been just a general love potion,&quot; Cologne noted calmly, 
outwardly only a little concerned.

&quot;Uhh&#133;.Sure!! That&#39;s it!&quot; Ukyou agreed after a moment.

&quot;What&#39;s happenin&#133;zzz&quot; Ranma-chan started before Genma tossed sleep powder into 
his face as well.

&quot;This was certainly unexpected.&quot; Kodachi noted blandly. Akane blinked and then 
screamed, exiting the room long enough to retrieve a bokken from the main dojo.

&quot;SHE&#39;S GOING TO PAY!!&quot;

&quot;Whoah, Akane,&quot; Akane stared at Ukyou for a moment. &quot;It was a love potion, his 
fault.&quot; The okonomiyaki chef pointed at the reawakening Mousse.

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Akane agreed apologetically, before suddenly filling up on rage 
again and beating on Mousse until he fainted again. &quot;That&#39;ll teach him.&quot;

&quot;Owww&#133;&quot; came the blind martial artists semi-conscious groan from beneath her. 
Fortunately for Mousse Akane had deliberately held back from causing real 
damage, just lots of pain.

&quot;I told him this wouldn&#39;t work from the beginning,&quot; she sniffed. Akane glared at 
her.

&quot;And what makes you think you&#39;re getting off this?&quot; Akane snapped. &quot;You were 
after Ranma after all.&quot;

&quot;He loves me already, what do I need drugs for?&quot; Akane rolled her eyes as she 
walked out of the room, almost stalking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
A few hours later Shampoo woke up with a slight headache. She stretched, yawn 
and scratched her head. She looked around and realized that she wasn&#39;t at home.

&quot;Why Shampoo at Ranma&#39;s home?&quot; she asked herself. &quot;That was strange dream.&quot;

&quot;What dream was that grand-daughter?&quot;

&quot;Pervert-girl kiss Shampoo,&quot; and she looked confused, not very troubled, but 
thoroughly confused. &quot;Strange dream.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t a dream,&quot; Cologne told her. Shampoo blinked.

&quot;I go kill Akane,&quot; she was surprised when Cologne stopped her.

&quot;She didn&#39;t kiss you, you kissed her. Mousse&#39;s love potion was off target.&quot;

&quot;I go kill Mousse, then.&quot; She turned to look at the unconscious form of the 
master of hidden weapons.

&quot;Wait until he wakes up from Akane&#39;s beating, and get ready for&#133;&quot;

&quot;SHAMPOO DID WHAT?!?&quot;

&quot;&#133;.Ranma&#39;s reaction.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you let me miss that!&quot; Happosai&#39;s voice wailed. There was the 
sound of several thuds and a strangled cry of pain.

&quot;WHAT GAVE YOU THE BRIGHT IDEA TO TELL HIM ABOUT IT!&quot; this was followed by the 
sound a panda in pain. Shampoo sweatdropped.

&quot;Shampoo go back home now,&quot; she said quietly.

&quot;Hmmm, this could be interesting,&quot; Cologne said to herself. &quot;Yes, that might be 
a good idea.&quot; After Shampoo left Cologne nudged Mousse.

&quot;Huh, what?&quot;

&quot;If I were you boy,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;d be leaving right now.&quot;

&quot;THIS IS ALL MOUSSE&#39;S FAULT!&quot; Mousse sweat dropped.

&quot;Why are you helping me?&quot; he asked before leaving.

&quot;I&#39;d rather not see Shampoo or the son-in-law charged with murder.&quot; He sweat 
dropped and was about to leave.

&quot;You want to hurt him, you&#39;ll have to go through me!&quot; Mousse stopped, turned 
around again and slumped. Then he rushed to the other room. Cologne arced an 
eyebrow.

&quot;Stop, stop I&#39;m here.&quot; Akane glared at him, Ranma looked about ready to tear him 
to pieces. Genma-panda was unconscious over to the side holding a sign that 
read, &quot;Oww..&quot;

&quot;Are you crazy,&quot; Kodachi asked him, ribbon in hand. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be running?&quot;

&quot;And let you shoulder all the blame, that would really impress Shampoo wouldn&#39;t 
it?&quot;

&quot;Shampoo, Shampoo! Always Shampoo! What anybody can see in that blue-haired 
bimbo I&#39;ll never understand.&quot;

&quot;Oh, and you think that womanizing, muscle-bound Saotome is such a great catch?&quot; 
Akane and Ranma blinked and looked at each other.

&quot;Aren&#39;t we supposed to be getting mad at them?&quot; Akane asked.

&quot;And to think I ever worried about an insolent fool like you!&quot;

Worry about me!&quot; Mousse paused and his voice calmed down. &quot;When did you worry 
about me?&quot; Kodachi winced and blushed feverishly.

&quot;Oh&#133;don&#39;t pay any attention to that, I was just excited.&quot;

&quot;Hey, over here!&quot; Ranma shouted.

&quot;You didn&#39;t think I could beat Copycat Ken!&quot; Mousse realized suddenly.

&quot;He did beat you once before,&quot; Kodachi noted, a little smugly.

&quot;I had him running last time!&quot; It had actually been more like a draw, but try 
telling Mousse that.

&quot;Can they even hear us?&quot;

&quot;Well no one was there to witness it were they?&quot;

&quot;Even Akane beat Ken!&quot;

&quot;Hey! What do you mean by that?&quot;

As the argument continued, Ranma and Akane had ceased putting in their own 
complaints and sat down watching the two exchange insults awhile Soun and 
Genma-panda played Shogi and Kasumi prepared dinner.

&quot;We don&#39;t sound like that do we?&quot; Akane asked.

&quot;Noble brat!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think anything could get this boring.&quot; Ranma muttered.

&quot;Blind idiot!&quot;

Kasumi and the two fathers glanced at Ranma and Akane quickly and then returned 
to watching the argument.

&quot;What?&quot; Ranma and Akane asked them.

&quot;Baka!&quot;

&quot;Crazy!&quot;

&quot;Fine, if you feel that way, I do not see why I should stand here and take 
that!&quot;

&quot;Fine, I&#39;m going home! See you tomorrow!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll catch you at work then!&quot; They both hmphed, turned back to back and 
stampeded off, completely unaware of the implications of their last angry 
outbursts.

&quot;Weren&#39;t we going to do something when they finished?&quot; Akane asked.

&quot;Its been an hour of listening to them shout at each other,&quot; Ranma answered. &quot;I 
almost forgot my name twice.&quot; They stood up and stretched while Soun and 
Genma-panda played shogi. 

&quot;Oh, where did Cologne get to.&quot; 

&quot;She went back to the Cat Caf&eacute;,&quot; Genma-panda&#39;s sign read.

&quot;Oh that&#39;s right,&quot; Akane declared wearily. &quot;I wanted to talk to Shampoo.&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;ll go along with that.&quot; They both narrowed their eyes.

&quot;Dinner&#39;s ready,&quot; Kasumi called.

&quot;Tomorrow,&quot; Akane suggested. &quot;Should be interesting.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I wonder what Shampoo will do to Mousse.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&quot;What do you mean the sun isn&#39;t setting yet?&quot; Ukyou asked with mock annoyance. 
She had lost the initial annoyance Ryouga&#39;s getting lost produced, and a lot had 
been burned off by her embarassment earlier. Now all that was left was 
attempting to get Ryouga home in under a week. Then she could tease him about it 
later and of course teasing led to&#133;.she blushed and got back to the problem at 
hand. &quot;You didn&#39;t get lost in a building or anything did you?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, there was this one really small one with a loud air conditioner,&quot; a sea&#39;s 
distance away Ukyou smacked her head.

&quot;What is it with him and airplanes,&quot; she asked herself. &quot;Okay, well it should be 
still past noon where you are, I hope, so just walk away from the sun.&quot;

&quot;Uh, hold on a moment, Ukyou,&quot; Ryouga set the phone to the side and cracked his 
knuckles. &quot;Baksai Tenketsu Wave!!&quot; The cliff face in front of him vanished in 
series of explosions. As the last explosion was fading off he heard what sounded 
like people.

&quot;Ryouga have you ever heard of going around the geography rather than through 
it?&quot;

&quot;Ukyou I think someone was on that cliff face!&quot;

&quot;Oh shit! Go! Go!&quot; Ryouga was already hanging up and running through the newly 
created pass. He came out on the edge of a vast field of familiar pools with 
bamboo pools. The water of the nearest pool was stained red, blood red and the 
pool was half-sheared, half snapped at the top.

&quot;Hello?&quot; He turned to look back at the pile of rubble and saw someone 
half-covered in boulders. He rushed over and from there it didn&#39;t take long to 
uncover the only shallowly buried person. &quot;Nabiki?&quot; She was beaten and cut, and 
not dressed in her usual attire at all. She was in fact dressed much more like 
that ninja freak of Kuno&#39;s did, some sort of ninja night suit that had been cut 
into ribbons in the fall. He avoided looking too closely at the remains of her 
body, fainting from embarrassment wouldn&#39;t be a good thing right now.

Ryouga didn&#39;t pause to wonder what she was doing here. He checked her pulse and 
removed a bandana from his head. With the same hand he grabbed his canteen and 
pulled the cap off with his teeth. Damping the bandana he started to clean her 
wounds.

&quot;Good pulse,&quot; he mumbled. Nabiki groaned, apparently coming to, as he wiped her 
face. He started upon seeing the cut clearly. &quot;That was a knife.&quot; Nabiki&#39;s eyes 
fluttered open, but the focused motion showed she was still largely unaware of 
what was going on around her. He noticed that her right arm was twisted 
awkwardly, obviously broken, and it was something that could have happened in 
the rock fall but wasn&#39;t likely.

Reasonably certain that she wasn&#39;t going to die on him anytime soon, Ryouga 
scanned the area for the form of whoever else had to have been up there. His 
eyes latched onto the bloody spring and nodded grimly. Whoever it was had 
impaled themselves on that pool in falling off the cliff. They had then fallen 
into the spring. He looked down as Nabiki blinked away the last of her 
confusion. The girl suddenly fixxed him with such a vicious glare that he 
flinched.

&quot;GET AWAY FROM FREAK!&quot; She punched upward and caught the surprised Ryouga across 
the jaw. She tried to stand up and then fell down again, her legs battered in 
the fall.

&quot;Nabiki, I&#39;m Ryouga,&quot; the lost boy declared she fixxed him with that glare 
again.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you just kill me?&quot; Ryouga winced again, Nabiki was vindictive and 
bitter about a lot of things, but he couldn&#39;t remember doing anything that 
warranted this kind of behavior.

&quot;Nabiki, whoever you were fighting they fell into that pool over there,&quot; Ryouga 
pointed. &quot;Now maybe its time to get you to the nearest hospital.&quot; Nabiki 
frowned.

&quot;You don&#39;t expect me to fall for this, do you Ken?&quot;

&quot;Copycat Ken,&quot; he thought, that explains why she doesn&#39;t believe I&#39;m me. &quot;Nabiki 
if I were Ken why would I need to trick you right now?&quot; He looked back at the 
pool and saw a body coming to the surface, and walked over towards it, planning 
to pull the body out. Nabiki&#39;s punch drunk mind worked rapidly over the facts 
and came at last to the correct conclusion.

&quot;It&#39;s Jusenkyo! Don&#39;t go in the water!&quot; Ryouga halted and watched as the blood 
red pool swallowed Copycat Ken&#39;s, he could recognize it now, body again, then 
the water smoothed to a preternatural calm. The water suddenly looked like it 
was just waiting for someone to come to it. He turned back to face Nabiki who 
spoke with her usual manner, as if everything she said was obvious and it was a 
pain to have to explain it. If it weren&#39;t for the visible injuries, and an 
occasional gasp or pant, he could have sworn that she was fine.

&quot;The Amazon village is not far,&quot; she said. The girl noticed the mobile phone in 
its belt pouch. It was one of those new satellite things that could be reached 
almost anywhere. It was most certainly Ukyou&#39;s idea.

&quot;Medical care first,&quot; Ryouga insisted. He walked over to her and bent over to 
pick her up.

&quot;What are you doing? Let go of me!&quot; Nabiki shouted angrily, ineffectually and 
painfully resisting with her good arm and as much motion as her bruised legs 
would allow. &quot;You&#39;ll get us lost!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not going to walk there like this,&quot; he answered. &quot;Now just keep still 
before you kill us both. Point and I&#39;ll go that way, okay?&quot;

&quot;Put me down, now! I can walk well enough.&quot; She declared. Ryouga hesitated a 
moment and set her down. She glared at him and walked a couple of steps, 
faltering only once. When Ryouga moved forward to keep her from falling she 
glared at him. &quot;Stay there, I can walk there fine.&quot;

&quot;At least use the walking stick with my gear,&quot; he pointed to the pile on her 
left. &quot;You&#39;re going to kill yourself.&quot; He saw the knife slash down the right 
side of her face start to bleed, as if someone had drawn a red tear line from 
the corner of her eye. He tossed a bandana over to her. &quot;And try to keep that 
against your face.&quot; Nabiki took both offered items and limped slowly, painfully 
and stubbornly through the rubble.

Shampoo was looking forward to tomorrow when Mousse showed up for work the next 
day. Cologne had told her to make sure that he could still work, but she also 
gave her blessing to make work as hellish as she wanted. As long as business 
didn&#39;t suffer.

Shampoo yawned as she finished cleaning up from the day&#39;s business. It was odd, 
but the memory of kissing Akane did not disturb her as much as she would have 
thought. It was still somewhat fuzzy in her memory, perhaps that was due to that 
crazy-girl&#39;s sleep powder. Shampoo finished wiping down the table and sat down, 
staring off into space for a moment.

She yawned as she went over the events in her head again, the memories must have 
been warped by the day&#39;s fatigue, because it seemed more like a dream. This time 
Shampoo wasn&#39;t the only participant in the kiss, and the girl didn&#39;t exactly 
seem to be Akane this time. This girl was taller, had a slimmer build, brown 
hair and not black. In fact this girl bore a strong resemblance to&#133;.

&quot;Nabiki?&quot; Shampoo muttered softly. The girl pulled away and smiled that sly grin 
of the money-girl&#39;s.

&quot;Wake up, girl,&quot; Cologne snapped passing through the lobby. Shampoo&#39;s head 
popped up from the table. 

&quot;Shampoo awake!!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re almost finished, try to hold out a long enough to walk to your bed.&quot;

&quot;Yes great-grandmother,&quot; she answered cheerfully. Then the young amazon wiped 
off the last table and walked off to bed yawning. &quot;Why I think about that stupid 
greedy money-girl?&quot; she asked herself.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ukyou leaped at the phone when it rang. She had been pacing back and forth 
anxiously since Ryouga had last hung up to go see if he had buried some poor 
tourist alive.

&quot;Hello?Ryougaisthatyou?Aretheystillalive?&quot;

&quot;Hi Ukyou,&quot; Ryouga answered sheepishly.

&quot;Ryouga, where are you? Did you kill any one? What&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ree in Shampoo&#39;s home town, I think. I found Nabiki.&quot; Ukyou hadn&#39;t expected 
that, she blinked. &quot;And Copycat Ken. Ken&#39;s dead.&quot;

&quot;Copycat Ken? She took on Ken! Nabiki can&#39;t fight! How is she?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s in pretty bad shape, physically&quot; Ryouga said. Ukyou paused, Ryouga had 
specified her physical condition.

&quot;How does she sound?&quot;

&quot;Fine...now,&quot;

&quot;Now?&quot;

&quot;Well, before we got here she was...,&quot; he took a moment to find the proper word. 
&quot;...irrational.&quot; Ukyou didn&#39;t answer for nearly a full second.

&quot;Is she awake?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, do you want to talk to her?&quot; She answered an affirmative and waited for 
the phone to be passed over.

&quot;Ukyou? How&#39;s the restaurant?&quot; She sounded tired, but otherwise it was the same 
dry somewhat bored voice she always used.

&quot;Nabiki, is Ryouga there?&quot;

&quot;No, your boyfriend is outside where he is trying to avoid getting into any 
fights.&quot;

&quot;What happened with Ken?&quot; There was a long pause.

&quot;An error in judgement,&quot; Nabiki answered flatly. The moneylender was thinking &quot;I 
should have just killed him while he slept.&quot;

&quot;What did he do?&quot;

&quot;What do you think he did? He would have killed me if it weren&#39;t for that 
walking earthquake of yours.&quot; Nabiki was aware of blanks in the story, but she 
didn&#39;t consider them too deeply. It had been one large mistake, better to leave 
the blanks alone.

&quot;Are you going to be okay?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine, but one thing, Ukyou.&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;About me and Shampoo,&quot; There was a muffled sound of disgust from the other end 
and Nabiki frowned. &quot;Leave her alone, she loves Ranma...not me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll lay off the cat, if she lays off me,&quot; Ukyou agreed, she decided not to 
tell Nabiki about today&#39;s events. Nabiki had already had a bad enough day.

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Nabiki agreed.

&quot;Should I tell everybody you&#39;re coming back?&quot; The moneylender fiddled with one 
of with a canteen she had pulled from her bag.

&quot;Sure, I have everything I need here. Break it to them easy.&quot;
