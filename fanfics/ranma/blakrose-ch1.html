<h1>Black Rose, Blue Thunder (part 1 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	It was raining in Nerima.
	To the citizens of this nominally unusual district in
Tokyo rain was an annoyance they had become used to. The
rain came as often as the scattered brawls caused by the
various martial artists who resided in the area. But unlike the
martial artists the rain would disappear. And when it did a
most enjoyable peace would fill the air.
	Today it had rained. And when the rain cleared
away a peaceful lull did indeed embrace the community.
	It was a lull that lasted precisely five seconds before
being disturbed by a sight that even the oldest citizen of
Nerima would find bizarre. The sight of a flying pig fighting
two very angry looking girls wearing huge backpacks.
	There was no doubt about it. The pig was flying and it
was flying with a very good pair of white feathered wings
which had the span of an eagle. Without the wings the pig
itself looked normal. It was your average pink pig. Except
that it had those huge wings. Well, that and the fact it was
fighting the two girls.
	The girl leading the attack was svelte with a trim
athletic figure. She had her long raven hair pulled back into a
high ponytail and wore a face of certain irritation which
conveyed itself clearly in her flashing violet eyes. Her clothes
consisted of a pair of dusty black pants which covered what
looked to be a violet uniform she wore under it. From what
could be seen of it the uniform looked to be that of a gymnast
leaving the crowd to assume that&#39;s what she was. Covering
the top of the leotard was a silk violet Chinese style jacket
that had an embroidered black rose on the back. The gymnast
was currently involved with trying to wrap the flying pig up in
a ribbon that matched the color of her top.
	As the gymnast did this her companion, an incredibly
statuesque girl with white blonde hair and glowing cobalt
eyes, dodged the dive bomb attacks from the flying pig as she
tried to grab it. The blonde had her hair pulled back in a
pigtail which somehow seemed to accent her exotic beauty.
And those watching her stared closely at her sharp features
and wondered about the slightly pointed edges her ears had.
Unlike her friend the blonde dressed entirely in Chinese style
clothing that consisted of a short sleeved red silk shirt and
black tie off pants. Out of the two, the blonde appeared to be
the exalting the most in this mutual attack on their strange
foe. As she leapt about trying to catch the flying pig she
moved with such speed that it was difficult to track her
movements. In such a motion, the blonde bounded into the air
to leap onto the flying pig&#39;s back.
	The flying pig paused in its flight before it released a
horrifying squeal of anger then flew high into the atmosphere
with the blonde clinging to it. It was deathly silent for several
minutes, when suddenly the blonde came plummeting out of
the sky still holding onto the flying pig&#39;s back. They hit the
ground with a thunderous crash and upon their landing the
gymnast quickly ran to the blonde&#39;s side.
	&quot;Darling!&quot; the gymnast cried as she gently pulled the
blonde into her lap. &quot;Are you injured?&quot;
	&quot;Nah,&quot; said the blonde with a low groan. She slowly
pushed herself up in the gymnast&#39;s grip and when she did so
she paused to kick the now unconscious flying pig. &quot;Stupid
pig!&quot; she declared indignantly. Shifting her attention back to
the gymnast she said, &quot;I got him to crash and take most of the
impact. Pretty good, huh?&quot;
	&quot;Very good,&quot; said gymnast tenderly as she helped the
blonde to her feet. &quot;He certainly deserved it after trying to
force another one of his idiotic engagements onto you. No
doubt it came about due to something as simple as a meal,
which we can easily charm our way into obtaining. I have to
wonder about the logistics of your genetics darling. I&#39;m hard
pressed in believing that this pig is your sire.&quot;
	&quot;You and me both,&quot; said the blonde with a snort as
she kicked the flying pig in the side. &quot;What a pain.&quot; Lifting
her cobalt gaze she asked, &quot;So we&#39;re gonna cut out right? I
bet if we dump him off and get back on track we can still
make good time. The department of social services might
even be open. We could probably get a few scams in before
the night is over and score a free meal maybe.&quot;
	&quot;That is very true,&quot; the dark haired gymnast said in
consideration as she adjusted the large backpack she wore.
&quot;Although I am pondering about visiting these people... the
Tendos is it? I dread to mention it but trouble does seem to
have a habit of following us. It would be advisable to at least
see what sort of hold they claim to have before moving on.
Added to that fact they could be of some use to us. At the
very least they should provide us with food and shelter for the
night. I myself would enjoy experiencing the pleasure of a
comfortable night of indoor rest again while we continue our
search.&quot;
	&quot;I suppose,&quot; the blonde said slowly. &quot;After all, the last
thing I need is another person chasing after me cause of Pop&#39;s
blundering. I bet my brother is doing a whole lot better
without having him around. Those three girls that went after
us weren&#39;t even specifically engaged to me! The contract was
made so it could be either me or my brother but since I&#39;m the
only one around...&quot; She let loose a frustrated groan. &quot;If we
got rid of Pop I know all this crap would go away.&quot; Sighing
the blonde commented, &quot;I would do it but I know Mother
would be angry with me. I guess we better find out what this
engagement is all about since we&#39;re gonna be hanging around
here to follow leads. Maybe I&#39;ll even get lucky and they&#39;ll let
me take a hot bath.&quot;
	Smiling in deep affection the gymnast shook her raven
head and said, &quot;It always leads back to your desire for hot
water doesn&#39;t it dearest?&quot;
	&quot;Of course,&quot; said the blonde. She hefted the flying pig
over her shoulder as they walked at an easy pace. &quot;This form
has its own advantages but I&#39;d rather be my normal boring old
self, y&#39;know?&quot;
	&quot;I would hardly call your true nature boring,&quot; purred
the gymnast as she bumped shoulders with the blonde. &quot;But
do not fret. Soon as we reach the Tendo residence hot water
shall flow in abundance and you shall be returned to normal.&quot;
	&quot;But first...&quot; the blonde trailed off slowly. &quot;We gotta
get rid of some extra baggage.&quot;
	Saying this the blonde girl bounded into the air with
an agility that didn&#39;t seem entirely human and left before
anyone watching could even blink. Her companion stared at
the empty space where the blonde had been then gave a
bemused sigh before moving into a quick run towards the
direction of the Tendo dojo.
	And in doing this they left the several hundred
shocked Nerima citizens behind. Citizens who were all
experiencing simultaneous queasy feelings in their stomachs.
	Things were definitely about to get stranger in their
small district. That much was for sure.

-One-

	Tendo Kasumi walked out of the sitting room that
was filled to the rim with her Father&#39;s wails. He was loudly
declaring his disappointment about their protesting the
engagement that he had arranged for them. As his wailing
grew louder Kasumi headed outside and towards the sound of
knocking that had caused her to leave the sitting room.
	More than anything Kasumi disliked her Father&#39;s habit
of throwing highly emotional fits. Often it felt like a form of
blackmail to her. A simple ploy that he would use against
them to get what he wanted. Sighing at this thought Kasumi
paused at the front doors to the dojo and was about to ask
who was there when a cheerful voice interrupted her.
	&quot;Hi!&quot; the voice called out.
	Blinking Kasumi lifted her dark brown head and
stared with wide eyes at the figure of a gorgeous blonde girl
standing on the high wall that surrounded the dojo. The
blonde held the hand of another girl with raven hair who was
floating beside the blonde wearing an equally cheery face.
	&quot;Is this the Tendo dojo?&quot; asked the blonde girl.
	&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; replied Kasumi as she tried to figure out
why the two girls were standing on the dojo wall.
	The blonde hooted loudly then said, &quot;Yes! It&#39;s hot
bath time for me!&quot;
	 The dark haired girl shook her head at this then
turned her attention to Kasumi and said, &quot;Might we be able to
converse with the head of your household? We have
information of some interest to your family and would like to
share it with you all as expediently as possible.&quot;
	&quot;Of course,&quot; said Kasumi. She shifted back into her
polite mode and smiled then said, &quot;Won&#39;t you please follow
me? I&#39;ll take you to my father right away. He&#39;s the one that
you&#39;ll want to see.&quot;
	&quot;We thank you humbly,&quot; said the dark haired girl as
she gave a formal bow.
	Her blonde companion was still talking rapidly to
herself about taking a hot bath and was only snapped out of
this state after the dark haired girl gave her a poke in the side.
	&quot;Huh?&quot; asked the blonde.
	&quot;Pay attention darling,&quot; said the dark haired girl in a
soft reprimand. &quot;I&#39;ve been able to gain a request to see the
one who will be able to answer our inquiries. And you know
what that will mean.&quot;
	Immediately the blonde&#39;s cobalt eyes gleamed in
anticipation and the two girls leapt down to the ground to
join Kasumi. Upon their landing the eldest Tendo sister was
stunned at the sheer height of the blonde who had to be
nearly six feet tall. There was also the added fact of the cute
pointed tips that her ears had.
	The dark haired girl noticed Kasumi&#39;s interest and
gave her a soft smile then prompted, &quot;Shall we be off?&quot;
	&quot;Oh my!&quot; said Kasumi suddenly, a bit embarrassed at
her daydreaming caused by the blonde&#39;s appearance. &quot;I&#39;m so
sorry. Please follow me.&quot;
	And with that Kasumi made her way back inside of
the house while wondering about the nature of these two very
strange girls that were visiting them. They couldn&#39;t possibly
have anything to do with her Father&#39;s recent announcement.
	Or could they?

	&quot;Father,&quot; called Kasumi as she entered the sitting
room. &quot;We have visitors.&quot;
	&quot;Visitors?&quot; questioned Tendo Soun eagerly as he leapt
to his feet. &quot;Is it my old friend Saotome?&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; said Kasumi with a smile while she
thought to herself that it was unlikely that either of these two
girls were her Father&#39;s old training partner. &quot;You&#39;ll have to
ask them yourself.&quot;
	&quot;Them?&quot; asked Soun as the figures of two girls
rounded the corner and met his gaze. &quot;Who...?&quot; Soun trailed
off as he gaped at them. &quot;Are you?&quot;
	&quot;I am Kuno Kodachi,&quot; said the dark haired girl. She
paused then added lavishly, &quot;The black rose.&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m Saotome Ranma,&quot; said the blonde as she looked
around distractedly. Her cobalt eyes narrowed and she
demanded, &quot;You guys got hot water right?&quot;
	&quot;Saotome...?&quot; began Soun in a daze.
	&quot;Ranma?&quot; finished his daughters together.
	And a second later the figure of Tendo Soun fell to
the floor in a heap as an echoing silence filled the air. His
daughters stared at their father in shock while Ranma looked
wary at this reaction. It was a feeling that Kodachi shared as
she sighed and said, &quot;Subtly has never been an option for you
has it Ranma darling?&quot;
	&quot;Not really,&quot; replied Ranma dryly. She shifted her
attention to the still shocked Tendos and muttered, &quot;But it
ain&#39;t like they&#39;re doing any better.&quot;

	&quot;Daddy,&quot; said Nabiki in exasperation. &quot;I thought you
said that Ranma was a boy. She doesn&#39;t look much like a boy
to me.&quot; After saying this she rested a curious hazel gaze on
the form of the blonde girl who was peering up at the ceiling
with some interest.
	&quot;But Saotome&#39;s postcard said that he had one of his
sons with him,&quot; Soun blubbered from under the covers that
Kasumi had tucked him into. Pulling the blanket up over his
head he moaned loudly then said in muffled tones, &quot;Our
promise to join Anything Goes schools of martial arts will
never be fulfilled now!&quot;
	&quot;Joining the Anything Goes schools?&quot; questioned
Kodachi as she moved forward. &quot;Excuse me Tendo-san but
what exactly does our dearest Ranma have to do with such
matters? Explanations as to this situation are why we have
arrived so rudely at your premises. If you might inform us as
to the circumstances surrounding this promise we shall swiftly
leave your company never to bother you again.&quot;
	Sniffing as he continued to sob quietly Soun said, &quot;We
made a promise, Saotome and I, to the Master that we would
continue the Anything Goes school of martial arts. Only two
families practice the style in the world today and that&#39;s the
Tendos and the Saotomes. The Master thought that if we
engaged two of our children in marriage they would keep our
traditions alive along with merging the might of both their
skills in the martial arts. But now it will never happen because
Saotome lied about having sons!&quot; Immediately after saying
this Soun burst into tears as the group took this information
into consideration.
	Finally Akane broke the silence and said bluntly, &quot;I
think this is stupid.&quot; Everyone blinked at her harsh statement
and unruffled at their reactions Akane continued, &quot;Just
because Ranma is a girl is no reason to treat her this way
Dad. We should let them stay here.&quot;
	On hearing this, the new arrivals exchanged sly looks
that did not make their way past Nabiki who watched them
with careful hazel eyes. &quot;We thank you a thousand times
over,&quot; said Kodachi politely as she bowed lowly. Flashing
Akane a charming smile she produced a black rose out of thin
air and offered it to the other girl. &quot;Truly you are a person
possessing a wealth of kindness to share such rich dwellings
with beggars like us. Even if it is for only a night we meekly
accept your offer and give our endless thanks.&quot;
	Blushing Akane stammered, &quot;I-I... okay. It&#39;s okay.&quot;
Managing to spit this out Akane said in more assured tones,
&quot;We don&#39;t mind at all... but only a night? You can stay longer
if you want.&quot; She gave her Father a slight shake. &quot;Right
Dad?&quot; As a response Soun merely moaned again and Akane
beamed. &quot;See? He agreed. You can stay longer if you want.
Our dojo is your dojo.&quot;
	&quot;Truly you are an angel fallen to earth,&quot; said Kodachi
warmly with her violet eyes shining. &quot;But sadly we must
return to our usual troublesome quest that sustains our lives
for now. We merely wished to resolve matters with your
family while discovering the truth behind the whispered
rumors of an engagement involving Ranma darling.&quot; Kodachi
shifted her attention then poked Ranma in the ribs and the tall
blonde jumped a bit as she seemed to hover in the air. &quot;Isn&#39;t
this correct dearest?&quot;
	&quot;Huh?&quot; said Ranma she blinked before glancing from
Kodachi to Akane then back again. &quot;Yeah. That&#39;s right.&quot; She
paused a second then asked abruptly, &quot;Can I take a bath?&quot;
	&quot;What?&quot; asked Akane who was a bit shocked at this
sudden request.
	&quot;Did you ask to take a bath?&quot; Nabiki joined her sister
in surprise at Ranma&#39;s outburst.
	With a wince Ranma said slowly, &quot;Uhmm. Yeah. I
just feel really, really, really, dirty from traveling all day and
I&#39;d like to have a hot bath if it&#39;d be okay.&quot;
	Before Akane or Nabiki could reply Kasumi rose
smoothly to her feet and said, &quot;Of course you can have a hot
bath Ranma. Follow me won&#39;t you?&quot;
	At this Ranma leapt eagerly to her feet and trailed
after Kasumi. A silence filled the room and finally Nabiki
turned her attention to the dark haired girl who had been
controlling almost the entire conversation. Kodachi, that was
what she said her name was, that and something about some
type of black flower. Nabiki knew what Kodachi was the
second she started talking. She had met thousands of con
artists and some at her school would even venture to say that
Nabiki herself was one of them.
	No doubt about it, this Kodachi was a smooth
operator but what were she and her friend up to? And how
had they known about the engagement? It wasn&#39;t like any sort
of con job Nabiki had ever heard of. And she had heard of
plenty during her experience in the often harsh world of
competitive martial arts prize fighting tournaments. Maybe
they were planning to blackmail the family... or perhaps this
was just going to be an inside job for robbery. Either way
Nabiki wasn&#39;t about to let them out of her sight. Especially
the dark haired one called Kodachi whom she believed to be
the ringleader. While the blonde appeared to have a good
head on her shoulders she did not seem to have the clever wit
of her companion.
	Noting Nabiki&#39;s study the Kodachi raised an eyebrow
and questioned, &quot;Are there horns sticking out of my head or
do you simply not trust me?&quot;
	Blinking at this statement Nabiki could only stare
baffled at the other girl who tilted her head to one side in
expectation of an answer. Before Nabiki could comment
Akane cut in, &quot;Ignore Nabiki! She&#39;s not usually so suspicious
but we don&#39;t get a lot of strangers.&quot;
	&quot;Ah,&quot; said Kodachi in understanding as she graced
Nabiki with a speculative smile. &quot;I sympathize greatly. It must
be hard to allow those you who are unknown to you into
such a protected area of your life. If you wish we shall vacate
as earlier stated.&quot; As she said this Kodachi rose to her feet
and soon as she did this Akane followed.
	&quot;No, no! Don&#39;t do that!&quot; said Akane quickly as she
waved her hands. Pausing she formed a thoughtful expression
then said, &quot;Please don&#39;t go. We&#39;d really like for you to stay.
Besides, you haven&#39;t even seen our dojo yet.&quot;
	Halting in her slow stride Kodachi turned to look
back at Akane curiously. &quot;Dojo you say?&quot;

	 Sinking into the hot water of the bath Ranma sighed
in bliss as she felt the change shifting in her system as she
went back into her natural male state.
	Gazing down at his masculine body in definite
approval Ranma said, &quot;I gotta admit that having powers is
nice but sometimes I just need to be a guy. Too bad I have to
change back before I head down there.&quot; Releasing another
sigh he tilted back his jet black head to gaze pensively at the
ceiling. &quot;It&#39;s not even an option. I know that from the look
Dachi gave me. It&#39;d be too much trouble to stay here and sort
things out because of Pop. Plus it looks like Dachi&#39;s not in the
mood to deal with it and without her smooth talking...&quot;
	Ranma snorted, &quot;There&#39;s no way I&#39;d ever get out of
here alive. Looks like that Tendo guy is taking this promise of
theirs pretty serious. Kinda strange that Pop never mentioned
him or that Master of theirs before. I wonder if bro knows
about any of this? Last time I got a postcard from him he was
in Trinidad Tobago so who knows when he&#39;s gonna find us.
Well, this stupid engagement isn&#39;t my problem. I&#39;m just gonna
go along with the plan then split in the morning after we eat
some food and get some sleep. I got enough problems on my
hands without having to get rid of another iinazuke.&quot;
	Pausing in his rambling talk Ranma thought about the
dark haired gymnast who&#39;d been traveling with him for little
over a year and smiled. Without Kuno Kodachi his life would
definitely be a lot more complicated. A lot more complicated
and a lot less fun. She had to be the best friend he ever had
and sometimes when he gazed into her luminous violet eyes
Ranma found himself wishing that they were more than that.
So far they were moving at a pretty slow rate than most
couples did but he wanted to be careful and make sure that he
did everything right.
	There were very few things that Ranma felt bound by
honor about but treating Kodachi like a lady... well. That was
one of them. And besides that, he was fully content with the
scattered kisses they shared which could alternate from a
sweet tenderness to a burning passion. Ranma knew how
lucky he was to have found a girl who genuinely liked and
understood him but was also secure in their relationship. He
knew this and had decided to sustain his honor in this sole
area as he vowed to wait until Kodachi deemed it was time to
be fully intimate with her. This decision was also helped by
the fact that Ranma had met her older brother briefly when he
attended middle school and he knew exactly what Tatewaki
would do to him if he maltreated Kodachi.
	These feelings were why Ranma was stubbornly
opposed to any engagements they came upon. He didn&#39;t care
about any sort of promises his Father had made on his behalf.
In fact most the engagements weren&#39;t specific and could be
meant for Ranma or his brother. It just so happened that since
Ranma was the son that was present he was the one who got
saddled with the responsibility. But to Ranma who he married
should be his decision and as far as he was concerned his
mind was already made up.
	Kodachi was the only girl for him. He knew this and
so did she. This knowledge was instinctive and so strong was
their belief in their destined love that none of the many
admirers they had picked up in their three years of traveling
together ever had the slightest chance of destroying their
bond. This was because Kodachi knew Ranma inside and out,
just as he knew her, and that sort of connection simply cannot
be broken. Especially when the people sharing it have only
found acceptance in each other.
	In their meeting they encountered the first person in
their lives who did not scorn their natural indiscretions of
stealing food or conning people out of money for survival.
Rather they traded secrets and devised new and better plans
for doing so. In short, Ranma and Kodachi found in one
another their partner in crime. And they vowed to be partners
forever. Together they made a phenomenal team and Kodachi
had helped Ranma out of more tight jams then he&#39;d like to
recall. Jams which were all mostly caused by his bumbling
Father. Ranma grimaced as he thought of his Father, he was
more trouble than he was worth but he was a good teacher
and was admittedly a great martial artist. It was too bad he
had an irritating tendency of engaging his sons off to different
girls all for stupid things such as a free meal. Something that
they could easily scam for him.
	Of course, when his father had arranged all these
engagements Ranma was only a small child and Kodachi had
been nowhere in sight. Sighing as he thought about his
traveling companion Ranma wondered what would have
become of his life without Kodachi at his side. As far as
Ranma was concerned she was his personal definition of
feminine perfection.
	Once you disregarded that frightening laugh of hers of
course.

	&quot;Are you sure you wish to spar Nabiki?&quot; asked
Kodachi as she removed her silk Chinese style jacket and set
it aside gently. In doing so she revealed the tight violet top to
her gymnast&#39;s uniform which accented her impressive upper
body muscles.
	&quot;Oh I&#39;m sure,&quot; drawled Nabiki while flexing her
muscles and moving into a relaxed fighting position. Wearing
the traditional white gi of their dojo Nabiki very much
reflected the figure of a skillful fighter. &quot;This will be good for
me. I haven&#39;t had a hard workout in a long time. Besides, this
is just a friendly match. For fun.&quot; Forming a small dangerous
smile Nabiki said, &quot;Right Kodachi?&quot;
	&quot;As you wish,&quot; said Kodachi lowly. She had now
accepted Nabiki&#39;s challenge and was silently praying that the
girl was as good as she thought she was.
	Inspecting Kodachi&#39;s toned body Akane looked
anxiously to her older sister and said in exasperation, &quot;Nabiki!
Why do you always have to be so violent? You know this is
why all the boys think you&#39;re so strange! And Kodachi is a
guest, you shouldn&#39;t be fighting with her. Even if it is for fun.&quot;
	&quot;Akane,&quot; Nabiki said slowly as she cracked her
knuckles. &quot;As the next in line for the Tendo dojo I&#39;m
supposed to give and receive challenges in order to improve
my skills as a martial artist. Maybe if you weren&#39;t so occupied
with the fair play attitude of all the sports you play you&#39;d
remember the code of a true fighter.&quot;
	Forming a slightly wounded expression Akane folded
her arms across her chest and sniffed as she said, &quot;Fine. Go
ahead and fight Kodachi for no reason.&quot;
	&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Nabiki sardonically as hazel eyes
focused clinically on Kodachi. &quot;I will.&quot; Narrowing her gaze
she questioned, &quot;You ready?&quot;
	Giving a short nod Kodachi replied, &quot;Always.&quot;
	Kodachi studied Nabiki and wondered if she should
implement any of her weapons in the battle. Certainly it
would only add to her current problem but it might be
necessary if Nabiki&#39;s skills proved higher than she estimated.
The problem being if she and Ranma wanted to stay in the
dojo for the night, then leave in the morning as planned, they
would have to stay in the Tendos good graces. And staying in
their good graces did not include Kodachi beating up the
arrogant middle daughter of the household. Frowning slightly
Kodachi reluctantly moved into fighting position.
	Nabiki gave a sudden leap at Kodachi with an
unexpected speed. The gymnast dodged the attack with
expert ease before she jumped backwards to put some space
between them. The girl was fast but Kodachi saw that she
was entirely too rash in her attacks. If she didn&#39;t make sure to
restrain herself she knew that she could hurt Nabiki in battle.
On her landing Kodachi saw that Nabiki was once again in a
crouched position. Her mannerisms caused Kodachi to note
the similarity the middle Tendo sister had to that of a wild
cat. In another swift movement Nabiki flew at Kodachi, this
time her hands flashing with incredible speed as she aimed a
series of punches at Kodachi. Ducking each would be blow
Kodachi bent herself into a huddled position. She was about
to move into a backflip when without warning a pig flew into
the dojo and launched itself at her. In an instant Kodachi
grabbed Nabiki in a tight embrace and bounded to one side
causing the flying pig to crash into the dojo wall.
	Stunned from the entrance of the flying pig and being
grabbed by Kodachi it took a minute for Nabiki to regain her
faculties. When she did she instantly noticed the warmth from
being held in Kodachi&#39;s arms and cried, &quot;Let me go!&quot;
	Raising a dark eyebrow in speculation Kodachi asked,
&quot;Why are you so angry? I was only trying to protect you.&quot;
	&quot;Protect me?!&quot; repeated Nabiki incredulously as she
stepped further away from the gymnast. &quot;From what?!&quot;
	&quot;From that,&quot; said Kodachi calmly. The gymnast then
pointed at the flying pig which was groggily waking up as it
made some pathetic sounding squeals.
	&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Nabiki scoffed. &quot;It looks real dangerous.
That&#39;s just a flying pig!&quot; She was about to say more when she
stopped to consider her words. &quot;A flying pig...&quot; Nabiki trailed
off dumbly as she blinked and moved her gaze to stare at the
animal. &quot;I don&#39;t believe it.&quot;
	&quot;Believe it,&quot; said Kodachi with a sniff. &quot;This creature
has been bothering us from some time. I think it&#39;s some sort
of mutant grown in a lab. We would have it destroyed but
Ranma has far too kind a heart.&quot;
	&quot;This thing just follows you around?&quot; asked Nabiki
skeptically as she studied the flying pig.
	&quot;Constantly,&quot; said Kodachi. She knelt down to tie up
the flying pig with her ribbon and said, &quot;The pig is quite the
nuisance. But this is the last time we&#39;ll be dealing with it. I
plan on selling it to a butcher.&quot;
	A mere second after she said this, the flying pig let
loose a horrifying squeal and squirmed out of Kodachi&#39;s
grasp. Wriggling out of the ribbon that it was tied up with the
flying pig stood up on all fours and began to angrily hiss at
Kodachi who smirked.
	&quot;So,&quot; Kodachi drawled. &quot;You live.&quot;
	For a response the flying pig squealed loudly then
launched itself into the air and flew at Kodachi with amazing
speed. Kicking its fat legs the pig began a fierce dive bomb
attack as it assaulted Kodachi who was dodging as she tried
to wrap her ribbon around the pig again.
	While she tried to capture the pig Kodachi laughed
her echoing high pitched laugh and said, &quot;You cannot beat me
you stupid pig. Surely you don&#39;t presume that the black rose
would be easily defeated?&quot; Violet eyes gleamed dangerously
as she said, &quot;You shall surely pay for such a folly. I will never
allow you to proceed with yet another scheme to unhappily
trap Ranma&#39;s affections!&quot;
	Watching this Nabiki blinked before she turned to
Akane who had been observing this odd scene with some
shock. &quot;Akane!&quot; shouted Nabiki. &quot;Go get Ranma! Maybe she
knows what this is all about!&quot;
	Blinking Akane nodded her head rapidly before
dashing out of the dojo leaving Nabiki to observe the battle
between Kodachi and the flying pig. Watching this peculiar
scene Nabiki said to herself, &quot;A flying pig. Why is there a
flying pig? And why is a flying pig in our dojo? And why in
the world is a flying pig attacking her?&quot;
	Considering all of these questions Nabiki hoped that
she would get lucky and Ranma might be able to explain the
abnormality of a flying pig showing up in their dojo.
	Shaking these thoughts out of her head the heir to the
Tendo dojo jumped into the fray to help Kodachi in fighting
the out of control flying pig. Even if Nabiki didn&#39;t trust the
gymnast she wasn&#39;t about to let her be attacked by some
weird mutant animal.


        Dashing up the stairs at a harried pace Akane ran towards the
furo then flung the door open and said, &quot;Ranma! You&#39;ve got
to come quick! A flying pig is in our dojo attacking Kodachi
and don&#39;t ask me what a flying...&quot;
	Akane trailed off dumbly as she gazed at not the
figure of the statuesque blonde girl from before but rather at a
rakishly handsome young man with jet black hair who was
gazing at her in certain panic. The boy started stammering a
series of explanations, none of which accessed in Akane&#39;s
mind, as he hastily rose to his feet to reveal all of his muscular
and rather abundant assets. Immediately on seeing this Akane
blushed deeply as she tore her light brown eyes away from
where they had been previously focused. Noticing the change
in her facial color and direction of her former gaze the boy
yelped then dove back into the water while still babbling
rapidly at her. Backing out of the furo slowly Akane shut the
doors to it then stared at them for a long moment then said in
puzzlement, &quot;Who was that?&quot;

	Meanwhile back in the dojo Nabiki had ceased in her
attacks as the flying pig had finally been defeated. She was
instead observing with wide hazel eyes as Kodachi jumped up
and down on the already unconscious flying pig in certain
glee. The jumping seemed systematic as Kodachi paused to
consider her options before she made her next leap. It was
almost as if Kodachi was planning where her next jump
would be in accordance to how much damage it would do to
the passed out animal.
	&quot;Kodachi?&quot; said Nabiki in uncertain tones. &quot;I think
you can stop.&quot;
	Halting in her work Kodachi gave Nabiki a warm
smile then stepped off of the flying pig. &quot;Certainly you&#39;re
correct,&quot; said Kodachi smoothly as she walked towards the
other girl. &quot;I was merely taking precautions to ensure that he
would no longer be able to menace us further. The animal
suffers from what would could be called a psychosomatic
complex and appears to have a vendetta against us. Ranma
and I believe that it had been the subject of laboratory
experiments which caused its winged state. It has been
pursuing us for many leagues and no matter how many times
we defeat the shoddy creature and ship it off to laboratories it
always returns to attack us. It&#39;s quite the puzzle you see.&quot;
	Listening to this with a face of obvious skepticism
Nabiki said drolly, &quot;Right. Tell me another one.&quot; Placing her
hands on her hips Nabiki continued, &quot;I&#39;m not buying it and if I
were you I&#39;d start telling the truth. Especially since it looks
like your flying friend is starting to wake up.&quot;
	Violet eyes shifted from a look of silent respect to
certain panic as she whirled around but the pig was too fast
for her and it charged into the air to deliver a crushing blow
to Kodachi&#39;s midsection with it&#39;s head. With a loud thud the
gymnast hit the far wall of the dojo as the flying pig turned its
attention to Nabiki.
	Shifting into a fighting position Nabiki said, &quot;You&#39;re
not taking me out that easily Mister Pig...&quot;
	Nabiki paused in her speech as she watched the flying
pig narrow its eyes as it hovered in the air. It was almost as if
the creature was studying her.
	&quot;Interfering pig,&quot; groaned Kodachi as she pushed
herself up into a sitting position. Clutching her sore ribs she
said, &quot;Have you not attempted to ruin Ranma dearest&#39;s life
enough without this instance added to the list?&quot;
	Seeming agitated at this the flying pig whirled around
to hover over Kodachi as it released a series of angry squeals.
	&quot;Fool,&quot; said Kodachi as she rose slowly to her feet
while gripping the dojo wall. &quot;No one can understand you
when you&#39;re like this. You do realize that all I need to do is
knock you out again and this will be over with.&quot;
	&quot;Excuse me?&quot; said Nabiki as she interrupted Kodachi
who bore her violet gaze into the other girl. &quot;But why are you
having a conversation with this pig? It&#39;s just an animal.&quot;
	Before Kodachi could reply the flying pig released
another angry squeal and went zooming out of the dojo with
a burst of unexpected speed.
	&quot;Shimatta,&quot; Kodachi hissed as she pushed past Nabiki
to run out of the dojo. &quot;He&#39;s going after the hot water.&quot;
	&quot;Hot water?&quot; said Nabiki. Following after the gymnast
she wondered about it being mentioned in such emphasized
tones by both Ranma and now Kodachi.

	Running into the sitting room Nabiki and Kodachi
were greeted with the sight of Akane muttering to herself
while pacing back and forth. Soun seemed unaware of this
situation and continued to moan beneath the covers.
	Suddenly, there was a crash from the kitchen and they
heard Kasumi exclaim, &quot;Oh my!&quot;
	Akane paused in her pacing to stare with wide eyes as
the flying pig zoomed into the sitting room holding a kettle of
hot water in its teeth. Blinking at the flying pig that was
hovering right in front of her Akane said, &quot;This is getting
weirder and weirder. First it&#39;s a flying pig in the dojo and then
it&#39;s some guy in the furo. I knew I shouldn&#39;t have started
taking Coach&#39;s new iron supplement pills. They&#39;re messing
with my brain. I&#39;m hallucinating.&quot;
	Ignoring the usual introspective mumblings of her
younger sister Nabiki turned her attention to Kodachi and
said, &quot;What&#39;s this all about? I know there has to be a good
reason why there&#39;s a flying pig in our house.&quot;
	Ignoring Nabiki&#39;s question Kodachi moved closer to
the flying pig which seemed to hiss at her as Kasumi entered
the room. &quot;Oh dear,&quot; said Kasumi quietly. &quot;So it wasn&#39;t a
dream. A flying pig did steal our teakettle.&quot;
	Peeking his head out from under the covers Soun
asked, &quot;Did someone say a flying pig?&quot;
	&quot;Yes Daddy,&quot; said Nabiki with a sigh as she stared at
the flying pig who was glaring at Kodachi. &quot;There&#39;s a flying
pig in our house and don&#39;t ask me how it got here because I
have no idea.&quot; Nabiki then turned her attention to Akane and
said, &quot;Now what&#39;s this about a guy in the furo?
	&quot;Well,&quot; said Akane thoughtfully. &quot;I might&#39;ve been
imagining it but when I went to the furo to get Ranma there
was this guy in there instead. And don&#39;t ask me how he got in
there. All I know is that he definitely isn&#39;t one of my old
boyfriends. They&#39;re not that big.&quot;
	&quot;A guy?&quot; questioned Kodachi as she ceased her
glaring at the flying pig. Stepping forward she said, &quot;Do you
know where this intruder is currently?&quot;
	&quot;No,&quot; said Akane with some confusion as she noted
Kodachi&#39;s anxious expression. &quot;He seemed embarrassed that I
accidentally busted in on him so I got out of there pretty
quick. Then again, I don&#39;t know how he got in there in the
first place.&quot; She looked to Nabiki and questioned, &quot;You aren&#39;t
renting out the furo for money are you?&quot;
	&quot;Please,&quot; drawled Nabiki. &quot;Like I really would resort
to that. I much rather stick to my betting pool business.&quot;
	Kodachi continued to look distressed until the sound
of deep masculine voice met their ears and said, &quot;Don&#39;t be
like that Dachi. I&#39;d never run out of here without you. We&#39;re
partners remember?&quot;
	Instantly all eyes turned to the figure of a handsome
boy with jet black hair pulled back into a pigtail. He wore the
same Chinese style clothing as the statuesque blonde who had
first appeared with Kodachi. Bounding forward Kodachi
enveloped the boy in a tight hug, who returned it wearing a
soft smile, she then pulled away and said, &quot;I am ever so sorry
Ranma darling. Your pig of a father has somehow found his
way from the location in which you discarded him in and to
this abode. It appears that we will once again have a great
deal of explaining to do.&quot;
	&quot;Ranma?&quot; said all the Tendos at once.
	&quot;You mean...&quot; said Nabiki slowly.
	&quot;It&#39;s the furo guy!&quot; said Akane happily.
	&quot;Thank the Kami,&quot; said Soun crying.
	&quot;Oh my,&quot; said Kasumi softly.
	Observing all of these reactions at once the pigtailed
boy grimaced and met the eyes of Kodachi who shrugged as
way of an answer. Sighing at this, he said reluctantly, &quot;I&#39;m
Saotome Ranma.&quot;

	&quot;You&#39;re the same girl we saw before?&quot; asked Nabiki
as she studied the handsome dark haired boy who was sitting
across from her at the table. The boy had Kodachi sitting at
his one side and the flying pig at the other. The flying pig
looked almost smug as it closely guarded the teakettle that it
had stolen earlier.
	&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Ranma with a touch of boredom. &quot;It was
me all right. Just like this fat pig is the guy your father knows
as Saotome Genma.&quot;
	&quot;Genma?&quot; said Soun with some shock as he studied
the flying pig. &quot;That&#39;s you? How...?&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s quite simple,&quot; said Kodachi.
	The gymnast swiftly grabbed the kettle that sat in
front of the flying pig, who squealed at her, then poured the
contents of the kettle onto the animal&#39;s head. The Tendos all
watched as the pig changed into the figure of a husky man
wearing a white gi and a strange turban of sorts on his head.
	&quot;Genma!&quot; cried Soun as he moved forward. &quot;It is you
old friend! What&#39;s the meaning behind all this?&quot;
	Before Genma could reply Kodachi cut in smoothly,
&quot;All shall be explained quite easily if you simply stop shouting
and listen to me closely.&quot; Kodachi gave calming smile which
seemed to pacify all the Tendos. Observing this, Kodachi
continued, &quot;Nearly two months ago we three journeyed to
China on a quest. Upon arriving there we spoke little of the
language and only after several business dealings Ranma and I
made were we able to obtain a Guide of sorts. We requested
to gain some training skills native to the region and the Guide
led us to the accursed training grounds of Jusenkyo wherein
lies the pools of sorrow.&quot;
	Kodachi formed a wry expression and said, &quot;I myself
halted at the training provided on the unusual bamboo poles
resting over the various springs. This was due to my wariness
at the given name of the training grounds. I am sad to say that
this did not affect Ranma darling in such a manner and he
agreed to spar with his father atop the poles. In battle he did
triumph, knocking this fool into the nearest spring, which
happened to be the spring of drowned big fat flying pig.&quot;
	After this was said there was a long pause before
Soun snickered and said, &quot;So he fell into the spring of
drowned big fat flying pig?&quot;
	&quot;Precisely,&quot; said Kodachi with a smirk. &quot;It fits him
very well, does it not?&quot;
	&quot;Too well!&quot; Soun exclaimed as he burst out into full
on laughter while his daughters joined in.
	&quot;Tendo!&quot; said Genma in horror. &quot;How could you
laugh at my pain?! This is a horrible curse!&quot;
	At this comment the Tendos laughter grew louder as
they toppled over in a group. Ranma and Kodachi exchanged
a knowing smirk as Genma silently seethed.
	&quot;Calm down Pop,&quot; said Ranma casually. &quot;You should
be used to this by now. Everyone has the same reaction when
they find out about your curse.&quot;
	&quot;I know,&quot; muttered Genma with a scowl. &quot;But I still
don&#39;t think it&#39;s funny. It&#39;s my greatest mistake...&quot;
	&quot;And with you that&#39;s saying a lot,&quot; said Kodachi slyly.
	&quot;Why you--&quot; began Genma irately.
	Wiping his tears away Soun managed to stop laughing
as he said, &quot;Don&#39;t be so upset, Saotome! We can&#39;t help it if
your curse is so ridiculous. After all, wasn&#39;t it your decision
to go to the cursed training grounds of Jusenkyo?&quot;
	&quot;Exactly,&quot; said Kodachi as she gave a nod. &quot;And it
was also him who managed to surprise Ranma in his newly
cursed form and caused his son to fall into the spring of
drowned female elf. Sadly this occurred so swiftly that I did
not have time to save Ranma.&quot;
	Stopping in her speech Kodachi suddenly perched on
her toes and produced her violet ribbon then wrapped it
around Genma&#39;s midsection. In a swift action she yanked the
ribbon and sent Genma flying backwards and into the koi
pond she had seen while walking from the dojo to the sitting
room. Seconds later the soggy form of an irritated pig was
seen as it flew out of the pond and back into the sitting room.
	Turning back to the Tendos who wore shocked
expressions Kodachi said, &quot;Cold water is what turns them
into their accursed states, while hot water brings their natural
forms back into being.&quot;
	While she said this Genma pig knocked the teakettle
over so the last of the hot water changed him back into his
human form. He shot Kodachi a dirty look and said
indignantly, &quot;What was that for?&quot; He then shifted his gaze to
Ranma. &quot;And you! My own son! Why didn&#39;t you stop her?&quot;
	Snorting Ranma replied, &quot;Maybe because you
deserved it for getting me stuck in another engagement. I ain&#39;t
going along with this Pop. You ought to know that by now.
There&#39;s no way you&#39;re forcing me to marry a complete
stranger. I said no to this sort of stunt all those times before
and I&#39;m gonna say no again.&quot;
	&quot;All those times before?&quot; repeated Nabiki. &quot;You mean
that he&#39;s done this type of thing more than once?&quot;
	&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; began Ranma eagerly as he leaned across
the table. &quot;At least a billion--&quot;
	&quot;You&#39;re exaggerating again!&quot; shouted Genma. He
paused to solemnly push his wire rim glasses up the bridge of
his nose. &quot;I&#39;ve only made five engagements for my boys. That
also includes Tendo here.&quot; He glared at Ranma then added,
&quot;And you&#39;ve only met three of your iinazukes, not a billion.
I&#39;d say that you&#39;re confusing the large amount of girls chasing
after you with the number that I&#39;ve engaged you to.&quot;
	Ranma snarled at this and looked ready to attack
Genma when Kodachi intervened. &quot;Now, now, dearest,&quot; she
said in soothing tones. &quot;This is hardly the time for such
things.&quot; Her violet eyes turned to the elder Saotome and
Kodachi asked, &quot;If the Tendos are the fourth iinazuke for us
to encounter then who is the fifth?&quot;
	Snorting Genma folded his arms across his chest and
said, &quot;That&#39;s none of Ranma&#39;s concern. His brother is the one
responsible for that engagement.&quot;
	&quot;Who cares about all that,&quot; said Akane in dismissive
tones as she looked to Ranma. &quot;Cold water really changes
you into a girl elf?&quot;
	&quot;Yup,&quot; Ranma said with a smile. &quot;It was hard to
believe at first. But apparently a lot of those magical
creatures in the faerie tales really existed at some point. I
even sort of like changing into my cursed form now. It&#39;s
pretty useful for avoiding folks who know me as a guy. And
changing ain&#39;t really that big a deal to me anymore, especially
since Dachi and me always carry a flask of hot water on us
for emergencies.&quot;
	&quot;Saotome!&quot; roared Soun suddenly as he interrupted
this conversation. The large form of a demon head hovered
over them and it shouted, &quot;How dare you go back on our
promise and engage your sons to other girls?! What of the
Master?! You know what will become of us if we do not
fulfill our promise to him!&quot;
	&quot;But Tendo!&quot; exclaimed Genma as he cowered
slightly. &quot;It isn&#39;t my fault, I needed food and like the boy said
before, none of the engagements were valid! We can still
fulfill our promise to the Master. My son is a boy despite the
nature of his curse and he can still marry one of your
daughters. The promise can be kept after all!&quot;
	Thinking about this Soun slowly went back to his
normal state and broke into a wide smile then said, &quot;You&#39;re
perfectly right Saotome! There&#39;s no reason why we can&#39;t go
ahead as planned!&quot; Walking towards Ranma he slapped the
pigtailed boy on the shoulder then said, &quot;Well? How about it?
These are my daughters, Akane, who&#39;s sixteen; Nabiki, who&#39;s
seventeen; and Kasumi, who&#39;s nineteen. Pick anyone you like
and they&#39;ll be your new iinazuke.&quot;
	&quot;No,&quot; said Ranma as he looked up at Soun. &quot;I&#39;m not
getting engaged to anyone. I don&#39;t want a iinazuke.&quot;
	Soun turned red faced at this and started to say
something when Akane groaned at said, &quot;Dad. This is silly!
We&#39;ve already said that this engagement idea of yours was
ridiculous. Do you seriously think that we&#39;d go along with
it?&quot; Light brown eyes focused on Ranma and she said, &quot;No
offense but none of us really like being put in this arranged
engagement with you. It&#39;s just not right, even though you
seem like a nice enough guy.&quot;
	&quot;Don&#39;t you mean that it&#39;s not right that you would
have to give up your legions of fans, Akane?&quot; said Nabiki
with a smirk. &quot;If you got engaged to Ranma there would be
no more nonstop dating for you.&quot;
	Looking flustered Akane retorted, &quot;I don&#39;t date that
much Nabiki! And besides, this engagement is a stupid idea.
You even said so yourself.&quot;
	&quot;Hey,&quot; said Ranma as he interposed between the
feuding sisters. &quot;I&#39;m in complete agreement here. And there&#39;s
no reason to tease your sister about dating Nabiki. A cute girl
like her should have lots of dates. It&#39;s natural.&quot;
	Smiling in triumph Akane stuck her tongue out at
Nabiki who rolled her hazel eyes. Observing this Kodachi
sighed quietly then said, &quot;Shall we try to discuss this possible
engagement in a civilized manner? If we do I&#39;m sure that we&#39;ll
be able to reach an agreement that suits all of our different
needs and opinions.&quot; Turning to Ranma she smiled and said,
&quot;You speak first my dearest.&quot;
	&quot;Okay,&quot; said Ranma as his handsome face turned
contemplative. Scratching his cheek he said, &quot;Mainly what I&#39;m
against is being forced to marry someone. And more than that
it&#39;s the fact that I don&#39;t know any of you girls. I mean... you
all seem nice but there ain&#39;t no way that I&#39;d seriously consider
marrying a complete stranger. That&#39;s pretty much all I have to
say about that. Oh yeah... and there&#39;s also the fact that this
engagement somehow seems more legit than the others. I
dunno why. Maybe because Tendo-san here used to train
with Pop but I never heard of any Master.&quot;
	Soun and Genma exchanged nervous glances at this
then Genma said, &quot;That&#39;s for the best my boy. The Master is
not someone to be trifled with and as for why you have never
seen him... his current location is... unknown.&quot;
	&quot;That will do,&quot; said Kodachi coolly as she shifted her
gaze to the Tendo sisters. &quot;And what of the sisters three? It
would be appreciated to hear your opinions on the matter of
this expected engagement.&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s dumb,&quot; said Akane with a shrug. &quot;I said it once
and I&#39;ll say it again. Ranma seems like a nice guy but I don&#39;t
want to marry him.&quot;
	&quot;An apt answer,&quot; said Kodachi in satisfaction. Turning
to Kasumi she said, &quot;What are your feelings on this offered
prospect of marriage?&quot;
	&quot;Oh my,&quot; said Kasumi, it was not often that she was
asked her thoughts on matters. &quot;While I do find him very
handsome I&#39;m afraid I must agree with Ranma about the idea
of marrying a complete stranger. It just isn&#39;t proper.&quot;
	Nodding sagely at this Kodachi turned lastly to Nabiki
then said dryly, &quot;And you?&quot;
	&quot;Ditto,&quot; said Nabiki with a shrug. &quot;Kasumi pretty
much said it all for me. I have to admit I think this Ranma of
yours is pretty attractive but I don&#39;t much like the idea of
having to marry anyone.&quot;
	&quot;Then we all are in agreement,&quot; said Kodachi smiling.
&quot;There shall be no engagement. Wonderful!&quot; Rising to her
feet she looked at Ranma then said, &quot;Lets be off Ranma
dearest. There is no need to stay further.&quot;
	&quot;Fine with me,&quot; said Ranma as he stood beside
Kodachi. &quot;I got better things to do than hang around here.&quot;
	&quot;NO!!&quot; shouted Soun and Genma together. The two
men then exchanged surprised glances. Genma was the first
to speak after this and said, &quot;You can&#39;t leave boy. This isn&#39;t
like all the others. We made a solemn oath. A promise to our
Master. It isn&#39;t something to be taken lightly... this... this is on
my honor boy. And when have you ever known me to make a
promise on my honor?&quot;
	Blinking Ranma froze at this statement and the room
was silent all except for the sound of Soun&#39;s sobbing. &quot;He&#39;s
right,&quot; said Ranma as he looked to Kodachi. &quot;Pop has never
promised anything on his honor before. I always figured that
was because he didn&#39;t have any but...&quot;
	Seeing Ranma&#39;s reluctance to leave and sensing
perhaps something deeper to this engagement as well
Kodachi sighed then said, &quot;Saotome-san. Tell us why this
engagement is of such importance and perhaps we shall
consider an alternative to dismissing it completely.&quot;
	&quot;The Master,&quot; said Genma heavily with utmost
solemnity. &quot;Is the most evil martial artist in the known world
and if he discovered that we did not set two of our children in
an engagement as he wished... I shudder to think of what
would become of us all. And despite his sinister ways his wish
is not an impossible or slighted one. He merely wanted our
two styles of the Anything Goes school to merge into one. A
reasonable request if you think about it.&quot;
	Considering this Kodachi turned to Ranma who
looked thoughtful and said, &quot;Well?&quot;
	&quot;I dunno,&quot; said Ranma as he rubbed his jaw. Cobalt
eyes met violet ones and he asked lowly, &quot;Seems legit. But
what do you think Dachi?&quot;
	Leaning forward to whisper in his ear Kodachi said, &quot;I
feel it rings of some truth Ranma darling. Perhaps we might
reach a stalemate of sorts until we may investigate things
further. We were planning to reside in this area as we
continued the search. Added to that fact there is the truth that
this is an ample dwelling in which to live and the Tendos will
happily supply us with free food and board.&quot;
	Smiling at this last statement Ranma replied, &quot;You
always got the big picture in mind. Lets do it.&quot;
	Pulling away from Ranma the dark haired gymnast
coughed then said, &quot;Ranma dearest has decided that he will
not immediately rescind the promise of his father and
Tendo-san but before he shall even consider marrying anyone
he must first know them better. Therefore we would like to
ask permission to live in this dwelling so to better know the
prospective iinazukes. Perhaps in doing so a mutual romantic
relationship shall come to pass but no vows as to this nature
are to be made. It is not yet secured and if a romance to seal
the engagement does not arise we shall depart. Agreed?&quot;
	&quot;Agreed! Agreed!!&quot; shouted Soun. He immediately
snapped out of his sobbing state and leapt towards Kodachi
then began shaking her hand rapidly.
	After this was said Akane gave Ranma and Kodachi
short welcoming hugs and offered to let Kodachi stay in her
room before she went upstairs to do her regimen of sit-ups.
Kasumi in the meanwhile was heading towards the kitchen to
retrieve the requested sake for her father and Genma as she
wore a thoughtful expression on her face. And Nabiki simply
directed her sharp hazel gaze at Kodachi and Ranma who
were murmuring to each other in low tones.
	Nabiki knew she was going to have to keep a close
eye on the pair because they definitely had an ulterior motive
for going along with her father&#39;s plans. That much was clear.

	Strolling out onto the verandah Nabiki stood next to
Akane who was observing the figures of Ranma, who was in
his cursed form, and Kodachi beating the unconscious figure
of Genma pig into the ground. They watched this go on for
several minutes before Akane said, &quot;They have some serious
rage control problems.&quot;
	&quot;What did he do to deserve all this?&quot; asked Nabiki as
she watched Genma pig somehow revive and fly into the air
to start dive bombing Ranma.
	&quot;I&#39;m not really sure,&quot; said Akane in amazement. She
was gaping at Kodachi who had wrapped her ribbon around
Genma pig and slammed him into the high wall surrounding
the dojo. &quot;I heard Mister Saotome say something about
wanting his share of the latest job or something like that.
Then Kodachi gave this really eerie laugh that freaked out
Ranma and the next thing I know they&#39;re both beating up
Saotome-san.&quot; Pausing Akane scratched the back of her short
head of hair and murmured, &quot;This is more painful to watch
then us stomping St. Hebereke into the ground during last
year&#39;s quarter finals in basketball.&quot;
	Rolling her eyes Nabiki drawled, &quot;You don&#39;t need to
remind me Imotochan. I know that the new season is coming
up. And have no fear... bets are ready on exactly how many
jump shots you&#39;ll score in the first quarter.&quot;
	&quot;Well,&quot; began Akane thoughtfully while she headed
into the sitting room to eat the food that Kasumi was bringing
in. &quot;Make sure that you place it somewhere in the double
digits. I plan to be voted MVP for the second year in a row.&quot;
	&quot;You do that and your precious fan club of rhyming
airheads will increase tenfold,&quot; said Nabiki teasingly.
	Snorting Akane accepted the bowl of miso soup from
Kasumi then said, &quot;Don&#39;t remind me about that. I&#39;m already
getting a headache imagining what they&#39;ll be shouting about in
synchronization today.&quot;
	&quot;A-k-a-n-e. That&#39;s who we want to be!&quot; Nabiki said in
mocking sing-song tones as she walked into the room and sat
next to her younger sister. &quot;With thighs of milky white, she&#39;s
the one everyone likes. Gooooo Akane!&quot; After completing
this parody of the Furinkan High cheerleading squad Nabiki
broke out into laughter.
	&quot;Not funny,&quot; grumbled Akane while she sipped her
soup. &quot;I hate that cheer.&quot;
	After Akane said this Ranma and Kodachi
approached. This caused Nabiki to note that Genma pig was
missing and asked, &quot;You kill him?&quot;
	Snickering Ranma said, &quot;Nah. No luck with that. I
just punted him into the stratosphere so he wouldn&#39;t try
following us to school.&quot;
	&quot;School?&quot; questioned Nabiki curiously. &quot;So you&#39;re
planning on attending then?&quot;
	&quot;Certainly,&quot; Kodachi said, looking a bit nonplused at
Nabiki&#39;s surprise. &quot;Ranma darling and I both place great value
on the benefits of a fine education.&quot;
	&quot;Plus it&#39;s where we do a lot of our business,&quot; Ranma
said plainly before Kodachi lightly pinched her on the thigh
causing her to yelp. Coloring a bit she corrected, &quot;Learn to
do business I mean. Me and Dachi are interested in finance
you see and we gotta go to school for that. Understand?&quot;
	&quot;Yes,&quot; said Nabiki slowly as she carefully studied the
pair. &quot;I&#39;m beginning to.&quot;
	Laughing a bit nervously Ranma met Kodachi&#39;s gaze
then said conversationally, &quot;We have to take care of all the
bills and junk because my Pop&#39;s got such a lazy mind. You
see, there&#39;s no way that he could ever work out a good plan
on his own so it&#39;s up to us to handle things.&quot;
	&quot;Indeed,&quot; said Kodachi in agreement as she finished
the rest of Ranma&#39;s explanation. &quot;Saotome-san has very little
in the way of faculties. I find it most puzzling to ponder
exactly where your brains arrived from my dearest. One could
only conclude that his genetics are very weak, for they have
not adversely affected your eminence. Truly you have arrived
into an individual of obvious talents.&quot;
	Her lips forming a wide &#39;o&#39; shape Ranma flitted her
long eyelashes and formed a cutesy pose then said, &quot;Do you
really think so Dachi? I&#39;m so happy!&quot;
	Accepting the bowl of soup from Kasumi with a low
nod Kodachi replied dryly, &quot;You will have to endeavor to
improve your tone quality if you wish to righteously fool the
male population of our new institution of learning. Remember
that the more saccharine your voice levels are the more freely
they distribute their gifts. That and the lessening amounts of
clothing you wear. Do not forget that my darling.&quot;
	Mulling over this Ranma took her bowl of soup from
Kasumi then sat next to Kodachi and with her mouth full of
food said, &quot;I thought I did pretty good. It&#39;s not all that easy
pretending to be the sort of ditzy girl most guys think they go
for. Y&#39;know how stupid they want me to sound?&quot; Pausing she
slurped up the last of the soup and wiped her chin with the
long red silk sleeve to her shirt. &quot;Men are pigs. That&#39;s what I
learned most from having this curse. It ain&#39;t my fault that elf
chicks are so hot... but do they care? Nope. They chase after
me like rabid hounds.&quot; Eyeing Kodachi carefully cobalt eyes
narrowed and Ranma stated bluntly, &quot;We&#39;re telling everyone
on campus that we&#39;re a couple this time. I don&#39;t want another
crazy mob after me, so we stick close, got it Dachi? Just put
on your usual jealous spiel, okay? For both my forms.&quot;
	&quot;Very well,&quot; said Kodachi as she sighed with
exaggerated annoyance. &quot;If I must pretend to act irrationally
jealous over anyone it may as well be you Ranma darling.
And at times spewing that jealous spiel, as you so aptly call it,
can be somewhat amusing.&quot;
	&quot;Aw,&quot; drawled Ranma as she moved forward in a
lightning fast movement as she rested her face only inches
from Kodachi&#39;s. Her breath on the other girl&#39;s lips Ranma
whispered, &quot;But you like it dontcha Dachi? Telling everyone
that I belong to you...&quot;
	&quot;Ranma darling,&quot; Kodachi said huskily as she wound
her fingers into the back of Ranma&#39;s white-blonde head as to
draw the other girl&#39;s lips closer.
	&quot;Oh my,&quot; the voice of Kasumi broke in and turning
their heads the couple saw that she was blushing a deep hue
of red. Seeing their gaze on her she said quickly, &quot;Oh! I&#39;m so
sorry... it&#39;s just you two seem such good friends...&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;d say they&#39;re more than that Oneechan,&quot; Nabiki said
sardonically while hazel eyes roved over the almost entwined
Kodachi and Ranma in curious inspection. Next to her Akane
was simply gazing at the couple with interest. &quot;No wonder
you were so adamant about not wanting this engagement
Ranma. Have your sights set elsewhere, huh?&quot;
	Forming a lewd smile Ranma replied, &quot;Oh yeah. My
eyes and hands are definitely set elsewhere...&quot; As she said this
lithe hands spread out eagerly as she grabbed Kodachi&#39;s waist
only to yelp when the other girl lightly slapped her hands.
	&quot;Behave,&quot; purred Kodachi as she lightly rubbed the
blonde&#39;s hands. &quot;We should not continue to act so blatantly
romantic in front of our hosts.&quot; Directing her violet eyes to
the Tendo sisters said solemnly, &quot;As you may have guessed
there are some shared affections between Ranma dearest and
myself. This is yet another reason for his opposition to any
arranged engagements.&quot;
	Kodachi shook her head and said, &quot;That and the
simple fact that it&#39;s barbaric to try and control the lives of
others as our elders are attempting to do to us in this current
measure. To say the least it is horrendously wrong and we
plan on dissolving this forced engagement soon as able in
hopes that we all might return to our normal lives.&quot; The
gymnast paused to study their faces which so far all wore
neutral expressions. Almost hesitantly Kodachi asked, &quot;Is this
plan of ours to your acceptance?&quot;
	&quot;Fine with me,&quot; said Nabiki. She was relaxing a little
in her attitude towards the couple. Their first night in the dojo
had gone off without incident and if their current position was
anything to be judged by they should be considered allies of
sorts. Besides, Nabiki mused, it had been a long time since
she had met anyone with the level of savvy these two seemed
to possess. And so she continued, &quot;I&#39;d be grateful if you could
get rid of this engagement nuisance.&quot;
	Smiling softly Kasumi said, &quot;This certainly removes
any conflict between us, doesn&#39;t it? Since we know that
Ranma and Kodachi are a couple there&#39;s no reason to worry
about the engagement possibly proceeding.&quot;
	&quot;True,&quot; Nabiki said slowly. &quot;But we shouldn&#39;t let
Daddy find out that they&#39;re couple or you know what will
happen. It&#39;s lucky that he&#39;s sleeping in late today after
spending the night drinking and didn&#39;t hear any of this.&quot;
	&quot;That ain&#39;t lucky,&quot; snorted Ranma derisively. &quot;Pop
probably talked him into it. He&#39;ll do anything for free booze.&quot;
	&quot;As you say it, it is known to be true,&quot; said Kodachi
comically. Resting her violet eyes on Kasumi she studied the
eldest Tendo sister carefully. &quot;Surely it is a travesty that such
a lovely flower must be left to care for their sluggish whims. I
say now do not fall prone to following Saotome-san&#39;s wishes.
The pig deserves naught of your attention.&quot;
	&quot;Goodness,&quot; said Kasumi in surprise. &quot;You do seem
to resent him a great deal.&quot;
	&quot;We got plenty of reason,&quot; said Ranma. &quot;He&#39;s
engaged me off to those girls, he tries to mooch off of our
business, and there&#39;s all the times he tried to break up me and
Dachi just because she ain&#39;t an official iinazuke of mine. So
yeah... we resent him some. Pop&#39;s a real pain sometimes.&quot;
	Resting her chin in the palms of her hands Akane
smiled almost dreamily and said, &quot;You guys make such a
kawaii couple. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re together. There isn&#39;t enough
love in the world.&quot; After she said this Akane gave a happy
sigh then bounded to her feet. &quot;We better get going or we&#39;ll
be late for school.&quot; Looking to Nabiki as she put on her
backpack and questioned, &quot;Coming Oneechan?&quot;
	&quot;Of course,&quot; said Nabiki readily as she rose to her feet
and gathered her school supplies. &quot;It isn&#39;t like I would want to
miss the brilliant rhyming schemes of your admirers Akane.
They are simply so talented.&quot;
	&quot;Nabiki,&quot; said Akane wearily as she grabbed the
basketball that had been in the far corner of the room. &quot;No
more jokes about the cheerleaders. They&#39;re only doing what
they think is their job... besides, it&#39;s flattering.&quot; Akane turned
to look at Ranma and Kodachi, who were still in the midst of
their revealing embrace. &quot;What about you two? You did say
that you&#39;re going to school. Want to walk with us?&quot;
	&quot;We certainly would Akane,&quot; replied Kodachi as she
offered a charming smile while pulling away from Ranma who
looked disappointed at this. &quot;Any such assistance at being
able to introduce us to the particulars of your school would
be met with our ample thanks.&quot;
	Ranma wore a somewhat grumpy face as she stood
up. Walking next to Kodachi, she reached out to hold hands
as they followed the two Tendo sisters out the door.
	&quot;So,&quot; began Ranma. &quot;What&#39;s this Furinkan high like
anyway? Think the students there would be freaked out by
seeing my cursed form on the very first day?&quot;
	&quot;Why do you ask?&quot; said Nabiki curiously as she
studied Ranma who was swinging her and Kodachi&#39;s hands
back and forth. &quot;You&#39;re not planning on changing back?&quot;
	&quot;Depends,&quot; said Ranma as she shrugged her
shoulders. &quot;It might not be worth the effort, sometimes I&#39;ll
change back into a guy only to get splashed with cold water a
second later. Maybe I&#39;ll change back when we reach the
school but I dunno... don&#39;t bother me none either way.&quot;
	&quot;Well,&quot; Nabiki said slowly, looking to see that Akane
was maintaining a steady pace ahead of them as she dribbled
her basketball at a rapid pace. &quot;It depends on the amount of
admirers my little sister will have waiting this morning. If it&#39;s
the usual number no one will probably notice you until you
get to homeroom. But after that they&#39;ll keep track of you for
sure. New students who are good looking and know martial
arts always grab interest at Furinkan.&quot; With a smirk Nabiki
drawled, &quot;And you&#39;re going to raise plenty of eyebrows by
just looking like that, Ranma. Even in Nerima elves aren&#39;t the
norm.&quot;
	&quot;Oh?&quot; queried Kodachi. &quot;And what, pray tell, is
considered the norm within this humble district?&quot;
	Shading her hazel eyes Nabiki smiled smugly as if in
expectation of something then replied, &quot;That.&quot;
	Following the direction Nabiki was gazing in Ranma
and Kodachi observed the front walk to Furinkan high school
which was lined on either side with what looked to be around
a hundred students who all wore almost the exact same face
of adoration. Several of the girls seemed to swoon as Akane
stepped a foot onto the campus, while a good portion of the
boys began drooling.
	Akane didn&#39;t seem to notice this as she kept her light
brown eyes facing steadily forward as she continued to
dribble her basketball while walking towards the entrance to
Furinkan. She stopped suddenly and looked at a group of ten
girls all wearing identical uniforms and eagerly hopeful looks
on their pretty faces. There was a long pause before Akane
ceased the dribbling of her basketball to now spin it on her
index finger as she faced the girls and said bemused, &quot;Go on.
It&#39;s okay... I know you want to.&quot;
	The girls released simultaneous squeals of happiness
as they bounced up and down. They then cleared their throats
then in perfect harmony chanted, &quot;Akane everyone loves so
much and only she everyone wants to touch!&quot;
	After they said this, the girls looked expectantly at
Akane who stopped spinning the basketball on her index
finger and said, &quot;Nice job. Your rhyming is improving.&quot; Now
finished, Akane strode towards the front entrance to Furinkan
and went inside.
	Seconds after Akane entered the building over half of
the crowd stormed in to follow her and in doing so looked
quite like a group of occultists. Leaving scarcely any people
remaining in the school yard. Still standing at the entrance to
the Furinkan campus Nabiki was gratified to see the puzzled
and intrigued looks on Ranma and Kodachi&#39;s faces.
	&quot;What...?&quot; began Ranma hesitantly.
	&quot;Was that of concern to?&quot; finished Kodachi.
	&quot;Akane&#39;s fan club,&quot; said Nabiki in dry explanation.
&quot;She&#39;s Furinkan&#39;s top athlete and is pretty much responsible
for the championship seasons of the girls basketball, softball,
soccer, volleyball, track, and diving team. And these are all
the people who worship her for it.&quot; Nabiki paused a moment
to inspect the abandoned yard then mused, &quot;But today was a
pretty small gathering. Only two hundred or so people. She
usually has a minimum of four hundred people greeting her.
It&#39;s that damn flu that&#39;s going around...&quot;
	Proceeding to walk inside the school Nabiki left the
forms of Ranma and Kodachi standing at the front entrance
wearing stunned expressions on their faces.

	Displaying their most charming smiles Kodachi and a
now male Ranma stood in front of their homeroom class. All
eyes were on them except for Akane who looked bored as
she tossed a softball lazily into the air and caught it.
	&quot;All right class,&quot; said the Sensei as he looked up
briefly from the piece of paper he was reading. &quot;It seems we
have two new students at Furinkan. Meet Kuno Kodachi and
Saotome Ranma. They&#39;ve just returned from a long training
journey in China so lets all give them a warm welcome.&quot; The
Sensei smiled then said, &quot;Perhaps you&#39;d like to tell the class a
little about yourselves?&quot;
	&quot;Most assuredly,&quot; replied Kodachi smoothly. She
snapped her violet ribbon into her grasp and began twirling it
in a circular motion. &quot;While my name is Kuno Kodachi, I am
also known as the black rose. The color black being chosen
for its rarity amongst all the flowers. As rare as my talents in
martial arts rhythmic gymnastics which is my chosen athletic
sport. I am readily looking forward to spending time with the
captivating creatures in my present company, each of whom
share a distinctive bewitching appeal. Those of the male
persuasion are particularly strong in charm.&quot;
	Kodachi paused to eye Ranma slyly and she diverted
her ribbon to wrap it around his waist. &quot;A final note, Ranma
dearest and I are committed to one another in a most
satisfying romantic relationship. Although I find many of the
males present attractive I am afraid that I yearn for no other
than him in the ways of love.&quot;
	There was a slight silence as the Sensei blinked and
said, &quot;Do you have anything to add to that Ranma?&quot;
	&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Ranma as he flashed a bright smile.
&quot;With so many pretty girls around I think I&#39;m gonna like it
here at Furinkan. It almost makes me wish I was single again
but I&#39;m a faithful guy so I&#39;ll just have to work out all my
unfulfilled frustrations by practicing the art. Then again, being
the best fighter I can be is my duty as the heir to the Anything
Goes school of martial arts.&quot; His cobalt eyes sparkling he
turned to the Sensei and said, &quot;That&#39;s all I gotta to say.&quot;
	When he finished the Sensei cleared his throat then
said slowly, &quot;Thank you both. Please take the empty seats
next to Hiroshi and Daisuke.&quot;
	Following the Sensei&#39;s instructions Ranma and
Kodachi took their seats next to the two boys who&#39;d been
indicated to. Immediately Hiroshi and Daisuke, along with all
the other boys present, scooted their desks towards Kodachi.
	It was a gesture that didn&#39;t go unnoticed by Ranma
and Kodachi who were also watching the more subtle
movement of the girls desks heading closer to Ranma. The
only person who didn&#39;t gravitate towards one out of the
couple was Akane who was still occupying herself by tossing
her softball into the air and catching it. Observing the
admiring attention that they were receiving from their fellow
students Kodachi and Ranma exchanged satisfied smiles while
wearing smug expressions.
	And watching this entire scene the Sensei known as
Godai Yusaku sighed as he saw two more idols for Furinkan
High School being made.

	Walking into the cafeteria Nabiki scanned the
crowded surroundings until she located the forms of Kodachi
and Ranma. They were sitting alone and were in the midst of
what looked to be an intense discussion. What made the
couple stand out most was the enormous pile of food they
had sitting in front of them which they were eating at a slow
and steady pace.
	Striding towards them Nabiki slapped her ledger
lightly down on the surface of their table and said, &quot;Want to
tell me why I&#39;ve gotten over a hundred information requests
about you two in the past half hour alone? What&#39;d you do?
Start a riot in homeroom?&quot;
	Proffering a piece of a pork bun to Ranma who
happily accepted it Kodachi looked from the ledger then to
Nabiki and said, &quot;We merely introduced ourselves to our
classmates. Isn&#39;t that right Ranma dearest?&quot;
	&quot;Give the lady a prize,&quot; drawled Ranma as he flashed
a winning smile. &quot;Cause she&#39;s right on the money.&quot; Lifting
cobalt eyes he smiled at Nabiki. &quot;Dachi&#39;s right. All we did is
give the usual song and dance when you&#39;re a new student to
our homeroom class. That&#39;s all. You can ask Akane if you
don&#39;t believe us. She was there.&quot;
	&quot;Why is it,&quot; Nabiki drawled as she took a seat next to
Ranma. &quot;That I don&#39;t believe it was as simple as you&#39;re
making it out to be?&quot;
	Feeding Ranma a spoonful of ice cream Kodachi
shrugged. &quot;I cannot help that you still feel mistrustful towards
us Tendo Nabiki. The truth be told all we did was introduce
ourselves to the humble students of Furinkan. Their interest
in us is to be chalked up to plain curiosity.&quot;
	Hazel eyes narrowed a notch as Nabiki watched
Ranma rip off a piece of melon bread and offer it to Kodachi
who took in between her lips in a sensuous gesture. Despite
herself Nabiki felt her blood heat at the sight of two such
beautiful people being so openly affectionate towards each
other. Shaking her head Nabiki focused back on her task and
said, &quot;Whatever you did the student body wants to know
everything about the two of you. Which leads me as to why
I&#39;m here.&quot; Pausing Nabiki shuffled through her notes and
continued, &quot;Should I use my normal methods of obtaining
information or are you both willing to fill out these forms and
save me the trouble?&quot;
	Ceasing their eating the couple accepted the pieces of
paper from Nabiki and studied them carefully. Finally Ranma
formed a smirk and said, &quot;Pretty detailed stuff Nabiki. But do
they really gotta know my pants size? I ain&#39;t even sure that I
know that one...&quot;
	&quot;Waist thirty, inseam thirty-two,&quot; said Kodachi
immediately while wearing a small smile.
	&quot;Heh,&quot; chuckled Ranma as he tossed a tiny apple slice
at Kodachi who easily caught it between her fingers. &quot;How
do you know that Dachi?&quot;
	&quot;Educated guess,&quot; replied Kodachi teasingly as she
tossed the apple slice into her mouth and munched on it. She
averted her violet eyes to Nabiki and questioned, &quot;And what
benefits are we to reap by giving out such private information
about our persons to you? Surely we deserve remuneration
for cooperating in a business endeavor focused upon us.&quot;
	Her hazel eyes narrowing by another notch Nabiki
asked, &quot;What do you want?&quot;
	The couple exchanged a serious look for a moment
then Ranma replied, &quot;We don&#39;t know the score about this
town or this school. It&#39;d be awfully nice to have someone on
the inside helping us...&quot; Smiling rakishly Ranma said, &quot;We
wanna work with you Nabiki. It didn&#39;t take long to figure out
that you&#39;re the person to talk to when it comes to running
schemes at this place.&quot;
	&quot;And since we are residing at your home,&quot; Kodachi
smoothly cut in. &quot;It was the natural choice to ally ourselves
with you in our business plans rather than oppose you in your
financial tasks.&quot;
	&quot;You want to work for me?&quot; questioned Nabiki a bit
dazed at this unexpected turn of events. In a few seconds the
people she considered the greatest threat to her business were
offering their loyalty to her.
	The couple wore identical frowns and Ranma was the
first to speak. &quot;No... we didn&#39;t say that. We wanna work with
you,&quot; he corrected.
	&quot;The three of us,&quot; Kodachi purred, moving sleekly
across the table to touch Nabiki&#39;s chin lightly with her index
finger. &quot;Would make a magnificent team.&quot;
	&quot;So what about it?&quot; asked Ranma, lazily tracing the
barest path down Nabiki&#39;s arm. &quot;Wanna be our partner? We
could come up with some beautiful scores together...&quot;
	Swallowing the lump in her throat Nabiki shifted her
gaze from Ranma to Kodachi and found herself drawn in by
the intoxicating shine located there. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said hoarsely.
&quot;I think you&#39;re right.&quot;
	&quot;Wonderful,&quot; purred Kodachi as she pulled back. &quot;I&#39;m
so pleased to be working with such a beauteous figure. Aren&#39;t
you in agreement Ranma darling?&quot;
	&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Ranma said as his fingers retreated from
their light touch on Nabiki&#39;s arm. &quot;In total agreement.&quot;
	Snapping out of the dazed state she&#39;d been placed in
due to the couple&#39;s attentions Nabiki blinked then returning to
her usual self smirked and said, &quot;Well partners of mine this
looks to me like the start of a beautiful business relationship.&quot;
	&quot;I couldn&#39;t have said it better...&quot; said Ranma with a
smile as he took Nabiki&#39;s hand and lightly kissed the top of it.
He lifted his gaze to burn an intense stare into hazel eyes and
finished, &quot;Partner.&quot;
	Coloring a bit Nabiki reluctantly pulled her hand out
of Ranma&#39;s hold and shifting her eyes to Kodachi she saw that
the gymnast was observing them with fond amusement.
Seeing Nabiki&#39;s surprise Kodachi said, &quot;Do not fret Nabiki
dearest. There is little cause for me to feel any jealousy
towards you for Ranma merely acknowledging your allure.&quot;
Rising smoothly to her feet Kodachi stepped forward to
extend her hand to Ranma, who was now on his feet, and
walking away with him she said, &quot;Especially when I most
completely agree with and share his admiration.&quot;
	Glancing backwards at the bewildered Nabiki a
smiling Ranma called, &quot;See you later partner!&quot;
	&quot;What,&quot; began Nabiki numbly as she stared blankly
ahead. &quot;Have I just gotten myself into?&quot;

	When the school day ended Nabiki found Kodachi
leaning against the large oak tree in the front yard to Furinkan
while Ranma was hanging upside down on a high tree branch.
	&quot;Hi,&quot; Nabiki said. &quot;You didn&#39;t have to wait for me.&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s no problem,&quot; said Ranma cheerfully as he swung
back in forth at a steady pace. &quot;We wanted to.&quot;
	&quot;Correct,&quot; said Kodachi with a smile. &quot;We wished to
tell you that we will be departing on a short errand before
returning to the dojo. Will you convey this to the others and
null any such violent reactions Nabiki dearest?&quot;
	&quot;Sure,&quot; said Nabiki slowly as she eyed Kodachi with
curious hazel eyes.
	&quot;Where&#39;s Akane?&quot; asked Ranma. He began to swing
at a fast pace before he suddenly shifted his legs and flipped
off the tree branch to stand next to Kodachi.
	&quot;She&#39;s at practice,&quot; replied Nabiki, gesturing towards
the gym. &quot;Today it&#39;s basketball and volleyball. She&#39;ll be in
there for awhile so there&#39;s no need to wait for her.&quot;
	&quot;Ah,&quot; said Kodachi thoughtfully. &quot;Well we must be
making our exit to take care of some private business. You
will make excuses for us, will you not?&quot;
	Before Nabiki could reply the couple joined hands and
stealthily bounded off the school grounds. Alone now, she
said to herself, &quot;I wonder why they&#39;re acting so secretive?&quot;

	Halting in their easy run Ranma and Kodachi stood
before an abandoned mansion, a sight which stood out very
clearly in an otherwise normal looking neighborhood. The
black haired gymnast leapt from the high wall they&#39;d been
running on to slowly walk towards the rusted wrought iron
gates that were locked with heavy chains. Touching the gate
lightly Kodachi whispered, &quot;Home.&quot;
	Approaching quietly from behind Ranma drew his
arms around her waist and murmured into her ear, &quot;We finally
found it Dachi. And someday we&#39;ll find him too. The both of
them. Our sources say they&#39;re traveling together.&quot;
	&quot;Yes,&quot; breathed Kodachi, mesmerized as she looked
at her ancestral estate. Without looking down she produced a
metal hammer in her grasp and sending it smashing down she
broke the locks that held the gate shut. Pushing the gates
open she once again walked on the lawn to the home that she
was taken away from so long ago and said, &quot;Tatewaki... I
have searched not only the scant memories of my past but
every resource available to find the home in which we once
dwelled but where must I search to find you? Each time I
attempt to locate you I return with an empty hand and a
broken heart.&quot; Kodachi looked towards the heavens and
questioned, &quot;Where are you now my brother? I beg that you
return from whence you came.&quot;

	And at that same moment, in the wilderness of China,
the well traveled figure of Kuno Tatewaki released an abrupt
sneeze before he laid his eyes on the cursed training grounds
of Jusenkyo.
