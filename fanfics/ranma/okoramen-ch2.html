<h1>An Okonmiyaki and Ramen Love Story (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cmartel.html">Christopher Martel</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/okoramen-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>After closing the restaurant and changing Ukyo left
for the Cat Cafe to meet Shampoo then head to the
theater. The walk to the cafe was nothing special as
Ukyo walked through the crowd of people heading
towards their destinations. It only took her about
five minutes to reach the cafe and she saw the duo of
Mousse and Shampoo cleaning the restaurant that stood
empty. Ukyo tapped the door and Shampoo waved her in
and told her to sit down.

Ukyo grabbed the table closest to the door and was
about to sit down when a raspy voice said &quot;Don&#39;t sit
down.&quot; Ukyo jumped and fell on the floor and saw the
small form of Cologne sitting with a cup of tea in her
hand. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Cologne.&quot; Cologne just said &quot;Do not
worry about it. Now take the seat next to me.&quot; Ukyo
did as she was told and sat next to the ancient
martial artist.

&quot;How was business young one?&quot; the old ghoul asked
pouring her a cup of tea. &quot;Rather busy throughout the
whole day. Since I&#39;m open all day now people just
flock in.&quot; Cologne smirked and said &quot;Welcome to the
world of restaurants. Don&#39;t worry about it though
somedays will be fast other days will be slow so every
now and then you&#39;ll get a break.&quot; 

Ukyo sighed and drained her glass a split second
before Shampoo came over and said &quot;All done
grandmother am I allowed to leave?&quot; Cologne just
replied &quot;Be back by one granddaughter.&quot; Shampoo smiled
and said &quot;Thank you. I be back soon.&quot; &quot;WAIT
SHAMPOO.....&quot; SPLASH! and all of Mousse&#39;s rantings
became loud quacks of pleading. &quot;Sorry Mousse. Girls
night you go next time.&quot; At those words Mousse shut
his mouth and picked up a rag and for some reason
started scrubbing the floors. &quot;Let&#39;s go Ukyo.&quot;

They said goodbye and took to the roofs so they could
get their in time for the movie. The trip took 10
minutes and soon they were in the theater watching the
fourth movie in the Hannibal series &quot;Red Dragon.&quot; The
theater was dark and the only light came from the
screen. The movie was more psychological than violent
and not too many scary parts. But as the main
character was in the middle of an investigation
something happened that caused Shampoo to gasp and
clasp Ukyos arm in need of comfort.

The motion caused Ukyo to blush in embarrassment and
was glad that Shampoo couldn&#39;t see her face as it was
burning bright red. Throughout the rest of the movie
Shampoo didn&#39;t let go of Ukyo&#39;s arm making Ukyo
concentrate more on the cringing, painful feeling of
Shampoos grip.

After the movie they left the theater and headed to
find something to eat and Shampoo still had her arm on
Ukyos and Ukyo didn&#39;t mind until she noticed the looks
that they were getting and finally decided to say
something.

&quot;UH...Shampoo?&quot; Shampoo looked at Ukyo and asked &quot;What
wrong Ukyo?&quot; Ukyo sighed and said &quot;Ya think you could
let go of my arm?&quot; Shampoo finally noticed that she
had not let go of Ukyos arm and blushed profusely.
&quot;Sorry. Shampoo not mean to do that.&quot; Ukyo giggled and
said &quot;That&#39;s alright I understand but let&#39;s make sure
that it doesn&#39;t happen all that often.&quot; She looked at
Shampoo who had a look of extreme embarrassment on her
face. &quot;What&#39;s the matter sug you look like you did
something bad.&quot; Shampoo shook her head and said &quot;I
just disappointed at myself. I&#39;m an Amazon. Yet I got
scared at one little thing. If tribe were to hear I be
laughing stock.&quot;  Shampoo felt Ukyo shaking and asked
&quot;You cold Ukyo?&quot; but when she saw that she was
laughing silently Shampoo felt anger rather than
embarrassment.

&quot;What so funny?!  Amazon not supposed to show fear! IT
shows weakness and we supposed to be strong.!.&quot; The
tone of Shampoos voice made Ukyo stop laughing and say
&quot;You&#39;re mad at yourself for getting scared. It&#39;s not
that bad of . I bet even the bravest Amazon has shown
fear at some point in their life.&quot; Shampoo took this
into account and suddenly it hit her &quot;You right
Ucchan. Shampoo have no reason to feel shame for
getting afraid. Thank you Ukyo!!!&quot; and threw her arms
around Ukyo and hugged her hard. Ukyo felt good about
comforting her friend but she was more worried about
suffocating  at the moment. 

&quot;Shampoo, can you let me go? AIR!!!!!&quot; Shampoo heard
her last part and let her go. &quot;Sorry. I got excited.&quot;
Ukyo caught her breath and just said &quot;No harm. Let&#39;s
go home.&quot; Shampoo nodded and they headed back to the
Cat Cafe. 

Once their Ukyo walked up to the door with Shampoo
just to be nice and make sure she was alright. As they
stood outside the back door Shampoo turned to Ukyo and
said &quot;Ukyo, thank you for comforting Shampoo earlier.&quot;
Ukyo smiled and said &quot;No problem. Any good friend
would help another one out.&quot; Shampoo shook her head
and said. &quot;It big deal to me. Shampoo forget we no
longer in China and have no reason to hide feelings
so...&quot; Shampoo took Ukyos hand and hers and squeezed
it tenderly and affectionately. &quot;Thank you.&quot; was all
the amazon said and headed in leaving a dumbfounded
Ukyo standing behind the restaurant.

Ukyo sat there for about 5 minutes before she got over
what had just happened and left for home.

Once in her bed she sat there staring at the ceiling
thinking to herself What the hell was that all about?
Does Shampoo have feelings for me? The thought of
Shampoo being in love with her made the chef burst out
laughing. &quot;HA HA! Like she loves me. It was probably
jsut a spur of the moment thing. Yeah that was all
just a random moment of closeness.&quot; And coming to that
conclusion she turned over and slept while her
subconcious said Just keep telling yourself that. Keep
hiding the true you from the world.

There you guys go. I jsut realized that for some
reason in each of my Yuri fics i have something
dealing with movies. Oh well. R&amp;R
