<h1>Black Rose, Blue Thunder (part 8 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/blakrose-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>	Meteorologists are said to have an easy work life because 
their jobs are the only ones where they can be wrong and not be 
punished for it. Even the ones who work on television are allowed 
this gap in their job performance.

	This is because it&#39;s not easy predicting the weather. The 
weather is a mysterious thing as it&#39;s controlled by forces beyond 
man and his science.

	Yes, Meteorologists have an easy work life.

	Unless they happened to live in Nerima, Japan.

	It was unfortunate for Tamashi Renzo that he just happened 
to live in Nerima and he also just happened to be the chief 
Meteorologist for Channel 67 Nerima News.

	Today Renzo had predicted on his morning broadcast that it 
would be a sunny all day long without a hint of rain.

	And his prediction was correct, the day was sunny.

	It was sunny for about an hour after his broadcast. Then the 
dark clouds floated in. Then the strange crashes of lightning 
sounded. And then finally, the rain started.

	But it wasn&#39;t normal rain.

	No, Renzo had lived in Nerima for far too long to expect to 
see normal rain. The rain that they got could be described as 
anything but normal since it was localized in one small section 
of their district.

	The thing that Renzo couldn&#39;t figure out was this: Why was 
Furinkan High so special? Why were they the only place in Nerima 
getting this weird localized rain?

	Then Renzo did what he always did when he started 
contemplating Nerima&#39;s always inconceivable weather.

	After five minutes, he gave up trying to understand it.

------------------------------------------------

	A low rumble filled the air and looking up at the sky which 
was darkening at a speed that he found most unnatural, Tatewaki&#39;s 
tawny eyes widened in slight panic.

	&quot;This,&quot; Tatewaki said slowly. &quot;Is most ill-timed.&quot;

	Before he had the chance to begin a quick run for Furinkan 
High&#39;s main building, Tatewaki found himself utterly drenched from 
the sudden downpour of rain.

	In seconds, Tatewaki was buried in a pile of his own wet 
clothes as he was transformed into the figure of a small and puffy 
chicken-like phoenix. Tatewaki squinted his now beady black eyes 
and released a series of squawks which expressed his displeasure 
about being in his cursed form.

	Soaking wet, Tatewaki phoenix fluttered a little off of the 
ground as he wasn&#39;t used to flying yet, and settled under an 
umbrella with several students. And while he did so, he couldn&#39;t 
help but listen into their conversation.

	&quot;Where&#39;s Shampoo?&quot;

	&quot;We have to defeat her in battle!&quot;

	&quot;Yes, just like Grocery Bag said!&quot;

	&quot;We obey the words of Grocery Bag!&quot;

	There was a slight pause before someone said, &quot;Should we 
really be taking the advice of a person called Grocery Bag? I 
mean, it&#39;s a pretty stupid name.&quot;

	&quot;But so is Shampoo.&quot;

	There was another pause before someone shouted, &quot;Infidel! 
Shampoo is a glorious name!&quot;

	&quot;Glorious? I wouldn&#39;t go that far. It&#39;s okay.&quot;

	&quot;No... it&#39;s kind of stupid, Shiro.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, really stupid.&quot;

	&quot;I dunno, that other Amazon chick those weird guys in the 
corner of the yard like has a strange name.&quot;

	&quot;Chocolate Kiss? Yeah, that&#39;s weird.&quot;

	&quot;I thought it was Hershey&#39;s Kiss.&quot;

	&quot;Now those are the best.&quot;

	&quot;Nah, I like Reeces Pieces.&quot;

	&quot;What the hell kind of name is that?&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s not a name, man. It&#39;s a candy.&quot;

	Listening to the conversation, Tatewaki phoenix&#39;s eyes 
narrowed and turning his feathered head, he looked to see Shampoo 
nearing the school. Recalling what the strange students had said 
about wanting to defeat her, Tatewaki phoenix fluttered off of the 
ground and flew towards Shampoo as fast as he could manage.

	Which meant by the time that Shampoo reached the front 
entrance to Furinkan High he was barely halfway there. Fortunately 
for Tatewaki, the Amazon saw his struggling and rather pitiful 
attempt at flight and ran towards him.

	Lowering her hands underneath Tatewaki phoenix so that he 
could land on them, Shampoo stared at him as he was busy 
breathing heavily. After a moment, he opened his beak and began 
squawking at the top of his lungs while he flapped his small and 
very chicken-like wings about as he did so.

	&quot;Tachi?&quot; asked Shampoo. She shielded the onset of the once 
heavy rainstorm which was now a light drizzle from her eyes. &quot;Why 
you make such noise?&quot;

	At this question, Tatewaki phoenix squawked so loud that his 
eyes almost bulged out of his head and he flapped his wings as fast 
as he could while turning around in Shampoo&#39;s hands. Following his 
strange turnabout, Shampoo looked up just in time to see a large 
crowd of people charging at her.

	Watching as the crowd neared her with obvious battle 
intentions, Shampoo could say only one thing.

	&quot;Aiyaah.&quot;

---

	Perfume was unhappy.

	It was something that seemed to happen far too often for her 
tastes. Especially since she&#39;d gotten her curse.

	Because if there was one thing that Perfume hated it was 
being in her pixie form. Something embarrassing always seemed to 
happen to her when she was in it.

	And Perfume hated being embarrassed.

	Therefore, Perfume hated being in her pixie form more than 
anything else in the world.

	It was too bad for Perfume that as she was making her way to 
the Tendo dojo to visit with her Airen a woman dumped her dishwater 
out of her window at the exact same time that Perfume was walking 
underneath it.

	This left a very unhappy and extremely grouchy Perfume as 
she flew along the usual path to the Tendo dojo from several miles 
into the air as she wanted to keep as far away from people and 
their bug zappers as she could.

	If Perfume was lucky this would be the worst thing that ended 
up happening to her as a pixie.

	It was also too bad for Perfume that she was anything but 
lucky. At least while she was in her cursed form.

	She had just made it halfway to the Tendo dojo when she 
heard the sound of screaming voices of people nearing her. Perfume 
paused in her flight and turned her tiny golden frame around as her 
kawaii face scrunched up in puzzlement.

	&quot;Tink, tink?&quot; Perfume murmured to herself.

	Perfume was still puzzling over this when her sapphire eyes 
took in the sight of nearly a hundred people, all of which looked 
severely injured, came flying at and then directly into her as they 
all began to head on a crash course for the ground below.

	As they flew towards the ground at top speeds Perfume could 
make out several screams of the injured.

	&quot;I told you not to listen to him!&quot;

	&quot;Curse you, Grocery Bag!&quot;

	&quot;She&#39;s a brute! How did she get so strong?!

	&quot;Owww! My ovaries!&quot;

	&quot;I can&#39;t feel my butt!&quot;

	&quot;I vote that we disband the Shampoo fan club!&quot;

	&quot;I second that motion! She&#39;s a monster!&quot;

	&quot;A monster who wears a chicken on her head!&quot;

	&quot;Club disbanded! Club disbanded!&quot;

	Seconds later, they all crashed into the ground to form a 
large pile of injured bodies that had a very unlucky Perfume 
buried at the bottom of it.

	The really sad thing was, this probably wasn&#39;t going to be 
the worst thing that ended up happening to Perfume.

	Sometimes, it just doesn&#39;t pay to be a pixie.

------------------------------------------------

	Ranma took one look at the chicken sitting on top of 
Shampoo&#39;s head before she burst into laughter.

	&quot;Man,&quot; Ranma wheezed through her laughter. &quot;Is that thing 
stupid looking or what?&quot;

	At this, Tatewaki phoenix squawked loudly before he leaned 
forward to peck Ranma on the forehead several times.

	&quot;Augh! Hey, quit it you stupid bird!&quot; cried Ranma as she 
batted her hands at Tatewaki phoenix who was puffing up while he 
settled back in his sitting place on Shampoo&#39;s head.

	&quot;That what you get,&quot; said Shampoo smugly. &quot;For insulting 
Tachi. Is not his fault have such a strange curse.&quot;

	There was a slight pause before Ranma began laughing even 
louder as Kodachi looked at Shampoo with wide eyes.

	&quot;You mean to say that is my dear brother, Tatewaki, in his 
cursed Jusenkyo form?&quot; asked Kodachi in mild shock.

	&quot;Yes,&quot; Shampoo nodded. &quot;Tachi fall into spring of drowned 
phoenix when at Jusenkyo. He make mistake of try to interfere in 
Shampoo battle with stupid Mousse and this is result.&quot;

	&quot;Tachi,&quot; said Kodachi softly as she neared Tatewaki phoenix 
who looked at her with sheepish beady black eyes. &quot;I suppose that 
it could have been worse, my brother.&quot;

	&quot;Oh yeah? How?&quot; Ranma managed through her laughter. &quot;He 
don&#39;t look like a phoenix to me. He looks like a big stupid 
looking puffed up chicken.&quot;

	At this comment, Tatewaki phoenix narrowed his eyes which 
flashed with fire and that was when Ranma got struck by lightning 
for the eighty-first time.

	&quot;Aiyaah,&quot; Shampoo said in low tones of amazement. &quot;No 
matter how many time Shampoo see that happen, it still take her by 
surprise anyway.&quot;

	&quot;Darling,&quot; Kodachi murmured with a sigh as she looked at 
Ranma&#39;s crumpled and charred form lying on the floor. &quot;We don&#39;t 
have time for this, we&#39;re going to be late for class.&quot;

	Tatewaki phoenix squawked loudly at this and looking up at 
him, Shampoo said, &quot;That right. Need to get Tachi some hot water.&quot; 
Turning to Kodachi she said, &quot;I see you later, am going to take 
Tachi to the boys room.&quot;

	With that, Shampoo dashed away while Kodachi watched 
their exit and said in amusement, &quot;She&#39;s going to take my brother 
inside of the boys lavatory? Now that&#39;s something I&#39;d like to see 
just for entertainment purposes.&quot;

	Hauling a dazed Ranma onto her back, Kodachi started up the 
stairs and towards their homeroom when a random thought surfaced 
in always her busy mind.

	&quot;I wonder where Nabiki darling and Ryoga are?&quot;

-------------------------------------------------

	Ryoga was lost.

	It was the worst and most consistent thing that happened to 
him throughout his entire life.

	But worse yet, he had gotten Nabiki lost with him and from 
the looks of it she wasn&#39;t happy about the situation.

	Heaving a deep sigh, Nabiki tried to control her annoyance. 
Turning to Ryoga, she took in his downtrodden and guilty features 
and felt all her annoyance melt completely away. How could she be 
mad at someone like him? Ryoga didn&#39;t mean to get them lost. It 
was only an accident and it wasn&#39;t like he meant to do it.

	Giving him a soft smile, Nabiki said teasingly, &quot;Well now I 
know for sure that all of those stories about your bad sense of 
direction are definitely not exaggerations.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Ryoga sadly as he sighed. Looking around he 
said, &quot;I can&#39;t figure out how we got here though. And so quickly 
at that. I just was trying to walk you to your homeroom but this 
doesn&#39;t look anything like it.&quot;

	&quot;That&#39;s probably because this is Yokohama and not my 
homeroom back at Furinkan,&quot; remarked Nabiki in dry tones.

	&quot;Yokohama?&quot; said Ryoga blankly. &quot;How do you know that&#39;s 
where we are?&quot;

	&quot;Because of that,&quot; Nabiki said slowly as she turned Ryoga 
around so that he could look at the huge sign that said welcome to 
Yokohama on it in big bold letters.

	&quot;Oh,&quot; said Ryoga rather sheepishly.

	Looking at her embarrassed iinazuke, Nabiki sighed then gave 
him a smile as she said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Ryoga-kun. We should look 
on the bright side of things.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ryoga agreed. &quot;The bright side.&quot; He paused for a 
moment then asked haplessly, &quot;What&#39;s the bright side?&quot;

	&quot;Well,&quot; Nabiki drawled in slow humorous tones. &quot;I&#39;d say the 
bright side is we get some time off of school today.&quot;

	&quot;Some time?&quot; repeated Ryoga. He paused to form a wide 
smile and said, &quot;Why not all day? Lets go sightseeing! I know some 
great places around here, Nabiki-chan.&quot;

	&quot;Sightseeing?&quot; murmured Nabiki. &quot;I don&#39;t know. We&#39;ll be 
marked as skipping class if we don&#39;t get back soon and--&quot;

	&quot;No we won&#39;t,&quot; Ryoga interrupted. His dark brown eyes 
twinkled slightly as he produced a phone card out of thin air. &quot;All 
we need to do is call our fathers and say that we want to go out on 
another date. They&#39;re sure to agree if we say that. And anyway,&quot; 
Ryoga smiled. &quot;We deserve some time off since everyone stuck us 
with this engagement.&quot;

	&quot;Ryoga-kun,&quot; said Nabiki in slow and sensuous tones. &quot;I do 
love the way that you think.&quot;

	&quot;Thanks,&quot; replied Ryoga as he blushed lightly. &quot;So should we 
go ahead and call them then?&quot;

	&quot;Definitely,&quot; said Nabiki with a smile. &quot;But let me lead the 
way to the nearest pay phone, huh?&quot;

	&quot;Of course,&quot; Ryoga said as he blushed again.

	Studying Ryoga closely, Nabiki came to a internal decision 
and hooked her arm in Ryoga&#39;s and said, &quot;So what do we see first, 
Ryoga-kun? You&#39;re our guide... to an extent.&quot;

	&quot;The old temple,&quot; squeaked Ryoga as he turned a dark red 
hue. After a moment, he looked at Nabiki and then formed a slow 
smile as he did so.

	Maybe getting lost wasn&#39;t so bad after all.

	As long as he had someone like Nabiki with him.

--------------------------------------------------

	Godai Yusaku was a good teacher. At least by Furinkan High 
standards as he could handle most any strange goings on with a 
nominally cool head and easy attitude.

	Yes, Godai was a good teacher at Furinkan High.

	But even a good teacher can&#39;t teach and keep the attention 
of the class when one of his students is constantly getting struck 
by lightning during their lessons.

	So Godai did as any good teacher, at least one at Furinkan 
High, would do. He decided to figure out just what was going on 
with Saotome Ranma.

	Godai looked at Ranma&#39;s smoking form, which had just 
recently been struck by lightning for the eighty-sixth time, and 
then gazed at Kodachi. &quot;How long has this been going on?&quot; he 
asked.

	&quot;Since yesterday, Sensei,&quot; Kodachi replied politely.

	&quot;And why is it going on?&quot; asked Godai.

	&quot;The old ghoul,&quot; Ranma growled as she hastily pushed herself 
to her feet and clenched her hand into a fist. &quot;She did it to me! 
She gave me this cursed amulet!&quot;

	There was a moment of pause as the class stared at the 
revived Ranma in shock before someone said, &quot;He&#39;s alive.&quot;

	&quot;What a man... woman... elf... err, yeah.&quot;

	&quot;Check it out, the lightning crashed a hole all the way down 
to classroom 2b. That&#39;s pretty cool.&quot;

	&quot;It would&#39;ve hit that idiot Yoshi if he was here.&quot;
	
	&quot;Class!&quot; said Godai in annoyed tones. &quot;Please be quiet.&quot; 
Turning back to Kodachi he said, &quot;The old ghoul?&quot;

	&quot;The Matriarch of the Joketsuzoku tribe of Amazons from 
China,&quot; supplied Kodachi helpfully.

	&quot;You mean Shampoo&#39;s Great Grandmother?&quot; Godai said. He 
then turned to look where Shampoo was supposed to be sitting and 
asked, &quot;Where is Shampoo, anyway?&quot;

	&quot;She&#39;s in the boys lavatory, Sensei,&quot; Kodachi said. 

	&quot;What&#39;s she doing in there?!&quot; exclaimed Godai as his eyes 
grew wide. He could swear that all of his students were becoming 
more and more bizarre with every passing day.

	&quot;She&#39;s helping Kuno change,&quot; said Ranma in dismissive tones. 
She walked up to Godai and formed a pretty smile. &quot;Can I be 
excused from class, Sensei? Pleaaase?&quot;

	&quot;But why in the bathroom?&quot; asked Godai dumbly before he 
focused his gaze on Ranma. Narrowing his eyes at the elfin girl. 
&quot;Saotome-san. What are you up to?&quot;

	&quot;Who? Me?&quot; asked Ranma as she wore an all too innocent 
expression. &quot;I&#39;m not up to anything, Sensei.&quot;

	Looking wary, Kodachi pressed a hand to her forehead and 
murmured, &quot;Here it comes.&quot;

	Moments later, Ranma was untouched and forming a wide 
smile she leapt up and down as she cried, &quot;Ha ha! I win this round, 
amulet! I win, I win!&quot;

	&quot;Darling,&quot; began Kodachi. &quot;Please, don&#39;t--&quot;

	Kodachi got cut off as Ranma got struck by lightning for the 
eighty-seventh time.

	&quot;Saotome-san,&quot; said Godai as he leaned over his desk to look 
at Ranma&#39;s crumpled form on the floor. &quot;Do you want to go and see 
Nurse Mei now?&quot;

	&quot;Nah,&quot; Ranma croaked from where she remained crumpled on 
the floor. &quot;I&#39;ll be fine in a minute, Sensei.&quot;

	&quot;Somehow Shampoo doubting that.&quot;

	All eyes turned to see Shampoo as she walked into the 
classroom and then smiled at Godai. &quot;Sorry for be late, Sensei,&quot; 
she began. &quot;But I had to help Tachi change.&quot;

	&quot;So I heard,&quot; Godai said nervously. Giving a slight cough he 
looked back at his roll call list and then scanned the room before 
he asked, &quot;Where&#39;s Ryoga?&quot;

	&quot;Probably lost again,&quot; said Ranma with a groan. She moved 
into a sitting position on the floor. &quot;But if my dopey brother 
has any sorta luck Nabchan should be with him. And she&#39;ll be able 
to get them home, no problem.&quot;

	&quot;Okay,&quot; said Godai while he scratched the back of his head. 
He looked to Shampoo and said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Shampoo. But you know 
the penalty for being late.&quot;

	&quot;Go stand in hall, Shampoo know,&quot; said Shampoo before she 
gave a bright smile. &quot;No worries, Sensei. It worth being late for 
class to help Tachi change in bathroom.&quot;

	With that, Shampoo skipped out of the room while the few 
girls that were in the classroom had their eyes as wide as they 
could get on hearing Shampoo&#39;s statement.

	Coughing again, Godai said, &quot;Okay... lets get back to the 
roll call, shall we?&quot; Scanning the list, he looked up and noted 
that most of his male students were missing. &quot;That&#39;s weird,&quot; he 
said to himself. &quot;I could&#39;ve sworn I saw them most of them 
standing outside before.&quot;

	Looking at his half-empty class, Godai said, &quot;Akane&#39;s gone 
too. What in the heck is going on with all of my students today?&quot;

	Shrugging his shoulders and heaving a sigh, Godai did the 
only that he could do. He marked them all as absent and 
rescheduled his teaching plans for tomorrow as he was sure that 
the hour would be occupied by more wild absentee explanations yet 
again.

	It was just one of the prices that Godai had to pay for 
being a good teacher at Furinkan High.

------------------------------------------------

	Dr. Fuyuki Umi was having a bad day.

	It was something that seemed to happen each time she agreed 
to work in the Emergency Ward at work. Studying the mummified boy 
in front of her, Umi had to wonder just how she was supposed to 
find out what happened to him.

	&quot;Honestly,&quot; said Umi as she sighed again. &quot;I&#39;m not a police 
officer. Why should I be asking these questions?&quot;

	Shaking her head, Umi approached the boy and asked, &quot;Is 
your name Mosu Shiro?&quot;

	At this question, the mummified boy merely blinked.

	&quot;Oh boy,&quot; Umi heaved yet another sigh. &quot;This is going to be 
a hard one. All right,&quot; she said. &quot;Blink once for yes and blink 
twice for no. Do you understand?&quot;

	The mummified boy blinked once.

	&quot;Good,&quot; said Umi. &quot;All right. Are you Mosu Shiro?&quot;

	The mummified boy blinked once again.

	&quot;Okay, nice to meet you Shiro,&quot; said Umi. &quot;Now, can you tell 
me... uhmm, no. That will never work. How did you... no. You can&#39;t 
answer that either. What exactly... jeez.&quot; Releasing a low 
muttering cuss, Umi looked up to give Shiro an overly bright smile 
as she said, &quot;I&#39;ll see you later, Shiro.&quot;

	Shiro blinked twice at this.

	Laughing slightly, Umi said, &quot;Don&#39;t be a pessimist. You&#39;ll 
be fine once those bones heal.&quot;

	With that, Umi backed slowly away from the boy and decided 
to see one of the less serious cases. Looking at the clipboard, 
she approached the bed occupied by the boy who had been 
complaining about his ovaries.

	&quot;Kofuka Yoshi?&quot; asked Umi as she came to a halt.

	&quot;That&#39;s me,&quot; said Yoshi with a stupid grin.

	&quot;So, your ovaries feeling all better?&quot; Umi asked.

	Giving a sheepish laugh, Yoshi said, &quot;Yeah. The last doctor 
explained to me about that.&quot; He paused to hold up his arm that 
was in a cast and said, &quot;But I broke my arm. See?&quot;

	&quot;Yes, I see,&quot; murmured Umi as she focused her eyes back on 
the clipboard. &quot;I was wondering if I could ask you some questions? 
The hospital is curious why so many students from the same school 
came in here in such bad shape.&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s because of Shampoo,&quot; said Yoshi before he gave a 
shudder and hugged his good arm to himself.

	&quot;Shampoo?&quot; repeated Umi blankly. &quot;What does a hair care 
product have to do with all of your extensive injuries?&quot;

	&quot;No,&quot; Yoshi shook his head quickly. &quot;Shampoo is a girl, not 
a hair care product. A really scary girl.&quot;

	&quot;Let me guess,&quot; said Umi dryly. &quot;She&#39;s from China?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Yoshi in amazement. &quot;How did you know that? 
Are you a psychic friend or something?&quot;

	Heaving another sigh, Umi tried to hold back the migraine 
that was coming on and said, &quot;No. I&#39;m a Doctor. So this Shampoo 
person beat all of you up then?&quot;

	&quot;Beat us up?&quot; Yoshi said incredulously. &quot;She thrashed us. 
She destroyed us. She massacred us. She--&quot;

	&quot;I get the point,&quot; Umi interrupted.

	&quot;Sorry,&quot; said Yoshi with an embarrassed smile. &quot;But Shampoo 
was just so...&quot; He paused to shudder. &quot;At first the fight was 
going our way. We were so sure that we&#39;d be able to beat her up 
but then she put that chicken on her head--&quot;

	&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; interrupted Umi again. &quot;You mean to say 
that all of you attacked this Shampoo person first?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; Yoshi said as he formed a nonplused expression. 
&quot;Why? Is that a problem or something?&quot;

	Taking a moment to calm herself down, Umi said in slow 
enunciation, &quot;Why did you attack her?&quot;

	&quot;To make her happy of course,&quot; Yoshi replied before he gave 
another stupid grin. &quot;And to get a date with her.&quot;

	&quot;Get a date...?&quot; Umi echoed.

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Yoshi. &quot;Grocery Bag told us that the only way 
to make Shampoo happy was to beat her up so she&#39;d be able to go 
on a date with whoever did it.&quot;

	&quot;Grocery Bag?&quot; asked Umi. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me, that&#39;s yet another 
person from China am I correct?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Yoshi with a grin. &quot;Are you sure that you&#39;re 
not a psychic friend?&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Umi said sardonically. &quot;So that&#39;s what happened 
to all of you? This Shampoo person beat you each and every one of 
you up after you attacked her first?&quot;

	&quot;I told you she was scary,&quot; Yoshi said in response.

	Closing her eyes as she fought back the migraine that was 
swiftly taking over her brain, Umi opened her eyes then said, 
&quot;And may I ask what school you go to?&quot;

	&quot;Furinkan High,&quot; replied Yoshi easily.

	Not responding to this, Umi turned on her heel and as she 
walked away she said to herself, &quot;It figures.&quot;

	Tucking the clipboard under her arm, Umi headed towards the 
nearest phone to call Furinkan High and tell them that another 
group of their students occupied the Emergency Ward and this time 
Akane and her attempts at cooking couldn&#39;t be held responsible.

	But a girl named Shampoo could.

	Well, at least partially. Apparently they did attack Shampoo 
first and in Umi&#39;s mind that put some of the blame onto the 
injured students now residing in the hospital.

	The only thing that she couldn&#39;t understand was the concept 
of beating someone up in order to get a date.

	Shaking her head, Umi muttered, &quot;Only in Nerima.&quot;

------------------------------------------------

	&quot;Goodness,&quot; said Kasumi with a sigh. &quot;You really do seem to 
get hurt quite often when in your cursed form.&quot;

	The eldest Tendo sister was tenderly placing a bandage on 
her Amazon iinazuke while Perfume sat perfectly still as she 
astutely observed Kasumi&#39;s actions.

	&quot;Am thinking is part of curse,&quot; Perfume grumbled. She 
looked up to meet Kasumi&#39;s eyes as the other woman put a bandage 
on her nose, which was pretty scratched up.

	&quot;Still,&quot; Kasumi mused as she gently spread the medicine over 
another scratch on Perfume&#39;s hand. &quot;It&#39;s surprising that your 
injuries aren&#39;t more extensive when you change back into your 
human form. Do you suppose your pixie form might be stronger 
than you think?&quot;

	&quot;Is possible,&quot; said Perfume while she considered the theory. 
&quot;You is right about not having too bad injuries when changing 
back. Is very strange now that I think on it.&quot;

	&quot;We should ask your Great Grandmother about it,&quot; Kasumi 
said as she placed a bandage on Perfume&#39;s hand.

	&quot;Good idea,&quot; replied Perfume who was still thinking about 
the mystery that Kasumi had just brought to light.

	&quot;There,&quot; said Kasumi gently. She then gave a smile that 
could only be described as angelic. &quot;All done. Do you feel any 
better?&quot;

	&quot;Yes,&quot; said Perfume quietly before she returned the smile. 
She wryly rubbed her nose then said, &quot;I feeling much better. You 
is very good at healing, Airen.&quot;

	&quot;Well, I wouldn&#39;t call it that,&quot; murmured Kasumi. She 
turned then began placing the spare bandages and medicine back 
inside of the small emergency box she kept in the house. &quot;It was 
just bandaging some minor wounds, that&#39;s all.&quot;

	&quot;Maybe,&quot; Perfume said as an idea slowly came into her mind. 
&quot;You is very skilled at it. Am thinking that you can be a very 
great healer if you want, Airen.&quot;

	&quot;Do you really think so?&quot; Kasumi blushed a light rosy hue 
and had an almost blissful aura surrounding her. &quot;I always liked 
playing doctor when I was little and when I was in high school 
science was my favorite subject. There was even a time when I 
considered becoming a doctor.&quot; Kasumi paused and her face formed 
its all too familiar unreadable mask as she said, &quot;But then...&quot;

	&quot;But then?&quot; prompted Perfume who wore a face of concern at 
her Airen&#39;s emotional status.

	&quot;But then Mother died,&quot; said Kasumi in the barest of 
whispers. &quot;And I had to take care of the family for her. It was 
my duty as the eldest to run the house and care for everyone. But 
in the process I forgot about...&quot; Kasumi trailed off as she found 
herself unable to even say the words.

	&quot;You forgot about yourself and your own wants and needs,&quot; 
Perfume finished for her.

	Lifting her head to look into Perfume&#39;s sapphire eyes, 
Kasumi said softly, &quot;Yes. I forgot all about them.&quot;

	&quot;You no have to forget about them, Airen,&quot; said Perfume in 
soft and loving tones. &quot;I can help you achieve dreams of past. I 
can help you become a healer.&quot;

	&quot;But how?&quot; asked Kasumi in mystified tones. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but 
I doubt that you have the sort of money to pay for the costs of 
medical school, Perfume.&quot;

	Perfume gave a jaunty smirk, then said, &quot;Who say anything 
about medical school? I talking about you becoming an Amazon 
Healer. I can ask tribe to have you trained and you learn many 
ancients secrets of healing from Elder.&quot;

	&quot;Me? An Amazon Healer?&quot; Kasumi asked in dim amazement 
while she nevertheless considered the idea.

	&quot;Why not?&quot; Perfume tilted her head to one side. &quot;You would 
make good healer, Airen. You have a gentle spirit and the want to 
be a healer deep in your heart. It also a good way to learn more 
about tribe while achieving dream of becoming a skilled healer who 
help others. Is good idea, yes?&quot;

	&quot;I have enjoyed reading all of the books about your tribe 
and its customs,&quot; murmured Kasumi thoughtfully. &quot;And it does make 
sense in many ways...&quot;

	&quot;So what Airen say?&quot; asked Perfume hesitantly.

	Looking at Perfume&#39;s lovely features, Kasumi gently reached 
out to hold the Amazon&#39;s hand in her own. &quot;I say yes. I think 
it&#39;s a wonderful idea.&quot; She unlaced her fingers from Perfume&#39;s 
and cupped the other girl&#39;s cheek before she said, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

	&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; replied Perfume as she beamed.

	Several moments passed while the two sat quietly holding 
hands before Kasumi finally said, &quot;Shall we go and see your Great 
Grandmother about the details now, Perfume?&quot;

	Perfume reluctantly nodded her agreement as she didn&#39;t want 
to lose this slight contact with her Airen but to her surprise 
Kasumi didn&#39;t let go of her hand when she stood up. In fact, they 
continued to hold hands during their entire walk to the empty 
building that Cologne had recently bought for financial and 
housing reasons. And more surprising, Perfume found the contact 
continuing on and off throughout the day as Kasumi held her hand 
for support as she told her plans to her father later on that day.

	Some would say that Perfume&#39;s luck notably improved 
whenever she was in her human form.

	And that&#39;s a justified statement, wouldn&#39;t you agree?

-----------------------------------------------

	Akane was thinking.

	It was something that many people assumed she didn&#39;t do very 
much of and usually they could be considered correct in that 
particular assumption.

	Usually, but not today, and not right now.

	Because right now she had a mystery that she had to solve 
and she was in her second favorite thinking place. The brand new 
baseball field for Furinkan High. Akane loved the smell of the 
freshly cut grass and how it looked against the blue of the sky. 
Something about the place just relaxed her and made it easier for 
her to think.

	Heaving a quiet sigh, Akane looked at the baseball field and 
murmured, &quot;Why did I do it?&quot;

	Leaning back to look up at the sky, Akane said, &quot;I&#39;ve never 
joined a club of any kind before. It&#39;s always been sports teams, 
that&#39;s all.&quot;

	The fact that she&#39;d just joined the self proclaimed 
Chocoholics was bothering Akane. She never thought herself to be 
one to join the sort of club that had the type of people that 
were usually her fans. In fact, Akane had never been on the 
other side of the fence.

	Akane was always the idol and never the fan.

	Needless to say, it was strange for Akane to have things 
turned around all because of a simple... a simple...

	Oh, what was it? What was this feeling that she had for 
the girl named Chocolate? Was it just a simple crush or 
something more than that? It didn&#39;t seem like a crush because 
Akane had them before and they were never this strong.

	&quot;It&#39;s strange,&quot; Akane murmured as she watched a flock of 
birds passing by. &quot;But I can&#39;t get her out of my mind.&quot;

	&quot;Akane!&quot;

	Blinking at this, Akane pushed herself up to look at the 
approaching figure of Coach Satsuma Noboru who wore an anxious 
expression as he neared her.

	&quot;Akane,&quot; repeated Coach Satsuma while he leaned down to 
get a better look at her features. &quot;I figured that I&#39;d find you 
here. What&#39;s wrong? Why aren&#39;t you in class?&quot;

	&quot;Coach,&quot; said Akane slowly. She sighed then ducked her eyes 
to look at the floor to the bleachers.

	Looking bewildered, Coach Satsuma sat next to his star 
player for the Furinkan High girls basketball, softball, soccer, 
volleyball, track, and diving teams. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; he asked.

	&quot;Have you ever really liked someone without knowing why?&quot; 
Akane asked as she stared up at the sky again.

	&quot;Huh?&quot; Coach Satsuma asked blankly. He paused to think on 
this before he smiled and said, &quot;You bet. When I first met my 
wife, Machi, I had no idea why she liked me but--&quot;

	&quot;No,&quot; interrupted Akane softly. &quot;I meant have you ever 
liked someone and not even know why? At first you think it&#39;s 
because they&#39;re pretty but it&#39;s more than that. There&#39;s something 
about them that just sucks you in. You feel like you&#39;re in love 
but you don&#39;t know why you feel that way and it&#39;s like you&#39;re 
going crazy.&quot;

	Contemplating this, Coach Satsuma looked at her and said, 
&quot;Can&#39;t said I have. Why? Have you ever felt that way?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, I feel that way right now,&quot; said Akane while she 
gave another sigh. &quot;And it feels really weird, Coach. I just 
only met this person but I think about them all of the time.&quot; 
She looked up at him with wide eyes as she exclaimed, &quot;I don&#39;t 
even know anything about her! Just her name!&quot;

	&quot;Was it a name you recognized?&quot; Coach Satsuma asked as his 
face neared Akane&#39;s and he wore an expression of slight panic. 
&quot;Like one of the players from a rival team?&quot;

	&quot;Uhmm... no,&quot; Akane said as she looked at her Coach rather 
strangely. &quot;She&#39;s not even from Japan. She&#39;s Chinese.&quot;

	&quot;Thank the Kami,&quot; muttered Coach Satsuma under his breath 
before he looked at Akane and smiled. &quot;Well,&quot; he said while 
rising to his feet. &quot;I can&#39;t let my star player brood. And I&#39;ve 
got the perfect solution to fix this entire situation, Akane.&quot;

	&quot;Really, Coach?&quot; asked Akane with bright eyes that were 
shining with gratitude. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;ll send you to the school psychiatrist, Dr. Akihito! 
He&#39;ll be able to fix all of your problems!&quot; exclaimed Coach 
Satsuma before he started laughing heartily.

	Blinking at this, Akane gave a wary smile as she rubbed the 
back of her head and said, &quot;Dr. Akihito?&quot;

	&quot;Yes, he&#39;ll fix you right up!&quot; said Coach Satsuma while 
he whipped out a notepad and began writing. &quot;I&#39;ll just excuse 
you from your classes while you go to his office and talk out 
all of your love problems with him.&quot;

	&quot;But Coach,&quot; said Akane slowly. &quot;I don&#39;t need to see him. I 
don&#39;t want to talk about--&quot;

	&quot;Now, Akane!&quot; Coach Satsuma interrupted. &quot;You must 
remember the code of the athlete is to always be in tip top 
condition. That means mentally as well as physically. Now,&quot; he 
paused to rip off the note he&#39;d been writing and handed it to 
Akane who stared at him. &quot;You go and see the Doc.&quot;

	Staring at the note that her Coach handed her with a 
dubious expression, Akane said, &quot;If you really want me to...&quot;

	&quot;I do, I do!&quot; insisted Coach Satsuma as he turned Akane 
towards the end of the bleachers. &quot;I honestly do!&quot;

	&quot;Okay,&quot; Akane said in skeptical tones.

	Akane turned to give Coach Satsuma one last studied look 
and he offered her an overly bright smile at the attention. 
Then with a shrug, Akane took off in a cloud of dust.

	When she left, Coach Satsuma released a loud sigh and 
said in bleak tones, &quot;If Akane breaks her concentration then 
we&#39;re sure to lose the entire season. But if anyone can fix 
Akane&#39;s problems it&#39;d be him. After all, that&#39;s why everyone 
calls him the love doctor.&quot;

---------------------------------------------

	Principal Hiro Ukita looked at the note written by teacher 
Godai Yusaku and then looked at the three students standing in his 
office before he frowned.

	&quot;So... Ranma,&quot; began Principal Hiro slowly as he looked at 
the blonde elf girl in front of him. &quot;Your Sensei says that you&#39;ve 
been disrupting your class.&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s not my fault,&quot; said Ranma in stubborn tones. Her 
normally charming demeanor was gone thanks to her feelings of 
frustration over being constantly struck by lightning. &quot;The old 
ghoul gave me this lousy cursed amulet and that&#39;s what&#39;s causing 
all of the problems.&quot;

	At this statement, both Kodachi and Shampoo&#39;s eyes widened 
and they took a visible step away from Ranma.

	Observing this, Principal Hiro blinked before he focused 
back on Ranma and said, &quot;What does that piece of jewelry have to 
do with you disrupting class? And why exactly is your Sensei 
recommending that you be sent home for the day?&quot;

	Ranma was about to reply when she got a funny look on her 
sculptured features and wincing, she said, &quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot;

	&quot;What--?&quot;

	The Principal didn&#39;t get to finish his question as Ranma got 
struck by lightning for the ninety-first time.

	Wobbling from one foot to another, Ranma leaned up against 
Kodachi who instantly appeared at her side. Looking at Principal 
Hiro, Kodachi said, &quot;Now do you understand why the Sensei wishes 
to excuse Ranma dearest from classes for the rest of the day? That 
was most disruptive, was it not?&quot;

	For a reply, Principal Hiro could only dumbly nod.

	&quot;Excuse please,&quot; Shampoo said, breaking the long stretch of 
silence that passed as Principal Hiro kept his gaze locked on 
Ranma&#39;s smoking form. When the Principal slowly turned his eyes 
to her, she asked, &quot;Why Shampoo here?&quot;

	&quot;Ah, yes,&quot; Principal Hiro gave a nervous smile before he 
looked at his desk and searched through a pile of papers. &quot;I just 
received a disturbing report from Mercy on Nerima Hospital. They 
say that you attacked several of our students earlier today, many 
of which are in their emergency ward.&quot;

	Blinking at this, Shampoo said, &quot;So?&quot;

	&quot;So?&quot; echoed Principal Hiro in shock. &quot;You mean that you 
admit it? You really did attack all of those students?&quot;

	&quot;They attack Shampoo first,&quot; said Shampoo as she narrowed 
her scarlet eyes. &quot;They make mistake of challenge Shampoo in 
battle and I show them mistake of that.&quot;

	Principal Hiro merely stared at Shampoo with an expression 
of blank shock when Kodachi smoothly intervened as she said, 
&quot;Excuse me, Principal-sama, but you must realize that Shampoo is 
a foreign exchange student who hails from a most remote region of 
China. She knows nothing of our more civilized ways of conduct and 
was merely reacting in the way that she has been taught by tribal 
customs. Surely you cannot blame the ignorant for lacking 
knowledge.&quot;

	&quot;A good point Kuno-san,&quot; said Principal Hiro. He looked at 
Kodachi a moment before he sifted through his papers and reread 
the note from Godai. &quot;But may I ask why you&#39;re here? Your Sensei 
didn&#39;t mention your name in the report of Saotome-san&#39;s acts of... 
uhm... disturbance.&quot;

	&quot;Ranma dearest required someone to walk with him here and 
I&#39;m the one he trusts most,&quot; Kodachi replied. &quot;You are aware of 
his little... problem with cold water, are you not? We did our 
best to inform you of this.&quot;

	&quot;Yes, I&#39;m aware,&quot; said Principal Hiro slowly. &quot;And I thank 
you for your note, Kuno-san. It was most polite.&quot;

	&quot;It was nothing,&quot; said Kodachi with a charming smile. &quot;But 
the reason I accompanied Ranma here was because out of everyone he 
knows, he trusts me the most to aid him in his hour of need. Much 
like his curse, today&#39;s event of disturbing the class was caused 
by magic not of Ranma&#39;s control. I came to beg of you not to punish 
him for things that are beyond his control. I assume you can see 
that he cannot say this himself in his present condition.&quot;

	Looking over at the dumbfounded Ranma who was staring 
straight ahead with a vacuous expression while small curls of 
smoke rose from her head, Principal Hiro nodded.

	&quot;Very good,&quot; Principal Hiro murmured. &quot;I think that you&#39;re 
completely right, Kuno-san, and he won&#39;t be punished for today&#39;s 
events. I&#39;ll let him go with a warning and will do as your Sensei 
requested, excusing him from classes today but this problem of 
his better be cleared up and quickly. Despite rumors otherwise 
Furinkan High is a place of learning and not a place of total 
chaos.&quot;

	Wearing a sweet and complacent smile, Kodachi gave a slight 
bow as she said, &quot;Thank you ever so, Principal Hiro. I was 
wondering though... perhaps could I accompany Ranma? He isn&#39;t fit 
to exit the school grounds by himself in his current state and I 
assure you his problems will be solved much faster with me at his 
side to help care for his various troublesome woes.&quot;

	&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Principal Hiro in low tones as he gave 
Kodachi a thoughtful study. &quot;All right,&quot; he said after a long 
pause. &quot;You&#39;re excused for the day as well. But you remember what 
I said. I don&#39;t want either of you returning simply to disrupt 
classes again.&quot;

	&quot;Yes, Principal-sama,&quot; said Kodachi before she gave another 
low bow and smiled very winningly.

	&quot;Now, onto you, Shampoo-san,&quot; said Principal Hiro in solemn 
tones as he looked at the Amazon.

	Before Principal Hiro could say anything more, the door to 
his office swung open and Akane burst in wearing her usual happy 
smile as she said, &quot;Dr. Akihito, I&#39;m here!&quot;

	Akane paused on seeing the group and said, &quot;Hey. You guys 
aren&#39;t Dr. Akihito.&quot;

	&quot;Akane,&quot; said Principal Hiro in warm tones while he crossed 
around his desk to approach her. &quot;What a pleasant surprise. Is 
there anything I can do for you?&quot;

	&quot;Oh, Principal!&quot; Akane said brightly as she smiled. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, but I was looking for Dr. Akihito&#39;s office. I could have 
sworn that it was right here but I guess I was wrong.&quot;

	&quot;He&#39;s three doors down,&quot; Principal Hiro said with a smile. 
&quot;But why are you seeing him, Akane?&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m supposed to talk with him,&quot; said Akane simply.

	&quot;Ah, I see,&quot; murmured Principal Hiro thoughtfully.

	Looking around the Principal&#39;s lanky form, Akane caught 
sight of Shampoo and said, &quot;Hey, Shampoo! I was looking for you 
earlier today. I wanted to tell you that my basketball Coach 
thinks you&#39;d make a great addition to the team. She said our 
combinations yesterday had a power that she&#39;d never seen on the 
court before. So,&quot; Akane paused to give another smile. &quot;What do 
you think? Would you be at all interested in joining the team? 
It&#39;s a lot of fun, and Coach thinks that you&#39;d raise our 
standards by another ranking.&quot;

	&quot;Shampoo is joining the basketball team?&quot; asked Principal 
Hiro as he looked at Akane. &quot;And Head Coach Matsumoto said those 
things about her skill level on the court?&quot;

	&quot;Sure,&quot; said Akane easily. &quot;Shampoo&#39;s a real whiz on the 
basketball court, Principal. She&#39;s almost as good as me.&quot;

	&quot;Is fun game,&quot; Shampoo said in noncommittal tones. &quot;But 
Shampoo not sure if she wanting to--&quot;

	&quot;She&#39;ll accept of course,&quot; Kodachi cut in smoothly. &quot;Shampoo 
would love to join the basketball team, Akane-chan.&quot;

	&quot;Really? Great!&quot; Akane said as she gave a small bounce and 
a clap. &quot;I&#39;ll tell Coach soon as I&#39;m done talking with the 
Doctor.&quot; She turned to head out of the office but paused in the 
doorway. &quot;His office is three doors down, right?&quot;

	&quot;Right,&quot; replied Principal Hiro with a smile.

	&quot;Thanks!&quot; said Akane in chipper tones before she took off 
in a cloud of dust, where it came from no one really knew, and 
ran three doors down the hallway.

	While this went on, Shampoo sidled up to Kodachi and hissed 
in her ear, &quot;What you doing, demon thief?&quot;

	&quot;Now, now,&quot; said Kodachi soothingly. &quot;Trust me on this my 
dear Shampoo and all will be well.&quot;

	&quot;Trust you?&quot; Shampoo scoffed. &quot;I trust a snake more.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m wounded,&quot; Kodachi murmured lowly. &quot;After all I&#39;ve done 
to help you, this is my reward.&quot;

	&quot;Help me?&quot; asked Shampoo incredulously. &quot;You--&quot;

	Shampoo didn&#39;t get to finish her statement as the Principal 
cleared his throat and said, &quot;Shampoo-san. What you did was wrong. 
Very wrong and against the rules. So for your wrongful actions you 
must be punished. Therefore you are suspended for one day and will 
have to miss basketball practice tomorrow.  And when you return to 
school Wednesday you&#39;ll be a more responsible student and athlete, 
won&#39;t you?&quot;

	&quot;She certainly will, Principal Hiro,&quot; Kodachi said in easy 
and charming tones. She then turned to Shampoo who looked stunned 
and giving her a nudge, Kodachi said, &quot;Isn&#39;t that right, Shampoo 
dearest?&quot;

	&quot;Y-Yes,&quot; stammered Shampoo in disbelief. &quot;That right. 
Shampoo be ready to be good student.&quot;

	&quot;Good, very good,&quot; said Principal Hiro with a chuckle as he 
crossed to sit down at his desk. &quot;You&#39;re all excused.&quot;

	Kodachi and Shampoo nodded at this while Ranma remained 
frozen before Kodachi pushed on her back to lead the blonde out of 
the room. Shampoo was almost out the door when Principal Hiro 
called out, &quot;Shampoo-san!&quot;

	&quot;Yes, Principal?&quot; asked Shampoo, looking at him.

	&quot;Do me a favor,&quot; began the Principal humorously. &quot;And go 
easy on your over zealous fans next time. Take a tip from Akane 
and just ignore them, okay? This is Furinkan and trust me when I 
say that eventually the students either calm down, grow up, or 
get transferred away in the end.&quot;

	&quot;Yes, Principal,&quot; Shampoo said with a smile.

	Watching as the door closed with Shampoo&#39;s exit, Principal 
Hiro leaned back in his chair and looking up at the ceiling he 
murmured, &quot;Whoever said that high school was boring sure as hell 
never lived in Nerima.&quot;

	And oddly enough, deep down Principal Hiro was somewhat 
proud of the truth in that statement.

	Educators, the original rebels.

---

	Looking around the cafeteria, Tatewaki wondered just why 
everyone was staring right at him.

	He also wondered where everyone else was. Ryoga he could 
understand. It was very likely that he was lost yet again with his 
iinazuke, Nabiki, for company. But that didn&#39;t explain where 
Kodachi, Ranma, and Shampoo were.

	&quot;Where did everyone go?&quot; Tatewaki murmured to himself 
while he paused with his lunch tray to study his rather crowded 
surroundings that didn&#39;t have one face he was familiar with.

	Tatewaki was about to resign himself to eating outside 
underneath one of the large trees in the yard, when two boys 
appeared at his side wearing large smiles.

	&quot;Hey, you&#39;re Kuno Tatewaki, right?&quot; the first boy asked as 
he offered a strange smile.

	&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; replied Tatewaki. &quot;And you are?&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m Hiroshi,&quot; the first boy introduced himself. &quot;And this 
is Daisuke. We just wanted to ask you something then we promise to 
get out of your hair, Sempai.&quot;

	&quot;Ask me something?&quot; echoed Tatewaki as he blinked in 
confusion. &quot;But what do you want to ask?&quot;

	&quot;Did you really do... y&#39;know, with Shampoo in the bathroom?&quot; 
Daisuke asked with a slight leer.

	&quot;You know?&quot; Tatewaki repeated slowly.

	&quot;Yeah, you know,&quot; Daisuke continued. &quot;We heard all the 
rumors about you &#39;changing&#39; with her in the bathroom and they&#39;re 
pretty wild. We wanted to get the real deal from you before all 
the bets start getting placed by the duo.&quot;

	&quot;The duo?&quot; Tatewaki said as he seemed unable to do anything 
other than repeat words and turn red faced.

	&quot;Yeah, Ranma and Kodachi,&quot; said Hiroshi. &quot;That&#39;s what 
everyone calls them. The dynamic duo. They&#39;re always up on the 
latest bets, gossip, and scams around here.&quot;

	&quot;Ranma,&quot; seethed Tatewaki in low tones. &quot;He was the one 
spreading such lies about myself and Shampoo?&quot;

	&quot;Uhmm, well actually,&quot; began Hiroshi hesitantly. &quot;It was 
more Shampoo&#39;s doing than Ranma&#39;s. But he was there.&quot;

	Unfortunately for Hiroshi and mostly for Ranma, Tatewaki 
had reverted back to his most simplistic state of mind. It was 
a state of mind that his sister knew all too well.

	It was the state of mind where Tatewaki heard only what he 
wanted to hear and interpreted it in only the way that he wanted 
to interpret it.

	So knowing this, it&#39;s safe to say that Tatewaki didn&#39;t take 
Hiroshi&#39;s words in the exact way that he meant them.

	&quot;Saotome!&quot; shouted Tatewaki as he threw his lunch tray into 
the air, not really noticing when it landed on a nearby student, 
and produced his katana. &quot;You shall pay for sullying my and 
Shampoo&#39;s good names with these base lies! Kuno Tatewaki is saving 
himself for the holy bonds of matrimony!&quot;

	With that, Tatewaki rushed out of the cafeteria leaving all 
of the students in it in complete and utter shock.

	&quot;Well,&quot; Hiroshi said after a long moment of utter silence. 
&quot;That was really weird.&quot;

	&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Daisuke nodded. &quot;Definitely weird.&quot;

	Looking at his friend, Hiroshi said, &quot;Want to make bets with 
Nabiki&#39;s crew on whether Ranma survives?&quot;

	&quot;I take seven to one odds,&quot; said Daisuke before they rushed 
off towards the nearest bookie.

	And with that, life went back to normal at the busy Furinkan 
High cafeteria.

	Or as normal as anything could get at Furinkan High.

---

	&quot;Shampoo not understand,&quot; said Shampoo as they made their 
way to the building her Great Grandmother had bought and Shampoo 
knew that she&#39;d be in. &quot;Why you help with making punishment for 
Shampoo lighter?&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s very simple,&quot; Ranma drawled before she shot Shampoo a 
rakish smile. &quot;It was convenient and it helped our cause just 
like my pretending to be catatonic helped to get my lovely Dachi 
out of class for the day. Right, sweetie pie?&quot;

	&quot;Right, my darling,&quot; Kodachi purred as she hooked her arm 
in Ranma&#39;s and leaned against the taller girl. She then looked to 
Shampoo and explained, &quot;We&#39;re aware of the bonds of honor your 
tribe holds. We helped you and in exchange for that we ask that 
you help us by answering a trifling question.&quot;

	Her scarlet eyes narrowing, Shampoo said, &quot;That all you 
want? Just for Shampoo to answer question?&quot;

	&quot;Exactly,&quot; said Ranma with her usual charm.

	Wearing a small frown, Shampoo conceded, &quot;All right. 
Shampoo answer your question. What is it?&quot;

	&quot;How do we get your Great Grandmother to remove this 
amulet from Ranma darling&#39;s neck?&quot; asked Kodachi.

	&quot;And why the hell is it zapping me so much?&quot; Ranma added as 
she grumbled along with her question.

	&quot;That two questions,&quot; Shampoo pointed out.

	&quot;Ah, but one each,&quot; said Kodachi slyly.

	Shaking her head at this, Shampoo said, &quot;Should have known 
you be too tricky on this.&quot; Taking a pause, she wore a thoughtful 
expression before she said, &quot;First question not so easy. Great 
Grandmother have plan of some type and best way to find out is to
be asking her. That all I can figure.&quot;

	&quot;And my question?&quot; demanded Ranma.

	&quot;That all too simple,&quot; said Shampoo as she gave Ranma a 
mischievous smile. &quot;Great Grandmother program amulet to punish 
demon thief so he be wanting to give into whatever plan she has by 
the time she reveal it to him. Is like electrical version of 
Chinese Water Torture, yes? Now you understand amulet&#39;s purpose?&quot;

	&quot;That sucks,&quot; Ranma muttered lowly.

	&quot;Can say that, yes,&quot; Shampoo replied while she wore the same 
mischievous smile. Looking at Ranma and Kodachi she contemplated 
the couple before she turned to look ahead and then said, &quot;It seem 
that someone here besides us.&quot;

	&quot;Huh?&quot; Ranma shifted her focus to look at the building that 
she knew to be owned by Cologne only to find the front doors open 
and hear the sound of conversation.

	Taking the initiative, as usual, Kodachi grabbed Ranma&#39;s 
hand in her own and tugged the tall blonde after her as she strode 
towards the entrance to the building. 

	Pausing in the doorway, Kodachi took in the sight before her 
and could only say one thing about it.

	&quot;Nani?&quot;

	Hearing Kodachi&#39;s voice, Kasumi looked up from enjoying her 
quiet lunch with Cologne and Perfume, which to Kodachi looked like 
a strange Amazon version of a Norman Rockwell painting. From 
behind Kodachi, both Ranma and Shampoo could be seen peeking 
over her shoulder. 
	
	 &quot;Well, well,&quot; Cologne pronounced as she looked at the 
figures of Ranma and Kodachi. &quot;Skipping school so you can see me, 
are you? Is my little trinket giving you trouble?&quot;

	&quot;Old ghoul,&quot; growled Ranma who stepped around Kodachi 
and stalked towards Cologne and the table she sat at with Kasumi 
and Perfume. &quot;Tell me what you&#39;ve done to me by giving me this 
damn hunk of jewelry.&quot;

	&quot;And tell us how we might somehow convince you to remove 
it or at least cease the attacks on Ranma&#39;s person,&quot; added Kodachi 
as she took a step forward to stand next to her elfin girlfriend.

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ranma said roughly. &quot;That too.&quot;

	Clucking her tongue, Cologne gave a soft chuckle before she 
said, &quot;Even with Shampoo and Perfume to aid you and Kasumi&#39;s 
newfound knowledge on our history and laws you still don&#39;t know 
what&#39;s going on yet? I&#39;m disappointed.&quot;

	&quot;So correct that,&quot; Kodachi murmured as her eyes flashed a 
dangerous light. &quot;And tell us your true purpose.&quot;

	&quot;Cleverly played, Kuno-san,&quot; said Cologne. She paused to 
hop forward on her staff and studying the couple closely she said, 
&quot;The amulet is a test of both character and power. Ranma will 
continue to wear it for as long as I deem necessary but for now I 
will remove the command that has the lightning strikes set up as 
punishment for him.&quot;

	Ranma scowled at the mention of lightning but Kodachi 
stopped her from saying anything by touching her arm lightly as 
she smiled at Cologne then said, &quot;We give you our thanks for 
leniency in this area but what do you want? What is behind giving 
Ranma dearest this magical amulet?&quot;

	&quot;Try returning our treasures,&quot; Perfume&#39;s blunt but somehow 
melodic voice cut into the conversation. Kodachi and Ranma looked 
her way and when they did, the Amazon Enforcer smirked then said, 
&quot;Or you think we forget that you still no return them? You return 
them or I&#39;m thinking you see full force of slave amulet&#39;s power.&quot;

	&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; asked Ranma in disbelief. &quot;You made me go 
through all of this just for some stupid jewels?!&quot;

	Kodachi moved away from Ranma and waited for him to get 
struck by lightning for the ninety-second time.

	Nothing happened.

	Observing this action, Cologne looked at Kodachi and 
chuckled. &quot;You really have no idea, do you?&quot; she murmured.

	&quot;What do you mean?&quot; demanded Ranma sourly who was 
anxious from constantly expecting to get zapped again.

	&quot;You have no idea about the slave amulet or its powers,&quot; 
Cologne said. Shaking her head, she hopped away from the couple 
and said, &quot;Foolish children. You think that Saotome-san is being 
punished because of certain things that he says or does when that 
is hardly the case.&quot;

	&quot;Really?&quot; asked Ranma blankly.

	&quot;Then what is?&quot; Kodachi asked as she returned to Ranma&#39;s 
side, feeling that it was safe to do so now.

	&quot;The amulet is a test,&quot; Cologne repeated. &quot;I was taught it&#39;s 
far better to have a powerful ally than a powerful enemy and 
that&#39;s where you come in, Saotome-san. You have the potential to 
be powerful but you have no idea of the abilities you hold in your 
cursed form. I can teach you those abilities but I require a 
safeguard because to be honest, I don&#39;t trust either of you with 
such power as of yet.&quot;

	&quot;So this is all because you wish to train Ranma darling in 
his cursed elfin form?&quot; asked Kodachi slowly. &quot;And in this way you 
wish to form an alliance between our two groups?&quot;

	&quot;In a way, yes,&quot; murmured Cologne.

	&quot;But why use it to trap Ranma dearest in his cursed form?&quot; 
Kodachi asked in slight confusion.

	&quot;Because of the training,&quot; said Cologne. &quot;The magics we&#39;ll 
be dealing with are very powerful and it would make the training 
all that easier for him to remain in his elfin form.&quot;

	&quot;And the lightning attacks?&quot; Kodachi persisted.

	&quot;Completely random,&quot; Cologne revealed. &quot;I had the amulet 
programmed to release them at random intervals when it deemed most 
appropriate or just felt the need to do so.&quot;

	&quot;Aiyaah,&quot; Shampoo breathed. &quot;So demon thief getting struck 
by lightning for no apparent reason?&quot;

	&quot;Oh my,&quot; said Kasumi. &quot;Poor Ranma.&quot;

	Snickering at this, Perfume said, &quot;That a nice trick, Great 
Grandmother.&quot;

	There was a long moment of silence as everyone turned to 
look at the oddly mute form of Ranma who had her blonde head hung 
low as she stared at the ground.

	&quot;Heh,&quot; Ranma chuckled softly. &quot;I should&#39;ve known.&quot;

	Everyone reacted in surprise at this and not noticing the 
attention, Ranma wore a wide smirk as she proclaimed, &quot;I never did 
anything worth getting zapped for! I&#39;m Saotome Ranma and I&#39;m damn 
near being perfect!&quot;

	Watching warily as Ranma burst into impudent laughter, 
Shampoo said, &quot;Great Grandmother?&quot;

	&quot;Yes, Shampoo?&quot; asked Cologne.

	&quot;You turn off punishment for amulet yet?&quot; asked Shampoo.

	&quot;No,&quot; Cologne replied as she smiled on realizing what 
Shampoo was insinuating. &quot;Not yet.&quot;

	Then Ranma got struck by lightning for the very last time.

	Because no doubt, tomorrow the amulet would come up with 
a new and better punishment.

------------------------------------------------

	It was a slow night for cabbies.

	Or at least it was a slow night for cab driver, Nuruba Shin, 
as he parked his cab against the side curb for one of the most 
fanciest clubs in downtown Tokyo.

	Gazing at his rearview mirror, Shin muttered, &quot;Slow night, 
but no fights, that means no right to complain.&quot;

	&quot;Damn,&quot; Shin groaned after a moment. &quot;That was a lame ass 
rhyme. Now I know for sure I&#39;m bored.&quot; Leaning back in his seat 
he glanced at the crowded front entrance to the club before his 
eyes averted and he noticed something.

	Rather, he noticed someone coming out of the back alley of 
the club as if they were trying to avoid the attention of the 
people crowding the front as they tried to get in.

	His curiosity piqued, Shin moved his cab into drive and 
turned around swiftly to meet the person down the street. From the 
way they were swaying slightly from side to side it was more than 
obvious they were intoxicated and would be in need of a ride home. 
Besides that, something in Shin&#39;s gut told him that this person 
would make for an interesting ride.

	So pulling up against the curb, Shin rolled down his window 
and shouted, &quot;Hey buddy! Need a cab?&quot;

	The man paused in his swaying walk to slowly turn around and 
look at Shin with careful eyes. He paused to look at the front 
entrance to the club and Shin followed his gaze to see the crowd 
of people in the exact same position as before. What was the man 
looking at?

	Shin was brought out of his musings by the slam of the car 
door and he looked into his rearview mirror to see that the man 
was now sitting in his backseat.

	&quot;Where to, buddy?&quot; asked Shin amiably.

	At this question, the man muttered something unintelligible 
but before Shin could ask him to repeat what he said the man 
leaned forward to hand Shin a small business card that had an 
address neatly pressed on it in gold lettering. 

	Stuffing the card into his pocket, Shin gave a short shrug 
then started the cab up again and headed towards the address that 
he recognized to be in a particularly ritzy part of Tokyo where 
only the most elite of the rich lived.

	After awhile, Shin got curious about his passenger and 
looked back into his mirror and studied the handsome features of 
the man. He looked to be in his late teens or early twenties and 
had his brown hair pulled back in a ponytail but what really caught 
Shin&#39;s attention was the black Armani suit that the man wore like 
second skin.

	Shin was still studying the man when his passenger opened 
his eyes and looked into the mirror as if he knew just what Shin 
was thinking as he looked at him.

	And that&#39;s when Shin recognized the man.

	&quot;Holy shit,&quot; breathed Shin in shock. &quot;It&#39;s you! It&#39;s really 
you! What&#39;re you doing in my cab?! I mean, shit. I just never 
thought I&#39;d be giving you a ride. You&#39;re a big movie star and I&#39;m 
just a cabby trying to earn a buck--&quot;

	&quot;Stop the cab,&quot; the man said.

	&quot;What?&quot; Shin blinked. &quot;Am I wrong? Aren&#39;t you--?&quot;

	&quot;My penthouse,&quot; said the man calmly. &quot;It&#39;s right here. Stop 
the cab, I want to get out.&quot;

	Despite his slurred tones, Shin could tell the man was 
deadly serious and a force to be reckoned with so he instantly 
stopped the cab and watched as the man fumbled through the folds 
of his pockets to his suit jacket.

	&quot;That&#39;s okay,&quot; Shin began. &quot;If you&#39;re who I think you are 
then the ride is free. I&#39;m one of your biggest fans, man.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m me all right,&quot; said the man roughly. He paused to pull 
out a large wad of cash and handed it Shin. &quot;Keep the change and 
have a very merry Christmas.&quot;

	&quot;Christmas?&quot; Shin echoed before he looked down at the wad 
of cash and counted it. &quot;Six hundred thousand yen?!&quot;

	Sticking his head out of his cab window, Shin called to the 
man&#39;s back, &quot;I dunno if you are who I think you are but thanks 
anyway, buddy! You&#39;re the best passenger ever!&quot;

	Entering his building, the man chuckled softly as he got 
onto the elevator and slumped back against the wall as he went 
through the usual long wait to his penthouse that was on the very 
top floor to the extremely plush apartment building.

	Swaying as he went down the hallway, the man fumbled with 
his new age key card that his advisors had recently added to his 
penthouse for security reasons then entered his darkened home.

	&quot;Lights,&quot; said the man wearily as the lights turned on. He 
then made his way into his bedroom and flopped down on his king 
sized bed and stared up at his marble ceiling that seemed very 
shiny.

	After a long moment of complete silence, the man draped an 
arm over his eyes and said, &quot;I hate my life.&quot;

	&quot;But why would you hate life? Life is wonderful!&quot;

	The man blinked at the sound of an overly cheerful voice 
and removed his arm from his eyes and screamed when he saw half 
a dozen miniature women who were barely four inches high in 
height standing in front of him on his bed.

	&quot;Well,&quot; one of the miniature women said. &quot;That&#39;s no way to 
react. Especially after we traveled so far to come and help you.&quot;

	&quot;What the hell are you?!&quot; the man demanded as he backed 
away from the miniature women and into his wall.

	&quot;Who are we? We are here to set you free!&quot;

	&quot;Oh no, not the rhyming again.&quot;

	&quot;I do hate rhyming, it&#39;s so bothersome.&quot;

	&quot;Shhhhh! We have to rhyme! It&#39;s part of the deal!&quot;

	Narrowing his eyes, the man crouched down to study the 
bickering miniature women and said, &quot;This has gotta be a weird 
side effect from all of those vodka shooters.&quot;

	&quot;Ahem!&quot; one of the miniature women coughed, the one he 
assumed was the leader because she was in front. &quot;We are here to 
solve your every woe and to help you defeat the darkest of foes. 
We are those light of heart and full of smarts.&quot;

	&quot;No kidding?&quot; the man asked slowly.

	&quot;We are the okonomiyaki elves and we are here to help you 
Kuonji Ukyo!&quot; the miniature woman declared.

	&quot;I thought we were calling ourselves the spatula sprites 
from now on,&quot; another miniature woman griped.

	&quot;I like okonomiyaki elves, it&#39;s more traditional.&quot;

	&quot;But spatula sprites sounds so much more kawaii!&quot;

	&quot;No, it sounds like a stupid tongue twister.&quot;

	A dumbfounded and drunk Ukyo watched as the miniature 
women who were either called okonomiyaki elves or spatula sprites 
proceeded to get into a massive brawl on top of his bed. Squinting 
at this, Ukyo rubbed his forehead and muttered, &quot;I definitely had 
one too many vodka shooters.&quot;
