Juri knocked, then boldly opened the door of the Tokyo apartment. 
&#39;What in the world?&#39; she found herself wondering, looking around at 
the small crowd gathered there. The entire Ohtori student council 
waited in there for whatever mysterious announcement Utena and Anthy 
had said they were going to make.

&quot;Juri-sempai!&quot; Miki Kaoru smiled at her happily. He got up out of his 
chair to bound over to her side. Juri managed to stop a hug, and 
instead shook his hand firmly.

&quot;Good to see you, Miki,&quot; Juri smiled at the blue hared boy. He had 
matured a bit, over the years, but he still looked like the thin 
pianist she once knew.

&quot;C&#39;mon, I&#39;ll introduce you to my girlfriend,&quot; Miki smiled, tugging at 
her hand.

&quot;Girlfriend?&quot; Juri echoed him, slightly surprised. She was even more 
surprised to see who it actually was.

Nanami Kiryuu smiled at her honestly, &quot;How have you been, Juri?&quot; The 
blonde&#39;s hair was only shoulder length, but the biggest difference was 
in her eyes. A easy confidence shown forth, a self knowledge she had 
once lacked.

&quot;Things are going well for me,&quot; Juri smiled. It was obvious that they 
were happy together, so with a smile she asked, &quot;How long have you 
been together?&quot;

&quot;About a year,&quot; Miki smiled. He gazed fondly at Nanami, &quot;A company I 
was recording at is a subsidiary of Kiryuu communications, and I ran 
into Nanami there.&quot;

&quot;More like I tracked him down,&quot; Nanami chuckled. &quot;We got together to 
talk and we just seemed to click,&quot; she shrugged.

The two looked into their eyes and seemed to become lost. Juri grinned 
and excused herself quietly to mingle a bit. Something odd struck her 
then: Touga and Saionji were standing at opposite ends of the room, 
the farthest apart they could get.

&quot;Touga,&quot; Juri greeted him quietly, as he was the closest. Up close, 
and the red hared duelist didn&#39;t look so good. His color was mostly 
from cosmetics, and his eyes were just a bit off focus.

&quot;Juri,&quot; Touga nodded. A slight smile, &quot;Are you still chasing the 
ladies?&quot;

Juri was a bit startled by the brazenness of the question, but 
answered gamely, &quot;Yes, I am. How about you?&quot;

Touga grinned, &quot;But of course.&quot; He hefted a glass of something that 
smelled quite potent and took a deep drink.

&#39;He&#39;s a bit too much into being the playboy, I think,&#39; Juri thought to 
herself a bit sadly. With as much dignity as she could muster, she 
excused herself. She looked around, and noticed Saionji looked at her 
thoughtfully.

She decided to see everyone and headed across the room toward him. 
&quot;Hello, Saionji,&quot; she smiled cautiously.

&quot;It&#39;s good to see you,&quot; Saionji smiled at her. His green hair was tied 
back, and his face showed the lines of an easy smile. The cold 
formality and anger that had been his trademarks were gone, replaced 
by a feeling of kindness.

&quot;I can&#39;t get over how much everyone&#39;s changed,&quot; she remarked quietly.

Saionji chuckled softly, &quot;Including yourself, Arisugawa?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Juri said, sounding somewhat startled.

There was a twinkle in Saionji&#39;s eye as he said, &quot;I&#39;ve seen you smile 
more in the last few minutes than the entire time I knew you in the 
student council.&quot; Still smiling, he headed off to talk with Miki and 
Nanami.

Anthy came out of the other room first, followed by Utena. Both of 
their expressions were quite grave, drawing the attention of the 
entire room. &quot;I&#39;m sorry about the cryptic letter,&quot; Utena apologized, 
&quot;but I thought I should explain in person.&quot;

&quot;Explain what, Tenjou?&quot; Touga asked disagreeably. &quot;I&#39;ve been greatly 
inconvenienced by all of this mystery,&quot; he complained.

Saionji shot him a look, &quot;Be quiet, Kiryuu.&quot; He looked up at Utena, 
&quot;Carry on, please.&quot;

&quot;We all fought in the duels,&quot; Utena started, &quot;competing for the Power 
of Dios, the power to revolutionize the world. And in the end, I was 
the victor of the duels.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s debatable,&quot; Touga muttered, only to receive a slap to the back 
of the head by Nanami. &quot;Ow!&quot; he winced.

&quot;The problem was,&quot; Utena said forcefully, &quot;that I realized the power 
was too much for one person to safely possess. Akio was corrupted, and 
there was no guarantee that I wouldn&#39;t be, either. So,&quot; she paused, 
and in a rush said, &quot;I gave some of the power to all of you.&quot;

You could have heard a pin drop after that little revelation. Miki 
recovered first, asking, &quot;So what, exactly, will this do?&quot;

&quot;We aren&#39;t entirely sure,&quot; Anthy took up the question. &quot;But the little 
power Akio retained made him nearly ageless, and I suspect that it 
could do much the same to you.&quot;



After the meeting was over, Juri walked along the street home, lost in 
her thoughts. &#39;Ageless, nearly immortal,&#39; she mused, &#39;what does that 
mean? Will all my friends grow old and die all around me?&#39; She felt a 
bit of comfort knowing Ryouko and the others, near immortals that they 
were, but it still was a disturbing thought.

A horn&#39;s honk startled her greatly, and Juri turned to see Haruka 
looking at her in concern. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Haruka asked her in 
concern. &quot;I honked at you a few times, and you didn&#39;t even notice,&quot; 
she noted. She popped open the passenger side in invitation, and after 
a moment Juri decided to climb in.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Juri smiled. &quot;I guess I just had something on my mind,&quot; she 
explained her earlier distraction. She slid into the seat like a cat, 
settling comfortably.

&quot;Anything I can do to help?&quot; Haruka offered as they pulled away from 
the curb. The sandy hared woman drove with her usual confidence, 
easily handling the powerful car.

&quot;What did it do to you, when you first became a Senshi?&quot; Juri asked 
quietly.

Haruka looked over at Juri in surprise, and saw that the woman was 
dead serious. She debated for a moment silently, then decided to 
answer her.

&quot;It shook me up some,&quot; Haruka said softly, &quot;I suddenly had a whole new 
set of options, but also many new obligations. Why do you want to 
know?&quot;

&quot;According to a fairly trustworthy friend of mine,&quot; Juri smiled 
slightly, &quot;I may be nearly ageless, possibly even immortal.&quot;

Haruka nearly swerved the car, but then recovered. &quot;You didn&#39;t receive 
a transformation wand at the time, did you?&quot; she asked wryly.

&quot;Uh, no,&quot; Juri said, blinking with surprise.

&quot;Oh, good,&quot; Haruka smiled. The idea of Juri in a sailor fuku was 
pretty scary, so she felt a bit relieved at that.

Juri suddenly got what she was driving at, and began to laugh.

Haruka used her hands free cellphone to dial home, &quot;Michiru? I&#39;m 
bringing company home for dinner. Let Hotaru and Setsuna know, all 
right?&quot;

&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Juri protested.

&quot;If you want to talk about it, Setsuna&#39;s the best expert I know,&quot; 
Haruka shrugged. &quot;And you&#39;ll get a good meal out of it, too,&quot; she 
smiled.

&quot;You&#39;re just looking for an excuse to matchmake me with Setsuna 
again,&quot; Juri grumbled softly. Haruka&#39;s best attempt at looking 
innocent didn&#39;t really help much.
