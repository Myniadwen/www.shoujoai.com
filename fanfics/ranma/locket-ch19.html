<h1>Arisugawa's Locket (part 19 of 88)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/locket-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>New Year&#39;s Eve: Part Two

&quot;The Sunlit Garden&quot; played as a duet flowed across the patrons of the 
Locket like a gentle musical wave. Kozue Kaoru smiled slightly, 
letting her fingers dance across the portable keyboard. Beside her, 
Ami Mizuno followed where she led, adding structure and skill to 
spirited playing. Finally, the song came to a close as both young 
women breathed a sigh of relief hidden by the soft round of applause 
they received.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Kozue said, smiling over at Ami in honest pleasure. Her 
blue hair was a bit longer, reaching her shoulders, and her eyes 
glowed in the dim lights.

&quot;Why did you want to do that so badly?&quot; Ami asked her quietly, her own 
boyish cut drawing a few admiring gazes.

A wry smile marked Kozue&#39;s lips as she explained, &quot;There was somebody 
I had a lot of issues around. That song became mixed up in it all, so 
I guess I just wanted to prove I could master it, even if only to 
myself.&quot;

Rei nodded thoughtfully, gently sliding her arm over Ami&#39;s shoulder. 
&quot;I can see what you mean,&quot; she said softly.

Kozue got up, smiling as she thanked them both again. &#39;Too bad they&#39;re 
a couple,&#39; she found herself thinking as she mingled with the crowd.

Nagisa looked around nervously before pushing her long blue hair back. 
She took a drink, letting the wine linger a moment in her mouth before 
swallowing it down. &quot;Are you here alone?&quot; a voice asked from behind 
her.

Nagisa turned to see a striking young woman with purple hair standing 
there. She was dressed very feminine, but there was a bit of iron in 
her gaze. Liking what she saw, Nagisa smiled, &quot;I&#39;m alone, actually.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s almost a crime,&quot; Shiori smiled, sitting down beside here. &quot;My 
name is Shiori,&quot; and she offered her hand.

&quot;Nagisa,&quot; she answered, and shook it firmly.

May fought a smile as she took orders nearby. &#39;I wonder if I should 
tell Shiori that Nagisa is a dominatrix employed by the mob?&#39; she 
wondered. She looked at the two of them and decided not too. A hand 
waved, and she made her way to a pair of newbies.

Natsumi smiled up at May from her seat, &quot;What would you recommend 
tonight?&quot;

May rattled off a few options before cheerfully finishing, &quot;And the 
house special is also very good tonight.&quot;

Natsumi and Miyuki exchanged a glance, and then Miyuki said &quot;Two of 
the house special, please.&quot;

May tucked her notebook away and bowed, &quot;Coming right up!&quot;

Two young ladies danced by the table, both dressed in skin tight 
costumes colored red and white. &quot;Wow,&quot; Natsumi murmured, watching 
bottoms sway. A slap upside the head, &quot;Ow!&quot;

Miyuki rolled her eyes, &quot;I can&#39;t believe you.&quot;

Natsumi smiled at her, &quot;I may look, but I&#39;d never stray.&quot;

Juri watched the crowd with a smile, glad to see things bustling. 
Hearing &quot;Sunlit Garden&quot; brought back a lot of memories, some good, 
some bad. She pulled out the letter she had just received and read the 
enigmatic contents yet again.

&quot;Need to meet with the duelists urgently,&quot; it read simply, a location, 
date and time was listed below, and it was signed simply, &quot;Anthy and 
Utena.&quot;

&#39;What in the world&#39;s going on?&#39; Juri wondered. She thought she knew 
Utena fairly well, and she wouldn&#39;t send a letter like this out on a 
lark. Anthy, on the other hand, was a bit more of a mystery to Juri.

&quot;You look remarkably serious,&quot; Haruka remarked. The tall blonde had 
come up beside Juri by the library, looking at her friend with a bit 
of concern.

Juri smiled slightly, putting the letter away as she remarked, &quot;Old 
business, stuff I thought I had put behind me long ago.&quot;

&quot;If you need some backup,&quot; Haruka said seriously, &quot;just let me know.&quot;

This time, Juri&#39;s smile was a bit wicked as she asked, &quot;I wonder who 
would show up, you or Sailor Uranus?&quot;

Michiru stepped up to take Haruka&#39;s arm. She smiled innocently at 
Juri, &quot;I&#39;m sure that Haruka has no idea what you&#39;re talking about.&quot; A 
little smile tugged at Michiru&#39;s lips even as she said that, though.

Juri snorted with amusement. She was fairly certain she knew who all 
the senshi were, but she didn&#39;t mind maintaining the illusion that 
their identities were a secret. Besides, she still kept a few secrets 
herself.

&quot;You&#39;re much too serious,&quot; Michiru noted. She grabbed Juri&#39;s arm even 
as Haruka grabbed the other, &quot;Come on, it&#39;s your turn to karaoke.&quot;

&quot;Oh, no!&quot; Juri protested.

&quot;One song won&#39;t kill you,&quot; Haruka smiled, helping pull Juri along.

Several other patrons noticed what was going on, and Juri got 
desperate. &quot;All right,&quot; she finally said, &quot;I promise to do karaoke 
before the night is over, OK?&quot;

Michiru and Haruka exchanged a look. &quot;Not as good as doing it now,&quot; 
Michiru noted.

&quot;But better than nothing,&quot; Haruka pointed out. Juri quickly extricated 
herself, fleeing with as much dignity as possible.

&quot;Spatula Girl good dancer,&quot; Shampoo admitted as Ukyo gently swayed her 
to the music. She was wearing a long red dress that was almost 
skintight, hugging every generous curve while her long purple hair 
bounced free.

&quot;You&#39;re not so bad yourself,&quot; Ukyo smiled down at her. The boy&#39;s 
school uniform she wore made her look quite handsome, catching many 
young ladies eye. Softly, she asked, &quot;Why did you finally decide to 
say yes to me?&quot;

Shampoo looked up at the boyish young woman, enjoying the feel of her 
arms wrapped around her. &quot;Shampoo always kind of like you,&quot; she 
admitted softly.

&quot;Juri&#39;s doing karaoke?&quot; Sasami said happily. She and Minagi were 
taking a snuggle break when the topic came up.

&quot;Why, is she good at it?&quot; Minagi asked.

&quot;Yeah, she&#39;s got a good voice,&quot; Sasami smiled happily. She looked 
thoughtful, &quot;We should make sure she doesn&#39;t forget, though.&quot;

&quot;Not a problem,&quot; Minagi chuckled, &quot;enough patrons heard that I doubt 
she&#39;ll be able to slip out of it.&quot;

Sasami grinned, &quot;I&#39;ll pass the word around the staff, just in case.&quot;

Excel and Hyatt kept laying out plates of food for the two young woman 
until they finally unloaded them all into a huge mountain in front of 
the two young women. &quot;This should do,&quot; Lina Inverse smiled, &quot;for a 
first course.&quot;

&quot;Do you have rooms to rent for the night?&quot; Naga the White Serpent 
asked. Her breasts bounced in their leather bikini when she moved, and 
Excel found her head involuntarily bobbing right along with them.

At least until Hyatt jabbed her in the ribs. &quot;Yes, there should still 
be a room or two left. Do you want one for a few hours, or the entire 
night?&quot; Hyatt asked.

&quot;The night, of course. Why would anyone want to rent a room for a... 
few... hours...&quot; Lina trailed off, then a blush appeared on her cheeks 
as she finally got it.

&quot;One room for the night,&quot; Excel repeated cheerfully, and bounded off.

Juri walked up to the bar, to be met with a broadly smiling Ryouko. 
&quot;So, when are you doing karaoke, boss?&quot; she asked her.

Juri looked at her in surprise, then groaned softly. &quot;How many of the 
others have heard about that?&quot; she asked rather desperately.

&quot;Well, Bones told Hitomi, who told Excel and Hyatt, and then they 
passed it to me,&quot; Ryouko smiled. &quot;I&#39;m not sure who told Bones, 
though,&quot; she shrugged.

&quot;I did, after Sasami told me and Nabiki,&quot; Minagi put in.

Juri looked back and forth between them before she thumped her head on 
the top of the bar, loudly. &quot;I&#39;m doomed,&quot; she said mournfully.

A young woman dressed in a scarlet magician&#39;s outfit took the stage, 
followed by another woman in a nun&#39;s habit. They exchanged sweet 
smiles, each taking a microphone.

Saint Tail started off, &quot;She came in through the bathroom window!&quot;

&quot;Protected by a silver spoon,&quot; the nun sang sweetly.

&quot;But now she&#39;s such a golden wonder,&quot; they sang the next bit together, 
&quot;by the banks of her own lagoon!&quot;

&quot;That was cute,&quot; Maya sighed softly as she slow danced with Ritsuko.

&quot;So are you,&quot; Ritsuko smiled, gently kissing the shorter brown haired 
woman. A soft chuckle, &quot;Did you see Rei and Asuka running around in 
their Eva uniforms?&quot;

&quot;I bet that turned a few heads,&quot; Maya laughed. She noticed Priss and 
Misato sitting at the bar, trying to out drink each other yet again. 
&quot;They better not get sick in the jeep again,&quot; Maya said dangerously.

Just then, Juri began to make her way nervously towards the stage. 
Setsuna quickly intercepted her, &quot;Wait a moment.&quot;

Juri flushed a bit, &quot;Hello, Setsuna. What can I do for you?&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t fair for Haruka and Michiru to push you into doing 
karaoke,&quot; Setsuna said firmly. She paused, looking away shyly, &quot;If you 
like, I&#39;ll join you up there.&quot;

Juri blushed brighter, &quot;Thank you, I&#39;d really appreciate that.&quot; Juri 
climbed up on the stage first, reaching down to help Setsuna up.

The crowd noticed Juri up on the stage, and began to quiet. The 
silence spread, and soon everyone was focused on Juri and Setsuna up 
on the stage.

&quot;It&#39;s just about midnight,&quot; Juri smiled, &quot;and I&#39;ve made a foolish 
promise that I&#39;m going to keep. Haruka, could you put on...&quot;

&quot;Let us pick the song!&quot; Haruka piped up, and she and Michiru bent over 
the console.

&quot;I have a very bad feeling about this,&quot; Setsuna murmured to Juri 
softly, and Juri nodded her agreement. As soon as the words began to 
come up, both Setsuna and Juri glared at Haruka.

They both finally decided just to play along, but was Juri ever going 
to make Haruka and Michiru pay for this later. Juri stepped forward to 
take the first part, and the room was shocked silent by the power of 
her voice, and the intensity she brought to the normally sappy words.

Deep in my soul, love so strong, it takes control, Now we both know, 
the secret&#39;s bared, the feelings show, Driven far apart, I make a wish 
on a shooting star,

Setsuna took up the next verse, and the undisguised longing in her 
voice took the crowd&#39;s breath away. She seemed so very alone, but as 
she completed the final line Juri stepped up to stand there beside 
her.

There will come a day, somewhere far away, In your arms I&#39;ll stay, my 
only love, Even though you&#39;re gone, love will still live on, the 
feeling is so strong, my only love, my only love.

Their two voices swelled together for the final verse, gazing more at 
each other than the karaoke screen in front of them. Two voices so 
very different flowed together, and the room became nearly silent as 
they sang the final lines.

There will come a day, somewhere far away, In your arms I&#39;ll stay, my 
only love, You&#39;ve reached the deepest part, of the secret in my heart, 
Known it from the start, My only love, My only love...

&quot;5... 4... 3.. 2... 1... Happy new year!&quot;

Juri glared at Haruka and Michiru, even as Haruka smiled weakly, &quot;It 
was just a random selection, really!&quot;

Juri rolled her eyes at that. Setsuna stood nearby, looking on with a 
certain amount of amusement while she waited for her turn at them. 
&quot;You go first,&quot; Juri finally sighed, &quot;I need to start closing up.&quot;

Setsuna waited before Juri was out of range, then she asked &quot;What were 
you thinking, choosing a song like that?&quot;

&quot;Hey, all you&#39;ve been talking about for the past few days is Juri,&quot; 
Michiru frowned. &quot;I admit our approach lacked subtlety, but still...&quot;

Setsuna blushed, &quot;I haven&#39;t been that bad.&quot;

Juri came back, smiling with satisfaction. &quot;The last of the customers 
too intoxicated to drive are in cabs on their way home,&quot; Juri nodded. 
She looked over at Haruka and Michiru seriously, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t have 
embarrassed Setsuna like that.&quot;

Setsuna was a bit startled by that. &#39;She&#39;s worried about how I feel,&#39; 
she thought, looking over at Juri thoughtfully.

Both Haruka and Michiru looked intrigued by that as well. &quot;You&#39;re 
worried about us embarrassing her, not you Juri?&quot; Haruka smiled.

&quot;What?&quot; Juri seemed a bit flustered under Haruka and Michiru&#39;s gazes.

Setsuna reached out, laying her hand on Juri&#39;s arm. &quot;It&#39;s all right, 
Juri,&quot; Setsuna smiled at her. A bit of a flush marked Juri&#39;s cheeks, 
and she looked away from her shyly. Setsuna leaned over, and gently 
kissed her on the cheek, &quot;My hero.&quot;

Juri almost went beet red. &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; she finally managed to 
get out.
