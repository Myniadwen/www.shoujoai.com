<a href="../ranma/amamon-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;Hey, Dr. Tofu,&quot; Ukyou called out as she and Ryouga entered the clinic. She was 
finally back, and with any luck it would stay that way. &quot;Sorry I&#39;m late.&quot;

&quot;Gromph?&quot; Ukyou and Ryouga turned to face the giant panda sweeping the clinic 
lobby.

&quot;Oh, hi Mr. Saotome,&quot; Ryouga said calmly. &quot;Are we very late?&quot;

&quot;Gromph, grom grom,&quot; the panda held up a sign that read. &quot;You&#39;re only ten 
minutes late, how is that possible?&quot; A large drop of sweat rolled down Ryouga&#39;s 
forehead.

&quot;Err,&quot; Ryouga sounded embarrassed. &quot;We took taxis.&quot;

The sign flipped around and read &quot;Oh, that explains it.&quot;

&quot;Miss Kuonji,&quot; Dr. Tofu said as he walked into the room. &quot;This is the first time 
you&#39;ve ever been late for an appointment. Usually you&#39;re punctual to the point 
of obsession.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Ukyou asked.

&quot;You noticed that too?&quot; Ryouga blurted out.

*CLANG*

&quot;Have you been taking lessons from Akane?&quot; Genma-Panda&#39;s sign asked. Ukyou 
narrowed her eyes.

*CLANG*CLANG*CLANG*

&quot;Why&#39;d you do that?&quot; Ryouga asked, rubbing his head as he stood up.

&quot;I need an excuse to hit Genma?&quot; Ukyou asked. &quot;Does anybody?&quot; Ryouga thought 
about it for a moment.

&quot;Yeah, I guess not,&quot; he finally agreed.

&quot;Traitor,&quot; the battered panda&#39;s sign read.

&quot;You know, now that I think about it,&quot; Ryouga said after seeing the sign. &quot;Ranma 
kicked me towards the cliff, I think it was My. Panda here that originally 
forced me into that leap.&quot;

&quot;I have to go, work to do,&quot; Genma&#39;s new sign read. &quot;Bye.&quot; The panda wasted no 
time in leaving the room.

&quot;I see you&#39;re using that arm despite what I said,&quot; Dr. Tofu noted as he circled 
Ukyou critically.

&quot;Well....it felt alright,&quot; Ukyou said tentatively.

&quot;That&#39;s okay, you&#39;re actually right on schedule.&quot;

&quot;What!!? But you said-*&quot;

&quot;Yes, well, I knew you&#39;d ignore that, so I added to my estimate.&quot;

&quot;You what?&quot;

&quot;Roughly doubled all my the estimates of how long you&#39;d be in the sling and 
cast.&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;ve already been in the cast the entire month!!&quot;

&quot;Yes, very surprising.&quot;

&quot;You mean I could have been out of this contraption all this time!?!&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Kodachi silently marveled at the Tendo dojo. As always she wondered how they 
could rest so easy at night without even the most basic of booby traps. Of 
course they did seem to be quite nervous, except for that nice Kasumi woman that 
had prepared the second guest room for her. The two fathers, on the other hand, 
seemed to clear the room whenever Kodachi appeared. The gymnast hadn&#39;t yet 
figured out why they should be so jumpy around her.

At the moment Kodachi was enjoying a nice quiet meal after school. She had taken 
a gamble and was surprised when it paid off. Apparently there were no drugs in 
this soup Kasumi had made. Then she heard the door open and soon there was 
whispering coming from the kitchen. Finally, her Ranma-Darling was home.

Kodachi then narrowed her eyes and wondered where Mousse was. She had yet to 
thank him properly for saving her life. So it was now a matter of duty and honor 
to make sure that he won the heart of that blue-haired bimbo. The gymnast paused 
in her thinking to complain about Shampoo flirting around with all the men. Then 
she went back to plotting. Mousse deserved to be happy, and if saddling him with 
Shampoo was what it was going to take then so be it.

At this point she realized that she had forgotten all about her &quot;Ranma-Darling.&quot; 
The gymnast gasped and rose from the table immediately.

&quot;Kasumi, what&#39;s Kodachi doing in the dining room,&quot; Akane asked nervously. She 
and Ranma looked beat, having spent most of the night searching for the Ukyou 
look alike. Then they had to go to school. So it had roughly been thirty-six 
hours since either of them had really slept. Not that martial artists of their 
caliber lost much capability until somewhere around a week without sleep, but 
like anybody, they preferred to get it regularly.

&quot;Oh, Mousse brought her by last night while you were out,&quot; Kasumi explained.

&quot;Okay, but that still doesn&#39;t explain what she&#39;s doing here now,&quot; Akane pressed 
a little. Ranma was a little ways down the hall keeping an eye on the dining 
room entrance way.

&quot;Well, apparently she needed a place to stay,&quot; Kasumi told them calmly.

&quot;And you let her stay here,&quot; Ranma protested as quietly as he could.

&quot;Well I couldn&#39;t just refuse her,&quot; Kasumi explained further. &quot;Poor dear, seemed 
to be in a state of shock.&quot;

&quot;Rannma-Darling,&quot; the high-pitched voice elicited a shiver from Ranma and Akane 
both. &quot;I&#39;m sooo happy to see you.&quot; She didn&#39;t seem in shock at all, in fact she 
seemed to be her normal clingy self.

&quot;Uhh.....Kodachi!&quot; Ranma screeched. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Her familial 
problems aside, Ranma and Akane still thought of Kodachi as a rather dangerous 
lunatic.

&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind me staying here,&quot; Kodachi leaned against the petrified 
Ranma and twirled his ponytail around in her fingers.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Akane protested. The mallet appeared in her hands.

&quot;But you see, I had a little disagreement with my brother,&quot; she got that out 
just as the mallet crushed Ranma into the ground.

&quot;In front of my sister no less!&quot; Akane shouted. &quot;Excuse me, did you just say 
that you had a disagreement with your brother.&quot;

&quot;Why yes, though I don&#39;t see what business it is of yours,&quot; Kodachi jabbed her 
face at Akane.

&quot;Ummm,&quot; Akane started, sounding embarrassed. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;He was a little more upset than usual, but Mousse kept things from going too 
far,&quot; Kodachi answered. &quot;Why do you care?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Akane said, mildly insulted. &quot;I didn&#39;t...&quot; Ranma interrupted her.

&quot;Oh, we&#39;re just interested in tracking him down,&quot; he said, changing the subject 
almost completely. Akane glared at him.

&quot;Well, I have no idea where he is right now,&quot; Kodachi said snobbishly. &quot;I think 
that little toad of his took him off somewhere.&quot;

&quot;Well, if you&#39;ll excuse us now, we&#39;re very tired,&quot; Ranma said, doing his best to 
nudge Akane around and away from Kodachi. &quot;We can&#39;t find him now anyway.&quot;

&quot;Hmm, yes.&quot; Kodachi answered. &quot;And I have my own affairs to attend to. Ta Ta!! 
OO-hahahahahahahahahaha!!!&quot; Kodachi started leaping away in her normal fashion.

&quot;What was that all about!?!&quot; Akane demanded as she malleted Ranma into the 
ground.

&quot;Oww!!&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Sheesh, I was just trying to keep the property damage to a 
minimum. She&#39;s still calling them &#39;disagreements.&#39; I doubt she&#39;d admit that Kuno 
beats her up and doubt even more that she&#39;d like it brought up.&quot;

&quot;Like you&#39;re an expert on abuse,&quot; Akane snorted. Ranma looked at her and then 
walked to his room.

&quot;Yeah, the only thing I know about is fighting,&quot; Ranma replied, closing the door 
behind him.

&quot;What&#39;s his problem?&quot; Akane asked before yawning and going to her own room.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&quot;Oh beauteous Shampoo,&quot; Mousse began before he was slammed into the Cat Cafe 
wall.

&quot;Stupid Mousse get out of way,&quot; Shampoo said. She was thinking. &quot;Money-girl very 
smart, but wish she hurry up and set up crazy-girl and Mousse.&quot;

&quot;Why can&#39;t you get it through your thick head that Shampoo doesn&#39;t want you,&quot; 
Cologne asked Mousse.

&quot;That right, Shampoo love...&quot; Cologne regarded her great-granddaughter as she 
paused in brief confusion. &quot;...Ranma...yes...Shampoo love Ranma.&quot; 

&quot;Ah ha!&quot; Mousse declared pointing. &quot;You hesitated! If you don&#39;t love Ranma, then 
who else could you love?&quot;

&quot;Shampoo love Ranma,&quot; Shampoo insisted strongly again. &quot;Who else?&quot;

&quot;Ranma, eh,&quot; he smirked. &quot;Not Airen?&quot;

&quot;Did you manage to find the Kuno girl yesterday, Mousse?&quot; Cologne asked 
half-bored, trying to change the subject. It was more than decently successful.

&quot;Crazy-girl, take your head off?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not crazy,&quot; Mousse protested. He paused and considered the problem of 
pairing the undeserving Saotome with Kodachi. Mousse had thought that he had 
detected a hint of sympathy while the arrogant fool was watching Kodachi&#39;s 
tapes. Perhaps he could use that. Kodachi deserved to be happy and well if she 
wanted Saotome, oh well. There was no accounting for taste.

&quot;Who you kidding?&quot; Shampoo asked.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t judge someone so quickly,&quot; Mousse countermanded, not noticing 
that he was arguing with his &quot;Lady Love.&quot;

&quot;Could you get started working so Shampoo can get in her training for the day?&quot; 
Cologne asked irritably.

&quot;Certainly,&quot; Mousse said, in an equally annoyed tone. Shampoo just shrugged and 
started walking out the door.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&quot;Hey chief,&quot; Yuka called as she jogged up to join the strolling Nabiki. &quot;You 
were right, we&#39;ve been getting a lot of bet calls involving Copycat Ken since 
yesterday.&quot;

&quot;Copycat Ken,&quot; Nabiki repeated. &quot;Just what I need right now.&quot; Sayuri joined them 
at a much more sedate pace than Yuka.

&quot;It seems that Tatewaki Kuno was released yesterday as well,&quot; she said. &quot;But I 
suspect that you already knew that.&quot; Nabiki snorted, she hadn&#39;t, but she&#39;d 
assumed it. There was no reason other reason for a duplicate Ukyou to be in that 
part of town.

They were walking around the small park, going no particular place, and talking 
all the way.

&quot;So what do you want to do about Kuno?&quot; Yuka asked. &quot;Contact that ninja again?&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately, he might think I&#39;m legitimate, but I don&#39;t think he cares.&quot; 
Nabiki stomped her foot, she couldn&#39;t imagine a ninja hiding the kind of 
information that was on those tapes from his superiors.

&quot;Hey, isn&#39;t that Shampoo,&quot; Sayuri asked. Nabiki looked up the trail towards a 
clearing where the amazon was running katas. Nabiki paused in walking, and 
watched for a moment. Nabiki had seen numerous fights and refereed more than a 
few matches herself. She decided in watching Shampoo train that it was a great 
travesty that she had never been able to see many of Shampoo&#39;s best matches.

&quot;Her form is...very good,&quot; Nabiki noted. She watched the smooth dance-like 
movements almost rapt by the near perfection. Nabiki wished momentarily that she 
could fight that well, and of course there was that body. Nabiki sighed 
desolately.

&quot;Chief?&quot; Yuka asked tentatively. &quot;Anything wrong?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you ever wish you could have that?&quot; Nabiki asked.

&quot;Have what?&quot; Sayuri started, then an uncomfortable thought struck her. 

&quot;Shampoo?&quot;

&quot;What gave you that idea?&quot; Nabiki snapped. &quot;The skill and the beauty, you know?&quot;

&quot;Right, of course, what was I thinking?&quot;

&quot;Hey, let&#39;s go to the diner and pool the info on Sasuke, Ken, and Kuno.&quot;

&quot;What about the Kodachi/Mousse project?&quot; the questioner was Yuka.

&quot;Or the various betting pools?&quot;

&quot;And the watches on Cologne and Happosai?&quot; Nabiki sighed, she was too strung 
out, information was taking too long to get to her. She was the mistress of 
Nerima, but usually activity in the area was limited to one or two plots 
centering on Ranma. She had to admit that her network wasn&#39;t prepared for 
dealing with so many projects at once. The yakuza had almost slipped an 
operation past her last week. They had already set up their equipment by the 
time Nabiki could arrange for the police to receive an anonymous tip.

Nabiki forced herself to turn away from the spectacle of Shampoo and start 
walking out of the park.

&quot;Well we can&#39;t let anybody know we&#39;re stretched out,&quot; Nabiki noted first. &quot;The 
watches on Cologne and Happosai stay, I want to know their plans before they do. 
Leave the normal staff on the betting pools. Everybody else keep an eye out for 
Kuno and friends.&quot;

&quot;And Kodachi and Mousse?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s take care of Kuno first,&quot; Nabiki said. &quot;The other won&#39;t matter so much if 
Kuno kills his sister.&quot; Nabiki didn&#39;t yet know that the would-be samurai had 
already tried.

&quot;Hey, money-girl!&quot; they all stopped when they heard Shampoo&#39;s voice calling out. 
The amazon leaped down to them. &quot;Shampoo want talk to you.&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Nabiki answered without hesitation. Sayuri and Yuka sighed in 
frustration. &quot;There&#39;s a good place.&quot;

&quot;That theatre,&quot; Shampoo noted flatly.

&quot;Yeah, so?&quot;

&quot;I pick movie this time.&quot; Nabiki thought about for a moment.

&quot;Make it good.&quot;

&quot;Aiya,&quot; Shampoo said happily and then she started toward the theatre, Nabiki 
following soon after.

&quot;What is with those two?&quot; Yuka asked.

&quot;Must be a lot of money involved somewhere.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
*CLANG* Ryouga was smacked into the ground. He noticed that the hit wasn&#39;t as 
hard this time, he decided it might have something to do with the fact that 
Ukyou had hit him with a one handed smash. Her other hand was occupied in 
holding her the foot of her formerly broken leg off the ground. She was hopping 
around and grimacing in a combination of pain and anger.

&quot;What was that for?&quot; Ryouga demanded.

&quot;Watch where you&#39;re walking will you,&quot; Ukyou told him. &quot;My leg still hurts a 
little you know.&quot;

&quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; Ryouga said sheepishly as he stood up and scratched his head. &quot;Do 
you need help?&quot; Ukyou rolled her eyes and then laughed in pleased surprise. 
&quot;Hey, its a new Jackie Chan movie!!&quot;

&quot;A what?&quot; Ryouga asked.

&quot;A Jackie Chan movie,&quot; Ukyou repeated, as if that explained everything. &quot;Don&#39;t 
you know who Jackie Chan is?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Ryouga said. &quot;He&#39;s one of the best martial artists around, they 
made a movie about him?&quot; Ukyou rolled her eyes and then half limped, dragging 
Ryouga along.

&quot;Come on, let&#39;s go see it,&quot; Ukyou demanded. &quot;We&#39;ve missed the day for opening 
Ucchan&#39;s anyway.&quot;

&quot;I guess so, I don&#39;t much like documentaries though.&quot;

&quot;Would you prefer Titanic?&quot;

&quot;Jackie Chan it is!&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&quot;Miss Kuno,&quot; Cologne addressed Kodachi as she entered the Cat Cafe. &quot;It is a 
pleasure to see you again.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Kodachi asked with a hint of disbelief. She sat down at a table and 
waited for service.

&quot;Kodachi?&quot; Mousse asked with a little surprise.

&quot;Oh, there you are,&quot; Kodachi declared, she was wondering how he recognized her. 
&quot;And where is Shampoo?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s out training somewhere,&quot; Mousse said non-commitally.

&quot;Well if that&#39;s all the enthusiasm your going to show,&quot; Kodachi started in mock 
annoyance. &quot;I see no reason for you to have my help.&quot;

&quot;And how was Saotome this morning?&quot;

&quot;Ranma didn&#39;t get in until after school,&quot; Kodachi answered. &quot;Hey and the Tendo 
girl were tired and went to bed soon after that.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not a good sign,&quot; Mousse said. Kodachi scowled at him.

&quot;Hey, blind boy!&quot; they heard Cologne yell. &quot;Take her order and get to the other 
customers!&quot;

&quot;Alright, you old ghoul,&quot; Mousse grumbled, he turned back to Kodachi. &quot;So what 
do you want?&quot;

&quot;Hmm, I&#39;ll have the chicken-beef special,&quot; Kodachi said. &quot;And one of those 
American sodas, Dr. Pepper. Always wanted to try those.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; Mousse wrote it down. &quot;Be right back.&quot;

&quot;I shall be here.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&quot;Jackie Chan is an...actor?&quot; Ryouga said again for perhaps the tenth time.

&quot;Shh,&quot; Ukyou ordered. &quot;Yeah, just like Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris.&quot;

&quot;Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris made movies!?!!&quot; Ryouga shouted bolting to a 
standing position. He was answered with a chorus of shushes and Ukyou jerking 
him back down.

&quot;Quiet, people are trying to enjoy the movie.&quot; Ryouga continued to watch 
somewhat confused. He didn&#39;t know whether to laugh or cry, as far as he was 
concerned this was fairly close to blaspheme. It was a hilarious movie however.

A little further down in the theatre, Shampoo and Nabiki were among those 
shushing Ryouga.

&quot;Really, I can&#39;t believe some people,&quot; Nabiki complained.

&quot;That sound familiar,&quot; Shampoo said. Nabiki agreed, but she was trying to relax 
right now. On the screen Jackie and two of the female sidekicks were running 
every which way trying to escape a bunch of hit men of some sort. There were a 
couple of really funny scenes after they hit the car chase, and Shampoo and 
Nabiki started laughing trying to keep it quiet.

Shampoo leaned over and tapped on Nabiki&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Maybe Ranma take romance lessons from Jackie Chan movies,&quot; she suggested. Both 
girls burst out in hysterical laughter, leaning on each other for support. They 
stood out from the rest of the audience only a little, laughter being fairly 
prevalent in scattered patches through the theatre.

&quot;Um, Shampoo,&quot; Nabiki started as they both calmed down.

&quot;Nabiki?&quot; Shampoo asked catching her breath.

&quot;Where&#39;s your hand?&quot; They both asked at nearly the same time. Well, Shampoo&#39;s 
came out more like &quot;Where hand,&quot; but you get the picture.

They both looked down to where Shampoo was apparently copping a feel on Nabiki&#39;s 
breast, and Nabiki seemed to have a handful of Shampoo&#39;s thigh. They turned beet 
red and virtually slammed back into their seats, paying exaggerated attention to 
the movie.

Ukyou noticed a couple, she couldn&#39;t tell anymore than that, apparently making 
out a few rows down. At least they had been until something embarrassed them, 
Ukyou thought it was a good idea. She looked over towards Ryouga and saw that he 
was still sulky, but at least he was starting to relax a little. The lost boy 
didn&#39;t notice at first when Ukyou raised the arm between her seat and his. He 
noticed however when Ukyou leaned back and snuggled against his chest.

&quot;Hey, we&#39;re in public,&quot; he protested quietly, more out of habit than any real 
complaint. This was proved by the fact that he shifted his position to allow her 
easy access up to his lap.

&quot;Be quiet and no one will notice,&quot; she whispered. Circling her arms backward 
around his head and shoulders. His arms circled her waist and he leaned his head 
on her shoulder. They both just quietly watched the movie and enjoyed each 
other&#39;s presence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Akane couldn&#39;t sleep, merely turned about restlessly. Something was bothering 
her. It wasn&#39;t long before she was up and dressed. Maybe a quick jog would give 
her some time to think things through and decide what exactly was bothering her.

She thought back over the day and couldn&#39;t place her unease on anything. Not 
even the Kuno situation, though she had heard from some of Nabiki&#39;s crew that 
the samurai was indeed out of jail again. No it had been a mostly average, for 
Nerima, day right up until she and Ranma went off to bed after getting home from 
school.

She had passed the park and was rounding the still empty Ucchan&#39;s when she 
remembered that last conversation. She didn&#39;t understand why Ranma was being so 
cautious around Kodachi&#39;s feelings while not seeming to care at all about a, 
marginally, more sane Shampoo. Then she thought about another sentence of his 
from the day before. She had almost forgotten it.

&quot;Kuno must read the same books as my old man,&quot; he had said. She stopped and 
thought about the various times Genma had sold Ranma for meals and the repeated 
cat fist training sessions. Then she felt a deep sense of guilt and shame about 
her own behavior earlier that day. She turned back around and started back to 
the dojo.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Kasumi was looking at an odd little delivery man. &quot;I have a package 
here for a&quot; he checked the label. &quot;Akane Tendo.&quot;

&quot;Oh, wait here a moment, I&#39;ll go and get her,&quot; Kasumi disappeared back into the 
dojo. Surprisingly she couldn&#39;t find her sister, she tentatively knocked on the 
guest room that held Ranma and Genma&#39;s bed rolls. She half-hoped that she would 
find Akane in there, and half-dreaded it. &quot;Excuse me, Ranma?&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot; a bleary voiced Ranma asked. Kasumi was one of the few people that 
could wake him up easily. There was something instinctive in the human being 
that dreaded hurting Kasumi&#39;s feelings.

&quot;There is a package here for Akane, but I can&#39;t find her anywhere.&quot; The door 
opened, revealing Ranma still in his day clothes blinking away the sleep.

&quot;And you thought she&#39;d be in here?&quot; he was mildly insulted. &quot;Never mind, I&#39;ll 
get it.&quot; He shuffled to the door and regarded the delivery man.

&quot;Akane&#39;s not here at the moment,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ll sign for it.&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; the delivery man handed over the clipboard and Ranma signed it. The 
delivery man then handed the large package over to Ranma and waved nonchalantly 
as he left. Ranma looked over the package and immediately noticed something odd.

&quot;To Akane Tendo from Ranma Saotome?&quot; he read aloud in confusion. &quot;What the?&quot; 
Curiosity overwhelming him, he opened the box. A green mist rose up and 
enveloped his face. His eyes crossed and he fell backwards, unconscious.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The lights came back on suddenly, at least so it seemed to the two couples in 
the theatre. Ryouga and Ukyou had given over to &quot;pillow talk&quot; soon after the 
credits had started rolling. Truth be told they had probably lost track of the 
movie a good thirty minutes earlier. 

Shampoo and Ukyou had calmed down tremendously after that first...incident, and 
began chatting over &quot;business&quot; while waiting for the theatre to clear. Though 
they tried, the conversation didn&#39;t remain professional for much longer than a 
minute. At which point it degenerated into basic gossip and small talk. It was 
doubtful whether either of them noticed the shift in mood.

Then came the lights, the sudden and blinding lights that revealed a nearly 
empty theatre. All four of them blinked and squinted their eyes to clear the 
glare. None of them quite saw the theatre employee enter and leave quickly.

&quot;Sorry!&quot; they all heard just before the door shut behind him. Then Ukyou looked 
down at the other couple in the room as Shampoo looked up.

&quot;You!!&quot; both said at the same time.

&quot;Knew that voice sound familiar,&quot; Shampoo declared. &quot;Lost-boy ruin movie, 
shouldn&#39;t go to theatre.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Ryouga protested. &quot;I only yelled that one time.&quot; Ukyou ignored the 
exchange and pointed, somewhat pale, at the pair.

&quot;You two were the couple making out?&quot; she asked in shock. Both Shampoo and 
Nabiki turned as red as Ukyou was pale, and the chef was competing with 
Kodachi&#39;s normal color. Ryouga just looked confused.

&quot;We were not making out,&quot; Nabiki protested. &quot;We were laughing at a joke.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, Shampoo not mean put hand there.&quot; Nabiki winced. Ryouga finally 
understood what was going on.

&quot;You&#39;re dating Shampoo, Nabiki?&quot; Ryouga asked, calmly, apparently rhetorically, 
because he went right ahead talking. &quot;Hmm, that&#39;s surprising.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re awfully calm about this,&quot; Ukyou noted.

&quot;Get it through thick head,&quot; Shampoo shouted. &quot;We not dating.&quot;

&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Ryouga assured them. &quot;We won&#39;t tell anybody. Will we 
Ukyou?&quot;

&quot;What?!?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re not dating, we were discussing...uh...business,&quot; Nabiki said, wishing she 
really had been talking about business and not where to go to eat from here.

&quot;Like I said,&quot; Ryouga seemed to be ignoring them. &quot;We didn&#39;t see anything.&quot; He 
virtually had to drag the half-shocked Ukyou out of the theatre with him.

&quot;Great,&quot; Nabiki moaned quietly. &quot;Now they think we&#39;re dating.&quot;

&quot;Crazy lost-boy not matter,&quot; Shampoo said. &quot;We not dating, so no problem, where 
we eat again?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, probably best not to press the matter,&quot; Nabiki agreed. &quot;Otherwise it 
might just get worse. Um I don&#39;t think we had decided where to eat.&quot; Then she 
realized something. &quot;Damn it! When did they get in town?&quot;

&quot;You not know?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going to have to fix this problem,&quot; she stomped her foot and scowled. &quot;Damn 
it, I knew when Cologne first started heading this way.&quot;

&quot;She travel with lost-boy, how you keep track of him?&quot; Nabiki blinked and then 
shrugged.

&quot;Good point.&quot;

Outside in the lobby, Ukyou and Ryouga were heading out into daylight.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?&quot; Ryouga asked her.

&quot;There were two girls making out in there,&quot; Ukyou whispered. &quot;Girls we know.&quot;

&quot;So?&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#39;t bother you?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;It took me two days of effort to get you to calm down enough just to hug me?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but whatever they&#39;re doing doesn&#39;t involve me.&quot;

&quot;Sometimes I just don&#39;t understand you, let&#39;s just go say hi to Ranma and Akane 
and then go home.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Ranma awoke in the hallway and found himself looking down at the package. There 
was something wrong, but he couldn&#39;t quite put his finger on it. Of course there 
was the fact that a package supposedly from him to Akane had contained some kind 
of gas, but there was something more.

Ranma was still trying to figure it out when he heard the voice behind him.
&quot;What are you DOING opening MY mail?!?!&quot; It was Akane, but she wasn&#39;t home, 
Kasumi had looked for her.

&quot;Well it was addressed from me,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;And I don&#39;t remember sending you 
anything by post! Besides when I opened it, something knocked me out.&quot;

&quot;That was me you pervert!!&quot; That made sense to Ranma, almost, it was too easy. 
Akane attacked with her mallet and Ranma barely dodged.

&quot;She&#39;s gotten faster,&quot; Ranma thought to himself as the mallet came in again, 
this time it took out part of the wall. &quot;Damn! She&#39;s really mad this time, I 
better get the mallet away from her.&quot; The next time the mallet came down he 
lanced out a foot to snap the head away from the handle. 

Akane&#39;s swing continued unhindered, and there was no sudden stop to end her 
forward momentum. Akane cried out once as she flew forward and into the corner 
of one of the walls, then she fell to the ground in silence. Something in the 
back of Ranma&#39;s head was flashing warning signs, Akane was much better than 
that. Unfortunately for Ranma he was too preoccupied to listen to his deeper 
misgivings any more.

&quot;Akane?&quot; Ranma asked cautiously. He looked at her lying there in an odd jumbled 
like a dropped doll. &quot;Akane, are you okay?&quot; He reached over and turned her 
around so that she looked face up. Then he felt his soul crack.

Akane stared up with sightless eyes, a deep gash in her forehead where she had 
struck the corner of the wall. Ranma looked up and saw that the wall was smeared 
with blood, how could he have missed it before.

&quot;Akane!! NOOOOO!!!!!!!&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&quot;Ranma?&quot; Kasumi said half shocked as she rounded a corner, seeing Ranma lying 
back against the wall. The package lay opened in front of him. &quot;What are you 
doing opening Akane&#39;s mail?&quot; Ranma didn&#39;t respond, she saw him breathing easily 
and assumed that he had just passed out from fatigue. &quot;Really, imagine the 
nerve.&quot;

Kasumi took the package, and closed it up without checking the contents, placing 
it on the table in the hall. She then addressed the problem of Ranma&#39;s 
unconscious form. At this point Akane came back in the door and managed to trip 
over him.

&quot;Hey, Ranma?&quot; Akane said confused. &quot;What are you doing asleep in the hallway?&quot;

&quot;Oh, Akane,&quot; Kasumi declared then. &quot;There&#39;s a package for you there.&quot; Akane 
disentangled herself from the unconscious form of her fiancee. It wasn&#39;t unusual 
for Ranma to sleep through almost everything, but he usually didn&#39;t fall asleep 
until he reached his bed roll. She took the package and looked at it.

&quot;To Akane Tendo from Ranma Saotome?&quot; Akane repeated. &quot;Oh, I wonder what this 
is?&quot; She opened it and all she found inside was an envelope addressed to Ranma.

&quot;That&#39;s odd,&quot; Kasumi noted. &quot;Why would Ranma mail you a letter addressed to 
him?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think this is from Ranma,&quot; Akane said, she looked down at the sleeping 
form, worried.

&quot;Ranma - By now your dear Akane has opened your &#39;gift&#39; I won&#39;t bore you with the 
name of the drug, I&#39;ll just tell you what it does. Even now Akane is trapped in 
a series of unending nightmares, facing all her greatest fears. She will stay 
this way until you apply the antidote, which is in my position. If you want 
Akane to wake up, sane, then you must fight me one last time for the antidote. 
The soccer field, I want your defeat to be public and humiliating. - Copycat 
Ken.&quot; Akane dropped the letter, her face pale. She launched herself at Ranma and 
began vigorously shaking him, trying to wake him up.

&quot;Ranma? Ranma?!? RANMA wake-up!! BAKA!!!! WAKE-UP!!! BAKA!!! HENTAI!!!! 
WAKE-UP!!!....Ranma....wake...up.....please&quot; she gave up, leaned over his almost 
motionless form and sobbing. Kasumi blinked at the display and picked up the 
letter, wondering what it said.

&quot;Oh dear,&quot; it was all she said, as usual. Akane stood up then, her face enraged, 
and ran on out the door. &quot;Akane wait.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s dead!!&quot; Kasumi heard her yelling in the distance. &quot;I&#39;m going to kill 
him!!&quot; This time she actually meant the words.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&quot;It seems that Shampoo is not going to be back anytime soon,&quot; Kodachi noted.

&quot;Are you going to eat the rest of that?&quot; Mousse asked, pointing at the barely 
touched ramen bowl.

&quot;Oh, that is far too much for me all on my own.&quot;

&quot;Do you eat like this all the time?&quot;

&quot;Of course not,&quot; Kodachi said, only a little hesitantly. They all felt the 
approach of a supreme concentration of battle chi approaching. &quot;Is that 
barbarian back already?&quot;

&quot;You mean Ryouga, I suppose,&quot; Cologne noted. All three regarded the street where 
they expected the fighter to pass. They saw the glow first.

&quot;Whoah, he&#39;s very mad,&quot; Mousse noted. Then Akane nearly flew by. The three 
warriors dropped to the floor. &quot;I wonder what Saotome did this time?&quot; Both the 
women understood differently.

&quot;You should rather ask what happened to Ranma,&quot; Cologne suggested.

&quot;It seems that I have to leave,&quot; Kodachi said fully proper. &quot;Perhaps Miss Tendo 
could use some help.&quot; Mousse felt a twinge of jealousy almost, though he knew 
helping Akane might help Kodachi win Ranma.

&quot;I&#39;ll go with you,&quot; Mousse said. &quot;As angry as she is, she won&#39;t need much help, 
but you never can tell.&quot; Kodachi seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, but it may 
have been his imagination.

&quot;Good,&quot; Cologne agreed. &quot;Go, I shall be fine here.&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&quot;Isn&#39;t this where we first met?&quot; Ryouga asked.

&quot;Yeah, which is past the dojo,&quot; she glanced suspiciously at Ryouga. &quot;How did we 
get here?&quot; Ryouga shrugged.

&quot;That was only two years ago right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s right, actually it&#39;s good we&#39;re here. It fits. I want to talk 
about something.&quot;

&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Ryouga noticed that there was a teasing tone to her voice. It was 
the same tone she got when coming up with a new plan. There was, something 
behind it though, a hint of worry to the voice though.

&quot;Maybe when we finally get to Ucchan&#39;s we can start moving your stuff into the 
main bedroom?&quot; She watched him closely, gauging his reactions.

&quot;Are you sure that&#39;s a good idea?&quot; Ryouga gulped. Snuggling and living in the 
same house was one thing, but he didn&#39;t want to take advantage of this new 
relationship with Ukyou. She might not actually want him, this might just be one 
of those nurse/patient things he had heard of. &quot;Could you fit my bed in there?&quot;

&quot;Why would we need two beds?&quot; Ukyou resisted the urge to smack him. &quot;I mean 
we&#39;ve been sleeping together pretty much the entire month.&quot; To herself she added 
a slightly frustrated after thought. &quot;And sleeping has been about all we were 
doing.&quot;

&quot;But we were camping,&quot; he protested. &quot;We&#39;re not even engaged.&quot; Ukyou sighed, 
Ryouga was far to chivalrous sometimes. She stopped and looked up at him, 
Ryouga&#39;s tread ceased as well and he turned to face her, nervously. All the 
teasing was gone from her face. She looked like someone about to fall off a 
cliff in hopes that she would survive. That was something that Ryouga had a lot 
of experience with.

&quot;Ryouga,&quot; Ukyou said softly, looking up into his face. &quot;I want you more than I 
ever did Ranma. I don&#39;t want to be under the same roof with you and not be able 
to feel you next to me. What about you?&quot; she paused a moment.

&quot;Ukyou, I-&quot; Ryouga started, feeling his heart rise in his chest. Ukyou 
forestalled his response with gentle touch to his lips.

&quot;Let me get this all out okay? Can you tell me outright, without the shy and 
chivalrous crap? Do you love me? Or am I just the next best thing to Akane?&quot; She 
paused, swallowed hard and asked one last question. &quot;Do you want to be mine?&quot;

&quot;I already am,&quot; Ryouga answered without hesitation, silently reprimanding 
himself for doubting their newly found feelings. Ukyou breathed a sigh of 
relief. She reached up as he leaned down and they met in the middle for their 
first real kiss.

After what felt like an eternity, they were brought back to the world in general 
by two bright flashes of light and the sound of polaroid photos being dispensed.
&quot;Good,&quot; Yuka said. &quot;We can collect on that pool then.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Ryouga said dropping the hand from his eyes. Ukyou glared at the pair 
and considered whether or not to flourbomb the both of them.

&quot;You guys haven&#39;t seen Nabiki around have you?&quot; Sayuri asked as Yuka was waiting 
for the film to develope. &quot;Last we saw her she was off doing something with 
Shampoo.&quot;

&quot;We just saw them at theatre,&quot; Ryouga said irritably. &quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;We just need to tell her something.&quot; Yuka said. &quot;Thanks.&quot; They started to leave 
and found themselves blocked in either direction by a weapon. An umbrella on one 
side and a spatula on the other.

&quot;The pictures,&quot; Ryouga noted.

&quot;Perhaps you could give them to us?&quot; Ukyou added.

&quot;You don&#39;t hit girls,&quot; Sayuri said confidently. Ryouga and Ukyou smiled, 
&quot;It&#39;s...in your dossier.&quot;

&quot;What about me?&quot; Ukyou asked. Nabiki&#39;s lieutenant&#39;s gulped.

&quot;Here,&quot; Yuka handed them over glumly.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Ukyou accepted both photos gladly. &quot;By the way, I wouldn&#39;t have hit 
you either. Hey, these are pretty good.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Sayuri shouted.

&quot;It&#39;s the whole don&#39;t bully the weak thing.&quot; Ryouga explained, as he was looking 
at one of the photos. &quot;You look great in this one.&quot;

&quot;You bluffed us?&quot;

&quot;Yep,&quot; Ukyou said. &quot;Oh, but you&#39;re so cute squinting at the flash in this one.&quot;

&quot;Well let&#39;s go on to the dojo, what do you say Ucchan?&quot;

&quot;An excellent idea, Ryochan,&quot; Ukyou agreed and then they were both walking on, 
leaving an annoyed Sayuri and Yuka behind.

&quot;Well?&quot; Yuka asked as soon as the martial artists were gone. Sayuri smiled and 
put her hand into a pocket. She stopped smiling.

&quot;I don&#39;t have the other camera,&quot; she retrieved a slip of paper and read it. 
&quot;&#39;Neither of you is Nabiki - R&amp;U.&#39;&quot;

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Sayuri said. &quot;Let&#39;s just go find Nabiki.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&quot;RANMA!!!&quot; Ranma looked up at the demon-head of Soun Tendo. &quot;HOW COULD YOU DO 
THIS!?!!&quot;

&quot;Where&#39;s Dr. Tofu?&quot; demanded Ranma. &quot;She can&#39;t be dead! She can&#39;t be!&quot;

&quot;I have always told you all that he is an evil that must be destroyed.&quot; It was 
Kuno.

&quot;Oh Ranma,&quot; Kasumi&#39;s face was pale, and the usually undauntable woman looked as 
if she was going to faint.

&quot;Don&#39;t just stand there!&quot; Ranma yelled. &quot;Call Dr. Tofu!&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no need to call me, murderer, I&#39;m right here.&quot;

&quot;Monster how can you claim to have loved Akane!&quot;

&quot;Ryouga? But you&#39;re in America!&quot;

&quot;Too think that I once loved you!&quot; He saw Ukyou getting ready to wield her 
spatula.

&quot;But it was an accident!&quot; Ranma fled out the door away from the growing mass of 
his enemies and friends.

&quot;Airen finally get rid of violent girl!&quot; For a moment the fear and confusion 
were replaced by an overwhelming rage. He turned to face Shampoo and found a 
half-cat, half-amazon. &quot;Aiya, Shampoo so happy.&quot;

&quot;No! No!! NO!!!&quot; Ranma backpedaled and ran in full flight away from the 
creature.

&quot;I appreciate the impulse, boy, iff it wasn&#39;t for that sword of your mother&#39;s&quot; 
he stopped and saw a panda speaking with his father&#39;s human voice. &quot;But perhaps 
you should have waited until after the marriage. Like father, like son, eh 
Ranma?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to kill her, it was an accident!&quot; Ranma was shocked to hear 
himself speaking with a girl&#39;s voice. He looked down and saw that he was indeed 
in female form.

&quot;Oh come on,&quot; and Ranma-Chan turned to face Ranma-Kun. &quot;You know you hated her. 
I&#39;ll bet you were even jealous of her. I&#39;ll bet you were even jealous of her. 
All those men chasing after her and only one or two after your female form.&quot;

&quot;This is a dream,&quot; Ranma realized suddenly. &quot;Something from that gas.&quot; Ranma 
smiled. &quot;I can handle this.&quot;

And then suddenly Ranma jolted awake. He was lying in a hospital bed, and he 
felt weak and tired. He heard a yawn and looked to see what he thought was 
Ukyou.

&quot;Ucchan?&quot; The name came out strained and weak. Even as he said it he knew that 
he was wrong. Ukyou didn&#39;t have fangs.

&quot;Mom!&quot; the almost-Ukyou yelled, startled.

&quot;I don&#39;t believe it,&quot; he heard a woman say. The voice was a little familiar. 

&quot;He&#39;s really awake.&quot;

&quot;Hello Ranma,&quot; said a man&#39;s voice. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot; Then Ranma turned his 
head and saw two people he immediately recognized as Ukyou and Ryouga. They were 
older than he had last seen them, both in their late thirties or early forties.

Then he caught a look at himself in a mirror. He was old, and his muscles were 
withered from long disuse.

&quot;This is still the nightmare,&quot; he said desperately. Ryouga and Ukyou looked at 
each other in concern.

&quot;I told you he wouldn&#39;t take it well,&quot; Ryouga said.

&quot;No, Ranma,&quot; Ukyou said gently. &quot;This is real, Dr. Tofu finally found the 
antidote.&quot;

&quot;What happened.&quot;

&quot;It was one of Kodachi&#39;s tricks,&quot; Ryouga told him. &quot;It was supposed to hit 
Akane.&quot;

&quot;Akane! What happened to Akane?&quot;

&quot;Is he talking about the Akane I&#39;m named after?&quot; The girl asked.

&quot;Yes, he is,&quot; Ranma had a sinking feeling that the news not good.

&quot;She faced off against Kodachi,&quot; Ryouga said. &quot;Of course no Kuno would fight 
fair.&quot;

&quot;Kodachi killed Akane,&quot; Ukyou said through a choked voice.

&quot;NO!!!&quot; Ranma shouted, Akane died because he wasn&#39;t there to protect her. It 
couldn&#39;t be. &quot;This is still the dream!!!&quot; Suddenly he was young again.

Ranma woke up slowly, as he usually did...
