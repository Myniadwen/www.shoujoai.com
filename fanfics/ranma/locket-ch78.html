The realm of Gaia was usually peaceful, but apparently
not this week. Explosions rang out in the distance as
Sailor Pluto spun her staff in the abandoned shell of
a village, the tall black haired woman&#39;s sailor skirt
swirling as she struck. &quot;You certainly know how to
show a girl a good time,&quot; she teased her companion in
the deserted home.

Arisugawa Juri grinned back, her energy sword glowing
orange as she swept through another wave of attackers,
carefully disarming them. A gift from the planet Jurai
it was a formidable weapon, especially combined with
her skills with a sword. &quot;It&#39;s not my fault,&quot; the
orange haired woman replied, &quot;Hitomi and Milerna
recommended this spot.&quot;

After firing off a dead scream into a band of
attacking warriors Sailor Pluto smiled wryly, &quot;I guess
they didn&#39;t realize things had gotten exciting here.&quot;

&quot;Either that,&quot; Juri said wryly, as the enemy&#39;s attacks
seemed to trail off, &quot;or they have a really
interesting idea of what a vacation should be.&quot;

&quot;Think they&#39;ve given up?&quot; Sailor Pluto asked warily.

&quot;Ho, Arisugawa!&quot; a male voice called out to them
cheerfully. A few moments later a tall, nicely dressed
blonde haired man made his way up to the house, his
long hair nearly glittering in the sunlight.

&quot;Friend of yours?&quot; Sailor Pluto asked warily.

The blonde reached them then he bowed charmingly as he
said, &quot;My name is Allen Schezar, ladies. Welcome to
Gaia.&quot;

Juri let her sword blade flicker out, even though she
kept a wary eye on Allan. &quot;What is going on?&quot; she
asked with a bit of amusement.

Allen&#39;s eyes gleamed with amusement, &quot;When I and my
comrades hear you were visiting, we thought we&#39;d make
your arrival a lively one.&quot;

&quot;You were taking quite a chance,&quot; Sailor Pluto noted
as she casually leaned against her staff, &quot;you could
have been killed.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s life without a bit of risk?&quot; Allan shrugged.
He smiled, &quot;Now that the introductions are out of the
way, Hitomi and Milerna instructed me to bring you
back to our sky-ship for dinner.&quot;

&quot;Shall we?&quot; Juri looked at Sailor Pluto with a slight
smile.

Sailor Pluto shimmered, her form shifting till Setsuna
Meiou stood in her place. &quot;Why not?&quot; she laughed,
&quot;Though Hitomi had better make up for this little
surprise.&quot;

&quot;I believe she has every intention to,&quot; Allen
cheerfully agreed as they set out, leaving the
battered house and setting off down a stone walkway
through the mountain village. The air was crisp and
clean up there, and the sun shone down over a town
that almost resembled some long lost European hamlet.

&quot;I still can&#39;t get over how unspoiled Gaea is,&quot; Juri
noted as they descended, seeing the young men and
women they had fought gathering their comrades and
returning either to their own vessels or to a larger
ship floating nearby.

&quot;The war was hard,&quot; Allen conceded, &quot;but we&#39;ve worked
hard to rebuild.&quot;

They reached the bottom of the trail where the great
ship floated, looking absurdly like some wooden
cruiser from a hundred or more years ago. Women and
men waved cheerfully from the railing, while a walk
way had been extended to allow them to board.

&quot;Setsuna,&quot; Juri waved for her wife to board first,
then followed her up while keeping a wary eye on their
hosts.

&quot;How did you like our little surprise?&quot; Milerna
smirked, looking like some kind of pirate as the
blonde haired woman lounged by the wheel.

&quot;Enjoy your moment,&quot; Setsuna nodded to her as she said
in a deadly purr, &quot;because paybacks are a bitch.&quot;

Milerna paled as Hitomi stepped up, her short brown
hair making the seer look oddly boyish. &quot;Juri,&quot; she
sighed, &quot;can you keep your scary wife under control?&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Juri smirked. &quot;I&#39;m pretty much in agreement.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll bribe you with food,&quot; Milerna offered
hopefully.

Allen added with a grin, &quot;And I think the twins Eriya
and Naria are going to preform for all of us tonight.&quot;

&quot;That might just do it,&quot; Setsuna conceded after a
moment&#39;s thought.

&quot;Now,&quot; a older man said as the tall figure dressed in
battered leathers hauled out a keg of beer, &quot;let the
revels begin!&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0

&quot;So,&quot; May asked as the brown haired female cyberdoll
helped close up the bar, &quot;what do you think Juri and
Setsuna are doing now?&quot;

&quot;I bet I can guess,&quot; Excel smirked as she
energetically helped stack chairs.

&quot;Excel,&quot; Keiko gave the other girl a frown, her brown
braid bumping against her back. She wiped down a table
as she mused, &quot;I sort of wish she had said where they
were going. What if something happens?&quot;

&quot;I think that&#39;s why they didn&#39;t tell us where they
were going,&quot; Sasami noted, the dark blue haired girl
emerging from the now spotlessly kitchen.

&quot;You know what I mean,&quot; Keiko sighed.

Ryouko had a amused look on her face as the space
pirate wiped down the bar. &quot;Come on.&quot; she sighed, &quot;we
all know those two can take care of themselves no
matter where they go.&quot;

&quot;Hell,&quot; the black haired accountant Nabiki Tendo
chimed in, &quot;even if they get themselves into trouble,
I&#39;d bet they&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

&quot;I guess you&#39;re right,&quot; Keiko conceded.

&quot;Of course I&#39;m right,&quot; Nabiki laughed.

&quot;Here&#39;s the last of the table cloths,&quot; Alpha said as
the green haired android finished bringing the dirty
linens to the wash hamper.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; May smiled brightly. &quot;And thank you for
agreeing to do some extra hours with Juri away,&quot; she
added.

&quot;Actually,&quot; Alpha smiled sweetly, &quot;I rather like it
here.&quot; Brightly she added, &quot;I get to meet so many
interesting people.&quot;

&quot;And get hit on regularly,&quot; Midori Sugiura noted, the
older woman still dressed in her flamboyant pink and
red waitress outfit. The redhead had joined the staff
recently, though everyone wondered how long she might
last.

&quot;Hit on?&quot; Alpha blinked, clearly not getting it.

&quot;Never mind,&quot; Midori waved it off.

Nabiki gave her a shrewd look, &quot;Midori, I have a
question.&quot; When the other woman looked at her
obediently she continued, &quot;How old are you, anyway?&quot;

&quot;Seventeen,&quot; Midori lied boldly.

&quot;Eh?&quot; several people reacted in disbelief to this.

&quot;Never mind,&quot; Minagi offered as Ryouko&#39;s twin finished
putting glasses away at the bar, &quot;if she says she&#39;s
seventeen, she&#39;s seventeen.&quot; A smirk, &quot;Ryouko and I
lie about our ages all the time, why shouldn&#39;t she?&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; Ryouko growled.

&quot;Uhh,&quot; Hyatt made a odd noise, the nearly blue faced
girl having collapsed bonelessly over a nearby table.

&quot;Does she always do that?&quot; Midori asked a bit
worriedly. &quot;I could always call my girlfriend Yohko
over to look at her...&quot;

&quot;No, she&#39;ll be fine,&quot; May reassured her.

&quot;All right, all done?&quot; Nabiki asked in a business like
way, sweeping the cleaned up bar, dance floor and
library with a critical eye.

&quot;I think we&#39;re fine,&quot; Keiko agreed.

&quot;Everyone, I hope you have a good evening,&quot; May said
sweetly as they all headed out, &quot;and I&#39;ll see you
tomorrow.&quot;

The group split up, some heading for vehicles while
others used more exotic methods to go home. Keiko
smiled as she opened the car door to her little
compact car then went around to the driver&#39;s side.
Climbing in herself she said, &quot;You&#39;re doing a good
job, love.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m trying,&quot; May smiled back, &quot;even though I&#39;m still
not sure it was a good idea of Juri&#39;s to put me in
charge while she was gone.&quot;

Pulling out onto the road Keiko drove carefully but
well into the night. &quot;You need to be more confident,&quot;
she said, &quot;everyone loves you there.&quot;

May actually blushed. &quot;Keiko, it&#39;s not that simple,&quot;
she said.

&quot;It can be,&quot; Keiko said as she reached out to
carefully squeeze May&#39;s hand.

May folded her hands over Keiko&#39;s, savoring the
warmth. &quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; she promised quietly as they
slowed in front of their apartment building.

&quot;You&#39;d better,&quot; Keiko winked impishly.</pre>
