------------------------------------------------

Ranma stared at the ceiling as he lay on his futon.  Ranko propped
herself up on her arms to look down at him while Akane read a book
on the other side of the futon.

Ranko:  &quot;You know, Ranma, I think Kyoko&#39;s in love with you.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;What?  You&#39;re kidding, right?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Oh, come on, Ranma.  Its only so obvious.&quot;

Ranma sat up, slightly pulling the covers off the others, causing them
to shiver as the colder air touched their bare skin.

Ranma:  &quot;No... what should I do?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;What do you mean?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;What should I do about Kyoko?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;That&#39;s what I asked.&quot;

Ranma was confused.  Akane put down her book and turned to face
him, reaching up with her hand to pull him back down onto the
futon.

Akane:  &quot;You don&#39;t have to do anything.  Kyoko will get over it.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;But what if she doesn&#39;t?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Even if she doesn&#39;t, that doesn&#39;t mean that anything&#39;s going
to happen.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;And even if it did, would that be so bad?&quot;

Ranma turned around to lie on his stomach.

Ranma:  &quot;That&#39;s not funny.&quot;

Ranko shifted her body until she lay on Ranma&#39;s back.

Ranko:  &quot;I know that you wanted to go off by yourself and Akane
once our training from mom stopped.  But the lovemaking is part of
our relationship now, and I don&#39;t want to give that up.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;What about Ryoga... and Shampoo?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I love Ryoga... and he&#39;s the only man I want to have
children with.  And I want to be with him and Shampoo for the rest
of my life.  Every night, if possible.  But that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t
love you or Akane or anyone else.  Or that I don&#39;t want to express that
love physically.&quot;

Akane joined Ranko, hugging her fiancee from behind.

Akane:  &quot;Ranma...  I guess I&#39;ve been thinking about this too.  Kasumi
and Nabiki and I have grown closer as well.  Our lovemaking has
become part of our relationship, just like it has for you and Ranko.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;You just want to sleep with other guys.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Sure, and what&#39;s wrong with that?  You get to sleep with
other girls.  But its only between us and the people we love.  Its not
like we&#39;re including Kodachi or Kuno or people we don&#39;t like.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;We said, if it came down to it, that we&#39;d choose to be
together exclusive of anyone else.  I still feel that way.  But I don&#39;t
know if I want to give up everyone else if we don&#39;t have to.  Do you,
Ranma?&quot;

Ranko squirreled under Ranma and kissed him on the lips.  He
sighed as he felt the two people closest to him start to cover him with
kisses.

Ranma:  &quot;I guess not.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I knew you couldn&#39;t give me up.  I&#39;m much better looking
than Akane.&quot;

Akane hit Ranko on the head.

Akane:  &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Well, just look at us.  C&#39;mon, Ranma...&quot;

Ranko pulled Ranma to a sitting position and sat on one of his legs,
having Akane sit on the other.

Ranko:  &quot;Whose tits would you rather suck on?  Someone with a great
tan or someone whose tits are still white because they hid behind a
one piece for the whole trip to the beach?  And mine are bigger, too.&quot;

Ranma found himself looking at what Ranko described.  Ranko had
used her topless time at the beach to her advantage and her breasts
were a luscious brown.  But Akane&#39;s were somehow just as luscious,
the whiteness of her untanned skin in contrast to her tanned
shoulders and face and legs.  He slowly lowered his face down to his
fiance&#39;s breast.

Ranko took hold of Ranma&#39;s manhood in her hand as he occupied
himself with Akane&#39;s nipple.  She stroked it until it reached its full
erect length, its warmth giving her a small thrill in itself.  It had been
some time since she had a man in her.  Ranko reached down to open
herself to her brother, her fingers splitting her pussy lips and guiding
his cock into her waiting entrance.

Ranko looked down and saw her red and his black pubic hair coming
closer together as he penetrated deeper into her body.  When they
finally joined together Ranko let her legs wrap around his torso and
her arms clasp around his neck as he started to kiss her neck.
Akane&#39;s hands massaged Ranko&#39;s breasts as she sandwiched Ranko
from behind.

Ranko started to move on Ranma&#39;s manhood, as much as her position
allowed.  The three lovers swayed as Ranko started to release onto
Ranma, making their joining slippery.  Akane rolled out of the way
as Ranma fell on top of Ranko.

Ranma&#39;s hips continued to move against Ranko&#39;s as he drove her
body into the floor.  Ranko moaned as Ranma let his cock almost slip
out of her before plunging it back into her soaked pussy.  Ranma
lifted his chest high above his sister, letting Akane slip between
them.

Akane greedily teased Ranko&#39;s nipples with her tongue, her hand
reaching to play with Ranko&#39;s clit.  Ranko let her orgasm build with
each thrust from Ranma, trying to hold onto her brother&#39;s cock as it
excited her with its warm presence and its force.  Ranko&#39;s pussy
started to spasm as her orgasm overtook her, Ranma stopping his
thrusts to let her just react to him being in her.

Ranma slowly pulled out of his sister as Akane continued to slowly
run her fingers over Ranko&#39;s clit.  Akane looked wistfully at the
glistening cock, reveling that the shaft -and the man behind it-
belonged to her.  Akane moved between Ranma and Ranko, offering
herself doggie-style to him.  Ranma smiled and took hold of her hips,
using his fingers to prepare her for his entry.  He eased his cock into
her wet womanhood, drawing her hips closer to his own.

Akane lowered her face and started to clean the juices that now ran
down Ranko&#39;s thighs.  Ranko pulled away so that she could position
herself under Akane, her face below the joining sexes.  Ranko let her
tongue and fingers play with Akane&#39;s clit and Ranma&#39;s shaft as they
moved above her.

Akane&#39;s tongue penetrated Ranko&#39;s folds, and Ranko locked her legs
around Akane&#39;s head.  Ranma took advantage of the opportunity to sit
back on his knees, pulling both Akane and Ranko up with him until
Akane&#39;s back touched his chest.  Akane ground her hips into Ranma
so that he remained fully within her at all times, rippling her pussy
muscles to keep stimulating her lover.  Ranko slowly unlocked her
legs so that she could slide down the front of Akane&#39;s body, letting
their hard nipples trace twin paths across each other.

Ranma&#39;s hands had already made their way to Akane&#39;s breasts,
holding her body close to his, so Ranko kissed Akane and ran her
hands down Akane&#39;s back and buttocks.

Akane:  &quot;Oh.  Ranma... don&#39;t come.&quot;

Akane&#39;s pussy muscles started to spasm around Ranma&#39;s cock as she
slowed her movements.  Akane reached back to hold Ranma&#39;s head in
her arms as she arched her back in pleasure.

Akane lifted herself of her lover&#39;s cock and took hold of his hand.
She led him to the window, motioning him to sit on the table with his
legs hanging out.  Akane then sat on one of his legs.  Ranko sat on
the other leg.  Ranma&#39;s manhood protruded between them.

Akane grabbed his manhood and started to masturbate him.  Ranko
joined her, intertwining their fingers on her brother&#39;s shaft.  Ranma
moaned as they started to speed up, their hands sliding on the coating
of their nectar.

Ranma&#39;s hands reached around to play with their clits, rubbing circles
in time with their strokes.  Their juices flowed down onto his thighs,
making it slippery as well.  Ranma&#39;s cock twitched as he reached his
orgasm, sending globules of sperm flying into the darkness.

The two girls didn&#39;t notice, both had closed their eyes as Ranma&#39;s
fingers again brought them closer to the release that he just achieved.
Ranma redoubled his efforts as he recovered, making sure that his
arms kept a tight grip on his two lovers.

Akane and Ranko turned toward each other, kissing and bringing
their hands to each other&#39;s breasts, spreading the wetness that Ranma
had poured on them across each other&#39;s body.  Ranma raised his legs
so that they could rub their pussies against them, and so that they
wouldn&#39;t slip out of the window.

Akane and Ranko orgasmed at the same time, their nectar pooling
under Ranma&#39;s ass on the desk.  Ranma continued his assault on their
clitorises as they came down from their high.  Akane and Ranko
signaled him to stop by bringing his hands up to their mouths and
licking them clean of their juices.  The three then lay back on the
desk, their legs still hanging out the window as the two girls
snuggled against Ranma&#39;s warm body.

Ranko:  &quot;How could you even think of giving me up?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Why did we go to the window?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;I wanted to see how far you could shoot.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;And...&quot;
Akane:  &quot;My eyes were closed.  Because somebody was doing me
while I was doing him.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Well?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;My eyes were closed, too.&quot;

**************

Ranko:  &quot;Isn&#39;t it ever going to stop raining?&quot;

It had rained every day since they returned from the beach, and
Ranko, like most of the other students of Furinkan High, was stuck at
school waiting for the rain to stop.  Ranma left early, but was
promptly waylaid right outside the Furinkan High Gates by a gang of
cats chasing something that suddenly included Ranma.

Nabiki:  &quot;Hey, Ranko... look who I found.&quot;

Nabiki brought out an unconscious Ryoga in his pig form.

Nabiki:  &quot;His stuff is in the nurse&#39;s office.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Why is he unconscious?&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;I guess I was holding him too close to certain parts of my
body.&quot;  [giggling]  &quot;At least he doesn&#39;t nosebleed anymore.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Yeah... thanks Nabiki.&quot;  [hugs Ryoga]
Nabiki:  &quot;So when is Shampoo coming back?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;This weekend.&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;And are you going to...&quot;  [indicating Ryoga] &quot;with her?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;We haven&#39;t talked about it yet.  I want to.&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;I know... just remember you&#39;ve always got us.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I know.&quot;

After making sure no one was around, the two kissed gently, then
separated.  Ranko went to the nurse&#39;s office to get Ryoga&#39;s backpack.
Since no one was there, she jumped onto one of the beds, lying back
and holding Ryoga above her.

Ranko:  &quot;What am I going to do with you, Ryoga?&quot;
Ryoga:  &quot;Bwee?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I mean, is it my fault I love you and Shampoo at the same
time?&quot;

Ranko lowered Ryoga onto the valley between her breasts and let go.

Ranko:  &quot;If you want to leave me again, then I won&#39;t stop you.&quot;

Ryoga looked down at the face of the red-headed pig-tailed girl below
him.  He had made love to her, but that was before he found out that
she loved someone else, another woman.

Ryoga slid down Ranko&#39;s shirt, eventually hitting her chin with his
nose.

Ranko:  &quot;Yuck!  Pig-kisses just don&#39;t cut it.  Let&#39;s go home.  And I&#39;ll
give you your reward later tonight.&quot;

**************

A horse ran through the streets of Nerima.  The people scattered in
front of it, since its rider was slumped unconscious in the saddle.
The rider had been unconscious for some time.

**************

Ranma couldn&#39;t understand why the gang of cats had decided to chase
him, but he wished they would stop.  His fear of them overrode any
other thoughts he had, and if he had been able to think, he would
have turned the other way from the cart carrying fresh fish just in
front of him.

If he had been able to notice such things, Ranma would have heard
the shouts warning him of a runaway horse coming from the
direction that he was running towards.  Ranma somewhat noticed the
horse when they ran into each other, but since the horse (and its
rider) flew backwards and landed unconscious in the street, Ranma
was much more preoccupied by the telephone pole that was behind it.

Ranma also fell unconscious to the street.  But then, so did the
telephone pole.

**************

Ranma woke as the sun came out of the clouds.  He remembered
leaving Furinkan High in his girl form because of the rain storm, and
immediately after leaving the gate he noticed the gang of cats that
chased him to wherever he was now.  The cats were no longer around
(having continued to follow the fishmonger).  Ranma sat up and
looked around, then noticed the unconscious man in the road.  Maybe
he would have some answers.

Ranma slapped him a couple of times.

Ranma:  &quot;Hey, you okay?  Wake up!&quot;

Sentaro Daimonji opened his eyes to a good-looking red-headed pig-
tailed girl.  Much better looking than his fiance, Miss Satsuki, who
reminded him of a monkey (but he wasn&#39;t quite sure of that, it being
unforgivably rude to tell your fiance that she had several more
evolutionary steps to reach humanity).

Sentaro opened his umbrella and set down a mat and his
accouterments.  He poured a small bowl of tea for his rescuer.

Sentaro:  &quot;Profoundest thanks for saving this one&#39;s life.  This tea must
be my unworthy gesture of gratitude.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Huh?  I didn&#39;t do anything to be thanking me for.&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;True, only prevented this lowly one&#39;s death.  I beg you
pathetically to taste of my gratitude.&quot;

Ranma thought the guy must have landed a little too hard when he
lost consciousness, but it would have been rude to refuse, so he took a
sip of the tea.  Ranma found himself losing control over his muscles
and fell to the ground.

Sentaro picked the girl up in his arms and placed her on his horse.
The spectators buzzed and whispered but made no move to stop him.

Sentaro:  &quot;Heh.  Heh.  A paralysis drug.  At last, at last, I have met a
woman of strength.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Whalla hell you tall alout?&quot;

**************

Akane and Ukyo walked toward to Tendo Dojo together, both
wearing rain gear but only Akane carrying an umbrella.  The sounds
of a galloping horse started to get louder.

Ukyo:  &quot;Thanks, Akane.  Don&#39;t want to be late starting dinner.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;That&#39;s okay, Kyoko.  Um, Kyoko...&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;Yeah, Akane?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Do you think it would be all right if I came in some days
and helped prepare a dish or two?&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;Sure, that would be great, if you really wanted to.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Thanks, Kyoko.  I knew I could count on you.&quot;

Ukyo wondered why Akane would even bother to make such a
request.  Was there something wrong with her cooking?  She would
have to remember to ask Ranko or Ranma about it later.

The sounds of the horse became even louder as it passed the two girls
on the street.  It was a little unusual seeing a horse in Nerima, so they
watched it go by.  Then they spotted the drugged figure lying
unconscious across the back of the horse.

Akane:  &quot;Ranma?&quot;

Akane threw her umbrella at the horse&#39;s rider.

Akane:  &quot;Hey!  Where are you going with Ranma?&quot;

Sentaro heard the shout behind him and saw the umbrella being
thrown.  He took out one of his tea-spoon darts and threw it,
snapping the umbrella in mid-air.  The dart embedded itself in the
pole next to Akane.  She looked at the dart.

Akane:  &quot;This is a tea ceremony spoon.  Who was that?&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;C&#39;mon, Akane, we have to go after them!&quot;
Akane:  &quot;No!  I&#39;ll go after them.  You have to go back home and cook
dinner.  That&#39;s your job.&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;What about Ranma?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Don&#39;t worry about Ranma.  I&#39;ll find him.  Tell everyone not
to worry if we don&#39;t make it back tonight.  We&#39;ll probably have to do
some fighting.  That&#39;s the way these things usually work out.&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;Are you sure, Akane?&quot;

Akane kissed Ukyo.

Akane:  &quot;It&#39;ll be okay.  I&#39;ll see you when we get back.&quot;

Akane winked at Ukyo, who remained standing in the street with a
startled expression on her face.

**************

Sentaro had the family servants stable his horse once he reached his
home.  Moving quickly, because the paralysis potion was due to wear
off, he carried Ranma into one of the spare rooms.  He got out the
family&#39;s wedding kimono.

Sentaro looked around to ensure no one was watching.  He started to
pull Ranma&#39;s wet shirt and pants off of the small, female body.
Amazed that there was no bra and that there were boxers instead of
panties, he couldn&#39;t resist the temptation, just to see what it felt like.

Sentaro&#39;s hand moved closer to Ranma&#39;s breast, ready to take hold of
it.  A small drop of drool escaped from his mouth.  The moment just
before he touched Ranma&#39;s skin was interrupted when Sentaro found
a fist in his face.

Sentaro found himself knocked backward and confused.  The
paralysis shouldn&#39;t have worn off yet.  Sentaro then looked at the
length of bare leg in front of him, deciding to give it another try.  His
hand moved to grab Ranma&#39;s ass.

Sentaro found himself being kicked in the stomach.  He decided to
leave Ranma alone.

**************

Ranko:  &quot;Hi, Kyoko.&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;Ranko!  Your brother just got kidnapped by some guy on a
horse!&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Oh.  Have you met Ryoga yet?&quot;

Ranko showed Ukyo a black pig with a yellow bandanna.

Ranko:  &quot;Isn&#39;t he so cute in his pig form?&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;Aren&#39;t you worried about Ranma?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Nah.  If he doesn&#39;t come back by tomorrow night then I&#39;ll go
out and look for him.  That&#39;s the way we&#39;ve always done it.  C&#39;mon,
lets go home.&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;But Ranma...&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Don&#39;t worry about him.  He can take care of himself.  Now,
c&#39;mon.&quot;

Ranko took hold of Ukyo&#39;s arm and started to lead her away.

Ranko:  &quot;Hey, Kyoko!  You want to see my boyfriend&#39;s cock?&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;Eeek!&quot;

Ryoga squirmed in Ranko&#39;s grasp, but to no avail.

Ranko:  &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid to look.  Anyway, its bigger when he&#39;s a guy,
and much bigger when its ready.&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;Ranko!&quot;

**************

A leaf landed on Ranma&#39;s face, tickling his nose.  He sneezed.

Ranma looked around and noticed that he was stripped down to his
boxers.  To one side was his clothes, laid out to dry, and a wedding
kimono hanging off in a corner on a rack.  Sentaro opened the sliding
door.

Sentaro:  &quot;Ah.  You have awakened.  I beg forgiveness for my
execrable rudeness.&quot;

Ranma kicked him in the face.

Ranma:  &quot;Who do you think you are?  I&#39;m gone.&quot;

Ranma quickly dressed and started to look for an exit.  Sentaro hung
onto Ranma&#39;s clothes as he was dragged along the ground.

Sentaro:  &quot;Please!  I grovel!  Hear me out!&quot;

An old woman with a bamboo whisk and tea bowl suddenly appeared
in front of a startled Ranma.

Old Woman:  &quot;Sentaro!  Have you kidnapped another girl again?&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;Grandmother!  She&#39;s not just another girl!  This is the girl
I will marry!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;What do you think you&#39;re talking about?&quot;

Ranma hit Sentaro off into the distance.  The old woman glided
across the floor in her sitting position.

Old Woman:  &quot;Now, it wasn&#39;t nice to do that to our only heir.&quot;

Ranma found his body flipping through the air, finally landing on his
back.  The old woman then hit him with a tea ceremony ladle.

Old woman:  &quot;Daimonji School of Martial Arts Striptease Tea
Ceremony.  The Napkin Strike.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Martial Arts Striptease Tea Ceremony?&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;Yes.&quot;

Sentaro led Ranma to one of the tea ceremony rooms.  Ranma noticed
that in addition to the sunken alcove for the tea-pot and its burner,
there was a aluminum bar that stretched to the ceiling, as well as
lights and speakers.

Sentaro:  &quot;I am the sole son and heir to the Daimonji School of
Martial Arts Striptease Tea Ceremony.  Now an arrangement has
been made to wed this worthless soul to another that a future heir
might be born.  Alas... the woman chosen I cannot bring my lowly
heart to like.&quot;

Ranma didn&#39;t feel any pity, but he did think Sentaro was a bit
pathetic.

Sentaro:  &quot;In order to nullify this arrangement I must find a woman
who can defeat my betrothed in a Martial Arts Striptease Tea
Ceremony.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Count me out of it!&quot;
Old Woman:  &quot;Ho. Ho. Ho.  Do you think a weakling like this could
possibly win a contest so demanding?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Listen, you old bat.  I, Ranma Saotome, have never lost any
Martial Arts Anything Contest!&quot;
Old Woman:  &quot;As you wish.  And if you win, you have my
permission to marry Sentaro.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Mmuh...&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;Oh, thank you!  Thank you so much!&quot;

Sentaro could already imagine taking hold of those breasts that were
denied him earlier.  He hugged Ranma, who hit him into the floor.

**************

Sentaro:  &quot;Please have a seat, Ranma.  I will educate you in the
Martial Arts Striptease Tea Ceremony.&quot;

Ranma touched the water in the pot.  It was just hot enough to trigger
the change.

Sentaro:  &quot;After you win this match, you will be my noble bride.  You
will be far more beautiful than my lowly self deserves.&quot;

Ranma dumped the hot water over himself, changing him back to his
male form.

Ranma:  &quot;And what if I don&#39;t fit the gown anymore?&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;Gyeeeeee?&quot;

Sentaro started to cry.

Ranma:  &quot;Oh, knock it off!&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;I thought I&#39;d finally found the woman to rescue me from
my deserved but horrid fate.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Just give up and marry the girl.&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;Only a man who does not know Satsuki could lacerate me
with such cruel words!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Satsuki?&quot;

The sounds of a fight drifted in from outside.

Akane:  &quot;Ranma!  I know you&#39;re here somewhere!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Akane!&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;This tea-ceremony spoon!  The one I carelessly dropped!&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Carelessly dropped?&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;You came all this way to return it to me?  You have my
gratitude!&quot;

Sentaro made to hug Akane.  Akane punched him under the chin
while Ranma kicked the back of his head.

**************

Akane:  &quot;You want me to take Ranma&#39;s place in the Martial Arts
Striptease Tea Ceremony?&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;Since this is to nullify my engagement, you wouldn&#39;t even
have to take off any of your clothes.  The art of striptease is given up
in favor of a simple contest of beating each other up.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Well... I do have some experience with the tea ceremony.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Do tell.&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;Yes, please tell me all about it.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;You don&#39;t mean you believe her.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Shut up, Ranma!  It so happens that Kasumi taught me
when I was little.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;So lets see you do it.&quot;

Sentaro watched as Akane spooned the tea into the bowl.  The tea
powder expanded into a small cloud while the tea jar fell onto the
floor.  Akane ladled the hot water into the bowl, overflowing the
sides with its impact.  Akane then whisked the tea into the hot water,
again causing the water to spill over the sides. Akane yelled in
frustration.

Ranma:  &quot;She&#39;s good, huh?&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;But she&#39;s just so... cute.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Back off, pal.  She&#39;s my wife!&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;Your wife.  Oh.&quot;

A plan started to form in Sentaro&#39;s mind.  Ranma still seemed willing
to fight for him in breaking the engagement.  And if he should just
happen to die...

**************

Nabiki knocked at Kyoko&#39;s door.

Ukyo:  &quot;Come in.&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Hi, Kyoko.  Are you busy right now?  Can I talk to you?&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;No, its okay, Nabiki.  What did you want to talk about?&quot;

Nabiki closed the sliding door behind her.  Ranko was watching TV
with Ryoga (in his pig form) trying not to arouse suspicion on the
part of their fathers, while Kasumi and Tofu were out on a date.
With the fathers playing shogi, that meant that they could talk
privately.  She knew that Nodoka considered them adults and would
not interfere unless she had to.

Ukyo sat on her futon, her school books on the floor.  Nabiki sat
down next to her.

Nabiki:  &quot;I was wondering how you liked your job... and how things
were going with your search for your fiancee.&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;Everything&#39;s fine, Nabiki.  I haven&#39;t finished my search yet.&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Have you ever given any thought to what you&#39;re going to do
after you find him?&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;... No, not really...&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;You know, Ukyo, you&#39;re really quite attractive.&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;Umm... thanks.&quot;

Ukyo was confused at trying to figure out where Nabiki was leading.
Then she realized that Nabiki had called her by her real name.  She
started to cry.  Nabiki pulled Ukyo&#39;s body closer and let her cry on her
shoulder.

Ukyo:  &quot;Does Ranma know?&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Nobody knows but me.  I won&#39;t tell the others if you don&#39;t
want me to.&quot;

Ukyo started to cry again.

Nabiki:  &quot;You know, Ukyo, Ranko&#39;s bisexual.  I am too.  I guess that&#39;s
why I came here tonight.&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;What do you mean?&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;I like you, Ukyo.&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;I don&#39;t... I mean, I never...&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;You mean you haven&#39;t thought about Ranma as Ranko?&quot;

Ukyo blushed.  She had.

Nabiki:  &quot;There&#39;s no shame in looking for people to love.  Even if its
just for a little while.&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;I don&#39;t know... I mean I never thought about it before...&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Ukyo.  Shhh.&quot;  [pulling away from Ukyo and placing a
finger on her lips]  &quot;You know what I&#39;m saying.  I guess I&#39;ll go up to
my room.  It would be nice if someone wanted to join me.&quot;

**************

Ryoga was trapped between the floor and Ranko&#39;s breasts as she
watched TV, which wasn&#39;t exactly horrible, but was extremely hot.
Ranko finally sat up.

Ranko:  &quot;Guess I&#39;ll take a bath and then go to bed.  Goodnight, Mr.
Tendo.  Goodnight, Pop.&quot;

The two fathers grunted their acknowledgment, not looking up from
their shogi board.  Ranko opened the door to the bathroom and placed
Ryoga in the small clothes bin, letting him watch as she slowly
stripped off her clothes and underwear.  Ranko then reached over to
slip Ryoga&#39;s bandanna over his head.

Ranko closed the inner door behind them and dumped cold water on
both of their forms, then quickly followed it with hot water, since
neither of them was interested in staying in their cursed forms for
long.

Ryoga:  &quot;Hey!&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Shhh!  Remember the last time we took a bath together?
You ran out on me.  That&#39;s not going to happen this time.&quot;

Ranko sat Ryoga down on the tile floor and began to lather his chest
while sitting on his legs.  Ryoga couldn&#39;t help reacting to her actions,
his manhood bridging the distance between them.  Ranko smiled as
she felt his member grow until it bumped her pussy lips.  Both Ryoga
and her brother were about the same size.

Ranko re-lathered the washcloth with soap and brought it down to the
flesh between them.  Ryoga gulped as Ranko grabbed his manhood
through the washcloth.  Ranko slowly cleaned Ryoga, always
returning to the hard cock, always running the washcloth once up and
down its length before moving on to another part of his body.

Ryoga thought he would go crazy or explode if Ranko&#39;s treatment
went on much longer.  Ranko washed away the soap with warm
water.  She came in close to kiss Ryoga on the mouth, and Ryoga
could feel her thighs slowly hug his manhood between them.  Ranko
slowly slid down his body, his cock traveling along her slit, then
belly, then between her breasts, then finally poking free into the air
for a second before it was enveloped in Ranko&#39;s mouth.

Ryoga felt Ranko&#39;s lips surrounding his cock as they transversed its
length, her fingers playing with his scrotum as she tried to bring forth
the explosion that he had held back.

Ryoga:  &quot;Ranko, I&#39;m gonna cum!&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Do it!  Cum for me.&quot;

Ranko found that her words didn&#39;t quite make it out of her mouth
clearly, Ryoga&#39;s cock prevented that.  But suddenly he was lifting his
hips, trying to go even deeper into her mouth.  His hot cum spurted
into her mouth as she swallowed it all.

Ryoga looked down to see Ranko smiling at him over his shrinking
manhood.  She put it once more into her mouth and ran her tongue
over it to give it one last cleaning, then stood up in front of him,
letting him take in the sight of her body.  He stood up next to her and
took her into her arms.

Nodoka:  &quot;Ranko?  I&#39;m coming in.&quot;

Ryoga almost yelped in shame and surprise, except that Ranko
clapped her hand over his mouth.  Nodoka entered the bathroom, also
naked.  She looked unsurprised at the sight of her daughter nude with
another boy.  Ranko released Ryoga&#39;s mouth.

Nodoka:  &quot;Have you two been having a good time?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Yes, mom.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Good.  Why don&#39;t the two of you soak in the furo and I&#39;ll
join you after I wash up.&quot;

Ranko dumped another load of water on herself and Ryoga to ensure
they were clean of their lovemaking, then led him into the furo.
Ryoga sat down, and Ranko sat next to him, laying her head on his
chest.  Ryoga felt extremely uncomfortable at the display of affection,
but liked having Ranko next to him.  However, the sight of her body
and the feeling of her skin against his was causing another erection.
Ranko just smiled and moved so that she sat in front of him, trapping
his cock in between her cheeks.  She took hold of his hands and
brought them around to hug her waist.

Nodoka:  &quot;No fucking in the furo, dear.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Yes, mom.&quot;

Nodoka smiled at her daughter and stepped into the tub on the
opposite side of the other two.  The sight of Nodoka didn&#39;t help ease
Ryoga&#39;s erection.

Nodoka:  &quot;Now then.  Ryoga.  Its obvious I know all about you and
my daughter and Shampoo.&quot;
Ryoga:  &quot;Urk?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Now, as Ranko knows, I won&#39;t do anything to stop you
young adults from the things you do.  But I will be forced to take
action were the information to become public knowledge, and that
includes my husband or Mr. Tendo, do you understand?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I&#39;ll explain it to him, mother.  He knows some of it already.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;That&#39;s fine, dear.  Now, the two of you give me a kiss, and
I believe that you can sneak up to your room without getting dressed.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Thanks, mom.&quot;

Ranko moved to kiss Nodoka lightly on the cheek and got out of the
tub.  Ryoga did the same, though he was more embarrassed about it.
In the dressing room Ranko took her time in drying them both,
giving Ryoga another erection.

Ranko looked out the door to make sure the coast was clear.  She then
took Ryoga by the hand, and carrying their clothes, led him up the
stairs to her room.

**************

Ranma was a little uncomfortable dressed in the formal kimono.  He
sat in his girl form with his legs tucked under him on one of the lines
on the floor of the room (actually the edges of two floor mats).

Sentaro:  &quot;The Martial Arts Striptease Tea Ceremony is found upon
sitting.  All fighting and stripping is done from the proper sitting
position.  If you are ready... follow me.&quot;

Sentaro glided across the long hallway while remaining in a sitting
position.  Ranma caught up to him by using his hands.

Sentaro:  &quot;It is unwise to run with your hands.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Shut up!  I&#39;m keeping up with you, aren&#39;t I?&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;Yes, quite true, but if you cannot use your hands when you
need them it could be painful!&quot;

Sentaro hit Ranma with a water ladle.

Ranma:  &quot;Hey, what whazzat for?&quot;  [getting up]
Sentaro:  &quot;Remain properly seated!&quot;

Sentaro hit Ranma on the head with a water pot.

Old Woman:  &quot;Ho Ho Ho!  The clumsy girl can&#39;t even sit correctly!
Do you truly believe you can defeat Miss Satsuki in tomorrow&#39;s
match?&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;Tomorrow?&quot;
Old Woman:  &quot;I have just received word that the match is to be
tomorrow.  Miss Satsuki is said to be a master of the Martial Arts
Striptease Tea Ceremony.  Do you really believe your Miss Clumsy
has a chance?  I will look forward to this match.  Ho Ho!&quot;

The old woman glided upside down across one of the ceiling bamboo
supports, her toes clutching the bamboo, pushing her upright body
along its length.  Ranma watched her move and figured out that
Sentaro&#39;s &quot;gliding&quot; was really just running while sitting, but only
using the feet to move.  He also figured out the Sentaro really sucked
as a teacher.

Sentaro:  &quot;You must train!  Train until you drop!&quot;

**************

Sentaro:  &quot;Idiot!  That&#39;s not what I thought you!&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;You call yourself a man?&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;You fool!  You fool!&quot;

Ranma kicked Sentaro.

Ranma:  &quot;Enough is enough!&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;Kicking is not permitted!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Ever since you found out I was a guy you&#39;ve been laying
into me!  I&#39;m sick of it!&quot;

Ranma started to fight Sentaro.  Akane yawned.

**************

Ukyo knocked on Nabiki&#39;s door.

Nabiki:  &quot;Come in.&quot;

Ukyo opened the door and entered the room.  Nabiki finished putting
away her schoolbooks on her desk while Ukyo sat down on the bed.
They looked at each other.

Nabiki:  &quot;Well, Ukyo?&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;I still don&#39;t know, Nabiki...&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;I know.  You&#39;re still in love with Ranma.&quot;
Ukyo:  [stricken]  &quot;Does Ranma know?&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Probably.  Come on, Ukyo.  All us girls have seen how you
act around Ranma.&quot;

Ukyo hung her head down.  She didn&#39;t know what to do.  Nabiki
leaned in close to Ukyo.

Nabiki:  &quot;The question is what do you want?  Do you want to be with
me and Mousse when he comes back?  I&#39;m sure I can arrange that.
        Do you want Ranma?  Well, I don&#39;t know how Akane feels
about that.  I know they both like you.  So.  Do.  I.&quot;

Ukyo looked up to find Nabiki&#39;s face in front of hers, ready to kiss
her.  Ukyo let Nabiki kiss her, letting the weight of the other girl
drive her backward onto the bed.  It was nice.  Just as nice as Akane&#39;s
kiss earlier.

Nabiki released the kiss and they looked at each other.

Ukyo:  &quot;What now?&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Whatever you want.&quot;

Nabiki got off of Ukyo and removed her t-shirt from her body, and
followed it by unclasping her bra and throwing it onto the floor.
Ukyo watched silently as Nabiki then slid out of her shorts and
panties.  She had seen Nabiki (and the others) naked before, but it
never had this impact on her.  Nabiki went to her nightstand and got
her present from Nodoka.

Nodoka had ordered vibrators for Nabiki, Akane, and Ranko,
figuring that since they were all adults now, they should have the
same as Kasumi&#39;s &quot;graduation gift&quot;.  She ran her finger over her
engraved name, then turned back toward the bed.  Ukyo was still
dressed.

Nabiki:  &quot;Did you just come here for a show, Ukyo?&quot;

Ukyo flushed in embarrassment at Nabiki&#39;s smile.  She had been so
occupied watching Nabiki she hadn&#39;t done anything else.  She slipped
out of her sweatshirt and sweatpants (she hadn&#39;t worn anything else),
and let her hair loose, letting it flow down across her shoulders.

Nabiki put her vibrator down to one side for a moment, and hugged
Ukyo.  Nabiki was purposeful in letting their nipples play with each
other, slipping her leg between Ukyo&#39;s and rubbing it against the
other&#39;s sex.  Ukyo returned the favor.

Nabiki pushed Ukyo back onto the headboard, cushioning her body
with the pillows, instructing her to watch.  Nabiki moved back and
stood on her knees, spreading them apart on opposite sides of Ukyo&#39;s
legs beneath her.  Nabiki&#39;s hand moved to her nipples.

First pinching them, then pulling them.  Making them hard with her
excitement.  Nabiki gently ran her hands over her breasts, cupping
them, stimulating them, then running her hands down the sides of
her body.  Ukyo watched breathless, until Nabiki had Ukyo&#39;s hands
mirror her own.  Nabiki ran a finger along her slit, opening herself
and knowing that part of her was silhouetted for Ukyo.

Nabiki touched her clit and shuddered.  She felt the first drop of her
lubrication in her pussy.  Nabiki took up her vibrator and licked it,
moistening it with her saliva.  Knowing her actions were clearly
silhouetted against the desk lamp, she reached down and slowly
inserted her gift into herself.

She could feel her pussy lips separate for her intruder.  She took
Ukyo&#39;s hands and let her move it further into her.  Ukyo breathlessly
inserted the vibrator until it almost disappeared into Nabiki, then
turned it on.  Nabiki groaned as her legs went weak and she fell
forward, catching herself on the headboard above Ukyo.

Nabiki&#39;s hips swayed in midair as she simulated fucking a real man.
Ukyo matched Nabiki&#39;s rhythm as she withdrew and worked the
vibrator back into Nabiki&#39;s pussy.  Ukyo thought that all of her
Marital Arts training had not prepared her for this; a real, writhing,
responsive lover in front of her.

Nabiki:  &quot;My... my tits.&quot;

Ukyo saw the swinging breasts in front of her.  Slipping the vibrator
all the way into Nabiki, Ukyo raised her face to the hard buds and
took one into her mouth.

Nabiki&#39;s back arched and her front pressed against Ukyo&#39;s as she
came.  Ukyo&#39;s hand holding the vibrator became coated with Nabiki&#39;s
ambrosia as the wetness flowed from her body.  Nabiki stopped her
hip movements after awhile, though she was still pressed her body
against Ukyo.

Nabiki:  &quot;Mmm... take it out of me.  Its your turn now.&quot;

Nabiki rolled off of Ukyo and they both looked at the glistening tool
left in Ukyo&#39;s hand.  Nabiki smeared its juices across Ukyo&#39;s breasts
and brought her tongue to follow its journey from nipple to nipple,
then brought Ukyo&#39;s wet fingers up to her mouth.  Nabiki smiled at
Ukyo and started to clean Ukyo&#39;s soaked hand one finger at a time,
taking each finger into her mouth and slowly drawing it back out.
Ukyo shuddered as Nabiki brought Ukyo&#39;s hand to her own mouth
and she first tasted Nabiki&#39;s cum.  She never thought she would want
it so much as she cleaned it of Nabiki&#39;s remaining cum.

Nabiki lay on bed and pulled Ukyo onto her, both laying on their
backs.  Nabiki spread her legs and opened her sex to the air, pulling
Ukyo&#39;s legs open at the same time.  Ukyo gasped as Nabiki took her
hand and they both slipped the vibrator into her wet pussy.  Ukyo
fantasized that it was Ranma that was entering her, Ranma that lay
above her and slowly entered her inch after glorious inch until he
could go no further.  Nabiki turned the vibrator on and started to
drive it into Ukyo the way Nabiki liked to be fucked:  hard and fast.

Ukyo bucked her hips as she neared her orgasm, bouncing Nabiki
deeper into her bed.  Nabiki used her free hand to hold onto Ukyo&#39;s
stomach as she continued her relentless assault on her sex.

Ukyo:  &quot;Oh!  Ran-chan!&quot;

Ukyo came powerfully, much stronger than any she had reached by
herself.  Nabiki almost laughed as Ukyo&#39;s hair flew into her face with
Ukyo&#39;s head snapping from side to side uncontrollably.  Nabiki
turned off the vibrator and left it in Ukyo as she played with her clit.
Nabiki continued to hug Ukyo from below as she recovered from her
orgasm, kissing her shoulder and neck lovingly.

Ukyo:  &quot;Nabiki... I&#39;m sorry.&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;For what, for being in love with Ranma?&quot;

Nabiki removed the vibrator from Ukyo&#39;s pussy and brought it up to
their faces, letting Ukyo taste her juices before having a taste herself.
Nabiki put the vibrator aside on the nightstand and Ukyo slid down
next to her.

Nabiki:  &quot;You don&#39;t have to be sorry about that.  I&#39;m a little in love
with him myself.&quot;

Nabiki kissed Ukyo as they moved against each other, letting their
legs intertwine as their hands ran across each other&#39;s backs.

Nabiki:  &quot;Well?&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;Nabiki?&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Was that enough for you?  Or do you want to go further?&quot;

Nabiki brought her hands up to bring strands of Ukyo&#39;s hair to lie
across her breasts, cupping them in her palm and letting the hair roll
across the sensitive flesh.  Ukyo&#39;s hands took hold of Nabiki&#39;s
buttocks and brought their hips together.  Ukyo rolled over so that she
was the one entrapping the other, kissing Nabiki and letting her leg
press against Nabiki&#39;s womanhood.

Ukyo slowly moved so that they faced each other&#39;s sex.  Ukyo felt
Nabiki&#39;s finger&#39;s open her pussy lips, and felt a tongue slowly slip into
her.  She returned the favor.  Ukyo thought that perhaps she would
surprise Nabiki and give her a little more pleasure in gratitude for her
loving friendship.

Ukyo started to perform the Flutter Tongue.  Nabiki, knowing only
that a Marital Arts technique was being used on her, matched the
action.

**************

Ryoga lay next to Ranko on her bed.  With her coaching, he had
brought her to orgasm countless times.  He felt a deep satisfaction
that he could give a woman so much pleasure.  Gone was the self-
doubt and shyness that had always come between him and any girl he
had asked out.

Ranko smiled at her lover above her.  She could feel his manhood,
excited and erect against her leg.  It was time to give him his reward
for being such a good student.

Ranko:  &quot;How do you want me?&quot;

Even with his familiarity with Ranko&#39;s body, Ryoga almost fainted.
They had made love earlier in the evening and then Ranko had
taught him the arts of pleasure.  Ranko wanted to do something new
and different for him.

Ranko:  &quot;I know what you&#39;ll like.&quot;

Ranko sat Ryoga on the edge of her bed and knelt before him.  She
took him into her mouth, letting her tongue run over the engorged
member, coating it with her saliva.  When he was wet enough, she
removed her mouth and moved a little closer to the bed.  Ryoga&#39;s
cock stuck out in the air and pointed to the valley between her
breasts.

Ranko pushed her breasts together and trapped him between them.
She started to move her body, letting him fuck her breasts.  His penis
poked through the top of her breasts.  She gave it a little lick with her
tongue.

Ryoga leaned back as Ranko continued.  The pleasuring he gave
Ranko had excited him too much and he knew he couldn&#39;t hold back
for long.  He didn&#39;t.

His cock twitched between Ranko&#39;s breasts and Ranko knew he was
coming.  Load after load of Ryoga&#39;s cum flew into the air, landing on
top of Ranko&#39;s face and breasts.  Ryoga looked down and her and
thought he should be disgusted.  But he still found her beautiful.

Ranko had Ryoga slip under the bedsheets as she cleaned herself up,
then joined him in an embrace.  Their bodies melded against each
other and they were soon asleep, happy to be with the other.

**************

Nodoka switched between the channels of her video system.

Ranma and Akane&#39;s room was empty.  She was a little worried about
Ranma, but knew that her son could take care of himself.  She also
trusted Akane to find him.  She wished that they could have called to
tell her that everything was all right, but knew as martial artists that
was sometimes impossible.

Ranko was with Ryoga.  She wondered how that relationship would
work out once Shampoo came back to Nerima.  Probably what she
and Kimiko had always hoped would happen between them and their
husbands, knowing their enthusiasm.  Even though she was her
daughter, Nodoka resisted the urge to interfere or to help Ranko.
This was part of what being a woman and a marital artist was about.

Ukyo was with Nabiki.  Nodoka knew that Ukyo was still in love with
Ranma.  She also knew about Ukyo&#39;s Marital Arts School.  And about
Nabiki&#39;s background search and that Nabiki didn&#39;t know about that
final piece of information.  But she had resolved to let the children
handle the situation on their own, no matter what happened, because
dealing with the other schools was also part of being a marital artist.
She and Kimiko had become lovers.  But their choice was not a
common one.

Kasumi and Tofu were already asleep, tired from his dinner function.

Nodoka set her VCR&#39;s to record the input from Ranko and Nabiki&#39;s
room and let her electronics move back to their hidden wall and floor
sockets.  Genma burst through the sliding door.

Genma:  &quot;Nodoka!  I have prevailed once again against Tendo.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;That&#39;s nice, dearest.  Did you cheat?&quot;
Genma:  &quot;No!  And that makes it even more special!  I wish to spread
my good cheer!&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Yes, dear.&quot;

Nodoka once again slipped into the demeanor of the (slightly more
than) dutiful wife, slipping her clothes off and kneeling to untie her
husband&#39;s pants.  Genma suddenly pushed her away and brought his
face down to her sex, surprising Nodoka, who happily accepted his
ministrations.  When Genma was like this she knew that there&#39;d be
no sleep for her that night.

**************

Ukyo and Nabiki had finished their orgasms and looked at each other
in confusion.  The fact that the other was a Marital Artist had
shocked them both.  They were unsure of how to react to each other.

Theoretically, there&#39;d be a duel between them, and the loser would be
forced to abandon her school or die.  The rules were simple; the one
who outlasted the other was the winner.  The one that eventually gave
up or lost consciousness was the loser.

Nabiki sighed.  She didn&#39;t want any of this.  She wanted a friend to
become something more, even if that friend eventually ended up with
Ranma because she loved him.

Nabiki lay back on her bed and spread her arms to Ukyo.

Nabiki:  &quot;Friends forever?&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;Forever.&quot;

Ukyo dove into Nabiki&#39;s embrace and the two of them eventually fell
asleep, small tears falling from both of their eyes.  They knew they
would have to deal with their families&#39; problems, but that could wait
for a later time.

**************

Sentaro:  &quot;You have m... mastered the techniques of the m...mmm...
you know.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Heh.  Showed you, didn&#39;t I?&quot;

Sentaro led Ranma and Akane to the Striptease Tea Ceremony
Tournament site.

Akane:  &quot;By the way... what kind of girl is this &#39;Miss Satsuki&#39;
anyway?&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;She is the daughter of the Miyakoji School of Martial Arts
Striptease Tea Ceremonies.  She was also -ahem- Miss Tea Ceremony
for 1993.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;She must have a horrible personality.&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;Well, in truth, she&#39;s very bright and sociable.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;What?  So how come you don&#39;t like her?&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;Meet Miss Satsuki.&quot;

Sentaro opened the door to the tea house.  Inside was the typical tea
ceremony decor, with two aluminum dance poles attached to the floor
and ceiling.

Ranma:  &quot;A monkey?&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;My unworthy heart simply can&#39;t seem to warm up to her.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding.  I&#39;m outta here!&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;But you can&#39;t!  You&#39;ve come this far!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Like hell I can&#39;t.  Me!  Ranma!  Fighting a monkey!&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;Then she is a monkey!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;You had doubts?  How sociable is a person who goes &#39;ik, ik,
ik&#39; anyway?&quot;
Old Woman:  &quot;So our Miss Clumsy gives up on winning Sentaro&#39;s
hand?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Ha.  You two are made for each other.  I hope you&#39;ll be very
happy.&quot;  [putting Sentaro&#39;s hand in the monkey&#39;s]  &quot;Invite me to the
wedding.  Just don&#39;t invite me to the honeymoon - it&#39;ll probably be
illegal.&quot;

Ranma turned around to leave and was immediately hit in the back of
the head by a water pot.  He turned around again and the monkey
scoured his face with the tea whisk.

Monkey:  &quot;Eep!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;You&#39;re dead, furball!&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;Oh, Ranma!  Then you will fight for me!&quot;
Old Woman:  &quot;In accordance with the rules, you will adopt the sitting
position!&quot;

The old woman threw a scarf at Ranma, wrapping his legs in the
sitting position.  Ranma threw a brace of tea spoon darts at the
monkey.  The monkey dodged and threw a packet at Ranma, which
burst and sent tea powder into Ranma&#39;s eyes.

Sentaro:  &quot;The Tea-Powder Mist technique!  Followed by the Pot-
Strike!  What a double whammy!&quot;

Ranma hit the monkey with the same tea-pot.

Ranma:  &quot;Pot Counter-Strike!  Ladle-Strike!&quot;

Ranma unwrapped the obi from around his waist and caught one of
the dance poles with it.  Ranma tore off the pole from its housing and
sent it flying at the monkey.

Ranma:  &quot;Dance Pole Helicopter Strike!&quot;

The monkey dodged the spinning pole, which hit Sentaro in the head.
The monkey took off one of its fishnet gloves and caught Ranma&#39;s
foot with it, throwing Ranma and wrapping him against the
remaining dance pole.  Ranma took his obi and flew it at the monkey,
wrapping its face with cloth layers to occupy it while he freed
himself.

Old Woman:  &quot;This Miss Clumsy isn&#39;t so bad after all.  She holds her
own against Miss Satsuki&#39;s best moves.  With this much skill she
proves herself a worthy bride for you, Sentaro.  What do you think?
Well, Sentaro?&quot;

The old woman looked around, but Sentaro and Akane had already
walked outside.

Akane:  &quot;But why in the world are you engaged to a monkey?&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;I have no idea.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;What do you mean, no idea?&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;Putting that aside.  You realize that if both Ranma and
Miss Satsuki are fatally wounded in this battle no one would stand in
the way of our marriage!&quot;
Akane:  &quot;You can&#39;t be serious.&quot;

Ranma burst through the roof to land on Sentaro&#39;s head.

Ranma:  &quot;So, it all comes clear now!&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;Whatever do you mean?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Let&#39;s go home, Ranma.&quot;

The monkey burst through the wall and hit Ranma in the back of the
head with a tea-pot, also hitting Sentaro with its knees.  Ranma
started to chase the monkey again.

Ranma:  &quot;Get back here, you flea picker!&quot;

Ranma threw a ladle at the branch the monkey hung from.  The
branch snapped and the monkey fell to the ground.  Ranma threw
some tea-spoon darts at it, pinning it to the trunk of a tree.

Akane:  &quot;Ranma!  Let&#39;s go home!&quot;

Akane took hold of Ranma before he could attack the monkey again.

Akane:  &quot;C&#39;mon Ranma.  You&#39;ve won.  Now let&#39;s go and I&#39;ll forgive
you for calling me a klutz.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Grr.&quot;

Akane licked Ranma&#39;s ear, then turned him around and kissed him,
letting her hands rest on his ass.  The two of them started to leave the
building.  Sentaro followed them after recovering from his nosebleed
from seeing two girls kiss each other.

Sentaro:  &quot;Please don&#39;t leave.  You haven&#39;t won yet!&quot;

A horse carrying a girl ran into Sentaro, knocking all three to the
ground.

Sentaro:  &quot;Are you all right?&quot;
Girl:  &quot;What?&quot;

The monkey slipped out of its kimono and ran toward the girl.

Girl:  &quot;Oh, poor Sanae!  I&#39;m so sorry!  I&#39;m sorry I asked you to take
my place, Sanae!  It must have been terrible for you!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Take her place?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Then... you must be the real Miss Satsuki!&quot;
Satsuki:  &quot;I am.&quot;
Old Woman:  &quot;And just how did this odd circumstance come to be,
dear?&quot;
Satsuki:  &quot;Well... I was so looking forward to meeting my future
husband, but when the day finally came, I was just so embarrassed!&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;How demure and maidenly of you!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;You thought it less embarrassing to have people think you
were a monkey?&quot;

**************

Ranma and Akane sat at the dinner table with everyone else.  Ryoga&#39;s
blood boiled.  Here was his chance to finally finish his fight with
Ranma.

Ryoga:  &quot;Ranma, I challenge you!&quot;

Ryoga charged Ranma.  Ranma flipped him out the door with a
napkin.  Ryoga got up and charged again.  Ranma hit him in the
head with a hot water pot.  Ryoga charged again, this time getting
knocked over the dojo wall by the sweet spot of a tea-ladle.

Akane:  &quot;Ranma.  Are you two fighting again?  Honestly.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;What can I do?  He keeps attacking me for no reason.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I hope he comes back soon.

**************

Kasumi:  &quot;Mail for you, Ranma.&quot;

Kasumi handed a letter to Ranma.

Akane:  &quot;Who&#39;s it from?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Its from that Tea Ceremony guy.  Dear Ranma, I thank you
for the undeserved joy that this lowly one now relishes.  We will
probably never meet again...&quot;
Sentaro:  &quot;Or so I thought.  But isn&#39;t fate miraculous?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Get offa my head!&quot;

Ranma hit the horse&#39;s hoof, knocking the horse onto its back.

**************

Ranma thought to himself that Satsuki was much more than that
backstabber Sentaro deserved.  He had a short vision then, of himself
and Akane taking Satsuki up to their bedroom and making love to
her in front of a captive Sentaro.

Then when Sentaro made love to her, Satsuki would reply:

Satsuki:  &quot;Is that it?  I want more!&quot;

Ranma laughed to himself and discarded the idea.  It wouldn&#39;t be
honorable.  Besides, he could never get away with it.  Sentaro and
Satsuki were soon conscious and galloped away from the dojo.

**************

Satsuki lay on her honeymoon bed with her husband.  They had spent
the night discovering each other physically and it had culminated
with their joining.  Sentaro caught his breath as he lay on top of his
wife.

Satsuki:  &quot;Is that it?  I want more!&quot;

Sentaro groaned in exhaustion.  Maybe marriage hadn&#39;t been such a
good thing after all.
