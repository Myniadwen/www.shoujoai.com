<h1>Black Rose, Blue Thunder (part 7 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/blakrose-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Lightning struck Ranma for the fiftieth time.

Observing the charred and smoking form of her one and only, 
Kodachi said hesitantly, &quot;Ranma dearest... perhaps you should 
refrain from trying to remove the amulet. It seems to be outfitted 
with some sort of protection device.&quot;

For a response, Ranma fell forward and was immediately caught by 
Kodachi. Moaning slightly, the blonde elf buried her face in her 
companion&#39;s neck.

&quot;Darling,&quot; said Kodachi in a tender endearment as she pressed her 
lips against Ranma&#39;s soft hair. &quot;Will you now stop your attempts 
to remove that accursed amulet?&quot;

When Ranma didn&#39;t reply, Kodachi pulled away and saw that the 
blonde had passed out from her exertions. With a sigh, Kodachi 
gently pushed some stray strands of hair out of Ranma&#39;s eyeline. 
Then in a smooth movement, Kodachi lifted the other girl and held 
her against her back.

As she made her way out of the building and gave Ranma a piggy 
back ride home, Kodachi murmured, &quot;It&#39;s odd. I never thought I&#39;d 
ever be unhappy because of jewelry.&quot;

Whatever Cologne had done to Ranma by giving her the amulet, 
Kodachi would have to find some way to undo it. Because if she 
knew her beloved, as soon as Ranma woke up the first thing that 
she&#39;d try to do would be removing the amulet again.

And Kodachi really didn&#39;t want to see Ranma get struck by lightning 
for the fifty-first time.

-------------------------------------------------

&quot;Bye everyone!&quot; said Akane as she waved at her soccer teammates 
enthusiastically. &quot;See you later!&quot;

&quot;Bye, Captain Akane-chan!&quot;

&quot;Take care, Captain Akane!&quot;

&quot;Return soon, Captain Tendo!&quot;

&quot;We love you, Captain!&quot;

Smiling at all her teammates shouts, Akane turned on her heel 
and took off in a cloud of dust. In a blurring run, she headed 
back towards the Tendo dojo.

As she ran, Akane focused on reviewing the details of today&#39;s 
soccer practice. They had defeated Tomobiki in the practice match 
but only by a hundred and seven points. That was one of their 
lowest victory margins. She was definitely going to have to 
increase the number of practices for the team.

Akane was still contemplating this when she heard the thundering 
sound of footsteps. That&#39;s when she saw a blurred figure run past 
her followed by about fifty or so guys that she recognized as 
Furinkan High students.

Puzzling over this, Akane came to a halt and watched their 
departure as she listened to the boys shouts.

&quot;Come back, Chocolate!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be mad at us for wanting to lick you!&quot;

&quot;Or eat your milky goodness!&#39;

&quot;Chocolate, let us see your tasty filling!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re our new goddess!&quot;

Blinking as she watched the boys run off, Akane had a vague 
feeling of deja vu and hoped that this Chocolate person they 
were pursuing knew how to handle mobs of over zealous and 
worshipping guys like she did.

With a shrug, Akane started her run back to the Tendo dojo. As 
she went, her mind focused on other things. Namely her sister, 
Nabiki, and how she was getting along with her new iinazuke, 
Ryoga.

Akane felt somewhat guilty about how she dealt with the new 
engagement but hoped that Nabiki would take this as a chance to 
get close to a boy. Besides, Ryoga seemed like a nice person even 
if he was a bit shy for Akane&#39;s tastes.

Then again, it&#39;d been quite awhile since Akane had a real boyfriend 
or girlfriend. Being far too busy with her sports teams and 
training for them to have one.

&quot;I wish that I could meet someone nice,&quot; Akane said quietly to 
himself. &quot;Someone that can understand about my fans.&quot;

Giving another sigh, Akane rounded the corner and heard the sound 
of a car coming to a screeching halt. Akane paused to look around 
and that was when a figure suddenly came falling out of the sky 
and right towards her.

Her light brown eyes going wide, Akane barely had time to take 
in the figure that was nearing her when it fell into her arms. 
The impact was so strong that Akane found herself falling back 
and onto the ground.

&quot;Jeez,&quot; Akane shook her head. &quot;What was that--&quot;

Halting her speech, Akane looked at the figure in her arms with 
wide eyes. It was an utterly gorgeous girl with long black hair 
and sculptured features. The girl was passed out but was taking 
even and steady breaths.

&quot;I better take her to the hospital,&quot; murmured Akane as she slowly 
rose to her feet.

Cradling the girl gently in her arms, Akane took off in another 
run but this time was headed for the nearest hospital to get the 
girl some medical aid.

As she went, Akane couldn&#39;t help but look down at the girl and 
admire her stunning looks. She hadn&#39;t ever seen anyone as beautiful 
as the girl that she was holding.

Looking at her gave Akane another feeling of deja vu.

But why?

------------------------------------------------

&quot;Japanese are very strange,&quot; Perfume noted.

She was observing, with some humor, as Genma and Soun proceeded 
to get themselves plastered on a seemingly endless supply of sake 
they had for themselves.

Apparently the two men were celebrating what they felt was now a 
guaranteed union of their two families and the future of the 
Anything Goes school through the engagement of Ryoga and Nabiki. 
But why they felt this way was lost on Perfume. She was just happy 
that they were leaving Kasumi alone.

If there was one thing that made Perfume angrier than anything 
else, it was the treatment of her Airen that she had observed over 
the past few days. It was like Kasumi was her family&#39;s personal 
maid and nothing more.

This treatment didn&#39;t please Perfume at all. In fact, it made her 
seethe inwardly all because of two things.

The first was her status. She was Perfume, the Enforcer of 
Joketsuzoku. Feared by all who knew her back home in China for 
not only her skill in combat but her bad temper and tendency to 
say things more vulgar than any hardened criminal would.

The second was Kasumi&#39;s status. Kasumi was her Airen. The Airen 
of the Enforcer of Joketsuzoku. That meant that back in the 
tribe Kasumi was a very powerful figure.

And to Perfume, this meant that Kasumi shouldn&#39;t be cleaning up 
after two drunken louts and cooking meals for a family that didn&#39;t 
even thank her for all her efforts.

No, Kasumi should be doing something else.

But what?

She knew nothing of Kasumi&#39;s pursuits since she didn&#39;t seem to 
have one other than pleasing her family. That meant that she&#39;d 
have to help Kasumi find one. Surely there was something that her 
Airen enjoyed. Something that she&#39;d want to make a life out of 
doing.

Whatever it was, Perfume was going to find it.

Right after she finished watching Genma and Soun sing the seventh 
chorus of a Hundred Bottles of Sake on the Wall in off key tones.

Because for drunken louts they were amusing.

------------------------------------------------

&quot;No worries, Tachi,&quot; said Shampoo cheerfully. &quot;Am sure that demo-
sister is fine. She seem like... capable girl.&quot;

Shampoo was sitting on the porch outside of the sitting room 
with Tatewaki as they both tried to ignore the sounds of Genma 
and Soun&#39;s drinking binge.

&quot;She&#39;s with that foul Saotome,&quot; grumbled Tatewaki. &quot;I&#39;m sure of 
it. I must rid Kodachi of his influence somehow.&quot;

&quot;Why not just have de--sister dumping him?&quot; asked Shampoo 
curiously. &quot;Is too too simple solution.&quot;

&quot;Because,&quot; Tatewaki heaved a sigh. &quot;Kodachi is involved with him 
and if my memories stand correct, it isn&#39;t wise to interfere when 
she has her mind made up. She was quite adamant in that way as a 
child.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; said Shampoo quietly. After a moment, she brightened in a 
smile and tugging on Tatewaki&#39;s shirt sleeve she said, &quot;Shampoo 
have idea to make Tachi happy!&quot;

Looking up at the lavender haired Amazon, Tatewaki couldn&#39;t help 
but smile as he asked, &quot;Do you now?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Shampoo do,&quot; said Shampoo as she beamed. &quot;Why not Tachi 
spar some with Shampoo? It be fun!&quot;

&quot;Fighting would be fun?&quot; Tatewaki asked skeptically.

Scowling a bit, Shampoo put her hands on her hips and said, &quot;It 
help Tachi get mind off sister. That is fun!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; said Tatewaki slowly. &quot;I have never sparred 
with a female other than my Mistress and--&quot;

&quot;You is thinking Shampoo too weak to battle?&quot; asked Shampoo in 
sharp and arching tones.

&quot;Of course not!&quot; Tatewaki exclaimed quickly as he waved his 
hands in a warding motion. &quot;I was merely saying I have not 
battled many females. But,&quot; he paused to give a soft smile. &quot;It 
would be an honor to battle you, Shampoo.&quot;

&quot;Much thanks, Tachi,&quot; said Shampoo who had turned a light hue of 
red at his compliment. Shaking her head, she smiled and bounded 
to her feet. &quot;Come on! We go and battle in dojo!&quot; Shampoo said 
as she pulled Tatewaki to his feet.

&quot;Yes, Shampoo,&quot; said Tatewaki. He trailed after his companion 
wearing a small smile as he went. Only seconds had passed but 
Tatewaki was already forgetting his worries about Kodachi&#39;s 
relationship with Ranma.

And it was all thanks to Shampoo.

----------------------------------------------

&quot;I don&#39;t get it, Dachi,&quot; said Ranma. She rubbed the back of her 
static filled blonde head, the hairs of which were standing on 
end. &quot;Did this amulet put a curse me or what?&quot;

The two were walking back to the Tendo dojo, Ranma having woken 
up a few minutes after Kodachi left the building where they had 
their meeting with Cologne.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure dearest,&quot; Kodachi replied. She formed a thoughtful 
expression then murmured, &quot;But it&#39;s clear that piece of jewelry 
has some magical properties.&quot;

&quot;Magic?&quot; Ranma echoed. With a frown, she touched the amulet and 
said, &quot;I wonder if Mom could--&quot;

Before Ranma couldn&#39;t finish her statement she got struck by 
lightning for the fifty-first time.

&quot;Darling,&quot; said Kodachi with a sigh. &quot;I don&#39;t think that you 
should touch the amulet if that keeps happening to you.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ranma said after a moment. She coughed out a small black 
cloud then said, &quot;You&#39;re probably right, Dachi.&quot;

Kodachi merely wore a look of satisfaction as they entered the 
Tendo house and took off their shoes. She paused to listen to the 
sound of terrible singing then said, &quot;It appears as if the others 
are having some kind of party.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s probably Pop,&quot; said Ranma as she snorted. &quot;It&#39;d be just like 
him to get drunk during my time of need.&quot;

Not replying, Kodachi merely walked towards the sitting room while 
Ranma got struck by lightning for the fifty-second time.

------------------------------------------------

Pushing through the crowd of people, Ryoga and Nabiki made their 
way out of the Karaoke Palace with wide smiles on their faces as 
they did so. Finally escaping the surge of the crowd, the pair 
dashed down the street as they tried to lose some of their more 
exuberant fans from the bar.

Laughing as they ran, Ryoga and Nabiki slowed in their pace when 
they lost all of their straggling fans. His eyes twinkling, Ryoga 
regained his breath and gave Nabiki a fanged smile as he said, 
&quot;That was fun, huh?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Nabiki agreed breathlessly. &quot;I never thought that singing 
in front of people would be such a rush.&quot;

&quot;And the cheers!&quot; Ryoga shook his head. &quot;It was amazing. I never 
heard anything like it, not even when I did some competing in 
martial arts tournaments.&quot;

&quot;It was crazy, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; said Nabiki with a smile.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Ryoga as he met Nabiki&#39;s eyes. &quot;It was.&quot;

The two remained silent for a moment as they gazed into each 
others eyes. After awhile, Ryoga turned a dark red hue and he 
said quietly, &quot;Nabiki?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Ryoga?&quot; asked Nabiki in a whisper as their lips were 
only millimeters apart.

Directing his eyes up towards the sky before closing them, 
Ryoga coughed then stammered, &quot;Your shirt...&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Nabiki blinked.

Nabiki looked down at her uniform for Furinkan High and found 
that somehow the collar to it had been ripped and it now revealed 
a good portion of her cleavage. Releasing a high pitched squeak, 
Nabiki hastily covered her chest.

She was still covering herself and cursing her stupidity when she 
heard Ryoga say, &quot;Here, Nabiki.&quot;

Looking at her iinazuke, Nabiki saw he still had his eyes closed 
and his face was bright red but in his hand Ryoga held several of 
the bandannas he wore out to her.

&quot;Try using them to fix your shirt,&quot; Ryoga explained.

Taking the bandannas, Nabiki quickly tied one around her throat 
and then arranged the others to cover her exposed cleavage. But 
when she finished, Nabiki paused to study the form of Ryoga who 
still had his eyes closed.

&quot;Okay,&quot; said Nabiki after a moment. &quot;All clear.&quot;

Opening his eyes, Ryoga looked at Nabiki and flushed at the smile 
that she wore. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he offered quietly.

&quot;For what?&quot; asked Nabiki in puzzlement.

&quot;For what happened to your shirt,&quot; Ryoga said. He then formed a 
scowl as he said, &quot;I should go back there and get those guys for 
doing that. Lousy perverts...&quot;

&quot;Tell you what,&quot; Nabiki said as her smile widened. &quot;Why don&#39;t we 
do that together? Tomorrow maybe?&quot;

Looking at Nabiki in surprise, Ryoga could only blink before he 
squeaked, &quot;Together?&quot;

&quot;Yes, together,&quot; said Nabiki in teasing tones. She gave Ryoga a 
light punch on the arm before she pushed him gently on the back 
to make him walk forward. &quot;Like what we&#39;re doing now. I kind of 
had fun today, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I did,&quot; Ryoga admitted softly. &quot;A lot.&quot;

&quot;So why let our parents dumb idea about an engagement keep from 
us being friends and having fun?&quot; Nabiki reasoned. &quot;That&#39;s pretty 
stupid, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

Looking at Nabiki carefully, Ryoga said, &quot;Yeah. It&#39;s really 
stupid.&quot;

&quot;We have a deal then?&quot; asked Nabiki. &quot;We&#39;re both going back 
there tomorrow to get those guys for what they did to my shirt 
during that little after show riot.&quot;

&quot;Definitely,&quot; replied Ryoga as he grinned. He paused to offer 
his hand to Nabiki and said, &quot;Shake on it?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; said Nabiki with a beaming expression before she 
took Ryoga&#39;s hand and gave it a firm shake.

The two then headed towards the Tendo dojo in relative silence 
before Ryoga said, &quot;Nabiki?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Ryoga?&quot; asked Nabiki.

&quot;And can we also maybe sing again?&quot; Ryoga asked as he wore a 
innocent almost puppy dog like expression.

Looking at her iinazuke, Nabiki shook her head and couldn&#39;t 
help but smile as she said, &quot;You bet we can.&quot;

-------------------------------------------------

Chocolate woke up to the sounds of low murmuring and the sight 
of several doctors hovering over her.

&quot;What the heck...?&quot; murmured Chocolate blearily as she started 
to sit up only to be stopped by one of the doctors.

&quot;Stay still, Miss!&quot; the doctor exclaimed. &quot;We haven&#39;t discerned 
what your injuries are so you must be careful.&quot;

&quot;Injuries?&quot; Chocolate repeated. She rubbed her green eyes and 
sighed. &quot;But I feel fine. I don&#39;t have any injuries.&quot;

There was a pause and Chocolate looked at the doctors only to 
find that they were all ogling her. At this she released another 
sigh before she flopped back onto her bed.

Covering her eyes with her arm, Chocolate muttered sourly, &quot;This 
sort of stuff is starting to really annoy me. Now I know why 
Shampoo used to get so mad at me.&quot;

&quot;What are all of you doing here?!&quot;

Uncovering her eyes at the sound of an outraged feminine voice, 
Chocolate observed as a beautiful lady doctor accompanied by an 
even more beautiful girl wearing a soccer uniform approached her 
bed with faces of exasperation.

Instantly all the male doctors dispersed, yelping and muttering 
under their breaths as they scurried away. That was when the lady 
doctor stopped by Chocolate&#39;s bed and smiled.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry about that,&quot; the lady doctor said. &quot;Male doctors are 
still males and they sometimes get...&quot;

&quot;Excited,&quot; the girl in the soccer uniform offered.

Giving the soccer girl a droll look, the lady doctor said, 
&quot;Certainly that&#39;s one way of putting it, Akane.&quot;

&quot;Of course!&quot; the soccer girl, whose name was Akane, said in 
cheerful yet somehow mischievous tones. She directed a worried 
gaze at Chocolate and asked, &quot;How do you feel?&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; squeaked Chocolate. She laughed nervously and cleared 
her throat before she said, &quot;I feel fine.&quot;

&quot;Akane,&quot; said the lady doctor as she looked slightly perturbed. 
&quot;I should be the one asking my patient questions.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, Umi,&quot; said Akane sheepishly.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; the lady doctor named Umi said with a smile. 
&quot;Just don&#39;t go and steal my job, huh?&quot; Akane giggled at this 
while Umi turned her attention back to Chocolate. &quot;I&#39;m Dr. Fuyuki 
Umi, your attending physician.&quot; She paused and gave Chocolate a 
close look as she asked, &quot;Can you recall your name? Do you know 
who you are?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; said Chocolate as she blinked. &quot;I&#39;m Mo--&quot; She paused 
to laugh nervously then said, &quot;Chocolate.&quot;

&quot;Your name is Chocolate?&quot; asked Umi in skeptical tones as she 
looked at the girl closely.

&quot;Yes, Chocolate,&quot; affirmed Chocolate with a fierce nod. &quot;I&#39;m from 
China. We have different names there.&quot;

&quot;No surname?&quot; asked Umi.

&quot;No,&quot; said Chocolate sheepishly. &quot;Like I said before, we have 
different names back home in China.&quot;

&quot;Obviously,&quot; murmured Umi as she shook her head and wrote the 
information down on her clipboard. &quot;Well then, Miss Chocolate. 
You came in relatively unscathed with only bruises but Akane 
claims you came falling out of the sky and into her arms. Is 
this true?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t claim!&quot; Akane protested huffily. &quot;She did come falling 
out of the sky! I saw it myself!&quot;

&quot;Right, Akane,&quot; said Umi dryly as she adjusted her small wire 
rim glasses. &quot;Just like you saw that flying man.&quot;

&quot;He was flying!&quot; insisted Akane. &quot;He had a big red cape and this 
big &#39;S&#39; on chest. It was a neat outfit.&quot;

&quot;I told you to stop taking those iron supplement pills that your 
Coach recommends,&quot; Umi said. &quot;They tend to make you hallucinate 
from what I&#39;ve gathered.&quot;

Turning red, Akane said, &quot;I wasn&#39;t--&quot;

&quot;Excuse me?&quot;

Simultaneously, Akane and Umi turned to look at Chocolate who 
wore a wary expression. She offered them a small smile and 
said, &quot;The last thing I remember is getting hit by a bus. So 
I guess it&#39;s possible I went flying into the air.&quot;

&quot;You got hit by a bus?&quot; asked Umi incredulously.

&quot;Ouch,&quot; Akane winced. &quot;That must have hurt.&quot;

Laughing a bit, Chocolate rubbed the back of her silky black 
head and said, &quot;Yeah. It sort of did.&quot;

&quot;How did you get hit by a bus?&quot; asked Akane.

&quot;Some guys were chasing me and I was trying to escape from them. 
I didn&#39;t see it coming,&quot; said Chocolate before she formed a scowl 
which made her even more cute. &quot;They just wouldn&#39;t leave me 
alone. When I find them...&quot;

&quot;No way did she get hit by a bus,&quot; muttered Umi.

&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; said Akane as she gained a look of sudden 
recognition. &quot;You said that your name was Chocolate?&quot;

&quot;Yes, my name is Chocolate,&quot; said Chocolate as she darted her 
eyes nervously around the hospital.

&quot;I saw those guys that were chasing you,&quot; said Akane. &quot;I know 
them, they go to my high school.&quot;

&quot;A bus! How did you survive getting hit by a bus?!&quot; Umi 
interrupted as she waved her hands around.

Chocolate and Akane slowly turned their attention to Umi and 
finally Chocolate said, &quot;I bounced a little.&quot;

&quot;You bounced a little?&quot; repeated Umi in dazed tones.

&quot;I know some tricks from back home,&quot; Chocolate offered. &quot;The 
impact didn&#39;t really do all that much to me. It&#39;s obvious I&#39;m 
in perfect health. Can I leave now?&quot;

Instead of replying, Umi shook her head again and wandered away 
muttering something about buses and girls who bounce off of them 
under her breath.

&quot;She&#39;s a really good doctor,&quot; said Akane brightly as she gave 
Chocolate a wide smile. &quot;But a little weird at times.&quot;

&quot;If you say so,&quot; replied Chocolate wryly. She then paused as she 
recalled something. &quot;You said that you know those guys who were 
chasing me?&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Akane said easily. &quot;They go to my high school. Usually 
they&#39;re chasing after me though. But I can see why they&#39;d chase 
after you, Chocolate. You&#39;re very pretty.&quot;

Turning bright red, Chocolate said, &quot;No, I&#39;m not!&quot;

&quot;Sure you are,&quot; said Akane as she tilted her head to one side
 and observed Chocolate closely. &quot;You must know how pretty you 
are. In fact, you&#39;re probably the prettiest girl that I&#39;ve ever 
seen. And you seem really nice too.&quot;

Not replying, Chocolate ducked her head and flushed slightly. 
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said softly. &quot;But I&#39;m not pretty.&quot; She lifted her 
gaze and found herself saying, &quot;I think you&#39;re much prettier than 
me.&quot;

It was Akane&#39;s turn to blush and she was about to say something 
in response when Umi shouted, &quot;It&#39;s impossible! I just can&#39;t 
believe that she got hit by a bus, Doctor Yufu!&quot;

Akane looked towards Umi and saw her getting into yet another 
fight with one of her superiors. With a smile, she turned back 
to Chocolate and said, &quot;Silly, Umi. She alw--&quot;

Stopping in her speech, Akane blinked at the sight of an empty 
bed and a void in where the other girl had been. Her eyes going 
wide, Akane said softly, &quot;Chocolate?&quot;

Locking her gaze on the open window several beds down, Akane ran 
forward to look out of it just in time to see a blurred figure 
bounding away on the street below.

Watching Chocolate depart, Akane gave an almost wistful sigh as 
she murmured, &quot;Fast and pretty.&quot;

------------------------------------------------

When Ranma recovered from getting struck by lightning for the 
fifty-second time, she wandered into the sitting room to see 
Genma and Soun drinking sake.

&quot;Just think!&quot; Genma exclaimed. &quot;Soon our schools will be joined 
and your daughter will be Hibiki Nabiki!&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot; Soun said with a vigorous nod. &quot;And it&#39;s such a very good 
name, isn&#39;t it? I&#39;m so happy for her!&quot;

&quot;You gotta be kidding,&quot; muttered Ranma as she stepped into the 
room. &quot;That name sounds so du--&quot;

The rest of Ranma&#39;s statement was cut off as she got struck by 
lightning for the fifty-third time.

&quot;Goodness,&quot; said Kodachi. She pressed her hand to her chest in 
mild surprise, it being mild because she&#39;d already seen this 
happen fifty-three times before. &quot;We really must do something 
about that dreadful amulet, darling.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re telling me?&quot; Ranma said before she lifted her static 
filled blonde head to look at her girlfriend.

&quot;Is that you, boy?&quot; asked Genma as he squinted. &quot;Is it just me 
or did you just get struck by lightning?&quot;

&quot;Lightning? Oh my,&quot; Kasumi entered the room and wiped her hands 
on her apron. &quot;Perfume thought she felt a large electrical 
discharge but I told her it was just nerves.&quot;

Hearing her name, the Amazon Enforcer trailed into the room after 
Kasumi only to freeze on seeing Ranma. Her sapphire eyes going 
wide, Perfume said shakily, &quot;Legendary slave amulet what take 
souls freedom of the wearer!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; asked Ranma.

&quot;Sounds fancy,&quot; Genma commented. &quot;Figures that you&#39;d wear 
something with a name like that, boy.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a warning I should think,&quot; said Soun wisely.

&quot;Would you two shut up?!&quot; said Ranma before she leapt to her feet 
and crossed to Perfume. &quot;You know what this thing is?&quot; Ranma asked 
quickly. &quot;Tell me what it does!&quot;

Sniffing at this, Perfume folded her arms across her chest and 
said, &quot;And why should I be doing that? You is one of demon 
thieves what rob tribe. I no want be helping you.&quot;

&quot;Tell me!&quot; Ranma demanded. &quot;I&#39;ll pay you! I&#39;ll--&quot;

Before Ranma could say anything more she got struck by lightning 
for the fifty-fourth time.

&quot;Is slave amulet for sure,&quot; said Perfume in superior tones with 
a hint of humor as she looked at Ranma&#39;s charred and crumpled 
form. &quot;Only that amulet have such powers.&quot;

While Ranma groaned, Kodachi crossed to the blonde elf and knelt 
at her side. Stroking Ranma&#39;s hair, she looked up at Perfume and 
said, &quot;I know that you don&#39;t favor us. I know that you even hate 
us. But please, tell us what sort of purpose this amulet serves 
when placed around a person&#39;s neck.&quot;

Perfume considered this for a moment when a calm soothing voice 
said, &quot;The slave amulet, as its known, is used as a magical 
control device. Amongst all the various punishments of the tribe 
it is one of the most feared because when the amulet is worn the 
wearer loses all control of their fate and thoughts because of 
its random actions. The amulet is controlled by the person who 
programs it with the essence of their life force or chi and only 
they can remove the amulet from the neck of the wearer. The only 
other way that it may be removed is through the death of the 
wearer.&quot;

&quot;Damn, Kasumi,&quot; said Ranma who was recovered and looking at the 
eldest Tendo sister in awe. &quot;Where did you find out all of that 
stuff about this funky amulet?&quot;

&quot;From reading Perfume&#39;s books,&quot; said Kasumi with a charming 
smile. &quot;They&#39;re really quite interesting.&quot;

&quot;They must be since Kasumi read all in one day,&quot; Perfume said as 
she shook her head. Looking back to Ranma, she said, &quot;What Airen 
say is true. You no can take off amulet and it is controlled by 
Great Grandmother. Most likely this is punishment for dishonor 
you did to tribe with stealing.&quot;

&quot;So she seeks to control Ranma dearest through this magical 
amulet,&quot; Kodachi mused.

&quot;Yeah, right!&quot; Ranma snorted. She leapt to her feet and clenched 
her hand into a fist as she proclaimed, &quot;That&#39;ll never work! 
Saotome Ranma won&#39;t be controlled!&quot;

Then Ranma got struck by lightning for the fifty-fifth time.

The entire group watched Ranma topple over on the floor again, 
before Perfume said dryly, &quot;That so?&quot;

&quot;Now that has to hurt,&quot; Soun remarked.

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Genma nodded as he drank his sake.

Observing Ranma&#39;s twitching form, Kodachi sighed and looked to 
Perfume. &quot;Isn&#39;t there some way that we might convince your Great 
Grandmother to remove it?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Not sure,&quot; Perfume pondered. &quot;Would usually say no but Airen is 
here. I guess now would have to say that you ask her yourself. 
Great Grandmother not keep motivations secret most times. She 
tell why she does what she does.&quot;

&quot;Ugh, what is this foul creature?&quot;

Everyone looked to see Tatewaki standing on the open porch to the 
sitting room with Shampoo at his side. The tall Kendoist was 
staring at Ranma&#39;s very charred form and making a face as he did 
so.

&quot;Thanks a lot, Kuno,&quot; rasped Ranma before she rolled over to lie 
on her stomach. &quot;I appreciate the compliment.&quot;

&quot;Saotome?&quot; asked Tatewaki. He knelt down in front of Ranma and 
inspected her female form with his eyes. After a moment he 
chuckled and said, &quot;An appropriate curse. You don&#39;t act as a 
man truly should so now you&#39;re a woman.&quot;

Ranma scowled at this and was about to make a retort when Shampoo 
produced a bonbori out of nowhere and gave Tatewaki a hit on the 
top of his head with it.

&quot;Shampoo,&quot; said Tatewaki as he looked up at the lavender haired 
Amazon. &quot;That hurt, you know.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, Tachi,&quot; said Shampoo sweetly. &quot;But you just insulting 
womans and Shampoo not stand for that.&quot;

&quot;Ah, yes,&quot; Tatewaki said wisely. &quot;I apologize for my mistake in 
comparing this wretch, Saotome, to all women. It was a horrendous 
error on my part my dear Shampoo.&quot;

&quot;That what--&quot; Shampoo paused in her speech as her eyes went wide 
and backing away nervously, she pointed at Ranma and said, 
&quot;Legendary slave amulet what is evil!&quot;

&quot;Great,&quot; said Ranma sourly. &quot;Everybody has horror stories about 
this stupid piece of junk. Just great.&quot;

There was a discernible pause and everyone waited for Ranma to 
get struck by lightning for the fifty-sixth time.

Nothing happened.

&quot;Ha!&quot; Ranma exclaimed triumphantly. She leapt to her feet and 
said, &quot;Stupid amulet! You can&#39;t beat me! I&#39;m--&quot;

Ranma never finished her sentence as she got struck by lightning 
for the fifty-sixth time.

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Tatewaki commented as he watched Ranma fall back 
and onto the floor.

&quot;Where he get slave amulet?&quot; asked Shampoo. She turned her 
attention to Perfume and said, &quot;Cousin?&quot;

&quot;Great Grandmother give to him,&quot; Perfume supplied. &quot;Am thinking 
is punishment for stealing from tribe.&quot;

&quot;Aiyaah,&quot; said Shampoo as her eyes went wide. &quot;Is very bad scary 
punishment. Almost feeling sorry for demon thief for having such 
a thing be happening to him.&quot; She then paused and looked at 
Kodachi. &quot;Why she not punished?&quot;

&quot;Not know,&quot; Perfume shrugged. &quot;Maybe is because is sister to your 
tall boy, Tachi?&quot;

Flushing at this, Shampoo darted over to Perfume and hissed, &quot;Is 
not my Tachi! Why you saying that?&quot;

&quot;You be telling me, Cousin?&quot; asked Perfume in very mischievous 
tones. &quot;Following him around like lost puppy.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me.&quot;

Both Amazons froze on seeing Tatewaki hovering over Shampoo&#39;s 
shoulder with a solemn expression on his handsome features.

&quot;You said that my sister might be punished as well?&quot; Tatewaki 
asked. &quot;But the agreement that I made with your Great Grandmother 
was based on the premise that Kodachi would not be harmed. Would 
she truly break it in such a manner?&quot;

Shampoo and Perfume exchanged a serious look before Perfume 
replied, &quot;Am not sure.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t count me out yet,&quot; Ranma said with a groan as she tried 
to push herself up and out of Kodachi&#39;s arms where she had been 
resting. &quot;I&#39;ll get that old ghoul for this.&quot;

&quot;Of course you will, Saotome,&quot; said Tatewaki in smug and humorous 
tones. &quot;You&#39;re in perfect condition to battle with the Matriarch. 
It&#39;s too bad that you just happen to look and smell like a 
charcoal briquette.&quot;

Pushing herself to her feet, Ranma wobbled slightly before she 
gave a wide smile that showed off the white of her teeth that 
looked odd against her blackened features.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; said Ranma confidently. &quot;I&#39;ll figure out what 
that old ghoul is up to and then I&#39;ll make it so she has to take 
this junky piece of jewelry off me.&quot; She paused to give a thumbs 
up signal before she declared, &quot;I won&#39;t fail! I&#39;m Saotome Ranma 
and I always win!&quot;

At this statement, everyone in the group exchanged a wary look 
while Ranma burst into impudent laughter.

Mere moments later, Ranma got struck by lightning for the fifty-
seventh time.

Amazingly enough, it still hurt.

------------------------------------------------

It was a quiet morning and everyone was eating a quiet breakfast 
in the sitting room around their quiet table.

Or at least it was quiet until a scream pierced the air.

A very high pitched and feminine scream.

Genma and Soun remained where they were and continued eating but 
most everyone else in the house went running towards the sound 
of the screaming.

This meant that when Ranma walked out of the furo there was a 
large group of people to meet her.

&quot;Ranma dearest?&quot; Kodachi was the first to speak. &quot;Is something 
the matter? Why did you scream like that?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Saotome,&quot; said Tatewaki with a frown. &quot;Why did you yell 
with such volume? Is this one of your jokes?&quot;

&quot;Ranma?&quot; asked Ryoga as he studied the shocked figure of his 
brother. &quot;You feeling okay?&quot;

Ranma looked from Kodachi to Tatewaki to Ryoga then back to 
Kodachi again before she ran towards the dark gymnast and hugging 
her, she wailed, &quot;I can&#39;t change back!&quot;

Hearing this, everyone exchanged a worried look which magnified 
when Ranma pulled away from Kodachi and got struck by lightning 
for the seventy-second time.

This being the seventy-second time because of the amount of 
times that Ranma was struck by lightning during the previous 
night.

Needless to say, Ranma wasn&#39;t feeling too well.

------------------------------------------------

&quot;That&#39;s a mean thing to do,&quot; Akane said as she finished eating. 
&quot;What a bad piece of jewelry. It&#39;s nothing at all like the 
jewelry I get on my birthday, holidays, and odd numbered days 
from all of my fans.&quot;

The group were discussing Ranma and the amulet that apparently 
froze him in his current female elfin form. Ranma being out of 
the room as she was still upstairs with Kodachi.

&quot;Yes, Akane,&quot; said Nabiki with a sigh. &quot;Nothing like your jewelry 
at all. Then again, most of your fans don&#39;t have a tendency to 
give you accursed jewelry.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Akane beamed. &quot;Aren&#39;t I lucky?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t get it,&quot; murmured Ryoga. &quot;Why would Cologne want to 
stick Ranma in his female form? I mean, it&#39;s not like she can 
get anything out of doing that to him. It just doesn&#39;t make any 
sense.&quot; Looking at his iinazuke, Ryoga asked, &quot;Do you understand 
why she did it, Nabiki?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; said Nabiki as she shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m just as lost as 
you, Ryoga-kun. About this problem, anyway.&quot;

Smiling at the slight joke, Ryoga scratched the back of his 
head and said, &quot;But there must be a reason for it.&quot;

&quot;We should ask Shampoo,&quot; suggested Tatewaki. &quot;It&#39;s almost certain 
that she would have some ideas to help us.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;ll ask Perfume,&quot; said Kasumi as she entered the room and 
sat around the table with them. &quot;I&#39;m sure that she&#39;ll be more 
than happy to help me discover the answer.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; said Nabiki with a nod. &quot;It&#39;s a plan then.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s a plan?&quot;

The entire group looked up at the sound of Ranma&#39;s voice only to 
freeze on seeing her standing in the doorway to the sitting room. 
But Ranma really wasn&#39;t the reason that they froze. It was more 
what Ranma was wearing.

Because Ranma was currently decked out in a pair of notably 
tight and form fitting black leather pants, a shrunken white tank 
top which served to reveal both her flat stomach and ample 
cleavage, and a pair of shiny silver boots.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Ranma greeted casually before she plopped down to sit 
next to Akane. &quot;What&#39;re you all talking about?&quot;

There was a long pause of silence before Genma looked up from his 
shogi game with Soun and noticed just what Ranma was wearing. The 
reaction was immediate.

Genma&#39;s face turned bright red and after he finished 
hyperventilating, he shouted, &quot;WHAT DO YOU HAVE ON, BOY?!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Ranma said blankly as looked at Genma. &quot;I figured as 
long as I&#39;m stuck as a girl I might as well dress like one.&quot; 
She paused to smile lasciviously. &quot;A real sexy girl.&quot;

&quot;YOUR MOTHER WILL--&quot; Genma paused as his mind slowly registered 
Ranma&#39;s words. Narrowing his eyes, Genma moved forward to grasp 
Ranma by the collar of her tight tank top. &quot;What do you mean by 
saying you&#39;re stuck as a girl, boy?&quot;

&quot;I mean that I&#39;m stuck as a girl,&quot; said Ranma simply. &quot;This funky 
amulet that the old ghoul gave me won&#39;t let me change back into 
a guy. Even splashing me with hot water doesn&#39;t do the trick 
thanks to its weirdo magic.&quot;

Genma froze on hearing this before he burst into a flood of 
tears and wailed, &quot;Nodoka&#39;s going to kill me!!&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Ranma cheerfully. &quot;Mother won&#39;t be too happy about 
this, will she? Me changing into a girl was gonna be hard enough 
to explain but me stuck as one?&quot; Ranma paused to whistle. &quot;You&#39;re 
in deep doo, old man.&quot;

&quot;Ranma,&quot; said Genma in a low hiss. &quot;You--&quot;

Before Genma could finish his reply, Ranma got struck by lightning 
for the seventy-third time.

Looking at Ranma&#39;s smoking form that was toppled over on the 
floor, Genma said, &quot;Suddenly hitting him seems like an entirely 
pointless act.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Soun agreed with a nod. &quot;That must have caused more pain 
than your fist ever could.&quot;

&quot;Old ghoul,&quot; Ranma muttered from the floor as she slowly pushed 
herself up. &quot;I&#39;m gonna get you for this!&quot;

Seconds after saying this, Ranma got struck by lightning for the 
seventy-fourth time.

------------------------------------------------

&quot;Shampoo!&quot; shouted Perfume irately. &quot;Why you still in bathroom 
after whole hour?! Some of us have to piss!&quot;

&quot;Perfume,&quot; said Shampoo as she finally opened the door to the 
hotel bathroom. &quot;Why you be so--&quot;

Shampoo was cut off as Perfume took the opportunity to barrel 
inside of the bathroom, shove Shampoo outside, and slam the door 
shut.

Listening to the sound of a waterfall, Shampoo wore a scowl as 
she said, &quot;That very rude, Cousin.&quot;

&quot;Bite me,&quot; Perfume&#39;s voice floated out from behind the bathroom 
door before the sound of a toilet flushing was heard. &quot;Why you 
taking so long in bathroom anyway? You only is going to Japanese 
style school. What is big deal?&quot;

&quot;Is no big deal,&quot; Shampoo sniffed as she folded her arms over her 
altered Furinkan High girls uniform. &quot;What is crime in wanting to 
look good? That all is about.&quot;

&quot;Somehow am not believing you,&quot; said Perfume over the sound of 
running water. &quot;Have more to do with wanting to look good for 
your new private sex toy, Tachi, right?&quot;

&quot;What you saying?&quot; Shampoo asked in arched tones.

&quot;Am saying that you look like in heat when you is near him,&quot; 
Perfume said as she opened the bathroom door to lean against 
its frame. &quot;You must be knowing this.&quot;

&quot;Perfume,&quot; began Shampoo rather menacingly.

&quot;Calm down,&quot; Perfume dismissed before she walked past Shampoo 
and out into their hotel room. &quot;You can&#39;t lie to me, Cousin. I 
knowing truth soon as I see you with him. You is liking boy 
named Tachi.&quot; Sitting on the edge of the bed, Perfume smirked 
and asked, &quot;How far you get with him?&quot;

Gazing at Perfume for a long moment, Shampoo finally sighed and 
said, &quot;Not far. Tachi not respond to usual tricks. Shampoo try 
flirting but he either not notice or he get red in face and not 
look at Shampoo anymore. Is annoying.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; said Perfume thoughtfully. &quot;Maybe you is needing to try 
other way of getting Tachi&#39;s attention?&quot;

&quot;Easy enough to say,&quot; Shampoo said in slightly mocking tones. 
&quot;But have any suggestions?&quot;

For a response, Perfume smiled.

------------------------------------------------

&quot;Finally,&quot; Chocolate said in between breaths as she pressed 
herself up against the hotel ledge. &quot;I&#39;ve finally found the 
hotel that Shampoo is staying in.&quot;

After a lengthy search since her arrival in Japan, Chocolate 
was now standing outside on the ledge to the hotel room for 
her former beloved, Shampoo.

The search had been long and hard and Chocolate could hardly 
believe how many of the hotels had Shampoos, Perfumes, and 
Colognes in them. It was truly baffling.

Anyway, she was standing on the ledge, quite unaware of the 
large crowd of people that were gathering on the street below 
because of her location. Rifling through one of the many 
subspace pockets she produced, Chocolate pulled out a device 
that one of her many male admirers had given her.

Pressing the strange stethoscope like instrument up against the 
hotel wall, Chocolate closed her eyes and listened to the sound 
of her once cherished Shampoo&#39;s voice.

&quot;That no good, Cousin,&quot; Shampoo was saying. &quot;There must be some 
way to get Tachi&#39;s attention. Maybe if I making him jealous he 
fight for Shampoo&#39;s affection and then date?&quot;

Pulling away from the hotel wall, Chocolate formed a thoughtful 
expression and murmured, &quot;So that&#39;s it.&quot;

After a long moment of pause, Chocolate swung around to face 
forward and proclaimed, &quot;If Tachi is what you want, then Tachi 
is what you&#39;ll get! I swear that I&#39;ll help you win his affections, 
Shampoo! It&#39;s my new mission!&quot;

Seconds later, Chocolate looked down to see that she was no 
longer standing on the hotel ledge.

Being as she had several hundred tons of weapons on her and in 
subspace, Chocolate fell towards the ground rather quickly.

Gravity, as the Tick once said, is a harsh mistress.

----------------------------------------------

&quot;Nabiki?&quot; said Ryoga nervously.

&quot;Yes, Ryoga?&quot; asked Nabiki, looking his way.

The two were walking in the front entrance to Furinkan High along 
with the rest of their group. Well, not including Ranma because 
she was currently being tugged along in the little red wagon 
that she was passed out in thanks to the number of times that 
she got struck by lightning during their usual walk to school.

Lucky for Ranma, the little girl that Kodachi had bought the red 
wagon from didn&#39;t know the value of yen yet and she&#39;d gotten a 
really cheap deal on it.

But what had Ryoga nervous wasn&#39;t that or the fact that Akane 
had joined that weird crowd of boys which always gathered in 
the far corner of the yard.

No, what had Ryoga nervous was the fact that he and Nabiki had 
a good sized group of people gazing at them with adoring and 
almost sparkly looking eyes.

Eyes that Ryoga had never seen focused on him before. Eyes that 
were always focused on his brother, Ranma. Eyes that were now 
focused on him and not Ranma.

To put it simply, this change of events was seriously freaking 
Ryoga out. In fact, Ryoga was in what some might call the Twilight 
Zone level of freaking out.

It was a level that very few humans reach.

Nabiki, being a person who handled strange situations thanks to 
her relationship with Akane and now through her partnership to 
Ranma and Kodachi, looked their admirers right in the eye and 
responded the only way that she knew how. She used a mild and 
somewhat subtle threat on them.

&quot;Is there a problem?&quot; asked Nabiki with a hint of steel.

Immediately the group paled a bit, then conferred for several 
moments before the girl in front exclaimed, &quot;We just wanted to 
tell you that you&#39;re a great performer, Sempai!&quot;

&quot;Yeah!&quot; a guy in the group shouted. &quot;You rock!&quot;

&quot;Kick ass, Tendo-san!&quot;

&quot;You too, Hibiki-san!&quot;

&quot;You both are the coolest ever!&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re the sexiest couple!&quot;

&quot;Ubersexy!&quot;

Blinking at the series of outbursts, Ryoga and Nabiki looked at 
each other and said blankly, &quot;Ubersexy?&quot;

------------------------------------------------

&quot;Saotome,&quot; said Tatewaki in grave tones. &quot;I do not think this is 
wise. You might injure yourself further.&quot;

&quot;No way,&quot; Ranma said stubbornly as she attempted to push herself 
up and out of the little red wagon. &quot;I&#39;m Saotome Ranma. There 
ain&#39;t no way I&#39;m going inside like this.&quot;

At this, Kodachi looked at Ranma in certain frustration before 
she formed a coy expression. Trailing her fingers lightly down 
Ranma&#39;s chest, Kodachi paused at the nexus of the other girl&#39;s 
cleavage as she purred, &quot;Please, my darling. Do it for me won&#39;t 
you? It would make me ever so happy to be able to care for you 
on hand and foot.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; said Ranma in almost squeaky tones before she cleared 
her throat. &quot;If you insist, Dachi.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid I do,&quot; Kodachi said sensuously as she moved forward 
to meet Ranma&#39;s lips with her own.

While this went on, Tatewaki averted his eyes, tried not to 
blush, and silently cursed Ranma for his fiendish hold over his 
normally angelic little sister.

He had no worries though, because soon enough he would free 
Kodachi from Ranma&#39;s treacherous grasp.

Or at the very least, teach Ranma some morals.

As Tatewaki was contemplating this, Ranma got struck by 
lightning for the eightieth time.

-------------------------------------------------

Shampoo was late.

The huge crowd of boys, and several girls, that counted 
themselves in the lavender haired Amazons newly formed fan 
club observed this in a state of near panic.

Where was she?

Where was their new goddess?

Where was their precious Shampoo?

And who the heck was the person standing right in front of 
them wearing a grocery bag on their head?

&quot;I must ask,&quot; the grocery bag person said in low tones that 
crinkled because of the paper of the bag. &quot;Do any of you know 
the girl known as Shampoo?&quot;

Their reaction took only an instant.

&quot;Shampoo is our goddess!&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s the sexiest girl ever!&quot;

&quot;We worship the ground that she walks on!&quot;

&quot;Her voice is the sound of the heavens itself!&quot;

&quot;Viva Shampoo!&quot;

The person wearing the grocery bag laughed a very pleased and 
crinkling sounding laugh at this. &quot;Very good,&quot; they said. &quot;I&#39;m 
here to tell you how you may help Shampoo be a happier person. 
Would you like me to tell you how?&quot;

&quot;Yes, tell us!&quot;

&quot;Tell us now!&quot;

&quot;But tell us your name first!&quot;

&quot;Yeah and how you know Shampoo!&quot;

The person wearing the grocery bag paused at this and seemed 
nervous before they said in crinkling tones, &quot;My name is... 
err... Grocery Bag... yes, Grocery Bag! And I come from the 
same village as Shampoo back home in China!&quot;

&quot;Your name is Grocery Bag?!&quot;

&quot;What sort of name is that?!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a really sucky name!&quot;

&quot;Yeah! Were your parents slow?!&quot;

Grocery Bag seemed to scowl at this then waved their fist 
around and said, &quot;Enough about my name! I thought you wanted 
to know how to make Shampoo happy!&quot;

&quot;We do! We do!&quot;

&quot;Please, tell us!&quot;

&quot;Okay, then,&quot; said Grocery Bag in crinkling tones. &quot;It might 
not seem like it but Shampoo is very lonely. She wants love and 
affection but in our tribe we have rules. In order to date 
someone they must first defeat you in battle. But here in Japan, 
fighting isn&#39;t nearly as acceptable as back home and Shampoo 
isn&#39;t sure if anyone will end up challenging her.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll challenge Shampoo to a fight!&quot;

&quot;Not just once, but every day!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll all fight her!&quot;

&quot;Yes, we fight for Shampoo!&quot;

&quot;Endlessly, forever, and every day!&quot;

Observing as the crowd got themselves riled up, the person known 
as Grocery Bag gave a low crinkling sounding chuckle before they 
bounded away from Furinkan High.

About a mile away, the person called Grocery Bag removed their 
namesake and revealed the always ravishing features of the 
girl that her group of obsessive fans knew as Chocolate.

&quot;Shampoo,&quot; said Chocolate who was she tucking the grocery bag 
that she&#39;d worn into subspace. &quot;I&#39;ve done it. I&#39;ve given you 
the key to your happiness. Surely when Tatewaki sees just how 
many admirers that you have he&#39;ll get jealous and claim you as 
his own. And even if he doesn&#39;t, maybe you&#39;ll find a strong Airen 
in that group of nutcases.&quot;

Wearing a satisfied and glowing smile, Chocolate bounded onto 
another rooftop as she said, &quot;I&#39;m so proud of myself. I&#39;m really 
and truly helping Shampoo out!&quot;

Sometimes it&#39;s the people who are trying to do good deeds that 
are the most dangerous of all.

------------------------------------------------

Chushin Maseo looked over his group of loyal followers and 
cleared his throat.

&quot;Everyone,&quot; Maseo said in grave tones. &quot;We have a new member to 
our group. Someone who is rare amongst us all. Someone who has 
not only seen but talked to the glorious example of womanhood 
that we know as Chocolate.&quot; Taking a dramatic pause, Maseo 
extended his arm before he said with flourish, &quot;Behold our 
other goddess! Tendo Akane!&quot;

&quot;Hi guys,&quot; said Akane brightly as she smiled at the fifty or so 
wide eyed guys staring at her. &quot;I totally agree with you! 
Chocolate is the prettiest girl ever and she&#39;s really nice!&quot;

&quot;Akane,&quot; pronounced Maseo solemnly before he clasped her shoulder. 
&quot;Welcome to the Chocoholics.&quot;

A few miles away, the girl once known as Mousse but now known as 
Chocolate, much to her own personal chagrin, felt a chill run 
down her spine without knowing why.

But she did know that it couldn&#39;t mean anything good.

No, it couldn&#39;t mean anything good at all.
