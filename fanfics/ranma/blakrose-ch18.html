<h1>Black Rose, Blue Thunder (part 18 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/blakrose-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>	The village of Joketsuzoku wasn&#39;t quiet anymore.

	In fact, it hadn&#39;t been quiet ever since those male outsiders 
arrived wanting to speak to Grocery Bag.

	Most of the villagers were content to let the weakling 
farmer handle his own problems. After all, his crop wasn&#39;t a big 
one and he spent most of his time in pursuits that they found 
entirely ludicrous.

	Things like studying foreign literature and languages. And 
honestly, of what possible use were they?

	But not everyone was willing to ignore Grocery Bag&#39;s 
plight. In fact, there was a very important and much feared 
someone who paid attention to it and as soon as the information of 
his troubles came to her awareness she set off to go help the 
farmer with his unexplainable woes.

	And this person just happened to be one of the strongest 
and scariest Amazon warriors in the tribe. And she also just 
happened to be Grocery Bag&#39;s girlfriend.

	And she also just happened to be the very over protective 
sort when it came to her boyfriend&#39;s welfare.

	This meant nothing good for the male outsiders.

	Nothing good at all.

	At least, nothing good from what the other villagers could 
see as they watched the outsiders flee with all of their might from 
an enraged Supermarket.

	&quot;Run away, run away!&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m running, I&#39;m running!&quot;

	&quot;That&#39;s a woman?! No way!&quot;

	&quot;Maybe she&#39;s on steroids or something!&quot;

	&quot;I say she&#39;s a mutant! Mutie freak, die!&quot;

	&quot;Hey! Are you on the side of the Sentinels?!&quot;

	&quot;The what-a-nels?!&quot;

	&quot;The Sentinels! I knew it! You destroyed the X-Men, 
didn&#39;t you?! It was you all along, Yoshi!&quot;

	&quot;I didn&#39;t do nothin&#39;! And my ovaries still hurt!&quot;

	&quot;DAMMIT YOSHI!&quot;

	As the outsider males continued in their strange 
conversation, which Supermarket couldn&#39;t understand in the 
slightest, they failed to notice that their pursuer had taken a short 
cut so she might cut them off at the pass.

	Well, they didn&#39;t notice until she did cut them off at the 
pass and stood in front of them to glare at them with fierce eyes.

	And with various shrieks of horror, the outsiders found 
themselves flying into the air after experiencing a beating that was 
possibly worse than Shampoo&#39;s.

	&quot;&lt;That takes care of that,&gt;&quot; said Supermarket in smug 
tones as she dusted her hands off. Turning to look at her boyfriend 
whom she sensed was watching her from a safe distance, she said, 
&quot;&lt;Feeling better, honey?&gt;&quot;

	&quot;&lt;Much,&gt;&quot; said Grocery Bag sheepishly. He paused to 
look into the sky and noticed the trajectory that Supermarket had 
punched the outsiders into. Giving a slight chuckle, he said, &quot;&lt;Now 
that was mean of you.&gt;&quot;

	&quot;&lt;What?&gt;&quot; Supermarket asked playfully as she arched an 
auburn eyebrow. &quot;&lt;You don&#39;t think that they&#39;ll have fun at 
Jusenkyo and in the Musk territory? At least I was nice and 
divided their punishment into two evils.&gt;&quot;

	&quot;&lt;Evils is right,&gt;&quot; said Grocery Bag with a nod. &quot;&lt;But I 
can&#39;t help but wonder which punishment is worse. The Musk are 
sure to make slaves out of the ones that land in their territory. They 
certainly aren&#39;t material for the harem, that&#39;s for sure. And 
Jusenkyo?&gt;&quot; Grocery Bag shuddered at the mere thought of the 
place. &quot;&lt;Nothing else need be said about the accursed springs. Its 
horror is far too well known.&gt;&quot;

	&quot;&lt;Well, they deserved it,&gt;&quot; said Supermarket in stubborn 
tones as her sharp features formed a small pout of sorts. &quot;&lt;Or 
don&#39;t you think that I defended you well?&gt;&quot;

	On seeing this, Grocery Bag couldn&#39;t help but smile. 
Despite what the outsider males said, he thought his girlfriend was 
quite beautiful and not the least bit manly in appearance. How 
could anyone over six feet tall with shapely legs that seemed to go 
on forever and breasts which the word bountiful couldn&#39;t rightly 
describe possibly be manly looking? And everything Supermarket 
did was womanly. Right down to her defense of her man as she 
beat up every last one of his attackers.

	Because after all, aren&#39;t women supposed to beat up 
anyone who dares to insult their chosen man?

	Grocery Bag decided that the male outsiders just had 
some sort of mental defect that kept them from seeing the full glory 
that was his wonderful girlfriend.

	&quot;&lt;I think you defended me perfectly,&gt;&quot; said Grocery Bag 
with a smile as he hooked his arm in the taller Supermarket&#39;s. 
&quot;&lt;And I plan on showing you just how perfectly you did your job 
for the rest of the day and for the rest of the night as well. How 
does that sound to you?&gt;&quot;

	Forming a coy smile, Supermarket replied, &quot;&lt;I think that it 
sounds like I&#39;m going to have sleep in tomorrow.&gt;&quot;

	&quot;&lt;Count on it,&gt;&quot; said Grocery Bag smoothly.

	With that, the happy couple made their way back to 
Joketsuzoku which was once again peaceful with the outsider 
males finally gone from their premises.

	And with them gone, it left everyone in the village 
pondering the exact same thing: Just how long would their peace 
and quiet last this time around?

---

	&quot;I never get enough screen time.&quot;

	Turning to look at his companion, Ukyo arched a dark 
brown eyebrow and said, &quot;What do you mean, Basa? You&#39;re in 
over half of the scenes in the new movie.&quot;

	&quot;Maybe so, but you fail to notice that those scenes are 
almost always with you,&quot; Tsubasa huffed.

	The two Kung Fu stars were taking five as Kensuke set up 
the cameras for their new shot. For some reason the skies were 
rather dark and ominous looking despite the fact that it was still 
afternoon. Because of this, the director decided that this would be 
a good time to start filming one of the more dramatic fight scenes 
that took place in the film.

	&quot;And what&#39;s wrong with having scenes with me?&quot; asked 
Ukyo in droll tones. &quot;I thought that we were friends.&quot;

	&quot;We are,&quot; said Tsubasa in slight exasperation. &quot;But 
Ucchan, you have to realize that whenever anyone is in a scene 
with you the camera is always focused on you. You are the star of 
this whole production. You&#39;re Bakers Peal.&quot;

	&quot;And you&#39;re my smart and clever partner in the spy game, 
Toaster Oven,&quot; countered Ukyo with a frown.

	&quot;I&#39;m the sidekick,&quot; Tsubasa said as he rolled his eyes. &quot;I 
hardly think that&#39;s an important role, Ucchan.&quot;

	Heaving a sigh, Ukyo began, &quot;You&#39;re not the--&quot;

	&quot;Basa, c&#39;mere! We have the sidekick shot ready!&quot;

	Withering under the look that Tsubasa gave him, Ukyo 
gave his friend a sheepish smile.

	&quot;All right, I see your point,&quot; Ukyo relented. He paused and 
formed a thoughtful expression. &quot;Basa, you know how I&#39;ve been 
thinking about taking a short break from the business? What if you 
took my place starring in the Peal flicks?&quot; Forming a slow smile, 
Ukyo continued, &quot;I know that you could pull the role off.&quot;

	&quot;Me?&quot; asked Tsubasa in disbelief. &quot;You want me to play 
Bakers Peal? The character you originated? The sexiest super spy 
to ever hit the silver screen according to Kung Fu daily? You want 
me to take the role over?&quot;

	&quot;Yup,&quot; said Ukyo with a nod. &quot;How about it?&quot;

	&quot;You&#39;re crazy,&quot; said Tsubasa as he gave a shake of his 
head and grinned at Ukyo. &quot;There&#39;s no way the public would 
accept anyone other than you playing Bakers Peal, Ucchan.&quot;

	&quot;Wanna bet?&quot; Ukyo drawled.

	&quot;With you? Never,&quot; Tsubasa chuckled. &quot;I learned my 
lesson after you cleaned me out of all that money when we were in 
that American city of Las Vegas.&quot;

	&quot;Basa, hello! Sidekick scene here!!&quot;

	Ukyo smirked as he watched Tsubasa grimace. Looking 
back at his friend, Tsubasa said, &quot;Then again, you could be right. 
Maybe I would make a good Bakers Peal.&quot;

	&quot;Now you&#39;re talking buddy,&quot; replied Ukyo. &quot;Just keep up 
that kind of spirit and the role is all yours.&quot;

	Giving his head a little shake, Tsubasa walked over to 
Kensuke who was giving instructions about the sidekick fight 
scene that he was taking place in. Ukyo watched this for a moment 
before he leaned back in his chair and gazed up at the darkening 
sky above him. The air was peaceful and still and Ukyo wondered 
if that had something to do with the fact that they were filming on a 
property that was located on the farthest outskirts of Nerima.

	&quot;Quiet day,&quot; Ukyo murmured to himself.

	As he looked up at the sky, Ukyo studied the clouds 
forming together and began to mentally pick them off as certain 
people, places, or things. It was a familiar game that he used to 
play with his old girlfriend and he found it a very relaxing way to 
pass the time.

	He wondered if Nabiki liked watching clouds.

	Nabiki? What made him think of her?

	Blinking his sandalwood eyes, Ukyo pushed himself up in 
his chair and registered his last thought. Why would it matter to 
him what Nabiki liked? He didn&#39;t want to know her, he only 
wanted...

	He only wanted to use her for revenge.

	Swallowing the lump in his throat, Ukyo ignored the 
tightness in his chest and rubbed his pounding forehead instead. 
Why... why did it never hit him before? What he was doing to 
Nabiki with his plan? She genuinely seemed to like him and she 
was a nice girl... shy but nice and very confident about her ability in 
the art. In fact, in a lot of ways she was like...

	She was like his old girlfriend.

	She was like the love of his life.

	She was like the only person who ever made him happy.

	And she liked him. Just as his old girlfriend had. She really 
seemed to like him... but why did she like him? Did she only like 
him because of who he was? Because he was a movie star?

	Or was it something more?

	Whatever it was, Ukyo made up his mind right then and 
there that he was going to find out just why Nabiki liked him. And 
after he did that, he would try to figure out just why he was 
thinking about her all of a sudden.

	Suddenly, without even meaning to, Ukyo found his plan 
for revenge going awry as it turned into a quest that he himself 
didn&#39;t plan but would be far more important to him than any of his 
previous plots against Ryoga.

	Because it was a quest to find his long buried heart.

---

	Kodachi was vaguely disturbed.

	Okay, she was more than vaguely disturbed. She was 
extremely disturbed. She was severely disturbed.

	Not in the mental sense of the word or the emotional sense 
either but more in the sense that she was just, well, disturbed by 
what she saw before her.

	And what she saw before her was Ranma hunched over 
and bouncing around after a Clefairy with a strange sort of manic 
energy as she acted like a Clefairy herself.

	All in all, it made for, well, a disturbing scene.

	&quot;What...&quot; began Kodachi slowly. &quot;In the world is my 
darling Ranma doing?&quot;

	&quot;I was just about to ask you that,&quot; said Nabiki as she 
looked at Kodachi. &quot;You mean that you don&#39;t know why he&#39;s 
acting so goofy?&quot;

	&quot;I haven&#39;t the slightest clue,&quot; Kodachi murmured.

	&quot;It&#39;s the Pokefist,&quot; said Tatewaki in very solemn tones. An 
effect which was ruined by the obvious smirk of amusement that he 
was attempting to hide rather poorly.

	&quot;The Pokefist?&quot; Nabiki asked dryly.

	&quot;Yes,&quot; Tatewaki replied with a nod. &quot;The legendary and 
horrible Pokefist. It&#39;s a martial arts secret technique that has long 
been veiled in mystery and what you see Ranma doing now is all a 
part of that technique.&quot;

	&quot;So Ranma darling is doing martial arts?&quot; asked Kodachi 
with clear disbelief as she watched Ranma chase after the Clefairy 
through the Furinkan High front yard as she continued to shout 
&#39;Clefairy&#39; in kawaii tones.

	&quot;That&#39;s one way to classify it,&quot; said Tatewaki reluctantly. 
His smirk was getting wider and Kodachi was expecting him to 
break out into loud laughter very soon.

	&quot;But why is he acting this way?&quot; Kodachi pursued.

	&quot;Again, it&#39;s the Pokefist,&quot; said Tatewaki. &quot;In order to be 
trained in it one must go through massive and harsh psychological 
training that affects their mind greatly.&quot;

	&quot;Affects their mind how?&quot; asked Nabiki suspiciously. &quot;And 
how do you know all this anyway?&quot;

	As Tatewaki formed a very reluctant face at this question, 
the air was pierced by a particularly hostile shout from the Clefairy 
that Ranma was chasing as it bounded on top of the Tauros. 
Seeming to give the hulking Pokemon a plea of sorts, the Clefairy 
grabbed onto the Tauros neck and the two of them went barreling 
off into the distance.

	There was a moment of complete silence before everyone 
reacted to this turn of events.

	Well, two people reacted to it.

	Ranma and the girl that the Clefairy guy was with.

	&quot;Taroooo!&quot; wailed the girl as she bunched her hands up 
into fists. &quot;You can&#39;t leave me now! Now when I&#39;ve finally found a 
boy who loves Pokemon as much as I do! We have to get 
married, my Grandpa said so!!&quot;

	With that, the girl took after the Clefairy guy, who&#39;s name 
was apparently Taro. This left Ranma alone and looking very 
morose.

	&quot;Clefairy?&quot; said Ranma in soft and definitely pathetic 
kawaii tones as she tilted her head to one side. Her blue eyes 
narrowed then, then with a fierce nod, she called out, &quot;Fairy, 
clefairy!!&quot;

	And then promptly went running after the girl, the Clefairy 
guy, and the Clefairy guy&#39;s Tauros.

	&quot;Ranma darling!&quot; cried Kodachi in distressed tones. &quot;What 
do you think you&#39;re doing chasing after other women when you&#39;re 
like that?! You&#39;ll never get numbers!&quot;

	Sweatdropping at this comment, Nabiki nonetheless went 
after both of her always wayward friends as she muttered under 
her breath, &quot;Why me?&quot;

	&quot;As much as I despise Saotome even I must feel regret 
about his current condition,&quot; murmured Tatewaki in solemn tones. 
Giving a short and decisive nod of his head, he lifted his sheathed 
katana in the air and declared, &quot;I will follow my sister into the 
depths of hell itself!&quot;

	Watching Tatewaki dash away, Shampoo&#39;s scarlet eyes 
widened and going after him, she cried, &quot;Tachi no go into depths of 
anything without Shampoo!&quot;

	This left only four people remaining besides the usual 
Nerima onlookers. Turning to look at Siren, who was strangely 
silent, Cologne asked, &quot;You&#39;re not going after them? I thought this 
would be right up your alley.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;ve had enough excitement for one day,&quot; said Siren in 
reply. &quot;Besides, the Pokefist is something that&#39;s so idiotic even I 
can&#39;t quite take amusement in the affects it has.&quot; She then turned 
her gaze to Perfume who was sitting comfortably on Kasumi&#39;s 
shoulder. &quot;And it appears I must prepare myself for a merging.&quot;

	&quot;Tink, tink tink...&quot; Perfume muttered lowly.

	&quot;Now, Perfume,&quot; chided Kasumi as she looked at the pixie 
out of the corner of her eye. &quot;You promised that you would try 
and stop cursing. Remember?&quot;

	Flushing a bit, Perfume said in rather apologetic tones as 
her blue eyes turned doe like, &quot;Tinkkkk.&quot;

	&quot;Yes, I imagine it&#39;s a hard habit to break but it&#39;s hardly the 
sort of thing that a pretty young woman like you should be doing,&quot; 
Kasumi continued as she began her walk down the street and 
towards the Sorcery shop.

	As the pair continued in their walk, Siren and Cologne 
could faintly hear Perfume giving her own pixie versions of protests 
and finally, grudging acceptance of whatever Kasumi had to say to 
her, while Kasumi herself had even more of an air of happy 
contentment surrounding her.

	&quot;They do make a cute couple,&quot; Cologne murmured after a 
moment. &quot;I&#39;m very happy for Perfume.&quot;

	&quot;You know who else would make a cute couple?&quot; Siren 
asked as she turned a lascivious smile on Cologne.

	Rolling her eyes at this, Cologne pogoed down the street 
after Kasumi and Perfume as she said dryly, &quot;You just never know 
when to give up, do you, Siren?&quot;

	&quot;Of course I don&#39;t, Cologne-chan,&quot; Siren said in playful 
tones as she followed after the Matriarch. &quot;Where would be the 
fun in that?&quot;

---

	&quot;It&#39;s quiet.&quot;

	Following Soun&#39;s gaze, Genma gave a solemn nod of his 
head and murmured, &quot;Yes. It&#39;s very quiet.&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s never quiet in Nerima,&quot; Soun continued.

	&quot;No, it never is, is it?&quot; Genma agreed.

	&quot;I&#39;m not sure I like it this quiet,&quot; said Soun. &quot;It only means 
more trouble. Because it&#39;s always quiet before the storm. Isn&#39;t that 
how the old saying goes?&quot;

	&quot;I think so,&quot; said Genma as his eyes turned thoughtful and 
he pushed up his wire rim glasses. &quot;But just what is the upcoming 
storm that we&#39;re now awaiting?&quot;

	Before Soun could reply, a loud scream pierced the air 
and they looked up to see Happosai flying past them, high in the 
sky above and appearing very charred and just, well, generally in 
worse shape then they&#39;d seen him a very long time.

	&quot;The Master,&quot; Soun began in dim tones.

	&quot;Has been defeated?&quot; Genma finished equally dimly.

	Turning to regard each other, the two pupils of the greatest 
perverted martial artist ever burst into tears and began hugging 
each other with all of their might as they declared, &quot;At last! He&#39;s 
finally been defeated by someone!&quot;

	Parting from their hug, Genma nodded his head and said, 
&quot;It was one of the boys that did it, Tendo. I&#39;m sure of it. Our heirs 
have done the one thing that we never could and have defeated the 
evil Master for us.&quot;

	&quot;Yes, Saotome,&quot; said Soun through his tears as he nodded 
his head. &quot;We have such good children!&quot;

	&quot;The best children,&quot; Genma said with a nod. &quot;In fact, I 
would say that our children are--&quot;

	&quot;Chocolate, they&#39;re so soft!&quot;

	&quot;Don&#39;t squeeze so hard, Akane. It hurts them!&quot;

	&quot;Angels...&quot; Genma trailed off as he directed his eyes 
towards the kitchen where the outburst had come from. &quot;Ehm,&quot; 
said Genma rather nervously. &quot;Is it just me or did you also happen 
to hear that, Tendo?&quot;

	Soun couldn&#39;t reply as he was in a daze.

	&quot;Hmm,&quot; Genma murmured. &quot;Well, I guess I better get you 
out of here. Certainly you don&#39;t want to hear what else they might 
be up to in there. You are her father, after all.&quot;

	&quot;Ohh... that&#39;s nice, Akane. You have perfect technique 
once you work at it a little. Don&#39;t you see?&quot;

	&quot;Yes, I see perfectly. It&#39;s so beautiful.&quot;

	&quot;I bet you say that about all the ones you see.&quot;

	&quot;No, just yours, Chocolate. They really are the most 
beautiful ones I&#39;ve ever seen. They&#39;re wonderful.&quot;

	&quot;Oh, Akane-chan... you say the nicest things.&quot;

	&quot;Yes,&quot; said Genma, who was swallowing the lump in his 
throat as he rose to his feet and grabbed the back of a catatonic 
Soun&#39;s shirt in his hand. &quot;We should go now.&quot;

	&quot;This really does make it more fun, Chocolate.&quot;

	&quot;I told you so... isn&#39;t it sweet?&quot;

	&quot;Yes, I haven&#39;t tasted anything much sweeter.&quot;

	&quot;Isn&#39;t it fun to add things and spice it up?&quot;

	&quot;Oh yes, it&#39;s lots of fun...&quot;

	&quot;Do you want to try using the syrup now?&quot;
	
	It was just about this time that Soun finally snapped out of 
his catatonic state and went barreling into the kitchen with as much 
anger as only an overprotective father could have. Unfortunately 
for him, at the exact same time a Tauros with a Clefairy riding on 
its back went charging into the kitchen from the opposite side.

	Naturally, this caused more than a little destruction as the 
Tauros ran into Soun as it continued on its path that went through 
the Tendo home itself. Seconds after the Tauros departed, Ranma 
in her elfin form along with some girl came chasing after it. And for 
whatever reason, Ranma was on all fours and constantly saying the 
word &#39;clefairy&#39; as she went on her pursuit.

	But when this all cleared away, Soun warily lifted his head 
from where it was stomped into the kitchen floor and gazed up at 
Akane and Chocolate.

	Akane and Chocolate holding bowls of ice cream.

	Akane and Chocolate with their faces covered in whipped 
cream and bananas.

	Akane and Chocolate looking quite innocent.

	With a loud groan, Soun allowed his head to hit the floor 
with a thump as he moaned, &quot;I have such good girls...&quot;

	&quot;Daddy?&quot; asked Akane as she blinked. Turning to regard 
Chocolate, she asked, &quot;Do you have any idea what just happened 
here? Or are you just as lost as me?&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m lost, Akane-chan,&quot; replied Chocolate, who wore a 
wry expression on her face as she looked at Soun.

	&quot;Well,&quot; Akane said thoughtfully. &quot;At least they can&#39;t blame 
me for the kitchen being destroyed this time.&quot;

	&quot;Yes, that&#39;s something,&quot; said Chocolate sheepishly.

	&quot;Ranma darling! Which way did you go?!&quot;

	Coming to a halt inside the destroyed kitchen, Kodachi 
looked at Akane and Chocolate then demanded, &quot;Have you seen 
my dearest Ranma? I know that he went this way!&quot;

	&quot;He was following the bull,&quot; said Chocolate. Moving to 
point out of the collapsed wall, she continued, &quot;They went that way 
if I&#39;m not mistaken.&quot;

	&quot;Thank you ever so,&quot; said Kodachi before she went 
running through the collapsed wall in search of Ranma.

	&quot;Akane! Did you do this?!&quot;

	Turning to regard Nabiki, who was glowering at her, 
Akane jumped slightly into the air and then said in rather huffy 
tones, &quot;It wasn&#39;t me this time! The big bull that Ranma&#39;s busy 
chasing did it!&quot;

	Before Nabiki could reply, Ranma&#39;s piercing cry of, 
&quot;CLEFAIRY!!!&quot; at the top of her lungs filled the air.

	&quot;Oh no,&quot; said Nabiki under her breath. &quot;What now?&quot;

	&quot;Saotome appears to have become enraged,&quot; Tatewaki 
said as he once again appeared out of nowhere causing everyone 
to jump noticeably into the air.

	&quot;Enraged about what?&quot; Nabiki wondered.

	&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; murmured Tatewaki. His tawny eyes 
darkened as he rested his hand on his katana before striding out of 
the destroyed kitchen. &quot;But whatever it is, it cannot be good. That 
much I know for certain.&quot;

	&quot;Aiyaah,&quot; Shampoo breathed while she bounded after 
Tatewaki with her usual energy. &quot;Tachi sounds too too serious. 
This not so good, Shampoo is thinking.&quot;

---

	When Nabiki ran into the sitting room, she was met with 
the site of Ryoga standing in front of Ranma and scowling deeply 
as he shook his finger at her.

	&quot;Ranma,&quot; said Ryoga in a big brotherly voice that was 
accented with scolding tones. &quot;How many times have I told you 
that just because you want to play with other Pokemon doesn&#39;t 
mean they want to play with you.&quot;

	&quot;Clefairy! Fairy!&quot; Ranma responded with the same kawaii 
tones as before while she formed an equally kawaii pout. She then 
attempted to get around Ryoga and near the Clefairy which was 
still sitting on the Tauros back. Both were standing in the yard, well 
away from Ranma.

	&quot;Ranma... no,&quot; Ryoga said strongly. &quot;Be good!&quot;

	&quot;Clefaiiiiiiry,&quot; whined Ranma who was now pouting 
severely as she gently pulled at Ryoga&#39;s pants legs.

	&quot;Amazing,&quot; said Tatewaki softly, breaking the spell of 
silence that surrounded the group who&#39;d just entered the living 
room. &quot;Ryoga-kun can actually control him now.&quot;

	&quot;Oh, hey you guys,&quot; said Ryoga sheepishly as he diverted 
his attention from Ranma to the group. &quot;I didn&#39;t see you there.&quot; 
Rubbing the back of his head, he asked, &quot;Ranma hasn&#39;t caused any 
big problems, has he?&quot;

	&quot;Well, not really,&quot; Nabiki began slowly. &quot;But--&quot;

	Nabiki was abruptly cut off as Ranma made a sudden mad 
dash around Ryoga and pounced towards the Clefairy in the yard 
whose eyes immediately went wide. It seemed like time froze as 
the Clefairy raised it&#39;s tiny hands into the air and then, much like 
before with Happosai, a massive explosion sounded. But this time, 
Ranma was the victim of the all too destructive and powerful blast.

	The blonde elf went flying high into the atmosphere and as 
she did, the Clefairy heaved a sigh of relief and muttered lowly, 
&quot;Fairy, clefairy. Fairy.&quot;

	&quot;Ranma darling!&quot; cried Kodachi in panicked tones while 
she rushed out into the yard. Turning to glare at the Clefairy, she 
shouted, &quot;How dare you do that to him!&quot;

	&quot;Don&#39;t yell at my Taro-kun!&quot; intervened Akari, who 
appeared in front of Tauros as to block Kodachi&#39;s path. &quot;He was 
just doing what he had to do in order to protect himself from 
you&#39;re whacked out girlfriend!&quot;

	&quot;Well, your Taro-kun just possibly injured my precious 
Ranma darling!&quot; said Kodachi hotly. &quot;And for that he cannot be 
forgiven! He must be punished as well!&quot;

	&quot;No one punishes Taro-kun but me!&quot; Akari replied rather 
fiercely. So fiercely that the Clefairy, whose name was apparently 
Taro, couldn&#39;t help but shudder at it.

	Fortunately or unfortunately, their would be battle was 
interrupted by Ranma landing square in the middle of the two girls 
with a thunderous crash.

	&quot;Clefairyyyyy...&quot; Ranma moaned from the large crater she 
was sprawled out in the middle in.

	&quot;Ranma dearest!&quot; Kodachi said quickly as she sprinted 
into the crater and cradled Ranma in her arms. &quot;Are you all right? 
Do you have any injuries?&quot;

	A splash sounded and a husky male voice met Kodachi&#39;s 
ears as it said, &quot;She should be fine in awhile. My metronome 
attack is fairly harmless against humans. Not at all like the 
devastating effect it has on Pokemon.&quot;

	Turning her head, Kodachi looked up into the handsome 
features of the boy she knew was the one that turned into a 
Clefairy, and frowned deeply. &quot;You didn&#39;t have to do this to him,&quot; 
she accused. &quot;Ranma obviously wasn&#39;t in his right mind just now. 
Surely you could have implied better methods to divert his odd 
attentions.&quot;

	&quot;Maybe,&quot; admitted Taro. &quot;But to be honest, she was 
starting to scare me a bit. I&#39;m used to seeing kawaii things, being 
around Pokemon all my life and all, but she was just being TOO 
kawaii if you know what I mean.&quot;

	&quot;He gets like that sometimes,&quot; Ryoga said with a sigh. &quot;It 
really isn&#39;t his fault though.&quot; Tatewaki coughed at this statement 
and Ryoga looked sheepish. &quot;Okay, so maybe it is his fault but 
still... I can&#39;t blame him really.&quot;

	&quot;Understandable, Ryoga-kun,&quot; said Tatewaki as he 
formed a wry smile. &quot;Even I can&#39;t blame Saotome for this.&quot;

	&quot;Blame him for what?&quot; asked Nabiki.

	&quot;Exactly as Nabiki darling said,&quot; Kodachi pursued, her 
arms still around an unconscious Ranma. &quot;What exactly are all of 
you discussing and why isn&#39;t Ranma to blame if this is his fault? I&#39;m 
not sure that I understand.&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s a long story,&quot; Ryoga said as he sighed again. &quot;But 
basically, Ranma, Dad, and I found this old booklet when we were 
cleaning out our attic a few years ago. It was filled with tons of 
secret techniques for the Anything Goes school. We saw this one 
technique, the Pokefist. It sounded pretty dangerous but powerful 
as well, so--&quot;

	&quot;Genma forced Ranma dearest to learn it!&quot; Kodachi broke 
in as she formed a fierce scowl. &quot;It would be like that devil to do 
such an evil thing to my darling!&quot;

	&quot;Hey!&quot; exclaimed Genma as he pulled a Tatewaki and 
popped out of nowhere, frightening everyone in the process. &quot;I 
didn&#39;t make the boy do anything! Frankly, I&#39;m insulted that you&#39;d 
think I&#39;d make him learn something as useless and stupid as the 
Pokefist! If I was going to have him learn a dangerous technique 
that psychologically scarred him then it would at least be a useful 
one!&quot;

	&quot;Uhm... that didn&#39;t sound so good, Dad,&quot; said Ryoga as he 
stared at his father blankly.

	&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; said Genma in dim tones.

	&quot;Anyway,&quot; Ryoga continued. &quot;We found the booklet and 
we saw the technique called the Pokefist that was supposed to 
give the human that masters it the powers of any Pokemon that 
they happen to run across. But,&quot; he paused to shake his head. 
&quot;There was one flaw to the technique that Ranma never got to 
since... well...&quot;

	&quot;He never read the warning page,&quot; Tatewaki intervened on 
behalf of his best friend who obviously couldn&#39;t say the words that 
would insult his brother.

	&quot;You is kidding,&quot; said Shampoo dryly.

	&quot;I wish,&quot; said Ryoga in bemused tones. &quot;And so does 
Ranma. Because... well... the warning page says that the technique 
has been proven not to work and it also ends up psychologically 
scarring the person who learns it.&quot;

	&quot;Scar them how?&quot; asked Kodachi, who was loosening her 
hold on Ranma as she heard the story.

	&quot;Instead of learning the techniques and attacks of the 
Pokemon they meet the person just ends up acting like them,&quot; said 
Ryoga as he refused to meet Kodachi&#39;s eyes. &quot;It basically makes 
them think that they&#39;re Pokemon.&quot;

	Everyone was quiet as they took this news in.

	&quot;So...&quot; began Nabiki after a moment. &quot;This technique 
Ranma learned doesn&#39;t help him in the slightest when it comes to 
the martial arts and it makes him think that he&#39;s a Pokemon and act 
annoyingly kawaii also?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s pretty much it,&quot; Ryoga nodded.

	There was another moment of silence before everyone 
broke out laughing.

	Well, everyone but Kodachi.

	Because she was frowning severely.

	Frowning severely at Ranma.

	Pushing back some stray strands of light blonde hair, 
Kodachi looked into Ranma&#39;s elfin features then said, &quot;Darling... 
sometimes you can just be so terribly unwise in your decisions. It 
really is a very perplexing trait of yours.&quot;

	&quot;Whoo,&quot; said Taro as he took in a big breath of air. &quot;I 
haven&#39;t laughed that hard in a long time. So,&quot; he turned to regard 
Ranma in the crater he&#39;d help create. &quot;How do you make her snap 
out of this Pokefist thing? I don&#39;t want her chasing me around 
everywhere when I&#39;m a Clefairy.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; Akari chimed in, hanging onto Taro&#39;s arm as the 
exotic boy looked rather surprised at this gesture. &quot;I don&#39;t want her 
going near my Taro-kun like this.&quot;

	&quot;Well,&quot; said Ryoga thoughtfully as he rubbed the back of 
his head. &quot;The only people who are able to snap Ranma out of the 
Pokefist are our--&quot;

	&quot;NO! Not them! I&#39;ll get spanked!&quot; Genma wailed.

	Needless to say, everyone present was staring at Genma 
with strange expressions after he said this.

	&quot;Spanked?&quot; Ryoga blinked. &quot;What for?&quot;

	&quot;Jusenkyo!&quot; cried Genma as he rushed forward to grab 
onto Ryoga&#39;s waist. &quot;Have mercy on your father and don&#39;t call 
them! Just leave your brother like this! He seems happy enough 
thinking he&#39;s a Pokemon, doesn&#39;t he?!&quot;

	&quot;But--&quot; Ryoga began again.

	&quot;Spanked!&quot; Genma interrupted loudly.

	&quot;But--&quot; Ryoga tried once more.

	&quot;Spanked!!&quot; Genma enforced louder.

	&quot;But--&quot; Ryoga kept on trying.

	&quot;SPANKED!!!&quot; Genma shrieked madly.

	This went on for several minutes before Nabiki finally grew 
tired of the odd almost conversation and then produced a mallet 
out of nowhere and hit Genma on the top of his head with it.

	Watching Genma topple over on the ground, Nabiki 
returned the mallet back into pocket space and directed her gaze 
to her iinazuke. &quot;So,&quot; Nabiki said. &quot;Who are these people who can 
snap Ranma out of this?&quot;

	&quot;Our mothers,&quot; said Ryoga with a sigh.

	&quot;Your mothers?&quot; echoed Nabiki.

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ryoga nodded. &quot;They&#39;re the only people that 
Ranma is scared enough of and respects enough to snap out from 
under the Pokefist influence for. It&#39;s actually a pretty funny thing to 
watch when it happens.&quot;

	Considering this for a moment, Nabiki finally gave Ryoga 
an easy smile then said, &quot;Then what are we waiting for? Lets go 
give them a call and tell them they have some snapping out of to 
do.&quot;

	&quot;Right,&quot; said Ryoga as he smiled.

	&quot;I mean, after all,&quot; Nabiki continued as they walked into 
the house and past Genma&#39;s passed out form. &quot;How bad could 
they possibly punish your father?&quot;

---

	Several hundred miles away, Hibiki Atsuko sneezed loudly 
and her companion, Saotome Nodoka, looked at her with certain 
concern. The two women were having their usual light lunch in the 
sitting room as they enjoyed the splendid view of the family 
gardens.

	&quot;You aren&#39;t getting a cold, are you?&quot; asked Nodoka. &quot;I&#39;m 
still not sure you&#39;re recovered from that jaunt in Alaska after trying 
to find our linen closet.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Atsuko replied irritably as she rubbed her nose. 
&quot;I&#39;m just getting sick of waiting for Genchan and the boys to come 
back home. They must have found Ryochan by now. He never 
gets himself lost for too long.&quot;

	&quot;But that was when he was a boy,&quot; Nodoka reminded 
while she poured Atsuko another cup of tea. &quot;Hibiki directional 
skills or lack thereof tend to worsen as they get older, you realize.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, I realize,&quot; grumbled Atsuko. Taking the tea, she 
took a slow sip of it then said, &quot;I&#39;m proof of that, aren&#39;t I? It&#39;s 
just... I&#39;ve got a bad feeling. Like Genchan did something that we 
wouldn&#39;t approve of.&quot;

	&quot;He&#39;s always doing that,&quot; Nodoka chuckled.

	&quot;True,&quot; said Atsuko rather fondly.

	&quot;You worry too much, Atchan,&quot; said Nodoka as she 
poured her own cup of tea. &quot;What will be will be. And besides, 
how bad could his mistake possibly be? I&#39;d like to think that he&#39;s 
been well trained from marrying us both.&quot;

	Considering this while she took another sip of her tea, 
Atsuko could swear that she heard a crash of ominous thunder 
sound directly after Nodoka said this.

	Which wasn&#39;t a very good sign in her opinion about exactly 
what kind of mistake their husband made this time.

	No, not good at all.
