<h1>The Power of Dreams (part 4 of 5)</h1>

<a href="../ranma/powdream-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Morning in the Tendo Dojo, the home of the Tendo and Saotome families. 
As the morning sun rose, the house was filled with bright warm sunlight, 
acting like a natural wake up call those inside, unfortunately, it only 
ever worked on one member of the family. 

Kasumi had been up since sunrise, merrily doing her usual chores, and it 
wasn&#39;t until about breakfast time before anyone else started to stir. 
Genma, Soun and Nabiki were up and had trudged themselves to the 
breakfast table ready to be served yet another world-class meal from the 
eldest Tendo daughter. 

Genma and Soun were dressed in their training robes, they were going to 
do some sparring in the dojo after breakfast, and Nabiki was in her 
school uniform, ready for another day of money-making opportunities 
between her lessons. As Kasumi served them their meal, the conversation 
around the table was unusually light. It was because the table felt 
empty. Both Akane and Ranma were missing. Ranma had been bedridden for 
some days, and Akane was supposingly up in the mountains. Now the room 
was missing the usual noises of the morning. The fiancees would usually 
have something to fight or argue about at this hour, with a mallet 
hidden under the table, but now.... there was silence, and the others 
didn&#39;t know what to think. 

&quot;It&#39;s very quiet this morning.&quot; Remarked Soun, his voice echoing several 
times around the empty room. &quot;Well...that&#39;s because there&#39;s not as many 
people here...&quot; Said Kasumi with her usual cheerful voice. &quot;Yes, mostly 
because Ranma isn&#39;t here. How is he Kasumi?&quot; Asked Genma while his mouth 
was half filled with breakfast. &quot;I think he&#39;s fully recovered now. Why 
don&#39;t I go and fetch him down for breakfast? I&#39;m sure he&#39;d love to get 
up from bed.&quot; 

The eldest Tendo began to make moves to the stairway, but was 
immediately stopped in her tracks...by the sound of approaching 
footsteps. &quot;Ah, there&#39;s Ranma now.&quot; Commented Kasumi cheerfully, only to 
have her smiling face replaced by a slightly confused one. It sounded 
like there was at least four people coming down the stairs. This caught 
everyone&#39;s attention, turning their heads towards the stairway. The 
sight, was a surprise to say the least. 

Four people entered the room: A smiling, *very* happy Shampoo, an 
equally happy looking Ukyo, a shy and embarrassed looking Akane, and...a 
very dazed and confused looking male Ranma, who needed the girls to keep 
him standing, he was too dazed to stay afoot. Ranma&#39;s presence wasn&#39;t 
much of a surprise to them, but the girls were supposed to be gone for a 
few more hours, and seeing them all together like that, smiling, in the 
Tendo home, at *this* hour? It was all very unusual. &quot;W..welcome home 
Akane. I wasn&#39;t expecting you &#39;till this evening.&quot; Said Soun, not really 
sure what to say here. &quot;We came back early father, we had something 
important to do.&quot; Replied Akane softly, burning with embarrassment for 
some unknown reason. 

&quot;...and Shampoo, Ukyo, you two are very welcome as well..&quot; Continued 
Soun, still trying to work this out in his head. &quot;Thank you Mr. Tendo, 
it&#39;s really important to us that we&#39;re welcome here, especially now.&quot; 
Replied Ukyo warmly. Just then, Kasumi jumped into action. &quot;Oh my, where 
are my manners, I&#39;d better set some extra places at the table. &quot;Oh, 
Kasumi, you really don&#39;t have to.&quot; Stated Ukyo, trying her best to not 
be a imposition. &quot;Oh, but I insist.&quot; Said Kasumi with a broad smile on 
her face. Kasumi appeared to really want the girls to stay here, and 
also appeared to know more than she was letting on. There was little on 
the surface to imply that Kasumi knew anything. But her grin gave her 
away, and her father knew her well enough to read her face. &quot;Kasumi...do 
you know something about all this?&quot; Asked her father, when she was about 
to leave the room. &quot;Pardon? Oh I....emm, no, I, just.....need to go to 
the kitchen now I&#39;ll be back in a minute.&quot; Replied his eldest daughter 
with a touch of embarrassment on her voice while she quickly made her 
way out of the room. This only helped to increase Soun&#39;s curiosity. 

&quot;Akane....&quot; Asked Soun suspiciously. &quot;...what is Kasumi so embarrassed 
about?&quot; Akane&#39;s face lit up even brighter, her moment of truth was here, 
and she too embarrassed to speak. &quot;Go on Akane, you wanting to say this 
to him for so so long!&quot; Said Shampoo supportively with a smile. Upon 
hearing that, Akane swallowed her pride and stood beside Ranma before 
speaking. 

&quot;Father....&quot; She said, with her stomach full of butterflies. &quot;....I&#39;ve 
decided. I&#39;m...going to marry Ranma....&quot; 

Kasumi stopped in her tracks and turned back with wide eyes of 
excitement. Nabiki just sat there in shock with some half-eaten noodles 
hanging from her mouth. And as for the fathers, as soon as what Akane 
had said set in, they were jubilant. They jumped to their feet and gave 
each other a high-five followed by a triumphant &quot;YES!!&quot;. They had 
finally succeeded in bringing their families together. Unfortunately, 
that jubilant attitude wouldn&#39;t last, Akane hadn&#39;t finished speaking. 

&quot;...I&#39;m going to marry him.....with my girlfriends, Shampoo and 
Ukyo....&quot; 

The very second Akane finished saying that, Nabiki began to choke on 
food she was eating. Both fathers had similar reactions, and became a 
pair of human statues, stuck in the jubilant pose they had made only 
seconds ago. &quot;Oh.....oh my....&quot; Commented Kasumi softly, trying her best 
to hide a growing smile behind her hand. It took a few more seconds for 
this all to sink in to the minds of the household, before the reactions 
came. 

&quot;C...Could you repeat that please Akane?&quot; Asked Soun, hoping that he had 
misheard his daughter. &quot;I&#39;m going to marry Ranma, and Ukyo, and 
Shampoo.&quot; &quot;You want to marry the girls as well? Why?&quot; Asked Genma. This 
was almost too much for the youngest Tendo, butb she had to keep going. 
She had wanted to say this for a very long time, and now, now she could 
tell them. &quot;Father, everyone, I&#39;ve kept this from you for, ohh, I don&#39;t 
know, forever. I&#39;m.....I&#39;m.....(I&#39;m lesbian).&quot; Soun was horrified. 
&quot;WHAT?!! But.....but....but....but.....you want to marry Ranma! How 
could you be one of those if you want to be with him?!&quot; Her father&#39;s 
reaction had managed to upset her, and so she began to sob. &quot;It&#39;s just, 
it&#39;s.....(sniff) I....&quot; 

When it appeared that Akane was about to break down in tears, Ukyo 
stepped in and held her. &quot;What Akane is trying to say Mr. Tendo, is that 
Ranma is the only man she loves. But she mostly likes to be with girls, 
and Ranma can become a girl too, it&#39;s one of the things that makes him 
so special to us. Shampoo and myself have just learned our true 
sexuality, we&#39;re lesbian too, but we love Ranma.&quot; Just then Akane got it 
back together and could speak again. 

&quot;Shampoo and Ukyo are my girlfriends father! I love them! I want to stay 
with them! They&#39;re part of me now....&quot; Akane&#39;s bust of emotion gave Soun 
a lot to think about. Himself and Genma sat down again; they had to 
think about all this. &quot;Ranma....what do you have to say about this?&quot; 
Asked Genma sternly. &quot;..haj...ii... buuu...ma?&quot; Replied Ranma in 
gibberish. &quot;What the? What was that son?&quot; 
&quot;Heed...all.....fi..fo...rar...rar...pop!&quot; After finishing more 
gibberish, he collapsed backward into Shampoo&#39;s hold. &quot;What the hell?!! 
He was alright last night! What did you girls *do* to him?!&quot; Demanded 
Genma. 

All three girls looked at each other with a grin and a smile while 
memories of last night came flooding back. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Last Night. 

The girls, who were naked, had surprised Ranma in bed and had ambushed 
him with a basin of water, turning Ranma into a girl. They took Ranma&#39;s 
bedcover, leaving only her boxer shorts to cover her pride. Then they 
lay over her pinning her onto the bed. Ukyo and Shampoo lay on both 
sides of her, and Akane lay over her. 

&quot;What do you mean? What if I don&#39;t marry you? What&#39;ll happen?&quot; Asked 
Ranma. Ukyo smiled and looked over to Shampoo. &quot;Wanna field this one 
sugar?&quot; &quot;Hee! Hee! With pleasure Spatula girl! Ranma.....we three Airens 
are now a Trinity of Love. We are a union of heart and destiny, and our 
goal is to love you. A minute ago we all gave you a Kiss of Death, the 
Marriage Kiss. We have begun the marriage rite which Shampoo began years 
ago with the first Kiss of Death I gave you. Now Ranma must marry us, 
otherwise....your curse....will get worse!&quot; &quot;W...worse?&quot; Ranma-chan 
didn&#39;t like the sound of this. &quot;...yes Ranma. Worse. Ranma&#39;s curse will 
cause Ranma to bleed like a girl!&quot; Shampoo&#39;s broken Japanese managed to 
confuse Ranma yet again. &quot;..bleed like a girl?&quot; Ukyo butted in with a 
translation. &quot;What she&#39;s trying to say Ranchan, is that if you betray 
our marriage proposal you will start to have periods, just like us!&quot; 
Ranma was horrified. &quot;I&#39;ll....I&#39;ll.....huh! No big deal! I&#39;m only a girl 
some of the time!&quot; 

&quot;No....Ranma doesn&#39;t understand!&quot; Corrected Shampoo. &quot;Ranma will bleed 
like a girl, even when Ranma is a boy! Hee! Hee!&quot; Ranma was truly 
horrified now. &quot;You mean....I&#39;ll start peeing blood every month?!!!&quot; 
&quot;Not just that....&quot; Butted in Akane. &quot;...you&#39;ll also have period pains 
too!&quot; Ranma suddenly turned pale, the prospect of this was nearly too 
much. &quot;Ranchan....There is a way to avoid that happening. We love you, 
we want to be with you....Ranma.....marry us....&quot; 

Ranma looked at each girl still in shock... &quot;We need you 
Ranchan....please marry us......&quot; &quot;Shampoo needs Ranma to live! Shampoo 
wants to marry and make love!&quot; &quot;Ranma....you know how we feel....all we 
need is an answer..... what do say, will you marry us?&quot; 

Ranma lay back, trying to get all of this to sink in, looking into their 
waterlogged eyes. How could she say no to that? How could she say yes? 
But eventually she came a decision, probably the hardest snap decision 
she ever had to make. 

And so, she opened her mouth, to give them.....her answer..... 

&quot;O........ok. I&#39;ll do it. I&#39;ll marry all three of you.&quot; Said Ranma in a 
low almost defeated tone of voice. Ranma&#39;s agreement to marry wasn&#39;t a 
well thought decision, she didn&#39;t really know what to say, but &#39;yes&#39;. 
For once, Ranma wasn&#39;t strong enough, she wasn&#39;t strong enough to say 
&#39;no&#39;. It didn&#39;t take long for it to sink in with the trio of fiencees, 
and as soon as it did, their faces lit up, before they all closed in on 
Ranma to hug her. &quot;OH RANCHAN! (Thank you......thank you so much!)&quot; 
Screamed Ukyo with emotion, nearly bringing herself to tears again. 
Shampoo said something along the same lines, but...in Chinese, she had 
been too swept up with emotion to speak in Japanese, and just hiccupped 
with busts of tears and excitement. And Akane....she just held on, 
firmly but gently, hugging the female form of the guy that she loved, 
saying nothing. 

They all held onto her for a minute or so before giving their shared 
fiencee some space. Akane was a the last to let go, and as soon as she 
did she looked straight into Ranma&#39;s eyes. She looked upon Ranma with 
eyes she had never seen before the youngest Tendo daughter, they were 
eyes of pure joy. 

&quot;Thank you so much Ranchan, I promise....you&#39;ll never regret this!&quot; 
Stated the chef confidently once she had calmed down. &quot;Ukyo? You think 
it is time?&quot; Asked the Chinese girl cryptically. Ukyo gasped with 
delight upon being asked the question. &quot;You&#39;re right Shampoo, I think it 
is!&quot; This fairly broken conversation confused the part-time girl 
considerably. &quot;Time for what?&quot; Asked Ranma. By now, Akane knew what the 
girls were talking about, and so she turned to face Ranma with them, 
each girl armed, with a smile full of intent. &quot;Why....it&#39;s time that we 
make love to you....sugar.&quot; Replied Ukyo seductively. Ranma lit up with 
embarrassment while all three girls slowly got closer again. &quot;Make love? 
H...have sex? But....I&#39;m a girl now!&quot; &quot;Shampoo knows. But Shampoo LIKES 
girls! Especially sexy girls like Ranma! Hee! Hee! Hee!&quot; Said the Amazon 
in a cheeky tone of voice. 

&quot;B...but I don&#39;t know how to it as a *girl*!!!&quot; Pleaded Ranma, almost 
panicking now that the girl&#39;s heads were only a few centimetres from her 
own. They stopped their advance, a mere inch from Ranma&#39;s head. The trio 
now also wore blushes and looked upon Ranma with wide eyes of 
excitement. They just stared for a few seconds, letting their breaths 
tickle each other&#39;s face. &quot;We&#39;ll teach you Ranchan. I know your used to 
using a penis in these kinds of situations, but it&#39;s not that hard at 
all to make love to a girl without one.&quot; Reassured the cook, with a soft 
whispering tone of voice. &quot;But...thanks to all that&#39;s happened to me, 
I&#39;ve never managed to bag a girl and get her in bed, so I don&#39;t even 
have experience doing it with my-&quot; She suddenly stopped herself, the 
girls were looking at her with *very* excited faces. 

&quot;So you are a virgin?!&quot; Spouted Ukyo excitedly. &quot;Well.....(I can&#39;t 
believe this) yea....so?&quot; &quot;So....Shampoo and her new airens want to take 
virginity away! Please Ranma, let us take it. We would so so love that!&quot; 
Asked the young Amazon as softly as possible. How could she say no to 
that. Why would she say no anyway? Although Ranma wasn&#39;t too sure about 
the marriage, she did like the idea of having three beautiful girls make 
love to her. Especially since these were girls she had always fantasised 
about when she was male, and so in a more positive tone of voice, she 
agreed. 

&quot;I suppose.....there&#39;s a first time for everything. Ok, I haven&#39;t a clue 
how to do this, but let&#39;s do it anyway. I&#39;d really like to have sex with 
you girls. (Especially you girls.)&quot; That final whisper gave the girls 
the energy to make their next move. &quot;(Thank you Ranma...)&quot; Whispered 
Akane softly. &quot;(...we&#39;ll show you how much we really love you. You ready 
girls?)&quot; Both Ukyo and Shampoo nod to her, and then to Ranma&#39;s surprise, 
all three girls took hold of her boxer shorts. &quot;Why are you holding on 
to my shorts?&quot; Asked Ranma, nearly pleased they were touching her there. 
&quot;Hee! Hee! You know well that you have to be naked to have sex Ranchan! 
Now hold still while we strip you together!! Now girls!!!&quot; 

In one swift motion, all three girls made their way down Ranma&#39;s body to 
her feet dragging the shorts with them, removing them entirely. A nude 
Ranma now lay there, a little more embarrassed now, she never expected 
the girls to see her naked female form like this, she was also 
embarrassed by the way the trio just stared at her groin. &quot;Wow!..&quot; 
Announced Ukyo with surprise. &quot;...I always wondered if Ranma-chan&#39;s bush 
also changed colour and....Hee! Hee! Hee! You&#39;re a red-head all over 
sugar!!&quot; It was then that Shampoo started to rub her hands with glee. 
&quot;Ohh, Shampoo love this! How will we start?&quot; Ukyo had to think about 
this, they had only been in threesomes so far, and this was little more 
complicated. 

&quot;Well....hmmm.....I know! We&#39;ll take turns with Ranchan! And I 
think....&quot; Ukyo looks at Akane with a grin on her face. &quot;....Akane 
should be first.&quot; Akane&#39;s face lit up like a beacon upon hearing this. 
&quot;M....mmm...me? Why?&quot; Asked the Tendo girl shyly. &quot;Well you&#39;ve lived 
with Ranchan for so long and if you hadn&#39;t beaten him senseless, I&#39;m not 
sure we would have gotten together. You go first sugar. Do you mind 
waiting Shampoo?&quot; &quot;Ohh....but.....Fine, Shampoo can wait, but know that 
Shampoo can&#39;t hold in lust forever. Shampoo must love Ranma!! NOW!!&quot; 
Spouted the Chinese girl with a touch of frustration. &quot;Aww, don&#39;t worry 
Shampoo, you&#39;ll get your go. Now Akane....she&#39;s all yours! Hee! Hee!&quot; 

Akane just sat there for a few seconds, thinking about this, then took 
hold of Shampoo&#39;s head, kissed her on the cheek, and did the same to 
Ukyo. &quot;(Thank you so much....I won&#39;t forget this.)&quot; She whispered 
quietly so only the girls could hear. She then took a deep breath, 
centred herself, and began to make her way to her &quot;prize&quot;. She got on 
all fours, crawling across the bed, almost prowling like a lioness as 
she advanced over her fiencee who lay there, nervous, unsure of what was 
coming next. 

Soon Akane was over Ranma, and with as much care as she could muster she 
gently lowered herself onto Ranma&#39;s body. She just lay on her for a few 
seconds, gazing into Ranma&#39;s eyes thinking of an appropriate way to make 
love to her, and take her virginity. 

The other two girls just stood nearby watching, and while Akane and 
Ranma did nothing, Shampoo was getting a little bored, so she let out a 
soft frustrated sigh. &quot;(Grr! Shampoo not like waiting for this. Akane 
will take forever!)&quot; Whispered the girl to Ukyo, who was amused by this. 
&quot;(Aww. Can&#39;t wait Shampoo? Neither can I. Hmm. Since we&#39;re doing 
nothing-)&quot; Ukyo takes hold of Shampoo into her arms and pressed their 
bodies together. &quot;(-How about you teach me some of those Amazon 
love-making techniques?)&quot; This appeared to excite the Amazon, who 
quickly nodded in agreement. That was all Ukyo needed, and so she 
latched onto Shampoo, taking her by surprise as she began to kiss her 
deeply. The cook then leaned on the Chinese girl&#39;s soft body, putting 
her off-balance, causing them both to fall to the ground. They fell with 
a soft thud to the floor beside Ranma&#39;s bed, Shampoo taking most of the 
impact, but she was a well trained Amazon warrior, and barely even 
noticed the slight pain she had received, she was too busy kissing her 
Airen anyway. 

Both Akane and Ranma immediately took notice of them, and the part-time 
girl was amazed by what she saw. Ranma had never seen the girls kiss 
before, and she was hypnotised by the sight. &quot;(Wow. They&#39;re kissing...)&quot; 
Whispered Ranma-chan in quiet amazement. Akane smirked at the sight she 
was so use to, and so she pressed her cheek against Ranma&#39;s as they 
watched. &quot;(They&#39;re in love Ranma...)&quot; Whispered the Tendo girl. &quot;(..just 
like I&#39;m in love with them.....just like we&#39;re in love with you....)&quot; 
They faced each other. &quot;(&quot;Soon they&#39;ll start making love Ranma....It&#39;s 
so much fun, you wouldn&#39;t believe it. It&#39;s so powerful too, it took me 
by surprise when I first made love to Ukyo.)&quot; This surprised Ranma. 
&quot;(You made love to Ukyo?)&quot; Akane nodded with a smile. &quot;(Yes, she was my 
first. She was so gentle too. Since then I&#39;ve been with Shampoo, and 
both of them at once sometimes. Hee! Hee! That can be great fun too!)&quot; 

&quot;(I had no idea...)&quot; Whispered Ranma-chan quietly. &quot;(Really?)&quot; Replied 
the Tendo girl suggestively. &quot;(You mean you haven&#39;t been the least bit 
curious? I thought all guys like to fantasise about girls being together 
like this? I suppose it&#39;s because it is something they would never be 
able to experience. But you can turn into a girl Ranma. Have you really 
never dreamed of experiencing lesbian sex while you&#39;re Ranma-chan?)&quot; 
Ranma looked away from Akane, she was a little too embarrassed to face 
her right now. &quot;(Well...)&quot; She muttered nervously. &quot;(...I suppose 
there&#39;s no point in hiding it from you now. But....I have actually 
thought about it.....sometimes. But....they were only after-thoughts 
really. I knew it would be very hard to get a girl with you three 
stalking me *all* the time, and well, I didn&#39;t know if any of you were 
into that kind of thing.)&quot; 

&quot;(What? You mean you never saw the way I look at you when you&#39;re a 
girl?)&quot; Asked Akane cryptically. &quot;(Well....no. What way do you look at 
me?)&quot; The Tendo girl enjoying this immensely, she had always wanted to 
tell Ranma all this. &quot;(Well....)&quot; She replied cheerfully with a huge 
grin on her face. &quot;(....you do have a very curvy and trim body. It&#39;s 
very sexy too. You have a very *ahem*, generous chest, which I really 
love, and you ass is just right, cute like Ukyo&#39;s and tight like 
Shampoo&#39;s.)&quot; Hearing Akane talk like this began arouse Ranma in ways she 
hadn&#39;t been before. She had never been this aroused in her female form. 
&quot;(You were lesbian since I came here? How did that happen?)&quot; Asked 
Ranma, now wanting to learn more about her fiencee&#39;s sexual appetite. 
&quot;(Well...I suppose it just did. Simple as that, I like girls. ......also 
I watched a lot of Sailor Moon growing up, kinda influenced me. I&#39;m not 
sure any of those girls were straight....except Usagi.)&quot; 

&quot;(So....cartoons did it to you!)&quot; &quot;(Hee! Hee! Cartoons and girls named 
Ranma....I.....I really do.....love you, you know.)&quot; Uttered Akane, so 
filled with emotion, that she nearly couldn&#39;t say those simple words. 
And she stayed silent, her eyes fixed on Ranma, saying all that she had 
said before in a single look. Ranma was hypnotised again, and lay there 
looking back at her, until Akane began to make her decent. Ranma knew 
what was coming now, and then suddenly became frightened, this was just 
like that last time, that time Ranma was beaten to a bloody pulp. Ranma 
tensed up and it looked like she was about to pull away. Akane saw this 
and stopped. &quot;(Ranma? What&#39;s wrong?)&quot; She asked softly. &quot;(Well, it&#39;s 
...just....last time you looked at me in that way.......you-)&quot; 
&quot;(Shh...)&quot; Said Akane, gently silencing Ranma with her index finger. &quot;(I 
promise I won&#39;t hurt you...)&quot; She closed her eyes and inched her way 
closer to Ranma. Ranma looked on, unsure what to think, all she could 
see now was Akane&#39;s gentle face, and those lips. They appeared to call 
to her. 

And so in those last dying seconds Ranma&#39;s fears disappeared and she 
succumbed to the grip of Akane&#39;s lips. 

All this time they were being watched, by the other two lovers who 
stopped their kissing just for this. The very first real kiss between 
Ranma and Akane. They both let out a sigh of pleased relief when it 
finally happened. They were afraid that Ranma might of rejected her and 
lay there in each other&#39;s arms, watching in silent amazement. &quot;(Wow! 
That so cute! Shampoo loved that!)&quot; Burst the Amazon in her broken 
adopted language. &quot;(Yea. They&#39;re so good together; I can&#39;t believe I 
tried to come between them.)&quot; Replied the chef softly. A cheeky grin now 
enveloped the Chinese girl&#39;s face. &quot;(Hee! Hee! Watching Ranma and Akane 
kiss is giving Shampoo a horny!)&quot; This amused Ukyo. &quot;(Really? Looks like 
we&#39;ll have to do something about that then.)&quot; 

They both looked at each other&#39;s smiling eyes, Shampoo&#39;s smiling more 
than her girlfriend&#39;s. &quot;(Ukyo want to do something?)&quot; Asked the Chinese 
girl excitedly. &quot;(What you want to do?)&quot; &quot;(Well.....)&quot; Mused the Chef 
while she slowly and seductivly circled her index finger around one of 
Shampoo&#39;s now hardening nipples. &quot;(...I want to make love to you of 
coarse. But...I want it to be.... you know, just like the way you do it 
to me. I&#39;d love to learn one or two of those Amazon love-making 
techniques. Please....will you teach me?)&quot; Shampoo was overjoyed that 
Ukyo was so interested in this and was more than happy to teach her. 
Secretly, Shampoo had really wanted to train all of her airen&#39;s in the 
skill she had thought herself. 

&quot;(Well....Hee! Hee! Shampoo teach you. Hmm...not always easy though. 
Have to think of a good one. Hmmm........Yes! Shampoo knows one!)&quot; The 
Chinese girl frees one of her arms and then points to a spot just below 
her left breast. &quot;(Put one index finger here...)&quot; Directed Shampoo while 
trying to contain her excitment. Ukyo did as she was asked and as soon 
her soft finger set down on Shampoo&#39;s skin, the young Amazon suddenly 
trembled with pleasure. &quot;(What the? I am doing this right sugar? Aren&#39;t 
I?)&quot; Asked Ukyo, who was a little surprised by Shampoo&#39;s response. 

Shampoo nodded slightly, too drunk with pleasure to respond right now. 
&quot;Y....y....yes. Ukyo has found one of Shampoo&#39;s *special* points. Now 
get other arm and pinch Shampoo&#39;s linala.&quot; This preplexed Ukyo who wore 
a face to match that feeling while she replied. &quot;Linala? What&#39;s a linala 
Shampoo?&quot; Shampoo instantly recognised her mistake in using Amazon names 
for her anatomy. &quot;Opps! Sorry. Shampoo is too used to using Amazon words 
for this. Linala is....emm....Shampoo trying best to remember Japanese 
word.....emm.....Shampoo&#39;s....cl.... cl...clit.or..is.....clitoris?&quot; 

&quot;You want me to pinch your clit sugar? But....that&#39;ll hurt you.&quot; Replied 
the Chef, a little confused by Shampoo&#39;s request. &quot;It will be OK. 
Shampoo will be fine, just don&#39;t pinch too hard, just soft little pinch 
of Shampoo&#39;s linala and don&#39;t let go. If Ukyo play with these two spots, 
in few minutes, Shampoo will have a teetotiko!&quot; Said the young Amazon 
cheerfully, letting her language slip again. &quot;A teetotiko? I assume 
that&#39;s an orgasm. Hee! Hee! I think I prefer Amazon words for all these 
things. Ok.....here goes nothing.&quot; 

Delicatly and with as much care as she could muster, Ukyo reached her 
hand down, beneath their legs, carressing the Amazon&#39;s stomoch as she 
went. Soon her hand was resting on Shampoo&#39;s warm vulva, causing a warm 
smile to grow on the Amazon&#39;s face. Ukyo was never one to rush things so 
she just let her hand linger there for a while, rubbing Shampoo&#39;s soft 
groin with her equally soft palm and fingertips. She felt the groves and 
contours of Shampoo&#39;s genitils with her index finger increasing the 
pleasure for her girlfriend, and then she moved her fingers north 
towards the girl&#39;s &#39;Linala&#39;. 

Shampoo tingled with anticipation. Although she didn&#39;t tell Ukyo, this 
was her favourite Ryu love-making technique, which lately she had been 
practicing on herself, to great effect. And so she watched Ukyo&#39;s eyes 
carefully, reading they&#39;re intent, learning the exact moment the Chef 
would touch her, there. She could tell by the smile on her face, Ukyo 
was about to do it, and so, as delicatly as she had done everything 
else, she took her thumb and index finger, and gently grasped that small 
node of flesh with them. It was now fully erect and tingling like the 
rest of Shampoo&#39;s body. 

The effects were instant. A huge wave of powerful senstion and emotion 
flowed through the young Amazon&#39;s body with the force of a tsunami, a 
sensation far greater than any orgasm. She shivered all over from Ukyo&#39;s 
touch, and the chef couldn&#39;t help but smile at this. &quot;Hee! Hee! You 
enjoying that sugar?&quot; Shampoo couldn&#39;t respond, she may not have even 
heard Ukyo, she was drowning in the pleasure of this moment. 

================================================== 

Just beside them, Akane and Ranma were still held together by the Tendo 
girl&#39;s grip of love. She had berely even given herself time to breath, 
she was that commited to this kiss. But soon, her amorous feelings would 
increase in power. Akane had an overwhelming to go futher, and right 
now, no force on Earth could stop her from doing it. While she sedated 
Ranma with her lips, Akane slowly and delicatly slid her hand from 
behind the part-time girl, around the crest of her behind, and past her 
thigh, sending shivers of pleasure through her body. 

Akane&#39;s soft hand masssaged the skin as it went down. Although she only 
had limited experience at making love to girls, she knew exactly how 
excite Ranma-chan&#39;s senses. Soon Akane was touching her vulva, where she 
wasted no time in gaining entry. But something stopped her. It surprised 
and then excited her and this was clear on her face when stopped kissing 
Ranma in order to talk. 

Akane&#39;s fingers had entered Ranma&#39;s womanhood, but were stopped short by 
a fleshy barrier. Remarkibly, Ranma&#39;s virginity had been carried over to 
his female body, in physical form. &quot;(Ranma? Oh Ranma! I don&#39;t believe 
it!)&quot; Whispered the Tendo girl excitedly. &quot;(Wh...what? What did I do 
wrong?)&quot; Replied a confused Ranma. &quot;(Hee! Hee! Nothing! It&#39;s 
just.....Ranma...... I didn&#39;t know you could have a virginity like the 
rest of us girls.)&quot; Ranma continued to look confused. &quot;(You mean *that* 
is what that was?)&quot; Akane couldn&#39;t believe this. &quot;(Are you meaning to 
tell me you don&#39;t even know about a girl&#39;s virginity?)&quot; Ranma looked 
blankly back at her. &quot;(O....K.....Forget about that Ranma. Now....*Ahem* 
Ranma, would you like me to break it for you? I&#39;ll be very gentle.)&quot; 
Asked Akane as softly as she could, blushing while she whispered. 

&quot;(Emm....Will it hurt? It feels fairly solid.)&quot; Asked Ranma, a little 
worried about this. &quot;(Well....Yea. But only for a short while. I broke 
in both Ukyo and Shampoo, so I&#39;m fairly experienced. They told me later 
how, surprised they were, that it didn&#39;t hurt as much. You&#39;ll bleed a 
little Ranma, but that will stop shortly after. I have a way of turning 
the pain into pleasure....but it&#39;s a secret. You see....one of my 
fantasies when I first turned lesbain, was to make love to a virgin, be 
her first, and to break her in. When you came, you became that girl I 
dreampt about, as well as Ukyo later on. I learned ways to break it 
gently, and so, I deflowered myself practicing. Ukyo was my first, but 
she didn&#39;t break my physical viginity....)&quot; 

Ranma was silenlty amazed by all this, and a little perplexed by tears 
that started to gather on Akane&#39;s eyelids. The Tendo girl was filling 
with emotion now, as the reality of it all dawned on her. She was living 
out her dream, and she couldn&#39;t believe it. So here she was, with the 
girl she loved, the girl had most wanted to take a virginity from, naked 
beneath her, looking back with those endlessly deep blue eyes, she had 
fallen in love with. Ranma couldn&#39;t say no. She just couldn&#39;t it was a 
reaction now to surrender to what Akane wanted of her, and so she nodded 
causing the Tendo girl&#39;s eyes to widen with joy. Then she closed them, 
while she moved in for another kiss. 

It was all part of what she did to ease the pain she was about to cause. 
Holding her hand where it was, Akane made her middle and index fingers 
straight and rigid, and with one swift, almost merciless motion, Akane 
pushed in, breaking that barrier, and Ranma&#39;s virginity at the same 
time. Ranma instantly felt a sharp pain, but thankfully, Akane had see 
it coming and so she kissed her with even greater force. She held the 
girl tighter too and while the blood trickled from Ranma&#39;s vulva, Akane 
massaged it and fumled with the clitoris, aleaviating the pain, enducing 
pleasure instead. Akane wasted no time....and proceeded to make love to 
her. 

=================================== 

The night dragged on. It was almost as if time had stood still while 
they made love. But time waits for no man. The red haze of the morning 
sun had now invaded the horizon. Both couples finished, Shampoo 
orgasmed, she nearly screamed, it was so powerful. Akane succeeded to do 
the same to Ranma, who lay there, nearly as exaused as the Tendo girl 
who had work on the part-time girl for over over an hour to get her to 
climax. &quot;Ukyo.....&quot; Akane announced between gasps. 
&quot;It&#39;s....your.....turn.&quot; Ukyo got to her feet, she still had plenty of 
energy left in her, and so she gently picked up the semi-conscious Akane 
and placed her on top of Shampoo. &quot;There sugar, you can keep Shampoo 
company.&quot; 

Ukyo wasted no time, she immeadialty mounted Ranma and held on to her as 
tightly as Akane had. &quot;Oh Ranchan! This is it sugar. We&#39;re gonna kiss, 
and make love. (I&#39;ve dreampt of this for so long.)&quot; Ranma wasn&#39;t really 
paying attention, she was still kind of dazed from what Akane had done 
to her, it was the very first orgasm she had felt as a girl, it&#39;s power 
had totally taken her by surprise. But eventually the girl began to get 
it together. She was sort of dizzy at first, couldn&#39;t make out the face 
of the girl who lay on her. Eventualy she focused, and recognised Ukyo. 

Ukyo didn&#39;t really look the same as she usually did. Her hair was all 
messed up after playing with Shampoo, and also her face was flushed with 
her skin glistening with a coat of sweat which almost seemed to sparkle 
as the morning sun began to break the horizon. &quot;(Ukyo?)&quot; Whispered 
Ranma, a little surprised to see the chef in front of her. &quot;Yes sugar?&quot; 
She replied cheerfully. &quot;(....I don&#39;t know why but....you look much 
cuter than usual right now....)&quot; This overjoyed Ukyo. &quot;Oh Ranchan! You 
sweet little sugar! I...I don&#39;t look good at all! Hee! Hee! I&#39;m a mess!&quot; 

&quot;(Well Ucchan...you make a cute mess....)&quot; Ukyo began to blush. &quot;(Aww. 
That&#39;s probably the dumbest thing you&#39;ve ever said.....but it&#39;s also the 
sweetest.)&quot; Said the cook softly as she stroked Ranma&#39;s feminine cheek 
with her hand. &quot;(I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s happening sugar, we&#39;re actually 
gonna get married. I always believed that some part of you loved 
me....now I know it&#39;s true.... oh Ranchan, I love you....)&quot; Her hands 
began to tremble a little as inched her mouth closer to Ranma&#39;s, 
anticipating their kiss. &quot;(Ranchan.....I want to kiss you sugar, but I 
don&#39;t want to steal that kiss. Do....Do you want me to kiss you?)&quot; 

Ranma couldn&#39;t reply. Her emotions were still all over the place, but at 
least she knew this much; Ukyo had been her friend for so long now, they 
were so close that only a kiss separated them from being a couple, she 
may of even fell for Ukyo long ago, if it wasn&#39;t for all that had 
happened. She couldn&#39;t say no to her. Ranma closed her eyes, and meekly 
nodded before opening her lips a little, inviting Ukyo&#39;s kiss. The cook 
was overjoyed as eyes became moist. A dream was about to become reality. 
She closed her eyes forming a tear, before lowering those lips down, 
down to Ranma, down to her dream. 

They touched, gently, and those lips firmly pressed against one another, 
kissing. Ukyo was first to invade the other&#39;s mouth with her tongue, she 
was more experience than the uninitiated Ranma at this art, but in her 
own way she gently encouraged the part-time girl to copy her and do the 
same thing&#39;s to herself while they kissed. Ranma was understandably 
clumsy as she tried her best to get up to Ukyo&#39;s well-practiced standard 
of kissing, but the chef didn&#39;t mind, she was pleased to be teaching 
her. Eventually, when she felt the time was right, she gently let go of 
Ranma&#39;s mouth to speak. 

&quot;(Hee! Hee! You&#39;re a fast learner sugar! Now.....time for some FUN!)&quot; 
With little or any warning, Ukyo grabbed hold of Ranma&#39;s armpits and 
then after getting into a crouching position, she proceeded to throw the 
unsuspecting girl behind her in a fit of passion. Ranma hit the wall and 
then fell into a slump on the ground. Ukyo wasn&#39;t far behind, she 
somersaulted off the bed, spun around in mid-air and landed in-front of 
Ranma, facing her. The chef had a huge smile on her face, and giggling 
all the time, she was loving this. Again without saying anything, Ukyo 
grabbed hold of the guy/girl she loved and then literally threw her 
across the room towards her other two lovers. Ranma landed flat on her 
back, not far from Akane and Shampoo. 

She was too dazed to move right now, she stared at the ceiling as she 
lay there. Soon the sight of that ceiling was replaced by Ukyo&#39;s smiling 
face. Seconds after she had thrown Ranma, Ukyo jumped after her, landing 
on the girl, and pinning her arms and legs to the floor. Ranma couldn&#39;t 
move. Ukyo continued to hold her prisoner while she lowered her head 
down to Ranma&#39;s. This time she did steal a kiss, a short yet passionate 
one, but she now believe it to be ok this time, for it was a prelude to 
something much more. Her lips gently let go of Ranma again. The part-tie 
girl was about to say something, but the chef gagged her with a finger 
placed lightly on her mouth, followed by a soft &#39;Shhh&#39;. The onomiyaki 
chef grinned from ear to ear, as her ears sparkled, full of amorous 
intent. She blushed a little, before her face began to move down. 

Soon Ranma could feel Ukyo&#39;s soft lips pressed against her neck, kissing 
it lightly, leaving a moist patch of goosepimpling skin when it ended. 
Ukyo moved down some more, Ranma didn&#39;t know what to expect next, and 
she was more than a little surprised when she felt the chef&#39;s lips 
gently griped around one of her nipples. Ukyo suckled on Ranma&#39;s breast 
for a short while, providing the semi-girl with an entirely new 
sensation. She had never imagined that it would feel like that when 
someone touched her there. Once Ukyo had finished nursing of one breast 
she moved to the other, lightly kissing the skin as she went. Ranma 
anticipated Ukyo&#39;s touch this time and shivered with expectation when 
she felt Ukyo breathing over her other nipple. She didn&#39;t have to wait 
long, as gently and with as much care as she used seconds ago, she 
sucked on Ranma, almost as if she were feeding of her own mother as an 
infant. 

Once Ukyo felt the nipple harden, she knew her task was done, and so she 
moved south again, but this time, well beyond Ranma&#39;s field of vision. 
She could feel the chef kiss her on her way down, and could tell where 
she was, the last kiss coming from just above her groin. For about a 
minute, nothing happened. Ranma just lay there, imagining what Ukyo may 
be planning next, but of coarse she knew well the chef could only be up 
to *one* thing down there. She was expecting a finger or two to enter 
her soon enough....but Ukyo wasn&#39;t a very predictable mood tonight. 
Something brushed off Ranma&#39;s clitoris, causing a tremor to pulsate 
throughout her body. Was it a finger? No, it was too smooth, it was....a 
nose? Then it all made sense when she could feel Ukyo breathing on her 
loins. Just when Ranma had realised what Ukyo was up to, the chef jumped 
into action. 

She passionately kissed Ranma&#39;s vulva, treating it&#39;s lips as if they 
were the same as on her mouth, and using her tongue to lick and 
penetrate wherever it could reach. Ranma couldn&#39;t believe the sensations 
she was feeling right now, clenching her fists and tensing up every 
muscle in her body as Ukyo passionately worked on her. She was helpless 
now, a slave to the cook&#39;s touch. 

This continued for some time, Ukyo holding Ranma there, never letting 
go, making the part-time girl a prisoner to her passionate feelings for 
her. All this came to a head eventually, with each wave of pleasure that 
flowed through her body, Ranma was losing control. She was now moaning 
each time she felt that pleasure, and was staring to reach her climax. 
She was now covered in as much sweat as the brunette girl who was loving 
her now and was breathing as heavily. Then it happened, like a massive 
explosion of emotion and feeling, Ranma climaxed and also came. 

Ranma lay there with a surprised expression on her face. It felt just as 
powerful as what Akane had done to her, but she came. It was the first 
time she had done that in her female form, and the sensation of the now 
cold liquid dripping from her vulva was strange to her. She moved her 
head up to see what had happened down there, only to be met by Ukyo&#39;s 
face who had made it&#39;s way back up again. Much to Ranma&#39;s surprise, 
Ukyo&#39;s face had a lot of her ejaculate all over it. &quot;Oh no. I&#39;m so sorry 
Ukyo, that&#39;s my fault isn&#39;t it?&quot; This appeared to amused Ukyo. &quot;Hee! 
Hee! Don&#39;t worry about it Ranchan! I don&#39;t mind if it comes from you or 
the girls! It just proves I did my job right!&quot; Chuckled Ukyo before she 
licked some of it off and then used Ranma&#39;s bed covers to clean the 
rest. &quot;Now Ranchan-&quot; Announced the chef in a sad tone before sighing a 
little and then stealing a small kiss. &quot;-it&#39;s Shampoo&#39;s turn.&quot; 

Ranma was a little sad too, she had enjoyed that and wanted more from 
the chef. &quot;Do you really have to leave?&quot; Asked the half-girl 
cryptically. Ukyo smiled warmly before replying. &quot;Aww Ranchan...you 
really like that? Maybe if we get back round to me again, but-&quot; Ukyo 
then yawned out loud as her eyelids became heavy. &quot;-I&#39;m starting to get 
tired now, and the three of us agreed that once you orgasm, we have to 
pass you on.&quot; Ranma was a little perplexed by this. &quot;You girls had it 
all arranged before you came? But.....what if I had said no?&quot; Ukyo 
blushed a little. &quot;Well...Ranchan....we weren&#39;t going to take &#39;no&#39; of an 
answer, so....we were going to tie you up and make love to you anyway. 
Hee! Hee!&quot; Ranma was more than a little surprised by this. &quot;You girls 
were going to RAPE me?!&quot; Ukyo was quick to defend her position. 
&quot;Well.....&#39;Rape&#39; is such an ugly word, I prefer to think of it as 
&#39;Making Love to you without your permission&#39;, it&#39;s-&quot; Ukyo stopped 
herself after making a realisation. &quot;-ohh wait....that is rape.&quot; 

The chef suddenly turned very apologetic. &quot;Oh Ranchan, I&#39;m so sorry! I 
should of realised. I would have never let that happen to you. I don&#39;t 
want you to hate me or not trust me with your body.....I...I&#39;m so 
sorry.&quot; Ukyo was almost in tears now, realising the terrible lengths she 
would of went to, to get her own way. She couldn&#39;t look at Ranma now, 
she was too ashamed to. Ranma could tell that this was upsetting her and 
so she brushed her soft hand off Ukyo&#39;s cheek, prompting the chef to 
look back at her. &quot;Ucchan....you forget who you&#39;re talking to here. I 
wouldn&#39;t mind if you girls raped me, because I know your intentions are 
always loving (even when they injure me). So cheer up, I won&#39;t hold it 
against you, and besides, I&#39;ve always trusted you.&quot; Ukyo brightened up, 
almost as much as the morning sun, and her face reflected that. &quot;Oh, 
thank you Ranchan!!!&quot; Screamed the chef embracing her tightly, and then 
stealing another, short, yet powerful kiss. 

Just then, they were interrupted by a soft round of applause. Akane and 
Shampoo were half-awake and had been watch all this, including the end 
of their love- making. They were now clapping lightly with what little 
strength they had left giggling softly all the time. &quot;Yay! Great romance 
scene! Ukyo and Ranma are Japanese Romeo and Juliet! Hee! Hee! Shampoo 
can write big play with this material! Shampoo make millions of yens!&quot; 
The young Amazon&#39;s bubbly remarks cause the chef to blush bright red. 
&quot;Cut it out you two! You&#39;re embarrassing me!&quot; Protested the chef, not 
wanting to feel embarrassed now of all times. &quot;But Ukyo look real cutie 
when embarrassed!&quot; Countered Shampoo softly, not wanting Ukyo to feel 
anyway bad about this. 

&quot;Well then Shampoo-&quot; Replied Ukyo with a smirk. &quot;-If you&#39;re awake now, I 
guess it&#39;s your turn with Ranma. Let&#39;s see you do the same without 
getting embarrassed!&quot; As her eyes widened with excitement, the Chinese 
girl gently rolled Akane onto her back and then quickly got to her feet. 
&quot;(I&#39;ll see you later Ranchan.)&quot; Whispered the cook to her beloved, 
giving her a small, parting kiss, before she got to her feet and made 
her way over to Shampoo and Akane. &quot;She&#39;s all yours sugar, break a leg!&quot; 
Said the chef cheerfully when she reached her other two lovers. &quot;That 
not all that Shampoo break!&quot; Spouted the Amazon with a cheeky voice, and 
as she began to make her way over to Ranma, she playfully spanked Ukyo&#39;s 
behind with her hand. 

Ukyo jumps upon feeling this and quickly begins to rub her ass as she 
began to blush some more. &quot;Oww! Hee! Hee! You behave Shampoo, or I&#39;ll 
have to spank you too!&quot; Stated the chef, slightly pleased that Shampoo 
had done that to her. &quot;Really?! Spatula Girl promise?! Spatula girl use 
big spatula too?&quot; Ukyo was surprised by Shampoo&#39;s reply, but not *that* 
surprised at all really. &quot;Well...*ahem*....Ok, I&#39;ll spank you, but 
you&#39;ll have to wait, I left my big spatula at home.&quot; The Chinese girl&#39;s 
face lit up upon hearing this and then hop around on the spot excitedly. 
&quot;Yay! Shampoo can&#39;t wait!&quot; &quot;Wow sugar! I thought I knocked the wind out 
of you with that Ryu trick! How come you&#39;re so frisky now?&quot; Asked the 
chef with a surprised tone of voice. &quot;Shampoo get second wind! Shampoo 
now READY! Shampoo finally make love to Ranma! (Shampoo finally kiss 
Ranma)&quot; 

The Chinese girl dons a serious face of intent now and turns to face 
Ranma. She then marches slowly over to her first Airen. While she does 
this, Ukyo lowers herself and then gently lies down over Akane. Akane 
was nearly asleep by now, and was pleased to feel the chef&#39;s familiar 
body, pressed against her own. &quot;(Ukyo-)&quot; She whispered softly. &quot;(-how 
did it go?)&quot; &quot;(It went great sugar. Ranma reacted perfectly.)&quot; A small 
smile grew on Akane&#39;s sleeping face. &quot;(Will you....make love to me 
now?)&quot; Said Akane with an increasingly fading voice. Ukyo could now feel 
the fatigue in both of them. It had been a long day and a very long 
night, neither of them were up to another session. &quot;(Oh Akane, sugar. 
You&#39;re exhausted, and so am I.)&quot; &quot;(....but..i....want....to-)&quot; 
&quot;(Shh....rest Akane. I know the best way to put you to sleep.)&quot; 

Ukyo inched her face closer to Akane and then firmly pressed her moist 
lips against that of her young girlfriend. It was a small and innocent 
kiss, but served it&#39;s purpose. It soothing effect of Ukyo&#39;s touch and 
the fact that the kiss was cutting off some of Akane&#39;s airflow, meant 
that girl was out like a light. Ukyo then snuggled into Akane, her soft 
body was enough to lull the chef to sleep. The last thing she saw before 
she lost consciousness, was Shampoo standing over Ranma. 

================================ 

Shampoo stood there, hypnotised by what she saw, a naked Ranma-chan, 
laying exhausted on the floor, trying her best to catch her breath. Her 
Japanese fiencees had taken their toll with many hours of passionate sex 
followed by two world-changing orgasms. She would have lost 
consciousness too, if it wasn&#39;t for the powerful feelings that coursed 
through her body right now. Ukyo&#39;s touch still haunted it many minutes 
after she had left it. 

Shampoo couldn&#39;t wait, and as soon as it looked like Ranma was relaxed, 
she gently lowered herself onto her body. Now her committed face, was 
replaced by a softer and far kinder one, she wanted to try her best to 
win her airen over. Soon their bodies were pressed together and Ranma 
instantly recognised who it was. She knew the well-toned body of the 
Amazon very well. Shampoo had always been very physical with Ranma, and 
so she knew the feeling of her body, even in it&#39;s nakedness. 

&quot;(ssh......shh.....shampoo?)&quot; Whispered the girl so silently that only 
the Amazon could of heard it. &quot;(Yes Ranma? Is....is Airen all ok?)&quot; She 
asked softly. &quot;(shampoo.....i&#39;m so....tired....i can hardly keep my eyes 
open... ...I can barely speak.....I-)&quot; Shampoo gently silences her with 
her index finger. &quot;(Shh....Say no more-)&quot; Shampoo then wore a very warm 
smile. &quot;(-Shampoo not need to hear what Ranma say. Hee! Hee! Shampoo not 
fully understand anyway, Shampoo just improvises her Japanese! Aww-)&quot; 
She then begins to gently stroke Ranma&#39;s hair. &quot;(-Shampoo has been 
looking forward to this for so so long. After all the loneliness, all 
the tears that Shampoo shed for you, Shampoo finally.....Shampoo finally 
lay with you. Ohh.....Shampoo used up all her words to tell how she 
feels.... .....only one thing left to say, Ranma. But Shampoo knows only 
one way of saying it.....Shampoo knows one language that all peoples 
know, a language of the heart.....Shampoo tell you how she 
feels...(Shampoo say it with a kiss.)&quot; 

Following that emotion-filled whisper, Shampoo licked her lips, 
moistening then lightly before moving her head closer to Ranma&#39;s. Their 
lips touched and then the Amazon kissed Ranma, gently at first but with 
each passing moment, Shampoo increased the intensity of it. The Chinese 
girl savoured this, now she was finally tasting the mouth of her first 
airen. She knew she had to end it eventually, but she simply didn&#39;t want 
to let go, afraid that she wouldn&#39;t get another chance to kiss Ranma. 
She spent at least fifteen minutes kissing her airen before eventually 
letting go. She knew that the massaging action of her soft would have 
probably soothed Ranma to sleep if she had continued much longer. 

Ranma was nearly unconscious, and Shampoo could sense this. She knew 
well that her Airen was definitely not up to normal love-making, she was 
simply too weak now. But Shampoo had a plan. Ever since she had started 
learning the Ryu scroll, she had discovered a mythical love-making 
technique which was said to have been the single most powerful way of 
doing it. The Chinese girl had saved this one especially for Ranma. 
&quot;(Don&#39;t worry Ranma. Shampoo knows you are sleepy, but Shampoo will make 
love to you in a way which you will not need to do anything.)&quot; Ranma 
couldn&#39;t reply, she barely even heard what Shampoo said while she lay 
there and tried her best to keep awake. &quot;(Aww...Can&#39;t speak? No worry. 
Shampoo..... ..take good care of you.)&quot; 

She then slowly and gently moved one of her hands up, in-between Ranma&#39;s 
breasts where she touched a pressure spot. She then took her other hand 
and gently grasped her airen&#39;s &#39;linala&#39;. This looked much like Shampoo&#39;s 
favourite technique, but there was a difference. Once her hands were in 
place, Shampoo pressed her body tightly up against Ranma&#39;s. A gentle 
&#39;buzz&#39; then began through both their bodies. &quot;(Ranma....this is the 
single most powerful way to make love. Shampoo is linking her ghost with 
Ranma ghost. We become one, and while Shampoo move the hand near our 
hearts down to the hand near our linala, it get more powerful until we 
have a... ...&#39;Majiikijutu&#39;. A Ghost Teetoteko. The most powerful 
possible. Now....Shampoo begin, with a &#39;Likitana&#39;. A linking.....kiss.)&quot; 
And that&#39;s what she did, moving in for a kiss, gently holding Ranma with 
her lips. 

================================================== 

If only they knew. If only they could see what was watching them now. A 
shadowy female figure standing on the rooftop of a nearby building, 
looking into the window of Ranma&#39;s room. She seemed to have earrings, 
which were star-shaped and glowed a dark shade of purple. it was that 
same evil presence, that presence that had been watching for so long 
now. She saw everything; the girl&#39;s ambush of their fiencee, their 
making love, and now she could see what Shampoo was about to do. She 
seemed to smile wickedly at this. 

&quot;(Excellent. The Majiikijutu. You are fulfilling all my hopes Xian. Now 
the Trinity of Love will be complete. Finally, those girls can be 
mine.)&quot; 

=================================================== 

As Shampoo slid her hand down, the most primal of her instincts began to 
kick in. She could feel their heart pounding of each other, like a pair 
of powerful jack-hammers, trying their best to reach one another. Both 
their bodies took on a life of their own. Shampoo&#39;s skin goose pimpled 
more than it ever had before, and her nipples were their hardest, so 
sensitive now, that even a gentle breeze would set them on fire with 
intense sensations. Down below, their was a similar story. Her vulva was 
boiling hot and full of blood, and all of her sexual sensors had lit up 
like a Christmas tree. Having Ranma&#39;s equally aroused womanhood pressed 
against her&#39;s was enough to make her go wild inside. 

Shampoo couldn&#39;t believe it could get any better than this, but it 
would. Driven by a force greater than her own control, her hand 
continued down at a steadily pace, regardless of how hot under the 
collar the young Amazon got. By the time it reached their navels, both 
of them were starting to feel little explosions of pleasure ripple 
throughout their bodies. Ranma was too exhausted to react too much, 
Shampoo however replied with gagged moans while she kissed her airen. 
Her body squirmed as the feelings became more intense. 

And then it happened. It welled up like a massive tsunami, a sensation 
like no other It caused tsunami-like tremors to ripple throughout their 
bodies, tremors which dwarfed a normal orgasm on it&#39;s own. Now they were 
taking massively deep breaths as their bodies tried their best to cope 
with this super-natural sensation. Shampoo nearly had problems holding 
onto her airen, their skin was dripping with sweat, and was incredibly 
slippy, but Shampoo didn&#39;t mind, like a true Amazon, she loved it when 
things got...Primal. The Chinese girl was in love with the sensation 
alone, and she wanted to scream out her call of love but.... it was too 
powerful, she couldn&#39;t breath enough for that, so the best she could do 
was squeak with pleasure with every breath she made. 

But then....the end came. Shampoo&#39;s hand had made it to her clitoris. 
Shampoo braced herself. She had read of the Majiikijutu&#39;s almost 
biblical power, and was almost afraid of it, but like any brave warrior, 
she faced her fear. Her hands came in contact, and she could feel the 
power in their bodies welling up, getting ready to release itself. It 
built up, stronger, and stronger, and even stronger than that. Shampoo 
couldn&#39;t hold on anymore, and so she tensed her muscles, preparing for a 
release of emotion.....but, then.......nothing happened. 

The sensation dissipated. 

Shampoo relaxed a little, slightly confused. What happened? Did she do 
it right? All this went through her mind as her began to cool down. Now 
she was a little disappointed with herself, this was to be her gift to 
Ranma. She a wore a sad face as she spoke to the beloved. 
&quot;(Ohh...Shampoo sorry Ranma...Shampoo want to give-g--g--gg--&quot; 

The feeling was back again, in force. 

They both trembled now at the feeling of it. It filled every blood 
vessel, every vein, every cell of their young bodies. It was incredible, 
Shampoo felt as if the hand of her Goddess had touched her body, sending 
a powerful electric sensation throughout it. Then a legion of pleasure 
tsunamis assaulted them. Tens, hundreds, thousands of them, there were 
so many that the girls couldn&#39;t count them anymore. And then the end 
finally came. 

It was literally like nothing else, at was almost as if they were dying. 
It was like they had left their bodies had touched, and as they began to 
merge, their bodies exploded with vicious, animal-like, primal emotion, 
the likes of which, the likes of which, they had never dreamt possible. 
They returned to their bodies, just in time for them to release. They 
came like they had never cum before, and with it went all the their 
power and soul. Shampoo was out like a light, and fell onto an already 
unconscious Ranma. 

The girls never moved until morning, they slept where they lay. 

-------------------------------------------------------- 

Back to the present, and the breakfast table. 

&quot;Well....&quot; Asked Genma impatiently. &quot;-what did you *do* to him?&quot; For 
obvious reasons, the girls were reluctant to talk about what had 
happened. That was of coarse, except for the more forward Chinese girl. 
&quot;Shampoo and Airens make hot, sticky, love to Ranma!!!!!&quot; Screamed the 
young Amazon cheerfully. 

Everyone there looked shocked at Shampoo, including her girlfriends. 
&quot;Huh? What? What Shampoo say?&quot; Ukyo dig her face into her hands in 
disbelief. &quot;Oh Shampoo...use a little restraint sugar.&quot; &quot;You knew about 
this didn&#39;t you Kasumi?&quot; Asked her father in an unusually all-knowing 
voice. &quot;Oh my, well, they didn&#39;t stay that quiet about it. I could hear 
them from my room.&quot; Chirped the eldest Tendo daughter. 

The girlfriends all burned bright red now, causing Shampoo to drop Ranma 
on the table, his half-unconscious face now in the salad bowl. This new 
realisation from Kasumi appeared to peak Nabiki&#39;s interest for some 
reason. &quot;Y..you mean those noises last night were....were you three 
having sex with each other? (Hmm..better check last night&#39;s audio 
tapes!)&quot; 

Soun now wore a very serious face as he tried to think about this. 
&quot;Akane....is all of this true?&quot; The Tendo girl was a little nervous now. 
&quot;Y..yes father, all of it. We made love last night. All of us... 
...together. I&#39;m...I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;ve overstepped my bounds here, but 
..I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m now a slave to my love for my girlfriends and Ranma.&quot; 
Her father breathed a long, reflective sigh, before looking over at 
Genma, who was moving over to his son. The Panda-cursed man picked his 
son up and examined his face. Ranma wore a really stupid, wide grin on 
his face, and his eyes kept rolling around, and around. He was in some 
kind of happy daze. &quot;You girls made love to him? Together?&quot; Genma asked 
cryptically. &quot;Well-&quot; Replied Ukyo, still embarrassed about this. &quot;-we 
did take turns.&quot; 

&quot;Then how the hell did *this* happen?&quot; Demanded Genma, showing the girls 
his son&#39;s weird looking grin. &quot;Emm...Shampoo can answer. Emmm....Shampoo 
is really sorry. Shampoo used legendary love-making technique called 
Majikijutu on Ranma. Effects can sometimes cause airen to be all weird 
for a while.&quot; Said the Amazon, digging her heel into the ground shyly. 
&quot;What is this &#39;Magikijutee&#39;? Some kind of erotic lure Amazon use to 
catch men?&quot; &quot;No. It not for men. It designed especially for women in 
love!&quot; Replied Shampoo in a perky tone of voice. 

Genma was shocked. &quot;You...you girls forced him to have lesbian sex with 
you?!!!&quot; Ukyo replied. &quot;No. We didn&#39;t force him. He seemed to like it, I 
know *we* did!&quot; As Ukyo finished her sentence, Ranma started to come 
around, and Genma could feel this as he held him. &quot;Ranma....you all back 
together?&quot; Asked his father. Ranma slightly nodded, confirming that, he 
still couldn&#39;t speak much. &quot;Ranma, is this all true? You want to marry 
all the girls?&quot; He nodded again. &quot;....al...all....true.&quot; He said as 
clearly as he could. Seconds later Ranma was gently stolen from Genma&#39;s 
arms by a very pleased Shampoo. &quot;Aww...Shampoo look after little Ranma 
now. Genma not worry, Shampoo take very good care of son!&quot; The Chinese 
girl brought her airen back over to the girls. With a confused 
expression in his face, Genma looked back towards his old friend, to see 
what he thought about this. Soun signalled him over. 

&quot;(What do you think Soun?)&quot; &quot;(I don&#39;t know. My Akane, a lesbian? Think 
of the shame.)&quot; &quot;(True, if people learn that Ranma is changed into a 
girl to have sex....who would ever take me seriously?)&quot; Both fathers had 
to think about this. &quot;(On a plus side....I would finally marry off Akane 
to Ranma, our families would be one, but the other two girls too? I 
don&#39;t know...)&quot; &quot;(Well....do you really think they would say yes without 
Ukyo and Shampoo. Plus, having three brides would make Ranma a true man 
among men. I sure as hell could never manage *3* girls!! Now I&#39;m kinda 
glad that I gave Ranma the room for himself for a few nights.)&quot; They 
made a decision and nodded in agreement as Genma sat beside Soun. 

&quot;Akane, Ukyo, Shampoo and Ranma!&quot; All three girls stood at attention, 
upon hearing Soun, facing the fathers, and Ranma tried his best to 
listen in. &quot;Are you truly serious about this marriage?&quot; Asked Soun. They 
nodded, smiling. &quot;Good....now....how do you propose to pull off a 
three-way marriage? We want a fully legal, Shinto wedding here!&quot; Added 
Genma. Ukyo spoke up. &quot;Saotome-san. It&#39;s legal if each of our marriages 
are counted as separate ones to Ranma. Ranma can have as many wives as 
he wants, it&#39;s a &#39;secret&#39; loop-hole in the law. And as for the Shinto 
side of things... I think they can allow it. As far as I know, monogamy 
is a Christian ideal.&quot; Both fathers were taken back by how much Ukyo 
know about this. &quot;It...it looks like you&#39;ve put a lot of thought into 
this Ukyo.&quot; Stated Soun This pleased the young chef. &quot;Hee! Hee! Thank 
you Tendo-sama!&quot; Soun and Genma then conferred. Another agreement then 
followed. 

Genma spoke first. &quot;Ok, we&#39;re happy. We&#39;ll give you our blessing.&quot; All 
the girl&#39;s widened and sparkled with excitement and they were about to 
sing the men&#39;s praises, but Soun stopped them. &quot;Don&#39;t celebrate yet 
girls. This is a lot more complicated than a normal wedding, first 
you&#39;ve got to find a Temple Priest who is willing to do this, not an 
easy task since most are ancient and very conservative. Then you must 
realise that this will be far larger than most weddings, we can&#39;t help 
you with all of it, you must do the rest of the work yourselves!&quot; They 
nodded in understanding. &quot;Then we support you to marry.&quot; Finished Soun. 

That was a cue for an outburst of emotion. The girls were so overjoyed 
that they had a group hug right there, with Ranma stuck in the middle. 
Akane then broke free and leapt over to her father, wrapping her arms 
around him when she landed, hugging him tightly. &quot;Oh thank you 
Father....&quot; She said, her eyes now full of tears. 
&quot;....I&#39;m...so...happy.&quot; Kasumi had been watching all of this, silently 
pleased as always, but when it finally sank in she spoke. &quot;Oh my, this 
is such a happy scene!&quot; She then turned around and went to one of the 
cupards. &quot;I finally get to make a wedding cake-&quot; She then takes a 
plastic bride and groom from the cupard and examines it closely. 
&quot;-Hmmm...but it looks like I need to make two extra brides. Oh well...&quot; 
She said to herself cheerfully, softly giggling afterward. 

This jubilant scene kept everyone captivated, that is, except Nabiki. 
She had taken note of everything, everything said, everything done, 
everything implied, and as they celebrated, she slithered out of the 
room with a sly smile on her face. Although surprised by all this, the 
middle Tendo took this in her stride, she was after all open-minded, she 
had to be if she wanted to succeed in business. Right now, her 
open-mindedness had given her a profitable idea and so she made her way 
to Furinkan High, and business. 

========================================= 

About an hour or so later, it was nearly time for school to start. 

The girls had decided that they had missed enough school for now, and 
since Ranma was clearly in good health once he had his breakfast, he was 
forced to join them as they went to school. Shampoo had gone home to 
grab a cat-nap before she started her day&#39;s work. 

And so Ranma, Akane, and Ukyo walked together towards Furinkan High. 
Ranma was a little nervous as they walked, this was because he had an 
arm wrapped around each of his as the girls walked on either side of him 
as they talked. 

&quot;...you gotta love the way Shampoo reacted to the way you touched her 
Ukyo!&quot; Said Akane to her girlfriend as part of a conversation they had 
been having. &quot;Yea I know sugar....those Amazon tricks are so powerful, I 
had no idea you can do that with just little touches to the skin!&quot; It 
was then that Ukyo noticed Ranma&#39;s nervous face and commented. &quot;Ranchan? 
You nervous sugar?&quot; &quot;N..no..it&#39;s just.....well.....this is weird.&quot; Ukyo 
looked to the ground with a smile on her face. &quot;Yea..I know what you 
mean....we&#39;re finally a couple...&quot; She then remembered Akane and quickly 
corrected herself. &quot;Opps! I mean threesome! Sorry Akane, sugar! Oh 
wait...and Shampoo. What the hell are we? Ah doesn&#39;t matter, you know 
what I mean.&quot; 

This just confused Ranma. &quot;Wow, this is confusing! Just what I need 
before a more confusing English class!&quot; He spouted sarcastically, 
seconds before Ukyo stopped him in his tracks. &quot;Wait Ranchan...before we 
go into school there&#39;s something we have to tell you.&quot; Said the Chef, 
now with a serious tone of voice. &quot;Ranchan, we&#39;ve got to keep all of 
this quiet. A big lesbian marriage would be a big deal, even in a 
western country. Just imagine what would happen if people *here* found 
out about Akane, Shampoo and myself.&quot; Ranma stood back to think. 

&quot;Ranma.....please....will you keep our secret?&quot; Pleaded Akane softly, 
clasping her hands together. He let out a long sigh before answering. 
&quot;Sure....alright then, I&#39;ll keep the whole wedding a secret...just let 
me know when you what to bring it out.&quot; This pleased both girls, 
especially Ukyo. &quot;Thank you sugar!-&quot; She said with a kiss to his cheek. 
&quot;-now...once more, onto breech with us!&quot; 

They marched down the street and to the entrance of the high school. In 
the main yard were the many crowds of students as usual, chattering away 
before their classes. But then....the trio had arrived at the gates..... 
...and much to the horror of the Chef and Tendo girl, and to the shock 
of Ranma.....every....single....pair of eyes looked directly at them. It 
was silent, the talk had stopped, as the everyone became motionless 
statues who looked at the arriving students standing there, also 
motionless. And then Ukyo realised something.... 

They knew.... 

The trio couldn&#39;t just stand there forever, their first class would 
begin soon. It took a lot of effort and courage, but they made a few 
steps forward and then began to slowly walk through the yard. The other 
students remained motionless still, watching them make their way through 
the yard, most were silent, some whispered to each other, their voices 
echoing around the yard....it was *that* quiet. 

Akane was terrified, and Ukyo could sense it, so she did the only thing 
she could think of to make her better, she took hold of her hand and 
held it tightly. This prompted a silent gasp from the students. In her 
attempt to make things better for Akane, Ukyo had just made it worse. 
But it was nearly over, they had reached the building. The corridors 
were more or less empty, and when they had changed into their school 
shoes, they made their way to class. 

Worse awaited them there. The entire class was already in there, waiting 
for them. The trio entered, one after another, slowly when they saw the 
many eyes looking at them. They inched their way to their seats and then 
carefully sat down. It was tense, and silent.....until eventually one of 
their female classmates plucked up enough courage to speak. &quot;Well? It is 
true?&quot; She asked with wide eyed optimism as everyone closed-in around 
them. &quot;Emm...is what true?&quot; Replied Ukyo with nervously with a question. 
&quot;Is it true...that you....and Ranma....and Akane.....and the Chinese 
girl..... are all going to get....married together?&quot; Asked another girl 
excitedly. 

&quot;Wh...what makes you think that?&quot; Asked Ukyo, now *very* on edge. 
&quot;Nabiki&#39;s been selling that news all morning long. She also has an audio 
tape that sounds like the 4 of you having sex. She&#39;s selling copies for 
2000 Yen.&quot; Replied one of their male classmates. 

Akane secretly formed an angry fist under her desk. &quot;(Damn you Nabiki! 
I&#39;ll get you for this!)&quot; She angrily whispered. Ukyo was lost, 
personally she hadn&#39;t a problem with letting this information out, but 
she wasn&#39;t sure that Akane was ready yet. So she looked over to her 
girlfriend, both looking at each other with worried eyes before Ukyo 
spoke again. &quot;No....there is no truth to what Nab-&quot; &quot;Wait!-&quot; Butted in 
Akane. &quot;-It&#39;s true, I&#39;m marring Ranma, Ukyo and Shampoo. All three of 
them!&quot; She splurted this out nervously, without even thinking about it, 
she felt she had little choice, but to tell them. 

It took a few seconds to sink in, before a wave of excitement engulfed 
the class. The trio now found themselves surrounded by most of the girls 
in the class. &quot;No way! Are....are you two in love?&quot; Asked one girls. 
This question embarrassed the chef and Tendo girl, but they spoke 
anyway. &quot;Yea....Akane and I are an item...we&#39;re girlfriends, and it&#39;s 
the same with Shampoo.&quot; Said Ukyo, now blushing. 

&quot;Wow! What&#39;s it like?&quot; &quot;Yea, what &#39;s like?&quot; &quot;Please tell us!&quot; &quot;Yea, go 
on!!!&quot; &quot;Please Ukyo, we want to know!&quot; &quot;Pleeeeeeeease!&quot; 

Ukyo was perplexed by the questions she was being bombarded with. &quot;What 
is *what* like?&quot; Their female classmates all blushed and looked at each 
other before answering all at once. 

&quot;...BEING WITH A GIRL!!!!!!&quot; 

Akane&#39;s face was boiling with embarrassment, and Ukyo wasn&#39;t too far 
behind as she tried to sum up some words to describe what it was like 
for them. 

&quot;Well....it&#39;s more tender and gentle I suppose.&quot; Ukyo then reaches out 
her and gently grasps Akane&#39;s prompting a smile to grow on her face as 
they both looked into each other&#39;s eyes. &quot;-being with Akane, has shown 
me what true love is.&quot; The girls were fascinated, and while they doated 
over the lesbian couple, Ranma found himself being pulled away from the 
female crowd by the male members of the class. He was thrown into a 
corner and surrounded by them. 

Ranma let out a bemused sigh before speaking. &quot;Let me guess, you want to 
*try* and beat me up for being with Ukyo as well as Akane.&quot; He was 
expecting an agreement, but what came was a surprise. &quot;No we don&#39;t want 
that...&quot; Said one of his classmates. 

&quot;Huh?&quot; Ranma was confused, again. &quot;Ranma, we you teach us? We want to 
know how you pulled it off!&quot; &quot;Pulled what off?&quot; Asked Ranma. &quot;How did 
you get all your girlfriends to get together?!&quot; 

&quot;Yea, how did you do it?&quot; &quot;How do I get *my* girlfriend to hook up with 
another girl?&quot; &quot;What&#39;s your secret?&quot; &quot;Is it some kind of cologne? Love 
potion?&quot; &quot;Come on! What is it?!&quot; 

&quot;Hey! I don&#39;t know! It all just happened! (Story of my life!)&quot; Replied 
Ranma, desperately trying to explain. 

Just then Hinako arrives in the room and notices the large crowd of 
girls near the top of the class, and then approaches it. &quot;What&#39;s going 
on here Kimiko?&quot; Quizzed the English teacher. One of the girls hears her 
name and turns around to address her. &quot;Sensei! It&#39;s Ukyo, Akane, and 
Ranma. They&#39;re getting married!!&quot; &quot;What? *All* three of them?&quot; Asked 
Hinako jokingly. &quot;Yes sensei, all three!! Hee! Hee! Isn&#39;t that 
amazing?!&quot; &quot;What the? Excuse me...&quot; Hinako finds her way to the centre 
of the crowd where Akane and Ukyo were sitting, hand-in-hand. 

&quot;Girls....is this true, you&#39;re getting married to each other?&quot; &quot;Yes...it 
is true, ourselves and Shampoo are getting married with Ranma.&quot; Replied 
Ukyo happily, now she was pleased at the warm response that class had 
given them. &quot;Is that even legal?&quot; &quot;Yep, it&#39;s a long story, but it is.&quot; 

Just then Kimiko butts in. &quot;Ukyo! Ukyo! I&#39;ve been 
having...emmm....dreams with girls in them...emmm-&quot; Kimiko starts to 
blush. &quot;-they kiss me, and play with me...does that mean I&#39;m a lesbian?&quot; 
She asked nervously. Ukyo smiled some more before replying softly. &quot;I&#39;m 
no expert Kimiko, but just because you have lesbian dreams, doesn&#39;t 
necessarily make you one. You may just crave tenderness from your 
lover.&quot; Kimiko was pleased with her reply. &quot;Thank you Ukyo!&quot; 

&quot;Huh...and there was *me* thinking that I was a good teacher Ukyo. You 
should run a class!&quot; Commented Hinako jokingly. &quot;I&#39;m glad that you three 
have gotten together, maybe now I&#39;ll get some work out of you! (Maybe 
now it&#39;s open marriage season in the Tendo Dojo. Hee! Hee! Soun...)&quot; 

The excited conversations continued throughout the early morning, as the 
news spread throughout the school like a wild-fire. 

Meanwhile, there was a far less jubilant scene in the class-room. In one 
corner was a lonely sight. Yuka and Sayuri were together, and were the 
epitome of sadness itself. Their worst nightmare had been realised, and 
as they looked at each other with eyes that were only just able to hold 
back the tears, they could tell that each of their hearts were broken. 

How could they win Akane now? 

========================================= 

The Cat Cafe. 

Shampoo was excitedly hopping around the kitchen with a huge smile on 
her face as a perplexed Cologne watched her. 
&quot;And...and....then....Ranma.. ....Ranma..say yes....and.....and....Akane 
mate with Ranma....and....and... then Ukyo 
mate.....then....then....Shampoo!!! Hee! Hee! Shampoo also... Hee! hee! 
Shampoo also- Hee! Hee! Hee!&quot; The Chinese girl was too excited to speak 
properly, or in complete sentences. &quot;Shampoo...maybe you should take it 
easy. It&#39;s good that you&#39;ve finally got Ranma to agree to be your Airen, 
but if you don&#39;t calm down you&#39;ll lose control!&quot; 

&quot;But Shampoo can&#39;t help it! Hee! Hee! Hee! HEEEEEEEE!!!!&quot; She screamed 
while hopping up and down on the spot. It was then that the Matriarch 
gabbed hold of her granddaughter&#39;s ankles, preventing her from hopping 
anymore. &quot;Please Shampoo! For your own sake!&quot; Shampoo stops and calms 
down a little while she looks down at her grandmother with a muted face. 
&quot;Oh....ok. Shampoo calm it a little.&quot; She said in a more subtle tone of 
voice. 

&quot;Good. Now...maybe some work will help you cool down. There&#39;s some 
tables that need waiting.&quot; &quot;Well ok...that might work.&quot; Replied her 
granddaughter in a perky tone of voice before getting her notepad and 
walking out to the cafe. She went to one of the tables were a couple 
were sittling and then proceeded to flip open her notebook. &quot;Welcome to 
Cat Cafe, Shampoo take order, yes?&quot; 

&quot;Emm...yea, we&#39;ll have two bowls of Raman.&quot; Came the reply from the 
boyfriend. Shampoo then prompty jotted this down in Chinese Kanji. &quot;Very 
good...that come with beautiful girlfriends and Ranma.&quot; &quot;Huh? What was 
that?&quot; Asked the girlfriend prompting Shampoo to blush bright red when 
she realised what she had said. &quot;Opps. Sorry, Shampoo&#39;s mistake. Raman 
Noodles come with option of rice bowl and lemon-water or Akane and Ukyo 
together with Ranma for many years of blissful marriage...&quot; The couple 
looked at her, dumbfounded, promting the young Amazon to blush again. 

&quot;Oh! Emm....Shampoo meant Raman with dumplings and sexy Airens. 
Airens.... that are...pretty naked and.....nice to...mate with....&quot; Her 
face was now bright red as the couple looked at her in shock. 
&quot;Emm...excuse Shampoo... please....&quot; She quickly scurried away into the 
kitchen. When Cologne saw the increadibly emmbarresed face of her 
granddaughter she knew something was up. &quot;Ok Shampoo, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; 

&quot;Shampoo broken.&quot; Came a frank, almost muted, response from an 
emmbarresed Shampoo. &quot;You&#39;re broken? How?&quot; Quizzed the Matriarch as she 
encouraged Shampoo to kneel down. Shampoo does this and then Cologne 
puts her hand on her grandaughter&#39;s brow as if to check for fever. 
&quot;Shampoo&#39;s head is full of Airen&#39;s! Shampoo can&#39;t think straight. 
Shampoo broken...&quot; Upon hearing this and what she felt in her 
granddaughter, Cologne was sure of what was wrong. She let out a long 
bemused sigh before speaking. &quot;Just what I was afraid of...you have Love 
Sickness.&quot; Shampoo promptly stood up with starry eyes in her face. 
&quot;Love...Sickness....&quot; The Chinese Girl then gasped with joyfull 
surprise. &quot;-Shampoo *never* have that before! Yay! Hee! Hee!&quot; 

The fact that she had this &#39;illness&#39; seemed to please the young Amazon 
as she clasped her hands together in joy. Cologne wasn&#39;t really that 
surprised at her response concidering her state of mind. &quot;Well it is a 
sickness Shampoo. It happens when an Amazon has Airens and overdoes it 
with them at the beggining. You&#39;ll be loopy of a few hours now....serves 
you right for using the Majiikijutu. It wasn&#39;t meant for girls as young 
as you are. Now...go and try and sleep this off.&quot; Shampoo now began to 
fidgit at the suggestion of this. &quot;But....but...Shampoo too excited to 
sleep!!&quot; She moaned with a touch of excited frustration. 

&quot;Well if you can&#39;t sleep, go to your Coomicoomi and mate with yourself, 
it&#39;s said to be the best way to cure Love Sickness.&quot; This appeared to 
appease the young Amazon who son calmed down to speak. &quot;Mmm...Shampoo 
mate with self....might do that. But....Shampoo should be working....&quot; 
Said Shampoo in a more sober tone. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about that, just get 
better. I&#39;ll get Mousse to do your work. Go on. Go. Up to your 
Coomicoomi.&quot; The matriach then proceeded to gently herd her 
granddaughter to the stairwell. &quot;Ok, Shampoo going already! See you 
later!&quot; She then skips up the stairs, and out of sight. 

&quot;Mousse! Mousse come here!&quot; The young, visually impared, Amazon man 
shorty appeared following his matriarch&#39;s summons. &quot;Yes, what is it?&quot; 
&quot;Would you do Shampoo&#39;s waiting duties for a while, Shampoo isn&#39;t 
feeling too well.&quot; He suspiciously raised an eyebrow. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with 
her?&quot; Cologne let out a long refelctive sigh before continuing. 
&quot;Ohh...Shampoo&#39;s Love Sick. She&#39;ll be no use to me for a few hours.&quot; 
Mousse was then *very* on edge. &quot;She&#39;s &#39;Love Sick&#39;? But that only 
happens when..&quot; Cologne nods her head, confirming his fears. 

&quot;Shampoo has completed her Airen Promises. She&#39;ll be getting married 
soon..&quot; Mousse recoiled in horror, his worst nightmare had become 
reality, while the matriarch continued. &quot;-Yes..she&#39;ll be married. Of 
course, that&#39;s if you can even call a Japanese wedding a proper 
marriage. It&#39;s just an over-hyped tea-party! I must make sure that 
Shampoo has a proper Amazon joining afterward. Now *that&#39;s* a real 
marrage cerimony. Anyway, you&#39;ve got work to do, get to it.&quot; The 
matriach walks off leaving a distraut Mousse standing there. 

The very reason he came to Japan, the very reason he learned Japanese, 
it was all gone now. What was he now? Why was he here? It was all for 
Shampoo, and now.....she was gone. His life may as well of ended now. 
His soul...had already left him. 

===================================== 

A few hours later... 

Mousse sits alone on his bed. The lights are off, it is dark and only a 
small trickle of light enters his room from the now failing daylight. 
The gloom matched his mood, as he stared longingly at a picture of his 
beloved Amazon bride-to-never-be. Shampoo was now promised to his rival 
for her heart and two other girls to boot. Now he felt defeated, even 
though his normal reaction here would be to hunt Ranma down and blame it 
all on him. But not now, not after what he had heard. Shampoo had 
completed her Airen Promises. He knew, this was an Amazon rite of 
passage, he knew what it meant. 

Amazon are passionate about their marrages, and their religion forbids 
them from ever breaking a completed Airen Promise, for fear of making 
their Goddess cry, a Goddess which they had been thought from birth to 
love with all their heart. With this knowledge, Mousse knew that Shampoo 
would never leave her Airens for him now. He dig his face into his hands 
in dispair. Thoughts of leaving now filled his mind. Thoughts of going 
home, thoughts of resuming his life before he came to Japan, but then 
his thoughts became more....extreme. 

Now he told himself that his life had all been for Shampoo, everything 
he did was for her....for her to love him, to make him her Airen. But 
all that was gone now, and also...as far as he was concerned...his 
reason for living. Tears filled his eyes as he thought of the Amazon 
Suicied Ritual, it was the only way. At least now he would be with a 
woman he loved, his Goddess, Amiono. &quot;(Yes..)&quot; He said with a quivering 
voice. &quot;(...I&#39;ll come back to you now Amiono. This must be what you 
want, you are the reason Shampoo doesn&#39;t love me, you must want me back 
by your busom...)&quot; 

&quot;You don&#39;t have to do that Mu-sze..&quot; Said a woman&#39;s voice from the 
darkness. Mousse was taken by surprise and took a defensive stance when 
he noticed the shadow of a woman standing in the corner of his room. As 
he looked at her two small purple stars began to shine near her ears, 
where earrings would be. &quot;...you have so much to live for, my young 
Amazon Warrior.&quot; Mousse was still on edge, and a little confused. &quot;Who 
are you?!&quot; He demanded nervously. &quot;-are...are *you* Amiono?&quot; The shadowy 
woman appeared to be amused by this. &quot;No Mu-sze. I am not the Goddess. 
But I do have...power.&quot; The sinister way she finished that sentence 
continued to put him on edge. &quot;Who *are* you?&quot; &quot;Someone who 
cares.....You are an Amazon male, a very, very rare thing and very 
precious to the Amazon. No doubt your tribe treated you with the utmost 
care when you were back home...&quot; 

Mousse looked down to the ground, he was now more relaxed with this 
strange woman that he couldn&#39;t even see. &quot;Not all of them....&quot; He said 
with a low tone of voice. &quot;Xian...or Shampoo is the name? Isn&#39;t it? She 
will be Matriarch when the time comes...she should be mating with a 
pure-blood Amazon like you...not with these tainted Devil-Islanders. I 
can help you Mu-sze.&quot; Mousse looked at her, unsure what to think. &quot;How? 
How can you help me?&quot; 

&quot;I can give her to you.....Mu-sze....I can make her love you....&quot; He 
couldn&#39;t believe what he was hearing. &quot;But...how could you possibly do 
*that*? She is commited to those girls and Ranma. And now....she sealed 
the Promise. How could you break that?&quot; A response soon followed, which 
was determined and direct. &quot;I have the power to reach right into 
people&#39;s ghosts, power which I can use to bring her love for you to the 
surface. She does love you Mu-sze, but right now it is only the love of 
a friend.....I can make it more.&quot; Mousse still couldn&#39;t believe it. &quot;I 
can&#39;t believe you have that kind of power. Only the Goddess can do 
that!&quot; &quot;Oh really? Then let me tell you this. I know all about your 
ghost...you are cursed with a Jusekno Ghost. A ghost of a duck, and all 
you know about it is it&#39;s name....Hinalata.&quot; Mousse was shocked. 
&quot;H...how do you know that? I&#39;ve never told anyone that!&quot; 

&quot;I know all.....and I can affect it too. I cannot remove your curse, but 
I can give you Shampoo...are you willing to have her?&quot; He was now 
convinced, this woman knew what she was doing, and she could probably 
help him win Shampoo. &quot;Ok...I believe you. What do I need to do?&quot; A 
sinister smile could now been forming on the woman&#39;s face. &quot;Just help 
me....then she will be yours....&quot; 

================================================================ 

Some time later.... 

Yuka was in her bedroom with Sayuri. They both lay on the bed naked, 
sobbing while they held each other. The room is only lit by many small 
candles floating in bowls of water. A soothing glow filled the room, 
they did this every time they wanted to relax together, everytime they 
wanted to make love. The room reflected their state of mind. This was 
their love-nest, with posters of women together, covering the walls, and 
at Yuka&#39;s dressing table, there was a shrine, to Akane. 

Pictures of the Tendo girl were all over the table which was decorated 
with fresh flowers. And with the pictures were drawings, drawings of 
Akane, most of them with her naked. The girls were never that good a 
drawing, but for Akane, they churned out masterpieces. The drawings of 
the Tendo girl&#39;s face....were near perfect. The girls religously loved 
her, their shrine was better than any temple&#39;s. This just added to blow 
they recieved, when they heard the news of the impending marriage. 

The girls knew that she was a virgin not too long ago, and they had 
fantasied of winning Akane&#39;s heart and sacficing her virginity on their 
beautiful alter. But that wasn&#39;t going to happen, it would never happen, 
and this ripped them up inside. The couple thought that if they made 
love to each other, it would make them feel better. But it didn&#39;t. They 
just cried somemore, bitterly, all because Akane wasn&#39;t there with them. 
They had fallen head-over-heels in love with the Tendo girl, and now 
they were devistated that she had be besomothed to three others. 

&quot;Sa....Sayuri....I...I really-&quot; Sobbed Yuka before her girlfriend butted 
in. &quot;I know, I love...her..too....and I want her with us.&quot; They hugged 
tighty as they sobbed even harder. 

&quot;Awww, don&#39;t cry girls.&quot; Came the voice of a woman from the darkness. 

Both girls jumped upon hearing this voice. They sat up quickly, covering 
their privates as best they could with their hands. 

&quot;No need to cover up. We are all girls here after all.&quot; Added the 
sinister voice. They both kept there nipples and groin well hidden, even 
as Yuka stood up in defence of her girlfriend. &quot;You can do what ever you 
like to me, but you *don&#39;t* touch Sayuri.&quot; Although frightened, Sayuri 
was touched by her girlfriend&#39;s brave stand. 

&quot;Aww...how touching. Defending your girlfriend like that....don&#39;t worry. 
If I had wanted to rape you, you would not of had any warning of my 
presence.&quot; The girls still didn&#39;t trust her. &quot;What do you want?&quot; 
Demanded Yuka. &quot;I want to help you girls...&quot; Said the woman softly as 
her star-shaped earrings began to glow with purple light. 

&quot;Help us? How?&quot; Asked Sayuri, now confused. &quot;I can give her to you..... 
I can give you Akane....It is only right....you have been friends for so 
long. Both of you have found love with each other. She loves you too, 
and she also prefers mating with girls. You belong together.&quot; 

The girlfriends felt a little more relaxed now, and were willing to hear 
what this woman had to say. &quot;We love her....we&#39;ve always loved her...&quot; 
Said Yuka meekly with touch of emotion. &quot;We wanted to spend our lives 
together with her but now....now she&#39;s got two other girlfriends and 
Ranma. They&#39;re going to get married-&quot; Added Sayuri with sadness in her 
voice. 

&quot;It shouldn&#39;t happen...&quot; Said the woman with force, surprising the 
girlfriends. &quot;She belongs with you, and I can help you...&quot; 

The girls look at each other, talking to one another with their eyes, 
wondering what to make of this. &quot;Help us? How could you possibly help 
us?&quot; 

A cunning grin now formed on the woman&#39;s face. &quot;I know the ways of the 
heart.. and of the Power of Dreams. I can use her love for you, to make 
her love you back in the same way you love her.&quot; 

This was enough for the girls who suddenly became braver. They stopped 
covering themselves, forgetting they were naked, and took a few steps 
towards the shadowy woman. &quot;You....you would do that for us?&quot; Asked 
Sayuri, not believing her potential luck. 

&quot;Why yes, of course....but I need something in return..&quot; Replied the 
woman, in that sinister voice. 

&quot;Yes! Anything! Anything to get our Akane!!&quot; Splurted Yuka with boiling 
emotion. Right now they were despite, and would do anything, even the 
unthinkable, to win Akane&#39;s heart. 

The woman now grinned menacingly. &quot;Join me....follow my orders.....help 
me complete my task, and then...she will be yours.&quot; 

The girls now looked at each other with starry eyes of excitement. 
Finally, their prayers to the Love Goddess would be answered. &quot;Yes! 
We&#39;ll do it! We&#39;ll help you!&quot; Said the girls excitedly in tandem like a 
pair of twins. 

The woman was pleased by this. &quot;Good.....you will have her very soon 
now.&quot; She said with a low deep voice. The pleasantries were now gone, 
she spoke seriously now...this was business. 

&quot;But-&quot; Added Yuka nervously. &quot;-we don&#39;t even know your name...&quot; It was 
then that she moved, out of the darkness, out of the shadows, and into 
what little light their was. And then she could be seen clearly. 

She was a young and very beautiful Japanese woman, in her very early 
twenties, with long flowing black hair. The girls were stunned by her 
beauty as she spoke. 

&quot;My name? Why......just call me.......Ryu.&quot; 

======================================================================== 

Later that evening, a sense of celebration filled the Tendo Dojo. A 
feast was being held in honour of the now impending marriage. 

The three girls were there as well as the rest of the Dojo&#39;s household 
and they were now winding down, relaxing after their meal. &quot;Nhuuuh! That 
was great Kasumi, thank you.&quot; Said Ukyo as she stretched her arms out in 
satisfaction as the eldest Tendo daughter began to clean up. &quot;Don&#39;t 
mention it Ukyo-&quot; Said Kasumi with her usual smile and pleasant 
demeaner. &quot;-it&#39;s nothing really.&quot; 

&quot;Well the least I can do is help you-&quot; Said the Chef as she was about to 
rise to her feet only to be gently stopped by the eldest Tendo girl&#39;s 
hand pressing on her shoulder. &quot;Not at all Ukyo, this is your party. 
What kind of host would I be if I let you do any of the work?&quot; Said 
Kasumi always with that smile on her face and in her eyes. Ukyo just 
watched dumbfounded as Kasumi carried a huge pile of dishes off to the 
kitchen and out of sight. 

&quot;Where does she get the energy?&quot; Commented Ukyo, still dumbfounded. &quot;I 
dunno Ukyo, I supposed she&#39;s just full of spirit.&quot; Replied Akane while 
sipping her drink. How right she was. For as Shampoo watched Kasumi 
disappear out of the room, she sensed something. Ever since she learned 
the Ghost Weapon, the young Amazon had gained a sort of ESP. Now she 
could feel more paranormal senses. Now she could feel the many unliving 
souls of Nerima, and right now in the Tendo Dojo she could feel 
something. Someone.....a woman. Centred around....Kasumi...but it felt 
like Kasumi. Shampoo didn&#39;t know what to make of this, and so she said 
nothing. 

Ukyo suddenly lets out a beleaguered sigh, signally the discontent that 
now surfaced within her. &quot;Hey, what&#39;s wrong Ukyo?&quot; Asked Akane softly, 
now a little concerned for her girlfriend. The chef was taken off guard 
by Akane&#39;s question, not expecting anyone to have heard her. &quot;Huh? Oh, 
Akane....Well....it&#39;s just-&quot; Ukyo breaths another soft sigh before 
continuing. &quot;-with the marriage, and our relationship, and school ....I 
have very little time left for my restaurant......I&#39;m going to have to 
try and get an extra hand. But who?&quot; 

This instantly caught Nabiki&#39;s attention who now raised an eyebrow 
before she spoke from the other side of her drink. &quot;You need people?&quot; 
She said with a coy smile on her face. 

&quot;Well yea....you interested?&quot; Asked Ukyo, not sure what to make of this. 

&quot;I...might be....&quot; She replied with a sly glint in her eye, which the 
Chef instantly read as money-lust. 

&quot;I won&#39;t be able to offer you much Nabiki, and it&#39;ll be cash-in-hand...&quot; 
This prompted Nabiki to look a little disappointed, before she realised 
that it didn&#39;t matter too much, the Tendo girl wanted to work. 

&quot;Well...that would be Ok with me....if you would have me....&quot; 

&quot;Emmm....alright....sure. It&#39;ll save me the time and expense of finding 
someone else. It&#39;s cool with me, but only if your father agrees.&quot; 

Both Ukyo and Nabiki look in the direction of Soun, who had heard all of 
this. 

&quot;Well....ok then, Ucchan&#39;s will, after all, be a family business when 
Ukyo marries in.&quot; Said the head of the household, prompting Nabs to 
smirk with genuine pleasure. 

Although she was still a little unsure what to make of this, Ukyo 
appeared to be very pleased to have found a new employee so easily, with 
the added convenience of that person being her girlfriend&#39;s sister. 
&quot;Well...that&#39;s great then! Do you mind starting tomorrow?&quot; Nabiki gave 
an approving nod from her accounting throne, where she believed she was 
doing the Chef a massive favour by working for her. &quot;Good, then if you 
don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like you to come Ucchan&#39;s with me in a while, so I can 
train you in.&quot; 

Nabiki agreed to this and when both were satisfied, Akane began to 
whisper in Ukyo&#39;s ear. &quot;(Are you really sure you want Nabiki working for 
you?)&quot; This attitude was not unexpected considering what Nabs had done 
to them that morning. &quot;(I think it&#39;ll be ok Akane. She did apologise for 
what she did today, and besides, she&#39;s good with money.) Anyway...&quot; Said 
the Chef out-load while she scanned the room with her eyes. &quot;...where is 
Ranchan? I don&#39;t see him anywhere...&quot; Akane was quick to answer. 

&quot;Huh? Oh yea. Ranma went outside, said he needed some air....&quot; 

================================================== 

Ranma stood outside the house, by the Koi Pond. He stood there, a solemn 
and lonely figure as he stared at the reflection of the Moon on the 
water as little bodies of white and red swam around and inside of it. A 
lot was on his mind, the weight of the world was on his shoulders. He 
had three girls...all equally in love with him...all agreed to marry 
him...all, stunningly beautiful....any guy&#39;s dream...or was it? 

Something was terribly wrong, and he knew it. He was so preoccupied by 
this, that he did even notice Ukyo peek her head out the door. Satisfied 
that Ranma hadn&#39;t seen her, a sneaky grin now grew on her face as she 
softly walked over to him, with her arms stretched out, ready to &#39;get 
him&#39;. 

He didn&#39;t see it coming until the second he felt a pair of femine arms 
wrap themselves around his waist as Ukyo hugged tightly, pressing her 
soft and unmistakingly female form against his muscular back. 

&quot;Hi sugar! I&#39;ve been looking for you!&quot; A little dazed and embarrassed by 
the *very* close way that Ukyo held him, Ranma stood rigidly where he 
was. Ukyo was hoping for her male lover to swing around and return her 
affections, and was a little disappointed that Ranma did nothing...... 
but she wasn&#39;t one to give up that easily. 

Instead, while still holding onto Ranma&#39;s waist, *she* swung around him 
to face the guy, so that he could stare into her endless eyes. She tried 
to make herself as cute as possible as she spoke, always smiling with 
wide starry eyes. 

&quot;Hee! Hee! I&#39;ve been looking forward to seeing you again, all day long! 
I couldn&#39;t even concentrate in class.....I just love you too much, I 
just wanted...to do....this-&quot; And with that her instincts kicked in as 
she went on her tippytoes, leaning against Ranma.....and stealing a 
short yet powerful kiss, taking him totally by surprise. She clung on 
with her lips for a few seconds and then letting go as she returned to 
original stance, now with a warm smile on her face. 

&quot;I can&#39;t believe I did that-&quot; Commented the chef, nearly chuckling. 
&quot;-ever since I made love to you...I feel like I can do things like that, 
no problem. It&#39;s strange the way you think differently about a person, 
once you&#39;d &#39;been&#39; with them. Don&#39;t you agree sugar?&quot; 

Just then, Chef noticed something disturbing under Ranma&#39;s apparently 
neutral visage....she could see his pain, and feel it too. She now wore 
a concerned face as looked upon the guy that she loved all these years. 
&quot;Sugar.....are you OK?&quot; 

The proud martial artist shrug it off, he would never admit to being 
injured, not even emotionally. &quot;No Ukyo....I&#39;m fine...really...&quot; Ukyo 
scrutinised his response carefully, as well as his face...she didn&#39;t buy 
it. 

&quot;You can&#39;t lie to me Ranchan, I&#39;ve known you too long....&quot; Ranma still 
stood his ground, refusing to admit what was wrong. &quot;Ranchan please-&quot; 
Ukyo was now getting choked up with emotion. &quot;-I love you! I don&#39;t to 
see you hurt....please....tell me.&quot; The genderly-challanged guy could 
now see that this was upsetting Uyko, and so...he tried to talk. 

&quot;Well you see it&#39;s........&quot; He faced away, too embarrassed to complete 
this sentence for some reason. The chef could see that she was cracking 
the surface, and so she softly encouraged him. &quot;Yes Ranchan? Go on.....&quot; 

He swallowed his pride, and faced back again. &quot;It&#39;s 
just....everything... learning that you three are lesbians......and this 
three-way marriage.... ..and the school and......well.....it&#39;s all going 
so fast....and....I&#39;m...&quot; He couldn&#39;t finish the sentence, but Ukyo 
could read his meaning as she snuggled her head into his chest as she 
hugged him tighter than before. &quot;Yea.....I&#39;m scared too...&quot; Came the 
all-knowing response much to Ranma&#39;s surprise. 

&quot;But you know what Ranchan? My love for you guys gets me through it. It 
was just as daunting for me too....falling in love with Akane....losing 
my virginity....Shampoo....it&#39;s scares me sometimes, &#39;cause I know 
things will never be the same again...&quot; 

This sort of made Ranma feel a little better. Ukyo understood, when he 
thought no-one could, and now, Ukyo could feel that within him. She 
smiled as she looked up at him. &quot;Ranchan....this will never 
change....you and me....I always thought of you as 
my....boyfriend....and well, if you think about it, the only things we 
were missing in our relationship before...was the kissing and sex....&quot; 

She now managed to embarrass them both as they wore bright red blushes 
in their cheeks. 

When Ukyo calmed back down again, she took on an even softer tone of 
voice, she wanted to leave Ranma alone, on a good note. 

She lightly stroked his hair as she spoke. &quot;Aww. Ranchan, sugar, I 
promise that I&#39;ll go slower with you. Give you the chance to adapt that 
we didn&#39;t have...&quot; She then lightly, but lovingly kissed him on the 
cheek. &quot;...myself and the girls are going to sleep over at my place 
tomorrow night. We&#39;re going to &#39;play&#39;, if you know what I- Hee! Hee! 
-mean. But....if you don&#39;t feel up to it, because I don&#39;t want to rush 
you, you don&#39;t have to come.&quot; She whispered this softly into his ear. 

She then softly let go of him, and prepared to walk away, but not before 
speaking one last time. &quot;I&#39;ve gotta go now. Nabiki&#39;s agreed to come work 
for me, so I&#39;ll have to train her tonight. Ranchan....no matter what, I 
love you, always. Hang in there sugar....&quot; She smiled one last time, 
before she strolled towards the house, and out of sight. 

Ranma watched as she left, with one thing on his mind. 

What did he do...to deserve a girl as amazing as her....? 

================================================================= 

Night gripped the streets of Nerima, the only light now came from the 
moth-plagued streetlamps, creating little patches of light and darkness, 
which Ukyo and Nabiki now walked through. 

The air was cool and pleasing to the pair as they strolled along the 
main road between the Dojo and Ucchan&#39;s, the night was calm and silent, 
helping them to cool down after their night. 

Surprisingly they both remained silent as they walked. Nabiki was a 
little uptight about all this. She was walking with her sister&#39;s 
girlfriend, and although she had no problems with lesbians...this was 
kind of weird for her. Ukyo on the other hand, was merely more 
interested in looking at her own breath as it condensed in the cold 
night air. It seemed to amuse her for a while, until she got notice of 
the Tendo girl&#39;s discomfort on her face. 

The chef looked curiously at the middle Tendo before speaking her mind, 
as she always did. 

&quot;Nabiki? What&#39;s wrong? you haven&#39;t said a thing since we left your 
house?&quot; Nabiki was taken by surprised by Ukyo&#39;s softly spoken question 
but she was prepared to answer. 

&quot;Huh? Oh...well...it&#39;s just....you&#39;ll think this is stupid...&quot; Said the 
Tendo girl softly as she looked to the ground, a little embarrassed. 
This only served to make Ukyo even more curious, Nabs never usually 
behaved like this... &quot;No Nabiki..go on...&quot; 

&quot;Well-&quot; Continued the Middle Tendo. &quot;-it&#39;s just a little weird...you 
being my sister&#39;s girlfriend and all....and if you get married, you&#39;ll 
technically be my sister in-law!&quot; This prompted the chef to start 
giggling softly. &quot;Aww. Is that all that&#39;s wrong? Yea it is weird, but 
well...I got used to it, I suppose you will too.&quot; 

This appeased the little capitalist slightly as she now looked up only 
to stop her new boss in her tracks. &quot;But.....what is it like....being 
with a girl? I know people were asking this all day.....but....what&#39;s it 
like? It seems to make Akane so happy...&quot; Ukyo now smirked as she 
encouraged Nabiki to start walking with her again. &quot;Why sugar? You 
interested?&quot; Taunted the chef, playfully. 

&quot;Nooooo....&quot; Spouted the Tendo Girl. &quot;-I prefer guys! I&#39;m just 
curious...that&#39;s all, and besides....sex doesn&#39;t sell these 
days....lesbianism does! I mean look at that Tatu duo!&quot; The chef again 
began to giggle softly as she imagined little Yen kanji floating around 
Nabiki&#39;s head. 

&quot;You know Nabiki, those two aren&#39;t really lesbian, they&#39;re just 
acting..&quot; Replied the chef in a bubbly tone of voice. &quot;Yea! I know! But 
they make MILLIONS!&quot; Spouted the Middle Tendo as the glint of money-lust 
has clearly in her eyes. 

&quot;Nabiki...you really are something else...&quot; Said Ukyo, shaking her head 
with a smile on her face. 

================================================ 

Soon enough they reached the darkened front of Okonomiyaki Ucchan&#39;s, 
where only a small glow emanated from inside. After fumbling with her 
keys the chef unlocks the door and politely saw Nabiki inside. The 
restaurant was only dimly lit by the counter lights as Konatsu was 
sweeping the floor. He was surprised by sudden arrival of girls and 
halted his work as they came in. 

&quot;Hi Konatsu, sugar. Was everything ok while I was gone?&quot; Said Ukyo 
softly as she led Nabiki over to the counter, prompting her to take off 
her jacket. &quot;Yes Ukyo, nothing really happened.&quot; He stated nervously 
before returning to his sweeping. &quot;You&#39;ve met Nabiki, Akane&#39;s sister, 
haven&#39;t you?&quot; Chirped the chef as she moved over to the till. 

&quot;Emm...I&#39;m not sure, I don&#39;t think so...&quot; He stammered while he finished 
his sweeping and put the broom away. &quot;Well then...Nabiki, this is 
Konatsu. Konatsu, Nabs is going to be working here for a while with you. 
Is that ok with you?&quot; He nodded meekly while he returned to where they 
were, a little phased that another girl was there with them. 

&quot;Well...it&#39;s good to know that I&#39;ll be working with another girl!&quot; 
Spouted Nabiki cheerfully, not realising the error that she had made. 
&quot;*Ahem* Nabiki....Konatsu&#39;s a boy...&quot; Ukyo&#39;s comment only served to 
confuse the Tendo girl as she looked over to her, and then at Konatsu 
and then back again. She crossed her arms with a curious face as she 
looked up and down the young ninja&#39;s body, wondering what to make of 
him. 

&quot;A boy huh? Hmm...I&#39;m not convinced, I need *proof*!&quot; Announced Nabs 
with a coy smile on her face, which only served to embarrass Konatsu 
when he realised what kind of &#39;proof&#39; she meant. Ukyo, however, was 
amused by this and decided to join in. 

&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry Nabiki-&quot; Said the Chef in a seductive tone of voice. 
&quot;...He&#39;s a man alright...I can vouch for *that*...&quot; Ukyo then finished 
with a slow seductive wink in Konatsu&#39;s direction, prompting the young 
ninja to grow bright red as he tried to make an excuse to leave. 

&quot;Emm...err..emm..I gotta...gotta go now...bye-&quot; He then ran off bumping 
into several objects on his way out of the room. 

The girls burst into a laughing fit seconds later, the laughter they had 
held in for the past minute was released in a few seconds before they 
calmed down. &quot;Aww...Konatsu sugar, you are really something else!&quot; Said 
the chef in a voice of laughter as she wiped a tear from her eye. 

&quot;..Is....is he like that all the time?&quot; Forced the Tendo girl thought 
her laughter, she didn&#39;t normally burst into laughter like this, but 
this truly was something else to her. &quot;Well...yea kinda, he&#39;s a little 
shy. Also his step-family kinda screwed him up...that&#39;s why he lives 
here with me.&quot; Nabiki ended her laughter upon hearing this, confusing 
news. 

&quot;He lives with you? Do you charge him rent? Isn&#39;t it kinda...weird 
having a guy like him living in your apartment? He could be peeping at 
you when your naked.&quot; Put the Tendo girl in a serious tone. 

&quot;What? You mean like YOU? I&#39;ve heard from Akane, all about the times 
you&#39;ve spied on her in the shower, just to steal a nudie shot of her!&quot; 
Nabiki raised an eyebrow, wondering now what to say thanks to Akane 
grassing her over her &#39;exploitation&#39; photography. 

&quot;Well, that was business. A Naked Picture of Akane would be valuable to 
my buyers. What I mean is...Konatsu would be looking at you for... other 
reasons...&quot; 

A proud smile now filled the chef&#39;s face as she prepared to speak. 
&quot;Nabiki, I can trust Konatsu totally. He has never peeked at me, he has 
never touched me, except when I wanted him to, and he even gave me total 
privacy when I wanted to masturbate. And if you think that&#39;s just the 
behaviour of a nice guy, wait till you hear *this*... ...He&#39;s also in 
LOVE with me!-&quot; Nabiki was shocked. &quot;-he is the single most honourable 
guy (except for Ranma) that I&#39;ve ever come across, so I think it&#39;s just 
fine having him live with me!&quot; 

The Tendo girl tried her best to get her head around this. &quot;So...He 
lives with you....Is in LOVE with you and has never even thought about 
trying to see you in the buff?&quot; Ukyo nodded in confirmation. &quot;That&#39;s 
unbelievable...&quot; 

&quot;Well believe it Nabs...and you&#39;ll get same treatment too. 
Now...business...gotta train you. Come over here, and we&#39;ll get 
started..&quot; The chef proceeds to guide her new trainee over to the till. 
&quot;Do you know how to use one of these Nabs?&quot; Nabiki examined the till for 
a second and smiled before replying. &quot;Yea. It&#39;s a Casio shop till. Our 
Dojo&#39;s lesson till is just like it.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s great! Well then-&quot; Ukyo unlocks a pops open the money drawer. 
&quot;-I trust you know how a Till Float works!&quot; Nabiki smirked at the 
implication that she didn&#39;t know what this basic accounting tool was. 
&quot;Of course!&quot; She said while she sat on her laurels. &quot;Good...I like to 
keep a float of 10000 Yen. So that&#39;s what I want you to do too. I keep 
the 20 Yen coins in this tray, 50&#39;s in there. 100, 200, 500 and you can 
see how I have the notes.&quot; 

Nabiki looks into the till with a glint in her eye. Ukyo sees this and 
promptly shuts and locks the drawer. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Nabs, you&#39;ll get some 
of it too...now....there&#39;s a trick to my pricing.&quot; Nabiki looks at her 
with a curious face. &quot;A trick?&quot; 

&quot;Yep. I include the Sales Tax with the overall price on the menu. I do 
this so the customers don&#39;t have to work it out in their heads. It makes 
sense since everything has 21% Tax on it.&quot; &quot;Hey! That&#39;s cheating! 
Everyone else has to work it out! I have to do it for the Dojo Students! 
So should you!&quot; 

Ukyo smirked as she realised that she had got one over on the Great 
Economist herself. &quot;Nabs...people come here BECAUSE I give them an 
inclusive price. It&#39;s easier for them and us. I don&#39;t know why more 
places don&#39;t do that. This country is really messed up when it comes to 
sales tax!&quot; 

The Tendo girl scratched her head while she thought about this. 
&quot;Wow...you&#39;re right...I can&#39;t believe those business studies classes 
blinded me. But still...you could leave it out, make your menu look 
cheaper than it actually is...&quot; &quot;I&#39;m not that cruel Nabiki...I don&#39;t 
like to lie to my own customers..&quot; 

&quot;...Oh well...then....do I have to cook Ukyo? &#39;Cause I&#39;m only ok at it. 
Can only really do tofu, rice, noodles and the like.&quot; She said with some 
reservation, not wanting this to cost her this job. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Nabiki, I won&#39;t expect you to cook until you&#39;ve got a hang 
of it. Konatsu will take care of it if I&#39;m not here.&quot; This put the Tendo 
girl at ease while she relaxed against the counter. &quot;Hey Ukyo....&quot; 
&quot;Yea?&quot; &quot;Ever worry that something will go wrong with this marriage? 
Something usually does screw stuff up around here fairly regularly.&quot; 
&quot;Hmm....no...&quot; She said with a smile on her face. &quot;-I&#39;ve a feeling that 
everything....will turn out just fine...&quot; 

=================================================================== 

Darkness.....pitch darkness where only a small glow of light existed. 
Some figures approach the glow. 

A girl, with short brunette hair, wearing a tightly fitting ninja&#39;s 
robe, with the head coverings loosely hanging from her neck. It was 
Yuka, who looked committed as she stood at the edge of a circular, 
Amazon-style symbol in the centre of the room, she then looked towards 
the other that came with her. 

Sayuri appeared, just as committed and dressed the same, her hair tied 
up neatly with black string. She met her girlfriend at the symbol, where 
they broke their focus for a second to smile warmly at each other. 

Then another figure appeared, it was Mousse, also dressed in the black 
robes of a ninja. They all stood in a semi-circle around the symbol, 
waiting for something, which came seconds later. 

From the darkness came a woman, bare-foot, draped in a loosely fitting 
robe. It was Ryu, she gracefully moved to the centre of the symbol where 
she stopped and then with one swift movement of her hand, she dropped 
the robe to the ground, revealing her naked body. 

&quot;It is time...to begin.&quot; 

Ryu stood rigidly in the dead centre of the symbol as she crossed her 
arms in an Egyptian style before closing her eyes to concentrate. 
Nothing happened for a few seconds, and the trio were wondering what 
would happen next...but then it came. 

A massive blast of wind-like energy came from ground and lifted Ryu&#39;s 
hair as it coursed through her body. The trio only got the edge of it, 
but nonetheless it felt powerful from where they were. This continued 
for about a minute as Ryu faced up, overcome with the sense of power now 
within her, before facing forward again and easing her eyes open as the 
energy-wind died down, dropping her hair to her shoulders. 

The air in the room now felt static, causing the trio&#39;s hair to stand on 
end for a short while. As well as that they could now feel the energy 
coming from Ryu as she now walked over to a now on-edge Yuka. The nude 
woman stood in front of the girl for a few seconds and met her eyes with 
her own, gazing for a while, almost hypnotising the girl with her 
presence. 

&quot;Yuka...&quot; She said with a powerful voice. &quot;...are you prepared to do 
anything to win Akane&#39;s heart?&quot; &quot;Y...y...yes I am!&quot; Stammered Yuka, a 
little nervous, but confident of her task regardless. She then watched 
as Ryu gently took hold of her left hand, rubbed it between her own for 
a few seconds, and then firmly placed it between the woman&#39;s uncovered 
breasts. Yuka was a little flushed by this, but considering all that had 
happened to far, it wasn&#39;t much. What came next however, did embarrass 
her. 

&quot;Now Yuka, place your other hand....within my womanhood...&quot; 

Yuka&#39;s cheeks now turned a bright shade of crimson. &quot;In....in....inside 
your-&quot; 

&quot;Yes.....Yuka.....please....don&#39;t be shy....&quot; Came the soft yet sinister 
reply. Yuka had to get brave now, this was for Akane after all, and so 
she looked over to Sayuri with eye&#39;s as if to say &#39;I&#39;m sorry&#39;, before 
reaching down with her free hand around the mysterious woman&#39;s groin and 
then slid her fingers into the unexplored depths of her womanhood, 
prompting a sly grin to grow on the woman&#39;s face. Sayuri was touched by 
Yuka&#39;s apparent apology, that she would consider this adultery, even 
though it was an act of love for her, knowing that she wanted Akane just 
as bad. Both girls took strength from each other. 

Ryu now began. &quot;Yuka....repeat after me: Ana kintanato-&quot; &quot;Ana kitanato-&quot; 

&quot;-rine fomikara-&quot; &quot;-rine fomikara-&quot; 

&quot;-hinte hono fola-&quot; &quot;-hinte hono fola-&quot; 

&quot;-Majiikijutu.&quot; &quot;-m...Majiikijutu.&quot; 

The incantation was complete, and before Yuka knew what was happening, a 
massive force invaded her body. Ryu was doing something to her, but all 
she knew was that it was powerful, and so she began to breath heavily, 
trying her best to cope with this. Ryu on the other hand, appeared to be 
getting sexual pleasure from it as she moaned and held her arms out 
behind her rigidly, relaxing into this sensation which Yuka was giving 
to her thanks to her &#39;well-positioned&#39; hand. 

The most powerful part of it came just before the anti-climax, when an 
orange-coloured energy-wind engulfed them both sending their hair 
skyward. Yuka closed her eyes, desperately trying to cope with this 
overwhelming situation, but fortunately it didn&#39;t last long. Soon 
everything was back to normal and their hair had surrendered to gravity 
yet again. 

&quot;You may retract from me now Yuka....If you wish...&quot; Said Ryu with a 
voice full of sinister seduction. Yuka elected to free her hand from 
Ryu, which she did fairly quickly. 

&quot;Pity...&quot; Said woman with sly look on her face, which only served to put 
both Yuka and Sayuri on-edge. &quot;..never mind. Now Yuka, I have granted 
you a great power, a power which will serve you in our great task.&quot; 

After stealing another glimpse of Yuka&#39;s eyes, Ryu then moved towards 
Sayuri who had a question waiting. 

&quot;But...what is our great task Ryu?&quot; 

Ryu stood in front of Sayuri, in the same way that she had with Yuka. 
&quot;All of that will come in it&#39;s *own* time Sayuri...you will do the same 
as Yuka now...&quot; 

Following that, Sayuri placed her hands in the same uncompromising 
position that her girlfriend had been in, before repeating the 
incantation that Yuka had just said. 

&quot;Ana kintanato, rine fomikara, hinte hono fola, Majiikijutu&quot; 

It was the same effect with her...and when that was finished she then 
began to move over to Mousse, who was trying his best to contain a 
nose-bleed after seeing all of this. Plus, this all made him very 
nervous. 

Ryu stood proud in her nudity as she glared at him with a coy smile. 
&quot;It&#39;s your turn now, Mu-sze...&quot; She took his left-hand placed it firmly 
between her breasts. The second his hand settled, Mousse stood rigidly, 
frozen with uncertainty, and embarrassment. Ryu could now see that he 
wouldn&#39;t do the next part on his own. 

&quot;(Come now Mu-sze...)&quot; She whispered into his ear, while gently taking 
hold Mousse&#39;s right hand. &quot;(...I know this isn&#39;t the *first* time a girl 
has made you touch her womanhood.)&quot; Mousse turned bright crimson when he 
replied. &quot;(Y..yea...that&#39;s right.)&quot; 

&quot;(Good....now...let me help you with this...)&quot; Said Ryu with sinister 
seduction as she took the young Amazon&#39;s hand and slowly inserted it 
within her. This was nearly too much for him...the only girl he ever 
wanted to do this with, was Shampoo. 

&quot;Ok Mousse, repeat after me, in our language, the tongue of the Amazon: 
Ana kintanato-&quot; &quot;A..a..ana kitanato-&quot; 

&quot;-rine fomikara-&quot; &quot;-ri..rine fomikara-&quot; 

&quot;-hinte hono fola-&quot; &quot;-hinte hono fola-&quot; 

&quot;-Majiikijutu.&quot; &quot;-mmm...Majiikijutu.&quot; 

---------------------------------------------------------------- 

The Next Morning 

---------------------------------------------------------------- 

It was a cloudy morning in Nerima, with a cool breeze coursing through 
the streets, making it colder than what it would usually be for this 
time of year. 

As usual, Shampoo was out early on her delivery bike, doing her rounds. 
She came to one of the houses on the main street and dismounted. After 
taking hold of one of the bundles on the bike, the young Amazon rapped 
on the front door, which was soon answered. 

&quot;Nihao Mrs. Sato! Shampoo bring raman bundle you order.&quot; Shampoo then 
proceeded to hand it over to her. &quot;Good morning Shampoo, thank you. How 
much is that?&quot; &quot;Emm...700 Yen....plus 147 Yen tax.....that 847 Yen!&quot; The 
Chinese girl is then handed a 1000 Yen note. &quot;Here you are...keep the 
change.&quot; &quot;Oh, thank you very much! See you again soon?&quot; &quot;Oh yes, take 
care of yourself now, bye!&quot; &quot;Bye! Bye!&quot; 

The door was closed and Shampoo proceeded to stuff the note into her 
cleavage where the rest of her delivery money was hidden, before 
checking her notepad. 

&quot;Hmm....that last one for the morning...&quot; A huge grin now invaded her 
face. &quot;Hee! Hee! Time for Uyko!!!&quot; She made a bounding leap from where 
she stood and somersaulted onto her bike, taking care not to injure her 
most sensitive assets when she landed on the saddle. Faster than it took 
for her bike gear to engage, Shampoo was gone like the wind. 

===================================================== 

On the other side of Nerima at Ucchan&#39;s, Ukyo was outside sweeping, 
enjoying a Saturday morning where she didn&#39;t have to go to school. Her 
small piece of tranquillity ended however, with the arrival of Nabiki. 

&quot;Good morning Ukyo.&quot; 

&quot;Ahh, hello Nabiki, good morning. You ready for a hard day&#39;s work?&quot; 

&quot;Ukyo...where I live *everyday* is a hard day&#39;s work!&quot; Said the Tendo 
girl with a smug face on her. Ukyo just giggled a little before 
replying. &quot;Yea, I can believe that. Well...better get inside so we can 
start. I&#39;ll be in as soon as I finish here.&quot; 

Nabiki drifted inside while Ukyo continued to brush the dust and leaves 
away. She enjoyed this menial task, it the most relaxing part of her 
job, and soon she began to relax, but of coarse she knew that this 
fleeting moment of tranquillity wouldn&#39;t last. For seconds later she 
heard the ringing of a small bell and the clatter of an old bike chain, 
prompting the chef to sigh softly into her broom. 

&quot;Here we go again...&quot; Said the chef softly with a small smile on her 
face. Sure enough it was the young Chinese girl, speeding down the 
street of Okonomiyaki Ucchan&#39;s and was watched by Ukyo as she flew right 
up to the restaurant and came to an abrupt stop sending Shampoo&#39;s 
rear-wheel sky-ward before the bicycle finally settled. 

Ukyo stared at the pair of starry Chinese eyes that looked back at her 
with excitement before the Amazon finally began to move. In one swift, 
well practiced move, Shampoo kicked the kick-stand down, leapt into the 
air and landed mere centimetres from her Airen, much to Ukyo&#39;s surprise. 

&quot;HIHAO UKYO! Time for morning kiss!!&quot; She spouted excitedly before 
grabbing Ukyo&#39;s broom throwing it to one side, each move full of passion 
and love for the brunette girl. Before Ukyo even had a chance to react, 
Shampoo wrapped herself around her lover and pinned her to the 
restaurant&#39;s front while kissing her with the typical level of passion 
that Ukyo expected from the sexually-charged Amazon girl. Each movement 
of her mouth, each groap of her hands as they took hold Ukyo&#39;s assets at 
will, reflected her love equally. 

Ukyo was taken back by this, but eventually settled in a began to enjoy 
herself, retuning the kiss and holding her Chinese beauty like a lover 
should. It ended softly with both their bodies pressed together with 
matching blushes on their faces. 

&quot;Hee! Hee! Good morning sugar....do I get a morning kiss like that 
everyday?&quot; &quot;Yea....&quot; Said Shampoo with a voice full of mischieveious 
joy, while she squeezed her girlfriend a little more. &quot;...Shampoo always 
take time to love Airens!&quot; With a large grin on her face the chef 
brought her hands behind her and took hold of Shampoo&#39;s before bringing 
them in front of her and clashing them together with her own as they 
gave themselves a little space. 

With a warm smile on her face Ukyo then spoke. &quot;You still up for 
tonight?&quot; &quot;Huh! Try and stop Shampoo from spending night with Airens in 
Ukyo&#39;s room!&quot; With her usual cheeky grin, the young Amazon then moved 
her lips closer to Ukyo&#39;s ear to whisper. &quot;..and besides, we have lots 
and lot of....&#39;fun&#39;! Hee! Hee!&quot; 

Ukyo couldn&#39;t help but giggle at this. &quot;Hee! Hee! O Shampoo! Ever since 
you lost you virginity, you&#39;ve turned into a real nymphomaniac! Every 
time we&#39;re together I can see you&#39;ve got sex on the brain!!&quot; 
&quot;Well...Shampoo love to mate! Shampoo love being nudie with Airens. 
Shampoo love it all!! It addictive!&quot; &quot;Hee! Hee! I suppose there&#39;s worse 
things you could be addicted to!&quot; Suddenly, Ukyo&#39;s heart became heavier 
as her grin was replaced by a more neutral expression, she let go of her 
Chinese lover and then knelt down to pick up her broom. 

She let out a long, reflective sigh before standing and looking back up 
to Shampoo, who didn&#39;t expect Ukyo to let go so quickly. &quot;...I&#39;ve got to 
get back to work Shampoo, and it breaks my heart every time we&#39;ve got to 
leave each other.&quot; She said softly, brushing the back of her hand gently 
against her girlfriend&#39;s cheek lovingly, prompting her to blush. &quot;Aww. 
Ukyo no worry. Shampoo be back real soon! Shampoo go to Akane&#39;s house 
now. Shampoo see Akane and Ranma then Shampoo come back here before she 
goes to Cat Cafe! That ok?&quot; 

A small grin now invaded the chef&#39;s face before she took two steps 
forward pressing her ample frame against that of Shampoo, bringing her 
lips right up to the lobe of her ear before she whispered. &quot;Shampoo...do 
me a favour... don&#39;t see me again till tonight...&quot; Shampoo looked 
shocked at this request, before whispering her reply. &quot;W...w...why 
Ukyo?&quot; Ukyo answered with a light kiss on her cheek. &quot;I want to increase 
the anticipation for us. It&#39;ll make it even sweeter when we see each 
other again...&quot; Finished Ukyo, with a touch of seduction in her voice. 

With starry eyes of excitement Shampoo backed off. &quot;Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee! 
That great idea! Oooo! Ukyo so kinky!!!&quot; This caused Ukyo&#39;s cheeks to 
turn crimson, while Shampoo leapt back onto her bike with her usual 
grace and got ready to move again. &quot;B..bye Shampoo sugar...&quot; Said the 
chef trying her best to contain her embarrassment at being called 
&#39;kinky&#39;. 

&quot;Bye Ukyo. See you tonight!!&quot; And with that Shampoo was gone like 
grease-lightning, her wake blowing at Ukyo&#39;s clothes and hair as well as 
blowing the dust that Ukyo had just swept up. Then she was gone. 

With a small smile on her face, Ukyo shook her head, before getting back 
to her sweeping... 

===================================================================== 

It took the athletic Amazon only moments to reach the dojo. She set 
herself up, and leapt her bike up onto the fence cycling around it until 
she got to the side of the house where Akane&#39;s room was. She then left 
her bike, perfectly balanced on the fence and then leapt over to Akane&#39;s 
window, and into her room. 

&quot;NIHAO! Akane! Come for morning kiss! Akane? Akane?&quot; 

The room was empty, Akane wasn&#39;t there. Shampoo scratched her head a 
little before making her way to the door. &quot;Akane? Where is Shampoo&#39;s 
Cute Girl? AKANE! A-KAN-EEEEEE!!!&quot; She entered the hallway. &quot;Akane? 
Akan-&quot; She could hear running water from the bathroom, this caught her 
attention and drew her to there. &quot;Hmm...maybe Akane in here?&quot; She said 
this to herself while easing the door open. It was fairly misty inside, 
someone was using the furo. 

Cautiously Shampoo ventured deeper into the sweet-smelling fog, not as 
hindered by privacy issues as her Japanese friends were. She found her 
way to the rinsing area, and sat on the stool was a very soapy girl 
washing herself. 

From what she could see, Shampoo recognised the body that was before 
her, it had to be Akane. Silently she crept up behind the girl, wanting 
to take her by surprise. 

&quot;NIHAO AKANE!!!&quot; Screamed the Chinese girl with a voice of full of joy, 
mere seconds before the girl rinsed the soap off her body with the hand 
shower. Then Shampoo could see....it wasn&#39;t Akane, she knew every inch 
of her Airen&#39;s body, this was another Tendo. The girl raised to her feet 
and with a flick of her wet hair she turned her body to face the Amazon 
girl.... and then Shampoo could see...Kasumi standing naked in front of 
her. 

Shampoo stood frozen with embarrassment and with awe as she looked upon 
the eldest Tendo in her nakedness. With a glistening coat of water 
rolling over her softened skin, Kasumi&#39;s beauty was now amplified. 
Normally Kasumi looked fairly normal to Shampoo, but seeing her like 
this, seeing every little curve and concavity of her body and for once 
seeing her hair as nature intended it to flow...turned Shampoo on. Like 
any true Amazon, Shampoo found natural beauty the most attractive, and 
Kasumi was full of it. 

And so...like a dumb teenager with a crush, Shampoo stood there like a 
dope with a pair of crimson red cheeks and her eyes focused squarely on 
Kasumi&#39;s ample bust, while the Tendo girl, unable to feel embarrassment 
herself, just smiled warmly while she spoke. &quot;Oh, hello Shampoo. Were 
you looking for Akane?&quot; Too embarrassed to speak right now, Shampoo gave 
a little nod, still keeping her eyes focused on Kasumi&#39;s nudity. Kasumi 
continued to smile like she always does, despite the fact that Shampoo 
could see her au-naturel and dripping wet. 

&quot;Well then. I think she&#39;s in the dining room, you should try there.&quot; 
&quot;T...th...thank you, Ka...su...mi...&quot; Stammered the Chinese girl still 
embarrassed by all of this. Just when Shampoo was starting to get used 
to this, Kasumi did something to embarrass her even more....she moved. 
Using graceful strides of her legs, the Tendo girl moved her body over 
the threshold of the furo&#39;s bath and then lowered herself into it&#39;s warm 
waters. Those movements naturally caused her assets to heave and jiggle, 
sending Shampoo&#39;s already high arousal, even higher. 

&quot;I&#39;m really glad this wedding is happening Shampoo, I&#39;ve always wanted 
to make a wedding cake-&quot; Commented the Tendo Girl merrily while she 
relaxed and soaked herself in the bath. 

&quot;-just promise me this Shampoo....take care of her.&quot; 

The unusually serious way Kasumi said that caught Shampoo off-guard, so 
much so that her embarrassment dissipated. From that phrase alone, 
Shampoo could read Kasumi&#39;s care for her sister, and it gave her pride 
that she could reply positively to that. &quot;Of coarse! Shampoo will always 
care of Akane. When Amazon take mate, it for life! Amazon religion 
demands it, and so does Shampoo&#39;s heart!&quot; 

&quot;Oh my...&quot; Replied Kasumi with her trademark phrase. &quot;...you really do 
love her a lot. Good. She will be happy. Now I hope you find her.... 
..she&#39;s around here somewhere...&quot; 

&quot;Thank you Kasumi, have nice bath now, Shampoo go find her airen....&quot; 
&quot;Bye Shampoo...&quot; 

The Amazon then marched herself military-style out of the bathroom and 
back to the hallway. Then it all sank in again, seeing Kasumi naked, 
seeing all of her &#39;bits&#39; move, arousal now filled her body, with the 
crimson cheeks to match. 

&quot;Kasumi is so beautiful...&quot; She said with sparkling eyes. &quot;...and Kasumi 
looks like Akane-&quot; Shampoo then managed to excite herself some more with 
a realisation. Her eyes then widened while she clasped her hands 
together with glee. &quot;-Akane will look like that when she get&#39;s older!!! 
She&#39;ll look even cuter!!! YAY!!!&quot; Jubilant, the young Amazon hopped 
around merrily while she giggled. 

This celebration eventually ended when Akane appeared from the 
stairwell. She was heading for her room with a bundle of clothes in her 
arms, blissfully unaware of her girlfriend&#39;s presence, until it was too 
late. 

&quot;AKANE!!!&quot; 

The Tendo girl slowly turned to face the all too familiar voice of her 
Amazon bride-to-be, only to find her mere inches away. Shampoo had ran 
for her beloved and when she reached Akane, she gently felled her to the 
wooden floor with a soft thud, before proceeding to smother her with 
little love-bites and kisses, not even allowing her a good chance to 
breath, let alone a chance to speak. 

Eventually, Shampoo relented, satisfied with laying over her Akane, 
breathing heavily with passion while she stared into the confused and 
almost frightened eyes of her Airen. &quot;Emm....G...Good Morning 
Shampoo...what are you doing here?&quot; Stammered the brunette while she 
tried to catch her own breath. &quot;Looking at Akane&#39;s beautiful 
eyes....Shampoo could stare at them forever...&quot; Replied the Chinese girl 
with a gasp of amorous delight. 

That response helped Akane to relax into a more subdued frame of mind, 
and while she gazed into Shampoo&#39;s eyes, she lost herself in their 
depths. 

&quot;Hee! Hee! Akane is hypnotised so easily...&quot; &quot;H...how do you do it? I 
can&#39;t stop looking at you...&quot; &quot;Ohh...that old Amazon trick. Shampoo 
never tell, never know when she might want hypnotise Akane again. Make 
Akane do *anything* Shampoo wants!&quot; &quot;A...Anything?&quot; Whimpered Akane when 
Shampoo began to lower her head closer, her smile now dissolving into a 
mouth that would kiss. &quot;(Yes....anything....and now Akane..give Morning 
Kiss...you not able to resist...........give in...&quot; 

And with that, Akane whimpered yet again while she was enveloped by 
Shampoo who gripped her mouth with lips filled with care, starting a 
deep heart-filled kiss, the only kind Shampoo knew. 

For several minutes they stayed there on the ground kissing and holding 
one another and eventually rolling around the floor, swaying from side 
to side as sounds of their joined mouths echoed down the corridor. 

They were so into this...that they didn&#39;t even notice a new arrival into 
the scene. Soun...had come up the stairway and was only moments on the 
second floor before he saw the tangled bodies that was his daughter and 
Shampoo. His jaw hit the floor, and then he turned grey as he froze on 
the spot. His shock was immeasurable, his little girl...kissing another 
one, not innocently like he always believe was ok, but with passion and 
force, a full French kiss, apparently devoid of any Japanese pride. 

Eventually he thawed and made his way cautiously past them. He needed to 
get used to this, but he couldn&#39;t go from 0 to 60 in a mere couple of 
days, so he left them alone. 

After a few moments more of playful tussling the couple, now holding 
each other, lay side-by-side kissing softly. It was all going fine until 
Shampoo&#39;s cheeky streak came into play. Without any notice or warning, 
Akane could now feel her skirt lifted, over her knees and then over her 
very hips, exposing her underwear and before she could even react, 
Shampoo had already gotten a hand underneath them. 

&quot;Please Shampoo, stop.&quot; Gasped the Tendo Girl urgently after removing 
her lips from her significant other, only prompting an slightly upset 
response from the emotional melting pot that was Shampoo. 

&quot;But....but....but.....but....but------but Shampoo thought Akane liked 
to mate with Shampoo. Is....is that no longer true?&quot; 

The Japanese girl who then proceeded to put a loving hand on her 
girlfriend&#39;s cheek now wore a warm reassuring smile. &quot;Of coarse I love 
being with you Shampoo, but not here, not out in the hallway. If my 
father saw us like this, it would freak him out!&quot; Commented Akane, 
unaware of the witness to their kiss. 

And so with that, the romance ended for now, with the girls helping each 
other to their feet. 

&quot;Grr! Shampoo has lost her horny!&quot; Grumbled the Amazon while she helped 
Akane pick up the clothes she dropped during their passion. 

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry Shampoo. You&#39;ll get it back. You&#39;re easier to turn on 
than a light switch!&quot; Replied Akane jokingly helping her Chinese belle 
to smile again. 

&quot;Yea, Akane right. Now...help Shampoo get her horny back. Tell Shampoo 
all the smutty details of last night!&quot; Akane was confused, what was the 
girl talking about. 

&quot;Last night? What about last night Shampoo?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t play coy with Little Shampoo-&quot; Teased the Amazon while 
rubbing against her Airen playfully. &quot;-you and Ranma spent first night 
alone together as couple. Shampoo wants to hear *everything*! Every 
little cute and sexy detail!&quot; 

For some reason this was an uncomfortable topic for the Tendo who seemed 
to physically shy away for Shampoo as she spoke. &quot;Well...uh...&quot; She 
stammered. &quot;...we....we didn&#39;t actually *do* anything.&quot; 

Shampoo took a step back. &quot;Nothing? Not even kiss?&quot; Akane shook her 
head. &quot;I gave him a peck on the cheek, before we went to bed, then that 
was it. I was so nervous and I think he was too. We never really relaxed 
until we left each other.&quot; The Amazon couldn&#39;t believe this, she didn&#39;t 
want to. &quot;This NOT RIGHT! Airen couples must spend time together like 
Shampoo and Akane and Ukyo! Akane and Ranma LIVE together. Should be 
mating many times a day!&quot; A shade of crimson now invaded Akane. 

&quot;I should be having THAT much sex with him?&quot; Asked a shocked and 
embarrassed Tendo girl. 

&quot;YES! It Amazon tradition! How does Akane expect to get babies if she 
not mating continuously?!&quot; 

&quot;B...babies?&quot; Murmured the now livid Japanese girl who&#39;s face glowed red 
like a beacon. &quot;Yes, babies. Now-&quot; Shampoo then gently grasped Akane&#39;s 
hand and started to lead her down the stairs. &quot;-Shampoo try and fix 
this. It not right to live as lovers and not love...&quot; 

================= 

In the dojo...was Ranma. He had been there since early morning, 
practicing his form. This was typical behaviour on his weekend, but it 
never lasted this long, something was wrong. You could see it with each 
move, they were done with pain, as if he wanted to use that pain to 
distract himself from something else, something he didn&#39;t want to face. 

Why didn&#39;t he kiss Akane last night? Why didn&#39;t he touch her as he did 
the night before? Why is he so confused now? Surly it was simple, the 
girl loved him, he felt the same himself, so what was wrong? The fact 
that he couldn&#39;t conquer this, made him restless, how could he be beaten 
by an emotion? The dishonour of it. 

He was so wound up, that she couldn&#39;t even see an incoming attack. 
&quot;NIHAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!&quot; Screamed the Amazon from mid-air, before 
landing square on Ranma&#39;s back, latching onto his neck and wrapping legs 
around his waist. Despite her &#39;attack&#39; Shampoo&#39;s nimble frame wasn&#39;t 
heavy enough to bring Ranma to the ground, and so he stayed on his feet 
while she spoke lovingly into his ear. 

&quot;Wow. That was easy. Is Ranma Danger Sense gone sleepy? Shampoo could 
have caught Ranma and put him in love binds. Hee! Hee! Kidnap Ranma, 
like Shampoo always wanted to do!&quot; 

Ranma barely even noticed, he didn&#39;t seem to care, even when Shampoo 
dismounted him and slid around for her &#39;Morning Kiss&#39;. A warm smile 
preceded her kiss which she engaged with the feeling she always used. 
But Shampoo couldn&#39;t get into it, she had a hard time enjoying this 
kiss, Ranma wasn&#39;t responding to her, it was almost like kissing a 
statue. 

She let go, and took a step back, looking at Ranma&#39;s neutral face, not 
sure what he was feeling. She looked a little confused. She expected it 
to be easier to seduce the martial artist now that she had mated with 
him, but no, it seemed to be even harder now. Shampoo could now see why 
Akane didn&#39;t get close to him. Naturally, she wasn&#39;t pleased with this. 

&quot;AIYA! Ranma! What the problem!? People like getting lovely kiss, 
especially if that kiss come from cute girl!! What wrong?!!!&quot; No 
response, he just stared into space. &quot;Grrr! RANMA!!! Don&#39;t be like this 
to your Airenkallata!! Shampoo made a bond with you.....Sh...Shampoo 
mated with you. Is there no connection?&quot; A small burst of emotional rage 
now dissipated into tears, and that got Ranma&#39;s attention. 

He looked down and only seemed to notice the girl now. &quot;Shampoo?&quot; He saw 
her now tear-filled eyes and began to soften a little. 
&quot;What&#39;s.....what&#39;s wrong? Did someone upset you?&quot; Shampoo didn&#39;t seem to 
mind his inept question, the fact that he seemed to care gave her some 
comfort and some licence to latch herself on to him for support, taking 
him by surprise. 

Ranma&#39;s body-heat calmed her down a little. It was enough to make her 
feel somewhat better. &quot;Ranma-&quot; She uttered, with some of her mouth 
smothered by Ranma&#39;s chest. &quot;-don&#39;t make Shampoo cry. Shampoo cry so 
easy now, now that she has proper Airens. But Ranma....you make Shampoo 
cry most...every weekend, every day, Shampoo waited for you to call, to 
come to Cat Cafe....just to say hello....maybe go out..... ..but you 
never came Ranma....it....it made Shampoo cry everyday. Everyday, until 
Shampoo joined with Ukyo....and that cute girl over there-&quot; Said the 
Amazon as she pointed over to the Tendo girl, who stood patiently at the 
entrance of the Dojo, watching them. 

&quot;-her love keep Shampoo going Ranma. Ranma needs to know that Shampoo 
feels the same...about both of you.&quot; When she finished spilling her 
heart she took a step back from him and then smiled. &quot;*Phew* Sorry! 
Shampoo just needed to get that off chest!&quot; She said with a giggle. 
&quot;Shampoo all better now. It good to get things off chest, yes?&quot; &quot;I....I 
suppose...&quot; Replied Ranma, who was starting to thaw a little. 

&quot;Hee! Hee! Does Ranma *like* Shampoo&#39;s chest?&quot; Now the Chinese girl&#39;s 
cheeky streak had kicked in and had succeeded to embarrass Ranma with 
her seductive question. &quot;Y...your chest?&quot; &quot;Yes.....does Ranma like the 
way it bounces?&quot; He was too shocked to reply. &quot;Shampoo like a bouncy 
chest. Akane&#39;s is bouncy, so is Ukyo&#39;s. Oh....but Shampoo&#39;s favourite 
has to be yours....Ranma&quot; She said with a wink. &quot;M...m...m..mm, mine?&quot; 

&quot;Hee! Hee! You&#39;re cute when nervous! Yes Ranma, when you girl, you got 
lovely bouncy chest! It go- Bouncy! Bouncy! Bouncy! Bouncy!-&quot; She said 
this while bouncing up and down herself, demonstrating how she liked a 
chest to be. &quot;-and more bouncy like that! See?&quot; Ranma&#39;s embarrassment 
now amused both of the girls. So much so, that Akane now giggled lightly 
from behind her hand. Shampoo heard this and looked back. &quot;Oh....Akane 
like that?&quot; 

The Tendo girl nodded with a smile of laughter. The Amazon then returned 
her attention back to her first Airen. &quot;That show especially for Ranma! 
Aww-&quot; She latches onto him yet again, no warning given. &quot;-Ranma all 
nervous? Ranma not know how to be with girls? Shampoo not mind. Shampoo 
will be very patient and teach how. It will be fun, yes?&quot; She added with 
a very soft tone of voice. 

Ranma just looked at her blankly, still a little off-balance from the 
&#39;bouncy breast show&#39; he had been given by her. &quot;Oh...Ranma too too 
turned on to answer? That ok. Shampoo understand. If Akane or Ukyo do 
cute thing to turn on Shampoo, Shampoo is all dopey for hour. Emm.....oh 
yes! Shampoo, Akane and Ukyo having party tonight Ranma!&quot; She announced 
with eyes of sparkling optimism. 

&quot;It will be so so fun. We spend night at Ukyo house, sleep together, oh 
and yes...Hee! Hee! (We all nudie too!)&quot; The Chinese girl whispers this 
with a coy smile on her face. &quot;It only for Airens! So that includes 
Ranma! That if Ranma want to come. Shampoo hopes Ranma comes. Will Ranma 
come?&quot; Each time she mentioned Ranma&#39;s name she inched her head closer 
to that of the cursed boy/girl. Ranma stood rigidly, unsure of this 
kind, and smiling, Amazon face which always seemed to threaten to kiss 
him, if he ever let his guard down. 

&quot;I...I don&#39;t know.&quot; Came the stuttered response, eventually. &quot;Ohh. Ok-&quot; 
Replied Shampoo, the excitement in her voice, a little muted by that 
response. &quot;-But....If Ranma get urge in middle of night, if Ranma want 
to mate with self, don&#39;t! Just come over to Shampoo and Airens, we help 
you out! (Oh and Ranma-)&quot; She whispered into his ear. &quot;(-Shampoo will 
help Ranma out *any* time he needs it!)&quot; She finished that with a wink, 
recharging Ranma&#39;s cheeks with a shade of crimson. 

On that note, Shampoo decided to leave her Airen in style, so she kissed 
lightly on his reddened cheek and them somersaulted all the way back to 
Akane, who had patiently waited at the entrance since Shampoo had 
delivered her there minutes before. 

&quot;Shampoo got to go now Akane....&quot; 

Announced the Amazon, moments before squeezing one of her Airen&#39;s 
breasts, taking the Tendo girl totally by surprise. 

&quot;(....see you tonight....)&quot; Finished Shampoo with a seductive whisper 
and a wink, before she darted away, leaving an embarrassed Akane behind. 

The second Shampoo had let go of her, the Tendo girl instinctively 
guarded her chest with her arms and then began looking inward shyly, 
with radiant cheeks of red. Akane was embarrassed by Shampoo&#39;s 
&#39;Manhandling&#39; of her, but she was pleased by it too. 

=========================== 

The sound the of the Amazon&#39;s bike bell being rung and the clatter of 
the Dojo&#39;s fence as Shampoo travelled along it, signalled to Akane that 
she had left, waking her from her mini-coma of embarrassed pleasure. 

Now the words of her girlfriend rung around her head. Why wasn&#39;t she 
sleeping with Ranma now? She may not of being trying for a baby like 
Shampoo appeared to want, but still, the love was there, but why no 
affection? Why no sex? This required some work on her part... ..at least 
she believed that. 

She wore a little smile now, to match the feeling in her heart. Akane 
was happy, why wouldn&#39;t she be, she had two loving girlfriends after 
all, but she could be happier. Now was the time to chance luck. 

She now slowly advanced towards Ranma, who had resumed his workout of 
pain. 

&quot;That was sure weird...&quot; Spouted Ranma while he broke a sweat. 

&quot;Have you ever known that girl to be normal?&quot; Replied Akane with a voice 
of softness, almost transmitting her love of the girl with it. 

&quot;Yea, sure....&quot; Countered Ranma, almost ignoring Akane. 

The Tendo girl&#39;s eye twitched a little. Some anger entered her soul, 
thanks to Ranma&#39;s insulting reply, but she bet it down, and tried to 
stay &#39;sweet&#39;. 

&quot;Emm...you know Ranma. She was right. We&#39;re lovers now, we should be 
close... We should be like how Shampoo and Ukyo are to me and each 
other....&quot; 

Ranma seemed to ignore her, and just continued his training. A pressure 
vein now formed on the Tendo girl&#39;s forehead, her patience was starting 
to wear thin. 

&quot;Grrr...Ranma! Are you even listening to me?! I&#39;m pouring my heart out 
here!&quot; 

&quot;Yea....that&#39;s great....&quot; He said, continuing his ignorance. 

The Tendo girl now twitched with anger. &quot;I&#39;m...trying...to...tell you... 
..how....I....FEEL!!!&quot; Snarled the girl from behind her teeth. 

&quot;Uh huh. Listen Akane, just tell me that stuff later, I&#39;m busy now.&quot; 
That was it, Akane&#39;s anger bubble now burst with the usual grace she 
used. 

&quot;RANMA NO BAKA!!!!!!&quot; She yelled wielding her massive mallet, heading 
straight for Ranma. 

Screaming with her weapon in hand she set her self up for attack and 
then swung the mallet down toward her fiencee&#39;s head. 

But then she stopped... 

She stopped her attack with the mallet hovering mere inches from Ranma&#39;s 
head. Something stopped her from whacking him like she usually did. She 
couldn&#39;t understand it at first, she usually assaulted him when he 
pissed her off. But then it was a little clearer to her. She loved the 
guy, and just because he was thoughtless jerk, it wasn&#39;t enough of a 
reason to do this now. 

The fact that she hadn&#39;t hit him now caught Ranma&#39;s attention, he now 
looked Akane in the eye. At first he saw she strain of the attack on her 
face, but as Akane looked back him, that face melted in to a softer 
visage that grew a smile. And with that smile she tapped him on the head 
with her weapon and then withdrew. 

&quot;Don&#39;t be a baka Ranma...&quot; She uttered softly, now that she had his 
attention. &quot;...I know you&#39;re a nice guy really.&quot; She turned face and 
started to make her way out. &quot;Emm....sorry Akane.&quot; The Tendo girl 
stopped in her tracks. What was that? An genuine apology from Ranma? She 
had to ask when she turned to face him. 

&quot;What did you say Ranma?&quot; 

&quot;I said I&#39;m...sorry. I was being a baka....I&#39;m.....sorry.&quot; 

Akane was pleasantly surprised, he meant it. 

&quot;That is so nice of you Ranma.....listen....I&#39;d like you to come 
tonight. It&#39;ll be fun. You&#39;ve seen how crazy Shampoo gets when she&#39;s 
naked with us, so you know what it&#39;ll be like!&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll...think about it.&quot; Replied Ranma, trying his best not to be a 
baka. 

This appeased Akane, so much so that she smiled. 

&quot;Well then &#39;Ranchan&#39; I&#39;ll see you tonight.&quot; She then winked before 
making her way out of the dojo. 

Ranma just watched her departure in silence. This was a little weird, 
they were behaving like his girlfriends now, but they weren&#39;t fighting. 
Despite the fact that he knew about their romances, them working 
together like that....confused the hell out of him. 

He desperately wanted to understand... 

========================================================= 

Over at Ucchan&#39;s, there was a far more tranquil scene. The restaurant 
had a handful of regulars in for their lunchtime fix. It was slow and 
quiet, fairly typical for a Saturday, with a buzzing hum of conversation 
while Ukyo patrons talked among themselves. 

Nabiki manned the till, and did so like a master. This was nothing to 
her, trying to run her home of all places, like a business, made this 
look like child&#39;s play. The customers had only just been given their 
food, so Nabs had very little to do, it would be a while until anyone 
had to pay. She was starting to get a little bored by this, dropping her 
shoulders as if the tedium was weighing them down. Thankfully though, 
her idle time was interrupted by Ukyo&#39;s entry to the room. 

&quot;Nabiki...will you hold the fort for a few minutes? I need to go out to 
get stuff for tonight.&quot; Announced the chef while she slung a carrier bag 
over her shoulder. &quot;Sure. It should be not problem&quot; Responded the Middle 
Tendo with her usual voice of cool logic. &quot;Thanks sugar. If anyone comes 
in looking for food, I&#39;ve already got the servings ready in the kitchen 
oven. If anyone orders something off the menu, just get Konatsu, he&#39;s 
out back.&quot; &quot;Sure...see you later Ukyo.&quot; &quot;&#39;kay, Bye sugar.&quot; 

With that, Ukyo was gone, leaving Nabiki to toil at her post of tedium. 
Nabiki could only handle being idle for so long, and so she got up and 
wandered into the kitchen to stretch her legs. When she got there, 
something caught her attention. It sounded like grunting from the back 
of Ucchan&#39;s. At last, she thought, something unusual to tax her mind. 

Nabs went out back, only to see that the grunting noises were coming 
from Konatsu, who was deep in practice. What Nabiki saw, astonished her. 
Konatsu&#39;s moves were complex, yet done with incredible speed and 
stealth. The Middle Tendo just watched in awe, before making her 
presence know. &quot;....that&#39;s an interesting technique....&quot; She muttered 
out loud catching the ninja off-guard. 

&quot;What the? Oh....Hi Nabiki.&quot; Came a half-mumbled response when the ninja 
tried to get back into form again. &quot;What are you doing out here 
Konatsu?&quot; Asked the Middle Tendo with genuine interest. Konatsu was far 
different to the guys she was used to, besides the fact that he looked 
like a girl, and he seemed worthy of her notice. 

&quot;Me? I&#39;m just training. Need to keep my skills sharp.&quot; He said, while 
continuing to practice his Martial Art. &quot;What you are doing is far 
different from what we teach at our Dojo....what is it?&quot; 

&quot;This...is....very..&quot; Spouted Konatsu whilst breaking a sweat. 
&quot;..different to what a normal Dojo would teach. It is a form of Tie Kwan 
Doe, the art of the assassin, the art of the Ninja.&quot; 

&quot;The art of the Ninja? Doesn&#39;t that mean you can hide in the shadows, 
and stay virtually invisible?&quot; Asked Nabiki, genuinely interested in 
this &#39;kind&#39; skill. Konatsu stopped in his tracks again and then looked 
towards Nabiki. She was interested in his abilities? But....why? 
Regardless of her motives, Nabiki&#39;s interest pleased the young ninja, 
who was all to happy to explain while Nabs slowly made her way over to 
him. 

&quot;You really want to know about it?&quot; Asked Konatsu in astonishment. 
Nabiki just nodded, confirming that. &quot;Well....yea you&#39;re sort of right. 
Part of my skills is staying hidden. But that is only a small part of 
it. Just keeping silent takes practice.&quot; The Scheming Centre of Nabiki&#39;s 
brain now when into overdrive. With such a skill, she could make a small 
mint. 

&quot;So....&quot; She commented whilst rolling her eyes sky-ward. &quot;...you could 
hide anywhere, do anything and never be seen or heard?&quot; &quot;Well, yea, 
that&#39;s the idea. A coy smile of greed now found a home on Nabiki&#39;s face. 
&quot;Even take pictures of people....in...say...less-than dignified 
positions...&quot; Konatsu was naturally uneasy about that implication. 
&quot;Well....yea....if the camera was quiet...you could to that....&quot; 

&quot;Really? Hmm....Konatsu?&quot; &quot;Yes Nabiki?&quot; &quot;Could you teach me?&quot; &quot;T...teach 
you?&quot; &quot;Yes. Please....I&#39;d like to learn this.&quot; 

Konatsu was taken back, never before had he been asked to teach. 
&quot;Well...I&#39;ve never done it before.....Emm....what do you learn at your 
Dojo?&quot; &quot;My Dojo? That is the &#39;Anything Goes&#39; school of Martial Arts. I 
was never any good at it, despite my father&#39;s best efforts. I most 
concentrate on my aerobics.&quot; &quot;Aerobics, huh? Well that&#39;s a start, it 
should make you flexible...&quot; 

&quot;Oh...do you *prefer* to work with flexible girls Konatsu?&quot; Asked the 
Middle Tendo in a playful, almost taunting voice. This question managed 
embarrass the ninja, something Nabs seemed to enjoy doing, for some 
reason. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean it THAT way!&quot; He said with crimson cheeks. 
&quot;Listen...I&#39;ll show you some basic forms later. It&#39;ll take too long to 
do now and if Ukyo catches you out of your post she&#39;ll....&quot; 

&quot;Yea, yea. I know. Thank you Konatsu, that is kind of you.&quot; A light 
breeze now blew through the alley, sending a shiver down the Tendo 
Girl&#39;s spin. &quot;Brrr...It&#39;s getting a little choppy out here-&quot; She said 
while rubbing her shoulders. &quot;-we don&#39;t we head inside to the warmth?&quot; 

Konatsu smiled in agreement, then proceeded inward with Nabiki. This was 
pleasant surprise for him...he had always heard that Nabiki was a 
heartless money-grabber. But right now, she seemed....nice. Perhaps when 
she is alone like that, she&#39;s a human being after all... 

....but they weren&#39;t alone. 

On the building opposite to the rear of Ucchan&#39;s, three shadows bore 
witness to their conversation. They watched, listened, sized up the 
ninja and his new friend, and then left. 

Something was up, in Nerima that day. 

======================================================================== 

Morning turned to day, then to evening and to night. Darkness now 
shrouded the streets of Nerima. The dance of the moths had now begun 
around the countless streetlights of the sleepy suburb. All those who 
should be at home were....well, almost everyone. 

At Okonomiyaki Ucchan&#39;s a Tendo Girl was still at work. Business had 
ended for the day and the door was locked shut, but Nabiki was still 
there, doing Ukyo&#39;s books. She was there alone in the restaurant sitting 
in one of the booths, with coffee in one hand and an Adding-Machine in 
the other. She had spent the evening in the depths of accounting bliss, 
undisturbed...until now. Ukyo had arrived from upstairs, barefoot, 
wearing only her bathrobe. 

&quot;Hey Nabs! How you doing?&quot; She asked in her usual cheerful manner while 
walking towards Nabiki&#39;s booth. &quot;Fine....My Goddess! How on earth did 
you keep out of the red for so long?!&quot; Exclaimed the Economic Tendo, 
straining her eyes on some fairly unbelievable figures. Ukyo sat down 
beside her new employee and looked at them too. 

&quot;I dunno. They just, worked themselves out I suppose.&quot; Replied the chef 
in innocent ignorance. &quot;Just worked out?! I&#39;ve spent the past 3 hours 
making Day Books out of your accounts! How could you just use a Balance 
Sheet?! &quot;Day Books? Balance Sheet? That kind of stuff makes my head hurt 
sugar. I&#39;m a martial artist cook. All I care about it what I spend and 
what my takings are, then once a year, my tax payment. That&#39;s all I do 
in accounting.&quot; 

&quot;That and countless little doodles and sub-par mini-mangas in the 
margins.&quot; Muttered Nabiki like an Accounting Teacher, scolding her 
student. 

&quot;Oh yea. Hee! Hee! Did you see yesterday&#39;s accounts?-&quot; Uyko proceeds to 
flip the books forward to that page. &quot;-See the cute picture of Shampoo 
and Akane kissing! Don&#39;t they look cute?&quot; She asked with a wide grin on 
her face. Nabiki looked down and then noticed a small scribbled Manga 
starring her sister and the Chinese girl. 

&quot;Akane: I&#39;m so lonely. No one loves me... Shampoo: Nihao Akane! 
Hey....why airen sad? Akane: I&#39;m alone, and sad. Ukyo died heroically to 
save me. Now I have no-one. Shampoo: (Crying) That so so sad. Ukyo was 
so pretty and kind! Akane: (Akane starts to cry as well.) Shampoo: Akane 
no cry! Shampoo love Akane! Akane: You do?! Oh..Shampoo. Kiss me! (They 
Kiss)&quot; 

Nabiki raises a curious eyebrow when she looked back at Ukyo&#39;s grinning 
face. 

&quot;Isn&#39;t it romantic?&quot; Asked the cook excitedly. 

&quot;Sure....I think I can now see why your books are in such a state.&quot; 
Muttered the Tendo Girl, returning to her number crunching. 

&quot;Awww...&quot; Ukyo now grips Nabiki&#39;s shoulders lovingly, grabbing the 
girl&#39;s attention, as well as her torso. &quot;...you&#39;re doing so much for me 
Nabs. I&#39;m not even paying you that much. Thank you for fixing up my 
accounts.&quot; 

In a small break from her usual character, Nabiki seemed a little 
embarrassed by the Chef&#39;s very personal exoneration. &quot;Well...&quot; Replied 
the Middle Tendo, her cheeks now slightly red. &quot;..it&#39;s nothing really. I 
just love doing this stuff, that&#39;s all.&quot; &quot;Anyway..&quot; Finished Ukyo with a 
small hug. &quot;...you&#39;re a big help. I see that hiring you was a good move. 
Listen...you don&#39;t have to finish that tonight.&quot; 

&quot;Well...like I said, I love doing this. It relaxes me. I think I&#39;ll 
finish before I go home.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, Ok-&quot; Ukyo gets up out of the booth. &quot;-you can still go home 
whenever you feel like it, just lock the door after you.&quot; Said Uyko with 
a warm smile. &quot;Oh and Nabs?&quot; 

&quot;Yes Ukyo?&quot; 

&quot;Do you know where Konatsu is?&quot; 

&quot;He&#39;s up in his room...&quot; Replied the Tendo girl, now with a pen in her 
mouth. 

&quot;Ok. I&#39;ll say goodnight then Nabs, I probably won&#39;t be back down again.&quot; 
Announced the cook with a light blush on her face. 

&quot;Why is that?&quot; Asked the Middle Tendo in total ignorance before hearing 
the audible giggles and noises of her sister and the Chinese girl 
playing, up in Ukyo&#39;s room. 

&quot;Forget I asked.&quot; Countered Nabiki, now realising her moment of 
stupidity, prompting some giggles from the Chef. &quot;Goodnight Nabs.&quot; She 
said still gripped by some soft giggles. &quot;Goodnight Ukyo. See you 
tomorrow.&quot; 

Then Nabs was let on her own, to finish her beloved book-keeping. 

======================================== 

Ukyo went up the stairs and now found herself at the door of Konatsu&#39;s 
bedroom. She rapped her fingers on it&#39;s wooden surface, hoping to get 
her housemate&#39;s attention, before speaking herself. &quot;Konatsu-&quot; She asked 
softly. &quot;-I&#39;m coming in. Ok?&quot; 

She slowly slid the door open and entered. 

Konatsu&#39;s room was a small box room, about 1/3 the size of Ukyo&#39;s. It 
was spartan, with only on small window to the back. This used to be a 
storage closet before Konatsu came to live with Ukyo, and little about 
it had changed. Only Konatsu&#39;s bed and a small locker furnished this 
room. A handful of Ninja-style posters and some Kanji banners decorated 
the walls. 

Konatsu was present in his room, lying on his bed, in the darkness 
before Ukyo came. He was thinking, thinking about a load of stuff, but 
one thing in particular was going thought it, and she had just entered 
the room. 

Ukyo found him in total darkness, but decided not to turn on the light 
when she came in. What came from hallway was enough for her to see, she 
didn&#39;t want to disturb him too much. 

&quot;Hey Konatsu...&quot; She whispered softly before sitting on the bed. He 
seemed to ignore her, just staring vacantly at the ceiling, his mind 
lost somewhere. Ukyo could read this, she could read him like a mother 
could, and her pseudo-maternal instincts told her all she needed to 
know. She skooched over, closer to his head, before placing a warm hand 
on the right cheek of his lonely looking face. 

&quot;You&#39;re in hell right now, aren&#39;t you sugar?&quot; She asked with genuine 
concern in her voice. Konatsu turned to face her, life now returned to 
his eyes. How did she understand? How did she know about the pain? &quot;How 
did you-&quot; His question was cut short when Ukyo lovingly gagged him with 
her middle and index fingers. &quot;-I can tell sugar. I once knew that pain. 
It&#39;s like there&#39;s a dagger stuck in your heart, and every day it digs 
deeper in, making you hurt more. What&#39;s worse is when you believe that 
the feeling will never go away. Then you just want to kill yourself, you 
don&#39;t see the point anymore.&quot; Konatsu listened intensely while Ukyo 
stared into space herself. 

&quot;There was a time sugar. A long time after my father abandoned me, when 
I felt that bad. But what was worse, was the feeling that no-one loved 
me. No-one in the world. Then I met Ranchan again, and he was a friend, 
but you know I wanted more. I wanted someone to love me, the deep kind 
of love that only a lover can give you. I had given up on it Konatsu, I 
had given up on ever finding that love. But...what-do-you-know...that 
love found me instead, and now I&#39;ve got two girlfriends, and Ranma to 
boot-&quot; 

She was now interrupted by noises from her bedroom. It sounded like 
Akane and Shampoo running around the room. Ukyo tell by their foot-falls 
that the Amazon Girl was chasing the Youngest Tendo. 

&quot;(Aiya! Akane come here!)&quot; Came Shampoo&#39;s muffled voice from beyond the 
dry-wall. 

&quot;(No! Keep away Shampoo!)&quot; Replied Akane, her voice heavy with giggles. 

&quot;(Akane going into Coomicoomi!)&quot; &quot;(Nooooo!!! Hee! Hee!)&quot; 

Some more chasing was now followed by a large thump, and then some more 
giggling from both of them. 

A huge grin now enveloped Ukyo&#39;s face while she listened to them. 
&quot;You&#39;re going to have sex with them now aren&#39;t you?&quot; Muttered the Ninja 
in a subdued tone of voice. This took hold of Ukyo&#39;s attention. &quot;Yea...&quot; 
Replied the chef, almost too ashamed to look at Konatsu. This was 
hurting him and Ukyo knew. 

&quot;Oh Konatsu sugar...yes I will probably make love to them. Shampoo 
doesn&#39;t really take &#39;No&#39; for an answer. She kinda pretends not to 
understand, but... ..if you don&#39;t do it to her, she&#39;ll rape you instead. 
Konatsu...I love them...I love them with that deep kind of love that 
goes all the way in. That&#39;s why I share my body and soul with them.&quot; 
Konatsu looks down even more depressed. 

&quot;But I do love you Konatsu, just not like that. You&#39;re my best friend 
sugar. You&#39;re always there for me! You&#39;re the best! And well....if 
someone ever came up to me with a gun and said &#39;Have sex with Konatsu or 
I&#39;ll kill you both&#39;, I&#39;d do it Konatsu, without hesitation, &#39;cause 
you&#39;re a nice guy and I like you.&quot; 

This boosted Konatsu&#39;s mood immeasurably. The fact that Ukyo said that 
she would willingly make love to him if she was forced into it, was good 
enough to fish him from the depths of despair. Now he wore a small 
smile, which delighted the chef. &quot;Yay! That&#39;s what I wanted to see! 
Listen sugar-&quot; She said while stroking his hair. &quot;-I&#39;m gonna go in with 
the girls now. Probably for the rest of the night. Nabs will be gone 
eventually. You&#39;ll have most of the place to yourself, and I know I 
don&#39;t have to ask you not to come into my room.&quot; 

She gets up from the bed and then walks towards the doorway, she&#39;s about 
to leave when something made her stop. Konatsu&#39;s happiness was important 
to her, and she knew the guy needed something to make him happy, and one 
idea had just entered her mind. 

She turned about to face Konatsu who was now looking down at his pillow. 
&quot;Oh Konatsu...&quot; Called the chef in a playful tone, prompting the ninja 
to look in her direction. 

When Ukyo saw that her friend was watching, she smiled softly, before 
taking hold of her bathrobe and slipping it off her shoulders. The soft, 
towel-like fabric slid it&#39;s way down Ukyo&#39;s torso and then fell to her 
feet with a soft thud. The chef stood naked in the doorway, all the time 
smiling while Konatsu looked at this beautiful body in total disbelief. 

&quot;You know I love you, sugar-&quot; Continued Ukyo in a voice that was as soft 
as a whisper. &quot;-please don&#39;t ever leave me. I need you. (Goodnight 
sugar.)&quot; She whispered her farewell before picking up her robe, slinging 
it over her shoulder and then leaving the room. Konatsu was treated to 
the full view of the chef&#39;s well-toned behind, before she slid the door 
closed after her. And with one final wink of her eye through the gap in 
the doorway, she closed it totally. 

================================== 

Her parenting duties over, the chef now made her way to the bedroom and 
the source of all the noises that had rocked the restaurant. 

She slid to door open to find Akane and Shampoo naked, and wrestling for 
control inside Shampoo&#39;s Coomicoomi, which was now laid out beside 
Ukyo&#39;s bed in the middle of the floor. 

Naturally, Shampoo was the stronger girl and now had Akane pinned to the 
floor. She took full advantage of this and wrapped her arms around the 
Tendo Girl trapping her in a loving embrace. It was at this stage that 
the girls noticed Ukyo&#39;s return. 

&quot;Ukyo! Help!&quot; Yelled out Akane in fictional peril. &quot;Shampoo forced me 
into here! I&#39;m afraid she&#39;ll do something crazy to me I---MFFFmfff&quot; 
Shampoo had somehow succeeded to gag the girl with one of her breasts. 
&quot;Quiet Akane! Airen must go into Coomicoomi when Shampoo command! And-&quot; 
Shampoo was now in fits of giggles as Akane had started to tickle her 
breast. &quot;Hee hee hee ha ah ha! Stop! Akane! Ohhhh. Nihao Ukyo, you 
smiling lots. Something nice happen?&quot; 

This took the chef by surprise, she didn&#39;t realise her smile until 
Shampoo pointed it out. &quot;Oh...Oh it&#39;s just Konatsu...&quot; She said while 
going over to her bed and lying bosom-first on it&#39;s sheets. &quot;...I let 
him see me naked. I know he always wanted to see me, and well...the 
little sugar deserved it, he&#39;s been so good about everything.&quot; 

&quot;Aww. That so so nice. Shampoo-&quot; She was cut short by some frantic 
muffing noises coming from her bust. The Amazon girl looked down to see 
her little brunette girlfriend struggling. With some reluctance, Shampoo 
freed Akane&#39;s mouth from her breast, and gave her some breathing space. 
&quot;But....Akane not like Shampoo breast? A....Akane not like being gagged 
by life-spring?&quot; Quizzed Chinese Girl, slightly upset now by Akane&#39;s 
behaviour. 

&quot;I love your breasts Shampoo, it&#39;s just that their soooo big! I couldn&#39;t 
breath!&quot; Replied a near-breathless Akane. Shampoo seemed to be appeased 
by that response, so she gave Akane a soft kiss on the forehead. &quot;That 
ok. Shampoo not mind if reason is good.&quot; A huge grin now enveloped the 
Amazon&#39;s face. &quot;Does Akane really think Shampoo breast is big?&quot; She 
asked with a concluding giggle. &quot;Well yea, they&#39;re much bigger than 
mine-&quot; Akane now shyed away, looking disappointed with herself. &quot;-I&#39;ve 
got the smallest of all of us. You two have got mountains, and even 
Ranma has bigger ones as a girl. I&#39;m as good as flat.&quot; 

&quot;No! Akane no say that! Akane got cute boobies! Shampoo love them!&quot; 
Akane blushed at that comment and then looked over to Ukyo. &quot;Do you 
think my chest is ok Ukyo?&quot; 

&quot;Ok? Akane sugar. It&#39;s more than ok. Shampoo is right your breasts are 
very cute. They are the smallest here, but size doesn&#39;t matter 
Akane-chan. It&#39;s the shape and ripeness of them that counts sugar, and 
yours are perfectly shaped with perfect little nipples decorating them 
like cherries on my favourite desert. They complement your body Akane, 
your breasts are cute, your ass is cute, your little nose, your eyes, 
your mouth...ohhh...it&#39;s all so cute. And put together it makes one 
incredibly beautiful girl that I love so much. So Akane...don&#39;t feel bad 
because you think your breasts are too small, &#39;cause I wouldn&#39;t have it 
any other way!&quot; 

By the time Ukyo had finished, Akane&#39;s face was engulfed in crimson. 
No-one had ever talked so well about her body before, and just looked up 
to Shampoo with starry eyes. &quot;Emm...yes. What Ukyo say. Shampoo feel 
that too. And Akane chest not flat, Shampoo feel breasts touching now, 
they round and juicy! They like melons!!&quot; An even darker shade of 
crimson now invaded the Tendo Girl&#39;s face, she couldn&#39;t cope with this. 
&quot;Oh! Stop it you two! You&#39;re too kind to me!&quot; She yelled in pleasure, 
too embarrassed to even look at them. 

- 

While Akane tried to cool down, Ukyo grabbed one of her magazines and 
opened it. &quot;Ahh....I love this, sugars. Having quality-time with you. 
Just lounging around naked like this, taking about stuff. I don&#39;t even 
want to have sex yet.&quot; Ukyo said this in pleased, subdued tone, which 
got Akane think that way herself. 

&quot;Yea...You&#39;re right Ukyo. Shampoo...I don&#39;t want to have sex just yet.&quot; 

Shampoo was taken back by this. &quot;No...no mate? But Shampoo want to mate 
with Akane.&quot; &quot;Well, you can wait a few minutes can&#39;t you?&quot; 
&quot;But....but.....Shampoo sworn to mate. Goddess want Shampoo to mate! 
Akane will mate if she like or not!&quot; 

Shampoo now began grip her Japanese girlfriend. &quot;No Shampoo, I don&#39;t 
wanna!&quot; &quot;It pointless Akane. No resisting Shampoo love. Power of love 
too much for Akane.&quot; While she whispered this seductive sentence of 
fate, the Amazon took hold of Akane&#39;s wrists and moved them together in 
a position above her head, and then with only one hand, she held them in 
place, effectively binding the arms together with her left hand. 

Akane was helpless now, all she could do now was struggle while she felt 
the soft right hand of Shampoo make it&#39;s way south, and then into her 
womanhood. &quot;Help Ukyo!&quot; Screamed out the Tendo Girl in a weird mix of 
extatic terror. Akane was in peril, but it was a pleasant peril in her 
girlfriend&#39;s hands. 

&quot;Help Ukyo! Shampoo&#39;s raping me!!&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s nice Akane.&quot; Came the calm reply of the Chef, who was now so 
relaxed in her nudity that she lay on the bed, reading her favourite 
magazine, and kicking her feet, knowing all to well that Akane was in no 
danger. 

Akane was sort of shocked, but in a playful way. She knew Ukyo was on 
her side, but right now she was in mock captivity. She was kinda hoping 
that Ukyo would be her knight-in-armour, to save her from the clutches 
of this sex-crazed Amazon Girl. But alas, that didn&#39;t happen. Shampoo 
now wore a far wider grin, knowing all too well that no rescue was 
coming for the Tendo Girl. 

And so Akane allowed herself to be taken, just as Shampoo had started to 
use one of her special &#39;skills&#39; on the girl, prompting her to 
hyperventilate. &quot;Oh! Shampoo!! That&#39;s not fair! Don&#39;t use a 
technique...on...me!&quot; 

Akane&#39;s pleading feel on deaf ears, Shampoo just continued to play with 
her womanhood, sending the girl to the hights of primal pleasure and 
lust. All this while Shampoo giggled in glee at her act of love. 

============================= 

Konatsu lay in his room, thinking. Ukyo&#39;s naked form, now etched into 
his mind. Every little contour and concavity. She looked far different 
than what he imagined. He had seen a naked girl before...even if it was 
Akane...but Ukyo was different. But this was weird. Ukyo, the girl he 
had always known and loved, in her natural state, with breasts....and 
pubic hair....and a behind. He used to only ever see her on a pedicle of 
beauty and grace. Now a new dimension appeared to him, Ukyo - as a 
sexual entity. 

It was a dream shattered, but also a dream rebuilt and re-enforced. Now 
he knew for certain. She was beautiful, naked or with clothes on, it 
didn&#39;t matter. But above all that, he learned this - Ukyo was a true 
friend. He knew that show was just to make him happy. And it did. 

&quot;(If only I could stop loving her with that &#39;deep love&#39;)&quot; Lamented the 
young Ninja out-load. 

&quot;Why should you?&quot; Replied a woman&#39;s voice from the shadows. 

Konatsu jumped and then noticed something in the shadow at the corner. 
&quot;Who are you?! What are you doing here?!!&quot; 

&quot;My name is Ryu. I am here to help you Konatsu.&quot; 

&quot;What? How do you know my name?&quot; 

&quot;I have been watching, young Ninja. I know how much you love her.&quot; 

&quot;Ukyo?&quot; 

&quot;Yes....Ukyo. I can give her to you. She will love you. A part of her 
already does, but that is Maternal Love. True...the love of a mother is 
nice, but it is not the kind you want.&quot; 

&quot;Make her love me? How?&quot; Konatsu remained on edge while asking this 
question. 

&quot;By helping me Konatsu. Help me to redirect her love for Xian Pu and 
Tendo Akane to you. What do you say to that?&quot; 

Konatsu stood there, thinking about it. But his decision was swift, and 
blunt. 

&quot;You....a freak-woman who hides in the shadows, who stalks me and Ukyo. 
You....want me to betray Ukyo. She loves those girls...and it makes her 
happy. And if she&#39;s happy, I&#39;M happy! I will not betray her for any 
price, not even for her own love. I would kill myself first.&quot; 

Ryu remained silent for a moment, before giving Konatsu a chilling 
response. 

&quot;Fine, young Ninja. I don&#39;t need you. But mark my words, you will soon 
regret that decision.&quot; 

Just as that sentence ended, Konatsu had pin-pointed where Ryu was, and 
with one bounding motion he grabbed a wooden sword from his bed-side and 
swung it at Ryu&#39;s position. But all he hit was air. 

Ryu...was gone. 

=============================== 

Back in Uyko&#39;s room, the atmosphere was far more festive. Ukyo was still 
lying on her stomach, in bed, while blissfully reading her magazine. 
However, something was missing. The girls were gone, now replaced by the 
noise of a running shower from Ukyo&#39;s bathroom. There, the echoed voices 
of Akane and Shampoo could be heard. 

&quot;Shampoo! Quit touching me there! I want to wash myself!&quot; Cried out the 
Tendo Girl in a weird mix of pleased frustration. 

&quot;But Shampoo like to touch ass! It so soft and it make slappy noises 
when Shampoo spanks!&quot; 

A load slap is then heard for the bathroom. 

&quot;OWWW! SHAMPOO! Oww...my ass!&quot; 

Shampoo just proceeded to giggle. 

&quot;Ohh....fine Shampoo. You can help me wash. Could you please scrub my 
back?&quot; 

&quot;Ok!&quot; 

Some silence, then.... 

&quot;I said my BACK!!! Not down there!! Ohh....oh....ohhhh&quot; Gasps and small 
moans of pleasure now emanated from the bathroom, catching the chef&#39;s 
attention. 

&quot;Girls! Behave in there! My shower isn&#39;t a sex-toy!&quot; 

&quot;It&#39; Shampoo&#39;s fault! She won&#39;t stop trying to have sex with me! Ohhh!&quot; 

&quot;Aiya?! Blame Shampoo?! That is it! Shampoo going to go hard now!&quot; 

Giggles, yelps and screams now resonated from the small room, followed 
by the sounds of the Amazon Girl working her girlfriend. 

&quot;Ohhhh...No fair! Shampoo you minx! Ohhh...&quot; 

The moans continued for a few minutes more, and by now Ukyo had started 
to ignore them, returning to her magazine. That was until she heard a 
light scream from Akane. 

&quot;NO! No Shampoo, I don&#39;t want to cum for you! Oh, I just washed down 
there!&quot; 

&quot;Shampoo never take &#39;no&#39; for answer! Akane start squirting for Shampoo!&quot; 

&quot;Damn it NO! Oh....Oh....oh. That&#39;s IT! I&#39;m gonna get you for that!&quot; 
Yelled the Tendo Girl mere before a snap and a scream could be hear 
coming from Shampoo. 

&quot;AYIA!! No do that to Shampoo! Oww! Akane not love any more? Oww! 
OWWWW!!&quot; 

A dripping wet Shampoo ran back into the bedroom with an equally wet 
Akane hot in pursuit with a wet towel in hand. The youngest girl then 
proceeded to chase the Amazon girl around the room, whipping her ass 
with her formidable weapon, inducing screams of terrified surprise from 
Shampoo. 

&quot;Oww! No! Do not whip Shampoo ass! Shampoo thought Akane like ass!&quot; 
Pleaded Shampoo before taking refuge at the wall. She planted herself 
bosom-first against the wooden panels of Ukyo&#39;s bedroom wall and then 
turned her head to face Akane with large doe-eyes, hoping for some 
mercy. 

But that didn&#39;t come, now that Akane had Shampoo trapped with her ass 
stuck out like a target, she began to whip her relentlessly. 

&quot;Oww! No....no...&quot; Screamed out Shampoo with a voice full of mock-tears. 
&quot;-no please! Have mercy for poor Shampoo...Shampoo just wanted to 
love...&quot; 

&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t!&quot; Countered Akane with a massive smile on her face. 
&quot;-Don&#39;t even attempt to guilt me! The second I let my guard down, you&#39;ll 
just rape me again! So instead, I&#39;ll just punish you!&quot; 

Then with some glee she continued whipping the girl she loved. 

Ukyo watched this, and with a smile on her face it was obvious that she 
was enjoying watching them. It may have looked like Akane and Shampoo 
were fighting each other, the chef knew well that they were really 
playing with each other and each whip that Akane dealt to Shampoo&#39;s 
behind was done with &#39;love&#39;, for want of a better word. 

&quot;You two are really enjoying that, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Commented Ukyo while she 
sat up to watch them. 

Akane stopped what she was doing and then faced her other girlfriend. 

&quot;Yea, actually, I am! Whipping Shampoo&#39;s sexy little ass is fairly 
therapeutic! Wanna have a go?&quot; Asked the Tendo Girl, who had now walked 
over to Ukyo and presented her with the towel. &quot;Sound&#39;s like fun...but 
naaa...better not, it looks a little swollen from all the whipping 
you&#39;ve done.&quot; 

By Shampoo had left the security of the wall and was now walking about, 
rubbing her injured hide, but she didn&#39;t seem to be in pain. 

&quot;I&#39;ve a feeling you liked that Shampoo...&quot; Asked the chef with a coy, 
all knowing, sound to her voice. &quot;Yes, it hurty, but nice kind of hurty 
that give Shampoo horny. But Akane was mean....&quot; Added the Amazon in a 
sad puppy-dug way, designed to guilt the Tendo Girl. But that didn&#39;t 
work. 

&quot;Humph! Serves you right!&quot; Countered Akane, with her arms folded and her 
nose sky-ward. &quot;-you got cum all over my legs, and I have just 
moisturised them!&quot; Some venom was in Akane&#39;s voice, but it was just mock 
venom she used to tease her Chinese girlfriend, and Shampoo knew that 
well. 

&quot;Oh come on Akane! You expect me to believe that you&#39;ve never thought of 
having sex in the shower before?&quot; Akane looks back at her eldest lover 
and stared at her with a blank face before replying. &quot;Well...no....we&#39;ve 
got a furo at our place. You don&#39;t really think about it.&quot; 

&quot;Oh yea..forgot.&quot; 

While the girls were talking, they had totally ignored the actions of 
Shampoo who had silently crept over to her bag. After a little silent 
rummaging, she produced a few long leather laces from it. Then...like a 
Lioness hunting her prey, she advanced towards Akane. She had some plan 
for the Tendo Girl, something that needed the element of surprise, and 
she knew that now....now was the perfect time to take her prey, when she 
least expected it. 

It was sudden. Jumping right into their conversation, Shampoo grabbed 
Akane from behind, pinned her arms behind her back and then brought her 
down to the floor. Before Akane knew what was happening, Shampoo had 
already begun wrapping the lace around her wrists. 

&quot;What the?! Oh no!! Help Ukyo!! Shampoo&#39;s tying me up!!!&quot; Wailing like a 
child, Akane struggled with her delighted captor who wore a bigger grin 
than usual now. &quot;UKYO PLEASE!!!!!&quot; Akane&#39;s mock peril fell on the ears 
of someone who was now a enthusiastic spectator of her capture. 

&quot;I dunno Akane. She might tie me up too if I do that. Besides, I like 
watch her bind you! It&#39;s so kinky of her!&quot; 

Akane felt so defeated now. Ukyo had forsaken her again to the mercy of 
this cute nut-bar called Shampoo. 

The knot was finished, but Shampoo still wasn&#39;t done yet, she wanted 
Akane&#39;s ankles bound and so she began on that now, much to the Tendo 
girl&#39;s horror. &quot;No!! Not the legs too!!&quot; 

&quot;Yes. Akane. Shampoo tie legs. This good bind. Akane no escape from 
dreaded Love Knot!!&quot; 

Sure enough, the Amazon was right. Once her legs were bound, she was 
totally helpless. No matter how hard she pulled on her binds, she 
couldn&#39;t free herself. 

&quot;What?! Nnnnnn! NNNNNnnn! What kind of crazy knot is this?!! I can&#39;t 
even put pressure on it!&quot; 

&quot;That Akane....is Amazon Love Knot. Most powerful tool of Amazon. Once 
bound...impossible to escape!!&quot; 

Shampoo stood back and admired her handiwork, while Akane rolled around 
the floor, struggling valiantly to free herself. 

Ukyo watched her bound girlfriend, and paid close attention to the knot 
that kept her under wraps. 

&quot;That &#39;Amazon Knot&#39; is like no other knot I&#39;ve ever seen. It&#39;s so 
complex...&quot; 

&quot;Thank you!&quot; Chirped the Amazon with a grin. &quot;It dreaded Amazon Love 
Knot! Best Amazon invention ever!&quot; 

&quot;What makes the knot so dreaded?&quot; Enquired Ukyo. 

&quot;Well...once bound, impossible to escape. Lovers use to tie up. Love is 
like rope, it tie you for life. Tying up for Amazon is sacred. We 
capture our lovers and bring them home to village. It like physical love 
of Airen. People dread Love Knot, because once it happen, they &#39;never&#39; 
escape!&quot; 

Akane whimpered upon hearing this. What hope would she have of escape, 
if generations of the Amazons&#39; captives hadn&#39;t a chance. 

&quot;Well that would explain how you Amazon girls manage to have children, 
with few men around. But..Physical Love? Isn&#39;t that just Sex?&quot; 

Shampoo was shocked at the implication. &quot;J...just mating?! It not JUST 
mating!! Binds make it fun, binds make it kinky and intimate. If Airen 
is tied, they give up all freedom to lover. They put trust in lover. 
That go deep. That make it special, real show of love.&quot; 

&quot;Aww...I suppose that&#39;s sweet, in a weird sort of way. Is that rope 
chafing you at all Akane?&quot; 

&quot;Nnnn. No! I just, nnnnnnnn, can&#39;t get free!!&quot; Replied Akane, still 
struggling. 

The Chinese girl now smiled while she walked calmly over the Akane, 
before gently rolling her into her back, and then straddling her as she 
sat down. 

Akane lay helpless now that the Amazon was making herself comfortable, 
sitting on the Tendo Girl&#39;s groin. 

&quot;Love Knot never meant to hurt. Just bind. Even if Akane pull very very 
hard, she never feel tension on rope. If perfect symbol of love, bind 
that not hurt.&quot; Uttered Shampoo softy, lightly stroking Akane&#39;s cheek as 
she spoke. 

&quot;Wow. How do you make a &#39;Love Knot&#39;?&quot; Quizzed Ukyo with genuine 
enthusiasm. &quot;Nope. Shampoo never say! It Amazon secret! Ukyo will only 
learn when she become Amazon. That the rules.&quot; Shampoo now brings her 
head closer to Akane&#39;s. 

&quot;Now....Shampoo pay back Akane for being mean to Shampoo! Whipping poor 
Shampoo on ass. It still a little sore.&quot; Whimpered the Amazon playfully. 

&quot;If you want I&#39;ll kiss it better. Just, please let me go!&quot; Came a 
panicky reply from Akane, who knew too well that Shampoo had something 
planned for her. 

&quot;Maybe later. But that not enough for Akane get free. Shampoo has 
decided, it special time for Akane. One thing only free Akane from Love 
Binds!&quot; 

&quot;W...what thing?&quot; 

&quot;Akane must surrender to Shampoo....&quot; 

&quot;Surrender? But you already have me tied up. You could do what ever you 
like now. I can&#39;t stop you.&quot; 

The Chinese Girl now giggled softly as she continued. &quot;Aww, that true. 
Shampoo could mate with Akane. &#39;Rape&#39; Akane. Do anything. But Shampoo 
wants Akane to surrender. Shampoo wants Akane to surrender all freedom 
and become Shampoo&#39;s Love Slave, under Amazon law.&quot; 

This caught both Akane and Ukyo off guard. 

&quot;Love Slave?!!&quot; Exclaimed Ukyo. &quot;What&#39;s that supposed to be?!&quot; 

&quot;Once Akane surrender freedom, Akane will belong to Shampoo. Shampoo 
already have Akane heart. Now Shampoo want body and ghost too! Akane 
forced to do all Shampoo commands....if they done with intent of love. 
It like, more than marriage, it eternal pledge of love submission.&quot; 
Recited Shampoo radiantly, her eyes sparkling with pride and faith in 
her people&#39;s ways. 

Akane on the other hand, wasn&#39;t as enthusiastic. 

&quot;That sounds very sweet Shampoo. You know I love you deeply, but... ..I 
like being free. With all the kidnappings I&#39;ve gone through over the 
past years, it&#39;s one of the major perks in my life, that I&#39;m free most 
of the time. Please don&#39;t take it the wrong way, but I don&#39;t want to be 
a slave.&quot; 

With a blink of her eyes, the sparkle of Shampoo&#39;s vision was suddenly 
replaced by stern dedication. 

&quot;Akane not understand. Akane become slave if she like of not. Akane will 
surrender.&quot; 

&quot;You can&#39;t make me Xain Pu!! You evil Amazon minx!!&quot; Replied Akane in 
mock defiance. &quot;You can rape me till I scream my last breath out but 
I&#39;ll never surrender to you! Never!&quot; 

&quot;Fine, foolish little Japanese girl...&quot; Said Shampoo, now taking the 
role of the &#39;villain&#39;. &quot;...there other ways to make Akane crack.&quot; 
Shampoo slides her fingers down to Akane&#39;s waist. 

&quot;Ever since first mate alone. Shampoo study Akane body. Shampoo know 
every little curve, every hair, every sensitive spot. Shampoo has 
learned something about Akane body.&quot; 

&quot;Oh....what?&quot; 

Shampoo gently brushes a finger near the Tendo Girl&#39;s navel, provoking a 
load giggle from her. 

&quot;Akane most ticklish on tummy!!&quot; 

Akane was in shock. Even she didn&#39;t know that. With no warning Shampoo 
began to tickle the girl relentlessly, causing her to belly-laugh 
out-load. With her arms bound behind her, and her legs neatly tied 
together, she couldn&#39;t even try to protect her exposed torso from 
Shampoo&#39;s &#39;Tickle Torture&#39;. 

&quot;HA HA HA HA!!! HEE HEE! No! Shampoo! Please stop!! HAA HA HA HA!!&quot; 
Pleaded Akane with tears of laughter in her eyes. 

Shampoo relented for now, and sat back. &quot;Akane ready to surrender?&quot; 

&quot;NO! I still won&#39;t surrender my freedom! I just want you to sto- HEE Hee 
hee HAAA HA HA HA!!&quot; 

Knowing the Akane wouldn&#39;t surrender, Shampoo continued anyway with a 
massive grin on her face. Nothing short of surrender would stop her. 

Ukyo just looked on, fairly amused by the antics of her lovers. 

================================================================ 

Nabiki was still down in the restaurant, summing up all of her work. 
Being the master of book-keeping that she was, everything balanced out 
nicely for her, and so with a final flick of her pen, she underlined the 
last total. She then stretched out with a loud yawn before relaxing into 
the soft seating of the booth, content with a job well done. 

&quot;That&#39;s the end of that..&quot; She muttered to herself before lazily 
flicking the book closed with one hand. A grin of smugness now found 
it&#39;s home on the Middle Tendo&#39;s face, Ukyo knew how great she was, her 
ego was boosted somewhat by that. 

That smug grin was wiped away seconds later, when the arrival of Konatsu 
takes her by surprise. He entered the room, still in a daze after seeing 
Ukyo naked, he wandered, zombie-like towards the serving counter, 
looking for something. 

&quot;Hey Konatsu....&quot; Called Nabiki, grabbing the ninja&#39;s attention. &quot;What 
the? Nabiki?&quot; Replied Konatsu, still a little dazed. The brunette girl 
gets up from her seat and then makes her way over to the customer side 
of the counter. 

&quot;You look a little out of sorts Konatsu. Are you ok?&quot; Quizzed Nabs, now 
that she could see the dopey expression on his face. Konatsu&#39;s attention 
was suddenly drawn to himself, when he realised this, so he shook his 
head violently, to snap out of it. 

&quot;What me? I&#39;m just, yea I&#39;m just.......yea.&quot; 

Konatsu&#39;s frantic response prompted a slight giggle from the Middle 
Tendo, who seem very amused by this. But while she giggled at this, 
Konatsu&#39;s eyes decided to move at their own accord, and to the ninja&#39;s 
horror, he found them fixed on the ample bust of his fellow employee as 
it heaved with each giggle. 

With Ukyo still fresh in his mind, his imagination decided to misbehave 
as well, and before her knew it, his mind imagined Nabiki&#39;s naked 
breasts under those coverings. Konatsu, incredibly embarrassed by this, 
now found himself having to cover his nose to prevent it from bleeding! 

By now Nabs had finished giggling, and could see the state the ninja was 
in, his eyes fixed on her chest. Oblivious to what he was thinking, she 
asked what was wrong. 

&quot;You ok, Konatsu?&quot; For some reason, she seemed to believe there was an 
innocent explanation to his ogling of her breasts. &quot;What the? Is there 
something on my shirt?&quot; She asked while she looked down only to find a 
small ink blob near one of the buttons. &quot;Tsk. I *knew* it! I always get 
ink on me when I do day-books.&quot; Nabs proceeds to rub the ink off. &quot;Not 
coming out. Oh well. I suppose it&#39;s my own fault. I get a little too 
excited when the figures balance out.&quot; 

The Tendo girl&#39;s ignorance to what Konatsu was up to, gave the ninja a 
much needed chance to recover his posture. 

&quot;So, emm, Nabiki....I thought you&#39;d be gone home by now.&quot; &quot;Huh? 
Oh....no. I stayed to do Ukyo&#39;s books for her-&quot; Nabiki places the book 
on the counter. &quot;-but it was an up hill struggle. It&#39;s like the girl is 
drawing a big manga instead of an accounts book.&quot; 

&quot;You think that is bad? She uses me a muse. You should see the drawings 
of me. Sometimes she draws me as a girl, and then gives me breasts about 
three times the size of my head!&quot; 

&quot;Really? Oh well. Looks like she&#39;s gunning for a job in AIC! Hmm...that 
company had a big turnover in the last quarter. Should check my shares 
portfolio....&quot; 

&quot;You only stayed to do her books?&quot; 

&quot;Yea. That, and to see if Akane was coming home...&quot; They then both hear 
Akane&#39;s laughter. &quot;But as you can see, that ain&#39;t happening tonight. I 
tell you, there&#39;s something wrong with that trio. Being lesbian is one 
thing, but I&#39;ve heard they spend most of their time naked, playing weird 
sex-games! I bet it&#39;s mostly because of that Queen of the Amazon up 
there!&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s a safe bet.&quot; Added Konatsu who now took a 2 cans of ice tea out 
of the counter fridge, and handed one to her. 

======================================================================= 

Akane was in fits of laughter. But now she had endured many minutes of 
blissful hell, with Shampoo lightly tickling her, all over her torso. 

It was a valiant fight, and Akane had held out as hard as she could in 
the slight hope that Shampoo would tire first, but it didn&#39;t happen. And 
so she gave up. 

&quot;HA ha ha ha! Hee hee hee! OK! OK! I GIVE UP! I surrender!!! Hee hee! ha 
ha HA!&quot; 

Shampoo stopped, herself and Ukyo couldn&#39;t believe their ears. Akane 
surrendering? &quot;A...Akane give up? Did Shampoo hear good?&quot; 

&quot;Yes....I surrender to you Shampoo. It was too much for me-&quot; Akane faces 
away from them, with a look of defeat on her face, that matched her 
voice. &quot;-I surrender. I&#39;ll be your Love Slave.&quot; 

The Amazon&#39;s eyes light up with excitement. &quot;Akane will be Love Slave?! 
Oh! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! But....does Akane know what that means?&quot; 

&quot;Yes....It&#39;s means that I&#39;m yours Shampoo. Body and soul, I&#39;m yours 
forever. You...you own me.&quot; 

That was enough for her. She sat up, and clasped her hands together in 
joy. Both Japanese girls could almost feel the ecstasy welling up inside 
the Amazon, who now seemed to tingle with happiness. 

Eventually, Shampoo managed to focus herself. She put her left hand over 
her heart and then put her right on Akane&#39;s. Then with a focused face, 
she closed her eyes, and began to whisper a prayer in Amazonian Chinese. 

Akane listened intensely that what Shampoo was say, but she couldn&#39;t 
understand it. It didn&#39;t matter, however, it sounded beautiful to her, 
and had an almost hypnotic effect. 

After about a minute, Shampoo finished her prayer and then knelt down to 
give Akane, a Kiss of Death. It was done. 

Shampoo now wore a massive grin on her face as she hugged her new slave 
tightly, before letting go so she could begin un-tying her. Akane let 
out a sigh of relief when she felt her legs move freely, and then aided 
Shampoo by sitting up so that she could free her arms. 

All the while, Ukyo watched as always, now a little flushed after seeing 
this. &quot;Aww...that was so cute......you...own Akane now?&quot; 

&quot;Yes-&quot; Replied Shampoo while she broke the Love Knot holding Akane&#39;s 
wrists. &quot;-Akane now must obey all commands Shampoo give. It like 
actually being slave! But...it not cruel like real slavery. It soft and 
kind and loving. Love Slavery is for Amazon, great expression of love, 
total and full.&quot; 

&quot;What does this mean for me?&quot; Whimpered Akane, now rubbing her freed 
wrists. 

&quot;For Akane. It mean life of following Shampoo orders of love. Akane mate 
when Shampoo ask. Akane kiss when Shampoo ask. Akane help Shampoo mate 
with Ukyo and Ranma. All nice things Akane like doing anyway. 
Also....emm....Shampoo gets to keep Akane in Love Binds whenever she 
feel like.&quot; 

&quot;Oh great.....a life of humiliation. What&#39;s new?&quot; Muttered Akane, 
prompting a giggle or two from Ukyo. 

&quot;Oh, it not all like that. Come to Shampoo-&quot; The Chinese Girl takes hold 
of her girlfriend and then lays her head on her warm lap. With a kind 
smiling face, Shampoo cradled Akane, stroking her hair lightly as she 
spoke. 

&quot;-there are good things about being Shampoo Love Slave. Now, for rest of 
life and forever, Shampoo must take care of Akane. It duty of Love 
Captor. Whenever Akane sick, or not feel well, Shampoo will nurse 
better. If Akane ever scared, Shampoo make it all good. If Akane ever 
lonely, Shampoo will be there. Akane never be alone. And all the time, 
Shampoo love and care, like mother to new baby. Shampoo wrap Akane in 
blanket of love, and never let go....&quot; 

=================================================================== 

The shadows outside. They moved. Three pairs of eyes, fixed on the 
restaurant. The time was near. 

=================================================================== 

Both Nabs and Konatsu were still at the counter, chatting away with 
their drinks. Neither of them could believe this. 

Konatsu was confident with this girl, how could this be? He could barely 
speak to Ukyo, let alone anyone else. 

Nabiki was talking to a &#39;nice guy&#39;? She didn&#39;t think they existed. 
Finally someone she could share opinions....and feelings with. 

&quot;Ok....Ok....I admit it. I do take pictures of him when he&#39;s a &#39;girl&#39;, 
for want of a better word. But I only do it because he makes a cute 
girl, and naked pictures of her are gold dust at the Furinkan porno 
rings.&quot; 

&quot;So you want to be a pornographer?&quot; 

&quot;No....No....No. I have too much self-respect for that. I even realise 
the value of a photo of little me in *my* birthday suit, but no. I only 
do this, because it&#39;s the most lucrative asset I can market right now. 
Hopefully when I get my Finance Degree, I can move on to bigger and 
better things.&quot; 

&quot;Oh? Like what?&quot; 

&quot;I dunno....CEO of Toyota, or Sony or one of the other big players.&quot; 

&quot;Wow. You&#39;re aiming high...&quot; 

&quot;You have to aim high in the cut-throat world of commerce. Otherwise I 
might end up as some secitary, and I have no interest in that-&quot; 

She is suddenly interrupted by noises outside the restaurant. 

&quot;-Hey? What? What was that outside?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll go check-&quot; Said Konatsu as he went for the door. 

=================================================================== 

Back in the bedroom, things had gone a little further with Akane and 
Shampoo. What had started as an innocent embrace, now turned to 
something much more. 

Somehow, Akane had managed to get into a position, where she could rest 
her head on the Amazon&#39;s bust. At first, that&#39;s all she had done but 
then, inexplicably, and through no will of her own, her mouth found it&#39;s 
way to Shampoo&#39;s nipple. 

And so, for several minutes, Ukyo and Shampoo watched in silent awe, as 
Akane nursed off the Amazon girl. 

Eventually, the Tendo girl noticed the fairly unusual situation she was 
in and so to her horror, she felt the hardened nipple of her girlfriend 
between her soft lips. She immediately recoiled. 

&quot;Oh goddess! What did I just do?!&quot; 

&quot;Akane, your were breastfeeding!-&quot; Chirped Ukyo from her bed. &quot;-it was 
so cute!&quot; 

Akane&#39;s eyes made their way up, to see that Shampoo was grinning from 
ear to ear, she clearly enjoyed that. 

&quot;Oh! This so embarrassing. Shampoo....I....I...almost thought you were 
my-&quot; 

&quot;Mommy?&quot; Butted in Shampoo her voice broken with emotion. 

&quot;Yea....is that a side-effect of Love Slavery?&quot; 

Shampoo immediately takes hold of Akane&#39;s head and cuddles her. 

&quot;Yes, it one of good things-&quot; The Chinese Girl releases Akane&#39;s head and 
then takes hold of her own left breast. &quot;-come Akane. Feed more from 
Shampoo. It feel good, yes?&quot; 

Akane&#39;s cheeks redden. &quot;Y...yea it does. But...it doesn&#39;t feel right to 
do this to you.&quot; 

&quot;What? It right! Shampoo like Akane go sucky suck on Shampoo breast it 
feel nice, Akane lips soft like new silk!&quot; 

&quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m about to do this on purpose.&quot; Uttered Akane in a 
soft whisper, before latching her lips onto Shampoo&#39;s breast again. 

&quot;Aww. That is soooo cute, sugers. You&#39;re like mother and daughter... 
...well...sorta...more like a pair of lovers playing with their bits, 
but this is too special to call it just that....(now I&#39;m wishing Akane 
was MY love slave. Oh well)&quot; 

=================================================================== 

Konatsu was out on the street, looking up and down it, trying to see 
what caused that noise himself and Nabiki heard. 

But was nothing to be seen. He gave up and went back in, locking the 
door after him. 

&quot;There&#39;s nothing out there.&quot; He said, a little confused. 

&quot;I&#39;m sure I heard *something*&quot; Reiterated Nabiki. &quot;Yes, so did I. Must 
have just been a cat or something.&quot; &quot;Yea. Maybe.&quot; Said Nabs while she 
stretched and yawned. 

&quot;You look tired Nabiki. Maybe you should go home for rest.&quot; 

&quot;Emm....I think I&#39;ll hang around for a while. I&#39;m kinda like this. 
Besides...with the three of them up there, butt naked and having hot 
lesbian sex....I sure I can get something good for the Furinkan market.&quot; 
Purred the Middle Tendo with a smirk on her face. 

&quot;-Besides, what&#39;s the harm in staying a little longer?&quot; 

=================================================================== 

Something moved in the darkness outside. It was getting closer. 

=================================================================== 

Akane suckled on Shampoo&#39;s breast, gently yet firmly. She had closed her 
eyes and was enjoying this, so much so that it nearly pacified her as 
she got into a soft rhythm between her lips and the Amazon&#39;s nipple. 

&quot;Look at her go-&quot; Commented Ukyo as she watched. &quot;-but she&#39;ll never get 
any milk out of there.&quot; 

&quot;(Shhhh)&quot; Whispered Shampoo. &quot;(-That not point. Watch.)&quot; Sure enough, 
soon after, Akane&#39;s unconscious head drooped away from her girlfriend&#39;s 
chest. 

The chef gasped out load in total disbelief. &quot;(Wow....that&#39;s amazing. It 
put her to sleep like a baby. But....she&#39;s a fully grown teenage girl. 
That shouldn&#39;t work.)&quot; 

Shampoo smiled a warm smile. &quot;(That the power of Love Slavery. For being 
Shampoo&#39;s little slave, Akane get to experience more love than Shampoo 
could normal give. Feed from Shampoo like that, it more deep, it more 
sensual, can put even hardest warrior to sleep like baby.)&quot; 

Shampoo takes hold of Akane&#39;s back and legs and then carries her limp, 
sleeping body over to the Coomicoomi, and then puts her in it, in a 
foetal position, before tucking her in tightly. 

&quot;(Akane now have most deep sleep ever in life-)&quot; Whispered the Chinese 
Girl softly into her Airen&#39;s ear. &quot;(-and most special dream ever.)&quot; 
Shampoo finished that with a soft kiss on her forehead, before raising 
to her feet. 

&quot;Aww. That was so sweet, sugar.&quot; 

&quot;It nothing-&quot; Commented Shampoo whilst she dusted off her hands. &quot;-it 
all in a day for Love Captor. Anyway, now that little Akane is off to 
sleepyland, Shampoo and her Airen-&quot; Shampoo faces the chef with a coy 
smile on her face. &quot;-can have fun fun, yes?&quot; 

&quot;Fun fun? Oh? Like what kind of fun fun sugar?&quot; Asked Ukyo, knowing all 
too well what she meant. 

The Amazon walked over to Ukyo, moving her hips seductively as she went. 
She towered over Ukyo, who was now lying on her back, and then pinned 
her down before mounting and straddling her older girlfriend. 

&quot;Shampoo take Ukyo.&quot; Purred the Chinese Girl whilst she cupped and 
groaped on of the chef&#39;s breasts. &quot;Shampoo not mate with Ukyo since time 
in forest.&quot; A coy grin was now worn by the Amazon girl before she pinned 
Ukyo&#39;s arms to the bed. &quot;Maybe Shampoo should make Ukyo Love Slave too?&quot; 
Ukyo was more than a little uneasy about that idea. &quot;Emm. No please 
Shampoo. I don&#39;t want to be a slave. Even a love-struck slave of feeling 
and emotion like Akane is. I don&#39;t fancy the idea of being bound at your 
whim. I just don&#39;t like bondage.&quot; 

&quot;Shampoo never take &#39;no&#39; as answer! Shampoo make Ukyo love slave. Maybe 
not today, maybe not tomorrow, but.....day sometime after tomorrow, 
yes?&quot; &quot;Even if you use Love Knots, even if you use rape-bondage, even if 
you tickle me on my most ticklish spot on the most ticklish day of my 
life with an Electrified Tickle Machine, using the most ticklish 
feathers from the legendary Tickle Bird of Kyushu........I wouldn&#39;t 
surrender to you Shampoo. I would fight you till I die from your 
delicious torture.&quot; 

Shampoo was taken a little back by this before returning to her usual 
smile. &quot;Oh. Shampoo forget. Ukyo have lot of fight in spirit. But 
Shampoo can break. Just need to plan. In meantime, Shampoo have other 
plans for Spatula Girl.&quot; 

&quot;Oh? Like what?&quot; Uttered Ukyo with a touch of embarrassment now that she 
could see the look of lust on Shampoo&#39;s face. 

&quot;Oh....little things-&quot; Said Shampoo with her smile, as she circled a 
nipple gently with her finger. &quot;-like, Shampoo always 
wanted....Chocolate Airen-&quot; The Amazon giggled devilishly while she lay 
over Ukyo, bringing her face closer to her. 

&quot;-Shampoo would love.....Ukyo Flavour.&quot; 

&quot;Me?-&quot; Mumbled Ukyo, her eyes widened in shock. &quot;-you want to cover me 
in chocolate?!&quot; Shampoo nodded in reply. 

&quot;But no....please don&#39;t do that to me. I&#39;ll have chocolate all over me. 
I&#39;ll be picking it out of my navel for weeks....&quot; 

&quot;But Shampoo really want Chocolate Ukyo!&quot; Demanded Shampoo while she 
squeezed them even closer together. 

&quot;Please Shampoo! Don&#39;t do it to me! Why not get Akane to do it. Your 
little slave. She can&#39;t say no, you own her!&quot; 

&quot;Hmm. Ukyo right. But Shampoo get that anyway. Shampoo could just use 
Akane to help tie Ukyo up, take close off and put chocolate on!&quot; 

Ukyo was a little frantic, she really didn&#39;t want this. 
&quot;Yea....but....but.....you haven&#39;t a clue how to make the chocolate 
paste.&quot; 

&quot;What? There is trick to it?&quot; 

&quot;Yes Shampoo. You need a paste that spreads well on skin, and since 
there is a lot for even two to lick up, it needs to be not that rich. I 
could make that paste Shampoo, if you spare me from a being a dessert! 
Come on, we both know that Akane is the sweetest little sugarball we 
have. I&#39;d love to lick chocolate off her cute little nipples.&quot; 

This gave Shampoo some food for thought. &quot;Hmm. Ukyo right. Akane is 
nice. Even nicer if she like that......Ok! It deal! Ukyo make paste, 
Shampoo order Akane into it.&quot; 

&quot;Wanna shake on it?&quot; &quot;No...Shampoo want to do something else...&quot; &quot;I 
thought you would...&quot; 

With no warning Ukyo took hold of Shampoo and flung her onto the bed 
covers before pinning her down. 

&quot;But this time *I&#39;m* taking charge!&quot; Shampoo was shocked, never before 
Ukyo been so forceful with her. &quot;Ukyo...Ukyo never-&quot; The chef gagged her 
with her finger. 

&quot;Shh. You&#39;re always the one who puts the effort into making love to us. 
Now it&#39;s my turn to do it to you. Ohh.....you make me so WET!&quot; 

&quot;U...Ukyo?! Shamp-&quot; She was silenced by a kiss. Ukyo did as she 
threatened and took charge, holding Shampoo firmly as she kissed her 
with the same strength that the Amazon expected of herself. 

=================================================================== 

Darkness. Akane floated naked in darkness. It felt like she was 
underwater, but she could breath as if it were air. 

This must be a dream. It was tranquil and warm where she was. She felt 
totally at peace. 

&quot;Wonderful.&quot; She thought to herself, only to here that thought echo 
around her. Thanks to that, she knew that this place was small. 

She reached out and touched on of the walls. It was fleshy, it felt like 
there was blood pumping through it. 

And then she could feel something attached to her body. Akane looked 
down and to her amazement, she saw an umbilical cord linked to her 
navel. She felt it, it seemed real. But how could it be, only the unborn 
could have these. 

She gasped when it all pieced together for her. Somehow, in this dream, 
she had returned to the womb. But...she didn&#39;t remember being inside her 
mother, how could this be possible, how could a naked teenage girl be 
hooked up to a womb like this. 

But then she could smell something in the waters. I scent, one she 
recognised. But from whom? All became clear, when she could hear a 
muffled voice above her. 

&quot;(Hee Hee Hee. Ukyo being so forceful! Shampoo so so surprised!)&quot; 

&quot;Shampoo?! I&#39;m in *your* womb?&quot; Akane looked down in disbelief. &quot;You 
really love me that much Shampoo? You love me enough to share here with 
me? Oh Shampoo. You really are too much for me.&quot; 

&quot;(No Ukyo! Let Shampoo kiss!)&quot; &quot;(Hey, try and stop me sugar! I don&#39;t 
need love slavery to force you to do things!)&quot; &quot;(Aiya! Let Shampoo arms 
go!)&quot; 

Akane began to giggle at this. &quot;Ukyo too? This must be happening how. A 
ghost dream, like our nightmare wedding.&quot; 

Akane floated around a bit, looking around. 

&quot;Hmm...only one way out, and knowing Shampoo, it&#39;s way too tight for me, 
baby-size or not. Oh well, better just sit back and relax. I&#39;m sure 
that&#39;s what she wanted. Damn, this Love Slavery is powerful stuff.&quot; 

The Tendo girl goes limp and lets herself settle in the centre of the 
womb. 

&quot;Mmmm. This is better than a sauna. I wonder if she&#39;s really feeding me 
through this cord.&quot; Mused the brunette girl while felt the umbilical 
yet. She couldn&#39;t help but feel something that was fused to her like 
that. 

&quot;How the hell do babies not start playing with this and break it? I 
can&#39;t keep my hands off it. Hmm...wonder if sharing your girlfriend&#39;s 
nervous system counts as sex?&quot; 

Akane went silent for a moment, thinking. &quot;Should stop talking to 
myself, I&#39;d look crazy if someone was watching this, or even reading 
about it. Hmm....still, I wonder....&quot; 

Akane looks up. &quot;Shampoo.....can you hear me? Shampoo? It&#39;s Akane.&quot; 

================================================================= 

&quot;I&#39;ve got you now you little minx! Finally bagged me an Amazon girl!&quot; 
Announced Ukyo triumphantly while she pinned down Shampoo&#39;s arms. 

&quot;No! The dishonour! Shampoo no captured! Shampoo n-&quot; Shampoo suddenly 
stopped mid-sentence, with a confused look on her face. 

&quot;Hey Shampoo, what&#39;s wrong? Did I hurt you Sugarpoo?&quot; 

It was not that, for Shampoo could hear Akane in her mind, which caused 
her to smile with immense joy. 

&quot;It worked!&quot; Screamed Shampoo before she looked down near her groin. 
&quot;(Nihao Akane! Awwww. So content in womb.)&quot; 

Ukyo more than a little confused with Shampoo&#39;s behaviour. &quot;Hey 
Shampoo....who are you talking to?&quot; 

&quot;It secret!&quot; Purred the Amazon in response. &quot;Ukyo no allowed know yet.&quot; 

&quot;Oh...ok then. But I honestly don&#39;t know what&#39;s so secret about talking 
to your belly button.&quot; 

================================================================= 

&quot;Shampoo....I love you so much. This place is so peaceful, I could just 
go to sleep here, for 1000 years.&quot; 

And with that Akane curled up into a foetal position, and slowly began 
to drift into sleep. 

================================================================= 

&quot;No! Please! Let Shampoo love Ukyo!&quot; Shampoo squirmed to get free, but 
to no avail. 

&quot;Shampoo, you&#39;re getting loved by me, end of story.&quot; 

Shampoo began to growl like a cat. &quot;If Ukyo rape Shampoo, Shampoo will 
get revenge. Just like Shampoo just did to Akane for tying Shampoo up on 
night we first mate.&quot; 

&quot;Well actually, I was the one who tied you, sugar.&quot; 

With that Shampoo suddenly flipped the pair around, so that she would be 
pinning Ukyo down, her eye&#39;s now focused on the chef. Ukyo could read 
then as clearly as a newspaper. The Amazon Girl was thinking about doing 
something to her. The sight of Akane helpless in love binds was still 
fresh in her mind, and knew all too well, that was the fate awaiting 
her. 

&quot;But....It was Akane&#39;s idea! She wanted you tied up. Hell, she actually 
wanted you hog-tied, but I objected and managed to argue her down to 
using the chair. It was the first fight we ever had sugar. You have to 
admit, the ordeal for you would have been worse for you if you were on 
the floor hog-tied. I&#39;m sure you couldn&#39;t of contained your bladder like 
you did.&quot; Pleaded Ukyo, with trickle of sweat running down her forehead. 

&quot;Hmm. True. Shampoo would be more sore. Also Ukyo bring Shampoo to 
toilet like she promise. Ok. No revenge......yet.&quot; 

&quot;Fine then-&quot; Replied Ukyo while she took the Amazon by surprise, 
flipping her back over again, pinning her down like before. 

&quot;AIYA! No again! Shampoo no live this shame two times in one night.&quot; 

&quot;Oh yea? Well it&#39;s gonna get worse!&quot; With that, Ukyo put both of 
Shampoo&#39;s wrists under one of her hands, and then used her free hand to 
go south of the Chinese girl&#39;s waist. Before she knew it, she had 
reached her soft vulva and had invaded it with some of her fingers. 

Shampoo lay helpless while Ukyo &#39;ravaged&#39; her. But this pleasure was not 
what she was used to. Never before was she the helpless one, she always 
wanted control in the bed, and now her beautiful Japanese girlfriend had 
enslaved her with little more than her hands and her curvatious torso. 

But Shampoo still had one weapon left. 

Whilst Ukyo looked down at her with a smile, Shampoo began to look back 
with doe eyes of sadness. 

&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t Shampoo! *That* won&#39;t work on me!&quot; 

Shampoo just widened her eyes even more, and tried her best to look even 
cuter in her sadness. 

&quot;Shampoo...I know you like it when I touch like this. It&#39;s not going to 
work.&quot; 

The Amazon girl went one step further and let a tear fall from her eye. 
That nearly put Ukyo off guard....nearly. 

&quot;Awwww. Don&#39;t do that Shampoo, it&#39;s so sad and cute. You cry all you 
like but I&#39;m not letting go you till I feel you orgasm.&quot; 

Shampoo was not impressed. &quot;*Humpf* No fair!&quot; 

Ukyo just smiled at her girlfriend&#39;s childish behaviour. &quot;Oh, come 
sugar. Just lie back and enjoy some love making.&quot; 

&quot;Shampoo could.....but look!&quot; Announced Shampoo while she looked up at a 
point on the ceiling. This distracted the chef, who looked over at the 
same spot. &quot;Huh? What&#39;s there?&quot; 

It was a ruse. Shampoo used this time to free one of her arms, and 
before Ukyo had a chance to react, the Amazon already had a few fingers 
inside her womanhood. 

&quot;Ooooooo! Shampoo!!!! You dirty little Amazon! The oldest trick in the 
book! Oooo! Goddess!-&quot; Shampoo had gone nuts with her hand used it to 
send Ukyo to heaven and back. 

&quot;-Ohh...mercy Shampoo! I&#39;m not doing it *that* hard to you! Ooooo!&quot; 
&quot;Ukyo not show Shampoo mercy!-&quot; Purred the Amazon as she used her other 
hand, now freed from Ukyo&#39;s aroused arm, to pull her down into an 
embrace. &quot;-Shampoo show no mercy. Ukyo free when she orgasm. That why 
Shampoo use little Ryu technique to make Ukyo hotter!&quot; Shampoo finished 
in fits of giggles. 

&quot;Oooo ooh! No fair Shampoo! I do it the old fashioned way, and you 
cheated you cute little cheater!&quot; Shampoo just replied with more 
giggling. &quot;Shampoo!! Ooooh! Please...what technique are you using?&quot; 

&quot;Hmmm...it Number 5 on Fire Kanji list.&quot; 

&quot;5...isn&#39;t that the one....where the...*phew* spot is below the clit?&quot; 

&quot;Yes? Why Ukyo know- OOOOOO!!! AIYA! U-U-UKYO!&quot; Ukyo had started feeling 
her the same way. 

&quot;If I&#39;m going down, you&#39;re coming too! Now kiss me you sexy little 
sugarball!&quot; 

&quot;Aiya! What Shampoo do for love!&quot; And with that, they began to kiss 
again while their bodies went into overdrive, racing each other to 
orgasm. 

=================================================================== 

Akane floated, not fully asleep in her dream, but subdued. 

Nearly asleep, she moaned and stired in the waters of Shampoo&#39;s womb, or 
at least what seemed to be it. 

She was nearly asleep, until she felt the waters shift violently around 
her. &quot;W...what the? What&#39;s going on? A womb tidal-wave?&quot; 

And then she could hear the noises of love from her girlfriends. 

&quot;Oh...no way! They&#39;re making love! Wow. I&#39;m in the middle of it all.&quot; 
She could nearly hear Ukyo&#39;s fingers below her. 

&quot;Hey Ukyo! Go easy! I&#39;M in here too!&quot; 

========================================== 

Suddenly Shampoo interrupted the kiss to giggle. 

&quot;Huh? Why are you laughing?&quot; Quizzed Ukyo. 

&quot;Oh, just something funny Shampoo hear. Forget, just go back to kiss, 
yes?&quot; 

&quot;Emm....ok.&quot; The kiss continued. 

=========================================== 

&quot;Geese, Ukyo hasn&#39;t clue does she?&quot; Commented the Tendo girl, knowing 
all too well that Ukyo couldn&#39;t hear. 

&quot;(akane)&quot; Came a whisper from the darkness. 

&quot;Huh? What was that?&quot; Akane could see nothing. 

&quot;(Akane)&quot; Repeated the whisper. But this time Akane recognised it. That 
same whisper, that same voice. She heard it before in the forest. 

&quot;Oh, no. NO! That can&#39;t be here! NOT HERE!&quot; 

&quot;(Akane....I....am.....here.)&quot; 

An impression in the darkness now appeared. It looked like the outline 
of a young woman. 

And around her ears.....two purple star-shaped lights shone. Although 
Akane couldn&#39;t fully make her out, she knew who this was. 

&quot;YOU?! The woman from the forest. That raped us?!! You...you can&#39;t be 
here! This is a sacred place inside Shampoo! Get out! GET OUT!!!&quot; 
Screamed Akane while she covered her privates in fear. 

&quot;(I will not, my little Akane. You are now mine.)&quot; 

&quot;No! I am not! Whatever you are. I belong to Shampoo. She is my owner, 
only her and my lovers. You have no right to even see my body! GET OUT! 
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT!!&quot; 

&quot;(But we are so close....)&quot; 

&quot;NO!!!!&quot; 

&quot;(Oh really? Then how is it that we are so linked?)&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; And then Akane could see to her horror, her umbilical cord now 
connected to the navel of this woman. 

&quot;OH NO!!!&quot; 

&quot;(Akane.....come to me. If we link now, it will be so much easier. I 
don&#39;t to see you suffer.)&quot; 

&quot;NO! NEVER!&quot; 

&quot;(Pity....It will happen anyway. You, Xain Pu, and Ukyo....will be mine 
soon enough.)&quot; 

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; 

&quot;(Even as I speak, my followers are attacking Okonomiyaki Ucchan&#39;s)&quot; 

&quot;WHAT?! OH NO! SHAMPOO!! HELP!!!&quot; 

&quot;(She cannot hear you, it pointless to fight me. Now....come closer.)&quot; 

And then to her horror, Akane could feeling herself drawing closer to 
the woman, who reeled her in using the umbilical cord. 

&quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!&quot; 

=================================================================== 

Konatsu and Nabiki were still downstairs, talking. 

&quot;But that doesn&#39;t make any sense. How can an economy work like that?&quot; 
The ninja scratched his head trying to understand Nabiki&#39;s 
fiscal-babble. 

&quot;Well you see....The stock-exchange has to be there.&quot; 

&quot;Yea but their not actually buying anything real....&quot; 

&quot;No....but-&quot; 

A loud knock on the door interrupted them. &quot;We&#39;re closed! Come back 
tomorrow!&quot; Yelled Konatsu towards the darkened doorway. 

A louder knock followed. 

&quot;Didn&#39;t you hear me? Great....&quot; He walks from behind the counter and 
over toward the door while Nabiki watched him with a muted expression on 
her face. 

&quot;I said we&#39;re closed! It&#39;s midnight! We won&#39;t-&quot; 

Then with a huge crash three dark figures bust through the front window 
and lined up in front of Konatsu. 

They wore tight ninja-robes that concealed their identity. Two of them 
were clearly girls of similar age and the last was a male who wore black 
narrow-framed sports glasses. 

They stood, poised to attack. 

================================================ 

Meanwhile, upstairs, Ukyo and Shampoo were trapped in the jaws of 
pleasure. 

Dripping with sweat, their breathing was now heavy, and their minds were 
filled with lust. They could not hear the noises below, only each other 
and their noises of love. 

----------------------------------------------- 

&quot;NOOOO! DON&#39;T TOUCH ME!!!&quot; Screamed Akane, now mere inches away from the 
intruder. 

&quot;(Give in Akane. Let me touch you. Oh, you have no idea of the pleasures 
I can show you.)&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t....I don&#39;t want anything you have.....just leave me alone...&quot; 
Whimpered Akane, now that the woman took hold and began to embrace her. 

&quot;(Don&#39;t be afraid. With me....you will forget your lovers. You will 
forget Xian Pu, forget Ukyo, forget......Ranma.)&quot; 

Every time she mentioned the word &#39;forget&#39; she inched her mouth closer 
to Akane&#39;s and was about to force a kiss on her. 

&quot;Forget? No....NO.........NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!&quot; 

----------------------------------------------- 

Akane woke with a jump. 

&quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! DON&#39;T DO THAT! Help Shampoo! Help U....ky....o...&quot; The 
Tendo girl collapsed into tears. 

Both Ukyo and Shampoo stopped what they were doing and looked over. 
&quot;Akane? Oh sugar, what&#39;s wrong?!&quot; 

&quot;Akane cry?!&quot; Shampoo pulled herself from Ukyo and leapt over to her 
distraught Airen. &quot;No cry Akane. Oh Akane, why cry?&quot; The Amazon&#39;s soft 
words and even softer grip did nothing to calm Akane. 

&quot;The...the....the woman....she&#39;s....she was....she was-&quot; Akane&#39;s 
whimpering only confused both her girlfriends, who now both held her 
tightly. 

================================================ 

&quot;I said, WHO ARE YOU?!!&quot; Threatened Konatsu. He was met with silence. 

&quot;You&#39;ll need help, I&#39;ll get the girls down here.&quot; Nabiki turns tail and 
begins to run for the kitchen, but before she could get there, the two 
female ninjas had leapt into action and pinned her to the wall. 

&quot;Hey! Get your hands off her!&quot; Then the remaining ninja advanced on him. 

Konatsu got ready and stood in an attack stance. &quot;You want some of me, 
coward? Why not show me your face?&quot; 

&quot;Konatsu be careful! Nnnn! You girls are younger than me, how the hell 
are you stronger?! Nnnnn!&quot; Spouted Nabs while she struggled with her 
captors. 

The ninja did very little, but extend his arm and hand out. &quot;What? Is 
that all you&#39;re going to do?&quot; 

Of coarse it wasn&#39;t, for seconds later Konatsu could feel the hairs on 
the back of his neck, stand on end. Some massive, invisible force was 
emanating from this ninja, and before Konatsu had a chance to even think 
about this, the enemy ninja acted. 

He attacked....with the legendary Ghost Weapon attack. 

Konatsu was thrown across the room and into a pile of collapsible 
tables, under which he was buried by an avalanche of foldable furniture. 

&quot;KONATSU!!!!!!&quot; Screamed out Nabiki in frightened terror, before she was 
gagged by the hand of one of the ninja girls. But she still looked over 
to where Konatsu was buried, terrified and upset about what had just 
happened to him. 

&quot;Deal with her, I will get the girls.&quot; Said the male ninja with a 
strangely familiar voice, before disappearing into the kitchen, and 
leaving the ninja girls to &#39;deal&#39; with a still struggling Nabiki. 

===================================================== 

Ukyo jumped up from her position beside a now subdued Akane. &quot;Hey, did 
you hear that?&quot; 

&quot;Hear? What Ukyo hear?&quot; Quizzed Shampoo. 

&quot;It sounded like Nabs screaming.&quot; 

&quot;What, but Shampoo-&quot; 

&quot;Shhh...&quot; Ukyo interrupted the Amazon, to listen. 

Then Shampoo could hear it. &quot;(Someone here.)&quot; Said the Chinese Girl, 
growling like a lioness. 

&quot;No one invades MY restaurant! I&#39;m gonna get them!&quot; 

Ukyo grabs her big spatula, and heads for the bedroom door. 

But it was too late...the ninja had gotten there first, and before Ukyo 
could react, she was out-cold and on the floor. He had used the Ghost 
Weapon to knock her out. 

&quot;UKYO!&quot; Screamed out Shampoo now that got on her feet. 

The ninja&#39;s gaze now moved to Shampoo and Akane and soon as the Amazon 
girl saw this, she spread her arms out and blocked his view of her 
airen. 

&quot;Ninja jerk not touch Akane! Shampoo die first!!&quot; 

The ninja was about to move forward, but as soon as he saw Shampoo&#39;s 
naked body, he stopped. He seemed mesmerised by what he saw for some 
reason. He had already just seen a naked Ukyo attacking him, and that 
didn&#39;t effect him. But there seemed to be a connection here. 

&quot;Enjoy view ninja....it last you ever have!&quot; She began to advance on 
him, and as soon as she did, he tried to use his Ghost Weapon. 

Shampoo was shocked. &quot;Ghost Weapon?! But...but no-one able use it but 
Shampoo!&quot; 

He didn&#39;t say anything, he just stepped up the intensity. 

&quot;NO! Ninja not win! Ninja not touch Akane! Not touch Ukyo! Shampoo fight 
you. Shampoo use Ghost Weapon too.&quot; 

She did as she threatened and summed up all her energies and soul into 
her first ever controlled attempt at this ancient Amazon battle 
technique. 

A mammoth battle of wills ensued. Shampoo and the Ninja fought each 
other pressing the force of their Ghost Weapons together, pushing for a 
victor. But it wasn&#39;t easy for the Amazon girl. She had only one or two 
weeks practice in this technique, while this Ninja, seemed to be quite 
accomplished. 

&quot;NO!...No! Shampoo can&#39;t let win!&quot; Whimpered the Chinese girl as her 
energies began to ebb away. 

But unfortunately that&#39;s what happened. While the last of her soul 
drained from her, she turned her head to look on a half-conscious Akane. 

&quot;(Akane....Shampoo so sorry, Shampoo so-)&quot; That whisper was her last 
breath, before she passed out and fell a short distance from her 
girlfriend. 

Akane eased her eyes open. She could barely see him, but she knew what 
he was. The woman, she controlled him, somehow. But it didn&#39;t matter if 
she had seen him or not. 

He used the weapon on her, and everything went dark.
