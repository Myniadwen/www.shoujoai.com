<h1>Arisugawa's Locket (part 2 of 88)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/locket-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Rei Ayamani was totally plastered, swaying back and forth up on the 
karaoke stage singing rather off key but with a lot of enthusiasm. 
Misato, Maya Ibuki, Asuka Langley and Ritsuko were all sitting at 
their table and looking on with a great deal of amusement.

&quot;I&#39;m surprised only two beers would do that to her,&quot; Ritsuko said to 
Misato quietly, so that the girls couldn&#39;t hear them.

&quot;Maybe she&#39;s never drank before?&quot; Misato answered her with a shrug, 
before taking another long drink of her can of beer.

Asuka squirmed a bit uncomfortably in her seat as Rei looked at her 
intensely. She&#39;d been doing it all through the song, but now she 
seemed to put it up a notch.

&quot;You are all I long for, all I worship, and adore,&quot; Rei sang, smiling 
warmly at Asuka, who only sweatdropped a bit.

Juri smiled a bit, noticing the light on over the karaoke room door. 
It had been occupied pretty much constantly all night. &#39;To each their 
own, I guess,&quot; Juri thought to herself ruefully, &#39;but it looks like 
Nabiki was right about it.&#39;

She smiled, making her way through the crowd, greeting the newcomers 
and welcoming some of her old friends. Utena and Anthy looked like a 
fairytale couple, dancing together to the slow tunes. The pink hair 
was a bit shorter, and the darker girl seemed more confident, somehow, 
but they still fit together beautifully.

&quot;Miss Juri?&quot; a pleasant voice inquired behind her. She turned to see a 
smiling Ayeka standing right behind her. &quot;I hope things are going well 
for your opening night,&quot; the purple haired girl said with real 
sincerity.

&quot;Pretty good, Princess,&quot; Juri said with a nod. She looked towards the 
bar with a small smile as Ryouko poured drinks with her typical style, 
&quot;Your girlfriend&#39;s being kept pretty busy, but I bet she&#39;d like a 
visit.&quot;

Ayeka blushed brightly at that, following Juri&#39;s gaze with her own 
violet eyes. &quot;You might be right,&quot; she conceded, and began to make her 
way through the teeming crowds to the bar. Ryouko saw her coming and 
stopped pouring the drinks to sweep the startled girl into a fierce 
kiss as the crowd cheered it&#39;s approval.

Juri looked around the bar hopefully, but she didn&#39;t see the purple 
haired girl she was looking for. Not that she was really expecting the 
married Shiori to come, but still.

While she was looking around, she noticed something odd at the dining 
tables and made her way over to the table full of young women there. 
She put her hand on a red head&#39;s arm as she said to her coldly, 
&quot;Technically, I shouldn&#39;t let you in here, Ranma.&quot;

Ranma tried to look as innocent as possible even as Akane, Shampoo and 
Ukyo looked on with wide smiles. &quot;She is a girl who loves other 
girls,&quot; Akane pointed out to Juri reasonably, fighting to hold back 
her laughter.

&quot;Half the time,&quot; Juri said dryly, &quot;the other half she&#39;s a boy who 
loves girls.&quot; Everybody gave her puppydog eyes, and she relented, &quot;OK, 
you can stay.&quot; They all cheered up until she added, &quot;No trouble 
tonight, though. If you do, out you go.&quot;

&quot;Hey, I never start trouble,&quot; Ranma protested. Juri rolled her eyes at 
that, even as Shampoo and Ukyo snickered softly.

Hyatt took the nearby table&#39;s order, then she turned a odd shade of 
blue and promptly fell right over. She stayed on the floor and then 
snake crawled her way over to the kitchen even as Juri watched, 
sweatdropping. Looking a bit worried she quickly flagged down May to 
ask her, &quot;Does she always do that?&quot;

Cyberdoll May nodded, adding &quot;Strangely, she gets her orders in faster 
and the meals all come back perfectly well.&quot; She shrugged eloquently.

Juri nodded a bit dubiously in return. &quot;Could you keep an eye on her 
for me?&quot; Juri asked her quietly, watching Hyatt weave through the 
dancing figures without disturbing a single one. It was almost eerie 
to watch.

&quot;Yes, Ms. Arisugawa!&quot; May said, standing at attention.

Juri winced a little at that. &quot;Just calling me Juri would be perfectly 
fine,&quot; she said with a sigh. She looked at the expression of hurt 
incomprehension on May&#39;s pretty face and just decided to leave to 
alone.

&quot;Hey, Juri!&quot; she heard from near the main entrance. She looked up to 
see Haruka, Michiru and a third girl she didn&#39;t recognize come in. She 
went over to meet them and Haruka pulled her into a sudden hug, 
pounding her back.

&quot;Hey, I&#39;d like to use that back later,&quot; Juri grumbled under her 
breath, even as Haruka let her go with a soft laugh.

&quot;We haven&#39;t seen you in months,&quot; Michiru scolded her gently. She 
looked around the bar admiringly, &quot;I guess this has been what&#39;s kept 
you so busy.&quot;

&quot;Rebuilding this old club into what I wanted it to be,&quot; Juri nodded 
her agreement. She looked at the blue hared girl standing beside them 
and felt her stomach suddenly drop. The girl almost looked like a 
female Miki!

&quot;Down, girl,&quot; Haruka whispered to Juri, &quot;I think she&#39;s taken.&quot; More 
loudly she continued, &quot;Asisugawa Juri, I&#39;d like to introduce our 
friend, Mizuno Ami.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you Ami,&quot; Juri said charmingly as she shook Ami&#39;s hand 
gently. &quot;Is this your first time in a club like this?&quot;

Ami blushed, &quot;Very nice to meet you.&quot; She looked up at Juri to ask, 
&quot;Is it that obvious that I&#39;m new at this?&quot;

Juri smiled, &quot;No, it&#39;s just that you&#39;re so good looking that I&#39;m 
certain that I would have remembered you if I saw you before.&quot; Ami 
blushed at the compliment, even as Haruka not so discreetly elbowed 
her in the side. &quot;Ooof!&quot;

&quot;Michiru, could you and Ami go get us some drinks, please?&quot; Haruka 
asked even as she communicated with her girlfriend non-verbally with 
her eyes. Once she and Ami were safely gone, Haruka glared at Juri.

&quot;I was a bad girl, huh?&quot; Juri said with a little smile.

Haruka looked serious as she said quietly, &quot;Ami has the whole 
unrequited love thing going on with a friend right now.&quot; With some 
irritation she added, &quot;She does not need a much more experienced girl 
loving and then leaving her!&quot;

&quot;Point taken,&quot; Juri said, sounding a little hurt. &quot;Do you really think 
I&#39;d be that cruel to her?&quot; she asked with a frown.

Haruka smiled suddenly as she drawled, &quot;Either that or you&#39;d end up 
falling in love with her. Personally, I&#39;m not sure which would be 
worse!&quot; Juri punched her in the shoulder, making Haruka loudly exclaim 
&quot;Ouch!&quot;
