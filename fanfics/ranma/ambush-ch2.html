<h1>Ambush 1/2 (part 2 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/koalakiller.html">KoalaKiller</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/ambush-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>One could say that anything is possible when you whisper the name 
Nerima.  Indeed, this ward of Tokyo has been known for many strange and 
odd things.  In one day it could be quiet, peaceful even, but then in a 
flash of thunder the next moment you have high-powered Martial Artists 
ripping it apart.  Other times you could be walking down a path minding 
your own business whistling a tune, then suddenly a wall would explode 
besides you, showering you with rocks and before you know it you have 
some mad Prince out to kidnap and marry you while not caring what 
gender you are.

Thankfully these things only happen to a special select few and to only 
a couple of locations scattered around Nerima.  One of these locations 
is quite famous, or infamous, depending who you ask.  This place of 
chaos is mainly considered the focus of the problems, though this 
mayhem couldn&#39;t happen without a few key players.

The Tendou Dojo is this place, as you would have guessed.  Though there 
are others, they don&#39;t draw near enough chaotic events as the patched 
up Dojo.

With it being a weekend, a Sunday in fact, you would think there would 
be something stirring, something that just would love to screw up Ranma 
Saotome&#39;s life just a little bit more.  But for whatever reason, the 
extended Tendou Family was enjoying the so far quite day, now nearing 
lunch as Akane Tendou entered the Kitchen from the backyard.

&quot;Man, you would think that baka would seal his rude mouth after all the 
beatings I&#39;ve given him.&quot; Grumbled the short-haired, short-tempered 
girl.

Nabiki, sitting at the table looking over some notes, sipped at her tea 
before replying, &quot;Well sis, he was raised by a man who had no idea of 
how to look after children, so you can&#39;t really blame Ranma for his 
mouth.&quot; Nabiki smirked. &quot;So maybe giving him a break once a while 
wouldn&#39;t hurt, huh?&quot; she saw her baby sister growl at that comment.

&quot;Give him a break? HA, I&#39;ll give him a break if he pushes me too far.&quot; 
Walking over to the sink, Akane poured herself a drink as she directed 
a question to the silent, though busy Kasumi.

&quot;Hey Kasumi-chan, is the furo ready? I&#39;m beat from by day&#39;s workout and 
need to soak for a bit before lunch.&quot;

&quot;I would&#39;ve thought you would need a cooling down after Ranma-kun 
warmed you up.&quot; Nabiki noted, still smirking as she added numbers up.

&quot;Oh be quite, I need to relax.&quot;

Turning towards her youngest sister, Kasumi gave her trademark smile, 
saying, &quot;Why yes, I got it ready after seeing you do your weekend 
workout.&quot;

&quot;Thanks big sister,&quot; said Akane, as she left the Kitchen, &quot;at least I 
don&#39;t have to take any crap from you.&quot;

Nabiki only chuckled lightly, as she looked down at a very recent 
account and wondered how much she would get out of her latest client.

Meanwhile, Akane had gone up to her room to collect some clean clothes. 
So once she had selected something to her liking, the young Tendou heir 
walked out of her room still dressed in her gi and went down to the 
prepared furo.

As she entered the outer room to change out of her clothes, her mind 
once more wandered back to the events of Friday night and what she had 
shared with Shampoo.

That sunny Saturday morning she had briefly wondered if the whole thing 
had been a big wet dream.  But once waking up, shaking off the 
sleepiness she had realized she had indeed, had an intimate encounter 
with the purple-haired Amazon.

She was still confused about why Shampoo had acted the way she had, 
with their past history and all.  But right now she didn&#39;t really care 
why the girl decided to seduce her, the experience itself was one Akane 
wouldn&#39;t forget and she had even secretly hoped that some time in the 
future the bouncy piece of fur would try something similar.

She was suddenly brought out of her thoughts as she heard faint noises 
from the furo.  So dropping everything but her birthday suit, she 
entered the steamy room to see that it was empty.

&quot;Strange, I thought I heard something in here.&quot; She looked around, 
hoping to maybe see her P-chan had found his way home, but all she did 
find in the end was a towel laid on the floor.

&quot;Huh? What&#39;s that doing here?&quot; Akane scratched her head in confusion, 
knowing Kasumi wouldn&#39;t leave something like that laying around.  The 
towel itself was a deep purple in color and had a picture printed on 
it.

&quot;Nihao Kitty?&quot; Blinking, she bent over to examine the fluffy item, 
wandering if the towel was a custom made item from China though 
confused in why it was doing in front of their furo.

&quot;Hiyaa, Akane give Shampoo too, too nice view.&quot; A voice came from 
behind, startling Akane as she had recognized it instantly 

But as she had straighten up, a pair of powerful slim arms circled her 
body, pinning her own arms to her body while feeling a pair of large 
breasts press up against her back.  A pair of breasts that she had 
became somewhat familiar with two nights back and as she turned her 
head she found lips from her capture brushing against hers briefly 
before hearing.

&quot;Akane always leave self open,&quot; purred the Amazon, eyes half closed, 
&quot;and Shampoo think maybe take advantage with Airen playing elsewhere.&quot;

&quot;Sh-sh-sh...&quot; shaking her head a bit to clear the now rushing emotions, 
Akane stuttered out, &quot;what are you doing here, at this time of day!?!&quot;

&quot;Hmmm, Akane no like?&quot; the girl cutely pouted in a teasing tone, &quot;would 
think she no mind seeing Shampoo and maybe having fun again.&quot;

&quot;No, no...but we-&quot; she was cut off as she soon gasped in pleasure as she
felt skilful fingers stroke her lower lips.  It seemed that Shampoo had 
moved one of her hands and had decided Akane needed some attention 
between the legs.

&quot;Hmmm, Akane very sweet but Shampoo no mind,&quot; the girl&#39;s hand moved up 
to Akane&#39;s mouth, forcing the short-haired teen to taste her own 
juices.

&quot;You like, Shampoo think Akane need some attention down there, yes?&quot;

&quot;Ahh...&quot; Akane could only mutter out as she tasted her body&#39;s juice, 
while she felt Shampoo&#39;s other hand start to tease her hardening 
nipple.

&quot;Yes, Shampoo think it good time to have fun.&quot; Murmured the Amazon as 
she first lowed the pair to their knees while continuing her treatment. 
One hand was on Akane&#39;s breast while the other hand stroking Akane&#39;s 
inter-thigh.

&quot;Oooohh...&quot; the Tendou girl was started to find herself getting into 
the act once more as she felt Shampoo&#39;s teasing fingers come closer to 
her wetting sex.

&quot;Mmmm, good yes?&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah.&quot; Shampoo lightly chuckled, thinking that Akane was like putty 
in her hands.

Shampoo soon had slowly moved Akane around so the girl would be sitting 
on the towel, her back against the furo while the Amazon&#39;s hands 
continued their pleasuring work.

&quot;Mmmm, I really shouldn&#39;t be letting you do this...&quot; mumbled Akane, 
enjoying too much the way Shampoo was now kneading both of her breasts.

&quot;Shampoo think you no care,&quot; the purple-haired Amazon said, now 
kneeling in-between the other girl&#39;s wide spread legs.  The Chinese 
girl then leaned her head forward and started to kiss around the neck, 
using her tongue to leave wet trail marks.

&quot;And...mmmm...if I didn&#39;t want you doing this to me...?&quot;

&quot;Then Shampoo probably get hit by too, too horny violent-girl, yes?&quot;

Akane only grunted at that, as she felt Shampoo&#39;s lips move up to her 
ear and thought the girl was trying to play chew toy with the lob.

&quot;Well...if you want meee...!&quot; she squeaked out as Shampoo pinched both 
of her nipples pretty hard at the same time, &quot;...you should just ask.&quot; 
She breathed out as Shampoo then started to trail a hand down her body.

&quot;Shampoo was never good at asking, Great-grandmother always say.&quot;

Ignoring that, Akane decided to become active in this little session of 
yuri action and used both of her hands to grasp those hanging perky 
breasts before her.

&quot;Mmmmm, that nice,&quot; purred Shampoo as her head moved around to briefly 
make eye contact with Akane then started to play tongue tag inside of 
the other girl&#39;s mouth.

The moaning coming from Akane soon picked up as Shampoo&#39;s hand finally 
reached the dripping honey pot.  With Akane spread open nicely for 
Shampoo to do some serious deep finger fucking, the Amazon slipped one 
digit in while making sure she took her time entering all the way in.

&quot;Mmmmmm...&quot; moaned Akane, started to move her hips as Shampoo thrust 
her fingers into her sex, adding another one whenever she wanted till 
the girl had three pumping Akane in a furious pace.

The two young women continued these actions, Shampoo pressing Akane 
against the furo while they kissed fiercely.  The Amazon used her long 
digits to bring her lover close to orgasm while she enjoyed her breasts 
being played with by the withering girl.

It wasn&#39;t long for Akane to start feeling herself shuddering in a 
burning orgasm.  Her body shook as her inner walls clinched onto the 
Amazon&#39;s fingers.

Shampoo&#39;s free hand briefly played with Akane&#39;s short hair, as she 
watched the orgasm run its course.  She herself was in need of her own 
release but could wait till Akane had re-gathered her breath.

Shaking her head to clear it, the Tendou girl soon focused on the 
kneeling Amazon before her and softly said.

&quot;Enjoyed yourself there, I&#39;m guessing.&quot;

Shampoo only lightly laughed as she stroked Akane&#39;s cheek, &quot;Shampoo 
enjoy view you give, though think its Akane turn to please.&quot;

The short-haired girl raised an eyebrow at that and said, &quot;Oh? Is that 
the only reason you do this now, you can&#39;t get yourself off these 
days?&quot;

The Amazon snorted at that, as she tapped Akane&#39;s noise playfully, &quot;You 
wish, Shampoo no need other but this is more fun with oth-&quot; she then 
suddenly stopped her sentence then to Akane&#39;s surprise leaped to her 
feet and lunged through the open window.

&quot;Huh, wha?&quot;

&quot;Akane? You in there?&quot; came the voice of Kasumi.

Eyes widening in shook, the girl quickly moved.  She only had enough 
time to get into the furo before the door to the room opened partly as 
Kasumi poked her head in.

&quot;Er, no Kasumi, just not finished yet!&quot; She blurted out, trying to 
control her racing heart.

&quot;Oh, ok then, but...&quot; The older girl looked down at the ruffled towel 
on the floor, &quot;where did that come from? Is it yours Akane-chan?&quot;

Quickly nodding, Akane made up, &quot;yes I found it and thought it was cute 
and so...&quot; she shrugged her shoulders, thanking that her sister wasn&#39;t 
good at seeing through lies.

&quot;Ok then, but don&#39;t stay in too much longer, lunch will be ready in 
five or so minutes.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I&#39;ll be down shortly.&quot;

Nodding to that, Kasumi shut the door and seem to leave.

Once a minute had gone by, the girl jumped out of the furo and ran to 
the window.  Looking out she wondered where Shampoo went, seeing as she 
was wearing nothing(though people might think that&#39;s normal thing :)).

It wasn&#39;t till Akane heard a meow from the house next door that she 
finally spotted Shampoo, or Neko-Shampoo.  The Tendou girl briefly 
though how did she find cold water but shrugged and eyed the 
pinkish-white cat.

It seemed to wave a paw at her, and bounded off.

&quot;Well, that was close.&quot; Muttered Akane, as she turned back and looked 
down at the towel left behind.

&quot;I better keep it till she comes back to claim it.&quot;

But right now her mind was spinning as she thought back on this newest 
encounter with Shampoo and thought again what was up with the girl.  
Though she didn&#39;t mind the sex right now, this time they nearly got 
caught by Kasumi of all people.

Shaking the blush away, Akane picked up the purple towel and dried 
herself.  Well, she thought, things here readily taking a turn forwards 
something weird but I wonder, will Shampoo ambush me again? And will it 
be just as good...?

As the girl left the room, the faint sounds of &#39;Hey that&#39;s my food old 
man&#39; and &#39;Wake up boy, you&#39;ll too slow!&#39;.

Oh well, better get down there and see what food is left.


* * * *


Three days later...

&quot;See you tomorrow, Akane-chan!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll ring you tonight, Sayuri.&quot;

Akane waved to her departing friends as they had just finished getting 
dressed from a long session of fitness and exercises.

It was the end of the last period as the short-haired girl minutes 
later exited the shower room, drying herself with a familiar purple 
towel.  As usual the coach had her do extra stuff to help keep their 
star soccer player in shape.  Her coach always made her run a little 
bit longer, push a little bit harder and generally put her body through 
the paces.

So by this time these days when she had finished her warm-downs, she 
was the last to enter the locker rooms to shower and change.  Though 
she didn&#39;t mind mostly at the extra attention her Teacher gave her, 
sometimes she hated having to leave school a bit later then normal.  
Ranma at times would wait around, saying he had nothing to do so he 
thought no harm in waiting for her to dress and stuff.

Akane snorted at that, as she walked slowly to her locker while flexing 
her sore muscles.  She thought these days Ranma was way too 
overprotective of her, just because she had gotten herself in a few too 
many situations that in the end was really Ranma&#39;s fault.

Stretching her back briefly, Akane&#39;s mind wandered over to the other 
person in her life who had decided she wanted to spend time with her 
for reasons unknown. 

Shampoo&#39;s &#39;antics&#39; as she called them confused her greatly.  The Amazon 
had twice now had come from no-where and for better of lack of words, 
screwed her silly.  It was true she enjoyed the experience, and heck, 
for someone like her who didn&#39;t mind a little T&amp;A, and she felt the 
frustrations of life not bothering her as much.
 
But seriously, if Shampoo wanted sex that badly and since she had 
learned of her little secret that only Nabiki knew about, couldn&#39;t she 
had approached her normally?  Well ok girls having sex with other girls 
wasn&#39;t really normal, but still, ambushing her like she had been was 
going to get her in trouble she could feel.  Having Kasumi, sweet 
loveable Kasumi nearly catch her in the act gave her the shivers and if 
this new secret of hers got out well who knows what would happen.

And if Cologne didn&#39;t approve...

She shook her head to clear the muddled thoughts and reached to open 
her locker...

&quot;Tsk, tsk, Akane lover you really should pay attention to 
surroundings.&quot;

&quot;Wha! Sh-&quot; Akane was cut off as she was suddenly pressed hard against 
the cool metal of the locker door.

&quot;Shampoo was thinking you might have seen her,&quot; the Amazon noted, as 
she pressed her naked form up against Akane&#39;s bare back, &quot;but you look 
too, too distracted and so thought maybe pervert-girl need something to 
take mind off whatever she thinking, yes?&quot;

Once Akane recovered herself from the surprise &#39;attack&#39;, she turned her 
head and muttered out.

&quot;Hello to you too, Shampoo, I hope you don&#39;t try these new greetings of 
yours on the street.&quot;

Shamooo&#39;s hands had griped Akane&#39;s shoulders currently, rubbing the 
muscles there while she heard the other girl&#39;s comment.

&quot;Ayiaah, Shampoo never thought of doing that,&quot; the Amazon gave off a 
thought purr as Akane&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;let Shampoo get back to you on 
that, and maybe find out how to have fun on street without people 
noticing.&quot;

&quot;Wha? Don&#39;t you dare-&quot; she was once more cut off as one of Shampoo&#39;s 
hands cover her mouth.

&quot;No taking, yes?&quot; The stronger girl chimed, &quot;Shampoo today went out and 
saw something that look good in Akane, so bought it and wanted to show 
you.&quot;

&quot;Mmmm?&quot; Blinked Akane, wondering where this was leading to.

Smiling, Shampoo&#39;s other hand seem to disappear into her long mane of 
purple hair while continuing to use her body to trap Akane.  Some 
moments later, that hand reappeared and the short-haired girl suddenly 
found something weird brushing her hand so in reflex grasped whatever 
it was.

&quot;You like? Shampoo is curious on these things called dildo.  And 
thought it be interesting to use on other girl.&quot;

Akane was shocked, as her hand wrapped around the silicone-based 
device.  Her mind roughly calculated both the thickness and length 
before Shampoo pulled it away.

&quot;Mmmm!!&quot; Akane tried to talk, but Shampoo kept her hand there while 
the other moved downwards between her legs.

&quot;If Akane really no want, then bite Shampoo hand,&quot; whispered the 
purple-haired girl into Akane&#39;s ear, &quot;if not, then Shampoo plug up 
pervert-girl&#39;s sweet, sweet hole.&quot;

Akane had been prepared to just do that, bite into the soft tissue of 
the hand but halted as she felt something brush against her lower lips.

That tease, thought Akane, as she lightly moaned at the sensations that 
little bit of contact gave her.  It seemed that the Amazon had done her 
homework and knew how to get a reaction.

Deciding in letting that monster of a dildo in was probably be a better 
idea then continue to resist Shampoo&#39;s advances.  Though Akane thought, 
when the time comes I&#39;ll show her...

As Shampoo began to move the dildo away again from her wetting sex, 
Akane used her semi-free hand to halt the device and push it back, 
making the Amazon purr in delight.

&quot;Ah, Shampoo thought Akane not what to miss taking in too, too big 
member.&quot;

As Akane&#39;s hand dropped to her side as it started to rub Shampoo&#39;s 
thigh  The Amazon started to part the wet lips with the dildo while her 
other hand teased the side of Akane&#39;s breast.   Also, the purple-haired 
girl started to use her own breasts, rubbing them on Akane&#39;s back in a 
slow sensual motion.

This scene kept on going, as Akane&#39;s forehead leaned on the locker door 
while she felt her tunnel being filled up by the dildo that Shampoo had 
seemly bought.

Shampoo smirked as she heard the moans coming from the other girl, as 
she started to thrust in and out of Akane&#39;s hole.  With each entrance 
she was able to thrust a bit more deeper, making the girl moan a little 
bit loader.  It was lucky that she had made sure that no one would 
disturb them or the questions that would come would be most 
embarrassing for both of them.

By now Akane&#39;s hips were trying to meet the intruding object.  She 
could feel herself building up to a large orgasm, panting and moaning 
as Shampoo work her over good.

&quot;Oooohhh yes, there, there...&quot; the short-haired girl moaned out, 
&quot;nearly there...yes....oh yeeSSS!&quot;

Shampoo felt the other girl start to shake, no doubt having a lovely 
orgasm.  Shampoo made sure to have the dildo pushed in as far as 
possible as Akane&#39;s inner walls clinched onto the fake member.

Taking in breaths, Akane finally came down from her orgasmic high as 
Shampoo rested her chin on the girl&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;See? Shampoo do good job, so Akane have nothing to complain, yes?&quot; 
Their cheeks touched as Akane turned her head as she thought over that 
comment.

&quot;Maybe...&quot; she mumbled out, &quot;but why...?&quot;

Shampoo continued to hold their position as she thought over that.  Why 
indeed, she thought, but answered with a question.

&quot;Why Akane care? Shampoo know you like having fun with girls, so why 
ask?&quot;

&quot;Because!&quot; she growled, wishing she could move, &quot;this ain&#39;t like you!  
We&#39;re not suppose to be doing THIS kind of thing together, don&#39;t you 
hate me?&quot;

&quot;Hmmmm,&quot; Shampoo lightly rubbed Akane&#39;s sides, while Akane noted that 
the dildo had disappeared from the Amazon&#39;s hand, &quot;Maybe not use that 
strong of word, but yes in past no like you, always in way of Shampoo&#39;s 
quest.&quot;

&quot;So why?&quot;

Before she could give an answer or even dodge the question, a voice 
from the exit startled them both.

&quot;Well, well, I&#39;m thinking it was a good idea to come get you instead of 
Ranma.&quot; Nabiki casually noted, as she leaned on the wall eyeing the two 
naked girls with a smirk painted on her features.

&quot;NABIKI!&quot; Shampoo was so surprised that Nabiki had avoided her senses 
that Akane was able to break free and jump back.

&quot;Oh come on now, sis, don&#39;t need to be shy around me since we are all 
girls here after all.&quot;

&quot;Aiyaa...&quot; The Amazon scratched her head, &quot;how much Sneaky-girl see?&quot; 
Nabiki eyed the Amazon carefully before replying.

&quot;Only the post match results, nothing that would get me hot and 
bothered.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot;

Akane by now had pulled herself together and glared at her sister.

&quot;What are you doing here? I thought you had your &#39;clients&#39; to seek 
out.&quot;

&quot;Indeed I did, but then I saw Ranma and remembered PE was your last 
period.&quot; Nabiki casually looked the room over before noting, &quot;It&#39;s a 
good thing I did come too, since I doubt Saotome would find those 
positions I found you in amusing.&quot;

Akane blushed at that, but still frowned at her sister.

&quot;Anyways, you two better get dressed since I think Ranma is getting 
restless and it won&#39;t be too long till he comes looking for you...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot;

&quot;Anyways, I&#39;ll see you two outside at the front gate.&quot;

As Nabiki left, Shampoo moved over to her hidden discarded Chinese 
dress, saying, &quot;Your sister is too, too cunning for Shampoo taste, no 
even sense her there.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Akane said, &quot;that&#39;s Nabiki for you, always poking her noise 
where its not wanted...&quot;

&quot;Mmmm.&quot;

Outside where Ranma was pacing...

&quot;So, was she in there?&quot; said the Saotome heir as he spied Nabiki coming 
up.

&quot;Yes, Ranma, she was.&quot; Answered Nabiki, as she came up to where Ranma 
was waiting.

&quot;Why was she so long in there anyways, she is usually out by now.&quot; 
Grumbled the boy.

&quot;Oh she and Shampoo was in this intense &#39;discussion&#39; on something.&quot; The 
girl smiled as she noted the worried look on the younger boy&#39;s face.

&quot;Shampoo? what was she doing in there? Was she-&quot;

&quot;Oh relax,&quot; the girl rolled her eyes, &quot;since when have those two come 
to blows.  The only kind of fights they have are throwing insults at 
each other.&quot; Though she thought, it seems their fights have gone to a 
new level.

Ranma frowned, but stayed where he was and waited some more till finally
the sound of two familiar voices could be heard coming towards them.

Turning, both Saotome and Tendou watched as a grumbling Akane and a 
smirking Shampoo came to a stop in front of Ranma.

&quot;Nihao! Airen!&quot; and to character, Shampoo latched onto the boy while 
pressing her lithe body onto Ranma&#39;s.

&quot;HEY! Stop that!&quot; shouted both Akane and Ranma, who then looked at each 
other while Nabiki only shook her head in amusement.

&quot;Aiyaah, is Airen and pervert-girl been practicing to do that?&quot; Shampoo 
inquired cheerfully.

&quot;Hmph, I&#39;m not the only pervert around here.&quot; Mumbled Akane, while 
Ranma missed the comment as he was trying to get Shampoo to let go.

&quot;Anyways,&quot; Nabiki cleared her throat, &quot;I&#39;m here on business, so...do 
you have my payment now Shampoo?&quot;

Blinking in confusion for a moment but then seem to remember something 
and let go of relieved Ranma.

&quot;Hiyaa! Shampoo forget.&quot; Reaching into the gulf between her breasts, 
Shampoo soon came out holding some rolled up yen notes.

&quot;Here go sneaky-girl, 3000 yen as you said.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, hope the information on our fair city helped you out.&quot;

Shampoo nodded, as Nabiki took the money.

&quot;Huh? What&#39;s that all about?&quot; Akane demanded.

But Nabiki was already on her way, saying, &quot;another time Akane, I&#39;ve got
people to see, yen to collect.&quot;

And with that said, she strolled off.

Turning to face Shampoo, Akane was about to ask her when she saw the 
Amazon leap up into the nearby tall tree.

&quot;Huh?&quot; both Ranma and Akane said, then suddenly a bike was launched 
from the top of the tree with a purple-haired girl right behind it.

&quot;Bye-bye, Airen, Shampoo need to go!&quot; with a wave at the pair, Shampoo 
soon mounted her bike as it and her landed onto a nearby roof.

&quot;Strange girl,&quot; muttered Ranma as he watched Shampoo ride off into the 
sunset.

&quot;You have no idea.&quot; Mumbled Akane.

&quot;Hmm? What was that Akane?&quot;

&quot;Nothing, nothing, lets start home ok?&quot;

With that said, Akane with school in hand started of towards her Dojo.

As Ranma soon joined her while walking on the nearby railing, the boy 
casually said, &quot;I wonder what was that all about with Nabiki and 
Shampoo.&quot;

Akane too, was thinking about that but decided not to think much about 
it yet.

&quot;Who knows, Ranma, who knows...&quot;


End of Chapter 2.


Author notes:
Annnnd that&#39;s a rap.  So what do you people think of that? You think I 
did a good enough job in the lemon scenes?

Sorry about not having this out sooner but I as usual got distracted 
with other stuff then an idea wouldn&#39;t go away and so I started another 
series called &#39;When the Cat&#39;s Away...&quot;.  It&#39;s a Shampoo based story(a 
very rare thing) and I&#39;m currently have no plans to have it turn into a 
yuri or lemon.

Anyways, next chapter is mostly planned out but first I&#39;m going to 
write chapter 3 of &#39;When the Cat&#39;s Away...&#39; since people on 
Fanfiction.net seem to like it.

Until next time...

Next up:
Things are really &#39;heating&#39; up between Shampoo and Akane, as the Amazon 
continues to find new ways to have &#39;fun&#39; with Akane.  While the Tendou 
Tomboy continues to wonder Shampoo&#39;s motives while she tries to hide 
her secret from Ranma...
