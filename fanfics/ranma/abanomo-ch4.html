IN THE THIRD PART OF &quot;RANKO, ABANDONED NO MORE,&quot; Shampoo and
Ukyou learn of Kodachi&#39;s tryst with Ranko.  Given that Ranko is
Ranma in a woman&#39;s body, the temptation she could present to
Ranma&#39;s two other would-be fiancees is considerable.  Ranko moves
to eliminate another problem by confessing to Kunou that she is a
lesbian.  After, Ranko enjoys some intimate time with Shampoo and
Ukyou.  That makes everyone feel guilty since if Kodachi, Shampoo
and Ukyou decide to pursue their own lovers, Ranko could be
emotionally devastated.  The next day, the three confer with
Cologne about their problem.  The aged matriarch proposes that
they build on their relationship with Ranko ...in other words,
give Ranma&#39;s sister her own companion.  And there is only one
place to do that, as Akane soon proposes to Ranma while they are
at Jusenkyou...

**** **** ****

And finally...ON WITH THE SHOW!!!!

**** **** ****

     &quot;Under normal circumstances, I would forbid this,&quot; Yi-xin
sighs as she, Ranma and Akane approach Nini-Quan-Qi-Niang.
&quot;These lost children deserve a peaceful existence here, not to be
re-exposed to the chaos of the real world.&quot;

     &quot;Well, it&#39;s a moot point now that Ranko-chan has her own
life,&quot; Akane sighs.  &quot;Besides, no matter how much we try to make
her feel welcome in our home, there&#39;ll always be a sense of
dislocation in her.  No one alive today&#39;s experienced what she&#39;s
undergone.&quot;

     &quot;True,&quot; the Chinese guardian stops before the bubbling mud
spring.  &quot;Very well, then.  Before you begin, I must warn you
that when you immerse yourself into the spring, you&#39;ll have no
control over which soul inhabits your replica&#39;s body.  If she&#39;s
anti-social, downright psychotic or possesses other
...undesirable qualities, don&#39;t blame me.&quot;

     &quot;We&#39;ve experienced worse,&quot; Ranma muses.

     Akane stares at the bubbling liquid soil, then undresses.
Yi-xin draws a knife to make two shallow cuts on her lower arms.
Once that is done, the youngest Tendou steps into the spring...

                           *    *    *

     &quot;Great-grandma, you sure this okay?&quot; Shampoo wonders.

     It is twenty minutes later.  Shampoo and Cologne approach
the spring from a private landing used by the Nyu-che-zuu when
they came to Jookoji-shima to celebrate their clan&#39;s origins.
Save for a small trail of drying mud leading from
Nini-Quan-Qi-Niang toward the distant temple, there is no sign
that Ranma, Akane or Yi-xin have been present.  &quot;It&#39;s fine,
Shampoo,&quot; the aged matriarch sighs.  &quot;I&#39;ve already informed the
clan elders in Juketsuzoku.  As far as they&#39;re concerned, Ranko
should not be living alone, even if Ranma&#39;s family have welcomed
her with open arms.  Prepare yourself, child.&quot;

     &quot;Hai!&quot; Shampoo nods as she undresses.  Once she has drawn a
ceremonial knife over her lower arms, she prays.  &quot;Honoured
sister-to-be, stand in Shampoo&#39;s place and give Ranko all your
love!&quot;

     She slips into the spring...

                           *    *    *

     &quot;Well, seeing as you are Ranma&#39;s best friend, I suppose you
could do this,&quot; Lee-shin nibbles on a freshly-cooked okonomiyaki
sprinkled with pulogi as she escorts Ukyou to Nini-Quan-Qi-Niang.
&quot;By the way, nice okonomiyaki,&quot; she smacks her lips.

     Another twenty minutes have passed.  Now, two trails of mud
lead away from the sacrificial spring.  &quot;My pleasure,&quot; Ukyou nods
as she places her portable stove down, then begins to undress.
Once she is nude, she prays.  &quot;Ranko-chan, I was denied the
chance to earn your brother&#39;s love and circumstances prevent me
from filling the gaping hole in your heart.  May the gift I
create today express all the dreams, hopes and aspirations I held
for Ran-chan.&quot;

     Lee-shin draws her knife over the okonomiyaki cook&#39;s arms,
then Ukyou moves into the spring...

                           *    *    *

     &quot;I am truly happy you were willing to help me do this for
poor Ranko-chan,&quot; Kodachi smiles as she and Mishin approach the
spring.  &quot;After all, she does deserve the best.  Don&#39;t you
agree?&quot;

     &quot;Well, seeing as how you were Saotome-san&#39;s fiancee, it
surprises me that you&#39;re willing to do this for his sister,&quot;
Mishin muses.

     Another twenty minutes have passed.  Three trails of mud now
lead away from Nini-Quan-Qi-Niang.  Kodachi stares at the
bubbling spring, then stretches herself.  &quot;Oooh, this will be a
mud bath to remember!&quot; she smiles, then quickly disrobes.
&quot;Dearest Ranko-chan, let she who will be reborn this day stand in
my place and give you the happiness you and your brother once
sought from me,&quot; she prays, then holds out her arms.  &quot;I&#39;m
ready.&quot;

     Mishin draws her knife over the gymnast&#39;s arms.  Kodachi
then slips into the spring...

                           *    *    *

     Sometime later, Mishin prays at the spring as Yi-xin
approaches.  &quot;Nihao, Mishin,&quot; the Chinese guardian smiles.
&quot;Where&#39;ve you been?&quot;

     &quot;Oh, konban wa, Yi-xin,&quot; the Japanese guardian beams.  &quot;I
just escorted one of Saotome-san&#39;s friends to the spring so she
could free another trapped soul to be Ranko-sama&#39;s companion.&quot;

     &quot;Oh, that&#39;s nice...eh?!!&quot; Yi-xin jolts.  &quot;Who?!!&quot;

     &quot;A martial arts rhythmic gymnast named Kodachi Kunou,&quot;
Mishin smiles, then notices her friend shivering.  &quot;What&#39;s
wrong?&quot;

     &quot;But...I just escorted Ranma&#39;s fiancee here so SHE could
make a double to be Ranko&#39;s companion!!!&quot; Yi-xin exclaims.

     Lee-shin walks up.  &quot;An nyong, Mishin, Yi-xin,&quot; she smiles,
then notices the others&#39; panicked looks.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong?!  You
two okay?!&quot;

     &quot;Lee-shin...you didn&#39;t escort someone here to make a
companion for Ranko, did you?&quot; Yi-xin turns to the Korean
guardian.

     &quot;I did!&quot; Lee-shin smiles.  &quot;Ranma&#39;s best friend showed up to
offer herself as a template so Ranko wouldn&#39;t be alone!  Great
cook, too; I got a free meal out of it.  She even spoke perfect
Korean...eh?!&quot; she blinks on seeing the stunned looks on her
friends&#39; faces.  &quot;What is it?&quot;

     The three look down, eyes widening on seeing the small
trails of mud leading out of Nini-Quan-Qi-Niang.  &quot;This is where
Akane Tendou came in,&quot; Yi-xin indicates one mud trail.

     &quot;Here&#39;s where Kunou-san came in,&quot; Mishin points to another.

     &quot;This is where Ukyou stepped in,&quot; Lee-shin indicates a
third.

     &quot;So who&#39;s the fourth?!&quot; Mishin points to the fourth trail.

     &quot;Ai-yah!!&quot; Yi-xin looks.  &quot;These small indents in the ground
must&#39;ve come from Matriarch Cologne&#39;s walking cane!  She lives in
Tokyo now, near where Ranma lives!&quot;

     The three guardians blink, gazing at the mud spring they
have sworn to guard.  &quot;Four companions for Ranko...?!&quot; they gasp.

                           *    *    *

     &quot;Ranma!!&quot; Ryouga Hibiki slaps his rival/friend across the
back.  &quot;You made it!  How&#39;d it go?!  Where&#39;s Akane?!&quot;

     Ranma places down his backpack.  They stand on the front
porch of the Tendou home.  &quot;It&#39;s great, especially if you&#39;re
really serious about marrying Akari-san these days!&quot; Ranma
smiles.  &quot;Let&#39;s go inside.  I&#39;ll tell you all about it.&quot;

     &quot;What about Akane?&quot;

     &quot;She&#39;s got a present for Ranko-chan,&quot; Ranma smiles.  &quot;She&#39;ll
be around in a bit...P-chan!&quot; he projects an evil grin.

     Ryouga scowls as they step inside.  &quot;Lucky thing you
discovered the cure or else I&#39;d&#39;ve killed you for that!!&quot;

     The two head inside.  Meanwhile, Ranko relaxes in the living
room of the Saotomes&#39; private wing.  A knock is heard, followed
by Akane&#39;s voice.  &quot;Ranko- chan?!  You inside?!&quot;

     &quot;C&#39;mon in, Akane-onee-chan!&quot; Ranko smiles, standing to open
the door, allowing her future sister in law into the living room.
&quot;What&#39;re you doing here?!  Shouldn&#39;t you be with Onii-chan?!&quot;

     &quot;In a minute,&quot; Akane guides Ranko into her bedroom.  &quot;But
first, I got something for you!&quot;

     &quot;You do?!!&quot; Ranko&#39;s eyes widen.  &quot;What?!  Tell me!!&quot;

     &quot;You sit here,&quot; Akane places her on her futon, then pulls
out a red bandanna.  &quot;And I have to put this over your eyes.&quot;

     She quickly blindfolds the lost child.  &quot;Why?&quot; Ranko blinks.

     &quot;Because it&#39;s a surprise,&quot; Akane smiles, ensuring Ranko
could not see over or under the bandanna.  &quot;Now, you just wait
right here and it&#39;ll be here in a moment.&quot;

     With that, Akane places a warm kiss on Ranko&#39;s lips, then
steps out of the bedroom.  &quot;I wonder what&#39;s going on?!&quot; the lost
girl crosses her arms, attuning her senses to detect when Akane&#39;s
present will enter.

     The door gently slides open a moment later.  Ranko lowers
her arms as gentle footfalls move past her.  Next comes the
squeak of someone kneeling in front of her.  &quot;Hi,&quot; Ranko smiles.
&quot;Who are you?&quot;

     The response nearly overwhelms Ranko as a wet kiss lands on
her lips.  Her guest&#39;s excited tongue lances into the lost girl&#39;s
mouth as Ranko feels a young woman&#39;s body press into hers.
Before she could reflexively pull the bandanna off to see who her
companion is, two strong hands seize hers, firmly forcing them
away from her head.  Ranko is gently shoved onto her back as
those arms wind around her shoulders.  All logical thought flies
from Ranko&#39;s mind as her arms pull her guest into her, detecting
the wide bow of a kimono&#39;s obi.

     After a few minutes of passionate kissing, the stranger&#39;s
lips move across Ranko&#39;s cheek to her right ear, then the tongue
begins to flick at the lobe and the aural canal.  Ranko feels her
heart accelerate as the stranger&#39;s tongue and nose play havoc
with her nerves.  As Ranma&#39;s sister, she possessed all his
intimate tastes; she LOVED it when someone played with her ears.
A heat builds in her body as the stranger continues her
passionate assault.  Ranko tries desperately to determine who she
is, but every time she tries to make her mind work, a flick of
the stranger&#39;s tongue or nose sends her into a tizzy.

     &quot;I&#39;m warm...&quot; Ranko softly pants.

     The stranger quickly obliges by unbuttoning Ranko&#39;s shirt.
The warmth now stiffens her breasts.  The stranger does not keep
them waiting long.  As one hand continues to gently trace Ranko&#39;s
ear, the other moves to her left breast, gently massaging the
nipple.  Her lips administer to the other.  Ranko feels her body
heat as the stranger continues her attack.  Attempts at trying to
forge some defence against her seduction is lost.  Ranko&#39;s hands
move down to untie her pants.  The stranger&#39;s hands then pull
them past her hips, helping Ranko slip out of her pants.  The
hands then guide Ranko&#39;s to the obi.

     &lt;&lt;I&#39;m warm, too,&gt;&gt; a strange voice echoes in Ranko&#39;s mind.

     Not needing an additional invitation, Ranko yanks off the
obi, then guides the kimono off the stranger&#39;s shoulders.  Her
hands gently slide over the stranger&#39;s body, confirming that no
other item of clothing restricted the lost girl from returning
the stranger&#39;s assault.  As the clothing is tossed aside, Ranko
draws the stranger face-to-face for another lip-to-lip
conversation.  The stranger shifts slightly to one side, allowing
Ranko&#39;s leg to rise between hers.  Likewise, the stranger&#39;s leg
is poised over Ranko&#39;s groin.  As their kisses become intense,
the intruding thigh then slams into Ranko&#39;s groin.

     Ranko gasps in stunned shock as the explosion from her groin
floods her senses, wiping away all rational thought.  Her own
thigh reciprocates the stranger&#39;s action, eliciting a like cry of
passion.  With that, their legs feverishly stroke the other&#39;s
body as their tongues lance into the other&#39;s mouth.  Ranko&#39;s back
arches as their arms mash their bodies together.  Time is no
longer relavant for the lovers...until their bodies finally,
mercifully, explode in a rolling orgasm that sends the stranger
sagging to Ranko&#39;s side, barely able to keep her arms around her.
Ranko&#39;s strength disintegrates as she falls on her back, her
hand blindly reaching for her seducer&#39;s body.

     &quot;Who are you?&quot; Ranma&#39;s sister pants.

     In response, a hand gently guides the bandanna away from
Ranko&#39;s eyes, allowing her to see...

     &quot;Hello, Ranko,&quot; Akane smiles.

     Ranko blinks, surprised that Akane was such a passionate,
skilled lover...then it hits her.  &quot;OH, GODS...!!!!&quot; she yelps,
rolling away to stand up, gazing at her seducer.  &quot;Akane,
what...?!!&quot;

     Akane is quickly on her feet, her hands gently grasping her
lover&#39;s.  &quot;I&#39;m not Akane, Ranko-chan,&quot; she purrs, blowing on
Ranko&#39;s other ear.  &quot;My little soul-sister...&quot;

     Ranko&#39;s legs nearly melt from underneath her, then her eyes
widen in disbelief.  &quot;&#39;Soul-sister&#39;...?!&quot; she hoarsely repeats,
then a shocked grin splits her face.  &quot;Sa-na...?!!&quot;

     &quot;It&#39;s Asana now,&quot; the woman before her smiles.  &quot;Asana
Tendou.  Onee-chan freed me from the spring so I could be with
you.  I missed you, Ranko-chan...&quot;

     They tearfully embrace, the experience of a timeless
eternity in the netherworld holding the souls of
Nini-Quan-Qi-Niang uniting them in ways Ranma&#39;s and Akane&#39;s
relationship could not.  Oh Sa-na was a five year old from
Cholla-do when, during the stormy years before the turn of the
century, she joined her parents in the Tonghak Peasant Army
fighting those trying to absorb Korea into the growing Japanese
empire.  Sa-na&#39;s father betrayed his battalion, leading them to a
major defeat.  Proud of her heritage, Sa-na turned her back on
her parents.  In vengeance over her lack of filial loyalty, they
sacrificed her in Nini-Quan- Qi-Niang.  Since that day in 1894,
Sa-na was close to the nameless baby who would be reborn as Ranko
Saotome.  Now, like Ranko, Asana was the emotional and spiritual
union of two people:  Oh Sa-na and Akane Tendou.

     &quot;I missed you too, Asana-chan,&quot; Ranko kisses her, then draws
her down.  &quot;Now, I&#39;ll show you how much I missed you!&quot;

     &quot;I can&#39;t wait!&quot; Asana growls.

     Just as their lips were about to reunite, a knock is heard
at the front door.  &quot;Who could that be?&quot; Ranko sits up.

     &quot;Hurry back,&quot; Asana whispers, slipping under the covers.

     Ranko grins as she slips on a housecoat, then heads to the
living room.  Sliding the door open, she blinks surprisedly on
seeing Shampoo standing there, now dressed in a thigh-length
green sleeveless dress decorated with flowers and tigers.
&quot;Nihao, Ranko,&quot; she seductively smiles, her voice velvet-smooth.
&quot;May I come in?&quot;

     Ranko shudders as the door closes behind the
warrior-maiden...

                           *    *    *

     ...but had she looked to the Tendous&#39; front porch, she would
have seen Shampoo standing there beside Mousse.  &quot;Ai-yah!!&quot;
Shampoo claps her hands delightfully.  &quot;It work!  Now Ranko won&#39;t
be alone anymore!&quot;

     &quot;Good thinking,&quot; the weaponsmaster adjusts his glasses.
&quot;C&#39;mon.  Let&#39;s hear the rest of Ranma&#39;s story.&quot;

     Shampoo nods as they head inside...

                           *    *    *

     Ranko would not appreciate Shampoo&#39;s candor.  &quot;Who are
you?!&quot; she stammers, backing away from the advancing double.
&quot;You&#39;re not Shampoo!&quot;

     &quot;No, I&#39;m not,&quot; the double admits.  &quot;But Shampoo freed me
from the spring, just like you were freed.  Stop that, Ranko!  I
want to get to know the woman you&#39;ve become...very...intimately!&quot;

     Ranko is suddenly backed into a wall.  The woman places her
hands on her shivering host, then leans up and delivers a very
warm kiss... just as Asana&#39;s bokan stick smacks into her head!
&quot;Ah-hah!!!&quot; Akane&#39;s sister snarls.  &quot;Onee-chan thought you&#39;d try
something, Shampoo!!!  Lay off Ranko-chan...NOW!!!!&quot;

     The woman sighs, then stares at her attacker.  &quot;Honestly,
Sa-na.  Is that the way to greet a friend?&quot;

     Asana blinks, then leans close.  &quot;Shang-feng?!&quot;

     &quot;Shang-feng?!&quot; Ranko echoes.

     &quot;You both sound surprised,&quot; Shampoo&#39;s sister smiles.  &quot;It&#39;s
a lucky thing I took the chance when Shampoo came along.  Someone
has to keep an eye on you two.&quot;

     Ranko and Asana exchange looks.  &quot;We&#39;re glad it&#39;s you,&quot; the
former embraces Shang-feng.  &quot;C&#39;mon.  Let&#39;s relax.&quot;

     They proceed into Ranko&#39;s room.  Once the door closes behind
them, Ranko and Asana exchange devious looks, then tackle their
friend to the futon, unleashing a tickle torture.  Shang-feng
gasps as the assault sends her onto her face, then retaliates.
&quot;You&#39;ll pay for that!!&quot;

     Ranko is shoved down, then Shang-feng leaps atop her,
drowning her with a kiss.  Asana grabs the reborn warrior-maiden
off Ranko, then begins to unfasten her dress.  &quot;C&#39;mon,
Ranko-chan,&quot; she purrs.  &quot;Let&#39;s play with our new toy!&quot;

     &quot;Aaah!!!&quot; Shang-feng yowls as Asana and Ranko shove her onto
the futon, yanking open her skirt.

     Soon, all three are without any clothing, frolicking under
the sheets.  Shang-feng&#39;s gasps turn into passionate moans as
Ranko&#39;s lips and tongue begin to tackle Shampoo&#39;s favourite
spots:  her neck and collar bones.  Asana keeps the new arrival&#39;s
mouth busy with her own.  Their hands free, both work on Shang-
feng&#39;s breasts, relaxing their movements to elicit a prolonged
amount of pleasure.

     However, Shang-feng is not a believer in taking one&#39;s time.

     Before Ranko or Asana could react, Shang-feng&#39;s hands dart
between their legs, playing total havoc.  Both cry out
surprisedly as Shang-feng, using Shampoo&#39;s cat-like agility,
wraps her legs around theirs, effectively pinning them.  &quot;Now, my
pretties,&quot; she muses, overwhelming Ranko with a kiss, then Asana.
&quot;Let&#39;s have some real fun and games.&quot;

     Ranko and Asana exchange conspiring looks, then as their
lips caress their companion&#39;s collar bones anew, their hands dive
for Shang-feng&#39;s groin.  She screeches surprisedly as Ranko&#39;s
fingers flick her while Asana&#39;s dive for gold.  &quot;Aaah!  Oh,
yes!!&quot; Shang-feng howls, their ministrations driving her own
fingers into frenzied action.  &quot;Yes!!  Keep going, keep
going...oh...oh!!&quot;

     Having arrived already aroused by Shampoo&#39;s desire to see
Ranko with a version of herself, it does not take Ranko and Asana
long to drive Shang-feng over the edge.  As she spasms, her back
arches back, reflexively drawing her fingers deep into her
lovers&#39; bodies.  The sudden jolt drives both Ranko and Asana over
the edge.  The cries are soft as the three finally let up,
allowing their passions to settle.  Arms slip around each other
as they bask in each other&#39;s presence.

     Finally, Asana fixes Shang-feng with a knowing glance.  &quot;I
see you&#39;re as feisty as ever!&quot; she kisses her.  &quot;Don&#39;t you know
when to take it easy?!&quot;

     &quot;Never been in my language, Sa-na,&quot; Shang-feng fires a coy
stare.  &quot;And with Shampoo as my older sister, it&#39;ll stay that way
for a long time to come.&quot;

     Asana&#39;s and Ranko&#39;s eyes roll.  In her first life, Nyu
Shang-feng was a member of the Nyu-che-zuu, born in the late
Mongol era to the ruling matriarch.  An accomplished warrior by
the time she was twelve, Shang-feng was captured by a local lord,
held for ransom to enforce the loyalty of her clanswomen.  Such
could have spelt the end of her clan had not Shang-feng,
attending the sacrifice of the lord&#39;s unwanted first-born twin
daughters, threw herself on a retainer&#39;s sword and fell into
Nini-Quan-Qi-Niang.  In vengeance, the Nyu-che-zuu destroyed the
lord&#39;s clan, then aided in driving the Monguls from China.
Shang-feng lucked out when she chose Shampoo as the vessel by
which to live her new life; to her, it was like coming home.

     &quot;Well, we wouldn&#39;t want you to change,&quot; Ranko kisses
Shang-feng, then blinks as another knock is heard at the door.
&quot;Who could that be?&quot;

     &quot;I&#39;ll go get it...&quot; Asana offers.

     &quot;No, you stay here,&quot; Ranko throws on her housecoat.  &quot;I&#39;ll
handle it.  I am the host, remember?&quot;

     She slips out of the bedroom.  &quot;I see Ranko&#39;s got Ranma&#39;s
desire for doing it all,&quot; Shang-feng muses.

     &quot;Well, it&#39;s mollified this time...I hope,&quot; Asana&#39;s eyes
roll.

     In the living room, Ranko straightens herself, then slides
open the door.  &quot;U-chan!!&quot; she smiles on seeing Ukyou, now
dressed in jeans and shirt.  &quot;What brings you here?!  Aren&#39;t you
listening in on what Onii-chan learned about Jusenkyou?!&quot;

     &quot;Doesn&#39;t concern me, love,&quot; Ukyou slips in, then draws an
arm around Ranko.  &quot;You do,&quot; she then huskily whispers.

     Ranko shudders, sweat pouring down her hair...

                           *    *    *

     ...as Ukyou observes this from the Tendous&#39; front porch.
&quot;Go for it, sis,&quot; the okonomiyaki cook beams.  &quot;Give her what she
wants!&quot;

     &quot;Hey, U-chan, get in here!!&quot; Ranma&#39;s voice echoes from
inside.  &quot;You gotta here the good part!&quot;

     &quot;Ah, coming, Ran-chan!!&quot; Ukyou smiles as she heads inside...

                           *    *    *

     Her double is now in Ranko&#39;s warm embrace, rubbing her
forehead against the latter&#39;s chin.  After the initial shock,
Ranko quickly relaxed, understanding that if Shampoo had hit on
the idea of going to Jookoji-shima, Ukyou would have done the
same.  &quot;Please tell me who you are,&quot; Ranko gently sighs.  &quot;We
can&#39;t recognize each other in this life.&quot;

     &quot;Don&#39;t you recognize me, Ranko-chan?&quot; the girl cutely gazes
at Ranko, then kisses her.  &quot;It&#39;s me, Shashi!&quot;

     &quot;SHASHI?!?!?!&quot; Asana and Shang-feng appear behind Ukyou&#39;s
sister.

     &quot;Sa-na, Shang-feng!!&quot; Shashi spins around, beaming at the
others&#39; presence.  &quot;I knew you two were here!  I&#39;m glad we&#39;re all
together!!&quot;

     &quot;I&#39;m NOT glad!!!&quot; Shang-feng glares angrily at Shashi.  &quot;Who
got you to leap into Ukyou&#39;s body when she dived into the
spring?!&quot;

     Shashi&#39;s eyes go REALLY wide, tears about to jet forth.
&quot;You don&#39;t like me being here?!&quot; she sniffs.

     &quot;No, not really!&quot; Asana sighs.  &quot;Now, will you please leave
us alone...?!&quot;

     &quot;Asana...!&quot; Ranko winces.

     Suddenly, a giant shriek of pain emits from Shashi, her
tears nearly drowning her three fellow lost girls all at once!

                           *    *    *

     &quot;What the heck&#39;s that?!!&quot; Ranma bolts to his feet, staring
in the direction of the Saotomes&#39; hut.

     &quot;Must be the neighbours, Ran-chan!&quot; Ukyou embarrassingly
smiles, then looks away, shuddering.  *Damn!!  Of all the girls
in that stupid spring, I had to get a cry-baby?!  Why me?!*

                           *    *    *

     Presently, Asana and Shang-feng are swimming for their lives
thanks to Shashi&#39;s shower of tears.  Ranko quickly reacts by
embracing the wailing teen from behind, placing a gentle kiss on
Shashi&#39;s neck.  &quot;Are you hurting, Sha- chan?&quot; she gently
whispers.

     Shashi sniffs, allowing her tears to abate.  &quot;All over.&quot;

     Ranko glares at Asana and Shang-feng.  &quot;Now, since you
insensitive lugs caused this, fix it...or else!!&quot; she
threateningly growls.

     Asana and Shang-feng exchange glances of resignation, then
nod.  Standing, they move to Shashi&#39;s sides, placing gentle
kisses on her cheeks and neck.  &quot;There, there, Shashi-chan,&quot; the
former sighs.  &quot;Don&#39;t cry.  We&#39;ll make it all better.&quot;

     &quot;Yeah, love, let&#39;s relax,&quot; the latter guides the new arrival
into the bedroom.

     Once on Ranko&#39;s futon, Asana and Shang-feng lay Shashi down,
then slowly undress her, kissing her every time more skin is
exposed.  This not only plays to Ukyou&#39;s private tastes...kisses
all over the body...but to Shashi&#39;s history.  In her first life,
Shashi was an abused child, despised by her father for not being
the son he so desperately wanted.  Ryuunosuke Fujinami got off
easy compared to Shashi; the latter was regularly beaten for not
being strong enough.  Worse, she did not have the benefit of
martial arts training.

     Finally, the abuse became so bad that Shashi&#39;s mother tried
to take the child and flee to Okinawa.  Shashi&#39;s father caught up
with them, beating his daughter to death and horribly mutilating
her mother before a Nyu-che-zuu fishing boat caught them.
Shashi&#39;s father was killed, her mother allowed to migrate to
China and Shashi&#39;s tortured soul laid to rest in
Nini-Quan-Qi-Niang.

     Laying back and watching Shashi being gently administered
to, Ranko privately wonders what persuaded Shashi to take another
chance at life after her experience.  However, within the
netherworld of the spring, the two had been very close, as close
as Ranma and Ukyou.

     Shashi moans as her body, now electrified by Asana&#39;s and
Shang-feng&#39;s many kisses, quivers, her eyes now locked on Ranko.
&quot;Ranko-chan, won&#39;t you kiss me?&quot; Ukyou&#39;s sister sweetly smiles.

     Ranko slowly crawls up to Shashi.  She draws Ukyou&#39;s sister
into a warm embrace, rolling around until Shashi now lays atop.
There, she begins.  Kiss to the lips, then the cheek, back to the
lips, then to other parts.  Every time she explores another
place, Ranko always returns to Shashi&#39;s lips.  This forces a
constant shifting of the body so Ranko could continue.  By the
time Ranko passes the breasts, she has to place Ukyou&#39;s sister on
a raised knee, the kneecap rubbing against Shashi&#39;s groin.
Shashi squeals with delight every time Ranko gently raises her to
get at her chest, then lowers her for mouth-to-mouth.  Shashi&#39;s
passions build and build until she obtains release by the time
Ranko hits her belly button.

     Her strength fading, Shashi slumps against Ranko, who rolls
back to allow her to regain her strength.  &quot;Oh, that was so
nice,&quot; she sighs.  &quot;Ranko-chan, you&#39;re the best.&quot;

     &quot;What does that make us?&quot; Shang-feng muses.  &quot;Chopped
liver?&quot;

     Shashi sticks her tongue at Shampoo&#39;s sister.  &quot;Nyaa!!&quot;

     It turns into a duel of the tongues, which is quickly halted
by knocking at the front door.  &quot;Who could that be?!&quot; Ranko
rises, heading out.

     Once in the living room, Ranko opens the door, revealing
Kodachi.  &quot;Ranko- chan,&quot; the rhythmic gymnast, now dressed
outlandishly in a tuxedo fitted with top hat and cane, slides in.
&quot;May I come in?&quot;

     Ranko feels her body twitch fearfully...

                           *    *    *

     Kodachi watches this from the living room.  &quot;Enjoy,
Ranko-chan,&quot; she snickers, then returns her attention to Ranma...

                           *    *    *

     &quot;Kodayuu?!&quot; Ranko mutters.  &quot;You had to come out, too!&quot;

     &quot;Is that a way to greet an old friend?!&quot; Kodayuu doffs her
top hat, then swings around to lean back into Ranko&#39;s chest.
&quot;We&#39;re all one big happy family now, Ranko-chan!  Please try to
enjoy it!!&quot;

     The bedroom door opens, revealing Ranko&#39;s other visitors.
&quot;Oh, no, Kodachi, too?!!&quot; Asana gapes.

     &quot;Oh, it&#39;s Kodayuu-chan!!&quot; Shashi gleefully claps her hands.
&quot;I&#39;m so glad she&#39;s here!&quot;

     &quot;Speak for yourself, Shashi,&quot; Shang-feng mutters.  &quot;Ugh,
who&#39;s idea was this, anyway?!&quot;

     &quot;Ah, do I hear the jealous ramblings of Nyu Shang-feng?&quot;
Kodayuu smiles, twirling around, making Ranko slip off her
jacket.  &quot;Well, the idea of having Shashi here doesn&#39;t bother me
too much.  Even Sa-na is quite pleasant in her own way,&quot; she
twirls around to come face-to-face with Shampoo&#39;s sister.  &quot;But
if you think you&#39;re taking charge of this little troupe,
Shang-feng, think again!&quot;

     &quot;That all depends on Ranko, doesn&#39;t it?!&quot; Shang-feng muses.
&quot;This IS her house, remember?!&quot;

     Ominous lightning flashes between them.  &quot;Why me...?&quot; Ranko
sinks to her knees.

     &quot;Now, now, you two,&quot; Shashi tries to break Kodayuu and
Shang-feng apart.  &quot;Stop fighting!  We&#39;re all in this together!!
Relax!&quot;

     &quot;Butt out of this, Shashi!!&quot; Kodayuu snarls, glaring at her.

     Seeing her angry stare, Shashi&#39;s eyes instantly fill with
tears.  &quot;You don&#39;t like me...?!&quot; she sobs, then wails.

     Kodayuu and Shang-feng are instantly deluged by the water!!
Both are dumped unceremoniously by the front door.  As Asana
tries to calm the wailing Shashi down, Kodayuu and Shang-feng
face off, weapons ready.  &quot;Time for you to get a serious attitude
adjustment, Kunou!&quot; the latter snarls, brandishing her bonbons.
&quot;You always had it...in BOTH lives!&quot;

     &quot;Let&#39;s see you put your money where your mouth is!!&quot; Kodayuu
draws her whip, the other hand twirling a baton.

     Before they could launch an attack, Ranko appears between
them.  &quot;Kodayuu, aren&#39;t your forgetting something?&quot; she crosses
her arms.

     &quot;What?!&quot; Kodayuu blinks confusedly.

     Ranko points to Shashi, on her knees, sprinkles of tears
dousing Asana, failing to calm Ukyou&#39;s sister down.  Staring at
the weeping girl, Kodayuu shudders.  Lowering her weapons, she
walks over, gently guides Shashi to her feet, kisses her, then
guides her into the bedroom.  &quot;What are you going to do,
Kodayuu-chan?&quot; Shashi wonders as Kodayuu guides her to the futon.

     &quot;What do you think?&quot; Kodayuu smiles as she begins to gently
kiss her companion.  &quot;I don&#39;t like it when someone doesn&#39;t smile
around me.  Now, I have to make you smile.&quot;

     &quot;Oooh, I like that!&quot; Shashi giggles.

     Ranko, Asana and Shang-feng exchange knowing looks.  As a
rhythmic martial arts gymnast, Kodachi was at heart a showman,
someone who loved performing in a crowd, always the centre of
attention.  That matched her perfectly to Kodayuu.  In her first
life, Kodayuu tried her best to please everyone around her.  Her
parents doted on her constantly.  This, sadly, earned the ire of
her brothers and sisters, who were jealous of Kodayuu&#39;s
popularity.  Nini-Quan-Qi-Niang became their final solution, the
perfect way to dispose of an unwanted sibling.

     As Kodayuu administers to Shashi, her eyes fall on the three
other resurrected lost girls.  Stopping her ministrations, she
guides the others into the bedroom, then closes the door...

                           *    *    *

     Genma laughs.  &quot;Ah, Ranma, you finally succeeded in finding
the cure for Jusenkyou!!&quot;

     &quot;What&#39;s even better, you&#39;ll have to start a family because
of it!&quot; Souun places a hand on his daughter&#39;s shoulder, then his
future son-in-law&#39;s.  &quot;Like it or not, you can&#39;t escape it this
time!&quot;

     &quot;Well, at least we&#39;ll take our time in deciding when to do
it,&quot; Ranma sighs.

     Hearing that, Ukyou, Shampoo and Kodachi shudder.  &quot;Well,
now that we&#39;ve resolved that, where&#39;s Ranko-chan?&quot; Nodoka looks
around.  &quot;She should be here to celebrate her brother&#39;s triumph!&quot;

     &quot;Oh, I think Asana-chan&#39;s going to keep her too busy to
worry about Ranma, Mrs. Saotome,&quot; Akane blushes.

     Everyone jolts.  &quot;Who&#39;s Asana?!&quot; Souun demands.

     &quot;Why, my new twin sister!&quot; Akane beams.  &quot;After we were done
with Jusenkyou, Ranma and I made a stop...at Jookoji-shima!&quot;

     Cologne slaps her forehead.  Hearing this, Ukyou, Shampoo
and Kodachi bolt to their feet.  &quot;***YOU DID WHAT?!?!?!***&quot;

     &quot;That&#39;s right!&quot; Akane&#39;s eyes narrow conspiratorally.  &quot;I
thought it was unfair that the double to MY fiance was all alone!
So it was only proper that I&#39;d give Ranko-chan a double of
MYSELF for her to love and cherish...and ensure Ranko-chan keeps
away from you!!&quot; she fires her rivals very angry stares.

     &quot;Akane do what for Ranko?!!&quot; Shampoo snaps.  &quot;Hah!!  Akane
double probably worse violent tomboy than Akane!!  At least
Shang-feng give Ranko PROPER companionship!!&quot;

     &quot;Who&#39;s Shang-feng?!!&quot; Kodachi snaps.

     &quot;Shampoo&#39;s sister!&quot; Shampoo smiles.  &quot;She actually great
warrior of Nyu- che-zuu who die to save clan from stupid Monguls!
Now, Shang-feng save Ranko from Akane&#39;s stupid tomboy sister!!&quot;

     &quot;Not if MY sister has something to say about it!!&quot; Kodachi
sneers.

     &quot;Not to mention MY sister!!!&quot; Ukyou adds.

     Ukyou and Kodachi spin on each other.  &quot;YOU, TOO?!?!?!&quot; both
gasp.

     &quot;***WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?!?!?!***&quot; Nodoka transforms
into a very scary monster as she glares at the four panicking
women.  &quot;***YOU MEAN TO SAY ALL FOUR OF YOU MADE DOUBLES OF
YOURSELF FOR RANKO?!?!?!***&quot;

     &quot;How am I going to explain all THIS to the clan?!&quot; Cologne
moans.

     &quot;Have you four lost your minds?!!&quot; Nodoka returns to normal.
&quot;May I remind you that while Ranko-chan and those four you just
released from Nini-Quan-Qi- Niang may be as physically mature as
you, emotionally, they&#39;re still little children!!!  You may have
just committed five acts of child rape by sending them after
Ranko-chan!!!&quot;

     &quot;That&#39;s not true, Nodoka,&quot; Cologne cuts it.  &quot;Those reborn
of the mud spring automatically absorb the experiences and
emotions of their templates.  True, their original lives do
factor into their emotional makeup, but not that much.  They only
serve to be a guidepost for the reborn lost girl to live her new
life.&quot;

     &quot;Well, no matter what, we better take a look,&quot; Ranma bolts
to his feet.  &quot;Who knows what might&#39;ve happened.&quot;

     The crowd streams out of the Tendous&#39; home, gently entering
the Saotomes&#39; new wing.  Ranma tip-toes to the door of Ranko&#39;s
room, peeking in.  &quot;Ranko-chan?  You okay...eh?&quot;

     Akane, Shampoo, Ukyou and Kodachi look.  In the bedroom, an
extra futon has been laid out for Ranko&#39;s guests.  All are now
asleep.  The hostess herself is in the middle of the crowd, Asana
in the crook of one arm with Shashi hugging Akane&#39;s sister from
behind.  On the other side, Kodayuu lays back-first to Ranko,
holding Shang-feng.  &quot;Oh, isn&#39;t that sweet!&quot; Ukyou whispers.

     &quot;Let&#39;s leave them alone now,&quot; Akane whispers.

     Before they could leave, the window to Ranko&#39;s room opens to
reveal a diminutive ball of very aged, hormone-charged martial
artist.  &quot;SWEETO!!!!&quot; Happousai howls gleefully as his eyes dance
over the five sleeping girls.  &quot;Hot- cha!!!  All these lovely
ladies and they&#39;re all for me!!!&quot;

     Before he could launch himself against one, Ranko&#39;s hand
rises, palm facing the charging Happousai.  Asana&#39;s, Kodayuu&#39;s,
Shashi&#39;s and Shang-feng&#39;s rise in turn.  The five bark,
&quot;***PASSION-DEATH INNOCENCE SHIELD STRIKE!!!!!!***&quot; as five bolts
of energy merge into a giant ball of ki power, lashing forth to
slam Happousai in the heart!!

     The old master, now fried black, flies into orbit!  &quot;That
hurt!&quot;

     The hands lower as the five women return to their slumber.
Now possessing a healthy dose of respect for their sisters, their
templates quickly withdraw.  &quot;I don&#39;t think that old lech&#39;s going
to get away with anything concerning those five,&quot; Ranma muses.

     &quot;I don&#39;t think so, either,&quot; Ukyou sighs.  &quot;Lucky Ranko-chan!
By the looks of it, she got to do all our sisters!&quot;

     &quot;Which makes me wonder,&quot; Kodachi smiles, gazing at Ranma.
&quot;If Ranko-chan is so full of desire, where does it leave dear
Ranma-kun?!&quot;

     Ranma jolts as Ukyou, Shampoo and Kodachi longingly gaze on
him.  &quot;H-hey, cut it out!!&quot; he stammers, waving them away.  &quot;I
mean it!!  Lay off me, you three horny idiots!!!&quot;

     Weapons appear as the three charge.  Ranma howls as he takes
off, his three would-be fiancees on his tail.  Akane takes off
after him, Mallet-sama out and ready.  &quot;Come back here, you
pervert!!  Stop trying to seduce those three!!!&quot;

     &quot;Saotome, you bastard, stop trying to entice Shampoo!!&quot;
Mousse howls as he lunges into pursuit.

     As another mad chase takes off through the streets of
Nerima, Ranko and her companions observe from the window of her
room.  &quot;Those idiots&#39;ll never get it...!&quot; Ranma&#39;s sister muses...

                      *** Never The End ***
