------------------------------------------------
 
  Akane moaned as Shampoo lightly caressed her naked form, and
redoubled her efforts to please the other girl, wringing an
involuntary gasp from Shampoo&#39;s lips as she let her tongue run 
over Shampoo&#39;s lovely breast with its delightfully erect nipple.  
Akane could feel the desire that was raging throughout her body, 
and fancied that she could also feel Shampoo&#39;s lust radiating out 
from the magnificent body that was sharing her bed. Certainly she 
could feel the excitement in Shampoo&#39;s actions and the involuntary
shudders that matched those in her own body.  Akane knew she was
starting to lose control of herself, but remembered the passion
Shampoo had shared with her and let the memory seduce her into
seeking it once more.
  Then an alarm sounded.  Both girls jumped apart, guilt and
adrenalin temporarily banishing lust, and looked around.  Akane
grabbed her clock:
  &quot;This CAN&#39;T be the time!&quot;
  &quot;Why not?&quot; asked Shampoo, &quot;We have busy morning, yes?&quot;
  &quot;Well, yes, but ...&quot; Akane shook her head and stood up next to
the bed.
  &quot;Sorry Shampoo, but I have to go to school, and there&#39;s barely
enough time for a shower first.&quot;
  &quot;Let me help you.  Wash twice as fast with two pairs of hands.&quot;
Akane smiled at the thought.
  &quot;We might wash twice as fast Shampoo, but the shower WOULD take
longer.  I really am sorry but I have to rush.&quot;
   Akane grabbed a bathrobe and pulled it on as she headed for
the door.
  &quot;There&#39;s a spare robe in the wardrobe Shampoo, you can use that
until you get dressed.&quot;
  Shampoo glared at the retreating figure, and then stood up and
walked over to get the bathrobe Akane had pointed out.  It was most
rude of Akane to walk out on her after getting her excited.  Still,
it probably was time to head back to the Nekohanten.  Some
breakfast first, then a shower when Akane had finished, then back to
the Nekohanten she decided as she pulled on the bathrobe.  Shampoo
paused at the door and looked back at the crumpled and sweat (and
other) stained sheets on Akane&#39;s bed, she smiled at the sight:  It
had been a fun night.
  Shampoo headed into the Tendo kitchen and began hunting around
for something to eat. Now where did Kasumi keep the ingredients and
cooking implements?  Shampoo hauled out what she required and laid
them out on one of the benches.  As she did this she noted that
there was no sign of a lunch for Akane.  Shampoo smiled.  A nice
lunch for her lover couldn&#39;t hurt, she thought, and set to work.  As
Shampoo worked, something about the kitchen started to bother her.
At first she couldn&#39;t place what it was, but as she finished up
Akane&#39;s lunch and her breakfast it struck her:  The kitchen was
spotless, except for what she had done.  There was no sign that
anyone else had been down here for breakfast today.
  Shampoo took her breakfast into the dining room and looked
around her; everthing was immaculate.  Kasumi had been through and
cleaned since last time the room was used.  Shampoo sat down
thoughtfully and began to eat.  Something was wrong at the Tendo
Dojo; she could feel it, but she couldn&#39;t pin it down.  As she ate,
a scrap of paper caught her eye.  A quick investigation showed it to
be a note:
  &quot;Soun &amp; Genma have shamed their teacher.  I will give them extra
training and be back in 2 days with worthy pupils or corpses. -
Happosai&quot;
Shampoo frowned.  She didn&#39;t care about Tendo Soun but it was
demeaning for her future father-in-law to be kow-towing to that
decrepit pervert.  Still, it explained why they weren&#39;t down here
demanding food.
  There was a noise at the hall doorway, and Akane walked into
the room.  Shampoo blinked.  Akane was still wearing the bathrobe
she had walked out of her bedroom in, only now it was open,
exposing her naked body to any that cared to look.  Shampoo took
note of the glistening wetness between her legs and the prominence
of her nipples, and felt excitement begining to rise in her own
body.  Shampoo stood up and walked over to Akane.
  &quot;What happened to shower then go to school?&quot; Akane blushed, then 
reached out to Shampoo and undid her robe and pushed it back.  
Shampoo shrugged her shoulders to help Akane strip her, then 
reached out and pulled the open robe off Akane.  For a second the 
two girls stood there and looked at each other, then Akane wrapped 
her arms around Shampoo and held their bodies together as she 
pressed her lips against Shampoo&#39;s and welcomed Shampoo&#39;s tongue 
into her mouth.
  Some minutes later Akane lay back in Shampoo&#39;s arms, supported
by an arm that encircled her body and fondled one breast while
Shampoo&#39;s other hand gently moved between Akane&#39;s legs, drawing
moans of pleasure from her.  Shampoo broke their latest kiss and
smiled down at the radiant face of her lover.
  &quot;Akane ready to talk yet?&quot;
  Akane returned the smile and gazed back at the face above her,
drinking in the beauty of it&#39;s symmetry and unconscious sexuality,
basking in the pleasure that radiated through her from wherever
Shampoo touched her.  She wondered where Ranma had found the
strength to turn down this chinese wonderland so many times.  Akane
felt that she couldn&#39;t say no to anything Shampoo wanted at that
moment, and she did need to talk.
  &quot;I&#39;m ready.  I ..., I went down to the changing room and started
to undress, but before I could do more than open my robe I heard
something ..., voices gasping in ectasy and moaning with pleasure. 
I ..., I went over to the bathroom door and opened it a crack so I
could peek through.  Kasumi and Nabiki were in there.  They ...,
they were ... doing what we did last night, are doing now.&quot;
  Shampoo looked down at Akane, &quot;So you watched them for a while 
and then came to me when you got hotter than you could stand?&quot; 
Akane blushed.  Shampoo moved her hand to Akane&#39;s clit and applied 
the touch she had discovered that Akane really loved.  Akane 
gasped and arced her body, supported only by Shampoo&#39;s arm.
  &quot;Would have been easier to stay in bed Akane-chan.  Want to go 
back?&quot; Shampoo smiled at Akane and enjoyed the sight of the fit, 
trim and beautiful body in her arms.  Shampoo gave thanks yet again 
that Akane didn&#39;t really know how to show off or use her body in the 
sexual arena, otherwise Ranma would have had to marry her by now.
  Akane shivered a little and shook her head, then she sat up and
leant back into Shampoo&#39;s arms.
  &quot;When I looked into the bathroom and saw my sisters, at first I 
was amazed, then I was horrified, then, then I got hot and started 
to play with myself, and I didn&#39;t realize what I was doing until, 
until I started to cum.  Kasumi and Nabiki had stopped what they 
were doing to watch me, when I finished cumming, Kasumi asked if 
I wanted to join them.  I .. I shook my head and walked away to 
look for you. If you hadn&#39;t been here I would have had to go back 
to them.  I was so hot!&quot;
  Shampoo put her arms around Akane and hugged the other girl, 
making sure to plant a passionate kiss on her lips while rubbing 
her tits.  Akane returned her attentions with vigour and 
conversation faded as lust took hold.
  Some time later Shampoo sat with her back to the wall and played
with her breasts as Akane&#39;s mouth and tongue explored her cunt 
yet again.Shampoo was relaxed despite what was being done to her 
and felt that when Akane finished making her cum she would have 
had enough for now, though she would give Akane another orgasm if 
she wanted one.  As the heat in her loins spread throughout her 
body and started to wash away conscious control Shampoo noticed a 
naked Kasumi and Nabiki walk into the room, Kasumi appeared to be
fondling Nabiki&#39;s breasts while Nabiki was pointing a camera at her 
and Akane.  Shampoo felt a wave of embarrassment sweep over her, 
adding somehow to the pleasure Akane was giving her, and tried to 
stand.  Akane took this as a reason to send Shampoo over the edge 
of pleasure into uncontrolled orgasm, and for several minutes 
Shampoo writhed in sexual abandon to Akane&#39;s ministrations while 
Nabiki snapped pictures, until Kasumi&#39;s attentions sent Nabiki into 
the same state as Shampoo, ending her photographic efforts.
  Shampoo shook herself free of Akanes grip, and the post orgasmic
lassitude that tried to overwhelm her, rose to her feet and stalked 
over to Nabiki.
  &quot;Who said you could take pictures!&quot; Nabiki cringed away from the 
angry Shampoo, her knowledge of Shampoo&#39;s abilities and personality 
leaving her no doubt of the danger she was in. Kasumi drew Nabiki 
to herself protectively and stood to face Shampoo.
  &quot;There&#39;s no need to over-react Shampoo-chan, we just assumed you 
didn&#39;t mind when you didn&#39;t object straight away.&quot; Akane got up and 
stood next to Shampoo, having finally realised what had made her 
lover angry.
  &quot;Nabiki Onee-chan! You took photo&#39;s of me and Shampoo!  How could 
you!&quot; Nabiki peeked out from behind Kasumi.
  &quot;Ah...  I didn&#39;t want to interrupt you by asking permission, and 
the scene was to ... delicious ... to pass up.&quot; Akane and Shampoo 
both blushed.  Shampoo also sent an embarrassed glare at Nabiki.
  &quot;You nosy little miser!  What we do is none of YOUR business!&quot;
Kasumi drew herself up and glared down at Shampoo, who stepped back 
in surprise, never having seen Kasumi angry before.
  &quot;If you and Akane wanted privacy you should have gone up to 
Akane&#39;s room, not played around on the living room floor!&quot; Akane 
and Shampoo wilted under Kasumi&#39;s blast and exchanged embarrassed
glances.  Kasumi continued:
  &quot;Since you&#39;re so upset about it, take the camera and develop the 
film yourselves, do what you like with the pictures of you, just 
make sure that you give me and Nabiki OUR pictures.&quot; Akane stepped 
forward and picked up the camera, then bowed to Kasumi.
  &quot;Yes Kasumi Onee-sama.&quot; Kasumi relaxed from her angry stance and 
smiled at Akane.
  &quot;Good.  Now that&#39;s settled, would everyone like some lunch?&quot;
Nabiki stepped out from behind Kasumi.
  &quot;Before we get onto lunch, theres still some unused pictures on 
that film, could Akane-chan use them up on the two of us, Kasumi 
Onee-sama?&quot; Kasumi looked at Nabiki and blushed a little, then 
turned to Akane.
  &quot;I don&#39;t mind.  Is it alright with you Akane?&quot; Akane blushed a 
lot but nodded her head.  Nabiki smiled and embraced her older 
sister.
  &quot;Just snap the photo&#39;s when you think there&#39;s a good shot 
Akane-chan, don&#39;t bother trying to get us to hold still.&quot; An 
extremely flushed Akane nodded her head and bought the camera to 
position, then turned to Shampoo.
  &quot;Please hold me Shampoo, I&#39;ll need some support to finish this.&quot;
Shampoo walked behind Akane and wrapped her arms around the other 
girl and settled in to enjoy both the show and the girl in her arms.
 
The End (for Now)...
