<h1>Dragon Lady of Macross (part 23 of 30)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/calamity.html">Calamity-Queen of Cordite</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/dragonlady-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>May 2010...

The SDF-1 had finished its refit and repair and was currently traveling 
at an altitude of 2000 ft directly over a large North American city. In 
spite of this altitude, the enormous size of the ship, still in its 
battoid configuration, made it seem so close the people on the streets 
felt the urge to duck. This was especially so since the massive fortress 
was traveling at a speed of about 30 knots and appeared to be hung 
precariously suspended just above the roof tops.

It was a calculated move that Captain Gloval had come up with to try to 
raise public awareness of the plight of the citizens of Macross. When he 
had been ordered to increase altitude, he had broadcast in the clear 
about how that couldn&#39;t happen because of the danger to the 60,000 
civilians they carried onboard. And it seemed the plan was successful.

They had received an encrypted message from the North American Ontario 
Quadrant that they would be happy to take any civilians that wished to 
leave the ship as residents there. So it was that the SDF-1 changed 
course and headed for the Ontario Quadrant.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma walked up next to Rick who was standing on the observation deck 
watching the cityscape below creep by. She leaned on the railing much as 
Rick was doing and silently watched for a minute.

&quot;Finally set you free, huh?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Yeah, I figured I&#39;d come up here and get some fresh air while I could,&quot; 
Rick replied.

They stood and watched silently for a few minutes and then Rick spoke.

&quot;It&#39;s scary, you know?&quot; Rick said. &quot;I mean I always thought Big Brother 
was indestructible. He went through the Global Civil War without a 
scratch and he came through the whole trip home and nothing touched him. 
Then suddenly it&#39;s over for him.&quot; Rick snapped his finger. &quot;Just like 
that. He almost died. It makes me think that if he couldn&#39;t make it 
through, what chance do the rest of us have?&quot; Ranma nodded.

&quot;Okay,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I can understand how you would think that. How 
about instead of thinking about what chance we have, you think about 
what choice we have? We have a job to do and people to protect. If we 
die trying then at least we know we gave everything we had. There&#39;s a 
sense of comfort knowing we did not &#39;go gently into that good night&#39;. 
That peacenik hypocrite Kyle would have us throw down our weapons and 
bare our bellies to these Zentradi. What do you suppose would happen 
then? The Zentradi would take their ball and go home because we refuse 
to play anymore? Heh, if only it were that easy. At best, we&#39;d be 
enslaved. At worst, we&#39;d be euthanized.&quot;

&quot;I guess you&#39;re right,&quot; Rick said. &quot;I certainly wouldn&#39;t want to be a 
slave of some alien race and the other alternative is even less 
pleasant.&quot;

&quot;We do what we have to do,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Some of us are gonna die doing 
it. A lot of us already have. We have to make their lives and deaths 
mean something. So we continue the fight and hope to make their 
sacrifices count. Roy gave up something important to him to protect all 
of us. We have to make that have some kind of meaning.&quot;

&quot;I never thought of it that way,&quot; Rick said. &quot;You&#39;re right. It wouldn&#39;t 
be fair of us to roll over now that so many of us paid with their lives. 
Thanks DL. I think I&#39;ll go check out my new plane now.&quot;

&quot;Sure, Rickhead,&quot; Ranma smiled. &quot;Make sure you treat her right, now. 
She&#39;s been with us a while. Wild Rose One and Skull One are the only 
remaining S models left.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

High above the SDF-1, a heated argument was taking place between a 
certain blue-haired warlord and Azonia, the commander of the Zentradi 
task force. It seemed the orders not to destroy the SDF-1 didn&#39;t sit too 
well with the repeatedly humiliated Kyron. Once again he decided he had 
had enough of sitting on his hands and devised yet another plan to 
attack the fortress against orders.

Shortly after that, Azonia had another visitor, this time with a strange 
request. It seemed that Miriya was deeply disturbed by her defeat at the 
hands of the Micronian pilot and wished to be Micronized and placed 
aboard the SDF-1, ostensibly to be a spy, but the real purpose was to 
hunt this Micronian down and personally eliminate the threat. After she 
had killed the one that defeated her, perhaps she would challenge this 
&#39;Dragon Lady&#39; and remove her as a threat as well.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Hey, there he is,&quot; Ben said to Malcolm. &quot;Hey Boss, what&#39;s up?&quot;

&quot;S&#39;up?&quot; Malcolm greeted.

&quot;Nothing, guys,&quot; Rick said. &quot;Just getting familiar with the differences 
in my new plane here. It&#39;s an S model. It has a lot of extra stuff in it 
than the J model I usually fly.&quot;

&quot;Say, isn&#39;t this Commander Fokker&#39;s plane?&quot; Malcolm asked.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Rick said. &quot;I&#39;ll be flying it now. Pretty ironic when you think 
about it.&quot;

&quot;How so?&quot; Ben asked.

&quot;Well, Big Brother was always so proud of the fact that he never got 
shot down,&quot; Rick said. &quot;Now I&#39;ll be flying his plane and I&#39;m the guy 
that&#39;s always getting shot down.&quot;

&quot;Well, maybe your luck will change now,&quot; Ben said. &quot;Anyway, Malcolm and 
I were going to this new steak place that just opened. You wanna come 
along?&quot;

&quot;You know,&quot; Rick said as he closed an access panel, &quot;that sounds like a 
great idea. In fact it sounds so good, I think the meal&#39;s on me.&quot;

&quot;Hey alright!&quot; Ben cheered. &quot;That sounds like just the thing the new 
pilot of Skull One would do.&quot;

The big man clapped both Rick and Malcolm on the shoulders and directed 
them toward the hanger deck exit.

(oO\O/Oo)

Minmei came out of the dressing room and her agent immediately descended 
on her.

&quot;Minmei, come on, they&#39;re waiting on you,&quot; the bespectacled man said. 
&quot;We have to...go...Are you okay?&quot;

Minmei looked glassy-eyed and her movements seemed a bit uncoordinated. 
She stood a bit unsteadily and blinked at him.

&quot;Oh, sure,&quot; Minmei reassured him. &quot;I&#39;m fine. Nothing to worry about. I&#39;m 
just a little...tired...is...all.&quot;

As she said this, she slowly fell forward into her agent&#39;s arms as 
consciousness fled her.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Mmmm, that was good,&quot; Ranma said as she polished off her second giant 
super-deluxe sirloin steak as her mother and Kasumi gaped at her. Akane 
was used to seeing Ranma put away massive quantities of food so wasn&#39;t 
shocked.

&quot;Well, you certainly get your appetite from your father,&quot; Nodoka 
commented and Kasumi nodded in agreement.

&quot;Don&#39;t even go there,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;My appetite comes from my active 
life. Genma&#39;s was just plain gluttony.&quot; Ranma was clearly a bit miffed 
at being compared to her father in any way.

&quot;Hey DL,&quot; Ranma turned to see Rick and his flight mates sit down beside 
them.

&quot;Hey, Rickhead,&quot; Ranma grinned. &quot;How&#39;s it going?&quot;

&quot;Oh, well, the guys heard about this new steak place and invited me 
along so I figured I&#39;d treat them,&quot; Rick said. &quot;Is it any good?&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Ranma said with a dreamy look on her face. &quot;It&#39;s wonderful. 
I&#39;m thinking of having another.&quot;

The cook shook his head in disbelief. How one small girl could eat so 
much was beyond him, but at least business was good. As he took the 
three men&#39;s orders, he sighed as he received yet another order for the 
giant super-deluxe from the big guy. He hoped his supplies would last 
the night.

&quot;So Ranma, Dear, who is you friend?&quot; Nodoka asked.

&quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Momma this is Rick Hunter. He&#39;ll be taking 
over Commander Fokker&#39;s squadron. Roy and I raised him up from a 
reckless, loudmouth little cherry into the promising young fighter pilot 
he is today. Rickhead, this is my mother, Nodoka Saotome. Next to her is 
Akane&#39;s sister, Doctor Kasumi Tendo. Of course you all know Akane.&quot;

&quot;Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Saotome, Miss Tendo,&quot; Rick greeted. &quot;These 
are members of my squadron, Ben Dixon and Malcolm McCorkle.&quot;

&quot;Pleased to meet you,&quot; Kasumi said.

&quot;How do you do?&quot; Nodoka greeted.

&quot;Wow, the Dragon Lady has a mother,&quot; Ben said with a chuckle. &quot;I guess 
the rumors that she was spawned from the pits of hell and sent here to 
torment us weren&#39;t true after all.&quot; Ranma and Akane laughed.

&quot;Oh you never know,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I do so enjoy tormenting loudmouth 
cherries that think they know better than seasoned fighter pilots.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re so good at it too,&quot; Rick quipped.

&quot;Here you go,&quot; the cook said handing Ben his steak. &quot;One Giant 
Super-Deluxe Sirloin, medium rare.&quot;

&quot;Geez, Man, you gonna eat all that?&quot; Malcolm asked as he eyed the huge 
slab of meat in front of the big man.

&quot;Heh, it looks so good, I might just order another,&quot; Ben said, digging 
in.

&quot;Why not? I did,&quot; Ranma smirked as the three men goggled at her.

Just then General Quarters sounded.

&quot;General Quarters, General Quarters,&quot; Lisa&#39;s voice came over the PA. 
&quot;All personnel to battle stations. All Veritech pilots scramble. 
Zentradi attack force inbound. This is not a drill, this is not a 
drill.&quot;

&quot;Alright, people,&quot; Ranma said jumping up. &quot;Party&#39;s over; let&#39;s get&#39;em in 
the air.&quot;

&quot;Aw, man,&quot; Ben said sadly, stuffing one last bite of his steak in his 
mouth before reluctantly following the others.

&quot;Oh my,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;That sounds serious.&quot;

&quot;Yes, it does,&quot; Nodoka agreed. &quot;I guess we should get ready for the 
wounded.&quot;

The two women paid for everyone and left the restaurant.

(oO\O/Oo)

As the Veritechs deployed and the Zentradi forces closed in, nobody 
noticed the lone Meltradi mecha slip in stealthily from the opposite 
direction. The pilot approached the SDF-1 and ripped open a hull plate, 
depositing a pod containing one micronized Meltradi assassin.

As the mecha restored the hull plate to its original position, Miriya 
Parino extricated herself from the pod and began her search of the 
Micronian that had humiliated her so.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Alright, people, here comes their fighter screen,&quot; Ranma said over the 
Tac-net. &quot;Break and engage. Stay with your wingman and cover each other. 
Good hunting.&quot;

Ranma and Akane went in and began to lay waste to the incoming Zentradi 
forces. Nearby, Max and Vicki were also flowing through the chaotic 
dance of death and fire. The battle was joined and slowly the defenders 
began to come out on top.

Unfortunately, behind the fighter screen came four Zentradi Destroyers. 
As the ships came into firing range, the SDF-1 deployed its new 
omni-directional barrier system and braced for the attack. Having 
reached maximum weapons range, the four destroyers opened fire on their 
target.

The globe shaped barrier boiled with hundreds of laser impacts set loose 
by the hellish barrage. Everyone, Zentradi and Human alike held their 
breath as the flashes from the impacts cleared. The SDF-1 remained. To 
the Zentradi dismay, it not only remained, but appeared undamaged.

&quot;Impossible!&quot; shrieked Kyron. &quot;There&#39;s no way they could withstand that 
barrage.&quot;

&quot;What are you orders, Lord Kyron?&quot; asked his second in command.

&quot;Keep firing,&quot; Kyron commanded, the light of bloodlust in his eyes. 
&quot;Keep firing until they have been obliterated!&quot;

Soon the four destroyers were firing as fast as their weapons could 
recharge.

&quot;Wild Rose Lead, this is Gunsight 1,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;The barrier system is 
beginning to lose power. You have to take those destroyers out. You&#39;re 
our only hope.&quot;

&quot;Roger, Gunsight 1,&quot; Ranma replied grimly.

&quot;Wild Rose Leader, the captain wanted me to tell you that the lives of 
everyone onboard are depending on you to destroy those ships,&quot; Lisa 
said.

&quot;Talk about a little pressure,&quot; Ranma smirked. &quot;Roger, Gunsight 1, we&#39;ll 
get it done. Wild Rose Lead to all Wild Rose and Skull flights. We have 
to take out those destroyers before they overload the barrier system. 
Alpha, we are taking the western most ship. Bravo, the next one over. 
Charlie, you have the eastern center ship. Skull, you have the eastern 
most. The rest of you keep the fighter screen off us. Let&#39;s get to it.&quot;

Ranma and her flight swept in and landed on the hull of the Zentradi 
ship in battloid mode. They, without much hope of doing enough damage to 
stop the ships quickly, began to take out the gun emplacement blisters 
along the hull. They had taken out nearly half the gun emplacements when 
Lisa came back over the Tac-net.

&quot;All squadrons, all squadrons, evacuate the area, evacuate the area,&quot; 
she said urgently. &quot;Proceed on a heading directly away from the SDF-1 at 
all available speed. Good luck.&quot;

&quot;Lisa, what&#39;s happening,&quot; Ranma demanded.

&quot;The barrier is going critical,&quot; Lisa said sadly. &quot;You have to get away. 
I love you.&quot;

&quot;Alright people you heard her, let&#39;s put as much distance as we can 
between us and that barrier,&quot; Ranma leaped off the destroyer&#39;s hull and 
firewalled the throttles as she shifted to fighter mode. Behind her 
Akane, Vicki, and Max matched her as they streaked away.

The barrier blew and a huge globe of hellfire expanded outward in all 
directions. Two screams were heard as the barrier caught up to two 
unfortunate Veritechs that weren&#39;t able to outrun the expanding ball of 
energy. All four of the destroyers were consumed and vaporized. The 
remaining Zentradi forces burned for orbit.

&quot;Skull Lead to Wild Rose Lead,&quot; Rick said grimly. &quot;We lost Ben Dixon, 
Ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Roger,&quot; Ranma acknowledged.

&quot;Wild Rose Nine to Wild Rose Lead,&quot; Natalia came over the squadron 
channel. &quot;Siren didn&#39;t make it.&quot;

&quot;Acknowledged,&quot; Ranma said somberly. &quot;Did we lose anyone else?&quot;

&quot;No, Mom,&quot; Marissa said. &quot;Everyone else made it.&quot;

&quot;Wild Rose Leader, this is Gunsight 1,&quot; Lisa came over the Tac-net, the 
grief clear in her voice. &quot;We survived the blast, but the area in a 25 
mile radius around us was completely destroyed.&quot;

It was left unsaid that they had been directly over a good-sized city. 
Now it looked like a flat plane of glass with a large crater in the 
center. Hundreds of thousands of people had been instantly turned to 
ash.

&quot;Roger, Gunsight 1,&quot; Ranma said in a subdued tone. &quot;Let the Captain know 
that we lost Cassandra Constantine and Ben Dixon.&quot;

&quot;Roger, I&#39;ll let him know,&quot; Lisa said as the remaining Veritechs headed 
back to the ship.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Rick Hunter, please pick up the yellow courtesy phone,&quot; the 
announcement penetrated Rick&#39;s daze. &quot;Rick Hunter, please pick up the 
yellow courtesy phone.&quot;

He sighed heavily and listlessly went to the phone, picking it up.

&quot;Hello, this is Rick Hunter,&quot; he said.

&quot;Oh Rick,&quot; a cheerful voice said on the other end of the line. &quot;I&#39;m so 
glad I found you. I thought you might have heard I was in the hospital. 
I just wanted you to know, I&#39;m okay. You don&#39;t have to worry. I was just 
exhausted, is all. Why don&#39;t you come up and see me. It&#39;ll be fun. We 
could play some games and...&quot;

Rick slowly hung the phone up and sighed heavily. Minmei&#39;s cheerful, 
carefree attitude wasn&#39;t something he felt like dealing with right now. 
Her inane prattle grated on his nerves as heavy thoughts filled his 
mind. She just didn&#39;t understand. Even though she had been on the ship 
the whole time, she didn&#39;t understand that people were dying around her. 
Christ, they had wiped out a whole city full of people and she wanted to 
play games and have a little party. He&#39;d lost one of his men and she 
wanted to have a good time.

&quot;You okay, Rick?&quot; Ranma asked, walking up to the somber young pilot. 
Rick closed his eyes and shook his head.

&quot;I just hung up on Minmei,&quot; Rick said emotionlessly.

&quot;You wanna talk about it?&quot; Ranma asked. &quot;Sometimes it helps.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Rick said. He didn&#39;t. Things just seemed so 
overwhelming.

&quot;It&#39;s hard losing members of your team,&quot; Ranma said softly. &quot;I know. 
I&#39;ve lost three of my original pilots now and I can tell you, it doesn&#39;t 
get easier. Losing the third is just as hard as loosing the first. All I 
can say is; you learn to move on. You honor their memory and you fight 
to avenge them, but you move on.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just so overwhelming,&quot; Rick said sounding lost. &quot;First what 
happened to Roy and now I&#39;ve lost Ben. How do you move on?&quot;

&quot;Well, the first part probably won&#39;t work for you,&quot; Ranma explained. &quot;We 
put their call sign on the tails of our planes and we have a good group 
cry and promise each other not to let their sacrifice be meaningless. 
Then we go get stupid drunk and celebrate the lives of those we lost.&quot;

&quot;The last part doesn&#39;t sound too bad,&quot; Rick said.

&quot;Then I say collect 8-ball and you guys can come with us when we go out 
for Cassie,&quot; Ranma suggested.

&quot;Okay,&quot; Rick agreed.

(oO\O/Oo)

Rick and Malcolm watched discreetly from the hanger deck door as the 
Wild Rose squadron reverently looked at the tails of their Veritechs and 
the three names that they now featured. Each woman and the one man 
seemed lost in their own thoughts. Some openly cried. Those tended to be 
the ones that knew all three of the people who were now memorialized on 
the Veritech tails.

Then by some unspoken signal, they came together in a big group hug and 
cried together. Even Max was included and even he had tears leaking from 
his eyes. Some of the women wept loudly as they other supported each 
other. It wasn&#146;t the last time that they would cry for their lost 
members that night, instead, it was just the beginning. As the tears 
subsided, then came the vows. Each woman and the one man vowed to make 
the Zentradi pay for taking their blood, and they each vowed to not let 
their sisters&#39; sacrifices be in vain.

&quot;Sometimes, women are lucky,&quot; Malcolm said softly to Rick as the Wild 
Roses broke up. &quot;That looked cathartic as hell.&quot;

&quot;It did,&quot; Rick agreed. &quot;But it&#39;s their way, not ours. We&#39;ll just have to 
be content with the second part of their mourning process. The part 
where we get pissed drunk and tell stories about Ben.&quot; He clapped the 
tall afro&#39;ed man on the shoulder.

&quot;I here ya,&quot; Malcolm shot him a weak smile as the women and Max joined 
them.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma staggered through the door of her quarters and headed for the 
bedroom, peeling off her uniform. She deposited it in the hamper and 
went to the dresser, pulling out a t-shirt. Taking off her bra, she 
slipped the t-shirt on and climbed into bed beside Lisa.

&quot;Did you get it all out of your system?&quot; Lisa asked sleepily.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ranma slurred slightly, hugging Lisa to her and tenderly 
stroking Lisa&#39;s gravid belly. &quot;I love you so much.&quot;

Lisa turned in her arms and kissed her with savage passion.

&quot;I love you to, Ranma,&quot; Lisa said, her voice heavy with emotion. &quot;I 
thought we were finished today. I&#39;m so glad you survived. I&#39;m so glad we 
survived.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Ranma said, kissing her hungrily. &quot;I don&#39;t know what I would 
have done without you.&quot;

Lisa smiled softly as she slipped her hand into Ranma&#39;s panties. For the 
next hour, the two women made desperate love to each other, feeling as 
if they were trying to merge into one being so that they would never be 
in danger of being separated.

(oO\O/Oo)

Minmei lay in her hospital room feeling very lost and confused. She 
didn&#39;t understand why Rick had hung up on her. It had hurt when he did 
that. It hurt a lot more than she could have imagined. She had cried for 
hours afterward. The worst part was that she didn&#39;t know why. Didn&#39;t he 
care about her anymore?

She rolled over restlessly, her red-rimmed eyes staring off into space 
as she tried to figure out what was going on.

&quot;Hello, Dear, how are you feeling today?&quot; an older nurse with deep red 
hair asked as she bustled in.

&quot;I&#39;m okay,&quot; Minmei said somberly. The nurse looked at her, taking in her 
depressed posture and her red-rimmed eyes.

&quot;Aw, honey, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; the nurse said coming over and sitting on the 
bed, stroking her hair gently.

&quot;H...he hung up on me and I don&#39;t know why,&quot; Minmei said, beginning to 
sob again as she sat up and hugged the nurse tightly.

&quot;It&#39;s alright, Dear,&quot; the nurse said soothingly. &quot;Who hung up on you?&quot;

&quot;M...my b...boyfriend,&quot; Minmei whimpered. &quot;He&#39;s a pilot. I had called 
him to tell him I was okay in case he was worried about me and he hung 
up on me.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s a pilot?&quot; the nurse asked.

&quot;Y...yes,&quot; Minmei said. &quot;He&#39;s a good one too. His name is Rick Hunter.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I met him yesterday when I was having lunch with my daughter, 
Ranma,&quot; Nodoka said. &quot;She&#39;s a pilot too.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re Ranma&#39;s mother?&quot; Minmei said in a bit of awe. &quot;Ranma is a good 
friend of mine. She&#39;s the one that gave me the chance to live my dream 
of being a singer. She won the Miss Macross pageant and gave me the 
recording contracts.&quot;

&quot;That was very sweet of her,&quot; Nodoka said. &quot;My name is Nodoka Saotome, 
but you can call me Auntie Nodoka if you want.&quot;

&quot;Okay Auntie,&quot; Minmei mewled. &quot;I just don&#39;t understand why Rick hung up 
on me.&quot;

&quot;Well, Dear, my daughter told me that he lost his first man in the 
battle yesterday,&quot; Nodoka said. &quot;She said he was very upset and was 
taking it badly.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Minmei asked softly.

&quot;A young man named Ben Dixon,&quot; Nodoka said.

&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Minmei whispered. &quot;He was a nice guy. A little...enthusiastic, 
but a nice guy. But why didn&#39;t Rick tell me?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, Dear,&quot; Nodoka said. &quot;Maybe he didn&#39;t want to trouble 
you.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Minmei said.

&quot;Warriors are like that, Sweetie,&quot; Nodoka said. &quot;They try to protect 
those they care about from the bad things in their world.&quot;

&quot;Their world?&quot; Minmei inquired.

&quot;Yes, Dear,&quot; Nodoka said. &quot;He lives in a different world than you. You 
live in a world where the worst thing you have to worry about is 
collapsing from exhaustion. In his world his life could end at any 
moment. The lives of his friends and those he&#39;s directly responsible for 
could end at any moment. Every time he goes out there&#39;s a chance that he 
or someone he&#39;s responsible for won&#39;t be coming back. That&#39;s his reality 
and it hit very close to him yesterday.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s horrible,&quot; Minmei whimpered. &quot;How can he do it?&quot;

&quot;Because he has to,&quot; Nodoka said. &quot;Because he wants to give people like 
you and me the chance to work ourselves to exhaustion, or have a good 
time, or to just live our lives without having to fear. My daughter, 
your boyfriend, all the men and women that defend this ship, all do it 
to protect us from the reality they go out to face everyday. They don&#39;t 
talk about it with us because we can never truly understand what it&#39;s 
like. We aren&#39;t part of that world.&quot;

Minmei looked deeply thoughtful. &quot;It all seems so petty when you put it 
that way,&quot; Minmei said. &quot;My career, my fame, all the fans,&quot; Minmei said 
softly. &quot;All the while those men and women are out there dying so that I 
can play. And all the while I&#39;m losing the man I love because I can&#39;t be 
a part of his world.&quot;

&quot;Maybe it is,&quot; Nodoka agreed, &quot;but that&#39;s why they do it, to give us a 
chance.&quot;

By the time Nodoka left the room, Minmei was deep in thought. She had to 
decide what she wanted. Now that she had a taste of the fame and the 
hectic lifestyle that stardom had brought her, she was slowly 
reconsidering her priorities. Fans and fame were great, but she couldn&#39;t 
help feeling lonely. It was a turning point for her. She had been asked, 
what seemed like so very long ago now, what she would do if she had to 
choose between her heart and her career. Now she faced that very choice.

Before she left the hospital, she had made a decision. She had thought 
of the couples she new of, including Roy Fokker and Claudia Grant, Lisa 
and Ranma, her other friends and their boyfriends. Of them, the military 
couples shared a closeness that she hadn&#39;t seen much in others. Her 
agent wasn&#39;t going to be happy with her decision, but she knew now what 
she wanted.

&#39;I want to be a part of your world, Rick,&#39; she thought to herself. &#39;I 
want to understand. I want to help. I want to be closer to you.&#39;

(oO\O/Oo)

June 2010...

&quot;You wanted to see us, Captain?&quot; Lisa asked as she and Ranma entered the 
office.

&quot;Yes, I have just received the orders we&#39;ve been expecting for some 
time,&quot; Captain Gloval said, his anger and frustration was clear in his 
voice. &quot;It was as we expected. We&#39;ve been ordered off the planet 
immediately.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;How will we tell the civilians?&quot;

&quot;Do you want me to make the announcement?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;No, thank you, Commander, but I couldn&#39;t do that to you again,&quot; Gloval 
said. &quot;This time I will tell them myself. Those bastards haven&#39;t an 
ounce of compassion.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll set up the press conference,&quot; Lisa said grimly.

&quot;We&#39;ll be there for support, Captain,&quot; Ranma said sympathetically.

(oO\O/Oo)

Gloval stood in front of a large stylized &#39;M&#39; as the cameras and 
microphones were positioned. The TV crew producer gave a countdown and 
then gave the captain the signal to begin as Lisa, Ranma, and Minmei 
stood off to the side watching.

&quot;Citizens of Macross City,&quot; Gloval began, &quot;as you know, the government 
has refused us permission to relocate the civilian population aboard 
this ship. I&#39;ve appealed this decision repeatedly in hope that they 
would reconsider. Unfortunately they have proven to be insensitive to 
your situation and as the captain of the SDF-1 it is my sad duty to 
inform you that this ship, including all its passengers, has been 
ordered to leave Earth immediately. I have been informed that if we fail 
to comply, then we will be attacked by elements of our own defense 
forces. This cannot be allowed to happen. So it is with great reluctance 
that I must comply with the orders. I&#39;m so very sorry that you have all 
been dragged into this; but now more than ever, we need your 
cooperation. I...I&#39;m sorry...&quot;

The captain might have said more, but he was overcome with his emotions 
and placed his hand over his face pinching the bridge of his nose as his 
shoulders shook. The three women watching each had tears in their eyes 
as they watched a man endure the unendurable.

Suddenly Minmei rushed to the Captain&#39;s side, dragging Ranma by the 
hand.

&quot;It&#39;s alright, Captain, we know you did your best for us,&quot; Minmei 
comforted him. She turned and addressed the cameras. &#148;I don&#146;t understand 
anything that has to do with politics, but I do know that the only way 
we&#146;ll survive this is to pull together&#133; I think of the SDF-1 as my home 
now. We&#146;ve been through a lot together, but look at how strong we&#146;ve 
become because of it. I have way more friends here than I ever did on 
Earth. You&#146;ve been like a big family to me. Someday we&#146;ll return to 
Earth. We&#146;ll never give up hope. But for now, I&#146;m proud to be a citizen 
of Macross City and this ship.

&quot;Furthermore, I would like to take this opportunity to tell everyone 
that I&#39;ve made a decision. I plan to join the RDF and help the brave men 
and women of the crew to protect this ship and all its people. I don&#39;t 
plan to give up singing, but I feel that this is something I have to do 
to help out.

&quot;Miss Macross and I will now sing for you,&quot; Minmei said, stepping close 
to Ranma. &quot;We would like to dedicate this new song, &#39;The Power of Love&#39;, 
to everyone aboard the SDF-1.&quot; She gave Ranma a wink and Ranma nodded 
her acceptance.

The music started in an upbeat fast paced piano lead-in that was joined 
by other instruments at each measure. On cue, Minmei began to sing with 
Ranma providing back up vocals during the chorus and singing the second 
verse.

There comes a time

when you face the toughest of fights

searching for a sign

lost in the darkest of nights

the wind blows so cold

(you&#39;re) standing alone

before the battle&#39;s begun

but deep in your soul

the future unfolds

as bright as the rays of the sun

You&#39;ve got to believe

in the power of love

you&#39;ve got to believe

in the power of love

Blazing emotions

there&#39;s a light, that flows from your heart

it&#39;s a chain reaction

and nothing will keep us apart

Stand by my side

there&#39;s nothing to hide

together, we&#39;ll fight to the end

take hold of my hand

and you&#39;ll understand

what it truly means to be friends

You&#39;ve got to believe

in the power of love

you&#39;ve got to believe

in the power of love

it gives meaning to each moment

it&#39;s what our hearts are all made of

You&#39;ve got to believe, in the power of love

The power of love

You&#39;ve got to believe

in the power of love

you&#39;ve got to believe

in the power of love

it gives meaning to each moment

it&#39;s what our hearts are all made of

You&#39;ve got to believe, in the power of love

The power of love

(oO\O/Oo)

Out in the streets, the outraged and saddened people were moved by 
Minmei&#39;s speech and many began to feel a sense of pride in being aboard 
the SDF-1. They felt a sense of solidarity with each other and found the 
strength in their newfound sense of community to endure leaving Earth 
once more.

Many were enraptured by the song and began to sing along with it. It 
gave them a sense of hope and joy that they needed at this time.

Seated in a fighter, on ready alert status, watching the broadcast on 
his cockpit monitor, was a stunned young man. He wasn&#39;t stunned about 
the order, nor was he stunned about the song. He was stunned about the 
announcement that had preceded the song.

&quot;Minmei&#39;s joining the RDF?&quot; Rick said to himself. &quot;She&#39;s giving up her 
career to become a soldier? Why did she decide that?&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Three men, known as Rico, Konda, and Bron, listened to Minmei&#39;s 
impassioned speech from the comm unit aboard their battle pod. They were 
going to miss life in Macross City. They listened to Minmei and Ranma&#39;s 
song wistfully, wondering if they would ever hear such a wonderful thing 
again. They would also miss Mistress Bertha who had trained them sternly 
but caringly and allowed them to find Mistress Sammy, Mistress Vanessa, 
and Mistress Kim, to whom they were sold to at the party. They would 
miss serving the four women and felt terribly guilty about abandoning 
them.

As their sensors reported the pick up ship swinging low through the 
upper reaches of the atmosphere, the three spies launched the pod 
section of their battle pod and were picked up.

(oO\O/Oo)

As the song played, the SDF-1 began to rise out of the ocean and ascend 
through the atmosphere. Even as they achieved orbit and prepared for 
their run through the blockading ships, a huge space fold was detected 
as one million Zentradi ships entered the system at a point somewhere 
behind the Moon.
