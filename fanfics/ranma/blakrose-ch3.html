<h1>Black Rose, Blue Thunder (part 3 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/blakrose-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>	Nabiki worked her way through the large crowd of 
people gathered in the front yard to Furinkan high curious as to 
what exactly they were looking at. 

	&quot;I hope Akane&#39;s not sunbathing again,&quot; said Nabiki 
lowly. &quot;She started a riot last time she did that.&quot; 

	After a minute she finally pushed her way through the 
crowd and was able to see what had captured their attention. 

	It was Ranma and Kodachi lounging underneath the 
large oak tree in the front yard. Actually it was more like 
Kodachi lounging in Ranma&#39;s lap than anything else. The couple 
were involved in a very heated kiss that probably would have 
gone on for quite some time if Nabiki hadn&#39;t walked up to them 
and coughed loudly. 

	Pulling away slowly Ranma poked his dark head around 
Kodachi and grinned. &quot;Nabchan,&quot; he said sensuously. &quot;I thought 
that was you. Wanna join in?&quot; 

	&quot;No!&quot; Nabiki replied hastily as she turned bright red. 
&quot;No, no, no!&quot; Calming herself Nabiki averted her gaze and 
scowled. &quot;What are you two doing anyway? Don&#39;t you know 
that romantic interaction is against school rules?&quot; 

	&quot;A pity,&quot; purred Kodachi. She smoothly curled out of 
Ranma&#39;s lap to lay draped on his side. &quot;May I ask why that is? It 
seems like such a stifling rule to enforce.&quot; 

	&quot;Yeah, well,&quot; said Nabiki slowly still refusing to meet 
the couple&#39;s eyes. &quot;It&#39;s all because of Akane.&quot; 

	&quot;Akane?&quot; questioned Ranma, his cobalt eyes gleaming 
with predatory interest. &quot;What about her?&quot; 

	&quot;They sort of caught her... you know,&quot; said Nabiki as she 
flushed an even redder hue. &quot;When her fan club found out about 
it they sort of destroyed the school in their misery. The school 
officials decided after that it was safer for Akane and anyone 
else not to kiss on school grounds. Hence the rule.&quot; 

	&quot;They destroyed the school?&quot; asked Ranma in skeptic 
tones. He studied the lavish buildings Furinkan possessed and 
the many floors they had and said, &quot;It looks okay to me.&quot; 

	Scratching the back of her head Nabiki sheepishly said, 
&quot;They did repairs. Besides, they didn&#39;t destroy all of the 
buildings anyway. It was just the north gym and locker rooms 
since that was where she got caught.&quot; 

	&quot;So,&quot; Kodachi murmured with a smile. &quot;Akane is the 
adventuresome sort. How intriguing.&quot; 

	&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; said Ranma, matching her smile. He looked 
back to Nabiki then continued, &quot;I&#39;ve been meaning to ask you 
how this place got so plush. I haven&#39;t ever seen any high school 
this decked out. How do they afford it?&quot; 

	&quot;Akane again,&quot; said Nabiki with a wry smile. &quot;My 
Imotochan is famous in the athletics community and there are 
hundreds of people who want to sponsor her. She can&#39;t take on 
sponsors since she&#39;s still underage and isn&#39;t a professional athlete 
yet. So instead they give their bribes to the school and we end 
up with all these pretty buildings.&quot; 

	Upon hearing this Ranma and Kodachi exchanged a look 
of certain wicked intentions while Nabiki observed them warily. 
&quot;Okay,&quot; she pronounced carefully. &quot;What scam are you planning 
now?&quot; 

	&quot;Scam?&quot; Ranma repeated innocently. 

	&quot;Whatever do you mean?&quot; Kodachi continued as she 
formed an equally innocent expression. &quot;Aren&#39;t we allowed to be 
curious about some events? Not all our interests are of the 
business nature Nabiki dearest.&quot; 

	&quot;Somehow I doubt that,&quot; replied Nabiki dryly. 

	Ranma was about to make a reply when suddenly the 
automatic sprinkler system turned on causing Kodachi to now be 
draped on the figure of a gorgeous female elf. 

	&quot;That was most inopportune,&quot; noted Kodachi as she spat 
out some of the water that had also hit her in the face. 

	&quot;Got that right,&quot; Ranma said sourly. She then hastily 
pushed her wet blonde bangs out of her eyes. &quot;I didn&#39;t want 
anyone to know about my curse until we came up with some 
way that we could profit from it.&quot; Looking to the crowd of 
students Ranma continued, &quot;Do you think they noticed the 
change? Dachi was sorta blocking me.&quot; 

	Before Nabiki could reply a thunderous crash sounded 
and they looked to see that the entire crowd of students had 
simultaneously fainted. 

	Nabiki watched this and said wryly, &quot;They noticed.&quot; 

--- 

	Entering the smoky bar Soun reached for his pack of 
cigarettes as he said, &quot;Is there some reason that we&#39;re coming 
here every night, Saotome? We never order drinks.&quot; 

	&quot;It&#39;s very simple Tendo,&quot; said Genma gravely while he 
took his place at their usual booth. &quot;This bar doesn&#39;t have the 
dojo&#39;s ears.&quot; 

	&quot;Ears?&quot; Soun asked in confusion. 

	&quot;Ears,&quot; confirmed Genma. He leaned across the table and 
continued, &quot;That son of mine is a clever one. Too clever at 
times. We can&#39;t let him know too much.&quot; 

	&quot;Know too much?&quot; repeated Soun again. While he lit his 
cigarette he rewarded Genma with a skeptical look. &quot;What are 
you talking about? All we do here is conduct idle chatter. Why 
would Ranma be interested in that?&quot; 

	&quot;Ah, but knowledge is power,&quot; said Genma wisely. &quot;And 
my boy has enough of that already.&quot; 

	&quot;Enough what?&quot; asked Soun blankly. 

	Scowling slightly Genma replied, &quot;Power! He has 
enough power already Tendo.&quot; 

	&quot;Nonsense,&quot; Soun dismissed with a wave of his hand. 
&quot;Ranma&#39;s a teenager. What sort of power could he possibly have 
at his age? You worry too much Saotome.&quot; 

	&quot;You say that now,&quot; said Genma lowly. &quot;But wait until 
the trouble starts. It always starts soon after we arrive. Usually 
within the week but they&#39;ve been lucky this time.&quot; 

	&quot;Mmm hmm,&quot; said Soun as he blew smoke rings and 
averted his eyes to the ceiling of the bar. Whenever Genma 
would go into his rambling speeches about his son Soun tended 
to phase out of the conversation. 

	&quot;If only my eldest were here,&quot; Genma droned on. &quot;If he 
was here I wouldn&#39;t have anything to worry about.&quot; 

	&quot;Your eldest?&quot; Soun suddenly turned his attention back 
to his friend. &quot;You have another son?&quot; 

	&quot;Of course I have another son!&quot; exclaimed Genma as his 
scowl returned. &quot;I told you that in my postcard!&quot; 

	Soun could only blink at this revelation. Finally he 
snapped out of his daze and asked, &quot;Where is he?&quot; 

	Sighing deeply, Genma replied, &quot;Lost.&quot; 

--- 

	Sapphire eyes narrowed with cool decision. One of her 
targets had come into clear view and they were finally located in 
an area deserted of people. It had taken some time to get them 
alone. And alone was necessary because it meant a lack of 
witnesses. 

	The last thing that she wanted was witnesses. 

	&quot;&lt;Demon thief.&gt;&quot; 

	A snarl curling on her lips the Amazon Enforcer of 
Joketsuzoku, known as Perfume, rose to her feet and produced 
one of her double bladed axes in her grip. With deadly precision 
she hurled the axe at her target who had stopped to gaze at 
something on the street. 

	&quot;&lt;Die.&gt;&quot; 

--- 

	Kneeling down to pick up the hundred yen piece she&#39;d 
seen Kodachi blinked at the gust of air she felt pass over the 
back of her neck. Rising to her former height she stared at the 
fire hydrant wildly gushing water with some curiosity. 

	&quot;How odd,&quot; murmured Kodachi as she slipped the yen 
piece into her pocket. With a shrug she continued on her way 
back to the Tendo dojo not even bothering to make a closer 
study of the hydrant. A study which would have led her to 
discover the axe imbedded deep within it. 

--- 

	Perfume stared in certain horror as the powerful rush of 
pressurized cold water flew across the street and directly at her 
perched position on top a nearby street light. The instant the 
cold water hit her form she shrank and her silken Chinese 
pantsuit fell to the street below. 

	In her place was the brightly glowing bulbous form that 
on closer inspection was in reality the figure of a small winged 
pixie. Perfume tried to scowl but her ultra kawaii looks wouldn&#39;t 
allow it so instead she placed her hands on her hips in an 
irritated manner. Seconds later she spewed forth a series of 
vulgarities that came out sounding like melodic bells that were 
very pleasing to the ear. 

	Shaking her golden head Perfume kicked the air with her 
green boot covered in a white powder puff at the end and in 
doing this some sparkle filled dust followed her action. She then 
sniffed in agitation before she flew off after the departing 
Kodachi. As she did so she left a trail of sparkling dust behind 
her as more bell sounds followed her speedy exit. 

	It seemed that killing them wasn&#39;t going to be as easy as 
she thought it would be. 

--- 

	Bringing up the spreadsheet Nabiki leaned back in her 
chair and exchanged a smile with Ranma. &quot;Charging for an 
explanation on your curse has helped us exceed all our profit 
calculations for the week,&quot; she said proudly. 

	It had been an hour since school had let out so Ranma 
and Nabiki were relaxing as they usually did. By calculating the 
profits of the day. 

	&quot;Excellent,&quot; said Ranma in low charming tones. He 
scooted his chair forward to study the screen closer. &quot;I just knew 
it would work. People are curious by nature and they were 
willing to pay any price to get their answers.&quot; 

	&quot;True,&quot; murmured Nabiki in agreement. She stared at the 
computer screen and continued, &quot;We sold quite a few pictures 
too. Mostly of you and Dachi. A lot of the girls at our school 
seem to have fixated on you Ranma.&quot; 

	&quot;Mmm,&quot; said Ranma thoughtfully. Resting his chin on 
the palm of his hand he continued slyly, &quot;I&#39;m just the perfect 
figure of masculinity. Aren&#39;t I?&quot; 

	&quot;Obnoxious much?&quot; said Nabiki teasingly. &quot;But you&#39;re 
right. They do seem to find you attractive.&quot; Forming a face of 
mock disgust she stuck her tongue out at him. &quot;Don&#39;t ask me 
why.&quot; 

	&quot;Oh!&quot; cried Ranma in exaggeration as he clutched his 
chest as if he&#39;d been shot. &quot;You wound me to my very soul! 
Why do the ones we love always hurt us so?&quot; 

	&quot;Idiot,&quot; said Nabiki fondly. &quot;Stop playing with me.&quot; 

	His cobalt eyes darkened and drawing closer Ranma 
smiled and Nabiki shivered from feeling his breath hit her skin. 
&quot;Do I have to? I like playing with you Nabchan.&quot; 

	&quot;As do I,&quot; purred Kodachi from the open doorway to 
Nabiki&#39;s room she was leaning against. &quot;I take it that we had 
quite the impressive profit margin today?&quot; 

	&quot;We exceeded all our projections,&quot; said Nabiki while she 
quickly moved away from Ranma&#39;s magnetic presence. 

	&quot;Indeed?&quot; Kodachi quirked a raven eyebrow. &quot;Well,&quot; she 
said mischievously. &quot;I think we ought to celebrate such an event. 
Don&#39;t you Ranma darling?&quot; 

	&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; said Ranma smiling. Rising to his feet he 
grasped Kodachi&#39;s waist and pulled her to him. &quot;I say we go 
clubbing. We haven&#39;t done that in awhile Dachi.&quot; 

	&quot;An excellent idea my dearest,&quot; said Kodachi in 
sensuous tones. Looking to Nabiki she continued, &quot;You&#39;ll be 
joining us of course Nabiki darling.&quot; 

	&quot;Clubbing?&quot; repeated Nabiki skeptically. &quot;I don&#39;t know 
you two. I have a lot of homework...&quot; 

	&quot;Pish posh,&quot; dismissed Kodachi with a wave of her hand. 
&quot;Then do it now. I simply refuse to accept no for an answer.&quot; 
She formed a sly expression and said, &quot;We could use this time to 
find you some handsome male suitors.&quot; 

	&quot;No thanks,&quot; Nabiki said dryly. &quot;I&#39;m perfectly able to 
find handsome male suitors on my own Dachi. And besides that, 
my love life is doing just fine without your help.&quot; 

	As they exchanged a humorous look between them 
Ranma and Kodachi said, &quot;Right.&quot; 

--- 

	With quiet ease Perfume landed on the window sill and 
inspected the small opening as the window wasn&#39;t fully closed. 
Narrowing her eyes Perfume lay her tiny body down on the 
wooden surface and wriggled under the window until she was 
inside Tendo Nabiki&#39;s bedroom. 

	Both her targets were here along with their business 
partner. Apparently going through their profits like the blood 
thirsty sharks that they were. Her brow furrowing in anger 
Perfume formed a tiny snarl on her tanned features as she 
pushed off the window sill and flew forward to gain a better 
vantage point in the room. 

	Unfortunately for Perfume as she did this she caught the 
attention of an always observant Nabiki. 

	&quot;A bug!&quot; exclaimed Nabiki as she eyed the brightly 
glowing object flying across her room. 

	&quot;A bug?&quot; repeated Ranma. Studying the suddenly frozen 
creature he looked to Nabiki who was pale for some reason. 
&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; 

	&quot;I hate bugs,&quot; Nabiki said with disgust. 

	&quot;Then we shall have to get rid of it,&quot; said Kodachi. 

	Perfume froze in sudden unexpected fear as the giant 
violet ribbon flew towards her at a mammoth pace. Her body 
seared with pain as her miniature form collapsed to the ground. 
Shaking as the pain invaded her system and filled her thoughts 
completely Perfume could barely access Kodachi&#39;s giant 
lumbering frame over her when a thick gooey liquid fell upon 
her. Struggling against the goo Perfume could no longer move 
as the noxious fumes filled her lungs and it was then that her 
prone form was scooped up in a downy white covering. Barely 
keeping consciousness Perfume protested her situation with a 
series of vulgar outbursts. 

	Suddenly she was falling and panic gripping her mind 
Perfume tried to struggle against the thick wrapping but she 
couldn&#39;t break free. Instead she was met with a harsh landing 
and her mind noted with some curiosity that when she did land 
there had been a splash. Slowly water dripped into the covering 
and began to free Perfume from her gooey prison but then the 
loud sound of thunder met her ears. Her eyes widened as a giant 
whirlpool swept her into its volatile wrath. Releasing a series of 
wild protests Perfume futilely struggled against the current but it 
was too late. She was soon carried under and as she was dragged 
away the last thing that she saw was Ranma closing the toilet 
lid. 

--- 

	&quot;C&#39;mon you guys,&quot; said Akane with a slight huff in her 
breath as she jogged far ahead of the rest of her fellow 
basketball players. &quot;I haven&#39;t seen anyone move this slow since 
our last game against Crossroads. Don&#39;t tell me that you&#39;re 
turning into zombies like them? And we don&#39;t even have youma 
attacks for an excuse to slack off.&quot; 

	&quot;Captain,&quot; heaved her fellow forward Sugo Yumi. &quot;Can&#39;t 
we hit the showers already? We&#39;ve been practicing for nearly 
three hours.&quot; 

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; chimed in Wubei Tahashi, who was often called 
the queen of the jumpshots by the press. &quot;It&#39;s just a pre-game. 
There&#39;s no reason to get so worked up.&quot; 

	At this comment Akane paused in her jog and turned 
around to face the rest of the team. Over the din of silence the 
low murmur of, &quot;Now you&#39;ve done it,&quot; could be heard. 

	&quot;Uhm...&quot; began Tahashi nervously. &quot;I was only saying... 
I mean... I didn&#39;t...&quot; Meeting solemn light brown eyes Tahashi 
swallowed the lump in her throat before she fell to her knees and 
cried out, &quot;Gomen nasai Akane-sama!&quot; 

	Sighing at this Akane knelt down next to Tahashi and 
said, &quot;It&#39;s okay. I know how frustrating it is to practice so much 
but it&#39;s how we maintain our skills while improving them. You 
do understand that right?&quot; Tahashi nodded rapidly at this and 
now smiling Akane murmured, &quot;That&#39;s good.&quot; She gently helped 
Tahashi to her feet and then looked to the rest of the team. &quot;I 
also know that there&#39;s no sense in practicing when our bodies are 
already run down. What do you say we try out the newly 
installed Jacuzzis at the training center?&quot; 

	&quot;Jacuzzis?&quot; repeated the basketball players. Meeting 
each others gazes the same thought popped into most of their 
minds on hearing this suggestion... 

	It was a chance to see Akane naked. 

	Oh sure they had seen her naked before but it was an 
experience one liked to have again... and again and again and 
again and then some more. The response was instantaneous and 
before Akane had a chance to reply the entire Furinkan girls 
basketball team disappeared in a cloud of dust towards their 
school&#39;s illustrious sports training center. 

	Akane watched this with wide eyes and shaking her head 
she wryly commented, &quot;And here I thought they were actually 
tired.&quot; With a sigh Akane took after them in a burst of blurring 
speed. &quot;Wait for me you doofs!&quot; 

--- 

	The dizzy flight of a winged pixie covered in toxic 
substances and other things too disgusting to mention was not 
noticed by the busy citizens of Nerima as they went about their 
daily business. This was the one of two things that Perfume was 
feeling grateful for. More attention would once again get her 
into trouble with people who were kill happy when it came to 
&#39;bugs&#39; like herself. The other thing that she was grateful for was 
the fact that there appeared to be a sports center of some sort 
across the street. Perfume could practically feel the hot water 
hitting her skin as she fluttered carefully across the street and 
towards the building. 

	That was when the gang of sweaty girls wearing 
basketball uniforms ran into her. Well, it was more like one 
player in particular ran into her. A player with very nice but 
sadly restrained breasts. After the aforementioned breasts ran 
into her Perfume fell to the ground only to nearly be smashed by 
the rest of the players. 

	Somehow managing to remain unscathed Perfume lifted 
her weary blonde head at the loud thump made by the shoe as it 
stepped right next to her. She quickly grabbed onto one of the 
loose laces to the sneaker and allowed herself to be dragged into 
the building. 

	When the girl stopped to get undressed in the locker 
rooms Perfume rested on the ground and contemplated her 
situation in silent rage. She would get her revenge upon both the 
demon thieves and their evil accomplice. How dare they do 
something so humiliating to an Enforcer of Joketsuzoku! 

	Twitching Perfume couldn&#39;t help but spew forth yet 
another series of vulgarities which, as always, sounded like 
melodic bells. Grimacing at this Perfume cursed the damned 
kawaii form that she was stuck with. It made her job nearly 
impossible to do at times since many dared to question her skill 
as a fighter all because she turned into a &#39;cute little pixie.&#39; 

	Still seething Perfume slowly floated into the air to hang 
onto the bottom of the towel that was loosely pulled around the 
girl&#39;s athletic frame. It was a very nice frame she noticed. Too 
bad she didn&#39;t have time for sight seeing for the entire place was 
filled with nice frames. When they finally entered the bathhouse 
Perfume wondered about the strange pool that was filled with 
bubbles but shrugged off her worries. It was bubbling so that 
meant it was hot and right now all she wanted was to submerge 
herself into the water then leave in her human form to get her 
revenge. 

	So without further ado Perfume dove into the strange 
bubbling water to emerge across from the girl who had, quite 
literally, brought her here. Her companion wore a look of shock 
upon seeing her and narrowing her eyes at this Perfume did the 
only thing she could do in a situation like this. 

	She retrieved a new pair of double bladed axes and 
demanded to know her exact location. 

--- 

	Akane blinked as the buxom girl who had appeared out 
of thin air produced a pair of axes and demanded in rather stilted 
Japanese, &quot;Where we? Is still Nerima?&quot; 

	&quot;Yes,&quot; began Akane slowly as she studied the girl 
closely. &quot;You&#39;re still in Nerima. But you&#39;re inside the Furinkan 
High&#39;s sports training center to be more specific.&quot; Tilting her 
head to one side she asked curiously, &quot;Are you lost?&quot; 

	&quot;Not lost,&quot; the girl replied shortly while sapphire eyes 
studied the other occupants of the Jacuzzi suspiciously. &quot;Am on 
mission. Lose way but never lost. Amazon Enforcer never get 
lost. Is shameful if so.&quot; 

	&quot;You&#39;re an Amazon?&quot; asked Akane, looking intrigued. 

	&quot;Yes,&quot; said the girl with a curt nod. &quot;Am a Chinese 
Amazon from village of Joketsuzoku. Name is Perfume.&quot; 

	&quot;Nice to meet you Perfume,&quot; said Akane with a smile. 
&quot;My name is Tendo Akane and these,&quot; she paused to gesture to 
the surrounding girls. &quot;Are my fellow teammates of the Lady 
Destroyers of Furinkan high.&quot; 

	&quot;Tendo Akane?&quot; repeated Perfume as her eyes narrowed. 
&quot;This your name?&quot; 

	&quot;Since I was born,&quot; Akane said playfully. 

	Mulling over this all was silent in the steaming room 
until Perfume abruptly rose in the Jacuzzi to her full height and 
revealed all of her rather curvaceous assets. While everyone was 
gaping at the Amazon&#39;s perfect figure in mixed awe and lust 
Akane was focused on something else. The light brown sheen 
that covered Perfume&#39;s body and the stench that rose from her 
skin. It occurred to her that it was quite ironic that a girl with a 
name like Perfume could smell so badly. 

	&quot;I need talk to your kin,&quot; said Perfume. &quot;Name is Tendo 
Nabiki. You take me to her now.&quot; 

	&quot;My Oneechan?&quot; said Akane. &quot;Why do you want to see 
her?&quot; 

	&quot;Is business,&quot; replied Perfume tightly. 

	Blinking at this Akane shrugged and said, &quot;I guess that 
makes sense. Okay, I&#39;ll take you to her.&quot; Akane then followed 
suit and rose out of the Jacuzzi to give their gaping audience 
even more flesh to ogle. Grasping the Enforcer&#39;s shoulder to stop 
her from walking any further Akane said hesitantly, &quot;There&#39;s just 
two things...&quot; 

	Turning around on feeling a gentle hand grasp her 
shoulder Perfume wondered why she felt so at ease with this girl 
who was the sister of her enemy. &quot;What?&quot; 

	&quot;First,&quot; said Akane as she took Perfume&#39;s hand in her 
own. &quot;We get you all cleaned up and smelling nicer.&quot; 

	Perfume turned bright red as she noticed the stench 
rising from her body for the first time. &quot;Okay,&quot; she agreed a bit 
embarrassed. &quot;What second?&quot; 

	&quot;The second thing is we get you some clothes,&quot; said 
Akane smiling. With a friendly tug of her hand she then pulled 
Perfume along after her. 

	The pair soon disappeared from the general view of the 
Jacuzzi occupants and when they did there was a general feeling 
of disappointment tinged with envy for the latest focus of 
Akane&#39;s attention. 

--- 

	&quot;So,&quot; began Akane with a smile. &quot;What sort of business 
do you have with my Oneechan?&quot; 

	&quot;Private business,&quot; said Perfume shortly. 

	Once Perfume had bathed and been given one of Akane&#39;s 
spare basketball uniforms to wear the two girls left for the 
Tendo dojo. Currently they were leisurely making their way 
through downtown Nerima and Perfume was finding it 
increasingly difficult to avoid answering Akane&#39;s questions. The 
girl was so damned friendly that it somehow made her 
impossibly likable. 

	Apparently, thought Perfume wryly as she observed 
several people walk into each other as their eyes were locked on 
Akane, I&#39;m not the only one to notice it. 

	Akane released a sigh. &quot;I guess you&#39;re the strong and 
silent type, huh?&quot; Her light brown eyes twinkling Akane wore 
an shrewd expression as she said, &quot;Sometimes that can be really 
attractive in a person. Sometimes... but not now. Right now it&#39;s 
rather annoying.&quot; 

	Freezing in her place Perfume narrowed her sapphire 
gaze as Akane whistled and skipped on ahead of her. After a few 
moments she turned and smiled widely. 

	&quot;Aww,&quot; said Akane teasingly as she placed her hands on 
her slim hips. &quot;Don&#39;t be like that Perfume. It was only a joke. 
Don&#39;t you have those back in China?&quot; 

	Rolling her eyes Perfume walked past the other girl and 
smiling she said, &quot;Yes. But not bad ones like that.&quot; 

	&quot;Hey!&quot; Akane cried indignantly as she rushed after 
Perfume. &quot;I resemble that!&quot; 

	The gathering crowd of shoppers watched the pair depart 
into the suburban area of Nerima and the voice of Akane was 
heard to smugly say, &quot;I finally got you talking though. That&#39;s got 
to count for something.&quot; 

--- 

	&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Nabiki a bit nervously as she looked 
at the large shopping bag she held. &quot;Did I really need to buy a 
new outfit just to go out clubbing?&quot; 

	&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Kodachi in lofty tones. She gave Nabiki 
a coy smile as she tossed her raven hair over one shoulder. &quot;We 
want you looking your best.&quot; 

	&quot;Yeah Nabchan,&quot; Ranma chimed in with a smirk. &quot;You 
need to bait the hook to catch the fish.&quot; 

	Narrowing her hazel eyes Nabiki asked, &quot;What fish and 
why do I need bait?&quot; 

	&quot;Now, now,&quot; Kodachi said in soothing tones as she 
patted Nabiki&#39;s arm. &quot;Don&#39;t get upset. We&#39;re merely trying to 
help with your romantic troubles.&quot; 

	&quot;What romantic troubles?&quot; retorted Nabiki. 

	&quot;Don&#39;t feign ignorance,&quot; said Kodachi. She hooked her 
arm in Nabiki&#39;s and continued, &quot;We know better.&quot; 

	&quot;You know what?&quot; asked Nabiki with increasing 
annoyance. &quot;What are you both up to now?&quot; 

	&quot;It&#39;s simple,&quot; said Ranma smoothly as he shot her a 
charming smile. &quot;We&#39;re going to help you land a man.&quot; 

	There was a moment of silence before Nabiki blinked 
before she roared, &quot;You&#39;re what?!&quot; 

--- 

	A few blocks away Perfume frowned as she heard a 
shout echo throughout Nerima. Standing next to her, Akane 
looked around quickly as she said, &quot;Oneechan?&quot; 

	Giving Akane a sharp look Perfume asked, &quot;That was 
battle cry of your sister?&quot; 

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Akane slowly. &quot;That was Nabiki all right 
but I don&#39;t know it if was a battle cry. It sounded more like a 
death sentence to me.&quot; 

	&quot;Tendo Nabiki,&quot; hissed Perfume, her sapphire eyes 
narrowing decisively. &quot;Demon thieves. I find you all.&quot; 

	In an abrupt movement Perfume grabbed Akane&#39;s hand 
in her own then took off in the direction of the shout. This time 
she would not let her targets escape. 

--- 

	Nabiki was slowly stalking towards her business partners 
who wore innocent expressions on their faces as they met her 
burning gaze. 

	&quot;You seem unduly upset, Nabiki dearest,&quot; said Kodachi. 
&quot;Why is that?&quot; 

	&quot;Say it again,&quot; hissed Nabiki. 

	&quot;Say what?&quot; asked Ranma with a playful smile. 

	&quot;Say what you&#39;re planning!&quot; Nabiki shouted. 

	Meeting their eyes the couple shrugged then Kodachi 
said, &quot;We plan on helping you find a boyfriend of sorts.&quot; 

	&quot;Or a boy toy if you want,&quot; added Ranma slyly. 

	Her left eye twitching Nabiki said, &quot;That&#39;s what I thought 
you said.&quot; She took in a deep calming breath before she snarled, 
&quot;What makes you think I need help with that?!&quot; 

	&quot;Your lack of dates,&quot; began Kodachi. 

	&quot;The way all the guys at school hide from you,&quot; 
continued Ranma. 

	&quot;And your repressed nature,&quot; finished Kodachi. 

	There was another pause as Nabiki gaped at the couple 
before she roared, &quot;I am not repressed!!&quot; 

--- 

	Across the street, Akane observed as her older sister 
continued her ranting at the couple. Frowning at this she tried to 
figure out why Nabiki was so upset but soon gave up on the 
task. Her Oneechan got upset about a lot of things. 

	&quot;Oneechan! Nabiki!&quot; called Akane loudly. 

	Just as her sister turned to face her way a large truck 
passed in front of them and caused the puddle of water in the 
street to splash upwards. Akane escaped dry but Perfume was 
another matter. 

	Buried underneath her mound of clothes the Enforcer 
cursed her bad luck and vowed that despite her current state she 
wasn&#39;t going to lose her targets again. 

--- 

	When the truck passed Nabiki looked at Akane who 
stood across the street. Akane was glancing around wearing a 
confused expression. 

	&quot;Perfume?&quot; Akane said, shading her eyes. &quot;Perfume! 
Where did you go? My Oneechan is here!&quot; 

	&quot;Uhm... Akane?&quot; said Nabiki slowly as she walked 
towards her younger sister. &quot;Why are you calling out for some 
perfume?&quot; 

	Turning to her sister Akane rolled her eyes. &quot;Silly. I met 
a girl named Perfume. She wanted to talk to you but now she&#39;s 
gone... I swear she was here only a moment ago.&quot; 

	&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; said Nabiki skeptically. &quot;Are you back on 
those iron supplement pills again?&quot; 

	&quot;That&#39;s not funny!&quot; declared Akane huffily. Whirling 
around she headed towards the dojo as she muttered, &quot;Why 
doesn&#39;t anyone believe me? I know she was here. I saw her 
naked for the Kami&#39;s sake! Had a gorgeous body...&quot; 

	&quot;She&#39;s definitely taking those pills again,&quot; affirmed 
Nabiki to herself. &quot;They always made her a bit loopy.&quot; She 
turned back to where her business partners were and instead 
found the street deserted. &quot;Cowards,&quot; she said with a scowl. 
With a grumble she decided to head back home. &quot;Repressed 
nature my butt. I&#39;m not repressed.&quot; 

--- 

	&quot;Man,&quot; said Ranma lowly. &quot;She sure has a temper on 
her. It&#39;s pretty damn scary.&quot; 

	The couple had wisely taken Nabiki&#39;s distraction with 
Akane as a chance to escape from her wrath. Currently they 
were perched on a high telephone pole watching the middle 
Tendo sister head back towards the dojo. 

	&quot;Quite,&quot; said Kodachi with a nod. &quot;I think that Nabiki 
dearest needs our help even more desperately than I thought.&quot; 

	&quot;I dunno Dachi,&quot; said Ranma. &quot;I don&#39;t think we should 
make her angry again. It doesn&#39;t make for good business to fight 
with your partners.&quot; 

	Tilting her head to one side Kodachi lazily traced her 
fingertips up Ranma&#39;s chest as she purred, &quot;I agree but I also 
think that it makes for good business to have happy partners. 
And besides, it would be fun to watch her primal instincts set 
free. Don&#39;t you agree?&quot; 

	Ranma gave a soft chuckle. &quot;I definitely agree with that. 
But how&#39;re we gonna get that to happen?&quot; 

	&quot;Just this,&quot; murmured Kodachi as she retrieved a small 
brown pouch from out of nowhere. 

	Eyeing the pouch Ranma broke into a wide grin as he 
said, &quot;Oh yeah. That&#39;s gonna set her free for sure.&quot; 

	&quot;And take away that horrible repressed nature,&quot; added 
Kodachi with a sly smile. 

	Matching Kodachi&#39;s smile Ranma looked at the brown 
pouch with her as they wondered what effect the highly 
susceptible love dust would have on their dear partner. 

--- 

	The couple was unaware of the small winged pixie that 
was flying behind them as they headed back to the Tendo dojo. 
They figured that by this time Nabiki should&#39;ve calmed down 
and they wanted to expose the love dust to her. That meant 
having to find her first. Perfume on the other hand, still was 
upset about being splashed but consoled herself with the 
reminder that she had managed to stay with her targets. 

	Now all she had to do was regain her human form and 
her mission would be on its way to completion. Because this 
time she wasn&#39;t going to let anything or anyone get in her way of 
accomplishing her most sacred of duties. 

	Relishing in her soon to be revenge Perfume released 
what was supposed to be manic tones of laughter but instead 
sounded like charming melodic bells. Forming a grimace she 
sped up her flight all while spewing vulgarities in reference to 
the displeasure she felt for her damned kawaii form. 

	She was still flying discretely behind her targets as she 
took in their dwelling with narrowed eyes. It didn&#39;t surprise her 
at all that the thieves would live in such opulence. Making a 
closer study of her surroundings Perfume&#39;s sapphire eyes 
widened and she mentally cursed her carelessness. 

	Without her own volition she flew forward to near one of 
her greatest enemies in her cursed form. The light was just as 
bright as she had remembered it. In a perverse way it reminded 
her of the light of God. Closer and closer she flew to her goal 
until suddenly she was upon it and she felt herself grow warm 
from its light. 

	Her mind shouted at her to stop her approach but her 
body would not listen. Closer yet she flew until suddenly she 
was upon the light and once again the horrifying pain entered 
her system. The electricity flowed through her tiny frame and 
damning this stupidly kawaii form Perfume floated weakly to 
the ground with her wings crushed and body badly burnt. 

	Perfume blearily focused her eyes upon her enemy from 
on high and before she lost consciousness she let loose a silent 
curse upon whomever had invented the bug zapper. 

--- 

	&quot;Oh my,&quot; said Kasumi softly. 

	She had just finished sweeping the front walk and was 
about to dump the contents of the dust pan into the garbage 
when something caught her eye. Leaning in closer Kasumi 
carefully inspected the form of a very tiny and very dirty little 
woman with wings. Delicately lifting the winged woman out of 
the dust pan which was now resting on the kitchen counter 
Kasumi searched her memories. Her mother used read her 
stories with creatures like this in them but what had they been 
called? So much time had passed... 

	&quot;Pixies,&quot; she recalled in wonderment. &quot;But I didn&#39;t think 
that they really existed.&quot; 

	Quietly she moved towards the sink to lightly turn on the 
tap water so only a few drops escaped. Wetting the edge of her 
apron Kasumi gently wiped at the pixie&#39;s lovely face. Miniature 
eyelashes fluttered and the golden haired pixie released a soft 
moan that sounded like melodic bells. 

	&quot;Poor pixie,&quot; said Kasumi sympathetically. &quot;You&#39;re so 
dirty. What could have possibly have happened to you? And 
how did you end up in my dust pan?&quot; 

	Suddenly the pixie&#39;s eyes opened and gazing up at 
Kasumi in certain fright she backed away to barely rest upon the 
tips of her fingers. Golden eyebrows furrowed and she paused to 
shake her tiny fist at Kasumi. 

	&quot;Tink tink tink!&quot; the pixie declared imperiously before 
she slammed her miniature fist onto Kasumi&#39;s finger tip. 

	Kasumi stared at the pixie for a moment before she 
frowned and said, &quot;Who are you calling a beast? And what 
makes you think that I kidnapped you?&quot; 

	&quot;Tink! Tink tink--&quot; the pixie stopped abruptly in her 
speech to look at Kasumi with wide eyes. &quot;Tink?&quot; she asked in 
clear amazement. 

	&quot;Of course I can understand you,&quot; said Kasumi. &quot;But I&#39;m 
not sure that&#39;s a good thing considering how vulgar your 
language seems to be. You know that&#39;s hardly the way a nice 
pixie like you should be speaking.&quot; 

	&quot;Tink tink tink,&quot; said the pixie sarcastically. Shakily she 
rose to her feet and continued, &quot;Tink? Tink tink.&quot; 

	&quot;Hot water?&quot; murmured Kasumi looking thoughtful. She 
considered the pixie a moment before she smiled and said, &quot;All 
right but only since you asked so nicely.&quot; 

	&quot;Tink tink...&quot; the pixie muttered under her breath while 
she gingerly stepped off of Kasumi&#39;s hand to stand on the 
kitchen counter. 

	&quot;I heard that,&quot; reprimanded Kasumi cheerfully. &quot;You 
really ought to stop using so much profanity.&quot; 

	The pixie flushed and said sheepishly, &quot;Tink...&quot; 

	&quot;You&#39;re forgiven,&quot; said Kasumi easily as she turned on 
the hot water so it let loose only a few drops. She watched as the 
pixie slid down into the sink and questioned, &quot;May I ask how a 
pixie like you came to Japan? I didn&#39;t know that any of your 
kind actually existed.&quot; 

	Looking up the pixie sighed and replied, &quot;Tink. Tink 
tink.&quot; 

	&quot;Jusenkyo?&quot; said Kasumi while the pixie walked near the 
dripping hot water. &quot;That makes sense I suppose. After all, 
Ranma does change into a girl elf.&quot; 

	&quot;Girl elf?&quot; a harsh voice growled. 

	Shifting her eyes forward Kasumi was met with the sight 
of a very naked girl sitting in her sink. The girl had long flowing 
chestnut hair that seemed to sparkle in the sun as it ran in curly 
waves down her back. Her body was toned to perfection and 
looked quite like those models of the human form that Kasumi 
had looked at in her medical texts. There was also something in 
the way her muscled tensed that made it clear she was a person 
to be reckoned with. But what really caught Kasumi&#39;s attention 
were those hypnotic sapphire eyes that she had seen only 
seconds ago in the body of an adorably kawaii pixie. Backing 
away unsteadily Kasumi said, &quot;Oh my. Is that you Pixie-san?&quot; 

	&quot;Name is Perfume,&quot; the girl responded sharply. &quot;Am 
looking for girl elf. Where she?&quot; 

	Before Kasumi could formulate a reply the sound of a 
loud splash and disturbing peals of laughter met their ears. 

	&quot;The laugh of demon thief,&quot; hissed Perfume. Shoving 
herself up and out of the sink the naked Amazon ran out of the 
kitchen while retrieving her double bladed axes. 

	Observing this with wide brown eyes Kasumi said the 
only thing she possibly could in situation like this. 

	&quot;Oh my.&quot; 

--- 

	A now elfin Ranma was staring up at Nabiki who stood 
on the dojo roof glaring at her and Kodachi. Spitting out the 
water in her mouth Ranma pushed some loose strands of blonde 
hair out of her eyes. 

	&quot;Why&#39;d you do that?&quot; asked Ranma sourly. 

	Tossing her head to one side Nabiki gave her usual 
arrogant smirk as she said, &quot;That&#39;s what you get for trying to 
meddle in my life. I can get my own boyfriend.&quot; 

	&quot;Indeed?&quot; Kodachi murmured as she inspected her 
business partner with careful violet eyes. &quot;Then haven&#39;t why you 
gotten one yet? You enjoy being alone?&quot; 

	Nabiki was about to reply when an enraged voice 
shouted out, &quot;Demon thieves! I finally find you!&quot; 

	Three pairs of eyes looked in the direction the voice 
came from to study the sleek and muscular body of a naked girl 
holding a pair of axes. After a moment, Kodachi smiled in sultry 
observation. 

	&quot;Well now,&quot; said Kodachi. &quot;I&#39;m not sure what I should 
be considering. Your beauteous assets so clearly shown or the 
fact that you called my dearest a demon.&quot; 

	&quot;Demon thieves,&quot; corrected Ranma with a smirk. &quot;She 
said thieves as in plural. That means you too Dachi. Maybe even 
our sweet and docile Nabchan.&quot; 

	While Nabiki scowled at this comment, Kodachi quirked 
a raven eyebrow. Turning back to the naked girl she said, &quot;I can 
understand the thievery accusation but why on earth would you 
think me or Nabiki dearest a demon? Ranma darling I can 
understand. His elfin form is often misconstrued as such but I 
look quite normal.&quot; 

	&quot;You are demon thieves,&quot; the girl pronounced as she 
pointed one of her double bladed axes at the couple. &quot;Who steal 
treasures from my tribe. Name is Perfume the Enforcer of 
Joketsuzoku and I is here to kill you.&quot; 

	A long moment passed as the couple considered this 
grim declaration then in a lightning quick motion Kodachi 
produced a smoke bomb which she threw to the ground. While 
clouds of smoke filled the yard Ranma grabbed her girlfriend&#39;s 
hand as they made their escape. 

	Meanwhile Perfume was swiping the dark clouds from 
her view and upon seeing the yard empty she let loose a loud 
scream of frustration before tracking their departing trail. 

--- 

	Nabiki was standing on the roof to the dojo watching the 
scene take place and was surprised when a large cloud of smoke 
emerged from where her business partners had been. She 
observed curiously as Ranma leapt away with Kodachi only to 
be followed seconds later by the irate naked girl that carried a 
pair of axes. After nearly a week of dealing with the antics of 
the couple Nabiki should&#39;ve been expecting them to be headed 
her way. 

	She should&#39;ve expected it but she didn&#39;t. 

	And when they bounded past with the naked girl hot on 
their heels Nabiki barely had the time to dodge their quick 
moving forms. Unfortunately for her they kicked up quite the 
strong wind in their chase and this caused the normally agile 
Nabiki to lose her balance and fall off the roof. At the last 
second she managed to grab onto the edge of the roof which left 
her hanging rather haplessly outside of Akane&#39;s bedroom 
window. 

	Akane noticed Nabiki hanging outside of her window 
and then opened it only to peer around her form to watch the 
naked girl pursue Ranma and Kodachi into the dojo. 

	&quot;I knew it!&quot; she said triumphantly. Looking to Nabiki 
she continued, &quot;Did you see that girl Oneechan? Her name&#39;s 
Perfume and she was the one looking for you earlier.&quot; 

	&quot;Akane,&quot; said Nabiki through gritted teeth. &quot;I don&#39;t have 
time for chit chat. A little help here?&quot; 

	&quot;Help?&quot; Akane blinked. Studying Nabiki more closely 
she looked puzzled. &quot;Uhm... Oneechan? What are you doing 
hanging outside of my window?&quot; 

--- 

	Humming a melodic tune Kasumi went about preparing 
dinner. It was getting late which meant that her father and 
Ojisama Saotome would be home soon from their nightly drink 
at the bar. 

	Pulling out the skillet she wondered about hearing 
Nabiki shouting at the top of her lungs. &quot;She&#39;s gotten so much 
more vocal since Ranma and Kodachi have moved in with us,&quot; 
said Kasumi smiling. &quot;I think it&#39;s been good for her.&quot; 

	Kasumi had just retrieved the bottle of vinegar that 
Akane often confused with white wine when Ranma came 
running through the kitchen with Kodachi right behind her. The 
pair went by in such a rush that Kasumi felt her heart stop from 
the surprise of it all and in the rush of wind that accompanied 
their speedy exit the bottle of vinegar slipped through her 
fingers. 

	The crash of the bottle hitting the floor had only just 
accessed in her mind when the still naked Perfume rushed onto 
the premises and promptly stepped into the puddle of vinegar. 
Her eyes wide Kasumi observed as the Amazon Enforcer lost 
her balance and skidded around the kitchen before she hastily 
grabbed onto the rack with the pots hanging on them. Kasumi 
tried to tell her not to but it was too late and one after one the 
pots fell with a loud crash upon Perfume until she was buried 
beneath them all. Seconds later her pair of double bladed axes 
landed to imbed themselves into the large cauldron that sat on 
the top of the pile. 

	When the chaos had finally cleared and the kitchen was 
silent once again Kasumi observed the twitching fingers of 
Perfume, the only part of her that was visible, in certain dismay. 
Like before she could think of only one thing to say about her 
current situation. 

	&quot;Oh my.&quot; 

--- 

	&quot;I simply cannot believe those Amazons sent that ruffian 
to finish us off,&quot; said Kodachi with a sniff. &quot;Surely they didn&#39;t 
believe someone of such sloppy methodology could possibly 
end our existence. What sort of assassin announces that they&#39;re 
here to kill you? It gives the target perfect warning for escape.&quot; 

	Kodachi was walking alongside Ranma who was floating 
slightly off the ground next to her girlfriend. After they had 
escaped from the dojo and the wrath of Perfume the couple 
began to wander aimlessly. Presently they walking the streets of 
downtown Nerima unaware of the stares that they were 
attracting. 

	&quot;Anger makes a lot of people stupid,&quot; said Ranma in 
thoughtful declaration. She tilted her golden head back and 
looked at the night sky. &quot;I think it&#39;d be best if we stayed away 
from the dojo until we can figure out what to do about her. She&#39;s 
obviously been tracking us.&quot; 

	&quot;You&#39;re right of course,&quot; murmured Kodachi. She 
frowned as she said, &quot;This is most inconvienent. Now we&#39;ll have 
to put off our fun with Nabiki dearest.&quot; 

	Chuckling at this Ranma hooked her arm in Kodachi&#39;s 
while she said, &quot;We can test the effect the love dust has on 
Nabchan anytime, Dachi. We gotta figure out what&#39;s up with axe 
girl.&quot; 

	&quot;I just wonder why she was so upset,&quot; Kodachi mused. 
&quot;Wasn&#39;t our business with the Amazons quite scarce?&quot; 

	&quot;Yup,&quot; Ranma affirmed. &quot;We visited two Amazon 
villages when we were in China. The first one was pretty 
smooth and the second one...&quot; she trailed off sourly. 

	&quot;Your idiotic father sabotaged with his greedy love for 
food,&quot; finished Kodachi. &quot;No doubt the axe wielding beauty was 
from the second village.&quot; Violet eyes lifted to meet cobalt ones. 
&quot;What was its name, dearest?&quot; 

	&quot;Joke something or other,&quot; said Ranma carelessly. She 
squinted her eyes and concentrated. &quot;Joke on you? I dunno 
Dachi. All our scams sorta melt together after awhile and it&#39;s 
hard to remember what places we&#39;ve hit.&quot; 

	Tipping her head in slight acknowledgment of this 
Kodachi halted in her walk in front of a very posh looking hotel. 
A slow sensuous smile spread across her features as she studied 
the high class clientele coming and leaving the hotel. It was a 
virtual cornucopia of the rich and richer. She gazed upon it and 
could already imagine the limitless amount of scores they could 
make in such a place. For them any opulent environment served 
as their own personal Eden that was just full of apples ripe for 
the picking. 

	All they had to do was figure out a way to get in. 

	&quot;Ranma darling,&quot; said Kodachi in sultry tones. &quot;Get 
ready to use your womanly charms. I believe that I&#39;ve found 
sufficient dwellings for the night.&quot; 

--- 

	When Perfume regained consciousness she heard the 
muffled sound of three feminine voices. It didn&#39;t take long for 
her to figure out that she was the topic of conversation and 
stilling herself she kept focused on regaining her strength as she 
listened to any useful information they might give away 
regarding the demon thieves. 

	&quot;I don&#39;t trust her Oneechan,&quot; said the first voice. &quot;She 
was running around with axes for the Kami&#39;s sake!&quot; 

	&quot;So?&quot; the second voice started. &quot;Some people walk 
around with bokkens. What&#39;s the difference? She&#39;s a nice girl 
Nabiki. You just have to get to know her.&quot; 

	A rude snort sounded at this and the third voice said 
quietly, &quot;Her injuries are all my fault. I was the one who did this 
to her and it&#39;s my responsibility to take care of her.&quot; 

	&quot;But Kasumi--&quot; began the first voice that apparently 
belonged to the one called Nabiki. 

	&quot;No,&quot; said the third voice in steely tones that didn&#39;t fit 
the kind girl named Kasumi that Perfume had met. &quot;This was all 
my fault Imotochan. I have to help her.&quot; 

	There was a long moment of silence then the sound of 
someone abruptly leaving and the second voice that Perfume 
now knew belonged to Akane said, &quot;She took that really well. I 
swear she&#39;s getting more angry each day.&quot; 

	&quot;Akane,&quot; said Kasumi in a soft reprimand. &quot;She&#39;s just a 
bit high-strung. That&#39;s all.&quot; 

	&quot;That&#39;s one way of putting it,&quot; Akane said dryly. &quot;I have 
to get going Oneechan. The team is supposed to attend some 
sort of charity auction and they need me there. I think they&#39;re 
selling a date with me or something.&quot; 

	Perfume heard the sound of Akane&#39;s lively footsteps exit 
the room and there was another pause then she froze as she felt 
gentle fingers brush some loose strands of hair from her 
forehead. As they did so she couldn&#39;t help but open her sapphire 
eyes to look up into Kasumi&#39;s gaze. 

	&quot;Oh my,&quot; Kasumi whispered. &quot;You&#39;re awake.&quot; 

	&quot;Yes,&quot; said Perfume shortly while in a fluid movement 
she pushed herself up into a sitting position. When she did so the 
sheet she wore fell to reveal her still naked form. &quot;You is the 
one called Kasumi? You cause my injuries?&quot; 

	Ducking her gaze Kasumi replied quietly, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. It 
was me who dropped the vinegar that you slipped in.&quot; 

	&quot;Kasumi defeat me,&quot; Perfume murmured. 

	 While Kasumi continued to avert her eyes from 
Perfume&#39;s naked form the Enforcer contemplated the effects that 
this apparent defeat would have on her mission. Perfume never 
expected to gain an Airen in this way. Much less gain an Airen 
that possessed such a clearly gentle nature. 

	&quot;Pixie-san?&quot; questioned Kasumi softly, her eyes still 
focused on the floor. &quot;Are you all right? You&#39;re so quiet...&quot; 

	Lifting her gaze Perfume favored Kasumi with a dry 
expression as she said, &quot;Name is Perfume, not Pixie-san.&quot; 

	&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Kasumi flushed a light rosy hue that the 
Amazon Enforcer found very attractive on her. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to 
insult you--&quot; 

	&quot;Is okay,&quot; interrupted Perfume as she delicately pressed 
her fingers against Kasumi&#39;s soft lips. When she slowly pulled 
them away she swore she could hear the other girl release a soft 
sigh. Moving forward in a fluid motion Perfume stopped when 
they were only millimeters apart. She then tipped up Kasumi&#39;s 
chin and said, &quot;I am Amazon and you is outsider. And we has 
rules about outsiders what defeat Amazons in battle.&quot; 

	&quot;Rules?&quot; questioned Kasumi as she nervously licked her 
lips. She wasn&#39;t used to someone invading her personal space 
like this. Especially someone as attractive as Perfume. It was 
strangely exhilarating. &quot;What type of rules?&quot; 

	&quot;All outsiders what defeat Amazon woman has either 
one of two things happen to them,&quot; Perfume informed while she 
maintained her near contact with Kasumi. She was finding being 
this close to the other girl unexpectedly erotic. &quot;They receive 
kiss of death or kiss of life. Receive kiss of death the outsider is 
hunt down and killed but if receive kiss of life...&quot; 

	With Kasumi was hanging on her every word Perfume 
quickly darted forward to meet their lips in a passionate kiss that 
took Kasumi completely by surprise. It was her first true kiss 
and with it Kasumi felt a wave of desire the likes of which she 
had never imagined. After a moment she melted into Perfume&#39;s 
strong but gentle hold as she began to return the kiss with 
interest. And by the time they finally parted Kasumi gave the 
tiniest of moans. 

	But then, all too quickly reality set in. 

	&quot;Oh my,&quot; whispered Kasumi. She was touching her lips 
lightly as she quickly backed away from Perfume as if she had 
been burned. Swallowing the large lump in her throat she hastily 
got up off the floor and began pacing. &quot;Oh my. Oh my...&quot; 
Kasumi repeated the words as if they were a mantra. Finally she 
paused in her erratic walk to look at Perfume as she asked, 
&quot;Why did you do that?&quot; 

	&quot;Is kiss of life,&quot; said Perfume in confusion as she 
languidly rose to her feet. Taking a hesitant step forward she 
continued, &quot;You is my Airen now. You defeat me in battle.&quot; 

	&quot;Oh my,&quot; said Kasumi again. She held her hands up in a 
defenseless gesture. &quot;Wait,&quot; she began slowly. &quot;What does 
Airen mean exactly? Please say that it means we&#39;re friends.&quot; 

	At this comment Perfume had to chuckle. &quot;That not what 
it mean Airen but we could be friends.&quot; She formed a sly 
expression then added, &quot;Among other things.&quot; In response to 
this Kasumi blinked. The Enforcer soon relented and said, 
&quot;Airen mean special person. You defeated me. Now we is 
engaged under Amazon law.&quot; 

	&quot;Engaged?&quot; repeated Kasumi numbly. 

	&quot;Is so,&quot; said Perfume with a nod. Despite her naked 
status she somehow produced a small booklet from out of 
nowhere and handed it Kasumi. &quot;Read for yourself.&quot; 

	Taking the booklet Kasumi read aloud, &quot;The official 
Amazon law book.&quot; Quickly flipping through the pages she 
finally came onto the section that detailed what happened when 
an outsider defeated an Amazon warrior. When she finished 
reading she looked up at Perfume and said rather haplessly, 
&quot;And you gave me the kiss of life?&quot; 

	&quot;Yes,&quot; Perfume purred as she crossed the room to stand 
in front of Kasumi. While she wound her hands around the back 
of the other girl&#39;s neck Kasumi nervously moved backwards 
until she hit the wall with a thump. 

	&quot;Oh my,&quot; Kasumi said weakly. She directed her brown 
eyes up at the ceiling and murmured faintly, &quot;I guess that I 
should be thankful I didn&#39;t receive the kiss of death.&quot; 

	&quot;You should,&quot; replied Perfume smugly. Her breath was 
hot as she lowered her lips towards Kasumi&#39;s. &quot;Airen.&quot; 

	Kasumi quickly ducked her head away from Perfume 
and managed to slip out of her grasp. &quot;About that,&quot; she said 
nervously. &quot;Don&#39;t you think that we should get to know each 
other before we do anything? It just isn&#39;t proper to just hop 
into... well. You know what I mean.&quot; After she said this Perfume 
stared blankly at her and Kasumi sighed. &quot;I take it that 
expression means that you don&#39;t know.&quot; She looked up to 
solemnly meet their eyes. &quot;I can&#39;t sleep with you.&quot; 

	Sapphire eyes went wide and Perfume said in the barest 
of whispers, &quot;Airen not want me?&quot; 

	Startled at the bleak and helpless tone of Perfume&#39;s voice 
Kasumi felt her heart constrict. She hadn&#39;t wanted to hurt the 
Enforcer&#39;s feelings. That was the last thing she had wanted to do. 
Perfume was the first person to pay her any attention in a very 
long time. All she wanted was for the situation to slow down. 
She wasn&#39;t ready for a physical relationship with someone she 
just met. And there was the fact that Perfume was female. 
Kasumi had never considered being with other women before 
and it would take some time to adjust to the idea. Some time but 
not much, she thought with a wry smile as she remembered the 
affect Perfume&#39;s passionate kiss had on her. 

	&quot;No,&quot; said Kasumi in soft reassurance as she crossed the 
room to touch Perfume&#39;s shoulders lightly. &quot;It isn&#39;t that at all 
Perfume. I&#39;m just... not ready to do that sort of thing yet. I think 
we should get to know each other better first.&quot; She then ducked 
her head to meet sapphire eyes. &quot;Is that all right?&quot; 

	Perfume felt herself drown in the kindness of soft brown 
eyes and replied, &quot;Yes. That all right.&quot; 

	&quot;Good,&quot; Kasumi said with a sigh. She smiled happily 
and then diverted her attention to the nearby closet where she 
pulled out a terrycloth robe and handed it to Perfume. When the 
Enforcer put it on Kasumi led her back to the futon where they 
both sat down. &quot;So,&quot; she smiled again. &quot;Lets talk. Tell me why it 
is that you&#39;re here.&quot; 

	Returning Kasumi&#39;s smile Perfume immediately 
launched into the long and arduous tale of the infamous demon 
thieves.
