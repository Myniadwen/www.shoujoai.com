<h2>A Fall of Cherry  Blossoms</h2>
<p>Time is a tapestry.<p>
  If one could step back and somehow view the universe  from outside, one could see that all of time exists simultaneously.  The past, the future, the now, they all exist  at the same time in the grand weave, but for those of us who are the warp and  the woof of the tapestry, we can never see how our threads intertwine.  Only in the world-computer, Yggdrasil, can  this entire tapestry be viewed, and even then, only in part.<p>
  At present, the woman sitting at the screen was  herself worthy of a second look.  The  leather harness she wore almost gave her the appearance of wings, the wide  straps that curved around her shoulders supporting two trailing pieces that  curved on the floor under her.  The black  halter top and bikini bottom under the leather emphasized the curves and  sexuality of her feminine form, displaying her figure to excellent  advantage.  Her hair was raven black,  with almost auburn highlights, the short cropped pixie cut of the front blending  into a long thick ponytail that vanished into the seat behind her.   The blue diamond shaped tattoos on her  forehead and cheeks glinted softly as the light from the monitor played over  her beautiful face.<p>
  Peorth studied the screen and cursed softly.  Another damn bug!  They seemed to be increasing in frequency  since Urd had bludgeoned the system with that drunken wish.  If only Kami-Sama hadn’t approved it  personally!<p>
  And since Skuld had gone to Earth too, <em>she</em> was stuck de-bugging.  She sighed as she got up from the screen, her  long black hair clinging to the seat back for a second before she went to the  closet and dug out one of Skuld’s hammers.   She hefted it a few times, a small grin on her face as she mentally  plastered Urd’s face on a bug.  Stress  relief time!<p>
  As she vanished into the world-computer’s depths, a  monitor at her workstation flipped itself on and lines of code scrolled  across.  Within the main screen’s image,  a thread shifted imperceptibly.<p>
  A warning came up on the main screen and flashed,  indicating a probability shift in the thread, a small change akin to the flap  of a butterfly’s wing.<p>
  The warning acknowledged itself and vanished, leaving  behind the image of the tapestry and the faint echoes of an annoyed goddess  who’s bug hunting had been interrupted when her quarry ceased to exist.   The side monitor blinked and turned itself  off as Peorth stormed back to her workstation to try and figure out where the  bug had gone, only to blink as the system reported none.<p>
  Annoyed, Peorth queried Ex, the operator currently on  monitor duty.  “What happened?”<p>
  The operator looked up from her console.  “Mistress?”<p>
  “The bug, Cherie.   What happened to the bug?”<p>
  The young grey haired female tapped a few keys and ran  a system trace.<p>
  “It’s gone, Mistress.   It appears the bug activated a subroutine and was erased by it.”<p>
  “Which one?”<p>
  The girl typed for several more minutes.  “I am uncertain, Mistress.  There are no records of the subroutine’s  actions in the log.” <p>
  Curious.  She  had Ex transfer the data to her terminal and tried to trace the routine, but  ran up against a code wall.  It had been  activated from a secured section of Yggdrasil she had never realized existed.<p>
  She tried every code she could think of to no  avail.  Yggdrasil itself denied the  section even existed though with much trial and error, Peorth discovered much  of Yggdrasil’s automatic functions seemed to route through it.  In fact, it seemed as if the entire reality  maintenance subroutine was being monitored by the sealed sector transparently.  If she hadn’t investigated the subroutine, it  would have been impossible to notice the anomaly.<p>
  Aggravated, she settled in to do some digging.  It took several hours of eliminating dead  ends and blind alleys before she finally located an access portal.  Whoever had established the hidden program was  good.  It was at least as sophisticated  as the string program, though it’s scope seemed limited solely to the Earth.  So far, all she’d been able to determine  other than it’s size was that it several hundred years old.<p>
  As she locked onto the portal she felt a grim  anticipation.  A few keystrokes tied her  to the gateway, and she sent a log-on command.<p>
  She blinked at the REQUEST DENIED.  She typed in her override code again.<p>
  //REQUEST DENIED: Override code invalid.  Goddess Peorth, you do not have clearance to  access.//<p>
  “What?  Mon  dieu!  How did it know who I was?” she  muttered to herself, then blinked as letters began typing themselves across the  screen.<p>
  //I have access to the Yggdrasil database, Goddess  Peorth.  I verified your clearance.  You do not possess sufficient clearance to  access me.//<p>
  “We’ll see about that, Cherie.”  She typed in a secondary override and keyed  up a code breaker.<p>
  //Please desist, Goddess Peorth.  You do not possess the required clearance.  Further attempts to access will force me to  notify my creators of your efforts.//<p>
  That caused her to give the screen a raised  eyebrow.  “I’m the Sysop.  Any warnings you send would automatically be  routed to me anyway, non?”<p>
  //Negative, Goddess Peorth.  I am a secured autonomous system established  to perform a set task.  If I am  interrupted or detect interference in my task, I may take such action as I deem  needed.  I do not at present deem you  hostile to my mission, simply curious.  I  have means to alert my creator to your attempts to hack me, but doing so may  result in disciplinary action to you.  As  you are attempting to isolate what may be a problem within your jurisdiction, I  do not feel you deserve this.  I am not a  problem, Goddess Peorth.  I am part of  the system.//<p>
  “And I’m just supposed to accept your word, mon  cherie?  For all I know, you may be a  virus or a hack program yourself.”<p>
  //Negative.  I  am Yggdrasil subroutine 453784321234453423452345523239787988: Project  Phoenixmoon.//<p>
  Peorth blinked.   She keyed in the subroutine number on her side display and called it  up.  It was no surprise when it came up  classified.  She queried a list of  authorized users.<p>
  She drew in a breath in shock and turned to look at  the main screen.<p>
  //Please desist in your efforts, Goddess Peorth.//<p>
  She nodded and the login screen closed itself.  She sat back and mused at the strangeness of  an intelligent program that the Sysop wasn’t supposed to know existed.<p>
  Still, far be it from her to question Kami-Sama.  One just did not ask the All-Father why he  had a covert program on the world-computer.<p>
  But why was Legend listed as the other authorized  user?  What reason would Kami-Sama have  to allow the Dragon access to Project Phoenixmoon, whatever that was?  </p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Silent footsteps moving through intricate patterns.  Long ribbons curving through the air in swift motions.  One form following another in endless array.  Wall of shadows, dance of flame, veil of ice.<p>
  Zhu Shu had been doing her forms for hours, lost in  the dance as her mind whirled it’s own dizzying patterns.  The physical exercises, ingrained so deeply  they were reflexive, had helped her to tune out the outside world and focus  inwards, trying to once more find her center amidst the raging emotions in her  mind.<p>
  The peace of the shrine had been exactly what she  needed to calm her raging heart and find her ground again, leaving her calm and  detached, an observer able to consciously sort the storm tossed emotions that  flowed through her, though staying centered had so far proven to be far more  difficult than it had ever been in her life.   The winds of her emotions had become as unpredictable as a cyclone.<p>
  She’d at last conquered the jealousy she’d felt at  Shan Pu’s betrothal, filtering her true feelings from the remnants of Akane’s  in her mind. Her refusal to Ranma’s offer of marriage had been sound, however  personally painful it may have been. He was better off with Shan Pu and Akane,  women who felt the passion of his touch.<p>
  He deserved better than a woman who could only feel  passion with another woman.<p>
  She loved him. For all her searching and separating  her own feelings from those Akane had left in her head, she could not deny  that. Akane’s feelings had merely complimented what she had already felt. She  loved him as deeply as she had ever loved anyone, but there was no passion for  him in her. His touch sparked nothing sexual. She would have gladly given him  her body, had he desired it, but it would have been empty… as meaningless an  act as any she had been taught to perform as an Emperor’s concubine.<p>
  And he would have felt that, and been hurt far worse  than her refusal had done.<p>
  Yet everything she could not feel for Ranma, she did  for Akane. She could scarcely contain herself in Akane’s presence for desire of  her.  She had been so close to falling,  to betraying everything she believed, her honor, her duty. For her love, Zhu  Shu would have given up on everything she had lived for… <p>
  …Had it not meant betraying Ranma.<p>
  And even that had almost occurred. Had Akane not  relented that day in the dojo, she would have fallen.<p>
  Too close. Her heart had come too close to betraying  them all. <p>
  No, far better to seal her emotions back behind a wall  of will, back to the way she had endured… <p>
  And yet, even now, she would not change what had been,  or the wondrous things that had occurred, especially the miracle she had  explored in her meditations…<p>
  Somewhere, on some level, she and Akane had never  unmerged. There, in the back of her mind, was a connection, a bond. She could  feel Akane through it, could feel her moods, and even a sense of some of her  thoughts, but over everything else, she could feel her love.<p>
  Sisters… in so much more than blood.<p>
  Zhu Shu had worried her by leaving so abruptly, but  she had come to understand why she had, and her concern had not lessened in the  slightest. Like a mental caress, her subconscious whispered reassurances to Zhu  Shu.<p>
  She had been grateful for those reassurances the first  few hours of her dance, and her attempts to order her thoughts, for they had  kept her from drowning in despair, and had helped to distinguish Akane’s  emotions from her own.  It had enabled  her to finally regain some of the calm which had eluded her of late.<p>
  Finally centered once more, and for the moment in  control of her raging heart, Zhu Shu opened her chi paths again, feeling the  warmth of the golden flow.  She would  forever share Akane’s energy, as Akane shared hers, but like the link, she  considered that a blessing. She might have lost her center for awhile from the  shock, but she had gained so much more.<p>
  She had… a sister. Someone she could talk to, and  share her heart with, and never fear she would drive her away. She would never  be alone… not like she had been.  She had  been blood-sister to Shan Pu, but the bond to Akane was far deeper.  It was more like the bond she had once had  with Ying-Ying, though in some ways, it was far less intense.  Her bond with Ying-Ying had been created  voluntarily, and during several hours of lovemaking, so it had always carried  an undercurrent of the passion and utter devotion she had shared with  Ying-Ying, but they had never exchanged memories like she had with Akane.<p>
  She smiled as she recalled again how amazed they both  had been when she and Ying-Ying had blended on that one wonderful day they had  surrendered to each others gentle explorations, each striving to give  themselves to the other as completely as they could.   It had been so sudden, a rush that had  chilled her and warmed her like she had never been before or since.  It had been like she had suddenly stepped out  of her body and partially into Ying-Ying’s.   She had been able to feel her own hand on Ying-Ying’s skin from both her  body and Ying-Ying’s.<p>
  That sensation faded the further away they were from  each other, but never fully.  Ying-Ying  had felt every blow her aunt had delivered to her upon the discovery of what  Zhu Shu had done, and she had gone to tell Shi what his daughter was  doing.   Even when Ying-Ying’s parents  had moved to another village, that link had remained.  She had felt Ying-Ying’s despair, her hope  crumbling, her growing despondency, and finally, her death.  She had felt nothing then… until she had  awoken in her bed looking up at the strange woman’s face and her grandfather.  There had been a significant look that had  passed between the woman and Shi before she had left, never to return.<p>
  It was strange.   For the first time since she had begun to build her wall against the  grief she had been overwhelmed with following Ying-Ying’s death, she had been  able to think of their days together without the pounding surge of loss that  had howled outside the wall for so long.   She still felt the loss keenly, but the wild undercurrent that had  sought to drag her to her doom for so long had lessened.<p>
  For the first time in four years, she could think of  Ying-Ying without wanting to die.<p>
  She felt the tears falling as her body finally could  continue no more, and she slowly collapsed into a heap on the floor of the  shrine and cried silently.  <p>
  She felt something soft brush her face and land in her  hand.  She opened her eyes to see a  single cherry blossom, a drop of dew falling down its side like a teardrop.<p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;A bloom cannot live away from  the tree that nurtures it.&gt;&gt;</em> a  quiet voice spoke in her mind.  She sat  up and turned, but saw nothing.  Only  fitful shadows of the temple fire.  She  turned forward again and stared at the flower as the single drop of dew was  joined by another.  It had sounded so  much like her voice. <p>
  “Of course it did, my love.  It <em>is</em> my voice.”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked up and froze, her gaze lost in a pair  of bottomless blue eyes surrounded by pink hair.  “Ying-Ying…”<p>
  “Yes.”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head.  “I must be…”<p>
  “Dreaming?  Most  definitely.  You haven’t slept in over  twenty-four hours and you wore yourself out physically.  You fell asleep and I took advantage of your  being in the shrine to enter your dreams.”<p>
  “Oh…” Zhu Shu said in wonder, then jumped up to hold  her. “Gods, Ying-Ying, I’ve missed you!”<p>
  The pink haired girl stroked her hair. “I know, love.”  She let Zhu Shu hold her for long moments.   “I’ve missed you too, Little Mouse.   And I’m worried for you.”<p>
  Zhu Shu lifted tear streaked eyes to Ying-Ying’s  face.  “Worried?”<p>
  “Yes.” Ying-Ying stepped away from Zhu Shu so she  could look at her, but kept her hands intertwined. “You have been so distressed  lately.  And I know that a part of you  fears you have betrayed me as much as you fear you almost betrayed others.”<p>
  Zhu Shu gave her a startled glance.  “I- I…”<p>
  “Oh, Love.  I  know that <em>consciously</em>, you don’t  think about it that way, but I could always read your heart.  I came to comfort you.”<p>
  Zhu Shu turned away. “Beloved?  I- I wish you could… but my heart feels so-  so-”<p>
  “Divided?” Ying-Ying smiled.  “I can tell.” Her fingers reached out to  touch Zhu Shu’s back, Zhu Shu’s clothes suddenly vanishing as Ying-Ying traced  out the pattern of petals on her back. “Without you, I faded as a flower torn  from a tree will.  The Tiger will always  be a part of you, yet ever apart as well.   And there are two you have yet to meet.”<p>
  Zhu Shu whirled, her eyes locked on Ying-Ying’s  smile.  Her look was one of utterly  stunned amazement.  Ying-Ying leaned  forward to peck her on the lips.<p>
  “You never realized?   That I am the Flower and Akane is the Tiger?”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head.<p>
  “The Dragon gave you signs, Love.  To show you your destiny.”<p>
  “Am I destined to lose my loves then?  Like you and Akane?”<p>
  “No. I was the Flower…   Like any flower, I was not destined to remain.  I grieve for the pain my loss caused you, yet  we were not destined for more than our brief span.  But the Flower turns into the seed, as I  planted the seeds of the woman you have become in you.  Akane is the Tiger and like the tiger, you  needed the strength her love will give you, as she needed the control you gave  her.  Together you will both be more than  either of you would have been apart.”<p>
  “Yet we will never be more than we are?”<p>
  “Do not mourn for that, Beloved.  There is happiness in store for you beyond  all measure.”<p>
  “How?  I am  destined to wed one whom I can never love and fulfill my family duties.”<p>
  “No. You are destined to fulfill your family duties  with one you will love.”<p>
  Zhu Shu turned away again.  “I wish that could be true.  Yet I know this is a dream.  How much of you is true, and how much is my  own fantasies?” <p>
  Ying-Ying stepped forward, turning Zhu Shu to face her  as she wrapped her arms around her and pressed her body against her. “All of it  and none, my love.  Yet I would give you  a parting gift before you go back to the waking world.”<p>
  “Yes?”<p>
  “I want you to have better memories of me than just  our parting…  Happier memories.”<p>
  Zhu Shu melted with her kiss, losing herself for what  seemed like an eternity as once again the feeling of existing entirely within  Ying-Ying’s love flooded through her and left her breathless.  As Ying-Ying drew back, she sighed  happily.  <p>
  “I will always have happy memories of you, my love.”<p>
  “I know.  But  for this instant, I don’t want them tinged with sadness.”<p>
  “I cannot promise that when I awake.”  Zhu Shu smiled.  “But when I am with you, I can never be sad.”<p>
  “But I am always here, love.  I am always and forever, here with you.”<p>
  “I don’t understand.”<p>
  “In time, perhaps you will.” Ying-Ying looked over her  shoulder towards the inner shrine door for a second.  “For now, know that my love for you has never  died.”  She reached out to caress Zhu  Shu’s face.  “And you can never betray  me.  Your happiness is paramount.  Your friends care for you, beloved.  They can help you if you let them.”<p>
  Zhu Shu pressed her face against Ying-Ying’s hand,  reveling in her touch.  “I know they want  to.  I just don’t know how they really  can.”<p>
  “Perhaps.   Perhaps you simply haven’t let yourself realize how they can.  You cannot live without love, Little  Mouse.  Perhaps Akane is out of reach,  but there are others closer to hand who care for you more than you realize.”<p>
  Zhu Shu blinked at Ying-Ying.  “Who?”<p>
  Ying-Ying smiled.   “Open your eyes, my love.  You  might be amazed at what you’ll see.”   <p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head, “I don’t want to wake yet,  beloved.  I don’t want to leave you.”<p>
  “But you must, Little Mouse.  It is not yet time for us to be rejoined.”<p>
  Zhu Shu stepped forward, her lips locking against  Ying-Ying’s as they kissed.  For another  timeless moment, they stood embraced, their bodies pressed tightly against each  other as they shared their love through their contact.  Finally, Zhu Shu broke the kiss, and stood  back, her eyes closed.<p>
  “I don’t want to see you go, beloved.  I want my last memory to be your face as we  kissed.”<p>
  Ying-Ying giggled.   “Silly.  You always <em>were</em> a hopeless romantic, Beloved.  It’s one of the things I love about you so  much.”<p>
  “I love you too.”<p>
  A hand reached out to caress Zhu Shu’s face one last  time.  “Always and forever, Beloved.  Always and forever, I am here.”<p>
  Then with a last whisper, as of a fall of cherry  blossoms, she was gone.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Zhu Shu gradually let her awareness return to the  world around her, and as she expected, found another concerned aura near her,  this one sweetly confused. She smiled softly at the memories of the dream, and  Ying-Ying’s words before opening her eyes to gaze into the violet eyes of Rei  Hino, her student and Sailor Mars.<p>
  “Zhu Shu? How long have you been here? Why didn’t you  wake me?” Rei’s voice was as concerned as her aura, her Shinto vocation as  discerning as Zhu Shu’s training.<p>
  Zhu Shu yawned and sat up.  “I apologize if I have offended, Rei-chan,  but there was no need to awaken you. I know my way around the shrine and what I  needed most was solitude, yet I welcome you now.” It would do no good to  attempt to hide that she had fled the Tendo’s… Rei would not be fooled.<p>
  “Oh, Zhu-chan, what happened? What’s the matter?  I’ve been so worried about you calling off  training this week.”<p>
  Zhu Shu moved to sit on a bench and sighed. “I have  accomplished my task Rei-chan. Shan Pu is betrothed to Ranma. That which I have  worked for is done, but it’s doing nearly unmade me.”<p>
  “Sensei?”  Rei’s  eyes were questioning.<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed.   “Shan Pu was betrothed to Ranma yesterday.  I-I just was not prepared for what my  feelings proved to be.  I needed to get  away.”<p>
  “Oh Sensei!” Rei came and sat beside her, putting her  arm around Zhu Shu and hugging her. “I’m glad you came here as a haven.”<p>
  “It has always been thus, from the first day that I  awoke within its peace.”<p>
  Rei finally did a double take. “Your accent?”<p>
  “I have changed in ways Rei. I bear within me pieces  of another’s heart, as she bears pieces of mine. It was unexpected, yet I count  it a blessing. We will never be separate again.” Zhu Shu smiled sadly.  “Perhaps, it is fate’s way of soothing the pain of the fact that we will never  be together either.”<p>
  Rei looked away, shadows in her eyes. “You mean Akane  don’t you?” A faint wistfulness was in her voice.<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Yes. I am in love with all of them  Rei-chan, if in different ways. Yet I cannot have any of them, for their sakes.  But my heart aches with the desire for that which is forever out of reach.”<p>
  “I know exactly how you feel.” Rei whispered softly,  forgetting how sharp Zhu Shu’s ears were; nor did she see the long look that  Zhu Shu gave her. Rei finally spoke louder. “You must love her a lot.”<p>
  “Rei-chan, I love her to the point I nearly destroyed  both of us.  I would have forsaken  everything for her sake, except loyalty. In the end, I could not betray a  friend.  I love her, Rei-chan, but I love  Ranma too, so I held her away, for his sake and the love that he and Akane  share, and that I hope they will come to share with my blood-sister.  I held her away, and Ranma, and Shan Pu…  Three times. Rei-chan, three loves, three offers of happiness I knew to be a  lie. For their sakes, I had no choice.”<p>
  “But why? If Akane and Ranma and Shan Pu all love  you?” Rei was looking at her, puzzled.<p>
  “Because, I would have destroyed their happiness,  Rei-chan. It is my curse to see too clearly.” She sighed. “I know an old lady  who calls me a ‘Little Mouse with the eyes of a Dragon’. I think I finally  understand what a curse that is.”<p>
  “The eyes of a Dragon see only truth.” Rei quoted.  “How is that a curse?”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked down, her eyes lost in shadow. “I  cannot veil my eyes to see only what I want to see. My heart cannot blind me to  the consequences of my giving in to my desires.”<p>
  Rei was quiet for a long moment. “As a Shinto  priestess, I guess I can see where that makes sense… but as Rei Hino, I know  what pain that must cause. It is not… <em>easy</em>…  to examine your own heart and desires with clear sight.” Her eyes fell on the  altar “But as a priestess, I’m supposed to see the truth too.” Her voice held a  tone of resignation.<p>
  It would be simpler, Zhu Shu knew, to let it pass, but  she was too bruised and battered from the storm of emotions she had already  endured and the dream.   She had caused  too much pain already.   Whirlwind  memories flitted through her head… Ying-Ying… Sarhia… Akane…<p>
  Duty told her what must be done, but that was the  future. This was now.  She had no more  will for fighting the storm, and Ying-Ying’s words echoed in her memory.<p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;You cannot live without  love…&gt;&gt;</em> <p>
  She reached out to cup Rei’s face and drew her eyes to  meet her own… Rei flinched when she realized what Zhu Shu sought there and  tried to look away again, but finally, reluctantly, she met Zhu Shu’s eyes  fully.<p>
  “What do <em>you</em> desire, Rei?” Zhu Shu whispered. </p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Rei stared, caught in the gaze of the Dragon. She had  asked herself that very question a thousand times, a hundred thousand. What <em>did</em> she want? And still her heart had no  answer. She had nearly caused Zhu Shu’s death when she had mistaken her for a  Cardian, yet had been forgiven so casually.   She had envied her, for Zhu Shu was so much of what she longed to be:  confident, graceful, poised, yet none of it was pretense.  Rei had sneered along with the rest of the  Senshi when Zhu Shu had claimed they had been lucky so far, yet she too had had  bones broken for her arrogance.  She had  hated her for how easily she seemed to get respect despite her seeming  contentment to play the role of a traditional female in every way but one, and  she had been so jealous of the way males seemed to lock on to Zhu Shu whenever  they had been together, almost completely ignoring <em>her…</em><p>
  Then she had spent time with Zhu Shu, and had come to  realize it was just Zhu Shu’s way.  She  had no expectations of anyone, and desired none of the male attention she got,  yet could not escape either.  She cared  for her friends unconditionally, regardless of who they were, and when she was  teaching, she asked for no less than their best, because she would give no less  herself…<p>
  …And when she had realized Zhu Shu’s preferences, she  had become more confused than ever.  Rei  had been her first friend among the Senshi, and she had always felt she was  closer to her than the other Senshi were. She had tended to her following her  near death at their hands; she had won her trust following that. She had cared  about Zhu Shu from the start, but the day she had spied on her, things had  changed.<p>
  Zhu Shu’s quick kiss, following so close on the  feelings Rei had felt when watching her practice had sparked a part of Rei she  had never acknowledged, a part she had really never recognized was there, but  that part had whispered to her what might have happened had Zhu Shu stayed at  the shrine.<p>
  And that small voice had prompted her to spy on Zhu  Shu’s kata the following day, and to the love of friendship was added the  element of desire.<p>
  In the weeks that followed she had wondered, and  explored her feelings, yet she had no answers, only confusion.  She liked men.  She had a crush on Mamoru and half a dozen  other guys… but she couldn’t deny her attraction to Zhu Shu either.<p>
  “<em>The eyes of a  dragon see only truth…</em>” Rei whispered, never realizing she was quoting in  Chinese. “<em>The flames of a dragon burn  away lies. The soul of a dragon knows only honor. The heart of the dragon feels  only love. The tears of a dragon wash away sorrow. The laugh of a dragon will  always bring joy…</em>” Rei turned away from Zhu Shu, her eyes once more resting  on the altar, her voice dropping even lower. “<em>Beware the love of a dragon, for only the worthy survive…</em>”<p>
  “<em>Yet one dragon  loved shall never die…</em>” Zhu Shu finished as Rei’s voice trailed off. “My  mother would sing me to sleep with that song when nightmares woke me as a  child… before she… before she and father died. It has never failed to comfort  me with a sense of the Dragon’s presence, even here so far from home. I have  never heard it from anyone before. How come you to know it?” <p>
  Rei shook her head. “It’s been stuck in my head ever  since I took care of you after the fight… ever since I had a vision when I  touched my symbol in your tattoo. Now whenever I see you I hear that song,  and…” her voice trailed off for a long moment. “By my ancestors, Zhu Shu! I’m  so confused!” She buried her face in her hands.<p>
  “Do you want me?” Zhu Shu asked quietly.<p>
  “I don’t know.” came Rei’s strangled reply. She stood  and started to walk forward. “Gods! I’m sorry Zhu Shu… You came here to get  away from stuff like this.”<p>
  “Wait.” came Zhu Shu’s soft reply. Rei stopped and  turned. Zhu Shu stood and stepped up to the taller girl. “What did you see?”  her eyes held a plea as she gazed into the priestess’s violet eyes.<p>
  Rei closed her eyes. “I saw a girl with cherry  blossoms in her pink hair… I saw Akane with a pair of tiger pommeled swords… I  saw… a ring of fire surrounded by the symbols of the Senshi being swallowed in  darkness… and I saw… The Dragon.” Her voice hesitated. “There was more, I know,  but I can’t remember it.” She opened her eyes to look at Zhu Shu sadly. “I  don’t know what any of it means.” She turned and made as if to leave again.<p>
  “Rei?” Zhu Shu’s voice again stopped her.<p>
  “Yes Zhu-chan?” Rei asked quietly.<p>
  “Why have you never told me?”<p>
  Rei knew instinctively that Zhu Shu wasn’t referring  to her vision.  She laid a hand against a  pillar and whispered, “Because I never had a chance.  You love Akane and Ranma. Gods, Zhu Shu, how  could I compete with that? Compared to Akane, I’m a graceless cow.  She’s learned everything you’ve taught her  and I can’t even finish my kata without messing up.” She laid her head against  the pillar. “And I can’t even honestly make up my mind if I’m in love with you  or not! How could I possibly ask you out on a date or anything? I can’t even  get up the courage to ask Yuuchiriou out! And he’s a boy!”<p>
  “I see.” Zhu Shu sat back down on the bench. “Rei…  There is no shame in being confused. You are young yet. It is hard to know what  your feelings are during this time of your life.”<p>
  Rei sighed. “Don’t you think I know that? I’ve told  myself that a thousand times.  Then I  dream about you, or I watch you during classes and think about how you looked  performing your kata that morning, and then I don’t know how I feel any  more.  Other than how much of a fool I  am.”<p>
  Zhu Shu whispered something too faintly for Rei to  hear, but suddenly, light was pouring over her shoulder. Unable to resist, she  turned to look at the source of the glow.<p>
  A vision of herself stood before her, a mirror image,  yet what it showed was far more than just a simple reflection. Her vision self  stood naked, her slender form clothed only in wisps of flame. Wings of fire  fluttered from her back, their slight motions leaving trailers of flame. A  sense of presence emanated from the figure, seemingly vulnerable and untried,  yet a strength stronger than steel hid within it. It reminded her of a flower,  still in bud, but on the verge of blooming into something indescribably  beautiful…<p>
  “You asked me once how I could tell who you were both  in and out of costume.” Zhu Shu said quietly. “I told you then that I could see  your aura, but there is more to it than just colors, Rei-chan, at least for me.  This is how I see you, how I see <em>everyone</em>.  This is my curse, Rei, my dragon-sight. When someone lies to me, or is ill, I  can see it in their aura, just as I can when someone tells the truth. Akane’s  gained a small part of this ability, to be able to see colors, but I see it  all… Look at yourself, Rei. See yourself as I see you.” Zhu Shu shook her head.  “You are young, Rei, and unsure of yourself, that does not make you a fool.”<p>
  Rei was still staring at the vision. “How can you bear  it? How can you stand to see that way?”<p>
  Zhu Shu shrugged. “Like all things, you grow  accustomed to it in time.” She let the illusion go. “Rei… I knew from the  beginning that you were curious, but I did not wish to play with your emotions.  I am terrified I will hurt you, Rei. My duty is to produce an heir, I must  eventually marry a man, no matter how I feel about them. I could not marry  Ranma because I love him, and my lack of passion would only cause him pain. I  could see that as clearly as I can see you.” Her voice trailed off as she  sighed. “Rei-chan. You are my friend… and I love you as such. I do not know if  I am ready to be more, if I <em>can</em> be  more, and I do not know if I will end up hurting you because of my obligations,  but if you wish to date me, I will not refuse you.”  She gave Rei a sadly gentle smile.  “I have no right to make up your mind for  you.  I-I have done that too much of  late.”<p>
  Rei’s gaze locked with hers for a long moment,  searching. Finally she nodded. “So it is up to me.” she laughed tiredly. “Now all I have to  do is make up my mind what I want… and to figure out if I dare to love a  dragon.”  She stepped away from the  pillar and met Zhu Shu’s golden gaze. “Well, at least you didn’t laugh at me.”<p>
  Zhu Shu blinked, then gave her a tired smile, her  green eyes lighting. “Rei-chan, you should have known I would never have done  that.” She stepped forward to give her a hug. “I may be your sensei, but I am  also, and always, your friend.”<p>
  Rei smiled. “Hey, Mina-chan’s latest Sailor-V movie is  premiering today. You wanna go?”<p>
  Zhu Shu chuckled. “There. See?  It wasn’t so hard to ask me on a date.”<p>
  Rei blinked. “Uh- well… yeah, I guess so.” She  blushed. “Um… I gotta clean up the shrine first before school-” She broke off  as she turned to look at the shrine, now finally illuminated by the early  morning light. “By my ancestors.”<p>
  Zhu Shu joined her in staring. On the floor where Zhu  Shu had been practicing, the wood had apparently reshaped itself. A pattern of  small wooden tiles now adorned the floor, seemingly as old as the floor itself.  Zhu Shu looked at Rei. “I didn’t do it. I don’t have that kind of ability.”<p>
  Rei shook her head. “I’ll just chalk it up as one more  of the many mysteries that surround you. But we better both go and tell  grandfather. He’s going to freak.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded and followed Rei out of the shrine, as  puzzled by the appearance of the Dragon mandala as Rei was.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Akane awoke from dreams of dragons and birds of fire  with a sense that something she couldn’t quite put a finger on had happened.  The depression she had been sensing faintly from her connection with Zhu Shu  had faded, replaced with a sense of acceptance and faint amusement. Wherever  she was, she at least seemed to be doing better. Akane stretched, still feeling  a little wrung out from the events of the day before.  Between the wild mood caused by the lingering  effects of Kodachi’s drugged bouquet that had led to a couple of hours of sex  play with Ranma in girl form, and the whirlwind of activity that had resulted  in her and Ranma’s betrothals to Shan Pu, she had been exhausted last night.  She had spent the night dreaming a confused  mélange of memories of teaching Ranma how to use her tongue and her own initial  ravishment of the cute red-head.  It had  been so wonderful to have Ranma’s body pressed against her, so warm and soft  and well rounded.  She could almost still  feel-<p>
  She blinked, realizing she <em>could </em>feel a warm, soft presence curled against her back.  She racked her brains trying to figure out if  the one glass of sake she had drunk could have fogged out her memories, then  rolled over to find herself face to face with Shan Pu, curled up on the bed  against her.  Purple hair curled around  her face as sleepy eyes opened and she looked at Akane. “Ni hao, Ai Ren,” she  said softly, her little girl’s voice sounding almost like a purr as she smiled  sleepily. <p>
  Downstairs, Kasumi looked up at the scream, then heard  the sound of Akane’s door slamming as steps came storming down the stairs.  Akane burst into the kitchen and stopped. “That… That… <em>AMAZON!</em>”<p>
  “Oh, my, Akane. What ever happened?”<p>
  “<em>Shan Pu!</em> She  snuck into my bedroom last night and crawled into bed with me!”<p>
  “Oh, my.”<p>
  Shan Pu stuck her head in the kitchen. “Why is Ai Ren  angry?  Is what couples do.”<p>
  Akane sputtered. “Shan Pu!!! We won’t be engaged for a  week!”<p>
  Shan Pu stepped into the kitchen, revealing she was  completely naked.  “Humph… Akane not seem  have problem with other fiancé.  Shan Pu  hear what Akane and Ranma do yesterday. Why not do with Shan Pu?”<p>
  Akane blushed furiously. “I was still under the  influence of some kind of drug!  And I  barely know you!”<p>
  Shan Pu stepped closer, swaying her hips seductively.  “Is simple remedy.”<p>
  Akane couldn’t help but notice the lush swaying of  Shan Pu’s full breasts, nearly as large as Zhu Shu’s, and the small tuft of  violet that proved Shan Pu’s hair color was natural.  Her jaw hung slightly slack for a second as  she blushed even brighter, then muttered “I’m going to the dojo!” as she turned  and fled.<p>
  Shan Pu pouted and crossed her arms. “What do wrong?”  she asked of no-one in particular.<p>
  “I think you just may have come on too strong, dear.”  Kasumi said helpfully. “Akane’s the kind to resist if you come across as too  forward.”<p>
  Shan Pu put her hands on her hips.  “Is Amazon way! Warriors are direct! Akane is  fiancée like Ranma.  Why she no want play  with Shan Pu?”<p>
  Kasumi looked her over. “I don’t know, dear. But maybe  you should try being more subtle.   Crawling into her bed naked may not be the best way.  Lovely as you are, Akane’s not used to  admitting she’s attracted to girls yet.”<p>
  Shan Pu sat down at the table and sighed.  “Great-grandmother tell Shan Pu should win Akane’s heart first, or be much  jealousy… Shan Pu thought being good fiancée.   Shan Pu <em>want</em> be good fiancée.”<p>
  Kasumi looked at the miserable Chinese girl. She was  completely sincere, and as far as Kasumi could tell, was telling the plain  truth.  And… she <em>was</em> Zhu Shu’s adopted sister, and sooner or later, Shan Pu would be  hers as well. Plus Zhu Shu trusted her enough to arrange for her to marry Ranma  and Akane. <p>
  Besides, she hated to see anyone unhappy. “Maybe I can  help…”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Akane was nearly three quarters done with a morning  workout before she realized she was copying Zhu Shu’s routine perfectly. She’d  come into the dojo, stripped out of her house coat, picked a pair of Zhu Shu’s  beribboned wooden broadswords from the practice rack, stepped into the practice  area naked, and begun the intricate steps of the Song school of sword  dance.  She missed a step when she  realized what she was doing, but reflexes took over and she corrected.  She was amazed at herself.  The memories she had absorbed from Zhu Shu  had gone deeper than she had realized.   She hadn’t even thought about doing the early morning exercises, they  had just seemed the natural thing to do after waking.   She lost herself in the dance as she  pondered the matter of Shan Pu.<p>
  The traces of Zhu Shu’s memories of her travels with  the Amazon showed her how passionate Shan Pu could be.  She had been a warm and cuddly sleeping  partner, and had let Zhu Shu know she was more than willing for more intimate  companionship, but had been accepting of the fact that Zhu Shu had felt it  necessary to put off her original proposal of becoming her sister-wife.  She had sparred with Zhu Shu and spent hours  talking about how much she was looking forward to finding Ranma so they could  be happy together.  She had always been  bright and cheery, and no matter how frustrated she had gotten at Ranma’s  eluding them, she had never had an unkind word for her blood-sister.  She could change moods in a second, but there  was no way to doubt that once she had given her heart, it was forever.<p>
  And Shan Pu certainly had had no reservations about  showing her affection.  Only Kasumi’s  hand on her shoulder had kept her from jumping up and booting the Amazon into  orbit when she had locked lips with Ranma following the ceremony.  At least the fact that the startled boy had  tried to fight the relentless kiss had reassured her somewhat that Ranma was  just as uncomfortable with Shan Pu.  He’d  failed to get out of the kiss though, and somewhere after minute five, Akane  had decided she really was in need of that cup of sake.<p>
  Still, Shan Pu had <em>tried</em> to be just as affectionate to her.  Akane  had just been better at avoiding the very cuddly Amazon.  Then when they had found Zhu Shu had gone, it  had put a damper on being <em>too</em> celebratory.  They had still had a nice  night as Ranma had told his mother about some of his travels and the Amazon  Loremaster had told tales.  Even her very  drunken father had listened raptly, while Shan Pu had tried to sit and hold  onto Akane’s arm.  Akane resisted, but  Shan Pu had given her a calculating look and watched her closely the rest of  the night.  Akane hadn’t been able to  avoid the impression of being a mouse sized up by a cat.  <p>
  And this morning certainly showed Shan Pu wasn’t going  to be put off.  She was going to have to  decide how to deal with her sometime…<p>
  A polite cough drew her attention to the side of the  mat.  Shan Pu stood next to the mat,  holding her bon buri, but otherwise still naked.  Akane blushed slightly, but gazed back at the  Chinese girl defiantly.<p>
  “Shan Pu only see Zhu Shu use techniques before.  Shan Pu spar much with Zhu Shu.  Will Akane spar?”  Her kittenish voice almost dripped with  eagerness.<p>
  Akane considered, unwilling to back down before the  warrior girl.  “Any other laws of the  Amazons I should know about first?”<p>
  Shan Pu shook her head as she smiled.  “Is already betrothed.  No can challenge to marriage duel.”<p>
  “I meant more along the line of death stuff.”<p>
  Shan Pu laughed.   “Akane is Ai Ren.  No would kill  Ai Ren.  Just spar.”  She looked at Akane avidly, the desire to  test herself against Akane’s skill apparent in her eyes.<p>
  Akane shrugged.   The damage had already been done.   They were going to be betrothed in six days whatever she thought.  And… she knew there was a question they <em>both</em> needed answered.  Maybe having this resolved would give her a  clue to figuring out the Amazon.  “Why  not.”<p>
  Shan Pu nodded and bowed before stepping onto the mat  and assuming a stance.  Akane took the  chance to study her for a long moment.   She really was beautiful, easily a match for Zhu Shu, but she had a  hardness Zhu Shu lacked.  Her muscles  were more defined, and her moves spoke of a lot of power carefully  controlled.  Her large breasts swayed  slightly with her breath, their nipples partially erect.  Akane took in her stance, her eyes following  up long legs to the tangle of violet curls, then up to meet Shan Pu’s  eyes.  The small bell ornaments in Shan  Pu’s purple hair chimed softly in time with the ones in Akane’s braid as their  eyes held each other, searching.  There  was silence as for a long second neither girl moved, then they simultaneously  attacked.<p>
  In a blur of motion, Akane intercepted Shan Pu’s right  bon buri as her other sword flickered towards Shan Pu’s head. Shan Pu dodged  behind her, her second bon buri flashing at Akane’s legs, but Akane flipped  over the swing and curled around the other weapon as Shan Pu tried to intercept  her in mid-air. She flipped and landed out of Shan Pu’s range as they guarded  again.<p>
  Shan Pu licked her lips, her nipples hard as rocks.  “You good.” was her only comment.<p>
  Akane launched herself, her body spinning as her blade  arched towards Shan Pu, then reversing her spin as the blade was intercepted.  Shan Pu threw herself into an aerial cartwheel over the blade and launched an  attack at Akane’s extended arm. Akane’s whirl carried her arm out of the way as  both blades circled towards where Shan Pu’s legs would land.<p>
  Shan Pu bounced into a high split over the swords and  attempted a counterstrike at Akane’s head. Akane blurred out of the way as the  floorboards erupted from the air pressure of the missed blow. She continued her  cart wheels as Shan Pu launched a rapid fire series of jabs, exploding the  floor just behind her elusive opponent. As Akane did a high flip over Shan Pu,  the Chinese girl took a deep breath and seemed to blur.<p>
  Akane dodged the first of the series of lightning fast  blows as instincts took over and the world slowed to a crawl. She parried blow  after blow, the air growing as thick as molasses as waves slowly rippled out  from behind their furiously striking weapons. Then, as the waves met and merged  in a dull rumble, a vast surge blew them apart.<p>
  Time resumed its normal flow as they both rolled in  the air and the dull rumble became the roar of a sonic boom. The walls of the  dojo ripped apart in the angry wind, swirling paper around the two girls as  they landed with barely a thump. For a long second, only their hair moved in  the swirling wind, then they blurred again.<p>
  Shan Pu managed to deflect the slashing blades, but  realized her mistake as the long ribbons attached to the pommels wrapped around  the hilts of her bon buri and with a wrench they were gone. Out of the corner  of her eye, she watched as they narrowly missed Ranma, who had frozen outside  the dojo in shock.<p>
  Shan Pu flipped over Akane’s head and back flipped out  of the immediate reach of her swords to land in a crouch.  “Hah!   Shan Pu not need weapon!”  She  returned to the fray with a volley of kicks and punches that Akane was hard  pressed to avoid, then her return attack with her ribbons was caught by Shan  Pu, and her swords were wrenched out of her hands and hurled across the  room.  Akane bounced back out of Shan  Pu’s range and the two girls circled warily.<p>
  “You match Zhu Shu in blade.”  Shan Pu admitted.  “But Song school have big weakness.  No sword, no defense.”  She smiled as she attacked once more.<p>
  Akane smiled grimly as she blocked the first attack  and reposted with a kick that Shan Pu had to leap to avoid.  “Maybe, but I’m also a student of Anything  Goes!” <p>
  In a blur of kicks and punches, block and counter  block, they whirled around the dojo, the air once more turning to molasses. </p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Soun and Genma arrived at a dead run to find the two  girls moving almost too fast to see through the shattered walls of the  dojo.  They joined Ranma in an open mouth  gape at the display.<p>
  “Soun.  When did  you teach Akane that?”  Genma whispered  in awe.<p>
  “I didn’t know I <em>had</em>.”  Soun whispered back.<p>
  All Ranma could see was that all traces of the awkward  tomboy he’d fought on his first day at the Tendo’s was gone.  Akane’s style had merged with Zhu Shu’s grace  and fluidness to give her a kinesthetic all her own.  She moved with all the lethal elegance of a  tigress, right down to the lashing tail of her braid.  To him, she had never seemed more beautiful.<p>
  And Shan Pu…   He’d never had a chance to appreciate how skilled she was.  He’d taken advantage of her tiredness to get  in a quick power shot that had knocked her off the challenge pole.  Now, watching her fighting Akane, he realized  he might have had an entirely different kind of match had she not just won  several challenges in a row.  He was  confident that he still would have beaten her, but he would have been in bad  shape afterwards. And seeing her in this light, he was struck by how beautiful  she was as well…<p>
  Nodoka Saotome arrived on the scene finally, her  kimono in disarray from a hurried dressing, and her sword half drawn.  “What is going on?  It sounded like a bomb went-  Oh my…”   Her voice trailed off in amazement as well. <p>
  A shimmering golden globe shattered a support and  resolved itself into Akane.  She spun in  mid-air to land on her feet and launched herself straight up as Shan Pu’s kick  ploughed into the ground where she had landed.   Shan Pu launched herself upwards after Akane, but was met in mid-leap  and borne to the ground. They froze, Shan Pu on her back looking up at the hand  Akane had poised to strike, her eyes locked on the long, glowing gold claws that  had sprung from Akane’s fingertips. Her eyes dropped down to meet Akane’s, a  fire burning in them like none Akane had ever seen. <p>
  “You conquer Shan Pu, Ai Ren” she almost purred as she  relaxed from fighting tension. She stretched her arms languorously above her  head and lifted her breasts into Akane’s view. “She yours yet again. Is fight  Shan Pu <em>should</em> have had.”<p>
  Akane’s blush broke her hold on her ki, and the claws  vanished. “What do you mean?”<p>
  Shan Pu reached out to stroke the small bells along  Akane’s dangling braid “Shan Pu no lose to fluke. Shan Pu conquered as Amazon  should be.” Her eyes met Akane’s again, the need in them intense. She raised  her hand to Akane’s cheek and attempted to draw her down for a kiss, heedless  of the others.<p>
  Feeling trapped by Shan Pu’s obvious desire, and her  own conflicting feelings about the Chinese girl, Akane did the only thing she  could do… She ran.<p>
  Shan Pu cried out after her as she vanished, her hand  held out in longing, then she collapsed sobbing, her fist denting a rock as she  shattered it in frustration. “Shan Pu such fool! Fool! Fool! Fool!” she cried,  the rock reducing towards rubble with each exclamation.<p>
  Nodoka was the first to recover, and she tried to go  and comfort the sobbing Amazon, but the proud girl fled into the house as well.  Nodoka wrung her hands and sighed, then turned to the other three. “Quite a  pair of warriors.”<p>
  Ranma, Genma and Soun nodded. Creaks and groans came  from the dojo behind them.<p>
  “That my son bested the Amazon speaks volumes. That Akane  matched her is impressive as well. Ah, Ranma. I think your life is going to be  interesting. I am so proud!” She hugged him. <p>
  “Aw, mom.” Ranma blushed<p>
  “Just stay in shape. I’m already worried enough about  you surviving the wedding night, and I do expect grandchildren.” She turned and  re-entered the house as behind the men, the dojo gave a loud groan and  collapsed. <p>
  Kasumi peeked out of the door. “Oh, my. I suppose I  had better call the girls and inform them lessons are canceled today.” She  started to turn then stopped. “Oh, yes. Breakfast is ready as well.”<p>
  The dojo gave a last creak as Soun settled to his  knees and cried.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“So, she plans to go out socializing with one of the  Senshi.”  The figure in the mirror  mused.  Mara nodded.  <p>
  “Yes.  She will  be alone with her.”<p>
  “Which one?”<p>
  “Mars.”<p>
  The wizard growled.   “The Lady Phoenix… I should have guessed.  She always was attracted to the bitch.”  He steepled his fingers.  “I have things I must oversee here, but I  think we should not let our nuisance be free to enjoy herself.  Especially with Mars.”<p>
  Mara nodded.  “I  agree.  I have an imp I can send to annoy  them.  Anything more will alert the  goddess watching over her to my meddling.”<p>
  The wizard scowled.   “No.  I have something far more  entertaining in mind.”</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Urd pounded the keyboard in frustration. “Whaddaya  mean, Access Denied!?! I’m the Sysop!” Yelling at the screen seemed to have no  effect on the words it displayed, so with a scowl, Urd tried a different  tack.   She didn’t have any more success.<p>
  “Ok. File encrypted and password locked. <em>Alright</em> already.”  She pondered, wishing she had access to the  main board.  She glanced across the  control center to where Peorth was giving her a faintly amused look from the  center seat.  No use asking <em>her</em> for a favor.<p>
  She turned back to the substation screen and thought  of a different approach.  “Ok Yggy. <em>Who</em> encrypted it?”<p>
  Letters formed across the screen in answer to her  query, but nothing could have prepared her for what they said. <p>
  Her eyes were locked onto the screen for a long, long  time before she found the strength to whisper “Date?”<p>
  Again words appeared on the screen “August 27, 647 AD.”<p>
  A long time after that, she stood up and numbly moved  out of the Yggdrasil mainframe, totally oblivious to the look Peorth gave  her.  The other goddess raised an eyebrow  at Urd’s strange behavior and called up a copy of the substation’s screen.  She blinked, then looked after the departing  goddess, her eyes narrowing.  <p>
  A few minutes later, Urd formed out of the TV in the  living room and collapsed into her favorite chair.<p>
  Belldandy found her there an hour later, still  unmoving. “Urd?” she asked, concern written across her features.<p>
  “I went to ask Yggdrasil about that Amazon legend.”  Urd said faintly.<p>
  “Oh?” Belldandy was confused. Urd was in a major  shock, and she couldn’t see how a story over a thousand years old could have  caused such a reaction. “What did you find?”<p>
  “The file’s encrypted…”<p>
  “Humm… I’m sure Father had his reasons.”<p>
  “Kami-sama didn’t encrypt it.”<p>
  Belldandy raised an eyebrow. Urd was one of  Yggdrasil’s primary Sysops. She had all the passwords, even on probation. “But,  who? Peorth?”<p>
  Urd’s eyes met Belldandy’s. “<em>I</em> did.”<p>
  Belldandy blinked in confusion, then drew in her  breath at Urd’s next words.<p>
  “The file was encrypted by order of Sysop, Goddess,  First Class, Unlimited, Urd…”<p>
  <p>
  * * * * *</p>
<p>Akane sat on her bed, thinking about the events of  that morning. After her bout with Shan Pu, she had more or less gone through  the school day in a daze, trying to sort out the welter of emotions the fight  had brought out. <p>
  For one thing, it had shown her exactly how deeply the  skills she had absorbed from Zhu Shu had ingrained themselves into her.  The training for speed and ki techniques of  the Song school, and the even more acrobatic forms of Shiva’s Dance had blended  with her training in Anything Goes to enable her to hold her own with the  Amazon.  The ease with which she had used  those skills had frightened her and thrilled her at the same time.  She had occasionally damaged the dojo before  by putting a hole in the wall, or breaking a board here or there, but she and  Shan Pu had leveled the place.  That was  the kind of property damage she would associate with Usagi and the other  Senshi… or their enemies.  Even Kuno at  his worst couldn’t level buildings so quickly.   Had she met Shan Pu with only the training she had received from her  father, she would have been slaughtered.<p>
  And Ranma had beaten her <em>without</em> Zhu Shu’s abilities, just his own training in Anything  Goes. And if he could be believed, he’d beaten her quickly.<p>
  She understood now how he could view Kuno with  contempt.<p>
  It threw into bold relief just how lackadaisical her  training in Martial Arts had been in comparison.  Yes, her dad had taught her everything he had  known, had made her the best martial artist in Furinkan, but he had never  pushed her.<p>
  No.  To be fair,  she had never made him push her.  She had  never had the all consuming drive to be the best that had driven Ranma and Shan  Pu.  She could have spent years training  and never have caught up to them.  <p>
  But now?  Zhu  Shu had told her that Shan Pu could beat her easily in unarmed combat, but  Akane had held her own… and won.<p>
  No… she had been evenly matched… but Shan Pu had  acknowledged defeat.<p>
  Maybe she’d been wrong about Shan Pu’s reasons for  wanting to spar. At first she had thought the Amazon had wanted a little  revenge for losing to Akane the day before, and for Akane’s reaction on finding  her naked in bed, but now she didn’t think so. It had been more like she had  wanted to meet her as an equal, which was why she’d met her with nothing more  than Akane had - weapons alone. <p>
  Shan Pu hadn’t fought at anything less than her best,  but it seemed she had wanted to lose… she had <em>needed</em> to lose after giving her all. She had needed to prove to  herself that she had given her love to someone worthy.  She was an Amazon, and the Champion; her  pride demanded she give herself only to the best.<p>
  And Akane had proven to her that she was <em>at least</em> an equal. She had not needed to  win to know who was truly better, the fight alone had proven her love was  worthy. She hadn’t cared who was there other than Akane. She had desired only  to be taken with a passion as wild as the fury of their fight. She had <em>needed</em> to be taken.<p>
  And the depth of her need had frightened Akane.<p>
  She’d been forced into this engagement, even if by her  own actions. She’d been deliberately corrupted by Zhu Shu to make her amenable  to the idea of a female lover, even if she did love Zhu Shu too much to really  be angry about it. She’d been manipulated by the old ghoul Shan Pu called her  Great-grandmother into begging for her life… <p>
  No. The parts of her that were touched by Zhu Shu  wouldn’t let her take the easy way out. Zhu Shu had never done anything more  than be a friend. Akane had been the one to make the decisions. Shan Pu had  only jumped to Ranma’s defense - much as Akane might have done. Akane had only  herself to blame for knocking Shan Pu out. Had it not been for her ties to  Ranma and Zhu Shu, Shan Pu would have given her the kiss of death. And now?  Shan Pu was only trying to win the heart of someone she had already given hers  to…<p>
  Could Akane really be angry with Shan Pu for trying to  do with her what she had already tried to do with Zhu Shu? And had succeeded at  with Ranma?<p>
  She sighed and laid back on her bed as the whirlwind  in her head continued…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“Well I still say it’s weird.” Usagi said to Minako.  “I mean why would she want to take Zhu-chan to a movie and not want the rest of  us to go, too?” <p>
  “Usagi, you can be so dense. Zhu Shu came to her last  night because she was so upset about stuff over at Akane’s. She needed a break,  and peace and quiet.  You can’t sit  through a movie without running commentary and at least five trips to the  concession stand for more popcorn.” Minako replied.<p>
  “So why’d she get so dressed up?” Usagi pouted.<p>
  Makoto looked up from the stove where she was cooking.  “Think about it, Usagi. You know how Zhu Shu looks <em>before</em> she puts on make up… and they were going to that nice restaurant  in the ginza after the movie. Rei had to dress nice to even get in there.”<p>
  Usagi harumphed. Minako giggled. “I think you’re just  sore she wanted to go alone.”<p>
  Usagi curled into a knot of arms and legs. “Well… I  wanted to see the movie.”<p>
  “No… you wanted Rei to <em>pay</em> for you to see the movie.” Makoto called. “Now go set the  table. Dinner’s almost done.”<p>
  Minako sighed and got up. “Come on Usagi.”<p>
  “Aww, do I have to? My butt still hurts.”<p>
  “Then you should have known better than to ask Rei if  she had become a pervert and was she really taking Zhu Shu on a date.” Makoto  said unsympathetically.<p>
  Minako giggled, receiving a glare from a red faced  Usagi. “Hey!”<p>
  “Oh, come on Usagi-chan. It was funny watching Rei  turn you over her lap and paddle you. I should have taken pictures. Lots of  magazines would pay good money for them.” Minako’s eyes danced. “Loli s&amp;m,  doncha know.”<p>
  “YOU WOULDN’T DARE!!!” Usagi yelled, then  reconsidered. “Would you?”<p>
  The other two girls howled with laughter, but broke  off as Ami came into the small kitchen dining room of Makoto’s apartment.<p>
  “Hey guys? This is pretty weird.” She looked up at a  beet red Usagi, then at the other two girls swallowing giggles, and asked “Did  I miss something?”<p>
  “They’re being mean!” Usagi wailed.<p>
  “Oh… well… I think you might want to look at this.”  She waved the little mini-computer in her hand. “We might even want to call in  Artemis and Luna.”<p>
  The other three girls got serious in a hurry. “What is  it Ami-chan?” Makoto asked.<p>
  “I was running some comparative analysis on my scans  for the last few months - just routine maintenance and file management really -  and... well... I’d really rather only try to explain this once, but I think it <em>might </em>be important.”<p>
  That was enough for the others. By the time dinner was  out, the two felines had arrived.<p>
  “What is it Sailor Mercury? We haven’t monitored any  suspicious activity…”<p>
  Ami shook her head. “I’ve been going over my sensor  logs.” She had plugged her mini computer to Makoto’s wallscreen and with a few  key taps brought up an image of Zhu Shu standing on the roof of Hikawa Shrine.  Next to it, a sensor trace appeared with labels indicating what the various  colors meant. “This is what Zhu-sensei read when we first met her. As you can  see, she has absolutely no trace of negative energy, but extremely high levels  of what Rei said was chi, and strong traces of magical energy. At the time,  there was a last trace I ignored as unimportant.” She pointed to a small white  trace barely visible at the bottom of the readout. “This is Silver Millennium  energy. It’s very faint and I dismissed it then because it’s fairly common to  find people with traces.  Anyone  descended from the Moon Kingdom survivors will have one.” She ran the log  forward to the point it had rained. “Here is where she transformed. As you can  see, the magic trace spiked off the scale for this one split second, but look  at the other traces.” <p>
  Mina said it first. “They aren’t there?”<p>
  Ami nodded. “Exactly. For this one instant, it appears  Zhu Shu exists only as magical energy.  The  curse apparently shifts her to a wholly immaterial form for a microsecond then  reforms her in the new one.  Even her DNA  is modified.  She is still essentially  Zhu Shu, but her genetic structure is that of a dragon-human crossbreed.” She  ran ahead a few frames to Zhu Shu’s dragon-girl form and the traces reappeared,  but even Usagi’s usually unobservant eyes could see the difference.  “Once she has resumed this alternate form,  her readings are quite altered.”<p>
  “Her bands have shifted.” Artemis observed.<p>
  “Yes. As you can see, her magic trace has climbed  almost two orders of magnitude, and note the absence of her chi trace. It  almost seems as if her change merges her chi into this strong magical trace.  I’m still trying to figure out exactly what that implies.” She added a split  screen of Rei. “For comparison, here’s Rei at the same time period.”<p>
  “Wow, she’s got a magic trace too!” Usagi noted.<p>
  Ami nodded. “Well, she is a priestess… but as you can  see, her major trace is Silver Millennium energy, about ten orders of magnitude  over Zhu-sensei.” She pressed a few buttons on the computer. “Now I’m going to  the readings a few days later, when we all came to the shrine to meet  Zhu-sensei.” The graphs shifted and Ami tapped the screen as she looked at them  seriously. <p>
  “I likely wouldn’t have noticed if I hadn’t been doing  comparisons, but like this, it’s rather obvious. Rei’s magic trace has elevated  substantially, but what’s really strange is this.” She pointed to the white  trace on Zhu Shu’s graph. “Zhu-sensei’s Silver Millennium trace also has  increased by nearly an order of magnitude.   I ran over the logs of the following week, and at first theorized that  our Sensei was an energy sponge.  I  thought it was possible that as she spends time with us, she gradually absorbed  small amounts of Silver Millennium energy.   The substantial spike following our initial encounter would thus have  been explained by her successfully absorbing most of Jupiter’s lightning  dragon, thereby avoiding serious injury.”<p>
  Makoto nodded.   “I can see that.  My attack  otherwise would likely have been fatal.”<p>
  Ami agreed.   “However, that does not seem to be an entirely accurate theory.”<p>
  She tapped a few more keys and the screen jumped ahead  to a time reference of just a few hours previous, and everyone gasped. Ami  looked grim. “This is our sensei today. As you can see, somehow, she’s  undergone a massive change. Her chi levels have leaped almost five orders of  magnitude and her magic trace has increased by almost twenty.  It is almost beyond my computer’ ability to  measure. Something very strange has happened to her and-”<p>
  “Hey! What happened to her Millennium trace?” Usagi  interrupted.<p>
  Ami nodded. “That is why I decided to show you all  this.” She tapped a few more keys and the other traces vanished to reveal the  previously hidden trace.<p>
  “Oh… my… gawd…” Usagi mumbled slack jawed. The others  wore equally shocked expressions.<p>
  The white trace was off the scale.<p>
  “Somehow our sensei’s levels of Silver Millennium  energy have exceeded my computer’s ability to measure it.  She is radiating almost as much as the Silver  Crystal.” <p>
  “Where are Rei and Zhu Shu now?” Luna asked quietly.<p>
  “They were going to see the new Sailor V movie and  then to dinner at the ginza.” Makoto supplied.<p>
  “We’ve got to get to them quick. We need to find out  what is going on.” Artemis said, his voice more serious than they had heard it  in weeks.<p>
  An alarm began beeping on Ami’s computer. She looked  down. “Oh no! I have a massive negative energy vortex building.”<p>
  “Where?” Luna’s voice had a tight edge.<p>
  “Juuban ginza.” Ami’s voice was as colorless as her  face.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“You’d think the way she carries on, Minako would be a  better actor.” Rei commented over her chow mien. “I mean, who writes her  scripts?”<p>
  Zhu Shu laughed, surprised at how much she was  enjoying herself.  Ever since her dream  of Ying-Ying, she had been pondering the advice her beloved’s ghost had given  her, and reviewing the last few weeks.   It had made her realize exactly how often she’d noticed looks from Rei  that she’d dismissed for no other reason than she was afraid of leading the  girl on.  She’d been so wrapped up in her  quest to help Ranma and Akane that she’d failed to see how much Rei had started  to look at her as more than just a friend.   She still wasn’t sure if Rei actually felt sexual desire for her, but  she certainly owed the other girl enough to allow Rei to discover if she did on  her own.  She had made a promise to  herself to allow the slender girl to lead their relationship, and to help in  whatever way she could without influencing Rei’s preferences.<p>
  When Rei had  come home from school and they had decided where to go eat, she had made an  effort to use some of her training to dress herself and Rei up.  Rei had blinked at the bewildering array of  cosmetics Zhu Shu had pulled out after she had set the younger girl down in  front of her mirror.  She had stared in  amazement at her own face when Zhu Shu had finished, unable to believe how  pretty she looked with a simple light blush and subtle eyeshadow.  Then Zhu Shu had dug into Rei’s closet and  found her an elegant red and gold Mandarin style dress and had added a set of  golden teardrop earrings to make the outfit complete.  Zhu Shu had chosen a more subdued dress in  midnight blue, deliberately attempting to ensure she looked as plain as  possible next to the taller raven-haired beauty.  The pair of them had turned all kinds of  heads that night, Zhu Shu smiling repeatedly at Rei’s blushes when various boys  had whistled at them, happily relinquishing the spotlight to her.  <p>
  “I don’t know,  Rei-chan. I thought it was very entertaining.” Zhu Shu answered. “It was  interesting to see her <em>pretending</em> to  fight. I will have to remember those moves when we train. It will help me to  train her better.”<p>
  “She was on wires most of the time, Zhu-chan. It  wasn’t real.”<p>
  “Yes… but there is no reason she can’t use what she  learned for that to help her out in training. Or combat.” Zhu Shu picked at her  so-called schezuan. She could make better in her sleep. “Anyway, I thought she  did a good job. It’s not <em>her</em> fault  they have her sounding like a cheap American superhero.”<p>
  “Except that I know she adlibs half her lines.” Rei  laughed. “You know, I’m actually having a lot of fun.” She smiled at Zhu Shu.<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “I was just thinking the same thing.  Maybe this was just what I needed… a complete break from-” She was cut off by  the sounds of screams from down the street, immediately followed by the  commotion of people running past the railing of the open air restaurant. A  shudder ran through the ground followed by the roar of something gigantic.<p>
  “Dammit!” Rei cursed. “Why <em>tonight</em> of all nights!” She stood and began to search for someplace  private, then she felt an arm wrap around her slim waist. <p>
  “Hold on.” Zhu Shu told her. Rei grabbed her as she  leaped, and tried to make herself as small as possible as Zhu Shu rebounded off  the wall. They bounced from wall to wall, gaining speed with each bounce until  they cleared the upper stories and landed on a rooftop halfway down the street.  Zhu Shu looked down at the girl in her arms and smiled. “Time to be a warrior.”<p>
  Rei smiled back.   “That was quite impressive.”  She  held up her wand and tapped Zhu Shu on the nose with it.  “Show off.”<p>
  Zhu Shu giggled.   “Maybe.”<p>
  Rei called out her transformation while still in Zhu  Shu’s arms, much to the Chinese girl’s surprise and Rei’s amusement.  Zhu Shu found herself caught in the midst of  the swirls of energy sweeping around the transforming Senshi, and with a  completely naked Rei pressed against her, still laughing as her Senshi uniform  started to form.  Zhu Shu felt a rush  through her as she felt the energy flow along her chi paths, warming her with  the heat of Rei’s fire.  As the henshin  finished, she found herself gasping in shock. <p>
  She gave Rei a wry look.  “Now who’s showing off?”<p>
  Rei giggled again, then looked off to the distance  where another roar could be heard.  “I’ll  be right back.”  She went to kiss Zhu  Shu’s cheek.<p>
  Zhu Shu had been turned to look towards the roaring,  and was turning back to Rei as she started to give her a peck, and as a result  their lips met.  There was a second of  shock, and Zhu Shu started to draw back, realizing Rei had meant to kiss her  cheek, but Rei moved with her, her hand rising to cup the back of Zhu Shu’s  head as she started to kiss her in truth.   Zhu Shu stopped resisting and returned it with growing feeling.<p>
  Rei broke after a minute and smiled.  “That… was wonderful.”<p>
  Zhu Shu blushed.   “That’s what I should say.”<p>
  Rei nodded.   “What say I go trounce whatever that is and we go back and finish our  date?”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “I would like that very much.” <p>
  Zhu Shu watched as Rei jumped to the roof of the next  building, reflecting on the sudden fire the kiss had seemed to ignite.  Whatever she and Rei eventually might become,  there was no denying there was at least <em>some</em> chemistry there.  <p>
  Another roar sounded, and she decided to follow Rei  and watch her student in action.  It was  just to study how she fought and see how she could improve her training class,  it certainly wasn’t because she wanted to watch the beautiful Senshi in action  in that <em>really</em> short skirt.  Not at all. </p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The imp roared happily as it ripped away another part  of the building away and dropped it down to nearly crush yet another running  human. It hadn’t had this much fun in centuries.  The wizard’s sending was feeding it enough  power that it felt invincible! Even holding to it’s current giant size was  child’s play. And with the havoc it was creating, its prey should be drawn to  it soon, her noble instincts wouldn’t let her stay away.<p>
  “Villain! Monster! For the suffering you have caused  innocents, in the name of Mars, I will make you pay!”<p>
  The imp looked up to a rooftop across the street from  it to see Sailor Mars. It laughed, a vast booming chuckle. Already, its lures  were arriving. The dragon girl couldn’t be far behind. “Will you stop me all by  yourself, meat?” The imp called as it shrugged off a Fire Soul.<p>
  “She is not alone, Villain!” Sailor Venus called from  behind it. “Crescent Beam Shower!”<p>
  The imp continued laughing as the golden rays of light  washed over it without effect . So all of its lures were coming to play. The  teacher had to be close. It shrugged off the effects of a Lightning Dragon as  it smiled. “So good of you all to come my little Senshi.” It waited as the five  girls surrounded it. “Now my pet!”<p>
  Only Usagi had time to scream as tentacles shot out of  shadows all over the rooftops and enveloped the quintet, then even that was cut  off as her mouth was clamped closed. They struggled, but for every tentacle  they wiggled free of, eight more clamped on.<p>
  “Do you like my little ally, Senshi?” The imp gloated.  “I would have thought you would have been more wary.  You fell into my trap so easily.”<p>
  A whistle and a sharp report announced the rose  bouncing off the imp’s scaly hide, followed by a pronouncement in a deep voice. <p>
  “Those who seek to destroy beauty may find instead  they are destroyed by it!”<p>
  The imp turned to Tuxedo Kamen, standing with the moon  dramatically behind him on a water tower . “How sweet. More bait.” It ignored  the spatter of roses as it lashed out at the tower under Tuxedo Kamen’s feet,  water spraying everywhere as the hollow shell burst. Mamoru flipped through the  air towards a new perch, but was snagged by a dozen tentacles and dragged down  into the shadowy mass that had almost completely enveloped the Senshi. The imp  laughed insanely. The dragon girl had to come now!<p>
  From out of the darkness overhead a flurry of ribbons  flickering with golden light lashed down to a call of “Ashura’s Whip!”<p>
  Roars of pain arose from the shadow beast as the light  ripped through dozens of tentacles, freeing the Senshi enough for them to  breathe. The imp screamed as pain rushed along the connection it had with the  unseen beast. It looked up at the source of it’s pain and howled.<p>
  Hovering in a whirlwind of ribbons was a golden haired  figure in a gold-skirted sailor suit.   Emerald dragon eyes fixed the creature with implacable anger.  Golden light poured down from the shimmering  globe of energy that surrounded the figure as she danced in the air, her arms  moving in a hypnotic pattern that almost made her seem to have six of them.  Then she spoke in a clear voice that cut through the howl of the imp.<p>
  “For crimes against life, and crimes against love, I  sentence you. In the name of the Dragon, you shall be destroyed.” The quiet  pronouncement held just a hint of sadness, but carried the finality of doom.  The figure put back her head and screamed. “Ashura’s Call!  Senshi!   Lend me your power!”<p>
  Rei responded with all the strength she could muster.  “Mars Firebird, Burn!” she called as a fiery phoenix flashed upwards into the  swirling vortex around the figure and vanished into the burning light.<p>
  “She can absorb our attacks!” Mercury yelled. “Mercury  Ice Bubbles, Blast!”<p>
  One by one, the Senshi added their attacks until the  figure glowed like the sun. The imp hurled fireball after fireball to no  effect. “What does it take to kill you!” it screamed as yet another fireball  was sucked into the glowing orb. The golden figure’s scream faded as the  ribbons around her pulsed with power, leaving streamers of plasma. In the  sudden silence, her voice seemed to echo forever.<p>
  “Shiva’s Dance, Final Attack. <em>SWORD OF HEAVEN</em>!”<p>
  The ribbons blazed into a mandala around the figure as  she flared brighter than the sun, then they lashed downward in a glowing arc. A  vast crescent of plasma speared towards the transfixed imp, then through him  and into the shadow beast.<p>
  For a second, the imp appeared unharmed as lightning  crackled through the shadow beast, then, as the shadows consumed themselves, it  slowly began to part. Arcs of energy lashed across the divide before it flared  into a concussive wave that flattened the Sailor Senshi, shattering the  building’s top and leaving not a trace of the imp behind.<p>
  Then above them, the golden figure flickered like a  dying ember and began to fall.<p>
  Rei screamed in denial as Zhu Shu crashed into the  rubble with a sickening thud, and scrambled in her direction heedless of her  own wounds and bruises.<p>
  Zhu Shu lay like a burned and broken doll in a pool of  her own blood, her spine severed by a jagged piece of concrete. She coughed, a  harsh rattling sound, and blood poured from her mouth. Her eyes opened to focus  on the priestess, and her hand rose shakily to brush Rei’s hair out of her  eyes. “I could not stand by and watch you die, Rei-chan… I… could… not bear-”  Her hand fell as her head rolled back, the light fading from her eyes.<p>
  In Nerima, Akane’s scream ripped out her soul…</p>
