<h1>I'll Be Your Fiancee (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cabbitblue.html">Cabbit Blue</a><br> </h2>
<pre>NOTE:  I&#39;ve changed the timeline such that Ranma and Genma arrive at
the dojo on a Friday, so there is no school until Monday, that
Saturday being an off day.

ADMONISHMENT:  Don&#39;t take this fic too seriously, folks, and
definitely don&#39;t try any of this at home. Writing it is dangerous
enough.


               -----=====&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; O &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=====-----


&quot;Well, I&#39;m just glad I wasn&#39;t beaten by a BOY!&quot; Akane smiled to
herself, as if it were some kind of private joke.

&quot;Uh...&quot;

~~Sniff.~~ &quot;You need to take a bath, Ranma-san. When was the last?&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I thought. Follow me.&quot;

Scratching her head, Ranma followed the strange girl out of the dojo
and into the house. Akane handed her a towel and guest bathing
utensils.

&quot;In you go. Take your time.&quot;

&quot;Um, thanks, Akane. I-- EEP!&quot; Ranma whirled around and stared, but
Akane was already walking down the hallway. &quot;Huh... I musta just
imagined that hand slidin&#39; over my ass.&quot;

Slightly confused, Ranma entered the changing room.

                        -----=====-----

&quot;Careful, careful...&quot; Akane silently slid the door the bathing room
open a crack and put her eye to the opening.

*Oh, kami, she&#39;s magnificent! Such pale skin. Such wonderful...
Mmmm...*

In the bathing room, Ranma soaped herself down, scrubbing her petite
form vigorously. Akane watched, mesmerized.

Ranma rinsed, and then stood, walking around to the front of the
furo. She raised her well-shaped right leg and dipped her dainty
foot into the warm water.

&quot;Aaah.&quot;

The rest of her leg went in past her knee, and something happened.
Ranma&#39;s body rippled, growing and changing form. Akane wanted to
scream: No! NO!! Bring back the beautiful girl! However, what
replaced the beautiful redhead captured her attention all over
again.

*Oh... my...* Corded muscles rippled across his body, and as Ranma
turned to face the door and bring his other leg into the furo, Akane
got an eyeful. She froze, replaying the scene in her mind, over and
over.

*Nobody&#39;s that big... Nobody&#39;s that big... Nobody&#39;s that big...* She
finally fell backwards on her rump.



Ranma swirled the furo water with his hand and made a decision. &quot;I
guess I should just go out like this and-- What was that?&quot;

He peered around the room. *Someone&#39;s watching me. I can feel it!*
He carefully turned his head, this way and that, and discovered the
sensation was radiating from the door. Through the steam, he could
barely see that the door had been cracked open.

&quot;Who&#39;s there?!&quot;

The sound of retreating footsteps echoed softly, and Ranma groused
to himself, &quot;WHAT is going ON?!&quot;

                        -----=====-----

&quot;Well, your problem&#39;s not so bad, after all. HAHA! This is Kasumi,
nineteen, Nabi--&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take her-- him-- both... whatever.&quot;

Kasumi and Nabiki instantly relaxed.

&quot;You... You... WHAT?!&quot; Ranma sputtered. &quot;Uh... Why? Yeah! Why?!&quot;

Akane shrugged. &quot;I like variety.&quot;

Ranma and Genma face-faulted, while the other Tendou family members
rolled their eyes.

&quot;And she _isn&#39;t_ kidding, Ranma-kun,&quot; Nabiki drawled. &quot;You&#39;re a gift
from the gods for Akane.&quot;

&quot;Thank Kamisama,&quot; Soun muttered. &quot;Now we can have a normal house...
sort of.&quot; He began to wail in joy, streams of tears arcing through
the air from both sides of his head.

Ranma moaned from the floor.

                        -----=====-----

&quot;Do... Do you think I&#39;m cute?&quot;

Ranma froze in the process of unloading his pack. His head cranked
around to see Akane in the doorway, wearing... wearing... nothing
underneath an untied and open robe, the hems of either side hanging
off the peaks of her breasts and the backlighting showing the gap
between her legs all the way up to--

&quot;ACK!!!&quot; In a spray of nasal blood, Ranma keeled over.

Giggling, Akane said, &quot;I&#39;ll take that as a provisional yes.&quot;

Ranma moaned from the floor.
