-------------------------------------------------

        &quot;I still can&#39;t do it,&quot; Akane complained as the ribbon missed the
target by an inch.  When she did hit the target, she usually couldn&#39;t muster
enough force to knock it down.

        &quot;Akane, you&#39;re holding the ribbon too much like it&#39;s a whip.  Hmm,
let me think of something,&quot; Kodachi said as she thought for a second.  It
was strange how she had gone from being Akane&#39;s rival to her
instructor.  After their match a few days ago, Kodachi had mentioned to
Akane that she needed a bit more training if she were to ever win.  It
was a minor insult Kodachi often gave to the opposing gymnast and could
never break out of her habit.  However, Ranma had pounced on the idea,
agreeing thoroughly.  The three of them ended up training together after
school every other day.

        &quot;I think I&#39;ve got it,&quot; Kodachi paused in her instruction and headed
over to the side of the room where various weapons had been set aside
for their practice session.  She found the leather coil after only a
short moment.

        Akane blushed as she looked at the familiar coil the other girl
brought over to her.  When she had taken all the weapons she could find in 
her room to the dojo for practice, she must have accidentally also taken the
whip.

        &quot;Here, try it with this Akane.  Be careful of the handle.  There&#39;s
some wet substance on it,&quot; Kodachi said, wiping her hands on the towel she
had over her neck, used for wiping off her sweat.

        &quot;There is?  Ah, I spilled some orange juice on the floor of my room
last night.  I guess I didn&#39;t get all of it when I mopped the floor,&quot;
Akane said nervously.  She quickly uncoiled the whip before anymore
questions could be asked.  She then proceeded to knock the empty bottle
on the far side of the dojo down with a single slash of her whip.  She
proceeded in the same fashion with various other items Kodachi had set
up for her.

        &quot;My, you are very good with that, Akane,&quot; Kodachi applauded
appreciatively.  &quot;The heavier weight would also make it fly much faster
through the air then my ribbon.  You must have used it many times.&quot;

        Akane faltered, before realizing that Kodachi didn&#39;t mean it _that_
way.  She sighed with relief as her new sensei didn&#39;t ask her how she
came to be this good with the whip.  It was still strange calling
another girl her own age, sensei.  But Akane had to admit, Kodachi was
better in the use of weaponry than she was.  On the other hand, Akane
excelled at hand-to-hand and when it came time for them to train in that
area, Kodachi would call her, teacher.

        Kodachi nodded to herself critically as Akane proceeded to
demonstrate her ability.  The girl really was quite amazing.  Kodachi 
recalled the girls she led on the gymnastics team.  There was not a single 
one of them that Kodachi was proud to boast as having taught.  However, 
there was no hiding her pride as she continued to watch Akane.  The girl 
had a natural aptitude in using tools in battle like conditions.  It was 
true it took her awhile to get used to the strangeness of every new item
Kodachi presented, but she improved at a rate that was remarkable given
her known clumsiness.

        &quot;Oww!&quot; Ranma cried out as she walked into the dojo.  &quot;Watch where
you&#39;re aiming.&quot;

        &quot;Sorry, Ranma,&quot; Akane said sheepishly as she lowered her whip and
went over towards her fianc&eacute;e to see if she was alright.  &quot;I didn&#39;t see you
come in.&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s okay, Akane.  It&#39;s just a small nick,&quot; Ranma quickly said
before Akane could lay any guilt on herself.  Ranma placed a hand over
her rump and it only stung a bit.  *Was there a mark?* she wondered
fearfully.  She did not want anything bad to happen to this god given
gift of hers.

        Kodachi suddenly felt heat rise up to her face as Ranma started to
lower her pants down to the ground to check on the condition of her butt
no doubt.  It was true that they were all girls, but still... Kodachi
bent her head unconsciously lower, getting a better look in the process.

        *It seems Ranma still hadn&#39;t gotten a hang of the finer points of
feminine modesty,* Akane thought to herself.  However, Akane found that
her voice had mysteriously disappeared when she approached Ranma to give
the girl a reprimand.  Her heart thumped in her ears as those black
pants her fianc&eacute;e was fond of wearing pooled down to the floor.  She
blinked.

        &quot;Oh, good.  See, just a little redness nothing serious,&quot; Ranma said
as she looked down.  &quot;Anyway, you guys mind another sparring partner?&quot;  She
proceeded to take the rest of her clothes off, revealing a rather tight
fitting leotard underneath.  &quot;What are you two looking at?  There&#39;s a
bigger mark there than I thought?&quot;

        &quot;Uh, nothing,&quot; Kodachi said, a hint of disappointment in her voice.
She should have known that Ranma would not just take her clothes off at
a drop of a hat.  Decent girls just didn&#39;t flash themselves out in
public.

        &quot;Yeah, nothing,&quot; Akane said after finally finding her voice back.
&quot;It&#39;s really alright.  Not a very big mark there.&quot;

        Ranma didn&#39;t like the way the two girls were fidgeting.  They were
just trying to make her feel better.  &quot;You sure?  You can get a better look
than me.  Can you check to make sure?  If it&#39;s really bad, can one of
you help me put some ointment on it?&quot;

        A mad scramble to the medicine cabinet ensued shortly after two
gazes fell upon the cute little tush in question.

                        * * * * *

        Kasumi looked at the sliding door in front of her.  All she had to
do was open it and it would be over with.  The faster she got it done with
the sooner she could set about getting her life back in order.  She
decided to make it official today.  She would ask her father to end her
engagement to Ranma.

        No.  She would tell her fianc&eacute;e herself.  It was the right thing to
do and it was really all for the best.  As long as they were still
betrothed, Kasumi would always pine after the girl.  She could see the
conflict that had been slowly evolving between the three of them since
they all had slept with Ranma.  If P-Chan had not come along to keep
Ranma company during the nights, Kasumi really didn&#39;t know how the
situation could have been resolved.

        She could tell that neither Nabiki nor Akane would mind marrying the
boy turned girl as she had thought might happen when the girl first
appeared.  Her assessment had been totally wrong.  Nabiki seemed to have
such a healthy attraction for the opposite sex, even going on a few
dates.  But, Kasumi was not so sure anymore.  Now that she thought about
it, a lot of the names of dates Nabiki spouted out once in awhile could
have been other girls: Haruka, Hikari, etc.

        Akane was the only true surprise.  Kasumi had heard rumors and
gossiping about her sister&#39;s preference, but it never bothered her
because she knew differently.  All one had to do was watch Akane&#39;s face
when she went to Dr. Tofu&#39;s and even the most blind of people could tell
that she was definitely into men.  Kasumi had tried to act as matchmaker
many times on her sister&#39;s behalf, but Dr. Tofu never seemed to be in a
serious mood when she visited him.  She did not mind much though, as her
sister was still young and not in a hurry to be wed.  It was also
heartening to see that the good doctor was young at heart to match
Akane&#39;s physical age.

        As it became increasingly obvious to her that her sisters were both
interested in the engagement, Kasumi knew that something had to be done
before it all blew up in their faces.  They couldn&#39;t all marry Ranma so
something had to give.  She hoped that by stepping out, the situation
would be more manageable.  And if it did get out of line, she could, as
an outsider, help defuse it.

        She looked again at the sliding door.  It would have been easier if
Ranma was some macho jerk of a boy instead of this sweet, caring, kind
girl.  The past two weeks had been utter bliss for Kasumi.  She had
thought that it might have been harder to take care of the household
duties with two more full time occupants living with them.  She had not
accounted for Ranma&#39;s helpful nature, however.  The girl was an absolute
delight.  Sometimes, Kasumi wondered if it really was just habit of
disobeying Uncle Genma&#39;s &#39;manly&#39; teachings that her made her fianc&eacute;e the
way that she was.

        &quot;Oh, hi, Kasumi!&quot; Ranma said cheerfully as she came bounding out of
the dojo.  Her mood was still high from the &#39;help&#39; Akane and Kodachi had
given her in applying the ointment to her bottom.  She hadn&#39;t thought
the bruise was that large, but it looked like she was wrong as the two
of them had rubbed her right buttock all over, spilling over to the
small of the back, the back of the thigh, and even onto the other cheek.

        Just thinking about the experience made her remember why she had
leapt out of the dojo right after they had reluctantly finished with her.  
She needed a cold shower badly.  She needed a shock to her system to make
her forget the two teasing pairs of hands that seemed to almost touch
her _there_, the coldness of the ointment, and the resulting warmth from
minutes after minutes of rubbing.  She imagined her bottom had been as
red as her face was right now.  Fortunately, Kasume didn&#39;t seem to be
paying any attention.  In fact, Kasumi appeared dazed as she stood
outside the dojo doors looking conflicted.  &quot;Kasumi!&quot; Ranma called
again.

        &quot;Ranma!  I didn&#39;t see you there.&quot;  Kasumi nearly jumped when she was
brought out of her deep thought by Ranma.  Kasumi felt guilty as her
resolve at breaking their engagement wavered at the sight of her
fianc&eacute;e&#39;s leotard clad body.

        &quot;Was there something you wanted?&quot; Ranma asked, noticing that Kasumi
was not walking into the dojo.

        &quot;I... I wanted to talk to you about our... ooh, I don&#39;t feel so
well,&quot; Kasumi suddenly said as the queasiness in her stomach seemed to magnify
itself by ten time just by being near Ranma.  Just thinking about not
being Ranma&#39;s fianc&eacute;e anymore brought waves of nausea.

        &quot;Kasumi!&quot;  Ranma rushed forward.  She brought a hand up to the
eldest Tendo sister&#39;s forehead.  It was only slightly warm to the touch,
despite how feverishly red Kasumi&#39;s face was.  Ranma could see she was
even trembling with chills.

        Kasumi tried to say something, but found that she wanted Ranma to
remain this close to her.  The girl&#39;s hand, soft as the finest silk,
glided gently from Kasumi&#39;s forehead to her cheek.  She stared at the
twin buds, very visible underneath the spandex, on her fianc&eacute;e&#39;s chest
becoming more pronounced at the motion of raising a hand to her brow.

        &quot;I think you&#39;re sick, Kasumi,&quot; Ranma pronounced after a moment of
consideration.

        &quot;Wha...?&quot; Kasumi jerked her eyes back up towards Ranma&#39;s face,
expecting to see disgust.

        &quot;I said I think you might have a fever.  You&#39;re shivering, you&#39;re
listless, and your face is all red.  I think you need to get into bed
right now.&quot;

        Kasumi tried to resist as Ranma led her up to her room.  But Ranma&#39;s
grip was quite firm on her arm.  &quot;I&#39;m fine, really.  I think I may just
be a little tired.&quot;

        &quot;All the more reason to get into bed right now,&quot; Ranma replied.
Kasumi was too caring for her own good.  The older girl did not know when to
rest, always making sure everybody was happy, above her own welfare.
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about a thing.  Since it&#39;s the weekend, almost everybody
made plans.  Kodachi and Akane are taking me out ice-skating.  Nabiki is
still out with her friends.  Pop and Mr. Tendo will be happy with the
leftovers from last night.  Pop will be happy as long as there is any
food.&quot;

        &quot;Alright, Ranma,&quot; Kasumi finally relented.  *Do I smile like when
Nabiki or Akane follow my orders?* Kasumi wondered as Ranma smiled as if
she had turned an unruly child around.  Kasumi&#39;s mind boggled at being
treated like a child herself.

        &quot;I think I may know just the thing to give you some relief.  I did
it to Nabiki when I was sleeping with her.&quot;

        &quot;...&quot;

        &quot;A massage, Kasumi,&quot; Ranma clarified as Kasumi seemed to have
frozen. *She looked afraid.  Did she think I did something else to Nabiki?*

        &quot;Oh.&quot;

                        * * * * *

        Akane sat staring at her hands.  She could still feel it throbbing
and tingling in remembrance of the experience of touching Ranma&#39;s plush
bottom.  She resisted the urge to lick her hand clean of the sticky
fluid that was still on it.  She saw her instructor did not have the
same thought.  &quot;Kodachi!&quot;

        &quot;What?  Oh, it&#39;s only ointment, it won&#39;t kill me.  I&#39;ll only get
this ointment on me again if I use my towel to wipe it off.  Our practice is
not finished, remember.&quot;

        &quot;But, you used the towel to wipe of my juice... my _orange juice_
from the whip handle.  And we&#39;ve been rubbing Ranma&#39;s ass...,&quot; Akane stopped
and looked at her hand again.  *How would it taste?* Akane thought
before blushing furiously.  She quickly took her towel from around her
neck and wiped her hand thoroughly with it.

                        * * * * *

        &lt;Thump, thump, thump&gt;

        Ranma glanced at Kasumi.  *Could she hear my heart beating?*  It was
just a simple back rub.  No need to be so excited.  It would just be
like that time she gave one to Nabiki.  No, that wasn&#39;t a good example,
Ranma remembered.  Nabiki had all but asked for her front to be massaged
too.

        *It&#39;s only a massage.  Father and Uncle are just down the stairs.
Akane and Kodachi are still in the house.  Nothing will happen.  Nothing
will happen,* Kasumi repeated the last thought in her mind as she
unzipped her dress from the back.  She looked at the floor, anywhere but
at Ranma, as she shrugged the top half of the dress off her shoulders.
Even though she still had her bra on, she felt self-conscious sitting on
the sleeping mat half-naked waiting for another girl to rub her all
over.

        &quot;Y-you didn&#39;t need to take your clothes off...,&quot; Ranma started to
stammer out, but her eyes remained fixated on Kasumi.  The older girl
sat with her head down, bangs covering what little could be made of her
face.  Her arms half crossed about her middle covering her breasts and
stopping the top half of the dress from falling to her waist.  While she
might have had the idea of modesty, the crossing of her arms had in fact
made her cleavage more noticeable.  The image was at the same time
indecent and innocent.  &quot;...but it will make the massage go smoother
without clothes in the way anyway,&quot; Ranma finished.

        Kasumi nodded, then turned and lay on the mat face down.  She heard
Ranma approach her from behind and soon her fianc&eacute;e&#39;s hands were upon
her back.  They were moist and warm against her skin.  Ranma was
sweating profusely.  *She&#39;s excited by me?* Kasumi wondered.  *No, I
can&#39;t think about that, I need to fix the engagement problem.  Why
haven&#39;t I told her yet?*  Kasumi mulled the question in her mind and
knew that there was only one real answer.  She liked Ranma too much.
Kasumi didn&#39;t know if it was love, but she did know that she felt
positively happy and content right now with Ranma&#39;s hands on her body.

        It wasn&#39;t as if the marriage would take place immediately.  Akane
was only sixteen after all and still had her whole life ahead of her.  At
least until she or Nabiki graduated from university, was Kasumi&#39;s
guess.  That meant at the very least six years and who knew what would
happen in that time.  A pull on the straps to her bra brought her out of
the one sided argument she had with herself.  &quot;Ranma, you can undo the
strap to my bra if it is getting in the way,&quot; Kasumi whispered.  *In the
meantime, I will make Ranma as comfortable as possible,* she decided,
knowing arguing with herself would take her nowhere fast.

        Ranma&#39;s hands trembled at Kasumi&#39;s suggestion.  They shook violently
as Ranma undid the straps that had been the only thing to cover Kasumi&#39;s
smooth back.  It took her a full minute of trying and failing.

        &quot;Ranma, I think you&#39;re sitting too far away.  Maybe if you sat on my
back, you would have better luck.  It would also make it easier on your
arms so that you don&#39;t have to stretch as much,&quot; Kasumi added.  She gave
another small involuntary gasp as the straps moved again.  Ranma&#39;s
fumbling had inadvertently caused Kasumi&#39;s bra to jiggle in such a way
that an intense feeling of pleasure began to build up on her breasts.

        Ranma jerked on the straps unintentionally as Kasumi voiced a
thought that had been in her mind.  She recovered from her shock quickly 
after looking again at her fianc&eacute;e&#39;s lovely back.  As quickly as she could
without appearing to be too eager, she straddled Kasumi&#39;s back with her
legs.

        &quot;Ooh!  You&#39;re so wet and hot,&quot; Kasumi moaned as Ranma sat down.  It
was like there was a furnace on the small of her back.

        &quot;Uh, I got some ointment on my butt.  I guess I should have taken a
bath first,&quot; Ranma replied nervously.  She then proceeded to demonstrate
her skill at bringing relief to Kasumi.

                        * * * * *

        &quot;Ranma!  Where are you?  Almost time to go to the rink!&quot; Akane
called out as she walked down the hallway of the second floor of the house.

        &quot;Right here, Akane,&quot; Ranma said as she staggered out of Kasumi&#39;s
room. The other girl fared no better though, collapsed with exhaustion.

        &quot;Ranma, you still haven&#39;t taken a bath or showered yet?&quot; Akane
asked. She scrunched up her nose at the musky scent still wafting from Ranma&#39;s
body.  The ointment&#39;s smell seemed different.  It was probably wearing
off.

        &quot;Kasumi was feeling a little tired.  So, I helped her to bed.&quot;

        *She&#39;s so sweet,* Akane thought affectionately.  *Too bad I already
took my bath.*  &quot;Kodachi should be nearly finished with her bath, so you
can go in next.  By the way, Ranma, why are you walking so funny.&quot;

        &quot;...Cramp,&quot; came the slow reply.

                        * * * * *

        &quot;Hurry up!  We&#39;re going to miss everything,&quot; Ranma called as she
sprinted farther in front of their small group.

        &quot;Well, if you cleaned up and changed earlier we would be there by
now,&quot; Akane said in a mock scolding tone.  She smiled at Ranma&#39;s impatience.
It reminded her of her first time at the rink.

        &quot;You&#39;ve never skated before, Ranma?&quot; Kodachi asked, also smiling at
the childish antics of her friend.

        &quot;No, I could never afford skates when I was on the road with Pop and
even if I could, I had no place to carry them with me.  I just can&#39;t
wait to try though.  Akane and the girls at school talk about it so
much.&quot;

        &quot;Yuka and Sayuri should be there by now.  We&#39;re going to meet them
at a place that sells ramen not far from there for dinner first.  We better
hurry, we should be there by now,&quot; Akane said and sprinted to catch up
to Ranma who was running backwards and looking back at them just a ways
in front.

        Kodachi ran a little slower.  She had grown used to the Tendo
sisters and Ranma, but she still wasn&#39;t comfortable around other girls.  All 
the girls at the catholic school she went to were of upper class families.
Kodachi&#39;s reputation in gymnastics and her family station gave her the
respect of her classmates.  However, her reputation as hard trainer and
rumored poor sportsmanlike conduct *Hah!* also made her feared, so much
that not many of her classmates did much more than chat with her.  She
saw Ranma and Akane slow down to wait for her, causing her to smile.
She inwardly blanched at the thought of losing them.

        &quot;I&#39;m still your friend, remember, even if you don&#39;t have a good time
with the others.  Just relax,&quot; Ranma whispered into Kodachi&#39;s ear when
she caught up to them.  Ranma smiled back at the girl&#39;s startled face.
She had guessed right when she had seen her friend pale at Yuka and
Sayuri&#39;s names.  During Akane&#39;s match with Kodachi a week ago, Ranma
could not help but notice that when she went to congratulate the
gymnast&#39;s victory, no one from Kodachi&#39;s school had done the same.
Other than some scattered applause, Kodachi did not nearly have the same
support Akane had from her fellow classmates, all clamoring to tell her
that she did a good job despite the loss.

        &quot;Ranma,&quot; Kodachi whispered back, her voice thick with emotion.  It
was at times like these she wondered if she what she felt for Ranma was mere
friendship.  &quot;I think I l...&quot;

        &quot;P-Chan!&quot; Ranma cried out as she spotted at black piglet roaming
about the street in front of her, not noticing Kodachi falling flat on her
face.

        Akane growled to herself as she went to help Kodachi to her feet.
Akane had thought she had gotten rid of Ryoga when she made sure that
Ranma&#39;s door was left open when the went to school the other day.
Knowing Ryoga&#39;s directional problem, she had expected him to be gone for
a month rather than a couple of days.

        &quot;Akane, you&#39;re holding my arm a bit hard,&quot; Kodachi winced.  Nice
girl, Akane was, but didn&#39;t know her own strength.  She took a look at the 
pig that had ruined her moment with Ranma crossly.  &quot;P-Chan?  Oh, that
piglet you were carrying when I visited you a couple of weeks ago.&quot;

        &quot;Yep!  He&#39;s my pet pig.  I found him just a day before I met you.
Isn&#39;t he the cutest little thing you ever saw in you life?&quot;

        *No, you are,* Kodachi thought as she was the sunny smile on her
friend&#39;s face.  Her eyes went wide at the errant thought.  She shook her
head to get rid of it, wondering again where it came from, however true
it was.  The look of pure joy on Ranma did indeed make everything else
around her pale in comparison.  The anger she felt at the pig ebbed the
longer she stood there watching pet and owner.  Kodachi could not find
the anger for the pig that obviously made Ranma so happy... &quot;Ow!  The
little demon bit me!&quot;

        Ryoga reluctantly let go of the hand that had come close to petting
him as he heard Ranma&#39;s scolding voice.  He let his discontent with the girl
be known by continuing to growl at her.  She was another one of _them_.
It was increasingly hard, he found to persuade Ranma back to being a boy
again.  As long as these witches kept up with their tricks and their
fake smiles, Ryoga despaired at ever regaining the friend he had once
known.

        &quot;Sorry about that Kodachi.  P-Chan&#39;s a little shy around most
people. He doesn&#39;t even like Kasumi,&quot; Ranma said hoping that Kodachi didn&#39;t 
take it the wrong way.  *It is strange in that the only person P-Chan likes
is me,* Ranma thought as he looked at the contrite looking pig.  *I
guess he must have not been well taken care of by whoever owned him
before.*

        P-Chan &#39;suffered&#39; under Ranma&#39;s ministrations, finding it harder to
keep on pouting.  He finally decided to show Ranma there was no hard
feelings by scrambling and taking a seat on Ranma&#39;s head.  A seat that
was becoming more and more customary for him the longer he stayed at the
Tendo&#39;s house.

        Kodachi waved off Ranma&#39;s apology.  It made her feel like the &#39;bad
guy&#39; as Ranma looked to be torn between comforting her pet and apologizing.
&quot;It is not to be helped, Ranma.  It looks to be a wild pig you have
there.  Quite the runt by the look of it.  Probably never been
domesticated.&quot;

        Akane had a hard time trying to contain her laughter as she watched
Ryoga&#39;s black skin take on an ugly purple tone.  If a piglet could ever
look indignant, it was Ryoga.  &quot;Now, now, Kodachi.  We must be fair to
it.  I mean, Ranma only took a week to potty train it.&quot;  She might not
tell about the secret or hit him in his weakened state, but that did not
mean she condoned the boy&#39;s indecent actions.

        A vein protruded from Ryoga&#39;s small head.  He did not ever do that
at the dojo!  &quot;Bwee!&quot;

        &quot;Oh dear.  P-Chan&#39;s getting restless.  We better get going.  I think
he might be hungry from being on the road so long,&quot; Ranma said, concerned
at the way P-Chan was hissing and snarling.

        Ryoga quieted down as Ranma placated him and fumed in silence.
First thing he did when he got to where ever Ranma was taking him was to get
some hot water.

                        * * * * *

        Kodachi laughed.  She blinked.  She laughed again.  No sick feeling
as she felt she might have had two weeks ago before she met Ranma.  She was
feeling quite good as a matter of fact.  There was also something
strange about her laughter.  Ah, that was it.  She did not sound like
the &#39;lunatic&#39; her other laugh had given her the reputation of.

        &quot;Very funny,&quot; Yuka grimaced as she tried to get up again off the
ice. She fell down again a second later.  She soon found herself enjoying a
laugh with Sayuri and Kodachi at her own expense.  &quot;I just can&#39;t skate.&quot;

        &quot;I wouldn&#39;t say that.  You have a lot of potential,&quot; Kodachi said
truthfully as the other girl finally got up and managed to stay up this
time.

        &quot;Unlike some people,&quot; Sayuri agreed.

        Yuka and Kodachi bigsweated as Ranma slid past them flat on her
face.

        Akane ducked her head sheepishly in acknowledgment to her friends as
she raced passed them towards Ranma.  Akane had only let go of the girl
for a moment, but that was long enough for her to fall again.
&quot;Honestly, Ranma.  For someone with your coordination and skill, you&#39;d
think you&#39;d have an easier time with this.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ve always had some problems with balance practice.  The first
time I practiced moving over a ground covered in oil, I must have fallen a
hundred times.  But, I did master it in about a week along with any
other exercises my pop put me through,&quot; Ranma said confidently as she
pulled herself up using the rink boards.  She considered letting go and
having another try at it before her wobbling knees convinced her that it
was safer holding onto the board.

        &quot;Ranma, remember this is supposed to be fun.  Stop thinking of it as
a &#39;practice session&#39;,&quot; Akane admonished.  There were some things that were
just too ingrained in Ranma&#39;s mind by Uncle, Akane had discovered
recently.  Even Kodachi had been ready to scold the girl&#39;s seriousness
during their gymnastics sessions.  Ranma took the training even more
seriously than the gymnast did, if that was possible.  It was hard to
believe that Ranma had fun when a scowl crossed her face whenever she
failed to learn a technique or to skate properly as they were doing now.

        &quot;Ah, sorry, Akane,&quot; Ranma apologized.  She couldn&#39;t help it though.
It seemed to her sometimes that her entire life had been one long training
session.  Swimming, playing tag, shooting marbles, and nearly anything
else that could have been associated with childhood pasttimes had all
been subverted by her pop into training for some sort of technique.  She
recalled it being another one of the reasons that had turned her
childish mind away from her pop&#39;s ideal boy.  If she were a girl she
would have been able to have fun instead of working all the time.

        Akane&#39;s stern demeanor dropped at Ranma&#39;s drooping head.  &quot;Don&#39;t
worry about it.  You can&#39;t be expected to change how you think and feel in
just a couple of weeks.  These things take time.&quot;  Akane wondered how
much of what she had said applied to Ranma and how much to herself.  It
had only taken her a few days to get used to the word &#39;fianc&eacute;e&#39; so that
she didn&#39;t wince after hearing it.  Two weeks later and she found
herself holding on to the word possessively, remembering her talk with
Kodachi back at the dojo while they practiced.

                        * * * * *

        &quot;So what do you think of my idea?&quot; Kodachi asked again while she
nonchalantly flung another razor sharp hoop in Akane&#39;s direction.

        &quot;I don&#39;t know.  What we&#39;re doing so far is working.  Why mess with a
good thing?&quot; Akane asked in reply.  She jumped over the hoop and knew
from a previous gash on her leg that it would rebound off the wall back
at her.  Better prepared this time she jumped again and sent a volley of
bowling pins towards the direction Kodachi would be forced to jump to
avoid the hoop herself.

        Kodachi smiled at Akane&#39;s clever tactic as the first of the pins hit
her on the arm.  She grabbed one out of the air and blocked the
remaining pins with it.  Landing on her feet she paced warily across the
room, picking up her ribbon that lay on the ground cautiously in the
meantime.  &quot;Your father strikes me as the over anxious type.  Are you
sure he would be willing to wait until you graduate before making Ranma
decide on one of you?  These are men that engaged two girls together
remember just because neither has a boy of their own.  They can&#39;t be all
that right in the mind.&quot;

        Akane was surprised that the gymnast&#39;s flimsy ribbon held its own
against her whip.  She was even more surprised when it was suddenly
ripped out of her hand when the two weapons became tangled up with each
other.  While she was stronger than Kodachi, the girl&#39;s greater skill
became clearer in that instant.  Without a weapon, she resorted to
taking off her gi&#39;s belt as improvisation.  Unarmed combat was
disallowed for this session as they had agreed earlier.

        Kodachi pressed her advantage over Akane in the battle and in the
conversation.  &quot;I say we find some patsy and tell the two old fools that
he took Ranma&#39;s virtue.  From what I&#39;ve heard of Ran, he sounds like the
perfect person to blame.  He&#39;s as good a fighter as Ranma and is missing
more times than not so he could hold his own against your fathers&#39; anger
and won&#39;t be around to get in the way of Ranma&#39;s daily life.  That might
also divert my brother&#39;s attention.&quot;  Kodachi&#39;s eyebrow twitched when
she had realized the ponytailed girl her brother had been going on about
was her very own Ranma.  She was just glad that her friend did not think
badly of her because her brother&#39;s antics.

        Akane flicked the offending ribbon away with short snaps of her
belt. Her guilt over keeping Ranma&#39;s secret boy form had nearly cost her 
the match.  She forced it down to focus on the match.  While Kodachi was
faster with her ribbon, the length of it delayed that speed enough that
her cloth belt could handle it.  Another flick of her wrist formed a rod
out of the belt as Ryoga had taught her.  She whipped it over to the
surprised Kodachi&#39;s arm, hoping to disable her weapon.  &quot;I still don&#39;t
know about that.  I don&#39;t think your brother is the type that backs down
easily.  And what if Uncle still decides to marry Ranma off to us?  I
mean one of us will have to provide an heir.  They might like the idea
of Ran being a surrogate father.&quot;  Akane ignored the burning feeling in
her tongue after telling such a horrendous lie.

        Kodachi&#39;s mind clouded with anger at the situation that Akane
proposed might happen.  Kodachi didn&#39;t even feel the cloth belt slam against 
her arm as she fumed.  The two idiots Akane and Ranma had for fathers might
just be dumb enough to do that.

        Akane grunted as the ribbon snapping at her became more forceful.
The tactic she had used only seemed to make Kodachi more intense.  &quot;You
win,&quot; Akane regretfully acknowledged.  The two of them broke away and
bowed to each other signaling the end of this round.

        &quot;Why are you so concerned about this anyway?  You&#39;re not interested
in Ranma yourself are you?  Ranma has told you of her preference, right?&quot;
Akane asked suspiciously.

        &quot;O-of course, I&#39;m not interested in Ranma!  I&#39;m not _that_ way,&quot;
Kodachi protested loudly as if there was an audience present.  Her late
mother had drilled it into her mind that real ladies didn&#39;t feel like
that.

        Besides that, the truth was that Ranma hadn&#39;t told Kodachi.
However, it did explain the looks Ranma gave her the night they spent atop 
the dojo&#39;s roof.  &quot;Would I want to push Ranma onto Ran if I were?  I just
don&#39;t like seeing my new friends in an uncompromising relationship such
as this.  I can&#39;t imagine that this does your social life any good with
this engagement known throughout the school.  That is unless _you_ want
Ranma in that way.  Your sister seems to be the type...&quot;

        &quot;Um, I&#39;m not that way either,&quot; Akane mumbled softly looking at her
shuffling feet, but her voice still audible to Kodachi&#39;s ear.  An
uncomfortable silence fell between the two of them, both not sure what
to say.  Akane looked up and noticed the other girl&#39;s eyes were had a
glazed look about them, and she suddenly became aware of her open gi.
Without the belt, the flaps of the cloth fell way to reveal her sports
bra and whole lot of skin.  Self-consciously, she pulled her shirt
together and went to look for her belt, leaving Kodachi still standing
there lost in thought.

        Kodachi&#39;s mind snapped out of her stupor as the object of her gaze
was removed from her line of sight.  Just remembering about Nabiki and their
handshake brought a shiver down her spine.  No!  Kuno Kodachi, her
mother&#39;s daughter in every way, could _not_ be that way!

        &quot;Ah, let&#39;s start on unarmed combat now,&quot; Akane said, while she tied
her belt back on, making sure it was extra tight.

                        * * * * *

        &quot;P-Chan!  I lost P-Chan!&quot;

        Ranma&#39;s cry broke Akane out of her reverie.  &quot;More like he got lost.
The pig couldn&#39;t find his way out of a paper bag.  He&#39;ll be back
tomorrow or next week at the latest.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s my fault for not paying attention.  Where could he be?&quot;

        Kodachi skated over with Sayuri, the both of them dragging Yuka
along,
at the sudden commotion.  &quot;Is there a problem?&quot; Kodachi asked.

        &quot;P-Chan&#39;s gone!&quot; Ranma cried again.

        *Good riddance,* Kodachi thought but did not voice.  Still, she did
not like seeing Ranma upset.  &quot;He can&#39;t have gotten far if what you tell me
of his sense of direction is true.&quot;

        &quot;Er, isn&#39;t that P-Chan right there?&quot; Yuka asked, pointing to a
piglet that indeed looked like the missing pet that was in the arms of another
girl.

        &quot;P-Chan!&quot;  Ranma happily skated to her piglet, before realising she
hadn&#39;t yet mastered the art.

        Azusa looked up to see a terrified girl wailing and flailing about
barreling down upon her at the speed of a freight train.  The next thing
she knew she was laid flat on her back with the girl on top of her.

        Ranma supported her weight with her hands before she could land
heavily on the other girl.  From the look of it, the girl was almost as short 
as she was and much thinner looking, giving a look of frailty.  Ranma
wondered how it was that she got into these compromising positions.
&quot;Uh, sorry.  I&#39;m still not very good.&quot;

        &quot;You should be sorry!&quot; Azusa huffed.  She hated it when newbies
crowded the rink.  If they couldn&#39;t skate, they should not touch the ice.  
&quot;And can you get off of me?&quot;

        &quot;Sorry, again,&quot; Ranma winced at the angry tone the girl&#39;s voice took
on.  She quickly got off of the girl, giving only a soft groan as she
pushed off the ice.  Her hands had landed awkward and were red having
been rubbed raw from skidding on the surface for about a meter.

        Azusa&#39;s anger faltered at the sight of the girl&#39;s hands.  It had to
hurt like hell.  *This girl had purposely hurt herself to help me?*
&quot;Just make sure you don&#39;t do it again.  You scared my poor little
Charlotte.&quot;

        &quot;Charlotte!?&quot; Ranma asked at Azusa&#39;s claim.  &quot;You mean he&#39;s yours?
I... I didn&#39;t know.  I found him two weeks ago, escaping from the rain.&quot;

        &quot;Yes, he&#39;s mine.  Aren&#39;t you, my widdle Charwotte.  Your mommy&#39;s
special widdle piggy,&quot; she gushed, forgetting her ire at the non-skater.

        Akane and the rest of the others soon joined the two girls and she
caught some of the conversation.  *That girl&#39;s lying.  No way, Ryoga was
owned by her,* Akane thought.  She briefly considered letting this slide
and let Ryoga deal with it, but it was just something she couldn&#39;t do.
He was helpless as a pig and it wouldn&#39;t be fair.  &quot;Ranma, I don&#39;t think
she&#39;s telling the truth.  Charlotte is a female name.  P-Chan is a boy.&quot;

        Ranma found it hard to accept Akane&#39;s claim no matter how much she
wanted to.  The concept of a girl being dishonest was foreign to her.
She had always viewed the female side of the species to be the most
truthful and kind.  The way this skater had held and protected P-Chan
with her body when they collided suggested to Ranma that the girl cared
for the pet.  Also, only an owner would revert to such mind numbing
cuteness for a piglet.

        &quot;I&#39;m afraid this lovely girl is telling the truth.  My partner here
is in the habit of pilfering items that attract her interest,&quot; a boy said,
skating up to P-Chan and taking him out of one pair of hands and placing
them into Ranma&#39;s.

        &quot;I thought I recognized her.  That&#39;s Sanzenin Mikado, so that must
Shiratori Azusa, together they make the Golden Pair,&quot; Sayuri said after
seeing Mikado&#39;s face.

        Ranma could not believe her ears.  Girls did not steal.  They were
supposed to be better than her pop&#39;s ideal manly man.  She plucked her
piglet from Mikado&#39;s hands without even bothering to thank the lying boy
and somehow managed to walk over without falling to Azusa.  &quot;Charlotte
seems like a perfectly good name for a pig.  I&#39;m sorry that this pig
isn&#39;t yours.  Maybe I could help you find yours with you.  I can let you
hold onto P-Chan while we search if you would like.&quot;

        For the first time in her life, Azusa hesitated.  Never had anyone
acted this way when she &#39;took&#39; what she felt was hers back.  Her resolve
stalled for only a moment however as she looked at the cute piglet being
offered to her.  &quot;Charlotte is mine!  Isn&#39;t that right my widdle
Charwotte?&quot; she asked the piglet as she took him back from the girl&#39;s
hands.  &quot;I challenge you to a skating contest for Charlotte!&quot;

        &quot;I... uh,&quot; Ranma stared at her now empty hands.  She was at a loss
for how to deal with Azusa&#39;s challenge and false claim.  Fortunately,
further thinking on this subject was cut off by the sound of a sudden
cry.  She looked over to the source of the disturbance and saw that it
was Azusa.  Her partner Mikado had once again taken P-Chan away from her
and handed him to Akane.  Strangely, Ranma felt no gratitude from this
gesture of the boy&#39;s.  Her eyes were concentrated on Azusa&#39;s tear filled
face.

        &quot;Cut that out!&quot; Mikado yelled at his partner when she refused to
leave him alone about the stupid piglet.  Azusa glared at him for a long
moment before her short attention span wavered and she left chasing
after someone dressed in a panda suit.  He then turned his attention to
the owner of the said animal and smiled.  That girl was a cute one,
along with her companions.  Two more and he would reach that one
thousand kiss mark.  Any of these fine young ladies would be worthy of
it he was certain.  &quot;I assure you miss that the fault lies entirely with
my partner.  Now that we have this misunderstanding settled.  Don&#39;t you
think I deserve a reward for my trouble?&quot;

        Ranma was so lost in thinking about Azusa&#39;s tears, she did not
notice Mikado&#39;s lips zeroing in on her until it was too late.  She managed 
to twist her head to the side at the last moment, but his disgustingly
slimy touch still managed to fall upon her cheek.  &quot;Waah!&quot;

        *Damn!* Mikado thought as he missed, but before he could try again
the girl was out of his arms and running towards the men&#39;s room.  &quot;To weep
from such a chaste kiss as that, your friend is shy indeed.&quot;

        Akane stared at the fleeing form of her fianc&eacute;e.  *Ranma.*  Her
thoughts occupied, she didn&#39;t noticed a certain piglet leaving her arms
and running after Ranma.

        &quot;How dare you!?&quot; Kodachi yelled out in indignation.  In an instant
her skirt and blouse came off, revealing a black leotard underneath, and in
her hands, a black rose.  &quot;Stealing the kiss of innocent young ladies is
unforgivable.  In the name of the rose, I will punish you.&quot;

        A breeze swept through the area as fifty people, everyone on the
ice, facefaulted.

        Akane was the first to recover.  She skated to Kodachi&#39;s side and
fought the urge to make a similar pose.  &quot;What kind of sick pervert goes
around kissing people without permission?&quot;

        Mikado was perplexed as he squared off against the two girls.  This
was not the normal reaction he received from girls.  They usually clamored
to have him kiss them.  He found the idea of these two resisting his
charm irresistible.  What better way to get his thousandth kiss than by
subverting a girl&#39;s hatred for him into love?

        &quot;Sanzenin!&quot;

        Akane and Kodachi&#39;s attention on Mikado was cut short by the
entrance of a very irate boy.  Irate, however, was a gross understatement.  
The boy&#39;s gaze could bore a hole into titanium.  Mikado didn&#39;t even give
notice to the newcomer&#39;s entrance as he had taken on jealous boyfriends
many times before.

        *For what he did to me, a beating from my girl form is just not
enough!* Ranma thought to himself.  &quot;I can not forgive what you did to
m... Ranma!  The humiliation you inflicted upon her, I shall repay a
hundred fold!&quot;

        &quot;I was right.  Ran is interested in Ranma,&quot; Kodachi said to Akane.
&quot;Only someone as innocent as Ranma could believe that Ran&#39;s shadowing
and similar style of dress is means nothing.&quot;

        Akane gave her friend as sharp glance, *Did I hear a tone of
jealousy.*  She waved it off.  Like Kodachi has said before, if she were
interested, she wouldn&#39;t be pushing Ranma on to another.

        &quot;I suggest you guys tell everyone to leave the rink.&quot;

        Akane was startled at Ryoga&#39;s appearance.  He had somehow found some
hot water and some clothes.  &quot;What?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ve only seen Ranma this mad once.  One time when he took me home,
we happened to see a group of boys bothering a couple of girls.  One of the
girl&#39;s fell down and scraped her knee.  The boys all ended up in
traction for two weeks.&quot;

        Akane felt a chill at Ryoga&#39;s deadly serious voice.  &quot;We better
listen to what he says.  Ryoga knows Ranm... knows Ran better than us.  
He&#39;s a childhood friend of Ran and Ranma, always mixing the two of them up,&quot;
Akane explained to Kodachi when the other girl gave her a questioning
look.  She hoped that Ryoga caught her emphasis on the two names Ran and
Ranma.  The boy might not be the brightest one on the block, but he was
sensitive enough to know Ranma&#39;s identity was to be a secret.

                        * * * * *

        &quot;Only five hundred and eighteen punches?&quot; Kodachi sniffed with
disdain as if she could have thrown more.  While she had wanted to help her
friend by using Ran&#39;s interest in Ranma, she was also unreasonably angry
at Ran for being interested in the first place.  Her mind held a strange
mixture of ideas for matching the two of them up and splitting them
apart.

        &quot;I would have hit him more but by then I was knocked out of the spin
of death Mikado had me in,&quot; Ranma replied moodily.

        &quot;You did all you could, Ran,&quot; Ryoga said, showing his support by
giving his friend a pat on the back, a ghost of a smile on his face.  It had 
been a long while since they were able to walk side by side like this,
just talking.  No curses, idiot fathers, or perverted girls, just two
men sharing some brotherly bonding.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll win the skating
match for P-erk-Chan.&quot;

        &quot;So, you&#39;ll help m... Ranma out?&quot; Ranma asked, glancing at Kodachi
hoping that the gymnast didn&#39;t catch his slip of the tongue.

        &quot;Hey, you&#39;ve helped me plenty of times back then.  Besides, it&#39;ll
give me a chance to regain my old champion skating form.&quot;

        Akane rolled her eyes.  When Ryoga had burst on to the scene to warn
them of Ranma&#39;s anger, he had fallen a dozen time just trying to get off
the ice and he hadn&#39;t even been wearing skates.  &quot;Ran, what&#39;s wrong with
me and you partnering up?  Ranma isn&#39;t all that great on skates.&quot;

        Before Ryoga could retort, Kodachi stepped in.  &quot;This is all right
and all the be discussing our strategy against the golden pair, but don&#39;t
you think we should head back to the dojo and see if Ranma is there
first?&quot; Kodachi asked, annoyed.

        &quot;I&#39;ve got to run,&quot; Ranma quickly said.  He needed to get home and
change back into a girl before their group reached home.  His thoughts
grew darker as he ran home alone, images of Azusa and Mikado haunting
him every step of the way.

                        * * * * *

        &quot;So, what do you think we should do?&quot; Kodachi asked Akane and Kasumi
as they looked in on the brooding figure, huddled up in the dojo.  Kodachi
was not exactly experienced in situations dealing with boys and
kissing.  From Akane, she now knew her friend&#39;s preference was not the
male half of the species.  This little fact was playing havoc with her
mind as she wondered why Ranma wanted to be friends with her as she had
wondered ever since they met.

        Akane shoulders slumped.  She had hoped Kodachi might be able to
help. Akane might have tried to help but the with Kodachi and Kasumi looking
on, she lost her nerve as there was no telling what Ranma might do in
this vulnerable state.  She might have accepted having a girl for a
fianc&eacute;e, but to be seen in an intimate position was another story.
Ryoga was no help either, going white in the face at even the suggestion
of a boy, boy kiss.  However, he was smart enough to change into a pig
and offer comfort that way.  Too bad the jerk still hadn&#39;t appeared
after leaving for the bathroom an hour ago.

        &quot;You don&#39;t suppose it was his first do you?&quot; Kasumi asked from where
she sat, also looking in on Ranma.  The girls had told her of what
happened at the rink and from the dark look in Ranma&#39;s eyes, she knew it
was serious.  For all her knowledge of what it is like to be a teenaged
girl, she was embarrassed to admit she didn&#39;t know how to react to a
kiss.

        Akane blushed as she recalled the time she shared Ranma&#39;s bed.  The
girl had muttered various names in her sleep and they had all sounded
like girl names to Akane.  &quot;No, I think Ranma has kissed a girl before.
She seems to be comfortable around us.&quot;

        &quot;Oh, I knew that,&quot; Kasami said, not noticing Akane and Kodachi
narrowing their eyes at her admission.  &quot;I meant a boy.  First time a
boy kissed her,&quot; Kasumi explained.

        &quot;Of course it was,&quot; Nabiki said as she walked up on the trio of
peeping toms.  &quot;I know what happened.  I was at the rink, hanging out also.  
I saw the whole thing.  Now, if you three will stop ogling at my fianc&eacute;e,
maybe I can help the girl.&quot;  She laughed inwardly at the sputtering
indignation she received from Akane and Kodachi.  Kasumi gave her a
disapproving look but moved out of the way to let her into the dojo.

                        * * * * *

        Nabiki sighed with exasperation after it looked like Ranma wasn&#39;t
about to respond to her any time soon.  &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you liked it?  Oh, my
poor aching heart.  My fianc&eacute;e has subverted on me.&quot;

        &quot;I have not!&quot; Ranma replied, before realizing she had been baited.
&quot;Leave me alone.  And you can tell that to the rest of them looking in
on us.&quot;

        &quot;They&#39;re just worried about you, Ranma.  C&#39;mon, it was just a kiss
on the cheek.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s not that,&quot; Ranma finally said when she realized that Nabiki
was not going to leave her alone.  &quot;It&#39;s what happened today with the golden
pair.&quot;

        &quot;That crazy klepto that tried to claim P-Chan?  Not what I would
call a good... ah!&quot;  It clicked in Nabiki&#39;s mind what Ranma was talking about.
&quot;I think I understand.  She&#39;s a girl, but she doesn&#39;t fit the bill of
what you laughingly call the fairer sex?&quot;

        Nabiki noticed Ranma look up with fire in her eyes.  *That got her
attention.*  &quot;Yes, I did mean laughingly.  Girls aren&#39;t perfect you
know.  We have as much faults as boys do.&quot;  Nabiki stopped talking as
Ranma stopped listening by covering her ears with her hands.  She rolled
her eyes and waited for Ranma to budge again.

        Ranma was beginning to understand his three fianc&eacute;es and friend were
all just as stubborn as she was when they all stayed in their relative
positions for another half-hour.  She finally let go of her ears only to
hear Nabiki&#39;s lecture resume as if they had only taken a small break.

        &quot;Tell me was that the reason you became a girl?  You thought we were
better than men?&quot; Nabiki asked, needling Ranma again with words the girl
probably did not want to hear.

        Knowing that Nabiki and the others outside were just going to wait
for her to answer anyway, Ranma gave in and looked back up to Nabiki.
&quot;Maybe at first, yeah, I did.  Lately, being around you and Kodachi made
me realize that my reasons have changed.  I&#39;m not that stupid you know.
I know that you are selling pictures of me at school and that Kodachi is
not always fair when she fights.&quot;

        Nabiki shrugged and chuckled when she heard a not so delicate cough
outside the dojo.  Trusting a school filled with boys to keep a secret
was foolish so she expected her fianc&eacute;e to find out her vices sooner or
later, but the admission to knowing how Kodachi acted was news to
Nabiki.  Ranma displayed an impressive sense of denial when it came to
the gymnast, always phrasing Kodachi&#39;s actions in the best possible
light.

        &quot;I&#39;m not angry at either of you.  Some of the girls have shown me
some of the pictures you&#39;ve sold before, I&#39;m just glad I&#39;m clothed in them.
Kodachi, I have even less reason to be mad at.  I&#39;m far worse than she
is.&quot;

        Nabiki looked sharply at Ranma.  That was it!  &quot;It&#39;s you.  You&#39;re
the one that&#39;s not matching your ideal image of a girl.&quot;

        &quot;Yeah.  I&#39;ve told you before I didn&#39;t know how to describe the
feeling, just that I&#39;m comfortable in this form.  Yet, today, I changed back 
to my male form and had fun beating up on Mikado,&quot; Ranma admitted
miserably.

        &quot;Is that all?&quot; Nabiki giggled as Ranma again looked up with her eyes
smoldering.  &quot;Yes, it is silly.  You&#39;re doubting your femininity because
you enjoyed your moment of manliness.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s not funny,&quot; Ranma pouted firmly.

        &quot;Ranma, Ranma, Ranma.  Are you saying my sister is a man then?  My
sister loves to fight and from what I&#39;ve seen, so does Kodachi.  Tell
me, would you have had as much fun beating Mikado up as a girl?&quot;

        &quot;No, well, maybe.  But my guy form is stronger so it would hurt him
more.  I enjoyed _that_,&quot; Ranma pointed out, however her feelings of
self pity were fast leaving her as her fianc&eacute;e shot down her reasons one
by one.

        &quot;A tool,&quot; Nabiki waved off Ranma&#39;s point, &quot;just like Akane would
prefer a mallet to a pillow.  If you ever doubt your femininity again, I&#39;m 
the one that&#39;s going to get violent.  The three of them out there and you
are all twice more feminine than I am.  No, don&#39;t try to deny it.  Name
one thing that I do that is feminine.&quot;

        &quot;Uh,&quot; Ranma faltered as Nabiki stared intently at her.  It was true.
She had never once seen Nabiki perform any of the traditional female
chores of cooking and mending that Kasumi, Akane, as bad at it as she
was, and Kodachi have.  But that was not really a standard to go by
anymore.  She smiled inwardly as she figured out her answer and she
leaned forward to whisper it into Nabiki&#39;s ear.

        Nabiki felt a faint blush come to her cheeks as the other girl&#39;s
whispers brushed against her ear.  &quot;Ranma, my sisters are outside...,&quot;
Nabiki&#39;s voice trailed off as Ranma&#39;s hot breath traveled along the side
of her neck as she continued to talk in that naughtily sounding voice.

                        * * * * *

        &quot;They do know that we&#39;re out here, don&#39;t they?&quot; Kodachi asked,
shocked at Nabiki&#39;s behavior.  The middle Tendo was not what Kodachi&#39;s 
mother would have called a decent young lady.  The late Kuno matriarch 
would also have said that her daughter&#39;s thoughts were quite indecent 
however.

        &quot;Nabiki&#39;s bolder than before,&quot; Akane added as they watched
voyeuristically at the unfolding scene.

        &quot;She was undecided before.  She&#39;s a practical girl.  When she
decides on something she will do everything in her power to make it happen.&quot;
Kasumi decided it was time to announce dinner.  It would mean that she
would have to go inside and break the two up, but they must be hungry
after a day of skating while all Kasumi did was sleep the afternoon
away.

                        * * * * *

        &quot;I have to put my hands where!?&quot; Ranma asked incredulously.  She was
wondering if their decision to go as two girls to the upcoming match was
a good idea.  They had decided Ryoga&#39;s direction sense was too
unreliable and since it was not a real competition, only a match for
P-Chan, they could throw some of the rules out the door.

        &quot;Right there,&quot; Nabiki pointed again glumly.  *What I wouldn&#39;t give
to be a martial artist right now.*

        Ranma looked up at the valley above and gulped.  Akane hung on a
rope right above, wearing a very tight figure skating outfit with her legs
spread out.  Tentatively, Ranma reached up and grabbed hold of Akane&#39;s
ankles.

        &quot;Higher, Ranma.  Much, much higher,&quot; Nabiki frowned as she looked at
the book in her hand.

        Akane tried looking down from her position but could not see
anything other than Ranma&#39;s head.  It was frustrating her, not knowing was 
going on below her.  She bit her lip to keep from screaming as Ranma&#39;s fingers
traveled higher up her legs along her inner thighs not stopping until
they were an inch away from an itch she had suddenly developed and
desperately needed to scratch.

        &quot;Ranma, are you sure I can&#39;t be your partner?&quot; Kodachi asked again,
looking up at Akane enviously.  She was envious only because Akane would
get to beat up that Mikado jerk of course.  Kodachi couldn&#39;t even take
her anger out on the Golden Pair as Ranma had asked her specifically not
to be &#39;enthusiastic&#39; in greeting them before the match.

        &quot;Ranma, you&#39;re going to have to grab her harder than that.  Akane is
a better fighter without weapons, Kodachi.  Beside, we already said you
can be an alternate.&quot; Nabiki bit out.  She was not in a happy mood.
First Akane breaks her big chances with Ranma, then Kasumi, and now she
had to sit through and watch this.

        Akane felt the taste of blood in her mouth as she clamped down with
her teeth harder when Ranma&#39;s hands became more forceful.  She nearly
fainted when it was Kodachi&#39;s turn to practice on her.  Somehow she
managed to stay conscious.  After all, Kodachi and Ranma would be the
next two up here and Akane would be down there.

                        * * * * *

        &quot;P-Chan!&quot; Ranma called out when she noticed a trophy being brought
out had a certain little piglet attached to it.

        *So, that&#39;s where he&#39;s been the past week,* Akane thought.  *We&#39;ll
get you out of there, Ryoga.  You might be a jerk, but you are a human
being.*

        Azusa and Mikado skated out next.  *She&#39;s looking even more lovely
than before,* Mikado thought as he looked at Ranma.  Make-up and a skimpy
outfit were very flattering.  He turned shook his head when the judge
asked him if he had a problem with two girls taking the challenge.  Why
would he have a problem?  *Numbers nine hundred ninety-nine and one
thousand, here I come.*

        Azusa watched the girl Ranma suspiciously as she approached before
the match began.  &quot;What do you want?&quot;

        &quot;You can still change your mind,&quot; Ranma said, pleading her case one
last time.  While she had accepted girls were not perfect angels that
did not mean she could stand hating her very first girl.  It didn&#39;t sit
well with her at all.  &quot;I can see P-Chan looks healthy and I know he&#39;s a
healthy eater, so you much have taken good care of him.  You can visit
P-Chan any time if you would just give up on this.&quot;

        Azusa watched as Ranma handed her a key chain in the shape of a
black piglet.  Her determination faltered again for a moment as she took 
the cute little key chain.  It was so much easier to take things when her
opponent hated her.  &quot;No, Charlotte is mine,&quot; she finally said before
handing the key chain back and turning away signaling their conversation
was over.  Ranma was just being friendly because she wanted Charlotte
and no other reason.  The girl would stop being nice once she got the
piglet back.  *Better to keep the piglet&#39;s love,* Azusa decided.

                        * * * * *

        Kodachi fumed as she sat with Nabiki and Kasumi on the bench.
&quot;Ranma hasn&#39;t had enough practice.  I should be in there with her.&quot;  She was
_not_ jealous at hearing Ranma pronounce to everyone in the arena that
Akane was her fianc&eacute;e.

        &quot;Kodachi, Ranma had a reason for taking the match.  Did you see what
she did before the match with Azusa?  She probably thinks that by taking
the match herself she can prevent Azusa from getting hurt too badly,&quot;
Kasumi explained.  She blushed and envy filled her as she looked at her
sister.  *Would Ranma have said that to Mikado if I were in there?*
Kasumi wondered.

        &quot;She&#39;s right, Kodachi,&quot; Nabiki said, while frantically clicking on
her camera which nearly every male in the arena were doing.  *There goes the
photo business,* Nabiki shook her head sadly.  The monopoly on Ranma
photos just dropped drastically.

        &quot;What is that?&quot; Kodachi asked as the Golden Pair formed a pillar
with Ranma and Akane on top.

                        * * * * *

        Azusa&#39;s lips tingled.  She had been surprised to find the tactic of
kissing one of the partners to enrage the other had worked on this pair
of girls.  She had been even more surprised when Ranma had pressed her
lips back in reply and that Azusa had liked it.

        Mikado hated to admit but he was getting dizzy.  Never before had
their opponents outlasted him when he applied the couple cleaver.  &quot;Let go,
Azusa!  Let the two idiot girls fall together if they want that so
much.&quot;

        Azusa found herself reluctant to let go as the memory of Ranma&#39;s
kiss still played out in her mind.

        &quot;Azusa, let go.  I don&#39;t want you to get hurt too.&quot;

        Azusa gasped.  That voice came from above.  She could feel Ranma&#39;s
legs try to shake off her hands.  Azusa gritted her teeth and held on.

        &quot;Azusa?&quot; Mikado asked out.  He couldn&#39;t hold out much longer.  Did
that stupid girl fall asleep or something?  *Nice knowing you, Azusa,* Mikado
thought and let go.

                        * * * * *

        Azusa opened her eyes.  She didn&#39;t feel any pain at all.  That was
not the experience she expected to have after being flung with the speed of
a freight train towards the wall.  She saw the girl Akane look at her
with what she thought was the same expression on her own face.

        *What happened?*  Akane looked around for Ranma.  A groan from
underneath her answered she her question.  She blushed as she got off of
Ranma&#39;s face.  Her expression turned to horror as she realized what
Ranma had done.  &quot;You idiot!&quot;  Akane blinked.  She had wanted to yell
that out but someone had beat her to the punch.

        &quot;You idiot!&quot; Azusa repeated as she threw herself over Ranma&#39;s prone
form.  &quot;You didn&#39;t have to do that.  I&#39;m your enemy, remember?&quot;  Her
tears flowed even harder as she heard Ranma whisper, telling her not to
cry.

        &quot;I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;re all right, Azusa.  My hands must have
slipped...&quot; Mikado had no chance to finish his apology as his mouth was
suddenly wrapped up with the end of a ribbon and he found himself flying
towards the wall in a similar fashion Ranma had.

        Azusa flashed a look of gratitude to the newcomer before looking
back at Ranma.  &quot;You win.  Mikado&#39;s out cold.  Char... P-Chan is yours.&quot;

        &quot;Really?  Okay, since he&#39;s mine, I get to decide what happens.  You
can visit him whenever you want,&quot; Ranma said, struggling to get up and
failing.  Her arms, along with every part of her body felt like mush.

        Azusa was at a loss to what to say.  The tears just didn&#39;t seem like
they would end today.  There were no words that could express her
feelings at this moment, so she didn&#39;t even try.  Instead, she just
brought her face down to Ranma&#39;s and gave the girl a real kiss this
time.  It lasted for about a minute fore the girl Ranma called as her
fianc&eacute;e broke them up.

        &quot;Hey, what do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot; Akane asked, and was mirrored
by Kodachi as she approached them.

        &quot;Just giving my thanks,&quot; Azusa said, not backing down from the two
angry glares.  *I think it would be safer for Ranma not to tell them of
the tongue she gave me,* Azusa decided.  These two were lucky girls.

        &quot;Bwee!&quot; Ryoga called out and jumped on to Ranma&#39;s chest, staking his
territory as he looked up at angrily at the perverts above him.

        &quot;Oh, Kasumi, did you have to let him go this early?&quot; Akane asked
plaintively as her sisters approached and dropped P-Chan on top of
Ranma.

        &quot;Ranma deserves it.  Look how happy she is,&quot; Kasumi said, smiling.

        &quot;You&#39;re a regular &#39;golden girl&#39;,&quot; Nabiki told her fianc&eacute;e with a
sigh. She looked over at the gushing group of girls that hovered around 
Ranma and in particularly, Azusa.  *Your niceness towards all girls will be
the death of you, Ranma,* Nabiki predicted.

        It was then the wall in front of them crashed to the ground.  Dust
billowed up covering the cause of the crash.  &quot;Ranma!&quot; a voice called
out from within the dusty mist.  &quot;Wife come back with Shampoo!&quot;
