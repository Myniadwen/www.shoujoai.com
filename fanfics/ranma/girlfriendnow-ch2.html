<h1>She's Got a Girlfriend Now (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/girlfriendnow-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Soun Tendo and Genma Saotome watched in a certain degree of shock as 
Ranma and Kasumi walked off together, holding hands shyly. &quot;Ranma&#39;s 
seeing both Kasumi and Akane?&quot; Soun roared, &quot;What are you going to do 
about this, Genma!?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a perfectly rational explanation for this,&quot; Genma said 
weakly, the bald fighter pushing up his glasses.

&quot;Yes, they&#39;ve both lost their minds,&quot; Akane growled before the black 
haired girl stomped off to her room.

The caf&eacute; was chosen carefully, both for serving good food and not being 
near either Shampoo or Ukyo&#39;s restaurants. The host nodded as he 
confirmed the reservation and lead them to a table, then returning to 
deliver their orders with smooth skill.

&quot;Here,&quot; Ranma held out Kasumi&#39;s chair for her, the redheaded girl 
remembering seeing someone do something like this in a movie.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Kasumi said, the black haired older girl&#39;s smile showing 
Ranma she was doing the right thing.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Ranma blushed as she sat down to eat. She was nervous 
as they began to chat, but she found Kasumi to be a remarkably 
nonthreatening individual. In fact, she hadn&#39;t been this comfortable 
with someone in a long time.

&quot;You and your father spend so much time training,&quot; Kasumi teased gently 
as they ate, &quot;I still feel I barely know you.&quot;

&quot;When you appeared in the doorway wearing that dress I thought much the 
same,&quot; Ranma admitted with a shy smile, &quot;I&#39;m surprised the guys aren&#39;t 
beating down the door to see you.&quot;

Kasumi smiled, &quot;Why, thank you Ranko.&quot;

Ranma blushed, a charmingly innocent gesture. &quot;Just telling the truth,&quot; 
she said honestly. She hesitated, &quot;I always thought you and Dr. Tofu...&quot;

Kasumi shook her head as she drank a bit, &quot;He was a friend, but that&#39;s 
all.&quot; A gentle smile, &quot;I&#39;ve never seemed to find the one I&#39;m looking 
for.&quot;

&quot;I know how that feels,&quot; Ranma nibbled her food nervously, &quot;a horde of 
crazy fiancees but I don&#39;t love any of &#39;em.&quot;

Kasumi looked curious, &quot;Even Akane?&quot;

Ranma looked embarrassed, &quot;I like her well enough, but...&quot;

Kasumi reached across the table to gently squeeze Ranma&#39;s hand as she 
said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I shouldn&#39;t have put you on the spot.&quot; Remarkably 
cheerfully she added, &quot;Let&#39;s finish our dinner, shall we?&quot;

&quot;Ah, right,&quot; Ranma agreed, silently deciding that she&#39;d never understand 
women.

Not that far away and outside the caf&eacute; Tatewaki Kuno looked down at 
Nabiki, the tall, black haired kendoist looking faintly shocked. &quot;My 
beloved pigtailed girl belongs to someone other than that foul Ranma?!&quot; 
he blurted.

&quot;I was surprised myself,&quot; Nabiki said, the middle sister of the Tendo 
family dressed in casual clothes, unlike Kuno&#39;s samurai like garb.

&quot;I&#39;ll defeat the miscreant,&quot; Kuno produced a wooden practice sword from 
his clothes, &quot;and claim her for myself.&quot;

Nabiki grabbed him by the arm before he could rush off, &quot;Not so fast.&quot; 
Giving him a stern look she said, &quot;It wouldn&#39;t be honorable.&quot;

&quot;How so?&quot; Kuno demanded.

&quot;Here,&quot; Nabiki handed him a set of binoculars.

Kuno peered towards the table, his gaze first settling on the lovely 
pigtailed girl. Ah, so innocent, so full of life, Kuno dreamed of 
enfolding her in her arms and never letting her go. Very reluctantly he 
shifted his gaze over to take in her odious dining companion, only to 
visibly do a double take.

&quot;Two women?&quot; Kuno blinked, &quot;Is that your sister, Nabiki?&quot;

&quot;Yes, she started seeing that girl a few weeks ago,&quot; Nabiki lied glibly, 
&quot;once I realized she was the same girl you&#39;re interested in, I contacted 
you.&quot;

&quot;A friendship between two women is not my concern,&quot; Kuno said gruffly, 
though he didn&#39;t give up the view through the binoculars.

&quot;Watch the two of them together,&quot; Nabiki said, feeling faintly surprised 
at how good actors Ranma and Kasumi were.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Kuno murmured, distracted by the swell of the redhead&#39;s breasts 
beneath her blouse. But as ordered he watched them laughing and talking, 
as well as the long, lingering glances that Kasumi gave his beloved. 
&quot;That doesn&#39;t mean,&quot; Kuno cleared his throat uncomfortably, &quot;they&#39;re not 
just friends.&quot;

&quot;Last time they were out I followed them to a love hotel,&quot; Nabiki looked 
up, hiding her amusement as she said, &quot;want to come along this time?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Kuno gulped.

Kasumi and Ranma left the caf&eacute; together, both full and feeling 
remarkably content with the world. They walked together, then Kasumi 
slid her fingers gently into Ranma&#39;s. The redhead looked a bit startled 
then held on firmly, smiling.

&quot;You saw them?&#39; Ranma asked softly.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; a slightly distracted Kasumi blinked.

&quot;Taking my hand,&quot; Ranma said as they walked slow, &quot;I thought you did it 
because you saw Kuno and Nabiki back there.&quot;

&quot;Actually,&quot; Kasumi smiled wryly, &quot;I took your hand because I wanted to, 
Ranko.&quot;

Ranma looked at her, a blush coloring the slightly smaller woman&#39;s 
cheeks. &quot;I&#39;ve been having fun, too,&quot; she admitted, &quot;it&#39;s a new 
experience.&quot;

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Kasumi agreed. Out of the corner of her eye she saw Kuno trip 
over a garbage can and did her best to pretend not to notice, &quot;I think 
we&#39;d better finish this before Kuno&#39;s distraction gets him killed.&quot;

&quot;Tempting,&quot; Ranma flashed a smile that made her look even cuter, &quot;but 
you&#39;re right.&quot; She pulled a sheet of paper out, &quot;Now where&#39;s that love 
hotel...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m surprised that Nabiki knew exactly where it is,&quot; Kasumi remarked as 
they picked up the key for the room Nabiki reserved for them.

&quot;You think that...?&quot; Ranma looked surprised as they went up to the 
second floor.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure and I don&#39;t know if I want to find out,&quot; Kasumi said as 
the reached room number sixty nine. &quot;Nabiki has a odd sense of humor,&quot; 
she added as Ranma used the key to open the door.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Ranma blinked.

&quot;Never mind.&quot;

The room was much like your typical hotel room, but for Ranma is looked 
oddly sinister. This was her first time in a place like this, and though 
she would never admit it to anyone, she was a virgin in both her forms. 
While she didn&#39;t expect Kasumi to ravish her, Ranma really only had the 
vaguest idea of what they might be doing.

&quot;What,&quot; Ranma&#39;s voice squeaked a bit, &quot;do we do now?&quot;

&quot;Ranko, it&#39;s all right,&quot; Kasumi&#39;s voice and touch on her shoulder were 
comforting, &quot;we just have to act a few moments after Nabiki gives us the 
signal.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Ranma smiled, noticing the lovely scent that Kasumi seemed to 
carry with her. She gulped, &quot;I guess we have to undress?&quot;

&quot;If you want I can go change in the bathroom,&quot; Kasumi offered as she 
nodded to the room connected to the bedroom.

With a blush the normally brash Ranma said, &quot;No, it&#39;s all right.&quot;

With simple elegance Kasumi reached behind her, her breasts rising 
distractingly as she undid the buttons. The red dress took some wiggling 
to pull down, and Ranma gulped at the black, lacy underwear that Kasumi 
had chosen to wear.

&quot;Am I the only one getting undressed?&quot; Kasumi teased, standing there in 
bra, panties, garter belt and stockings.

&quot;Right,&quot; the now fiercely blushing Ranma began to undress.

Kasumi watched with interest as the white blouse came off first, 
revealing a white and sadly plain bra underneath. Her full bosom bounced 
a bit as she bent to undo the clasp of her skirt, a unknowingly sexy 
wiggle of her hips helping her remove them. Underneath that was a piece 
of more daring underwear, the high cut panties looking sexy on the 
athletic girl.

&quot;You look lovely,&quot; Kasumi said as she took Ranma&#39;s hand, drawing her 
towards the neatly made bed.

&quot;You&#39;re beautiful,&quot; Ranma said, her eyes just a little wide.

Kasumi drew the white sheets aside, glad only to smell cleaning 
materials as they climbed into the comfortable bed together. She touched 
the stiff shoulder of Ranma and chuckled, then rolled so that they were 
laying right beside each other.

&quot;I have a confession to make,&quot; Kasumi admitted softly.

Tatewaki Kuno stood on a lamppost outside, trying to get a better view 
of the room where he had just seen Ranma and Kasumi dressed in the most 
scandalous of undergarments. Nose bleeding slightly he awkwardly tried 
to get a good angle with his digital camera when a flung rock took him 
by surprise and sent him crashing to the ground.

&quot;How dare you, Tendo Nabiki,&quot; Kuno growled.

&quot;Photo&#39;s of this special event are available exclusively through me,&quot; 
Nabiki said flatly.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Kuno looked at her blankly.

&quot;I know which room they&#39;re in,&quot; Nabiki said as she tugged him to his 
feet, &quot;and put two digital cameras in there on timers. I&#39;ll get a lot 
better pics than you ever could.&quot;

&quot;Nabiki,&quot; Kuno looked at her wide eyed, &quot;I&#39;m in awe.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll contact you about pricing soon,&quot; Nabiki said casually. Leading him 
away she asked seriously, &quot;Are you going to interfere?&quot;

Kuno sighed softly. &quot;To interfere with such a beautiful joining of two 
souls,&quot; he said, &quot;would be dishonorable.&quot; He brightened visibly, &quot;So 
instead I will focus my full efforts on winning my lovely Akane!&quot;

&#39;Sorry sis,&#39; Nabiki thought wryly as they walked off, &#39;you&#39;re on your 
own.&#39;

Kasumi stroked Ranma&#39;s hair, kissing her sweetly before drawing back, 
leaving them both breathless. &quot;Do you believe me now,&quot; she said 
teasingly, &quot;when I say I&#39;m attracted to you?&quot;

Ranma chuckled softly. &quot;That&#39;s pretty convincing,&quot; the smaller redhead 
admitted, surprised at how nice it felt to be held in Kasumi&#39;s arms.&quot;Why 
didn&#39;t you say anything sooner?&quot; she asked as she looked up into 
Kasumi&#39;s eyes.

&quot;There was so much craziness after you came,&quot; Kasumi pointed out, &quot;and 
after the first few months it seemed kind of awkward to go to your room 
and confess I carried a unrequited passion for you.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Ranma snuggled close, heart beating fast at how nice it felt, 
laying beside Kasumi. &quot;It&#39;s going to be a mess, you know, with Akane and 
all the rest of the fiancees.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll handle it,&quot; Kasumi drew her close, &quot;tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Why tomorrow?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Because we&#39;re in bed tonight,&quot; Kasumi purred, &quot;and I intend for us to 
get full use of this room Nabiki rented.&quot;

Ranma blushed red.

End.

Notes: This is my first &quot;full&quot; Ranma &frac12; fic, so if I&#39;ve erred in 
characterizations let me know. This was inspired by various Ranma fics 
including those of John Garret (johnnyG on as well as the song &#39;She has 
a girlfriend now&#39; by Reel Big Fish. Why is Ranma less agressive here? 
He&#39;s like that due to inexperience with dating, mostly. Tho Kasumi may 
be a &#39;top&#39; ...</pre>
