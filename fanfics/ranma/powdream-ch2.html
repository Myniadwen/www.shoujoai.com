It was dark. Shampoo couldn&#39;t see anything. She could feel that she
was lying down on the ground, and then she could tell that she was naked,
she could feel the ground&#39;s smoothness on her skin. She stared at the
pitch black sky, not knowing if it was sky, it felt like she was
indoors. She didn&#39;t know what to think. It was peaceful where she was,
so she began to enjoy just lying there. Begin naked didn&#39;t seem to
bother her.

Then something happened. Something blocked her view of the &#39;sky&#39;.
It was Ranma, standing over her, looking her in the eyes.
She was surprised and pleased by this. She didn&#39;t move as she spoke to
him. &quot;Ohh......Ranma? Make love to Shampoo Ranma?&quot; He smiled and nodded
his head. Shampoo was overjoyed, she closed her eyes and clenched her
fists in anticipation of Ranma&#39;s touch. But then, something unexpected
happened. She could feel a pair of female hands pinning her shoulders
down. She opened her eyes to see a naked female Ranma sitting over her,
holding her down.

Normally this might of shocked Shampoo, but to her surprise, she didn&#39;t
seem to mind this at all. More than anything, she wanted Ranma,
male or female, to make love to her. Ranma looked up, as if something was
approaching. Shampoo looked in the same direction, only to see darkness.
But then something appeared from the darkness, two naked women, walking
towards them from a shroud of darkness. She could only tell that they were
women, possibly about her age. Then they reached Shampoo, and she could
see who they were. It was Akane and Ukyo.

&quot;Huh? Spatula Girl? Violent Girl? Why....&quot; They stared at her with very
loving eyes, stopping her short of finishing her sentence as she looked
back at them, surprised by the way they were acting, and by the fact that
they were naked, which were conjuring very new feelings inside of
Shampoo. &quot;Answer Shampoo, why girls here, interrupting sexy time with Ranma?
This too too weird!&quot;

She struggled to get up to face the girls, Ranma was still holding her down.
She looked at the girls in horror as lay down on both sides of her.
She wanted to get up, she wanted to get out of here. But she couldn&#39;t
escape, she was being held down by all three of them now. She struggled a
little with them, until she saw Ukyo close her eyes and slowly move her head
towards her. She knew what was coming and struggled furiously with them,
trying to escape. &quot;No...Spatula Girl, no kiss me.&quot; Then in the corner of her
eye, she spotted Akane, moving her head down towards her groin, sending
Shampoo into a panic.

&quot;NO! Violent Girl! No kiss me there!! Help Ranma! No!! (gasp) No, Shampoo,
(gasp) Shampoo....&quot; She was prevented from finishing her sentence by Ukyo&#39;s
lips, as she began to kiss her. She began to stop struggling. It was as if
Ukyo&#39;s kiss was draining Shampoo of her strength. She was too weakened to
react when she felt Akane begin to kiss her vulva. At first she was
horrified with what Akane was doing to her, but then it began to feel good
to her. She was beginning to like this. Ukyo stopped kissing her mouth,
and started kissing her neck and chest, freeing Shampoo to speak again.

&quot;(sigh) Oh...Oh....Spatula Ukyo, Oh, Violent Akane...Ukyo...kiss Shampoo,
love Shampoo, Akane?.......Ukyo?......Akane?!.....Ukyo?!&quot;

------------------------------------------

&quot;AIYA!! AKANE!!!.....Ukyo....(gasp)no.&quot; Shampoo found herself in her bed,
it was just a dream. She lay back down, and wiped the sweat from
her brow. &quot;No.....not again.&quot; Shampoo was more frustrated than confused
about her dream. On Thursday night, she had the same marriage dream as
Akane and Ukyo, and now this. First the girls kissed her in the dream,
and now they were making love to her. She felt as if she was loosing her
mind.

Images, thoughts, feelings, all about her rivals for Ranma&#39;s heart, Akane
and Ukyo, filled her head. She couldn&#39;t think about anything else as she
lay there. How could it happen? How could she have feelings for girls
she doesn&#39;t even like? Why both of them? Why now? She couldn&#39;t sleep
anymore, she got up, it was nearly time for her training anyway.

She spent most of the morning practicing her moves at the back of the
Cat Cafe as Cologne watched her. She couldn&#39;t concentrate, her moves
were sloppy and slow, the dream had affected her that much.
&quot;Come on Shampoo! You can do better than that!&quot; On hearing that
Shampoo began to push herself harder, but struggled with each move since
the concentration wasn&#39;t there. She set herself up for a jump kick,
only to trip herself up and fell to the ground in a puff a dust.
She didn&#39;t bother to get up, she just lay there as Cologne walked over
to her.

&quot;Ok Shampoo...what&#39;s on your mind?&quot; &quot;Shampoo ok, nothing on mind.&quot;
&quot;You were making mistakes only a beginner would make. Something is
bothering you. What is it?&quot; Shampoo sits up. &quot;(sigh) Shampoo have.....
weird dreams.&quot; &quot;Dreams huh? Tell me about them.&quot; Said Cologne as she
sat down beside her. Shampoo began to blush as she thought of her
dreams. &quot;Shampoo can&#39;t tell!! Dreams.....embarrassing.&quot;

&quot;Embarrassing dreams? I could tell you what they mean if you describe
them to me.&quot; &quot;No!! Shampoo can&#39;t!!&quot; Said Shampoo, almost in tears.
&quot;You can trust me Shampoo, I won&#39;t judge you or tell anyone else about
what you tell me.&quot; &quot;(sniff) Emm... (sniff) Shampoo tell, but no-one
ever hear of dreams. Promise?&quot; &quot;I promise, now, tell me about them.
When did they start?&quot; &quot;(sniff) Thursday night. Shampoo dream of big
wedding with Ranma in temple.&quot; &quot;You dreamt of your wedding day?&quot;
Shampoo nodded. &quot;But Shampoo not only bride at wedding. Violent Girl
and Spatula Girl also brides.&quot; &quot;So..the dream was about your rivalry
with Akane and Ukyo.&quot;

&quot;No, Shampoo not finished. Things at wedding turn weird. All guests
become naked women. Akane and Ukyo turn naked, and Ranma turn naked
as girl. Then...(sniff)...Akane and Ukyo pin Shampoo to ground and
kiss Shampoo.(sniff)&quot; &quot;Hmm...you just called them by their real names
didn&#39;t you?&quot; Shampoo nodded, her eyes waterlogged with tears.
&quot;Interesting...I wonder? Did you dream of them last night?&quot;
She nodded again as she began to cry. &quot;(sniff) A...Akane and Ukyo
make love to Shampoo in dark place. (sniff) Shampoo is so confused!
What do dreams mean?!&quot; &quot;Well...let me see then.&quot;

Cologne puts her hand on Shampoo&#39;s forehead, as if she was checking
for fever. &quot;Hmm.....ahh.....OH! I haven&#39;t seen this in a long time.&quot;
&quot;Wh..what? Tell Shampoo.&quot; &quot;Do you remember the Legend of Ryu and Ama?&quot;
Shampoo jumps to her feet, shocked and horrified at what Cologne
had just suggested. &quot;NO!! Shampoo not like them!! Shampoo not in love
with Akane and Ukyo!!&quot; &quot;Really Shampoo? Is that so? I&#39;ve noticed that
you&#39;ve stopped calling them by those names you gave them.&quot; Shampoo
calmed down a bit, and began to blush.

&quot;Let me remind you of the Legend of Ryu and Ama. Ryu and Ama were two
young women from neighbouring villages who had never met. But when
they both came of age, they dreamt of making love to each other,
for 30 days and 30 nights, and on the last day they finally met each
other, and fell in love at first sight and gave each other the Kiss of
Death. They stayed together for the rest of their lives and are said
to have had the first Amazon lesbian wedding. To this day, all lesbian
Amazon couples go through the same wedding ceremony that Ryu and Ama
invented all those years ago. I probably left out some details but you
get the idea.&quot;

&quot;Shampoo always confused about Legend of Ryu and Ama. How strangers
dream of each other?&quot; &quot;You do know that dreams are caused by your
ghost learning to leave your body?&quot; &quot;Yes, Shampoo knows. Shampoo&#39;s
ghost prepares for journey to afterlife while Shampoo sleeps.&quot;
&quot;Alright then. Sometimes you have &#39;shared&#39; dreams. This happens
when your ghost comes in contact with someone else&#39;s ghost. If the
dream is about love or love making, it means your ghost as sought
out the ghost of someone you really care about, and maybe even
love.&quot;

&quot;Shampoo dreams of Ukyo and Akane because Shampoo loves them?&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot; &quot;NOT RIGHT!! CAN&#39;T BE RIGHT!! Ukyo and Akane
try to take Ranma away from Shampoo. Shampoo hates Ukyo and Akane!!&quot;
&quot;Oh really? You used to call Ukyo, Spatula Girl and Akane, Violent Girl,
or even Kitchen Destroyer if you felt like it. Now you call them by
their real names. Whatever hatred you had for them before, it&#39;s gone
now.&quot; Shampoo sits down again, and lowers her head in shame.
&quot;Sh....Shampoo not know what to do. Shampoo have sexy dreams about
Akane and Ukyo, and....Shampoo likes them. Shampoo likes to feel touch
of girls in dream. Shampoo....likes to look at Akane and Ukyo&#39;s bodies.&quot;
Shampoo cradles her head in her hands as she began to cry again.

&quot;(sniff) Shampoo so ashamed.&quot; Cologne walks over and gently places
her hand on Shampoo&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Poor Shampoo, you&#39;ve been living here
too long. Being in love with girls is nothing to be ashamed of, it&#39;s
very normal among our people.&quot; Shampoo stopped crying and looked at
Cologne with waterlogged eyes. &quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Of course Shampoo. Haven&#39;t you ever seen how friendly some of the women
are, in our tribe. Well...some of them were in love. (sigh) I wish
things in the tribe could be what they were like before. Nowadays,
Shampoo, our lesbians have to hide their affection from the outside world,
for fear of attracting unwanted media attention, but before, years ago,
our women could be seen openly kissing in public. Oh...and so many other
things too.&quot; &quot;Cologne not ashamed of Shampoo?&quot; &quot;What? Of course I&#39;m not
ashamed, to be honest I think it&#39;s very beautiful when one girl falls in
love with another. You should explore this new side of yourself, I think
you&#39;ll really enjoy it!&quot;

&quot;But..Shampoo loves Akane AND Ukyo. Shampoo also loves Ranma.&quot; &quot;Whoever
said there was a limit on the amount of people you could love? Love
all three of them, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that, it just proves that
you&#39;ve got a big heart.&quot; &quot;Can...can Shampoo marry all three of them?&quot;
&quot;Sure you can, there&#39;s no limit to the number of husbands or wives an
Amazon woman may have. Besides, Akane and Ukyo are very capable warriors,
they would make useful additions to our village. Just give them the
Kiss of Death, then they&#39;ll be engaged to you.&quot;

&quot;Wait...this also confused Shampoo about Legend of Ryu and Ama. How can
Kiss of Death be Kiss of Marriage between two girls?&quot; &quot;A little something
we don&#39;t share too much, is how the Kiss of Death really works. You see,
it becomes a Kiss of Marriage, not because of the gender of who you are
kissing, but by how much you love them. If you really love Akane and
Ukyo, the Kiss of Death will be your engagement to them.&quot;

Shampoo began to smile again, she seemed very happy now. &quot;Ahh, that&#39;s
better. Do you feel better about yourself now?&quot; &quot;Yes, much better.&quot;
&quot;Do you know how you feel about Akane and Ukyo?&quot; &quot;Shampoo....Hee! Hee!
Shampoo maybe loves Akane and Ukyo!&quot; &quot;Maybe loves them?&quot;
&quot;Shampoo DOES love them!!!&quot; She stood up and began jumping around
excitedly after she finally admitted it. &quot;I&#39;m glad to hear it,
you really needed to get that off your chest Shampoo.&quot;
&quot;Hee! Hee! Yes! Yes! Shampoo loves Akane and Ukyo!! Hee! Hee!
Shampoo want to make love to Akane and Ukyo!! Shampoo...&quot;
She stopped jumping around. &quot;....Shampoo not know first thing about
loving girls.&quot; She turns to Cologne and is about to ask her a question.

&quot;Follow me Shampoo. I&#39;ve got something to show you.&quot;

----------------------

They go back into the Cat Cafe and up to the attic, and there Cologne
begins to rummage through some boxes. &quot;I brought these with me, in case
you would need them Shampoo.&quot; &quot;What did Cologne bring?&quot; &quot;You&#39;ll see.
Catch!&quot; Cologne begins throwing scrolls back towards Shampoo, who manages
to catch them all. &quot;What these?&quot; &quot;One of the Amazon&#39;s most closely
guarded secrets. Those scrolls contain relationship advice and sex
manuals, developed by Amazon lesbians over the years, especially for
girls like you Shampoo. They&#39;re to help you decide if this is the path
you want to take, and are a guide on how to take that path.&quot;

Shampoo didn&#39;t know what to say. &quot;Thank yo.....&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t thank me yet...&quot;
Cologne reveals another scroll from behind her back. This scroll looked
far more decorative than the others and astonished Shampoo. She put the
other scrolls to one side and walked up to Cologne to receive this one.
&quot;This Shampoo, is the Holy Grail of Amazon Lesbians. An ancient art of
love making, designed especially for women. Legend has it, that Ryu
invented this technique as a gift for Ama, to thank her for being so
loyal to her.&quot; Shampoo opens the scroll to see a chart of a woman&#39;s body
with points marked out along it.

&quot;The technique merges the knowledge Chinese acupuncture with that of the
Amazon. Those who learn it, may cause great pleasure in her partner,
with a single touch, on any one of these points.&quot; &quot;Thank you,
Shampoo very grateful. Hmm....Shampoo has question.&quot; &quot;Go on.&quot;
&quot;Why no one ever tell Shampoo this? Why Shampoo not learn any of this
when little?&quot; &quot;Why didn&#39;t we tell you more about our lesbian customs
beyond, the Legend of Ryu and Ama? Well...It was mostly to protect our
village. If the outside world learned of how we view lesbianism, our
village would be swamped with perverts in a matter of days. We couldn&#39;t
let that happen. So now we wait to see if our girls choose the lesbian
path, before educating them about it. Read these scrolls Shampoo. Learn
everything they have to teach you. You may need this knowledge soon.
And remember...all of this is useless, unless you actually talk to the
girls.&quot;

Then Shampoo realised it. She wasn&#39;t exactly friends with Akane and Ukyo,
even though she loved them. &quot;Aiya!! Shampoo forgot!! Shampoo enemy of
Akane and Ukyo. Shampoo not know what to do!&quot; &quot;It&#39;s very simple
Shampoo...make up with them and tell them how you feel.&quot;
&quot;But...what if girls say no?&quot; &quot;Better to find out now than to live your
life never knowing how they feel, besides, I have a strange feeling that
maybe those two have been going through the same thing as you.&quot;
&quot;Huh?&quot; &quot;You&#39;ll understand once you study the scrolls. Now come on! You&#39;ve
got work to do!&quot;

Shampoo spent the rest of the weekend studying the scrolls. Every free
moment she had, she would hide in some corner, and read a scroll.
She paid special attention to Ryu&#39;s love making technique. She wanted
to master it, so she could offer something special to girls she loved.

--------------------------------

Monday Morning. The sun was shining, it was a perfect day. Or so it
seemed. Akane walked down the street towards the school.
There was a smile on her face and a song in her heart, she had never
been this happy before. She now had a beautiful girlfriend, like she
had always wanted. She was on top of the world. Just then she ran into
Yuka and Sayuri. &quot;Oh, hiya girls! Lovely morning, isn&#39;t it?&quot;
&quot;Emm yea....it is.&quot; Replied Sayuri, confused with Akane&#39;s unusually
happy mood. The trio begin to head for Furinkan High. Akane just walked
in-between the girls, grinning from ear to ear. Akane&#39;s friends looked
at her, dumbfounded and confused.

&quot;Ok, who are you and what have you done to our Akane?&quot; Ordered Yuka.
&quot;It&#39;s me Yuka. It&#39;s just...I feel really happy today.&quot; &quot;But...you&#39;re
never happy in the morning Akane, your not a morning person.&quot;
Said Yuka in a confused manner. Sayuri examined the look on Akane&#39;s
face. &quot;I know that look! That&#39;s the &#39;I&#39;ve just had sex last
weekend look!&quot; Akane began to blush at the suggestion as Yuka became
excited. &quot;REALLY?! Who was it Akane?! Was it Ranma?&quot; &quot;N...no, no one
had sex with me last weekend.&quot; Sayuri stopped Akane in her tracks.

&quot;Come on! Spill it Akane! Or should I say &#39;The girl formally known as
a virgin?&#39;&quot; &quot;Maybe we should check her Sayuri? See if she&#39;s telling
the truth?&quot; &quot;Good idea Yuka, we&#39;ll see if everything is where it
should be.&quot; The girls begin to gang up on Akane and advanced towards
her menacingly. &quot;Quit it girls! You know I&#39;d break your arms if you
ever tried it.&quot; &quot;Yea, we can believe that...&quot; Said Yuka. &quot;...especially
after what you did to Ranma on Thursday night.&quot; &quot;WHAT?!!! HOW did you
find out about that?!!!&quot; &quot;Oh...Nabiki. She was telling everyone about
it. Well...more like, anyone who could afford it.&quot; Replied Sayuri.
&quot;NABIKI!! THAT BITCH!!! Just wait till I get home today!&quot;

&quot;So Akane...&quot; Said Sayuri suggestively. &quot;...if that is how you treat
the guys you like, you must be an animal in bed!&quot; Akane was about to
correct Sayuri about how she is in bed, when she saw the sly look
on Sayuri&#39;s face. &quot;(Very clever Sayuri. You nearly caught me
out.) I&#39;ll tell you when I find out myself. Anyway, since when have
you two become so seedy? You&#39;ve never quizzed me about my sex life
before?&quot; &quot;Ohh...I don&#39;t know. Things have been pretty slow lately,
we&#39;ve got nothing to talk about.&quot; Moaned Yuka.

They reach Furinkan High and go into their home-room which was fairly
deserted. Akane sat down at her desk while Yuka and Sayuri stood
around her. They all look at Ranma&#39;s empty desk. &quot;Poor guy, I hope
he gets better soon.&quot; Said Yuka as she looked at the desk as if he
was sitting there. &quot;How&#39;s he doing Akane? Have you talked to him
since?&quot; Said Sayuri looking at the desk in the same way.
&quot;He&#39;s...Ok. He&#39;s recovering. He should be ok by next week. (sigh)
I haven&#39;t seen him yet.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; &quot;Well Sayuri, I&#39;m ashamed about
what I did. It&#39;s my fault he&#39;s stuck in bed now. If I didn&#39;t hold
back......I could have...........I could have killed him, I could
have killed the guy I love.&quot;

A tear began to form in Akane&#39;s eye when she finally realised the
scale of her crime. Her friends could see that this was upsetting
her, seeing this empty desk where Ranma should be. &quot;Emm....
How about we change the subject.&quot; Said Yuka cheerfully. She looked
Sayuri in the eyes, as if to tell her something. She got the
message. &quot;Ohh...right, yea. Emm...Akane? We&#39;d like to ask you a
question.&quot; &quot;What kind of question?&quot; &quot;Well you see...&quot; Both her
friends begin to blush. &quot;...we were talking over the weekend about
...stuff.....and we were wondering.....have you ever thought about
....girls?&quot; &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Said Akane as she began to read the
meaning of Sayuri&#39;s question. &quot;She means, have you ever thought
about girls.....(sexually).&quot; Said Yuka in response, with bright
eyed optimism.

Akane began to blush as memories of her night with Ukyo came flooding
back. &quot;Ohh...GROW UP you two!! Stop asking me questions like that!
(sigh) I&#39;m not in the mood to answer them...&quot; &quot;Do you have an answer
Akane?&quot; &quot;Yuka no! It can wait for another time.&quot; Said Sayuri,
scolding her friend for being so insensitive towards Akane.
&quot;Hmm...Have either of you seen Ukyo yet?&quot; &quot;Ukyo? No, not yet. I
expect she&#39;ll be in with everyone else.&quot; &quot;Ohh...ok then, thanks
Sayuri.&quot; Akane&#39;s friends looked at her with some suspicion before
their attention was directed to Hinako, who had entered the
room, followed by their other classmates.

As her friends took their seats, Akane watched the door in quiet
anticipation. Soon enough, Ukyo, the love of her life, she came through
the doorway. She watched her enter the room and sit down as if
nothing else existed. It was as if she was watching her in slow
motion as she moved. Akane had never had a lover before, she didn&#39;t
really know what to do, seeing her for the first time after their night
together. She just staired at her in quiet amazement, and then Ukyo
looked back at her. Akane&#39;s heart jumped when she saw the face of her
girlfriend smiling back at her.

Those eyes, that smile, they had never had such an effect on her
before. &quot;Good Morning Sugar!&quot; said Ukyo cheerfully.
&quot;G...good morning Ukyo.&quot; Replied Akane, still hypnotised by Ukyo&#39;s
smile. Sayuri and Yuka looked at them with increasing interest.
Hinako prepared to begin the class. &quot;Ok class, sit down, we&#39;ve got
plenty of work today, we&#39;re going to pick up where we left off last
week...Where&#39;s Ranma? Why isn&#39;t he here Akane?&quot; &quot;He&#39;s out sick. He&#39;ll
be back by next week.&quot;

&quot;Oh....Alright then, I hope he gets better. Ok everyone, settle down!
We&#39;ll start on page 32....&quot; The class settled down. But Akane was
on edge. She was sitting so close to Ukyo, but she was so far away.
The class began, but Akane couldn&#39;t concentrate, not with Ukyo in the
same room. She wanted to be with her so much. She wanted to hold her,
to kiss her. But she also wanted to keep their relationship secret.
She was tense, she clenched her fists in quiet impatience. If only
the class was over, then maybe she could find somewhere private for
them to be together. Occasionally, she&#39;d look over at Ukyo. Ukyo
seemed to handling it much better than Akane.

That boring English class went on forever, the end was nowhere in
sight. The tension began to build up in Akane. She was like a
volcano, ready to erupt. Akane began to breath heavily.
If she didn&#39;t get relief soon, she&#39;d go insane. She was about to
snap when....she stood up. &quot;Akane? What is it?&quot; Demanded Hinako.
&quot;May I be excused.....please?&quot; &quot;Are you ok Akane?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m fine...
I just....need some air.&quot; &quot;OK then, go.&quot; She left the room in
a hurry. Ukyo watched her as she left, her sudden departure worried
her. Sayuri and Yuka looked at each other with a raised eyebrow.

------------

The class eventually ended. Uyko took Akane&#39;s schoolbag and went
looking for her. &quot;Akane! Where are you sugar?! Akane!(I hope she&#39;s ok)&quot;
Ukyo walked as far as the door of the girl&#39;s bathroom.
&quot;Akane! Akane! Where are........&quot; A hand emerges from the bathroom
and gags Ukyo, before dragging her into the room, and then into a
cubicle which was then locked. Ukyo is released, and was about to
pound the face of however dragged her in there, but then she
realised, it was Akane standing in front of her.

&quot;Akane? What did you do that fo.......&quot; Akane quickly latches onto
Ukyo and began to kiss her. A few seconds later she let go of Ukyo.
&quot;(gasp) (gasp) Ohhh, Ukyo, I needed that.&quot; Akane hugs Ukyo tightly.
&quot;I can&#39;t stop thinking about you Ukyo. I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t call
over yesterday, but we were busy at the dojo.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it!
I was too busy to leave work anyway.&quot; &quot;Your driving me crazy Ukyo!
I hate it when your gone! It&#39;s worse when your in the same room
and I can&#39;t touch you!&quot; &quot;Is that why you left class?&quot; &quot;Uh huh.
I can&#39;t help it, I love you too much.&quot;

&quot;Yea, I know the feeling. It&#39;s been hell without you Akane.&quot;
&quot;How do you cope so well?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t! I&#39;m just acting calm for the
sake of everyone else. You did say you wanted to keep this between
the two of us.&quot; They walk out of the cubicle, Ukyo gives Akane her
schoolbag. &quot;I know I said that, but it&#39;s very hard to keep my
feelings for you bottled up.&quot; &quot;Hmm.....I&#39;m only a beginner to this,
but maybe we should think about....coming out.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s...a big step.
I&#39;m not ready, we should wait until we&#39;ve got Ranma onboard, then
we&#39;ll tell everyone.&quot;

&quot;Whatever makes you happy sugar. But I would like to ask you a favour.&quot;
&quot;Sure.&quot; &quot;Konatsu should know about us. He does live with me, and
well...you know his feelings for me.&quot; &quot;I suppose it&#39;s only fair.
We can trust him?&quot; &quot;Of coarse we can. I&#39;d like you to come over later
today, so we can tell him together.&quot; &quot;Ok! Emm...Ukyo? (When can we do
&#39;it&#39; again?)&quot; &quot;What?! So soon?! (I&#39;d prefer to wait until the
weekend, before we make love again. Is that ok?)&quot; &quot;Ohhh!! I suppose
I can wait!&quot; &quot;Thanks sugar. Come on, we should get to class.&quot;
They give each other a small but loving kiss, to give them the strenght
to get throught the day. Then they leave, hand-in-hand.

The door of the cubicle beside the one Akane and Ukyo were just in,
slowly opens. Sayuri and Yuka emerge from behind it.
&quot;It looks like you were right about Akane, Yuka.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s great to
know...but she&#39;s with Ukyo, and (sigh) they&#39;re already having sex,
and she still wants to be with Ranma!&quot; Yuka begins to sob.
Sayuri held Yuka in her arms and kissed her firmly, supporting her
head all the time. &quot;Don&#39;t cry Yuka.
We can still get her to be with us. We just have to find a way......&quot;

------------------------

Later that day...

Shampoo was at a table in the Cat Cafe, trying her hardest to write a
letter in Japanese. &quot;Ukyo.....Your eyes like beautiful ponds........
NO!!..... THAT NO GOOD! GRRRRR!&quot; Shampoo crumples the letter in
frustration and throws it behind her to a large pile of crumpled
notes. Mousse comes into the room, sweeping the floor. He notices
the huge pile behind Shampoo&#39;s chair. He picks up one of Shampoo&#39;s
failed letters and reads out loud to himself. &quot;Akane....pretty like
horse? What is this Shampoo?&quot; &quot;Hee! Hee! Shampoo write love letter!&quot;
Said Shampoo as she attempted another love letter.

&quot;Love letter? But these look like they&#39;re for Akane or Ukyo. Is that
jerk Ranma making you write his love letters for him?!&quot;
&quot;No, these not for Ranma.&quot; &quot;Then....I don&#39;t understand?&quot;
Shampoo turns to face Mousse. &quot;(sigh) Does Mousse know Legend of Ryu
and Ama?&quot; Mousse&#39;s face suddenly turned pale. &quot;...no...your not....
are you?&quot; Shampoo nodded her head with a smile on her face.
&quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!&quot;
Mousse fell to his knees and yelled towards the ceiling.
&quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOO! IT CAN&#39;T BE TRUE!!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!&quot;
&quot;(Keep it quiet down there!)&quot; Said Cologne&#39;s voice from upstairs.

&quot;Hee! Hee! It true! Shampoo is lesbian, Shampoo loves Akane and Ukyo!!&quot;
&quot;But....Akane and Ukyo? You HATE them!&quot; &quot;Shampoo love them now,
Shampoo&#39;s ghost choose them in sleep, and Shampoo agree with ghost,
girls cute, girls sexy, and girls too too nice!&quot; &quot;Well...at least I
have the satisfaction of knowing that I didn&#39;t lose to Ranma.&quot;
&quot;Shampoo also want Ranma! Hee! Hee!&quot; &quot;What! Aww NO...&quot;
Shampoo crumples up another failed love letter in frustration.
&quot;Grrrrrr! Shampoo no good at this! Emm...Can Mousse help?&quot;
&quot;What? Help you write a love letter to those girls?&quot;

Shampoo gets out of her seat and walks over to Mousse. She puts his
hands into hers and pleads with him. &quot;Please help. For Shampoo?&quot;
&quot;Ohh....Alright! I&#39;ll do it for you! I can never say no to that face!
You want advice?&quot; &quot;Yes advice! How Shampoo find out if girls like her?
How Shampoo tell them how she feels?&quot; &quot;Well...I&#39;m no expert, but
writing them love notes won&#39;t work nowadays. Your gonna have to tell
them in person.&quot; &quot;Is that only way?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m afraid so. Otherwise they
might think it&#39;s some kind of trick, you know those girls don&#39;t
entirely trust you.&quot; &quot;Mousse right! Shampoo must go to girls and
declare her love. Thank you Mousse!&quot; She gives him a small kiss on
the cheek and leaves the Cat Cafe.

Mousse sat down where Shampoo was sitting. He watched her leave in
disbelief. He had just got a kiss from her, but it was a thank you
kiss, for teaching her how to leave him forever. Mousse knew what
path Shampoo was going to take. What he knew, and she didn&#39;t, was
that there was no return from that path. It felt like a small part
of him had just died.

------

Shampoo ran down the street to the main road which connected the Tendo
Dojo with Uyko&#39;s restaurant. She didn&#39;t know which way to go.
To the dojo and Akane, or to Okonomiyaki Ucchan&#39;s and Ukyo?
Which girl first? She loved them both the same. But then something
happened, which made her mind up for her. She saw Akane walking down
the road towards Ucchan&#39;s. She decided to follow Akane and confront
her.

Akane seemed blissfully unaware of Shampoo approaching from behind,
she was looking forward to seeing Ukyo too much to notice her.
Shampoo&#39;s stomach was full of butterflies as she prepared to speak
to her. &quot;(What Shampoo say? &#39;Nihao Akane. Shampoo loves you.&#39;?
No, that no good. &#39;Akane, Shampoo has feelings for long time, about
you...&#39; Hmm... better. &#39;Akane want to go somewhere to kiss?&#39; NO!
That worse!)&quot; Akane stopped in her tracks. Shampoo was frozen where
she stood. She slowly turned her head to see what was behind her.
The young Amazon quickly jumped into an alley and out of sight.

Akane looked down the empty street to see who was there.
&quot;No one? I but I could have sworn....Naaa! I must be hearing things.&quot;
Akane continued towards Ucchan&#39;s. Shampoo lay against the wall of the
alley and when she knew it was safe to, looked out onto the street.
She was disappointed with herself for tucking tail and hiding, when
she could have spoken to Akane. With a heavy heart, she watched Akane
stroll down the street. She wanted to hold that body of her&#39;s so much,
now that she&#39;s seen it for the first time after her dream.

Shampoo produces one of the Amazon scrolls and reads some of it.
&quot;If Shampoo to afraid to talk to girls now, Shampoo must learn all
about girls and find perfect time to talk. Hmm...Shampoo must watch
them...&quot; Little did Shampoo notice the rain clouds beginning to
shroud Nerima.

------------------

Akane strolls into Ucchan&#39;s. It was fairly quiet in the restaurant,
there was literally no one there. Ukyo was at the counter reading a
magazine, she notices Akane&#39;s entrance in the corner of her eye.
She stands up and begins to walk towards a now excited Akane.
&quot;Akane! Sugar! Come here!&quot; Ukyo tightly hugs Akane and kisses her
lightly on the lips. &quot;Wow! Hi Ukyo! Is this the reception I get every
time I come over, now that I&#39;m your &#39;you-know&#39;?&quot; &quot;Only when no one&#39;s
here!&quot; &quot;Oh yea...is business bad or something?&quot; &quot;Oh no. It&#39;s usually
quiet now, it&#39;s not the right time of day to eat okonomiyaki.&quot;

&quot;Emm...(Do you really want to do this?)&quot; &quot;(It has to be done Akane,
it&#39;s better me telling him now, than him finding out from someone
else later. He&#39;s in the kitchen, come on.)&quot; Ukyo takes Akane&#39;s
hand and leads her into the kitchen where Konatsu was cleaning the
dishes. Ukyo began to get nervous, Akane knew this and held on to her
hand tighter as show of support for her girlfriend. &quot;Emm...(gulp)
Konatsu?&quot; &quot;Huh? Yes Ukyo?&quot;

This was very hard for Ukyo to say. &quot;Could.....could you come to my
bedroom when your finished here. I&#39;ve something important to tell you.&quot;
&quot;Emm...sure, or coarse.&quot; &quot;Great, I&#39;ll see you in a few minutes, sugar,
come on Akane.&quot; With much haste Ukyo pulls Akane upstairs to her room.

They both sat on the bed waiting for him. Akane held Ukyo tightly by
shoulders, and tried to be supportive. &quot;It&#39;ll be ok Ukyo, trust me.&quot;
&quot;Thank you sugar, I appreciate what your trying to do for me. I wish
I was as confident.&quot; There was a light knocking at the door.
&quot;Oh....Come in Konatsu!&quot; Konatsu meekly walks into the room.
Akane and Ukyo make space in-between them for him to sit.
&quot;Please sugar, sit down between us.&quot; Konatsu nervously sits down
between the girls. Seconds later both Akane and Ukyo each wrap an
arm, lovingly around Konatsu. He was slightly startled by this.

&quot;Konatsu....sugar. You&#39;ve been my closest friend for so many years
now, and I think it&#39;s only fair that you should know first...&quot;
Ukyo looks into Akane&#39;s eyes for strength. &quot;Konatsu...I&#39;m in love
with Akane. She&#39;s my girlfriend now.....and we&#39;re going to marry
Ranma together.&quot; Konatsu&#39;s heart stopped for a second.
Akane moved closer to Konatsu and spoke. &quot;I really do love Ukyo,
Konatsu, and since your such an important part of her life, I&#39;m
hoping we can become good friends.&quot; Ukyo was almost crying inside,
guilty about what she was doing to him. It was painful for her
to speak to him, knowing what her long time friend must be
feeling now. &quot;Konatsu, I know how much you....love me, and care
for me, in that way. So I know how hard this must be for you and....&quot;

Konatsu breaks free from the girl&#39;s gentle grip and quickly stands
up. &quot;No! Ha! Ha! I&#39;m happy for you! Both of you! You finally found
love! And I&#39;m (sigh) happy for you Ukyo. Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;ve
got some work to finish.&quot; He quickly leaves the room. &quot;No Konatsu!
Come back!&quot; Konatsu quickly closes the door after him. &quot;Hmm...I think
he took it well, Ukyo.&quot; &quot;No Akane, He didn&#39;t take it well at all.
I just broke his heart. (sniff) I...I betrayed him.&quot; Ukyo was about to
cry. Akane saw this and quickly cradled Ukyo&#39;s head on her bussom.
&quot;Don&#39;t cry Ukyo, It&#39;s not your fault that you don&#39;t love him back in
that way. Besides, we can always fix his heart.&quot; &quot;(sniff) How? How can
you fix a broken heart? Ohh...My poor little Konatsu, I&#39;ve betrayed
your years of loyalty.&quot;

&quot;Listen Ukyo, I&#39;ve had boys hanging around me long enough to learn
how they click. If we want Konatsu to forget about you, we&#39;ve gotta
get him someone else. We&#39;ve gotta get him a GIRLFRIEND!&quot;
Ukyo stopped sobbing, sat up quickly and began to blush.
&quot;Get my little sugar....a girlfriend? Hee! Hee! YES! Get him a
girlfriend! But who?&quot; &quot;Ohh..I don&#39;t know we&#39;ll have to look around.&quot;
&quot;We must make this our TOP priority Akane! I won&#39;t rest till I see
my Konatsu hitched with a cute girl!&quot; &quot;Well, ok.&quot;

&quot;Good....and she must be cute, kind, pretty, beautiful, fair, strong,
responsible, irresponsible, fun, happy, bubbly, sexy, cheerful and
a virgin.&quot; &quot;A virgin? Why?&quot; &quot;I want my Konatsu to lose his virginity
to another virgin, like I did with you.&quot; &quot;You know he&#39;s a virgin?&quot;
&quot;Do the math Akane! Of coarse he&#39;s a virgin! But we&#39;ll fix that!&quot;
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll try to find a girl with some of those, &#39;qualities&#39;
but don&#39;t count it. Besides, we should be concentrating on marring
Ranma!!&quot;

&quot;Oh yea, now that you mention it, I found something.&quot; Ukyo rummages
under her bed and finds a copy of the Japanese Constitution, with a
bookmark, marking a specific page which was just read.
&quot;I found this copy of the constitution in the attic. Look at this..&quot;
Ukyo opens the book at the book marked page, titled,
&quot;Marriage (of persons) Act, 1946. (Shogun Cannon Transcript)&quot;
Ukyo gives the book to Akane and points something out.
&quot;Read that sugar.&quot; &quot;Hmm...&#39;The state recognises that a marriage is a
legal union between a man and a woman.&#39; I already knew that! It just
means, (sigh) that we can&#39;t marry Ranma together.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be so sure, that&#39;s the only directive in that act. It was just
copied from the old Shogun laws written centuries ago! They
forgot put a limit on how many marriages a person can have.
We can have two legal marriages together. You and Ranma, and Me and
Ranma. It&#39;s perfectly legal! We can do it Akane! We can marry him
together!!!!&quot; Akane didn&#39;t know what to say. Her dream could come
through. &quot;No way....OHHHH THIS IS SO GREAT! Come here and kiss me!!&quot;

Akane jumps over to Uyko, pinning her on the bed, and began to
kiss her firmly. They pressed their lips firmly together, before
invading  one another with their tongues. They playfully fought for
control as they lay there. They held and kissed each toher for some
time before  they stopped to breath. Akane just lay over Ukyo and
began to play  with her fringe as she spoke. &quot;Ukyo? Are you sure
you don&#39;t want to make love to me now?&quot; &quot;(sigh) I&#39;m sure sugar.
Don&#39;t take it the wrong way, I do want to make love to you, I just
want to take my time and enjoy it. I&#39;ve still got work to do today,
you know.&quot; &quot;Oh...ok, that&#39;s alright. Hey Ukyo, that night we made
love. Did you have a weird dream, where we were naked in a really
dark place?&quot;

&quot;(gasp) I was just going ask you about that sugar! I had that
dream! We were naked, and we walked up to this place where a
naked girl Ranma was holding a naked Shampoo on the ground.&quot;
&quot;And...then we had sex with Shampoo, wow....&quot; &quot;Well....I
kissed her, YOU had sex with her!&quot; &quot;(gulp) Yea, that&#39;s right.&quot;
&quot;Hee! Hee! What did she taste like Akane?&quot; &quot;Hey! That&#39;s not
funny!&quot; &quot;Alright, I&#39;m sorry.(Hee! Hee!)&quot;

They relaxed and lay side by side on the bed. &quot;Akane? Ever think
about Shampoo?&quot; &quot;Shampoo?! You gotta be kidding me.&quot; &quot;Well....
I have. I think she&#39;s kinda cute.&quot; &quot;WHAT?! Oh no Ukyo! YOU&#39;RE
MINE! I&#39;m not giving you up to Shampoo of all people!&quot;
&quot;Hee! Hee! I guess your the really possessive kind! But seriously
Akane, we&#39;ve both seen her naked twice in our dreams. Don&#39;t tell
me you haven&#39;t even thought about her.&quot; &quot;Well...(sigh) she&#39;s
got a nice body, the hair suits her....but it&#39;s Shampoo!! She
can&#39;t be trusted. Don&#39;t get your hopes up about her Ukyo,
I doubt they even know what a lesbian is in that backward
village of her&#39;s!&quot;

&quot;Oh...just a little fantasy I&#39;ve been dreaming up since I turned
lesbian. The whole Amazon thing and everything...Hee! Hee!
Anyway, have you talked to Ranma yet? I hear he&#39;s recovering.&quot;
&quot;Well....no.....I haven&#39;t talked to him yet.&quot; &quot;What? Oh sugar,
you&#39;ve got to talk to him.&quot; &quot;But..I don&#39;t know...&quot;
&quot;Listen, just show him your feminine side. Show him the Akane
I fell in love with, and he&#39;ll forgive you in a second!&quot;

&quot;You think? Really?&quot; &quot;Yea....Now Akane...&quot; Ukyo pulls both of
them to their feet. &quot;...I&#39;ve gotta get back to work.&quot;
&quot;Aww, Ukyo! I don&#39;t want to leave you!&quot; &quot;I know sugar, I&#39;ll
miss you too. But I&#39;m going to work....and you&#39;re
going to Ranma.&quot; &quot;Ohh, alright. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow. (sigh)
But I&#39;ll think of nothing else but you till then.&quot; They kiss
passionately for a few minutes, holding each other like a pair
of statuettes, before leaving the room together.

---------------------

Akane made the trek back home to the dojo, feeling a little
lonely after leaving Ukyo. She was about to enter her home when
she suddenly got the feeling of being watched. She turned around
quickly, only to spot a purple tuff of hair, disappear around the
corner. &quot;(Shampoo? It couldn&#39;t be. Could it? Stop thinking about her
Akane! Your confused enough as it is!)&quot; Akane decided to
ignore this, and enter the dojo.

Shampoo stood hiding around the corner. She was trying to catch
her breath. &quot;(gasp) (gasp) Akane almost catch Shampoo, that close
one! Need to learn where Akane goes during day, to pick perfect
spot to declare love.&quot; Suddenly a clap of thunder echoed overhead,
as rain began to fall. &quot;Oh no! This no good! Shampoo forget raincoat!&quot;
Shampoo darts off as fast she could. She didn&#39;t fancy turning into
a cat today, not with a mission to do.

Akane trudged towards Ranma&#39;s room, trying think of a good,
heart-filled apology for him. She reached his door and took a deep
breath. &quot;Ok....here goes nothing.&quot; She quickly slides the door open,
only to find Kasumi changing Ranma&#39;s bandages, as he lay in bed. Akane
quickly looks away in embarrassment. &quot;Oh I&#39;m sorry! I didn&#39;t know you
were changing his dressing.&quot; &quot;Hee! Hee! Come in Akane. He&#39;s decent, I&#39;m
nearly finished anyway.&quot; Akane slowly moves into the room and stands
beside Kasumi as she finishes wrapping the last of Ranma&#39;s bandages.

Akane looked down at his battered face, as he slept there. &quot;(How
is he?)&quot; Whispered Akane quietly. &quot;No need to whisper Akane!
He&#39;s out-cold. We&#39;ve got him on a cocktail of drugs. They keep him
asleep most of the time, the rest of the time he&#39;s too sleepy
to do anything. That&#39;s a good thing because he needs bed-rest.
He&#39;ll be on his feet in a few days.&quot; Kasumi covers Ranma with the
bed covers, then gathers all the old bandages into a basket and
stands up. She notices the painful expression of remorse on Akane&#39;s
face, and puts her hand on her shoulder as a show of support.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Akane. He&#39;ll forgive you. You know he really likes you.&quot;
Akane smiles a little. &quot;He does...doesn&#39;t he?&quot; &quot;....I&#39;ll leave you
two alone.&quot; Kasumi leaves the room and is about to close the door
after her. &quot;Kasumi.....&quot; She stops. &quot;.....thank you.&quot; She smiles
back at Akane before closing the door. Akane looked back down at
Ranma, and with her heart a little lighter, she decided to make her
peace. &quot;Ranma....I know you mightn&#39;t be able to hear me now, but...
I just wanted to say...I&#39;m sorry...I&#39;m sorry for what I did to you.
I&#39;m....(sigh) I&#39;m sorry for the past few years, the way I&#39;ve treated
you when I should have made you feel at home. (sigh) What I&#39;m really
trying say is......&quot;

Akane knelt down beside the bed, and lowered her head towards Ranma&#39;s.
She gently kisses him on the forehead. &quot;.........(I love you).&quot;
She gets up again, almost rejuvenated from kissing Ranma. &quot;So hang in
there Ranma!! I&#39;m gonna make it up to you! You&#39;ll be the happiest guy
in the world! (Once you find out about me and Ukyo!)&quot; &quot;(Akane! Are you
in there?)&quot; Came Soun&#39;s voice from beyond the bedroom door.
&quot;Yes dad! I&#39;m in here!&quot; Soun enters the room. &quot;Are you ready to go?&quot;
&quot;Go? Go where?&quot; &quot;You know well! We&#39;re going to get you examined.
We have to know what caused you to nearly KILL my future son in law.
Look at him, he&#39;s really beat up!&quot; &quot;But dad! I&#39;ve made my peace with
him.&quot;

&quot;Your not getting out of this Akane. I&#39;m worried about you. Something&#39;s
wrong with you. It might be your hormones, it might be something else.
All I know is that I want to keep you healthy, so I&#39;m taking you to this
specialist I know.....&quot;

----------------

Cologne was sitting in the Cat Cafe reading the paper, and watching the
rain as it poured down. The cafe had just closed for the evening.
Just then, she heard some scratching at the door.
She went to the door and opened it, only to see a soaked cat crawl
inside. &quot;Ohh...Shampoo!! You should have know better than to go out in
this kind of weather! Stay here, I&#39;ll get the hot water.&quot; She gets a kettle
of hot water and pours it on Shampoo. Soon enough, Shampoo returned to her
normal human self. Cologne hands her a small to towel to dry herself off.
She got to her feet, and used the towel to cover her pride,
since it wasn&#39;t big enough to cover anything else. Shampoo looks
around nervously. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Shampoo, Mousse isn&#39;t here.&quot; On
hearing that Shampoo relaxed, and hung the towel on her shoulder.

She didn&#39;t seem to mind Cologne seeing her naked. &quot;Ok Shampoo, where
did you lose the clothes THIS time?&quot; &quot;Clothes washed down street by
rain water, Shampoo couldn&#39;t catch.&quot; &quot;The amount of clothes you&#39;ve
gone through since you got that curse. You&#39;ve got to learn to be more
careful. One of these days you&#39;ll be caught in a summer shower, and
find yourself running naked around the streets of Nerima. You might get
away with that back home, but not here in Japan!&quot; &quot;(sigh) Shampoo
knows.....&quot; &quot;Good see that your doing your exercises, like I told you
to.&quot; Said Cologne as she looked at Shampoo&#39;s torso. &quot;They&#39;ll keep
sleek and aerodynamic so you can do your more advanced moves.&quot;

Cologne began to read Shampoo&#39;s face. &quot;What&#39;s wrong Shampoo? Have
you talked to the girls yet?&quot; Shampoo shook her head.
&quot;Oh, so that&#39;s the problem, you haven&#39;t talked to them.&quot;
Shampoo nodded. &quot;Sh...Shampoo try and talk to them. But when
Shampoo get close to talk, Shampoo panic and run away! Ohh!
This annoying! Maybe another way? Shampoo has sexy body. Maybe
seduce girls with Amazon Love Dance?&quot; Said Shampoo as she attempted
a series of very erotic moves.

&quot;Shampoo...I tried to teach you the Love Dance years ago. You were
never patient enough to learn each stage as I thought them, and now
you can&#39;t do it!&quot; Shampoo trips herself up and crashes to the ground.
&quot;See what I mean? If you had learned it right, you could have bagged
Ranma a long time ago. (sigh) But I suppose living here has given you
inhibitions, which would stop you dancing naked in front of a
non-Amazon or a man.&quot; &quot;What?! That not true! Shampoo still follow
Amazon ways!&quot; &quot;Then prove it! Go to those girls and tell them you
love them!!&quot; &quot;(Shampoo not sure if girls like her).&quot; &quot;Really?&quot;
&quot;So.....Shampoo follow girls around and see what they do! Then
Shampoo will know what they think, and best time to declare love!&quot;

&quot;Shampoo...that&#39;s stalking. It&#39;s illegal here...&quot; &quot;Shampoo get away
with following before! Ranma never catch Shampoo watching him when
taking shower! Hee! Hee!&quot; Cologne looked at Shampoo dumbfounded,
as her great-great-great granddaughter giggled at remembering this.
&quot;(sigh) I don&#39;t know anymore. Shampoo, you do what you think is
best and suffer the consequences. Oh and Shampoo?&quot; &quot;Yes?&quot;
&quot;Get some clothes on before Mousse gets back. I&#39;ll never be able
to get any work out of him if he&#39;s got a hard-on.&quot; &quot;Opps! Shampoo
forgot! Hee! Hee!&quot; She runs off. &quot;(sigh) Where did I go wrong?&quot;

-----------------------

Soun walks Akane down the main street or Nerima, protecting
her from the rain with a massive umbrella. &quot;Where are we
going dad?&quot; &quot;You&#39;ll see...&quot; Akane couldn&#39;t really see where they
were going, the rain was too heavy, she had to put her trust
into her father for direction. Soon Akane was delivered to the
porch of a building which was very familiar to her.
&quot;Dr. Tofu&#39;s place? But he&#39;s been gone for ages.&quot; &quot;Nerima has a
new doctor at this practice.&quot; Said Soun as he folded the
umbrella. &quot;New doctor?&quot; This perplexed Akane as they entered,
at least until she saw Dr. Tofu inside. &quot;Dr. Tofu?!! But...but
I&#39;d thought you&#39;d gone forever!&quot; Said Akane as she began to
blush at the sight of the man she used to have a crush on.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m back now, and better than ever!&quot; Said Dr. Tofu proudly.
&quot;But Dad? You said Nerima has a new doctor?&quot; &quot;And it does. Your
talking to Dr. Tofu M.D.&quot; &quot;You got a PHD?!!!&quot; &quot;Yep! That&#39;s why I
was gone! I wanted to provide a full medical service to my clients,
especially the Tendo family.&quot; &quot;Let me guess, this is so you can
finally perform something on Kasumi? Isn&#39;t it?&quot; &quot;Ahh Kasumi...
How is she?&quot; &quot;Still very available!&quot; Said Soun suggestively.
&quot;That&#39;s good to know, very good to know.&quot; &quot;Wait a minute. Dr. Tofu?
How could you get a PHD in such a short time? It takes many years
to get one!&quot; Asked Akane suspiciously.

&quot;I took the day AND night courses at the same time. Got the PHD
in half the normal time. Good thing I had these Pep pills, or I
wouldn&#39;t of made it.&quot; Said the doctor as he popped a pep pill
right in front of them. &quot;You want one? They&#39;re refreshingly
addictive!!&quot; &quot;Emm...No....&quot; Said Akane and Soun at once, almost
like twins. &quot;Doctor? Do you think you can find what&#39;s wrong with
my daughter?&quot; &quot;Well...the symptoms you described to me could be
just about anything. So I&#39;m going to give Akane a full medical exam,
and blood work test.&quot; &quot;Ok, sounds good! Don&#39;t you think so Akane?&quot;
She looked at the both them nervously once the word &#39;Medical Exam&#39;
was mentioned.

&quot;Akane, If you would follow me into the examination room.&quot;
He starts to bring her into a large room of the building where
he used to brake backs. Soun was following them closely.
&quot;Ohh, Soun? I don&#39;t think it would be appropriate for you to be
present for the exam. You should go to the waiting room.&quot;
&quot;But I....&quot; Dr. Tofu closes the door in Soun&#39;s face.
&quot;I feel sorry for you Akane, having a hypochondriac for a father.&quot;
&quot;Ohh, you get used to it. At least he looks out for me.&quot;

&quot;I suppose he does. Now, I you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like you to get
undressed behind those blinds.&quot; &quot;Undressed?! You mean naked?!&quot;
&quot;Well...yea? It&#39;s a medical exam. I can&#39;t examine you through your
clothes.&quot; &quot;Ohhh!!! (sigh) Ok.....&quot; Akane went behind some
blinds in the corner of the room and began to slowly remove her
clothes. &quot;Has anything interesting happened since I left Akane?
Your father hasn&#39;t told me much.&quot; &quot;Ohh...You know this place,
something strange usually happens every week.&quot; &quot;I know about
what happened last week, but how are things between you and
Ranma?&quot; &quot;Well...you know....&quot; Akane is interrupted by a buzzing
noise close to her. Suddenly the silhouette of a skeleton moves
past the blinds.

&quot;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!&quot; &quot;That? It&#39;s just
Betty.&quot; &quot;But it&#39;s moving around!&quot; &quot;You can thank my collage
room mates for that. They majored in robotics.&quot; Akane peeks out
from behind the blinds and sees Betty moving around the room with
wheels attached to it&#39;s legs. &quot;What the?&quot; Akane returns to
undressing. &quot;Why did you have Betty turned into a radio controlled
skeleton?&quot; &quot;She&#39;s much more than that! She&#39;s a fully working robot
nurse! The very first of her kind! I just need to find her a nurses&#39;
uniform, and she&#39;ll be complete!&quot;

&quot;(Oh brother. The pressure has finally got to him!)&quot; Muttered Akane
as she struggled to take off her socks. &quot;Did I mention that she can
follow vocal commands? Betty....could you get me my surgical gloves?&quot;
&quot;[At once doctor!!]&quot; Replied Betty in a voice that sounded like
Dr. Tofu pretending to sound like a woman. Akane couldn&#39;t hold in
her laughter. &quot;Ha! Ha! Ha! It sounds like YOU!! Ha! Ha! Ha!&quot; She
was in fits of laughter as she removed her underwear. Dr. Tofu
wasn&#39;t impressed. &quot;Are you done undressing, Akane?&quot;

&quot;Emm...yea...&quot; &quot;Then come on out here, and we&#39;ll start.&quot;
&quot;Emm...I don&#39;t wanna...&quot; &quot;Akane.....come out, or I&#39;ll bring your
father in.&quot; &quot;(sigh) Alright then.&quot; She slowly but surely walks
out from behind the blinds. She was very anxious about standing naked
in front of the doctor she used to have a crush for. Her face burned
with embarrassment as she finally showed herself to Dr. Tofu.
&quot;Now, that wasn&#39;t so hard. Was it?&quot; &quot;(This is SO embarrassing!!)&quot;
&quot;Embarrassed Akane?&quot; Akane is surprised that he heard that.
&quot;You were never embarrassed when I worked on you before Akane.
Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m a full doctor now, you can trust me.&quot;

&quot;(gulp) I know I can trust you. It&#39;s just that no-one has ever
asked me strip naked before. (Unfortunately)&quot; &quot;Yea...I understand.
Well...the sooner we start the sooner we finish. Come over here
and I&#39;ll have a look at you.&quot; She slowly drifts over to him.
&quot;Just stand there, I&#39;ll look you over.&quot; Akane froze to the
spot as Dr. Tofu looked over her body. &quot;No dermal damage, good.
Any complaints?&quot; &quot;Well...Nabiki keeps stealing my bras and my
friends have turned into perverts and....&quot; &quot;I meant medical
complaints.&quot; &quot;Ohh...no.&quot; &quot;Ok then, let&#39;s check your heart.&quot;
Dr&#39; Tofu gets his stethoscope at puts it over Akane&#39;s left
breast. The cold feel of it put Akane on edge. &quot;Relax Akane,
this&#39;ll just take a second.&quot; He removes it and begins to
write on his notepad. &quot;Everything&#39;s ok there, heartbeat normal,
could you sit up on the table, I want to do some more tests.&quot;

--------

Little did they realise that someone was watching them from outside.
Shampoo, who was now tightly wrapped up in a raincoat was watching
the room from a bush near the side of the building. The darkness of
the evening hid her from view. She could see them through a large
window. &quot;Good, Akane and Doctor Man not see Shampoo.&quot; She looked
closer, and was pleasantly surprised by what she saw. &quot;Akane naked!!
Shampoo so lucky to see this!&quot; She produces a pair of binoculars from
her coat and takes a closer look. She couldn&#39;t help but be aroused when
she looked at Akane as she hopped up onto the examination table.
&quot;Hee! Hee! Akane is so cute! Ohh.....Shampoo want Akane bad!&quot;

---------

&quot;Hmm...I can&#39;t find anything wrong externally. I&#39;d better start that
blood work. Could you lie down on the table for me?&quot; She does this.
&quot;Good...I hope you don&#39;t mind needles Akane.&quot; &quot;They don&#39;t bother me.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s great, this shouldn&#39;t take too much longer now. Betty....
I&#39;d like 3 Type 5 syringes.&quot; &quot;[At once doctor!!]&quot; Akane began to giggle
again. &quot;Opps! Sorry Dr. Tofu.&quot; &quot;No, that&#39;s alright. At least your
relaxing now.&quot; Betty got the needles, but began to crash everywhere in
&#39;her&#39; attempt to give them to the doctor. &quot;Come on Betty! Get it
together!&quot; &quot;[At once doctor!!]&quot; &#39;She&#39; finally manages to give them
to Dr. Tofu. &quot;Finally, ok Akane, you&#39;ll feel a few pricks, little
more...&quot; He gently inserts a syringe into Akane&#39;s left arm and draws
some blood. He then does the same near her throat and somewhere near
her navel.

He puts the samples at computer terminal. &quot;Now we&#39;re going to see if
your father was right about your hormones...Betty, could you get me the
blood scanner?&quot; &quot;[At once doctor!]&quot; Betty gets the scanner, and hits
Dr. Tofu on the head with it. &quot;OWWW!! BETTY! Pull yourself together.&quot;
He punches Betty in the skull, damaging it. &quot;[Command Link Severed....
Returning to original programming.....CRUSH.....KILL.....DESTROY!!]&quot;
Betty began to strangle Dr. Tofu, while Akane watched on in surprise.
&quot;Help!! She&#39;s......KILLING ME!!&quot; In the blink on an eye, Akane sat up,
jumped off the table and kicked Betty&#39;s head off, disabling it.
Dr. Tofu slumped into the chair of his computer terminal, exhausted.
&quot;(gasp) (gasp) THOSE STUPID NERDS!! Why&#39;d they program her to do that?!
(gasp) (gasp) How can I thank you Akane?&quot; &quot;How about letting me put my
clothes back on?&quot; &quot;(gasp) Sure. (gasp) I&#39;m done checking you.&quot;

Akane goes behind the blinds and quickly puts her clothes back on.
Dr. Tofu regained his bearings and began to work on his computer.
&quot;Thanks to this new computerised blood scanner, I can check your
blood in a matter of seconds.&quot; &quot;Wow! Really?&quot; Said Akane with
half-genuine interest as she emerged from behind the blinds.
She sat down on the examination table as the doctor worked.
&quot;Ah...ha. Well...your in perfect health Akane. Your blood is
clear. Hmm....some evidence of higher than normal hormone levels,
maybe a few days ago. I can&#39;t be certain, but I think I might know
what made you attack Ranma so viciously.&quot;

&quot;What made me do it?&quot; &quot;Well...by the looks of things, you&#39;ve a more
powerful sex drive than most women. A very unique one actually.
Your generating hormones and love juices by the gallon, almost every
day. My guess is that all this has been building up in you for the
past few years, since your first period. You have becoming more edgy
and irritable as time past.&quot; &quot;HEY! Quit insulting me! If I had my
mallet here, you wouldn&#39;t be saying those things!!!&quot; &quot;See what I
mean? Now, picture this. Your body finally decides that it&#39;s waited
enough. It wants it&#39;s first mate. You happen to be with Ranma, and
were probably expecting to go all the way with him on Thursday night.
Am I right?&quot;

Akane blushed and looked to the ground. &quot;Well...yea....&quot;
&quot;But something goes wrong. Ranma does want to do it. Your instincts
tell you to use all of that pent up power....on him. Your beat him
worse than you ever have. Your primal instincts probably wanted you to
rape him afterward, but your mind prevented you from going any further.&quot;
Akane was shocked at this revelation, but not surprised. &quot;Yes.....
I was going to do that......but I couldn&#39;t. He was so....hurt, I&#39;ve
never seen him hurt that bad before. I called for help instead.
He needed a doctor. (sniff) Could...could I of killed him?&quot;

&quot;Well...no, not really. Most of his injuries were superficial. Right
now I&#39;ve got him on Codine and antibodies to help his body repair
itself. You simply don&#39;t have the strength to kill Ranma with blunt
weapons Akane.&quot; &quot;(sniff) Thank you....&quot; Dr. Tofu looks at the PC screen
closely. &quot;Still...I can&#39;t explain why the hormones are mostly gone now.&quot;
&quot;Huh? Didn&#39;t I use them up beating Ranma?&quot; &quot;Well no. You can&#39;t, your
type of hormone can only be spent when you have sex with someone.
Masturbation won&#39;t even get rid of that amount. Hmm, Ranma was too
beat up to have sex with you, and since I know you wouldn&#39;t do it with
anyone else, there must be another reason. This could be serious.
I&#39;m gonna book you a session at the Endocrinology Institute, they
might......&quot; &quot;Wait! Dr. Tofu, can I share something personal with you?
Something you can&#39;t tell anyone, especially my father!&quot;

&quot;Emm...Sure. Oh Akane.....You had sex didn&#39;t you?&quot; Akane nodded,
almost ashamed to admit what she had done. &quot;Well...I hope you
used protection.&quot; &quot;I didn&#39;t need to.&quot; &quot;WHAT? Of coarse you need to
Akane. Never have sex unprotected! You could get pregnant or contract
countless diseases! I can&#39;t believe you could be that reckless!&quot;
&quot;You don&#39;t understand.....I&#39;ve got a girlfriend now.&quot; &quot;Girlfriend?
Wow......do I know her?&quot; With a heartfulled sigh, Akane perpared
to tell him of the love of her life.&quot;It&#39;s Ukyo, I love her so much, I
lost my virginity to her.&quot; &quot;I see....well at least I&#39;m open minded
Akane. I&#39;m happy to see that you&#39;ve found love. Your father on the
other hand might be furious! If he learns that the wedding is off...&quot;

&quot;No.....the wedding is still on! Ukyo and I are going to marry him
together!! We both still love him so much!&quot; &quot;Is that even legal?&quot;
&quot;Uh huh! We checked the laws!&quot; &quot;Well, I suppose your father will
be pleased that your going to finally marry Ranma. Do I get an
invite to the wedding?&quot; &quot;There wouldn&#39;t be one without you! Emm...
Dr. Tofu? You know a lot about hormones don&#39;t you?&quot;
&quot;I majored on the Endocrine System. I was hoping to invent a way
to use hormones to make Kasumi fall in love with me....I didn&#39;t
get very far in that.&quot;

&quot;Then...I have a question.&quot; &quot;Ok...shoot.&quot; Akane swallowed her pride
and began to spill her heart to the doctor. &quot;Can....can hormones
make you fall in love with someone? Even people you never trusted,
or liked?&quot; &quot;I was hoping to find a link between hormones and love in
my research, but I didn&#39;t find one. Why do you ask?&quot; &quot;I (sniff) think
I&#39;m falling in love with...........Shampoo.&quot; &quot;SHAMPOO?! (Ehem) Why?&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ve been dreaming about her. In my dreams, she&#39;s always naked.
Always smiling at me. Sometimes, in the middle of the night....
I can hear her whispering softly in my ear. Saying my name, saying
she loves me. The most disturbing thing of it all is.....I find her
attractive. I would have sex with her. (sigh) But how could I ever
trust her? (sigh) It&#39;s all so weird. To make things worse, Ukyo
has started to think this way too. She&#39;s been fantasising about
her, and she thinks she&#39;s cute!&quot;

&quot;Well....I suppose there&#39;s nothing wrong with a healthy fantasy life.&quot;
&quot;Not for me! I keep seeing her, all over the place. I feel like she&#39;s
watching me. Even now.&quot; Dr. Tofu looks out the window and notices
movement in the bushes. &quot;What the?!&quot; &quot;What is it doctor?&quot; &quot;Oh...
nothing, the rain is making me see things outside. Why did I leave the
window blinds open anyway. No one should be able to see in here
during an exam, I value my patent&#39;s privacy.&quot; He quickly closes
the window blinds. Much to Shampoo&#39;s disgust outside. &quot;(AIYA!)&quot;
&quot;What was that noise? Ahh who cares?&quot;

&quot;(sigh) What do you think doctor? What&#39;s happening to me? Am I going
insane?&quot; &quot;Ohh...no. There&#39;s nothing wrong with any of that.
So your interested in that weird Chinese girl? So what! You still
love Ukyo and Ranma. Just let your heart decide what you want to
do next.&quot; &quot;Thanks doctor. You always know exactly what to say.&quot;

Outside in the waiting room, Soun was on edge, and was ripping the
magazines into tiny shreds, even the ones other people were still
reading. Before long, Akane is brought into this room by Dr. Tofu.
Soun jumps up, quickly runs over to Akane and hugs her tightly,
surprising her. &quot;Oh Akane! Are you alright? Doctor? What&#39;s the
prognosis?&quot; &quot;Well...I couldn&#39;t find the problem......&quot; &quot;YOU COUNDN&#39;T
FIND IT?!!! OH NO!! She&#39;s going to die isn&#39;t she?!&quot; Soun begins to
cry on Akane&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Oh Akane!! I never thought I&#39;d have to
arrange your funeral!! Oh, this is so HEARTBREAKING!!&quot;

&quot;(Ahem) Mr. Tendo?&quot; Soun beings to pound the wall with his fist.
&quot;IT&#39;S NOT FAIR! LET HER LIVE! TAKE ME! TAKE ME INSTEAD YOU BASTARDS!!&quot;
&quot;MR. TENDO!! With all due respect, GET A GRIP! (Ahem) Akane is in
better health than I am. I suspect that it was just stress that
caused her to do what she did. It happens to the best of us.&quot;
&quot;Oh....(phew) You got me worried there! Well that&#39;s great news!
How about we celebrate Akane? Get a big meal or something?&quot;
&quot;Wow...that sounds great!&quot; &quot;Come on let&#39;s go home and do that!&quot;
They were about to leave when Dr. Tofu stopped them. &quot;Forgetting
something Mr. Tendo?&quot; &quot;What? Oh yes..&quot; Both of them bowed in front
of Tofu. &quot;Thank you so much for treating my daughter.&quot;

&quot;No, not that....THIS!&quot; Tofu produces a bill in front of Soun&#39;s
bowed face. Soun recoils in horror when he saw the total.
&quot;What is this?!&quot; &quot;It&#39;s the cost of that exam, and treating Ranma
last Thursday.&quot; &quot;But you said not to worry about the cost!&quot;
&quot;I only said that because you were too busy panicking over Ranma,
afraid that Akane had killed him.&quot; Soun looked at the cost again.
&quot;Why so expensive?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m a full doctor now! I&#39;m naturally more
expensive.&quot; Said Dr. Tofu proudly as he held the lapels
of his doctor&#39;s coat with pride.&quot;

Soun examined the bill closly. &quot;Hmm....divide by 3, carry the
2...that makes........RUN AKANE!!!&quot; Soun darts out the door and
down the street. Akane and Tofu look on, dumdfounded. &quot;I can&#39;t
believe he just left you behind Akane.&quot; &quot;I can, especially when
there&#39;s a bill involved. (sigh) You&#39;d think that maybe he would
show you some gratitude for helping Ranma.&quot; &quot;Well...at least
he left the umbrella behind for you. Here, take this.&quot;
Dr. Tofu hands Akane the bill. Akane looks at it for a second
before she began rummaging in her purse.

&quot;Emm...I&#39;ve only got 400 Yen on me Dr. Tofu, I don&#39;t have
enough to pay for my exam.&quot; &quot;Oh Akane...put your money
away. I&#39;d never expect you to foot the bill. I&#39;d like you
to take that invoice to your father. He has to pay me sooner
or later.&quot; &quot;Hee! Hee! Ok!&quot; &quot;Ohh and Akane. (Best of luck with
Ukyo).&quot; Akane was plesantly surprised by this, reassuring her
view of Dr.Tofu as a really nice guy. &quot;Thank you Dr. Tofu!
That means a lot coning from you! Good bye Dr. Tofu! I hope
I&#39;ll see you agian soon.&quot; &quot;Look after yourself Akane.&quot;
Akane gets the umbrella and leaves the clinic.

She stands out in the porch for a minute, to wait for the rain to
die down a little. As the rain began to clear, Akane unfolded the
umbrella and began to walk away from the clinic, only to be stopped
by the feeling that she was being watched. She quickly turned
around and saw a girl across the street, wrapped tightly in a
raincoat. Akane instantly recognised who it was. &quot;(Shampoo?!)&quot;
Shampoo suddenly noticed that Akane had spotted her, and quickly
ran down the street, and out of sight.

&quot;(SO! It was you following me after all! She must be up to
something. I&#39;ll have to be careful....)&quot; Akane continued home.

---------------------------------

Unfortunately for Akane, this was only the beginning of her ordeal.
The next few days saw her every move being watched by the young
Amazon. Every time she trained in the dojo, Shampoo was watching.
Every time she went to Furinkan High, Shampoo was watching.
Every time she showered, or took her clothes off, Shampoo was
watching, somewhere. Akane was too afraid to show anymore affection
towards her girlfriend, now that Shampoo was watching her. This
ripped Akane to pieces inside, and then one day, she had enough.
She had to see Ukyo...

-----------

Akane peered out the open door of the dojo. She knew the Amazon
was out there somewhere, but where? Akane took her mark like
an Olympic runner. &quot;Ok Akane. This is for the gold, and Ukyo.&quot;
Almost imagining the sound of a gunfire, Akane shot off down the
street. She was making good speed down main street, but her
progress was tainted by the sound of a bicycle chain, nearby.
She quickly duck into an alley. The bicycle appeared to be
getting closer as she caught her breath.

She peered out of the alley, only to see the Cat Cafe&#39;s
delivery bike moving along the rooftops across the street.
It stopped just short of the building parallel to where Akane
was. Akane quickly hid herself again when she realised that
it&#39;s rider was watching her, waiting for her next move.
&quot;(Damn it! So close to Ukyo! I can&#39;t let her see me go into
Ucchan&#39;s. But I can&#39;t lose her if she&#39;s on that bike!)&quot;
She looks down the alley, and saw that the other end was near
the park. &quot;(I wonder, maybe I can lose her in the park?)&quot;

Akane ran down the alley. That alley had wooden fences on both
sides of it, and seconds later, she heard the sound of a bicycle
running along the one on the left. Akane quickly spun around and
perpared to fight. But there was no one there. Shampoo was close,
so close that Akane could almost feel it. She made a dash for
the park and it&#39;s many trees, ran as far inside it as she could,
and hid behind the largest tree there. &quot;(This should give me a
few minutes to plan my next move.)&quot;

No sooner had she said that, when she heard a loud noise from
inside a nearby tree. Something large had landed on it. It was
obvious to Akane, as she saw the rain of leaves from the tree,
that Shampoo had jumped onto it with her bike. Then the same
happened to a tree closer to Akane, and then another.
Shampoo was getting closer. Akane had only a few seconds to plan
her next move. She looked around, to see if she could find
something to help her, and then she noticed the small lake in the
middle of the park. &quot;(Water! Of coarse! But how to get her into
it?)&quot; She looked at anything near the water&#39;s edge and saw a
fairly dead looking tree beside the lake. An evil smile grew on
Akane&#39;s face. &quot;(....perfect!)&quot;

Akane made a run for the dead tree as Shampoo landed in the tree
next to her. A took a few seconds, but Akane managed to get under
that dead tree. &quot;(I&#39;m here Shampoo...come and get me!)&quot; The air
was tense for a few seconds. It was quiet, too quiet. But then
it came. A large noise could be heard overhead. Akane looked
up at the rain of dead leaves that began to fall on her.
Shampoo was on the dead tree. Akane crossed her arms and waited,
but she didn&#39;t have to wait long. She heard a cracking noise as
one of the branches gave way to the combined weight of Shampoo
and her bike. &quot;AIYAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!&quot;

The bike and it&#39;s rider fell into the lake with an explosion
of freezing cold water. &quot;(That&#39;ll keep you off my back for a few
hours.....and now I can go to my beloved Ukyo.)&quot;

----------------------

Akane ran as fast as her legs could carry her. She had been away
from Ukyo for far too long. She burst in Ucchan&#39;s, which had a few
customers inside, and spotted Ukyo at the counter. &quot;UKYO!!!&quot;
Yelled Akane as she burst into tears. &quot;Akane!&quot; A shocked Ukyo downed
tools and perpared to see to her distraught girlfriend. &quot;Konatsu,
take over here.&quot; &quot;At once Ukyo!&quot; &quot;Akane, come with me to the back
room.&quot;

Akane hurried with Ukyo to a room behind the restaurant.
As soon as they were out of sight Akane tightly wrapped her arms
around her lover. &quot;Ohh Ukyo! (sniff) I missed you so much!&quot;
&quot;(Shh...It&#39;s ok now. I&#39;m here.)&quot; Whispered Ukyo softly as she gently
stroked Akane&#39;s head. They looked at each other for a few seconds,
before diving into the deepest kiss they had ever had. Their soft
lips held onto each other. As soft as they were, they still had the
strenght to hold on, no matter what and Akane&#39;s lips held on for dear
life. She didn&#39;t want to leave Ukyo ever again. Ukyo felt the same,
holding on with the same passion and strenght. She had missed her
Akane so much as well, and she didn&#39;t want to let go, ever.
But all good things come to an end, and so did their kiss. Their
lips gently parted as Akane prepared to speak.

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry for not coming sooner I.....&quot; &quot;It&#39;s ok I understand.
You were frightened someone would find out about us weren&#39;t you?&quot;
&quot;How? How did you know?&quot;  &quot;I&#39;m beginning to know you better than you
know yourself. I saw the way you &#39;weren&#39;t&#39; looking at me in class.
You were trying so hard to ignore me. I knew something was troubling
you. Please...tell me what&#39;s wrong.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s (sniff) it&#39;s Shampoo!!
She&#39;s been following me, night and day, ALWAYS watching me, stalking
me.&quot; An expression of relief suddenly engulfed Ukyo&#39;s face.
&quot;And there was me thinking I was going mad! I&#39;ve been seeing her too.
She&#39;s been watching Ucchan&#39;s regularly for the past few days.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s been spying on you too?&quot; &quot;Yep! It was kind of exciting having
that Amazon stalking me. She&#39;s so cute in her own way.&quot;
&quot;What?! Ukyo, what&#39;s gotten into you? You used to hate her as much
as me!&quot; &quot;Yea, but that was before. You&#39;ve gotta admit. That cute little
Amazon does actually have a nice side to her. We&#39;ve both seen it.
And if you ignore all the bad things about her, she&#39;s....not half bad
at all.&quot; &quot;I can&#39;t believe your saying those things Ukyo.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t? But Akane...haven&#39;t you been feeling the same things as
me. Hearing her in your sleep, seeing her body, sensing her touch.&quot;
&quot;Well.......All right.......I have been thinking about her.....
and....(gulp) I can&#39;t believe I saying this.....I&#39;m sort of starting
to have a crush on her.&quot; Ukyo gasped outloud in joyful surprise.
&quot;That&#39;s great! So am I! I love a lot of things about her. Her body,
the cute way she talks like a 5 year old, her martial arts skills,
her clever use of formulas......&quot; They both look at each other as
they made a shocking realisation. They both yelled at the same time.
&quot;FORMULAS?!!&quot;

Akane pounds the wall in anger. &quot;I should have know!! One of her
damned formulas! How could I be so blind?!&quot; &quot;What does this mean?
Is everything that&#39;s happened so far the result of some Shampoo
Formula? Even our love?&quot; Surprised at what she had just said Akane
looks at Ukyo, who&#39;s eyes were starting to fill with tears.
&quot;What do you mean Ukyo?&quot; &quot;I mean (sniff) the dreams, our love,
our love for Shampoo, it was all (sniff) planned by her.&quot;
&quot;But....Ukyo! I love you! That&#39;ll never change!&quot; Akane goes over
to Ukyo and hugs her tightly. &quot;I&#39;m not going to stop loving you
just because it&#39;s part of that damn Amazon&#39;s plan.&quot;
&quot;(sniff) I love you Akane.&quot; Ukyo planted a soft kiss on the
lips of her lover as a thank you for what she had just said an
done. This just proved to Ukyo, that Akane was a source of strenght
for her now.

&quot;Now...what could she be planning?&quot; Akane pondered about this for
a few seconds before she made a shocking realisation. &quot;Why didn&#39;t I
see it?! Ranma!!!&quot; &quot;Ranchan?&quot; &quot;Yes Ukyo, Ranma! We&#39;ve been ignoring
him all this time! She must want us distracted, while she moves in
and takes our Ranma!&quot; &quot;Sugar, you might be right. But we can&#39;t
start jumping the gun here! We need to be sure about what she&#39;s
really up to.&quot; &quot;Yes, we need to know what she&#39;s doing...hmm...
I&#39;ve got an idea!&quot; Akane leans forward and whispers something
into Ukyo&#39;s ear. &quot;Sugar? That&#39;s illegal!&quot; &quot;So is stalking.
She&#39;s gotta pay for what she&#39;s doing to us!&quot; &quot;Well...ok...
just don&#39;t hurt her too bad.&quot; &quot;Sure...whatever you say...&quot;

----------------------

A few hours later, Shampoo had recovered from the body-changing
effects of her swim in the cold lake water, and was hiding in an
alley outside Ucchan&#39;s. She patiently watched the front of the
restaurant, for any movement. She didn&#39;t have to wait too long.
Much to her surprise and delight, she spotted both of the girls
she loved leave Ucchan&#39;s together, hand-in-hand. &quot;Girls holding
hands?! This so cute! Maybe...maybe now Shampoo should talk,
and declare love? Well...here Shampoo goes!&quot;

Shampoo emerged from the alley and began to follow the girls
closely. &quot;(Remember Shampoo...speak from heart, heart never
lies...)&quot; She got closer to them with every stride. This
was it. Shampoo&#39;s time of reckoning. If she played her cards
right, she&#39;d have two girlfriends by the end of the day.
Or so the thought... Akane and Ukyo knew well that Shampoo was
right behind them. They looked at each other, almost to
signal one another about something.

And then they acted. They quickly went into an alleyway.
Shampoo followed them in, but the alley was empty. &quot;(Huh where
did girls go?)&quot; Shampoo went deeper in. &quot;Where did girls go?
This confuse Shampoo.&quot; &quot;Not as much as you&#39;ve confused us.&quot;
Came Ukyo&#39;s voice from somewhere. &quot;(Huh? Ukyo?)&quot; Just then
Ukyo appeared from nowhere, blocking Shampoo from walking
further into the alley, armed with her large spatula.

&quot;Your formula fuelled madness ends here Amazon Girl!!&quot;
Came Akane&#39;s voice from behind her. Shampoo turned around
only to see Akane blocking the exit of the alley, armed with
her mallet. Shampoo was shocked bt all this, and despritly
tried to plead with them in her broken Japanese.
&quot;Girls not understand! Shampoo no use formula.&quot;
&quot;Enough of your lies! Do it Uyko!!!&quot; Shampoo turned to face
Ukyo, just long enough to see her hit her with the spatula.
This sent her flying in the direction of Akane, who was ready
with her mallet. Shampoo received a swift blow to the head
which sent her to the ground. Shampoo had been knocked out-cold.
She blacked-out...

---------------------------------------

Shampoo was kind of groggy as she began to wake. She had a pounding
head-ache and couldn&#39;t open her eyes yet, or move. She could feel
that her arms were in a very unnatural position. They were behind
her back. As her feeling returned, she could feel rope bound around
her wrists. She could feel that she was sitting down on a chair.
Her arms were tied behind her back, and her ankles and been tied to
the chair legs. She tried to cry out for help, but couldn&#39;t.
She had also been gagged.

Her vision returned. It was dark, probably night time. She was in
a familiar bedroom, it was Ukyo&#39;s. The smell of okonomiyaki from
downstairs made it obvious of where she was. Her headache began
to dissolve, and she could focus again. She began to struggle with
her binds in a vain attempt to escape. She tried every trick she
had been taught to get out of these kind of situations, but it
was no good. Whoever had tied her up, knew exactly what they were
doing.

Then without any warning, Akane entered the room, dressed only in her
nightshirt. Shampoo was delighted to see Akane, so scantly clad, but
was still on edge, it was clear to her now that her captors were the
very girls she loved. Akane didn&#39;t seem to notice the awake Shampoo
at first. She just yawned as she came in, and began to walk towards
Ukyo&#39;s bed. But then, in the corner of her eye, she saw that her
prisoner was awake, and gave Shampoo a cold look as she yelled out.

&quot;UKYO! SHE&#39;S AWAKE!!&quot; Akane began to advance towards Shampoo who
looked at her beloved captor with frightened eyes. Ukyo quickly
made her way into the bedroom and went towards Shampoo when she
saw Akane approaching her. She was also wearing her nightshirt.
Shampoo tried to plead with them, but only mewing noises escaped
the gag. &quot;Akane, I don&#39;t think we need to keep her gagged anymore.&quot;
&quot;But Ukyo!&quot; &quot;Akane, I only gagged her for the sake of the customers.&quot;
Ukyo leaned forward and untied Shampoo&#39;s gag.

Both girls sat down on the bed and looked at Shampoo with crossed
arms. &quot;Ok Shampoo, talk! Akane and myself want to know what you&#39;re
up to!&quot; Shampoo couldn&#39;t talk, she was too embarrassed. She had
suffered the dishonour of capture, but what really caught her
tongue was being so close to the near-naked girls of her dreams.
She wanted to tell them how she felt, so much. But she couldn&#39;t,
she simply couldn&#39;t, and it broke her up inside. The girls were
getting impatient with her, especially Akane.

&quot;Damn it Shampoo!! Spill it!!! Why were you following us all week?!&quot;
&quot;Sh...Sh...Shampoo can&#39;t tell....&quot; Ukyo looked at Shampoo with
increased interest. &quot;Shampoo....what do you mean? Why can&#39;t you
tell us?&quot; Shampoo said nothing, she just looked to ground embarrassed.
&quot;Shampoo!! Ukyo asked you a question! ANSWER IT!!&quot; &quot;Shampoo can&#39;t!!
Just....can&#39;t! Please....(sniff)...untie Shampoo....&quot; They looked at
her in surprise as she began to sob. This was very unusual behaviour
for Shampoo, it was almost like she had surrendered to the girls.
Little did they know, it was because she loved them.

Ukyo was beginning to get concerned about Shampoo, so she began to
talk softer. &quot;Shampoo......why are you making us fall in love with
each other? Is it part of a plan to steal Ranma from us?&quot;
Shampoo stopped crying and looked at them with surprise. &quot;Love with
each other? Shampoo not understand.&quot; &quot;Well, you see....&quot;
&quot;Ukyo! Don&#39;t tell her!&quot; &quot;She has a right to know Akane. Shampoo...
Myself and Akane, we&#39;re lovers.&quot; Shampoo&#39;s heart jumped, all her
wildest dreams, had come true. The girls she loved, loved each other.
She didn&#39;t have to choose, she could love both equally. But she
couldn&#39;t tell them how she felt. She was certain that they hated her
now. This broke her heart, she was so close to having them, but
it seemed so...impossible.

&quot;(sniff) Shampoo not cause love between girls. Shampoo not know
how! Please! (sniff) Untie Shampoo!&quot; Akane put her foot down.
&quot;NO! Your staying tied up until we get answers!&quot;
&quot;(sniff) Girls can&#39;t keep me here! Cologne get worried! Cologne come
and rescue Shampoo!&quot; &quot;Well sugar, that might of been true.
Unfortunately for you, for some reason, which we still can&#39;t explain,
she rang here looking for you. We told her that you were staying the
night, and she was very happy to hear that for some reason. So....
It looks like we can safely hold you prisoner for tonight, and most
of tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;So Shampoo, the sooner you talk, the sooner we let you go. Or else
we&#39;ll keep you tied up here far as long as we can!!!&quot; Any hope
inside Shampoo of rescue seemed to dissolve in that second. If Cologne
believed Ukyo, she&#39;d assume that her great granddaughter had succeeded
to win the girl&#39;s hearts, and would never dream of disturbing her, even
if she was gone for days. The only other person who might save her,
was...Mousse, and she didn&#39;t want to think about that.

While Shampoo thought about all this the girls just watched her.
Akane believed her silence was really a show of defiance, Ukyo wasn&#39;t
so sure. It was going to be a long night of interrogations.

------------

Later that night. Akane was so near to pulling her hair out with
frustration as she quizzed Shampoo. She paced around the Amazon as
she asked her questions. &quot;Grrrr!!! ANSWER!!!! Why were you stalking me!!
And don&#39;t deny it!! I saw you fall out of that tree!!&quot; Again, Akane was
met by silence from Shampoo. &quot;ARGGGG!!! THIS IS SO HARD!!&quot;
&quot;(yawn) Akane...(yawn) Sugar, it&#39;s 3AM. I&#39;m tired from working all day.
Let&#39;s go to bed.&quot; Akane turns to Ukyo who was still sitting on the
bed.

&quot;Ohh...Ok. Hee! Hee! I&#39;ve been looking forward to this all week.&quot;
Akane quickly slips off her nightshirt and stood naked between the two
girls. Shampoo looked at her with quiet astonishment and delight.
Ukyo was also pleased to see her girlfriend like this. &quot;Hee! Hee! What
are you up to sugar?&quot; &quot;Well...it is the weekend, and I&#39;m in the mood for
it...&quot; Ukyo stood up. &quot;Wait a minute. You want to have sex with me NOW?!
In front of Shampoo?!&quot; Shampoo tried her hardest not to grin, as the idea
of seeing them together, excited her inside. &quot;Well....yea. It&#39;ll serve her
right for spying on us. Forcing her to watch us make love, will make her
really uncomfortable! Besides...&quot; Akane seductively walks up to Ukyo.
&quot;...being watched is supposed to be a turn on.&quot;

Ukyo looked upon her girlfriend in exausted disbelief.
&quot;Akane! You know well how shy I am about this kind of thing! I&#39;m
not stripping in front of her, and I&#39;m definitely not having sex near
her either. I&#39;m so tired after a long week Akane. I just want to fall
asleep with you in my arms.&quot; &quot;But.....(sigh) I&#39;m being selfish again
aren&#39;t I? I shouldn&#39;t force you. Ok...Let&#39;s sleep together, but I
stay naked! Ok? I just love when you touch my body.&quot; &quot;(sigh) That&#39;s
fine with me, I do love to touch you.&quot; &quot;Hee! Hee! Great! It&#39;s not
sex but it&#39;s the next best thing!&quot;

With a sigh of relief, Ukyo scratched her forehead.
&quot;Good, we can always question Shampoo in the morning.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll have to.&quot; &quot;What do you mean sugar?&quot; &quot;Well,
I bet it&#39;s been a while since you went to the bathroom Shampoo.
Am I right?&quot; Shampoo looked at Akane, shocked at what she was suggesting.
&quot;What are you suggesting Akane?&quot; &quot;I suggest we let her bladder do all
the interrogating for us! You can&#39;t keep it in forever Shampoo!
And I bet that Amazon sense of pride of yours forbids you from doing
something as dishonourable as peeing yourself in captivity.&quot;
Shampoo couldn&#39;t believe what Akane had just said.
&quot;AKANE! I&#39;m surprised with you! How could you be that cruel?!&quot;

Akane whispers into her lover&#39;s ear. &quot;(Don&#39;t worry she&#39;ll crack. For
some reason she isn&#39;t as strong as she usually is.)&quot; &quot;(Have you
forgotten that we have a crush on that girl? I&#39;m beginning to feel
sorry for her.)&quot; &quot;(But Ukyo I...OK, I know what your thinking,
but this instead of me beating it out of her, this is as gentle
as I get in situations like this. This way I won&#39;t hurt her.)&quot;
&quot;(sigh) (I understand. Go on, get in bed, I&#39;ll check on her binds.)&quot;

Akane lay down into Ukyo&#39;s bed as Ukyo went over to check on Shampoo.
She tugged to the ropes to see if they were holding, and as she did
this she leaned towards Shampoo&#39;s ear and began to whisper to her.
&quot;(If you behave tonight, I&#39;ll bring you to the bathroom when I
wake up.)&quot; A small smile grew on Shampoo&#39;s face. This sudden
gesture of kindness from Ukyo lifted Shampoo&#39;s heart. Ukyo also
smiled back, before she left her and went towards the bed and her
lover.

She switched off the light, and lay over Akane in the bed, then
wrapped both of them in the bedcover. Shampoo watched them longingly
as they cuddled, kissed, and finally, fell asleep in each other&#39;s
arms. She sat quietly in the darkness. This kind of reminded her of
her dream of the girls. Memories of that dream kept her going.
She looked at them, so happy in each other&#39;s arms. This scene brought
a tear to her eye, it was the most beautiful thing she had ever
seen. If only she could untie herself, and join them. She wanted
that so much. She didn&#39;t sleep that night, she couldn&#39;t.

Just seeing them like this, was incentive enough to keep her eyes
open. Also, she couldn&#39;t really sleep anyway as the pain of a full
bladder began to set in. Akane was right, she was far too proud let
go of herself, especially now. She had to keep it in. At least she
had something cute to look at, as she waited for morning.

----------------

Dawn. Ukyo began to ease her eyes open, and slowly woke. She was
woken by Akane&#39;s breathing, which lifted her hair every few seconds.
Gently, she picked herself up and got to her feet, all the time being
careful not to wake her. She stretched and looked out the window
to the twilight of early morning. The grip of night still held the
streets of Nerima. Soon her gaze turned to the young Amazon, who
was half awake, and too concerned with the troubles of her own body
to notice Ukyo&#39;s awakening.

Ukyo when over to Shampoo and playfully blew on her ear, immediately
catching the girl&#39;s attention. She smiled as she spoke.&quot;(Well Shampoo,
you stayed quiet all night, and your as dry as a bone. It looks like
I owe you a trip to the bathroom.)&quot; Shampoo lit up with as much joy as
she possibly could, while she was in pain. Ukyo quickly untied Shampoo&#39;s
ankles, but left her arms tied as she helped the girl to her feet. Shampoo
was helped by Ukyo into her en-suite bathroom, since she couldn&#39;t walk
properly from the pain of sitting on that wooden chair for so many
hours.

Ukyo placed her in front of the toilet, facing away from it.
&quot;Emm....hmm...I&#39;ve never helped anyone take a pee before so, I&#39;m not
sure what to do.&quot; &quot;Untie Shampoo maybe?&quot; &quot;Untie you? I&#39;m sorry
Shampoo I can&#39;t do that, you&#39;ll escape. I&#39;ll...emm...have to pull your
underwear down  for you. (gulp) Please stand still.&quot; Shampoo
watched Ukyo with quiet anticipation as her skirt was lifted by her.
With the precision of a surgeon, Ukyo got hold of the elastic of
Shampoo&#39;s panties, and pulled it down as fast as she could.
She stood back.

&quot;Well, that wasn&#39;t as hard as I though it would be. Ok, Shampoo
sit down and do what you need to.&quot; Shampoo sat and let out massive
sigh of relief as she relieved herself. &quot;I could tell you needed that.
(sigh) What was Akane thinking of, forcing you to keep it in?
It was bad enough that I tied you up, but I couldn&#39;t torture you....&quot;
&quot;(Thank you Ukyo)&quot; Ukyo looked at her with surprise. &quot;You just called
me Ukyo. You never call me by my name.&quot; &quot;Shampoo call you by real
name now. Sorry for calling you Spatula Girl for so long.&quot;

Ukyo was speechless, Shampoo had just apologised to her. Those feelings
of love she had for her were slowly starting to return to Ukyo.
She could only smile as she saw Shampoo&#39;s mood improve from the relief of
an empty bladder. &quot;Don&#39;t...mention it. It&#39;s ok........sugar.&quot;

This tranquil moment of bonding in the bathroom could have lasted longer,
unfortunately the Great Kitchen Destroyer herself had woken, and needed
the toilet. She jumped to her feet and slid open the bathroom door.
She was about to head for the toilet when she saw, much to her surprise
and disgust, Shampoo sitting on it with Ukyo standing near by.
&quot;What the?! Why is Shampoo on the toilet!&quot; &quot;And a good morning to
you too sugar.&quot; &quot;(sigh) Good morning. Now, why is Shampoo on the
toilet?&quot; &quot;Well, a good reason would be that she needed to pee.&quot;
&quot;But...my plan....&quot; &quot;Akane, I&#39;m not going to torture her! And I&#39;m not
going to let you do it either.&quot;

Akane grabbed her own groin and began to do a little dance on the spot.
&quot;But I need to pee right now!&quot; &quot;Well.....Shampoo&#39;s using this one
right now. There&#39;s another toilet downstairs in the restaurant, use that
one, sugar.&quot; &quot;Ohhhhh, fine!&quot; Akane darts out of the room, still naked.
&quot;Perhaps I should have warned her that Konatsu uses that one? Oh well.&quot;
Shampoo begins to giggle upon hearing that. Ukyo was a little amused by
this herself.

Konatsu was already in the restaurant. He yawned as he slowly approached
the toilet door. He was about to open it when heard someone running from
behind him. Suddenly a naked Akane blocks his path into the bathroom.
She hopped on the spot, with her hands holding her groin as she spoke.
&quot;Konatsu! You gotta let me go in first! PLEASE!! You gotta say yes!!&quot;
He just stood there, almost petrified by what he saw in front of him.
He made a slight nodding motion with his head, it was the most movement
that he could do. &quot;OH THANK YOU KONATSU!!&quot; She darted into the bathroom,
leaving Konatsu looking like a human statue, frozen solid from the
shock of seeing Akane naked.

Shampoo had finished in the bathroom and Ukyo had brought her back
into the bedroom, and was tying her ankles to the chair again.
&quot;I&#39;m very surprised with you Shampoo, your being very placid right now.
I would of expected you to attempt an escape when I brought you to
the toilet...&quot; Just then Ukyo caught something in the corner of her eye.
She saw that Shampoo was blushing as she finished tying the knot around
her ankle. She stood up and examined her expression, hoping that it
was only embarrassment. But then she looked down at Shampoo&#39;s breasts
and saw two little bulges on them. Then it all came together for Ukyo.

&quot;Erect nipples? Oh no. You like that don&#39;t you? You like me tying you
up.&quot; Shampoo blushed even more, trying her hardest not to grin.
Ukyo stepped back and lay up against the wall, her head swimming with
ideas about what her captive was thinking. &quot;Ok Shampoo, one last time.
Why were you following me this week?&quot; At first she didn&#39;t say anything,
but then she cleared her throat and prepared to finally say it...
&quot;(gulp) Shampoo follow Ukyo because....(sigh) Shampoo dream about Ukyo
and..........(gulp) Shampoo.......Shampoo love......Sh...Sh...Sham...
(sniff) Sh...Shampoo love......(Shampoo loves you).&quot;

Ukyo&#39;s heart jumped for a second when she heard this, and looked into
Shampoo&#39;s tear-soaked eyes as she spoke. &quot;Oh Shampoo...you love me?
Ohh...why didn&#39;t you say so?&quot; She looked upon the young Amazon with the
affection of a lover, before speaking again. &quot;I don&#39;t think we need to
keep you tied up any more.&quot; Ukyo quickly released Shampoo from her binds
and helped her to her feet. &quot;Now, feel better?&quot; &quot;Shampoo know only one
way to thank Ukyo!&quot; &quot;Huh?&quot; Shampoo got hold of Ukyo&#39;s shoulders and
pinned her to the wall. &quot;HEY! What do you think you&#39;re....&quot;

Her sentence was cut short by Shampoo&#39;s mouth. With no warning,
Shampoo had locked her soft lips with Ukyo&#39;s. Ukyo struggled with all
her might to escape Shampoo&#39;s grip of love, but her kiss was irresistible,
it sapped all of Ukyo&#39;s will to escape. Those lips were so soft, just as
soft as Akane&#39;s, maybe even softer. But this time she was even more
surprised. She expected her to be harder, less gentle than her beloved
Akane. This was too much for her. Soon she surrendered to the beautiful
young Amazon, and let her mouth be invaded by her soft, yet powerful, 
tongue.
As the insides of her mouth were being lovingly massaged by Shampoo, the
barriers inside of Ukyo began to fall. She was falling deeper in love with
Shampoo, and she didn&#39;t have the will to fight it anymore, not while she
received the most sensual kiss of her life.

Shampoo explored her mouth with unusual talent. She seemed to know
exactly how to make Ukyo feel good, with a single touch of her
tongue. Soon she let go, and smiled at Ukyo in a new and very familiar
way. Just like in the wedding dream, Shampoo looked at Ukyo with very
loving eyes. &quot;Shampoo...&quot; Again she was cut short by Shampoo&#39;s mouth.
This time she kissed Ukyo very slowly, but in a disturbingly familiar
way. She completed the kiss and took a step back from a shocked Ukyo,
and smiled at her with genuine feelings of happiness for what she
had just done the girl she loved.

&quot;THE KISS OF DEATH?!&quot; Said Ukyo in disbelief when she realised what
Shampoo had done to her. &quot;WHY?! What did I do to deserve that?
Why do you want to kill me?&quot; Shampoo cleared her throat before
saying what she had to say. She had waited a long time for this,
and wanted to get it right the first time. &quot;Ukyo not understand. If
Shampoo gives kiss of death to girl she loves, it becomes a kiss of
marriage!&quot; &quot;Kiss of Marriage? You want to....Awww...You want to marry me?&quot;
Said Ukyo as she began to get choked up with tears of emotion.
This cute little Amazon loved her so much that she wanted to marry her.
Never before had Ukyo felt so loved.

&quot;Shampoo loves you so much...Shampoo also loves Akane and Ranma.
Shampoo knows you love them too. Shampoo (sniff) never want to
leave you. Shampoo want us all to be together....forever.
All Shampoo can say is, sorry for all the bad things done, and
hope Ukyo will forgive. Then even if Ukyo not want to marry Shampoo,
it ok.&quot; Ukyo wasn&#39;t sure what to say to this, her feelings were so
strong now, she couldn&#39;t put them into words. &quot;Ohh, Shampoo. (sniff)
No-one has ever proposed to me before...(sniff) I&#39;m so confused now.
I only really started getting interested in girls a few days ago,
and since then, I&#39;ve...been thinking about you...ohh, your so cute!&quot;
Shampoo was overjoyed to hear that.

&quot;But...my feelings...they&#39;re I....I don&#39;t know what to say...&quot;
&quot;Shh....Ukyo....Words not good enough....Say with a kiss.&quot;
Shampoo extended her arms out to receive Ukyo, who looked at her for
a second, and then decided to go ahead. She walked into Shampoo&#39;s
embrace, certain that she would kissing her in seconds. They embraced
and closed their eyes as they began to kiss passionately. As their
delicate lips caressed each other, Ukyo could almost feel their souls
come in contact. At that second, from the kiss, she could tell that
Shampoo&#39;s feelings for her were truly genuine. After that it was only
a matter of time....from that kiss, Ukyo fell in love with Shampoo.

----------------

Akane had finished with the bathroom and stepped out into the restaurant.
She stretched and yawned as she prepared to speak. &quot;Ahh...I needed that!&quot;
Just then she noticed Konatsu, still frozen to the spot. &quot;Hmm...this
doesn&#39;t look good.&quot; She walked up him and waved her hand in front of
his face. &quot;Hello! Konatsu? Anybody in there?&quot; Suddenly, he came back to
life. He took one look at Akane&#39;s naked body, and recoiled in
embarrassment. &quot;You&#39;re n....n...n..nake....nake....&quot; &quot;Huh?&quot; Akane looks
down at her body. &quot;What? Haven&#39;t you seen a naked girl before?&quot;
He shook his head nervously. &quot;Hee! Hee! Relax Konatsu! Your a nice guy,
I don&#39;t mind you seeing me this way!&quot; He began to relax a little.
It seemed that permission was all the ninja needed to be able to see
her naked. He was still on edge though, he wasn&#39;t used to seeing good-
looking girls like Akane.

&quot;Now, that&#39;s better! Hmm...I&#39;m surprised. You&#39;ve lived with Ukyo for
some time now. I would have expected you to have seen her naked at least
once.&quot; &quot;No, Ukyo&#39;s shy about that. I&#39;ve only seen her in underwear.&quot;
He let out a disheartened sigh, sure in knowledge that he would never
have her, or indeed, see he naked. Akane couldn&#39;t help but be moved.
&quot;Aww...Konatsu. You really love her, don&#39;t you?&quot; He nodded his head as
he looked at the ground in despair. &quot;Well then! That&#39;s something we&#39;ve
got in common!&quot; &quot;Huh?&quot;

Konatsu looked at Akane with surprise as she wrapped her arms around him.
&quot;We&#39;re gonna be the best of friends Konatsu! Just you wait!&quot; Konatsu was
slightly embarresed, but none the less happy to gain Akane as a friend,
it was just what self-esteem really needed. &quot;T...Thank you Akane. I would
like to count you as a friend.&quot; &quot;Hey Buddy! We already are friends! Oh...
and just you wait! Ukyo and I are gonna make you happy again!&quot;
&quot;Huh? What are you talking about?&quot;  &quot;Hee! Hee! I&#39;ve said too much already!
Now, I&#39;ve gotta go and take care of something upstairs. See ya buddy!&quot;

Akane released Konatsu and cheerfully skipped towards the stairwell.
He watched her leave with quiet amazement. She wasn&#39;t Ukyo, or even a
potential girlfriend, but Akane&#39;s friendship, kind of made him feel
better. At least now he sort of had something in common with Ukyo.

Akane made it to the closed doorway of Ukyo&#39;s bedroom.
&quot;Alright, back to business Akane.&quot; She slid the door open and was
horrified  by what she saw. In front of her was Ukyo and Shampoo,
passionately exploring each other with their hands as they kissed,
and just to add insult to injury, some of the buttons of Ukyo&#39;s
nightshirt had been opened, showing her cleavage to Shampoo.
&quot;WHAT THE HELL?!!!! SHAMPOOOOOO!!!!&quot; They both jumped and looked at
Akane. Ukyo was very embarrassed and prepared to explain herself.
Shampoo, on the other hand was on a  high from the kiss, and was so
pleased to see Akane, she began to giggle.

Akane was about to burst into tears. &quot;(sniff) UKYO?! Why is Shampoo
free? (sniff) WHY?!! (sniff) Why are you kissing her?&quot; &quot;Akane,
please don&#39;t cry! I can explain! It&#39;s...&quot; &quot;YOU DON&#39;T LOVE ME ANYMORE?!
Isn&#39;t that it? (sniff) Ohhh...I just want to die! (sniff)Ohh..(sniff)&quot;
&quot;Oh Akane I....&quot; &quot;(Shh...Ukyo. Remember. Words not good enough.)&quot;
Ukyo read the meaning of Shampoo&#39;s quiet whisper and began to smile
as she read it&#39;s meaning.

&quot;(Ohh, I understand Shampoo...go ahead. I think she&#39;ll like it.)&quot;
Shampoo inched her way over to Akane who was too busy crying bitter
tears to notice her. But then Shampoo gently gripped Akane&#39;s shoulders
with her soft Amazon fingers and got the girl&#39;s attention immediately.
Akane looked Shampoo in the eye, with a murderous look on her face.
&quot;What do YOU want, you Amazon Floozy?!&quot;

The second Akane finished her venomos sentence, Shampoo locked lips
with the Japanese girl, and then gave her the
Kiss of Death after releasing her mouth. &quot;The Kiss of Death?! You
want to kill me too?! Fine! Do it! I&#39;ve got nothing left to live
for!&quot; Ukyo butted in, desprite to explain Shampoo&#39;s actions to her
girlfriend. &quot;Akane, you don&#39;t understand, Shampoo just
gave you an Amazon marriage kiss. She wants to marry you.&quot;
Akane stopped crying. &quot;Wants to marry me? What the? What is this
Ukyo?&quot; &quot;Hee! Hee! She gave me the marriage kiss too. She wants to
marry us both! Hee! Hee! She LOVES us Akane!&quot; She looked into
the optimistic eyes of the Amazon, as she began to blush.

Like in Ukyo, the barriers began to fall inside of Akane as she
looked at this girl. &quot;Shampoo....is this true?&quot; Shampoo began to
blush too as she talked. &quot;Hee! Hee! It true! Shampoo loves you
Akane! Shampoo want to marry you...and Ukyo....and Ranma and spend
rest of life together! Akane is too too cute and sexy!&quot;
Akane was taken back by this and was about to reply, when Shampoo
continues to spill her heart. &quot;Also...Shampoo sorry for all the bad
things she do to Akane. Shampoo want to make up. Shampoo follow
Akane all week to try and declare love to her, but Shampoo too
shy to say. Until now. Shampoo love you....&quot;

All those feelings she described to Dr. Tofu, they began to flow
throughout her body. Should she take his advice, should she follow
her heart? Every vein in her body screamed out to her, they wanted
Shampoo, every last ounce of her being wanted Shampoo now.
But her mind...it confused her. Only minutes ago, she hated the
girl. How could she fall in love with her now? Her mind was in
turmoil. She put her hands to her head, as if she had a headache.
Ukyo was concerned. &quot;Akane? Are you ok? What&#39;s wrong?&quot;
&quot;Ohhh! This is SO confusing! My body&#39;s in love with her, but my
mind says not to love her. Oh this isn&#39;t fair! Why can&#39;t I think
straight?!!&quot;

&quot;(Shampoo, maybe if you kiss her? It worked with me.)&quot; &quot;(No....
Shampoo know better way.)&quot; She turned to Akane.
&quot;Ohh...Shampoo, I don&#39;t know what to think about you! I can&#39;t
think straight! OHH Why can&#39;t I think straight?!!!&quot; Akane was
truly in distress and felt like she was going to have a
nervous breakdown, any second now. Shampoo, now well educated from
reading her lesbian scrolls, knew exactly what to say and do here.
&quot;No Akane, not think...feel.&quot; Announced Shampoo with some confidence.
&quot;Huh? Feel?&quot; Shampoo walked right up to Akane, and closed the door
to the bedroom, so that no one but Ukyo could see what she would do
next.

The young Amazon stood in front of a confused Akane. She stood
so close to her, almost as if she was about to kiss her. Akane
began to tense every muscle in her body, unsure of what Shampoo
would do next, but she was also excited by this and waited in
quiet anticipation. &quot;Relax.....&quot; Whispered the Chinese girl
as she prepared to do something. Would it be a kiss? Or a
hug? No, it was none of these, it was something much better.

Shampoo took her index finger and placed it just below Akane&#39;s
navel. Akane looked at that finger for a few seconds, confused,
and wondering why she put it there. But then that confusion dissolved
as a wonderful feeling invaded her body. It was like an A-bomb
of pleasure had exploded in her vulva, and from that, a shockwave of
esctasy. Akane looked hypnotised as the effects of that touch set
in. She didn&#39;t blink as she stared into the smiling eyes of the girl
who was doing this wonderful thing to her.

The feeling was too much for her, Akane fell to her knees, but the
purple-haired Amazon managed to keep in contact as she fell.
Shampoo wasn&#39;t finished her task yet. The Tendo martial artist was in
fits of pleasure inside of herself. Her entire skin goose pimpled as
she felt countless little explosions of pleasure inside of her,
and then....she climaxed and fell to ground in a slump of ecstasy.

Ukyo didn&#39;t know what happened to Akane and suspected the worst.
&quot;Akane! What do did you do to her Shampoo?!!&quot; Akane put her hand
up to Ukyo to stop here for scolding Shampoo. She moaned with
some pleasure as she spoke. &quot;(Ohhhhhh...Ukyo, It&#39;s ok. ohhhhhh
that was the best feeling I ever had in my life. That was the
biggest orgasm I ever had.)&quot; Ukyo was confused. &quot;You orgasmed?
But Shampoo didn&#39;t go near your vulva? Shampoo, you want to explain?&quot;
&quot;Hee! Hee! Shampoo know ancient Amazon love-making technique.
Single touch on special points on girl&#39;s body cause great pleasure!&quot;

Akane used the last ounces of her strength to speak with the cursed
chinese girl. &quot;Shampoo?&quot; she whispered out &quot;Yes Akane?&quot; the Amazon
replied, leaning closer to the other girl, listening closely to her
soft voice, &quot;I...I love you.&quot; Moving back a bit in surprise, the
purple-haired girl gasped out, &quot;Thank you Akane! That make Shampoo
so so happy!!&quot;

As the effects of her super-orgasm caused Akane to doze off, Shampoo
looked over to Ukyo. &quot;Shampoo really look forward to this. Ukyo&#39;s turn
to get love touched!!&quot; Shampoo slowly and very seductivly walked over
to Ukyo. If she had know the Amazon Love Dance, she would have used it
now. Alas, she had to depend on her modest charms, which seemed enough
to attract the young cook. Ukyo was understandibly nervous as she spoke
to her. &quot;Your (gulp) going to do the same thing to me?&quot;
&quot;Shampoo use a different spot to give greater pleasure. Ohh Ukyo will
enjoy so much! Shampoo learn this especially as gift to girls she loves!
Now...Ukyo need to take clothes off.&quot; Ukyo&#39;s face lit up bright red.
&quot;You...you..you need me naked for this?!&quot;

&quot;Hee! Hee! Yes! Shampoo need Ukyo naked to make love to her!
Ohh...Shampoo long to see you naked, Ukyo so beautiful.&quot;
&quot;But Shampoo...I&#39;m..not comfortable with bearing all to people.&quot;
&quot;Really? This surprise Shampoo. Ukyo has wonderful body. If Ukyo
walked naked into Shampoo&#39;s village, she would be mistaken as a
goddess! Ukyo too beautiful to be anything less!&quot; &quot;Ohh.....
Shampoo, no one has ever been that....(sniff) nice about my
body before.&quot;

Ukyo centred herself, took a deep breath, and prepared herself
to take a brave step forward. What her new fiancee had just said
to her was enough to convince Ukyo to take a leap of faith, and
trust Shampoo. &quot;Ok..........I&#39;ll do it.&quot; &quot;Hee! Hee! Yes!&quot;
Ukyo slowly ran her hands down the centre of her nightshirt,
opening any closed button she came across. Ukyo was still shy,
but like with Akane, if the person truly liked they way she looked,
she would have no problems show them her well-shaped form.

Soon the shirt was fully open and Ukyo was ready slip it off. &quot;Well...
(gulp) Here goes nothing!&quot; In one fast motion, threw the nightshirt
and her shyness, off herself and across the room. Ukyo was now ready
for anyhthing, for in her nakedness, she had nothing left to fear,
or be ashamed of. &quot;Ok Shampoo, do you worst.&quot;

Shampoo giggled uncontrollably as she moved up to Ukyo.
&quot;Ohh, Shampoo loving this! Ukyo so sexy! Ok...going to touch you
now, in spot which cause heart orgasm.&quot; &quot;Heart Orgasm?&quot; &quot;You will
see...&quot; Shampoo took her index finger and playfully prepared to touch
her new lover with it. &quot;Ukyo ready?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m ready sugar, give it to me...&quot;
With that soft, elegant finger, she gently touched Ukyo in-between her
unyielding breasts.

At first she felt nothing, but that was only the calm before the storm.
With as much warning as lightining bolt, her heart began to pump
faster than it ever had. Then it began, all of her sexual senses
suddenly came to life with a level of power she had never felt
before. It was like a sexual beast had entered her body and was taking
over every organ it could find. She breathed heavily, she had to,
otherwise she would of passed out from the sheer power of it.
&quot;(gasp) (gasp) Shampoo.. (gasp) (gasp) What&#39;s happening to me?&quot;
&quot;Ukyo&#39;s body preparing to bear down like in child birth. Shampoo
touch heart to pump power of climax all over body.&quot; Seconds later Ukyo&#39;s
skin began to goose pimple, as her body began to climax.
But this was different to what she experienced when she made love
to Akane, it was at least 10 times more powerful.

Each pump of Ukyo&#39;s heart brought her that much closer to a
climax. Then...she couldn&#39;t hold it in anymore. She let out
quiet moan as she climaxed. She lost her footingas as her energy
slipped away, and began to fall backwards towards her bed,
and came in midair before she landed on it&#39;s soft sheets.
But even as she lay there, her orgasm wasn&#39;t finished.
It rippled up and down her body for a few seconds more.
She rolled around on the bed sheets as the feeling finally dissolved,
and then she lay still, exhausted from her experience.

Shampoo just stood there in the middle of the room and looked at her
naked fiencees as they lay there, trying to catch their breaths.
She was increadibly happy and proud of herself to have pulled this off,
against the odds. Even if they didn&#39;t really love her, she did
declare her love, and she did kind of make love them. She had proven
herself a worthy Amazon lesbian. That was almost enough for her,
even though, what she really wanted was the girls.

Both Akane and Ukyo, got their second wind and managed to pull
themselves to their feet. They staggered for a second and slumpted
into each other&#39;s arms for support. They held on to each other&#39;s
shoulders as they tried to get their bearings back after their
life-changing orgasms. They held on softly as the ecstasy of Shampoo&#39;s
touch was still in their bodies and couldn&#39;t help but playfully hold and
kiss each other as they stood there. Shampoo just stood there and
watched them. With a long sigh, the Amazon mumbled to herself.
&quot;Akane and Ukyo make perfect couple. Shampoo has no business
getting in-between.&quot; she then looked away from the scene,
&quot;Girls really hate Shampoo too. Shampoo just third wheel if stay.&quot;

Ukyo heard this quiet lament, and felt nothing but pity for the girl
as she turned to her lover and softly whispered into her ear.
&quot;(Aww, sugar, Shampoo is lovelorn. Are you thinking what I&#39;m thinking?)&quot;
&quot;(Hee! Hee! I hope so!)&quot; As Shampoo wallowed in self-pity and looked at
the ground in despair, the girls stealthfully approached her from either
side. Shampoo didn&#39;t notice then until she felt two sets of increadibly
soft lips kiss both her cheeks at the same time. She looked up with
surprise, and saw the loving faces of the girls on both sides of her.
&quot;Girls...do like me?&quot; Asked Shampoo softly in disbelief.

Akane reached deep down inside of herself to find something right to
say, before she spoke softly into her new lover&#39;s ear.
&quot;Well..it took a lot of soul searching, but Ukyo and I do...really...
love..you. We want you to marry Ranma with us!&quot; Shampoo was nearly
in tears when she looked over to Ukyo. &quot;Is (sniff) Is that true Ukyo?&quot;
&quot;Well...as you said &#39;Words not good enough&#39;. You ready Akane?&quot;
&quot;Hee! Hee! Yep!&quot;

They both gently but firmly took hold of Shampoo&#39;s dress and began to
pull it off her. Shampoo tensed up when she realised what they were
doing. &quot;Aww, sugar. Relax, I promise we won&#39;t hurt you.&quot; Shampoo
grinned and relaxed herself so the girls could strip her. The dress
came off, and soon the girls were peeling Shampoo&#39;s underwear off,
taking care to be as gentle as they possibly could be, and then
she was naked. Her face lit up with embarrassment, she had never
been this aroused before. Both Akane and Ukyo took an arm each and
brought Shampoo to the bed, she knew what was coming next as they
lay her down upon it.

They both lay on each side of her as they held her down on the
bed. With a long but refelctive sigh, Shampoo spoke to herself.
&quot;Ohh, Shampoo can&#39;t believe this! Finally get chance to make love!&quot;
Ukyo was a little surprised by this, but help but smile when she
learned this. &quot;First time suger? Don&#39;t worry, your in good hands.&quot;
&quot;I bet you&#39;ve been looking forward to this all week just like me!
Are you ready for this?&quot; The Chinese girl was a little nervous, but
was still wanted this, more than anything. &quot;Shampoo was always ready,
just never got a chance.&quot; Both Akane and Ukyo look each other and nod.
&quot;Well then sugar, brace yourself! Akane want to do the honors while
I work the rest?&quot; &quot;Hee! Hee! Here I go!&quot;

Akane slid down the bed as Ukyo moved her head closer to Shampoo&#39;s.
Ukyo whispered softly into Shampoo&#39;s ear. &quot;(Now sugar, we&#39;ll show
you how much we love you.)&quot; Ukyo closed her eyes and moved in for
a kiss. Those soft lips pressed up against her&#39;s again, but this time
with more love than before. All Shampoo could think, was of how lucky
she was, as she enjoyed her kiss. But her luck was about to improve.
Suddenly she felt the soft tongue of Aakne slowly ease it&#39;s way into
her vagina, and she tensed up immediately.

Ukyo stopped kissing so she could speak. &quot;Relax Shampoo, let Akane
do it. Believe it or not, she&#39;s very good at it.&quot; Shampoo relaxed
totally,went limp and let the girls have their way with her.
And then it began, waves of pleasure rippled throughout her body
as Ukyo massaged her it with hands and lips. Ukyo felt every inch of
her body with loving care. Below, Akane had begun to get into what
she was doing. But it wouldn&#39;t take long for Shampoo, all that
pent up energy, and those bottled up feelings, were getting
ready to be released in one massive explosion.

So...with little warning Shampoo screamed out as she climaxed and
came in an explosion of raw emotion. It had taken all the energy
she had left, away from her. She only had a few seconds of useful
consciousness left. The girls returned to their original positions
by her sides, to watch her fall asleep. As her eyes were closing she
saw their smiling faces. &quot;(Sweet dreams sugar)&quot; Whispered Ukyo softly
into her ear. On hearing that, exausted young Amazon went out like a
light. They looked at her lovingly as they lay there. &quot;Emm...Ukyo,
I&#39;m confused about something.&quot; &quot;Ohh? About what sugar?&quot;

&quot;Well, we used to hate her. I mean really HATE her. But now when I look
at her face, I can only feel love. How could we change so quickly?&quot;
&quot;Hmm...Well a wise man once said that hate, was like baggage that you
carried throughout your life, so your better off, just leaving it behind.
I think that&#39;s what happened, we let go of our hatred for Shampoo,
and found that we loved her. And now we&#39;ve got this cute little
Chinese kitten sleeping in-between us.&quot; &quot;So..all three of us to marry
Ranma? Just think of the family we&#39;ll have!&quot; &quot;I prefer to think of the
good times we&#39;ll have together, we&#39;ll never be alone. I can think of
nothing that could ruin this on us...&quot; She looked at Shampoo&#39;s face
and smiled. &quot;....nothing at all.......&quot;

--------------------------

As the sun rose over Tokyo, Nerima was painted a shade of blood red
where darkness didn&#39;t rule. Nerima&#39;s temple, remained shouded in
darkness, and on top of this building stood a shadowy female figure.
She looked upon Nerima from her perch, waiting for something.
Where she would wear earrings, were two star shaped lights
which shone a dark, alomst evil, shade of purple.

And then she spoke. &quot;(All three are together now......)&quot;
She looked down towards Ucchan&#39;s. &quot;(Soon...they will be mine....)&quot;
