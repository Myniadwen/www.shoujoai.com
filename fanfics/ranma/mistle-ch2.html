------------------------------------------------

	It should be white, she decides.  After all, everything around 
Christmas is white.  Snow.  Santa&#39;s beard.  That may be only two items 
to prove that everything should be white around Christmas, but it must 
be true, or the author wouldn&#39;t have brought it up in the first place. 
	But it is not white.  First of all, it&#39;s slightly off-white.  The 
kind of white that is called beige, but everyone knows is just a fancy 
way of saying dirty-white.  The same color that the author looks at 
when he eyes the rim of his monitor or the plastic keys of his 
keyboard.  Akane Tendo eyes the glass of Eggnog suspiciously.  Why is 
it called Eggnog?  First of all, there are little specks of spice 
floating around inside it.  Eggs don&#39;t have little specks floating 
around inside them.  These spices could be anything from cinnamon to 
fragments of a neutron star core, and she is certain no Egg has 
fragments of a neutron star in them, even if they WERE lucky enough to 
have cinnamon inside.  This doesn&#39;t even touch on the subject that the 
volume of Eggs that go into making such a glass of liquid cannot 
possibly be greater than the volume of milk put into it.  Why not call 
it Milknog?  Even as thoughts of Milknog fly through her mind, however, 
she knows that is not the reason she is eyeing the glass of Eggnog 
suspiciously.  
	She is trying to decide if this clear glass full of Eggnog is not 
white enough, or not beige enough.  It may be a little too brown, and 
that would warrant the suspicion that Rum was added to this Eggnog.  
Nabiki is near by, so she shares a suspicious look from Akane that is 
divided between her sister and the glass of Eggnog.  Rum in Eggnog is 
quite nice on a cold night by the fire, but it also can be a little too 
nice for Akane when she is trying to confess Secrets to Ranma.  As 
anyone will tell you, too much of anything, even nice, is bad.  Or at 
least, is not as good as just a little bit less than too much.
	Even as she thinks how badly she needs to avoid Eggnog and Rum 
tonight, the thought of drinking Eggnog appeals to her greatly, and in 
a rush, her mind agrees with her throat and mouth that the Eggnog must 
be white or beige enough to be perfectly safe.    
	Though the mouth&#39;s scientific, biological name is not `hatch&#39;, 
Akane Tendo pours the contents of the glass (now perfectly safe in her 
own mind) down `the hatch&#39;.  

	Now, that is quite a deliberation for someone to undertake when 
they are doing something as simple as contemplating a glass of Eggnog, 
or Milknog, or NeutronStarCoreNog.  But you see, there is yet another 
good reason for that horribly long introduction to a story who&#39;s 
predecessor would already have been into the heavy breathing and 
partial nudity by now.  
	Tonight is the night that Akane Tendo decides she has to tell 
Ranma Saotome a Secret.  Akane Tendo knows that if she isn&#39;t careful, 
that Secret could cause the new-found situation between her and Ranma 
to turn into a state known only as FUBAR.  
	FUBAR is the abbreviation to the wonderfully colorful phrase:

	&quot;Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition&quot;

	And Akane Tendo definitely does NOT want to Fuck Up Beyond All 
Recognition what she finally got through her thick skull she had with 
Ranma for almost 7 seasons of episodes and a few more movies than the 
two the author has seen.  
	To FUBAR your One True Love is a very bad thing.  Many other 
colorful phrases (that the author takes no shame in sharing, knowing 
that ONLY readers of 18 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER are reading this...) such 
as &quot;Screw The Pooch&quot; and &quot;You Need A Cunt Stretched Over Your Head And 
Some Sense Fucked Into It&quot; come to mind.  (YNACSOYHASSFII is a personal 
favorite)
	But how on Earth, or perhaps even Pluto, could Akane Tendo FUBAR 
her newly admitted relationship with her destined One True Love?  Easy.  
She could tell her One True Love her Secret, and/or she could drink 
Eggnog with Rum and later on tonight, change FUBAR into a VERB, and 
madly copulate with Ranma with little inhibitions!  
	That by itself would not be a FUBAR thing to do.  After all, she 
has been dreaming about it for some time now.  Even if those dreams had 
been running in the Hentai theater next-door to her mind&#39;s eye, she 
knew they existed, even when she refused to give into curiosity and buy 
a ticket...not knowing that it is impossible for Curiosity of a movie 
to Kill a Cat.  After all, who would give a cat a movie ticket?  Not 
anyone the author is aware of.  
	So why would copulating with extreme prejudice be a FUBAR thing 
to do tonight?  Because tonight is Christmas Eve.  No drugstore is open 
within a disturbingly large radius to the Tendo Dojo.  That also means 
no form of contraceptive is available as of fifteen minutes to 6 
PM...because nobody in their right mind would not use the excuse of a 
holiday to close shop early.  
	Also, though the chances of this happening in real-life are only 
about 30 to 1, it is an Anime, and therefore, odds don&#39;t mean much;  
Akane Tendo is ovulating, and her body&#39;s natural reproductive systems 
are nearly screaming to be FUBARed in the verb sense.  
	She thinks about this as she drinks the rest of her Eggnog.  The 
internal battle between the past-tense and present-tense FUBAR 
definitions wages on as she tries to decide of which one will occur 
tonight.
	Carefully, she decides to examine the facts.  She is very proud 
to remember to do this.  Ten years of watching dubbed Scooby Doo re-
runs have paid off after all.  

	Fact 1:  During those ten years of Scooby Doo re-runs, she never 
got laid.  Not even during a commercial break.  This was due to mainly 
a lack of a sex drive.  After all, not many 10 year olds can boast an 
active sex life.  Oh, and a lack of interest in male sex organs.  Who 
would bother becoming interested in something one did not own anyway??  
	Fact 2:  After those Scooby Doo re-runs, for the nine additional 
years of her life, Akane Tendo refused to get laid.  Even during the 
commercial break.  This time, it was due to a lack of her One True Love 
being available.  That, and the fact she would probably copulate with 
Scooby Doo before she would think of copulating with most guys at her 
school...who gave new meaning to the acronym: YNACSOYHASSFII.
	Fact 3:  Now that she has found her One True Love, ditched the 
men who Need A Cunt Stretched Over...well...you know..., and put to 
rest her well-hidden Scooby Doo fetish, Akane Tendo is horny has hell.  
Nineteen years of sex-drive is a lot of revving up to do.
	Fact 4:  If Akane Tendo gets pregnant from tonight&#39;s encounter 
with Ranma Saotome, all hell will break loose.  Too much hell to 
ignore, and way too much to experience on Christmas Eve.  Who would 
want to go through hell on Christmas Eve?  
	Fact 5:  Akane has some added options.  Though Ranma Saotome is 
her One True Love...he is not like most other One True Loves.  After 
all, if he WAS normal, the Ranma 1/2 series would really suck.  
	
	And that is where Akane gets her Secret.  The Secret she has to 
either keep a Secret, or tell her One True Love.  

	The eggnog is now gone, replaced with air from the surrounding 
atmosphere.  Akane ponders what would happen if the air did not replace 
the eggnog as she drank it, and the cup imploded in her hand.  Perhaps 
that would give her something more to do, and let her avoid the Secret 
for a few more minutes as she contacted the Discovery Channel in 
regards to the amazing imploding eggnog glass.


	Now, Ranma Saotome also has a Secret.  He has a few, actually.  
The least of these is the fact he loves to watch Akane Tendo drink 
eggnog.  Why is it called eggnog?  Who gives a shit.  As long as Akane 
Tendo, his One True Love is drinking it.
	As you can tell, the Male mind is much more efficient.  Instead 
of cluttering up thought with needless thoughts about neutron stars and 
imploding cups, it dives straight into the good stuff.  Sex.  Though 
some may think it perverse to think of Sex so often in one given day, 
others will realize it actually is a very helpful tool to keep the mind 
focused on the task at hand.  
	(The Author wonders how many people will recognize the 
unintentional masturbation euphemism in that last sentence...then moves 
on.)
	By focusing his thoughts to how Akane Tendo drinks eggnog, and 
filtering them through an erotic light, Ranma hopes to be able to take 
his mind off of how badly he wants Akane Tendo to come to his room 
later on that night, become naked, and FUBAR him until morning.
	
	Unfortunately, watching Akane Tendo drink eggnog is surprisingly 
erotic.  Though very efficient, focusing one&#39;s mind on sex has the 
sometimes forgivable side-effect of heightening one&#39;s sexual awareness.  
However, this is not one of those times.  Instead, this is a time for a 
cold shower.  


	Akane, Nabiki, Soun and Genma all blink curiously as Ranma jumps 
up, bows quickly, and runs head-first down the hall with the intent to 
take such a cold shower.  
	&quot;What&#39;s with him?&quot; Genma asks, but because he is in Panda form, 
it sounds more like &quot;Grrwooorrooophh?&quot;
	&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Nabiki shrugs, understanding what 
&quot;Grrwoorrooophh&quot; means because she has heard it so many times in the 
last few seasons and movies.    
	Akane wishes her eggnog had rum in it.  It would also help if she 
had some eggnog in her glass before it imploded and she would have to 
focus her attention on calling the Discovery Channel instead at how 
Ranma Saotome was gazing at her all night over the steaming turkey and 
stuffing and pie and potatoes.  
	Akane also smiles, however.  If all goes well, she&#39;ll at least be 
able to tell her One True Love a Secret or two tonight.  


	Back to poor Ranma.  &quot;Man,&quot; he says.  Actually, now he is a she, 
because of the cold shower.  That is his other Secret, though it is 
only a Secret to stupid people who Need A Cunt Stretched Over Their 
Head and Some Sense Fucked Into It.  Akane Tendo, his One True Love, 
knows about THAT secret.  THAT Secret is not a Secret to them.  
	&quot;I need a cunt stretched over my head and some sense fucked into 
it.&quot; She sighs.  Ranma reaches over to the shower-taps and turns the 
tap marked &quot;C&quot; to only half, and the tap marked &quot;H&quot; on to full.  A 
moment later, he is a he again.  All his genitalia in place because of 
the cold shower he just took as a she.  
	It&#39;s not like he didn&#39;t LIKE watching Akane Tendo drink Eggnog 
all night, but the problem is that he had to focus on OTHER things than 
that tonight, or he would FUBAR Akane, and end up becoming a parent if 
the laws of Anime had anything to do about it.  That was something he 
wasn&#39;t quite ready for.  Even if it was with his One True Love.  
	He had to force his mind to focus on something else tonight.  
Perhaps getting drunk so fast he passed out before any heavy petting 
occurred.  The only problem with that was that Ranma has Spooky Anime 
Powers, and would be able to raise his Blood Alcohol Level to Fifty 
Percent before he passed out.  Such a feat would be impossible for 
anyone in the real world...unless they were related in some way to half 
of the Betty Ford patients combined.  
	Ranma Saotome decided it was probably best if he stayed a She 
tonight.  Keeping true to his promise, before he heads out of the 
bathroom, he turns on the cold water one more time.  &quot;YEAAAG!!!&quot; he 
screams, because that is what one screams when hit by horribly ice cold 
water.  


	Akane Tendo finds Ranma Saotome in his/her room, getting dressed 
in a white shirt and black pants that could, in an emergency, be very 
nice clothes for either a man or a woman.  Ranma has learned to shop 
smart over these last few seasons and movies, and therefore, much of 
his clothing is instantly adaptable to either sex.  
	Ranma turns around to see Akane standing there, as that is what 
she was doing.  &quot;Ahh!  I didn&#39;t see you standing there.&quot; She says, 
finishing doing up her pants.  
	&quot;Well, I was just wondering if you were okay.&quot; Akane smiles 
slightly and leans suggestively against the wall.  &quot;Are you okay?  Do 
you need help with anything?&quot;
	Ranma just noticed Akane&#39;s leaning (and very damn sexy leaning, I 
might add...) and gets a lump caught in her throat.  Actually, 
medically, it&#39;s not a lump, however, Ranma still feels it.  
&quot;Uh...actually, I&#39;m good...&quot;
	Akane nods.  &quot;Why did you change into a woman, then?&quot;  This is a 
very good question.  After all, normally Ranma enjoys having the 
ability to pee standing up, and does NOT enjoy having breasts to 
interfere with his/her punches.
	Now, Ranma was JUST about to say &quot;Because if I were still a man 
I&#39;d grab you, throw you onto the bed, and FUBAR you far into the 
morning with the only interruption being to open Christmas Presents, 
and then return to FUBARing you.&quot;  HOWEVER, because he is now a she, 
SHE does not have the straightforward-thinking-male-mind working at 
perfect capacity.  So, instead, all that comes out as:  &quot;Because you 
looked very beautiful tonight, and I didn&#39;t want to embarrass myself 
like...last time...in front of everyone.&quot;
	That&#39;s actually a very valid reason, so Akane is fooled by it.  
&quot;Really?  That&#39;s very sweet.&quot; She blushes and smiles.  &quot;You know, for a 
minute there, I thought you were going to say it was because if you 
were still a man you&#39;d grab me, throw me onto the bed, and start 
FUBARing me until we had to open presents the next day.&quot;
	Ranma develops a rather large sweat drop on her forehead.  &quot;Who 
me?  I&#39;d never think a thing like that!&quot;  Ranma has just proven the 
fact that although all Men are Liars, all Women are Hypocrites. Hehe.  
	&quot;Well, come on downstairs.&quot; Akane says.  &quot;The rest of the family 
are going to bed, and we can talk as we finish up supper.&quot;  


	Of course, any romantic evening has to be set up with long 
moments of planning to be truly romantic.  Though Akane was very brief 
in her request that they go downstairs to finish dinner, that was just 
a casual front to what she had really planned.  With the holiday season 
coming up, there was nobody using the dojo.  Considering some of their 
nicest...and ONLY...bonding moments had been while fighting, attempting 
to fight, or arguing...it seemed an ideal romantic spot.  	
	The lights were dimmed, a table erected in the center of the mat, 
and the soft, flickering glow of candlelight filled the room, making 
the large, open space seem much more comfortable and cozy.  Before you 
think that this is a little too stereotypical for a romantic scene, 
think how many romantic conquests have begun in the back of an alleyway 
amidst rodents and garbage?  See?  I thought so.  

	Knowing full well that neither of them will be hungry after the 
first portion of supper, Akane has arranged for only a plate of snacks 
and a very large bottle of wine to be present on the table.  While a 
bottle of wine can make someone feel quite nicely indeed, there were, 
after all, two of them.  That was a very important component of the 
night&#39;s activities, so obviously, with the number of occupants fixed, 
the alcohol had to be changed.  
	Ranma, upon seeing this arrangement, is very confused.  Not 
because he is especially dimwitted, of course.  After all, ignoring a 
beautiful woman that has a strong will, a strong heart, and a stunning 
smile for several seasons and a movie happens ALL THE TIME to smart men 
too!!

	Don&#39;t believe me?

	Watch the X-Files.

	Back to anime, however, Ranma is confused simply for the 
fact that He is currently a She, and is being pulled into a romantic 
evening by Akane, who is most definitely (determined by the shape of 
her body underneath her blouse) also a She.  
	That would not be so strange if she had a kettle of hot water to 
change the situation, but there is none in sight.  Unless of course, 
the wine is warm, and she intends to pour it all over his body and 
clean it off with any means possible.  

	Ranma blinks at the mental image and his heart skips a beat.  

	Akane notices Ranma&#39;s small, happy grin on his/her face and 
raised an eyebrow.  &quot;What???&quot;
	&quot;Oh...nothing...&quot; Ranma snaps out of it, and they move over to 
the table and sit down on their knees, facing each other across the 
candles, wine, and snacks that the Author is too lazy to name.  
	The wine is cold (to the slight disappointment to Ranma&#39;s 
fantasy) and very good.  So good that they are on their second glass 
before the small-talk has come to the latest Sailor Moon Seven Knights 
episode, and how weird it was.
	&quot;So,&quot; Akane smiled, taking a candy cane from the plate of 
goodies.  &quot;What did you wish for Christmas?&quot;
	Ranma pours herself another glass of wine and shrugs.  &quot;Mmm, I 
kinda wanted a plane ticket to China...&quot; she pauses when she sees 
Akane&#39;s eyes roll.  After all, that&#39;s about the only thing he&#39;s been 
wishing to have for the last few years.  &quot;But...&quot; she continues, 
surprising Akane &quot;I saw a really nice sweater down at Yen Mart the 
other day.&quot;
	Akane tries not to show how happy she is to hear this, especially 
since it would give it away Ranma would get that precise present 
tomorrow, compliments of her noticing how he was looking at the sweater 
through the window last week.  &quot;I&#39;m sure Santa will keep that in mind.&quot; 
She nods.  
	&quot;How about you?&quot; Ranma smiles.  &quot;There must be something you 
want.&quot;  
	Akane takes a long, deep breath.  &quot;I want to tell you a secret.&quot;
	Ranma blinks, knowing that secrets are not usually advertised in 
the Yen Mart Christmas Catalogue.  Even if they were in there, poor 
Ranma probably wouldn&#39;t be able to afford them anyway.  Secrets are 
usually either very cheep, or very...VERY...expensive.  Even just the 
plain, gray-colored ones without the felt insert to keep you cozy on a 
cold, winter say. 
	&quot;What do you mean, a Secret?&quot; she asks, ignoring the way Akane is 
gently unwrapping her candy cane with the tips of her delicate fingers.  
After all, she is not a he, and does not normally notice things like 
that unless he has male genitalia to urge his mind to focus.  
	Though, of course, not even changing sex could save him from 
noticing how her tongue came out and began to caress the very tip of 
the candy.  &quot;It&#39;s a very strange Secret.&quot; Akane says, after licking the 
candy cane for a moment.  &quot;One that I&#39;m not sure you&#39;ll like.&quot;
	Ranma is dazed by the way her tongue is glistening in the 
candlelight, and barely nods.  Her hand comes up and quickly pours 
herself another glass of wine, that is swallowed in one gulp 
afterwards.  
	&quot;Do you remember the day I found out about your...Secret?&quot; Akane 
asks quietly.  There is no need to be quiet, though, since the dojo is 
quite obviously sound-proofed as to not disturb the residents during 
classes.  
	Ranma is not lost on this fact, and deducts that she must have 
something very important on her mind.  Despite what some women think 
about men, they are more than capable of putting emotions and thought 
ahead of sex.  He...rather She...is now listening intently to his/her 
One True Love.  &quot;Yes, of course!&quot; Ranma nods.  &quot;What&#39;s this Secret, 
anyway?&quot;
	&quot;I don&#39;t know if I should tell you.&quot; Akane admits.  &quot;I&#39;m not 
quite drunk enough to not know if I should or not.&quot; She smiles sadly.  
&quot;I wanted to just tell you, but even now, I think back to other 
times...and I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll like it, or not like it.&quot;
	Ranma is now worried.  &quot;Please.&quot; She begs.  &quot;I promise that even 
if I don&#39;t like it, I&#39;ll never hold it against you.&quot;
	&quot;What if I want you to hold it against me?&quot; Akane smiles, gently 
pushing the candy cane into her lips, greeting it with the pink tip of 
her tongue.  
	Despite himself being HERself, Ranma makes a quiet, whimpering 
noise.  &quot;Akane...&quot;
	Even while trying to remain focused on telling her Secret, Akane 
feels a shiver run up and down her spine at her One True Love&#39;s little 
noise.  &quot;Sorry...&quot; she smiles sweetly, putting down the striped candy.  
	Ranma pours and slams back another glass very quickly in order to 
remain calm. &quot;So, please...&quot; she hiccups.  &quot;Continue...don&#39;t worry.  I 
promise I will like your secret.&quot; She smiles...but even then, she&#39;s not 
so sure anymore.
	&quot;Okay.&quot; She sighs, reaching over and fills her glass, downing it 
in the same fashion as her dinner companion had been doing.  &quot;First of 
all, though, I want to tell you something else.  It&#39;s not really a 
Secret...just something that I wouldn&#39;t tell anyone else.&quot;
	&quot;Not even P-Chan?&quot; 
	&quot;Not even P-Chan.&quot; Akane nods.
	Ranma smiles.  This must be important, then, and she&#39;s telling 
me!  JUST me!  Secrets are even better when shared between One True 
Loves.  &quot;Okay.  Tell me this Semi-Secret first.&quot;
	&quot;You remember last night, I hope.&quot; Akane smiles and blushes.  She 
blushes because of all the wonderful physical and emotional sensations 
she felt that night...but also because of the ones she knows she helped 
Ranma feel as well.  
	&quot;Of course...&quot; she nods with a smile and a blush.  Had their 
physical appearances been the same, their exactly same expressions 
would have made it look like Akane was staring into a mirror.  Luckily, 
this was not the case, or the Author would go crazy with the mental 
images and how to separate them.  
	Akane continues.  &quot;After I went to bed...I...&quot; she looks 
up...directly into Ranma&#39;s eyes.  &quot;I touched myself.&quot;
	Ranma&#39;s jaw nearly dropped...but couldn&#39;t even if it wanted to.  
She was stunned, looking into the beautiful woman&#39;s beautiful eyes as 
she told him/her that she masturbated for hours due to the brief 
contact they had that night.  How she had to remove her undergarments 
before they got too wet, only to find taking them off was making things 
worse.  How she eventually filled the aching need to hold something by 
wrapping herself around one of her pillows and rubbing herself up and 
down the silky fabric&#39;s edge.  How the teasing and the eggnog and the 
near-dreamlike state she was in let her imagine that the pillow and her 
fingers were Ranma.  
	How, later, she was so close to the edge of an orgasm, that she 
had to stop before she passed out...only to start again a few minutes 
later as her fingers wandered lower on her body, curious to see if she 
was still as wet and hot as she felt.  
	How, finally, with her mind&#39;s eyes filled with him, and her 
fingers helping to fill elsewhere with thought of him, she had the most 
earth-shattering orgasm she had ever dared reach in her life.  Ranma 
watched her lips speak these words, and would not break away, even if 
World War Three was going on behind them.  
	&quot;When...&quot; Akane was almost red now, &quot;...I finally woke 
up...everything was soaked, and I was still hugging the pillow like I 
thought it was you in my dreams.&quot; She smiled shyly, looking away from 
the bead of drool that had formed from Ranma&#39;s lips.  
	
	Now, this was an interesting development, Ranma&#39;s brain whispered 
to his heart, mind and body.  You seem to have wet your pants, Ranma!
	&quot;Shut up!&quot; Ranma whispered to his brain.

	&quot;Pardon?&quot; Akane asked suddenly, breaking his inner dialogue.
	Ranma snapped out of it and quickly, embarrassed, wiped the drool 
from her lips.  &quot;Sorry...I...I&#39;m just not...used to...&quot;
	&quot;Me talking about how I came like the Earthquake of 1997?&quot; Akane 
whispered.
	Ranma nodded weakly.  &quot;Yes.&quot; She had to look away, but upon 
noticing the dark patch of wetness between her legs, forced herself to 
look back.  &quot;I...I&#39;m not used to hearing how people fantasize about 
me.&quot;
	Akane blushed.  &quot;Oh, in that case, I have a few more Secrets to 
tell you.&quot;
	&quot;What do you mean...&quot; Ranma swallowed hard.  &quot;...a FEW?&quot;
	She nodded shyly, all of a sudden.  &quot;Well...the last few Seasons 
and Movies have been very lonely, Ranma.  Even though we weren&#39;t like 
we are now, I still knew in my heart that I was attracted to you.&quot; She 
blushes again.  &quot;VERY attracted to you.&quot;
	Ranma was smiling like an idiot, and Akane had to laugh.  She 
laughed back.  &quot;Well, sorry...I just thought everyone thought I was a 
freak.&quot;
	Akane&#39;s smile fades into a look of adoration, just like the one 
she had last night, between the bouts of sexually charged gazes.  
	&quot;Akane?&quot; Ranma asks, because she wants to ask a question.
	&quot;Yes?&quot; she replies, because she was asked to.
	Ranma raises an eyebrow.  &quot;Why did you tell me all that?  About 
your night last night?&quot; she blushes.  &quot;I mean, I&#39;m flattered, but I&#39;d 
like to know why you told me.&quot;
	Akane nods.  &quot;It&#39;s very important.&quot; She nods again, as if to seem 
serious, but because of the wine, she looks rather cute with her 
exaggerated head movements. 
	&quot;Hehe.&quot;
	&quot;Hey!&quot; she giggles.  &quot;Don&#39;t laugh.  I am being serious.&quot; She 
recomposes herself and nods less comically.  &quot;It&#39;s proof.&quot;
	&quot;Proof?&quot;
	&quot;Yes.&quot; Akane moves over on the table, leaning into it, gazing at 
Ranma&#39;s face.  &quot;It&#39;s proof that, no matter what, I find you a very 
attractive man.  Proof that, when we can, I am going to make love to 
you all day and all night.  Even if we have to get a loan from Nabiki 
and get a room away from here so we&#39;re not interrupted.  I will 
personally make you the happiest man on Earth.&quot;
	Ranma&#39;s drool threatens to make a return as she gazes at this 
woman who is now informing him that this may be a very VERY happy new 
year.  
	&quot;And Ranma?&quot;
	&quot;Yeah...?&quot; she whimpers.
	&quot;I already have the reservations.&quot; She smiles as Ranma nearly 
passes out.
	&quot;Oh god...&quot;
	
	Akane nods, suddenly getting her serious face again.  &quot;Do you 
know why I told you this?&quot;
	&quot;Your Secret?&quot; Ranma asks weakly.
	&quot;I haven&#39;t told you my Secret yet.&quot; Akane smiles.

	Ranma&#39;s mind informs itself that there is NO WAY IN HELL that 
being in the exclusive company of Akane with the intent to FUBAR would 
be bad in any way...so notices that all that stuff about Masturbation 
and Hotels had not yet come onto what the Secret was.
	&quot;Please...&quot; she says quickly.  &quot;...Akane...you&#39;ve made your 
point...and if you don&#39;t tell me soon, I&#39;m going to go insane...&quot; Ranma 
admits.  &quot;I&#39;m not going to be able to understand what you&#39;re saying if 
I can&#39;t help watching your...god...lips move like that.&quot;
	Akane blushes again, but does not smile.  This is still serious.  
&quot;Very well.&quot; She concedes.  &quot;I mean, it&#39;s not like I have to call the 
Discovery Channel up to tell them about imploding eggnog glasses or 
anything.&quot; She takes a deep, shaky breath, puffing out her chest and 
clenching her fists.  &quot;Ranma...I want you to make love to me tonight.&quot;
	Ranma nods, then stops.  Something isn&#39;t right, here.  
	Akane sees the instant of confusion and closes her eyes.  &quot;Now.  
Like this.&quot;

	Slowly, the math centers of Ranma&#39;s mind begin to churn with the 
equation:

                        FR + FA + (NC) = XXX

	Where, FR = Female Ranma, FA = Female Akane, NC = No Conception, 
and XXX = Fun.

	This makes sense, after all.  They don&#39;t want to have a child 
yet.  Not yet, anyway.  They both want XXX right now, that much is 
clear by the feelings swimming around in both their bodies...and a 
Female Akane and Female Ranma satisfy the equation.

	Wait a moment?

	Female RANMA?

	Ranma finally looks up at Akane, locking onto her eyes.  &quot;Oh 
my...&quot;
	She nods with a half-smile.  
	&quot;Oh my.&quot; Ranma repeats herself, noticing that she is still a she.  
&quot;Oh...my...&quot;
	Akane takes a deep breath and gently takes Ranma&#39;s shaking hands 
into hers.  &quot;What I didn&#39;t tell you about those Few Other Secrets is 
that sometimes, I&#39;d wonder what it would be like to make love to you 
while you were a woman.&quot;
	Ranma can only blink.
	&quot;I told you the stuff before because I want you to know that I 
will still and forever love you as my MAN.&quot; She smiles weakly.  &quot;But, I 
also want you to know that, even when you&#39;re like this...you are still 
my One True Love.&quot;
	&quot;Akane...please...I...&quot; Ranma tries to figure out what he/she is 
thinking, but it&#39;s a lot more difficult than it sounds.  
	Fear is evident in Akane&#39;s eyes.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; tears begin to 
swell in her eyes, to the dismay of Ranma.  &quot;I knew you were always so 
proud to be a man, and you hated being a woman most of the time...I 
just hoped that I could show you that...I loved you as both.&quot;
	
	To Akane&#39;s surprise, Ranma reaches over, grabs the wine, tilts 
the bottle to her mouth, and drinks.  And drinks.  

	Finally, with most of the wine gone now, Ranma puts the bottle 
down, slightly calmer.  &quot;Akane...&quot;
	&quot;Yes?&quot;
	Before another word is said, Ranma leans over the table, takes 
Akane&#39;s chin in her hand, and brings her closer for a kiss.  Their lips 
collide in an instant, deep, passionate kiss, and Akane&#39;s balance is 
lost.  She falls over backwards, causing Ranma to smack her face into 
the table.  
	They both regain balance and sit at their opposite sides of the 
table.  Akane is blushing.  &quot;I suppose this means my Secret was a good 
thing.&quot;
	&quot;Sorry.&quot; Ranma hiccuped with a sudden grin.
	&quot;You...&quot; Akane paused.  &quot;You don&#39;t mind?&quot;
	Ranma clears her head away of wine-induced thought enough to give 
Akane an affirmative nod.  &quot;I was thinking about this last night...&quot; 
she smiled &quot;...though, I obviously wasn&#39;t having as much fun as you 
were, I did decide that this little...&quot; she pointed down at her breasts 
&quot;...problem had to come up sooner or later.&quot;
	&quot;Oh?&quot;
	&quot;Yes.&quot; Ranma continued.  &quot;The only real problem I had while being 
a woman was thinking you wouldn&#39;t be attracted to me.  That you&#39;d think 
of me as just the Female Ranma, and not Ranma.&quot;  That&#39;s a lot of Ranmas 
to keep track of, but she continues without a pause.
	&quot;Really?&quot; Akane&#39;s sweet, sexy eyes lock onto Ranma&#39;s.  
	&quot;Really.&quot; She replied, gently taking Akane&#39;s hand and kissing it 
like a knight in shining armor would do...only with breasts.  Akane 
couldn&#39;t help but notice her One True Love&#39;s lips were softer right 
now, more like her own.  Though she enjoyed the other set more, these 
ones were hardly unpleasant.  
	For a moment, Akane was worried that tonight...by the way Ranma 
was now kissing her wrist and moving up her arm slowly...was going to 
just make her want HIM more.
	Then again, what was so wrong with that?  She shivered slightly 
as Ranma began to use her tongue to trace a line along the underside of 
her arm, tickling her, but also keeping her captured in the sensation.  
&quot;Ranma?&quot; she whispered.  &quot;Uh, the table...&quot;
	CRASH!  Ranma kicked it out of the way without a second thought.  
After all, she was on a mission now.  Actually, He was on the mission, 
just with a borrowed female body structure.  This mission started with 
her arm.  Smooth, soft skin that she could feel tense slightly with 
toned muscles under her kisses.  Then, to the shoulders.  Though 
adjusting how close she had to be because of her chest, Ranma managed 
to maneuver herself behind Akane and start to kiss her shoulders 
and...oh yes...neck.  
	Whatever worries Akane had about Eggnog and Secrets were 
completely lost from her mind, right about the time where Ranma began 
to gently lick along her neck and just behind her right ear.  She let 
out a soft whimper despite her strong resolve, and Ranma knew she had 
found the right spot.  Another light, wet nuzzle, and a honey-sweet cry 
came from Akane&#39;s lips.
	&quot;Let me help you with that...&quot; Ranma whispered, reaching around 
Akane&#39;s stomach and letting the smaller-female-hand-advantage begin to 
pop open the tiny buttons on the milk-white blouse Akane had on.  Akane 
only nodded, letting her own soft, delicate hands come up and guide her 
lover&#39;s.  
	&quot;Is this part...&quot; Akane gasped as Ranma&#39;s arms brushed against 
the sides of her breasts.  &quot;...P...part of the Saotome School of 
Anything Goes?&quot;
	Ranma couldn&#39;t help but smile.  She had actually thought of the 
exact response to that many nights ago.  &quot;If it&#39;s with you?&quot; she 
whispered back.  &quot;Anything goes.&quot;
	Though a daunting statement, Akane found herself melting into 
those words.  The words, and the way Ranma was now kissing her exposed 
back as he folded her blouse away from her skin.  &quot;Th...&quot; she 
whispered, shaking in anticipation.  &quot;I...also dreamt of this...&quot; she 
let out a tiny yelp of pleasure as Ranma skillfully managed to undo her 
simple, white bra with her teeth.
	&quot;Me too...&quot; she whispered back, gently undressing her entire top 
half with kisses and skillful hands.  Ranma just let go at that point, 
and any inhibitions of female arousal were washed away.  If this were 
some stranger off the street...some one night stand...someone he didn&#39;t 
love with all HIS heart, he would have thought differently.  But 
hearing the pleasant, heavy sounds of Akane&#39;s sexual and emotional 
excitement was rubbing off on him...even though his Curse.  He decided 
to enjoy it as well.
	Akane seemed to have the same idea, and when she leaned back into 
her lover&#39;s arms, kissing deeply, her own hands began to take Ranma&#39;s 
shirt off, bit by bit.  Ranma&#39;s breath caught as he looked down along 
Akane&#39;s silk white skin and caught sight of her naked breasts.  

	Oh yes.

	This was rather pleasant.  

	Akane, without Ranma&#39;s lips to suckle on, decided to attach to 
the next best thing.  With a careful roll, she was suddenly on top, and 
her hands lifted the remnants of Ranma&#39;s shirt off over her head.  
	The cold, brisk winter air that was only hinted at inside the 
dojo was suddenly contrasted as Akane slid herself on top of her lover 
and pressed their breasts together.  She had a sultry smile on her lips 
as Ranma gave out a happy little sound that was somewhere between a 
moan and a sigh.  &quot;So, Ranma, darling...?&quot;
	&quot;Uh huh?&quot; she gasped back as their lips met in a hard, passionate 
kiss.  
	&quot;I forgot the mistletoe.&quot; She smiled.  &quot;Think we should stop and 
find it?&quot; Her voice was barely a whisper...yet every breath was like 
fire against skin.  
	Her short, blue hair was playfully messy, and a strand of it was 
stuck on the tip of her nose.  Her eyes were bright, and fire lit them 
up in the candlelight, threatening to draw Ranma into them.  Red, full 
lips that, even now, brushed up against her own and teased with a 
tongue that felt much too good to be true against her own.  At that 
moment, Ranma had seen nothing more beautiful.  She just shook her 
head.  &quot;We&#39;ll find it later...&quot; 


	Christmas was the Next Morning.  After all, it couldn&#39;t be the 
Next Night, because then you would have skipped the Next Morning 
anyway, thereby acknowledge the existence of Next Morning anyway.  And 
you couldn&#39;t go back to the Previous Morning and call it Next Morning, 
or Next Morning would be just about the time that Akane Tendo woke up 
and decided she had to tell Ranma Saotome her biggest Secret of all.  
	That she was terribly attracted to him, even when Him was a She.  
	And, if Previous Morning was called Next Morning, Ranma Saotome 
would still be fretting that he may have to FUBAR Akane Tendo that Next 
Night, and FUBAR their relationship by moving too fast into the family 
stages.  

	So, because Akane Tendo only now had smaller, less dangerous 
Secrets to tell, it was most definitely Next Morning.  
	And because Ranma Saotome had not needed to FUBAR Akane, even 
with their raging hormones, it was definitely Next Morning.

	But, the Tendo and Saotome families were short two people when it 
was time to open presents that Next Morning.  Had anyone been more 
interested in finding those two missing people instead of opening their 
clock radios and fuzzy Rudolph sweaters, they may have found something 
interesting on their way past the Dojo.

	The soft, sweet sounds of Ranma and Akane&#39;s lovemaking.  A soft 
cry, muffled by a heated kiss...one of many dozen from that night&#39;s 
activities.  Both Ranma and Akane&#39;s cries of passion.  After...perhaps 
even a content, tiny laugh and a long, satisfied sigh as each finally 
drifted off to sleep in each other&#39;s arms, covered only by a makeshift 
bed and their combined sweat.  


	As Akane turned to Ranma, who was near sleep and exhausted from 
his first time reaching orgasm as a woman.  A few times.  She smiled to 
herself, looking at her finance.  &quot;Ranma?&quot;
	&quot;Mmm?&quot; she replied, gently nuzzling into Akane&#39;s stomach, tracing 
little patterns on her side with her finger.  
	Akane allowed herself a wicked smile.  &quot;What are you doing for 
New Years Eve?&quot;

	Ranma&#39;s eyes shot open.
