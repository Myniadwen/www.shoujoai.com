<h1>Black Rose, Blue Thunder (part 10 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/blakrose-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>	&quot;Nerima?! Why would we move filming there?!&quot;

	Eyeing his director with calm sandalwood eyes, Ukyo 
wore a slow smile as he said, &quot;Because I want to.&quot;

	While the director was still dealing with their sudden 
relocation, Ukyo moved his eyes to look at the PR staff. He 
stopped, of course, on Yusabe Kuruki, to give her his usual 
heartbreaker smile which she melted at.

	&quot;Kuruki honey,&quot; Ukyo drawled in very sensuous tones. 
&quot;I&#39;d like you to release a statement to the press saying that 
tomorrow we&#39;re going to hold an open audition for the coveted 
role of the next Peal girl in my newest movie.&quot;

	Upon hearing this, the director Yusabe Kensuke, could 
only moan again before he started hitting his head on the 
conference table over and over.

	&quot;An open audition,&quot; Kensuke sobbed. &quot;Don&#39;t you know 
how many rejects and losers are going to show up? How can you 
do this to me, Ukyo-kun?&quot;

	&quot;The same way that you can ask me to do all of those 
damned stupid fan service poses,&quot; Ukyo replied. &quot;It&#39;s going to 
bring in the people. Just stop and think about it, Kensuke. Who 
wouldn&#39;t want to see the latest Bakers Peal flick when they learn 
the female lead is somebody like them? Just a plain and ordinary 
girl off the street that was hand picked by yours truly?&quot;

	Kensuke slowly lifted his head and looked at Ukyo with 
eyes shining with tears. &quot;The Kami above,&quot; he said in soft 
wonderment. He suddenly jumped to his feet and broke into a 
wide smile while he exclaimed, &quot;You&#39;re becoming more shrewd 
than me! I&#39;m so proud!&quot;

	&quot;Thanks, Ken,&quot; said Ukyo with a chuckle before he gave 
Kuruki a wink which she blushed at. &quot;So it&#39;s all settled then? 
Kuruki releases the statement to the press today and tomorrow we 
hold the auditions. That clear?&quot;

	&quot;Crystal,&quot; the room full of various movie executives and 
employees all echoed at the same time.

	&quot;Wonderful,&quot; Ukyo said. He then turned on his heel to 
stride out of the conference room with a graceful elegance.

	When they were alone, Kensuke looked at his wife and 
frowning a bit, he asked, &quot;Do you always have to blush when he&#39;s 
around? He is half your age, you know.&quot;

	&quot;I know,&quot; said Kuruki as she gave a wistful sigh. &quot;But he&#39;s 
still Ukyo. The sexiest man to ever hit the silver screen in the past 
twenty years according to Kung Fu Daily.&quot;	

	Heaving an exasperated sigh, Kensuke shook his head and 
wondered why after two years of working on Kung Fu films with 
him, his wife could still have a school girl crush on Ukyo.

	Couldn&#39;t she see that he was imperious and often times 
overconfident? Couldn&#39;t she see that he needlessly risked his life 
on movie stunts? Couldn&#39;t she see that he was a guy with 
problems?

	Or maybe, Kuruki could see all of those things and they 
only made her like him more for some strange reason.

	But he didn&#39;t let it bother him because if there was one 
thing in the world that Kensuke accepted hands down it was the 
fact that women were drawn to Ukyo like flies to honey.

	After all, what could anyone really expect when a sixteen 
year old was voted the sexiest man alive?

	Taking Ryoga&#39;s hand as she stepped off of the bus as they 
finally reached their stop, Nabiki said, &quot;Next time we&#39;re definitely 
taking the train, Ryoga-kun.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ryoga said with a nod. &quot;What was with that green 
haired guy who kept babbling about the lost continent of Atlantis 
to his pouch bag anyway? And why the heck would anyone name 
their bag Rane?&quot;

	&quot;Beats me,&quot; said Nabiki with a sigh. &quot;But buses aren&#39;t my 
means of public transport anymore.&quot;

	Smiling at this, Ryoga started a walk down the crowded 
streets of downtown Nerima and towards the Tendo dojo with 
Nabiki at his side. &quot;But at least we had a good time in Yokohama,&quot; 
remarked Ryoga. &quot;The owner of the Karaoke Citadel even gave 
us that invitation to come back and sing professionally.&quot;

	&quot;Now that&#39;s an idea,&quot; said Nabiki as she smiled. &quot;I 
wouldn&#39;t mind getting paid for singing. Would you?&quot;

	&quot;Well,&quot; said Ryoga slowly. &quot;It does sound like fun. And 
Ranma always says never to pass up the opportunity to make easy 
money when you can.&quot;

	 &quot;Then it&#39;s decided,&quot; Nabiki said with satisfaction. &quot;I&#39;ll call 
Rutaka-san when we get home and tell him that we accept his 
offer to sing there next weekend. We can even promote around 
school since the other students who saw us singing before seemed 
to enjoy our performance.&quot;

	&quot;Great,&quot; Ryoga beamed. &quot;I can&#39;t wait, Nabiki-chan. 
Whenever I&#39;m with you I always have lots of fun.&quot;

	While Nabiki blushed at this, Ryoga directed his eyes 
across the street only to blink at what he saw. &quot;Hey,&quot; Ryoga said 
slowly. &quot;Isn&#39;t that Ranma?&quot;

	&quot;And Dachi,&quot; continued Nabiki. &quot;They&#39;re probably up to 
their necks in trouble again.&quot;

	&quot;I dunno,&quot; Ryoga mused. &quot;They have Shampoo and the 
Matriarch with them.&quot; He paused to squint then said, &quot;I wonder 
why Tachi is in his cursed form though.&quot;

	&quot;Cursed form?&quot; Nabiki blinked. She looked closer at the 
group but only unusual thing that she could see was Shampoo 
holding an odd looking chicken. &quot;You mean that weird bird is 
actually Tatewaki in his cursed form?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Ryoga. &quot;He fell into the spring of drowned 
phoenix. It&#39;s a very tragic story.&quot;

	Holding back the urge to snicker, Nabiki took Ryoga&#39;s 
hand in her own and crossed the street as she called out, &quot;Ranma! 
Dachi! What&#39;re you up to?&quot;

	&quot;Throw a cannonball at my beautiful face, will he? I&#39;ll show 
him,&quot; Ranma was muttering to herself when she paused on hearing 
Nabiki&#39;s voice. She turned to look at the approaching pair and 
said, &quot;Hey. Where have you two been? Out on another date?&quot;

	&quot;Maybe,&quot; said Nabiki slyly as she smiled at Ryoga who 
immediately turned bright red at this. Looking back at Ranma, she 
asked, &quot;Why aren&#39;t you guys at school?&quot;

	&quot;We got kicked out,&quot; said Ranma easily. &quot;Because the old 
ghoul&#39;s amulet kept zapping us in class.&quot;

	&quot;Kept zapping you. I never received the blunt of the 
amulet&#39;s odd form of discipline,&quot; Kodachi reminded.
	
	&quot;Me, you, it&#39;s all the same, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Ranma flashed a 
charming smile then drawled, &quot;After all, you do have my heart and 
that makes me a part of you, Dachi.&quot;

	&quot;Naturally,&quot; Kodachi purred before she moved closer and 
they began yet another involved kiss.

	Quirking an eyebrow at the couple, Nabiki turned to 
Shampoo and asked, &quot;How about you? Why are you out running 
around loose? This an Amazon holiday?&quot;

	&quot;No,&quot; said Shampoo with a sniff. &quot;Shampoo asked to 
leave school when she beat up mob of many stupid boys and sent 
them into hospital. But is only for two days then Principal let 
Shampoo come back to play basketball.&quot;

	&quot;Ehh, I see,&quot; Nabiki twitched at this reply.

	Giving his high pitched laugh, Ryoga rubbed the back of 
his head and said, &quot;I&#39;m sure that those guys won&#39;t go near you 
again, Shampoo. That sounds pretty scary.&quot;

	&quot;Really?&quot; Shampoo blinked. &quot;Shampoo was only doing 
what is being taught in tribe about challenges.&quot;

	&quot;Like Ryoga-kun said, that&#39;s scary,&quot; said Nabiki wryly 
who shook her head while smiling at her iinazuke.

	&quot;Very,&quot; Ryoga returned the smile. He lowered his head to 
look directly into Tatewaki phoenix&#39;s beady black gaze. &quot;But why 
are you in your cursed form, Tachi? Did it rain while we were 
sightseeing in Yokohama?&quot;

	For a reply, Tatewaki phoenix puffed up then tilted his 
head back to look up at Shampoo as he squawked. The Amazon 
nodded her head, then lifted Tatewaki phoenix to hold him in front 
of Ranma who formed an annoyed face.

	Backing away slowly, Ranma said,  &quot;You&#39;re not--&quot;

	Before Ranma could go to far, Tatewaki phoenix let loose 
a deafening squawk before he pecked Ranma on the forehead 
several times while Ranma tried to push the enraged bird away as 
it kept pecking her.

	And watching this, Ryoga could only sweatdrop and laugh 
nervously. &quot;Oh, I see,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;Ranma was the one who 
caused you to change forms.&quot;

	&quot;Shampoo,&quot; said Cologne who&#39;s voice cut through the air 
to serve much like a calming influence. &quot;Did you by any chance 
place Tatewaki, while in his cursed form, on top of your head 
when you battled those boys at school?&quot;

	&quot;Yes, was only place Shampoo could think of that was 
safe for Tachi at the time,&quot; Shampoo replied in slight confusion. 
&quot;Why you ask, Great Grandmother?&quot;

	&quot;And Tatewaki turns into a phoenix, correct?&quot; asked 
Cologne as she continued to study the bird in her Great 
Granddaughter&#39;s arms very closely.

	&quot;Yeah, he does,&quot; Ryoga answered first. &quot;But what does 
that have to do with anything?&quot;

	&quot;Kuno-san,&quot; murmured Cologne who hopped forward to 
gaze into his eyes. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me you possess such a truly 
influential and unique form?&quot;

	At this statement, Tatewaki phoenix could only blink 
before he puffed up some more and wore a face of definite 
puzzlement. Cologne turned to look at Shampoo and said, &quot;Come. 
We should be getting back if all of you want to know the exact 
nature of Tatewaki&#39;s curse.&quot;

	&quot;Well, that don&#39;t interest me any,&quot; Ranma snorted. &quot;I 
already know that idiot Kuno turns into an ugly chicken. I&#39;m just 
gonna head back to the dojo then.&quot;

	Tatewaki phoenix puffed up again and looked like he was 
going to peck Ranma, when Kodachi reached out to grab Ranma 
by the top of her pointy ears then started to drag her down the 
street and past the others.

	&quot;Augh! Dachi, that hurts!&quot;

	&quot;I asked you not to insult my brother, darling.&quot;

	&quot;But he turns into a chicken, Dachi!&quot;

	&quot;He&#39;s a phoenix, not a chicken.&quot;

	&quot;Maybe, but he still looks like a chicken.&quot;

	&quot;Darling...&quot;

	&quot;Augh! My ears!&quot;

	And watching this entire scene, the group could only wear 
faces of surprised wariness.

	&quot;Well,&quot; said Nabiki after a long moment. &quot;I guess even 
those two have the occasional relationship problem.&quot;

	&quot;It was bound to happen,&quot; said Ryoga dimly.

	&quot;I&#39;m just glad that it isn&#39;t us,&quot; Nabiki said as she flashed him 
another smile which caused Ryoga to blush.

	Ryoga was about to reply but found himself cut off when 
Ranma wailed, &quot;He looks like a chicken, Dachi!&quot;

	Sweatdropping again, Ryoga looked at Nabiki then said 
firmly, &quot;I agree. I&#39;m really glad that it isn&#39;t us.&quot;

---

	&quot;Right hand, blue.&quot;

	Her head resting directly in front of the valley of Akane&#39;s 
breasts, Chocolate dimly heard the words of the other girl but they 
barely registered in her mind.

	&quot;What?&quot; asked Chocolate.

	&quot;Right hand, blue,&quot; Akane replied with a smile as she 
looked down at Chocolate which left their lips only a few inches 
apart, causing the Amazon more distraction.

	&quot;Oh, okay,&quot; Chocolate mumbled as she turned an 
interesting shade of red.

	Shifting her body, Chocolate now found herself in a 
strange bridge like position that left her trapped under Akane with 
their faces extremely close together.

	It was at this point that Chocolate wished she had paid a 
little more attention when Akane was listing off the various games 
that they could play to pass the time.

	Trying her very best to ignore the light scent of flowers that 
clung to Akane, Chocolate thought back on how she had ended 
up in this position.

	Apparently the whole idea of handcuffing her to stop her 
from running away wasn&#39;t Akane&#39;s but rather an odd Doctor&#39;s who 
worked at Akane&#39;s school. It was this same Doctor who had the 
key to the handcuffs. And since Akane didn&#39;t know where he lived 
they would have to stay handcuffed together until they saw him 
tomorrow.

	The way in which Akane had told Chocolate the story 
along with the apologetic and anxious look she held in her gaze 
kept Chocolate from getting angry with her.

	Chocolate, like nearly everyone else, found it impossible to 
get angry with someone as kawaii and sweet natured as Akane.

	But Chocolate could get angry at this Doctor person and 
when she went to see him tomorrow she was definitely going to 
give him a piece of her mind. After she dropped a few dozen 
cannonballs on him, of course.

	After she discovered the reason behind being handcuffed, 
Chocolate decided that it would be best to get out of the public 
eye. That was when she asked Akane if they could go to her 
house and relax in private.

	After giving Chocolate a short tour of the house, which 
was empty except for two men drunk on sake who kept talking 
about Hibiki Nabiki, they ended up in Akane&#39;s room. While 
Chocolate tried nervously to avoid looking at the messiness of the 
room, as it had bras and undies strewn all around, Akane listed off 
several games to play.

	And not listening closely, Chocolate mumbled a low yes 
when the game Twister was mentioned because it sounded vaguely 
familiar to her.

	It seems even in the great wilderness of China teenagers 
have heard about the game called Twister.

	Now in a much stranger position, which implied a sexual 
maneuver that she recalled being referred to as a sixty-nine, 
Chocolate wished she&#39;d known just what the game entailed before 
she agreed to play it with Akane.

	&quot;Chocolate? You okay?&quot;

	Twisting her head around from where it had been hovering 
just above Akane&#39;s crotch, Chocolate formed a wary smile and 
said, &quot;Couldn&#39;t be better.&quot;
	
	&quot;Good! Left foot, green.&quot;

	Heaving another sigh, Chocolate started to slowly move 
her body into position as she wondered if this game had originally 
been used as a torture device.

	If it was, she would hardly be surprised because right now 
Chocolate was in her very own personal hell.

	One that Shampoo would find amusing, no doubt.

---

	&quot;You see,&quot; Cologne said. She set down a thick book on 
the dusty countertop that resided in the near empty room to the 
building she bought. &quot;Tatewaki turns into the legendary phoenix of 
our mountain home. While in his cursed form, if he&#39;s placed on a 
warrior&#39;s head, he will make that warrior invincible in battle.&quot;

	&quot;Really?&quot; asked Ranma. Her cobalt eyes then gained a 
definite gleam. &quot;Maybe you aren&#39;t so worthless in your chicken 
form,&quot; said Ranma as she slid towards the now human Tatewaki 
who looked at her in disgust.

	Lifting his sheathed katana, Tatewaki promptly whacked 
Ranma on the top of her blonde head with it as he said, &quot;As if I&#39;d 
ever allow you to use me in such a vile manner, Saotome. Do I 
look like a fool to you?&quot;

	Forming a scowl, Ranma looked up at Tatewaki through 
the sheathed katana that rested on her head and said, &quot;You really 
want me to answer that, Kuno?&quot;

	&quot;You guys,&quot; said Ryoga in slightly exasperated tones as he 
stepped between Ranma and Tatewaki. &quot;Don&#39;t start again. Haven&#39;t 
you fought enough for one day?&quot;

	Matching each others hostile gaze, Ranma and Tatewaki 
answered together, &quot;No.&quot;

	While Ryoga heaved a sigh at this, Shampoo said, &quot;So that 
why Shampoo beat up stupid boys easily? Magic of phoenix help 
Shampoo in battle?&quot;

	&quot;Exactly,&quot; said Cologne with a nod. &quot;The power of 
Tatewaki&#39;s cursed form added your own natural skill in battle to 
make you an utterly invincible warrior.&quot;

	&quot;That&#39;s what I call a fighting advantage,&quot; Nabiki remarked. 
She then turned to watch as Ryoga tried in vain to keep Ranma 
and Tatewaki from fighting.

	&quot;Most certainly,&quot; said Kodachi softly. Her violet eyes held 
concern as she gazed at the form of her older brother. &quot;If people 
of lax morals were to find out about Tachi&#39;s curse it wouldn&#39;t bode 
well for him. They might use him in obscene ways.&quot;

	Snorting at this, Perfume took a step forward to join the 
group as she had been hanging back with Kasumi on the edge of 
the discussion before. &quot;You mean people like you, demon thief?&quot; 
Perfume asked derisively. 

	&quot;No,&quot; Kodachi said tightly as her jaw tightened. &quot;That&#39;s not 
what I meant at all. I may do many things that waver on the illegal 
but I would never use Tachi.&quot;

	Perfume looked like she was going to make another 
derisive comment when Kasumi quietly sidled up next to her and 
gently rested a hand on her back.

	&quot;Perfume,&quot; said Kasumi in softly enchanting tones. &quot;I think 
that it&#39;s time I head back home to get dinner ready. Would you 
mind walking me there?&quot;

	Slowly looking from Kodachi to Kasumi and blinking on 
seeing her Airen&#39;s warm smile, Perfume said, &quot;Of course. 
Whatever you want, Airen.&quot;

	With that, the two women left the building and watching 
their exit, Nabiki said, &quot;It looks like my Oneechan has Perfume 
wrapped around her little finger.&quot;

	&quot;Perfume is whipped,&quot; Shampoo agreed with a nod and a 
snicker. &quot;Shampoo never see her like this before. Except when she 
turn into very cute pixie. Is easy to get Perfume to do things when 
she like that.&quot;

	&quot;Pixie?&quot; repeated Kodachi and Nabiki, both of whom had 
never encountered Perfume&#39;s pixie form in such a way that they 
would know what it truly was.

	&quot;Yes,&quot; Shampoo said easily. &quot;You not knowing of 
Perfume&#39;s curse? She turn into too too cute pixie. Is odd you not 
know. Sisters Kasumi and Akane both know.&quot;

	As Nabiki formed a thoughtful expression and 
contemplated the idea of splashing Perfume just to see if what 
Shampoo said was true, Kodachi formed a slow smile and 
murmured, &quot;Very interesting.&quot;

	&quot;That&#39;s it, Kuno! Magical chicken or not, we&#39;re gonna fight 
and I&#39;m gonna kick your ass!&quot;

	Turning around, they saw Ranma and Tatewaki both 
unsheathing their katanas again as they bounded out of the building 
to start up their duel once more.

	&quot;Oh dear,&quot; said Kodachi with a sigh. &quot;They really do seem 
to enjoy fighting one another, don&#39;t they?&quot;

	&quot;Ranma! Tachi! Don&#39;t do this!&quot; Ryoga shouted before he 
ran out the building after them.

	Observing this, Nabiki&#39;s hazel eyes widened as she called, 
&quot;No, Ryoga-kun! You&#39;ll get lost!&quot;

	Then Nabiki promptly ran out of the building with 
Shampoo hot on her heels as the Amazon hoped to watch 
Tatewaki utterly defeat Ranma in a fair battle.

	This left Kodachi alone with Cologne. Wearing a quirky 
smile, Kodachi bowed and said, &quot;It seems as if I too must also 
take my leave, Matriarch. But before I go may I ask a question?&quot;

	&quot;Certainly, Kuno-san,&quot; replied Cologne.

	&quot;Does Ranma darling truly have to be in his elfin form 
constantly to learn magics from you or were you just trying to 
annoy him by trapping him so?&quot; asked Kodachi.

	Her eyes narrowing by a notch, Cologne gave a soft laugh 
and said, &quot;You are clever, aren&#39;t you? The latter of course. Ranma 
can only learn magics as an elf but to do so he hardly needs to 
remain trapped as one. But it seems that it&#39;s not having the desired 
effect on him.&quot;

	&quot;I see,&quot; Kodachi said in low tones. Tilting her head to one 
side, she said, &quot;Then may I further inquire for you to teach me how 
to return my dearest to normal?&quot;

	Studying Kodachi closely, Cologne turned around on her 
staff and hopping away, she said, &quot;Come with me.&quot;

	Following after the Matriarch, Kodachi prepared to learn 
the first of many Amazon secrets.

	Secrets that she would make good use of.

	Ukyo looked at the row of clothes that he had laid out on 
his bed and said, &quot;What to pack?&quot; Glancing up at the figure of his 
best friend who was lounging on the plush window sill, he held up 
a blue pinstripe suit. &quot;What do you think? Should I pack suits or 
dress casual?&quot;

	Turning from where he&#39;d been looking out the window and 
at the busy cityscape below, Kurenai Tsubasa sighed before he 
rose to his feet and crossed to Ukyo.

	&quot;Why do you even care, Ucchan?&quot; asked Tsubasa. He sat 
down at the edge of the bed and said, &quot;It&#39;s not like we&#39;re shooting 
anywhere big. It&#39;s just a tiny district.&quot;

	&quot;No,&quot; Ukyo said softly as he continued to gaze at his 
wardrobe on the bed. &quot;It&#39;s more than that. It&#39;s special.&quot;

	Rolling his eyes, Tsubasa removed a stray piece of lint 
from the tailored pants he wore and said, &quot;If you say so. 
Personally, I still can&#39;t figure out why you wanted to move 
shooting.&quot;

	&quot;A little elf told me too,&quot; said Ukyo with a smirk.

	&quot;What?&quot; Tsubasa asked.

	&quot;Never mind,&quot; Ukyo dismissed. He turned to remove a 
leather suitcase from his closet and said, &quot;The reason I moved 
shooting to Nerima is because I was told some old acquaintances 
of mine are there. Acquaintances that I&#39;d like to see again.&quot;

	&quot;Oh?&quot; Tsubasa arched an chestnut eyebrow curiously as 
he folded his arms across his muscular chest that was well revealed 
in his tight white t-shirt. &quot;The same acquaintances that we&#39;ve 
discussed in the past?&quot;

	&quot;The very same,&quot; said Ukyo. Turning to look at Tsubasa, 
he formed a dangerously rakish smile then said, &quot;And you know 
how I feel about them, sugar.&quot;

	Chuckling at this, Tsubasa rose to his feet and said, &quot;They 
will definitely be in the hospital when you&#39;re finished with them, 
Ucchan. But what about the press?&quot;

	&quot;What about them?&quot; replied Ukyo carelessly as he began 
to neatly pack up several different suits. &quot;I&#39;m hardly known for my 
indiscretion, Basa. I&#39;ll keep things quiet.&quot;

	&quot;Well, then,&quot; Tsubasa said with a smirk. &quot;Do you mind if I 
help you out? I could use the work out.&quot;

	Pausing in his packing, Ukyo looked up with surprised 
eyes. &quot;Basa,&quot; he began slowly. &quot;You don&#39;t have to do that.&quot;

	&quot;Have to? What do you mean? I want to,&quot; said Tsubasa 
casually but his blue eyes were earnest. &quot;You&#39;re my best friend in 
whole the world and my favorite co-star. What sorta guy would I 
be if I let you do this alone?&quot;

	&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Ukyo softly. &quot;But this is something that I 
have to handle on my own. I do appreciate the offer though. It 
means a lot to me.&quot;

	&quot;No problem,&quot; Tsubasa replied. He then strode across the 
room and sat down in one of the chairs before he turned on the 
television. After a moment, he said, &quot;It looks like Kuruki got to the 
press. They&#39;re already talking about the shooting change and open 
audition on the tube.&quot;

	&quot;Good,&quot; Ukyo said. Folding the last of his clothes in the 
suitcase, he said, &quot;Hallucination or not I have to see if it&#39;s true. I 
have to see if he&#39;s really in Nerima.&quot;

	Closing the suitcase with an almost ominous click, Ukyo 
clenched his jaw and said, &quot;Ryoga. Just wait. I&#39;ll get my revenge on 
you and your damned father.&quot;

---

	&quot;Honestly,&quot; said Nabiki as she stepped over the passed 
out forms of Genma and Soun. &quot;Who drinks this early in the day? 
What on earth were they thinking?&quot;

	The group was now back at the dojo and they had all split 
apart to do their various chores. Perfume helping Kasumi to 
prepare dinner while Shampoo and Tatewaki were in the dojo 
sparring again.

	This left Nabiki, Ryoga, and Ranma in the sitting room 
observing the evidence of Genma and Soun&#39;s drinking binge. The 
most glaring of which was their unconscious and snoring forms on 
the floor. That and the sake bottles strewn everywhere.

	Heaving a sigh, Nabiki said, &quot;They even left the television 
on. What a waste of electricity.&quot; 

	&quot;They were probably celebrating your date,&quot; Ranma 
remarked as she smirked at Ryoga. &quot;Don&#39;t you agree, big bro? Or 
should I call you the date master now?&quot;

	&quot;Don&#39;t push it, Ranma,&quot; growled Ryoga before he shot a 
nervous look at Nabiki who was in front of the television.

	Ranma was about to reply when she felt hot breath hit her 
skin causing her to shiver. Looking back, she gazed into Kodachi&#39;s 
violet eyes and immediately smiled.

	&quot;Dachi,&quot; said Ranma. &quot;I was wondering where you&#39;d gone 
off to. You just disappeared on us. Kuno almost went to look for 
you but Shampoo got him distracted.&quot;

	&quot;I was discovering secrets,&quot; replied Kodachi coyly as she 
ran her fingers up Ranma&#39;s ribcage. &quot;Ones that will greatly benefit 
us both, my darling.&quot;

	&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; Ranma asked curiously. &quot;What sort--&quot;

	Ranma started to say something more, but got cut off 
when Nabiki said breathlessly, &quot;No way.&quot;

	Everyone turned to look at the middle Tendo sister who 
was crouched in front of the television, her eyes glued to the 
screen as she wore an enraptured expression.

	&quot;Nabiki-chan?&quot; asked Ryoga in concern as he took a step 
towards her. &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

	Instead of replying, Nabiki moved forward and turned up 
the television volume so all the others could hear what she was 
listening to.

	&quot;So, that&#39;s the latest scoop in the Kung Fu world. Kuonji 
Ukyo, entertainment superstar, will be filming his new movie in the 
Bakers Peal series, On the Emperor&#39;s Secret Sauce, in the Nerima 
district. All of you would be starlets don&#39;t forget that tomorrow in 
downtown Nerima is when the open auditions for the role of the 
latest Peal girl will being going on. Good luck!&quot;

	&quot;Ukyo?&quot; said Kodachi so softly that no one could hear.

	Mechanically turning off the television, Nabiki turned 
around to stare at them all as she whispered, &quot;Ukyo is coming 
here. He&#39;s really coming here.&quot;

	And before anyone could comment on this or her strange 
behavior, Nabiki leapt to her feet and then ran out of the sitting 
room as she shouted, &quot;He&#39;s coming here!&quot;

	Blinking at this, Ryoga, Ranma, and Kodachi got over 
their mutual shock and went after Nabiki who was in her room and 
standing in front of her closet.

	&quot;Nabchan?&quot; asked Ranma. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;

	Nabiki looked back at the others and they saw her hazel 
eyes were sparkling as she said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry... but this is just so 
exciting for me. You see, I love Kung Fu movies. I have ever since 
Mother took me to one before she died.&quot;

	&quot;Nabiki dearest is a Kung Fu fan?&quot; Kodachi said in 
obvious shock. &quot;That is most... unexpected.&quot;

	&quot;But what does that have to do with what was on the 
television?&quot; asked Ryoga with confusion.

	&quot;Kuonji Ukyo is the biggest Kung Fu star in the world right 
now,&quot; Nabiki said enthusiastically. &quot;And my favorite movie actor. 
He&#39;s just so... so... Ukyo.&quot;

	&quot;Looks like you got competition, bro,&quot; Ranma said as she 
elbowed Ryoga and snickered.

	&quot;Funny,&quot; retorted Ryoga. He turned his eyes back to 
Nabiki who was opening her closet and revealed several large 
rows filled from top to bottom with videos.

	&quot;Goodness,&quot; Kodachi said as she took a step towards 
Nabiki and peered at the videos. &quot;You do have a lot of them.&quot;

	&quot;Well, I&#39;ve been collecting them since I was about twelve,&quot; 
said Nabiki somewhat sheepishly.

	&quot;Do all of these have that Ukyo guy in them?&quot; asked 
Ryoga as he suddenly appeared at Nabiki&#39;s side along with Ranma 
who was looking at the videos.

	&quot;I wish,&quot; Nabiki said with a wistful sigh. &quot;But he&#39;s only 
made ten movies. Ukyo&#39;s our age, he&#39;s sixteen.&quot;

	Taking one of the videos off the shelf, Ranma studied its 
cover and read aloud, &quot;Cook Hard. The latest action packed 
adventure from Kuonji Ukyo. What happens when you mix a 
former chef turned cop with a terrorist? A recipe for trouble.&quot;

	&quot;That&#39;s a great movie,&quot; commented Nabiki. &quot;But I like the 
Okonomiyaki Jones trilogy or the Bakers Peal series best.&quot;

	Staring at the video she held, Ranma said, &quot;Kuonji Ukyo. I 
just know I&#39;ve heard that name before.&quot;

	&quot;He is famous, Ranma,&quot; said Nabiki in slightly exasperated 
tones. &quot;Last year alone his movies brought in more than sixty billion 
yen on the international market.&quot;

	&quot;Yes,&quot; Kodachi murmured. &quot;He&#39;s very famous.&quot;

	&quot;It ain&#39;t that,&quot; Ranma said as she frowned. She turned to 
look at Ryoga and said, &quot;Take a look at this guy, bro. Doesn&#39;t he 
look awfully familiar to you?&quot;

	Gazing at the video, Ryoga said thoughtfully, &quot;Now that 
you mention it, he does look sort of familiar.&quot;

	The two brothers stared at the video together while 
Kodachi looked at Nabiki and asked, &quot;Will you be attending the 
auditions tomorrow, Nabiki dearest? It does seem as if your 
precious Ukyo will be supervising the event.&quot;

	&quot;Me? Audition to be in a movie with Ukyo?&quot; Nabiki 
turned bright red at the thought. &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;

	&quot;Oh come now,&quot; Kodachi wheedled as she smoothly 
crossed to stand at Nabiki&#39;s side. Leaning on the other girl&#39;s 
shoulder she purred, &quot;With your beauty and charm I&#39;m positive 
that you&#39;ll be a shoe in for the role. And I&#39;d be more than willing to 
help you prepare.&quot;

	Snapping out of her momentary daze, Nabiki looked at 
Kodachi and asked, &quot;What&#39;re you up to, Dachi?&quot;

	&quot;Up to? Moi?&quot; asked Kodachi with an innocent expression 
as she pressed a hand to her chest. &quot;Why would you even suspect 
that I was up to something?&quot;

	&quot;Because your lips are moving,&quot; replied Nabiki dryly. 
Folding her arms over her chest she said, &quot;Come on, spill it. What 
are you up to this time?&quot;

	&quot;Nothing really,&quot; said Kodachi with a smile. &quot;I merely wish 
to help your achieve your wish of meeting Ukyo. But if you happen 
to win the part of his on screen paramour I would be much obliged 
if you would consider making me your official representative.&quot;

	&quot;Representative?&quot; echoed Nabiki. &quot;You mean that you 
want to be my agent? Why would you want to do that?&quot;

	&quot;My dearest Nabiki,&quot; said Kodachi sensuously as she 
cupped Nabiki&#39;s cheek softly. &quot;The tales of your skill in singing 
have not escaped my notice. It&#39;s obvious you have the looks and 
talent to make it but do you have the ability to maintain the needed 
ruthlessness to boost your career?&quot;

	&quot;And you do?&quot; Nabiki asked drolly.

	&quot;Of course,&quot; said Kodachi with a smile. &quot;There&#39;s no doubt 
that you could represent yourself but do you really have the time or 
energy? Besides,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;I&#39;ve done it once before 
with much success.&quot;

	&quot;What did you say?&quot; asked Nabiki.

	&quot;Nothing,&quot; Kodachi said as she gave a charming smile. 
Curling her fingers around the back of Nabiki&#39;s neck she said, 
&quot;What do you say, Nabiki dearest? Can I assume that I&#39;m now 
your official business representative?&quot;

	Gazing into Kodachi&#39;s eyes, Nabiki sighed and shaking her 
head, she said, &quot;Sure. What&#39;s the worse that can happen?&quot;

	&quot;That&#39;s it! That&#39;s who he is!&quot;

	Turning their heads, Kodachi and Nabiki looked at Ranma 
and Ryoga who wore identical expressions of pure triumph as they 
stared at the video that Ranma held.

	&quot;That&#39;s who, who is?&quot; asked Nabiki.

	&quot;Ukyo!&quot; exclaimed Ranma with a smirk. &quot;Me and Ryoga 
finally figured out where we know him from!&quot;

	&quot;From the movies, of course,&quot; said Nabiki as she shot a 
wry smile at Kodachi who returned it.

	&quot;No, we knew him before that,&quot; Ryoga said as he smiled 
gently at Nabiki. &quot;We were friends with him when we were little. 
We met him when we stopped outside of Kyoto on our first 
training journey when we were six.&quot;

	&quot;I was good pals with him,&quot; Ranma beamed. She looked 
at the video again and said, &quot;He almost turned out more studly than 
me. Who would&#39;ve thought?&quot;

	&quot;Wow,&quot; said Nabiki in amazement. &quot;You both should 
come with me tomorrow when I audition and see if he still 
remembers you. It might even help my odds for winning.&quot;

	&quot;Audition?&quot; asked Ryoga. &quot;You mean you&#39;re going to try 
out for that role in the movie, Nabiki? That&#39;s great! I just know 
you&#39;ll get the part! Especially if you sing.&quot;

	&quot;You really think so?&quot; Nabiki blushed.

	&quot;I do,&quot; replied Ryoga as he gave a vigorous nod. &quot;Your 
voice is just as pretty as your looks. When they see and hear them 
both together you&#39;re sure to win.&quot;

	&quot;Thanks, Ryoga-kun,&quot; said Nabiki softly. &quot;What do you 
think about that, Dachi?&quot; She paused on seeing the look of 
surprise frozen on Kodachi&#39;s face. &quot;Dachi?&quot;

	Kodachi looked at Nabiki and laughed rather weakly as 
she said, &quot;That&#39;s most opportune news, Nabiki darling. That yet 
another person knows Ukyo in such an intimate manner.&quot;

	After saying this, Kodachi walked out of the room to leave 
Nabiki puzzled as she said, &quot;Another person?&quot;

---

	Strange noises were coming from Akane&#39;s bedroom.

	At least they sounded strange to Ryoga.

	He pondered the sounds but shrugged as he reminded 
himself that he was supposed to tell Akane it was time for dinner.

	So slowly raising up his hand, Ryoga lightly rapped on 
Akane&#39;s bedroom door.

	When no answer came, Ryoga scratched the back of his 
head before he knocked on the door a bit harder.

	No answer came.

	This gave Ryoga one last option as he knocked on the 
door even harder and for the third time. 

	But still, no answer came.

	Frowning at this, Ryoga narrowed his eyes and pondered 
on what he should do now. After a few seconds, he decided that 
he had to use his final strategy.

	He knocked on the door for the fourth time then paused 
before he carefully opened it and said, &quot;Akane?&quot;

	There was, of course, no answer but that hardly mattered 
as Ryoga was frozen because of what he saw.

	And what Ryoga saw was Akane and Chocolate in the 
middle of their Twister game, in a very compromising position that 
implied some rather naughty things.

	Of course the naughty things were accentuated by the fact 
that Akane happened to be kissing a dazed Chocolate.

	Ryoga&#39;s reaction was somewhat predictable.

	He slowly backed out of the bedroom, closed the door, 
then promptly fainted in the middle of the hallway.

	 Somehow, no one found this unusual.

---

	&quot;Perfect,&quot; Kodachi purred. &quot;Simply perfect.&quot;

	Looking at herself in the full length mirror, Nabiki eyed the 
sleek blue silk dress she had on that had a slit up the side of her 
right leg and said, &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot;

	&quot;Nabiki dearest,&quot; said Kodachi with a sigh. &quot;You must 
listen to me when I say you&#39;re a desirable woman. If you wear this 
or anything similar you&#39;ll be an instant hit. It is the age of the 
modern woman but it never hurts to use the natural advantages that 
one is blessed with to excel.&quot;

	&quot;If you say so,&quot; said Nabiki skeptically. She looked at 
Kodachi with a very unsure gaze. &quot;Do you really think that I&#39;m 
desirable, Dachi?&quot;

	At this question, Kodachi began laughing in lively chuckles. 
Raising an eyebrow, Nabiki put her hands on her hips and 
demanded, &quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;ve flirted with you time and time again,&quot; said Kodachi 
through her laughter as she wiped her eyes. &quot;I give you daily 
compliments, and numerous signs I find you both physically and 
mentally attractive, but still you can ask me if I truly find you 
desirable?&quot;

	&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; Nabiki groused as she smiled despite 
herself. &quot;I admit it was a dumb thing to ask.&quot;

	&quot;Extremely dumb,&quot; Kodachi said while her violet eyes 
darkened. Crossing the room, she stood in front of Nabiki and 
tipped her head upwards. &quot;But I shall answer your query. I think 
you&#39;re very desirable, Nabiki.&quot;

	Blushing light red, Nabiki said softly, &quot;Thank you, Dachi. 
No one has ever said that to me before.&quot;

	&quot;Indeed?&quot; Kodachi quirked an eyebrow. &quot;And you are not 
disappointed that this compliment came from not a man you long 
for but a woman who is your friend?&quot;

	&quot;No,&quot; said Nabiki with a smile. &quot;I don&#39;t mind at all.&quot;

	Studying Nabiki carefully, Kodachi murmured, &quot;You are a 
curious person, Tendo Nabiki. But I think that is why I&#39;m so very 
fond of you.&quot;

	&quot;I could say the same for you,&quot; Nabiki said smartly. 

	&quot;Touche,&quot; said Kodachi as she gave a light chuckle. Pulling 
away from Nabiki, she said, &quot;I think we&#39;re done with the wardrobe 
assembly for now. Please excuse me as it&#39;s time for me to retire for 
the evening.&quot;

	Watching as Kodachi walked towards her bedroom door, 
Nabiki found herself calling out, &quot;Wait!&quot;

	Pausing in her walk, Kodachi turned back towards Nabiki 
and asked, &quot;Yes, Nabiki dearest?&quot;

	&quot;You can stay here if you want,&quot; said Nabiki a bit shyly as 
she averted her eyes from Kodachi&#39;s.

	Forming a slow smile, Kodachi replied, &quot;While that is 
something I&#39;d enjoy very much I think that it would once again lead 
to you being uncomfortable. Besides,&quot; Kodachi tilted her head to 
one side. &quot;You&#39;re making a rash choice. Ask me again once you&#39;ve 
thought about what it means.&quot;

	&quot;But I didn&#39;t mean--&quot; began Nabiki in protest.

	&quot;Perhaps, perhaps not,&quot; Kodachi interrupted. &quot;But we 
both know how my body and mind works.&quot; She paused to give a 
rather lascivious smile. &quot;Don&#39;t we now?&quot;
		
	Not allowing Nabiki to say anything more, Kodachi then 
opened the bedroom door and exited the room to leave Nabiki 
utterly stunned.

	It was a state of mind that Kodachi was entirely used to 
putting people in.

---
	
	Leaning against Nabiki&#39;s door, Kodachi said, &quot;Why now 
out of all times do I suddenly gain a set of morals?&quot;

	Heaving a deep sigh, Kodachi pushed herself up off the 
door and walked towards Akane&#39;s room. &quot;I cannot be like him. 
Perhaps that&#39;s why,&quot; she said softly.

	Upon opening Akane&#39;s door Kodachi, much like Ryoga, 
stood in shock or heavy surprise at what she saw.

	No longer playing twister, as Akane had long since worn 
Chocolate out, doing what we can never know, the two girls were 
snuggled underneath the covers together.

	Chocolate was sprawled on her back with her chin resting 
lightly on the top of Akane&#39;s head, who was using Chocolate&#39;s 
ample breasts as her own personal pillow.

	Kodachi watched as the Amazon shifted and caused 
Akane to cuddle closer then murmur, &quot;Chocolate.&quot;

	Quietly backing out of the room, Kodachi closed yet 
another door to once again lean back against it.

	In less than a minute she had experienced two very 
sexually arousing situations.

	It&#39;s easy to guess the state that Kodachi&#39;s body and mind 
were in at this point and for her there was only one cure.

	She had to find Ranma.

---

	Kodachi was getting frustrated.

	Her search for Ranma was coming up null and void. She 
had started in the room that he shared with Tatewaki, Ryoga, and 
his father but he wasn&#39;t there. She then searched the sitting room, 
kitchen, attic, furo, dojo, and most recently she had even taken a 
quick look inside of Kasumi&#39;s room.

	But still, no Ranma.

	Kodachi was getting very frustrated.

	That was when it came to her. The one place that she 
hadn&#39;t searched and was the most logical.

	With a mad sort of eagerness, Kodachi dashed out of the 
house to make a high leap and land onto the roof.

	And that&#39;s when she found Ranma.

	Sprawled out on the roof to the dojo, she was covered by 
a small blue blanket and despite her erratic sleeping pattern she 
looked entirely delectable.

	Or at least she did to Kodachi.

	Bounding over to Ranma, the dark gymnast gently set 
down the kettle of hot water she held before she lightly straddled 
the elf girl. Leaning down to rest her face inches from Ranma&#39;s, she 
breathed in the blonde&#39;s heady scent.

	&quot;Time for you to return to normal, darling,&quot; said Kodachi 
softly. She then began to expertly run her hands over Ranma&#39;s 
supple body as she touched certain places with precise and soft 
pressure. Pausing at the final spot which left her hands on Ranma&#39;s 
breasts, Kodachi said, &quot;Amulet of ancient past, this trap of yours 
cannot last, as your Master orders it now to be uncast.&quot;

	Then a strange golden glow surrounded Ranma as the red 
jewel in the amulet shone brightly only to dull a few moments later.

	Leaning forward to grab the tea kettle, Kodachi poured 
some of the hot water on Ranma&#39;s head and was rewarded with 
the sight of Ranma changing back into his male form.

	Unfortunately for Kodachi, the feeling of hot water being 
poured on his head didn&#39;t succeed in waking Ranma up.

	But it didn&#39;t take Kodachi long to find a more pleasant and 
much more interesting way to wake up her sleeping boyfriend.

	A way that was very fortunate for Ranma.

	Very fortunate indeed.
