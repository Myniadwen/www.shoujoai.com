Three Nights

------------------------------------------------

	&quot;Nabiki, I don&#39;t have any money, so there&#39;s no use staying in 
there so long.&quot;

	&quot;You&#39;re assuming that I&#39;m in here only for the money.  
Besides, I enjoy a nice hot bath as much as the next girl.&quot;

	Ranko came upstairs to see Akane standing outside the 
bathroom with an unhappy face.  &quot;Problem?&quot;  she asked.

	&quot;Well, I had planned on taking a bath sometime today, but 
Nabiki is being stubborn.&quot;  Akane answered.

	&quot;Allow me.&quot;  Ranko said and knocked on the door.  &quot;Nabiki, 
love.  It&#39;s me, Your goddess of desire.&quot;

	&quot;Goddess of desire?&quot;  Akane asked.

	&quot;I think it&#39;s cute.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	&quot;Not as cute as she is, though.&quot;  Nabiki said as she opened the 
door.

	Akane was about to enter the bathroom when Ranko stepped 
inside and started to close the door behind her.  &quot;Hey!  What about 
me?&quot;  she yelled.

	&quot;I don&#39;t know.  Ranko, do you think we should let her?&quot;  
Nabiki asked.

	&quot;I suppose we could let her watch.&quot;  Ranko said with a grin.  
&quot;We could give her a demonstration of some of the things she&#39;s been 
asking about all week.&quot;

	Akane blushed.  It was true that she and Ranko had had 
several frank discussions about sex.  She was almost tempted to say 
yes.  &quot;Um...no, that&#39;s okay.&quot;

	&quot;Here.&quot;  Ranko said and handed Akane some money from her 
pocket.  &quot;We may be a while, so go use the public baths.&quot;

	&quot;Okay.&quot;  Akane said.  &quot;Um...have fun, I guess.&quot;

	&quot;You know we will.&quot;  Nabiki said and closed the door.

	After they were sure Akane was gone, Ranko and Nabiki 
broke out in laughter.

	&quot;Did you see the look on her face when I said she could 
watch?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;Yeah.  You could tell that she was seriously considering 
taking us up on the offer.&quot;  Nabiki replied.

	&quot;I could almost hear one half of her brain saying &#39;There&#39;s no 
way I&#39;m going to watch my sister and her lover put on a sex show.&#39; 
and the other half saying &#39;Watch?  I plan on participating.&#39;&quot;  Ranko 
said.

	&quot;Probably the thought of Ranma finding out was the only thing 
holding her back.&quot;  Nabiki said.

	&quot;Speaking of Ranma, have you thought it over yet?&quot;  Ranko 
asked.

	&quot;Yes, and you have my blessings.&quot;  Nabiki replied.  &quot;Kasumi 
on the other hand...&quot;

	&quot;Kasumi&#39;s too old fashioned.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;Besides, I&#39;m 
just doing what she asked.&quot;

	&quot;You know that&#39;s not what she had in mind.&quot;  Nabiki said.

	&quot;True, but if I&#39;m going to help Ranma, it&#39;s going to be my 
way.&quot;

	&quot;Well, since we&#39;re here, we might as well get you cleaned 
up.&quot;  Nabiki said and helped Ranko undress.  Then she pulled off the 
towel she was wearing so they were both naked.

	Ranko placed a bucket under the faucet and was about to fill 
it with cold water when Nabiki grabbed her hand.  &quot;What?&quot;  she 
asked.

	&quot;Let me.&quot;  Nabiki said and filled the bucket with warm water.  
She took the bucket and dumped it over Ranko&#39;s head.

	&quot;So that&#39;s the way you want to be.&quot;  Ranko said, noticing that 
Nabiki didn&#39;t change her into a man.  She reached for the soap when 
Nabiki grabbed her hand again.

	&quot;I said, let me.&quot;  Nabiki said.  She grabbed the soap and 
started working up a lather on Ranko&#39;s body, paying special attention 
to her breasts and between her legs.

	Ranko moaned and raised her hands to return the caresses 
she was receiving.  Nabiki grabbed her hands and forced them back to 
her sides.  Ranko gave her a questioning look.

	&quot;I already washed off.&quot;  Nabiki stated simply.  She took 
another bucket of warm water and rinsed Ranko off.  She then led the 
girl to the furo and climbed in after her, lying back against Ranko.

	&quot;Mmm, that feels good.&quot;  Ranko said, although whether she 
was referring to the hot water or her breasts pressed against Nabiki&#39;s 
back was unknown.  It wasn&#39;t long before her hands ended up in 
Nabiki&#39;s lap, but once again her hands were forced away.

	&quot;I knew it.  You couldn&#39;t even last five minutes.&quot;  Nabiki 
said.  &quot;No self control what so ever.&quot;

	&quot;What do you expect, with a hot body like yours around.&quot;  
Ranko replied.  &quot;But, if you don&#39;t want to.&quot;

	&quot;What I want is you sitting up on the edge of the tub with my 
head between you&#39;re legs.&quot;  Nabiki said.

	&quot;I like the way you think.&quot;  Ranko said as she sat on the edge 
of the furo and spread her legs.

	Nabiki reached out and spread Ranko&#39;s pussy lips apart.  
&quot;Looks like I missed a spot.&quot;

	&quot;I don&#39;t see any washcloths around.&quot;  Ranko said innocently.  
&quot;I guess you&#39;ll have to use something else.&quot;

	Nabiki smiled and started lapping up Ranko&#39;s juices.  Ranko&#39;s 
moans of pleasure told her she was doing a good job.

	Both of them were too caught up in the moment to notice 
someone knocking on the door.

	&quot;I wonder why Akane went to the public baths?&quot;  
Ranma-chan asked herself as she entered the changing room.  She 
assumed that she was alone in the house.  Akane just left, Kasumi 
went shopping, and Soun and Genma were dragged off by a group of 
women complaining that their underwear was stolen.  She didn&#39;t know 
where Nabiki and Ranko were, but if neither of them were taking a 
bath, then they must be off somewhere together.

	Nabiki and Ranko.  Ranma paused in her undressing as the 
thought entered her mind.  Those two seemed to become friends 
awfully quick.  Ranma knew she should be worried, but for who?  
Sure, Nabiki was obviously working on some scam  to extort money 
from Ranko, but Ranma thought that maybe Nabiki was getting in 
over her head.  Of course Ranma cared for her sister deeply, but 
Ranko&#39;s violent mood swings scared her.  One minute you&#39;d be 
entranced by her tomboyish charm, the next minute she&#39;d have a 
dagger to your throat and you&#39;d be praying for a painless death.

	Ranma turned to the mirror and reflexively jumped.  Being 
cursed to turn into a girl was bad enough without having to look like 
her sister too.  She decided that it was time she changed back to a guy 
and opened the inner door the bathroom.

	Ranko was facing the door, but since she was in the middle of 
an orgasm, she wouldn&#39;t have noticed if the Almighty himself walked 
in.  And Nabiki couldn&#39;t see anything because she was busy causing 
said orgasm.

	Ranma was paralyzed by what she saw.  Nabiki and Ranko 
were... They were... To be honest, she wasn&#39;t exactly sure what they 
were doing, but the look on Ranko&#39;s face told her that she was 
enjoying it.  Once she got control of her legs, Ranma stumbled out of 
the bathroom and finally ended up in her room.

	&quot;That was great.&quot;  Ranko said as her orgasm subsided.

	&quot;Well, it wasn&#39;t free.  Now it&#39;s you&#39;re turn.&quot;  Nabiki said with 
a grin that was both attractive and obscene, considering to layer of cum 
on her face.  &quot;Or my turn, depending on your point of view.&quot;

	&quot;Uh, oh.&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;What?&quot;  Nabiki asked and directed her gaze to where Ranko 
was looking.  Both the inner and outer doors to the bathroom were 
wide open.

	&quot;Someone was watching us.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	&quot;&#39;Someone&#39;?  Come on, Ranko, baby.  You know who it 
was.&quot;  Nabiki said.

	&quot;You don&#39;t seem worried.&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;Are you kidding?  This couldn&#39;t have worked better if we 
planned it.&quot;

	&quot;Well, you know him better than I do.&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;That I do.&quot;  Nabiki replied.  &quot;He&#39;s probably in his room 
right now wondering what in the hell he just saw.&quot;

	&quot;What in the hell did I just see?&quot;  Ranma asked herself when 
she caught her breath.  Stupid question, really.  She&#39;d seen enough of 
Hiroshi and Daisuke&#39;s dirty magazines to know that they were having 
sex.  Were they lesbians?

	The whole concept of lesbians confused Ranma.  She couldn&#39;t 
understand how a girl could enjoy having another girl lick her crotch.  
She didn&#39;t even understand how a girl could get aroused by looking at 
naked girls.  Of course that isn&#39;t to say that she didn&#39;t get aroused by 
naked girls, but she was really a guy.

	Ranma felt her pussy start to get wet.  All this thinking about 
sex was starting to get to her.  &quot;Great.  Now I really need to change 
back.&quot;  she said and headed for the door.

	She froze.  How was she going to change back?  She couldn&#39;t 
go back to the bathroom.  Nabiki and Ranko were probably still in 
there, and she didn&#39;t want to see that again.  She could go the 
kitchen, but unfortunately her only clean set of clothes were still in the 
bathroom.  While she had no problem going topless, she was currently 
topless and bottomless, and that could be a big problem once she 
changed back.

	Ranma groaned as she felt something wet trickle down her 
thigh.  She couldn&#39;t exactly go on like this.  If she was a guy she&#39;d 
just jack off and be done with it.  Problem solved.  But she couldn&#39;t do 
that as a girl.

	Why not, Ranma thought.  She had masturbated once before.  
But that was after she had been Cat Tongued and before she found out 
about the Phoenix pill.  She thought she was going to be a girl for the 
rest of her life.

	&quot;Well, I can&#39;t exactly change back now, can I?&quot;  Ranma 
said as she sat down on the floor and spread her legs, her decision 
made.

	She started to gently caress her mound, softly moaning as she 
began to get even more aroused.  She brought one hand up to squeeze 
her breast, flicking the nipple with her forefinger until it got hard.  
Ranma always got upset when someone grabbed her breasts, mainly 
because it felt so good.  Now that she was producing those sensations 
herself, it felt even better.  It wasn&#39;t long before her clit emerged from 
beneath it&#39;s hood.  Not thinking clearly, she grabbed her clit and 
pinched it, hard.  She yelped as the almost painful sensation hit her.  
Not wanting to repeat that mistake, she settled on gently stroking it 
instead.  Much better, she thought as her actions brought her to the 
next level.  Slowly, she slipped a finger into her sex.  She jumped as 
she came in contact with a barrier a short distance inside.  She didn&#39;t 
know enough about her body to know what it was, but she knew she 
didn&#39;t want to mess with it.  Instead, she ran her finger back and forth 
just inside her pussy lips.  Her breath grew ragged as she felt herself 
on the edge of her orgasm, and then she was there.  She moaned 
loudly as her body started to spasm.  Every nerve in her body was 
electrified as she felt the wave of ecstasy wash over her.  The feeling 
slowly subsided, leaving a delicious warmth behind.  Ranma laid back 
on the floor, taking her breath in short gasps.

	*tap, tap, tap*

	Ranma turned to the window to see what was making the 
noise.

	&quot;You know, for someone who says he hates being a girl, you 
seem to be taking advantage of the situation.&quot;  Ranko said as she 
floated outside the window.

	&quot;Aaah!&quot;  Ranma screamed and ran to the door, finding 
Nabiki on the other side.

	&quot;Bravo!  Bravo!&quot;  Nabiki said while clapping.  &quot;What a 
performance!&quot;

	This was too much for Ranma.  She fainted.

	&quot;You think maybe we over did it?&quot;  Ranko asked as Nabiki let 
her in the room.

	&quot;If you ask me, the peeping tom got what he deserved.&quot;  
Nabiki replied.

	A little while later Ranma woke to find herself dressed in her 
muscle-tee and boxers.  &quot;It was all a bad dream.&quot;  She said, sounding 
relieved.

	&quot;So the pervert is awake.&quot;

	Ranma turned around to see Ranko and Nabiki sitting behind 
her.  As usual she spoke without thinking.  &quot;Hey!  What I do in my 
own room is none of your business!&quot;

	&quot;Actually, I was referring to you spying on us.&quot;  Nabiki 
replied.  &quot;But now that you mention it, have you played with yourself 
as a girl before?&quot;

	&quot;No, never.&quot;  Ranma answered.  Then she noticed that Ranko 
was staring at her.

	&quot;He&#39;s lying.&quot;  Ranko said with a grin.  &quot;I&#39;d say it&#39;s his second 
time.&quot;

	&quot;How did you know that?&quot;  Ranma asked, and winced as she 
realized that she just admitted that she was lying.

	&quot;How did I know that you were lying, or that it was you&#39;re 
second time?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;Both.&quot;

	&quot;Well, I&#39;ve had that body for a sixteen years longer than you 
have.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot; I know how it reacts when I&#39;m lying.&quot;

	&quot;You can do that?&quot;  Nabiki asked, an evil grin appearing on 
her face.

	&quot;Don&#39;t get your hopes up.&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;It doesn&#39;t work 
when he&#39;s a guy.&quot;

	&quot;Oh, well.&quot;  Nabiki said, her smile shrinking a bit.  &quot;It&#39;s 
something, at least.&quot;

	&quot;Anyway, back to what I was saying.&quot;  Ranko said, turning 
back to Ranma.  &quot;Since I knew you were lying, then it couldn&#39;t have 
been you&#39;re first time.  But from watching you I could tell that you 
weren&#39;t very experienced, so I guessed that it was you&#39;re second time.&quot;

	&quot;You won&#39;t tell anybody, will you?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;I guess we can&#39;t blame you for what you did.  After seeing us 
in action, I&#39;d be surprised if you didn&#39;t get horny.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;I&#39;ll 
keep my mouth shut if you don&#39;t tell Dad or Soun what I was doing.&quot;

	&quot;Of course that doesn&#39;t excuse him from peeking at us in the 
first place.&quot;  Nabiki broke in.

	&quot;I didn&#39;t know you were doing THAT!&quot;  Ranma yelled.

	&quot;Even if we weren&#39;t, that&#39;s still no excuse.&quot;  Nabiki replied.

	&quot;I give up.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;What do you want?&quot;

	&quot;You and Ranko are going on a trip for a few days.&quot;  Nabiki 
replied.  &quot;She needs to explain a few things to you.&quot;

	&quot;When?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;As soon as you take a bath.&quot;  Ranko answered.  &quot;We&#39;ll pack 
for you.&quot;

	&quot;How long are we gonna be gone?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Three nights.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	&quot;Well, I&#39;ll start getting his things together.&quot;  Nabiki said and 
left the room.  Ranko stayed behind.

	&quot;Ranma , can I ask you a question?&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;Yeah.&quot;

	&quot;Well, I know that Dad engaged you to Akane, so I was 
wondering, do you love her?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;I...&quot;

	&quot;Remember, I know if you&#39;re lying.&quot;

	&quot;I...don&#39;t know.&quot;  Ranma replied.

	Ranko&#39;s eyes widened in shock.  &quot;My god, you really don&#39;t 
know.&quot;

	&quot;You gonna be okay?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, just got caught off guard.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;Well, hurry 
up and take your bath.  I want to have lunch at Ucchan&#39;s before they 
get to busy.&quot;

	&quot;You got it!&quot;  Ranma said, the mention of food bring her out 
of the daze that she was in.

	A little while later Ranma exited the bathroom, having rid 
himself of his female body for the moment.  The bath was nowhere 
near as relaxing as he thought it would be, mainly because he was still 
thinking about his sister with Nabiki.  He knew there wasn&#39;t a chance 
of getting any explanations out of Nabiki, so he would have to ask 
Ranko when they left on their trip.

	&quot;Ready to go?&quot;  Ranko asked as she handed Ranma a small 
backpack.

	&quot;I guess.&quot;  Ranma replied.

	At the front door Nabiki stopped them.  &quot;Aren&#39;t you 
forgetting something?&quot;  she asked.

	&quot;I&#39;d never forget you, love.&quot;  Ranko replied and gave her a 
passionate kiss.

	&quot;...&quot;  Ranma couldn&#39;t respond.  The amount of love he saw 
in that kiss told him that this wasn&#39;t some fling.  His sister definitely 
had some explaining to do.

	Nabiki broke the kiss and noticed that Ranma was staring.  
&quot;You want one too?&quot;  she asked.

	&quot;Uh...no.&quot;  Ranma answered, not believing she even asked.

	&quot;Good.  Only Ranko gets freebies.&quot;  Nabiki said.  &quot;Bye, 
Ranko baby.&quot;

	&quot;Bye, Nabiki.  Tell Dad that we&#39;ll be back in a few days.&quot;  
Ranko said as she and Ranma left.

	A little ways down the road Ranma decided to get some answers.

	&quot;Ranko, do you mind telling me just what you were doing 
with Nabiki earlier?&quot;

	&quot;Making love.&quot;  Ranko replied bluntly.

	&quot;I know that.&quot;  Ranma said, trying not to sound like a 
complete idiot.  &quot;I guess what I really want to know is why.&quot;

	&quot;Because I love her and she loves me.&quot;  Ranko answered.

	&quot;But you&#39;re both girls.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;Yeah.  What&#39;s your point?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;Girls are supposed to fall in love with guys.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;Most girls do.  But some choose not to, like Nabiki.  And 
then there are girls like me who can&#39;t fall in love with a man.&quot;  Ranko 
replied.

	&quot;What do you mean you, can&#39;t?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;I don&#39;t know why.&quot;  Ranko answered.  &quot;I guess my brain just 
isn&#39;t set up to fall in love with a man.&quot;

	&quot;So you&#39;re a lesbian?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;No.&quot; Ranko answered.

	&quot;Now I&#39;m confused.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;You weren&#39;t confused before?&quot;  Ranko said with a grin.

	&quot;You just told me that you don&#39;t like guys and you only love 
girls, but you say you&#39;re not gay.&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;You&#39;re confusing love with sex.&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;I enjoy 
sex with men.  It&#39;s just that I wouldn&#39;t want to spend the rest of my 
life with one.&quot;

	&quot;I still don&#39;t understand.&quot;  Ranma said, the confusion clear 
on his face.

	&quot;I&#39;ll see if I can clear things up later.&quot;  Ranko said as they 
approached Ucchan&#39;s.

	&quot;Ran-chan!  Red-chan!&quot;  Ukyo called out as they entered the 
restaurant.

	&quot;Red-chan?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;You don&#39;t like it?&quot;  Ukyo asked.

	&quot;Oh, I like it.  It&#39;s just that I&#39;m surprised that you&#39;re so 
friendly with someone you&#39;ve only known a few days.&quot;

	&quot;And why shouldn&#39;t I?  We&#39;re going to be sister&#39;s one day.&quot;  
Ukyo said.

	&quot;Huh?&quot;  Ranko said and then remembered the background 
info that Nabiki gave her on Ranma.  &quot;Oh, yeah.  You&#39;re engaged to 
Ranma.&quot;

	&quot;I wouldn&#39;t get too friendly with Red, Miss Kuonji.&quot;  Yoiko 
said from behind the grill.  &quot;She might take it the wrong way.&quot;

	&quot;That reminds me.&quot;  Ukyo said.  &quot;How are things with you 
and Nabiki?&quot;

	&quot;How did you know about that?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;Yoiko told me.&quot;  Ukyo said.

	&quot;Okay, Yoiko.  Fess up.  How did you know me and Nabiki 
were an item?&quot;

	&quot;C&#39;mon, Red.  It was so obvious from the way you and Miss 
Tendo were looking at each other the other day.&quot;  Yoiko replied.

	&quot;Well, I guess everyone knows now.&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;Everyone?  Who else knows?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Let me see.  You, Akane...&quot;

	&quot;Akane knows!?!&quot;  Ranma yelled.

	&quot;Yep.  Okay, it&#39;s you, Akane, Kasumi, Skuld, Shampoo, 
maybe Mousse, maybe Cologne, Ukyo, Yoiko, Nabiki obviously.  You 
told Ryoga?&quot;

	&quot;Not about Miss Tendo.  But he does know that you like 
girls.&quot;  Yoiko answered.  &quot;He said something about perverts running in 
the family.&quot;

	&quot;This coming from someone who turns into a pig to get into 
Akane&#39;s bed.&quot;  Ukyo said.

	&quot;Wait a minute!&quot;  Ranma yelled.  &quot;How did you find out 
about that?&quot;

	&quot;Yoiko told me.&quot;  Ukyo replied.

	&quot;What do you mean, he turns into a pig?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;Apparently he followed Mr. Saotome to China and fell in the 
spring of drowned pig.&quot;  Yoiko replied, then noticed Ranko was 
giggling.  &quot;What?&quot;

	&quot;You finally find your long lost brother, then find out that 
he&#39;s not even your species.&quot;

	&quot;At least I don&#39;t have a panda for a father and a brother who&#39;s 
my sister.&quot;  Yoiko replied with a grin.

	&quot;At least my brother doesn&#39;t sneak into girls bedrooms in his 
cursed form.&quot;  Ranko said with a bigger grin.

	&quot;He says it&#39;s not like that.&quot;  Yoiko said.  &quot;He just wants to 
protect her from Ranma.&quot;  Yoiko said and then whispered to Ranko.  
&quot;I didn&#39;t bother to tell him that you were a bigger threat.&quot;

	&quot;So I take it that Akane doesn&#39;t know about him being 
cursed?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;No, and you&#39;re not going to tell her, either.&quot;  Yoiko replied.

	&quot;Okay, provided you don&#39;t tell Dad or Soun about me and 
Nabiki.&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;Deal.&quot;  Yoiko said.  &quot;So what do you want to eat?&quot;

	Ranma and Ranko placed their orders and started chatting 
with Ukyo when Akane walked in.

	&quot;Hello, Miss Tendo.&quot;  Yoiko said.

	&quot;Hi.&quot;  Akane said, then noticed the backpacks on the floor 
beside Ranma and Ranko.  &quot;You two going somewhere?&quot;  she asked.

	&quot;Ranma and I are leaving town for a few days to get to know 
each other.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	&quot;You planning on telling him about...you know?&quot;

	&quot;Too late.&quot;  Ranko said with a grin.  &quot;Guess who walked in 
on me and Nabiki this morning?&quot;

	&quot;Ranma!&quot;  Akane yelled.

	&quot;Hey!  It&#39;s not like I wanted to see that!&quot;  Ranma yelled back.  
&quot;Besides, you probably did the same thing or you wouldn&#39;t know about 
it.&quot;

	&quot;I only saw them kissing, not like you, you pervert.&quot;  Akane 
said.

	&quot;Would you two please knock off the lovers quarrel?&quot;  Ranko 
demanded.

	&quot;We are NOT lovers.&quot;  Akane said.

	&quot;Well stop it anyway.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;You&#39;re ruining my 
meal.&quot;

	&quot;She&#39;s bluffing.&quot;  Yoiko broke in.  &quot;Nothing can ruin her 
appetite.  Not with her cast-iron stomach.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m not that bad.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	&quot;What about that time you ate a live mouse?&quot;  Yoiko asked.

	&quot;Eww.  That&#39;s gross.&quot;  Ukyo said.

	&quot;Hey!  It&#39;s not like that!&quot;  Ranko yelled.  &quot;Brittany dared me.&quot;

	&quot;Miss Diggers is a were-cat.&quot;  Yoiko said.  &quot;To her mice are 
part of a well balanced breakfast.&quot;

	&quot;W-w-were-cat???&quot;  Ranma said, turning white as a sheet.

	&quot;What&#39;s with him?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;Nothing.&quot;  Akane said.  &quot;He&#39;s just scared of cats.&quot;

	&quot;You&#39;re kidding?&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;Nope.&quot;  Akane replied.  &quot;Some weird training of you&#39;re dad&#39;s 
did it to him.&quot;

	&quot;Well, you can relax, Ranma.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;Brit lives in 
America, so she won&#39;t be showing up anytime soon.&quot;

	&quot;Okay.&quot;  Ranma said, breathing a sigh of relief.  &quot;Well, at least 
that explains how you survived Akane&#39;s cooking.&quot;

	&quot;What about my cooking!?!&quot;  Akane yelled, preparing to deck 
Ranma.

	&quot;That reminds me.&quot;  Ranma said as he dodged the blow.  
&quot;How come you ain&#39;t pounded Ranko yet?&quot;

	&quot;Why would I?&quot;  Akane asked.

	&quot;Well don&#39;t you consider her and Nabiki perverts, after what 
they&#39;ve done?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;No, because I consider Ranko a friend and she and Nabiki 
seem to like each other.&quot;  Akane answered.  &quot;Besides, if it&#39;ll keep 
Nabiki out of our hair then...&quot;  She froze as she felt the tip of Ranko&#39;s 
dagger pressing against her back.

	&quot;You weren&#39;t about to bad mouth my girlfriend, were you?&quot;  
Ranko asked in a tone that gave Akane the chills.

	&quot;Uh...no.  Of course not.&quot;  Akane answered nervously.

	&quot;Good.&quot;  Ranko said cheerfully.  &quot;Well, Ranma.  Let&#39;s get 
going.&quot;

	&quot;Don&#39;t worry about her, Miss Tendo.&quot;  Yoiko said after the 
twins left.  &quot;She hasn&#39;t killed anyone in months.&quot;

	&quot;Where are we going, anyway?&quot;  Ranma asked Ranko as they 
got on a bus.

	&quot;To a hotel by the beach.&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;Um...I know this is a stupid question, but have you been to 
the beach since you&#39;ve been cursed?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Don&#39;t worry.  I packed us the appropriate swim wear.&quot;  Ranko 
answered.  &quot;It&#39;s you&#39;re fault I&#39;m cursed, anyway.&quot;

	&quot;How&#39;s it my fault!?!&quot;  Ranma shouted.

	&quot;When I went to Nyu-che-zu, I was expecting to get laid, not 
to be attacked by a hundred angry Amazons.&quot;  Ranko stated.  &quot;They 
told me that I defeated one of their warriors and was marked for death.  
I told them I didn&#39;t know what they were talking about.  Then all hell 
broke loose.&quot;

	&quot;What happened?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;A roc attacked the village.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	&quot;Did someone use a catapult or something?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Not a rock, stupid.  A roc. You know, the giant bird.&quot;  
Ranko said.

	&quot;Oh.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;Anyway, this thing flies in and grabs one of the Amazons.&quot;  
Ranko continued.  &quot;I don&#39;t know what was worse, her screaming when 
it grabbed her or the sound she made when it tore her head off.&quot;

	&quot;Eww...&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;You&#39;re not the one who caught the head.&quot;  Ranko said.  
&quot;Well, I&#39;m not one to miss an opportunity, so I tell them that me and 
Yoiko will kill the bird if they let me go.  They agree and I end up 
getting used as bait for the monster.  It grabs me and Yoiko starts 
flinging boulders at it to get it to drop me.  And drop me it did, right 
into the Nannichaun.&quot;

	&quot;So it was Yoiko&#39;s fault you fell, not me.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;Yoiko was trying to save my life.&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;But I 
would have never been in danger if it wasn&#39;t for you.&quot;

	&quot;What did I do?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Why were the Amazons pissed at me?&quot;  Ranko asked

	&quot;Because they thought you defeated one of their warriors.&quot;  
Ranma said.

	&quot;And why was Shampoo trying to kill me the other day.&quot;

	&quot;Because she thought you were me.&quot;  Ranma said.

	Ranko waited a few minutes for Ranma to make the 
connection.

	&quot;You mean they thought you were me?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;And if you weren&#39;t so stupid as to fight an Amazon and let 
her live, then I would have never had to go after that Roc in the first 
place.&quot;

	&quot;What did you expect me to do, kill her?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Yes.&quot;  Ranko replied bluntly.  &quot;To her there is no greater 
honor than to die in combat.&quot;

	&quot;That&#39;s still no excuse to kill her.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;Ranma, don&#39;t you know anything about Amazon mating 
rituals?&quot;  Ranko asked with an irritated tone.

	&quot;What&#39;s that got to do with anything!&quot;  Ranma yelled.

	&quot;Showing mercy after a battle is a sign of great love.&quot;  Ranko 
replied.  &quot;According to Amazon law, you proposed to her.&quot;

	&quot;But we were both girls at the time.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;Same sex marriages aren&#39;t uncommon in a female dominated 
society.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;And since you bested her in combat, marrying 
you would mean abandoning her tribe to be with an outsider.&quot;

	&quot;So that&#39;s why she gave me the Kiss of Death?  Because she 
thought I was trying to take her away?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Yep.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	&quot;Wait a minute.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;Isn&#39;t she abandoning her 
tribe to be with an outsider by trying to marry me now?&quot;

	&quot;No, because you&#39;re a guy.   Inferior by definition.&quot;  Ranko 
answered with a grin.

	&quot;Hey!&quot;

	&quot;Don&#39;t blame me.  In Nyu-che-zu it&#39;s a fact of life.&quot;  Ranko 
replied.  &quot;Anyway, by defeating her you proved you were worthy and 
by letting her live you proposed. But if you got married then she&#39;d be 
the one in charge.&quot;

	&quot;You make it sound like she&#39;d be the husband and I&#39;d be the 
wife.&quot;  Ranma said.

	That&#39;s it exactly.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	Ranma tried to picture himself staying home and taking care 
of the kids while Shampoo was off at work.  He shuttered at the 
thought.

	Ranko noticed her brother&#39;s reaction.  &quot;C&#39;mon.  It wouldn&#39;t be 
that bad.&quot;  she said while trying not to laugh.  &quot;Well, I didn&#39;t take you 
on this trip so you could learn about Shampoo&#39;s love life.  I want us to 
get to know each other.&quot;

	&quot;Sure.&quot;  Ranma replied and they started to exchange stories of 
their travels.  Ranma&#39;s with Genma, and Ranko&#39;s with Yoiko.  Ranma 
was in the middle of telling about his gymnastics match against 
Kodachi when the bus arrived at their destination.

	&quot;You know, that&#39;s the only one of your admirers that I 
haven&#39;t met.&quot;  Ranko said as they got off the bus.

	&quot;Trust me, you don&#39;t want to.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;Why not?&quot;  Ranko asked.  &quot;She couldn&#39;t be that bad.&quot;

	&quot;She is.&quot;  Ranma replied.  &quot;She&#39;s violent, obsessive, 
underhanded, homicidal...&quot;

	&quot;The same thing has been said about me.&quot;  Ranko broke in.

	&quot;Yeah, well...&quot;  Ranma didn&#39;t want to think about the 
similarities between Kodachi and his sister.  &quot;The main reason you 
want to avoid her is that she doesn&#39;t know about the curse.&quot;

	&quot;You mean she thinks there really is a pigtailed girl?&quot;  Ranko 
asked.

	&quot;Uh, huh.&quot;  Ranma replied.  &quot;And to make it worse, she 
thinks that my girl side is in love with me, so she&#39;ll probably be pissed 
at you.&quot;

	&quot;Oh, that&#39;s easy to fix.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;I&#39;ll just tell her the 
truth.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;ve tried telling her that I turn into a girl, but she just won&#39;t 
listen.&quot;

	&quot;Not that, moron.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;I mean, tell her that I&#39;m 
you&#39;re sister.  Then she can&#39;t consider me competition.&quot;

	Ranma thought about it for a minute, then his eyes lit up.  
&quot;Hey, we could tell Kuno the same thing to get him off my back.&quot;

	&quot;Exactly.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	&quot;Ranko, you&#39;re a genius.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;All in a days work for a love goddess like me.&quot;

	Ranko&#39;s statement reminded Ranma of one of the things he 
wanted to ask her.  &quot;How did all this goddess stuff start, anyway?&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;ll tell you over dinner.&quot;  Ranko said as they reached the 
hotel.  &quot;I hear that the hotel restaurant is great.&quot;

	After checking in and having the bellboy take their bags to 
their room, Ranko and Ranma got a table in the restaurant.

	Ranma looked at the menu and his eyes bulged as he saw the 
prices.  &quot;Ranko, do you know how much this stuff costs?&quot;

	&quot;Relax, I can afford it.  Order anything you want.&quot;  Ranko 
said then directed her attention to the waitress.  &quot;Escargot, please.&quot;

	Ranma wondered what Ranko ordered, then decided that it 
didn&#39;t matter since it wasn&#39;t his order.  &quot;Steak.&quot;  he told the waitress.

	&quot;Where are you getting the money for all this?&quot;  Ranma 
asked.

	&quot;Monster hunting is pretty profitable.&quot;  Ranko answered.  
&quot;And me and Yoiko made a lot of money when we were in Hong 
Kong.&quot;

	&quot;What did you do there?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;I was a prostitute.&quot;  Ranko answered offhandedly.

	&quot;You were a WHAT!?!&quot;  Ranma yelled.

	&quot;Calm down.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;I worked for an exclusive sex 
club.  Members only.  It&#39;s not like I was a street walker or anything.&quot;

	&quot;That&#39;s not the point!&quot;  Ranma yelled.  &quot;Damn it, Ranko.  
What were you thinking?&quot;

	&quot;It was too good an opportunity to pass up.&quot;  Ranko replied 
calmly.  &quot;Not many of these places cater to both men and women, so 
when they offered me a job, I said I would take it.  Provided they hired 
Yoiko too, that is.&quot;

	&quot;My God.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;Ryoga&#39;s gonna kill you when he 
finds out you made his sister a prostitute.&quot;

	&quot;I didn&#39;t.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;She got a job as a bouncer so she 
could keep me safe.  Now, could we change the subject.  People are 
starting to stare.&quot;

	Ranma looked up to see that there were a lot of people 
looking at them.  &quot;Sorry.&quot;  he said.

	A few minutes later the waitress returned with their orders.  
Ranma&#39;s mouth watered when he saw his steak.  Then he saw Ranko&#39;s 
order.

	Ranko noticed her brother looking at her plate with a funny 
look on his face.  &quot;Want some?&quot;  she asked.

	&quot;Ranko, are those snails?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;Yes.&quot;  she answered.

	&quot;And you&#39;re actually going to eat those?&quot;  he asked.

	&quot;Urd fed me a lot weirder stuff when I lived with her.&quot;  Ranko 
answered and started eating.

	&quot;Why do you want to be a goddess, anyway?&quot;  Ranma asked, 
directing his attention to his own meal instead of hers.

	&quot;Mainly because I want to get cured.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	&quot;Changing into a guy doesn&#39;t seem to bother you that much.&quot;  
Ranma said.

	&quot;It didn&#39;t bother me at all when I first got cursed.  I figured 
that it was a way to get more women who wouldn&#39;t sleep with me 
otherwise.&quot;  Ranko&#39;s face became grim.  &quot;Of course all that changed a 
month later.&quot;

	&quot;What happened?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Nothing happened.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	&quot;Huh?&quot;

	&quot;I missed my period.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;Haven&#39;t had one since.&quot;

	&quot;That&#39;s a bad thing?&quot;  From what Ranma remembered from 
his health class, he figured that menstruation was a pain in the ass.  
Thankfully that was one part of female biology that he didn&#39;t possess.

	&quot;Yes it&#39;s bad, you insensitive bastard.&quot;  Ranko said, her voice 
quivering.  &quot;If I don&#39;t have a period, I can&#39;t have kids.&quot;

	&quot;Oh.&quot;  Ranma could tell that having children was very 
important to Ranko.

	&quot;Anyway,&quot;  Ranko perked up a bit.  &quot;While looking for a 
cure, I ended up at Keiichi&#39;s place.&quot;

	&quot;Who&#39;s Keiichi?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Oh, sorry.&quot;  Ranko forgot that Ranma didn&#39;t know very 
much about her past.  &quot;Keiichi is Belldandy&#39;s boyfriend.  Urd and 
Skuld live with them.  Anyway, I get blasted with some weird spell 
that changes my body so I can use magic.  Next thing I know I&#39;m on 
the phone with the Almighty and he&#39;s offering me a job.&quot;

	&quot;Wait a minute, you had a conversation with the Supreme 
Being?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;That&#39;s what they tell me.&quot;  Ranko answered.  &quot;So, one thing 
leads to another, and I end up being Urd&#39;s pupil.&quot;

	&quot;What about the cure?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;I figure that once I&#39;m a full fledged goddess, then finding a 
cure should be easy.&quot;

	&quot;You&#39;ll cure the rest of us too, right?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;I can understand why Dad and Ryoga want to get cured, but 
what&#39;s so bad about being a girl?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;Hey, I&#39;m a guy!&quot;  Ranma shouted.  &quot;Besides, Shampoo and 
Mousse are cursed, too.&quot;

	&quot;Really?  What do they change into?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;Well, Mousse turns into a duck and Shampoo turns into a...&quot;  
He mumbled the last word.

	&quot;What was that?&quot;  Ranko said, holding her hand by her ear.  
&quot;I didn&#39;t hear you.&quot;

	&quot;a...cat...&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Well, I can see how that might affect her love life.&quot;  Ranko 
said.

	After dinner Ranma and Ranko went up to their room.

	&quot;Wait here.&quot;  Ranko said, leaving her brother outside the 
door.  A minute later she returned holding an ice bucket.  &quot;Can you get 
some ice, please?&quot;

	&quot;Okay.&quot;  Ranma said, grabbing the bucket.  He looked in the 
room and only saw one bed.  Guess I&#39;m sleeping on the floor, he 
thought.

	A few minutes later Ranma knocked at the door.  When he 
opened the door he smelled something strange in the air.  He saw an 
incense burner in the corner.  &quot;What&#39;s the incense for?&quot;  he asked.

	&quot;It helps me relax.&quot;  Ranko answered.

	&quot;Easy for you to relax.&quot;  Ranma said, sitting down on the bed 
next to Ranko.  &quot;You&#39;ve got a bed to sleep in.&quot;

	&quot;So do you.&quot;  Ranko said and kissed Ranma, pushing him 
back on the bed.

	Ranma started to respond to the kiss, then pushed Ranko off 
of him.  &quot;Are you nuts!&quot;  he shouted.

	&quot;What&#39;s the problem?&quot;  Ranko asked.  &quot;I told you I like 
having sex with men.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m your brother!&quot;  Ranma yelled.  &quot;I can&#39;t do that!&quot;

	&quot;Then I&#39;ll die.&quot;

	&quot;What?&quot;  Ranma asked, momentarily forgetting his anger.

	&quot;I need to have sex on a regular basis or I&#39;ll die.&quot;  Ranko 
replied.  &quot;So, will you give me what I need?&quot;

	&quot;No.&quot;  Ranma answered.  &quot;Not until you give me the details.&quot;

	&quot;Fine.&quot; Ranko said and returned to sitting beside Ranma.  
&quot;Remember when I said that my body was changed so I could use 
magic?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah.&quot;

	&quot;Well, my body is like a battery for sexual energy.  Whenever 
I use magic it drains off that power.&quot;  Ranko explained.  
&quot;Unfortunately, if I use that up, my life will start to fade away until I&#39;m 
dead.&quot;

	&quot;Well, if using magic is killing you, then stop using it.&quot;  
Ranma said.

	&quot;Could you quit martial arts, even if it meant your life?&quot;  
Ranko asked.

	Ranma paused.  He couldn&#39;t imagine life without martial arts.

	&quot;There.  You see.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;We&#39;re both willing to lay 
down our lives for the Art.  Just different arts.&quot;

	&quot;Well, why do you need me?  I mean, you&#39;re in love with 
Nabiki.&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;It&#39;s because I&#39;m in love with Nabiki that I can&#39;t rely on her as 
my only power source.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	&quot;Huh?&quot;

	&quot;Before I moved in with you, I had four willing partners.  If I 
were to try to get that much energy from Nabiki, then our love making 
would lose it&#39;s meaning and become just fucking.&quot;  Ranko explained.

	&quot;Four people?&quot;

	&quot;That&#39;s right.  Skuld preferred my male form while Belldandy 
and Keiichi liked to have three ways with my female form.  Urd didn&#39;t 
really care what form I was in.&quot;

	&quot;Uh...that&#39;s more information than I really wanted to know.&quot;  
Ranma said, blushing slightly.

	&quot;Anyway, even with you and Nabiki, I&#39;m going to have to 
limit myself on how much magic I use.&quot;

	&quot;Couldn&#39;t you...um...masturbate?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Masturbating helps stop power leaks when I&#39;m low on 
energy, but it doesn&#39;t produce any energy of it&#39;s own.&quot;  Ranko said.  
&quot;So, you&#39;ve got the details.  What&#39;s your decision?&quot;

	&quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this, but okay.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;Really?&quot;  Ranko replied, her eyes sparkling with undisguised 
joy.

	&quot;You don&#39;t have to sound so happy.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;What 
were doing is pretty perverted.&quot;

	&quot;No it&#39;s not.&quot;  Ranko said and pushed Ranma back on the bed 
again, kissing him deeply.

	Ranma decided to try and forget that this was his sister and 
enjoy himself.  So when he felt Ranko&#39;s tongue enter his mouth, he 
met it with his own.  They played with each others mouths for several 
minutes before Ranko broke the kiss.

	Ranko smiled.  She was getting better results than she 
expected.  She started unbuttoning his shirt, kissing down his chest as 
each inch was exposed.

	Ranma had begun to get aroused by his tongue wrestling 
match with Ranko, but when she started to undress him, he went from 
merely aroused to rock hard.  He gasped when Ranko pulled down his 
pants and boxers.

	Ranko suppressed a giggle.  &quot;I always thought it was the girl 
who was supposed to gasp when the guy&#39;s cock made it&#39;s appearance.&quot;

	Ranma groaned.  &quot;Incest AND bad jokes?&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s not that I&#39;m not impressed with it.&quot;  Ranko said and 
started stroking his shaft.  &quot;After all, I know first hand what it&#39;s 
capable of.&quot;

	Ranma moaned as Ranko worked over his manhood with her 
fingers.  A girls hand felt a lot better than his own.

	&quot;Do you like this?&quot;  Ranko asked, slowing her actions just 
enough to keep him from coming.

	&quot;It&#39;s great.&quot;  Ranma replied.







	&quot;Well, I bet you&#39;ll like this even better.&quot;  Ranko said, and with 
one quick motion engulfed his cock untill her nose was nestled in his 
pubic hair.  She slowly pulled back, drawing her lips across the shaft 
until only the head was in her mouth.  Then she plunged forward 
again.

	Ranma couldn&#39;t believe what he was feeling.  Ranko&#39;s hand 
job was great, but it was nothing compared to the pleasure she was 
giving him with her mouth.  He started reflexively thrusting his hips 
up, humping her face.  Soon it became too much for him.  &quot;Ranko, 
stop!  I&#39;m gonna...&quot;But the warning came too late.  He shot his load in 
her mouth, but to his surprise this only encouraged her.  Instead of 
pulling back or spitting it out, she locked her lips around the base of 
his penis and started swallowing the cum that was filling her mouth.  
She released his member once it stopped twitching and became soft.

	&quot;Did I do good?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;That was wonderful.  Thank you.&quot;  Ranma replied.

	&quot;Don&#39;t thank me yet.  I&#39;m not done.&quot;  Ranko said  &quot;I mean, 
what&#39;s wrong with this picture?&quot;

	&quot;What?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Look at the floor.&quot;  Ranko said.

	Ranma looked down to see his clothes in a pile on the floor.  
&quot;So?&quot;

	&quot;Don&#39;t you think that my clothes should be there too?&quot;

	Ranma looked up to see that Ranko was still fully dressed.  
He started unbuttoning her shirt, and was surprised to find her wearing 
a bra underneath.  She pulled off her pants to reveal matching black 
silk panties.  &quot;I thought you wore boxers.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;I normally do, but Nabiki said these were sexier.&quot;  Ranko 
replied and grabbed his hands, placing them on her breasts.&quot;

	Ranma kneaded her breasts for a few moments.  Even through 
the bra he could feel her nipples get hard.  He was about to reach 
around her back to undo her bra when he noticed that the clasp was in 
the front.  &quot;Aren&#39;t these things supposed to attach in the back?&quot;  he 
asked.

	&quot;I&#39;m impatient.&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;Men are too clumsy to get 
a normal bra off.&quot;

	Ranma was about to protest her derogatory remark, but 
decided against it.  He unsnapped her bra and let the two halves fall 
away from her body.  He returned to fondling her breasts, this time 
without interference.  Apparently his hands weren&#39;t enough, though, 
because Ranko grabbed the back of his head and forced it down to her 
breasts.  Taking her not so subtle hint, Ranma captured one of her 
nipples in his mouth and began sucking on it.  He was rewarded with a 
soft moan from Ranko.

	Ranko sighed.  For a first-timer, Ranma was doing very well.  
Although he was paying a bit too much attention to her breasts while 
other parts of her body needed work.  She gently tugged on his pigtail 
until his head was level with hers and gave him a passionate kiss.  
She grabbed his hand and guided it into her panties.

	Ranma knew what she wanted.  After all, he had done the 
same thing to himself earlier that day.  He ran his fingers over her 
mound until he felt her clit emerge.  Taking care not to be too rough, 
he started rubbing her clit in little circles.  Ranko started moaning 
louder and gyrating her hips.  The motion caused Ranma&#39;s hand to slip 
and a finger plunged into her pussy.  Hearing the startled gasp from 
Ranko, he started to withdraw his hand.  But she placed her hand over 
his before he could remove it completely.

	&quot;Don&#39;t stop.&quot;  Ranko told him.  &quot;That feels good.&quot;  She started 
pumping his finger in and out of her, establishing a rhythm that he 
soon picked up.

	Ranma kept thrusting his fingers into Ranko until he saw her 
body tense and then start to spasm as she came.  She threw her arms 
around him and writhed against his body for a few moments as the 
orgasm ran it&#39;s course.

	&quot;You did good, Ranma.&quot;  Ranko said as she caught her 
breath.  She removed his hand from her panties and held it in front of 
his face.  &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to taste the fruit of you&#39;re labors?&quot;

	Ranma eyed the glistening digits for a few moments, then 
touched his tongue to his fingertips.  The smile on his face told Ranko 
that he definitely considered it a good taste.  He was about to lower his 
head to the source of the juices when Ranko grabbed his chin and kept 
his head from moving.

	&quot;We&#39;ll get to that some other time.&quot;  Ranko said as she pulled 
off her panties.  Then she grabbed his manhood, which has regained 
it&#39;s hardness.  &quot;Right now I want this inside me.&quot;  She brought her 
hands up and traced the muscles on his chest.

	Ranma was about to grab her breasts when she shoved him 
back with strength he didn&#39;t know she possessed.  He fell back and 
landed on the bed.  &quot;Ranko!&quot;  he yelled.

	&quot;Sorry.  I got carried away.&quot;  She climbed on top of him and 
positioned herself over his erection.  For a second she was tempted to 
guide his cock into her ass, but she decided to stick to the basics.  She 
grasped his hard-on by the base and slowly slid it into her sex.

	&quot;Oh God...&quot;  Ranma moaned as he felt himself enter Ranko.  
He had a moment to enjoy just being inside of her before she started 
rocking back and forth on top of him.  He could feel his cock rubbing 
against the inner walls of her sex.  He started thrusting his hips up in 
time with Ranko&#39;s movements.

	Ranko&#39;s breath sped up as she enjoyed the feeling of a man 
penetrating her.  The constant pistoning of his erection inside of her 
had her close to orgasm, but it wasn&#39;t enough to send her over the 
edge.  She grabbed Ranma hands which had been resting on her hips 
and guided them to her breasts.

	Ranma fondled her breasts for a few minutes as he continued to 
thrust up into her.  Soon he got to the point where he couldn&#39;t hold 
back any longer.  He squeezed her tits hard when he came, but she 
didn&#39;t seem to mind because a second later she came as well.  After her 
body stopped shaking, she slid off of him and laid beside him on the 
bed.

	&quot;I take it that you enjoyed that.&quot;  Ranko said, noting the 
dazed expression on Ranma&#39;s face.

	&quot;That was amazing.&quot;  Ranma replied.

	&quot;It was nice.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;Now, tomorrow night, that will 
be amazing.&quot;

	&quot;Tomorrow?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;I want it to be a surprise.&quot;  Ranko answered she flipped the 
light switch by the bed.  She rested her head against his chest and he 
wrapped his arms around her.  Soon they were fast asleep.

	Ranko was the first to wake the next morning.  She was about 
to wake Ranma when she remembered that Nabiki had given her 
instructions on how to wake him up.  She got up and searched through 
the pile of clothes on the floor for Ranma&#39;s boxers.  After putting them 
on, she searched through the backpacks for one of the muscle tee&#39;s that 
she and Ranma normally wear to bed.  Once she put that on, she 
reached behind her head and untied her pigtail, letting her red hair 
cascade over her shoulders and down her back.  She stepped into the 
bathroom to check her appearance.  Satisfied that she looked like 
Nabiki said she should, Ranko returned to standing by her brother.  
She bent over Ranma and in her most seductive voice whispered the 
phrase that Nabiki had given her.  &quot;Awake, my love.  Awake.&quot;

	Ranma&#39;s eyes snapped open.  &quot;Yeeaaaa!!!&quot;  he screamed and 
jumped straight up, clinging to the ceiling.

	&quot;That&#39;s not the response I was expecting.&quot;  Ranko said, 
floating up next to him.

	&quot;S-stay away!&quot;  Ranma shouted and dropped from the ceiling, 
taking up a fighting stance.

	&quot;Is that any way to treat your sister?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;Sister?&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;Ranko?&quot;

	&quot;How many other amazingly built redhead sisters do you 
got?&quot;

	&quot;Sorry, Sis.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;I guess I over reacted.&quot;

	&quot;Well, you can explain later.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;Right now, you 
need a shower.&quot;

	As Ranma entered the bathroom, Ranko took a few minutes 
to lay out the clothes that they were going to wear.  Then, once she 
heard the shower running, she striped and entered the bathroom.

	Inside the bathroom Ranko saw the outline of Ranma&#39;s body 
through the shower curtain.  Without a second thought she pulled the 
curtain back and climbed in.

	&quot;Ranko!&quot;  Ranma shouted.

	&quot;Relax, I just figured it would be quicker if we took a shower 
together.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;I promise not to do anything sexual unless 
you ask.&quot;

	&quot;Well I ain&#39;t gonna ask.  I&#39;m only having sex with you 
because you&#39;ll die without it.&quot;  Ranma replied.

	&quot;Spoil sport.&quot;  Ranko said as she grabbed a bar of soap and 
started working up a lather on her body.

	It took a lot of will power for Ranma to keep from getting 
hard as he watched Ranko wash herself in front of him, but he 
managed.  Luckily, since she looked like his girl form, he was used to 
seeing her naked.

	&quot;Here.&quot;  Ranko said, handing Ranma the soap and turning 
around.  &quot;Wash my back.&quot;

	As Ranma washed her back, he noticed that her skin felt 
strange.  After he rinsed her off he leaned forward to take a closer 
look.  When he got within a few inches he saw several scars running 
across her back.  &quot;How did you get all of those?&quot;  he asked.

	&quot;The last boarding school I was in was big on corporal 
punishment.&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;They&#39;re whip marks?&quot;

	&quot;Most of them.&quot;

	&quot;No wonder you ran away.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;Oh, I liked that part.&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;It was the solitary 
confinement that made me leave.  I&#39;m terrified of being alone.&quot;

	&quot;You&#39;re weird.&quot;

	&quot;Normal is boring.&quot;  Ranko replied.  After they both rinsed 
off completely, Ranko turned off the water and stepped out of the 
shower.  &quot;Stay there.  &quot;I&#39;ll put some towels on the floor so we don&#39;t 
slip.&quot;  she told Ranma.  Once the towels were down she reached in the 
shower and twisted the cold water faucet.

	&quot;Cold!&quot;  Ranma-chan yelled as the cold water hit her.  She 
turned off the cold water, but Ranko grabbed her arm before she could 
turn the hot water on to change back.

	&quot;Don&#39;t.&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;Why not?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Well, two cute girls might be able to scam a free lunch off of 
somebody.&quot;

	&quot;Good point.&quot;  Ranma replied.

	&quot;Boy, that didn&#39;t take a lot of convincing.&quot;  Ranko said.  
&quot;Nabiki was right, you will degrade yourself for free eats.&quot;

	&quot;Hey!&quot;  Ranma yelled.

	&quot;I didn&#39;t mean that in a bad way.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	After drying off, Ranko started to get dressed in the blue skirt 
and blouse that she set out for herself.  Ranma, however, was not 
getting dressed.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;  she asked.

	&quot;I&#39;m not wearing that!&quot;  Ranma shouted and pointed to the 
clothes Ranko wanted her to wear.  On the bed was a yellow blouse 
with matching skirt and a white bra and panties.

	&quot;What&#39;s the problem?&quot;  Ranko asked.  &quot;I got that outfit out of 
your closet.&quot;

	&quot;Ranma looked closer and remembered that that&#39;s the outfit 
that she wore to play tennis with Akane when they were trying to catch 
Happosai.  &quot;Well, the bra and panties ain&#39;t mine!&quot;  she yelled.

	&quot;Fine, you don&#39;t have to wear the bra.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;But you 
are wearing the panties.&quot;

	&quot;No way!&quot;  Ranma reached for her boxers, but Ranko grabbed 
them first.  &quot;Hey!  Give me those!&quot;

	&quot;Get them yourself.&quot;  Ranko said and held out the boxers.  
Just as Ranma was about to grab them, she used her hammerspace 
implant to make them disappear.

	&quot;Where did they go?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;I ain&#39;t telling.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;So now you got two choices.  
Wear the panties or wear nothing.&quot;

	&quot;You tell anybody about this and you&#39;re dead.&quot;  Ranma 
threatened and put on the panties.  She may have her pride. but she 
didn&#39;t want to flash anyone if the wind blew her skirt up.

	&quot;Quit complaining.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;If it rains, you&#39;ll still be a 
girl wearing girl&#39;s clothes.  I, on the other hand, will look pretty stupid 
as a guy in girl&#39;s clothes.&quot;

	&quot;I guess I see you&#39;re point.&quot;  Ranma said as she put on the 
skirt and blouse.  She didn&#39;t have to change her wardrobe much after 
she got cursed because girls didn&#39;t look bad in boy&#39;s clothes.  She 
hadn&#39;t considered that Ranko probably wore dresses more often before 
she got cursed.

	&quot;You look great.&quot;  Ranko said as she lead Ranma out the 
door.

	&quot;You gonna leave you&#39;re hair like that?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Yeah.  This way we don&#39;t look too much alike.&quot;  Ranko 
replied.  &quot;People won&#39;t stare that way.&quot;

	&quot;Where are we going, anyway?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;To the tennis courts out back.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	Ranma grinned.  &quot;I&#39;m gonna beat you so bad.&quot;

	&quot;Aren&#39;t we confident.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;Besides, even if lose, 
what&#39;s the worst score I could get?&quot;

	&quot;Love.&quot;  Ranma replied.

	&quot;Exactly.&quot;  Ranko said with a big smile.

	&quot;Do you know you&#39;ve got a one track mind?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Yep.&quot;

	After a quick breakfast in the restaurant, Ranma and Ranko 
went to the tennis courts, only to find them all being used.

	&quot;Maybe we should come back later.&quot;  Ranma suggested.

	&quot;I can get us a court.&quot;  Ranko said.  She lead Ranma over to a 
court where two men were playing.  &quot;Excuse me, sir?&quot;  she called to 
one of them.

	&quot;Yes?&quot;  the man answered.

	&quot;My sister and I were going to play tennis today, but all the 
courts seem to be occupied.  I was wondering if we could use this one.&quot;  
Ranko explained.

	&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know...&quot;  the man said.

	&quot;Would you do it for a kiss?&quot;  Ranko asked.  She ignored the 
shocked expression on Ranma&#39;s face.

	&quot;From such a pretty girl?  How can I say no?&quot;  the man said.  
Ranma placed her hands on the sides of his face and gave him a long, 
slow kiss.

	&quot;Hey!  What about me?&quot;  the other man asked.

	&quot;Don&#39;t worry.  We haven&#39;t forgotten you.&quot;  Ranko said.  
&quot;Ranma, give him a kiss.&quot;

	&quot;I will NOT give him a kiss!&quot;  Ranma yelled.

	Ranko sighed and shook her head.  &quot;I apologize for my sister&#39;s 
rude behavior.  Her father picked her fiancee without asking, and she&#39;s 
a bit antisocial.&quot;

	&quot;You&#39;re not engaged, too, are you?&quot;  the man asked.

	&quot;I was, but he was sleeping with my best friend, so I&#39;m off the 
hook.&quot;  Ranko answered.  She grabbed the guy and gave him a kiss a 
kiss a lot more passionate than his friend.

	&quot;I...I...I...&quot;  The guy was shocked beyond words.  His friend 
lead him off the court.

	&quot;Do you have to get in a lip lock with everyone you meet?&quot;  
Ranma asked.

	&quot;Hey, I like kissing.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;Besides, I don&#39;t kiss 
everyone.&quot;

	&quot;What about Shampoo, Mousse, and Ryoga?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Shampoo kissed me first, I kissed Mousse because I thought 
he was a jealous boyfriend, and I kissed Ryoga to see if he&#39;d get a nose 
bleed, which he did.&quot;  Ranko answered.

	&quot;And what&#39;s with that story about you being engaged?&quot;  
Ranma asked.

	&quot;It&#39;s true.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;The guy who taught me how to use 
a sword engaged me to his grandson, Tenchi.  Yoiko lost her virginity 
to him, so the engagement was called off.  Not that I would have 
married him anyway.&quot;

	&quot;Well, I wouldn&#39;t let Pop hear about this.  It might give him 
ideas.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;I can handle him.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;Now, lets play tennis.&quot;

	Ranma went into the match expecting to win.  After all, they 
both knew who the better athlete was.  Unfortunately she wasn&#39;t having 
any luck.  Every time she served the ball, it went straight to Ranko, 
and every time Ranko served, Ranma would miss the ball by less than 
an inch.  It was almost as if Ranko was using magic to win.

	&quot;Ranko!&quot;  Ranma yelled.  &quot;Are you using magic to cheat?&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s not cheating.&quot;  Ranko answered.  &quot;You can use magic if 
you want.&quot;

	&quot;I don&#39;t know any magic!&quot;  Ranma shouted.

	&quot;Is that my fault?&quot;  Ranko asked, then saw the dirty look 
Ranma was giving her.  &quot;Okay, I won&#39;t use any more magic to win.&quot;

	&quot;How do I know you&#39;re not lying?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Goddesses can&#39;t lie.&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;It&#39;s against the rules.  
The Almighty is pretty strict about it.&quot;

	&quot;If you say so.&quot;  Ranma said.

	The next few matches were better.  Ranko turned out to be 
very good even without magic, but at least Ranma had a better chance 
of winning.  After a while they stopped for a breather, and noticed that 
several men and a few women were around the court watching them.

	&quot;Hey, Ranko?&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;I thought you said that if we 
had different hair styles then people wouldn&#39;t stare at us.&quot;

	&quot;They&#39;re not staring at us.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;They&#39;re staring at 
you.&quot;

	&quot;Huh?&quot;

	&quot;Watch the crowd.&quot;  Ranko said.  She got up and bounced on 
her toes a few times.

	&quot;They didn&#39;t do anything.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;Now do what I just did.&quot;  Ranko said.

	Ranma repeated her sister&#39;s actions and noticed that the 
crowd&#39;s eyes were going up and down, following her movements.

	&quot;You should have worn the bra.&quot;  Ranko said.

	Ranma blushed as she realized that they were watching her 
breasts bounce up and down.

	&quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s break for lunch.&quot;  Ranko said.

	A little while later they were in a diner down the street eating 
hamburgers.

	&quot;Are you going to tell me why you freaked out this morning?&quot;  
Ranko asked.  &quot;After all, that&#39;s no way to treat the girl you lost you&#39;re 
virginity to.&quot;

	&quot;Um...don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but I wasn&#39;t a virgin.&quot;  
Ranma replied.

	Ranko choked on her hamburger.  &quot;You weren&#39;t?!?&quot;

	&quot;Not exactly, I...&quot;  Ranma stopped when he noticed Ranko 
giggling.  &quot;What?&quot;

	&quot;Nabiki said that there was no way you could have done the 
deed without the whole world knowing.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;I can&#39;t wait to 
tell her.&quot;

	&quot;You can&#39;t do that!&quot;  Ranma shouted.  &quot;If you tell her then the 
whole world WILL know.  My life would be over.&quot;

	&quot;Relax.  She already knows about us.  I made her promise 
that she wouldn&#39;t use you&#39;re sex life to blackmail you.&quot;  Ranko replied.  
&quot;So, who beat me to the punch?  It was Shampoo, wasn&#39;t it?  Damn, 
what I wouldn&#39;t do to get a piece of that.&quot;

	&quot;It wasn&#39;t Shampoo.&quot;

	&quot;It couldn&#39;t have been Akane.  Was it Ukyo?  Kasumi?&quot;

	&quot;Kasumi?!?  You don&#39;t think she&#39;d actually do something like 
that.&quot;  Ranma was shocked.

	&quot;You&#39;d be surprised.&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;Well, who was it?&quot;

	&quot;It was me.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;Huh?&quot;  Ranko was confused.  &quot;Masturbating doesn&#39;t count as 
losing you&#39;re virginity.&quot;

	&quot;It didn&#39;t happen that way.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;Okay, a while 
back Happosai used some weird incense to separate my girl side from 
my guy side.  She disappeared, but came back on the following nights.&quot;

	&quot;So, was she good?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;I thought so at the time, but when we had sex she would 
drain off some of my energy.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;She was sort of my evil 
side come to life.&quot;

	&quot;Is that why you freaked this morning?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;Yeah.  The long hair.  The clothes.  The way you woke me 
up.  All of it was the same.&quot;  Ranma replied.

	&quot;Well, you don&#39;t have to worry about me sucking away your 
life-force.  The energy I get comes from the act itself, not from you 
personally.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;And you&#39;re not the only one who has been 
seduced by evil.&quot;

	&quot;What do you mean?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Well, there&#39;s a demoness out there who want&#39;s to do a whole 
bunch of nasty things to me, and she&#39;ll do just about anything to 
achieve her goal.&quot;  Ranko answered.

	&quot;Are you saying that we have to worry about a demoness 
attacking the dojo?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Mara usually spends most her time bugging Belldandy, so 
she shouldn&#39;t bother me now that I don&#39;t live there any more.&quot;  Ranko 
said.  &quot;At least, I hope so.&quot;

	Just then the waiter came buy and placed two hot fudge 
sundaes on their table.

	&quot;We didn&#39;t order these.&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;It&#39;s on the house, since your boyfriends aren&#39;t here to get 
them for you.&quot;  the waiter said.

	&quot;Gee thanks, mister.&quot;  Ranma said cutely and started to 
devour her sundae.

	&quot;We don&#39;t have boyfriends, though.&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;Really?&quot;  The waiter asked.  &quot;Well, maybe you could get 
together with me and a friend of mine later.&quot;

	&quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re up to it.&quot;  Ranko said, then turned to 
Ranma.  &quot;Ranma, you&#39;ve got ice cream all over your face.&quot;  she said.  
She leaned over the table, and in an extremely erotic gesture, proceeded 
to lick the ice cream off of Ranma&#39;s face.

	&quot;...&quot;  Both Ranma and the waiter were stunned into silence.

	&quot;You&#39;re drooling.&quot;  Ranko told the waiter.

	&quot;Um...well...I...gotta go.&quot;  the guy said and stumbled into the 
kitchen.

	&quot;I love doing that.&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;What was that all about?&quot;  Ranma asked, looking angry.

	&quot;Don&#39;t tell me you didn&#39;t enjoy that.&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;That&#39;s not the point.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;Were both girls right 
now.  I don&#39;t want people thinking I&#39;m a pervert.&quot;

	&quot;So I&#39;m a pervert because I like girls?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;Oops.  Sorry.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;That&#39;s okay.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;I am a pervert.  But not because 
I&#39;m gay.&quot;

	&quot;What ever.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;Just try to keep the show of 
affection to a minimum.  It&#39;s embarrassing.&quot;

	&quot;You&#39;re no fun.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	Later that night Ranma and Ranko returned to their room.  
Ranko burned some more incense like she did the night before.  
Ranma noticed that the scent was a bit stronger, but didn&#39;t mind.

	&quot;So, ready to get busy?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;Sure.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;Just let me take a shower to change 
back first.&quot;

	Ranko smiled and raised her hand.  The bathroom door 
slammed shut and locked from the inside.

	&quot;Ranko, this isn&#39;t funny.&quot;  Ranma said as she tried to get the 
bathroom door open.  &quot;I can&#39;t do anything like this.&quot;

	&quot;Come on, Sis.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;You know me well enough to 
know that that&#39;s not a problem.&quot;

	&quot;You don&#39;t mean...&quot;  Ranma said, taking note that Ranko 
referred to her as &#39;Sis&#39;.  &quot;No way!  I&#39;m a guy!&quot;

	&quot;Not right now, you&#39;re not.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;Besides, you&#39;ll 
want to know how to please a woman in that body.&quot;

	&quot;Why the hell would I want to know how to do that?!&quot;  
Ranma shouted.

	Ranko sighed.  &quot;You know that both me and Nabiki are 
bisexual, right?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah.&quot;  Ranma replied.

	&quot;Did you know that Kasumi is, too?&quot;

	&quot;No way!&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding.&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s true.&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;Why else would she keep it a 
secret that me and Nabiki are lovers?&quot;

	&quot;Wait a minute.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;You&#39;re not doing anything 
with her, are you?&quot;

	&quot;No.&quot;  Ranko answered.  &quot;I don&#39;t know the details, but 
apparently Kasumi had a girlfriend in high school.&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s always who you least suspect.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;And if Kasumi and Nabiki go that way, then there&#39;s a good 
chance that Akane will too.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;So when you get married, 
she might expect you to have sex with her as a girl.&quot;

	&quot;If we get married.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;I&#39;m still trying to get out 
of that.&quot;

	&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;I bet almost any girl you 
get involved with will want it both ways eventually.&quot;

	&quot;Not all girls are like you.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;They don&#39;t have to be.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;Anyone who knows 
the real you thinks of you as a man.  Just like anyone who knows the 
real me thinks of me as a woman.  It&#39;s one of the reasons that I could 
never get Yoiko to sleep with me.&quot;

	&quot;I wish you hadn&#39;t told me that.&quot;  Ranma said.  She didn&#39;t 
want to think about Ryoga&#39;s reaction to the idea that Ranko might have 
tried to have sex with his sister.  &quot;But you do have a point.  I really am 
a guy no matter what body I&#39;m in.  I couldn&#39;t fall in love with anybody 
who couldn&#39;t accept that.&quot;

	&quot;That&#39;s right.  You don&#39;t see Shampoo or Ukyo any less 
affectionate towards you when you&#39;re a girl.  But as far as I know they 
both think of themselves as straight.&quot;

	&quot;So what you&#39;re saying is that if a girl wants to have sex with 
me like this,&quot;  Ranma gestured to her body.  &quot;Then that doesn&#39;t make 
her a lesbian.&quot;

	&quot;Not necessarily.  It&#39;s just experimenting to find out what 
feels good.&quot;  Ranko replied and stepped closer to Ranma.  &quot;So, do you 
want to find out what feels good?&quot;  she asked with a seductive tone.

	Ranma thought for a moment.  She had felt good when she 
masturbated the day before.  And Ranko was an experienced lesbian, 
so she could probably make her feel even better.  &quot;Okay, you win.&quot;  
Ranma said.  &quot;But don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to give up sex as a guy.&quot;

	&quot;You won&#39;t regret it.&quot;  Ranko said and kissed Ranma deeply.  
Her hands slid up Ranma&#39;s skirt to caress her ass.

	Ranma stiffened in shock at Ranko&#39;s touch, then melted into 
the kiss.  It was so different from what it was like when she was a 
man.  She gasped as Ranko broke the kiss.

	&quot;It looks like you enjoyed that.&quot;  Ranko said, noticing 
Ranma&#39;s dazed expression.  &quot;Well, shall we continue?&quot;

	Ranma could only nod in response.  She didn&#39;t make a sound 
as Ranko led her to the bed and stripped them both of their clothes.  
Had she been thinking clearly, she would have been thankful to be rid 
of the panties.

	&quot;Maybe it&#39;s my ego,&quot;  Ranko said as she gazed at Ranma&#39;s 
nude form.  &quot;But that body is irresistible.&quot;  She kissed Ranma again, 
raising her hands to caress the girl&#39;s breasts.  Ranko broke the kiss 
and smiled at Ranma&#39;s startled gasp.

	Ranma moaned as Ranko continued to fondle her breasts. It 
felt even better than when she touched herself.  She found it hard to 
concentrate with the flashes of pleasure that Ranko was causing.

	&quot;My, aren&#39;t we sensitive?&quot;  Ranko said as she noticed 
Ranma&#39;s reactions.  &quot;Well, my hands aren&#39;t the only things I can use.&quot;  
She bent her head down to capture one of the hardened nipples in her 
mouth.

	Ranma gasped as the pleasure she was feeling was 
intensified.  She gripped the back of Ranko&#39;s head as she sucked on 
her breast.  Soon the new sensations pushed her over the edge.  &quot;I&#39;m 
coming!&quot;  she shouted.

	Ranko was surprised when she started to feel Ranma&#39;s body 
spasm.  &quot;You have got to be kidding.  I&#39;m good, but I&#39;m not that good.&quot;  
she said, then noticed that Ranma&#39;s eyes were beginning to glaze over.  
&quot;Don&#39;t zone out on me.  Girls last longer than that.&quot;  she said and 
snapped her fingers in front of Ranma&#39;s face.

	&quot;Wow.&quot;  Ranma said, because she couldn&#39;t think of anything 
else.

	&quot;You really did come, didn&#39;t you?&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;Only 
Takami has ever been able to get me off with just my tits.&quot;

	&quot;Who?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	Ranko put her finger to Ranma&#39;s lips.  &quot; Later.&quot;  she said as 
she pushed Ranma back on the bed.  She kissed down Ranma&#39;s body 
until she was between her legs.  She reached out her tongue and tasted 
the juices that were already flowing  out of Ranma&#39;s sex.

	&quot;Oh God...&quot;  Ranma moaned as Ranko latched on to her clit 
and began sucking.  She was so caught up in what she was feeling that 
she didn&#39;t notice when Ranko slipped a finger into her pussy.  She did 
notice, however, when Ranko made contact with her hymen.  &quot;Aaah!&quot;  
she yelled and shoved Ranko away.

	&quot;Ranma?  Are you okay?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;No. There&#39;s something wrong with my body.&quot;  Ranma 
answered.

	&quot;Wrong?&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong.&quot;

	&quot;Yes there is.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;Something&#39;s blocking the way 
inside.&quot;

	&quot;You mean your hymen?&quot;  Ranko asked.  &quot;All girls are born 
with one of those.&quot;

	&quot;Huh?&quot;  Ranma remembered the previous night.  &quot;You don&#39;t 
have one.&quot;

	&quot;Of course not, stupid.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;Having a hymen is a 
sign of virginity.  I haven&#39;t been a virgin since my sixteenth birthday.&quot;

	&quot;Then, you mean...&quot;

	That&#39;s right.&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;We&#39;re going to have to break 
through that barrier to get to the real pleasure.&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s gonna hurt, isn&#39;t it?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Not much, compared to some of the blows I hear you&#39;ve 
taken.&quot;  Ranko answered.  &quot;But everybody goes through it, and I 
guarantee it&#39;s worth it.&quot;

	&quot;Well, I guess if I have to.&quot;  Ranma said reluctantly.

	&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll make it as easy as possible.&quot;  Ranko said, 
resuming her place between Ranma&#39;s legs.  She started licking at her 
sex again, quickly returning Ranma to the aroused state she was in 
before.  When she sensed that Ranma was about to come, she placed 
two fingers in Ranma&#39;s pussy.  &quot;Ready?&quot;  she asked.

	&quot;Yeah.&quot;  Ranma replied and braced herself.  Ranko thrust her 
fingers into Ranma&#39;s pussy, breaking her hymen and plunging in deep.  The 
sharp pain was enough to make Ranma come.  When her orgasm 
subsided she realized that Ranko was still thrusting her fingers in and 
out of her pussy.  She was about to protest when she came again.  Still, 
Ranko didn&#39;t stop.  Ranma clenched her eyes shut as Ranko 
manipulated her body.  Then, as Ranma felt her third orgasm begin to 
form, Ranko stopped.  Ranma felt her sister shift her position.  She 
opened her eyes to find herself staring at Ranko&#39;s pussy

	&quot;You don&#39;t expect me to do all the work, do you?&quot;  Ranko 
asked.

	&quot;You mean, you want me to...&quot;

	&quot;I told you yesterday that we&#39;d get to this.&quot;  Ranko replied.  
&quot;So, unless you think we should stop for the night, I suggest you get to 
work.&quot;

	Ranma knew that she couldn&#39;t stop.  She desperately needed 
to get off one more time.  If they stopped, she would end up 
masturbating untill she came, and it wouldn&#39;t be as good as what 
Ranko could do.  &quot;Okay, but I&#39;ve never done this before, so don&#39;t be 
mad if I&#39;m not that good.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do fine.&quot;  Ranko said.

	With that bit of reassurance, Ranma began her work.  She 
started by gently licking the outer lips of Ranko&#39;s sex, then dug in 
deeper when she felt Ranko resume fingering her.

	&quot;Good.  Now try sucking on my clit.&quot;  Ranko suggested, then 
realized that Ranma probably wouldn&#39;t know what she was referring to.  
&quot;It&#39;s that little hard bit at the top.&quot;

	Since she was looking at Ranko&#39;s pussy upside down, Ranma 
had a little difficulty following her directions, buy eventually she 
located Ranko&#39;s clit.  It almost looks like a tiny cock, she thought.  She 
quickly banished the image from her mind.  She took the clit in her 
mouth and gently sucked, remembering how sensitive the little nub of 
flesh was when she touched herself.

	&quot;Goo...ah!  Good.&quot;  Ranko cooed.  &quot;Now use your...ooh...your 
fingers.

	Ranma slid two fingers easily into the wet flesh of Ranko&#39;s 
sex.  She heard Ranko moan and then gasped as Ranko sped up her 
own actions.  Ranma duplicated Ranko&#39;s actions as best as she could.

	&quot;More!  Faster!&quot;  Ranko pleaded.  Ranko complied and a few 
seconds later she came.  As she orgasmed she thrust her fingers deep 
into Ranma, forcing her to come as well.  After the feeling subsided, 
Ranko noticed that Ranma had stopped her actions.  She got off 
Ranma&#39;s body and turned around untill she was lying next to her.

	&quot;That was amazing.&quot;  Ranma said after she caught her breath.

	&quot;I told you it would be.&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;Although you came 
four times and I only got off once.  I should feel insulted.&quot;

	&quot;Oops.  Sorry.&quot;  Ranma said, looking ashamed.

	&quot;That&#39;s okay.  I&#39;m not greedy.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;Besides, you&#39;re 
just a beginner.  You need to make up for lost time.&quot;

	&quot;Thanks, Sis.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;Any time.&quot;  Ranko said and turned off the light.  Soon they 
drifted off to sleep.

	Ranma awoke to find her head resting between two warm, 
soft objects.  She lifted her head and found out that the objects were a 
pair of breasts.  She panicked out of habit and leapt off the bed.  Then 
she saw who the breasts belonged to and relaxed.  Ranko was sleeping 
quietly with a little smile on her lips.  She looks peaceful, Ranma 
thought.  Not like when she&#39;s awake.  &quot;She looks like an angel.&quot;  she 
said out loud.

	Suddenly, Ranko&#39;s eyes snapped open.  A katana appeared in 
her hand as she leapt out of bed.  She swung the sword and missed 
Ranma&#39;s head by a fraction of an inch.  She was about to attack again 
when she realized who was on the receiving end of her blade.  &quot;Oh.  
Good morning, Ranma.&quot;

	&quot;You tried to kill me!&quot;  Ranma shouted.

	&quot;If I was trying to kill you , you&#39;d already be dead.&quot;  Ranko 
replied.

	&quot;Then just what were you trying to do?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;You interrupted a really good dream.  I get a little upset when 
that happens.&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;And I don&#39;t like being called Angel, 
either.&quot;

	Ranma decided not to ask.  &quot;Okay, just don&#39;t let it happen 
again.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;ll try not to.&quot;  Ranko answered.  &quot;Now let&#39;s take a shower.  
I want to get an early start today.&quot;

	In the bathroom, Ranma stepped into the shower and sighed 
as the hot water changed him back into a man.

	&quot;You don&#39;t have to act so relieved.&quot;  Ranko said as she 
stepped into the shower.  &quot;I mean, you were enjoying being a girl last 
night.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, but I spent the whole day as a girl.  It&#39;s good to change 
back to normal.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad you put up with me yesterday.&quot;  Ranko said.  
&quot;It helped a lot.&quot;

	&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

	&quot;Well, you&#39;re the first man I&#39;ve ever chosen to sleep with more 
than once.&quot;  Ranko answered.

	&quot;What about that guy you were living with?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Keiichi?  I don&#39;t count him because Belldandy was with us 
whenever we had sex.&quot;  Ranko answered.  &quot;If she didn&#39;t love him, I 
probably wouldn&#39;t have let him join us.&quot;

	&quot;So you&#39;re saying that you would rather have me as a girl?&quot;  
Ranma asked.

	&quot;You&#39;re my brother, so I&#39;ll always think of you as a guy.  And 
I won&#39;t make you have sex as a girl all the time.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;But 
it&#39;s nice to know that I have that option.&quot;

	&quot;I guess being bisexual gets complicated.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;You have no idea.&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;Speaking of 
complications, we&#39;re going to the beach today, so we might as well 
change now.&quot;

	&quot;Okay.&quot;  Ranma said.  He turned off the hot water and gasped 
as the cold water hit him and changed him into a girl.  She heard a 
similar gasp as Ranko turned male.

	&quot;I never knew taking a cold shower could be this much fun.&quot;  
Ranko-kun said with a grin as he stepped out of the shower.

	&quot;You think a cold shower is fun?&quot;  Ranma-chan asked as she 
got out of the shower and grabbed the towel that Ranma handed her.

	&quot;Sure.&quot;  Ranko answered.  &quot;I mean, I start taking a shower 
with a guy that was sort of cute, and ended up with a beautiful 
woman.&quot;

	&quot;I knew you&#39;d say something like that.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;And 
what do you mean &#39;sort of cute&#39;?&quot;

	&quot;Well, we&#39;ve got the same body, so you be the judge.&quot;  Ranko 
said.  &quot;Do you find me attractive as a guy?&quot;

	Ranma paused.  On one hand, she did consider herself a 
handsome man.  On the other hand, she couldn&#39;t find another man 
attractive, even if the man was really her sister.  &quot;I&#39;m not gonna answer 
that.&quot;  she said finally.

	&quot;Fine.  Be that way.&quot;  Ranko replied.  After they dried off, 
they got dressed in their swimsuits.  Ranko wore a pair of plain green 
swim trunks, and Ranma wore her usual one-piece.

	&quot;After yesterday, I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t try to get me into a 
bikini.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;Hey, I used to look great in a string bikini.&quot;  Ranko replied.  
&quot;And is it really necessary to advertise the fact that you&#39;re a guy?&quot;  he 
asked as he gestured to the word &#39;BOY&#39; written across the front of 
Ranma&#39;s suit.

	&quot;At least you don&#39;t have a problem with guys hitting on you at 
the beach.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;Oh, I wouldn&#39;t say that.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;I&#39;ve had a few 
offers.&quot;

	&quot;You didn&#39;t!  Ranma said with a shocked tone.

	&quot;Of course not.&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;I only have sex as a guy 
with girls I really like, and I haven&#39;t found a guy that was worth it.&quot;  
He paused for a moment.  &quot;Well, maybe one guy.  But that was before 
I got cursed.&quot;

	&quot;I don&#39;t want to know.&quot;  Ranma said, sounding faintly 
disgusted.

	A little while later they were at the beach behind the hotel.

	&quot;Going topless at the beach isn&#39;t any fun when you&#39;re a guy.&quot;  
Ranko complained as he put on some sun screen.

	&quot;Hey, Ranko?  What were you dreaming?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Huh?&quot;

	&quot;This morning you said that I interrupted a really good 
dream.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;So what was it?&quot;

	&quot;Oh.  I was in a four-way with Nabiki, Yoiko, and Takami.&quot;  
Ranko answered bluntly.

	&quot;I wish you wouldn&#39;t fantasize about Ryoga&#39;s sister.&quot;  Ranma 
said.  &quot;He&#39;s mad enough as it is without you adding to the problem.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m not the only one.  Yoiko&#39;s got dozens of female 
admirers.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;I keep telling her she&#39;s wasting herself on 
men.&quot;

	&quot;Dozens?!&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Yeah.  I&#39;ll give her one month before she got local girl 
infatuated and hanging around Ucchan&#39;s&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;But me 
and Takami are the only ones that ever came close to actually getting 
anywhere with her.&quot;

	&quot;Who is this Takami, anyway?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	A dreamy look came over Ranko&#39;s face.  &quot;She&#39;s the most 
wonderful woman in the world.&quot;

	&quot;Old girlfriend?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Not just any old girlfriend.&quot;  Ranko answered.  &quot;She&#39;s my 
first lover.  The girl I lost my virginity to.&quot;

	&quot;Sounds like you liked her a lot?&quot;

	&quot;I didn&#39;t like her.  I loved her.  I still do love her.  I would die 
for her.  I would kill for her.  I would do anything she asked.&quot;  Ranko&#39;s 
face became sad.  &quot;Except for the one thing she did ask.&quot;

	&quot;What happened?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;She asked me to share her love with another.&quot;  Ranko 
replied.

	&quot;You mean another woman?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Yeah.  She fell in love with some blonde on a racing 
motorcycle.&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;She wanted my help in seducing her.  
But I couldn&#39;t do that.&quot;

	&quot;Excuse me?&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;No offense, but from what 
you&#39;ve been telling me over the past couple of days, more than one 
person isn&#39;t a problem for you.&quot;

	&quot;Groups can be nice.  But I realized that I would never have 
Takami all to myself.&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;You see, Takami has a lot of 
lovers.  Practically a harem, in fact.  And it&#39;s not just sex.  She&#39;s in love 
with all of them.&quot;

	&quot;So you two broke up?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Not exactly.&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;We still go out on dates 
when I&#39;m in the neighborhood.&quot;

	&quot;What about the other woman?&quot;

	&quot;Well, she does invite some of her harem occasionally.  And 
there&#39;s nothing wrong with a good orgy.  But never with the blonde.&quot;  
Ranko replied.  &quot;I made Takami promise never to tell me her name, 
for fear that I might track her down and kill her in a jealous rage.&quot;

	Ranma&#39;s eye&#39;s widened.  She didn&#39;t want to believe that Ranko 
was capable of such a thing, but the way he had said it left little doubt.

	&quot;Hey, Ranma?  Want to rent a rowboat?&quot;  Ranko asked, 
changing the subject.

	&quot;Sure.&quot;  Ranma said, not wanting to continue the discussion of 
Ranko&#39;s homicidal urges.

	A short while later they were on the ocean.

	&quot;Just a man and a woman, out here alone.  Isn&#39;t this 
romantic?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;It would be a lot more romantic if you weren&#39;t the man, or 
my sister.&quot;  Ranma replied.

	&quot;But, I wouldn&#39;t be having nearly as much fun if I was here 
with a man.&quot;

	&quot;I am a man!&quot;  Ranma responded as usual, then thought of 
something she wanted to ask.  &quot;Hey, how did you get started with 
guys, anyway?  It sounds to me like you&#39;d be happy with just girls.&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s Yoiko&#39;s fault.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	&quot;What?&quot;

	&quot;Well, after Takami and I parted ways, I set my sights on 
Yoiko.&quot;  Ranko explained.  &quot;I guess I&#39;ve always loved her, I just never 
realized it before then.  But, unfortunately, Yoiko is as straight as an 
arrow.&quot;

	&quot;And she didn&#39;t like it that you wanted her, did she?&quot;

	&quot;Nope.  We argued, and I told her that sex with men was 
horrible.&quot;  Ranko held up a hand, stopping Ranma from protesting his 
last remark.  &quot;She asked me how I knew.  I realized that all my 
information came from Takami, who was just as inexperienced with 
men as I was.  So Yoiko made me a bet.&quot;

	&quot;A bet?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Uh-huh.  She challenged me to have sex with a man.  If it 
was as awful as Takami said it would be, then Yoiko would make love 
to me.  But if it was better than a woman, then I had to stop trying to 
seduce her.&quot;

	&quot;So what did you do?&quot;

	&quot;Well, my first thought was to strip naked and walk through 
the bad part of town, hoping I&#39;d get raped...&quot;

	&quot;What!!!&quot;  Ranma shouted.

	&quot;But Yoiko said that wouldn&#39;t count because nobody would 
enjoy that.&quot;  Ranko continued.  &quot;So after several botched attempts to 
get laid like a normal person,  I ended up in Ryugenzawa.&quot;

	&quot;Ryugenzawa?&quot;  Ranma asked.  She remembered her own trip 
there.

	&quot;Yeah.  Do you know they have a bunch of giant monsters 
there?  Well, anyway, Yoiko and I ran into this old man in the forests.  
It was late so we stayed at his house.  He hears us arguing about the 
bet, and he tells us that his grandson was mortally wounded, and he 
didn&#39;t want him to die a virgin.&quot;

	&quot;An old guy with a grandson who was dying?&quot;  Ranma asked.  
This was sounding way too familiar.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah.  So I figure it&#39;s now or never.  I offer to make his last 
days worth while.  Lucky for me, this guy has the world&#39;s worst 
memory, so I pretended to be his wife.  And he bought it hook, line 
and sinker.&quot;

	&quot;Wait a minute.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;What was this guy&#39;s name?&quot;

	&quot;Shinnosuke.  Why?&quot;

	Ranma fell overboard.

	&quot;Ranma!&quot;  Ranko shouted and dived overboard to save his 
brother.  Ranma was coughing up water as Ranko pulled her back on 
the boat.  Soon the coughing and sputtering gave way to laughter.  
&quot;Did I miss something?&quot;  he asked.

	&quot;You slept with Shinnosuke.&quot;  Ranma said, and broke out in 
another fit of laughter.

	&quot;Wait a minute.  You know him?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah.&quot;  Ranma answered.  &quot;He had a major crush on 
Akane.&quot;

	&quot;Well, he&#39;s dead now, so it doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;He&#39;s not dead.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;He got cured.&quot;

	&quot;He&#39;s not dead!&quot;  Ranko shouted.  &quot;Why that little...  To think 
I almost killed myself because of him.  I swear, if I wasn&#39;t a goddess...&quot;

	&quot;What do you mean, you almost killed yourself?&quot;  Ranma 
interrupted.

	&quot;The morning after I had sex with him, I was a wreck.&quot;  
Ranko answered.  &quot;I was so depressed, I almost threw myself off a 
cliff.  Luckily, Yoiko was there to stop me.&quot;

	&quot;Shinnosuke was that bad in bed?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;No.  He was good.  Great, even.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	&quot;Then what was the problem?&quot;

	&quot;That one moment of pleasure shattered all the beliefs that I 
had about my sexuality.  Lesbians by definition don&#39;t enjoy sex with 
men.  But I did.  So I couldn&#39;t be a lesbian.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;But I still 
loved Takami and Yoiko.  So I couldn&#39;t be straight.&quot;

	&quot;Sounds like you were pretty mixed up.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;How 
did you get it all sorted out?&quot;

	&quot;Yoiko asked me who was better, men or women.&quot;  Ranko 
said.  &quot;Then I realized that we both lost the bet, because sex with men 
wasn&#39;t awful, but it wasn&#39;t better than sex with women, either.&quot;  He 
grinned.  &quot;As strange as it sounds, it was Yoiko&#39;s idea for me to go 
both ways.&quot;

	&quot;But you still lost the bet.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;Yoiko wouldn&#39;t 
sleep with you.&quot;

	&quot;Now that you mention it, we did make out that night.&quot;  
Ranko said.

	&quot;But you said you and she never...&quot;

	&quot;We didn&#39;t go all the way.&quot;  Ranko interrupted.  &quot;She 
wouldn&#39;t  let me touch her below the waist.  Unfortunately she isn&#39;t as 
easy to get off as you are.  But I had fun.  I think she did too, even 
though she&#39;ll deny it if you ask her.&quot;

	&quot;Especially since you&#39;re still after her.&quot;  Ranma added.

	&quot;I&#39;ll admit that I do hit on her once in a while, and she can 
bribe me pretty easy with kisses.  But I&#39;m not as bad as I used to be.  I 
guess I&#39;ve accepted the fact that she&#39;s going to fall in love with a man 
and get married someday.&quot;

	&quot;Hey, can we go back now?  I&#39;m hungry.&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;I guess the way to a man&#39;s heart really is through his 
stomach.&quot;  Ranko commented as he rowed ashore.

	After a few more hours at the beach, Ranko and Ranma 
returned to their room.

	Ranma watched as Ranko burned some incense again.  She 
noticed that the scent was a lot stronger that the previous night.  She 
breathed in the perfumed smoke and felt strange, but in a good way.  
&quot;So, how do you want me tonight?&quot;  Ranma asked, trying to sound 
seductive, and judging from Ranko&#39;s laughter, failing miserably.

	&quot;I think I&#39;ll take you as is.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	&quot;Then I guess I&#39;ll have to find something to keep myself busy 
while you&#39;re in the shower.&quot;  Ranma said.  She grabbed a breast 
through her swimsuit and ran a hand over her groin to show Ranko 
what she had in mind.

	Ranko glanced at the incense burner.  Maybe I used too 
much, he thought.  &quot;Nice idea, but not necessary.  I&#39;m not taking a 
shower.&quot;

	&quot;What?&quot;  Ranma asked, not sure that she heard him right.

	&quot;I&#39;m staying male tonight.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	It took a few seconds to comprehend what Ranko was saying.  
Once she did, she could decide on only one course of action.

	She ran.

	&quot;Guess I didn&#39;t use enough.&quot;  Ranko said to himself as she 
saw Ranma bolt for the door.  He grabbed her before she could make 
it.

	&quot;LET GO!!!&quot;  Ranma shouted as she struggled.

	Damn, Ranko thought.  Even as a girl he&#39;s a lot stronger than 
me.  &quot;I didn&#39;t want to use this.&quot;  He said and jabbed his thumb just 
behind Ranma&#39;s left ear.  She immediately stopped struggling.

	&quot;What did you do?&quot;  Ranma asked.  Her fear was still there, 
but it wasn&#39;t nearly as strong.

	&quot;Shiatsu Calmness Point.&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;Think of it as 
turning your emotional volume down a couple notches.&quot;

	&quot;Are you gonna rape me?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;I&#39;ve never had to rape anyone before.  I don&#39;t see why I 
should start now.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;Although I will admit that I had a 
little help getting you in the sack before.&quot;  He gestured to the incense 
burner.

	&quot;The incense?&quot;

	&quot;It relaxes inhibitions.&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;It doesn&#39;t affect me 
much because I don&#39;t have very many taboos as it is.  But I don&#39;t think 
you would have had sex with your sister, or as a girl, without it.&quot;

	&quot;I still don&#39;t wanna have sex with you when you&#39;re a man.&quot;  
Ranma stated.

	&quot;Why not?&quot;

	&quot;Because I&#39;m a guy.&quot;  Ranma said, because she could work up 
enough anger to shout it.

	&quot;You&#39;re a guy?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;  Ranma replied.

	&quot;Then what are those?&quot;  Ranko asked, pointing to Ranma&#39;s 
breasts.

	&quot;It don&#39;t matter.&quot;  Ranma replied.  &quot;I&#39;m still a guy.&quot;

	&quot;So you&#39;re saying that if a guy falls in a cursed spring, it 
doesn&#39;t change the fact that he&#39;s still a guy.&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;Yeah.&quot;

	&quot;But I suppose that doesn&#39;t apply to me.&quot;  Ranko said.

	Ranma mentally kicked herself.  She had been treating Ranko 
as if he was a real boy.  &quot;Oh God, Ranko.  I&#39;m sorry.  I didn&#39;t  mean it 
like that.&quot;

	&quot;That&#39;s okay.&quot;  Ranko said, choking back a few tears.  &quot;I 
know you think I&#39;m a freak.&quot;

	&quot;I could never think that.&quot;  Ranma said as she wrapped her 
arms around Ranko in an effort to comfort him.

	&quot;But you don&#39;t think of me as a real girl.&quot;  Ranko sobbed.

	&quot;Of course I do.&quot;  Ranma said.  &quot;If it makes you feel better, 
we can have sex like this.&quot;

	&quot;Sucker.&quot;  Ranko said with a grin.  His mood immediately 
brightened.

	&quot;You...tricked me?&quot;  Ranko asked in shock.

	&quot;Just because goddesses can&#39;t lie doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t be sneaky.&quot;  Ranko
said.

	&quot;Why you...&quot;

	&quot;Well, that pressure point should have worn off by now.&quot;  
Ranko said.  &quot;So, are you still afraid?&quot;

	Ranma thought for a moment.  &quot;Hey, I&#39;m not.&quot;  she said in 
surprise.

	&quot;Good.  You shouldn&#39;t be.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;If you say you&#39;re a 
real guy, then that makes me a real girl.  You can&#39;t have it both ways.&quot;

	&quot;But I thought you wanted me to have it both ways.&quot;  Ranma 
said innocently.  She grabbed Ranko and kissed him passionately.

	&quot;...&quot;  Ranko was stunned.

	Ranma looked at the expression on Ranko&#39;s face and laughed.  
&quot;You didn&#39;t expect me to just lay back and get fucked, did you?&quot;  she 
asked as she shoved Ranko back so he landed on the bed.

	&quot;Well, I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be so...enthusiastic.&quot;  Ranko 
replied as Ranma stripped off her swimsuit.

	&quot;I&#39;m not the only one.&quot;  Ranma said as she tore off Ranko&#39;s 
trunks to find his manhood at full attention.

	Ranko had to admit that Ranma&#39;s rough treatment was 
turning him on.  He was worried about her change in attitude, though.  
&quot;Are you feeling okay?&quot;  he asked.

	&quot;Hey!  I just figured that if I&#39;m gonna do this, I might as well 
go all out.&quot;  Ranma replied as she began to stroke Ranko&#39;s shaft.  &quot;But 
don&#39;t get me wrong.  I&#39;m only gonna try this once.  If I don&#39;t like it, I 
ain&#39;t gonna do it again.&quot;

	&quot;I can live with that.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;So do you know what to 
do?&quot;

	&quot;I haven&#39;t been ignoring you the past couple days.&quot;  Ranma 
said.  She quickly engulfed his cock, but due to her lack of experience, 
she gagged and pulled back.

	Ranko suppressed a giggle.  &quot;Don&#39;t push yourself.  Deep 
throating takes a lot of practice to learn.&quot;  he said.  &quot;Nabiki can barely 
do it herself.&quot;

	Ranma didn&#39;t like the face that Nabiki could do something 
that she couldn&#39;t, but took Ranko&#39;s advice.  This time she didn&#39;t try to 
take more than a few inches in, using her hand to pump the remaining 
portion.  Soon she felt Ranko&#39;s cock pulse as it filled her mouth with 
cum.

	Ranko saw Ranma&#39;s eyes widen in shock when he came.  The 
look on her face told him that she didn&#39;t like the taste.  &quot;I&#39;m not going 
to make you swallow if you don&#39;t want to.&quot;  he said.

	Ranma spit into her hand and wiped it off on the sheets.  
&quot;Yuck.  I think I just discovered one of Akane&#39;s secret ingredients.&quot;  
she said.

	&quot;Now that you mention it, Skuld was working on a way to 
make semen taste like ice cream.&quot;  Ranko said, then shuttered.  &quot;Rocky 
Road still gives me nightmares.&quot;

	Ranma burst into laughter.  &quot;Could have been worse.  Could 
have been Death by Chocolate.&quot;

	&quot;Fine.  Laugh at my pain.&quot;

	&quot;Sorry.&quot;  Ranma said, then looked down at Ranko&#39;s limp 
penis.  &quot;Hey!  You&#39;ve gone soft on me.&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s not my fault you guy&#39;s got defective equipment.&quot;  Ranko 
replied.

	&quot;We do not!&quot;  Ranma shouted.

	&quot;As a girl my record is 106 orgasms without taking a break.  
But as a guy the most I could have without losing my hard on is 
three.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;I don&#39;t know about you, but I&#39;d call that 
defective.&quot;

	&quot;106!?!&quot;  Ranko yelled.  &quot;That would kill a man!&quot;

	&quot;My point exactly.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	&quot;Well, what are we gonna do untill you get hard again?&quot;  
Ranma asked.

	&quot;Make sure you&#39;re ready.&quot;  Ranko replied.  He grabbed 
Ranma&#39;s hips and moved her untill she straddled his head.  He noticed 
that she wasn&#39;t very wet.  I&#39;ll fix that, he thought, and started eating 
out Ranko&#39;s pussy.

	&quot;Oh, yeah...&quot;  Ranma moaned and ground her sex against 
Ranko&#39;s face.  She grabbed her breasts and started fondling them.  She 
was glad that oral sex was something that Ranko was good at in either 
gender.

	He&#39;s really getting into this, Ranko thought as he heard 
Ranma moans and gasps mixed with words of encouragement.  Once 
Ranma was wet enough, he stopped his actions.

	&quot;Why did you stop?  I was almost there.&quot;  Ranko said, 
sounding offended.

	&quot;I think you&#39;re missing the point.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;I could have 
stayed a girl to do this.&quot;

	Ranma looked over her shoulder to see that Ranko&#39;s manhood 
had regained it&#39;s hardness.  &quot;Oh, yeah.  I almost forgot.&quot;  She grasped 
Ranko&#39;s cock and positioned herself so that it was grazing the lips of 
her sex.

	&quot;If you want to back out now, I won&#39;t hold it against you.&quot;  
Ranko said.  &quot;I don&#39;t want you to do anything you&#39;ll regret.&quot;

	Ranma didn&#39;t answer.  She locked eyes with Ranko and 
slowly lowered herself on to his cock, letting it part the moist flesh as 
it traveled deep into her body.  &quot;Oh...my...God...&quot;  she moaned as it 
reached new depths.  As soon as Ranko was fully inside of her she 
came, spasming violently.

	Ranko gritted his teeth as Ranma orgasmed.  Even for a 
virgin, she was unbelievably tight.  And when she came she clamped 
down on him like a vise.  He knew he could come any second if he 
didn&#39;t control himself.

	Ranma came back to her senses after her orgasm to realize 
that she was still impaled on Ranko&#39;s manhood.  She raised herself up 
and thrust back, gasping as she was filled again.  Deciding that she 
liked the feeling, she repeated her actions.

	Ranko knew he couldn&#39;t last much longer, but wanted to get 
Ranma off a couple more times.  He grabbed her hips and started 
thrusting up in time with her movements.  After a few minutes of this, 
Ranma orgasmed for a second time.  It was harder for Ranko to hold 
back this time, so moments after Ranma&#39;s orgasm subsided, he came.

	A panicked look crossed Ranma&#39;s face as she felt Ranko&#39;s 
cock start to pulse inside of her.  She made a frantic attempt to get off 
of him, but was too late.  When she felt his hot cum spray her insides, 
She came for a third time and passed out.

	&quot;Ranma?&quot;  Ranko said as Ranma&#39;s unconscious body fell 
against him.  He quickly pulled out and laid her back on the bed.  He 
grabbed her wrist and felt for her pulse.  Satisfied that she didn&#39;t die 
on him, he pulled the covers over her.  &quot;I wonder if this is a good sign 
or a bad sign?&quot;  He asked himself.  &quot;Well, better safe than sorry.&quot;  he 
said and grabbed a pillow off the bed.  He slept on the floor that night.

	Ranma awoke the next morning to find herself in an empty 
bed.  &quot;Ranko?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah?&quot;  came Ranko&#39;s voice from the floor by the bed.

	Ranma looked over the edge of the bed to see Ranko lying on 
the floor staring at the ceiling.  &#39;You didn&#39;t have to sleep on the floor.&quot;  
she said.

	&quot;I wasn&#39;t sure what mood you&#39;d be in, so I didn&#39;t take any 
chances.&quot;  Ranko replied.  He made a strange face.

	&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Nature calls.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;Hey, call room service and 
order us some breakfast.&quot;  he said as he entered the bathroom.

	Ranma dialed room service and ordered something cheap.  
She was a little reluctant to spent the money after learning of Ranko&#39;s 
&#39;job&#39; in Hong Kong.  She ordered a kettle of hot water in case Ranko 
got any funny ideas about not letting her change back.

	&quot;That&#39;s one advantage men have over women.&quot;  Ranko said as 
he exited the bathroom.

	&quot;What is?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Being able to take a piss standing up.&quot;  Ranko answered.

	&quot;I&#39;m sorry I asked.&quot;

	Soon room service arrived with their breakfast.  Ranko noticed 
the kettle.  &quot;Are you that desperate to change back?&quot;  he asked.

	&quot;Two days straight as a girl is too much for me.&quot;  Ranma 
replied and poured the kettle over her head, changing back to a man.

	&quot;I just wanted to show you that you could have fun as a girl.&quot;  
Ranko said.

	&quot;Uh huh.  And recharging didn&#39;t  have anything to do with 
it?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;That reminds me.  You have to evaluate my performance.&quot;

	&quot;I have to what?&quot;  Ranma asked, sounding confused.

	&quot;Well, we&#39;re going to have to keep having sex at least until I 
finish my training.  That might take a while, so it would help if I knew 
what you liked.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;So, what did you like the most?&quot;

	&quot;I liked sex as a guy a lot.&quot;  Ranma answered.  &quot;But I could 
definitely get used to doing it girl/girl.&quot;

	&quot;What about me as a guy and you as a girl?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;I...wouldn&#39;t mind doing that again.&quot;  Ranma said in a small 
voice.

	&quot;Really?&quot;  Ranko asked with a grin.  &quot;Would you like me to 
work some magic on Ryoga?  He&#39;s almost as cute as his sister.&quot;

	&quot;Hey!  It&#39;s different with us because I know you&#39;re really a 
girl!&quot;  Ranma yelled.  &quot;And remember to pull out next time.  Feeling 
you come inside me is just too weird.&quot;

	&quot;I can manage that.&quot;  Ranko said, then a mischievous look 
crossed her face.  &quot;If you want to stay another night, there&#39;s one more 
thing we could try.&quot;

	&quot;What?  Some new positions?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	&quot;Not exactly.&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;Then what?&quot;  Ranma asked.  The first night he was a guy 
and she was a girl.  The second night they were both girls.  Then he 
was a girl and she was a guy.  Then that left...  &quot;You can&#39;t mean...&quot;

	Ranko-kun just smiled.

	Ranma covered his mouth and ran to the bathroom.

	&quot;I was only joking.&quot;  Ranko said as she heard the sound of 
Ranma vomiting into the toilet.

-------------------------------------------------

Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.

Reports of my suffering from a combination of writer&#39;s block and 
laziness are true.  At least it&#39;s done.

Thanks to Dave Eddy for giving me a place to post my fic.  And for 
writing Wild Child.  Read it, it&#39;s good.

Thanks to Stoner for nagging me for months to get this fic done.

Thanks to Ranko-chan for sending me a BIG arigato when I told her I 
was almost done.

Send questions, comments, suggestions, etc. Avoid flames,
though, because they will only encourage me.

I&#39;ll start writing the next chapter soon.

Speaking of which...

Next episode:  Ranko and Yoiko enroll at Furinkan, and get sent 
straight to the Principals office.  Ranko learns that you shouldn&#39;t insult 
you&#39;re teacher if she can drain you&#39;re battle aura.  Yoiko learns that 
she&#39;s attracted to guys with really big bokens.  See you next time for 
&#39;Delinquent&#39;.

Also coming soon...

Tales of the Lost Sisters:  Last Shred of Innocence.
