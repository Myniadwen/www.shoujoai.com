<h1>Akane, Wo Ai Ni</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dragonhealer.html">Dragonhealer</a><br> </h2>
<pre>A scream is let loose as eighteen-year-old Akane Tendo finally climaxed, 
reaching yet another powerful orgasm, her pussy squirting out fresh 
juices all over Shampoo&#39;s face, who had positioned herself in front of 
the tomboy, her tongue flickering out expertly to clean off Akane&#39;s 
gleaming sex which was shining in the light, relishing in both her taste 
and sounds of pleasure. Both were naked, wet, sweating and in Shampoo&#39;s 
room, on the floor. The Cat Caf&eacute; was closed for the night that late 
Friday evening. Nobody else was around, and Cologne was out on a visit 
back to China.

Akane laid her head back, panting heavily, gasping for air, a few moans 
of sheer pleasure escaping her lips feeling the Amazon licking her 
clean. Her mind was reeling and her were dazed, staring up at the 
ceiling. The repeated thumping of her heartbeat was loud and clear. 
Shampoo crawled forward, gives Akane&#39;s a few soft and gentle licks, and 
laid down next to her, pulling the tomboy into a warm embrace, licking 
her cheek like a kitten, pressing her own slick body against hers.

Her breathing slowing down and her vision focusing, Akane shifted her 
weight a little, turning her head so that her eyes met the Amazon&#39;s. 
&quot;Shampoo....&quot; she whispers, finding herself falling more in love with 
the Chinese girl. Shampoo smiled and kissed Akane&#39;s lips briefly. 
&quot;Akane, wo ai ni.&quot; She reached out a hand to cup one of Akane&#39;s breasts, 
squeezing it gently. A soft moan is heard and Akane smiled. &quot;I...I love 
you, too.&quot; Sliding an arm around Shampoo she lets out a sigh of 
happiness. Her eyes closed and she thought about the last two years.

Akane had grown into a pretty young woman at age eighteen. Her figure 
had improved, her hair had grown longer, and even Ranma Saotome had 
noticed this despite his ignorance. It was not long before Akane 
realized that there was indeed something very odd about the way she 
looked at Ranma in his female form. That beautiful red hair. Those cute 
eyes. That busty figure. That adorable voice. She blushed every time she 
looked at the martial artist redhead. As far back in her life as she 
could remember, she had always said she hated boys. Then did it mean she 
liked girls? She never thought about it until now. Even her older 
sisters realized this, but never said a word because they knew that 
Akane needed to learn this on her own. At school, she could not help 
looking at the girls and avoiding the boys. Her friends had also grown 
quite pretty and attractive. This put the youngest Tendo daughter in an 
unexpected situation.

Was it that she was falling in love with Ranma? Only as a girl? Akane 
felt confused. They were engaged, after all, arranged by their fathers 
despite their hostile rivalry, but Ranma was barely around to talk to 
since she was out practically every night. The thought of some other 
girl catching Ranma&#39;s attention struck fear into Akane&#39;s heart. She 
dreaded she&#39;d end up losing her. Every night when she was home alone, 
she would do the only thing she could think of. She would masturbate in 
the shower or in bed, thinking of the redhead. Sometimes she wound up 
crying out her name when she reached orgasm. She often sighed, knowing 
it was pointless. It felt good, but it wasn&#39;t the same.

Laying in bed, she thought about other possible *suitors*. They were all 
after Ranma, but still, she thought about them. Ukyou? She thought the 
okonimyaki chef had an excellent figure, was attractive and she often 
admired her unbroken spirit. There were times when she thought she was 
also into girls, but their personalities were not always compatible. 
Ukyou had become a nationwide renown chef, and Akane knew she probably 
did not have the time for a relationship. Kodachi? She laughed at 
herself for even bother considering the Black Rose. The chances of her 
ever liking girls were one to a million. Still, Akane could not help but 
admire some of Kodachi&#39;s traits. She was wealthy, a good cook, an expert 
in gymnastics martial arts, always had enough confidence to shake off 
any competitors, and was not a bad looker herself.

Finally, she blushed thinking about Shampoo. From the moment they met, a 
huge rivalry had sparked off between them. Akane did not care that 
Shampoo wanted Ranma. She was just annoyed at the Amazon&#39;s childish 
behavior and because of it, poor Akane went through so much hardship and 
mishap. However, putting the past behind her, Akane pictured Shampoo in 
her mind, and her blush deepened just as much as picturing Ranma as a 
girl. That gorgeous body. That long beautiful hair. That cute face. Eyes 
like a star. Akane had always thought Shampoo was cute, even used it to 
her own advantage against Ranma, but now......Her heartbeat began to 
quicken by the minute. Even the way Shampoo talked was cute. Akane 
realized how hot her face was becoming and she quickly pulled off her 
shirt, trying to cool off. Her breasts had improved in size. She cupped 
and squeezed them gently, moaning softly in pleasure, until she heard 
herself moaning out Shampoo&#39;s name. Looking down, she finally realized 
the truth. It took two long years, but she knew it was true. She was in 
love.

&quot;Hello? Anyone in here?&quot; Akane entered the Cat Caf&eacute; that late Friday 
evening. The weather was warm, and she was dressed up in a T-shirt and a 
pair of shorts, followed by tennis shoes.

&quot;Aiyaa, Shampoo was about to close caf&eacute;--&quot; The Amazon stepped out from 
the kitchen, still in her waitress uniform and she was drying her hands 
with a towel. She blinked seeing who it was. &quot;Akane? What you doing 
here?&quot;

For what would seem like the first time in her life, Akane blushed like 
a cherry seeing Shampoo. &lt;God, she is gorgeous&gt; &quot;Um, well, you see, I 
uh, I uh, I came to uh, see you....&quot; she stammered, poking her fingers 
together idly, looking down at the floor.

Shampoo blinked a few times. &quot;Akane come to see Shampoo? And you is all 
red. You have fever?&quot; She sprints over and places a hand on her 
forehead. &quot;Aiyaa, you so hot, too.&quot;

Akane&#39;s face steams feeling Shampoo&#39;s hand on her forehead. Glancing up, 
their eyes met. Shampoo was smiling. Akane shut her eyes to block out 
that angelic smile and she shakes her head vigorously. &lt;Akane, focus 
here&gt; &quot;N-no, you&#39;re hot--I mean! I&#39;m not hot. I just stopped by because 
I wanted to um, talk to you.&quot;

Shampoo blinked again, lowering her hand down. She tilted her head, 
looking Akane up and down, examining her closely. &quot;Akane act strange 
tonight. Shampoo no see you for long time.&quot; Then she grinned. &quot;Meaning 
you and Ranma break up, right?&quot; Giggling she jumped over Akane to put up 
the closed sign. &quot;Akane go home. Shampoo close up shop.&quot;

Akane sighed hearing Ranma&#39;s name. &quot;Shampoo, we need some girl talk. Can 
we go to your room?&quot;

Shampoo blinked again, then she eyed Akane suspiciously. &quot;You is lucky 
Great-Grandmother visit China. We is alone.&quot; She took Akane&#39;s hand and 
dragged her to the back. &quot;Make this fast. Shampoo no need pervert girl 
make trouble in caf&eacute;.&quot;

Akane fumed. &quot;Who are you calling a pervert?!&quot; Then she sighed and 
stopped, knowing it was not worth what she came here for. Shampoo 
ignored that, anyway.

Shutting the door, Shampoo turned her back on Akane and began 
undressing. Akane sat on the bed and her face turned a bright crimson 
red seeing her undress, and turned her head away respectfully. Shampoo 
did not notice as she was already naked, folding up her uniform. &quot;What 
Akane want to talk about?&quot;

Akane swallowed hard. They were both girls, after all. Looking back to 
Shampoo, she gets straight to the point. &quot;Shampoo, are you still in love 
with Ranma?&quot;

Shampoo pulled out her sleepwear, then she blinked hearing that 
question. &quot;Why Akane ask this all of sudden?&quot; She turned to meet Akane&#39;s 
eyes, finally noticing how red and fidgety the tomboy was.

Looking down, and in a low voice she answered, &quot;Well, because, 
because....&quot; biting her lower lip she said, &quot;Because, all this time, 
I&#39;ve never been in love with him. I hated boys, but, for a while, I kept 
looking at him as a girl, and, I think I liked him better that 
way......&quot;

Shampoo looked stricken. &quot;Aiyaa, Akane like girls?&quot; She blushed, 
squeezing her sleepwear top tightly in her hands. This was something she 
never knew she&#39;d hear.

Blushing heavily, she nodded, her hands folding in her laps and she 
squirmed nervously in her seat, suddenly feeling hot all over again. 
&quot;It&#39;s true. I&#39;ve known it for a long time, now.&quot; Her voice is soft. Her 
head still bowed down, she felt the bed move, and looking back up, she 
saw Shampoo sitting next to her, still completely nude. Akane could feel 
the thumping of her heart pounding in her chest and she could barely 
move.

Shampoo looked so innocent. &quot;For long time, Ranma always ignore Shampoo 
love for him. Ranma never look at Shampoo. Only here for ramen. Shampoo 
get tired and sick of Ranma. Shampoo no love Ranma no more.&quot; She sighed 
heavily as it was her turn to confess. &quot;Shampoo give up. Ranma no care 
for Shampoo. Ranma big jerk. No worth Shampoo time.&quot;

Akane was startled hearing this. She smiles softly and puts a hand on 
Shampoo&#39;s shoulder, squeezing it gently. &quot;Yeah, he is a jerk, isn&#39;t he? 
He&#39;s always been a jerk. I had feelings for girl-Ranma, but he&#39;s never 
around for me to talk to. And, and.......&quot; she bites her lower lip. &quot;I 
always thought you were kind of cute...&quot;

Shampoo widened her eyes. &quot;Akane think Shampoo cute? Aiyaa.....&quot; She is 
left speechless.

Akane giggled and nodded. She lifted a hand up to caress the Amazon&#39;s 
hair. &quot;Even the way you talk. I still think it&#39;s cute. And beautiful...&quot; 
she whispered.

Now it was Shampoo&#39;s turn to blush as bright as a cherry. &quot;Aiyaa... 
Shampoo think Akane cute, too! Akane grow up pretty! Shampoo think she 
like Akane!&quot;

Locking gazes with her, Akane whispered, &quot;I think, I&#39;m in love with you, 
Shampoo. You&#39;re gorgeous. I want you, more than you could ever know...&quot;

Shampoo licked her lips, tossing her sleepwear on the floor and gently 
pushing Akane onto the bed, a wild and lustful gleam in her cat eyes. 
&quot;Shampoo want Akane, too...&quot; She whispered seductively.

No more words were exchanged as Akane&#39;s clothes were tossed onto the 
floor, and the sounds of kissing, thrashing, panting, and pleasurable 
moans from both girls were heard.

&quot;Oh, God, Shampoo!&quot; Akane&#39;s cry was loud enough to echo throughout the 
caf&eacute;.

&quot;Akane so hot, and tasty.&quot; Shampoo was moaning in pleasure herself.....

Akane opened her eyes as the flashback slowly ended. She noticed Shampoo 
had drift off into slumber land, still in the tomboy&#39;s arms. A soft 
murmur is heard, &quot;Akane, wo ai ni.&quot; Akane blushed and she smiled, 
nuzzling Shampoo&#39;s face, and pulling a blanket from the bed to cover 
them both before she held her close, kissing her forehead. &quot;I love you, 
too, Shampoo.&quot; That was the last thing she said before she fell asleep.

Author&#39;s note: Wow, this was my very first Ranma &frac12; fan fiction. The idea 
kept buzzing around in my head, and once I got started, I just couldn&#39;t 
stop.
