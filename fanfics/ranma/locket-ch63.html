<a href="../ranma/locket-ch62.html">Back to Part 62</a><pre>&quot;Bones&quot; Juri flashed a smile to the intense, dark
haired woman who watched the door at the Locket&quot;Any
trouble&quot;

Bones smiled back, the leather she wore glossy yet
comfortable&quot;Nothing to mention.&quot; She brightened&quot;Oh,
May&#39;s interviewing a candidate for the club.&quot;

&quot;Someone&#39;s interested in getting a job&quot; Utena asked,
her long pink hair flowing in waves down her back. A
bit unusually she was wearing a short skirt, but both
it and her top were colored black edged in pink, as
usual.

Juri felt a flash of relief, but she was wary, too.
&quot;So what do you think of her&quot; the orange haired woman
asked curiously.

&quot;She&#39;s got a good feel around her&quot; Bones shrugged.

Setsuna smiled, gently tugging on her lover Juri&#39;s
arm&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we head inside? That way you can meet
her yourself.&quot;

The four women went inside together, Anthy falling in
beside Utena. &quot;I always like visiting here&quot; the dusky
skinned woman murmured to Utena&quot;it&#39;s such an
interesting place.&quot;

Hitomi bowed cheerfully, her gypsy costume making her
look like a very odd fortune teller. &quot;Good to see you&quot;
she said to Utena and Anthy, then turned to Juri&quot;lots
of costumes tonight, as well as a few new guests.&quot;

&quot;Thanks&quot; Juri smiled, turning her eyes to the crowds
and studying the people intensely. The theme this new
years was dressing as your favorite historical figure,
but people had chosen a broad deffinition of the word.
Everything from cavewomen to astronauts were
represented out there, along with figures clearly the
product of pure imagination.

&quot;I knew I should have come in dressed in my Senshi
fuku&quot; Setsuna chuckled, her dark green dress hugging
her beautiful body.

&quot;You look wonderful to me&quot; Juri answered, earing a
smile from her lover.

&quot;Yo, Juri&quot; Tendo Nabiki weaved her way through the
mob, the bookkeeper and accountant of the Locket
wearing a karate gi for her costume. Behinder two
oddly familiar figures followed. She waved to them&quot;I&#39;d
like you to meet Doctor Ranma Saotome and her wife
Katsumi Tendo.&quot;

The redhead lpooked surprisingly mature, Juri found
herself noting, with her long hair opulled back in a
ponytail The lab coat she wore hugged a body that was
still very athletic, but there was an overall look of
contentment about her. Similarly Katsumi looked like
the model of a happy bride, the brown haired woman
holding on to her lover&#39;s arm happily.

&quot;Nice to meet you&quot; Ranma shook Juri&#39;s hand firmly, but
with the clear impression of great strength carefully
held in check.

&quot;I like your club&quot; Katsumi threw Ranma a impish
look&quot;and I intend to haul her up to the kareoke stage
at least once.&quot;

&quot;Oh no...&quot; Ranma was quick to protest.

&quot;Time slipped&quot; Setsuna noted to Juri quietly&quot;maybe 40
years&quot;

&quot;How did you two...&quot; Utena asked curiously.

&quot;It was shortly after Ranma and Akane broke up for the
last time&quot; Katsumi confided&quot;we found ourselves thrown
together by our father&#39;s promise.&quot; She smiled
fondly&quot;But I was surprised how gentle Ranma was once I
got to kow him, how kind...&quot;

Ranma blushed, the redhead looking deeply embarassed.
&quot;I&#39;m just glad that someone as wonderful as Katsumi
could fall for me&quot; she said.

&quot;With charm like that&quot; a smiling Katsumi put her head
on Ranma&#39;s arm as she said&quot;you shouldn&#39;t be
surprised.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me&quot; Juri bowed slightly&quot;but I need to attend
to some business.&quot;

&quot;Well boss, good luck with the interview&quot; Nabiki
nodded&quot;I think May and the new girl are up in your
office.&quot;

&quot;You know&quot; the black haired young woman in a simple
black dress said as she took a drink of the red and
gold cocktail&quot;I never cease to be impressed by the
sheer variety of drinks that you know how to prepare,
Ryouko.&quot;

&quot;Thank you Kanako&quot; the blue haired woman with crestent
shaped scars on her cheeks grinned&quot;but it&#39;s Minagi.&quot;

&quot;Sorry&quot; Kanako Urashima bowed slightly, her face
grave.

&quot;She does that intentionally&quot; the little black cat on
the bar remarked, batting playfully at the fingers
that several bar patrons were offering it.

&quot;Hush, Kuro&quot; Kanako scolded good naturedly.

&quot;Kanako-san&quot; Anthy waved with a smile. She turned to
Utena&quot;I&#39;d like you to meet Kanako Urashima, she&#39;s the
landlord of the Inn I&#39;ve been living in.&quot;

&quot;Tenjou Utena-san&quot; Kanako looked at her thoughtfully
then smiled slightly. &quot;I&#39;ve heard many good things
about you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you&quot; Utena bowed&quot;Anthy speaks often of life at
the Hinata Inn.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll miss her now that she&#39;s planning on leaving&quot;
Kanako noted. She looked impish&quot;I take it you and
Anthy are moving in together&quot;

Utena blushed. &quot;Well, yes&quot; she admitted.

Kanako looked thoughtful. &quot;We are building a new
residence where the old annex used to be&quot; she quietly
revealed&quot;with suites that are suited to more than one
resident. Do you think you might be interested in one&quot;

Anthy looked hopefully up at Utena as she pointed
out&quot;We hadn&#39;t settled on where we were going to move
to.&quot;

Utena frowned slightlly as she asked&quot;The residents
aren&#39;t going to have issues with two women living
together there&quot;

&quot;They know Anthy fairly well by now&quot; Kanako said
simply&quot;I think they would merely be happy for her.&quot;
She paused then smiled&quot;And from what I gather most of
the residents think your courting is quite romantic.&quot;

Utena looked at Anthy&quot;They know about us&quot;

Antrhy looked mildly sheepish as she admitted&quot;I did
sort of ask around for some advice shortly after we
were first reunited.&quot;

&quot;I believe Kitsune had a betting pool on for how long
it would take for Anthy to land you&quot; a deadpan Kanako
revealed to Utena.

Utena had to smile, shaking her head as she did so.
&quot;All right&quot; she finally said&quot;we&#39;ll try one of your
suites, then.&quot;

Kanako smiled just slightly&quot;I look forward to getting
to know you better.&quot;

Juri left Sestuna at the bar to order them their usual
drinks as she headed upstairs, walking down the hall
to her office. She nodded to Excel and Hyatt emerging
from one of the bedrooms upstairs, trying not to laugh
as they tried to straighten out clothes after a
quickie.

&quot;Miss Juri&quot; May looked up with a smile from where the
busty brown haired woman sat, a green haired young
woman sitting nearby.

&quot;Ma&#39;am&quot; Alpha rose to bow, her smile gently. She
looked tired but still energetic, her eyes welcoming
the world around her.

&quot;My name is Arisugawa Juri&quot; she offered the other
woman her hand as she continued&quot;it&#39;s nice to meet
you.&quot;

&quot;My name is Alpha&quot; she shook it back&quot;I was looking for
a temporary position.&quot;

Juri had a good feeling about this girl, one clearly
shared by May considering her happy smile. &quot;Do you
have any experience&quot; she asked curiously.

&quot;I run my own cafe&quot; Alpha explained as she added a bit
wryly&quot;though it isn&#39;t as busy as your club is.&quot;

Juri noted that as she asked her&quot;So why are you
looking for a position here rather than running your
cafe&quot;

Alpha looked a bit down&quot;My cafe was badly damaged by a
windstorm, and I need to raise money to try and
rebuild.&quot;

All right, Juri could respect that. &quot;We&#39;ll give you a
try&quot; she said firmly&quot;and if things work out, you&#39;ve
got the job.&quot;
