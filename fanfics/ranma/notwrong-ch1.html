<h1>Nothing Wrong with This Picture</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kanomi.html">Kanomi</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I could feel Ranma tensing up, squirming... And those sounds he
made, so lovely.  I continued with my efforts, driving Ranma on
and on until I felt him stiffen, his body taut, his breath
caught in his throat, but I didn&#39;t slow down I wanted to push
him on still, until his cry of pleasure pierced the room.  Only
then did I let go, dropped my hands off his hips, and I slumped
down into the bed. Ranma was relaxing on top of me, now I could
hear his panting as he tried to regain his breath.

That did not last. He stiffened again and then jumped right out
of the bed with a yelp of fright, going to the farthest wall.  I
blinked at the sight of the blanched Ranma-chan cowering in the
corner, his hands covering breasts and face as if he was trying
to hide from sight before I realized that the strange thing was
that I -could- see him, that there was light to see him with.
The room should have been dark.  I flicked some hair that was
sticking to my brow, and rolled over to look towards the open
door, and sure enough I saw Akane standing, gaping at the sight
of me and Ranma, which I was pretty sure was impressive, both of
us naked, and sweaty from some rather intense sex... And Ranma a
girl to top it all off.

All Akane managed to say was a stumbling &quot;Ka..Ka.. Kasumi?&quot;
before she fled the room, stricken.

*Oops* was all that went through -my- mind for a while. &quot;Oh
my..&quot; I said absently, watching the opened and now vacant door.

--------

Not the most auspicious of beginnings. But then, it wasn&#39;t
really the beginning. It was more of a culmination... a climax,
if I can be excused the pun.

I know I&#39;ll have to face the family, or at least Akane, before
long, and that I had some explaining to do. I needed very badly
to organize my thoughts.

---------

No need to adjust your set, gentle folks, because there&#39;s

                Nothing Wrong with this Picture

--------- It all began when (almost one year earlier): ---------

I watched as Ranma stormed in. &quot;I don&#39;t understand her!&quot; he all
but screamed. &quot;I don&#39;t understand her at all!&quot;

Keeping my cool, I smiled wistfully towards Ranma before taking
on a more empathic expression and coming over to the seething
Saotome.

&quot;She&#39;s really a sweet girl, you know.&quot; I stated softly, with no
more preamble, knowing full well who he was talking about.

&quot;She&#39;s about as sweet as a brick in the face. Which is exactly
what she did to me!&quot; he exclaimed.

I felt sympathy for him, and I leaned a bit closer to the young
man. &quot;What happened with Akane, Ranma-kun?&quot;

&quot;I just don&#39;t understand her, Kasumi... I was trying to
compliment her and then she hit me.  In the face. Many times.
With a brick. I think she simply tore it off a wall.&quot;

I felt my smile twitch oh so barely as control lessened, but
then I asked softly &quot;What did you say exactly, Ranma-kun?&quot;

&quot;Oh well, I just told her she looked less like an enraged
buffalo in that cute dress she had on today.&quot;

I felt that twitch again, &quot;And then...?&quot;

Ranma, who usually has just about as much sensitivity as a blunt
rock, seemed to notice this change in my expression and only now
was coming to realize just what it was he had said. I smiled
sympathetically as he added &quot;And then I said that of course it&#39;d
look even better on me...&quot; He looked at me &quot;Well it&#39;s true!&quot; he
just had to add.

I felt my smile almost completely disappear. Well, almost.

&quot;Ranma-kun...&quot; was all I could hesitantly say before Ranma cut
me off.

&quot;I put my foot in it again, didn&#39;t I?&quot;

I was taken aback slightly by his uncharacteristic admission of
guilt, &quot;Yes, you did.&quot;

&quot;Hum.&quot; went Ranma, uncertainly then added, &quot;I better go
apologize to Akane.&quot; as he stood up.  Before he left he turned
to me &quot;Thanks, Kasumi!&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t do anything, Ranma-kun.&quot;

&quot;Oh yes you did. You made me think.&quot; was his response, then he
flashed me one of his boyish grins that made those girls pursue
him the way they all had, &quot;And I know that&#39;s no small feat.&quot; He
really is handsome. A bit young, certainly not all that mature.
But more than a little handsome, yes.

As he left the common room, I felt maybe he was marching to his
doom.  But then, when didn&#39;t he?  Brave Ranma-kun.

I didn&#39;t know it at the time, but this was to be our first of
many little chats over his difficulties.

-------- It was but a few months later: --------

It was a despondent Ranma who walked into the kitchen, picking
up something and quite unenthusiastically studied it in the most
thorough manner, without really seeing it. He placed it back
where he&#39;d found it and if I were Nabiki, I would be ready to
bet it had been without even realizing that he had no idea that
it was a spoon.  Yes, I do mean that he didn&#39;t even notice he
didn&#39;t know what it was, maybe even didn&#39;t really know he&#39;d
picked it up in the first place.  That&#39;s how out of it he
looked.

I turned to the soup for a moment, tasting it and then reducing
the heat, it would be ready shortly, so that I could turn my
attention back to him. He had none of his usual energy and anger
the way he always was after a fight with Akane.  He looked
utterly miserable, and my heart flew to him.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Ranma-kun?&quot;

&quot;I.. I.. I don&#39;t know, Kasumi-chan.&quot; he answered weakly.

I couldn&#39;t help but blink. This was certainly not the Ranma I
knew.

He seemed to notice my confusion and took a deep breath.  &quot;I had
another fight with Akane.&quot; he said, dejectedly. &quot;But.. I really
tried. I mean, I didn&#39;t say anything wrong this time. I don&#39;t
think so. But she just jumped at one comment I had made about
the food being nice at that restaurant, and started yelling at
me about how her cooking was really improving and I was a jerk
and all that.. I had -not- mentioned her cooking!&quot; he let out
the last louder, throwing his hands up.

&quot;And then?&quot;

&quot;Then, I kept my mouth shut. It&#39;s true her cooking has been
improving, but I was afraid I&#39;d say something wrong, so I just
said how I didn&#39;t mean it that way.  And she took that as an
admission that I was really trying to insult her cooking again
and threw me out. Through the skylight.&quot;

&quot;You really didn&#39;t say anything?&quot; I asked again, in my most
gentle manner.  And a very gentle manner it is, if you know me.
It wouldn&#39;t do to let him think I was taking any sides, now,
would it?

&quot;I think I compared the restaurant&#39;s food to your cooking, but
saying yours was better.&quot; he says, eliciting a short lived smile
from me, brave Ranma-kun. &quot;But then Akane started screaming..
And I -really- tried to think good before I answered, not to say
anything wrong. But I think she took it to mean I was guilty.&quot;

Ranma slumped into a chair and let out a deep, heartfelt sigh.
&quot;It&#39;s not working, Kasumi-chan.&quot; he said at last, still starting
at the center of the table without really looking at it.

So I went and sat down next to him, and put my hand on his
shoulder to try and reassure him.  Ranma put his hand on mine,
which surprised me, and sighed again then said &quot;I&#39;ve really been
trying, Kasumi-chan.. I&#39;ve been trying really hard. I wanted it
to work. And you&#39;ve been helping a whole lot.&quot; he added, smiling
sadly up at her, before continuing &quot;All our talks like this have
helped me a whole lot, I know it. But still.. she gets mad at
me. I think she expects me to insult her and when I don&#39;t, she
thinks I&#39;m being subtle or something.&quot;

I actually laughed at this, though not for long, and then, with
a sheepish grin, I explained &quot;You and Akane are the furthest
thing from subtle people I&#39;ve ever known.&quot;

Over the last few months, taking time out to actually talk with
him, I think we&#39;ve become friends. I&#39;d helped him a lot, was
what he said, by helping him to see that expressing his feelings
was not a bad thing, even for a guy.

He smiled weakly at my comment, and then he spoke, so quietly,
it was almost a whisper, &quot;I want to try. I know she tries too.
But... It&#39;s like something is always happening. We&#39;ve known each
other for a while now.. And she still doesn&#39;t trust me. And I
still don&#39;t trust her, when it counts.&quot;

He sighed and slumped a bit more in his chair, while I patted
his hand. &quot;It&#39;ll get better, you&#39;ll see.&quot; I said, for the
umpteenth time.

-------- It goes bad --------

I remember that over the next few months Ranma and Akane started
growing colder with each other. It wasn&#39;t pretty.  The fights
were growing nastier, and the making up was taking longer to
occur.. if it really happened at all.  It was very frustrating.
Nothing I did or suggested to either of them helped in any ways.
My occasional, and growing sparser, comments that &quot;Everything
will be alright&quot; started sounding really hollow.  Along with
everyone, I went through a period of gloom that was but a pale
shadow of what Ranma and Akane must have been going through.
They say that to love and to lose is better than to not have
loved at all. I wonder if it applies to people who almost, but
not quite, loved.  They were hurting, and I was not really able
to sooth any of it.

I know neither of them were happy to see it end this way. They
had both glanced at one another&#39;s nicer sides and had wanted in.
Even I could see, it would probably never be.

Moving out had lead to a lot of changes. It was like losing
family.  It hurt for a while, but now he was beginning to be
happier, though. Changing schools was helping him, giving him
new things to think about. For some reason he had taken on some
theater courses. Who would have thought something good could
have come out of that Romeo and Juliet disaster?  Sometimes,
he&#39;d recite some lines for me, most of the time exaggerating his
expressions and movements to the point that he would have to
stop and join in as we laughed out loud.

It felt sad, but it also felt good. It was the death of
something that could have been beautiful. And now they both were
starting to move on.

-------- Lonely is as lonely is, but it&#39;s better to be lonely
together --------

For the next while, Ranma took some comfort in our talks, and
I&#39;ll admit, so did I.  Not many people just stopped and -talked-
to me.  For some reason, Ranma was one of those few, even though
he himself wasn&#39;t much of a talker. A man of action, that&#39;s what
Ranma-kun is.  It&#39;s all sort of a blur of pleasant evenings, one
or two hours, sometimes a little walk. Or maybe him asking me
for help on some purchase or other when he needed a feminine
angle.  Or a feminine point of view when he would talk about his
&#39;women problems&#39;... He still had a lot of fianc&#130;es, and now that
Akane was not in the competition (how he hated that part of
it... The loss of control over his own fate it made him feel
like) the other fianc&#130;es were upping the ante, going ever more
furiously, fighting amongst themselves more intently.  And
sometimes, he felt pangs of guilt over the fact that the few
glimpses of Akane he&#39;d catch were of a happy, smiling and
laughing cute girl.. not the constantly angry girl he&#39;d come to
know.  Despite all my protest, he knew she had been that way
because of him.

And he listened to me, too. When I would say I was lonely, he&#39;d
offer a sympathetic ear, he&#39;d come over more often for a bit,
for longer periods of time.  Like when I told him I had stopped
seeing Dr. Tofu.  At first, he was pushing for me to continue
seeing him. But then he saw just how hurt it made me that I
never could speak to him. Not after all these years.  Ranma
understood how a relationship with no communication could only
be bad.

So he got me to start training again.  He wanted me to get my
minds on other things. Oh my. It was so strange, I had not done
any kempo in many years.  And it was the first time in those
many years I walked into the dojo wearing my gi.

But, it all came back to me, and although I was a bit rusty, I
think I impressed Ranma. I was, after all, a black belt of the
Tendo School of Anything Goes Martial Arts.  I was never taken
with the violence side of the Art, but the serenity, the beauty
of it, when it is at its purest...  I had thought Ranma&#39;s style
was unrefined and rather chaotic, which served him well in a
fight, but did little for regarding the Art as a thing of
beauty. Watching him practice with his father had given me that
impression.  But now, while we practiced our kata, I saw another
facet of his Art. I had thought father was incredibly graceful
in his art. Now I found that Ranma had almost reached perfection
in that aspect of it as well. That which all martial artists
hoped for, but could never attain.  He was... fluid and
graceful, his motions seeming all the more natural and yet
inhumanly beautiful. I was entranced the first day I really saw
him lose himself into the motions.  He was poised, then a flurry
of motions, then sliding over the floor, then flying over a mat.
His patterns were intricate as the most incredible dance, an
almost hypnotic series of steps melting into sweeps, hand
gestures of blocks and strikes.  Never an hint of violence in
his motions, just the control and concentration.  When I
realized I was staring at his supple, powerful and athletic
form, I blushed and tried to do my best not to look too
disgraceful in comparison, while performing my own dance.

I also think he was feeling proud. I was his first student, you
see, he&#39;d never trained anyone else. It felt very special.

-------- There&#39;s a silver lining...  --------

It wasn&#39;t until a few months after the Saotomes left the
household that it happened. Ranma had still been visiting often.
The sweet boy knew just how lonely it could get. He had friends.
But I did not. Except him. And I am pretty sure he enjoyed my
company. God I hope he enjoyed it.  But he did come back, and
almost daily too.  Akane and Ranma are over with.  They patched
up some of it not to hate each other, and they don&#39;t fight. But
that&#39;s because they mostly avoid one another.  And are happier
this way.  My little sister now smiles again, most of the time.
For a while there, I had lost hope to see her happy again.  And
the same goes for Ranma.  He had seemed so lost for a while
there.

Somehow, the Saotomes&#39; departure had left a hole in the
household.  The dojo seemed lonelier than ever, more.. boring.
Even with the way Akane and Ranma had conducted themselves
towards each other at the end there, at least, the house had
been full. No more.  Well, on the bright side, it&#39;s much easier
to stretch the budget to meet the needs of two less than these
two. They sure ate a lot. Although it was a pleasure to see them
eat so heartily.

Mr. Saotome, especially, had always complimented my cooking.
When Ranma would come over, sometimes I&#39;d have some tea,
biscuits, cookies or a cake or some other little things for him,
and I&#39;d find that same joy at someone so obviously enjoying my
cooking in such an... extreme manner.

On that one special.. and I believe, fateful day, I only had
milk and some cookies for him. He was not disappointed. He was
never disappointed by anything I did... or didn&#39;t do. Always
delighted by the slightest things, like he wasn&#39;t expecting it
in the least and was surprised.  So, as we had those cookies,
Ranma and me were talking about things. Like how he was fitting
in at his new school.  How things were going with his numerous
(and, at his hurried protests, unwanted) fianc&#130;es.

&quot;Did you know then when you left that you would take all the
craziness away with you?&quot; I asked him, most rhetorically, as he
finished recounting how the latest attempt at an ambush/date by
a desperate Shampoo had gone. &quot;It feels most peaceful, but also.
Well, boring.&quot; I continued, then added, &quot;I don&#39;t believe I am
saying that.&quot;, shaking my head in disbelief at the concept.

Ranma chuckled in his friendly manner, and then said &quot;So you
miss me and my crazy stunts?&quot; he asked, then threw his chest out
in a most overblown macho manner and boasted &quot;No girls can
resist the famous Saotome charm, you know!&quot;

I pretended to swoon at his silly display, and I took on the
most girlish voice I could &quot;Oh.. Oh Ranma-sama! You are such a
man! A man amongst men!&quot; I went on, doing my best to have that
cute girl making really big cute eyes at him as I&#39;d seen -him-
do as a girl when he wanted something.

Ranma picked up his glass of milk and his cookie without
answering. &quot;Ah!&quot; he declaimed so suddenly and loudly that he
startled me, &quot;This glass of milk is so fresh and cool, the very
nature of innocence!&quot; after which oration, he brought the cookie
up high for emphasis, like some heavenly thing to be held above
all things, &quot;but this cookie, it has chocolate and is so sweet
and crunchy.. How can I choose!? I must have them both!&quot; By this
time, I couldn&#39;t hold it in and I had to laugh out loud.  His
impersonation was dead-on.  That&#39;s when he grinned at me and
dunked the cookie in his milk, before eating it.

After a moment of munching, and me calming my laughter, &quot;And
you, fair maiden!&quot; he exclaimed, (this is when I had to grab
unto his arm not to roll over laughing), &quot;Would you partake of
the fount of love that I am!?&quot;, by now he was gesticulating
grandly, exaggeratedly, having put the glass down, &quot;I know, I
know, it is hard to resist me. I am such a paragon of manliness!
A God amongst mere mortals!  Women fall at my feet, like the
cherry blossoms, and twice as sweet.  But I must remain
virtuous!&quot; He shook his fist up.

I cut in &quot;But... Oh Ranma-sama! Please take me! I&#39;d be the best
for you!&quot;

That didn&#39;t faze him, &quot;Ah! But I can&#39;t be for only one! After
all, what would the others do, it&#39;d break their hearts! And I
understand them, too. I&#39;m so handsome, it&#39;s a crime!&quot;

I loved to see him so carefree, after so much bitterness had
gone on. It also felt nice to know he trusted me in ways that
would allow him lower his guard like this without any fear of
ridicule.  &quot;But.. but.. Ranma-sama! I can cook better than all
the others, you know it, and I never hit you!&quot; I replied, almost
bursting out laughing, &quot;And at least, I&#39;m a full grown woman!&quot; I
added, straightening myself, about the same height as him now,
but that last statement made ridiculous by the little girl&#39;s
voice I was using.

&quot;But I cannot choose any one!&quot; he answered me, still
gesticulating emphatically, and in a most silly way, &quot;For you
see, I must remain free as the wind!&quot; he went on, grabbing me
around the shoulder with one arm and pulling me close, while
pointing out to the horizon with the other. Suddenly, my heart
skipped a beat. His voice did not seem so loud anymore, almost
covered by the beating of my heart. I don&#39;t think he noticed,
still taken in our playing.

Nervously, but, to the great Saotome sensitivity, completely
unnoticed, I went on &quot;And, we could finally fulfill the
Saotome/Tendo union.. Ranma-sama.&quot; I said, my heart suddenly not
as much into the play, as I felt his strong arm around me, the
position forcing me to lean against his chest a bit.  It felt so
good, to have him hold me this way.  My heart felt like it might
leap out of my bosom. It&#39;s a wonder he didn&#39;t hear it.

&quot;Okay then, it&#39;s decided! I shall choose you!  Come girl, let me
kiss you!&quot; When he turned towards me to deliver his next speech,
he sputtered to a stop, surprised at how close I was. I don&#39;t
think he had noticed what he had been doing, for once having
just been playing, without a care. But now, I could feel some
kind of tension growing, and I felt... Well, it felt really nice
to have a man&#39;s arm around me this way. And he wasn&#39;t letting
go.

Finally abandoning the squeaky girl I&#39;d been using, I weakly
whispered, &quot;Okay.. I will kiss you.. if you will.&quot;, all this
while, looking up into his gaze, and by that time, locked in
place in shock at what I had just said.

He leaned close. Closer. Oh God, he was going to do it. I didn&#39;t
want him to. I wanted it more than anything else. I was
paralyzed in place, letting him draw closer still, his breath
caressing my lips.

I stopped fighting it suddenly, unbelievably, and I moved too,
towards him, giving him the acknowledgement he had been waiting
for.

It must have been a sight, the way both our eyes bulged,
surprised by what we were doing. But when our lips met, I closed
mine, and relaxed against him. The kiss went on and on, it was a
tad clumsy, from both our sides, but there was a soulful quality
to it, one drowning woman kissing a drowning man. Desperate.
Needful.

Then it was over, and I blinked, as Ranma swiftly scooted away
from me, clearly horrified.

And an instant later, I watched Ranma bounding over the wall of
the Dojo&#39;s yard hurriedly and disappear in the distance. &quot;Well
I&#39;ll be...&quot; was all that made it through the turmoil of my
emotions. I realized I&#39;d unconsciously lifted my fingers to
touch my lips where the tingle of our kiss had finally died off.
&quot;Where did that come from...?&quot; I murmured to myself,
wonderingly. And so, trembling, weak at the knees, for it had
been a -good- kiss and the speed of his departure quite
shocking, I got to my feet and climbed to my room, without
finishing my chores. They could wait for tomorrow.

I didn&#39;t really blame Ranma for his hasty retreat. He was
surprised, and just as shocked as I&#39;d been at what had just
transpired. And if I knew him well, he was blaming himself for
the &#39;horrible way&#39; he&#39;d treated me. Sweet Ranma-kun.

But I had some figuring out to do. About my life. And whether I
wanted this. I knew Ranma would probably try to avoid thinking
about it, himself, or rather, would not think of it in that way,
so I had to think for both of us.

-------- It&#39;s Getting Better all the Time: --------

It was a nervous Ranma who walked into the Tendo courtyard that
next day. He stopped, looked about furtively, as if afraid
someone might see him and guess what he&#39;s done just from looking
at him. Well, I noticed him and smiled his way, reassuringly.
It was my best smile because I -really- felt radiant that day.
Ranma froze in his tracks and seemed taken for a moment, and I
wondered if I&#39;d frightened him. But no, he was still there, and
I the thought hit me, making a blush creep on my cheeks warmly,
that he was admiring me.

&quot;Ka-Kasumi?&quot; he began, hesitantly.

&quot;Come over, Ranma-kun.&quot; I said, still feeling radiant, despite
the heat on my cheeks &quot;We need to talk.&quot; I added as I made my
way to a remote, corner of the yard that was very much out of
view from the porch.  I was pretty sure we would need the
privacy.

Ranma looked a bit nervous, but not as much. You know, sometimes
even I find my powers to sooth people rather incredible. By the
time he was standing next to me, he looked calm and ready to
talk.

As we sat down, I hesitated only a fraction before saying &quot;About
that kiss...&quot;, letting the last word trail. Ranma looked up and
said &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Kasumi, I shouldn&#39;t have...&quot; but he broke off
that line and let it trail as well.

I think he noticed just how I was smiling still, looking so very
happy, and I could see it in his features that it was dawning on
him that maybe I was happy -because- of the kiss. I reached a
fingertip to touch his lips, shushing him and making him blush
at the affectionate intimacy I was displaying, &quot;Shhh.. We both
wanted it. We both did it.&quot; I said ever so softly, feeling my
cheeks reddening even more with a flush that probably matched
Ranma&#39;s, &quot;I.. I was surprised.  But I did enjoy it.  I like you
a whole lot, Ranma-kun.&quot;

I turned away from him, to stare in the distance over the walls
of the dojo where the sun was about to set.  Suddenly, I was
feeling regrets for something that could have but never was, a
wistful moment.  &quot;There&#39;s only one person before yesterday that
I would have kissed and not regretted it.&quot;

To this day, I&#39;m sure that Ranma must have noticed the tear,
that I felt running down on my cheek and wiped before turning
back to him to see him bite his lips as I continued, &quot;But that
was a long time ago now, really. And.. You&#39;re a very important
person to me, Ranma-kun... Ranma. Yesterday, after that kiss, or
rather through that kiss, I realized just how much.&quot; I said,
searching his eyes for the same thing in him that I felt in me.

Ranma was looking very embarrassed again, but I smiled softly,
reassuringly, &quot;Kasumi... Kasumi-chan, I.. I care deeply for you
too.  You&#39;re my closest friend, maybe my only friend. And now,
maybe more than a friend.  You know I ain&#39;t much good with
words.  And with feelings, even if you -have- helped me lots
with that...&quot;

Smiling very brightly anew, I cut in again, as it just won&#39;t do
to have him this way so I said &quot;And you are the only one left to
me too, you know.&quot; He smiled back to me, and yes, it was -that-
smile again, and I felt my heart flutter, understanding certain
girls who had -fought- over him.  Calming myself, I continued,
&quot;Now.. this might not be all that easy.  If we want it to
happen. If we want to be together -that- way.&quot;

I realized I was dancing around the subject somewhat, usually
not a very good idea around the oblivious Ranma, and so I
rephrased more directly &quot;If we want to be.. romantically
involved. And I would like that.  But, there is Akane, and
others maybe.&quot;

Ranma looked very nervous now, doing a little twiddling of his
fingers as he stammered out &quot;W-w-well, I.. I would. I mean,
I&#39;d.. I would like that. I&#39;d like to try. I think Iloveyou.&quot;
Those last three words coming out so fast they seemed to
surprise even him. Certainly, -I- was surprised, and I think I
showed it. but I also didn&#39;t hide my delight as well. &quot;I love
you too, Ranma-kun.&quot; I stated, at first tentatively, then
repeating myself &quot;I love you very much.&quot; as I nodded at my
firmer voice.

And then, as if, unlike yesterday, we had rehearsed it, we
leaned forward with perfect timing, to kiss. It was no
Earth-shaking kiss. It was light and it was sweet and soft, and
when it ended, I found my arms had reflexively wrapped around
Ranma.. and his around me.  Then, we kissed again. And yes, this
one was something else. I think Ranma wasn&#39;t so nervous anymore.
Myself, I felt like I was going to faint. That&#39;s how good it
got.

And, corny as it may sound, the sun set at that moment, and the
light died down around us as the kiss faded out, but still we
held unto each other.

He&#39;d chickened out the night before.  At some point, his nerves
had caught up with him and he&#39;d broken away and fled. Again.  I
understood it in a very intellectual way, but it had felt like a
betrayal at the time.  Now Ranma was back.  He was nervous. It
was obvious, the way his eyes darted to one side and the other.
And I could practically hear him going on about how &quot;That&#39;s not
how men behaved, was it?&quot; &quot;That&#39;s not what all the boys at
school would do...&quot;

Ranma, despite all of my coaching in this, still felt very
insecure about his masculinity. Between the curse and his
shyness around the fairer sex, he didn&#39;t feel all that manly, so
often. And he hadn&#39;t been able to be whatever would be enough
for Akane, he&#39;d told me. And I think he knew he&#39;d hurt me when
he&#39;d fled that way. I&#39;d told him so much about things like that
when he was still trying to make it work between him and Akane.

Well, it was a nervous Ranma who hopped into the dojo&#39;s yard,
looking around to make sure nobody was there. He came to that
remote corner.. Our corner, as I thought of it now... since last
night.

I could see he started breathing more easily as finally saw me
here, behind the shrubs. I was obviously waiting for him.  He
bit his lower-lip and came to sit down next to me, but I hadn&#39;t
looked up at him, and I didn&#39;t make any move to acknowledge his
arrival, until he was sitting.

&quot;Kasumi-chan...?&quot; he started, really quietly. Meekly, even.
Quite a feat, for Ranma Saotome.

I turned to look at him, and I couldn&#39;t summon the strength to
put on one of my trademarked gentle smiles. Instead, I spoke
softly, &quot;It hurt, Ranma-kun.&quot;

He started to speak but I put my finger on his lips. Like that
other time. &quot;Shhh..&quot; I whispered, then leaned close, letting my
forehead rest against his, feeling drained somehow, &quot;And then, I
understood you. You&#39;re not ready for it. And neither am I, to be
truthful. But I want it. I want to be with you.&quot; Little strands
of hair threatening to block my sight. I absently brushed them
aside, to look into his eyes, reading there that he really was
sorry, and yes, he seemed to want it too.  But knowing wasn&#39;t
enough.. I needed to hear it, I needed him to acknowledge it in
his own voice, so I asked &quot;Do you want this too. Truly and
honestly?&quot;

I was heartened to see him nod without needing to stop and think
about it. I smiled brightly at him, and that seemed to unfaze
him at last. &quot;I l-l-love you, Kasumi.&quot; He whispered.  Well, it
lacked a little in the strength department, but then, that
little stutter was cute too, in a way.  And Ranma-kun was no
wimp, just... not too strong with words.  And I couldn&#39;t fault
his sentiments.  It would do. Yes, it would certainly do.  For
you see, I loved him too.

---------

It was but a few weeks later that happened the second most
important event of our relationship. During the intervening
time, we&#39;d been seeing each other more assiduously. Often taking
walks around the park or simply to the market for my shopping,
Ranma helping by carrying the bags in his own unique way.  But,
despite that it was an event that would change the course of our
relationship, it was something that uncharacteristically began
when I was alone.  Maybe the times together with Ranma had made
me more sensitive to it, because I was feeling so very alone
that night.  I remember it well...

-----------

I threw down my broom in desperation and covered my face in my
hands. I felt the tears coming, and come they did. There were
loud sobs, and they too were coming from me. I shouldn&#39;t have
let it get to me this much but... it all felt so -wrong-!
Trembling, cheeks tears streaked, I picked up the broom and
continued to sweep off the.. the -things- on the floor. I&#39;d be
here for hours yet. The kitchen was a mess.  Akane was on a
cooking-war-spree. For 5 days she&#39;d been doing this by this
time. But the wrongness wasn&#39;t really all this added work I had
to deal with. It was how Akane hadn&#39;t even tried to begin
cleaning off her own mess this time, and had left with not so
much as a sorry or thank you. It felt so ... pointless. It was
all so unfair!  And so was my whole life.  Pointless and unfair.

I was angry at her, even though, in some intellectual way, I
knew she had just been extremely depressed over the way her
efforts were not leading to anything. Still it was -I- who was
left with the messes to clean up.  I knew it shouldn&#39;t have made
me feel this way, but.. for years it had been leading up to
this. There&#39;s only so much I can take. I&#39;m only human. I needed
out. I needed to flee this place before I went crazy. All I ever
did anymore was the house chores. Nobody else was interested in
even helping.  Except Akane trying to cook for us. For all the
good it lead to every times. She made abominations that she said
was food.

I shuddered. I must not think badly of my sister. She&#39;s a sweet
girl. Just a disaster in the kitchen.

No. No snipes about her. Starting the day after I would start
trying to help her again with her cooking.  There, that
satisfied one thing.

But for that night. I stared helplessly at the mess and then
returned to work.

------

It was late. I&#39;d finished the cleaning very late. I was not
performing up to my own (admittedly high) standards and had
spilled one of the garbage bags back down and had to clean up
the mess a second time.

I was sitting on the edge of my bed, my gaze pointedly ignoring
my own reflection in the dresser&#39;s mirror. I felt like an old
woman. I felt like nothing would ever go my way.  Nineteen and
still stuck at home.  Never getting a boyfriend. Never -living-.
Getting up, I stood in front of the mirror and this time
detailed myself into it.

Well, maybe...

------ Dream weaver, I believe you can get me through the night
------

Some times later it was a slightly less depressed Kasumi who was
staring at herself again in the mirror. I was a very much
transformed woman.  I had changed out of my usual, so demure and
classical attire, now strewn carelessly around the room, and was
sporting a very sexy evening dress of gold lame that hung off my
body loosely, but despite it all was so very revealing in the
way it dangled from my shoulders, hips.. and *blush* yes, my
breasts... It was so light. I think I could&#39;ve crumpled it all
in a small ball in my fist.  It made me feel so much more
feminine, if a bit naughty.  I&#39;d applied some make-up as well,
and had taken out my mother&#39;s jewelry box, which I&#39;d inherited
when she died, to take some simple earrings and a gold bracelet
that now hung from my wrist.

At that point, I was trying to decide which shoes to wear. But
the choice was mostly obvious. I just didn&#39;t know if I could
still wear high-heels... The gold ones would go very well with
the dress.  I couldn&#39;t believe what I was doing. Playing &#39;dress
up&#39; at my age... But it sure was cheering me up.

------

It wasn&#39;t very much later that I tossed a small pebble up to
Ranma&#39;s window at the Saotome residence. And then another.  Yes,
well, Ranma was a very sound sleeper.  Let&#39;s face it, he could
sleep through a hurricane. It&#39;s not a bit a gravel rattling his
window that would wake him up.

Really, it had been a bit stupid to come over this late at
night, what had possessed me?

Startling me out of my thoughts, Ranma&#39;s window opened, and he
poked his head through, looking down.

And stared.  And stared. I started blushing. Then.. I felt..
Flushed, yes, but also.. burning. I needed to do something and
so, I called him down, &quot;Ranma-kun.. please come here.&quot; I, almost
against my will, huskily said.

He looked completely out of it. But he stepped out of the second
floor window and hopped down as easily as if it had been only a
foot or two.. It still amazes me what those youths who are
running around Nerima these days can do.

But at the time, I didn&#39;t even spare one thought to that.
Instead, I fairly slunk my way over to him, as he gazed, like
the hypnotized victim of the snake and I grabbed him with a
ferocity I didn&#39;t know I had and kissed him for all I was worth.
And, I guess that was a lot, because, he passed out.

Sigh What will I ever do with him?

Nothing else for it, so I went to the garden hose and within
second, had a very awake and sputtering wet female Ranma
exclaiming loudly &quot;What&#39;d you do that for?&quot; before realizing the
situation.

-------

It&#39;s not that much later that I was dragging Ranma out on the
street, and where I pushed him into the taxi that was still
waiting for me. I think Ranma was still in shock over my
transformation. And if I&#39;d stop to think about it, I would have
been too. But I was too busy trying to get us out on a -date-
for that to affect me.  First things first. I had no idea where
to go.  I certainly was no specialist on dates, either.  A
little interrogation of the taxi driver revealed what the
hottest club to be in tonight was, and even though I had no idea
if that was true or not, really, any clubs would do.

Ah! Now there was a surprised. Maybe it wasn&#39;t the hottest club
in town, or maybe it was. But the name of the club seemed a bit
suspect for some reason. I didn&#39;t care, though, I could hear the
driving beat of loudly playing music every times the doors
opened, and this is all I needed.  I dragged Ranma inside.  I
was doing a lot of dragging tonight, but, really, I knew Ranma
well enough to know he&#39;d never easily agree to anything like
this, even if he wanted to.  It took a few moments more to
cajole Ranma into following me in. This certainly was not his
kind of places.  But then, realistically, it wasn&#39;t my kind of
places either.

Upon entering, the shock of the deep bass hitting behind my
sternum, of multicolored lights flashing and the wash of human
mass rocking to this beat was enough to still me for a moment,
letting Ranma come beside me.  It wasn&#39;t before I was making my
way to the bar that I noticed something. Something that
explained the knowing smirk the taxi driver had had upon saying
that the &quot;Heart of Lesbos&quot; was the place to be for two young
ladies out for the night. You see, there were only women in the
club.  Ranma noticed too, but in his own naive way &quot;Hey, where
do you think all the guys went to? Are they hiding or
something?&quot; he asked me, over the blare of the music. I just
nodded my head. Or something.  I now remembered what story that
Greek word was from.

It made a flush come to my cheeks.

But it didn&#39;t really deter me. Ranma was with me, and while the
techno music was nothing I would have normally listened to,
right now it made me itch to get on the dance floor.  The
ambiance was wild. Who cared that every one else was a woman? I
wasn&#39;t interested in them. I was interested in me. And I was
very much interested in being with Ranma, away from the dojo.

------

Perspiring abundantly, feeling hot and a bit flushed from all
the alcohol I&#39;d had tonight, I was rocking to the hypnotic beat
of some strange song that was weirdly tribal-sounding despite
all the synthesizers and the definitely modern beat, along with
a swaying Ranma, who after hesitating and almost stumbling about
for a while, had demonstrated incredible prowess&#39;s on the dance
floor.  I think he was handling it like some kind of kata, and
was fairly flowing through the motions like he had been born
dancing. It reminded me of a few afternoons spent watching Ranma
practicing and discovering a whole new level to the Art.

In any case, he was beautiful, sometimes twisting in the most
alluring ways, just like the best of the dancers around us,
which he was probably instinctively drawing from.  This, after
all, was the Ranma who could learn incredible feats of marital
arts involving multiple kicks in mid-air within a heartbeat, and
adapt them to suit his needs. Dancing must have been easy, seen
from that perspective.  For some reasons, it struck me that
night, the way it had never registered before, that Ranma,
although he would definitely have been a tomboy, had an
incredible female body.  Myself, I was rocking with abandon,
letting the beat guide me, and from the stares I was getting,
from both the women around, or from Ranma at times, when he too
wasn&#39;t lost in the music, I could feel that I wasn&#39;t doing too
badly... and that we were the envy of many -many- women.

As this particular song ended, Ranma grabbed my wrist and pulled
me off aside, to our table, for a breather, and we had to lean
closely together to be able to hear each other over the music.
I had to brush my hair from my brow, where it was sticking in
perspiration. I hadn&#39;t tied it, I had wanted it free. Like me.

I took a deep breath and over the din, I screamed &quot;So, what do
you think, Ranma-kun?&quot;

I barely made out the reply &quot;I didn&#39;t think I would, but I like
this!&quot; was his answer.  Then added &quot;What&#39;s with all the girls?
They keep eyeing me all weird. And where are all the boys?  And
didja notice that couple next to us, those girls were dancing so
close together. I tell you, it&#39;s weird.&quot;

I answered &quot;I think it&#39;s ladies night!&quot; Yes. Ladies -only-
night. Every nights.

&quot;AH! I bet they&#39;re all just too cheap to pay to get in, is that
it?  Well, lucky I was a girl then, -we- didn&#39;t need to pay!&quot;

Brave, brave... So cute, Ranma-kun.

I flashed him a smile and he answered with one of his own,
before drinking from his beer.  I had a glass of wine, myself,
and I sipped from it. I&#39;d had more alcohol tonight than in the
last year. I felt quite giddy, but incredibly relaxed yet
excited. Relaxed because I wasn&#39;t holding anything inside
anymore. I was fairly running wild, at least by my standards.
And I think so was Ranma.

Strangely enough, I think his being a girl had helped him. Maybe
it was a crutch, but it had helped him get over his insecurities
about dancing and other such things for this night.  Next time,
I&#39;d make sure to bring a male Ranma out on a date.  Next time...
And there would be one, I was sure of it.

Tonight though, I was merely content to run rampant with my
needs, and to get him to have fun and feel good -with me-. I
leaned over and kissed him hotly, feeling him answer with almost
the same need, only a slight reticence keeping him in check, my
guess being that it was over him being a girl at the moment.

Finally, after getting our breather, we headed out to the dance
floor again.

----

It was -much- later that night that Ranma accompanied me back to
the dojo.  As we stood on the porch, I took the opportunity to
try to read him. It was obvious he felt like me. Exhausted, but
exhilarated from this outing.  He leaned close, and, having to
push to his tiptoes in this form in order to do it, he kissed
me. It wasn&#39;t quite the same kind of kiss that we&#39;d been
exchanging all night. Passionate yet brief embraces. No, this
was a loving, tender, deep and lasting kind. The kinds that got
me weak at the knees. Very weak.  After that, we held unto each
other quietly, just enjoying the closeness.

And that&#39;s when I made my decision. &quot;Ranma-kun.. You don&#39;t have
to go. I&#39;d.. I&#39;d -really- enjoy it if you stayed. If you... Came
to my room?&quot; I asked, no, pleaded.

Ranma turned the cutest shade of red. But he didn&#39;t even make a
move to extract himself from my arms. I liked that.  But what
must he think about me.. Where was the reserved young lady who&#39;s
only sport was to dust the high-spots?

She was on vacation.  I firmed my hold on Ranma and looked into
his eyes. &quot;Ranma-kun.. Would you.. &quot;I hesitated, then finished,
&quot;Would you make love to me?&quot;

I didn&#39;t let go. Didn&#39;t want to. Well, I did loosen my grip so
we could open the door as quietly as possible, while I removed
my shoes, and then, without letting go of each others, we made
our ways into the house, to my room.  It was awkward, but we
didn&#39;t care.

------

As I dropped my shoes into my dresser, Ranma was looking around
the room. He&#39;d not been here often. I think he was also
surprised at the disorder that reigned.

I giggled, and answered his unspoken question, &quot;I sort of made a
mess trying to decide what to wear... And I didn&#39;t want to spend
any time cleaning up, I wanted to get to your place as soon as
possible.&quot;

Ranma remained quiet, nodding his head as he surveyed me. Then
he finally asked, &quot;I was wondering.. That dress...?&quot;

I blushed a bit, but after an hesitation, I answered &quot;One that
Nabiki made me buy over a year ago to try and.. impress
Dr.Tofu.&quot; I said that last word with a bit of wistfulness over
that fiasco.

He didn&#39;t say a word.  He continued to look at me, as, feeling
suddenly self-conscious, I started to slip out of the dress. Not
a word was exchanged as I removed the jewelry, which I carefully
placed back into the box.  Then I turned back toward him and
reached behind my back to undo the fastenings of my bra.  Ranma
was still looking at me. Not a stare, but a... Expectant, but
with a slight, unnerved current underlying it.  But also a
calmness of someone who has accepted something.  Accepted his
feelings.  Oh, and definitely admiring me. I liked that. A lot.
That someone could look at me and look at a -woman-.

I felt love well up within myself, as I removed my bra. I bit my
lips, as his gaze ran over my chest, and I felt sympathetic
tingles at his scrutiny.  Now only clothed in my panties, hose
and garter belt, I moved over to the bed, and sat down, lifting
my leg as I undid the garter holding the silken hosier up, and
looked up at Ranma again, asking &quot;Would you help me?&quot;

It was his turn to bite his lips, as he came over, to kneel down
at my feet. Reaching small, deft hands up along my leg, he let
them brush their way up, before slipping them around the band of
the hose, and then rolling it down.

I smiled at him as he put the bundle of silk aside, and offered
him my second leg.  I could feel a slight trepidation in him. I
think I could tell where it was coming from.

As he removed my second stocking, I murmured &quot;I think we should
wash a bit first, before.. getting to bed. We&#39;re so sweaty.&quot;

He latched onto the idea like a drowning man. I had hit it dead
on. He was afraid to do.. -it- as a girl.

Well, that did not matter.  In fact, although I didn&#39;t mind in
the least his female form, he was very pretty, I might admit to
-some preferences for his own, original body.  Flashing him
another smile, I grabbed unto a large towel and peers into the
hallway. All was clear. At this time of night, it wasn&#39;t too
likely that anyone would be awake.  So I started up the hallway,
and up the stairs, with a very quiet Ranma following my steps.
We made it to the bath room without any incidents, and then I
posted a &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door, before I started on
the hot water to fill the tub.  As it filled, I removed the last
of my underwear, my panties, under Ranma&#39;s frozen gaze.  This
elicited a girlish, wicked giggle from me, before I came over,
to start undressing him.  Oh my. Yes, Auntie Saotome was right,
though, Ranma really should be wearing a bra. As a girl, he is
very.. Healthy.  And bouncy.  I wondered how he could endure all
that physical activity in such a state, but I didn&#39;t want to
talk about -that- right now, there were much more.. interesting
physical activities in mind.

Ranma for a moment let himself be manipulated as I pulled off
his shirt and then dropped his pants, but when I started on his
boxers, he got a sudden bout of modesty.  So cute.  I simply
looked up at him and said &quot;You want to take that bath with the
boxers or without?&quot;

He put his hand behind his head and laughed (quietly) nervously,
&quot;Ahahah.. Well, huh.. Maybe.. I.. Mean..&quot;

I stopped him by putting a finger on his lips lightly, and then
I whispered, &quot;If you don&#39;t want to go through with it,
Ranma-kun... If you feel this is too fast... Just say so. I will
understand.&quot; I would have been disappointed not to say
frustrated, but I would have understood.

But he didn&#39;t. What he said, after taking a deep breath, was
&quot;You&#39;re right. I&#39;m being.. Childish.&quot; And with this admission he
simply bent down, removing his boxers, and when he stood up
again, revealing that indeed Ranma as a girl is a natural
redhead. Which was obvious, but still a little.. Interesting to
find out for sure.  I brushed my hand along the outside of
Ranma&#39;s hip, making him stiffen a bit, but then I said, let me
wash your back as I turned away, to fill a bucket of cold water.
When I faced him again, he knelt down, and had a small towel
bashfully resting on his thighs, keeping some modesty.  I
couldn&#39;t help but smile, then asked him to turn around.

The rest of the bath went on without incident. I had decided to
keep it friendly and quiet, but to not push in any sexual ways
so as to relax both of us. Ranma as boy proved somewhat.. as
healthy as his female half. This surprised me, and, I will
admit, delighted me, although I kept to the good girl act,
pretending not to notice, even as the hint of a flush hued my
cheeks.

When we were done and dry, we crept quietly back to my room, and
as I closed the door behind myself, resting against it, feeling
the hammering of my heart in my chest from the excitement, like
some schoolgirl just back from some childish prank, I looked up
to gaze at Ranma, who was dropping his clothes.  With no urgings
from me.

Letting go of the towel I had been using, I stepped closer, and
two naked bodies intertwined in a close embrace, before we
kissed. It was a really good kiss, the kind that makes me weak
at the knees, but also, one that inflamed me. As I pushed myself
against him, Ranma let himself be guided backward to the bed,
but one miscalculated step from my part resulted in us tumbling
on top of it, breaking off our kiss, as we laughed a moment
before our lips sought each others anew, hungrily.  Ranma sort
of crawled backward on the bed until he was mostly on top of it,
lying on his back, while I squirmed atop him, straddling him,
our kisses becoming furious, demanding, our bodies brushing
against one another&#39;s in the most exciting ways.  I could feel
his manhood rising, wakened and proud, brushing against my thigh
and sometimes against my stomach, while I moved against him with
more emphatic motions.

It did not take long before I had my hands caressing his member,
while our lips kept meeting again and again. He was hard and
lengthy in just the right way. Just the right size. Or so I
felt. Not that I had any experience in such things.  It felt
just right. Everything did. I had wanted to feel like a woman.
Like I was -alive- that night, and I did. I felt wonderful
beyond description. Ranma was not the love of my life. I wasn&#39;t
his. But we did love each other, and we wanted to be together in
this most intimate of ways. To share this experience, together,
as our first.  I knew I did. And I felt he did to.

Although mostly inexperienced, I believe we were doing it just
right. Maybe feelings have a lot to do with it, but every
caresses of Ranma&#39;s fingers against my body blazed over my skin,
leaving tingling trails that sent shivers up my spine. When he
disengaged from our embrace, startlingly pushing me to my back,
straddling me in his turn, it was so he could lover his face to
my breasts, and kiss them and lick them, in ways that maddened
me even more.  Not to be outdone, I finally managed to gather
the strength to push him back down, but instead of straddling
him again, I bent above him, letting my hair hang and sway,
caressing his stomach, while my hands, cupped around his
youthful, yet solid rod, pumped up and down. I leant down to
kiss his navel teasingly, often stealing glances of the fleshy
pillar I was stroking. Emboldened by the way he reacted to these
touches,, I tossed my head back and forth, letting my long hair
whip across his skin, eliciting moans from my darling Ranma&#39;s
lips as I continued to jerk his rigid pole.

Just as I felt him about to push me back to return to the
offensive, I pressed on, this time going for a disabling blow.
If I may be allowed this pun. See, I lowered my head quickly to
his crotch and gathered the head of his member between my lips,
letting my tongue swirl around it like a great big lollipop.
Only saltier. I may not be experienced, but I&#39;ve read some.. and
listened a whole lot more. I had never tried anything like this,
but I knew a few things that a nice girl probably shouldn&#39;t, and
were supposed to be very pleasurable. And from this gleaned
knowledge, I thought I could try a lot of things. Because, I
wanted this to be very good. Very -good-. I wanted to enjoy it
fully. And I wanted Ranma to do so as well.

And that was but my first taste as Ranma, with a gasp, fell back
under my redoubled assaults, as I explored his cock with my lips
and tongue.  And felt it pulse, and suddenly, my eyes grew wide
as I tasted a saltier, tangier flavor than his member had been.
Taken by surprise, I sputtered and yanked my head back, just in
time to receive a second blast of his semen that hotly struck me
to my cheek, to trickle down thickly. I was taken aback, and
kept stock still, as Ranma tried to sit up, the motion making
the next jet of his seed splatter down unto my bosom.  Only then
did I wake up, and blinked at him.  He was babbling apologies,
and seemed to want to flee. That wouldn&#39;t do!  I almost
panicked.

But it was a weakened Ranma who was trying to push me back, and
I replied with a playful *grrr* and a delighted laugh at the
eruption.  Ranma still seemed mortified. His insecurities
probably kicking in overdrive. So I flashed him a smile and...
Licked all around the corner of my mouth where his seed had been
deposited. That got him to stop stuttering his apologies and
stare. When I leaned up, my breasts fairly rolled against his
chest as I snatched a kiss from his lips, then whispered, &quot;Ooh,
you don&#39;t get off that easy, Ranma-kun.  What about me, now?
Let&#39;s get you ready again.&quot; I think the husky way I said that
was what it took to give him back some confidence. Well, and
despite my misgiving.. He rose to the challenge swiftly. So I
resumed my activities, now spiced with that flavor of his
essence.

So that, instead of trying to push me off again, he now caressed
my hair, his fingers brushing through them in a delicious manner
as I tasted him thoroughly.  Soon though, he made me understand
again that he wanted the freedom to return as well as he got,
and this time I let go of him. Not nice to get all the fun. And
fun I was having. It had been incredible to feel how he reacted,
bodily, to every little strokes of my tongues, to the way my
teeth had oh so barely scraped the tender skin of his member
once. Every little twitches had been so exciting.

But now it was his turn, and it was obvious he intended to make
sure we were even.  He first turned his attentions to my
breasts. I could feel the caress of his breath tickling my
flesh, and his lips brushing over the skin, his tongue sometimes
lashing out to swish up, flicking across my nipples, making me
shudder.  That&#39;s when he curled his lips around one of those
raised peaks, and suckled on it. By this time, I was breathing
noisily and quickly, squirming, because his hand had been
caressing along my thighs, and now, it was moving up between
them, teasing its way up to the apex of them, making me gasp and
arch myself, in a reflex of both surprise and of offering myself
to his caresses. Spreading my legs, I felt the touches of his
fingers over the tender, now overly moistened lips of my sex
while his mouth leap from the breast he&#39;d been lavishing with
attentions to the other, claiming my second, neglected nipple
with his lips and teeth, making me cry out as my whole body
jerked at the sudden, electrifying pinch of the stiffened knot
of nerves it had become.

Through the haze of this blazing spark of pleasure, I made out
that Ranma was asking me if I was alright. I think the way I had
thrown my legs straight out so suddenly had surprised him. It
surprised me too. It was all so -intense-!  I had masturbated,
of course, but this was on another level entirely. Just like I&#39;d
always dreamed, and yet completely different.  Breathing
shallowly, I propped myself up on my elbows, and I nodded my
head, &quot;Oh yessss..&quot; I hissed, &quot;Don&#39;t stop!&quot; I pleaded then, and
let my head hang back, mouth gaping on loud, unashamed moans as
he returned to his nibbling of the raised, rosy nipple, and
brought his fingers against me more fully, caressing my sex,
opening the lips with the tentative, loving strokes.  I was
moving my hips reflexively, knowing an abandon totally new to
me. Wanting to reach it. To peak and climax. Needing it. And
still, Ranma was going so slow, so hesitantly, that I had to
tell him, to beg him for &quot;More!  Please, Ranma-kun..&quot; I gasped,
&quot;Give me more.. Faster!&quot;

I felt him shift himself, then kissing down my stomach, while
his fingers moved faster, in more intent, more lively caresses
that were soon accompanied by his breath and finally, his
tongue. This made me cry out, clasping my thighs around his face
a moment before I let go, but by now, I had fallen backward, and
had my fingers twined into his hair, groping, trying to urge him
closer. A wish to which he complied eagerly, now that he had had
his first taste.  I must have squirmed delightfully, because
Ranma lifted his muzzle from between my thighs and whispered, &quot;I
love you Kasumi, I also love the way you move when I do.. this.&quot;
before dipping his nose back down, and sliding his tongue
against me so.. just so wonderfully!  Writhing in time to the
strokes of his tongue, I never noticed him withdrawing slightly,
only to flick his tongue across my clitoris. But that I felt.

I stiffened all over, feeling it.. feeling -IT- coming, and
pushing my hips up, fingers digging into his scalp, I cried out,
my body arched, and the center of my being for a moment
radiating from my sex, from the place where Ranma&#39;s lips joined
to my own, more tender, more sensitive set.  After a while, a
sensation of sated satisfaction filled me, and I mostly slumped
down to the bed, my hands&#39; grips loosening on Ranma&#39;s head.
Another moment, of savoring the aftershock of my orgasm, was
followed by me struggling to slip from Ranma, who had
straightened. I caught his oh so handsome face in my hands and I
kissed him deeply, startled for but an instant when I tasted my
own flavor on his lips, but tossing that aside as I pushed
myself against him, feeling my nipples, the hard and sensitive
little knots, dragging against his chest. Soon, I had him on his
back, my thighs squeezing around his hips, as I felt his manhood
rubbing between them, against my needful wetness. Yes, I wanted
more. And I wanted Ranma.

&quot;Ranma?&quot; I asked huskily, my voice caught in my throat, my
breath still short, &quot;That was.. Wonderful. Thank you.&quot;

Ranma seemed quite pleased at learning this. Some feelings of
anxiety over his abilities gone, I&#39;m sure. He whispered back &quot;It
was so incredible. To feel you go so.. crazy. And knowing it was
because of me.&quot;

I laughed, a happy little thing. Not directed at him, just
something of an enjoyment, and then I kissed him again before I
asked, giving a wider, more lengthy roll of my hips so his cock
slides against my thoroughly wet sex emphatically &quot;Are you ready
for.. more, Ranma-kun?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot; was his sole reply, before he kissed me feverishly,
shifting himself a bit.

Eagerness made for hurried repositioning, aiming, with a pause
only at the moment Ranma, poised at my entrance, looked up at
me, for approval. I nodded quickly, then closed my eyes as I
felt him push up, up into me.  It felt strange, it felt
wonderful. Especially know that this time, we were sharing the
moment. Knowing that this was -Ranma- entering me. I guess I
must have gasped out rather loudly because Ranma paused again,
having barely breached his way in, and looked up at me. I felt
this and opened my eyes to look down at him, locking gazes, as I
nodded slightly, and pushed my hips down some, so he would know
I was ready for more. And more he gave more, and then more than
that. Until I felt a sharp pain. He felt me stiffen yet again,
and stilled anew, awaiting my instructions, &quot;It&#39;s.. It&#39;s the
hymen. Just.. Push. But stop after. Okay?&quot; I said, out of
breath.

He nodded again, and pushed up, forcing against the resistance
and into suddenly, and quite easily, driving up to the hilt into
me with a grunt and a cry wrenched from my trembling lips as I
closed my eyes in surprise.  Then, I looked down at him, as he
waited, with a concerned look on his face.  I smiled
encouragingly, and murmured &quot;It.. only hurt a moment. Now, it
feels .. Good. Soooo good.&quot;

With this, he started moving and I stiffened, expecting more
pain, but there was only a slight, which was washed away in the
intense pleasure I was beginning to feel.  I think my fingers
raked over his chest because I remember that afterward, he was
streaked with nail scratches.  At that moment, though, it seemed
of no importance, to either of us, as he started to thrust into
me with more firmness, still controlling himself not to overdo
it.

The next while is quite a blur, it was through a haze of
pleasure that I felt Ranma burying his face to my bosom, kissing
my breasts, as his hands clasped to my hips to guide the motions
of my body, up and down on his rod.  It lasted a while, how long
I could not tell, until I felt him hurrying the pace, at long
last, at the end of his own control. It wasn&#39;t long then, until,
bouncing atop him, I felt his orgasm, the spilling of his seed
inside of me, and the very thought of this event sent me up and
into a devastating climax.

I still can&#39;t believe we didn&#39;t wake anybody that time, because
we both were very vocal in our shared ecstasy, only slumping
together after a while, finally sated. At least... for a while.

----------

I believe we slept for several hours at that time. I know I
slept very well, but I woke up not all that much later, in the
still of night, and found Ranma was asleep as well.  I gazed at
him tenderly, the man whom I had shared something magical with,
already that night. And whom I wanted to share some more
already.  Disengaging myself from his arms, I rolled over and,
lifting the blankets (I didn&#39;t remember pulling blankets over
myself as I fell asleep, so it must have been Ranma, the sweet
thing, who tucked me in), and bending down to kiss at his thigh.
What beautiful, athletic legs he had, finely muscled, yet so
powerful... And of course, his organ, now at repose. Still
scented with my own aroma... I kissed it, and to my pleasure, it
twitched. So, I kissed it some more, before I cupped it in my
mouth, and suckled very softly on it, feeling it grow, until I
couldn&#39;t take it all down without choking.  I don&#39;t think he was
awake yet, but his breathing had gained a certain erratic
quality, that told me he was very close to rousing. He certainly
was aroused, because his cock was hard as steel.

I continued to suck on him bobbing my head a little, to let him
slide between my lips, when I felt his hand pressing against the
back of my head, and I panicked for a moment, as his member
surged in my mouth, threatening to make me gag. But Ranma&#39;s
fingers simply started stroking my hair, and give me the freedom
to resume my up and down bobbing, trusting my hearing as I heard
his breath hastening, shallow, his pleasure already great. I
drew him along, until he stiffened and emptied himself into my
mouth with a stiffened moan.  The taste of his semen was a bit
salty and certainly tangy, but had a definite erotic flavor, the
best spicing being the knowledge that it was the product of
Ranma&#39;s pleasure, the result of my enjoyable oral efforts.. And
not wanting to make a mess either, anyway, I swallowed.

He drew me gently in, effortlessly, and we snuggled in closely.
It felt good, so very good. Even after (or maybe because) these
intense pleasures we&#39;d given one another, snuggling felt oh so
nice... For a while. Then we made love again. If possible, I&#39;d
swear it was better than the first time.

-----------

Another nap. And yet again, I woke up, feeling that need. I sure
hoped I wasn&#39;t turning into some kind of sex-addict. And then
the most wicked idea crossed my mind, forcing me to stifle a
giggle.  I crawled out of the bed, and groggily got to my feet,
and walked out, to find the bathroom. I got a glass of water
from there. Cold water. I then tiptoed back to my room, grinning
with mischief.  I upended the glass on Ranma... To wake him up,
of course! And wake up he did!

&quot;Gah!!! Cold!&quot; he cried out, on sitting up promptly.  He then
blinked at me as I pushed him back and leaned down against him,
feeling the weight of my breasts settling on his own now very
voluptuous chest as I shook my head to toss my hair to one side,
so that I could kiss him, with one lengthy, passionate kiss, the
kind of lively, fiery hot embrace that left us both panting
afterward. I didn&#39;t hear him complaining anymore, so I said
&quot;Warmer now, Ranma-kun?&quot;, and without waiting for any answers, I
kissed him again.

Within moment, he had forgotten any struggles he was making
against doing it with me as a girl, as our breasts rolled
against one another&#39;s, our legs tangling together.  He was much
softer in this form, even his fingers, more delicate, somehow
the skin smoother, and it felt as if soft silken fabrics were
brushing along my back, caressing me, while we moaned in the
double-mouthed embrace of our needful kiss.

After a long time, I let go, and rose to my knees, to straddle
his head. I felt naughtily egoistic for a bit as I mounted his
face, and felt him kiss up between my legs, to start pleasuring
me in the manner he had started earlier. Only this time, I
didn&#39;t resist, riding his tongue, writhing on top of him, until
I came, clenching my thighs around his face whilst I rocked in
the grip of my orgasm.  When the last shreds of my pleasures
where faded, I let go, and dropped down next to him to curl up
against his soft, curvy frame, nuzzling at his breasts for a
moment, before kissing his lips sweetly, &quot;That was so good,
Ranma-kun... &quot; I whispered to him in a tender and probably a bit
(cheerfully) drained voice.

Ranma simply nodded, hazy himself from this experience, and I
kissed him again, tasting myself on his lips, before I went on,
to explain &quot;I wanted to show you.. Show you the only way you&#39;d
know in your guts it was true, that I love you in any forms you
are. And that being a woman doesn&#39;t make you half a man.&quot; I
whispered, cuddling myself against him. Well, he was cuddlier
this way.

I blushed at my thoughts. Oh my.  Am I turning into a lesbian?
Not that I&#39;d mind it, really, well, if it was not exclusively, I
mean. Ranma was so cute this way, too. And he was still Ranma.
Really.

Gently, I pushed my face down, rubbing my cheeks and lips along
his skin, tasting the accumulated salty perspiration of a whole
night of sex, caressing his flesh, feeling him tremble from my
loving licks, suckles and kisses. &quot;You see, you made me come so
good, Ranma-kun.&quot; I whispered throatily, in what I hoped was a
very sexy purr.  I almost giggled at the effect that had on
Ranma, who jerked reflexively. I stopped it immediately, though.
Then it hit me.  Kasumi the sex-kitten. That was so...
ridiculous sounding!  I switched to another thread of thoughts
before I couldn&#39;t contain my laughter or started meowing. It
-really- wouldn&#39;t do to really frighten poor Ranma on his first
experience like that.

&quot;You made me come so often tonight...&quot; I added, feeling his own
pride swell at this. I had better stop before his ego grew to
epic proportions, as I knew it so often did. I bet he was
already concluding in his mind that since he had been able to
pleasure me as a girl, lacking in some ways for the job (I know
he&#39;s a bit of a macho chauvinist at times, but I love him
anyway), he must be really good.

As I licked down his belly, to kiss inside of his thighs, gently
opening them, putting his knees on my shoulders as I buried my
face between his legs, breathing in his quite different scent.
Tonight, I will have tasted him in both of his genders, in both
of his forms. And loved him all the way.  Maybe I like to
experiment a little as well. This was sure different. I
hesitantly ran my tongue against him, feeling him arch himself,
while I tasted him. Yes, different, and tasty.  I more eagerly
plunged on, all but devouring my sweet Ranma, exploring,
discovering what he liked. It&#39;s true what they say, I think, a
girl is better suited to knowing what a girl -needs-. This lead
to one of my better performance of the night. And to Ranma&#39;s
mind-blowing orgasm.  And finally to that little disaster of
Akane walking in on us.

--------- Back to the Present ---------

That was a mess. What a sight for her to walk into. I should
have been more careful.  She was probably just worried about me
since I wasn&#39;t up and preparing breakfast already.

I shook my head, clearing my thoughts some more. It was already
morning, after all. Not that I had noticed.  I shook my head
again, half in disgust at my own behavior in not preparing for
this, and half again before I just needed to clear my mind.
Enough reminiscing, I needed to talk to my little sister, who
must now be feeling betrayed in the most hurtful manner, and
probably talk to my whole family.

---------

End of part 1!

And while waiting for part 2, think about -

Some more sex.

Ranma and Kasumi plan their future together!

Even more sex.

Kasumi announces her relationship with Ranma to her family. Will
Akane be devastated? Will Soun make more wedding plans?  Will
Nabiki sell the information to mentally unbalanced martial
artists?  Will Kuno learn to put his pants on one leg at a time?

Still more sex.

Well, maybe not all that.

----------------

Author&#39;s notes:

Note 1- Kasumi looks too forward, need to set up early in the
chronology how she is starting to weary of things. Subtly, but
not too subtly.

Note 2- oh yeah, all the sections titles are very .. silly and
tentative. Spur of the moment stuff. But then, most of this &#39;fic
is, so....

Note 3- Akane/Ranma breakup is a bit pushed hurriedly through.
Sure, it&#39;s so I can get on with my story, but still... Maybe
look into it.  Same about the parent&#39;s reactions. Also, find
some way not to have them try and push another engagement
through right away.

Oh and yes, I was very influenced by such works as &quot;Kasumi and
Spice and Everything Nice&quot; short series by Anand Rao, &quot;Red Shoe
Kasumi&quot; by Superdude and also &quot;Guilty Secret&quot; by Angus MacSpon.
And last but not least, Richard Lawson&#39;s &quot;Heart of the Home&quot;.
This one was so obvious I forgot to mention it.  I also hope
none of these authors find it insulting to be mentioned as
having contributed to inspire me to write this &#39;fic.

Also, I have only read Ranma 1/2 up to volume 18 (that&#39;s all
that&#39;s been published translated in French).  I am none too
clear about whatever happens after that point in the series.
