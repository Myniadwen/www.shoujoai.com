This story is just a little mind-fluff to help me over the edge of a 
rather lonely Christmas.  Hope all you romantics and hentai out there 
enjoy it.  Happy holidays!

&quot;For this second of your life
Tell me if it&#39;s true
Anywhere beyond
Is all I want of you
Your lips lies a secret
A promise of a kiss
Or something more than this&quot;

	-&quot;More than This&quot;, The Cure

------------------------------------------------

	Kasumi Tendo had outdone herself yet again.  The dinner had been 
absolutely perfect.  Genma and Soun were eagerly polishing off their 
third helping of turkey, and Happosai was tossing the remnants of the 
steamed peas into the air, and catching them in his wrinkled mouth.  
	Ranma hadn&#39;t eaten that much, but did find time for some of the 
pumpkin pie Kasumi had made (from scratch, of course).  Akane let out a 
long yawn.  &quot;It was great, Kasumi.&quot;
	&quot;Good food always makes people tired.&quot; Her elder sister laughed.  
I consider it a compliment.
	Akane sighed.  &quot;Ugh.  Yeah.  I&#39;m going to go lay down for a bit.&quot; 
She stood from the table.  
	Her father nodded.  &quot;Have a good nap, honey.&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m not going to sleep.&quot; Akane smiled.  &quot;If I do, I&#39;ll be up all 
night.&quot; She turned to Ranma, only to see him eyeing his pie.  He looked 
like shit.  She turned away and kept going, though.  
	Ranma turned slightly to watch her leave, but snapped right back 
to his focusing on his food.  
	&quot;What&#39;s with Ranma?&quot; Kasumi whispered to Nabiki.  
	Nabiki sighed.  &quot;I guess Akane didn&#39;t tell you about the 
mistletoe incident, did she?&quot;
	&quot;No.&quot; Kasumi&#39;s eyes widened.  
	&quot;I&#39;ll tell you later.&quot; Her sister smiled.  &quot;Saw the whole thing.&quot;


	It had been earlier on in the day.  Kasumi had spent all last 
night decorating the dojo for the holidays, and when Ranma woke for a 
quick workout, he was greeted to the sight of evergreen and lights 
strung everywhere.  &quot;Wow, it&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve been in a home 
for Christmas.&quot; He mused to himself.  &quot;I could get used to this.&quot; He 
smiled.
	Nobody was usually awake at this hour, so he decided to forgo the 
getting changed part, and decided to practice a few moves just in his 
night shirt and shorts.  
	He walked over to the training area.only to see the floor was 
covered with pieces of a artificial Christmas tree.  He sighed.  Kasumi 
must have not gotten to that part yet.  &quot;Now where am I going to 
practice?&quot; he asked himself.  &quot;If I run around inside the house, I&#39;ll 
wake everyone up.&quot;
	Ranma thought for a second.  OR, he could TRY not to wake anyone 
up.  Yeah!  A true challenge!  Ninja style!  Sneak attack.  Death from 
above.  He hadn&#39;t tried that in a while.  
	No sooner had he decided on his course of action, then he took 
off down the hallway in a sprint, trying to avoid all the squeaky parts 
on the floor at high speeds.  Ah yes.the perfect morning workout.  

	Akane never liked to admit it, but she loved Christmas.  It was 
still a few days away now, but her internal clock was already geared to 
early morning wake-ups.  
	Certain there was nobody up yet, she walked down the stairs 
dressed in her pajamas with a big yawn.  She hadn&#39;t heard Ranma 
practicing in the dojo, so she figured he must have slept in for once.  

	As Ranma sprinted around the corner, he knew it was going to be 
too late.  Akane had JUST stepped out into the hallway, heading for the 
kitchen, and too sleepy to notice.  &quot;Eeeep!&quot;
	She turned just in time to see him collide into her.  Sacrificing 
his bare knees, Ranma grabbed Akane in a rough embrace and they skidded 
to a stop across the hall with a rough thump.  
	Their eyes opened with their heads on each other&#39;s shoulder.  
Arms wrapped around the other&#39;s back like they had been doing so all 
their lives.  Akane swallowed hard as she felt his heart beating 
faster.  &quot;What he HELL are you doing?!?&quot; she whispered, pushing him 
away like a magnet would push the same pole.  
	Ranma sighed.  &quot;Sorry.  I didn&#39;t think anyone was up yet.&quot;
	She turned up her nose.  &quot;Think you&#39;re the only one who lives in 
this.&quot; her breath caught in her throat, and a deep red blush crept up 
her neck.  
	He looked above her to see what she was looking at.  Directly 
above the two hung a small cluster of mistletoe.  Deciding to lighten 
the tension, Ranma smiled.  &quot;Figures we&#39;d collide like that under 
mistletoe.&quot;
	Akane&#39;s eyes shifted slightly to a point on the floor.  
	&quot;Guess that&#39;s our version of a kiss.&quot; He continued.
	The tension didn&#39;t lift.  Silence echoed between the two.  
Finally, Akane returned to what she was used to.  Attack posture.  
&quot;Speak for yourself.&quot; She said with a sudden air of smugness.  &quot;I 
happen to be an excellent kisser.&quot;
	Ranma wasn&#39;t smart enough to prevent the entrapment.  &quot;Ha!  You 
couldn&#39;t kiss your way out of a paper bag.&quot; He said.  &quot;Besides, I 
thought you tomboys hated all that mushy stuff.&quot;

	Challenge issued.

	Akane&#39;s eyebrows narrowed into a light `V&#39;.  &quot;You should talk.  
You&#39;re not even a man half the time.&quot;

	Challenge acknowledged.
	
	Both stood to their full height to try and intimidate their 
opponent.  &quot;Oh yeah?&quot; Ranma replied, his anger more than evident in his 
voice.  &quot;You&#39;ll never know.  Anyone who would even try to kiss you 
would end up getting a mallet on the head for their trouble!&quot;
	
	Challenge accepted.

	&quot;Ooooh NO!&quot; Akane growled, not even too sure of what she was 
saying.  &quot;You&#39;re not backing out this time.&quot;
	&quot;What??&quot; Ranma blinked.
	She poked his chest with her finger.  &quot;Last time you couldn&#39;t do 
it.I doubt you&#39;ve even kissed a girl before.&quot; She grinned with a wicked 
smile.  &quot;Unless of course you tried kissing a mirror.&quot;
	That really stung.  Partly because it was true.  A truth and an 
insult in one sentence.  That was Akane for you.  Last time, he never 
did kiss her.  They had been in the dojo, and it was to end a similar 
argument.  He found a way to weasel out of it, though.  Soun and the 
old man had been hanging around, and he simply blamed them for spying.  
	Now, there was no one up but them.  He wouldn&#39;t be able to get 
out of this one.but of course, he was too busy waging battle with Akane 
to realize he was about to be trapped.  
	&quot;Oh yeah?  Bet you wouldn&#39;t dare without your dad to save you.&quot; 
Ranma managed.
	The feeble attempt at an insult did not go unnoticed and Akane.  
&quot;Why not?  We&#39;re under mistletoe.it&#39;s not like it means anything.&quot;  For 
some reason, deep within his mind, Ranma was hurt more by that last 
statement than anything else she had said.  Akane seemed a little more 
uncertain after that as well.  &quot;Time to put your money where your mouth 
is, Ranma.&quot; She said, voice still just higher than a whisper.  
	&quot;Okay.&quot; Ranma replied coldly, placing his hands on her shoulders.  
&quot;Fine.  Let&#39;s get this over with.&quot;
	Her eyes closed as she waited stubbornly for him to make the 
first move.  
	Ranma took a deep breath, and he almost lunged toward her lips.  
But at the last moment.time froze.

	Well, it didn&#39;t exactly freeze.  Ranma was aware of his own heart 
beating.the feel of Akane&#39;s strong, toned shoulders in his hands, 
tensing up as he got closer.  But what really hit him was the soft, hot 
wall of air between their mouths.  
	It was agonizingly sweet as her breath entered in the crack of 
his lips and rolled around on his tongue.  The heat left briefly when 
she inhaled, but returned a few heartbeats later, and stronger than 
before.  His eyes opened slightly.  
	&quot;She is sooooo un-cute!&quot;  His mind blared.
	&quot;Of course, you idiot!!&quot; his heart replied smugly.  &quot;She&#39;s an 
angel.  Not JUST cute.&quot;
	He finally let out a breath that he wasn&#39;t even aware he had been 
holding.  Akane&#39;s mouth opened slightly when she felt the warmth.  Her 
eyes were closed lightly.  Lips still parted, slightly moist.  At that 
moment, Ranma had never seen anything more inviting.  
	
	Time resumed, and Ranma moved in, letting the heat wash through 
him.  His arms edged her closer ever so slightly.  Electricity seemed 
to be bouncing between them.  Oh god, this was it.

	At the last possible nanosecond, Akane&#39;s eyes opened wide.  Ranma 
stopped his advance instinctively.  Something was wrong.  Her eyes.he 
saw something in her eyes.  It was something he had never.EVER.seen 
before in her eyes.  He had no idea what to call it.but it was warm.  
Instinctual.  Fire.  
	Just as quickly, though.it turned into anger.  Akane&#39;s face lit 
up bright red and her jaw dropped.  Not in anticipation of a kiss.more 
like shock.

	That was when he realized he was against her stomach.  Not with 
his hands.  Not with his arms.  The entire front of his shorts and 
shirt had tented out to meet her half way, and was pressing up against 
her warm, soft belly.  
	&quot;Oh.&quot;
	Before Ranma could utter another syllable, he was embedded in the 
wall with a giant, throbbing red hand-print on the side of his face.  
Akane stood, still in shock, with her hand outstretched from the slap.  
	&quot;Oh my GOD!&quot; she gasped.  &quot;Hentai!&quot; she says, already half way up 
to her room.
	Ranma struggles for something to say, but can barely breathe as 
the pain replaces the rapidly cooling heat.  &quot;Uuuuuhh.&quot; He gasps 
finally, erection all but gone.  
	His heart takes pity on him (knowing full well it was partly 
responsible) and decides to stay quiet for a good long time.  


	Kasumi was blushing, trying not to look over at Ranma.  &quot;Oh my.&quot;
	Nabiki nodded.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure poor Ranma knows how to deal with 
something like that.&quot; She shuddered.  &quot;From what I heard from one of my 
friends, getting.uh.caught.like that is ten times worse for a guy than 
if a woman&#39;s nipping out and rides the `crimson wave&#39; in public.&quot;
	&quot;It can&#39;t be that bad.&quot; Kasumi shrugged.
	Nabiki just nodded.  They both eyes Ranma with the corner of 
their eyes.  He was rolling around peas on his plate.  &quot;Poor guy.&quot;

	Akane stared at the ceiling for a long time before sleep finally 
took over.  Warm.  Long.  Hard.STOP right there.she demanded.  &quot;Do NOT 
go there, Akane.&quot; she whispered to herself.  &quot;Oh please don&#39;t go 
there.&quot; she moaned.  &quot;Just sleep.&quot;
	It had taken all her will power.every barrier she had built 
up.and a whole lot of unwanted common sense to push him away.  She 
blushed.  &quot;Pushed away&quot; was hardly the case.  She had leveled him 
against the wall.  
	&quot;Ranma.why couldn&#39;t you have just kissed me?&quot; she whispered to 
herself.  He was downstairs right now, not even touching his food, 
probably thinking he was the most horrible person on earth.  At least 
the most embarrassed.
	Akane suddenly felt VERY bad.  Old habits die hard.  Attack 
first, love later.  
	And so close to Christmas?  The one time she felt the most alone?  
Slamming him into the wall was beginning to seem like a more and more 
stupid idea.  


	Ranma walked up the stairs, too weak to care much where he was 
going.  Despite the rumors that were being past around by Kasumi and 
Nabiki, he did not feel humiliated.  
	He would have done a lot just to relive that one moment.even if 
it included the painful conclusion.
	His mind was doing a good job on it&#39;s own.  Ranma Saotome was 
lost in a kiss that never happened.  A kiss that almost happened.  A 
kiss that could have been.would have been.NEEDED to have been the start 
of something.  Anything.  
	A kiss that was now lost.  Forever.  Gone.  Moot.
	A kiss that would never have the opportunity to happen again.  A 
kiss that he fucked up because he wasn&#39;t prepared for just how utterly 
perfect it felt to have Akane Tendo in his arms with her breath on his 
lips.  
	A bit too perfect, he sighed.  They hadn&#39;t even kissed, yet he 
was lost to her. 

	Sweet torture.  

	Her long, white neck.  Soft, pink lips.  Intelligent, strong 
eyes.  Gentle, arousing curves beneath silk-smooth skin.  Passion 
personified.  

	All lost to him because he never expected it would all hit him at 
the same time that morning.  

	Morning?

	Ranma&#39;s eyes widened with new hope.  That&#39;s it!  


	Akane woke to the soft tapping on her bedroom door.  &quot;Hello?&quot;
	It was Ranma.  &quot;Akane, can I come in for a second?&quot; he asked 
softly.  
	&quot;I don&#39;t know if I should let you in any place that has a bed.&quot; 
She replied coldly.  Silently, however, she chastised herself.  For 
fuck&#39;s sake, Akane, he&#39;s trying to apologize.  Grow up!
	&quot;Please, Akane.  It&#39;s important.&quot; Ranma said, the knob already 
turning slightly.
	She sat up on her bed, making sure her hair wasn&#39;t mussed up from 
her snooze.  &quot;Fine.just a second.&quot;
	Reaching over, she turned on her reading lamp and opened a book 
to at least make it look like she had been keeping busy.  &quot;Come in.&quot; 
she sighed with mock annoyance.  
	His head popped in.  &quot;Hey.&quot;
	She tried to focus on the book, but failed.  &quot;Hey.&quot;
	Ranma closed the door behind him and raised an eyebrow.  &quot;I 
didn&#39;t know you were so adept at upside-down reading.&quot;
	Akane quickly turned the book around in her hands.  
	He smiled.  &quot;Gottcha.&quot;  
	She looked down at the book.  It was NOW upside down.  A blush 
was creeping up from her stomach rather quickly.  &quot;If you have 
something constructive to say, you better do it now.&quot; She said quickly.
	He nodded and sat down at her desk.  A good, safe distance from 
her.  &quot;I wanted to apologize for this morning.&quot;
	&quot;Go on.&quot; she said softly with understanding instead of annoyance.
	He took a deep breath.  &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have been running around 
like that for one thing.  I&#39;m sure a mid-air collision is the last 
thing you wanted to wake up to.&quot;
	She smiled softly.  &quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot;
	&quot;And.&quot;
	Here it is, she thought.
	Ranma took a deep breath.  &quot;I wanted to especially apologize for. 
embarrassing you like that.&quot; He said quietly. 
	She had a light smile on her face despite the awkward situation.  
&quot;It&#39;s o.&quot;
	&quot;In the morning.&quot; he continued quickly &quot;us guys 
sometimes.well.wake up like that.&quot;
	Akane blinked.
	&quot;For the first few minutes out of bed, it kinda happens off and 
on.&quot; Ranma explained.  His face was red, despite his clinical 
reasoning.  &quot;I should have remembered it before.well.you know.&quot;
	The anger returned.  `It kinda happens&#39; he said?  &quot;Oh, I see.&quot; 
She frowned slightly.  &quot;So you mean it could have happened with 
anyone.&quot;
	He nodded too soon to notice the tone of her voice.  &quot;Exactly.&quot;
	&quot;Oh.  Well.  Apology accepted.  It meant nothing, I suppose 
then.&quot; She nodded.  &quot;Get.  The.  FUCK.  Out.&quot;
	The way she had said those words made Ranma want to curl up and 
die right there.  &quot;W-what??&quot;
	She was pointing to the door.  &quot;Get the FUCK out, hentai!&quot; she 
fumed, not really caring what she said, but needing him gone before he 
had a chance to see her cry.
	Ranma stood.  &quot;Wait a second!&quot;
	&quot;OUT!&quot; Akane screamed.  
	&quot;I come here to apologize.&quot; he growled, taking the offensive once 
more &quot;.and I bear my humiliation to you.and all you can do is tell me 
to get the fuck out of your sight?!?&quot;
	&quot;I couldn&#39;t care LESS!&quot; Akane growled back.  &quot;Get OUT of my room, 
you pervert!&quot; she said, standing.  Forcing him to the door with her 
presence.  
	Akane herded Ranma to the door with looks that could have killed 
any lesser mortal.  His hand twisted the knob about half way when it 
happened. 

	A tiny voice in his head spoke up.  It was the same voice that 
had gotten him into trouble that morning, but it was not unwelcome.  It 
stated in clear, perfect English (or Japanese if you are watching the 
Sub-Titled version) that if he wanted to save any chance at a repeat of 
that kiss, he would have to act now.
	NOW.

	The knob stopped turning.   
	
	He turned to face Akane, who was still shooting daggers at him 
with her eyes.  &quot;Akane.&quot;
	&quot;Get out.&quot; She repeated, shaking with anger.  Anger she had no 
idea where was coming from.  Anger that felt like a poison to what she 
wanted to feel.  Anger that was too familiar to give up now.  She 
needed the comfy buzzing hatred.  It was the only thing that kept her 
thoughts focused.  &quot;Just get out.&quot;  
	Ranma&#39;s eyes caught hers, and once again, time froze.  &quot;I love 
you, Akane.&quot; He whispered softly.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

	Akane watched the door close behind him with a blank expression 
on her face.  


	It had been three hours now.  Ranma gazed over to the clock and 
sighed.  One A.M..  The little voice in his head was sighing.  &quot;Well, 
at least you admit it when it counts.&quot; His heart said to him.
	&quot;Shut up.&quot; Ranma mumbled back.  &quot;A lot of good it does me.&quot;
	The truth of the matter was, however, that Ranma felt a whole lot 
better.  He loved Akane.  He would.and had.gone to the ends of the 
earth for her.  Sacrificed his cure to save her the same humiliation.  
Saved her from powerful evil and the best fighters on this or any 
planet.  Give up anything for her, even though he knew she would 
probably take it the wrong way and just get angry at him.  
	He smiled.  Just like now.
	

	Akane sat downstairs, drinking egg nog.  Nobody else was up, 
thank god.  Tears streamed down her face, making a small damp puddle at 
the base of her glass.  She was so angry.
	At herself.
	&quot;I&#39;m such a fucking asshole.&quot; She whimpered into the bottom of 
her mug before refilling it with some more of the thick, spicy liquid.  
This was her forth cup.  The problem with it was that it reminded her 
more and more about the feel of his breath in her mouth.  Thick and 
sweet.  
	&quot;Why did he have to tell me?&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I could have 
defended against anything else.&quot; She closed her eyes.  &quot;But he loves 
me.&quot;
	A tiny jingle at her feet made her look.  Mistletoe.  It must 
have fallen from the hall ceiling.  Without even sure why, she picked 
it up.  Examining it.  &quot;That does it.&quot; She stood (rather unsteadily) 
and began making her way to the stairs.  &quot;Once and for all.&quot;

	Once she was sure it was safe, Nabiki stepped out of the shadows 
and smiled to herself.  &quot;Merry Christmas, you two.  This one&#39;s free.&quot;
	In her arms was a bottle of &quot;Mr. Happy Eggnog Liquor&quot; and the 
hammer she had used to take the mistletoe down from the roof.  


	Ranma was lying awake in his bed.still dressed.  The clock only 
read five minutes from last he looked.  He knew he wasn&#39;t going to get 
any sleep anytime soon.  &quot;Akane.&quot; he sighed.  &quot;I love you.&quot; He paused, 
then smiled.  It felt good to say.  Felt right.
	The knock at the door startled him.  &quot;Yeah?&quot; he called out.
	&quot;I&#39;m coming in.&quot; Akane replied from outside.  &quot;Naked or not, here 
I come.&quot; She giggled slightly, then stumbled in.
	Ranma raised an eyebrow.  Akane was having trouble standing 
perfectly still.  &quot;Have you been drinking?&quot; he never expected himself 
having to ask Akane that.
	She frowned.  &quot;That eggnog is some fun stuff.&quot; she shook her 
head.  &quot;But I&#39;m not nearly as drunk as you probably think I am.&quot;
	&quot;I bet.&quot; Ranma sighed.  &quot;Goodnight.&quot; He turned around to sleep.
	Akane shook her head absentmindedly.  &quot;Oh no you don&#39;t.&quot; she 
knelt down and crawled over to his spot on the floor.  &quot;Ranma.I came to 
apologize.&quot;  You came to do a lot more than that!  Her mind whispered.
	Ranma was about to get up and lead her out when Akane collapsed 
against his chest, sobbing loudly.  &quot;A.akane?&quot; he blinked, only 
managing to sit up.
	She slowly stopped.  Muffled by his shirt.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Ranma.&quot; 
she whispered.  &quot;I&#39;ve been so mean to you.&quot;
	The warmth had returned.  Greater than before.  Akane was a 
little furnace against his chest, and he was cherishing it.  &quot;What&#39;s 
gotten into me?&quot; he chuckled weakly.  
	She looked up at his face with wet, shimmering eyes.  &quot;What do 
you mean?&quot;
	His arms came around her and held her close, careful not to put 
too much pressure on her, but also making sure he wouldn&#39;t lose her to 
some unknown force.  &quot;Yesterday, if someone were to tell me I would be 
holding you like this, I would have told them they were full of shit.&quot;
	A small smile crossed Akane&#39;s lips.
	&quot;That was right up until this morning.&quot; He whispered.  &quot;When I 
realized how much I wanted to kiss you.&quot;
	Her heartbeat doubled.  &quot;Did.you mean.what you said before??&quot;
	Ranma nodded. 
	Akane lifted herself off of him slightly to look in his eyes.  
&quot;Why did you say you were sorry?&quot;
	He closed his eyes.  &quot;I don&#39;t know.  Maybe because I wasn&#39;t sure 
if that was what you wanted to hear.  Maybe I was just sorry it took so 
long for me to say.&quot;
	&quot;What if it was exactly what I was hoping for?&quot; she whispered, 
mostly to herself.  &quot;I&#39;ve been so scared, Ranma.&quot; she placed her head 
against him again.  &quot;I was scared of falling in love with you, without 
you falling for me.&quot;
	Ranma gazed at the wall above her head, blinking slowly.  His 
heart smiled, placed it&#39;s hands on it&#39;s hips, and nodded.  &quot;I TOLD 
you.&quot; It said.  
	Akane could hear his heart beating a bit faster.  It was nice 
just to listen for once.  Soft thunder echoing in his chest.  A wave of 
warmth passed through her.  &quot;Ranma?&quot;
	&quot;Mmm?&quot;
	She looked up at him again.  &quot;Can we.still get into fights?&quot; she 
smiled.  &quot;Kick the shit out of each other?&quot; she said softly.  &quot;I don&#39;t 
want to lose anything just because we know we love each other now.&quot;
	Something VERY appealing about the way she said it.  Love.  Ranma 
could only nod.  &quot;Sure.&quot; He swallowed hard.  &quot;But we also gain a lot 
too.&quot;
	Akane, still feeling the edge of her fears dulled by the eggnog, 
smiled to herself.  &quot;Like what?&quot; she whispered.
	&quot;Well.I&#39;d really like it if we could do this more often.&quot; He 
replied.  &quot;Just hold each other without having to worry about leaving.&quot;
	&quot;Mmm.&quot; She hummed into his chest.  &quot;Okay.  What else?&quot;
	&quot;This is a dangerous conversation to be having when you&#39;re drunk, 
Akane.&quot; He said through a long breath.  Every ounce of his will power 
was going into keeping a repeat of that morning from happening again.  
	She must have seen the look of concentration on his face, because 
she smiled slightly.  &quot;One thing I have got to ask you, Ranma.&quot; she 
whispered, sliding up his front ever so slightly.
	&quot;Y-yeah?&quot;
	&quot;How come you always call me un-cute?&quot; she breathed with her 
mouth on his neck.  Her warm, sweet breath left a trail of heat along 
his throat.  
	&quot;Because.you are not cute.&quot; He said softly, eyes closed.  &quot;You&#39;re 
beautiful.&quot;
	She nuzzled the strong line of his cheek.just barely touching him 
with her nose.  &quot;Good answer.&quot; she said softly.  
	&quot;Akane.&quot; he whispered.  &quot;Please.&quot; his voice caught in his throat 
as her right breast traced a light trail against his shirt.  &quot;you&#39;re 
drunk.&quot; He said, not even convincing himself.  
	&quot;I told you.  I&#39;m not nearly as drunk as you think I am.&quot; She 
replied, slightly annoyed.  &quot;And even if I was.&quot; she cooed into his 
ear.  &quot;What makes you think I would object later on?&quot;
	He turned his head slightly towards hers.  &quot;You agreeing with 
something I do?&quot; he smiled.  &quot;I thought you said things weren&#39;t going 
to change.&quot;
	Akane raised her arm above his head.  &quot;Look up.&quot; She said, gazing 
into his eyes.
	Ranma looked up at her hand.  She was holding the cluster of 
mistletoe that had been in the hall.  He couldn&#39;t help but chuckle.  
Akane moved closer to him.  Any closer and she would have been sitting 
on his lap.  
	&quot;See?&quot; she said.  &quot;You have to now.  Drunk or not.&quot; She closed 
her eyes half way, then re-opened them.  &quot;We have to kiss now.&quot;
	He nodded slowly.  &quot;Just a kiss.&quot;
	She leaned into him slightly.  &quot;Just one.&quot; 
	Ranma almost didn&#39;t notice that their faces were only a breath 
apart.  &quot;It&#39;s not just a kiss.&quot; He said finally.
	That indescribable look of fire in Akane&#39;s eyes had returned, and 
she nodded slowly.  &quot;I know.&quot;
	Their eyelids lowered, and instinct guided him to where they had 
been before.  Her breath was hot.  Sweet and spicy from the eggnog.  It 
covered his tongue like a warm blanket as he swallowed the air 
greedily.  Akane&#39;s heart pounded into her ribs, urging her on.  She was 
in no hurry, though.  She wanted to let this moment play out for 
eternity.  
	
	Their lips touched.  Soft and moist, they drew the other in 
closer.  Locking together in one, perfect moment.

	Akane reminded herself to take back anything bad she had said 
about Ranma&#39;s kissing ability.  Within a heartbeat, she had melted into 
him.  Body pressed up against, she reached around his neck and brought 
his head closer.  
	And they kissed.  Long, wet, passionate kisses broken only by the 
occasional gasp for air.  A silent bond was formed that moment when 
they both realized this was meant to be.  They fit each other 
perfectly.  
	She finally lowered her forehead slightly as Ranma caught her 
upper lip in his.  His tongue slid along her lip gently, sending a 
shudder through her body.  
	Once again, she felt him against her front.  Even through all the 
clothes, she could feel him pressing against her.  &quot;It&#39;s not morning.&quot; 
She whispered.  &quot;No excuses now.&quot; 
	He blushed slightly, but smiled as they held their foreheads 
together.  &quot;You don&#39;t seem to mind it now.&quot;
	Akane tightened her stomach muscles, gently dragging herself up 
his body.  Ranma let out a low moan in response.  &quot;Neither do you.&quot; She 
whispered.  
	&quot;Akane.?&quot;
	&quot;Yeah?&quot; she replied with a hot, heavy sigh.  
	&quot;I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;ve been taking the pill or something.&quot; He 
said, knowing the answer.  
	&quot;No.&quot; Akane replied.  &quot;Shit.&quot;
	He nodded.  &quot;Then I think we&#39;re going to have to save the 
mistletoe for later.&quot;
	She nodded reluctantly.  &quot;I know.&quot; She breathed against his 
mouth.  &quot;But.&quot; she was having trouble thinking with the throbbing 
warmth against her bellybutton.  &quot;I don&#39;t want to go.&quot; She decided 
finally.
	&quot;I don&#39;t want you to go.&quot; He reassured her.  The weight of her 
breasts against him was making it hard to breathe as well.  It was one 
thing to have them half the time, and see them, but another thing 
entirely when they were someone you love&#39;s pressed up against you in 
full arousal.  
	
They stayed like that for a long time.  Just against each other.  
Akane finally sighed and unwrapped her arms from around Ranma&#39;s head. 
&quot;I better go.&quot;
	He could only nod.  It was going to be torture enough tonight 
without her here.  If she was sleeping on top of him, it wasn&#39;t going 
to get better.  
	They met in another kiss.  This one very tender.  Any more would 
have sparked the need to explore other areas of their anatomies.  Akane 
parted, but they were briefly joined by a thin string of saliva.  She 
leaned back in and gently licked it from Ranma&#39;s lips.    &quot;I&#39;ll see you 
later.&quot; She whispered.  
	He helped her to her feet and they walked over to his bedroom 
door.  &quot;We&#39;ll finish this some other time.&quot; He promised.  
	A silent flash of fire lit her eyes and she smiled.  &quot;I&#39;ll hold 
you to your word.&quot; She said, pressing up against him, enjoying the 
warmth for a few more seconds before finally opening the door.  
	Ranma watched her leave and smiled to himself.  &quot;You are soooooo 
un-cute.&quot; He whispered.
	She popped her head back in just long enough to smile, look down 
at the fabric of his pants and raise an eyebrow.  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t talk, 
hentai.&quot;
	&quot;Merry Christmas.&quot; He winked, then pushed her out of the door 
with a kiss.  


	Akane returned to her room, shutting the door with a pleasent sigh 
on her lips.  Perhaps Christmas wouldn&#39;t be so lonely this year after all.
