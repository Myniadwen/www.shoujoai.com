&quot;Oh and before we forget, Minister Exedore,&quot; Gloval said, &quot;since we are 
now allied together, I would like to return one of your people, a man 
named Kyron, who was injured in combat and captured. We haven&#39;t really 
had time to deal with it, but keeping him fed and his wounds treated 
have been a huge strain on our resources. We had planned to send him 
back soon anyway.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Exedore said. &quot;Well, do you think you could hold on to him until 
after the battle? He is a troublesome one and may cause us problems.&quot;

&quot;Well, yes I suppose a few hours won&#39;t make a difference,&quot; Gloval said.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Minister Exedore?&quot; Ranma asked, coming up to the man.

&quot;Yes, Commander?&quot; Exedore replied.

&quot;Do the Zentradi follow the code of personal challenge?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;It is a way of settling disputes between us,&quot; Exedore said. &quot;Why do you 
ask?&quot;

&quot;I was thinking, Human and Zentradi DNA are identical so the process 
that makes you big would also work for a human,&quot; Ranma said pensively. 
&quot;What if you were to make me Zentradi-sized and I challenged Dolza to 
single hand-to-hand combat? The stakes being that if I win, he leaves us 
alone?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm, very interesting suggestion,&quot; Exedore said. &quot;Properly worded, he 
would be forced to accept such a challenge or he would lose the respect 
of the Zentradi. It would have to be to the death though. I doubt 
anything less would stop him from attacking with the fleet. If you 
fought him to the death and won, Breetai is the next in line of 
succession. He could step in and take control of the Grand Fleet.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t like killing but if I have to, to save my people, I will,&quot; 
Ranma agreed.

&quot;Very well, I shall talk to Lord Breetai,&quot; Exedore said. &quot;We don&#39;t have 
much time though.&quot;

&quot;An excellent idea, Commander,&quot; Gloval said in approval. &quot;It would 
certainly save a lot of lives if you were successful.&quot;

&quot;Ranma are you sure about this?&quot; Lisa asked. &quot;This Dolza is probably a 
skilled fighter to be the supreme commander of a warrior culture.&quot;

&quot;We haven&#39;t got anything to lose at this point, Love,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;It&#39;s 
a risk I&#39;m willing to take to try to save lives.&quot;

Lisa hugged her tightly. &quot;That&#39;s why I love you,&quot; the brunette said to 
Ranma. &quot;But I do worry about you.&quot;

&quot;I know, I worry about you too, Love,&quot; Ranma said.

(oO\O/Oo)

As soon as Dolza&#39;s Flagship completed its defold operation, his comm 
screen appeared displaying Breetai&#39;s image.

&quot;Breetai,&quot; Dolza sneered. &quot;You have once again failed me.&quot;

&quot;That may be true, Lord Dolza, but it is irrelevant for the moment,&quot; 
Breetai said. &quot;For now, I am contacting you to inform you that you have 
been challenged to personal combat with a Micronian female. Please issue 
your challenge, Commander.&quot;

The view panned down to the control consol in front of Breetai and 
zoomed in on a tiny Micronian female that would have been engulfed in 
Breetai&#39;s palm.

&quot;Lord Dolza, Supreme Commander of the Zentradi,&quot; Ranma said grimly. &quot;I, 
Commander Ranma Saotome-Hayes, best fighter pilot on the SDF-1 and 
commanding officer of the SDF-1&#39;s fighter group, challenge you to 
one-on-one, hand-to-hand combat to the death. You may use any melee 
weapons that you wish. Should I win, hostilities between our people will 
cease and there will be peace between the Zentradi and the people of 
Earth. Will you agree to this challenge or will you cower behind your 5 
million ships, afraid to face one Micronian female? What say you, 
Dolza?&quot;

&quot;Before you answer, Lord Dolza, you should be aware that this 
transmission is being sent to the entire fleet,&quot; Breetai added.

Dolza blinked a few times trying to process the fact that this tiny 
Micronian had challenged him to hand-to-hand combat. Finally, he began 
to laugh hysterically.

&quot;Very well, foolish Micronian woman,&quot; Dolza said still chuckling. &quot;I 
must say, you Micronians do have courage far in excess of your size and 
intelligence. It is most amusing. I accept your challenge, since you are 
in such a rush to die before the rest of your people.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Arrangements were made for the place and time of the battle. It would 
take place in 6 hours on one of the cavernous hanger bays of Breetai&#39;s 
ship. Until then, Ranma was shuttled off to Azonia&#39;s ship where she 
would be Macronized and given a Meltradi uniform to wear.

Four hours later, Ranma stepped out of the Macronizaion chamber and 
looked at herself. In truth, she felt no different than before. The only 
thing that gave away the change was the fact that everything looked much 
smaller now.

&quot;Greetings, Commander,&quot; Azonia said with a grin, looking Ranma&#39;s naked 
form over with an odd half-smile. &quot;You&#39;re a bit on the small side, but 
you would make a fine Meltradi,&quot; the shorthaired Meltradi commander 
assessed. &quot;I have your uniform and undergarments.&quot; Azonia handed them 
over.

&quot;Um...thanks,&quot; Ranma said, noticing the odd sound of her voice. It 
seemed to have a lot more frequencies than it had before.

&quot;As soon as you are dressed, I will take you to select your weapons,&quot; 
Azonia said. &quot;You will then have some time to practice with them and 
your body. You have much courage to face Dolza. He is the greatest 
fighter of our people.&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Ranma smirked. &quot;I guess you could say I&#39;m the greatest of mine at 
the moment. I&#39;m not the most skilled fighter on Earth, but I&#39;m likely 
one of the best of my generation. From what I&#39;ve seen, Dolza isn&#39;t much 
of a threat to me in either form. I may need to be Macronized in order 
to be a threat to him, but he couldn&#39;t touch me otherwise.&quot;

&quot;You have much confidence,&quot; Azonia said solemnly. &quot;I hope for both our 
sakes it is not misplaced.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Ranma said, placing her hand on Azonia&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I had 
ten years of the most intense combat training you could imagine, stuff 
that would give even the most battle hardened Zentradi screaming 
nightmares, backed by nearly eight years to hone my skills. Believe me 
when I say I&#39;m not worried.&quot; Azonia nodded.

&quot;Come, I will take you to the armory,&quot; Azonia said.

Once there, Ranma perused the available melee weapons. She avoided the 
various knives and swords, instead, selecting a pair of Tonfa-like 
weapons and a long metallic bo-staff.

&quot;If I might ask, Commander,&quot; Azonia asked curiously, &quot;why have you 
chosen non-lethal weapons for a death match? Why not a blade?&quot;

&quot;Like guns, blades have their place, Azonia,&quot; Ranma smiled. &quot;They&#39;re not 
really my style normally. It&#39;s too easy to kill or maim by accident. 
It&#39;s not really a concern here, but the Tonfa and the staff can equally 
as deadly as the blade when used right. Besides that, I know loads of 
lethal techniques that can be done with my bare hands.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Azonia gulped. Could it be that this Ranma was truly that 
dangerous?

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;So what are we going to do about this, Gentlemen?&quot; one of the joint 
chiefs asked the others.

&quot;What can we do? I mean, there&#39;s nearly five million warships in orbit 
around the Earth,&quot; a general said.

&quot;I think we should let this &#39;challenge&#39; play out,&quot; an admiral suggested. 
&quot;Maybe the aliens will abide by the terms should Don&#39;s &#39;daughter-in-law&#39; 
win.&quot; There were a couple of snickers around the table at the thought of 
Admiral Hayes&#39; daughter being in a lesbian marriage. Hayes growled 
darkly.

&quot;How could that happen?&quot; the first man said. &quot;I mean look at her. Sure, 
she&#39;s a great pilot but what chance does a tiny girl like that stand 
against one of those monsters?&quot;

&quot;They say she&#39;s the best hand-to-hand fighter in the RDF,&quot; the admiral 
argued. &quot;You all saw the recording of the conference. She may have a 
good shot.&quot;

&quot;Enough!&quot; Admiral Hayes commanded. &quot;Even if that perverted...even if 
this woman wins, these aliens are completely untrustworthy. Here is what 
I propose, we let the challenge proceed and once the aliens&#39; attention 
is on the fight...&quot;

Hayes laid out his plan. And hour&#39;s worth of arguing later, the Joint 
Chiefs approved it, although some of them quite reluctantly.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma finished the bo staff kata in amazement. She was surprised to find 
that she had suffered no degradation of her abilities in the 
macronization process. Her speed, strength, and ki had all increased in 
proportion to her size. It felt more like the world had shrunk around 
her than the other way around.

&quot;It&#39;s time,&quot; Azonia said, entering the room.

&quot;Let&#39;s do it,&quot; Ranma said, her eyes flashing with determination and her 
face going grim.

Ranma collected her weapons and followed Azonia to the shuttle that 
would take them to Breetai&#39;s ship. The shuttle ride was short and after 
they got off the shuttle, Azonia led Ranma through the corridors to the 
specified hanger bay.

Entering the room Ranma saw that Akane, Max, and Miriya were there in 
their battloids. There were also various Zentradi officers from both 
sides. Glancing at the observation window, Ranma saw that Lisa and Roy 
were there to watch as well. Finally her eyes met Dolza&#39;s from where he 
stood at the opposite end of the room.

&quot;So, Micronian, you&#39;ve been macronized,&quot; Dolza grinned wickedly. &quot;It 
won&#39;t help you.&quot; As the second tallest Zentradi in the room, second only 
to Breetai, Dolza still towered head and shoulders above her. Ranma was 
only a little taller than Exedore and appeared nearly as frail. Dolza 
was judging a book by its cover and he was in for a rude shock.

&quot;Oh I think you might be surprised,&quot; Ranma said grimly. &quot;If you&#39;re 
through with your pathetic posturing let&#39;s get on with it.&quot;

&quot;Yes, let&#39;s,&quot; Dolza said. &quot;I have a planet to destroy.&quot; He opened his 
robe and removed it, handing it to his second. His bare, thickly muscled 
chest was revealed as he stood wearing only a pair of trousers and 
boots. Old scars covered his torso from his obvious battle experience. 
He took two curved swords from another Zentradi and swung them 
experimentally to loosen up his muscles.

Ranma handed her weapons to Breetai and removed her Meltradi jacket and 
handed it to Azonia. Wearing only a t-shirt type top and her Meltradi 
leggings, she took the bo staff back from Breetai and strode 
nonchalantly out into the center of the room. Twirling the bo staff 
around her, moving it so fast it blurred from sight, she ended up in an 
open stance, slightly crouched with one leg poised in the air in front 
of her with the staff under her underarm and pointed straight out to the 
side. With her free hand she beckoned Dolza to bring it on.

Dolza approached and dropped into a half crouch, his swords held 
defensively before him. Slowly, he began to circle Ranma. She matched 
his circling, waiting for him to make his move.

Suddenly, Dolza exploded into motion, whirling like a dervish, slashing 
out at Ranma with the curved swords. Steel clanged against steel as she 
deflected his strikes with her spinning staff. Ranma was forced to give 
up ground under the onslaught.

Ranma back-flipped away from Dolza and then leaped high into the air, 
swinging the staff in a vicious whistling arc toward the top of Dolza&#39;s 
bald head. Dolza was forced to dive inelegantly to the floor to avoid 
the blow. He quickly rolled to his feet and turned to find Ranma waiting 
for him to rise.

&quot;I see you are not without some skill, little one,&quot; Dolza said. &quot;It will 
not avail you.&quot;

&quot;You talk too much,&quot; Ranma said, leaping forward, her staff spinning too 
fast for the eye to follow.

Dolza found himself pressed on the defensive and blows seemed to 
materialize from out of nowhere amidst the spinning arcs of the 
whistling staff. It was everything Dolza could do to maintain his 
defense. Suddenly, to Dolza&#39;s shock, one of his swords shattered. He 
threw the hilt at the redhead to try to disrupt her motion but she 
merely shifted her head aside and let the impromptu projectile pass by 
her.

Dolza was now completely absorbed in blocking the half-seen blows coming 
in from Ranma&#39;s blurring staff with his one remaining blade. It was a 
total shock when he raised his blade to deflect a high diagonal strike 
and felt an impact in his solar plexus. The air exploded out of his 
lungs even as his body flew back and slammed hard into the bulkhead. His 
remaining sword went clattering out of reach across the floor.

Dolza looked up from where he was sitting on the deck against the wall, 
gasping for breath. He saw Ranma standing with her leg still raised from 
the kick. She lowered her foot and spun the staff around before bringing 
it to a sharp stop along the back of her forearm.

&quot;You may know how to run a mechanized battle, Dolza, but I find you 
skills as a warrior...lacking,&quot; Ranma stated in a matter of fact tone. 
She tossed her staff to Breetai. &quot;I don&#39;t even need a weapon to tear you 
apart.&quot;

Gasps filled the room as the greatest of all Zentradi was so cavalierly 
dismissed as a threat. What&#39;s more, many feared this was exactly the 
case.

&quot;I will not be made a fool of by a mere female!&quot; Dolza roared having 
regained his breath.

The Zentradi supreme commander leapt to his feet and charged Ranma. 
Ranma flipped into the air, springing off Dolza&#39;s head and landed a 
two-heeled kick to his lower back, which sent him sliding across the 
deck on his face. Dolza leaped up immediately, blood now running down 
his face from the broken nose he received from his face impacting on the 
floor.

&quot;Look at you,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Face all bloody, breathing hard, sweating. 
You might as well just fall on your own sword and save me the trouble of 
having to kill you. You&#39;re pathetic.&quot;

Just then a frantic commotion from over near Breetai distracted Ranma 
for a moment. Dolza saw the opening and charged in. The large Zentradi 
drove his shoulder into the redhead&#39;s solar plexus and picked her up, 
never breaking stride. Ranma was stunned as the air was unexpectedly 
driven from her lungs. She was unable to do anything as Dolza slammed 
her at full speed into the bulkhead, driving his shoulder deeper into 
her.

Ranma tried to cover up as best she could as stars exploded into her 
vision. The blows began to rain down on her brutally. She felt her ribs 
crack as Dolza drove his knee into them repeatedly while keeping her 
pinned to the wall. If Dolza had continued with his relentless assault, 
he might have beaten her, but he made a critical and fatal error.

Believing his strength to be superior, now that he had her in his grasp, 
he wrapped his hands around her throat and lifted her up off the floor 
and high against the wall, intent on strangling the life out of her. 
This allowed Ranma to bring her feet into play. She kicked him hard in 
the ribs but he was too focused on maintaining the pressure on her neck. 
She tried again, this time in the face, but again the results were 
ignored.

As the edges of her vision began to blacken, Ranma had an inspiration. 
Holding on to his wrists and using them for an anchor, she hooked her 
right foot behind his neck and the left she placed on the side of his 
face. With only seconds of consciousness left, she sharply extended her 
left foot with all her strength, twisting his head back and to the side.

There was a loud, sickening crack and suddenly she was on the floor on 
her hands and knees gasping for breath. Looking over she saw Dolza lying 
on the deck with his neck twisted at an odd angle. He was very much 
dead. She had snapped his neck with that last move with only moments 
before she herself would have been the one lying on the deck dead.

Breetai walked over to her, going to one knee before her and placing a 
hand on her shoulder.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; he asked. Ranma nodded and coughed a couple of times, 
one hand going to rub her throat.

&quot;I was...stupid,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I let...myself...be distracted. What was 
all that commotion?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know how to tell you this, but an attack was launched from the 
planet,&quot; Breetai said grimly. &quot;It took out a third of the Grand Fleet. 
The rest retaliated with a full-scale bombardment. We estimate that 
nearly fifty percent of the planet&#39;s surface was destroyed.&quot;

A loud clang brought the attention of everyone in the room.

&quot;No,&quot; Ranma breathed, her fist still resting in the depression in the 
deck and her whole body wreathed in blue flames. &quot;Those unbelievable 
fools. We almost had this problem solved. Nobody else had to die. All 
those innocent people...&quot; Ranma looked up at Breetai, tears streaming 
down her face. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry. Once again I&#39;ve been shamed by the actions 
of the leadership of my planet. That attack was totally dishonorable.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t your doing,&quot; Breetai said. &quot;It means nothing to our 
arrangement. I, too, regret the deaths that they caused, but it is time 
to look beyond that. You have defeated Dolza. Even now I have taken 
steps to take command. It should be remarkably easy. Dolza was as big a 
fool as those in control on your planet. In his arrogance in the 
Zentradi superiority, he made no contingencies in the event of his 
defeat. I will honor the terms of his defeat, this I swear on my honor 
as a warrior.&quot;

Breetai stuck out his hand to Ranma and she clasped forearms with him in 
friendship and mutual respect. Breetai helped her up and steadied her as 
the pain from her fractured ribs caused her to sway somewhat.

&quot;You are a warrior like no other I&#39;ve seen,&quot; Azonia said as Ranma and 
Breetai approached the group. &quot;Not many would have survived that 
pummeling you took and remained strong enough to do what you did. It is 
an honor you have met you, Ranma Saotome-Hayes.&quot; She and Ranma clasped 
forearms.

&quot;So I gotta ask,&quot; Ranma said, &quot;can I change back to normal size with 
broken ribs, or do I have to wait until they heal?&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;RANMA!&quot; Lisa exclaimed as Ranma stepped out of the micronization 
chamber. &quot;Oh Ranma, I was so scared!&quot;

Ranma looked up to see Lisa bearing down on her. She screwed her eyes 
shut and braced herself for the painful glomp her ribs were about to 
receive. Instead she felt gentle hands on either side of her head and 
then she was being thoroughly kissed. When Lisa released her, Ranma 
cracked one eye open.

&quot;What?&quot; Lisa asked, smiling. &quot;Did you think I was going to crush your 
ribs?&quot; Ranma opened both eyes and looked sheepish. &quot;Don&#39;t be silly, 
Sweetie. Your whole torso is like one big bruise. I wouldn&#39;t want to 
hurt you.&quot;

&quot;That was amazing, Mom,&quot; Miriya said. &quot;I knew you were skilled, but I 
never thought you could handle Dolza as easily as you did.&quot;

&quot;How do your ribs feel?&quot; Akane asked.

&quot;They hurt like hell,&quot; Ranma grinned wryly.

&quot;Good, that&#39;ll teach you to stay focused on the fight,&quot; Akane smirked.

&quot;Ooooo,&quot; Ranma said evilly, while Lisa gently toweled her off, &quot;somebody 
wants an extra long sparring session with sensei.&quot; Akane shook her head 
rapidly and gulped. &quot;It&#39;s okay Akane. You happen to be right. I did let 
myself be distracted and now I&#39;m paying for it. At least the 
Protoculture chamber gave me a few days head start on the healing 
process. So how are things?&quot;

&quot;Breetai is now in control of the Zentradi fleet and has relocated the 
bulk of them, including his new flagship to the far side of the Moon,&quot; 
Lisa said. &quot;We&#39;ve determined that 47 percent of the Earth&#39;s surface has 
been destroyed, including just about every major population center. 
There are survivors, but we estimate up to 70 percent of the population 
died in the Zentradi retaliation.&quot;

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Ranma cursed. &quot;Lisa, please understand, I mean this in the 
nicest way, but if your father lived, I&#39;m gonna beat him to death.&quot;

&quot;Not if I get there first,&quot; Lisa said grimly. &quot;Anyway, Breetai has 
offered us several of his ships that we can land in various locations 
around the world to use for assisting survivors by providing them power 
and shelter until the infrastructure can be reestablished.&quot;

&quot;What about the government?&quot; Ranma asked, finished getting dressed.

&quot;It&#39;s either mostly gone or in hiding,&quot; Lisa said as they left the room 
and headed toward the shuttle bay. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter anyway. Too much 
of the infrastructure has been destroyed for them to be effective 
anyway. And once the story gets out about what happened, they won&#39;t be 
very popular among the survivors.&quot;

&quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Akane asked.

&quot;Well, that has yet to be decided,&quot; Lisa explained. &quot;The command staff 
of the SDF-1 is most likely the highest ranking governmental unit left 
intact, at least that&#39;s reliable.&quot;

&quot;One thing we have to get started on right away is setting up some 
processing stations to get clean water out to survivors,&quot; Ranma said. 
&quot;Then we&#39;ll likely have to airlift it all over the world. After that I 
want to round up any of the fucking imbeciles that fired the fucking 
cannon and beat the hell out of them.&quot;

&quot;There are already plans to charge them,&quot; Lisa said as they entered the 
shuttle bay.

&quot;Ah there you are, Ranma Saotome-Hayes,&quot; Azonia said cheerfully. &quot;I 
wanted to see you off and congratulate you again on your glorious 
victory.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Azonia,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;It wasn&#39;t all that glorious though. If 
nobody had died, then it would have been glorious.&quot;

&quot;As you say,&quot; Azonia said. &quot;However the deaths were not you fault. A lot 
more would have died but for your courage and skill.&quot;

&quot;I only did what I had to,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;But thanks for appreciating it. 
And thanks for your hospitality.&quot;

&quot;Certainly,&quot; Azonia smiled. &quot;It was my honor.&quot;

&quot;If you like, maybe you can get micronized and visit me,&quot; Ranma 
suggested. &quot;I&#39;d be happy to take you on as a student of the art if you 
like.&quot;

&quot;You would teach me your fighting art?&quot; Azonia asked, surprised.

&quot;Sure, why not?&quot; Ranma smiled. &quot;Miriya says you were a good commander to 
serve under. I&#39;d be willing to teach you if you want.&quot;

&quot;You do me great honor, Commander,&quot; Azonia said.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma looked stunned as Max drove the jeep down the streets of Macross 
City on their way from the shuttle bay. Every inhabitant aboard the ship 
lined their route, cheering as they passed. People were throwing 
streamers and confetti and the rear compartment of the jeep where Ranma 
was sitting flanked by Lisa and Akane was filled with bouquets of 
flowers that had been thrown in by the crowds.

&quot;Wha...what&#39;s going on?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;The fight between you and Dolza was televised,&quot; Lisa explained with a 
proud smile. &quot;You&#39;re the hero of the people now.&quot; Lisa giggled. &quot;If you 
thought being Miss Macross was bad, you&#39;re really in for it now. You&#39;re 
a certified celebrity now.&quot;

&quot;Great,&quot; Ranma said depressed.

&quot;So tell us, Miss Macross,&quot; Max said over his shoulder, &quot;now that you&#39;ve 
saved the world from the ridiculously powerful alien threat, what are 
you going to do now?&quot;

&quot;Um...go to Disneyworld?&quot; Ranma deadpanned. Everyone in the jeep laughed 
at that, except for Miriya who didn&#39;t understand the cultural joke.

&quot;You know, Pop would be eating this up,&quot; Ranma said to Lisa and Akane 
while Max explained the joke to Miriya. &quot;Literally.&quot;

&quot;Ranma...do you think our father&#39;s survived?&quot; Akane asked, subdued.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, Akane,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;They were in Tokyo so I don&#39;t think 
the chances were very good. I sure hope my father-in-law lived though.&quot; 
Ranma said, cracking her knuckles.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Captain, we are entering Earth&#39;s atmosphere,&quot; Claudia reported.

&quot;Very well,&quot; Captain Gloval said. &quot;Steady as she goes.&quot;

&quot;Captain,&quot; Sammy reported, &quot;we&#39;re receiving a signal on the command 
frequency.&quot;

&quot;So, some of them did survive,&quot; Gloval said. &quot;Very well, put it on the 
speaker.&quot;

&quot;SDF-1, this is the North American Defense Command, you are ordered not 
to approach the surface of the Earth,&quot; the speaker said. &quot;If you 
continue your approach we will be forced to fire on you.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; several people on the bridge exclaimed.

&quot;North American Defense Command, why do you persist in these unlawful 
orders?&quot; Gloval demanded.

&quot;SDF-1, you have allied yourselves with the enemy,&quot; the speaker said. 
&quot;You will not be allowed to land.&quot;

&quot;There is no enemy anymore, no thanks to you paranoid egomaniacal 
idiots,&quot; Gloval growled. &quot;Who is in charge there? I demand to speak with 
them at once.&quot;

&quot;Gloval, this is General Howard of the Joint Chiefs,&quot; Howard said. &quot;You 
had no authority to make any kind of treaty with the enemy. You have 
been labeled a traitor and you will not be allowed to land on this 
planet.&quot;

&quot;You brainless, running-dog bastard,&quot; Gloval snarled. &quot;We saved the 
planet from annihilation. It was the actions of the UNEDC that caused 
the destruction of 47 percent of the Earth&#39;s surface. You no longer have 
the authority to give me orders. As much as I hate to say it, if you 
fire on us, we WILL, I repeat, WILL return fire. Do not cause any more 
needless deaths and add to the charges that you and the rest of the 
Joint Chiefs will face.&quot;

&quot;How dare you presume to give me orders, Gloval?&quot; General Howard 
snapped. &quot;I am a general in the EDC. I give the orders here.&quot;

&quot;You are wrong, General,&quot; Gloval stated. &quot;The United Nations of Earth is 
no more. Currently, anarchy exists without the infrastructure to 
maintain order. You do not represent the people of Earth. You are just a 
man with a private little army. And General, do not forget, in anarchy, 
he with the most effective means to enforce his will has the control. 
You cannot hope to be successful in any attack against my people. We are 
all battle-hardened veterans with hundreds of hours of the most intense 
combat you can imagine against forces far superior to your meager 
forces.

&quot;We will land. And we will begin relief efforts for the survivors of the 
rain of death that the UNEDC brought down on the Earth. That is all, 
General.&quot;

Gloval cut the line and sighed heavily.

&quot;Lisa, if they fire on us, I want the position fixed and I want that 
location destroyed,&quot; Gloval said. &quot;Roy, put the fighters on alert. As 
soon as we can, I want a fighter screen launched.&quot;

&quot;Sir,&quot; Vanessa reported, &quot;we have incoming fighters. I count twenty 
signatures.&quot;

&quot;Sammy, get them on the comm, please,&quot; Gloval said.

&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Sammy acknowledged. &quot;Go head when you&#39;re ready, Sir.&quot;

&quot;This is Captain Henry Gloval of the SDF-1 to incoming fighters,&quot; Gloval 
said. &quot;If you have been ordered to attack, you have been given unlawful 
orders. I urge you not to fire on fellow citizens of Earth. Please turn 
back, or if you fear reprisals from you commanding officer, join us. I 
strongly caution you not to fire on us. If fired upon we will defend 
ourselves. You cannot hope to be successful if you intend us harm. This 
ship has more than enough firepower to make twenty fighters a mild 
annoyance. Please reconsider your intent.&quot;

&quot;Sir it looks like seven...nine...no, twelve fighters have broken 
formation and are headed away,&quot; Vanessa reported.

&quot;Commander Fokker, are we able to launch fighters yet?&quot; Gloval asked.

&quot;Yes, Sir, in about thirty seconds,&quot; Roy said.

&quot;I want Wild Rose out there to intercept,&quot; Gloval said. &quot;Maybe if they 
won&#39;t listen to reason they can be intimidated away by our fighters 
flying rings around them.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sir, I&#39;ll have Rose Squadron in the air ASAP,&quot; Roy smirked.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;All right Rose&#39;s listen up,&quot; Ranma said. She had chosen to fly the 
mission in spite of Kasumi&#39;s recommendation that she should take it easy 
until her ribs completely knitted. Ranma was used to performing in pain 
though. &quot;Alpha and Bravo flights are going to intercept the incoming 
fighters and stick on them like white on rice. I want you to get and 
maintain a missile lock on them but do not fire unless they do. Charlie 
flight will loiter around the SDF-1 against anything unexpected. Is that 
clear?&quot;

Everyone acknowledged.

&quot;Wild Rose Lead to incoming aircraft,&quot; Ranma broadcast. &quot;You are warned 
not to approach the SDF-1. If you do not comply you will be forced from 
the sky. If you fire on the SDF-1 or my fighters, you will be splashed. 
Come on guys, you&#39;re out numbered and out gunned. Don&#39;t throw your lives 
away for a bunch of self-serving rear echelon assholes that no longer 
have any authority thanks to their own actions.&quot;

&quot;Why should we listen to you?&quot; one of the pilots said. &quot;You&#39;re traitors 
who have allied yourselves with the aliens that killed our families.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be stupid,&quot; Ranma snapped. &quot;The only reason this planet isn&#39;t a 
smoking cinder is because we reached a peace accord with the aliens. And 
don&#39;t give me any of that shit about the alien threat either. Who do you 
think has been fighting that threat for the last two years while you 
were all safe in your beds? We were, goddamit! As for the aliens killing 
your families, I personally killed the one responsible for that. The 
alien leadership has changed and the new leader has offered assistance 
in providing relief for the survivors. Anyway, it was the leadership of 
the UNEDC that killed your families by firing on the aliens during a 
cease-fire agreement. I deeply regret the loss of life. It was 
unnecessary. If the aliens hadn&#39;t been fired upon they wouldn&#39;t have 
fired the retaliatory bombardment.&quot;

&quot;So you say,&quot; the angry pilot said. &quot;Why should we believe you?&quot;

&quot;Frankly, I don&#39;t give a shit whether you believe me or not at this 
point,&quot; Ranma growled. &quot;If the aliens still had hostile intentions 
towards Earth, we&#39;d all be dead right now. If you want to die, then keep 
coming. We are veterans of two years of constant combat against 
adversaries technologically superior to anything you can send against 
us. You haven&#39;t got a chance. Don&#39;t be a fool.&quot;

At this point the two forces met and all eight planes broke, trying to 
get the others in their sights. The hostile aircraft quickly found 
themselves with missile locks on their aircraft. The next two minutes 
were spent with them frantically trying everything they could think of 
to shake the Roses off their six, but the pink and white aircraft were 
stuck to them like glue.

&quot;Fuck this,&quot; one of the pilots said and bugged out. One by one each of 
the remaining planes followed until the sky was clear of enemy aircraft.

&quot;Gunsight 2, Wild Rose Lead, Hostiles are headed home,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;No 
shots fired.&quot;

&quot;Roger, Wild Rose Lead,&quot; Roy said. &quot;Maintain CAP.&quot;

&quot;Roger, Gunsight 2,&quot; Ranma said and instructed her three flights to 
begin orbiting the SDF-1.
