<h2>Heart of Steel </h2>
<p>Ukyo looked at the impression of Tsubasa’s face in her  spatula as she gasped for breath, then slowly raised her eyes to look around at  the devastated shop. One really didn’t need the neon blue battle aura around  her to know she was beyond pissed.</p><p>
  “I take it you are not pleased by my choice.” Her  father’s voice was disdainful.</p><p>
  “What gave you the clue, dad?” She whirled to glare at  him. “There are no circumstances in the world under which I would marry that  pervert! <em>I’LL DIE FIRST!</em>”</p><p>
  “I’m not <em>asking</em> you to, Son. I’m <em>telling</em> you. Miss  Kurenai has told me about how you would have pledged your hand to her had you  not already been on your quest.”</p><p>
  “<em>ARE YOU  BLIND!!!</em>”  In rage, Ukyo ripped the  dress off the unconscious Tsubasa, revealing the distinct lack of feminine  attributes on his chest. “He’s a fucking <em>CROSS-DRESSER!!!</em>”</p><p>
  Her father was unmoved. “Then that makes her perfect  for you, <em>SON</em>.” He shrugged, “It  matters not to me. I <em>WILL</em> see you  married before the year is out. I have a dozen other girls in mind as well. One  of them will be suitable, I’m sure.”</p><p>
  Ukyo’s mouth opened and closed but no sound came out.  Her hands had begun crushing the spatula’s shaft as her aura began scorching  the roof. There was no thought beyond murder in her eyes.</p><p>
  But before she could move, a small figure interposed  herself between her and her father.</p><p>
  “Please sir, is no way will release Ukyo from this?”</p><p>
  Ukyo gobbled in shock, but didn’t move.</p><p>
  The elder Kuonji shook his head. “I swore an oath upon  my ancestors honor. Ukyo has dishonored that vow. Now I must do what I must.”</p><p>
  “Then honored sir has left no choice.”</p><p>
  “What are you doing, Zhu Shu?” Ukyo’s voice was  strained with the tension of holding back her desire to commit patricide.</p><p>
  “Is only honorable course Zhu Shu can see.” She knelt  before Ukyo’s father and pulled from behind her back an ornate scarlet and gold  box. She placed it on the ground before her and closed her eyes, taking a deep  breath as the nervousness nearly prevented her from speaking. From the side Lo  Shen looked on curiously, trying to figure out what her charge was up to.</p><p>
  Before terror could stop her, Zhu Shu repeated the  words she had rehearsed so many times in her dreams that no trace of her accent  marred them.</p><p>
  “If you cannot release Ukyo from her vows, then there  is only one honorable choice I can make. I am Song Zhu Shu, Heir of Clan  Dragon, Master of the Song School of Sword Dance, and with this gift, I  respectfully request the hand of your <em>son</em> in marriage.”</p><p>
  As she opened the box, she could hear Ukyo’s spatula  clatter to the floor, and Lo Shen’s sigh.</p><p>
  Ukyo’s father lifted one of the porcelain teacups of  the set that had been recovered from the Musk fortress, his eyes expertly  appraising the small rubies and the delicate gold scrollwork.</p><p>
  “This is exquisite. Ming Dynasty if I’m not mistaken.”  He carefully replaced it next to the solid gold teapot and the fine silk  tablecloth. “This is priceless.” He said finally.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu still had her head bowed respectfully. “So is  Ukyo.”</p><p>
  He looked over to Lo Shen. “I do not know you, Elder,  but I can see from your bearing that you are wise. So I must ask, is this match  a worthy one for my son?”</p><p>
  Lo Shen cackled. “A far better one than you had  planned, sonny. I’m a bit surprised that Zhu Shu was so hasty, and I doubt she’s  thought it through in her desire to help Ukyo, but what’s done cannot be undone.  My niece, the heir of the Song Dynasty, True Empress of China, Ruler of the Celestial City, Daughter of the Dragon, and liege  of the Joketsuzoku, has spoken her heart. The ball is now in your court,  Kuonji.”</p><p>
  Ukyo’s face had grown whiter with each title Lo Shen  had pronounced, her battle aura extinguished like a candle blown out by a gale.</p><p>
  Her father nodded. “Indeed. A fine catch. Ukyo, any  objections?” His tone made it clear he could care less if there were, but Ukyo  still hadn’t found her voice. He nodded at her frozen expression. “Very well,  I, Koda Kuonji, Head of the Kuonji Clan, Master of the Kuonji School of Combat  Okonomiyaki Chefs, accept your dowry and approve your betrothal to my <em>son</em>, Ukyo Kuonji.”</p><p>
  The breath Zhu Shu had been holding left her in a  whoosh.</p><p>
  “Welcome to the family, daughter. I know you shall  never be the disappointment my son has been.” He gave the still unmoving girl a  look. “Expect the formal papers within the week, Ukyo. Your wedding will take  place before your eighteenth birthday.” He turned and left, his back stiff and  unforgiving. A moment latter the driver came in with an apologetic look to  collect the unconscious Tsubasa and the tea set.</p><p>
  For long moments not a word was spoken, then finally  Ukyo slumped in a seat morosely. “Well, at least <em>someone</em> got what they  wanted,” she said bitterly.</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu only meant to-”</p><p>
  “<em>I KNOW WHAT YOU  MEANT TO DO!!! YOU FUCKING HAD IT PLANNED!!! YOU EVEN HAD YOUR WORDS REHEARSED!!!</em>”</p><p>
  “Uc-chan-” Zhu Shu started to try to explain again.</p><p>
  “I don’t want to hear it! Just go! I don’t think I can  stand to look at you right now, Zhu Shu! You just made my worst nightmare a  reality and I don’t think you have any right to expect me to thank you for it!”</p><p>
  With a sob, the diminutive girl fled. Ukyo turned as  Lo Shen sighed heavily. “And I suppose you’re going to tell me I’m being  entirely unfair.” Ukyo said to her sullenly.</p><p>
  Lo Shen shrugged. “That is for you to decide. But  there is one thing you should know. In her mind, she just threw away her own  honor to save you. There is no way to take back what has been done.  You <em>are</em> the Empress’s Betrothed.  For <em>your</em> sake, she has abandoned her duty to  her clan, her god, and her subjects. In her desperation to save you from your  father’s idiocy she just gave up the most precious gift she had to give. She will  never <em>force</em> you to be her lover, or  even try to stop you from finding a man to love, but it will put an end to this  foolishness of your father trying to make you marry someone else.” She sprayed  herself with the water spout from the soda machine, one of the few intact items  in the shop, and resumed her school girl form.   “And now, I have to go and convene a council of elders to determine her  fate,” she said grimly before making her way out of the wreckage.</p><p>
  Then, there was only silence.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>It was nearly an hour later before anyone poked their  head through the door, and Ukyo still hadn’t moved.</p><p>
  But it wasn’t anyone she was expecting.</p><p>
  “I guess they figured I wouldn’t kill a miko out of  hand, huh?” she said as Rei waved a small white handkerchief.</p><p>
  “Actually, I’m the only one she allowed to come.  Lo Shen kept the other girls in the dojo along  with Ranma, Shan Pu and Akane. Zhu Shu has locked herself in her room and  wouldn’t even talk to me, and most everyone else is too angry that she’s upset  to actually <em>talk</em> instead of scream.  Lo Shen had to put up some sort of spell to  keep them from coming over here and picking a fight.”</p><p>
  “I see.”  Ukyo  put her head in her hands. “So why did <em>you</em> come?”</p><p>
  “Because I am in love with her. And because I can  never have her. Not permanently.”</p><p>
  Ukyo looked up at the priestess in shock. “What?”</p><p>
  Rei sat down across from her. “When I first saw Zhu  Shu, she was standing on the roof of my shrine. The girls and I thought she  might be a youma, and unfortunately, we nearly killed her.”</p><p>
  Ukyo blinked. “Youma?” She shook her head. “I’ve seen  you guys practice. There’s no way you’re good enough to have even touched her.”</p><p>
  “As <em>Rei Hino</em>,  no. As Sailor Mars, I’m afraid I tried rather hard, thinking she was a threat.”</p><p>
  “You’re a Sailor Senshi?!?”</p><p>
  Rei pulled out  her wand and did her henshin before she tossed it on the table under Ukyo’s  shocked expression. “Yes.  And when we  saw her change into her cursed form, our immediate conclusion was that she had  been possessed by a Cardian. We attacked her, and Jupiter nearly electrocuted  her. When we  realized she was human, I  was devastated. I couldn’t believe I had been so quick to overlook all the  training I had as a priestess and had been so willing to see only a face value,  to see her cursed form only as a monster that needed to be destroyed. It went  against every thing I stood for as a priestess and a Warrior of the Moon Kingdom.  I took care of her, and when she had recovered, I became her friend.  We all did. Before she came out and told any  of us her preferences, I knew. And I tortured myself by not wanting to admit to  myself that I was attracted to her.”</p><p>
  “Listen, I’m not-”</p><p>
  “<em>Shut up.</em> I’m not talking as a fifteen year old girl here, or even Sailor Mars. I’m  talking to you as a <em>priestess</em>. You <em>need</em> to know this.”</p><p>
  Ukyo sighed but held her tongue.</p><p>
  Rei nodded. “Good. Anyway, we became friends, and we  helped her on her quest to find Ranma for Shan Pu.”</p><p>
  “Do <em>they</em> know?”</p><p>
  “That we’re the Sailor Senshi? Yes. That’s why Zhu Shu  was reluctant to let you join our class. But Zhu Shu is one of us too. And  unfortunately, it took her death for me to finally overcome my fears about  loving her.”</p><p>
  “What?” Ukyo’s face was disbelieving. “But, but”</p><p>
  “I know she told you about her attempted suicide, but  what you don’t know is that it wasn’t an <em>attempt</em>.  Zhu Shu has <em>died</em> twice.” Rei  shuddered. “The second time, it was in my arms as I realized finally what she  meant to me.” She pulled a small DVD player out of her purse and handed it to  Ukyo. “That’s the record from Ami’s computer.”</p><p>
  Ukyo flipped it up and pressed play. Rei sat quietly  as the color left Ukyo’s face.</p><p>
  “Oh my god.” Ukyo said as the video faded to black, a  faint echo in her thoughts of a voice telling her “I guard the door.” </p><p>
  For a long moment there was silence. Then “Why are you  telling me this?</p><p>
  “Because I know that you have a destiny. I know that  you would not be a part of Zhu Shu’s life if you could not be who she <em>needs</em> you to be.” She smiled. “Zhu Shu  has done more for my faith than all my years of training and devotion. She  showed me the truths of my own heart, and because of it, I am a better person  than I think I could have ever been.”</p><p>
  “So why don’t you go out with her?”</p><p>
  “I am. Our first date was the night she died. And we  have been lovers as well as friends. But I can’t keep her forever. I am a  Sailor Senshi, and my first duty lies with the Kingdom of the Moon.”</p><p>
  “Okay, that’s like the second or third time you’ve  mentioned that, what the heck are you talking about?”</p><p>
  “Ask Zhu Shu. She can tell you far faster than I can.”</p><p>
  “Umm, in case you haven’t noticed, she’s <em>not here</em> right now.”</p><p>
  “Of course she is. And you know it. She said you were  ignoring her, but you know it doesn’t make her go away.”</p><p>
  “Kami.” Ukyo sighed. She closed her eyes, and touched  the part of her mind she had tried to forget was there since Zhu Shu had fled  the shop. The emotional pain was like an open wound, but she ignored it. <em>&lt;&lt;Look, Rei’s here and she says I have  to ask you about the Moon Kingdom.&gt;&gt;</em> she thought at the link, not  bothering to mask her annoyance. For a long second, there was silence…</p><p>
  Then, she felt something touch her, like a butterfly  brushing the back of her head, and somehow, she suddenly knew <em>everything</em>. She reeled as everything she  had learned about the past shredded like paper in a storm and was replaced with  a much different history. </p><p>
  And then, as if triggered by the sudden knowledge,  from out of the depths of her subconscious came a memory of her own…</p>
<p>* * * * </p>
<p><em>He stood more  than a head taller than Lin Tzu, but there was no mistaking the resemblance.  But where she had never seen anything but love and kindness on her beloved’s  face, hatred made his a mask of rage.</em></p><p>
  <em>“Where is she,  Ukyo?”</em></p><p>
  <em>She spun her guan  dao, the weapon making a whine as it blurred before her. She knew she was dead,  but every second she could buy would give Lin Tzu  and her sister-wives just that much more of a  chance to escape.</em></p><p>
  <em>“Where you’ll  never find her, Xi’an Chi.” Her words were mocking. “Looks like you’re going to  have to stay Beryl’s lackey.”</em></p><p>
  <em>His eyes  blazed. “You were a fool to stay. Did you think I didn’t know about your curse?  That I didn’t know you are the father of her child?”</em></p><p>
  <em>Ukyo laughed.  “I think you are entirely unaware of many things, wizard. Not the least of  which is what I am cursed to be.” With a laugh, she slit the wine skin hidden  in the hangings above her.</em></p><p>
  <em>She had hidden  it for months, ashamed to show anyone, ashamed of her ugliness, but that didn’t  matter anymore. Just five more minutes, that’s all she had to buy, and Lin  would be safe. She looked down at the suddenly diminutive wizard, the ornate  bladed staff in her hand adjusting to her altered size. “As you can see wizard,  even cursed I am still a woman,” she growled past the tusks that jutted from  her lower jaw.</em></p><p>
  <em>The wizard  sneered. “An Oni. Do you really think that strength alone can match my magic?”  He raised his hand and fired a bolt of lightning at her.</em></p><p>
  <em>She laughed as  her glaive absorbed the bolt. “Oh, but I have far more than strength alone,”  she said as she raised the blade and called “NOW FEEL THE DRAGON’S WRATH!”</em></p><p>
  <em>Even the  wizard had to shield his eyes as the blade ignited into blue fire and her  cheongsam burned away, her mystical armor forming in the blink of an eye. “Do  your worst, wizard!  I am the Guardian of  the Dragon, AND YOU SHALL NOT HAVE HER!”</em></p><p>
  <em>Then there was  no time to think, only to act.</em></p><p>
  <em>The duel  shattered the remains of the imperial palace, dust and debris flying as he parried  her attacks with his staff, or as she dodged one of his spells. Her armor  rendered her immune to direct magical attack and every block drained more of  his energy. As the soldiers of the Moon fought and died alongside the still  loyal troops of the empire against the endless hordes of Queen Beryl and Xi’an  Chi’s rebels, they danced to a song of death.</em></p><p>
  <em>And then, he  was just a second too slow, and her guan dao ripped across his left eye, then  buried itself into his belly as he howled in pain.</em></p><p>
  <em>Ukyo gave a vicious  grin. “Gotcha, you bastard.” She twisted the shaft hard.</em></p><p>
  <em>Xi’an Chi  coughed up blood, but gave her an evil smile, one made even more hideous by the  ruin she had made of his face. “Do you think you’ve won?” He laughed weakly.  “You may have kept her from me this time, but I will find her eventually, and  where will you be to save her then?” He spat. “Just a forgotten trophy in my  throne room.”</em></p><p>
  <em>Ukyo screamed  as the spittle burned into her cheek, and she yanked the glaive out to begin a  swing to decapitate the wizard, but even as she did, she could feel herself  going numb. In horror she saw the color draining from her arm, replaced by the  smooth whiteness of marble.</em></p><p>
  <em>Then sight was  gone to the darkness of stone, and she relinquished herself to eternal night.</em></p><p>
  <em>But it was  okay. She’d bought the time they needed.</em></p><p>
  Farewell,  my darling Lin. And know I have always loved you…</p>
<p> * * * *</p>
<p>She found herself looking at the splintered remains of  the table they had been setting at, Rei hesitantly reaching out to her.</p><p>
  “Ukyo? Are you okay?”</p><p>
  Ukyo realized she was hyperventilating, and forced  herself to stop. She slowed her breathing and tried to get her heart to stop  trying to jump through her ribcage.</p><p>
  “Ukyo?”</p><p>
  “The bastard turned me into a statue!” she hissed.</p><p>
  “What? Ukyo, what happened?”</p><p>
  “<em>Xi’an Chi</em>!  The bastard turned me into a statue! I almost had him!” </p><p>
  And then she started shaking. “Oh gods, Rei. I  remember dying!” She tried to take another deep breath. “I-I tried asking Zhu  Shu like you told me, and I think she tried to tell me, at least, I suddenly  knew about the Moon Kingdom, and the war with Beryl and how you and the Senshi…  and then, from out of nowhere, I found myself remembering how I had died… but I  kept him from getting to her. I bought them the time to get away.”</p><p>
  “Who, Ukyo? What are you talking about?”</p><p>
  “Lin Tzu.”</p><p>
  Rei drew her breath in sharply. “You remember her  too?”</p><p>
  Ukyo nodded. “Yes. Not really much, but I remember I  was her wife, and I - I volunteered to stay behind to make sure she escaped…it  was my duty as The Dragon’s Guardian.” She paused, overwhelmed by a memory of  tiny little jade green eyes. “I made sure she could escape with our daughter…”</p><p>
  “Oh.” Rei said, her eyes bright with tears. “I wish I  remembered more of the past.  I have  spotty memories of Lin Tzu, but they are all before the war.  Of our relationship I have none at all.  But you just explained why I’ve had this  nagging feeling I’ve known you before.”</p><p>
  Ukyo raised an eyebrow. “Huh?”</p><p>
  “One of the longest memories I have of the past is of  a meeting with Lin Tzu and her Guardian one day.  You were older than you are now, but it was  definitely you.”</p><p>
  Ukyo looked at her. “How can you take this so calmly?”</p><p>
  Rei shrugged. “You think I wasn’t freaked out the  first time I got drawn into a fight against Beryl and her minions? My very  first encounter got me drawn into a pocket universe that we barely got out of,  but we prevailed, and now Beryl is gone for good. But it wasn’t without cost.  We <em>died</em> getting rid of her, and only  the power of the Ginzishou brought us back.”</p><p>
  Ukyo sighed. “I need a drink,” she said as she stood  and dug behind the counter, producing a bottle of sake. Rei gave her a raised  eyebrow as she poured a small glass, and shook her head when Ukyo held up the  bottle questioningly.</p><p>
  “We’re both underage, Ukyo. You shouldn’t be drinking  that either.”</p><p>
  “One glass isn’t enough to get me drunk, Rei. I just  need to calm down, and it is a relaxant.” She sat back down, “and you can’t  tell me you’ve never had any.”</p><p>
  “Well, just a little,” Rei admitted. “Look, I know  you’re probably very confused right now, but none of that is important.  I just wanted you to know about this because  I knew Zhu Shu hadn’t told you, and you needed to know.”</p><p>
  “Why?” Ukyo said glumly, looking into her cup.</p><p>
  Rei shrugged. “I guess because <em>I</em> needed you to know how far she is willing to go to help others,  and to try and make sure that you don’t hate her for trying to help, even if it  might not have been the <em>smartest</em> thing for her to do. Whatever you may think about the fact that she loves you,  she was sincerely only trying to save you from your father.”</p><p>
  “Why should that matter to you?</p><p>
  “Because I love her, Ukyo, and you have no idea how  much it hurts to see her in pain.”</p><p>
  “Then you marry her!”</p><p>
  “I can’t, Ukyo. In the end, my loyalty is to Usagi and  the Senshi. And I might die at any time fighting against threats that only the  Senshi can handle. We are the defenders of the Earth. I’ve already had to leave  her once because of duty, way back when. I can’t do that to her again. I’m  thankful I’ve had a chance to be her lover again, but I can’t be to her what  she needs.” She sighed. “The gods know I want to, but it’s impossible. I don’t  share the same bond with her that you do.   Our souls aren’t linked like she is with you!”</p><p>
  “I would give it to you in a heartbeat.” Ukyo snarled.  “Look, okay, I might have been a wife to her in a past life, <em>but that’s not who I am now!</em>”</p><p>
  “And I’m not saying you have to be.” Rei said quietly.  “But you can be her friend, and you can hopefully understand that all she was  trying to do was save you from having to be forced into marrying someone your  dad picked. All she cares about is <em>your</em> happiness. Surely you can feel that?”</p><p>
  Ukyo didn’t say anything, just kept staring into her  glass. Finally Rei sighed and stood. </p><p>
  “Alright, I guess I’ve said my piece. I don’t know  what else to say.”</p><p>
  Ukyo still didn’t say a word, so Rei sighed again as  she picked up her wand and reverted to her miko’s garb before she turned to go.</p><p>
  “Why did you admit to me that you were Mars?” Ukyo  asked right before she opened the door. “How did you know I wouldn’t run out  and tell everyone? You barely even know me.”</p><p>
  Rei nodded. “True, but you see, I too have looked into  the Eyes of the Dragon.”</p><p>
  Then she was gone.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>It was a long, uncomfortable night.</p><p>
  The morning wasn’t much better. Zhu Shu wasn’t walking  along the river when Ukyo checked, nor in her homeroom.</p><p>
  Akane and Shan Pu wouldn’t meet her eyes, the Amazon  just sniffing in disdain.  Ranma hadn’t  even shown up at school.</p><p>
  In the corridors between classes, she had felt like  the entire school had been looking at her in disapproval.  The Hentai squad had shaken their heads,  looking askance at her, wondering how anyone could find the cruelty to break  Zhu Shu’s heart.</p><p>
  At lunch she had the roof all to herself, the few  others who had been there leaving when she arrived.</p><p>
  Even her portable okonomiyaki grill refused to light.  She was about to toss it off the roof when a shadow fell across her.</p><p>
  “Not easy is it?” Ai asked as she sat down on the edge  of the roof, her long hair blowing softly in the wind.</p><p>
  “What?” Ukyo asked looking around for the rest of the  squad, but the head cheerleader was alone.</p><p>
  “Being the object of the jealousy of an entire school,  being hated.” She waved around the grounds. “There’s not a person in this  school, male or female, that doesn’t like Zhu Shu, including me. She’s still  got to pay for humiliating my squad, but it doesn’t mean I don’t <em>like</em> her. And here, she’s gone and  thrown herself at your feet, and the entire school hates you for it.  You’ve stolen the heart of their dream girl  and broken it.”</p><p>
  Ukyo shrugged. “I would have thought it was because  I’m pissed at her manipulating my dad into making her my fiancée.”</p><p>
  “No. Whether you know it or not, Ukyo, your dad is  lucky no-one here knew he was in Nerima, or he’d have had a challenge from just  about everyone in school over his idiotic vow over Ranma. We’re on <em>your</em> side there. You’re one of us, one  of the misfits. It’s our common bond.” She pointed with her head, “Out there, a  whole world goes by, doing it’s best to ignore us, the square pegs that don’t  fit in round holes, but we know it’s because they don’t understand us. Take my  parents for example. They just <em>love</em> my sister, Mariko. She’s their golden girl, but me?” She snorted. “I’m the prodigal  they wish would disappear. It never occurred to them that if maybe they had  paid more attention to me, instead of their work, or fought with each other  less, I would have never been so desperate for attention that I ended up  pregnant at fifteen.” She gave Ukyo a glare, “And if you ever tell anyone that,  I’ll kill you.”</p><p>
  Ukyo shook her head.</p><p>
  “Good, anyway, they never realized all I was looking  for was their love, and when I couldn’t get it, I tried finding substitutes. My  squad is pretty similar, we’re all rich pretty girls who got raised by nannies  and daddy’s wallet, instead of our parents. If we weren’t in the squad, we’d  probably all be in JuV now. But because I made mistakes, my parents started to  actually pay attention to Mariko, and she gets everything I wish they would have  given me.” She sighed again. “But we all still have our little niches, our  little safe havens from a world that is nothing but pain…”</p><p>
  “…And we have Zhu Shu.”</p><p>
  Ukyo blinked at Ai’s last comment. “Huh?”</p><p>
  “She’s the ultimate outsider, Ukyo. A mascot for the  rest of us. We care about her because she finds value in us all.  No matter how odd, or strange, or crazy we  may be to the rest of the world, she accepts us on our own terms.  She laughs at being chased by the Hentai  squad, she let the biology club examine her wings and tail, she’s posed for the  photo club, and even gave the chemistry club some of her scales for  analysis.  She makes us feel like we  matter.  Hell, the worst thing I can  think of that she’s called me is hentai girl, and I would think as her chief  adversary she’d be able to come up with a better insult than that, except that  I can’t help but think that deep down, she finds it impossible to hate me, and  is afraid to hurt my feelings, so as annoyed as I am that I haven’t found a way  to beat her, I can’t make myself hate her either.  She cares about <em>everyone</em> too much to ever do anything to hurt <em>anyone</em>.  And we can <em>all</em> feel that.  Somehow, she makes all of us feel a little  better about ourselves, a little happier with our lots in life, and because of  that, we hate to see her unhappy.”  </p><p>
  A long moment passed with only the sound of the wind.</p><p>
  “So I guess you’re trying to tell me I should just  give in and become a lesbian too?” Ukyo finally said.</p><p>
  Ai shook her head. “Believe it or not, no. That’s not  something anyone can force themselves to be. We don’t control whether we’re  straight or gay or bisexual, Ukyo. We’re born who we are. But one thing I know  all about is <em>denial.</em> I know how badly  we can lie to <em>ourselves</em> about what  our desires are because we have so many societal pressures to conform to what’s  accepted, to what’s <em>normal</em>. For me,  it took nearly dying due to a miscarriage to get me to look seriously at my  life, and if it hadn’t been for this cute little nurses aid who would come in  and talk to me every day while I was recovering, I don’t know that I <em>would</em> have recovered. The gods know, all  I wanted to do was die. But we talked, and I ended up telling her my whole  story, and eventually, I realized that I loved her. We dated for six months  after I got out of the hospital, until she had to move to Germany with her  family, but she taught me what it felt like to simply be <em>accepted</em> instead of <em>condemned.</em>”</p><p>
  She looked down at Ukyo, “My point is, I had told  myself so many times that my desires for females were perverted until it had  simply become a habit, one that, had I not met her, and found in her the  courage to overcome my inhibitions, I might have never beaten. I would have  probably spent the rest of my life going from one bad relationship to the next  looking solely for the most idiotically testosterone overloaded guys I could  find in an effort to prove I wasn’t really attracted to girls as well. I’ve  finally accepted that I <em>prefer</em> women,  but I like guys almost as much. While I’m not looking for a serious  relationship right now, I know that when I am, it isn’t really going matter  whether it’s a guy or a girl, so long as I know <em>they</em> love <em>me</em>.” </p><p>
  She stood. “I’m not saying that just because Zhu Shu  loves you, you have to return her love, but don’t throw it away because of what  society may or may not approve of, or because you’re rebelling against your  dad. Your only criteria has to be whether or not it makes <em>you</em> happy. You have to make a choice for yourself, regardless of  what any of <em>them</em> say or do.  You have to look at yourself in the mirror of  your soul, without any care about what anyone else thinks, and decide what is  right for you.  Otherwise <em>you’re</em> going to be the one suffering,  and you will be doing it to <em>yourself</em>.”</p><p>
  As Ai turned to leave Ukyo had to ask. “So why, out of  everybody in this school, are you the only one who came to talk to me?”</p><p>
  Ai gave her a smile. “Because under the bleach, the  short skirt and the pom-poms, I am a warrior, and I know how hard it is to be  born with a heart of steel.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The day passed, and Ukyo was glad that school was  finally over. But she wasn’t ready to go home. Instead she headed to the train  station. </p><p>
  Trains had always helped her think. She bought a  ticket on the longest circle track and settled into a seat, popping on her  headphones. Setting the iPod to random and the volume to low, she tuned out and  watched the scenery go by.</p><p>
  Was she wrong to be upset? </p><p>
  In a way, yes. Zhu Shu really hadn’t meant any harm.  Even Ukyo had to admit that Rei was right and Zhu Shu had only been trying to  save her from her dad. And she agreed with Lo Shen that Zhu Shu would never  stand in the way of her finding a boyfriend, even if they <em>were</em> married.  It would be a  marriage in name only.  </p><p>
  But Zhu Shu had also known that Ukyo wasn’t happy  about her dad trying to engage her to <em>any</em> girl. Just because he was a stubborn ass about his vow…</p><p>
  But really, hadn’t <em>she</em> been just as stubborn in her ten year quest to force Ranma to marry her? She’d  been dead set on marrying him regardless of whatever he might have thought,  sure she would make him love her in time. She had been certain that she would  find some way to <em>make</em> him love her,  no matter what.  She certainly had to  admit she didn’t have the moral high ground there.  She’d been as willing to be as sneaky and  underhanded about getting her way as she had accused Zhu Shu of being.</p><p>
  And what of his curse? She’d been willing enough to  accept <em>him</em> being a girl part time in  regards to marrying him, for the all of five minutes of hope she’d entertained  before his mother destroyed it forever. Why <em>really</em> did she object to a full time girl so hard? Because she really didn’t like  girls, or because she was rebelling against her fathers insistence on treating  her like a boy, as Ai had suggested?  She  had certainly had many girls trying to date her, and even been really close  friends with a couple, yet she had always been obsessed with  Ranma.   Could she really say she had ever truly considered anything else?  Hell, if she was honest with herself, she had  still hoped that somehow she could have found a way to marry Ranma, and she  couldn’t say that his being a girl half the time had affected that in the  least.  She’d found the curse  fascinating, and had had to fight the urge to pour hot and cold water on him to  make him change back and forth on several occasions.</p><p>
  She sighed.  And  what about her friendship with him?  He’d  really been going out of his way to renew the friendship between them, and she  had to admit that she had liked it.  But  it was just as obvious that she’d upset him as badly as she had Zhu Shu. She  was afraid the reason he had not come to school today was to avoid seeing  her.  As chilly as the looks Shan Pu and  Akane had given her were, she dreaded facing him.  She had to work this out with Zhu Shu  somehow, or she risked losing all the friendships she had started to find here  in Nerima…</p><p>
  Gods! How, <em>really</em>,  did she feel about Zhu Shu?  If she  didn’t know that the dragon girl was in love with her, how <em>would</em> she feel? </p><p>
  She mulled that over for a long while, and finally had  to admit that she’d come to value Zhu Shu’s friendship too.  In the short time since the dragon girl had  come to work for her, she had settled into the same easy relationship she would  have had with anyone she had known for years.   She couldn’t even visualize running the shop without her. Their little  game during work hours passed the time so quickly, and had made her look  forward to running the shop every day after school.  She’d brought something into Ukyo’s life that  she couldn’t put a finger on, but that she knew she would find hard to live  without.  </p><p>
  Her mind went back to the memories she had found  yesterday, and she thought about how she had felt during those moments… a  warrior at peace with dying, with giving her life in the defense of the one who  meant more to her than life itself… </p><p>
  “Beware the love of a dragon…” she murmured to  herself.  “For only the strong survive.”</p><p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;Yet one dragon loved shall never  die.&gt;&gt; </em></p><p>
  She looked around, almost certain she had heard a  familiar voice but the car was filled with only strange faces.  She shook her head and dismissed the random  thought, then dug into her book bag and took out a notepad and her pencil.  She held them as she tried to think of a way  to put her thoughts down in a way that might help her sort them out.  It would be so much easier if she didn’t feel  like she was being pressured from every side to fall for the dragon girl.  Lo Shen, Rei, Ranma and his fiancées, And now  even her father.  She felt  railroaded.   </p><p>
  She looked up as a pretty dark haired girl flounced  into the seat beside her, muttering loud enough to be heard over her earbuds  and interrupted her thoughts.</p><p>
  “I swear that knucklehead is going to go too far one  day and I’m going to make him sit in a river until he drowns!”</p><p>
  She quirked an eyebrow. “Relationship not going  smoothly?”</p><p>
  The girl looked up. “Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t realize I  said that out loud.”</p><p>
  Ukyo pulled the buds out. “No biggie, sugar. My  thoughts are just going in circles anyway.”</p><p>
  “I know how <em>that</em> feels.” The other girl said sympathetically. “Sometimes I think he annoys me  just to see if I’ll come back.”</p><p>
  “So why do you?”</p><p>
  The girl shrugged. “Because as much of a jerk as he  can be, I also see that deep down, he’s probably the noblest man I’ve ever  met.” She blushed. “Not that I’d ever tell him that. He’d laugh at me.”</p><p>
  “Doesn’t sound noble to me.” Ukyo tilted her head.</p><p>
  “But he is! I mean, he’s just had such a rough life.  He’s such a sweetheart, but nobody ever gave him a chance when he was growing  up. He just doesn’t know how to act because he’s never been allowed to learn.”  The girl sighed. “He looks a little different, because he’s only half- … well  half Japanese anyway. He was always picked on and his parents both died young.  He’s just always been alone.”</p><p>
  Ukyo nodded. “I can sympathize with that. I’ve had my  own share of being alone, and being teased. Children can be so cruel without  realizing it.”</p><p>
  The girl nodded, “Exactly, so he’s a little rough  around the edges, but that’s just one of the small things.” She sighed. “I just  wish I could be certain he loved me, is all.”</p><p>
  “I see.” Ukyo leaned back. “So what does he do to make  you wonder?”</p><p>
  The girl sighed. “It’s complicated.”</p><p>
  Ukyo laughed. “Trust me, I know complicated.”</p><p>
  “Well, before we met, there was another girl that he  was in love with.”</p><p>
  “Umhumm?”</p><p>
  “Well, they sort of had a breakup, but it wasn’t  because they didn’t love each other anymore. It was, well, because another  person kinda made each of them think the other had betrayed them, and they had  a really bad argument and, well, like wanted to kill each other. And now they  found out that it was this other person who had caused everything. I know he  still loves her, but she’s still cold to him. And I <em>think</em> he loves me, but every time Kikyou shows up, he’s still all  gaga over her.  But I <em>know</em> I love him, and even though it  hurts so much to see him act like that, I just want to be with him.”</p><p>
  Ukyo whistled. “That is tough.” She shook her head.  “I’m kinda on the opposite end of the spectrum. I know they love me. I just  don’t know if I can love them.”</p><p>
  “Why?”</p><p>
  “Well…” Ukyo sighed. “I…um… I have a small problem  with how they look.” She ended up lamely. “It’s complicated.” she added  ruefully.</p><p>
  The girl gave her sympathetic expression. “I have this  friend, named Jinenji. He’s the kindest, most caring person I’ve ever met, and  the ugliest. I was terrified of him the very first time I saw him, but I saw  right away that he meant me no harm, and soon, I discovered how wonderful a  person he was. He spends his time growing medicinal herbs and taking care of  his frail old mother. But the people in his town were just as scared of him as  I was at first, and they wanted to make him move. They even accused him of a  couple of crimes, until he caught the real criminal and they saw how good  hearted he really was. The last time I saw him, the children were using him as  a jungle gym.” Her eyes grew far away, “and my boyfriend, I have to admit,  before I got to know him, he was scary too.” She gave Ukyo a warm smile. “I  guess what I’m trying to say is that looks aren’t everything. I think I’d take  the certainty of love any day.” She looked up. “Oh, my stops up next.”</p><p>
  “Okay. Hey, I don’t even know your name, I’m Ukyo,  Ukyo Kuonji.”</p><p>
  “Kagome Higurashi. Nice to meet you, and good luck.”</p><p>
  “You too.”</p><p>
  She settled back into her seat and replaced her  earbuds. It was nice to know that even people with nice sane lives could  sympathize with the nuthouse existence of hers.   She started to put the pad back when she realized she’d drawn something  on it, and blinked.</p><p>
  She’d never been a good artist, but the sketch of the  bladed staff she had born in her memories was nearly perfect. She shook her  head in disbelief before tucking it into her bag.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>It had been a whim that made her get off the train  when she had seen the park.  The cherry  trees in bloom had just been so inviting, and the landscaping had provided many  isolated trails that had been perfect for the solitude she wanted.  She had wandered through the falling petals  aimlessly, inhaling the rich scent and letting her feet carry her deeper into  the stillness under the trees.  Even the  noise of the city around her had faded and left her in peace and quiet.</p><p>
  Then she found the small lake in the heart of the  park, and realized she had once frequented this place in her younger days.  It had been six or seven years previous, but  she had once come here to train every day when she had attended a nearby boys  elementary.  It had been one place most  of the boys wouldn’t go, simply because the park was considered a “make out”  spot.  She smiled as she thought about  how she had once fantasized about Ranma walking arm and arm with her under the  trees.</p><p>
  There was a small field to the side of the lake, and  her hands twitched as she visualized her younger self practicing her kata, the  spatula awkward in her small hands. She reached over her shoulder as she  entered the field, swinging the heavy weapon easily as she took up a stance.</p><p>
  But there was something not quite right about the  weapon.  The balance felt wrong, and the  handle unwieldy.  She felt like she was  that little kid again as she made mistake after mistake.  Her patterns and rhythms refused to flow, and  she finally gave up in frustration.  She  flopped down on a log overlooking the lake and sighed.</p><p>
  It was a sign of how badly out of center she was, she  knew.  It wasn’t the first time she had  felt like everything was wrong.  The  spatula had always been her family’s preferred weapon, used both in cooking as  well as combat, but all her life there had been times where the weapon had just  suddenly seemed clumsy and graceless.   Time and again during her training, her father had given her the speech  about the importance of maintaining the Kuonji school traditions, until she had  finally become a master with the weapon solely to shut him up.</p><p>
  She laid the spatula across her lap as she crossed her  legs and got comfortable on the log, closing her eyes as she sought to quiet  her thoughts and seek her center, visualizing the steps of her kata as her  hands rested on the cool metal.</p><p>
  But the vision of herself from her memories kept  intruding, and she found herself time and again seeing herself clothed in the  armor her other self had worn, bearing the bladed staff…</p><p>
  She sighed again as she finally gave up trying to  meditate and turned to lie on the log and stare at the slowly darkening  sky.  She wished she had an easy answer,  an absolute answer to everything, but there wasn’t one.  She had always believed in reincarnation, and  that she had once been someone else, so the fact that she had regained memories  of that other life wasn’t what had jarred her so badly, but those memories had  carried so much more than just a sequence of events.  They had held the essence of the one thing  she had spent ten years hoping for…</p><p>
  Absolute, unconditional love.  The kind of love that she had always dreamed  of with Ranma.  A love so strong not even  death could dim it.</p><p>
  And it had been for another <em>woman</em>.  </p><p>
  For the <em>same</em> woman who’s soul had returned in the body of a small Chinese girl who was lying  in her bedroom at this moment staring at her ceiling in a blur of tears,  convinced that she had made Ukyo hate her.  </p><p>
  Ukyo stared at the first early stars and cried.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>By the time she finally got home and turned in she was  still trying to figure out what to do about the engagement, but she had realized  she wasn’t really mad at Zhu Shu. She showered and lay in her bed, feeling the  link in her head.  The other girl wasn’t  crying any more, but the aura of her depression still colored the strand  heavily.</p><p>
  <em>What has been done cannot be undone</em>, Lo Shen had said, and of that she had no doubt.  Her father had accepted the dowry, and she  knew better than to expect him to back out of a formal betrothal.  She was going to be married to Zhu Shu,  regardless of what she might desire.   She’d learned the hard way how good his lawyers were.  He wasn’t going to give her a chance to  escape.  Even if she refused and was  disinherited, she had no doubt that he’d find some way to ensure she regretted  it forever.  Any way she looked at it,  she was officially Zhu Shu’s fiancée.   Whatever might come after didn’t matter.   She would be with Zhu Shu for the rest of her life…</p><p>
  And Zhu Shu was utterly miserable right now.  It was too late to call the Tendo’s and much  too late to visit, but she couldn’t let Zhu Shu spend another night thinking  she hated her.</p><p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;Zhu Shu.&gt;&gt;</em> she thought at the link in her head. <em>&lt;&lt;I don’t know if you can hear me or  not, but I hope at least the feeling gets through. I’m sorry I got so mad. I  know you were just wanting to help, and I know I was just too upset to see it.  I… I don’t know what to do about your feelings for me, but I can at least  accept that they’re real.&gt;&gt;</em></p><p>
  The little butterfly was at the back of her mind, and  it felt hesitant, like it was unsure it was welcome.</p><p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;Is that you Zhu Shu?&gt;&gt;</em></p><p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;Yes?&gt;&gt;</em></p><p>
  And then, around her, there was the smell of sakura,  and she found herself standing in front of the little dragon girl surrounded by  a twilit grove. Zhu Shu looked horrible, and Ukyo felt the stab of guilt in her  stomach. She reached out and wiped away a tear.</p><p>
  “Look, I’m sorry I yelled at you.”</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu sorry she hurt Ukyo.”</p><p>
  Ukyo nodded and looked around. Spying a stone bench  not far away, in front of an arch into nothingness, she sat down and patted the  stone beside her. </p><p>
  “I know you love me, Zhu Shu,” Ukyo began as the  dragon girl took her seat. “And I know you mean well, but I don’t know what to  think. When I met you, I <em>did</em> see  something, a rush of images I can’t explain, and don’t really remember, but I  knew what you wanted of me, what you wanted me to be. I’m sorry I got scared.”</p><p>
  “Is Zhu Shu should be sorry. Tried force Ukyo feel  same as Zhu Shu.”</p><p>
  “You did move a little fast, sugar. But again, I can  forgive you for it, knowing how you feel. And you didn’t do anything to me I  wasn’t guilty of trying to do to Ranma.” Ukyo sighed. “I guess the best way I  can put this is give me time. I had a memory yesterday that showed me that I <em>can</em> love you, I just can’t promise that  I <em>will</em> love you. Please, be patient.”</p><p>
  The little Chinese girl nodded, and Ukyo gathered her  in for a hug.</p><p>
  Then something caught her eye, and she looked up to  see a mirror propped against one of the cherry trees. It hadn’t been visible  from where they had arrived in the grove, but it reflected the two of them  quite well.</p><p>
  And Ukyo realized where they were… in a shared space  in their minds, a common dreamscape, and she was once again seeing a reflection  of her soul.</p><p>
  But it was Zhu Shu who drew her eye.</p><p>
  Ukyo could only stare in wonder. The mirror showed Zhu  Shu’s cursed form, not her normal body, but that wasn’t what made her heart  lump in her throat or her face feel flushed, it was how it had been changed…</p><p>
  Where Zhu Shu’s hair was midnight black, the one in the mirror seemed to have been  spun from the purest strands of silver, frosted with flecks of diamond. Her  horns were slightly longer and were a polished gold, but even that paled beside  her wings. The fine, nearly invisible scales that covered the arm part of her  wing had also changed from black, to a silver nearly pearlescent in its shine,  matching the translucent mother of pearl of the webbing. Like a dusting of  glitter, small sparkles twinkled on those wings, and down the center of her  back to her tail, accenting and highlighting her tattoo dramatically and Ukyo  noted with a start that the spatula on Zhu Shu’s back had been replaced with an  image of the weapon she had used in her memories.</p><p>
  And Zhu Shu glowed, a clear radiant light that seemed  to shine from deep within her, a light that Ukyo saw she shared as well. </p><p>
  She pulled away slightly and lifted Zhu Shu’s chin to  look into her eyes, noting that once again they had turned to bottomless pools  of liquid gold.</p><p>
  “Whatever we may end up as in this lifetime, you  should know that I loved you in our last one. I remember Lin Tzu, and I  remember giving my life for you.  Xi’an  Chi may have turned me into stone, but I fought him to my last breath, and my  dying thought was of you.”</p><p>
  And then she felt herself falling into those glorious  golden depths and for just a moment before sleep claimed her, she felt herself  wrapped by warm arms and delicate platinum wings…</p>
