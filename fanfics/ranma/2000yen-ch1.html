------------------------------------------------

     Ranma climbed the stairs to her room sullenly.  &lt;Why does
this always happen to me?&gt; she asked herself, opening the door
and going in.  Not only did the old man try and kill her, but
Akane, too, after she told her to try her own cooking.  &lt;Like
it&#39;s my fault she can&#39;t cook.&gt;

     Sighing, Ranma pulled off her shirt and laid down on her
futon.  The evening was too warm to even consider taking a hot
bath to change back into her boy-form.  Like she would have a
chance of getting past Akane with that sword of hers...  Sighing,
Ranma reached for one of the washrags she kept in a bowl of cold
water next to her bed these days.  The summer was so hot in
Furinkan that she always needed these cool rags at the end of a
day.  Not like in China; the summers there were at least
tolerable.  &lt;If you stay away from the Cursed Springs, that is,&gt;
Ranma thought &lt;Huh?&gt;

     Ranma looked at her nipples with surprise; they were
tingling from the contact with the cool water.  She smiled
faintly and put the cloth back in the bowl.  &lt;Haven&#39;t done this
to myself in a long time,&gt; she thought as she started to caress
her breasts &lt;I oughtta be safe; the old man&#39;s going to stay
downstairs all night, playing shogi with Mr. Tendo...&gt;  Closing
her eyes, Ranma reveled in the sensation as her touch upon her
breasts caused her insides to start that slow, churning
feeling...

     &lt;Mmm... it&#39;s not enough,&gt; she decided &lt;I might as well go
all the way.&gt;  Ranma untied her waistband and kicked off her
pants, then pulled off her undershorts as well.  Sighing, she
picked up one of the washrags again, and started rubbing the
coolness across her stomach and legs.  As she gently caressed her
inner thighs, she felt the sensations within her quicken.  She
let her head roll back as the drawing inside of her started to
pull...  Dropping the washcloth back in the bowl, she sat on her
heels and started to play with her breasts in earnest.  Softly,
she moaned as her heartbeat duplicated itself between her loins.
She reached down and placed her first two fingers between the
folds of flesh and began to tease her wetness around her
femininity.

     &gt;&gt;KLACK!&lt;&lt;

     Ranma&#39;s eyes flew open as she heard the door close.
&quot;A-Akane!&quot; she said, startled.  She&#39;d been so distracted that she
hadn&#39;t even heard...  Suddenly, Ranma blushed and looked away.
To be caught doing this by anyone, even by her kawaiikune
iinazuke...!

     &quot;Ranma,&quot; she heard Akane say softly, after a pause &quot;Do you
do this often?&quot;

     &quot;No.&quot; she answered miserably.

     Akane smiled softly.  &quot;Then you must be the only girl in
this house who doesn&#39;t.&quot; she said.

     &quot;What?!&quot; Ranma said, looking back at her as she knelt down
on the floor.

     &quot;We all do this to ourselves, Kasumi, Nabiki, and I,&quot; Akane
said, smiling &quot;We talk about it sometimes, when you men aren&#39;t
around.&quot;

     &quot;Talk about it?&quot; Ranma asked &quot;What do you talk about?&quot;

     &quot;We talk about our fantasies, mostly, and compare notes.&quot;
Akane said.

     &quot;Fantasies?  You... fantasize?&quot; Ranma asked, curious &quot;About
who?&quot;

     &quot;Oh, Kasumi mostly about Tofu-sensei,&quot; Akane answered
&quot;Nabiki about some of the guys in her magazines, sometimes some
of the guys in her class.&quot;

     &quot;And you?&quot; Ranma felt compelled to ask.

     &quot;... I fantasize about you.&quot; Akane answered quietly, looking
away.

     &quot;About... me?&quot; Ranma asked.  Akane nodded.  &quot;About me as a
boy or a girl?&quot;

     &quot;... Both,&quot; Akane answered, blushing &quot;And sometimes about
both at once.&quot;

     &quot;...&quot; Ranma replied, looking away.

     &quot;Next time make sure your door&#39;s shut all the way, Ranma,&quot;
Akane said, getting up &quot;It might not be me next time.&quot;

     &quot;Akane...&quot; Ranma said.

	&quot;Yes?&quot; she asked, pausing at the doorway.

	&quot;I&#39;m sorry I said what I did about your cooking,&quot; Ranma said
&quot;It really isn&#39;t your fault that you don&#39;t know how to cook.&quot;

	&quot;Ranma...&quot; Akane said softly, turning to face her.  She
walked back to where Ranma-chan was sitting and kneeled down.
&quot;Thank you.&quot;

	&quot;Akane...&quot; Ranma said, watching the tender look on Akane&#39;s
face, something that she rarely had an opportunity to do.  It
seemed like they were always fighting...

	Suddenly, Akane pulled her blouse over her head.  As it
dropped on the floor next to her, she unfastened her bra and laid
it on top of the blouse.  She looked at Ranma with a seriousness
in her eyes that she ususually only got when she was fighting.
&quot;You don&#39;t think it&#39;s sick, do you, wanting to be with another
girl?&quot; she asked.

	&quot;I&#39;m a boy,&quot; was Ranma&#39;s automatic response, but she caught
it halfway.  She considered the question, picturing making love
to Akane as a girl, and slowly shook her head.  &quot;No, I don&#39;t
think that it&#39;s sick at all.&quot;

	&quot;Then... would you...&quot; Akane said, unsure of how to phrase
the ending.

	&quot;Yes,&quot; Ranma said simply.  She reached for another washcloth
as Akane stood and stepped out of her skirt and panties.  As
Akane sat back down again, completely naked, Ranma gently started
to rub it over her breast.  &quot;You really do have nice breasts,&quot;
she said &quot;They&#39;re not as big as mine, but they&#39;re nice.&quot;

	&quot;Ranma...&quot; Akane said through gritted teeth.  Suddenly she
thought of the right way to get back at Ranma.

	She kissed her.

	&quot;A-Akane!&quot; Ranma said, shocked, as Akane drew back.

	&quot;I think that neither of us know how to kiss very well.&quot;
Akane said, sounding rueful.

	&quot;... Want to try to teach ourselves?&quot; Ranma asked, thinking
of a way to one-up Akane.

	Akane looked at her, startled.  &lt;She doesn&#39;t think that I&#39;ll
call her bluff,&gt; she thought &lt;So I will.&gt;  &quot;Okay.&quot; she said.

	They closed their eyes as they leaned together, meeting in
the middle.  Their lips met each other, and they kissed.  &lt;Damn,
no fireworks!&gt; Ranma thought &lt;I wanted to blow her toes off!&gt;

	&lt;... It&#39;s missing something,&gt; Akane thought &lt;It needs...
more.&gt;

	&lt;N-Nani?!&gt; Ranma thought as Akane opened her mouth wider
against hers and gently put her tongue into Ranma&#39;s mouth.
&lt;Well, two can play at that game!&gt;

	Akane would have smiled, were she not so busy teaching Ranma
to French kiss, as Ranma put her tongue in her mouth.  They
gently sucked on each other&#39;s tongues for a little while, until
Ranma gently started to caress Akane&#39;s breasts.  &lt;Mmm... that&#39;s
nice,&gt; Akane thought from behind her closed eyes &lt;I wonder if I
should...&gt;

	Ranma opened her eyes, startled for a second, as Akane
raised her hands to her breasts, and started to tease at the
nipples.  &lt;She&#39;s good at this!&gt; Ranma thought, closing her eyes
again as her breasts started to tingle, and the sensations below
kicked back in, teasing, taunting with pleasure.  &lt;I&#39;m going to
be so wet by the time we get around to finishing this.&gt; she
thought, feeling the juices flowing from her body again.  Slowly,
she lowered one of her hands between Akane&#39;s legs.

	Akane slid her legs apart as Ranma&#39;s hand rested for a
second upon her mound.  &lt;Oh, yes...&gt; she thought as Ranma touched
her core.  This was one of her fantasies, and she was living it
out.  How many women got to do that?  It was so good, even
better than it had been when it was just a fantasy and she was
touching herself...  

	As Ranma began to stroke her, Akane softly moaned.  It felt
like fire, like burning lava pouring through her body.  It kept
building.  She needed to do something...  Restlessly, she dropped
her own hand between Ranma&#39;s legs and felt her wetness, her
readiness, as she began to tease at Ranma&#39;s femininity.

	&quot;Ah... Ah...&quot; Ranma moaned, breaking their intertwined kiss
in order to breathe.  Akane was good at doing this; her touch
burned upon Ranma, building her higher.  She&#39;d never been this
wet before, never been this ready.  As Akane stroked her, she
moved her own finger upon Akane more furiously, in turn.

	&quot;Oh, God...&quot; Akane moaned, as she felt the fire build high,
higher than she&#39;d ever gone before.  She was nearly there
already...

	&lt;I can&#39;t take much more...&gt; Ranma thought as the passion
threatened to swallow her.  Only by concentrating upon her
fingers, still moving in Akane&#39;s cleft, was she able to keep it
at bay...

	&lt;No more...&gt; Akane thought, desparate, needing release.

	&lt;No more...&gt; Ranma thought, fighting the pleasure, needing
it to stop.

	&lt;Please...!&gt; thought Akane.

	&quot;Ah...!  Ah!  AH!!!&quot; they cried out together they both
reached their climaxes, and the world around them went black.

	&quot;Akane...&quot; Ranma whispered, a few minutes later.

	&quot;Ranma...&quot; Akane whispered back.

	&quot;You know, you really are a kawaiikune tomboy...&quot; Ranma said
&quot;But you&#39;re MY kawaiikune tomboy.&quot;

	&quot;You&#39;re an idiot, Ranma,&quot; Akane replied &quot;But you&#39;re MY
idiot, and that makes it different.&quot;

	&quot;Akane...  I like you.&quot;

	&quot;I like you, too, Ranma.&quot; Akane said as they laid down on
the futon together.  Slowly, their wet hands met each other, and
they were silent.





	Outside the door to Ranma and Genma&#39;s room, Nabiki and
Kasumi sat quietly, listening.  As they heard Ranma and Akane cry
out their pleasure, they both smiled, and got up, heading
downstairs into the kitchen.

	&quot;That&#39;s two thousand yen you owe me, Kasumi.&quot; Nabiki said,
helping herself to a cookie.

	&quot;Getting those two together was well worth it,&quot; Kasumi said,
handing Nabiki the money &quot;Though I admit, I didn&#39;t think that you
could do it.&quot;

	&quot;Hey, I can do anything if you give me a monetary
incentive.&quot; Nabiki said as she left.

	&lt;Little sister,&gt; Kasumi thought as she picked up a knife and
prepared to make dinner &lt;I wonder if you know how easy to
manipulate you really are?  All I had to do was bet you couldn&#39;t,
and you immediately decided to get Ranma and Akane together.  And
for only two thousand yen!&gt;




Author&#39;s Note: Okay, disclaimer first: obviously, the characters
	and situations in this fanfic are shamelessly stolen from
	Rumiko Takahashi, and for me to even try to claim otherwise
	would be ridiculous.  That said, I hope that I didn&#39;t stray
	too far from the &quot;feel&quot; of Ranma 1/2, and that you enjoyed
	reading it.  Comments, constructive criticism, and
	corrections are welcome at ranmafan@cats.ucsc.edu, though
	flames will be ignored.  This was my first effort at writing
	a fan-fic, and I hope that I can learn from your feedback.
	Mata ne!
