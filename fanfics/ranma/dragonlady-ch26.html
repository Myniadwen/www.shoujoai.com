The monitor on Breetai&#39;s flagship currently displayed two beautiful 
Micronian females singing a song they called &#39;The Power of Love&#39;.

&quot;Those females...their voices have the power to make a man feel sadness 
and...longing,&quot; Breetai said to Exedore.

&quot;Indeed, Mi&#39;lord,&quot; Exedore said. &quot;Their ability to make us feel emotion 
is a very powerful weapon and is likely the exact reason the archives 
warned us to avoid contact with them. We have no defense against it.&quot;

&quot;Lord Breetai,&quot; the messenger&#39;s face popped up on the monitor, 
interrupting the broadcast of Ranma and Minmei singing. &quot;Forgive the 
interruption but I have orders from Lord Dolza. He had ordered a full 
scale assault on the Space Fortress and that the Micronian ship be 
completely destroyed. There are to be no survivors.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Breetai said as the monitor returned to the broadcast of 
the wedding reception. &quot;So Exedore, I fear the moment has finally come 
when we must end this. I do not look forward to what I must do. I don&#39;t 
know why, but I will not take any satisfaction in the destruction of the 
Micronians. I regret what I must do. Order the attack.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Mi&#39;lord,&quot; Exedore acknowledged.

(oO\O/Oo)

As the Zentradi forces closed in for the attack, General Quarters was 
sounded throughout the SDF-1. The festiveness and joy of the reception 
was instantly replaced with a grim, all-business atmosphere as Gloval 
ordered everyone to battle stations.

&quot;Hey Max,&quot; Ranma called as she made her way to the door, &quot;you can sit 
this one out. We can get by without you for one battle.&quot;

&quot;No way, Mom,&quot; Max said. &quot;I can&#39;t let my comrades go out there without 
me. I&#39;m sorry Miriya, but I have to go.&quot; He began pulling off his tie.

&quot;I&#39;ll go with you, Max,&quot; Miriya said.

&quot;But you can&#39;t,&quot; Max protested.

&quot;I can pilot your Robotech mecha just as well as any of you,&quot; Miriya 
disagreed. &quot;When they did the tests on me they even check my neural link 
ability and found the I am qualified to be a member of Wild Rose. Ranma 
even got me my own helmet and flight suit. My place is by your side, 
Max. Even in battle. I won&#39;t let you go without me.&quot;

&quot;Well, I guess I can&#39;t stop you then,&quot; Max smiled tenderly at her. &quot;I&#39;d 
be honored to have you fight by my side.&quot;

&quot;Then lets go, Max,&quot; Miriya returned his smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll be right beside 
you.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma and Akane had just launched off the waist cats and were forming up 
with the rest of Wild Rose to head into battle when Ranma heard 
something surprising on the Tac-Net.

&quot;Pilot Max Sterling, Wild Rose 3, prepared for launch,&quot; Max&#39;s voice 
said. Ranma was about to chastise him when the next voice came over the 
radio.

&quot;Pilot Miriya Pa...Sterling, Wild Rose Four, ready for launch,&quot; Miriya&#39;s 
voice said.

Ranma groaned. She was going to catch hell for this, she just knew it. 
She almost wished that she hadn&#39;t gotten Miriya the neural helmet and 
flight suit in anticipation of her being approved to fly. Still, she 
could understand Miriya wanting to go into combat with her new husband. 
That&#39;s why she told Max to stay put.

&quot;Wild Rose 3 and 4,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;As soon as you&#39;re launched join on me 
and Fury. You know I&#39;m gonna be in deep fecal matter because of this, 
don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Sorry, Mom,&quot; Max said sheepishly as he and Miriya pulled into echelon 
formation with Ranma and Akane, who were both flying with the new 
armored Veritech package. &quot;I couldn&#39;t just let my flight-mates go into 
battle without me, could I?&quot;

&quot;Well, yeah, you could have,&quot; Ranma responded. &quot;Fury and I have more 
than enough fire power to make up for the rest of the flight. It doesn&#39;t 
matter now though since you&#39;re here.&quot;

&quot;Mom?&quot; Miriya asked, the grin in her voice could be heard as she used 
Ranma&#39;s squadron call sign. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, okay? I won&#39;t let you or Max 
down. There is something I&#39;d like to suggest though.&quot;

&quot;What might that be?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;If we truly want peace, then it&#39;s time for the talking to stop and the 
action to speak for itself,&quot; Miriya said. &quot;If you target the battle pods 
between where the legs meet the torso, you will destroy their primary 
power coupling and render them disabled without killing the pilots.&quot;

&quot;Four, that&#39;s a good idea,&quot; Ranma said, &quot;but I can&#39;t order everyone to 
do that. Not everyone is good enough to take the time to maneuver for 
that shot. Wild Rose can do it and I will advise everyone else that this 
is the preferred shot to take, but I can&#39;t order my people to take those 
kinds of risks. Please understand.&quot;

&quot;I understand, Mom,&quot; Miriya said. &quot;But it will still make a difference 
if just the pilots that are good enough to do it without risk, did so.&quot;

&quot;Hey DL, I heard what she said and Skull will try for the disabling 
shot,&quot; Rick said. Several other Squadron leaders chimed in with their 
agreement as well.

&quot;Okay, people,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I&#39;m very proud of you all. Just remember, 
don&#39;t take any unnecessary risks and get yourselves killed. Wild Rose 4, 
are there any disabling points on the fighters?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Miriya said sadly.

&quot;Okay, well, all Veritech groups, listen up,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Target only 
the fighters with your missiles. Take the pods out with cannon and 
lasers and try for the disabling shots if you can.&quot;

Five seconds later the battle was joined. Ranma and Akane used their 
augmented systems to target the fighter with their heavy missile payload 
while using their heavy beam cannon to disable the battle pods. Max and 
Miriya danced though the pods leaving them adrift, but intact, in their 
wake. The pair seemed to be made for each other as they worked as an 
amazingly synchronized team. Miriya proved to be every bit as good as 
Max, matching him move for move.

The two of them caused nearly as much damage and Ranma and Akane did, 
actually working better as a team in spite of Ranma and Akane having 
flown together for a lot longer. While on an individual basis, Wild Rose 
1 and 2 were both better than 3 and 4, only the augmentation on their 
Veritechs allowed them to make a bigger impact than Max and his wife&#39;s 
perfect coordination.

(oO\O/Oo)

Aboard Breetai&#39;s fleet, another drama was unfolding. Many of Beetai&#39;s 
best pilots were refusing to fight. They would not fire on their friends 
aboard the SDF-1 and were quite adamant about this fact. There were more 
than a few incidents where the point was made with the muzzle of a gun.

Breetai, recognizing what was happening and where it would lead, ordered 
the withdrawal of his troops to begin planning for what he suspected was 
coming.

(oO\O/Oo)

It had been two days since the wedding and things had begun to calm 
down. Max and Miriya had moved into the Married Officers Quarters and 
were deliriously happy together. Which is not to say that things were 
going smoothly; Miriya was discovering such things as cooking were 
formidable tasks. She had set the kitchen on fire no less than three 
times and sent the coffee pot into a thermonuclear meltdown while trying 
to make coffee. Max was very patient with her, however, and resigned 
himself to doing the cooking for the near future.

Miriya wasn&#39;t taking her failures in the kitchen very well, but had soon 
discovered a friend in misery. Apparently, Akane had the same problems 
in the kitchen and that reassured Miriya. At least it was a problem that 
afflicted Micronians as well. Thus, it was something of a relief when 
Max and Miriya were invited to dinner with Ranma and Lisa. Miriya was 
very eager to see Yoshima again as well. There was something about the 
baby that made her feel a strange sense of need.

Max and Miriya arrived at the appointed hour and as soon as greetings 
were made, Miriya was at the bassinet cooing and playing with little 
Yoshima.

&quot;Would you like to hold him?&quot; Ranma offered with a warm smile. Lisa and 
Nodoka snapped their gaze to Ranma, instantly tense. &quot;Oh, you two relax. 
Not every warrior is a ham-handed brute. She held him for over an hour 
the day Max came to introduce me to her and she did fine. She&#39;s a 
natural.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Miriya said. She gently reached into the bassinet and 
tenderly picked Yoshima up. The baby made delighted sounds and seemed 
nearly as fascinated with Miriya as she was with him. &quot;Oh Max,&quot; Miriya 
said pleadingly, &quot;when can we get one?&quot;

&quot;I...um...well...we&#39;reworkingonthat,honey,&quot; Max said with a deep blush.

&quot;We are?&quot; Miriya said in surprise. &quot;I didn&#39;t know that. Where do we go 
to have one made?&quot;

Four sets blinking eyes looked at her for a minute. Finally Ranma&#39;s 
snort of laughter broke the dead silence.

&quot;You haven&#39;t explained this to her yet, have you, Max?&quot; Ranma giggled.

&quot;I...well...uh...no,&quot; Max stammered blushing deeply.

&quot;Explained what?&quot; Miriya wanted to know.

&quot;Lisa? You wanna handle this one?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Oh no, Dearest,&quot; Lisa smirked. &quot;You&#39;re her best friend. You should 
explain it to her.&quot;

&quot;Mom?&quot; Ranma looked at Nodoka pleadingly. Nodoka just grinned wickedly 
and shook her head. &quot;Oh boy,&quot; Ranma sighed. &quot;Miriya, lets go in the 
bedroom for a minute so we don&#39;t cause your husband to die of 
embarrassment.&quot;

The pair entered Ranma and Lisa&#39;s room and Ranma shut the door. She 
directed Miriya to sit on the bed and sat down facing her.

&quot;Okay, I guess I get to tell you all about human sexuality 101,&quot; Ranma 
smiled uncomfortably.

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Miriya asked.

&quot;Well, first let me ask you this,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Do Meltradi, well, 
menstruate?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Miriya asked, sounding like a broken record, but 
listening with wide-eyed attention. She was clearly eager to learn 
everything there was to know about how to get her own baby.

&quot;Well, a female has a biological cycle...er...well, do you ever bleed 
from down there,&quot; Ranma said gesturing to her nether region.

&quot;OH! That! Well, not normally but if we miss our yearly implants, it 
does happen,&quot; Miriya said. &quot;It&#39;s a great burden for the Meltradi to have 
to have a stupid yearly implant so as to not bleed to death.&quot; Ranma put 
her hand over her mouth and snickered a little.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Ranma apologized at Miriya&#39;s hurt look. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t bleed 
to death, Sweetie. It&#39;s natural for a female to bleed from there for a 
few days a month. It&#39;s part of her natural cycle.&quot;

&quot;You mean you do it?&quot; Miriya asked, incredulously. &quot;Micronians don&#39;t 
have medication to stop it?&quot;

&quot;Well, there are certain birth control methods that will prevent it,&quot; 
Ranma explained, &quot;but most women have to just deal with it. It&#39;s kinda 
gross and messy, but yeah, I go through it every month.&quot;

&quot;Oh my,&quot; Miriya said, wide-eyed. &quot;But what does this have to do with 
babies?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m getting there,&quot; Ranma grinned weakly. &quot;You feel an attraction to 
Max right?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes, most definitely,&quot; Miriya smiled brightly.

&quot;Do you know why you feel that attraction?&quot; Ranma inquired.

&quot;Um...not really. He such a skilled and strong warrior, and whenever he 
looks at me, I feel all warm and gooey inside,&quot; Miriya said, blushing 
slightly.

&quot;Women are attracted to men that their instincts tell them will provide 
them with strong healthy babies,&quot; Ranma explained. &quot;It&#39;s a mating 
instinct, just like animals have.&quot;

&quot;So how do they provide babies?&quot; Miriya asked.

Ranma sighed, and began to explain human reproduction to Miriya, 
complete with pictures of Lisa&#39;s progress through her own pregnancy and 
the video of the childbirth. When she was done Miriya&#39;s eyes were as 
wide as saucers and she sat stunned.

&quot;That&#39;s what would happen to me?&quot; Miriya asked. &quot;It looked so painful.&quot;

&quot;Yes, but did you see the look on Lisa&#39;s face afterward, as she held 
Yoshima for the first time?&quot; Ranma asked gently.

&quot;She looked so...blissful,&quot; Miriya said. &quot;I have a question though...&quot;

&quot;Sure, ask away?&quot; Ranma smiled.

&quot;You said that for a woman to get...pregnant, she must have sex with her 
husband. But you and Lisa are both females, so how did Lisa get 
pregnant?&quot; Miriya asked in confusion.

&quot;Well, there are several ways it could have happened,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;The 
man doesn&#39;t have to be the woman&#39;s husband. Having sex with any man 
could get a girl pregnant. There&#39;s also artificial insemination, where 
an egg is taken from the woman and fertilized in a lab then implanted 
back in her womb. This is how most lesbian couples have babies. But how 
we did it, is part of the reason we asked you to dinner tonight. You 
see, I have a secret. Very few people know about this and fewer still 
would believe it without seeing it. Everyone in Wild Rose knows, 
including Max. Since you&#39;re a part of the Squadron now, it&#39;s only fair 
that you know as well. It&#39;s kind of shocking, so how about we go back 
out there so Max can help?&quot;

The two women reentered the main room to find a deeply blushing Max. 
Seeing Max blushing, Miriya blushed as well.

&quot;I take it you got it all explained,&quot; Lisa smirked.

&quot;Yeah, I might have overdone it with the video of Yoshima&#39;s birth 
though,&quot; Ranma said chagrinned.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Lisa asked.

&quot;Yeah, I think it scared her a little,&quot; Ranma admitted.

&quot;Was it worth it?&quot; Miriya asked Lisa.

&quot;It may have looked bad, but it was the most rewarding thing I&#39;ve ever 
done,&quot; Lisa stated emphatically. Miriya nodded.

&quot;I hope I can be as strong as you when the time comes,&quot; Miriya said.

&quot;It&#39;s natural, Honey,&quot; Nodoka said reassuringly. &quot;It&#39;s what women were 
built for. You can handle it, I&#39;m positive.&quot; Miriya, again, nodded.

&quot;We got up to the point where it&#39;s time to tell her about my condition,&quot; 
Ranma said. &quot;Miriya, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen some odd things in you 
travels, huh?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes, definitely,&quot; she agreed.

&quot;Have you ever seen any magic?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Miriya asked. It was becoming a common utterance for her 
tonight.

&quot;Magic is a force, or power that science can&#39;t explain,&quot; Max said. &quot;It 
can do things that are scientifically and technologically impossible.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Miriya said. &quot;No, I&#39;ve never seen anything like that.&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t be able to say that after tonight,&quot; Lisa grinned.

&quot;Please understand, that this needs to be kept in the strictest 
confidence,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I need you to give me your strongest oath that 
you won&#39;t tell another soul about what you are about to see.&quot; Miriya 
nodded in understanding.

&quot;I swear on my honor as a warrior that I won&#39;t tell anyone your secret,&quot; 
Miriya vowed.

An explanation and two demonstrations later and Miriya sat stunned once 
more. They discussed Ranma&#39;s condition and her status for another hour 
until dinner was ready. Miriya didn&#146;t think her eyes were ever going to 
go back to normal size again after all the shocks she had seen tonight. 
The only thing that prevented her from going off the deep end was the 
fact that Max was completely calm and took it all in stride.

Miriya had no trouble with Ranma&#39;s claim to being mostly female in spite 
of her birth sex. The Zentradi had no real preconceived notions or 
taboos about this. It was the actual change that shook her up most. In 
the end, while it may have been the most fantastic of the things she had 
learned tonight, it didn&#39;t rate much more shock than the others.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Captain, I&#39;m picking up a single Zentradi ship approaching,&quot; Vanessa 
said.

&quot;Put the fighters on alert,&quot; Gloval ordered. &quot;Lisa, ready the main gun.&quot;

&quot;Aye aye, Sir,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Roy, I want Ranma&#39;s flight on the cats. Have 
the rest of Wild Rose and Skull on ready alert.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Roy said.

&quot;Captain, I&#39;m receiving a signal from the Zentradi ship,&quot; Sammy chimed 
in.

&quot;Put it on the speaker, please, Sammy,&quot; Gloval said.

&quot;...unarmed. Repeat, we are sending an unarmed envoy to meet with you,&quot; 
the voice over the speaker said. &quot;Please hold your fire. We do not have 
hostile intent. Our weapons systems are offline and unarmed.&quot; The 
message began to repeat again as the Zentradi ship ceased its approach 
and waited.

&quot;Sammy, send our agreement to meet with them and inform them that we are 
sending an escort to bring them aboard,&quot; Gloval said.

&quot;Yes, Sir,&quot; Sammy said and carried out the orders. &quot;They have 
acknowledged Captain.&quot;

&quot;Very well, launch the escort,&quot; Gloval said.

&quot;Escort away, Sir,&quot; Roy said.

&quot;Captain, I&#39;m picking up the launch of a single pod from the Zentradi 
ship,&quot; Vanessa reported.

(oO\O/Oo)

A half an hour later, Ranma was in a jeep with the Zentradi Emissary, 
the oddly shaped man that Ranma had seen before during the interrogation 
named Exedore. Exedore, of course, didn&#39;t recognize Ranma from the 
interrogation, but he did recognize her. In fact, he seemed quite happy 
about meeting her.

&quot;You&#39;re one of the Micronian females that do what you call singing, 
aren&#39;t you?&quot; Exedore asked.

&quot;You could say that, yeah,&quot; Ranma said guardedly.

&quot;Why do you do that?&quot; the Zentradi minister asked curiously.

&quot;Well, to make people happy, I guess,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;People seem to enjoy 
it and happy people boost morale.&quot;

&quot;So you deny it&#39;s some sort of weapon?&quot; Exedore asked.

&quot;Look, Exedore,&quot; Ranma sighed, &quot;singing is just singing. It&#39;s of no 
military significance to us.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Exedore said slyly. &quot;So where are we now?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re going through the shopping district of Macross City at the 
moment,&quot; Ranma answered.

&quot;Ah, yes, the place were you Micronians go to exchange what you call 
money for goods,&quot; Exedore said in understanding.

&quot;Right,&quot; Ranma agreed.

&quot;And what is the purpose of that?&quot; Exedore asked, pointing to a 
billboard with a bikini clad girl on it.

&quot;That&#39;s an advertisement,&quot; Ranma informed him.

&quot;And what is an &#39;advertisement&#39;,&quot; Exedore inquired.

&quot;It&#39;s supposed to make people want to buy what ever product it being 
advertised,&quot; Ranma explained. &quot;That particular display is promoting body 
lotion.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Exedore said. &quot;So why does it show an unclothed female?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s supposed to make other females want to buy the stuff so their skin 
can look as nice as the one in the picture,&quot; Ranma answered. &quot;Look, we 
could go into all the theories and thoughts behind advertising, but it 
would take a few hours and it really isn&#39;t relevant.&quot;

&quot;Ah, so it&#39;s a military secret,&quot; Exedore said knowingly. Ranma snorted 
in laughter and rolled her eyes.

&quot;No, it&#39;s not a military secret,&quot; Ranma explained in exasperation. &quot;It&#39;s 
just not something that really needs to be discussed unless the Zentradi 
are planning to go from a warrior race to a consumer-based culture. 
Which is something that I, personally, would heartily approve of so we 
could stop killing each other and go home.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to ask so many questions,&quot; Exedore said. &quot;But there are just 
so many interesting things here.&quot; Ranma gave him a smile, which made the 
minister feel all gooey inside.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Believe me, any military secrets we 
might have, you will not be seeing. It&#39;s not as if we leave these things 
lying about in plain sight, you know.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I suppose that does make sense,&quot; Exedore said chagrined.

&quot;Anything you see you are free to ask me about,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Just don&#39;t 
expect me to go into any long boring theories about the how&#39;s and why&#39;s. 
If you want to know, then I&#39;m sure once there is peace between our 
people that we&#39;d be glad to exchange all the cultural information that 
you&#39;d like to whatever extent you&#39;d like. But right now it&#39;s just not 
useful information.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Exedore said.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Would you like a drink, Sir?&quot; the steward asked Exedore as they awaited 
the arrival of all the key personnel.

&quot;Why yes, thank you,&quot; Exedore said.

The steward placed a glass of fruit juice in front of the Zentradi 
Minister. Exedore picked up the glass and sniffed it, unsure of what the 
liquid was. He took a small sip and then quickly quaffed the whole glass 
like he was dying of thirst.

&quot;My, that was VERY refreshing,&quot; he said in amazement. The steward 
giggled as she placed another glass in front of him.

&quot;Here have another, Sir,&quot; she said pleasantly, taking the empty glass.

At this point the door opened and admitted Max and Miriya. Exedore 
glanced up from his juice and did a double take.

&quot;Greetings, Quadrano Leader,&quot; Exedore said, standing.

&quot;OH!&quot; Miriya said, startled. &quot;Minister Exedore, forgive me, I had no 
idea you would be the emissary.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Exedore said pointing to her. &quot;I must say we found your 
joining ritual to be most fascinating.&quot;

&quot;Oh, you must mean the wedding,&quot; Miriya said in a subdued tone.

&quot;And this must be the male half of your pair,&quot; Exedore said, pointing to 
Max.

&quot;Um, yeah, that&#39;s him,&quot; Miriya said, looking at the floor uncomfortably.

&quot;Well you don&#39;t have to sound all thrilled about it,&quot; Max said 
sarcastically.

The door opened again revealing Rico, Konda, and Bron. The trio froze 
when they saw Exedore. Exedore grinned wickedly at them and waved.

&quot;Minister Exedore!&quot; Rico exclaimed.

&quot;I must say, I didn&#39;t expect to see the instigators of the mass 
defection at this meeting,&quot; Exedore said.

&quot;It wasn&#39;t us,&quot; Konda denied.

&quot;It wasn&#39;t our fault,&quot; Bron said in fear.

&quot;You can relax,&quot; Exedore said. &quot;I didn&#39;t come here to harm you.&quot;

The three let out a sigh of relief and went to take their seats.

At this point Ranma and Lisa came in.

&quot;You!&quot; Exedore exclaimed, jabbing a finger at Lisa. &quot;You were one of the 
prisoners that escaped Breetei&#39;s flagship!&quot;

&quot;Uh, yes, that was me,&quot; Lisa admitted.

&quot;Well the situation is different now, but tell me,&quot; Exedore asked, &quot;how 
did you escape? Was it by some secret Micronian powers?&quot;

&quot;Not at all,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;It was by determination and skill.&quot;

&quot;And pure, blind luck,&quot; Ranma muttered, only to receive an elbow to the 
ribs.

&quot;I see,&quot; Exedore said as Ranma and Lisa took their seats.

&quot;Well, now that we are all here, why don&#39;t you tell us what it is you 
wish to discuss with us, Minister Exedore,&quot; Gloval suggested.

&quot;Your curiosity is understandable, Captain, but all the parties are not 
yet here,&quot; Exedore stated.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, who is missing?&quot; Gloval asked.

&quot;I wish to speak to the man that throws the strange energy blasts 
without a weapon,&quot; Exedore said. &quot;I would also like to speak with the 
other female who is at the core of you psychological assault that you 
call &#39;singing&#39;.&quot;

Ranma groaned and resisted the urge to bang her head on the table.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but you&#39;ll have to be more specific,&quot; Gloval said. &quot;I know 
of no psychological assault.&quot;

&quot;Captain, I think he&#39;s referring to Kai Pao Wei and Minmei,&quot; Ranma said. 
&quot;I&#39;ve already explained that the singing isn&#39;t an attack of some kind, 
but obviously I didn&#39;t get through.&quot;

&quot;Very well, have Kai Pao Wei brought here immediately and have Ensign 
Lynn come down from the bridge.&quot;

After a half hour wait, Kai was shown in. Minmei had arrived shortly 
after Gloval had requested her.

&quot;Now we are all here,&quot; Exedore said. &quot;Mr. Wei, what is your military 
rank?&quot;

&quot;Rank? I&#39;m a civilian,&quot; Kai said.

&quot;With super powers like yours, I doubt it,&quot; Exedore said.

&quot;Super powers? I don&#39;t have super powers,&quot; Kai said in confusion.

&quot;He&#39;s talking about the movie,&quot; Ranma clarified for everyone.

&quot;Ah, Minister, that was a movie, for entertainment,&quot; Gloval explained. 
&quot;It wasn&#39;t real. Mr. Wei has no super powers and the same can be said 
for everyone in this room.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not necessarily true, Captain,&quot; Ranma disagreed.

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Gloval asked, slightly irritated.

&quot;Well, what was depicted in the movie was a ki blast, a projection of 
life energy,&quot; Ranma explained. &quot;It&#39;s a martial arts technique and very 
much possible. You&#39;ve seen my battle aura. A ki blast is the same stuff, 
only it&#39;s condensed and projected at a target.&quot;

&quot;I would like a demonstration,&quot; Exedore said.

&quot;I&#39;m not able to do a ki blast yet,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I&#39;m close, but I 
haven&#39;t gotten it quite figured out yet. I can do other things with my 
ki though.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you could demonstrate, Ranma,&quot; Lisa suggested.

&quot;Okay,&quot; Ranma said, glad, for once, to be asked to show off her martial 
arts abilities instead of her body or her voice. &quot;First, I&#39;ll 
demonstrate the battle aura for those that haven&#39;t seen it.&quot;

&quot;Please do, Commander,&quot; Gloval said, smirking. He knew this was quite 
impressive.

Ranma walked up to Exedore.

&quot;Are you ready Minister?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Certainly,&quot; Exedore said.

Suddenly Ranma&#39;s body burst into bright blue flames and her eyes glowed 
a bright blue.

Exedore gasped, rising and taking a step back. Rico, Konda, and Bron 
ducked under the table, remembering the brutal violence unleashed the 
last time they saw this.

&quot;Miss Macross is scary,&quot; Bron whimpered.

&quot;Terrifying,&quot; Konda agreed.

Ranma cupped her hands near her belly and began to pull her battle aura 
into a ball of energy that hovered slightly above them. The energy 
condensed and turned brighter. She turned toward the wall and yell &#39;ha&#39; 
before pushing the ball toward the wall. It flew toward the wall, but it 
was clear it was dissipating too fast. It struck the wall with a dull 
thud and left a slight scorch mark.

&quot;That&#39;s the best I can do right now, but I know other masters of the art 
that can reportedly do much more,&quot; Ranma explained, breathing heavily.

&quot;Very interesting,&quot; Exedore said nervously as he went over to the scorch 
mark and examined it.

&quot;You can come back up now guys,&quot; Kai chuckled at the three men hiding 
under the table. &quot;She&#39;s not glowing anymore.&quot;

The three came back up and breathed a sigh of relief.

&quot;Hey, Bron, you look pretty strong, come here a second,&quot; Ranma directed.

&quot;Yes, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Bron said fearfully.

&quot;Minister, you seem to know this man,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;How strong is he in 
relation to the Zentradi?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s very strong, Commander,&quot; Exedore said.

&quot;Do you think any one in this room could beat him in a contest of 
strength?&quot; Ranma asked. Exedore looked around the room. Bron certainly 
seemed to be the largest male in the room.

&quot;I doubt it,&quot; Exedore answered.

&quot;What if I told you I could over power him easily?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;I would like to see that, Commander,&quot; Exedore said, obviously 
skeptical, but unwilling to discount it after what he had seen.

&quot;Have you experienced arm wrestling yet, Bron?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Sure,&quot; Bron said. &quot;The Zentradi do that too. I was one of the best on 
the ship.&quot;

&quot;Think you can beat me?&quot; Ranma smirked.

Bron looked down at the petite female in front of him.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen you in action, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Bron said. &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s find out, shall we?&quot; Ranma grinned wickedly.

&quot;Um...okay, just don&#39;t do that blue glowy thing, okay?&quot; Bron said 
nervously.

&quot;Sure, no problem,&quot; Ranma smile reassuringly at him.

They got down on either side of the table and grabbed hands. Ranma 
nodded readiness and Bron began to try to force her wrist to the table, 
the muscles of his forearm bulging and the veins of his neck standing 
out. Ranma&#39;s arm remained still while she seemed to be putting forth no 
real effort.

&quot;Minister,&quot; Ranma asked with no apparent strain in her voice, &quot;you wanna 
help him out? Go on, grab our hands and try to force my wrist down with 
everything you have.&quot;

Exedore grabbed on with both hands and began to pull, grunting with the 
effort. Ranma&#39;s arm moved this time...in the opposite direction. She 
smirked as she brought her Bron&#39;s wrist smoothly toward the table. 
Finally it was touching and Bron conceded. Murmurs traveled through the 
room as many didn&#39;t really realized just how strong Ranma actually was.

&quot;That was most impressive,&quot; Exedore said, gasping for breath. &quot;I would 
have never thought someone so petite would be capable of that kind of 
strength. How is it possible?&quot;

&quot;The same way I produce a battle aura,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I use my ki, my 
life energy, to augment my muscles and bones to strengthen them. I can 
do the same thing to increase my speed.&quot;

&quot;And other Micronians can do this?&quot; Exedore asked.

&quot;Currently I know of one other aboard this ship that can,&quot; Ranma said. 
&quot;Several on Earth can do it. Honestly, anyone can, with the proper 
dedication to training in the martial arts.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;How much longer do you intend for us to just sit here, Breetai?&quot; Azonia 
asked, appearing on his monitor.

&quot;There is little more we can do given the circumstances,&quot; Breetai said.

&quot;Yes, well, we&#39;ll see about that,&quot; Azonia said imperiously. &quot;I&#39;ve sent 
my report of this incident to Dolza and he is bringing the Grand Fleet 
here as we speak.&quot;

&quot;YOU DID WHAT?&quot; Breetai exclaimed. &quot;You fool! Do you realize what you&#39;ve 
done?&quot; Azonia was taken aback by Breetai&#39;s reaction. &quot;You doomed us all! 
Don&#39;t you see? We have all been contaminated by the Micronians and Dolza 
will exterminate us to keep the contamination from spreading.&quot;

&quot;I...I...that never occurred to me,&quot; Azonia said in shock. &quot;We must 
leave then.&quot;

&quot;We cannot,&quot; Breetai said tiredly. &quot;We don&#39;t have enough Protoculture 
left. Unless we can get the factory from the Micronians then we will 
share their fate.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;I see,&quot; Exedore said. &quot;That is a most distressing development.&quot; He hung 
up the handset, and addressed the assembly. &quot;I regret to inform you that 
Supreme commander Dolza is on his way to this system with the Grand 
Fleet to destroy you all.&quot;

&quot;The Grand Fleet,&quot; Gloval said. &quot;Do you think he means the one in your 
report?&quot;

&quot;Most likely,&quot; Lisa said.

&quot;Yes, the Grand Fleet,&quot; Exedore said. &quot;At this very moment 4 million, 
800 thousand battle ready warships are headed here. You must leave the 
system at once.&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t do that,&quot; Gloval said. &quot;We are sworn to protect the Earth at 
any cost.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Exedore said. &quot;The Zentradi would not have acted any 
differently in your position. However, it seems that we must now join 
forces against a common enemy.&quot;

&quot;Explain,&quot; Gloval said.

&quot;Our forces currently in system have been contaminated by your Micronian 
culture,&quot; Exedore told them. He began to walk toward the head of the 
table where Gloval sat. &quot;This has happened once before in our history 
and it nearly destroyed us completely. Dolza will seek to avoid making 
the same mistakes of our ancestors by exterminating the contamination. 
We do not have the energy to leave the system without your help so our 
lot has been cast with yours I&#39;m afraid.&quot; Exedore reached Gloval and 
stuck out his hand in friendship as Ranma had shown him upon his 
arrival.

&quot;Very well,&quot; Gloval said, taking Exedore&#39;s hand. &quot;We will face this 
threat as comrades then.&quot;

&quot;Minmei, Ranma, it has been an honor to meet you both,&quot; Exedore said. 
&quot;Without your singing, this alliance would never have been possible.&quot;

What followed was an in-depth planning session that lasted well into the 
night.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Azonia, what have you decided?&quot; Breetai asked.

&quot;I&#39;ve decide I have no choice but to fight,&quot; Azonia said. &quot;It will be an 
honor to go into battle by your side, Lord Breetai.&quot;

&quot;May you win every battle,&quot; Breetai said.

&quot;And you as well,&quot; Azonia said as her image flicked off.

&quot;And you, Grell? What are you plans?&quot; Breetai asked.

&quot;We can&#39;t run,&quot; Grell said. &quot;They would eventually find us. We will 
fight.&quot;

&quot;Very well,&quot; Breetai said. &quot;You have more courage than Kyron. If he were 
still in command, I would have expected him to run. May you win every 
battle, Grell.&quot;

&quot;And you as well, Mi&#39;lord,&quot; Grell said and disconnected.

(oO\O/Oo)

All around the planet Earth, scores of ships began to defold in clusters 
so dense, they blocked the view of the surface of the planet and began 
spreading like a cancer. A cancer that would kill the entire planet.
