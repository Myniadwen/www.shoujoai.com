<h2>Reversals</h2>
<p>Rei jumped to Zhu Shu’s side, mirrored by Akane.  “Are you alright?” They asked simultaneously.<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Zhu Shu fine. Was just surprise.  Swords never do before.” She looked down at the glowing dragons etched along  the blades, slowly dimming from the fiery display. “Always push chi through  swords… Swords never draw.”<p>
  Rei reached out to touch the slightly humming blade.  “It looked like that in the vision that surrounded you when that girl was  healing-”<p>
  Her fingers touched the metal and with a gasp, she  found herself once more in a vision.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Rei stood on a high wall overlooking a sunset as the  elegant flying ship descended, its wispy sails sparkling in the light of the  setting sun.  Like a golden dragonfly, it  eased into its berth in the royal hanger.   She was surprised to see that the Dragon banner was flying from the  stern.  It was rare to see Lin Tzu’s  banner on the weekly courier instead of the Moon Kingdom’s.  That meant it was on Imperial business rather than just running diplomatic  dispatches. <p>
  More shocking was the sight of the Dragon’s Guardian  standing at the rail in a tunic and pants, her bladed staff covered in its  travel bag. If she was aboard, that meant the empress herself was.  Curious. What could have prompted Lin Tzu to  travel to the Moon in secret?  No-one had  advised any of the Emissaries that she was out of the palace when the courier  had left 3 days ago, indeed the Royal Physician had appeared to the court to  say the empress was ‘indisposed’, which most of the court took to mean she’d  found a new wife and was busy wooing her.   Rei had frowned at the overheard comment, annoyed that so many of her  fellow ambassadors made fun of Lin Tzu’s many loves.  <p>
  The Guardian nodded at her as the ship docked.  “Greetings, Lady Phoenix.  I did not expect you to meet the ship  personally.  A miscalculation I hope will  not lead to difficulties,” she said with a questioning note.<p>
  Rei shook her head.   “Of course I won’t tell anyone Lin Tzu was visiting Serenity, my Lady.  Is she well?”<p>
  “I am quite well, my darling Phoenix.   Serenity wished to see me privately and you know how state visits can  be.  There’s no <em>real</em> need for stealth, but gossip travels.” <p>
  Rei turned to look at the Empress, who had emerged  from the cabin and was smiling at her.   She bowed.  “I am happy to see you  have come home safely, your majesty.”<p>
  “Please, Lady Phoenix, can you not simply call me Lin  Tzu, or at least Lady Song?”<p>
  Rei smiled.   “It’s a force of habit, Lady Song.”<p>
  Lin Tzu laughed.   “Serenity asked how you were doing as her representative, and was very  pleased to hear the glowing report I gave of you.”<p>
  Rei blushed.  “I  would be a horrible diplomat without your coaching, Lady Song.  I am a warrior.  These word games played by the nobles turn my  stomach.  I still wish I knew why you  requested me for this position.”<p>
  Lin Tzu’s eyes sparkled.  “You’ll think I’m a terrible ruler if I tell  you the reason, my dear.” She said with an amused tone.<p>
  “I could never think that, your majesty.  I have watched you rule too long to doubt  that you truly strive to be an honorable and just Lord.”<p>
  “Even if I said the reason I picked you was because  you had pretty eyes?”<p>
  Rei blushed.   She could never really be sure if Lin Tzu’s flirtatious comments were  serious or not, and for safety’s sake tried to assume they were not.  “For a court so filled with beauty, I suppose  that could be a necessary quality, Lady Song.   Though I would hope I had other qualities to recommend me.”<p>
  Lin Tzu’s Guardian laughed.  “Don’t let my beloved tease you too hard,  Lady Phoenix.  I influenced her decision  as well.  A warrior’s point of view is  valuable in a position where war may be decided.  It is also well for you to learn the  political maneuvering that takes place within the halls of power.  No general should be ignorant of the games  played by those who would spill their blood without a second’s thought.”<p>
  “You’re ruining my fun again, my love.” Lin Tzu  laughed.  “Our lovely Phoenix is doing quite well at learning to  spread her wings and fly.” She nodded towards the cabin.  “Do come in.   My overprotective darling wants me to wait here until she has summoned  the rest of the guard, so you can keep me company.  Besides, Serenity gave me something that I  want to show you.”<p>
  Rei nodded and accepted the invite as Lin Tzu’s  bodyguard dispatched the ship’s cabin boy off to the guard’s station and took  up her post at the door.  Lin Tzu had a  huge smile as Rei took a seat on the couch in the cabin.  She waited till Rei was seated then pulled  out a transformation wand, the elegant silver rod accented in red and gold,  it’s heart shaped end-piece decorated with a gold ring around a central dot.<p>
  “Serenity wouldn’t let me say no when she gave me  this.  I’m half convinced it’s an excuse  to see me in a short skirt.”<p>
  “She made you a Senshi?”<p>
  “An honorary one.   She claims it was simply to repay all my efforts on her behalf.”<p>
  Rei nodded.  “It <em>is</em> the highest honor in the Moon Kingdom,  my lady.” <p>
  Lin Tzu held it up and called the transformation  phrase, and Rei blushed as she was treated to the sight of the empress naked mid  henshin.  Then her clothes reformed into  a tight Mandarin style top, with a high collar that tied closed with small  golden clasps, and a seam that ran across her left breast to descend down her  side to the short scarlet fuku edged in gold.   It lacked the short sleeves of the other Senshi’s uniforms, being  entirely sleeveless, and the red and gold slippers on her feet were soft soled  and lacked heels.  It did have a big  scarlet and gold bow attached to the base of her spine where the top and skirt  joined, and the ribbons ends swept out behind her like a swallow’s tail.  The large gold and ebony earrings she wore  were yin/yang symbols, and they offset the slightly more ornate tiara, the  silhouette of twin dragon’s heads meeting where their jaws gripped the blood  red ruby on her brow.  Her henshin had  also brought out the swords Serenity had commissioned for her many years  previously, the twin Song broadswords that had been forged with the Silver  Crystal as a bond between their Kingdoms when Lin Tzu had first come to  Serenity with a secret warning of danger.   She twirled them, the ribbons dancing around her as she turned to show  off the Sailor outfit.<p>
  “Not really my usual style, but Serenity seems to  think I am in more danger here on Earth than she is.  She wanted to ensure I had a means to draw  upon the powers of the Silver Crystal should the need arise.”<p>
  Rei nodded.  “I  can see my Queen’s reasoning, Lady Song.   She charged me with seeing to your safety as well. The Moon’s defenses  are formidable, and any assault would be seen long before it could arrive.  A sneak attack on the Dragon Palace  is far more likely, especially with your brother’s rebels still in hiding.”<p>
  Lin Tzu sighed.   “That was part of the tidings as well.   Xi’an Chi has been made one of Beryl’s advisers.  He gathers ever more political favor to  himself while doing much to discredit my influence with the High King.  The Empire of the Dragon has the largest  standing military among the Kingdoms, so I suspect Xi’an Chi is seeking to  usurp my throne to give himself an army of conquest.  Beryl’s influence has waxed much lately,  while mine has waned.  I fear he seeks to  use her access to the High King to get him to replace me.  I do not wish to have to rebel against the  King, but I cannot allow Xi’an Chi to have the Dragon Throne.   I wish the scryers could foresee this doom  approaching more clearly, it would do much to help me chart my murky path.”<p>
  Rei nodded.  “I  wish that the High King would give heed to their prophecies, but he believes  Beryl’s proclamations of peace and prosperity.”<p>
  Lin Tzu nodded.   She held out the sword in her right hand, and a golden fire burned down  the blade, the etched dragon igniting into fiery life.  “I swore on these swords that our alliance  would stand until the last Dragon drew breath.   Come what may, I will never abandon that oath.  If all the kingdoms of the Earth were to rise  against us, I will still defend the Kingdom of the Moon, for if the Moon falls  forever into shadow all hope will die.   That was the prophecy that sent me first to Serenity, and why I sought  the Dragon and became his Child.  Even if  I should fall, so long as my heirs survive to carry this burden and bear these  swords, I have bound us to this oath.   The Dragon and the Moon shall face our doom together…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>“Rei?”<p>
  Akane was shaking her. <p>
  “Rei? Are you ok?”<p>
  “Rei-chan is alright?” came Zhu Shu’s concerned voice.<p>
  Rei gasped and started, her heart pounding as she  realized she was still in the Tendo’s shrine instead of a ships cabin. “I’m ok,  I’m ok…”<p>
  “You just froze in mid sentence and were staring at  nothing. We weren’t even sure you were breathing.” Akane said.<p>
  Rei nodded. “I get like that when I’m having a vision…  I just… well… I wasn’t trying to scry - I just touched the blade and a vision,  or maybe a memory came to me. I’m fine.” She shook her head, the details  already fading. “I- I saw Lin Tzu again.   She- she was talking to me and showing me the wand that Artemis gave  you.  She used it to transform and she  looked just like you did when that girl healed you…” She looked around the dojo  to make sure they were alone. “Like a Senshi.”<p>
  Zhu Shu raised an eyebrow. “Swords are family  heirloom.”<p>
  Rei nodded. “The Empress said her oath would stand  until the last Dragon-” she caught her breath.<p>
  “Zhu Shu <em>is</em> last Dragon. But only until bear heir.” Zhu Shu smiled. “Is interesting, but  Zhu Shu not Lin Tzu. Zhu Shu only descendant of Imperial Servants.”<p>
  Rei smiled. “I’m not so sure of that Zhu-chan.  You look exactly like her, just a little  younger.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu is Zhu Shu.” She stood. “And Zhu Shu want  know what Senshi saw when she healed. Usagi start to mention earlier, but get  hushed. Now Rei mention. What vision?”<p>
  Rei considered for a few moments then said “You were  dressed in a scarlet and gold fuku, and had a dragon tiara on. The swords were  surrounded by a golden fire. The vision I just had showed Lin Tzu the same  way.  She carried both the wand and the  swords.  <em>You </em>have both of them now.   You <em>have</em> to be the Empress’s  heir.”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head. “Zhu Shu servant. Whatever  honored Ancestors were.” She put the blades behind her back.<p>
  Rei rolled her eyes. “One day I will figure out how  you do that.”<p>
  Zhu Shu smiled. “Think Zen.”<p>
  “Oh, that helps!” Rei said sarcastically.<p>
  Akane giggled. “Don’t ask me. I have no idea how I do  it either. If I think about it, I can’t”<p>
  Rei laughed. “That’s because your conscious mind  interferes. It’s like magic. You can’t analyze it, you just do it.”<p>
  The sound of Ranma and Genma involved in their after  dinner practice interrupted the conversation and they wondered back into the  living room. Akane whispered something to Zhu Shu, and they both smiled, then  nudged Rei. “Why don’t you go ask Kasumi if she’d like some help?” Akane  prodded.<p>
  Rei blinked at her blankly for a few seconds before she  realized what Akane was really up to - giving her an excuse to talk to Kasumi  about Zhu Shu, then she smiled and nodded.<p>
  Kasumi was nearly done with the cleaning up from  dinner, but she’d put a kettle on for cocoa. When Rei came into the kitchen she  smiled. “Hello, Rei-chan. Did you enjoy dinner?”<p>
  “Yes. I thank you very much for allowing me to dine  with you.”<p>
  “You’re always welcome dear. Zhu Shu is family and  you’re her friend.”<p>
  Rei gave her a rueful grin. “That’s kind of why I’m  here. Akane said I might be able to talk to you.”<p>
  Kasumi wiped the water off her hands and pulled two  cups off the shelf. “Of course. Would you like some Cocoa, or Tea?”<p>
  Rei smiled. “I have a weakness for chocolate.”<p>
  Kasumi made them both some cocoa and settled down at  the small kitchen table, her skirts flaring out around her as she sat down. “So  what would you like to talk about Rei-chan?”<p>
  Rei blushed, suddenly too embarrassed to speak.<p>
  “Oh my.” Kasumi said. “Would it happen to be your  feelings for Zhu Shu?”<p>
  Rei started. “How-“<p>
  Kasumi smiled. “Dear… it was obvious the first time I  met you that you had a crush on her.”<p>
  Rei blushed even brighter. “Was I <em>that</em> obvious?”<p>
  “To me dear. Probably not to anyone else. Zhu Shu  knew.”<p>
  “What? She knew?”<p>
  “Yes. She didn’t want to play with your feelings dear.  She didn’t want to influence your choices, since she knew you looked up to  her.”<p>
  Rei scowled. “I wish I had known.”<p>
  “Would it really have made a difference? Rei, she’s  your sensei, and <em>you</em>, most  especially, have a case of hero worship for her, because you feel guilty about  something that happened. She could have seduced you pretty easily, but she  didn’t want to hurt you. She really cares about all of you girls.”<p>
  “Yeah… I guess I <em>do</em> feel guilty, I mean I was the one who told the Senshi to-“ She broke off as she  realized what she’d said.<p>
  “Oh my… So that’s the big secret Akane has been hiding  and Nabiki has been trying to get you to admit to.” She leaned over and patted  Rei’s hand. “Don’t worry Rei. Akane wouldn’t tell me, so she wouldn’t tell anyone  else, and Nabiki may have figured it out, but she wouldn’t do anything to  endanger you. And I won’t tell a soul.”<p>
  Rei sighed. “It’s ok, I guess. Ranma knows too, and  Shan Pu. In a way I suppose it’s a relief to have someone we don’t have to hide  who we really are from other than each other. It’s even kind of amusing that  Nabiki got Hibiki Studios to cast us as ourselves.”<p>
  Kasumi giggled. “Oh my! That is amusing.”<p>
  “Yeah, anyway, I suppose I do feel guilty, because  when Zhu Shu first showed up at Juuban ward, we found her on top of the shrine  and Ami’s computer said there were some weird energy readings on her.”<p>
  “And Ami is?”<p>
  “Oh, Sailor Mercury, she’s kind of our science  expert.” Rei supplied. “And Makoto’s Jupiter, Minako’s Venus as well as Sailor  V, and Usagi’s… well she’s Sailor Moon.”<p>
  “So you’d be Sailor Mars?”<p>
  “Yeah.” She smiled. “Anyway, when she got wet and  changed, I thought she had been possessed, so I started a exorcism.  Zhu Shu tried to stop my spell casting , and  we nearly killed her.”<p>
  “Oh, my.”<p>
  “Anyway, I took care of her and when she woke up I  found out she could see auras, so it was pointless to try and hide who we were,  then a day or so later, I found her practicing her kata in the nude - well  actually, I was woken up by sensing an evil presence, and I found her facing a  demoness. It was weird actually, because all she did was give Zhu Shu a slip of  paper with an address on it and told her to say hi to Ranma’s fiancée.” Rei’s  face fell as she looked shamefacedly at Kasumi. “I’m sorry we didn’t tell you  about Shan Pu. Zhu Shu asked us not to.”<p>
  Kasumi nodded. “It’s alright, it’s worked out so far.”<p>
  “I feel really guilty that we didn’t tell Akane.” Rei  said.<p>
  “She’s most likely already forgiven you, dear. She  does seem to have a lot of Zhu Shu’s memories in her head, so I’m sure she  knows.” Kasumi looked thoughtful. “I have to wonder why a demon would be  interested in Zhu Shu?”<p>
  Rei nodded. “I don’t know, but I haven’t seen her  since, and I’ve kept a few charms handy.”<p>
  Kasumi shrugged. “There has to be more to this puzzle,  but I don’t know where to look.” She smiled at Rei. “But we were talking about <em>you</em> dear.”<p>
  Rei blushed again. “Yeah… well… I… um…” She swallowed  hard. “I spied on her kata the next morning.”<p>
  “And?”<p>
  “Well, I don’t know. I was, well… <em>aroused.</em>” Rei admitted.<p>
  “Would it help if I told you she has that effect on me  a little too?” Kasumi noted. “She can’t really help it, you know. It was  ingrained into her.”<p>
  Rei nodded. “I suppose… I’m just so confused. She’s my  friend, and at the same time, I fantasize about doing other things with her…  and when she’s around… I feel… <em>special.</em>”<p>
  “She has a knack for that.”<p>
  Rei sighed. “I guess, in the end, I don’t know if I  want to…”<p>
  Kasumi nodded. “How old are you Rei?”<p>
  Rei blinked. “Fifteen.”<p>
  “And how many boyfriends have you had?”<p>
  “Um… well… I dated Mamoru a few times, and then… well…  not really anyone else.”<p>
  “You haven’t had much experience yet Rei. It’s only  natural you’re confused.” She reached out and held Rei’s hand. “Give it time  dear. Let it grow at it’s own pace, and see what happens. Don’t fret over it  like this.  You will figure out how you  feel without all this worry, and you don’t have to fear that you will alienate  Zhu Shu.  I know her well enough to know  she truly wants only your happiness.  There’s no <em>need</em> to rush.  Spend time together and enjoy  yourselves because what will happen, will happen.”<p>
  Rei smiled. “I suppose that’s good advice… just…”<p>
  “Not what you wanted to hear. I know. I can’t tell you <em>how</em> to feel Rei - <em>that </em>is somethingyou have to figure out on your own. But what I <em>can</em> be is someone to talk to, and I’m  more than happy to be that.”<p>
  Rei nodded, her eyes shining. “Akane was right about  you, you know. I wish I had you as a big sister.”<p>
  Kasumi smiled. “But you do dear. For so long as you  want me to be one.”<p>
  A annoyed squawk from outside the kitchen window  announced the arrival of Phobos and Deimos. Rei looked out at the two ravens,  and smiled. “Ok, ok, I’m on my way!” She looked at Kasumi “I’m sorry, they’re  telling me that they’re hungry and they want me to go home.” She stood. “Thanks  for the dinner, and the cocoa, and especially for the big sistering…”<p>
  “You’re more than welcome.” Kasumi said as she walked  Rei to the door. “I’m here anytime, dear.”<p>
  Rei smiled as she nodded and turned to head for home.  She wasn’t any less confused, but she felt better, and she felt secure that she  had a friend who understood.<p>
  That by itself was priceless…</p>
<p> * * * * *</p>
<p>Zhu Shu looked around the room, feeling like she had  truly come home. It was strange really, how much the Tendo’s house felt more  welcoming than her memories of her own home in her village. She hadn’t minded  staying at Rei’s for a few days, but being back was certainly a relief.<p>
  She noted Shan Pu’s rolled futon against the wall with  a smile. According to Akane and Ranma, Shan Pu had been trying to win her  fiancées in the straightforward manner of the cat she was.  She’d more or less done the same during their  travels to her. It hadn’t worked, but at least it seemed to have done no harm  either. She was going to have to teach her blood-sister the notion of subtlety.  Kasumi had made a suggestion along those lines, and the destroyed dojo out back  was the result. <p>
  That at least would be remedied by the time they came  back from China.  Nabiki had smiled at Tao-Ching and consented to a date after he’d offered to  have the dojo rebuilt.<p>
  All, in all, she was very glad to be back… even Soun’s  extravagant tears at dinner rejoicing that his adopted daughter had returned  had made her happy…<p>
  <em>Happy.</em><p>
  A small bubble of laughter escaped from her lips as  she realized that was indeed how she felt. The stress with Akane, while it  would never be gone, was livable now that they had resolved their relationship,  and without Akane’s feelings living in her head, she was at peace with being in  the same house with her.<p>
  Even her friendship with Ranma was fine. He didn’t  like her refusal to marry him, but he was willing to live with it, and to try  and make things work with Shan Pu… It might take him a while to learn to love the  Amazon, but she was confident he eventually would.<p>
  She’d even found an unexpected ally in Nodoka Saotome.  Ranma’s mother seemed happy with her son’s dual betrothal, and not all of her  reasons seemed to deal solely with the advantages to the Saotome family the  marriages would bring. Zhu Shu would almost think that Ranma’s having two  fiancées made Nodoka feel Ranma was incredibly manly… despite the fact that  he’d seemed to be more accepting of being female half the time since Akane had  seduced his female side.<p>
  Zhu Shu sat down on her futon and picked up the  picture of her and Kasumi kissing on the train. So much had happened since  then, and yet, so little time had passed. She sat the picture back down and  leaned back against the small mountain of stuffed animals she’d collected from  the various boys at Furinkan trying to date her, musing on how she might work  out the tangled love lives of her friends…<p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;And your own...&gt;&gt;</em><p>
  She smiled at the stray thought… it had almost sounded  like Ying-Ying... She reached back to the small strand of the connection they  had once shared and mentally caressed it. It was strange how much comfort that  small hint of her lost love could give.<p>
  She pulled out the scepter Luna had given her just a  few hours before and stared at it a long time. Why did it seem as if Luna  wanted her to be something more than she was? She didn’t know why she seemed to  have so much Silver Millennium energy, and she had no idea how to use it  either. She wasn’t a Senshi, or the reincarnated Empress… she was a <em>servant.</em><p>
  <em>&lt;&lt; As are all rulers… If they love  their subjects…&gt;&gt;</em><p>
  She shook her head, dismissing the notion. It was  simply too ridiculous. She tucked the scepter back behind her back.<p>
  A night breeze stole in through the windows, bringing  with it the scents of the flowers in the garden. She stood and stretched, then  stripped in preparation for bed. She stood in the window looking at the moon  for long moments and marveled. For all the distance she was from her home  village, the moon didn’t look any different. In a weeks time, it would be full,  like it had been that awful night… yet for the first time in four years, she  wasn’t dreading the anniversary of Ying-Ying’s death.<p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;I am here… I am always and  forever… here…&gt;&gt;</em><p>
  She lay down to sleep, touching with her mind the  links to her loves and let their warmth melt her into dreams…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Akane sat at her desk in her pajamas and played with  the pen Luna had given her. She wished she knew why the link with Zhu Shu had  changed her so much. True, most of the changes had been needed, and had made  her much happier, but stuff like this scared her. She wasn’t a Senshi… she  wasn’t a reincarnated warrior of some long forgotten kingdom and an age that  history had erased - she was a teenaged girl with fiancée problems. A future  husband who was also likely to be just as much a wife, an Amazon warrior who  seemed just as hot to fight her as to do other things, and a school full of  idiot hentai who would make her life sheer hell if they realized the full  ramifications of both…<p>
  How were her girl friends going to react when they  found out that she was going to be engaged to Shan Pu? How where they going to  act when they found out she was going to marry another girl?<p>
  She sighed as she put the pen away. It really wouldn’t  have been any different than how they would have reacted if she’d actually  gotten Zhu Shu to marry her. No, she had enough problems without the Senshi.  She stood and stretched as she looked out at the moon. Strange to think that  once, so long ago, there had been a Kingdom   of Justice and Love  there. She smiled as she recalled Usagi’s last training session. She was such a  klutz… but there really was something about her that just made you love her.  Like a puppy tripping over their tail…<p>
  She started as a flash of light lit up the sky for a  long moment in the direction of the Tokyo   Tower. That had been a  common occurrence of late. Sometimes, she would even think she saw things which  were obviously impossible - a side effect of what had happened between her and  Zhu Shu no doubt. So many faint tuggings in so many directions. She knew from  Zhu Shu’s memories she felt them too, but was so used to them, she ignored  them. Maybe she would eventually too, but sometimes, it felt like a storm was  brewing while the sky was completely clear.<p>
  The light faded, along with the feeling of an  intangible wind blowing in that direction. It was disconcerting to say the  least.<p>
  Strange thing was, she felt the same thing around Rei  too… like the girl was the source of the wind she couldn’t quit feel… and  around Zhu Shu even more strongly.<p>
  She shook her head. It had been too long a day. She  pulled the curtains closed and lay down on the bed.<p>
  Before her head hit the pillow, she was asleep.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ami poured over the logs on her computer yet again. It  was very strange…<p>
  During the battle with the creature, the small  computer had been taking readings and now that she had had time to study them,  it became obvious that more had been going on that night than they had been  aware of.<p>
  The fight had started late evening, accompanied by a  massive surge of negative magical energy… only part of which had been centered  in the creature that had attacked… they had been so busy fighting that she’d  never had the chance to realize that a much larger surge had built far to the  east - somewhere in the United States. Then several hours later, when they had  been too exhausted for anyone to notice, the surge had moved to somewhere  southwest of them, near Hong Kong, and the power levels had grown enormously, a  spike of gigantic proportions that had then reached a peak and fell, leaving  several smaller spikes that had died down. Much of it had been outside of her  computers exact range and only detectable by it’s sheer strength.<p>
  Obviously, something hugely magical had happened… something  that probably didn’t bode well for whoever had been involved… but so far, none  of it had affected Japan… or seemed directly tied to the Senshi yet.<p>
  It had been so quiet since they had defeated the  Doomtree… could this be a sign something new was about to come?<p>
  She closed up the computer as she yawned. Tomorrow she  had to be up early to study for a mid morning test. Hopefully, nothing more  difficult would pop up.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The masked man stood on the balcony looking like the  epitome of a Chinese sorcerer. Even Herb felt intimidated by the cold feeling  the wizard seemed to exude. She looked to Lime and Mint, the pair of them  looking a little downcast and jubilant at the same time. They were happy that  they would be leading the little excursion to the Amazon village, but were sad  they wouldn’t be joining Herb in going to Japan. Still, the thought of  getting to fight the Amazons - and maybe even getting to do… <em>other</em> things - had excited them. The  sorcerer had been generous in supplying men and had bolstered the few remaining  troops of the Musk with well trained soldiers.<p>
  They were a far cry from Musk warriors, true, but  manpower was manpower, especially against the Amazons. Herb had read too many  tales of the Musk’s dealings with those… <em>creatures</em>…  to expect the fight to be easy, even with the magical aid the sorcerer Xi’an  Chi had promised.<p>
  Still… it was a small price to pay for the means to  find the <em>Kaisufuu</em>.<p>
  “Everything is in readiness Xi’an Chi,” Herb said. “I  leave in the morning with my escort. Mint and Lime will lead the assault on the  village in two days. The flasks are all filled and waiting on the wagons. We  will achieve our revenge easily.”<p>
  The man turned ice cold eyes to Herb. “I pray it will  be so your Highness. I have learned to never take things for granted where the  Song are concerned.” His voice was differential, but Herb had no doubt who  really ruled the Musk for the moment. The sorcerer had been true to his word  and forged the alliance, but in some ways, Herb feared she had made a grave mistake.<p>
  But one that could be remedied once she had resolved  her little problem and had her full powers back. For now, she needed the  manpower Xi’an Chi brought.<p>
  And Mint and Lime? Well…she would teach them a lesson  when she returned… show them both what a real man was supposed to do with a  harem full of women. The troops with Xi’an Chi had been quick to introduce the  pair to the pleasures women offered… Herb had refrained… for now.  But once this little problem was fixed…<p>
  Xi’an Chi’s cold eyes lit with a faint tinge of  amusement. Herb’s eyes narrowed. Allowing her mind to drift was inexcusable.  Still… she could get some faint hint of revenge. “I am not concerned with the  Song, Xi’an Chi. The false Dragon’s Child is yours to do with as you will. I am  the only true Dragon’s child, and I will rule all of China, if I must slaughter all who  oppose me.” She turned back to the throne room, her cloak swirling. “Leave me  now. I must prepare for tomorrows departure.”<p>
  Xi’an Chi’s eyes glittered at his dismissal, but he smiled  coldly as he bowed and left, trailed by Mint and Lime. Herb stood alone in the  throne room and pulled open her top to stare down at her breasts. “I will break  this curse, Xi’an  Chi. Then when I’m a man again, we’ll see who really rules…”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The masked man strode out of the castle to the waiting  helicopter. As he approached, a shadowy figure stepped out of the interior. He  stopped and addressed the form. “Herb leaves in the morning. You know what to  do.”<p>
  “And the Musk?”<p>
  Xi’an Chi laughed. “They were amusing toys. Herb’s two  lieutenants were easy to seduce with a few spells and their own lusts. They  will make an interesting experiment. It matters not whether Herb finds the <em>Kaisufuu</em> or not, I have made her  condition permanent. It will be interesting to see how she fares once returning  to her friends still female. I wonder how long it will be before they make her  forget she was ever male?”<p>
  A thin sliver of white was the only indication the  shadowy figure was smiling. “Truly an interesting study, Master.”<p>
  Xi’an Chi nodded. “I must be away to Hong   Kong. Events there can not be put off for this amusement any  longer. Bring me the Heir once she is caught. I have many other interesting  experiments I wish to try.”<p>
  “Of course, Master.”<p>
  The old man turned just as he entered the black  copter. “Do not fail. Or you may end up being my experiment.”<p>
  The shadowy figure bowed, then seemed to fade into the  dark. The rotors of the copter picked up speed and the strangely insectoid  appearing craft lifted off to vanish into the night.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Dawn came to Nerima bright and early. Ranma woke to  the faint sounds of two sets of swords chiming faintly in a pattern almost too  fast to follow. He peeked out the window to see Akane and Zhu Shu practicing in  the early morning light, their swords moving in intricate dances that formed  hypnotic rhythms. He smiled as he realized they were up so early because  neither one was dressed and the dojo had not yet been rebuilt. He tiptoed out  of the room and out to the garden.<p>
  At the edge of the koi pond, he reached down into the  water and splashed himself, then went around the house to the practice yard,  stripping to stand on a rock by the edge of the match area and waited. After a  few seconds, the blurs resolved themselves into the pair of fencers. “Yes,  Ranma?” Akane asked.<p>
  The redhead bowed. “Would you care to spar?”<p>
  Zhu Shu smiled. That was something she had been hoping  to happen for a while now. Ranma wouldn’t fight anyone she didn’t consider an  equal in skill, unless attacked, and Akane had been so far below her skill  level she wouldn’t even consider <em>really</em> sparring with her… but in his stubborn, macho way, he had passed it off as “I  don’t fight girls.” thinking that Akane, independent spirit that she was, would  just accept it. That she was actually asking Akane to spar was a BIG leap.<p>
  Zhu Shu stepped to the side and toweled off as the two  faced each other. Akane took a stance, her swords trembling slightly. Ranma  gave her a “come on” with her forward hand.<p>
  Akane blurred as she attempted to catch Ranma off  guard, and her attempt to wrap her ribbons around the other girl failed.  She looked down at the red-head, grinning at  her as she held the ribbons taut.<p>
  “I’ve been watching Zhu-chan for months now,  Akane.  I thought I figured out how she  did that.  Looks like I’m right, huh.”<p>
  Akane smiled.   “I guess.”<p>
  Akane launched herself into a spinning attack that  Ranma dodged by flipping over, then blocked Ranma’s return kick. Satisfied that  the pair were having fun, Zhu Shu finished toweling the sweat off, then used  the kettle of hot water she had brought out. She had wanted to see how the  changes in her chi had affected her in both normal and cursed forms, and was  vastly relived that there seemed little difference physically. Once more her normal  self, she monitored the two as she performed her routine forms, admiring how  beautiful they both were as they danced through attack and counter attack.  She found herself thinking about how Rei had  looked when she had faced the creature, and how nice her body had felt as she  had pressed against her during her henshin.<p>
  She noticed what she was doing and laughed softly to  herself.  Daydreaming about Rei while  watching Akane.  Maybe there was hope for  her yet.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Urd looked down on the three practicing from her perch  in a bird’s nest and worried. Things were not going they way they should.<p>
  She hadn’t worried about Zhu Shu’s initial refusal to  Ranma, confident the mix of emotions she had gotten from Akane would drive her  to him eventually, but Zhu Shu’s death and the subsequent revelation that she  was the Child of the Dragon had shocked her. Then Zhu Shu’s resurrection by the  Old Woman had added far more complications.   And that damn program in Yggdrasil wasn’t being forthcoming.  How the damn thing knew all of her tricks…  she sighed went back to observing Zhu Shu.<p>
  As far as she could tell, someone… or something, had  altered Belldandy’s spell on Zhu Shu. Not removed it… altered it. Belldandy was  much better at spells than she, so she couldn’t make out exactly what had been  done, but it seemed to have removed the emotional crossover of the spell from  just Zhu Shu.<p>
  That had to be the Dragon’s handiwork.<p>
  She watched Ranma catch Akane’s ribbon and spin her  across the yard.  He was like a computer  when it came to learning new martial arts. She shook her head before laying  back in the nest to figure out what to do next.<p>
  There was more going on here than just her test, there  had to be. She was running into too many stonewalls and barriers for a normal  wish. The Ultimate Force itself should have overcome many of the obstacles she  had encountered, yet it hadn’t. Yggdrasil had so many blind or password  protected files that what she had learned amounted to a small fraction of what  she needed to know. She’d found enough to suspect she had gone back in time to  arrange for the loophole in the Amazon laws, and evidence that she’d arranged  other things, but no indication of what.   And it was all so covert that she had to wonder if <em>Kami-Sama</em> really had approved it.<p>
  It was infuriating. And if, as she suspected, the  Dragon was running his own game with her test as well, it only made it worse.<p>
  What was that inscrutable overgrown lizard up to? She  had never been able to figure out why Kami-sama gave Legend such respect. He  wasn’t part of the pantheon, but her father respected him like he did no others  in Asgard.   According to Phoenixmoon,  until she had entered her password, only Kami-Sama and the Dragon had known of  it’s existence, yet it had given her frustratingly little hard information. <p>
  But… she couldn’t shake this sense of urgency to her  test, like everyone was waiting with baited breath to see if she succeeded or  failed. And Mara…<p>
  The bird whose nest she had borrowed returned and  scolded her out of it’s home as Zhu Shu, Akane, and Ranma finished up their  practice and headed into the house before anyone else woke up. She hopped down  and snuck into the house after them, headed for the living room and the TV. She  needed to talk to Kami-Sama.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Breakfast went normally, or at least as normally as it  did at the Tendo dojo. Kasumi and Zhu Shu worked at getting breakfast on the  table as Akane, Nabiki and Ranma prepared for school. Nodoka, who had come by  early, took the opportunity to quiz Zhu Shu about her son and how he had  behaved himself since she met him. Zhu Shu told her about the misadventures in China, and some  of the problems Ranma had had in Japan with his curse.  Nodoka smiled approvingly at how he had tried  his best to live with it.<p>
  Ryouga wandered in about midway through the free for  all with a new flower for Kasumi. She smiled at the dancing bellflower as it  wavered back and forth on the table and thanked the lost boy for such an  unusual gift. Ryouga blushed as he stammered it was nothing, pointedly not mentioning  the thin slashes he had gotten when the plant had launched a flight of razor  sharp leaves at him. Or the shocking he’d gotten when he’d dived out of the way  and landed on a large yellow rat.<p>
  Akane smiled at her big sister as she accepted the  dancing flower. It was getting more and more obvious everyday that Ryouga was  smitten with her. Then she noticed as Kasumi gave Ryouga a extra large helping  of fish cakes. Kasumi may not have made up her mind romantically, but Akane was  certain she did like the lost boy.<p>
  Zhu Shu watched the exchange and wondered if she  should inform Ryouga that he might want to not stammer and stutter so much  around Kasumi if he really wanted to get her to like him… after all, that was  one of the things about Doctor Tofu that Kasumi found so discouraging. She  watched as Ryouga tried to jump up to help Kasumi clear away the table, only to  step on the root of the dancing flower, get hit by a spray of leaves and fall  into the koi pond. Shaking her head, she picked up her books to follow the  others out as they headed for school.<p>
  Ryouga followed them out only to find himself nose to  nose with a very large saber tooth cat who was having his ears scratched by  Nabiki. His eyes grew very wide as the cat opened jaws bigger than he was and  let out a loud bhweee before Nabiki smacked the cat upside the head.<p>
  “Behave Tao-Ching. That’s your cousin! No eating him!”<p>
  The big cat gave the piglet the eye and an evil grin,  then shrugged. He scratched out a few kanji symbols that spelled “Just kidding”  before nudging Nabiki to mount up.<p>
  The trip to school was fairly uneventful, Zhu Shu’s  umbrella intercepting the splash from the little old lady watering the  sidewalk, predictably diverting it onto Ranma. The red-haired girl merely  shrugged philosophically and trudged on along the fence top.<p>
  At the gate, a Kuno awaited. Tatewaki was nowhere to  be seen, but Kodachi was more than willing to make up for his absence…<p>
  “My Goddess! At last you have arrived! But allow me  give you this token of my worship!” She knelt and handed Akane a bouquet of  black roses. Akane carefully took them and aimed them at Kodachi’s enraptured  face. A cloud of white powder exploded into the worshipful girls face and she  flushed, a look of pure desire lighting her eyes.<p>
  Akane took off, a lustful Kodachi in hot pursuit. Zhu  Shu shook her head.<p>
  “More things change, more stay same.” she muttered.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Nabiki whistled happily as she wandered towards her  homeroom, idly listening to the sounds of Kodachi pursuing Akane through the  school. She had enjoyed riding to school on Tao-Ching’s back as he purred and  sauntered. The older Hibiki was trying his best to be charming, and she had to  admit, it was working.<p>
  She took the three separate reports from her factors  and glanced through them, her thoughts more on Tao-Ching than on the reports  until she came to a flag.<p>
  She paid more attention to the report as she noted  what her factor had wanted to call to her attention. The five girls she had  been asked to look up had a penchant for missing school on the same day,  despite the fact they went to three separate schools.<p>
  Nabiki flipped to one of the other reports, and  quickly cross-referenced the dates. They all coincided with reported Senshi  battles.<p>
  She flipped through the third and found pictures of Zhu  Shu and Rei dining at the Ginza, and one of  Zhu Shu taking Rei up the sides of the strip.<p>
  Sailor Mars had been the first to arrive.<p>
  She dropped the folders into the shredder she had in  her locker for just such situations and nodded. She had enough proof. So what  to do now?<p>
  Memories of how she felt that night, watching as  Akane, Ranma and Shan Pu disappeared into the dark returned to her, and she  decided that for now, she wouldn’t do anything.<p>
  But if they endangered her sisters again…<p>
  Her thought was broken off as she entered homeroom.<p>
  “Nabiki Tendo. I have been awaiting you.” a hoarse  voice said from under heavy bandages.<p>
  “Kuno baby! I thought you were still in the hospital!”<p>
  “A thousand foul blows from that treacherous Saotome  cannot lay Tatewaki Kuno low.”<p>
  “I thought Kodachi did that to you, Kuno baby. All  those head smashes must have addled your memory again.”<p>
  “My fair sister hath been bespelled by that vile  sorcerer. T’was he who controlled her. That is why I have awaited you. I must  know how this evil enchantment may be ended.”<p>
  Nabiki blinked, then did a mental shrug. Kuno would  never just accept the truth. She’d tried explaining to him about Ranma before  and had gotten nowhere. No matter what she said, he’d find a way to twist it  into his little fantasy world<p>
  Still… this was Kuno… and she needed a little extra  cash.<p>
  She motioned Kuno over to a corner, rolling her eyes  as he attempted to sneak inconspicuously in a well lit and crowded room and  whispered “I fear you are correct in believing Kodachi is bespelled, however,  Ranma is not the source of this foul deed. I know of someone I could obtain the  information of whom has cast this vile spell, but I fear I lack the price he  has asked.”<p>
  Kuno bought it hook line and sinker. “Ah, what a vile  creature this must be to desire money for such information! To stand in the way  of justice for gold! Yea, though it doth offend my noble soul at the thought, I  doth posses the coin with which to pay this blood price. Tell me, Nabiki Tendo,  what the miscreant demands!”<p>
  “20,000 yen.” Nabiki said. That should cover the cost  of her new CD player and a few CDs.<p>
  Kuno grimaced. “I have not that much in cash.”<p>
  Nabiki held out the card reader from her notebook.  “Major credit cards accepted.”<p>
  Kuno’s face lit up as he pulled out a credit card and  ran it through the reader.<p>
  Nabiki smiled. “Meet me at the tree after school, and  I will tell you what I’ve learned.” That should give her plenty of time to  create a wild goose chase for the rich idiot.<p>
  Kuno nodded and wandered to his chair just as the bell  rang…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“I’m telling you, I don’t know what it was exactly.  It’s just that it was so powerful my computer could detect it from Japan, and the  main surge was in Hong Kong.” Ami told Makoto  and Usagi for the fifth time.<p>
  Usagi poked her nose into Ami’s bento, in hopes that  maybe there’d be something there, having already devoured her lunch. “So you  aren’t sure if it’s some new enemy?” She asked, frowning at the empty box.<p>
  “I don’t have enough information to figure it out  either way.” Ami said.<p>
  Makoto moved her bento further away as Usagi looked at  it hungrily. “I wonder what it was. And if it had any connection to what  happened here?”<p>
  Ami closed the small notebook computer. “I don’t know.  So far it hasn’t repeated itself. I set the computer up to signal me if it  detects a similar spike though.” She looked down. “That’s funny. I could have  sworn I brought an apple.”<p>
  Usagi quickly hid the apple core behind her back, “So,  what do you think is up with Rei?” she asked to distract the smaller girl.<p>
  “Humm.” Ami blinked. “I don’t think anything’s up with  her, Usagi. She’s felt responsible for Zhu Shu ever since we first met her. Her  getting killed like that just upset her a lot. Now that Zhu Shu’s alright, I’m  sure she’ll be fine soon.”<p>
  “Yeah, after all, Rei gets along with Zhu Shu much  better than she does the rest of us.” Makoto added.<p>
  “I get along with Rei!” Usagi protested.<p>
  “Oh course you do, Usagi. That’s why you two fight all  the time.” Makoto rolled her eyes. “Give me a break, Usagi-chan. Rei’s a nice  girl, and so are you, but you two get on each others nerves.”<p>
  Usagi stuck out her tongue. “Say, you gonna eat those  chips?”<p>
  Makoto laughed. “Well I was… but we can’t have our  illustrious leader dying of starvation, can we?”<p>
  Usagi gave her a haughty look. “Of course not.”<p>
  Ami looked pensively off into space. “I can’t say I  blame Rei for being worried though. Zhu-sensei may have strangely high levels  of Millennium energy, but she’s shown no indication she has any type of Senshi  powers. I’m worried something like the Doomtree might be a danger to her.”<p>
  Makoto nodded. “Yeah, Usagi. We’re the ones who’ve  chosen to face those kinds of dangers. Zhu Shu may support us and teach us, but  she shouldn’t have to fight our battles just because she’s our friend. We  should have found a way to fight that creature. She shouldn’t have had to  sacrifice herself to save us.”<p>
  Usagi blinked. “Umm… well… what do you want me to do  about it?”<p>
  “We just need to keep Zhu-sensei safe.” Ami said.<p>
  “So we just keep her out of Senshi stuff. That’s  easy.” Usagi mumbled around a mouthful of potato chips.<p>
  Ami and Makoto exchanged a glance. They weren’t so  sure it would be <em>that</em> easy…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Nabiki looked through the contents of the email again,  feeling her stomach sink. She’d gotten the message just as lunch began, from a  contact who had an uncle in the Yakuza, and she was less than thrilled at what  her inquiry had revealed.<p>
  All in all, it was a polite response from the uncle,  that essentially said she shouldn’t pursue the line of inquiry. The uncle would  overlook the request this time because his niece had asked him too, but that he  would not be so lenient next time.<p>
  However, he had answered her question even while  seeming to have refused her completely. It was pretty clever actually, and had  undoubtedly been done to cover himself in case his superiors intercepted the  email. It’s just the answer wasn’t one she had wanted to hear.<p>
  The email contained the three photos she had lifted  from the police database of the “muggers” that had attacked Zhu Shu and Kasumi.  Added to the photos was the names of all three, and the ominous title “Tong  assassin, Clan Scorpion.”<p>
  The warning message the Uncle had sent told her to not  make inquires as to Clan Scorpion’s activities, as such inquires were as  unwelcome as inquires into the “Families” business. It also included the  passports for all three, showing they had come from Hong   Kong… The island   of Lan Tao specifically.<p>
  Needless to say, the email had not made her very  happy.<p>
  A shadow fell across her, making her jump.<p>
  “Girl say Nabiki wish see Zhu Shu?”<p>
  Nabiki placed her hand on her heart, trying to make  the hammering stop.<p>
  “God’s, Zhu Shu, don’t sneak up on people like that!”<p>
  “Zhu Shu sorry. No mean to sneak.”<p>
  Nabiki patted the bench next to her. “Please sit. I  have to talk to you.”<p>
  The Chinese girl sat and tilted her head curiously.  “What may do?”<p>
  Nabiki took a deep breath. “First, please be careful.  And if you must help out Rei and the other Senshi in a fight, please DON’T  change first. Your cursed form is just a little to much of a stand out to keep  secret.”<p>
  Zhu Shu raised an eyebrow. “So, Nabiki know.”<p>
  “I figured it out, yes. I would assume Akane probably  knows as well. Don’t worry. I won’t tell anyone that you were on a date with  Sailor Mars, just please be careful.” She took another deep breath. “Which  brings me to my second problem.”<p>
  Zhu Shu raised her eyebrow higher.<p>
  Nabiki looked her square in the eye. “Can you give me  any reason why the Scorpion Tong would want you dead?”<p>
  Light dawned in Zhu Shu’s eyes. “Clan Scorpion… That  explain much Zhu Shu not understand.”<p>
  “Care to enlighten me?” Nabiki prompted.<p>
  Zhu Shu looked off into space. “Zhu Shu remember  Grandfather tell tales of Clan Scorpion. Long ago they war with Clan Dragon.  They kill many ancestors. Grandfathers grandfather fight many time. Clan Dragon  once have many enemy. Clan Scorpion, Musk Dynasty, Shadowkhan. All from old  tales. Zhu Shu not know such still exist.” She shook her head. “Clan Dragon  barely survive enemies. Sad that enemies still see as threat. Zhu Shu is last  Dragon. If no heir, Clan dies with her.” She looked at Nabiki with a  penetrating look, golden eyes seeming to see right through her. “<em>Clan Dragon</em> <em>must</em> <em>not die</em>.”<p>
  Nabiki looked away, unable to meet those eyes, but  when she looked back, Zhu Shu’s eyes were once more their normal jade green.  Nabiki swallowed hard, then decided it must have been a trick of the light.<p>
  “I don’t know what Clan Scorpion wants with you  Zhu-chan, but Dad thinks of you as a daughter, and well… if you tell anyone  this, I’ll have to strangle you, but I care about you like a sister. I’ll see  what else I can find out. All I know now is that the three you dealt with were  from Hong Kong.”<p>
  “Nabiki should not endanger self for Zhu Shu.”<p>
  Nabiki laughed. “I won’t. I have too much respect for  an intact skin to put myself in harm’s way.” She closed the notebook, and  looked down at her unopened bento. “Well, I guess I should eat. Care to join me  for lunch?”<p>
  Zhu Shu eyed the boxed lunch and reached behind her  back to pull out her small grill. “Only if let Zhu Shu cook…”<p>
  Nabiki handed her the bento. “You’re on. Kasumi’s a  great cook, but it tastes so much better hot.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Urd was diffident as she walked up the carpet to stand  on the balcony under the Throne. Being before her father tended to make  everyone but her brother Thor humble.<p>
  “I cannot give you the answers you seek, Urd.”  Kami-sama said before she had a chance to ask. “You must find them on your own,  daughter. Those are the conditions of the test.”<p>
  “B-but Sir! Every time I turn around this test grows  harder! This one wish has escalated into a web of conditions and entanglements  that one goddess simply can’t handle!”<p>
  “I have faith in you Urd.” Kami-sama said simply.<p>
  “But how can I pass this test when I don’t even  understand it anymore? The Ultimate Force seems to have suspended itself, and  everywhere I turn I find things I had once thought true are but misdirection  and lies. I am the Goddess of the Past, yet history itself has been denied me!  How can I do anything if the truth is hidden from me. Why all the smoke and  fog? You tell me to grant Shan Pu’s wish, yet the fact that her blood-sister  was the Dragon’s Child was hidden from me. My own records have been sealed  against me by myself from the future, and my efforts have been undermined. How  can anyone be expected to succeed a test like this?”<p>
  “You must Urd. The conditions for this test were set  before you were born, and they are fair, though that may not seem true to you.  You are the only one who may resolve this challenge. I cannot aid you.”<p>
  “Why me?!!”<p>
  A chill laughter echoed through the throne room,  sending a shiver through Urd’s spine. “Because <em>that </em>is what was agreed upon, <em>Daughter</em>.”<p>
  Urd turned as a tall, beautiful woman with almost  luminous pale skin and white hair stepped onto the balcony. A cold aura  surrounded her and the jet black stars on her cheeks and forehead looked like  bottomless abyss’s against her white skin.<p>
  Only one demon was allowed in Kami-Sama presence, and  she had just called Urd her daughter. The words echoed over and over in her  head, and no matter how much she wanted to deny them, she knew they were true.<p>
  “Hild.” Kami-Sama acknowledged. “You are forbidden to  interfere in Urd’s test either.”<p>
  Chill laughter echoed once again. “Interfere? I? I’m  merely here to make sure that your ‘Fatherly love’ doesn’t cause you to  overstep.”<p>
  Kami-Sama’s blue eye fixed the goddess of death with a  penetrating stare. “Be careful Hild. The test is not finished. The decision has  not yet been made.” He said ominously. “I yet abide by my oath.”<p>
  The tall woman walked around Urd, giving her a look  like a snake sizing up a mouse. “Yes…” She stopped in front of Urd. “I was <em>so</em> disappointed, daughter, when you  chose to side with these <em>pitiful</em> do-gooders. I so looked forward to educating you on how to be a proper demon.”  She smiled, her teeth showing at the corners of her mouth. “Well, I’m sure I’ll  have you under my wing soon enough.” She laughed as Urd finally broke and ran…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Nabiki sat beneath her tree at the end of the day,  waiting for Kuno. She had worried all afternoon about what to tell him, and had  finally settled on a story which would keep him busy, and maybe, just maybe,  protect Zhu Shu and Akane from his romantic attentions - at least for awhile - while  still allowing her to capitalize on his obsession.<p>
  Predictably, Kuno contrived to arrive with the sun  behind him. “Nabiki Tendo. I have come as promised to hear thy tidings. Pray  tell me the name of this vile sorcerer who hath enchanted mine sister, and how  this foul spell may be broken.”<p>
  Nabiki stood and played to Kuno’s sense of drama by  clasping her hands before her and mimicking his speech. “Oh, Kuno. I have  indeed tidings of a most dire nature, and I fear for you should you seek to act  on that which I shall tell you. This enchantment is indeed the work of a most <em>vile</em> and <em>evil</em> wizard. This hideous beast is an ancient and wicked man who  has destroyed many lives for his twisted amusement, yet I fear his bewitchment  of your sister is but the first step of a plot against you, oh noble samurai.”<p>
  Kuno was mesmerized. “Against I? Why would - Nay! Am I  not Blue Thunder? Am I not the finest swordsman in all Japan? He must  know he wouldst need to best me ere his foul plots could succeed!”<p>
  Nabiki managed to keep a straight face. “Indeed, for  you are to be the champion of the one he doth desire to posses above all  others. ‘T’was for <em>her</em> sake that you  have received the enmity of this wizard, and your fair sister hath been  bewitched!”<p>
  Kuno stood straight and tall, his conception of a  noble samurai receiving his quest. “Tell me, fair Nabiki, who is this wondrous  maiden who is threatened. I must hurry to her forthwith to offer her the  protection of my sword, and to smite her foes!”<p>
  Oops… better nip <em>that</em> in the bud. “Nay! If you reveal to her your mission, it will surely fail, and  you shall gain naught. You must be her <em>secret</em> defender. You must watch o’er her and bide your time until the sorcerer grows  bold enough to reveal himself, believing you to be no longer a threat, then you  must strike without mercy!”<p>
  Kuno’s eyes shone with righteous enthusiasm. “I shall!  But name to me this wondrous maiden who doth so need my sword arm!”<p>
  “’Tis Zhu Shu, thy classmate.”<p>
  “My fair forest goddess! Ah what vileness must rest  within this fiends heart that he would threaten such pure and wondrous beauty!”<p>
  Nabiki avoided the laugh that wanted to erupt. “Aye!  And if you would protect her, you <em>must</em> pretend to have no interest, for if the sorcerer does see you vie for her hand,  he will never reveal himself. Nor must you show your love for my sister Akane,  or he will surely try to use your heart against you!” There. That should handle  two birds with one stone.<p>
  Kuno wept. “Verily, ‘twill be the hardest task I have  ever set myself, yet for their sake, and the sake of the love I bear them, I  shall!”<p>
  “You must, or all is lost, for only with the defeat of  this sorcerer will the spell o’er your sister be weakened enough to allow the  cure to be applied.”<p>
  “Thou hast news of that as well? Tell me!”<p>
  “Only the kiss of her one true love will break the  spell that binds her, and that only once the sorcerer has been laid low.”<p>
  “Kodachi has kissed many boys, and she loves each with  all her heart. ‘Twill be an easy spell to break.” Kuno stated with a nod.<p>
  “Nay. It must be the kiss of one who doth truly love <em>her</em>.”<p>
  Kuno paled. “Oh, how cruel are the fates, that my  sister must forever suffer this vile curse! Yet even I cannot go against the  will of the Gods! I must acknowledge the cruel fact that my sister shall never  be free, yet for this, the foul villain will pay most dearly!”<p>
  Nabiki blinked. “You’re just giving up on her?”<p>
  Kuno lowered his eyes from heaven to look at her.  “Nabiki, thou knowest not my sister.”<p>
  To that, Nabiki had no answer.</p>

<p>Mara could feel the situation slipping out of her  control.<p>
  She hadn’t rested all week, not since the night of Zhu  Shu’s death and revival. Learning that Zhu Shu was Legend’s Child had been her  first sign of the disaster she’d created for herself. The Dragon wasn’t bound  to the doublet system that held between Asgard and Nifelheim. She’d expected at  any time to turn around and see the jaws of the Dragon closing on her for  causing Zhu Shu’s death. She still did.<p>
  But she was still alive. Only her carefully woven  plots were dying, but not quickly enough. Xi’an Chi was ignoring all her  attempts to call off the attack in China, Herb had been shielded against her  scrying and she had barely escaped the abomination the old wizard had left in  charge in China when she had attempted to call it off in person.  Somehow, she had grievously underestimated  the powers of the wizard, and had found herself powerless to defend herself  against the shadow beast that had spouted an endless stream of rock and roll  music. <p>
  Fool she was, but she now knew why the wizard wanted  the <em>Dragon’s</em> Heir.<p>
  So she sat and watched as her carefully engineered  plans unraveled themselves, knowing she was doomed.<p>
  What had she been thinking? She had never been so  vicious, so… <em>driven.</em><p>
  If only Urd hadn’t…<p>
  The footstep was faint, but in her present state of  paranoia, Mara reacted.  She spun, energy  balls ready to blast the intruder, when black lightning hurled her against the  wall and pinned her there. Through eyes barely able to see from the agony, Mara  watched as Hild sauntered up to her and allowed the lightning streaming from  her hand to cease. Mara fell to the ground in a heap, gasping for air as she  vainly tried to move. A hand wrapped itself in her hair and drew her up to  dangle a foot off the ground.<p>
  “Mara, Mara, Mara. What <em>ever</em> am I to do with you?”<p>
  “M-mistress?” Mara’s whisper was agonized.<p>
  “Here you are, a Demon First Class, Unlimited, and you  can’t even handle the foiling of one goddess on probation? And to find out you  tried to stop one of your own plots? Are you trying to stop Armageddon?” A  casual flick tossed Mara against the wall again.<p>
  Mara tried to breathe. “B-but the D-Dragon…”<p>
  “What care <em>I</em> for the plans of the Dragon? He is old and feeble and senile. So his child is  part of the All-Father’s game. I care not! I have been content to let you play  with my daughter so far, but she is succeeding! I will not have that, Mara! Urd  must fail this test or all I have worked for these millennia will be for  naught! I have planned for Ragnarok for too long to allow your ineptness to  ruin everything!”<p>
  The lightning bolt that erupted from her hand flung  Mara against the wall spread eagled as slivers of wood wrenched free from the  floor and speared through her wrists. Mara screamed.<p>
  “I had such <em>hope</em> for you, Mara. Your anger after the Fenrir affair was <em>perfect</em>, all it needed was a little push to make it an obsession.  But all you have done is <em>fail!</em>” Hild  stepped up to her and ripped open her blouse, making Mara scream again as she  was pulled against the spears in her wrists. Blood trickled down from where  she’d bitten her lip, making a trail that Hild’s fingernail traced down her  breast bone. Then, she set her nails over Mara’s heart, the points drawing  blood.<p>
  “One last chance Mara. If I am forced to return, I  will rip out your heart. That would be a pity, since you once showed such  promise.” Hild kissed her as her nails dug deeper, then she released the barely  conscious demoness.<p>
  “My daughter must not complete her test if Ragnarok is  to come. Succeed, and I will give her to you as you desire. Fail me again…” She  left the threat hanging as she turned away and faded into the shadows beyond  the door.<p>
  Mara let out a sob when her mistress had gone, and in  a miserable whisper said to the air. “Forgive me, Urd. I never desired Ragnarok…”  She closed her eyes and tried to believe the damage Hild had done her was fatal  as she cried.<p>
  It had been a game. She had always been a rival with  Urd in school, as well as best friends, but she was a demon, and Urd had chosen  to be a goddess. She had felt betrayed by that choice, and had done everything  she could to foil the three sisters, short of anything that would actually <em>hurt</em> them… despite it all, they were  still her childhood friends…<p>
  Even after Urd had been possessed by the Master of  Terror, freed by Mara’s own hand, she had tried to keep the destruction down,  until Urd had ordered her to give all her energy to Fenrir. Now she could see  how Hild had taken her anger and used it to drive her crazy…<p>
  But she didn’t want the world to end, she just wanted  her friend back…<p>
  Hild had hurt her just enough to ensure obedience.  Mara could free herself from the wall, at the cost of enormous pain, and Hild  knew once she had, she would be broken, willing to do whatever it took to avoid  a repeat lesson. Only death would free her from Hild’s leash.<p>
  She would be forced to destroy the only person she had  ever…<p>
  A golden light poured into the room and Mara opened  her eyes. Salvation had come.<p>
  She laughed as the Dragon opened his jaws.</p>
