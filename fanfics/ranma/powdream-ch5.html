--------------------------------------------------------------------

Why?

Why was it so hard to get his head around this?

The three girls that were betrothed to him, now proven to love him
equally, were to make things even more complicated, as much
in love with each other.

And now finally, marriage was on the cards. But how could he?
How could he marry three girls? How could he possibly care for all
of them at once?

Only one thing prevented Ranma from cracking up, and that was his training.
Ever since Shampoo and Akane visited him the dojo earlier, he had been
training, non-stop, pushing himself to the very edge of pain, fighting.

He barely even noticed the intruder, who now somehow entered through the
roof. He dropped down to the dojo floor, and now it could be seen, that it 
was
Ryoga.

&quot;SAOTOME!!!!!&quot; He yelled at the top of his voice. &quot;I CHALLENGE YOU!!!&quot;
Ranma ignores him, and continues fighting with a training pole.
&quot;I know all about this wedding. I CAN&#39;T LET YOU HAVE HER!! Akane is mine!
I will fight you for her!&quot;

Still, his threats were ignored. Ryoga now takes a fighting pose.

&quot;This will be a fight to the death. The winner will take Akane&#39;s hand.
Even if you ignore me, I will fight you! I will win her, or I will die
trying!! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!&quot;

Ryoga runs head first at Ranma in a battle charge, but the martial artist
saw this coming well in advance, and with a sigh of apathy he takes a
side-step to the left avoiding Ryoga, allowing the pigboy to hit the
training pole head-first. Ryoga is knocked out-cold and falls to the ground
uncerimoniously.

&quot;I&#39;m not in the mood to beat you today. Go home.&quot; Murmered Ranma while he
continued his training. Just then, his father enters the dojo.

&quot;Ranma, there you are. I&#39;ve been looking for you.&quot;

&quot;Yes, what is it?&quot; He said as he continued training.

&quot;I would like you to go to Ukyo&#39;s shop and bring Nabiki home. While you are
at it, check up on Akane.&quot;

Ryoga suddenly regains consciousness and jumps to his feet.
&quot;Akane?! *I* will take Tendo-san&#39;s daughter home for you! And while I&#39;m at 
it,
I will keep an eye on Akane. Keep an eye on her in Ukyo&#39;s bedroom. Keep an
eye on her with her lesbain girlfriends. Keep an eye on her while they are
naked and rubbing eachother in-&quot;

&quot;Ranma-&quot; Butted in Genma with a stern voice. &quot;Don&#39;t let this directionally
challenged freak anywhere near Ukyo&#39;s room, or my future daughter-in-law.&quot;

&quot;Hmm....&quot; Mused Ryoga. &quot;I get the feeling that you father doesn&#39;t like me
that much Ranma.&quot;

&quot;Really Ryoga? You&#39;re a living Sherlock Holmes, you know that?
Now get the hell out of our dojo!&quot; Yelled Ranma as he proceeded to push the
cursed boy out of the room.

&quot;Give my regards to Akane&#39;s father!!&quot; Yelled Ryoga as he was about to be
pushed out onto the street.

=============================================================================
[1]==========================================================================
=============================================================================

The darkness of the night had set in and the two figures of Ranma and Ryoga
cut throught the light of the lampposts on Nerima&#39;s main street.

&quot;Go home Pig-boy!!&quot; Snapped a now peeved Ranma who had been followed by the
boy for the past 10 minutes.

&quot;NO! I will not! I refuse! I must find Akane! I must win her hand before it
is married to your dishonorable name.&quot; Announced Ryoga with a proud voice
while he &#39;marched&#39; beside Ranma.

&quot;You dumbass. Even if I were out of the picture, I&#39;m not the only person you
gotta deal with. She&#39;s got two girlfriends.&quot; Smirked Ranma with a superior
smile, knowing all too well that those girls were also his &#39;girlfriends&#39;.

&quot;Yea, I know.&quot; Scoffed Ryoga, unconcerned. &quot;No doubt her beauty has snared
a couple of confused girls who then fell in love with her, and since Akane
is so sweet herself, she could not say no to their advances. But she will be
mine. I will show those girls that it is destiny that Akane should be with 
me.
Then they will have to leave, that and, my increadible strenght will 
frighten
them away. Ha ha ha!&quot;

Ranma&#39;s eyebrow lifts in dibelief. &quot;You haven&#39;t a clue who the girls are?
Do you? The first one is Ukyo.&quot;

&quot;Ukyo huh? No problem. I can handle that spatual of hers!!&quot; Scoffed Ryoga
yet again.

&quot;(You never could before, P-Chan.) Well then, if that hasn&#39;t got you,
then this will, the other girl is Shampoo!&quot;

&quot;Shampoo? The Chinese girl who speaks really bad Japanese? I always thought
she was a fruit-loop, now I know for sure. She&#39;s too crazy to be a problem
for me. Those Bon-Bori of hers are not a problem.&quot;

&quot;You really are a dumbass P-Chan.&quot; Lectured Ranma. &quot;Shampoo is the most
dangerous of the two. If she catches you trying to take Akane away, she&#39;ll
do things to you.&quot;

&quot;Things? What kind of things?&quot; Asked Ryoga, now a little concerned.

&quot;Amazon Things....&quot; Continued Ranma before stopping in his tracks.

They had now reached the street of Okonmiyaki Ucchans, and could now
see the state of it. The front entrance had been smashed open, it looked
like the place had been attacked from outside and within.

&quot;No way....the girls. The GIRLS!!!&quot; Ranma began to sprint up to the 
resturant
with Ryoga in close persuit. Inside was a scene of desimation. The furnature
had been thrown everywhere. The tables were now in a huge pile in the 
corner,
and the walls were damaged. Signs of a fight were everywhere. Nabiki&#39;s
now cold coffee sat at one of the booths with her paperwork beside it, and
shine from the lights upstairs broke through via the darkened kitchen.

&quot;Oh man! AKANE!!.....UKYO!!.......SHAMPOO!! Anyone!!&quot;
It was erringly silent in the room, until they could hear a muffled voice
from behind the counter.

They move over to the counter, only to find find Nabiki sitting behind it,
bound and gagged with tears in her eyes.

The Tendo girl instantly noticed Ranma and greeted him with eyes that
seemed plead him to release her. &quot;Nadiki? No way...&quot; Uttered Ranma while
knelt down beside Nabs to untie her. The second her hands were loosened
she quickly pulled off her gag and began to loosen the binds on her ankles.

&quot;Nabiki, what happened here? Who wreaked the place? Who tied you?&quot;
Asked Ranma with venom in his voice, he was furious now that this had 
happened.
&quot;Ninjas...&quot; Replied Nabiki, who was still very shaken by her ordeal.
&quot;...masked ninja&#39;s in black. One male....two female-&quot;

&quot;NOOOOOO!!!&quot; Nabiki was suddenly inturupted by a screaming Ryoga who had
somehow succeeded to sneak up to Ukyo&#39;s room and was now rushing back
into the resturant.

&quot;What is it *NOW*?!&quot; Asked an already aggrivated Ranma.

&quot;AKANE! She&#39;s gone!!!!&quot; Came a panicy response.

Nabiki climbed back to her feet with the help of Ranma.
&quot;She was taken with the girls. One of them went up there, and somehow
knocked them all out. I saw the girls being carried away. They were naked...
..and tied up like me.....all this just after they attacked Konatsu and-&quot;

A relevation had just entered her mind. &quot;....Oh KONATSU!!&quot; She rushed past
Ranma and ran over to the pile tables.
&quot;Please be ok Konatsu!!!&quot; Yelled the Tendo girl as she flung the collapsable
furnature away with unusual strength. Ranma and Ryoga were about to help 
her,
but by the time they had reached the tables, Nabiki had found him.

Konatsu was bruised, bloody, and out-cold. He nearly looked dead.
&quot;Oh Konatsu NO! Please no!....&quot; For some reason, this moved the girl, with
tears nearly escaping her eyes. She felt the face of her fallen friend,
and found it to be still warm. He was alive, and this gave her some hope.
&quot;Wake up Konatsu!!! WAKE UP!!! Come on...there must be something I can do.
Oh....if only I hadn&#39;t paid someone to take that compulsory First Aid course
in my place...&quot;

Konatsu&#39;s eyes began ease open now. He now sat up, groaning in pain with a
delighted Nabiki still holding him. &quot;Konatsu! Are you ok?&quot; Came her 
question,
with a sigh of relief.
&quot;Uhhhh...feels like that hangover I got a while back. Except now I&#39;ve got
cuts and bruises.&quot;

Away from this, Ranma looks around, still full of anger.
&quot;We have to find who did this. We have to punish them for wrecking Ukyo&#39;s
resturant and kidnapping the girls. But I get the feeling....that this
isn&#39;t the same as our usual bad guys......it feels very different....&quot;


=======================================================================
[2]====================================================================
=======================================================================
=======================================================================


Darkness. At first....all Akane could feel was the cold night air on her
naked skin, making her shiver. She could feel that there was no wind
in here. Wherever she was, it was indoors, and it was somewhere that hadn&#39;t
been heated in a long time.

Her feeling had started to return with her consciousness. Now she could
feel that she was not on the ground, that instead she was hanging some 
distance
above it. Her arms were stretched far above her head. She looked up, and
then she could see her wrists tied together by the very rope which tethered
her to a roof beam. She now looked down. The Tendo girl cound bearly see
past her own chest. She could however see that she was still fully naked,
her captors hadn&#39;t seemed to bother clothing her.

Naturally, she didn&#39;t want to stay this way, and so she tugged on her
binds. But for some reason she coundn&#39;t even put pressure on the
knot. This seemed disturbingly familiar. She continued to struggle and then
stopped with grunt of frustration, which echoed throughout the room.
It now appeared that she was in a very large place.

&quot;Akane? Is that you awake?&quot; Came the subdued almost whispered voice of Ukyo,
somewhere nearby to her left and behind. &quot;Yes Ukyo. It&#39;s me...&quot; Replied
Akane in a similar voice.

&quot;Oh Sugar, I&#39;m so relieved. Are you ok? Did they hurt you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m ok. Just a little cold. That baka kept me naked, he must be some
kind of pervert, keeping us tied up like this.&quot; Moaned the Tendo Girl.

&quot;I know, I&#39;m nude too and it looks like we&#39;re tied to roof beams......
Akane....I could reach up there with my legs, but he tied my ankles. Could
you check if your legs are free?&quot;

Akane proceeded to struggle, but her legs were also well bound. &quot;Sorry Ukyo,
my ankles are wrapped up too......wh....where&#39;s Shampoo? I can&#39;t hear her!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, she&#39;s here. I can hear her breathing not far from where I am.
I quess she&#39;s in the same state as us.&quot; Ukyo now began to stuggle a little
with her binds, before giving up with a frustrated sigh.
&quot;Damn it! I&#39;ve been trying to break this wierd knot for what must be 20
minutes!. Why can&#39;t I put pressure on it?! It doesn&#39;t make sense, the thing 
is
holding me up, but even my own bodyweight isn&#39;t making it tense. It&#39;s like
the rope isn&#39;t even there!!&quot;

&quot;How long do you think we&#39;ve been up here Ukyo?&quot; Asked Akane, who was now a
little disillusioned by the prospect of yet another kidnap.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure....if we&#39;re not too far from Nerima, I guess whatever amount 
of
time it took to string us up here. Maybe, 1 or 2 hours.&quot;

&quot;Ukyo....I know this knot we&#39;re tied with....It&#39;s the one Shampoo used on
me.....it&#39;s the Amazon Love Knot.&quot;

A grim complexion now filled the chef&#39;s face. &quot;That &#39;Dreaded, Unescapable,
Love Knot&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Uh huh....It&#39;s just like-&quot;

&quot;AIYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;
Shampoo had just woken up, screaming.

&quot;Shampoo! You&#39;re awake!&quot; Exclaimed an overjoyed Ukyo.

&quot;NNNNNNNNNNnnnnnn! Shampoo bound?! NO!!!&quot; The Amazon was more than a
little upset to find herself in this situation.

&quot;Shampoo...&quot; Uttered Akane in calming voice. &quot;...are you ok?&quot;

&quot;Akane-chan?....&quot; The voice of the Tendo girl had managed to calm Shampoo&#39;s
fire for now. &quot;....yes. Shampoo not hurt. But....Spatula Girl and
Akane-Cuddle-Slave....hang from roof too?&quot;

&quot;Yea Shampoo, we&#39;re stuck here too. You can&#39;t see us, but we&#39;re not far 
behind
you. We&#39;re tied hand and foot, just like you probably are, and we&#39;re stuck 
in our
birthday suits, not that you would mind too much about that.&quot; Replied Ukyo.

&quot;Shampoo mind. Shampoo suit-of-birthday only for airens and people Shampoo 
like.
.....What is suit-of-birthday?&quot;

The Amazon then begins to struggle with her binds again. &quot;Nnnnn. Shampoo 
legs tied
too? That over-killing! Shampoo can&#39;t-&quot; Shampoo then noticed the knot that 
bound her.
&quot;-no.....no not that!&quot;

&quot;What is it Shampoo&quot; Asked Akane.

&quot;Shampoo tied with Love Knot!?&quot;

&quot;Yes Shampoo...&quot; Continued Ukyo. &quot;...it&#39;s that knot you used on Akane. That 
means
you can untie us. Right?&quot;

&quot;Noooooooooo! That impossible. This Knot unescapable.&quot;

&quot;It can&#39;t be impossible Shampoo. There must be a way.&quot; Said the chef, 
reassuringly.

The Amazon girl breathed a deep sigh of remorse before she contined.
&quot;This Amazon secret. But Shampoo tell you now. This knot is so dreaded, 
because
no one ever escape it. No captive of Amazon ever get away when this used.
Knot only broken by person who tie, like Amazon lover. Knot was made
for Amazon girls to use on Airen. It stand for love that not die, it not 
break,
even with death...&quot;

&quot;Very good, Xian. I am so glad that those values, have remained with our 
people.&quot;
Echoed a disturbingly familiar female voice from across the huge room.

This caught the 3 girl&#39;s attention, especially Akane, who now feared this 
voice,
she had heard it many times before. They could hear footsteps approach from 
the
floor below.  A dark figure could now be seen by Akane and Ukyo.

When she came into view, they were both shocked. It was the woman in their
dreams. The naked priestess in their &#39;Wedding Dream&#39;, the woman in their
shared &#39;Rape Dream&#39;, and the woman who attacked Akane&#39;s &#39;Womb Dream&#39;.

&quot;YOU!&quot; Screamed out the Tendo Girl.

&quot;Awww...you recognise me Akane, I am so happy that I&#39;m not a stranger to
you.&quot; She continued while she walked closer to the girls.

&quot;You&#39;re behind all this, aren&#39;t you?! You got that ninja to attack Ucchans,
all to capture us.&quot; Added Akane.

&quot;*She* arranged all of this? You recked my resturant, invaded my home,
and did this to my lovers. Who the hell do you think you are?!!&quot;
Screamed Ukyo with a voice full of venom.

&quot;Who am I? I am known by just one name. I am....Ryu.&quot;

Shampoo raises an eyebrow of quriosity. &quot;Ryu? Amazon Ryu?&quot;

Ryu now walks over to Shampoo to show herself to the young Amazon.

&quot;Wait.....you not Amazon! Not even Chinese, you clearly Japanese girl!!&quot;

Ryu smirks. &quot;I am the Ryu of the legends Xian. I am the author of the
scrolls you have been studying. I must say that I&#39;m impressed, you have 
brought
joy to the face of your Airens. You have earned the right to use my 
knowledge.&quot;

Fury now boiled in the blood of the Chinese Girl, who now switched back to 
her
native tongue. &quot;YOU ARE NOT RYU!! She&#39;s been dead for centries!! There is no
way you can be her!&quot; The girls listen to them, dumbfounded.

&quot;Ahhh...back to our language Xain. Good....Yes you are right, my original 
body
died long ago. But my spirit lives on. This young body belonged to a foolish 
girl
from these devil islands, and now her ample frame is mine.&quot;

A scowl now forms on Shampoo&#39;s face. &quot;Why are you doing this? You&#39;ve always 
been
known to be a kind Amazon lover, who only used her powers to bring joy to 
those
in love.&quot; Asked Shampoo, clenching her teeth in anger, not believing that a 
fellow
Amazon would betray her like this.

&quot;An explanation?....Fine....&quot; Uttered Ryu while she returned to her central 
position
in the room. &quot;But let us switch back to their Devil-Language for this, shall 
we.&quot;

&quot;Ok Ryu, Shampoo agree!&quot; Spat out the Chinese girl in Japanese, still 
furious.

&quot;My existence has limits...&quot; Purred the undead Amazon, while her star-shaped
earrings glowed with greater intensity. &quot;...I need a certain.....energy, to
remain in the living world. I need the energy created by true love, it feeds
my ghost and makes it stronger...&quot; Ryu looks down, almost putting herself
in a trance by her own speach. &quot;...it is the very essence of love. In the 
ages
that have passed since my re-birth, I have fed many times, on the love of 
girls
like you.....it is powerful. But it is nowhere near as strong as the love
of a Trinity. I knew if I could make you love each other.....I could feed on
you....I would continue for decades without feeding again....&quot;

The girls remained silent, Ryu&#39;s chilling voice had just implied something
terrible.

&quot;...that&#39;s right girls....your love is of my design. I played with your 
dreams
to make you fall in love.&quot;

All three were shocked by this, none more so than Shampoo. The young Amazon
had heard of such things before. Dreams being used to force relictant Airens
to love their Amazon captor by some sort of magic. She had wanted to learn 
the
art to snare Ranma&#39;s heart, but it was mearly rumor and legend.

But now....how could it happen to her.

&quot;NO! It....it not....it...&quot; Spluted Shampoo as best she could while she 
choaked
on her own emotions.

Ryu simply smiled and walked some distance away from the girls.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry girls. Your love will not go to waist....as powerful as I am,
I could not capture you alone. There are others involved here....&quot;

This served as a cue for three figures to appear, all dressed in black ninja
gear, their idenities made secret by veils. Two were clearly girls,
probably about Akane&#39;s age and the other was a teenage boy, slightly older.

Again, from where they were, only the Tendo girl and Ukyo could see clearly.

&quot;Want to guess who the girls are Akane-chan?&quot; Asked Ryu with a gentle 
softness
which seemed to send a chill down the girl&#39;s spine.

&quot;...You&#39;ll be surprised.....girls......show her.....&quot;

And with that, the veils were removed. Yuka and Sayuri stood in plain view
of the Tendo girl and girlfriend chef, shocking both of them, most of all 
Akane.

&quot;YUKA?!! SAYURI?!! You.....you had a part in *this*?!!!!&quot; Spat an 
exasperated
Akane.

Yuka was the first to speak.

&quot;Akane....Ryu told us....Ryu told us of the love that&#39;s locked inside you.
We know that you love us......Sayuri and I, we found love together, and 
we&#39;ve
been so happy. But we feel a missing link. We love you Akane, not just as a
friend, but as something more.....&quot;

Akane wasn&#39;t sure how to feel when Sayuri took over for her lover.

&quot;.....Akane.....I can&#39;t wait until we get together. I&#39;ve longed to make love
to you. No matter what....we won&#39;t let you go...&quot;

Ryu now stepped back in.

&quot;One other member of this circle must be known.....go on....show them who 
you are....&quot;

Reluctantly, the male ninja unfastened his veil and let it fall to the 
ground.

&quot;MOUSSE?!!!!!&quot; Cried out Ukyo in total shock.

Of course, this caught Shampoo&#39;s attention. &quot;WHAT?!! No, not possible! Let
Shampoo see!&quot;

&quot;Go on Mu-zse, show her.&quot; Ordered Ryu with a smug voice of superiority. She
was clearly loving this.

He edged his way over to near where Shampoo hung, with Ryu close behind.
When she saw him, the sudden sense of surprise she had, was replaced by a
boiling torrent of anger.

&quot;MOOOOOOOOOOOOUSSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; Yelled the Amazon girl while throwing
several graphic Amazonian-Chinese curses, in his direction.
&quot;How dare you! You betray Shampoo like this?!!! All to get Shampoo?!!!!
You not Amazon!!! You not deserve....Nnnnnnn!&quot; Shampoo began to struggle 
with
her binds again. &quot;When Shampoo free, she KILL you Mousse!&quot;

Mousse tried his best to shrugg off this from Shampoo, but still...he was a
little ashamed by this.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t free yourself Xian....take a look down....&quot; Purred Ryu.
All three girls looked below their feet as best they could. All they could
see was a large hole built into the floor below them and darkness beyond it.

&quot;We are on the second floor of this old 2-story rifle-factory. If by some
chance you did manage the impossible and free your arms....you would fall.
Below you is a large smelting pot....it&#39;s full of old rusted bayonettes
and sheet metal. So you see.....if you survived the fall, you would be
ripped to pieces by your landing.&quot;

A grim complexion now came over the three lovers. The only thing keeping
them alive was thier captivity, and this depressed them, removing what
little hope was left.

&quot;Please Akane, don&#39;t try to escape.&quot; Pleaded Sayuri.
&quot;Yea Akane, we don&#39;t want to see you hurt.&quot; Added Yuka.

&quot;Yuka...Sayuri....&quot; Whispered Akane, disenchanted by this betrayal by her
friends. &quot;...why....why?&quot;

Ryu heard this.
&quot;You want to know why Akane-chan? Fine...I&#39;ll let you all know the plan for
tonight.-&quot;

Ryu moved off into the darkness, from where she came. The 3 three &#39;ninjas&#39;
followed her, as if they knew what was next.
Suddenly the darkness was broken by a series of flame torches which were lit
by the ninjas.

In plain view of Akane and Ukyo a circular Amazon symbol was visable on the
factory floor. Around it were many torches and in the middle, where Ryu 
stood,
was a tall wooden stake.

While stroking the stake, Ryu continued. &quot;I set up this sacred place with 
our
sign for fertility.....One by one, I will take that love energy from you.
You will lose that love for eachother and give it to me. Then, I will take
what is left and direct it to someone else...&quot;

The girls looked horrified at Ryu&#39;s revelation.

&quot;Akane....your love will be for Yuka and Sayuri. Xian....you will love
Mu sze, as you *should*. And as for Ukyo.....&quot;

Ryu cocked her head slightly and then sighed as she looked at the chef with
a smile. &quot;Oh.....kind-hearted Ukyo.....I had tried to get Konatsu to join
me in this....but it seems he couldn&#39;t find it in himself to betray you...&quot;

This brought a tear to the cook&#39;s eye. &quot;Oh Konatsu...&quot; She whispered while
that tear rolled down her cheek.

&quot;It is sweet of him I suppose....&quot; Added Ryu in her typical chilling voice.
&quot;....but it is his loss. Oh well...I guess I could keep your healthy body
as a back up host, should this one ever fail me.&quot;

With that final twist of the knife in their hearts, Ryu walked to
the girls, yet again.

&quot;Now girls.....who should go first?&quot; She scanned her eyes across all
three girls. From where she was, she could see the back of Shampoo,
the full front of Akane and the side of Ukyo.
But it was clear who she had in her sights, when she made eye-contact
with the Tendo-girl.

&quot;...yes....&quot; She purred while smiling at the terrified Japanese girl.
&quot;....who should go first?&quot;

=====================================================================

A map of Nerima is planted firm on a table in Okonomiyaki Ucchans,
surrounded by Ranma, Ryoga, Konatsu and Nabiki.

&quot;Where the hell could they have gone?&quot; Snapped Ranma, pounding the
map as he spoke.

&quot;Wherever they went, it was on foot. There are no tyre-marks anywhere
near here.&quot; Added Konatsu.

&quot;If they went on foot, they must have taken a hidden route-&quot;
Came Nabiki&#39;s 2 cents. &quot;-the girls were bound and naked, slung over
each of the ninja&#39;s backs. Someone would have seen them and called
the police if they took a normal walkway.&quot;

&quot;Is this a map of Nerima?! I never knew the streets were *this* way.&quot;
Exclaimed Ryoga, amazed by this plan of the suburb.
&quot;-Hey! Is that my house?&quot; Added the cursed boy, pointing.

&quot;No Pigsy, that&#39;s *here*!&quot; Snapped Ranma again, now at his wit&#39;s end with
&#39;Pigsy&#39;.

&quot;Since they&#39;re on foot....&quot; Continued Konatsu. &quot;-they can&#39;t get far.
Look here-&quot; He points at what appears to be a river on the map. &quot;-this is
Nerima&#39;s main storm channel, not far from here. It&#39;s dry right now,
they could go down there without being seen.&quot;

Konatsu studies the map further for a second. &quot;The channel empties out
into the river. But before that, it goes north-west and leaves Nerima
for the nearby country-side.&quot;

&quot;Those fields out north?&quot; Quizzed Nabiki. &quot;-but they&#39;re just dead farms.
The soil there is all polluted from Tokyo waste. The farm houses were all
demolised. There is nowhere they could bring them.&quot;

&quot;Not true....&quot; Countered Ranma. &quot;Isn&#39;t the old War-time Rifle Factory out
there?&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot; Thought Konatsu, out-loud. &quot;It was shut down when the Americans
invaded, but no one bothered to knock it down. It has heavy, 
explosive-resistant
walls and would be good place to hold someone captive without anyone 
hearing.&quot;

&quot;Those cowards...&quot; Replied Ranma. &quot;...what do they want *this* time?! Who 
the
hell took them now? Akane, Ukyo and Shampoo each have wierdos, who are after 
them
and would do something like this, wierdos like Pigsy here.&quot; Ranma didn&#39;t 
seem to
care that Ryoga was standing right behind them.

&quot;But this is different...&quot; Countered Konatsu. &quot;...this isn&#39;t the typical
ham-fisted kidnapping that usually happens to them. This was well 
organised...
whoever did it, knew exactly when to hit and somehow had enough skill to
knock out and tie up all three of those girls.&quot;
Konatsu now remembers that Ryu appeared to him just before the attack.
A feeling of dread filled him, he knew that Ukyo was in grave danger.

Ranma thought about this for a second. &quot;If someone was lucky or sly enough,
they could get one of them, but all three at once? Something really
powerful must be doing this.&quot;

&quot;Something....or....someone?&quot; Added Konatsu with a voice of stern refletion.

This peaked Nabiki&#39;s interest. &quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; She asked.

&quot;I don&#39;t know...but someone....this woman, she was like a shadow, but she
had a presence, kind of like Shampoo but much stronger. She appeared in my
room, not long before the attack....she asked me to join her, to win Ukyo&#39;s
love. I refused to help her.....she said I would regret it....soon.&quot;
Muttered the ninja while the others listened.

&quot;Like Shampoo?&quot; Mused Ranma. &quot;Sounds like some kind of Amazon scheme. Maybe
Shampoo&#39;s relitives are trying to do something to her and the girls?
Those sex-mad jungle-girls have done worse in the past.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s settled then....&quot; Announced Konatsu, preparing himself to leave.
&quot;...we go to the Rifle Factory.&quot;

&quot;Wow, wow, wow!&quot; Counters Ranma. &quot;What is this &#39;WE&#39; about?! *I&#39;M* going 
there
to rescue them alone. You&#39;ll just get in the way of my inceadible moves!&quot;

&quot;No chance. As long as Ukyo is a hostage *I&#39;m* coming to save her!&quot; Konatsu
wasn&#39;t going to let this slide, and his determination was clear to see.

&quot;Alright fine then. Your skills might make a good decoy or something.&quot;
Grubled the cursed groom-to-be.

&quot;Then.....*I&#39;m* coming too!!&quot; Announced Nabiki, much to the surprise to 
everyone
there.

They all looked at her with a &#39;What the hell is this?&#39; look.

&quot;I *mean* it! I want to come!&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Asked Ranma with a dry condesending voice.

&quot;Because I....emm...I...&quot; She tried her best not to look at Konatsu, the 
real
reason she wanted to tag along. &quot;...because I want to get revenge on those
bitches who tied me up!!&quot; She came up with a good excuse which happened to
be believable.

&quot;*No Chance*&quot; Ranma wasn&#39;t having this, this helpless girl would just end up
another hostage in his sexist logic. &quot;You&#39;ll probably end up like the
other girls and your dad will kill me if something happens to you!&quot;

&quot;*Something* already HAS happened to me! And if I go home now, I&#39;ll just 
tell
him what&#39;s happened to me and Akane, and he&#39;ll go nuts! So you HAVE to take
me along.&quot; She had a point and Ranma had a hard time fighting it.

&quot;Damn it! Fine! Let&#39;s go now while we&#39;ve still got the darkness of the 
night.&quot;

The trio get together and make their way out of the ruins of Ukyo&#39;s 
Resturant,
only to be followed by Ryoga. Ranma noticed this and stopped him in his 
tracks.

&quot;Where are *you* going Fun-Size-Bacon-boy?&quot; Snapped Ranma, now exhaused with
this guy&#39;s presence.

&quot;With you guys....I....don&#39;t know how to get to the factory.&quot; Ryoga&#39;s
announcment pushed Ranma&#39;s patience over the edge, forcing him to punch
a nearby lamp-post to relieve that tension.

==========================================================================
&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;
&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;
[4]&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;
&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;
==========================================================================

And so the rescue party make their &#39;merry&#39; way from Ucchan&#39;s, with Ranma
&#39;merrily&#39; singing Ryoga&#39;s curses and the rest of them &#39;merrily&#39; ignoring
him. They had entered the storm channel and found it to be completely dry.

Keeping a brisk pace, they began to follow the course of the man-made
river. Ranma and Ryoga continued to fight with each other over Akane, again,
but some steps behind them, Nabiki and Konatsu walked together.

The Tendo Girl let out a light sigh while she felt her wrists, they seemed
to be bothering her. Konatsu sees this.

&quot;You ok? Is something wrong with your arms?&quot; He asked.

Surprised that Konatsu had noticed that, Nabiki replied with another sigh
before speaking. &quot;Ohh....it&#39;s just my wrists. Those bitches tied them
pretty tight. It hurt. It still is hurting.&quot;

&quot;You seem a little...I dunno...upset about it.&quot;

Nabiki looks down, she&#39;s now seemed to be ashamed to show her true feelings.
&quot;Well....it&#39;s just, I never had that happen to me before. I felt so trapped,
with the girls gone, you buried, and me just helpless behind the counter.
I couldn&#39;t even call out for help.&quot;

Konatsu had been woken after Nabiki was released so hadn&#39;t a clue what had
happened to her. &quot;They bound and gagged you?!&quot; He asked, a little horrified
by the idea.

Nabiki nodded slightly, with a small tear now trickling down her cheek.
&quot;That was scary. I guess....now I understand how Akane feels when
Weirdo-of-the-Month comes and kidnaps her. It must be worse for her.&quot;
Nabiki now notices the tear on her cheek.

&quot;Oh look at me. How ridiculous, I&#39;m crying. Crying over something so 
stupid.&quot;
She uttered while wiping her cheek clean.

&quot;No, it&#39;s not stupid. You&#39;re a thinking girl, you&#39;re not usually involved 
with
the crazy stuff your sister does (unless it&#39;s of you own doing). You&#39;re just
not used to it, that&#39;s all. Just feel lucky they left you in Ucchan&#39;s and
didn&#39;t take you with them. That would have been bad.&quot;

Konatsu&#39;s words seemed to calm the girl&#39;s nerves, and she now smiled when 
she
looked at him. &quot;Thank you Konatsu...&quot; She said in a warm voice before 
getting
much closer and taking the ninja by surprise when she linked her arm around 
his.
&quot;...you were very brave when you fought all three ninja&#39;s, and when you 
tried to
defend me.&quot;

Konatsu tried to keep his cool in the light of Nabiki&#39;s obvious advances.
&quot;Hey...it was, it was....nothing. Besides, I failed. You got tied up, the
girls got kidnapped, and I got buried under Ukyo&#39;s &#39;just-in-case&#39; 
collapsible
tables.&quot;

Ignoring his words Nabiki now rests her head on Konatsu&#39;s shoulder sending 
the
guy&#39;s head spinning. &quot;Still-&quot; She said. &quot;-you were good and I think you-&quot;

&quot;HEY!&quot; She was interrupted mid-sentence by Ranma, yelling from ahead.

&quot;-Romeo! Juliet! Cut that out and pick up the pace. We gotta go save my
women!&quot;

The pair immeadialty jump away from each other in total embarrassment.
Then Nabiki notices that something is missing.
&quot;Hey...where&#39;s Ryoga?&quot;

Ranma looks to his left and sees that the cursed boy was gone.
&quot;Ahh....good. That dumbass Pigsy got lost again. Come on! We got
to move faster! They might do something to the girls when we get daylight
back.&quot;

Surprisingly...he was right.

==========================================================================
&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;
&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;
[5]&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;
&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;
==========================================================================

&quot;A new day will be born soon...&quot; Chirped Ryu cheerfully while she watched
Akane being bound to the stake by Yuka and Sayuri.
&quot;...from the womb of the Goddess, it will shine a new light onto this
cursed Devil Island and it&#39;s children, and with that new light Akane,
your love will be reborn.&quot;

Akane had never been this frightened before. A single look from Ryu
sent shivers down her spine, it was as if the undead Amazon could
see right into her soul. Despite the obvious, she had never felt that
naked before. This froze her to the spot while her &#39;friends&#39; bound her
&#39;lovingly&#39; to the wooden stake. Sayuri finished a knot binding Akane&#39;s
ankles, and before walking away she smiled at her with genuine warmth.
Sayuri was convinced that soon, herself and Yuka would be with her.
&quot;Be with you soon.....Akane....I mean.....Akane-chan.&quot; She whispered
that gently before skipping off to where Yuka stood.

Akane&#39;s feelings towards her two &#39;girlfriends&#39; where now very mixed.
Right now they were an intorable mix between fear and hatred. How could they
do this to her? And to add to that...what kind of power do they have...to
make her so helpless? And finally, just to make things worse, the whole
bombshell of finding out that they were in *love* with her, still shook
her. Her friends of many years, now wanted to have sex with her.

Ryu now moves closer to Akane, terrifying the girl so much, that she starts
to shiver.

&quot;Akane? Oh Akane, please don&#39;t be afraid of me. You know a won&#39;t hurt you.&quot;
Ryu walks right up to the Tendo girl, causing the girl to droop her head in
fear. She now shivered even more violently.

&quot;How I hate to cause such fear in girls....I&#39;m not really a monster you 
know.&quot;
This softer tone of voice did nothing to calm Akane, leaving Ryu to do 
something
she had wanted to do all night long. Much to Akane&#39;s surprise and absolute 
horror,
Ryu wrapped her arms around the Tendo Girl&#39;s waist and tightened then to 
bring their
bodies together in an embrace.

Ryu&#39;s hug was met with a quickening of Akane&#39;s breath when she realised 
where Ryu
was now. That stopped very quickly, when she froze yet again. Ryu&#39;s touch, 
the
hold of her hands around her waist and hips, and very way she used the 
curves of
her body to pacify the girl, took Akane&#39;s breath away. For all you could say 
about
Ryu, this woman defiantly knew how to hug a girl right.

Yuka and Sayuri could see this in plain sight before them, and they didn&#39;t 
like
it one bit. But they kept their jealousy quiet for now.

&quot;(Shhh.....Akane...)&quot; Whispered the undead Amazon softly into Akane&#39;s ear.
&quot;(I don&#39;t want you to fear me...or hate me.....)&quot;
Each whisper tickled the Tendo girl&#39;s ear playfully.
&quot;(...Akane.....you mean a lot to me.....ever since I first saw you....)&quot;
The whispers now began to contain some new emotions from Ryu.
&quot;(....Remember the mountain forest Akane?)&quot;
Akane&#39;s eye&#39;s widen in surprise.
&quot;(....how I loved to play with you....it has been a while since I &#39;pinched&#39;
someone there........you&#39;re so cute, so goddess-like naked.....)&quot;
Ryu held her even tighter now.
&quot;(....how you remind me.....of *her*.....Akane......I&#39;m not giving you to 
those
girls.....)&quot;

Ryu backs away to face Akane and then strokes her cheek.
&quot;(....I&#39;m keeping you for myself......Akane......I love you.)&quot;
Akane&#39;s surprise merely continued, but her fear reached it&#39;s apex when Ryu 
cocked
her head and moved their heads closer.

With one soft move, Ryu kissed Akane on the cheek, giving her the Kiss of 
Death.

Akane...was now Ryu&#39;s airen.

Yet again, the Tendo Girl was in shock. Only Shampoo had ever kissed her
like that, and because of this, she knew what Ryu had done.

Akane had had enough, and was now so frightened that she was willing
to swallow that fear in one go and make one last heroic stand.

&quot;Please!&quot; She called out in voice of tears. &quot;Ryu please!&quot;
She looked directly into the shocked eyes of her captor with rivers flowing
from her own. &quot;...Ryu....I don&#39;t care what you did to make me love Ukyo and
Shampoo! I don&#39;t *care* if it&#39;s all a trick!! I LOVE them! That&#39;s all that
matters to me!!&quot;

Of course this touched her lovers, who while hanging from where the were,
quietly reacted to this.

&quot;(Oh....Akane.......sugar)&quot; Came an expected whisper from Ukyo.
Shampoo said nothing, Akane&#39;s act had jerked a tear from her eye, which now 
rolled
down her body, leaving a silver line in it&#39;s wake.

Akane continued: &quot;You can do whatever you like with me Ryu, I can&#39;t stop 
you.
But please....let my girlfriends go! Let them go....and I&#39;ll....give myself 
to you
.........willingly...&quot; That last word reduced her to tears again.

&quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!&quot; Screamed Shampoo at the top of her lungs.
&quot;No take Akane! Take Shampoo!!! Take me and let my airens go!!!&quot;
This passionate cry of near perfect Japanese, stunned the un-dead Amazon 
even
more, before she spoke again to Akane.

&quot;Akane....&quot; She spoke softly while brushing Akane&#39;s cheek with the back of 
her
hand. &quot;...how noble and brave you are....what love you command from those 
you care
about.....I want you even more now.&quot;

Little did Ryu know, that Sayuri heard all of this and was now less than 
pleased
at what was happening.
&quot;Ryu?&quot; She butted in, obviously peeved. &quot;What is going on here?! It sounds 
like you
want to keep our Akane for YOURSELF!&quot;

Ryu turned to the girl, she wore a neutral face which hid a torrent of quiet 
anger
at the insolent little &#39;Devil-Girl&#39; who dared to ask her this.
&quot;What if I am....Sayuri?&quot; Replied Ryu, with a threat.
&quot;What are you two going to do about it? *I* gave you those powers you now 
wield.
And *I* can take them away.&quot;

Ryu advances toward Sayuri, forcing her to retreat to the hold of Yuka.
&quot;Disobey me....Sayuri.....and the both of you will be stripped and bound to 
my
stake, just like Akane. But unlike her, I will drain you of everything, like
my past victims. Never to feel love again.&quot; The lovers held each other 
frightened.
Now that Ryu had betrayed them, they knew that her threat was very real,
even if they obeyed her.

&quot;The sun has broken the horizon!!&quot; Called Mousse from a east-facing window 
on the
other side of the factory, interrupting what Ryu was doing.
The Amazon&#39;s face now lit up, her wait was over.

&quot;The joyous moment has arrived&quot; She said, still looking at Sayuri with a 
stern
face, before walking towards Akane.
&quot;Now, Akane, my airen. I must begin the prayer.&quot;
She stopped just short of the now exhausted Japanese girl.
&quot;I will use the Lure Chant to drain your love and then the Chant of Making 
to
mould what is left into your love for me. You will feel empty afterward....
that is normal, but with my loving care, you will regain the love you lost,
and it will all be for me.&quot;

Ryu centred herself, placing her arms rigid to her torso, and then closing 
her
eyes while she put herself into a trance, before she began to say some kind
of prayer.

&quot;Nin xiano diat konna isasa, Kon&quot;. Ryu moves her hands up and then places a 
palm
on each of Akane&#39;s breasts.

&quot;Wo xiano diat konna isasa, Kin.&quot; She then cups her hands around Akane&#39;s 
breasts
before sliding them around the girl&#39;s rib-cage.

&quot;Ina Kana, Kon/Kin, Akane.&quot; She now slides her hands slowly down Akane&#39;s 
hips and
with each centimeter travelled, she would repeat that line of the chant.
&quot;Ina Kana, Kon/Kin, Akane.&quot;
&quot;Ina Kana, Kon/Kin, Akane.&quot;
&quot;Ina Kana, Kon/Kin, Akane.&quot;
&quot;Ina Kana, Kon/Kin, A...ka...ne.&quot;
&quot;Ina.....K Ka..na, Kon......Kin, A...k k kan.....NE!!.&quot;
Akane could now feel something terrible inside of her very soul. Ryu&#39;s 
difficulty
with the chant seemed to signify the increasing power of the spell she was 
casting.

Akane&#39;s skin now began to sweat heavily, Ryu&#39;s hands were very much south
of the &#39;Equator&#39; on the girl&#39;s outer thigh. The Amazon now slid her hands 
around
Akane&#39;s leg and rested them on her inner thigh, them she began to move...up.
Ryu&#39;s &#39;destination&#39; was now all to obvious to all who could see, and 
especially
to Akane, who now felt an uneasy sense of arousal with Ryu&#39;s touch.

But this panicked Akane, she knew that it was a sign that she was losing to
Ryu, and so she called out.
&quot;NO! DON&#39;T! Please stop! I don&#39;t want to stop loving them! Stop it! STOP 
IT!!&quot;

&quot;AKANE!&quot; Called Ukyo from where she was hanging. &quot;DON&#39;T LET HER BEAT YOU!
We can still get out of this!&quot; Herself and Shampoo now struggled violently 
to
escape from their binds. They didn&#39;t seem to care that escape was 
impossible,
or the fact that breaking their binds would have meant their death. All
they cared about, was saving Akane from this mad-woman.

Ryu just smiled at this, and whispered again. &quot;(It&#39;s nearly over Akane.
Soon the pain will be all gone. Then you will be the love of my life.
I will worship you like a Goddess. We will live naked in the land
of my people, and you will know more joy than you can imagine when we mate.
Just like *she* did. And when you die....we will spend eternity together,
as ghosts in love. Just...give in...and joy will be yours.&quot;

Akane was now tempted. That temptation tore her apart. Her loyalty was
strong, but so was Ryu&#39;s magic, and what she had to offer.
She whimpered, and held on. That was all she could do, for now Ryu&#39;s
hands touched her womanhood and threatened to enter, bringing her
spell to it&#39;s greatest intensity.

Ryu&#39;s capture of Akane&#39;s heart looked certain.

But then....

&quot;YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!&quot;

Ranma smashes through one of the windows and lands not far from where Akane
and Ryu were.

Shampoo and Ukyo call out with joy. &quot;RANMA!!!&quot;

&quot;YES! I was right! You guys *are* here....and.....I...emm....&quot;
Ranma now sees a very beautiful young-woman handling a tied-up and naked
Akane in very intimate way. He also sees both Shampoo and Ukyo in
similar situations.

&quot;Wow! No..way!&quot; He says with a slight blush.

&quot;Ranma! Help!!!&quot; Came a teary cry from the Tendo Girl.
Akane&#39;s cry and the tears in her eyes now told Ranma how terrified the girl
was.

&quot;You....bitch......you sexy, well-toned bitch! You&#39;ve been terrorising my 
girls!!&quot;
Ryu stops what she is doing and turns to face Ranma. She doesn&#39;t seem too
concerned with Ranma being here.

&quot;I don&#39;t usually beat up girls....but you&#39;ve frightened Akane and the 
others.
And...for all I know you raped them too. They&#39;re all naked...and stuff.&quot;

Ryu stood firm and took a stance which showed that she was up for a fight.
The smile on her face alone said that.

&quot;Alright!&quot; Spat Ranma when he saw this and then took an attack stance.
&quot;And don&#39;t worry....since you&#39;re a girl....I&#39;ll go a little easy on you!&quot;

&quot;Ranma! No!&quot; Called out Ukyo. &quot;She&#39;s not as weak as you think!!&quot;

It was too late. &quot;YEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!&quot;
Ranma leaps in the air as part of a jump-kick towards Ryu.

He was about to reach her when she suddenly put her arm out.
An incredible force took hold of Ranma, freezing him in mid-air.

&quot;Hey! What the?!&quot;

&quot;Ranma Saotome....&quot; Uttered Ryu with a smile. &quot;....I had expected so
much more from you. How pathetic.
How could *you* win the heart of my Akane?&quot;

Ranma struggles against this force desperately while the girls look
on frightened.
&quot;Hey! No fair! Stop holding me here with your voodoo magic!!&quot;

&quot;All of your martial arts skills are nothing compared to
an Amazon Ghost Weapon. Even as a lover, you can&#39;t compare to me.
That is why you will die by my hands tonight.&quot;

This shocked everyone there, most of all Akane, not believing that even
Ryu would murder Ranma. The undead Amazon now advanced to the cursed boy,
who had now been placed on the ground, but still held in place.

&quot;One touch on your chest, and I can make your heart explode! And then
Akane will forever be mine. I knew you would come here tonight Ranma
Saotome, it is your destiny to die, as it was their destiny to be
captured and brought here.&quot; Ranma struggles with her magical hold,
but it was no use, Ryu&#39;s arm drifted closer, and with it, his death.
&quot;Surrender Ranma. Let me give you to the Goddess.&quot;

&quot;NO! Don&#39;t kill him!!!&quot; Screamed out Akane with a burst of tears.
&quot;Please don&#39;t!!!&quot; Followed Ukyo in a similar way.
&quot;No Kill Ranma! Shampoo not able to live without!!&quot;

Their pleas were ignored, as now Ryu wore a sinister smile on her face.
She was clearly pleased to be finally rid of the &#39;competition&#39; for Akane.

&quot;This is it Ranma. Peace for you, I know that your heart has been in turmoil
recently. It will all end now. All that is needed..is.....is....&quot;

Ryu stopped and stood there, frozen. Suddenly, she had noticed something in
Ranma&#39;s eye, something that seemed to shock her.

&quot;It can&#39;t be.....&quot; She whispered, a tear trickling down her eye. It was like 
she
had seen a ghost, and this ghost had melted her cold visage into a face of 
warmth
and emotion.

&quot;....Ama?&quot; She continued to whisper, with tiny streams now flowing from her 
eyes.

She moved right up to Ranma, she used her powers to lower Ranma to the 
ground
before stopping again. The girls look on, dumbfounded.
Ryu coxes her head a little, still looking into Ranma&#39;s eyes.

&quot;...You&#39;re in there....aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;What the hell are you talking about? Weird Voodoo Woman?&quot; Came a typical 
reply from
a perplexed Ranma.

&quot;Mu Zse! Quickly! Bring me cold water! As much as you can!&quot; Came Ryu&#39;s 
order, she had
difficulty in speaking now, her voice was being choked by tears.

Mouse shortly came over with a large beaker of water, and hands it to Ryu.
Then, with a massive smile on her face, Ryu pours it&#39;s freezing contents all 
over
Ranma drenching him.

Needless to say, Ranma wasn&#39;t pleased. The inevitable sex-change happened, 
and Ranma
became a red-headed girl.

Ryu drops the beaker in surprise, smashing it on the ground.
She whimpers and shakes slightly at this sight before bursting into tears.
&quot;AMA!!!!&quot; She screamed out before embracing a helpless Ranma-chan.

&quot;Ama, wo....fwe.r...fes.ffv....ssawsd.&quot; Ryu merely whimpered what sounded 
like
teary gibberish into her embrace.

She holds on crying for some time, and then manages somehow to calm down a 
little.
She loosens the embrace slightly, so she could face &#39;Ama&#39;.

&quot;Ama....I&#39;ve been so lonely without you....I&#39;ve had no dreams since you left 
my side.
Ama....I......&quot; Ryu emotions were firmly in control now. Her sentence was 
ended, now
she pulled Ranma-chan in for a kiss. Ranma really didn&#39;t mind this beautiful 
woman
taking advantage of her, even if she was an evil sorceress who probably just 
raped
Akane, but the fact that the girls were here, made her uneasy. This looked 
like
she was cheating on them.

But that kiss didn&#39;t last very long. Ryu&#39;s velvet lips slipped from 
Ranma-chan&#39;s.
It seemed to be all too much for the undead Amazon. The star-shaped earrings 
which had
shone bright from her lobes, now popped off her ears, and fell from her 
body.
She lost consciousness and fell to the ground, with them.

The great force which had held Ranma-chan in place now released her, and she 
too
nearly fell before centring herself again.

The Girl-Ranma looks down at the slumped body of Ryu, surprised by what she 
was seeing.
The hardened evil that was Ryu, was now a harmless, almost peaceful looking 
girl
slumped on the ground. Ranma looked in surprise at this change in the
young woman, until her concentration was broken by the cries of her 
girlfriends.

&quot;Ranma! Are you ok?!&quot; Cried the still bound Akane.

&quot;Yea....I&#39;m...ok I guess. That was all weird. She thought I was someone 
else.
I...guess....my girl-kiss is *so* amazing, she passed out from the power of 
it!
No wonder I have 3 lesbian girlfriends!&quot; Finished Ranma-chan with a smile 
after
her ego-trip.

&quot;RANMA SAOTOME!!!!!&quot; Mousse came from out of nowhere and landed between her 
and
Shampoo. &quot;You may have stopped Ryu, but I WILL NOT let you take MY 
SHAMPOO!!!&quot;

Ranma looked at the Amazon with a stern expression. She never had any 
patience for him
before, but now, he had gone too far.

&quot;You messed up little Peking Duck. What makes you think you&#39;ve got a chance 
against
me? All you&#39;re good with is a side of barbecue sauce!!&quot; Taunted the cocky 
Ranma-girl.

&quot;Maybe that was true before Saotome, but no longer! Ryu has given me the 
most powerful
weapon of our people, the Ghost Weapon!&quot;
Mousse takes a stance with his arms stretched forward.
He was about to use the Ghost Weapon, and when it looked he would 
attack.....nothing
happened. He struggled with his own body, flexing his arms in vain to create 
the
force he had used to fell Konatsu, but it was useless.

Ranma merely looks at him with a bemused expression, until they were 
interrupted by
Konatsu&#39;s arrival, flying though the window Ranma had already smashed with 
his
entrance.

&quot;Konatsu!&quot; Squealed an overjoyed Ukyo who got a smiling glance in return 
from
Konatsu, who quickly looked away when he noticed that the girls were all 
nude.

&quot;What? Why can&#39;t I do it ANYMORE?!&quot; Yelled Mousse in total disbelieve and 
shock while
looking down at his now powerless hands.

&quot;His power is gone.&quot; Announced Konatsu, flanking the Amazon. &quot;Whatever 
powers he had
must have come from &#39;that woman&#39;.&quot;

Ranma-chan looks down again at the slumped body of Ryu, and then back up 
again at
Mousse, with an evil grin on her face.

&quot;YEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAA!!!&quot; She aims a flying kick at Mousse, throwing him 
across the room,
hitting the wall and knocking him out cold.

Yuka and Sayuri panic, they realise that they were next, and so they dash 
hand-in-hand
to the fire exit, only for that entrance to be blocked off by the shadow of 
an
older girl. The girls stop in their tracks at the sight of this.

&quot;So....I should have guessed it would be you two. You&#39;re going NOWHERE!&quot;
The shadow revealed itself to be a furious Nabiki, who flexed a rope between 
her hands.
The girls embraced each other in fear. It was obvious that Nabiki was keen
on &#39;paying them back&#39; for what they had done to her.

========================================================
[7]-----------------------------------------------------
========================================================

The girls were cut free from their restraints, and were given some old 
sheets to
drape over themselves.

An expected round of tearful embracing started between the girls, who of 
coarse
sucked their hero, Ranma, into it too.

While all this was happening, the unconscious Mousse and Ryu were bound hand 
and
foot. Nabiki was taking personal charge in binding the sobbing couple of 
Yuka and
Sayuri, who now sat helpless, back-to-back. When done, Nabs stood up and 
looked
over toward all of the hugging and scenes of love.

&quot;Typical...&quot; She spat. &quot;All of this is happening, and I forget to bring my
camera!!&quot;

She then notices Ukyo pull away from the embrace, the chef had just spotted
Konatsu, who was trying his best not to look at her naked form.

&quot;Konatsu!!&quot; She cried out with joy before running toward the young ninja, 
leaving
a trickle of tears, and her covering sheet in her wake.

She scooped Konatsu into her arms, and embraced him hard.
&quot;OH! Konatsu! I don&#39;t deserve you! You&#39;re so loyal to me!! You&#39;re the best 
friend a
girl could ever hope for!!!&quot; She finished by furiously planting kisses all 
over his
face. Nabiki saw this with a face of discomfort, she didn&#39;t like this one 
bit.

While all of this was happening, some movements stirred in the background.
Ryu was regaining consciousness, and slowly tried her best to sit up with 
her arms
bound behind her. The difficulty of this forced her to grunt when she 
finished.
The others hear her and quickly move to surround the undead Amazon.

Ryu groans, as if she had a migraine before blinking a few times. Something 
had
happened to her, something which now filled face with joy, she now looked 
like
a totally different person.

&quot;She&#39;s gone....&quot; She whispered with a very different voice. &quot;...finally, I&#39;m 
free...
....I&#39;m Free!&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t look that way from where we&#39;re standing Ryu!&quot; Spat Ukyo with a 
voice
of venom.

The young woman looks up at the chef with smiling face that looked so 
different than
before.

&quot;I&#39;m not Ryu, Ukyo.&quot; She continued with a soft, kind voice. &quot;She just 
enslaved my
body and mind.......my name is Kiki.......Kiki Yamada.&quot;

A state of muted shock filled the room. What Ryu has said was right, she had 
indeed
possessed the body of a Japanese girl. But it was still hard for them to 
believe.

&quot;You&#39;re.....not.......Ryu?&quot; Mused Ukyo out-load, still trying to figure this 
one out.

&quot;No Ukyo....I&#39;m not....you can see I am not.....*her*.&quot; Uttered Kiki 
followed by
a deep breath which seemed to induce a few more tears. &quot;Oh...to actually 
breath
again....to feel the touch of clothes on my skin......moving my own 
arms....&quot;

&quot;Are.....are you Ok?&quot; Asked Akane, now kneeling down to where Kiki sat.

&quot;Yes....it&#39;s just....I thought I&#39;d never be free again. I thought...that Ryu
would use my body until I died......like she did with her previous victims.&quot;

Kiki&#39;s joy was clear for all of them to see, she had just woken from what 
looked
like an endless nightmare. As she began to calm herself a little, she tried 
to
get into a more comfortable sitting position, but she had some difficulty 
thanks
to her binds. Ukyo immediately jumped into action to untie her.

&quot;Oh...I&#39;m so sorry Kiki! We thought you were still Ryu, so I tied you up.
Please forgive us.&quot; Said the chef while she frantically removed the binds 
around
the girl&#39;s limbs.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. This is the least I deserve, after what I let
happen. Ryu wrecked so many lives with my body, and she&#39;s done so many
horrible things to you girls. If I wasn&#39;t so *stupid* none of this would 
have
happened.&quot;

Kiki was set free allowing her to stretch before folding her legs into a
sitting position opposite Akane.

&quot;You&#39;re not from around Tokyo, are you Kiki?&quot; Asked Akane politely, noticing
Kiki&#39;s South Japanese accent.

&quot;You&#39;re right Akane. I&#39;m from Shimonoseki, I was to come here to Nerima to
complete my Shinto training. I am your new Temple Priestess.&quot;

This peeked the interest of all around who now began to sit around her.

&quot;You?&quot; Asked Ukyo. &quot;But you&#39;re way too young. You can&#39;t be older than 25.&quot;

Kiki continued.
&quot;It&#39;s....a....very long story. Needless to say, Ryu took me before I even
left my home town.&quot;

&quot;But....how is Ryu taking Kiki-girl? Ryu dead, die over 3000 years in past.&quot;
Mused Shampoo, wondering how a figure from her past could still be &#39;alive&#39;.

&quot;Those earings....&quot; She replied pointing to the star-shaped pearls which now
lay dead on the ground. &quot;....they hold her ghost. I was given them once....
...by someone....and when I put them on.....*she* was there, and my 
nightmare
began.&quot;

They all look down at what was now left of the legendary Amazon.

&quot;But Shampoo always learn that Ryu was good Amazon. Shampoo learn that she
was always kind, cured people as doctor, making happy by teaching how to
better mate. Amazon learn that Ryu life dedicate to her airen, Ama.
Why......why Ryu turn evil?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right.....&quot; Sighed Kiki before gently taking the ear-rings into her
hand. &quot;....when she took me, she shared all her memories and feelings with
me. I remember....before she died, that she was very kind. Her entire life
was dedicated to a beautiful girl named Ama. Back then she knew nothing but
happiness....&quot;

&quot;What changed her and made her so twisted?&quot; Asked Akane.

&quot;Ama....&quot; Replied Kiki. &quot;Ama died tragically at a very young age.
Her loss ripped Ryu to pieces.....she couldn&#39;t cope.
So....filled with grief, she took her own life, hoping to be with Ama
again.&quot;

The others were moved slightly by this, although their hatred for Ryu
was fresh in their minds...this story seemed to explain things.

&quot;Ryu perform &#39;Wakinitaru&#39;? Shampoo sort of remember that. It....ritual
suicide.....if half of Amazon Love-Slave pact die, other must die too.&quot;
Uttered the Amazon girl looking over at Akane, who returned the stare.

Kiki continued:
&quot;But Ryu couldn&#39;t just kill herself. She knew that the Amazon still needed
her. She was their doctor and served as an example of a lover who looked 
beyond
the need to link love with child-birth. So, using her intimate knowledge of
the human ghost, she attempted to put all of the wealth of her knowledge 
into a
pair of pure &#39;Purple Jade&#39; ear-rings. They were known as the Stars of 
Twilight.

It was Ryu&#39;s intention that the wearer of these ear-rings would instantly 
know
all that she did......giving the Amazon the benefit of her life&#39;s work for
as long as the Jade core survived.

But something terrible went wrong during her suicide ritual. Only her 
knowledge
was supposed to go into those ear-rings that night....instead, her whole 
ghost
was absorbed into them, trapping her there.

Ryu has been trapped inside for over 3000 years now. She had expected to 
die, and
reunite with Ama, but instead....the immortal years without her airen, 
twisted her
into the monster you saw tonight.

As you saw with me, she can take human form if someone is unlucky enough to 
put on
the Stars of Twilight. I am but one of many that she has captured over the 
years.
She comes into your mind.....like a dream.....just you and her.....she takes 
you into
a dream of her making and then binds you there. That is where you stay while 
you watch
and feel her using your body....to do those terrible things.&quot;

&quot;She....*can* make dreams?&quot; Asked Ukyo seeing the link now between Ryu and 
her
&#39;wedding&#39;.

&quot;Yes Uyko, dreams are the very essence of our ghosts, Ryu knew this and much 
more.
The dreams she can make are as good as reality....because in a way, they 
are.
I remember the wedding dream, with you 3 girls. She even used an image of my 
body
in it.

But the ability to use me for all this came at a price. Like a vampire, she 
needs
to feed off the energy of living people, and the best kind for her purposes 
is
the energy created from those in love. She would catch them, hold them 
prisoner and
do what she tried to do to you girls. Most of the time....all that was left 
were
loveless shells of people. She took a few victims while she had me.....I 
remember
their terrified faces......all of them.....but what is worse, I can remember
*all* of them, hundreds of them.....mostly girls....her original love for 
Ama
twisted into something disgusting...which.....&quot;

Kiki looks up at the Tendo-girl apologietically, and also with a face of 
shame.
&quot;Akane.....I&#39;m *so* sorry. I knew what she was planning, and I tried so hard 
to
stop her.....but.....she was too strong.....I&#39;m.....I&#39;m sorry!!&quot;
Kiki bows right down to the ground, hopeing for forgivness.

&quot;Th..that&#39;s ok...you&#39;re a victim too Kiki. What she did to me couldn&#39;t 
nearly be
as bad as what she did to you.&quot; Came Akane with a voice of re-assurance.

Kiki sits up again and begins to dry her eyes with her long sleave, the 
tears had
finally stopped.
&quot;Thank you Akane. I can now see why she loves you.&quot;

Akane blushes at this.

&quot;Well....now that you&#39;re free, what are you going to do...?&quot; Asked Ukyo.
&quot;...are you going to go back home to Shimonoseki?&quot;

&quot;Hmm? No....&quot; Mused Kiki. &quot;....I&#39;m kinda where I wanted to be. I always 
wanted
to be a priestess in a nice neigbourhood like this &#39;Nerima&#39; place.&quot;

&quot;Nerima? Nice?! Kiki I think you have th---&quot; Akane is quickly gagged by 
Ukyo&#39;s
hand while the chef inturrupts. &quot;(Don&#39;t scare her off Akane) So...you&#39;re 
going
to stay and be our new priestess?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I think I will. If you will have me of coarse, I would understand if 
you
don&#39;t want me here, after all that with Ryu. I would remind you of bad 
memories.&quot;
Uttered Kiki, now becoming a shy about this.

&quot;No, we don&#39;t care about that. Please stay....oh and.....Kiki?
Can I ask you something?&quot; Asked Ukyo with a meek voice while she played with 
a
corner of her covering sheet.

&quot;Yea, sure.&quot; Chirped Kiki, now happy to know that she was welcome.

&quot;Do you know anything about Shinto weddings with more than....one bride?&quot;

Kiki raised and eyebrow to Ukyo&#39;s question and then smiled a little.
&quot;Ryu knew all about that idea of your&#39;s. Hmm....I guess it&#39;s not against
the rules for 3 girls to marry one guy. The trick is to get someone to
do it for you. Most people in this job are very conservative.
The whole idea of a lesbain would turn their hair grey....if it wasn&#39;t 
already.&quot;

Kiki mused about this for a second.
&quot;I guess *I* could to it for you.&quot;

The eyes of all three girls now widened in excitment.
&quot;Really?!! You&#39;ll marry us?!!&quot; Screamed Akane excitedly.


&quot;Well..yea...and I&#39;ll do it for free, I really want to make up for all 
this.&quot;

Akane and Ukyo were about to jump forward and hug the girl, but managed to
stop themselves knowing that she was their Priestess. Shampoo however had no
such considerations and lundged toward the girl, embracing hard.

&quot;Kiki-girl so kind! Shampoo love Kiki-girl for this!!&quot; Shampoo followed this
with a kiss placed firm on the girl&#39;s mouth.

&quot;SHAMPOO!!!&quot; Both girls rip their lover from the embarresed young woman.

&quot;What? What Shampoo do wrong?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t show *that* sort of disrespect to a temple priestess Shampoo!!&quot;
Scoulded Akane while the amazon was sat down between them.

Kiki merely giggles at all this.
&quot;Don&#39;t worry girls, an innocent little kiss is nothing compared to what
*she* did to me.&quot;
Kiki looks down at the Stars of Twilight and takes them into her hand.
&quot;But maybe....some good can come of all this...&quot;
She looks over toward Shampoo.
&quot;Shampoo.....you want to be free of your curse, don&#39;t you?&quot;

The young amazon sat there dumbfounded, before repling.
&quot;Y...yes, Shampoo want not to be hello kitty cat when touching cold water.
Ranma scared of hello kittys, makes it hard for Shampoo to mate with him.&quot;

&quot;Scared?!&quot; Scoffed Ranma. &quot;I&#39;m not scared of those wall-scaling rats....
...it&#39;s...just....they don&#39;t fight with...emm...honor....yea...&quot;

Ignoring what Ranma just said, Kiki continues.
&quot;Well Shampoo, Ryu knew a lot about those Jusenkyo curses. She never shared
that knowledge with me, but I&#39;ve a feeling that she knew enough to free
you from the curse.&quot;

Shampoo squirms free of her girlfriends and begins to crawl over to Kiki
with eyes of disbelief. &quot;Kiki...Kiki say that Shampoo can get of cured?&quot;

&quot;Yes....but....you&#39;ll have to....put on the Stars of Twilight.&quot;

Shampoo imeadiatly jumps back to the hold of her girlfriends upon hearing
this. &quot;Aiya! That turn Shampoo into RYU!!! Shampoo no want! Shampoo NO 
WANT!!!&quot;
Ukyo looks at Kiki with scornful eyes.
&quot;What kind of help is THAT?!&quot; Asked the chef, wondering if the girl was 
really
free of Ryu. &quot;What if she&#39;s still controlling you? What if she&#39;s trying to 
get
a new host?! She could also use her identity to get her hands on Akane!!&quot;

Kiki was a little taken back, and now feared what the girls might do to her
if they thought she was still Ryu.
&quot;I...I don&#39;t know what to say.....I&#39;ve no way of proving that I&#39;m not *her*.
All I know is that Shampoo would be safe.....Ryu&#39;s energy is drained.
She can only take a willing host now, she really really needed to drain you
girls of energy, she can&#39;t do much now.&quot;

Ukyo stands down a little. &quot;Shampoo, sugar, do you really not want to put on
the ear-rings?&quot;

Shampoo remained silent for a second while she plucked up some courage.
&quot;N...no. Shampoo must face Ryu. Shampoo must learn cure for curse, and face
demons that try to steal Akane away.&quot;

Kiki places the Stars infront of Shampoo.
&quot;It&#39;s up to you, I won&#39;t force you.&quot; Said Kiki, apologetically.

Shampoo swallows deep before taking them in her hand.

&quot;Shampoo wait!&quot; Akane grasped Shampoo&#39;s shoulded hard, she was frightened.
&quot;I don&#39;t want to lose you to her.&quot;

The Amazon looked at her and smiled before placing a soft kiss on her
mouth. &quot;Shampoo need to do this-&quot;

She looks over at Ukyo and does the same. &quot;-or Shampoo never live with 
self.&quot;

And with that she took a star in each hand and raised them to her earlobe.
She didn&#39;t even need to clip them in, they attached themselves to her skin,
like magnets to metal.

For the first few seconds, nothing happens. They all just watch Shampoo.

&quot;Emm....Shampoo not feel anything....is it work---&quot; Shampoo was caught
mid-sentence by a strange feeling within her. The stars now shone bright,
just like when Kiki wore them. The girl looked frozen, just before she
keeled over and fell into Ukyo&#39;s lap, much to the girl&#39;s horror.

&quot;SHAMPOO?!!!!&quot; Both Akane and Ukyo go to her, fearing something terrible.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry girls, she&#39;s ok. The Stars are forcing her to sleep. She
has to sleep if she has any hope of reaching Ryu. She lives in dreams.&quot;
Kiki looks down at the unconcious Amazon.
&quot;We just have to hope she can get though to her....&quot;

=====================================================================
[8]==================================================================

Shampoo wakes. But not where she thought she would be.
All she could see was brilliant white light everywhere. Also the ground
felt soft on her bare feet. Looking down, she could see that she was
naked here too. It was difficult to feel such things here, nothing seemed
real.

Just then, she heard sobbing in the distance. The muffled tears of a
woman could be heard. Naturally, Shampoo moved towards this sound,
trying to see as best she could through this bright haze.

Suddenly, she could focus on something. She could see a nude woman now,
curled up on the ground, crying bitterly.

Shampoo eased her way closer to her, knelt, and placed a hand on her 
shoulder.

&quot;Are...are you ok?&quot; She asked in her own language. It seemed that she could 
only
speak her mother-tongue here.

The crying dies down a little while the young woman turns her head to face 
her
only companion here. Shampoo was taken back by the beauty of her face when 
she
finally returned her gaze. Her eyes seemed endless, and she nearly got lost 
in there
while her cheeks began to redden a little.

The woman seemed to recognise her.

&quot;....Xian?&quot; Came the voice of Ryu. &quot;....why...why are you here?&quot;

Shampoo was a little conflicted right now. She knew that voice belonged to 
that
evil monster who tried to take Akane away, but she was so beautiful...was 
this
the true face of Ryu?

She just remained silent while Ryu dried her eyes and then backed off a bit 
when
the undead Amazon began to get up.

In a single elegant move, Ryu rose to her feet infront of her kneeling 
desendant,
leaving poor Shampoo speachless. The heaving of her chest and flowing of her 
long
bruinette hair was hypnotising. The young Amazon&#39;s face burned amber-red 
now...
...she could see the fully mature and well endowed physique of Ryu, which 
looked
just as it did when she was alive.

Shampoo had heard legends of this beauty, but seeing it in the flesh like 
this
sent her pulse racing. Ryu looked down at her, expecting her to return the 
look,
but Shampoo couldn&#39;t get her eyes off her womanhood. This was enough for Ryu
to end her tears and break a little smile on her face.

In a far kinder voice, she spoke. &quot;Xian....you put on my Stars?&quot;

Shampoo breaks out of her daze and quickly gets to her feet.
&quot;Wh...what? Oh...yes. I did put them on.&quot;

&quot;But...Xian....surely Kiki would have told you what would happen. Didn&#39;t she 
tell
you that I would capture you? Imprison you here in your own mind, while I 
use your
body?&quot;

Shampoo looks to the ground.
&quot;She said a lot of things about you...good things as well as bad.&quot;
Shampoo looks Ryu in the eyes again.
&quot;...she said you could help cure me of my curse...&quot;

&quot;Oh....&quot; Muttered Ryu, kind of upset. &quot;Is that you wanted me for?&quot;

Shampoo was taken back a little, she didn&#39;t want to hurt *this* Ryu&#39;s 
feelings.
&quot;I&#39;m sorry! I didn&#39;t mean it that way. I want to find out a lot about you.
Ryu....before tonight.....before all of this....I studied your work....
..I used it to make my Airens so happy....you...you&#39;re sort of a hero to 
me.&quot;

Ryu looked Shampoo for several seconds and then inched closer, prompting the
young Amazon to back up. This simple act succeeded in upsetting her yet 
again.
&quot;I knew it...&quot; Whimpered Ryu, prepairing to cry again.

Shampoo couldn&#39;t stand to cause this kind of hurt. She dicided to get
brave, and so, she stroad quickly over to Ryu and began to embrace her.
Ryu stood, shocked while she felt the young Amazon&#39;s body pressed against 
her&#39;s.
Shampoo herself was in a similar state of shock, she couldn&#39;t believe what 
she
had just done, and even more so, she couldn&#39;t believe the feeling of Ryu&#39;s 
soft
chest pressed against her own.

Slowly, Ryu wraped her arms around Shampoo and returned the hold.
A tear now trickles from her, but for a good reason.

&quot;It has been so long....since someone has hugged me like that...even in a 
dream...&quot;

&quot;Why...why did you become evil Ryu? How could you do those things?&quot; Came 
Shampoo&#39;s
whispering voice from the other side of the embrace.

Ryu took hold of Shampoo&#39;s face and points it towards her own. She expected 
her
to say something, but all she did was smile and then bring them closer 
together.
She gently kissed her, further burning Shampoo&#39;s face with embarresment, and
now arousal while she could feel her nipples hardening.

Ryu could feel this too and just giggled. &quot;I tend to have that effect...&quot;
She joked while Shampoo tried her best to calm herself down.

&quot;Come Xian....sit with me.&quot;
Ryu takes hold of Shampoo sitting her down while supporing her behind with 
one of
her hands. This didn&#39;t help Shampoo&#39;s attempts to cool off.

They sat side-by-side. Both looking into the white haze.

&quot;This is the existence between life and death...&quot; She said wrapping an arm 
around
Shampoo&#39;s shoulder, holding her closer.

&quot;This is a &#39;Dream-scape&#39;. It can be anything to your heart&#39;s content.&quot;

The haze suddenly disappears, replaced by and endless forest, all around 
them.
The air was warm with a gentle breeze flowing through trees.
Their legs now dipped into a small pond of cool water.

Shampoo sat, transfixed on all this.

&quot;Oh! It&#39;s all so lovely...almost like-&quot;

&quot;-Heaven?&quot; Butted-in Ryu.

Shampoo now looked at her, not sure what to think.

&quot;Not all Ghosts live like this Xian. And for a while, neither did I. This is 
only
possible for those who share a dream. Like those dreams I gave you and your
airens.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care if it was a trick Ryu. I love them....my feelings are real. 
Akane and
Ukyo are part of me now....that will never change.&quot;

Ryu simply smiles. &quot;I would hope so, I merely awoke something that was 
already there.
I am sure it was the Godesses&#39; will for you to be with Ukyo......and 
Akane...&quot;
Ryu sighs outloud and then looks down, while kicking the water with her 
feet.

&quot;How I envy you Xian...she loves you.....I am a monster to her...&quot;
Another tear drops from her eye.

&quot;This is all because of Ama....isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Ryu remains mute for a moment and then replies. &quot;I wanted to die with her so 
much....
...I made the link so we would...but...she died so young...&quot; The tears come 
back again.
&quot;I...I told her the Jusenkyo valley was dangerous.....but she knew....my 
favourite
flower grew there.....she was always such a talented flower-girl. She would 
fill the
village with colour and fragrance....but.....but....she climbed the 
valley-side....
...the flowers grew there.....and...she 
slipped........fell............into.......
....a Jusenkyo Spring.......and drowned in it&#39;s waters...........with my 
favourite flowers
still clenched in her hand.&quot;

Ryu breaks down into tears again while Shampoo sits there shocked at this 
relevation.

[9]=========================================================================

&quot;Ama? The....Spring.....of the Drowned-....AIYA! That&#39;s not possible!! 
I...thought
it was just a curse!!&quot;

Ryu&#39;s tears end, and after she sniffles a little, she replies.
&quot;It&#39;s not a curse....it never was....&quot;

Shampoo just stares at her.

&quot;...*I* created the Jusenkyo Springs.&quot;

The young Amamzon nearly jumps out of her skin.

&quot;YOU?!!! You created the curse?!!&quot;

&quot;NO!!&quot; Snapped Ryu. &quot;It&#39;s not a curse...It&#39;s...a resting place.&quot;

Shampoo calms down a little on hearing this. &quot;They&#39;re...graves?&quot;

&quot;Not just any grave. It is a resting place for the body AND ghost. Before 
Ama....I had few
human friends. I lived with nature, my friends were animals. They were like 
pets to me.
When each of them died I gave them a place to sleep forever, a place where 
their ghost
would always live in a DreamScape..until I could join them, as a ghost.
I had many pets, a Panda Bear, a duck-&quot; A smile now broke Ryu&#39;s face again. 
&quot;-even a
little piggy...and-&quot;

They are interrupted by the sound of a cat mewing a short distance behind 
them.
They both look behind.

&quot;Ki?&quot; Called Ryu into the shadows of the nearby trees. &quot;Ki? Is that you?&quot;
Shampoo had no clue of who or what Ryu was talking to, until she saw a small 
shadow move
from behind a nearby tree. There had been no end of surprises for Shampoo in 
this dream,
but this had to be the most breathtaking of them all.

From the shadows came a white cat which, apart from the &#39;hairstyle&#39;, looked 
identical to
the cat she became on touching cold water.

The little preditor immeadatly recognised her old master and pounced towards 
her waiting arms.
Ryu embraced the purring feline, her grip as strong as her joy, while 
Shampoo watched.

&quot;That&#39;s...that&#39;s me.......but why is she? Why is? Why....&quot; Stammered the 
Amazon Girl.

&quot;Confused Xian?&quot; Whispered Ryu through the purring.

A simple nod was her reply.

&quot;You distrubed her grave Xian. I imagine you fell into one of my springs...&quot;

&quot;The Spring of the Drowned Cat. I fell in while training with my Great 
Grandmother......
..I thought it was a curse.....it sure is when your first Airen is 
frightened of cats...&quot;
Lamented Shampoo, her head sinking a little.

&quot;Drowned Cat? Oh....oh yes....I did &#39;call&#39; it that, didn&#39;t I?&quot;

Shampoo gaved a muted look to Ryu. What was she talking about?

&quot;Those springs are not that deep. Do you really think my Panda could drown 
there too?&quot;
Her answer was met with more silence.
&quot;Only my poor Ama drowned in one of the springs.&quot; Continued Ryu with a tear 
in her eye.
&quot;-The Spring of the Drowned Cat is the grave of my little Ki here. She was 
my favourite
cat and when she died I buried her there. The curses Xian...are a legend I 
invented to
keep people from distrubing the graves. And until reciently, that&#39;s exactly 
what&#39;s happened.
Ki&#39;s ghost rested until your own ghost disturbed the waters. Your ghosts 
fused as one inside
your living body.&quot;

Shampoo nearly fell into the lake upon hearing this. &quot;That cat has been 
*haunting* me for years?!
But....but....I would of known...surely....and....if she&#39;s just a 
ghost...why do I-&quot;

&quot;-change into her?&quot; Said Ryu, completing her sentence with a knowing smile. 
The Amazon&#39;s mood
had improved now that her &#39;old friend&#39; was now curled up on her lap.
&quot;She hides in your *dreams* Xian. She has always been there, just below the 
surface. That&#39;s why
when you change into her body, you know how to use it. The fusion of souls 
is deep.
When you touch water as cold as the depths of her Jusenkyo Grave, her ghost 
comes forward
and her old body is reborn in you.
Water as hot as your blood brings your body back forward to be reborn in the
same way. It is like Jing and Jang, Male and Female, Life and Death, 
Body.....and Soul.&quot;

Shampoo looked into the endless waters of the lake beside them, letting this 
sink in. It had
been a deep feeling seeded in her heart all these years since her accident 
that something was
different. That even at her lowest ebb, even after Ranma&#39;s constant 
rejections and the lonely
weekends where she sobbed at the fact that all were against her, she could 
feel something or
someone was still with her, keeping her company in spirit at least.

It was then that a startling relisation came to the young Amazon.

&quot;When you saw my Ranma....as a girl....you thought she was....&quot;

&quot;-Ama.&quot; Ryu had beaten her to the punch again.

An exicited look now filled Shampoo&#39;s eyes. Could it be true? Could her 
Airen actually be half
of the legendary couple?

Ryu&#39;s soft smile seemed to confirm this.

&quot;The hair-colour was enough to raise my suspicions when I first saw you 
girls with her,
but then seeing into the male eyes of your airen, and then the female 
eyes.....I could see
her, she had been sleeping within him. Her fire-red hair has come to surface 
on his head,
she has awoken. I am sure of it. I had finally found her-&quot;

The dried up rivers on her cheeks now began to flow some more. &quot;-The hateful 
side of myself
had died when I felt her ghost again....her kiss killed that evil woman I 
was....now I can
assume my fate....my punishment. Eternal Imprisonment with this Jade prison 
I made.&quot;

[10]=====================================================================================

With a smile of determination, Ryu gently hands Ki to Shampoo and then 
raised to her feet
again. She now began to slowly walk away. A seering pain stabbed Shampoo in 
the heart.
She couldn&#39;t just let Ryu condem herself like this. There were other 
ways...and above all,
there was something....else now.

Shampoo jumped to her feet. &quot;Wait! Ryu!&quot; Choaked Shampoo, her emotions 
flowing high.

Ryu turned and looked back at the girl. All she could see were her watery 
eyes and a look
that had see before....in Ama.

&quot;Xian?&quot; She uttered softly.

&quot;Ryu....you...you deserve happiness! You deserve to be back with her! I 
can&#39;t let you put
yourself into another endless nightmare! You suffered as much as your 
victims.....&quot;

Shampoo was openly sobbing now, this had upset her in a way she hadn&#39;t 
expected.

&quot;You&#39;re good Ryu!! You&#39;re kind and caring! If you....if you really deserved 
punishment....
you would have tried to take me prisoner! Just like Kiki!! 
I...I....i....wo.....wo....&quot;

Shampoo fell to her knees, as if she were to spill her heart onto the grass.

&quot;...wo.....WO AI NI!!!!&quot;

Ryu stood there in silence. It had been so long since she heard those words 
spoken for her
willingly. Shampoo&#39;s continued sobbing, just served to confirm this.

Hesident at first, Ryu took some steps back to Shampoo, and then some more. 
Before long she
was right up at her sobbing head. Shampoo didn&#39;t notice her presence until 
she felt a soft
hand caress her tear filled cheek. Ryu had knelt down to face her with a 
smile warmer than
any before it.

Apart from a few sniffles, Shampoo fell silent, lost in the pair of eyes 
staring back at her.

Gently guiding her by the cheek, Ryu brought Shampoo back to her feet again. 
She rested both
her hands on the girl&#39;s now shivering shoulders. Shampoo was terrified now, 
she had just let
a ton feelings out, and Ryu&#39;s actions had now frightened her. She could only 
imagine what
would come next.

Slowly Ryu slid her hands down, carressing the girl&#39;s arms and then hips. 
She wrapped her arms
around Shampoo, trapping her in an embrace, and bringing their heads close 
to one-another.
They could now feel each other&#39;s hearts pounding against their chests in 
excitment.

Shampoo just stood, mesmurised by these eyes which seemed to bewitch her 
while Ryu carressed
her hair with one of her hands.

&quot;Wo ai ni....Xian&quot; Whispered Ryu, sending Shampoo&#39;s heart racing further.

Shampoo felt that this deserved a response, but her lips were quivering too 
much, she just
stammered some nonsense. Ryu simply hushed her, closed her own eyes and then 
inched closer.

A cocktail of emotion filled the girl&#39;s veins when she saw those lips draw 
closer to her own.
There was nothing she could do, except experience it and so she closed her 
eyes in time to feel
Ryu&#39;s kiss which took her with the kind of skill she had never felt before. 
The was a
contraction of a kiss, both powerful and gentle.

It lasted only a moment, but it felt like an age. When Ryu finished, she 
drew her head back
a little, and then smiled at the awe-struck face that looked back.
Shampoo tried to string some noises together to make a word, but was quickly 
hushed
by Ryu, who then whispered something very softly under her breath.

She kissed Shampoo on the cheek, the Kiss of Death.

Shampoo was Ryu&#39;s newest Airen.

A warmth filled the young Amazon&#39;s veins, a warmth she had felt when she 
first became one
with Akane and Ukyo. Her love had made her weak in the knees and now she was 
Ryu&#39;s.

The undead Amazon took hold of her new Girlfriend and lowered her to the 
grass.
She lay over Shampoo pressing their bodies together, feeling eachother&#39;s 
warmth,
and each other&#39;s hearts...still pounding.

They remained silent while they looked into each other&#39;s twinkling eyes.
Shampoo could bearly handle the endless darkness of Ryu&#39;s orbs. Inside
she could see the primal force of her love hiding inside, coated in the
countless years of experience this woman had. In a way, Shampoo was 
terrified,
because all of this was directed right at her. She could only imagine what 
Ryu
could see in her. She felt that her soul was as naked as her body with this 
woman.

This all felt like a loving fight for supremicy. Which one could learn the 
most
from their eyes? But Shampoo was only young, she couldn&#39;t possibly stand up 
to
this ancient witch-doctor. So she blinked, surrendering herself yet again to
Ryu. A smile engulfed the Amazon&#39;s face, she knew she had won her Xian yet 
again,
and now she wished to take a another kiss as her prize.

Lowering her head yet again, Ryu closed those endless eyes of hers and 
puckered
up for another electric kiss.

Shampoo saw this coming, a got herself ready...but then something happened.
A torrent of guilt now filled her heart. How could she do this? How could 
she
willingly submit to such a betrayal.

&quot;Ryu...please stop.&quot;

Ryu stopped her lips just short of Shampoo&#39;s, and opened her eyes in 
surprise.
&quot;Xain? What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

A tears now tricked from Shampoo&#39;s eyes. &quot;I...I...I just cheated on them....
...Akane...Ukyo....Ranma....I...I love you Ryu....but...I betrayed my 
Airens...
...I&#39;m so selfish!&quot;

Shampoo looked away, disgusted with herself.

&quot;Oh Xian....&quot; Whispered Ryu while stroaking the girl&#39;s hair. &quot;...have you
forgotten all our teachings so quickly? Love is something that is shared...
...and if you will have me I wish to share it with all of you...&quot;

The young Amazon looked back in surprise. What could this mean?

&quot;What do you mean by that? How could you share your love?&quot;

Grinning, Ryu continued: &quot;You know I love Akane....and...oh...Ukyo....she&#39;s
so....well, you would know better then me...&quot;

Shampoo blushed at this, knowing *exactly* what she was talking about.

&quot;But...how can you love my Airens too? They are frightned of the 
Stars...just
as I was...&quot; Uttered Shampoo, while her guilt began to fade a little.

&quot;Xian...I cannot take control of you like Kiki...at least not by force.....
...if you....if you were to share yourself....let me live in your dreams....
...just like Ki...I could watch you life, and when you sleep, we would be 
lovers
in your dreams...and...if you let me....we could trade places for a short 
while..
...then I could love them.....then.....I could rejoin with Ama.....&quot;

This was a lot of the young girl to take in, and put together with 
everything that
had happened so far, it was nearly too much.

Ryu continued: &quot;...also...if I take Ki&#39;s place....the &#39;Cat Curse&#39; will no 
longer
take effect. You can touch cold water without fear....but I know, I 
kidnapped
and nearly raped you and your airens...there is no reason you should trust 
me.&quot;

&quot;...how....how can you do this....how do we join...?&quot; Asked Shampoo meekly,
her choice had clearly been made.

Ryu&#39;s heart jumped with happiness while she held onto her new airen even 
tighter.
&quot;You will do it?!!&quot; Exclaimed Ryu. &quot;You will join with me willingly?&quot;

&quot;Yes...I will....&quot; Answered the younger Amazon, unusually shy.

&quot;But...Xian....you must know....once I do this it cannot be reversed....
...for this kind of link to work....are souls will be so close...every dream 
we
will share...you will also love anyone I love...&quot;

Smiling, Shampoo answered. &quot;Ama is Ranma...I should love her already....and
if every dream I have is like *this*...it would be heaven for me...&quot;

They stare at eachother in silence for a while, their happiness had frozen 
them.

&quot;Well?&quot; Added Shampoo after a long pause. &quot;-*How* do we link?&quot;

&quot;Only one way....&quot; Replyed Ryu with a grin. &quot;-we must mate.&quot;

A current of emotion flowed once more in the head of the young Amazon. In a 
way
she had expected this, very little of her people&#39;s ways didn&#39;t become 
sexual.
The tingle of anticipation sparked all the way down to the tips of her toes,
while Ryu took her into another kiss. She could feel the elegant ballet of 
Ryu&#39;s
tongue dancing in her mouth in a move she had practiced since her first 
period.
It was an Engaging Kiss, a kiss she had used successfully to seduce her 2
newest airens, and intended to prepare the reciever for sex.

Shampoo&#39;s own imagination now boiled her blood further, now she could 
imagine what
Ryu would do to her, and the thought of this body making love to her own
both excited and frightened her. Then that fear took hold...this woman 
wasn&#39;t her
airens...she was far older, far more experienced...and said to be the 
greatest
lover that ever was...the scrolls she read were proof enough of that.

She could then feel Ryu speed up, massaging and groaping her with her own 
limbs,
and the kiss was so fast it nearly cut off her air. A cold sweat of panic 
coated
Shampoo&#39;s already moist skin.

She broke the kiss, gasping for air, while Ryu lay baffled.

&quot;Is everything alright Xian? I didn&#39;t hurt you did I?&quot;
Ryu then saw the fear in eyes of her new lover.
&quot;Xian....you&#39;re...terrified...&quot; Whisered Ryu while cradling the girl&#39;s 
cheek.
&quot;...what has made you so afraid?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s...&quot; Shampoo hesitated. &quot;...you...you&#39;re the greatest lover we&#39;ve ever 
had...
.....I&#39;ve studied your techniques...they&#39;re so powerful...but I&#39;m not 
Ama....
..I gave myself Love-Sickness last time I tried...anything you can do...I&#39;m 
afraid
that it will be too powerful...I&#39;m afraid I won&#39;t be able to cope with the 
feelings
...I-&quot;

She&#39;s interruped by Ryu giggling out-load.

&quot;-What? I&#39;m afraid! It&#39;s not funny!!&quot;

Ryu continued to giggle playfully. &quot;So *that* is what&#39;s bothering you? 
You&#39;re
afraid you cannot handle the Tetotiko I&#39;ll give you when we mate?-&quot;
She giggles some more, much to Shampoo&#39;s embarresment.
&quot;-that is so cute Xian. Reminds me of my first mate with Ama...she was so
nervious! Xian....Ama never trained to be my lover...in the end...I was just
a girl like her with the same bits and pieces....although two bits of her&#39;s 
were much
bigger than mine......anyway......we took our time and loved Xian.....
..I never made her Love-Sick...by accident...&quot;

Blushing, Shampoo answered- &quot;Ryu...I&#39;m ashamed of it...I waited so long 
after the
Initiation Rite to first mate.....If you must know....it was just over a 
week ago.&quot;

&quot;If you *must* know Xian...&quot; Ryu inched closer to whisper in her lover&#39;s 
ear.
&quot;(...Ama lost her innocence to me.....a year older than you.)&quot;

A smile broke on the face of the younger Amazon, she had never know this and
this news bolstered her self-esteem even more.

&quot;-please don&#39;t tell anyone Xian. It would really embarress her. It may not
matter much to the Devil-Islanders but-&quot;

&quot;I know...I know...no Amazon will know...&quot;

&quot;Good...now my Little Tikada...want to think about relaxing and let me 
finish what
I started?&quot;

Shampoo nodded meekly. &quot;But please tell me what technique you&#39;ll use...&quot;

&quot;Technique? Must I use something so detailed? No. I will love you like I 
first
loved *her*. With my heart and with my body.&quot;

Inching her mouth closer to Shampoo&#39;s ear she whispered yet again.
&quot;(Just let yourself go Xian....clear your mind....and forget all that is 
wrong.)&quot;

Soothed by Ryu&#39;s soft voice that tickled her ear, she closed her eyes and
let herself go limp. Ryu centred herself over Shampoo again, pressing their 
bodies
together, she now took hold of her arms and streched them out to the 
top-left
and top-right. Then with her legs, she spread Shampoo&#39;s apart so that all 
limbs
faced in 4 directions.

&quot;This a Star Position. It will channel your energy better.&quot; Utters Ryu 
before
planting a light kiss on the girl&#39;s mouth.

&quot;When my love causes the Tetotiko, I will become one with the energy you 
release.
Then I will be one with you....we will never be alone again....&quot;

Those last words echoed throughout the young Amazon&#39;s mind for countless 
minutes.

The sound of the leaves rustling on the overhead trees now replaced 
everthing else.

Shampoo&#39;s mind began to empty....



She felt herself drifting, the world was leaving her....she could bearly 
feel Ryu
anymore....



It was just a haze now....



&quot;(Can you hear me Xian?)&quot; Came a familiar whisper, which sounded distant.



&quot;Ryu.....what is happening?&quot;



&quot;(Shhhhh.....give yourself to it...)&quot;



She began to feel light kisses now moving down her torso.



&quot;You already began? Or has it ended? I can only feel your kisses Ryu...&quot;



Silence.



Her vulva was now being kissed....she could feel Ryu&#39;s tongue within her....



&quot;(Aiya)...this is so.....so......different.....&quot;



A pair of hands were now carressing her.



&quot;......Ryu.......&quot;



&quot;(Hush....this is a primal force Xian....it comes without thinking.....)&quot;



Shampoo lay silent.....



And then she could feel it...the familiar warmth of her arousal.....it 
wouldn&#39;t
be long now....




It was an eternity of anticipation for her....how would it feel at the end?
Would it be as good as it felt now? She wished this feeling wouldn&#39;t 
end.....
...each kiss....each invasion of the tongue....felt like a link with the 
woman....
....she could almost hear her thoughts.




&quot;Ryu......it&#39;s happening isn&#39;t it?&quot;





A powerful wave of feeling rippled through her veins.....




&quot;Ay...ia......this....is......I....that&#39;s too strong I can&#39;t....&quot;



&quot;(Yes you can....)&quot;



&quot;I&#39;ll die.....of pleasure...too strong.....&quot;


&quot;(I&#39;ll never hurt you.......you can do it.....you can feel this....)&quot;


&quot;But I-&quot;






Her heart stopped.





None of what she had done with Ukyo could have prepared her for it.
She fought as hard as she could to get Ryu to stop....but in the end,
it came for her. What warning she had wasn&#39;t enough, and when it struck
her down every last fiber of her being froze.

She wanted to scream, but she couldn&#39;t breath...

The tsunami hit her and then returned to where it began. She was now left
with a feeling which lingered wonderfully.

Her fear was replaced with joy....Ryu had made love to her.


The undead Amazon, now appeared over her again, bearly visable in the white 
light.

&quot;I knew you could....&quot; She said with a smile. &quot;...now we are one.&quot;

She lowered her head down to the teary-eyed girl.

Their lips touched-

==============================================================================
[11]==========================================================================
==============================================================================

Shampoo&#39;s eye&#39;s eased open. It took only a moment for her to focus on what 
was
around her, and now she could feel two pairs of familiar arms supporting 
her.
Close to her were the worried faces of Akane and Ukyo looking down.

&quot;Shampoo...&quot; Sobbed Akane while a small tear traveled down her cheek.

&quot;Oh....Sugarpoo...please tell me you&#39;re ok....&quot; Came an equally emotive 
Ukyo.

The young Amazon just smiled back for a moment, content with lying in their 
hold
like this. An enternity had passed since she first entered the dream,
An hour of hell for her fretful lovers who kept vigil, watching her moves
and convulsions. Ranma remained silent and distant. Not wanting to not
look macho, she maintained calm, but inside, she was worried for her
Amazon grilfriend.

Kiki sat silently, slightly guilty, slighty afraid. What had she just done?
Will this be ok? Or will it end in disaster.

&quot;Are you ok Sugar?&quot; Asked Ukyo while mothering Shampoo.

Whispering she replied. &quot;Ryu pain ending now...Ryu is not alone.
Shampoo is cured.&quot;

&quot;Does she control you?&quot; Asked Kiki now, placing a terrible tone onto the
conversation.

Turning, Shampoo gained more strenght and could sit up.
&quot;Ryu was too too weak. But Ryu find what she looking for. Ryu is like 
before,
before Ama died. Ryu feels guilty, and wanted to end life, but Shampoo 
change
this. Shampoo is free of cat-curse, and Ryu will live in Shampoo dreams.&quot;

There was no doubt that this was Shampoo talking and not the undead Amazon.
But this didn&#39;t put Akane at ease. Somewhere inside this girl she loved
dwelled that monster which &#39;loved&#39; her. This sent a shiver down her spine,
which could only be thawed by Shampoo&#39;s warm smile when she looked back
at her youngest Airen, It seemed that her love was more powerful than her 
fear.

Early morning was fast approaching Nerima and the girl&#39;s chance to go home 
unseen
was slipping away. They dared not walk the streets dressed only in a loose 
sheet.

Leaving their captives where they sat, the group left together and began to 
walk
through the fields toward the storm channel. But on the way, Shampoo 
stopped,
beside them was a small lake in the centre of an old corn field.

This stall was noticed and everyone turned to see Shampoo look at it&#39;s 
waters
longingly. Uyko moves over to her and then feels the water with the back of 
her
hand.

&quot;It&#39;s pretty cold sugar....are you sure?&quot; She asked knowing what the Amazon 
was
thinking. A small nod was the only reply she got.

&quot;Well ok sugar...but don&#39;t stay too long, you&#39;ll catch your death and we-&quot;

Ukyo was cut short by Kiki gesturing her over. Confused, Ukyo obeyed and
huddled around Kiki with the others.

Kiki whispered to them. &quot;I think we should leave her alone for this...&quot;
With that, they silenly moved away with Akane and Ukyo longingly looking 
back to
her..

Shampoo&#39;s sheet fell to the ground. She stood for a moment and let the
wind massage her naked skin before she moved. She stroad gracefully to the 
water&#39;s
edge. She let the spray of it carress her, and felt it&#39;s coldness.

Filling her lungs with a large breath, she lunged forward and gracefully 
flew into
the lake with the eligance of an Olympic diver. With a small slash, she 
disappeared
beneath it&#39;s waters.

A moment passed and then another.

She broke the surface again....as a girl. A joy filled her heart which felt 
as stong
as the water was cold. She was finally free of the curse.
The chill of the water felt like victory, and the thought of feeling this 
with her skin
again nearly moved her to tears. She had missed this so much.

She took full advantage of this moment and swan to her hearts content, 
before floating
on her back to rest. It was then that her ear-rings shone again.

&quot;Xian,...&quot; Came a voice from within her.

&quot;Ryu....this is so wonderful...I thought I would never feel this again....&quot;

&quot;We are one Xian....Everything will be wonderful from now on...&quot;

&quot;....I hope that nothing will ever ruin it......&quot;

Darkness.

In the center of the room, a beautiful woman knelt praying, surrounded by 
only light.
She wore an eloborite Kimono-like dress and had various tattoos on her 
forearms. Her
hair was long a like silk.

Something startles her. Breaths heavily and then opens her eyes.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Asked a male voice from the darkness.

&quot;A disturbance....&quot; She whispered. &quot;..someone has joined with her....her 
true self has
re-awoken.&quot;

The man moves forward into the light. He is tall, bald and wears a black 
suit and shades.

&quot;Where?&quot; He snapped with a gruff voice.


&quot;...an Amazon.......a Chef.....a Tendo................Nerima...&quot;
