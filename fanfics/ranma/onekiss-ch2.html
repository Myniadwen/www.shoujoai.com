<h1>One Little Kiss (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/onekiss-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>	Shampoo didn&#39;t understand the Japanese.

	They seemed to value the exact opposite of all she had been 
taught to value back home in China.

	And they also had this problem with nudity.

	It tended to make them nervous or upset. She had already 
discovered that when she first tried to bathe with her Airen back home 
in Joketsuzoku and then when she wanted to sleep with him naked and 
in the same bed. Both of which seemed like all too simple wants in 
Shampoo&#39;s opinion.
	
	After all, Ranma was her Airen. Why shouldn&#39;t she bathe and 
sleep with him? But Ranma saw things differently.

	Because he was Japanese.

	It was entirely frustrating for Shampoo but she had eventually 
accepted that she couldn&#39;t bathe with him. She also had to accept that 
she could sleep next to him but not with him. The most annoying thing 
she had to accept was the fact that she couldn&#39;t sleep in the nude 
anymore.

	But Shampoo had accepted all the things she couldn&#39;t do 
because Ranma was Japanese and very slowly moved on.

	Through her grumbling acceptance Shampoo was considered 
a friend by Ranma. And Shampoo soon learned that for her to be 
considered his friend was a truly great thing. There were very few 
people that Ranma trusted and now she was one of them. And that 
was a good enough place for her to start in her opinion.

	For now.

	But apparently Akane didn&#39;t understand their friendship 
because when she opened up the door to the guest room and saw 
Shampoo sleeping next to Ranma she had taken it rather badly. Well, 
perhaps loudly would be a better description because of the volume of 
Akane&#39;s scream.

	Yes, Akane had taken it very loudly.

	Or at least her lungs had.

	Being woken up by Akane screaming her head off and calling 
her Airen a pervert wasn&#39;t pleasant for Shampoo.

	No, it wasn&#39;t pleasant at all. But the entire experience had 
taught Shampoo something very important though.

	She still didn&#39;t understand the Japanese.

---

	&quot;I hate school,&quot; Ranma muttered under his breath.

	It was a statement that he held as an absolute truth deep in his 
heart. Saotome Ranma truly did hate school. And why did he hate 
school so much?

	Well, for one very simple reason.

	Every time he went to school it always caused him trouble. 
There hadn&#39;t been one time in Ranma&#39;s entire life that him attending 
school hadn&#39;t led to trouble. It was like school and Ranma together 
equaled trouble.

	It was all written in the stars or in his genetics or in something 
like that. Either way, it was written.

	Ranma + School = Trouble.

	He knew this to be true. It had already started. Ranma had 
been splashed with water on the way to school by a little old lady and 
when they went to some clinic Akane knew of to get him some hot 
water, Ranma had been scared half to death by the clinic&#39;s doctor and 
his pet skeleton.

	And what was that guy&#39;s name anyway? It was doctor 
something about food...

	Doctor Twinkie? Hell, he didn&#39;t know. All Ranma knew was 
that the doctor had scared the crap out of him.

	So school was trouble for Ranma. At least that&#39;s what he 
thought as he slowly made his way to Furinkan High with the usually 
quiet Akane and Shampoo.

	He was a bit surprised that Shampoo was so eager to attend 
school. Ranma figured that she would want to do it but mainly to just 
be with him. Her reaction this morning had proved him wrong though. 
Shampoo seemed excited about the prospect of attending school. 
Saying that it was a good chance for her to learn about what she 
called, &quot;The much strange and stupid Japanese ways of thinking.&quot;

	It sort of disturbed Ranma that Shampoo was so happy to go 
to school. He couldn&#39;t understand it. Akane he could understand a 
little bit more.

	Even if Akane was a violent girl who overreacted about 
strangest things she at least was just as unenthusiastic as he was about 
going to school. Ranma could relate to that and therefore he found 
himself relating to Akane.

	Granted, Ranma was only relating to her on a small 
microscopic level but he was still relating to her. And if their fathers 
knew about it they&#39;d probably burst into tears of pure happiness on 
finding out about this minimal connection.

	Of course, they tended to overreact just a bit.

	Especially Soun, whom Ranma felt was responsible at least 
partially for Akane&#39;s overly violent tendencies. It seemed to him that 
Soun cried just as much as Akane acted violent so there had to be a 
connection there.

	Like father, like daughter but skewered in their particular 
reactions to certain things maybe?

	Either way, they both overreacted about things.

	Ranma figured that it had to be genetic.

	&quot;Aiyaah,&quot; Shampoo breathed in shocked tones. &quot;Why big mob 
of much strange Japanese boys run this way?&quot;

	Snapping out of his musings, Ranma followed the direction of 
Shampoo&#39;s gaze and his eyes widened at what he saw ahead. It was 
indeed a big mob of boys that were both Japanese and strange as all 
of them held various weapons which they were waving around in the 
air.

	&quot;What the heck?&quot; asked Ranma softly.

	Before he could say anything more on the matter, Akane went 
barreling forward as she gave another one of her loud screams while 
she trounced the mob of boys. Ranma and Shampoo watched this go 
on as they stood frozen in the front entrance to Furinkan High.

	&quot;Airen,&quot; said Shampoo after a long moment. &quot;Is this special 
Japanese martial arts training?&quot;

	&quot;Eh... I dunno,&quot; Ranma said vaguely as he scratched the back 
of his head. &quot;But whatever it is, it sure is weird.&quot;

	&quot;Akane more skilled that Shampoo thought,&quot; said Shampoo 
who was watching the fight closely now. Akane had already defeated 
over half of her mob opponents and barely a minute had passed. &quot;Is 
impressive.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ranma murmured. &quot;Sure is. But why in the world is 
she fighting all of these guys anyway?&quot;

	Shampoo shrugged in way of reply and adjusted her 
backpack as she said, &quot;Maybe is like Amazon laws? They defeat 
Akane in battle to go on date?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; snorted Ranma. &quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s it, Shampoo. 
We do things a lot differently here in Japan.&quot;

	&quot;Shampoo know this,&quot; said Shampoo in annoyance. &quot;You is 
doing things the stupid way here in Japan.&quot;

	&quot;Aw man, Shampoo,&quot; Ranma said wearily. &quot;Y&#39;know that I 
didn&#39;t mean it like that. Why do you gotta be so--&quot;

	&quot;Ranma! Shampoo!&quot;

	Blinking at this sudden interruption, Ranma averted his eyes to 
look at Nabiki who was waving from one of the third story windows 
inside the school.

	&quot;You two better just go inside,&quot; advised Nabiki as her husky 
voice sailed across the campus. &quot;Akane does this every morning. 
You&#39;ll just be late if you wait for her to finish.&quot;

	&quot;She look finish to Shampoo,&quot; called Shampoo in dry tones as 
she pointed to Akane who was breathing heavily and stood 
surrounded by a pile of unconscious boys.

	Walking forward, Ranma gave a small smile as he slung his 
backpack over his shoulder. &quot;Hey Akane,&quot; he began slowly. &quot;That 
was pretty good.&quot;

	&quot;What?&quot; Akane asked as she turned around. She pushed a 
stray strand of hair out of her eyes and said, &quot;Oh it&#39;s you, Ranma. Why 
didn&#39;t you just go inside?&quot;

	&quot;I wanted to watch the fight,&quot; said Ranma with a shrug. &quot;You 
sure showed those guys, but what was it about?&quot;

	Akane was about to reply when suddenly a low voice 
interrupted, &quot;You there! Who are you that would dare speak to Tendo 
Akane without permission?&quot;

	Ranma turned to look at a tall and handsome boy who had a 
bokken pointed at him. Blinking at this, Ranma opened his mouth to 
reply when the boy cut him off.

	&quot;Wait!&quot; the boy announced. &quot;Is it not proper to give one&#39;s 
name first? Very well, I shall. I am Kuno Tatewaki, age seventeen, 
and undefeated Captain of the Kendo club. Also known to many as 
the Blue Thunder of Furinkan High!&quot;

	As if on cue, the sound of thunder and a lone streak of 
lightning crossed the sky as it darkened considerably.

	Shampoo looked up at this and immediately pulled out the 
umbrella that she always carried for Ranma&#39;s sake. Besides, the 
umbrella did make a decent weapon at times.

	&quot;Uhm... okay...&quot; said Ranma slowly. He rubbed the back of 
his head and said, &quot;And I&#39;m Saotome Ranma of the Anything Goes 
school of martial arts. Nice to meet you...?&quot;

	Kuno narrowed his eyes at this and lowered his bokken and 
said, &quot;You still have not told me why you&#39;re being so familiar with 
Akane.&quot;

	&quot;Kuno,&quot; said Akane with exasperation. &quot;We&#39;re going to be late 
for class. Can&#39;t we do this another time?&quot;

	Ignoring Akane&#39;s words, Kuno shifted his lidded gaze to 
Shampoo who was leaning against the umbrella. &quot;And who might you 
be, fair maiden?&quot; he asked in low tones.

	&quot;Name is Shampoo,&quot; replied Shampoo with a smile as she 
neared Ranma to hang slightly on his arm.

	Watching this motion, Kuno&#39;s eyes narrowed and he said, 
&quot;Very well, Akane. We shall settle this another time. I do not wish for 
you to be late for class.&quot;

	With that, Kuno turned on his heel to walk into the school as a 
crash of thunder sounded. Shampoo immediately pulled away from 
Ranma to open the umbrella and hold it over his head. Looking at 
Akane, she smiled and said, &quot;Not want get wet, join us under 
umbrella, Akane.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, okay,&quot; said Akane quietly as she moved closer to 
Shampoo as the three walked into the school as it started to rain. 
Looking at Shampoo, she finally said, &quot;How did you manage to do 
that?&quot;

	&quot;Do what?&quot; asked Shampoo.

	&quot;Get Kuno to leave us alone,&quot; Akane elaborated. &quot;I can 
normally never get that baka to stop bugging me.&quot;

	&quot;Is too easy,&quot; said Shampoo. &quot;Stupid boy obviously is thinking 
Ranma liking Akane so Shampoo show him different by giving 
affection to Airen. Now Ranma no is threat.&quot;

	&quot;Man,&quot; Ranma grumbled slightly. &quot;You didn&#39;t need to do that, 
Shampoo. I could&#39;ve beat that guy easy.&quot;

	&quot;I don&#39;t know, Ranma,&quot; said Akane as they entered the 
school. &quot;Kuno&#39;s actually a pretty good fighter.&quot;

	Ranma merely snorted at this while Shampoo closed the 
umbrella and said, &quot;Is true. Boy seemed like warrior.&quot;

	Giving a short shrug, Ranma headed up the stairs after Akane 
as he said, &quot;Maybe. But I still could&#39;ve beat him.&quot;

	&quot;Is so,&quot; said Shampoo with a smile.

---
	
	&quot;I swear Kuno baby,&quot; said Nabiki in her usual slow drawl. 
&quot;You pick fights for the strangest reasons. Why would you want to 
fight Ranma because he was talking to Akane?&quot;

	&quot;I had thought the knave was attempting to put himself above 
the declaration I had made,&quot; said Kuno. &quot;But it seems that he isn&#39;t 
interested in Akane&#39;s affections.&quot;

	&quot;Oh? And why do you say that?&quot; asked Nabiki.

	&quot;Because of the way he allowed the purple haired beauty to 
embrace him lovingly,&quot; Kuno said with satisfaction. 

	&quot;You mean Shampoo?&quot; said Nabiki. &quot;Of course he would, 
she&#39;s engaged to Ranma.&quot;

	&quot;Engaged?&quot; Kuno raised an eyebrow. &quot;Well now, that proves 
my point. If this Ranma character was after Akane he wouldn&#39;t allow 
such a thing.&quot;

	&quot;Maybe,&quot; Nabiki allowed. She studied Kuno with lidded eyes 
before a mischievous smile crossed her features and she said, &quot;But he&#39;s 
also engaged to Akane.&quot;

	There was a moment of silence before Kuno slowly turned 
towards Nabiki in a mechanical movement.

	&quot;HE&#39;S WHAT?!&quot;

	His loud shout echoed throughout the entire school and mere 
seconds later, Kuno found himself kicked out of his homeroom once 
again. But none of that mattered to Kuno.

	Especially not when he had his mind set on a mission. And his 
mind was set and his mission was clear.

	He must punish Saotome Ranma.

	Because after all, if anyone deserved to be with two such 
lovely girls as Akane and Shampoo, it was he Kuno Tatewaki and not 
that scoundrel Saotome Ranma.

	Then again, Kuno&#39;s logic was somewhat warped.

---

	&quot;Class meet Saotome Ranma and Shampoo...&quot; said Sensei 
Maeda, who trailed off as he looked at information sheet.

	&quot;Just Shampoo,&quot; said Ranma helpfully.

	Laughing slightly, Maeda said, &quot;Just Shampoo it is. They&#39;ve 
recently returned from China and--&quot;

	Before Maeda could say anything more, Kuno burst into the 
room and shouted, &quot;Saotome Ranma! How dare you engage yourself 
to both Akane and Shampoo! What sort of man does such a thing?!&quot;

	Ranma only had time to blink in confusion before Kuno hurled 
a bucket of cold water at him.

	Unfortunately for Ranma, he didn&#39;t have enough time or wits 
about him to dodge it and the reaction was instant as Ranma changed 
from a handsome black haired pigtailed boy into a kawaii red haired 
pigtailed girl.

	Staring at the transformed Ranma in certain shock, Kuno 
finally regained what little sense he had about him and pointing his 
bokken at Ranma, he shouted, &quot;It&#39;s as I thought! You&#39;re undeserving 
of both Akane and Shampoo! You&#39;re not even a man, Saotome! 
You&#39;re a crossdresser!&quot;

	&quot;What?!&quot; Ranma shouted in outrage. &quot;I&#39;m not a crossdresser, 
you stupid idiot! I&#39;m under a curse!&quot;

	&quot;Hmmph,&quot; Kuno sniffed. &quot;As many say but you cannot hide 
your perversion, Saotome. I shall rescue Akane and Shampoo from 
your treacherous grasp!&quot;

	Scowling at this, Ranma moved forward and looked Kuno 
straight in the eye as she said, &quot;You wanna fight? We&#39;ll fight but not 
right here, Kuno. We go outside.&quot;

	&quot;Very well,&quot; said Kuno. &quot;Then outside it shall be.&quot;

	With that, Ranma stalked out of the room with Kuno on her 
heels while the rest of the class stared at them.

	&quot;Aiyaah,&quot; Shampoo said after a long pause. &quot;This not good 
first day for Airen, I&#39;m thinking.&quot; She then dashed out of the door to 
the classroom leaving everyone else behind.

	Akane, who was still in shock from the current events, finally 
came out of it and growled, &quot;That baka Kuno! I&#39;m not his property! 
He&#39;s not going to get away with this!&quot;

	Then like Shampoo before her, Akane dashed out of the room 
to leave her classmates behind.

	Several seconds later those same classmates followed her out 
the door to leave a stunned Maeda alone.

	&quot;It seems that my students,&quot; began Maeda with a sigh. &quot;Are 
getting stranger each day.&quot;

---

	By the time that Shampoo and Akane arrived on the scene a 
large group of students had already gathered outside and Akane saw 
the familiar sight of Nabiki taking bets from all of the various 
observers.

	&quot;Nabiki,&quot; said Akane in slow almost dangerous tones as she 
approached her sister. &quot;You&#39;re behind this, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

	&quot;Moi? Would I do such a thing?&quot; asked Nabiki in innocent 
tones as she pressed a hand to her chest. For a reply Akane merely 
glared at her and Nabiki shrugged then said, &quot;So what if I did? Kuno 
baby was bound to find out about your engagement sooner or later. 
What&#39;s the harm in me making some money off it in the process?&quot;

	Groaning at this, Akane rubbed her forehead and said, &quot;The 
harm is that Kuno splashed Ranma in class! Now the whole school 
will know that I&#39;m engaged to a weirdo!&quot;

	&quot;Splashed him in class, huh?&quot; Nabiki murmured rather 
thoughtfully. Turning back to face the crowd, she produced a pile of 
booklets out of nowhere and shouted, &quot;Anyone who wants to know 
the story behind Saotome&#39;s curse can buy the official Jusenkyo 
explanation guides here!&quot;

	While Akane turned red faced at this, the crowd around 
Nabiki grew larger. Stalking away from her sister who was occupied 
with business, Akane rejoined Shampoo who was watching Ranma 
trying to explain her curse to Kuno.

	&quot;Listen, you blockhead,&quot; Ranma was saying. &quot;I&#39;m not a 
crossdresser. I got this curse that changes me into a girl when I&#39;m 
splashed with cold water. It ain&#39;t my fault!&quot;

	&quot;So you&#39;re insane as well as a crossdresser,&quot; Kuno said in 
disgusted tones. &quot;It&#39;s plain to see that I must eradicate both you and 
your foul ways before they sully the beauteous Tendo Akane and fair 
Shampoo.&quot; He then slashed his bokken through the air and said, 
&quot;Prepare yourself, crossdresser!&quot;

	At this point, Ranma was more than a little bit tired of 
constantly hearing pervert and crossdresser remarks.

	The battle with Kuno took approximately ten seconds as 
Ranma didn&#39;t even allow the other boy to start his attack as she 
proceeded to punch him a hundred and three times with a speed so 
quick that her arms seemed blurred.

	Two seconds later, Kuno collapsed with a loud thud.

	&quot;Huh,&quot; Ranma snorted as she dusted off her hands. &quot;He wasn&#39;t 
a challenge at all. Mousse is better than this guy.&quot;

	&quot;Airen!&quot; Shampoo called happily as she sidled up to Ranma 
and clutched to her arm. &quot;You beat stupid sword boy too too easy 
with Amaguriken. Great Grandmother be very proud of you if she 
could be seeing this.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Ranma with a grin. &quot;She would, wouldn&#39;t she? 
That technique is sure useful, Shampoo.&quot;

	&quot;How did you do that?&quot; asked Akane as she neared them 
while staring at the unconscious Kuno who had imprints of Ranma&#39;s 
fist all over his body.

	&quot;It was no big deal,&quot; Ranma dismissed. &quot;Just a technique that 
Shampoo&#39;s Great Grandmother taught me called the Kachu Tenshin 
Amaguriken. It&#39;s a speed based maneuver that helps accelerate your 
attacks. I bet that you could master it if you wanted to, Akane.&quot;

	&quot;Really?&quot; asked Akane. &quot;Is it hard?&quot;

	&quot;Nah,&quot; said Ranma as she walked towards the main building to 
Furinkan High with Shampoo and Akane at her sides. &quot;It&#39;s easy to 
master once you get used to the fire.&quot;

	Pausing at the entrance as Ranma and Shampoo entered the 
school, Akane repeated dimly, &quot;Fire?&quot;

---

	The wind blew across the empty yard to Furinkan High.

	Well, the somewhat empty yard since it had the figure of Kuno 
Tatewaki sprawled out in the middle of it staring up at the sky above 
with a blank expression.

	&quot;How did that crossdresser Saotome manage to defeat me so 
easily?&quot; Kuno mused. &quot;The Blue Thunder has never been bested 
before this instance.&quot;

	Furrowing his brow, Kuno thought long and hard.

	As long and hard as Kuno could think anyway.

	Pushing himself up and into a sitting position, Kuno exclaimed, 
&quot;I have it! That fiend Saotome is not only what you call a crossdresser 
but is also an evil sorcerer! Only with the aid of black magic could he 
defeat Kuno Tatewaki!&quot;

	And so, Kuno&#39;s delusions continued to live on.

---

	Akane watched Ranma and Shampoo balance the buckets of 
cold water on their heads and decided that both of them were weirdos 
instead of just Ranma.

	&quot;How can you two be so happy?&quot; Akane groused. &quot;We got 
into trouble for causing the whole class to leave the room and watch 
that fight of yours, Ranma.&quot; Turning to look at Ranma she said, &quot;And I 
don&#39;t need your help with Kuno. I can handle him fine on my own.&quot;

	&quot;I bet,&quot; said Ranma with a snort. &quot;And I wasn&#39;t fighting him for 
you. I was fighting him for insulting me.&quot;

	Akane frowned at this, and sensing another fight upcoming, 
Shampoo intervened with, &quot;Why stupid sword boy so upset over 
Airen, anyway? You no with him, is you?&quot;

	&quot;Me and Kuno?&quot; Akane sounded horrified. &quot;No way! He&#39;s the 
one who caused all of my problems with boys!&quot;

	&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; asked Ranma curiously. &quot;How&#39;s that?&quot;

	&quot;He made this stupid speech,&quot; began Akane with a grimace. 
&quot;And told everyone in the school that the only way they could go out 
with me was to defeat me in battle.&quot;

	&quot;Ha! Shampoo was right!&quot;

	Ranma and Akane slowly turned their attention to the lavender 
haired Amazon who looked sheepish. &quot;Sorry,&quot; said Shampoo. &quot;But 
Shampoo was right. Is like Amazon laws.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, I guess so,&quot; said Akane before she shook her head. 
&quot;Anyway, he told the entire school during this big assembly and now 
it&#39;s like a contest. They all want to defeat me just to be the one who 
does it.&quot; She paused then muttered, &quot;That&#39;s why I hate boys.&quot;

	There was a moment of silence before Ranma said, &quot;Bakas. 
No wonder you think guys are perverts.&quot;

	Blinking at this, Akane said, &quot;What?&quot;

	&quot;Those guys are bakas,&quot; Ranma continued. She folded her 
arms across her chest and said, &quot;And tomorrow I&#39;m gonna help you 
beat the crap out of them, Akane. Maybe if we team up on them we 
can beat them up so good they&#39;ll back off.&quot;

	&quot;I don&#39;t need your help,&quot; said Akane stubbornly as she turned 
her away from Ranma. &quot;I&#39;ve done fine on my own.&quot;

	&quot;Aw, man,&quot; said Ranma with a groan. &quot;You&#39;re just like 
Shampoo. Too damn stubborn.&quot;

	A moment later, Akane heard a loud thud and turned to look 
at Ranma who had a bonbori resting on the top of her head. &quot;What&#39;d 
you do that for Shampoo?&quot; Ranma complained.

	&quot;You just as stubborn as Shampoo or even more,&quot; Shampoo 
said with a sniff. &quot;Akane,&quot; said Shampoo as she tucked her bonbori 
back into wherever it came from. &quot;Airen say it wrong but was right. 
Shampoo help and we all beat up on annoying boys. Is good idea?&quot;

	Giving them a careful stare, Akane observed their easy and 
honest expressions in certain shock.

	When was the last time anyone was this nice to her?

	Years, maybe.

	&quot;Well,&quot; said Akane slowly. &quot;Okay, I guess.&quot;

	She would give Ranma and Shampoo a chance but she was 
still going to keep a close eye on them.

	Just in case they really were perverts.

---

	Nabiki was very happy.

	This was because she was doing her most favorite thing in the 
entire world.

	She was counting her profits for the day.

	Profits that had tripled since Saotome Ranma arrived at 
Furinkan High this morning.

	It was safe to say that even if Akane wasn&#39;t happy about her 
engagement to Ranma, it pleased Nabiki to no end.

	Now all she had to do was get some semi-risque pictures of 
Ranma and Shampoo to sell around the school.

	Already the pair were developing a fan following as many 
students were intrigued by both their personalities, past, and the fact 
that Ranma changed genders.
	
	If she managed to get some good pictures of them along with 
Akane she was sure her profits would quadruple.

	Today was turning out to be a good day for Nabiki and she 
was sure that with Ranma sticking around it could only get better.

	Better for her profits, that is.

---

	Frowning as she looked around the attic, Shampoo turned to 
Ranma and said, &quot;Explain again why Shampoo have to stay in empty 
place like this instead of with Airen?&quot;

	&quot;Aw, c&#39;mon Shampoo,&quot; Ranma said as he rubbed the back of 
his head. &quot;I already told you, it wouldn&#39;t be good for us to stay in the 
same room. They&#39;d get the wrong idea. And this is a really nice place. 
It just needs some stuff in it.&quot;

	&quot;So,&quot; Shampoo sniffed. &quot;You no want Shampoo to stay with 
you? You is tired of me already?&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s not like that,&quot; said Ranma with a sigh. &quot;I&#39;m just doing 
what&#39;s easier for everybody. You don&#39;t want Akane mad and yelling at 
us every morning do you? I figure the best way to get through this is to 
become friends with her.&quot;

	Frowning at this, Shampoo slowly looked at Ranma and said, 
&quot;Shampoo agree for Airen&#39;s sake but I not like it, Ranma. You be 
remembering this, won&#39;t you?&quot;

	&quot;You bet I&#39;ll remember,&quot; said Ranma as he gave a nervous 
smile and scratched his cheek. After Shampoo left the attic he said to 
himself, &quot;No way you&#39;d let me forget.&quot;

	&quot;I hear that, Airen!&quot;

	Wincing at this, Ranma said lowly, &quot;Oops.&quot;

---

	Akane felt confused.

	Was Ranma a pervert or wasn&#39;t he a pervert?

	He had run into her room naked that first day and that was 
perverted but the other boy had been chasing him.

	Then again, he hadn&#39;t done anything like that since then. He 
had insulted her though and that was a somewhat mean thing to do but 
it wasn&#39;t perverted.

	And he had offered to help her beat up those guys in the 
morning and seemed to understand about her plight. That certainly 
wasn&#39;t perverted. In fact, it was very nice of him.

	So what was Ranma?

	Was he like all of the other boys or was he different?

	Pondering this, Akane stared out at the koi pond and 
murmured, &quot;I just can&#39;t figure him out.&quot;

	&quot;Nihao.&quot;

	Akane looked up to see Shampoo hovering over her wearing 
a charming smile. &quot;Shampoo,&quot; greeted Akane.

	&quot;Airen off training with stupid panda father,&quot; said Shampoo as 
she sat next to Akane on the porch. &quot;And that give Shampoo perfect 
chance to talk with you, Akane.&quot;

	&quot;Why do you want to talk with me?&quot; asked Akane.

	&quot;Too simple,&quot; Shampoo said as her scarlet eyes grew lidded. 
&quot;Shampoo want to ask you stop insult Airen. He hear what you calling 
him today. What is word again? Weirdo?&quot;

	Narrowing her eyes, Akane said, &quot;He is a weirdo though. Do 
you know anyone else who changes into a girl?&quot;

	&quot;Curse not Airen&#39;s fault,&quot; Shampoo reasoned. &quot;And Ranma 
not like it either. He try for many weeks to find cure back home in 
Joketsuzoku before discovering there not one he be able to use. It 
take him long time to adjust to changing into girl and he not like but 
Shampoo tell him is all right to be both such a cute boy and girl.&quot;

	&quot;What?&quot; said Akane in clear surprise. &quot;You mean that you like 
the fact that Ranma can change into a girl?&quot;

	&quot;Of course,&quot; said Shampoo easily. &quot;Airen is too attractive as 
boy and girl. Is twice as good for Shampoo since she liking both in 
what you call the romantic sense.&quot;

	&quot;You... that&#39;s...&quot; Akane said slowly. Squinting her eyes she 
looked at Shampoo and shook her head. &quot;Okay.&quot;

	&quot;And why did you call Airen pervert?&quot; asked Shampoo. &quot;I 
look up that word and find out meaning. Ranma isn&#39;t pervert. He is too 
too shy. Shampoo no can get him to do things in boy or girl form. Is 
disappointing. He not even do things boys back home all too eager to 
do.&quot;

	&quot;What things?&quot; Akane asked suspiciously.

	&quot;Nothing much,&quot; Shampoo shrugged. &quot;Bathing together, sleep 
in same bed, and other romantic things. Airen no even show Shampoo 
his body. Once Shampoo sneak in on him when stay in hotel in Hong 
Kong but he find her hiding.&quot;

	Staring at Shampoo with wide eyes, Akane came to a silent 
and internal decision about Ranma.

	He probably wasn&#39;t a pervert.

	But Shampoo definitely wanted to make him into one.

---

	The Tendo house was being watched.

	Akane, Ranma, and Shampoo were all unaware of the 
attention on them as they sat on the porch playing some sort of board 
game because of the distance that was between them and the person 
observing them.

	This was good news for Nabiki as she finished off her first roll 
of film and tucked it into her jacket pocket.

	&quot;Perfect,&quot; said Nabiki from where she was hidden in the large 
tree that was across the street. Giving a low and self satisfied chuckle 
Nabiki said, &quot;I&#39;m going to be so rich!&quot;

	From below Nabiki, the couple that was walking along the 
street reminded themselves to stay away from the Tendo dojo and the 
people that were living there. 

---

	&quot;Today, I shall show Saotome the error of his crossdressing 
ways,&quot; said Kuno in muffled tones due to the fact that his face was 
covered in wrappings because of his all too short battle with Ranma 
yesterday. &quot;I shall rescue both Akane and Shampoo from him.&quot;

	From behind Kuno, the various boys who battled for the 
honor of dating with Akane blinked at this statement.

	&quot;Crossdresser? I thought Saotome had a curse.&quot;

	&quot;He does, the booklet that Nabiki sold us said so.&quot;

	&quot;Kuno&#39;s just too dumb to realize it.&quot;

	&quot;The booklet also said Saotome is engaged to that girl 
Shampoo and she&#39;s some sorta Chinese Amazon.&quot;

	&quot;He&#39;s engaged to her? What about Akane?!&quot;

	&quot;Saotome&#39;s engaged to Akane too.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, his dad and Akane&#39;s dad engaged them.&quot;

	The entire crowd of boys were silent for a long while before a 
boy named Katsuki Fuu said, &quot;So basically Saotome has a miniature 
harem going on with them both.&quot;

	All the boys contemplated this for a moment before the 
expected reaction emerged in one loud monstrous shout.

	&quot;CURSE YOU, SAOTOME!!&quot;

	It was safe to say that the boys were feeling envious.

---
	
	Maeda was used to seeing strange things.

	Because after all, he was a teacher at Furinkan High.

	For the past few months he had taken to watching Akane fight 
her way through the mob of boys each morning before she rushed off 
to his homeroom class.

	Secretly, Maeda enjoyed watching his student beat up the 
Neanderthal minded boys who challenged her each day. This was 
because of his beliefs on feminism and the fact that he was a big 
martial arts fan. And often Akane&#39;s fights were more interesting than 
any Kung Fu movie that he could see.

	Today Maeda was greeted to a special surprise when the fight 
turned more mammoth than usual as not only Akane but Ranma and 
Shampoo fought off the morning horde.

	The fight was much shorter but just as interesting for the 
observing teacher as he watched as the various attacking boys went 
flying into the air only to land strewn all about the front yard to 
Furinkan High.

	Observing as Kuno fell back into almost the exact same 
position as he did yesterday, Maeda shook his head before he walked 
back into his classroom.

	If he was lucky, today Kuno would save all of his lofty 
challenges until after school. 

---

	Kuno woke up to a splitting headache and Nabiki&#39;s smirking 
face staring at him in droll amusement.

	It wasn&#39;t a very pleasant way to wake up.

	&quot;Tendo Nabiki,&quot; said Kuno in muffled tones while he pushed 
himself up from the cot that he was lying on. &quot;What do you want from 
me on this occasion?&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s not what I want but what you want,&quot; Nabiki replied 
smoothly. She paused to pull out a large stack of photos and said, &quot;I 
figured since you can&#39;t have Akane and Shampoo with you in the flesh 
you&#39;d be interested in having them with you in the photogenic sense.&quot;

	&quot;What?&quot; Kuno blinked before he sifted through the pile of 
photos that were in his lap. As he looked at each one of the pictures 
his eyes grew wider and wider. He finally met Nabiki&#39;s gaze and cried 
out, &quot;I must have them!&quot;

	&quot;Ten thousand yen each,&quot; said Nabiki.

	&quot;Ten thousand each?!&quot; Kuno exclaimed. &quot;But the heavens 
themselves would weep at such a price.&quot;

	Shrugging at this, Nabiki said, &quot;Then let the heavens weep but 
it&#39;s ten thousand each or no photos.&quot;

	Nabiki made a move to take the pictures back and seeing this, 
Kuno clasped her hand and shoved a large wad of yen into it as he 
said, &quot;Your mercenary tactics have won this time, Tendo Nabiki, but 
know that I do this out of love for Akane and Shampoo.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Nabiki dismissed as she counted the yen. &quot;It 
doesn&#39;t matter to me why you buy the pictures.&quot; She then stood up 
and made her way out the nurses office but paused in the doorway. 
&quot;I&#39;d give up on trying to defeat Ranma if I were you. He&#39;s just too 
good for you to beat.&quot;

	With that, she left the nurses office to leave Kuno alone. 
Tucking the pictures safely into his pocket, Kuno then narrowed his 
eyes and said in muffled tones, &quot;Saotome thinks he&#39;s too good for me 
does he? He will learn otherwise.&quot;

	Seconds later, Kuno started writing his official challenge letter 
to the crossdressing fiend, Saotome Ranma.

	Some would say that Kuno took being dense to an almost 
artistic level of consciousness.

	It&#39;s certain that Ranma would agree with that opinion.

---

	Ranma paused in the middle of inhaling his lunch to stare at the 
envelope that was being held in front of his face.

	Ranma looked up at Nabiki, swallowed the last of his lunch 
and asked, &quot;That letter for me or something?&quot;

	&quot;Bingo,&quot; said Nabiki dryly. She then handed the envelope to 
Ranma who was gazing at the front of it which read: For the 
crossdressing fiend Saotome Ranma.

	&quot;Aw, man,&quot; Ranma groaned. &quot;This is from that Kuno jerk, isn&#39;t 
it? What&#39;s that guy&#39;s problem anyway?&quot;

	&quot;Kuno baby just hates to lose,&quot; Nabiki replied easily before 
she turned on her heel and walked away. &quot;I&#39;d be at the meeting place 
after school or he&#39;ll never stop bothering you.&quot;

	&quot;Huh,&quot; snorted Ranma as he opened the envelope and began 
to read the letter. After a moment, he noticed that both Akane and 
Shampoo were peering over his shoulder. &quot;It&#39;s just a challenge letter 
asking me to fight him after school,&quot; Ranma informed with almost dry 
humor as he looked up at them.

	Both the girls flushed slightly and Shampoo was the first to 
respond as she said, &quot;Sword boy much stupid if he is thinking he can 
beat Airen. Why he no give up?&quot;

	&quot;Because Kuno&#39;s a baka, that&#39;s why,&quot; Akane said in annoyed 
tones as she crumpled up her lunch bag. She turned to toss in the 
nearby garbage can then looked at Ranma. &quot;So are you going to fight 
him or not Ranma?&quot;

	Staring at the letter thoughtfully, Ranma finally shook his head 
and tossed it into the same garbage can that Akane had thrown her 
lunch bag into.

	&quot;I gotta,&quot; Ranma said in easy confident tones. &quot;It&#39;s part of my 
duty as the Anything Goes heir to accept and meet challenges. Even if 
they&#39;re from a jerk like Kuno. Besides, there&#39;s no way that I&#39;m gonna 
let him keep insulting me.&quot;

	After Ranma said this he formed a rather dangerous looking 
smirk and seeing it was enough to make Akane and Shampoo almost 
feel sorry for Kuno.

	Almost, but not quite.

---

	When school was over for the day a large group of students 
gathered outside of the front entrance to watch the much rumored 
second fight between Ranma and Kuno.

	And taking all of their bets was, of course, Nabiki.

	Scowling as she saw the amount of money passing through her 
sister&#39;s hands, Akane said, &quot;I can&#39;t believe her.&quot;

	&quot;Am thinking Nabiki like money, yes?&quot; Shampoo commented 
as she watched Nabiki work.

	&quot;You could say that,&quot; Akane said lowly before she turned 
towards Kuno was starting his usual challenge spiel.

	&quot;Saotome!&quot; Kuno announced as he tore off the large white 
bandage which had covered his face. &quot;Now you shall be punished for 
your... eh?&quot; Kuno paused in his speech to blink at Ranma who had 
broken out into a fit of laughter.

	Gazing at Kuno&#39;s face that was completely covered with the 
bruise marks from his battle with the Kendo Captain yesterday, 
Ranma couldn&#39;t hold back his laughter.

	Clutching his stomach, Ranma wheezed, &quot;You sure that you 
wanna fight me, Kuno? You look pretty bad off.&quot;

	Scowling at this, Kuno rushed at Ranma with his bokken and 
shouted, &quot;Fiend! No one mocks Kuno Tatewaki!&quot;

	Ducking Kuno&#39;s would-be blow, Ranma groaned and said, 
&quot;This is stupid, Kuno. Why don&#39;t we just stop this before you get 
yourself hurt even worse, huh?&quot;

	&quot;Crossdresser!&quot; Kuno yelled as he moved his bokken to slash 
it at Ranma in a dangerous attack.

	It was a move that Ranma barely avoided but in the process 
several pictures slipped out from Kuno&#39;s shirt and floated towards the 
ground. Seeing the pictures fall, Ranma swiftly grabbed them and his 
eyes widened on seeing Akane and Shampoo in every single photo.

	Contemplating this, Ranma said softly to himself, &quot;What&#39;s this 
nutball doing with these things anyway?&quot;

	&quot;You dare to ignore Kuno Tatewaki during a battle?!&quot; Kuno 
exclaimed as he moved forward to make another strong attack with 
his bokken.

	This time it was an attack that Ranma couldn&#39;t avoid and the 
bokken ended up striking him in the side.

	&quot;Airen!&quot; cried Shampoo worriedly.

	Holding his side, Ranma frowned at Kuno and tucking the 
pictures into the pocket of his pants he said, &quot;You wanna play it rough, 
Kuno? Then we&#39;re gonna play it rough.&quot;

	With that, Ranma ducked into a crouched position before his 
arms moved in a blurring speed to strike at Kuno.

	Seconds later, Kuno collapsed unconscious onto the ground 
and moving into a standing position, Ranma sighed as he said, &quot;Jerk. 
Maybe that&#39;ll teach him a lesson.&quot;

	&quot;Aiyaah,&quot; Shampoo said when she arrived at Ranma&#39;s side and 
looked at Kuno&#39;s fallen figure. &quot;Airen hit sword boy in exact same 
place as yesterday. No wonder he fall so fast.&quot;

	&quot;Ouch,&quot; Akane winced. &quot;That has to hurt.&quot; She turned to look 
at Ranma and asked, &quot;But what distracted you in the middle of the 
fight like that? Kuno almost got you there.&quot;

	&quot;Yes,&quot; said Shampoo as she leaned her head and started to lift 
up Ranma&#39;s shirt to better inspect his side. &quot;And is you feeling okay?&quot;

	&quot;Hey, quit it!&quot; Ranma exclaimed while he lightly batted 
Shampoo&#39;s hands away from his red silk shirt. &quot;I&#39;m feeling fine. That 
blow barely even hurt.&quot; He paused to retrieve the pictures from his 
pocket and said, &quot;But this is what distracted me. Kuno dropped them 
during our fight.&quot;

	Akane took the pictures from Ranma and looking at them she 
turned bright red before she crumpled them in her fist and glared at 
Kuno&#39;s unconscious form.

	&quot;Kuno,&quot; said Akane in threatening tones. &quot;If that baka wasn&#39;t 
already knocked out... I&#39;d... I&#39;d...&quot;

	&quot;Hey, no problem, Akane,&quot; said Ranma easily as he offered 
her a smile. &quot;You just wait for him to wake up and then you can do it 
to him. Good idea, huh?&quot;

	&quot;Do what?&quot; Shampoo blinked as she looked at the crumpled 
pictures Akane had dropped. &quot;Why Akane upset?&quot;

	&quot;Why am I...?&quot; Akane trailed off in disbelief before she 
stomped over to Shampoo. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you don&#39;t mind that this 
baka had pictures of us! And in some of them we&#39;re hardly even 
dressed! Doesn&#39;t that make you mad?&quot;

	&quot;Well,&quot; said Shampoo thoughtfully while she continued to 
study the pictures with careful eyes. &quot;Shampoo not like they not good 
pictures of her. Look at this one, it not even catch Shampoo&#39;s best 
profile. Is shoddy camera work.&quot;

	Snorting at this, Ranma gave the fallen Kuno a light kick in the 
side and murmured, &quot;What gets me is wondering where this jerk got 
his hands on those pictures.&quot;

	&quot;Is good point, Airen,&quot; Shampoo mused. &quot;Shampoo no liking 
idea of someone besides Airen see her in such open positions. At least 
not without Shampoo&#39;s permission.&quot;

	While Ranma and Shampoo pondered this Akane&#39;s eyes 
narrowed as she vaguely caught side of Nabiki making an all too 
subtle exit from the scene of the battle.

---

	Hearing a knock at her door, Nabiki looked up from her 
personal computer and immediately knew who it was.

	&quot;Yes, Akane?&quot;

	The door to Nabiki&#39;s room opened and Akane walked in 
wearing a small frown on her pretty features.

	&quot;Nabiki,&quot; began Akane slowly as she produced the crumpled 
pictures and slapped them onto her sister&#39;s desk. &quot;I don&#39;t want you 
taking anymore of these. I didn&#39;t tell Ranma and Shampoo that you 
took them but if you do it again next time I won&#39;t keep your 
photography hobby a secret.&quot;

	&quot;Oh?&quot; asked Nabiki smoothly. She took the pictures and 
neatly put them in a stack like you would do with a deck of playing 
cards. &quot;And why didn&#39;t you tell them now?&quot;

	&quot;Because you&#39;re my Oneechan,&quot; Akane said while she turned 
around and headed out the door. &quot;And I don&#39;t want to see Shampoo 
do to you what Ranma did to Kuno.&quot; Before she shut the door to 
Nabiki&#39;s room, Akane said, &quot;Remember what I said and don&#39;t take 
anymore pictures of us, Nabiki.&quot;

	Staring at the closed door to her room, Nabiki inspected the 
crumpled pictures and tucking them into the pocket of her pants she 
leaned back into her chair.

	&quot;Well, now,&quot; Nabiki murmured as she looked up at the ceiling 
and formed a feline smile. &quot;I&#39;ll just have to find another way to make 
some money, won&#39;t I?

	If Akane heard this statement it would&#39;ve left her anything but 
reassured about her sister&#39;s activities.

	In fact, it would&#39;ve made her more worried.
