------------------------------------------------

Akane soaked in the hot water of the furo, eyes closed as she recalled 
the lovemaking session she just completed with Kasumi and Dr. 
Tofu.  It was, as Nabiki and Ranko had told her it would be, 
extremely pleasurable and physically satisfying.  But she had to admit 
that it hadn&#39;t been as emotionally satisfying as it was with Ranma. 
 
Akane wondered if that was the way her sisters felt with Ranma. 
 
Although she and Kasumi and Dr. Tofu had brought each other to 
climax many times, it seemed that she was somehow clinically 
detached from the lovemaking.  She could at last admit to herself that 
there was nothing between Dr. Tofu and herself except as a friend or 
a member of the family. 
 
She stepped out of the furo and dried herself, wrapping a gi around 
her body for cover.  She had taken to wearing nothing but the gi on 
the way to and from the bath, and she and Ranma dressed only in 
their underwear nearly every night while they were in their room.  
The exceptions were when their parents asked to enter. 
 
After she walked up the stairs she paused for a second in front of 
Kasumi&#39;s door.  Soun had initially objected to Dr. Tofu moving in 
with Kasumi, but Kasumi reminded him that they were engaged and 
said that a trial period of living together would make for a more 
harmonious marriage.  She continued past Kasumi&#39;s door without any 
regret and opened her own. 
 
The room was dark, and Ranma lay with his back to the door.  Akane 
closed the door and let the gi slip from her body.  She slipped in 
under the covers behind him.  He refused to look at her. 
 
Akane:  &quot;Where are Nabiki and Ranko?&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;I didn&#39;t want to... you know.  They offered to stay, but I 
        wanted to be alone.&quot; 
 
Akane snuggled up to Ranma and hugged his chest from behind.  She 
wished he would look at her. 
 
Ranma:  &quot;Did you... did you enjoy it?&quot; 
Akane:  &quot;He&#39;s very good.  Kasumi&#39;s lucky to have him.  Just like we 
        have each other.&quot; 
 
They both lay in silence for a moment. 
 
Akane:  &quot;Ranma, what is it?&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;I was... I wasn&#39;t sure that you would come back.&quot; 
Akane:  &quot;What?  Why would you think that?&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;I thought, maybe Dr. Tofu would be so much better than 
        me that you&#39;d stay with him.&quot; 
Akane:  &quot;Ranma, you dummy.  Even if he was better than you, I don&#39;t 
        love him.&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;I didn&#39;t know...&quot; 
Akane:  &quot;Ranma, are you crying?&quot; 
 
Akane lifted her hand to Ranma&#39;s face and found the wetness at his 
eyes.  She knew that if she had felt at her own face she would find her 
own.  She had meant that much to him.  She crawled over him, 
turning him onto his back, and kissed the tears away. 
 
Akane remembered he had done the same for her, after he had taken 
her virginity. 
 
Akane lay next to Ranma and pulled his body onto her own, shifting 
him downward so that his face lay nestled against her breast, his 
hand resting on her waist.  Akane&#39;s hand rested on his back, the other 
finding its own spot on the back of his head. 
 
Akane:  &quot;Do you want to make love?&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;Can I just hold you?&quot; 
  
Akane nodded and stroked Ranma&#39;s hair, playing with the strands 
between her fingers.  Ranma soon fell asleep. 
 
Akane:  &quot;What if we started over, Ranma?  Just be boyfriend and 
        girlfriend and find out everything about each other?  Would 
        that convince you I&#39;d never leave?&quot; 
 
Akane hugged Ranma a little closer to herself and closed her eyes. 
 
*************** 
 
Gosunkugi sat outside the gymnasium window, taking pictures of the 
female gymnasts in their gym shorts. 
 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;Oh... so beautiful...  So sensuous...  Akane Tendo... 
        Ranko Saotome... I love you...&quot; 
 
Gosunkugi took out some photos from his collection and spread them 
on the ground.  He rubbed his crotch as he started to salivate. 
 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;So sexy...&quot; 
 
Gosunkugi orgasmed and lost consciousness, his head falling forward 
until it hit the ground.  Ranma, who had been playing soccer, noticed 
the ostrich-like shape by the gymnasium window.  He went over to 
investigate while the rest of the players followed in curiosity. 
 
Gosunkugi fell over and rolled onto his back.  Ranma was outraged at 
the photographs of Akane and Ranko, but was afraid of touching 
them (not knowing what else Gosunkugi used them for).  Ranma was 
surprised when Nabiki showed up with a flame-thrower and burnt the 
photos. 
 
Nabiki:  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Ranma, I&#39;ll handle this.&quot;  [turning to the 
        conscious and out of breath Gosunkugi on the ground and 
        pointing the flame-thrower at him]  &quot;So, it appears the 
        rumors were true.  Are there any other photographs of either 
        my sister or sister-in-law?&quot; 
 
Gosunkugi recognized his precarious position, so he emptied out his 
library of photographs onto the ground.  Nabiki quickly destroyed 
them all. 
 
Nabiki:  &quot;As their agent, if I ever find you in possession of any non-
        official photographs again, I will have to take drastic 
        measures and dry that stain... permanently.&quot; 
 
Gosunkugi gulped nervously as Nabiki sent a blast of flame darting 
close to his crotch.  The crowd that had gathered looked at the wet 
spot on his pants and murmured among themselves.  He was just glad 
he didn&#39;t soil himself. 
 
*************** 
 
Ranma and the others went back to playing soccer.  He hoped that 
what Nabiki did would solve the problem.  He didn&#39;t like to beat up 
on defenseless people, but this was Akane and Ranko that guy was 
going after. 
 
Ranma:  &quot;I never noticed him before.&quot; 
Daisuke:  &quot;Who, Voodoo Spike Gosunkugi?  He&#39;s the type no one 
        notices.&quot; 
Hiroshi:  &quot;But he is the type that&#39;ll get arrested and placed in a mental 
        institution.&quot; 
 
*************** 
 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;That fool Saotome!  He&#39;s the one to blame for all of 
        this.  Coming out of nowhere and winning my Akane&#39;s hand 
        overnight.  That fool Saotome!&quot; 
 
Gosunkugi secured the candles to his head with his bandanna, 
lighting them as he took out his voodoo doll, hammer, and trusted 
five-inch nail.  He started to pound the nail into the doll. 
 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;That fool Saotome!&quot;  [hits himself with hammer]  &quot;Feh.  
        The last indignity.&quot; 
 
Gosunkugi screamed and ran around the courtyard as his hair caught 
fire. 
 
*************** 
 
Kuno ran into the courtyard as the school day ended, chasing down 
Ranma. 
 
Kuno:  &quot;Ranma Saotome!  Prepare yourself.&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;Hi, Blue Blunder.&quot; 
 
Kuno swung his bokken at Ranma, who dodged and kicked Kuno in 
the face.  Kuno flew backwards and landed on the ground. 
  
Ranma:  &quot;Long time no see.  Is there something I can do for you?&quot; 
Kuno:  &quot;Its after the fact now, but...&quot; 
 
Kuno handed Ranma a letter of challenge as the other students 
mumbled among themselves.  Akane and Ranko walked out of the 
gym and up to Ranma, with Akane taking his hand in her own, 
causing even more comment.  Kuno jumped toward them. 
 
Kuno:  &quot;Akane Dendo!  Wanko Saodome!  Look whad I can do wid 
        my dongue!&quot; 
  
Kuno waved his tongue at the two girls, hoping to impress them with 
the oral skills he had learned from his sister.  He ran into Ranko&#39;s 
foot and was knocked back onto the ground again.  Everyone left him 
there and went home. 
 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;Every man has a weak spot.  Find it and he&#39;s finished.&quot; 
 
Kuno looked up to see someone with his head completely wrapped in 
gauze looking down at him. 
 
Kuno:  &quot;What are you?&quot; 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;Freshman Group F.  Hikaru Gosunkugi.  You wouldn&#39;t 
        know me.  No one does.  But I know Ranma Saotome.  Shall 
        I tell you his weak spot?&quot; 
Kuno:  &quot;Do you think that I&#39;ve fallen so low as to strike secretly at my 
        enemy&#39;s weak spot?&quot; 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;Ok, good-bye.&quot; 
Kuno:  &quot;What is it?&quot; 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;What?&quot; 
Kuno:  &quot;There is no dishonor in striking at a weak spot openly.  What 
        is it?&quot; 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;But I don&#39;t know what it is yet.&quot; 
Kuno:  &quot;Then find out, you idiot.&quot; 
 
Kuno hit Gosunkugi away with his bokken.  Lower life forms had to 
be properly disciplined. 
 
*************** 
 
Ranma landed on Kuno&#39;s head. 
 
Ranma:  &quot;What&#39;s up, Gosunkugi?  Why&#39;d you want to meet me here?&quot; 
Kuno:  &quot;What are you doing on my head?&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;Check it out.&quot; 
 
Ranma showed Kuno a letter from Gosunkugi asking him to stand on 
Kuno&#39;s head.  Gosunkugi threw a box of small creatures at Ranma.  
Kuno fell onto the floor. 
 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;I never did find his weak spot, so I decided to see if he 
        was afraid of horrible creatures.&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;So that&#39;s it, huh?  Looking for my weak spot?  Don&#39;t waste 
        your time.&quot; 
Kuno:  &quot;Liar!  Liar!  Even Tatewaki Kuno is afraid of these things.  
        And you claim to fear nothing?  If that&#39;s the case, if I find 
        out what it is, you will arrange for me to date with your 
        sister.&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;Get bent, upperclasshole.&quot; 
 
Ranma left the gym.  Kuno grabbed Gosunkugi and shook him so 
that Gosunkugi got whiplash. 
 
Kuno:  &quot;You must find out what Saotome&#39;s weak spot is.  Then we 
        can force him to do our bidding.&quot; 
  
Ranma&#39;s scream floated into the gymnasium.  Kuno and Gosunkugi 
ran after him, but fell into a pit and had their legs caught in bear 
traps. 
 
Kuno:  [bleeding heavily]  &quot;And why did you dig this pit right here?&quot; 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;Um... I wanted to see if Saotome was afraid of... 
        gangrene?&quot; 
Kuno:  &quot;Gangrene?!&quot; 
 
Kuno started to run, but hit the side of the pit and knocked himself 
unconscious when he fell backwards.  Gosunkugi started to wonder 
about the wisdom of using him as a tool to get rid of Ranma as he 
released and bandaged his own leg.  Kuno woke up. 
 
Kuno:  &quot;I must rescue my loves from that beast Saotome!&quot; 
 
Kuno started to climb out of the pit, bear trap still attached to his leg.  
Gosunkugi hammered another nail into the voodoo doll. 
 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;That fool Saotome!&quot; 
 
Gosunkugi looked up as the candles tied to his head ignited Kuno&#39;s 
pants.  Gosunkugi fell back into the pit as Kuno&#39;s foot stepped on his 
face. 
 
************** 
 
Caretaker:  &quot;Stupid children.  Digging pits right outside of the 
        academic buildings.&quot; 
 
The grounds caretaker started to shovel the mound of dirt back into 
the pit.  Gosunkugi woke as the dirt  filled his mouth.  He stood up. 
 
The caretaker screamed in fright and hit him on the head with his 
shovel. 
 
Caretaker:  &quot;Get back in your grave!  The dead should stay dead!&quot; 
 
The caretaker started to shovel the dirt even faster. 
 
************** 

A group of students looked up from their poker game to the sight of a 
Kuno engulfed in a ball of flame, running wildly in search of the 
pool, his left leg encased in a metal trap. 
 
Student:  &quot;Kuno?&quot; 
Student:  &quot;Kuno.&quot; 
 
They returned to their poker game. 
 
*************** 
 
Ranma walked back to the dojo with Ranko and Akane. 
 
Akane:  &quot;What was it, Ranma?&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about it.&quot; 
Akane:  [indignant]  &quot;I told you that I couldn&#39;t swim.  I thought we 
        were going to be open with each other.&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;Well...&quot; 
Ranko:  &quot;It wasn&#39;t anything.  Nope.  Nothing.&quot; 
 
Ranko covered Ranma&#39;s mouth with her hands and ran off with him 
to the dojo.  Akane watched them go and figured that whatever it was 
that affected Ranma must affect Ranko as well.  A small pig wearing 
a yellow collar wandered onto the road in front of her while dragging 
a backpack behind it. 
 
Akane:  &quot;Hi Ryoga.  Did you make it home?&quot; 
Ryoga:  &quot;Bwee!&quot; 
 
Ryoga shook his head &quot;no&quot;. 
 
Akane:  &quot;Well, you look tired, so why don&#39;t I take you back to the 
        dojo... and Ranko.&quot; 
 
Akane smiled as Ryoga blushed, which looked peculiar in his present 
form.  Ryoga followed her as they walked back to the dojo. 
 
*************** 
 
Ranko:  &quot;Are you crazy, Ranma?  I don&#39;t want them knowing about 
        that!&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;But... we did... I mean...&quot; 
Ranko:  &quot;They&#39;ll laugh at us until they choke.&quot; 
 
Genma came running by and dragged Ranma to the dojo, throwing 
him to the floor. 
 
Genma:  &quot;Today, I will start training you from the beginning.&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;What&#39;s this all about?  C&#39;mon, what?&quot; 
Genma:  &quot;I heard about it.  How you screamed and were found 
        unconscious.  I didn&#39;t raise my son to be so fragile.&quot; 
 
Genma leapt into the air and kicked at Ranma, who dodged. 
 
Ranma:  &quot;Wait a minute, that was...&quot; 
Akane:  &quot;What was it?&quot; 
 
Ranma gets kicked to the floor while distracted.  Akane entered the 
dojo, followed by Ranko holding a happy Ryoga against her breasts. 
 
Akane:  &quot;Mr. Saotome!  Does Ranma really have a weak spot?&quot; 
Genma:  &quot;Well, he is...&quot; 
 
Ranko kicks a bucket of water so that it hits Genma&#39;s head, 
transforming him into a panda. 
  
Ranko:  &quot;Would you mind keeping your nose out of our business?&quot; 
Akane:  [angry]  &quot;Don&#39;t talk to me like that!  Can&#39;t you even trust 
        me?&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;We... we can&#39;t.&quot; 
Akane:  &quot;What?&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;And there&#39;s a very good reason.  Take a look.&quot; 
 
Ranma smashed the floor of the dojo and pulled up Gosunkugi, who 
was in the middle of giving himself a tetanus shot. 
 
Ranma:  &quot;See?&quot; 
 
************** 

Ranko went to the furo to the knowing smile of her mother, who 
tacitly informed her that she knew exactly what was going on.  
Ryoga&#39;s eyes widened as he watched Ranko undress in front of him.  
He had seen her naked after their lovemaking, but this time she did a 
little striptease for him. 
 
Ranko:  &quot;Did you miss me?  I missed you.&quot; 
 
Ranko poured hot water onto Ryoga, changing him back to human 
form.  Before he could react, she started to soap his body with the 
washtowel.  Ranko ran the washtowel over his chest and legs, finally 
stopping at his erect manhood.  The rough texture of the washtowel 
scraped against the sensitive skin and Ranko took the opportunity to 
both stroke his manhood in her hand and kiss him simultaneously. 
 
Ryoga was disappointed when Ranko stopped to pour hot water over 
their bodies, rinsing both of them off.  She handed the washtowel to 
Ryoga and turned her back to him. 
 
Ranko:  &quot;Its your turn, now.&quot; 
 
Ryoga started to lather Ranko&#39;s back.  He really wanted to lay her 
onto the floor and make love to her, but bathing each other was fun, 
and he knew that they&#39;d get there eventually.  Ranko scooted over and 
pressed her body to his; she took his hands in her own and started to 
scrub her breasts.  Ranko could feel his arousal trapped between their 
bodies. 
 
Ranko reached over and got some hot water to wash the soap off.  
She turned around and started to slide down Ryoga&#39;s body, his 
aroused manhood tracing a path across her stomach and through her 
breasts.  Ryoga couldn&#39;t believe how lucky he was to be involved with 
such a woman.  His nosebleeds seemed to be a thing of the past as 
well. 
 
Ranma&#39;s scream came floating in from outside.  Ryoga jumped up 
and started to run toward the scream, wanting to find out what had 
scared Ranma so badly, possibly being able to use it against him in 
the future.  Ryoga no longer hated Ranma, but he still owed him a 
fight.  Ranko cursed to herself as Ryoga&#39;s wet body slipped from her 
grasp. 
 
Ranko:  &quot;Ryoga, you dummy!&quot; 
 
Ranko splashed Ryoga with cold water, turning him into his pig 
form.  Ryoga went bouncing off out of the house.  Ranko quickly 
dried herself off and ran after him. 
 
************** 

Gosunkugi heard Ranma&#39;s scream of terror and ran toward the source 
of the noise.  He was quickly trampled and knocked unconscious by 
the members of the Tendo household. 
 
************** 
 
Ranma lay unconscious on the ground with a cat on his chest.
 
Kasumi:  &quot;Hanachiyo!  There you are!&quot; 
Akane:  &quot;Ranma!&quot; 
 
Kasumi picked the cat off of Ranma&#39;s body.  Genma filled a bucket of 
water and threw it on Ranma. 
 
Genma:  &quot;Coward!  And you call yourself a man?&quot; 
Ranma and Ranko:  &quot;Shut up!  This is all your fault!&quot; 
Genma:  &quot;Oh, so?&quot; 
 
Genma held a cat in his hands.  Ranma and Ranko both fled behind 
other people. 
 
Nodoka:  &quot;Dearest, what do they mean that its your fault?&quot; 
 
Genma gulped. 
 
************** 
 
Everyone sat around the living room table, except for Ryoga, who in 
his pig form was being held on top of the table by Ranko. 
 
Genma:  &quot;When my children were ten years old, I decided to train 
        them in the method of the Cat-Fist.&quot; 
Nabiki:  &quot;The Cat-Fist?&quot; 
Genma:  &quot;Yes.  Take fish sausages, tie it around the trainees, and 
        throw them into a pack of hungry cats!&quot; 
Kasumi:  &quot;Goodness!&quot; 
Soun:  &quot;How vigorous.&quot; 
Genma:  &quot;This manual led me to do it.  But it contained a terrible 
        trick.&quot; 
  
Genma showed the others a combat manual.  Soun took it and opened 
it to the description of the Cat-Fist. 
 
Soun:  &quot;But... what?&quot; 
Genma:  &quot;Turn the page.&quot; 
 
Soun turned the page, only to read that the teaching technique that 
Genma used was described as &quot;a teaching technique that would be 
used only by a total idiot.&quot; 
 
Genma:  &quot;I fell for it completely.&quot; 
Ranko and Ranma:  [hitting Genma]  &quot;What a stupid father.&quot; 
Genma:  &quot;Oh?&quot; 
 
Genma pulled out a cat, and the twins retreated to a safe distance.  
Soun and Nabiki start to place cats on the twin&#39;s bodies. 
 
Nabiki:  &quot;I can&#39;t believe it.  Are you two really afraid of a couple of 
        little cats?&quot; 
Kasumi:  &quot;You&#39;re not really afraid are you?  They&#39;re so cute.&quot; 
Genma:  &quot;No!  No!  No!&quot; 
 
Genma starts to leave, but is stopped by Nodoka, who looks at her 
husband with a disapproving expression on her face. 
 
Nodoka:  &quot;And what else is there to this story, husband?&quot; 
Genma:  &quot;Um... I tried to combat the fear of cats by tying dried 
        sardines and throwing them into the pit of hungry cats, then 
        salted sardines.  I even tried fish cakes.  Each new failure 
        tore up my heart.&quot; 
Nodoka:  [very angry]  &quot;What about our children?&quot; 
Genma:  &quot;And that training produced yet another tragedy!&quot; 
Kasumi:  &quot;You mean there&#39;s more?&quot; 
Genma:  &quot;When they&#39;re fear of cats come to a peak, they yowl.&quot; 
Soun:  &quot;They yowl?&quot; 
Genma:  &quot;At that point... they are uncontrollable.&quot; 
Kasumi:  &quot;How terrifying.&quot; 
 
*************** 

Akane smiled as she placed wet towels on Ranma&#39;s and Ranko&#39;s 
forehead. 
 
Ranma and Ranko:  &quot;Get them off!  Get them off!&quot; 
Akane:  &quot;Don&#39;t let it worry you two.  Its cute to have a little weak 
        spot.&quot; 
 
*************** 
 
Kasumi:  &quot;Stay in here, Hanachiyo.  Don&#39;t frighten Ranma anymore.&quot; 
 
Kasumi put Hanachiyo into a cat carrier and left for the kitchen.  
Gosunkugi crept up and opened it to look in.  Hanachiyo reacted and 
Gosunkugi screamed.  He left the dojo with a scarred face. 
 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;Just you wait, Saotome.  I will soon lead you into feline 
        hell!&quot; 
 
*************** 
 
Nabiki entered Ranko&#39;s room as Gosunkugi&#39;s scream floated in the 
air.  Everyone thought it was Genma, so they ignored it. 
 
Nabiki:  &quot;Are they still frightened of those cats?&quot; 
Akane:  &quot;They&#39;re still a little jumpy.&quot; 
Nabiki:  &quot;Well, there is a way to calm them down...&quot; 
 
Nabiki and Akane looked knowingly at each other.  Akane suddenly 
remembered who else was in the room. 
 
Akane:  &quot;Ryoga!&quot; 
Nabiki:  &quot;Ryoga?&quot; 
 
Akane poured some hot water on Ryoga to turn him back to his naked 
human form.  He immediately tried to hide his private parts as he 
searched for the spare set of clothes he left in the room.  From below 
came Kasumi&#39;s voice telling them that dinner was ready. 
 
*************** 
 
Dr. Tofu entered the dojo.  Kasumi hugged him as he entered and 
they walked holding each other&#39;s hands. 
 
Kasumi:  &quot;How was your day?&quot; 
Dr. Tofu:  &quot;Tiring.  But I saw all the patients you scheduled for home 
        visits.&quot; 
Kasumi:  &quot;Too tired for...&quot; 
Dr. Tofu:  [nodding]  &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; 
Kasumi:  &quot;Don&#39;t be sorry.&quot;  [puts her arm around his waist and draws 
        closer as they walk]  &quot;Its not as if I need it as often as we do 
        it.&quot; 
Dr. Tofu:  &quot;You don&#39;t?&quot; 
Kasumi:  &quot;But it is nice how often you want to do it.&quot; 
 
*************** 

Nabiki:  &quot;Daddy?&quot; 
Soun:  &quot;Yes, Nabiki?&quot;  
Nabiki:  &quot;Since Kasumi&#39;s been spending most of the day at the clinic, 
        Auntie Nodoka&#39;s been doing almost all the cooking and 
        housecleaning.  I think we should consider hiring a 
        housekeeper to take care of the household duties.&quot; 
Soun:  &quot;Fine, fine.&quot; 
 
Soun continued to read the evening newspaper.  Nabiki wasn&#39;t totally 
sure if he had been paying attention, but she would be handling all 
the arrangements.  She&#39;d already placed advertisements in the paper 
for the next day.  Hopefully she could get some young, attractive 
applicants that would also be willing to participate in her lucrative 
side business. 
 
*************** 
 
Ranko and Ryoga sat across from each other.  She had once again 
snuck him into her room using his cursed form, but refused to turn 
him back.  Ranko picked Ryoga up by his bandanna and locked him 
in a makeshift cage. 
 
Ryoga:  &quot;Bwee?&quot; 
Ranko:  &quot;I&#39;m still mad at you for running out on me in the bath.&quot; 
Ryoga:  &quot;Bwee...&quot; 
 
*************** 
 
Nabiki entered Akane&#39;s room.  Ranma and Akane were already busy 
studying.  Privately, Nabiki thought that their studying technique was 
a crock; it definitely increased the time needed but it was true that 
their grades had been at the &quot;A&quot; level since they started. 
 
Akane lay naked on her side, reading her textbook.  Ranma slowly 
penetrated her from behind, his erect manhood not moving very 
much, but not needing to.  Nabiki undressed and lay down next to 
Akane, her fingers running lightly through Akane&#39;s pubic hair and 
touching the joining sexes.  She moved her head near her fingers and 
extended her tongue to lightly taste the lovers. 
 
Akane continued to read.  When she was done, she&#39;d be brought to 
orgasm and then it would be Nabiki&#39;s turn.  Or Ranma&#39;s. 
 
*************** 
 
Kasumi looked fondly down at the sleeping Dr. Tofu.  After eating 
dinner and taking a bath, he had almost instantly fallen asleep.  She 
played a little with a few stray strands of hair, then went to her closet 
to change into a nightgown. 
 
As she combed her long hair she mused about their future life 
together.  Getting married almost seemed to be an afterthought; the 
only real question was when.  Their relationship had been perfect 
since before he moved in with her.  They meshed perfectly, both in 
personality and physically. 
 
Kasumi took a last look at Dr. Tofu in the light.  His bare chest rose 
and fell softly.  It took her a minute to realize that it seemed to her 
that something was missing.  It took her another minute to realize 
that it was her.  Kasumi turned off the light and slipped next to her 
fiance.

Marital Arts 5 - Part II

Ryoga woke when he heard his name.  He blinked in his cage; the 
lights in the room were still on.  Ranko lay nude above the bedsheets, 
her hands running down her sides, her eyes closed. 
 
Ranko:  &quot;Oh... Ryoga...&quot; 
 
Ryoga watched as Ranko&#39;s hands went to her breasts, her fingers 
lightly teasing her nipples until they stood erect and prominent, 
nestled in dark circles set against whiteness.  Ranko&#39;s hands cupped, 
then massaged her breasts.  She drew a finger up the valley between 
them. 
 
Ranko:  &quot;Yes... I love your tongue running... like that...&quot; 
Ryoga:  &quot;Bwee!&quot; 
 
Ranko heard Ryoga but she had been awake since the beginning.  She 
kept on masturbating, partly to punish him for running out on her 
and partly for what she wanted to tell him; besides, she was aroused. 
 
Ranko:  &quot;Ryoga... don&#39;t tease... can&#39;t you see how wet I am?&quot; 
 
Ranko&#39;s right hand drifted down to her red pubic hair and parted her 
lips.  Ryoga could see Ranko&#39;s juices glistening on the pink flesh as 
he looked down at her supple body.  Ranko slowly slipped a finger 
into herself, arcing her back at the pleasure she felt. 
 
Ranko:  &quot;Fill me, Ryoga... Yes... like that.&quot; 
 
Ranko plunged her fingers into her sex, letting her excitement build.  
Both she and Ryoga could imagine his manhood taking the place of 
her fingers. 
 
*************** 
 
Ranma lay on his back reading his textbook.  He tried to concentrate 
on his studies; it was difficult with his cock rising into the air and 
Akane and Nabiki giving it their full attention.  The blanket that they 
lay on was already damp with their sweat and cum. 
 
The only real drawback to their studying &quot;technique&quot; was that 
sometimes during class it would seem that he felt the hands and the 
kisses running over his body.  During the last quiz he actually found 
that he had an erection.  Luckily no one noticed and he was able to 
hit his &#39;Shiatsu Impotence Spot&#39; (the counter to the &#39;Erection Spot&#39;, 
quickly developed while Ranko was using the &#39;Spot&#39; with impunity). 
 
Twenty minutes later he had finished his studying and did a quick 
mental check to make sure he remembered everything.  He then 
turned his attention to the two sisters. 
 
Ranma took Akane&#39;s hand and led her to straddle his face.  She 
eagerly lowered herself onto him, and shuddered as his tongue slid 
along her slit and reached her clit.  Nabiki straddled his cock and 
lowered herself just as eagerly, letting her pussy lips be pushed apart 
by his invading member. 
 
Akane let herself be quickly carried to orgasm, her clit erect and 
sensitive to every movement of Ranma&#39;s tongue.  Ranma&#39;s tongue left 
her clit and plunged deep into her pussy, eliciting more moans as his 
fingers replaced it.  Akane ground her hips onto Ranma&#39;s mouth to 
achieve the greatest penetration. 
 
Nabiki pulled at her nipples as she continued to grind her hips into 
Ranma&#39;s.  Every so often Ranma would thrust his hips up and drive 
his member a little deeper into her, almost making it seem that she 
was riding a bucking bronco.  She moaned as she started to fall 
forward, bumping into Akane&#39;s swaying body. 
 
Ranma stepped up his tongue assault on Akane, who gasped as the 
new attack sent her over the edge.  She fell forward as her muscles 
rebelled against her control.  Ranma continued to lick at her body, 
gently bringing Akane pleasure as she recovered.  Akane rolled off 
Ranma&#39;s face and watched Nabiki, who was also rapidly approaching 
orgasm. 
 
Ranma started to rapidly thrust into Nabiki, wanting to time their 
orgasms together.  The increased turbulence took Nabiki over the 
edge; her pussy muscles lovingly squeezed Ranma&#39;s imbedded penis 
as she continued to bounce on his engorged member. 
 
Nabiki felt Ranma&#39;s seed start to splash in her and smiled.  Ranma 
emptied himself into her thirsty pussy and Nabiki tiredly lifted herself 
off after he was done.  Nabiki and Akane cuddled against Ranma as 
they let the night air dry the sweat from their bodies.  
 
*************** 
 
Ranko:  &quot;Shampoo... what are you doing here...&quot; 
Ryoga:  &quot;Ernk?&quot; 
 
Ryoga couldn&#39;t take his eyes of the aroused Ranko.  But he was 
confused.  Shampoo? 
 
Ranko:  &quot;Oh... Shampoo... Ryoga... yes...&quot; 
 
Ryoga was confused.  Was Ranko fantasizing that she was making 
love to both him and Shampoo at the same time?  He didn&#39;t really like 
her, though he had found her attractive during their time together.  
Was Ranko a lesbian? 
 
Ranko:  &quot;Yes, Ryoga... do me doggy-style...&quot; 
 
Ranko turned over onto her knees, her ass high in the air as she 
continued to plunge her fingers deep into herself.  Her head lay on 
the bed, the saliva from her tongue making her lips glisten, and 
Ryoga could imagine her eating Shampoo&#39;s pussy as she continued to 
take him in from behind.  Ryoga felt ashamed for thinking of such a 
thing.  But the fantasy of making love to more than one woman was 
one that every young schoolboy had. 
 
Ranko:  &quot;Oh!  Ryoga!  Shampoo!  I love you!&quot; 
 
Ryoga could see Ranko&#39;s honey run down her thighs.  Ranko 
suddenly let out a low moan as her pussy clamped down on her 
fingers; her body slowly slid forward until she was lay flat on the bed.  
Ranko looked at the coating of honey on her fingers and slowly licked 
them clean, one at a time. 
 
Ranko walked to Ryoga, opening the cage and taking him out.  
Ranko sat on the floor and placed Ryoga on her lap, then poured the 
hot thermos water onto him. 
 
Ryoga looked at her, forgetting her nudity as well as his own. 
 
Ranko:  &quot;Ryoga...&quot; 
Ryoga:  &quot;Are you... I mean...&quot; 
Ranko:  &quot;I love you, Ryoga.  I love Shampoo, too.  I&#39;ve made love to 
        you both.  Is that so horrible?&quot; 
 
Ranko started to cry. 
 
Ryoga:  &quot;I have to think about... I don&#39;t know...&quot; 
 
Ryoga dressed and started to make for the door.  Ranko spun him 
around and kissed him, her tears splashing on his face. 
 
Ranko:  &quot;I&#39;ll wait for you.&quot; 
 
Ryoga left the dojo. 
 
*************** 
 
Akane and Ranko followed Ranma to the gym.  He had just received 
a letter saying that both of them had been captured and were 
imprisoned there.  Unfortunately for whomever sent it, they were 
with him in the classroom when it arrived. 
 
They entered the gym.  On the small stage sat Gosunkugi, wearing a 
girl&#39;s dress and a wig that was half-black and half-red.  The 
practicing basketball team ignored him. 
 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;Help, Ranma, Help!  Don&#39;t you recognize me?  Its me, 
        Rankakane.&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;You are seriously disturbed.&quot; 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;Ha!  Ha!  You&#39;ve fallen into my trap, Saotome!&quot; 
 
Gosunkugi pulled on a hanging rope, opening a trapdoor.  Nobody 
got caught by it. 
 
Ranma:  &quot;Now listen...&quot; 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;I prepared a brilliant back up plan just for this 
        eventuality.&quot; 
 
Gosunkugi was hit by a log tied to the ceiling and fell through the 
trapdoor.  Ranma, Ranko, and Akane jumped down after him. 
 
Ranma:  &quot;Now, what&#39;s this all about?&quot; 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;Its all over for me... here, Saotome.  I want you to have 
        this.&quot; 
 
Gosunkugi handed Ranma a fish sausage. 
 
Ranma:  &quot;Huh?&quot; 
Ranma and Ranko:  &quot;Urk?&quot; 
 
The cats woke at the smell.  They could feel the fear in the twins and 
instantly fell in love with them. 
 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;Heh.  Heh.  Heh.  Your weak spot is cats!  Go ahead.  
        Scream, Ranma.  Let it all out.  I am your master now!&quot; 
 
Ranma and Ranko started to laugh as the cats started to purr and 
climb onto them.  There was no way they&#39;d show any weakness to a 
pathetic jerk like Gosunkugi. 
 
Ranma:  &quot;You fool!  You think a mere cat will frighten me?!&quot; 
 
Akane watched as Ranma and Ranko started to laugh a little crazily.  
She knew that they couldn&#39;t hold on for much longer, so she took 
both of them by their pigtails and headed for the door. 
 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;So Saotome&#39;s weak spot isn&#39;t cats... after all that trouble 
        I went through for a whole week to get that... Akane?  Um... 
        you shouldn&#39;t...&quot; 
Akane:  &quot;Butt out, you creep!&quot; 
Gosunkugi:  &quot;Akane!  You spoke to me!&quot; 
 
Akane opened the door.  A tiger popped out. 
  
Akane retreated to the other side of the room as the tiger entered.  
Ranko and Ranma clung to each other as the cats continued to crawl 
over them.  Gosunkugi lay on the floor unconscious, his nose broken 
after he attempted to feel Akane up under the guise of retreating from 
the tiger. 
 
Ranma and Ranko yowled, shifting to a four-footed stance as they 
started to stalk the tiger, who was confused by the change in the aura 
of the creatures facing him. 
 
*************** 
 
The basketball players watched as Kuno strolled across the court and 
interrupted their game.  He started to laugh to himself as he 
contemplated the thought of having the power of fear over Ranma. 
 
The stage exploded as the cats sought to flee the fighting.  The tiger 
landed in Kuno&#39;s arms. 
 
Kuno:  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but my heart belongs to another.&quot; 
 
Ranma and Ranko came flying out onto the floor.  The tiger 
attempted to hide behind Kuno.  Ranma swung at Kuno, who 
managed to dodge. 
 
Kuno:  &quot;Ranma Saotome!  Have you gone mad?&quot; 
 
Kuno swung at Ranma, but Ranma intercepted the bokken.  The 
bokken turned into a party favor as the floor was shredded into 
ribbons. 
 
Player:  &quot;He didn&#39;t even touch it and its like excelsior paper!  What 
        kind of power does he have?&quot; 
Kuno:  &quot;My blade!  How dare you defile such a weapon?&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;Hsss....&quot; 
Kuno:  &quot;Fetch.&quot;  [throws bokken]  &quot;Feh.  The coward has turned tail 
        and run.&quot; 
 
Ranma followed the remains of the bokken as it flew out the doorway.  
Akane followed.  Ranko jumped toward Kuno. 
 
Kuno:  &quot;Oh my love!  Come to me!&quot; 
 
Kuno was left unconscious by Ranko, his clothes shredded and 
hanging like rags from his body, his erection clearly visible to 
everyone.  Above him lay the unconscious tiger. 
 
Player:  &quot;Eww!  Look!  Homosexual Bestiality!&quot; 
Player:  &quot;Don&#39;t look at him!&quot; 
 
*************** 
 
Ranko bounced after Ranma and Akane, screeching a little at the 
sight of an unconscious Genma dressed as an old woman.  Ranma 
started to rub against Akane&#39;s leg, purring as he walked around her.  
Nodoka caught up to her husband.  The twins meowed happily and 
made their way to her.  She let them come up to her, stroking their 
hair as she tried to keep them calm. 
 
Akane:  &quot;Auntie Nodoka!  How will we get them back to normal?&quot; 
Nodoka:  &quot;I don&#39;t know, Akane dear.  Maybe if we take them to Dr. 
        Tofu, he&#39;ll be able to do something for them.&quot; 
 
Ranma and Ranko started to circle each other, sniffing at each other&#39;s 
body.  The other students commented that they really seemed to think 
that they were cats.  Ranma started to mount Ranko.  Everyone 
gasped. 
 
Akane:  &quot;Ranma!&quot; 
Nodoka:  &quot;Ranko must be... fertile right now.  Akane, you have to 
        separate them.  Ranma won&#39;t hurt you.&quot; 
Akane:  &quot;Ranma!  Stop!&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;Mwrr?&quot; 
 
The girls giggled appreciatively as they saw the bulge in Ranma&#39;s 
crotch, his cock straining against the confines of his pants.  None of 
them would admit it publicly, but after talking to Akane about 
Ranma&#39;s performance in bed, they had all fantasized about him. 
 
Akane:  &quot;Ranma!  Stop!&quot; 
 
Akane couldn&#39;t pull Ranma away from Ranko.  It seemed that Ranma 
was actually going to simulate sex (since he wasn&#39;t aware enough to 
take off his pants) with Ranko right there in the courtyard no matter 
what she did. 
 
Akane:  &quot;Ranma you dummy!&quot; 
 
Akane suddenly kicked Ranma and Ranko and watched them fly 
away. 
 
Nodoka:  &quot;Akane, that doesn&#39;t solve anything if they land together.  
        Now, where did you kick them?&quot; 
 
*************** 
 
Ranma and Ranko sat outside the Furinkan High pool, topless and 
wringing their clothes.  They had suddenly found themselves in the 
pool. 
 
Ranma:  &quot;What happened?&quot; 
Ranko:  &quot;I remember being surrounded by cats...&quot; 
 
Akane ran into the pool area followed by everyone else.  She was 
relieved that the twins seemed to have returned to normal.  The other 
students looked at the topless Ranma, his cursed form causing a 
collective hyperventilation among the males.  Akane quickly got the 
two to put their shirts back on and took the wet bra from Ranko 
before anyone noticed. 
 
The students cleared a wide path as they made their way home.  The 
only thing that they noticed was that Ranko wasn&#39;t wearing a bra and 
the outline of Ranma&#39;s crotch in the wet clothes.  Ranko and Ranma 
sighed in relief.  Their secret was still safe. 
 
*************** 
 
Gosunkugi grimaced as the school nurse set his nose.  But Akane had 
touched him, even if it was just with her elbow.  She broke his nose, 
but wasn&#39;t that a sign of true affection?  He knew Kuno would agree. 
 
He looked as she bent over him, the opening at the top of her nurse&#39;s 
uniform allowing him a view of her generous cleavage.  He stuttered 
an answer to her questions, but his manhood remained unaroused.  
She left to do some paperwork.  Gosunkugi looked over at one of the 
magazines and saw the cover showing a girl in a dress showing less 
than what he had just seen. 
 
He orgasmed in his pants and fainted again. 
 
**************** 
 
Kuno lay unconscious in the gymnasium, the tiger still lying on top 
of his body.  No one had separated them, assuming that Kuno wanted 
to remain that way and not wanting to touch him in any event, his 
predilection for perversion being well known. 
 
*************** 
 
Ranma:  &quot;Are you really hiring a housekeeper?&quot; 
Nabiki:  &quot;With Dr. Tofu and Kasumi working until late at the clinic I 
        don&#39;t see why not.  We have enough money.&quot; 
Ranko:  &quot;We do?&quot; 
Nabiki:  &quot;I just ran off another printing of that magazine and it sold 
        out again.  We&#39;ve got an emergency household fund of one 
        million yen and private accounts of about fifty thousand yen 
        each.  Ranko and Kasumi&#39;s accounts are twice as large 
        because they were the models.  Here are the bankbooks.&quot; 
 
Nabiki placed the bankbooks on the table.  Ranko looked at hers and 
smiled at the thought of having money to spare instead of being broke 
while living on the road. 
 
Ranko:  &quot;And how large is your personal account?&quot; 
Nabiki:  &quot;That is a secret.&quot;  [laughing] 
Akane:  &quot;Are there really that many perverts at Furinkan High?&quot; 
Nabiki:  [laughing]  &quot;Of course.  When are you two going to pose for 
        me?&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;I just can&#39;t believe people actually get off on those.&quot; 
Nabiki:  &quot;That&#39;s because you&#39;ve had the real thing, Ranma.&quot; 
 
Nabiki stretched lazily, letting her leg graze against Ranma under the 
table cover.  Kasumi giggled and snuggled against Dr. Tofu as they 
watched television. 
 
Kasumi:  &quot;We certainly belong to a special family.&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;So when are you going to find your own boyfriend, 
        Nabiki?&quot; 
Nabiki:  &quot;Getting tired of me already, Ranma?&quot; 
 
Nabiki laughed, showing that she wasn&#39;t offended by his question.  
Under the table, her foot made its way to playfully caress the crotch 
of his pants.  Ranma returned the favor. 
 
Nabiki:  &quot;Or just exhausted?  I figure I won&#39;t have to wait long.&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;What do you mean?&quot; 
Nabiki:  &quot;A good catch is bound to come along sometime.  Think 
        about it.  Before you came nothing ever happened around 
        here.  Well, except for Kuno, but he doesn&#39;t count.  Already 
        we&#39;ve had the two of you get together, Kasumi and Dr. Tofu 
        get together, and Ryoga, Shampoo, Kodachi, and the Golden 
        Pair.&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;Well, what about Kuno?&quot; 
Nabiki:  &quot;Are you serious, Ranma?  I have a reputation to think of.  I 
        can&#39;t waste it on a sadomasochistic homosexual bestialitist.&quot; 
Akane:  &quot;A what?&quot; 
Nabiki:  &quot;That&#39;s what the latest rumors are.  At least after what 
        happened today at school.  And that guy who was taking 
        pictures is a transvestite pornographic peeping tom.&quot; 
 
Akane noticed Ranko looking down at her tea. 
 
Akane:  &quot;Are you OK, Ranko?&quot; 
Ranko:  &quot;Yeah... I&#39;m OK, Akane.  Its just Ryoga... and Shampoo.&quot; 
Akane:  &quot;I understand.&quot;  [taking Ranko&#39;s hand]  &quot;They&#39;ll come back.&quot; 
Ranko:  &quot;Its already been a week.&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;That&#39;s normal for Ryoga.&quot; 
 
Ranko suppressed the urge to hit Ranma.  He was right. 
 
Ranma:  &quot;You haven&#39;t told them about... us.  Are you?&quot; 
Ranko:  &quot;I want to... someday.&quot; 
Ranma:  &quot;Don&#39;t... don&#39;t worry about me.&quot; 
 
Ranko and Akane looked at Ranma.  They both knew that he was 
basically giving his permission for Ryoga and Shampoo to make love 
to Akane once they knew about the Marital Arts School; whether or 
not they actually did was up to Akane, but Ranma wouldn&#39;t try to stop 
them if she wanted to. 
 
Ranko knew that Ryoga and Ranma still had their problems.  She 
hugged Ranma. 
 
Akane:  &quot;Don&#39;t worry about me, either.&quot; 
 
Akane took Ranma&#39;s hand and lost herself in his eyes. 
 
Akane:  &quot;When did you change so much?&quot; 
 
Akane leaned over to kiss Ranma.  Ranko and Nabiki looked at each 
other with mischievous eyes and crawled under the table cover.  
Akane joined them a minute later as they started to kiss at Ranma&#39;s 
cock. 
 
The three of them hit their heads as Nodoka announced the return of 
herself and the fathers.  They just barely managed to resume the more 
innocent pose they affected in public as their parents entered the 
living room. 
 
*************** 
 
Nabiki looked at the housekeeper applicant.  After a small test, she 
seemed competent enough to handle the cooking and housekeeping 
duties.  She was discreet and beautiful, which was perfect in the event 
that she could be persuaded to model for her next pornographic 
magazine.  The only problem was that she was young.  Only sixteen. 
 
Nabiki:  &quot;Are you sure that you can handle both the duties of the 
        position and your schoolwork, Miss...&quot; [checking the resume 
        to make sure she got the name right]  &quot;Kuonji?&quot; 
Ukyo:  &quot;I&#39;m sure.  And please, call me Kyoko.&quot; 
Nabiki:  &quot;Well, right now you appear to be the top applicant, though I 
        have some others to interview.  I should be able to let you 
        know within two days.&quot; 
 
The two smiled at each other as they both stood up.  Nabiki 
accompanied Ukyo to the door.  Nabiki recalled the events of the past 
two weeks and the secrecy of the family&#39;s Marital Arts school. 
 
Nabiki:  &quot;In the event that you are hired, I may ask you to sign a 
        confidentiality agreement.  Due to the events that sometimes 
        happen around the dojo.  Does this bother you, Kyoko?&quot; 
Ukyo:  &quot;Oh, not at all.  I practice martial arts myself, so I know how 
        things are sometimes.  I have no problems with that.&quot; 
Nabiki:  &quot;Very well.  I will talk to you soon.  Thank you for 
        applying.&quot; 
Ukyo:  &quot;Thank you.&quot; 
  
Ukyo walked to the small apartment she had been renting for the past 
few days in her mission to redeem the wrong done to her.  Getting the 
job at the dojo would make things easier.  She had chosen the alias 
&#39;Kyoko&#39; because of the similarity to her own name; so she wouldn&#39;t 
get caught forgetting to respond. 
 
She would entice Ranma away from his wife and make him her slave 
with her skills in the Kuonji Style of Marital Arts.  She would then 
dump him, make Ranma suffer the way she suffered after his mother 
brought her back to her family, ridiculed by everyone who had heard 
of what had happened. 
 
In truth, she was afraid.  Afraid that she would once more fall in love 
with him.  What would she do then?
