<a href="../ranma/girlfriendnow-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Nabiki&#39;s Side

Nabiki Tendo sighed to herself softly as she went over
the family balance sheet once again. Despite the
reddish black haired woman&#39;s best efforts the figures
still came out the same as she sat back tiredly in her
room. &#39;Revenues are generally down,&#39; she thought
glumly.

Since her mother&#39;s death she along with her sister
Kasumi had taken up those motherly duties, with Kasumi
maintaining the house while Nabiki ran the finances.
While their father Soun might bitch and moan at times
Nabiki had managed to keep the house afloat, even with
few students or income coming in.

&#39;Of course, things are a little tougher for me now,&#39;
Nabiki mused. Since her elder sister had become
involved with Ranma Nabiki had been obligated to cease
selling erotic photos of Ranma, one of her most
fruitful sources of income. Of course she still had
her money lending to fall back on, not to mention a
bit of blackmail and other activities, but it was
clear she was not making as much as she was.

A loud crash jerked her from her work and with a growl
of frustration Nabiki headed downstairs to see what
was going on. Humming cheerfully Kasumi was wiping
down the table as Nabiki neared, the taller woman
clearly reading the place for dinner. &quot;What&#39;s going on
now?&quot; she demanded of Kasumi.

&quot;It looks like Ryouga-san has found his way here
again,&quot; Kasumi explained mildly, &quot;I think Ranma is
dealing with it.&quot;

Taking a short detour into the kitchen Nabiki headed
outside, watching a moment as Ranma and Ryouga fought.
The boy dressed in yellow was good, Nabiki had to
concede, Ryouga fighting with a raw power that few
could match. But the red clad Ranma was better, moving
with greater speed and agility, dodging blows while
dealing powerful strikes.

&quot;I can do this all day,&quot; Ranma boasted, bouncing
lightly from foot to foot.

&quot;You aloud Akane to be despoiled by the treacherous
Ukyo,&quot; Ryouga pointed, his black hair falling into his
eyes, &quot;and for that...&quot;

Ryouga never had a chance to finish his sentence as
Nabiki took the pitcher of water she grabbed from the
kitchen and poured it over his head. In a poof of
displaced air Ryouga shifted to his pig form, and
Nabiki quickly reached down to grab him by the scruff
of his neck.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Ranma protested, &quot;why&#39;d ya do that for?&quot;

Nabiki gave him a look, &quot;You two would keep fighting
forever without a winner, you&#39;re too damn evenly
matched.&quot; She frown, &quot;And I am not putting up with the
kind of collateral damage you two tend to do!&quot;

&quot;Squuee!&quot; Ryouga tried to claim he was better.

Holding Ryouga up to her eyes she gave the pig a
dangerous glare as Nabiki said, &quot;Ryouga, I don&#39;t care
if you ambush Ranma elsewhere, but you will cease
doing it at our home.&quot; Before the pig could protest
she continued, &quot;If you persist, I will turn you into a
pig and make bacon out of you.&quot;

&quot;Squee?&quot; Ryouga said weakly.

&quot;I am not a martial artist and I feel no hesitation to
fight dirty,&quot; Nabiki continued firmly, &quot;is that
clear?&quot;

Ryouga nodded weakly, the pig looking mildly stunned.

Nabiki dropped him, &quot;Now get OUT of here!&quot; The kick
she delivered sent Ryouga flying off until he
disappeared into the distance.

&quot;Been saving that up for awhile?&quot; Ranma guessed as
they headed inside.

&quot;As a matter of fact, yes,&quot; Nabiki responded, smiling
slightly.

&quot;Welcome back,&quot; Kasumi smiled warmly at Ranma as she
stopped for a moment to kiss the young man
lingeringly.

&#39;Heh,&#39; Nabiki smiled slightly as she walked past,
heading into the kitchen a moment to give them some
privacy. She had a reputation as a hard person, one
she had intentionally developed for hers and the
others safety, but even she could feel happy to see
her sisters in love. She heard a sound and looked up,
nodding as her father came in

&quot;Daughter,&quot; her father Soun nodded, his hand out as
usual this time of week. Coolly she handed him his
weekly allowance and he nodded, tucking it away before
anyone could see. They maintained the illusion that he
was the man of the house to keep his dignity, but the
truth was that Nabiki handled all money matters.

&quot;You and Genma need to be taking in students,&quot; Nabiki
reminded him, &quot;with RAnma and Akane&#39;s reputation, we
could be pulling in students.&quot;

&quot;Not everyone is suited to our style,&quot; Soun noted,
&quot;but we will try,&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Nabiki nodded as a slightly mussed
looking Kasumi hurried in to finish work on their
dinner.

After dinner Nabiki headed out, noting how happy her
other sister Akane had been at dinner. After Ranma had
chosen Kasumi over her Akane had been quite upset,
even joining a unofficial Ranma Revenge Squad, but
over the past few weeks had become increasingly
mellow.

&#39;I wonder if those stories about her and Ukyo are
true?&#39; Nabiki mused. Deciding not to worry about it
Nabiki continued on in her expedition to Chinatown,
nodding to familiar faces as she headed for Shampoo&#39;s
restaurant. Ducking beneath the curtain she entered
the caf&#130;, heading up to the front as she passed mostly
empty tables.

&quot;What you want?&quot; Shampoo asked, the light purple
haired amazon&#39;s head resting on her arms as she moped.

Of all the potential suitors to Ranma&#39;s hand Shampoo
had taken his betrothal to Kasumi the hardest.
Instantly declaring her intention to kill Kasumi her
many attempts were blocked by Ranma, then Ranma had
shockingly told Shampoo that if she DID succeed, Ranma
would only hate her forever. Since then she had been
moping about, doing her work at the caf&#130; and otherwise
staying out of trouble.

&quot;Actually, I have a business proposal,&quot; Nabiki
answered crisply as she watched the old crone Cologne
emerge from the back.

&quot;What sort of proposal?&quot; Cologne asked suspiciously,
her long white hair tied back as she studied Nabiki.

&quot;I know you&#39;re in exile from the Amazons,&quot; Nabiki said
in a businesslike way, &quot;I assume due to your failure
with Ranma?&quot;

&quot;Is no failure!&quot; Shampoo protested hotly, &quot;It&#39;s... a
setback.&quot;

&quot;Either way,&quot; Nabiki said smoothly, &quot;you need to stay
here... and having a successful business will make it
easier.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Cologne asked.

&quot;For a reasonable cut,&quot; Nabiki gave a shark like
smile, &quot;I can boost your business at least by half.&quot;

Cologne leaned forward, her eyes sparkling as she
asked, &quot;What kind of cut?&quot; With that they proceded to
negotiate, Nabiki drawing on natural skill while
Cologne drew on her many decades of experience.

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

&quot;Well,&quot; Cologne admitted as she looked out at the
packed caf&#130; less than three weeks later, &quot;I have to
admit you did it.&quot;

Shampoo rushed by, a tiny bikini barely holding back
her assets as she served another table full of young
men. &quot;It just takes knowing your target audience,&quot;
Nabiki said with a impish little smile.

The bikini was no problem for the uninhibited Shampoo,
and putting the word out was easy for Nabiki&#39;s network
of agents. All it took was a few satisfied customers
and the word spread like wildfire through the local
schools, to the point where they were now forced to
turn customers away!

The six o&#39;clock bell rang and there was a moan of
disappointment as Shampoo&#39;s shift ended and a local,
less busty girl took over. Shampoo stalked from the
back in her usual Chinese dress, looking beautifully
dangerous as she joined them.

&quot;Here&#39;s your cut,&quot; Cologne passed over a fat envelope,
&quot;and thank you, Nabiki.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Nabiki tucked the envelope away then
excused herself. As Nabiki left she became aware that
Shampoo was following her and gave the girl a
questioning glance.

&quot;Grandmother&#39;s idea,&quot; Shampoo said as they walked
along together, &quot;is bad if you&#39;re robbed on way home.&quot;

Nabiki looked amused as she answered, &quot;I was trained
in the Tendo school of anything goes martial arts, you
know.&quot;

&quot;Shampoo never see you fight,&quot; she looked skeptical.

&quot;I never said I was very good at it,&quot; Nabiki conceded
wryly, &quot;but most people know not to try anything.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Shampoo blinked.

Nabiki winked at her, &quot;Trust me, they know they&#39;ll
regret it.&quot;

Shampoo nodded doubtfully, &quot;I suppose so.&quot; They walked
on for a while them Shampoo quietly asked, &quot;How is
Aerin... I mean, Ranma?&quot;

Nabiki thought about charging her for the information,
then decided it might impact their business
relationship. &quot;He seems very happy,&quot; she answered,
knowing that Shampoo probably wouldn&#39;t want any
punches pulled.

&quot;Ah,&quot; Shampoo nodded as they walked along. They
traveled a bit then she began to smile, &quot;And what is
this I hear about Akane being happy too?&quot;

&quot;What did you hear?&quot; Nabiki asked.

&quot;Pay first,&quot; Shampoo held out a hand.

With a chuckle Nabiki drew out a few yen, &quot;Here. If
it&#39;s worth it, I&#39;ll add more.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Shampoo leaned over, &quot;it seems that she and
Ukyo are...&quot;

&#39;Damn, that&#39;s two out of three Tendo sisters,&#39; Nabiki
blinked as she tried not to let her gaze rest on
Shampoo&#39;s breasts, &#39;maybe gayness is genetic.&#39;

End.

Notes: Based on the anime, more than manga version of
Nabiki. She&#39;s still miserly and money focused, but
she&#39;s a bit nicer than the nearly heartless manga
version.
