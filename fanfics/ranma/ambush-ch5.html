<h1>Ambush 1/2 (part 5 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/koalakiller.html">KoalaKiller</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/ambush-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>(Bewarned, things start to really get out of control from here, folks, 
so hang on!)
 
 
 
The hot rays of the mid-morning sun shone down upon the golden sand, 
with both young and old soaking up the UV rays...
 
&quot;You know Ranma, if you keep on frowning like that I would have to start 
thinking you miss my little sister.&quot; 
 
Ranma only gave the middle-Tendou sister a sharp look before laying out 
her towel on the sandy ground, &quot;Whatever.&quot;
 
Kasumi, in a deep blue one-piece swimsuit, smiled at Ranma-chan in a 
understanding way, &quot;Don&#39;t worry Ranma, you&#39;ll have fun today and you 
never know, one of your girlfriends might drop by like they always do.&quot;
 
&quot;Eh.&quot; Ranma-chan winced at that thought, while Nabiki raised an eyebrow 
on hearing her older sister using the term &#39;girlfriends&#39;.
 
&quot;Now Son,&quot; Mister Tendou added his voice into the conversation, &quot;No need 
to despair that my little girl isn&#39;t here to spent time with you.  But 
don&#39;t worry I will make sure she does next time!&quot; He slaps the 
red-haired girl on the back, &quot;Isn&#39;t that right, Saotome?&quot;
 
&quot;Indeed, my friend, next time they can go on a date or something.&quot; 
Nodded the foolish Saotome elder.
 
Ranma-chan just shook her head in frustration, wishing she could claim 
not to know the two men.
 
&quot;Cheer up, Ranma-kun, why don&#39;t you jump in and have a swim,&quot; the smirk 
on Nabiki&#39;s face could have even scared Kodachi at that moment, &quot;The 
boys around here will just love seeing you in your prime.&quot;
 
&quot;Hey!&quot; Ranma turned her head towards the older girl, then felt her face 
start to heat up as she saw the Moneylender stretch out on her own 
towel, wearing a very skimpy two-piece that would draw any hot-blood 
male.
 
&quot;Yes?&quot; Nabiki inquired, noticing the flushing face of the other girl, 
making her curious to know what Ranma-chan was thinking to have her face 
that red.
 
&quot;Um, never mind, I&#39;m going for a walk.&quot; Standing up, wearing one of her 
red shirts and a pair of black shorts, shuffled off while the others 
looked on with a mix of different expressions on their faces.
 
&quot;Interesting.&quot; Murmured Nabiki, closing her eyes while putting on her 
sunglasses.
 
&quot;Well, I think I&#39;ll go have a dip in the water.&quot; Announced Kasumi, 
standing up.
 
Smiling at his beloved daughter, Soun nodded, &quot;Have fun, Kasumi, and 
make sure to be careful since you never know what could happen in the 
water.&quot;
 
&quot;I will Father.&quot; And with one more smile, walked off towards the waves 
while missing the many stares the young men nearby was giving her.
 
Watching her sister enter into the waves with one eye open, Nabiki 
wondered when her big sister would ever find a man that would please her 
without turning into a raving madman.
 
Oh well, she thought, there are other things that need attention and 
that being one upset and confused sex-changer.  Know doubt things were 
starting to get complex between the cursed boy and a few of his 
fianc&eacute;es.  Someone&#39;s ego can be a delicate thing and seeing the main 
flame of your life with another girl who&#39;s passions could melt you heart 
wouldn&#39;t be good one little bit.
 
So it seemed that Nabiki had feared would happen and that she would have 
to get more involved then she wanted to right now.
 
Sighing at that thought, the young woman continued to lay in the sun as 
a storm of thoughts, ideas, plans and wishes ran through her head...
 
* * * *
 
Not too far from where the Tendou/Saotome clans were...
 
&quot;I really don&#39;t think this hair-brain scheme of yours will work, 
Shampoo.&quot; A male voice could be heard grumbling.
 
&quot;No be silly,&quot; A familiar purple-haired girl replied back, a smile 
playing across her lips, &quot;this work just fine if you no give yourself 
away, need to act part.&quot;
 
In a public changing room that was stationed near a popular beach.  
Inside the men&#39;s section two voices could be easily heard from one of 
the dozen or so small changing rooms.  Though, it seemed that the pair 
was currently having a disagreement.
 
&quot;And why are we in here? There isn&#39;t enough room for two people.&quot; The 
boy complained, then added, &quot;or are you being a pervert again?&quot; A smile 
tugged on his lips as he looked down at the seated girl.
 
&quot;Shampoo in here to see up-close what cute boy look like, you no being 
shy again?&quot; Answered the girl, giving the handsome boy a good look over 
as he fiddled with his swimming trunks.
 
&quot;And this one not only pervert in here too.&quot; The exotic beauty added, 
purring the words out.
 
&quot;Whatever.&quot;
 
&quot;Anyways, I think I&#39;m ready to go.&quot; He grunted out, finally getting the 
shorts to feel right without falling over onto the girl before him.
 
&quot;Akane make too, too much complaining, should thank Shampoo for thinking 
up idea for day at beach.&quot;
 
&quot;I still think we could&#39;ve used the instant water another time.&quot; The 
boy, well part-time for now, said, &quot;and why didn&#39;t you let me change 
into these things first before dumping the water on me?&quot; Akane stared at 
the Amazon.
 
&quot;What the fun in that.&quot; Was the returned response, and Akane had to 
shiver at the look in the girl&#39;s face as she smiled at him while licking 
her lips.
 
It was a lovely sunny day, and with it being a weekend the Tendou family 
had decided to make a trip to the local beach.  Of course this meant 
that Akane once again would have to go while staying out of the water.  
And for Ranma, he or rather she would have to use non-gender clothes 
just in case.
 
But once Akane had told Shampoo of the family&#39;s plans, the Amazon seemed 
to gain an idea on how she could come along while not having to worry 
about showing her desires for the youngest Tendou, though of course 
Shampoo wouldn&#39;t have minded expressing her affections for Ranma too.
 
Of course Akane had rejected the idea at first, not even wanting to 
think about using the magic water to change into a male.  But it seemed 
that the Amazon girl had other ideas and shoot out reasons why they 
should try this, one reason being to try and sniff out Ranma and see how 
he reacted to Shampoo flirting with another boy.
 
So after much asking, pleading and offers of doing some rather 
interesting things later on that evening, Akane had finally gave in and 
agreed to use the water.
 
Part of the plan had been to get Akane to convince the other family 
members that she didn&#39;t want to go, reasoning that she couldn&#39;t swim 
right so what would be the point.
 
But it had taken more effort for Akane to get out of the day&#39;s 
activities, including using the excuse on having plans to meet friends 
later on.  And it wasn&#39;t til she promised to try and come by later on 
did she finally got her Father and her oldest sister to agree.
 
Ranma, of course, gave her an odd look while Nabiki just shrugged while 
saying Akane was a big girl who could do what she wanted.  Nabiki 
herself had been looking forward to the visit to the beach, showing off 
her new outfit that would make any hot blooded male, and probably some 
females as well, stare for an extended amount of time at her.
 
So now here they were, in a small male public changing room, Shampoo now 
starting to stand up in front of a male Akane as he tried to get use to 
only using shorts in a public place.
 
Before Akane-kun could reply to that sly comment, the shapely body of 
Shampoo&#39;s moved forward and pressed hard against Akane&#39;s flat and 
muscled chest.  The feel of soft lips pressing against his own made him 
shiver in pleasure as he wrapped his arms around the girl to pull her 
closer.
 
This scene continued on for a few moments as the two exchanged a 
passionate kiss.  It was though with great reluctance that Akane-kun 
pulled back as he knew they needed to get going before this scene turned 
into something a bit more hot and steamy.
 
Shampoo sighed heavily.
 
&quot;I think we better get going,&quot; Akane-kun finally said, the stiffness in 
his shorts was a big distraction currently though having a beauty like 
this ready to do a man&#39;s greatest wish was even a bigger one.  So 
pushing open the door to check for any other boys that might have came 
in,
 
&quot;Though I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you wanted to get familiar with my 
other side right now...&quot; He had to smile at that comment.
 
Shampoo gave a thoughtful hum, making Akane sweat a bit before she said, 
&quot;Not today, try another time to do nice things to Akane boy.&quot; The Amazon 
leer promised much and it make the Tendou heir&#39;s blood rush quicker to 
current parts of her new body.
 
&quot;Right then, off we go.&quot;
 
Luckily, the pair got out without anyone seeing them, though a little 
old lady nearby did give them an odd smile.
 
* * * *
 
The water lapping at her toes, Ranma-chan watched the people in the surf 
with a distracted gaze.  The red-haired girl had been for the past 20 
minutes wondering around, thinking about her current problems and 
wishing on how she could fix them.
 
Of course, Ranma-chan had to also &#39;discourage&#39; a few curious boys who 
wanted to know her name, number and a few other questionable things that 
made the buxom girl pissed off and vented her anger out on the poor 
fools.
 
So leaving a trail of half-buried boys in the sand, Ranma-chan now stood 
looking at the blue horizon and thought on how her life sucked.
 
Thankfully though, Kasumi seemed to have a sixth sense in feeling 
someone who was down in the dumps.  As the older girl approached Ranma, 
she gave the Martial Artist her trademark smile as she stopped beside 
Ranma-chan.
 
&quot;So how are you, Ranma?&quot; Asked the Tendou housekeeper, &quot;Don&#39;t you think 
it&#39;s a wonderful day to be at the beach.&quot;
 
Gazing up at the other girl, Ranma-chan had to smile herself feeling the 
warm glow that seemed to resinate naturally from Kasumi.
 
&quot;Its fine I guess,&quot; She shrugged, dragging her toes around in the wet 
sand, &quot;though I wish I could&#39;ve take a swim as a guy though.&quot; I hate 
wearing girl swimmers the red-head thought silently.  
 
&quot;You will one day, Ranma,&quot; Kasumi started to turn her attention towards 
where her family was, &quot;but why don&#39;t you have a swim, its nice and cool 
out there...&quot; The older girl trailed off suddenly.
 
&quot;Mmmmm?&quot; Ranma turned around to see what had caught the other girl&#39;s 
attention and nearly falling over in surprise when she saw who was 
currently talking to the others.
 
&quot;Oh my,&quot; Kasumi put her fingers up to her mouth, feeling her face 
starting to heat up, &quot;who is that with Shampoo-san?&quot;
 
&quot;Huh?&quot; was the red-head&#39;s reply, wondering if she was seeing things 
right as she watched the purple-haired girl standing besides a 
medium-build, averaged in height boy who was currently linking arms with 
her suppose fianc&eacute;e.
 
&quot;I wonder who that young man is...&quot; Kasumi wondered, as she started to 
walk back, with Ranma-chan not far behind.
 
The red-head didn&#39;t respond in words but there was the slight narrow of 
the eyes.
 
Some moments ago...
 
&quot;Nihao!&quot; A cheery voice came from out of the blue.
 
&quot;Mmmmm.&quot; Nabiki opened one eye, turning her head slightly to see two 
figures now standing before her, one that was all-too familiar to the 
moneylender.
 
&quot;Shampoo-san?&quot; Soun turned in surprise, as did Genma who so far had kept 
dry, &quot;Who..?&quot;
 
&quot;Um, hello?&quot; The young man said nervously, eyeing the three like they 
were landmines ready to go off if not moved around them properly.
 
&quot;Well, well.&quot; Nabiki drawled out, now propping her head up with her 
elbow as support while gazing up at the new arrivals with a razor sharp 
interest, &quot;I see you have been sniffing around for new prey, Shampoo, I 
thought your current one was good enough for you?&quot;
 
&quot;Now Nabiki, be friendly.&quot; Soun interrupted, his attention fully on the 
pair, &quot;Who is your new friend?&quot;
 
&quot;He name is...&quot; a slight pause came over her, which Nabiki rolled her 
eyes as she started to think up obvious reasons the Amazon had brought a 
handsome boy with her to the beach, &quot;...Akira.&quot; Shampoo nodded, more to 
herself then really anyone else.
 
&quot;Ahh... its nice to meet you, young man.&quot; Soun nodded his head, while 
Genma looked on with an unusual thoughtful look.
 
&quot;Thank you, um, sir.&quot; He returned, glancing briefly at his &#39;lady friend&#39; 
before feeling a stare burning a hole through him, &#39;...yes, err, miss?&quot; 
He licked his lips, looking down at Nabiki.
 
&quot;The name&#39;s Nabiki,&quot; The middle Tendou daughter eyes had narrowed as she 
seemed to be trying to put together a puzzle that had a few pieces that 
looked to have been munched on by a few toddles, &quot;and to be honest, I&#39;m 
surprised you still have both arms right now seeing how FRIENDLY you are 
being with this beautiful, all-round cute and overly brutal lady.&quot; 
Nabiki&#39;s smile showed teeth as the boy drew back slightly from the woman 
on the towel.
 
&quot;Shampoo saw him first, sneaky-girl.&quot; Smiled back Shampoo, briefly 
tightening her grip on the boy&#39;s arm, &quot;and since Ranma no speaking to 
Shampoo, can have fun today with very lucky boy.&quot;
 
&quot;Whatever.&quot; Chuckled the older girl, as the two men looked on in wonder 
as the scene played out before them.
 
&quot;I&#39;m back.&quot; Interrupted a heavenly voice that made everyone direct their 
attention.  The sight of Kasumi seem to briefly calm the nervous boy but 
as Ranma-chan stepped into view, he seem to stare at the red-head with a 
very odd expression on his handsome features.
 
&quot;Its nice to see you again, Shampoo-san.&quot; Continued Kasumi, as she 
greeted the Amazon with her normal good-nature smile, &quot;and is this nice 
looking boy with you?&quot;
 
Though Soun had missed the tone of the question, Nabiki had to raise an 
eyebrow at the way Kasumi was now looking at the young man that Shampoo 
had seemly picked up from out of no-where.
 
&quot;I&#39;m...Akira.&quot; He seemed to pause slightly before saying his name, but 
seemed to act normal when he spoke to the Head Lady of Clan Tendou.
 
Ranma-chan meanwhile, looked on with a expression that be described 
between confusion, hurt and a touch of sadness as she viewed the way 
Shampoo was nearly clinging onto the boy&#39;s arm.
 
&quot;And the, um, girl there is my daughter.&quot; Genma added, briefly fumbling 
over his words as he introduced his ungrateful cursed son.
 
&quot;Hello.&quot; Ranma mumbled out, as Akira nodded in return as he tried not to 
look at the short but stunning red-haired girl.
 
A brief period of silence roamed over the small group soon after, as 
Shampoo removed a towel from her backpack.
 
&quot;Come,&quot; Shampoo finally broke the building tension, &quot;let us sit down 
over there, you can put lots of special Amazon sun protection cream on 
Shampoo body.&quot; The girl seem to purr the words out as she moved some 
meters away from the group.
 
&quot;Um, right.&quot; He nodded, glad to have his mind distracted with something 
else.
 
Looking on, Nabiki had to smirk at this scene playing out before her.  
No doubt Shampoo had pulled some poor boy off the street to use in one 
of her latest schemes to get Ranma jealous.  Though, with the current 
situation that had been building, it was hard to predict Saotome&#39;s 
reactions.
 
&quot;So,&quot; She said, directing her question towards the buxom red-head, &quot;you 
thoughts on Shampoo&#39;s new &#39;friend&#39;?&quot;
 
Sitting down on her towel, she cross her arms with a frown on her lovely 
features, &quot;Hmph, I really don&#39;t care what that silly Amazon does.&quot;
 
&quot;Indeed you shouldn&#39;t, girl.&quot; Genma butted in, like he normally does, 
&quot;you should think only of your fianc&eacute;e and not that girl there.  She has 
her own suitor so in the end things will work out, right Tendou?&quot; As 
always, the foolish Saotome elder looked for backup from his old friend.
 
&quot;Yes,&quot; Soun nodded, &quot;and its good to see the girl making new male 
friends, though I pity the young man once that Amazon boy finds out 
about this.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh my.&quot; Kasumi gasped, reacting a bit too much Nabiki thought.
 
&quot;Now, now big sister, don&#39;t worry about him,&quot; Nabiki had to grin, 
&quot;Shampoo will protect him long enough for you to pick up the pieces.&quot; 
Soun blinked at Nabiki while Genma looked on in confusion at the 
comment.
 
&quot;What are you implying, Nabiki dear?&quot; Kasumi face had went pink as her 
father held his attention towards Nabiki.
 
&quot;Oh nothing, just thinking out loud.&quot; Nabiki waved a hand at her Father 
before laying back down, &quot;imagine the words never was spoken.&quot;
 
&quot;Hmmmm.&quot; Soun looked over to the young man sitting behind Shampoo, as he 
applied cream to the Amazon&#39;s back.  Kasumi, meanwhile, sighed and 
pulled out a book that she had brought with her to read and secondly to 
hide the flush feeling to her cheeks.
 
Oh dear, she thought, I wonder where Shampoo found him...
 
* * * *
 
Buildings and houses zoomed by Akane-kun&#39;s eyes as he and Shampoo were 
on the way back to Nerima.  The pair had spent a few hours at the beach, 
though both were unable to enter the surf because of different annoying 
reasons.
 
Feeling a small hand rub against his thigh, Akane turned he&#39;s attention 
back to his partner while raising his eyebrow, &quot;I would have thought 
after that much sun you would want to cool down a bit?&quot;
 
&quot;No be silly,&quot; Shampoo, who was now dressed in simple pair of shorts and 
shirt over her skimpy two-piece lavender coloured bikini, purred out, 
&quot;Shampoo no mind get all hot and bothered again in different way to see 
how Akane perform.&quot;
 
&quot;No doubt.&quot; Akane shook his head in wondert, then his eyes widen as the 
hand became a lot more friendlier as he felt it land on his groin, 
rubbing the stiffness that was building there, &quot;ahhh...*
 
Shampoo softly laughed, as she removed the hand completely, returning it 
to her lap.
 
&quot;Teasing little Amazon.&quot; Mumbled the boy, shifting in his seat.
 
Silence fell over the odd pair, as thoughts of the day went through 
their minds.  It had been an interesting few hours, the two had sat near 
the others while they acted very friendly towards each other.
 
&quot;You know,&quot; Akane finally spoke, &quot;I think after seeing Ranma&#39;s face by 
the time we left, I think he still considers you HIS Chinese fianc&eacute;e.&quot; 
The boy had to smile at some of the facial expressions the red-haired 
girl made with some of the antics he and Shampoo did together.
 
&quot;Shampoo no think Akane be that free with hands at public beach.&quot; Mused 
the Amazon, glancing up at the handsome &#39;boy&#39;.
 
&quot;Well...&quot; He shrugged, &quot;I guess your bad habits are paying off finally.  
Though I kind of surprised myself seeing as my own FATHER was only a few 
meters or so away.&quot;
 
&quot;And your curious sisters.&quot; Added the Amazon.
 
&quot;Eh, well...&quot;
 
&quot;Shampoo notice the looks Nabiki was giving her &#39;little brother&#39;.&quot; And 
the odd behaviour of Kasumi was disturbing, she added silently.
 
&quot;Whatever.  But anyways, I think our little test worked out pretty 
good.&quot; Akane said, as Shampoo nodded in agreement.
 
&quot;By next week this little trip will be forgotten by Ranma, and then 
we&#39;ll have to work on mending tensions.&quot; Akane sighed, knowing it would 
be hard to get Shampoo back into Ranma&#39;s good books after the pair had 
been caught in the act.
 
&quot;Shampoo have no idea how to do that.&quot; The Amazon girl frowned, looking 
out the window as if she was trying to solve the problem by viewing the 
passing buildings.
 
&quot;Well he is pretty stubborn.&quot;
 
&quot;Just like someone Shampoo now REAL well, yes?&quot; Shampoo looked back at 
Akane, a smirk forming on her lips.
 
&quot;Oh? Who&#39;s...Hey!&quot; Akane-kun glared down at the cheeky Amazon, then 
sighed.
 
&quot;Be serious for once Shampoo, or you really don&#39;t care if you lose not 
only respect but your HONOR in your village?&quot;
 
The Amazon lost the expression on her face as the girl looked off into 
space, no doubt many thoughts going through her head.
 
&quot;I&#39;ll admit we screwed up.&quot; Akane sighed, &quot;We should have just told 
Ranma after we mended fences and laid out the real problem that you have 
that only he can help fix.&quot;
 
&quot;Shampoo think Ranma never agree.&quot; The dull tone of the usually cheerful 
Amazon surprised the Tendou heir, but it soon turned to anger very 
quickly.
 
&quot;Don&#39;t you DARE even think of giving up!&quot; That snapped the Amazon back 
to full attention, shocked at the tone of voice Akane had used, &quot;He WILL 
make right of the situation that he&#39;s arrogance help make.&quot;
 
Shampoo looked up in wonder at the determination that was so familiar on 
Ranma&#39;s face when pushed.  It made her feel better seeing Akane act this 
way on her behalf, seeing as no-one else around here ever stood up for 
her culture and traditions.
 
&quot;Thank you.&quot; The purple-haired girl spoke softly, making Akane smile as 
he put his arm around her.
 
&quot;Things will work out,&quot; He said, keeping a firm grip on the Amazon, 
&quot;they have to for everyone&#39;s sake.&quot;
 
After that, the pair remained quite until they finally reached their 
stop.  Walking away from the Bus Stop, Akane continued to reflect on not 
only on the day&#39;s interesting events but on how this all got started.
 
&quot;Sometimes,&quot; The handsome boy mused, &quot;I wonder how us two got into this 
situation.&quot;
 
&quot;Who know, maybe opposite attract?&quot; Shampoo smiled up at the person 
besides her.
 
&quot;Heh, maybe.&quot; As the pair past an alley, Akane suddenly steered the pair 
into the darkness, surprising Shampoo as she found herself pressed up 
against the wall with Akane&#39;s male body rubbing on hers as their lips 
meet.
 
Wrapping her arms around his neck, as well as her legs circling his 
body, she began to rub against the short-haired boy&#39;s hardening member 
as she surrendered to her passions.  The two of them remained that way 
for a time, releasing some of the built-up tension from the beach 
earlier.
 
Finally, their lips as well as their tongues parted as the pair looked 
at each other with clear intent on taking it further.  Of course, things 
don&#39;t always go to plan as Shampoo sadly remembered a promise she gave 
her great-grandmother.
 
&quot;Shampoo wish to continue but...&quot; She sighed heavily, &quot;Elder requested 
Shampoo back before three o&#39;clock
 
&quot;As soon as I...&quot; Akane sighed, shaking his head as Shampoo released him 
and stepped back with her backpack in hand after she had dropped it some 
moments ago.
 
&quot;Akane no worry,&quot; Shampoo gave a look of promise, her reddish-brown eyes 
seem to gleam with lust as she looked at the handsome man before her, 
&quot;we continue this another time and Shampoo show Akane real fun time.&quot;
 
That said, the Amazon spun on her heal and walked back out of the alley, 
hair floating around in the breeze as she disappeared around the corner.
 
&quot;Damn she&#39;s good.&quot; Akane shook his head, wondering how she had fallen 
under the Amazon&#39;s spell.
 
Moving out of the alley, the short-haired boy moved in a different 
direction as the afternoon sun continued to shine brightly.
 
* * * * 
   
After dinner that day...
 
Pausing outside the guestroom of the two Saotomes, Nabiki again thought 
on what she had finally planned on doing.  After seeing today&#39;s events, 
the middle-Tendou sister had seen that things between her sister and 
Ranma hadn&#39;t improved one bit and with what Shampoo had pulled today, 
Nabiki knew she couldn&#39;t ignore current things anymore and that her 
involvement would have to change dramatically.
 
Sliding open the door, the young woman gazed at the dark-haired boy 
kneeling on his futon with his back facing the door.
 
&quot;Yeah?&quot; Nabiki frowned slightly at the lack of emotion in the tone.  
Leaning against the door frame, the girl looked at the boy with a neutal 
expression.
 
&quot;It seems your on a roll of late, Saotome.&quot; She commented, looking to 
see if she spark a reaction of the cursed boy.
 
&quot;Its you.&quot;
 
&quot;Indeed, its little old me Nabiki.&quot; She sighed, knowing playing any of 
her little games wouldn&#39;t work the way she wanted them to.
 
&quot;So I guess you&#39;ll still thinking of today, Hmm?&quot; She inquired . 
 
&quot;Maybe.&quot; He returned with a grunt.
 
&quot;Well, &quot; she drawled out, &quot;jealousy is a nasty thing, and it seems its 
bitten you pretty hard earlier today.&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah right Nabiki, as if I care what that Amazon manic does.&quot; He 
grumbled out, his back still facing Nabiki.
 
&quot;Oh and so you didn&#39;t care when that guy got friendly with his hands and 
groped &#39;certain&#39; places on Shampoo&#39;s body?&quot;
 
Only silence was her reply.
 
&quot;Ranma, Ranma, Ranma,&quot; Nabiki shook her head.  Closing the door she 
stepped towards the boy until she was standing a few feet away, &quot;You do 
know why Shampoo did what she did?&quot;
 
&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; He shrugged, &quot;to get me upset or jealous or something.&quot;
 
&quot;And did she?&quot;
 
Silence again.
 
Nabiki studied the boy from behind for some moments as she weighed her 
options on how to proceed.  Once deciding to do next, Nabiki moved to 
the side and surprised Ranma as she kneeled besides him.
 
&quot;What are you doing here anyways?&quot; He finally asked the question that 
Nabiki had expected.
 
&quot;Because I&#39;m partly responsible for this while thing,&quot; she admitted, 
seeing that there was no point in beating around the bush, &quot;I encourage 
Shampoo, gave her tips and places that Akane liked to be and where she 
would be alone...&quot;
 
&quot;I gathered that last part,&quot; He put in, finally making eye contact with 
the cunning woman besides him, &quot;but why you DO it though? Did I do 
something wrong or was it Shampoo who paid you something you couldn&#39;t 
resist.&quot;
 
Silence filled the air as Ranma stared at the girl, waiting for an 
answer while she looked thoughtful as she thought over what she wanted 
to say.
 
&quot;Truthfully,&quot; Nabiki looked towards the window, a heavy sigh escaping 
from her lips, &quot;I was getting sick and tired of you pussy footing around 
my sister, you not taking your responsibilities for you pass actions 
with the other girls and in general,&quot; she paused, looking back at Ranma 
with a hard stare, &quot;you running away from all the girls when things get 
too hot to handle.&quot;
 
Nabiki had watched the flinching Ranma did as she threw that last 
comment at him, and she could tell that she had hit a raw nerve as Ranma 
looked away.
 
&quot;I can&#39;t help it.&quot; He finally spoke, his voice low, &quot;I&#39;m not used to 
them wanting me so much.&quot;
 
&quot;And why do you care what happens to me anyways.&quot; He mumbled out, &quot;I 
would think you would try now and get rid of me and Pop.&quot;
 
Nabiki looked at Ranma, shaking her head in disappointment.
 
&quot;I thought you knew me better then that, Saotome,&quot; She finally said 
after a moment of thought, &quot;If I really wanted you gone, you wouldn&#39;t 
have survived a month.&quot; She sighed again as she placed a hand on Ranma&#39;s 
shoulder making him look back at her in confusion.
 
&quot;I might be a loner in some ways,&quot; she started to say, &quot;and I&#39;ve 
collected a lot of stupid names like Ice Bitch, Money whore and even 
colourful ones as Spread for Cash.&quot; She had to chuckle at that last 
name, as Ranma looked at her with his eyebrows raised.
 
&quot;I&#39;m not liked and that&#39;s fine by me,&quot; she continued, &quot;but when it comes 
to my few friends that I DO have, I make sure I keep them close.&quot; She 
had to smirk at the surprise look on the boy&#39;s face.
 
&quot;You might not think it but I do consider you a friend, a strange one 
maybe,&quot; she chuckled, &quot;But a friend none the less.&quot;
 
&quot;But...&quot; she withdraw her hand, rubbing her nose, &quot;I misjudged a few 
things, like your reaction, that Akane and Shampoo would sort of gang up 
on you and I thought you would take this as a challenge and get back 
what is yours.&quot;
 
Ranma looked down at that, thinking on Nabiki&#39;s words, &quot;Thanks for 
trying to help, but I just can&#39;t...&quot; His formed his hands into fists, 
frustration clearly showing, &quot;I just don&#39;t know what woman WANT from 
me!&quot;
 
Nabiki remained silent.
 
&quot;And after I started to get a better understanding on what just Akane, 
she goes and lets Shampoo sleep with her!&quot; He shook his head.
 
&quot;Everyone has limits, Ranma,&quot; Nabiki finally spoke up, a thoughtful look 
on her pretty features, &quot;and my baby sister had reached hers and that&#39;s 
why I did what I did since you wouldn&#39;t bite the bullet and sleep with 
her yourself.&quot;
 
Ranma&#39;s face seem to flash red as random images ran through his mind, 
but shook them off not long after they appeared.  Nabiki, meanwhile, 
seemed to have grown a knowing look in her eyes as she regarded the boy.
 
&quot;I&#39;ve considered this for some time now, but I guess with the current 
mess that has popped up...&quot; She moved a bit closer to the boy, &quot;My bet 
is you don&#39;t think you can please Akane in that way, right? And what men 
do with women...&quot;
 
Ranma&#39;s head seem to snap to look at her in shook, as Nabiki continued 
on, &quot;but personally, I think that&#39;s a load of bull.&quot; Her hand moved over 
to Ranma&#39;s bare knee, softly rubbing her fingers over the flesh.
 
Of course, the boy reacted to this as moving away from the warm touch, 
making Nabiki nodded, &quot;Are you scared of a woman&#39;s touch, Ranma?&quot;
 
&quot;Hey! I am NOT!&quot;
 
&quot;Then why did you move away from me, wasn&#39;t doing anything special.&quot; 
Nabiki smiled at the boy.
 
&quot;Um.&quot;
 
&quot;Ranma,&quot; She reached over and took his hand into hers, making him 
flinch, &quot;we girls don&#39;t bite... well maybe a select few in general. But 
in the end all we girls want is a bit of affection once in a while.&quot; She 
sighed.
 
&quot;I&#39;m a grown woman and still haven&#39;t had a steady boyfriend yet,&quot; she 
looked at him, a look that made him swallow hard, &quot;I might be a 
businesswoman but I still need another&#39;s touch.&quot; She moved Ranma&#39;s hand 
up to her covered breast, making the boy jump in surprise but she held 
the hand there firmly.
 
&quot;Um.&quot; He looked away shyly, a nervous look coming over his features, 
&quot;What are you..?&quot;
 
&quot;What&#39;s the matter? Its only a woman&#39;s breast that you&#39;re touching.&quot; She 
mused, &quot;You have two of your very own to play with.&quot; That last part made 
Ranma wince.
 
&quot;Oh come on, the other girls aren&#39;t around to make things hard for you.&quot; 
She used her most gentlest smile she could muster, &quot;So since your hand 
is there, come on...&quot;
 
After some moments of nothing, Nabiki finally felt the hand gently 
squeeze her breast, making her nod, &quot;Very nice, and you notice that the 
walls are still up and there isn&#39;t a line of crazy martial artists after 
your blood.&quot;
 
&quot;Um, well...&quot; Ranma had to admit, it felt nice though his curiosity had 
kicked in and wondered what Nabiki&#39;s breasts felt without a shirt 
covering them.
 
&quot;Then lets try something a bit more daring, Hmmm?&quot; Nabiki removed the 
hand away and moved to be rubbing shoulders with Ranma which made the 
boy&#39;s face redder if possible.
 
&quot;Now,&quot; Nabiki&#39;s hands moved down to grab Ranma&#39;s shorts, &quot;don&#39;t freak 
out.&quot;
 
&quot;Hey!&quot; Ranma jumped slightly in shock which make it easier for the girl 
to pull the boy&#39;s shorts down enough to see his bulging erection.
 
&quot;I see your already at attention, Ranma-kun.&quot; Chuckled the Moneylender, 
as she slightly rubbed her fingers over the confined member, making a 
moan escape Ranma&#39;s lips.
 
&quot;And I see you didn&#39;t mind that either.&quot; The girl seem to get a better 
bold as she took then harden penis and squeezed it.
 
&quot;Oh GOD!&quot; Ranma whispered out, leaning back with his hands now 
supporting him as this woman played with his most private of parts.
 
&quot;Must be very nice, I would gather.&quot; Nabiki licked her lips as she 
watched Ranma&#39;s face, his closed eyes shut tight as he let loose small 
moans as her hand massage his dick.
 
&quot;Now lets see what happens when I do this...&quot; It seemed Ranma didn&#39;t 
care at that point, as Nabiki pulled down his underwear to grasp onto 
the rock hard rod.  It being Nabiki&#39;s first time in being in contact 
with a man&#39;s penis, she was amazed at its texture and the heat that came 
from it.
 
She started to move her hand up and down, feeling a bit of pre-cum 
already leaking out.  These movements continued for around a minute or 
so as she examine Ranma&#39;s groin.  She had by now moved her other hand to 
cup the two small balls of flesh underneath, gently massaging them to 
see what they felt like.
 
&quot;Enjoying yourself, I see.&quot;
 
&quot;Keep going...&quot; He murmured out, seeing to have forgotten for now his 
problems as he sat there enjoying the feelings he was experiencing.
 
&quot;Well then, I guess I should go all the way then...&quot; The girl hesitated 
for a moment once saying that, but shook her head and moved it down to 
kiss the head of the dick.
 
Ranma&#39;s eyes popped open in surprise as he felt wet lips surround the 
top of his dick, a tongue dragging across the skin...
 
&quot;Whoa...&quot; Ranma could feel some sort of pressure building up as Nabiki 
slowly swallowed more and more of his harden dick.  He watched as it all 
disappeared into Nabiki&#39;s mouth in wonder, the feeling of her lips 
teasing his skin...
 
Moving back up, Nabiki thought how weird it was to be doing this to 
Ranma of all people, but considering that the boy needed a distraction, 
she didn&#39;t mind really that much at all.
 
Soon Nabiki started to build up a rhythm, bringing the Saotome heir to 
his first orgasm.  To Ranma, it felt like something was about to blow 
and he wished it would as soon as possible.
 
The first squirt surprised Nabiki, making her cough a little but she 
soon adjusted as more jets of sperm shoot into her mouth.  The taste was 
very odd to Nabiki, as she tasted what she could while the rest dripped 
out of her mouth.
 
Soon Nabiki moved her head back up once Ranma had finished empting his 
load, wiping her mouth as she regarded the boy with a inquiring look, 
&quot;So how was that, Ranma? Enjoyed it?&quot;
 
Opening his eyes to look at Nabiki, she was surprised seeing the intense 
gaze, &quot;Whoa... that was unbelievable, I didn&#39;t know you could do that.&quot;
 
&quot;Well...&quot; She drawled out, licking her lips, &quot;I surprise myself though 
by the look you&#39;ll giving me it seems you want a little more.&quot;
 
&quot;Um, well...&quot;
 
&quot;Since it seems we have come to a understanding of sorts,&quot; she said, 
standing up,&quot;if you want to explore more of that with me, come to my 
room once everyone is asleep.&quot;
 
Ranma looked surprised at the woman, &quot;but why?&quot;
 
She shrugged, &quot;I guess I enjoyed myself a bit too much and I&#39;m curious 
to see what else could happen between us.&quot; She paused for a moment, &quot;and 
seeing that look in your eyes that reminds me when you want to learn 
something new about martial arts...&quot;
 
&quot;But what about the others...&quot;
 
&quot;What about them?&quot; She gave him a look, &quot;its not as if I&#39;m in love with 
you, just that we both have lusts that are needed to be satisfied.&quot;
 
&quot;So if you want to be my first, come to my room later.&quot; And with that, 
the woman walked out of the room  closing the door behind her.
 
Ranma looked at where she had left, then down at his groin in thought.
 
&quot;Hmmmm...I wonder...&quot;
 
Later that night, if anyone was awake they would have wondered what the 
weird sounds were that was coming from Nabiki&#39;s room....
 
 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;End of Chapter 5.
 
 
Author Notes:
            And its finally done... (wipes forehead).  Sorry to everyone 
out there who wanted to see more of this.  Main reason was lack of 
interest in the Ranma &frac12; series. I had became a fan of another anime 
series called Battle Athletes Victory.  But now, since I got that out of 
my system I&#39;m back at work with this fanfic.
 
            I just hope I didn&#39;t piss off any more people with this one 
:).  Anyways, hope you enjoyed this chapter and look out for the next as 
it shouldn&#39;t be that far away I hope.
 
Next up:
            Sides have been chosen it seems, as Nabiki and Ranma plot 
while Akane wonders what is her sister up to THIS time.  And the others? 
Will lets just say Shampoo gets nailed the good way and leave it as 
that...
