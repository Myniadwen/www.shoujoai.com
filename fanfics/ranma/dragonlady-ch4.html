<a href="../ranma/dragonlady-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>June 2008...

&quot;I know I&#39;ve met most of you personally since you&#39;ve begun to arrive on 
Macross Island,&quot; Roy said from front of the room, &quot;but let me say again, 
welcome to the RDF gentlemen and lady. Over the next two weeks we will 
have a lot of classroom time while you learn the new systems and 
controls of the VF-1 Valkyrie. I will try to break that up with actual 
views of the aircraft. During this time you will also all be issued your 
new helmets. If you brought your old helmets with you, they are 
memorabilia now. Each day after class, one of you will report to the 
medical science team so that your new helmets may be calibrated.

&quot;Lieutenant Saotome,&quot; Roy addressed Ranma. &quot;Ladies first. You&#39;re to 
report after class today. It seems the medical staff had caught wind of 
your exceptional bodily control and your status as a high level martial 
artist. They can&#39;t wait to see how that will affect your neural link 
capability.&quot;

&quot;Aye aye, Sir,&quot; Ranma responded.

The rest of the 8 hour class was fairly dry, but Roy managed to keep it 
from inducing somnolence by virtue of his anecdotes and the novelty of 
the subject matter. Ranma, for her part, was torn by her up coming trip 
to the medical science department. She didn&#39;t relish being a lab rat, 
but at the same time, she was also eager to see how her abilities would 
affect this new control system.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;CDR Fokker,&quot; Roy announced as he picked up the phone. &quot;Calm down, 
Doctor Lang and tell me what the problem is in English...I need to get 
down there right away? Why?...Lieutenant Saotome? Is she alright?...Oh, 
I see...So what&#39;s so incredible that I have to see for myself?...Better 
than me, you say?...Alright I&#39;m on my way.&quot;

Roy jumped up and headed over to the Medical labs. He had never seen Dr. 
Lang quite so excited, but it figured that Ranma would be at the root of 
it. The girl definitely had a knack for causing a stir.

Five minutes later he walked into Lang&#39;s office where the scientist was 
avidly pouring over graphs displayed on his computer screen.

&quot;Okay, I&#39;m here,&quot; Roy said. &quot;Now what&#39;s so amazing?&quot;

&quot;One moment, Commander,&quot; Lang pulled up another chart which displayed a 
jagged line a little above half way through the range with an aggregate 
displayed at the bottom reading 64 percent. &quot;These are the results of 
your last Neural Link calibration. Remember when we started the program 
that the best you could achieve was about 45 percent. Over the years 
it&#39;s become easier for you to form a link with the control systems, but 
you have leveled out recently. You shouldn&#39;t expect to achieve much more 
than a 70 percent link. We all thought that might be the ceiling since 
you have responded better than anyone else we&#39;ve processed so 
far...until today.&quot;

Lang pulled up another chart with a jagged line running near the top of 
the range. The number at the bottom read a staggering 94 percent.

&quot;These are Lieutenant Saotome&#39;s calibration results,&quot; Dr. Lang explained 
excitedly. &quot;On her first try, she has reached near total link with the 
systems. In fact, for all intents and purposes a 6 percent gap is 
meaningless. She will be able to do things with mecha that that would 
seem impossible. The mecha would act as an extension of her own body. 
The fact is; we are going to have to modify the software to install 
feedback limits just for her. If her Veritech were to get shot up with 
that degree of link, it would easily kill her.&quot;

&quot;How is that possible, Doc?&quot; Roy asked in amazement.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure, but I have a theory,&quot; Lang explained. &quot;Mind you, we can&#39;t 
prove it because we currently have no way to measure it. Are you 
familiar with the concept of &#39;ki&#39;, Commander?&quot;

&quot;Asians believe it&#39;s some sort of life force that every living being 
has, right?&quot; Roy replied.

&quot;Correct,&quot; Lang said. &quot;It&#39;s no secret that every living being is 
surrounded by an energy field. Tesla had experimented with this but it 
was first officially discovered by a Russian medical tech named Kirlian. 
He was the first to photograph what is now known as the Kirlian aura, 
the energy field that surrounds a living thing and what I believe to be 
the &#39;ki&#39; energy that the Asians speak of. Now for people like you or me, 
this energy is only visible when viewed with Kirlian photography, but it 
is said that ancient martial arts masters who have studied techniques 
for ki manipulation for decades are able to produce a visible aura of 
their ki. I never believed that until today.&quot;

&quot;Why until today?&quot; Roy asked.

&quot;Because Lieutenant Saotome showed me what she calls her &#39;battle aura&#39;,&quot; 
Lang said smugly. &quot;She produced a pale blue aura that extended several 
inches away from her body. She said she learned to do it from an old 
master she trained with while on a ten year martial arts training 
journey. She said it&#39;s really nothing more than a light show meant to 
intimidate an enemy by displaying your power level. She went on to say 
the real use of her ki was to augment her strength and speed and 
accelerate her healing. She channels her ki into her muscles or into a 
wounded part of her body to produce the effects. She also says that she 
can channel her ki into a weapon to both strengthen it and give her 
better control over it. We believe that&#39;s how she is achieving this 
level of link with the neural interface.&quot;

&quot;Then why can&#39;t everyone do it?&quot; Roy asked.

&quot;Years of training,&quot; Lang replied. &quot;Lieutenant Saotome explained that ki 
is like a muscle, the more you use it, the more there is to use and the 
more you are able to use. We tested her and I personally saw her lift 
400 kilos from the floor to above her head with very little strain. She 
ran 20 miles on a treadmill in an hour without appearing fatigued. She 
performed what she called a speed kata for us that we couldn&#39;t follow 
with our naked eyes. We had to slow the video down to see what she had 
actually done.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s inhuman,&quot; Roy said, astounded. Had it been anyone but Lang 
telling him this he would have called them a liar to their face.

&quot;Apparently not,&quot; Lang replied. &quot;She says it can be trained. I asked if 
that was so then why weren&#39;t there more of these super powered martial 
artists around. While she told me there were more than you might think, 
it was true they are small in number because few would people would 
voluntarily go through the insane and often deadly training methods 
needed to achieve levels like hers. She said fewer still would be 
willing to use those training methods to train someone. When I asked why 
she trained with such methods, she explained it was her misfortune to 
have a father that was obsessed with the art and the more insane and 
dangerous the training method was, the more likely he was to use it on 
her.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Roy said. &quot;So what does this mean?&quot;

&quot;It means that you have a very special pilot on your hands, Commander,&quot; 
Lang grinned. &quot;One that will likely eclipse you in skill and ability and 
one that appears ideally suited to this new technology. And as a bonus, 
she says she can teach others meditation techniques that might improve 
their ability to use the neural link.&quot;

&quot;And you think I should allow this,&quot; Roy stated.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Lang said. &quot;It won&#39;t hurt and it will be interesting to see the 
results. Lieutenant Saotome did caution that some people wouldn&#39;t have 
the mental discipline to use the techniques and for those that did, it 
could take years for them to approach her current level. I think it 
would be well worth the effort even if only a handful of pilots managed 
to benefit from it.&quot;

&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll talk to Lieutenant Saotome and, if she&#39;s willing, I&#39;ll set 
something up in the training schedule,&quot; Roy nodded.

(oO\O/Oo)

A couple of days later a new item was introduced into the training plan. 
Now, every morning after breakfast, the class would meet in the dojo 
room of the gym and Ranma would teach meditation and focusing techniques 
to the pilots. As predicted some pilots responded better than others.

Lang was able to draw a direct correlation between the more mentally 
disciplined pilots that were achieving some degree of success with 
Ranma&#39;s techniques and their level of bond with the neural link. These 
pilots would achieve an initial calibration percentage in the 40 to 50 
percent range while the ones that were unable to grasp what Ranma was 
teaching fell somewhat below that.

The class was taking one of its hourly breaks from the classroom 
sessions one day when two of the pilots were talking about the 
techniques.

&quot;I think it&#39;s a big waste of time,&quot; LT Chuck Brown was saying to his 
classmate. He was one of the ones that wasn&#39;t responding to the 
training. Whether that was lack of interest or lack of ability wasn&#39;t 
known since LT Brown frequently fell asleep during the meditation 
sessions.

&quot;I dunno,&quot; LT Clark Jones said uncertainly. &quot;The brass seems to think 
it&#39;s a good idea.&quot; LT Jones hadn&#39;t been making much headway with the 
techniques, but he was slowly improving. He hadn&#39;t been to the 
calibration yet.

&quot;I say it&#39;s all a bunch of mystical mumbo jumbo,&quot; Brown sneered. Ranma 
who had overheard them, felt compelled to put her two yen in.

&quot;You really should make an effort with this,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I mean, you 
have to attend anyway and it might make you a better pilot.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t need some little girl to tell me how to be a combat pilot, Miss 
Lieutenant, Junior Grade,&quot; Brown said arrogantly. Ranma&#39;s head jerked 
back as if slapped. &quot;What would you know about combat flying anyway? 
Probably only ever dropped a couple of bombs on undefended targets in 
mop up operations.&quot;

Ranma clenched her fists and was quickly considering how much trouble 
she would get in for breaking this jerk&#39;s face. Probably not a whole 
lot, she decided, since he only out ranked her by a grade and she was 
provoked. She was just about to tear him a new one when the other pilot 
spoke up.

&quot;Shut up, you idiot!&quot; Jones snapped. &quot;If you took your eyes off her 
breasts long enough you would see the ribbons on her chest. You don&#39;t 
get two Distinguished Flying Crosses and a Navy Cross for bombing 
undefended targets. Besides, I heard about her from my buddy that flew 
with her as her wingman. She saved his ass.

&quot;He took some ground fire while on a CAS mission and had to punch out 
when his plane failed while outbound from the target area. She stayed in 
the area, forcing the enemy ground forces in route to capture him to 
retreat by strafing them with the last of her 20mm ammo then went 
against two Hinds UNARMED. She managed to crash one and distracted the 
other until the extraction team got there to pull Eddie out.

&quot;He said she&#39;s a shit-hot pilot with stones the size of a battleship, 
even if she is female,&quot; Jones said with amusement.

&quot;So she has some CAS experience, big deal,&quot; Brown dismissed. &quot;Flying 
head to head against other pilots is where the real challenge is.&quot;

&quot;How many months of combat have you seen?&quot; Jones smirked.

&quot;I&#39;ve had a total of thirty-six months of deployment over the last five 
years,&quot; Brown replied.

&quot;And how many air-to-air kills have you gotten and in how many 
engagements,&quot; Jones inquired, still smirking.

&quot;I have four kills in four engagements,&quot; Brown said proudly.

&quot;Lieutenant Saotome?&quot; Jones prompted.

&quot;I have a total of sixteen months of deployment over the last sixteen 
months and I have six air-to-air kills over four engagements. Two of 
those were Su-27&#39;s in one engagement. I got one Mig 29 while fighting 
our way into a target area and the other three were attack helos 
harassing our ground troops.&quot;

&quot;I dunno, Chuck,&quot; Jones chuckled. &quot;It sounds to me like she&#39;s pretty 
much got the credentials to tell you a thing or two about flying 
combat.&quot;

Brown glared at Ranma as she stood there smirking while smugly examining 
her nails. Inside, Brown was impressed with Ranma&#39;s accomplishments in 
her relatively short time in the UNEDF, but his pride would never let 
him admit that and he continued to think her techniques were a waste of 
time, which is probably why his calibration score was one of the lowest 
in the class at a paltry 28 percent. While anything over 20 percent was 
enough to pilot a Veritech, until he improved the link, Brown would be a 
clumsy if adequate battloid pilot.

(oO\O/Oo)

As Veritech training progressed, so too did Lieutenant Brown&#39;s 
resentment of Ranma when she consistently out scored him on the class 
material and out performed him in the simulators. It didn&#39;t help that 
she had begun to jump his shit when she caught him sleeping in her 
training sessions. The man&#39;s animosity was encouraged when he found a 
couple of cohorts in the class that had begun to resent her due to Roy&#39;s 
perceived favoritism.

Not that they said anything with in earshot of anyone else in the class. 
Several of them either had first hand knowledge of her heroism or had 
heard about her exploits from others that had. She was well respected by 
most of her classmates. By now, all the neural link calibrations had 
been done and everyone knew about Ranma&#39;s incredible calibration score. 
They recognized the respect Roy paid her for what it was, regard for 
someone he deeply respected and was grooming for command.

What her detractors didn&#39;t realize was that Roy was pushing Ranma harder 
than anyone else in the class. Ranma, being very driven herself, either 
didn&#39;t notice, or welcomed the challenge. She always stepped up and 
delivered, no matter what Roy threw at her.

That&#39;s not to say that she didn&#39;t make her share of blunders. They were 
usually small ones and make little difference to the outcome of whatever 
trial Roy was putting her through, but Roy never failed to call her on 
them ruthlessly, much to the amusement of her anti-fan club. Most of the 
time, Roy chastised her for taking too many risks. This was frustrating 
for Ranma because her keen tactical mind simply didn&#39;t function like 
most others did, therefore, she couldn&#39;t grasp the threshold of when to 
play things safe and disengage and when to stay and fight.

She could clearly see victory in her grasp long after others thought it 
was a lost cause. Not that it was due to any sort of prideful self 
delusion, it was simply that she could see and plan several moves in 
advance what needed to happen for her to come out on top. Unfortunately, 
she was many times crippled by her wingman. Her abilities to hold a 
high-g maneuver indefinitely, without blacking out, far outstripped any 
of her fellow pilots. Saddled with the need to protect her wingman, she 
often found her path to victory vanishing before her eyes.

This was a hard lesson for her and one that she hadn&#39;t really had to 
deal with much before when flying F/A 18&#39;s. The structural limits of the 
airframe kept her close to the limits of her fellow pilots. With the 
Valkyries, though, the airframe could stand stresses far in excess of 
what was aerodynamically possible to apply in flight. Consequently, she 
was now having to learn when to break off an engagement that she could 
win for the sake of her squadron mates. It was a tough pill for her to 
swallow, but one Roy was determined to force down her throat.

For her part, as much as Ranma wanted to let the others break from the 
engagement and leave her to finish things up, she still recognized the 
importance of being a team player. So she strove to find a medium 
between her abilities, victory, and the abilities of her fellows. She 
often missed the mark but, eventually, she improved.

(oO\O/Oo)

August 2008...

It was the last couple of weeks of class and everyone had been 
thoroughly checked out on operating the Valkyrie. Roy had begun 
organizing the class for transition to its roll as an operational 
squadron when he announced he had a surprise for everyone. He led them 
all out to the flight line. When they arrived they saw 16 shiny new 
VF-1&#39;s. One was an S model, Roy pointed out. That would be his bird and 
it was designated Skull One. There were also three J models which would 
be given to the flight leaders. The remaining 12 were A models which 
would comprise the bulk of Skull Squadron. Skull One and the J models 
were painted white with black and yellow livery with black tails 
displaying a skull and crossbones prominently. The A models were all 
painted a light brown with black and yellow accents and a black skull 
and crossbones on brown tails.

Roy had them form up and stood in front of them.

&quot;Based on your performance in the class, sims, and actual flying, I&#39;ve 
made the assignments for Skull Squadron,&quot; he announced. &quot;I&#39;ll start with 
the flight leaders. When you hear your name step forward and stand on 
the yellow line. I will, of course, be the flight leader for Alpha 
Flight. Lieutenant Commander Kramer, you get Bravo Flight. Lieutenant 
Jones, you will be leading Charlie Flight. Lieutenant Saotome, Delta 
Flight is yours.&quot; Some grumbling was heard as Ranma took her position on 
the yellow line. &quot;Brown, you have a problem with my choices?&quot;

&quot;With all due respect, Sir, several of us have higher rank and more 
flight hours than Lieutenant Saotome,&quot; Brown said, practically spitting 
Ranma&#39;s rank.

&quot;Yeah, and?&quot; Roy asked.

&quot;Well, one of us should get the flight leader position,&quot; Brown said, 
making an effort to keep the anger out of his voice.

&quot;Perhaps you missed the part where I said my assignments were based on 
performance, Lieutenant,&quot; Roy said. &quot;That would put you in the bottom 
third of the class. The only reason Lieutenant Saotome isn&#39;t my 2IC is 
because she doesn&#39;t have the rank or experience to warrant it. As for 
her ability, she has that in spades. I suggest you adjust your attitude, 
Mister Brown. Don&#39;t think I&#39;m unaware of your trash talking behind 
Lieutenant Saotome&#39;s back. That Navy Cross she earned commands our 
respect for her and her abilities and you will give her the respect she 
is due. Am I making myself clear, Mister Brown?&quot; Roy gave the man a 
glare that would have peeled paint at fifty paces.

&quot;Yes, SIR!&quot; Brown said crisply, gulping. Roy held the glare for a few 
minutes longer then moved on.

Brown and the other Ranma detractors where broken up between Alpha, 
Bravo, and Charlie Flights. Brown being in Alpha where Roy could keep an 
eye on him. For Ranma&#39;s flight, Roy selected the three pilots with the 
most endurance to g-loading so as to limit her as little as possible. 
Her three flight mates were Lieutenant JG Sven &quot;Thor&quot; Christensen, 
Lieutenant JG Kyo &quot;Yoyo&quot; Morita and Ensign Ross &quot;Gravy&quot; Davies.

(oO\O/Oo)

Now was when the real training began. Skull began to train as a combat 
unit. All the pilots where experienced to some degree with combat 
flying, so a majority of the training was ground based in battloid mode. 
To do this, they would go up against Marine Destroid units on one of the 
uninhabited islands that dotted the South Pacific. The island was large 
and wooded with structures from a previous venture that had been based 
there. It was now designated a bombing range and the perfect place to 
train in the classified Veritech guardian and battloid modes.

Skull had all been briefed on Destroid unit tactics as a basis for what 
they would be using. However, while similar in some aspects, Veritechs 
were not Destriods so they were not only there to train but to develop 
new tactics that used the Veritech&#39;s multiple configurations and 
maneuverability to their advantage.

Ammo would be paint shells and once on the island, Skull would be 
prohibited from using fighter mode. Roy had planned the training 
operation with competition between his flights in mind. The &#39;objective&#39; 
was a hill in the approximate center of the island. Each flight would 
start from a different side and fight their way to the objective. Each 
approach was planned to provide a different terrain challenge. One 
approach would be heavily wooded, another would be through a small 
village of industrial structures and bombed out buildings, a third would 
be across open rocky ground, while the fourth would be through a marsh.

The Marine Destriods were to try to prevent Skull from reaching the top 
of the hill. Their strength was unknown but &#39;intel&#39; said that Skull 
would be at a two to one disadvantage. How these numbers were deployed 
was unknown although the Marines were aware of the routes of ingress.

A mecha would be considered &quot;killed&quot; after receiving at least two hits 
to the upper body or one hit to the legs.

Delta Flight drew the wooded approach for the first day. After that the 
Flights would rotate the approaches clockwise the following day. Ranma 
sat at their starting point examining her map. They had been given an 
hour before they were to begin the exercise and she and her team we 
dismounted and having a little planning session.

&quot;What are you thinking, DL,&quot; Christensen asked in his Norwegian accent.

&quot;I&#39;m thinking I don&#39;t like this,&quot; Ranma replied. &quot;Look here. See this 
ridge line that cuts across our mission area? There&#39;s only going to be a 
limited number of places we can go by that. Here would be the obvious 
place.&quot; Ranma pointed to a narrow gap where the ridge dipped down making 
a natural pathway. &quot;You can bet the Marines are going to have that one 
covered nine ways to Sunday. We can likely jump the ridge in guardian 
mode here, here, or here, but we&#39;ll make a lot of noise doing it. Our 
speed won&#39;t do us much good in this terrain either so I would expect 
that even if we did make it around the forces they are going to have 
covering the gap, they will probably have reserve units pulled back that 
will move to intercept us once they know where we are. That would leave 
their ambushing forces time to move to take us from the flank.&quot;

&quot;So what are we going to do?&quot; Davies asked.

&quot;We&#39;re going to be sneaky and deceitful and then take a gamble,&quot; Ranma 
grinned.

&quot;Do tell,&quot; Morita grinned.

&quot;Okay, we are going to head to this western most crossing point here,&quot; 
Ranma pointed to one that was farthest from the gap. We&#39;ll jump the 
ridge here, high and noisy-like, making sure we have their attention. 
Then we&#39;ll slip back over to this side. Their reserve unit will move to 
engage us. I&#39;m gambling that the unit covering the gap will either pull 
back to guard the approach to the hill, or move to engage our flank. 
While they are doing that, we&#39;ll parallel the ridge and go straight 
through the gap traveling at best speed and angling east. Hopefully by 
the time they realized they&#39;ve been duped, we&#39;ll be too far ahead of 
them for them to catch us.&quot;

&quot;Brilliant,&quot; Christensen said high-fiveing Morita.

&quot;Yeah, well, don&#39;t go celebrating yet,&quot; Ranma cautioned. &quot;If I&#39;m wrong 
and they don&#39;t fall for it, leaving the pass, we will get ripped to 
shreds. They&#39;ll have the high ground and most likely be firing from 
cover. We won&#39;t be able to use guardian mode with all these trees and 
that&#39;s going to limit our mobility advantage.&quot;

Two and a half hours later Delta Flight passed through the gap and met 
no resistance. The three men were exultant, but Ranma remained 
apprehensive. They still had several kilometers to go and things could 
get ugly. As they approached the hill, their mission area would get 
smaller and the likelihood of them being spotted would increase.

&quot;Alright, Delta, calm down and keep you eyes open,&quot; Ranma ordered. 
&quot;We&#39;re not there yet.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re home free, DL, what could go wrong?&quot; Gravy asked over the comm. 
Ranma wanted to bang her head on the instrument panel.

&quot;Gravy, never EVER say something like that,&quot; Ranma commanded. &quot;Cause, 
guaranteed, you&#39;ll find out what can go wrong.&quot;

Sure enough, they had gotten within a kilometer of the hill when Thor 
spoke up.

&quot;Contact!&quot; the Norwegian announced. &quot;Three o&#39;clock and closing fast. 
Estimate one minute until we start taking fire.&quot;

&quot;Aright, gentlemen, you just found out what happens when you ask what 
could go wrong,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Move out, best speed. The time for stealth 
is over. We need to get in between them and the hill before we are 
engaged. Stay together though.&quot;

Delta flight had just managed to get in front of the Destroid forces 
when paint rounds began to spatter the trees around them. Ranma spun her 
battloid and began to return fire.

&quot;Okay, people, listen up,&quot; she said over the comm. &quot;Gravy and I are 
going to provide suppressing fire. Thor, you and Yoyo move toward the 
hill about fifty meters then you will provide suppressing fire as Gravy 
and I move up. We&#39;ll repeat the process until we break the tree line, 
then if we are still under fire we&#39;ll increase the jumps to 100 meters. 
Got it?&quot; Thor and Gravy gave &quot;Roger&quot;s, but Yoyo had a question.

&quot;Ma&#39;am, why don&#39;t we just make a break for it,&quot; he asked. &quot;We&#39;re almost 
there and once we reach the tree line they can&#39;t catch us.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re too close to the hill for me to give them a shot at my back, 
Yoyo,&quot; Ranma answered. &quot;We&#39;ve all gotten this far and we&#39;ll all reach 
the hill &#39;alive&#39;. The best way to do that is to provide cover fire for 
each other while we move.&quot;

&quot;Roger, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Yoyo said.

They had just broke the tree line when Roy&#39;s voice came over the command 
channel.

&quot;Skull Alpha Lead to Delta Lead, Status, Dragon Lady?&quot; he asked.

&quot;We&#39;re a little busy, Cowboy,&quot; Ranma answered as she laid down a burst 
of fire and prepared to move up. &quot;We&#39;re about three hundred meters from 
the hill with two companies of Marines breathing down our necks. Looks 
like we&#39;ll be the first to reach the hill.&quot;

&quot;Heh, dream on Dragon Lady,&quot; Roy said. &quot;My ETA is less than two minutes 
to the top of the hill and we&#39;re well in front of the resistance.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;ll be close then, Cowboy,&quot; Ranma fired back. Switching to Delta&#39;s 
channel, &quot;Okay people, the race is on. Alpha is less the two minutes 
from the hill. If we want to win this, we have to hurry up every time we 
get the chance. Two hundred meter jumps and go to guardian mode now that 
we have some open ground.&quot;

A minute and a half later, Alpha Lead stepped over the line a heartbeat 
ahead of Delta Lead. However, the remaining Alpha member was lagging 
behind while the rest of Delta stepped across right behind Ranma.

&quot;Delta Flight in has the hill,&quot; Ranma chirped as her last mecha stepped 
across. Ten seconds later, the last Alpha mecha entered the mission 
complete area.

&quot;Alpha Lead was here first,&quot; Roy said.

&quot;So how we gonna call it, Cowboy?&quot; Ranma asked. &quot;You may have been the 
first on the hill, but my entire flight completed the mission objective 
before yours did.&quot;

&quot;Your whole flight made it, huh?&quot; Roy asked, even though they were 
standing right in front of each other.

&quot;Yup,&quot; Ranma confirmed, looking at her people. Each of them had one hit 
on their torso, but the Marines never managed a second hit on any of 
them. &quot;Who&#39;d you lose?&quot;

&quot;We lost Doodoo and Spinner,&quot; Roy answered. &quot;Doodoo managed to lose it 
while evading and buried the nose of his guardian past the cockpit in 
the mud before receiving a new paint job before he could extract 
himself. Spinner got caught when they concentrated fire on him.&quot;

Ranma laughed at the thought of Lieutenant Brown with the nose of his 
Veritech buried in the mud.

&quot;Poor Doodoo,&quot; Ranma snickered. The rest of her flight chuckled.

&quot;Well, since you managed to bring your whole flight through, I&#39;m going 
to concede the victory to you, Dragon Lady,&quot; Roy laughed. &quot;Good work.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Cowboy,&quot; Ranma said as Delta Flight cheered. &quot;What about Bravo 
and Charlie?&quot;

&quot;Bravo got pasted,&quot; Roy said. &quot;The entire flight. Charlie is still 
alive, but lost a mecha. The street fighting really bogged them down. 
They should be here in about a half an hour.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

The rest of the exercises worked out about the same. Thanks to Roy&#39;s 
experience and Ranma&#39;s brilliant tactical mind, Alpha and Delta always 
made it to the hill ahead of the others. Ranma flight never suffered 
more than one loss while Roy&#39;s flight never made it through unscathed.

In fact, Chuck &quot;Doodoo&quot; Brown never survived at all. If one didn&#39;t know 
any better one would have thought the Marines had singled him out to 
take out at all costs. Why else would they be willing to accept losses 
just to &quot;kill&quot; him? Why else would they ignore the rest of Alpha flight 
until they took Doodoo down? It must have been imagination. After all, 
it&#39;s not as if the Marines had a reason to single the hapless pilot out. 
It wasn&#39;t as if the Marines were part of the Dragon Lady fan club, 
right? It wasn&#39;t as if they could have known about Doodoo&#39;s attitude 
toward the Dragon lady, right? It wasn&#39;t as if Roy was smiling every 
time poor Doodoo got a new paint job, was he? Nah, it was just a 
coincidence...right?

By the time each flight had gone through each approach twice, Alpha and 
Delta had four victories each. Delta had received fewer losses but had a 
lower &quot;kill&quot; tally. It was decided that Alpha would have the bragging 
rights because the gap between Alpha&#39;s and Delta&#39;s &quot;kill&quot; tally was far 
larger than the gap between their loss tally.
