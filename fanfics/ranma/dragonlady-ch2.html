Ranma stood in the lobby of her barracks building looking at photos of 
the SDF-1 taken at various times since its crash on Macross Island. She 
was thinking about a certain dark skinned self-appointed social 
director. She couldn&#39;t help but smile as she thought of Claudia Grant, 
the third and last person to know her secret and one of two people still 
alive that she considered a true friend. She would never forget the 
night she confessed herself to Claudia...

(oO\O/Oo)

9 months ago...

&quot;Hey Ranma,&quot; Claudia grinned. &quot;You ready to go?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I guess,&quot; Ranma said coming out of the barracks in her 
ground-side casual uniform. This consisted of a black jacket with a gray 
striped collar and pale purple piping over a black skirt that fell to 
just below her mid thigh. On her feet were black flats and her crimson 
hair was in a French braid, tied with a black velvet ribbon. &quot;I still 
don&#39;t see why you insist on dragging me out.&quot;

&quot;Like you have anything better to do,&quot; Claudia smirked. &quot;You need to 
decompress, girlfriend. You have no social life.&quot; Claudia straightened 
her own uniform which was like Ranma&#39;s except hers was khaki with black 
stripes on the collar and had white piping.

&quot;Maybe I don&#39;t want a social life,&quot; Ranma griped. Claudia rolled her 
eyes.

&quot;I guess that&#39;s really too bad then, because I&#39;m dragging you out and we 
are going to have fun tonight,&quot; Claudia laughed.

&quot;If you weren&#39;t my friend...&quot; Ranma said darkly.

&quot;Lucky thing for you, I am your friend, Miss Jet Jockey,&quot; Claudia said 
as they drove to the club. Ranma snorted.

Several minutes later they pulled into the parking lot of &#39;The Vortex&#39;, 
a popular club frequented by UNEDF personnel. Claudia shut the car off 
and looked over at Ranma.

&quot;Well, we&#39;re here,&quot; Claudia observed. &quot;Now just take that scowl of your 
pretty face and let&#39;s go inside.&quot; Ranma glared at the dark-skinned 
woman. &quot;Oh come on, Ranma, let&#39;s see that smile that melts hearts all 
over the base...pleeeeease? For me?&quot; Ranma held out for almost 20 
seconds of Claudia&#39;s pleading before finally giving in and giving a 
slight smile. &quot;Good girl. Now lets party!&quot; Ranma snorted again as they 
got out of the vehicle and made their way inside the club.

It was early yet so they didn&#39;t have a hard time finding a table to sit 
at. Ranma insisted that they take one in a dark corner in spite of 
Claudia&#39;s protests that they should sit where they could be better seen. 
Claudia eventually backed down and the two women sat at the table Ranma 
wanted. Soon the waitress came over and took their orders.

Ranma sighed in delight as she polished off her third cheese burger. She 
daintily wiped her hands on the napkin and then drained her third beer. 
Claudia just shook her head at the spectacle.

&quot;Bitch,&quot; Claudia said playfully. &quot;You must have a tape worm or something 
to eat that much and still stay so slender.&quot;

&quot;Or something,&quot; Ranma agreed with a smirk.

Things had really started to pick up as the club filled up. The music 
played loudly as Ranma and Claudia shouted over it, swapping stories and 
laughing as the alcohol loosened them up, well, loosened Ranma up anyway 
since Claudia was not very uptight to begin with.

&quot;You dated THE Roy Fokker?&quot; Ranma said with wide eyes.

&quot;Yup,&quot; Claudia nodded. &quot;He was a bit of a playboy, but he was a riot to 
hang out with. That&#39;s one man that knew how to have fun, unlike some 
other pilots I know.&quot; Ranma stuck her tongue out at Claudia and they 
both started laughing.

&quot;Hello there,&quot; Ranma looked up from her laughter to see a young UNEDF 
Marine lieutenant with an Australian accent standing next to her. He 
stuck out his hand to the redhead. &quot;I&#39;m Russ Newton.&quot; Ranma grimaced.

&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Ranma said in a flat tone. &quot;I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;m not 
interested in getting picked up so please shove off, Lieutenant,&quot; Ranma 
said with a hint of frost. Claudia eyed the hunk that Ranma was in the 
process of shooting down.

&quot;Don&#39;t be rude, Ranma,&quot; Claudia grinned. She stuck out her hand. &quot;Hi, 
I&#39;m Claudia Grant, and my brusque friend here is Ranma Saotome.&quot; The 
man&#39;s eyes widened.

&quot;You mean Ranma &#39;the Dragon Lady&#39; Saotome?&quot; the young officer said in 
surprise.

&quot;That&#39;s the one,&quot; Claudia confirmed.

&quot;Hey fellas! You gotta come over here!&quot; Newton yelled and waved to the 
group of men at the table Russ Newton had come from.

Ranma rolled her eyes and glared at Claudia. Claudia smirked back. Soon 
the table was surrounded by jarheads.

&quot;Hey fellas,&quot; Newton said, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet THE &#39;Dragon Lady&#39;.&quot; All 
the men looked surprised and then cheered. Ranma suddenly found her back 
slapped and her hand pumped by all the jarheads as they introduced 
themselves.

&quot;Hey Ranma,&quot; Claudia grinned, &quot;you never told me you were famous.&quot;

&quot;You bet she is, Ma&#39;am,&quot; a sergeant spoke up. &quot;Our battalion was moving 
in on a large rebel force in hills of Greece. Our company got cut off 
and pinned down by a couple of Hinds. The gunships took out our LAVs and 
Humvees and we had a lot of wounded. We couldn&#39;t get a medivac in 
because of the gunships and we could see a rebel tank company and about 
two companies of infantry moving into the valley.

&quot;We thought we were finished when suddenly one of the Hinds blew apart. 
Then this Super Hornet rockets into the valley and strafes the shit out 
of the other Hind. Even as its flaming wreckage is falling, the Hornet 
flies down the valley and launches a spread of Mavericks at the rebel 
armor. On the second pass, the third tank is taken out. The Hornet comes 
around for a third time and shacks the last tank with a GBU before 
making a fourth run dropping a cluster bomb.

&quot;The enemy infantry pulled back in disarray while the Hornet orbited the 
area while we waited for the medivacs came in. We found out from the 
chopper pilots that we owed our asses to the Dragon Lady who had 
requested permission to break away from her flight to assist us. We&#39;d 
have been dead meat if it hadn&#39;t been for her.&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; Lieutenant Newton agreed. &quot;What do you say fella&#39;s, are we 
lettin&#39; the Dragon Lady here pay for anything tonight?&quot;

&quot;Hell NO!&quot; the marines barked in unison.

&quot;Thanks, Guys,&quot; Ranma said blushing, &quot;but really, I was just doing my 
job. It was nothing anybody else would have done.&quot;

&quot;But you were the one that did, love,&quot; Newton grinned.

&quot;Now don&#39;t you feel bad for being rude earlier, Lieutenant?&quot; Claudia 
teased.

&quot;S&#39;okay,&quot; Newton smiled. &quot;As lovely as Dragon Lady here is, I&#39;m sure she 
gets tired of beatin&#39; the fellas off with a stick.&quot;

&quot;You right about that,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;That&#39;s why I don&#39;t go out much. I&#39;m 
not interested in having a relationship but I can&#39;t go out and relax 
without every jackass in the place coming on to me.&quot;

&quot;Tell you what Lieutenant,&quot; the older non-com that had told the story 
said. &quot;You don&#39;t have to worry about that tonight. You heard the Dragon 
Lady, you jarheads! She wants a nice relaxing evening out and doesn&#39;t 
want to be bothered.&quot; Ranma grinned as the Marines effectively set up a 
perimeter around her and Claudia.

Ranma was surprised to find herself having a great time partying with 
Claudia and the 5-42nd Marines. All the guys respected her boundaries 
and none of them came on to her. She&#39;d even seen them turn away more 
than a few guys headed in her direction. Her drink was never dry and the 
stories were interesting. Ranma was almost able to forget her guilt over 
what she felt to be the basic deception of her life.

(oO\O/Oo)

It was in the small hours of the morning when a pasted Ranma and a less 
pasted Claudia sat in the car in front of Ranma&#39;s barracks.

&quot;Ranma?&quot; Claudia asked. &quot;How come you weren&#39;t interested in Lt. Newton? 
He was very cute and seemed to be a very nice guy.&quot;

&quot;Doan like guys like tha,&quot; Ranma slurred.

&quot;So you like girls?&quot; Claudia asked. &quot;You&#39;re a lesbian?&quot; Ranma fixed her 
with a bleary look for a minute as if thinking of something. She seemed 
to come to a decision.

&quot;&#39;S&#39;not whatcha think,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;What is it then?&quot; Claudia asked. &quot;I don&#39;t mind if you like girls. I 
consider you my friend and your sexual preference won&#39;t change that.&quot;

&quot;Ya really wanna know my dirty little secret?&quot; Ranma asked still fixing 
Claudia with that intent, slightly weaving stare that only someone who 
is very drunk is capable of. &quot;You gotta promise never to tell a soul.&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Claudia said. &quot;I promise it stays between you and me.&quot; Ranma 
gave an exaggerated drunken nod.

&quot;&#39;M a guy,&quot; Ranma said. Claudia blinked at her for a second then they 
both burst into laughter.

&quot;That was a good one, Ranma,&quot; Claudia gasped as she regained control of 
herself.

&quot;I&#39;m serious,&quot; Ranma said through her diminishing bouts of laughter.

&quot;Oh please,&quot; Claudia grinned. &quot;There&#39;s no way that body of yours is 
male.&quot;

&quot;S&#39;magic, Claudia,&quot; Ranma said seriously. &quot;S&#39;ancient Chinese curse. I&#39;s 
born a guy. Lived the first shixteen years of my life a guy &#39;til my 
idiot pop dragged me ta China.&quot; She saw Claudia looking at her like she 
has lost it. &quot;I can prove it.&quot;

&quot;Okay, Ranma,&quot; Claudia smirked. &quot;This I gotta see.&quot;

&quot;Not here,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Need really hot water. Come up to my quarters 
and I&#39;ll show you.&quot;

&quot;Why, Lieutenant, this isn&#39;t just a big scheme to get me into your room 
is it?&quot; Claudia grinned. Ranma rolled her eyes.

&quot;D&#39;ya want shee or not?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Okay, okay, I was just teasing,&quot; Claudia laughed.

The two women went up to Ranma&#39;s room where the redhead filled a tea 
kettle with water and placed in on a hot plate. She then disappeared 
into her bathroom and returned several minutes later wearing a large 
fluffy bathrobe and apparently nothing else. As the kettle heated up, 
Ranma spoke.

&quot;Now you gotta watch closhly the firsht time cause this s&#39;gonna hurt 
like hell s&#39;I don&#39;t want to do it more than onsh,&quot; the redhead said.

She opened the top of her robe, exposing her breasts and picked up the 
kettle that had just started to whistle. Claudia gasped as the girl 
dumped the scalding hot water over her head, gritting her teeth to keep 
from crying out.

&quot;What the hell?&quot; Claudia breathed as now where the petite young woman 
had stood, there was a gorgeous black haired hunk. His sculpted chest 
rippled with muscle as did everywhere she could see that wasn&#39;t covered 
by the now tight fitting robe. &quot;How is that possible?&quot; she asked in 
wonder.

The sun had been up for quite some time when Ranma finished her tale. 
She had returned to being female so that they didn&#39;t get into trouble 
for having a guy in the female BOQ. In the end, Claudia felt sympathy 
for her friend. She agreed to back off on pushing Ranma to date but she 
didn&#39;t relent on getting the redhead out more. She did assure Ranma that 
she remained her friend, much to Ranma&#39;s relief.

And so it was that Ranma added a third name to her list of true friends.

(oO\O/Oo)

June 2008...

Ranma was brought back to the present by someone snatching her up in a 
tight hug and twirling her around like a rag doll.

&quot;Ranma! It&#39;s so good to see you again!&quot; Claudia Grant exclaimed 
excitedly. &quot;It&#39;s been a long time!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s good to see you too, Claudia,&quot; Ranma laughed as she hugged her 
friend back. &quot;Look at you! You look good and you&#39;re a Lieutenant 
Commander now!&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; Claudia said proudly. &quot;I&#39;m the Second Officer on the SDF-1. You 
look good to, GIRLfriend! Hey, did Roy mention I had a surprise for you? 
Guess who the XO is on the SDF-1?&quot; She turned Ranma around to face the 
person who had been standing quietly watching the reunion.

&quot;Lisa?&quot; Ranma said softly, taking a few steps forward. &quot;Oh my god, it&#39;s 
been so long. Oh Lisa...&quot; Ranma gathered the brunette in a hug. &quot;I was 
so sorry to hear about Karl.&quot;

&quot;Oh Ranma,&quot; Lisa said, suddenly clinging to Ranma as she dissolved into 
tears. &quot;I miss him so much. It&#39;s so good to see you.&quot; Ranma hugged the 
crying woman comfortingly, stroking her back.

&quot;I know, I know, Sugar,&quot; Ranma said soothingly, as her own tears fell. 
&quot;I do to. He was one of the three people I consider to be my closest 
friends.&quot;

Claudia watched as her two friends comforted each other. She couldn&#39;t 
help but smile. To her knowledge, this was the first time that Lisa had 
let her grief for Karl Riber show since they had heard what happened to 
Mars Base Sara. She was getting a glimpse of the rarely seen emotional 
side to Lisa Hayes. Claudia thanked the powers above that there was at 
least someone her cool professional colleague felt comfortable letting 
her walls down in front of.

&quot;God it&#39;s good to see you again, Lisa,&quot; Ranma said as they separated. &quot;I 
missed you. How have you been?&quot;

&quot;I missed you too, Ranma,&quot; Lisa replied. &quot;I&#39;ve been okay. Just taking 
things one day at a time, losing myself in my work. How about you?&quot;

&quot;The same, I guess,&quot; Ranma smiled. &quot;I guess it&#39;s paying off for you. You 
made Commander and you&#146;re the XO of the SDF-1? Congratulations. Wow, how 
lucky is that? I get to serve with my two closest friends!&quot; Lisa giggled 
in spite of herself.

After a quick detour to Ranma&#39;s suite to repair the running mascara and 
damaged makeup, Ranma found herself in the company of her two friends 
plus one Roy Fokker at a Chinese restaurant called the White Dragon. 
Over dinner, Lisa and Ranma caught each other up on their lives since 
the Academy. Ranma and Roy swapped a few flying stories while Claudia 
told Lisa and Roy about her time with Ranma trying to pry her out of her 
shell.

After dinner, Roy took them to a nightclub for a few drinks. The blond 
man smirked at the jealous looks he was getting from the other guys.

&quot;What are you smirking about, Roy?&quot; Claudia asked cheerfully.

&quot;Oh not much, just that I&#39;m the envy of the room, accompanying three 
such beautiful women as you three,&quot; Roy said smoothly. Claudia laughed 
merrily while Lisa blushed shyly. Ranma just rolled her eyes.

It was at that point the waitress arrived and placed a drink in front of 
Ranma beside her half finished one. Ranma looked at her in question.

&quot;It&#39;s from the gentlemen at that table over there,&quot; the waitress pointed 
out. &quot;They also said they would be paying your tab for the night.&quot;

Ranma looked annoyed as she sought out the table in question, but the 
look soon cleared as she recognized some of the marines from the Vortex 
and later outings with Claudia. She smiled and waved to them. They waved 
back.

&quot;Give the gentlemen my thanks,&quot; Ranma smiled to the waitress.

&quot;What was that all about?&quot; Lisa asked.

&quot;Our little Ranma here has a fan club,&quot; Claudia giggled. &quot;Seems there&#39;s 
a few marines out there that have adopted her as their guardian angel 
after she saved them from being overrun. She&#39;s not allowed to pay for 
anything when there are marines around.&quot;

Lisa and Roy laughed while Ranma just smiled and shrugged.

&quot;I gotta use the head,&quot; Ranma said a while later.

&quot;I&#39;ll go with,&quot; Claudia agreed.

The two women got up and headed toward the ladies room. After using the 
facilities they stood before the mirror freshening up their makeup.

&quot;So does Lisa know?&quot; Claudia asked causally. Ranma could tell be her 
emphasis what Claudia meant.

&quot;Yeah, so did Karl,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;I think we should tell Roy,&quot; Claudia suggested. &quot;He can handle it and 
you can trust him.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, Claudia,&quot; Ranma replied. &quot;The more people that know, the 
more likely it will be to get out.&quot;

&quot;I know, but Roy can keep his mouth shut,&quot; Claudia assured her. &quot;Think 
of it as expanding your circle of close friends. He might just be able 
to help you out if it ever does come out. But he has to know before 
hand.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll think about it, okay?&quot; Ranma conceded.

&quot;Good girl,&quot; Claudia smiled. &quot;If you decide not to tell him, I&#39;ll 
respect that, but I think it&#39;s a good idea.&quot; With that they left the 
ladies room.

Ranma was weaving through the crowd behind Claudia when she felt a hand 
on her arm stop her.

&quot;Now why is a pretty little thing like you running around pretending to 
be a soldier,&quot; a large man asked. His buddies all laughed. &quot;A girl like 
you should be at home, safe and protected with a man to provide for her 
every whim.&quot; Ranma looked down at the hand still on her arm as if it 
were dog feces.

&quot;Remove your hand from my arm,&quot; Ranma said through gritted teeth, 
&quot;before you find out just how much pretending I&#39;m doing.&quot;

&quot;OOO, a sassy one,&quot; the man said in mock fear. His cronies chuckled. &quot;I 
don&#39;t think so little one. Not until you tell me your name and agree to 
dance with me.&quot; Ranma closed her eyes and took a breath, thinking about 
how much pain she wanted to cause this idiot versus how much trouble she 
was willing to get into because of it.

&quot;Wrong answer, Scumbag,&quot; another male voice said from behind Ranma. She 
looked over her shoulder and saw about five large marines standing there 
looking very menacing.

&quot;Sergeant, I can handle this jackass,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;I&#39;m well aware of that, Ma&#39;am,&quot; the sergeant grinned nastily. &quot;I&#39;ve 
sparred with you before. We just don&#39;t want you to have to get your 
hands dirty taking out this trash.&quot; Ranma thought for a second and 
nodded. The noncom&#39;s grin broadened and became more threatening as he 
continued &quot;As for you, knucklehead, you had best take your meat hooks 
off the Lieutenant if you know what&#39;s good for you.&quot;

&quot;Oh and I guess you think you can make me, huh?&quot; the man retorted and 
his cronies stood preparing to fight.

&quot;Damn right,&quot; the noncom said reaching out and grabbing the wrist of the 
hand that was on Ranma. The man holding her howled in pain as the 
Sergeant&#39;s grip became crushing, grinding the bones of the man&#39;s wrist 
together. Ranma&#39;s arm was released and the sergeant said to her, &quot;You go 
on and enjoy your evening, Ma&#39;am. We&#39;ll take care of this filth for 
you.&quot;

&quot;I appreciate that, Sergeant,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I really didn&#39;t want to get 
thrown in the brig for putting a civilian in the hospital on my first 
day on the island.&quot;

&quot;Our pleasure, Ma&#39;am,&quot; the marine grinned, still grinding the ruffian&#39;s 
wrist in his grip. &quot;Any time.&quot; Ranma walked away as the brawl broke out.

&quot;Ranma, what are you doing?&quot; Lisa demanded. &quot;We&#39;ve got to stop this 
fight!&quot;

&quot;Ah, let&#39;em have their fun, Lisa,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;They&#39;re defending my 
honor against some jackass and his crew that tried to force themselves 
on me. Besides, they&#39;ll go easier on the prick than I would have.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s right, Lisa,&quot; Roy said. &quot;It&#39;s best just to let them get it out of 
their system. At least it&#39;s for a good cause rather than them just 
picking a fight with the sailors like normal.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;So why do you all want to go over to my place?&quot; Roy asked again as he 
pulled into the parking garage of his apartment building.

&quot;Because you are the only one with an apartment,&quot; Claudia explained 
patiently...again. &quot;And you aren&#39;t allowed passed the lobby where we 
live.&quot;

&quot;I know that, but why do I need to be there?&quot; Roy asked, exasperated 
with how mysterious these women were acting.

&quot;You&#39;ll find out soon enough,&quot; Claudia grinned as Roy parked the 
vehicle.

Nothing more was said as the three women followed Roy up to his 
apartment. He was perplexed when Claudia instructed him to put a pot of 
water on the stove and bring it to a boil. While Roy was doing that, 
Claudia showed Ranma to the bathroom and snagged one of Roy&#39;s bathrobes 
for the redhead while she undressed. When Roy returned to the living 
room with a pot of water, he was surprised to find Ranma, naked except 
for one of his robes sitting on the couch between Claudia and Lisa.

&quot;Set the pot on the table and sit,&quot; Claudia said to him. Roy complied, 
getting more confused by the minute. &quot;Now, Roy, do you believe in 
magic?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; he asked.

&quot;It&#39;s a simple question, Roy,&quot; Claudia teased. &quot;Yes or no, do you 
believe in magic?&quot;

&quot;I think there are things in the universe we can&#39;t explain yet, but I&#39;d 
have to say, no, I don&#39;t believe in magic,&quot; Roy answered.

&quot;Well, prepared to have your perspective shifted,&quot; Lisa grinned.

&quot;You see, sir, I&#39;m cursed,&quot; Ranma began. &quot;This isn&#39;t the body I was born 
in. I&#39;m really a guy.&quot; Roy looked at her like she was nuts, but Ranma 
continued to explain about Jusenkyo and her decision to live in cursed 
form. She finished up and said to Claudia and Lisa, &quot;You guys got to see 
the whole change, but I ain&#39;t showin&#39; him my breasts or nothin&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Of course not,&quot; Claudia agreed. Ranma nodded.

&quot;Now watch close, Sir, because I&#39;m only doin&#39; this once. The water burns 
like hell,&quot; Ranma said.

Roy nodded, sitting forward with interest. He would normally think this 
was all a big joke, but Claudia and Lisa seemed to believe it, so he 
wasn&#39;t ready to discount it. Ranma took the pot of nearly boiling water 
and dumped it on her head, a small whimper escaping her as she was 
scalded.

Roy&#39;s jaw fell open as Ranma&#39;s form seemed to flow and expand. Before 
him where the redhead was sitting was a very well built black haired 
man. Roy was shocked speechless for several minutes.

&quot;I never thought I&#39;d see the day when Roy Fokker didn&#39;t have anything to 
say,&quot; Claudia laughed cheerfully.

&quot;You think we broke him?&quot; Ranma said in his male baritone.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, maybe,&quot; Lisa said, waving her hand in front of Roy&#39;s face 
then snapping her fingers. That brought him out of it...sort of.

&quot;I...what...who...&quot; the blond man stammered.

&quot;It&#39;s magic, Roy,&quot; Claudia smirked.

&quot;That&#39;s incredible,&quot; Roy said, finally putting together a coherent 
sentence. &quot;And you say you were born a male?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sir, I was, and I was one for the first sixteen years of my life,&quot; 
Ranma confirmed.

&quot;How can you live like that?&quot; Roy asked. &quot;I mean doesn&#39;t it feel totally 
wrong?&quot;

&quot;At first, it was hard to deal with because consciously my mind was 
telling me that I was a guy, not a girl and it was wrong,&quot; Ranma 
explained. &quot;However, the scary part was that it didn&#39;t FEEL wrong. It 
didn&#39;t feel any different from my male body when I was female. I learned 
that the curse comes with a sort of buffer to keep the victim from going 
nuts. It provides all the instincts needed to use the body and help the 
person adjust.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t mess with the mind, but it helps not to have to fight the 
feeling of being in a strange body while your mind tries to make the 
adjustment. That was the hardest part. I had to fight all the ultra 
macho chauvinistic conditioning that my pop had beaten into me. If the 
body didn&#39;t feel so natural to me, I probably would have killed myself. 
Instead, I chose to not let this beat me.

&quot;It wasn&#39;t easy, mind you, but I adjusted to being female. Hell, I&#39;ve 
lived as a female so long now, I&#39;m a little uncomfortable in my male 
form. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d take a cure if one existed. The only down side 
is I feel a little like I&#39;m lying to people. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t have 
many friends. I feel a sense of guilt for hiding something from them. 
That&#39;s also why I could never be in a relationship. I&#39;m not into guys, 
even as a girl, and even if a girl was interested, I feel like she&#39;d be 
interested in something that&#39;s not totally the truth.&quot;

&quot;That must suck,&quot; Roy said.

&quot;Yeah, but I&#39;ve accepted it as my fate,&quot; Ranma sighed sadly. &quot;As the 
song goes, My prison is walking through this world all alone. At least I 
have my career. That gives me enough of a purpose to go on. I do still 
have my career, don&#39;t I, Sir?&quot;

&quot;Um, well, yeah, sure, why wouldn&#39;t you?&quot; Roy asked.

&quot;Because you know they would kick her out of the service if they knew 
about this,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;That or they&#39;d try to turn her into some sort 
of lab rat. Roy, you have to promise never to tell anyone about this. We 
talked her into telling you because we thought you needed to know in 
case it ever does come out. As her CO, you should be prepared for that.&quot;

&quot;And we thought she could use another friend she doesn&#39;t have to feel 
guilty around,&quot; Claudia added.

&quot;Alright,&quot; Roy said decisively. &quot;Your secret is safe with me, Ranma. But 
please, change back. You&#39;re giving me the willies.&quot; Roy grinned to take 
the sting out of his words.

&quot;Yeah, no kidding,&quot; Ranma laughed. &quot;Sitting around in a bathrobe between 
two beautiful women isn&#39;t doing much for my composure either.&quot; He got up 
and headed for the bathroom, not noticing both women staring at his 
body, in particular his butt.

&quot;Ahem,&quot; Roy cleared his throat. Lisa, blushing already from Ranma&#39;s 
compliment, turned an even darker shade of crimson while Claudia just 
smirked.

&quot;What, Roy? You&#146;re the only one allow to look?&quot; Claudia teased. &quot;I saw 
you checking her out a few times tonight. Besides, hunk or hottie, Ranma 
is totally gorgeous. Don&#39;t you agree, Lisa?&quot;

&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Lisa nodded distractedly, licking her lips, then realized what 
she just said. She wiped a little moisture off the corner of her mouth 
and began to stammer. &quot;I mean, I...uh...&quot; She stopped and blushed in 
embarrassment while Claudia and Roy laughed.
