<pre>There she goes
There she goes again
Racing through my brain
And I just can&#39;t contain
This feeling that remains

Nabiki paused as the blue-haired Amazon biked past on one of her
errands. For the briefest moment her mind was cleared of all the facts,
figures and secrets. All that remained was an admiration for the
strength and skill packed in Shampoo&#39;s frame. She didn&#39;t know why it
nearly ripped her to shreds everytime she saw the amazon recently, it
just did.

There she blows
There she blows again
Pulsing through my vein
And I just can&#39;t contain
This feeling that remains

&quot;Hey, Chief?&quot; Yuka asked, surprised when Nabiki suddenly stopped
talking. &quot;Nabiki?&quot;
&quot;Forget it, she&#39;s gone.&quot; Sayuri told her, pointing at the passing
Shampoo. The Amazon was off on a delivery for the Cat Cafe. Sayuri
briefly hoped that she wouldn&#39;t see them, otherwise the pair would be
off again and they&#39;d get no work done. Nabiki&#39;s henchwomen were more
sure of the situation than Nabiki herself, after all they were outside
the situation.

There she goes
There she goes again
Racing through my brain
And I just can&#39;t contain
This feeling that remains

Nabiki noticed with irritation that duck-form Mousse was flapping along
behind Shampoo. It wasn&#39;t jealousy though, no, it was irritation that
her plans were proceeding so slowly. She wasn&#39;t concerned at all that
Mousse would be Shampoo&#39;s next logical choice when Ranma finally
settled on Akane...if she corrected herself. Not &quot;when&quot;, &quot;if.&quot; &quot;When&quot;
meant that Shampoo would be devastated, and she couldn&#39;t bare that. She
would make sure Shampoo was happy, and she told herself it was only
because happy customers spend more.

There she goes
There she goes again
She calls my name
She pulls my train
No one else could heal my pain
And I just can&#39;t contain
This feeling that remains

For a moment Nabiki thought that Shampoo was just going to ride on by
without even noticing her, and for some reason this pained her beyond
anything else. The cold, logical part of her didn&#39;t think that would be
bad thing, the girl was becoming too much of distraction. Maybe she
should listen to the old ghoul, maybe she should stay away from
Shampoo. She could handle Shampoo&#39;s jobs through intermediates, she did
it all the time anyway.
She was beginning to feel her heart crack when Shampoo looked in her
direction and waved.
&quot;Aiya!!&quot; Shampoo shouted cheerfully. &quot;Shampoo talk to you after done
working?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, just come to the diner,&quot; Nabiki called back, standing up.
Shampoo nodded cheerfully and biked on down the road.

There she goes
There she goes again
Chasing down my lane
And I just can&#39;t contain
This feeling that remains

Nabiki sat down again, wondering at the strength of the feelings that
had overwhelmed her when the amazon had merely deigned to notice her.
She blushed faintly and considered it with her logical mind, and came
to a conclusion. A surprising conclusion that sent her into both the
pits of depression and the heights of ecstacy.
&quot;I love her,&quot; she thought to herself with bitter-sweet feeling.
&quot;Chief,&quot; Yuka said again, trying to attract her boss&#39;s attention now
that Shampoo was gone. &quot;We need to talk to you about the Kuno
situation.&quot;
&quot;Hmm? Oh, yes, of course,&quot; Nabiki was suddenly the cold and confident
information broker again. She buried her emotions, the hopelessness of
them, deep in her soul and went back to the facts that were her life.
