<a href="../ranma/ambush-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>(Update 2005: Sorry for any fans for holding onto this for around 10 
months but I just forgot to post this on my site and been too lazy when 
I did remember.  Anyways, enjoy this chapter as it couldbe the last but 
hey, it might not if my interest in Ranma 1/2 returns...)
 
A long sigh.
 
&quot;Now don&#39;t say you&#39;re unhappy about coming here, Akane-chan.&quot;
 
Nabiki Tendou watched her younger sister as they both relaxed in the 
warm water of the Local Bathhouse.  Though the middle-sister would use 
that term loosely as she saw the frown on the other girl&#39;s face.
 
&quot;You know I wasn&#39;t in the mood in coming here, Nabiki.&quot; The younger girl 
grumbled, &quot;I&#39;ll rather be at house then sitting around here just waiting 
for that old pervert to come here again and wreck the place.&quot;
 
&quot;Well I thought it might be good to come since if you don&#39;t, Happosai 
probably would blow the top off this place again and you&#39;ll need to wait 
months again to visit.&quot; Then the moneylender smirked.
 
&quot;And besides, you can freely relax here and enjoy the wonderful view 
that all these young ladies give.&quot;
 
&quot;Hey!&quot; Akane slapped her sister&#39;s bare shoulder in annoyance, &quot;that&#39;s 
not funny you know.&quot;
 
&quot;You are so easy to tease at times, sis, I don&#39;t even need to use any 
effort anymore.&quot; Then her eyes slightly widened in surprise.
 
&quot;Sneaky-girl right, Shampoo think it too, too easy to tease 
scarlet-girl.&quot; A familiar voice added, startling the two Tendou sisters.
 
&quot;Shampoo!&quot; Akane&#39;s whole body went into a small panic attack as she 
whipped her head around to see a very familiar face framed with exotic 
purple hair.
 
&quot;Gees Akane, the way you react,&quot; Nabiki rolled her eyes, hiding her 
surprise a lot better then her sister, &quot;you&#39;ll think that Shampoo here 
was related to that nutball Kodachi or something.&quot;
 
The Amazon looked at the two girls with an amused expression on her 
features, while looked them up and down in a way Nabiki did not like 
overly well.
 
&quot;Sorry girl, but I&#39;m not for sale no matter what you offer me.&quot; The 
older girl said dryly, &quot;though I think I can get you a good offer for my 
baby sister here.&quot;
 
&quot;Hey! That&#39;s not funny!&quot;
 
&quot;Who says?&quot;
 
&quot;Aiyaah, you two are too, too silly.&quot;
 
&quot;Maybe but I&#39;m curious to know why you&#39;ll here.&quot; Nabiki turned her 
attention again back to the Amazon, while looking over the shapely 
figure the girl was gilfted with.
 
&quot;Why need reason to visit bathhouse?&quot; asked the Amazon girl, &quot;Shampoo 
have day off even on busy days like Saturday.&quot;
 
Akane was mostly quiet as she eyed the Amazon with suspicion look and 
mumbled to herself about &#39;Chinese Amazon stalkers&#39;.
 
&quot;Well,&quot; Akane finally grumbled out, &quot;as long as you don&#39;t annoy me 
today, I really don&#39;t care what you do.&quot;
 
&quot;What Akane problem?&quot; The Amazon asked, &quot;you in bad, bad mood today?&quot;
 
&quot;Oh don&#39;t mind her, she&#39;ll calm down once she stops thinking about the 
boys.&quot;
 
&quot;Boys?&quot; Shampoo blinked.
 
&quot;RANMA!!! I&#39;M GOING TO KILL YOU FOR THAT!&quot;
 
&quot;Oh.&quot;
 
&quot;Stupid Ranma,&quot; muttered Akane, as she glanced at the partition that 
separated the women&#39;s side from the men&#39;s, &quot;He&#39;s been teasing Ryouga all 
day since he came by this morning.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh little sister, what do you expect with those two?&quot; Nabiki shook her 
head in amusement as she heard the fighting start up once again, &quot;they 
act like brothers in a sense, always bickering and fighting, but in 
Ryouga&#39;s case he really does want to kill Saotome.&quot;
 
&quot;Whatever,&quot; Akane grunted out, &quot;If he doesn&#39;t cut it out soon I&#39;m going 
to flatten him before dinner time.&quot;
 
Silence soon fell over the three young women as they rested in the 
heated water while watching the going ons around them.  Some minutes 
later it was Nabiki who was the one to break the silence as she 
recognised some girls waiting near the changing rooms.
 
&quot;Sorry girls, but playtime for me is over.&quot; She started to move to the 
edge while looking back at the two girls who made a very an odd pair, 
&quot;so behave yourselves and try not to get to friendly with each other 
while in public.&quot;
 
In return to that, Akane only glared while Shampoo waved while saying 
with a straight face, &quot;Shampoo try but no can promise.&quot;
 
&quot;Shut up, Shampoo... dumb horny Amazon.&quot;
 
Nabiki chuckled to herself as she left the water while grabbing a nearby 
towel.
 
&quot;Its going to be interesting to see what comes out of this day.&quot; She 
murmurs to herself as she joined some business friends of hers.
 
Meanwhile back with Akane...
 
&quot;So now what?&quot; The short-haired girl finally grumbled out, &quot;I&#39;m guessing 
you&#39;re going to try something right here in front of everyone, Mmm?&quot;
 
Shampoo turned her head to the side and gazed at the other girl with a 
curious expression on her face.
 
&quot;Why do that, Akane?&quot; The Amazon replied, while playing with her long 
strands of purple hair.
 
&quot;Oh come on, I know you well enough that you&#39;ll do just about anything 
from anywhere to get what you want.&quot; She eyed the Amazon carefully, 
watching for any sudden hand movements towards her.
 
&quot;Akane is too, too silly,&quot; Shampoo smirked at the other girl, &quot;you think 
you center of world? Shampoo no think so.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh yeah? So why are you here?&quot;
 
&quot;No reason.&quot; The Amazon chuckled lightly.
 
&quot;Hmph, whatever.&quot; Once more silence fell over them.
 
Looking around, Akane tried not to notice what the Amazon was doing as 
she searched for any ofher friends who might had come today.
 
&quot;You should relax, Akane,&quot; Shampoo commented, as she closed her eyes 
while display a rare state of calmness, &quot;no need to act crazy on 
Shampoo, only want to spend time in private place for womens.&quot;
 
Akane glanced briefly at the girl soaking in the water beside her and 
wondered again what was going through the Amazon&#39;s mind.  She was still 
trying to gather enough information to understand why the latest events 
between them were happening.
 
&quot;Why can&#39;t my life ever be normal...&quot; Muttered Akane as she finally were 
able to calm her mind enough to ignore the display that Shampoo was 
giving her.
 
&quot;That no fun.&quot;
 
&quot;Maybe not to you, furball.&quot; Akane sighed, now staring at the roof as 
she heard more shouts and threats from Ranma and Ryouga.
 
The pair stayed like that, both silent and enjoying the warm water 
soothing their bodies.  If anyone knew the two girls, they would be 
surprised to see them together without arguing or fighting over 
something.
 
&quot;So...&quot; Akane finally said, tilting her head to the side to look at the 
peaceful expression on the Amazon&#39;s face, &quot;you decided yet when you&#39;ll 
going to seduce me again?&quot;
 
Shampoo only laughed lightly at that, hearing the way Akane&#39;s tone of 
voice made the question sound like a everyday normal inquiry.
 
&quot;Shampoo no sure,&quot; she opened one eye to look at the other girl, &quot;could 
be in five minutes or 5 days, no sure yet.&quot;
 
&quot;Hmph, with what&#39;s been going on in the last few weeks probably in the 
next 5 seconds.&quot; Akane shook her head in amazement, not believing they 
were discussing their next &#39;session&#39; in a calm fashion.
 
&quot;No rush Shampoo.&quot;
 
&quot;And I thought you were one of those impulsive types.&quot; Akane said dryly.
 
&quot;Aiyaah, no think Akane need it that bad.&quot; The Amazon smirked.
 
&quot;You wish, furball.&quot;
 
Before Shampoo could throw another comment at the short-haired girl, a 
loud explosion was heard from the other side of the partition.
 
&quot;Aiyaah!&quot;
 
&quot;Huh?!?&quot;
 
Both girls quickly turned to look around as sounds of a shuggle could be 
heard.
 
&quot;HEY! What are YOU doing here!!!&quot;
 
&quot;ACK! Stop him before he-&quot;
 
&quot;COME BACK HERE OLD MAN!&quot;
 
Shampoo and Akane blinked as two blurs shoot over their heads.  Turning 
around they both saw two very familiar forms in the water, one in a 
orange gi, small in size and known for its sins against women.  While 
the other was a very naked male, well built and currenly known for 
having dozens of girlfriends.
 
&quot;Get back here, you old coat!&quot; Ranma shouted as he ignored the panicking 
women around him, and continued to chase the elderly man around the 
women&#39;s side of the Bathhouse.
 
&quot;HA! Still too slow, M&#39;boy!&quot; Called back the Master of groping.
 
&quot;What the hell are those tow DOING!?&quot; Growled Akane, sitting in the 
water with her arms covering her breasts.
 
&quot;Chasing pervert master?&quot; replied Shampoo, who though not covering 
herself, was keeping an close eye on the old fossil.
 
&quot;I can SEE that!&quot; Akane snapped out, &quot;but could they do that somewhere 
ELSE?&quot;
 
Shampoo only shrugged, as she watched women flee into the change room 
though Shampoo knew better then that to go in there.
 
&quot;Akane-chan! Shampoo-chan!&quot; waved the old man, who zipped passed them on 
his way to where all the women went to escape.
 
Ranma by now, had noticed his fianc&eacute;es staring at him as he suddenly 
stopped before them.  Akane soon started to growl as she looked at the 
stun look on his face.
 
&quot;What are you looking at, you PERVERT!&quot;
 
&quot;Ack! I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry!&quot; The boy soon fleed from Akane and her 
flaring battle aura.  While Shampoo, who made sure to keep her breasts 
covered when the pervert master came by, studied the handsome boy before 
her with a hungry expression.
 
&quot;Stupid Ranma.&quot; Mumbled Akane, as she watched her perverted fianc&eacute;e dash 
into the women&#39;s changing room.
 
&quot;Silly Ranma.&quot; Shampoo shook her head in amusment.
 
But that wasn&#39;t the end of craziness as more shouts where soon heard 
from the men&#39;s side that made Shampoo cringe.
 
&quot;SHAMPOO! WHERE ARE YOU MY LOVE!&quot; Akane groaned as she realised it was 
going to be one of &#39;those&#39; days.  Looking at the Amazon beside her, 
Akane saw Shampoo shake her head in frustration.
 
&quot;Can Shampoo ever, EVER get a day away from stupid MOUSSE!&quot; growled the 
Amazon, while Akane shook her head as she thought briefly of her own 
problems with that baka Kuno.
 
&quot;In this town these days? you wish.&quot; Akane rolled her eyes as she heard 
the sound of Mousse throwing weapons at random.
 
&quot;I KNOW YOU&#39;LL HERE, SAOTOME, AND WITH THAT OLD PERVERT!&quot; The sound of 
something, many somethings, where hitting the partition.
 
&quot;Good thing the owners made the wall stronger with what happended last 
time.&quot; Noted Akane, while Shampoo only rolled her eyes as she listened 
to see if the Chinese boy was coming near or not.
 
&quot;Halt!&quot; Shouted yet ANOTHER familiar voice from the men&#39;s side of the 
bathhouse, which this time made Akane wince in pain, &quot;you FIEND!  How 
dare you go chasing after the foul Saotome when it should be I, The 
Blue-ack!&quot; The two girls felt like clapping at the interruption ot 
Kuno&#39;s speech.
 
&quot;Go away, you Noble nutcase.&quot; Growled back Mousse, &quot;You have no right to 
kill the scum that stole my Shampoo!&quot;
 
&quot;You dare, Chinese peasant?&quot;
 
&quot;I more then dare, fool! So take this!&quot;
 
It wasn&#39;t long til both girls realised that the two fools, err, Martial 
Artists had taken the battle outside.
 
&quot;Sometimes I think the gods above love making our lives into a 
neverending comedy show.&quot;
 
Shampoo just shook her head and glanced around to see that everyone on 
their side of the partition had left.  The Amazon couldn&#39;t blame the 
other girls, the old man was a true terror when it came to the fairer 
sex and Shampoo wondered again why her Great-Grandmother hadn&#39;t tried to 
kill the disgusting pervert.
 
&quot;Oh well,&quot; Akane sighed, &quot;that&#39;s the end of today&#39;s fun and games.&quot; She 
too looked around for a moment and realised that no-one was in sight but 
Shampoo.
 
&quot;Huh? Did he chased them all off again?&quot; Akane blinked, then looked to 
her side at the Amazon who in return looked back at her with a 
thoughtful look.
 
&quot;Ah...&quot; The girl shifted nervously in the water as she watched the 
Amazon girl eye her like tonight&#39;s dinner.
 
&quot;Shampoo think can answer Akane earlier question.&quot; The leer was so 
strong that Akane felt like covering up her breasts again.
 
&quot;I don&#39;t think-&quot;
 
&quot;No need to, for what Shampoo want to do.&quot;
 
Akane sighed as she realised that Shampoo once more was making another 
attempt at seducing her.  The feeling of fingers running up her thigh 
wasn&#39;t helping her resist the girl&#39;s advances too.
 
&quot;Why do you keep doing this?&quot; she murmured, now feeling both of 
Shampoo&#39;s hands rubbing up and down her thighs.
 
&quot;Who else Shampoo do to? No want be hit on head by Spatula-girl.&quot;
 
&quot;There is plenty of people Shampoo...&quot; groaned the girl, as the Amazon&#39;s 
fingers came closer to her dark flower.
 
&quot;Who then...?&quot;
 
Who? Indeed who? Akane&#39;s mind asked.  As she leaned back at the 
pleasurable actions of the Amazon&#39;s touch, Akane kept on asking that 
question.  Who would want to be with Shampoo this way? Not Ranma to 
Akane&#39;s knowledge since the boy mostly freaked just being hugged.  
Mousse, of course, but everyone knew that Shampoo viewed him like a pain 
in the ass.  Who else then? Akane knew that the other men that 
interacted with Akane had no interest in Shampoo and she right now knew 
no girls that liked the company of their fellow gender in a sexual 
manner.
 
Well mostly anyways, she wasn&#39;t sure about Nabiki&#39;s tastes...
 
So did Shampoo have anyone to turn to for company...?
 
&quot;That&#39;s why,&quot; muttered the girl, pushing the Amazon&#39;s advances away with 
great effect, &quot;why didn&#39;t I think of it sooner.&quot;
 
Surprised by the action, Shampoo was confused what the other girl was 
mumbling about.
 
&quot;Shampoo not know what you mean.&quot; The Amazon moved away on reflex, not 
liking the look in Akane&#39;s eyes.
 
&quot;Maybe, maybe not.&quot; The girl straightened up, &quot;but I think I know why 
you&#39;ll been acting the way you have.&quot;
 
&quot;Ah..yah?&quot;
 
&quot;Your lonely, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Akane asked, staring at the purple-haried 
girl hard, seeming to stare into the girl&#39;s very soul.
 
&quot;What Akane talking about,&quot; Shampoo shook her head, &quot;that funny talk.&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t think so!&quot; The youngest Tendou sister nearly growled out, &quot;I 
know what people think of you around here, most of the girls in my 
school are afraid of you!&quot;
 
Shampoo just shook her head again, confused at the sudden rush of 
strange emotions.
 
&quot;You know Ranma doesn&#39;t like you, even if you&#39;re more beautiful then me, 
Ukyo or even Kodachi.&quot; She watched the Amazon face go through multitude 
of emotions.
 
&quot;You wrong!&quot; The Amazon finally snapped out, &quot;Shampoo no need ANYONE! 
Only Airen, he husband.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh really?&quot; snorted Akane, &quot;not unless he accepts the title I think, 
and from you recent actions with me it seems ranma rejections are 
finally taking a toll on you personally.&quot;
 
&quot;No, no!&quot; Shampoo moved more away from Akane, but Akane moved forward to 
keep a close distance.
 
&quot;Oh yes, furball, that&#39;s why you can&#39;t stop yourself now,&quot; Akane&#39;s voice 
softened somewhat, &quot;I know you have no friends here and what we shared 
in my room made you think you could find some joy with someone who 
didn&#39;t reject your advances.&quot;
 
&quot;But Shampoo...&quot; Akane was surprised to see the beginnings of... 
tears... in the other girl&#39;s eyes.  Seeing that she had ripped through 
Shampoo&#39;s emotional defences, Akane moved forward to grasped the 
Amazon&#39;s shoulders.
 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry if I upset you,&quot; it was weird the way the situation was 
going, her of all people trying to comfort the strong and proudful 
Chinese Amazon Champion, &quot;but I think its time to drop this act of 
yours...&quot;
 
Silence was her reply for some moments, as the Amazon seemed to try and 
push back the unwanted feelings inside her.
 
&quot;We may have had a very rocky past but I&#39;m not a cruel person, Shampoo,&quot; 
she brushed Shampoo&#39;s flushed cheek with a finger, &quot;if you really wanted 
to changes between us, you should have asked.&quot;
 
&quot;But you no-&quot;
 
&quot;Maybe, but asking doesn&#39;t hurt, and besides,&quot; she couldn&#39;t help smirk 
at the exotic beauty, &quot;we Japanese don&#39;t bite...much.&quot;  And so Akane 
moved her head forward to the Amazon&#39;s neck and started to leave little 
kisses.
 
&quot;Aiyaah...&quot; Shampoo closed her eyes at the sensations of Akane&#39;s lips 
made.
 
&quot;So you think its time we made this litte affair of ours a more of a 
partnership then just jump and screw?&quot; Her lips had made their way to 
the Amazon&#39;s ear, as she whisper that question.
 
&quot;Ahh...Shampoo think...&quot;
 
&quot;No thinking is needed, as you would say.&quot; Akane chuckled lightly, 
seeing that for a change she was in control, &quot;but I think I&#39;m not ready 
for doing anything too daring here, so lets find a more private place to 
show that I do have a heart and don&#39;t mind sharing my time with you, 
Mmm?&quot;
 
Standing up, while bringing the somewhat confused though more emotional 
stable Amazon to her feet, Akane led the pair to the changing room in 
search of a more quite place to show her desires to the purple-haired 
furrball.
 
Unnoticed by the two young girls, on top of the partition that separated 
the two sides laid a small black figure.  And for some odd reason blood 
was leaking from its nose.
 
&quot;Beww...&quot; moaned the small piglet.
 
* * * * *
 
Some days later...
 
&quot;Well I guess this is one way to celebrate a month of this crazy 
relationship of ours.&quot; Murmured Akane to her partner.
 
&quot;Time fly when having fun, yes?&quot;
 
&quot;Must be flying pretty fast right now for you, furball.&quot;
 
Laying on Akane&#39;s bed facing upwards with legs spread, Shampoo moaned as 
she felt Akane&#39;s lips teasing the skin of her inner thighs.  The 
short-haired girl had coaxed the Amazon today to let her be in the 
driver&#39;s seat of their &#39;session&#39;.  So with no-one home, and not 
expecting anyone for another hour or so Akane had phoned Shampoo up to 
come over.
 
Not surprisely, the Amazon had arrived in minutes and proving once more 
that the girl was the officially the sex kitten of Nerima.  Currently 
the Tendou girl was positioned between the Amazon&#39;s legs while with 
great slowness she used her mouth to bring off the purple-haired 
bombshell.
 
&quot;Mmmm...that nice...&quot; Shampoo let out a long sigh, enjoying the 
attention she was receiving below while she played with her harden 
nipples, &quot;must get Akane do more, more offen.&quot;
 
The other girl didn&#39;t reply but the pace quickly picked up as Shampoo 
found herself moaning up a storm as Akane attacked her lower regions 
with a fierce drive.
 
Being much more experienced now, Akane was able to bring the Amazon off 
without difficultly.  So the Amazon girl rode with the orgasmic wave of 
pleasure, as Akane watched with a smirk as she thought up other ways to 
make this afternoon of games interesting.
 
Seeing that Shampoo had regained her bearings mostly, Akane patted the 
girl&#39;s thigh while she commanded the Amazon, &quot;Well I hope that was nice, 
furball, but I think I need a bit of that in return so for 
starters...would you please start purring like a cat for me.&quot;
 
Shampoo blinked at the girl, not expecting that demand so she just 
looked back at Akane with a raised eyebrow.
 
&quot;Come now, that&#39;s not to hard to do?&quot; Akane leaned over and grasped 
Shampoo&#39;s shoulders, &quot;and please meow as well, I can&#39;t have my furball 
not sounding like my Amazon pussy-cat.&quot;
 
Starting to understand where Akane was going with this, she let the girl 
pull her to a sitting position while she started to emit a purr sound 
from her throat.
 
&quot;Ahh, that&#39;s better...&quot; Akane nodded as she stroked the sides of 
Shampoo&#39;s impressive bosom, &quot;now if only my furball would say hello to 
her cute owner, I think then things can get moving again.&quot; The girl 
smiled as she heard the meow come from her Chinese partner.
 
&quot;So then my little pussy, why don&#39;t you start licking me, I sure need it 
after today.&quot; Shampoo nodded as she leaned over to start flicking her 
tongue over the harden nipple while keeping up her deep purr.
 
&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; sighed Akane, bracing her hands behind her to keep her 
balance as she bent her back in delight, &quot;more of that tittle kitty.&quot;
 
Shampoo by now had both of her hands busy.  One of them was teasing and 
tweaking Akane&#39;s free nipple while the other had moved down between the 
short-haired girl&#39;s legs with two fingers slowly thrusting into the 
girl&#39;s hot sex.
 
&quot;Ohhhh yeah...&quot; One thing she couldn&#39;t complain about Shampoo was that 
she always gave as good as she got.  Though the girl had hands that 
could crush rock no doubt, she could be very gentle when she wanted to 
be.  After the emotional encounter at the bathhouse, the two had finally 
sat down and talked about things, well mostly anyways as both girls 
couldn&#39;t help themselves in touching the other.
 
But in the end of that longer then usual session, a kind of 
understanding had grown between them that still made her shake her head 
in wonder.  Though both of them grew up with totally different lives, it 
seemed that they could interact with each other without coming to blows.  
And all it took to form this new odd friendship of sex and games was a 
spar of the moment impulse from Shampoo and Akane&#39;s submitting to the 
Amazon&#39;s advances.
 
Arching her back a bit more, the Tendou girl cooed out in pleasure as 
she felt that magic edge come closer.  The feel of the Amazon&#39;s teeth 
nipping and tugging at her hard nub, and the now fierce thrusting of 2 
long digits into her sopping wet sex was driving her to a strong orgasm.
 
&quot;Oooohhhh yeesSSSS!&quot; Akane nearly shouted out, as she collapse backwards 
as she felt the orgasm wash over her.
 
Shampoo, still purring, watched the Tendou girl sigh in pleasure as she 
licked her sticky fingers clean.  That had been an interesting idea of 
Akane&#39;s to have her act like a cat which in turn helped keep the sex fun 
and pleasurable.  Staring at the girl laying on the bed, Shampoo gained 
an idea of her own on what to do next.
 
Akane had only just regained her senses when Shampoo pounced on top of 
her.  The girl was even more surprised when the Amazon grasped her upper 
arms and leaned over.
 
&quot;What are...you...hey stop...that!&quot; Akane giggled a bit, as Shampoo 
licked her face while making meowing sounds, &quot;come on, you don&#39;t need to 
act like a...stop please!&quot;
 
Shampoo continued to lick the girl&#39;s face, enjoying herself as she made 
the girl squirm and laugh.  Shampoo didn&#39;t quite understand her own 
actions, but Great-Grandmother at times would remind her it was better 
to let go and live a little then act all serious all the time.
 
As the two girls continued to play, or torment if you asked the giggling 
Akane, both were so into the game that neither noticed the running 
footsteps until they froze at the sound of Akane&#39;s door sliding open...
 
...
 
&quot;...but its TRUE!&quot; shouted Ryouga, as he followed his arch-rival Ranma 
Saotome toward the Tendou Dojo.
 
&quot;Whatever man,&quot; snorted the other boy, &quot;but keep your perverse dreams to 
yourself if you don&#39;t might.&quot;
 
&quot;RANMA!&quot;
 
Sighing at the familiar signs of his old rival going postal again, Ranma 
jumped off the fence while he said, &quot;Cool off there P-chan, no need to 
go off your rocker like usual.&quot;
 
Receiving a glare in return, the Saotome heir shrugged as he wakled 
towards home, &quot;I had better things to do then walk you to the Dojo, 
Ryouga  so don&#39;t piss me off or I&#39;ll just leave you behind.&quot;
 
Shaking his head to try and clear it, the fanged boy stared hard at 
Ranma as he tried again to explain things.
 
&quot;I&#39;m not joking Ranma,&quot; he snarled out, &quot;Akane was doing what I said to 
Shampoo, my eyes don&#39;t lie.&quot;
 
&quot;And I don&#39;t believe you because that just plain crazy talk.&quot;
 
&quot;I KNOW WHAT I SAW!&quot;
 
&quot;Man you are overly high strung today.&quot; The pigtail boy noted, making 
sure he was walking at a safe distance from the other martial artist.
 
&quot;Fine! Then I&#39;ll just have to prove it to you!&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Ranma shook his head, &quot;you&#39;ll just pissed because Akane 
doesn&#39;t like you the way you do.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;ll show you.&quot; Ryouga muttered, as the Dojo came into view.
 
Ranma said nothing as they soon came up to the front door, though he 
silently grumbled to himself that he could be right now eating at 
Ucchan&#39;s.
 
 
End of Chatper 3.
 
 
Author notes:
          That&#39;s the 3rd one down, who knows how many to go.  Hope you 
liked that one since I wasn&#39;t completely happy with it.  So if you have 
any thoughts or suggestions, or see some small errors, email me.  As for 
Chapter 4 its going to be more limish then a lemon...
 
Nest time:
          Akane and Shampoo find themselves in hot water as Ranma tries 
to deal with the new situation and the feelings that comes with it.  
Meanwhile, Nabiki starts to find herself being drawn into the whole 
mess, even if she wants to or not.
