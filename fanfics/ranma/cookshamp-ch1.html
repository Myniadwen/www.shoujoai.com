<h1>Cookies from Shampoo</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shamie.html">Shamie-Chan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Shamie-Chan: Hello again XD This is my third fanfic and I&#146;m really 
excited about finally getting this one posted. I just want to say THANK 
YOU to the people who have reviewed my fics! It makes me so happy to 
know people are actually reading these things.

Deep Manly Voice: Am I on yet?

Shamie-Chan: Hold your horses! I also wanted to say that this fic isn&#146;t 
so much like my other fics. This is one of my more humorous fics&#133; I 
think it may be impossible for me to write fics without writing them 
with yuri and lemony goodness&#133; This fic was definitely a challenge to 
come up with. A BIG thank you Trix for the idea!

Deep Manly Voice: Ah-hem, Shamie-Chan does not own the characters of 
this story. She only owns the plot. The characters are based on the 
characters of Ranma &frac12; written by the glorious genius Rumiko Takahashi! 

PS I&#146;m not a really good situational writer so have mercy please o_o;;



~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~


Akane&#146;s feet were starting to hurt, her back was aching, she was as hot 
as hell and it wasn&#146;t as though the quick paced hike was getting any 
easier than when it had started two day before.

&#147;Ranma!&#148; She yelled out as she stopped hiking up the steep incline 
breathing heavily. &#147;Will you stop already?! Once I get to the top of 
this hill I&#146;m not going any further!&#148;

&#147;Oh come on! You&#146;re not tired already are ya?&#148; Ranma was suddenly 
standing in front of Akane, poking her lightly trying to get her mad 
enough to keep on moving.

Akane&#146;s face got red and she hit Ranma over the head with a mallet 
sending him hurtling up the hill. She trudged up after him and collapsed 
once she reached the top. Ranma stood over her, tilting his head to the 
side he asked, &#147;How `bout ya camp out hear for tonight?&#148; 

Akane&#146;s eyes shot open and she sat up straight. &#147;You&#146;re leaving me?&#148; Her 
eyes grew big as she looked up at him.

&#147;I&#146;ll be back here by tomorrow, I just need to finish this hike and 
you&#146;re only slowing me down. What&#146;s the mater? Are ya scared of being 
alone out here?&#148;

Akane glared back up at him, her temper rising, &#147;Of course I&#146;m not 
scared! You think because I&#146;m a girl means I don&#146;t know how to rough 
it?!&#148; She balled up her fists, stood up and got up on her tiptoes, 
trying to look Ranma in the eye.

&#147;Well, that&#146;s settled then!&#148; He turned and began walking again, &#147;This 
place&#146;ll be good for ya ta camp at. I&#146;ll be back tomorrow mornin`!&#148; 

Akane looked around her, noting the almost setting sun, a really big 
deep looking hot spring, trees and fallen dried up timber for firewood. 
She puffed out her chest and went to work on setting camp. &#145;Stupid 
Ranma, does he not care if I get abducted by some psycho person?&#146;

She grabbed a cooking knife and threw it at a tree, missed and watched 
it fly into the hot spring.

She squinted up her eyes, sighed and shrugged it off. She didn&#146;t want to 
go in the hot springs in fear of drowning in the deep water and went 
about setting up a fire. While placing a stick in the flames she jumped 
remembering something. &#147;Oh no! That stupid Ranma took the food with 
him!!!&#148; Her stomach growled right then and she slumped back wondering 
what to do.


~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~


Meanwhile at the top of the hill, an exhausted Shampoo collapsed to the 
ground carrying a heavy looking pack. She turned her head slightly to 
see the setting sun. She pouted her lips, wondering why she hadn&#146;t 
finally caught up to the Violent-Girl and her Airen yet.

She shrugged off her pack and sat down on it, that when she saw the fire 
up ahead. She unloaded the little food she had left, put her pack back 
on and bounded over to the campsite. When all she saw was Violent-Girl 
she stealthily hid behind the nearest boulder.

&#145;Where Shampoo&#146;s Airen?&#146; She looked around decided to observe 
Violent-Girl for a little longer before making her entrance.


~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~


&#147;Ranma! How could you take all the food with you!&#148; Akane began rummaging 
through her bag, looking for any small morsel of food she could find. 
Her stomach growled again and she fell backwards in dismay among the 
items she had carelessly thrown from her pack. &#147;Nothing!&#148;

&#147;Nihao Violent-Girl!&#148; Akane was about to sit up abruptly when she was 
pushed back and pinned by the Chinese Amazon.

&#147;Shampoo! What&#146;re you doing here?!&#148; Akane began to squirm and get 
angrier by the second. She was released and stood up looking around for 
the Amazon so she could kick her to Timbuktu but found her nowhere in 
site.

&#147;You let guard down too too much. I had teach lesson!&#148; Shampoo dangled 
upside down from a branch above Akane&#146;s head, dangling her food in front 
of Akane&#146;s face.

Akane jumped up and swung at Shampoo&#146;s head but she dodged it easily and 
perched herself on top of the branch effortlessly. &#147;Why we no make 
deal?&#148; Se watched as Akane began making her way clumsily up the tree 
trunk, inching towards Shampoo.

&#147;I&#146;m not going to make any deals with you, you little&#133;&#148; Akane suddenly 
lost balance, fell forward and wrapped her arms and legs around the 
branch.

Shampoo started laughing and flaunted the food in front of Akane again. 
&#147;Deal if Violent-Girl fall first, Violent-Girl tell Shampoo where Airen 
is.&#148;

Akane looked up and smirked but it soon went to alarm as she felt the 
wind move the branch slightly. &#147;That doesn&#146;t seem fair, what about if I 
win and you fall first?&#148; She stood up uneasily with her arms out to her 
sides.

&#147;Violent-Girl get food of course!&#148; Her eyes grew wide as she saw Akane 
dive towards her. She wasn&#146;t ready, was hit and both girls went crashing 
towards the hot spring.

&#147;You&#146;re going down!&#148; Akane grabbed hold of Shampoo and they both went 
hurtling into the hot spring. &#145;Oh no! I can&#146;t swim and this waters was 
deeper than I thought it was!&#146; Akane began madly thrashing in the water 
when she saw blood begin to swirl around her. Her eyes grew wide. The 
knife!

She looked down to see a wincing Shampoo holding her leg, trying 
uselessly to swim upwards. Akane was completely panic stricken by now. 
&#145;What do I do? What do I do?!&#146; She looked down to see that Shampoo had 
gained leverage on a jagged rock with her good leg and pushed up with 
what strength she had left, hitting Akane and sending them both to the 
surface.

Akane and Shampoo gasped for air and Akane grabbed the side of the Hot 
Spring and pulled herself out. She turned to see Shampoo floating 
unconscious and pulled her out as well. Once Shampoo hit dry land her 
eyes fluttered open and she cried out in agony, grasping her stabbed 
calve.

Akane inspected the wound and went to work bandaging it. She did so 
quietly, refusing to look Shampoo in the eye. She was embarrassed that 
she clumsily took both them down because she carelessly jumped at the 
other girl. She gave Shampoo some pain reliever (when traveling with 
Ranma, you&#146;re bound to need them sooner or later) and started boiling 
some water knowing it was best to clean the wound with warm water.

After laying out Shampoo&#146;s blankets and setting her on them she began 
rummaging through Shampoo&#146;s pack, looking to see if she had any food 
left over that wasn&#146;t floating in the hot spring. &#147;Ah-ha!&#148; She pulled 
out some cookies and started munching on some.

She cleaned Shampoo&#146;s wound, after doing so she gave Shampoo one. 
Shampoo swallowed and then awakened unexpectedly and winced in pain at 
the ache in her leg. &#147;What Shampoo eat just now?&#148; Her eyes were slightly 
large as she asked this question.

Akane had just finished re-bandaging Shampoo&#146;s leg and look at her face 
confused and embarrassed. &#147;I got it from your pack, it was all that was 
left to eat so I&#133;&#148; Her sentence trailed off when she saw Shampoo&#146;s jaw 
drop.

&#147;Shampoo, what did we just eat?&#148; She looked down at the bag 
suspiciously. She felt an urge take control of her all of a sudden. 
Looking at Shampoo wild eyed she was able to say in a very Kasumi like 
fashion, &#147;Oh my.&#148;

&#147;I brought for Ranma, they lust cookies.&#148; Shampoo chest heaved and she 
looked at Akane accusingly. &#147;Why you go in Shampoo pack! You no want 
know only way reverse symptoms!&#148;

Both girls eyes got wide as they looked at each other with a new 
understand of what was happening to them. Shampoo started to try to 
crawl away but Akane held the wincing girl down. Shampoo looked up at 
Akane slowly and shook her head trying to clear her thoughts, the bells 
in her hair jingling.

&#147;We have to&#133; yeah&#133;. To get rid of it don&#146;t we.&#148; Akane stated in an 
embarrassed manner. Shampoo nodded and Akane felt a new rush of heat 
take over her.

It was about an hour after sunset and the only light now was from the 
fire. Shampoo began squirming on her blankets, rubbing her legs together 
uncomfortable and Akane squeezed her together subconsciously.

&#145;I can&#146;t do it with a girl! Let alone Shampoo! Why am I getting all 
squishy down there?&#146; Akane&#146;s face turned beat red when she began feeling 
herself become increasingly wetter and wetter.

Akane looked over at Shampoo to see that she had pulled a blanket over 
her entire body, head and all and bent her good knee up. Akane heard a 
slight mewling and turned away knowing what Shampoo was doing.

&#145;Has she no dignity!?&#146; Unlike Shampoo, Akane had no idea what to do. 
Her&#133; area was starting to throb. She sat there watching the fire, trying 
not to think of what was happening to her body.

About a half hour later she was restless. Pacing, jumping up and down or 
practicing karate on a tree, it was all no good. Her body was making her 
become aware of things she never noticed before. Like how her shirt 
rubbed against her chest or how when she did a high kick it tightened 
just the right places.

Shampoo wasn&#146;t doing much better. By now she had the covers thrown off 
in the heat she was creating and was touching herself out in the open 
but to no avail. She was becoming more and more annoyed by the second, 
she knew she couldn&#146;t get off alone without someone else.

Shampoo sat up with tears in her eyes, frustrated by the situation. 
Knowing there was a slim to none chance that Akane would help her. She 
looked over at Akane, if she wasn&#146;t so horny she would have been 
laughing seeing how worked up Akane was fidgeting and moving around.

&#147;You know it useless, it no get normal until we do something.&#148; Shampoo 
tried her best to look seductive but soon figured she didn&#146;t have to. 
Akane jumped to Shampoo&#146;s side, then stood up in front of her, then 
began pacing around her making little squishing noises as she did so.

&#145;I won&#146;t! I won&#146;t! I won&#146;t! I won&#146;t lost my virginity to her! I won&#146;t! I 
won&#146;t!&#146; Shampoo suddenly understood why Akane was so nervous and giggled 
lightly. &#147;You technically no lose virginity till man put his self in 
you. This no count.&#148; Akane stopped pacing and looked at Shampoo 
mystified.

&#147;How did you know I was thinking that?&#148; Shampoo looked up at her almost 
annoyed, &#147;I no as stupid as people make me seem. I just bad at Japanese. 
You try learning language too too fast then we talk! Great-Grandmother 
use word for me&#133;. She say I,&#148; Shampoo thought for a moment, &#147;I 
s-s-straightforward.&#148; Shampoo smiled back up at a gawking Akane and ran 
her finger alone Akane&#146;s bare leg. &#147;Please?&#148;

Akane took off her shorts and panties and sat down next to Shampoo, 
giving in. &#147;Okay.&#148; Shampoo clapped her hands together happily. &#147;But I 
don&#146;t know what to do.&#148; Akane smiled uncomfortably and gasped when 
Shampoo carefully rolled Akane on top of her. Both girls&#146; faces were 
inches apart but they moved no closer, they didn&#146;t want to lose their 
first kisses to each other.

Shampoo pressed her good knee to Akane&#146;s heat and gave some pressure and 
Akane shivered all over. She leaned her head forward and laid it in 
Shampoo&#146;s hair, sighing. Carefully she lowered her knee to Shampoo&#146;s wet 
hot unclad mound. Both girls started to form a rhythm with each other as 
they both started moving against one another.

&#147;Nnn&#133; that it&#133; ahh&#133;just that way&#133;ohhh&#133;&#148; Shampoo&#146;s breathing was slowly 
becoming ragged. She wrapped her arms around Akane&#146;s waist, hugging her 
closer to herself.

Akane&#146;s eyes were screwed shut as she began breathing deep breaths, 
smelling Shampoo&#146;s sweet scent all around her. Her breasts pressing 
against Shampoo&#146;s and that was having a pleasurable effect to her 
sensitive nipples.

Where they were rubbing against each other and now it was becoming 
slippery but it wasn&#146;t enough to take them both over the edge. Shampoo 
knew this and pushed Akane back to a sitting position and pressed her 
pleasure spot against Akane&#146;s and started grinding her hips frantically.

Akane put her head on Shampoo&#146;s shoulder and moved with her. By know 
Akane was a mindless boggle. She had never even got off alone before, 
let alone grating her hips against another girl but it felt so good she 
couldn&#146;t stop now. Both girls suddenly felt their insides clench as both 
their orgasms hit them hard and fast.

Akane&#146;s eyes screwed shut again and she gasped out as she felt the heat 
and lust climb to new heights while Shampoo cried out and bucked trying 
to make the sensation last longer. After it was over both fell to the 
side, Shampoo wincing, and they lay like that as aftershocks flowed 
through their bodies.


*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*


The next morning Ranma walked back to the camp absolutely confused. 
First, he saw bloody bandages in a kettle of water over a burnt out 
fire. Second, Shampoo was there and third, Shampoo and Akane were 
sleeping right next to each other in their pajamas but with no blanket 
covering them to conceal how their hands were entwined together.

He scratched his head confused when he saw a bag of cookies lying on a 
rock. Being the true Saotome he was, he popped about five in his mouth, 
looked over at the two slumbering girls again and went to clean out the 
kettle and start a new fire.




THE END&#133; or is it? How about you use your imagination! {winks}

Shamie-Chan: I&#146;m evil! I know it! I love it! {hides from rampant 
readers} This is a story I&#146;m definitely going to consider making a 
second part to.

Ranma: {nosebleeds} WHAT?!?!?!

Akane: Shut up you big baby! If I can do it, you can do it too!

Shampoo: {glomps Ranma} Airen!

Shamie-Chan: I haven&#146;t written anything with guys yet but I know I can&#133; 
but I&#146;m ready to break from fanfic&#146;s for a while. I&#146;m going to be doing 
fanart next time I have an urge to do anything fanlike.
