<h1>Ambush 1/2 (part 4 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/koalakiller.html">KoalaKiller</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/ambush-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Walking at a brisk pace, Nabiki was heading home earlier today then she 
would normally would have.  Though her afternoon was usually booked with 
meetings with students from her old high-school, she had just received 
an important message.
 
The message basically had said that Ranma hadn&#39;t head off to Ucchan&#39;s 
and had been seen leading Ryouga to her home.  Though that in itself 
wouldn&#39;t worry her at all, it was the message before that one which 
informed her that Shampoo had dropped by the Dojo.
 
Shaking her head in frustration at the bad timing, the college student 
at times wondered why she had gotten involve in Akane&#39;s personal life in 
this fashion.
 
Sure at the beginning it give her a few extra yen notes that helped her 
out.  She had only been selling a few general pieces of information, 
advice and leaking a few times where Akane would be.  Heck, Shampoo 
could afford to buyt more information if she wished to if what the 
sketchy details Nabiki had on the Amazon&#39;s cash flow.  But it seemed the 
Chinese girl was smart enough on how much she needed to know.
 
So for the last month Shampoo had become a semi-regular client who paid 
on time and kept her little sister distracted.   As well Shampoo&#39;s 
attention helped Akane focus her anger into something else more 
pleasant.  At first she was hesitant in selling some of the info that 
the Amazon wanted but the memory of the glow around her sister that 
Saturday morning had made her decide to help out the purple-haired girl.
 
So she observed from a distance to see how the new situation would fan 
out.  She had noticed with each encounter the pair would have Akane 
seemed to be more calmer, not yelling as much at Ranma or suffer from 
jealous glances with the other rivals come by.
 
It was nice to see Akane acting somewhat more normal of late.  No doubt 
she wasn&#39;t feeling as frustrated as normal while learning to live with 
the other girls in Ranma&#39;s life.  Though Nabiki had been curious to see 
how Ranma would react to Akane&#39;s little fling with Shampoo, Nabiki knew 
Saotome&#39;s feelings towards Amazons and with what Cologne had put him 
through in the early days of the Elder&#39;s arrival...
 
As they say, first impressions are important and sadly things didn&#39;t 
work out well back then.  And now, with Shampoo taking a healthier 
interest in Akane for reasons she didn&#39;t even know, Ranma&#39;s reaction 
wouldn&#39;t be easy to gage but it sure wouldn&#39;t be a good one.
 
Letting out a sigh, Nabiki let her mind wander around.  She had found of 
late her own desires were stirring more then usual.  With the sexual 
nature of Akane&#39;s relationship with Shampoo, she had started having odd 
little dreams of herself in the bedsheets with curtain people.  It was 
shooking that her well trained mind could slip like this and let her 
imagine herself with people like Ranma, Shampoo and even once with 
Akane.
 
True she had these dreams before though not very offen, the latest ones 
had a more intense feel about them.  It was like there was an &#39;itch&#39; 
somewhere on her that she couldn&#39;t find and the only thing that would 
lessen it was thoughts of exploring her sexual nature.
 
She had recently started a little diary, writing in her thoughts on what 
she was feeling while jotting down questionable scenes with people she 
felt attracted to.  The latest scene she had wrote had contained herself 
with not only her baby sister but Ranma-kun and Shampoo all together in 
the kitchen doing the nasty while Kasumi made lunch ignoring what was 
going around her.
 
It did lessen her urges but it didn&#39;t help her gain control fully.  She 
had guessed she needed a boyfriend to distract herself but the young men 
around here knew better to trust her.
 
That thought made Nabiki briefly snort in laughter, As if she wanted 
their money that badly.
 
Anyways, who wanted to settle with some nobody here in Nerima?  The 
image of Ranma briefly passed through her mind but she shook that 
thought away since she liked her arms and legs in working condition.
 
As her home came into view, Nabiki just hoped nothing too bad had 
happened.  And if Ranma found out, well things around here will sure go 
straight to hell one way or another.
 
* * * * *
 
The short silence that followed the door sliding open was truly 
deafening in the room until the sound of something hitting the floor 
broke it.
 
Ranma finally blinked, a number of times, then...
 
&quot;NO Ranma, don&#39;t!&quot; Shouted Akane, seeing Ranma&#39;s facial expression.
 
The sight of her Airen lunging towards her in a very unfriendly manner 
made Shampoo catapult of the short-haired girl below her and landed on 
her butt on the other end of the bed, while moving her arms into a 
awkward defensive position.
 
This had made Ranma stop short as he seemed to be trying to figure out 
what was happening before him.  Akane had by now sat up, covering 
herself the best she could while using one of her infamous glares on her 
overprotective fianc&eacute;e.
 
&quot;What the HELL are you doing here, Ranma?&quot; She snapped out, &quot;and who 
gave you permission to enter my room?!&quot;
 
Ranma blinked as he still couldn&#39;t accept what he had seen.  He glanced 
briefly at the Amazon girl who was currently wearing a guarded look, 
then looked back at Akane while trying not to notice her current state 
of dress.
 
&quot;What am I doing?&quot; He said, surprised with the thickness in his voice, 
&quot;I should be the one asking that with what I just saw!&quot;
 
&quot;And what was that, Ranma?&quot; Shampoo asked quietly, looking at the boy 
with a odd expression on her face.
 
&quot;Well ...I... you where...?&quot; Ranma shook his head, &quot;I&#39;m starting to 
wonder what I saw now, but it sure didn&#39;t look right!&quot; He gave the 
Amazon a sharp look.
 
&quot;Its none of your business Ranma, &quot; Akane growled out, briefly looking 
at the Amazon wondering what was going through her mind, &quot;What I do in 
my spare time is my business, not yours.&quot;
 
&quot;What?&quot; Ranma blinked, &quot;only your business, but Shampoo was...&quot;
 
&quot;MY business, Ranma.&quot; Akane uncovered her breasts and waved a finger at 
the boy&#39;s flushed face, &quot;and if I want Shampoo in my room, I&#39;ll have her 
here!&quot;
 
&quot;But you two HATE each other!&quot; He blurted out, shaking his head in 
confusion and frustration as he tried to figure out what he saw and why 
Akane was acting the way she was.
 
&quot;Oh? When was the last time did I say I hated Shampoo.&quot; The short-haired 
girl asked, raising her eyebrows as she covered her breasts again.
 
&quot;But you two always have hated each other!&quot; Ranma snapped back with.
 
&quot;Hmph,&quot; Akane reposition herself so she could cover her lower regions 
better, &quot;True, in the past we didn&#39;t get along much.  But that was 
because of you.&quot;
 
&quot;Hey! Don&#39;t blame me for you hating people!  And Shampoo has done some 
pretty bad things in the past, if you haven&#39;t forgotten!&quot;
 
&quot;Oh sure she has,&quot; Akane then smiled, &quot;and I&#39;ll admit the stuff she 
pulled pissed me off more then often but if you think about it she 
hasn&#39;t done that much damage other then causing some holes in my home.&quot;
 
Ranma just stared at Akane&#39;s face in wonder and confusion, as he 
continued to try and wipe away the image of Shampoo hovering above 
Akane, the Amazon&#39;s face near the tomboy&#39;s while doing who knows what.
 
Then as Shampoo started to move forward, Ranma suddenly straightened up 
in shook as the scene he had witnessed became more clearer, showing once 
again that the Saotome heir at times was slow to the draw.
 
&quot;Wha.. What was Shampoo doing to your face?&quot; He blurted out, catching 
both girls by surprise with the question.
 
&quot;Huh? My face... &quot; Akane glanced at the Amazon who was studying Ranma 
with a thoughtful look.  But her attention snapped back to Ranma as the 
boy suddenly shot a arm out and brushed her cheek with a finger.
 
&quot;Wet? But then... &quot; He looked at the Amazon in wonder, as possibilities 
started to form in his head, ones that even surprised him.
 
Seeing the look in the boy&#39;s eyes, Shampoo sighed as she gathered that 
Ranma was starting to put things together, though no doubt the picture 
he was forming would be a bit off from the truth.
 
&quot;Shampoo think its time to tell Airen truth, Akane.&quot; The Amazon turned 
her head to look at her partner-in-crime, &quot;He figure out sooner or 
later, or ask Nabiki why we together like this.&quot;
 
&quot;Huh? What truth? You two hiding something?&quot; Ranma frowned, as he 
continued to try and ignore the two girls nakedness before him though he 
couldn&#39;t do anything about the stiffness in his pants.
 
&quot;If your sure, Shampoo.&quot; Akane shrugged lightly as she realised nothing 
she would say would make Ranma think otherwise of what he saw.
 
&quot;Fine then,&quot; Akane nodded, as she stood up while leaving her limbs 
covering her private parts, &quot;The truth is Ranma, I&#39;ve been sleeping with 
Shampoo for the past month or so.&quot;
 
No reaction was her reply, as Shampoo rolled her eyes while saying, 
&quot;Think you maybe too blunt Akane? Could cause Ranma brain to frizzle 
out?&#39;
 
&quot;Oh as if you could do any better,&quot; snorted Akane, &quot;and besides, no need 
beating around the bush unless its yours.&quot;
 
Shampoo ignored the girl&#39;s leer, though she briefly wondered what she 
had created as she too, stood up while not bothering to cover her 
assets.
 
Hey, she&#39;s quite proud of her body, ok?
 
&quot;Ranma need to understand this,&quot; The Amazon girl gave Ranma a light left 
hock to the jaw, &quot;Shampoo have no bad feelings towards Akane, we have 
put past behind us and exploring our new feelings.&quot;
 
&quot;Huh?&quot; Ranma mumbled out, as he numbly rubbed his jaw, &quot;did I hear 
that... right?&quot;
 
&quot;Baka,&quot; Akane sighed, &quot;let me try again Shampoo.&quot; Grabbing Ranma&#39;s 
shirt, she pulled him close to her face, speaking in a low sensual tone, 
&quot;In other words, Shampoo meant we are screwing each other and we are 
quite enjoying it.&quot;
 
&quot;Akane need more, more tact Shampoo think,&quot; The purple-haired girl 
sighed, wondering if this whole scene would end, &quot;but Ranma must know 
that some girls like having sex with other girls, you understand yes?&quot;
 
&quot;Forget it, furball, I think I broke his brain though that&#39;s not hard to 
do.&quot; Akane let go of the shocked boy, sitting back on the bed as she 
waited for the Saotome heir to absorb the information.
 
Soon Ranma snapped out of his stupor and started to back away from the 
girls.
 
&quot;That... that can&#39;t be true!&quot; Ranma said loudly, looking back at the two 
young ladies, &quot;girls don&#39;t do that! Its not NATURAL!&quot;
 
&quot;Oh? So you have something against bisexuals?&quot;
 
&quot;Huh? Bi-what?&quot; He blinked.
 
&quot;That&#39;s what I am, Ranma.&quot; Akane sighed, gazing at their fianc&eacute;e as she 
felt Shampoo sit besides her, &quot;I can&#39;t help it if I like both sexes, 
just as Shampoo here can&#39;t help it.&quot;
 
Shampoo nodded to that, as she put her free hand on Akane&#39;s shoulder in 
a gesture of support and affection.
 
&quot;Shampoo known for long time she like both boys and girls,&quot; The Amazon 
added in, &quot;In village Shampoo learn she no mind looking at beautiful 
girls, even had a girlfriend for a time before meeting Ranma.&quot;
 
&quot;G-g-girlfriend?&quot; That stopped Ranma in his tracks, as he stared in 
surprise at the Amazon.
 
&quot;MmMmm, Shampoo have one, she too was a rival but we learn to trust each 
other once get pass problems.&quot;
 
&quot;And that&#39;s the same here, Ranma,&quot; Akane said, &quot;In a way it was a fluke 
that we became like this, or maybe it was meant to be with the current 
situation with your multiply fianc&eacute;es.&quot;
 
&quot;But I-&quot;
 
&quot;Ranma,&quot; Akane interrupted, &quot;Its time to bring this whole mess to a end, 
and Shampoo and I have come to an agreement that since you don&#39;t want 
her as a wife that she needs to at least have your baby which would 
somewhat please the elders in her village.&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, that is what we call spirit of the Kiss.&quot; Shampoo nodded.
 
&quot;B-b-b-b...&quot;
 
&quot;You heard me, a baby,&quot; Akane shrugged, &quot;strange rules to us but Shampoo 
can&#39;t help that, and with what has happen between us I have agreed that 
when she is ready that I would convince you to help her out.&quot;
 
Ranma just stood there stunned, the information he was receiving was 
overwhelming his mind.
 
&quot;Ranma listen to Shampoo.&quot; The Amazon suddenly snapped out, making Ranma 
look at her, blinking.
 
&quot;You no need to marry Shampoo, we married already by village law,&quot; said 
the girl, &quot;and though elders want strong husband stay in tribe no have 
to.&quot;
 
&quot;T-then? Why... ?&quot;
 
&quot;Law was made to make village bloodline stronger,&quot; Shampoo continued, 
&quot;and that mean need make babies with husband.&quot;
 
&quot;So when you get your head out of your ass, Ranma,&quot; Akane added in, 
&quot;you&#39;ll going to honor her when she is ready.&quot;
 
&quot;Hey! I&#39;m-&quot;
 
&quot;Quiet!&quot; Akane nearly roared out, silencing the boy, &quot;you started this 
mess with the Amazons, not just your Father so you&#39;ll going to be 
responsible for once and do the right thing!&quot;
 
Ranma only stared back at Akane in wonder, not to mention a bit of 
confusion and hurt.
 
&quot;You raally like her now?&quot; He finally asked, finally controlling himself 
enough to think right, &quot;its unbelievable to hear you defend her.&quot;
 
&quot;So you want me to boot her back to her village in dishoner then?&quot; Akane 
stared back hard.
 
&quot;Of course not, but...&quot;
 
&quot;Forge it, talking to you now won&#39;t get you to stop thinking of Shampoo 
as an animal!&quot;  Shampoo only sighed sadly, seeing again that Ranma 
continued to view her little more then an annoyance but welcoming the 
warm arm snaking around her shoulder.
 
Ranma viewed this in silence, still trying make sense of his feelings of 
this.
 
&quot;We&#39;ll talk later Ranma, &quot; Akane finally said, as she squeezed Shampoo&#39;s 
shoulder, &quot;but for now, GET OUT!&quot;
 
Knowing better then to disobey the girl with that tone of voice, he 
backed out of the room slding the door close with a troubled look 
covering his features.
 
Looking down as his foot nudged the limp body of Ryouga, Ranma sighed 
out heavily as he grabbed the lost boy&#39;s arm and started to drag the 
heavy load to his room, all along with the image of his finacee hugging 
her rival in a very intimate manner.
 
Back Inside the room...
 
&quot;The Baka!&quot; grumbled Akane, still sitting next to Shampoo, &quot;would think 
he be more understanding.&quot;
 
&quot;You think Ranma tell anyone?&quot; Asked Shampoo, who was staring where 
Ranma had been moments ago, &quot;We no want everyone finding out yet.&quot;
 
&quot;I seriously doubt it,&quot; replied Akane, picking up her shirt, &quot;and if he 
does, no-one will believe him anyways.&quot;
 
&quot;That true.&quot; Shampoo too, started to pick up her clothing, having lost 
any urges to continue on from what they had been doing eariler, &quot;though 
you know Mousse, he overhear something he will overreact like as 
always.&quot; A pause, &quot;and same as stupid Kuno.&quot;
 
&#39;Yeah, those two are good at going mental.&quot; Akane rolled her eyes, &quot;but 
I think for now we&#39;ll be safe since I&#39;m guessing Ranma is confused and 
be&#39;s trying to sort out his feelings.&quot;
 
Shampoo nodded to that, as she redressed herself, &quot;For now we be more 
sutile, yes?&quot;
 
&quot;You, sutile?&quot; snorted Akane with a smirk, &quot;since when?&quot;
 
She got a rap on the arm for that crack, but Shampoo smiled back, 
&quot;Shampoo be much more careful around Akane home, no need having nice 
Kasumi catching us.
 
&quot;That&#39;s true.&quot;
 
As Akane finished dressing, Shampoo said, &quot;Need to go now, but see Akane 
later.&quot;
 
&quot;Right,&quot; Akane turned towards the Amazon giving her a quick hug, &quot;don&#39;t 
worry, he&#39;ll come around and see that there isn&#39;t anything bad about 
showing you affection.&quot;
 
Shampoo slowly nodded, squeezing Akane back before stepping back.
 
&quot;See you later.&quot; With a leap out the window, Shampoo disappeared.
 
&quot;Until next time.&quot; Akane softly said, as she watched the Amazon vanish 
over the rooftops.
 
* * * * *
 
Later that night...
 
At times, Nabiki thought, I really hate taking on the responsibilities 
of the family&#39;s accounts and bills.
 
Sitting at her desk, with sheets of paper, pens, pencils and other odd 
items, the College student was busy with the monthly bills that seem at 
times to never end for the 19 year-old.
 
The routine for years hadn&#39;t changed for her.  Though Kasumi would help 
whenever she could but it always in the end been up to her to keep their 
accounts healthly and balanced.  And if it meant they had to live off 
with little food, water and power, so be it.
 
Even after finishing High-school, she still had to do her schemes, her 
blackmailing and selling information.  Though it annoyed her sometimes, 
in the end she always told herself that it was worth it if it feed them 
and kept a roof over their heads.
 
Shuffling through the many slips of paper, Nabiki was about to look at 
last week&#39;s earnings when there was a knock on her door.
 
Turning her head, Nabiki was curious to see who was making a late night 
visit to her room at this hour.
 
&quot;Come in.&quot; She called out after a moment of thought, then raising her 
eyebrow as the familiar figure entered her room.
 
&quot;Ranma? Now this is a surprise.&quot; Well not really since she had been 
expecting him to come by but at an earlier hour.
 
Ranma, who was wearing a plain looking shirt and shorts, came into the 
girl&#39;s room with a troubled look on his handsome features.
 
&quot;Well since your up and all, and that I need to ask you something...&quot; He 
trailed off, as he stood in the middle of the room shuffling his feet.
 
&quot;Oh?&quot; Nabiki turned in her chair to face him directly, &quot;what&#39;s on your 
mind other then my little sister?&quot; She smiled as the boy frown deepened.
 
&quot;I&#39;m not in the mood for games, Nabiki,&quot; He crossed his arms, &quot;I&#39;ve got 
a question and I don&#39;t want any bull from you tonight.&quot;
 
Oh he is upset about this, she thought, better not push his buttons to 
hard tonight.
 
&quot;Hmmm, a question you say,&quot; The young woman hummed, &quot;and its about my 
sister... so let me have a stab in the dark on what you want to know.&quot;
 
&quot;You want to know either if I knew about her relationship with Shampoo 
or if I had a part in starting it, or maybe both?&quot; She nodded as Ranma 
eyes widened in surprise before narrowing.
 
&quot;So you DO know!&quot; he blurted out, &quot;And you had a hand in it too?!?&quot;
 
Raising a hand to stop him from shouting at her, Nabiki fixed a hard 
stare at him making the boy pause.
 
&quot;I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;ve known.&quot; She stated, &quot;nearly from the start though 
that was by sheer luck.&quot;  Which she didn&#39;t like, being one of those 
people who didn&#39;t believe much in luck, only making it.
 
&quot;But I didn&#39;t set this up,&quot; Ranma opened his mouth at that but Nabiki 
waved him off, &quot;No Saotome I didn&#39;t start this, it was both Shampoo and 
my baby sister who did.&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t believe you,&quot; the boy finally got out, shaking his head, &quot;you 
must have had some hand in this, maybe not in how it started.&quot;
 
So the boy isn&#39;t as dumb as he looked at times, Nabiki though in 
amusement, &quot;Maybe, maybe not, but that type of information must have a 
price.&quot; She had given him enough free info on her involvement already, 
and besides since she knew the boy had no money on him that was worth 
taking and she rather have him promise her a favor.
 
Ranma&#39;s face had screwed up in anger for a few moments but was able to 
control his frizzled emotions after realising that he was dealing with 
Nabiki here and dealing with her never cost you nothing, never.
 
&quot;Fine! If you need me for something I&#39;ll do it,&quot; He sighed, &quot;now tell 
me, did you help in their crazy... whatever it is.&quot;
 
Nabiki nodded, &quot;Yes I did, since I caught Shampoo leaving the house I 
had a little talk with her that lead to an agreement.&quot;
 
&quot;in other words, you help her seduce your own sister?!&quot; Ranma was 
shocked that Nabki would go that low for yen.
 
&quot;Oh please, Ranma-kun, Shampoo had already done that but I think she 
enjoyed it more then she wanted to admit and asked for my help.&quot; She 
shrugged, if it made her sister happy, as well as bring in extra cash 
for the month, so be it.
 
&quot;Whatever! But you still helped her out and now Akane is more interested 
in Shampoo then ME!&quot;
 
&quot;Oh?&quot; Nabiki raised an eyebrow at that, &quot;Do I detect jealousy here?&quot;
 
Ranma only growled at that, while Nabiki smirked.
 
&quot;Oh poor little Ranma, you&#39;re upset that you couldn&#39;t have the first 
crack at Akane?&quot; Then a nasty smile came across the girl&#39;s lips.
 
&quot;Or are you not man enough to even try bedding my sister?&quot;
 
&quot;WHAT?&quot;
 
Standing up, the young woman approached the boy with a glint in her eye.
 
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you even knew what to do with a woman, 
Ranma,&quot; The Saotome heir soon found his personal space invaded by the 
attractive girl, &quot;that would also explain why you haven&#39;t done anything 
with the other fianc&eacute;es, Shampoo for example.&quot;
 
&quot;Her? But why...?&quot; He blinked in surprise as Nabiki grabbed him by the 
shirt and pulled his face down to be only inches from Nabiki&#39;s nose.
 
&quot;If you really don&#39;t find her attractive, then you have problems 
Saotome,&quot; Nabiki purred, &quot;Or as I said, you probably don&#39;t know what to 
do with attractive girls so when she hugs you, you just panic or 
freeze.&quot;
 
&quot;I...But..err.&quot; He mumbled out, feeling his body heat up from Nabiki&#39;s 
closeness.
 
&quot;Inspiring words there.&quot; Nabiki licked her lips, as she stared into the 
deep blue eyes of the Saotome heir, &quot;I sometimes wonder what the ladies 
see in you at times.&quot;
 
&quot;Well...&quot; Ranma swallowed hard, feeling the girl&#39;s hot breath on his 
face.
 
Nabiki meanwhile, was enjoying herself a tad too much.  True she would 
admit the boy was handsome and all, but she had gathered early on that 
he was too much work to maintain.
 
Though she did enjoy making men sweat.  It was true she couldn&#39;t throw a 
punch or a kick, but she considered her whole body as her weapon.  It 
always came in handy in distracting customers who were not happy with 
her.  As well, a few times this type of intimation would work on girls, 
though of course it was hard to detect females who where attracted to 
their own gender.
 
Right now she was using her sex appeal to sniff out Ranma and see what 
type of reactions he would make.  And judging by the way his squirmed, 
not to mention the flushed face the boy did indeed find her attractive 
even if he liked hier sister better.
 
&quot;I should just get it over with and throw you on my bed to show you what 
we girls want from you,&quot; Nabiki chuckled, &quot;but that would be unfair to 
your ladies so...&quot; Letting go, Nabiki stepped back to her desk and 
reached down to her bottom draw.
 
Ranma, who was trying to calm himself down while trying to understand 
Nabiki&#39;s actions, he saw her pull some book or magazine from that draw.
 
&quot;Since I don&#39;t need it anymore... well for now anyways...&quot; The girl 
handed the item to Ranma who finally got a good look at the front cover 
and nearly dropped it.
 
&quot;W-What is this?&quot;
 
&quot;Gees, Saotome, what do you think it is?&quot;
 
&quot;P-Playboy?!?&quot; He exclaimed, shocked that Nabiki would have something 
like this.
 
&quot;What? Can&#39;t a girl have wild dreams and fantasies too?&quot; The girl 
smirked.
 
&quot;Um...&quot;
 
&quot;Keep it, read it and all by mean, look at the pictures and I think you 
might start to develop a better appreciation for the fairer sex.&quot;
 
Ranma felt stunned, as Nabiki started to wave him off, &quot;Get moving now, 
I have work to do and I don&#39;t need to have a live statue in my room 
tonight.&quot; 
 
A speechless Ranma started to move out of the room but before he numbly 
slid the door closed Nabiki called out, &quot;and make sure you hide that, no 
need for Kasumi to end up finding it.&quot;
 
And with that, Ranma finished closing the door with a blank look on his 
face.
 
&quot;I go in there for answers and all I get is me being more confused.&quot; 
Shaking his head, Ranma moved towards his room, still holding the item 
Nabiki gave him while his mind continued to go in circles.
 
 
End of Chapter 4
 
 
Author Notes:
            Oh my hentai! I actually finished this.  I wasn&#39;t sure I 
would continue the series with no feedback from chapter 3.  Anyways, 
right now the series is in a kindof kimbo meaning I&#39;m unsure where to 
take the series from here.  So if you have ideas and suggestions, I&#39;ll 
love to hear them.
 
Next time:
            Ahh the sun, the surf, the babes...and who is that hunk that 
just walked onto the sand with Shampoo?  And what of Ranma, well lets 
just say things are getting a bit botter then normal...
