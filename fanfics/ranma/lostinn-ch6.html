<h1>Lost Innocence (part 6 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/thrythlind.html">Thrythlind</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/lostinn-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Ranma cursed quietly to herself as she walked out of the restroom. She 
had planned to try and wind down from speaking. Getting a strip of 
flesh verbally peeled from her back by that girl did not fit in well 
with that.

&quot;Why does she think I&#39;m lying anyway?&quot; Ranma asked the air around her. 
She leaned against the wall and caught her breath before going back 
inside that room. She had been on edge before, dealing with those 
strangers, publicly admitting to her weakness. &quot;Akane.&quot; 

Akane was probably still testifying while she was cowering out here. 
Ranma took a deep breath and slipped into the Soul of Ice again. She 
opened the doors and quietly entered the audience chamber again and 
walked softly up the aisle, focusing on where Akane was standing at 
that table and talking.

&quot;You think the principal is dangerous because he wanted to give you a 
bowl cut?&quot; somebody asked.

&quot;No,&quot; Akane said angrily. &quot;I think he&#39;s dangerous because he tosses 
around bombs on a daily basis.&quot; He felt someone squeeze his hand and 
turned around to see Ranma sitting down in the chair he had used for 
Ranma&#39;s turn. His eyes narrowed and he gave Ranma a concerned look, 
leaning over and whispering, &quot;Are you okay?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ranma said, giving a shaky smile to assure her. ~I must look 
messed up,~ Ranma thought, wiping at her face with her sleeve.

&quot;Saotome-san,&quot; one of the board members said. &quot;Could you return your 
attention to the matter at hand?&quot; The man continued apologetically as 
Akane leveled a restrained glare in their direction. &quot;The sooner we get 
through this, the sooner all of us can have it over with.&quot;

&quot;I suppose so,&quot; Akane admitted, releasing a breath. He glanced at Ranma 
cautiously and then back to them. &quot;Listen, he personally is dangerous, 
even if you forget everything else, you can&#39;t ignore that.&quot;

&quot;Your school has a number of these martial artists attending, 
correct?&quot; It was that same cynic. &quot;It would seem extreme measures would 
have to be taken.&quot;

&quot;There were six on campus,&quot; Akane said. &quot;Six. Two of them staff. Most 
of the students are just normal kids. And we only ever fight on campus 
when we have to or it&#146;s a school sporting event. Hell, aside from 
sparring, we only ever fight in formal matches or when we have to!&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re saying that there is no need for the Principal&#39;s behavior,&quot; 
someone summarized. Ranma and Akane&#39;s necks cricked.

&quot;That about covers it,&quot; Akane said irritably, eyes narrowed. &quot;As if 
there is a purpose to trying a make the students tardy so that you can 
punish them.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; One of the board asked.

&quot;It&#39;s something he did one time,&quot; Akane said. &quot;Locked the gates, set up 
booby traps along our path to school. Tried to fight people away from 
getting in the school. Is there a practical reason for that?&quot; There was 
silence for quite a few moments. &quot;Didn&#39;t think so.&quot;

Akane waited patiently until they formally dismissed her, but it was 
quite obvious that he came out ahead in the exchange. He bowed in 
acknowledgment to the board and turned to Ranma.

&quot;I don&#39;t need help standing up,&quot; Ranma said with a slight smile in 
response to Akane&#39;s outstretched hand.

&quot;I know,&quot; Akane said, a little embarrassed. Ranma took the hand anyway 
and stood up, leaning into Akane. She concentrated on holding that hand 
and her feet as they walked back to their seats by everyone else.

&quot;The morning is almost done,&quot; some one said. &quot;I propose we adjourn for 
lunch until two o&#39;clock.&quot;

&quot;Agreed,&quot; was the answer, and people began filing out of the room. 
Nabiki looked up as one of her associates broke way towards them. 

&quot;Excuse me a moment,&quot; she said, narrowing her eyes as she stood up to 
meet the girl halfway to the others.

&quot;It&#39;s only eleven o&#39;clock,&quot; Akane said. He paused as he thought about 
that. &quot;Umm, how&#39;d it get so late?&quot; She watched Nabiki and her friend 
talking quietly, noting the worried expression on the other girl&#39;s 
face. This was the first time Nabiki had been out of the house since 
Ryouga had gotten lost, and she was worried about her sister.

&quot;Well, Hinako-san and some of the other teachers spoke first,&quot; Kasumi 
reminded her, also watching Nabiki. &quot;Should we be leaving?&quot;

&quot;No, Ucchan was gonna meet us here,&quot; Ranma reminded them. &quot;She should 
be by any time now.&quot; 

A large envelope passed from the girl to Nabiki and the middle Tendo 
opened it and started sorting through the material, without taking it 
completely out. Her face started out mildly annoyed and suddenly turned 
ashen gray before she let the materials fall back into the envelope and 
closed it again.

Kodachi, watching Nabiki like everyone else, glanced at her smiling 
father as he passed them and frowned. She turned to face Akane, 
obviously angry.

&quot;Would you like some hot water, Akane,&quot; she asked politely.

&quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; Akane answered, blinking at the non-sequitur. Kodachi 
nodded and stood up to head out of the room. 

&quot;What was that about?&quot; Akane asked as Nabiki came back to them, letting 
Kodachi past her.

&quot;Nothing,&quot; Nabiki said. Akane glanced at the other girl&#39;s worried 
glance over her shoulder as she joined the other people leaving the 
area.

&quot;Are you okay, Nabiki?&quot; Ranma asked. Nabiki&#39;s face still looked 
somewhat gray as she forced a smile in Ranma&#39;s direction.

&quot;I can handle it,&quot; Nabiki said. &quot;You&#39;re going to wait outside for Ukyou 
I take it.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t want to wait with us?&quot; Kasumi asked. Nabiki shook her head.

&quot;I&#39;ve...got to think about something,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m going to go get 
some ice cream.&quot; She waved and started to walk away.

&quot;Nabiki,&quot; Ranma said standing up. The other girl passed into the 
exiting crowd before she could reach her. And then Hinako was in front 
of her.

&quot;You did great Saotome-san! Are you...um...feeling okay?&quot; Hinako asked.

&quot;Thanks teach,&quot; Ranma said quietly, wincing at the reminder of her own 
recent testimony. Akane stood up behind her, rubbing her shoulders and 
looking toward where Nabiki had left.

&quot;We appreciate the concern, Hinako-san,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;But we&#39;re sort 
of in a hurry.&quot; The eldest sister was also standing up and anxious to 
follow Nabiki.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Hinako looked around. &quot;Wasn&#39;t Nabiki just here?&quot;

&quot;She left,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;She is going to testify, isn&#39;t she?&quot; Hinako asked, looking at the 
suddenly cold looks she was getting. &quot;I don&#39;t talk well like this.&quot; 
Complained the child-formed teacher. &quot;I don&#39;t wanna be mean, but 
umm...&quot; she looked at her feet and continued softly. &quot;They&#39;ll say what 
happened to you was just...&quot;

&quot;I get it yeah,&quot; Ranma said, shivering. &quot;Just something that happens to 
Ranma, right?&quot; Hinako flushed and nodded.

&quot;Sorry, Saotome-san,&quot; Hinako said.

&quot;Ranma, Akane,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;Why don&#39;t you see if you can catch up 
with Nabiki. I&#39;ll wait here for Ukyou-san.&quot;

Ranma snapped a look at her and flushed as she realized she had 
forgotten Nabiki in dwelling on herself. She glanced up at Akane&#39;s 
face, anxiously split between comforting Ranma and going after his 
sister.

&quot;Hai,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;We&#39;ll make sure she&#39;s all right,&quot; Akane promised. Then both martial 
artists leaped over Hinako and went after the last traces of the 
exiting onlookers.

&quot;I&#39;m really, reallyreallyreallyreally, REALLY sorry, Kasumi-san,&quot; 
Hinako said.

&quot;That&#39;s okay, Hinako-san,&quot; Kasumi said patiently. &quot;You&#39;re not to blame 
for your condition.&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouga winced as he recognized where he had wandered into. The last 
time he had been on this particular farm he had given the resident some 
information that she had not taken kindly. There was the chance that 
she might have calmed down since then. At least she might let him use 
her phone. He managed to acquire what he believed was the front door 
and hesitantly knocked on the door.

&quot;May I...&quot; Akari&#39;s tone turned a little apologetic. &quot;Oh...Ryouga-Kun.&quot;

&quot;Uh, hi, Akari-san,&quot; Ryouga said, embarrassed. &quot;I know you probably 
don&#39;t want to see me, after last time, but...umm...&quot;

&quot;No, no,&quot; she said. &quot;I was just a little upset, a girl does not like to 
be told that she was the rebound girlfriend. Or that he tried to use 
magic to make some other girl fall in love with him, or that he&#39;s been 
posing as a pet to get into that girl&#39;s bed.&quot; Akari&#39;s voice turned 
shades more hostile as she continued, but she shook her head clear and 
replaced the pleasant expression. &quot;I apologize again, perhaps I am 
still a little upset. Those were the acts of an adolescent boy, I 
should not further punish the grown man who admitted and repented of 
his actions.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well,&quot; Ryouga said, scratching the back of his head. Akari 
smiled, amused. &quot;Umm, can I use your phone?&quot;

&quot;Certainly,&quot; Akari said, opening the door wide and stepping out of the 
way. &quot;And perhaps you can stay for tea and we can discuss...things?&quot;

&quot;Umm, yeah,&quot; Ryouga said. He walked into the house cautiously, still 
expecting Akari to go back to being hostile to him. &quot;Where&#39;s your 
grandfather?&quot;

&quot;He is out on the grounds,&quot; Akari said. She watched him nervously make 
his way to the phone. The farm girl demurely sat down in a chair to 
watch and talk. &quot;So how are things in Nerima? I do not get much chance 
to go down to town of late.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ryouga said. He picked up the phone and dialed. &quot;You haven&#39;t 
been around much, but it must be quiet a walk from here to Nerima.&quot;

&quot;Oh, we&#39;re just a few miles out of town,&quot; Akari said, wondering how he 
missed her reference to &quot;going to town.&quot;

&quot;Really,&quot; Ryouga said, surprised. He turned his attention back to the 
phone and sighed irritably as it kept ringing.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Akari said. She paused a moment. &quot;How are Ranma and Akane? You 
mentioned they had settled down.&quot; He had almost moaned about it in 
fact. He mentioned some &quot;horrid atrocity&quot; but he hadn&#39;t made himself 
very clear. It had not been a good build up for him to tell her about 
his past actions.

&quot;She&#39;s doing a lot better,&quot; Ryouga said. Akari was taken aback. &quot;Acts 
more normal at times.&quot;

&quot;Did something happen to Akane?&quot; Akari asked.

&quot;No, Ranma,&quot; Ryouga said, confused. He hung the phone up and picked it 
up again. He looked at her nervously and guiltily. &quot;Didn&#39;t I already 
say something about that?&quot;

&quot;You might have,&quot; Akari admitted. &quot;But I don&#39;t remember it clearly. Why 
did you refer to Ranma as &#39;she&#39;?&quot; She decided not to comment on how 
relieved he was that she didn&#39;t remember.

&quot;I didn&#39;t,&quot; Ryouga said. Akari blinked, she supposed it was possible 
that she misheard. He turned back to the phone. &quot;Kodachi this is...an 
answering machine, great.&quot; He hung up and started dialling again.

&quot;What did happen to Ranma?&quot; Akari asked. She did not know them too 
well, but they her friends. Even if one of them had unwittingly been 
her rival. Besides Akane and Ranma were together now, Akane held no 
threat to her.

&quot;I don&#39;t know that I should be saying anything,&quot; Ryouga said, pausing 
in picking up the phone.

&quot;Please, if there&#39;s anything I can do to help them,&quot; Akari suggested, 
letting the phrase trail off. Ryouga held the phone and took a deep 
breath, then started dialing again.

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have said anything last time,&quot; Ryouga said simply.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Ukyou was in the process of running the final check over the restaurant 
before leaving it in Konatsu&#39;s hands when the phone rang next to her.

&quot;Ucchan&#39;s Okonomiyaki,&quot; she said cheerfully. Then her demeanor changed 
to one of irritation, and she hung the phone up.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Okay,&quot; Ryouga said. &quot;She&#39;s still mad at me.&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;s Ukyou?&quot; Akari asked warily as Ryouga dialed again.

&quot;Wait, Ukyou! Don&#39;t hang up!&quot; Ryouga insisted when the phone was picked 
up again. &quot;What&#39;s with you recently? You&#39;re going around acting like 
everyone&#39;s dark avenger. I thought you gave up fighting.&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;I did,&quot; Ukyou said, taking a deep breath. &quot;Stop getting into the 
lecturing, I got to get out of here like five minutes ago.&quot; She 
listened for a moment. &quot;The school board hearing is today you dimwit! 
I&#39;m already late because I had to carry Konatsu through breakfast rush. 
Oh, you were gone before that got announced, I forgot.&quot; 

She paused and listened to Ryouga ask how he was supposed to get to 
there before it ended. 

&quot;You should have thought of that before you wandered off, jerk!&quot; She 
slammed the phone down and walked out the door.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;School Board Hearing?&quot; Akari repeated, thinking back. 

She stood up and moved out of the room. There was a pile of old papers 
in the back that they used for starting fires when it started getting 
colder, among other purposes. She had found the paper she was looking 
for, she had noticed it before, but hadn&#39;t thought to read it 
seriously. Maybe she hadn&#39;t wanted to.

Akari turned to the bulk of the story after scanning the first page. 
The paragraphs that had convinced her it was just one of those plots 
the principal apparently produced from time to time. She finally 
reached the part about an unnamed student accusing a member of the 
kendo team of &quot;improper advances&quot;

~Horrid atrocity.~ ~She&#39;s doing a lot better. Acts more normal at 
times.~ ~What did happen to Ranma?~ Akari gasped, put a hand to her 
mouth and dropped the paper back in the stacks. &quot;Oh Kami.&quot;

&quot;Wait, Ukyou, how am I supposed to do Nabiki any good out here!?&quot; 
Ryouga shouted. Akari froze. &quot;Damn it! Ukyou&#39;s really getting creepy 
lately. It&#39;s not like I was pretending to be her pet.&quot; Akari came back 
into the room and watched him as he sat down dejected.

&quot;Nabiki too?&quot; Akari asked quietly. She didn&#39;t know Akane&#39;s sister well 
at all. Not more than what she had heard.

&quot;She shouldn&#39;t have to be afraid like that,&quot; Ryouga said morosely, 
thinking of Nabiki&#39;s breakdown. Akari closed her eyes and sighed. 
&quot;Wait, you said you didn&#39;t remember.&quot;

&quot;When you mentioned the school board,&quot; she explained. &quot;It reminded me 
of something.&quot;

&quot;I REALLY shouldn&#39;t have said anything,&quot; he said.

&quot;Ryouga-kun,&quot; Akari said hesitantly. Ryouga looked up at her. &quot;Do you 
need a ride into town?&quot; He looked confused for a moment and then his 
face brightened immediately.

&quot;Oh, thank you, Akari-san,&quot; he said. &quot;Do you know the address?&quot;

&quot;Perhaps you can get it from that Ukyou-person?&quot; Akari suggested. 
Ryouga&#39;s face dropped again, and Akari felt a pain in her chest at the 
obvious concern he was showing. For someone else. &quot;There&#39;s no harm in 
trying.&quot;

She shouldn&#39;t have lost her temper last time. It was just, after so 
many years of being calm and then getting told she was the rebound. And 
all those...questionable things Ryouga had confessed to. She found 
herself unable to take it.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ryouga agreed. &quot;I guess not.&quot; He started dialing again. 
&quot;Konatsu? Oh, thank the kami it&#39;s you, do you know the address to the 
hearing?&quot; Akari felt her own hope drying up, but she had to see to be 
sure.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Jin walked out of the bathroom after finally pulling herself together. 
In the hallway that Kuno girl was at the pay phone and virtually 
yelling into it.

&quot;I don&#39;t care how difficult it was,&quot; Kodachi snapped. &quot;You assured me 
that you would have the materials here by now! If you can not deliver 
do not make the promises!&quot; Kodachi paused a moment. &quot;Of course I&#39;m 
upset, my father is over here making a further mockery of the clan. If 
that&#39;s even possible. Now tell me, do you have the files? Good. Please 
bring them here with all dispatch.&quot; She hung up the phone and turned 
toward the restroom to see Jin, she instantly frowned.

Jin flinched at the look. After the display Ranma had just given her, 
it was hard to forget what the possibilities of being alone with a 
martial artist were. She was comforted to note the light bandaging 
around Kodachi&#39;s arms. As she remembered that Kodachi&#39;s bandages had 
first gone on more than a week ago she became nervous again.

&quot;You&#39;re that rabid little commoner from before,&quot; Kodachi said with a 
sneer. Jin bridled at the commoner comment, recovering some courage. 

&quot;What do you mean by commoner?&quot; Jin asked, a little warily.

&quot;Never mind.&quot; Kodachi glanced toward the hearing room and then back 
towards Jin. &quot;Was Ranma-san&#39;s rather distressed appearance your doing?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s distressed?&quot; Jin asked. &quot;She was just terrorizing me in the 
restroom.&quot;

&quot;That &#39;little piece of fluff&#39; was terrorizing you?&quot; Kodachi asked, 
pointing out the discrepancies in Jin&#39;s descriptions of Ranma. &quot;How 
interesting.&quot;

&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Jin demanded, ignoring the comment.

&quot;Dealing with my father,&quot; Kodachi said simply.

&quot;You&#39;re siding with that pervert against your family?&quot; Jin said 
shocked. Kodachi narrowed her eyes. &quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Little girl,&quot; Kodachi growled. &quot;Who do you think it was that pulled 
that...person off of her? How many people live at the Kuno estate?&quot; Jin 
swallowed nervously. She hmphed. &quot;Such a coward.&quot; She walked away from 
the girl towards the restroom to get Akane&#39;s hot water.

~Ranma&#39;s not lying about the rape,~ Jin thought. She had pretty much 
been decided by Ranma&#39;s behavior in the restroom, but she didn&#39;t really 
want to admit it to herself. ~Oh shit.~

Jin moved out of the way as the doors opened and people started 
filtering out. She moved far out of the way as a group of five boys 
started walking by. She watched them angrily, and took note of the cast 
on one of them with a mixture of satisfaction and guilt. Then she saw 
Nabiki gliding past her.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; she said. Nabiki turned to face her and glared angrily. 
Before she could respond to the girl, Jin continued weakly. &quot;I...wanted 
to ask about Ranma.&quot; Nabiki looked her up and down and continued 
walking along. Jin matched pace with her.

&quot;Ask her,&quot; Nabiki said sharply. Jin looked at her feet a moment.

&quot;I can&#39;t yet,&quot; she said. Nabiki let out a frustrated sigh.

&quot;Are you going to follow me until I talk to you?&quot; Nabiki asked angrily 
as they turned onto the sidewalk and parted away from the crowds.

&quot;I thought it was a scam,&quot; Jin admitted. She mumbled under her breath. 
&quot;I wonder if Kuno had a camera ready.&quot; Nabiki froze. &quot;I&#39;m sorry about 
what I did before. I just want you to let Ranma know that I&#39;m...&quot;

&quot;What did you say?&quot; Nabiki asked.

&quot;I wanted you to let Ranma know that I apologized,&quot; she said, confused. 
Nabiki shook her head.

&quot;No, the other thing,&quot; she said. &quot;About the camera. What was that?&quot; Jin 
bit her lip and paled. Nabiki fingered the envelope in her hands. No, 
she didn&#39;t want to open up to this girl, even on the chance that they 
shared that thing in common. Nabiki remembered the scene in the theater 
too clearly. &quot;I&#39;ll tell Ranma what you said.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jin said quietly, looking sick.

&quot;I take it you&#39;ll be around for later,&quot; Nabiki said. Jin looked at her, 
pale.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Nabiki nodded and shrugged before 
walking down the street. Jin watched leave and took a deep breath, 
before walking to a phone.

&quot;Mom,&quot; she said quietly after dialing. &quot;I&#39;m not looking for another 
job. I&#39;m at that hearing. Y...yes. I...think I need you to...&quot; She 
leaned into the phone. &quot;Could you please come down here?&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Kodachi walked out of the restroom carrying a paper cup full of hot 
water and caught the tail end of the crowd leaving. This was followed 
shortly by Ranma and Akane appearing in something of a hurry.

&quot;Ranma, Akane,&quot; she called out. They stopped and looked at her and then 
appeared somewhat disappointed. &quot;Is something wrong?&quot; She asked, 
confused and handing Akane the hot water.

&quot;What&#39;s th...oh,&quot; Akane nodded and poured the water over his head. &quot;You 
didn&#39;t see Nabiki did you?&quot;

&quot;No, I just barely saw the masses leaving the building,&quot; she said. 
&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;They stopped for chow,&quot; Ranma said quietly. She still looked fairly 
pale, but the initiative in the redhead&#39;s eyes was much more like what 
Kodachi expected from Ranma. &quot;Look, Kodachi, can you keep an eye on 
Kasumi for us. We gotta try to catch up with Nabiki.&quot;

&quot;Certainly,&quot; she said, confused. Ranma nodded and started for the door, 
Kodachi turned to Akane before she could follow Ranma. &quot;What is wrong 
with your sister?&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t know,&quot; Akane said. &quot;She just left.&quot; Then Akane was gone as 
well. Kodachi walked into the mostly empty hearing room as Kasumi and 
Hinako were heading out.

&quot;Ah, Kodachi-chan,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;Are you going to wait for Ukyou with 
us as well?&quot;

&quot;I have messengers of my own on the way here as well,&quot; Kodachi said, 
not saying that Ranma and Akane had left her as a guard. &quot;What was in 
that envelope given to Nabiki?&quot;

&quot;Something that upset her,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;She didn&#39;t say what.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Kodachi said, thinking about her father and wondering if he 
had anything to do with Nabiki&#39;s distress.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;She&#39;s already outta sight,&quot; Ranma said irritably. She kicked at a 
stone angrily.

&quot;She said she was getting some ice cream,&quot; Akane said. &quot;You know where 
she usually goes, right?&quot;

&quot;She won&#39;t be there,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;It&#39;s too far away, but there ain&#39;t 
that many places around here.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;ll bet you know them all right?&quot; Akane asked with a smirk. Ranma 
responded with a fluttering smile and then glanced back at her feet. 
Akane bent down to look in her eyes and brush back her bangs. &quot;Are you 
okay?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s find Nabiki first,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I&#39;m fine, really. It&#39;s 
just...today&quot; Akane nodded in acceptance.

&quot;Okay,&quot; Akane said. &quot;You&#39;re the ice cream aficionado, where to first?&quot;

&quot;I am not addicted to ice cream,&quot; Ranma protested. Akane rolled her 
eyes.

&quot;It means expert, Ranma,&quot; Akane said.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Ranma said, embarrassed.

&quot;So where would someone like you go to get ice cream around here,&quot; 
Akane asked.

&quot;Umm, that way,&quot; Ranma said, pointing. &quot;That&#39;s got the best stuff. That 
I can afford anyway.&quot;

&quot;What about Nabiki&#39;s price range?&quot; Akane asked. Ranma shrugged.

&quot;There&#39;s a really expensive place down that way,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;Well, let&#39;s start there and work down,&quot; Akane said. Ranma nodded 
quietly, not particularly looking forward to returning to her old 
haunts, even the rarely visited ones this far from the dojo. She sort 
of expected they&#39;d find Nabiki before that but it was still making her 
nervous.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Hey, where is everybody?&quot; Ukyou asked as she walked up to where 
Kodachi and Kasumi were sitting on the steps to the building.

&quot;They&#39;re looking for Nabiki,&quot; Kasumi said simply.

&quot;Okay,&quot; Ukyou said, shrugging and sitting down herself. &quot;So is the 
Hawaiian dork finished making an jackass of himself yet?&quot;

&quot;Ukyou-san,&quot; Kasumi said reproachfully, Kodachi merely fumed.

&quot;Hey the whole family seems to like sticking their heads in a mousetrap 
or something,&quot; Ukyou said. &quot;With the exception of Kodachi here, of 
course.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for the consideration,&quot; Kodachi said grimly. Ukyou shrugged 
again as she took out her portable grill and started cooking.

&quot;No problem,&quot; Ukyou said. &quot;I guess I can&#39;t blame you for your family, 
can I?&quot; Kodachi turned deliberately away from her.

&quot;You have been acting quite...oddly, of late, Ukyou,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;Are 
you certain you are doing okay?&quot; Ukyou sighed for a moment and then 
returned to cooking. &quot;Perhaps you should talk to someone.&quot;

&quot;By the way,&quot; Ukyou said. &quot;Ryouga called just before I left. I told him 
about the hearing, but I really don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be seeing anything of 
that jerk for the next few days.&quot;

&quot;That is unfortunate,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;I think Nabiki would be more 
comfortable if he were here.&quot; Ukyou shrugged noncommittally. &quot;I am 
serious, though, Ukyou-san. You should try to talk to someone about 
what happened in the restaurant. You don&#39;t seem to be dealing with it 
well.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m handling myself just fine,&quot; Ukyou retorted. &quot;The closest I&#39;ve 
gotten to a fight since then is that maniac tossing bombs at me.&quot;

&quot;That is good,&quot; Kasumi admitted. &quot;But there seem to be other problems.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m doing all right,&quot; Ukyou muttered softly, trying to pay attention 
to her cooking. &quot;Talk to Konatsu if you don&#39;t believe me.&quot;

&quot;I think I will,&quot; Kasumi assured her. Ukyou ignored that and looked 
towards Kodachi.

&quot;Any luck on the family search?&quot; Ukyou asked. Kodachi narrowed her eyes 
until she realized what Ukyou was talking about.

&quot;Not yet, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; she said. &quot;You saw my advertisement.&quot; Ukyou 
nodded.

&quot;Cheer up, Sugar,&quot; Ukyou said. &quot;I&#39;m sure there are tons of people that 
would love to get a chance to hang around your place.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d rather not admit just anyone, thank you,&quot; Kodachi grumbled.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Ranma said cautiously.

&quot;Yes,&quot; the vendor asked. &quot;What would you like to buy?&quot; He narrowed his 
eyes and scratched his chin as he looked at Ranma.

&quot;Sorry, not here to buy,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Have you seen a tall girl 
with...&quot;

&quot;Nabiki isn&#39;t tall Ranma,&quot; Akane put in.

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I guess I&#39;ve just gotten...used to...&quot; 
Ranma grimaced and her words faded off. Akane watched her worriedly for 
a moment and gripped her hand before turning back to the ice cream 
vendor.

&quot;We&#39;re looking for my sister,&quot; Akane said. &quot;She&#39;s a little taller than 
me with brown hair, kind of in a helmet cut? She said she was going to 
get to some ice cream.&quot;

&quot;No, sorry,&quot; the vendor said. He was still watching Ranma and suddenly 
snapped his fingers. &quot;I didn&#39;t recognize you with the new look. Haven&#39;t 
seen you in a while.&quot; Ranma did look quite different, especially since 
she started letting her hair hang loose.

&quot;Yeah, well haven&#39;t had the money,&quot; Ranma said quietly. The man laughed 
a little.

&quot;You always seemed to find someone to pay for you,&quot; the man said. He 
looked at Akane. &quot;Your friend here really knows how to play a guy.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t do that any more,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;You&#39;re certain you haven&#39;t seen my sister?&quot; Akane asked, eager to get 
off the subject for several reasons.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; the man said, a little confused at Ranma&#39;s subdued attitude.

&quot;That&#39;s fine,&quot; Akane said, shrugging. &quot;So where&#39;s the next place?&quot; 
Ranma thought about it as they started walking away.

&quot;You know Ranma?&quot; somebody asked as he took Akane and Ranma&#39;s place.

&quot;Is that her name?&quot; the vendor asked. &quot;Is she a friend of yours?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; the man explained. &quot;H...She&#39;s a local celebrity of sorts.&quot;

&quot;Ahh. She generally comes by when I&#39;m in this part of the city,&quot; the 
vendor explained. &quot;Always seemed a rather cheerful girl, I wonder 
what&#39;s eating her.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t know?&quot; the customer asked. The vendor shook his head. The 
customer sighed, and gave in to the human desire to trade gossip. 
Everybody likes to be the first person to tell someone something. 
&quot;Somebody slipped a drug in one of those freebies she was always 
getting. She was raped.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; the vendor gasped, then looked off to where Akane and Ranma had 
already vanished. &quot;I wish I had known that before I brought it up. Did 
they catch the guy?&quot;

&quot;I heard he got killed,&quot; the customer said. ~Just what he deserved.~

&quot;Poor girl,&quot; the vendor said shaking his head. After a moment&#39;s 
introspection he looked back up to the customer. &quot;What did you want to 
order?&quot;

&quot;Just a simple cone,&quot; the customer said. And the world rolled on.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Nabiki sat in the back of the booth idly playing with the straw for her 
fruit smoothie. The manila envelope sat on the booth table, looking to 
her about the same as a large scorpion. The contents inside brought 
back memories, and not good ones.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Nabiki squinted her eyes against the sudden flashes. She instinctively 
glanced to where they were coming from in time to see the camera flash 
twice more. Immediately she turned her face away from the camera and 
continued dressing.

She tried not to think about it, tuning out Haseo&#39;s comments about her 
good and bad qualities as a lay. All she had to do was behave for a 
little bit longer and then she could go home. She focused on that, 
trying to keep a blank mind and stone face. 

It was bad enough that the guy had...coerced her into sex. She said 
yes, so at least it wasn&#39;t rape. Right? She wouldn&#39;t answer that 
question for a few more months. Did he have to insult her and take 
trophies too? Did he actually think she wanted to do this, that because 
she said yes that the knife hadn&#39;t been a factor?

&quot;I really scored today,&quot; he said at one point, under his breath. Nabiki 
doubted she was supposed to hear that, and risked a glare at the back 
of his head. She looked back down at her blouse and finished buttoning 
it up before he turned back around.

&quot;I think I&#39;ll walk home,&quot; Nabiki said.

&quot;Are you sure that&#39;s safe?&quot; Haseo asked. He moved out of the doorway 
and leaned against the desk where the knife lay, watching as Nabiki 
gave him as wide a berth as she could while still getting past him. 
&quot;Lots of freaks out there.&quot; Nabiki winced at that and walked on by, 
afraid that he&#39;d be coming behind her with that knife at any time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Nabiki sighed and stared at the envelope again. She had looked for 
those photos, eventually having to settle on taking her own trophy. 
Meaning the knife, of course. She had always hoped that the photos and 
the negatives were somewhere in a secure hiding place that nobody had 
managed to find yet. Apparently she had been wrong.

There was something else in there, not nearly as disturbing, unless you 
included the implications. A little bit of ancient history from her 
first year in Furinkan, before she learned how to cover her tracks 
decently. It wasn&#39;t a major incident at all, but it would give some 
credence to the falsified records of her activities that were included.

Kimi had identified who had given her the envelope to deliver, and 
Nabiki had recognized him as one of that group that had been harassing 
Ranma. The mask gang. They never had responded to her attention the way 
most people had. She had never thought there was a reason to push them 
though, they were mostly outside of her interests. She shivered at the 
thought of what might have happened if she had pushed them, considering 
what the envelope held.

Now they were sending her this envelope, including information only the 
school authorities would have about her. The bomb hadn&#39;t gone off in 
her face, it had been delivered to her. It was the damn knife again. 
They showing her what they had and standing in the doorway. Only this 
time they were threatening her on her own turf.

&quot;Brilliant,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;The Kunos aren&#39;t.&quot; She picked up the 
envelope gingerly, like it was steaming hot, and stood up taking her 
bill to the counter. 

A few minutes later she was walking down the street, not thinking about 
the contents of the envelope. She was trying to only think about how it 
could hurt the people that had sent it to her. The thudding and sound 
of mild panic behind her got some additional attention, and she turned 
to see a large pig barreling down the road in the same direction she 
was heading.

~Akari?~ Nabiki thought, as she noticed the girl on top of the pig. And 
then she saw the rider behind Akari as the pig passed her. &quot;Ryouga?!&quot; 
Nabiki could have cursed herself as Ryouga turned to see her and tapped 
on Akari&#39;s shoulder. The monster pig stopped and sat down, letting 
Akari and Ryouga off easily.

&quot;Nabiki,&quot; Ryouga called out as he came toward her, stopping a few feet 
from her and recoiling for a moment. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Nabiki asked. She looked past his 
shoulder at Akari. &quot;You&#39;ve gotten back in touch with Akari, I see.&quot; 
Ryouga flinched and felt a little guilty for some reason.

&quot;Nabiki!&quot; Akari gasped as she walked up next to Ryouga. &quot;You look 
terrible!&quot; 

The girl drew out a handkerchief and reached out to jab at Nabiki&#39;s 
mouth. The Tendo flinched back and put a hand to her mouth, that and a 
brief taste told her that at some point she had bitten into her lip, 
and it was bleeding.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Nabiki said, waving it aside. She glanced at Akari&#39;s 
pitying face and felt a chill run down her spine as she realized about 
what the girl would next say.

&quot;Are you sure you&#39;re fine?&quot; Akari asked. &quot;After...&quot; She didn&#39;t finish 
as Nabiki&#39;s eyes flared wide and the girl whirled to glare at Ryouga.

&quot;You told her,&quot; she said icily.

&quot;Uhh,&quot; Ryouga started, mind freezing at the most inopportune moment.

&quot;You TOLD her?!&quot; Nabiki virtually screeched.

&quot;I didn&#39;t...&quot; Ryouga started. Nabiki gave an enraged, incoherent shout, 
slapped him and started running off down the street. &quot;Nabiki wait!&quot;

&quot;Katsunishiki, sit!&quot; Akari commanded, and Ryouga found himself buried 
under the monster pig. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Ryouga-san, this is my fault.&quot; Then 
she went running off after Nabiki.

&quot;I knew I shouldn&#39;t have said anything,&quot; Ryouga said morosely. On top 
of him, the giant pig snorted, maybe in agreement.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Akari caught up to Nabiki quickly. A physical life spent training sumo 
pigs giving her the advantage. She grabbed at Nabiki&#39;s sleeve without 
thinking and was shocked to see Nabiki whirl on her with a half-
panicked look before the other girl recognized her.

&quot;Leave me alone,&quot; Nabiki said evenly, angrily.

&quot;He didn&#39;t tell me what happened,&quot; Akari said.

&quot;You expect me to believe that you just figured it out?&quot; Nabiki asked, 
slowing to a fast walk. Akari moved around in front of her. &quot;I don&#39;t 
need help, and I don&#39;t need pity.&quot;

&quot;I...heard about Ranma, from papers and such,&quot; Akari said. &quot;And Ryouga 
was mostly concerned about you. How hard is it to figure out?&quot; Nabiki 
stopped cold and fixed Akari with a glare.

&quot;You think,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;that the only way someone would be 
concerned about me is if I were...&quot; she glanced around to see if anyone 
was listening &quot;...if I were...hurt?&quot; Her voice dropped from a whisper 
to almost inaudible as she finished.

&quot;I think the only way someone would be more concerned about one person 
than another friend who is about to go through a very painful 
experience,&quot; Akari said quietly, stepping forward. &quot;Is if that first 
person is in the same situation and they care a lot about that 
person.&quot; Nabiki was silent for a moment and then released a breath.

&quot;You&#39;re an incurable romantic, Akari,&quot; Nabiki said with a bitter laugh. 
&quot;Ryouga would care more about the mold on his bread than he does about 
Ranma.&quot;

&quot;Maybe before,&quot; Akari said. &quot;But I don&#39;t think so any more. And neither 
do you.&quot; Nabiki shook her head deliberately.

&quot;So you&#39;re saying he didn&#39;t tell you about what happened?&quot; Nabiki 
asked.

&quot;He actually refused to say anything,&quot; Akari said. Nabiki rolled her 
eyes and sighed. Akari was glad to see some of the girl&#39;s normal 
attitude coming back.

&quot;So that&#39;s what happened,&quot; Nabiki said, mostly to herself. &quot;First rule 
of hiding something is not to let people know you&#39;re hiding something. 
Baka.&quot;

&quot;Well, let&#39;s go get him,&quot; Akari suggested, a forced smile on her face. 
&quot;And you can tell him that yourself.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re strangely calm about this,&quot; Nabiki said, noting Akari&#39;s mixed 
emotions as her own came under control.

&quot;I am not like Ranma-san&#39;s suitors,&quot; Akari said simply. &quot;I will not 
force my att...excuse me, I will not become a stalker.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not seeing Ryouga,&quot; Nabiki said as she and Akari started walking 
back to Ryouga.

&quot;I didn&#39;t think you were,&quot; Akari said quietly, a small melancholy smile 
on her face. &quot;I think everything will come out right eventually, though 
it might take a while.&quot;

Nabiki frowned at the wording, but didn&#39;t say anything. The girl was 
trying to be nice after all, no need to take her head off for not being 
good at it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Hey, isn&#39;t that Katsu...Kuni...Cassie...err&#133;Isn&#39;t that Akari&#39;s pig?&quot; 
Ranma asked, pointing out the massive creature sitting on the sidewalk. 
Pedestrians were gawking at him as they cautiously circled around the 
monstrous thing.

&quot;I think so,&quot; Akane said. &quot;I wonder where Akari is though. It&#39;s sitting 
on someone.&quot;

&quot;I guess we should help them out,&quot; Ranma said. Walking around to the 
other side it became easy to identify the unfortunate individual.

&quot;Hey, Charlotte,&quot; Akane said bending down. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; 
Ryouga twitched, it seemed like as soon as Ranma had stopped teasing 
him about that, that everybody else started.

&quot;I think this is Akari&#39;s way to make sure I don&#39;t get lost,&quot; Ryouga 
said.

&quot;Why did she need to leave ya here?&quot; Ranma asked. Ryouga turned his 
head to look at Ranma and decided that she didn&#39;t look much happier, if 
at all, than Nabiki had.

&quot;Because Nabiki&#39;s a little...urk!&quot; Ryouga was pulled, not too 
comfortably, out from under the pig.

&quot;You&#39;ve seen Nabiki?!&quot; Akane demanded.

&quot;We&#39;ve been looking everywhere for her,&quot; Ranma added.

&quot;I&#39;m right here,&quot; Nabiki said coming around the pig with Akari. She 
glanced at Ryouga who looked decidedly scared, to Nabiki&#39;s amusement. 
&quot;Akari explained you were just being incompetent.&quot;

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Akane asked. Nabiki was getting tired of that phrase, 
she suspected Ranma was too. &quot;Whatever was in that envelope seemed to 
shake you up a little.&quot; Akane took a good look at Nabiki&#39;s bleeding 
lip.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Nabiki said, gripping that mentioned envelope. &quot;I just had 
to think about some things on my own.&quot;

&quot;Hello, Ranma,&quot; Akari said cautiously. Ranma looked at her in confusion 
at the tone. &quot;I read the story about you in the paper.&quot; Ranma nodded, 
slumping.

&quot;Please don&#39;t look at me like that,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;I think we need to get going,&quot; Nabiki suggested. &quot;Doesn&#39;t the hearing 
reconvene in the next fifteen minutes or so?&quot; Ranma gave her a thankful 
glance.

&quot;Are you sure you want to say anything?&quot; Ranma asked. Nabiki glanced at 
the envelope in her hand.

&quot;I have to,&quot; Nabiki said. She glanced at Ryouga and grimaced before 
starting to walk down the street. ~Cares about me, huh?~

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;You look like you&#39;re getting anxious, Kodachi,&quot; Ukyou said.

&quot;I&#39;m supposed to be getting some information,&quot; Kodachi explained. &quot;I 
had my lawyer doing some research.&quot;

&quot;What kind of research?&quot; Kasumi asked, politely. Kodachi opened her 
mouth after a moment to answer and then closed it again pointing at the 
odd sight of four people walking alongside a giant pig carrying a fifth 
person.

&quot;Ryouga got here after all,&quot; Ukyou said, sounding of mixed mind about 
that. &quot;With Akari.&quot; Kasumi stood up to meet Nabiki and the others.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;That&#39;s her,&quot; Jin said quietly as Ranma and the others walked in. Her 
mother glanced over and picked out the depressed redhead leaning 
against the taller girl next to her. She grimaced a little at the sight 
of two girls in such an intimate pose.

&quot;Let&#39;s worry about that later,&quot; she said sharply, but not unkindly. 
&quot;Right now we are going to get through this hearing, and then you and I 
are going to the police station.&quot;

&quot;Okay, mom,&quot; Jin said quietly. She glanced cautiously at the boy in the 
cast and was relieved to note that his and his friend&#39;s attention was 
focused on Nabiki.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The room was a little more crowded as things began to start again. That 
detective was there, probably to discuss the accusation that one of 
them killed Kuno. There were witnesses and family who couldn&#39;t get off 
work for the morning taking the empty seats up. Nabiki shivered 
nervously as she considered that.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to,&quot; Ranma said quietly. &quot;Just talk about the bombs and 
stuff, that should be plenty.&quot;

&quot;I have to do this,&quot; Nabiki said. She glanced behind her at Ryouga 
briefly, he really did seem to be racking himself over her situation. 
Then she looked back forward. ~It&#39;s the least threatening option at 
this point.~ She was somewhat comforted by the fact that apparently 
some people didn&#39;t know what she was capable of given ammunition like 
this.

&quot;We&#39;re here for you,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;Whatever you decide.&quot; Kasumi looked 
at the envelope that she refused to let anyone else look in.

&quot;Yeah, I know,&quot; Nabiki said. She looked back at Ryouga and smirked a 
little to reassure him. &quot;They aren&#39;t going to shoot me, Ryouga.&quot;

&quot;I guess not,&quot; Ryouga said, nervously. 

Akari sat next to Ryouga in the seats behind the rest of them. She 
looked somewhat lost and overlooked herself. Nabiki didn&#39;t want to look 
at her, she still had that damn pitying expression in her face whenever 
she looked at Nabiki or Ranma. If it were just concern she could accept 
it, but pity implied a superiority that Nabiki just would not accept 
from anybody. And certainly not Akari.

Nabiki stood up as her name was called and walked up to the table 
carrying the envelope in her hands. She cleared her throat and bent 
forward slightly, maintaining a dignified posture at all times.

&quot;I assume you&#39;re expecting me to further comment on the principal&#39;s 
unorthodox methods of what he calls discipline,&quot; Nabiki said, voice 
steady. &quot;I think you&#39;ve already heard enough about that.&quot; She moved 
around the table and handed the manila envelope to one of the board 
members and then returned to her table.

&quot;Would you mind explaining what is in this envelope?&quot; the board asked.

&quot;That was given to me just before the lunch break,&quot; Nabiki said. &quot;It 
contains some old school records of mine, some falsified documents 
regarding some alleged activities of mine, and...&quot; Nabiki took a deep 
breath. &quot;A collection of photographs taken of me almost two years 
ago.&quot; There was some shuffling in the room behind her at the mention of 
pictures.

&quot;And what does this have to do with...&quot; the question faded off as the 
speaker got a look at one of the photos. It would have taken a blind 
man to not see that the girl in the picture was far from happy.

&quot;Those pictures were taken,&quot; Nabiki said icily, trying to keep her 
cool. &quot;After the photographer had...raped me.&quot; She squinted her eyes 
closed at the ripple of whispering she heard behind her. They were 
looking at her. She knew they were staring at her.

She didn&#39;t turn around, and so didn&#39;t see Jin and her mother trading 
looks.

It would still be shock more than anything else. In one day, two of the 
strongest girls at school had admitted to being victims. When the shock 
died down, however, then there would be pity and ridicule.

&quot;My condolences Tendo-san,&quot; someone asked. &quot;Does this bear on the 
situation at hand? Is it not likely that they were delivered to you by 
your attacker?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s in prison,&quot; Nabiki said. &quot;On another charge. I hadn&#39;t come 
forward.&quot;

&quot;Obviously, and you think this is further proof of the Principal&#39;s lack 
of concern for the safety of the students?&quot;

&quot;The school records,&quot; Nabiki said, grimly. &quot;They were sealed, so it had 
to be administration to release the information.&quot;

&quot;So it&#39;s impossible that a student could get that information?&quot; someone 
asked.

&quot;Why?&quot; Nabiki asked. She paused a moment. &quot;Torture me, they could have 
done that at any time. Why now?&quot; Her expression was distinctly angry 
and pained for a moment.

&quot;With the atmosphere of these rumors?&quot; someone asked. &quot;Seems an ideal 
time for that.&quot;

Nabiki looked down at the table and took a moment to catch her breath 
and hide a few escaping tears. She glanced back behind her to see 
Ryouga starting to stand up. She reached back a hand to wave him back 
down and took a deep breath, straightening up again.

&quot;I&#39;ve tried, and failed, to get to that information myself,&quot; Nabiki 
said quietly. &quot;Legally,&quot; she qualified, &quot;I wanted to know what my 
record said. I was told that the principal was the only one who could 
access that.&quot; Her voice had an undertone of growling. Nabiki did not 
like being toyed with.

&quot;I don&#39;t see any bruising or injuries on these photos.&quot; Nabiki didn&#39;t 
favor the man with even a glare. She was staring down at the table top 
instead. &quot;Didn&#39;t you try to fight back?&quot; Nabiki&#39;s eyes scrunched closed 
as the man asked the same question she had used to accuse herself.

&quot;Hey, leave her alone!&quot; Ryouga shouted behind. Nabiki looked back and 
saw Ryouga standing and giving the board a look that he used to reserve 
for Ranma. She smiled and shook her head, amused.

&quot;I can handle this,&quot; she said back, keeping her face straight. &quot;Just 
calm down, okay?&quot;

&quot;This isn&#39;t fair!&quot; Ryouga insisted. &quot;They&#39;re acting like you&#39;re lying.&quot;

&quot;Ryouga,&quot; Nabiki said. &quot;Please, okay?&quot; Ryouga and Nabiki shared a look 
and he reluctantly sat down, glaring. Akari glanced between him and 
Nabiki, especially at that look and her expression grew a little more 
dejected.

&quot;Are there going to be any more interruptions?&quot; Nabiki had to glance 
back at Ryouga before he stood up again.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Nabiki said.

&quot;So you didn&#39;t try to fight back?&quot; The speaker received some disgusted 
glances from his fellows.

&quot;That has no bearing on the matter at hand,&quot; Nabiki said tightly.

&quot;If you weren&#39;t forced...&quot; he left the rest dangling. Nabiki gritted 
her teeth and glanced back at her family and Ryouga. Almost all of them 
looked ready to jump now. About the same as Nabiki had felt when the 
same man had said to Ranma: &quot;Okay! Assume the rape did happen.&quot; 

&quot;I just ripped my reputation to shreds,&quot; Nabiki said quietly. &quot;Just why 
would I do that?&quot;

&quot;Do you have anything else to say, Tendo-san?&quot; Someone asked after a 
moment of silence.

&quot;No,&quot; Nabiki said. &quot;Not really.&quot;

&quot;You can sit down then.&quot; Nabiki nodded and turned away from the board, 
glaring at the frowning image of the principal. At least two of the 
mask group, the one in the cast and one other, seemed more than a 
little irritated as well.

~Don&#39;t play games with me,~ Nabiki thought darkly, trying to ignore the 
possibility of another form of retribution. She wasn&#39;t succeeding too 
well. She worked to her seat and sat down, glancing back at Ryouga. 
&quot;Thanks a lot, Charlotte. I needed that little rescue.&quot;

&quot;Uh sure,&quot; Ryouga said uncertainly. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;Do you need to go to the restroom?&quot; Ranma asked quietly next to her. 
Nabiki looked to her and then past, to Akane&#39;s concerned face.

&quot;I&#39;m fine for now,&quot; she said finally, turning back to Ryouga. Her hand 
quietly found Kasumi&#39;s and gripped it tightly.

&quot;That was very brave of you,&quot; Kasumi said soothingly. Nabiki wearily 
shook her head and then leaned back in her seat. The board members 
shuffled around some papers around before the called the next person.

&quot;Akada Jin?&quot; they called.

Nabiki glanced back over her shoulder at the girl nervously standing 
up. Ranma followed Nabiki&#39;s gaze and cringed.

&quot;Aww man,&quot; Ranma said under her breath, cringing. If that girl was 
speaking, then Ranma thought she knew what was coming. There wasn&#39;t 
anything she could do to stop it either, and after that display in the 
restroom. She squinted her eyes closed tightly.

Akane circled an arm around Ranma&#39;s shoulders and frowned back at the 
girl walking to the table. Kodachi and Ryouga saw the girl and glared 
as well.

&quot;Is there something wrong?&quot; Akari asked.

&quot;That girl does not approve of Ranma,&quot; Kodachi said spitefully.

&quot;What did she do?&quot; Ukyou asked, eyes narrowed.

&quot;She...&quot; Akane stopped and looked down at Ranma. &quot;Said things.&quot; Ukyou 
only had to look at Ranma to know what kind of &quot;things&quot; were said.

&quot;She apologized,&quot; Nabiki said. Ranma blinked and looked up.

&quot;When did she do that?&quot; Kodachi asked. &quot;She was still spitting venom at 
me before they broke for the afternoon repast.&quot;

&quot;You must have said something to her,&quot; Nabiki said. She took a breath 
and turned to Ranma. &quot;She asked me to tell you she&#39;s sorry.&quot;

&quot;She may have just been afraid of me,&quot; Ranma said quietly. &quot;I got...mad 
at her in the restroom.&quot;

&quot;She is a coward,&quot; Kodachi affirmed bitterly.

&quot;I don&#39;t think she&#39;s looking to get back at you,&quot; Nabiki said.

&quot;I hope not,&quot; Ranma said uncertainly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Now, Akada-san,&quot; someone asked. &quot;What are you adding to this hearing?&quot;

Jin glanced over her shoulder to look at Ranma cringing and staring at 
her fearfully. The short glance produced a visible flinch in the 
redhead. There was a brief surge of satisfaction that she could terrify 
Saotome Ranma so easily, but it vanished in less than a moment by the 
shame associated with the same fact. Jin swallowed and quickly looked 
back at the board nervously.

~Maybe Nabiki forgot to tell her,~ Jin thought. ~Or she doesn&#39;t believe 
it.~ She certainly wouldn&#39;t blame Nabiki for forgetting considering 
what she had just heard the older girl say.

&quot;Akada-san, do you have any testimony on this matter?&quot;

&quot;Uhhh, yes,&quot; Jin said finally. &quot;I do.&quot;

&quot;What is it then?&quot;

&quot;That story about the photographs...&quot; Jin said, fidgeting. &quot;That 
happened to me too.&quot;

Behind her, Akane blinked in surprise and immediately turned to Ranma 
and squeezed her shoulder softly. Ranma was staring in surprise, but 
relaxing, nonetheless.

&quot;Did she just say...?&quot; Ranma asked quietly.

&quot;She must be one of the other girls,&quot; Akane said holding Ranma.

&quot;So why did she say those things?&quot; Ranma asked confused, and a little 
angry. Nabiki merely bit her lip and paid attention to the front of the 
room, looking grim.

&quot;I don&#39;t know who it was!&quot; Jin snapped angrily. &quot;He wore a mask, one of 
those creeps that is always around school.&quot; She felt a hostile gaze on 
her back, but didn&#39;t turn around. No she couldn&#39;t look back to see who 
was staring at her.

~I should have guessed this earlier,~ Nabiki rebuked herself. ~Why 
didn&#39;t I think of this?~ She knew the answer, of course. She didn&#39;t 
want to believe anybody else knew about her. She probably had guessed 
and just shuffled the thought to the back so she wouldn&#39;t have to deal 
with it.

Nabiki glanced over the pack of thugs, not all of whom looked so 
certain any more. She noticed that she wasn&#39;t the only one looking in 
that direction, either. Ranma, Akane, pretty much their entire group 
was virtually glaring at the small group of thugs.

&quot;You don&#39;t have any idea of who it is?&quot; the board asked.

&quot;I...I know he&#39;s one of the jocks,&quot; she nearly spat. If she could stay 
angry she wouldn&#39;t be afraid, she repeated that to herself as she 
answered the questions.

&quot;And how do you know this?&quot; The question was serious, though there was 
a snort from further down the table. Jin gripped the table in front of 
her hard and twisted her eyes closed.

&quot;I didn&#39;t respect them enough,&quot; Jin said in a hollow, angry growl that 
was on the verge of breaking into a sob. &quot;I insulted them, I didn&#39;t 
know my place. He said things like that. Then he took my picture, after 
he was done.&quot;

&quot;I see, have you spoken to the police?&quot;

&quot;My mother is taking me today,&quot; Jin said angrily.

&quot;And why did you wait until now?&quot; The voice was still somewhat snide 
and disbelieving.

&quot;Why do you think!?&quot; she demanded, shouting and crying. &quot;I don&#39;t know 
who did it! Do you think I want people to know I&#39;m...impure?&quot; She 
looked down shoulders shaking frantically. &quot;I...&quot; She collapsed, 
sobbing uncontrollably, to her knees.

The action did not attract much positive reaction from the board. Ranma 
and Nabiki had been fairly stoic, even considering the total loss of 
face. That had been received with a fair amount of very silent 
approval, as had the implications and admissions of handling their own 
battles. Akane had been righteously angered and maintained that. By 
comparison Jin&#39;s uncontrolled mood swings were not accepted.

&quot;Do you have anything substantive to the matter at hand?&quot;

&quot;What do you think I just said!&quot; Jin screeched angrily. &quot;The Principal 
sits in his office plotting how to give us haircuts while he should be 
punishing th...th...these freaks!&quot;

&quot;That nobody seems to tell him about.&quot;

A hand on Jin&#39;s shoulder distracted her from making a retort and she 
flinched away from it. Turning she half-expected to see an animal mask, 
or maybe Ranma, demanding to know why she hadn&#39;t known all along. What 
she saw was her mother. After a moment confirming what she had seen, 
Jin leaned into her mother and broke down.

Ranma looked on with mixed feelings. Mostly, however, she felt sympathy 
for the other girl. The same way shame at her own behavior overcame 
Jin&#39;s satisfaction at seeing Ranma squirm. The redhead gripped tighter 
at Akane&#39;s hand and shifted in her seat.

&quot;Why the hell did she say those things?&quot; Ranma asked quietly.

&quot;Denial,&quot; Nabiki answered.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;If that is the extent of the testimony on the offense.&quot; 

One other girl had testified to something that sounded similar to 
Nabiki and Jin&#39;s stories. Apparently the fifth girl hadn&#39;t even shown 
up. Other than that it was just hearing from teachers and students 
without such extreme stories.

&quot;I suppose it is time to hear the Principal&#39;s response to the charges.&quot;

The Principal stood up trying to look solemn and serious as he 
approached the board. He was marginally successful. The man&#39;s usual 
over-dramatic nature was muted a great deal.

&quot;What do you have to say about the charges against you, Principal 
Kuno?&quot;

&quot;I think it ees a matter of de lack o respect thees generation has for 
authority,&quot; the principal said with some mock sadness, his normal 
accent toned down as well. &quot;Obviously if someteen happens it has to be 
the Principal&#39;s fault. They get a little upset and blow all sorts o 
tings out of proportion.&quot;

&quot;So you don&#39;t think there is a problem in your school?&quot;

&quot;These keiki,&quot; he said shaking his head. &quot;Who knows what they do, get a 
leetle drunk and...&quot; he shrugged.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;He&#39;s still going to pull that?&quot; Ranma growled clutching tightly at 
Akane&#39;s hand and shaking angrily. Nabiki held tight and focused ahead 
of her without looking at anybody directly.

&quot;There&#39;s no way they&#39;re going to let him get away with this,&quot; Akane 
growled.

&quot;He can&#39;t...&quot; Ryouga started to say. Nabiki whirled back to stare at 
him, in the process of standing up. 

&quot;Sit down,&quot; Nabiki said quietly. &quot;If we can stay still you can!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have to like it though,&quot; Ryouga said, sitting down.

&quot;I&#39;m sure everything will be fine,&quot; Akari said. 

Nabiki frowned a little at Akari&#39;s comment. It was thing for Kasumi to 
treat her like that, and Kasumi did without sounding condescending. 
Nabiki refrained from commenting though and just turned back to facing 
front, sparing a glance to look between Akari and Ryouga.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Five counts of...&quot;

&quot;Four claims of rape,&quot; another speaker corrected. He received a few 
glares in response.

&quot;...Several reports of harassment to some degree or another,&quot; the first 
person continued ignoring the correction. &quot;Muggings, absolutely insane 
rules, assaults by you and other staff on the students. You attribute 
all this to rebellious teenagers making false reports?&quot;

&quot;I never see any such tings,&quot; the Principal said. &quot;Perhaps some of the 
boys acting up a little, but that is what boys do. De only real 
troublemakers are dat Ranma and eez friends.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t believe the testimony so far?&quot;

&quot;My Tatchi not need to rape anyone,&quot; he said. &quot;And the rest just be 
hysterical girls.&quot;

&quot;That is a lot of hysteria.&quot;

&quot;You yell shark in a crowded beach?&quot; the Principal asked. &quot;Everybody 
run everywhere. People get hurt.&quot;

&quot;So your testimony is that Ranma yelled rape.&quot; 

The named girl grit her teeth and clinched her eyes shut. Akane was 
glaring hard at the Principal and holding Ranma. She looked as ready to 
jump as Ranma. The other martial artists held similar expressions.

Nabiki maintained a steady, expressionless glare, with an occasional 
look back at Ryouga. It hurt, but she was satisfied that the Principal 
was digging his own grave. She wouldn&#39;t do anything to strengthen his 
case by reacting.

&quot;Well, maybe she drugged,&quot; the Principal conceded. &quot;But how my son know 
that? But she handle on her own don she?&quot; He sounded distinctly angry 
at that.

&quot;You are referring to your son&#39;s death? The police report puts the 
blame for that on a Chinese boy. The same boy apparently spread this 
information in the first place, ransacked your family home and tried to 
kill some of your other students.&quot;

&quot;I don know about the police thinkin. They not know place anywhere,&quot; 
the Principal said.

&quot;And these rules and punishments?&quot;

&quot;I say they have to have haircuts and can no be tardy,&quot; the Principal 
said. &quot;How dose insane rules?&quot;

&quot;The required haircuts are humiliating and beyond anything reasonable.&quot;

&quot;And the tardy rule shouldn&#39;t be accompanied by locked gates that have 
to be fought past.&quot;

&quot;Then there are the sharks in swimming class.&quot;

&quot;It is an exaggeration,&quot; the Principal shrugged. &quot;Was only one shark.&quot; 
It was not taken well.

&quot;Your next witness is a Goto Saru? I think we should talk to him now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Hey, I was just talking to her and she broke my arm,&quot; Saru insisted, 
pointing at his cast. &quot;I&#39;ll be out of action for the rest of the 
season.&quot;

&quot;Out of action? Are you on one of the athletic teams?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, the baseball team,&quot; he said. &quot;You&#39;d think the girl would have a 
better mind than to take another of our best players off. We&#39;re already 
down one.&quot;

&quot;And what happened to the other player?&quot;

&quot;Uhh...he had to leave school,&quot; Saru said. There was a pause.

&quot;I see. Do you have anything to say about these rumors about your 
athletes?&quot;

&quot;That we&#39;re raping people?&quot; Saru asked. &quot;That&#39;s bogus. Like the man 
said. Why? We got girls all over the place. It&#39;s only right, I mean, 
we&#39;re the only thing this school has going for it.&quot;

The doors opened in the back and a man in a suit attracted Kodachi&#39;s 
attention. She sat up and moved to the back quietly under a number of 
curious eyes.

&quot;You&#39;re entitled to girls because of your athletic skills?&quot; At that 
question Saru hesitated.

&quot;Of course not,&quot; he said after a moment. &quot;But that&#39;s what happens 
anyway. Everywhere right? Girls just like us.&quot;

&quot;I suppose so, that will be enough, thank you.&quot; Saru frowned, confused 
as to the reception, then took his seat. Attention was briefly on 
Kodachi thumbing through papers and talking quietly and animatedly with 
the man who had brought them. Then they called up another witness.

&quot;I really don&#39;t think Haseo would do what she said,&quot; the new witness 
said when they asked about the past testimony.

&quot;Which girl are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;Umm...Nabiki,&quot; he said, uncertain. &quot;I mean she went out with him and 
everything.&quot;

&quot;And what does that mean?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what happens on dates, everybody knows that,&quot; the boy said. He 
perfectly unaware of how deep a hole he was digging. &quot;He showed us the 
pictures...&quot; He froze there, finally realizing he had said something 
wrong. The eyes of most of the crowd were boring into his back, and at 
the same time he had the board suddenly very interested.

&quot;Those pictures of Tendo-san. I assume that you or your associates 
delivered them to her.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know about that,&quot; the boy insisted. &quot;I just, you know, saw 
them before. I did the same thing with my girl friend, traded pictures 
you know. He and Saru thought it was cool I guess.&quot;

&quot;Trading suggestive photos is something of a fad then?&quot;

&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; he said. &quot;Man we were all like shocked that he actually 
got Nabiki go out with him.&quot; He was getting himself into trouble again.

&quot;How so?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re talking Ice Queen here,&quot; he said momentarily forgetting that 
Nabiki was currently in the room. Of course, that was temporarily a 
good thing. Had she not been there Ryouga might have done something 
rather...vocal.

&quot;She can be cold, especially since Ranma got to town. I mean did you 
see those pictures? Her expression looks like she just went through the 
garbage or something. Cold, man.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re saying that Tendo-san did not want to do anything then?&quot;

&quot;Huh, yeah, like it was disgusting or something,&quot; he said, confused.

&quot;Like she&#39;d been raped?&quot;

&quot;That only happens with perverts and strangers, right?&quot; he asked. &quot;This 
was a date.&quot;

&quot;Does Principal Kuno provide sexual education classes?&quot;

&quot;There are classes for how to have sex?&quot; the boy asked surprised.

&quot;Thank you, that will be all.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Kodachi said, stepping forward. &quot;Might I be allowed to 
testify?&quot;

&quot;And you are?&quot; 

&quot;Kuno Kodachi,&quot; the girl said. She held the delivered papers in her 
hand as she walked forward. &quot;I am the official head of the Kuno clan.&quot;

&quot;Pay no attention to her,&quot; the Principal said standing up. &quot;She a 
little touched in the head, gets a leetle dramatic at times.&quot; Several 
eyebrows were raised.

&quot;I can have my lawyer present the proper papers if you wish for 
proof,&quot; Kodachi said coolly. Her father simply glared at her.

&quot;I assume that your testimony will not be favorable to your father?&quot;

&quot;Most likely not,&quot; Kodachi said.

&quot;We already closed the witnesses against your father.&quot;

&quot;I am aware of this,&quot; Kodachi said. &quot;But I thought perhaps to do you 
the courtesy of providing this information before the American Embassy 
gets involved.&quot; Her father blanched behind her while most people just 
looked confused.

&quot;Excuse me, I don&#39;t understand why the Americans would be interested 
here.&quot;

&quot;Why the fact that my father seems to be a wanted man in the United 
States,&quot; she said. The room was treated to series of startled gasps and 
rustling.

&quot;I should have thought of that,&quot; Nabiki said, mildly impressed. She 
consoled herself with the fact that she lacked Kodachi&#39;s financial 
resources.

&quot;Perhaps you could explain?&quot;

&quot;Certainly,&quot; Kodachi said stepping forward and handing over the papers 
she had been delivered. &quot;My father left Japan for Hawaii three years 
ago for, I believe, the fourth time. While there he instituted the 
creation of a privately funded center of learning such as our own 
school. The American authorities were shutting him down and seeking to 
arrest him on charges of assault and child abuse just before he 
returned to Japan.&quot;

&quot;We had no information on this...&quot;

&quot;Of course you wouldn&#39;t,&quot; Kodachi said. &quot;He used an assumed name, of 
sorts.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean, of sorts?&quot;

&quot;Koucho Kuno, or Kuno Koucho in the American fashion,&quot; Kodachi said 
with a hint of irritation at the stupidity of it. &quot;A rather simplistic 
method. It is on the papers there.&quot; The Principal was edging out of his 
seat.

&quot;Oh...I see it. How did you get these?&quot;

&quot;My father,&quot; she cricked her neck as she spoke. &quot;Used Kuno money to 
fund his enterprise.&quot; She turned back to face her father. 
&quot;Incidentally, I&#39;ve had your access to those funds removed, and shall 
proceed to remove you from the clan lists.&quot;

&quot;But you can no do that,&quot; the Principal snapped back. &quot;Is not yor place 
to repreemand yo fadder.&quot; Kodachi ignored him and turned back to the 
board.

&quot;I think we should handle this end of the embarrassment before we turn 
him over to the Americans,&quot; she said. &quot;Don&#39;t you think?&quot; There was some 
hesitation from the board and Kodachi frowned. She found one person in 
particular and glared. &quot;In case you missed the fact the first time it 
was presented, my father does not sign the checks of those companies 
owned by the Kuno family.&quot;

The bare threat produced some reaction from the individual she was 
glaring at. A fact that escaped virtually nobody.

&quot;We shall take this into consideration.&quot; The board began to adjourn for 
the back room to discuss the case. Kodachi straightened her dress out 
before turning about to return to her seat.

&quot;I had hoped to have that information sooner,&quot; Kodachi said as she sat 
down. &quot;If my investigators had bothered to check the Kuno finances 
first...&quot;

&quot;You did good,&quot; Nabiki said, cutting her off. She unclenched her fists 
as she said it, catching her breath. ~It&#39;s almost over, when they come 
back I can go home and...It&#39;s almost over.~

&quot;Yeah. Thanks, Kodachi,&quot; Ranma added quietly.

~I could have added something,~ Kodachi thought to herself, a chill 
running up her spine.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The board filed in and settled themselves quietly into their seats as 
the crowd of students, teachers and parents looked on. The whispering, 
chattering and, in some places, sobbing, died down as they prepared to 
answer.

&quot;It has been decided by unanimous decision to remove the Principal from 
his position.&quot; The board said.

&quot;NOOO!!&quot; The former Principal yelled loudly standing up. &quot;It is my 
school and my rools and I say that I am not going!&quot;

&quot;Ryouga,&quot; Nabiki said tightly. The last boy glanced at her. &quot;Wait and 
ye shall receive.&quot; His answer was a feral smile.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid that is not your choice.&quot; The speaker was very concerned 
about the man&#39;s behavior and looking for an escape.

&quot;I be staying to deespline dee keiki just like always!&quot; was the answer, 
with a wide grin. He held up a pineapple and started laughing crazily. 
The area around him was cleared by those that knew about his strange 
variation on the tropical fruit.

Then a large and heavy red umbrella crashed into his face. The Hawaiian 
nut crashed to the ground solidly, seeing hula girls dancing around his 
head. Which was about the time that the pineapple he had been about to 
throw landed on his face and exploded to the sound of scattered 
applause.

&quot;Nice shot, Charlotte,&quot; Akane said appreciatively. Ranma smiled quietly 
in her seat watching the now thoroughly unconscious loon.

&quot;Why do call Ryouga, Charlotte?&quot; Akari asked as the situation winded 
down.

&quot;Oh, didn&#39;t you tell Akari about the figure skating match, Hibiki-
san?&quot; Kasumi asked. Ryouga winced.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

They waited for the crowd to filter out before they exited the room. 
There had been some talk of a celebration, but none of them felt like 
attending. For many of the students this was a great triumph over a 
tyrant. For Ranma, Nabiki and others, it was something exhausting. 
Something they needed to recover from.

~They were probably just being polite anyway,~ Ranma thought as they 
walked out of the room. She glanced to the side and caught sight of Jin 
and her mother coming out of the restroom. &quot;Akane, can you wait for me 
for a moment?&quot;

&quot;What are you...&quot; she looked up and saw Jin, realizing what Ranma was 
talking about. &quot;Are you sure about that?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Could you tell them I&#39;ll catch up?&quot; Ranma asked 
pointing to their family and friends.

&quot;Sure,&quot; Akane said. Ranma took a deep breath and hesitantly stepped 
away from Akane to head for Jin. Of course, she could tell that Akane 
didn&#39;t follow the rest of their group, but let it go

&quot;You all right?&quot; Ranma asked uncertainly, stopping about ten feet from 
them. They turned to face her, and the elder Akada frowned.

&quot;Young lady,&quot; she said. &quot;Now is not the time.&quot; Ranma winced, but firmed 
her jaw in some reproach.

&quot;I just wanted to say sorry &#39;bout the bathroom,&quot; she said.

&quot;You want to say sorry?&quot; Jin repeated, surprised.

&quot;You just...ya know,&quot; Ranma shuffled uncomfortably.

&quot;I told you that now is not the time,&quot; Jin&#39;s mother said. She stepped 
in front of Jin, towards Ranma. The redhead took a step back and 
tensed. &quot;I am not going to hit you, unless you continue to threaten my 
daughter.&quot; Ranma calmed down, marginally, and laughed a little 
bitterly.

&quot;I&#39;m a little jumpy,&quot; Ranma admitted. She reached into her pocket and 
pulled out a card, looking at it hesitantly. &quot;Uhh...here.&quot; He held out 
the card at the end of her reach.

&quot;What is this?&quot; Jin&#39;s mother asked. She took the card and read over it. 
&quot;A support group? That is one of those American ideas, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Hey, it works,&quot; Ranma said, shrugging. She glanced at Jin and then 
away. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to go either.&quot;

&quot;You start all this and presume to give us advice?&quot; the mother said.

&quot;Start all...&quot; Ranma repeated, she crossed her arms tightly and stepped 
back.

&quot;It&#39;s...not her fault,&quot; Jin said reluctantly.

&quot;And will we see you at the police station?&quot; the mother asked.

&quot;Why?&quot; Ranma asked, stepping away again. Before the woman could answer 
she went on. &quot;He&#39;s dead. And the girl that was trying ta drug me for 
herself is a cat for life.&quot;

&quot;A girl drugged you?&quot; the mother said. She ignored the comment about 
the girl being a cat. &quot;Perhaps you should consider changing 
your...preferences. Your current attitude seems to bring you trouble.&quot; 
Ranma frowned.

&quot;You think this happened because I like girls? Shampoo wanted my guy 
form,&quot; Ranma said. He looked back at Akane and glanced at Jin. &quot;I hope 
you&#39;re okay.&quot; She hurriedly fell back to meet Akane.

&quot;They didn&#39;t look happy,&quot; Akane said. &quot;How about you?&quot;

&quot;She doesn&#39;t like me being with another girl,&quot; Ranma said bitterly. 
Akane shook her head and kissed Ranma&#39;s forehead, running her fingers 
through Ranma&#39;s hair.

&quot;I only count one girl here,&quot; Akane said, smiling softly.

&quot;I guess,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;That we&#39;d better catch up.&quot;

&quot;Did I say something?&quot; Akane asked. Ranma shook her head and started 
walking. Akane looked at her in concern before following.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;There&#39;s your stuff,&quot; Nabiki said, pointing into a corner of her room. 
She walked to her desk and sat down.

&quot;Are you going to be okay?&quot; Ryouga asked.

&quot;How&#39;s Akari?&quot; Nabiki asked.

&quot;What?&quot; Ryouga asked, surprised.

&quot;Akari,&quot; Nabiki said. &quot;The pretty farm girl with the over-large pig. 
How is she?&quot;

&quot;Fine, I guess,&quot; Ryouga said. &quot;You saw that.&quot;

&quot;Have you seen the way she looks at me and Ranma?&quot; Nabiki asked. &quot;It&#39;s 
like we&#39;re charity cases.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t need charity,&quot; Ryouga said. &quot;Just some...&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t need you to tell me that!&quot; Nabiki snapped, leaning forward in 
her chair. She leaned back, sighed and quietly added another comment. 
&quot;She&#39;s allowing me to be with you.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Ryouga asked. He shifted on his feet and watched her in 
confusion.

&quot;She&#39;s playing it to the hilt,&quot; Nabiki said. &quot;The sad smiles, the 
&#39;everything will be okay&#39; speeches, but she thinks I&#39;m competition. 
Well, she doesn&#39;t, really, but she thinks I want to be.&quot;

&quot;Competition?&quot; Ryouga asked. &quot;Over me?&quot; Nabiki didn&#39;t seem to be 
listening.

&quot;Girls used to worry about me,&quot; she whispered, staring down at her lap. 
&quot;If the Ice Queen ever deigned to favor one of their boyfriends...but 
now...they are going to be...kind.&quot; She twisted her lip a little at 
that word.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with kind?&quot; Ryouga asked. Nabiki glared at him.

&quot;How do you like it when Akane used to tell Ranma to stop picking on 
you?&quot; Nabiki asked sharply.

&quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; Ryouga said, embarrassed. Nabiki turned about in her desk 
chair and leaned her good arm on the desk.

&quot;I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m telling you this,&quot; Nabiki said. &quot;You apparently 
can&#39;t keep a secret.&quot; Ryouga looked decently embarrassed before he 
continued.

&quot;Are you sure that...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; she said, cutting him off. Ryouga watched her for a few 
moments, staring forward, before picking up his stuff. He started to 
turn to leave and then stopped, snapping his fingers. Nabiki arched an 
eyebrow at the sound.

&quot;That&#39;s right, forgot,&quot; Ryouga said. &quot;Hey...uh, Nabiki.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; she asked impatiently.

&quot;Here you go,&quot; Ryouga said and tossed something on her desk. She 
scooped up the miniature palm tree and blinked. &quot;I...thought you might 
want that.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said, turning to face him. She looked back at the 
trophy and felt odd. 

It was certainly strange that she hadn&#39;t picked up anything for 
herself, perhaps his shears. In fact she had been planning on it. 
Taking the knife and the other trophies had always given her a little 
reassurance, but this time.

&quot;Not that I like the idea of that box,&quot; he said, scratching the back of 
his head nervously. Nabiki favored him with a weak smirk before 
standing up and walking to her closet.

&quot;I don&#39;t see why you should,&quot; Nabiki said, forcing a light tone. She 
kneeled down and started to open her little box of trophies. She 
started to lay the miniature tree inside and froze.

The trophy box was supposed to represent her eventual triumph over 
those that had hurt her and her family. It was never supposed to have 
gotten so full.

&quot;Nabiki?&quot; Ryouga asked, seeing her freeze.

Nabiki brushed the split mask she had gotten from Ranma. After hearing 
Jin&#39;s and that other girl&#39;s stories the mask took new significance, 
where before it had been only a minor trophy of hers. Something that 
had happened to fall into her hands but that she wouldn&#39;t have gone out 
for.

Below that was a shock of black hair that she&#39;d stuffed in her pockets 
before being taken to the hospital for her shoulder. She remembered 
being slammed against that wall and Mousse implying...things.

Then came the shards of wood and a lock of ornamented purple hair. An 
image of Ranma, beaten and broken, came to her mind. Ranma walking the 
edge of life and suicide with pretty much only Akane keeping the 
redhead among them.

Nabiki didn&#39;t see the last item in the box. She reached down absently, 
mind reeling from the images the trophies were calling up. Then she 
snapped her hand back and looked at the fingers bleeding freely, eyes 
wide and more frantic. 

She was remembering, again, that day long ago when reflected light gave 
that old broken knife a semblance of morbid and malevolent vitality. As 
if the knife&#39;s only purpose in existence was to terrify and destroy. An 
unnatural extension of her attacker&#39;s body.

~How many more will I have?~ she asked herself.

&quot;Damn!&quot; someone said and then a hand was softly holding hers and 
brushing at the sliced fingers with a smooth cloth. Nabiki&#39;s first 
reaction was to jerk her hand back and run, but she didn&#39;t.

&quot;Ryouga?&quot; she asked, remembering who was in the room with her.

&quot;Uhh...what is it?&quot; he asked, not realizing she was asking for 
identification. He concentrated on bandaging the cuts, trying not 
realize the position he was in. The cuts were not deep, and he&#39;d have 
them bandaged well soon enough. 

Nabiki glanced at the box again and shivered. She turned her face away 
from the box and leaned into Ryouga, nearly sending him into a 
coronary. The boy&#39;s flinch jarred her shoulder a little, but she hardly 
noticed.

&quot;Umm...Nabiki I can do this easier if you&#39;re...&quot; Ryouga cut himself off 
this time, as he felt the girl shaking against him. He cautiously 
patted her good shoulder and let her cry quietly. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Akari said quietly. &quot;Do you need any help, Kasumi-san?&quot;

&quot;Why thank you,&quot; the elder Tendo said. &quot;That would be nice.&quot;

&quot;There always seems to be so much work to maintaining this house,&quot; 
Akari said. &quot;How do you manage it on your own?&quot;

&quot;It is quite difficult at times,&quot; Kasumi admitted. &quot;Ranma and Akane 
have been helping lately.&quot;

&quot;Well, that is nice,&quot; Akari said. &quot;Where did they vanish to anyway?&quot;

&quot;I suppose they are either in the furo or the dojo,&quot; Kasumi said.

&quot;In the furo? Together?&quot; Akari asked surprised. &quot;Isn&#39;t that rather 
compromising?&quot;

&quot;Why not, they are married after all,&quot; Kasumi said, confused.

&quot;They went through with the marriage,&quot; Akari said, surprised. &quot;Even 
after that?&quot; Kasumi paused in her activities and released her breath. 
She turned to look at Akari.

&quot;Why shouldn&#39;t they?&quot; Kasumi asked. &quot;They love each other.&quot;

&quot;But Ranma isn&#39;t...acceptable any longer,&quot; Akari said. Kasumi shook her 
head, disappointed.

&quot;You are usually a very nice girl, Akari,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;But you seem a 
little too mired in tradition. You do not abandon people in their time 
of need just because it is socially unacceptable to associate with 
them. Nor is it any longer necessary to sacrifice one&#39;s heart to 
society.&quot;

&quot;I suppose that neither of them ever cared much for tradition either,&quot; 
Akari said reluctantly. &quot;Your father did not object?&quot;

&quot;No, they did not,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;Nor did Ranma&#39;s mother, nor I or 
Nabiki. And please keep your own opinions to yourself. They shall get 
enough of that as it is.&quot;

&quot;I shall try not to,&quot; Akari said, sounding ashamed and confused.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Hey, &#39;Natsu,&quot; Ukyou said coming in. &quot;Has it been busy?&quot; She looked 
around, seeing only a sparse number of customers. She expected that at 
this time of day, however.

&quot;Not too much, Ukyou-san,&quot; Konatsu said. &quot;Not more than I could handle. 
Did the trial proceed okay?&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t a trial Konatsu,&quot; she corrected him. &quot;Just a hearing.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Konatsu blinked at the comment. &quot;Well, how did the hearing go?&quot;

&quot;It went just fine,&quot; Ukyou said. &quot;The lunatic is out.&quot; She walked 
around the counter and paused before heading into the back of the room.

&quot;Is something wrong, Ukyou-san?&quot; Konatsu asked.

&quot;You don&#39;t think I&#39;m losing control,&quot; she asked. &quot;Do you?&quot; Konatsu 
didn&#39;t answer right away. &quot;Well?&quot;

&quot;Perhaps now is not the best time to discuss that, Ukyou-san,&quot; Konatsu 
said quietly, glancing at towards the two occupied tables. They 
probably couldn&#39;t hear the conversation, but they were trying. It was 
quite enough for Ukyou at the moment.

&quot;Yeah, bad idea,&quot; Ukyou agreed. &quot;Thanks &#39;Natsu-chan. After closing 
then.&quot; She continued to the back to get ready for work again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Akane glanced down at Ranma after the other girl had quieted down. She 
wasn&#39;t too surprised to find the redhead asleep. Ranma was still going 
to sleep late, sleeping fitfully, and waking up early. Akane was often 
surprised that Ranma didn&#39;t fall asleep in middle of the day more often 
than she did.

Akane took a face cloth and softly washed away the tear tracks from 
Ranma&#39;s face. Ranma didn&#39;t stir except to turn about and bury her face 
in the crook of Akane&#39;s neck. 

The motion surprised the dark haired girl. She had been expecting Ranma 
to either cringe or do nothing. She hadn&#39;t been expecting the pleasant 
sensation of Ranma&#39;s chest pressed against hers.

&quot;He really trusts me,&quot; Akane said, quietly smiling. She leaned back and 
held Ranma, letting her sleep. She thought about that statement for a 
moment and Ranma&#39;s attitude earlier.

It certainly was getting harder to think of Ranma as male. There were 
several things eroding that image, but it wasn&#39;t so much the obvious 
changes that Akane was noticing so much though. The irony of it was 
painfully obvious to her, but the thing that was really hammering in 
Ranma&#39;s feminine state was just how...fragile Ranma was.

&quot;I&#39;m such a hypocrite,&quot; Akane whispered. &quot;Fragility equals female, some 
attitude that is for a woman.&quot; 

Scarier than that realization was the thought that followed. If Ranma 
stayed like this, she&#39;d always need Akane. Akane shivered at that 
thought.

&quot;No way,&quot; Akane said firmly. &quot;I don&#39;t care if you stay a woman, Ranma, 
but I&#39;m not going to let you stay afraid.&quot; Ranma slept on in her arms.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Kodachi watched them escort her father to the interview window and then 
waited for them to back off. The American written constitution they 
lived under might provide for some level of privacy, but she trusted 
her samurai blood to insure that privacy far more than she trusted that 
paper. She frowned as she wondered if that was a sign that she was 
still living in a somewhat bygone age.

&quot;I be having no wish to speak to you wahine,&quot; her father said crossly.

&quot;How long has this been happening in our family?&quot; Kodachi asked coolly.

&quot;Deese?&quot; the man asked. &quot;What be deese?&quot;

&quot;I am in no mood for your affectations,&quot; Kodachi snapped. &quot;You know 
what I am talking about.&quot;

&quot;No I don,&quot; he responded. &quot;And I don care to answer a traitor keike.&quot;

&quot;Then I shall spell it out for you,&quot; Kodachi nearly growled. &quot;Starting 
with about six months ago, when you had me discharged early from the 
hospital.&quot;

&quot;You no need to stay there,&quot; he insisted. &quot;Perfectly healthy.&quot;

&quot;I had tried to kill myself, father,&quot; Kodachi snapped. &quot;I was starting 
therapy and suddenly my doctor is transferred, the hospital is 
virtually tossing me on the street and I am given to understand that I 
should be more careful with plants I might be allergic too.&quot;

&quot;No Kuno kill themselves that way,&quot; he insisted. &quot;Just an accident.&quot;

&quot;I certainly couldn&#39;t be allowed to embarrass the family,&quot; Kodachi 
growled. The former Principal shrugged, maintaining his rather petulant 
attitude. &quot;And you wonder why I arranged to take over the clan.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t be clan head, no woman...&quot;

&quot;The paperwork would seem to disagree with you,&quot; Kodachi said coolly. 
Her father crossed his arms and frowned. &quot;Let me ask you another 
question? Why did we pay Mother&#39;s doctor?&quot;

&quot;For services of course.&quot; He rolled his eyes as if talking to a child.

&quot;The incompetent whose malpractice killed her?&quot; Kodachi demanded.

&quot;We did not...&quot;

&quot;He is still listed as an employee!!&quot; Kodachi snapped. &quot;Did you not 
think I would recognize that name?&quot; She calmed down a moment. &quot;I&#39;ve 
already checked and it IS him. I vaguely remember spending more time 
with mother&#39;s family. Was she going to &#39;embarrass&#39; the family father?&quot;

&quot;You tink da bid kahuna would keel his own wife? I...&quot;

&quot;...loved her?&quot; Kodachi finished. &quot;She had a restraining order against 
you up until the week before you married. How did you convince her to 
marry you? Blackmail? Or was that freak of a brother practicing a 
family trick? Some behaviors are learned after all.&quot;

Her father stared at her, not speaking. She glared back at him for a 
long moment, letting her disgust show. After nearly a minute of silence 
she broke the deadlock again.

&quot;After the Americans get through with you,&quot; Kodachi said. &quot;You are 
coming back to face the Japanese courts. As a ronin. You should be able 
to guess the charge.&quot; Kodachi stood up, sneering and left the room.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Doctor Inohara said. &quot;Am I speaking to a Doctor Ono Tofu? 
Good. I am treating one of your patients in Nerima and am looking for 
her medical history. Saotome Ranma.&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Her?&quot; Tofu said surprised. He waited for a long moment before 
continuing. &quot;Are you a general practitioner? Gyneco...are you treating 
Ranma for anything specific? Before you answer, you have Ranma&#39;s 
permission? Okay then, go ahead.&quot;

As the doctor on the other end of the line told him the situation, Tofu 
had to sit down. He took a long steadying breath before answering.

&quot;I&#39;d rather give you Ranma&#39;s information face to face,&quot; Tofu said. 
&quot;After I have spoken with the patient. I&#39;ll be over as soon as I can 
arrange things.&quot;
