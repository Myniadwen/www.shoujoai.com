She was just finishing closing up the store, Italy having already sent 
Max on home when Aya showed up at the Lounge. She had a impish little 
smile on her beautiful face, one that Italy instantly knew meant 
trouble.

&quot;Do you want to go out with me tonight?&quot; Aya smiled. Her short brown 
hair really suited her, making her look even cuter than she would have 
normally.

&quot;Where to?&quot; Italy asked suspiciously.

&quot;Oh, just a little place I know,&quot; Aya beamed.

Italy decided to try and stall for time, &quot;Maybe I should go home to 
change.&quot;

&quot;You look fine,&quot; Aya looked her up and down quite suggestively.

&quot;Aya!&quot; Italy blushed.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Aya firmly grabbed hold of her arm and they were off.

Italy was a little bit surprised that the club was that close to the 
Lounge, actually. They only walked a few blocks before they came upon 
the converted warehouse. A large neon sign was on the front, reading 
&quot;Arisugawa&quot;s Locket.&quot; Just underneath it, a neon locket opened, 
revealing the cartoon of a pretty girl hidden inside.

The bouncer waved them both by with a simple &quot;Hi, Aya!&quot; and they went 
down the short hallway to be met by another young woman. She was kind 
of cute, and strangely was wearing a Japanese girl&quot;s school uniform.

&quot;Welcome to Arisugawa&quot;s Locket,&quot; Hitomi smiled. She nodded to Aya, 
&quot;Nice to see you again.&quot; She turned to Italy even as she asked Aya, 
&quot;Is this the friend you told me about the last time you were here?&quot;

Aya actually blushed slightly, and Italy wondered what, exactly, she 
had said about her. &quot;Yes, it is,&quot; Aya smiled happily.

&quot;It&quot;s nice to meet you, Italy,&quot; Hitomi bowed to her slightly. She 
looked over at Aya to say, &quot;There&quot;s still a few tables left, and also 
a couple of upstairs rooms.&quot;

&quot;Maybe later,&quot; Aya gave Hitomi a wave as she pulled Italy deeper into 
the bar.

&quot;Upstairs rooms?&quot; Italy echoed questioningly, but Aya only smirked in 
reply. &quot;Oh, right,&quot; Italy blushed, getting it. She looked around, 
trying to get a feel for the place.

Somehow, Italy wasn&quot;t terribly surprised to see that there wasn&quot;t one 
man in the place. The redhead felt a bit light headed, actually, and 
nervous, this being her first time in a bar like this. The women 
around her came in all sizes and colors, as did the busy staff.

A blonde and dark haired girl worked as a team clearing off one table, 
exchanging romantic glances as they worked. A tall girl in what looked 
like a maid&quot;s uniform bustled on by, her nametag reading &quot;May.&quot; And 
nearby her, a girl with a long brown braid was taking a order, dressed 
in what looked like a boys school uniform.

&quot;How did you find this place?&quot; Italy asked Aya softly.

&quot;I only stumbled across it myself a few weeks ago,&quot; Aya admitted.

They reached the bar in a few moments, where quite a little show was 
going on. The two bartenders looked almost exactly alike, with long 
blue hair, matching builds, and almost catlike eyes. The only real 
difference was the scars on the one&quot;s face, marking each cheek.

&quot;Could I get a beer?&quot; a brown haired woman in racing gear called.

&quot;Here you go Priss,&quot; the un-scarred girl literally tossed it through 
the air, and Priss caught it quite handily.

&quot;Thanks Ryouko,&quot; Priss popped her beer with a smile.

&quot;Wine cooler, Minagi?&quot; an aqua green haired girl on the other end of 
the bar asked sweetly.

&quot;Hey, Michiru,&quot; the scarred girl answered, sliding the bottle down the 
bar to her, &quot;will Haruka be here later tonight?&quot; 

&quot;She&quot;s got to go pick up Setsuna first,&quot; Michiru smiled.

The two settled into seats at the bar and Ryouko and Minagi turned to 
them. &quot;What can I get you folks?&quot; Ryouko smiled.

Italy looked at the rows of bottles behind the bartenders and decided 
just to pick something simple, &quot;Beer, please.&quot;

&quot;Rum and coke,&quot; Aya requested.

&quot;Coming right up,&quot; Minagi got the beer out of the fridge while Ryouko 
mixed the drink.

Italy looked out at the crowd and blinked in surprise when she saw a 
tall woman making her way through the crowd. She had a almost regal 
style to her, softened by a slight smile, and her most striking 
feature was her long, almost orange hair. She was a bout to nudge Aya 
and ask who she was when the tall woman walked over to where they were 
sitting.

&quot;Hi, is this your first time here?&quot; she asked in a businesslike style, 
then an odd look appeared on her face. &quot;You run the Lounge, don&quot;t 
you?&quot; she asked curiously.

&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; Italy blinked in surprise, wondering who this strange 
lady was. She felt a flicker of recognition hit her, &quot;She&quot;s the lady 
who comes in to grab all the shoujo mangas!&quot;

&quot;Arisugawa Juri,&quot; the woman shook Italy&quot;s hand, &quot;I run this loony 
bin.&quot;

&quot;I&quot;m Italy,&quot; she smiled, and gestured to Aya, &quot;And this is my... 
lover, Aya.&quot;

Aya&quot;s eyes grew wide, &quot;You introduced me as your lover!&quot; She grabbed 
Italy in a massive hug, &quot;I&quot;m so happy!&quot;

&quot;Can&quot;t... breathe,&quot; Italy gasped out weakly.

Juri chuckled softly, deciding to leave the two lovebirds alone. &quot;Have 
a good time,&quot; she gave them a wave and walked off.
