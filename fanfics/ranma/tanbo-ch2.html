(Ranma)
I grumbled unintelligible things under my breath as I walked behind 
the old gnome. The sun had yet to rise a noticeable distance over the 
horizon and that said clearly that it was early. Too early. After 
yesterday I had for once really not complained to sleep a bit longer 
than sunrise. Of course the old woman had other plans and insisted 
that my training would start today and right now. Only the sliver of 
hope her offer had given me kept me from outright ignoring the gnome.
	After our conversation yesterday and the outrageous 
revelations about that marriage setup from Oyaji it had taken me some 
time to reassure a distraught Amazon that for whatever inane reason 
ever I had NOT gotten it in my head to just leave her on the road as 
soon as I found a cure. Heck, I wasn&#39;t my father. He would certainly 
pull a stunt like that and I was yet waiting for him to show up and 
try smuggle me out of the village. I believed myself to be a lot 
better than the idiot. Which, mind you, was not that hard to achieve.
	After that had been taken care of and Xian Pu assured that I 
would honor her claim first and foremost whatever may happen, the 
next problem was already standing in line. Apparently by now the 
rumors had spread enough and morphed into truly hideous versions 
among the rest of the Amazon. Things like Xian Pu supposedly drugging 
me in order to follow along or her even losing the match on purpose 
so that she could have me with the rest just show... And those were 
the milder tales spun from the shocking news of the much envied 
Tribal Champion taking a female Airen. Of course no one knew about 
the curse aspect since we all seemed to agree this was better so for 
now, and after yesterday I was sure that would fuel the fire only 
further.
	I had to fight a dozen challengers in one hour before I 
finally took refugee in the house and didn&#39;t come out again until 
now. Poor Xian Pu had a hard time calming me down. Yes, I was angry. 
Not so much about being harassed and accused over and over again. 
However, I was mad that my... wife&#39;s own tribal sister would be so 
unbelievable jealous. Some things I had heard had almost made me lose 
my cool and actually doing more than necessary to ward off the 
challengers. I had really wanted to give them a piece of my mind.
	That anger was not really based on the fact that I started to 
actually like Xian Pu. No, the Amazon girl certainly was cute and 
nice. I was used to taunts, crude remarks and all that stuff from 
Oyaji but someone like her didn&#39;t deserve it. She had set herself up 
for this despite knowing what it would to do her reputation to take 
care of me. I could just see her as a more cheerful, happy girl, yet 
circumstances had failed to give both of us nothing but masks society 
had forced us to wear. I had seen glimpses of it at our first night 
and it galled me that I might even be the cause why Xian Pu was so 
solemn since these one day and a half that I knew her. Therefore that 
made me even more pissed that someone, ANYONE would think ill of her. 
Of course this didn&#39;t mean I love her or something...
	Geez, could you go anymore in denial mode? Actually that was 
one thing more I failed to do since falling into that pool. I didn&#39;t 
seem to be able to hide anymore from my problems, how my life had 
turned out up to this point. I saw it all, the whole, bitter truth, 
and could not turn away and shrug it off as I usually did. Try as I 
might, I just couldn&#39;t. And Xian Pu... Maybe I really did care about 
her already. Even if it was only on a compassionate basis right now, 
in my current state she could probably manage to bring me to my knees 
and declare my undying love for her or something... Man, this was 
embarrassing.
	A soft squeeze of my hand reminded me that I wasn&#39;t alone out 
in the early morning air, trotting behind the old woman. No, Xian Pu 
was there as well and that worried look she sent my way made me sick. 
I just couldn&#39;t stand it. For some reason it seemed horrible out of 
place. Squeezing back I tried my best try at a convincing expression 
that would make her drop the worry. &quot;I&#39;m alright, really,&quot; I mumbled 
exasperated and a little bit anxious to see a different emotion from 
the Amazon. As much as I appreciated her efforts, this was gnawing on 
my resolve and it wouldn&#39;t be good to have a mental meltdown right 
here. Ack, I would rather drown myself in that damned pool again.
	Xian Pu seemed to consider for a moment, then, to my utter 
bewilderment, a small, yet happy smile lit up her face. Despite my 
surprise, it was quickly turning into a pleasant one. That was much 
better. I didn&#39;t want any guilt or overdone notions of comfort. I 
wanted to be myself again, cure or not. Maybe that training stuff 
would give me some other things to concentrate on. The Amazon for 
some truly mysterious reason kept smiling all the way to our 
destination but I didn&#39;t complain.

Part 2: Phoenix of Dawn
A Ranma 1/2 Alterverse Fic
Loosely based on the work of Rumiko Takahashi
Concept by Matthias Engel

(Xian Pu)
Being an early riser myself I had no problem with accompanying my 
Airen to her first training lesson. I think she had no real idea what 
she was getting into. Ranma had told me some of the methods her 
father - who was still snoring away like the fat fool that I had no 
hard time believing he was - used to train him. While some of them 
were simply sick and cruel, nothing was like a hard drill from Great-
grandmother when the Elder decided her student was worthy. Ranma was 
in for a surprise and from personal experience I knew the first weeks 
would be the hardest. She would bring you to your limits in every 
lesson and until you got comfortable with her pace, you would have a 
hard time resting.
	Yesterday had been an emotional roller coaster and more than 
once I had wished we could have just stayed with the slow sparring 
from the morning. It had cost me all my resolve to not falter but the 
revelations of Ranma&#39;s father had deeply unbalanced me. This morning, 
for a horrible long moment I had actually feared my Airen was gone to 
this fianc&eacute;e of hers... his back in Japan. Of course, I knew that
was 
stupid and Ranma had made it more than clear that she fully intended 
to honor our laws. It troubled me slightly that in the span of barely 
more than a day and a half I had already developed such strong 
feelings about my Airen. There was something in Ranma though, then 
you managed to look past all the walls that she had placed around 
herself and that must have rearranged themselves upon receiving the 
curse, that the boy-turned-girl was a very special person. And I had 
seen it, in her eyes after the battle that day, when I made my 
decision. For a brief moment I had managed to glance at what my Airen 
truly was. And I longed to see it mirrored on the outside because 
somehow I knew I&#39;d truly regret it if Ranma wouldn&#39;t be in my life.
	Focusing back on the action further in the middle of the 
enclosed mountain area, I watched quietly as Ranma and Elder Kho Lon 
were talking... alright, it was more like Great-grandmother giving my 
Airen some sort of command. Training all my life with the elder women 
I wasn&#39;t one to question her when she advised me to stay here and 
that proved to be a good thing. I had witnessed my Airen&#39;s skill 
before but it seemed what she shared with me were glimpses, only a 
fraction of her full capabilities. Ranma seemed to blur and for the 
first time ever since I could remember there was something akin to 
surprise in the Elder&#39;s face. Elder Kho Lon wasn&#39;t easily surprised, 
especially not by someone&#39;s else fighting skills.
	The cane whirled to deflect a punch I was barely able to see. 
Only my rigorous training allowed me to follow the motions although I 
doubted that I could match them. The &quot;spar&quot; was brief, five maybe six 
seconds. Yet, I had never seen someone going toe to toe with Great-
grandmother. Not like that.
	I was being called over when the Elder put a stop to the 
exchange and therefore could not only see but also hear her being 
impressed. &quot;&lt;Very good, Ranma. You managed to almost top me at half 
my power.&gt;&quot; My Airen blinked, as did I, before a disbelieving 
expression crossed her features. &quot;&lt;No way! That wasn&#39;t half your 
power.&gt;&quot; Elder Kho Lon just smiled in that unnerving manner and I 
made a mental note not to annoy her anymore in future training 
sessions. What was she using in our spars. One percent? I had never 
managed to beat her...
	Not further commenting on our shared disbelief, Great-
grandmother moved over to a formation of rocks and indicated with her 
staff for us to follow. &quot;&lt;Yet, you are nowhere near your full 
abilities yet. Your handling of chi is nothing more than average, 
weak even for one of your caliber and you could move much faster with 
the right training. That can be trained though and we will train.&gt;&quot; 
Standing next to a single rock, she continued: &quot;&lt;First though, I 
would like to see how quickly you learn. Watch.&gt;&quot;
	I had realized already what the Elder was going to do and 
therefore wasn&#39;t surprised, instead I watched my Airen&#39;s reaction 
while Great-grandmother showed her one of the Amazon secret 
techniques. It was amazing to see how Ranma&#39;s face completely shifted 
in the fraction of a moment from mildly interested and still somewhat 
shocked and dumbfounded to deeply concentrated and analyzing. I could 
clearly see in her eyes what could only simply be described as the 
mind of a warrior working as the sound of a shattered boulder reached 
my ears.
	&quot;&lt;This is the Bakusei Tenketsu or Breaking Point technique. 
Everything in this world has a weak point. A point that when touched 
can crumble the entire structure.&quot; Elder Kho Lon looked at Ranma 
quizzically. &quot;Are you willing to try?&gt;&quot;
	And Ranma did try. Walking over to another boulder, she 
seemed to concentrate for a moment, intensely staring at the piece of 
stone. Then, to both mine and Great-grandmother&#39;s utter shock, jammed 
his forefinger into the boulder which promptly exploded upon contact.
	&quot;&lt;Masaka...&gt;&quot; I heard Elder Kho Lon whisper in Japanese for 
what reason ever but I think I could imagine the meaning of the word 
without really comprehending it now. It had taken me months, MONTHS, 
to learn the Breaking Point and I had carried the marks of the 
torturous training for even longer than the training itself had 
transpired. And my Airen... just picked it up...
	Wow...
	Ranma glanced around at us and blinked. &quot;&lt;Nani? What did I 
do? Wasn&#39;t that correct?&gt;&quot; Elder Kho Lon coughed and managed to 
somehow recover quicker than I thought was possible under this 
circumstances. I was still rooted to the spot. &quot;&lt;Quite... tremendous, 
young Ranma. Are you always picking up on other techniques so quickly?
&gt;&quot; My Airen thought for a moment. &quot;&lt;That depends. I really don&#39;t have 
anybody to compare with since Oyaji was only teaching me and didn&#39;t 
learn anything himself so... That Bakusei Tenketsu thing was easy 
though. Just a matter of concentration and trusting your spiritual 
senses for the strike. I don&#39;t really see why this should be so 
spectacular. Sure it could be helpful in a battle once in a while and 
probably to get yourself out of a trap but...&quot;
	Was she just criticizing one of our most secret techniques? I 
looked over at Great-grandmother who seemed to be mildly 
amused. &quot;Indeed. The technique in itself is not that spectacular. It 
is more the training for it that is the actual benefit.&quot; Of course 
Ranma had to ask what that contained of. Then Elder Kho Lon told her, 
she paled slightly and all of a sudden turned her head sharply in my 
direction. There was a question that I could give the answer to 
immediately.
	&quot;&lt;Is true Xian Pu learn Bakusei Tenketsu at age of seven.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;SEVEN?!?&quot;
	After my Airen was through ranting at Great-grandmother I 
wore a proud smile at her concern about my welfare.

(Ranma)
The sun was slowly beginning to set as I dragged myself along the 
path back to the Matriarch&#39;s place. My whole body ached and I never, 
ever thought that something could get to me like that. I really had 
to revaluate my earlier thoughts. Training was usually something I 
was good at, yes. This though wasn&#39;t training. Not at all. This was 
torture. And if the old hag wouldn&#39;t have made clear that she would 
only help me find a cure when I passed her training I would have told 
her exactly what I was thinking about such... training.
	The point was, I had no idea what that old, shriveled fossil 
of a warrior intended to achieve with her methods. I was used to some 
crazy notions from Oyaji but even he hadn&#39;t gone quite that far. I 
was fed up and if I wasn&#39;t so dead tired, I would have ranted all the 
way back from the Council building. What exactly happened? The oh so 
great War Master had the nerve to let me play service girl! All day! 
Alone! For the whole building! And three different, big meetings! 
What the fuck was she thinking!
	In my current state it was a miracle I managed to avoid the 
arrow aimed at my head as I did. &quot;Great,&quot; I muttered as an Amazon 
with chestnut-colored hair tied into a loose bun jumped down from a 
nearby building, &quot;just what I need.&quot; I was in no condition to fight. 
I knew that. And if yesterday&#39;s routine had been any indication I was 
sure that it would result in just that.
	&quot;Stand tall and proud, bad excuse for a warrior,&quot; the other 
Amazon demanded in surprisingly fluent Japanese. I straightened, just 
a little, a brief spark of anger flaring through my body. &quot;Who are 
you calling a bad excuse? I would like to see you &#39;stand tall and 
proud&#39; after one day with the old hag.&quot; Admitted that wasn&#39;t the 
smartest thing to say and I was more than a little suspicious when 
the Amazon simply snarled at me but otherwise didn&#39;t move. &quot;I would 
be proud to be trained by the Matriarch, you should be too.&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;d like to see you trying and then saying the same thing 
afterwards,&quot; I shot back, getting the nagging sense that the Amazon 
wasn&#39;t really out here to fight. Otherwise I wasn&#39;t sure whether to 
be glad about it or not. Word duels were not actually my strong 
point... more my weakest. The Amazon in question looked at me 
critically for a moment and I tried for all it was worth not to look 
like I would fall any moment and snore right there on the ground. 
That&#39;s what I wanted to do actually.
	&quot;Maybe so,&quot; the other girl, she could hardly be much older 
than me and Xian Pu, finally said, relaxing her posture. I didn&#39;t do 
so right away... not that my stance looked impressing to begin 
with. &quot;You have backbone, I give you that. Anyone else with your 
condition probably would be a mental wreck already. Nothing worthy of 
a warrior anymore.&quot;
	I wasn&#39;t quite sure how to take that. As a compliment or an 
insult. Then her words began to really sink in and I double-
blinked. &quot;Wait a minute, you...&quot; There was no way she could know. Kho 
Lon had made it quite clear that my condition should stay a secret to 
the other Amazons, at least until she had informed the rest of the 
Council - which I knew since I was there hadn&#39;t happened today. The 
Amazon cocked her head. &quot;Now, we wouldn&#39;t want to blurt it around the 
whole village, right? Let us just say... I know a lot of things 
others don&#39;t.&quot;
	Now thoroughly confused I, for once, wisely shut my mouth and 
chose to ask Xian Pu later about the girl. I could tell she was quite 
a formidable warrior but there was something disturbingly different 
about her as well. I began to doubt her difference from the rest of 
the Amazons here with her next words. &quot;I still don&#39;t get it why are 
you willing to go along with this tramp. She&#39;s just going to tie you 
down once you find a cure.&quot;
	A familiar annoyance and anger began to stir inside of me as 
I met the Amazon&#39;s look of distain with a heated one of my own. &quot;No 
way! Xian Pu isn&#39;t like that. She is nice and friendly and has done 
nothing but take care of me! It&#39;s not like I have a choice anyway.&quot; 
The other girl snorted. &quot;Right. So you are only going along because 
you have no idea what else to do. Where&#39;s your pride in this?&quot; As I 
said, verbal arguments were not my strong point. &quot;That&#39;s not what I 
mean! I can&#39;t believe all of you think about Xian Pu like a cold-
hearted bitch. I bet none of you have ever taken the time to really 
get to know her. You would be surprised, I tell you.&quot;
	&quot;So, you are not going to just run off when you have a cure?&quot; 
The question was pointed but albeit any of the earlier accusation or 
sharpness. It hit home though. What would I do if I ever got cured. I 
still wasn&#39;t sure what I felt about the Amazon. I liked her, a lot 
maybe. She had made quite clear that her, err... concept of comfort 
would in no way be binding and I believed her. Essentially though, 
the question was only left with one answer. The only honorably one. 
Even if I wouldn&#39;t be happy with it, yesterday had made it quite 
clear that there wasn&#39;t another option.
	&quot;No,&quot; I answered simply and proceeded to ignore and just walk 
right past the Amazon. The girl in question stepped aside and I 
caught a smile on her face that made me pause. It was neither 
relieved, nor really sad. Something in-between. Nostalgic, 
melancholic maybe. I wished once again that I was better at this 
things. The Amazon gave me a nod.
	&quot;Good.&quot; And with that she turned and walked away but not 
before turning back one last time. &quot;Oh, and watch out for Mu Tsu, I 
hear he&#39;ll be back in town soon and he is quite... devoted to your 
wife.&quot; With that she was gone. I hadn&#39;t even learned her name and 
that last statement made me twitch for some reason. That smelled like 
trouble and I had developed a nose for that in a decade with Oyaji 
around. For now though I was still too tired and confused by the 
other Amazon&#39;s attitude to think about it any further.
	Grudgingly I resumed my walk, barely making it back.

(Xian Pu)
The moon stood high over Joketsuzoku but sleep was hard to come. It 
had taken not that long to get a beyond exhausted Ranma into bed. She 
had been almost out of it arriving on our front porch. I had warned 
her that training with Great-grandmother wouldn&#39;t be a hike in the 
mountains or something comparably easy. What exactly my Airen had 
been put through I hadn&#39;t been able to learn. But Ranma had related 
his encounter with Lhi Li. That had somewhat thrown me off balance. I 
hadn&#39;t seen her in the village for a few days and wasn&#39;t even quite 
sure if she had been at the tournament. Actually I never really SAW 
her these days. That was the sad thing because I wished we could have 
at least stayed friends...
	There had been... history between us. Not of the rival kind, 
more of the romantic kind. It had been brief, childish and mostly 
fueled by teenage hormones. Or so we had been told. Both Elder Kho 
Lon and Lhi Li&#39;s family had disapproved of the match. Not because we 
were both Amazons but our statuses in the tribe were to different. 
Lhi Li was an exceptional warrior, no doubt there. But much like 
mother she had dedicated herself more to the art of healing and her 
own passion of dancing. Lhi Li was often frowned upon because she 
refused violence if not totally necessary and would even go as far as 
turn down a challenge.
	Ultimately Kho Lon had all but forbidden me to see her again 
because she was a bad influence. Don&#39;t get me wrong I respect my 
Elder for her teachings and I was sure that being a Matriarch often 
calls for very hard decisions once in awhile. Until now though that 
was one issue I had never forgiven her for. Nowadays I often caught 
Lhi Li watching me from afar. Maybe it was her way of making sure I 
was happy. That she had obviously approved of Ranma so quickly was 
something I wasn&#39;t quite sure what to make of.
	Taking one last look outside, I let loose a heavy sigh and 
slipped back into bed. With the way Great-grandmother tended to 
challenge you the better your skill was, it was unlikely that we 
could get much time for ourselves. Of course once Ranma was through 
learning the Amaguriken - which I suppose was what Elder Kho Lon had 
in mind first -, training methods would change a little. Hopefully my 
Airen could hold up that incredible learning curve she had shown this 
morning with the Bakusei Tenketsu.
	Smiling fondly, I looked down at the sleeping redhead. Even 
with the distractions I had managed to provide the two days we had 
been together the nightmares had still been there and it didn&#39;t take 
a genius to figure out what they were about. Tonight though my Airen 
was much too spent to even think about dreaming anything at all. Her 
hair was ruffled and she hadn&#39;t been able to take a bath either (A/N: 
What, I&#39;m not speaking about a super-modern furo here, but they are 
not THAT reclusive). Still, one could hardly believe all this was 
just a curse. In a way it seemed perfectly natural. The gleaming, red 
hair the soft but very much defined curves - not to mention the more 
intimate areas -, the graceful yet powerful body... Some might call 
it a shame, I called it a blessing. Albeit what my Airen might think, 
it would be even more a waste to not cherish the gift provided to 
her. No male usually got to know what it meant to be a girl. Of 
course, the happiness of my Airen was the first thing on my mind, 
however, I would definitely try to make her more comfortable with 
this form. And that not only physical.
	Once again I wondered why I was so determined about that. Why 
I would try to stand up against every possible difficulty of the 
situation. I couldn&#39;t quite explain. It was a mutual mix of 
compassion and growing feelings. I hadn&#39;t been in love for a long 
time... Never actually since Lhi Li. Most of this was of course Mu 
Tsu&#39;s fault - another problem that would have to be dealt with soon - 
but Ranma had just this certain... thing about her that made me try 
that little extra bit harder, that made me want to defy the 
impossible and make this work. I just KNEW that I had to succeed and 
let this feelings grow. Maybe this was the only chance I would ever 
get for a working, approved relationship that was based on feelings 
from both sides. And for that to work I would have to have some more 
time with my Airen. Something I had to insist on with Great-
grandmother. Training surely was a valuable distraction but personal 
experience taught me that this only served to temporally shut away 
your emotions.
	&quot;Sleep well,&quot; I said, gently stroking through the mass of red 
hair. &quot;Tomorrow will be a busy day.&quot; More like a few busy weeks, 
possible months. Hopefully the effort would be worth it... No the 
effort had to be worth it. I didn&#39;t feel like being alone any longer, 
not after that chance had been offered to me. Ranma and I were meant 
for each other. I could feel it in every cell of my being. And as 
closed up as I had been recently, this was something I could trust my 
heart on. There was a clarity that could just not be defied, not 
pushed back or decided as a weakness. Because if it was a weakness... 
why did I feel like I would actually go through with a death threat 
to anyone who threatened Ranma and our relationship?
	It was true after all, as it seemed, time did not matter to 
the heart. What had at first been anger and confusion and then a 
mutual compassion had almost turned overnight into fondness and a 
love I just could not deny anymore. It did not really matter to me 
that I only knew her cursed form. The body was not really what was 
important. For that brief moment at the challenge log I had seen 
right into her heart, yes, her soul maybe, if that was even possible. 
And beyond all this loneliness, frustration and other emotional 
shields that the redhead had built up over the years, there lay a 
beauty and brilliance that every human - men or women alike - would 
kill for to claim their own and would be more than humbled to have as 
their partner. I had this chance and I was no going to let it slip 
through my hands.
	Ranma turned in her sleep and mumbled something that I wasn&#39;t 
able to make out quite clearly but even so, I could see the beginning 
of a nightmare. So much to too exhausted to dream... A sigh came from 
my lips as I drew the redhead closer, making out words distinctively 
sounding like &quot;Cats... No more...&quot; I blinked at that, not quite 
understanding. Surely I had misheard. The fear accompanying the 
broken words was impossible to associate with something as harmless 
as cats. Unless... I tried to recall one of Great-grandmother&#39;s 
teachings about sealed techniques and shook my head. No way.
	Placing a kiss on my Airen&#39;s forehead I tried my best to 
soothe her and Ranma actually settled down after awhile. For a moment 
I could have sworn that I heard a soft purr coming from her. That, of 
course, was ridiculous.

(Ranma)
Almost four days had passed since the first day of training and the 
evening encounter with Lhi Li. Ironically this had turned out to be 
one of the better parts. The Amazon had somehow managed to 
accidentally cross paths with me more often - and only when I was not 
with Xian Pu - and we had talked quite a bit. She never really let 
much about herself slip, often only listened. She was often there 
when I was working and it helped distract me somewhat. I asked Xian 
Pu a couple of times about her but only got curt and evasive answers. 
It didn&#39;t feel like they had some kind of family feud or something. 
With the readiness Xian Pu had accepted a girl as her wife in the 
first place, I wouldn&#39;t have been surprised if they had some kind of 
history along those lines. I hadn&#39;t pressed the issue though, too 
glad to get some quiet time with either one of them.
	So I found myself out on the outskirts of the village, away 
from most of the turmoil, relaxing and thinking about how the last 
days had progressed. Training had been rough and slowly I had begun 
to accept the torture as this. Xian Pu hadn&#39;t been overly surprised 
when I told her in detail what I was forced to do under orders of 
that old gnome. Some of Lhi Li&#39;s comments had also served to make me 
think. The casual approval of how well I managed to handle all the 
tableware and dishes without slipping once, the slight marvel at the 
reaction speed if I got close to the first. The final straw had been 
this morning when I realized something else. Ever since I started 
training Oyaji hadn&#39;t been able to snack one bite from my plate. I 
always had taken this behavior sort of like speed training. As many 
faults as he might had and whatever his true reasons, his maxim to 
see everything as training for the part held true somewhat. Before I 
started working like a dog for the Elder the food fights had always 
been sort of even. Now, I didn&#39;t even have to really pay attention 
anymore.
	All this lead up to a simple, yet astonishing realization. My 
speed, at least that of my hands, had dramatically increased. What I 
at first saw as quite unbelievable was not too farfetched anymore. 
With a bit more of this I might even really pick those chestnuts from 
the fire without burning myself in the process. Maybe I even could 
already...
	I perked up as my senses tingled suddenly, warning me about 
the arrival of a slightly stronger-than-average chi. Vaulting myself 
out of my lying position to my feet, carefully making sure to not 
misjudge the different balance provided by the different body. That 
was one thing Xian Pu taught me between Kho Lon&#39;s training and the 
rare alone time we got and I was more than grateful for that. I 
turned around, dropping into a light defensive stand, prepared for 
anything, any crazy Amazon either out to tell me how much she 
appreciated my associated with Xian Pu or telling me on no uncertain 
points that I could have made a better choice... Okay, it wasn&#39;t that 
bad. But that attitude towards their champion really pissed me off at 
times. Aside from Lhi Li and maybe the two twins who had departed 
yesterday for a longer journey no one had bothered to actually talk 
to me or Xian Pu. And quite frankly I had no desire to let my day off 
stained by another one of those encounters...
	As it was I was a little bit more surprised to find no Amazon 
there. Well, at least not a female one. The guy was clad in long, 
white robes with long, a little unruly hair. To that he whore a set 
of heavy, thick glasses. And he didn&#39;t look very friendly either. 
Letting caution rule my motions for a moment, I tightened my guard. I 
had the sneaking suspicion that I already knew who the guy was. Being 
warned of and lamented over him from two different sides was enough 
to figure it out.
	&quot;Saotome Ranma, I presume?&quot; Tense muscles, hands hidden, 
obviously in preparation of a quick, pre-emptive strike, chi 
definitely laced with anger. Yup. Had to be him. I didn&#39;t move one 
bit as I met his gaze - or what could be defined that way with the 
glasses. &quot;And you would be Mu Tsu, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;

(Xian Pu)
Whistling a soft tune I sat beside the lake doing some of the chores 
for the day. It was widely misinterpreted by the outside world that 
here in the village men would do everything in and around the house 
while the women were the leaders and fighters. That might be the 
general theme of our society but that did neither mean that men were 
mistreated and unhappy, nor did it mean that we were totally unable 
for matters of housekeeping. Great-grandmother had taught me since I 
was little that I should learn to be independent in everything, even 
those that others might see as unfitting for a warrior of my status. 
The proud were only fools when they failed to acknowledge that you 
could pass down the chores you didn&#39;t like onto those lower than you. 
That was an attitude that would ensure your downfall so much earlier.
	Of course, the fact that there had been no male up to now in 
the Matriarch&#39;s house was also adding to the matter and I didn&#39;t want 
to burden Ranma with something he must be totally unfamiliar with 
right now. What she needed was to built up her spirit, and training 
with Great-grandmother certainly seemed to do this. She seemed to be 
a lot better compared to the first night she came home totally 
exhausted. It appeared that the young Martial Artist had finally 
picked up on the benefits of her training. The general mood still was 
not really cheerful but she was getting there, as it seemed. Training 
seemed to take her mind off her problems and I did my best to divert 
her attention when she returned home.
	I could tell Elder Kho Lon was pleased with her quick 
progress, that&#39;s basically why she had gotten the day off. Alright... 
The fact that there were no official meetings in the Council Hall 
today was another thing. I knew Great-grandmother was finally 
bringing my Airen&#39;s case before the Council - or at least I highly 
assumed that - and didn&#39;t want Ranma around for that.
	One way or another. I was glad to have more than a few hours 
with her. Ranma had gone out to reflect on some things - mainly her 
training I supposed - but she would be back by noon. So we had the 
whole afternoon together and I planned to make it a worthwhile one, 
maybe a nice picnic and a good sparring - after all that&#39;s what we 
both enjoyed - up in the mountains would be nice. I liked the 
solitude of the Bakyhala range and that was exactly what we needed. 
Some quiet time alone, away from the ugly whispers and rumors that I 
knew aggravated my Airen more than it touched me. I had built a 
resistance over the years, still I could not deny that it hurt.
	Sometimes in those lonely hours I had longed for a friend, a 
compassionate soul, anyone who could truly understand me. I think I 
found that someone that day after the tournament. It was a fated 
meeting, I knew, someone had heard my silent wishes and sent me Ranma 
this day. That&#39;s why I knew that I couldn&#39;t throw it away. Ranma 
might be the only chance I&#39;ve got and she was sharing my feelings. 
Deep down we were similar, kindred. We COULD end our loneliness, 
together...
	Right. First you have to get her out of this misery state and 
make her comfortable with the curse because if I think what Great-
grandmother has in mind about the cure she will have to live with it. 
One way or another. Sighing, I pushed away the depressing and 
melancholic thoughts, finishing with the last set of clothing. Taking 
it out from the small river running besides the village - the spring 
was somewhere up in the mountains, I was about to rise, when I felt a 
familiar presence approach.
	Startled at the person who I saw running up to me from the 
village, I must have looked rather stupid just sitting there. Lhi Li 
had never really faced me directly again since that day... I knew she 
and Ranma crossed paths a few times already and that my Airen was 
developing a liking - strictly platonic of course - to the girl. That 
had me hoping that maybe it would bring us closer - as friends at 
least - again. I wanted that, desperately. However, this was a bit 
sudden and as I finally caught up with the worry in the other girl&#39;s 
face, I knew this was about Ranma. Anything short of the Musk Empire 
launching an all-out attack on us - which I&#39;m sure I would have 
noticed - wouldn&#39;t bring her of all people looking for me.
	&quot;Xian Pu, come quickly...&quot; She paused, panting. After taking 
a few breaths, she was finally able to continue: &quot;It&#39;s, it&#39;s Mu Tsu. 
He is back earlier than we thought...&quot; I did not need to know more. 
Of course he must have heard of what happened at the tournament 
already. It was the topic of the village ever since. And of course 
the idiot would rush right up to confront my Airen, seeing a serious 
threat to his devotion...
	Yeah, sure. Devotion. More like obsession. An obsession that 
had driven many possible suitors and/or friends away. I did not 
really blame everything on him but the fool&#39;s possessiveness had 
certainly contributed to the situation. He had taken it VERY badly 
when I was with Lhi Li and almost went about outright killing her 
once. That was about the day I thought I finally lost my childhood 
friend in earnest and left was only the blind shell of obsession. I 
did care for Mu Tsu in a way... But not as he might like it.
	Needing no further word, I placed the basket full with 
clothing on the ground, nodded to Lhi Li who returned the gesture 
with a hesitant but serious smile. A minute later I was already on my 
way, picking up the chi of two of the few people I could call close 
already from afar, I hoped I wasn&#39;t too late to prevent any permanent 
damage.

(Ranma)
&quot;Hey, now wait a minute!&quot;
	As if that was of any use at all. The guy was as deaf as he 
was blind. Probably even more so. As soon as I confirmed my name he 
was on me without asking further question. Not questioning that 
whatever he heard - rumors tended to escalate - was true or demanding 
anything. I had not really believed Lhi Li when she said he had even 
tried to kill someone who got to close to Xian Pu once. Now it became 
painfully clear that she had most likely spoken out of own 
experience. Oh well. It was not as if he could hit me.
	Granted the guy was quick, probably even quicker than I had 
been before arriving here. However, the training from the Old Ghoul 
really began to leave its marks and the female body might lack in a 
bit of strength but that was outweighed by a much more useful 
increase in speed and agility. Therefore Mu Tsu had yet to connect 
with a single attack. Not that it slowed him down any.
	Dodging a chain and swaying to the side to avoid this 
ridiculous &quot;swan fist&quot; - really disgusting - I wondered once again 
how the hell he managed to hide all the stuff in his robe without 
being rooted to the ground. Another feint was equally foreseen and 
countered as I decided that my opponent would not tire out any time 
soon. So it was best to go into the offense. Bending slightly I let 
Mu Tsu&#39;s leg pass me and moved in with a speed that brought an 
astonished look on my opponent&#39;s face. Unleashing three different 
combos in the span of a few moments even surprised me a bit and the 
Amazon warrior stumbled back, nearly tumbling over in pain. But not 
beaten yet.
	That was quicker than I thought. He hadn&#39;t even time to 
react... That really got to me. I knew I was good but pride put aside 
I also knew that I wasn&#39;t that good. That brief skill test from the 
Elder at the beginning of my training, I had gone all out then and 
had hardly been able to move THAT fast. This was a magnificent 
development and I yearned to put this to a more thorough test.
	As if he heard me Mu Tsu provided me with just that test. &quot;No 
way. Nobody will take away and hurt my Xian Pu anymore! Die, Saotome! 
CHIITAN CHUAN!&quot; I blinked at first at the name but when he really 
started to throw eggs at me that exploded upon contact I was a bit 
more weary. Barely avoiding the first wave with just a few scratches, 
I let instincts take other and ignite a Bakusei Tenketsu to shield 
myself in a blast of exploding earth which also provided me with the 
opportunity to reposition myself. Closing my eyes briefly I drew upon 
my inner chi and snapping them open was prepared for the next wave.
	&quot;KACHU TENSHIN AMAGURIKEN!&quot; Even through the thick glasses I 
could see Mu Tsu&#39;s eyes practically bugging out as I picked every 
single egg out of mid-air and returned them to him before they could 
explode in my hands. This was rather similar to the task Elder Kho 
Lon had set me to achieve and with the rate I picked up the eggs and 
did not miss a single one, I was pretty sure that I could pull that 
task off too now. I understood now that the technique was not only a 
matter of speed but also one of the spirit, of adding your chi and 
putting all your heart into it. There was just so much speed a human 
being could manage to achieve on his own, every higher levels had to 
be fueled by your chi. That much I knew already. But that heighten 
sense of awareness was new. I even felt much more in tune with myself 
now.
	&quot;What?&quot; Mu Tsu managed to exclaim before his own egg bombs 
exploded all around him, flinging him through the air in a wide arc. 
I allowed myself a small smirk, after all I had barely touched him in 
the whole fight. Deciding to finish this quickly, I made a jump over 
the dust of the explosions and before my opponent even landed roughly 
from his self-inflicted ordeal I came down with a knee smashing into 
his belly. He let out a gurgling noise as we hit the ground and I had 
my fist drawn back...
	Again it was one of those moments. Before Jusenkyo I would 
have simply punched the fool senseless and let Xian Pu or her Great-
grandmother deal with him. I didn&#39;t do that now. I still hadn&#39;t quite 
figured out the reason. If it wasn&#39;t so ridiculous I would say that 
the curse had inflicted me with a latent gift of empathy. However, as 
I said, that was ridiculous. Nonetheless since Jusenkyo I had gained 
a much better insight of other people&#39;s behavior. Why they did it, 
what motivated them and that sort of thing. Maybe it had just been my 
pride and high confidence preventing me from paying more mind to 
other people&#39;s motives. Maybe it had been Oyaji&#39;s influence... Maybe 
none of this.
	However, this was one of those moments and I could not deny 
that I felt strangely detached as I lowered my fist and stared deeply 
into the Amazon warrior&#39;s eyes. His glasses had come off in the fall 
but he still seemed to be able to focus. Or maybe it was my intense 
gaze that made him focus. &quot;Did you think for one moment that you 
might hurt Xian Pu even more when you succeeded in killing me.&quot; The 
words were not whispered, instead spoken quietly but clearly. I could 
sense a small audience watching us already. Under which Xian Pu had 
arrived just now as well.
	Mu Tsu opened his mouth to say something in return, then 
closed it again as his face slightly paled. &quot;But... You... She... You 
can&#39;t... We are...&quot; There was so much in the other man&#39;s eyes that I 
would normally not have been able to pick up. I pulled back and 
looked up to meet my wife&#39;s eyes for a brief exchange that confirmed 
everything I needed to know right now. &quot;She DOES love you, Mu Tsu.&quot; 
The other man brightened immediately but I was quick to add my next 
words. &quot;As a friend. A friend that she dearly needs. Do you know why 
that is?&quot; Again Mu Tsu went for an answer but nothing came out. I 
knew he was debating with himself. Trying to work himself out of the 
labyrinth of an illusion he had built inside his mind. &quot;Listen to 
your heart, Mu Tsu. If you don&#39;t see the truth now, that friend will 
also be lost to her.&quot;
	Kuso, I sounded corny as hell. Oyaji would probably go nuts. 
But on a basic level I could even understand where all this came 
from. I knew it from my own life. As much as I Xian Pu wanted nothing 
more than to have someone there that she could talk to, relate to. 
Someone her age that was not there to teach or challenge her. Ever 
since Ukyo I didn&#39;t have such a friend. And I missed it. Badly. What 
if my old buddy suddenly turned out to be a girl and would one day 
come wanting to marry me and not see that all I ever wanted was being 
friends? It would crush me, I was sure of that.
	There was a strained silence in which everyone seemed to hold 
their breath. Finally Mu Tsu blinked and I could see comprehension 
dawning in his eyes, comprehension followed by a painful realization. 
Standing up quietly I offered him my hand and to my mild surprise he 
took the offer with a trembling yet strong grip. As soon as he was 
up, Mu Tsu averted his gaze, briefly glancing in Xian Pu&#39;s direction 
who was by now totally stunned at the new development.
	His shoulders were slumped and all in all appearing just like 
I must have been at the tournament a few days ago when Xian Pu had 
threatened to kill me. After almost a minute passed he looked up at 
me. &quot;You are the better warrior, Saotome, and... the better person 
apparently. Take care of Xian Pu, I know you will. As a friend, if I 
can still call myself that, I ask you to take care of her.&quot; And with 
that he turned and walked away. I could see Xian Pu hesitating, 
taking a step after him but Kho Lon who was at her side quietly held 
her cane in front of her and shook her head. He needed time now. That 
was for sure.
	I glanced up at one of the roofs, smiling in the direction 
where I was almost certain Lhi Li was hiding. The Amazon briefly 
showed herself with a smile of approval and then bounded off into the 
distance.
	&quot;Well,&quot; I commented after awhile, &quot;that went better than I 
expected.&quot;

(Xian Pu)
It was two days after the Mu Tsu incident that we found each other up 
here in the Bakyhala mountains finally having this picnic. Ranma and 
I had picked our spot high up in fresh, clear mountain air that 
granted a lovely view over the land below, including my village. The 
event that had been planned two days earlier had been cancelled since 
the confrontation left all participants a little emotional torn. I 
was totally stunned by my Airen&#39;s course of action. Nobody, including 
me, had ever managed to pierce through his stubbornness and wall of 
self-perception. I had understood the dilemma on a basic level but 
since I was the object of illusion it was virtually impossible to 
make him see. It was amazing and quite frankly I was proud of Ranma 
for her to crack that shell and make Mu Tsu finally see the truth. 
However, it wasn&#39;t that surprising after all if you recalled that my 
Airen was ten years virtually with no other friend than the art - his 
father not counting.
	The confrontation left not only Mu Tsu&#39;s heart scarred but 
apparently also tore open a few old ones in Ranma&#39;s. I had not seen 
her for the rest of the day and when she finally returned, she seemed 
to act like nothing was wrong. Yes sure, it was all an act, but by 
that time I had been too worried to think straight and was a little 
pissed. The next day Ranma had probably been begging for forgiveness 
which really made me feel rather shitty, after all it was me who 
should have known that she needed some space after this. I had 
finally given in to her demands that she wanted to make it up to me 
but only under the condition that we would both enjoy ourselves. 
Secretly I had been smiling a little at her obvious concern. I knew, 
as with so many things, instinctually that was not something she 
would normally to do anyone. Which was also a point why I didn&#39;t let 
my joy show openly. The demure attitude was a reaction from the curse 
obviously. As nice as it was, it wasn&#39;t really Ranma speaking... 
well, not totally.
	&quot;&lt;Hey, why so gloomy. Wasn&#39;t it you who said that we BOTH 
enjoy ourselves?&gt;&quot; Ranma&#39;s voice snapped me out of my trance and I 
glanced up with a smile for my Airen. &quot;You are right. It&#39;s just... 
I...&quot; I trailed of, not quite realizing that I had slipped back to 
Mandarin. Which of course didn&#39;t mean Ranma hadn&#39;t understood a word. 
We both had made an effort to learn the other&#39;s language better. It 
was sort of a silent agreement. And Ranma proved that his eidetic 
memory - as Elder Kho Lon called it - was not only helpful to pick up 
new techniques quicker. It was just a matter of wanting to learn... I 
chuckled mentally, that was something I could easily refer to. I 
hated education lessons too, and with Great-Grandmother you just 
couldn&#39;t get away from them...
	&quot;&lt;Just what?&gt;&quot; my Airen asked back in his native language. We 
had often slipped into this routine since both of us seemed to 
understand the other&#39;s native tongue better than speaking it. &quot;Oh, 
it&#39;s just... I... I wanted to thank you for what you did.&quot; It was 
true, I never properly expressed my gratitude for the way she had 
handled Mu Tsu, understanding instinctively that despite everything I 
didn&#39;t want the fool dead or hurt severely.
	Of course Ranma being Ranma, albeit all the qualities she had 
shown in handling the blind fool, was still rather clueless at 
times. &quot;&lt;Eh? What do you mean?&gt;&quot; Like now. I sighed then giggled 
slightly which caused my companion to be even more confused and to 
look a bit hurt. Suddenly snapping back to serious again I stared up 
at the mountain tops. &quot;Thank you for understanding. About Mu Tsu.&quot;
	&quot;Oh.&quot; There was a silence following and after awhile I looked 
ahead again when I felt a hand resting on my shoulder. Ranma stood, 
slightly bowed forward over me, a little sweat from training the 
Dragon - at least the motions for now - for the past half an hour was 
still glistering all over my Airen&#39;s beautiful face and shimmering 
red hair. All of that paled though in comparison when our eyes 
locked. Just like that day of the tournament, the day I had spared 
the cursed young man&#39;s life, the day I fell in love with this lonely 
soul that was just like me.
	The realization and clarity came as quite a bit of a shock. 
Yes, I had fallen for her that moment. I had already been totally 
lost then. It made sense after all. I was so dead set on executing my 
revenge that nothing short of a cosmic miracle could have stopped me 
to follow through with the killing blow... A cosmic miracle or just 
simple love. It didn&#39;t matter really that we barely knew each other. 
Time wasn&#39;t the important factor for love. Time didn&#39;t matter for the 
heart. It wasn&#39;t important if boy or girl. It were those eyes - eyes 
that were said to be the mirror of one&#39;s soul - that had captured me 
from that very moment without any chance of ever releasing that hold 
again.
	&quot;Ranma...&quot; I whispered, aware that there were tears forming 
in the corner of my eyes. The redhead looked a little uncomfortable 
with the sudden emotional turmoil directed at her that was for sure. 
To her credit she didn&#39;t pull back. Not even when I reached out to 
pull the slender yet powerful girl down against me. She let out a 
small squeal of surprise though which was caught of quickly by a 
heated kiss. After a short time of half-hearted struggling my Airen 
melted into the contact which continued for quite some time.
	Finally I pulled back, to gaze at Ranma who was totally 
flustered and unable to form a coherent sound or move from her 
awkward position in my lap. Not that I minded. I reached up to brush 
through some red strands and then settled my hand on her left cheek 
to cup her face gently. &quot;What are you doing to me?&quot; I whispered 
amazed at the reaction my whole being suddenly showed. It was not 
only my body, but my heart and spirit danced with a joy I had not 
known since Mother left. Scars that I thought I would carry forever 
on my soul seemed to heal... No, I truly couldn&#39;t grasp all that the 
young cursed boy/girl did to me. The one thing was and remained clear 
now though. &quot;&lt;Aishiteru,&gt;&quot; I whispered the words in her native tongue.
	&quot;&lt;Xian Pu...&gt;&quot; Ranma shifted a little uncomfortable. She was 
about to say something in return but I placed a finger on her lips, 
hushing her effectively. &quot;Don&#39;t. You are not ready yet. I don&#39;t 
expect you to answer to that right now.&quot; I wanted. My heart yearned 
to hear those words returned. But it was better this way. Ranma 
wasn&#39;t ready yet. And she wasn&#39;t quite herself again. As much as I 
wanted to hear her speak those words, I wanted it to be the real 
Ranma, free of the mantle of sadness and shame the curse had put 
around her. I wanted it to come from the heart, not just because she 
felt it necessary.
	I was a little surprised to have Ranma lean forward to 
actually fall into an embrace. Usually it was me who had to 
initialize those things. Those simple gestures most of the time 
weren&#39;t speaking much about love. They were comfort, a safe harbor 
for my Airen to run away from her misery. This time something felt 
different though. &quot;&lt;Arigato.&gt;&quot; I blinked, surprised and confused at 
the same time. I was about to ask what she was thanking ME for but 
Ranma was already explaining. &quot;&lt;You know, the thing with Mu Tsu. I 
still don&#39;t know how I did it, usually I just screw such things up. I 
thought it had something to do with the curse. Maybe that is true. 
But a lot of it is your doing. Compared to what you did and still do 
for me here, helping your friend see the truth is a small thing. You 
are right, I&#39;m not ready yet to say those words. Demo, I... I just 
want to thank you for being here... for me.&gt;&quot; A single tear slipped 
past the redhead&#39;s closed eyelids and even so close it was a strain 
to make out the last whispered words. &quot;&lt;No one ever did.&gt;&quot;
	I was at a loss of what to do, completely stunned by the 
honest and touching words from the girl in my arms. However, somehow 
I knew that this moment didn&#39;t need any further words as I simply 
continued holding my Airen for awhile. The moment had been a seminal 
one, one of honest declarations, feelings shared and discovered. And 
I had felt that a real hope was built today. The glimmer that had 
begun a few days ago had evolved into a tiny star now. A star of hope 
for both of our futures. A shared future. One that might not be so 
lonely anymore.

(Genma)
Who would have thought. Me, Saotome Genma trapped in a village of 
females who pretended to be warriors. Hah, what a ridiculous thought. 
I looked sheepishly around but chided me right away for the silly 
notion. They couldn&#39;t read minds or something. Not to mention that 
nobody saw me cloaked in the Yamasenken. I dreaded to use this 
hellish technique again but there was no other way. This had to end 
right now. By now I was sure Ranma had gotten to his senses and if 
not... Well, the so-called &quot;training&quot; under the shriveled old woman 
that reminded me too much of a certain someone for my liking had 
obviously taken its toll on him. He would either be too weak or too 
easy to influence to not see reason.
	It was a real shame. After all this years I had spent on 
making him a splendid heir to our school, fulfilling my part of the 
promise the boy got it into his head that he rather wanted to stay 
here with this - admittedly caring and at least adequate skilled - 
Amazon. Of course this was nothing personal against the girl and I 
probably would have even approved had the other thing not stood. I 
had promised Tendo-kun after all. Not too mention that living here 
amidst a society ruled by woman for longer than necessary compared to 
a nice, cozy dojo was just...
	Anyway. The boy would come to his senses or I would have to 
make him. He would thank me later. That much was for sure. After all 
I, as his father, should know what was best for him. And then we 
could finally return to Tokyo, join the schools and everything would 
be fine. Heck, with Ranma safely married I could finally see Nodoka-
chan again without that godforsaken promise over our heads...
	Kuso. Who was I fooling with that? Not even myself. My only 
son was a girl. Permanent. And the only chance for a cure obviously 
lay here but that would require him to stay faithful to the Amazon 
and... A real mess. How could the boy do something like that to me? 
Why couldn&#39;t he be more thankful and appreciate what his old man did 
for him? Why had I been so stupid to push him back in this cursed 
pool.
	Matte... That wasn&#39;t my... Hell, it WAS my fault. I couldn&#39;t 
even deny it myself. Not this time. For once there was no way of an 
escape with minimum loss. And I had managed to screw it all up. Now I 
could never go back to Nodoka or honor the promise with Tendo. I 
would forever be stuck here. There was no way to satisfy the two most 
important promises in my life.
	Shaking my head I rounded another corner finally spotting 
Ranma sitting on the front porch of the actually quite spacious 
house. It was dark, nearing midnight. Perfect. I knew that he and the 
Amazon had had a bit of a misunderstanding after Ranma vanished for 
awhile. Perfect opportunity. We could be out before someone even knew 
the boy wasn&#39;t in his room and then... then... No! I shouldn&#39;t think 
about that. There surely would be another way of curing his condition.
	I was so wrapped up in my thoughts that I had for a moment 
not kept a close eye on my surroundings and realized too late that I 
had relaxed my hold on the Yamasenken for a tiny moment. In that 
moment the redhead had moved with a speed I was totally incapable of 
comprehending. &quot;Forget it, Oyaji.&quot; Pain suddenly exploded all over my 
body as hundreds of blows smashed into me in the space of a few 
seconds. I tried to bring up my guard but the motions were too 
quick. &quot;Other than you I hold my promises. And I made one to Xian Pu 
that YOU won&#39;t make me break. This is my life and I intend to longer 
led it be ruled by your idiocy. Not. Anymore.&quot; As the final right 
look landed and I sailed through the sky soon after, I marveled at 
the irony of the statement because it was so frighteningly true. The 
one promise that I had sacrificed anything else for and the other one 
that I HAD to hold I could not fulfill and that just because Ranma 
wanted to fulfill his. In an odd sense I was a little proud. But only 
a little.
	Looking down I searched for a soft landing spot but came up 
empty. &quot;Err, this is going to hurt...&quot;

&lt;A few days later (Ranma)&gt;
&quot;Really, I don&#39;t believe the idiot. Trying to sneak in our room and 
snatch me!&quot; The statement was more one of humor than of anger. That 
had been about the, um... thirty-fifth&#39;s attempt of Oyaji to get me 
out of the village unseen. He was growing impatient and relentless, 
being trapped here with all the women around him. Of course he 
wouldn&#39;t be treated well, even if nobody knew of the curse situation, 
the fool never stopped to realize what I had awhile ago already. 
Society&#39;s prejudices that Amazons would mistreat their men was only 
true when you deserved it. I had seen many men here that were 
obviously quite happy with their lives here and had nothing to 
complain about.
	Of course that wasn&#39;t the real reason why the panda fool 
wanted out of here. Since finishing the Amaguriken training I had 
spent much more time with Xian Pu. Elder Kho Lon was now training us 
at the same time deeper in the art of chi manipulation and how to 
extract that power to use it for battle purpose. It was a good 
convenience that she had planned that for her heir anyway. And I 
could not deny that after that day in the mountains I felt more and 
more comfortable with the Amazon around. Not only out of comfort 
reasons alone anymore. No, I was beginning to fall for her. Plain and 
simple. I might not be ready to totally accept that yet but even 
thinking of her as my wife by their laws didn&#39;t automatically fluster 
me anymore.
	&quot;&lt;Yes, I mean. Even if he could get you two out, there would 
be a search party on you in no time.&gt;&quot; Xian Pu stopped in her step 
and turned towards me, a serious look suddenly on her face that I had 
learned to recognize in the past days. &quot;&lt;I am glad you feel that you 
have to stay.&gt; I know what she was talking about. It had just been 
four days ago when Oyaji - on Elder Kho Lon&#39;s inquiry actually - had 
begun teaching me the Forbidden Saotome Style that he had created and 
sealed because they became too dangerous. Surprisingly he agreed but 
soon I found out that he only wanted to show me the Yamasenken to 
slip out unnoticed. I had told him point blank that I wasn&#39;t planning 
on leaving here anytime soon. After Jusenkyo I had had finally 
enough. Ten years I had let him push me around and went along with 
all his stupid ideas. Not anymore. Not with this. Not because of the 
curse. I couldn&#39;t do it because of Xian Pu, that would surely break 
her heart.
	Closing the distance between us with a step, I gently reached 
out to touch her arm, making her look at me. It was a gift I had come 
to cherish. The ability for us to communicate with our eyes alone. 
For some reason there were never many words needed to let the other 
knew what they felt. I could try as much as I wanted, I wasn&#39;t able 
to emotionally shield myself from her. Too much had been shared 
already. &quot;&lt;I don&#39;t feel that I have to stay. I want to stay.&gt;&quot; My 
Chinese had become more fluent. It really was a matter of putting 
your heart into it. I could learn a language like a Martial Arts 
technique.
	Xian Pu reached up with her hand to touch my cheek and I 
relished in the feeling of the familiar warmth, beginning to spread 
through my body. Until now I had no idea if something would have come 
out of this moment. But of course, life couldn&#39;t just stop throwing 
its problems on me for a single moment of happiness. No, that would 
have been too much to ask.
	&quot;Saotome Ranma!&quot; A voice suddenly bellowed through the 
silence of the early morning village which snapped both of us out of 
the trance we had been in. &quot;I know you are here! Come out and fight 
me!&quot; I blinked, trying to locate the source of the definitely male 
voice. It was some distance away, somewhere from the main entrance. I 
looked at Xian Pu and upon her nod, we both took to the roofs and 
raced in the direction where I could take up an easily identifiable 
tingle of anger chi. A lot of anger and depression. Hmm, whoever 
could that be? Mu Tsu was out of the question. No one had spotted him 
since the day of our confrontation and I had the feeling that any 
harsh feelings between us were extinguished then. So who else could 
it be?

(Xian Pu)
Quickly making our way to the main entrance of the village Ranma and 
I soon found out the origin of the idiot that had interrupted our 
moment... Err, I mean issued a quite obvious challenge to my Airen 
for what reason ever. Crouching low on one of the higher roofs we had 
a good view on the figure standing INSIDE the gates that were 
apparently pushed open. Granted, we had not the most steadfast 
material here but anyone crafty enough to push their way through the 
heavy gates had to be given more than just a passing thought. And 
where were the guards? I didn&#39;t spot any which either meant the 
intruder had disposed of them, they had been slacking off or either 
had no intentions to make a move.
	The latter became more and more believable. Of course it 
could be because most of my sisters still didn&#39;t appreciate my 
Airen... or better my Airen with me, which might lead to believe that 
they had merely let the intruder pass out of their own animosity. 
That was a lot more farfetched though when anyone might have thought. 
An Amazon wouldn&#39;t abuse a position. Especially not a guard position. 
Looking at the figure in the middle of the entrance area though I 
think even I might have considered getting help before engaging a 
fight...
	The &quot;figure&quot; was only remotely human-like. What was before 
our very ideas was more like a creature out of legends, a horrible 
and twisted demon being from ancient myth. If someone did not 
consider the history and the proximity to certain mythical places of 
the area when this was almost believable. As it was what I saw only 
threw me for a moment before I realized that what I had here was just 
an unlucky - although incredible stupid - human being.
	&quot;Jusenkyo Curses mixed,&quot; I whispered to Ranma who stared a 
little bewildered at the creature. What I could make out from here 
was already a great variety. The lower half was entirely composed of 
four legs, obviously of a bull or a similar creature, giving him - I 
assumed - the impression of a minotaur. The rest did add to the 
effect. The upper body was human but covered in a variation of skin, 
some sort of armor and fur. His head was bald but actually had two 
bull horns sticking out of it and I would really not be surprised to 
see fangs - which was impossible to make out from here. What was 
really striking where the wings. I could not quite determine from 
what they might be but they didn&#39;t look like they could actually 
carry all the weight for long. If they could do it at all.
	&quot;&lt;Saotome!&gt;&quot; the figure bellowed again. It was a deep and 
rumbling voice. And anyone less than a warrior of our status it might 
have actually shaken to the core. So I just felt the tiniest bit 
uncomfortable. &quot;&lt;Come here and stop being a coward! Face my wrath 
like a man!&gt;&quot; The redhead flinched just the tiniest bit but I caught 
it. What was more worrying was the expression on her face though. A 
stubbornness I knew too well. No true warrior would take mocking like 
that lightly.
	&quot;Any idea who that is?&quot; I asked, eying the intruder with 
concern. He seemed ready to tear through the whole village to find my 
Airen if it was necessary. Ranma shook her head. &quot;&lt;Not the tiniest 
bit. So twisted as the guy is. I would be surprised if ANYONE could 
recognize him.&gt;&quot; Casting another glance downward she shrugged. &quot;&lt;Oh 
well. Stay here, I see what the baka wants,&gt;&quot; she said and was gone 
before I could stop her. For a moment I considered getting Great-
grandmother but my worry won that inner debate fast. Ranma might need 
help and surely someone would have informed the Elder by now or she 
probably knew already.
	So I watched with apprehension the happenings below.

(Ranma)
Dropping back down to ground level, I focused my chi much like Elder 
Kho Lon and Oyaji had taught me, trying to calm my nerves. It wasn&#39;t 
like I was afraid or nothing. However, with all those curses 
apparently blended together I would rather have this settled 
peacefully than facing whoever that was directly. Yet, judged from 
his whole stance and the sickly black-green chi that reminded me too 
much of myself lately. I had not much hope for a quick and peaceful 
resolution. This wasn&#39;t Mu Tsu. This was someone with a grudge 
against me for whatever reason that seemed to be more deeply anchored 
when the Amazon&#39;s blind love.
	&quot;Yo, buddy, I&#39;m here. So what do you want?&quot; I addressed 
the... being a little cocky, not wanting to show my concern about 
facing such a creature in battle. The distorted man glared at me with 
flashing eyes of silver - wolf eyes maybe - and snorted. &quot;Right. 
Hiding behind a woman. That&#39;s just like him...&quot; A spark of anger 
flared at me at the accusation and I forced myself not to rush in 
with an unplanned attack.
	Forcing down my emotions for the moment with the Soul of Ice 
that I had been practicing, I replied calmly: &quot;Look. I know those are 
obviously blend-in curses, so you can&#39;t be that dumb. I AM Saotome 
Ranma. So get over it and tell me what you want already.&quot; The man 
stared at me for awhile, obviously trying to find out if I was lying. 
I was a little taken aback at the cruel smile slowing creeping into 
his face and the mocking laughter and chuckles erupting like a deep 
rumbling sound. &quot;You... Ha ha, that&#39;s just too good. You are a 
GIRL!!! Aha ha ha...&quot; A Raishu Dan sailed centimeters over his head 
and exploded against one of the gate posts as I momentarily lost my 
temper.
	Calm. Calm and patient, I reminded myself. Right now I really 
wished I had practiced this more. &quot;Who. ARE. You?&quot; I managed to get 
out between gritted teeth. In an instant the facial expression on the 
stranger&#39;s face shifted from amused to one of boiling anger so 
intense that I forgot my own for the moment. His fists were clenched 
and his eyes drawn together to slits. &quot;You... don&#39;t... REMEMBER?!? 
After all what I&#39;ve been through. After all the damage you have done 
to my life, you simply don&#39;t even remember me?&quot; I took a step back as 
his green chi became almost obsidian black. I had barely any time to 
react. One moment the figure was standing in the middle of the 
entrance area and seething in anger, the next he had cupped his hands 
together, a swirling ball of green and black chi forming 
there... &quot;Ah, kuso...&quot; I mumbled, preparing for a quick jump as I 
calculated the attacks possible range and course... Course. I glanced 
over my shoulder and surely saw Xian Pu down from her surveillance 
place, Elder Kho Lon next to her. Somewhere up the rooftops I spotted 
Lhi Li... Great, got to stop him somehow or someone will get...
	&quot;SHI SHI HOUKODAN!&quot; Well, that much for stopping the baka. My 
eyes opened wide, not in fear but in concern for the few people I 
actually cared about. There was hardly a choice left as the massive 
beam of chi barreled in my direction. Calling up all my reserves I 
spun to face the blast, arms raised in a desperate attempt to lessen 
the damage...

(Xian Pu)
&quot;AIREN!&quot;
	It was only due to Great-grandmother holding me back that I 
didn&#39;t give into the sudden impulse in a dumb and vain attempt to do 
ANYTHING. So I could only watch in abject horror as the chi blast 
impacted with the in comparison fragile looking redhead with a loud 
boom. I had to shield my eyes, not from the exploding dark chi but 
from the strong gust of wind following the impact. Everything and 
everyone was silent for awhile as the dust began to settle and the 
remains fizzled out. Slowly the shadowy figure of a human being 
sporting a pigtail could be made out and as the air further cleared 
there was no doubting anymore that it was indeed Ranma. Bruised, 
slightly charred but very much alive, standing and... angry. And I 
mean not just angry. I mean ANGRY.
	I let go of the breath I had been holding for the infinite-
seeming few seconds between impact and the emerging of my Airen as 
Great-grandmother commented, &quot;Amazing...&quot; but then trailed off as one 
trained in chi manipulation - even one only beginning to - could see 
the faint orange-red glow that slowly whisked out of existence like a 
barrier that had taken the most of the damage. But that was 
impossible. Surely it was her aura reacting to her emotions... right? 
Because if not... Well, I didn&#39;t really want to further follow that 
train of thought.
	&quot;Alright, buddy,&quot; Ranma snarled, lowering his arms and 
glaring at the monstrosity that would just be another human being 
with a splash of hot water. Said being actually flinched a little 
from the intensity. &quot;We&#39;ll take that outside. NOW!&quot; Before her 
opponent could as much as react Ranma was already in his face, 
crossing the remaining distance like a blur and unleashing an 
Amaguriken at speed that - I could clearly see - even impressed Elder 
Kho Lon. The bestiality half-staggered, half-flew backwards from the 
concentrated punches but surprisingly seemed rather unimpressed. 
Regaining footing just outside of the main gates it dug its massive 
four feet in the ground and reared back to leash out with his massive 
wings. However, Ranma was already out of range, letting out not more 
than a slight grunt as one of the wings scratched her slightly before 
coming up in a guarded defenses stance parallel to the village walls.
	Great-grandmother, I and the small group of Amazons that had 
gathered to watch the battle with interest moved to follow but this 
time we made sure not to be in any position to get Ranma into trouble 
again. I had glimpsed some very approving reactions when my Airen had 
taken the blast that would have come right in our direction. And as 
much animosity that might still be there. Every Amazon would admire 
skill when they saw it and would not actively interfere with a duel. 
Ranma didn&#39;t know it but she had obviously gained herself a debt with 
a few ones right there. And THIS usually was a good thing.
	Both combaters had not moved from their positions, silently 
daring the other to make the first move. Finally Ranma let out an 
exasperated sigh that could be heard from our position. &quot;Fine, I give 
up. Who are you and what right do you have to barge in here and get 
innocents involved in whatever grudge you have with me?&quot; she called 
out, not relaxing her guard the slightest bit. The hybrid&#39;s - since 
that is what he technically was now - expression darkened visibly at 
his opponent&#39;s obvious failed attempts to recognize him. I wondered 
how my Airen could not recognize someone that dangerous and with such 
a big grudge against her. But I was about to find out surely.
	&quot;That&#39;s just so like you. First you run out of our duel and 
now you even forget my name!&quot; At Ranma&#39;s stupefied expression I could 
already smell the delusions, having been around Mu Tsu far too long 
not to see the signs when someone had a very vivid, egocentric 
imagination. Ranma muttered something that I couldn&#39;t catch from my 
position and the cursed male straightened up to all his pompous 
height. &quot;It&#39;s me Saotome. Hibiki Ryoga.&quot;
	The confusion didn&#39;t leave my Airen&#39;s face right away but 
when realization dawned in her eyes coupled with a rising 
chuckle. &quot;Ryoga! Man, whatever happened to you, old buddy?&quot; I 
cringed, being much too aware that even with her &quot;Mu Tsu de-
illusionist&quot; status my Airen still had the habit of... how do the 
outsiders say it, putting her foot in her mouth at more times when 
she liked herself.
	&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; the creature that once was Hibiki Ryougo roared 
and stopped on the ground with his massive hint legs sending a weak 
pulse over the ground. &quot;This is all YOUR fault!&quot; Ranma cocked her 
head, obviously unimpressed by his opponent&#39;s display of unrestrained 
fury. &quot;Oh, how so, old friend? I think if anyone has the right to be 
angry here it&#39;s me. After all you nearly got some people care about 
injured, not to mention part of their home leveled.&quot;
	&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; the Hibiki boy roared, tingles of green and black 
chi forming around him again. As he launched into his obviously 
flawed tale of how my Airen had managed to utterly destroy his life 
by stealing his bread - I barely contained the laughter at that -, 
running out of their duel - which I thought hard to believe - and 
eventually getting him cursed by luring him to Jusenkyo and other 
such nonsense, I could literally feel my Airen&#39;s emotions. There was 
that slight twitch she began to develop, the haunted look in her eyes 
warring with a bobbling volcanic heat of anger waiting to be released 
and not to mention the very concerning fact that with every word, 
every accusation her aura began to shift, growing thicker and darker. 
From sickly green until it became almost an obsidian black that was 
MUCH darker and thicker as her opponent&#39;s and even more worrying when 
her state upon arriving here.
	Every onlooker took more than one cautious step backwards but 
I remained rooted to the ground, captivated by the swirling pool of 
blue eyes that I could catch even over this distance, seeing the 
cauldron of feelings bubbling and battling each other. I wasn&#39;t quite 
sure who I was more worried about my Airen or the fool who was 
pouring out his delusional soul.
	But when the cursed male for the nth-time accused my Airen 
that she had no idea how it felt like, that she was still human and 
would not scare people... I swear the whole village could have heard 
the snap as whatever restrained the stored emotional trauma of the 
redhead cracked and finally broke. Then, THEN I really felt sorry for 
the Hibiki boy. Just a tiny bit...

(Ranma)
&quot;You made my life a living hell, Ranma! You have no idea through what 
hell I had to go!&quot; My face twitched ever so slightly at the words, 
images of several days ago forcing their way to the surface. They 
never were very far below, just in reach, ready to haunt me at any 
given moment. Just like now as the boy I had at one point considered 
as the closest friend I had since Ukyo launched into his abstruse 
tale.
	&quot;Day after day when we were in school you stole MY bread. Not 
enough you even mocked me countless times about it. As it wasn&#39;t 
enough when I finally arrived at our appointed duel after traveling 
through deserts, arctic wastelands and dangerous jungles alike YOU 
WERE NOT THERE!&quot; After three days, yes. I remembered. I had waited 
three days. For Ryoga to arrive in his own backyard. Up to here the 
whole thing was even amusing to a point. Really. I was well aware of 
the boy&#39;s legendary direction problem. That&#39;s why I waited three days 
before we had to finally move on to China. I actually wanted to wait 
even though I was near the boiling point of impatience the third day 
but Oyaji had dragged me along. I could feel the slightest bit of 
annoyance drawing out a bit of anger from the lost boy&#39;s ridiculous 
accusation but refused to react to the statement, more interested in 
how he happened to get all those curses.
	&quot;And then, THEN,&quot; Ryogo continued through gritted teeth and 
with the sort of hard breathing that suited his animalistic 
appearance just fine, &quot;I found out there you are.&quot; A dramatic 
pause. &quot;I wish I never had. I wish I never had followed you to China 
as you surely had planned me too, to this cursed place! See what you 
did to me, you coward! This humiliation, this perversity! People are 
scared of me, I can&#39;t even ask someone for directions this way 
because they run screaming! I have been hunted by at least eight 
different people thinking I was either a demon, a monster or just a 
fine prize for their collection! And it&#39;s all your fault, Ranma!&quot;
	I could feel it now. The beginning of a slow rumble at the 
start of Ryoga&#39;s tirade had turned into an uproar of rolling thunder 
barreling its way closer and closer to the surface. I could feel the 
tendrils of green and black, the concerning waves of extreme negative 
and dangerous chi but I didn&#39;t care. Not now, not at all. Memories 
flashed before my eyes. Memories of the first time breaking the 
surface as a girl. Memories of learning about the locked curse after 
the second submerge. The hollowness and emptiness as I realized that 
my last glimmer of hope had obviously been thrashed when I had to 
bail out Oyaji once again.
	&quot;You have no idea what I had to go through. YOU at least 
still can be human! You have no idea what this agony feels like! 
You...&quot; Ryoga stopped mid-sentence when my head snapped up and my 
eyes locked on his cursed ones. I imagined they must have looked like 
the very mother of a storm was brewing there and that is what felt 
like. Pain, depression, loneliness, humiliation, shattered pride and 
dreams, loathing and an all-out consuming fury had finally penetrated 
the thin layer of protection that had kept them in since that day. 
They had been pushed back a little over the last days. Ignored and 
somewhat eased. But never gone. Never really not threatening to burst 
forward at any moment. And that moment had come. Now. Here. 
Inevitable.
	&quot;Ryoga,&quot; I spoke in a voice that was near a whisper but yet 
as clear if I had shouted it from atop the mountains. A voice that 
any other point would have even shaken me to my bones. &quot;You are still 
the same overgrown child as before.&quot; As expected the Lost Boy 
immediately went to retort, an angry scowl passing over his inhuman 
features but he never managed more than opening his mouth. &quot;You come 
here and accuse me of being responsible for your misery? You tell me 
that I stole your bread and ran out on our duel when all I did was 
being a bit quicker at the usual lunch brawls and even shared it with 
you, when all I did was getting you to school and home EVERY FREAKING 
DAY because you wouldn&#39;t find it on your own, when all I did was 
waiting THREE FUCKING DAYS for you to arrive IN YOUR OWN BACKYARD.&quot;
	My voice had only slowly risen but the intensity of my 
emotional turmoil surely had tripled. I let it all come. Not at the 
least concerned with my own health or that of anyone or anything 
around me. By now tiny almost electrical discharges of chi crawled 
and sparked over my skin as waves of emotions traveled down into my 
palms.
	&quot;And if that isn&#39;t enough. You were stupid enough to follow 
me to Jusenkyo and tell me it was my fault that you fell into half 
the pools available?&quot; I was amazed at that point how level I could 
hold my voice but it was near the cracking point. &quot;You tell me I have 
no idea how that feels like? You tell me I am better off because I&#39;m 
still human all the time? I tell you something, Ryoga, OLD buddy...&quot;
	The guide&#39;s words began ringing in my ears as I let every 
last ounce of devastation and terror that I felt that moment and 
still did rush out of from wherever it came. I couldn&#39;t stop anymore. 
I didn&#39;t want to stop anymore. It HAD TO come out. Everything. &quot;At 
least you still can be YOURSELF half the time! You tell me, you have 
it bad? Try living as the total opposite you have been raised for in 
over ten years WITHOUT A WAY TO CHANGE BACK! You stupid baka are 
coming here, demanding revenge from your self-inflicted stupidity, 
almost trash an entire village with your delusions and want to blame 
ME?!?&quot;
	At this point my voice dropped back to the low, chilling 
whisper again: &quot;Ryoga, you really are a pitiful creature. Do you see 
me moping around, unleashing my anger at anything in sight? Hell, I 
even HAVE someone to blame for. But do you see me complaining? No, 
because I deal with my problems and not go around accusing people. 
No, Ryoga...&quot;
	Ryoga had not moved at all since I begun, various degree of 
his own anger flashing in his face and his own chi rising at the same 
time. But it was half-hearted, not even a sliver compared to the 
power coursing through me right now. And he looked FRIGHTENED now. 
His eyes were wide with shock and a dawning realization turning into 
horror as I cupped my hands the darkish chi crackling, twisting and 
GROWLING like a predator just waiting to be unleashed on its helpless 
prey. But for me it was more. For me it was all the negativity that 
was stored up since Jusenkyo and even further before. It was all that 
I hated about my life, that I hated to endure and put up with every 
day traveling with Oyaji, it was the humiliation and destructiveness 
of getting stuck in this body. It was, plain and simple, alive.
	You have ABSOULTELY NO IDEA what this feels like!&quot;
	It wanted to be free and gone from its containment.
	I felt like I would burst any moment as I drew back with my 
cupped hands much like Ryoga had before. The enormous gathering of 
chi was unbearable to control.
	And I was much to happy to oblige its wishes.
	&quot;SHI SHI HOUKODAN!&quot;
	The echo as my frantic opponent called out his own attack was 
drowned out by the thunderous roar I let loose with my own version. 
The beam of thick blackness only remotely sporting traces of green in 
it was at least four times bigger in height and width than Ryoga&#39;s 
and overpowered his like an insect trying to wrestle with an 
elephant. I felt the rush of emotions as they filtered out of my very 
core like a cascade, a river that broke through a dam, finally 
released and free to follow its natural flow. If a thunderbolt had 
struck right between us I hardly believed it would have been heard as 
the chi blast crashed into Ryoga, practically swallowing him 
completely for a moment before lifting the enormous figure despite 
all his struggles from his feet and flinging him through the air into 
a near formation of rocks, bringing those to collapse on top of him.
	As the last bit of chi drained away from my body, not only a 
thick silence had settled over the area - to a point that even nature 
itself was obviously holding her breath - but also a sense of deep 
calm, a lasting refreshing and welcoming sense of serenity settled in 
my heart. Right there all that dark emotions that I had put into the 
chi blast had been. It was strange but at the same time somewhat 
logical. Ryoga always was someone who let depression rule his life. 
Every challenge, every little thing that didn&#39;t go his way was viewed 
as the epitome of the very life crisis. He always had found a way to 
direct his anger and own problems at others, never able to see his 
own flaws. And therefore this chi attack - wherever the baka had 
managed to pick it up - was totally suited for him. He never really 
run out of this emotions.
	In my case, however, I usually mastered the occasional bump 
in the road, the next stupidity thrown as a so-called &quot;challenge&quot; 
from Oyaji in my way with all the confidence that I had ever felt 
before Jusenkyo. That had been taken away then and all the loneliness 
and aggravation that had been build up over the years had mixed with 
fury and loathing. Unlike Ryoga I had kept it in, even to a point 
where I would have chosen my own death over the very close 
possibility of madness. All of this, all this negative chi, had been 
brought out by Ryoga and released in one great eruption so strong 
that it didn&#39;t leave anything behind anymore.
	When I thought about the curse right now I still felt 
repulsion and a distaste at the concept and Oyaji but it didn&#39;t feel 
horribly anymore. And that was mostly thanks to Xian Pu I realized 
with a bit of surprise. She had never given me the feeling of being 
anything less than myself. She hadn&#39;t reminded me once that I was not 
what I had been born as. For her I was merely myself. The person 
behind the gender. A broken person maybe, but the person, not the 
gender. I had known it all along. The lengths she had gone just too 
cure my soul, not my curse. That wall of darkness and negative 
emotions I had subconsciously build and piled up around me had 
prevented me from REALLY seeing it. Now everything was bathed in a 
crystal clarity that was nothing short of refreshing.
	The sound of rocks being pushed apart brought me back to 
reality, the sudden calmness never leaving me though. To my mild 
astonishment Ryoga was already pushing his way out of his 
rocky &quot;grave&quot;. Alright with that built and all the layers of 
protection the curses had to provide I had been sure that he wouldn&#39;t 
really been dead or something. In the back of my conscious I had 
known that he was going to survive it. A sorry fool he might be but I 
didn&#39;t wish him death. No, he wasn&#39;t dead. Just badly scarred, his 
skin and fur almost to the point of blackening from the energy of the 
chi blast, one eye was swollen red and one of that horns was almost 
broken off, hanging a little limply off to the side, the wings looked 
nearly crushed by the sudden weight of the burial.
	&quot;I&#39;ll... never... forgive you...!&quot; the pitiful creature that 
was even further away from resembling a human being pressed out. I 
could only shake my head, not even bothering to take a proper 
fighting stance. &quot;You are pathetic, Ryoga. Still the same dumb 
blockhead as before.&quot;
	Of course that statement only helped to deepen the 
unrestrained fury but that was just what I wanted. I was tired of 
this. I had the suspicion that in his cursed form Ryoga could go 
several rounds, much longer than any normal human being should. Even 
though I was not afraid of that, with all the training I had endured 
the last days, the baka had drawn out enough hatred and anger for one 
day. At a level I was almost thankful for it. Still you never knew 
what he could destroy in his blind rage, so I better should put a 
stop to this. Not to mention that this was a perfect opportunity for 
a real test...
	Clearing my mind, I found it amazingly easy to access the 
Soul of Ice as Ryoga lunged forward with a snarl of anger. With my 
mind clear of any such notions for the first time in a very long time 
I slowly began to draw my opponent in the appropriate pattern.

(Xian Pu)
&quot;Airen...&quot; I whispered the word this time, still unmoving, still 
rooted solely to the one spot I had been spending the whole time on. 
A trickle of fear that I stubbornly refused to admit to as anything 
more than rightful concern had settled somewhere deep inside of me 
and my heart ached at the soul-shattering cry of release that called 
out the chi blast. It was like the death cry of a deity. Bone-
chilling and frighteningly unearthly. There was so much pain. So much 
bare, unprotected pain... I had seen it in her eyes time and time 
again but seeing it manifest in such a terrible force...
	No, it wasn&#39;t the power that had concerned me, not even the 
possible lethal consequences for the other cursed male, not even 
possible backlashes. What really scared me for several, terrible long 
seconds was the fear that the dark emotions had not only been 
unleashed in the enormous chi blast but also had taken over and most 
likely destroyed Ranma&#39;s sanity. For that infinite, shocking moment I 
feared for her very life.
	But... When the volcanic eruption had died down what I saw in 
the blue eyes of my Airen clearly - even over the distance - was 
nothing short of stunning. The deep serenity, the utter relieve as if 
all the heavy weight of her fate had just been taken from her 
shoulders was filling me with a warmth I could not quite define. Her 
aura was totally clear of any traces even coming near to a depression 
green. There was even the slightest trickle of red.
	When moments later her opponent had yet again risen and was 
ready to resume the battle my concern had faded into the barely 
noticeable areas. There was that certain... gleam in the redhead&#39;s 
eyes. That twinkle when you know you had the upper head, when you 
knew you would win, that sort of expression that spoke of how much 
you ENJOYED the fight.
	As Ranma&#39;s aura sprung up into a deep, cold blue to meet 
Ryoga&#39;s fiery, angry one my only concern was a slight worry. &quot;Is she 
ready for this,&quot; I asked Great-grandmother without taking my eyes 
from the form of my Airen who weaved around her opponent&#39;s attacks 
with an almost mocking ease, drawing him with every step deeper into 
the spiral. It was aggravating Ryoga even further, that was clearly 
obvious. He tried to constantly hit Ranma with anything possible. His 
massive head, the slightly torn wings, the remaining healthy horn or 
simply a vain attempt of running his foe over, nothing seemed to even 
come remotely close to touch my Airen as she stayed just the 
necessary bit out of reach with Amaguriken-fueled reaction speed.
	&quot;Oh, Son-in-law knows what he is doing. From what I saw he 
has the basics down and the Soul of Ice is... perfect.&quot; I nodded, 
agreeing silently on the subject. The release of chi had obviously 
carried away all the blockades and so Ranma was able to even break 
that last barrier to access the cold chi technique that she never had 
seemed to really master before. There was no trace of even a tiny 
spark.
	&quot;&lt;Fight back damn it!&gt;&quot; Ryoga let loose with a cross between 
a bellow and roar as he swung his fist blindly at Ranma who was now 
only a few steps away from completing the spiral. I had finally 
moved, stepping closer to the wall, bracing myself for the inevitable 
while most of the other Amazons had already scrambled for cover, 
knowing very well what was coming.
	&quot;&lt;You know, Ryoga, I think I even have to thank you,&gt;&quot; I 
could hear my Airen&#39;s voice over the roar of clashing chi as the two 
combatants arrived in the center of the spiral. &quot;&lt;I really feel 
better now.&gt;&quot; Her opponent was too far gone to let go of his anger, 
even when confusion crossed his features. And so he was doomed.
	&quot;HIRYU SHOTEN HA!&quot;
	The redhead thrust her fist upwards but the blow didn&#39;t even 
manage to strike her opponent in his jaw as it would have otherwise 
as the cold and hot chi finally merged and erupted outwards into an 
enormous tornado that ascended up to the heavens as the very 
incarnation of an angry dragon. I had seen the technique before, 
several times. I had witnessed Great-grandmother demonstrated to the 
youngest the wonders and power of Amazon law, I had seen it used in 
real battles before... However, the sheer amount of chi involved in 
this confrontation was actually frightening to a point. And so, it 
was no real surprise that the foundation of the village began to 
rattle and the very earth to shake as the Dragon finally manifested.
	Ryoga by now barely was a blur, tossed around in high speed 
winds that threatened to pull him apart in every direction at once. 
His wings were even less beneficial as they were before and at one 
point actually ripped apart - which had to hurt like hell I could 
imagine. The scream that had began to escape from his lips as the 
wind picked him up could not be heard over the roaring anymore.
	I had a hard time staying upright but my training allowed me 
to withstand the lashing wind that was generated by the enormous 
spiral in the middle of the field in front of the village and it was 
over more quickly than I had suspected. As the storm began to subside 
the near-shredded figure in the air stayed there for awhile before 
crashing down like a stone, causing a middle-sized crater upon 
impact. My main focus was on Ranma though. The redheaded Martial 
Artist stood in the center, the eye of the storm with her arm and 
fist still raised to the sky in a... yes, you could actually say 
relaxed pose. Unyielding and not wavering the slightest, completely 
still. You could have mistaken her for the statue of a victorious 
Amazon posing. I couldn&#39;t tear my eyes away and even had to force 
myself to move. I knew it wasn&#39;t long before the stress and 
exhaustion from the battle settled in, now that the adrenalin was 
gone. She could appear as tough as she wanted, my Airen was only 
human herself... Though after that performance there could be other 
opinions...
	I reached Ranma just at the moment her knees gave way 
underneath her, allowing me to catch her just in time. While I 
lowered the girl carefully to the ground, not minding her clinging 
reflexively to me, I noticed that a few tremors shook her otherwise 
limb body. Probably aftereffects from the overexertion of her chi 
reserves. &quot;Airen, alright?&quot; I asked rather rhetorically, sticking to 
still rather broken Japanese to make it a little easier for the girl 
after that ordeal. Her gaze directed at me was a little unsettling 
and I wondered what was going through her mind right now. From what I 
caught from the verbal exchange he had considered this Ryoga as close 
a friend as one could make while constantly traveling. It must have 
hurt.
	However, that look was not quite about pain. I think the very 
ability to feel that had been completely drained for the moment 
through the chi blast. No, Ranma&#39;s eyes were soft and laced with a 
certain understanding that I wasn&#39;t quite sure what to make off. 
Looking down where I had gripped her hand, I could see my Airen 
squeezing my own slightly before catching my eyes again. &quot;Arigato.&quot; 
The puzzlement must have shown in my face since I wasn&#39;t sure what 
exactly she was thanking me for. Before I could ask the question 
though the answer was already given. &quot;For being yourself and... for 
loving ME.&quot;
	For a moment I wasn&#39;t quite sure whether to laugh or cry. 
Finally I settled for a hopefully reassuring and thankful smile. 
Brushing through some, now unruly, red hair I whispered: &quot;Always. But 
only for you.&quot;

(Ranma)
The minutes went by as the sun slowly rose over the mountain tops 
surrounding the small secluded village lying peaceful in slumber of 
pre-dawn. Funny. That somehow reminded of the first morning I spent 
up here. On the roof of the house I had called home for the last 
weeks. It had been weeks already. Weeks of training, training and 
dealing. Dealing with the horrible truth of the fate that had 
befallen me. Was it really that horrible? I truly didn&#39;t KNOW 
anymore. Sure, it hurt. Sure, it robbed me off what I really was. Or 
did it? Everything was much clearer this morning. However, this 
clarity also made it more confusing. Pretty pathetic, right?
	One thing was foremost on my mind. Xian Pu. The lavender-
haired Amazon that had so sacrificially taken me in and showed 
nothing but care and compassion for me ever since. With her I never 
REALLY felt like I was some stranger, some twisted mirror 
impersonating all that was me but the body. I never really felt like 
I even had to be what I was all my life. Strong. Manly. Proud. 
Confident. A fine example of Martial Artist... without a friend. She 
had been this friend. Unconditional and patient. And for the first 
time since leaving home and Okaasan - which I had only the vague 
memories of a child of - I felt loved. I felt important. Not the 
Martial Artist. Not my skill. Not my superiority. ME.
	And had I ever paid it back?
	If I never fell into that pool I might have never met her. If 
I never fell into this pool twice I might have never KNOWN her. After 
all it would have been temporary. Nothing Saotome Ranma couldn&#39;t 
master, right? Had I staid and awaited the killing blow that day? No. 
I would probably have given in and run as Oyaji had tried to. And the 
realization of this. Of what life would have turned out then, without 
the smiling, cheerful and infectious girl in my life... It made me 
shudder just to think about it. At least I would have lost the chance 
of the best friend I had since Ucchan, at best... The at best became 
more and more reality, yet I was not QUITE ready to admit to it 
myself. I knew she wanted me to but she wanted me also to be true to 
myself. That&#39;s not always easy with a life such as mine.
	Ryoga had left, probably gotten himself lost several times 
trying to find a way back to Jusenkyo - which according to Elder Kho 
Lon was magically nearly impossible once you were cursed. Of course I 
had tried talking to him when he came to. The anger was far gone by 
then and as I said just before igniting the Dragon. In an ironic way 
I was even thankful for him showing up when he did. He provided me 
with just the way and opportunity to for once in my life let go of 
the pent-up emotions. It had felt so terribly good. Still did.
	Ryoga hadn&#39;t spared me much more than a glance, a few mumbled 
words that were supposed to resemble anger and then had dragged 
himself up and away, grudgingly swearing he would find a way for 
revenge. I wanted to pity him, I wanted to just ignore it and shrug 
it of as a hopeless case... Just that... I had really once considered 
him a friend. A friend I had sacrificed much of my time for and that 
for the life of me I just couldn&#39;t understand anymore.
	&quot;&lt;Thinking doesn&#39;t make it easier, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;&gt; I turned my 
head slightly, not all surprised, actually rather welcoming the arm 
over my shoulders and the girl sliding next to me. Another funny 
thing. A few weeks ago the very idea of having a girl so close to me 
and actually enjoying the feeling would have been mind-boggling for 
me. It was not like I was as shy as say... Ryoga. But in my opinion 
my life didn&#39;t have time for girls, romance and stuff in it yet. I 
had viewed the prospect as a distraction from the Art. And now. Now I 
was sitting on a rooftop AS a girl with another comfortingly snuggled 
up next to me and I was enjoying it. Not even that but I had found it 
fascinatingly astonishing that her mere presence could even sharpen 
my focus much more than any meditation or any training method. Oyaji 
would have been disgusted for sure but THAT was only one more point 
why I just had to enjoy it.
	I didn&#39;t say anything, feeling completely at ease for once as 
I let my head rest against her shoulder, a soft morning breeze 
carrying the smell of dew washing over us. Xian Pu wouldn&#39;t think any 
less of me. Oyaji might say such actions were a weakness but I had 
learned otherwise in the last weeks. There was nothing wrong with 
letting go once in awhile. If you didn&#39;t the stress could consume 
you. And here, with her, I felt safe. Safe, understood and loved. 
Nobody would see or know and to her it didn&#39;t matter.
	&quot;&lt;When Mu Tsu almost managed to... kill... Lhi Li...&gt;&quot; Xian 
Pu&#39;s voice faltered slightly then continued softly, &quot;&lt;I felt like I 
lost a part of me. It might not be the same as with Ryoga and you 
since we knew each other ever since we were little but I can 
understand, really. I am glad you made him see that.&gt;&quot; She trailed 
off as my eyes rested on hers. She had never talked about Lhi Li or 
openly admitted anything about that time. There was a lot of dulled 
pain and heartache in her voice but her eyes spoke enough only if you 
couldn&#39;t hear it.
	&quot;Yeah,&quot; I snorted, not really wanting to, but unable to stop 
myself, &quot;a shame I couldn&#39;t do something for myself just ONCE.&quot; A 
tiny smile crept into my Amazon wife&#39;s face which I found a little 
unnerving since I didn&#39;t think it was quite appropriate. &quot;But you 
did. Yesterday you DID.&quot; Her gaze was intense and I felt myself 
swallowing a sudden lump in my throat.  Yes, I did, didn&#39;t I. I had 
finally managed to rebel against the one thing that I had never dared 
to before. Against myself. Myself and all the dark aspect I had 
simply allowed to be there because I was afraid to face them. And as 
I already stated. It felt good.
	Reacting on instinct alone I first broke out in a broad grin, 
then leaned up boldly to kiss Xian Pu briefly on the lips. &quot;Arigato. 
What would I do without you, hmm?&quot; I felt myself actually enjoying 
the mischievous feeling that spread through me upon her rather 
stunned and flustered expression. I knew, of course, that this had 
been the first time I had initiated any sort of romantic contact.
	My eyes twinkled a little as I stood up and smiled down at 
her. &quot;Ready for some sparring?&quot;

(Xian Pu)
It was like a ritual of sorts. Morning sparring I mean. Even in the 
days where Ranma had undergone the Amaguriken training we had 
regularly done that. For one who had it drilled into him since six 
that girls were weak and an honorable man wouldn&#39;t fight them to do 
that, I can tell that I felt quite honored. I knew she was holding 
back and that it was more training for me than for her but at the 
same time I think it was her way of expressing gratitude, her way of 
showing the feelings she had kept inside for so long. There was so 
much one could read in body language, especially in the emotional 
twister that was a good spar or battle. You always showed something. 
Control, anger, determination, calm... Whatever it was even though 
you ought to keep your emotions in check in a way you were terrible 
unguarded in other ways. At least for one who knew what to look for.
	I moved my head to the left at the last moment, anticipating 
the feint and countering with an open-palm strike that Ranma managed 
to block with astonishing speed, somehow managing to reverse her 
sudden grip in the blink of an eye to throw me over. Anticipating the 
move I readjusted my feet and instead slid forward between, bringing 
my feet up quickly around her neck and pulling fast, flipping her 
over and myself on top of her, effectively pinning the redhead to the 
ground.
	I grinned down at her, a little smugness showing. And there 
was a sparkle in her eyes I hadn&#39;t seen before yesterday. A gleam of 
excitement that marked the true joy of a fight. I was startled for a 
brief but devastating moment by the dazzling smile sent my way and 
found myself sailing through the air a moment later.
	Flipping over I managed to land on my feet and spinning 
around to face the girl immediately. I barely had a moment to bring 
up my guard as a half-hearted Amaguriken kept me busy for several 
seconds before the barrage finally subsided... just to receive a kick 
that nearly swept away my legs had I not jumped at the last possible 
moment. I was totally baffled when Ranma shot up from her position 
barely finishing the leg sweep, meeting me in mid-air. Surprised as I 
was it was me this time that found herself pinned down by a grinning 
redhead.
	I made no immediate move to get her off me, instead watching 
the sheer happiness sparkling in the blue eyes, the unrestrained 
feelings not afraid to be seen, the silent laughter and quiet 
amusement - not maliciously - at my vain attempts to get the upper 
hand. The unguarded and honest gratitude boring into my heart and 
leaving a warmth there that burned away all the years of loneliness. 
Goodness, she was BEAUTIFUL. I knew there was a male face and body 
hiding underneath but that really wasn&#39;t an issue right now. This 
wasn&#39;t about male or female but about the natural beauty that came 
from inside. There was NO way that her male form would lack this 
quality.
	&quot;I love you,&quot; I breathed out with a sudden need to just kiss 
her and I did just that. The spar all but forgotten for a single 
moment as I put everything I just felt into the contact. The joy of 
seeing my Airen so ALIVE. As the kiss drew on I got a sudden 
mischievous thought. Slowly I worked my hands free from their 
entrapment, preparing just for the right moment to...
	I blinked as Ranma pulled away, her face slightly flushed but 
not at all distracted. As proof she had just caught my wrists again 
and looked down at me with a smug smile. &quot;&lt;Going anywhere so soon?&gt;&quot; 
Again she caught me off guard, just like before on the roof, leaning 
in to give me another light kiss before finally standing up. For a 
long moment I didn&#39;t even notice the outstretched hand and the 
gentleness in the redhead&#39;s features as she looked down at me.
	Blinking several times I managed to bring my suddenly 
alarming high heart rate under control, taking the offered hand and - 
with a hidden smile - tugged on it with enough force to bring Ranma 
off-balance once more. But again she was that tad bit quicker and 
instead pulled me up with sudden strength, flat against her slightly 
smaller form. As our eyes locked and we didn&#39;t move for a few moments 
I suddenly realized something else about our morning ritual. It was 
subtle. But it seemed we had added a certain amount of flirting...

&lt;Several days later&gt;
The confrontation of Ranma and Ryoga had been the newest top topic of 
the rumor mill around the village. There only had been a handful 
actually present and stories varied from ridiculous exaggeration to 
equally understatements. One thing was for sure though. Ranma had 
earned herself a huge amount of respect. That lead to most of my 
tribal sisters thinking twice before making a comment about me or us 
in general. Of course all good had a downside somewhere and so 
challenges had actually increased instead of decreased. It seemed my 
Airen - despite of no one knowing her true gender - was quite wanted 
all of a sudden...
	A few days ago that development would have been a course of 
concern. Not that I actually thought someone could beat her but... 
Well, that wouldn&#39;t have stopped me from worrying. However, her words 
after the battle had calmed my fears and made it once and for all 
clear that I DID love her. Whether or not the feelings were returned, 
her gratitude for a moment had been soothing to my lonely soul. 
Someone was thankful for ME, being there and caring. The fact that it 
was Ranma was only serving to make me feel that much better about it.
	&quot;&lt;Here you are.&gt;&quot; I didn&#39;t jump when the soft, familiar voice 
spoke from behind me but turned in the embrace suddenly enfolding me 
from behind. The redheaded girl slid down next to me against the 
outer wall around the village and I didn&#39;t hesitate to snuggle 
closer. It had become a natural thing and wasn&#39;t solely comfort 
anymore but quickly turning into genuine affection from both sides. 
For the moment it didn&#39;t really matter that Ranma had yet to voice a 
declaration. Her actions as of late made me confident though that it 
was merely a matter of time now. What had begun as a compassionate 
relationship had developed into something bigger and my Airen was no 
fool not to notice.
	&quot;Sorry, I needed to get out for awhile.&quot; Usually by now we 
would be well in our morning sparring session. Ranma&#39;s father had 
once or twice tried to butt in, thinking that the part was his 
right... After a few beatings from both of us he quickly relented. To 
be honest the fat male had obviously given in to his fate after Ranma 
had trashed him royally after another attempt to escape his &quot;prison&quot; -
 or whatever the idiot might think of my village.
	&quot;No problem. I need to clear my mind anyway for later,&quot; Ranma 
replied, switching to Mandarin. She had become much better in my 
language than I in hers. But it didn&#39;t seem to bother her. After all 
not all Amazons even understood Japanese therefore this way it was 
better anyway. &quot;Are you going to tell me what you are doing up there 
one day?&quot; I asked. It was the same routine every morning since the 
Ryoga incident and Ranma&#39;s mastering of the Dragon. Great-grandmother 
had all but acknowledged that at her current level she couldn&#39;t teach 
my Airen anything more but that she wasn&#39;t ready for obtaining the 
cure yet. I actually had a good idea what the cure was about and what 
it involved but was sworn to secrecy over the whole matter. Therefore 
Great-grandmother&#39;s advise was simple. Perfecting the skills my Airen 
had learned and that she did. Venturing out into the mountains every 
morning at dawn for several hours.
	&quot;You&#39;ll see soon,&quot; Ranma said and leaned to kiss me softly 
before standing up. &quot;I think I&#39;m almost on the verge of a 
breakthrough.&quot; And with that she was already gone while I still 
touched my lips with what surely had to be a rather silly smile 
plastered on my face.

(Ranma)
Breaking out of the rhythm at the last possible second I released the 
thrashing elements from the slightly but critically important off-
balance position. As if on cue a sharp wind began to rise and pulled 
me up into the air. Compared to the treatment Ryoga had gotten though 
this was a gentle breeze, a not even for an average person dangerous 
wind. That was first due to my unwillingness to hurt my training 
partner and second due to said training partner&#39;s rather low anger 
chi that was laced with no intention whatsoever to cause lethal harm -
 an essential part for a successful Dragon. We had found a way past 
that luckily.
	Concentrating on the task I focused all my concentration into 
totally clearing my mind, suppressing any usage of my own chi in the 
process. Then I brought my hands back, cupped in a position similar 
for a chi blast. Reaching out with my senses I let myself become one 
with the onslaught of massive, if not gigantic, chi around me and 
taped into it. The whole thing took barely a few seconds from start 
to finish but that was okay. If I managed this quick now, in a real 
battle it could be very beneficial and most likely life-saving.
	For a moment I struggled to control the chaotic chi of heat 
and cold that I kept pulling in as the swirling focus link in form of 
a slowly growing sphere tried to continuously lash out. Being faced 
with the full power of a nearly - or so Elder Kho Lon had said - 
Perfect Shi Shi Houkodan and still alive, this was child&#39;s play 
compared to the physical and mental strain. Although a real battle 
use might as well come close.
	Grunting slightly in annoyance at the stubborn chi I finally 
stabilized the link. Waiting for just the right moment, that being 
right above the eye of the tiny tornado I let the gathered chi ball 
go, pointing it downward. As expected the backlash worked like a 
boost and soon I found myself traveling down the spiral&#39;s center with 
reckless speed and all the gathered chi following in a concentrated 
beam of pure chi formed into one - admittedly rather thin - blast. 
The rocky surface shook slightly as the chi blast struck its target 
and I swayed to the left at the last moment to avoid a frontal 
collision as a temporary thick cloud enveloped my training partner.
	For a moment I had to struggle for breath. The exertion was 
not really straining but the loss of own chi involved in even 
igniting just such a small spiral was... not pleasant. And I had to 
keep my own levels suppressed at the same time as accessing the Soul 
of Ice. Glancing over at the girl on the ground, panting heavily I 
thought I was probably much better off than my training partner. Not 
that she would admit weakness openly. She was an Amazon despite many 
contradicting traits and such would never do that in a situation of 
battle. As much as I wouldn&#39;t, I guess.
	&quot;You alright, Lily?&quot; I asked my mutual if rather unexpected 
training partner concerned. I had chosen to alter the pronunciation 
on her name in fashion most outsiders would do if not exposed to the 
native language day by day. There really was not much of a difference 
and I liked to think of that as sort of a nickname for the girl I had 
come to consider as a friend.
	&quot;Yeah sure. Did it work? Did you get everything?&quot; I broke 
into a broad smile, nodding vigorously as I helped her to a standing 
position. &quot;It was merely a matter of forcing the connection between 
the focus and the rest too much, I guess.&quot; I shrugged and then 
grinned with amusement. &quot;Boy. will the Old Ghoul be surprised if she 
sees this.&quot; Lhi Li nodded with a gentle smile. She really had a calm 
and warm nature and even though she could very well develop a fighter 
spirit as proudly as any Amazon if necessary she was not much of a 
warrior. Her movements were much more graceful and adapted for 
dancing and lacked the purpose and subtlety of readiness for an 
immediate attack at any moment. I suppose though she could give 
anyone a run for their money in points of agility. I had to know 
after sparring with her for a few days straight.
	&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure the Elder will be impressed. I doubt anyone 
ever came up with a counter for the Dragon in such a... unsuspecting 
manner,&quot; she commented, staring at me strangely for a moment. &quot;You 
seem awfully cheery this morning though. More when I ever saw you. 
Anything particular happened that you want to tell me?&quot; I blushed at 
the inquiring gaze, laced with mischievous amusement. That&#39;s one of 
the many things you had to put up with her. A ridiculous amount of 
teasing. Yet I knew most of the question going into this direction 
were concern for Xian Pu.
	I turned away, trying to hide the coloring and looked down 
onto the land below. &quot;Don&#39;t forget that most of the technique was 
your idea.&quot; Which was true. The initial prospect had been brought up 
by her as we discussed possible ways of &quot;perfecting&quot; my skills as 
Elder Kho Lon had called it. Blinking shortly I gave a sigh that was 
not really weary or depressed. &quot;And yes, I feel a lot better 
actually. I... I thought a lot lately and I think... I think I&#39;m 
ready.&quot; There wasn&#39;t really a point in elaborating further, Lhi Li 
knew exactly what I was talking about. So as I turned around to gauge 
her reaction I had trouble keeping my balance in what Xian Pu had 
explained was simply known as the truly terribly Amazon technique. 
The dreaded Amazon Glomp.
	&quot;This is wonderful. I&#39;m so happy. Domo arigato... &#39;Neechan.&quot; 
I was not much surprised but a little startled as the fierceness and 
manner of her reaction. I guess at a level I had always thought that 
I was, after all, a rival to Lhi Li. Yet she never acted like it. I 
think for her, she and Xian Pu were history and all she wanted now 
was for my Amazon wife to be happy. Her approval was something I 
valued even in the days when I was totally unsure of that marriage 
thing.
	She called me &#39;Neesan too. Despite being taller and emotional 
much more stable and mature than me, Lhi Li WAS younger. And there 
had been a genuine affection developing between us that I could not 
deny but... &#39;NEESAN? It wasn&#39;t really the female implications in the 
statement but the prospect of something having me called sibling with 
a certain amount of... admiration? Woah... That was something I had 
to get used to. If it helped bringing her and Xian Pu closer again - 
on a platonic basis - it would surely be worth it. And having someone 
think of me as such close relation was... warming to put it nicely.
	Before I could really comment I felt Lhi Li suddenly stiffen 
and squeezing just a tiny bit more before stepping back, her face 
stricken and if I hadn&#39;t thought it to be ridiculous actually white 
like a ghost. &quot;Nani? Lily, you okay?&quot; She just pointed over my 
shoulder in response, her mouth obviously battling her inability to 
vocalize what had happened. My danger senses flaring with a decade 
worth of training I whirled around to on first glance spot nothing 
out of the ordinary as my eyes scanned for possible dangers. However, 
when I looked down onto the land below again I could SWEAR that I saw 
a tiny white sphere floating in the lower air, getting closer to the 
village. And I could feel it too. Very, VERY clearly. TOO clearly.
	&quot;Herb,&quot; Lhi Li behind me finally breathed out in a whispered 
hiss, swaying between fear and an - for her - uncommon anger. I 
needed a moment for the single word to make sense but Elder Kho Lon 
had told me about the surrounding area and its inhabitants as well as 
the natural enemies of the Amazons. And the Elder was out to look for 
just such a trail of them that had been discovered recently. The 
Council obviously was worried about an attack. Apparently the 
Matriarch had been outsmarted... but that meant...
	&quot;Kuso.&quot; A second later we were both in motion.

(Xian Pu)
Whistling I actually felt myself not minding the usual daily chores. 
After that morning I was now almost certain that Ranma was about 
to &quot;say the words&quot;. We had been getting so close and even more 
affectionate ever since the Ryoga incident that the redhead&#39;s 
feelings had been made more than just a little clearer. I could not 
suppress the smile at these thoughts and the happy tune springing 
from my lips. Quite frankly I had no intention to do so. By now I 
just couldn&#39;t grasp the concept of going to my old life without the 
presence of my Airen beside me.
	Not stopping at what I was doing - mainly fixing some of the 
damage the roof had acquired in one of the standard challenge 
matches - I acknowledged the presence pretending to subtly creep up 
behind me with one curt statement and a not-at-all-suppressed 
smirk. &quot;&lt;What Panda want?&gt;&quot; I must admit to be a tad bit surprised. 
That was about the first time my Airen&#39;s father had approached ME. 
Usually he tended to just vanish during the day - probably sulking 
somewhere about the unfairness and misery of his fate and in the 
process avoiding possible work. I swear Great-grandmother was on the 
verge of throwing him out but I think she just got more satisfaction 
of having Genma watch his son/daughter&#39;s defiance, stubbornly 
refusing to leave.
	&quot;So...&quot; The man stopped himself for a moment, obviously 
debating with himself if whatever he was up to was a good idea. 
Inwardly I tensed though I didn&#39;t envision much of a challenge. What 
came next nearly caused me to drop the hammer I was holding and that 
might have ended painful. &quot;&lt;Do you love my son?&gt;&quot; The question was 
straight-forward, for once not laced with the usual cowardice. It was 
apparent though that asking the question was obviously hard on the 
man.
	Slowly I turned around, finally recovering from the shock, 
and focused on the bald man with his usual bandana, trimmed glasses 
and gi. I was a little shocked at finding my gaze returned by a 
steady, unwavering one that seemed to bore directly through me. 
Refusing to admit intimidation I swallowed the lump that had been 
building in my throat. This wasn&#39;t Saotome Genma, coward father, 
trouble maker and all in all an insult to humanity. No, this was 
Saotome Genma, father of his son Ranma. Plain and simple.
	&quot;&lt;Why want to know?&gt;&quot; I asked, needing no reason to express 
my feelings for Ranma but curious about the sudden change in the 
man&#39;s demeanor. &quot;&lt;For all Xian Pu know, Xian Pu just obstacle for 
Panda father&#39;s own plans with Ranma. But Ranma not like that, Ranma 
own person, make own decisions. She know that now.&gt;&quot; I met the 
intense look with an equal sternness, refusing to lose the battle of 
wills.
	Finally Genma dropped his gaze to the ground in 
defeat. &quot;&lt;That was exactly what I feared... and hoped for.&gt;&quot; I think 
the double blink must have been heard at the other end of the 
village. &quot;&lt;It is true that it was always my dream to reunite the 
Anything Goes Schools and I am disappointed that this will most 
likely not come to pass anymore but...&gt; He looked up at me and I was 
glad that I was leaning against the wall already. Short of Ranma I 
had rarely seen such a conflict of emotions playing upon a human 
being&#39;s features. &quot;&lt;I realize that I have never been a very good 
father, socially at least. Due to my upbringing I just never could be 
that. All I could do was teach Ranma and hope he turned out better 
than I...&quot;&gt; A very thin smile briefly gleamed in the morning 
light. &quot;&lt;I am... a little proud of him.&gt;&quot;
	For several moments I really didn&#39;t know what to say. 
Unfortunately I never had the time to do so or answer his initial 
question - although I suppose that really was a mood point - as the 
ground shook viciously for a moment. My danger senses flared like a 
volcano had just erupted over the village and I was in motion a 
moment later. Surprisingly, or maybe not so, Ranma&#39;s father was right 
next to me, his features suddenly hardened and for the first time I 
really saw the mask of a seasoned warrior settle over his features.
	Not questioning the sudden odd behavior of the other male I 
made quick work of locating the powerful chi source. Directing our 
run over to the entrance area I felt a sudden feeling of dread 
overcome me as I tried to make out just why the chi pattern felt so 
disturbingly familiar.
	Arriving in the wide entrance area that still sported some 
traces from Ryoga&#39;s pre-emptive chi blast against Ranma I felt my 
blood run cold as I skidded to a sudden stop. I noted the other two 
unfamiliar arrivals but my gaze was fixated on the third one. It was 
hard to make out the gender of the human with the multi-colored hair 
that stood proudly between the two others, clad in a variety of 
impressive armor and the long cloak you had to get a closer look to 
know that you dealt with a woman. A woman with about much the same 
problem as my Airen&#39;s although acquired through different means.
	&quot;&lt;Who is that?&gt;&quot; I was startled out of my shocked state by 
the quiet and calculating voice next to me. Without looking at Genma 
who surely was just trying to not shiver while gauging the robed 
figure&#39;s chi levels I whispered, &quot;&lt;That&#39;s Herb.&gt;&quot; Having heard the 
stories as well as Ranma had I wasn&#39;t really surprised when I 
detected the sudden urge to turn tail and hide in the male&#39;s aura. 
The Amazon and Musk had been arch enemies for ages but actual war or 
similar clashes had never transpired for several centuries now. That 
was mostly because of the sharply decreasing number of offspring. The 
Musk were basically more powerful than the average Amazon but their 
number was low and we often had the advantage of tactical minds and a 
fair amount of magic to assist us in the past. A full-fledged war 
would not be beneficial for both sides and might result in both of 
our lineages to be eradicated. Therefore a silent peace treaty 
existed between the Amazons and the Musk Dynasty for longer than 
Great-grandmother lived.
	And that is why she was so troubled when numerous reports 
from Amazons outside the village had indicated that there &quot;was 
something going on&quot;. A bit of ominous hints there, a few Musk showing 
up in Amazon territory here and there. The quantity of the reports 
had worried the Council and finally after the Ryoga incident - when 
Ranma didn&#39;t need immediate attention anymore - the Matriarch had set 
out to investigate herself. This was a tactical mistake that might 
cost us dearly, I realized with a growing terror. Elder Kho Lon and 
Herb had had several encounters in the past and from all Amazons I 
doubted that anyone short of the Matriarch was able to stand up to 
the prince who&#39;s chi capacities were rumored to be nearly infinite.
	Genma who was dead set on getting away by now suddenly halted 
and I froze once again as the prince leveled a bone-chilling look 
directly in our... or better my direction. Totally ignoring the 
bodies of some of my fallen tribal sisters the man-turned-woman 
stepped forward and a cruel smile played upon her lips.
	&quot;Now, if that isn&#39;t the Old Nanny&#39;s little brat. My, you have 
grown... Get her!&quot; I was mildly surprised when Ranma&#39;s father 
suddenly stepped forward to intercept the two charging Musk but his 
efforts were rather wasted as he was unprepared for the formidable 
teamwork of animalistic-enhanced speed and strength. I suffered much 
the same fate, feeling rather inadequate against the duo even as the 
Tribal Champion. I was just too shocked to actually focus enough.
	I thrashed against the steel-like grip of the taller Musk to 
no avail. Disgustingly the pervert even seemed to pay an almost child-
like attention to my breasts before Herb ordered him into his place. 
I had probably preferred the fool&#39;s ministrations over being shoved 
into the prince&#39;s waiting arms. &quot;Now, now,&quot; the Musk Prince chuckled 
obviously quite amused by my squirming. &quot;Isn&#39;t that a nice catch?&quot; I 
tried to claw and bite at him in frustration but was rather 
unsuccessful at that.
	&quot;But, Herb-sama. Weren&#39;t we going to look for the Kaisuifuu?&quot; 
The smaller one of his companions said as the rest of the gathered 
Amazons watched on in fear of what was to happen. I could not really 
blame them. Herb chuckled. &quot;Sure. And the little brat here will just 
be the right way to find what we are looking for and... I&#39;m sure 
Granny will throw a fit if I take her with me. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll make a 
wonderful breeding mate for a prince like me.&quot; As the heir of the 
Musk Dynasty leaned closer to my ear, I felt a shiver run down my 
spine and a sudden fear grip my heart. An image of Ranma flashed 
briefly before my eyes. One of the redhead heartbroken and lonely, 
another one of her dying in a foolish attempt of battling Herb... I&#39;m 
sorry, Ranma... &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you like that,&quot; Herb whispered in my ear in 
a way that expressed quiet clear her actual distaste and how much it 
would enjoy him to see me suffering.
	&quot;KIJIN RAISHU DAN!&quot;
	Neither Herb, his henchmen or I ever really realized how 
quick everything had happened. One moment I was held captive by one 
of the most dangerous individuals walking Earth, the next two vacuum 
blades hissed with astonishing precision through the air. I 
registered a slight grunt from the cursed prince and felt his grip 
loosen. Just on cue someone had grabbed and carried me out of harm&#39;s 
way. For a moment I thought it was Ranma but the speed and graceful 
agility just didn&#39;t even match my Airen. I caught sight of familiar 
chestnut hair and smiled in relief.
	My attention was again diverted as my Airen&#39;s voice rose 
clearly from a background position as she stepped forward, the crowd 
of Amazon&#39;s parting and then backing up. Herb shouted something, a 
little enraged but not yet having lost her cool. Ranma glared at the 
Musk Prince and I gasped as I saw the aura around her that was 
practically afire in blazing reddish-gold. &quot;I am Saotome Ranma, Heir 
of the Saotome Mutsabeto Kakuto Ryu. You might want to know that the 
woman you just tried to abduct against her will is my wife and I 
intend on keeping it that way.&quot; My heart warmed at the redhead&#39;s 
words but I couldn&#39;t deny that I was a little scared for her. That 
was Herb after all we were speaking about. She had absolutely no idea 
what she was getting into.
	Herb for her part seemed to be mildly amused while the two 
other Musk moved to intercept my Airen and quirked an eyebrow. He was 
just about to make a comment but was getting no further than &quot;Wife, 
eh?&quot; or something like that as his amusement suddenly turned to 
shock. My Airen&#39;s aura literally exploded around her in an impressive 
demonstration of confidence chi that was making her eruption at Ryoga 
seem tiny in comparison.
	&quot;Yes, exactly, and I care for her a lot! I, Saotome Ranma, 
hereby challenge you! MOKO TAKABISHA!&quot;

(Kho Lon)
Yet another false trail that had nothing at all to do with the 
others. They were random, they were insignificant taken alone and 
they would usually only be viewed as a minor incident not worth 
investigating. If it just wasn&#39;t so damn much and obvious. I had 
never imagined that the Musk would make a move that soon. The proud 
dynasty had not only decreased in numbers but in pure-blooded 
descendants as well. The only ones with a long line of animal 
ancestry that was worth mentioning were Herb and his two henchmen as 
far as my knowledge went.
	Of course Herb alone was powerful enough to be a serious 
threat to the Joketsuzoku. The Prince of the Musk was from a long 
line of rulers that had pure dragon blood mixed into their genes 
which gave them an insane high supply of chi that safe for Saffron 
couldn&#39;t be rivaled by anyone on Earth to my knowledge so far. Yet he 
had made no move until now ever since ascending to the throne. That 
was mostly due to his own personal quest that held an almost ironic 
similarity to my Great-granddaughter&#39;s Airen. Therefore I doubted 
that the Musk would make a move before their leader hadn&#39;t cured 
himself. I wasn&#39;t even sure if his men knew. Probably not, seeing as 
prideful as the male was.
	And as to curing himself. Well, I knew where the Kaisuifuu 
was now and Herb knew that attacking my people would bring him 
nothing. A stray thought entered my mind and I looked back the way I 
came. Nah, he wouldn&#39;t do that. I shook my head but just to be 
careful reached out with my senses to check for a familiar pattern. I 
almost fell from my cane when I found exactly what I was looking and 
hoping for not to find.
	Letting lose a cascade of curses that would have been mind-
boggling for anyone of my fellow Amazons to hear from my mouth I 
stood there in the middle of the path, chastening myself for that 
incredible foolishness. &quot;Well,&quot; I said with a heavy sigh, &quot;at least 
Son-in-law should be training now. I swear the boy would just get 
himself into trouble and probably the whole village leveled in the 
process.&quot; A sudden flare of chi from a different source attracted my 
attention and I felt like slapping my forehead. &quot;On the other hand,&quot; 
I grumbled, swearing to myself if the boy survived that I would give 
him a piece of my mind. Granted he was extremely talented and in a 
few years could surpass any of us but he had little to no respect for 
his betters.
	&quot;I better get moving,&quot; I decided and set into motion. An 
uninvolved onlooker would deem it impossible to even attempt to get 
back in time. The way would take a normal human being at least two 
days back to the village and it had taken me three with careful 
tracking. Again an uninvolved onlooker would also deem it impossible 
for an old woman long past the age of a normal lifespan to suddenly 
blur into motion and speeding down the path she had just come from as 
nothing more as a gust of wind for the untrained eye.
	I just hoped I could get back in time and have enough 
reserves to prevent permanent damage. If Herb as much as wanted to he 
could level the village in a few minutes. Ranma might be able to hold 
his interest for several more but with all the high hopes I had into 
the boy that was the most I gave him.
	Of course, as things tended to go with Saotome Ranma 
involved, I probably was to be thoroughly surprised.

(Ranma)
A numbing fear I had never felt before had begun to set in as I raced 
side by side with Lhi Li - who had no problems keeping up - down the 
mountain path and towards the village. The history behind the Musk 
and the numerous warnings about their prince were ringing in my ears 
but the strong, overwhelming surge of concern at the fact that Xian 
Pu was down there, in immediate reach, unprotected was much more 
stronger. Elder Kho Lon had been gone for days and even when I 
admitted to her superior skill I did not think she was able to be 
back in time. None of the other Amazons came close to standing a 
chance against the Musk Prince, Xian Pu was their champion and I had 
seen the fear in her eyes when Kho Lon had taught me about the Musk 
during our studies. I knew it was foolish. Deep down I knew that 
logically I had no chance of beating Herb in terms of power. That 
didn&#39;t really seem to matter though.
	Coming close to the entrance my trained eyes spotted the 
blasted gate, several Amazons scattered around the ground in varying 
states of distress and the crowd that had gathered. I snatched a 
pretty good look at the figures in the circle of wary Amazons that 
obviously despite all their reputation were hesitant to attack and 
what I saw let my blood boil. Xian Pu was held by one of the strange 
men that bore obvious animal characteristics and fondled rather 
obviously.
	I saw red. I could feel a surge of chi travel through me as I 
watched the man shove my wife into his leader&#39;s arms. I considered my 
options through gritted teeth but when I heard Herb&#39;s words as we 
came in hearing range I just couldn&#39;t take it anymore. Glancing 
briefly back to Lhi Li, I saw she had already moved. Our eyes for a 
moment briefly met and a plan was made in a fashion only possible 
between two warriors.
	Bringing my hands forward and away in practically 
unrecognizable speed I was rewarded by the familiar hiss of vacuum 
forming as two chi blades shot through the air and struck the Prince 
in one shoulder while the other barely missed his head. That was 
enough though for the cursed man to let go of Xian Pu. In the blink 
of an eye Lhi Li had dove past him and carried Xian Pu off to the 
side.
	Anger by now had crested into a vivid flame but I didn&#39;t let 
it consume me. I wasn&#39;t Ryoga. Through the training of the last 
several days I had discovered that I couldn&#39;t bring about even a 
decent Shi Shi Houkodan anymore. Unlike Ryoga my surge of depression 
and anger had been a temporary thing, something so alien to my 
personality it had simply persisted to be let out at that one moment. 
I had tried a few times to recreate the situation but through the 
clarity that one-time use had brought felt that I was much too calm 
and... yes, actually happy right now to bring about that much dark 
chi again.
	Instead now I grasped onto another very familiar emotion that 
I hadn&#39;t felt since Jusenkyo and for once felt it responding in 
quantity and quality. I had meant what I told Lhi Li. My decision had 
been made. Maybe it had been made for a long time already but after 
the breakthrough at the fight with Ryoga I could finally see and 
admit to it. A life without Xian Pu at my side. A life without that 
caring, strong-willed Amazon that I had come to trust as I had never 
done with anyone before had become unthinkable. I... I DID love her. 
Now I just had to tell her and I would. I swear that I would.
	&quot;&lt;I am Saotome Ranma, Heir of the Saotome Mutsabeto Kakuto 
Ryu. You might want to know that the woman you just tried to abduct 
against her will is my wife and I intend on keeping it that way.&gt;&quot; 
Every word was spoken with the utmost truth and what in recent years 
often has been a shield for my own loneliness began returning tenfold 
and this time without any pretense, without any form of hiding behind 
it from the truth. I would have to fight Herb, I would win and I 
would survive to keep my promises. An incredible warmth began to 
encompass my heart and spread into my spirit. Drawing the dark chi 
necessary for the Shi Shi Houkodan had been cold and painful. 
Compared to that I almost felt a sense of serenity as the power built 
up higher and higher.
	Herb looked at me obviously not very impressed. The Amazons 
before me had stepped aside with a mixture of awe and fear. &quot;Wife, 
eh...?&quot; The cloaked prince never had a chance to finish whatever 
surely mocking comment he had in mind. By now my confidence had 
reached its peak and the only thought I allowed in my mind was that I 
had to win this fight... No, that I WOULD win this fight. Not only 
for me. Not only for Xian Pu. But for both of us.
	As I called out my challenge and brought my hands together to 
draw upon the raw chi around me, I noted with a little bit of 
satisfaction that I was actually looking forward to this. If the 
stories were right about Herb&#39;s skill this would be the best battle I 
ever had. And I intended to win. Which pretty much meant that my 
fighting spirit had fully returned.
	&quot;MOKO TAKABISHA!&quot; I roared, bringing my cupped hands and the 
gathered chi ball forward as a lance of reddish-golden chi spiraled 
through the air, throwing the other two Musk to the side. Herb&#39;s eyes 
that had momentarily went wide narrowed as the chi blast headed his 
way. But I wasn&#39;t overly-surprised nor did I stand to wait for him to 
deflect the blast with a chi shield. It was actually him who was 
surprised as I managed to blindside him, flowing into a wild, 
unpredictable pattern of attacks that flowed from Yamasenken to 
Umisenken to Amazon Style mixing with my own moves. With a certain 
smugness I watched as the prince had a hard time to keep up which 
kept him totally on the defense. And that was exactly how I wanted it.
	Dropping down I pretended to sweep his legs as he caught one 
of my legs after a spin kick. Anticipating that the cursed man 
wouldn&#39;t fall for the feint I brought my leg up just as the grip on 
my other started to loosen and smashed both into his belly. Okay, 
actually hers but I really didn&#39;t care about that right now.
	Herb stumbled back in surprise as I turned my momentum into 
another spin kick that he wasn&#39;t able to block this time. Landing on 
my feet I whirled around and once again called forth a Moko Takabisha 
that Herb was only able to weakly block. Trying to press my advantage 
I sped after his half-falling form but was caught by surprise as Herb 
shifted his course suddenly and shot forward right past me in a 
maneuver virtually impossible for a human being.
	Kuso, forgot he can fly or something like that. Caution 
overruled the urge to pursue as I flipped forward several times to 
avoid any possible attack. That proved to be a healthy thing because 
moments later to chi beams that had reflected from the ground in an 
impossible angle collided where I had stood a moment before. Turning 
the last flip into hundred-eighty degree turn, I came resting on my 
feet, taking a few deep breaths from the exchange. Herb had already 
come to rest several feet away and for all the pressing I had done he 
didn&#39;t even seem to be overly winded. This wasn&#39;t good. Not good at 
all.

(Xian Pu)
The crowd - including the other two Musk - looked on in a apt 
fascination as the two cursed man traded blows with a speed and power 
not usually encountered around here. Not even here in the village. 
This was a clash of two epic warriors. Both with their own special 
status. The problem was, I could clearly see that Ranma was terribly 
outclassed. She had pushed Herb back on the defense with the initial 
assault but now in their brief pause it became apparent that my Airen 
had been more winded from that than Herb was even remotely wounded.
	&quot;That was quite entertaining,&quot; Herb remarked, regarding the 
redhead with a bit more... respect. Well, as close as it could get to 
that with the arrogant prince. &quot;What was the name again? Saotome? I 
heard rumors that the little brat had gotten herself someone recently 
but I had never imagined a little girl like you.&quot; Ranma snarled at 
the accusation and I felt a pang of anger rise inside of me as well 
but suppressed it for the moment.
	&quot;You are one to talk, Herb-chan...&quot; I couldn&#39;t help the 
snicker and obviously several others around them couldn&#39;t either. The 
crowd quickly went silent again as Herb expressed her opinion of 
that. &quot;Shut up you! At least once I found a cure the brat is going to 
learn what a real man is capable of.&quot; I really wanted to smash him at 
this point and Lhi Li had to restrain me from following threw with 
that urge.
	Ranma, opposite to what would have happened before Ryoga 
where she would probably have reacted badly at being reminded of her 
cursed state, merely shrugged. &quot;I bet I beat you to it.&quot; At that Herb 
looked thoroughly confused. My Airen just snorted and began to subtly 
shift her stance. &quot;Really, for all your supposed greatness you 
haven&#39;t figured it out by now? You are not the only one with that 
problem of yours present.&quot; It took awhile for realization to set in. 
Several murmurs arose around us as the secret was revealed but I 
could tell it wasn&#39;t really bothering Ranma. The redhead had simply 
waited for the surprise to set in and momentarily distract Herb. In a 
flash she had closed the distance again and was laying into the Musk 
Prince(ss) again.
	However, as impressive as my Airen was all her attacks seemed 
to do minimal to no damage to the leader of the Musk and seemed to 
only amuse him. Ranma was quickly tiring and that showed when Herb 
suddenly came around with a hard fist to her chin lifting the redhead 
partly from the ground and then switching from defense to a 
devastating offense in a flash. Ranma barely had time to adjust to 
the sudden whirlwind of attacks and more than one slipped past her 
defense. In no more than barely one or two minutes she was already 
breathing hard, sporting a nasty cut over the right eye, her shirt 
was slightly torn and you could tell that she had received a hit to 
the ribs as well that was bothering her. Herb connected another with 
his heavy boots across my Airen&#39;s face and I had to watch with 
dawning horror as she crashed into the wall of a nearby house.
	&quot;Airen!&quot; I moved in a desperate attempt to do SOMETHING but 
was held back by a strong grip on my shoulder. I turned a glare at 
Lhi Li who just shook her head and indicated in the direction where 
Ranma had went down with her chin. The sight of the petite redhead 
actually spitting some blood was heart-wrenching but she was already 
struggling to get up again. &quot;Leave him be. It&#39;s his fight, his 
challenge. You do trust him, do you?&quot; I nodded numbly, torn between 
reason and emotion. &quot;Then do so. Ranma... cares for you, he&#39;ll come 
out of this alright.&quot; I nodded again but my eyes were glued on the 
figure of my Airen weakly but stubbornly getting to her feet. So much 
like me, I mused. Lhi Li was right. I had to believe in her. Besides, 
it WAS her challenge. If someone interfered now it would be worse 
than death. Ranma was as much prideful as any Amazon would be and I 
understood that very well. As much as it hurt to see her like that I 
had to respect her - definitely foolish - decision to challenge Herb.
	Come on, Ranma. Teach that arrogant jerk a lesson, I prayed.

(Ranma)
Kuso, that hurt. My face burned like hell from that last kick and I 
had the suspicion that something broke. One of my ribs obviously had 
taken severe damage and it was getting harder to breathe. My vision 
was clouding and it was hard to see through the haze of numbing pain. 
And that one punch to my gut had nearly paralyzed me. I tasted blood 
on my lips and spat it out. No internal damage... yet. But if that 
kept up it was only a matter of time.
	Come on, Saotome, you won&#39;t let yourself get thrashed by this 
freak, will you? I struggled to my feet, shaking my head in a vain 
attempt to clear it. My danger senses flared and it was the only 
thing that saved me as I instantly threw myself to the right, 
ignoring the protest of my body. Something flashed past me that 
looked remarkably like knifes, little chi blades maybe. One brushed 
against my left shoulder and I let out a painful scream as the hot 
energy penetrated flesh upon contact. Coming down in a roll and 
barely managing to stay in the kneeling position I looked back to 
where I had stood moments before. The little chi blades had left 
HOLES in the wall as they just cut right through it. Oh shit.
	I had to do something. And I had to do it fast. Herb was 
quicker, stronger and had much more reserves than I did. There was no 
way I could beat him in a regular way. Not to mention that my body 
was on the verge of collapse. My mind worked overtime, straining 
against the fogginess that came with the renewed pain. I had an idea 
already what I could do. However, I wasn&#39;t sure if I was ready. Up to 
now I had succeeded with this once, on a much lower level and the 
protesting signals my body was sending me wouldn&#39;t help the matter 
either.
	Oh well. It is not as if I have a choice. There really wasn&#39;t 
anything I could do at this point to beat the prince hand-to-hand. 
Alright, time to set this plan into motion. &quot;&lt;That all you can do,&gt;&quot; 
I pressed through clenched teeth as I pushed myself up to meet my 
opponent with what hopefully was a confident gaze. &quot;&lt;Really, I 
expected a little more from the... Princess of the Musk.&gt;&quot; There was 
a noticeable twitch in the other cursed man&#39;s face but I had to 
admire his remarkable control because he refused to give into blind 
rage, knowing full well that rage only made a warrior more vulnerable.
	&quot;&lt;I admire your endurance, Saotome, but you can barely stand. 
Whatever could push you onward further. Admit defeat and I might 
spare you.&gt;&quot; I fought against the pain as I took a stance once again 
that was purely for defense, I wouldn&#39;t need anything else. &quot;&lt;Come 
on, you are a smart man. Surely it must disgust you to live with a 
society that is dominated by women. You are a talented warrior, why 
don&#39;t you come with me, I am sure together we can acquire a cure for 
you as well.&gt;&quot;
	My aura flickered briefly as I fought down the anger and 
solely continued the build-up of the Soul of Ice as I gritted my 
teeth. &quot;&lt;I have something that is worth living for here.&gt;&quot; My eyes 
briefly flickered over to Xian Pu who watched the whole exchange with 
worried eyes and surely only one step from jumping in-between us in a 
foolish attempt to stop the fight. My eyes softened momentarily as I 
sent her a reassuring smile and I felt my resolve harden as it was 
answered by one of trust.
	Herb had followed my gaze and now let out a disgusted 
snort. &quot;&lt;Her? Oh really what could the manipulative brat possible 
give you?&quot;&gt; Tightening on my control I relied on something that came 
as second nature to me from ten years of training. Raising an eyebrow 
I replied in a mocking voice, &quot;&lt;What? Are you by any chance jealous, 
Herb-chan. Could it be that no girl wants to be with another girl 
that really is a man? Are you envious, Herb-chan, that I have her and 
will have a cure while you will have to continue to rule your people 
as a...&gt;&quot; I paused searching for the words, &quot;&lt;...oh so adorable and 
CUTE little Princess?&gt;&quot;
	All the while I had watched as the man-turned-woman began to 
slowly lose control of his calm as I continued to mock his cursed 
state. I really had an advantage here now because I understood 
perfectly well what he was feeling, what his state meant to him. 
Unlike Herb though I felt no unease anymore to speak about it. I had, 
so to say, come to terms with my curse. I really had to thank Ryoga 
again the next time he happened to stumble over me.
	Suddenly I let my voice become deeper and dead serious. &quot;&lt;I 
have no intention of leaving, Herb. And if you must know. Xian Pu is 
reason enough for me to stay. She gave me shelter and compassion when 
all I wanted to do was die out of shame. She stayed with me and 
offered me comfort when all I wanted to do was sink into misery. She 
was the friend I did not have for all my life and she offered me her 
unconditional love without wanting anything in return. She has 
provided me with a home and a life that I could actually enjoy, a 
possible family and friends. For the first time in my life I feel 
accepted by at least a few people, I feel understood. I don&#39;t expect 
you know how that is... Hime-chan. And that is why I can&#39;t... That is 
why I WILL NOT lose! Come and try to get me but if you want to get to 
Xian Pu or any of her sister you first have to go through me, loser!&gt;&quot;
	I could hear the murmurs all around me as a silent 
determination began to settle in and fuel me. I knew now I could pull 
this off, I knew I would win. Whispers of approval reached my ears 
and some of the Amazons even cheered and slowly, reluctantly it 
became apparent that one battle had already been won today. The 
battle of acceptance for Xian Pu and me. What had begun as a rising 
respect after the Mu Tsu and Ryoga incident had reached its peak. Now 
I just had to win this fight, especially with the new support. There 
was NO WAY I could lose now. Absolutely no way.
	&quot;&lt;Very well, Saotome. Now you made this personal. I shall 
show you what I am really capable of and afterwards I will take a 
great delight in teaching your beloved Amazon a few lessons.&gt;&quot; Herb 
tried to hold his voice steady but you could hear the seething tone 
in his voice from a long distance. And I had even not yet finished 
with him. Taunting was something I had done for nearly a decade in 
every fight with Oyaji. If I wanted someone angry, I could get 
someone angry.
	I made a beckoning gesture while faking a yawn, not at all 
impressed by his threats. &quot;&lt;Over my dead body, Hime-chan.&gt;&quot; And Herb 
charged. Having already so deeply settled into the Soul of Ice I 
could concentrate everything into fueling my motions with my 
remaining chi, tuning my body to really inhuman levels to avoid 
Herb&#39;s anger-fueled attacks. As I weaved around the enraged Musk 
Prince, despite all my efforts his attacks coming dangerously close 
to connecting, I began to slowly lead him into the spiral all the 
while Elder Kho Lon&#39;s words present in my mind. Herb has managed to 
find ways to counter the Hiryu Shoten Ha which is why it is 
practically ineffective against him. I had asked the Elder why not to 
use the Dragon against him if he was so much stronger. After all that 
was what the technique was originally designed for. Of course it made 
sense - and even more so now - that such a capable fighter would 
devise a defense against this. Exactly how he managed to turn the 
Hiryu Shoten Ha against the caster was not exactly known. But that 
didn&#39;t matter really.
	If you hadn&#39;t looked closely one wouldn&#39;t have seen the tiny 
gleam of triumph in the crimson red eyes that spoke clearly of his 
dragon bloodline. I saw it though. Herb had allowed the rage to come 
and intensify with every word, every taunt I threw his way but in the 
back of his mind he was already preparing a counter... Which was 
exactly what I wanted.
	I had a promise to fulfill. I had to tell Xian Pu of my 
decision and I had to be alive. Just a little more. I just had to 
ignore the strain a little more. Pushing the pain a little further 
back I tightened my cold chi around the almost unbearable aches as we 
neared the center of the spiral. Now came the tricky part. I could 
not hesitate one moment, I could not make one mistake. This fight 
would be over after this, one way or another.
	As I stepped into the center of the spiral, noticing that the 
crowd had backed up a large distance, I could see a smile of smug 
anticipation form on Herb&#39;s face. That smile though quickly gave way 
to confusion as my momentum - obviously by accident - carried me past 
the center point. Waiting for the just the right moment until a 
baffled Herb passed over the center and froze for just that tiny, 
crucial moment - any counter absent from his mind, I allowed myself a 
truly terrifying grin that left no room to argue that doom was about 
to come for my opponent.
	&quot;HIRYU SHOTEN HA, REVISED!&quot;
	I thrust my fist into the sky and immediately a tornado this 
part of China surely had not seen before sprang into existence. Herb 
stared in stunned wonder as the trashing winds picked me up and I had 
to fight with every ounce of control left inside to keep my voluntary 
flight steady. Fortunately I had picked just the right point and 
moment to enter the spiral again. Ever so slowly I edged myself 
forward in the violent winds that were much more powerful than Ryoga 
ought to have experienced.
	&quot;HIRYU...&quot;
	Opening my spiritual shields I winced and bit my lip as I was 
assaulted by a magnitude of chi that was threatening to tear me apart 
just from touching it. My body was afire with searing pain as I began 
taping into the mixture of hot and cold chi all around me just as I 
had done this morning. I ignored the flashing red emergency signals 
my body was sending me as the pure energy washed over opened wounds 
as best as I could.
	&quot;KOURIN...&quot;
	Chi in quantity and quality began to flow through me that it 
was actually unhealthy for a human being. My body was ready to burst 
but I kept taping into the link, refusing to give in, refusing to 
admit defeat. Saotome Ranma never loses. Almost there now. The winds 
had carried me like a whirlpool towards the center of the spiral. It 
still wasn&#39;t enough chi though. Just a little more.
	Another bolt of pain raced through me as I tried to pull even 
more of the untamed energy inside of me. Xian Pu. A picture of the 
smiling Amazon flashed briefly through my mind and I desperately held 
onto it. A spark of... something suddenly stirred inside of me and 
pushed away the numbing aches of my physical self. And then the link 
with the outside chi totally snapped into place and all I felt was an 
overwhelming calm as the purest kind of life energy rushed through 
me, filled every cell of my being. It felt like I died and had been 
reborn in the same fraction of a moment. So calm and peaceful...
	Herb below stared up at me as I let the chi sphere between my 
hands built and the slack-jawed and horrified expression on his face 
as I began my descent was worth all the pain. Really.
	&quot;DAN!&quot;

(Xian Pu)
I could feel my heart hammering during Ranma&#39;s honest confession and 
I felt more than one pair of eyes directed towards me. Not in envy or 
extreme jealousy but in a new if reluctant sense of approval and 
pride, a little remorse maybe as several of my sister&#39;s hearts were 
touched by my Airen&#39;s words. Then some began to cheer I felt like I 
was bursting from joy. In one - totally foolish and selfless - act of 
bravery Ranma had managed what no man - cursed or not - had done 
before. They were looking up to him. To this quiet yet energetic, 
confident yet calculating strength. This was not just admiration, 
this was a pride that only true warriors could feel. A pride of 
having someone like the redhead in their rows willing to fight for 
them. And all of them must have realized that she was mine. In this 
statement was so much more than the absence of envy. There was an 
acknowledgment of the deepest kind.
	Herb, as far as the Amazons went, was a feared legend. 
Someone you just not stand up to and risk your life against, maybe 
not even for a loved one. I had seen the terror in the eyes of these 
normally fearless warriors when I arrived here. And then there was 
Ranma. Bravely stepping up to the cursed prince in a struggle he 
could not possibly win. She did it for herself but also because of a 
debt she felt owing us... owing ME. This was the kind of dedication 
that made the difference between a good warrior and an excellent one.
	My awareness snapped back to the fight as I saw Herb about 
ready to bring hell upon my Airen who in turn stood her ground with a 
deep calm and a freezing blue aura. Puzzlement set in at this but I 
had the presence of mind to take the proper steps of 
caution. &quot;Everyone back!&quot; It was not really necessary since most of 
the onlookers had already realized what was going on. This time the 
village will take damage, I thought with a slight frown. However, I 
was thoroughly confused at my Airen&#39;s tactics. We had both been there 
when Great-granddaughter told us about Herb. The prince knew the 
Dragon. Why would she use it...
	&quot;Is he sure he knows what he&#39;s doing?&quot; I looked down startled 
at the familiar old voice. Unnoticed Great-grandmother had appeared 
next to us and was following Ranma&#39;s attempts to draw Herb into a 
spiral with narrowed eyes. &quot;That fool. All he will succeed in is 
destroying the village and himself.&quot; As Elder Kho Lon moved forward I 
was a little bit surprised at myself when I held up a hand in front 
of her. The older woman turned a surprised but sharp gaze at me but 
for once in my young life I wasn&#39;t going to budge. Ranma had not 
against Herb so I would not here. Lhi Li was right, this was Ranma&#39;s 
fight. Interference was not permitted. I shook my head slowly and 
sadly, fixing Great-grandmother with a stare of defiance that in any 
other situation would have earned me a severe punishment. This time 
though the Matriarch&#39;s eyes softened and after briefly closing them 
she turned back to the fight without another word.
	&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Lhi Li suddenly said. &quot;I think I know what 
he&#39;s up to.&quot; Three sets of eyes - Ranma&#39;s father was still present - 
glanced at her. Out in the battlefield Ranma and Herb had almost 
neared the center of the spiral. The other Amazon simply smiled. &quot;Oh, 
just look. You&#39;ll see.&quot; After awhile she added in a whisper that I 
barely even caught, &quot;Hopefully he can pull it off.&quot;
	I had no time to think about this further as Ranma to the 
surprise of anyone passed the center of the spiral and called out the 
Hiryu Shoten Ha a bit too late. A gasp of horror threatened to escape 
my lips but I felt Lhi Li squeeze my hand gently as she looked up. 
With a numbing dread I followed her gaze and what I saw caused me to 
inhale sharply. Ranma... was RIDING the storm. The pattern seemed 
uncontrollable at first glance, the usual helplessness of someone 
caught in the chi storm. However, if you watched clearly you could 
see that the redhead had caught the currents in a way that would 
slowly carry her directly to the center where Herb was trapped... 
trapped...
	&quot;HIRYU...&quot;
	Oh... OH.
	&quot;KOURIN...&quot;
	&quot;Masaka...&quot; I mumbled, involuntary mimicking Great-
grandmother at the first day of Ranma&#39;s training. I could see the 
strain on Ranma&#39;s face as the surely extraordinary pain from the many 
wounds was assaulted by the chi. I squinted my eyes and confirmed 
that there really was a sphere forming between my Airen&#39;s hands. And 
then realization fully set in what exactly was going on.
	Ranma had reached the central opening of the tornado now. The 
Eye of the Storm. Her face was scrunched up in deep concentration and 
deep lines showed that she was ready to explode from the exhaustion 
and the pain assaulting her senses. Just a little more, I urged, 
trying to practically WILL Ranma&#39;s success in harnessing the energies 
around her into existence. There was an unexpected... jolt as 
something brushed against my aura. Even from so far away and even 
that I never really felt it in this way before, I just KNEW that it 
was Ranma reaching out for support. Reacting on instinct, not really 
aware of what I was doing, I responded by mentally grasping for her 
spirit and sending calming and soothing energy along.
	Up on the whirlwind Ranma seemed to suddenly relax and that 
smile she sent down Herb&#39;s way. I couldn&#39;t see the Prince concealed 
by the raging winds but I was sure that at least now he would be the 
one to feel fear.
	&quot;DAN!&quot;
	And with a murdering scream that let anyone&#39;s heart stop for 
a moment Ranma let the chi ball go as a thick beam of pure whiteness 
barreled down the center towards the ground and the trapped Herb. 
Everyone stared in fascination as the beam didn&#39;t seem to just leave 
the redhead&#39;s hands but stayed there like a steady stream of... 
sunlight focused through a mirror for lack of a better description. 
With a last roar of defiance the chi storm began to crumble inwardly 
following Ranma down on her way through the center as a wave of pure 
energy channeled through the insane girl&#39;s hand that sought to defy 
nature.
	The sound of collision that followed could be described as 
nothing short of a sonic boom. The ground shook violently and there 
was such a backlash that everyone was blown from their feet. A few 
minor explosion rocked the area a few times as aftershocks but then 
everything was silent.

(Ranma)
I felt like the very world was collapsing around me as I came down as 
the center of the tornado. The whole thing must have taken mere 
moments, a few seconds at best, but it felt like a small eternity. 
The roar of the elements around me, trashing violently, bucking 
against and finally admitting defeat to the treatment. The chi 
rushing through me in sheer endless quality, a steady stream that 
would not stop until it found an outlet. And that outlet was Herb, I 
was just the conductor.
	And the Prince knew it. Oh, how he knew it. His position 
didn&#39;t allow him evasion. He was trapped, caught like the animal in 
the hunter&#39;s cage. The chi channeling by now had the nice side effect 
that the storm had really turned into pure chi as it rushed out 
through my hands. It was like either facing the bullet from the front 
or risking death tearing through electrical-charged bars. Not really 
a choice there. The shield that the cursed prince had thrown up in a 
desperate attempt to delay the inevitable was quickly crumbling to 
dust under the constant assault and by the time I was almost upon him 
was already crushed.
	Still I could see the stubbornness in his eyes as he stood 
tall in a defying manner, not willing to accept defeat. Oh well. 
Everyone his own. It was time to finish this. &quot;&lt;I told you,&gt; I called 
over the rumbling sound of the chi dome collapsing behind 
me. &quot;&lt;Saotome Ranma doesn&#39;t lose.&gt;&quot; I had my fist drawn back and in a 
last act of truly amazing - even to me, mind you - willpower gathered 
as much chi in it as I could hold. When I let it fly Herb&#39;s block 
never really had the sliver of a chance. Oh, he met the punch and for 
a timeless moment we even held the pose but as the remaining chi 
washed over us I pressed onwards, totally unaffected by the cresting 
wave of power. Herb&#39;s cry of pain as the punch caught him despite all 
his defenses right in the stomach was lost in the crescendo of 
explosions and aftershocks.
	Then the smoke cleared we stood there for a moment as if 
totally unaffected by the onslaught, my fist still buried in my 
opponent&#39;s abandon. Herb lifted his torn and severely burned face to 
meet my gaze for a moment. &quot;&lt;Seems... that you won.&gt;&quot; And then his 
last bit of chi defenses winked out and he was pushed backwards. 
Another small explosion rocked the area as the chi of my strike 
exploded. Herb crashed to the ground unmoving but surely not dead. As 
much as I despised him as a human I acknowledged him as a warrior. I 
had been prepared to do what was necessary but with that enormous 
amounts of chi to his disposal I would have been surprised if he 
hadn&#39;t survived.
	One way or another, it was done. I had won. A warm feeling of 
relief and joy rushed through me but I didn&#39;t allow myself to clearly 
think again yet. Holding onto the last ounce of control with a steel-
like mental grip I caught the eyes of the other two Musk in my gaze 
who had hung back just like the other Amazons. There was anger there 
and the readiness to avenge their leader on the spot but there was 
also fear. A deep, respectful fear at the boy-turned-girl who had 
brought down their mighty prince.
	I nudged my head in the direction of the fallen Musk leader 
with one clear gesture and let my eyes flash for emphasis with the 
last spark of chi present in my otherwise drained body. Only 
willpower that I could not quite believe was even my own anymore let 
me still stand. Thankfully there was only a small hesitation as the 
two Musk warriors moved forward cautiously to retrieve the fallen 
form of their prince, grumbling curses all the way and out the 
village. None really made a move to stop them.
	NOW it is really done. Just one more thing to do, I thought 
as I finally let my control slip and collapse to the ground.

(Xian Pu)
The crowd parted silently as the two Musk carried a defeated and 
thoroughly beaten Herb out of the village. There was no real need to 
hinder them. It was not in our nature to take prisoners and trying to 
keep the Musk Prince restrained was only calling for trouble. Also 
judging by his physical state it would take him awhile to heal his 
body, much more his spirit from such a devastating defeat. No, Herb 
wouldn&#39;t cause trouble anytime soon.
	Those thoughts were only on the edge of my awareness though. 
My gaze was fixed on the form of my Airen, standing there absolutely 
still until the trio was out of sight. I had already moved, 
anticipating that only her stubbornness held her on both feet. 
However, that gaze she had nailed the two Musk with. I think even I 
would have run. Now though the danger was gone and reality slowly 
began to set it...
	More like rushed in. As if someone had snapped their fingers 
to break the spell that held my Airen upright, Ranma practically 
dropped like a stone just as I reached her. Gently lowering her form 
to the ground I smiled down at her with shameless tears, trying to 
express all my worries, pride and love at the same time. The redhead 
looked almost deathly pale and tired beyond description. How she 
could manage even the simple task of holding her eyes open or 
reaching up with her hand to touch my cheek I did not know. But it 
did not matter. It did not matter at all.
	The soft and loving gaze melted my heart right there. Eyes as 
clear as the sky settled onto mine and I felt my throat tighten as 
they shifted to a unyielding seriousness burning right into my soul. 
There was a long silence as we just continued to stare at each other 
in that manner that was truly amazing and not to describe with such 
simple means as words. I could feel the eyes of the onlookers locked 
on us, a respectful distance away, but paid them no mind. There was 
nothing that mattered right now other than the deep penetrating stare 
that held an unspoken truth and confession.
	When the words finally came it was barely a whisper but yet 
echoed as loudly in my mind and heart alike as the declaration of a 
god. &quot;Wo ai ni... Airen.&quot; I was forced to choke back the lump in my 
throat as my heart threatened to jump right there and I could not 
move under this serious yet soft and loving gaze. She meant it. She 
said it. She... LOVES... ME! was about the only thing that rang in my 
mind and heart like an infinite echo.
	A silent tear slid down my face but I didn&#39;t move to wipe it 
away. The feeling of belonging settling deep into my innermost self 
was simply to wonderful to be disturbed by dumb concepts like pride 
and reputation. I didn&#39;t really believe that anybody present would 
deny my right of emotion right now. &quot;I love you too,&quot; I choked out my 
voice thick with emotion as I reached out to brush through red hair 
and clutch the hand on my cheek. For a moment I felt my mild 
annoyance as I noticed that Ranma had already slipped into 
unconsciousness but a fond smile quickly overrode that. &quot;Baka, you 
absolutely had to make this dramatic, did you?&quot; I commented sniffling 
a little.
	At last wiping my face clear with one hand as best as I could 
I picked up the limb form of my - now really established - Airen, 
making sure that her breathing was regular. As I turned around I 
stopped briefly to glance at Lhi Li with a thankful nod which the 
girl returned with a kind smile. &quot;Xian Pu,&quot; Great-grandmother spoke 
up and I could see that through the calm mask of the Matriarch there 
was a deep fondness and pride towards me and Ranma. I regarded her 
with a slightly impatient look. After all I wanted Ranma in bed and 
comfortably resting  &quot;When he comes to, tell Son-in-law as soon as he 
is rested you set out to acquire his cure.&quot;
	As I turned and walked away, followed by a rising cheer from 
my Amazon sisters I could only marvel at the impression the so 
innocent looking redhead had left on everyone. The shouts around us 
varied but there was a common theme. After today, Ranma had been 
accepted as their personal champion - which she technically was after 
defeating and bonding with me anyway. The fact that she was actually 
male didn&#39;t matter to them and as far as I knew that had never 
happened in Amazon history before.
	If you listened really carefully I was sure you could HEAR 
the proud smile splitting my face as I carried my Airen away to a 
more than well-earned rest.

Author&#39;s Notes

Err, woah... We are finished? You sure, Maia? Don&#39;t want to add 
anything else? No? Really?

*SIGH*

Man, this part just didn&#39;t want to be finished. I swear it 
steadfastly refused to be finished. Really how did I deserve this? No 
really, it&#39;s not that I&#39;m complaining but somewhere along the way I 
wondered if I would drop dead before finishing this part. There was 
just always a bit more to write, a bit more to express, a bit more to 
add... Alright I should have known better than to assume that three 
battle scenes plus focusing on a building relationship would be easy 
and quick to do but still...

Oh to hell with it. I want to finish this. Back to the notes for the 
story.

For all who are reading with no knowledge of the actual Anime/Manga 
(I know that&#39;s possible with AU since I did it myself). The Bakusei 
Tenketsu training requires the trainee to be bound with only one hand 
and forefinger outstretched. Bound as he/she is the trainee will be 
hurled full-force and speed at a massive boulder (or was it the other 
way round?) until he/she picks up on the technique and manages to 
shatter it properly. After Ryoga was put through the training even 
the Amaguriken was barely able to hurt him since his body was quite 
steeled from the training.

Lhi Li is my own character. She is one of this (annoying) original 
characters that are only meant for one scene and then somehow get 
stuck because you like them too much. I hope you like her too. She 
will probably only be in this part but nevertheless, you never know 
when and where she might show up later.

I have found several different sources that say how the Moko 
Takabisha and Shi Shi Houkodan are colored. I have never seen them 
myself. So I tried to make it a bit of a cross between the varying 
color descriptions I got.

My version on the Hiryu Kourin Dan probably is a bit different from 
the original. To be honest I&#39;m not even sure of the name for the 
counter version but that is what I found quite often. Anyway, just 
keep in mind that it is AU and Ranma might develop things a little 
different.

I know that I probably won&#39;t please anyone with my Anti-Musk view in 
this part (and quite frankly for the rest of the series). First, 
always keep in mind that this is AU and not everything up to this 
point HAS TO happen as it did (and really it won&#39;t). Second, Herb 
(not counting Mint and Lime who didn&#39;t take that great of a role in 
this part) is the only character in the story that I only knew 
through online sources and fanfics, so please be a little gentle with 
me if I did some mistakes here and there in description of appearance 
etc. but he/she was totally necessary to appear. Third from what I 
gathered from my resources even in canon history, true intentions and 
actually resources of the Musk Dynasty was rather vague. What we 
learned is that the Musk and the Amazons obviously don&#39;t like it each 
other. I just took that a step up. The free will of the author, you 
can call it. :) If you are a true Ranma otaku and really want to 
correct fatal errors please feel free to do mail me and explain it to 
me in a reasonable manner.

That&#39;s all that really needs to be explained... I hope. One can never 
know with such a long part but all of you know how to reach me. Now I 
hope I didn&#39;t leave too many mistakes behind and that all in all this 
part is worth the long time it took writing. In my personal opinion 
I&#39;m not totally satisfied with some of the earlier scenes but maybe 
that is just me, and on the other hand there are scenes that I am 
quite proud of. Make up your own mind and be sure to tell me. I am 
REALLY anxious to see how this part turned out in the mind of the 
reader. So leave your feedback either in my inbox or wherever you 
find this.

Ja ne, yours
