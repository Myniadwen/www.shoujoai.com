--------------------------------------------------------------------
To understand this lemon, watching or reading some of Ranma 1/2
may be helpful. But it&#39;s not essential, truth be known I&#39;ve never
seen it myself, so I apologise in advance for any inaccurate
characters or story elements.

I would like to thank Ryan L. Spradling for the concept behind this
lemon and for advising me on Ranma 1/2. He asked for this lemon, and
made it possible.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

A thick mist shrouded a Shinto temple. Ukyo walks along a path
through various misty stone temple arches to the
main temple building, alone, in a traditional Japanese wedding dress.
&quot;(I can&#39;t believe it! My wedding day!)&quot; She thought, trying to stop
herself giggling out-loud in excitement. She just smiled,
as she proudly held a bouquet of flowers in her hands.

She could barely see three metres in front of her, it was so misty,
but she found her way, to the open front entrance of the main temple
building. Inside was dimly lit with torches. She walked up a
central isle to see that everyone she had ever known where there
to see her big day. They watched her as she reached the centre of
the temple. Ranma was there in a traditional wedding suit,
he stood beside the temple priest, who was holding the wedding tea.

Ukyo couldn&#39;t be happier; the day she had always wanted had arrived.
But something was wrong. She wasn&#39;t alone. She turned her head to the
right, to see two other girls were with her. It was Akane and Shampoo,
both in the same wedding dress as Ukyo, holding the same bouquet as
her. They had lined up into a row with Ukyo, in front of the
temple priest and Ranma. It looked like they were getting married
too. But to who? There was only one groom here, Ranma.

&quot;Shampoo? Akane? W...what are you doing here?&quot; They just looked at
her and smiled. &quot;Ranchan? What&#39;s going on?&quot; She said in an upset,
almost panicking voice. She was afraid that the other girls had come
to steal Ranma away from her, when she was so close to marring him.
Ranma didn&#39;t say anything either, he just looked at her and smiled.
She looked at the priest, he just smiled too. &quot;What&#39;s going on?!!!&quot;

The sound of a large temple gong being struck, echoed throughout
the building. Ukyo looked up to see where the sound was coming from.
But there was no gong, anywhere. She looked back down again, only
to find that the priest had been replaced by a beautiful, naked,
brunette haired woman, who was holding the wedding tea just as
the priest had. Ukyo blushed a little at the site of this woman,
but was still surprised about her sudden appearance, and lack of
clothes. &quot;Wh...what the?&quot;

The gong sounded again. She looked at Ranma with surprise.
Ranma had changed to his female form, and was also naked.
Ukyo began to breath heavily when she saw Ranma&#39;s naked female
body. Weird feelings coursed through her own body. She loved
Ranma, but, she felt an attraction to his female form.
She started to become frightened, she didn&#39;t want to think
this way, she didn&#39;t want to be here anymore.

The gong sounded again. She looked beside her. Akane and
Shampoo were naked, and were looking at her with loving eyes.
She stared at them for a few seconds, especially at Akane,
she couldn&#39;t tell why she looked at her so much.
She just blushed some more before she decided to get out, now.
She walked as fast as she could. The dress made it hard to
move very quickly, she had only walked a few yards away,
when the gong sounded again.

All the wedding guests, had changed to naked women, all looking
at Ukyo. Ukyo stopped in her tracks at the sight of this.
Seconds later the gong sounded again. The guests all smiled at Ukyo,
and looked up and down her body. She was confused by their
actions, that was of coarse until, a light breeze came in through
the entrance. Then she realised, now she was naked too.

She still had her bouquet, and used it cover her groin, as she
used her free arm to cover her chest. She blushed bright red and
was fixed to the spot with embarrassment. &quot;(Oh, this can&#39;t be
happening!!)&quot; As she whispered this to herself, she heard bare
footprints behind her. She turned around to see Akane and
Shampoo, they both still had their bouquets.

Ukyo looked over at Shampoo who was looking at her as if.....
as if she loved her. Her attention quickly moved to Akane
who was moving towards her. She was in arms length of Ukyo when
she stopped, and looked at her the same way Shampoo did.
&quot;Akane....honey, what&#39;s going on? What kind of wedding is this?&quot;
&quot;Yours....&quot; Spoke Akane softly for the first and only time.

The gong sounded one last time. Akane threw her bouquet towards
the guests, all the time looking Ukyo in the eyes, lovingly.
She rips Ukyo&#39;s bouquet from her hands and does the same to it
much to Ukyo&#39;s horror. &quot;Akane?! I need that!!&quot;
Akane walks right up to Ukyo, and begins to wrap her arms
around her. Ukyo couldn&#39;t move,
she was fixed to the spot somehow.

Akane lowers Ukyo and lies her on the cold stone floor,
then lies over her. The guests begin to applaud Ukyo
as Akane slowly moved her head towards her&#39;s.
Ukyo was paralysed, she couldn&#39;t move, even if she wanted to,
and some small part of her seemed to want this. It wanted
her to be with Akane, to kiss her, to love her.

The applause got louder; the guests began to cheer and scream
with joy......as Akane closed her eyes and pressed her lips
up against Ukyo&#39;s.

------------------------

&quot;AKANE!&quot; Ukyo woke suddenly, sweating. She was a little
confused. She felt her lips, they were tingling with the
sensation of Akane&#39;s touch. But it wasn&#39;t real. Ukyo
found herself in her own bed, in her own room. &quot;A dream?&quot;
She collapses back down on her pillow, it was just dawn.
The morning sun dimly lights the room.

She feels around the side of her bed and finds a half
empty Chinese food carton. She picks it up and looks at it&#39;s
contents. &quot;Egg fried noodles? No wonder. No more noodles
before bed Ucchan!! (sigh) They give you weird dreams.&quot;
She flings the carton to the other side of her room.
She wanted to go back to sleep, but the dream was still
fresh in her mind, she was restless.

&quot;(Akane.....I&#39;ve never dreamt of you before.)&quot;
She could feel herself slowly becoming aroused as she
thought of her. &quot;(gasp) That&#39;s never happened
before either! (I can&#39;t be attracted to her? Can I?
Ohh...I love her as a friend, nothing more.....)&quot;
She just lay staring at the ceiling, thinking about
the dream. &quot;(All those women......naked. What does it
mean? Am I a.......Am I a.......no, I love Ranma, I can&#39;t
be. But, his female body......it was so....(sigh))&quot;

Then she thought of Shampoo. &quot;(There was love in those
eyes....I wonder if she meant it.) Oh this is STUPID!!
It was only a dream! (sigh) I must be working too hard.&quot;
Her eyes closed a little as the fatigue caught up on her.
She had been out all night celebrating a huge boost in the
restaurant&#39;s profits, not a good idea with school the next
morning. It was early Friday morning.

She was a little hung-over, and really didn&#39;t feel like
school today, she was just too tired. She drifted back
to sleep for an hour or so, but thoughts of her friends
made it hard to stay asleep, she got up.
She was still wearing her underwear from last night.
The stench of second-hand cigarette smoke from them
started to conjure memories of last night.
She kind of remembered something about.....Konatsu....
couldn&#39;t put her finger on it.

She wandered downstairs to the restaurant, to find Konatsu
asleep on one of the tables. She had brought him out last
night despite the fact that he was underage, it took it&#39;s
toll on him, and he collapsed on the table when they
got back. &quot;Konatsu, of coarse, you came with me.&quot;
She goes over to him and gently pushes him to wake him up.
&quot;Konatsu.....Konatsu sugar, wake up.&quot; He was still
out-cold. Ukyo got one of her small spatulas and started
slapping Konatsu on the face with it.

&quot;Konatsu! Wake up!! Come on!!&quot; His eyes start to
ease open. &quot;......huh?&quot; &quot;Good morning sugar!!&quot;
He looks at her for a few seconds before realising
that she is standing over him with little more than her
underwear on. He quickly sits up to attention, his
face was bright red with embarrassment.
&quot;What&#39;s wrong sugar?&quot; His eyes were fixed on her body.
She looks down. &quot;Ohh......You&#39;ve never seen me in just
my undies before?&quot; He nervously nods his head.

&quot;Relax Konatsu! If you ever get a girlfriend your gonna
see a lot more than this! Listen....can you remember
much of last night? Do you know where I got those
noodles from? I hope it wasn&#39;t Shampoo&#39;s place.&quot;
&quot;N..no, a...a Chinese noodle shop, around the corner.&quot;
&quot;Oh, well, remind me never to get take out from there
again. I eat regular noodles from now on!
The stuff I got last night gave me nightmares.&quot;

Konatsu sits up properly on the table. Ukyo decides to
sit beside him, much to his increasing embarrassment.
&quot;So sugar, what did you think of your first night out?&quot;
&quot;Owwww, my head hurts, and my stomach feels like it&#39;s
full of acid.&quot; &quot;Yep! That&#39;s a hangover for you. I&#39;ve
got a little one right now. I wish I were one of those
people who don&#39;t get hangovers. (sigh) Hmmm....&quot;
Ukyo wraps her arm around Konatsu and holds him close
to her.

His face burns bright red as she spoke softly into
his ear. &quot;Konatsu, sugar, you won&#39;t be going to
school today with that hangover will you?&quot;
He nervously shakes his head confirming that.
There was no way he was going to disagree with the
girl he loved, especially if she&#39;s holding him,
wearing nothing but her undies.

&quot;I&#39;m not going in either. How about you work today?
I&#39;ll pay you the full rate.&quot; She said suggestively.
He cautiously nods in agreement. She hugs him
tightly. &quot;Oh thank you sugar! You&#39;re the best!&quot;
She gets off the table and walks towards the stairs.
She stops and turns around. &quot;Oh..Can I ask you one more
favour?&quot; &quot;Sh..sure..what?&quot; He said nervously, trying to
keep his eyes off Ukyo&#39;s body.
&quot;Could you put a sign up at Furinkan High School,
saying that we&#39;re open for lunch today?
Could you do that in the next hour or so,
before school starts?&quot;
He nods his head again.

&quot;That a boy! If your hangover gets
really bad, there&#39;s antacid and paracetimol in the
first-aid box. I&#39;ll see you in a while.&quot;
Ukyo begins to walk up the stairs. &quot;(Hee! Hee! That
kid is something else!)&quot;
She went back up to her room.

--

Time passed slowly. The dawn twilight transformed
into the morning brightness, as the city woke up.
Ukyo got over her hangover, and had managed to wake
herself up, in time to begin preparing the
okonomiyaki. Her job provided a much needed
distraction from her dream. But that didn&#39;t
last forever. She had finished preparing the food,
went out to the counter. She laid her elbows on it,
and used her hands to support her head as she
stared into nothingness.

Her mind was preoccupied by the dream, and especially
Akane. Never before had she felt that way about her.
She tried to shrug it off, Akane was a very good
friend, maybe her best friend, stronger feelings
of friendship are only natural, or so she tried to
convince herself. Could it finally be happening to her?
She thought. After reading about it in magazines,
seeing it on TV and Movies, could she be coming out?
Could she be a lesbian? Or at least bi-sexual?
She did love Ranma, like she always had.
But things seemed different now.

There was something about Akane, something she couldn&#39;t
describe. It was like seeing her in the dream, made Ukyo
feel differently about her, made her have the same
feelings for her as she had for Ranma. Much to her
surprise, she was developing a crush on her.
She tried to shrug it off again, maybe she was thinking
bi-sexual, but it doesn&#39;t mean she loves Akane.
As soon as she talks to her, she&#39;ll see that it was nothing
but a childish fantasy. Or so she tried to convince herself.

--

Lunch time. As sure as midday came, scores of students
from Furinkan High came to  Okonomiyaki Uuchan&#39;s for
their lunch. Despite all the business she was doing,
Ukyo still daydreamed as she took orders and prepared
them. Her mind was somewhere else. Her mind was still
in that temple, with Ranma, and Shampoo....and Akane.
It was really Konatsu who was keeping things going as
he rushed around Ukyo, getting the orders completed.

Then suddenly Ukyo came back to life. Akane had walked
in the door. Ukyo couldn&#39;t control herself as she
blushed a little when she saw her walk up to the
counter, but then her face returned to normal when she
saw the look on her face. Akane was clearly upset about
something. It was like she was dragging a cloud of
dread around with her.

Ukyo&#39;s embarrassment of seeing Akane for real after such
an erotic dream about her, was replaced by genuine
concern for her friend. She put on a brave face and
tried to act cheerfully for Akane&#39;s sake.
&quot;Hi sugar! I was hoping you&#39;d come today! What&#39;ll
you have?&quot; Akane replied in a sombre tone of voice.
&quot;Have you got anything to mend broken dreams?&quot;
Ukyo was taken back by this. &quot;Sugar.....What&#39;s
wrong?&quot; &quot;I messed up. I really messed up this time!&quot;
Akane pounds the floor with her foot, angry with
herself. &quot;Thinking about it, I don&#39;t deserve lunch,
I&#39;ll see you Ukyo.&quot;


Akane turns to leave. Ukyo wanted to do something for
her, she couldn&#39;t stand to see Akane in this state.
&quot;Akane! Wait! Come on, why don&#39;t you tell me about it,
it&#39;ll make you feel better to tell someone.&quot;
Akane replies, still looking at the door.
&quot;You&#39;ll just hate me if I do.&quot; &quot;Nonsense sugar, please,
you&#39;ve got me worried about you.&quot; Akane blushed a
little. &quot;Worried.....about me?&quot; She turns to face Ukyo.
&quot;There&#39;s a booth free over there, you can tell me all
about it.&quot; She nods and goes to sit in the empty booth.
Ukyo prepares a portion of okonomiyaki for Akane and
gets it ready to bring to her. &quot;Konatsu, could you
take care of the orders for a few minutes?&quot;
&quot;At once Ukyo-sama.&quot; &quot;Thanks sugar.&quot;

She walked up to the booth and laid the food in front
of Akane. &quot;Now get that into you sugar, it&#39;ll make
you feel better.&quot; She sits down beside her.
Akane&#39;s mood seemed to brighten a little, as if Ukyo&#39;s
being there, made things better. She ate some of her
lunch before she looked at Ukyo, who clearly wanted
to know what she had to say.
&quot;It&#39;s Ranma.....&quot; &quot;Ohh...what about Ranchan?&quot;
&quot;I did something terrible. Oh, you&#39;ll hate me for this.&quot;
&quot;Come on, tell me sugar, for your own piece of mind.&quot;

&quot;Well....ok. (sigh) I was with Ranma last night,
sitting by the fish pond, it was very romantic,
well...at least I thought so....&quot;
Ukyo listened with increased interest, as a vain
of jealousy shot across her forehead. She liked
Akane, but she wanted Ranma.
&quot;......Well, then we got talking, about stuff,
then I really felt at peace with him....so I
got close to him and tried to reel him in for a
kiss.&quot; A tear forms in Akane&#39;s eye.

Ukyo saw this, and her growing jealously suddenly
vanished, replaced by genuine pity for Akane.
&quot;Go on, sugar. Get it all out.&quot; &quot;(sniff) He....he
didn&#39;t know what to do with me, he panicked, and
pulled away. Normally I might have forgave him, maybe
I&#39;d go a bit slower, and try again.....but....but
(sniff) I lost my head with him, and beat him senseless
for &#39;offending&#39; me.&quot; She begins to cry, she was very
upset about this.

&quot;Sugar, that isn&#39;t so bad, you beat him up all the
time.&quot; &quot;(sniff) No, not like this. I beat him
till he couldn&#39;t resist me, then I tied him up,
then.....then I dragged him into the dojo and
used every weapon I could find to do major damage to
his body. (sniff) He&#39;s so hurt, he has to stay in
bed for a week.&quot; She couldn&#39;t look Ukyo in the eyes
anymore, she began to cry over her food.
&quot;(sniff) He&#39;ll never speak to me again, and
you must hate me now!&quot;

&quot;Akane.....I don&#39;t hate you and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll
speak to you. Sure, he might be afraid of you
for a while. (Bad choice of words.) But...emm,
he does care about you, and you showed him how much
you cared, with the passion you put into his beating!&quot;
&quot;You...you must be loving this, now Ranma will only
want you. (sniff) I don&#39;t have a chance, now!&quot;
Normally, maybe Ukyo would be happy with a better
chance to net Ranma, but not if meant causing her
friend sadness, especially now that she was developing
a crush on her.

&quot;Sugar......I don&#39;t want to see you sad. It&#39;s true,
I want him, but not for this price.&quot; She stopped crying,
and looked at Ukyo. &quot;Y...you mean that?&quot;
&quot;Of course I do...here.&quot; Ukyo gives Akane a table napkin
to dry her eyes. &quot;Cheer up sugar, It&#39;ll be ok.&quot;

Akane&#39;s mood started to brighten a little, this
show of kindness from Ukyo had cheered her up.
&quot;So....where are those friends of yours, that you always
hang out with?&quot; &quot;Yuka got the flu, and Sayuri got it off her,
they&#39;re both out sick. Wh..why weren&#39;t you (yawn) in today?&quot;
&quot;Oh...I was out last night celebrating big profits,
didn&#39;t feel up to school. You don&#39;t look up to it either,
not get much sleep?&quot;

&quot;(yawn) It was weird. I had this strange...dream.
Kept me awake all night&quot;
&quot;D.....dream?&quot; Ukyo started to blush a little.
&quot;It was the strangest dream I ever had. It was
my wedding day, but things went wrong, it was
like you, Shampoo and myself were getting married
but the only groom was Ranma.........Then...
then..&quot; Akane was about to describe the conclusion
of the dream, but stopped herself as she began to
blush at the thought of it. &quot;....the rest is
embarrassing.&quot; They both look each other in the
eyes for a second, only to blush bright red,
and looked away from each other quickly.

Akane had just described Ukyo&#39;s dream.
&quot;(Could she of had the same dream as me?)&quot;
Thought Ukyo. Akane preoccupied herself with
finishing her lunch, it was the only excuse she had
to hide her embarrassed face from Ukyo&#39;s sight.
Soon that passed, and she could look her in the
eye again. She finished her meal and began to look
lost. &quot;I don&#39;t think I can face him. Not for a
while anyway. I don&#39;t look forward to going back
home tonight......&quot;

Feelings of pity flooded Ukyo, she wanted to
somehow make it easier on Akane, she also wanted
a better opportunity to talk to Akane....alone.
&quot;Emm.....Akane, sugar, you could.....stay here
tonight.&quot; This surprised Akane.
&quot;You....really? But there can&#39;t be enough room,
I&#39;d never dream of imposing on you.&quot;
&quot;Not at all sugar, you can stay in my room,
with me, there&#39;s plenty of space. C&#39;mon
Akane! I&#39;ll help you get over this!
We&#39;ll have a girl&#39;s night in! Hee! Hee!&quot;

&quot;Well......Ok, we&#39;ll see. I&#39;ll have to go back
home to get some stuff, after school.&quot;
&quot;Sure thing, come over at about closing time,
then the fun begins! I&#39;m not resting till I
see you smile again!&quot;

The students begin to leave in droves.
&quot;Looks like lunch break&#39;s over....
you better get going Akane......I hope
to see you tonight.&quot; &quot;Y...yea, I&#39;ll see you.
Thanks for lunch...&quot;
Uyko watched her as she left in a hurry, and
went down the street.

&quot;Oh well, back to work.&quot; She gets out of the
booth to see Konatsu slumped over the counter,
exhausted. &quot;Come on sugar! We have to get ready
for the dinner crowd!&quot; Ukyo picks him up and
drags him into the kitchen.

--------------------

Midday turned to evening and then to dusk.
Daylight left the city of Tokyo, and was replaced
by it&#39;s many lights. Uuchan&#39;s had closed down for
the evening. Ukyo slowly pushed the bolt which
locked the door, then sat in one of the booths,
slowly sipping a cup of coffee, to keep herself
awake.

The restaurant was empty and dark, brightened only by
what little daylight there was outside and the counter&#39;s
lamps. Konatsu was in the kitchen, drying the dishes.
He comes out to check on Ukyo. &quot;You okay?&quot;
&quot;Yea sugar, I am. Just thinking about something.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m pretty tired, so I&#39;m going up to bed soon. Is there
anything I can get you.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s sweet of you sugar, but I&#39;m okay. I&#39;ll see you
in the morning.&quot; &quot;Good night Ukyo.&quot;

He leaves a few minutes later and goes upstairs. Ukyo
watched the steam rise from her drink, as she thought about
the dream, and Akane. She knew Akane would be late, but she
had some doubts on weather she&#39;d come.

----------------

Akane was still at home. She was in her bedroom, staring
at the wall. Her room was dark; there were no lights on,
just the twilight of dusk broke through the darkness,
and into her room. She sat on the side of her bed,
with an overnight bag beside her.

Thoughts of Ukyo filled her head. Last night, she had
the same dream as Ukyo, an inexplicable shared dream.
In it she went to the same temple to the same wedding ceremony.
The only difference in her dream, was that it was Ukyo, who had
lowered her to the ground. It was Ukyo who lay over her.
It was Ukyo who had kissed her.

She touched her lips. It was as if they had a memory of
Ukyo&#39;s touch. She had never kissed Ukyo, but she could
remember the moisture and softness of her lips, as if she
had always known how they felt. The thought of Ukyo&#39;s
naked body had as powerful an effect on her as
her lips. Every small detail, every curve and
contour, came to her in perfect detail.

It brought feelings she had only ever felt when looking at
Ranma&#39;s female form. For years she had beaten down a side
of herself that she was ashamed of, deep inside she was a
lesbian. Only recently have these feelings surfaced in
her, after seeing Ranma, the guy she loves, become a
woman, she found herself becoming attracted to women
again, and then she had that dream.

These thoughts kept her awake this morning, just
like Ukyo. She had gone to school to see her, maybe
even talk to her about the dream. But of coarse,
she wasn&#39;t there. So she went to her restaurant,
knowing it was open for lunch. She was very nervous,
about meeting Ukyo again, after that dream. Especially
after what she had done to Ranma. But....Ukyo showed
great kindness towards her, and understanding.

She didn&#39;t say any more about the dream to her,
out of respect for her. After that, Akane had begun
to feel a growing sense of.......love, for her friend.
She felt conflicted though. She loved Ranma, with all
her heart, but that heart was being filled by someone
else, by Ukyo.

She knew what going to Uyko&#39;s tonight would mean.
She knew what she might do if the opportunity
presented itself. She could lose her friend
tonight, or lose Ranma if she became more than a
friend. Her heart told her to go to Ukyo&#39;s, her head
told her to stay at home.

It was times like this, that she wished that her
mother was still alive. To have someone to give her
advice on life and love. But Akane was never one to
hesitate, just because she didn&#39;t know what to do.
She picked up her bag, stood up, and left the room.

------------------

It started to get late. All that was left of
the day&#39;s sunlight was a dark red haze,
hugging the horizon. Ukyo was still sitting
in the booth, the very same booth in which she was
with Akane earlier. She was half way through her
third cup of coffee, when she let out a disheartened
sigh. &quot;(She isn&#39;t coming.)&quot;

She picked up her coffee, got out of the booth
and slowly walked over to the light switches.
She lets out another small sigh, as she about
to turn off the counter lights.
Just then she heard light tapping on the window.
She stopped, and looked out.
It was Akane.

Ukyo set down her coffee and jogged over to the
door to let her in. As soon Ukyo opened the door,
she jumped out and hugged Akane.
&quot;AKANE! I&#39;m so happy you came!&quot;
She looked Akane in the face, only see how
embarrassed she was of being held by her,
so suddenly. Ukyo stepped back from Akane.

&quot;Opps. Sorry. I should have warned you, before I
did that! Hee! Hee! Please...come in.&quot;
She sees Akane in and locks the door behind her.
&quot;I was worried that you weren&#39;t coming....
Was everything ok at home? Did you speak to Ranma?&quot;
&quot;N..no, I can&#39;t face him yet.&quot;
Ukyo walks Akane towards the kitchen.
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be able to so see him soon
enough, besides, he likes you, he&#39;s not going to
hold a grudge. How&#39;d your dad take it?&quot;

&quot;He overreacted as usual. But not in the way you&#39;d
expect. I was expecting him to be furious with me...
but instead he thinks maybe a hormone imbalance,
caused made me beat up Ranma. He&#39;s
thinking of sending me to doctor!&quot;
Ukyo started to giggle at hearing this. Akane
just looked at Ukyo, she didn&#39;t seem to be happy
about this. Ukyo hung her head and let out a
disheartened sigh.
&quot;Oh...sorry Akane, I&#39;m not helping, am I?&quot;

Akane puts her hand on Ukyo&#39;s shoulder. &quot;No.....your doing ok.&quot;
Akane smiled a little for Ukyo. They look each other in the eye
for a few seconds, and just stared silently at each other.
They blushed a little as memories of the dream
came back to them. It was like some kind of tension
between them, had just lifted.

Akane suddenly pulled her hand away, and much to Ukyo&#39;s
disappointment, she pulled away from her completely.
It was just like last night when Akane was with
Ranma, if Ukyo didn&#39;t reciprocate, she may hurt
her too, she couldn&#39;t let that happen.
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Said Ukyo, surprised at Akane&#39;s
reaction.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s....nothing, I&#39;m just under a lot of pressure.&quot;

&quot;Listen sugar, you go on up to my room and get changed
to your nightshirt, and I&#39;ll lock up down here. Ok?&quot;
&quot;Sure....Where&#39;s Konatsu?&quot; &quot;Oh he&#39;s asleep....he won&#39;t
be bothering us. Hee! Hee! You should have seen him this
morning!&quot; &quot;Huh?&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll explain later, go on sugar,
get up there!&quot; She herds Akane to the stairwell.

------------------------

Late Night, about 1 AM. The girls had settled in Ukyo&#39;s
room. They were both in their nightshirts, Ukyo wore
a plain blue one, while Akane wore a more casual one,
with the words &#39;Anything Goes&#39; written on it in her dojo&#39;s
colours. They sat on Ukyo&#39;s bed listening to music on the
radio. Ukyo had managed to get Akane to relax, and
entertained her with tales of what she could remember of
her night with Konatsu.

&quot;.....and then in one bar, I think, I convinced Konatsu
to try and chat up this blonde cutie. Well....guess what
happened?&quot; &quot;What? I don&#39;t know. She told him no?&quot;
&quot;Worse! She slapped him on the face, and stormed off.
Later, I found out, she did that because she thought
he was a lesbian chancing her luck!!&quot;
They both burst out laughing.
&quot;Ha! Ha! Ha! Aww, the poor guy! No one believes that he&#39;s
a guy! How&#39;s he ever gonna get a girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;Oh he&#39;ll manage, I expect he might be like Ranma when he
gets older, well....maybe not, but he&#39;ll do ok.&quot;
&quot;(sigh) The things you&#39;ve done for him...your like his mother.&quot;
&quot;Hey, after being held captive by his step-family, anything
else I can do for him is child&#39;s play...ohh, those women
smelt so bad.&quot; &quot;I know, they caught me too, remember?&quot;

&quot;How could I forget...&quot; Ukyo put her hand on Akane&#39;s shoulder.
&quot;...and I&#39;m glad you were there with me. If I could choose
anyone to be tied up with me, it would be you, sugar.&quot;
Akane smiled and blushed a little.
&quot;Ukyo, can I tell you something personal? Not to tell anyone
else?&quot; &quot;Emm, sure, go ahead sugar, I won&#39;t tell anyone,
not even Konatsu.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s...it&#39;s about my dream last night.&quot; Ukyo began
to blush. &quot;Go on.&quot; &quot;I told you that it was about me marring
Ranma, and that you....and Shampoo were there also getting
married. Well...something happened in it. Something, weird
and kind of frightening. First, the priest turned into a
naked woman, then Ranma turned naked, in his girl form,
then.....you and Shampoo, were naked.
I...I got frightened so I ran, but then all the guests turned
into naked women, then I was naked.&quot;

She looked at Ukyo. &quot;Then....then you lowered me to the ground,
and........kissed me.&quot; Akane looked back down at the floor,
she was too embarrassed to see Ukyo in the eye.
&quot;Weird dream, huh? It&#39;s been bugging me all day.&quot;
&quot;Emm, sugar, I was going to tell you earlier, but you were
too upset...&quot; &quot;Huh? What Ukyo?&quot;

&quot;(sigh)I had the very same dream as you last night. Except
our roles were reversed, you pinned me to the ground, and
kissed me.&quot; Akane looks at Ukyo, with surprise.
&quot;(gasp) You did?! No way! Have...have you been
thinking about it all day too?&quot; &quot;Yea, it was my idea of a
dream wedding, well.... at least till it became some weird
lesbian fantasy.&quot; Ukyo gets up from the bed and starts
pacing up and down the room , pretending to have a bouquet
in her hands. &quot;(sigh) Just like I always imagined how I&#39;d
marry Ranma....well, the wedding part anyway.&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t seeing me and Shampoo naked bother you Ukyo?
I&#39;ve been thinking about it all day. What about our kiss?&quot;
&quot;Ohh...All part of a wonderful dream. Not real life, but
nearly as good.&quot; She said as continued to march up and down the
room as if she was at her wedding. Akane stood up in surprise
and faced Ukyo who stopped marching, just short of her.

&quot;You...liked it?&quot; &quot;It was scary when I was dreaming,
it was kind of like some nightmare Stephen King might write,
but I&#39;ve been thinking about it all day, and...well, it was
kind of sensual. Your lips were as soft as I always imagined,
and you were so cute naked. Most guys would have killed to
be that close to you, but I got it all in a dream.
I&#39;m really lucky that your my friend sugar.&quot;

Akane was taken back by this, and more so by the very
affectionate way Ukyo was looking at her now.
Uyko, took one step closer to Akane.
&quot;Sugar, Akane, that dream we sort of shared, it&#39;s made me think
differently about you. You know, it&#39;s like I feel more for you,
as much as I feel for Ranma. I never thought I could be
attracted by a female body, but (sigh) it&#39;s happened....
Akane, think I....Akane, I.....&quot;

Akane didn&#39;t need to hear it; she could see it in Ukyo&#39;s eyes.
She was a bit nervous, but that passed, she was always one to
act on her feelings, so she beat down her shyness, and did
something she had wanted to do to Ukyo for some time now.

Much to Ukyo&#39;s surprise, and delight, Akane stepped forward,
right up to Ukyo, gently wrapped her arms around her, and
closed her eyes as she moved her head closer to Ukyo&#39;s.
Ukyo closed her eyes in anticipation, of Akane&#39;s touch.
Soon it came, those soft lips she dreamt about, pressing
against her&#39;s, they were softer than she thought.
Ukyo wrapped her arms around Akane, as she held their
embraced together. Akane pushed her tongue into
Ukyo&#39;s mouth, and began to massage the inside of it.
Soon both tongues were playfully wrestling each other
for dominance as Ukyo returned Akane&#39;s kiss with
as much passion as her.

They stood there together, kissing for what seemed an eternity,
but was only really a few minutes, then they slowly let go of
each other. Ukyo continued to hold Akane&#39;s shoulders as Akane
came out of a trance of pleasure. The kiss said it all for
Ukyo, it cleared her head, and made her realise how she really
felt for Akane.

&quot;Oh...Ukyo...that was....Ohh, I love you Ukyo. I always have.
If I had know you like girls, I would have done this long ago,
but I gave up on you, but then the dream got me thinking
about you again. I understand you love Ranma,
and that you couldn&#39;t think of me the same way so...&quot;

Ukyo interrupted her. &quot;NO! Akane, I do love you,
I love you as much as I love him, I want you to be with
me. I didn&#39;t realise how much I cared about you until I had
that dream, but now....now it&#39;s different!
I love you, I can&#39;t live without you Akane, you&#39;re like the sugar
of my life!&quot; It was almost like a massive weight had lifted off
Ukyo&#39;s shoulders, she had declared her new found love for
Akane, and wasn&#39;t ashamed of it.

Akane couldn&#39;t believe it, Ukyo loved her.
&quot;Finally...&quot; Said Akane in a reflective tone of voice.
She stepped back from Ukyo and took hold of the hem of her own
nightshirt, and in one fast move, she pulled it straight
off. Akane stood naked in front of Ukyo, all she wore
were her socks. Ukyo began to feel herself become aroused
as Akane spoke. &quot;I&#39;ve waited for this for a long time
Ukyo, to find the right person to do this with me.&quot;

Ukyo tried to keep her eyes off Akane&#39;s body as she
spoke. &quot;Are...you sure? Don&#39;t you want to save yourself
for Ranma?&quot; Akane took Ukyo&#39;s hands and clasped them
together between her own.
&quot;I&#39;ve been saving myself for someone who truly loves me.
Ohh, I&#39;ve waiting so long, hearing other people saying
how great sex is, and me not getting any of it, because I
was waiting for the right person to come along. That&#39;s you
Ukyo, your that person, and tonight&#39;s your lucky night!&quot;
Ukyo began to hesitate a little, which saddened Akane.

&quot;You...you don&#39;t want me. (sigh) Who was I kidding, who
would want make love to a violent bitch like me?&quot;
&quot;No sugar, it&#39;s not that, it&#39;s just, I didn&#39;t expect to
go all the way tonight. Most couples do it after the third
or fourth date, I was expecting to wait for you. That
kiss was a really big step for me. I never thought I
was a lesbian before today. But to go from kissing to sex.
I&#39;m a little afraid.&quot;

Akane calmed down a bit. In the excitement, she had
forgotten that Ukyo was new to thinking her way.
&quot;Oh...I&#39;m sorry Ukyo, I didn&#39;t realise... Your still
a virgin, aren&#39;t you?&quot; She nodded her head, almost
too shy to speak. &quot;(Sigh).....All my accomplishments,
and I still haven&#39;t managed to get anyone in the sack.
I tend to get really shy, like I&#39;m afraid to show myself.
Like you, I was waiting for someone special, I thought
that was Ranma, someone who wouldn&#39;t make fun of.....
my body. I&#39;ve never told anyone, but he&#39;s the only
guy I&#39;ve know who&#39;s said I was cute and meant it.&quot;

&quot;Aww, I never knew. I always thought you were cute
Ukyo. Cute and sexy.&quot; &quot;Really sugar? Do you mean that?&quot;
Said Ukyo blushing. &quot;You know I do. I never said it out
loud because I thought you were straight. Listen...
If you don&#39;t want to, I&#39;ll understand, I know I
haven&#39;t got much patience, but I&#39;ll wait. Wait
for when your ready for me.&quot;

Ukyo mood brightened up a little. It was always her who
was trying to cheer people up, and now it was Akane who
was doing that for her. &quot;Sugar...thank you. That made me
feel a lot better. Emm...&quot; She began to blush bright
red. &quot;...you know Akane, I feel really relaxed with you
right now. How about.....we do it after all.&quot;
&quot;Huh? You mean?&quot; &quot;We make love, and end our virginities
together. I think I&#39;m ready, I&#39;ve long waited enough.&quot;
&quot;(gasp) Oh thank you Ukyo!!&quot; She hugs Ukyo tightly.

&quot;Can...can I undress you?&quot; Asked Akane meekly.
&quot;Huh? Well, Ok. But I&#39;m a little shy, so be kind.&quot;
Ukyo blushed a little as Akane slowly unbuttoned
her nightshirt. She then slowly slid it off Ukyo&#39;s
shoulders, felling it to the ground. Akane stepped
back and looked at her from head to toe. She
started to giggle uncontrollably at the sight of Ukyo&#39;s
naked body.

Ukyo looked at her own body to see what was wrong.
&quot;What&#39;s wrong sugar, is there something funny on me?&quot;
&quot;No it&#39;s not that, it&#39;s just, I&#39;ve been attracted to girls
for so long, I&#39;ve never actually seen one naked in the flesh
like this. Your body was the most powerful image in my dream,
I was hoping to see it for real. You&#39;re really starting to turn me
on Ukyo!&quot; Said Akane as she noticed her own nipples hardening.

&quot;Aww sugar, you set me off this morning with that dream,
I&#39;ve been buzzing ever since! Hee! Hee! It&#39;s surprising what
the power of dreams can do for you......Emm, Akane,
I don&#39;t know how to have sex with a girl, do you?&quot;
&quot;Well I am a virgin Ukyo! But...I did find Ranma&#39;s porno
stash.&quot; &quot;He has one?&quot; &quot;All guys have one if Ranma&#39;s anything
to go by, maybe you should search Konatsu&#39;s room. I&#39;m
sure you&#39;ll find his. Anyway, I&#39;ve been looking at them, and
I&#39;ve learned a few things, but...I don&#39;t know how to do them.&quot;

&quot;Well, we could always just play with each other, find out
what we like?&quot; &quot;Ok, that&#39;s sounds like a plan.&quot; They just stand
there and look at each other with blank expressions on their faces.
&quot;Emm, Ukyo? I don&#39;t know where to start...&quot; &quot;Hmm...Neither do I.
I suppose it&#39;s not that different to masturbating, I don&#39;t know how
lesbians do it, but I expect it isn&#39;t too different.&quot; &quot;You...you
masturbate?&quot; &quot;Well..yea sugar. Don&#39;t you?&quot; Akane just looked back
at her with a blank expression on her face.

&quot;I...see. Ok sugar, doesn&#39;t matter. How about I teach you what
I like to do myself, then that will sort of count, I think.&quot;
&quot;That sounds alright.&quot; &quot;Ok then, first things first, we need to
get started. That kiss we had was turning me on, maybe we should
start with that...&quot; Ukyo walks up to Akane a begins to gently kiss
her. She stops kissing for a second and takes Akane&#39;s
right hand into hers.

&quot;Ok sugar, a good thing to do is for you to feel me while
we kiss.&quot; She takes the hand places it one her own left
breast. &quot;Feel and squeeze my breast, and don&#39;t be shy sugar,
feel any part of me you want.&quot; They continue to kiss as Akane
explored Ukyo with her hands.

Minutes later Ukyo picks Akane up, by the legs and lays her
on her bed. &quot;Ok sugar, lets get going, we&#39;ll take turns.&quot;
Ukyo lay over Akane. &quot;Turns? What do you mean turns?&quot;
&quot;We take turns pleasuring each other, it&#39;s the only way of
doing this I can&#39;t think of...of course I haven&#39;t a clue
really.&quot; &quot;We&#39;re just like a pair a stupid teenagers, learning
how to do it! Hee! Hee!&quot; &quot;We are a pair a stupid teenagers,
learning how to do it.&quot; &quot;Oh yea..&quot;

&quot;Now...just relax, and let me do this.&quot; She lowers herself to
Akane and begins to kiss her. She lightly kisses her on the
lips then moves her way down. She kissed her on the
neck, her shoulders, her breasts, and then her hips.
She stopped and looked at Akane&#39;s vulva.
&quot;Be patient with me sugar, I&#39;ve never played with another
girl&#39;s cunt.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s ok, just do whatever you like.
All I really want is your touch.&quot;

Ukyo inches her index finger into Akane. &quot;Tell me if I get
it right.&quot; &quot;Get what right?&quot; &quot;You&#39;ll see...&quot;
She moves her finger around the walls of her vagina, watching
Akane&#39;s expressions as she did.
&quot;Ohh, that feels so weird, it&#39;s ticklish, but good, I...I
...OHHH!&quot; Akane begins to breath heavily as small pulses of
pleasure pass through her body.
&quot;Ah ha! I&#39;ve found it haven&#39;t I? Your G spot?&quot; She nods
in response. &quot;Good! Now...brace yourself!&quot;

Ukyo presses her lips against Akane&#39;s vulva, and pushes
her tongue into her vagina. The feeling of Ukyo&#39;s
tongue inside of her, was like nothing Akane had ever
felt, she began to make quiet moans as Ukyo worked on her.
Ukyo remembered where Akane&#39;s G spot was, and began to
lick it with the tip of her tongue. This was very new to
Ukyo too, and she was loving it.

Akane was beginning to climax, as Ukyo massaged her spot
with her tongue. &quot;Oh....oh...oh, (gasp)this is too much,
(gasp) I can&#39;t..I can&#39;t OHHHH!&quot; Every nerve in her body
lit up, as waves of pleasure coursed through her like
ripples of water. Every thing that could be turned on was
on, her nipples were as hard as diamonds, her cilt
was erect and hard, and her vulva was full of boiling
hot blood.

She began to breath heavily, as she felt herself bearing
down to an orgasm. She climaxed, and Ukyo could tell as
Akane&#39;s vaginal walls contracted around her tongue.
She pulled out and looked at the flushed expression on
Akane&#39;s face. &quot;Well sugar....that was easy. Did you like it?&quot;
&quot;(gasp) Yea, Ohh, I didn&#39;t know it could feel that good.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it. Want to have a go on me now?&quot;
&quot;I thought you&#39;d never ask.&quot;

They roll around on the bed until Akane lay on top of
Ukyo. &quot;Ukyo, I want to do it differently. I want
to kiss you while I do it. How do you think I do that?&quot;
&quot;Hmm...Oh that&#39;s an easy one sugar; just lay on me the way
you are now, and use one of your hands to finger me, and
don&#39;t be afraid to feel me with your other hand.&quot;
&quot;Me, afraid?! Ha! I&#39;ll have you screaming with pleasure
soon enough!&quot; &quot;Erm...that&#39;s the spirit sugar, I think..&quot;

Akane moves up close to Ukyo and begins to kiss her with
as much passion as their first kiss.
Ukyo went limp, and became submissive, allowing Akane to
do whatever she liked with her. While they kissed,
Akane moved her hands up and down Ukyo&#39;s back, massaging
it as she went, stopping only at her ass, to groap it
firmly. She could tell Ukyo was enjoying this. She could
feel her hard nipples, bouncing off her own, and she
could feel the heat of her vulva, as it filled with blood,
and could also feel the same changes happening inside of her,
as Ukyo&#39;s pleasure, became her own.

Then she moved her right hand down to Ukyo&#39;s
vulva, and gently entered her finger inside. This was very
new to Akane, she practically never masturbated.
She moved her hand around blindly trying to find the
spot Ukyo found in her, seconds later she felt Ukyo&#39;s
hand holding her&#39;s. It gently guided Akane&#39;s hand deeper
inside Ukyo&#39;s vagina and towards a spongy spot on the
wall of it. She had found Ukyo&#39;s G spot. She moved her
finger up and down, and side to side, stimulating it.

Soon, what had happened to Akane, began to happen to
Ukyo, waves of pleasure pulsated from her groin like
waves in an ocean. As well as feeling her spot, Akane
was also cupping Ukyo&#39;s groin with the palm of her
hand, giving Ukyo&#39;s clit a good workout. Ukyo couldn&#39;t
help herself, she had to return the favour, and so she
began to feel Akane&#39;s clit as Akane worked on her.

They could feel it now...both of them. As the pleasure
pulsated though them, they kissed each other even harder,
any moans were muffled by each other&#39;s mouth.
They were both equally aroused as Ukyo skilfully
worked Akane&#39;s clit. (She was a fast learner.)
Soon the waves of pleasure cumulated into one
massive tsunami of pleasure in each of them, which
enveloped their bodies in a split second.
They came as they orgasmed.

Akane fell on Ukyo, exhausted. She had used up
the last ounces of her strength in that last climax.
Ukyo still had some strength left. She used it
to wrap her arms around Akane, and to pull the bed
cover over them. &quot;Huh? Why are you doing that Ukyo?&quot;
&quot;In case Konatsu comes in, also, I want to fall
asleep with you in my arms.&quot;

With that, she throws a spatula from the side of her
bed at the light switch, descending the room into
darkness. &quot;I love you Ukyo, thank you for making love
to me.&quot; &quot;No thanks needed sugar, I really enjoyed that,
just promise to stay with me.&quot; &quot;Of coarse. Emm...I should
be honest with you, about my feelings and all.&quot;
&quot;What&#39;s on your mind?&quot; &quot;Well, I love you with all my heart,
but I also love Ranma.&quot; &quot;I know, so do I.&quot; &quot;(sigh) This is
going to cause us problems, If only we could both marry him,
like in our dream.&quot;

&quot;Hey! That&#39;s not a bad idea sugar!&quot; &quot;Huh? Well......
It would be perfect, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible.&quot;
&quot;Wait...think about it. We&#39;re both engaged to him for
arranged marriages. Both are as valid as each other.
And then there are the marriage laws. They&#39;re part of the
old Shogun cannon of laws. I bet they&#39;re so vague,
that there&#39;s a loophole somewhere that allows
multiple brides.&quot; &quot;You mean...&quot; &quot;We might be able to
marry Ranchan! Both of us!&quot; &quot;Yay!&quot;

They kiss each other lightly as they begin to fall
asleep. &quot;Goodnight Akane Saotome...&quot;
&quot;Hee! Hee! Goodnight Ukyo Saotome....I love you.&quot;
They drift off to sleep, in each other&#39;s arms, while
romantic music softly played on the radio.

--------------------------------

Shampoo was asleep in bed. She was stirring violently.
She was dreaming an intense dream and spoke in her sleep.
&quot;(Ohh......Ranma? Make love to Shampoo Ranma?)&quot;
&quot;(Huh? Spatula Girl? Violent Girl? Why....
Answer Shampoo, why girls here, interrupting
sexy time with Ranma? This too too weird!)&quot;
&quot;(No...Spatula Girl, no kiss me. NO! Violent Girl!
No kiss me there!! Help Ranma! No!! (gasp)
No, Shampoo, (gasp) Shampoo (sigh) Oh...Oh....
Spatula Ukyo, Oh, Violent Akane...Ukyo...kiss Shampoo,
love Shampoo, Akane?.......Ukyo?......Akane?!.....Ukyo?!)&quot;

She woke up suddenly. &quot;AIYA!! AKANE!!!.....Ukyo....(gasp)no.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Well there you have it, my first Ranma lemon. I hope
you liked it. Parts 2 and 3 are on the way.
What is happening with Shampoo?
What is the deal with that Marriage Dream?
Will Ukyo and Akane&#39;s relationship last?
Will they get to marry Ranma like they dreamed?
Will Ranma even agree to that?
And will Konatsu ever get a straight girlfriend,
looking like a girl himself?

The answers to some of these and more in the
