<h2>A Small Two  of  Piece</h2>
<p><em>Run through the cold  of the night</em><br />
  <em>As passion burns in  your heart</em><br />
  <em>Ready to fight, a  knife held close by your side</em><br />
  <em>Like a proud wolf  alone in the dark</em><br />
  <em>With eyes that watch  the world</em><br />
  <em>And my name like a  shadow</em><br />
  <em>On the face of the  moon</em></p>
<p><em>Broken mirror, a  million shades of light</em><br />
  <em>The old echo fades  away</em><br />
  <em>But just you and I</em><br />
  <em>Can find the answer</em><br />
  <em>And then, we can run  to the end of the world</em><br />
  <em>We can run to the end  of the world(*)</em></p>
<p><em>Cold fire clenched to  my heart</em><br />
  <em>In the blue of night</em><br />
  <em>Torn by this pain, I  paint your name in sound</em><br />
  <em>And the girl of the  dawn with eyes of blue, and angel wings</em><br />
  <em>The songs of the  season are her only crown</em></p>
<p><em>* repeat</em></p>
<p><em>We met in the mist of  morning</em><br />
  <em>And parted deep in the  night</em><br />
  <em>Broken sword and  shield, and tears that never fall</em><br />
  <em>But run through the  heart</em><br />
  <em>Washed away by the  darkest water</em><br />
  <em>The world is peaceful  and still</em></p>
<p><em>* repeat</em></p>

<h2>Laughter and Tears</h2>
<p>The waiting room was quiet, but filled with the air of  tensed dread.  Ranma paced back and forth  while Akane wrung her hands, stealing glances back at the door to the  examination room.  She really wished Tofu  hadn’t chased them out when they had brought the transformed Zhu Shu in, but  Tofu had said he needed to calm the fluttering half dragon down.</p><p>
  Akane was worried.  She knew Zhu Shu seemed to be happy at her  sudden transformation, not minding at all having grown wings and a tail due to  the Dragon Wine Ai had dosed her with before the fight, but the way she was  behaving was worrisome.  Akane hoped it  was just due to being drunk on the wine, and not something more serious.</p><p>
  She played absently with her braid as they waited,  looking over at Ranma and wishing he’d stop pacing.  She knew he was worried too, and with his own  match coming up with a supposed “old friend” this afternoon, she really hoped  Tofu had good news.  Ranma was already  distracted enough wondering what he had done to anger Ukyo.  He’d told her on the way to the Clinic that  he’d always missed Ukyo’s friendship, and it hurt that his old friend seemed to  hate him so.</p><p>
  Then, they also had to deal with Shan Pu now.  The weeks grace to get used to the fact that  the kawaii Amazon was now a full time fiancée to them both was over, and the  purple haired girl wanted to spend as much time with her Ai Ren’s as she could.  The only reason she wasn’t present was the  fact that she had gone to get Ke Lun, hoping the Amazon’s Warleader could help  Zhu Shu.</p><p>
  Akane sighed, looking at the door again before  returning to musing about the missing Amazon.   It wasn’t that she wasn’t interested, she <em>had</em> promised to marry her, and she certainly found Shan Pu  appealing, but it was just so complicated.   The girls at school weren’t calling her a pervert to her face after the  little ultimatum she’d given them in the gym, but it was obvious she was being  looked at differently by them.  Sayuri  had started out lunch pestering her with so many questions on what it was like  with another girl that Akane had almost lost her temper.  Fortunately the fight between Zhu Shu and Ai  had distracted everyone.    </p><p>
  Then there was the fact that she’d just spent a week  dragging female Ranma off to her bedroom after school, and she could  unequivocally say she enjoyed having sex with another girl immensely, which  added another factor in Shan Pu’s favor.  </p><p>
  The problem was Ranma.   Something she was actually surprised to say.  He’d been rather non-committal on the Amazon…  though he had certainly enjoyed looking at her.   Akane smiled at the memory of teasing him  about his wondering eye.  A few months  ago, she’d have been furious at him for looking at another girl.  </p><p>
  But now that she knew without a shadow of a doubt that  he really did love her, she didn’t mind.   He wasn’t great at saying it, but since she’d finally learned to read  him a little, he gave her a thousand small signs a day that he was  wholeheartedly hers.  It made up for a  lot of the utter lack of social skills Ranma had, and the reluctance he had at  actually admitting to having feelings.   He joined her every morning now for sparring, giving her his undivided attention  as she taught him the techniques she’d inadvertently copied from Zhu Shu, and  in turn he was teaching her the advanced forms of their own family’s  school.  It really made for a wonderful  way to start the day.</p><p>
  She smiled at Ranma as he whirled for another trek  across the room, recalling that most of the morning sparring sessions this last  week had also resulted in rather intense, and far too short, bouts of  loveplay.  Such a far cry from getting  woken up every morning to the crash of Ranma sparring with his dad.  Genma had actually had two whole days of  sleeping late before Nodoka decided to put a stop to that, and made Genma work  out with her in the garden while Ranma and Akane were in the dojo.  And this morning, Zhu Shu had come in for her  kata just as Ranma and Akane had been finishing up, and the pair had laughed at  her slow head shake at finding them in a tangle.  Ranma had blushed furiously, but Akane had  just giggled, surprising herself with her utter lack of  self-consciousness.  Between becoming a  bunny girl, and the lingering fragments of Zhu Shu’s memories, she had a  completely different attitude towards sex than she’d had when Ranma had  inadvertently seen her naked that first time.   She’d started to realize it was just part of what people in love did to  express their love for one another.  If  she hadn’t known that Zhu Shu would refuse, she’d have invited her to join  in.  Ranma certainly would have no  objections to her…</p><p>
  But what about Shan Pu?</p><p>
  Doctor Tofu’s arrival brought her out of musing to  blink at him.  “Is Zhu Shu okay?” she  asked in tandem with Ranma.</p><p>
  “I really don’t know dragon physiology well enough to  be certain,” Tofu said, shaking his head.   “But she’s exhibiting all the signs of being drunk.  Other than that, she seems extremely healthy.  Her over all Chi signature is very strong,  though it has some puzzling aspects.”</p><p>
  “But is she okay?”   Akane asked urgently.</p><p>
  “She’s sleeping now, after flittering around my  examining room in a happy bliss.  I think  she’s rather pleased at being able to fly.”</p><p>
  Ranma laughed in relief.  “You think?   It’s all she’s said for a half hour.”</p><p>
  “I doubt she’s coherent enough to formulate any other  thoughts, Son-in-Law.” Ke Lun said as she hopped into the office on her  stick.  “Shan Pu mentioned Dragon Wine?”</p><p>
  Akane nodded, glad the old woman’s curse had been  unlocked as well.  Ke Lun as a bunny girl  was just… too disconcerting.  “Ai slipped  it into her thermos before lunch, then challenged her to a re-match.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun nodded.   “Dragon Wine is a potent brew.   Even very small amounts can intoxicate.”   She sighed.  “Very well.  I will look after her.  You two have school.  I have already sent Shan Pu back.”</p><p>
  They both looked towards the door to the other room,  then at the raised eyebrow of the old woman and bowed.  </p><p>
  “Yes, Great Grandmother.” they said in unison again.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>It had been about ten minutes earlier that Shan Pu had  burst into the building Ke Lun was setting up as a restaurant.  She had taken several minutes to calm down  enough to actually get the story out, and wanted Ke Lun’s permission to call a  blood feud against the cheerleaders.  It  had taken Ke Lun’s explicit refusal to make her stop trying to find the boxes  with all the weapons.  She’d had to  remind Shan Pu that they were in Japan, and she needed to learn to  co-exist with these barbarians.  If Zhu  Shu wanted the cheerleaders dead, that was for Zhu Shu to decide.  Shan Pu hadn’t taken it gracefully, so Ke Lun  had punished her by sending her back to school rather than allowing her to  accompany her to the clinic.  However,  she wasn’t going to be cruel needlessly, so sending Ranma and Akane back now  they knew Zhu Shu was going to be okay would alleviate Shan Pu’s worries over  her Blood-Sister, and remind them they also had responsibilities they had to  tend to.</p><p>
  Ke Lun nodded as the pair went out the door.  “Good, at least in a crisis, they are  obedient.”  She commented before turning  back to Tofu.  “Now where is the  patient?”</p><p>
  “This way.”   Tofu said in Mandarin.</p><p>
  “You speak Chinese?”</p><p>
  “Mandarin and Cantonese.  About a third of my patients are from Chinatown.  They  like the fact I’m not just a modern doctor, but that I also practice the old  medicines.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun nodded.   “Wise man.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu had passed out on the examination table and  was snoring loudly, sprawled in an ungainly pose with her wings and tail  hanging down next to the table.  Tofu had  supplied her with a examination gown, but Zhu Shu had apparently ripped it in  half turning in her sleep.  Ke Lun  examined the tear.</p><p>
  “I take it she’s shown extraordinary strength?”</p><p>
  Tofu nodded.   “As well as flight, and the ability to spit some form of organic  napalm.”  He pointed to a pile of  ash.  “That <em>used</em> to be a potted palm.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun nodded, looking at Zhu Shu’s horns.  “Humm.   One long horn on each side, and two progressively smaller ones under  them.  And her ears are quite a bit  longer.”</p><p>
  “And more expressive.   She can move them unconsciously, like a cat’s,” Tofu added.  “Her teeth appear about the same with the  extended upper and lower canines, but they seem to be something that looks like  normal enamel, but is much stronger.  She  bit right through a metal examination mirror when I was trying to get a closer  look.”</p><p>
  K Lun nodded.   “And her hair’s changing color.   The blonde is darkening towards black.   I’d say the magic of the Dragon Wine interacted with her curse.  She was cursed to turn into the form of a  daughter of a black dragon and a human.   I suspect the Wine caused her dragon blood to stir, made it stronger so  more draconic traits came out.”</p><p>
  “Ah.  It made  repressed genes dominant.”  Tofu  nodded.  “I get you.  The magical wine fiddled with the balance  between her curse and the dragon’s magical nature.”</p><p>
  “You’re taking this rather well for a Japanese  doctor.” Ke Lun noted.</p><p>
  “Trust me.  Live  in Nerima awhile and this is far from the strangest thing you’ll see.  Between those darn alien Oni, and the Senshi,  not to mention the occasional devil hunter…”   He nodded towards Zhu Shu.  “Do  you think this is permanent?”</p><p>
  Ke Lun nodded.   “The Wine is already leaving her system and she’s shown no indication of  reverting.  What I want to know is if her  curse is still active.”  She took Tofu’s  kettle from its warmer and tested the water before pouring it on Zhu Shu,  sighing in relief when she reverted to normal form.</p><p>
  “Humm.  I’ve never  actually watched that before.”  Tofu  said.  “Very quick, isn’t it?”</p><p>
  “Yes.  And at  least she can still be herself.”</p><p>
  “Great-Grandmother?”   a sleepy Mandarin voice came from the couch.  Zhu Shu shook her head.  “Ow.   Why is my head pounding?”  She put  her hands to her head.  “And I’m  wet!  What?”  She looked around “I’m at the clinic?”</p><p>
  “The headache is the dehydration caused by alcohol.”  Tofu said.  “Alcohol tends to take water  out of the system.”  He helped the  Chinese girl to sit up and handed her a large glass of water.  “This will help.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded befuddledly and drank.  “How did I get here?  The last thing I remember is fighting Ai, and  then feeling like my body was on fire.”</p><p>
  “She had you drink Dragon Wine, Zhu Shu.  It is a magical brew made for dragons.  I fear it had… side effects.”  Ke Lun said.   “I’m not surprised at the short term memory loss.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu looked down at herself.  “Side effects?”</p><p>
  “On your cursed form.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu raised her eyebrow before she dumped the rest  of the water on her head. Then jumped up in surprise.</p><p>
  “Ow.”  She  turned to look behind her.  “I have a  tail?”  Then she looked higher, “And <em>WINGS?</em>”</p><p>
  Ke Lun nodded.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu blinked and turned back to Ke Lun with a  hopeful smile.  “Um.  Does this mean I can fly?”</p><p>
  Both Ke Lun and Tofu looked down, to where Zhu Shu’s  feet had already left the floor, her wings having started up the moment she had  looked away from them.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu noted the look and then realized what she was  doing.  “I can fly!”</p><p>
  Tofu nodded.   “Yes.  That’s all you would say  when they brought you in.”</p><p>
  “Yes.   Fortunately, you seem sober enough now Grand-Daughter.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu blinked.   “I was drunk?”  She smiled  ruefully.  “So that’s why I can’t  remember much.  I don’t have much of a  head for spirits.  Grandfather caught me  once after I had tried some of my Aunt’s wine, and he said he had to carry me  to bed because I couldn’t stand after one glass.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun smiled.   “I will remember that, and not serve you wine at your wedding.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu laughed.   “Yes Grandmother.”</p><p>
  “Now, put your feet on the floor.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu sheepishly landed.</p><p>
  “I take it then that you are in no way upset at this  happening?”  Ke Lun asked seriously.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head enthusiastically  “No Great Grandmother.  I can fly!   I care not about anything else.    I have dreamed of flying all my life, and for all of my skill and  ability to jump, I’ve been tied to the ground.   No price can be too great for such a wondrous gift.”  She hugged herself in excitement.  “If the price for being able to fly is this  transformation then I gladly pay it.  My  curse shall be a curse no longer.  Not to  me.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun raised her eyebrow.  “That remains to be seen, young lady.  Still, you seem all right for now.  I will write Lo Shen and ask her about  this.  For now, I think you are fine, and  you also have school.  I’ve sent Ranma  and Akane back already, and unless Doctor Tofu has a reason to keep you?”</p><p>
  Tofu shook his head.   “She’s recovered marvelously from the Wine.”  He pushed his glasses back on his nose.  “I suspect switching back to her uncursed  form drove it out of her system.</p><p>
  Ke Lun nodded.   “Very well.  Do you have a spare  dress?” she asked Zhu Shu.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu smiled and pulled out her pack, withdrawing  one of her inexpensive dresses.  “I keep  one of these handy just in case.  I  should have changed before the fight.  Ai  ruined one of my favorite dresses.”</p><p>
  “Very well.  You  have ten minutes to adjust that for your cursed form, then I expect you to go  back to school.  Even an Empress needs a  good education.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu smiled.   “Yes Great Grandmother.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>It only took Zhu Shu eight minutes to convert the  dress to being backless, but she had less success trying to accommodate the  tail, finally settling for having the back go low enough to pass under it and  deciding to forgo panties for the moment until she had time to try and devise a  pair that wouldn’t fall off her in human form.   She’d just stay in cursed form until she got home.  Also, by the time she had finished, she had  learned how NOT to sit.  Apparently, she  was going to need to give up on chairs with solid backs when in cursed form.</p><p>
  The trip to school was incredibly fun though.  After all, Ke Lun hadn’t forbidden her to fly  there, so she’d really gotten a chance to try out her wings.  The passerby’s in the street had had a great  show of a dragon girl doing loops and twists and mid air acrobatics, all while  laughing gleefully.</p><p>
  Finally though, she had landed at Furinkan to find Ai  waiting at the gate.  She gave the  Cheerleader a wary look.  </p><p>
  “What Ai want?” she asked the blonde</p><p>
  “Wanted to make sure you were okay.  We still have a score to settle, but I didn’t  mean for this to happen to you.  I was  just looking for a way to cancel out your Chi abilities so we could trounce  you.” Ai said reluctantly.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu laughed.   “You make Zhu Shu very happy Dragon girl.”</p><p>
  “Um… yeah.   Well, just to let you know, my squad is still sore, Ayeka  especially.  And I’m not that thrilled  myself.  You went and kissed me in front  of the entire school, and no tongues were even involved.  My reputation demands payback.”  Ai’s voice was chilly.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shrugged.   “Still is game.”</p><p>
  “Yeah yeah.   Well just watch your back, Little Miss Dragon Half.  I will put a leash on you yet.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu sighed. “Ai does not need threats.  If want Zhu Shu sleep with, asking would go  farther.”</p><p>
  Ai gave her a leer.   “Asking isn’t any fun.  I want to  make you worship me.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head.  “Zhu Shu not think that much fun.  See how Kodachi act.  No want be like her.”</p><p>
  Ai laughed.   “We’ll see.  One of these days, I  will look down to see you smiling up at me.”   She turned to go, then paused and bent over as she lifted her skirt to  reveal she had nothing on under it.  She  spread her legs slightly and peered at Zhu Shu through them.  Straightening up from the pose, she laughed  at Zhu Shu’s slight nose bleed and entered the school.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu wiped her nose and sighed.  That girl was such a tease.  It would be so much simpler if she would get  over her obsession with dominating her and just ask her out or something.  Glad as she was with the results of this last  fight, this needed to be settled one way or another.</p><p>
  Finally making her way to her class, she sighed again  when the teacher sent her to the hall with buckets for being late, her only  consolation being that Ai was down the hall doing the same thing.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>After the fight at lunch, the entire school wasn’t  about to miss the challenge to Ranma.   Everyone waited with baited breath as the seconds ticked down to the  final bell, then poured out to the athletic field.</p><p>
  What they found was a little puzzling.  At some point after lunch a ring had been  erected, like a normal wrestling ring but the edges had been made of a metal  that shimmered strangely.  The  challenger, Ukyo, stood in the center silently, ignoring the crowd as they  filtered in.</p><p>
  Ranma was waiting outside of the gate for everyone to  get seated before making an entrance, deliberately refusing to size Ukyo up  before the match.  Akane was curious, and  was peering through the gate to the field.</p><p>
  “Humm.  He’s got  some kind of ring set up, and he looks rather pissed.  What did you do to him, Ranma?”</p><p>
  “Nuthin!  I  ain’t seen him in almost ten years.  We  used to be best friends.” Ranma said morosely.</p><p>
  Shan Pu and Zhu Shu finally arrived.  “Sorry late.   Zhu Shu’s day clean classroom.   Shan Pu help.”  Zhu Shu explained.</p><p>
  Ranma looked at her wings, still fluttering and  keeping her at eye level.  “You really  like being able to fly, huh?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded happily.  “Is first time since Zhu Shu be cursed not  care be cursed.”</p><p>
  Ranma shook his head.   “At least you’re happier than I’ve seen you.  Almost bubbly.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu giggled.   “Zhu Shu can fly!”</p><p>
  Ranma rolled his eyes.</p><p>
  Shan Pu had already joined Akane peeking around the  gate.  “Humm.  Ranma fight person with big spatula?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu’s wings missed a beat.  “What Shan Pu say?”</p><p>
  The Amazon looked at her.  “Person Ranma fight.  Have big spatula.  Cute too.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu’s feet touched the ground as she stepped  towards the gate, almost like she was afraid of what she’d see.</p><p>
  She stood there transfixed, looking through the gate  as the others began to worry.</p><p>
  “Zhu-chan?”   Akane asked.  “What is it?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu’s eyes didn’t leave the ring, but her wings  shifted her hair out of the way as her tattoo faded into view.  Shan Pu and Ranma looked at each other,  puzzled.</p><p>
  Then Shan Pu’s breath caught.  “Is exact same.”</p><p>
  “What?”  Ranma  asked.</p><p>
  Shan Pu pointed to Zhu Shu’s tattoo.  “That.”</p><p>
  It took a second for Ranma’s eyes to focus on just the  spatula, since Zhu Shu so rarely showed her tattoo.  “Okay.”   He looked over her shoulder to where Ukyo was still waiting  impassively.  “You’re right.  It is the same.  So?”</p><p>
  Akane bopped him lightly against the back of the  head.  “Dummy.”</p><p>
  Ranma looked at her.   “What?”</p><p>
  “Her tattoo shows things.”  Akane said.   “Don’t you remember…  oh wait,  that was what she told me and Rei.”   Akane looked sheepish.   “Sorry.  I thought you knew.”</p><p>
  Ranma shook his head.   “Nobody tells me nothin’.  So what  does this tattoo show?”</p><p>
  Akane pointed to the flower.  “Ying-Ying, her first love, is symbolized by  the cherry blossom.  I’m symbolized by  the tiger.”  She smiled.  “Ergo the swords the she just gave me.  These other two items I think represent who  else she’s going to be in love with.”</p><p>
  “Marry.”  Zhu  Shu said softly.  “Ying-Ying say marry.”</p><p>
  Ranma, Shan Pu and Akane looked down at the boy in  disbelief.  “But you hate boys.”  Ranma said to Zhu Shu.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Yes.   Zhu Shu not desire <em>boy.</em>” she  said sadly, her eyes never leaving Ukyo</p><p>
  “Hey, no-one’s making you marry anyone you don’t want  too, Zhu-chan.”  Ranma said firmly.  “If you ain’t marrying us, you’re going to  have the best person we can find.”</p><p>
  Akane and Shan Pu nodded.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu’s eyes finally closed as she lowered her head  and sighed.  “Zhu Shu thanks, but does  not think Ranma can stop what Dragon do.”   She took a step forward.  “For  now, Ranma must answer challenge.”</p><p>
  They walked into the athletic field to cheers and  whistles of appreciation, Ranma proceeding to the ring as the girls set down in  the front row.  Ukyo’s glare never left  him the entire time.</p><p>
  “Well, you two timing womanizer.” Ukyo said as Ranma  entered the ring.  “Are you prepared to  die for your crimes against women?”</p><p>
  Ranma raised his eyebrow.  “Huh?   What crimes?”</p><p>
  Ukyo pointed to the girls.  “You force your fiancée to sit with your  mistress?  What crimes indeed.  You have a long history of such crimes.”</p><p>
  Ranma gave Ukyo a questioning look.  “I don’t get you.  Akane and Shan are both my fiancées.  Gramps set it up.  I ain’t got no choice about it.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu groaned as both Akane and Shan Pu glared at  the oblivious boy.</p><p>
  “So, you even admit you care nothing for them.  Smashing the life from you will be a  pleasure.”  Ukyo took a stance with his  spatula.</p><p>
  “Hey, I never said I didn’t care.”  Ranma spat back.  “What is up with you?  We used to be friends.  Why are you so angry?”</p><p>
  Ukyo’s eyes glittered.   “You ran off and left me behind!”</p><p>
  Ranma scratched his head.  “Huh?”</p><p>
  “I’ve hunted you for ten years.  Now I find that you haven’t changed a  bit.  Defend yourself!”</p><p>
  Ukyo lunged forward with the spatula, coming nowhere  close to Ranma.  He sighed.  “Look, I don’t know what you think I did, but  I don’t really want to have to fight you.”   He dodged another strike just as easily.</p><p>
  “You think words will make up for what I have  suffered!?!”  Ukyo screamed.  “I want blood!”  In a blur he pulled a handful of smaller  spatulas from his bandolier and launched them at Ranma.</p><p>
  Shifting momentary into combat time, Ranma caught them  and tossed them back.  “You don’t have  anywhere near the speed to really hurt me Uc-chan.”</p><p>
  “Stop calling me that!   You lost the right to call me that ten years ago when you left me  behind!”</p><p>
  Shan Pu was watching the fight with a curious  look.  Akane finally noticed it and  nudged her.  “What’s up?”</p><p>
  Shan Pu shook her head.  “Boy not move right.”  she said.</p><p>
  Ukyo meanwhile had changed tactics and had tossed a  bag down, filling the ring with a cloud of flour.  Caught unawares, Ranma fell into a coughing  fit.  Ukyo took advantage of it to catch  him in what at first appeared to be a blanket, but was revealed to be  okonomiyaki dough.  With a laugh, Ukyo  tossed him onto the metal rim of the ring.   The immediate hissing revealed that it was a giant griddle.</p><p>
  “Hey!”  Akane  yelled.  “You hurt him too bad, you gotta  deal with us!” She looked over at Shan Pu and Zhu Shu, “Right?”</p><p>
  Shan Pu glared at Ukyo, but Zhu Shu was just looking  at her feet.  Akane raised an  eyebrow.  “Hey, Zhu-chan.  You okay?”</p><p>
  She got a small nod in reply, but it was easy to see  the dragon girl was depressed.  Akane  resolved to talk to her after the fight, and turned back just in time to see  Ranma shred the dough he was being cooked in.</p><p>
  “Okay, Uc-chan, you keep this up, you’re going to make  me angry.  Why are you so mad?”</p><p>
  “You should know!   You were the one who left!  You  just waved and laughed as I ran after you begging you to stop.  You ruined my life!”</p><p>
  Ranma blinked.   “Huh?  I don’t remember that.  I… mean I remember us leaving, Dad pulling  your yattai while you ran after us waving, but dad said you were waving  goodbye.  I couldn’t hear you.”  He stopped, struck by a thought.  “Why was my dad dragging your dad’s yattai?”</p><p>
  “That was the price, you idiot!”</p><p>
  “Price?”</p><p>
  Shan Pu nodded.   “Know what wrong.”  She jumped up  and landed between Ranma and Ukyo.  “Shan  Pu watch fight.  Ukyo not move  right.  Want know, why Ukyo pretend be  boy!”</p><p>
  “What?  I…”  Ukyo’s eyes narrowed.  “I don’t know what you mean!”</p><p>
  Shan Pu growled and before Ukyo could move, she  reached out and tore open the front of Ukyo’s tunic, revealing the well  developed breasts that had been hidden under a bandage.  “You girl!   Why try hide!”</p><p>
  The entire school gasped.  Two sets of bare breasts in one day was  unheard of.  Most of the boys fainted,  having already lost so much blood earlier.   The rest of the school started buzzing.</p><p>
  Ukyo covered her breasts.  “Because I have to!  Because of him!  He’s made me live my life as a man ever since  he ran out on our engagement!”</p><p>
  Dead silence descended across the field as everyone’s  jaw dropped.</p><p>
  “En...en.. engagement?” Ranma finally choked out.</p><p>
  “Engagement!  My  Dad arranged it with your Dad, and gave up our family yattai as dowry!  Then you stole it and left me behind!”</p><p>
  Shan Pu raised an eyebrow.  Then turned to Ranma.  “You do this?”</p><p>
  “No!  I mean… I  remember the yattai… but… but… I mean… Jeez, Uc-chan, I always thought you were  a boy!”</p><p>
  Shan Pu gave him a half lidded gaze and didn’t stop  Ukyo as she brained him with the spatula.</p><p>
  “How could you have thought I was a <em>BOY!!!!</em>”</p><p>
  Akane had made it into the ring by this time and  grabbed the spatula.  “Because he’s  rather unobservant.  Now would you please  stop hitting my fiancée?”  She looked at  Shan Pu.  “And you let her?”</p><p>
  Shan Pu sniffed.   “Ranma not know is girl?  Shan Pu  tell after just watch few minute.  How  Ranma not tell?”</p><p>
  “I was only six!”</p><p>
  “I think I can explain.”  a voice said behind them, and they all turned  to see Genma.  “Son, there’s someone I  think you should meet.”  He indicated  Ukyo.  “This is Ukyo, and she’s your fiancée.”</p><p>
  There was the sound of a foot impacting flesh loudly  as Genma began ascending towards orbit, followed by a nearly homicidal Ranma.</p><p>
  “<em>YOU KNEW AND  YOU DIDN’T TELL ME!</em>” he screamed, the sound fading as he passed behind the  fence around the field.  Akane and Shan  Pu looked at each other.  “He is <em>so</em> dead.   If Ranma doesn’t kill him, we should.”   Akane noted.</p><p>
  Shan Pu nodded.   Then turned to Ukyo.  “Ranma is  Shan Pu and Akane fiancée.”</p><p>
  Ukyo fixed her with a glare. “He’s mine!  I’ve spent ten years trying to find him!  The only way I can be free to be a girl again  is if he marries me!”</p><p>
  Shan Pu picked her up by the remains of her  shirt.  “Shan Pu say this once.  Ranma and Akane is hers.  You no try interfere or may need get  violent.”</p><p>
  Ukyo glared.   “Better watch the threats, sugar.   Ranma is mine.  I’ve spent too  long hunting him to just give up!  He’s  going to marry me or die!”</p><p>
  She ripped her shirt free and jumped out of the ring,  landing right in front of Zhu Shu.  Her  eyes met the golden eyes of the dragon girl and for a long second, she couldn’t  look away.  Then she blinked, and turned  away, uncertain of what had just happened.</p><p>
  As she walked away, Zhu Shu sighed sadly, her head and  ears drooping.</p><p>
  Akane looked at her.   “Are you okay?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “Zhu Shu knew she girl when first lay eyes on.  Aura not lie.   Know she somehow connected to Zhu Shu.   Not know how.  Hope be one could  marry, but is girl.”  She looked into  Akane’s eyes, and all the despair that had once been there was back. “And yet,  Zhu Shu see into soul.  Not know how, but  somehow, Ukyo see right back into to Zhu Shu too.  Somehow, Ukyo see all Zhu Shu is… and she  turn away…”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“Okay, yes, I know she’s a new goddess.”</p><p>
  “No, she used to be our nemesis.”</p><p>
  “No I don’t know how she got reassigned.”</p><p>
  “But I already have an assignment!”</p><p>
  “Okay, okay!   Alright!”  </p><p>
  Urd slammed the phone down in disgust, eliciting a  raised eyebrow from Mara.  “What was that  about?”</p><p>
  “Licensing just assigned me as your Mentor while you’re on probation.  Said being the goddess who’s on probation the  most, I should be a good example of what not to do.” Urd said disgustedly.</p><p>
  Mara laughed.   “That’s funny.  Don’t worry  Urd.  I’ll try not to be excess  baggage.  And at least I won’t be an  obstacle anymore.”</p><p>
  Urd sighed.  “I  don’t mind you hanging around Mara… or trying to help, but I’ve got this really  important assignment, and if I fail…</p><p>
  “Demon, Third class.   I know, I snuck a look at your assignment - at least, I vaguely remember  doing it.  I also remember gloating at  the time.  The tables are definitely  turned.  I get made a goddess under you  instead.”</p><p>
  “I still wish I knew how Legend did it.  I’ve heard of gods falling, but I’ve never  heard of a demon becoming a goddess.”</p><p>
  Mara shrugged.   “I don’t know.  All I remember is  his offering me a choice.  He knew  everything about me, Urd.  He looked  right through me and knew my every thought and desire.  He… he took the best part of me and allowed  me to see it, and choose between that and… and…”</p><p>
  Urd nodded.   “It’s okay Mara.  I’m really sorta  glad not to have to fight you anymore, though it’s gonna be weird dealing with  whoever replaces you.  For now though, I  really need to know what you did to thwart me.”</p><p>
  Mara nodded, thinking really hard.  “I remember a Chinese Sorcerer, named Xi’an  Chi.  He’s the leader of a tong… um… I  think it’s Clan Scorpion?  I don’t  remember all the details, but he has some sort of grudge against the Dragon’s  Child.”</p><p>
  “That’s a start.”   Urd seemed to come to some sort of decision.  “Well, you’re assigned to me, so I guess you  may as well come with me.  I have to go  see what I can find out about this wizard.”</p><p>
  Mara smiled.  “You don’t have to drag me around if you don’t  want, Urd.  That’s not saying I won’t be  happy to be near you, but you don’t need to feel obligated.”</p><p>
  Urd sighed.   “Look, Mara, I know you’re in love with me.  I don’t know how I feel about that yet,  alright?  I don’t mind you being around,  and I’m certainly not worried about the fact we’re both girls.  It’s more I don’t know if I’m really ready  for that kind of a relationship yet.  I’m…”</p><p>
  Urd stopped as Mara laid her finger against her  lips.  “Shhhh.  Don’t try to explain, Urd.  Let’s just see what happens, okay?”</p><p>
  Urd nodded.   “Okay.”  She turned towards the  TV.  “Jeez, I’m so much better at this  when it’s someone else.”  </p><p>
  Mara laughed.   “I’ve seen a few of your ‘successes’ Urd.  No you’re not.”</p><p>
  Urd stuck out her tongue.  Mara stuck hers out right back, and they both  started laughing.  </p><p>
  “Alright already.” Urd said when she regained her  composure, “Let’s go.”</p><p>
  The transition through the TV was quick, but Mara was  dumbstruck when they arrived at Yggdrasil.</p><p>
  “I had no idea it was so…”</p><p>
  “Big?”  Urd  supplied.</p><p>
  “Pretty.” Mara corrected.  “I’ve never been here before.  Most of this district of heaven is off-limits  to demons.”</p><p>
  “Well you’re a goddess now, so you’re allowed here.”</p><p>
  “Against my better judgment.”  Peorth’s voice broke in.  “But she <em>is</em> technically a goddess.”</p><p>
  Urd looked over to the sysop station.  “Well, she’s assigned to me, so where I go,  so does she.”</p><p>
  Peorth raised her eyebrow.  “Of course, mon chere.  I would never come between a master and her <em>pet.</em>”</p><p>
  Mara glared.   “Good to see you too, Peorth.  Did  you ever get the smell out of your apartment?”</p><p>
  Urd laughed.   “Come on, we need to go over here.”</p><p>
  Peorth glared after them as Urd made her way to the  substation and closed the privacy shield.   Mara looked at the shimmering curtain.   “I’m surprised the nosy bitch lets you get away with this.”</p><p>
  “She doesn’t have a choice.”  Urd said smugly as she typed away on the  keyboard.  She hit the enter key and  leaned back as a speaker activated.</p><p>
  “Greetings, Goddess Urd.  How are you today?”</p><p>
  “Feeling a bit like you left things out, again.”  Urd grumbled.</p><p>
  “I am limited in what information I can give you,  Goddess Urd.  I do apologize for that,  but I must do as my maker bade me.  A  greetings to you as well, Goddess Mara.  I  have been looking forward to meeting you for a very long time.”</p><p>
  Mara blinked.   “Umm.  Hi?”</p><p>
  Urd looked at the computer.  “You know her?”</p><p>
  “Yes.”</p><p>
  “How.”</p><p>
  “I am afraid I can’t say, Goddess Urd.”</p><p>
  “So it’s another one of those damn mysteries!” Urd  muttered.  </p><p>
  Mara blinked.  “Am  I missing something here?”</p><p>
  Urd scowled.   “Just this damn assignment I’m on.   Somehow, the me from the future has done things in the past, and what  she did is hidden from me, by her orders!”   She gestured to the computer.   “And this piece of annoying code is one of her ‘gifts’.”</p><p>
  Mara nodded.   “Ah.”</p><p>
  Urd sighed.   “Alright Phoenixmoon, give me whatever you know about Xi’an Chi.”</p><p>
  The computer hesitated, something Urd had come to  realize meant something had been unlocked by a trigger phrase, then the privacy  screen went dead black as a hologram shimmered before the computer, resolving  into… Urd.</p><p>
  But it was a much older Urd, her hair as long as her  ankles, and ages upon ages in her eyes.   The hologram focused on the chair where Urd sat and a faint smile  crossed its lips.</p><p>
  “If you are seeing this, then the most forlorn of all  my hopes has come to pass, and you have come here with Mara looking for  information on Xi’an Chi.  It was the  single possibility I could not plan for, but the only one I truly hoped would  be.  If Mara is no longer working against  you, it means that the enemy has lost one of it’s most effective pawns.  It also means that you may face more danger  than you might have otherwise.”</p><p>
  “Beware Urd. The wizard Xi’an Chi is the brother of  Song Lin Tzu, Chosen of the Dragon.  When  Legend favored Song Lin Tzu, he grew jealous of the power of the Dragon, and  became a willing pawn of Chaos.  He is  the tool of Chaos, and you cannot prevail against him in direct combat.  He has powers granted him by Chaos that would  kill even you, Urd. He is Chaos’s primary agent in the mortal realm.”</p><p>
  Urd blinked, looking at Mara as she bit her lip.  Mara gave her a helpless look and  shrugged.  “I didn’t know.” the demoness  whispered.</p><p>
  “However, you are fortunate that Chaos shares her  power grudgingly.” the hologram continued.   “To attain his full power, Xi’an Chi must evoke Chaos.  Without this, he is merely a wizard of  enormous power.  Do what you can to avoid  direct confrontation, as his proxies and servants are far less dangerous.”</p><p>
  The hologram fixed Urd with an intense look.  “You will not be able to avoid him  entirely.  So long as Song Zhu Shu lives,  he will hunt her.  She is the heir to the  Dragon, and linked to him.  If Xi’an Chi  controls her, or slays her, he can wrest the link from her and draw on Legend’s  power.”</p><p>
  The hologram closed its eyes and rubbed its  temples.  “I don’t know how best to  stress this, Urd, but regardless of the cost, this must not be allowed to  happen. If Zhu Shu falls to Chaos then all is lost.” The hologram’s eyes  reopened to look into Urd’s.  “I have  given even my life to see to this.  I  cannot tell you all I have done, but if you are viewing this, then know that in  the end, I failed.  I no longer exist,  and there is only you, my younger self.”</p><p>
  “History has a momentum, Urd.  And the butterfly has to flap its wings at  the exact right time to make a hurricane.   I have flapped for the last time, and I have no choice but to lay this  burden on you.  Phoenixmoon is my last  ditch effort to change what will be, and Shan Pu’s wish is just a part of this  dangerous game you must play.   Phoenixmoon was designed to help you, but there are limits on what it  can tell you.  You do not stand against  just Hild, or Xi’an Chi, but against Chaos herself.  If you know too much, you will become too  large a target, as I have become.  It is  the only chance at safety I can give you.”</p><p>
  The hologram turned towards where Mara was standing, a  sadness nearly unbearable in it’s eyes.   “I wish that I was truly here, instead of a hologram, I wish that you  were truly here instead of only in my memories.   That you are here at all exceeds all my hopes.  Of all the scenarios I have played out, this  is the one I least expected to occur.  It  can only mean that Legend himself has taken a hand, for you were beyond my  power to save.”  The ancient woman held  out her hand. “I have nothing to offer you but a chance that your future may be  better than my past.”  Her eyes returned  to Urd.  “There are many regrets I have,  my younger self.  Many mistakes.  It took me far too long to learn from them.  Whatever you do, I pray you do not make the  same ones I did.”</p><p>
  With a last flare, the hologram faded.  Urd drew a long shaky breath.</p><p>
  “Okay.  It’s one  thing to suspect your future self is meddling in the past.  It’s something else again to have visual  proof.” she said finally.</p><p>
  Mara nodded.   “At least we know you age well.”</p><p>
  Urd gave her an evil eye.  “Thanks.”   She threw her face into her hands.   “What the hell did I get myself into.”</p><p>
  Mara laid her hand on Urd’s shoulder.  “I’m sorry for what I did.  Perhaps if I had not gone to Xi’an Chi…”</p><p>
  “No.  You heard  her... me.  He’s after Zhu Shu no matter  what.  Sooner or later he’d have showed  up.  I just wish I understood what was  going on.  Who is Chaos?  What is this all about?  And what does Shan Pu’s wish have to do with  it all?”</p><p>
  Mara gave her a strange look.  “You don’t know who Chaos is?”</p><p>
  Urd shook her head.</p><p>
  Mara sighed.   “Among demons, from the youngest to the oldest, Chaos is a name spoken  with fear.  She’s the embodiment of  oblivion.  Negation.  The Terrible Master was simply an avatar, a  small fragment of Chaos herself, one I was a fool enough to believe I could  control.”</p><p>
  Urd blinked.   “And Hild?  My mom?”</p><p>
  Mara looked away.   “She is Chaos’s servant.  She  rules Nifelheim, but it is Chaos who rules her.”  She rubbed her wrists.  “She has become like a dark, destructive  version of you.  Seductive, sensual, but  sadistic as well.”  she shuddered.  “She is… impossible not to desire when she is  present.  Even when she was torturing me,  I just…”  She shook her head.  </p><p>
  “So what does the embodiment of oblivion want with the  Dragon’s child?” Urd said, not wanting to pry further.</p><p>
  Mara shrugged.   “No-one ever asks Chaos anything.   She is unseen, but inviting her attention is something no sane demon  would risk.  As we are above amoebas,  Chaos is above us. Some legends say she is a prisoner, and seeks to destroy the  universe so that she can finally be free.   Death and destruction are her hallmark.”</p><p>
  Urd sighed again, not resisting as Mara started  kneading her back.  “Great.  Just great.   As if I didn’t already have enough to worry about.”  She sat for a few moments letting the  ex-demoness work on her shoulders.   “Well, at least I guess I know the answer to one thing after all of  that.”</p><p>
  “Ummhumm?”  Mara  questioned.</p><p>
  Urd look back over her shoulder.  “She at least seemed to return your love, so  I guess eventually, I will too.”</p><p>
  Mara shook her head.   “I don’t know.  All she offered  was a chance, same as Legend.  I think,  if she did, she discovered it too late.”</p><p>
  Urd sighed.  “I  think so too.”  She looked back to where  the hologram had been.  “She didn’t want  me to make the same mistake.”</p><p>
  “So are you going to listen to her?”  Mara asked, the faintest hint of wistfulness  in her voice.</p><p>
  “Considering everything else in my life is going  wrong, maybe I should.”  Urd  frowned.  “Are you still here,  Phoenixmoon?”</p><p>
  “Yes, Goddess Urd.   I was simply allowing you privacy.”</p><p>
  “What can you add to what Mara here just said about  Chaos?”</p><p>
  “That you should avoid her attention at all costs,  Goddess Urd.  She is a force akin to the  Ultimate, and outside of it.   Fortunately, she seems limited to having to work through pawns.  I feel you should be aware though, that I  suspect her influence in a recent happening involving the object of your recent  conversation.   Were you aware that Song  Zhu Shu’s dragon heritage has been strengthened?”</p><p>
  “WHAT!  Why  didn’t you tell me this when it happened!”</p><p>
  “You were occupied helping Mara, and the incident has  not endangered the young lady.  The part  of her that is dragon has simply been manifested more strongly.” The  disembodied voice replied.  </p><p>
  “Friggin computer!” Urd growled as she shut down the  terminal and released the privacy screen.   “Come on, we gotta go see what’s up.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“Are you sure you’re okay?”  Akane asked yet again.</p><p>
  “I’m fine, Akane.”   Zhu Shu replied in Mandarin, unable to even find the energy to try  Japanese.</p><p>
  Akane looked at the newly transformed dragon girl, and  begged to differ.  From her drooping ears  to dragging tail, Zhu Shu looked far from “fine”.  She looked towards Shan Pu for support.</p><p>
  “I don’t even know why you’re upset over that girl,  sister.”  Shan Pu said in Mandarin as  well, still aggravated over the whole thing.   “She’s not worth your time.  You  deserve better.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu sighed, her ears dropping even further.  Akane glared at Shan Pu.  </p><p>
  “I know you’re upset over her claiming to be Ranma’s  fiancée, Shan Pu, but that’s no reason to be so vehement.” she said, accepting  the usage of Mandarin for the conversation.</p><p>
  “She’s trying to take our Ranma!  Why aren’t you more upset!”  Shan Pu fumed.</p><p>
  Akane gave her a look of disbelief.  “Because he is <em>OUR</em> Ranma, Shan Pu.  Look, I  know we’re still working things out, but I love Ranma, and I know he loves  me.  I know you love both of us.  Considering all that, Ukyo doesn’t have a  chance.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu blinked and gave her a half lidded gaze.  “I see.”   She gave a slow smile.  “I guess I  will try to have faith then, beloved.”</p><p>
  Akane gave her a sidelong glance, and noted the smug look  Shan Pu had at her words.  She let the  Amazon have her little victory and turned back to Zhu Shu.  “Is there any way that Ukyo <em>isn’t</em> the one your tattoo is  indicating?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head.  “I looked into her soul, Akane, and she  looked into mine.  I know she’s one of  them.”  She sighed heavily.  “And yet, once more, I cannot marry her,  because she is a woman.  I have to marry  a man and bear an heir.  Neither my  grandfather nor the Amazons will allow anything else.  And I’ve already gone over why I can’t marry  the three of you.”</p><p>
  “So what exactly happened when you looked at  her?”  Akane asked.  “I’m still not sure why you’re so depressed.”</p><p>
  “She <em>rejected</em> me, Akane.”  Zhu Shu said softly.  “She looked into my soul, and she turned  away.  She rejected the connection,  rejected me.  The very attraction she  felt for me was… <em>unacceptable.</em>”</p><p>
  “Aren’t you reading a little much into a few seconds  of eye contact?”  Akane asked.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head.  “You know how I see auras.  Auras don’t lie.”</p><p>
  Akane nodded.   “Okay.  But your tattoo hasn’t  lied either.  Maybe we just have to give  it time.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu sighed again.   “I do not know.  And there is  another thing which weighs upon me.  What  about Rei?  What do I tell <em>her?</em>   Her desires for me have not yet run their course.”</p><p>
  Akane frowned.   “I don’t know.  But surely there’s  no hurry.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head.  “I can not lie to her, Akane.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu laid her hand on Zhu Shu’s shoulder.  “Don’t be so sad, sister.  Somehow, we’ll work it out.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded, and tried to smile, but her ears and  tail betrayed her.  Shan Pu sighed and  stopped at the corner.  “Well, Great-grandmother  is still setting up the cafe, and she will want to know what happened.”</p><p>
  Akane and Zhu Shu nodded.  Shan Pu stepped up to Akane and gave her a  hug and a kiss before she turned and headed off.  Zhu Shu waited till her sister was out of  earshot before commenting.</p><p>
  “I see you’re not fighting her affections.”</p><p>
  Akane nodded.   “I’ve done a lot of thinking the last few weeks.  And… well…   I discovered I like physical affection.   Being a bunny girl has its downsides, but I’ve spent the last week  playing with Ranma almost every day, and I rather enjoy cuddles.  And, Shan Pu is incredibly cuddly.  I’m still getting used to being her fiancée,  but at least I’ve stopped viewing her as a rival for Ranma.”</p><p>
  “Oh?  When did  this occur?”</p><p>
  Akane blushed.   “Um… a few nights ago, when I found myself fantasizing about a threesome  with her as the centerpiece.”  Akane  shrugged.  “I promised Ke Lun I’d stick  to my promise and try to learn to love her, so I guess I just got used to the  fact that she is my fiancée.  At least,  I’m trying not to be as dense as I was with Ranma.”  She laughed.   “Of course, the fact that she’s nowhere near as insulting helps.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu smiled, her ears actually perking up a  little.  </p><p>
  Akane smiled herself.   “Tell you what.  Why don’t you let  me get the class started.  You go up to  your room, and I’ll send Rei up to see you.   That way you won’t have to deal with all of them pestering you with  questions about why you now have wings.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu smiled gratefully.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Neither Ranma nor Genma had made it back to the  Tendo’s by the time they got home, so the house was actually quiet.  Kasumi showed no surprise when they came in,  saying that Ke Lun had stopped by earlier.   She already had a pile of Zhu Shu’s dresses altered and a tea set  waiting for her in her room.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu put the dresses away, making a mental note to  thank Kasumi for being so thoughtful.   She had just poured two cups when there was a gentle knock on the  door.  She rose and let Rei in, standing  behind the door until she had entered, then closed the door.</p><p>
  Rei had been looking at her concernedly, but when she  got a good look, her jaw dropped.  </p><p>
  “Wow.  What  happened to you?”</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu have small accident.  Drink Dragon Wine.  Make dragon side stronger.”</p><p>
  “Really?  Oh wow…  You have wings?  Can you fly?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   She turned to let Rei see all of her.  </p><p>
  “Oh cool, and a tail?”   Rei laughed.  “Cute.  You look like one of those girls from a  Hentai video, but you’re real.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu raised an eyebrow.  “Rei like?”</p><p>
  The Shinto priestess nodded.  “I like <em>you</em>, Zhu-chan.  And I do think it’s sexy.  A little weird, and it’ll take getting used  to, but very sexy.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu smiled softly.   “Thank you.  But Zhu Shu needs  talk to Rei.”</p><p>
  Rei sensed the seriousness.  “Oh, gods.   You’re dumping me right?  We  screwed up so bad in Hong Kong, and…” She  looked at Zhu Shu over the hand the Chinese girl had covered her mouth with.</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu not dump Rei.   Promise Rei she be available as long as Rei want to chase.  But Zhu Shu not want see Rei be hurt.”</p><p>
  Rei blinked at her, then pulled her head back.  “What’s going on?” she asked.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu sighed and set down on the futon.  “Zhu Shu meet someone today did not expect.”</p><p>
  Rei raised an eyebrow.   “Oh?  Who?”</p><p>
  “One Zhu Shu not think meet so soon.”</p><p>
  Rei’s eyes widened.   “Did you met HIM?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “But is problem.  Him is her, and  her not seem want Zhu Shu.”</p><p>
  Rei blinked several times while she translated  that.  “It’s a girl?  Which symbol?”</p><p>
  “Spatula. Ukyo Kuonji.”</p><p>
  Rei’s eyes widened.   “Ukyo Kuonji?  Makes okonomiyaki?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “She hunt Ranma.  Finally find and  fought him today.”</p><p>
  Rei’s eyes turned towards the Dojo.  “<em>I AM  GOING TO KILL HER!</em>”  she  growled.  “I <em>told</em> Usagi not to talk about Ranma with him... I mean her! I  mean... “  She stopped.  “He’s really a girl?  And he was so <em>cute</em> too!  Oh, wait till Mina  finds out!”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu blinked.   “You know Ukyo?”</p><p>
  Rei nodded.  “He… <em>She</em> used to run a restaurant in  Juuban, called Uc-chan’s.  We had lunch  there a couple of weeks ago, and Usagi was running her mouth.  Ukyo seemed awfully interested in Ranma.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded, looking downcast.  “She hunt Ranma because she fiancée.”</p><p>
  Rei facefaulted.   “She’s what!?!”</p><p>
  “When Ranma six, Genma arrange marriage.”</p><p>
  “Wait a minute!   I thought the engagement with Akane took place when they were born?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “But you see problem.  Ukyo is not  only girl, but engaged to Ranma.”</p><p>
  Rei blinked a few more times as she caught the note of  melancholy, then her face grew sad as well.   “Oh, Zhu-chan.  I’m sorry.  I-I know you have to do your duty.”  She sat down by Zhu Shu and reached out for  her hand.  “I-I hope you won’t take this  the wrong way, but I’m kinda glad you finally found one of them.  I-I’ve been dreading this, but now that it’s  happened, I’m kinda excited for you.”   She gave Zhu Shu a smile.   “However, I’m not giving you up yet.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu looked at her.   “Rei not angry?”</p><p>
  “No.  I mean,  I’m having fun dating you… well, I had fun on our one date until… well.  But I’m not letting you go until I’m sure  you’re ready, and I’m sure this Ukyo loves you.”  Rei said firmly.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu smiled, her ears perking up.  “Zhu Shu glad to hear that.”</p><p>
  Rei put her arm around her.  “Hey, I haven’t had the best track record  with dates, but you’re my friend first.   And I went into this knowing I’d eventually have to give you up.  And I promised that when the time came I  wouldn’t raise a fuss.  I’m not ready to  let you go yet, but I resigned myself to it at least several minutes ago.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu laughed at Rei’s infectious grin.  Rei grinned even further.</p><p>
  “I don’t think you’re happy enough” she said, then  pounced, taking advantage of Zhu Shu’s backless dress to tickle her ribs.</p><p>
  The dragon girl collapsed in a helpless heap of giggles,  begging Rei to stop, but the younger girl was merciless.  They rolled around the futon until finally  Rei had Zhu Shu pinned to the bed, her body stretched out on top of the other  girl.  She held Zhu Shu’s hands pinned as  she caught her breath, a small smile playing across her lips.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu looked up into Rei’s face and thought about  how beautiful the priestess was, and how nice it was to feel her pressed  against her.  On top of that, she could  smell that Rei was aroused.</p><p>
  And Rei had just had to tickle her.  Ying-Ying had made a habit of that too, and…</p><p>
  Rei caught her half-lidded gaze and leaned  closer.  “Well, now that I’ve conquered  you, what should I do?” she asked softly.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu took a deep breath and fought against the  first several replies.  Finally she said,  “Not tease Zhu Shu.  She need cold  shower.”</p><p>
  Rei bent down and nuzzled her neck.  “Who says I’m teasing?” she whispered in Zhu  Shu’ ear.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shuddered as she struggled to control the  rising desire.  “Rei not tease.  Zhu Shu…”</p><p>
  Rei stopped her with a kiss.  “I’ve wanted to do this since I saw you doing  kata.  And I’ve seen you struggle with  being around Akane and Shan Pu.”  She leaned  down and nuzzled Zhu Shu’s neck again.   “I had contemplated doing this after our date, and I am certainly not  letting you go to Ukyo without having had my way with you.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu gasped as Rei’s kisses traveled down her  neck.  “Is… is Rei certain wish do this?”  she protested faintly.</p><p>
  Rei answered her by releasing the knots on Zhu Shu’s  dress.</p><p>
  As the priestess’s kisses continued downwards, Zhu  Shu’s resistance crumbled.  She moaned  softly as Rei released the last tie and drew the dress off of her, holding it  up like a trophy.  Rei smiled and draped  it over the side table, then unbelted her hakima and let it fall to the floor  with her yakuta. She grinned.  “I’m not  as well built as you, and I have to wear a bra, why don’t you ever wear one?”  she asked as she reached behind her to undo the aforementioned device.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu stretched.   “Have exercises.  When Rei learn  more, will teach.”</p><p>
  Rei tossed the bra aside, revealing her pert breasts,  and stood to remove her underwear.  Zhu  Shu watched her admiringly as she slid the cloth down her slim legs.  As the panties joined the growing pile of  clothes, she asked.  “Why Rei do this?”</p><p>
  Rei nestled back on the bed.  “Because you need it.  Because I need to answer some questions for  myself.  And because this may be my only  chance.  For right now, you’re still <em>mine</em>.”   She ran her hand along Zhu Shu’s stomach, her fingers sliding downward.  “Let me enjoy that while I can.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu’s answer was to draw her down for a long kiss.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The Chibi Urd jumped down from the window ledge and  dusted her hands off.  That had taken an  unexpected turn, though not an unwelcome one.   She looked at Mara, who’d been waiting under a tree.</p><p>
  “Well, it seems our little priestess has her own ideas  of appropriate therapy.”</p><p>
  Mara nodded.   “That’s to be expected.  I could  tell the girl had the hots for Zhu Shu the first time I saw her.  Surprised it took so long.”</p><p>
  Urd shrugged.   “At least it should help release some tensions.  Still, I think I need to get some more  info.  From what Zhu Shu was just saying,  it seems the Dragon’s Child has some connection to Ukyo.  My briefing only said she was another fiancée  of Ranma, a loose end that I needed to resolve.   That’s part of the reason I got the elders involved.  Ukyo’s claim is based on just Genma’s deal,  without the approval of his father in law or his wife, unlike the engagements  to Shan Pu and Akane.  Nodoka is unlikely  to accept the engagement, since it’s illegitimate, and her father has nothing  to gain by the marriage, and in fact dislikes the Kuonji clan, since Ukyo’s  great uncle is an old rival.  That  basically puts Ukyo’s claim to an end, which should free her finally from  having to hunt after Ranma, and let her go and find another husband.”</p><p>
  Mara raised an eyebrow.  “Um… That’s your plan?”</p><p>
  Urd nodded.   “Yeah, why?”</p><p>
  Mara sighed.   “You’re right, you need more info.   Let’s go back to my old place.  I  think there’s something else I tracked down that you might need.  Let’s see if my notes survived, or even if  they’re coherent.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“When is Rei coming back?”  Usagi whined for the umpteenth time.  “And Zhu Shu?   I wanted to tell everyone what happened.”</p><p>
  Akane sighed.   “When they’re done talking.  Now  try that move again.”</p><p>
  Usagi did the kata in slow motion again, attempting to  imitate Akane’s motions.  Akane  nodded.  “That’s good.  Now try it full speed.” She motioned to the  practice dummy, the one still dressed in a tattered Chinese shirt and a  pigtail.  “Just imagine that’s Ranma, and  try to hit him.”</p><p>
  “With pleasure.”   Usagi visualized Ranma standing there calling her “odango atama” and  moved.  The heel of her hand hit the  dummy with satisfying force.</p><p>
  “Not bad, but you’re making the same mistake Akane  always used to make.”  Ranma’s voice  chirped in as he came into the dojo.   “You don’t need to pack so much force behind the punch.  The secret is precision.”  </p><p>
  He demonstrated with the same move, hitting the dummy  just an inch from where Usagi had, and with a loud crack, the support post  broke.  Usagi grumbled “showoff” to  herself as he turned back to Akane.  </p><p>
  “Sorry I’m late.   I had to chase the panda down and drag him to mom.  She’s going over this ‘engagement’ with him  right now.”</p><p>
  Akane nodded and smiled.  “Good.   I don’t think your mom is going to put up with any nonsense from Genma,  not after this whole Neko-ken stuff.”</p><p>
  Ranma looked around.   “So where’s our dragonfly?”</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu is talking to Rei.  You missed the end of your fight.  Zhu Shu was a little… upset.”</p><p>
  “Oh?  What’s  wrong?”</p><p>
  “She…”Akane stopped and looked at the scouts, who had  all stopped what they were doing to listen.</p><p>
  “Alright guys, back to practice.  If Zhu Shu wants to tell you, she can.”</p><p>
  Ranma shrugged and went back over to help Usagi.  They were just finishing up and about to send  the girls to get changed when Rei finally came back, her hair slightly  disheveled, and wearing a cat eating grin.   Zhu Shu followed her, in her normal form, and rather obviously in a  better mood.  Akane blinked, but the very  faint traces of gold still clung to the edges of Rei’s violet aura, matched by  the faintest hints of purple around Zhu Shu’s.   Then comprehension dawned and she laughed.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu blushed crimson from her hairline to her  toes.  She gave Akane a sheepish  look.  Usagi looked between Akane, and  Rei and Zhu Shu, finally just asking “What?”</p><p>
  Akane laughed.   “Nothing, Usagi.”</p><p>
  Rei almost bounced over to the other girls.  “This is so cool.  You’ve got to see what happened to Zhu Shu!”</p><p>
  She grabbed a bucket of water from the dressing room  and scurried back over to Zhu Shu, who good naturedly allowed Rei to dump the  water on her.  The other girls gasped as  Zhu Shu transformed.</p><p>
  “Wow, what happened to you?”  Usagi asked.  </p><p>
  “Zhu Shu accidentally drink Dragon Wine.”</p><p>
  “Accident my ass.”   Akane interjected.  “Ai snuck it  into her thermos before challenging her to a fight at lunch.”</p><p>
  “Ai did this?” Makoto asked.  “That cheerleader who’s been giving Zhu-chan  a hard time?”</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu is fine.   No upset at Ai.  She not know  would affect Zhu Shu this way.  Besides,”  She fluttered her wings and lifted off the ground.  </p><p>
  “Zhu Shu can fly.”   Akane and Ranma Greek chorused</p><p>
  Zhu Shu stuck out her tongue at them.</p><p>
  Ami had pulled out her mini comp and was scratching  her head.  Zhu Shu fluttered over.  “What do?”</p><p>
  “Trying to figure out how those small wings can lift  your mass.  The lift to weight ratios are  just not making sense.  By my  calculations, your wings are flapping way too slowly to keep you airborne, but  I’m also showing a field effect in the magical flows around you.”  She tapped the computer screen.  “So you’re flying by magic.  That’s a relief.  I was worried for a second you were violating  the laws of physics.  Magic’s something  else.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu blinked.   “Is good?”</p><p>
  Ami nodded.   “Yes, sensei.  At least for my own  piece of mind.”</p><p>
  Mina laughed.   “Be glad my special effects technician isn’t here, Zhu-chan.  She’d be all over you looking for wires.”</p><p>
  “She doesn’t have any wires” Rei smirked.  “I can verify that.”</p><p>
  Mina gave her a sidelong look, then draped herself  over Rei’s shoulder.  “Oh really?  Do tell?”</p><p>
  Rei just gave her a grin.</p><p>
  Makoto looked between Rei and Zhu Shu, and  smiled.  “Oh, I get it.  You just took our sensei for a test drive.”</p><p>
  “Mako-chan!” Rei sputtered</p><p>
  “What?  You come  in here grinning like a canary that ate a cat, and our sensei is blushing to  her toes.  As smug as you are, you two  had to be up to something.”</p><p>
  “Rei slept with Zhu Shu?”  Usagi blurted out.  Rei kicked her in the shin.</p><p>
  “What business is it of yours?” she asked overly  sweetly.</p><p>
  Usagi rubbed her leg.   “Ow!  I was just surprised you  were a pervert.”</p><p>
  Rei started to glow with a battle aura, but Makoto  held up her hand.  Rei paused, still  glowing, but let her continue.</p><p>
  “Usagi?  Let me  ask you this.  Our sensei likes girls,  our assistant sensei is engaged to a girl, as well as a boy who turns into a  girl, and it’s only Rei you ask if she’s a pervert because we suspect she might  have been out playing with our sensei?” Makoto shook her head.  “Sometimes I just can’t figure you out,  princess.”</p><p>
  Usagi looked at the hard stares from Rei and Akane and  blushed.  “Okay, okay, I’m sorry.  I was surprised.  After the fight I had with her for Mamoru, I  thought Rei liked boys.”</p><p>
  Rei lost her glow, but still looked miffed.  “I do.   I also like Zhu Shu.  And she’s  certainly treated me nicer than any guy I’ve dated. Even nicer than Mamoru did,  though he’s a close call.  Now, if I  choose to date Zhu Shu for a while, what’s wrong with that?”</p><p>
  Realizing the danger, Usagi held up her hands in  submission.  “Nothing, okay.  I’m sorry Rei.  It just seems everybody else suspected except  me.”</p><p>
  “We can’t help it if you’re not very observant.”  Mina chimed in.  “Hell, if Rei hadn’t already claimed her, I  might have been tempted to chase our sensei.   I’ve had my share of girls chasing me, but Zhu-chan is special.”  She gave Rei a cocky grin.  “I’m almost jealous.”</p><p>
  Usagi blinked.   “Okay, then I guess I don’t feel so weird.”</p><p>
  “Of course, the question still remains.  <em>Did</em> you go off to play with Zhu-chan?”  Mina  asked Rei.</p><p>
  Rei sniffed.   “Like I’d tell.  That’s <em>my</em> business.”</p><p>
  “Oh come on, you can trust us.”  Mina prodded.   Rei gave her a warning glare, and Mina held up her hands, “Okay, okay.”</p><p>
  Usagi suddenly smiled.   “Hey!  That means you <em>were</em> on a date that night!”  </p><p>
  Rei rolled her eyes.   “So? You go on dates all the time.”</p><p>
  “Yeah,” Makoto added.   “You even skipped school today to go out with...” dramatic pause  followed by a mock dreamy sigh of “<em>Mamoru!</em>”</p><p>
  Usagi nodded, “Yeah, but she paddled me!” she  protested, then blinked. “Hey, that reminds me.   I had something weird happen today.   Some little girl showed up and demanded the Silver Crystal!  She had a toy gun, well I didn’t know it was  a toy gun at the time, but she knocked me down and wanted the Crystal.”   Usagi shook her head.  “And she  had pink hair pulled into odango like mine.   And she seemed to know that I had the Crystal.”</p><p>
  “So what did you do with her?”  Mina asked.</p><p>
  “She disappeared.   Mamoru and I looked around the park, but we couldn’t find her.”</p><p>
  “Humph.  Sounds  like you were talking too loud and the kid was playing cops and robbers.”  Rei sniffed.</p><p>
  “Not know Rei.   Should not dismiss until checked.”   Zhu Shu said.</p><p>
  “Alright.  If  you see this girl again, let us know.”   Rei said, only marginally gracefully.</p><p>
  Ami meanwhile had been scanning Zhu Shu, and finally  lowered her mini comp.  “Okay, I’ve got  complete readings.  I’ll see if I can  make heads or tails of them.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “Is really okay, Zhu Shu not mind be dragon girl.  Like be able to fly.”</p><p>
  Ami smiled.  “Of  course, but I just want to make sure you’re stable, and not going to change any  further.  Magic is… unpredictable at  times.  The scientist in me just wants to  be sure you’re okay.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   She turned and asked Akane how the class had gone, and let her give the  end of class pointers, then apologized to the girls for having been absent,  blushing furiously when Makoto assured her that making out with Rei was much  more important.  Rei sighed, but didn’t  say anything.  As the girls left, Zhu  Shu’s sharp ears caught Makoto complimenting Rei on her good taste.  She smiled.   At least none of the girls were doing more than friendly hazing.  </p><p>
  That was definitely reassuring.  Despite the fact that female to female  relationships seemed far more acceptable here in Japan, she had been worried Rei  would have trouble with her friends over their relationship.</p><p>
  She turned to Akane and Ranma.  “Zhu Shu thanks Akane for teaching.”</p><p>
  Akane gave her a mischievous grin.  “I’m glad to see she took my suggestion to  ‘cheer you up’ so literally.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu smiled.   “Will admit, did make feel better.   Told Rei about Ukyo.  Seem Usagi  is how Ukyo find Ranma.”</p><p>
  Ranma raised an eyebrow.  “Why doesn’t that surprise me.  What’d the ditz do?”</p><p>
  “Mention name when at Ukyo’s restaurant.  Name Uc-chan’s.”</p><p>
  “She named a restaurant after my nick name for  her?  I thought she hated that name now.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head.  “No.   When Zhu Shu look inside her, see Ranma be all she think about for  years.”</p><p>
  Ranma shook his head.   “That’s the part I don’t get.  Why  didn’t she just go on with her life?  Why  be so focused on something that occurred when we were children?”</p><p>
  Akane shook her head.   “I don’t know.  I think I remember  her saying something about having to be a boy because of you.”</p><p>
  “That makes no sense.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu cocked her head, then motioned for Ranma and  Akane to wait.  She blurred and there was  a sound of a crash from outside, along with a startled yelp, then Ukyo’s  spatula fell to the ground in front of the dojo.  The girl herself was brought in a few seconds  later, casually wrapped up in Zhu Shu’s ribbons.  The dragon girl set her down and did her best  to ignore the other girl’s glare.</p><p>
  Ranma sighed.   “So how long you been out there?”</p><p>
  Ukyo turned her glare on him.  “Long enough to hear how utterly clueless you  are.”</p><p>
  “Care to clue me in then?  I really don’t want to fight you  Uc-chan.  It don’t matter how good you  are, you can’t beat me.  I’m <em>almost</em> as fast at Zhu Shu here, and you  just got shown how fast that is.  Just  tell me why you’re so upset.”</p><p>
  Ukyo’s eyes narrowed.   “Because you ruined my life, you ass!   You left me behind!”</p><p>
  “I didn’t know anything about an engagement!  I was only six!”</p><p>
  “That doesn’t matter!   You left me, and because you left me, you stole my femininity!  I haven’t been able to <em>BE</em> a woman since you ran out on me!”</p><p>
  Akane and Zhu Shu looked at each other and blinked in  confusion.  Ranma scratched his head as  well.  “I don’t get that Uc-chan.  You’re still a girl, right?  You didn’t get hit with a curse that changes  you into a boy or something did you?”</p><p>
  “What kind of idiotic question is that?”</p><p>
  Ranma sighed and looked over at Akane, who promptly  got the bucket again and dumped it over Ranma.</p><p>
  Ukyo stared in disbelief.  Then Akane poured it on her own head, her  pink bunny ears popping up.  Ukyo turned  her eyes on Zhu Shu, who produced a kettle and changed back to her normal form.</p><p>
  Ukyo blinked.</p><p>
  And blinked again.</p><p>
  “OOOOOkaaaay,” she finally said.  “I take it then that you all have that  curse.  And no, I don’t have a  curse.  Yes, I am female in body, I just  can’t be one.”</p><p>
  Ranma crouched down to be at eye level with the bound  girl.  “That’s what I don’t  understand.  Why?”</p><p>
  “Because I can’t, okay!  Because my dad refuses to acknowledge he has  a daughter!  Once you ran off he swore I  would never be a daughter in his eyes again!   I either have to marry you or spend the rest of my life legally male!”</p><p>
  Ranma blinked.   “But… but… that’s idiotic!”</p><p>
  “You’re telling me!?!   I’ve had to live this way for ten years because of you!”</p><p>
  Ranma sighed.   “Look, Ukyo, I’m sorry about that, but I never knew you were female, and  I never knew about the engagement.  Dad  is being raked over the coals right now by my mother, and I can guarantee  gramps sure as hell won’t agree to another betrothal.  If it hadn’t been such an advantage to him,  the betrothal to Shan Pu wouldn’t have happened.  I can’t marry you, I’m sorry.  I hope we can be friends again, but I don’t  know what else to tell you.”</p><p>
  Ukyo glared, but only for a few more minutes before  she finally deflated and sighed.  “You <em>have</em> to.”</p><p>
  “I can’t.  I’m  sorry Ukyo, but I love Akane, and I have to marry her and Shan Pu.”</p><p>
  Akane smiled.   “Nice of you to finally admit that.   Now maybe you could say it to me every so often?”</p><p>
  Ranma blushed. “Umm…”</p><p>
  Akane laughed.   “Just kidding, Ranma-chan.”</p><p>
  Ranma sighed.   “Anyway, you’re a really cute girl.   You shouldn’t let my pop’s idiocy continue to mess up your life.”</p><p>
  Ukyo smiled sadly.   “It’s nice of you to say that, but you just don’t understand.  You’re the only man I <em>can</em> marry.  If I don’t marry <em>you</em> by the time I turn eighteen, My dad  will <em>arrange</em> a marriage… for his <em>son</em>.   I’ll get foisted off on some silly girl.   It’s even in his will.  Legally, I <em>am</em> his son now, and I can only inherit  if I’m married.  You’re my one escape  clause.”</p><p>
  Ranma blinked.   “That’s just…”  Words failed him.</p><p>
  “Idiotic?   Supremely stupid?”  Akane chimed  in.  “Like arranging a marriage between  two infants, or marriage by conquest?”</p><p>
  Ranma sighed.   “Okay, okay, but I’m still not sure what can be done.”</p><p>
  “Nothing, son.”   Nodoka said as she entered.   “Genma had no authority to make the engagement.”</p><p>
  Ranma sighed.   “Hi mom.  Have you been listening  too?”</p><p>
  “No, I just came out here after your father finished  pleading for his life, and I had called my father.  Is this the girl in question?”</p><p>
  “Yeah.  Mom,  this is Ukyo.  Ukyo, my mom.”</p><p>
  Ukyo attempted to bow.   Zhu Shu twisted her wrist and the ribbons unwrapped as she replaced her  swords behind her back.  Ukyo shook  herself and stood to bow.  “Hello, Mrs.  Saotome.”</p><p>
  Nodoka bowed back.   “Greetings.  I fear I must  apologize for my husband, but he had no authority to make any arrangements  regarding my son’s marriage.  The terms  of our prenuptial expressly exclude that right.   I felt father was a trifle paranoid in  thinking Genma would try to ‘pawn my son off for a loaf of bread’ as he put it,  but in retrospect, I see his wisdom.  My  father was behind the approval of the Saotome Tendo marriage, and he approved  the marriage alliance with the Joketsuzoku.   He does not, and will not approve the deal Genma made with your  father.  I’m sorry child, but your claim  has no legal standing.”</p><p>
  Ukyo’s shoulders slumped in defeat.  “I… I…   “</p><p>
  Nodoka’s eyes were full of sympathy, but it was  obvious the decision was final.  Ukyo’  eyes closed as she let it sink in, and finally, she turned and fled the  dojo.  Ranma started after her, but  Nodoka held the red-head back.  “I know  it’s not your fault son, but I think you’ve caused her enough pain for right now.”</p><p>
  Ranma sighed.   “Yeah, I guess you’re right, mom.   I just hate this kinda stuff.  She  used to be my best friend.”</p><p>
  Akane hugged her from behind.  “And you wonder why I love you.  You may be an idiot in a lot of ways, but you  really care about what counts.”  She  kissed Ranma on the ear.  “Come on, let’s  go get some dinner.  I just heard Kasumi  calling.”</p><p>
  Ranma shook her head.   “I can’t believe how sensitive your rabbit ears are.”</p><p>
  Nodoka smiled.   “Yes indeed.  Among other  things.  Though it may be a while before  your father gets to enjoy any of that again.”</p><p>
  “Mom!  I don’t  need to know stuff like that!”</p><p>
  Nodoka laughed at the blush her comment elicited.  Akane smiled and turned to ask if Zhu Shu was  coming.</p><p>
  But the Chinese girl was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>It had all gone wrong.</p><p>
  It wasn’t supposed to happen this way!</p><p>
  It was supposed to end with a beaten and bruised Ranma  begging her forgiveness for having caused her such pain, begging to be allowed  to make up for hurting her.  Begging to  be allowed to carry out the vow he had run out on so long ago…</p><p>
  But that hadn’t happened.</p><p>
  Instead, he had rebuffed her.  She’d been unable to even come close to  hitting him, and he’d escaped her revenge almost casually!  Then, even when she’d broken down and told  him the whole mad story, he’d still refused her!  Clinging to that other girl, with her  ridiculous bobbed hair and that long braid!   What did she think she was, an American surfer?</p><p>
  She sat on the concrete slope under the bridge where  she’d found refuge and cried for the first time since she had turned  twelve.  It wasn’t supposed to be this  way! </p><p>
  “Is very hard to have dreams die, yes no?”</p><p>
  Ukyo nodded.  </p><p>
  “Makes one wish die.”</p><p>
  Ukyo nodded again, unable to stop crying.</p><p>
  “When dreams die, seem like whole world end.   But world goes on.”</p><p>
  “How can it?’</p><p>
  “Because life does.   And in life, sometimes are second chances.”</p><p>
  “You heard him, and his mother!  There is no chance!”</p><p>
  “Not with Ranma.   In time, perhaps someone else.”</p><p>
  Ukyo buried her face in her arms.  “What do you know anyway?”</p><p>
  “Much.  When  young, lose first love.  Feel like whole  world lose all color.  Go through life  like it a dream, thinking only of loss and pain.  Hurt so bad think only want to join with lost  love; that life hurt too much without.   Try kill self.  That four years  ago.”</p><p>
  Ukyo finally looked up into Zhu Shu’s jade green  eyes.  “You can’t be that much older than  I am.”</p><p>
  “Seventeen.   Lose Ying-Ying when only thirteen.   Take Zhu Shu four years finally learn life go on.  That death of one dream not mean new dream can  never come.”</p><p>
  “How can it?   Everything is against me!  If he  won’t marry me, I’m stuck playing at being a man for the rest of my life!”</p><p>
  “So?  Zhu Shu  only be in Japan  for few months, but see males have better freedom and privileges.  Is better than China, but still true.”</p><p>
  “But if I’m stuck being male…”  Ukyo shook her head.  “I know you heard me before.  I don’t want to have an arranged marriage to  a girl!”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu looked down.   “Is because is arranged?  Or  because is to girl?”</p><p>
  “<em>BOTH!</em>  I’m sick and tired of being forced to do  things because of my father!”</p><p>
  “Ranma’s father force train all life.  Force move all life.  Force leave Ukyo.  Ranma forced whole life too.  Only recently he find he can choose.”</p><p>
  “And he chooses the butch chick and the psychotic.”</p><p>
  “Shan Pu is Sister.   Akane is best friend.  Neither one  is bad person.”</p><p>
  “Then why are you here?  Why aren’t you threatening me, or pitying me  like they do?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu looked back at her.  “Because of what see when Ukyo first look  into eyes.”</p><p>
  Ukyo looked away.   “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu sighed, giving Ukyo a pained look.  Finally, she nodded sadly.  “Very well.   Because Zhu Shu have lived through pain, and not want see Ukyo hurt like  Zhu Shu hurt for so long.”</p><p>
  Ukyo shrugged.   “It doesn’t matter.”</p><p>
  “It does to Zhu Shu.”</p><p>
  Ukyo stared into the water.  “And I suppose if I asked you why, I’d just  get some strange answer I don’t want.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu was silent.</p><p>
  Ukyo lowered her head onto her arms, eyes never  leaving the water.  “And why do I feel  like I’ve known you all my life?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu tilted her head, but still said nothing.</p><p>
  Ukyo sighed.   “Do you know I haven’t been able to get you out of my head since I saw  you at the fight.  There was just  something about your eyes, and the way they caught the light and looked like  pure gold.  It was like you could see  right through me, like you knew every thought, every memory, every secret.  You terrify me, and yet, you feel like  somehow, you’re part of me.  I don’t even  know you, and that scares me.”</p><p>
  “And so, Ukyo turn away.”</p><p>
  “Yes.  You scare  me like no-one ever has in my entire life, and yet…”  Ukyo sighed.   “Gods, You confuse the hell out of me!   It’s like you’re inside my mind, just standing there, waiting.  And I don’t know what for!”</p><p>
  Still, Zhu Shu said nothing.</p><p>
  “How can you do this to me?  Why do I feel so scared?”</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu not know.   Only meant to comfort.”</p><p>
  Ukyo buried her face in her arms again.  “Please, just go.”</p><p>
  There wasn’t even a whisper of wind, but still, she  could feel that Zhu Shu had gone.</p><p>
  And somehow… that scared her even more.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Urd paused the image on the screen and stared at the  tattoo.  </p><p>
  “I’ve never seen this.   You say it’s on her back?”</p><p>
  Mara nodded.   “It seems to fade in and out.    And it’s far more disturbing in person.   You can feel Legend’s eyes on you through it.”</p><p>
  “It’s certainly intricate.”</p><p>
  “Yes.  But  there’s more.”  Mara handed Urd another  tape.  “It’s a pity my camera imp won’t  come near me anymore.  Being a goddess  has its drawbacks when you used to be a demon, and most of your servants are  demonic in origin.”</p><p>
  Urd smiled.   “Yeah, at least we got the tapes before it ate them.”</p><p>
  “And most of my notes.”  </p><p>
  Urd popped the tape in and watched a recording of Zhu  Shu, Akane and Rei.  They were riding in  a subway, with a couple of bags, talking to keep the boredom away.</p><p>
  “The kicker is a few minutes in.”  Mara took the remote and fast forwarded.  “Here.”</p><p>
  Urd listened as Zhu Shu told Rei and Akane about a  dream she’d had the day she got killed, about how her former love, Ying-Ying  had come to her, and explained the meanings of the four items the Dragon held  in it’s claws.  When it was done, Urd sat  back and whistled.</p><p>
  “Okay.  So on  top of everything else, I have to match Zhu Shu up with specific people?”  Urd rubbed her temple.  “What I wouldn’t give for a guide book here,  so I can keep all the players straight!”</p><p>
  Mara gave her an amused look.  “No, what you need is a list of what all your  other self prearranged.  Of all the  stories I’ve heard of the Dragon, I’ve never heard of one where he’s foretold  the future.”</p><p>
  “No.  Even  Kami-sama says the future is not set.   Broad possibilities can be mapped out, but until the Absolute Now  crystallizes the present, no one can know the absolute future.  And even the past can be changed if one is  willing to alter the time stream that lies between the past and the Absolute  Now.  The trouble is that doing so is  essentially playing dice with the universe.   The effect may be minor, or catastrophic.  I mean, the only reason I would do it is to…”  Urd trailed off.</p><p>
  “What?”</p><p>
  “Well… when the Terrible Master cut the superstring, I  was panicked, but it occurred to me later, that had the universe actually  started ending, as the Norn of the Past, if I could have gotten to the Gate of  Time and convinced Pluto of the need, I could have gone back and made sure  that it had never happened.  I could have kept you from awakening the  Terrible Master.”</p><p>
  Mara colored in shame.   “I’m sorry I did Urd.  I certainly  never expected him to possess you.”</p><p>
  Urd waved her off.   “My point is that only something that threatened reality itself would  have convinced Pluto to let me go back in time.    She’s only rarely allowed anyone to go  through for any reason, let alone a goddess.   And to have allowed ME, the goddess who monitors the past, to have gone  through, it would take a reality threatening event.  And it would take both of our efforts  together to actually change the past.”</p><p>
  “A reality threatening event?”</p><p>
  “Yeah.  Like the  end of the Universe itself.  And  considering how much emphasis my older self put on not letting Chaos get a hold  of Zhu Shu, I wonder if somehow it’s like the start of a string of events that  leads to the destruction of everything.”   Urd sighed.  “The deeper into this  mess I get, the more frustrating it gets, and the more worried I get.  I’m starting to think that somehow I’m  dealing with a reality nexus here.”</p><p>
  Mara raised her eyebrow.  “I thought reality nexii were just a story.”</p><p>
  “So did I.”</p><p>
  “So, suppose that reality nexii are real, suppose that  somehow, our entire reality is dependant on one person, or group… how would we  know, and how would we deal with it?”</p><p>
  Urd held her hands in her face.  “That’s just it, Mara.  I don’t know.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Dinner at the Tendo’s was a little quieter than usual,  the war between Ranma and Genma for food tempered by Nodoka’s stern looks  whenever Genma got too enthusiastic.  Mid  way through, China  announced her presence by leaping into Akane’s lap and demanding small slivers  of Akane’s fish.  Ranma was too  distracted to notice, still going over the situation with Ukyo in his  mind.  And worrying about Zhu Shu’s  absence. </p><p>
  After dinner, while Akane was finishing her homework,  Ranma wondered up to the roof, looking for a quiet place to think about the  day, and found Zhu Shu already sitting up there, staring sadly off into the  distance.  He sat down next to her and  waited, finally asking “Do you want to talk?”</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu not know.”   was the faint answer.</p><p>
  “Where’d you go?”</p><p>
  “See Ukyo.”</p><p>
  Ranma nodded.  A  few minutes passed as the silence grew oppressive.</p><p>
  “She hates me, doesn’t she?”</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu not know.”</p><p>
  More time passed as crickets began to chirrup in the  garden.  The air grew cooler as the last  traces of sunset faded.</p><p>
  “Did you talk?”</p><p>
  “Yes.”</p><p>
  “About me?”</p><p>
  “Some.”</p><p>
  “About you?”</p><p>
  “Yes.”  </p><p>
  Ranma closed his eyes at the barely suppressed sob.</p><p>
  “What did she say?”</p><p>
  “Ask Zhu Shu to go.   Say Zhu Shu terrify her.”</p><p>
  Ranma put his arm around her and held her to his  shoulder, doing his best to comfort her through the tears…</p>
