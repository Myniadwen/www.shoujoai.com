<h1>Abandoned No More (part 3 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/fherriot.html">Fred Herriot</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/abanomo-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>IN THE SECOND PART OF &quot;RANKO, ABANDONED NO MORE,&quot; the Saotomes
learn that Cologne&#39;s clan is descent from the first babies reborn
from Nini-Quan-Qi-Niang in Confucius&#39; time.  Ranko, feeling sad
that she had to shatter Shampoo&#39;s dream, tries to convince the
warrior-maiden to give Mousse another chance.  Later at Ucchan&#39;s,
after confronting Ranko in concern to Ranma and Akane, Kodachi
reveals that she now knows of Jusenkyou and its effects from
Tsubasa.  Believing Ranko to be a spirit possessing Ranma when he
becomes a girl, Kodachi confronts the newest member of the
Saotome clan.  By then, Ranma and Akane have left for China,
determined to find a cure to Jusenkyou&#39;s curse.  Kodachi realizes
Ranko is not Ranma, then helps her suppress a drunken Ukyou and
Shampoo.  Later, Ranko has a dream of Akane, Ukyou, Shampoo and
Kodachi desiring her...which leads to an interesting complication
with Kodachi, who elected to remain with the lost child that
evening.

**** **** ****

Thus saying that...ON WITH THE SHOW!!!!

**** **** ****

     &quot;Eh?!!&quot; Ukyou gasps.  &quot;You&#39;re kidding me?!!&quot;

     &quot;Ai-yah!!!&quot; Shampoo exclaims.  &quot;Ranko...seduce Kodachi?!&quot;

     Both stare at Kodachi, who calmly sips her tea.  &quot;Well, we
seduced each other, Shampoo,&quot; the rhythmic gymnast muses
non-chalantly.

     &quot;Shampoo no know Kodachi lesbian,&quot; the warrior-maiden muses.

     &quot;Relax, I&#39;m not,&quot; Kodachi laughs.  &quot;Come now, Shampoo.
Surely in a matriarchial clan like yours, there are those women
who prefer other women as potential mates over men.&quot;

     Shampoo nods in confirmation.  &quot;You mean that&#39;s tolerated?!&quot;
Ukyou blinks in disbelief.

     &quot;Of course,&quot; Shampoo nods.  &quot;If person born bisexual,
lesbian or gay, that is way gods want them to be.  No teaching
can change that.  No need to force them to be heterosexual; all
that cause is great pain.  Shampoo know many people like that;
many good friends with Shampoo.&quot;

     &quot;Wow!&quot; Ukyou whistles in awe.  &quot;That&#39;s incredible.  You&#39;d
never hear things like that here in Japan.&quot;

     &quot;Nor in the rest of China, I suspect,&quot; Kodachi sighs.

     &quot;So how did this happen to you?&quot; Ukyou gazes at the rhythmic
gymnast.  &quot;You never struck me as a voyeur.&quot;

     &quot;I&#39;m not, admittedly...although I do admit to several times
when I&#39;ve shared intimate moments with several classmates,&quot;
Kodachi hums.  &quot;Some could say that goes with the territory in a
same-sex school; I can&#39;t be too sure.  However, that did not
prepare me for last night.&quot;

     &quot;Ranko did seduce you!&quot; Ukyou tenses.

     &quot;No,&quot; Kodachi repeats.  &quot;You don&#39;t understand the temptation
that girl could present.  Where it counts the most, Ranko-chan is
Ranma-kun...totally free of any ties to Akane Tendou.&quot;

     Hearing that, Shampoo and Ukyou tense, imagining what it
would be like to have their dream lover free of Akane&#39;s grasp.
&quot;We&#39;re all used to Ran-chan being a girl whenever he gets
splashed with cold water,&quot; Ukyou breathes in.  &quot;Oh, man.&quot;

     &quot;Is temptation Shampoo no think she can resist,&quot; Shampoo
admits.

     &quot;Exactly,&quot; Kodachi nods.  &quot;Now, I suspect all three of
us...while our curiosity could, and in my case has, lead us to a
liaison with another woman ...would prefer to have a man as a
future life-partner.  With Ranma-kun now tied to Akane, that
leaves me with Tsubasa-kun,&quot; she glances at Shampoo, &quot;...you with
Mousse-san,&quot; then glances at Ukyou, &quot;...and you with Konatsu-san.
Now...where does that leave Ranko-chan?&quot;

     Shampoo and Ukyou exchange looks.  &quot;Alone,&quot; the latter
concludes.

     &quot;Ai-yah!&quot; the former gasps.  &quot;That no good!&quot;

     &quot;Why do you say that?!&quot;

     &quot;Ukyou no understand,&quot; Shampoo looks down.  &quot;Ranko is spirit
of unwanted daughter.  Ranko dream of having family which no
reject her.  If Ranko feel rejection, Shampoo no want to think of
result.&quot;

     &quot;In essence, Ukyou, Ranko-chan could literally die of
loneliness if she felt she was not loved by anyone,&quot; Kodachi
augments.

     &quot;Oh,&quot; Ukyou pales.  &quot;Kodachi, can you be sure Ranko&#39;s a
lesbian?&quot;

     &quot;Not a hundred percent,&quot; the rhythmic gymnast admits.  &quot;But
Ranko-chan had quite the dream about us last night.  That
confirms that whatever Ranma-kun felt about us, Ranko-chan now
feels she is free to explore.  She&#39;s done it with me; given the
right circumstances, she can do the same with you two, even
Akane.  And if we reject her...&quot;

     &quot;Ranko could die,&quot; Shampoo shudders.  &quot;And if Shampoo, Ukyou
and Kodachi let Ranko die...&quot;

     &quot;Ran-chan would kill us,&quot; Ukyou finishes.  &quot;Oh, shit!&quot;

     Silence falls over Ucchan&#39;s as the three would-be fiancees
consider their options.  &quot;Speaking of which, where is Ran-chan,
now?&quot; Ukyou wonders.

     &quot;Ranko said he and Akane are going to Jusenkyou to find the
cure to his curse...and yours, too,&quot; Kodachi stares at Shampoo.

     &quot;Ai-yah!!&quot; Shampoo gasps.  &quot;Ranma so kind!  Shampoo hope
Ranma succeed this time!&quot;

     &quot;I hope so, too,&quot; Ukyou sighs.  &quot;But we&#39;ve got a bigger
problem before us, girls.  What do we do about Ranko?&quot;

     Shampoo hums, then stares at Kodachi.  &quot;Shampoo have idea!&quot;
the warrior- maiden then smiles.  &quot;Shampoo think that Ranko must
first learn if she is lesbian or not.  Only way to prove that is
to get Ranko to date man.&quot;

     &quot;Your brother!!&quot; Ukyou turns to Kodachi.  &quot;He&#39;s always had
the hots for his &#39;pig-tailed goddess!&#39;  Ranko&#39;d be a godsend to
him!&quot;

     &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Kodachi sighs.  &quot;Ranma-kun and my brother
don&#39;t normally get along.  I think Ranko-chan might not go along
with it.&quot;

     &quot;For her sake and ours, we have to try,&quot; Ukyou warns...

                           *    *    *

     &quot;A fair day, is it not, Sasuke?&quot; Tatewaki Kunou sighs as he
gazes at another peaceful day in Nerima, an event in itself given
the chaos which made this district of Tokyo rival its neighbour
Tomobiki for sheer weirdness.  &quot;Indeed, it moves me to
contemplate seeking my Osagi-no-onna or Akane Tendou to see if
they will finally turn away from that cur Saotome!&quot;

     &quot;It is a lovely day, Master Kunou,&quot; Sasuke admits.  &quot;But I
have heard that Master Saotome and Mistress Akane have gone to
China for some curious reason.&quot;

     Kunou tenses.  &quot;And they said nothing to anyone?  This bears
watching, Sasuke!  Learn what you can.&quot;

     &quot;Of course, Master,&quot; the ninja bows, then departs.

     The door slides open, revealing Kodachi.  &quot;Good morning,
brother dear.  How are you today?&quot;

     &quot;My sister,&quot; Kunou stares quizzically as the rhythmic
gymnast sits beside him.  &quot;Where have you been?  You did not come
home last night.&quot;

     &quot;I...was spending time with a friend,&quot; Kodachi admits,
forcing herself to be calm.  Her brother was capable of wild
assumptions on the most minuscule of information.  What was
coming next would require a lot of steel nerves.  Kunou was
capable of much, especially if he felt his sense of reality was
threatened.  Kodachi could not conceive of no threat greater than
what Ranko now had in mind.

     The doorbell rings.  Sasuke then comes in.  &quot;Master Kunou,
you won&#39;t believe who&#39;s here!&quot; the ninja excitedly announces.

     &quot;Who?!&quot; Kunou turns...then jolts.  &quot;You!&quot;

     &quot;Hello, Tatewaki-kun,&quot; Ranko smiles.  &quot;Can I come in?&quot;

     Frozen for just a second, Kunou bolts to his feet and nearly
squashes her with a bear hug.  &quot;My pig-tailed goddess!!!  You
have come at last to express your love, free of all inhibitions
that wretch Saotome has unleashed on you in the past!!!  Now,
now, we shall be as one!!!&quot;

     He pauses, surprised to hear sniffs emenate from Ranko.
Kunou backs away, gazing concernedly at her.  &quot;What has moved you
to tears, my precious?!&quot; he gently grasps her hand.  &quot;Are you so
overwhelmed by my sincerity that you weep for joy?!  Speak, my
love!!&quot;

     &quot;No,&quot; Ranko looks down, privately surprised at her
performance.  Part of her wondered if it actually WAS a
performance.  &quot;Tatewaki-kun, you better sit down.  I&#39;ve...come
here today not to heal hearts...but to break them.  Yours, to be
precise.&quot;

     Kunou pales as he slowly sits.  Ranko relaxes before him.
&quot;It has been a...hectic year since we met behind Furinkan High,&quot;
she admits.  &quot;Strange.  Even to this day, you still don&#39;t know my
name...or the truth of my relationship to Ranma.&quot;

     &quot;What?!  What?!!&quot; he gasps.  &quot;Tell me, my princess!!  I wait
with baited breath!!!&quot;

     &quot;My name is Ranko Saotome,&quot; Ranko announces.  &quot;Ranma is my
older brother.&quot;

     If Kunou had been hit by an atomic bomb, he would not have
sensed it, the shock Ranko&#39;s words produce is that great.
&quot;What...?&quot; he gasps.  &quot;You... and Saotome...you&#39;re brother and
sister?!&quot;

     &quot;Yes,&quot; Ranko nods.  &quot;Surely by now, you noticed the
similarity in our fighting styles.&quot;

     Kunou considers the point.  &quot;I have.&quot;

     &quot;Well,&quot; Ranko sighs, grateful that the kendoist was not as
swift in analytical deduction as he was in martial arts, &quot;...as I
said before, it has been a very hectic year for me.  Most of all,
discovering who and what I am.  Your...attraction to me
has...admittedly not helped.  What I&#39;m about to tell you will
come as a shock.&quot;

     &quot;Tell me,&quot; he urges.

     Ranko takes in a deep breath.  &quot;Tatewaki-kun...I&#39;m a
lesbian.&quot;

     Silence.  More silence.  For two minutes, Kunou remains
frozen, staring wide-eyed at Ranko.  &quot;Tatewaki-kun...?&quot; the lost
girl waves a hand across his face.  &quot;Are you okay?!&quot;

     &quot;Brother, dear, did you hear her?&quot; Kodachi gently prods him.

     Finally, Kunou leans up to her.  &quot;You...lesbian?&quot; he
hoarsely gasps, then a volcano explodes behind him!!  &quot;WHAT
SORCERY IS THIS?!?!?!  What has that cur Saotome done to
you...?!!&quot;

     &quot;Oh, Tatewaki-kun, stop, please!&quot; Ranko sighs.  &quot;No sorcery
is involved in making me this way!  You don&#39;t decide one day that
you&#39;re a lesbian!  You&#39;re BORN a lesbian!  I can&#39;t change the way
I am just like you can&#39;t change the way you are!!&quot;

     Kunou trembles, tears brimming his eyelids as he gazes
intently on the woman he has lusted after for so long.  &quot;When did
you learn this?!&quot;

     &quot;Some time ago,&quot; Ranko sighs.  &quot;For a while there, I admit I
was interested in your attention.  Then...recently, I began to
discover that men ...didn&#39;t interest me as women did.  I found
myself attracted to the women Onii-chan cared for.  Ukyou,
Shampoo, your own sister, even Akane-onee-chan!  When Onii-chan
decided he wanted to love and eventually marry Akane-onee-chan, I
actually believed I could move in and take his place with the
others!  Kodachi-chan stayed with me last night.  It took almost
all of my willpower just to prevent me from seducing her!&quot;

     Kunou takes time to absorb that.  &quot;I see,&quot; he looks down.

     &quot;Even more, given the closeness between her and Ranma-kun, I
found myself tempted by Ranko-chan&#39;s advances,&quot; Kodachi admits.
&quot;Brother, dear, think!&quot; she then places a hand on his shoulder.
&quot;It took Ranko-chan a lot to admit that to you.  Admitting what
she is isn&#39;t the healthiest thing to do these days.  Don&#39;t hurt
her by not...&quot;

     &quot;Peace, sweet sister,&quot; Kunou smiles, then gently grasps
Ranko&#39;s hand.  &quot;Ranko-san, your words drive me to tears,
concerned as I am for your good health and fortune.  The fateful
discovery you made about yourself could bring forth a tragedy
which would make the gods howl with grief!  Be assured, my love
for you will not die, thought I know very well you do this to
free me, allow me to seek another.  But another will not be you,
Ranko-san.  You will forever haunt me.&quot;

     &quot;I know,&quot; Ranko smiles.  &quot;I ask one thing.&quot;

     &quot;Ask.&quot;

     &quot;Please...let your thoughts be kind ones,&quot; Ranko kisses his
cheek.  &quot;For I will have great need of them.&quot;

     &quot;They shall,&quot; Kunou vows.  &quot;Oh, believe me, Ranko-san, they
shall!  With the gods as my witness, I will never think ill of
you until the day I die...!!&quot;

     His passion running out of control, his wooden sword then
sweeps up to knock a ceiling panel fitted with an overhead light
out of place.  It comes down *hard* on his head, nearly driving
him through the floorboards!  &quot;Tatewaki-kun, are you okay?!&quot;
Ranko wonders.

     &quot;Until I die...&quot; Kunou groans...

                           *    *    *

     &quot;Well, how was I?!&quot; Ranko breathes out.

     She and Kodachi relax in the Saotomes&#39; apartment with Ukyou
and Shampoo having tea.  &quot;It was magnificent,&quot; Kodachi smiles.
&quot;I must confess, I&#39;ve never seen such realism.  It was almost as
if...you were saying good-bye to my brother.&quot;

     &quot;Given how confused I&#39;ve been at times, maybe I was,&quot; Ranko
sighs.  &quot;The others who&#39;ve fallen into Jusenkyou&#39;re lucky, I
think.  Changing genders every time you get wet doesn&#39;t do one&#39;s
sense of self any good.&quot;

     &quot;I&#39;ll bet,&quot; Ukyou sighs.  &quot;So, you finally got Kunou to lay
off.  I guess Nabiki&#39;ll have to watch out from now on.  With
Ran-chan and Akane intent on tying the knot, it doesn&#39;t give your
brother many options, Kodachi.&quot;

     &quot;No, it doesn&#39;t,&quot; Kodachi sighs.  &quot;But the very thought of
that money- stealing witch marrying my brother doesn&#39;t do wonders
for my stomach.&quot;

     &quot;Hey, give Nabiki a break, huh?&quot; Ranko cuts in.  &quot;Finding
ways of getting money is her way of expressing love.  She&#39;s the
one who pays for all the repairs this place needs every time
someone goes ballistic.&quot;

     &quot;I learned that recently, too,&quot; Kodachi giggles.  &quot;Well, if
Nabiki does choose my brother, I hope she remembers that her
first duty will be to the family she forms with him, not the
family she leaves here.&quot;

     &quot;Well, she&#39;s working on forming her own company,&quot; Ranko
smiles.  &quot;Nabiki Tendou Enterprises.  She&#39;s been bragging about
it for some time, since she met that Kashaoo character, I think.
Given the way she makes money, I&#39;ll bet she&#39;ll be a millionaire
before she hits twenty.&quot;

     &quot;Ranko more forgiving than Ranma,&quot; Shampoo muses.  &quot;Shampoo
know of many times Nabiki bribe Ranma.  Remember Christmas when
Nabiki get us to pay money to spend time alone with Ranma on
roof?&quot;

     &quot;Heavens, I remember!&quot; Kodachi groans.  &quot;It&#39;s a wonder we
didn&#39;t destroy the place after Ranma-kun bolted!&quot;

     &quot;It&#39;s a good thing we didn&#39;t,&quot; Ranko smiles.  &quot;Kasumi went
to a lot of trouble setting that party up.&quot;

     &quot;True,&quot; Ukyou sighs, leaning into Ranko&#39;s side.  &quot;I don&#39;t
know about you two, but I&#39;m going to miss all the fun we&#39;ve had.&quot;

     Ranko blinks, then slips an arm around the okonomiyaki cook.
&quot;So will I,&quot; she gently whispers into Ukyou&#39;s ear.

     They stare at each other.  To Ukyou, the person before her
IS the man she had sought for so long.  &quot;Ran-chan...&quot; she gasps,
then plunges into a very passionate kiss.

     Kodachi remains silent as they allow their feelings to flow
forth.  Shampoo shudders.  &quot;Ai-yah!  Ukyou no play fair!  Shampoo
want to kiss!&quot;

     Ranko turns, draws the warrior-maiden in with her other arm,
then takes a passionate taste of Shampoo&#39;s lips.  &quot;Hey, don&#39;t
hog!&quot; Ukyou wraps her arms around Ranko to draw her away from
Shampoo.

     Ukyou&#39;s hands then land on Ranko&#39;s breasts, giving them a
firm squeeze.  The okonomiyaki cook freezes as Ranko gazes at
her.  Shampoo stops, staring at the two plump mounds barely
contained by Ranko&#39;s red shirt.  Silence falls as Ukyou and
Shampoo wonder what exactly they were doing.  Ranko then rises,
placing herself in the triangle between her brother&#39;s would-be
fiancees.  She then slides her shirt off.  Next come her pants
and shorts, revealing all her assets for Ukyou and Shampoo.  With
that, Ranko gazes at them.  &quot;If you want to do this, I won&#39;t stop
either of you,&quot; she smiles.  &quot;But now, I know I can face myself
in the morning with little regret.  Can you?&quot;

     Shampoo and Ukyou exchange looks, then rise, determination
shining in their eyes.  &quot;I&#39;ve loved you for a long time,&quot; the
latter sighs.  &quot;If this is the only chance I get, I won&#39;t waste
it.&quot;

     &quot;Shampoo no care if Ranko now girl,&quot; the former smiles.
&quot;Shampoo know in heart, Ranko is Ranma.  What Shampoo gave to
Ranma, Shampoo can also give to Ranko.&quot;

     Ranko smiles.  &quot;Let&#39;s get wet!&quot;

                           *    *    *

     &quot;Ranko&#39;s doing WHAT with Ukyou and Shampoo?!&quot; Nabiki
exclaims.

     &quot;You heard me,&quot; Kodachi sighs.  They relax in the Tendou
living room.  The rhythmic gymnast made a discreet exit when
matters between Ranko, Ukyou and Shampoo became embarrassingly
intimate.

     &quot;And me without my camera,&quot; Nabiki whistles.  &quot;Your brother
would have a fit if he found out.&quot;

     &quot;He already knows of Ranko&#39;s gender preference,&quot; Kodachi
smiles.  &quot;Ranko- chan made a wonderful confession in our home
prior earlier today.  My brother took it in stride.
I...apologize if we just took away one of your many places of
income.&quot;

     Kodachi&#39;s chilling laughter causes Nabiki to scowl.
Admittedly, selling pictures of Ranma&#39;s girl-form to Kunou had
been lucrative for a long time.  Ranko was probably getting her
brother&#39;s revenge for those times.  &quot;Well, there are other ways
of making money,&quot; Nabiki muses.  &quot;After all, pictures of Ranko
being intimate with Ukyou or Shampoo would be a great bribing
tool...&quot;

     Nabiki jerks as Kodachi&#39;s spike-studded baton nearly slices
her face to ribbons!  &quot;Don&#39;t you DARE, Nabiki Tendou!!&quot; the
younger Kunou scowls, the fire in her eyes causing the middle
Tendou to quake.  &quot;If you continue to abuse Ranma- kun or
Ranko-chan in this manner, I will do EVERYTHING in my power to
ensure you NEVER know a happy life with my brother or anyone
else!!&quot;

     Nabiki falls back, surprised by Kodachi&#39;s act.  &quot;Whoa!&quot; she
steels herself.  &quot;Something tells me you also enjoyed some
personal attention from Ranma&#39;s sister.&quot;

     &quot;I won&#39;t dignify that with an answer,&quot; Kodachi muses.
&quot;Least of all to you.  I&#39;m quite aware of how you&#39;ve kept my poor
brother locked in your scams ever since Ranma-kun first came to
live with you.  I will not allow you to continue to do that to
him.  He may be a love-starved idiot, but he&#39;s still kin...and I
will defend my kin.&quot;

     &quot;Geez, chill out, huh!&quot; Nabiki blinks.  &quot;It was just an
idea.&quot;

     Kodachi hums.  &quot;Do us a favour.  Don&#39;t act on it.&quot;

     At that moment, the door slides open, revealing Shampoo and
Ukyou.  Both look quite refreshed, although concern is clearly
etched on their faces.  &quot;So, did you two have some fun with
Ranko-chan?&quot; Nabiki muses as they relax beside Kodachi.

     &quot;Shampoo no give con girl answer,&quot; the warrior-maiden
scowls.  &quot;What go on between Shampoo and Ranko only concern
Shampoo and Ranko.&quot;

     &quot;Yeah, Nabiki!&quot; the okonomiyaki cook growls.  &quot;Not all of us
want to be targets for you to scam money from!&quot;

     Nabiki sweats on feeling their burning stares.  &quot;Gods, will
you all chill out?!  It&#39;s just a joke!&quot;

     &quot;Why don&#39;t you make love to Ranko-chan and see how much of a
joke it is?!&quot; Ukyou sneers, then buries her head.  &quot;Gods, I can&#39;t
believe I actually allowed myself to do that?!  She may be
Ran-chan&#39;s double, but she&#39;s still a girl!&quot;

     &quot;Worse, you may have given Ranko the wrong impression,&quot;
Nabiki cuts in.  &quot;You may not realize this, but your intimacy
could convince Ranko that is the way you want her to treat you.
What happens if you two decide to go after Konatsu and Mousse?
What&#39;ll happen to Ranko?&quot;

     Shampoo and Ukyou pale.  &quot;Ai-yah!!&quot; the former covers her
face.  &quot;Shampoo think we do really stupid thing!&quot;

     &quot;You got that right!!&quot; the latter shudders, then stands.
&quot;C&#39;mon!&quot;

     &quot;Where?&quot;

     &quot;We&#39;re going to talk to Ranko,&quot; Ukyou urges.  &quot;We&#39;re going
to tell her what happened can&#39;t happen again!&quot;

     &quot;Right!&quot; Shampoo stands.  &quot;You come, Kodachi?&quot;

     &quot;I might as well,&quot; Kodachi stands.  &quot;If you&#39;ll excuse us,
Nabiki.&quot;

     Suddenly, the door flies open, revealing Ranko.  &quot;Guys,
c&#39;mon!!&quot;

     &quot;What is it, Ranko?&quot; Nabiki stands.

     &quot;Akane-onee-chan&#39;s on the phone from China!&quot; Ranko waves
them with her.  &quot;She&#39;s got news about Jusenkyou!!&quot;

                           *    *    *

     &quot;Ai-yah!!!&quot; Shampoo gasps.  &quot;No cure?!!&quot;

     The majority of the cast gather around Ranko in the
Saotomes&#39; living room.  &quot;Are you sure he didn&#39;t fall into
Nyannichuan, Akane-onee-chan?!&quot; she calls into the phone.  A
pause, then, &quot;Oh, it was Nannichuan, huh?  Fell in and he still
turned into a girl?&quot;  Another pause.  &quot;What did the guide say?!&quot;
Silence, then, &quot;You can&#39;t curse yourself twice?  What about some
of the creeps we&#39;ve run into who&#39;ve got hybrid bodies?!&quot;  A
pause.  &quot;Oh...mix the water before dousing someone, huh?  Eh?!&quot;
she blinks.  &quot;Onii-chan heard something?  Well, keep us up to
date, huh!  We&#39;ve got our fingers crossed, Akane-onee-chan!
&#39;Bye!&quot;

     She hangs up.  &quot;Well?!&quot; Mousse gasps.

     Ranko sighs.  &quot;The guide told Onii-chan that after you&#39;ve
become cursed by Jusenkyou, you can&#39;t immerse yourself again and
expect the curse to go away.  You&#39;ve be cursing yourself twice in
effect...and that doesn&#39;t happen, or so the guide said.&quot;

     &quot;You mean after all the time Ranma spent looking for
variations of Nannichuan, they wouldn&#39;t&#39;ve worked?!&quot; Nodoka
blinks.

     &quot;If they were deprived from the original Nannichuan in
Jusenkyou, no,&quot; Ranko shakes her head.  &quot;If they were indigenous,
like the spring on Toma&#39;s island, that&#39;s another story.  But once
Jusenkyou&#39;s got you, there&#39;s no way out through Jusenkyou.  And
things like the Instant Nannichuan are just temporary cures.&quot;

     Everyone sighs.  Genma looks down, shuddering.  Ranko stares
at her father, realizing that after this revelation, he would
conclude that the whole mess was his fault since he had dragged
Ranma into Jusenkyou without considering the consequences.  It
was in part his fault, but now was certainly no time to make
accusations.  &quot;How&#39;s Ran-chan taking it?&quot; Ukyou wonders.

     &quot;Hard,&quot; Ranko sighs.  &quot;But Akane-onee-chan said that
Onii-chan heard some rumours about a possible regimen one could
undergo to work the curse out of your system.  He&#39;s going to
investigate it, then get back to us.&quot;

     &quot;I&#39;ve heard of that,&quot; Cologne muses.  &quot;But they&#39;ve never
been done since there are those powers out there who desire to
possess Jusenkyou&#39;s power for themselves.  I don&#39;t know the
details, but it is said to work if one&#39;s willing to take the
risk.&quot;

     &quot;Poor Ran-chan!&quot; Ukyou sighs.  &quot;Losing that curse was the
biggest dream he had.  Now he may never get it.&quot;

     &quot;All our dreams&#39;ve been taking a beating over the last
while,&quot; Kodachi muses.  &quot;Well, let&#39;s hope for the best.&quot;

     &quot;Agreed,&quot; Mousse stands.

     &quot;I&#39;ll call Akari and get her to pass it on to Ryouga,&quot; Ranko
breathes out.  &quot;He&#39;ll want to know.&quot;

     With that, the crowd disperses.  Kodachi, Ukyou and Shampoo
remain close to Ranko as they head onto the front lawn.  Once
they are alone, the four exchange looks, then the would-be
fiancees face Ranko.  &quot;Ranko-chan, we&#39;ve got a confession to
make,&quot; Ukyou begins.  &quot;I...speaking for myself, I enjoyed what we
did.  But...I don&#39;t think I can do that with you again.&quot;

     &quot;Oh?&quot; Ranko blinks.

     &quot;I believe I&#39;m speaking for all of us, Ranko-chan,&quot; Kodachi
cuts it.  &quot;We enjoyed the experience you gave us.  But...we want
you to know that we&#39;re more inclined...&quot;

     &quot;To be with boys?&quot;

     &quot;Yes,&quot; Shampoo nods.  &quot;Ranko will always be Shampoo&#39;s
friend.  But Shampoo...no can be Ranko&#39;s lover.&quot;

     An embarrassing silence falls as Ranko takes that in.  &quot;Hey,
it&#39;s okay,&quot; she shrugs, forcing a smile.  &quot;I enjoyed myself.  I
know you all have guys out there waiting for you.  I guess I was
acting on that dream I had.  Must&#39;ve been a reflection of what
happened between Onii-chan and all of you.  Don&#39;t worry yourself
over it.  Well...good night.&quot;

     She heads inside.  Ukyou, Kodachi and Shampoo watch her go.
All notice the small trail of tears streaming from Ranko&#39;s
eyes...

                           *    *    *

     &quot;Shampoo do stupidest thing she ever done!&quot; Shampoo sobs,
leaning on the counter at Ucchan&#39;s next morning.  &quot;Why Shampoo no
realize what Ranko might feel if Shampoo give herself to Ranko
only once?!&quot;

     Guilty looks are on Kodachi&#39;s and Ukyou&#39;s faces.  Cologne
sits beside Shampoo.  &quot;There, there, child,&quot; she pats Shampoo&#39;s
shoulder.  &quot;You couldn&#39;t resist the temptation Ranko presented.
Right now, you have to quickly discover how you can repair the
damage you caused.&quot;

     &quot;If Ranko kill herself, Shampoo beg Ranma to kill her!&quot;
Shampoo sniffs, then leans down to cry some more.

     &quot;Cologne&#39;s right,&quot; Ukyou sighs, trying to concentrate on
making an okonomiyaki.  &quot;Ranko-chan gave it to us straight and
honest.  We owe it to her to do the same.&quot;

     &quot;How?&quot; Kodachi wonders.

     &quot;Perhaps you should analyze the problem from where it
started,&quot; Cologne sighs.  &quot;That Ranko still possessed Ranma&#39;s
feelings for you is self-evident.  It speaks a lot about her.
It&#39;s obvious to me that Ranko needs her own companion.&quot;

     &quot;But Shampoo no can give herself to Ranko!&quot; Shampoo cries.

     &quot;I can&#39;t see myself doing that!&quot; Ukyou nods.  &quot;What about
you, Kodachi?  You&#39;ve got more experience at this than we do!&quot;

     &quot;I...with all honesty, I can&#39;t, either,&quot; Kodachi sighs.
&quot;Still, Ranko-chan needs a lover.  Our...closeness to her just
exacerbated the point!&quot;

     &quot;Shampoo wish stupid Happousai no trick Ranma into going to
Nini-Quan-Qi- Niang!&quot; Shampoo spits out.

     &quot;We can&#39;t wish that, especially when it comes to people like
Ranko!&quot; Cologne whacks her great-granddaughter with her cane.
&quot;We can&#39;t change the past.  We have to build on it.&quot;

     &quot;Let&#39;s hope we&#39;re in time,&quot; Ukyou sighs.  &quot;You guys want to
eat?&quot;

     The others politely decline, moving to head home.  Ukyou
shuts off her grill, then relaxes.  &quot;Build on what&#39;s come
before,&quot; she sighs.  &quot;Boy, this is gonna be tough...eh?!&quot;

     An idea comes to her...an idea so ridiculously simple, it
astounds her that she never considered it before.  &quot;Build!&quot; she
gasps.  &quot;Build...a lover Ranko-chan can have for her own!!
Kuonji, you&#39;re a genius!!&quot;

     With that, she moves to close the shop down...

                           *    *    *

     &quot;Build a future for Ranko-chan,&quot; Kodachi hums as she heads
home.  &quot;A pity I&#39;m not Victor von Frankenstein; I could actually
build a lover Ranko-chan could have for herself...&quot;

     She stops, eyes widening as it comes to her.  &quot;Of course!!&quot;
she exclaims, then shudders with delight.  &quot;Oh, I should&#39;ve seen
it sooner!  Ranko-chan&#39;s gonna get a Christmas present she&#39;ll
never forget!!&quot;

     With a maniacal giggle, she races home...

                           *    *    *

     &quot;Build future for Ranko,&quot; Shampoo hums as she follows
Cologne back to the Nekohanten.  &quot;What future Ranko could want if
she no have lover she can share future with, Great-grandma?!&quot;

     Cologne smiles.  &quot;Well, I was thinking of how Ranko herself
came into being...&quot;

     Shampoo&#39;s eyes widen understandingly.  &quot;Great-grandma!!
Could that be permitted?!!&quot;

     &quot;I&#39;m sure given the circumstances, it would be allowed!&quot;

     &quot;Ai-yah!!&quot; Shampoo shudders.  &quot;If Shampoo no can be Ranko&#39;s
lover, Ranko get Shampoo who can be Ranko&#39;s lover!!&quot;

     The two race off to prepare...

                           *    *    *

     &quot;You want to go to Jookoji-shima?!&quot; Ranma blinks.  &quot;Why?!&quot;

     &quot;Well, I was thinking about Ranko-chan,&quot; Akane shrugs.  The
two shared a tent near Jusenkyou Valley, relaxing after
discovering the secret which would adversely affect their lives
for years to come.  &quot;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s unfair that Ranko-chan
doesn&#39;t have a companion of her own?  We can provide all the love
we can, but sooner or later, your parents will pass on and we&#39;ll
want to live our own lives.  So I was thinking that if you can do
it, so can I!  What do you say?!&quot;

     Ranma crosses his arms.  &quot;Well, if Ranko-chan is an exact
double of me, she&#39;ll have my love for you.  It would spare us a
load of trouble in the future.  I just hope Yi-xin, Lee-shin and
Mishin don&#39;t get too peeved about it.&quot;

     &quot;I think they&#39;ll approve!&quot; Akane smiles.  &quot;After all, for
who knows how long, Ranko-chan had all those other spirits with
her in that spring.  She must feel lost right now without all her
friends to be with her.  If one friend could come out of that
place to be with her, all the better!&quot;

     &quot;Oh, okay!&quot; Ranma nods.  &quot;We&#39;ll head there tomorrow.  Let&#39;s
hope things don&#39;t go wrong.  G&#39;night, Akane.&quot;

     &quot;Good night, Ranma,&quot; Akane smiles as Ranma turns in.  Laying
back, her smile turns devilish.  *Good thing Nabiki called and
warned me about Kodachi, Ukyou and Shampoo putting the moves on
Ranko-chan!  There&#39;s no way in hell that I&#39;ll let ANY part of MY
man fall into their hands!!  And if another Akane Tendou&#39;s the
only way to prevent that, so be it!!!*

     Shuddering with glee, Akane turns in...

                           *    *    *

To be concluded...
