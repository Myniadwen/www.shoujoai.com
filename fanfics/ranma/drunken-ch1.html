------------------------------------------------------------------

Ukyo let out a sigh as she took down her sign, bringing the 
business day to an official close. It wasn&#39;t the number of customers 
that was disappointing, business had actually been picking up, but the 
lack of one particular customer. All during the evening rush she&#39;d 
been keeping an eye out for the little red head, but he didn&#39;t show 
up, even after she&#39;d invited him over for some free okonomiyaki at 
school today. It&#39;d been to long since she&#39;d really seen him, what 
with that craziness over in China. Unlike some people she had a 
business to run and couldn&#39;t be taking off on extended leave whenever 
she felt like it. And just when Ranma got back, Soun and that 
miserable excuse for a father tried to force their children together 
using Nanniichuan as a bribe. True, she&#39;d seen Ranma at the 
&#39;wedding&#39;, but that didn&#39;t really count; he&#39;d quickly been knocked out 
from all the explosives that had been flung around.

&quot;Ugh, should&#39;ve sent Konatsu out to do this,&quot; thought Ukyo 
as she defiantly struggled against the howling wind to get back to her 
restaurant, one hand clutching her sign and the other raising her 
giant spatula to ward off the driving rain. A sudden flash of 
lightening lit up the dark street and Ukyo caught a glimpse of 
something small lying in a nearby gutter. Hesitating only a moment, 
Ukyo trudged over. Thunder rolled overhead as Ukyo&#39;s eyes widened in 
surprise at the sight of a familiar and unmoving animal. &quot;What&#39;s that 
stupid gaijin bimbo doing here? It&#39;d serve her right if I left her 
out here...&quot; but Ukyo found herself wedging the cat in between her 
body and the sign carrying arm. Bringing her face up close to check 
for injuries, Ukyo was assailed by the unmistakable stench of alcohol. 

&quot;God, you stink Shampoo! How much did you have to drink?&quot; 
Ukyo&#39;s annoyance quickly changed to worry, then alarm, as she noted 
Shampoo&#39;s unnaturally clammy skin and lack of breath. Just as Ukyo 
concluded that Shampoo was dead, the cat took in a shallow, ragged, 
breath of air. &quot;Jackass! Don&#39;t scare me like that!&quot; yelled Ukyo as 
she dashed toward her restaurant with the comatose cat. She was 
thankful to see Konatsu holding the door as he waited for her. 

&quot;Is something wrong Ukyo-sama?&quot; asked Konatsu as he noticed 
her breakneck speed and worried expression. 

&quot;This stupid gaijin bimbo gave herself alcohol poisoning I 
think,&quot; explained Ukyo as she tossed her sign and giant spatula aside 
and waved an intoxicated cat at a puzzled Konatsu. The cat responded 
by puking on Ukyo. &quot;Shampoo you jackass! I&#39;m trying to help you 
here!&quot; yelled Ukyo as she set the cat on a nearby table and started 
drying her off with napkins. Konatsu was now very confused, until he 
remembered that Nerima had some weird people in it, some of whom were 
aquamorphs. Using his ninja skills Konatsu pulled a boiling teakettle 
out of nowhere and poured it on the cat, causing him to pass out from 
sudden blood loss. 

Unfortunately for Ukyo, when Shampoo transformed she found 
her hand in an embarrassing spot (no, not there, that would be a very 
embarrassing spot). Before she could remove her hand, Shampoo 
instinctually grabbed it and gasped &quot;Ah...Airen!&quot; Ukyo blushed, then 
blushed furiously as she noticed the recovering Konatsu staring wide 
eyed at her and the now moaning Shampoo, who was doing interesting 
things with Ukyo&#39;s captured hand. &quot;This isn&#39;t what it looks like!&quot; 
yelled Ukyo as she franticly waved her free hand in denial, not that 
it did any good; Konatsu had fallen unconscious from blood loss again.

&quot;Ohh...Airen...AIYAHH! You no Airen! What pervert gi.. 
spatula girl doing to me!&quot; screamed a now conscious Shampoo. 

&quot;Hey! You&#39;re the one was holding my hand there! All I was 
trying to do was save your drunk ass! What the hell were you doing 
getting so wasted?!&quot; 

&quot;Lying spatula girl! Shampoo no drink that much! Spatula 
girl knock out Shampoo to do ecchi things. Die!&quot; With that Shampoo 
lunged at Ukyo. Shampoo was faster and stronger than Ukyo, plus Ukyo 
wasn&#39;t trained in hand to hand combat. None of which made up for the 
fact that Shampoo was rather drunk. Ukyo didn&#39;t even need to 
sidestep. A moment later the naked amazon lay in an undignified heap 
amongst the remains of a table. Recovering quickly, she attempted to 
pull her trusty bonbori out of nowhere, but apparently she&#39;d lost 
nowhere along with her clothes, or perhaps she was to drunk to access 
nowhere, either way, the only thing she accomplished was making Ukyo 
snicker.

Ukyo&#39;s snicker died in her throat as Shampoo started 
growling and the restaurant filled with a menacing battle aura. &quot;Uh 
oh,&quot; thought the now sweating Ukyo. While she wasn&#39;t too worried 
about herself, she could dodge Shampoo&#39;s drunken attacks all night, 
the thought of how much property damage a raging drunk amazon could do 
was appalling. The restaurant was finally back in the black after 
that incident where she&#39;d foolishly let Akane, Ranchan, and Konatsu 
try and run the place. 

Before Shampoo could launch another attack her vision was 
obstructed by something being pulled over her head. &quot;KUNICHOI 
ULTIMATE NOSEBLEED DEFENSE TECHNIQUE: SHIRT SWAP!&quot; Yelled a close 
eyed Konatsu as he quickly dressed Shampoo in his ninja top. &quot;Gomen 
Xian Pu-san,&quot; apologized a now topless Konatsu as he surveyed his 
handiwork. He quickly looked away, a new trickle of blood running 
from his nose. His technique didn&#39;t quite live up to it&#39;s 
&quot;ultimatness&quot;. While he probably wouldn&#39;t pass out again, the ninja 
top was not a good fit. Shampoo had a lot more mass in certain areas 
than the small ninja, resulting in a tight fit that wasn&#39;t quite long 
enough for Konatsu&#39;s comfort. &quot;Please don&#39;t hurt Ukyo-sama,&quot; pleaded 
Konatsu. &quot;She really did bring you in as an unconscious cat. I think 
when your body shrunk the alcohol became more concentrated, thus 
causing you to have a lethal amount in your bloodstream,&quot; explained 
Konatsu as he interposed himself between the glowing Shampoo and Ukyo. 

There was a tense pause, then Shampoo&#39;s battle aura 
deflated. Ukyo let out her breath in a sigh of relief, then launched 
into an angry tirade, &quot;Thanks Shampoo. I go and save your life and 
all you can do is call me a pervert and try and kill me!&quot; 

&quot;Shampoo sorry Ukyo,&quot; mumbled a mollified amazon. 

&quot;Huh?&quot; that was the last thing Ukyo expected to hear from 
her rival. 

&quot;Say Shampoo sorry. Ukyo save life. Shampoo try take 
Ukyo&#39;s. That no right.&quot; Shampoo&#39;s eyes began to tear up and she 
collapsed onto her knees.

&quot;Uh, hey, look...its not that big a deal Shampoo...just a 
little misunderstanding...I&#39;d be pretty mad too if I woke up with some 
one, uh, you know... Hey, Shampoo, you hungry? I&#39;ll cook us up some 
okonomiyaki.&quot; 

Konatsu, convinced that Shampoo was no longer going to try 
and kill Ukyo-sama, decided to go take a cold shower and retire for 
the evening before he became anemic. 

As Ukyo fired up the grill Shampoo hesitantly took a seat by 
it and looked awkwardly at her lap. Finally she blurted out, &quot;Why 
Ukyo be so nice?! Shampoo no ever nice to Ukyo, Shampoo always mean. 
Shampoo no deserve nice!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you&#39;ve been an ungrateful bitch, but whether you 
deserve it or not I feel a little sorry for you. You want to talk 
about what got you so upset that you nearly killed yourself?&quot;

&quot;Thanks Ukyo,&quot; mumbled Shampoo, &quot;Thanks for saving Shampoo, 
and nice to Shampoo. First thing love of Ranma was nice when Shampoo 
no deserve,&quot; at this Shampoo eyes went into dreamy nostalgia mode, but 
the look was quickly replaced by one of regret. &quot;Shampoo sorry so mean 
to Ukyo before, *sigh* Shampoo...sorry for lots now.&quot; Shampoo slumped 
down on her stool, rested her chin on the counter, and reached out for 
her glass, except she wasn&#39;t in the bar any more so all her grasping 
hand found was the now fired up grill. Shampoo let loose with her 
trademark AIYAH! and many unprintable Chinese expletives (translation: 
the author is to lazy to go look any up).

&quot;Heh, thought only Ryogua was dumb enough to do that. 
Here&#39;s an icepack sugar,&quot; said Ukyo as she opened up the freezer and 
threw an icepack to the amazon. Shampoo tried to catch the icepack, 
but somehow it slipped past her hand and knocked her upside the head. 
Amid a shower of ice Shampoo toppled off her stool and crashed to the 
floor. &quot;Oops, sorry Shampoo. Forgot your coordination&#39;s shot to hell 
right now.&quot; 

&quot;You do that on purpose.&quot; Ukyo couldn&#39;t help but giggle as 
she looked down at Shampoo&#39;s pouting face and ill dressed form 
sprawled across the floor. Soon Shampoo joined the chef in her fit of 
giggles. As the two girls laughter died down Shampoo accepted Ukyo&#39;s 
outstretched hand and unsteadily got back on her stool. 

Ukyo placed a second icepack in Shampoo&#39;s hand and then 
returned her attention to the grill. Shampoo watched the chef work 
her magic in amazement. She worked so quickly, but not at the expense 
of quality noted Shampoo as the batter come down in two perfectly even 
circles. The look of absolute focus on Ukyo&#39;s face was as captivating 
as the artistic precision of her handiwork upon the okonomiyaki. A 
flick of her spatula sent the okonomiyaki up in the air, then with a 
dramatic flourish and triumphant smile she applied the final strokes 
of sauce. Shampoo gasped, fearing that Ukyo&#39;s masterpiece would be 
ruined on impact, but at the last moment the chef nonchalantly slid a 
plate down the counter. It skidded to a halt just in time to catch 
the still sizzling okonomayaki in front of Shampoo. She couldn&#39;t help 
but applaud the performance and smile at the genki kanji Ukyo had 
drawn in the middle. &quot;Wow! Ukyo love making miyaki stuff, neh?&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s o-ko-no-mi-ya-ki.&quot;

&quot;Whatever.&quot;

&quot;But yeah, I guess I really do get into it,&quot; said Ukyo as 
she wiped off a bead of sweat and flicked back a stray hair. 
Shampoo&#39;s lids lowered, surprised that such a little movement could 
make Ukyo seem to sparkle so. &quot;Whenever I start cooking it&#39;s like the 
rest of the world disappears and there are no worries. I&#39;m carefree, 
just like when I was a kid. Okonomiyaki&#39;s always been a part of my 
life. Every morning I&#39;d wake up to that comforting heat from the 
grill and be greeted by the scent of father&#39;s cooking. Even before I 
could walk I was learning how to cook.&quot; 

&quot;My earliest memory is of sitting in my dads lap and making 
these baby sized okonomiyaki with a set of miniature spatulas I&#39;d got 
for my birthday. They were the only present I&#39;d got that day because 
my mom&#39;s medical expenses had put us in debt, but I felt like the 
luckiest kid in the world. When I&#39;d finished cooking Mom insisted on 
getting up to see over Dad&#39;s objections that she should stay in bed. 
She told me the pictures in the sauce were really cute and that she 
was so proud of me, that when I grew up she was sure I&#39;d be a great 
chef or artist. She asked if she could please have one and I remember 
being so proud when she said it was the best okonomayaki she&#39;d ever 
tasted. I asked her why she was crying and she said it was because 
she was happy, so happy that she&#39;d got to have a wonderful child like 
me... Hey! Whatcha lookin at!&quot; Ukyo nostalgia suddenly broke as she 
became self conscious of Shampoo gazing at her with chin resting in 
the palm of her hands.

&quot;N-nothing! said a suddenly self conscious Shampoo, 
&quot;Ukyo...voice just was much entrancing.&quot; Ukyo gave Shampoo a funny 
look so the blushing amazon quickly added, &quot;Just surprising, Ukyo 
voice usually real annoying and whiny, like blah blah Jackass! blah 
blah Ranma mine blah blah stupid gaijin bimbo blah blah blah. Must 
be pretty memory make voice sound nice.&quot; 

&quot;At least I don&#39;t sound like some stupid little spoiled brat 
who can&#39;t even use pronouns correctly,&quot; huffed Ukyo.

&quot;...um, Shampoo always wonder, where Ukyo&#39;s parents now? 
Unusual live lone.&quot;

&quot;...Mom didn&#39;t want to ruin my birthday. S-she held out 
until I&#39;d went to bed...&quot; An awkward silence descended as this new 
piece of Ukyo made Shampoo feel the bittersweetness of her precious 
memory. Shampoo was surprised to find that she could tear up for 
someone else. She knew she should say something, but by the time 
she&#39;d dried her eyes and looked up Ukyo&#39;s back was turned and it 
seemed to awkward. 

&quot;I grew up pretty fast. I&#39;ve always been independent. Dad 
already had a steady clientele down in Kyoto when I finally tracked 
down Ranma and his old man, we didn&#39;t want him to lose another 
business to them so I headed to Nerima alone. I&#39;d already learned 
everything I could from Dad and we both felt I could take care of 
myself. Now that my business is doing well too it just hasn&#39;t made 
since for either of us to move in with the other.&quot;

&quot;But... don&#39;t Ukyo get lonely?&quot;

&quot;Well, yeah, sometimes it gets a little lonely, but... hey! 
Why are the hell are we talking about me anyway?! Our okonomiyaki is 
going to get cold if we keep yapping. Let&#39;s eat!&quot;

Shampoo hesitantly raised her chopsticks to her mouth and 
slowly chewed the unfamiliar food. &quot;Is...is much good!&quot; said a 
surprised Shampoo after she swallowed the first bite. &quot;Ukyo good 
cook...better than Shampoo.&quot; Ukyo stared at Shampoo in shock, 
chopsticks frozen in mid descent. The amazon didn&#39;t notice as the 
first bite of food had awoken her hunger and she was now devouring her 
food ravenously, sans chopsticks. All to quickly her food was gone 
and Shampoo noticed Ukyo staring at her now sauce stained face. 
Shampoo smiled evilly and then her good hand lashed out toward Ukyo. 

&quot;Stupid! Never should have let my guard down around her,&quot; 
thought Ukyo as her eyes flinched shut and she braced for the blow, 
which never came. She opened her eyes and there was Shampoo finishing 
off the remains of her okonomiyaki. 

&quot;You should seen face Ukyo,&quot; giggled Shampoo as she pointed 
at the flustered Chef. 

&quot;Why you little sneak, that was mine!&quot; shouted Ukyo as she 
dove over the counter and tackled the still giggling amazon. The two 
knocked chairs and tables over as they rolled across the restaurant 
floor. Ukyo was surprised at how strong Shampoo was. True, she&#39;d 
fought Shampoo a couple times, but it had always been with weapons, 
never hand to hand. Soon Ukyo found herself pinned underneath the 
amazon warrior, their faces an inch apart. &quot;You&#39;re one to talk pig, 
you should get a look at your face.&quot;

&quot;All covered in food, yes?&quot; said Shampoo with a mischievous 
glint in her eye. &quot;You want food, eat food off Sham.... ack!&quot; Shampoo 
gasped as Ukyo drove her knee into her rivals gut. 

&quot;Um, no thanks, I&#39;m not really that hungry anyway, could you 
um, get off me?&quot; said a nervous Ukyo. Ukyo&#39;s nervousness changed to 
desperation as she saw Shampoo&#39;s face get a sick expression on it. 
&quot;Oh fuck! Shampoo don&#39;t you dar....... .....&quot;

&quot;Um, at least Ukyo get miyaki stuff back?&quot; 

Ukyo&#39;s glowering eyes began to twitch. &quot;Get...Off...Now.&quot; 

&quot;Sorry,&quot; whispered Shampoo as she meekly complied. Ukyo 
felt her anger melt as Shampoo once again started to tear up. She 
was surprised that she wasn&#39;t getting any satisfaction at seeing her 
usually so cool and controlled rival break down. 

&quot;It&#39;s okay sugar, its not like you did it on purpose,&quot; said 
Ukyo as she took off her stinking shirt and headed over to the sink. 

As she was washing it out Shampoo asked, &quot;Ukyo have any 
sake?&quot;

&quot;Not for you, you&#39;re wasted enough as it is sugar. Besides, 
it won&#39;t make whatever&#39;s hurting you stop, just make you lose sight of 
it for a little while. What kind of amazon are you anyway, running 
away to a bottle like some weak man instead of facing your problem?&quot;

Ukyo could feel Shampoo&#39;s battle aura start to flare up 
behind her, then just as quickly die down. &quot;Ukyo right, Shampoo 
coward, no want to see what in front of her whole time.&quot;

&quot;And that is...&quot; said Ukyo over her shoulder as she finished 
washing off her face and shirt. She had a feeling she knew why 
Shampoo was so upset, and a part of her was going to enjoy hearing 
Shampoo admit it. She felt a little guilty, but it was for the best 
that Shampoo finally got it through her thick head that...

&quot;R-ranma...no love Shampoo.&quot;


* * *


Earlier that day...

&quot;So, Shampoo, do you think your conduct at the wedding 
endeared you towards son-in-law?&quot; asked Cologne in a deceptively 
casual tone as she entered the kitchen where Shampoo was washing 
dishes from the lunch customers. 

Shampoo looked nervously at her grandmother and then turned 
back to the dishes. &quot;O-of course, me save him...&quot; Shampoo stopped as 
Cologne hopped up in front of her and looked her in the eye. Shampoo 
looked into the sink as she finished weakly, &quot;...from marry v-violent 
girl.&quot; 

&quot;Now, now Shampoo, those meek Japs may not look each other 
in the eye, but we are Amazons, we do not act in such a deceptive and 
shameful manner.&quot; 

&quot;Where Mouse been! Clean dishes his stupid job! Stupid 
lazy male! Me go find and put in place!&quot; shouted Shampoo as she tried 
to quickly leave. She didn&#39;t get very far before she got tripped up 
by Cologne&#39;s staff. 

&quot;No need to do that. I&#39;ve been debriefing him about what 
happened over in China. You two are the only Amazons who&#39;ve seen the 
Phoenix mountain court and lived to tell about it in over a century. 
Rather interesting, his version of a couple of events you both 
witnessed was much more detailed than yours. I don&#39;t recall having 
asked you to skim over important details when I questioned you, or 
utterly fail to mention that Akane was even there. If you aren&#39;t 
married to Ranma when we return to the village you&#39;ll be tried you 
know. We wouldn&#39;t want to add deceiving the matriarch to your list of 
offenses, now would we?&quot; Despite the still casual tone Shampoo 
shuddered. 

&quot;Please, don&#39;t make me remember Jusendo,&quot; thought Shampoo as 
she looked pleadingly into her great grandmothers eyes. Ancient 
implacable eyes glared coolly back at her. While Shampoo was afraid 
of what her matriarch could do to her for concealing certain events, 
she was much more terrified of those events. She had been trying to 
forget them, and when that failed she told herself that they didn&#39;t 
mean anything. But now, seeing her terrified face reflected in those 
ancient eyes she could no longer deny the horrible truth that those 
events represented.

Ranma, losing all will to live when he thought Akane had 
died saving him. His tenderness when he thought he had failed to 
revive her. Shampoo couldn&#39;t remember what exactly he said, not that 
it mattered considering Ranma&#39;s aptitude with words. But the emotion 
and intent behind them had been clear, he was trying to tell Akane how 
much he loved her.

&quot;NOOOOO!! NO! NO! NO! NO! It no true! Damn it! It no 
true!&quot; shouted Shampoo desperately. 

&quot;Shampoo, cease this shameful display. It is especially 
unbecoming for one of my blood and who was my heir,&quot; admonished 
Cologne.

Shampoo looked at her grandmother with horror, &quot;G-
grandmother... you no serious...!&quot;

&quot;I certainly am child. While you have the skills and 
intelligence, a matriarch can not allow emotions to cloud her 
objectivity. Someone who will not face up to truth can not be 
entrusted to make decisions for the tribe. I lost face in front of 
the elders when you failed to kill Ranma, and will lose face again if 
you fail to return with him, particularly considering the false claims 
you&#39;ve made in the Amazon newsletter. My status in the tribe is 
fairly secure, but I&#39;m sure you can see that it would be wise to 
distance myself from your failures.&quot;

The implications of what Cologne was saying caused Shampoo 
to collapse from dread. Her own grandmother wasn&#39;t going to stick by 
her once they returned. Last time she&#39;d gotten off easy because of 
Cologne&#39;s intervention. There were many who&#39;d grumbled about the 
special treatment she&#39;d received and would love a chance to make up 
for her last punishments leniency. Certainly she&#39;d be stripped of her 
property and status at the very least. As if losing the one person 
she had ever loved wasn&#39;t enough, now she was going to lose everything 
else that had given her life meaning. &quot;Please, Grandmother, no do 
this to Shampoo... you know Shampoo have many enemies back home,&quot; 
whispered Shampoo desperately.

&quot;I know Shampoo, you can bet they will be cruel to you if 
the council strips you of your status. It will be a hard time for 
you,&quot; said Cologne gently, &quot;Though it may seem unbearable you must be 
strong and never forget of whose bloodline you are. As long as your 
alive there is hope, I have not selected a replacement heir, if you 
redeem yourself in the eyes of the tribe your status could be 
restored.&quot;

Her Elder&#39;s sympathy felt like salt in Shampoo&#39;s wound. 
Outright rejection would be easier to endure than this useless pity. 
Shampoo&#39;s eyes went from soft to hard as a suspicion entered her mind. 
&quot;How long you know?&quot;

&quot;Ever since my duel with Neko-Ranma. It was fairly obvious 
from his behavior towards Akane when his inhibitions were removed by 
the cat fist. Why do you think I gave him the Phoenix pill? I 
probably could have defeated even his cat fist technique, (of course 
there was a slight chance I might have lost, and considering his lack 
of moral inhibitions and dislike of me at the time that would have 
been fatal, added Cologne to herself), but when I realized how Ranma 
truly felt I decided that forcing him into marriage would be a bad 
idea. He would bear us too much resentment. So I tried some subtler 
approaches and left winning him over mostly in your hands, especially 
after the incident with the reversal jewel revealed that the feelings 
between them were mutual.&quot; 

&quot;You...know...all this time, and no tell?! Make Shampoo 
waste time in stupid Japan chasing illusion?!&quot; sputtered an angry 
Shampoo. Then she did something that she never would have done if 
she&#39;d been thinking clearly instead of being an emotional wreck. She 
attacked Cologne. With the predictable result of her flying out of 
the kitchen .42 seconds later. 

&quot;Shampoo!&quot; cried a concerned Mousse as he rushed over to his 
beloved&#39;s side. Upon seeing that she was sobbing he realized that now 
was his chance! He would comfort her and let her cry on his shoulder, 
after which she would realize her true feelings for him. 

Shampoo stiffened as she suddenly found her face being 
forced into Mousse&#39;s shoulder. Mousse was experiencing to much bliss 
from holding Shampoo to note the signs that should&#39;ve warned him to 
get the hell away from her as quickly as possible. Such as the low 
growl in the back of her throat. The cracking of her knuckles. The 
tensing of her entire body. Or even the battle aura which filled up 
the restaurant and made his sleeves catch on fire. &quot;Oh, I can feel 
the flame of your passion Sham...&quot; Mouse never got any farther as 
Shampoo started slamming him back and forth like a rag doll and then 
dropped kicked him all the way into next fanfic. 

Cologne entered the dining room in time to see Shampoo run 
out through the nearest exit, that being the one she made for herself 
in the wall. *sigh* &quot;I thought I&#39;d finally taught her to use doors. 
Oh well, I guess I&#39;ll overlook it this one time. Poor thing, 
tempering can be so painful, but it&#39;s for the best.&quot; Cologne had 
noted for awhile that Shampoo harbored a very unamazon romanticism. 
She was glad that Ranma was such a perfect man for shattering it. 
Shampoo would learn to deal with losing and that things wouldn&#39;t 
always go her way, valuable lessons which she&#39;d never experienced back 
in the village. Of course, there was still the problem of how to 
serve the evening rush without two of her workers. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Moshi! Moshi!&quot; said a relived voice on the other end of 
the line.

&quot;Don&#39;t think I don&#39;t see through you! You always let 
someone else pick up the phone, you lazy baka. Well, this stir fry I 
cooked for us isn&#39;t going anywhere!&quot; this voice in contrast was quite 
irritated.

&quot;Greetings son-in-law, I&#39;ve a favor to ask of you and 
Akane.&quot;

&quot;A favor?&quot; replied a wary Ranma. 

&quot;Yes, Shampoo and Mouse have... suddenly become unavailable. 
I was wondering if you two could temporarily fill in.&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; said Ranma quickly, as if he was grabbing onto a 
lifeline, &quot;I&#39;ll be at the Cat Caf, right away.&quot; KLONK! Cologne 
flinched sympathetically from the sound of a wok colliding with the 
back of a skull and the sizzle of hot oil on flesh. &quot;Stupid uncute 
tomboy, ya said the stir fry wasn&#39;t going anywhe...&quot; Cologne could 
well imagine Akane&#39;s look of betrayal and rage that had made her 
foolish fianc, fall silent. 

&quot;H-how could you! After I worked so hard to make us a nice 
meal, y-you go run off to that hussy&#39;s restaurant!&quot;

&quot;W-wait Akane, it&#39;s not like that, ya see...um, wait, I 
guess it&#39;s sorta like that... um, what I mean is...&quot; unfortunately 
Ranma&#39;s brain was short circuiting as it always did around crying 
females. 

&quot;I DON&#39;T CARE WHAT ITS LIKE! YOU CAN GO HAVE YOUR DATE OR 
WHATEVER WITH SHAMPOO FOR ALL I CARE. AT LEAST SHE CAN COOK, RIGHT!&quot; 
This was accompanied by the sound of someone being drop kicked through 
the roof. 

Cologne hung up the phone with one hand and caught Ranma 
right before he hit the floor with the other. &quot;Well, that was quick 
son-in-law. Your old uniform from when you used to wait tables is in 
back, go change,&quot; before Ranma could protest Cologne added, &quot;and I&#39;ll 
let Akane know what&#39;s going on and whip you both up something to eat 
before the evening rush hits.&quot;

Ranma opened his mouth to say that he&#39;d straighten that 
stupid tomboy out himself, but then realized that Akane would never 
listen to him and that he&#39;d just make things worse. &quot;Agarito 
gazaimus,&quot; said Ranma sincerely as he bowed to the elder, and then 
with a mischief smirk added, &quot;old ghoul.&quot; 

&quot;Who you calling old ghoul, son-in-law,&quot; said Cologne with 
mock annoyance as she took a swing at him with her staff. Ranma 
easily dodged with a backwards flip. 

&quot;Ha! looks like your age is finally catching up to you 
granny. That was so slow I could have dodged it in my...&quot; *SPLASH* 
*CRASH* Ranma looked up in time to gulp as a mop handle thrust like 
lightning to within a millimeter of her throat.

&quot;As long as your knocking over soap buckets you might as 
well as well clean the floor. Now go finish changing son-in-law.&quot; 
Cologne chuckled as Ranma grabbed the mop and stormed into the 
kitchen. He was an impertinent young fool, but that&#39;s what Cologne 
liked about him. It had been so refreshing to find someone who wasn&#39;t 
tactful around her and wouldn&#39;t be intimidated. She was going to miss 
him. Even if he wouldn&#39;t acknowledge it he&#39;d always be family to her. 
Hopefully he cared enough for them that he&#39;d at least help Shampoo 
fulfill the spirit of the law if not the letter. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;R-ranma no love Shampoo.&quot; 

&quot;What took you so long?&quot; said Ukyo derisively, forgetting 
tact in her moment of triumph. Then she noticed Shampoo&#39;s silent 
tears and mentally slapped herself. &quot;Ukyo, you jerk. How would you 
feel if you found out Ranchan didn&#39;t love you?&quot; Ukyo shuddered at the 
emptiness the thought brought and quickly shoved it away. &quot;Shampoo 
needs someone to console her, not rub her face in it.&quot; 

Shampoo took a good look at Ukyo and then threw back her 
head in a bitter laugh that made Ukyo&#39;s skin crawl. &quot;You think Ranma 
Ukyo&#39;s now, hehheh, you no get. Ranma no love Shampoo, Ranma no love 
Ukyo, cause Ranma love violent girl.&quot;

Ukyo let loose her own nervous laughter and folded her arms 
over her bandaged chest. &quot;You&#39;ve gotta be kiddin sugar. You ever 
watched those two? They&#39;re always arguing and hitting each other. 
The only reason they&#39;re together is because of some promise Ranchan&#39;s 
lousy father made, as if those are worth anything. Ranchan&#39;s old man 
only wants to mooch off the Tendo&#39;s and get the training hall. That 
way his son can support him and he won&#39;t ever have to get off his fat 
ass and do any real work. Eventually the Tendo&#39;s will wise up and 
kick that worthless free loader out and end that farce engagement. 
Then Ranchan will be all _mine_ ! Mwhahahaha!&quot;

&quot;Shampoo seem remember Ukyo and Shampoo get mad at Ranma and 
hit too. Not as much as violent girl, she spend more time with Ranma 
so get much annoyed by him more. Of course me only see times when we 
both with Ranma, Shampoo much yell and hit Ranma when you no around.&quot;

Ukyo had to admit that Shampoo had a point, she could think 
of numerous times she&#39;d smacked Ranma and got annoyed with him when 
Shampoo hadn&#39;t been around to witness it. She really couldn&#39;t claim 
much high ground over Akane there.

&quot;Ukyo was no at Jusendo. No see what Shampoo see. Akane 
give life for save Ranma. Ranma think Akane dead, give up living. 
Then kill god for her. Try tell how much love her when think fail to 
save. Shampoo no want admit, but no longer can deny. Ranma love 
Akane, Akane love Ranma.&quot;

Shampoo&#39;s tone was so grave and final that Ukyo found 
herself unable to deny her darkest fear. She wanted to think it was 
some deception of Shampoo&#39;s, but she wouldn&#39;t lie about something that 
meant Ranma didn&#39;t love her. What finally convinced Ukyo though was 
the haunted sincerity in Shampoo&#39;s eyes. &quot;No,&quot; whispered Ukyo with 
desperation as she felt the emptiness she had buried earlier 
resurface. 

&quot;Shampoo sorry Ukyo, wish not true, but is. Know how feel, 
dreams all shatter, leave big empty hurt much place.&quot; 

Ukyo&#39;s throat grew tight and a dull pain started in her 
chest. &quot;No, I&#39;m not going to cry over that jerk again,&quot; thought Ukyo. 
But then a gentle hands touched her shoulders and Shampoo whispered, 
&quot;Ukyo no have to hold in, is okay to cry.&quot; Before she knew it she was 
sobbing into Shampoo&#39;s shoulder as the amazon enfolded her in a gentle 
embrace. As Ukyo let loose her tears Shampoo stroked Ukyo&#39;s hair 
(undoing her ponytail in the process) and murmured &quot;it okay,&quot; over and 
over. 

It felt surprisingly good to comfort Ukyo. Shampoo 
remembered how horrible it had been when realization had struck and 
there had been no one there for her (well okay, there was Mousse, but 
he didn&#39;t count), except the nearest bar. Ukyo wouldn&#39;t have to face 
the pain alone. And it felt nice being close to someone with out them 
trying to break free like Ranma always did. After a few minutes Ukyo 
regained her composure and Shampoo reluctantly let her go. 

&quot;T-thanks Shampoo,&quot; said a puffy eyed Ukyo, &quot;I&#39;m sorry about 
going all to pieces like that.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; said Shampoo, brushing it aside. Then her 
tone become a conspiratorial whisper as she asked, &quot;Ukyo get out sake 
now?&quot;

&quot;Heh. Sure, why the hell not.&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------------

Ukyo was feeling a bit more relaxed now that she and Shampoo 
had passed the bottle back and forth a couple of times. She was 
finally ready to start talking about that jerk. &quot;Ya got it lucky 
sugar, you&#39;ll get over Ranma easy. You were just in love with him 
cause that stupid law of yours.&quot; 

Shampoo snorted and turned up her nose. &quot;Ukyo stupid one, 
not law. Law make much sense.&quot; 

&quot;Oh sure, Shampoo, if you&#39;re beat by a girl kill her, but if 
it&#39;s a man you marry him, that&#39;s so primitive.&quot;

&quot;Ukyo no disrespect Amazon law! Ukyo think me and ways so 
stupid, but Ukyo one make ignorant talk!&quot; yelled Shampoo as she 
slammed her fist on the counter, causing it to crack. &quot;You wonder why 
&#39;primitive&#39; Amazons survive in fertile land when surrounded by you 
&#39;civilizeds&#39;? All tribes have land you &#39;civilizeds&#39; want be 
massacred, cept us,&quot; said Shampoo proudly, &quot;cause wise ancestors know 
we need be strong and defend land from greedy ones who grow with no 
limits.&quot;

&quot;Ukyo know survival of fittest? Amazon law weed out weaker 
females. Bring in new, stronger blood, keep from stagnating. Bring 
new ideas and fighting styles. Mating with foreigners keep us from 
being destroyed by Rome brought Plague of 161, unlike American 
Indians. Laws do other useful things to, but if no for them Amazons 
no would have been strong enough to defeat all who try destroy us in 
past and all who try in future. So how law stupid Ukyo?&quot; said Shampoo 
leaning over the counter and getting right into Ukyo&#39;s face.

Blink, blink. &quot;Uh, since when did you know so much 
Shampoo?&quot;

&quot;What Ukyo think, Shampoo stupid just cause no speak like 
you?&quot; Ukyo flinched at Shampoo&#39;s on target accusation. &quot;Hhmph. You 
not only one. Over hear &quot;stupid gaijing bimbo&quot; all time. Like see 
how well Ukyo speak Chinese after only there little while. Shampoo 
is... h-heir to matriarch, no can be stupid to do that. Shampoo know 
lots of things, do some reading in spare time. And no just mind 
dulling manga, real print books.&quot;

&quot;Well, I guess I can&#39;t call you a _stupid_ gaijing bimbo 
anymore,&quot; smirked Ukyo. 

&quot;Who Ukyo call bimbo? Shampoo been faithful to Airen,&quot; 
shouted an indignant Shampoo. 

&quot;Come on Shampoo, you dress like such a slut. I mean just 
look at yourself now,&quot; said Ukyo as she eyed Shampoo&#39;s current attire, 
which due to its small size only partially covered Shampoo&#39;s bush of 
purple hair and squashed her breasts in a rather lurid manner. Before 
Shampoo could protest that this wasn&#39;t her fault Ukyo continued, &quot;And 
there our all those times you go flashing your naked body or don&#39;t 
bother wearing any bras or panties so everyone can see you bouncin 
around. You might as well have &quot;Fuck me Ranma&quot; written all over you.&quot;

&quot;Not all Shampoo fault! Stupid pervert boys or old pervert 
always stealing panties before Shampoo turn back from cat and get 
back! Always running out.&quot; 

&quot;Hmm, ever tried not wearing such tempting soft and shiny 
lingerie?&quot; 

&quot;Hmmphh,&quot; sniffed Shampoo as she turned up her nose at the 
very thought of it, &quot;Shampoo like silk feel. Assets deserve worthy 
containers,&quot; stated Shampoo arrogantly as she arched her back and 
leisurely stretched her arms over her head. It was with satisfaction 
that she noted Ukyo staring at her. &quot;Amazons no &quot;bimbos.&quot; Just 
different culture, different dress standard, smart one like comfy and 
practical. Which flat chest ninja girl top no is,&quot; snarled Shampoo 
distastefully as she slowly ripped Konatsu&#39;s ninja top down the 
middle, turning it into a jacket and allowing her breasts to 
thankfully become free of the confining prison they&#39;d been in. 

As Shampoo&#39;s breasts came to a stop Ukyo suddenly realized 
she&#39;d be staring and quickly looked away blushing. &quot;Since when where 
yours that big?&quot; muttered an envious Ukyo, then blushed even deeper 
when she realized Shampoo heard her. 

&quot;Ranma and Akane no only ones &#39;maturing&#39;,&quot; smirked Shampoo 
as she took another leisurely stretch and sighed at how pleasant it 
felt now that she wasn&#39;t so confined.

&quot;Stop that!&quot; shouted Ukyo, &quot;Weren&#39;t you trying to convince 
me you _weren&#39;t_ some bimbo slut?! Just rub my face in it why don&#39;t 
you?&quot;

&quot;Okay!,&quot; shouted Shampoo with enthusiastic playfulness. 
Ukyo suddenly founded her self embraced over the counter into 
Shampoo&#39;s ample cleavage. 

&quot;Mmmphhhmmm, mmmphhhmm, MPHM!&quot; cried an indignant Ukyo, 
stopping as she realized that having her mouth open was making this 
awkward situation much worse as Shampoo made good on Ukyo&#39;s 
suggestion. Ukyo&#39;s attempted futilely to break free, but she stood no 
chance against the perfected art of Amazon glomping. However, once 
Shampoo felt that Ukyo realized who was in control she eased up and 
let her break free, eyeing the red faced and panting chef with a 
sultry smirk.

&quot;Shampoo you...you... Jackass!&quot; sputtered Ukyo, &quot;What the 
hell do you think your doing!&quot;

&quot;Was Ukyo sugges...,&quot; pointed out Shampoo, as the top of her 
head got aquatinted with Ukyo&#39;s spatula.

&quot;HENTAI!&quot; shouted Ukyo at a dazed Shampoo who was seeing 
stars on the floor. 

&quot;Hmpphh. Ukyo one talk, what with inhaling Shampoo breast 
like that...&quot; retorted Shampoo with a little smile as she got back up 
to her feet

And immediately was knocked back down as Ukyo snarled, &quot;Shut 
up! That was an accident!&quot; 

&quot;Ok, ok. Shampoo sorry,&quot; said Shampoo to the floor she was 
imbedded in, &quot;Ukyo put away spatula now?&quot;

Ukyo&#39;s only response was a grunt, but as Shampoo peeked up 
she saw Ukyo slip the spatula under the counter. Now that the coast 
was clear Shampoo climbed unsteadily back up onto her stool, the 
alcohol and ringing in her head making it a difficult task. 

An short awkward silence followed in which the only sound to 
be heard was the girls taking swigs from the bottle. Shampoo finally 
broke it by saying quietly, &quot;Shampoo no fall in love with Ranma cause 
of law, law no applied.&quot; 

Ukyo kept drinking, but then what Shampoo had said 
registered and sake spluttered everywhere, &quot;W-WHAT?!&quot;

&quot;Ranma no defeat me, Shampoo no attacking him, he no 
attacking Shampoo. Just try disarm. Shampoo no even realize what 
Ranma try do, attack from Shampoo blind spot. It not like law make 
Amazon marry someone who knock out from behind. And Shampoo only 
stunned moment, take lot to knock out Shampoo. Council would no 
accept that kiss of marriage if they knew, be very angry with Shampoo. 
Shampoo no know then that Ranma great fighter.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t believe this,&quot; said Ukyo darkly, &quot;All this time 
you... Why would you twist your law to try and trap someone you hardly 
knew at the time? Actually, this isn&#39;t the only time you&#39;ve played 
fast and loose with your &quot;vaunted&quot; Amazon traditions is it? I seem to 
remember back when we teamed up to deal with Mrs. Hinako you gave her 
the kiss of death. Whatever happened to that sugar?&quot;

Shampoo blushed and looked awkwardly at her lap, &quot;Heh, not 
first time either. Back before Ukyo here Shampoo kiss pervert girl. 
Shampoo no really meant it, just wanted to scare off so she stop 
getting in way. Ranma tell Shampoo he really girl to protect Akane, 
even though it meant that Shampoo must then kill. Airen always so 
selfless when matters most. *sigh*&quot;

&quot;Except you didn&#39;t kill Ranchan, what I don&#39;t get is why? I 
mean, what was holding you to her? You&#39;d just met this guy who you 
didn&#39;t know anything about who turns out to be the girl you&#39;ve been 
hunting all across China and Japan. That should have killed your 
groundless infatuation right there.&quot;

&quot;Not infatuation!&quot; shouted a suddenly angry Shampoo.

&quot;Oh come on Shampoo, you&#39;d been there for just a couple 
days. It&#39;s not like you&#39;d been his child hood friend or anything and 
knew him at all. What else could it be?&quot;

&quot;Shampoo did love Ranma,&quot; insisted Shampoo softly but 
fiercely. &quot;Ukyo realize that everything in Shampoo life, all culture 
and teachings and upbringings say must kill Ranma? And Shampoo know 
if no kill lose face before tribe and punished by elders?! UKYO THINK 
SHAMPOO IGNORE UPBRINGING, LOSE STATUS AND RESPECT IN TRIBE AND GET 
CURSED FOR SOMETHING AS WEAK AS INFATUATION?!!&quot; Shampoo&#39;s tone grew 
louder and louder as she leaned in closer and closer to a sweating 
Ukyo who was beginning to realize how badly she&#39;d underestimated the 
Amazon. She&#39;d always considered Shampoo real shallow, never imagining 
she could be capable of such depth and sincerity of feeling. She&#39;d 
always seemed like such a self confident care free airhead. Ukyo 
always envied that about her, that she never seemed to have any angst 
or suffering or self doubt. To Ukyo&#39;s relief Shampoo slumped back on 
her stool and finished as quietly as she&#39;d began, &quot;Shampoo may no have 
known him well, but knew her.&quot; 

&quot;W-wait, Shampoo are you... saying... that... um...&quot; 
stammered Ukyo.

&quot;Shampoo need spell out for Ukyo?&quot; sneered Shampoo, &quot;Shampoo 
fell love with Ranma before ever meet boy type.&quot;

&quot;..... . . . I-I&#39;d always wondered about that. You&#39;d always 
make passes and glomp Ranma even if he was a girl and there were other 
people watching.&quot;

&quot;Ukyo sound jealous.&quot; 

&quot;WHAT! Why&#39;d I be... j-jealous!&quot; 

&quot;Cause Shampoo able express affections, no have stupid 
inhibitions,&quot; Shampoo said seriously. Then taking on a leer she 
added, &quot;Glomp girl Ranma even better than boy, neh? Get rub breasts 
together.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t know,&quot; sniffed Ukyo, who was trying to keep her 
blush from spreading. There was something about the way Shampoo said 
things that made them to easy to imagine. 

&quot;Heh, Ukyo should try some time. Make Ranma blush much, she 
so kawaii then. Hhhmm, Ukyo get much kawaii when embarrassed too.&quot; 
This only worsened Ukyo&#39;s blush, causing Shampoo to break out into a 
fit giggles. It was a bright and bubbly sound, without a trace of 
contempt in it. Ukyo found it surprisingly infectious and couldn&#39;t 
help but join in and laugh at herself.

&quot;Heh, yeah, she is real cute when she gets embarrassed. I&#39;d 
like to see _you_ blush, or does the amazon princess never lose her 
cool?&quot; Ukyo was rewarded by a slight coloring of Shampoo&#39;s cheeks. 
&quot;Huh, it does make her look kawaii,&quot; thought Ukyo to herself.

&quot;Well, Shampoo once see naked Ryogua and ...&quot; Shampoo leaned 
in and whispered something to Ukyo, who&#39;s eyes got real big.

&quot;No way! You&#39;re exaggerating,&quot; said Ukyo in disbelief.

&quot;Is true! Shampoo see what with own two eyes, no can forget 
thing like that!&quot;

&quot;Tadima! Sorry I&#39;m late Akari, got a little los...&quot; Ryogua 
looked around confused. &quot;Um, hello... Ukyo... Shampoo... what are you 
doing... at Akari&#39;s farm... uh... is there something on my pants?&quot; 
asked Ryogau as he looked down. There was something about the way 
Ukyo was staring that was making him real nervous. &quot;Oh, wait.... 
this is a restaurant... I didn&#39;t know you&#39;d... um... opened...a 
new...restaurant...in the country...&quot; Suddenly Ryogau noted the 
current state of attire of the two girls. A couple of weeks ago he 
would have passed out, but Akari had been helping him build up his 
endurance. He did get a nose bleed, but that wasn&#39;t the main place 
blood was rushing.

&quot;...we&#39;llbeshuretotryitoutsometimecya!&quot; Ryogua got out of 
there as fast as he could. The look Ukyo was giving him now was 
scaring him. There was something weird going on there and he had the 
feeling he didn&#39;t want to know what. He prayed that he found Akari 
soon, otherwise he was going to have this raging pain all evening. 

&quot;Man,&quot; whistled Ukyo, &quot;Akari sure is lucky.&quot; She then 
looked over at Shampoo, who was holding her beet red face in her 
hands, and let out a loud laugh.

&quot;Ukyo no need be so obvious!&quot;

&quot;Well, well. I guess Mrs. No Stupid Inhibitions does have 
some modesty after all. As if I could help checking it out after what 
you said.&quot; Ukyo took a swig from the sake bottle and basked a bit in 
finally not being the flustered one. &quot;It must have been tough loving 
someone you were supposed to kill.&quot;

&quot;True true. Only Shampoo could no admit at time. Bury love 
deep down, pretend no there, but it desperately want burst free...&quot;

&quot;Wait! I got it! That must have been why you fell for 
Ranma so quickly! Your repressed love of girl Ranma must have 
subconsciously noted how similar boy Ranma was and transferred your 
unacceptable love of the girl you had to kill to the boy using the 
corollary of the same law as an excuse!&quot; &quot;Oh, I&#39;m so smart!&quot; thought 
Ukyo as she mentally patted herself on the back for figuring it out 
ahead of the story. 

There was a lot more to the Amazon than Ukyo had given her 
credit for, and she found herself genuinely wanting to know more about 
Shampoo. In a way it felt like making up for all the times she&#39;d 
never bothered reaching out to Shampoo and just writing her off as a 
shallow man grabbing rival. &quot;But how did you ever fall in love with a 
girl who you had to kill?&quot;

Shampoo took a deep breath. &quot;First Ukyo need know about 
what life like for Shampoo with Amazons. Back then Shampoo 
was...um...&quot; 

&quot;A bitch?&quot; suggested Ukyo. Shampoo looked at Ukyo darkly. 
&quot;Well you were, right? I can just imagine it.&quot; Ukyo&#39;s voice then 
took on an exaggerated sing song tone, &quot;Back then Shampoo big bitch. 
Shampoo sexiest and toughest amazon, not to mention arrogantest, and 
make sure other amazons no forget. Shampoo rub faces in it and rough 
up those who forget Shampoo superior everyone else.&quot; 

Shampoo grumbled, &quot;How Ukyo know?&quot;

&quot;I just guessed you acted pretty much like you do here.&quot;

After Shampoo recovered from her face fault she sniffled 
out, &quot;S-shampoo really s-such a... bitch?&quot;

&quot;Hell yeah! Urk&quot; Ukyo suddenly bit her tongue as Shampoo&#39;s 
sniffles increased and she began to tear up. &quot;Damn that girls so 
emotional tonight. Is it that time of month? Quick Ukyo you jerk, 
say something fast or you&#39;re going to have made her cry.&quot;

&quot;Hey, Shampoo. Cheer up,&quot; said Ukyo as she tilted Shampoo&#39;s 
chin and looked into her watery eyes, &quot;I think you&#39;ve changed. You 
haven&#39;t really been bitchy tonight. Hell, I&#39;ve been a lot more bitchy 
than you. And you know what, you are the sexiest and toughest, just 
work on not being the arrogantest.&quot; 

&quot;U-ukyo really mean that?&quot; said a starry eyed Shampoo.

&quot;Hell yeah!&quot; said Ukyo smiling.

&quot;Ukyo think Shampoo sexy!&quot;

&quot;Urk! Um...objectively, not per...!&quot; but Ukyo&#39;s objections 
fell on death ears as an exuberant Shampoo threw herself around the 
stunned chef, snuggled against her, and let out a blissful sigh of 
absolution.

&quot;Ukyo more or less right. Shampoo mother was heir to 
matriarch, very beautiful and greatest warrior. But cruel Musk 
warriors torture her, put scars on and injure bad. No able to use 
legs, no fight, so lose status. Mother determined Shampoo become what 
mother should have been. Make Shampoo train hard all time.&quot; Ukyo 
wasn&#39;t sure she was comfortable with the intimacy of this situation, 
but she couldn&#39;t just push Shampoo away while she was barring her 
soul. She was speaking so slowly and softly, Ukyo felt that Shampoo 
needed the strength and safety she was getting from the snuggling to 
go on. 

&quot;Shampoo no waste time playing with other children, Shampoo 
must train and be best. If no best then become like mother. Shampoo 
see, other amazons either give condescending pity or pick on mother 
cause low status. But if best no one can hurt or condescend. So 
Shampoo know must become best. But hard, g-get so lonely, and then... 
mother try teach bakentetsu...&quot; Ukyo let out a gasp at this, unable to 
imagine someone inflicting that training on a child, &quot;S-shampoo try so 
hard please mother... but hurt so much... no can find breaking 
point... to afraid... hurt to much for concentrate...something wrong 
inside, things broken... mother keeps yelling at me... don&#39;t want to 
try again... she mad a-and hit me... please no make Shampoo do 
again...&quot; Shampoo suddenly started sobbing and pleading desperately in 
unintelligible Chinese to a horrified Ukyo.

&quot;Shampoo,&quot; whispered Ukyo. &quot;Hey Shampoo! SHAMPOO! Snap 
out of it! You&#39;re safe now, no one&#39;s going to hurt you!&quot; Shouted 
Ukyo as she shook the hysterical amazon. Shampoo&#39;s managed to stop 
her frantic pleadings, but not her gasping sobs. &quot;Hey, you here me? 
It&#39;s ok. No one&#39;s going to hurt you,&quot; repeated Ukyo as she pulled 
Shampoo into a fierce protective hug. &quot;No one&#39;s going to hurt you.&quot; 
The two of them just stayed like that for a while, Ukyo holding 
Shampoo close and whispering &quot;It&#39;s ok. No one&#39;s going to hurt you,&quot; 
over and over as she rocked the sobbing amazon back and forth.
