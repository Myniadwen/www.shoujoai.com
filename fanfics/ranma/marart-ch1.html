<pre>Episode One:  The Twins

------------------------------------------------

Soun Tendo walked out from his house with a backpack on his 
shoulder while his three daughters accompanied him to the front 
gate.  The youngest, Akane, looked at him with a mixture of doubt 
and worry; he smiled back at her to reassure her that everything 
would be all right.  She did not look convinced.

He felt that everything would be good hands with Kasumi in charge; 
she had certainly grown up and taken charge of the household duties 
when his wife died.  She was 19 now, and he had begun to worry 
about her finding a husband.  Maybe it was time to arrange one.  He 
hugged her and said &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be back in a week, and Mrs. 
Saotome will be coming here.  Take good care of the house.&quot;

He hugged Nabiki next, the package of snacks crackled as they were 
squashed when her hands met behind his neck.  He supposed that he 
ought to be worried that she seemed to be eating all the time, but she 
never seemed to gain any weight.  He thought to himself &quot;Ah well, 
she&#39;s only 17, she must still be a growing girl.  Maybe this is just a 
phase.&quot;  He wondered briefly where she was getting the money from 
as he didn&#39;t think that her allowance was quite that large.

He hugged Akane last.  She had been indignant when he told her 
that she and Ranma were engaged.  She had given all her objections; 
that she was only 16, that she didn&#39;t know him at all, that she wasn&#39;t 
ready for such a relationship, and so on.  Eventually, Kasumi 
convinced her to at least meet him, reminding her that they had 
already met previously though they hadn&#39;t seen each other for at 
least five years.  Since mother&#39;s death, really.

Kasumi had borne up well at the funeral, but Nabiki and Akane had 
cried and held on tightly to Ranko and Ranma.  If Genma had taken 
them on a long training trip at that time, Soun wouldn&#39;t have known 
how the family would have coped.  Soun said &quot;I&#39;m sure that Ranma&#39;s 
a fine person, Akane.  I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll have anything to worry 
about.&quot; and started to walk down the street.

Soun waved as he turned the corner and the three sisters waved 
back.  He looked forward to seeing his old friends, Genma and 
Nodoka, and their twins, Ranma and Ranko for the first time in 
years.

***************

According to the address on the postcard, Soun was almost at 
Genma&#39;s house.  According to the deal that they had made with 
Nodoka when she found out about the engagement, Nodoka would 
present Ranma to Akane while the two of them &quot;butt-ed out&quot; for a 
week.  He stopped outside a small house with the right address and 
was promptly run over by a girl and a panda throwing water 
balloons at another girl.

Voice:  &quot;Genma!  Ranma!  Ranko!  Stop fooling around.  Soun will 
	be here any time now.&quot;

The three of them stopped moving.  Unfortunately, the panda 
stopped right on top of Soun.  Nodoka stepped out of the house and 
saw the four of them in the street.  She quickly got Genma off the 
unconscious body and attempted to revive him.

Genma:  &quot;Growf&quot;  [Sign:  I thought the road was just bumpy.]

After a minute or so Soun regained consciousness.

Nodoka:  [reintroducing her children]  &quot;This is Ranko,&quot;  [pointing to 
	a young girl with red hair tied in the back with a pigtail, 
	with green eyes] &quot;and this is Ranma.&quot; [indicating a young 
	girl with red hair tied in the back with a pigtail, with blue 
	eyes]

Soun blurted out &quot;Ran... ma?&quot; and fainted again.

***************

Soun woke in the Saotomes&#39; living room.  Nodoka and Ranko were 
applying some smelling salts while Genma looked down at his old 
friend.

Soun:  &quot;Saotome!  Now our families will never be united.  How 
	could you let Ranma have a sex change operation?&quot;
Nodoka: [looking grimly at Genma] &quot;It wasn&#39;t a sex change 
	operation.  My stupid husband,&quot; [Genma flinched] &quot;took 
	them to this place in China and got them all cursed.  They 
	all change forms when they get wet.  Here, I&#39;ll show you.&quot;

Nodoka lined the three up and filled a bucket of water.

Ranma:  &quot;I hate this.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;At least your clothes doesn&#39;t become too small and chokes 
	you.&quot;
Genma:  &quot;Shut up, both of you.&quot;

Nodoka throws the water on the three leaving a red-haired blue-eyed 
girl, a black-haired green-eyed boy, and a panda.

Soun fainted again.

Ranko:  &quot;Gee pop, he sure faints easy for a martial artist.&quot;

***************

Nodoka left the house with Ranma and Ranko behind her.  She 
reminded them (with katana out) that if they came anywhere near 
the house in the next week, she would kill them.  They then 
gathered their things, and the three of them left.

Soun:  &quot;She&#39;s not really serious, is she, Saotome?&quot;
Genma:  &quot;I&#39;m afraid so, Tendo.  I&#39;m afraid so.&quot;

***************

Ranma:  &quot;Mom, you&#39;re not really going to make me marry Akane, 
	are you?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;What&#39;s wrong, Ranma?  Don&#39;t you like her?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;I don&#39;t know, mom!  The last time I saw her was at her 
	mother&#39;s funeral, and that was five years ago!  I don&#39;t think 
	its fair to engage me to someone I don&#39;t even know if I&#39;ll 
	like after all that time.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;I know, Ranma.  When Akane&#39;s mother and I found out 
	that your fathers had made the engagement, we agreed to a 
	compromise.  When the both of you were sixteen, I&#39;d bring 
	you over for a week without either father interfering, and 
	the two of you could decide whether or not to let the 
	engagement stand.  I also think that it wouldn&#39;t do you any 
	harm to at least meet her again.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;I guess.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;And don&#39;t forget, she probably feels the same way about 
	you.&quot;

The three of them walked in silence for awhile.

Ranko:  &quot;Why am I going, mom?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;There are some other things I need to discuss with the 
	both of you and the Tendo sisters.  Besides, if I left you at 
	home those two would probably decide to engage you to 
	either Nabiki or Kasumi.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;What other things?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;I&#39;ll explain when we get there.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Why did we pack out things?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Because even if the engagement is broken off, we&#39;ll be 
	moving in with the Tendos and taking over some of the 
	dojo&#39;s classes.&quot;

***************

Kasumi met the three Saotomes at the front door and showed them 
to what would be their rooms (Nodoka and Genma in one room, 
Ranma and Ranko in another) and told them that Nabiki and Akane 
should be home from school within the hour.  Kasumi started back 
downstairs as Nodoka informed the two that they would be attending 
school from tomorrow.  Her two children groaned.

Nodoka grinned at Kasumi&#39;s descending back, then entered her own 
room and started to unpack her things.

***************

Akane and Nabiki came home and everyone was introduced.  While 
Kasumi started preparing dinner (after refusing Nodoka&#39;s offer to 
help) Nabiki related what had happened during the intervening 
years since the Saotomes&#39; last visit.  Everyone noticed the way 
Ranma and Akane seemed to look at each other appraisingly.

Dinner went by fast and Nodoka explained to Akane that at the end 
of the week, either she or Ranma can break off the engagement if 
they want to.  Kasumi cleared the table and Nodoka said she had 
something important to show Akane.  Ranma looked at his mother 
with eyes that said &quot;Do we have to?&quot;.  Nodoka just nodded &quot;yes&quot; and 
poured a glass of water on his head, changing him to his female 
form.

All three of the Tendos were startled.  Kasumi&#39;s eyes opened wide 
and she said &quot;Oh my!&quot;.  Nabiki leaned closer and poked at Ranma&#39;s 
breasts, making sure they were real.  Akane jumped up and shouted 
that there was no way she was marrying a sex-changing pervert.

Ranma leaped up and shouted back that there was no way he was 
marrying a girl who didn&#39;t even give him a chance and who was 
nowhere near as good looking as his female self and was in fact, 
totally uncute.  Akane got mad, grabbed the table and knocked 
Ranma unconscious underneath it.

Nodoka:  &quot;Ranko, why didn&#39;t you stop Akane?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Because Ranma deserved it.  I think he thought he 
	deserved it, too, otherwise he wouldn&#39;t have gotten caught 
	with such a slow attack.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;What do you mean, slow?&quot;

Akane lifted the table up to squash Ranko, but she had already 
crossed to Akane and slapped her in the face.  Akane dropped the 
table (onto Ranma) and brought a hand to her cheek.

Nodoka:  &quot;Ranko, how can you just slap her?  We&#39;re guests!&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Because she deserved it, too.  She didn&#39;t even give Ranma 
	a chance before she rejected him.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;What do you know?  How would you like to be engaged to 
	some freak who changes sex?&quot;

Ranko sadly looked at her and dumped a glass of water on her own 
head.  Her head hit the roof when Nabiki confirmed her gender 
change.

***************

Ranma and Ranko sat in their room, taking out a change of clothes 
for the bath, both in their cursed forms.  Akane walked past their 
door on the way to her room and noticed it was open a small crack.  
She decided to listen in when she heard her name.

Ranko:  &quot;So what do you think of your Akane?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;That slow, stupid, tomboy?  I don&#39;t know how pops could 
	have engaged me to her.&quot;

Akane started to get mad.

Ranko:  &quot;Then why didn&#39;t you hit her when you two were sparring?&quot;

Akane listened a little more attentively.  It was true that Ranma 
hadn&#39;t hit or even swung at her.  He (or she, whatever) had just 
avoided her attacks and then tapped her on the head.  Ranko had 
certainly shown no such constraint, sweeping her legs out and 
winning their match quickly.

Ranma:  &quot;&#39;Cause... because she&#39;s a girl.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;So?  You swing at me pretty easily.  And remember 
	Shampoo?  You defeated her pretty fast.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;That&#39;s different.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Why?  You were both girls.  Is it because you like Akane?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Hmph!  No way!&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Then why are you blushing?&quot;

Akane quietly left the door and continued on to her room, thinking 
about what she had heard.  Maybe she had been a little unfair to 
Ranma.  It wasn&#39;t his fault that he had fallen into the Spring of 
Drowned Girl.

Ranma:  &quot;Did mom put you up to this?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Of course not.  I&#39;m having all this fun at my own 
	initiative.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Well, stop it.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Make me.&quot;

Nodoka stood off to one side in her room.  She had heard and seen 
everything (including the resulting fight).  Ranko and Ranma soon 
lay on their back, out of breath.

Ranma:  &quot;We really need to fight people we can beat.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;You said it.&quot;

***************

Everyone had finished taking a bath and had gathered in the living 
room at Nodoka&#39;s request.  Nodoka sipped at a cup of tea.

Nodoka:  &quot;Now, you may all know that Ranma and Ranko are the 
	heirs of the Saotome School of Anything-Goes Martial 
	Arts, and that Akane is the heir of the Tendo School of 
	Anything-Goes Martial Arts, but there is another tradition 
	to be passed down.  And now that all five of you are over 
	the age of sixteen, I may reveal it to you.&quot;

All five looked at Nodoka in surprise.  Nodoka pointed at the Tendo 
girls.

Nodoka:  &quot;Your mother and I were the heirs of another ancestral 
	tradition.  Before she died, she asked me to come and see to 
	your training at this point in time.  You are also the heirs of 
	the Saotome and Tendo Schools of &#39;Almost Anything-Goes 
	Marital Arts Lovemaking&#39;.  Now, all of you have certain 
	subconscious self-defense &quot;talents&quot; that must be deactivated 
	before your training can begin.  Now don&#39;t worry.  These 
	abilities were only implanted in the event that a master 
	from a rival school hunted you down and will only activate 
	if a specific stimulus is received and if you&#39;re not attracted 
	to your partner.  I will see to all of you tonight.&quot;

Nodoka took another sip of her tea.

Nodoka:  &quot;Now, I suppose I should explain a little about my school 
	to all of you.  The principal behind Almost Anything-Goes 
	Marital Arts Lovemaking is that two people in love want to 
	and can give their partner and themselves greater physical 
	pleasure because they love each other, and all our 
	techniques are designed to effect that or to protect ourselves 
	from people that we do not love.  Do you have any 
	questions?&quot;

Kasumi:  &quot;Why &#39;Almost Anything-Goes&#39;?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Because while you will learn techniques, whether or not 
	you use them, and with whom, is entirely up to you.  I will 
	not judge you except as it threatens the school.&quot;

Ranko:  &quot;Mom?  About those... things that you&#39;re deactivating?  
	What are they?&quot; 
Nodoka:  &quot;Just because we are a secret school doesn&#39;t mean that we 
	don&#39;t have rival schools that will attempt to destroy us.  To 
	prevent that, we programmed our techniques into your 
	subconscious so that if a master of another school tried to 
	seduce you using an advanced technique, you could counter 
	it and not fall under their spell.  When I deactivate these 
	defenses, it will allow me to teach you to access these 
	techniques voluntarily without them kicking in during the 
	process.&quot;

------------------------------------------------

Episode 1 (Part II)

Akane:  &quot;Auntie, are you saying that we&#39;ll be happy together?&quot; 
	[takes a quick look at Ranma]
Nodoka:  &quot;No, Akane, that is not what I&#39;m saying.  I can&#39;t make you 
	fall in love with my son, and I won&#39;t make you marry if you 
	don&#39;t love him.  But if you do love him, the techniques can 
	help you find greater joy in each other.&quot;

Nabiki:  &quot;What do you mean by &#39;secret school&#39;?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Our art has survived a thousand years only by being 
	passed on through the family line to avoid persecution by 
	others.  You may only tell someone about our school if they 
	swear to secrecy upon penalty of death.  When you marry, 
	and if you change your names, it is further hidden by taking 
	the names of your husband.  That is why it is the Saotome 
	and Tendo schools right now instead of our maiden 
	names.&quot;

Nodoka takes another sip of her tea, noting that everyone else has 
started to drink some.

Nodoka:  &quot;Now, you are all free to decline the offer, but it is a family 
	tradition, and I don&#39;t think that any of you will be hurt by 
	learning these techniques.  And it will make your married 
	life more enjoyable.  However, Ranma and Akane, if they 
	decide to remain engaged and join my school, will have to 
	sleep together by the end of this week.&quot;

Ranma and Akane both jump up, saying that they don&#39;t want to 
sleep together, that they&#39;re not attracted to each other, that they don&#39;t 
even like each other, and that the engagement is off.  Nodoka looked 
at them shrewdly and asked if that was how they really felt.  They 
both affirmed it and then Nodoka whispered something into both 
their ears.

Ranma and Akane started to take off each other&#39;s clothes.  Kasumi, 
Nabiki, and Ranko look surprised at this.  After their clothes had 
fallen to the floor Nodoka whispered again into their ears and they 
stopped, looked embarrassed, and grabbed for their clothes.  They 
demanded to know what Nodoka did to them.

Nodoka smiled and said that all she had done was activate a 
relaxation mode where inhibitions and negative feelings (such as 
fear and anger) would be suppressed.  She said that if there had been 
nothing there, then nothing would have happened between the two 
of them.

Ranma and Akane looked at each other and blushed while they put 
their clothes back on.

Akane still protested, saying that she wasn&#39;t prepared to take the 
chance of becoming pregnant, even if they did decide to remain 
engaged.  Nodoka just smiled at her.

Nodoka:  &quot;Have you been drinking your tea, Akane?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;My... tea?&quot;

Nodoka indicated the bitter tea that they had been drinking.  Their 
mother&#39;s tea that Nodoka had sent them over the years.  They had 
drunk it at first to remember their mother, and had acquired a taste 
for it, though no one who came to their house could stand it.  Nabiki 
looked curious.

Nabiki:  &quot;What about the tea, Auntie?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;It causes the body to release a spermicide into the genitals 
	when sexually excited.&quot;

Ranma suddenly spits out the tea with a shocked look on his face.  
Ranko laughs at his expression.  Nodoka ignores the whole event.

Nodoka:  &quot;Its been a secret of our two schools for five hundred years.  
	It must be drunk at least once a week to be effective.&quot;
Nabiki:  [with a faraway look in her eyes]  &quot;I&#39;m rich.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;No, dear.  It is a secret of our school, so you may sell it 
	only as a folk remedy.  You&#39;ll find that people won&#39;t believe 
	you enough to trust you.  And you must not let scientists get 
	hold of it; the supply is limited because some of the 
	ingredients are rare; if they were to get hold of it our supply 
	would dwindle to nothing.&quot;

Kasumi:  &quot;Oh!  What about father?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;I&#39;ll decide whether to tell your fathers or to keep it a 
	secret from them after all of you tell me whether or not you 
	want to join my school.&quot;

After a moment of silence to indicate that there were no more 
questions, Nodoka dismissed them.

Nodoka:  &quot;Now, I&#39;ll start with Kasumi and finish with Ranko and 
	Ranma.  I&#39;ll meet all of you in your rooms, and I want you 
	to start thinking about what decision you&#39;ll make.&quot;

***************

As Nodoka entered Kasumi&#39;s room, Ranko and Ranma lay back on 
the futons in their room.

Ranma:  &quot;So what do you think?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;It explains a few things.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Oh?  Like what?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Why I can&#39;t remember anything about the times mom took 
	us anywhere by ourselves.&quot;

Ranma tried to remember, but obviously can&#39;t.

Ranma:  &quot;You&#39;re... you&#39;re right!  I can&#39;t remember any of it either.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;She made us forget that we forgot.  And how she and pops 
	would sometimes make love where we could see them, or 
	she&#39;d... you know, do herself.  I think she wanted to show 
	us how wonderful it could be.&quot;

There was a soft knock on the door, then Nabiki and Akane entered 
and sat on the edge of the futons.  Ranma and Ranko sat up.

Akane:  &quot;Ranma...&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;What is it, Akane?&quot;
Akane:  [blushing]  &quot;About tonight...&quot;
Ranma:  [blushing]  &quot;Its OK, Akane, I understand.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;You do?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Its not that I don&#39;t like you, Akane.  Its just that I don&#39;t 
	know if... you know.&quot;

Akane silently nodded.  She could tell that Ranma had been 
thinking what she had.

Nabiki:  &quot;I don&#39;t know what the rest of you are going to do, but I&#39;m 
	going to accept your mother&#39;s offer.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;You are?&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Sure.  Not even money can buy happiness, you know.  
	Well, it can, but why pay for it when you can get it for 
	free?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Nabiki!&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Oh, come on, Akane.  Don&#39;t tell me you haven&#39;t worried 
	about finding a husband that could fulfill you completely.&quot;

Akane blushed again.  So did Ranko.  Ranma hadn&#39;t stopped.

Ranko:  &quot;Well, I think Nabiki&#39;s right.  When I find that special guy I 
	want things to be great.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;I&#39;m going to accept, too.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Ranma!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;What is it, Akane?&quot;
Akane:  [blushing]  &quot;I&#39;m going to accept.  That means we... we&#39;re 
	going to have to...&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;No, it doesn&#39;t.  We can always just break off the 
	engagement.&quot;  [quieter]  &quot;I mean, if you want to...&quot;

Akane looked at Ranma with a strange expression on her face, then 
she and Nabiki left and returned to their rooms to await their turn 
with Nodoka.  Ranko and Ranma returned to staring at the ceiling.

Ranko:  &quot;Way to go, Mr. Smooth.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Shut up.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Make me.&quot;

Nodoka soon popped her head in the door.

Nodoka:  &quot;Are you two fighting again?&quot;
Ranma and Ranko:  &quot;Sorry mom.&quot;

***************

Ranma and Ranko followed Akane and Nabiki to Furinkan High 
School.  About halfway there, they passed a medical clinic where 
Ranma got splashed by some cold water, so Akane went inside to 
ask for some hot water while Nabiki and Ranko went on ahead.  
Inside, they met Dr. Tofu, and Ranma saw the change in Akane&#39;s 
manner as they all stood there in the foyer.

Ranma changed back to his male form, then he and Akane ran for 
Furinkan High before the school day started.  When they got there, a 
crowd of boys started to charge them.  Ranma jumped onto the wall 
and watched as Akane quickly beat up the boys.  He thought to 
himself that she was pretty good, though not as good as Ranko or 
himself.

Nabiki called out to him to get into the building before he was late 
for class, and he saw Ranko beside her watching the fight in the 
courtyard.  Akane finished the fight and Ranma jumped down next 
to her.  At that moment another male student decided to block their 
way and threatened Ranma once he learned that he was staying at 
the dojo.  He called himself &quot;Kuno, the Blue Thunder of Furinkan 
High&quot; and gave a few swings which Ranma dodged.  The girls 
watching the proceedings wondered when Kuno had been given 
such a nickname.

Ranma was about to strike back when he saw a body flying in the air 
toward them.  He smiled and pointed behind Kuno, warning him of 
an attack from behind; Kuno refused to believe him until he saw 
Akane also looking upwards behind him.  He turned, but only saw a 
foot just before it hit him in the face and he was knocked to the 
ground, unconscious.

Ranko:  &quot;Hmph.  &#39;Blue Thunder&#39;?  More like &#39;Blue Blunder&#39;...  Hey 
	Nabiki, throw me my bag, would you?&quot;

Nabiki threw the knapsack down to Ranko as the bell rang for class.  
Ranko, Ranma, and Akane all ran for the classroom, while everyone 
who watched the fight commented on Kuno&#39;s new nickname.

***************

Ranma sat in the classroom thinking about Akane and Dr. Tofu.

Teacher:  &quot;Saotome!&quot;

Ranma was startled by the teacher suddenly sending him out into the 
hall.  A moment later Akane and Ranko joined him.  Akane was 
mad at Ranko.

Akane:  &quot;This is your fault.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Why?  All I said was that he must have been thinking of 
	you.  Weren&#39;t you, Ranma?&quot;
Ranma:  [embarrassed] &quot;Well...&quot;  [Ranma noticed Akane watching 
	him]  &quot;What was that fight about this morning, anyway?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Kuno gave this stupid speech that anyone who wanted to 
	date me had to defeat me in battle.&quot;

Ranma and Ranko sat down on the side of the wall.

Ranma:  &quot;What a jerk!  And everyone actually believes that you&#39;d go 
	out with someone just because he defeated you?&quot;

Ranma and Ranko rolled to opposite sides as a kendo sword plowed 
into the concrete wall between them.

Kuno:  &quot;I will never allow this travesty of engagement between you 
	and Akane Tendo to stand, Saotome!&quot;

The classroom windows burst open behind them filled with students.

Ranma:  &quot;What?  Why not?  I defeated her in battle... so according 
	to your own rules I&#39;m the only one that can ask her out!&quot;
Kuno:  &quot;Never, Saotome!  That rule was only meant to apply to me!&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;It&#39;s none of your business what they do, you jerk.&quot;
Kuno:  &quot;Ah, beauteous one, I do not recognize you...&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Do you recognize this?&quot;

Ranko kicked Kuno in the face and he is knocked back to the wall.

Kuno:  &quot;Oh, you have defeated me!  You are worthy of going out on 
	a date with me!&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;So who wants to go out with you?&quot;
Kuno:  &quot;Oh, pig-tailed goddess... you cannot refuse one who burns 
	with love...&quot;

Ranko remembered the swimming pool she saw from the ledge that 
morning.  She led the insistent Kuno to the window and opened it.

Ranko:  &quot;Perhaps there is something that can prove how I feel for 
	you.  Shall I show it?&quot;
Kuno:  &quot;Of course, of course...&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Farewell, Blue Blunder!&quot;

Ranko kicked Kuno out the window and aimed for the swimming 
pool, but didn&#39;t get it exactly correct as Kuno bounced onto the 
diving board before landing in the pool.

***************    

Ranma and Akane stopped off at Dr. Tofu&#39;s clinic on the way home.  
During a baseball game at school Akane had hit a foul ball directly 
into Ranma&#39;s face.  Ranko had laughed and said that he must have 
been thinking of Akane again because he should never have gotten 
hit.  Ranma had blushed because he had been thinking of Akane; 
Akane blushed at the sudden outburst of giggling from the rest of 
the girls there.

Dr. Tofu was outside sweeping the porch when they passed by; he 
offered to look at Ranma.  As he was looking at Ranma, Kasumi and 
Nodoka walked into the clinic (taking a break from shopping) to 
return a book that Kasumi had borrowed.

Dr. Tofu started acting very strangely and twisted Ranma&#39;s face 
perpendicular to his body.  Everyone reacted differently as Dr. Tofu 
started to speak to Kasumi.  Ranma was in shock; Akane and Ranko 
looked at him with disbelief in their eyes; Kasumi looked at Ranma 
and asked if he was all right, then gave Dr. Tofu the book and some 
cookies, of which Dr. Tofu started to eat the plate.

Nodoka just thought to herself &#39;The Love Hysteria&#39; and sighed.  She 
noticed that Kasumi seemed not to notice the effect she had, and that 
Akane seemed upset.  Ranma definitely seemed upset, but that was 
to be expected.

Dr. Tofu fixed the complaining Ranma by turning his head so that it 
leaned the other way.  Akane left the building, and Ranma followed 
her.  Nodoka sighed again and led Kasumi and Ranko back to the 
dojo.

***************

Akane went to the river to think.  Ranma came up behind her and 
she pounded his head into the ground when she discovered his 
presence, and inadvertently cured him.  Ranma thanked her.

Akane noticed that he seemed nervous.  But he blurted out one 
phrase and left her alone as he went back to the dojo.

Ranma:  &quot;Akane, if you want to call off the engagement, I&#39;ll 
	understand.&quot;

***************

Akane laid back on her bed.  She didn&#39;t want to admit it, but she 
believed she was in love with Ranma.  It wasn&#39;t just that he had been 
kind to her at her mother&#39;s funeral; or that she remembered happy 
times with him when they both were children; or that she found him 
attractive; or that he had a sense of honor she could respect; or even 
that she thought he was attracted to her.  It was because he actually 
seemed to care about what she felt.

She had a crush on Dr. Tofu for the longest time now, but she 
couldn&#39;t admit to herself that he was totally in love with Kasumi.  
Until today.  As she fell asleep she was surprised to find herself 
dreaming of Ranma.

***************

Ranma laid down on his futon, trying to sort out his thoughts.  He 
didn&#39;t want to admit it, but he believed he was in love with Akane.  
When she was near he wanted to hold her in his arms; he just 
wished he could be sure he knew how she felt about him.   And then 
there was Dr. Tofu, whom he thought she was in love with.

He had never really thought about a girlfriend.  The constant travels 
with either of his parents stopped him from meeting a lot of girls, 
and those he did meet... well, he had to admit to himself, just didn&#39;t 
interest him because they were so... passive.  But Akane was 
different.  She was her own person, no matter what anyone else said 
or did.  And she was interested in martial arts, just like he was.  And 
she was attractive.

Ranko walked into the room and laid down exhausted on her futon.  
Ranma turned onto his side to look at her.

Ranma:  &quot;Ranko?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;What?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Do you think Akane likes me?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I think so... but why don&#39;t you just ask her?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;I can&#39;t...&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Ranma, one of you is going to have to make the first move.  
	It might as well be you.&quot;  [Ranma returned to laying on his 
	back]  &quot;And I wish you&#39;d hurry up.  I&#39;m exhausted.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Why?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Mom&#39;s started her Marital Arts training today.  Since she 
	doesn&#39;t want to interfere with the two of you before you 
	make a decision, she&#39;s using me as the male in my cursed 
	form.  Stupid shiatsu technique.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;What technique?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Shiatsu Erection Spot.  She had Kasumi and Nabiki poking 
	me until they got it right.&quot;

***************

Nabiki stood over a dejected Kuno, who had once again proven that 
mindless persistence tended to fail.  Everyone had given up on 
Akane except him.  And he would waffle between her and Ranko (or 
Ranma when the conditions were right) incessantly.  She could turn 
that to her advantage.

She plopped down five photographs of Akane doing her martial arts 
workout.  He willingly paid the 3000 yen she asked for; she then 
&quot;accidentally&quot; dropped a pack of five more photos on the floor.  
When he picked them up his eyes widened; the pictures of Ranko 
and Ranma in female form were more risque than the previous 
batch, showing a just a hint of cleavage.

Cheap photos, really.  Taken with a small hand-held camera and 
processed at the local five-hour store, but good enough to relieve 
Tatewaki Kuno of his money.  She charged Kuno a thousand yen 
more than the previous pack and he willingly paid it all.  She 
shivered at the thought of what she could get for some posed 
&quot;accidental&quot; shots of Ranko with her good camera, but if she did that 
she would have to cut her in on the action.

She casually tossed out the prospect of photos of Kuno&#39;s &quot;pig-tailed 
twins&quot; and he almost went insane at the thought, declaring that he 
was the only one worthy of Akane Tendo, Ranko Saotome, and her 
shy identical twin sister.  Nabiki inwardly laughed to herself at the 
prospect of eventually convincing Kuno of the existence of the 
&quot;Saotome Quintuplet&quot; - Ranma and two pairs of identical twin 
sisters, one pair with blue and one pair with green eyes.  All she 
needed was some colored contacts and some time in the school 
darkroom.

***************

Akane found herself thinking about the situation the whole day at 
school, so she finally steeled herself and got the tools from the 
closet.  Kasumi stood in the kitchen cleaning up after dinner like she 
always did at this time of day.  She was startled when Akane entered 
the room with a pair of scissors and a comb.

Akane:  &quot;Kasumi, could you cut my hair?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Oh Akane.  Are you sure you want to?  You&#39;ve grown it 
	for so long now.&quot;
Akane:  [sighing]  &quot;It doesn&#39;t seem that important anymore.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;OK, if that&#39;s what you want.&quot;

Kasumi led Akane to the dojo, where she set up a chair and a sheet 
to catch all the cut hair.  Akane sat down as Kasumi covered her 
body with another sheet and pinned it together at the back of the 
neck.  Kasumi stopped as she was about to start cutting.

Kasumi:  &quot;Last chance, Akane.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Go on, Kasumi.&quot;

Kasumi started to cut Akane&#39;s hair.

Kasumi:  &quot;So why are you doing this, Akane?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;I just felt that it was time for a change, that&#39;s all.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;So why are you doing this, really?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;I only grew it long to impress this guy.  But he&#39;s in love 
	with someone else, so there&#39;s no chance for me.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;And Ranma doesn&#39;t fit into this picture at all?&quot;
Akane:  [blushing]  &quot;Maybe.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;So are you going to keep the engagement?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;I don&#39;t know... I mean, I don&#39;t know how he feels about it.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Did you talk to him about it?&quot;

Kasumi quickly finished cutting Akane&#39;s hair with the skill of a 
hairstylist while the both of them remained silent.  Kasumi started to 
clean up the dojo.

Kasumi:  &quot;And who did you have this crush on?&quot;
Akane:  [blushing again]  &quot;I&#39;d rather not say.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Come on, you can tell your older sister.&quot;
Akane:  [after awhile]  &quot;It was Dr. Tofu.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;So Dr. Tofu&#39;s in love?  How sweet!  Who&#39;s he in love 
	with?  Do I know her?&quot;
Akane:  [nodding]
Kasumi:  &quot;So who is it, tell me.&quot;
Akane:  [struggling to get the words out, but spurred by the years of 
	emotion]  &quot;Its you.&quot;

Kasumi dropped everything onto the floor.

***************

Akane knocked on the door to Ranma and Ranko&#39;s room.  Ranma 
answered and she walked in.  He stared at her.

Ranma:  &quot;What did you do to your hair?&quot;

Akane ran her hand through her hair now cut short, then shook her 
head to let it bounce.

Akane:  &quot;I thought that maybe it was time for a change.  Do you like 
	it?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Um... well... it sure makes you look... different.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;That&#39;s not an answer, Ranma.&quot;

Akane moved her body near his.  Ranma was filled with the scent of 
her hair, and when she placed a hand on his chest, he couldn&#39;t help 
but slip an arm around her waist.  He expected her to move away, or 
to slap him, but she moved in to embrace him.  She had avoided him 
the whole day, but now it seemed...

Ranma:  &quot;Akane, does this mean...&quot;
Akane:  [nodding]  &quot;I want us to remain engaged, Ranma.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Even though...&quot;
Akane:  &quot;I&#39;m not ready for it tonight, OK?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;I&#39;ll wait until you&#39;re ready.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Ranma?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;What is it, Akane?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Do you love me?&quot;
Ranma:  [suddenly nervous]  &quot;Um... well... err...&quot;  [steeling himself]  
	&quot;I do love you.&quot;

Akane suddenly placed her hands around Ranma&#39;s neck and pulled 
his face down for a kiss.  They didn&#39;t let go for a long time.

***************

Kasumi entered her room after lunch, hot and bothered.  Her mind 
kept returning to what Akane had told her the day before, that Dr. 
Tofu was in love with her.  She didn&#39;t know whether or not it was 
true.  She hadn&#39;t seen anything that made her believe that, and Dr. 
Tofu hadn&#39;t said anything about it to her.  So she just didn&#39;t know.  
But it was true that she had dreamt that morning that Dr. Tofu had 
entered her room to conduct an examination and had ended up 
making love to her.

She had never thought of him that way before.  She hadn&#39;t been 
worried that she would find someone special, but at times it seemed 
to her that she had trapped herself in the dojo; all her friends from 
school had gone on to college or to start families.  She had to admit 
that he was attractive, and he was also older than her (she had found 
that younger men bored her).

Kasumi had woken up with her fingers caressing her womanhood at 
the vividness of the dream.  Kasumi had taken out Nodoka&#39;s &quot;gift&quot; 
then, and did something she had never done before; she lost her self-
control of her actions and plunged the vibrator in and out of her 
body with abandon until she had attained her release.  She was 
ashamed at her loss of control, of course, but the dream had seemed 
so real and her need had been so overwhelming.  Luckily everyone 
had still been asleep.

She had gone shopping that morning, and had passed by the clinic.  
She almost went in, but the fear that Akane was wrong consumed 
her; she only stopped to spy into a window.  She saw him working 
then, treating a patient with unconscious grace, his muscles moving 
underneath his gi.  She quickly turned away as she remembered the 
morning&#39;s dream, hoping to forget it as she rushed home and busied 
herself in preparing lunch for herself and Nodoka.  But it hadn&#39;t 
worked.

------------------------------------------------

Episode 1 - Part 3

All Kasumi could think about was Dr. Tofu.  It was ridiculous!  She 
didn&#39;t even know his full name!  But now that Akane had raised the 
possibility it was all she could think about.  He was all she could 
think about.  She needed to find release again, but she couldn&#39;t face 
him right now and ask him to make love to her.  She just couldn&#39;t.  
It just wasn&#39;t anything a nice girl did.

She reached under her mattress and pulled out Nodoka&#39;s graduation 
gift to her, holding it to her face and turning it on for a second or 
two.  Kasumi reached around and removed the dress from her body, 
letting it fall to the floor.  She undid her bra and slipped out of her 
panties, making her way onto the bed.  She felt at her womanhood.  
It was already damp.

She rolled over on the bed, letting the sheets caress her body, 
wishing that it was Dr. Tofu.  She rolled over onto the vibrator and 
let herself smile.  When Auntie Nodoka had sent it to her, she had 
been shocked and had quickly hidden it away, but the boredom of 
being the housekeeper (and the curiosity) had eventually driven her 
to use it on herself.  Now she simply called it &#39;Mr. Wonderful&#39; 
because it made her feel so wonderful.

Kasumi ran a finger over her engraved name.  The dream that 
morning had been so exciting that she was determined to experience 
it again.  She frowned as she struggled to remember exactly how it 
went.

She had woken up feeling a little sick, and father had called for Dr. 
Tofu to examine her.  She had been dressed in one of her 
nightgowns, and Dr. Tofu chased everyone else out for the sake of 
privacy.  He then took out a stethoscope while she let the nightgown 
slip from her shoulders.  He pressed the stethoscope to her chest, the 
coldness (and the excitement, she had to admit) causing her nipples 
to stiffen and protrude from her chest.  She was embarrassed, but 
didn&#39;t think Dr. Tofu had even noticed, until she saw the bulge in 
his pants.

Kasumi pinched and pulled at her nipples so that they were just like 
they were in her dream.  She had then grabbed at his manhood, 
stroking it through his pants.  He had protested, saying that it was 
unethical that they should be doing this, but she had ignored him 
and slipped his pants down past his jutting manhood.  She had 
stroked it for awhile, then moved closer to kiss it, to engulf it in her 
mouth the same way that she was doing right now to the vibrator.  
Kasumi brought the vibrator down to her womanhood and turned it 
on as she ran it across her body, finally inserting it into herself.  Not 
too deep at first, but letting it run over her insides, building up the 
pleasure slowly.  But that was not the way it had happened in the 
dream.

She had suddenly found that she and Dr. Tofu were naked, and that 
he was laying atop her, ready to enter her with a wonderful lustful 
look to his eyes.  She remembered being a little scared of him then, 
but more excited than anything else.  With a swift lunge he had 
buried himself in her; she performed the same feat with her vibrator 
when she was wet enough, gasping at being filled so quickly.  She 
moaned out the words &quot;Yes, Dr. Tofu.&quot; as she started to move the 
vibrator in and out of herself and brought her free hand to caress her 
clitoris.

He had brought her to release quickly with his masterful 
lovemaking, but had not stopped there.  He continued to drive 
himself into her willing body, eventually moaning out the words &quot;I 
love you, Kasumi.&quot;.  That was all she heard from that moment on.  
He lifted her out of the bed, then walked past her father as they 
continued to make love, each step bringing their bodies together.  
She had suddenly been dressed in a wedding kimono and still Dr. 
Tofu took possession of her body and soul, the words &quot;I love you, 
Kasumi&quot; echoing endlessly through her thoughts.  On the bed, 
Kasumi could feel herself rapidly reaching her own point of release; 
her free hand stopped its work and flew to the pillow above her 
head, quickly bringing it to cover her face as the orgasm overtook 
her body and she yelled out &quot;Dr. Tofu&quot;, hoping that Nodoka had 
been too far away to hear.

Kasumi brought the vibrator up to her face and kissed it, renaming it 
&#39;Dr. Tofu&#39; and held it next to her face and lay back on the bed, 
exhausted but determined to see the real Dr. Tofu that afternoon.  
She cleaned &#39;Dr. Tofu&#39; of her juices and replaced it in its hiding 
place under her mattress.  She laid back on the bed, recovering from 
the wonderful experience that had enveloped her, and soon fell 
asleep.  When she woke up again it was already time to start on 
dinner.

***************

Nodoka sat in her room and looked at the two children in front of 
her.  She could tell that they were scared, but they were holding 
hands; a good sign.

Ranma:  &quot;Mom, could we talk for a minute?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;You still have a couple of days before you have to make 
	the decision, Ranma.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;We know, but we&#39;re ready now.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;So do you want to remain engaged?  Ranma?&quot;

Ranma looked at Akane, then down at the floor.

Ranma:  &quot;I don&#39;t mind... if Akane doesn&#39;t.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Akane?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;I don&#39;t mind.&quot;
Nodoka:  [After some silence]  &quot;Well, are you two ready?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Do we have to, mom?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Why, Ranma?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Well, it just seems like we&#39;re... rushing things.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;I know, Ranma, but it is necessary.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Why is that, Auntie?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Because you two have to decide whether or not you want 
	to remain exclusive to each other, and this pledge must be 
	sealed by the act of making love.  Almost all practitioners 
	of our art will respect a pledge of exclusiveness, and its 
	hard enough to build a relationship in any case.&quot; [Nodoka 
	smiles to herself]  &quot;Besides, I know that if I didn&#39;t do 
	anything, nothing would happen between the two of you.  
	And some of the techniques I will teach could be used 
	against you and can destroy your relationship, especially if 
	either of you are the jealous type.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Oh, come on.&quot;

Nodoka poked a spot on Ranma&#39;s body.  He immediately fell on his 
back as he attempted to relieve the strain of his suddenly erect 
manhood against his pants.  He remembered hearing about this 
technique from Ranko, but he hadn&#39;t really believed it would really 
work.  Akane looked wide-eyed at Ranma, speechless, as he slowly 
lost his erection.

Nodoka:  &quot;Shiatsu Erection Spot.  And I could kept it up and have a 
	quite pleasurable liaison with him.  How would you react if 
	you had walked in on that, Akane?&quot;

Akane looked at Ranma, almost stumbling on her words.

Nodoka:  &quot;If you don&#39;t pledge the vow, then I will feel free to use 
	Ranma in all my training exercises, which would make it 
	easier in training everyone than if I didn&#39;t use him.&quot;
Akane:  [blushing]  &quot;Well... I don&#39;t mind... making such a pledge.&quot;

Ranma looked at Akane with wide eyes and took her hand in his 
own.  He wanted to kiss her, but was suddenly afraid to. 

Ranma:  &quot;I... don&#39;t mind either.&quot;

Akane looked right back into Ranma&#39;s eyes, losing herself into them.  
She shook her head, as if to clear it, and brought her lips next to his.  
Ranma responded in kind, a little embarrassed at doing it in front of 
his mother.

Ranma:  &quot;Mom, would you... you know?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Do you want this too, Akane?&quot;

Akane just nodded her head, a little scared at what she knew was 
going to occur next.  Nodoka smiled at the two of them and 
whispered into their ears.  Ranma and Akane relaxed and started to 
undress each other, like they did the first night they met.  Nodoka 
guided them out the door as Ranma carried Akane to her room in 
his arms.

***************

Ranma entered Akane&#39;s room carrying her in his arms.  He shut the 
door behind him.  It didn&#39;t close all the way, but they didn&#39;t care.

Ranma gently lowered Akane so that she stood in front of him and 
they looked into each other&#39;s eyes.  As Ranma kissed her lips, he 
also raised his hands to Akane&#39;s breasts and Akane ran her own over 
his chest.  Akane shuddered when Ranma ran his hands over her 
nipples and back down her stomach, her hips, then down her legs.

Nodoka pressed a button on a small pad that she carried to start the 
camera she had placed in the room, then placed their clothes in a 
corner and closed the door, but neither of them noticed.  Ranma was 
too busy guiding Akane to the bed.  Akane was too busy kissing 
Ranma&#39;s neck.  Nodoka smiled to herself; they had been so scared of 
the night before them that they forgot to make the pledge.

Akane sat on the edge of the bed while Ranma kneeled in front of 
her.  Bringing his hands back to her breasts, he slowly traced a 
finger around the nipples, stiffening them under his touch.  Akane 
gasped when he pinched and pulled lightly; she gave a small cry 
when he brought his lips to them.  She ran her hands through his 
hair and held his face to her body.

Ranma nursed at her breasts for awhile, then pushed Akane so that 
she lay on her back.  Ranma left her breasts by kissing his way down 
the valley between them and down her torso.  Akane looked shocked 
as he approached her womanhood.

&quot;Ranma!&quot;  She exclaimed wide-eyed.  But her protest went 
unheeded and was dropped when Ranma started to rain kisses on 
her inner thighs and finally across her junction.  Ranma positioned 
himself so that his head lay between her thighs and grabbed her 
torso with his arms, effectively immobilizing it in his grasp.  Still, 
Akane&#39;s body jumped off the bed when Ranma ran his tongue along 
her slit.

Ranma started to work Akane with his fingers, gently opening her to 
his explorations.

Ranma remembered when he first got cursed; he had wondered as to 
what it was like for a woman.  He had seen both his mother and 
sister masturbate at times - his family was never shy about such 
things.  So he copied as best he could what he saw them do and 
shakingly brought himself to relief in his cursed form.  He had been 
ashamed at the time.

Now Ranma was glad he had been cursed.  He knew exactly what it 
felt like to have a finger run along the edge of a woman&#39;s inner lips, 
what caused Akane to moan in pleasure when he lightly brushed 
across her clitoris.  He knew how close Akane was to cumming by 
the way she wrapped her legs around his head and attempted to 
bring him closer.

He avoided her hymen; that he would take only when she was ready.  
But his fingers continued his assault and soon Akane arched her 
back and attempted to buck her hips from his grasp.  Her body fell 
back onto the bed, but he refused to let up the assault.  Ranma 
extended his tongue and licked every drop of Akane&#39;s released 
nectar from her body, savoring its taste as his own.

Akane quickly felt the fire that had just blazed across her body 
building up in force again.  Ranma&#39;s tongue seemed intent on 
exploring every inch of her womanhood, copying the route that his 
fingers took just moments before.  Akane squirmed on the bed and 
the sheets clung to her sweaty body, and then Ranma slowly circled 
his tongue on her clitoris and she again lost control of herself, 
drenching his face as she moaned out his name.

Despite the tiredness she felt, Akane knew it was time for Ranma to 
enter her.  She wanted him to enter her.  If Nodoka hadn&#39;t made her 
so... serene, she supposed she would have been scared of what was 
about to happen.  But she wasn&#39;t.  She pulled herself up so that she 
was sitting in front of Ranma, then gently put a hand on his face and 
brought him level with her.  She gazed into his eyes and found 
herself starting to lose herself in them again; she shook off the 
feeling and saw his face covered in her juices.

She had a sudden urge and tasted herself for the first time and she 
spread kisses across his face.  Akane broke off the kisses and looked 
down at Ranma&#39;s erect manhood between them.  She grasped it in 
her hand and slowly guided it into herself.  She gasped as it slowly 
entered her, then suddenly it could go no further.

Akane looked up into Ranma&#39;s eyes then and saw how he was 
looking at her.  Akane gave him a quick peck on the cheek and gave 
a small cry when he suddenly lunged forward and took her virginity.  
He was buried fully within her, but he had not moved any more 
when she cried out.  Still fully joined, he pulled back his face from 
hers and saw two tears start to fall; he kissed them away.

The pain passed, and the realization that he still filled her started to 
assert itself.  Akane wrapped her legs around his body and Ranma 
withdrew himself, only to lunge forward again.  With each new 
stroke Akane quickly forgot about the pain and started to lose herself 
in the pleasure.

Akane fell back onto the bed and Ranma followed her, never letting 
the rhythm of their joining falter.  He raised himself onto his arms 
and closed his eyes as he continued his movements.  Akane opened 
her eyes when she felt a drop of sweat fall from his face onto her 
body.  She wrapped her arms around his neck and closed her eyes 
again, savoring the feeling of every stroke.

Ranma struggled to maintain control of himself as he moved within 
Akane.  Her tightness and wetness engulfed his manhood and every 
push threatened to make him explode.  He wanted to wait until 
Akane was ready, but he knew he couldn&#39;t last much longer.  So he 
did the only thing he could.  He sped up.

Akane didn&#39;t know how much longer she could go.  Every moment 
threatened to take her over the brink she had climbed twice before.  
Her whole world seemed to concentrate on her womanhood as 
Ranma thrust into her again and again; the friction between them 
building a fire that was going to engulf her.  And she wanted it to 
engulf her, to tear her senses away and make her lose herself in him 
as she almost did when she gazed into his eyes.

Suddenly he sped up and she cried out as waves of pleasure swept 
across her body, radiating from the junction between them.  She felt 
herself release her nectar onto his manhood; she felt his hot seed 
splash within her as he too lost control and cried out.

Ranma and Akane collapsed on the bed in exhaustion; he remained 
buried within her as they lay together, letting the sweat dry off their 
bodies as they held each other in their arms.

***************

Ranma lay atop of Akane&#39;s body, his face nestled against her breast.  
She placed an arm on his back, holding him in an embrace while the 
other hand idly played with his hair.  They lay there in silence for 
awhile, just reveling in the other&#39;s nearness; their scent and touch 
reassuring each other that it really had happened.

Akane:  &quot;Was that really your first time, Ranma?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;It was.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;How did you know... you know.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Oh... you&#39;re going to think I&#39;m a pervert.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;I won&#39;t.  I promise.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Well, my parents aren&#39;t very private sometimes.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Ranma!  You spy on your parents?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;I don&#39;t know if you can call the kitchen &#39;spying&#39;.&quot;

Akane blushed.  Ranma didn&#39;t notice.

Ranma:  &quot;And my other form... well, I was curious...&quot;
Akane:  &quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot;

Akane&#39;s hand started to twirl designs on Ranma&#39;s back after a 
moment of silence between them.

Akane:  &quot;Ranma, do you really think I&#39;m uncute?&quot;

Ranma lifted himself onto his arms and looked down at her, then 
turned his head to the side.

Ranma:  &quot;Hmph.  Of course you&#39;re uncute.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Ranma, don&#39;t lie.  The proof is right here.&quot;

Akane reached down and grabbed his once-again stiffened manhood 
in her hand.  Her free hand turned Ranma&#39;s face back around to see 
her smiling face.  She suddenly rolled them both over and kissed 
him, then started to straddle his torso.

Akane:  &quot;Do you want to do it again?&quot;

Ranma just smiled and lifted his hands to her breasts as she started 
to impale herself onto him.

Marital Arts
Episode 1 - Part 4

Nodoka quietly opened the door to Akane&#39;s room and smiled at the 
two sleeping lovers.  Akane had snuggled against Ranma during the 
night and Ranma had placed his arm around her in a familiar 
embrace.  Nodoka clicked off the light (they had not bothered to turn 
it off) and gently shook them awake.  Both of them woke with a 
start, blushing and trying to pull the blankets around their bodies 
while simultaneously sitting up.  Nodoka smiled and kissed the two 
of them on their heads as she left some bathrobes on the bed.

Nodoka:  &quot;I&#39;ve prepared the bath, so the two of you go wash 
	yourselves off.  Breakfast will be ready soon.&quot;

Nodoka left the room and headed to the kitchen.  Ranma slipped an 
arm around Akane&#39;s waist and they both fell back onto the bed.  
Akane reluctantly pushed herself onto her arms and looked down at 
Ranma.

Akane:  &quot;Your mother&#39;s right, Ranma.  There&#39;s no way we can 
	continue the day like this.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Why get up at all?&quot;

Ranma lightly ran a hand down the side of Akane&#39;s body, but after a 
quick kiss allowed her to lift herself out of bed.  Akane blushed 
when she saw Ranma&#39;s body as he pulled on his bathrobe, 
remembering the pleasure they had found in each other the night 
before, then looked up at his eyes and smiling face.  He reached out 
his hand; Akane took it in her own and they made their way to the 
bath.

***************

Akane and Ranma rinsed themselves off with cold water and 
prepared to lather each other up.  They started to trace soapy paths 
across each other (with Akane now having the added difference of 
Ranma&#39;s female body).  Still, their ministrations were sometimes a 
hard scrub and sometimes a lingering caress, but neither protested 
either.

Both seemed almost oblivious to where their hands were moving.  
The washtowels approached the triangles of the other&#39;s sex, both of 
them moaned with passion as they traveled across it, gasping when 
they both used their finger to separate the outer lips.  With their free 
hands they touched each other&#39;s face and brought their lips close.

As they kissed, Akane rinsed the soap off by pouring a bucketful of 
cold water on them.  She started to kiss her way down Ranma&#39;s 
front.  She took a nipple into her mouth and started to suck on it.  
Ranma looked down while holding the back of Akane&#39;s head.

Ranma:  &quot;Akane, you don&#39;t have to, I mean...&quot;

Akane looked up with a mischievous gleam in her eyes, 
remembering how she had reacted when Ranma traced the same 
path with her the night before.  She returned to kiss Ranma on the 
lips, then lay his now female body onto the wet bathroom tiles.  Like 
he did last night, she kissed a path down past the stomach into the 
red hair, which tickled her nose.

Remembering how she had reacted, Akane gently opened the outer 
lips for further exploration and found that Ranma&#39;s form had no 
hymen.  Akane didn&#39;t stop to wonder about it as she used her fingers 
and tongue as best she could; it was the first time she had done this.  
Ranma certainly wasn&#39;t complaining as his torso kept twisting in her 
grasp and his ass kept splashing water as it repeatedly impacted the 
floor.  In spite of the physical evidence to the contrary, she still 
considered Ranma a man - a man she wanted to give pleasure to.

Ranma&#39;s body stiffened in her grasp as Ranma gasped.  Ranma&#39;s 
womanhood let forth a gush of honey that Akane eagerly lapped up 
with her tongue; she felt the constriction of Ranma&#39;s inner muscles 
around her penetrating fingers.  When the spasms had passed, 
Akane kissed her way back up Ranma&#39;s body.

As she reached Ranma&#39;s head he grabbed her in a hug and kissed 
her.  Akane pushed herself away from Ranma.

Akane:  &quot;I&#39;m going to make sure the door is locked... and when I get 
	back you better be a man!&quot;

Ranma smiled at her and watched her leave the room.  He quickly 
dumped a bucket of hot water and changed back to his male form, 
hungrily reaching out for her when she returned, but she was 
quickly followed by Nodoka, Kasumi, Nabiki, and Ranko.

Akane:  [whispering and blushing]  &quot;They were watching us.&quot;

Nodoka smiled at everyone&#39;s embarrassment.

Nodoka:  &quot;When I planned for us to take a bath together, this is not 
	exactly what I had in mind.&quot;

Nodoka tried to look stern, but failed.

***************

Ranma and Akane sat in the bath while the others washed 
themselves.  Ranma tried to keep his eyes off of everyone else&#39;s 
bodies by keeping his attention on Akane, which mostly worked.  
Nodoka sighed to herself when she lowered her body into the hot 
water.

Nodoka:  &quot;I&#39;ve decided that it would be best if your fathers didn&#39;t 
	find out about our school.  I&#39;m not sure that they&#39;d entirely 
	understand.  So when they come back tomorrow, we&#39;ll go 
	on our own &#39;training trip&#39; for a month or so, and you should 
	have gotten most of the techniques by then.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Where will we go, mom?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Back to our house.  That should be good enough.&quot;

Akane looked back and forth between Ranma and Ranko.

Akane:  &quot;Ranma, if you both fell into opposite pools, why didn&#39;t you 
	cure yourselves by jumping into the pool that the other fell 
	in?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;We tried.  But the guide said that only one curse from a 
	pool is permanent at a time.  One of us would have to die 
	before the other can be cured.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Does that mean that anyone else who&#39;s cursed is going to 
	come after you?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;I doubt it, not everyone is as stupid as pops.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Now, Ranma... don&#39;t go insulting your father like that.  
	Even if he does deserve it in this case for taking you to 
	China without speaking Chinese.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Sorry, mom.&quot;

***************

Akane and Ranma went upstairs to get dressed and returned to join 
everyone at the breakfast table.  Akane could tell everyone wanted to 
ask her about the night before, but they kept quiet for the time being.

Nodoka:  &quot;Are you ready to make the pledge?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;I&#39;m ready.&quot;

Ranma looked at Akane as she hesitated.  Akane could feel the eyes 
of everyone else on her.  Especially Ranko, who seemed to 
wordlessly implore her not to make the pledge.

Akane:  &quot;I... I can&#39;t.&quot;

Ranma looked at Akane in disbelief.  

Ranma:  &quot;What?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Ranma... I...&quot;

Ranma stood up and started to walk out of the room.

Nodoka:  &quot;Ranma!  Where are you going?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Out.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Ranma!  Sit back down!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;No!&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Oh, what about breakfast?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;I&#39;m not hungry.&quot;

Ranma left the room and everyone could hear him heading upstairs.  
Nodoka sighed.  She knew how Ranma was feeling, so she didn&#39;t 
take offense at his tone or actions.  When Ranma had thought things 
through, he would be back to his normal self and apologize; she had 
raised him too well for him not to reach that point eventually.

Akane got up and followed Ranma upstairs, softly calling his name.

***************

Shampoo followed Ryoga as they walked off the ship.  Since there 
was only one way to move she figured it was safe to follow him for 
the time being.  She wondered if it had been a mistake to join up 
with him; but her japanese wasn&#39;t yet good enough to get by on her 
own.

The boy was obviously retarded or something.  Despite the obvious 
physical attributes, the boy insisted that Ranma was a boy and 
Ranko was a girl.  Shampoo didn&#39;t much care.  Ranma was 
obviously a girl and she would have her revenge, then return to the 
village with her honor restored.  He could fight Ranko if he wanted 
to.

A small rain shower passed over them and the boy immediately took 
out his umbrella.  Another strike against him for even being 
bothered by such a trifle.  Her Great-Grandmother had told her to 
take a good look at both this boy and Ranko as potential husband 
material.  If both Ryoga and Ranko were as good as Ranma then 
they should be able to beat her in combat.  Shampoo shuddered 
angrily at the thought that anyone was better than her, but she was 
also excited that she might actually get a strong husband instead of 
one of the weaklings around the village.

Shampoo watched as Ryoga asked a passerby for the way to 
Furinkan High School.  The man pointed to the east and said 
&quot;Tokyo&quot;.  Ryoga started to run westward, but Shampoo threw one of 
her bonbori at his head, knocking him out cold.

Shampoo sighed and asked herself again if she would be better off 
without him.

***************

Akane continued to softly call out Ranma&#39;s name as she climbed the 
stairs.  She checked in her room but Ranma wasn&#39;t there.  She went 
to the room that he shared with Ranko and opened the door.  He was 
lying on his futon, his back to her.

Akane:  &quot;Ranma?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Go away, Akane.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;No.  You&#39;re my fiancee.&quot;

Akane entered the room and slipped under the covers behind 
Ranma.  He refused to look at her.  She slipped an arm over  his 
body in a loose embrace.  They lay in silence for awhile, then 
Ranma covered her hand with his own.

Akane:  &quot;Ranma... you are the only man for me.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Then why wouldn&#39;t you...&quot;
Akane:  &quot;I can&#39;t be the only woman for you.  Not yet.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;That&#39;s bullshit.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Its not...&quot;

They both fell silent again.

Akane:  &quot;Our sisters...&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Mom said she didn&#39;t need me.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Its not the same, Ranma.  What I felt last night...&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;That was between us.&quot;

Akane crawled over Ranma&#39;s body.  He fell onto his back and she 
lay on top of him, her arms lifting her body up so that her face 
hovered above Ranma&#39;s.

Akane:  &quot;That&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about.  Its just... you licking the 
	sweat off my body, or...&quot;

Akane lowered herself to whisper in Ranma&#39;s ear.

Akane:  &quot;You inside me... nothing can replace that...&quot;

Akane&#39;s scent and the contact of their bodies caused his erection to 
grow.  Akane smiled as she felt the bulge in Ranma&#39;s pants.  She 
kissed Ranma, then sat up on his torso.

Akane:  &quot;I love you, Ranma Saotome.  And weren&#39;t we interrupted 
	this morning?&quot;

Akane lifted the sweater off her body and threw it on the side, 
exposing her now naked top.  Ranma pulled his chinese shirt off.

Ranma:  &quot;I don&#39;t love them.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;I know...&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;You don&#39;t love us?&quot;

Ranma and Akane pulled the blanket up around them as they looked 
at the door.  Ranko was framed in the doorway, holding a tray of 
food.

Ranko:  &quot;I volunteered to bring this up.  Mom and the others are 
	watching a videotape of the two of you from last night and 
	evaluating your performance.&quot;

Ranma and Akane blush.  Ranko sets the tray to one side when they 
make no movement for it.  She lifted the chinese shirt off her body.  
Ranma and Akane look at her wide-eyed.

Ranko:  &quot;I watched the two of you last night while hanging upside-
	down outside the window.  I have to admit I was a little 
	jealous.  When I saw Akane making love to my body this 
	morning I understood.&quot;

Ranko slipped under the covers and pressed close to the other two.  
With one hand she touched Ranma&#39;s arm, the other she ran across 
Akane&#39;s bare back.

Ranko:  &quot;I mean, I thought it was just me.  I came back to this room 
	and... you know.  I saw myself making love to both of you 
	when I closed my eyes.  I thought I was a pervert or 
	something, no matter what mom had said.&quot;

Ranko&#39;s hand reached and cupped Akane&#39;s breast from across her 
body.  Her other hand had taken Ranma&#39;s and placed it on her own 
breast.  She looked at the two of them with a slightly scared 
expression that Ranma had never seen on her face before.

Ranko:  &quot;I thought I&#39;d beat Nabiki and Kasumi here.  Just ask me to 
	leave and I will.&quot;

Ranko slowly moved her head closer so that her lips were next to 
Ranma&#39;s.  Then she was suddenly kissing her brother for the first 
time.  She broke off the kiss and smiled as she felt Akane&#39;s hand run 
across her bare back, then moving her head closer to Akane, who 
also accepted her kiss.  All three were surprised at how natural it 
seemed.

The three of them rolled over so that Ranko lay with her back on the 
floor.  Ranko gasped as her nipples were suddenly kissed by the 
other two and she found her womanhood touched by a pair of hands.

***************

Kasumi walked quickly to Dr. Tofu&#39;s clinic, determined to ask him 
about his feelings for her.  The images of Akane and Ranma&#39;s night 
together replayed itself in her head; she was definitely ready to make 
love to him if he said he loved her.

On the way to the clinic the old fears had started to reassert 
themselves and she ended up taking an hour to get there, 
backpedaling every few steps.  This wasn&#39;t some minor date.  This 
was about love.  She reached the entrance to the clinic and stopped.  
When they saw her coming, everyone had suddenly left the area.  
Kasumi thought to herself that perhaps he was in love with her; 
everyone certainly seemed willing to grant them some private time 
together.  She took a few deep breaths to steady herself and entered 
the clinic.

It was Sunday, but that never prevented Dr. Tofu from taking 
patients.  He was examining one when she walked in.  Both of them 
gasped her name; Dr. Tofu&#39;s back stiffened while the patient 
suddenly ran out the door, saying that he&#39;d be back tomorrow.

Dr. Tofu:  &quot;Kasumi!  What brings you here?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;I wanted to... to...&quot;
Dr. Tofu:  &quot;Are you feeling all right?  Would you like some tea?&quot;

Dr. Tofu walked out the door.


Marital Arts
Episode 1 - Part 5

Dr. Tofu:  &quot;How strange.  I can&#39;t find my cups.  Or tea pot.  Or 
stove.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Dr. Tofu, I wanted to ask you...&quot;
Dr. Tofu:  &quot;I found some cookies.&quot;

Dr. Tofu enters the clinic with a handful of leaves.

Dr. Tofu:  &quot;I couldn&#39;t find a plate.  But here, I&#39;m sure that they&#39;re 
fresh.&quot;

Dr. Tofu feeds the leaves to his skeleton.

Kasumi:  &quot;How... how do you feel about me, Dr. Tofu?&quot;
Dr. Tofu:  &quot;You seem awfully thin, Kasumi.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;You don&#39;t think I&#39;m attractive!&quot;

Kasumi ran out of the clinic and back toward the dojo as tears 
started to fall from her eyes.

Dr. Tofu:  &quot;Of course I think you&#39;re attractive, Kasumi.  Have you 
	been eating normally?  Your hand seems awfully frail.&quot;

Dr. Tofu pats the skeleton&#39;s hand between his own.

***************

Nodoka had debated with herself whether or not to use the new 
technologies available, but eventually decided that she had to move 
on with the times.  Nabiki left to go upstairs to her room while she 
watched the tape again, taking down notes for improvement.

Nodoka smiled to herself.  Through the earphones she not only 
heard the sounds of passion, but the endearments that she wished for 
her son and Akane.  She was surprised by Akane deciding not to 
pledge, but she saw the look that had passed between Ranko and her 
and understood the decision.

Nodoka took off the earphones.  It wasn&#39;t hard to guess what was 
probably going on upstairs.  Ranko hadn&#39;t returned.  She had 
discovered Ranko in her room the night before, recovering from 
masturbating.  They had talked then about how it wasn&#39;t wrong for 
her to want to make love to both of them, how it was love that 
mattered, not what anyone else thought was acceptable or 
disgusting.  She wasn&#39;t sure she entirely convinced her.

***************

Nabiki wandered upstairs, definitely prepared to relieve her 
horniness with a little self-stimulation since she wasn&#39;t sure how 
Ranma would react if she came on to him.  Since Kasumi left for Dr. 
Tofu&#39;s, maybe she could sneak into her room and use that vibrator 
that Kasumi hid under her mattress.

Of course, she had been shocked to find that Kasumi owned such a 
thing.  She never would have suspected it of her.  That didn&#39;t stop 
her from promptly using it, though, or whenever she felt especially 
horny and Kasumi was busy elsewhere.  And she was definitely 
aroused now, after watching Akane and Ranma doing it on the 
videotape.

She heard voices coming from Ranma and Ranko&#39;s room and 
sneaked down the hall to listen at the door.  When she heard 
Ranko&#39;s voice in addition to Ranma and Akane&#39;s she opened the 
door and entered.  She figured that if Ranma was going to make love 
to them he might as well start now, when she really needed it.  She 
started to take off her clothes and finger herself as she waited for an 
opportunity to join them. 

Ranko moaned as Ranma continued to penetrate her.  She tried to 
keep up as Akane&#39;s juices started to flow down her face.  Above her, 
Ranma was massaging Akane&#39;s breasts from behind, but Ranko 
didn&#39;t notice.  Each impact drove Ranko&#39;s back into the futon, 
causing her breasts to jiggle and making her wish that someone 
would touch or lick them.

Her legs on both sides of Ranko&#39;s head, Akane ground her pussy 
onto Ranko&#39;s mouth as she neared her climax.  With a cry, Akane&#39;s 
body fell forward as Ranko teased her clit, releasing a new flood as 
she collapsed to the floor.  Nabiki quickly moved to Ranko&#39;s side 
and placed her mouth on Ranko&#39;s breast, sucking and rolling the 
hard nub with her tongue.  Akane rolled off of Ranko and sat down 
next to her head, lifting it onto her lap.  Ranko&#39;s hair tickled Akane&#39;s 
belly as she continued to be rocked by Ranma&#39;s motions.  Akane&#39;s 
hand joined Nabiki&#39;s on Ranko&#39;s free breast, her other hand ran 
through Nabiki&#39;s hair.

Ranma continued to bury himself in his sister&#39;s body.  He found it 
easier to maintain his control than he did last night with only Akane 
with him.  He felt Ranko&#39;s body shift in its position but didn&#39;t 
interrupt the rhythm he set for himself.  Finally Ranko&#39;s back arched 
as her muscles started to spasm around him.  When she had 
recovered, Ranma started to pull out of her, still erect.

Ranko seemed almost insulted that he hadn&#39;t cum in her, and was 
prepared to go after him again when she remembered that Nabiki 
was there.  Akane lay Ranma onto his back and brought Nabiki to a 
point directly above his manhood.  As Ranma started to separate her 
nether lips, Nabiki found that Akane in front of her and Ranko in 
back were lowering themselves with her, kissing and running their 
hands across her body.

If any of them had stopped to think about it, they would have 
realized that it had taken them only one day to go from being virgins 
to being synchronized.

***************

Nodoka watched Akane start to straddle Ranma, his hands reaching 
for her breasts.  She watched again what they probably found to be a 
very satisfying session.  She turned off the tape and started upstairs, 
hoping that Ranma and Ranko and Akane were finished for the time 
being.  She could remember what she was like when she was that 
age.  Eager and insatiable.

She listened at the door.  She heard voices from inside; Ranma, 
Ranko, Akane, and Nabiki.  It seemed Nabiki had just finished a 
session riding Ranma to orgasm and now wanted to satisfy him 
orally.  She could hear the scuffling as they formed a small chain - 
Ranma to Ranko to Akane to Nabiki to Ranma.

Something inside her told her that there might be a danger.  She 
knew Nabiki was very oral; it raised the possibility that she might 
access one of the special techniques by accident.  The four of them 
were ready to find pleasure in each other&#39;s bodies, but they were not 
ready for any special technique, especially since it could trigger the 
subconscious defenses set in the others (anticipating the vow, 
Nodoka hadn&#39;t deactivated the children&#39;s defenses toward each 
other).

For a few minutes nothing but normal sounds could be heard 
coming from the door, so she breathed a sigh of relief, but then she 
heard muffled cries coming from inside and threw the door open.  
She knew what it probably was.  The Flutter Tongue.

***************

Kasumi ran though the house and up to her room, where she fell 
onto her bed and cried.  She had worked herself up to confronting 
Dr. Tofu and he had dropped her like any other lovesick girl.  He 
didn&#39;t even think she was attractive.

Kasumi cried a little more.  She had convinced herself that they had 
been perfect for each other.  Perfect and in love.  She had even been 
prepared to throw away...

&#39;Dr. Tofu&#39;.  She had even renamed &#39;Mr. Wonderful&#39; after him.  What 
a mistake that was.

She took out the engraved vibrator from its place under her mattress 
and held it against her tear-streaked cheek.

Kasumi:  &quot;&#39;Mr. Wonderful&#39;... you&#39;re &#39;Mr. Wonderful&#39;!&quot;

Kasumi turned it on as she lifted up her skirt.  She pulled her 
panties to one side and shoved it into herself, hoping the pleasure it 
gave would make her forget her rejection by Dr. Tofu.  She cried out 
as it invaded her dry opening.

She grabbed one of the bedposts with her hand and with the other 
worked the vibrator into her rapidly lubricating sex.  Kasumi&#39;s 
breathing grew ragged as she approached orgasm, penetrating 
herself with abandon.  She cried out as her body released her juices 
onto &#39;Mr. Wonderful&#39; and down onto the bed.

A vision of Dr. Tofu filled her mind as she recovered.  She mentally 
blacked it out and continued to work the vibrator in and out of her 
body, cumming again and again but never able to erase the fantasy 
that it was Dr. Tofu that pleasured her.

Eventually she gave in and started to call out Dr. Tofu&#39;s name as the 
bedsheets become increasingly soaked.

***************

Nodoka left the four exhausted lovers in the room behind her, 
relieved.  It was all her fault for not deactivating the defenses in 
regards to the rest of the family.  Nabiki had performed the Flutter 
Tongue on Ranma, which caused him to perform it on Ranko, then 
on to Akane and back to Nabiki.

If anything, the episode had convinced her of the rightness of the 
decision to take them away to train them properly.  An episode like 
that last one would be too hard to hide, even from Soun and Genma.  
She passed Kasumi&#39;s room and heard the sound of Dr. Tofu&#39;s name 
being yelled out.  She peeked inside.

Kasumi lay on the bed, frantically using the vibrator that she had 
given her.  Judging from the wet spot on the bed she had been at it 
for some time.  Nodoka opened the door and saw Kasumi&#39;s tear-
streaked face, waiting for her to stop on her own before speaking.

Nodoka:  &quot;Kasumi, what is it?&quot;
Kasumi:  [crying]  &quot;Its Dr. Tofu.  He doesn&#39;t love me.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Of course he does.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;No, he doesn&#39;t.  He thinks I&#39;m too skinny.&quot;

Nodoka pondered this while Kasumi lay against her body and she 
hugged Kasumi.  Nodoka absent-mindedly removed the vibrator 
from Kasumi&#39;s body and turned it off.

Nodoka:  &quot;What was he doing when he said this?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;He was by his skeleton.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Kasumi.  Listen to me.  Dr. Tofu is suffering from the 
	Love Hysteria.  He must have mistaken the skeleton for 
	you.&quot;
Kasumi:  [sniffling]  &quot;The Love Hysteria?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;He can&#39;t distinguish between people or objects and he acts 
	very silly when you&#39;re around.  He loves you so much that 
	he can&#39;t function normally around you.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;That&#39;s even worse!&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Why?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;How can I ever tell him I love him if he won&#39;t understand 
	it?  How can he tell me?&quot;

Nodoka looked down at Kasumi.  Perhaps she was ready to hear the 
truth.

Nodoka:  &quot;There is a cure for the Hysteria.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;There is?&quot;
Nodoka:  [nodding]  &quot;You must make love to him.  When he erupts 
	inside of you his mind will snap back to reality, and he will 
	realize what has happened.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Auntie, you seem to know everything.  Should I do it 
	now?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Do you want to start off  your relationship by sleeping 
	with him and then leaving for a month?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;No... I don&#39;t want that...&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;I could eventually arrange for your engagement, if you 
	decide that&#39;s what you want.&quot;

Nodoka felt Kasumi&#39;s body against hers and felt the desire building.  
Strictly speaking, she was Kasumi&#39;s master.  She could order her, 
but that had never been her way.

Nodoka:  &quot;Kasumi... the others are exhausted... are you willing to...&quot;

Kasumi looked up at Nodoka and understood.  No one had thought 
of Nodoka as a woman instead of a mother or auntie.  Kasumi pulled 
back and started to remove the kimono from Nodoka&#39;s body.  As it 
fell to the floor Kasumi found herself wishing that her body would 
remain in as good a shape as she grew older.  When she started to 
suckle at a nipple and Nodoka&#39;s hands found her own, she knew that 
it would be.

***************

Kasumi was the first one to wake up, as always.  She shifted around 
slowly, trying to extricate herself from the tangle of bodies without 
waking anyone.  She removed her nightgown and put on her 
traveling clothes as she looked back at the futon.  Ranma was 
sleeping in his shorts, the others in nightgowns.  She saw Ranma&#39;s 
bare chest and fantasized that it was Dr. Tofu&#39;s.

After their session together, Nodoka had visited Dr. Tofu, reporting 
that he was flattered by her attraction for him and his willingness in 
starting a relationship.  He also understood that as part of a martial 
arts family, she would sometimes go on training trips, and that he 
was willing to wait until she returned before they would start dating.

They had spent the night packing for their trip, but not before she 
and Ranma did it in front of the others, Ranma&#39;s hands on her hips 
as she accepted him from behind.  She was quite embarrassed after 
she had moaned out Dr. Tofu&#39;s name when she climaxed, but Ranma 
understood (before the others joined them again).  Kasumi knew that 
when she returned nothing would keep her from Dr. Tofu, especially 
not herself.

Nodoka woke up not long after her, and the two of them went into 
the kitchen to prepare breakfast.  Ranko and Akane snuggled up to 
Ranma and Nabiki&#39;s hand unconsciously slipped into her panties as 
they lay underneath the blankets.

Marital Arts
Episode 1 - Part 6

Soun Tendo walked through the streets of Nerima with a panda, 
which inevitably drew stares from the crowd, but Genma wouldn&#39;t 
change back to his normal form.  The streets were full of people 
going to work, but the children going to school would stop and try to 
play with Genma.  Genma had said he had come to accept his cursed 
form.  He just hoped Ranma hadn&#39;t.

They had spent the week catching up on the years from their last 
meeting.  Genma had talked about his training trips with the twins 
and Soun talked about raising his daughters and running the dojo.  
Soun couldn&#39;t remember most of what Genma had said because they 
were drunk at the time.

Soun was nervous.  Hung over, too, but mostly nervous.  Today he 
would find out if the union between the two families would be 
finalized.  He remembered when he told his wife about the 
engagement she was furious at his presumption.  Normally she was 
sweet and loving, like Kasumi had become, but she had immediately 
called the Saotomes and worked out the present arrangement with 
Nodoka, then presented it to him with an expression that brooked no 
argument and threatened divorce.

They walked to the front gate of the dojo.  Waiting for them was 
Nodoka and everyone else.  Ranma and Akane were holding hands.  
He started to celebrate with Genma, spreading out fans and dancing 
in the street.  That is, until they tripped over some backpacks.  
Genma knew what that meant.

Nodoka:  &quot;That&#39;s right, dear.  I&#39;m taking the twins on a month-long 
	training trip and the three girls are going with us.&quot;

The panda &#39;growfed&#39; sadly.

Nodoka:  &quot;No, my mind is made up.  They need to take this trip.  Its 
	important.  Remember our deal, dear.&quot;

The panda &#39;growfed&#39; again as he remembered the deal he had made 
with Nodoka when she first allowed him to take the twins on 
training trips.  She allowed him to go without asking anything about 
the training if he would also allow for her own private training trips.  
It made for some incredible lovemaking sessions when they were 
together so he hadn&#39;t regretted the loss of his original plan to take 
the twins on an extended trip that would last years.  Still, she had 
never just left before (they had always taken a few days to get 
reacquainted).

Soun started to cry at the temporary loss of his daughters.

Nodoka whispered in Genma&#39;s ear.

Nodoka:  &quot;I&#39;ll definitely want a &#39;week&#39;s vacation&#39; when I come back, 
	so you&#39;d better get your rest.&quot;

Genma gulps.

Nodoka:  &quot;I&#39;ve gotten a part-time job for you at Dr. Tofu&#39;s clinic.  
	Soun can show you the way.  Keep out of trouble, dear.&quot;

Nodoka left with the children walking behind her as they started on 
their way back to her home.

***************

Shampoo found she had arrived in Nerima a week too late to kill 
Ranma, that she had left with her family and some family named 
Tendo on a training trip.  She looked around the courtyard.  It was 
full of weaklings who probably didn&#39;t know the first thing about 
combat.  Ryoga yelled &quot;Ranma, you coward, running out on me 
again!&quot; and ran off, promptly getting lost.  Good riddance.  Being 
with him probably was what made her late.

One of the students directed her to the Tendo Dojo, where she 
spotted the pet panda.  She followed the panda to some kind of 
health clinic, where it seemed to have some sort of job doing menial 
tasks.  She decided that a trained panda was to valuable a pet to just 
leave; Ranma would surely return for it.

She went up to the man in charge and he hired her as an apprentice 
nurse based on the herbal knowledge that her Great-Grandmother 
had taught her.  He allowed her to stay in one of the spare rooms in 
the clinic.  The panda seemed extremely uncomfortable to see her.

As she fell asleep that night she found herself hoping that Ranma 
would return soon so that she could kill her and go home again.  She 
also thought a little about Dr. Tofu.  Maybe the trip had an added 
bonus; he was attractive and he moved with a fluidness that spoke of 
martial arts and he had medical training as well.  She could 
definitely imagine him making love to her, his tall, muscular body 
looming over her smaller, rounder one as she wrapped her arms and 
legs around him in desire.  She moved a caressing hand to her breast 
as she licked her lips at the thought.

Shampoo quickly jerked her hand back to her side.  First, revenge.
